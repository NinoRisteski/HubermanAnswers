00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.220
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.220 --> 00:13.060
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.060 --> 00:14.980
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.600
 Today, we are going to be discussing bipolar disorder,

00:17.600 --> 00:20.140
 often called bipolar depression.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.420
 Bipolar depression is a condition

00:22.420 --> 00:26.140
 in which people undergo massive shifts in their energy,

00:26.140 --> 00:28.340
 their perception, and their mood.

00:28.340 --> 00:29.920
 However, it is very important to note

00:29.920 --> 00:32.620
 that the shifts in mood, energy, and perception

00:32.620 --> 00:34.340
 are all maladaptive.

00:34.340 --> 00:36.220
 They can often cause tremendous damage

00:36.220 --> 00:39.020
 to the person suffering from bipolar disorder

00:39.020 --> 00:42.300
 and tremendous damage to the people in their lives.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.620
 Today, we're going to parse the biology

00:44.620 --> 00:48.180
 that leads to the shifts in mood, energy, and perception,

00:48.180 --> 00:49.740
 and we are going to talk about

00:49.740 --> 00:51.560
 the various treatments that exist.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.820
 Some of those treatments have been around

00:52.820 --> 00:55.760
 for a very long time, and indeed, one of those treatments,

00:55.760 --> 01:00.380
 lithium, has an incredible backstory about its discovery,

01:00.380 --> 01:02.960
 and in understanding how lithium works

01:02.960 --> 01:05.820
 and some of the ways in which it does not work well,

01:05.820 --> 01:07.300
 it reveals a tremendous amount

01:07.300 --> 01:10.500
 about how the brain works normally in all individuals.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.860
 So that's a miraculous story

01:11.860 --> 01:13.900
 that I look forward to sharing with you.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.980
 As we go forward in this discussion about bipolar disorder,

01:16.980 --> 01:18.060
 I want everyone to keep in mind

01:18.060 --> 01:20.380
 that it is a very severe condition.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.760
 In fact, people suffering from bipolar disorder

01:22.760 --> 01:26.680
 are at 20 to 30 times greater risk of suicide.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.860
 So today is a serious discussion,

01:28.860 --> 01:30.720
 and it's certainly one in which people

01:30.720 --> 01:32.780
 who are suffering from manic bipolar disorder

01:32.780 --> 01:34.180
 or who know people that are suffering

01:34.180 --> 01:37.180
 from manic bipolar disorder can benefit from.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.580
 However, for those of you that might know people

01:39.580 --> 01:43.020
 or who themselves suffer from major depression,

01:43.020 --> 01:45.020
 we will also be talking about important treatment

01:45.020 --> 01:46.860
 developments for major depression.

01:46.860 --> 01:50.360
 Major depression is a very common thing for many people.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.180
 In fact, most people will suffer from depression

01:53.180 --> 01:55.580
 of some sort at some point in their life,

01:55.580 --> 01:58.140
 although not necessarily a major depressive episode,

01:58.140 --> 02:00.980
 and yet major depression is very common.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.860
 So you'll soon learn up to 20% of people

02:02.860 --> 02:04.940
 will suffer from major depression.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.180
 So today's discussion will encompass all of that,

02:07.180 --> 02:10.220
 and it will also encompass basic brain mechanisms

02:10.220 --> 02:12.740
 of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change

02:12.740 --> 02:16.300
 in response to experience both for good and for worse,

02:16.300 --> 02:19.500
 and you'll learn a lot about the basic biology

02:19.500 --> 02:23.300
 of how the brain regulates mood, energy, and perception.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.140
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:25.140 --> 02:27.480
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.940
 We often talk about supplements on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:29.940 --> 02:32.160
 and while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

02:32.160 --> 02:34.300
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

02:34.300 --> 02:37.100
 for things like enhancing the quality and speed

02:37.100 --> 02:38.660
 with which you get into sleep,

02:38.660 --> 02:41.660
 or for enhancing focus, or for hormone support.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.480
 The reason we partnered with Momentous Supplements

02:43.480 --> 02:44.320
 is several fold.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.300
 First of all, their supplements

02:45.300 --> 02:47.060
 are of the absolute highest quality.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.300
 Second of all, they ship internationally,

02:49.300 --> 02:51.780
 which is important because many of our podcast listeners

02:51.780 --> 02:53.420
 reside outside the US.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.420
 Third, many of the supplements that Momentous makes,

02:56.420 --> 02:57.820
 and most all of the supplements

02:57.820 --> 02:59.660
 that we partnered with them directly on

02:59.660 --> 03:01.760
 are single ingredient formulations.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.260
 This is important for a number of reasons.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.580
 First of all, if you're going to create

03:04.580 --> 03:07.380
 a supplement protocol that's customized for your needs,

03:07.380 --> 03:08.620
 you want to be able to figure out

03:08.620 --> 03:10.620
 which supplement ingredients are most essential

03:10.620 --> 03:11.740
 and only use those,

03:11.740 --> 03:13.720
 and supplements that combine lots of ingredients

03:13.720 --> 03:15.300
 simply won't allow you to do that.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.440
 If you'd like to see the supplements

03:16.440 --> 03:18.180
 that we partnered with Momentous on,

03:18.180 --> 03:21.260
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

03:21.260 --> 03:23.300
 and there you'll see many of the supplements

03:23.300 --> 03:24.740
 that we've talked repeatedly about

03:24.740 --> 03:26.980
 on the Huberman Lab podcast episodes.

03:26.980 --> 03:29.420
 I should mention that the catalog of supplements

03:29.420 --> 03:32.060
 that are available at livemomentous.com slash Huberman

03:32.060 --> 03:33.860
 is constantly being expanded,

03:33.860 --> 03:37.200
 so you can check back there livemomentous.com slash Huberman

03:37.200 --> 03:38.940
 to see what's currently available,

03:38.940 --> 03:40.160
 and from time to time,

03:40.160 --> 03:42.780
 you'll notice new supplements being added to the inventory.

03:42.780 --> 03:44.100
 Before we dive into the discussion

03:44.100 --> 03:45.260
 about manic bipolar disorder,

03:45.260 --> 03:46.900
 I want to highlight some recent findings

03:46.900 --> 03:49.780
 in an area totally separate from mental health

03:49.780 --> 03:52.180
 that I think are really important for everyone to know about.

03:52.180 --> 03:54.180
 This is a paper published in the journal Cell,

03:54.180 --> 03:56.260
 which is a Cell Press journal, an excellent journal,

03:56.260 --> 03:58.100
 in fact, one of the three apex journals,

03:58.100 --> 03:59.660
 so for those of you that are curious,

03:59.660 --> 04:02.780
 papers published in the journal Nature, Science, and Cell

04:02.780 --> 04:06.260
 are considered the sort of Super Bowl, Stanley Cup,

04:06.260 --> 04:08.400
 and NBA championships of publishing,

04:08.400 --> 04:10.500
 and this paper entitled

04:10.500 --> 04:13.580
 An Interorgan Neural Circuit for Appetite Suppression

04:13.580 --> 04:15.360
 illustrates a very important principle

04:15.360 --> 04:16.940
 that I think everyone should know about,

04:16.940 --> 04:20.420
 and that's the principle of so-called parallel pathways.

04:20.420 --> 04:23.500
 Parallel pathways, as the name suggests, are pathways.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.880
 They could be neural pathways or hormonal pathways

04:26.880 --> 04:30.400
 or otherwise that operate independently of one another

04:30.400 --> 04:33.000
 to accomplish a common goal,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.740
 and what this paper really shows

04:34.740 --> 04:38.620
 is that there's a set of peptides in the body,

04:38.620 --> 04:40.660
 and the peptide that I'm referring to today

04:40.660 --> 04:44.380
 is called GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide one,

04:44.380 --> 04:45.700
 and some related peptides.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.940
 I've talked about these on the podcast before

04:47.940 --> 04:48.780
 for two reasons.

04:48.780 --> 04:52.460
 First of all, I'm a big proponent and consumer

04:52.460 --> 04:55.000
 of Yerba Mate, Yerba Mate is a tea

04:55.000 --> 04:58.980
 that can promote the release of glucagon-like peptide one,

04:58.980 --> 05:01.620
 and there are also new prescription drugs

05:01.620 --> 05:02.940
 that are now hitting the market

05:02.940 --> 05:05.040
 and for which there are really impressive clinical trials

05:05.040 --> 05:06.940
 for diabetes and obesity

05:06.940 --> 05:11.220
 that are essentially glucagon-like peptide one stimulators,

05:11.220 --> 05:12.420
 so they stimulate the release of that,

05:12.420 --> 05:15.260
 or they are in fact a synthetic version

05:15.260 --> 05:16.900
 of glucagon-like peptide one.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.100
 What is glucagon-like peptide one?

05:19.100 --> 05:21.940
 It is a peptide, which is a small little protein

05:21.940 --> 05:25.100
 that can dramatically suppress appetite,

05:25.100 --> 05:27.460
 so that's why these drugs are being explored

05:27.460 --> 05:30.300
 and are showing quite impressive results

05:30.300 --> 05:33.180
 for things like treatment of type 2 diabetes

05:33.180 --> 05:36.460
 and other forms of diabetes as well as obesity,

05:36.460 --> 05:38.020
 so they lead to weight loss.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.940
 Now, in terms of the Yerba Mate stimulation

05:39.940 --> 05:41.260
 of glucagon-like peptide one,

05:41.260 --> 05:43.860
 that's going to be a much lower amount of glucagon-like

05:43.860 --> 05:46.640
 peptide one that's released from drinking Yerba Mate

05:46.640 --> 05:50.100
 as opposed to, say, taking a drug that stimulates GLP-1

05:50.100 --> 05:52.520
 or taking a drug that is GLP-1.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.260
 Nonetheless, I should also point out

05:55.260 --> 05:58.600
 that Yerba Mate comes in a bunch of different forms.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.040
 There is some concern about certain smoky-flavored forms

06:03.040 --> 06:05.280
 of Yerba Mate being carcinogenic,

06:05.280 --> 06:07.800
 so that's why I avoid those forms of Yerba Mate,

06:07.800 --> 06:10.160
 but for me, Yerba Mate is one of the preferred sources

06:10.160 --> 06:11.280
 of caffeine for me.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.480
 I like the way it tastes.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.420
 It does provide that sort of caffeine kick

06:14.420 --> 06:15.660
 that I like to have early in the day

06:15.660 --> 06:18.220
 for focus and for work and for exercise,

06:18.220 --> 06:20.920
 and yet I actively avoid the smoked varieties

06:20.920 --> 06:24.040
 of Yerba Mate because of the potential carcinogenic effects

06:24.040 --> 06:26.280
 of the smoked varieties.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.000
 Glucagon-like peptide one, as I mentioned earlier,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.420
 can suppress appetite, but what this paper shows

06:32.420 --> 06:35.780
 is it does that by at least two mechanisms

06:35.780 --> 06:37.680
 through parallel pathways.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.320
 What this paper shows is that glucagon-like peptide one

06:41.320 --> 06:43.160
 acts on receptors in the body

06:43.160 --> 06:44.600
 in a portion of the nervous system

06:44.600 --> 06:48.200
 called the enteric nervous system, E-N-T-E-R-I-C,

06:48.200 --> 06:49.960
 enteric nervous system.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.240
 This is a component of your nervous system

06:51.240 --> 06:52.820
 that you don't really have control over.

06:52.820 --> 06:55.240
 It's autonomic or automatic.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.240
 GLP-1 binds to what are called

06:57.240 --> 06:59.820
 intestinal fugal enteric neurons.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.000
 You don't need to know the name,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.700
 but those neurons do two things.

07:02.700 --> 07:06.220
 First of all, they cause some gut distension,

07:06.220 --> 07:08.360
 so they actually make you feel full.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.480
 This is incredible, right?

07:09.480 --> 07:11.860
 A peptide, not actual physical food,

07:11.860 --> 07:15.240
 but a peptide that stimulates neurons

07:15.240 --> 07:18.380
 that cause changes in the so-called mechanoreceptors

07:18.380 --> 07:20.840
 of the gut of the enteric nervous system

07:20.840 --> 07:22.560
 and make people feel full.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.560
 So it can lead to actually mild,

07:24.560 --> 07:27.100
 or I suppose if levels of GLP-1 are very high,

07:27.100 --> 07:29.360
 to major gut distension, okay?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.000
 I think that the levels of GLP-1

07:31.000 --> 07:32.440
 that would come from drinking Yerba Mate

07:32.440 --> 07:34.480
 and hopefully from appropriate dosaging

07:34.480 --> 07:37.560
 of the synthetic forms of GLP-1

07:37.560 --> 07:40.060
 or drugs that stimulate GLP-1 would cause mild,

07:40.060 --> 07:41.240
 not major gut distension

07:41.240 --> 07:43.680
 because major gut distension would be uncomfortable.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.040
 So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut

07:46.040 --> 07:48.380
 to increase gut distension

07:48.380 --> 07:51.680
 and by way of a pathway that goes from the gut

07:51.680 --> 07:54.160
 up to the hypothalamus, this little cluster of neurons

07:54.160 --> 07:55.480
 about the size of a marble

07:55.480 --> 07:57.060
 that sits above the roof of your mouth

07:57.060 --> 08:00.560
 is also suppressing appetite through brain mechanisms.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.980
 So this is really beautiful, right?

08:01.980 --> 08:04.120
 You have a peptide, a small little protein

08:04.120 --> 08:06.080
 that's released in the gut

08:06.080 --> 08:10.520
 and that release within the gut causes gut distension

08:10.520 --> 08:11.720
 which makes you feel full

08:11.720 --> 08:14.800
 and by way of neural stimulation of the hypothalamus

08:14.800 --> 08:17.320
 also activates neural pathways within the brain

08:17.320 --> 08:18.600
 that trigger satiety,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.640
 the feeling of having had enough food.

08:20.640 --> 08:24.400
 So to me, GLP-1 is both impressive and important, why?

08:24.400 --> 08:26.760
 Because this recent category of drugs

08:26.760 --> 08:30.680
 that's now hitting the market seems to adjust obesity

08:30.680 --> 08:32.060
 or can help people with weight loss

08:32.060 --> 08:33.800
 in order to help their health

08:33.800 --> 08:36.400
 and it's doing so by at least two mechanisms.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.460
 One is within the brain

08:37.460 --> 08:40.400
 and the other is within the gut and communication

08:40.400 --> 08:42.640
 through the so-called gut brain access

08:42.640 --> 08:44.400
 because again, these enteric neurons

08:44.400 --> 08:47.360
 are communicating to the brain, the hypothalamus

08:47.360 --> 08:48.840
 by way of this what's called

08:48.840 --> 08:52.580
 the sympathogastrospinal reticular hypothalamic pathway.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.680
 You absolutely do not need to know all of that.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.520
 That's a mouthful.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.500
 That's enough to make your mouth feel distended

08:57.500 --> 09:00.440
 but at the same time, things like yerba mate

09:00.440 --> 09:02.320
 and I'm sure there are other compounds out there as well

09:02.320 --> 09:05.380
 but certainly yerba mate can stimulate the release of GLP-1.

09:05.380 --> 09:06.500
 So for those of you that are looking

09:06.500 --> 09:08.400
 for some mild appetite suppression

09:08.400 --> 09:11.440
 and want to accomplish that while also ingesting caffeine,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.360
 yerba mate might be a good option for that

09:13.360 --> 09:16.240
 and just know that it's operating through two mechanisms

09:16.240 --> 09:18.040
 on the body through mild gut distension

09:18.040 --> 09:19.520
 to make you feel full and on the brain

09:19.520 --> 09:22.240
 to increase satiety or make you feel less hungry.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.800
 And then for everybody,

09:23.800 --> 09:26.440
 not just those that are interested in appetite suppression,

09:26.440 --> 09:28.440
 I think it's important to understand

09:28.440 --> 09:30.640
 that these parallel pathways are fundamental

09:30.640 --> 09:32.140
 to how we are organized.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.500
 Another good example of this would be

09:33.500 --> 09:36.000
 when we are excited by something, positive or negative,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.520
 so it could be stressful or we're positively aroused,

09:38.520 --> 09:41.840
 there is a parallel activation of epinephrine, adrenaline,

09:41.840 --> 09:44.040
 both from your adrenals and from an area in the brain

09:44.040 --> 09:45.480
 called the locus coeruleus.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.760
 So again and again, we see this in biology

09:47.760 --> 09:49.020
 and in neuroscience,

09:49.020 --> 09:52.120
 that your brain and your body are acting in concert.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.400
 They're acting together through mechanisms

09:54.400 --> 09:56.860
 that either are independent, so separately in the brain

09:56.860 --> 09:58.120
 and separately in the body,

09:58.120 --> 10:00.640
 but directed towards a common goal

10:00.640 --> 10:03.140
 or through communication between brain and body

10:03.140 --> 10:04.440
 and almost always,

10:04.440 --> 10:06.640
 that communication is going to be bi-directional,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.600
 body to brain and brain to body.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.440
 So I think these results are really interesting

10:10.440 --> 10:12.400
 and really important for sake of weight loss,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.360
 for sake of appetite suppression

10:14.360 --> 10:16.760
 and just generally for the way that they illustrate

10:16.760 --> 10:20.240
 this very important theme of the way that we are constructed

10:20.240 --> 10:23.200
 at a biological level, which is parallel pathways.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.840
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

10:25.840 --> 10:28.520
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.600
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

10:30.600 --> 10:33.180
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

10:33.180 --> 10:35.760
 and science related tools to the general public.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.880
 In keeping with that theme,

10:36.880 --> 10:39.600
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.040
 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.440
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

10:44.440 --> 10:47.000
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

10:47.000 --> 10:48.600
 to help you better understand your body

10:48.600 --> 10:50.600
 and help you reach your health goals.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.320
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

10:53.320 --> 10:55.620
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

10:55.620 --> 10:57.760
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

10:57.760 --> 11:00.120
 can only be assessed with a quality blood test.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.960
 And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,

11:02.960 --> 11:04.860
 you can also get insight into, for instance,

11:04.860 --> 11:06.440
 what your biological age is

11:06.440 --> 11:08.440
 and compare that to your chronological age.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.400
 And of course, your biological age is the one

11:10.400 --> 11:11.960
 that's important for your longevity

11:11.960 --> 11:14.360
 and your understanding of your current health needs.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.880
 One major problem with most blood tests

11:15.880 --> 11:17.960
 and DNA tests out there, however,

11:17.960 --> 11:19.280
 is that you get information back

11:19.280 --> 11:20.960
 about levels of metabolic factors,

11:20.960 --> 11:23.300
 levels of hormones and lipids and so forth,

11:23.300 --> 11:25.860
 but you don't know exactly what to do with that information.

11:25.860 --> 11:27.600
 InsideTracker solves that problem

11:27.600 --> 11:29.300
 through their personalized platform,

11:29.300 --> 11:31.760
 which can tell you, for instance, lifestyle factors

11:31.760 --> 11:35.300
 like fitness or nutrition or supplementation

11:35.300 --> 11:36.720
 that you can use to bring the numbers

11:36.720 --> 11:39.240
 into the ranges that are ideal for your health needs.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.640
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.960
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

11:53.960 --> 11:55.760
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

11:55.760 --> 11:56.600
 The company was founded

11:56.600 --> 11:58.440
 by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,

11:58.440 --> 12:00.800
 and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

12:00.800 --> 12:03.100
 were designed with performance in mind.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.880
 I've spent a lifetime working on the biology

12:04.880 --> 12:05.720
 of the visual system,

12:05.720 --> 12:08.080
 and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend

12:08.080 --> 12:09.840
 with a number of very important challenges

12:09.840 --> 12:11.520
 in order for you to see clearly.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.480
 The designers of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

12:13.480 --> 12:15.600
 understand this, and for that reason,

12:15.600 --> 12:18.000
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses allow you, for instance,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.200
 to move from a shady area to a bright area

12:20.200 --> 12:21.920
 or from a bright area to a shady area

12:21.920 --> 12:24.340
 and still see everything with crystal clarity.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.000
 Originally, their glasses and sunglasses

12:26.000 --> 12:27.520
 were designed for performance,

12:27.520 --> 12:29.000
 that is, for running and cycling,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.400
 and as a consequence, the eyeglasses and sunglasses

12:31.400 --> 12:32.880
 stay on your face even if you get sweaty,

12:32.880 --> 12:34.140
 and they're extremely lightweight.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.040
 In fact, most of the time,

12:35.040 --> 12:36.780
 I don't even realize that they're on my face.

12:36.780 --> 12:39.720
 I wear Roca eyeglasses for reading and for driving at night,

12:39.720 --> 12:41.680
 and I wear their sunglasses when I'm out during the day,

12:41.680 --> 12:44.240
 and it's really bright, and I need to use sunglasses

12:44.240 --> 12:46.860
 in order to be able to navigate in that bright sunlight.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.240
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

12:48.240 --> 12:51.160
 you can go to Roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,

12:51.160 --> 12:53.520

12:53.520 --> 12:54.580
 your first order.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.800
 Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,

12:56.800 --> 12:58.980
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

12:58.980 --> 13:01.560
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.280
 Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books

13:04.280 --> 13:07.740
 condensed down to just 15 minutes each of key takeaways

13:07.740 --> 13:09.380
 that you can read or listen to.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.460
 I'm a big believer in reading physical books.

13:11.460 --> 13:14.800
 I actually own a lot of hardcover books and paperback books,

13:14.800 --> 13:15.940
 and I like holding them in my hand

13:15.940 --> 13:17.200
 and flipping through the pages.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.160
 I also like listening to audio books,

13:19.160 --> 13:22.280
 but the reality is I don't have a ton of time to read books,

13:22.280 --> 13:23.180
 and I don't have a lot of time

13:23.180 --> 13:25.080
 to listen to entire audio books.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.980
 There are also a lot of books that I've really enjoyed

13:26.980 --> 13:29.100
 in the past that I have read in their entirety,

13:29.100 --> 13:31.280
 but that I like to update myself on the information on

13:31.280 --> 13:32.560
 every once in a while.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.320
 Blinkist has terrific books available.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.000
 For instance, I'm a big fan of Tim Ferriss's

13:36.000 --> 13:39.280
 "'4-Hour Body," gleaned so much knowledge from that book,

13:39.280 --> 13:40.820
 also from Nassim Taleb's book,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.580
 "'The Black Swan," and the great Matt Walker's book,

13:43.580 --> 13:45.280
 "'Why We Sleep," which is a book

13:45.280 --> 13:46.360
 that I've read several times,

13:46.360 --> 13:49.560
 and I actually listened to the synopsis of on Blinkist

13:49.560 --> 13:52.160
 over and over because there's so many key takeaways.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.200
 With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to read

13:54.200 --> 13:55.720
 or listen to a massive library

13:55.720 --> 13:57.720
 of condensed nonfiction books,

13:57.720 --> 13:58.740
 essentially all of the books

13:58.740 --> 14:00.420
 that you ever wanted to listen to,

14:00.420 --> 14:02.180
 and now you have time because they're condensed

14:02.180 --> 14:03.760
 down to just 15 minutes each.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.300
 Right now, Blinkist has a special offer

14:05.300 --> 14:07.220

14:23.380 --> 14:25.100
 Let's talk about bipolar disorder.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.200
 And today I'm going to refer to bipolar disorder

14:27.200 --> 14:30.320
 interchangeably with bipolar depression.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.320
 Although, as you will soon learn,

14:32.320 --> 14:34.320
 not everyone with bipolar disorder

14:34.320 --> 14:37.520
 necessarily goes through highs and lows.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.880
 There is a subset of people who suffer from bipolar disorder

14:40.880 --> 14:42.840
 who experienced the manic phases,

14:42.840 --> 14:45.920
 the highly elevated mood and energy,

14:45.920 --> 14:48.600
 and then dropped down to so-called baseline.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.760
 So they don't necessarily go down into a depressive state.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.420
 They often will return to a somewhat normal state.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.640
 In fact, we will talk about the percentage of time

14:57.640 --> 14:59.340
 that people with bipolar disorder

14:59.340 --> 15:02.840
 tend to be symptom-free, manic, or depressed

15:02.840 --> 15:04.440
 in the context of the different categories

15:04.440 --> 15:05.680
 of bipolar disorder.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.120
 But as we wade into this topic that is bipolar disorder,

15:09.120 --> 15:10.040
 I just want to give you a little bit

15:10.040 --> 15:12.680
 of the background statistics to anchor us

15:12.680 --> 15:16.840
 in just how serious and prevalent bipolar disorder is.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.260
 So bipolar disorder impacts about 1% of people.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.560
 That might seem like a small percentage,

15:22.560 --> 15:25.240
 but if you think about a room of 100 people,

15:25.240 --> 15:27.080
 that means that at least one of them

15:27.080 --> 15:30.680
 is very likely to have bipolar disorder.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.880
 And as I mentioned earlier in the introduction,

15:32.880 --> 15:35.260
 bipolar disorder is very serious.

15:35.260 --> 15:39.720
 It has a 20 to 30% greater incidence of suicide

15:39.720 --> 15:41.400
 than the general population,

15:41.400 --> 15:42.660
 which is, first of all,

15:42.660 --> 15:45.540
 extremely tragic and extremely concerning.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.560
 So anyone that thinks they might have bipolar disorder

15:48.560 --> 15:50.240
 or who knows someone with bipolar disorder

15:50.240 --> 15:52.120
 should be especially vigilant about this.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.840
 And we'll talk about some of the signs and risk factors,

15:55.840 --> 15:58.720
 age of onset, et cetera, as we move forward.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.100
 So 1% of people have bipolar disorder.

16:01.100 --> 16:05.180
 The typical age of onset is anywhere from 20 to 25 years old

16:05.180 --> 16:07.580
 although it can be much earlier.

16:07.580 --> 16:11.420
 And the earlier the onset of a bipolar episode,

16:11.420 --> 16:13.160
 which we will define in a few minutes,

16:13.160 --> 16:15.640
 the earlier the onset of that episode,

16:15.640 --> 16:18.480
 the higher likelihood that the bipolar disorder

16:18.480 --> 16:20.260
 is going to be a stable feature

16:20.260 --> 16:22.960
 of that person's psychology going forward.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.740
 And yet, I also want to point out

16:24.740 --> 16:27.120
 that there are some very good treatments

16:27.120 --> 16:28.040
 for bipolar disorder

16:28.040 --> 16:30.660
 that those people could still benefit from.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.940
 There are basically two kinds of bipolar disorder

16:33.940 --> 16:36.980
 referred to as bipolar I and bipolar II.

16:36.980 --> 16:39.760
 So let's just talk about bipolar I first.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.840
 Bipolar I is characterized

16:41.840 --> 16:45.080
 by a fairly extended period of mania.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.200
 What is mania?

16:46.200 --> 16:50.200
 Mania is a period of very elevated mood, energy,

16:50.200 --> 16:53.520
 distractibility, impulsivity, and some other symptomology

16:53.520 --> 16:55.600
 that we'll talk about going forward.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.640
 But this manic episode is extreme.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.520
 This is a condition in which the energy lift,

17:03.520 --> 17:06.580
 the mood lift, and the sort of impulsivity

17:06.580 --> 17:08.760
 and actions and words of the person

17:08.760 --> 17:10.640
 suffering from manic bipolar disorder

17:10.640 --> 17:13.800
 are very noticeable and very extreme.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.160
 Now, a key thing, however,

17:15.160 --> 17:16.960
 is that it's not always noticeable

17:16.960 --> 17:18.920
 to the person suffering from it

17:18.920 --> 17:20.440
 that they are in this mode.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.740
 Sometimes they recognize that, sometimes they don't,

17:22.740 --> 17:25.920
 but it's always highly recognizable to other people

17:25.920 --> 17:29.200
 that the person suffering from manic bipolar disorder

17:29.200 --> 17:30.960
 is not like other people.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.480
 So let's talk about bipolar I in a little bit more depth.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.680
 One of the key clinical criteria

17:36.680 --> 17:39.100
 or diagnostic criteria for bipolar I

17:39.100 --> 17:42.640
 is that a person suffer from these manic episodes

17:42.640 --> 17:46.600
 or display these manic episodes for seven days or more.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.720
 That turns out to be very key.

17:47.720 --> 17:51.760
 The stability of that manic episode for seven days or more

17:51.760 --> 17:53.880
 turns out to be very important.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.880
 And for those seven days,

17:55.880 --> 17:59.260
 the person is in an elevated mood, expansive thought

17:59.260 --> 18:02.400
 all day, every day for those seven days.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.520
 Now, there are a lot of reasons

18:03.520 --> 18:06.240
 why somebody could be in a manic mode.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.660
 It doesn't necessarily mean

18:07.660 --> 18:09.720
 that somebody has bipolar disorder.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.840
 In fact, someone could be in a manic mode

18:11.840 --> 18:13.620
 for seven days or more

18:13.620 --> 18:15.880
 and still not be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

18:15.880 --> 18:16.720
 Why?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.720
 Well, there are other things

18:18.720 --> 18:20.640
 that can create manic episodes,

18:20.640 --> 18:22.520
 things like traumatic brain injury,

18:22.520 --> 18:23.820
 things like seizure,

18:23.820 --> 18:26.400
 things like various prescription drugs or illicit drugs,

18:26.400 --> 18:28.560
 things like amphetamine and cocaine.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.800
 That is not the same as bipolar disorder,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.040
 even though from a symptomology perspective,

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
 they might look even identical.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.340
 So let's think about these symptoms

18:37.340 --> 18:41.000
 and the diagnostic criteria that a psychiatrist would use

18:41.000 --> 18:44.020
 in order to ask whether or not someone is manic

18:44.020 --> 18:46.480
 because they have manic bipolar disorder

18:46.480 --> 18:48.400
 or whether or not that person is manic

18:48.400 --> 18:50.040
 for some other reason,

18:50.040 --> 18:53.500
 such as traumatic brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.800
 So typically a person will be brought into a clinic

18:57.800 --> 19:00.680
 or a person would bring themselves to a clinic

19:00.680 --> 19:02.480
 or meet with a psychiatrist.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.520
 It seems more likely that they would be directed

19:04.520 --> 19:05.520
 toward a psychiatrist

19:05.520 --> 19:08.140
 because oftentimes people who are in a manic episode

19:08.140 --> 19:10.320
 just simply won't have the perspective

19:10.320 --> 19:13.480
 or the foresight to bring themselves into the clinic.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.200
 And the psychiatrist is going to start to evaluate

19:16.200 --> 19:17.800
 for a couple of different things.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.240
 But first of all, what they're going to try and figure out

19:20.240 --> 19:22.680
 is whether or not the person has at least three

19:22.680 --> 19:24.700
 of the following symptoms.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.280
 The first symptom is distractibility.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.400
 Is the person distractible?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.920
 Are they going from one thing to the next?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.260
 People who are in a manic episode

19:32.260 --> 19:33.240
 will be talking about a pen

19:33.240 --> 19:34.580
 and then they'll be talking about, you know,

19:34.580 --> 19:35.580
 something they saw the other day

19:35.580 --> 19:36.680
 and then something they want to purchase

19:36.680 --> 19:38.680
 and then a place they're going to travel to, et cetera.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.780
 But they are also very prone to any stimulus

19:41.780 --> 19:44.300
 within the room, meaning, you know, a bell could go off

19:44.300 --> 19:45.480
 or there could be a sound out in the hallway

19:45.480 --> 19:46.460
 and they'll orient to that.

19:46.460 --> 19:47.800
 And then they'll orient to the clinician

19:47.800 --> 19:49.480
 and then they'll orient to something in their pocket.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.780
 So they're all over the place.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.280
 You could think of this a little bit like ADHD

19:53.280 --> 19:56.340
 or attention deficit disorder, but it's very extreme.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.060
 So highly distractible, highly impulsive.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.680
 Impulsivity relates to actions.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.640
 So the person might be fidgeting with something

20:03.640 --> 20:05.220
 and then they might try and leave the room

20:05.220 --> 20:08.640
 or the person might, if they were out in the real world,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.720
 somebody might notice that the person is going

20:11.720 --> 20:14.360
 and purchasing, you know, multiples of something

20:14.360 --> 20:16.760
 that would be unusual for someone to purchase.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.560
 So for instance, I happen to know someone

20:18.560 --> 20:21.060
 whose ex-spouse had bipolar disorder

20:21.060 --> 20:22.800
 and their ex-spouse went out

20:22.800 --> 20:25.960
 and bought 10 plus air fryers, right?

20:25.960 --> 20:27.640
 I mean, I think unless you're a restaurant

20:27.640 --> 20:28.840
 that's using a lot of air fryers,

20:28.840 --> 20:30.480
 the idea that you would need more than one

20:30.480 --> 20:33.280
 or two air fryers might just seem

20:33.280 --> 20:34.880
 a little bit out of the norm.

20:34.880 --> 20:38.000
 And so that impulsivity can be purchasing.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.960
 It can be other things as well.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.420
 It could be booking, you know, 12 international trips

20:42.420 --> 20:45.480
 in one afternoon or going and buying three cars, et cetera.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.640
 So impulsivity.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.640
 The other is grandiosity.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.240
 People who have manic bipolar disorder

20:51.240 --> 20:55.440
 who are in a manic episode will often display words of

20:55.440 --> 20:57.160
 or actions of grandiosity.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.700
 And keep in mind, these are not lies

20:59.700 --> 21:01.520
 in the sense that the person isn't lying

21:01.520 --> 21:04.120
 in order to try and pull one over on anybody.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.960
 These are actual beliefs that the person comes to have

21:06.960 --> 21:09.820
 about their grandiose position in the world

21:09.820 --> 21:13.200
 or grandiose opportunities or potential in the world.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.600
 Typical forms of grandiosity in manic episodes would be

21:16.600 --> 21:18.100
 that the person suddenly decides

21:18.100 --> 21:20.080
 that they are going to win a Pulitzer Prize.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.200
 They are the person selected to win a Pulitzer Prize.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.200
 They're going to write a novel that afternoon

21:24.200 --> 21:26.320
 and they're going to win a Pulitzer Prize that year,

21:26.320 --> 21:29.480
 which is more or less a delusion of grandeur, right?

21:29.480 --> 21:31.340
 The idea that someone could do that in one afternoon,

21:31.340 --> 21:35.220
 I suppose it is possible in the realm of all possibilities,

21:35.220 --> 21:37.720
 but it's extremely unlikely.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.080
 Other forms of grandiosity that often present themselves

21:41.080 --> 21:43.440
 in people suffering from a manic episode

21:43.440 --> 21:45.440
 will be that they're going to run for president

21:45.440 --> 21:50.440
 or that they are the person that they believe is selected

21:50.560 --> 21:53.480
 by the citizens of a given country

21:53.480 --> 21:56.980
 or by the universe to be the president of that country

21:56.980 --> 21:58.780
 or to be president of the universe, right?

21:58.780 --> 22:01.360
 It sounds ridiculous, but those sorts of delusions

22:01.360 --> 22:04.720
 of grandiosity are one condition that often presents itself

22:04.720 --> 22:07.740
 or one set of symptoms that presents itself.

22:07.740 --> 22:11.160
 Flight of ideas are also typical of manic episodes.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.000
 So this is a little bit like distractibility,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.040
 but this would be people talking extensively about one thing

22:16.040 --> 22:17.960
 and then switching and talking extensively

22:17.960 --> 22:18.800
 about something else.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.480
 It would be as if I was doing this podcast,

22:20.480 --> 22:21.800
 talking about manic bipolar disorder,

22:21.800 --> 22:23.600
 and then suddenly switching to OCD

22:23.600 --> 22:25.200
 and then to deliberate cold exposure

22:25.200 --> 22:27.040
 and then to the role of sugar

22:27.040 --> 22:28.480
 and its impact on the brain, et cetera.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.560
 So essentially a random selection

22:31.560 --> 22:34.800
 of the different topics that exist in science,

22:34.800 --> 22:36.520
 all of which I happen to be very interested in

22:36.520 --> 22:39.980
 and curious about, but just as we have episodes

22:39.980 --> 22:42.560
 of the podcast that are about one or two topics

22:42.560 --> 22:45.120
 and we focus on those in a fairly narrow trench

22:45.120 --> 22:48.460
 of discussion, somebody who has a flight of ideas

22:48.460 --> 22:51.960
 would be jumping between categories and topics

22:51.960 --> 22:53.600
 in a kind of pseudo random way.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.700
 So they might take off down a path of one thing

22:55.700 --> 22:58.320
 and then switch to another without any transition

22:58.320 --> 22:59.960
 or with transitions that don't have

22:59.960 --> 23:02.000
 any logical structure to them.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.060
 The other aspect of manic bipolar disorder

23:05.060 --> 23:07.160
 that often presents itself in the manic episodes

23:07.160 --> 23:10.060
 are agitation, people feeling extremely physically agitated,

23:10.060 --> 23:12.240
 so a lot of shaking and moving about.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.560
 This can venture into the realm of paranoia,

23:14.560 --> 23:17.880
 but a lot of agitation, a difficulty sitting down

23:17.880 --> 23:22.100
 and being still, a difficulty in just looking,

23:22.100 --> 23:24.920
 feeling and acting calm.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.000
 And then another condition is no sleep.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.820
 And when I say no sleep, I mean no sleep

23:30.820 --> 23:32.980
 or very minimal sleep.

23:32.980 --> 23:36.920
 As incredible as it sounds, people who are in a manic episode

23:36.920 --> 23:40.920
 can often go seven days or more with zero sleep.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.000
 And a key feature of this zero sleep

23:43.000 --> 23:44.240
 is that they're not troubled by it.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.520
 They're not thinking, oh, I'm suffering from insomnia

23:46.520 --> 23:47.720
 and I really, really want to sleep.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.340
 Sometimes that's the case, but more often than not,

23:50.340 --> 23:51.940
 they are simply not sleeping.

23:51.940 --> 23:54.760
 They're staying up 24 hours, then another 24 hours,

23:54.760 --> 23:56.940
 it just continues for an entire week.

23:56.940 --> 23:59.020
 Again, inconceivable to those of us

23:59.020 --> 24:01.520
 that don't suffer from manic episodes,

24:01.520 --> 24:04.960
 can only imagine how pulled apart most of us would feel

24:04.960 --> 24:07.680
 under those conditions and yet they are just going

24:07.680 --> 24:11.480
 and going and going with no sleep up all hours,

24:11.480 --> 24:14.680
 shopping, talking, running,

24:14.680 --> 24:16.140
 doing all sorts of different things

24:16.140 --> 24:17.560
 in the categories of other symptoms

24:17.560 --> 24:19.160
 that we talked about before.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.360
 And it doesn't bother them that they're not sleeping.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.620
 And then the last sort of category of symptoms

24:25.620 --> 24:27.780
 that the psychiatrist is evaluating for

24:27.780 --> 24:31.560
 and seeing if they present is rapid pressured speech.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.440
 The rapid pressured speech is something

24:33.440 --> 24:35.200
 that when you hear it, you recognize it.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.120
 This is somebody that almost seems to be hitting you

24:37.120 --> 24:39.640
 a speech like machine gun fire.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.640
 It's coming at you, coming at you, coming at you,

24:41.640 --> 24:43.840
 and there's really no room for conversation.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.860
 They're not offering any opportunity for a back and forth,

24:46.860 --> 24:47.840
 or if there is a back and forth,

24:47.840 --> 24:49.160
 they might ask you how you feel about something

24:49.160 --> 24:51.520
 and then you started, well, then they're going to hit you

24:51.520 --> 24:55.680
 with another barrage or a paragraph of information

24:55.680 --> 24:58.080
 or of just speech that's pseudo random.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.100
 So we've got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity,

25:01.100 --> 25:04.120
 flight of ideas, agitation, no sleep,

25:04.120 --> 25:06.240
 and rapid pressured speech.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.120
 For someone to be diagnosed as in a manic episode,

25:09.120 --> 25:11.960
 they do not have to be engaging in

25:11.960 --> 25:15.300
 or displaying all of those symptoms.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.640
 They do, however, need to present

25:17.640 --> 25:19.560
 at least three of those symptoms.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.080
 And then in order to meet the condition of bipolar I,

25:23.080 --> 25:25.240
 they have to be presenting those three symptoms

25:25.240 --> 25:27.780
 for at least seven days.

25:27.780 --> 25:30.880
 It could be longer, but at least seven days.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.140
 Now, this seems pretty straightforward, right?

25:34.140 --> 25:36.620
 At one level, the way that I describe this

25:36.620 --> 25:38.440
 and the way that it exists in the clinical literature,

25:38.440 --> 25:40.380
 you could think, well, this should be pretty easy

25:40.380 --> 25:43.080
 to diagnose, and yet there's a complication there

25:43.080 --> 25:45.640
 or a challenge there because the psychiatrist, again,

25:45.640 --> 25:48.220
 has to determine that these manic episodes

25:48.220 --> 25:53.220
 are not due to something other than bipolar disorder.

25:53.460 --> 25:56.400
 For instance, again, it could be TBI, traumatic brain injury,

25:56.400 --> 25:58.920
 it could be seizures or meds or other sorts of drugs.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.880
 Corticosteroids, which are often prescribed

26:00.880 --> 26:03.620
 for a number of immune conditions or for wound healing,

26:03.620 --> 26:05.760
 can also cause manic episodes.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.320
 So they have to determine that everything that's happening

26:09.320 --> 26:10.960
 meets the criteria I described before,

26:10.960 --> 26:13.020
 three out of seven of these symptom categories

26:13.020 --> 26:14.400
 for seven days or more,

26:14.400 --> 26:16.560
 and that it can't be better explained

26:16.560 --> 26:19.200
 by something else going on in that person's life

26:19.200 --> 26:21.320
 or immediate medical history.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.520
 That's very important.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.580
 Now, the other challenge,

26:23.580 --> 26:24.880
 and this is something that's going to come up

26:24.880 --> 26:26.200
 again and again today,

26:26.200 --> 26:28.220
 not just in the description of the biology

26:28.220 --> 26:31.300
 of bipolar disorder, but also in the description

26:31.300 --> 26:33.580
 of different treatments and treatment approaches,

26:33.580 --> 26:36.980
 is that typically when somebody is sitting

26:36.980 --> 26:39.200
 in front of a psychiatrist,

26:39.200 --> 26:41.780
 in particular for the first time,

26:41.780 --> 26:44.020
 those two people are interacting,

26:44.020 --> 26:46.880
 the psychiatrist is just getting one snapshot

26:46.880 --> 26:49.000
 of the person at that moment, right?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.160
 So the person could be on day one of a manic episode,

26:52.160 --> 26:54.680
 the person might be on day six of a manic episode,

26:54.680 --> 26:57.680
 the person could be transitioning out of a manic episode,

26:57.680 --> 26:59.640
 or the person could be suffering

26:59.640 --> 27:01.600
 from a combination of manic episode

27:01.600 --> 27:04.620
 where because of the impulsivity of bipolar disorder,

27:04.620 --> 27:06.040
 they went out and used illicit drugs,

27:06.040 --> 27:07.680
 they also used cocaine.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.860
 So the psychiatrist has a serious challenge.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.500
 The psychiatrist has to determine

27:12.500 --> 27:14.080
 based on a conversation, right?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.880
 This isn't a blood test,

27:15.880 --> 27:18.240
 this isn't a measurement that you can take on a scale

27:18.240 --> 27:19.480
 or with a biomarker,

27:19.480 --> 27:21.140
 they have to use language,

27:21.140 --> 27:23.720
 a conversation with somebody who by all accounts

27:23.720 --> 27:25.720
 is pretty impaired at conversation

27:25.720 --> 27:27.320
 to determine whether or not

27:27.320 --> 27:29.840
 they're suffering from a manic episode

27:29.840 --> 27:33.360
 that is the consequence of bipolar disorder.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.480
 You can imagine this in the real world as somebody says,

27:35.480 --> 27:37.280
 well, how long has it been since you slept?

27:37.280 --> 27:39.360
 And the person starts to answer,

27:39.360 --> 27:41.840
 oh, well, the other day I went down to the basement,

27:41.840 --> 27:44.040
 I was going to get something out of the refrigerator

27:44.040 --> 27:44.880
 and I thought I might take a nap

27:44.880 --> 27:45.720
 and then all of a sudden

27:45.720 --> 27:46.720
 they're talking about something completely different.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.880
 So they might not even have an answer.

27:48.880 --> 27:53.000
 So the psychiatrist has to be a really good detective,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.040
 a benevolent detective, but a detective nonetheless

27:56.040 --> 27:57.160
 in determining whether or not

27:57.160 --> 27:59.200
 these symptoms have existed for seven days or more

27:59.200 --> 28:01.520
 and whether or not they meet at least three,

28:01.520 --> 28:03.680
 it could be more, but at least three of the criteria

28:03.680 --> 28:06.280
 of symptom categories I talked about before.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.240
 Now, assuming that they do,

28:08.240 --> 28:10.760
 assuming that the patient meets those criteria,

28:10.760 --> 28:14.100
 they are likely to be diagnosed with bipolar I.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.880
 Now bipolar I disorder

28:16.880 --> 28:18.660
 means they're having these extended manic episodes,

28:18.660 --> 28:19.840
 seven days or more,

28:19.840 --> 28:23.080
 but it does not necessarily mean that they are dropping

28:23.080 --> 28:25.820
 into a depressive episode as well.

28:25.820 --> 28:28.760
 This is a common misconception about bipolar disorder

28:28.760 --> 28:30.720
 because as it's often called,

28:30.720 --> 28:34.240
 bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar depression

28:34.240 --> 28:36.840
 and yet many people with bipolar disorder

28:36.840 --> 28:40.000
 don't necessarily experience the deep depressive episodes.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.460
 Many of them do, but many of them do not.

28:42.460 --> 28:46.240
 So somebody can truly be diagnosed accurately

28:46.240 --> 28:48.260
 with bipolar I,

28:48.260 --> 28:50.600
 even though they're only experiencing manic episodes

28:50.600 --> 28:52.200
 and then dropping down to baseline.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.320
 Manic episode, then dropping down to baseline.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.880
 That's very important to understand.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.640
 Now, the second category of bipolar disorder is bipolar II.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.200
 So BP2 or bipolar disorder II

29:03.200 --> 29:05.520
 is somewhat different than bipolar disorder I.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.560
 First of all, it's characterized most often

29:08.560 --> 29:11.000
 by the presence of both manic episodes,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.320
 mania and depressive episodes,

29:13.320 --> 29:15.880
 or what's referred to as hypomania.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.960
 Now, anytime in biology or in medicine you hear hypo,

29:19.960 --> 29:22.040
 it's the opposite of hyper, okay?

29:22.040 --> 29:24.180
 So we've got normal, hyper and hypo.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.760
 Hypomania is a somewhat suppressed level of mania.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.600
 So this is not going to be as extreme as the mania

29:30.600 --> 29:32.020
 that we typically think of.

29:32.020 --> 29:36.120
 And yet the hypo can be due to the duration,

29:36.120 --> 29:38.400
 not the intensity of mania.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.240
 That's right.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.000
 Hypomania can mean a lessened intensity of mania,

29:43.000 --> 29:44.680
 but it can also be used

29:44.680 --> 29:47.120
 to refer to a shorter duration of mania.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.440
 In fact, that's one of the key criteria for bipolar II.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.200
 Bipolar II is often diagnosed

29:52.200 --> 29:54.900
 on the basis of the presence of manic episodes

29:54.900 --> 29:58.700
 that are lasting four days or even less.

29:58.700 --> 30:01.080
 So someone with BP2 might have four days

30:01.080 --> 30:03.600
 of this increased energy, goal-directed activity.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.080
 They're irritable, they're euphoric,

30:05.080 --> 30:06.620
 they're not sleeping, et cetera,

30:06.620 --> 30:09.100
 but it's only lasting for about four days.

30:09.100 --> 30:12.520
 Or they could be having longer extended periods of mania,

30:12.520 --> 30:15.240
 but they are hypomanic episodes.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.560
 They're not quite as intense.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.480
 So the pressured speech isn't quite as pressured.

30:19.480 --> 30:22.760
 The impulsivity isn't quite as severe, et cetera, et cetera.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.040
 The other aspect of bipolar II

30:24.040 --> 30:26.480
 is one that I had mentioned briefly a moment ago,

30:26.480 --> 30:28.980
 which is that it's often associated

30:28.980 --> 30:31.440
 with the drops into the depressive episodes.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.560
 So people are going from manic episodes

30:33.560 --> 30:34.860
 for four days or less,

30:34.860 --> 30:36.960
 then they're dropping into a depression,

30:36.960 --> 30:39.640
 going back to normal, manic again.

30:40.780 --> 30:41.840
 I do want to point out, however,

30:41.840 --> 30:43.540
 that people who have bipolar I

30:43.540 --> 30:45.620
 can indeed go from manic episodes

30:45.620 --> 30:47.740
 to severe what we call major depression.

30:47.740 --> 30:50.040
 So they can oscillate like a sine wave,

30:50.040 --> 30:52.220
 really high highs, really low lows.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.840
 And very important to understand

30:55.840 --> 30:59.680
 in terms of understanding both bipolar I and bipolar II

30:59.680 --> 31:01.720
 is that it's not always a sine wave.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.640
 This is really important.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.200
 And it's something that frankly I did not know

31:05.200 --> 31:06.800
 until I started researching this episode

31:06.800 --> 31:08.400
 and talking to some psychiatrists.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.240
 I should mention I've talked

31:09.240 --> 31:11.000
 to several board-certified psychiatrists

31:11.000 --> 31:12.800
 in preparation for this episode.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.280
 I'll give some references to them.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.640
 And in fact, some of them are going to be coming

31:15.640 --> 31:17.520
 on the podcast as guests in the future

31:17.520 --> 31:19.400
 for a more in-depth discussion about bipolar

31:19.400 --> 31:21.620
 and other psychiatric disorders.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.240
 But all of the psychiatrists I spoke to

31:23.240 --> 31:25.680
 confirmed what the other was saying,

31:25.680 --> 31:29.320
 which was that the way that bipolar disorder can present

31:29.320 --> 31:32.040
 can vary tremendously between individuals.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.120
 One person might go from very high highs

31:34.120 --> 31:36.160
 that last seven days or more to very low lows,

31:36.160 --> 31:38.600
 bouts of depression, major depression

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
 that could last two weeks or more.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.200
 Other people are rapid cycling by way of three days manic,

31:44.200 --> 31:45.920
 three days normal, three days manic,

31:45.920 --> 31:48.000
 and then dropping into three days depression.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.480
 So you want to erase that picture in your mind

31:50.480 --> 31:53.480
 that manic bipolar disorder is this sine wave,

31:53.480 --> 31:56.480
 this cycling up and down between mania and depression.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.920
 It can take a lot of different forms.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.160
 And again, this is a serious challenge

32:02.160 --> 32:04.400
 for the psychiatrist to diagnose people

32:04.400 --> 32:06.360
 because of that fact

32:06.360 --> 32:08.360
 that they're only getting a snapshot of the person

32:08.360 --> 32:09.820
 unless they've known them for some time

32:09.820 --> 32:11.680
 and are working with them for some time.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.560
 But this is also especially important for those of you

32:14.560 --> 32:17.720
 that either have bipolar depression

32:17.720 --> 32:18.960
 or suspect that you might,

32:18.960 --> 32:22.640
 or that know someone with bipolar depression

32:22.640 --> 32:26.160
 or suspect somebody might have bipolar depression,

32:26.160 --> 32:27.880
 AKA bipolar disorder.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.960
 Because if you're noticing that somebody

32:29.960 --> 32:32.380
 is very manic and then normal,

32:32.380 --> 32:34.240
 well, that's a very different picture

32:34.240 --> 32:36.040
 than somebody who's going from very manic

32:36.040 --> 32:38.560
 to very deep bouts of depression.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.800
 The very manic to deep bouts of depression

32:40.800 --> 32:42.480
 is easier to recognize

32:42.480 --> 32:44.760
 because of the extremes of those highs and lows.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.960
 Now, this might seem somewhat obvious to all of you

32:46.960 --> 32:47.880
 as I describe it.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.120
 And yet it's very important as a, frankly,

32:51.120 --> 32:54.280
 a citizen of the planet who knows other human beings

32:54.280 --> 32:56.360
 to keep an eye out for these manic episodes

32:56.360 --> 32:59.000
 because again, whether or not it's four days or less

32:59.000 --> 33:01.440
 or whether or not it's seven days or more,

33:01.440 --> 33:05.040
 these manic episodes really are the defining criteria

33:05.040 --> 33:08.000
 of bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar depression.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.600
 There are a couple other key features

33:10.600 --> 33:12.760
 about bipolar I and bipolar II

33:12.760 --> 33:14.560
 that can allow us to get better insight

33:14.560 --> 33:17.240
 into whether or not somebody has bipolar I or bipolar II.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.440
 And that's the percentage of time

33:19.440 --> 33:22.240
 that people with bipolar I versus bipolar II

33:22.240 --> 33:24.980
 spend in a manic state, a depressed state,

33:24.980 --> 33:26.660
 or a symptom-free state.

33:26.660 --> 33:28.080
 And this is also important to discuss

33:28.080 --> 33:31.720
 because it turns out that people with genuine,

33:31.720 --> 33:36.460
 diagnosed bipolar I or bipolar II are often symptom-free,

33:36.460 --> 33:38.620
 which again can make it difficult

33:38.620 --> 33:40.780
 for us as people that know them

33:40.780 --> 33:43.420
 or for people that are treating people

33:43.420 --> 33:46.280
 with bipolar disorder to identify

33:46.280 --> 33:48.700
 whether or not somebody is in a manic episode

33:48.700 --> 33:49.680
 or a depressive episode,

33:49.680 --> 33:50.720
 or whether or not they are headed

33:50.720 --> 33:52.960
 into a manic or depressive episode.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.680
 So the numbers on this have been studied.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.680
 It's from a paper, actually two papers,

33:57.680 --> 34:00.120
 first author Judd, J-U-D-D et al,

34:00.120 --> 34:02.100
 published some years ago, 20 years ago,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.360
 but the data hold up really nicely over time.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.280
 These were both published

34:05.280 --> 34:07.880
 in Journal of American Medical Association Psychiatry.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.360
 So JAMA Psychiatry is a superb journal.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.920
 And basically people who have bipolar I on average

34:13.920 --> 34:17.040
 spend about 50%, it's actually 53%

34:17.040 --> 34:20.420
 was the number that was eventually converged upon,

34:20.420 --> 34:22.840
 but about 50% of their time symptom-free.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.760
 That's interesting, right?

34:23.760 --> 34:27.160
 Somebody who has genuine bipolar I disorder

34:27.160 --> 34:29.920
 can spend as much as half of their life symptom-free,

34:29.920 --> 34:32.400
 sleeping normally, speaking normally, et cetera,

34:32.400 --> 34:36.480
 about 32% of the time depressed.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.520
 And when we say depressed, we mean major depression.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.440
 So severe challenges with waking up

34:41.440 --> 34:43.020
 at two or three in the morning

34:43.020 --> 34:44.520
 and having trouble falling back asleep,

34:44.520 --> 34:46.520
 that's one of the defining characteristics of depression

34:46.520 --> 34:47.760
 or sleeping far too much,

34:47.760 --> 34:49.280
 having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning,

34:49.280 --> 34:51.000
 suppressed appetite, suppressed libido,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.640
 suppressed motivation, all the general symptoms

34:53.640 --> 34:54.480
 of major depression,

34:54.480 --> 34:56.240
 which we'll talk about a little bit more later

34:56.240 --> 34:57.800
 and in an upcoming episode

34:57.800 --> 34:59.680
 about major depression in particular.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.940
 And then about 15% of their time

35:01.940 --> 35:04.840
 in this kind of manic state or mixed manic state

35:04.840 --> 35:07.640
 where they are showing long,

35:07.640 --> 35:09.960
 again, seven days or more bouts of sleeplessness,

35:09.960 --> 35:12.820
 irritability, pressured speech, grandiosity, et cetera.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.760
 Contrast that with people who have bipolar II disorder

35:16.760 --> 35:20.000
 who are spending about half of their time

35:20.000 --> 35:21.780
 in a depressed state.

35:21.780 --> 35:22.860
 So that's interesting.

35:22.860 --> 35:24.440
 People with bipolar II disorder,

35:24.440 --> 35:27.280
 while not always displaying depressed states

35:27.280 --> 35:29.960
 or oscillations between mania or hypomania

35:29.960 --> 35:31.120
 and depressed states,

35:31.120 --> 35:33.640
 they tend to be in a depressed state more often.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.960
 And again, this is major depression.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.460
 This isn't just a little bit of a low.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.300
 This is a serious depression of their nervous system,

35:39.300 --> 35:41.720
 their mood, and as we say, their affect,

35:41.720 --> 35:42.840
 their outlook on life.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.200
 And that's one of the key distinguishing features

35:45.200 --> 35:48.560
 of major depression is that people's outlook on life

35:48.560 --> 35:50.920
 becomes very diminished in the sense

35:50.920 --> 35:52.120
 that they don't see a future.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.540
 You ask them about, you know, how's work going?

35:54.540 --> 35:55.380
 How are relationships?

35:55.380 --> 35:58.280
 And it's not just that they feel that that's going poorly.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.240
 They really feel as if there's no opportunity

36:00.240 --> 36:01.700
 for those things to improve.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.960
 Those people with bipolar II tend to be symptom-free

36:05.960 --> 36:07.520
 about 45% of the time.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.360
 Again, these are averages.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.360
 So about 45% of the time.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.340
 That's a considerable amount of the time.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.820
 And they tend to be in these hypomanic states

36:15.820 --> 36:18.240
 only about four or 5% of the time.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.740
 Again, the criteria for BP2, bipolar II,

36:20.740 --> 36:24.320
 is these four days or less of mania or hypomania.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.420
 But only 4% of the time or 5% of the time

36:27.420 --> 36:30.760
 is a small enough sliver of the pie

36:30.760 --> 36:32.800
 that is these people's existence

36:32.800 --> 36:36.200
 that you can imagine why it would be easy

36:36.200 --> 36:38.800
 for them or other people to overlook the fact

36:38.800 --> 36:41.600
 that they have bipolar disorder and not major depression.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.440
 Think about it.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.440
 This is a person who, or I should say a collection of people

36:45.440 --> 36:48.240
 who are spending about half of their time depressed,

36:48.240 --> 36:52.480
 close to half, 45% of their time symptom-free,

36:52.480 --> 36:56.120
 and then about 5% of their time in a hypomanic state.

36:56.120 --> 37:00.680
 So either shortened bouts of high intensity mania

37:00.680 --> 37:04.480
 or hypomania that is of reduced intensity.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.020
 One of the reasons that I mentioned these percentages

37:07.020 --> 37:09.280
 of time spent in a symptom-free depressed manic

37:09.280 --> 37:11.320
 or hypomanic state is because one of my major goals

37:11.320 --> 37:14.840
 for today's episode is that it will increase awareness

37:14.840 --> 37:17.840
 of whether or not you or somebody you know,

37:17.840 --> 37:19.960
 could be a coworker, could be a family member, et cetera,

37:19.960 --> 37:22.680
 might be suffering from bipolar I or bipolar II.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.560
 I think it's fair to say that if somebody is suffering

37:24.560 --> 37:29.160
 from bipolar I, that is likely to be revealed

37:29.160 --> 37:32.340
 or to reveal itself before too long

37:32.340 --> 37:35.100
 because of the fact that people have these extended periods

37:35.100 --> 37:37.360
 of mania and mania is such an extreme state,

37:37.360 --> 37:39.480
 not just for the person who's experiencing it,

37:39.480 --> 37:41.680
 but the way that it presents is just so extreme

37:41.680 --> 37:43.540
 and out of the ordinary.

37:43.540 --> 37:45.560
 But bipolar II, you can imagine,

37:45.560 --> 37:48.880
 could really duck under the radar of our awareness.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.800
 And you could imagine that we might just think

37:50.800 --> 37:52.220
 somebody is low or depressed,

37:52.220 --> 37:54.520
 especially if that person tends to self-medicate

37:54.520 --> 37:56.440
 with alcohol or other substances.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.520
 We might think, oh, well, they're drinking more than often,

37:58.520 --> 37:59.760
 more than usual, excuse me,

37:59.760 --> 38:02.560
 or they're spending more time alone and isolating.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.200
 But then when they're in their hypomanic state,

38:04.200 --> 38:06.680
 that might actually present as normal to us

38:06.680 --> 38:09.400
 because they were in such a depressed state before.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.960
 So it's very important that we dial up our awareness,

38:11.960 --> 38:14.260
 that we can tune our antennae to the possibility

38:14.260 --> 38:16.360
 that people out there who might appear depressed

38:16.360 --> 38:17.880
 or that we haven't heard from in a while

38:17.880 --> 38:20.600
 might actually be suffering from bipolar II disorder.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.960
 Before we move into a in-depth discussion

38:22.960 --> 38:24.340
 about the different kinds of treatments

38:24.340 --> 38:25.940
 for bipolar disorder,

38:25.940 --> 38:28.600
 I'd like to touch on just a few additional aspects

38:28.600 --> 38:31.060
 of what bipolar disorder can do

38:31.060 --> 38:32.720
 in terms of its negative consequences

38:32.720 --> 38:35.320
 and also talk about some of the inherited risk,

38:35.320 --> 38:38.480
 that is the genetic factors and the environmental factors

38:38.480 --> 38:40.620
 that can contribute to bipolar disorder.

38:40.620 --> 38:43.280
 In terms of the burden,

38:43.280 --> 38:46.480
 the very real emotional and occupational

38:46.480 --> 38:47.880
 and educational burden

38:47.880 --> 38:50.680
 that can occur for somebody with bipolar disorder,

38:50.680 --> 38:51.680
 that's actually been studied.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.960
 There's a measure of this, it's called global burden,

38:53.960 --> 38:56.840
 which is defined as the years lost

38:56.840 --> 39:00.340
 in engaging in normal life due to some disability.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.280
 So that disability could be cancer,

39:02.280 --> 39:05.080
 that disability in this case is bipolar disorder.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.900
 And basically the way this sort of study is done

39:07.900 --> 39:09.200
 is that through questionnaires,

39:09.200 --> 39:11.600
 I should say quite in-depth questionnaires,

39:11.600 --> 39:13.980
 there's a probing for whether or not somebody

39:13.980 --> 39:17.600
 has lost two consecutive weeks or more

39:17.600 --> 39:19.480
 of interest in normal activities.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.040
 Now, for people who have depression,

39:21.040 --> 39:23.560
 that's a kind of straightforward thing to address, right?

39:23.560 --> 39:25.900
 You ask somebody, when was the last time you ate?

39:25.900 --> 39:27.760
 Or when was the last time that you went a few days

39:27.760 --> 39:31.200
 without food or lost interest in relationships

39:31.200 --> 39:32.880
 or work or sex or things of that sort?

39:32.880 --> 39:34.880
 And they answer and you can figure out

39:34.880 --> 39:37.720
 the amount of time that you've essentially been withdrawn

39:37.720 --> 39:40.460
 from normal levels of activity for them.

39:41.740 --> 39:44.240
 With bipolar disorder, what it turns out

39:44.240 --> 39:47.760
 is that the global burden of having bipolar I

39:47.760 --> 39:50.160
 and even bipolar II is massive.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.340
 In fact, having bipolar disorder sits

39:53.340 --> 39:56.080
 as one of the highest risk factors

39:56.080 --> 40:00.920
 for being in the top 10 of all categories of disabilities

40:00.920 --> 40:02.120
 leading to global burden.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.360
 Put in plain English, what that means is having bipolar I

40:05.360 --> 40:08.520
 or bipolar II disorder is extremely debilitating.

40:08.520 --> 40:12.220
 It really slows down one's life trajectory

40:12.220 --> 40:14.160
 unless it's treated properly.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.360
 Now, the other aspect of bipolar disorder

40:16.360 --> 40:17.640
 is its heritability.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.720
 And this gets into a little bit of some tricky science

40:20.720 --> 40:25.720
 related to heritability versus the genetic contribution

40:26.160 --> 40:28.040
 of a given disease.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.020
 So that might sound like the same thing.

40:30.020 --> 40:32.320
 You think, okay, genes relate to heritability,

40:32.320 --> 40:33.720
 heritability relates to genes,

40:33.720 --> 40:36.560
 but of course everything about the way

40:36.560 --> 40:38.660
 that our nervous system works and functions

40:38.660 --> 40:41.360
 and expresses itself, healthy or otherwise,

40:41.360 --> 40:45.080
 is an interaction between our genes and our environment.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.080
 And so typically the way these studies are done

40:47.080 --> 40:50.460
 is you address what is the risk of somebody

40:50.460 --> 40:52.740
 having a given condition in the general population?

40:52.740 --> 40:53.700
 We talked about that before.

40:53.700 --> 40:57.160
 Bipolar disorder is a 1% of the world's population.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.040
 Compare that to people who have only major depression.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.520
 So this would be repeated bouts of two weeks or more

41:03.520 --> 41:06.160
 of serious depression, not just low mood

41:06.160 --> 41:09.860
 or something due to a life loss, but major depression,

41:09.860 --> 41:13.660
 which is 10 to 17% of people have major depression.

41:13.660 --> 41:17.120
 Okay, they suffer from major depressive disorder

41:17.120 --> 41:19.780
 compared to bipolar disorder, which again is 1%.

41:19.780 --> 41:24.780
 Now you can address how much of the 1% of bipolar disorder

41:24.940 --> 41:28.460
 that exists is due to genes versus environment

41:28.460 --> 41:30.220
 in a somewhat exact way.

41:30.220 --> 41:31.760
 This is never an exact science.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.340
 And the way that this is typically done

41:33.340 --> 41:37.740
 is to look at concordance, that is the likelihood

41:37.740 --> 41:42.380
 that two identical twins will both have a given condition

41:42.380 --> 41:44.200
 as opposed to two fraternal twins,

41:44.200 --> 41:46.880
 which have more different genes

41:46.880 --> 41:48.220
 than identical twins, of course.

41:48.220 --> 41:51.220
 And then two siblings who have similar genes, of course,

41:51.220 --> 41:54.420
 but less similar than identical or fraternal twins

41:54.420 --> 41:55.480
 and so on and so forth.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.900
 So what you basically do is you evaluate the probability

41:57.900 --> 41:59.540
 that two people in the general population

41:59.540 --> 42:02.780
 who are completely unrelated will have the same condition

42:02.780 --> 42:05.540
 versus two people in the general population

42:05.540 --> 42:07.340
 who are very related identical twins.

42:07.340 --> 42:10.900
 And what you find is that in identical twins,

42:10.900 --> 42:14.800
 if one identical twin has true major depression

42:14.800 --> 42:16.640
 or major depressive disorder,

42:16.640 --> 42:21.300
 there's a 20 to 45% chance that their identical twin

42:21.300 --> 42:23.660
 will also have major depressive disorder.

42:23.660 --> 42:27.360
 Now that tells you right there that it can't all be genes.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.660
 That is not a gene for major depression per se,

42:29.660 --> 42:33.340
 or if it is a gene or a collection of genes,

42:33.340 --> 42:35.860
 that those genes are also subject to environmental

42:35.860 --> 42:37.900
 influences, either prenatal within the womb

42:37.900 --> 42:40.140
 or after children are born.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.500
 Now, the large range there of 20 to 45%

42:42.500 --> 42:44.420
 could be due to any number of things.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.140
 It could be experimental,

42:46.140 --> 42:48.020
 meaning the techniques that were used in experiments.

42:48.020 --> 42:51.540
 It could be due to regional differences, right?

42:51.540 --> 42:52.780
 One part of the world versus another.

42:52.780 --> 42:54.480
 There are a lot of different factors.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.760
 Right now, we probably shouldn't delve into all that.

42:56.760 --> 42:58.180
 At some point, we'll probably do an episode

42:58.180 --> 43:01.740
 all about the genetics of nervous system heritability

43:01.740 --> 43:04.580
 and heritability of features and mental health, et cetera.

43:04.580 --> 43:07.980
 But we can compare major depression and the heritability

43:07.980 --> 43:10.780
 or the genetic concordance between identical twins

43:10.780 --> 43:13.120
 in major depression and bipolar disorder and ask,

43:13.120 --> 43:16.860
 if one twin of an identical twin pair

43:16.860 --> 43:18.820
 has bipolar depression,

43:19.780 --> 43:22.300
 what is the likelihood that the other twin will have it?

43:22.300 --> 43:25.700
 And it turns out that number is much higher.

43:25.700 --> 43:29.000
 It's 40 to 70% likelihood or probability

43:29.000 --> 43:32.800
 that if one twin has bipolar disorder,

43:32.800 --> 43:35.580
 that their identical twin will also have bipolar disorder.

43:35.580 --> 43:39.420
 So again, the total incidence of bipolar disorder

43:39.420 --> 43:42.520
 in the general population is much lower

43:42.520 --> 43:43.780
 than it is for major depression.

43:43.780 --> 43:48.140
 It's 1% for bipolar versus 10 to 17% for major depression.

43:48.140 --> 43:51.260
 But the genetic component is much higher,

43:51.260 --> 43:55.860
 40 to 70% for bipolar disorder versus 20 to 45%

43:55.860 --> 43:56.860
 for major depression.

43:56.860 --> 44:00.260
 I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there,

44:00.260 --> 44:03.580
 but basically what this means is that researchers

44:03.580 --> 44:05.540
 have been able to take those numbers

44:05.540 --> 44:08.820
 and filter them through a number of different risk factors

44:08.820 --> 44:10.900
 that are related to early development,

44:10.900 --> 44:13.700
 ask questions like if two twins were raised separately

44:13.700 --> 44:16.340
 or together in one part of the world versus another,

44:16.340 --> 44:19.140
 or had a two-parent household versus one-parent household,

44:19.140 --> 44:21.200
 evaluate a lot of different variables.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.100
 What they were able to discover,

44:23.100 --> 44:25.100
 and this has been shown again and again,

44:25.100 --> 44:30.100
 is that the genetic contribution to bipolar disorder

44:30.140 --> 44:32.020
 is very, very high.

44:32.020 --> 44:37.020
 That is the heritability of bipolar disorder is 85%.

44:37.660 --> 44:40.880
 Okay, so again, I want to be really clear what this means.

44:41.740 --> 44:46.020
 The total occurrence in the general population, fairly low.

44:46.020 --> 44:49.020
 Still serious, 1%, but fairly low

44:49.020 --> 44:51.100
 compared to other things like major depression.

44:51.100 --> 44:55.100
 However, if someone has bipolar disorder,

44:55.100 --> 44:58.500
 it's very likely that they inherited some gene

44:58.500 --> 45:02.780
 or sets of genes or more accurately a susceptibility

45:02.780 --> 45:05.740
 within their genes to environmental influences

45:05.740 --> 45:08.240
 that can trigger bipolar disorder.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.420
 There are a lot of different ways to discuss

45:10.420 --> 45:12.340
 and to conceptualize heritability.

45:12.340 --> 45:13.460
 So I want to be very careful

45:13.460 --> 45:15.380
 with the way that I'm wording this.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.540
 What this means is that people with bipolar disorder

45:18.540 --> 45:21.540
 very likely have a gene or more typically

45:21.540 --> 45:24.680
 it's going to be a set of genes that creates a susceptibility

45:24.680 --> 45:27.520
 for bipolar disorder to present itself.

45:27.520 --> 45:30.380
 Now, what environmental factors trigger

45:30.380 --> 45:34.480
 or increase that susceptibility is not entirely clear.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.220
 This always seems to center back onto the same sets of things

45:37.220 --> 45:40.020
 like early life stress, trauma, et cetera.

45:40.020 --> 45:42.660
 Certainly those are going to exacerbate the likelihood

45:42.660 --> 45:44.660
 that someone who has a genetic propensity

45:44.660 --> 45:47.900
 for bipolar disorder will express that bipolar disorder

45:47.900 --> 45:50.300
 in its full array of symptomology,

45:50.300 --> 45:55.300
 but 85% while very, very high is not 100%.

45:55.940 --> 45:59.060
 Again, 85%, while a very high number for heritability

45:59.060 --> 46:00.180
 is not 100%.

46:00.180 --> 46:03.600
 What that means is that there is no single gene

46:03.600 --> 46:07.260
 or identified gene cluster for bipolar disorder.

46:07.260 --> 46:09.260
 The reason I keep drilling into this over and over

46:09.260 --> 46:11.260
 is that I think we can confidently say

46:11.260 --> 46:12.800
 that if someone has bipolar disorder,

46:12.800 --> 46:15.160
 that there was something in their genetic lineage

46:15.160 --> 46:18.220
 that led to that, or that very likely led to that.

46:18.220 --> 46:22.380
 And yet it's not like eye color

46:22.380 --> 46:24.620
 or some other physical feature

46:24.620 --> 46:27.300
 which we can actually do the direct,

46:27.300 --> 46:28.700
 so it's called Mendelian genetics

46:28.700 --> 46:32.540
 and figure out whether or not somebody directly inherited

46:32.540 --> 46:34.420
 that gene from one parent or the other parent.

46:34.420 --> 46:36.980
 So the takeaway here is that

46:36.980 --> 46:39.140
 if you have certainly an identical twin

46:39.140 --> 46:41.460
 or a fraternal twin or a sibling or a parent

46:41.460 --> 46:44.640
 or even a cousin or an uncle that has bipolar disorder

46:44.640 --> 46:46.900
 in particular bipolar one,

46:46.900 --> 46:49.340
 well then you need to be on the lookout

46:49.340 --> 46:51.840
 for bipolar disorder perhaps in yourself

46:51.840 --> 46:53.840
 and for the family members of that person.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.340
 My goal within this episode up until now

46:56.340 --> 46:59.700
 has been to provide a clear and detailed picture

46:59.700 --> 47:03.040
 of bipolar disorder and its various forms.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.780
 Before we start to talk about treatments

47:04.780 --> 47:05.780
 for bipolar disorder

47:05.780 --> 47:09.460
 and some of the neural circuit basis for bipolar disorder,

47:09.460 --> 47:12.180
 I want to make sure that I distinguish bipolar disorder

47:12.180 --> 47:15.260
 from borderline personality disorder.

47:15.260 --> 47:16.740
 We will do an entire episode

47:16.740 --> 47:18.160
 or maybe even several episodes

47:18.160 --> 47:20.520
 about borderline personality disorder.

47:20.520 --> 47:25.020
 Borderline personality disorder can indeed present itself

47:25.020 --> 47:29.500
 in ways that resemble bipolar disorder and vice versa,

47:29.500 --> 47:32.340
 but there are some key distinctions that need to be made

47:32.340 --> 47:34.460
 because it turns out that bipolar disorder

47:34.460 --> 47:38.240
 and borderline personality disorder are quite distinct

47:38.240 --> 47:40.120
 in terms of their defining criteria.

47:40.120 --> 47:42.820
 The key distinction between somebody

47:42.820 --> 47:47.220
 with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder

47:47.220 --> 47:50.340
 is that in borderline personality disorder,

47:50.340 --> 47:54.360
 there can be episodes that can resemble mania or hypomania.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.540
 So periods of flights of ideas

47:56.540 --> 47:59.080
 or where people are spending money excessively

47:59.080 --> 48:02.400
 or sexually promiscuous in ways that seem manic

48:02.400 --> 48:05.960
 or could even be a little bit manic or a lot manic.

48:05.960 --> 48:08.280
 And yet more often than not,

48:08.280 --> 48:12.280
 there is an environmental trigger for those manic episodes.

48:12.280 --> 48:16.000
 That is distinctly different from bipolar disorder

48:16.000 --> 48:18.320
 where the person will have manic episodes

48:18.320 --> 48:20.340
 without any need for a trigger.

48:20.340 --> 48:23.360
 There doesn't need to be a call from someone saying,

48:23.360 --> 48:25.280
 hey, let's go on a vacation together

48:25.280 --> 48:27.480
 or there's something coming up this Friday

48:27.480 --> 48:28.760
 that's really exciting

48:28.760 --> 48:31.160
 or let's enter a relationship together

48:31.160 --> 48:32.400
 of one form or another.

48:32.400 --> 48:35.440
 The person with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania

48:35.440 --> 48:37.600
 or episodes of major depression

48:37.600 --> 48:40.480
 without any need for an external stimulus

48:40.480 --> 48:42.160
 or environmental trigger.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.960
 But the person with borderline personality disorder

48:44.960 --> 48:46.240
 almost always, again,

48:46.240 --> 48:48.460
 there's never an always in biology and psychiatry,

48:48.460 --> 48:53.040
 but almost always is going to exhibit flights of mania

48:53.040 --> 48:55.800
 or depressive episodes or other types of mood shifts

48:55.800 --> 48:59.360
 that are dramatic and maladaptive in response to things

48:59.360 --> 49:02.280
 that are coming in through the external environment

49:02.280 --> 49:03.840
 or relationships of some kind.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.720
 In fact, one of the defining characteristics

49:05.720 --> 49:07.840
 of borderline personality disorder

49:07.840 --> 49:10.080
 is this thing that's referred to as splitting.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.420
 A good example of splitting

49:11.420 --> 49:14.120
 in the person with borderline personality disorder

49:14.120 --> 49:17.820
 is that they will feel that they absolutely adore you

49:17.820 --> 49:19.640
 and want to spend all their time with you

49:19.640 --> 49:22.240
 and just think the world of you, you can do no wrong.

49:22.240 --> 49:25.380
 And in fact, they genuinely can feel that way

49:25.380 --> 49:27.760
 and can genuinely think that way about you.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.020
 And then for whatever reason,

49:30.020 --> 49:32.880
 it could be a perception of something that you did

49:32.880 --> 49:34.280
 or something that you said

49:34.280 --> 49:37.120
 or suspicion that you're thinking something about them,

49:37.120 --> 49:41.200
 they can suddenly shift or split their emotions

49:41.200 --> 49:45.040
 and what's called move you from a good object

49:45.040 --> 49:48.240
 or a can do no wrong object to a bad object.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.760
 They'll suddenly decide that you are cheating on them

49:50.760 --> 49:53.220
 or that you are being mean to them

49:53.220 --> 49:54.520
 or that you're insulting them

49:54.520 --> 49:56.720
 or that something that you're doing

49:56.720 --> 49:59.560
 is in violation to their self-worth,

49:59.560 --> 50:00.640
 their wellbeing, et cetera.

50:00.640 --> 50:02.560
 And that can send them down a pathway

50:02.560 --> 50:04.960
 of being very angry, very depressed, et cetera.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.800
 As I described the contour of a person

50:06.800 --> 50:08.760
 with borderline personality disorder

50:08.760 --> 50:11.020
 as somebody who splits very suddenly

50:11.020 --> 50:12.680
 in response to some environmental trigger,

50:12.680 --> 50:16.160
 real or perceived, there's the risk, of course,

50:16.160 --> 50:18.860
 that it makes the person with borderline personality disorder

50:18.860 --> 50:22.080
 sound like a bad person, that they're very volatile.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.800
 And while they can be volatile,

50:23.800 --> 50:25.400
 I want to be very careful to point out

50:25.400 --> 50:27.640
 that the person with borderline personality disorder

50:27.640 --> 50:30.280
 is also suffering in this context.

50:30.280 --> 50:33.200
 So while those sorts of relationships

50:33.200 --> 50:35.800
 with people with borderline personality disorder,

50:35.800 --> 50:37.620
 whether or not they're romantic relationships

50:37.620 --> 50:39.680
 or familial or coworkers, et cetera,

50:39.680 --> 50:42.040
 can be very challenged, can be very high friction

50:42.040 --> 50:46.480
 because of the good object, bad object shifts, et cetera,

50:46.480 --> 50:48.380
 it's bi-directional, meaning the person

50:48.380 --> 50:50.720
 with borderline personality disorder, as you can imagine,

50:50.720 --> 50:52.320
 is also going through a lot of suffering.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.880
 At one moment, they feel as if someone is wonderful

50:54.880 --> 50:55.920
 and can do no wrong to them

50:55.920 --> 50:57.960
 and they want to be so strongly affiliated with them.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.240
 And then in the next moment,

50:59.240 --> 51:01.400
 they feel as if that person is attacking them

51:01.400 --> 51:04.040
 through their actions or even through their non-actions.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.640
 So again, we will return

51:05.640 --> 51:08.540
 to borderline personality disorder in a separate episode.

51:08.540 --> 51:11.200
 It's a serious disorder, both for the person that has it

51:11.200 --> 51:12.620
 and for people around them.

51:12.620 --> 51:14.480
 Fortunately, there are some emerging treatments

51:14.480 --> 51:16.200
 that are showing promise,

51:16.200 --> 51:18.540
 and it's a fairly common disorder,

51:18.540 --> 51:20.600
 but it's important that we distinguish

51:20.600 --> 51:23.840
 borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder,

51:23.840 --> 51:25.980
 mostly on the basis of this need for a trigger.

51:25.980 --> 51:28.200
 Again, in bipolar disorder,

51:28.200 --> 51:31.160
 there is no need for a trigger to create a manic episode

51:31.160 --> 51:32.480
 or a major depressive episode.

51:32.480 --> 51:35.680
 They just happen, or they can just happen.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.320
 Whereas in borderline personality disorder,

51:38.320 --> 51:40.560
 almost always there's an external trigger

51:40.560 --> 51:43.720
 or a perception that something happened in the environment

51:43.720 --> 51:45.940
 or that somebody is behaving a certain way

51:45.940 --> 51:47.560
 that dramatically shifts the person

51:47.560 --> 51:49.600
 with borderline personality disorder

51:49.600 --> 51:51.500
 from one mode to the next.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.800
 As we move into our discussion about the treatments for

51:53.800 --> 51:56.560
 and neural circuits underlying bipolar disorder,

51:56.560 --> 51:59.960
 I want to just nail down one more key point.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.480
 This is a very brief point,

52:01.480 --> 52:03.960
 but it's perhaps the most important point,

52:03.960 --> 52:07.120
 which is the highs and lows,

52:07.120 --> 52:09.160
 or we should say the highs,

52:09.160 --> 52:11.480
 these manic episodes and sometimes lows,

52:11.480 --> 52:14.140
 because again, not everybody with bipolar disorder one or two

52:14.140 --> 52:15.900
 suffers from depressive episodes.

52:15.900 --> 52:17.600
 Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.840
 In particular in bipolar II, yes,

52:19.840 --> 52:22.760
 but people with bipolar I can have extreme manic episodes

52:22.760 --> 52:25.040
 and then just return to normal, as you recall.

52:25.040 --> 52:28.460
 Well, those extreme lows and or extreme highs

52:28.460 --> 52:30.520
 of people with bipolar disorder

52:30.520 --> 52:34.000
 impact their lives in very negative ways.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.320
 This is essential.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.040
 And it's something that we're going to return to

52:37.040 --> 52:39.020
 a little bit later when we talk about the relationship

52:39.020 --> 52:41.600
 between bipolar disorder and creativity,

52:41.600 --> 52:42.800
 because it turns out that there's

52:42.800 --> 52:45.480
 a quite strong association there,

52:45.480 --> 52:47.200
 one that would almost lead you to believe

52:47.200 --> 52:49.640
 that being bipolar can be beneficial in certain contexts.

52:49.640 --> 52:54.220
 And yet on whole, having bipolar disorder

52:54.220 --> 52:56.120
 is extremely detrimental

52:56.120 --> 52:58.320
 and challenging to the person suffering from it.

52:58.320 --> 52:59.960
 And it's something that we want to keep in mind

52:59.960 --> 53:03.440
 as we think about treatments and the underlying biology.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.240
 Now I'd like to talk about some of the treatments

53:05.240 --> 53:06.920
 for bipolar disorder.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.880
 And in the discussion of those treatments,

53:08.880 --> 53:11.820
 there's an absolutely incredible history

53:11.820 --> 53:14.280
 of the discovery of one particular treatment

53:14.280 --> 53:18.120
 that still shows great success in many patients,

53:18.120 --> 53:19.780
 although some people can't take it

53:19.780 --> 53:21.560
 for reasons that we'll talk about.

53:21.560 --> 53:24.680
 And in the description of the discovery of this treatment

53:24.680 --> 53:26.280
 for bipolar disorder,

53:26.280 --> 53:29.080
 it also reveals to us that sometimes

53:29.080 --> 53:32.800
 treatments come to the profession of medicine

53:32.800 --> 53:36.620
 and through science in ways that precede

53:36.620 --> 53:39.520
 the discovery of the underlying biology.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.360
 That's right.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.620
 Every once in a while,

53:41.620 --> 53:44.400
 someone will discover a treatment for a disease

53:44.400 --> 53:46.300
 without any understanding

53:46.300 --> 53:49.940
 about the underlying biological basis of that disease.

53:49.940 --> 53:52.800
 And in fact, that is the case for bipolar disorder.

53:52.800 --> 53:56.600
 And the treatment that we're referring to is lithium.

53:56.600 --> 53:59.020
 Lithium, as some of you know,

53:59.020 --> 54:01.480
 is on the periodic table of elements.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.400
 It is indeed a naturally occurring substance.

54:04.400 --> 54:08.240
 It actually arrived on earth by way of stardust.

54:08.240 --> 54:11.040
 Yes, we are talking about stardust on this podcast.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.000
 But if you'd like to learn more

54:12.000 --> 54:13.520
 about the origins of lithium

54:13.520 --> 54:15.780
 and how lithium arrived here on earth

54:15.780 --> 54:18.960
 for its discovery and applications in psychiatry,

54:18.960 --> 54:21.640
 there's a beautiful talk that exists on YouTube.

54:21.640 --> 54:24.720
 And we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions

54:24.720 --> 54:27.480
 that describes the history of lithium

54:27.480 --> 54:29.920
 in terms of its interplanetary travels

54:29.920 --> 54:31.280
 and arrival on earth.

54:31.280 --> 54:34.120
 This is a talk delivered by a physicist

54:34.120 --> 54:36.400
 who's expert in quantum mechanics

54:36.400 --> 54:38.280
 and is expert in lithium.

54:38.280 --> 54:40.720
 And it's a just wonderful talk that I can refer you to.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.380
 Less on the biology in that talk,

54:42.380 --> 54:44.380
 but certainly a lot about lithium as an element.

54:44.380 --> 54:46.840
 So for those of you nerds like me

54:46.840 --> 54:50.820
 that love to know how things came to be here on the planet

54:50.820 --> 54:52.360
 in one form or another,

54:52.360 --> 54:55.280
 I'll encourage you to take a brief listen to that talk.

54:55.280 --> 54:56.600
 We are going to discuss lithium

54:56.600 --> 54:58.620
 in the context of its applications

54:58.620 --> 55:00.520
 for treatment of bipolar disorder.

55:00.520 --> 55:01.820
 And the discovery of lithium

55:01.820 --> 55:04.160
 as a treatment for bipolar disorder

55:04.160 --> 55:05.940
 is truly a miraculous story

55:05.940 --> 55:07.540
 that I think everyone should know.

55:07.540 --> 55:11.400
 The key player in this story is a physician

55:11.400 --> 55:12.560
 by the last name Cade.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.880
 He was an Australian physician.

55:14.880 --> 55:18.200
 And Cade has a very interesting story in his own right.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.080
 Cade was an Australian psychiatrist

55:20.080 --> 55:24.800
 or Australian psychiatrist who also was a soldier.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.280
 And during World War II,

55:27.280 --> 55:29.120
 after the fall of Singapore to Japan,

55:29.120 --> 55:31.340
 he became a prisoner of war

55:31.340 --> 55:35.560
 and he was a prisoner of war from 1942 until 1945.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.800
 So he had some time for observation.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.440
 And during his imprisonment,

55:39.440 --> 55:41.740
 he observed some of his fellow inmates

55:41.740 --> 55:44.600
 as going through pretty wild vacillations

55:44.600 --> 55:46.240
 in mood and energy,

55:46.240 --> 55:49.520
 essentially going from manic episodes to depressed episodes

55:49.520 --> 55:51.820
 or from manic to normal episodes.

55:51.820 --> 55:54.880
 And for one reason or another,

55:54.880 --> 55:55.800
 we don't know why,

55:55.800 --> 55:57.080
 because I couldn't find any report

55:57.080 --> 55:59.040
 as to why he hypothesized this,

55:59.040 --> 56:01.600
 but he hypothesized that there was some buildup

56:01.600 --> 56:05.400
 of some chemical in these people's brains

56:05.400 --> 56:08.000
 that then they would urinate out

56:08.000 --> 56:12.520
 and that urinating out of whatever chemical was in there

56:12.520 --> 56:15.600
 would allow them to be more relaxed and not manic.

56:15.600 --> 56:16.820
 In other words,

56:16.820 --> 56:19.240
 Cade hypothesized that there's a buildup of a chemical

56:19.240 --> 56:21.240
 in certain people's brains that makes them manic

56:21.240 --> 56:23.620
 and they urinate that chemical out.

56:23.620 --> 56:27.120
 So eventually he got out of this prison,

56:27.120 --> 56:29.040
 as we mentioned, in 1945,

56:29.040 --> 56:30.960
 and he started doing experiments

56:30.960 --> 56:33.860
 in addition to seeing patients in his clinic.

56:33.860 --> 56:36.060
 And what he did is he started to take urine

56:36.060 --> 56:38.280
 from people who exhibited mania

56:38.280 --> 56:41.000
 and urine from people who were not manic.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.240
 And he took that urine

56:42.240 --> 56:44.400
 and he would inject it into guinea pigs

56:44.400 --> 56:46.440
 as an experimental model.

56:46.440 --> 56:49.000
 And his general observation

56:49.000 --> 56:51.480
 was that there was something in the urine

56:51.480 --> 56:55.160
 that was indeed making the guinea pigs more manic

56:55.160 --> 56:59.680
 if they were injected with urine from a manic patient.

56:59.680 --> 57:02.260
 The exact measures that he was taking in these guinea pigs

57:02.260 --> 57:03.280
 wasn't exactly clear.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.180
 This is at a time or an era in science

57:06.180 --> 57:08.260
 when you could just sort of report things

57:08.260 --> 57:09.720
 a little bit more subjectively.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.240
 Although there were still numbers and statistics,

57:12.240 --> 57:14.560
 it was a little bit more of like case studies

57:14.560 --> 57:15.600
 and descriptions,

57:15.600 --> 57:16.960
 but it turns out that even though

57:16.960 --> 57:18.280
 that all seems a little bit loose,

57:18.280 --> 57:21.940
 it led to some incredible and still important discoveries

57:21.940 --> 57:23.680
 for psychiatric health.

57:23.680 --> 57:25.460
 So what he figured out

57:25.460 --> 57:27.080
 was that the urine from manic patients

57:27.080 --> 57:29.840
 seemed to be more toxic for these guinea pigs.

57:29.840 --> 57:33.420
 And he also knew that there are two toxic substances

57:33.420 --> 57:36.800
 in urine, urea and uric acid.

57:36.800 --> 57:40.160
 So he was able to separate the urea and uric acid

57:40.160 --> 57:44.580
 from people with mania and patients that did not have mania.

57:44.580 --> 57:47.800
 And he figured out that the urea was the same

57:47.800 --> 57:50.840
 in both these mentally ill manic patients

57:50.840 --> 57:52.640
 and the non-manic patients.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.200
 So it did not seem that urea was the compound

57:56.200 --> 57:58.680
 that was creating these manic episodes

57:58.680 --> 58:02.840
 or related to manic episodes or held the toxicity.

58:02.840 --> 58:05.800
 So instead he focused on the uric acid.

58:05.800 --> 58:09.520
 Now, in order to put the uric acid into solution

58:09.520 --> 58:11.760
 so that he could inject it into these guinea pigs,

58:11.760 --> 58:13.920
 he had to try a number of different compounds

58:13.920 --> 58:14.820
 in order to dilute it.

58:14.820 --> 58:16.460
 It just so happens that,

58:16.460 --> 58:18.200
 and you chemists will be familiar with this,

58:18.200 --> 58:19.540
 but there's certain things

58:19.540 --> 58:21.180
 that just don't go into solution easily.

58:21.180 --> 58:23.140
 You put the powder in a vial,

58:23.140 --> 58:25.440
 you add some water or a saline or another solution,

58:25.440 --> 58:27.800
 you mix it up and the powder stays suspended in there.

58:27.800 --> 58:32.600
 It just doesn't actually ever become a clear liquid

58:32.600 --> 58:33.940
 that you can inject.

58:33.940 --> 58:36.920
 So in order to try injecting different strengths

58:36.920 --> 58:40.520
 of uric acid, he ended up using lithium

58:40.520 --> 58:43.760
 to assist in the dilution and lithium worked.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.120
 So what he basically was doing, again for you chemists,

58:46.120 --> 58:49.440
 is he was taking uric acid, he was adding lithium

58:49.440 --> 58:52.780
 and making a solution of lithium urate, okay?

58:52.780 --> 58:55.440
 This is a lot of details, but this is important

58:55.440 --> 58:57.520
 because what he eventually found

58:57.520 --> 59:01.520
 is that when he diluted the uric acid with lithium

59:01.520 --> 59:02.880
 and created lithium urate,

59:02.880 --> 59:07.160
 lithium urate could actually calm down these guinea pigs

59:07.160 --> 59:10.280
 that were injected with the toxic urea.

59:10.280 --> 59:13.160
 He also found that lithium urate

59:13.160 --> 59:16.880
 had a generally calming effect on these guinea pigs.

59:16.880 --> 59:19.560
 So now we're really off in crazy territory, right?

59:19.560 --> 59:21.720
 We're talking about urine from patients

59:21.720 --> 59:24.920
 that's separating out urea and uric acid.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.020
 We're adding lithium to the uric acid.

59:27.020 --> 59:28.640
 We're injecting this into guinea pigs.

59:28.640 --> 59:30.760
 This is getting pretty wild and pretty weird,

59:30.760 --> 59:33.400
 but this is medicine and from time to time,

59:33.400 --> 59:35.000
 this is medicine and science.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.880
 Cade was a good scientist

59:37.880 --> 59:39.880
 in addition to being a good physician.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.520
 And by good scientists,

59:41.520 --> 59:43.440
 I mean that he did control experiments.

59:43.440 --> 59:47.440
 Here he was injecting lithium urate

59:47.440 --> 59:49.620
 into animals and seeing an effect,

59:49.620 --> 59:52.720
 but he knew that that solution of lithium urate

59:52.720 --> 59:55.480
 contained not just the uric acid,

59:55.480 --> 59:57.040
 but it also contained lithium.

59:57.040 --> 1:00:00.040
 And so he quite appropriately asked,

1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:04.080
 maybe the lithium alone is having this calming effect

1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:05.560
 on these guinea pigs.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.280
 And indeed that was the case.

1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:09.240
 When he did the proper control experiment

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:14.240
 and injected only lithium solution into these guinea pigs,

1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:15.520
 they calmed down.

1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:20.080
 From there, he in sort of 1940s style medicine,

1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:21.800
 this would not happen now,

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.000
 he very quickly moved from that animal model

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.720
 into human patients and started injecting human patients

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:31.640
 with lithium or providing lithium orally to those patients.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:36.120
 And lo and behold, found an absolutely profound

1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:38.880
 and positive effect of lithium

1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:41.360
 in reducing symptoms of mania.

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:44.020
 And as all good physician scientists do,

1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:45.720
 he wrote up his results.

1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:48.960
 And he wrote it up in a paper entitled

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:52.360
 Lithium Salts in the Treatment of Psychotic Excitement.

1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:53.640
 Okay, back then they didn't call it mania,

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:55.880
 they called it psychotic excitement.

1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:58.720
 This is a paper that was published September 3rd, 1949

1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:00.640
 in the Medical Journal of Australia.

1:01:00.640 --> 1:01:02.180
 We will provide a link to this study

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:05.520
 is now a classic study in the field of psychiatry.

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:07.240
 It's a really wonderful paper to read.

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.240
 And actually I encourage people,

1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:12.680
 even if you're not a scientist or a clinician

1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:15.640
 to just take a quick look at the second page in this paper

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.800
 that we've made available to you,

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:21.400
 where he describes each of the various case studies

1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:23.840
 or the individuals that he looked at.

1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:25.160
 I'm not going to read these in detail now

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:27.120
 because it would take a lot of unnecessary time,

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:31.660
 but things like case seven, MC, aged 40 years old,

1:01:31.660 --> 1:01:33.640
 suffering from manic recurrent mania.

1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:34.820
 In this episode, he'd been excited,

1:01:34.820 --> 1:01:36.920
 restless and violent for over two months

1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:37.960
 and was interfering so often

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:40.520
 that he had to be confined to a single room during the day.

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.800
 So this is very debilitating,

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:44.960
 what we now know to be bipolar depression.

1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:48.340
 He commenced taking lithium citrate 20 grains,

1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:50.360
 that's a measure of the amount of lithium,

1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:51.200
 three times a day.

1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:53.760
 In four days, he was distinctly quieter.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:58.440
 And by February 13th, 1949 appeared practically normal.

1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:00.940
 He continued well and on February 20th, 1949,

1:02:00.940 --> 1:02:03.080
 the dose of citrate was reduced to 10 grains,

1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:03.920
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:05.360
 He left the hospital.

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:07.900
 There are numerous descriptions of this sort

1:02:07.900 --> 1:02:10.340
 within this paper, including some descriptions of patients

1:02:10.340 --> 1:02:12.860
 that did not see such success

1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:15.240
 and including some descriptions of patients

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:18.200
 that suffered from some negative side effects.

1:02:18.200 --> 1:02:20.000
 So that's important to point out as well,

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.280
 but it's an absolutely wonderful paper

1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:24.720
 and it's an absolutely wonderful voyage

1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:26.300
 into the history of psychiatry,

1:02:26.300 --> 1:02:27.560
 right down to the discussion

1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:30.300
 where in just three short paragraphs,

1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:34.240
 Cade really lays out the case for why lithium

1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:36.680
 is such an important discovery in the treatment

1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:39.480
 of what at that time they were calling psychotic excitement

1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:43.300
 and what we now know to be manic bipolar depression.

1:02:43.300 --> 1:02:44.800
 Lithium, I should mention,

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.420
 has a number of important features,

1:02:46.420 --> 1:02:48.680
 but also a number of important side effects

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:49.720
 that need to be considered.

1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:53.160
 First of all, it does have a certain toxicity

1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:55.180
 and so levels of lithium in the blood

1:02:55.180 --> 1:02:57.700
 need to be monitored extremely carefully.

1:02:57.700 --> 1:02:58.680
 So it's not the sort of thing

1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:00.820
 that people can just take at a given dose

1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:02.480
 and every patient responds the same.

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:03.760
 There's a lot of oversight

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:05.560
 and a lot of blood tests that have to be done,

1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:08.840
 especially in the first three months of lithium treatment.

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:11.600
 I should mention that lithium treatment is still used

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.160
 to some great degree of success in many,

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:17.840
 not all people suffering from bipolar depression

1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:20.360
 or bipolar disorder rather,

1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.840
 but there are a number of important things that happen

1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:28.240
 between 1949 and present day that prevented lithium

1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:31.480
 from reaching patients that really needed it.

1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:33.140
 And that all can be summarized

1:03:33.140 --> 1:03:35.140
 in two or three short sentences,

1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:37.360
 basically by virtue of the fact

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:39.840
 that lithium is a naturally occurring element,

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:41.360
 it could not be patented.

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:43.100
 And as a consequence of that,

1:03:43.100 --> 1:03:46.120
 there wasn't a lot of potential profit for drug companies

1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:48.400
 to produce lithium, in fact, still to this day,

1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:50.680
 it's very low cost.

1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:52.160
 And still to this day,

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.680
 no one really owns the patent for lithium

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:56.280
 in its purest form.

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:57.760
 So that made it unattractive.

1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:00.080
 It turns out that the FDA in the United States

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:02.560
 didn't allow lithium to be used as a treatment

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:06.720
 for manic bipolar disorder until 1970.

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:08.840
 So we're talking about a full 21 years

1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:11.120
 from the publication of this paper

1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:13.100
 by Cade in the Medical Journal of Australia

1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:16.680
 showing quite beautifully the great potential

1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:19.760
 and use of lithium for quelling the symptoms

1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.680
 of bipolar disorder until the first patients

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:24.840
 in the United States were starting

1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:26.560
 to access lithium regularly.

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:28.280
 And nowadays, of course, lithium is available,

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:30.480
 but still not able to be patented

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:32.800
 because it's element number three on the periodic table,

1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:34.180
 it's naturally occurring.

1:04:34.180 --> 1:04:36.120
 It's not literally falling down from the stars

1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:37.740
 as stardust and going into pill form,

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:41.940
 but rather it can be synthesized in laboratories,

1:04:41.940 --> 1:04:43.400
 but it is available.

1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:47.040
 It does show not only great potential in many patients,

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.200
 but great application in many patients

1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:51.120
 despite its side effects.

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:55.200
 So lithium really stands as this kind of golden example

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:58.680
 of a treatment that works, at least in many individuals,

1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:01.960
 prior to an understanding of the biological basis

1:05:01.960 --> 1:05:04.920
 of the disease for which that treatment is needed.

1:05:04.920 --> 1:05:07.040
 Now, with that said, scientists and clinicians

1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:09.760
 have been quite rigorous in trying to understand

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:13.080
 why and how lithium works in order to understand

1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:15.240
 the why and how of bipolar disorder.

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.560
 This is the way that proper medicine and science is done.

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:20.120
 Even if there's an excellent treatment for something,

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:22.980
 it's important to understand why that treatment works

1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:25.320
 because first of all, not everyone responds

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.160
 to that treatment.

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:29.400
 Second of all, scientists and physicians understand

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.960
 that just because we have one treatment that works,

1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:34.280
 if it has any side effects at all,

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:36.720
 there is the possibility for better treatments.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:39.840
 So it's not just about trying to bypass a drug

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:41.700
 that doesn't make much money for drug companies.

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:43.360
 I know a lot of people think in those terms,

1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:44.780
 they think, oh, well, you know,

1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:46.680
 there's this continued search for better treatments

1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:48.960
 for bipolar disorder, even though lithium works

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:50.600
 because lithium doesn't allow drug companies

1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:51.640
 to make much money.

1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:52.840
 That's not really the case.

1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:55.240
 The fact of the matter is, is that the toxicity,

1:05:55.240 --> 1:05:58.600
 some of the other issues that are created with lithium,

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:01.560
 the fact that people need the ongoing blood testing,

1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:04.560
 et cetera, really stimulates the need,

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:07.280
 really an urgent need for new and better treatments

1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:08.160
 for bipolar disorder.

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:10.360
 And only by understanding how lithium works

1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.880
 at the cellular level, at the neural circuit level,

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.060
 et cetera, do we really stand to find those new discoveries.

1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:18.320
 If you were to do a literature search

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:22.000
 on the actions and mechanisms of lithium

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.280
 in terms of how it can calm people down

1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:26.320
 and reduce their manic episodes,

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:29.040
 you would find an enormous array of papers,

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:31.680
 literally thousands of scientific studies

1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:35.040
 in animals and in humans, which, for instance,

1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:37.240
 will tell you that lithium treatment

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.680
 will increase so-called BDNF,

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:42.320
 brain-derived neutrophic factor.

1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:44.000
 BDNF is often talked about

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.740
 in the context of neuroplasticity,

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:48.080
 the brain and nervous system's ability to change

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:49.440
 in response to experience.

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:53.380
 And indeed, it does seem that ingesting lithium

1:06:53.380 --> 1:06:54.960
 increases BDNF.

1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:59.320
 BDNF is what we call permissive for neuroplasticity.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:02.080
 It doesn't create specific changes in the brain,

1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:04.400
 meaning it's not going to make your memory better

1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:06.360
 or your coordination better

1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:08.800
 or your emotional state better per se.

1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:13.560
 What BDNF does is it permits the neurons, the nerve cells,

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.040
 and their connections in the brain

1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:17.920
 to be more likely to change

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.600
 if the proper environmental conditions are met.

1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:25.200
 That is, BDNF creates a kind of buoyancy

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:26.560
 to neuroplasticity.

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:28.960
 It opens the gates to neuroplasticity.

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:31.200
 So lithium does increase BDNF.

1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:32.480
 We'll talk about why that's important

1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:34.880
 in the context of the neural circuits involved

1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:37.400
 with bipolar disorder in a few minutes.

1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:41.240
 It also seems to be a potent anti-inflammatory.

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:42.880
 Now, inflammation is one of those words

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:45.200
 that's thrown around extensively nowadays,

1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:46.440
 especially on social media

1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:48.760
 and especially as it relates to any health condition.

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:50.940
 It's like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation

1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:52.620
 always seems to be discussed

1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:54.440
 in the context of inflammation being bad.

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:56.080
 But I do want to point out

1:07:56.080 --> 1:07:59.160
 that inflammation is a natural adaptive response

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:03.220
 to physical injury to a cell or organ or tissue of any kind.

1:08:03.220 --> 1:08:05.040
 Inflammation is the basis

1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:08.240
 by which adaptations occur to exercise.

1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:10.760
 So for instance, you were to weight train

1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:12.680
 and use a heavier than normal weight

1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:14.040
 and do a set to failure

1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:16.240
 or create some little micro tears in the muscle

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:17.740
 that are healthy in the sense

1:08:17.740 --> 1:08:19.720
 that they would create adaptations

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.400
 and make that muscle stronger, maybe even grow that muscle.

1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:24.700
 There's an inflammatory response associated with that

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.400
 that is critical to the positive adaptation.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:29.480
 So inflammation isn't always bad,

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:33.920
 although excessive or as we say, runaway inflammation is bad.

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:36.680
 Lithium seems to be able to suppress inflammation

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:40.160
 and importantly, it can suppress inflammation

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:43.160
 in neural tissues and within the brain in particular.

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:45.960
 That is important and we will return to that

1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:48.360
 and why it's important in a little bit.

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:49.880
 The other thing about lithium

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.920
 is that lithium is neuroprotective.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:56.120
 That is, it can prevent neurons from dying

1:08:56.120 --> 1:08:57.280
 under certain conditions.

1:08:57.280 --> 1:08:58.400
 Why would neurons die?

1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:00.400
 Well, there are a lot of reasons why neurons can die.

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:01.920
 There can be a physical insult to the neurons.

1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.680
 You can get hit really hard in the head.

1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:07.680
 A bullet, God forbid, can enter the skull and kill neurons.

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:10.520
 There are a lot of reasons why neurons can die.

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:13.920
 Neuroprotection is a situation

1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:16.560
 in which a neuron is given some sort of chemical

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:18.240
 or physical resiliency

1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:21.920
 that allows it to suffer an insult and yet bounce back.

1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:23.200
 So it's very similar to the way

1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:25.000
 that we think about psychological resiliency.

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.200
 Neuroprotection is an ability for neurons

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:31.700
 to be better able to handle stress of different kinds.

1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:34.240
 In particular, excitotoxicity.

1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:36.600
 There's a phenomenon in bipolar disorder

1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:38.680
 and a lot of other psychiatric conditions

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:41.720
 in which hyperactivity of certain brain areas

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:44.440
 actually starts to kill off neurons.

1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.280
 Hyperactivity doesn't always do this,

1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:48.120
 but it turns out that if certain brain circuits

1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:49.800
 are too active for too long,

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:52.560
 some of the chemicals associated with neuronal activity,

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:55.360
 things like calcium and neurotransmitters like glutamate,

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.840
 can actually kill the very neurons that are active.

1:09:57.840 --> 1:09:59.600
 So it seems that lithium can prevent

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:00.920
 some of that neurotoxicity.

1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:03.800
 Now, this turns out to be particularly important

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:05.720
 for this discussion about bipolar disorder

1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:08.440
 and the neural circuit basis of bipolar disorder,

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:10.600
 because if we were to just take a step back and ask,

1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:12.000
 what's different in the brains

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.040
 of people with bipolar disorder?

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:16.900
 There are some very interesting answers that start to emerge.

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:19.400
 There are basically two main neural circuits

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:22.600
 that are present in normal individuals.

1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:24.720
 I say normal, I say that respectfully

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.000
 to the people with bipolar disorder

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000
 by referring to people who do not suffer

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.480
 from manic episodes or from manic depression.

1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:33.780
 There are circuits that are present

1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:35.280
 in people with bipolar disorder

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:40.520
 and in people that do not suffer from bipolar disorder.

1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:43.560
 Both of those circuits do the same thing

1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:45.360
 in both sets of individuals.

1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:47.840
 And yet in people with bipolar disorder,

1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:49.960
 there seems to be an atrophy

1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:53.240
 or a removal of certain neural connections over time

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.200
 that leads to a situation

1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:59.600
 in which people with bipolar disorder become very poor

1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:02.240
 at registering their own internal state,

1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:04.140
 in particular, their emotional states

1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:05.840
 and their somatic states.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:06.780
 What we're referring to here

1:11:06.780 --> 1:11:08.480
 is something called interoception.

1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:09.460
 I've talked about this a little bit

1:11:09.460 --> 1:11:11.260
 on the Huberman Lab podcast before,

1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:13.780
 but there are two modes of perception.

1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:16.680
 Perception, of course, is a attention

1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:18.800
 to something that's happening in our environment

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:21.940
 or to us on or within our body.

1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:25.100
 Exteroception is literally an attention

1:11:25.100 --> 1:11:27.120
 to things that are happening beyond the confines

1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:27.960
 of our skin.

1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:29.960
 So seeing that person's face over there

1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:32.660
 or seeing that color of leaf over there

1:11:32.660 --> 1:11:34.660
 or hearing a sound over to my left.

1:11:34.660 --> 1:11:36.400
 That is exteroception,

1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:39.640
 perception of things beyond the confines of one's skin.

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:41.400
 Then there's interoception,

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:44.240
 which is perception of things that are happening internally,

1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:46.160
 like how full does my gut feel?

1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:48.540
 How fast is my heart beating?

1:11:48.540 --> 1:11:50.500
 Some people can measure that quite accurately

1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:51.520
 just by thinking about it.

1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:53.300
 Other people can't.

1:11:53.300 --> 1:11:54.480
 How happy am I?

1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:55.680
 How sad am I?

1:11:55.680 --> 1:11:56.920
 How energetic am I?

1:11:56.920 --> 1:11:58.040
 How lethargic am I?

1:11:58.040 --> 1:11:59.020
 Et cetera, et cetera.

1:11:59.020 --> 1:12:00.720
 So we are always existing in a balance

1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:03.440
 between exteroception and interoception.

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:04.840
 But as it turns out,

1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:07.720
 people with bipolar disorder over time,

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.400
 and especially into the second and third decade

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:11.960
 of having bipolar disorder,

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:15.240
 seem to have progressively diminished levels

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:16.480
 of interoception.

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:18.280
 And that very likely is important

1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.520
 in their inability to register, for instance,

1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:23.760
 that, wow, they are talking at an excessive rate

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:27.280
 or they haven't slept in five or even 10 days,

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:30.200
 or they haven't eaten in a long period of time.

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:35.200
 This atrophy of neural circuits for interoception

1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:37.040
 is starting to emerge

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:40.020
 as one of the defining neural circuit characteristics

1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:42.120
 or underpinnings of bipolar.

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.880
 Now, I bridged to this conversation about neural circuits

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:48.720
 from the statement that lithium can protect

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:51.640
 against some of the neurotoxic effects

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.420
 of neural circuits being very active.

1:12:53.420 --> 1:12:55.320
 Now, this can get a little bit complicated,

1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:57.060
 but I promise I'm going to make it clear

1:12:57.060 --> 1:12:59.800
 for any of you that are watching and or listening.

1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:03.900
 The reality is that people with bipolar depression

1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:06.280
 very likely have a hyperactivity,

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:08.000
 that is an increased level of activity

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.560
 in certain circuits within the brain

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:12.080
 early in the expression of their disease.

1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:14.300
 And that typically, as I mentioned earlier,

1:13:14.300 --> 1:13:15.920
 sets in around the early 20s,

1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.040
 although sometimes that can be even earlier

1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:19.840
 in the teens and so forth.

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:24.840
 But that hyperactivity, we think, leads to a toxicity,

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:29.160
 an excitotoxicity of certain elements of the neural circuits

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:31.640
 that are responsible for interoception.

1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.440
 In other words, the overuse of certain circuits

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:37.480
 can lead to a diminishing, an atrophy,

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:40.000
 or even a death of certain elements within those circuits.

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.560
 And it appears that lithium,

1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:45.420
 through its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects,

1:13:45.420 --> 1:13:49.160
 and through its ability to increase BDNF,

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.160
 very likely protects us against some of that atrophy

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:54.240
 of those circuits for interoception.

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.400
 So this isn't a case in which, you know,

1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:59.020
 people with bipolar have a neural circuit

1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:00.060
 or lack a neural circuit,

1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:02.200
 and people without bipolar are the opposite.

1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:03.360
 This is a case in which everyone

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:05.080
 more or less starts out the same,

1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:07.240
 but it seems that there's a hyperactivity

1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.840
 of certain neural circuits in people with bipolar disorder

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:13.440
 that over time actually causes those circuits to diminish.

1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:14.560
 Now, this is very important

1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:17.320
 because some of the more recent longitudinal studies

1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:19.400
 doing brain imaging on people with bipolar disorder

1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:21.960
 and those without, and doing that over time

1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:23.840
 in patients starting as early as their teens,

1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:25.800
 but into their 20s and 30s,

1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:27.620
 reveals just that,

1:14:27.620 --> 1:14:29.920
 that there can be hyperactivity of circuits early on,

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:33.800
 but then hypo, reduced activity of those very same circuits

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.360
 at a time five or 10 years later.

1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:38.240
 Again, this speaks to the complicated nature

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:41.840
 of bipolar disorder and the complicated nature of psychiatry

1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:45.000
 and linking specific psychiatric disorders

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.880
 to neural circuits in general.

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:49.840
 Because if you have a situation in which, you know,

1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:53.600
 in one disease, let's just hypothesize here for a second

1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:55.900
 that for instance, in certain forms of schizophrenia,

1:14:55.900 --> 1:14:57.080
 there's elevated dopamine,

1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:58.920
 and were we to just reduce the amount of dopamine

1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:00.140
 that they would receive relief

1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:02.200
 from those schizophrenic symptoms?

1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:04.440
 Well, that's all pretty straightforward on the face of it.

1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:06.440
 But in this situation with bipolar disorder,

1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:09.240
 what we're talking about is hyperactivity, too much activity,

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:12.000
 leading to hypoactivity through death

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:12.960
 of those very circuits.

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:16.800
 And so now you can especially appreciate why

1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:19.080
 when the patient shows up to the psychiatrist

1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:20.800
 or when the psychiatrist shows up to the patient

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:23.200
 in the total course of their disease

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:24.420
 is going to be very important.

1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:26.880
 And then layer on top of that the complexity of the fact

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:30.160
 that the very defining characteristic of bipolar disorder

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:31.860
 is that there are oscillations in mood.

1:15:31.860 --> 1:15:33.760
 So now we need to think about treatments

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:35.600
 not just for the manic episodes,

1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:38.060
 but also treatments for the depressive episodes.

1:15:38.060 --> 1:15:40.360
 And that's in fact what psychiatrists do.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:42.720
 Turns out that they apply different treatments

1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:44.400
 or combinations of treatments

1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:46.540
 for patients that are in manic episodes

1:15:46.540 --> 1:15:47.960
 versus depressive episodes.

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:51.460
 And they have to infer all that from discussions.

1:15:51.460 --> 1:15:53.140
 Again, just exchange of words,

1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:56.740
 depending on when that person walked into their office,

1:15:56.740 --> 1:15:59.440
 where they are in terms of manic episodes,

1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.080
 no symptomology or depressive symptomology,

1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:04.500
 and whether or not they've had that symptomology

1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.000
 for an extended period of time.

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.640
 And then just to make the situation even more complicated,

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:10.300
 the very circuits that atrophy

1:16:10.300 --> 1:16:12.040
 that start to wane and disappear

1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:13.480
 in people with bipolar disorder

1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:15.580
 are the circuits for interoception,

1:16:15.580 --> 1:16:17.800
 for understanding of what's going on in one's own body.

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:20.280
 So you can imagine if you sit down and ask somebody,

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:23.400
 well, how long has it been since you slept?

1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:26.120
 That person may genuinely not know.

1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:28.680
 Or if you ask the very depressed person,

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:29.720
 how depressed are you?

1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:32.560
 That person may not be able to articulate that.

1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:34.920
 So fortunately, there are solutions to this.

1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:38.600
 And the solution is that more often than not,

1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:40.300
 the accurate understanding of whether or not

1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:43.280
 someone has bipolar depression or not,

1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.200
 and what stage of the illness they might be in or not

1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:50.320
 is going to depend on the reports of people around them

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.240
 and not the patient themselves.

1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:55.400
 Hence, the importance of having a rather detailed

1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:57.560
 and admittedly a rather intense discussion

1:16:57.560 --> 1:16:59.880
 about the symptomology of bipolar disorder

1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:03.440
 so that you can have an understanding

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:06.160
 of the people around you and have an eye and an ear

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:07.360
 to whether or not those people

1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:08.720
 might be suffering from bipolar,

1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:10.680
 and if so, at what stage of the disease

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:11.960
 they might happen to be at.

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:13.240
 Now I'd like to talk a little bit more

1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:15.280
 about what is known about the neural circuits

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:17.380
 that lead to the manic states,

1:17:17.380 --> 1:17:18.640
 as well as the depressive states,

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:22.320
 but mainly the manic states of bipolar disorder.

1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:25.320
 We already discussed the fact that interoception,

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:27.520
 registering of one's own internal emotions

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:29.220
 and bodily states is diminished

1:17:29.220 --> 1:17:31.160
 in people with bipolar disorder,

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:33.280
 but we haven't really talked about the neural circuits

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:35.820
 that are responsible for that lack of recognition.

1:17:36.820 --> 1:17:38.960
 For that reason, I'd like to point out a paper.

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:41.720
 This is a fairly recent paper, just came out this year,

1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:43.520
 but it's an excellent one

1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:46.360
 looking at the changes over time in neural circuitry

1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:50.360
 in people with high genetic risk for bipolar disorder,

1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:51.840
 and in particular, in young people.

1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:54.320
 And studies of this sort are rare,

1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:56.640
 but are exceedingly important because of the fact

1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:58.680
 that they track individuals over time.

1:17:58.680 --> 1:17:59.920
 The title of this paper is

1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:02.400
 Longitudinal Changes in Structural Connectivity

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:05.880
 in Young People at High Genetic Risk for Bipolar Disorder.

1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:07.580
 We will provide a link to this study

1:18:07.580 --> 1:18:09.200
 in the show note captions.

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:12.080
 There are a lot of data in this paper,

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:14.840
 in particular, neuroimaging data,

1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:17.520
 and it's quite extensive in terms of analyzing

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:19.560
 the so-called connectomics.

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:21.080
 You've probably heard of genomics,

1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:24.000
 which is the analysis of genes and their display

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.920
 in different individuals or different animals, et cetera.

1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:29.680
 You have proteomics, which is the display of

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:31.180
 or the existence of different proteins.

1:18:31.180 --> 1:18:33.280
 So omics is a big thing now in science.

1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:35.000
 You kind of throw omics behind anything

1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.320
 and it becomes its own Wikipedia page,

1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:39.200
 which means it becomes its own thing.

1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:42.400
 So to speak, I say that only partially in jest.

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.920
 Nonetheless, connectomics is the analysis of connections

1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:50.120
 between different neurons and neural circuit elements.

1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:52.000
 And what this paper really showed

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.360
 by analyzing the connectomics of neural circuits

1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:57.160
 in the brains of many different people

1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:01.840
 with different categories of and onset of

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:05.400
 and severity of bipolar disorder,

1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:10.160
 as well as controls in different age groups, et cetera,

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:14.920
 is that people who are a particularly high risk

1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:16.400
 for having bipolar disorder

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:19.200
 or that have full-blown bipolar disorder

1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:22.280
 have deficits and actually reductions

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:23.720
 in the amount of connectivity

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.920
 between what are called the parietal brain regions

1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:27.240
 and the limbic system.

1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:28.800
 Now, the limbic system I've talked about before

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:30.620
 in this podcast, if you're not familiar with it,

1:19:30.620 --> 1:19:32.900
 I'll explain what it is in a moment.

1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:34.780
 It's simply a collection of brain structures,

1:19:34.780 --> 1:19:35.800
 not one brain structure,

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:37.760
 but a collection of brain structures

1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:39.600
 that generally are responsible

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:43.240
 for shifting the overall state that we're in

1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:46.360
 from states of more relaxed and calm

1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:48.820
 to states of more alert and focused.

1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:51.980
 The limbic system is intimately related

1:19:51.980 --> 1:19:53.940
 to the so-called autonomic nervous system,

1:19:53.940 --> 1:19:56.080
 which regulates our sleep-wake cycles

1:19:56.080 --> 1:19:59.000
 and a number of other things like our digestion, et cetera,

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000
 our level of hunger and on and on.

1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.040
 So the limbic system is really kind of like a volume control

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:07.480
 or as nerd scientists like to say,

1:20:07.480 --> 1:20:11.120
 a kind of game control on the overall level

1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:13.960
 or amplitude of alertness or calmness.

1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:15.600
 In fact, if we're very, very calm,

1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:18.620
 we are asleep or even more calm, we can be in a coma.

1:20:18.620 --> 1:20:20.960
 If we are very alert, we can be wide awake

1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:22.760
 and ready to work and run, et cetera.

1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:25.020
 Or if we are very, very, very alert

1:20:25.020 --> 1:20:27.540
 by way of limbic autonomic interactions,

1:20:27.540 --> 1:20:29.340
 well, then we can be in anxiety,

1:20:29.340 --> 1:20:33.380
 we can be in full-blown panic attack, or we can be in mania.

1:20:33.380 --> 1:20:35.020
 We can have so much energy

1:20:35.020 --> 1:20:36.440
 that we feel like we don't need to sleep.

1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:38.780
 And in fact, disruptions in the circuitry

1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:41.120
 really seems to be what's going on

1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.820
 in people who have bipolar disorder.

1:20:43.820 --> 1:20:46.960
 Now, if disruptions in the circuitry

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:48.300
 are present in the limbic system,

1:20:48.300 --> 1:20:50.680
 that doesn't necessarily mean that the limbic system

1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:53.140
 is at fault because the way that neural circuits work

1:20:53.140 --> 1:20:55.500
 is that different brain areas are talking to one another

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:57.060
 through electrical chemical signaling

1:20:57.060 --> 1:20:58.540
 and they are regulating one another.

1:20:58.540 --> 1:21:01.060
 And what this paper really tells us

1:21:01.060 --> 1:21:03.300
 is that there are elements within the parietal lobe,

1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:04.900
 which is a kind of a section of the brain

1:21:04.900 --> 1:21:06.220
 that sits off to the side.

1:21:06.220 --> 1:21:07.380
 It's not really off to the side,

1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:10.740
 but in neuroanatomical nomenclature,

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:15.740
 the parietal lobe is connected in two ways, bidirectionally.

1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:18.180
 So parietal lobe is connecting to limbic system

1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:20.660
 and limbic system is connecting to parietal lobe.

1:21:20.660 --> 1:21:21.980
 And in people with bipolar disorder,

1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:23.380
 it seems that the parietal lobe

1:21:23.380 --> 1:21:26.580
 is able to exert less top-down control,

1:21:26.580 --> 1:21:28.540
 that is less suppression

1:21:28.540 --> 1:21:30.740
 of certain elements of the limbic system,

1:21:30.740 --> 1:21:34.340
 which at least right now is leading researchers

1:21:34.340 --> 1:21:36.380
 to hypothesize that the limbic system

1:21:36.380 --> 1:21:39.580
 is sort of revving at higher levels.

1:21:39.580 --> 1:21:41.260
 It's kind of like RPM in your cars

1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:44.840
 or kind of redlining at times and for durations

1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:47.240
 that are inappropriate or at least abnormal.

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:51.700
 So we have two major sets of neural circuit deficits

1:21:51.700 --> 1:21:53.620
 or changes in people with bipolar.

1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:55.700
 Their lack of internal awareness is reduced

1:21:55.700 --> 1:21:58.300
 and that turns out to be by way of neural structures

1:21:58.300 --> 1:22:00.940
 like the insula, which is a brain region

1:22:00.940 --> 1:22:03.580
 that is connected in a very direct way

1:22:03.580 --> 1:22:05.700
 to our somatosensory cortex,

1:22:05.700 --> 1:22:09.820
 so the part of our cortex that registers how we feel,

1:22:09.820 --> 1:22:13.100
 literally, sense of touch and internal state.

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:15.380
 So those circuits, excuse me,

1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:17.740
 for those of you listening, I just bumped the microphone,

1:22:17.740 --> 1:22:20.780
 excuse me, those circuits are disrupted

1:22:20.780 --> 1:22:24.260
 in people with bipolar and the top-down control,

1:22:24.260 --> 1:22:26.060
 the kind of accelerator and brake

1:22:26.060 --> 1:22:30.040
 on our overall levels of energy are also disrupted.

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:34.100
 Now, that's all fine and good because, well, it's true,

1:22:34.100 --> 1:22:35.740
 at least according to what the data

1:22:35.740 --> 1:22:37.340
 at this point in time tell us,

1:22:37.340 --> 1:22:38.760
 there may be new discoveries to come,

1:22:38.760 --> 1:22:40.620
 but that all seems to be the case,

1:22:40.620 --> 1:22:42.340
 but it doesn't tell us how to modulate

1:22:42.340 --> 1:22:43.980
 or change that circuitry.

1:22:43.980 --> 1:22:47.260
 It also doesn't tell us how something like lithium

1:22:47.260 --> 1:22:50.180
 can actually benefit a large number of patients

1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:53.060
 or how a good number of the other treatments

1:22:53.060 --> 1:22:56.000
 for bipolar disorder, which we'll talk about going forward,

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.060
 can benefit patients with bipolar.

1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:00.460
 So it appears that lithium is exerting its positive effects

1:23:00.460 --> 1:23:04.100
 on bipolar depression treatment, at least in part,

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:06.300
 by preventing the loss of certain neural circuits,

1:23:06.300 --> 1:23:08.140
 namely the neural circuits for interoception

1:23:08.140 --> 1:23:10.900
 and the top-down control over the limbic system.

1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:14.160
 Now, it turns out that by examining lithium's effects

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:16.400
 at an even more reductionist level,

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:18.420
 we can gain really important insight

1:23:18.420 --> 1:23:20.540
 into what's going on in bipolar depression

1:23:20.540 --> 1:23:23.380
 and some of the other treatments for bipolar depression,

1:23:23.380 --> 1:23:25.380
 including behavioral treatments,

1:23:25.380 --> 1:23:27.420
 things like transcranial magnetic stimulation,

1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:29.580
 and even some of the more natural

1:23:29.580 --> 1:23:31.780
 or so-called nutraceutical treatments,

1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:35.360
 including things like high-dose omega-3 supplementation,

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:37.440
 which we're going to talk about extensively.

1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:38.700
 Now, in order to understand

1:23:38.700 --> 1:23:40.060
 what we're going to talk about next,

1:23:40.060 --> 1:23:42.040
 it's important that everybody understand

1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:44.040
 a key concept of neuroplasticity.

1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:45.540
 And this is a key concept,

1:23:45.540 --> 1:23:46.460
 regardless of whether or not

1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:48.440
 one is talking about bipolar depression.

1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:50.060
 In fact, it's something I think everybody,

1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:52.540
 every citizen of Earth should know about,

1:23:52.540 --> 1:23:55.060
 and that's called homeostatic plasticity.

1:23:55.060 --> 1:23:57.740
 Homeostatic plasticity is a particular form

1:23:57.740 --> 1:24:01.140
 of neuroplasticity in which if a neural circuit

1:24:01.140 --> 1:24:04.500
 is overactive for a period of time,

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:07.500
 there are changes that occur at the cellular level

1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:12.040
 that lead to a balance or a homeostatic regulation

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:15.140
 of that circuit so that it's no longer overactive.

1:24:15.140 --> 1:24:18.060
 Conversely, if a neural circuit is underactive

1:24:18.060 --> 1:24:19.240
 for a period of time,

1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:22.160
 certain changes happen within the cells of that circuit

1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:23.620
 to ramp up their activity

1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:26.140
 or make them more likely to be active.

1:24:26.140 --> 1:24:27.880
 And whether or not a neural circuit

1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:30.940
 and the neurons within it become more active

1:24:30.940 --> 1:24:34.120
 or less active in the context of homeostatic plasticity

1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:36.200
 largely depends on one mechanism,

1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:37.580
 and it's a beautiful mechanism

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:38.980
 that I'll make very clear to you right now

1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:41.300
 even if you don't have a background in biology.

1:24:41.300 --> 1:24:43.000
 Neurons communicate with one another

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.760
 by releasing so-called neurotransmitters,

1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:45.740
 which are just chemicals.

1:24:45.740 --> 1:24:48.300
 Those neurotransmitters are vomited out.

1:24:48.300 --> 1:24:49.140
 They're not actually vomited,

1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:51.480
 but they're spit out into the so-called synaptic cleft,

1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:52.500
 often called the synapse.

1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:54.980
 The synapse is just a little gap between neurons.

1:24:54.980 --> 1:24:58.360
 And when they are released into the synapse,

1:24:58.360 --> 1:24:59.280
 they don't just stay there.

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:01.840
 They actually park or bind to receptors

1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:03.840
 on what's called the postsynaptic neuron.

1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:07.120
 And depending on how many receptors they bind to

1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:09.220
 and how many receptors are available, et cetera,

1:25:09.220 --> 1:25:10.820
 they can have a greater or lesser effect

1:25:10.820 --> 1:25:12.300
 on the postsynaptic neuron.

1:25:12.300 --> 1:25:14.240
 This scenario of neurotransmitters

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:16.060
 being released into synapses,

1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:18.720
 then binding to receptors on postsynaptic neurons

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:21.100
 and influencing the electrical excitability

1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:22.540
 of those postsynaptic neurons,

1:25:22.540 --> 1:25:25.680
 sits central to not just the treatment of bipolar disorder,

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:28.780
 but to all treatments of all psychiatric conditions

1:25:28.780 --> 1:25:31.540
 and indeed to things like neuropathic pain as well.

1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:35.000
 For example, the so-called SSRIs,

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.940
 Prozac, Zoloft, and others, et cetera,

1:25:37.940 --> 1:25:41.280
 stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:42.120
 What does that mean?

1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:43.980
 Well, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.

1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:45.020
 It's actually a neuromodulator

1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:46.540
 that's released into the synapse.

1:25:46.540 --> 1:25:48.720
 And then the SSRI,

1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:51.380
 the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,

1:25:51.380 --> 1:25:53.660
 allows more of that serotonin

1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:55.780
 to sit within the synapse for longer, right?

1:25:55.780 --> 1:25:57.380
 It's a reuptake inhibitor.

1:25:57.380 --> 1:26:00.060
 It prevents reuptake by the presynaptic neuron.

1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:02.780
 And that serotonin therefore can park in

1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:05.460
 or dock in the receptors, as it's called,

1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:08.080
 of the postsynaptic neuron in greater numbers

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:11.940
 and have a greater impact on that postsynaptic neuron.

1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:14.340
 So the drugs that are used to treat depression

1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:18.020
 or other things of that sort, things like SSRIs,

1:26:18.020 --> 1:26:20.380
 work by changing the availability

1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:22.100
 of neurotransmitter in the synapse.

1:26:22.100 --> 1:26:24.380
 Other things like MAO inhibitors,

1:26:24.380 --> 1:26:27.460
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors, work a different way.

1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:28.660
 They inhibit the enzyme.

1:26:28.660 --> 1:26:30.460
 Anytime you hear ASE in biology,

1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:33.860
 it's very likely an enzyme which breaks things down.

1:26:33.860 --> 1:26:37.980
 So MAO inhibitors prevent the breakdown,

1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:40.900
 not the reuptake, but the breakdown of neurotransmitter,

1:26:40.900 --> 1:26:43.140
 and therefore allow more neurotransmitter

1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:45.000
 to be available in the synapse

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.500
 and influence the postsynaptic cell.

1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:52.260
 Homeostatic plasticity is a form of neuroplasticity

1:26:52.260 --> 1:26:55.780
 in which overall circuits can become much more excitable

1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:57.580
 or much less excitable

1:26:57.580 --> 1:27:01.500
 by the addition of more receptors in the postsynaptic neuron

1:27:01.500 --> 1:27:03.500
 or by the removal of more receptors

1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:04.660
 from the postsynaptic neuron.

1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:06.660
 And the way this happens is just beautiful.

1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:09.260
 It was first discovered in the visual system,

1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:11.420
 and the person primarily responsible

1:27:11.420 --> 1:27:13.300
 for the discovery of homeostatic plasticity,

1:27:13.300 --> 1:27:14.460
 although there are several,

1:27:14.460 --> 1:27:16.200
 is a woman by the name of Gina Turgiano.

1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:18.700
 She's a professor at Brandeis University.

1:27:18.700 --> 1:27:21.980
 And what the Turgiano laboratory showed was that,

1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:25.220
 for instance, if we are in the dark

1:27:25.220 --> 1:27:26.340
 for a long period of time,

1:27:26.340 --> 1:27:28.840
 literally, we're not seeing much for a long period of time,

1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:31.020
 there's an increase in the number of receptors

1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:32.420
 in the postsynaptic neurons

1:27:32.420 --> 1:27:34.660
 so that a smaller amount of light

1:27:34.660 --> 1:27:36.700
 and excitability within the visual system

1:27:36.700 --> 1:27:39.240
 can lead to greater amounts of activity

1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:40.480
 in the visual system.

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.820
 Conversely, if there's an overactivity

1:27:42.820 --> 1:27:45.020
 or an increase in the activity in the visual system

1:27:45.020 --> 1:27:46.640
 for some period of time,

1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:49.900
 then a number of receptors in the postsynaptic neuron

1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:52.940
 are removed from that postsynaptic neuron surface,

1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:55.740
 making any neurotransmitter that's available

1:27:55.740 --> 1:27:58.140
 only able to bind the receptors that are left

1:27:58.140 --> 1:28:00.540
 and have less of an influence on those cells.

1:28:00.540 --> 1:28:02.380
 In other words, keeping a circuit

1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:04.700
 in so-called homeostatic balance

1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:07.780
 in a particular range of excitability.

1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:10.180
 Now, while that's a mouthful and an earful

1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:13.060
 and a conceptful, I don't know if a conceptful is a word,

1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:15.160
 but in any case, that's a lot to think about,

1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.360
 but all you need to know is that if a neural circuit

1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:19.060
 is very active for a period of time,

1:28:19.060 --> 1:28:20.540
 in normal individuals,

1:28:20.540 --> 1:28:23.260
 there will be a reduction in the amount of activity

1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:26.540
 by way of removing receptors that bind neurotransmitter.

1:28:26.540 --> 1:28:29.280
 Whereas if a neural circuit is very quiet,

1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:30.780
 it's not activated for a period of time,

1:28:30.780 --> 1:28:33.060
 maybe your leg is in a cast, for instance,

1:28:33.060 --> 1:28:35.900
 and you're not activating your quadricep and calves

1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:38.540
 very much well, when that cast comes off,

1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:40.120
 sure, the muscle might be atrophied,

1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:41.980
 but the nerves that connect to that muscle

1:28:41.980 --> 1:28:44.460
 are actually in a position to influence that muscle

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:48.800
 even more once you start using that muscle or those muscles,

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:51.220
 because whatever neurotransmitter is released

1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:54.820
 now has the opportunity to bind to more receptors,

1:28:54.820 --> 1:28:55.740
 in that case, in muscle,

1:28:55.740 --> 1:28:59.220
 or in the case of brain circuits in postsynaptic neurons.

1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:01.940
 So homeostatic plasticity is this beautiful

1:29:01.940 --> 1:29:04.380
 balancing mechanism that makes sure that neural circuits

1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:08.260
 are never too active nor too quiet for too long.

1:29:08.260 --> 1:29:13.260
 And in a beautiful display of how treatments

1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:15.860
 can lead to a better understanding of biology,

1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:19.240
 which can lead to the discovery of even better treatments,

1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:22.380
 lithium and another compound,

1:29:22.380 --> 1:29:24.660
 which we'll talk about ketamine,

1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:28.820
 seem to exert their actions largely through effects

1:29:28.820 --> 1:29:31.440
 on homeostatic neuroplasticity.

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:33.180
 There's a wonderful paper that describes

1:29:33.180 --> 1:29:34.860
 all the nitty gritty of this.

1:29:34.860 --> 1:29:37.180
 Certainly most people listening, I'm guessing,

1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.540
 are not going to be interested in all this detail,

1:29:40.540 --> 1:29:41.720
 but for those of you that you are,

1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:43.600
 and you want to delve deep into this,

1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:46.060
 this paper was published in Neuron, Cell Press Journal,

1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:47.660
 excellent journal.

1:29:47.660 --> 1:29:50.040
 It's titled Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity

1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:51.700
 for the Treatment of Mood Disorders.

1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:53.460
 And there's one particular figure in this paper

1:29:53.460 --> 1:29:54.900
 that I'll just describe to you

1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:58.500
 in which measurements were made from neurons

1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:00.540
 and the number of receptors in those neurons.

1:30:00.540 --> 1:30:02.340
 It's done somewhat indirectly through a method

1:30:02.340 --> 1:30:05.020
 that's detailed and neuroscientists are familiar with.

1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:08.720
 Basically what it measures is how excited a given neuron is,

1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:10.580
 electrically excited a given neuron is

1:30:10.580 --> 1:30:13.400
 to a given amount of neurotransmitter, okay?

1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:15.420
 So the amount of neurotransmitter

1:30:15.420 --> 1:30:16.900
 that's vomited onto a neuron

1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:18.600
 is essentially kept constant,

1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:21.000
 and then the response of the postsynaptic neuron

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:21.840
 is measured.

1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:24.400
 So it can be of one level or higher or lower

1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:27.380
 depending on homeostatic plasticity.

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:30.120
 And what this paper shows,

1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:31.960
 and what's been shown over and over again,

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:36.660
 is that when neurons are exposed to lithium

1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:37.700
 for a period of time,

1:30:37.700 --> 1:30:41.660
 there is a reduction in the excitability

1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:42.820
 of the postsynaptic neuron.

1:30:42.820 --> 1:30:46.900
 That is, neurons within the brain become less excitable

1:30:46.900 --> 1:30:50.060
 over time if lithium is present,

1:30:50.060 --> 1:30:53.840
 whereas ketamine, which is now a common FDA approved,

1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:54.680
 at least in the US,

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:57.500
 it's approved for the treatment of major depression,

1:30:57.500 --> 1:30:59.240
 ketamine does the opposite.

1:30:59.240 --> 1:31:01.680
 Ketamine seems to increase the number of receptors

1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:02.820
 in the postsynaptic neuron

1:31:02.820 --> 1:31:06.120
 and lead to greater levels of excitability

1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:08.340
 and electrical activity within neural circuits

1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:11.340
 to a given fixed amount of neurotransmitter.

1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:12.620
 So this is super interesting

1:31:12.620 --> 1:31:14.140
 because what it means is that lithium

1:31:14.140 --> 1:31:16.580
 is causing circuits to be less active.

1:31:16.580 --> 1:31:19.140
 Ketamine is causing circuits to be more active.

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:22.180
 And we know from excellent clinical data now

1:31:22.180 --> 1:31:25.400
 that ketamine seems to be a very effective treatment

1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:27.280
 for major depression

1:31:27.280 --> 1:31:30.300
 and for the major depressive episodes

1:31:30.300 --> 1:31:33.100
 of people that suffer from bipolar depression

1:31:33.100 --> 1:31:35.020
 that includes these major depressive episodes

1:31:35.020 --> 1:31:37.500
 of two weeks or longer of suppressed mood,

1:31:37.500 --> 1:31:39.860
 appetite, sleep issues, et cetera.

1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:42.100
 Now, the key thing about ketamine

1:31:42.100 --> 1:31:43.980
 that's often not discussed

1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:47.440
 is that while its effects are very potent,

1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:48.840
 they are transient.

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:52.820
 So one major drawback to ketamine therapy for depression

1:31:52.820 --> 1:31:54.580
 is that it has to be done repeatedly.

1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:58.540
 And how repeatedly or how often rather depends, of course,

1:31:58.540 --> 1:32:00.940
 on a discussion between the psychiatrist and the patient.

1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:04.520
 This is not something to cowboy on your own.

1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:07.060
 I know that, and many of you are probably familiar

1:32:07.060 --> 1:32:11.180
 with the fact that ketamine also is abused recreationally.

1:32:11.180 --> 1:32:13.020
 It is a so-called NMDA,

1:32:13.020 --> 1:32:16.060
 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.

1:32:16.060 --> 1:32:17.620
 So it blocks the very receptor

1:32:17.620 --> 1:32:19.700
 that's responsible for neuroplasticity

1:32:19.700 --> 1:32:21.660
 for changes in neural circuits.

1:32:21.660 --> 1:32:23.340
 It also changes excitability in neurons,

1:32:23.340 --> 1:32:24.180
 as I just described.

1:32:24.180 --> 1:32:26.300
 So ketamine is a very potent chemical

1:32:26.300 --> 1:32:28.780
 that has been shown over and over again

1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:30.580
 and is now FDA approved for the treatment

1:32:30.580 --> 1:32:31.400
 of major depression,

1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:33.640
 but its effects seem to be transient.

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:35.540
 Lithium, as I described earlier,

1:32:35.540 --> 1:32:39.540
 seems to reduce the manic episodes

1:32:39.540 --> 1:32:41.760
 or the intensity of manic episodes and symptomology

1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:43.300
 in people with bipolar disorder.

1:32:43.300 --> 1:32:45.140
 It's doing that through neural protection.

1:32:45.140 --> 1:32:47.340
 So protecting neural circuits from dying away

1:32:47.340 --> 1:32:48.980
 that initially are overactive

1:32:48.980 --> 1:32:50.940
 and that overactivity causing excitotoxicity.

1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:54.460
 It blocks that excitotoxicity, we believe.

1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:58.200
 And it seems to do that in part

1:32:58.200 --> 1:33:01.460
 by diminishing the amount of activity in those circuits.

1:33:01.460 --> 1:33:04.020
 So this is a beautiful mechanistic story,

1:33:04.020 --> 1:33:06.340
 and it's the sort of story that you'd love to have

1:33:06.340 --> 1:33:08.820
 for a great number of psychiatric illnesses.

1:33:08.820 --> 1:33:10.960
 And fortunately, we have for bipolar disorder.

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:12.400
 Overactivity of a given circuit

1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:16.460
 eventually leads to neurotoxicity, excuse me.

1:33:16.460 --> 1:33:18.260
 Lithium is preventing that neurotoxicity

1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:20.280
 by reducing the number of receptors

1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:22.340
 in certain elements within those circuits,

1:33:22.340 --> 1:33:24.380
 so-called homeostatic scaling.

1:33:24.380 --> 1:33:26.820
 It's down-regulating the number of receptors,

1:33:26.820 --> 1:33:28.240
 leading to less excitability

1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:31.020
 and preventing, we think, excitotoxicity.

1:33:31.020 --> 1:33:33.180
 And in that sense,

1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:35.500
 you can see exactly why it's important

1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:37.260
 to get lithium treatment in there early

1:33:37.260 --> 1:33:38.900
 for people with bipolar disorder.

1:33:39.860 --> 1:33:41.580
 Ketamine as a treatment for major depression

1:33:41.580 --> 1:33:43.620
 seems to be effective but transient.

1:33:43.620 --> 1:33:45.740
 And you can also see why it would be important

1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:48.580
 not just to reduce the manic episodes

1:33:48.580 --> 1:33:49.820
 for people with bipolar disorder

1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:52.180
 but to also treat the depressive episodes.

1:33:52.180 --> 1:33:53.840
 So this is a key feature of the treatment

1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:56.900
 for bipolar depression and for bipolar disorder.

1:33:56.900 --> 1:33:59.080
 There needs to be treatment both of the mania

1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:01.660
 and of the depressive episodes if they're present.

1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:04.540
 And fortunately, there are excellent drugs to do that.

1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:07.420
 And I should mention that ketamine and lithium

1:34:07.420 --> 1:34:10.380
 are just two of the drugs within the kit

1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:12.400
 that psychiatrists have access to.

1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:14.860
 There are many things, olanzapines

1:34:14.860 --> 1:34:18.260
 and a number of different things, including clozapine.

1:34:18.260 --> 1:34:20.300
 Clozapine is an antipsychotic,

1:34:20.300 --> 1:34:24.700
 which is commonly prescribed as a sedative in some cases

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:26.820
 that allows people in manic episodes to sleep.

1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:28.420
 It's classically described

1:34:28.420 --> 1:34:31.220
 as so-called dopamine receptor four antagonist,

1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:32.900
 although it does other things as well.

1:34:32.900 --> 1:34:35.780
 Clozapine has a number of side effect features

1:34:35.780 --> 1:34:39.020
 related to white blood cell and things of that sort

1:34:39.020 --> 1:34:40.620
 that require careful monitoring.

1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:44.180
 So there are an enormous number now,

1:34:44.180 --> 1:34:46.700
 literally dozens and dozens of different drugs,

1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:49.860
 each designed to target either the manic phase,

1:34:49.860 --> 1:34:53.700
 the depressive phase, or some what we call acute,

1:34:53.700 --> 1:34:56.260
 sort of early phases versus ongoing treatments.

1:34:56.260 --> 1:34:59.420
 This is a vast galaxy of drug treatments

1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:01.460
 that really should be navigated,

1:35:01.460 --> 1:35:03.780
 I should say absolutely should be navigated

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:06.300
 by a board certified psychiatrist.

1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:08.700
 And of course, in close discussion

1:35:08.700 --> 1:35:11.800
 with both the person suffering from bipolar disorder,

1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:14.360
 but also ideally the family members

1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:16.800
 of the person suffering from bipolar disorder.

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:19.940
 But I think at least up until now,

1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:23.940
 we've focused on the two major pathways for treatment,

1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:25.740
 lithium and ketamine.

1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:28.380
 And we talked about why lithium and ketamine work,

1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:29.700
 that they're working on opposite ends

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:30.900
 of this homeostatic scaling.

1:35:30.900 --> 1:35:33.540
 We talked a bit about the circuits that are involved

1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:37.080
 in generating what we think are the manic symptomology

1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:38.340
 and the lack of interoception,

1:35:38.340 --> 1:35:40.440
 why people can just persist in staying awake,

1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:43.040
 awake, awake, not eating, et cetera.

1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:45.940
 Now you have in mind how all that is put together.

1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:47.420
 And I think you have in mind

1:35:47.420 --> 1:35:49.920
 some of the well-demonstrated treatments

1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:52.620
 for the different component parts of bipolar disorder,

1:35:52.620 --> 1:35:54.700
 which now I'm hoping you're also well versed in

1:35:54.700 --> 1:35:57.140
 based on our early, early discussion

1:35:57.140 --> 1:36:00.020
 of what constitutes bipolar one and bipolar two.

1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:02.220
 Now I would like to also talk about

1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:04.900
 some of the not so typical therapeutics

1:36:04.900 --> 1:36:06.460
 for bipolar disorder,

1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:10.260
 and also point to the things that have been tried and failed

1:36:10.260 --> 1:36:12.760
 for successful treatment of bipolar disorder,

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:16.620
 because some of those things are often talked about

1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:19.220
 and suggested, especially in online communities.

1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:21.220
 And while it's not clear that any of them

1:36:21.220 --> 1:36:24.300
 are particularly hazardous on their own,

1:36:24.300 --> 1:36:26.960
 although some of them do carry some hazards,

1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.140
 I do think it's important

1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:30.900
 because of the critical time-sensitive nature

1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:32.940
 of bipolar disorder and the urgency

1:36:32.940 --> 1:36:34.780
 of getting treatments early

1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:36.940
 to try and prevent some of the longer lasting

1:36:36.940 --> 1:36:38.200
 neural circuit changes,

1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:40.660
 that if people can avoid some of the less effective

1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:43.860
 or demonstrated to be ineffective treatments,

1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:46.420
 that they stand to combat bipolar disorder

1:36:46.420 --> 1:36:47.580
 much more successfully.

1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:50.040
 First of all, a key point about drug therapies

1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:53.220
 versus non-drug therapies or talk therapies.

1:36:54.300 --> 1:36:55.480
 Without question,

1:36:55.480 --> 1:36:59.160
 drug therapies are going to be most effective

1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:02.040
 when done also with talk therapies.

1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:03.400
 And we'll talk about which talk therapies

1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:06.160
 have been demonstrated to be most effective.

1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:08.540
 There is some argument about what I'm about to say next,

1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:12.000
 but in general, most psychiatrists will tell you,

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.920
 or certainly the ones I've spoken to have told me,

1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:18.920
 that talk therapy on its own is rarely, if ever,

1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:23.280
 effective for bipolar depression and bipolar disorder,

1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:25.680
 whether or not it's BP1 or BP2.

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:27.360
 That's just the reality of it.

1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.080
 Contrast that with our discussion

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:30.780
 about obsessive compulsive disorder,

1:37:30.780 --> 1:37:32.680
 which we talked about a few episodes ago.

1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:33.940
 If you haven't seen that episode,

1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:36.600
 we have an in-depth episode all about OCD

1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:39.460
 and obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

1:37:39.460 --> 1:37:42.620
 There, it seems that drug therapies and talk therapies

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:45.720
 can be done independently or in combination.

1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:49.120
 As expected, combined drug and talk therapies

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:51.280
 are more effective there than either one alone,

1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:53.520
 but there are pretty impressive effects

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:54.480
 of talk therapy alone,

1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:56.320
 provided that they are initiated at the right time

1:37:56.320 --> 1:37:58.520
 and it's the right form of talk therapy.

1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:01.360
 That's OCD, but in terms of bipolar disorder,

1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:04.880
 it really seems that the drug therapies are necessary,

1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:07.920
 at least in most all cases.

1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:12.000
 That said, talk therapies are a terrific augment

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.600
 or support for those drug therapies

1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:15.800
 and sometimes can allow people to take lower doses

1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:16.680
 of those drug therapies,

1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:17.860
 which turns out to be important

1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:19.240
 because of the side effect profiles

1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:20.240
 of a lot of drug therapies

1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:22.040
 and sometimes the cost as well.

1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:22.960
 I guess we can think of cost

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.760
 just as another side effect, really.

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:28.780
 There are both established and more novel forms

1:38:28.780 --> 1:38:31.520
 of talk therapy being used, again,

1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.220
 in concert with drug treatments for bipolar disorder.

1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:37.520
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is the one

1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:38.740
 that seems to be best,

1:38:38.740 --> 1:38:41.660
 at least by way of the statistics and papers that exist.

1:38:41.660 --> 1:38:43.340
 It's also the one that's been explored the most.

1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:45.460
 So one of the reasons why it's often considered

1:38:45.460 --> 1:38:46.680
 the most popular or effective

1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:48.120
 is because it's also been around longer

1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:50.840
 and it's been explored the most cognitive behavioral therapy

1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:55.460
 in general is a progressive exposure of the patient

1:38:55.460 --> 1:38:57.480
 in a very controlled way in a clinical setting

1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:00.200
 to some of the triggers or the conditions

1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:02.780
 that would exacerbate bipolar disorder.

1:39:02.780 --> 1:39:05.400
 Now, earlier I said borderline personality disorder

1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:07.880
 has all these triggers and triggered elements

1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:08.940
 from the external environment,

1:39:08.940 --> 1:39:10.880
 whereas bipolar disorder does not.

1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:12.760
 And that's still true,

1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:16.800
 but it is the case that somebody with bipolar

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.680
 can have worse symptoms

1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:20.520
 if life conditions get worse or more stressful.

1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:24.080
 So cognitive behavioral therapy in the discussion about,

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:25.800
 and sometimes the direct exposure

1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:29.360
 to anxiety provoking elements of life

1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:33.700
 can be very helpful for adjusting the responses

1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:35.400
 to those otherwise triggering events

1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:37.440
 and sometimes making the drug treatments more effective

1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:38.600
 even at lower doses.

1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:40.480
 There are also forms of therapy

1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:42.800
 including family focused therapy,

1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:46.520
 which is especially important in terms of bipolar disorder

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.740
 because family members,

1:39:49.740 --> 1:39:52.280
 provided that they are not themselves in a manic episode

1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:55.840
 due to the close heritability of bipolar disorder,

1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:59.640
 but family members can often be excellent windows

1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:02.760
 into whether or not somebody is doing well or poorly

1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:04.880
 or is veering toward or is emerging

1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:06.960
 from a manic or depressive episode

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:08.200
 because they understand that person.

1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:09.760
 They have a lot of data.

1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:11.180
 It could be purely subjective data,

1:40:11.180 --> 1:40:12.280
 but they have a lot of exposure

1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:14.200
 to how long or well somebody has been sleeping

1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:15.400
 or eating, et cetera.

1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:17.400
 So family focused therapy involves other members

1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:20.240
 of the person suffering from bipolar disorders family,

1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:24.080
 as well as conversations about family members

1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:27.600
 in a way that helps patients with bipolar disorder navigate

1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.800
 not just through manic episodes and depressive episodes,

1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:32.880
 but start to learn to predict what are the conditions,

1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:35.040
 psychological, physical, and otherwise,

1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:38.080
 that can trigger bipolar episodes.

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:41.040
 And then there's a category of therapy

1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:44.080
 called interpersonal and social rhythm therapy.

1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:48.120
 This is deserving of its own entire episode, really.

1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:49.960
 Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy

1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:53.020
 is sort of an expansion on family focused therapy,

1:40:53.020 --> 1:40:55.360
 although it's distinct in certain ways as well,

1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:58.280
 and really focuses on how people are relating

1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:01.400
 to others in their life and in the workplace

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:03.000
 and in the school environment

1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000
 and also within the family, et cetera.

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.880
 And I should say that a overall theme

1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:10.460
 that's emerging in psychiatry and psychology

1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:12.260
 is to start wherever possible

1:41:12.260 --> 1:41:15.520
 to incorporate more of the social aspects

1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:17.080
 and the interpersonal aspects.

1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:19.920
 In other words, not just talking to and examining a patient

1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:22.560
 as one biological system, one nervous system,

1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:24.560
 one set of chemicals and one life,

1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:27.040
 but rather a set of chemicals, neural circuits,

1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:28.960
 and a life that's embedded in the chemicals

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.720
 and neural circuits and lives of other people.

1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:33.580
 Just by way of example, you can imagine that

1:41:33.580 --> 1:41:35.940
 if somebody is in a very healthy relationship

1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:37.840
 or a very abusive relationship,

1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:39.920
 that that's going to strongly impact

1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:41.720
 the outcomes of manic episodes.

1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:44.380
 You can imagine that if the financial situation

1:41:44.380 --> 1:41:47.600
 is one in which people can recover from manic episodes,

1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:50.360
 I did mention this earlier, but I should have, forgive me,

1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.480
 that oftentimes people who are in a manic episode

1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:54.780
 will go out and spend immense amounts of money

1:41:54.780 --> 1:41:56.920
 that they simply cannot afford to lose.

1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:00.880
 And then the depressive episodes that in many cases follow

1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:05.120
 are made far worse by the financial anxiety

1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:07.260
 and the financial stress that results

1:42:07.260 --> 1:42:09.480
 from those manic episodes of spending, et cetera.

1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:13.280
 And then of course, this carries over to sexual promiscuity

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:15.820
 where people might be dealing with unwanted pregnancy

1:42:15.820 --> 1:42:20.760
 or STIs or very fractured interpersonal dynamics

1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:22.360
 with existing or new relationships.

1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:25.960
 I mean, you can imagine how these manic episodes

1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:28.600
 as well as the depressive episodes can really wick out

1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:31.100
 into an enormous amount of destruction,

1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:35.360
 which brings us back to the initial criteria of BP1 and BP2

1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:39.160
 is that these manic episodes are not a good thing.

1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:41.520
 These depressive episodes are not a good thing.

1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:44.640
 They create this sense of euphoria

1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:46.360
 in the person experiencing mania,

1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.880
 or they create the sense that anything is possible,

1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:52.400
 but at the end of the day, and actually every day,

1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:54.720
 these episodes are quite maladaptive.

1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:56.440
 They really destroy people's lives

1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:58.020
 and it's not just the life of the person

1:42:58.020 --> 1:42:59.460
 that's suffering from bipolar disorder.

1:42:59.460 --> 1:43:01.720
 And so hence, cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:02.920
 family-focused therapy,

1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:04.840
 and interpersonal and social rhythm therapies

1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:07.000
 are the primary three talk therapies

1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.520
 that are most often combined with drug therapies

1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:12.860
 in order to try and really reduce the harm.

1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:15.780
 It's really all about harm reduction

1:43:15.780 --> 1:43:18.260
 from manic episodes and depressive episodes.

1:43:18.260 --> 1:43:20.220
 One very exciting and emerging treatment

1:43:20.220 --> 1:43:22.440
 that does show great promise,

1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:26.220
 and in some cases, great outcomes for bipolar disorder

1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:29.180
 is, believe it or not, electric shock therapy.

1:43:29.180 --> 1:43:31.280
 Electric shock therapy may sound barbaric,

1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:33.280
 and in fact, it tends to look barbaric,

1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:34.900
 although this is done in the controlled setting

1:43:34.900 --> 1:43:35.760
 of a hospital.

1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:38.680
 If any of you have seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,

1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:41.640
 the final scene or near final scene in that movie

1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:45.360
 was Jack Nicholson with the sort of bite protector

1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:47.560
 in his mouth and getting electric shock therapy,

1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:50.620
 and it's, as the name suggests,

1:43:50.620 --> 1:43:53.280
 it's kind of inducing a global seizure,

1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:57.080
 either low-level or grand mal-type seizure

1:43:57.080 --> 1:43:59.760
 in the patient's brain and nervous system.

1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:02.600
 You might ask, well, why would one want to do that?

1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:06.040
 Well, it turns out that this is a well-established

1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:08.400
 and in many cases, very effective treatment

1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:09.640
 for major depression.

1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:12.440
 Electric shock therapy is generally used

1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:14.320
 for treatment-resistant depression,

1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:17.640
 so these are people that have no positive response

1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:19.820
 or ongoing positive response to drug therapies

1:44:19.820 --> 1:44:20.860
 or other therapies.

1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:23.920
 Electric shock therapy is thought to work primarily

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:27.720
 by stimulating the massive kind of indiscriminate release

1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:31.280
 of things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,

1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:33.840
 a huge variety of neuromodulators,

1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:35.560
 as well as things like BDNF,

1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:36.800
 brain-derived neurotrophic factor,

1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:39.280
 which then allows neuroplasticity to take place.

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:42.320
 Again, BDNF being permissive for neuroplasticity.

1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:45.160
 The problem with ECT is that it's really only useful

1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:47.160
 for treatment-resistant depression.

1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:49.460
 It doesn't actually target the manic aspects

1:44:49.460 --> 1:44:52.360
 of bipolar depression and bipolar disorder,

1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:56.000
 but nonetheless is used when drug treatments don't work.

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.740
 Some of the negatives of electric shock therapy

1:44:59.740 --> 1:45:02.560
 or electroconvulsive therapy, ECT,

1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:05.200
 is the proper acronym and way it's described,

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:06.680
 is that it's quite invasive, right?

1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:09.120
 This is something that you need to go to the hospital for

1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:11.560
 and oftentimes there's some inpatient care required

1:45:11.560 --> 1:45:14.100
 after the electric shock convulsive therapy.

1:45:14.100 --> 1:45:15.420
 It's a fairly high cost,

1:45:15.420 --> 1:45:17.820
 especially for those that don't have insurance.

1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:20.160
 And of course it requires anesthesia.

1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:21.640
 For most people, that's not going to be a problem,

1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:24.720
 but for many people that could be a problem.

1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:28.380
 And there's often some associated memory loss.

1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:30.960
 And so the memory loss,

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:34.160
 the invasive nature of ECT and the cost

1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:37.640
 oftentimes rule out ECT for most patients.

1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:39.200
 And that's why it's sort of a late stage

1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:41.080
 or kind of last resort type thing

1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:42.740
 for treatment-resistant depression.

1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:45.600
 Nowadays, ketamine type therapy is done repeatedly

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:46.800
 or other treatments.

1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:50.120
 For instance, transcranial magnetic stimulation,

1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:52.120
 which is basically noninvasive.

1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:55.160
 It's a coil that's placed on the outside of the skull,

1:45:55.160 --> 1:45:56.000
 excuse me.

1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:00.920
 And we can more accurately refer to it as repetitive

1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:04.900
 or RTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

1:46:04.900 --> 1:46:07.640
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a tool

1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:09.680
 that allows researchers and clinicians

1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:12.500
 to reduce the amount of activity in specific neural circuits.

1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:15.160
 So they can actually target the magnetic field

1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:16.160
 to particular neural circuits

1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:18.360
 to reduce activity in those neural circuits.

1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.020
 Again, it's minimally invasive.

1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:21.680
 It has been shown to be effective

1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:25.480
 in both increasing neuroplasticity in positive ways,

1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:27.560
 as well as reducing depressive episodes.

1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:31.960
 And in a few instances in reducing the amplitude

1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:33.620
 or the intensity of manic episodes

1:46:33.620 --> 1:46:35.760
 in people with bipolar disorder.

1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.080
 The problem is it's still a very early technique.

1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:41.080
 There aren't a lot of clinics and labs doing it.

1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:42.920
 I'm starting to see more advertisements,

1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:47.920
 literally commercial clinics that are advertising RTMS or TMS

1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:50.600
 I encourage you to approach those clinics with caution.

1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:53.380
 I'm of the mind that if those clinics

1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:57.000
 are not either closely or maybe even distantly associated

1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:58.200
 with a research institution

1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:00.560
 that's really up on the latest of RTMS,

1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:03.400
 you'd be wise to at least do your research, right?

1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:05.920
 And explore, talk to other patients

1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:07.360
 who've done these treatments.

1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:09.540
 But certainly in university hospitals

1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:11.640
 and in clinical settings and research settings,

1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:15.180
 RTMS is being used as a way to, for instance,

1:47:15.180 --> 1:47:17.760
 reduce the activity of certain limbic circuitries

1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:20.460
 so that people are just overall less excitable and manic.

1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:22.440
 Or to activate,

1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:24.280
 because it can also be used for activation now,

1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.040
 certain neural circuits activate, for instance,

1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:27.180
 the parietal inputs,

1:47:27.180 --> 1:47:29.180
 the top-down control over the limbic system.

1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:30.960
 This is all happening right now.

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:34.960
 So we have ECT, repetitive TMS or RTMS.

1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:36.980
 And then as I mentioned earlier, ketamine therapies,

1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:38.280
 most of those are targeted

1:47:38.280 --> 1:47:41.400
 toward the depressive aspects of manic depression.

1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:42.920
 So for people with bipolar disorder

1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:44.320
 that doesn't include depression,

1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:45.940
 those are going to be less effective.

1:47:45.940 --> 1:47:48.500
 But overall, it's going to be the talk therapies

1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:51.920
 of the sort that we discussed earlier or a moment ago,

1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:54.560
 plus drug treatments,

1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:56.280
 almost always lithium will be explored,

1:47:56.280 --> 1:47:58.940
 plus some treatments for the depressive episodes,

1:47:58.940 --> 1:48:01.920
 in particular, if those depressive episodes are present.

1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:04.960
 Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement about psilocybin,

1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:06.400
 which is a psychedelic.

1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:09.160
 In the US, psilocybin is still illegal.

1:48:09.160 --> 1:48:10.740
 It is not legal,

1:48:10.740 --> 1:48:14.120
 meaning you can get in a lot of trouble for possessing it,

1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:15.840
 certainly for selling it, et cetera.

1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:18.560
 But psilocybin is being explored as a clinical therapy

1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.000
 in certain laboratory settings,

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.640
 in particular, at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:24.240
 It's being explored in human patients

1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:25.760
 for the treatment of major depression,

1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:28.440
 for OCD, I believe, as well,

1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:30.120
 but certainly for major depression

1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:31.200
 and for eating disorders.

1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:34.300
 And it seems from the initial wave of publications

1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:37.860
 from that work done by the incredible Matthew Johnson

1:48:37.860 --> 1:48:38.960
 or Dr. Matthew Johnson,

1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:40.640
 who was a guest on this podcast before.

1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:43.320
 He's also been on the Tim Ferriss podcast.

1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:45.540
 He's been on the Lex Friedman podcast.

1:48:45.540 --> 1:48:48.080
 Dr. Matthew Johnson came on this podcast

1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:49.720
 and talked about some of the work with psilocybin

1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:51.640
 for the treatment of depression.

1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:54.120
 Very impressive results there.

1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:55.360
 And as you can imagine,

1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:56.320
 very impressive results

1:48:56.320 --> 1:48:58.520
 for the major depressive episodes for bipolar.

1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:01.120
 However, at least to my knowledge,

1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:02.620
 again, to my knowledge,

1:49:02.620 --> 1:49:05.000
 there have not been any controlled clinical trials

1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:06.240
 exploring psilocybin

1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:09.020
 for the mania associated with bipolar disorder.

1:49:09.020 --> 1:49:11.360
 If someone out there is aware of those clinical trials,

1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:12.200
 please let me know.

1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:14.000
 I'll do an update in a future podcast.

1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.940
 But right now, no knowledge from me

1:49:16.940 --> 1:49:18.680
 about psilocybin clinical trials

1:49:18.680 --> 1:49:22.400
 for the manic component of bipolar disorder.

1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:24.440
 A number of people are probably also going to wonder

1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:28.400
 about whether or not cannabis or medical marijuana

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:31.060
 is useful for bipolar disorder.

1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:34.260
 To address this, I looked to some previous lectures

1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:37.640
 and some clinicians at Stanford Psychiatry.

1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:39.040
 This question was asked of them.

1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:41.000
 And as it turns out,

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.440
 cannabis does not seem to be effective

1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:47.040
 for the treatment of the manic phases of bipolar disorder

1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:50.360
 or for the treatment of the major depressive component.

1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.780
 The only treatment perhaps,

1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:55.200
 or I should say the only situation perhaps

1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:56.140
 in which it might be useful,

1:49:56.140 --> 1:49:57.760
 and this is what was relayed to me,

1:49:57.760 --> 1:49:59.920
 is that it may help with sleep

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:03.480
 in certain people that are having trouble with insomnia.

1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:05.540
 Although nowadays it's far more common

1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:06.880
 for people in manic episodes

1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:10.400
 to prescribe things like trazodone or other benzos,

1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:11.800
 benzodiazepines,

1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:14.360
 in order to try and get sleep within the manic episodes.

1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:17.000
 And benzodiazepines and trazodone, et cetera,

1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.240
 work largely through the so-called GABA system.

1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.240
 This is a neurotransmitter

1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:25.160
 that causes reductions in excitability of neurons,

1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:27.800
 hence why it's being used to try and calm people down

1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:29.880
 and allow them to sleep during their manic episodes.

1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:32.040
 So not a lot, or essentially no data,

1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:33.280
 supporting the use of cannabis

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:35.800
 for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se,

1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:38.480
 nor data supporting the use of psilocybin

1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:40.460
 for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se.

1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:43.040
 But I realized as I say that,

1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:44.420
 that there are going to be a number of people

1:50:44.420 --> 1:50:46.900
 that may have had positive

1:50:46.900 --> 1:50:49.560
 or negative experiences with cannabis or psilocybin

1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:51.000
 as they relate to bipolar disorder.

1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.840
 So please, if you're willing or comfortable,

1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:54.960
 put that if you're comfortable

1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:57.680
 into the comment section on YouTube.

1:50:57.680 --> 1:50:59.640
 And of course, if you are aware of any studies

1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:03.060
 on cannabis or psilocybin showing positive outcomes

1:51:03.060 --> 1:51:04.920
 for the treatment of bipolar disorder,

1:51:04.920 --> 1:51:07.280
 please provide links or PubMed ideas to those.

1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:08.920
 I'd love to peruse those studies.

1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:12.300
 There are two naturopathic,

1:51:12.300 --> 1:51:15.720
 or I should say nutrition supplement-based approaches

1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:18.720
 to bipolar disorder they get talked about a lot.

1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:22.000
 And one of them shows some interesting promise

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.160
 or effectiveness even in a limited context.

1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:28.280
 Before marching into this description

1:51:28.280 --> 1:51:29.860
 of these two compounds,

1:51:29.860 --> 1:51:32.200
 in fact, before even mentioning these two compounds,

1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.460
 I do want to emphasize what's been said

1:51:35.460 --> 1:51:37.480
 and written about over and over again,

1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:41.120
 and what was relayed to me from expert psychiatrists.

1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:45.720
 It is not wise to rely purely on talk therapy

1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:48.360
 or on natural approaches

1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:49.700
 to the treatment of bipolar disorder,

1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:52.680
 given the intensity of the disorder

1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:56.260
 and the high propensity for suicide risk

1:51:56.260 --> 1:51:57.820
 in people with bipolar disorder.

1:51:57.820 --> 1:52:00.600
 It is a chemical and neural circuit disruption,

1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:02.260
 and it needs to be dealt with head on

1:52:02.260 --> 1:52:05.020
 through the appropriate chemistry

1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:06.860
 and prescription drug approaches

1:52:06.860 --> 1:52:09.080
 from a board certified psychiatrist.

1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:11.320
 I don't say this to protect me.

1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:14.760
 I say this truly to protect those who either suffer from

1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:16.800
 or think they may suffer from bipolar disorder

1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:18.740
 if you know someone who you think might suffer

1:52:18.740 --> 1:52:19.980
 from bipolar disorder.

1:52:20.820 --> 1:52:22.600
 Now, all that is not to say

1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:24.960
 that there aren't useful lifestyle interventions

1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:26.840
 that can support people with bipolar disorder.

1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:28.460
 So I just briefly want to mention those.

1:52:28.460 --> 1:52:30.960
 And again, I'm lifting the statements I'm about to make

1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:33.760
 from some excellent online lectures

1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:36.480
 from psychiatrists at Stanford and elsewhere,

1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:41.480
 which essentially say that of course, of course, of course,

1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:45.120
 getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise,

1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:46.660
 getting proper nutrition,

1:52:46.660 --> 1:52:50.600
 having quality, healthy social interactions,

1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:52.400
 even getting regular sunlight in the day

1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:53.720
 and avoiding bright light at night,

1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:57.000
 all of those things are going to braid together

1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.880
 to support the nervous system

1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:02.360
 and the psyche of somebody with bipolar disorder,

1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.880
 but they braid together to support the psyche

1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:06.480
 and the neurochemistry and the neural circuits

1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:08.380
 of anybody and everybody.

1:53:08.380 --> 1:53:11.240
 So they have generally a modulatory effect.

1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:15.040
 That is they're indirectly shifting the likelihood

1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:17.200
 that somebody might have an episode

1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:19.240
 or the intensity of an episode,

1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:21.160
 in particular, the depressive episodes, right?

1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:22.000
 You can imagine how someone

1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.800
 who's heading into a depressive episode,

1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:25.560
 maybe they're on a lower amount of medication

1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:27.160
 or they haven't yet medicated

1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:29.200
 for the depressive episode of bipolar.

1:53:29.200 --> 1:53:31.400
 And now they're making sure,

1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:32.500
 or their family is making sure

1:53:32.500 --> 1:53:34.040
 that they're getting exercise, sunshine,

1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:36.780
 eating correctly, social engagement, et cetera.

1:53:36.780 --> 1:53:38.080
 Of course, it makes perfect sense

1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:41.380
 why they would have perhaps a shallower drop into depression

1:53:41.380 --> 1:53:43.920
 or maybe even offset a depressive episode.

1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:47.500
 That said, most all, if not all people

1:53:47.500 --> 1:53:49.840
 with bipolar disorder are likely to need

1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:52.620
 some sort of drug therapy intervention

1:53:52.620 --> 1:53:53.880
 in order to help them.

1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:56.800
 So lifestyle factors are always important

1:53:56.800 --> 1:53:58.280
 in all individuals,

1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:01.400
 those suffering from psychiatric conditions or not.

1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:05.460
 But in some conditions of the mind and body,

1:54:05.460 --> 1:54:08.140
 those lifestyle interventions can have a greater effect

1:54:08.140 --> 1:54:09.560
 in offsetting symptoms.

1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:11.240
 Whereas in bipolar disorder,

1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:13.540
 I think it's naive and in fact wrong

1:54:13.540 --> 1:54:16.320
 to say that lifestyle interventions alone

1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:18.800
 are going to prevent especially the extreme forms

1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:20.600
 of mania and depression.

1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:23.120
 Again, bipolar disorder being so serious

1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:25.420
 and carrying such high suicide risk,

1:54:25.420 --> 1:54:27.500
 we just have to point this out again and again.

1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:29.760
 Now, with that said, there are two substances

1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:31.840
 generally found as supplements,

1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:33.780
 although there are other sources of them as well,

1:54:33.780 --> 1:54:37.400
 including within nutritional sources that have been shown,

1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:39.760
 at least in some studies, to be pretty effective

1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:43.340
 in adjusting the symptoms of bipolar disorder.

1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:48.340
 And those two things are inositol and omega-3 fatty acids.

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:51.680
 Now, inositol is a compound

1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:53.400
 that is taken for a variety of reasons.

1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:55.440
 It's something we've talked about on the podcast before.

1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:56.760
 I personally take inositol

1:54:56.760 --> 1:54:58.120
 not because I have bipolar disorder.

1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:02.120
 In fact, I am quite lucky that I don't have bipolar disorder,

1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:05.240
 but I take inositol at 900 milligrams of myo-inositol

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:07.780
 every third night or so in order to improve my sleep.

1:55:07.780 --> 1:55:09.640
 It's something that I've added to my sleep stack.

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.400
 It's something that I found greatly enhances

1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:14.500
 the depth and quality of my sleep.

1:55:14.500 --> 1:55:16.100
 And if I wake up in the middle of the night

1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:17.360
 to use the bathroom, et cetera,

1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:20.620
 it's greatly enhanced my ability to fall back asleep

1:55:20.620 --> 1:55:22.000
 when I want to go back to sleep.

1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:25.880
 It also seems to have a fairly potent anti-anxiety effect

1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:26.800
 during the day.

1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:29.180
 And as I discussed in our episode

1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:30.780
 about obsessive compulsive disorder,

1:55:30.780 --> 1:55:34.040
 inositol has been used at high dosages.

1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:35.360
 Again, I should say myo-inositol

1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:37.680
 has been used at high dosages,

1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:40.320
 levels of even 10, 18 grams.

1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:42.440
 Those are massive dosages, by the way,

1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:46.680
 to deal with certain symptoms of OCD to limited success.

1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:48.360
 And I should mention that high dosages

1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:51.680
 of 10 or 18 grams of inositol

1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:54.480
 can cause a lot of gastric discomfort, et cetera.

1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:57.240
 If you want to learn more about inositol

1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:58.280
 and its various uses,

1:55:58.280 --> 1:56:00.920
 I encourage you to go to examine.com

1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:03.520
 where there's the so-called human effect matrix

1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:07.120
 and that human effects matrix will describe the many places

1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:10.000
 in which myo-inositol and other forms of inositol

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.400
 have been shown to be effective in, for instance,

1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:15.780
 reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep, and on and on.

1:56:15.780 --> 1:56:19.340
 Myo-inositol is important because myo-inositol,

1:56:19.340 --> 1:56:21.440
 and we can just say inositol,

1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:24.160
 is related to so-called second messenger pathways.

1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:25.000
 I don't want to get too deep

1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.240
 into second messenger pathways,

1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:29.680
 but when certain substances bind like neurotransmitters

1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:31.640
 to a receptor on a cell surface,

1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:34.180
 oftentimes those receptors themselves will open

1:56:34.180 --> 1:56:37.280
 and allow the passage of ions and other things into a cell.

1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:39.200
 Oftentimes they will engage

1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:41.000
 what are called second messenger systems.

1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.880
 That is, they will trigger mechanisms within the cell

1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:45.480
 to then go do other things.

1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:47.040
 This is probably something we should get into

1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:48.720
 in real detail in a future episode

1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:50.380
 for those of you that really want to nerd out

1:56:50.380 --> 1:56:53.440
 on cell-cell signaling, which is a favorite topic of mine.

1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:56.040
 In any case, inositol is related

1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:58.360
 to a number of so-called second messenger systems,

1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:01.400
 this handoff or this kind of stimulating

1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:05.500
 of changes within a cell that can inspire changes

1:57:05.500 --> 1:57:07.600
 in what's called a membrane fluidity,

1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:10.360
 can actually make the membranes of cells,

1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:12.860
 the outside fence around a cell,

1:57:12.860 --> 1:57:14.600
 which is made up of fatty stuff,

1:57:16.060 --> 1:57:17.520
 it can change the fluidity,

1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:21.680
 meaning how readily things can float around in the membrane.

1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:23.160
 We think of cells as very rigid,

1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:24.760
 like there's a cell, there's a neuron,

1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:25.980
 or there's a immune cell,

1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:29.840
 but actually those cells have a fatty outside,

1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:31.960
 in particular neurons have a fatty outside,

1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:33.480
 it's a thin fatty outside,

1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:35.380
 and it's called the cell membrane.

1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:37.820
 And things are floating around in that cell membrane,

1:57:37.820 --> 1:57:40.240
 but it's kind of like jello that hasn't quite fixed.

1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:43.360
 And so things like receptors moving into the synapse

1:57:43.360 --> 1:57:46.360
 or moving out of the synapse for homeostatic plasticity,

1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:50.720
 things like the ability for certain genes

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:52.560
 to be turned on in a cell or not turned on

1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:54.960
 can depend a lot on things that are happening

1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:55.920
 in that cell membrane

1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:58.340
 and how readily things move around in the cell membrane.

1:57:58.340 --> 1:57:59.920
 One way to think about this whole picture

1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:02.720
 of membrane fluidity is that just imagine

1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:05.040
 that every one of your cells has this layer,

1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:07.400
 it's kind of a gelatinous-like layer,

1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:10.660
 and there are lots of little rafts floating around in there,

1:58:10.660 --> 1:58:15.280
 but those rafts are able to move more quickly

1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:16.280
 from one place to another,

1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:18.520
 or get more stuck in one place or another,

1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:21.040
 depending on how set that jello is.

1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:26.040
 Inositol and lithium, and as we'll talk about next,

1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:30.000
 omega-3 fatty acids seem to change

1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.120
 the fluidity of those membranes.

1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:34.000
 In other words, they allow things to move

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.360
 in and out of those membranes more readily or not.

1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:40.320
 And this is no surprise,

1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:44.840
 given that those membranes are made out of fatty stuff.

1:58:44.840 --> 1:58:47.200
 In particular, the membranes of neurons

1:58:47.200 --> 1:58:49.240
 are called a lipid bilayer.

1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:54.240
 It's two layers of fat, okay, bi means two, lipid fat,

1:58:54.320 --> 1:58:57.000
 and omega-3 fatty acids of the sort

1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.240
 that are found in certain fish,

1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:01.500
 and fatty fish in particular,

1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:05.200
 and that are found in fish oil and cod liver oil, et cetera.

1:59:06.360 --> 1:59:09.080
 Omega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them,

1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:11.200
 are used for a lot of different things,

1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:14.580
 but they can be readily incorporated into pathways

1:59:14.580 --> 1:59:17.600
 or directly incorporated into cell membranes,

1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:19.680
 changing the way those cell membranes work,

1:59:19.680 --> 1:59:21.880
 and if those cell membranes are the cell membranes

1:59:21.880 --> 1:59:24.360
 of neurons, changing the way that neurons work.

1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:28.520
 So the ability for fish oil, and in particular,

1:59:28.520 --> 1:59:31.200
 the omega-3 fatty acids, which come in varieties

1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:34.100
 like EPA and DHA, we'll talk about that in a moment,

1:59:34.100 --> 1:59:36.800
 have been explored at relatively high dosages

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:41.520
 for their ability to offset some of the effects of mania

1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:44.860
 and to offset the effects of depressive episodes

1:59:44.860 --> 1:59:46.080
 in bipolar disorder.

1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:48.560
 And actually, the data there are pretty impressive,

1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:52.780
 although they are varied,

1:59:52.780 --> 1:59:55.320
 meaning you will find several studies,

1:59:55.320 --> 1:59:57.800
 and I'll mention a few, that found no effect

1:59:57.800 --> 2:00:00.080
 of omega-3 supplementation through fish oil.

2:00:00.080 --> 2:00:01.540
 Usually it's capsuled fish oil,

2:00:01.540 --> 2:00:04.760
 although fish oil can also be taken in liquid form.

2:00:04.760 --> 2:00:06.080
 Oftentimes, taking in liquid form

2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:07.800
 is the more cost-efficient way to do it.

2:00:07.800 --> 2:00:10.920
 Taking in capsule form is the more palatable way to do it,

2:00:10.920 --> 2:00:13.600
 because fish oil, for a lot of people, doesn't taste good.

2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:17.540
 But nonetheless, there are several studies that have shown

2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:21.560
 that supplementing with fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids

2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:25.040
 at levels of, for instance, four grams per day

2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:25.920
 for a period of time,

2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:27.660
 this is a study that we will link in the show notes.

2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:29.920
 This is Murphy et al. 2012.

2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:34.920
 This is a fatty acid supplementation of 70% EPA to DHA,

2:00:35.100 --> 2:00:37.560
 actually worsened symptoms of mania

2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:39.920
 over a period of about 16 weeks,

2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:42.040
 which on the face of it makes it seem like, okay,

2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:43.800
 omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,

2:00:43.800 --> 2:00:47.140
 very likely to not be good for bipolar disorder.

2:00:47.140 --> 2:00:50.440
 And yet, that was the manic phase.

2:00:50.440 --> 2:00:52.120
 When one looks at some of the other studies

2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:54.700
 of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,

2:00:54.700 --> 2:00:58.080
 there is, for instance, a study published in 1999.

2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:01.200
 This is a much higher dosage supplementation

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:02.320
 with omega-3 fatty acid.

2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:06.800
 This is a 9.6 grams of fish oil per day for four months.

2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:10.320
 And that actually greatly reduced symptoms

2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:14.800
 of bipolar depression compared to the control group,

2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:16.280
 which received olive oil.

2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:18.080
 Olive oil is a different form of fat,

2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:19.520
 monounsaturated fat,

2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:22.320
 but doesn't contain as much of the omega-3 fatty acids

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:23.140
 and so forth.

2:01:23.140 --> 2:01:27.440
 So 9.6 grams of fish oil per day over four months

2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:31.580
 is a lot of fish oil to be ingesting on a given day.

2:01:31.580 --> 2:01:33.920
 This was a double-blind study.

2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:36.760
 This was only carried out, I should mention, in 30 subjects,

2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:38.400
 but it was males and females.

2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:39.880
 And the age range was pretty broad,

2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:42.520
 anywhere from 18 all the way up to 64 years of age,

2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:45.460
 which is important given the sort of longitudinal

2:01:45.460 --> 2:01:49.040
 or changes over time that one sees in bipolar disorder.

2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:50.840
 Here's the major takeaway.

2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:52.840
 Supplementing with high-dose omega-3s

2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:56.040
 does seem to be beneficial for a good number of people

2:01:56.040 --> 2:01:57.600
 with bipolar disorder.

2:01:57.600 --> 2:01:59.260
 However, again, I want to highlight,

2:01:59.260 --> 2:02:01.560
 however, it should not be viewed

2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:04.560
 as the only treatment approach for bipolar disorder.

2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:06.360
 This goes back to what I was saying before

2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:09.080
 about the essential need in most every case

2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:12.360
 for high potency prescription drug treatments

2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.120
 prescribed by a board-certified psychiatrist

2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:15.000
 for bipolar disorder.

2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:19.840
 However, omega-3 supplementation does seem to improve

2:02:20.780 --> 2:02:22.480
 or reduce the depressive symptoms

2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:24.400
 in the major depressive episodes of bipolar.

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:25.880
 And there are a couple of studies,

2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:27.880
 and we'll link to these in the show notes as well,

2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:29.640
 that show that it may even improve

2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:31.980
 some of the manic episodes as well,

2:02:31.980 --> 2:02:34.880
 meaning it reduces some of the manic symptoms.

2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:38.080
 Now, I say all this from a place of great caution

2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:41.160
 because I know, especially for listeners of this podcast,

2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:42.920
 there's a lot of interest in the behavioral tools,

2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:44.560
 the supplement-based tools, the nutrition tools

2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:46.280
 that can support bipolar disorder.

2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:48.600
 But I don't think I can overemphasize enough

2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:50.560
 that especially for bipolar disorder

2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:53.080
 and the great risk of suicide and suffering

2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:55.120
 and inappropriate spending,

2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:57.480
 or I should say maladaptive spending and impulsivity

2:02:57.480 --> 2:02:59.300
 that's associated with bipolar disorder,

2:02:59.300 --> 2:03:01.360
 that it's hard to imagine a scenario

2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:03.440
 in which just talk therapy and fish oil

2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:06.840
 and lifestyle interventions are going to completely suppress

2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:08.280
 or treat bipolar disorder.

2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:10.840
 People with bipolar disorder really need to consider

2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:13.840
 the full picture of treatments, the drug treatments,

2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:18.160
 the talk therapy treatments and lifestyle treatments

2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:22.800
 and nutraceutical, or we can say supplement-based treatments

2:03:22.800 --> 2:03:24.800
 such as omega-3 supplementation,

2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:28.040
 as a full and necessary picture

2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:29.880
 for dealing with their illness.

2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:32.400
 I'd be remiss, however, if I didn't emphasize

2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:35.600
 that the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation

2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:36.880
 is very interesting,

2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:40.240
 not just in terms of the subjective effects,

2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:41.760
 people saying they feel less depressed

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:42.760
 or able to sleep better,

2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:45.160
 or maybe even some reduction in manic symptoms.

2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:47.080
 There's actually been some really good brain imaging

2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:50.600
 to try and understand how omega-3 fatty acid treatments

2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:53.100
 are actually changing the brains and neural circuits

2:03:53.100 --> 2:03:54.040
 of people with bipolar.

2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:55.320
 And I will put a reference to this.

2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:56.840
 This is a paper that was published

2:03:56.840 --> 2:03:58.760
 in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:00.920
 It's entitled Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment

2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:05.780
 and T2 Whole-Brain Relaxation Times in Bipolar Disorder.

2:04:05.780 --> 2:04:08.140
 I don't have the opportunity to go into a lot of detail

2:04:08.140 --> 2:04:11.120
 right now about what T2 whole-brain relaxation times are,

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.880
 but basically when people go into a MRI

2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:16.340
 or F, functional MRI scanner,

2:04:16.340 --> 2:04:21.340
 magnetic resonance imaging scanner,

2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:23.360
 what they're getting essentially

2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:25.800
 is pulses of magnetic fields.

2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:28.520
 And the way that brain structures and neural activity

2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:30.080
 can be evaluated has a lot to do

2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:33.040
 with the sort of spinning or not sort of,

2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:36.040
 it has to do with the spinning and the relaxation times

2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:38.340
 of different elements,

2:04:38.340 --> 2:04:41.720
 literally the protons and electrons within the neuron.

2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:43.720
 So it gets really detailed there.

2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:46.200
 And the relaxation time is essentially looking

2:04:46.200 --> 2:04:49.960
 at how quickly some of that spinning returns to rest.

2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:54.960
 And in particular, the fact that the relaxation times

2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:58.420
 are different for aqueous, that is liquid,

2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:03.060
 versus lipid, fatty, versus other components of brain tissue.

2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:05.120
 And basically what this study shows

2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:08.780
 is that the membranes of neurons within the brains

2:05:08.780 --> 2:05:10.560
 of these people with bipolar disorder

2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:12.740
 showed more fluidity, more ability of things

2:05:12.740 --> 2:05:14.940
 to move in and around the membranes,

2:05:14.940 --> 2:05:16.760
 which we know is an important component

2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:20.080
 of neuroplasticity in bipolar subjects

2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:22.520
 that were treated with omega-3 fatty acids

2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:24.380
 as compared to bipolar subjects

2:05:24.380 --> 2:05:27.320
 that did not receive omega-3 fatty acids.

2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:29.480
 And fortunately, this study also include

2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:31.220
 a healthy comparison group

2:05:31.220 --> 2:05:32.880
 where they could essentially find

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:34.760
 that people with bipolar disorder

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:36.160
 who supplemented with omega-3s

2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:38.560
 had changes at the cellular level

2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:40.320
 and the neural circuit level

2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:43.280
 that brought their brains and neural circuits

2:05:43.280 --> 2:05:46.300
 closer to that of the healthy comparison subjects.

2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:48.640
 So while I don't want to point

2:05:48.640 --> 2:05:50.680
 to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation

2:05:50.680 --> 2:05:53.040
 as the be all end all of treatment for bipolar disorder,

2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:54.280
 certainly it is not,

2:05:54.280 --> 2:05:57.660
 it does have a strong mechanistic basis

2:05:57.660 --> 2:06:02.660
 for its possible support of neural circuitry,

2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:05.360
 of neuroplasticity, and in particular,

2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:07.480
 the ability to make changes in cell membranes

2:06:07.480 --> 2:06:09.680
 that are very reminiscent

2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:11.320
 of some of the neural circuit changes

2:06:11.320 --> 2:06:12.920
 and changes in membrane fluidity

2:06:12.920 --> 2:06:14.700
 that are seen with lithium treatment

2:06:14.700 --> 2:06:17.300
 and other known prescription drug treatments

2:06:17.300 --> 2:06:20.240
 that have been established now for decades

2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:22.960
 to be very effective for bipolar disorder.

2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:26.440
 So what that says is that omega-3 supplementation,

2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:30.000
 while not the only intervention that one should consider,

2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:33.080
 is something to consider and talk about with your doctor.

2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:35.640
 And it's operating in powerful ways.

2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:38.200
 It's not just that it's changing, for instance,

2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:40.320
 your gut microbiome, which is powerful,

2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:41.520
 but is indirect to the brain.

2:06:41.520 --> 2:06:43.180
 It does seem to be having direct effects

2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:44.900
 on neurons and neural circuits.

2:06:44.900 --> 2:06:46.520
 Before we begin to conclude our discussion

2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:48.160
 about bipolar disorder,

2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:51.000
 I want to talk a little bit about this word disorder.

2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:52.920
 And this is a theme that doesn't just relate

2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:54.280
 to bipolar disorder,

2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:57.000
 but other psychiatric disorders as well.

2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.720
 And when we think of a disorder,

2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:02.080
 we think of something that is really detrimental to us,

2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:04.560
 something that really impairs our ability

2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:06.760
 to function in work and school and relationships

2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:10.060
 and really starts to pull down our health status

2:07:10.060 --> 2:07:11.160
 in a variety of ways.

2:07:11.160 --> 2:07:14.920
 And certainly bipolar disorder meets those criteria.

2:07:14.920 --> 2:07:17.800
 However, there is this idea

2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:19.740
 that things like bipolar disorder,

2:07:19.740 --> 2:07:22.640
 even things like schizophrenia in some cases,

2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:25.560
 are responsible for some of the creative aspects

2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:27.840
 or the creative works that have been observed

2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:31.120
 and carried out by human beings for many centuries.

2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:32.160
 And believe it or not,

2:07:32.160 --> 2:07:34.160
 there are good data to support the fact

2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:36.360
 that certain aspects of mania

2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:38.860
 are associated with creativity.

2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:42.240
 Now, we are long overdue for an episode about creativity,

2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:44.180
 its neural circuit basis, its chemical basis,

2:07:44.180 --> 2:07:45.800
 here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:48.260
 And certainly we will have that conversation.

2:07:48.260 --> 2:07:49.440
 But in the meantime,

2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:52.080
 I'd like to just briefly touch upon this idea

2:07:52.080 --> 2:07:54.880
 that certain occupations are associated

2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:57.840
 with a higher incidence of bipolar depression.

2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:02.160
 And in fact, it's been explored at a research level.

2:08:02.160 --> 2:08:04.560
 Really, there are data pointed to the fact

2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:07.800
 that certain individuals of certain occupations

2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:09.520
 tend to be more creative

2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:11.640
 and that creativity is associated with,

2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:13.720
 again, associated, this isn't causal,

2:08:13.720 --> 2:08:16.900
 it's associated or correlated with higher levels

2:08:16.900 --> 2:08:19.080
 or incidents of bipolar depression

2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:21.120
 and maybe even other forms of depression.

2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:24.240
 So this is a study looking at mood disorders

2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:25.840
 in eminent individuals.

2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:28.960
 So these are people that are not just good at what they do,

2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:30.960
 but are exceptional at what they do

2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:35.680
 and explored the percentage of people in given professions

2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:39.040
 with either depression or mania.

2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:41.440
 And this was actually a data set gleaned

2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:45.140
 from more than 1,000 20th century Westerners

2:08:45.140 --> 2:08:46.660
 based on their biographies

2:08:46.660 --> 2:08:49.060
 that were reviewed by other people.

2:08:49.060 --> 2:08:50.600
 So it's a bit of an indirect measurement.

2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:52.600
 This isn't psychiatrist data.

2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:55.760
 This is data, or I should say these are data

2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:59.360
 that were compiled from self-reports

2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:02.180
 or from reads of self-reports.

2:09:02.180 --> 2:09:03.900
 And they explored a number of different professions.

2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:06.520
 So for instance, they looked at people in the military

2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:08.480
 or people who were professional athletes

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:11.100
 or natural scientists or social scientists,

2:09:11.100 --> 2:09:13.400
 people who occupied positions in public office

2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.240
 or were musical performers, artists, nonfiction writers,

2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:18.620
 poetry, et cetera.

2:09:18.620 --> 2:09:20.260
 There are a lot of professions here.

2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:22.720
 I will post this, or I'll post a link to it

2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:25.000
 in the show note captions for you to peruse,

2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.120
 but I'll just give you a sense of the extremes

2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:29.440
 on this graph because they're very interesting.

2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:32.520
 It turns out that if you were to look at the profession,

2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:34.120
 or I should say among the professions

2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:35.540
 that they looked at in this study,

2:09:35.540 --> 2:09:38.220
 cause they didn't look at all professions,

2:09:38.220 --> 2:09:42.020
 those in the military and those who are professional athletes

2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:46.680
 or had jobs in the social or natural sciences had the,

2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:49.720
 of those, there was a lower percentage of those

2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:52.000
 that had depression or mania.

2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:53.920
 In some cases like those who were professional athletes

2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:56.440
 didn't seem to have, there was no incidents of mania,

2:09:56.440 --> 2:09:58.200
 at least in this data set.

2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:00.600
 Whereas at the opposite extreme of the graph,

2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.240
 those that were poets, so these are eminent individuals,

2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:06.080
 people that were exceptional poets,

2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:09.400
 exceptional fiction writers, exceptional artists

2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:11.360
 or nonfiction writers.

2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:14.120
 Well, they're especially for the poets.

2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:19.120
 You find that as many as 90% of these very successful poets

2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:25.520
 had either depression or mania, as high as 90%.

2:10:26.300 --> 2:10:27.240
 That's incredible.

2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:30.280
 Contrast that with military, where it's as few as 10%

2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:32.520
 or professional athletes, where it's as few as 20%

2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:34.600
 and for the professional athletes, as I mentioned before,

2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:36.260
 none of them had mania.

2:10:36.260 --> 2:10:39.080
 So does this mean that being a poet

2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:40.640
 will make you manic or depressed?

2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:43.360
 Well, first of all, let's look at the poetry category.

2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:47.960
 It turns out that 75% of these eminent poets,

2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:51.820
 these highly accomplished poets had major depression.

2:10:52.680 --> 2:10:57.680
 Whereas only about 20% of those poets had manic episodes.

2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:02.720
 So again, it's not that being a poet

2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:04.640
 is going to give you mania, certainly we're not saying that,

2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:06.480
 it's not that being a poet is going to give you depression,

2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:09.640
 but it turns out that people with depression

2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:12.260
 and people with depression and mania

2:11:12.260 --> 2:11:14.200
 seem to gravitate towards poetry

2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:16.480
 or at least are very successful at poetry.

2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:20.000
 Again, associative, correlative,

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.520
 no causal relationship here,

2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:24.920
 but it is really striking to see how

2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:29.200
 the creative occupations, poetry, fiction, art,

2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:30.360
 nonfiction writing,

2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:32.160
 even though nonfiction writing is about nonfiction,

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:35.000
 it's still creative, music, composition, theater,

2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.640
 much higher incidents of things like mania.

2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:41.040
 And in fact, for the people in theater, the actors,

2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:44.880
 even though the overall occurrence of depression and mania

2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:47.240
 is lower than that in poets,

2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:51.000
 the fraction of those individuals that have mania

2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:52.560
 is exceedingly high.

2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:55.320
 It's about 30% of those that they looked at

2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:01.320
 who are actors have manic episodes or have full-blown mania.

2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:04.900
 So I'm referring to these data because first of all,

2:12:04.900 --> 2:12:06.760
 I find them incredibly interesting, right?

2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:08.680
 Up until now, we've been talking about bipolar disorder

2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:11.680
 and other mood disorders for their maladaptive effects.

2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:13.360
 And again, they're extremely maladaptive,

2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:16.460
 much, much higher instance of suicide, et cetera.

2:12:16.460 --> 2:12:19.020
 But we'd be wrong to say that certain aspects

2:12:19.020 --> 2:12:22.000
 of manic episodes don't lend themselves well to creativity

2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:23.900
 or that certain aspects of major depression

2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:26.960
 don't lend themselves well to creativity

2:12:26.960 --> 2:12:29.320
 or to the performing arts or to poetry.

2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:32.920
 That said, in no way, shape, or form,

2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:36.280
 do I believe that being depressed is a good thing

2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:37.880
 or that being manic is a good thing.

2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:40.940
 Again, we return to the basic foundational criteria

2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:42.500
 for bipolar disorder and major depression,

2:12:42.500 --> 2:12:46.960
 which is that the pressured speech, the not sleeping,

2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.760
 the incredible increases in energy and the flights of ideas

2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:54.200
 are generally not going to lead,

2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.060
 or I think it's fair to say

2:12:56.060 --> 2:12:58.160
 are not going to lead to good places.

2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:00.840
 In fact, often lead to bad places.

2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:04.140
 But we would also be wrong if we didn't consider the fact

2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:07.720
 that there is a somewhat inextricable relationship

2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:10.080
 between mania and creativity.

2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:15.080
 And it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania,

2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:17.480
 maybe even an hour a day or 30 minutes a day

2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:19.520
 of composing or writing poetry,

2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:21.960
 maybe even some of the lows that we feel,

2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:23.520
 some of the sadness, some of the grief,

2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:25.200
 some of the nostalgia that we feel,

2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:27.280
 provided that it's not pathologic,

2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:30.240
 that it's not persistent for the four or seven days

2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:32.400
 that are diagnostic of bipolar II

2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:34.480
 and bipolar I disorder respectively.

2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:38.080
 Well, then we can start to view emotional states

2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:40.360
 as something that can actually lend themselves

2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:43.480
 to positive outcomes and maybe even to creativity

2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:45.220
 and to improved occupations.

2:13:45.220 --> 2:13:47.520
 So it's important that we have a nuanced view

2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:50.580
 of what sadness versus depression

2:13:50.580 --> 2:13:52.360
 versus major depression are.

2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:57.000
 It's important that we distinguish between being erratic,

2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:00.760
 being very energized and full-blown bipolar disorder.

2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:02.760
 And I raise this for another reason as well.

2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:05.600
 Nowadays, it's very common to hear people saying,

2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:07.600
 oh, you know, that person is OCD.

2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:11.940
 Well, on the episode about OCD that I did a few weeks back,

2:14:11.940 --> 2:14:15.120
 that you can find if you like at hubermanlab.com,

2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:18.700
 in that episode, I pointed out that OCD,

2:14:18.700 --> 2:14:21.780
 obsessive compulsive disorder, is very maladaptive, right?

2:14:21.780 --> 2:14:23.880
 I think it's number seven, as I recall,

2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:26.100
 on the list of debilitating diseases,

2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:29.160
 all diseases in terms of lost time at work,

2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:30.840
 suffering relationships, et cetera.

2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:33.680
 So it's a really serious condition, and yet we often hear,

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:35.040
 oh, that person is obsessive.

2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:36.360
 And as I pointed out,

2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:38.780
 there is obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:14:38.780 --> 2:14:41.520
 and then there is obsessive compulsive tendencies

2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:43.280
 which actually benefit people.

2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:46.720
 But that is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder

2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:49.440
 as a clinically diagnosed thing.

2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:53.080
 Similarly, we hear that, oh, somebody's being bipolar,

2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:55.120
 you know, they're all over the place, they're bipolar.

2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:58.920
 Well, that's a very subjective and kind of label

2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:01.840
 that people give one another in passing.

2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:03.240
 More and more often I'm hearing this,

2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:08.020
 and yet bipolar disorder, whether or not it's BP1 or BP2,

2:15:08.020 --> 2:15:12.440
 are extremely maladaptive and extremely associated

2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:14.380
 with high suicide risk.

2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:17.480
 So while I'm not here to police people,

2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:18.720
 I'm certainly not the word police

2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:20.280
 or the nomenclature police,

2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:23.160
 I do think that whether or not you refer to people as OCD

2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.240
 or as bipolar, et cetera, that's up to you, all right?

2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:26.480
 It's not my place to say,

2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:27.940
 but I do think it's important

2:15:27.940 --> 2:15:30.920
 that all of us understand that these psychiatric conditions

2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:33.840
 carry with them tremendous maladaptive weight.

2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:35.960
 So today we've really done a deep dive

2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:39.420
 into bipolar disorder and to both the manic

2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:42.700
 and the depressive components that are present

2:15:42.700 --> 2:15:44.960
 or can be present in bipolar disorder

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:46.960
 and the different forms of bipolar disorder

2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:49.800
 and some of the major treatments for bipolar disorder,

2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:52.200
 in particular lithium and its underlying mechanisms

2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:54.520
 and some of the neural circuit and chemical basis

2:15:54.520 --> 2:15:57.600
 and neuroplasticity basis of the treatments

2:15:57.600 --> 2:15:59.220
 for bipolar disorder,

2:15:59.220 --> 2:16:01.640
 in particular homeostatic scaling

2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:03.780
 or homeostatic plasticity.

2:16:03.780 --> 2:16:06.600
 All of that, of course, is relevant to bipolar disorder

2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:08.720
 and I hope will be useful in your understanding

2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:10.360
 and maybe even in your pursuit of treatments

2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:11.920
 for bipolar depression,

2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:14.240
 bipolar disorder for you or other people.

2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:16.980
 I also hope that it will be useful in your understanding

2:16:16.980 --> 2:16:19.880
 of how brain circuits work in normal conditions

2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:22.240
 or in conditions where there is no disease state

2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:23.840
 or maladaptive conditions.

2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:27.460
 Homeostatic plasticity is present in all of us.

2:16:27.460 --> 2:16:31.140
 Membrane fluidity due to how easily things move around

2:16:31.140 --> 2:16:33.920
 in the surface, the fatty layers on the outside of neurons

2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:35.900
 and the movement of receptors in and out of neurons,

2:16:35.900 --> 2:16:37.560
 that is present in all of us.

2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:39.680
 The influence of omega-3 fatty acids

2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:41.960
 is central to that discussion,

2:16:41.960 --> 2:16:44.600
 as is the discussion about various drug treatments

2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:45.660
 because even if you're not somebody

2:16:45.660 --> 2:16:47.340
 who's taking a drug treatment

2:16:47.340 --> 2:16:49.840
 or who is pursuing a drug treatment for bipolar disorder

2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:51.720
 or another psychiatric condition,

2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:53.720
 your serotonin levels, your dopamine levels,

2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:54.680
 your acetylcholine levels,

2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:56.080
 all of these play into what we call

2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:57.800
 your mental and physical health.

2:16:57.800 --> 2:16:59.200
 In fact, if any of you are interested

2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:01.560
 in the various categories of neuromodulators

2:17:01.560 --> 2:17:04.020
 and tools to adjust those neuromodulators

2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:06.860
 under more standard non-disease conditions,

2:17:06.860 --> 2:17:10.900
 we did an episode on neurochemicals and how to control them.

2:17:10.900 --> 2:17:12.800
 You can find that at hubermanlab.com

2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:15.640
 along with all other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:17.320
 I should mention everything is timestamped

2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:18.920
 so you can navigate to the specific topics

2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:20.720
 and tools of interest to you.

2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:23.400
 And meanwhile, I just want to thank all of you

2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:27.140
 for joining me on this voyage through the biology

2:17:27.140 --> 2:17:29.180
 and the treatments for bipolar disorder.

2:17:29.180 --> 2:17:31.440
 I do hope you found it beneficial

2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:33.320
 both for yourself and for others.

2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:35.400
 I just want to remind people that bipolar disorder

2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:37.520
 is an extremely serious condition.

2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:39.660
 If you suspect that you have bipolar disorder

2:17:39.660 --> 2:17:41.840
 or you know somebody who does,

2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:43.560
 please make sure that you or they

2:17:43.560 --> 2:17:45.540
 talk to a qualified health professional.

2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:20.360
 During today's episode and certainly

 on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:24.240
 we talk about supplements.

2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:25.600
 Once again, while supplements

2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:26.940
 aren't necessary for everybody,

2:18:26.940 --> 2:18:28.800
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:30.760
 for things like enhancing sleep and focus

2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:32.800
 and hormone support and other aspects

2:18:32.800 --> 2:18:35.160
 of mental and physical health and performance.

2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:36.880
 As I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,

2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:38.740
 the Huberman Lab Podcast is happy to announce

2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:40.720
 that we partnered with Momentous Supplements.

2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:42.100
 If you'd like to see our supplements

2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:44.360
 and the ones that we designed in concert with Momentous,

2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:47.780
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:18:47.780 --> 2:18:50.440
 Please also check out Huberman Lab on social media.

2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:53.240
 We are Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.

2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:56.200
 In both places, I cover science and science related tools,

2:18:56.200 --> 2:18:57.740
 some of which overlaps with the content

2:18:57.740 --> 2:18:59.240
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:01.620
 but much of which is distinct from the information covered

2:19:01.620 --> 2:19:03.120
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:04.460
 We also have a newsletter.

2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:06.560
 It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:07.840
 It's completely zero cost

2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:10.120
 and it contains summaries of podcasts

2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:12.240
 and some actionable protocols from each podcast.

2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:14.520
 You can sign up for it by going to HubermanLab.com,

2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:17.440
 go to the menu and click on Neural Network Newsletter.

2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:18.640
 You can also see some examples

2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:20.220
 of previous newsletters there.

2:19:20.220 --> 2:19:21.960
 I should mention that by signing up,

2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:23.200
 you do provide your email,

2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:25.160
 but we do not share your email with anybody.

2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:27.320
 And again, it is completely zero cost.

2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:28.980
 So once again, thank you for joining me today

2:19:28.980 --> 2:19:30.680
 for our discussion about the biology

2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:32.200
 and treatment of bipolar disorder.

2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:34.520
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:36.320
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:51.320
 And I'll see you in the next one.
