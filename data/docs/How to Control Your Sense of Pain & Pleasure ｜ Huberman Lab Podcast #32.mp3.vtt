00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.020
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.020 --> 00:15.200
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.660
 Today, we continue our discussion of the senses,

00:18.660 --> 00:20.880
 and the senses we are going to discuss

00:20.880 --> 00:23.500
 are pain and pleasure.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.380
 Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum,

00:27.380 --> 00:32.180
 a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin,

00:32.180 --> 00:34.740
 and the perception, the understanding

00:34.740 --> 00:37.260
 of what those events are.

00:37.260 --> 00:40.460
 Our skin is our largest sensory organ,

00:40.460 --> 00:42.620
 and our largest organ indeed.

00:42.620 --> 00:46.180
 It is much larger than any of the other organs in our body,

00:46.180 --> 00:48.340
 and it's an odd organ if you think about it.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.160
 It has so many functions.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.400
 It acts as a barrier between our organs

00:52.400 --> 00:54.180
 and the outside world.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.580
 It harbors neurons, nerve cells,

00:56.580 --> 01:00.220
 that allow us to detect things like light touch

01:00.220 --> 01:03.860
 or temperature or pressure of various kinds.

01:03.860 --> 01:06.860
 And it's an organ that we hang ornaments on.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.200
 People put earrings in their ears.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.500
 People decorate their skin with tattoos

01:12.500 --> 01:14.720
 and inks and other things.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.900
 And it's an organ that allows us to experience

01:17.900 --> 01:21.720
 either great pain or great pleasure.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.800
 So it's a multifaceted organ,

01:23.800 --> 01:26.580
 and it's one that our brain needs to make sense of

01:26.580 --> 01:27.980
 in a multifaceted way.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.900
 So today we're going to discuss all that,

01:29.900 --> 01:34.520
 and most importantly, how you can experience more pleasure

01:34.520 --> 01:37.500
 and less pain by understanding these pathways.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.140
 We will also discuss things you can do,

01:40.140 --> 01:42.760
 and if you wish, things you can take

01:42.760 --> 01:45.700
 that will allow you to experience more pleasure

01:45.700 --> 01:47.180
 and less pain in response

01:47.180 --> 01:49.980
 to a variety of different experiences.

01:49.980 --> 01:51.300
 Before I go any further,

01:51.300 --> 01:54.780
 I want to highlight a particularly exciting area of science

01:54.780 --> 01:58.580
 that relates to the skin and to sensing of pleasure and pain

01:58.580 --> 02:01.980
 but has everything to do with motivation.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.540
 Motivation is something that many people struggle with.

02:05.540 --> 02:10.260
 Not everybody, but most people experience dips

02:10.260 --> 02:12.420
 and peaks in their motivation,

02:12.420 --> 02:14.340
 even if they really want something.

02:14.340 --> 02:16.900
 How should we think about these changes in motivation?

02:16.900 --> 02:18.500
 What do they reflect?

02:18.500 --> 02:20.100
 Well, at a very basic level,

02:20.100 --> 02:22.300
 they reflect fluctuations,

02:22.300 --> 02:26.180
 changes in the levels of a chemical called dopamine.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.420
 Most of us have heard of dopamine.

02:28.420 --> 02:30.300
 Dopamine is a neuromodulator,

02:30.300 --> 02:32.720
 meaning it modulates or changes the way

02:32.720 --> 02:35.380
 that neurons, nerve cells, work.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.560
 Most of us have heard that dopamine

02:37.560 --> 02:39.780
 is the molecule of pleasure.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.860
 However, that is incorrect.

02:41.860 --> 02:46.660
 Dopamine is a molecule of motivation and anticipation.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.740
 To illustrate how dopamine works,

02:49.740 --> 02:52.180
 I want to highlight some very important work

02:52.180 --> 02:54.380
 largely carried out by the laboratory

02:54.380 --> 02:56.380
 of a guy named Wolfram Schultz.

02:56.380 --> 02:59.400
 The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens

02:59.400 --> 03:03.060
 of excellent experiments on the dopamine system

03:03.060 --> 03:04.720
 and have identified something called

03:04.720 --> 03:07.360
 reward prediction error.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.200
 Although in some sense,

03:08.200 --> 03:12.060
 you can think about it as reward prediction variance,

03:12.060 --> 03:13.780
 changes in the levels of dopamine

03:13.780 --> 03:16.900
 depending on whether or not you expect a reward

03:16.900 --> 03:18.660
 and whether or not you get the reward.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.560
 So I'm going to make this very simple.

03:21.940 --> 03:25.380
 Dopamine is released into the brain and body

03:25.380 --> 03:28.860
 and generally makes us feel activated and motivated

03:28.860 --> 03:32.380
 and as if we have energy to pursue a goal.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.820
 And it is released into the brain and body

03:34.820 --> 03:37.380
 in anticipation of a reward.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.060
 Measurements of dopamine have been made

03:39.060 --> 03:40.560
 in animals and humans.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.900
 What you find is that when we anticipate a reward,

03:44.900 --> 03:46.640
 dopamine is released.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.300
 We will put in the work to achieve that reward.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.740
 That work could be mental work or physical work,

03:51.740 --> 03:54.460
 but when the reward arrives,

03:54.460 --> 03:57.320
 dopamine levels drop back down to baseline.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.160
 That's right.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.200
 When we receive a reward,

03:59.200 --> 04:02.460
 dopamine levels go back down to baseline.

04:02.460 --> 04:05.140
 So the way to envision this is you can just imagine

04:05.140 --> 04:08.000
 a sort of increase in dopamine as we anticipate something,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.660
 we're working towards it, we're working towards a goal,

04:10.660 --> 04:13.460
 we're excited about seeing somebody or meeting somebody

04:13.460 --> 04:15.400
 or receiving some reward,

04:15.400 --> 04:18.540
 and then the reward comes and dopamine goes down.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.860
 Now that's all fine and good,

04:20.860 --> 04:23.400
 but there is a way to get much more dopamine

04:23.400 --> 04:26.300
 out of that process and therefore a way

04:26.300 --> 04:29.280
 to have much more motivation, energy, and focus,

04:29.280 --> 04:33.380
 because those are the consequences of elevated dopamine.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.980
 The way to do that is to not deliver the reward

04:37.980 --> 04:40.100
 on an expected schedule.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.580
 So experiments have been done

04:41.580 --> 04:45.120
 where there's an anticipation of a reward, there's work,

04:45.120 --> 04:47.940
 and then the reward only arrives every other

04:47.940 --> 04:50.620
 or every third bout of work, okay?

04:50.620 --> 04:53.580
 So this would be like getting a pat on the head

04:53.580 --> 04:56.940
 if you're a dog or perhaps a child or an adult,

04:56.940 --> 05:00.920
 or getting a monetary reward only for every third project

05:00.920 --> 05:03.500
 or every third race that you win.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.360
 Pick any kind of goal, it doesn't matter.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.580
 These molecules don't care about what you're pursuing.

05:07.580 --> 05:11.720
 They are a common currency of different types of activities.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.160
 That's a regular reward schedule,

05:14.160 --> 05:17.020
 and it will not alter the pattern of dopamine release

05:17.020 --> 05:18.660
 that I described before.

05:18.660 --> 05:23.420
 However, if the reward arrives intermittently,

05:23.420 --> 05:28.020
 almost randomly, so you anticipate a reward as a maybe,

05:28.020 --> 05:29.700
 it might come, it might come.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.900
 Then you work, work, work, work, work, no reward.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.240
 You repeat the work, work, work, work, work, work,

05:35.240 --> 05:36.260
 and then you get a reward.

05:36.260 --> 05:38.580
 So some trials you do, some trials you don't,

05:38.580 --> 05:41.140
 and it's completely random.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.620
 Under those conditions, the amplitude,

05:43.620 --> 05:46.560
 the amount of dopamine that's released into your system,

05:46.560 --> 05:49.900
 and the motivation to continue working hard

05:49.900 --> 05:52.500
 or playing whatever kind of game you're playing,

05:52.500 --> 05:54.180
 doubles or triples.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.340
 And this is the basis of things like slot machines

05:56.340 --> 05:58.820
 and gambling, and this is why so many people

05:58.820 --> 06:02.740
 will give so much of their money up to casinos,

06:02.740 --> 06:05.860
 and the casinos always win.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.660
 Sometimes people walk away with more money

06:07.660 --> 06:09.400
 than they came to the casino with,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.740
 but the vast majority of the time,

06:11.740 --> 06:13.580
 the house wins, as they say.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.140
 And it's because they understand

06:15.140 --> 06:16.600
 intermittent reward schedules.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.080
 And you can apply this to stay motivated

06:19.080 --> 06:21.120
 in your own pursuits.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.500
 Rather than thinking about the pleasure of a reward,

06:24.500 --> 06:27.500
 understand that dopamine is released

06:27.500 --> 06:30.380
 in response to anticipation of a reward,

06:30.380 --> 06:33.360
 and that is the fuel for work.

06:33.360 --> 06:38.020
 And every once in a while at random, remove the reward.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.100
 That's the way to continue to stay motivated,

06:40.100 --> 06:43.500
 not to reward every action or every goal,

06:43.500 --> 06:47.140
 and this is also true if you're trying to train up children

06:47.140 --> 06:49.740
 or train up players on a team,

06:49.740 --> 06:52.300
 you should not celebrate every win.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.920
 I know that's a little counterintuitive.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.740
 We're going to go more into the biology of dopamine

06:57.740 --> 06:59.680
 and how it relates to the pleasure system

06:59.680 --> 07:01.140
 later on in the podcast.

07:01.140 --> 07:05.100
 But for now, understand intermittent reward schedules,

07:05.100 --> 07:07.220
 harness the biology of dopamine

07:07.220 --> 07:08.820
 in ways that can allow you

07:08.820 --> 07:12.480
 essentially infinite motivation over time.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.580
 Before I go any further,

07:13.580 --> 07:15.740
 I want to acknowledge that this podcast is separate

07:15.740 --> 07:18.100
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.180
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

07:20.180 --> 07:22.580
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

07:22.580 --> 07:24.740
 about science and science-related tools

07:24.740 --> 07:26.180
 to the general public.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.340
 In keeping with that theme,

07:27.340 --> 07:30.380
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.340
 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

07:33.340 --> 07:35.860
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:35.860 --> 07:38.500
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

07:38.500 --> 07:40.340
 to help you better understand your body

07:40.340 --> 07:42.580
 and help you reach your health goals.

07:42.580 --> 07:46.260
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:46.260 --> 07:49.900
 for the simple reason that many, if not all of the factors

07:49.900 --> 07:52.340
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

07:52.340 --> 07:55.220
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.480
 And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,

07:57.480 --> 07:59.880
 you can get further knowledge into the mechanisms

07:59.880 --> 08:01.040
 that are going on in your body

08:01.040 --> 08:02.900
 and how those mechanisms are changing

08:02.900 --> 08:05.220
 as they relate to metabolism and hormones

08:05.220 --> 08:09.260
 and other aspects that profoundly impact your wellbeing.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.220
 The problem with most blood tests, however,

08:11.220 --> 08:12.700
 is that you get information back

08:12.700 --> 08:13.660
 and it will tell you whether or not

08:13.660 --> 08:16.820
 your levels of something are high or low or within range,

08:16.820 --> 08:18.900
 but it doesn't give you any directives.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.440
 It doesn't tell you what to do with that information.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.500
 With InsideTracker, it has this wonderful feature.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.760
 It's a very easy to use dashboard

08:25.760 --> 08:28.140
 that has suggestions about lifestyle factors,

08:28.140 --> 08:30.660
 exercise, nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,

08:30.660 --> 08:33.740
 that one could take in order to adjust those numbers

08:33.740 --> 08:35.540
 according to your personal goals.

08:35.540 --> 08:36.980
 So the whole thing is made very easy.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.100
 In fact, they can come to your home

08:38.100 --> 08:40.780
 to do the blood test and DNA test if you like.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.520
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

08:42.520 --> 08:45.940

 you can get a free inner age test.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.300
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.100
 Helix makes mattresses and pillows

09:21.100 --> 09:24.100
 that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.160
 Everybody's different.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.560
 Some people sleep on their side.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.700
 Some people sleep on their stomach.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.140
 Some people sleep on their back.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.700
 Some people run warm during the night.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.180
 Some people run cold.

09:33.180 --> 09:35.820
 If you go to the Helix's website, helixsleep.com,

09:35.820 --> 09:38.020
 you can take a quick two minute quiz

09:38.020 --> 09:40.620
 and then it will tell you what your ideal mattress is.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.220
 It will match you to your ideal mattress.

09:43.220 --> 09:46.820
 I did this and I matched to the so-called dusk mattress.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.020
 I like a mattress that's not too firm nor too soft.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.740
 I tend to run hot during the night

09:51.740 --> 09:54.900
 and I tend to sleep on my side or on my stomach.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.880
 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress about nine months ago

09:57.880 --> 10:00.780
 and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before.

10:00.780 --> 10:02.500
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress

10:02.500 --> 10:04.920
 to one that's ideally suited to your sleep needs,

10:04.920 --> 10:07.780
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

10:07.780 --> 10:09.140
 take their two minute sleep quiz

10:09.140 --> 10:11.060
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress

10:11.060 --> 10:14.980
 and you'll get up to $200 off that mattress order

10:14.980 --> 10:16.820
 and two free pillows.

10:16.820 --> 10:17.980
 They have a 10 year warranty

10:17.980 --> 10:19.180
 and you get to try out the mattress

10:19.180 --> 10:20.660
 for a hundred nights risk-free.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.340
 They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,

10:22.340 --> 10:24.060
 but I think you really will love it.

10:24.060 --> 10:25.100
 So again, if you're interested,

10:25.100 --> 10:27.340
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

10:27.340 --> 10:30.320
 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.420
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.100
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

10:35.100 --> 10:37.460
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

10:37.460 --> 10:41.100
 I started drinking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.600
 And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.460
 The reason I started drinking Athletic Greens

10:45.460 --> 10:47.420
 and the reason why I still drink it once

10:47.420 --> 10:50.140
 or even twice a day is because it takes care

10:50.140 --> 10:53.300
 of all my foundational nutritional needs.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.780
 It includes vitamins, minerals, and probiotics

10:55.780 --> 10:59.500
 which are important for the gut microbiome,

10:59.500 --> 11:01.940
 this colony of bacteria, healthy bacteria

11:01.940 --> 11:03.720
 that we all have living in our guts.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.380
 And when that bacteria is healthy,

11:06.380 --> 11:07.580
 our brain functions better.

11:07.580 --> 11:08.960
 Our immune system functions better.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.860
 There is now a lot of research to support that.

11:11.860 --> 11:13.620
 Athletic Greens tastes delicious.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.440
 I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.900
 And as I mentioned, I drink it once or twice a day,

11:18.900 --> 11:21.620
 usually in the morning and again in the afternoon.

11:21.620 --> 11:23.440
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

11:23.440 --> 11:26.740
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

11:26.740 --> 11:28.080
 and claim a special offer.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.320
 That special offer is a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.340
 There's now a robust literature showing

11:35.340 --> 11:37.920
 that vitamin D3 is critical for various aspects

11:37.920 --> 11:41.180
 of our health, metabolic health, endocrine health, et cetera.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.780
 And you'll also get five free travel packs.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.540
 When you travel, mixing up Athletic Greens

11:45.540 --> 11:47.540
 is made really easy by these little travel packs.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.500
 You just put them in a jar or a water bottle,

11:50.500 --> 11:51.460
 mix it with water.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.080
 It's very easy to do on a plane or in the car, et cetera.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.820
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

11:56.820 --> 11:59.300
 to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs

11:59.300 --> 12:02.300
 and the year supply of vitamin D3, K2.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.480
 So let's talk about pleasure and pain.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.360
 I think we all intuitively understand

12:07.360 --> 12:09.520
 what pleasure and pain are.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.180
 Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body

12:12.180 --> 12:16.260
 and in the mind that leads us to pursue more

12:16.260 --> 12:19.460
 of whatever is bringing about that sensation.

12:19.460 --> 12:24.460
 And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind

12:24.460 --> 12:28.120
 that in general leads us to want to withdraw

12:28.120 --> 12:31.840
 or move away from some activity or interaction.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.080
 That's not always the case.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.440
 Some people actively seek out pain.

12:35.440 --> 12:39.380
 Some people somehow can't seem to engage with

12:39.380 --> 12:42.600
 or experience pleasure, but most people operate

12:42.600 --> 12:45.080
 on this basis of pleasure and pain.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.280
 Scientists would call this a pettative behaviors,

12:48.280 --> 12:51.680
 meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite

12:51.680 --> 12:53.840
 for more of those behaviors

12:53.840 --> 12:57.080
 and aversive behaviors, behaviors that make us want

12:57.080 --> 12:58.760
 to move away from something.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.520
 The simplest example of that would be putting your hand

13:01.520 --> 13:02.840
 near a hot flame.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.160
 At some point, there would be a reflex

13:05.160 --> 13:08.720
 or a deep desire to withdraw your hand.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.260
 Tasting something delicious in general makes us want

13:11.260 --> 13:13.080
 to eat more of that thing.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.000
 Interactions with other people that we find delicious

13:16.000 --> 13:18.720
 also make us want to interact with those people more.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.280
 None of this is complicated or sophisticated.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.760
 This is simply to illustrate the fact that pleasure

13:24.760 --> 13:27.680
 and pain tend to evoke opposite responses,

13:27.680 --> 13:29.320
 opposite behavioral responses

13:29.320 --> 13:31.440
 and opposite emotional responses.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.160
 So how does that come about?

13:33.160 --> 13:36.080
 Well, it really comes about by an interaction

13:36.080 --> 13:40.180
 that starts at one end of our body, meaning our skin,

13:40.180 --> 13:42.920
 and the other end of the organs of our body,

13:42.920 --> 13:44.640
 which is deep within the brain.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.480
 So let's consider these two ends of the spectrum

13:47.480 --> 13:50.400
 of pleasure and pain and what they contribute

13:50.400 --> 13:52.720
 to those experiences of pleasure and pain.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.600
 The organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier,

13:56.600 --> 13:58.880
 is the largest organ in our body.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.160
 And throughout that organ, we have neurons,

14:02.160 --> 14:03.260
 little nerve cells.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.000
 Now, to be really technical about it,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.020
 and the way I'd like you to understand it,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.220
 is that the so-called cell body,

14:09.220 --> 14:12.280
 meaning the location of a cell in which the DNA

14:12.280 --> 14:15.480
 and other goodies, the kind of central factory of the cell,

14:15.480 --> 14:18.320
 that actually sits right outside your spinal cord.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.120
 So all up and down your spinal cord on either side

14:22.120 --> 14:24.440
 are these little blobs of neurons,

14:24.440 --> 14:25.920
 little collections of neurons.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.320
 They have a name, if you'd like to know,

14:27.320 --> 14:29.320
 for you aficionados or those who are curious,

14:29.320 --> 14:33.200
 they're called DRGs, dorsal root ganglia.

14:33.200 --> 14:37.160
 A ganglion is just a collection or a clump of cells.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.620
 And those DRGs are really interesting

14:39.620 --> 14:43.400
 because they send one branch that we call an axon,

14:43.400 --> 14:46.060
 a little wire, out to our skin,

14:46.060 --> 14:48.040
 also to our muscles and to our organs.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.500
 But here we're talking about the skin.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.160
 They send a wire out to our skin

14:51.160 --> 14:55.260
 and that wire literally reaches up into the skin.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.160
 It's actually in our skin.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.320
 And they have another wire from that same cell body

15:00.320 --> 15:01.560
 that goes in the opposite direction,

15:01.560 --> 15:03.520
 which is up to our brain

15:03.520 --> 15:06.760
 and creates connections within our brain

15:06.760 --> 15:08.480
 in the so-called brainstem.

15:08.480 --> 15:13.480
 What this means is that the neuron in your body

15:13.480 --> 15:17.960
 that we call the DRG that sends a wire, an axon,

15:17.960 --> 15:20.560
 to sense what's going on in your big toe

15:21.480 --> 15:24.200
 and then sends another axon in the opposite direction

15:24.200 --> 15:25.680
 into the base of your brain.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.860
 That is the largest cell in your entire body of any kind,

15:29.860 --> 15:33.040
 fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.720
 Those are extremely long cells.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.220
 They can be a meter or more

15:36.220 --> 15:38.160
 depending on how tall you happen to be.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.000
 So we have these cells that have wires

15:40.000 --> 15:41.360
 that go off in two different directions

15:41.360 --> 15:44.040
 and the wire that's within our skin

15:44.040 --> 15:48.400
 will respond to any number of different categories

15:48.400 --> 15:50.000
 of stimuli, okay?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.980
 These wires are positioned within the skin

15:52.980 --> 15:57.080
 to respond to mechanical forces, so maybe light touch.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.520
 Some will only send electrical activity

16:00.520 --> 16:04.440
 up toward the brain in response to light touch,

16:04.440 --> 16:06.600
 meaning if you press on the skin really hard,

16:06.600 --> 16:07.760
 they don't respond.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.800
 You stroke the skin lightly with your fingertip or a feather

16:10.800 --> 16:13.600
 and they respond very robustly.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.080
 Others respond to course pressure, to hard pressure,

16:17.080 --> 16:20.240
 but they won't respond to a light feather.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.360
 For instance, others respond to temperature.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.280
 So they will respond to the presence of heat

16:26.280 --> 16:30.040
 or the presence of cold or changes in heat and cold.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.140
 And still others respond to other types of stimuli

16:33.140 --> 16:35.820
 like certain chemicals on our skin.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.320
 Many of you have probably experienced the sensation

16:38.320 --> 16:40.140
 of eating a hot pepper.

16:40.140 --> 16:41.600
 Well, I don't recommend doing this,

16:41.600 --> 16:44.160
 but were you to take a little slice of jalapeno

16:44.160 --> 16:47.040
 or other hot pepper, habanero pepper or something like that

16:47.040 --> 16:48.480
 and rub it on your skin,

16:48.480 --> 16:52.140
 you would actually feel something at that location.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.100
 And that's because that pepper doesn't just create

16:55.100 --> 16:56.600
 a sensation within your mouth,

16:56.600 --> 17:00.000
 it will create a similar sensation on your skin.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.320
 So these neurons are amazing.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.320
 They're collecting information of particular kinds

17:04.320 --> 17:06.840
 from the skin throughout the entire body

17:06.840 --> 17:10.100
 and sending that information up toward the brain.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.960
 And what's really incredible,

17:11.960 --> 17:14.040
 I just want you to ponder this for a second.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.920
 What's really incredible is that the language

17:15.920 --> 17:18.820
 that those neurons use is exactly the same.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.300
 The neuron that responds to light touch

17:21.300 --> 17:23.760
 sends electrical signals up toward the brain.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.220
 The neurons that respond to cold or to heat

17:27.220 --> 17:29.520
 or to habanero pepper,

17:29.520 --> 17:33.080
 they only respond to the particular thing

17:33.080 --> 17:36.840
 that evokes the electrical response.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.900
 I should say that they only respond

17:38.900 --> 17:40.780
 to the particular stimulus,

17:40.780 --> 17:42.800
 the pepper, the cold, the heat, et cetera,

17:42.800 --> 17:45.440
 that will evoke an electrical signal.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.040
 But the electrical signals are a common language

17:48.040 --> 17:49.340
 that all neurons use.

17:49.340 --> 17:53.080
 And yet if something cold is presented to your skin

17:53.080 --> 17:54.440
 like an ice cube,

17:54.440 --> 17:56.360
 even if you don't see that ice cube,

17:56.360 --> 17:58.720
 if your eyes are closed or someone comes up behind you

17:58.720 --> 18:02.480
 and puts an ice cube against your bare skinned back,

18:02.480 --> 18:05.920
 you know that that sensation, that thing is cold.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.000
 You don't misperceive it as heat

18:08.000 --> 18:10.400
 or as a habanero pepper, okay?

18:10.400 --> 18:11.340
 So that's amazing.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.640
 What that means is that there must be another element

18:14.640 --> 18:17.920
 in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.680
 And that element is your brain.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.440
 Your brain takes these electrical signals

18:22.440 --> 18:25.740
 and interprets them partially based on experience,

18:25.740 --> 18:27.620
 but also there are some innate,

18:27.620 --> 18:31.560
 meaning some hardwired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing

18:31.560 --> 18:33.880
 that require no experience whatsoever.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.360
 A child doesn't have to fall down,

18:36.360 --> 18:40.160
 but wants to know on that first fall that hurt.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.160
 They don't have to touch a flame, but once,

18:42.160 --> 18:44.340
 and the very first time they will withdraw their hand

18:44.340 --> 18:45.880
 from the flame.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.520
 So no prior experience is required.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.160
 Other things, prior experience is required.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.060
 For instance, if you're somebody that has

18:53.060 --> 18:56.900
 a intense aversion to spicy foods,

18:56.900 --> 19:00.400
 that's probably because you've tasted spicy foods before.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.040
 Likewise, if you really like sweet foods,

19:03.040 --> 19:05.420
 it's probably because you've tasted them before.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.720
 So you can start to make predictions

19:06.720 --> 19:07.920
 based on prior experience,

19:07.920 --> 19:09.240
 but the pain and pleasure system

19:09.240 --> 19:11.560
 don't need prior experience.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.640
 What they need is a brain that can interpret

19:13.640 --> 19:14.660
 these electrical signals.

19:14.660 --> 19:16.080
 They can take these electrical signals

19:16.080 --> 19:19.080
 and somehow create what we call pleasure

19:19.080 --> 19:21.100
 and pain out of them.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.720
 So what parts of the brain?

19:22.720 --> 19:26.280
 Well, mainly it's the so-called somatosensory cortex,

19:26.280 --> 19:28.680
 the portion of our neocortex,

19:28.680 --> 19:30.040
 which is on the outside of our brain,

19:30.040 --> 19:31.960
 the kind of bumpy part, not kind of,

19:31.960 --> 19:34.880
 if you have a normally formed brain, it will be bumpy.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.960
 If you have a smooth brain, that's not good.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.700
 Some animals just have a smooth brain.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.000
 Humans have a bumpy brain,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.600
 which means it has a very large surface area.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.160
 And those bumps are because you squeezed it like a pizza

19:44.160 --> 19:47.220
 and bunched it all up and put inside the skull.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.060
 So that's good.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.960
 That means you have a lot of neurons.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.260
 And in your somatosensory cortex,

19:52.260 --> 19:54.640
 you have a map of your entire body surface.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.600
 That map is called a homunculus.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.500
 And if we were to take your cortex and lay it out on a table,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.360
 I've actually done this with the cortices

20:03.360 --> 20:07.040
 of various animals and humans included.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.040
 What you would find is that there's literally a map

20:10.040 --> 20:12.500
 of your entire body surface,

20:12.500 --> 20:14.960
 but it wouldn't look exactly like you.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.080
 This map would be very distorted.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.320
 Why would it be distorted?

20:19.320 --> 20:21.640
 Well, certain areas of your body

20:21.640 --> 20:24.920
 have a much denser innervation as we call it,

20:24.920 --> 20:28.880
 or put simply many more of these sensory wires

20:28.880 --> 20:31.260
 from these DRGs within your skin.

20:31.260 --> 20:33.640
 So this map of you that exists in your brain,

20:33.640 --> 20:36.280
 and you do have one of these on each side of your brain,

20:36.280 --> 20:40.480
 so you have two of these maps, two homunculi, that is you.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.360
 It's your representation of touch,

20:42.360 --> 20:44.180
 including pleasure and pain.

20:44.180 --> 20:48.700
 And in that map, your lips are enormous

20:48.700 --> 20:51.720
 and your back is very, very small.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.400
 And the area around your eyes

20:53.400 --> 20:57.420
 and the area representing your face is absolutely enormous.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.400
 So you would look like some sort of odd, weird clay doll

21:00.400 --> 21:03.400
 from some sort of bizarre late night animation thing,

21:03.400 --> 21:05.840
 and just imagine the psychedelic experience

21:05.840 --> 21:08.640
 of that character of you,

21:08.640 --> 21:10.460
 and that's what it would look like.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.520
 But it's not randomly organized.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.200
 To the contrary, it's highly organized

21:15.200 --> 21:17.060
 in a very particular way,

21:17.060 --> 21:19.540
 which is that the areas of your skin

21:19.540 --> 21:23.960
 that have the highest density of these sensory receptors

21:23.960 --> 21:26.640
 are magnified in your brain.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.680
 So it's sort of like having more pixels

21:29.680 --> 21:32.820
 in a certain part of a camera than others,

21:32.820 --> 21:35.920
 and in doing that, allowing higher resolution,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.480
 in this case of touch, not a vision,

21:38.480 --> 21:42.360
 but of touch sensation in certain parts of your body.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.360
 What are the areas that are magnified?

21:44.360 --> 21:48.580
 Well, the lips, the face, the tips of the fingers,

21:48.580 --> 21:51.080
 the feet, and the genitals.

21:51.080 --> 21:55.420
 And so this map of you has very large lips, face,

21:55.420 --> 21:58.280
 tips of fingers, bottoms of feet, and genitals.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.840
 And that's because the innervation,

22:00.840 --> 22:05.160
 the number of wires that go into those regions of your body

22:05.160 --> 22:09.280
 far exceeds the number of wires for sensation of touch

22:09.280 --> 22:12.400
 that go to other areas of your body.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.480
 You can actually experience this in real time right now

22:16.480 --> 22:17.820
 by doing a simple experiment

22:17.820 --> 22:20.420
 that we call two-point discrimination.

22:20.420 --> 22:23.000
 Two-point discrimination is your ability

22:23.000 --> 22:26.380
 to know whether or not two points of pressure

22:26.380 --> 22:29.880
 are far apart, near each other,

22:29.880 --> 22:33.240
 or you actually could perceive incorrectly

22:33.240 --> 22:35.320
 as one point of pressure.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.720
 You might want a second person to do this experiment.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.600
 Here's how you would do it.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.920
 You would close your eyes.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.420
 That person would take two fine points.

22:43.420 --> 22:44.780
 Don't make them too sharp, please.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.760
 So it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.160
 Two pens, I'm holding in my hands.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.200
 If you're just listening to this, I'm just holding two pens.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.120
 My favorite pens, these Pilot V5s or V7s, which I love.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.160
 If you were to close your eyes

22:58.160 --> 23:00.560
 and I were to take these two pens

23:00.560 --> 23:03.720
 and put their points close together about a centimeter apart

23:03.720 --> 23:05.640
 and present them to the top of your hand,

23:05.640 --> 23:07.360
 I'm just going to do that now to myself,

23:07.360 --> 23:09.160
 you, even though your eyes were closed,

23:09.160 --> 23:10.220
 you would be able to perceive

23:10.220 --> 23:12.320
 that that was two points of pressure

23:12.320 --> 23:15.240
 presented simultaneously to the top of your hand.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.880
 However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back,

23:18.880 --> 23:21.660
 you would not experience them as two points of pressure.

23:21.660 --> 23:25.060
 You would experience them as one single point of pressure.

23:25.060 --> 23:27.880
 In other words, your two-point discrimination is better,

23:27.880 --> 23:30.880
 is higher on areas of your body

23:30.880 --> 23:33.720
 which have many, many more sensory receptors.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.580
 You are more sensitive at those locations.

23:36.580 --> 23:37.960
 Now, this makes perfect sense

23:37.960 --> 23:40.420
 once you experience it or you hear about it.

23:40.420 --> 23:44.040
 However, most of us don't really appreciate how important

23:44.040 --> 23:45.600
 and what a profound influence

23:45.600 --> 23:47.840
 this change in density of receptors

23:47.840 --> 23:50.040
 across our body surface has.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.440
 And we can go a step further

23:51.440 --> 23:53.760
 and describe another feature of the way that you're built

23:53.760 --> 23:56.020
 and the way that you experience pleasure and pain,

23:56.020 --> 23:58.120
 which is called the dermatome.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.840
 The dermatome is literally the way

24:00.840 --> 24:04.200
 in which your body surface is carved up

24:04.200 --> 24:06.140
 into different territories,

24:06.140 --> 24:08.280
 much like a map of the United States

24:08.280 --> 24:10.520
 is carved up into different territories of states

24:10.520 --> 24:12.200
 and counties, et cetera.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.440
 The dermatome is the way in which neurons connect

24:16.440 --> 24:18.480
 to different parts of your body.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.480
 Now, you've actually experienced the dermatome before.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.120
 The dermatome is when you have a neuron

24:24.120 --> 24:26.520
 that connects to a particular area of the body

24:26.520 --> 24:29.680
 and that neuron doesn't just send one little wire out

24:29.680 --> 24:31.920
 like one little line and go up into the skin

24:31.920 --> 24:34.900
 to detect mechanical or thermal or chemical stimuli.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.760
 It actually sends many branches out like a tree.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.840
 But remember, those branches of the tree

24:39.840 --> 24:42.420
 come from one single neuron.

24:42.420 --> 24:44.280
 Now, occasionally what will happen

24:44.280 --> 24:48.320
 is you will experience something like cold or heat

24:48.320 --> 24:52.640
 or pain or tingling on a patch of your body.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.640
 And occasionally that patch of body

24:54.640 --> 24:58.420
 will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary,

24:58.420 --> 25:02.040
 a very stark boundary with the areas around it.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.540
 A good example of this would be the herpes simplex 1 virus,

25:05.540 --> 25:07.680
 which if one has this virus,

25:07.680 --> 25:10.680
 and I should mention that somewhere between 80 and 90%

25:10.680 --> 25:12.120
 of people have this virus.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.100
 This is not a sexually transmitted virus.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
 This is a virus that's transmitted very easily

25:16.100 --> 25:19.240
 between people through various forms of contact,

25:19.240 --> 25:20.660
 non-sexual contact.

25:20.660 --> 25:22.840
 It's present in children and it's present in adults.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.600
 And most people get it.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.200
 Some get symptoms and some don't.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.080
 Some get recurring symptoms, some don't.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.680
 We can talk about that at the end if you like.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.440
 But this virus lives on what's called

25:33.440 --> 25:36.160
 the fifth cranial nerve, also called the trigeminal nerve.

25:36.160 --> 25:40.560
 The trigeminal nerve sends branches out to the lips,

25:40.560 --> 25:43.040
 to the eyes and to certain portions of the face.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.080
 So for those of you listening,

25:44.080 --> 25:46.800
 I've just kind of put my right hand across my face

25:46.800 --> 25:49.240
 and to sort of simulate the three branches,

25:49.240 --> 25:52.500
 the trigeminal aspect of this nerve.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.160
 So try three.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.320
 Now, when the herpes virus flares up,

25:57.320 --> 26:00.900
 as they say in response to stress or other factors,

26:00.900 --> 26:03.560
 the virus inflames that nerve

26:03.560 --> 26:07.920
 and people experience tingling and pain on the nerve.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.200
 Sometimes they'll get a cold sore or a blister

26:10.200 --> 26:11.840
 on their lip or near their mouth.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.560
 Sometimes they'll get a collection of those.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.840
 And that's because that dermatome is actually inflamed.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.060
 Now, other people will experience

26:20.060 --> 26:21.720
 something like shingles, right?

26:21.720 --> 26:25.660
 It's a fairly common viral infection.

26:25.660 --> 26:27.840
 And what they'll notice is they'll get a rash

26:27.840 --> 26:28.860
 that has a boundary.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.280
 It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps,

26:30.280 --> 26:33.200
 sometimes blisters, and it'll have a sharp boundary.

26:33.200 --> 26:38.000
 That boundary exists because the virus exists on the nerve.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.040
 And so it actually is boundaried

26:41.040 --> 26:43.400
 with the neighboring area of the body

26:43.400 --> 26:46.720
 that's receiving input from another nerve.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.160
 And that one doesn't have the virus living on it.

26:49.160 --> 26:53.160
 So anytime you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface,

26:53.160 --> 26:55.680
 on the skin, that has a pretty stark boundary,

26:55.680 --> 27:00.320
 chances are that's an event that's impacting the dermatome.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.720
 I've experienced this before,

27:01.720 --> 27:03.080
 not through herpes simplex,

27:03.080 --> 27:07.600
 but through the experience of having a lot of blood

27:07.600 --> 27:09.860
 sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment

27:09.860 --> 27:11.040
 across the front of my face.

27:11.040 --> 27:11.880
 It was really bizarre.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.700
 I looked in the mirror and I thought,

27:12.700 --> 27:13.540
 what is going on here?

27:13.540 --> 27:16.400
 I was having an allergic reaction to something I'd eaten.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.480
 And that allergic reaction clearly was affecting

27:19.480 --> 27:21.800
 one of the nerves and therefore the dermatome.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.160
 And what it showed up was,

27:23.160 --> 27:25.900
 it was almost like someone had drawn lines on my face

27:25.900 --> 27:29.100
 that said, okay, this rash or this reaction rather

27:29.100 --> 27:32.460
 can happen here, but not in the region right next to it.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.560
 Whenever you see that,

27:33.560 --> 27:37.780
 chances are it's a reaction of the nerves of the dermatome.

27:37.780 --> 27:40.060
 So you'll start to see these things more and more

27:40.060 --> 27:41.700
 when you start to look for them.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.340
 You don't always have to have a viral infection

27:43.340 --> 27:44.180
 to experience this.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.120
 Sometimes you'll just experience tingling

27:46.120 --> 27:47.980
 or even a pleasant sensation,

27:47.980 --> 27:51.280
 and it will be restricted in kind of a strict boundary

27:51.280 --> 27:54.460
 on one location of your body surface and not another.

27:54.460 --> 27:58.580
 Not corresponding to an organ like, okay, this arm,

27:58.580 --> 28:01.600
 or just your feet or something like that,

28:01.600 --> 28:02.700
 but just a segment.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.020
 It's almost like someone outlined a particular area

28:05.020 --> 28:06.180
 of your body surface.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.500
 That's the dermatome.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.520
 Okay, so you've got sensors in the skin

28:10.520 --> 28:12.660
 and you've got a brain that's going to interpret

28:12.660 --> 28:14.980
 what's going on with those sensors.

28:14.980 --> 28:18.120
 In fact, we can take an example of a sudden rash

28:18.120 --> 28:20.740
 or inflammation at one location in the dermatome,

28:20.740 --> 28:24.100
 and we can ask what would make it hurt?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.920
 What would make it worse?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.940
 What would make it go away?

28:27.940 --> 28:31.180
 And believe it or not, your subjective interpretation

28:31.180 --> 28:34.680
 of what's happening has a profound influence

28:34.680 --> 28:38.020
 on your experience of pleasure or pain.

28:38.020 --> 28:41.140
 There are several things that can impact these experiences,

28:41.140 --> 28:44.820
 but the main categories are expectation.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.860
 So sort of whether or not you thought or could expect

28:47.860 --> 28:50.600
 that this thing was going to happen, right?

28:50.600 --> 28:52.500
 If someone tells you this is going to hurt,

28:52.500 --> 28:54.220
 I'm going to give you an injection right here.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.540
 It might hurt for a second.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.500
 That's very different and your experience of that pain

28:57.500 --> 28:59.440
 will be very different than if it happened suddenly

28:59.440 --> 29:00.900
 out of the blue.

29:00.900 --> 29:04.160
 There's also anxiety, how anxious or how high or low

29:04.160 --> 29:07.240
 your level of arousal, autonomic arousal,

29:07.240 --> 29:11.560
 that's going to impact your experience of pleasure or pain.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.820
 How well you slept and where you are

29:14.820 --> 29:17.520
 in the so-called circadian or 24-hour cycle.

29:18.420 --> 29:22.360
 Our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically

29:22.360 --> 29:24.140
 across the 24-hour cycle.

29:24.140 --> 29:26.860
 And as you can imagine, it's during the daylight waking

29:26.860 --> 29:29.740
 hours that we are better able to tolerate.

29:29.740 --> 29:32.000
 We are more resilient to pain

29:32.000 --> 29:35.940
 and we are better able to experience pleasure.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.940
 At night, our threshold for pain is much lower.

29:39.940 --> 29:43.960
 In other words, the amount of mechanical or chemical

29:43.960 --> 29:45.940
 or thermal, meaning temperature stimulated

29:45.940 --> 29:47.380
 that can evoke a pain response

29:47.380 --> 29:52.380
 and how we would rate that response is much lower at night.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.340
 And in particular, in the hours between 2 AM and 5 AM

29:57.340 --> 30:00.100
 if you're on a kind of standard circadian schedule.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.820
 And then the last one is our genes.

30:02.820 --> 30:07.180
 Pain threshold and how long a pain response lasts

30:07.180 --> 30:09.460
 is in part dictated by our genes.

30:09.460 --> 30:12.500
 And later I'm going to discuss this myth

30:12.500 --> 30:15.180
 or whether or not it's really a myth

30:15.180 --> 30:18.300
 as to whether or not certain people in particular redheads,

30:18.300 --> 30:22.900
 people who have red pigmented hair and fair skin,

30:22.900 --> 30:24.940
 whether or not their pain thresholds differ.

30:24.940 --> 30:27.460
 And to just give you a little sneak peek into that,

30:27.460 --> 30:28.300
 indeed they do.

30:28.300 --> 30:30.580
 And it's because of a genetic difference

30:30.580 --> 30:34.120
 in a particular gene and a particular pattern of receptors

30:34.120 --> 30:36.300
 in the skin that are related

30:36.300 --> 30:40.100
 to the pigmentation of hair and skin.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.400
 So we have expectation, anxiety, how well we've slept,

30:43.400 --> 30:47.260
 where we are in the so-called 24 hour circadian time

30:47.260 --> 30:48.840
 and our genes.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.620
 So let's talk about expectation and anxiety

30:52.620 --> 30:55.860
 because those two factors can powerfully modulate

30:55.860 --> 30:58.180
 our experience of both pleasure and pain

30:58.180 --> 31:03.180
 in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure if we like

31:03.500 --> 31:07.300
 and to dial down pain if indeed that's what we want to do.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.800
 So let's talk about expectation and anxiety

31:09.800 --> 31:12.980
 because those two things are somewhat tethered.

31:12.980 --> 31:15.420
 There are now a number of solid experiments,

31:15.420 --> 31:18.500
 both in animal models and in humans

31:18.500 --> 31:21.260
 that point to the fact that if we know

31:21.260 --> 31:23.500
 a painful stimulus is coming,

31:23.500 --> 31:26.460
 that we can better prepare for it mentally

31:26.460 --> 31:30.460
 and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response.

31:30.460 --> 31:35.140
 However, the timing in which that anticipation occurs

31:35.140 --> 31:37.580
 is vital for this to happen.

31:37.580 --> 31:40.020
 And if that timing isn't quite right,

31:40.020 --> 31:43.620
 it actually can make the experience of pain far worse.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.780
 So here I'm summarizing a large amount of literature,

31:46.780 --> 31:49.500
 but essentially if subjects are warned

31:49.500 --> 31:51.820
 that a painful stimulus is coming,

31:51.820 --> 31:56.820
 their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced.

31:57.700 --> 32:01.220
 However, if they are warned just two seconds

32:01.220 --> 32:04.480
 before that pain arrives, it does not help.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.100
 It actually makes it worse.

32:06.100 --> 32:08.280
 And the reason is they can't do anything mentally

32:08.280 --> 32:11.240
 to prepare for it in that brief two second window.

32:12.220 --> 32:15.860
 Similarly, if they are warned about pain that's coming

32:15.860 --> 32:18.620
 two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming,

32:18.620 --> 32:21.500
 electric shock or a poke or cold stimulus

32:21.500 --> 32:23.740
 or heat stimulus that's pretty extreme,

32:24.580 --> 32:28.660
 that also makes it worse because their expectation ramps up

32:28.660 --> 32:31.820
 the autonomic arousal, the level of alertness

32:31.820 --> 32:35.180
 is all funneled toward that negative experience

32:35.180 --> 32:36.660
 that's coming.

32:36.660 --> 32:40.640
 So how soon before a painful stimulus

32:40.640 --> 32:42.940
 should we know about it if the goal

32:42.940 --> 32:45.900
 is to reduce our level of pain?

32:45.900 --> 32:49.660
 And the answer is somewhere between 20 seconds

32:49.660 --> 32:52.040
 and 40 seconds is about right.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.660
 Now I'm averaging across a number of different studies,

32:54.660 --> 32:58.700
 but if you have about 20 seconds or 40 seconds

32:58.700 --> 33:01.100
 advance warning that something bad is coming,

33:01.100 --> 33:03.220
 you can prepare yourself for that.

33:03.220 --> 33:05.580
 But the preparation itself and the arousal

33:05.580 --> 33:07.040
 that comes with it, the kind of leaning in,

33:07.040 --> 33:09.440
 okay, I'm either going to relax myself

33:09.440 --> 33:11.780
 or I'm going to really kind of dig my heels in

33:11.780 --> 33:13.720
 and kind of meet the pain head on,

33:14.560 --> 33:16.620
 that seems to be the optimal window.

33:16.620 --> 33:19.360
 This can come in useful in a variety of contexts,

33:19.360 --> 33:23.300
 but I think it's important because what it illustrates

33:23.300 --> 33:27.420
 is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern of signals

33:27.420 --> 33:31.540
 that are arriving from the skin from these DRGs,

33:31.540 --> 33:33.520
 these neurons that connect to skin

33:33.520 --> 33:36.840
 that dictates our experience of pain or pleasure.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.460
 There has to be a subjective interpretation component

33:40.460 --> 33:41.980
 and indeed that's the case.

33:41.980 --> 33:46.300
 So let's talk about the range of pain experiences

33:46.300 --> 33:48.120
 and from that, we will understand better

33:48.120 --> 33:50.620
 what the range of pleasure experiences are

33:50.620 --> 33:52.020
 that different people have,

33:52.020 --> 33:55.060
 because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.180
 First of all, what is pain threshold?

33:57.180 --> 33:59.360
 Pain threshold has two dimensions.

33:59.360 --> 34:04.360
 The first dimension is the amount of mechanical or chemical

34:04.380 --> 34:07.800
 or thermal stimulation that it takes for you or me

34:07.800 --> 34:11.580
 or somebody else to say, I can't take that anymore, I'm done.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.160
 But there's another element as well,

34:13.160 --> 34:16.100
 which is how long the pain persists.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.340
 I'll just describe myself, for example,

34:18.340 --> 34:20.100
 I don't consider myself somebody

34:20.100 --> 34:22.500
 who has a particularly high pain threshold.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.200
 I don't think it's particularly low either,

34:24.200 --> 34:25.620
 but I wouldn't consider myself somebody

34:25.620 --> 34:28.260
 that has a particularly high pain threshold.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.940
 When I stub my toe against the corner of the bed,

34:30.940 --> 34:32.820
 it absolutely hurts.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.000
 But one thing that I've noticed

34:34.000 --> 34:36.020
 is that I have very sharp inflections,

34:36.020 --> 34:39.620
 very high inflections in my perception of pain

34:39.620 --> 34:41.420
 and then they go away quickly.

34:41.420 --> 34:44.140
 I don't know if that's adaptive or not, it's probably not,

34:44.140 --> 34:48.380
 but my experience of pain is very intense, but very brief.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.260
 Other people experience pain

34:50.260 --> 34:54.660
 in a much kind of slower rising, but longer lasting manner.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.700
 And to just really point out how varied we all are

34:57.700 --> 34:59.660
 in terms of our experience of pain,

34:59.660 --> 35:01.860
 let's look to an experiment.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.280
 There have been experiments done

35:03.280 --> 35:06.180
 at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere,

35:06.180 --> 35:08.460
 which involved having subjects put their hand

35:08.460 --> 35:10.860
 into a very cold vat of water

35:10.860 --> 35:12.420
 and measuring the amount of time

35:12.420 --> 35:14.300
 that they kept their hand in that water.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.940
 And then they would tell the experimenter very quietly

35:17.940 --> 35:20.940
 how painful that particular stimulus was

35:20.940 --> 35:22.280
 on a scale of one to 10,

35:22.280 --> 35:24.800
 so-called Likert scale for you aficionados.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.340
 That simple experiment revealed

35:28.340 --> 35:32.420
 that people experience the same thermal,

35:32.420 --> 35:36.420
 in this case, cold stimulus, vastly different.

35:36.420 --> 35:40.260
 Some people would rate it as a 10 out of 10, extreme pain.

35:40.260 --> 35:42.980
 Other people would rate it as barely painful at all,

35:42.980 --> 35:43.860
 like a one.

35:43.860 --> 35:44.980
 Other people, a three.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.340
 Other people, a five, et cetera.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.280
 Now what's interesting is that the same thing is true

35:50.280 --> 35:53.540
 for experience of a hot painful stimulus,

35:53.540 --> 35:56.860
 120 degree hot plate where you have to put your hand on it.

35:56.860 --> 35:58.740
 And then at some point you remove your hand.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.140
 Some people are able to keep their hand

36:00.140 --> 36:01.700
 on there the whole time,

36:01.700 --> 36:05.480
 but people rate that experience as very painful,

36:05.480 --> 36:07.780
 a little bit painful or moderately painful

36:07.780 --> 36:10.380
 depending on who they are.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.740
 Now that's interesting,

36:11.740 --> 36:14.340
 probably not that surprising, however.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.100
 But what is very interesting is that

36:16.100 --> 36:19.680
 when the same experiment was done on medical doctors

36:19.680 --> 36:21.640
 or medical doctors in training,

36:21.640 --> 36:24.520
 they too, of course, experienced pain

36:24.520 --> 36:27.220
 through a range of subjective experiences.

36:27.220 --> 36:30.100
 Some of them, just like any other person off the street,

36:30.940 --> 36:33.760
 said a particular stimulus of a particular temperature

36:33.760 --> 36:34.760
 was very painful.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.020
 Others said it wasn't painful at all.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.420
 And some said it was moderately painful.

36:38.420 --> 36:40.580
 And that turns out to be vitally important

36:40.580 --> 36:43.100
 for the treatment of pain

36:43.100 --> 36:45.820
 because pain is not an event in the skin.

36:45.820 --> 36:49.200
 Pain is a subjective emotional experience.

36:49.200 --> 36:52.220
 You may have heard that we have a particular category

36:52.220 --> 36:54.420
 of these DRGs that innervate the skin,

36:54.420 --> 36:56.380
 which are called nociceptors.

36:56.380 --> 37:01.060
 Nociceptor comes from the word nocera, I believe it is,

37:01.060 --> 37:02.640
 which means to harm.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.120
 However, nociceptors don't carry information about pain.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.020
 They carry information about particular types of stimuli

37:09.020 --> 37:10.500
 impacting the skin.

37:10.500 --> 37:14.120
 And then the brain assigns a value, a valence to it,

37:14.120 --> 37:16.620
 a label, and says that's painful.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.060
 And where people draw the line

37:18.060 --> 37:20.420
 between not painful and painful varies.

37:20.420 --> 37:23.180
 Now, because physicians are people

37:23.180 --> 37:25.580
 and because physicians treat pain,

37:25.580 --> 37:28.700
 what we know from a lot of data now

37:28.700 --> 37:30.940
 is that if someone comes into the clinic

37:30.940 --> 37:32.940
 and says they're experiencing chronic pain

37:32.940 --> 37:35.560
 or whole body pain or acute pain after an injury

37:35.560 --> 37:36.760
 or one location,

37:36.760 --> 37:38.300
 it doesn't really matter what the cause is

37:38.300 --> 37:40.180
 or even if there's a cause at all.

37:41.580 --> 37:46.580
 How the doctor reacts to that report of the patient's pain

37:46.640 --> 37:49.460
 will dictate in many cases the course of treatment.

37:49.460 --> 37:52.580
 And of course, doctors, their goal is to treat the patient

37:52.580 --> 37:54.700
 according to the patient's needs, not their own.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.980
 And that's what good doctors do.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.100
 However, it's been found,

37:59.100 --> 38:01.060
 and I think now there is work being done

38:01.060 --> 38:03.300
 to try and change this.

38:03.300 --> 38:07.540
 But if a doctor has a very high threshold for pain,

38:07.540 --> 38:10.240
 their interpretation of somebody else's report of pain

38:10.240 --> 38:11.260
 is going to be different.

38:11.260 --> 38:13.640
 They might not discount the patient, right?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.080
 This doesn't necessarily mean that they think,

38:15.080 --> 38:17.720
 oh, this person, their pain is irrelevant.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.840
 Probably not.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.540
 In fact, from having a high threshold for pain,

38:21.540 --> 38:24.340
 if someone comes in and says, I'm in extreme pain,

38:24.340 --> 38:26.140
 that doctor probably thinks, wow,

38:26.140 --> 38:28.200
 this has to be really, really extreme.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.780
 But they can be talking about two different experiences.

38:31.780 --> 38:35.380
 Similarly, if a physician has a very low threshold for pain

38:35.380 --> 38:37.020
 and someone comes in and says,

38:38.620 --> 38:41.180
 yeah, I'm experiencing some pain in my back.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.380
 I've got the sciatica thing,

38:42.380 --> 38:44.820
 but it's a little bit uncomfortable.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.540
 It's like, I don't know, like a four out of 10.

38:47.540 --> 38:50.660
 Well, that physician might interpret that four out of 10

38:50.660 --> 38:54.060
 as a pretty extreme sense of pain

38:54.060 --> 38:56.180
 or a pretty extreme experience of pain.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.960
 And so you can start to see how the subjective nature

38:58.960 --> 39:01.720
 of pain can start to have real impact

39:01.720 --> 39:02.740
 on the treatment of pain

39:02.740 --> 39:05.720
 because treatment of pain is carried out by physicians.

39:05.720 --> 39:09.920
 In fact, there is no objective measure of pain.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.780
 We can ask how long somebody can keep their hand

39:11.780 --> 39:13.780
 on a hot plate or in a cold bath.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.620
 You can do various experiments.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.440
 They even have some extreme experiments

39:17.440 --> 39:20.140
 where they'll shave a portion of the leg

39:20.140 --> 39:23.780
 and they'll put on a very painful chemical compound

39:23.780 --> 39:25.460
 and see how long people can tolerate that.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.220
 These are very uncomfortable experiments,

39:27.220 --> 39:28.420
 as you can imagine.

39:28.420 --> 39:30.320
 But in general, we don't have a way

39:30.320 --> 39:34.040
 of measuring somebody else's subjective experience of pain.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.760
 There's no blood pressure measure.

39:35.760 --> 39:39.000
 There's no heart rate beats per minute measure of pain.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.720
 So one of the great efforts of neuroscience

39:41.720 --> 39:43.260
 and of medicine is to try and come up

39:43.260 --> 39:45.100
 with more objective measures of pain.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.220
 Similarly, pleasure is something that we all talk about.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.260
 Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that,

39:51.260 --> 39:54.020
 or more of that, please, or less of that.

39:54.020 --> 39:56.360
 But we have no way of gauging

39:56.360 --> 39:57.820
 what other people are experiencing

39:57.820 --> 40:00.900
 except what they report through language.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.980
 And so this is really just to illustrate

40:02.980 --> 40:05.660
 that this whole thing around pain isn't a black box.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.860
 We do have an understanding of the elements.

40:07.860 --> 40:08.700
 There are elements in the skin.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.840
 There's elements of the brain.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.540
 There's expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genes,

40:12.540 --> 40:15.400
 but that it is very complicated.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.260
 And yet there are certain principles

40:17.260 --> 40:19.720
 that fall out of that complicated picture

40:19.720 --> 40:21.720
 that can allow us to better understand

40:21.720 --> 40:25.520
 and navigate this axis that we call the pleasure pain axis.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.800
 So rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain,

40:28.800 --> 40:32.260
 let's talk about the absolute qualities of pain

40:32.260 --> 40:35.060
 and the absolute qualities of pleasure

40:35.060 --> 40:38.620
 so that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences

40:38.620 --> 40:41.000
 in ways that serve us each better.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.740
 First of all, I want to talk about heat and cold.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.480
 We do indeed have sensors in our skin

40:46.480 --> 40:48.500
 that respond to heat and cold.

40:48.500 --> 40:52.060
 And for any of you that have entered a cold shower

40:52.060 --> 40:56.900
 or a cold body of water of any kind or ice bath, et cetera,

40:56.900 --> 41:00.180
 you will realize that getting into cold

41:00.180 --> 41:03.180
 is much harder if you do it slowly.

41:03.180 --> 41:06.900
 Now, despite that, people tend to do it very slowly.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.340
 I have noticed an enormous variation

41:09.340 --> 41:13.420
 with which people can embrace the experience of cold.

41:13.420 --> 41:16.400
 I noticed it because I do some work with athletes

41:16.400 --> 41:17.620
 and I do some work with military

41:17.620 --> 41:19.460
 and I do some work with the general public.

41:19.460 --> 41:23.900
 And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain

41:23.900 --> 41:27.180
 is to ask them to just get into an ice bath.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.960
 It's not a very sophisticated experience,

41:28.960 --> 41:31.300
 but it really gets into the core of the kind of circuitry

41:31.300 --> 41:35.220
 that we're talking about, both in the skin and in the brain.

41:35.220 --> 41:39.820
 Some people, regardless of sex, regardless of age,

41:39.820 --> 41:42.860
 and regardless of physical ability

41:42.860 --> 41:44.740
 can just get into the cold.

41:45.620 --> 41:46.820
 They're somehow able to do it.

41:46.820 --> 41:48.820
 Now, I don't know what their experience of the cold is

41:48.820 --> 41:51.540
 and neither do you, you only know your experience,

41:51.540 --> 41:53.360
 but they're able to do that.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.960
 Some do it quickly, some do it slowly.

41:55.960 --> 41:59.540
 Others find the experience of cold to be so aversive

41:59.540 --> 42:01.780
 that they somehow cannot get themselves in.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.460
 They start quaking, they start complaining

42:04.460 --> 42:06.820
 and many of them just simply get out.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.840
 They can't do it, some don't even get in past their knees.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.060
 This isn't necessarily about pain threshold,

42:12.060 --> 42:13.500
 but it's related to that.

42:13.500 --> 42:17.040
 I think it can be helpful to everyone to know

42:17.040 --> 42:20.400
 that even though it feels better at a mental level

42:20.400 --> 42:23.240
 to get into the cold slowly and people ask,

42:23.240 --> 42:26.640
 oh, I just want to get in slowly, I want to take my time.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.920
 It is actually much worse

42:27.920 --> 42:30.280
 from a neurobiological perspective.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.840
 The neurons that sense cold respond

42:32.840 --> 42:36.260
 to what are called relative drops in temperature.

42:36.260 --> 42:39.780
 So it's not about the absolute temperature of the water,

42:39.780 --> 42:43.500
 it's about the relative change in temperature.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.240
 So as you move from a particular temperature,

42:46.240 --> 42:48.320
 whether or not it's in the air next to an ice bath

42:48.320 --> 42:51.320
 or cold shower, or from a body of water that's warm

42:51.320 --> 42:53.120
 to a body of water that's colder,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.140
 or sometimes in the ocean, you'll notice it's warm

42:55.140 --> 42:56.640
 and then as you swim out further,

42:56.640 --> 42:59.300
 you'll get into a pocket of water where it's much colder.

42:59.300 --> 43:02.320
 That's when the cold receptors in your skin start firing

43:02.320 --> 43:04.760
 and sending signals up to your brain.

43:04.760 --> 43:09.760
 Therefore, you can bypass these signals going up to the brain

43:09.760 --> 43:12.400
 with each relative change, one degree change,

43:12.400 --> 43:14.580
 two degrees change, et cetera,

43:14.580 --> 43:17.080
 by simply getting in all at once.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.200
 In fact, it is true.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.060
 And maybe you've been told this before and it is true

43:21.060 --> 43:23.880
 that if you get into cold water up to your neck,

43:23.880 --> 43:25.320
 it's actually much more comfortable

43:25.320 --> 43:27.360
 than if you're halfway in and halfway out.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.760
 And that's because of the difference in the signals

43:29.760 --> 43:31.920
 that are being sent from the cold receptors

43:31.920 --> 43:32.880
 on your upper torso,

43:32.880 --> 43:34.960
 which is out of the water in your lower torso.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.580
 Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this to mean

43:37.580 --> 43:39.800
 that they should just jump into an unknown body of water.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.900
 There are all sorts of factors like currents.

43:41.900 --> 43:44.280
 And if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed,

43:44.280 --> 43:45.240
 you can stop the heart.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.440
 People can have heart attacks

43:46.440 --> 43:48.520
 from getting into extremely cold water

43:48.520 --> 43:53.520
 like a melted mountain stream that's been frozen all winter

43:53.680 --> 43:57.440
 or has been very, very cold or has a snowpack going into it.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.600
 If it's very cold, you can indeed have a heart attack.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.040
 So please be smart about how cold

44:02.040 --> 44:03.920
 and what bodies of cold water

44:03.920 --> 44:05.600
 you happen to put yourself into.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.120
 But it is absolutely true that provided it's safe,

44:08.120 --> 44:11.180
 getting into a cold water is always going to be easier

44:11.180 --> 44:13.360
 to do quickly and is going to be easier

44:13.360 --> 44:15.040
 to do up to your neck.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.980
 In fact, you actually want to get your shoulders submerged.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.660
 There are a number of other things you can do

44:19.660 --> 44:21.360
 if you really want and it's safe to do.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.800
 You can put your face under

44:22.800 --> 44:24.780
 and activate the so-called dive reflex,

44:24.780 --> 44:27.960
 which also makes the tolerance of cold easier,

44:27.960 --> 44:28.960
 believe it or not.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.160
 So it's very counterintuitive.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.280
 It's like getting into cold water faster

44:32.280 --> 44:33.500
 and more completely,

44:33.500 --> 44:36.680
 you will experience as less uncomfortable, less cold.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.320
 And indeed that's the case.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.580
 And that's because these cold receptors

44:40.580 --> 44:43.840
 are measuring every relative drop in temperature.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.340
 So every single one is graded as we say in biology,

44:47.340 --> 44:48.760
 it's not absolute.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.220
 As an additional point,

44:51.220 --> 44:53.060
 if you're sitting in a body of cold water

44:53.060 --> 44:54.360
 and it's not circulating,

44:54.360 --> 44:57.040
 you'll notice that you start to warm up a little bit,

44:57.040 --> 44:59.460
 or even if you feel like you're freezing cold,

44:59.460 --> 45:02.840
 if you move and that water around you moves of course,

45:02.840 --> 45:04.880
 then you'll notice it's got even colder.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.480
 And that's because there's a thermal layer.

45:06.480 --> 45:08.240
 You're actually heating up the water

45:08.240 --> 45:09.240
 that surrounds your body,

45:09.240 --> 45:12.840
 like a halo around every aspect of your body,

45:12.840 --> 45:14.740
 a sort of silhouette of you of heat

45:14.740 --> 45:16.060
 where you're heating that water.

45:16.060 --> 45:19.780
 When you move, you disrupt that thermal layer.

45:19.780 --> 45:22.080
 Now heat is the opposite.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.260
 Heat and the heat receptors in your skin

45:24.260 --> 45:26.800
 respond to absolute changes in temperature.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.940
 And this is probably because our body and our brain

45:29.940 --> 45:32.040
 can tolerate drops in temperature

45:32.040 --> 45:34.080
 much better than it can tolerate

45:34.080 --> 45:36.540
 increases in temperature safely.

45:36.540 --> 45:40.200
 So when you move from say a standard outdoor environment,

45:40.200 --> 45:41.080
 I mean, here in the States,

45:41.080 --> 45:42.680
 we measure in terms of Fahrenheit.

45:42.680 --> 45:46.280
 So maybe it's a 75 or an 80 degree or even 90 degree day,

45:46.280 --> 45:48.720
 and you get into a hundred degree sauna,

45:48.720 --> 45:50.660
 or if you're in a cool air conditioned building

45:50.660 --> 45:53.300
 and you go outside and it's very warm outside,

45:53.300 --> 45:55.860
 you sort of feel like the heat hits you all at once.

45:55.860 --> 45:59.700
 Boom, hits you all at once, kind of like a slap in the face.

45:59.700 --> 46:01.600
 But then it will just stay at that level.

46:01.600 --> 46:05.440
 Your body will acclimate to that particular temperature.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.340
 However, if that temperature is very, very high,

46:08.340 --> 46:11.080
 you'll notice that your experience of that heat

46:11.080 --> 46:13.600
 and your experience of kind of pain and discomfort

46:13.600 --> 46:17.220
 and your desire to get out of that heat will tend to persist.

46:17.220 --> 46:19.600
 You don't really adapt in the same way.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.200
 And certain people who are really good

46:21.200 --> 46:23.580
 at handling very hot sauna get better at this.

46:23.580 --> 46:26.080
 You learn to calm your breathing, et cetera,

46:26.080 --> 46:28.160
 lower your autonomic arousal.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.200
 Obviously you don't want to let

46:29.200 --> 46:30.520
 your body temperature go too high

46:30.520 --> 46:32.640
 because if neurons cook, they die.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.800
 If neurons die, they don't come back.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.640
 And that's bad.

46:35.640 --> 46:39.320
 Many people unfortunately harm themselves with hyperthermia.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.840
 Everyone has a different threshold for this,

46:40.840 --> 46:43.680
 but in general, you don't want your body temperature

46:43.680 --> 46:44.600
 to go up too high.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.400
 That's why a fever of like 103

46:46.400 --> 46:48.400
 starts to become worrisome, 104.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
 You really get concerned if,

46:49.400 --> 46:52.440
 and it goes up into that range or higher,

46:52.440 --> 46:54.560
 that's when you need to really cool down the body

46:54.560 --> 46:57.000
 or get to the hospital so they can cool you down.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
 Heat is measured in absolute terms by the neurons.

47:02.380 --> 47:05.620
 So gradually moving into heat makes sense

47:05.620 --> 47:06.860
 and finding that threshold,

47:06.860 --> 47:09.000
 which is safe and comfortable for you,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.140
 or if it's uncomfortable,

47:10.140 --> 47:13.680
 at least resides within that realm of safety.

47:13.680 --> 47:14.980
 So that's heat and cold.

47:14.980 --> 47:17.220
 And those are sort of non-negotiables.

47:17.220 --> 47:19.620
 You can try and lower your level of arousal.

47:19.620 --> 47:22.020
 In fact, many people who will get into a cold shower

47:22.020 --> 47:24.900
 and ice bath, I think the recommendation that I always give

47:24.900 --> 47:27.900
 is that you have two possible approaches to that.

47:27.900 --> 47:29.580
 You can either try and relax yourself,

47:29.580 --> 47:32.580
 kind of just stay calm within the cold,

47:32.580 --> 47:33.780
 or you can lean into it.

47:33.780 --> 47:37.820
 You can actually take mental steps

47:37.820 --> 47:39.740
 to generate more adrenaline

47:39.740 --> 47:42.940
 to kind of meet the demands of that cold.

47:42.940 --> 47:44.680
 And at some point we'll do a whole episode

47:44.680 --> 47:47.780
 on how to use cold and heat to certain advantages.

47:47.780 --> 47:50.580
 We've done a little bit of this in past episodes,

47:50.580 --> 47:53.060
 using the cold to supercharge human performance

47:53.060 --> 47:54.260
 and things of that sort.

47:54.260 --> 47:58.060
 But in general, cold is measured in relative terms,

47:58.060 --> 48:00.780
 and therefore getting in all at once is a good idea

48:00.780 --> 48:02.100
 provided you can do it safely,

48:02.100 --> 48:04.760
 and heat is measured in absolute levels

48:04.760 --> 48:05.660
 by your brain and body,

48:05.660 --> 48:08.100
 and therefore you want to actually move into it gradually.

48:08.100 --> 48:11.360
 So it's kind of the inverse of what you might think.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.660
 One of the most important things to understand

48:13.660 --> 48:15.100
 about the experience of pain

48:15.100 --> 48:19.640
 and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is

48:19.640 --> 48:22.060
 is that our experience of pain

48:22.060 --> 48:24.480
 and the degree of damage to our body

48:24.480 --> 48:25.920
 are not always correlated.

48:25.920 --> 48:29.360
 And in fact, sometimes can be in opposite directions.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.780
 A good example of this would be x-rays.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.360
 We all occasionally get x-rays,

48:33.360 --> 48:35.060
 at least in the US we get x-rays

48:35.060 --> 48:36.860
 when we go to the dentist from time to time.

48:36.860 --> 48:39.240
 And the occasional x-ray might be safe

48:39.240 --> 48:40.240
 depending on who you are,

48:40.240 --> 48:42.400
 provided you're not pregnant, et cetera.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.760
 I've gone to the dentist,

48:43.760 --> 48:44.600
 they put you in the chair,

48:44.600 --> 48:45.740
 they cover you with a lead blanket,

48:45.740 --> 48:49.820
 and then they run behind the screen to protect themselves,

48:49.820 --> 48:51.160
 and they beam you with the x-rays

48:51.160 --> 48:52.800
 to get a picture of your teeth and your jaws

48:52.800 --> 48:54.540
 and your skull, et cetera.

48:54.540 --> 48:57.280
 Well, if you were to get too many x-rays,

48:57.280 --> 49:00.360
 you could severely damage the tissues of your body,

49:00.360 --> 49:03.780
 but you don't experience any pain during the x-ray itself.

49:04.940 --> 49:09.940
 In contrast, you can think that your body is damaged

49:09.980 --> 49:12.760
 and experience extreme pain,

49:12.760 --> 49:16.720
 and yet your body can have no damage.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.840
 A classic example of this was published

49:18.840 --> 49:20.840
 in the British Journal of Medicine

49:20.840 --> 49:24.080
 in which a construction worker fell from,

49:24.080 --> 49:27.440
 I think it was a second story which he was working,

49:27.440 --> 49:32.000
 and a nail went up and through his boot,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.020
 and he looked down and he saw the nail

49:35.020 --> 49:36.520
 going through his boot,

49:36.520 --> 49:39.820
 and he was in absolute excruciating pain.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.880
 They took him to the hospital,

49:42.880 --> 49:44.880
 and because the nail was so long

49:44.880 --> 49:47.640
 and because of where it had entered and exited the boot,

49:47.640 --> 49:49.560
 they had to cut away the boot

49:49.560 --> 49:52.160
 in order to get to the nail.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.240
 And when they did that,

49:53.240 --> 49:55.100
 they revealed that the nail had passed

49:55.100 --> 49:56.840
 between two of his toes.

49:56.840 --> 50:01.840
 It had actually failed to impale his body in any way.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.900
 And yet the view, the perception of that nail

50:04.900 --> 50:06.920
 entering his boot at one end

50:06.920 --> 50:08.460
 and exiting the boot at the other

50:08.460 --> 50:12.360
 was sufficient to create the experience of a nail

50:12.360 --> 50:14.320
 that had gone through his foot.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.040
 And the moment he realized

50:16.040 --> 50:18.740
 that that nail had not gone through his foot,

50:18.740 --> 50:20.760
 the pain completely evaporated.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.980
 And this has been demonstrated numerous times.

50:22.980 --> 50:24.560
 People that work in emergency rooms

50:24.560 --> 50:28.000
 actually see variations on this, not always that extreme,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.520
 but many times what we see

50:30.520 --> 50:33.700
 and how we perceive that wound or that event

50:33.700 --> 50:36.600
 has a profound influence on how we experience pain.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.720
 And I mention this not just because

50:38.720 --> 50:41.160
 it's a kind of sensational and fantastic example

50:41.160 --> 50:43.580
 of this extreme subjective nature of pain,

50:43.580 --> 50:46.280
 but also because it brings us back to this element,

50:46.280 --> 50:49.520
 which is we don't know how other people feel,

50:49.520 --> 50:51.680
 not just about pain, but about pleasure.

50:51.680 --> 50:53.500
 We think we do.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.440
 We have some general sense of whether or not an event

50:56.440 --> 50:58.800
 ought to be painful or pleasurable,

50:58.800 --> 51:01.960
 but actually we barely understand how we feel,

51:01.960 --> 51:03.640
 let alone how other people feel.

51:03.640 --> 51:07.260
 And we can be badly wrong about how we feel,

51:07.260 --> 51:11.020
 meaning we can misinterpret our own sense of pain

51:11.020 --> 51:12.800
 or our own sense of pleasure

51:12.800 --> 51:15.400
 depending on what we see with our eyes

51:15.400 --> 51:17.340
 and what we hear with our ears.

51:17.340 --> 51:20.800
 So we hear a scream, like a shrill scream,

51:20.800 --> 51:22.800
 and we think it must be pain.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.880
 And if we look at something that's happening to somebody

51:24.880 --> 51:28.460
 and it fits a prior category or a prior representation

51:28.460 --> 51:31.140
 of what we would consider painful stimulus,

51:31.140 --> 51:34.200
 well, then we think that they're in extreme pain,

51:34.200 --> 51:36.600
 but actually they might not be in pain at all.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.280
 Now, this highly subjective nature of pain

51:39.280 --> 51:41.600
 and the way in which we use our visual system

51:41.600 --> 51:45.040
 to interpret other people's pain and our own pain

51:45.040 --> 51:47.760
 has actually been leveraged to treat

51:47.760 --> 51:50.800
 a very extreme form of chronic pain.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.120
 And it's an absolutely fascinating area

51:53.120 --> 51:54.640
 of biology and neuroscience.

51:54.640 --> 51:57.200
 And it's one that we can actually all leverage

51:57.200 --> 52:00.020
 toward reducing our own levels of pain

52:00.020 --> 52:02.720
 whenever we are injured, or believe it or not,

52:02.720 --> 52:04.600
 even in chronic pain.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.120
 To describe this area of science

52:06.120 --> 52:08.880
 requires a kind of extreme example.

52:08.880 --> 52:11.400
 I want to be clear that even if you don't suffer

52:11.400 --> 52:13.540
 from this extreme example,

52:13.540 --> 52:16.280
 there's relevance and a tool to extract for you.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.880
 The extreme example is that of an amputated digit,

52:20.880 --> 52:23.680
 meaning one of your fingers or your toes,

52:23.680 --> 52:25.980
 or of an amputated limb.

52:25.980 --> 52:30.980
 So people that have digits or limbs that are gone,

52:31.000 --> 52:34.800
 missing from an injury or surgical removal,

52:34.800 --> 52:37.800
 will often have the experience that it's still there,

52:37.800 --> 52:41.100
 the so-called phantom limb phenomenon.

52:41.100 --> 52:42.720
 Now, why would that be?

52:42.720 --> 52:46.980
 Well, when you remove a particular finger or limb,

52:47.840 --> 52:50.200
 obviously that finger and limb is gone,

52:50.200 --> 52:52.600
 and the dorsal root ganglion neuron

52:52.600 --> 52:54.640
 that would normally send a wire

52:54.640 --> 52:57.140
 out to that particular region of the body,

52:57.140 --> 52:58.420
 that wire is no longer there

52:58.420 --> 53:00.820
 because that portion of the body is no longer there.

53:00.820 --> 53:03.500
 And in some cases, those neurons die,

53:03.500 --> 53:05.840
 almost always, but not always.

53:05.840 --> 53:08.600
 However, the map, your so-called homunculus,

53:08.600 --> 53:12.300
 your representation of yourself in the brain

53:12.300 --> 53:13.340
 is still there.

53:14.240 --> 53:17.640
 And this map, the so-called homunculus map

53:17.640 --> 53:20.520
 that you have and that I have is very plastic.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.600
 It can change.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.840
 And so as a consequence,

53:23.840 --> 53:26.680
 areas of the map that are adjacent to one another

53:26.680 --> 53:31.280
 can actually start to invade other areas of the map.

53:31.280 --> 53:34.840
 So for instance, there are neuroimaging studies

53:34.840 --> 53:37.400
 that have documented that somebody that has, say,

53:37.400 --> 53:39.800
 a complete removal of their left arm,

53:39.800 --> 53:43.320
 the representation of their left arm

53:43.320 --> 53:45.880
 still exists in the cortex.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.560
 And experimentally,

53:47.560 --> 53:50.560
 if one is to stimulate that area of the cortex,

53:50.560 --> 53:53.620
 that person, and if that person were you,

53:53.620 --> 53:55.900
 would experience having that arm,

53:55.900 --> 53:57.400
 that it were being stimulated,

53:57.400 --> 53:59.060
 even though it's not there.

53:59.060 --> 54:00.920
 Now, someone who has an amputated arm

54:00.920 --> 54:03.280
 doesn't need to have their brain stimulated

54:03.280 --> 54:04.960
 in order to have the experience

54:04.960 --> 54:06.920
 of that phantom limb being present.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.960
 In fact, many people who have limbs that were amputated

54:10.840 --> 54:13.600
 feel as if that limb is still present,

54:13.600 --> 54:15.520
 even though obviously it's not.

54:15.520 --> 54:18.120
 And no matter how many times they look to the stump

54:18.120 --> 54:19.660
 and just see a stump,

54:19.660 --> 54:22.880
 somehow it doesn't reorganize that homunculus

54:22.880 --> 54:25.060
 so-called central brain map.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.560
 Now, that would be fine.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.880
 You might even think that would be better,

54:29.880 --> 54:31.920
 better to think you have the arm there

54:31.920 --> 54:34.200
 than to feel as if it's missing.

54:34.200 --> 54:36.880
 And yet many people who have amputated limbs

54:36.880 --> 54:39.160
 report phantom limb pain.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.400
 They don't feel that the arm

54:40.400 --> 54:42.500
 is just casually draped next to them.

54:42.500 --> 54:45.520
 They feel as if it's bunched up and it's an extreme pain.

54:45.520 --> 54:49.440
 In fact, this kind of contorted stance

54:49.440 --> 54:50.940
 that I'm taking right here in my chair

54:50.940 --> 54:53.240
 is not unlike the way that these patients describe this.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.240
 They feel as if it's kind of cramped up.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.600
 It's very uncomfortable for them.

54:57.600 --> 55:01.360
 Now, an absolutely creative,

55:01.360 --> 55:04.280
 and you could even say genius scientist

55:04.280 --> 55:05.800
 by the name of Ramachandran,

55:05.800 --> 55:07.640
 that's actually his last name.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.940
 His complete name is a little bit more complicated.

55:09.940 --> 55:12.680
 So you all almost always hear Ramachandran

55:12.680 --> 55:15.560
 referred to as Ramachandran or VS Ramachandran

55:15.560 --> 55:20.560
 because his full name is Villayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.

55:20.840 --> 55:23.320
 So a lot of letters in there, a lot of vowels.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.960
 But Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.320
 He was actually a colleague of mine

55:28.320 --> 55:29.920
 when my lab was formerly

55:29.920 --> 55:32.000
 at the University of California, San Diego.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.720
 He's done a lot of work on this phantom limb phenomenon.

55:34.720 --> 55:37.460
 And Ramachandran actually started off as a vision scientist.

55:37.460 --> 55:40.580
 And he understood the power of the visual system

55:40.580 --> 55:44.480
 in dictating our experience of things like pain and pleasure.

55:44.480 --> 55:48.440
 And so what he developed was a very low technology

55:48.440 --> 55:52.020
 yet neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment

55:52.020 --> 55:53.800
 for phantom limb.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.760
 It consisted of a box,

55:55.760 --> 55:59.440
 literally a box that had mirrors inside of it.

55:59.440 --> 56:03.320
 And the patient would put the intact hand or limb

56:03.320 --> 56:05.000
 into one side.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.280
 And obviously they couldn't put the amputated limb

56:07.280 --> 56:08.120
 into the other side

56:08.120 --> 56:10.520
 but because of the configuration of the mirrors,

56:10.520 --> 56:14.000
 it appeared as though they had two symmetric limbs

56:14.000 --> 56:15.440
 inside the box.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.400
 And then he would have them look at that limb

56:18.400 --> 56:20.220
 and move it around.

56:20.220 --> 56:21.600
 And as they would do this,

56:21.600 --> 56:25.080
 they would report real time movement

56:25.080 --> 56:27.480
 or I should say real time perception of movement

56:27.480 --> 56:29.120
 in the phantom limb.

56:29.120 --> 56:31.720
 Now, this is absolutely incredible but makes total sense

56:31.720 --> 56:33.960
 when you think about the so-called top down

56:33.960 --> 56:37.440
 or contextual modulation of our sensory experience.

56:37.440 --> 56:39.960
 Remember, it's anticipation, it's anxiety,

56:39.960 --> 56:42.240
 it's interpretation of what's happening

56:42.240 --> 56:45.360
 that drives our perception of what's happening.

56:45.360 --> 56:48.680
 And so as he would have these patients

56:48.680 --> 56:52.160
 move their intact limb to a more relaxed position,

56:52.160 --> 56:54.480
 the patients would feel as if the phantom limb

56:54.480 --> 56:56.120
 were relaxing.

56:56.120 --> 56:59.120
 And this was used successfully to treat phantom limb pain

56:59.120 --> 57:01.000
 in a number of different people.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.200
 It didn't always work.

57:02.200 --> 57:04.120
 And you can imagine sometimes it might be a little trickier

57:04.120 --> 57:04.960
 like for a leg,

57:04.960 --> 57:06.960
 although there have been leg boxes

57:06.960 --> 57:11.480
 that have been developed and arranged for this purpose.

57:11.480 --> 57:12.980
 And what was remarkable

57:12.980 --> 57:14.680
 is that they could finish these experiments

57:14.680 --> 57:17.640
 and have the patient, the person,

57:17.640 --> 57:19.480
 enter a state of relaxation,

57:19.480 --> 57:21.240
 reduce the pain in the phantom limb,

57:21.240 --> 57:22.280
 and it would stay there

57:22.280 --> 57:25.980
 even though of course, as they exited the mirror box,

57:25.980 --> 57:27.360
 they would go about their life

57:27.360 --> 57:30.600
 and use their intact limb for its various purposes.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.640
 I love this experiment because it really speaks

57:32.640 --> 57:35.480
 to the subjective nature of pain and pleasure.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.480
 It speaks to the power of the visual system.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.560
 Like what we see,

57:38.560 --> 57:40.200
 just like the nail through the boot experiment,

57:40.200 --> 57:44.340
 what we see profoundly impacts our experience

57:44.340 --> 57:47.120
 of pleasure and pain, in this case, pain.

57:47.120 --> 57:52.040
 Now there's another aspect to the phantom limb experience

57:52.040 --> 57:53.160
 and of these maps,

57:53.160 --> 57:55.920
 the so-called homunculus maps in the cortex

57:55.920 --> 57:57.840
 that Ramachandran worked on,

57:57.840 --> 57:59.480
 which is very interesting

57:59.480 --> 58:02.860
 and reveals the degree to which these maps are plastic

58:02.860 --> 58:06.400
 or can change in response to experience.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.520
 Turns out that because of the locations

58:10.520 --> 58:14.860
 of different body part representations within these maps,

58:14.860 --> 58:16.280
 certain parts of our body

58:16.280 --> 58:18.880
 that normally we don't think of as related

58:18.880 --> 58:23.000
 can start to create merged experiences.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.220
 What do I mean by that?

58:24.220 --> 58:27.400
 Well, Ramachandran described a patient

58:27.400 --> 58:31.120
 who had a somewhat odd experience

58:31.120 --> 58:33.160
 of having lost their foot.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.760
 So they actually had their foot amputated

58:35.760 --> 58:37.360
 about midway up the Achilles,

58:37.360 --> 58:41.080
 so lower portion of the calf and foot.

58:41.080 --> 58:44.240
 I don't recall what the reason was for having it removed.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.960
 And fortunately for this patient,

58:45.960 --> 58:50.240
 they did not experience pain in that portion of their body,

58:50.240 --> 58:53.240
 but rather they confided in him

58:53.240 --> 58:56.800
 that whenever they would have sex,

58:56.800 --> 59:01.160
 they would experience their orgasm in their phantom foot

59:01.160 --> 59:03.800
 in addition to in their genitals, of course.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.240
 And Ramachandran understood the homunculus map

59:07.240 --> 59:09.640
 and he understood that this was because

59:09.640 --> 59:12.800
 the representation of the foot within the homunculus

59:12.800 --> 59:14.720
 actually lies adjacent to

59:14.720 --> 59:17.160
 and is somewhat interdigitated with,

59:17.160 --> 59:20.040
 it actually kind of merges with

59:20.040 --> 59:22.840
 the representation of the genitalia.

59:22.840 --> 59:26.460
 Now, that's a weird situation.

59:26.460 --> 59:30.920
 And yet you now know that the density of innervation

59:30.920 --> 59:32.680
 of the feet and the genitalia,

59:32.680 --> 59:34.260
 as well as the lips and the face

59:34.260 --> 59:37.840
 are actually the highest sensory innervation

59:37.840 --> 59:39.600
 that you have in your entire body.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.480
 And this speaks to, I think,

59:41.480 --> 59:44.480
 a more important general principle for all people

59:44.480 --> 59:46.800
 of the experience of pleasure or pain,

59:46.800 --> 59:50.160
 which is that an aspect of our pain or pleasure

59:50.160 --> 59:52.680
 can be highly localized, right?

59:52.680 --> 59:53.840
 It can be because of a cut

59:53.840 --> 59:55.840
 to a particular location on the body,

59:55.840 --> 59:58.920
 or it can be because, excuse me,

59:58.920 --> 1:00:02.760
 of a fall injury or a kind of bruise

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.080
 on one side of our body.

1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:06.920
 And yet our experience of pleasure and pain

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:11.160
 can also be an almost body-wide experience.

1:00:11.160 --> 1:00:13.800
 And yet it's always most rich,

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:16.400
 it's always most heightened in these regions of our body

1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:19.140
 that have dense sensory innervation.

1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:20.900
 So we experience pain and pleasure

1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:23.760
 according to local phenomenon receptors in the skin

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:25.800
 and this homunculus map that has all these

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:26.960
 different territories.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:29.900
 But because of the way that those territories are related,

1:00:29.900 --> 1:00:33.440
 this kind of wild example of somebody experiencing orgasm

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:36.600
 in their phantom foot speaks to the larger experience,

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:39.520
 the more typical, rather, experience that I should say,

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:41.120
 that all people have,

1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:44.120
 which is that pleasure can be body-wide,

1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:46.520
 or we can experience it in our face,

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:49.080
 the bottoms of our feet and other areas of the body

1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:52.080
 that we experience pleasure, and similarly with pain.

1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:55.200
 And that brings us to the topic of whole body pain,

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:59.000
 not just localized pain, as well as whole body pleasure,

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.420
 not just localized pleasure.

1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:05.160
 There are a number of examples of whole body pain

1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:06.360
 that people suffer from.

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:09.760
 And one common one is called fibromyalgia.

1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:12.240
 I want to just first share with you

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:14.120
 a little bit of medical insight.

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.000
 A few months back, I did an Instagram Live

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.920
 with Dr. Sean Mackey, who's an MD, medical doctor,

1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:23.640
 and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine.

1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:26.160
 That was recorded and placed on my Instagram.

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:27.440
 If you want to check it out,

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:30.140
 we can provide a link to that in the show notes.

1:01:30.140 --> 1:01:34.060
 Dr. Mackey is the chief of the division of pain

1:01:34.060 --> 1:01:35.900
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:38.280
 So he's a scientist, he studies pain,

1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:41.360
 and he treats patients dealing with various forms of pain,

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:45.200
 whole body pain like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:47.120
 And he shared with me something very interesting,

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.120
 which is that anytime you hear or see the word syndrome,

1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:54.680
 that means that the medical establishment

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:56.560
 does not understand what's going on.

1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:58.920
 A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms

1:01:59.980 --> 1:02:02.200
 that point in a particular direction

1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:03.820
 or some general set of directions

1:02:03.820 --> 1:02:05.480
 about what could be going on,

1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:10.480
 but it doesn't reveal a true underlying disease necessarily.

1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:12.840
 It could be a aggregate of diseases,

1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:15.320
 or it could be something else entirely.

1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:18.660
 And I want to make sure that I emphasize

1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.360
 the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.

1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:23.560
 I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic

1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:26.560
 and we interpret that as meaning all in one's head,

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:28.360
 but I think it's important to remember

1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:29.560
 that everything is neural,

1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:31.360
 whether or not it's pain in your body

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:33.620
 because you have a gaping wound

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:35.600
 and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound,

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:40.120
 or whether or not it's pain for which you cannot explain it

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.640
 on the basis of any kind of injury, it's all neural.

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:45.920
 So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic,

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:47.320
 it's kind of irrelevant,

1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:49.680
 and I hope someday we move past that language.

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:53.100
 Psychosomatic is interesting.

1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:57.200
 There was a paper that was published in 2015,

1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:00.480
 and then again in 2020, a different paper

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:03.760
 focused on the so-called psychogenic fevers

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:05.000
 or psychosomatic effects.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.380
 And I just briefly want to mention this

1:03:06.380 --> 1:03:08.660
 because it relates back to pain.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:11.760
 These studies have shown that there are areas

1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:13.000
 of the so-called thalamus,

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.720
 which integrates and filters sensory information

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:17.200
 of different kinds.

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:21.480
 And within the brainstem, an area called the DMH,

1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:24.020
 and I can also provide a link to this study if you like,

1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:28.080
 that shows that there is a true neurological basis.

1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:30.240
 There are brain areas and circuits

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:32.920
 that are related to what's called psychogenic fever.

1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:35.420
 When we are stressed, and in particular,

1:03:35.420 --> 1:03:37.580
 if we think that we were injured

1:03:37.580 --> 1:03:39.780
 or that we were infected by something,

1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:43.040
 we can actually generate a true fever.

1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:45.200
 It is not an imagined fever,

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:48.880
 it is our thinking generating an increase

1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:50.640
 in body temperature.

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.600
 And so this has been called psychosomatic,

1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:54.280
 it's been called psychogenic,

1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:56.740
 but it has a neural basis, okay?

1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:59.100
 So when we hear syndrome,

1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:01.440
 and a patient comes into a clinic

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:03.640
 and says that they suffer, for instance,

1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:06.120
 from something which is very controversial, frankly,

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:07.720
 like chronic fatigue syndrome,

1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:10.000
 some physicians believe that it reflects

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.840
 a real underlying medical condition, others don't.

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:18.180
 However, syndrome means we don't understand.

1:04:18.180 --> 1:04:21.240
 And that doesn't mean something doesn't exist.

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:25.300
 Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time

1:04:25.300 --> 1:04:28.600
 was written off or kind of explained away

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.920
 by physicians and scientists, frankly,

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:34.320
 my community, as one of these syndromes.

1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:35.480
 It couldn't be explained.

1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:38.720
 However, now there is what I would consider,

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:41.840
 and I think others would and should consider,

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:45.080
 firm understanding of at least one of the bases

1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:46.880
 for this whole body pain.

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:50.200
 And that's activation of a particular cell type

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:51.840
 called glia.

1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:53.740
 And there's a receptor on these glia,

1:04:53.740 --> 1:04:54.680
 for those of you that want to know,

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:57.060
 called the TOLE4 receptor.

1:04:57.060 --> 1:05:00.200
 And activation of the TOLE4 receptor

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.000
 is related to certain forms of whole body pain

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.920
 and fibromyalgia.

1:05:04.920 --> 1:05:08.440
 Now, what treatments exist for fibromyalgia?

1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:10.720
 And even if you don't suffer from fibromyalgia,

1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:13.160
 and even if you don't know anyone who does,

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:14.440
 this is important information

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:15.660
 because what I'm about to tell you

1:05:15.660 --> 1:05:19.200
 relates to how you and your body,

1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:20.760
 which is you of course,

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:23.080
 can deal with pain of any kind.

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:26.520
 And there are actually things that one can do and take

1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:29.520
 that can encourage nerve health in general,

1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:31.720
 in other conditions like diabetic neuropathy,

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:34.120
 but in all individuals.

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:39.120
 So there are clinical data using a prescription drug.

1:05:40.260 --> 1:05:41.520
 This is work that actually was done

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:43.900
 by Dr. Mackey and colleagues.

1:05:43.900 --> 1:05:45.360
 The drug is called naltrexone.

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:47.480
 Naltrexone is actually used for the treatment

1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:51.740
 of various opioid addictions and things of that sort.

1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:54.440
 But it turns out that a very low dose,

1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:58.760
 I believe it was a 1 10th the size of the typical dose

1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:03.320
 of naltrexone, has been shown to have some success

1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:06.620
 in dealing with and treating certain forms of fibromyalgia.

1:06:06.620 --> 1:06:09.480
 And it has that success because of its ability

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:14.320
 to bind to and block these toll-4 receptors on glia.

1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:16.180
 So this so-called syndrome,

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:18.020
 or this thing that previously was called a syndrome,

1:06:18.020 --> 1:06:21.200
 fibromyalgia, actually has a biological basis.

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:23.620
 It was not just in patients' heads.

1:06:23.620 --> 1:06:26.540
 And I really tip my hat to the medical establishment,

1:06:26.540 --> 1:06:28.440
 including Dr. Mackey and others,

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:32.040
 who explored the potential underlying biologies

1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:33.200
 of things like fibromyalgia

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:35.000
 and are starting to arrive at treatments.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.040
 Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor,

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.560
 so I'm not prescribing anything.

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:39.940
 You should talk to your doctor, of course,

1:06:39.940 --> 1:06:43.120
 if you have fibromyalgia or other forms of chronic

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:45.460
 or whole body pain to explore whether or not

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:48.820
 these low dose naltrexone treatments are right for you.

1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:51.600
 But I think it's a beautiful case study, if you will,

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.300
 not a case study of an individual patient,

1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:58.300
 but a case in study of linking up the patient's self-report

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:00.760
 of these experiences and using science

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.460
 to trying to establish clinical treatments.

1:07:03.460 --> 1:07:05.240
 There's another treatment,

1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:06.880
 or I should say there's another approach

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:07.720
 that one could take.

1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:10.180
 And again, I'm not recommending people do this necessarily.

1:07:10.180 --> 1:07:12.280
 You have to determine what's right and safe for you.

1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:13.400
 I cannot do that.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:14.240
 There's no way.

1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:15.720
 Your situation's very far too much,

1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:18.260
 and it would be outside of my wheelhouse

1:07:18.260 --> 1:07:19.680
 to prescribe anything.

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:22.800
 But there's a particular compound,

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:25.160
 which in the United States is sold over the counter,

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:26.680
 and in Europe is prescription.

1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:28.940
 It's one that I've talked about on this podcast before

1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:30.120
 for other purposes.

1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:34.200
 And that compound is acetyl L-carnitine.

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:35.960
 Acetyl L-carnitine, as I mentioned,

1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:38.480
 is by prescription in most countries in Europe.

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:41.220
 In the US, you can buy this over the counter.

1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:44.200
 There is evidence that acetyl L-carnitine

1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:46.880
 can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body pain

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:49.960
 and other certain forms of acute pain

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:53.120
 at dosages of somewhere between one to three

1:07:53.120 --> 1:07:55.440
 and sometimes four grams per day.

1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:58.000
 Now, acetyl L-carnitine can be taken orally.

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.720
 It's found in 500 milligram capsules,

1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:03.240
 as well as by injection.

1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:06.600
 By injection in the States, in the United States that is,

1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:08.320
 also requires a prescription,

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.920
 or requires a prescription, I should say.

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:13.240
 The over the counter forms are generally capsules

1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:14.520
 or powders.

1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:17.560
 Those apparently do not require a prescription.

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:20.480
 There are several studies exploring acetyl L-carnitine

1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:23.920
 in this context, as well as for diabetic neuropathy.

1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:25.840
 And what's interesting about acetyl L-carnitine

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.000
 is it's one of the few compounds

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:31.620
 that isn't just used for the treatment of pain,

1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:34.200
 but has also been shown in certain contexts

1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:37.760
 to improve peripheral nerve health generally.

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:40.480
 And for that reason, it's an interesting compound.

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.240
 I've also talked about acetyl L-carnitine

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:46.080
 on here previously because it has robust effects

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:49.460
 on things like sperm motility and health,

1:08:49.460 --> 1:08:52.920
 including the speeds at which sperm swim,

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:54.000
 how straight they swim.

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.440
 Turns out that swimming for sperm is more efficient

1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:58.540
 if they swim straight,

1:08:58.540 --> 1:09:02.400
 as opposed to like those kids on the swim team

1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:04.080
 that are like banging up against the lane lines

1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:06.200
 and zigzagging all over the place.

1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:10.680
 So it does turn out to be the case that the quickest route

1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:12.880
 between any two places is a straight line.

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:14.440
 And the good sperm know that,

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:16.440
 and the less good sperm don't seem to know that.

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.740
 And acetyl L-carnitine seems to facilitate

1:09:18.740 --> 1:09:20.540
 straight swimming trajectories,

1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:23.140
 as well as speed of swimming and overall sperm health.

1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:26.760
 And there is evidence from quality peer-reviewed studies

1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:29.460
 showing that acetyl L-carnitine supplementation

1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:32.260
 can also be beneficial for women's fertility

1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:34.440
 in ways that it affects perhaps,

1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:36.560
 we don't really know the mechanism,

1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:39.760
 health and status of the egg or egg implantation.

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.200
 There are a large number of studies on acetyl L-carnitine.

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:44.640
 You can look those up on PubMed if you like,

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.680
 or on examine.com.

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:49.180
 There are some studies that I don't think are included there

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:50.360
 which are particularly interesting.

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:54.560
 One that I just would like to reference the last,

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:58.200
 the last name of the first author is Mahdavi.

1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:01.260
 So M-A-H-D-A-V-I.

1:10:01.260 --> 1:10:04.080
 The title of the paper is effects of L-carnitine

1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:07.040
 supplementation on serum inflammatory markers

1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:09.760
 and matrix metalloprotease enzymes

1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:12.080
 in females with knee osteoarthritis.

1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:13.880
 So this is a randomized double-blind

1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:15.520
 placebo controlled pilot study

1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:17.680
 that showed really interesting effects

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:21.400
 of short-term supplementation of acetyl L-carnitine.

1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:24.200
 Longer term, the effects were less impressive.

1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:26.200
 So it's pretty interesting that this compound

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:27.200
 has so many different effects.

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:28.320
 How could it have these effects?

1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:30.360
 Well, it appears that it's having these effects

1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.040
 through its impact on the so-called inflammatory cytokines.

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:38.000
 Inflammatory cytokines for those of you that don't know

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.720
 are secreted by the immune system

1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:42.080
 in response to different stressors,

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:44.680
 physical stressors, mental stressors too,

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.720
 food that you eat that isn't good for you.

1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:49.160
 The so-called hidden sugars,

1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:51.760
 yes, will increase inflammation

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:53.220
 if they're ingested too often

1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:55.700
 or in amounts that are too high in quantity.

1:10:55.700 --> 1:10:57.900
 Things like interleukin-1 beta,

1:10:57.900 --> 1:10:59.680
 things like C-reactive protein,

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:01.200
 things like interleukin-6.

1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:04.220
 Interleukin-6 is kind of the generic inflammatory marker

1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:05.440
 that all studies refer to.

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:07.440
 And yet there are other interleukins,

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:09.880
 please note that there are other interleukins

1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:13.380
 like interleukin-10 that are anti-inflammatory.

1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:16.480
 So your immune system can secrete inflammatory molecules

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:18.680
 to deal with wounds and stress and things.

1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:19.920
 And in the short term, that's good.

1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:21.600
 And in the long term, that's bad.

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.600
 And it can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10.

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.660
 And these matrix metalloproteases, it's kind of a mouthful,

1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:33.000
 but these matrix metalloproteases are very interesting.

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.360
 Anytime you see ACE, that's generally an enzyme,

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.840
 which means that these compounds in this case,

1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:42.320
 these matrix metalloproteases

1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:47.280
 are used to break down certain elements around wounds

1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:49.760
 and scarring, which might sound like a bad thing,

1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:53.120
 but in some cases is good because it allows certain cells,

1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:55.040
 like glial cells, so-called microglia,

1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:56.520
 to come in like little ambulances,

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.360
 like little paramedics and clean up wounds.

1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:02.580
 So scarring and inflammation is kind of a double-edged sword.

1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:05.100
 It can be good, but too much scarring,

1:12:05.100 --> 1:12:06.820
 if it contains a wound too much,

1:12:06.820 --> 1:12:09.000
 doesn't allow the infiltration of cell types

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.720
 to move in and take care of that wound and heal it up.

1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:14.200
 So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:17.040
 a number of different processes, both to impact pain

1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:19.160
 and perhaps, and I want to underscore perhaps,

1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:21.200
 but there are good studies happening now,

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:25.640
 perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.

1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:28.200
 As long as we're talking about acute pain and chronic pain

1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:31.000
 and supplementation and non-prescription drugs,

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.040
 at least in the United States,

1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:34.940
 that people can take to deal with pain of various kinds.

1:12:34.940 --> 1:12:36.880
 I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.680
 that I get asked most often about, which are agmatine

1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:45.680
 and S-adenosylmethionine, which is sometimes called SAMe.

1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:50.360
 Both of those have been shown to have some impact,

1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:54.480
 categorized on examine as notable impact

1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:58.160
 on various forms of pain due to osteoarthritis

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.800
 or due to injury of various kinds

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:02.440
 in different subject population,

1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:05.320
 men, women, people of different ages, et cetera.

1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.660
 SAMe in particular has been interesting

1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:10.880
 because it's been shown head to head with drugs

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.300
 like naproxen and other drugs of that sort,

1:13:14.300 --> 1:13:17.820
 which are well established and sold over the counter

1:13:17.820 --> 1:13:20.960
 in the US to work at least as well

1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:23.980
 as some of those compounds at certain dosages.

1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:27.040
 But it's also been shown that SAMe

1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:29.220
 and some of those things take more time

1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:31.500
 in order to have those effects.

1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:34.600
 In fact, head to head with things like naproxen

1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:37.040
 have been shown that they can take up to a month

1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:39.260
 in order to have the pain relieving effect.

1:13:39.260 --> 1:13:40.940
 Now, whether or not that makes them a better choice

1:13:40.940 --> 1:13:43.600
 or a worse choice really depends on your circumstances.

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:46.300
 I'm certainly not recommending that anybody take anything,

1:13:46.300 --> 1:13:48.040
 but I do think it's interesting and important

1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:50.400
 to point out that things like agmatine,

1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:52.280
 things like SAMe have been shown

1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:55.600
 under certain circumstances to be beneficial for pain.

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:57.980
 And they are outside the realm of prescription drugs.

1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:00.220
 And I think this is a growing area of,

1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:01.320
 some people call them supplements,

1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:03.480
 some people call them nutraceuticals.

1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:04.400
 Look, at the end of the day,

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:06.920
 these are compounds that affect cellular processes

1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:07.900
 and the more that we understand

1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:09.980
 how they affect those cellular processes,

1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:13.060
 as we now do for things like acetyl-L-carnitine,

1:14:13.060 --> 1:14:15.420
 I think the more trust that we can put into them

1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:19.100
 or the more to which we might want to avoid them

1:14:19.100 --> 1:14:21.700
 because of some of the side effects or contraindications

1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:23.320
 that those compounds could have.

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:25.680
 If you're interested in those other compounds,

1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:28.760
 I do invite you, as I always do, to check out examine.com,

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:31.400
 but also to do your research on those compounds

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.020
 by simply putting them into Google

1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:35.340
 or putting them into PubMed, which would be even better.

1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:37.200
 And if you are going to go into PubMed,

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:39.120
 if you're going to start playing scientists,

1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:41.240
 which I do encourage you to do,

1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:43.600
 I would encourage you to not just read abstracts,

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:45.820
 but if you can, if the studies are freely available,

1:14:45.820 --> 1:14:48.040
 I realize not all of them are freely available,

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:49.200
 to try and read those studies,

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.680
 at least to the extent that you can.

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:54.040
 There's a particularly nice study that you might look at

1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:57.440
 that was published in 2010 in Pain Medicine,

1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.440
 which is K-Nan et al, K-E-Y-N-A-N,

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:03.300
 which looked at the safety and efficacy

1:15:03.300 --> 1:15:05.480
 of dietary-agmentine sulfate

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:10.400
 on lumbar disc-associated radiculopathy.

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.880
 I'm not laughing at the condition.

1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:16.880
 It's a painful condition that describes,

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.420
 it's kind of a range of symptoms

1:15:18.420 --> 1:15:20.160
 that relate to pinching of nerves.

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:23.120
 The spinal columns, I was laughing at my pronunciation of it.

1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:25.520
 That particular study is quite good.

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:28.520
 And the conclusion of that study that they drew

1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:31.520
 was that there were limited side effects

1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:33.680
 and that dietary-agmentine sulfate

1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:36.640
 is safe and efficacious for treating and alleviating pain

1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:38.440
 and improving quality of life

1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:40.840
 in lumbar disc-associated pain.

1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:45.120
 However, there were very specific dosage regimens,

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:47.080
 excuse me, that were described there

1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:48.200
 and duration of treatment.

1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:50.360
 And so you should not take anything that I say

1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:52.460
 or that study to mean that you can just take this stuff

1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:56.000
 willy-nilly or at any concentration, of course, or dose.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.280
 You always want to pay attention to what the science says.

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:02.000
 That paper, fortunately, is freely available online

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.220
 and we will also provide a link to that study.

1:16:04.220 --> 1:16:06.460
 For those of you that are interested in SAMe

1:16:06.460 --> 1:16:10.140
 and its usage for the treatment of various types of pain

1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:12.680
 and perhaps other benefits,

1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:15.880
 a number of companies have stopped making SAMe.

1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:18.280
 Instead, what they're now focusing on

1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:22.120
 is what they think is a better or more bioavailable

1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:25.720
 alternative, which is 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate

1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:30.140
 or 5-MTHF.

1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:33.520
 This molecule is necessary for converting homocysteine

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:37.280
 to methionine, which is then converted to SAMe.

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:40.560
 So rather than taking SAMe directly,

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:43.640
 the idea is to take something that's upstream of SAMe

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.540
 and make more SAMe endogenously available.

1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:47.960
 This is a different strategy.

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:49.840
 I've talked about this strategy before

1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:53.240
 for increasing other things like growth hormone, et cetera.

1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:55.400
 There's always this question of whether or not

1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:58.040
 in trying to increase the amount of a particular molecule

1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:00.440
 in the body, whether or not taking that specific molecule

1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:03.600
 is the best thing or working further upstream

1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:07.240
 as it's referred to, working on the precursor

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:09.040
 or increasing the levels of the precursor

1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:10.200
 is the better way to go.

1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:16.120
 It appears that this 5-MTHF is the strategy

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:21.120
 that people are now taking in place of taking SAMe directly.

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:22.360
 So in other words, they're taking this

1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:25.400
 in order to get elevated levels of SAMe.

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:29.000
 Now I'd like to turn our attention to a completely non-drug,

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.080
 non-supplement related approach to dealing with pain.

1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:36.920
 And it's one that has existed for thousands of years.

1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:41.140
 And that only recently has the Western scientific community

1:17:41.140 --> 1:17:43.780
 started to pay serious attention to,

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:46.800
 but they have started to pay serious attention to it.

1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:50.000
 And there is terrific mechanistic science

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:55.000
 to now explain how and why acupuncture can work very well

1:17:55.560 --> 1:17:58.060
 for the treatment of certain forms of pain.

1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:01.560
 Now, first off, I want to tell you what was told to me

1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:04.440
 by our director or chief of the pain division

1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:06.960
 at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.720
 which was that some people respond very well to acupuncture

1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:13.560
 and others do not.

1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:17.440
 And the challenge is identifying who will respond well

1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:19.720
 and who won't respond well.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:21.240
 Now, when I say won't respond well,

1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:23.800
 that doesn't necessarily mean that they responded

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:26.480
 in a negative way, that it was bad for them.

1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:29.860
 But it does appear that a fraction of people

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:33.000
 experience tremendous pain relief from acupuncture

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.840
 and others experience none at all or very little

1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:37.360
 to the point where they have to seek out

1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:38.640
 other forms of treatment.

1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:42.600
 The science on this is still ongoing.

1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:44.760
 There was actually an excellent paper published on this

1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:47.000
 in the Journal of the American Medical Association,

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.580
 one of the premier medical clinical journals.

1:18:50.580 --> 1:18:52.720
 And it basically reinforced the idea

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:55.180
 that you have responders and non-responders.

1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:59.000
 A number of laboratories have started to explore

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.200
 how acupuncture works.

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:03.720
 And one of the premier laboratories for this

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:07.720
 is Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School.

1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:11.440
 Chufu has spent many years studying the pain system

1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:13.920
 and a system that's related to the pain system,

1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:16.640
 which is the system that controls our sensation

1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:17.580
 of itch.

1:19:18.820 --> 1:19:21.200
 Just as a brief aside about itch,

1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:25.440
 itch and pain are often co-associated with one another.

1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:27.640
 I was recently in Texas and I will tell you,

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:29.960
 they have some mean mosquitoes.

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:32.560
 They're small, but whatever they're injecting

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:34.720
 into your skin, well, here I am talking now

1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:36.120
 about my subjective experience of pain.

1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:39.360
 Whatever they injected into my skin felt to me

1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:43.120
 like the most extreme mosquito bites I've ever had.

1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:44.780
 Not while they were biting me,

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:46.160
 not while they were injecting the venom,

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:50.600
 but boy, do those Texan mosquitoes make me itch.

1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:51.440
 How do they do it?

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:55.520
 Well, their venom creates little packets

1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:58.400
 of so-called histamine that travel around.

1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:01.040
 Those packets are called mast cells,

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:03.320
 little packets of histamine that go to that location

1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:05.600
 and make me, and presumably you,

1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:07.820
 want to scratch those mosquito bites.

1:20:07.820 --> 1:20:09.040
 I scratch mine, you scratch yours,

1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:11.240
 but we both scratch our mosquito bites.

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:13.120
 And when we do that, the histamines are released,

1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:15.960
 it gets red and inflamed, and they itch even worse.

1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:19.200
 The inflammation is actually caused by the histamine.

1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:24.200
 Well, that experience of inflammation and pain and itch

1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:30.020
 is what we call a pre-rogenic experience, okay?

1:20:30.020 --> 1:20:33.640
 So we have pain, which is nociception, essentially.

1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:36.240
 I know that the pain aficionados always get a little upset

1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:37.520
 because they say, oh, there's no such thing

1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:38.700
 as a pain receptor.

1:20:38.700 --> 1:20:40.120
 It's nociceptive receptors,

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:41.760
 and pain is subjective experience.

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:44.800
 Yes, I acknowledge all that, but for fluency,

1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:47.520
 let's just think about pain as a certain experience

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:49.060
 and itch as a separate experience,

1:20:49.060 --> 1:20:52.320
 but they often exist together because those mosquito bites

1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:55.880
 were what I would call painful, or at least not pleasant.

1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:58.380
 They didn't just itch, they were also painful,

1:20:58.380 --> 1:21:01.760
 and that's because itch brings with it inflammation,

1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:04.760
 and inflammation often brings with it pain relief,

1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:07.640
 but it can also bring with it the sensation of pain.

1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:10.600
 So itch and pain are two separate phenomenon.

1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:12.400
 It was actually discovered

1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:14.320
 through a really interesting phenomenon

1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:16.640
 that relates to something that is actually consumed

1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:20.440
 in supplement form, which is this tropical legume.

1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:23.640
 It's actually a bean called mucuna purines.

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:26.880
 That's M-U-C-U-N-A, that's one word.

1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:31.880
 P-R-U-I-E-N-S, mucuna purines is a bean.

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:37.280
 It's this legume that this bean is 99% L-DOPA.

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.040
 It's dopamine, or rather it's the precursor to dopamine,

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:42.400
 and people buy this stuff and take it over the counter

1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:44.640
 as ways to increase their levels of dopamine.

1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:47.480
 It does make you feel really dopamine doubt.

1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:49.600
 I mean, it makes you feel a little high

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:52.360
 and really motivated and really energetic,

1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:55.080
 a lot like other drugs that will do that.

1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:57.800
 I don't necessarily recommend taking mucuna purines.

1:21:57.800 --> 1:21:59.980
 I personally don't like taking it.

1:21:59.980 --> 1:22:01.120
 It doesn't make me feel good.

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:03.840
 I crash really hard when I take it.

1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:06.280
 But on the outside of this bean

1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:10.480
 is a compound that makes people itch, okay?

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:12.600
 So they remove this when you take it in supplement form.

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.540
 In fact, it's usually in capsule form.

1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:18.000
 But the outside of this bean is like a hairy bean, right?

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:21.360
 And those little hairs contain a compound

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:23.960
 which was actually used to study

1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:27.080
 and identify these itch receptors in the skin.

1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.040
 So we don't have time to go into all the details of itch,

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:31.240
 but it's pretty interesting

1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:33.020
 that you have these compounds out in nature

1:22:33.020 --> 1:22:33.960
 that can make us itch.

1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:35.520
 Inside them, they have dopamine.

1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:36.480
 I mean, this is really weird,

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:38.860
 but plant compounds are really powerful.

1:22:38.860 --> 1:22:40.560
 So don't let anyone tell you

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:42.820
 that because something's from a plant or an herb,

1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:44.320
 that it's not powerful.

1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:47.440
 There are very powerful plant and herb compounds,

1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:48.880
 mucuna purines being one of them

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:52.240
 with dopamine on the inside and itchy stuff on the outside.

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.600
 Now, what does this all have to do with acupuncture?

1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:56.880
 Well, Chufu Ma's lab

1:22:56.880 --> 1:23:00.080
 has not just identified the itch pathway,

1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:02.680
 these puridogens as they're called, which cause itch,

1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:04.880
 and the purigenic phenomenon

1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:07.200
 of itch being separate from pain.

1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:12.200
 His lab has also studied how acupuncture causes relief of,

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:16.080
 but also can exacerbate pain.

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:18.040
 Now, the form of acupuncture that they explored

1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:20.640
 was one that's commonly in use called electroacupuncture.

1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:23.040
 So this isn't just putting little needles

1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:24.960
 into different parts of the body.

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:28.700
 These needles are able to pass an electrical current,

1:23:28.700 --> 1:23:30.460
 not magically, but because they have a little wire

1:23:30.460 --> 1:23:32.720
 going back to a device and you can pass electrical current.

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:33.880
 Here's what they found.

1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:36.040
 There's a public, this is a study, excuse me,

1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.320
 published in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal,

1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:40.440
 excellent journal, very high stringency.

1:23:40.440 --> 1:23:42.240
 So what Chufu Ma's lab found

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:44.960
 was that if electroacupuncture

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:48.300
 is provided to the abdomen, to the stomach area,

1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:51.640
 it creates activation

1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:53.360
 of what are called the sympathetic ganglia.

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:55.920
 These have nothing to do with sympathy in the emotional sense

1:23:55.920 --> 1:23:58.280
 has to do with the stress response.

1:23:58.280 --> 1:23:59.600
 Sympa just means together.

1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:02.560
 So it activated a bunch of neurons along the spinal cord

1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:07.560
 and the activation of these neurons involves noradrenaline

1:24:08.380 --> 1:24:12.960
 and something called NPY, neuropeptide Y.

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:15.600
 The long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:20.600
 with electroacupuncture was either anti-inflammatory

1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:22.600
 or it could cause inflammation.

1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:24.680
 It could actually exacerbate inflammation

1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.780
 depending on whether or not it was of low or high intensity.

1:24:28.780 --> 1:24:30.980
 Now that makes it a very precarious technique.

1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:33.320
 And this may speak to some of the reason

1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:36.280
 why some people report relief from acupuncture

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:37.740
 and others do not.

1:24:37.740 --> 1:24:39.640
 However, they went a step further

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:42.000
 and stimulated other areas of the body

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.200
 using electroacupuncture.

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:46.040
 And what they found is that stimulation of the legs,

1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:47.900
 of the hind limbs as it's called in animals

1:24:47.900 --> 1:24:51.360
 and the legs in humans caused a circuit,

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:55.120
 a neural circuit to be activated that goes from the legs

1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:59.480
 up to an area of the base of the brain called the DMV,

1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:01.280
 not the DMH, which I mentioned earlier,

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.320
 but the DMV, like you go to the DMV,

1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:06.200
 which is a miserable experience for most people,

1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:09.280
 forgive me, DMV employees, but let's be honest,

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:13.120
 most people don't enjoy going to the DMV as patrons,

1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:15.000
 but we have to, so we go.

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:19.400
 The DMV and low intensity stimulation,

1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:23.900
 this electroacupuncture of the hind limbs activated the DMV

1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:25.800
 and activated the adrenal glands,

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:30.080
 which sit atop your kidneys and cause the release

1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:31.800
 of what are called catecholamines.

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:35.300
 And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.

1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:39.880
 In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and feet

1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:43.060
 can if done correctly be anti-inflammatory

1:25:43.060 --> 1:25:45.100
 and reduce symptoms of pain.

1:25:45.100 --> 1:25:48.360
 And can we think accelerate wound healing

1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:51.880
 because activations of these catecholaminergic pathways

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:54.080
 can accelerate wound healing as well.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:58.320
 So the takeaway from this is that while there are thousands

1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:02.820
 of years and millions of subjects involved in explorations

1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:06.200
 of electroacupuncture and acupuncture,

1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:08.960
 Western medicine is starting to come into this

1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:11.040
 and start to explore underlying mechanism.

1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:13.280
 Now, for those of you that love acupuncture

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.040
 and are real proponents of it, it's worked for you.

1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:19.240
 You might say, well, why does Western medicine

1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:20.280
 even need to come into this?

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:22.320
 Why should they even be exploring this?

1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:24.360
 But we should all be relieved that they are

1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:26.840
 because what's starting to happen now

1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:29.500
 is that as the mechanistic basis for this

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.520
 is starting to come to light,

1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:35.960
 insurance coverage of things like acupuncture

1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:38.120
 is starting to emerge as well.

1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:40.360
 And this is in contrast to other therapies

1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:42.960
 for which there's a lot of anecdotal evidence

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:45.120
 but very little mechanistic understanding.

1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:48.600
 One example of that would be laser photobiomodulation,

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:52.360
 the use of lasers of different types really

1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:54.640
 to treat pain and to accelerate wound healing.

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:57.560
 A lot of people claim that this can really help them.

1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:00.480
 However, most places, at least in the States,

1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:01.760
 won't cover this with insurance

1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:04.520
 or don't perform this in standard clinics.

1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:08.300
 And the reason is the underlying mechanism isn't known.

1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:09.660
 I'm not going to get into the argument

1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:12.080
 about whether or not mechanistic understanding

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:14.640
 should or should not be required

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.760
 in order to have insurance coverage of things that work.

1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:19.080
 That's not what this is about.

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:21.320
 And that actually would be a boring discussion

1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:23.640
 because I'm shouting in a tunnel through you

1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:25.280
 and I wouldn't be able to hear you shout back

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:27.200
 no matter what your stance on that is.

1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:31.260
 But just trust me when I say that I am both relieved

1:27:31.260 --> 1:27:35.000
 and delighted to hear that excellent medical institutions

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.680
 like Stanford are starting to think about

1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:39.720
 electro-acupuncture and how it can work,

1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:41.700
 that places like Harvard Medical School

1:27:41.700 --> 1:27:44.240
 are starting to explore this at a mechanistic level.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:46.800
 And I do believe that there's an open-mindedness

1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:48.620
 that's starting to emerge.

1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:51.960
 For instance, the National Institutes of Health

1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:54.040
 not only has an Institute for Mental Health

1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:55.720
 and Cancer Research and an Eye Institute,

1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:59.640
 but now Complementary Health, the so-called NCCIH,

1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:01.920
 National Institutes of Complementary Health,

1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:04.600
 that is exploring things like electro-acupuncture,

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:08.040
 meditation, various supplements and things of those sort.

1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:09.580
 I do think that we're entering a new realm

1:28:09.580 --> 1:28:11.660
 in which things like pain and pain management

1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:14.780
 will be met with more openness by all physicians.

1:28:14.780 --> 1:28:15.920
 At least that's my hope.

1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:17.840
 So please take that into consideration.

1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:20.520
 Right now, the mechanistic evidence

1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:23.160
 for laser photobiomodulation is not strong.

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:27.260
 One of the major issues or the barriers to that

1:28:27.260 --> 1:28:30.440
 is that most of the studies that are out there

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:33.000
 were actually paid for by companies

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:38.000
 that build devices for laser photobiomodulation.

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:40.340
 And so we really need independent studies

1:28:40.340 --> 1:28:43.220
 funded by federal institutions that have no bias

1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:46.880
 or financial relationship in order to gain trust

1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.760
 in whatever data happened to emerge.

1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:51.640
 There is a technique that at one time

1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:53.060
 was considered alternative,

1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:55.880
 but now has a lot of mechanistic science

1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:57.320
 to explain how it works.

1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:01.340
 And it does indeed work for the treatment of chronic

1:29:01.340 --> 1:29:03.840
 and also for acute pain.

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:08.560
 And that treatment is hypnosis, in particular, self-hypnosis.

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:12.160
 Now, my colleague at Stanford, in fact, my collaborator,

1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:14.920
 Dr. David Spiegel, our associate chair of psychiatry,

1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:16.640
 has devoted his professional life

1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:20.280
 to developing hypnosis tools that people can use

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:22.460
 to help them sleep better, focus better,

1:29:22.460 --> 1:29:24.700
 stay motivated, et cetera.

1:29:24.700 --> 1:29:26.640
 While most people hear hypnosis and they think,

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.040
 oh, this is staged hypnosis,

1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:29.440
 people walking around like chickens

1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:33.080
 or being forced to laugh or fall asleep on command, et cetera,

1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:34.560
 this is completely different than all that.

1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:36.040
 This is self-hypnosis.

1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:39.560
 And there are now dozens, if not more,

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.240
 quality peer-reviewed studies

1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.000
 published in excellent journals

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.520
 done by Dr. Spiegel and others at other universities.

1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:50.600
 It really all has to do with how self-hypnosis

1:29:50.600 --> 1:29:54.560
 can modulate activity of the prefrontal cortex

1:29:54.560 --> 1:29:57.200
 and related structures like the insula.

1:29:57.200 --> 1:29:59.440
 The prefrontal cortex is involved

1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:02.800
 in our executive function, as it's called,

1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:04.280
 our planning, our decision-making,

1:30:04.280 --> 1:30:07.160
 but also how we interpret context,

1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:10.120
 what the meaning of a given sensation is.

1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:12.120
 And that's extremely powerful.

1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:13.660
 Just want to remind everybody

1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:16.060
 that the currency of the brain and body

1:30:16.060 --> 1:30:18.640
 has not changed in hundreds of thousands of years.

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:21.800
 It's always been dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA,

1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:23.300
 testosterone, estrogen.

1:30:23.300 --> 1:30:25.560
 What's changed are the contingencies,

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:27.600
 the events in the world that drive

1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:29.280
 whether or not we get an increase or decrease

1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:31.060
 in testosterone or estrogen,

1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:32.480
 the events in the world that dictate

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:36.000
 whether or not we get an increase or a decrease in dopamine.

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.720
 Believe me, the events that drove those increases

1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:40.040
 and decreases were very different,

1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:42.440
 even a hundred years ago than they are now.

1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:45.880
 And as we create new things and societies change, et cetera,

1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:50.400
 they will continue to exchange information

1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:52.960
 in the same currency, which is dopamine, serotonin,

1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:55.400
 and all these other neuromodulators and chemicals.

1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:58.040
 Hypnosis takes advantage of this

1:30:58.040 --> 1:31:02.000
 by allowing an individual, you if you like,

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.560
 to change the way that you interpret particular events

1:31:04.560 --> 1:31:06.940
 and to actually experience what would be painful

1:31:06.940 --> 1:31:09.200
 as less painful or not painful.

1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:10.480
 And that's just the example of pain.

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:12.880
 Hypnosis is powerful for other reasons too.

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:15.640
 It actually can help rewire neural circuits

1:31:15.640 --> 1:31:18.120
 so that you don't experience as much pain

1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:20.160
 so that you can sleep faster, focus faster.

1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:23.480
 If this is all sounding very fantastical,

1:31:23.480 --> 1:31:26.060
 well, it's supported by data.

1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:30.020
 The data are that when people do self-hypnosis,

1:31:30.020 --> 1:31:33.200
 even brief self-hypnosis of 10 or 15 minutes

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:36.640
 a few times a week, maybe even return to that hypnosis

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:39.360
 by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:43.360
 they can achieve significant and often very impressive

1:31:43.360 --> 1:31:46.200
 degrees of pain relief and chronic pain,

1:31:46.200 --> 1:31:47.760
 whether or not that chronic pain arises

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:50.660
 through things like fibromyalgia or through other sources.

1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:52.160
 If you want to check this out,

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:54.200
 there's a wonderful zero cost resource

1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:56.240
 that's grounded in this work.

1:31:56.240 --> 1:31:59.800
 It's the app, reveri.com.

1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:03.680
 So R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:08.440
 There you can download a zero cost app for Apple phones

1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:10.340
 or for Android phones.

1:32:10.340 --> 1:32:12.680
 And there are a variety of different hypnosis scripts.

1:32:12.680 --> 1:32:14.280
 These are actually self-hypnosis scripts,

1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:17.160
 and you'll actually hear Dr. David Spiegel talking to you.

1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:19.680
 He can teach you about hypnosis and how it works.

1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:21.440
 There are links to scientific studies

1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:24.920
 at that web address that I gave you before, reveri.com.

1:32:24.920 --> 1:32:27.280
 You can see the various studies and the various writeups

1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:29.560
 related to those studies and how this all works.

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:31.320
 And they're simple protocols.

1:32:31.320 --> 1:32:32.840
 You just click on a tab and you listen

1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:36.160
 to the self-hypnosis and it will take you into hypnosis.

1:32:36.160 --> 1:32:38.560
 And several of those hypnosis scripts

1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:40.600
 have been shown clinically

1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:44.200
 to relieve certain patterns of chronic pain.

1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:45.680
 So it's a powerful tool.

1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:48.760
 And I encourage you not to write off the non-drug,

1:32:48.760 --> 1:32:51.560
 non-supplement tools as less than powerful,

1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.760
 because indeed many people experience

1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.240
 tremendous relief from them.

1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:57.800
 And of course they also can be combined

1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.120
 with drug treatments, if that's right for you,

1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:03.200
 or with supplements and things of that sort to treat pain,

1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:04.680
 if that's right for you.

1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:07.320
 So again, electroacupuncture,

1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:11.200
 now often supported by insurance, not always, but often,

1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:13.840
 great mechanistic data starting to emerge.

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:17.280
 Hypnosis, terrific tool.

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:19.000
 There's even the self-hypnosis tool

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.920
 that one can access through the zero-cost app, Reverie,

1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:24.920
 and lots of great clinical data

1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:26.640
 and scientific mechanistic data.

1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:27.920
 There are neuroimaging studies

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:30.280
 showing the different brain areas are activated in hypnosis,

1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:32.320
 the so-called default network,

1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:35.180
 kind of where your brain kind of idols

1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:38.000
 and the different circuits that are active at rest

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.220
 shift with hypnosis and shift long-term

1:33:40.220 --> 1:33:42.360
 in ways that positively conserve you.

1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:45.200
 And then these things like laser photobiomodulation,

1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:48.680
 still more or less in that experimental medical community,

1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:51.320
 I should say Western medical community, not so certain,

1:33:51.320 --> 1:33:53.520
 but hopefully there will be data soon.

1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:55.920
 And hopefully those data will point to mechanisms

1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:58.400
 that allow the insurance companies

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:03.320
 and other sort of medical bodies to support them

1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:06.060
 if indeed they have a mechanistic basis.

1:34:06.060 --> 1:34:08.560
 I just want to briefly touch on a common method

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:12.140
 of pain relief that speaks to a more general principle

1:34:12.140 --> 1:34:14.400
 of how things like electroacupuncture

1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:17.120
 and also some of these new emerging techniques

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.980
 of kind of like active tissue release

1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:21.840
 and this principle that you hear a lot about

1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:22.880
 in sports medicine now,

1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:25.200
 that when you have pain or injury at one site,

1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:28.000
 that you should provide pressure above and below that site.

1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:29.940
 You may have seen this in the Olympics,

1:34:29.940 --> 1:34:31.760
 which is ongoing now,

1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:34.680
 where people will put tape on their body

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:35.720
 at certain locations.

1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:38.900
 Oftentimes the logic or what they're saying

1:34:38.900 --> 1:34:42.120
 is that this is designed to create relief in a joint

1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:45.080
 or in a limb that's below the tape,

1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:48.180
 not necessarily under the tape, but above or below.

1:34:48.180 --> 1:34:50.020
 So for instance, if there's pain in one shoulder,

1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:53.000
 sometimes they will put it on the trapezius muscle

1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:53.840
 or things of that sort.

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:56.000
 It turns out that there is a basis for this

1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.240
 because of the way that these different nerves

1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:01.160
 run in from the skin and from the muscles

1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:04.320
 up into the spinal cord and into the brainstem,

1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:06.360
 providing pressure on one nerve pathway

1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:07.900
 can often impact another pathway.

1:35:07.900 --> 1:35:10.480
 And the simplest and most common example of this

1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:12.980
 is one that we all do instinctually or intuitively,

1:35:12.980 --> 1:35:14.760
 even animals do this.

1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:17.240
 This is something that in the textbooks

1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:19.000
 is called the gait theory of pain

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.320
 developed by Melzack and Wall, kind of classic theory.

1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:25.960
 Basically we have receptors in our skin,

1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:27.520
 the so-called C-fibers.

1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:29.920
 That's just a name for these little wires

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:32.120
 that come from a particular class of DRGs

1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:35.800
 that's very thin that brings about certain kinds

1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:37.440
 of nociceptor information.

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:40.360
 I want to say pain information, but then the pain people,

1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:42.200
 believe it or not, they're pain people.

1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.460
 Sometimes they're a pain because what they tell me

1:35:44.460 --> 1:35:46.880
 is there aren't pain receptors, okay, nociceptors.

1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:50.340
 That information comes in through the C-fibers

1:35:50.340 --> 1:35:53.920
 and what happens when we injure something?

1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:57.320
 Well, provided that we won't damage it worse by touching it,

1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:01.400
 oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain

1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:05.440
 or the location in which we were experiencing pain.

1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:10.440
 And it turns out that's not an unuseful thing to do.

1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:14.340
 When we rub our skin or an area

1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:16.500
 or we provide pressure nearby it,

1:36:16.500 --> 1:36:18.320
 we activate the so-called A-fibers,

1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:22.080
 the bigger wires and neurons that innervate,

1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:24.480
 meaning they jut into that area of skin.

1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:26.560
 And those A-fibers,

1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:29.200
 the ones that respond to mechanical pressure,

1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:32.240
 actually are able to inhibit those C-fibers,

1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:35.120
 the ones that are carrying that so-called pain information.

1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:38.460
 So rubbing an area or providing pressure above

1:36:38.460 --> 1:36:40.580
 or below an injury actually provides

1:36:40.580 --> 1:36:45.160
 real pain relief support for the location of that injury

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.520
 or that pain because of the way

1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:49.020
 that these different patterns

1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:51.060
 or these different types of neurons

1:36:51.060 --> 1:36:52.460
 interact with one another.

1:36:52.460 --> 1:36:53.760
 When I say it inhibits it,

1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:55.760
 I don't mean that it like shouts at it.

1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:56.920
 What it does is it releases,

1:36:56.920 --> 1:36:59.560
 it's literally kind of like vomits up

1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:02.240
 a little bit of a neurotransmitter called GABA.

1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:04.920
 And GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits,

1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:08.200
 it quiets the activity of other neurons.

1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:11.860
 And so it's acting as kind of an analgesic, if you will.

1:37:11.860 --> 1:37:14.900
 It's acting as its own form of drug

1:37:14.900 --> 1:37:17.880
 that you make with your body to quiet the activity

1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:19.040
 of these pain neurons.

1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:20.160
 So rubbing a wound,

1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:22.760
 provided it doesn't damage the wound worse,

1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:25.300
 or providing pressure above or below,

1:37:25.300 --> 1:37:28.240
 typically it's above a particular injury,

1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:29.980
 can have a real effect in relieving

1:37:29.980 --> 1:37:31.400
 some of the pain of that injury.

1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:34.020
 And some people have speculated this is through fascia

1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:36.960
 or this is through other bodily organs and tissues.

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:39.320
 And it might be, we're going to do a whole episode on fascia.

1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:41.120
 It's extremely interesting tissue.

1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:43.100
 But right now it seems that the main source

1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:47.400
 of that pain relief is through this A-fiber inhibition

1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:48.760
 of these C-fibers,

1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:51.860
 so-called Melzack and Wahl gate theory of pain,

1:37:51.860 --> 1:37:55.140
 if you'd like to look it up and learn about that further.

1:37:55.140 --> 1:37:58.640
 Now let's talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued

1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:02.600
 and perplexed people for probably thousands of years,

1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:05.160
 and that's redheads.

1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:06.200
 You may have heard before

1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:08.600
 that redheads have a higher pain threshold

1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:10.040
 than other individuals.

1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:11.840
 And indeed that is true.

1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:16.060
 There's now a study that looked at this mechanistically.

1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:20.580
 There's a gene called the MC1R gene.

1:38:20.580 --> 1:38:22.960
 And this MC1R gene encodes

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:25.440
 for a number of different proteins.

1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:27.060
 Some of those proteins, of course,

1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:29.320
 are related to the production of melanin.

1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:31.640
 This is why redheads often, not always,

1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:33.720
 but often are very fair-skinned,

1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:35.820
 sometimes have freckles, not always,

1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:37.480
 and of course have red hair.

1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:40.060
 Some people are really intense gingers,

1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:42.620
 not psychologically or emotionally intense,

1:38:42.620 --> 1:38:43.820
 perhaps that too,

1:38:43.820 --> 1:38:46.100
 but meaning their hair is very, very red.

1:38:46.100 --> 1:38:47.420
 Others, it's a lighter red.

1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:49.460
 So of course there's variation here.

1:38:49.460 --> 1:38:52.460
 But this gene, this MC1R gene,

1:38:52.460 --> 1:38:54.940
 is associated with a pathway

1:38:54.940 --> 1:38:57.580
 that relates to something that I've talked about

1:38:57.580 --> 1:38:58.840
 on this podcast before

1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:01.640
 during the episode on hunger and feeding.

1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:04.260
 And this is POMC.

1:39:04.260 --> 1:39:08.620
 POMC stands for pro-opio-melanocortin.

1:39:08.620 --> 1:39:11.180
 And POMC is cut up.

1:39:11.180 --> 1:39:13.380
 It's cleaved into different hormones,

1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:16.680
 including one that enhances pain perception.

1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:19.340
 This is melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

1:39:19.340 --> 1:39:23.120
 And another one that blocks pain, beta-endorphin.

1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:24.740
 Now, if you listen to the episodes

1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:26.940
 on testosterone and estrogen

1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:29.260
 and the episodes on hunger and feeding,

1:39:29.260 --> 1:39:32.180
 some of these molecules will start to ring a bell.

1:39:32.180 --> 1:39:34.180
 Things like melanostimulating hormone

1:39:34.180 --> 1:39:35.940
 relate to pigmentation in the skin,

1:39:35.940 --> 1:39:38.200
 relate to sexual arousal, et cetera.

1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:40.300
 But it turns out that in redheads,

1:39:41.180 --> 1:39:43.460
 because of the fact that they have this gene,

1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:45.640
 this MC1R gene,

1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:49.020
 the POMC, pro-opio-melanocortin,

1:39:49.020 --> 1:39:51.260
 that's cut into different hormones,

1:39:51.260 --> 1:39:52.900
 melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

1:39:52.900 --> 1:39:56.000
 and another one, beta-endorphin.

1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.380
 Beta-endorphin should cue you to the fact

1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:00.980
 that this is in the pain pathway.

1:40:00.980 --> 1:40:03.620
 The endorphins are endogenously made,

1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:06.500
 meaning made within our body, opioids.

1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:09.880
 They actually make us feel numb

1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.420
 in response to certain kinds of pain.

1:40:11.420 --> 1:40:12.780
 Now, not completely numb,

1:40:12.780 --> 1:40:16.960
 but they numb or reduce our perception of pain

1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:19.420
 because of the ways in which they are released

1:40:19.420 --> 1:40:20.820
 from certain brain centers.

1:40:20.820 --> 1:40:23.300
 We'll talk about those brain centers in a moment.

1:40:23.300 --> 1:40:27.460
 So what's really interesting is that this study showed

1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:31.500
 that the presence of these hormones is in everybody.

1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:33.700
 We all have melanocortin-4,

1:40:33.700 --> 1:40:35.380
 we all have beta-endorphins,

1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:37.580
 we all have POMC, et cetera,

1:40:37.580 --> 1:40:41.740
 but redheads make more of these endogenous endorphins.

1:40:41.740 --> 1:40:42.820
 And that's interesting.

1:40:42.820 --> 1:40:46.180
 It allows them to buffer against the pain response.

1:40:46.180 --> 1:40:47.980
 I have a personal anecdote to share with you

1:40:47.980 --> 1:40:50.900
 about this redhead and heightened levels

1:40:50.900 --> 1:40:52.900
 of pain tolerance phenomenon.

1:40:52.900 --> 1:40:54.600
 Obviously, I'm not a redhead.

1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:55.980
 I don't dye my hair,

1:40:55.980 --> 1:40:59.300
 but my partner for many years was a redhead

1:40:59.300 --> 1:41:00.580
 and still is a redhead.

1:41:00.580 --> 1:41:04.260
 She had bright red hair and had that since childhood.

1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:07.640
 Well, we had the fortunate experience

1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:10.880
 of becoming friends with Wim Hof and family.

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:12.500
 They actually came out to visit us

1:41:12.500 --> 1:41:15.500
 and did a series of seminars in the Bay Area.

1:41:15.500 --> 1:41:18.420
 This was in 2016, as I recall.

1:41:18.420 --> 1:41:22.740
 And my partner, she had never done an ice bath.

1:41:22.740 --> 1:41:25.400
 She had never done any kind of real cold water

1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:27.100
 exposure experience before,

1:41:27.100 --> 1:41:28.680
 but it is one particular gathering,

1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:30.540
 as is often the case when Wim is around,

1:41:30.540 --> 1:41:31.440
 there was an ice bath

1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:32.980
 and a number of people were getting into this thing.

1:41:32.980 --> 1:41:34.900
 This was actually before a dinner event.

1:41:34.900 --> 1:41:36.700
 And I think for most people

1:41:36.700 --> 1:41:38.020
 who have never done an ice bath,

1:41:38.020 --> 1:41:41.860
 getting in for 30 seconds or a minute is tolerable,

1:41:41.860 --> 1:41:43.220
 but it takes some effort,

1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:44.160
 it takes some willpower

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:46.320
 and takes some overcoming that pain barrier

1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:48.620
 because it is a little bit painful, not a lot.

1:41:49.900 --> 1:41:51.980
 Some people can stay in longer, three minutes,

1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:54.740
 five minutes without much discomfort.

1:41:54.740 --> 1:41:57.660
 What was incredible is that without any desire

1:41:57.660 --> 1:41:59.440
 to compete with anybody else,

1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:02.660
 my partner, redhead, got into the ice bath

1:42:02.660 --> 1:42:04.580
 and just like sat there for 10 minutes.

1:42:04.580 --> 1:42:06.260
 In fact, at one point, she just kind of turned to me

1:42:06.260 --> 1:42:10.780
 and said, you know, I don't really feel pain.

1:42:10.780 --> 1:42:12.100
 I'm not really in pain.

1:42:12.100 --> 1:42:13.220
 And Wim loved this.

1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:14.140
 Wim thought it was great.

1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:15.900
 He thought it was like the most terrific thing in the world.

1:42:15.900 --> 1:42:17.180
 And he got back in the ice bath

1:42:17.180 --> 1:42:18.220
 and they became fast friends.

1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:20.820
 And I think they're probably still fast friends.

1:42:20.820 --> 1:42:23.280
 So in any event, that's an N of one,

1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:25.860
 what we call an anecdata example.

1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:28.220
 Anecdata is not really a term that we should use too much

1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:31.380
 because it's N of one anecdotes are just that,

1:42:31.380 --> 1:42:32.740
 they're just anecdotes.

1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:36.860
 But it's been described many times in various clinics

1:42:36.860 --> 1:42:38.860
 that were by anesthesiologists,

1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:41.320
 by observation of coaches, et cetera,

1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:45.140
 that redheads, men and women who are redheads,

1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:47.140
 seem to have this higher pain threshold.

1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:51.060
 And it does seem to be because their body naturally produces

1:42:51.060 --> 1:42:53.940
 ways to counter the pain response.

1:42:53.940 --> 1:42:56.780
 They produce their own endogenous opioids.

1:42:56.780 --> 1:42:59.140
 Now, this of course should not be taken to mean

1:42:59.140 --> 1:43:01.620
 that redheads can tolerate more pain

1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:03.940
 and therefore should be subjected to more pain.

1:43:03.940 --> 1:43:07.780
 All it means is that their threshold for pain on average,

1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:09.700
 not all of them, but on average,

1:43:09.700 --> 1:43:12.980
 is shifted higher than that of other individuals.

1:43:12.980 --> 1:43:15.780
 And it remains to be determined whether or not

1:43:15.780 --> 1:43:18.460
 other light-skinned, light-haired individuals

1:43:18.460 --> 1:43:20.980
 also have a heightened level of pain threshold.

1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:23.420
 And I should mention, because I mentioned the ice bath,

1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:26.160
 that of course pain threshold is something

1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:28.900
 that can be built up and provided you do that safely

1:43:28.900 --> 1:43:31.140
 in ways that aren't damaging your tissues,

1:43:31.140 --> 1:43:33.620
 because of course, pain is a signal that is designed

1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:36.320
 to help you to keep from harming yourself,

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:38.620
 but provided that you can do that in a way that's safe

1:43:38.620 --> 1:43:41.140
 and doesn't damage your tissues,

1:43:41.140 --> 1:43:43.360
 increasing your pain threshold through the use of things

1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:46.000
 like ice baths is something that really can be done.

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.420
 It has a lot to do with these contextual

1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:51.400
 or top-down modulations of the experience.

1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:55.060
 You can tell yourself that this is good for me,

1:43:55.060 --> 1:43:57.400
 or I'm doing this by choice or whatever it is,

1:43:57.400 --> 1:43:58.480
 you could distract yourself.

1:43:58.480 --> 1:43:59.940
 There are a huge number of different ways

1:43:59.940 --> 1:44:01.140
 that one could do that.

1:44:01.140 --> 1:44:04.300
 One of the more interesting ways for which there are

1:44:04.300 --> 1:44:06.020
 actually really good scientific data

1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:08.820
 come from my colleague, Sean Mackey's lab.

1:44:08.820 --> 1:44:12.040
 And that actually looked at how love,

1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:16.000
 and in particular the experience of obsessive love,

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.620
 could actually counter the pain response,

1:44:18.620 --> 1:44:21.380
 not just in redheads, but in everybody.

1:44:21.380 --> 1:44:24.640
 So that study, I'll just briefly describe,

1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:26.620
 it involved having people come into the laboratory

1:44:26.620 --> 1:44:28.740
 and experience any one or a number

1:44:28.740 --> 1:44:30.580
 of different painful stimuli,

1:44:30.580 --> 1:44:33.380
 but they had selectively recruited subjects

1:44:33.380 --> 1:44:35.220
 that were in new relationships

1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.080
 for which there was a high degree of infatuation,

1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:40.660
 so much so that the people couldn't stop thinking about

1:44:40.660 --> 1:44:43.640
 or communicating with that new partner

1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:47.240
 up to 80% of their waking time, which is a lot.

1:44:48.700 --> 1:44:51.580
 That constant obsessing about that partner

1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:54.160
 was correlated with, it wasn't causal necessarily,

1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:57.020
 but was correlated with the ability

1:44:57.020 --> 1:44:59.380
 to sustain higher levels of pain

1:44:59.380 --> 1:45:02.740
 than people who were in more typical

1:45:02.740 --> 1:45:05.820
 non-obsessive forms of love,

1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:07.400
 longstanding relationships

1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:10.460
 where there wasn't long obsessive love rather.

1:45:10.460 --> 1:45:12.060
 And of course, in this study,

1:45:12.060 --> 1:45:13.960
 there were a lot of good control groups.

1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:15.960
 They included a distractor,

1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:18.780
 they included people obsessing about other things,

1:45:18.780 --> 1:45:19.720
 their pet, et cetera.

1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:23.740
 They included other forms of love and attachment,

1:45:23.740 --> 1:45:26.380
 but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking

1:45:26.380 --> 1:45:30.020
 can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response.

1:45:30.020 --> 1:45:32.520
 And that should not be surprising.

1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:34.500
 Certain forms of thinking are associated

1:45:34.500 --> 1:45:36.800
 with the release of particular neuromodulators,

1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:38.500
 in particular dopamine.

1:45:38.500 --> 1:45:42.240
 And dopamine, it may seem is kind of the thing

1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.180
 that underlies everything, but it's not.

1:45:44.180 --> 1:45:46.800
 Dopamine is a molecule that's associated

1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:49.740
 with novelty, expectation, motivation, and reward.

1:45:49.740 --> 1:45:52.220
 We talked about this at the beginning of the episode,

1:45:52.220 --> 1:45:55.300
 that it's really the molecule of expectation

1:45:55.300 --> 1:45:58.440
 and motivation and hope and excitement

1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:02.100
 more than it's associated with the receival of the reward.

1:46:02.100 --> 1:46:05.840
 Well, dopamine is coursing throughout the brain

1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:08.200
 at heightened levels and coursing throughout the body

1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:11.140
 at heightened levels when we fall in love.

1:46:11.140 --> 1:46:13.580
 This probably has some adaptive mechanism

1:46:13.580 --> 1:46:15.940
 that ensured pair bonding between people,

1:46:15.940 --> 1:46:17.900
 or who knows, maybe it ensured

1:46:17.900 --> 1:46:19.260
 not bonding to multiple people.

1:46:19.260 --> 1:46:22.380
 Nobody really knows how dopamine functions

1:46:23.300 --> 1:46:24.800
 in terms of pair bonding,

1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:28.100
 but it is known that when people fall in love,

1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:31.620
 new relationships create very high levels of dopamine.

1:46:31.620 --> 1:46:34.460
 And that's probably the mechanistic basis

1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:37.580
 by which these people were able to buffer the pain response

1:46:37.580 --> 1:46:40.220
 by thinking about their partner,

1:46:40.220 --> 1:46:41.900
 this new relationship that they're in

1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:44.580
 almost obsessively or obsessively.

1:46:44.580 --> 1:46:46.440
 Now that raises a deeper question.

1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:48.700
 We should always be asking, yeah, but how, how?

1:46:48.700 --> 1:46:52.860
 Well, the dopamine system can have powerful effects

1:46:52.860 --> 1:46:54.620
 on the inflammation system.

1:46:54.620 --> 1:46:57.060
 And it doesn't do this through mysterious ways.

1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:00.240
 It does this by interacting through the brainstem

1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:03.260
 and some of the neurons that innervate the spleen

1:47:03.260 --> 1:47:07.300
 and other areas of the body that deploy cells

1:47:07.300 --> 1:47:11.300
 to go combat infection, inflammation, and pain.

1:47:11.300 --> 1:47:14.120
 And the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain,

1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:16.700
 and in this case, this particular study,

1:47:16.700 --> 1:47:18.440
 transform our experience of pain,

1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:21.240
 maybe even into something that's pleasureful,

1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:22.640
 is not mysterious.

1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:25.940
 It's really through the activation of brainstem neurons

1:47:25.940 --> 1:47:28.780
 that communicate with areas of our body

1:47:28.780 --> 1:47:31.540
 that deploy things like immune cells.

1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:34.780
 So for instance, we have neurons in our brainstem

1:47:34.780 --> 1:47:38.380
 that can be modulated by the release of dopamine.

1:47:38.380 --> 1:47:40.260
 And those neurons in the brainstem

1:47:40.260 --> 1:47:42.540
 control the release of immune cells

1:47:42.540 --> 1:47:45.900
 from tissues like the spleen or organs like the spleen.

1:47:45.900 --> 1:47:48.800
 And those immune cells can then go combat infection.

1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:50.460
 We've heard before that when we're happy,

1:47:50.460 --> 1:47:52.820
 we're better able to combat infection,

1:47:52.820 --> 1:47:55.120
 deal with pain, deal with all sorts of things.

1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:57.180
 It essentially makes us more resilient.

1:47:57.180 --> 1:47:59.740
 And that's not because dopamine is some magic molecule.

1:47:59.740 --> 1:48:02.460
 It's because dopamine affects particular circuits

1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:05.540
 and tells in a very neurobiological way,

1:48:05.540 --> 1:48:08.780
 in a biochemical way, tells those cells and circuits

1:48:08.780 --> 1:48:10.140
 that conditions are good.

1:48:10.140 --> 1:48:12.040
 Despite the fact that there's pain in the body,

1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:12.940
 conditions are good.

1:48:12.940 --> 1:48:14.500
 You're in love or conditions are good.

1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:17.540
 You want to be in this experience or conditions are good.

1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:20.060
 This is for a greater cause that you're fighting

1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:22.540
 or suffering for some larger purpose.

1:48:22.540 --> 1:48:24.780
 So all of that has existed largely in the realm of

1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:26.940
 psychology and even motivational literature

1:48:26.940 --> 1:48:28.140
 and this kind of thing.

1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:30.060
 But there's a real mechanistic basis for it.

1:48:30.060 --> 1:48:32.740
 Dopamine is a molecule that can bind to receptor sites

1:48:32.740 --> 1:48:34.020
 on these brain areas.

1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:36.140
 Those brain areas can then modulate the organs

1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:38.620
 and tissues of the body that can allow us

1:48:38.620 --> 1:48:39.980
 to lean into challenge.

1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:41.580
 And those challenges can be infection.

1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:43.100
 It can be physical pain.

1:48:43.100 --> 1:48:47.060
 It can be long bouts of effort that are required of us.

1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:50.220
 And I think many people have described the feeling

1:48:50.220 --> 1:48:53.340
 of being newly in love as a heightened level of energy,

1:48:53.340 --> 1:48:54.640
 a capacity to do anything.

1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:58.340
 I mean, the whole concept of a muse is one in which

1:48:58.340 --> 1:49:02.100
 some individual or some thing either imagined or real

1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:06.640
 enters our life and we can use that as fuel.

1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:08.900
 And that fuel is chemical fuel

1:49:08.900 --> 1:49:10.820
 and that chemical fuel is dopamine.

1:49:10.820 --> 1:49:12.740
 And it really does allow for more resilience

1:49:12.740 --> 1:49:15.740
 and can even transform the experience of pain

1:49:15.740 --> 1:49:17.460
 or what would otherwise be pain

1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:19.440
 into an experience of pleasure.

1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.180
 So along those lines, let's talk about pleasure.

1:49:22.180 --> 1:49:24.860
 With all the cells and tissues and machinery related

1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:28.500
 to pain, you might think that our entire touch system

1:49:28.500 --> 1:49:31.300
 is designed to allow us to detect pain

1:49:31.300 --> 1:49:32.620
 and to avoid tissue damage.

1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:36.380
 And while a good percentage of it is devoted to that,

1:49:36.380 --> 1:49:38.420
 a good percentage of it is also devoted

1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:40.880
 to this thing that we call pleasure.

1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:43.260
 And that should come as no surprise.

1:49:43.260 --> 1:49:46.460
 Pleasure isn't just there for our pleasure.

1:49:46.460 --> 1:49:48.460
 It serves an adaptive role.

1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:50.480
 And that adaptive role relates to the fact

1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:52.860
 that every species has a primary goal,

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:54.820
 which is to make more of itself.

1:49:54.820 --> 1:49:56.900
 Otherwise it would go extinct.

1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:01.580
 That process of making more of itself, sexual reproduction,

1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:04.340
 is closely associated with the sensation

1:50:04.340 --> 1:50:06.060
 and the perception of pleasure.

1:50:06.060 --> 1:50:10.380
 And it's no surprise that not only is the highest density

1:50:10.380 --> 1:50:15.220
 of sensory receptors in and on and around the genitalia,

1:50:15.220 --> 1:50:19.100
 but the process of reproduction evokes sensations

1:50:19.100 --> 1:50:22.460
 and molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure.

1:50:22.460 --> 1:50:24.860
 And the currency of pleasure

1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:27.160
 exists in multiple chemical systems,

1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:29.940
 but the primary ones are the dopamine system,

1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:31.780
 which is the anticipation of pleasure

1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:37.700
 and the work required to achieve the ability

1:50:37.700 --> 1:50:39.520
 to experience that pleasure

1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:41.580
 and the serotonin system,

1:50:41.580 --> 1:50:43.080
 which is more closely related

1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:45.540
 to the immediate experience of that pleasure.

1:50:45.540 --> 1:50:47.580
 And from dopamine and serotonin,

1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:50.900
 stem out other hormones and molecules,

1:50:50.900 --> 1:50:52.180
 things like oxytocin,

1:50:52.180 --> 1:50:53.820
 which are associated with pair bonding.

1:50:53.820 --> 1:50:55.980
 Oxytocin is more closely associated

1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:57.580
 with the serotonin system,

1:50:57.580 --> 1:51:00.180
 biochemically and at the circuit level,

1:51:00.180 --> 1:51:01.880
 meaning the areas of the brain and body

1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:04.120
 that manufacture a lot of serotonin,

1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.280
 usually, not always, but usually contain neurons

1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:07.900
 that also manufacture

1:51:07.900 --> 1:51:10.400
 and make use of the molecule oxytocin.

1:51:11.460 --> 1:51:15.460
 Those chemicals together create sensations of warmth,

1:51:15.460 --> 1:51:18.540
 of wellbeing, of safety.

1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:21.780
 The dopamine molecule is more closely associated

1:51:21.780 --> 1:51:24.200
 with hormones like testosterone

1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:26.960
 and other molecules involved with pursuit

1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:30.500
 and further effort in order to get more of whatever

1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:33.340
 could potentially cause more release of dopamine.

1:51:33.340 --> 1:51:36.820
 So this is a very broad strokes, no pun intended,

1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:39.680
 description of the pleasure system.

1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:41.680
 There are of course other molecules as well.

1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:44.400
 One in particular that's very interesting

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:46.600
 is something called PEA.

1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:49.900
 PEA stands for phenylethylamine,

1:51:49.900 --> 1:51:53.020
 sometimes also referred to as phenylethylamine,

1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:56.120
 depending on who you are and where you live.

1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:59.020
 How you pronounce it doesn't really matter.

1:51:59.020 --> 1:52:03.760
 PEA is a molecule which is incredibly potent

1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:06.980
 at augmenting or increasing the activity

1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:09.060
 of certain cells and neural circuits

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:11.540
 that relate to the pleasure system.

1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:16.140
 PEA has purportedly been thought to be released

1:52:16.140 --> 1:52:17.740
 in response to ingestion of things

1:52:17.740 --> 1:52:19.780
 like certain forms of dark chocolate.

1:52:19.780 --> 1:52:21.760
 Some people take it in supplement form.

1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:24.020
 It's a bit of a stimulant,

1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:27.540
 but it also seems to heighten the perception of pleasure

1:52:27.540 --> 1:52:29.460
 in response to a particular amount

1:52:29.460 --> 1:52:31.440
 of dopamine and or serotonin.

1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:34.460
 So for instance, in a kind of a arbitrary experiment

1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:36.180
 and units type example,

1:52:36.180 --> 1:52:39.700
 if a given experience evokes a particular amount

1:52:39.700 --> 1:52:42.220
 of serotonin and dopamine and gives rise

1:52:42.220 --> 1:52:44.100
 to a subjective experience of pleasure

1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:46.200
 of say level three out of 10,

1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:48.700
 the ingestion of PEA prior to that experience

1:52:48.700 --> 1:52:51.860
 can increase the rating of that experience

1:52:51.860 --> 1:52:55.620
 as more pleasureful, maybe a four or a five or even a six.

1:52:55.620 --> 1:52:59.460
 And PEA is known to be present in,

1:52:59.460 --> 1:53:02.000
 or I should say its release is stimulated

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:06.100
 by a number of different compounds, such as dark chocolate,

1:53:06.100 --> 1:53:08.780
 certain things like aspartame and certain people

1:53:08.780 --> 1:53:11.540
 can actually increase the amount of PEA released.

1:53:11.540 --> 1:53:15.340
 Some of these glutamate related molecules like aspartame

1:53:15.340 --> 1:53:17.080
 or things that are in the glutamate pathway

1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:18.700
 can increase PEA release.

1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:20.820
 And then some people will actually take PEA

1:53:20.820 --> 1:53:25.300
 in supplement form for its mild stimulant properties

1:53:25.300 --> 1:53:28.980
 as well as for increasing the perception of

1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:31.540
 or the ability to experience pleasure.

1:53:31.540 --> 1:53:32.900
 It's not a sledgehammer.

1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:35.940
 It's not a like dopamine itself.

1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:38.140
 People that take things like macuna purines,

1:53:38.140 --> 1:53:40.460
 L-DOPA or drugs of abuse,

1:53:40.460 --> 1:53:41.780
 which I certainly don't recommend,

1:53:41.780 --> 1:53:44.720
 things like cocaine or amphetamine

1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:47.900
 experience tremendous increases in dopamine,

1:53:47.900 --> 1:53:50.520
 not so much increases in serotonin.

1:53:51.860 --> 1:53:55.180
 Some people will take serotonin in precursor form

1:53:55.180 --> 1:53:57.540
 like 5-HTP or serotonin itself,

1:53:57.540 --> 1:54:00.380
 or they'll take the amino acid precursor like tryptophan.

1:54:00.380 --> 1:54:02.380
 I'm not saying these things as recommendations

1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:04.460
 for increasingly one sense of pleasure.

1:54:04.460 --> 1:54:07.300
 I'm describing them because of what they do

1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:09.980
 generally falls into two categories.

1:54:09.980 --> 1:54:13.700
 The first category is to raise the foundation,

1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:17.340
 what we call the tonic level of dopamine and serotonin.

1:54:17.340 --> 1:54:22.340
 So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low,

1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:27.460
 it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure.

1:54:27.460 --> 1:54:29.780
 There's a so-called ahedonia.

1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:31.820
 This is also described as depression,

1:54:31.820 --> 1:54:34.660
 although it needn't be long-term depression.

1:54:34.660 --> 1:54:37.460
 So certain drugs like antidepressants,

1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:42.180
 like Wellbutrin, Bupriarone as it's commonly called,

1:54:42.180 --> 1:54:44.300
 or the so-called SSRIs,

1:54:44.300 --> 1:54:47.980
 the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, excuse me,

1:54:47.980 --> 1:54:50.000
 like Prozac, Zoloft and similar

1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:53.260
 will increase dopamine and serotonin respectively.

1:54:53.260 --> 1:54:56.920
 They're not increasing the peaks in those molecules.

1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:00.140
 The, what we call the acute release of those molecules,

1:55:00.140 --> 1:55:01.300
 what they're doing is they're raising

1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.460
 the overall levels of those molecules.

1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:06.500
 They're raising the sort of foundation or the tide,

1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:08.740
 if you will, think about it as your mood

1:55:08.740 --> 1:55:11.020
 or your pleasure rather is like a boat.

1:55:11.020 --> 1:55:13.760
 And if it's on the shore and it can't get out to sea

1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:15.140
 unless that tide is high enough,

1:55:15.140 --> 1:55:17.440
 that's kind of the way to think about these tonic levels

1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:19.020
 of dopamine and serotonin.

1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:22.500
 Now, most of us fortunately do not have problems

1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:25.140
 with our baseline or our tonic levels

1:55:25.140 --> 1:55:27.360
 of dopamine and serotonin release.

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.240
 Things like PEA in that case

1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:31.860
 will cause a slight increase in that tide

1:55:31.860 --> 1:55:36.560
 and make the ability of certain experiences

1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.220
 to increase dopamine further more available.

1:55:40.220 --> 1:55:44.100
 What we call this in neuroscience is so-called gain control.

1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:46.100
 It can kind of turn up the volume,

1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:47.960
 bring us closer to the threshold

1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:49.560
 to activate certain circuits.

1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:51.140
 And this is really what we mean

1:55:51.140 --> 1:55:54.360
 when we say a neuromodulator, okay?

1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:57.820
 This is why when you are very happy about something,

1:55:57.820 --> 1:55:59.300
 let's say you're out with your friends,

1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:00.980
 you're really excited, you know,

1:56:00.980 --> 1:56:02.620
 maybe depending on where you live

1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.500
 and what's going on in your area of the world right now,

1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:06.340
 like, you know, like I have a niece

1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:07.920
 and she's been locked up in quarantine

1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:10.220
 for a long time recently because it was deemed safe.

1:56:10.220 --> 1:56:11.580
 She got to go to summer camp.

1:56:11.580 --> 1:56:14.940
 I have never seen that kid so happy to spend,

1:56:14.940 --> 1:56:16.900
 excuse me, spend time with her friends.

1:56:17.900 --> 1:56:20.540
 She was so excited and it was really amazing

1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:21.660
 to see how excited she was.

1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:24.700
 Her baseline levels of dopamine were clearly up,

1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:28.200
 so much so that when she saw her friends,

1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:30.540
 she literally started squealing, okay?

1:56:30.540 --> 1:56:31.940
 They were squealing, she was squealing.

1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:32.780
 Everyone was squealing.

1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:33.760
 I wasn't squealing.

1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:35.180
 I would admit it if I was squealing.

1:56:35.180 --> 1:56:37.780
 I wasn't squealing, but it was such a delight to see

1:56:37.780 --> 1:56:39.860
 and I'm sure that made my dopamine levels go up,

1:56:39.860 --> 1:56:41.720
 which was she was just so excited,

1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:43.560
 such that anything and everything

1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:45.020
 felt like an exciting stimulus.

1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:46.820
 This is pleasure, right?

1:56:46.820 --> 1:56:48.620
 And I don't want to write off the experience

1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:51.620
 from a neurobiological reductionist standpoint

1:56:51.620 --> 1:56:52.460
 quite the opposite.

1:56:52.460 --> 1:56:54.420
 It's really beautiful to see, again,

1:56:54.420 --> 1:56:57.840
 this principle that different experiences

1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:01.060
 and the experience of pleasure from different things,

1:57:01.060 --> 1:57:02.460
 seeing your friends for the first time,

1:57:02.460 --> 1:57:06.220
 summer camp for a kid, whatever it might happen to be,

1:57:06.220 --> 1:57:08.820
 use the same currency, dopamine,

1:57:08.820 --> 1:57:11.420
 use the same currency, serotonin.

1:57:11.420 --> 1:57:13.060
 And this is a principle that I hope

1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:14.400
 in listening to this podcast

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:16.180
 and even some of its repetitive features

1:57:16.180 --> 1:57:17.860
 from one episode to the next,

1:57:18.700 --> 1:57:20.820
 I'm hoping that those will start to embed in your mind

1:57:20.820 --> 1:57:24.100
 that the brain and body use these common currencies

1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:25.540
 for different experiences.

1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:27.740
 So yes, if your dopamine and serotonin,

1:57:27.740 --> 1:57:29.700
 or I should say if your dopamine

1:57:29.700 --> 1:57:32.780
 and or serotonin levels are too low,

1:57:32.780 --> 1:57:34.820
 it will be very hard to achieve pleasure,

1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:36.440
 to experience physical pleasure

1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:38.660
 or emotional pleasure of any kind.

1:57:38.660 --> 1:57:40.700
 That's why treatments of the sort

1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:43.740
 that I described a minute ago might be right for you.

1:57:43.740 --> 1:57:45.500
 Obviously we can't determine if they're right for you.

1:57:45.500 --> 1:57:47.120
 It's also why they have side effects.

1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:49.900
 If you artificially increase these molecules

1:57:49.900 --> 1:57:51.620
 that are associated with pleasure,

1:57:51.620 --> 1:57:53.940
 oftentimes you get a lack of motivation

1:57:53.940 --> 1:57:55.360
 to go seek things like food.

1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:57.160
 People don't get much interest in food

1:57:57.160 --> 1:57:58.100
 because why should they

1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:00.260
 if their serotonin levels are already up?

1:58:00.260 --> 1:58:02.820
 Again, there's a ton of individual variation.

1:58:02.820 --> 1:58:05.100
 I don't want to say that these antidepressants

1:58:05.100 --> 1:58:06.340
 are always bad.

1:58:06.340 --> 1:58:08.300
 Sometimes they've saved lives.

1:58:08.300 --> 1:58:09.640
 They've saved millions of lives.

1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:10.920
 Sometimes people have side effects

1:58:10.920 --> 1:58:12.520
 that make them not the right choice.

1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:14.860
 So it has to be determined for the individual.

1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:18.660
 Things like PEA are a more subtle effect.

1:58:18.660 --> 1:58:21.140
 I should mention PEA supplementation

1:58:21.140 --> 1:58:23.180
 is something that a number of people use,

1:58:23.180 --> 1:58:24.580
 but it's very short-lived.

1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:27.760
 Because of the half-life of this molecule is very brief,

1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:30.560
 the effect only lasts about 20 minutes or so.

1:58:31.700 --> 1:58:34.360
 Things like L-DOPA and the cunipurines

1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:38.820
 lead to longer baseline increases in dopamine.

1:58:38.820 --> 1:58:42.100
 But remember, anytime you raise a baseline,

1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:46.180
 you reduce the so-called signal to noise.

1:58:46.180 --> 1:58:48.080
 What it means is if you're riding around

1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:49.460
 at really high dopamine,

1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:51.780
 at first, everything will start to seem exciting,

1:58:51.780 --> 1:58:53.740
 like my niece and seeing her friends for the first time.

1:58:53.740 --> 1:58:55.220
 Everything's exciting.

1:58:55.220 --> 1:58:56.420
 But then what will happen is

1:58:56.420 --> 1:58:59.620
 when your dopamine levels return to more normal levels,

1:58:59.620 --> 1:59:02.780
 it will take a much greater dopamine increase,

1:59:02.780 --> 1:59:06.020
 a much bigger event, more novel, more exciting,

1:59:06.020 --> 1:59:08.540
 in order to achieve the sense

1:59:08.540 --> 1:59:11.380
 that what you're experiencing is pleasureful.

1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:13.380
 And this is because of the relationship

1:59:13.380 --> 1:59:15.420
 between pleasure and pain.

1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:16.560
 Now, in a future episode,

1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:18.540
 we are going to go deep into this relationship

1:59:18.540 --> 1:59:20.340
 between pleasure and pain.

1:59:20.340 --> 1:59:23.240
 But just briefly, as a precursor to that,

1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:24.380
 and because it's relevant

1:59:24.380 --> 1:59:26.580
 to the conversation that we've been having,

1:59:28.140 --> 1:59:31.700
 you might want to be wary of any experience,

1:59:31.700 --> 1:59:34.720
 any experience, no matter how it arrives,

1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:38.480
 chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination.

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:39.860
 You might want to be wary

1:59:39.860 --> 1:59:42.060
 of letting your dopamine go too high,

1:59:42.060 --> 1:59:44.220
 and certainly you want to be wary of it going too low

1:59:44.220 --> 1:59:46.540
 because of the way that these circuits adjust.

1:59:46.540 --> 1:59:48.940
 Basically, every time that the pleasure system

1:59:48.940 --> 1:59:51.820
 is kicked in in high gear,

1:59:51.820 --> 1:59:54.180
 an absolutely spectacular event,

1:59:54.180 --> 1:59:56.860
 you cannot be more ecstatic.

1:59:56.860 --> 2:00:01.860
 There is a mirror symmetric activation of the pain system.

2:00:02.100 --> 2:00:05.740
 And this might seem like an evil curse of biology,

2:00:05.740 --> 2:00:06.580
 but it's not.

2:00:06.580 --> 2:00:09.760
 This is actually a way to protect this whole system

2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:11.260
 of reward and motivation

2:00:11.260 --> 2:00:14.140
 that I talked about at the beginning of the episode.

2:00:14.140 --> 2:00:16.380
 It might sound great to just ingest substances

2:00:16.380 --> 2:00:18.340
 or engage in behaviors where it's just dopamine,

2:00:18.340 --> 2:00:21.440
 dopamine, dopamine, and just constantly be motivated,

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:23.980
 but the system will eventually crash.

2:00:23.980 --> 2:00:24.820
 And so what happens

2:00:24.820 --> 2:00:26.900
 is when you have a big increase in dopamine,

2:00:26.900 --> 2:00:29.940
 you also will get a big increase in the circuits

2:00:29.940 --> 2:00:32.940
 that underlie our sense of disappointment

2:00:32.940 --> 2:00:34.940
 and readjusting the balance.

2:00:34.940 --> 2:00:38.020
 And with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine,

2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:40.720
 not naturally occurring, wonderful events,

2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:45.720
 but really high chemically induced peaks in dopamine,

2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:49.240
 high magnitude chemically induced peaks in dopamine,

2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:51.280
 what happens is those peaks in dopamine

2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:53.600
 start to go down and down and down

2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:55.280
 in response to the same

2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:57.800
 what ought to be incredible experience.

2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:01.380
 We start to what's called habituate or attenuate,

2:01:01.380 --> 2:01:05.800
 and yet the pain increases in size.

2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:08.340
 And this has a preservative function

2:01:08.340 --> 2:01:11.000
 in keeping us safe, believe it or not.

2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.340
 But what I just described is actually the basis

2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:16.120
 of most, if not all forms of addiction,

2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:17.360
 something that we will deal with

2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:19.360
 in a future episode in depth.

2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:20.800
 So what should you think about all this?

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.920
 How should you think about pleasure

2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:23.360
 and how should you think about pain?

2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:25.240
 What is too much pleasure?

2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:28.840
 Well, that's going to differ from person to person,

2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:33.360
 but to the extent that one can access pleasure repeatedly

2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:37.640
 over time, ideally without chemical augmentation,

2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:40.020
 certainly not excessive chemical augmentation,

2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:42.660
 that means that this pleasure system is tuned up well

2:01:42.660 --> 2:01:44.440
 and can continue to experience pleasure.

2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:47.560
 However, if you find yourself engaging

2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:50.080
 in the same behavior over and over again,

2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:52.880
 but achieving less and less pleasure from it,

2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:56.320
 chances are you want to adjust down

2:01:56.320 --> 2:01:58.840
 how often you engage in that behavior

2:02:00.200 --> 2:02:04.400
 and or adjust down your expectation of reward

2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:06.580
 every time you engage in that behavior.

2:02:07.900 --> 2:02:08.920
 What do I mean by that?

2:02:08.920 --> 2:02:10.320
 Well, at the beginning of the episode,

2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:13.760
 I talked about how dopamine will allow us

2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:15.780
 to get into bouts of hard work.

2:02:15.780 --> 2:02:19.000
 We will work very hard to pursue a reward

2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:20.400
 and that's really what dopamine does.

2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:21.820
 And then when the reward comes,

2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:24.040
 that doesn't increase our dopamine.

2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:26.200
 In fact, our dopamine levels go down.

2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:30.560
 One of the key things that we can all do

2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:34.280
 to adjust our ability to experience pleasure

2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:38.840
 is to engage in that intermittent reward schedule.

2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:41.580
 You can either adjust down the peak in dopamine,

2:02:41.580 --> 2:02:43.440
 meaning not let yourself ever get too happy,

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:44.560
 but that's no fun, right?

2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:49.560
 Life is about occasionally achieving or experiencing ecstasy

2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:52.840
 but every once in a while, remove the reward.

2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:54.280
 And of course I don't mean ecstasy the drug,

2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:55.160
 that's a separate matter.

2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:57.600
 The MDMA trials are a separate matter, very interesting.

2:02:57.600 --> 2:02:59.660
 I want to be clear, I meant psychological

2:02:59.660 --> 2:03:03.200
 and physical ecstasy of the natural sort.

2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:06.920
 I've immense interest in what's going on in the MDMA trials

2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:09.360
 but just for clarity purposes,

2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:11.440
 that's a separate topic that we will cover

2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:14.360
 in an episode, excuse me, very soon.

2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:17.240
 So how do you adjust this dopamine system?

2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:20.020
 Well, every once in a while at random,

2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:25.000
 not in a predictable way, you remove the reward

2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.240
 and that will keep you and your dopamine system tuned up

2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:30.080
 in the proper ways.

2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:32.600
 The gain of the dopamine system, as we say,

2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:34.900
 will be adjusted so that you can continue

2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:37.240
 to experience dopamine and serotonin

2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:38.840
 when you actually get the reward.

2:03:40.380 --> 2:03:42.880
 This can be translated into a huge number

2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:45.240
 of different domains, but I want to give some examples

2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:47.280
 because I'm sure that many of you are asking,

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:48.460
 wait, what does this actually mean?

2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:50.200
 Okay, let's say you're a student

2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:52.840
 or this could be a student in academia

2:03:52.840 --> 2:03:56.180
 or this could be a student of a physical practice.

2:03:56.180 --> 2:03:59.080
 Every once in a while, when you do something really well,

2:04:00.220 --> 2:04:02.540
 maybe that's even just showing up to the practice.

2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:05.040
 Rather than pat yourself on the back,

2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:06.240
 just tell yourself, yeah,

2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:08.120
 that's the minimum that's expected of me.

2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:10.580
 When everyone's excited about something that you're doing,

2:04:10.580 --> 2:04:12.080
 maybe you're excited about it,

2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:14.800
 try and adjust down your excitement a little bit.

2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:16.880
 I know this might seem counterintuitive,

2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:18.920
 but you're preserving the ability

2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:21.940
 to experience excitement in a variety of contexts.

2:04:21.940 --> 2:04:25.500
 Let's say you get a big monetary award.

2:04:25.500 --> 2:04:30.300
 Well, that's great, I'm happy for you and that's wonderful.

2:04:30.300 --> 2:04:33.120
 However, you should be a little bit wary

2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:34.760
 if you care about your dopamine system

2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:35.880
 and you care about your ability

2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:39.120
 to get subsequent monetary rewards,

2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:41.680
 excuse me, awards, rewards, doesn't matter which,

2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:42.540
 through effort.

2:04:42.540 --> 2:04:44.540
 If you want to be able to maintain the ability

2:04:44.540 --> 2:04:47.320
 to exert effort, well, then you probably wouldn't want

2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:49.440
 to run out and immediately buy something

2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:51.160
 with that monetary reward.

2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:52.600
 In other words, you wouldn't want to layer on

2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:55.520
 more dopamine release, okay?

2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:59.440
 You might, but you might not, you might skip it.

2:04:59.440 --> 2:05:01.500
 What you'll find then is that your motivation

2:05:01.500 --> 2:05:03.060
 is essentially infinite.

2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:05.480
 This is what I described at the beginning of the episode.

2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:08.660
 And again, it's because dopamine is this currency.

2:05:08.660 --> 2:05:11.200
 It's like, these days you hear a lot about Bitcoin

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:15.120
 and Ethereum and Dogecoin and US dollars and euros

2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:16.700
 and all this other stuff.

2:05:16.700 --> 2:05:20.740
 But the currency that you use in your body

2:05:20.740 --> 2:05:23.140
 doesn't matter what external currency those are.

2:05:23.140 --> 2:05:25.740
 In fact, as you watch the value of different currencies

2:05:25.740 --> 2:05:27.300
 go up, whether or not it's cryptocurrency

2:05:27.300 --> 2:05:30.880
 or standard currency, the value is actually reflective

2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:33.800
 of the dopamine that exists inside of people, right?

2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:36.400
 So all the excitement about a particular currency,

2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:39.620
 crypto or otherwise, is really just dopamine.

2:05:39.620 --> 2:05:42.880
 That's the currency that we all use.

2:05:42.880 --> 2:05:44.680
 And there's no negotiating that.

2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:46.760
 That's just the way that we're built.

2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:48.800
 Now, to give yet other examples,

2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:51.100
 let's say you're teaching other people how to do something

2:05:51.100 --> 2:05:53.320
 and they do something exceptionally well.

2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:55.760
 If you reward them every single time,

2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:58.000
 and in particular, if you reward them with something

2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.920
 that's even greater than the experience of what they did.

2:06:00.920 --> 2:06:04.100
 So let's say kids win a soccer game and they're ecstatic,

2:06:04.100 --> 2:06:06.440
 they're jumping all over the place, they're super excited,

2:06:06.440 --> 2:06:09.600
 and you reward them with an even bigger experience,

2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:14.520
 a celebration, you are actually inhibiting their ability

2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:17.640
 to perform the same set of activities

2:06:17.640 --> 2:06:19.080
 that led them to the win.

2:06:19.080 --> 2:06:21.040
 If, and I really want to underscore,

2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:22.920
 if you reward them every time.

2:06:22.920 --> 2:06:26.240
 Of course, we should reward kids and each other

2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:28.400
 and ourselves for our accomplishments,

2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:30.800
 but you don't want to do it every time.

2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:33.000
 And sure, there will be some disappointment

2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:37.840
 from suddenly removing the reward that you expected,

2:06:37.840 --> 2:06:39.180
 but that's exactly the point.

2:06:39.180 --> 2:06:41.820
 That's what keeps these circuits tuned up properly.

2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:43.300
 Now there's the other form of pleasure,

2:06:43.300 --> 2:06:47.040
 which is the more immediate visceral

2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:49.200
 or sensory experience of pleasure.

2:06:49.200 --> 2:06:51.720
 This is distinct from goals and goal-directed behavior.

2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:53.320
 I'm talking about the immediate experience.

2:06:53.320 --> 2:06:55.800
 This is more of the serotonergic system.

2:06:55.800 --> 2:06:57.560
 There are other systems involved too,

2:06:57.560 --> 2:07:00.840
 but this is also the system that draws out

2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:04.120
 those endogenous opioids from a particular structure.

2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:06.500
 We have a structure in the back of our brain called PAG,

2:07:06.500 --> 2:07:10.000
 P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area.

2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:13.280
 Very interesting brain area that is associated with pain,

2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:16.460
 but also with pleasure because under certain conditions,

2:07:16.460 --> 2:07:19.340
 it deploys endogenous opioids

2:07:19.340 --> 2:07:22.260
 and gives us a kind of blissed out feeling, okay?

2:07:22.260 --> 2:07:25.600
 This is not like the opioids of the opioid epidemic sort

2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:28.000
 that people take and unfortunately have led

2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.440
 to tremendous amounts of suffering and abuse.

2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:32.960
 These are endogenously released opioids.

2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:34.400
 These are the kind of opioids that come out

2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:38.060
 from long distance bouts of physical exercise and running.

2:07:38.060 --> 2:07:40.140
 These are the opioids that are deployed

2:07:40.140 --> 2:07:42.260
 in response to giving birth

2:07:42.260 --> 2:07:45.800
 and overcoming the tremendous pain of childbirth.

2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:48.360
 So PAG is very contextual

2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:51.200
 and there are a few types of stimuli,

2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:53.800
 or I should say events in life.

2:07:53.800 --> 2:07:55.280
 I'm really showing my nerdy side.

2:07:55.280 --> 2:07:56.760
 There are a few types of stimuli,

2:07:56.760 --> 2:07:58.240
 I'm talking about experiences

2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:02.280
 that evoke endogenous opioid release from PAG.

2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:05.000
 One is sexual activity.

2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:08.380
 Sexual activity can increase pain threshold.

2:08:08.380 --> 2:08:12.800
 And here I am not suggesting or getting involved

2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:15.520
 in anyone's particular proclivities or personal experiences.

2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:18.040
 You're welcome to editorialize this however you like.

2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:21.180
 However, what I'm talking about are animal data

2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:23.180
 and yes, human data as well

2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:25.280
 that show that pain thresholds are increased

2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:27.520
 anytime PAG is activated

2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:30.160
 because of the release of these endogenous opioids.

2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:35.040
 There's also the immediate experience

2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:37.240
 of whether or not a particular form of touch

2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:38.800
 is pleasureful or not.

2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:40.740
 And there there's some very interesting biology

2:08:40.740 --> 2:08:43.440
 that relates to really how those little wires

2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:45.520
 from those DRGs innervate our skin.

2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:48.600
 Work studies, I should say,

2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:51.520
 done by David Ginty's lab at Harvard Medical School.

2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:53.740
 The Ginty lab has spent years

2:08:53.740 --> 2:08:56.880
 working on the somatosensory system, the touch system,

2:08:56.880 --> 2:09:00.380
 has identified a particular category of neurons

2:09:00.380 --> 2:09:01.440
 that innervate the skin.

2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:02.480
 And then those neurons, of course,

2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:04.600
 send that information up to the brain too.

2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:08.420
 And they actually respond to direction of touch.

2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:10.680
 Now, some of you might be more sensitive to this

2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:14.880
 than others, but it turns out that certain hairs

2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:17.820
 like to be deflected one way versus another.

2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:20.620
 Whether or not you like cats or not,

2:09:20.620 --> 2:09:22.000
 you can do this experiment.

2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.120
 You can pet a cat in the direction that their fur lies.

2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:26.760
 So it lies down in a particular direction.

2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:28.040
 You'll notice that there's actually a gene

2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:29.620
 that dictates that the hairs lie down

2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:30.800
 in a particular direction.

2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:33.800
 And if you pet them in a way that's

2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:38.100
 cooperating with that direction,

2:09:38.100 --> 2:09:39.340
 so not pushing the hairs up,

2:09:39.340 --> 2:09:42.540
 but rather stroking the hairs on the back of the cat,

2:09:42.540 --> 2:09:44.060
 what you'll notice is they often like that.

2:09:44.060 --> 2:09:45.880
 Not all cats, some cats are pretty grouchy,

2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:49.560
 but if you stroke their hair, they will often purr,

2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:51.260
 they'll often push into you.

2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:53.800
 If you were to stroke their hair in the opposite direction,

2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:56.160
 pushing the hairs up against the direction

2:09:56.160 --> 2:09:59.320
 that they want to lie down, cats do not like that.

2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:01.120
 And it turns out people don't like that either.

2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:03.040
 Some people do like to have their hair pushed

2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:05.220
 in a direction against the direction

2:10:05.220 --> 2:10:07.000
 in which it wants to lay down,

2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.760
 but there is more typically a response

2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:12.480
 of feeling like it's pleasurable for,

2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:14.820
 for instance, when someone brushes or combs their hair

2:10:14.820 --> 2:10:16.400
 in the direction that it wants to lay down.

2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:19.160
 And that's because the way in which these neurons

2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:22.000
 that innervate these hairs sends information

2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:23.800
 up to the brain, bifurcates actually,

2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:27.040
 it splits into brain centers that evoke a sense of pleasure

2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:28.520
 or a sense of not pleasure.

2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:30.100
 It's not necessarily pain.

2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:34.000
 So you might find that certain people are very particular.

2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.200
 They like to be touched in a certain way, but not others.

2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:37.840
 You might be one of those people.

2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:41.620
 And areas of our skin that have high density of receptors

2:10:41.620 --> 2:10:45.720
 are very, very sensitive in a real way,

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:49.600
 in a real sense of the word, to patterns of touch

2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:53.680
 and whether or not a touch is too firm or too light.

2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:58.560
 And that will be modulated by overall levels of arousal.

2:10:58.560 --> 2:10:59.760
 And when I talk about arousal,

2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:02.460
 what I'm talking about is how alert or how sleepy we are.

2:11:02.460 --> 2:11:05.280
 It is impossible to experience pain

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:07.620
 when we are deep in sleep.

2:11:07.620 --> 2:11:09.600
 I don't mean sleeping like of the typical night sword.

2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:10.800
 I mean of the anesthesia sword.

2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:12.320
 That's the purpose of anesthesia,

2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:15.220
 to bring the brain and body into a deep plane of rest,

2:11:15.220 --> 2:11:16.760
 very deep, in fact.

2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:20.220
 And it's very hard, if not impossible,

2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:22.640
 to achieve or experience pleasure

2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:26.320
 when we are in a very low state of arousal as well.

2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:29.080
 When we are in heightened states of arousal,

2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:32.120
 we can achieve pain, we can experience pain,

2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:35.040
 and we can experience pleasure, okay?

2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:37.520
 And under those heightened states of arousal,

2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:41.080
 we are more sensitive, literally,

2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:43.080
 the passage of electrical signals

2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:45.200
 from those locations on the body

2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:48.000
 that have heightened degrees or higher degrees,

2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:51.160
 I should say, of receptors, use your imagination.

2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:53.560
 They include the lips, the face, the feet, and the genitals,

2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:56.740
 and nearby areas, literally nearby areas.

2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:01.620
 Under conditions of high arousal, two things happen.

2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:04.040
 The ability to achieve or experience pleasure

2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:05.920
 at those locations goes up,

2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:09.400
 and our tolerance and our threshold for pain also goes up.

2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:12.720
 So the principle here is that as our levels of arousal,

2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:15.480
 that foundation of arousal goes up or down,

2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:18.360
 so too goes up and down our ability

2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:20.360
 to achieve pleasure and pain.

2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:22.840
 And so these two extremes of being deep within anesthesia,

2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:26.380
 or another extreme is asleep,

2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:28.720
 or in heightened levels of arousal,

2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:30.420
 our ability to achieve pleasure and pain

2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:32.560
 are going to scale according to those.

2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:35.220
 And this is why, and I'm certainly not suggesting this,

2:12:35.220 --> 2:12:38.840
 but this is why some people will take stimulants

2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:41.020
 or drugs of abuse that increase arousal

2:12:41.020 --> 2:12:44.200
 in order to achieve pleasure of other kinds.

2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:46.160
 The problem is is that those drugs,

2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:48.540
 in particular things like cocaine and methamphetamine

2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:51.920
 and amphetamine, become their own form of reinforcement,

2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:56.100
 so much so that the person doesn't seek out

2:12:56.100 --> 2:12:59.840
 any other form of excitement or arousal, okay?

2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:02.800
 So today we weren't talking about addiction.

2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:04.960
 We weren't necessarily talking about motivation,

2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:06.240
 but we touched on those topics

2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:08.880
 as sort of a precursor of what's to come.

2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:11.720
 We talked about the pathways in the skin and in the brain

2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:13.200
 and elsewhere in the body

2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:14.980
 that control our sense of pleasure and pain.

2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:16.840
 We described a number of different tools

2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:19.080
 ranging from hypnosis to different supplements

2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:23.340
 to electroacupuncture and various other tools

2:13:23.340 --> 2:13:24.560
 that one could use to modulate

2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:26.700
 your sense of pleasure or pain.

2:13:26.700 --> 2:13:28.900
 And of course, in thinking about pleasure,

2:13:28.900 --> 2:13:30.360
 we have to think about the dopamine system

2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:31.400
 and the serotonin system

2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:33.520
 and some of the related chemical systems.

2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:35.020
 I realized that today's podcast

2:13:35.020 --> 2:13:37.540
 had a lot of scientific details.

2:13:37.540 --> 2:13:38.960
 We've timestamped everything for you

2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.300
 so that you don't have to digest it all at once, of course.

2:13:42.300 --> 2:13:44.820
 I don't expect that everyone would be able to understand

2:13:44.820 --> 2:13:46.680
 all these details all at once.

2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:48.760
 What's more important really

2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:51.080
 is to understand the general principles

2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:53.640
 of how something like pleasure and pain work,

2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:56.340
 how they interact and the various cells and systems

2:13:56.340 --> 2:13:58.760
 within the brain and body that allow them to occur

2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:02.440
 and that modulate or change their ability to occur.

2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:04.400
 And of course, your subjective experience

2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:05.680
 of pleasure or pain.

2:14:05.680 --> 2:14:08.280
 So I do hope that this was on whole

2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:10.560
 more pleasureful than painful for you.

2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:11.880

 and leave us feedback.

2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:40.160
 There are other ways to support the podcast as well.

2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:43.840
 We have a Patreon, that's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:45.680
 And there you can support the podcast

2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:47.560
 at any level that you like.

2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:49.420
 In addition, please check out our sponsors

2:14:49.420 --> 2:14:51.760
 that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:53.700
 We only work with sponsors and brands

2:14:53.700 --> 2:14:55.960
 that we absolutely love their products

2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:57.560
 and that we wholeheartedly endorse

2:14:57.560 --> 2:14:59.040
 and that we use ourselves.

2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:01.320
 In addition, we've partnered with Thorne.

2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:02.900
 Thorne is a supplement company

2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:04.000
 and we've partnered with them

2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.240
 because they have the highest levels of stringency

2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:08.940
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients they use

2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:11.520
 and the quantity of the ingredients they use.

2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:14.080
 By quantity, I mean that unlike a lot

2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:15.900
 of supplement companies out there,

2:15:15.900 --> 2:15:17.960
 the amounts that are listed on the bottle

2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:19.440
 are absolutely what you find

2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:22.200
 in those capsules and tablets in the bottle.

2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:25.480
 If you go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E

2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:28.780
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:15:28.780 --> 2:15:30.880
 you can see the supplements that I take

2:15:30.880 --> 2:15:33.760
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements

2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:36.740
 as well as any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

2:15:36.740 --> 2:15:38.960
 Just go into the Thorne site through that portal,

2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:41.920
 Thorne slash U slash Huberman.

2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:45.100
 And even if you navigate off from that location in the site,

2:15:45.100 --> 2:15:47.840
 you'll get 20% off any of the items that you might select

2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:49.880
 from other locations within the Thorne site.

2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:52.440
 If you're not already following us on Instagram,

2:15:52.440 --> 2:15:54.680
 it's Hubermanlab at Instagram.

2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:58.240
 And there I do various tutorials about neuroscience,

2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:01.640
 offer neuroscience-related tools, all backed by science.

2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:02.880
 And last but not least,

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:04.760
 I thank you for your time and attention

2:16:04.760 --> 2:16:06.680
 and thank you for your interest in science.

2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:33.680
 I'll see you in the next one.
