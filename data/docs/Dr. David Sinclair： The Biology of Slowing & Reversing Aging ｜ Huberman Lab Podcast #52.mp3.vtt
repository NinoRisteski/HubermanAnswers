00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.600
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.600 --> 00:13.040
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.040 --> 00:14.960
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.320
 Today, my guest is Dr. David Sinclair,

00:17.320 --> 00:19.960
 professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School

00:19.960 --> 00:22.700
 and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center

00:22.700 --> 00:24.640
 for the Biology of Aging.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.800
 Dr. Sinclair's work is focused on why we age

00:27.800 --> 00:30.500
 and how to slow or reverse the effects of aging

00:30.500 --> 00:33.740
 by focusing on the cellular and molecular pathways

00:33.740 --> 00:36.080
 that exist in all cells of the body

00:36.080 --> 00:38.200
 and that progress those cells over time

00:38.200 --> 00:40.920
 from young cells to old cells.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.300
 By elucidating the biology of cellular maturation and aging,

00:45.300 --> 00:48.060
 Dr. Sinclair's group has figured out intervention points

00:48.060 --> 00:50.760
 by which any of us, indeed all of us,

00:50.760 --> 00:53.240
 can slow or reverse the effects of aging.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.580
 What is unique about his work

00:54.580 --> 00:57.080
 is that it focuses on behavioral interventions,

00:57.080 --> 00:58.760
 nutritional interventions,

00:58.760 --> 01:01.880
 as well as supplementation and prescription drug

01:01.880 --> 01:05.580
 interventions that can help us all age more slowly

01:05.580 --> 01:09.240
 and reverse the effects of aging in all tissues of the body.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.840
 Dr. Sinclair holds a unique and revolutionary view

01:11.840 --> 01:13.340
 of the aging process,

01:13.340 --> 01:17.000
 which is that aging is not the normal and natural consequence

01:17.000 --> 01:18.580
 that we all will suffer,

01:18.580 --> 01:20.780
 but rather that aging is a disease

01:20.780 --> 01:22.800
 that can be slowed or halted.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.680
 Dr. Sinclair continually publishes

01:24.680 --> 01:26.420
 original research articles

01:26.420 --> 01:29.920
 in the most prestigious and competitive scientific journals.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.880
 In addition to that,

01:30.880 --> 01:32.740
 he's published a popular book

01:32.740 --> 01:34.620
 that was a New York Times bestseller.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.320
 The title of that book is a lifespan,

01:36.320 --> 01:38.720
 why we age and why we don't have to.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.440
 He is also very active in public facing efforts

01:41.440 --> 01:43.600
 to educate people on the biology of aging

01:43.600 --> 01:45.740
 and slowing the aging process.

01:45.740 --> 01:48.800
 Dr. Sinclair and I share a mutual interest and excitement

01:48.800 --> 01:51.400
 in public education about science.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.480
 And so I'm thrilled to share with you that we've partnered

01:54.480 --> 01:56.760
 and Dr. David Sinclair is going to be launching

01:56.760 --> 01:58.020
 the lifespan podcast,

01:58.020 --> 01:59.840
 which is all about the biology of aging

01:59.840 --> 02:02.520
 and tools to intervene in the aging process.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.040
 That podcast will launch Wednesday, January 5th.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.580
 You can find it at the link in the show notes

02:08.580 --> 02:11.000
 to this episode today as well.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.440
 You can subscribe to that podcast on YouTube,

02:13.440 --> 02:16.280
 Apple or Spotify or anywhere that you get your podcasts.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.600
 Again, the lifespan podcast featuring Dr. David Sinclair

02:19.600 --> 02:22.640
 begins Wednesday, January 5th, 2022.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.580
 Be sure to check it out.

02:23.580 --> 02:26.080
 You're going to learn a tremendous amount of information

02:26.080 --> 02:28.800
 and you're going to learn both the mechanistic science

02:28.800 --> 02:31.000
 behind aging, the mechanistic science

02:31.000 --> 02:32.960
 behind reversing the aging process

02:32.960 --> 02:35.200
 and practical tools that you can apply

02:35.200 --> 02:36.760
 in your everyday life.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.640
 In today's episode, Dr. Sinclair and I talk about

02:39.640 --> 02:42.480
 the biology of aging and tools to intervene in that process.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.520
 And so you might view today's episode

02:44.520 --> 02:47.520
 as a primer for the lifespan podcast

02:47.520 --> 02:50.040
 because we delve deep into the behavioral tools,

02:50.040 --> 02:53.080
 nutritional aspects, supplementation aspects

02:53.080 --> 02:54.480
 of the biology of aging.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.920
 We also talk about David's important discoveries

02:56.920 --> 02:59.960
 of the sirtuins, particular molecular components

02:59.960 --> 03:02.200
 that influence what is called the epigenome.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.920
 And if you don't know what the epigenome is,

03:03.920 --> 03:05.880
 you will soon learn in today's episode.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.320
 Coming away from today's episode,

03:07.320 --> 03:10.240
 you will have in-depth knowledge about the biology of aging

03:10.240 --> 03:12.480
 at the cellular, molecular and what we call

03:12.480 --> 03:14.600
 the circuit level, meaning how the different organs

03:14.600 --> 03:16.900
 and tissues of the bodies age independently

03:16.900 --> 03:19.540
 and how they influence the aging of each other.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.500
 Today's episode gets into discussion

03:21.500 --> 03:25.000
 about many aspects of aging and tools to combat aging

03:25.000 --> 03:27.760
 that have not been discussed on any other podcasts

03:27.760 --> 03:29.760
 or in the book lifespan.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.620
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:32.620 --> 03:35.400
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:37.400 --> 03:39.920
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:39.920 --> 03:42.480
 and science related tools to the general public.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.480
 In keeping with that theme,

03:43.480 --> 03:46.240
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.120
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.400
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:50.400 --> 03:52.540
 that are the absolute highest quality.

03:52.540 --> 03:55.000
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.840
 I can tell you that the visual system has to contend

03:56.840 --> 03:58.600
 with a number of different challenges,

03:58.600 --> 04:01.260
 such as when you move from a bright area outside

04:01.260 --> 04:03.140
 to an area where there are shadows,

04:03.140 --> 04:05.340
 you have to adjust a number of things in your visual system

04:05.340 --> 04:07.200
 so that you can still see things clearly.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.860
 One problem with a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:09.860 --> 04:13.360
 is they don't take that biological feature into account

04:13.360 --> 04:15.860
 and you have to take off your glasses and put them back on

04:15.860 --> 04:19.060
 depending on how bright or dim a given environment is.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.060
 With Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,

04:21.060 --> 04:23.800
 you always see things with the utmost clarity.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.400
 In addition, they're very lightweight

04:25.400 --> 04:26.920
 and they won't slip off your face.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.220
 In fact, they were designed to be worn while biking

04:29.220 --> 04:30.800
 or running and in various activities,

04:30.800 --> 04:32.220
 but they also have a terrific aesthetic

04:32.220 --> 04:33.920
 so you could wear them to dinner or work.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.860
 I wear readers at night and when I drive

04:35.860 --> 04:38.200
 and I wear the sunglasses for most of the day.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.640
 If you'd like to try Roca sunglasses or eyeglasses,

04:40.640 --> 04:43.820

04:52.300 --> 04:55.300
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

04:55.300 --> 04:58.060
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:58.060 --> 05:00.780
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

05:00.780 --> 05:02.300
 to help you better understand your body

05:02.300 --> 05:04.380
 and help you reach your health goals.

05:04.380 --> 05:07.240
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

05:07.240 --> 05:09.360
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

05:09.360 --> 05:11.460
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

05:11.460 --> 05:14.140
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.840
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

05:16.840 --> 05:18.500
 you can also get a clear picture

05:18.500 --> 05:20.320
 of what your biological age is

05:20.320 --> 05:22.440
 and compare that to your chronological age.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.780
 And obviously your biological age is the important one

05:25.780 --> 05:28.040
 because it predicts how long you will live

05:28.040 --> 05:29.980
 and it's the one that you can control.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.380
 The great thing about Inside Tracker

05:32.380 --> 05:34.300
 is that compared to a lot of other DNA tests

05:34.300 --> 05:35.700
 and blood tests out there,

05:35.700 --> 05:37.140
 is that with Inside Tracker,

05:37.140 --> 05:38.660
 you don't just get your numbers back

05:38.660 --> 05:40.900
 at the levels of various hormones, metabolic factors,

05:40.900 --> 05:42.220
 blood lipids, et cetera,

05:42.220 --> 05:45.800
 but it also offers clear directives to lifestyle factors,

05:45.800 --> 05:48.100
 nutritional factors, and supplementation

05:48.100 --> 05:50.320
 that you can use in order to get the numbers

05:50.320 --> 05:53.660
 into the ranges that are best for you and for your health.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.060
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:55.060 --> 05:57.900

 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.500
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.940
 Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,

06:13.940 --> 06:15.860
 keto-friendly cereal.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.360
 I don't follow a strictly ketogenic diet.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.220
 What works best for me is to eat according to my desire

06:22.220 --> 06:23.900
 to be alert at certain times of day

06:23.900 --> 06:26.580
 and to be sleepy at other times of day.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.660
 So for me, that means fasting until about 11 a.m.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.060
 or 12 noon most days.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.580
 And then my lunch is typically a low carb, keto-ish lunch,

06:34.580 --> 06:36.320
 maybe a small piece of grass-fed meat,

06:36.320 --> 06:38.580
 some salad, something of that sort.

06:38.580 --> 06:39.660
 And then in the afternoon,

06:39.660 --> 06:42.900
 I might have a snack that's also keto-ish.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.140
 And then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates,

06:45.140 --> 06:47.260
 which for me helps me with the transition to sleep

06:47.260 --> 06:48.980
 and allows me to get great deep sleep.

06:48.980 --> 06:50.380
 That's what works for me.

06:50.380 --> 06:51.980
 What that means is that in the afternoon,

06:51.980 --> 06:56.060
 I'm craving a snack and the snack for me is Magic Spoon.

06:56.060 --> 06:58.420
 What I do lately is I put in some Bulgarian yogurt.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.440
 Sometimes I just eat it straight.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.100
 Each serving of Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,

07:03.100 --> 07:04.780
 13 to 14 grams of protein,

07:04.780 --> 07:07.620
 and only four grams of carbohydrates in each serving.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.420
 So it really matches that low carb, keto-ish approach.

07:11.420 --> 07:13.500
 There's only 140 calories per serving

07:13.500 --> 07:15.140
 and they have a variety of flavors,

07:15.140 --> 07:17.580
 cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.900
 I particularly like frosted because it tastes like donuts.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.660
 I try not to eat donuts, but I do love the frosted.

07:22.660 --> 07:23.660
 And as I mentioned before,

07:23.660 --> 07:25.820
 I lately mix it with yogurt, put a little cinnamon on there.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.900
 I'm getting hungry just talking about it now.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.240
 If you want to try Magic Spoon,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.740
 you can go to magicspoon.com slash Huberman

 and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.500
 And now my conversation with Dr. David Sinclair.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.380
 Thank you for coming.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.460
 Thanks for having me here.

07:47.460 --> 07:48.600
 It's good to see you.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.440
 This is Mate, by the way, that we're toasting at 11 AM.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.740
 Unlike other podcasts, well, I don't drink alcohol,

07:56.740 --> 07:58.980
 so I'm boring that way.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.060
 But truly, thanks for being here.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.820
 I have a ton of questions for you.

08:03.820 --> 08:06.620
 We go way back in some sense,

08:06.620 --> 08:09.740
 but that doesn't mean that I don't have many,

08:09.740 --> 08:14.580
 many questions about aging, longevity, lifespan,

08:14.580 --> 08:18.580
 actionable protocols to increase how long we live, et cetera.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.980
 And I just want to start off with a very simple question

08:21.980 --> 08:24.100
 that I'm not even sure there's an answer to,

08:24.100 --> 08:27.900
 but what is the difference between longevity,

08:27.900 --> 08:30.460
 anti-aging and aging as a disease?

08:30.460 --> 08:33.500
 Because I associate you with the statement,

08:33.500 --> 08:35.580
 aging is a disease.

08:35.580 --> 08:39.540
 Right, well, so longevity is the more academic way

08:39.540 --> 08:41.340
 we describe what we research.

08:41.340 --> 08:43.620
 Anti-aging is kind of the same thing,

08:43.620 --> 08:45.660
 but it's got a bad rap because it's been used

08:45.660 --> 08:46.500
 by a whole bunch of people

08:46.500 --> 08:48.300
 that don't know what they're talking about.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.680
 So I really don't like that term anti-aging,

08:50.680 --> 08:52.540
 but aging as a disease and longevity

08:52.540 --> 08:56.620
 are perfectly valid ways to talk about this subject.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.880
 So let's talk about aging as a disease.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.800
 When I started my research,

09:00.800 --> 09:03.980
 disease here at Harvard Medical School,

09:03.980 --> 09:06.100
 it was considered if there's something

09:06.100 --> 09:10.120
 that's wrong with you and it's a rare thing,

09:10.120 --> 09:12.760
 has to be less than 50% of the population,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.220
 that's definitely a disease.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.020
 And then people work their whole lives

09:16.020 --> 09:18.340
 to try and cure that condition.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.220
 And so I looked up what's the definition of aging

09:20.220 --> 09:21.860
 and it says, well, it's a deterioration

09:21.860 --> 09:24.360
 and in health and sickness and you can die from it,

09:24.360 --> 09:25.380
 typically you do.

09:26.260 --> 09:28.740
 Something that sounds pretty much like a disease,

09:28.740 --> 09:32.320
 but the caveat is that if more than half the population

09:32.320 --> 09:34.860
 gets this condition, aging,

09:34.860 --> 09:36.420
 it's put in a different bucket,

09:36.420 --> 09:37.980
 which is first of all, that's outrageous

09:37.980 --> 09:40.780
 because it's just a totally arbitrary cutoff.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.620
 But think about this,

09:41.620 --> 09:45.400
 that we're ignoring the major cause of all these diseases.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.180
 Aging is 80 to 90% the cause of heart disease, Alzheimer's.

09:49.180 --> 09:52.060
 If we didn't get old and our bodies stayed youthful,

09:52.060 --> 09:53.380
 we would not get those diseases.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.980
 And actually what we're showing in my labels,

09:54.980 --> 09:57.580
 if you turn the clock back in tissues,

09:57.580 --> 09:59.140
 those diseases go away.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.620
 So aging is the problem.

10:00.620 --> 10:04.100
 And instead through most of the last 200 years,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.120
 we've been sticking band-aids on diseases

10:06.120 --> 10:08.560
 that have already occurred because of aging

10:08.560 --> 10:10.300
 and then it's too late.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.180
 So there are a couple of things.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.500
 One is we want to slow aging down

10:12.500 --> 10:14.260
 so we don't get those diseases.

10:14.260 --> 10:16.860
 And when they do occur, don't just stick a band-aid on,

10:16.860 --> 10:18.020
 reverse the age of the body

10:18.020 --> 10:20.320
 and then the diseases will go away.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.260
 That clarifies a lot for me, thank you.

10:23.400 --> 10:28.220
 Can we point to one specific general phenomenon in the body

10:28.220 --> 10:30.020
 that underlies aging?

10:30.020 --> 10:31.860
 Yeah, well, that's contentious

10:31.860 --> 10:35.740
 because scientists like to come up with new hypotheses.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.220
 It's how they build their careers.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.820
 But fortunately during the 2000s,

10:39.820 --> 10:43.460
 we settled on eight or nine major causes of aging.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.460
 We called them hallmarks

10:44.460 --> 10:47.200
 because causes was a little bit too strong.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.420
 But these eight or nine causes,

10:49.420 --> 10:50.420
 at least for the first time,

10:50.420 --> 10:53.460
 allowed us to come around and talk together.

10:53.460 --> 10:55.700
 We put them on a pizza

10:55.700 --> 10:59.060
 so everyone got an equal weighting, equal slices.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.500
 But before that, by the way,

11:00.500 --> 11:02.620
 we were trying to kill each other in the field.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.740
 It was horrible.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.340
 Interesting that you guys work on aging

11:05.340 --> 11:06.180
 and you're trying to kill each other.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.020
 Yeah, isn't it?

11:07.020 --> 11:08.880
 Well, kill each other's careers.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.620
 I mean, I like to think I was fairly generous,

11:10.620 --> 11:11.940
 but I was one of the kids

11:11.940 --> 11:14.020
 and the old guard really didn't like the new guard.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.540
 We just came along in the 1990s and 90s

11:16.540 --> 11:19.240
 and said free radicals don't do much.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.540
 There were actually genes called longevity genes

11:21.540 --> 11:22.820
 and that caused a whole ruckus.

11:22.820 --> 11:27.700
 And there was this competition for what never happened,

11:27.700 --> 11:29.720
 which was a Nobel Prize for this.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.540
 And it just led to a lot of competition.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.460
 I would go to meetings

11:33.460 --> 11:36.020
 and people would shout at each other and backstab.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.420
 It was horrible.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.660
 But then fortunately in the 2000s,

11:38.660 --> 11:41.860
 we rallied around this new map of aging

11:41.860 --> 11:44.520
 with these causes or hallmarks.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.860
 But I think that there's one slice of the pizza

11:46.860 --> 11:48.900
 that is way larger than the others.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.880
 And we can get to that,

11:49.880 --> 11:52.140
 but that's the information in the cell

11:52.140 --> 11:54.140
 that we call the epigenome.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.280
 Well, tell us a little bit more about the epigenome.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.540
 Frame it for us, if you will.

11:59.540 --> 12:01.620
 And then we'll get into ways

12:01.620 --> 12:05.500
 that one can adjust the epigenome in positive ways.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.660
 Yeah, so in science, what I like to do,

12:07.660 --> 12:10.140
 I'm a reductionist, is to boil it down.

12:10.140 --> 12:14.100
 And I actually ended up boiling aging down to an equation,

12:14.100 --> 12:17.780
 which is the loss of information due to entropy.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.860
 It's a hard thing to overcome

12:18.860 --> 12:21.380
 the second law of thermodynamics, that's fair.

12:21.380 --> 12:24.340
 But this equation really represents the fact

12:24.340 --> 12:27.500
 that I think aging is a loss of information

12:27.500 --> 12:31.700
 in the same way that when you Xerox something

12:31.700 --> 12:33.560
 a thousand times, you'll lose that information,

12:33.560 --> 12:35.420
 or you try to copy a cassette tape,

12:35.420 --> 12:37.360
 or even if you send information across the internet,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.400
 some of it will get lost.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.100
 That's what I think is aging.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.500
 And there are two types of information in the body.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.500
 There is the genetic information, which is digital,

12:46.500 --> 12:49.260
 ATCG, the chemical letters of DNA.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.740
 But there's this other part of the information in the body

12:51.740 --> 12:53.500
 that's just as important.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.860
 It's essential, in fact.

12:54.860 --> 12:57.820
 And that's the systems that control

12:57.820 --> 12:59.720
 which genes are switched on and off,

12:59.720 --> 13:01.540
 in what cell, at what time,

13:01.540 --> 13:03.860
 in response to what we eat, et cetera.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.580
 And it turns out that 80% of our future longevity

13:06.580 --> 13:08.860
 and health is controlled by this second part,

13:08.860 --> 13:11.860
 the epigenetic information, the control systems.

13:11.860 --> 13:15.740
 I liken the DNA to the music that's on a DVD

13:15.740 --> 13:16.580
 or a compact disc.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.260
 For the younger people, we used to use these things.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.080
 I recall.

13:19.080 --> 13:19.920
 Yep.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.600
 And then the epigenome is the reader that says,

13:21.600 --> 13:25.700
 okay, in this cell, we need to play that set of songs.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.540
 And in this other cell,

13:26.540 --> 13:28.340
 we have to play a different set of songs.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.020
 But over time, aging is the equivalent

13:30.020 --> 13:32.260
 of scratching the CD and the DVD

13:32.260 --> 13:34.520
 so that you're not playing the right songs.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.640
 And cells, when they don't hear the right songs,

13:37.640 --> 13:40.180
 they get messed up and they don't function well.

13:40.180 --> 13:43.360
 And that is what I'm saying is the main driver of aging.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.060
 And these other hallmarks

13:45.060 --> 13:47.580
 are largely manifestations of that process.

13:47.580 --> 13:52.140
 Can we go a little deeper into what these scratches are?

13:52.140 --> 13:57.020
 Is it the way that the DNA are packed into a cell?

13:57.020 --> 14:00.860
 Is it the way that they're spaced?

14:00.860 --> 14:04.700
 What are the scratches that you're referring to?

14:04.700 --> 14:06.660
 So DNA is six foot long.

14:06.660 --> 14:07.820
 If you join your chromosomes together,

14:07.820 --> 14:09.880
 you get about six foot per cell.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.080
 So there's enough to go to the moon

14:11.080 --> 14:12.740
 and back eight times in your body.

14:12.740 --> 14:16.140
 And it has to be wrapped up to exist inside us.

14:16.140 --> 14:18.260
 But it's not just wrapped up willy-nilly.

14:18.260 --> 14:20.340
 It's not just a bundle of string.

14:20.340 --> 14:22.140
 It's wrapped up very carefully in ways

14:22.140 --> 14:25.360
 that dictates which genes are switched on and off.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.740
 And when we're developing in the embryo,

14:27.740 --> 14:30.800
 the cell marks the DNA with chemicals that says,

14:30.800 --> 14:32.780
 okay, this gene is for a nerve cell.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.380
 You, you cell, will stay a nerve cell

14:35.380 --> 14:37.620
 for the next hundred years, if you're lucky.

14:37.620 --> 14:38.900
 Don't turn into a skin cell.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.540
 That would be bad.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.660
 And those chemicals,

14:42.660 --> 14:43.920
 there are many different types of chemicals,

14:43.920 --> 14:45.500
 but one's called methylation.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.860
 Those little methyls will mark which songs get played

14:48.860 --> 14:50.360
 for the rest of your life.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.740
 And there are other marks that change daily.

14:52.740 --> 14:54.820
 But in total, what we're saying is that

14:54.820 --> 14:58.340
 the body controls the genome through the ability

14:58.340 --> 15:03.340
 to mark the DNA and then compact some parts of it,

15:03.360 --> 15:05.980
 silence those genes, don't read those genes,

15:05.980 --> 15:09.820
 and open others, keep others open that should stay open.

15:09.820 --> 15:13.620
 And that pattern of genes that are silent and open,

15:13.620 --> 15:16.980
 silent open, is what dictates the cell's type,

15:16.980 --> 15:18.340
 the cell's function.

15:18.340 --> 15:21.140
 And then the scratches are the disruption of that.

15:21.140 --> 15:24.180
 So genes that were once silent,

15:24.180 --> 15:28.540
 and you could say it's a gene that is involved in skin,

15:28.540 --> 15:29.940
 it's starting to come on in the brain,

15:29.940 --> 15:32.060
 shouldn't be there, but we see this happen,

15:32.060 --> 15:33.940
 and vice versa, the gene might get shut off

15:33.940 --> 15:35.500
 over time during aging.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.460
 Cells over time lose these structures,

15:38.460 --> 15:39.480
 lose their identity,

15:39.480 --> 15:41.700
 they forget what they're supposed to do,

15:41.700 --> 15:43.300
 and we get diseases.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.100
 We call that aging, and we can measure that.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.780
 In fact, we can measure it in such a way

15:47.780 --> 15:49.980
 that we can predict when somebody's going to die

15:49.980 --> 15:53.400
 based on the changes in those chemicals.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.740
 Are these changes the same sorts of changes

15:55.740 --> 16:00.580
 that underlie the outward body surface manifestations

16:00.580 --> 16:02.340
 of aging that most of us are familiar with?

16:02.340 --> 16:04.400
 Graying of the hair, wrinkling of the skin,

16:04.400 --> 16:07.020
 drooping of the face.

16:09.020 --> 16:11.940
 Walking around New York lately, it's amazing to me,

16:11.940 --> 16:14.100
 there are certain people that seem to walk

16:14.100 --> 16:15.500
 looking down at the sidewalk

16:15.500 --> 16:19.740
 because their spine is essentially in a C-shape, right?

16:19.740 --> 16:21.260
 A hallmark, if you will,

16:21.260 --> 16:23.760
 of aging that most of us are familiar with.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.860
 Are these same sorts of DNA scratches associated with that,

16:26.860 --> 16:27.940
 or are we talking about people

16:27.940 --> 16:30.200
 that potentially are going to look older,

16:30.200 --> 16:32.160
 but simply live longer?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.940
 Well, it's actually, you are as old as you look

16:34.940 --> 16:36.720
 if you want to generalize.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.260
 So let's start with centenarian families.

16:39.260 --> 16:42.020
 These are families that tend to live over 100.

16:42.020 --> 16:45.020
 When they're 70, they still look 50 or less.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.540
 So it is a good indicator.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.980
 It's not perfect because you can,

16:48.980 --> 16:50.740
 like me, grow up in Australia

16:50.740 --> 16:54.020
 and accelerate the aging of your skin,

16:54.020 --> 16:55.560
 but in general, how you look.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.460
 No one's ever died from gray hair,

16:57.460 --> 16:59.360
 but overall, you can get a sense

16:59.360 --> 17:02.540
 just from the ability of skin to hold itself up,

17:02.540 --> 17:04.640
 how thin it is, the number of wrinkles.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.440
 That is actually, a great paper just came out

17:07.440 --> 17:10.060
 that said that an AI system looking at the face

17:10.060 --> 17:12.240
 could very accurately predict someone's age.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.700
 Very interesting.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.920
 So I started off in developmental neurobiology.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.500
 So one of the things that I learned early on

17:19.500 --> 17:22.620
 that I still believe wholeheartedly

17:22.620 --> 17:27.620
 is that development doesn't stop at age 12 or 15,

17:27.760 --> 17:30.700
 or even 25, that your entire life

17:30.700 --> 17:34.160
 is one long developmental arc, right?

17:35.100 --> 17:37.220
 So in thinking about different portions

17:37.220 --> 17:38.760
 of that developmental arc,

17:38.760 --> 17:43.260
 the early portion of infancy and especially puberty

17:43.260 --> 17:47.060
 seem like especially rapid stages of aging.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.740
 And I know we normally look at babies and children

17:49.740 --> 17:50.880
 and kids in puberty and we think,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.860
 oh, they're so vital, they're so young.

17:53.860 --> 17:58.140
 And yet the way you describe these changes in the epigenome

17:58.140 --> 18:01.060
 and the way you have framed aging as a disease

18:01.060 --> 18:06.060
 leads me to ask, are periods of immense vitality,

18:07.700 --> 18:11.340
 the same periods when we're aging faster?

18:11.340 --> 18:15.060
 Yes, yes, and this is something I've never talked about,

18:15.060 --> 18:18.100
 at least not publicly, so this is a really good question.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.260
 So those chemicals we can measure,

18:20.260 --> 18:21.700
 it's also known as the Horvath clock,

18:21.700 --> 18:22.900
 it's the biological clock,

18:22.900 --> 18:25.300
 it's separate from your chronological age.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.140
 So actually what I didn't mention is that

18:27.140 --> 18:29.580
 when the AI looked at the faces of those people,

18:29.580 --> 18:33.460
 they could predict their biological age, their internal age.

18:33.460 --> 18:36.820
 So your skin represents the age of your organs as well.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.540
 And the people that look after themselves,

18:38.540 --> 18:40.500
 we can talk about how to do that later,

18:40.500 --> 18:42.860
 but there are some people that are 10, 20 years younger

18:42.860 --> 18:46.100
 than other people biologically.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.460
 And it turns out if you measure that clock from birth

18:48.460 --> 18:50.860
 or even before birth, if you look at animals,

18:50.860 --> 18:53.380
 there's a massive increase in age

18:53.380 --> 18:55.940
 based on that clock early in life.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.460
 So you're right, so that's a really important point

18:58.460 --> 19:00.460
 that you have accelerated aging

19:00.460 --> 19:02.100
 during the first few years of life,

19:02.100 --> 19:05.500
 and then it goes linear towards the rest of your life.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.980
 But there's another interesting thing you brought up,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.740
 which is that we're finding that the genes

19:08.740 --> 19:11.060
 that get messed up, that get scratched,

19:11.060 --> 19:13.060
 that are leading to aging

19:13.060 --> 19:15.500
 are those early developmental genes.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.020
 They come on late in life and just mess up the system,

19:19.020 --> 19:20.820
 and they seem to be particularly susceptible

19:20.820 --> 19:22.500
 to those scratches.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.260
 So what's causing the scratches?

19:24.260 --> 19:25.900
 Well, we know of a couple of things in my lab,

19:25.900 --> 19:30.140
 we figured out one is broken chromosomes, DNA damage,

19:30.140 --> 19:32.300
 particularly cuts to the DNA breaks.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.340
 So if you have an X-ray or a cosmic ray,

19:35.340 --> 19:36.700
 or even if you go out in the sun

19:36.700 --> 19:38.820
 and you'll get your broken chromosomes,

19:38.820 --> 19:41.460
 that accelerates the unwinding

19:41.460 --> 19:44.380
 of those beautiful DNA loops that I mentioned.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.860
 We can actually do this to a mouse.

19:47.860 --> 19:50.140
 We can accelerate that process,

19:50.140 --> 19:52.500
 and we get an old mouse, 50% older,

19:52.500 --> 19:54.660
 and it has this bent spine kyphosis,

19:54.660 --> 19:56.820
 it has gray hair, its organs are old.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.940
 So we now can control aging in the forwards direction.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.540
 The other thing that accelerates aging

20:01.540 --> 20:05.180
 is massive cell damage or stress.

20:05.180 --> 20:07.260
 So we pinched nerves,

20:07.260 --> 20:09.100
 and we saw that their aging process

20:09.100 --> 20:10.580
 was accelerated as well.

20:10.580 --> 20:11.420
 Incredible.

20:11.420 --> 20:15.060
 Yeah, this is more of an anecdotal phenomenon.

20:15.060 --> 20:16.780
 It is an anecdotal phenomenon,

20:16.780 --> 20:20.260
 but this experience of in junior high school,

20:20.260 --> 20:23.420
 you know, going home for a summer and you come back,

20:23.420 --> 20:26.100
 high school in the US usually starts eighth or ninth grade

20:26.100 --> 20:28.540
 or grade eight or grade nine for your Canadians.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.580
 And then some of the kids,

20:32.580 --> 20:34.620
 like they grew beards over the summer,

20:34.620 --> 20:37.780
 or they completely matured quickly over the summer.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.540
 Do you think there's any reason to believe

20:39.540 --> 20:42.900
 that rates of entry into and through puberty

20:44.060 --> 20:47.260
 can predict overall rates of aging?

20:47.260 --> 20:52.260
 In other words, if a kid is a slow burner, right?

20:52.260 --> 20:57.020
 They basically acquire the traits of puberty

20:57.020 --> 20:59.020
 slowly over many years.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.820
 Can we make some course prediction

21:01.820 --> 21:03.740
 that they are going to live a long time

21:03.740 --> 21:05.740
 versus a kid that goes home for the summer

21:05.740 --> 21:08.380
 and comes back a completely different organism

21:08.380 --> 21:10.780
 or appearing to be a completely different organism?

21:10.780 --> 21:12.700
 Like they basically age very quickly in the summer.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.900
 Does that mean they're aging very quickly overall?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.780
 Well, yeah, I don't want to scare anybody.

21:16.780 --> 21:17.620
 Sure.

21:17.620 --> 21:21.540
 There are studies that show that

21:21.540 --> 21:23.460
 the slower you take to develop,

21:23.460 --> 21:26.380
 it also is predictive of having a longer, healthier life.

21:27.540 --> 21:30.100
 And it may have something to do with growth hormone.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.660
 We know that growth hormone is pro-aging.

21:33.780 --> 21:37.260
 Anyone who's taking growth hormone, pay attention.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.820
 We notice, look at someone who's taking growth hormone.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.940
 They often will acquire these characteristics of vitality,

21:42.940 --> 21:44.780
 like improved smoothness of skin,

21:44.780 --> 21:47.060
 but their whole body shape changes.

21:47.060 --> 21:50.260
 Yeah, I mean, you'll feel better for a short amount of time.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.100
 You'll build up muscle, you'll feel great,

21:52.100 --> 21:54.660
 but it's like burning your candle at both ends.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.660
 Ultimately, if you want to live longer,

21:56.660 --> 21:57.700
 you want less of that.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.620
 And the animals that have been generated

22:00.620 --> 22:03.140
 and mutants that have low growth hormone,

22:03.140 --> 22:04.620
 sometimes these are dwarfs,

22:05.540 --> 22:07.660
 they live the longest by far.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.020
 A guy in my lab, Michael Bonkowski,

22:10.020 --> 22:11.820
 he had the longest lived mouse.

22:11.820 --> 22:14.340
 A mouse typically lives about two and a bit years.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.420
 He had a mouse that lived five years

22:16.420 --> 22:18.980
 and he gave it caloric restrictions for fasting

22:18.980 --> 22:20.820
 combined with one of these dwarf mutations,

22:20.820 --> 22:22.180
 low growth hormone.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.900
 I think he called it Yoda.

22:23.900 --> 22:27.580
 But you look at who lives the longest,

22:27.580 --> 22:29.500
 it's the really small people.

22:30.460 --> 22:31.460
 This is a bit anecdotal,

22:31.460 --> 22:34.380
 but it sounds like it might be true

22:34.380 --> 22:36.140
 is that the people who played the Munchkins

22:36.140 --> 22:37.300
 in the Wizard of Oz,

22:37.300 --> 22:39.940
 many of them went on to live into their 90s and beyond.

22:39.940 --> 22:41.780
 Really? Yeah.

22:41.780 --> 22:42.620
 Amazing.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.980
 Oh, there are some Laurent dwarfs as well.

22:44.980 --> 22:49.180
 There are dwarf mutations in South America

22:49.180 --> 22:50.380
 and they seem to be protected

22:50.380 --> 22:52.220
 against many of the diseases of aging.

22:52.220 --> 22:53.620
 You barely ever see heart disease

22:53.620 --> 22:55.380
 or cancer in these families.

22:55.380 --> 22:58.580
 So I, having owned a very large dog breed,

22:58.580 --> 23:01.660
 a Bulldog Mastiff who lived a long life

23:01.660 --> 23:03.140
 for a bulldog, 11 years,

23:03.140 --> 23:07.540
 but there are many dogs that will live 12, 16 years

23:07.540 --> 23:08.860
 that are smaller dogs.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.860
 Can we say that there's a direct relationship

23:10.860 --> 23:13.180
 between body size and longevity

23:13.180 --> 23:16.260
 or duration of life?

23:16.260 --> 23:17.580
 Well, there is,

23:17.580 --> 23:19.260
 but that doesn't mean that you're a slave

23:19.260 --> 23:21.660
 to your early epigenome,

23:21.660 --> 23:23.260
 nor to your genome.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.260
 The good news is that the epigenome can change.

23:26.260 --> 23:29.180
 Those loops and structures can be modified

23:29.180 --> 23:30.860
 by how you live your life.

23:30.860 --> 23:33.580
 And so if you're born tall and I wasn't,

23:33.580 --> 23:36.500
 and I wished at the time I did grow,

23:37.500 --> 23:38.860
 but no matter what size you are,

23:38.860 --> 23:41.020
 you can have a bigger impact on your life

23:41.020 --> 23:42.940
 than anything your genes give you.

23:42.940 --> 23:45.900
 80% is epigenetic, not genetic.

23:45.900 --> 23:48.220
 So let's talk about some of the things that people can do.

23:48.220 --> 23:51.380
 And I've kind of batched these into categories

23:51.380 --> 23:56.380
 rather than just diving right into actionable protocols.

23:56.580 --> 24:01.580
 So the first one relates to food, blood sugar, insulin.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.580
 This is something I hear a lot about

24:04.580 --> 24:06.340
 that fasting is good for us,

24:07.180 --> 24:10.100
 but rarely do I hear why it's good for us.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.860
 One of the reasons I'm excited to talk to you today

24:12.860 --> 24:15.660
 is because I want to drill into the details of this,

24:15.660 --> 24:17.580
 because I think understanding the mechanism

24:17.580 --> 24:19.860
 will allow people to make better choices

24:19.860 --> 24:22.260
 and not simply to just decide

24:22.260 --> 24:24.060
 whether or not they're going to fast or not fast

24:24.060 --> 24:25.620
 or how long they're going to fast,

24:25.620 --> 24:26.500
 I think should be dictated

24:26.500 --> 24:28.460
 by some understanding of the mechanism.

24:28.460 --> 24:32.900
 So why is it that having elevated blood sugar,

24:32.900 --> 24:36.620
 glucose, and insulin ages us more quickly?

24:36.620 --> 24:40.820
 And or why is it that having periods of time each day

24:40.820 --> 24:45.180
 or perhaps longer can extend our lifespan?

24:45.180 --> 24:48.340
 Well, let's start with what I think was a big mistake

24:48.340 --> 24:52.140
 was the idea that people should never be hungry.

24:52.140 --> 24:53.100
 We live in a world now

24:53.100 --> 24:55.460
 where there's at least three meals a day,

24:55.460 --> 24:57.780
 and then we've got companies selling bars

24:57.780 --> 24:59.860
 and snacks in between.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.220
 So the feeling of hunger,

25:01.220 --> 25:03.860
 some people never experience hunger in their whole lives.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.900
 It's really, really bad for them.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.700
 It was based, I believe, on the 20th century view

25:10.700 --> 25:13.020
 that you don't want to stress out the pancreas

25:13.020 --> 25:16.540
 and you try to keep insulin levels pretty steady

25:16.540 --> 25:19.380
 and not have this fluctuation.

25:19.380 --> 25:23.420
 What we actually found, my colleagues and I,

25:23.420 --> 25:25.780
 across this field of longevity

25:25.780 --> 25:28.180
 is that when you look at, first of all, animals,

25:28.180 --> 25:31.420
 whether it's a dog or a mouse or a monkey,

25:31.420 --> 25:35.740
 the ones that live the longest, by far, 30% longer

25:35.740 --> 25:40.100
 and stay healthy are the ones that don't eat all the time.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.380
 It actually was first discovered

25:41.380 --> 25:44.500
 back in the early 20th century, but people ignored it.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.020
 And then it was rediscovered in the 1930s.

25:47.020 --> 25:49.220
 Clive McKay did caloric restriction.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.980
 He put cellulose in the food of rats

25:51.980 --> 25:54.620
 so they couldn't get as many calories even though they ate,

25:54.620 --> 25:57.140
 and those rats lived 30% longer.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.700
 But then it went away, and then it came back in the 2000s

26:00.700 --> 26:02.700
 in a big way when a couple of things happened.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.580
 One is that my lab and others showed

26:05.580 --> 26:08.860
 that there are longevity genes in the body

26:08.860 --> 26:11.980
 that come on and protect us from aging and disease.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.940
 The group of genes that I work on are called sirtuins.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.420
 There's seven of them.

26:15.420 --> 26:18.620
 And we showed in 2005 in a science paper

26:18.620 --> 26:22.340
 that if you have low levels of insulin

26:22.340 --> 26:25.780
 and another molecule called insulin-like growth factor,

26:25.780 --> 26:28.820
 those low levels turn on the longevity genes.

26:28.820 --> 26:32.140
 One of them that's really important is called SIRT1.

26:32.140 --> 26:35.340
 But by having high levels of insulin all day,

26:35.340 --> 26:39.220
 being fed means your longevity genes are not switched on.

26:39.220 --> 26:40.300
 So you're falling apart.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.500
 Your epigenome, your information

26:42.500 --> 26:44.140
 that keeps your cells functioning over time

26:44.140 --> 26:45.180
 just degrades quickly.

26:45.180 --> 26:48.940
 Your clock is ticking faster by always being fed.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.260
 The other thing that I think might be happening

26:53.260 --> 26:54.860
 by always having food around

26:55.860 --> 27:00.300
 is that it's not allowing the cell to have periods of rest

27:00.300 --> 27:03.300
 and reestablish the epigenome.

27:03.300 --> 27:06.660
 And so it also is accelerating in that direction.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.060
 There's plenty of other reasons as well

27:09.060 --> 27:10.060
 that are not as profound,

27:10.060 --> 27:14.260
 such as having low levels of glucose in your body

27:14.260 --> 27:17.020
 will trigger your major muscles in your brain

27:17.020 --> 27:19.660
 to become more sensitive to insulin

27:19.660 --> 27:21.660
 and suck the glucose out of your bloodstream,

27:21.660 --> 27:22.740
 which is very good.

27:22.740 --> 27:25.540
 You don't want to have glucose flowing around too much.

27:25.540 --> 27:27.900
 And that will ward off type 2 diabetes.

27:27.900 --> 27:32.260
 So hunger, of course, is associated with low blood glucose

27:32.260 --> 27:34.100
 and low insulin.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.180
 Do you think there's anything

27:35.180 --> 27:38.060
 about the subjective experience of hunger itself

27:38.060 --> 27:40.260
 that could be beneficial for longevity?

27:40.260 --> 27:42.140
 Yeah, I do.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.740
 Though you get used to the feeling of not eating.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.180
 So I'm kind of screwed that way.

27:49.180 --> 27:50.100
 It's like cold water.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.420
 You eventually adapt.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.980
 You get used to it, unfortunately.

27:53.980 --> 27:55.820
 But there are some studies that are being done

27:55.820 --> 27:57.460
 at the National Institutes of Health

27:57.460 --> 28:00.780
 that are able to simulate the effect of hunger,

28:00.780 --> 28:02.420
 but still provide the calories.

28:02.420 --> 28:04.700
 And it's looking like there's a small component

28:04.700 --> 28:05.980
 that's due to hunger.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.420
 But most of it, actually,

28:07.420 --> 28:10.300
 is because you've got these periods of not being fed

28:10.300 --> 28:12.700
 and then the body turns on these defensive genes.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.300
 There's a really interesting experiment

28:15.300 --> 28:17.220
 that was published maybe a couple of years ago

28:17.220 --> 28:20.060
 by Rafael de Carbo down at the NIH.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.060
 What he did was he took over 10,000 mice

28:22.060 --> 28:24.140
 and gave them different combinations

28:24.140 --> 28:26.740
 of fat, carbohydrate, protein.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.980
 And he was trying to figure out what was the best combination.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.700
 And then he also cleverly had a group,

28:32.700 --> 28:35.060
 well, two groups, one that was fed all the time,

28:35.060 --> 28:37.260
 or ate as much as they wanted,

28:37.260 --> 28:40.500
 and the other group was only given food for an hour a day.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.340
 And it turns out they ate

28:41.340 --> 28:43.060
 roughly the same amount of calories.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.380
 Because, of course, in an hour,

28:44.380 --> 28:46.700
 they're stuffing their faces.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.780
 It turns out it didn't matter what diet he gave them.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.620
 It was only the group that ate within that window

28:51.620 --> 28:53.940
 that lived longer and dramatically longer.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.020
 So my conclusion is,

28:56.020 --> 28:58.020
 and mice are very similar to us metabolically,

28:58.020 --> 29:00.460
 I think that tells us that it's not as important

29:00.460 --> 29:02.860
 what you eat, it's when you eat during the day.

29:02.860 --> 29:06.820
 What is the protocol that people can extrapolate from that?

29:07.980 --> 29:09.100
 Or maybe I should just ask you,

29:09.100 --> 29:12.340
 what is your protocol for when to eat

29:12.340 --> 29:14.100
 and when to avoid food?

29:14.100 --> 29:18.580
 Do you fast, do you ever fast longer than 24 hours?

29:18.580 --> 29:19.500
 What do you do?

29:19.500 --> 29:21.660
 And what do you think is a good jumping off place

29:21.660 --> 29:23.940
 if people want to explore this as a protocol?

29:23.940 --> 29:26.060
 Well, if there's one thing I could say,

29:26.060 --> 29:29.700
 if I would say definitely try to skip a meal a day,

29:29.700 --> 29:30.740
 that's the best thing.

29:30.740 --> 29:32.060
 Does it matter which meal?

29:32.060 --> 29:33.140
 Or are they essentially equivalent?

29:33.140 --> 29:35.020
 Well, as long as it's at the end

29:35.020 --> 29:36.180
 or the beginning of the day,

29:36.180 --> 29:38.660
 because then you add that to the sleep period

29:38.660 --> 29:40.260
 where you're hopefully not eating.

29:40.260 --> 29:41.700
 I think that that's an excellent point.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.020
 I realize it's a simple one,

29:43.020 --> 29:44.020
 but I think it's an excellent one

29:44.020 --> 29:45.460
 because I think one of the things

29:45.460 --> 29:46.660
 that people struggle with the most

29:46.660 --> 29:49.620
 is knowing when and how to initiate

29:49.620 --> 29:51.820
 this so-called intermittent fasting.

29:51.820 --> 29:53.540
 And the middle of the day obviously

29:53.540 --> 29:55.500
 is not tacked to the sleep cycle in the same way.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.980
 So it's much harder as well for many people.

29:58.980 --> 29:59.900
 Yeah. Yeah.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.580
 Well, I'll tell you what I do.

30:01.580 --> 30:02.740
 I skip breakfast.

30:02.740 --> 30:04.940
 I have a tiny bit of yogurt or olive oil

30:04.940 --> 30:08.260
 because the supplements I have need to be dissolved in it.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.700
 And then I go throughout the whole day

30:09.700 --> 30:13.820
 as I'm doing right now here with this glass of water here.

30:13.820 --> 30:15.860
 I'm just keeping myself filled with liquids.

30:15.860 --> 30:17.340
 And so I don't feel hungry.

30:18.980 --> 30:21.020
 Beware that the first two to three weeks

30:21.020 --> 30:22.820
 when you try that, you will feel hungry.

30:22.820 --> 30:26.180
 And you also have a habit of wanting to chew on something.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.260
 There's a lot of physical parts to it,

30:28.260 --> 30:30.180
 but try to make it through the first three weeks

30:30.180 --> 30:33.220
 and do without breakfast or do without dinner.

30:33.220 --> 30:34.860
 And you'll get through it.

30:34.860 --> 30:38.300
 And I did that for most of my life actually,

30:38.300 --> 30:40.700
 mainly because I wasn't hungry in the morning.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.420
 Some people are very hungry in the morning

30:42.420 --> 30:45.180
 and they may want to consider skipping dinner instead.

30:45.180 --> 30:47.100
 But I will go throughout the whole day.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.980
 I don't get the crashes of the high glucose

30:49.980 --> 30:51.780
 and the low glucose.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.740
 Anyone who goes, oh man, it's three o'clock.

30:53.740 --> 30:55.100
 I'm gonna need a sleep.

30:55.100 --> 30:58.420
 If you do what I do, you will not experience that anymore.

30:58.420 --> 31:01.460
 Because what my body does is it regulates

31:01.460 --> 31:02.820
 blood sugar levels naturally.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.020
 My liver is putting out glucose when it needs to

31:05.020 --> 31:07.620
 and it's very steady and gives me pure focus

31:07.620 --> 31:08.460
 throughout the day.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.020
 And I don't even have to think about lunch.

31:10.020 --> 31:11.660
 I'm just powering through.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.500
 At dinner, I love food as much as anybody.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.900
 So I will eat a regular, pretty healthy meal.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.540
 I'll try to eat mostly vegetables.

31:20.540 --> 31:23.300
 I can eat some fish, some shrimp.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.900
 I rarely will eat a steak.

31:25.900 --> 31:29.220
 In fact, my microbiome is so adapted to my diet.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.980
 Now, if I eat a steak, it will not get digested very well.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.740
 I'll feel terrible.

31:33.740 --> 31:36.180
 If I don't eat a steak, I feel terrible.

31:36.180 --> 31:37.020
 Well, we...

31:37.020 --> 31:37.980
 Argentine lineage.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.700
 Well, we can talk about that.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.900
 Well, everybody's different.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.860
 I mean, that's the other thing.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.820
 What works for me may not be perfect for you.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.620
 And we do have to measure things to know what's working.

31:47.620 --> 31:48.740
 I rarely eat dessert.

31:48.740 --> 31:53.060
 I gave up dessert and sugar when I turned 40.

31:53.060 --> 31:55.500
 And occasionally, I'll steal a bit of dessert

31:55.500 --> 31:57.780
 because it doesn't hurt if you steal it, right?

31:57.780 --> 32:00.380
 But other than that, I avoid sugar,

32:00.380 --> 32:04.940
 which includes simple carbohydrates, bread I try to avoid.

32:04.940 --> 32:07.980
 I've actually noticed, this is just a side note.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.180
 I used to get buildup of plaque pretty easily.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.260
 And every time I went to the dentist,

32:11.260 --> 32:12.180
 they'd have to scrape it off.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.540
 And I even bought tools to scrape it off

32:13.540 --> 32:15.700
 because it was driving me nuts.

32:15.700 --> 32:16.940
 I don't get plaque anymore.

32:16.940 --> 32:18.900
 And I think it's because of my diet.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.340
 I don't have those sugars in my mouth

32:20.340 --> 32:21.340
 that the bacteria feed on

32:21.340 --> 32:24.060
 and then form the biofilm on the teeth.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.660
 Much better breath, by the way.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.380
 That's a benefit.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.500
 So, do you ever fast longer than this?

32:31.500 --> 32:35.180
 It sounds like if you go to bed,

32:35.180 --> 32:36.780
 well, you tend to stay up late, I know,

32:36.780 --> 32:39.620
 because I get texts from you at like two in the morning,

32:40.580 --> 32:42.540
 my time, which means you're out very late

32:42.540 --> 32:43.820
 and up early as well.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.980
 But assuming that people go to sleep

32:45.980 --> 32:50.220
 sometime around 11, 30, or 12, plus or minus an hour,

32:50.220 --> 32:52.180
 and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.,

32:52.180 --> 32:54.220
 plus or minus 90 minutes,

32:55.900 --> 32:57.660
 you're eating more or less on a,

32:57.660 --> 33:00.940
 it sounds like some like 20 hours of fasting,

33:00.940 --> 33:03.220
 four hours of eating, or 16 hours of fasting,

33:03.220 --> 33:05.980
 eight hours of food intake, et cetera.

33:05.980 --> 33:07.860
 But do you ever do longer fasts,

33:07.860 --> 33:11.420
 like 48 hours or 72 hours or week-long fasts?

33:11.420 --> 33:12.540
 Occasionally I do.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.340
 So my typical day,

33:14.340 --> 33:16.340
 I would only eat within a two-hour window,

33:16.340 --> 33:18.860
 just usually I'm either eating out or-

33:18.860 --> 33:20.180
 So you're 22 too?

33:20.180 --> 33:23.060
 Yeah, yeah, but I love, well-

33:23.060 --> 33:24.980
 And if you exercise, do you feel like,

33:24.980 --> 33:27.820
 then you just power through and maintain that fasted state?

33:27.820 --> 33:29.260
 Absolutely, I can exercise.

33:29.260 --> 33:30.660
 And now my body's so used to it,

33:30.660 --> 33:32.780
 I don't feel like I need food after exercising.

33:32.780 --> 33:33.620
 I used to.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.460
 But have I gone longer?

33:36.460 --> 33:37.980
 Yes, but not very often.

33:37.980 --> 33:42.180
 I find it quite difficult to go more than 24 hours.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.900
 But when I do it, maybe it's once a month,

33:43.900 --> 33:45.220
 I'll go for two days.

33:46.220 --> 33:48.100
 After two, and actually even better,

33:48.100 --> 33:49.980
 if you go for three days without eating,

33:49.980 --> 33:54.980
 it kicks in even greater longevity benefits.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.780
 So there's a system called the autophagy system,

33:57.780 --> 34:01.620
 which digests old and misfolded proteins in the body.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.900
 And there's a natural cleansing

34:02.900 --> 34:04.820
 that happens when you're hungry.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.740
 Macro-autophagy, its name is.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.220
 But a good friend of mine, Anna Maria Cuervo

34:09.220 --> 34:11.140
 at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,

34:11.140 --> 34:14.300
 discovered a deep cleanse called the chaperone-mediated

34:14.300 --> 34:18.020
 autophagy, which kicks in day two, day three,

34:18.020 --> 34:21.620
 which really gets rid of the deep proteins.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.500
 And what excites me is she just put out a big paper

34:24.500 --> 34:28.860
 that said, if you trigger this process in an old mouse,

34:28.860 --> 34:31.140
 it lives 35% longer.

34:31.140 --> 34:31.980
 Wow.

34:31.980 --> 34:32.940
 Yeah, so it's a big deal.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.580
 If I could go longer, I would.

34:34.580 --> 34:36.420
 But I just find that with my lifestyle,

34:36.420 --> 34:41.220
 and I'm going always day 110%, I need to eat

34:41.220 --> 34:42.940
 at least once a day, unfortunately.

34:42.940 --> 34:44.100
 One more practical question

34:44.100 --> 34:46.060
 than a mechanistic question related to this.

34:46.060 --> 34:48.980
 The practical question is when you are fasting,

34:48.980 --> 34:50.460
 regardless of how long,

34:50.460 --> 34:52.500
 I know you're ingesting fluids like water

34:52.500 --> 34:54.260
 and presumably some caffeine.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.180
 I heard you had several or more espresso today,

34:59.620 --> 35:00.620
 which is impressive.

35:01.540 --> 35:04.820
 But are you also ingesting electrolytes?

35:04.820 --> 35:06.500
 Like I know some people get lightheaded,

35:06.500 --> 35:08.820
 they start to feel shaky when they fast,

35:08.820 --> 35:11.500
 and that the addition of sodium to their water

35:11.500 --> 35:14.220
 or potassium, magnesium is something

35:14.220 --> 35:16.060
 that's becoming a little more in vogue now.

35:16.060 --> 35:17.140
 Is that something that you do

35:17.140 --> 35:19.420
 or that you see a need for people to do?

35:19.420 --> 35:22.500
 Well, it makes sense, but I haven't had a need to do it.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.020
 So I don't, I just, I drink tea during the day

35:26.020 --> 35:29.500
 and coffee when I'm first awake and I don't get the shakes.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.820
 So, you know, I don't fix what's not broken.

35:31.820 --> 35:34.260
 And I do add things to my protocol

35:34.260 --> 35:36.180
 that I think will improve me

35:36.180 --> 35:38.620
 and avoid those things, of course, that won't.

35:39.620 --> 35:42.260
 But yeah, because I don't have a need for it, I don't try it.

35:42.260 --> 35:43.100
 But it does make sense,

35:43.100 --> 35:46.100
 especially if you've had a big night the night before,

35:46.100 --> 35:48.020
 you probably want to supplement with that.

35:48.020 --> 35:51.020
 But I think there's fair amount of good stuff

35:51.020 --> 35:53.380
 in tea and coffee as it is.

35:53.380 --> 35:56.340
 Okay, so then the mechanistic question is,

35:57.340 --> 35:59.900
 you've told us that there's ample evidence

35:59.900 --> 36:02.860
 that keeping your blood sugar low for a period of time,

36:02.860 --> 36:06.140
 each 24 hours, can help trigger some of these

36:06.140 --> 36:10.340
 pro-longevity anti-aging mechanisms

36:10.340 --> 36:12.940
 and that extending them out two or three days

36:12.940 --> 36:15.660
 can trigger yet additional mechanisms

36:15.660 --> 36:20.340
 of gobbling up of dead cells and things of that sort.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.780
 How is it that blood glucose triggers these mechanisms?

36:24.780 --> 36:25.620
 Because we've said, okay,

36:25.620 --> 36:28.140
 remove glucose and things get better.

36:28.140 --> 36:32.060
 You've talked before, maybe we could talk more now

36:32.060 --> 36:33.620
 about some of the underlying cellular

36:33.620 --> 36:36.020
 and genetic mechanisms, things like the sirtuins,

36:36.020 --> 36:37.900
 but how are glucose and the sirtuins

36:37.900 --> 36:40.860
 actually tethered to one another mechanistically?

36:40.860 --> 36:43.100
 Yeah, there's a really good question.

36:43.100 --> 36:47.220
 That proves you're a scientist or world leading on.

36:47.220 --> 36:51.420
 So what we now know is that these longevity pathways,

36:51.420 --> 36:54.140
 we call them, these longevity genes talk to each other.

36:54.140 --> 36:54.980
 And we used to say,

36:54.980 --> 36:56.780
 oh, my longevity gene's more important than yours.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.980
 It was ridiculous, because they're all talking to each other.

36:58.980 --> 37:01.420
 You pull one lever and the other one moves.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.420
 And the way to think of it is that there are systems set up

37:03.420 --> 37:05.340
 to detect what you're eating.

37:05.340 --> 37:10.340
 So the sirtuins will mainly respond to sugar and insulin.

37:10.780 --> 37:13.780
 And then there's this other system called mTOR,

37:13.780 --> 37:16.060
 which is sensing how much protein

37:16.060 --> 37:18.420
 or amino acids are coming into your body.

37:18.420 --> 37:19.340
 And they talk to each other.

37:19.340 --> 37:22.380
 We can pull one and affect the other and vice versa.

37:22.380 --> 37:24.380
 But together, when you're fasting,

37:24.380 --> 37:28.620
 you'll get the sirtuin activation, which is good for you.

37:28.620 --> 37:31.500
 And you'll also, through lack of amino acids,

37:31.500 --> 37:34.980
 particularly three of them, leucine, isoleucine, valine,

37:34.980 --> 37:37.220
 the body will downregulate mTOR.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.940
 And it's that up sirtuin, down mTOR

37:39.940 --> 37:41.260
 that is hugely beneficial

37:41.260 --> 37:44.180
 and turns on all of the body's defenses,

37:44.180 --> 37:46.340
 the chewing up the old proteins,

37:46.340 --> 37:49.020
 improving insulin sensitivity, giving us more energy,

37:49.020 --> 37:51.380
 repairing cells, all of that.

37:51.380 --> 37:52.660
 And so these two pathways,

37:52.660 --> 37:55.020
 I think are the most important for longevity.

37:55.020 --> 37:55.860
 So interesting.

37:55.860 --> 37:57.660
 You mentioned leucine.

37:57.660 --> 38:00.580
 Within the resistance training,

38:00.580 --> 38:02.700
 slash bodybuilding, slash fitness community,

38:02.700 --> 38:04.260
 leucine gets a lot of attention

38:04.260 --> 38:06.340
 because there are longstanding debates

38:06.340 --> 38:08.620
 about how much protein one needs per day

38:08.620 --> 38:10.500
 and how much one can assimilate at each meal.

38:10.500 --> 38:15.500
 It makes for many YouTube videos and not much else, frankly.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.780
 However, it's clear that because of leucine's effects

38:18.780 --> 38:22.340
 on the mTOR pathway, that there are many people,

38:22.340 --> 38:24.780
 not just people in these particular fitness communities

38:24.780 --> 38:28.020
 that are actively trying to ingest more leucine

38:28.020 --> 38:29.620
 on a regular basis

38:29.620 --> 38:33.180
 in order to maximize their wellness and fitness

38:33.180 --> 38:36.540
 and in some cases muscle growth, but also just wellness.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.500
 But what I interpret your last statement to mean

38:39.500 --> 38:42.780
 is that leucine, because it triggers cellular growth,

38:42.780 --> 38:46.340
 is actually pro-aging in some sense.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.820
 Is that right?

38:47.820 --> 38:48.900
 Well, it could be.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.260
 That's what the evidence suggests.

38:50.260 --> 38:53.100
 And again, it goes back to the debate, should you supplement

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100
 with growth hormone or testosterone,

38:56.380 --> 38:59.940
 all of these activities will give you immediate benefits.

38:59.940 --> 39:04.180
 You'll bulk up more, you'll feel better immediately.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.980
 But based on the research,

39:05.980 --> 39:08.380
 it's at the expense of long-term health.

39:08.380 --> 39:12.140
 So my view of longevity, the way I treat my body,

39:12.140 --> 39:14.980
 is I don't burn both candles.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.740
 I have one end of the candle lit.

39:16.740 --> 39:18.780
 I'm very careful, I don't blow on it.

39:18.780 --> 39:20.460
 But I also do enough exercise

39:20.460 --> 39:23.460
 that I'm building up my muscle, but I'm not huge.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.500
 Anyone who's seen me knows

39:25.500 --> 39:28.260
 that I'm not a professional bodybuilder.

39:28.260 --> 39:30.660
 But I tried to actually, here's the key,

39:30.660 --> 39:33.340
 and I haven't said this publicly that I can remember.

39:33.340 --> 39:36.620
 I pulse things so that I get periods of fasting

39:36.620 --> 39:39.420
 and then I eat, then I take a supplement,

39:40.420 --> 39:42.940
 then I fast, then I exercise.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.860
 And I'm taking the supplements and eating

39:45.860 --> 39:48.900
 in the right timing to allow me

39:48.900 --> 39:50.900
 to build up muscle sometimes.

39:50.900 --> 39:55.300
 Because you can't just expect to take something constantly

39:55.300 --> 39:57.540
 and do something constantly for it to work.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.620
 And that's why it's taken me about 15 years

39:59.620 --> 40:00.900
 to develop my protocol.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.860
 And there's a lot of subtlety to it.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.940
 Yeah, it sounds like a very rational protocol.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.740
 Does the name Ori Hofmeckler mean anything to you?

40:07.740 --> 40:08.580
 No.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.420
 Okay.

40:09.420 --> 40:12.300
 Just briefly, I discovered Ori Hofmeckler

40:12.300 --> 40:14.580
 about 15 years ago.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.780
 He was in Israeli special forces.

40:16.780 --> 40:19.060
 He's now got to be close to 70.

40:19.060 --> 40:22.140
 Forgive me, Ori, if that number is inflated.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.060
 He wrote a book called The Warrior Diet,

40:26.060 --> 40:28.300
 which got very little attention at the time.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.940
 But what he said was,

40:29.940 --> 40:31.820
 when he was in Israeli special forces,

40:31.820 --> 40:34.260
 they rarely ate more than once per day

40:34.260 --> 40:36.700
 and sometimes once every second or third day.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.420
 And this is a guy who maintains

40:38.420 --> 40:41.380
 an incredible physical stature.

40:41.380 --> 40:43.660
 You know, he's very lean, very strong,

40:43.660 --> 40:46.860
 and very vital at, you know,

40:46.860 --> 40:48.040
 I wouldn't say an advanced age,

40:48.040 --> 40:49.060
 but he's getting up there

40:49.060 --> 40:51.500
 and he just seems to be getting better and better.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.300
 Ori Hofmeckler was the person

40:53.300 --> 40:55.780
 who essentially founded, if you will,

40:55.780 --> 40:59.360
 although our ancestors founded, to be completely fair,

40:59.360 --> 41:03.420
 the so-called intermittent fasting diet.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.740
 He called it The Warrior Diet

41:04.740 --> 41:06.120
 and this book didn't get much attention.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.700
 But one of the things that you just said

41:08.700 --> 41:10.420
 really reminded me of Ori.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.260
 I sat down with him.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.860
 I actually went to his home and sat down with him

41:12.860 --> 41:15.260
 and he said, fasting is wonderful,

41:15.260 --> 41:18.140
 but these pulses where you nourish the body

41:18.140 --> 41:20.880
 or even slightly overnourish the body,

41:20.880 --> 41:23.180
 provided they aren't too frequent,

41:23.180 --> 41:25.940
 have a tremendous effect on vitality.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.120
 And so I want to use that as kind of a segue

41:28.120 --> 41:33.120
 to address this issue of vitality versus longevity,

41:33.140 --> 41:35.440
 because here you're telling me,

41:35.440 --> 41:38.620
 and certainly the evidence supports that, you know,

41:38.620 --> 41:40.580
 growth hormone will make you feel better and younger,

41:40.580 --> 41:43.100
 taking testosterone or estrogen, we should probably say.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.700
 There are, right,

41:44.700 --> 41:47.060
 women who take hormone therapies later in life

41:47.060 --> 41:47.940
 who take estrogen,

41:47.940 --> 41:50.540
 they experience a strong increase in vitality

41:50.540 --> 41:52.180
 if it's done correctly.

41:52.180 --> 41:56.480
 But there is an effect of aging the body more rapidly.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.380
 It's sort of a second puberty, if you will.

41:59.380 --> 42:02.620
 But this idea of restriction and then pulsing,

42:02.620 --> 42:04.680
 not necessarily feast and famine,

42:04.680 --> 42:08.700
 but certainly famine and feast in lowercase letters,

42:08.700 --> 42:10.980
 there really seems to be something about that.

42:10.980 --> 42:13.940
 So at a cellular level,

42:13.940 --> 42:16.940
 like we kind of go back to mTOR and the sirtuins,

42:16.940 --> 42:20.500
 how do you think that the cells might be reacting

42:20.500 --> 42:23.180
 to this kind of lowercase feast

42:24.060 --> 42:28.120
 and uppercase famine type protocol?

42:28.120 --> 42:28.960
 Right.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.620
 Well, the pulsing, I think,

42:32.620 --> 42:35.020
 is what you want to do is to get the cells

42:35.020 --> 42:39.260
 to be perceiving adversity, okay?

42:39.260 --> 42:41.160
 Because our modern life, we're sitting around,

42:41.160 --> 42:45.660
 we're eating too much, we're not exercising,

42:45.660 --> 42:47.040
 our cells respond.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.460
 They go, hey, everything's cool, no problem.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.020
 And they become relaxed

42:51.020 --> 42:53.220
 and they don't turn on their defenses and we age rapidly.

42:53.220 --> 42:54.640
 We can see it in the clock.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.740
 People who exercise and eat less

42:56.740 --> 42:58.260
 have a slower ticking clock.

42:58.260 --> 42:59.100
 It's a fact.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.440
 But my protocol is different than most people's

43:03.440 --> 43:05.500
 because I am pulsing it.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.240
 Now, first of all, let's get to why did I even think

43:08.240 --> 43:09.180
 that might be possible?

43:09.180 --> 43:11.880
 Because I didn't read the warrior diet.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.660
 What I found in my research was that

43:15.660 --> 43:18.220
 if we gave resveratrol, this red wine molecule

43:18.220 --> 43:20.840
 that became well-known in the 2000s,

43:22.100 --> 43:25.100
 if we gave it to mice, their whole lifespan,

43:25.100 --> 43:27.360
 they were protected against a high fat diet,

43:27.360 --> 43:29.000
 which we call the Western diet.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.820
 They had lean organs.

43:30.820 --> 43:33.820
 They lived slightly longer, but not a lot.

43:33.820 --> 43:37.860
 And if we gave them a high fat diet without resveratrol,

43:37.860 --> 43:40.500
 they actually lived a lot shorter.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.380
 So resveratrol protected them against the high fat diet.

43:43.380 --> 43:44.780
 We gave it to them on a normal diet.

43:44.780 --> 43:46.460
 They just ate it when they wanted

43:46.460 --> 43:48.500
 and there wasn't much effect.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.700
 This is what's not known,

43:49.700 --> 43:51.740
 though it's in the supplemental data of the paper

43:51.740 --> 43:53.100
 that nobody ever reads.

43:54.080 --> 43:57.020
 The mice that were given resveratrol every second day

43:57.020 --> 44:00.180
 on a normal diet lived dramatically longer

44:00.180 --> 44:01.360
 than any other group.

44:02.540 --> 44:05.100
 So people out there, you know, my critics say,

44:05.100 --> 44:06.900
 oh, resveratrol didn't extend the lifespan

44:06.900 --> 44:10.580
 of mice on a normal diet, therefore it's not aging.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.720
 It's just protecting against a high fat diet.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.200
 Well, look at the supplemental data, please.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.880
 If you give it to the mice every other day,

44:17.880 --> 44:19.940
 we had mice living over three years.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.620
 Wow, that's a long time.

44:21.620 --> 44:25.980
 I have got many, many mice in my ownership

44:25.980 --> 44:27.020
 in my lab at Stanford,

44:27.020 --> 44:29.500
 and that's a very long life for a mouse.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.540
 It was by far.

44:30.540 --> 44:33.900
 And so it was a long lifespan extension.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.980
 And what that told me is that probably

44:36.980 --> 44:40.300
 you don't want to be taking a supplement every day.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.120
 You can take it either every other day

44:42.120 --> 44:43.700
 or give your body a rest.

44:43.700 --> 44:45.460
 And I do the same with my meals.

44:45.460 --> 44:48.780
 I rest during the day and then I give a nutritious dinner

44:48.780 --> 44:50.860
 to my body and then give it a rest.

44:50.860 --> 44:51.940
 Same with exercise.

44:51.940 --> 44:54.100
 And then I try to time it because there are times

44:54.100 --> 44:56.460
 when I'm taking the drug metformin,

44:56.460 --> 45:00.120
 which mimics low energy. For those of you who don't know,

45:00.120 --> 45:02.300
 metformin is a drug given to type 2 diabetics

45:02.300 --> 45:04.400
 to bring down their blood sugar levels.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.540
 But it's been found that looking at tens of thousands

45:06.540 --> 45:08.420
 of veterans and others,

45:08.420 --> 45:10.900
 that those two type 2 diabetics live longer than people

45:10.900 --> 45:12.380
 that don't even get type 2 diabetes.

45:12.380 --> 45:14.900
 So it's a longevity drug.

45:14.900 --> 45:17.620
 Right now you have to get it from your doctor in the US

45:17.620 --> 45:18.820
 and most other countries,

45:18.820 --> 45:20.800
 you can just get it over the counter.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.740
 And you protect it, it looks like,

45:23.740 --> 45:28.700
 based on epidemiological data, cancer, heart disease,

45:28.700 --> 45:32.460
 frailty, what else, dementia.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.180
 So I take metformin.

45:35.180 --> 45:37.940
 You take metformin and your fasting each day.

45:37.940 --> 45:39.940
 So when do you take it relative to the fasting?

45:39.940 --> 45:44.020
 Yeah, I always take metformin in the morning,

45:44.020 --> 45:46.420
 along with the resveratrol,

45:46.420 --> 45:48.380
 because for a number of reasons,

45:48.380 --> 45:52.740
 but mainly because my body responds better

45:52.740 --> 45:55.400
 and I've been measuring my body for 12, 13 years.

45:56.420 --> 45:59.620
 But here's the thing, if I'm going to exercise that day,

45:59.620 --> 46:02.020
 I will skip the metformin.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.420
 And a lot of people who do pay attention

46:04.420 --> 46:06.180
 to this kind of thing,

46:06.180 --> 46:07.980
 think that they should stop taking metformin

46:07.980 --> 46:09.480
 because they're never going to get muscle

46:09.480 --> 46:12.320
 or it's going to affect their ability to build up muscle.

46:13.180 --> 46:14.340
 But that's not true.

46:15.260 --> 46:16.640
 What metformin does to you,

46:16.640 --> 46:20.540
 it actually just reduces your ability to have stamina

46:20.540 --> 46:22.300
 because it's inhibiting your body's ability

46:22.300 --> 46:23.180
 to make energy.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.700
 And so what happens is when you're on metformin,

46:26.700 --> 46:29.420
 you do fewer reps, but guess what?

46:29.420 --> 46:32.460
 Those muscles that you do build up on metformin

46:32.460 --> 46:35.080
 have the same strength and have much lower inflammation

46:35.080 --> 46:37.620
 and other markers of aging.

46:37.620 --> 46:41.900
 You just won't have that extra 5% size of muscles.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.800
 So if you want large muscles, don't take metformin

46:44.800 --> 46:48.020
 and you'll be fine during your exercise.

46:48.020 --> 46:50.740
 But for me, I'm not trying to get giant.

46:50.740 --> 46:52.860
 I want strong muscles and I want to live longer

46:52.860 --> 46:53.900
 and healthier.

46:53.900 --> 46:58.900
 So I just try to time it so that I get the most reps

46:59.100 --> 47:01.360
 out of my exercise regime.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.860
 But sometimes in scientific literature,

47:04.860 --> 47:06.740
 it's worth bringing this up.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.200
 If there's a 5% difference in a graph,

47:09.200 --> 47:13.540
 then either the press release or some reporter will say,

47:13.540 --> 47:15.020
 oh my goodness, big difference,

47:15.020 --> 47:17.840
 5% can't take metformin during exercise.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.020
 That's the headline.

47:19.020 --> 47:21.540
 And then you go in and it's barely significant.

47:21.540 --> 47:24.260
 And the graph is distorted because they've changed the axes

47:24.260 --> 47:25.960
 to make it look bigger.

47:25.960 --> 47:29.360
 And now it's become a myth that metformin

47:29.360 --> 47:31.260
 greatly inhibits your ability to exercise,

47:31.260 --> 47:32.780
 which is not true.

47:32.780 --> 47:34.220
 But in an abundance of caution,

47:34.220 --> 47:37.460
 I skip my metformin on days I'm going to exercise.

47:37.460 --> 47:39.580
 And not only that, I'm one of the 20% of people

47:39.580 --> 47:42.620
 that has a stomach sensitivity to it.

47:42.620 --> 47:44.340
 So if I'm not feeling great that day,

47:44.340 --> 47:45.540
 I don't take it either.

47:45.540 --> 47:48.140
 You mentioned metformin is available only by prescription

47:48.140 --> 47:50.660
 from a doctor, at least in the US.

47:50.660 --> 47:53.340
 Berberine, this is a substance that comes from tree bark,

47:53.340 --> 47:56.260
 who I also learned about many years ago from Ori.

47:57.220 --> 47:59.300
 He said, if ever I'm going to overeat

47:59.300 --> 48:02.620
 like a Thanksgiving meal or something, I take berberine.

48:02.620 --> 48:03.820
 Those were his words.

48:03.820 --> 48:04.660
 And I tried it.

48:04.660 --> 48:06.220
 And what's remarkable about berberine

48:06.220 --> 48:09.540
 is that you can eat enormous quantities of food

48:09.540 --> 48:12.380
 and not feel as if you've eaten enormous quantities of food.

48:12.380 --> 48:14.740
 I'm not necessarily recommending people do this,

48:14.740 --> 48:18.740
 but what I noticed was if I took berberine,

48:18.740 --> 48:21.180
 which my understanding is it works very similarly

48:21.180 --> 48:23.700
 to metformin, works on the AMPK pathway

48:23.700 --> 48:25.300
 and the mTOR pathway, et cetera,

48:26.220 --> 48:29.900
 that if I didn't ingest food in particular carbohydrates,

48:29.900 --> 48:32.060
 I would feel a little dizzy and kind of get a headache,

48:32.060 --> 48:34.280
 like almost hypoglycemic.

48:35.300 --> 48:36.560
 What are your thoughts on berberine

48:36.560 --> 48:38.860
 as an alternative to metformin?

48:38.860 --> 48:41.060
 And are there any cautionary notes?

48:41.060 --> 48:42.780
 I mean, obviously people should talk to their doctor

48:42.780 --> 48:45.140
 before adding or subtracting anything from their life,

48:45.140 --> 48:49.380
 including breath work or anything that comes up.

48:49.380 --> 48:52.020
 But with all that set aside,

48:52.020 --> 48:53.700
 what are your thoughts about berberine

48:53.700 --> 48:57.760
 and timing of low blood sugar and these sorts of things?

48:57.760 --> 48:58.600
 Right.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.460
 Well, before I had access to metformin,

49:00.460 --> 49:01.780
 I was taking berberine.

49:01.780 --> 49:04.180
 It's often known as the poor man's metformin.

49:05.260 --> 49:06.820
 He just called me poor.

49:06.820 --> 49:08.560
 Women can take it too.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.420
 So the thing with berberine, and we started it in my lab,

49:11.420 --> 49:15.080
 it is effective at boosting energetics in the body,

49:15.080 --> 49:18.080
 just like AMPK and metformin does.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.700
 And we've actually given it to rats and mice

49:21.700 --> 49:23.100
 and seen that they are very healthy,

49:23.100 --> 49:24.600
 especially on a high-fat diet.

49:25.540 --> 49:27.680
 So I think it's likely to be good.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.660
 There are some human studies that exist,

49:29.660 --> 49:31.420
 clinical trials showing that it increases

49:31.420 --> 49:32.380
 insulin sensitivity.

49:32.380 --> 49:33.460
 You have to take high doses.

49:33.460 --> 49:34.760
 Which is a good thing, right?

49:34.760 --> 49:35.600
 Yeah.

49:35.600 --> 49:36.740
 I think when people hear insulin sensitivity,

49:36.740 --> 49:39.140
 sometimes people think, oh, well, that's bad, right?

49:39.140 --> 49:41.220
 No, but you want your cells to be insulin sensitive.

49:41.220 --> 49:43.500
 You don't want a lot of blood sugar floating around

49:43.500 --> 49:45.520
 that can't be sequestered into cells.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.360
 Exactly.

49:46.360 --> 49:49.220
 So this is anti-type 2 diabetes.

49:49.220 --> 49:52.940
 And so this berberine does have wonderful effects

49:52.940 --> 49:56.520
 on the metabolism of animals and in some clinical trials

49:56.520 --> 49:58.500
 on dozens of people it's been tested.

49:58.500 --> 50:01.940
 Now there's one cautionary tale, which just came up.

50:01.940 --> 50:04.500
 Matt Kaeberlein's lab published that berberine

50:04.500 --> 50:06.140
 reduced the lifespan of worms.

50:07.380 --> 50:10.240
 But I'm not sure worms trump human clinical trials

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
 at this point.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.080
 So I would say-

50:12.080 --> 50:12.900
 Not in my opinion.

50:12.900 --> 50:15.300
 But no disrespect to my C. elegans colleagues,

50:15.300 --> 50:17.340
 or rather my colleagues that work on C. elegans.

50:17.340 --> 50:18.180
 Yeah.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.220
 Well, what I like to do is to give all the information

50:20.220 --> 50:21.980
 people can decide what they want.

50:21.980 --> 50:24.260
 But I would say if, based on the worm data,

50:24.260 --> 50:25.980
 I wouldn't panic just yet.

50:25.980 --> 50:27.220
 I think berberine has been shown

50:27.220 --> 50:29.440
 to be really safe in humans.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.020
 You mentioned resveratrol.

50:31.020 --> 50:33.240
 I think now would be a great time to talk a little bit

50:33.240 --> 50:35.020
 about protocols for resveratrol,

50:35.020 --> 50:37.380
 grape seed extract, et cetera.

50:37.380 --> 50:38.980
 Let's start with the obvious one

50:38.980 --> 50:40.220
 that I know you get a lot.

50:40.220 --> 50:45.060
 But for the record, can't I just drink red wine

50:45.060 --> 50:47.980
 and get enough resveratrol, David?

50:47.980 --> 50:48.860
 You can try.

50:48.860 --> 50:51.580
 You need to drink about 200 glasses a day.

50:51.580 --> 50:52.420
 So I-

50:52.420 --> 50:54.060
 I'm sure it's been tried.

50:54.060 --> 50:55.500
 There are some.

50:55.500 --> 51:00.020
 And I drink a glass of red wine a day if I get the chance.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.220
 But any more than that, it's a lot of calories

51:02.220 --> 51:04.140
 and your liver will get fatty and it's all bad.

51:04.140 --> 51:08.180
 So realistically, you can only get the thousand milligrams

51:08.180 --> 51:13.180
 that I take a day from a supplement that's pure.

51:13.260 --> 51:14.900
 Now, there are a lot of people selling resveratrol.

51:14.900 --> 51:19.060
 If it's not light gray or white in color, throw it away.

51:19.060 --> 51:22.980
 The brown stuff has gone bad or is contaminated.

51:22.980 --> 51:26.460
 And the contaminated stuff, beware, it'll cause diarrhea.

51:26.460 --> 51:28.660
 But regular resveratrol should not do that.

51:28.660 --> 51:31.460
 So a thousand milligrams per day is what you do?

51:31.460 --> 51:34.800
 Yeah, and I have for about 15 years now.

51:34.800 --> 51:38.380
 And you ingest that with some fatty substance

51:38.380 --> 51:40.740
 like olive oil or yogurt, is that right?

51:40.740 --> 51:41.580
 Yeah, you have to.

51:41.580 --> 51:44.940
 And other supplements, quercetin, curcumin,

51:44.940 --> 51:46.260
 these are crunchy things.

51:46.260 --> 51:48.020
 They're not going to get through your gut.

51:48.020 --> 51:49.540
 And I'm not just making this up.

51:49.540 --> 51:53.040
 I always base my statements on human studies.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.380
 So we've done a lot of studies on resveratrol

51:55.380 --> 51:56.780
 as have others since.

51:56.780 --> 51:59.360
 And we know that from, we found out early,

51:59.360 --> 52:00.980
 I was one of the first people to take a high dose

52:00.980 --> 52:02.380
 for resveratrol.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.680
 And when we included it with food,

52:04.680 --> 52:07.500
 the levels in my blood went up fivefold.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.140
 And so you want to have something in there.

52:09.140 --> 52:10.120
 If you just drink it with water,

52:10.120 --> 52:11.680
 it's not going to get through.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.980
 And unfortunately, some people have done clinical trials

52:13.980 --> 52:16.020
 without even thinking that they might need

52:16.020 --> 52:17.820
 to dissolve it in something.

52:17.820 --> 52:20.260
 So are you taking this all at once in the morning

52:20.260 --> 52:21.820
 and chasing it with some olive oil?

52:21.820 --> 52:24.620
 Or are you dissolving it in yogurt?

52:24.620 --> 52:26.580
 What's the specific protocol?

52:26.580 --> 52:31.580
 Yeah, I've been improving, perfecting what I do.

52:31.580 --> 52:34.740
 For about 10 years, I would take some Greek yogurt,

52:34.740 --> 52:37.580
 a couple of spoonfuls, put the resveratrol on there,

52:37.580 --> 52:39.460
 mix it around, make sure it's dissolved,

52:39.460 --> 52:41.540
 and put that in my mouth and swallow that.

52:41.540 --> 52:42.740
 These days, what I like to do,

52:42.740 --> 52:45.500
 because I've realized that olive oil,

52:45.500 --> 52:47.620
 and particularly oleic acid,

52:47.620 --> 52:50.220
 one of the monounsaturated fatty acids,

52:50.220 --> 52:53.860
 is also an activator of the sirtuin defenses.

52:53.860 --> 52:56.940
 So I'm trying to ingest more oleic acid.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.580
 So I switched to olive oil.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.780
 What I do is I put a couple of teaspoons of olive oil

53:00.780 --> 53:04.100
 in a glass, mix around the resveratrol,

53:04.100 --> 53:07.100
 and maybe some quercetin, a similar molecule,

53:07.100 --> 53:08.900
 make sure it's dissolved.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.460
 I put a little bit of vinegar,

53:11.340 --> 53:14.240
 and if I have a basil leaf, I'll put that in,

53:14.240 --> 53:17.260
 and it's like drinking some salad dressing, and it's great.

53:17.260 --> 53:18.100
 Delicious.

53:19.900 --> 53:22.780
 That raises a question that I want to ask

53:22.780 --> 53:27.780
 before we get to NMN and NR and vitamin B3,

53:27.780 --> 53:31.020
 which is, by doing that,

53:31.020 --> 53:33.260
 do you think that it breaks your fast?

53:33.260 --> 53:36.420
 And I want to just frame this question of breaking the fast

53:36.420 --> 53:38.660
 in a more general scientific theme,

53:38.660 --> 53:41.020
 and I'd love your thoughts on this.

53:41.020 --> 53:43.340
 One of the questions I get asked all the time is,

53:43.340 --> 53:46.140
 does ingesting blank break the fast?

53:46.140 --> 53:49.300
 Does eating this or drinking this, coffee,

53:49.300 --> 53:51.580
 if I walk in the room and someone else is eating a cracker,

53:51.580 --> 53:53.380
 does it break my fast?

53:53.380 --> 53:54.980
 People get pretty extreme with this.

53:54.980 --> 53:57.940
 My sense, and please tell me if I'm wrong,

53:57.940 --> 54:00.580
 but my sense is that it depends on the context

54:00.580 --> 54:02.180
 of what you did the night before,

54:02.180 --> 54:04.820
 whether or not you're diabetic, lots of things.

54:04.820 --> 54:07.940
 So for instance, if I eat an enormous meal at midnight,

54:07.940 --> 54:11.260
 go to sleep, wake up at 6 a.m.,

54:11.260 --> 54:14.260
 I could imagine that black coffee

54:14.260 --> 54:15.700
 or coffee with a little bit of cream

54:15.700 --> 54:17.660
 might quote unquote break my fast,

54:17.660 --> 54:20.140
 but the body doesn't have a breaking the fast switch.

54:20.140 --> 54:22.540
 The body only speaks in the language of glucose,

54:22.540 --> 54:24.820
 AMPK, mTOR, et cetera.

54:24.820 --> 54:28.580
 So do you worry that ingesting these calories

54:28.580 --> 54:30.260
 is going to quote unquote break your fast?

54:30.260 --> 54:33.140
 And more generally, how do you think about the issue

54:33.140 --> 54:34.860
 of whether or not you're fasting enough

54:34.860 --> 54:36.620
 to get these positive effects?

54:36.620 --> 54:41.620
 Because not everybody can manage on just water or just tea,

54:41.700 --> 54:44.620
 or we should say not everybody is willing to manage

54:44.620 --> 54:47.420
 on just water or just tea for a certain part of the day.

54:47.420 --> 54:50.740
 Well, my first answer is not scientific, it's philosophical.

54:50.740 --> 54:53.300
 If you don't enjoy life, what's the point?

54:53.300 --> 54:56.260
 And so I'd like a cup of coffee in the morning,

54:56.260 --> 54:59.780
 little bit of milk, spoonful of yogurt's not gonna kill me.

55:00.780 --> 55:04.260
 Olive oil doesn't have protein or carbs in it, not many.

55:04.260 --> 55:05.780
 And so I'm probably not affecting

55:05.780 --> 55:07.940
 those longevity pathways negatively.

55:09.460 --> 55:11.580
 But without that, first of all,

55:11.580 --> 55:13.100
 I wouldn't enjoy my life as much.

55:13.100 --> 55:15.220
 Well, the olive oil is not as great as the yogurt,

55:15.220 --> 55:18.020
 but I'm trying to optimize.

55:18.020 --> 55:21.660
 And there's no perfect solution to what we're doing.

55:21.660 --> 55:22.700
 And we're still learning.

55:22.700 --> 55:24.780
 We don't know what's optimal for me,

55:24.780 --> 55:26.500
 let alone everybody else.

55:26.500 --> 55:29.180
 But I'm with you, I don't believe that taking

55:29.180 --> 55:30.700
 a couple of spoonfuls of something

55:30.700 --> 55:34.340
 unless it's high fructose corn syrup is gonna hurt you

55:34.340 --> 55:36.060
 because I've now got the rest of the day

55:36.060 --> 55:39.420
 till about eight, nine p.m. of not eating anything.

55:39.420 --> 55:42.580
 And I forgive myself for that.

55:42.580 --> 55:44.540
 And there's a really good point here.

55:44.540 --> 55:46.500
 You and I were discussing this earlier.

55:46.500 --> 55:51.500
 The point about doing this is that you try to do your best.

55:52.500 --> 55:56.940
 If you go from regular living to don't eat the whole day,

55:56.940 --> 56:00.020
 you're gonna fail, like quitting smoking cold turkey.

56:00.020 --> 56:02.500
 It's easier to chew gum and stick the patch on

56:02.500 --> 56:04.860
 because your body has to get used to all sorts of habits.

56:04.860 --> 56:06.540
 And it's social, it's physical,

56:06.540 --> 56:08.380
 putting stuff in your mouth, chewing,

56:08.380 --> 56:10.380
 not just the low blood sugar levels.

56:10.380 --> 56:11.860
 And your brain will fight it.

56:11.860 --> 56:15.140
 Your limbic system is gonna go, hey, do it, do it, do it.

56:15.140 --> 56:17.340
 And you're gonna have to fight it.

56:17.340 --> 56:19.620
 But once you get through it, you'll be better.

56:19.620 --> 56:21.780
 But you do it in stages.

56:21.780 --> 56:24.940
 Do breakfast first, then do small lunch,

56:24.940 --> 56:26.660
 and then eventually cut lunch out.

56:26.660 --> 56:29.300
 Don't go cold turkey because everyone knows

56:29.300 --> 56:32.580
 it's a fact that if you try to do a strict diet

56:32.580 --> 56:35.260
 right out of the gates, you'll almost always fail.

56:36.180 --> 56:41.180
 No, I think that captures the essence of fasting rationally

56:41.180 --> 56:44.820
 and a rational approach to supplementation very well.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.820
 Along the lines of supplementation,

56:47.820 --> 56:52.560
 what about NMN, NR, and B3 niacin?

56:55.820 --> 56:57.380
 I want to know what you do.

56:57.380 --> 56:59.640
 I also want to know what I should do.

56:59.640 --> 57:02.620
 And I think most people want to know what they should do.

57:02.620 --> 57:05.820
 I mean, these are molecules that impact the sirtuin pathway,

57:05.820 --> 57:08.860
 impact the pathways that control aging

57:08.860 --> 57:11.540
 or rates of aging in the epigenome.

57:11.540 --> 57:12.880
 How do they do that?

57:12.880 --> 57:14.540
 And how does one incorporate that

57:14.540 --> 57:16.940
 into a supplementation protocol,

57:16.940 --> 57:18.160
 should they choose to do that?

57:18.160 --> 57:19.260
 All right.

57:19.260 --> 57:21.540
 Well, disclaimer is that I don't recommend anything,

57:21.540 --> 57:22.940
 but I talk about what I do.

57:23.980 --> 57:25.160
 So a bit of scientific background.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.780
 These sirtuin genes that we discovered,

57:26.780 --> 57:29.160
 first in yeast cells when I was at MIT,

57:29.160 --> 57:33.340
 and then in animals as I moved to Harvard in the 2000s.

57:33.340 --> 57:35.380
 And one of my first postdocs,

57:35.380 --> 57:37.740
 actually literally my first postdoc, Chaim Cohen,

57:37.740 --> 57:41.260
 published a great paper just a couple of months ago

57:41.260 --> 57:44.940
 and found that turning on the sirtuin 6 gene,

57:44.940 --> 57:47.700
 remember the 7, number 6 gene is very potent.

57:47.700 --> 57:50.020
 It extended the lifespan dramatically of mice

57:50.020 --> 57:53.180
 that he engineered, both males and females, which is great.

57:53.180 --> 57:55.300
 So what you want to do is,

57:55.300 --> 57:58.580
 so naturally boost the activity of these sirtuins.

57:58.580 --> 58:00.580
 They are genes, but they also make proteins.

58:00.580 --> 58:03.460
 That's what genes typically make or encode.

58:03.460 --> 58:04.960
 And then those proteins take care of the body

58:04.960 --> 58:07.380
 in many different ways, as we've discussed.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.100
 So how do you turn on these genes

58:09.100 --> 58:11.580
 and make the proteins they make even more active?

58:11.580 --> 58:12.600
 You want to rev up that system.

58:12.600 --> 58:16.540
 So exercise will do it, fasting will do it.

58:16.540 --> 58:17.780
 What about supplementation?

58:17.780 --> 58:20.020
 Well, the first activator of the sirtuins

58:20.020 --> 58:22.560
 that we discovered that acts on the enzyme

58:22.560 --> 58:24.820
 to make it do a better job of cleaning up the body

58:24.820 --> 58:27.500
 and protecting was resveratrol.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.300
 We looked at thousands of different molecules,

58:30.300 --> 58:32.020
 eventually tens of thousands.

58:32.020 --> 58:35.820
 And the one that was the best was resveratrol in the dish.

58:35.820 --> 58:38.340
 And then we gave it to little organisms, worms,

58:38.340 --> 58:41.860
 and then flies and mice, eventually humans.

58:41.860 --> 58:44.060
 And we saw that it activated that enzyme.

58:44.060 --> 58:46.540
 So resveratrol is one way to activate it.

58:46.540 --> 58:49.340
 You can think of it as the accelerator pedal on a car.

58:49.340 --> 58:52.380
 It revs it up, but there's something else

58:52.380 --> 58:56.140
 that the sirtuins need to work, and that's NAD.

58:56.140 --> 58:57.900
 NAD is a really small molecule,

58:57.900 --> 59:00.620
 a little chemical in the body that we need for life.

59:00.620 --> 59:03.340
 It's used by the body for chemical reactions,

59:03.340 --> 59:04.900
 400 different reactions in the body,

59:04.900 --> 59:07.320
 and without it, you're dead within seconds.

59:08.380 --> 59:09.220
 You need NAD.

59:09.220 --> 59:13.060
 The problem that we've seen is that NAD levels decline

59:13.060 --> 59:16.960
 as you become obese, as you get older,

59:16.960 --> 59:19.380
 if you don't ever get hungry.

59:19.380 --> 59:22.700
 And the body not only doesn't make enough of it,

59:22.700 --> 59:23.940
 it's chewing it up as well.

59:23.940 --> 59:28.940
 There's an enzyme called CD38 that Eric Verdin over at UCSF

59:29.800 --> 59:32.220
 showed chews up, oh, he's now at the Buck Institute

59:32.220 --> 59:34.700
 in California, chews up NAD.

59:34.700 --> 59:36.340
 As you get older, so it's a double whammy.

59:36.340 --> 59:38.500
 You don't make as much, you chew it up,

59:38.500 --> 59:40.520
 which is really bad because what we've shown in my lab

59:40.520 --> 59:43.260
 and so have others is that NAD levels are really important

59:43.260 --> 59:47.220
 for keeping those sirtuin defenses at a youthful level.

59:47.220 --> 59:48.780
 And you can give a lot of resveratrol,

59:48.780 --> 59:50.360
 but if you don't have the fuel,

59:50.360 --> 59:52.500
 you're basically accelerating a car

59:52.500 --> 59:54.180
 that doesn't have enough gas.

59:54.180 --> 59:55.740
 So you wanna do both, and that's what I do.

59:55.740 --> 1:00:00.180
 I take a precursor to NAD called NMN,

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:05.140
 and the body uses that to make the NAD molecule in one step.

1:00:05.140 --> 1:00:09.340
 And so I know from measuring dozens of human beings

1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:13.500
 that if you take NMN for the time period that I do,

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:14.400
 I've been taking it for years,

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:16.300
 but if you take it for about two weeks,

1:00:16.300 --> 1:00:18.160
 you will double, on average,

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:20.840
 double your NAD levels in the blood, okay?

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:22.140
 That's not public information.

1:00:22.140 --> 1:00:24.800
 That's from clinical trials that are not yet published

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:26.660
 over the last two years.

1:00:26.660 --> 1:00:29.160
 There are other ways to increase NAD levels

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:31.980
 in someone like me who's getting older, I'm 52 now.

1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:36.740
 You can take NR, which is used to make NMN,

1:00:36.740 --> 1:00:39.500
 which is used to make NAD.

1:00:39.500 --> 1:00:44.420
 And both NMN and NR are sold by companies in the U.S.

1:00:45.340 --> 1:00:49.440
 NR lacks the phosphate.

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.060
 Phosphate's a small chemical that the body needs.

1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:54.300
 You've probably heard of the atom phosphorus.

1:00:56.460 --> 1:00:57.980
 Let's go back one step.

1:00:57.980 --> 1:00:59.260
 How do you make NR?

1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:02.680
 NR gets made from vitamin B3 often.

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:05.740
 You can also find it in milk and other foods.

1:01:05.740 --> 1:01:06.860
 But sometimes people ask me,

1:01:06.860 --> 1:01:08.540
 why don't you just take vitamin B3

1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:12.060
 and won't that just force the body to make NAD?

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:14.820
 And the answer is no, it doesn't work very well.

1:01:14.820 --> 1:01:17.860
 We know this just by doing the experiment.

1:01:17.860 --> 1:01:21.520
 But the reason I think is, is that NAD is a,

1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:22.660
 I said it's a small molecule,

1:01:22.660 --> 1:01:25.540
 but relative to vitamin B3, it's big.

1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:27.540
 It's got those phosphates on there.

1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:28.820
 It's got a sugar.

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:33.420
 It's got the vitamin B attached.

1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:35.660
 So you've got all these components that come together

1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:40.140
 to make this very complicated little molecule called NAD.

1:01:40.140 --> 1:01:43.540
 And when you give NMN, it contains all three components

1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:45.620
 that the body needs to make NAD.

1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:48.340
 If you give NR, or just vitamin B3,

1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:50.080
 which is an even smaller molecule,

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:51.840
 the body has to find these other components

1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:53.140
 from somewhere else.

1:01:53.140 --> 1:01:55.140
 So where do you get phosphate?

1:01:55.140 --> 1:01:58.520
 Well, body needs it for DNA, needs it for bones.

1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:00.900
 So high doses of something

1:02:00.900 --> 1:02:03.500
 that requires additional phosphate

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:05.460
 makes me a little concerned.

1:02:05.460 --> 1:02:07.820
 And we have compared NMN and NR head-to-head

1:02:07.820 --> 1:02:09.660
 in mouse studies.

1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:12.540
 For instance, NMN we've shown in a cell paper

1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:14.740
 a few years ago, makes mice run further.

1:02:14.740 --> 1:02:16.260
 Old mice can run 50% further

1:02:16.260 --> 1:02:18.220
 because they had better blood flow, better energy.

1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:20.020
 NR at the same dose did not do that.

1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:21.300
 In fact, it had no effect.

1:02:21.300 --> 1:02:26.300
 I see, dosage-wise, if I were elect to take NMN

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:29.920
 in supplement form to increase my NAD levels

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:32.500
 and presumably slow my aging,

1:02:33.780 --> 1:02:35.240
 how much NMN should I take?

1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:37.680
 What's the protocol that you do?

1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:42.100
 And are the various forms that are out there,

1:02:42.100 --> 1:02:43.720
 are some better or some worse?

1:02:45.660 --> 1:02:47.580
 Well, I'm always happy to tell you what I do

1:02:47.580 --> 1:02:50.060
 and what my father does, my 82-year-old father.

1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:52.980
 We take a gram of NMN every day.

1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:56.020
 So it's a gram of resveratrol and a gram of NMN.

1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:56.860
 Right.

1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:58.020
 Okay, 1,000 milligrams.

1:02:58.020 --> 1:03:02.020
 Now, another important point,

1:03:02.020 --> 1:03:04.880
 which is I'm not the same as everybody else.

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.380
 I have a different microbiome, age, sex, right?

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:10.420
 And so I've been measuring myself.

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:12.500
 And so I know if something's,

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:14.700
 or I think I know if something's making me better or worse

1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:17.900
 based on measuring 45 different things.

1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:20.580
 So I just want people to be aware

1:03:20.580 --> 1:03:25.060
 that what I do may not perfectly work at all for others.

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:26.820
 But I have studied, as I said,

1:03:26.820 --> 1:03:31.220
 dozens of people who take NMN at a gram,

1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:32.280
 sometimes two grams.

1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:34.860
 And I know by looking at all those people

1:03:34.860 --> 1:03:36.900
 that without any exceptions,

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:37.780
 that if you do what I do,

1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:42.020
 your NAD levels go up by about twofold or more.

1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:44.480
 And so I do that every day, the 1,000 milligrams.

1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:45.820
 Now, people sell it.

1:03:45.820 --> 1:03:48.220
 Now, I never get into brands and all that.

1:03:48.220 --> 1:03:52.100
 First of all, I don't have the time to measure products.

1:03:52.100 --> 1:03:54.220
 I don't know, though I should say,

1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:57.020
 I do want to say I'm working on a solution

1:03:57.020 --> 1:03:59.300
 for people to know what works

1:03:59.300 --> 1:04:02.340
 and what's real and what isn't, but I'm not there yet.

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:04.340
 And in the meantime, I would say,

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:06.540
 if you do want to buy this,

1:04:06.540 --> 1:04:08.120
 let's say you want to buy NMN,

1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:10.760
 look for a company that is well-established,

1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:13.900
 that has high levels of quality control.

1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:16.260
 Look for three letters, GMP,

1:04:16.260 --> 1:04:19.140
 which is good manufacturing practices.

1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:20.260
 And so that means they make it

1:04:20.260 --> 1:04:22.280
 under a certain level of quality control.

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:25.500
 You're not going to find iron filings in there,

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:29.060
 and it probably has the stuff in it that they say it does.

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:32.600
 So that's all I can say right now.

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.960
 I'm working on something that's going to be much more helpful.

1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:39.580
 But overall, make sure it's white, crystalline, NMN,

1:04:39.580 --> 1:04:42.460
 and that to me, it tastes like burnt popcorn.

1:04:42.460 --> 1:04:44.920
 You crack open the capsules and you'll take a little sample

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:46.780
 to make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn.

1:04:46.780 --> 1:04:50.460
 Well, when I'm making my capsules, I'll taste it.

1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:53.540
 And I do a lot of quality control on the stuff that I take.

1:04:53.540 --> 1:04:56.060
 Do you take that gram all at once with the resveratrol

1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:58.580
 or do you take it spread throughout the day?

1:04:58.580 --> 1:05:01.540
 It's all in the morning for those things.

1:05:01.540 --> 1:05:04.820
 So if I take metformin, it's NMN

1:05:04.820 --> 1:05:06.620
 and the resveratrol all together.

1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:08.380
 And there's a good reason for that.

1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:10.400
 It's all scientific, I try to be.

1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:13.800
 The levels of NAD go up in the morning

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:14.720
 in our bodies naturally.

1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:17.240
 Our bodies actually have a cycle of NAD, it's not steady.

1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:18.080
 It's circadian.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:18.900
 It's circadian.

1:05:18.900 --> 1:05:22.240
 In fact, NAD controls your clock.

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.240
 This was shown by Shin, MI, and colleagues

1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:27.080
 in a nice science paper about a decade ago

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:28.880
 that if you disrupt the NAD cycle,

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:33.000
 which is controlled by the sirtuin gene that we worked on,

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.840
 that is what's telling your body, oh, it's time to eat,

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:37.320
 it's time to go to sleep.

1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:40.220
 And if you take the NMN late at night,

1:05:40.220 --> 1:05:43.320
 for example, you can disrupt your circadian rhythms.

1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:44.160
 Interesting.

1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:47.200
 Conversely, when I travel and I want to reset my clock

1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:52.200
 to the time zone, I will take a boost of NMN in the morning

1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:53.880
 and I feel great.

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:56.520
 Does this protocol for you,

1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:00.160
 does it produce any immediate effects

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:01.920
 of increased energy, et cetera?

1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:05.840
 You mentioned that one would, if it's right for them,

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:08.200
 would have to take it for at least two weeks

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:10.120
 to start to see the NAD levels increase.

1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:13.560
 At that point, when NAD levels increase,

1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:16.020
 could one possibly expect an increase

1:06:16.020 --> 1:06:19.640
 in overall energy focus, et cetera?

1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:21.980
 I realize we're not making promises here,

1:06:21.980 --> 1:06:24.040
 but I'm just wondering whether or not the only measure

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:25.860
 of whether or not this protocol is working

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:30.860
 is whether or not you die at age blank or blank plus 20.

1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:33.840
 And of course, once you're dead,

1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:36.520
 you can't really know if you would have lived longer

1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:38.560
 if you'd done something differently and vice versa.

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:41.200
 Sure, well, there was a study, again, by Shina Mai,

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.880
 my good friend at Washington University in St. Louis,

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.640
 that showed that it improves,

1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:50.440
 remember, this insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing.

1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:52.120
 But you can't know your insulin sensitivity

1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:53.800
 unless you're measuring a glucose,

1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:55.120
 have a glucose monitor on your arm.

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:56.320
 Do you have one on right now?

1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:57.720
 No.

1:06:57.720 --> 1:06:58.700
 No, I used to.

1:06:58.700 --> 1:06:59.540
 I learned a lot.

1:06:59.540 --> 1:07:01.040
 Yeah, last time I saw you had this thing.

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:04.200
 It looks like a small leech, not a large leech,

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:06.200
 and it was measuring your blood glucose.

1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:07.320
 They're very informative

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:09.480
 because you learn what your body reacts to,

1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:11.360
 and grapes were really bad.

1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:14.080
 Rhonda Patrick agrees with that.

1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:19.080
 But the issue was what, where were we, Andrew?

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:20.560
 The issue is whether or not

1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:22.840
 you can expect any immediate effects

1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:26.480
 on energy, vitality, focus, just even subjective.

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:28.040
 So what do you feel is the question?

1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:29.640
 And anecdotally,

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:31.000
 because I've been taking this for a long time,

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.120
 if I don't take it, I start to feel 50 years old.

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:33.960
 It's horrible.

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:35.760
 I can't think straight.

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:38.840
 It may be placebo, but who knows?

1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:41.480
 But what we're doing now are very careful clinical trials.

1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:43.320
 We've done the safety for two years,

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:45.680
 and we're now treating elderly patients

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:49.080
 at Harvard Medical School with some wonderful colleagues.

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.360
 And those people are actually going to be,

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:53.720
 and currently in MRIs,

1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:57.600
 so you can measure the energetics and the NAD levels

1:07:57.600 --> 1:08:00.800
 in their legs as they exercise in real time.

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.400
 And that will tell us if what we see in the mice,

1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:05.800
 this increased endurance, actually works.

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:07.840
 In the meantime, it's fun to talk about anecdotes.

1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.480
 I have a number of athlete friends,

1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:12.680
 some of which have increased their,

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.800
 lowered their time in marathons, for example.

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:18.840
 There's a good friend of ours in our circle

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:21.800
 that is winning marathons at age 50 now.

1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:24.560
 And he attributes that to the protocol that he's on.

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:25.400
 Interesting.

1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:26.840
 I haven't started taking NMN,

1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:30.080
 but I'm planning to do that when my next birthday arrives,

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:31.360
 which is in a couple of months.

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:34.240
 But I do experiments on my sister and have for years,

1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:37.280
 I have a sister who's three years older than I am,

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:40.120
 who is very enthusiastic about these protocols.

1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:43.040
 And I'll tell you that after reading your book,

1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:44.960
 I started purchasing for her

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:47.160
 and giving her an NMN supplement.

1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:50.120
 And she claims, and I believe her,

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.600
 she has a quite sensitive system

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:52.920
 and she's very tuned into it.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:56.360
 She feels far and away better when she takes it

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.680
 as opposed to when she doesn't.

1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:01.200
 And I've done the control experiment of removing her supply

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.360
 and then giving it back to her and this kind of thing.

1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:06.000
 So that's my other laboratory.

1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:10.120
 This is what younger brothers do to older sisters.

1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:11.560
 I have a question about something that,

1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:12.600
 if it has no relevance,

1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:16.080
 we can just treat it as a speed bump and then move right on.

1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:18.800
 And the artificial sweeteners, these things that,

1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:23.040
 or I should say non-glucose increasing sweeteners.

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:26.080
 So you've got stevia, which is a plant basically,

1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:29.120
 and then you've got sucralose and aspartame

1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:30.040
 and all these things.

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:33.320
 There is some evidence that I know we're both aware of,

1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:35.400
 they've been published in quite reputable journals

1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:38.680
 showing that they can disrupt the gut microbiome

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:40.600
 in certain cases, in particular saccharin,

1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:42.840
 the one that basically nobody uses anymore.

1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:45.480
 And it's questionable as to whether or not stevia

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:47.040
 has the same negative effects, et cetera.

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:48.160
 That's not what this is about.

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:51.880
 But in terms of the sensation of,

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:54.720
 or the perception of sweet taste,

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.720
 is that itself a possible detriment to these pro-longevity,

1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:04.120
 forgive me for using the term, the pathways.

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.040
 If I were to drink a Diet Coke during a fast,

1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:08.480
 am I somehow disrupting this?

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:09.360
 And I'm asking this question

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:11.480
 because I get asked this question a lot.

1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:13.640
 Well, there may be small effects.

1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:16.360
 I don't think they're worth worrying about.

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:17.760
 Joe Rogan laughed at me

1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:18.960
 because I was drinking a Diet Coke

1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:21.320
 during the first interview I did with him.

1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:23.160
 I will drink Diet Coke.

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:24.840
 I've read the scientific literature.

1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:26.600
 And again, it's this 5% thing

1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:29.120
 that I think is blown out of proportion.

1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.000
 If I was to put a number on it,

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000
 I would say if eating a high sugary meal

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.800
 or drinking a sugar-filled soda,

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:42.080
 what is that, 30 grams of sugar,

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:45.760
 let's say that's a 10 out of 10 bad for you.

1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:47.720
 A Diet Coke might be a one.

1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:50.760
 And if I'm, you know, which am I gonna do?

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:53.960
 I could have a 10 or a one or go without in my life.

1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:56.000
 I'll do the one on occasion.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.600
 I try to avoid them because I don't like the ones as much.

1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:02.200
 But you can't say that sucralose

1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:05.120
 is equivalent to drinking a sugary soda.

1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:07.200
 There's just no comparison.

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:09.480
 And I think, what is it, stevia.

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:11.120
 I do use stevia whenever I can

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:14.920
 because it's a naturally sourced product.

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:16.760
 And I haven't seen any good evidence yet

1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:18.520
 that it's bad for you.

1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:20.800
 But I think a lot of this is overblown.

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:24.200
 And a lot of it's the media trying to give equal weight

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:27.080
 to stories, as you know, as a scientist,

1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:29.600
 it can be frustrating when something's a 10

1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:31.880
 and something's a one and they're equated.

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:34.480
 How do I say this respectfully?

1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:37.560
 I think if science journalists were required

1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:42.400
 to post their credentials alongside their name,

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:44.400
 people would take the articles

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:46.640
 with an additional grain of salt, right?

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:47.480
 I mean, in other words,

1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:49.080
 that I think that the science media

1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:52.280
 is mainly generated around two specific goals.

1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:55.160
 One is to make people very, very afraid

1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:56.800
 or get people very, very excited.

1:11:56.800 --> 1:11:59.160
 And oftentimes the get people excited part

1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:00.320
 is sponsored content.

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:01.800
 And I think that's overlooked.

1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:04.080
 In any case, thank you for that.

1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:07.560
 I want to talk about iron and iron load.

1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:09.840
 We were talking earlier about ferritin

1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:13.200
 and of course women mend straight.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:16.400
 And so their iron needs are greater

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:19.000
 than people, men that don't mend straight

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.760
 or women that don't mend straight.

1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.960
 I don't think we can get right down

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:24.840
 into how much iron somebody needs

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.400
 because it'll vary person to person.

1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:29.600
 But I was surprised to learn that iron

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:33.640
 is actually going to accelerate the aging process

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:36.000
 in various contexts.

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:39.840
 Well, this is a new finding out of Spain.

1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:43.960
 Manuel Serrano's lab has found that excess iron

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:47.760
 will increase the number of senescent cells in the body.

1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:49.840
 And senescent cells are these zombie cells

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:51.520
 that accumulate as you get older

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:54.400
 and they sit there and they cause inflammation mainly

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:56.320
 and also can cause cancer.

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.640
 And it's found that if you get rid of these cells

1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:02.880
 or never accumulate them, you stay younger in animals.

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:05.360
 And there's some really interesting studies

1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:07.200
 out of Mayo Clinic in humans as well.

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:13.480
 So iron is a pro-senescent metal.

1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:17.120
 And so what I think is that if you're taking excess iron

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:19.600
 as a supplement, you're probably accelerating

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:21.080
 your aging process.

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:22.800
 The other thing that I found really interesting

1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:25.720
 is I've looked at hundreds of thousands of people's

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:29.200
 metabolism and their blood biomarkers.

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:32.240
 I was one of the first people in Inside Tracker

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:37.240
 as a board member and I'm still a scientific lead guy.

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.880
 So I can look anonymously at hundreds of thousands

1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:41.320
 of people's blood work.

1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:44.440
 And we also know how fit they are, how old they are.

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:47.000
 Some of them are marathon runners,

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.840
 some of them are CrossFit.

1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:52.680
 And there's a signature of health that actually

1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:54.920
 is different than your average person.

1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:58.040
 Now, I'm not gonna say bad things about MDs

1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:00.320
 because a lot of my best friends are MDs

1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:03.360
 and I work with them at Harvard Medical School.

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.960
 The issue though is that with MD training,

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:09.920
 there's a scale of what's normal.

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:11.960
 And if you're out of that normal range,

1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:12.960
 something must be wrong.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.240
 That's the paradigm that they work under.

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.280
 But first of all, everybody's different

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:18.920
 and you wanna know their baseline and track people

1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:21.720
 over years to know what's normal for them.

1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:23.080
 And what I find, for example,

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.600
 is people who are really healthy and live the way I do

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:31.600
 and have a diet that's fairly vegetarian but not strict

1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:35.240
 still have slightly low hemoglobin levels,

1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:38.080
 slightly low iron, slightly low ferritin,

1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.600
 but we have super amounts of energy.

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:43.720
 We're not anemic and we're getting along with great in life.

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:46.200
 But a doctor who just looks at that might say,

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:48.560
 oh, we need to give you more iron, right?

1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:51.120
 So what I'm getting at is an example of

1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:53.320
 we need to personalize medicine

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:55.560
 and look at people over the long run

1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:00.120
 to know what works for them and what's healthy for them,

1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:02.040
 and not just work towards the average human

1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.720
 but work towards what's optimal for human.

1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:06.360
 I love that answer.

1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:08.440
 You mentioned tracking and tracking over time,

1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:10.840
 and this is a really interesting area

1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:13.960
 that I know you have been focused on for a long time.

1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:17.080
 I've been getting blood work done about every six months,

1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:18.920
 frankly, since I was in college.

1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:22.240
 I like data and I got interested in supplementation

1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:24.260
 and exercise because it made me feel better,

1:15:24.260 --> 1:15:27.000
 but I also want to know what was going on under the hood.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.780
 So you get numbers back.

1:15:28.780 --> 1:15:30.340
 You get this hormone, that hormone,

1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:33.800
 this blood glucose measure, et cetera.

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.800
 How do you make sense of the data?

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:38.240
 I mean, what Inside Tracker is doing aside,

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:40.320
 how do you personally make sense of the data

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:42.640
 in ways that might differ from the way

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:45.120
 that a standard MD might look at one of these charts?

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.920
 Because the standard practice is to say,

1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:49.320
 is it red, yellow, or green, right?

1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:52.200
 Is it basically too high or too low?

1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:56.200
 Is it somewhere close to the margins or are you okay?

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:57.900
 Are you in these ranges?

1:15:57.900 --> 1:16:00.280
 Are there any things that you pay attention to

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:02.800
 that you think are particularly interesting

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:04.280
 for people to just take note of?

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:05.240
 I mean, we're not asking you

1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:06.920
 to go against anybody's physician,

1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:11.600
 but what sorts of things should people

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:13.060
 start to educate themselves about

1:16:13.060 --> 1:16:15.520
 in terms of what these molecules are on their charts

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:17.720
 if they choose to get them and what do you look at?

1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:20.660
 Yeah, well, there's a lot there.

1:16:20.660 --> 1:16:23.840
 The first is that you should be tracking things

1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:25.400
 because one measurement isn't enough.

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:27.000
 These things vary and over time,

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.440
 and if you can have a decade or more of data,

1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:34.440
 it's super informative as you know well know, as you know.

1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:37.840
 So the physician, interestingly, my physician,

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:39.400
 let's take him as an example.

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:44.920
 So he sees me, he says, how are you feeling?

1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:47.160
 I'm feeling great, okay, see you next year.

1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:48.200
 That's craziness.

1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:49.800
 Anyway, so I say, okay, stop.

1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:51.640
 Let's talk a little bit about-

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:52.640
 Let me educate you.

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.440
 That's what David tells his physician.

1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:56.960
 I imagine that the like 12-year-old David Sinclair

1:16:56.960 --> 1:16:58.560
 says to his physician, listen,

1:16:58.560 --> 1:16:59.960
 let's have a different discussion.

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:00.800
 Is that how it works?

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:01.640
 It is.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:06.160
 It is, he finds me pretty annoying as does my dentist.

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:09.760
 But so I said, stop, hang on, I've got this data.

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:11.120
 I've got the inside tracker data.

1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:13.080
 So I pull that up on the screen

1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:16.960
 and I'm showing him the changes in my cholesterol,

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:20.960
 in my CRP, which is inflammatory marker, as you know,

1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:21.800
 and we're going through it

1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:23.360
 and you can see things change over time

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:25.680
 and I've corrected them as they go slightly

1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:27.760
 out of the optimal range for me,

1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:30.040
 which is different than what he would do, of course.

1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:33.160
 But what was funny is that he says, this is great.

1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:36.320
 I love this data, but I'm not allowed to get this

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:39.920
 because of course the insurance companies won't pay for it.

1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.920
 So again, you can pay out of pocket.

1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:43.160
 It's not super expensive.

1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:48.160
 I would say if you save a bit of money on a coffee,

1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:50.360
 you can afford this kind of stuff.

1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:53.600
 But the main point is that doctors do like this data.

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:55.880
 It's just that they're unable to spend the money

1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:58.120
 on every one of their patients to get it.

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:00.320
 Is there a code word that someone can use

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:01.920
 with their physician that will trigger

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:03.520
 a comprehensive blood test?

1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:06.000
 I keep trying to figure out what's the code

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.420
 that one needs to ask or tell their doctor,

1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:12.080
 like I'm feeling blank so that they get a full blood panel.

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:13.660
 Well, do you have to be hemorrhaging

1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:16.040
 from the gut or something?

1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:19.880
 Well, I usually use the WTH method, which is what the hell?

1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:22.400
 And then he says, okay, we'll do it.

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:24.100
 Cause I think a lot of people out there are thinking,

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:26.800
 look, I'd love to have blood work repeatedly over time,

1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:29.360
 but that's hard to get for financial reasons.

1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:30.520
 But also a lot of people just don't know

1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.640
 how to approach the conversation.

1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:33.480
 And this is one of the things

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:36.000
 that I hope that we can educate people on,

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:39.400
 that they deserve to know what's going on inside their body

1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:42.440
 and that it makes a doctor's visit worthwhile

1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:46.040
 and that you don't have to feign illness in order to do it.

1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:47.880
 Right, yeah, and a lot of people do.

1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:49.960
 So I would say if you can afford these tests,

1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:52.000
 there are an increasing number of companies

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000
 that offer these tests.

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:55.920
 Insight Tracker is one of them.

1:18:55.920 --> 1:18:59.700
 And you just do it a couple of times a year at a minimum,

1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:01.800
 and then you can share that with your doctor.

1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:05.040
 If you can't afford that, then I would say to your doctor,

1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:09.440
 here are the main ones that Andrew and David do.

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:10.440
 Yeah, and we must.

1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:13.880
 And there's an email that is something like a phone number,

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:16.600
 rather it's 555-5555.

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:17.880
 I think if they have any complaints,

1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:19.940
 they can just call that number.

1:19:19.940 --> 1:19:22.840
 David will pick up on East Coast business hours

1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:24.920
 and I'll pick up outside of those hours.

1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:25.760
 But there were some main ones.

1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:27.880
 I would say your blood sugar levels,

1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:29.200
 you want to do your HbA1c,

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:32.240
 which is your average glucose levels over the month.

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:35.040
 There's CRP, which I mentioned for inflammation.

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:36.960
 Let's talk about C-reactive protein for a second,

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:40.680
 because I think it's been shown to be an early marker

1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:43.480
 of macular degeneration, of heart disease,

1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:45.320
 of a variety of different things.

1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:48.920
 CRP is something that we don't hear enough about, I think.

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:51.640
 Maybe, what do you know about CRP that I don't?

1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:53.280
 I'm guessing a lot, but.

1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:55.400
 Oh, it was originally picked up as something

1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:56.980
 that was associated with heart disease

1:19:56.980 --> 1:19:59.380
 in the Framingham study, I believe.

1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:03.480
 It is the best marker for cardiovascular inflammation

1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:07.240
 and is also, we use it as a predictor of longevity.

1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:11.720
 And its levels go up with mortality.

1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:13.580
 And so this is an association,

1:20:13.580 --> 1:20:15.760
 but there's enough data that I would say,

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:17.560
 if you have high levels of CRP,

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:20.400
 you need to get your levels down quickly.

1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:23.320
 And the levels usually go up with age

1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:24.520
 and with levels of inflammation.

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:28.000
 So the ways to get it down would be to switch the diet,

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.240
 eat less, try to eat more vegetables.

1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:31.560
 You'll find it will come down.

1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:33.680
 There are also drugs that can do it.

1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:37.220
 Anti-inflammatories can do it as well.

1:20:37.220 --> 1:20:40.000
 But CRP is, it's actually HCRP.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.880
 There's a high-sensitive or HSCRP.

1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:43.240
 Your doctor will know.

1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:44.240
 Get one of those readings,

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:47.200
 because if you've got normal blood sugar levels,

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:50.260
 your doctor, or fasting blood sugar levels,

1:20:50.260 --> 1:20:51.960
 your doctor might say you're fine.

1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:54.000
 But a lot of people have normal blood sugar,

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.720
 but have high CRP, which is just as bad for you long-term

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:01.040
 and can predict a future heart attack.

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:02.320
 On the lines of heart attack,

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:05.080
 I want your thoughts on cholesterol,

1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:07.600
 and serum cholesterol, and dietary cholesterol.

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.880
 I cannot, for the life of me,

1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:12.040
 get my arms around this literature.

1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:16.040
 And even if I ignore all the essentially nonsense

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:19.200
 that's out there in various social media groups

1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:22.680
 that saying cholesterol is the worst thing in the world,

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:26.060
 or cholesterol is not, or dietary cholesterol

1:21:26.060 --> 1:21:28.540
 has nothing to do with serum cholesterol

1:21:28.540 --> 1:21:29.800
 and nothing to do with longevity,

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:34.800
 I can't seem to sort through the very basic data

1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:37.340
 that essentially ask,

1:21:38.300 --> 1:21:43.060
 is having high levels of LDL going to kill me earlier?

1:21:43.060 --> 1:21:47.200
 Should I be striving to always reduce LDL and increase HDL?

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:48.640
 Is that a reasonable goal?

1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:52.040
 And if so, is dietary cholesterol

1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:53.520
 the primary determinant of that?

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:56.640
 And just as a final point about this,

1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:59.800
 I am aware of quite good data that shows that anorexics,

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:01.520
 people that essentially eat no food

1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:02.860
 unless you force them to,

1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:06.880
 can often have very high LDL.

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.360
 So their dietary cholesterol is essentially zero,

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:12.240
 and so they're manufacturing a lot of their own.

1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:15.840
 So realize this isn't your primary area of expertise,

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:17.440
 but you're a smart guy.

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:19.720
 You think about this kind of stuff a lot.

1:22:19.720 --> 1:22:20.880
 What do you think is going on

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:22.100
 with the cholesterol literature,

1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:24.620
 and will we ever get to the bottom of this

1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:26.420
 as a scientific and medical community?

1:22:26.420 --> 1:22:29.180
 Because to me, it is rather perplexing.

1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:34.600
 It is, but you can get through the politics.

1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:35.920
 I know a fair bit about cholesterol

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:39.040
 because it's in my family history,

1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:41.600
 and I was headed for an early death.

1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.400
 My grandmother had a stroke at 30.

1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:46.800
 That's how bad I am in terms of my genetics.

1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:47.980
 So I went on a statin,

1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:49.240
 and I know there's a lot of people

1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:51.360
 who say that statins long-term are bad.

1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:54.280
 It's associated with Alzheimer's disease.

1:22:57.380 --> 1:23:00.380
 I've been taking a statin since I was 29,

1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:02.720
 and that's because I forced my same doctor

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:04.280
 to give me the statin.

1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:06.040
 The conversation was something like this.

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:08.320
 You're too young to be on a statin.

1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:10.160
 I said, what, you want me to have a heart attack

1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:11.360
 before you give me something?

1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:12.200
 Give it to me now.

1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:13.920
 So 29, I've been on a statin,

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:16.760
 and my cholesterol was way up beyond 300,

1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:18.080
 which is a massive, massive.

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.560
 Basically, my blood was creamy to look at.

1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:24.580
 So I've now got my cholesterol down to low, low levels

1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:26.440
 to what would it be?

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:28.100
 You could check on my inside tracker,

1:23:28.100 --> 1:23:30.440
 but so my ratio of HDL to LDL,

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:33.040
 which you want to be less than five, is now two,

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:35.280
 and the LDL is below 100.

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:36.240
 So it's all good.

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:39.280
 And I've measured my cardiovascular health with an MRI.

1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:41.300
 I've got a movie of my heart beating.

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:43.360
 I've still got a heart of a 20-year-old.

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:45.360
 So that's working.

1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:46.760
 I'm willing to forego the risk

1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:48.640
 that the statin is causing problems later

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:50.420
 because of my family history.

1:23:50.420 --> 1:23:52.440
 But other people, I would say,

1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:57.000
 be aware that statins aren't perfect drugs.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.400
 There are some interesting new ones.

1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:00.780
 There's one called the PSK-9 inhibitor,

1:24:00.780 --> 1:24:04.360
 which is, I think, fortnightly, every two weeks, injection.

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:08.040
 That blocks the release of LDL from the liver.

1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:13.220
 And then that seems to be great for lowering cholesterol,

1:24:13.220 --> 1:24:17.360
 but also has other benefits that might be pro-longevity.

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:20.360
 And there were some people that I was just talking to

1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:21.840
 are on the cutting edge of this,

1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:23.920
 and their doctors are trying them on this drug

1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:25.760
 instead of the statin.

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:28.260
 So you could talk to your doctor about that.

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:32.760
 Do you avoid dietary cholesterol for that reason also?

1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.040
 Red meat, butter.

1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:35.280
 I mean, I happen to love butter.

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:36.980
 I love red meat.

1:24:36.980 --> 1:24:39.720
 I realize there's some people who don't.

1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:40.920
 My cholesterol is a little bit high,

1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:43.440
 but I'm working to bring that down a bit,

1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:46.660
 although not by altering my food intake yet.

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.360
 But what do you think is the relationship

1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:51.720
 between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol?

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:53.480
 And what's going on with the liver?

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:57.520
 Why are anorexics, why is their serum cholesterol so high

1:24:57.520 --> 1:24:58.720
 when they're eating nothing?

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:00.640
 Well, there've been a number of papers over the years

1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:02.040
 that have been ignored.

1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:04.000
 And our friend, Peter Atiyah,

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.080
 brought to my attention recently a new study

1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:09.140
 that I think definitively said

1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:12.480
 that dietary cholesterol has almost zero impact

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:13.840
 on blood cholesterol levels.

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:14.680
 Good.

1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:17.240
 Yeah, so I'm annoyed,

1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:19.280
 because I've been avoiding eggs and butter

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:22.180
 for most of my life, and I didn't have to.

1:25:22.180 --> 1:25:26.280
 So I had eggs plenty of time, at least in your case.

1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:28.680
 Yeah, yeah, so that's the thing.

1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:31.720
 You can eat these foods that were once banned,

1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:34.640
 because it's very difficult to take cholesterol up

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:36.160
 into the body from the gut,

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.280
 and most of it's being synthesized in the body.

1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:41.160
 Wow, I'm just pausing there for a second,

1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:45.920
 because I think that it's what we've been told,

1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:49.840
 six meals a day, eat a lot of grains and fruits

1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:54.840
 and this kind of thing, avoid cholesterol.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:58.880
 I mean, basically everything we learned in the 80s and 90s

1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:01.940
 and early 2000s is getting flipped on its head now.

1:26:01.940 --> 1:26:06.940
 But, and I think this is a very strong caveat

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:12.560
 that's important to mention, amino acids,

1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.000
 in particular the amino acids

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.200
 that come from animal products, right?

1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:21.240
 Seem to have some pro-aging effect on them, right?

1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:24.720
 At least the way that I've heard you describe your diet.

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.840
 And I'm somebody who enjoys meat, I like it.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:31.160
 But, so I'm by no means a vegan at all.

1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:34.800
 But I've heard you say you eat mostly plants,

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.160
 but a little bit of fish or chicken

1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:40.640
 or something of that sort, or eggs or,

1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:43.520
 but is that specifically to avoid

1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:45.160
 excessive amino acid intake?

1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:46.960
 Or is it something specific about plants

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.100
 that excites you with respect to,

1:26:50.100 --> 1:26:52.680
 I mean, vegetables are delicious too, but what is it?

1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:54.040
 Is it something great about plants

1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:56.440
 or is it something bad about, when I think of meat,

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:59.400
 I guess the biologist in me thinks amino acids, right?

1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:01.760
 I don't think top sirloin, I think amino acid.

1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:03.300
 No, I think top sirloin as I'm eating it,

1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:07.220
 but really what they are are amino acids, including leucine.

1:27:07.220 --> 1:27:10.680
 Yeah, well, there are two good things about plants

1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:13.800
 and neither of them is taste for me.

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:15.660
 I would eat steak all the time if I could.

1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:18.480
 I did when I was a kid, I'm an Australian.

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:19.740
 But plants have two benefits.

1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:22.800
 One is that they're highly nutritious

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.500
 and they'll give you a lot of the vitamins

1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:28.060
 and nutrients that I need.

1:27:28.060 --> 1:27:30.200
 I don't take a multivitamin, I don't wanna

1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:32.200
 have the excess iron in my body.

1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:34.160
 So there's that high density nutrition.

1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:37.640
 So those dark leaves, if it's a spinach salad, great.

1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:41.360
 Second is that there is what's called

1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:44.360
 xenohormatic molecules in plants.

1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:48.480
 That term xenohormesis is a term that I came up with

1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:52.800
 with my friend Conrad Howitz, which means

1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:56.220
 stressed plants make molecules that benefit your health.

1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:57.120
 I'll break it down.

1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:00.360
 Xeno means between species and hormesis is the term

1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:02.340
 whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger

1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:03.900
 and live longer.

1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:07.600
 And the idea is that when plants are stressed out,

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:09.600
 think of a grapevine that's dried out

1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:11.200
 and they're starting to harvest the grapes,

1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:13.160
 which is typically how it's done.

1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:15.800
 They are full with resveratrol because resveratrol

1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:19.220
 is a plant defense molecule that I think is made

1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:21.480
 to activate those sirtuin genes in a plant.

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:24.200
 So plants have sirtuins just like we do.

1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.000
 But by purifying or at least concentrating

1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.920
 in a light proof bottle and keeping it out of the air,

1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:33.600
 we stabilize this xenohormatic molecule,

1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:36.900
 or it's a cocktail, not just one, there's others in wine.

1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:39.680
 We then ingest those and get the benefits

1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:41.200
 of activating our own defenses

1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:43.560
 because our food was getting stressed out.

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:45.580
 And by stressed, I don't mean psychologically stressed,

1:28:45.580 --> 1:28:47.480
 I mean biologically stressed.

1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:50.680
 And so I try to eat plants that have gone through

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:53.120
 a bit of stress, they might be brightly colored,

1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:57.320
 they've had too much sun or got nibbled on by a caterpillar.

1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:59.840
 So you go to places where it's organic or it's fresh,

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:01.860
 local, and those are the plants that aren't perfect

1:29:01.860 --> 1:29:03.200
 and they probably have high concentrations

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:04.040
 of these molecules.

1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:06.640
 And in addition, I also buy the supplements

1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:08.640
 to make sure I'm getting enough of those as well.

1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:09.920
 Which supplements mimic that?

1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:11.080
 Well, so resveratrol will,

1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:12.840
 there's another one called chrysotin,

1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:14.600
 or chrysotin, some people call it,

1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:18.480
 which you find in trace amounts in apples and onions.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.720
 And we also showed back in 2003

1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:23.080
 that it activates sirtuins as well,

1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:25.240
 but others have, 20 years later,

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:28.360
 found that it kills senescent cells

1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:30.560
 or helps kill senescent cells.

1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:33.360
 So it's a double whammy with that molecule.

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:35.440
 And are you actively picking out the peaches

1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:38.560
 that look like they were nibbled on by a caterpillar?

1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.200
 No, but I don't worry if they've been banged up a bit.

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:45.120
 What's the story with antioxidants?

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.800
 Are they of any value whatsoever?

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:50.160
 Because the way that you described them at the beginning

1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:52.120
 and what I've heard recently is that

1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:56.000
 they are not all the rage for anti-aging.

1:29:57.280 --> 1:29:58.680
 What are they doing that's useful?

1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:02.040
 Should we be seeking out antioxidants anyway

1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:04.440
 for other cellular health purposes?

1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:06.560
 Well, yeah, antioxidants are not going to hurt you

1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:08.200
 unless you take mega doses.

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:11.960
 We do need some oxidants for our immune system.

1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:14.040
 And there's even what's called mitohormesis,

1:30:14.040 --> 1:30:16.080
 which is your mitochondria power packs

1:30:16.080 --> 1:30:18.400
 need to have a little bit of these free radicals

1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:19.720
 to be able to function.

1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:23.520
 So you don't want to overdose on these antioxidants,

1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:26.800
 vitamin C, vitamin E, don't overdo it.

1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:28.520
 You don't take a multivitamin, correct?

1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:29.800
 Right.

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:31.840
 I think I'm going to stop after this conversation

1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:33.080
 because I've always just taken one

1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:34.640
 for the kind of insurance purpose,

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:38.480
 which is a stupid purpose, not actual insurance,

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:39.760
 but just thinking, oh, you know,

1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:42.920
 I'll top off on my ACBD.

1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:45.160
 Right, and I'll pee out what I don't need.

1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:46.640
 Right, but that never bothered me.

1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:48.440
 The whole expensive pee thing never got,

1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:50.600
 that argument never got me

1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:53.760
 because a good vitamin is not that expensive.

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:56.400
 I just figured better safe than sorry,

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:58.840
 but it may be that it's detrimental.

1:30:58.840 --> 1:31:00.760
 Well, it can in the case of iron,

1:31:00.760 --> 1:31:02.680
 as we discussed, and the antioxidants.

1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:07.640
 So when I came into the aging field in the early 1990s,

1:31:07.640 --> 1:31:09.120
 it was all about antioxidants.

1:31:09.120 --> 1:31:12.520
 And we thought that enzymes by the name of catalase

1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:13.880
 and superoxide dismutase

1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:16.480
 were going to be the key to longevity.

1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:18.920
 It turns out that it's largely been a failure

1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:23.800
 that giving animals and humans antioxidants

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:27.480
 haven't had the longevity benefits that we dreamed of.

1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:31.440
 And the main reason is that there's a lot more going on

1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:33.920
 than just free radical damage.

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:35.720
 The epigenome gets disrupted.

1:31:35.720 --> 1:31:37.480
 We've got these proteins misfolding.

1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:42.080
 So the problem really has been that we didn't realize

1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:45.560
 that you need to turn on the body's natural defenses

1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:47.880
 against that plus a whole host of other things

1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:50.120
 to get the true benefits.

1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:51.360
 But I'm not going to say it's a problem

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:53.920
 taking an antioxidant drink.

1:31:53.920 --> 1:31:56.000
 Pomegranate juice for one is full of good stuff,

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.520
 including xenochromatic molecules.

1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:00.880
 But resveratrol is a good case in point,

1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:03.360
 which is when I worked on resveratrol

1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:05.080
 as a longevity molecule,

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.920
 first we showed it in yeast and worms and flies and mice.

1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:11.640
 Before that, it was thought that resveratrol

1:32:11.640 --> 1:32:13.760
 was good for your heart in red wine,

1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:16.720
 when you drink red wine, because it's an antioxidant.

1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:18.880
 So then we showed that it extended the lifespan

1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:23.880
 of yeast cells through this genetic pathway, the sirtuins.

1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:28.400
 And we then tested whether resveratrol,

1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:31.880
 if we changed one atom to make it not an antioxidant,

1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:32.720
 guess what?

1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:33.640
 It still worked fine.

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:35.480
 So it wasn't its antioxidant activity

1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:36.560
 that was extending lifespan.

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:38.960
 It was its ability to turn on the yeast's defenses

1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:40.120
 against aging.

1:32:40.120 --> 1:32:42.720
 Conversely, when we gave the yeast antioxidants,

1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:44.480
 they lived shorter.

1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:46.840
 So yeah, that was the beginning of my transformation

1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:49.000
 into thinking, turn on the body's defenses,

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.760
 don't give it the antioxidants.

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:53.160
 This is an opportunity for me to say

1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:55.640
 something that I've been wanting to say for a long time,

1:32:55.640 --> 1:32:58.600
 which is that what's so wonderful about science

1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:01.480
 is that because the goal is mechanism,

1:33:01.480 --> 1:33:04.320
 you can really start to understand, as you just described,

1:33:05.920 --> 1:33:07.840
 what actually mediates a process

1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:10.000
 is very different than what modulates a process.

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.160
 I mean, if a fire alarm goes off in the building right now,

1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:13.960
 it's going to modulate our attention.

1:33:13.960 --> 1:33:16.440
 That doesn't mean that it controls our attention.

1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:18.320
 It's not mechanistically relevant.

1:33:18.320 --> 1:33:20.160
 And so I think this thing about antioxidants

1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:22.440
 is one of these cases, it sounds like,

1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:24.840
 where it's in the right ballpark,

1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:27.720
 but until one really unveils the mechanism as you have,

1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:32.720
 you can be, one can or a field can be badly wrong

1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:34.480
 for a very long period of time.

1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:37.200
 It sounds like the sirtuins,

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:39.920
 and really getting down to the guts of the machinery

1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:43.400
 of what causes cells to age is really what it's about.

1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:48.000
 Zooming way out, what are the behavioral tools

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:49.720
 that one can start to think about

1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:51.520
 in terms of ways to modulate these,

1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:55.120
 basically the way that DNA is being expressed

1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:56.480
 and functioning?

1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:00.680
 I've heard you talk before about hormesis of other sorts,

1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:03.440
 cold exposure, we talked about fasting.

1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:05.560
 We talked about exercise in broad terms,

1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:10.560
 but what about any evidence, if it exists,

1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:13.320
 as to whether or not aerobic training

1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:16.040
 versus weight training, these sorts of things.

1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:17.600
 In other words, what are the sorts of things

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:21.320
 that people can do to improve the sirtuin pathway?

1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.240
 And I realize that they're caveats.

1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:25.440
 We can't go directly from a behavior to sirtuins,

1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:28.400
 but in the general theme, what can people do?

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:29.320
 What do you do?

1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:30.160
 Right.

1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:33.640
 Well, we know that aerobic exercise in mice and rats

1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:37.000
 raises their NAD levels and their levels of sirt,

1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:39.880
 one of the genes goes up to actually number one

1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:41.160
 and number three.

1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:44.920
 What we don't know yet is what type of exercise

1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:47.560
 is optimal to get them to change.

1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:49.200
 We will learn, we're doing work.

1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:50.800
 Now it's revealed that we're doing work

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:52.560
 with the military in the US

1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:55.000
 to try and understand that kind of thing.

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.160
 And I'll always tell you and the public

1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:00.360
 when I don't know something, I'm not gonna extrapolate.

1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:02.080
 But what do I do?

1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:05.080
 I base my exercise on the scientific literature,

1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:08.760
 which has shown that maintaining muscle mass

1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:10.880
 is very important for a number of reasons.

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.720
 The two main ones are,

1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:14.240
 you wanna maintain your hormone levels.

1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:17.040
 I'm an older male losing my testosterone

1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:18.880
 and muscle mass over time.

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.160
 And by exercising, I will maintain that and have.

1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.040
 In fact, I probably haven't had a body like this

1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:26.880
 since I was 20.

1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:30.280
 So that's one of the benefits of having this lifestyle.

1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:33.520
 Sorry to interrupt you, we did an episode on hormones

1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:35.480
 and there are data in humans that show

1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:39.920
 that there are some males in their 80s and 90s

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:41.840
 where their testosterone is equivalent

1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:44.600
 to the average of 25 and 30 year olds.

1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:45.840
 I can get you that information.

1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:48.320
 It is really impressive studies.

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:51.200
 Unfortunately, they didn't include a lot of information

1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:52.840
 about the lifestyle factors, et cetera.

1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:55.680
 But this idea that testosterone goes down with age,

1:35:56.800 --> 1:35:59.640
 it might be the trend

1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:02.400
 but it's not necessarily a prerequisite.

1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:06.600
 Right, I believe in naturally increasing

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.040
 and maintaining these hormone levels.

1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:10.720
 And I've been measuring them for a long time.

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:11.800
 And I could see for me,

1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:14.120
 my testosterone levels were steadily,

1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:15.160
 levels were going down.

1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:18.120
 And then you got tenure and they went back up again.

1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:23.120
 No, I actually became complacent and it was the worst.

1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:26.680
 Actually, my age changed in the wrong direction after that

1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:30.120
 because I was relaxed and not worried about the future.

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:32.640
 But then I got serious.

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:35.200
 And I actually, according to the inside tracker algorithm,

1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.200
 got my age down from 58 to 31 in a matter of months.

1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:41.840
 That was a big drop.

1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:43.440
 And I've been getting steadily younger

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:44.640
 over the last 10 years,

1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:46.520
 according to that measurement, the blood tests.

1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:47.400
 What about estrogen?

1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:50.760
 Because women are different in the sense that they do,

1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:56.040
 the number of eggs and the ovaries change over time, right?

1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:58.880
 Do you think that they can maintain estrogen levels

1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:01.640
 in over longer periods of time

1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:03.320
 using some of these same protocols?

1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:06.600
 Well, yeah, I get into trouble from a certain university

1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:08.920
 when I talk about this too much.

1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:10.240
 About estrogen?

1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:14.560
 Just about fertility and long story.

1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:18.760
 I don't want to get too much into the anecdotes,

1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:19.760
 but I'll tell you the science,

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:24.520
 which is that if you take a mouse

1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:27.680
 and put it on fasting or caloric restriction

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:31.760
 for up until the point where it should be infertile,

1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:33.440
 so that's about it at a year of age,

1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:35.160
 a mouse gets infertile, a female mouse.

1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:38.120
 Due to fasting or due to simply to aging?

1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:39.920
 Due to aging, due to aging.

1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:42.800
 The fasting, it's not an extreme fast,

1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:44.720
 it's just less calories.

1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:47.320
 Then you put them back on a regular food

1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:49.200
 and they become fertile again

1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:51.520
 for many, many months afterwards.

1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:55.040
 So the effect on slowing down aging

1:37:55.040 --> 1:37:56.960
 is also on the reproductive system.

1:37:56.960 --> 1:37:58.000
 Interesting.

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.200
 And so I wouldn't say to any woman,

1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:02.600
 I wouldn't think that they should become super skinny

1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:04.120
 to try and preserve fertility.

1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:05.440
 That's not what I'm saying.

1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:07.160
 But these pathways that we work on,

1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:10.360
 these sirtuins, are known to delay infertility

1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:12.080
 in female animals.

1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:15.080
 Case in point, I'm one of the lead authors on a paper

1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:16.640
 where we used NMN.

1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:18.680
 Remember, this is the gas, the fuel,

1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:20.400
 the petrol for the sirtuins.

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:25.400
 We gave old mice, one group of mice was 16 months old.

1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:29.640
 Remember, they came infertile at 12,

1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:34.120
 gave them NMN, and I think it was only six weeks later,

1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:36.800
 they had offspring.

1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:38.040
 They became fertile again,

1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:41.320
 which goes against biology, a textbook biology,

1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:44.760
 which is that female mammals run out of eggs.

1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:46.760
 Turns out that's not true.

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:49.680
 You can rejuvenate the female reproductive system

1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:52.520
 and even get them to come out of mouse support,

1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:53.920
 as we call it.

1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:56.560
 So that's a whole new paradigm in biology as well.

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:57.720
 That's super interesting.

1:38:57.720 --> 1:38:58.560
 Sorry to interrupt you,

1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:01.720
 but I'm reminded of a set of studies that were done

1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:04.360
 by your former colleagues, because they're no longer there,

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:05.760
 David Hubel and Torrance Wiesel,

1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:07.960
 my scientific great-grandparents, won the Nobel Prize

1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:10.920
 for discovering what are called critical periods,

1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:12.240
 this phase of early development

1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.000
 when the brain is extremely plastic.

1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.200
 And a big part of their work was to show

1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:18.360
 that after a certain point,

1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:19.800
 the critical period shuts down,

1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:23.600
 essentially the brain can't change or not nearly as much.

1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:24.760
 And then people came along later

1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:26.000
 and showed that you could open up

1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.600
 these critical periods again, but very briefly,

1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.080
 and it takes a very specific stimulus, essentially,

1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:35.280
 high degrees of focus, et cetera.

1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:39.280
 However, there's a well-known phenomenon in this literature

1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:43.360
 where if you take an animal, and to some degree,

1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:45.760
 this has been shown in humans as well,

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:48.000
 and you let them pass through the critical period,

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.040
 but then you essentially sensory deprive them.

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:54.280
 You take away experience, you close both eyes.

1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:57.120
 You essentially reopen the critical period.

1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:59.440
 So it seems like, and I couldn't help but mention this,

1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:01.800
 that there's this parallel between what we're talking about

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:03.600
 here with fertility and neuroplasticity,

1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:06.480
 where, yes, there's a timer where certain things

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:09.120
 are available to the organism early in life,

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:10.680
 and then they tend to taper off.

1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:12.800
 It's not an open and shut, but they taper off.

1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:16.240
 But then a deprivation can actually reactivate

1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:19.280
 the availability of that process.

1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:20.800
 Forgive me, I just couldn't help but mention it,

1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:24.480
 but to me, both of those things are associated with youth,

1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:26.240
 fertility and neuroplasticity.

1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:28.560
 And so I think that it'd be so interesting,

1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:29.920
 I'd love to collaborate with you on this

1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:32.880
 to explore how neuroplasticity might actually be regulated

1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:35.440
 by these things like the sirtuins.

1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:38.720
 Right, and the sirtuins do control memory

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:39.840
 in neurons as well.

1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:42.440
 So what I think is really interesting is that

1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:45.600
 what we're learning from the research is that

1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.800
 from work that you and your colleagues have done

1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.360
 and in my lab as well,

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:52.440
 is that the body has remarkable powers of healing

1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:56.440
 and recovering from illness and injury.

1:40:56.440 --> 1:40:58.480
 And what we once thought was a one-way street

1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:00.720
 and you just can't repair,

1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:02.880
 you can't get over these diseases,

1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:04.200
 you can reset the system.

1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:06.120
 And the body can really get rejuvenated

1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:08.040
 in ways that in the future will wonder

1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:10.200
 why didn't we work on this earlier?

1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:12.960
 The future of humanity is more like

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:14.680
 us walking around like Deadpool.

1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:17.720
 We'll probably be cleaner and we won't smell as badly,

1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:20.720
 but Deadpool, if you don't know,

1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:22.160
 can get injured and just recover.

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:25.280
 It's very hard to injure this guy.

1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:26.320
 And we're gonna be the same.

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:28.480
 There are many species, you cut off the limb,

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:29.320
 the limb grows back.

1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:30.920
 Salamanders, yeah.

1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:33.600
 We are now learning how to tap into that system.

1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:36.360
 And in part, what we're doing is reversing the age

1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:38.360
 of those cells and telling them

1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:40.800
 how to read the genes correctly again,

1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:43.480
 reversing the age of that epigenome.

1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:45.160
 And when you do that, the cells,

1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:47.920
 the brain, for instance, the skin,

1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:49.760
 we did the optic nerve.

1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:51.440
 Now let's talk about those results for a second.

1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:52.680
 Then I want to make sure that we return

1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:54.360
 to some of these behavioral protocols.

1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.440
 You had this amazing paper at the end of last year,

1:41:56.440 --> 1:41:59.760
 cover article, full article in Nature,

1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:02.880
 showing that essentially a small menu

1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:05.080
 of transcription factors,

1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:07.440
 which control gene expression, et cetera,

1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:11.960
 could essentially reverse the age of neurons in the eye

1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:14.920
 and rescue those cells against damage,

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:18.760
 essentially allow blind mice to see again

1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:21.560
 and offset degeneration of these retinal cells.

1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:26.560
 Incredible paper and such a boon to the field.

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:28.520
 Where does that stand now

1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:30.080
 in terms of human clinical trials?

1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:32.640
 I mean, what are you envisioning

1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:35.240
 in terms of the trajectory of those data

1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:38.640
 from mice into humans someday?

1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:43.480
 Right, well, to get to the point immediately,

1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:48.480
 we're going to be testing the treatment on monkeys,

1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:50.800
 just for safety reasons.

1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.920
 And then the first patient should be done

1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:56.280
 sometime in 2022, early 2023,

1:42:56.280 --> 1:42:58.560
 and we're going to try to recover blindness.

1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:00.320
 This involves making an injection

1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:02.680
 of a virus into the eye, right?

1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:05.280
 Right now, there's no way that I am aware of

1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:07.000
 to manipulate these transcription factors

1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.720
 through a pill or some other.

1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:11.760
 That's what we're working on in my lab at Harvard right now.

1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:12.600
 So it will be-

1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:14.440
 Pill-based modulation of transcription factors.

1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:15.280
 It will be a proper pill

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:16.960
 and the whole body gets rejuvenated by 20 years.

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:18.440
 That's what we're aiming for.

1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:23.080
 Now we do it with gene therapy in the eye and other places.

1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:25.720
 So in the eye, yes, it's single injection.

1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:27.360
 The genes go into the retina

1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:31.200
 and we can turn it on with a drug called doxycycline.

1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:34.640
 And we do that in the mice for four to eight weeks.

1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:36.120
 Then the eye gets younger.

1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:38.880
 We can measure that because we can measure the clock.

1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:41.760
 And then the vision comes back in those mice.

1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:44.840
 And I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work in people

1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:47.480
 because it's the same structures and mechanisms

1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:49.840
 that are on in the human as well.

1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:50.680
 Now these-

1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:51.520
 And it's one injection.

1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:53.560
 As you mentioned, injections into the eye,

1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:55.040
 obviously nobody should do this

1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:57.040
 outside of an ophthalmology clinic.

1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.040
 And they're definitely by an ophthalmologist.

1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:03.640
 But the injections into the eye are painless

1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:05.440
 if done correctly by the right person.

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:07.360
 It sounds dreadful, but it's actually,

1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:09.240
 I've seen it done hundreds of times.

1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:11.360
 I've done it thousands of times,

1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:14.720
 and it's not to myself, but to other creatures.

1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:15.840
 And there's a way of doing this

1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:17.560
 that's completely painless to the person.

1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:18.400
 Oh, there are a few.

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:20.240
 It's a tiny, tiny needle too.

1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:21.280
 But the great thing about this

1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:22.800
 is that it's a one-time treatment.

1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:24.240
 Those genes go into the back of the eye

1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:27.440
 and stay there forever.

1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:29.840
 And you can just turn them on whenever you want.

1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:32.360
 So what we've found is you can turn them on in the mice,

1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:33.720
 they get their vision back,

1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:35.440
 and then you turn it off again.

1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:37.480
 And so far, many months out,

1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:39.520
 the benefit has remained.

1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:41.280
 But if it does decline,

1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:43.600
 we'll just turn it back on and reset the system,

1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:45.120
 rinse and repeat.

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:46.360
 So one day, what's exciting

1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:47.760
 is that we could potentially do this

1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:49.080
 across the entire body

1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:53.480
 and just take this antibiotic every five years

1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:55.520
 and go back time and time again.

1:44:56.560 --> 1:44:57.600
 In thinking about the body

1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:58.880
 and what's going on under the hood,

1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:01.760
 I'm amazed still that there isn't

1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:03.920
 a simple, affordable technology

1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:05.760
 that would allow me to just look into my body

1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:08.240
 and see whether or not there are any tumors growing anywhere.

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.760
 I mean, it's not that hard to look into the body.

1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:12.160
 I mean, that the technology exists.

1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:14.600
 Why hasn't anybody created an at-home

1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:16.680
 or pseudo at-home solution,

1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:19.720
 like a clinic where you can go and pay 50 bucks or 100 bucks

1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:21.360
 and see if you have any tumors growing in your body?

1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:22.920
 Yeah, it's still expensive.

1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:26.360
 You can get your doctor to try to get you in.

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.360
 There's some companies that offer blood tests

1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:31.560
 that look at circulating DNA that'll measure it.

1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:32.400
 We're getting there.

1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:34.040
 We're still probably five to 10 years away

1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:35.600
 from being really cheap.

1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:40.480
 You can do things like a colon cancer test at home.

1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:42.680
 I think it's a hundred and something dollars.

1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:46.160
 You ship off your shit, excuse my language,

1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:47.640
 and they measure it.

1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:50.400
 And they tell you if you've got colon cancer

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:52.000
 with high probability.

1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000
 I did that during the pandemic

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.240
 because I didn't want to get a colonoscopy.

1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.880
 Is it more accurate or as accurate as a colonoscopy?

1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:01.000
 I believe it's close to being as accurate.

1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.240
 The downside is that during a colonoscopy,

1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:06.560
 they can pinch off the polyps that are looking dangerous,

1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:08.760
 whereas this obviously isn't that.

1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:10.440
 But it's certainly easier to do.

1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:12.920
 And my father, who's Australian,

1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:14.840
 tells me that it's free for Australians.

1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:17.160
 They get this test routinely.

1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:19.000
 Interesting.

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:22.680
 I want to return to the topic that I took us away from,

1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:25.760
 so I apologize, which is behavioral protocols.

1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:28.320
 Do you regularly do the cold shower thing,

1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:29.960
 ice baths, cold water swims?

1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:31.440
 Are you into that whole biz?

1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:37.040
 Well, you do know that I've done it at least once

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:38.000
 because we did it together.

1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:38.840
 That's right.

1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:40.760
 Not the same bath, just to be very clear.

1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:42.760
 Same sauna, different ice baths.

1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:44.520
 The idea of Sinclair and Huberman

1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:46.360
 taking an ice bath together is,

1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:48.040
 it might warm some people's hearts,

1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:50.480
 but just to be very clear,

1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:53.720
 same ice bath, different times.

1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:54.560
 Yeah.

1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:56.160
 Thank you for clarifying.

1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:57.800
 I don't do them regularly.

1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:01.160
 I do try to sleep cool.

1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:03.760
 I sleep better anyway.

1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:06.960
 I try to dress without a lot of warm clothes.

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:09.160
 I'm here in a t-shirt and it's middle of summer,

1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:11.800
 but in winter, I'll try to wear a t-shirt too.

1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:14.600
 So you're challenging your system to thermoregulate.

1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:15.680
 Right, right.

1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:18.640
 I've got this hypothesis with Ray Cronus.

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:21.200
 We published what's called the metabolic winter hypothesis,

1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:24.440
 which is, tens of thousands of years ago,

1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:26.760
 we were either hungry or cold or both.

1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:28.760
 And we rarely experienced that now.

1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:32.320
 And so we try to give ourselves the metabolic winter.

1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:33.440
 And part of the problem, I think,

1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:36.680
 with the obesity epidemic is that we're never cold.

1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:38.640
 And cold, when you're cold, you have to burn energy.

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.280
 It may be only slightly.

1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.560
 But over the whole night, if you're a little bit cool,

1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:43.960
 you'll actually expend more energy.

1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:45.440
 So I try to do that.

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:48.040
 But I'm not a big fan of cold showers.

1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:51.720
 The sauna, I don't have access to my gym as much as I did.

1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:52.960
 But I do wanna get back into it.

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:55.480
 I used to do it regularly with my son

1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.240
 and I posted on Instagram once

1:47:57.240 --> 1:47:58.800
 that he could stay in there for 15 minutes

1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:01.480
 and I could only stay in for about three.

1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:02.640
 Anyway, long story short,

1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:05.680
 I try to compensate with changes in my diet and exercise

1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:07.120
 until I get back into it.

1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:10.040
 You reminded me of something that I meant to ask earlier,

1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:13.920
 that obesity reduces NAD levels and accelerates aging.

1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:15.880
 How?

1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:20.880
 I mean, okay, so again, this is the scientist in us.

1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:24.040
 So someone's carrying a lot of excess adipose tissues,

1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:27.080
 subcutaneous and visceral fat.

1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:31.840
 But why should that reduce NAD in any ways

1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:34.760
 that are independent of effects on glucose and insulin?

1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:38.200
 Is there something direct about white adipose tissue?

1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:40.320
 And the reason I ask this

1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:43.160
 is not simply to dig into mechanism alone,

1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:45.080
 but I think there are really interesting data now

1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:47.440
 that fat actually gets neural innervation.

1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:51.760
 I mean, it's not just stored fuel.

1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:54.920
 It's stored fuel that's acting as an endocrine organ,

1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:55.760
 essentially.

1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:00.520
 So yeah, why would being fat make people age faster?

1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:04.640
 Yeah, that's a question that is so obvious,

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:06.200
 but so few people ask it.

1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:08.560
 That's what makes you a good scientist.

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:09.760
 And so that we don't know,

1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:11.360
 but I'll give you my best answer,

1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:15.720
 which is that obesity comes along with a lot of problems

1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:20.040
 that include a lot of senescent cells in fat.

1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:24.320
 If you stain old fat for senescent cells, it lights up.

1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:26.520
 And when you kill off those cells,

1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.440
 at least in mice and maybe in humans,

1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:32.120
 it looks like the fat is less toxic to the body

1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:33.680
 because those senescent cells in the fat

1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:35.960
 are secreting these inflammatory molecules

1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:38.840
 that will accelerate aging as we now know.

1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.880
 You talk about the sirtuins and NAD.

1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:47.720
 So if we just look philosophically at why this would be,

1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:51.480
 the sirtuins only like to come on or get activated

1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:55.080
 when the body is under adversity.

1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:59.760
 And if a cell is surrounded by fat or contains a lot of fat,

1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:01.160
 it's going to think times are good,

1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:02.200
 doesn't need to switch on.

1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:05.080
 So that's the evolutionary argument.

1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:07.280
 Mechanistically, we don't know,

1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:08.520
 but it could have something to do

1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:10.360
 with the response to glucose,

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:13.360
 which then responds to the sirtuin gene.

1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:15.160
 But that hasn't been worked out very well.

1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:16.320
 And is there any evidence

1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:17.960
 that leptin, this hormone from fat,

1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:21.280
 can actually interact with the sirtuin pathway?

1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:23.640
 I don't recall seeing that.

1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:25.240
 Maybe I could do a sabbatical in your lab

1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:26.920
 and that'd be a fun one.

1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:27.760
 Definitely.

1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:29.200
 Because leptin during development

1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:31.160
 is what triggers the permission

1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:33.840
 for the hypothalamus to enter puberty, right?

1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:34.680
 Yes.

1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:36.080
 This is why kids that eat a lot

1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:37.480
 when they're young and get overweight

1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:40.360
 will also start to undergo puberty more quickly,

1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:43.280
 although they have reproductive issues later.

1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:46.120
 Well, yeah, we should study the hypothalamus together

1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:50.200
 because the hypothalamus can control the aging of the body.

1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:52.280
 The most interesting part of the brain.

1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:53.120
 For sure.

1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:53.960
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:50:53.960 --> 1:50:55.520
 If you turn on the SIRT1 gene,

1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:57.920
 the sirtuin gene that we work on in the hypothalamus,

1:50:57.920 --> 1:50:59.800
 it actually will extend lifespan.

1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:02.320
 Also, it's been shown by Dongxin Cai

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:04.040
 at Albert Einstein College of Medicine

1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:06.080
 that if you inhibit inflammation

1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:08.160
 in the hypothalamus in a mouse,

1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:11.880
 it will increase or maintain the expression

1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:13.360
 of what's called GnRH,

1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:16.560
 which is the hormone that he found actually controls

1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.560
 longevity in the mouse in part.

1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:21.240
 And so keeping inflammation down in the hypothalamus

1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:23.880
 is sufficient to extend the lifespan of animals.

1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:27.760
 And I reviewed that paper for Nature about seven years ago.

1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:29.240
 And that was the first demonstration

1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:32.360
 that the hypothalamus is one of the leading regulators

1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:33.440
 of the body's age.

1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:34.440
 I find this fascinating.

1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:37.120
 GnRH, for those of you that don't know,

1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:39.240
 actually comes from neurons in the hypothalamus

1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:42.280
 that then literally reach down into the pituitary

1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:43.640
 and trigger the release of all the things

1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:45.240
 that control fertility,

1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:48.640
 luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, et cetera.

1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:50.160
 It's such a powerful set of neurons,

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:51.960
 and it's never really been clear

1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:55.760
 what at a behavioral level triggers the release of GnRH.

1:51:55.760 --> 1:51:57.520
 There's all the stories about pheromones

1:51:57.520 --> 1:51:59.320
 and timers and puberty, et cetera,

1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:02.440
 but environmental conditions and dietary conditions

1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:05.040
 and behaviors that can control GnRH release,

1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.040
 I think is an incredible area for exploration.

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:12.480
 I'd love to do that sabbatical, by the way.

1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:16.200
 I have a couple seemingly random questions,

1:52:16.200 --> 1:52:18.520
 but I can't help but ask because one thing I like to do

1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:21.320
 is forage the internet for practices

1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:23.640
 that at least more than a few people are doing

1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:26.440
 and then wonder whether or not there's any basis for it.

1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:31.520
 You mentioned methylation as a detrimental process,

1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:33.840
 the way it disrupts the epigenome,

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:36.540
 the CD reader, so to speak.

1:52:36.540 --> 1:52:40.320
 There are people out there who are ingesting methylene blue.

1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:41.560
 And when I was a kid,

1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:44.580
 I used methylene blue to clean my fish tank.

1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:45.840
 And I love fish tanks.

1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:47.700
 I know you're into aquaria also.

1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.940
 A different podcast episode, talk about aquaria,

1:52:50.940 --> 1:52:55.940
 but why in the world would people ingest methylene blue?

1:52:56.040 --> 1:52:58.320
 Meaning, is their logic correct

1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:01.160
 and or is that a dangerous practice?

1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:04.160
 I'm not sure I'd want to ingest methylene blue.

1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:06.440
 Sounds like a bad thing to do.

1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:07.640
 It stains your body.

1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:09.720
 You've seen these people turn blue.

1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:13.400
 Yeah, there was someone in my lab as a postdoc

1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:16.380
 was using it to study a completely different process

1:53:16.380 --> 1:53:17.560
 related to the blood brain barrier

1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:20.480
 and used to inject into animals and they would turn blue.

1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:22.960
 But then again, people ingest colloid silver.

1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:23.800
 You know, they'll put in there.

1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:25.840
 There's this, please, people don't do this.

1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:29.920
 Or if you do, just don't tell me because I won't like it.

1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:32.220
 They, people put it in their eyes

1:53:32.220 --> 1:53:34.520
 and some people actually stain their skin.

1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:35.880
 They actually become kind of a,

1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:39.640
 this silver, purple, brown color if they do it excessively.

1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:42.040
 I mean, there's a lot of crazy stuff out there,

1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:44.360
 but what do you think they're thinking

1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:45.600
 with this methylene blue thing

1:53:45.600 --> 1:53:48.040
 or should we just get them to a good psychiatrist?

1:53:50.140 --> 1:53:51.740
 I don't know for sure.

1:53:51.740 --> 1:53:53.880
 I think methylene blue was found to extend the lifespan

1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:56.760
 of some lower organism and that's where it came from.

1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:58.200
 My recollection with the-

1:53:58.200 --> 1:53:59.800
 This is on lower organisms.

1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:02.400
 Yes, smaller organisms.

1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:04.360
 I think, doesn't, do you remember, Andrew,

1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:07.680
 does it interrupt or interfere with mitochondrial activity

1:54:07.680 --> 1:54:09.740
 and that's why we're doing it.

1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:13.020
 Yeah, we need to look this up and post it.

1:54:13.020 --> 1:54:14.440
 We'll get to the bottom of this.

1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:17.400
 But those methyls, let's talk about those.

1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:18.760
 Those methyls have to be placed

1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:21.240
 on the right part of the genome.

1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:23.320
 They get attached to the right genes and the wrong genes.

1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:26.080
 And if you have a lot of methylation,

1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:28.680
 it's going to mess up the epigenome.

1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:32.320
 Smoking will do that, lack of exercise, all that good stuff.

1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:34.820
 So what you actually want to do is you want to measure it

1:54:34.820 --> 1:54:38.240
 and make sure what you're doing with your body is working.

1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:40.000
 How do you know that if you do this

1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:41.960
 or that is actually helping?

1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:43.640
 And so you can test your age.

1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:45.800
 I could take a swab from your mouth

1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:48.160
 and tell you how old you are biologically,

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:50.400
 and then we could work on trying to bring that down.

1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:53.440
 And actually, there are anecdotes now

1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:56.240
 that people are reversing their age by a decade or more

1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:00.300
 just by doing some of the things that we've talked about

1:55:00.300 --> 1:55:02.200
 and some other cutting-edge stuff

1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.580
 that I'm going to write about.

1:55:05.460 --> 1:55:07.280
 But yeah, but you have to measure stuff.

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.580
 I didn't want to forget to bring that up.

1:55:10.580 --> 1:55:11.920
 I'm measuring stuff all the time.

1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:14.080
 I have blood tests like you.

1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:16.480
 I've got this monitor that's stuck to my chest right now

1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:18.940
 that's measuring myself 1,000 times a second.

1:55:18.940 --> 1:55:20.640
 And I measure my biological age.

1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.840
 What's it measuring 1,000 times a second?

1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:24.020
 A huge host of things?

1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:24.860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.640
 So this little device is stuck here,

1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:27.860
 and it's for two weeks.

1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:30.760
 You just recharge it or send it back and get a new one.

1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:34.600
 It's got body temperature movement, heart rate variability.

1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:36.300
 It's an FDA-approved device.

1:55:36.300 --> 1:55:37.140
 It's not a toy.

1:55:37.140 --> 1:55:40.520
 It's not one of these recreational things.

1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:42.440
 It also listens to my voice.

1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:44.720
 Eventually, it'll tell me if I need a psychiatrist

1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:46.380
 or if I'm depressed.

1:55:47.380 --> 1:55:49.640
 It will tell me how I sleep, obviously.

1:55:49.640 --> 1:55:51.040
 But when you put all that data together

1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:53.220
 and it's individualized and anonymized,

1:55:53.220 --> 1:55:56.880
 it can now tell my doctor in real time

1:55:56.880 --> 1:55:59.320
 if I've got a cold that needs an antibiotic

1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:01.100
 or it's just a virus,

1:56:01.100 --> 1:56:06.100
 if I am suffering from COVID-19,

1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:09.780
 or even if I'm going to have a heart attack next week.

1:56:09.780 --> 1:56:11.000
 And so these little devices

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.320
 are going to be with us all the time

1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:14.880
 instead of going to your doctor once a year,

1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:16.040
 which is ludicrous.

1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:19.860
 I have to ask you about X-rays

1:56:19.860 --> 1:56:22.260
 because every time I go through the scanner at the airport,

1:56:22.260 --> 1:56:24.820
 I think Sinclair would never do this.

1:56:24.820 --> 1:56:27.860
 And the argument I heard you give about this before

1:56:27.860 --> 1:56:29.080
 was a really excellent one,

1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:33.800
 which is that it's a low level amount of radiation

1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:35.160
 going through at the airport,

1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:37.000
 but the argument is always,

1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.700
 well, it's just as much as on the plane.

1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:41.640
 And your argument, your counterargument, I should say,

1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:45.080
 was, well, then why would I want to do both, right?

1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:47.160
 So when you go to the airport,

1:56:47.160 --> 1:56:48.560
 assuming you're not running late

1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.600
 and you have to go through the standard line,

1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:52.560
 what do you say to them?

1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:54.160
 Do you say, I'm David Sinclair,

1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:56.840
 and then they shuttle you to your own line?

1:56:56.840 --> 1:56:57.680
 What do you say?

1:56:57.680 --> 1:56:59.400
 You do say, I don't like this thing.

1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:01.580
 Do you have to give them a reason?

1:57:01.580 --> 1:57:02.420
 No, you don't.

1:57:02.420 --> 1:57:04.440
 You can say, I don't want this,

1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:05.360
 and they'll get annoyed

1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:08.260
 because it's hard for them to pat you down,

1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:09.760
 but you get a pat down and you're done.

1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:12.480
 As long as you're not in a hurry, it's fine.

1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:14.840
 If you want to pay for the TSA Pre in America

1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:17.320
 or the way to get around those scanners, you can do that.

1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:20.080
 So I travel a lot, so it's worth it anyway.

1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:21.660
 But I just go through the metal detector.

1:57:21.660 --> 1:57:22.880
 I don't get scanned.

1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:26.440
 And the metal detector doesn't have the same problem.

1:57:26.440 --> 1:57:28.400
 And what about x-rays at the dentist?

1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:29.240
 Yeah.

1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:31.200
 Well, you know, one x-ray is not going to kill you.

1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:32.360
 Two is not going to kill you.

1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:33.680
 But I'd rather- Three will kill you.

1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:35.300
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:57:35.300 --> 1:57:38.040
 I try to limit it because it's cumulative.

1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:42.840
 And I went for six years without having a dental x-ray.

1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:45.080
 And then my last visit, I just gave up.

1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:47.400
 I was tired of arguing with my dentist.

1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:48.260
 So they gave me one,

1:57:48.260 --> 1:57:50.080
 but they've got lead coats on

1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:52.360
 and they put lead all over your body.

1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:54.400
 That's telling you something right there.

1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:58.440
 And funnily enough, my teeth hadn't changed.

1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:00.260
 Now, you could balance that by saying,

1:58:00.260 --> 1:58:02.440
 well, one x-ray, two x-rays, three x-rays

1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:04.640
 is worth it if I have cavities.

1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:05.480
 And that's true.

1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:07.260
 You want to know what's in there.

1:58:07.260 --> 1:58:10.320
 But doing it regularly, for me,

1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:11.600
 I don't think was worth it

1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:13.160
 because my teeth were in perfect health

1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:14.680
 and have always been.

1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:16.220
 Don't have any cavities.

1:58:16.220 --> 1:58:17.060
 Didn't have braces.

1:58:17.060 --> 1:58:17.880
 They're fine.

1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:18.840
 Don't stop scanning me.

1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:20.600
 I mean, I know you have to pay for the machine,

1:58:20.600 --> 1:58:22.440
 but do I have a choice?

1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:23.280
 Yes.

1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:24.800
 So stop pressuring me.

1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:26.920
 You know, who shared your sentiments about x-rays

1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:28.600
 and the dentist in general,

1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:30.720
 my apologies to the dentists out there,

1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:32.880
 was the great physicist, Richard Feynman.

1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:34.960
 This is a story about him

1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:36.480
 that's not especially well-known,

1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:41.480
 but he had very serious health concerns about x-rays

1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:44.160
 because he understood the physics

1:58:44.160 --> 1:58:45.560
 and he understood enough biology

1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:47.880
 that he was actually quite vocal

1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:52.720
 about his dislike of dental technology and its dangers.

1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:54.520
 And he talked about some of that.

1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:58.600
 People can find that on the internet if they like.

1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:02.680
 Speaking of people who are like Feynman,

1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:06.140
 who've been engaged in public discourse about science,

1:59:06.140 --> 1:59:07.920
 one of the things that I appreciate about you,

1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:10.040
 in fact, the way that you and I

1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:11.980
 initially came to know one another

1:59:11.980 --> 1:59:15.840
 is through your public health education efforts.

1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:19.320
 So obviously we're doing this podcast.

1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:22.960
 You've done the Joe Rogan podcast, Lex Friedman's podcast.

1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:24.660
 Excuse me, Lex, I'm still adjusting that.

1:59:24.660 --> 1:59:28.860
 Lex Friedman podcast and many other podcasts.

1:59:28.860 --> 1:59:30.360
 You've written an amazing book.

1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:33.140
 What are you thinking these days

1:59:33.140 --> 1:59:35.760
 in terms of what the world needs

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:39.480
 in terms of education from scientists,

1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:43.160
 education from MDs, education in general

1:59:43.160 --> 1:59:44.320
 as it relates to these things?

1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:47.240
 Because I think if nothing else,

1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:50.640
 2020 revealed to us that there's a gap.

1:59:50.640 --> 1:59:52.480
 There's a gap in understanding

1:59:52.480 --> 1:59:54.360
 and that the scientists too are guilty

1:59:54.360 --> 1:59:57.960
 of not knowing what to do with all the information

1:59:57.960 --> 1:59:59.920
 that's out there on PubMed or elsewhere.

1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:03.240
 Just what are you thinking for yourself?

2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:04.880
 And in general, I'd like to just know

2:00:04.880 --> 2:00:06.360
 what do you think the world needs there?

2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:09.680
 Maybe we can recruit some more public educators.

2:00:09.680 --> 2:00:12.880
 Yeah, well, we've gone from a time

2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:16.780
 when you and I were in college and young professors

2:00:16.780 --> 2:00:20.000
 where the only way to get our voice out to the public

2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.100
 was either through a newspaper

2:00:22.100 --> 2:00:24.740
 or a very short radio interview,

2:00:24.740 --> 2:00:27.800
 which for me was extremely frustrating

2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:31.060
 because particularly the newspapers and my topic

2:00:31.060 --> 2:00:32.760
 every time was twisted into something

2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:34.520
 that was not just embarrassing,

2:00:34.520 --> 2:00:37.360
 but Harvard University used to bring me into the back office

2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:39.040
 and slap my wrist. Frankenstein.

2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:40.560
 How did you say such a thing?

2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:42.940
 We're all gonna live 200, I didn't say that.

2:00:42.940 --> 2:00:45.600
 So we're now also in a world

2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:47.640
 where we're overwhelmed with information

2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:49.800
 and most of it is wrong

2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:52.180
 and anyone can pretend to be an expert.

2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:56.760
 So we've gone from early days to now, the future,

2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:58.800
 and we're experiencing it right now

2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:01.320
 thanks to guys like you, people like you,

2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:03.160
 is that the experts, some experts,

2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:07.520
 a small number who are brilliant and good communicators

2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:09.360
 are talking directly to the public.

2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:12.160
 This has never been able to be possible

2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:15.480
 until this time right now.

2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:19.520
 So another five years from now, and certainly by 10 years,

2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:23.160
 I would hope that there are trusted sources of information

2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:28.160
 of people who cannot just communicate the ideas directly,

2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:31.720
 but are able to talk about things that are going on

2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:33.720
 that aren't even published yet to say,

2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:35.660
 here's what's really going on

2:01:35.660 --> 2:01:37.960
 and this is what the future looks like.

2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.560
 But this is somebody like yourself

2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:42.920
 who spent their whole life studying a particular topic

2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:45.320
 and knows what they're talking about.

2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:46.880
 And this is also something

2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:49.480
 that I think most people don't know,

2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:53.260
 that we scientists, if we tell a lie, we burst into flames.

2:01:53.260 --> 2:01:56.920
 We absolutely cannot tell something that's untrue

2:01:56.920 --> 2:01:59.840
 and to the best of our knowledge, we say it as it is

2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:02.440
 because if we don't, we're beaten up

2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:04.440
 or we kicked out of the university.

2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:06.720
 So the people who survived to our age,

2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:07.780
 and I'm a little older than you,

2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:09.380
 so I've survived a bit longer.

2:02:09.380 --> 2:02:11.080
 But a lot younger inside.

2:02:11.080 --> 2:02:13.680
 No, but we have to measure you with my stroke test.

2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:15.880
 I probably need a little help, but hopefully not too much.

2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:19.460
 We'll measure that and we'll work on your eating.

2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:21.240
 But this is really, really important

2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:23.720
 is that finally people like you

2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:26.920
 are allowed by our universities to talk to the public.

2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.720
 I used to do it with a real threat,

2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:30.640
 to my survival.

2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:31.520
 People would look at me,

2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:33.680
 oh, he's a salesman, he's promoting this and that.

2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:35.400
 It was seen as a real negative.

2:02:35.400 --> 2:02:36.680
 But finally, I think we're in a world

2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:38.560
 where it's not negative anymore.

2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:42.300
 And the pandemic showed that we needed voices of reason,

2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:45.420
 voices of fact that you could trust.

2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:48.480
 And you can see the popularity of your podcast

2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:52.060
 shows that the public are desperate for facts

2:02:52.060 --> 2:02:52.900
 that they can trust

2:02:52.900 --> 2:02:55.680
 because they don't know what to believe anymore.

2:02:55.680 --> 2:02:59.460
 Well, I am being completely honest when I say this

2:02:59.460 --> 2:03:01.240
 that I followed your lead.

2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:04.680
 I saw you on the Joe Rogan podcast and my jaw dropped.

2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:07.240
 I was like, this is amazing.

2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:10.000
 Because he had other good scientists on before,

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.020
 but your tenured professor, Harvard genetics,

2:03:13.020 --> 2:03:14.660
 department of genetics.

2:03:14.660 --> 2:03:16.400
 And for those of you who don't know,

2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:20.400
 there's Harvard and of course Harvard Medical School,

2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:22.480
 and they're both excellent, of course,

2:03:23.580 --> 2:03:26.360
 but these are the top, top tiers of academia.

2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:27.880
 And I certainly understand what it takes

2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:29.240
 to get there and survive there

2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:30.680
 and to thrive there.

2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:32.320
 It's like a game of pinball.

2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:33.160
 You never win.

2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:35.680
 You just get to, if you're doing really well,

2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:36.600
 you get to keep playing.

2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:38.600
 That's the truth in academia.

2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:40.920
 And if you're not, you stop playing basically.

2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:45.040
 But when I saw you explain what you were doing

2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:47.000
 in a way that was accessible to people

2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.640
 and also talking about possible protocols

2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:51.280
 that they might explore for themselves

2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:53.840
 to see if those were right for them,

2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:57.080
 I was just dazzled and excited.

2:03:57.080 --> 2:03:59.400
 And I made every effort to get in contact with you

2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:02.240
 and the rest is history.

2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:05.620
 But I think what's really exciting to me these days

2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:08.320
 is because of 2020 and everything that's happened

2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:12.240
 and it continues to happen, there's a thirst for knowledge.

2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:15.380
 There's also this direct to the public route

2:04:15.380 --> 2:04:16.640
 that you mentioned.

2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:19.920
 And I think there's also an openness,

2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:21.720
 I'd love your thoughts on this,

2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:24.500
 but it seems to me that there's an openness

2:04:24.500 --> 2:04:28.800
 from the general public about health practices,

2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:30.720
 that there are actually things that people can do

2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:34.480
 to control their stress level, to control their sleep,

2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:36.460
 to control their cholesterol,

2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:39.020
 if that's what they need to do, maybe they don't,

2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:41.800
 and to even control their lifespan,

2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:43.780
 which I think is remarkable.

2:04:43.780 --> 2:04:47.040
 And I know I speak on behalf of so many people

2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:48.640
 when I just, I want to say thank you.

2:04:48.640 --> 2:04:51.300
 You've truly changed the course of my life.

2:04:51.300 --> 2:04:53.240
 I would not be sitting here doing this

2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:55.320
 were it not for your example.

2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:58.720
 And I always say, Sinclair, many people have written books,

2:04:58.720 --> 2:05:01.160
 many academics have written books as you have,

2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:02.720
 but in terms of doing podcasts

2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:04.380
 and really getting out there with your message

2:05:04.380 --> 2:05:07.100
 in a way that I have to assume raised your cortisol level

2:05:07.100 --> 2:05:08.800
 and heart rate just a little bit,

2:05:09.740 --> 2:05:11.360
 but you did it nonetheless.

2:05:12.580 --> 2:05:14.680
 You know, you were truly first man in

2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:17.220
 and that deserves a nod

2:05:17.220 --> 2:05:19.840
 and I have a great debt of gratitude to you for that.

2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:20.960
 So thank you so much.

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:23.300
 Thanks, Andrew, you've become a good friend

2:05:23.300 --> 2:05:25.240
 and I'm super proud of what you've done

2:05:25.240 --> 2:05:27.280
 and what you, I know what you will do.

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:29.040
 So in addition to your book

2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:31.220
 and your presence on social media,

2:05:31.220 --> 2:05:34.640
 Instagram and Twitter, and appearances on podcasts,

2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:37.800
 recently I've noticed that you've opened up

2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:41.600
 a sort of an email slash website that people can ask,

2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:44.680
 access, excuse me, to get some information

2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:46.780
 about their own health and rates of aging.

2:05:46.780 --> 2:05:49.440
 Tell us about that and what's being measured

2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:53.160
 and what is this test that you've been working on,

2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:56.520
 secretly and now soon not so secretly?

2:05:56.520 --> 2:06:00.440
 Yeah, well, what I want is a credit score for the body

2:06:00.440 --> 2:06:03.680
 to make it easy for people to follow their health.

2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:05.040
 And there is a number,

2:06:05.040 --> 2:06:06.960
 there's a biological age that you can measure.

2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:08.960
 Unfortunately, the test is many hundreds of dollars

2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:10.980
 right now, but in my lab,

2:06:10.980 --> 2:06:13.800
 we've been able to bring that down a lot.

2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:15.460
 And so I want to democratize this test

2:06:15.460 --> 2:06:18.120
 so that everybody has access to a score for their health

2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:22.080
 that can predict not just their future health

2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:24.800
 and time of death, but to change it.

2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:27.680
 And I'm building a system that will point people

2:06:27.680 --> 2:06:29.520
 in the right direction and give them discounts

2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:31.840
 for certain things that will improve

2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:33.600
 not just their health now,

2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:35.720
 but 10, 20, 30 years into the future.

2:06:35.720 --> 2:06:38.660
 And we can measure that and very cheaply keep measuring it

2:06:38.660 --> 2:06:40.420
 to know that you're on the right track.

2:06:40.420 --> 2:06:41.480
 Because if you don't measure something,

2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:43.040
 you can't optimize it.

2:06:43.040 --> 2:06:44.640
 And so this is the biological age test.

2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:45.480
 We've developed it.

2:06:45.480 --> 2:06:47.640
 It's a simple mouth swab.

2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:49.080
 We're rolling it out.

2:06:49.080 --> 2:06:51.000
 We're building the system right now.

2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:52.040
 And there is a signup sheet

2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:54.280
 because a lot of people want to get in line.

2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:56.000
 Go to drsinclair.com.

2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.760
 You can get on that and you'll be one of the first people

2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:01.280
 in the world to get this test and see what we're doing.

2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:03.200
 Oh, fantastic.

2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:08.000
 Will people be celebrating their biological age birthdays?

2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.640
 In other words, if I'm minus, like if I could imagine,

2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:12.620
 so I'm 45 right now, soon to be 46.

2:07:12.620 --> 2:07:14.400
 But if I were to be so lucky

2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:19.160
 is to get my biological age to 35 within 12 months,

2:07:19.160 --> 2:07:20.400
 maybe can help me do that.

2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:23.960
 Do I get to celebrate a negative birthday?

2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:24.800
 Absolutely.

2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:26.200
 And my plan is that those people

2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:29.380
 who take their age back a year or more,

2:07:29.380 --> 2:07:31.880
 we think we can go back 20 years eventually,

2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:33.280
 they'll get a birthday card from me

2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:35.800
 and it's a negative birthday card.

2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:36.700
 I love it.

2:07:36.700 --> 2:07:39.520
 And probably very little actual birthday cake

2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:41.360
 being ingested, but who cares?

2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:42.840
 Because you're living that much longer.

2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:45.120
 Well, it's full of stevia, that'll be fine.

2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:47.560
 And thank you for talking to us today.

2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:52.520
 I realized I took us down deep into the guts of mechanism

2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:55.960
 and as well, talking about global protocols,

2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:59.240
 everything from what one can do and take if they choose,

2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:01.160
 that's right for them,

2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:03.160
 to how to think about this whole process

2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:06.840
 that we talk about when we talk about lifespan,

2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:10.040
 as always incredibly illuminating.

2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:11.120
 Thank you, David.

2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:12.600
 Thanks, Andrew.

2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:14.560
 Thank you for joining me for my conversation

2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:16.360
 with Dr. David Sinclair.

2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:33.640
 you can leave us up to a five-star review

2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:35.560
 and you can leave us a comment.

2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:37.360
 Please also check out the sponsors mentioned

2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:38.500
 at the beginning of this episode.

2:08:38.500 --> 2:08:41.120
 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:43.600
 Also, I teach science and science-related tools

2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:46.160
 on Instagram, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram.

2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:48.720
 I also have a Twitter, which is also Huberman Lab.

2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:50.080
 So be sure to check those out.

2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:52.920
 A lot of the material covers things similar to the podcast,

2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:54.840
 but oftentimes I'll cover unique material

2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:56.820
 not featured at all on the podcast.

2:08:56.820 --> 2:09:00.040
 So that's Huberman Lab on Instagram and on Twitter.

2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:01.640
 In addition, we have a Patreon,

2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:04.280
 it's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:06.400
 and there you can support the podcast

2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:08.020
 at any level that you like.

2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.260
 Today and in many other previous episodes

2:09:10.260 --> 2:09:12.920
 of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.

2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:16.120
 While supplements aren't necessary or right for everybody,

2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:18.880
 many people derive tremendous benefit from supplements.

2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:22.120
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:25.040
 because Thorne supplements are the absolute highest quality

2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:27.140
 and the absolute highest precision,

2:09:27.140 --> 2:09:29.000
 meaning what you see listed on the bottle

2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:30.320
 is what's actually in the bottle,

2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.880
 which is not the case for many supplement companies

2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:33.720
 out there.

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:36.120
 Thorne is one of the partners of the Mayo Clinic

2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:37.400
 and all the major sports teams,

2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:39.440
 and so they really are very trusted,

2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:40.700
 very highest quality.

2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:42.960
 If you want to see the supplements that I personally take,

2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:46.800
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:48.440
 and there you'll see the supplements that I take.

2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:50.940
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements,

2:09:50.940 --> 2:09:53.080
 and if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:55.280
 through that portal, you'll also get 20% off

2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:57.160
 any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:02.160
 So again, it's thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman

2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:05.600
 to get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:07.840
 Also take note that the Lifespan podcast

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:10.080
 featuring Dr. David Sinclair as a host

2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:11.920
 launches Wednesday, January 5th.

2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:13.560
 You can find the first episode here

2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:15.400
 on the Huberman Lab podcast channel.

2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:17.760
 They also have their own independent channel.

2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:19.860
 You can find the link to that channel in the show notes,

2:10:19.860 --> 2:10:21.640
 so please go there, subscribe on YouTube,

2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:23.520
 also on Apple and Spotify.

2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:24.760
 I've seen these episodes.

2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:25.760
 They are phenomenal,

2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:28.600
 and you're going to learn a tremendous amount about aging

2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:30.560
 and how to slow and reverse aging

2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:33.840
 from the world expert himself, Dr. David Sinclair.

2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:35.960
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:37.920
 thank you for your interest in science.
