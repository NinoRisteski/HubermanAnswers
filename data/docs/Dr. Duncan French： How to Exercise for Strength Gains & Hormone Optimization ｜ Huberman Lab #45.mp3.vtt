00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.340
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.340 --> 00:13.260
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.260 --> 00:15.180
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.140
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Duncan French

00:18.140 --> 00:21.100
 as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.560
 Dr. French is the vice president of performance

00:23.560 --> 00:25.700
 at the UFC Performance Institute,

00:25.700 --> 00:27.920
 and he has over 20 years of experience

00:27.920 --> 00:31.280
 working with elite professional and Olympic athletes.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.600
 Prior to joining the UFC,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.700
 French was the director of performance science

00:34.700 --> 00:36.660
 at the University of Notre Dame.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.860
 And he has many, many quality peer-reviewed studies

00:39.860 --> 00:41.900
 to his name, exploring, for instance,

00:41.900 --> 00:44.220
 how the particular order of exercise,

00:44.220 --> 00:46.460
 whether or not one performs endurance exercise

00:46.460 --> 00:49.320
 prior to resistance training or vice versa,

00:49.320 --> 00:52.440
 how that impacts performance of various movements

00:52.440 --> 00:54.300
 and endurance training protocols,

00:54.300 --> 00:56.180
 as well as the impact on hormones,

00:56.180 --> 00:58.340
 such as testosterone, estrogen,

00:58.340 --> 01:00.940
 and some of the stress hormones, such as cortisol.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.700
 He's also done fascinating work

01:02.700 --> 01:04.980
 exploring how neurotransmitters,

01:04.980 --> 01:06.940
 things like dopamine and epinephrine,

01:06.940 --> 01:09.300
 also called adrenaline, can impact hormones,

01:09.300 --> 01:13.060
 and how hormones can impact neurotransmitter release.

01:13.060 --> 01:15.700
 What's particularly unique about Dr. French's work

01:15.700 --> 01:19.060
 is that he's figured out specific training protocols

01:19.060 --> 01:22.260
 that can maximize, for instance, testosterone output

01:22.260 --> 01:24.820
 or reduce stress hormone output

01:24.820 --> 01:27.700
 in order to maximize the effects of training

01:27.700 --> 01:30.640
 in the short term and in the long term.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.980
 So today you're going to learn a lot of protocols,

01:32.980 --> 01:34.580
 whether or not you're into resistance training

01:34.580 --> 01:36.860
 or endurance training, you will learn, for instance,

01:36.860 --> 01:40.140
 how to regulate the duration of your training

01:40.140 --> 01:42.340
 and the type of training that you do

01:42.340 --> 01:44.100
 in order to get the maximum benefit

01:44.100 --> 01:46.180
 from that training over time.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.620
 So whether or not you are somebody

01:47.620 --> 01:50.780
 who just exercises recreationally for your health,

01:50.780 --> 01:53.620
 whether or not you're an amateur or professional athlete,

01:53.620 --> 01:56.160
 or whether or not you're just trying to maximize your health

01:56.160 --> 01:59.500
 through the use of endurance and or resistance training,

01:59.500 --> 02:02.840
 today's discussion will have a wealth of takeaways for you.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.100
 There are only a handful of people

02:04.100 --> 02:07.460
 working at the intersection of elite performance,

02:07.460 --> 02:10.760
 mechanistic science, and that can do so in a way

02:10.760 --> 02:14.220
 that leads to direct, immediately applicable protocols

02:14.220 --> 02:16.020
 that anybody can benefit from.

02:16.020 --> 02:19.460
 Dr. French also provides some incredibly important insights

02:19.460 --> 02:22.020
 about the direction that sport and exercise

02:22.020 --> 02:23.740
 are taking in the world today

02:23.740 --> 02:27.180
 and their applications towards performance and health.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.180
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

02:29.180 --> 02:31.260
 that this podcast is separate from my teaching

02:31.260 --> 02:32.960
 and research roles at Stanford.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.100
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:35.100 --> 02:38.020
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:38.020 --> 02:40.900
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.020
 In keeping with that theme,

02:42.020 --> 02:44.900
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.800
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.940
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

02:48.940 --> 02:51.160
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.460
 I've spent my career working on the visual system,

02:53.460 --> 02:55.380
 and I can tell you that everything about the way

02:55.380 --> 02:58.280
 that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed

02:58.280 --> 03:00.260
 was with performance in mind.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.060
 First of all, they're extremely lightweight,

03:02.060 --> 03:03.600
 so you actually forget that you're wearing them

03:03.600 --> 03:04.540
 most of the time.

03:04.540 --> 03:07.020
 Second of all, even if you get sweaty,

03:07.020 --> 03:08.900
 if you're running or biking or it's a hot day

03:08.900 --> 03:11.180
 or running around, just happen to be perspiring quite a lot,

03:11.180 --> 03:13.220
 they don't slip off your face, which is terrific.

03:13.220 --> 03:14.460
 They also have a great aesthetic

03:14.460 --> 03:16.940
 and they have a lot of different styles to choose from.

03:16.940 --> 03:19.060
 The clarity of the lenses is superb.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.420
 I don't think there's a match for the clarity

03:21.420 --> 03:22.600
 of Roca glasses out there,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.700
 and if there is, I'm not aware of it.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.660
 They are absolutely crystal clear,

03:26.660 --> 03:28.120
 and that's true in any environment,

03:28.120 --> 03:29.780
 whether or not you're working in a dim environment

03:29.780 --> 03:33.140
 or a bright environment, the clarity is unmatched.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.860
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,

03:35.860 --> 03:39.820
 you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.740
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off

03:42.740 --> 03:44.140
 your first order.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.340
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

03:47.340 --> 03:49.360
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

03:49.360 --> 03:52.060
 that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.620
 All of us have unique sleep needs,

03:53.620 --> 03:57.020
 and we should be sleeping on a mattress that's ideal for us.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.380
 If you go to the Helix site,

03:58.380 --> 04:00.100
 they have a quick two-minute quiz,

04:00.100 --> 04:01.180
 asks you a number of questions

04:01.180 --> 04:02.600
 about whether or not you sleep on your side,

04:02.600 --> 04:03.440
 your back, your stomach,

04:03.440 --> 04:05.580
 do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.100
 Maybe you don't have the answers to those questions,

04:07.100 --> 04:08.060
 which is fine.

04:08.060 --> 04:09.380
 They'll match you to the mattress

04:09.380 --> 04:11.720
 that's ideal for your sleep needs.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.420
 I took that quiz and about 10 months ago,

04:13.420 --> 04:16.060
 I started sleeping on the Dusk Helix mattress,

04:16.060 --> 04:17.380
 that's D-U-S-K.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.020
 That's the mattress that's ideal for me,

04:19.020 --> 04:21.600
 and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.380
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

04:23.380 --> 04:26.140
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

04:26.140 --> 04:27.620
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

04:27.620 --> 04:29.440
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress,

04:29.440 --> 04:32.540
 and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders

04:32.540 --> 04:33.780
 and two free pillows.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.580
 That's helixsleep.com slash Huberman.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.340
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.840
 Headspace is a meditation app

04:40.840 --> 04:43.540
 that's backed by 25 published studies.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.600
 By now, I think most people have heard about

04:45.600 --> 04:48.280
 or experienced the benefits of meditation.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.160
 Improved focus, better sleep, reduced stress,

04:51.160 --> 04:52.820
 more creativity and insight.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.060
 There's just so many studies out there

04:54.060 --> 04:55.780
 that support those claims.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.200
 The challenge, however, is sticking

04:57.200 --> 04:58.640
 to a meditation practice.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.100
 And over the years, I confess there have been times

05:01.100 --> 05:03.740
 when I've meditated regularly and then I stopped meditating,

05:03.740 --> 05:05.660
 even though it always provides benefits for me

05:05.660 --> 05:08.240
 the first time I do it and every time I do it.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.700
 With the Headspace app,

05:09.700 --> 05:11.960
 it makes it very easy to meditate consistently

05:11.960 --> 05:14.200
 because they have different types of meditations

05:14.200 --> 05:16.960
 to select from and they come in different duration.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.280
 So sometimes I only have three or four minutes to meditate.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.240
 They have those sorts of meditations.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.240
 They also have longer meditations of 20 minutes or more.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.400
 If you want to try Headspace,

05:25.400 --> 05:28.480
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.120
 And if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial

05:31.120 --> 05:33.460
 with Headspace's full library of meditations

05:33.460 --> 05:35.780
 that you can use in any situation.

05:35.780 --> 05:38.000
 This is the best deal offered by Headspace right now.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.120
 So again, if you're interested,

05:39.120 --> 05:42.400
 go to headspace.com slash special offer.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.900
 And now my conversation with Dr. Duncan French.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.960
 Duncan French, great to see you again.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.680
 Likewise, likewise, thank you.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.200
 I don't often have many Stanford professors

05:52.200 --> 05:54.840
 in the Performance Institute, so I'm really excited.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.240
 Oh, well, this place is amazing

05:56.240 --> 06:00.760
 and you have a huge role in making it what it is.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.920
 The reason I'm so excited to talk with you

06:02.920 --> 06:06.640
 is that you're one of these rare beasts

06:06.640 --> 06:09.820
 that you have been involved in human performance

06:09.820 --> 06:13.800
 and athletic performance at the collegiate level.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.920
 You are obviously very involved in MMA now

06:16.920 --> 06:18.820
 and the UFC Performance Institute.

06:18.820 --> 06:21.820
 And you also had the fortunate experience,

06:21.820 --> 06:25.000
 I like to think, of doing a PhD in,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.840
 what exactly was the PhD in?

06:26.840 --> 06:27.880
 It was exercise physiology.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.720
 Exercise physiology.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.440
 So you're familiar also with designing studies,

06:31.440 --> 06:34.260
 control groups, all the sorts of things that,

06:34.260 --> 06:36.220
 in my opinion anyway, are kind of lacking

06:36.220 --> 06:41.220
 from the internet social media version of exercise science,

06:41.680 --> 06:43.640
 which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas

06:43.640 --> 06:44.960
 about how people should be training,

06:44.960 --> 06:46.520
 what they should be doing and eating

06:46.520 --> 06:48.200
 and not eating and doing.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.640
 And certainly science doesn't have all the answers,

06:50.640 --> 06:52.740
 but I just think it's so rare to find somebody

06:52.740 --> 06:56.920
 that's at the convergence of all those different fields.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.880
 And so I have a lot of questions for you today

06:58.880 --> 07:00.280
 that I'm sure the audience

07:00.280 --> 07:01.680
 are going to be really interested in it.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.440
 Well, listen, I mean, I appreciate that.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.280
 It's very humbling.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.280
 And yeah, I've worked hard to get to where I am,

07:07.280 --> 07:08.920
 but I've always tried to be authentic.

07:08.920 --> 07:13.920
 And I think authenticity comes alongside academic rigor

07:14.240 --> 07:18.040
 and objectivity and insight and knowledge base, right?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.840
 At the end of the day, it's about having confidence,

07:20.840 --> 07:23.560
 having expertise and being able to deliver that expertise

07:23.560 --> 07:25.560
 to, in my world, to athletes.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.720
 And I think that's what I've always tried to do.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.800
 I've tried to have many strings to my bow

07:30.800 --> 07:34.680
 so that I can talk with many different hats on.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.960
 One day I'm talking to a coach,

07:35.960 --> 07:37.160
 the next day I'm talking to an athlete,

07:37.160 --> 07:38.760
 the next day I'm talking to a CEO,

07:38.760 --> 07:42.360
 the next day I'm talking to an academic professor.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.520
 So I think being able to wear those different hats

07:45.520 --> 07:48.400
 is certainly a skillset that I've tried to build

07:48.400 --> 07:49.240
 throughout my career.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.840
 And like I said, I've been blessed to work with,

07:51.840 --> 07:55.020
 I think it was 36 different professional or Olympic sports

07:55.020 --> 07:56.720
 last time I counted.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.880
 So yeah, it's been a wild ride.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.720
 It's been great.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.620
 Which of those sports was the most unusual?

08:02.620 --> 08:05.600
 I've worked with crown green bowling,

08:05.600 --> 08:07.080
 which I don't know, as an American guy,

08:07.080 --> 08:08.920
 I don't know how well you know that,

08:08.920 --> 08:13.920
 but basically imagine a 20 foot by 20 foot square of turf

08:15.740 --> 08:18.680
 with a small raise in the middle, i.e. the crown.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.200
 So it slopes to the edges.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.400
 And then you throw out a white jack, a smaller ball,

08:25.400 --> 08:27.960
 and then you roll out larger balls

08:27.960 --> 08:30.000
 to try and get closest to the jack.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.560
 It's a very European thing, let's say.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.600
 But yeah, sports performance at crown green bowling,

08:35.600 --> 08:36.440
 there you go.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.040
 All right, wow.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.320
 And then to a mixed martial arts fighter

08:41.320 --> 08:42.760
 and everything in between.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.520
 So along those lines,

08:44.520 --> 08:46.600
 could you give us a little bit of your background?

08:46.600 --> 08:47.480
 Where'd you start out?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.040
 Where are you from originally?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.280
 Yeah, I'm from the Northeast of England.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.160
 So I'm from a town called Harrogate, which is in Yorkshire,

08:54.160 --> 08:56.440
 which is a Northern kind of area of the UK.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.760
 Nice sunny weather all year long.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.480
 Yeah, you can imagine, yeah,

09:00.480 --> 09:03.720
 with the two weeks of summer that we get, you know.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.400
 But yeah, I mean, I did my undergraduate studies there

09:06.400 --> 09:07.440
 in sports science.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.840
 I did teacher training

09:08.840 --> 09:11.440
 to be a physical education teacher after that.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.160
 Like most people, I then worked as a high school

09:14.160 --> 09:15.720
 physical education teacher.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.720
 You know, great experience working with kids,

09:17.720 --> 09:21.180
 developing athletic qualities,

09:21.180 --> 09:23.600
 but something in the back of my mind always,

09:23.600 --> 09:24.440
 I wanted more.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.840
 I wanted to be at the higher end of elite sport.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.520
 You know, I was a failed athlete like many people.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.120
 I represented my country in different sports and things,

09:33.120 --> 09:34.920
 but I never made it professionally.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.200
 So, you know, that little seed was sown in as much

09:40.200 --> 09:42.600
 as I then started to reach out to, you know,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.760
 to different areas to do a PhD,

09:44.760 --> 09:46.880
 whether it was in the UK or also, you know,

09:46.880 --> 09:48.120
 chance my arm took a punt,

09:48.120 --> 09:49.760
 see if we could get over to the States.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.480
 All my buddies were going on, you know,

09:51.480 --> 09:54.200
 gap years after the Finnish university or whatever,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.960
 and going to Bali and hanging out or whatever,

09:56.960 --> 09:58.000
 traveling through Thailand.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.440
 And I figured, well, you know,

09:59.440 --> 10:00.720
 I've always loved the States

10:00.720 --> 10:02.600
 and can I go and kill two birds with one stone

10:02.600 --> 10:05.240
 and do something academic, continue my studies,

10:05.240 --> 10:06.760
 but also do it in a different environment

10:06.760 --> 10:08.560
 and get some life experience.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.080
 And then many, many rejections,

10:11.080 --> 10:14.360
 as I'm sure you're kind of aware from different professors,

10:14.360 --> 10:16.360
 whether it was Roger Naranoka or, you know,

10:16.360 --> 10:17.200
 William Cramer or whatever.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.160
 So you just wrote to these folks?

10:18.160 --> 10:21.640
 I just cold called and sent out information and saying,

10:21.640 --> 10:24.600
 yeah, so have you got any opportunities?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.240
 Pushed back from them all, but you know,

10:26.240 --> 10:28.200
 dogged and kept asking.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.280
 And yeah, Dr. William Cramer,

10:30.280 --> 10:33.520
 who was at Ball State University in Indiana at the time,

10:33.520 --> 10:36.040
 you know, a muscle neuroendocrinologist

10:36.040 --> 10:38.000
 and researcher in muscle physiology

10:38.000 --> 10:39.360
 using resistance training.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
 You know, he basically said,

10:41.320 --> 10:42.720
 listen, I can guarantee you funding

10:42.720 --> 10:44.960
 for the first year of your studies, but not the next three.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.200
 Sounds like a typical academic response.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.240
 I can take care of you, but not that well necessarily.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.560
 Yeah, so spoke to my parents and said,

10:52.560 --> 10:54.480
 hey, can we take a punt?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.320
 And they, you know, they were great in supporting me.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.640
 And yeah, long story short,

10:57.640 --> 11:00.960
 came out to begin my PhD at Ball State.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.640
 After a year, Dr. Cramer transferred to Yukon,

11:03.640 --> 11:06.440
 you know, Connecticut in stores in the Northeast there.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.280
 And I transferred to him and with him.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.200
 And yeah, four great years with my PhD

11:11.200 --> 11:15.920
 and getting my PhD with a really prolific research group

11:15.920 --> 11:18.280
 that looked at, you know, neuroendocrinology,

11:18.280 --> 11:21.580
 hormonal work, but using a resistance training

11:21.580 --> 11:25.280
 primarily as an exercise stressor as a major mechanism.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.120
 And then looking at all the different physiologies

11:27.120 --> 11:28.720
 off the back of resistance training.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.700
 Yeah, you guys were enormously productive.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.960
 I found dozens of papers

11:33.960 --> 11:36.960
 on how weight training impacts hormones

11:36.960 --> 11:39.160
 and your name is on all of them.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.840
 And it's remarkable.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.200
 I have a question about this.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.320
 I'll just inject a question

11:44.320 --> 11:46.580
 about weight training and hormones.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.420
 You hear this all the time that doing these big,

11:48.420 --> 11:50.760
 heavy compound movements or resistance training

11:50.760 --> 11:53.440
 increases androgens, things like testosterone,

11:53.440 --> 11:55.360
 DHT, DHEA, and so forth.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.740
 Does anyone know how that actually happens?

11:58.740 --> 12:01.180
 Like what about move, what about in,

12:01.180 --> 12:05.120
 what is it about engaging motor neurons under heavy loads

12:05.120 --> 12:07.680
 sends a signal to the endocrine system,

12:07.680 --> 12:09.640
 hey, release testosterone.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.920
 I've never actually been able to find that in a textbook.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.240
 Yeah, well, I mean-

12:14.240 --> 12:15.520
 And how can I do more of that?

12:15.520 --> 12:18.400
 As much as I know, you know, and again,

12:18.400 --> 12:19.560
 I'm digging out into the annals

12:19.560 --> 12:21.400
 of Duncan French's kind of brain now,

12:21.400 --> 12:23.960
 but yeah, I mean, I think it's a stress response, right?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.140
 It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic stress.

12:26.140 --> 12:28.560
 And these are, you know, the downstream regulation

12:28.560 --> 12:31.360
 of testosterone release at the gonads

12:31.360 --> 12:34.000
 comes from many different areas.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.880
 You know, my work primarily looked at, you know,

12:37.880 --> 12:41.080
 catecholamines and sympathetic arousal.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.560
 So things like epinephrine, adrenalin.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.400
 Correct, yeah.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.240
 Epinephrine, adrenalin, you know, noradrenalin.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.060
 How they were signaling,

12:49.060 --> 12:50.920
 they're signaling cascade using, you know,

12:50.920 --> 12:54.520
 the HPA axis releasing cortisol.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.160
 And then, you know, looking at how that also influenced

12:57.160 --> 13:00.960
 the adrenal medulla to release, you know, androgens

13:00.960 --> 13:02.960
 and then signaling that at the gonads.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.400
 That raises an interesting question.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.940
 So in presumably weight training in women,

13:07.940 --> 13:10.080
 people who don't have testes,

13:10.080 --> 13:11.640
 also it increases testosterone.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.480
 Yes, yeah.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.020
 Is that purely through the adrenals?

13:14.020 --> 13:15.040
 When women lift weights,

13:15.040 --> 13:16.720
 their adrenal glands release testosterone?

13:16.720 --> 13:17.560
 Absolutely.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.880
 I mean, that is the only area

13:18.880 --> 13:21.400
 of testosterone release for females.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.560
 And yes, it's the same downstream cascade.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.320
 Obviously the extent to which it happens

13:25.320 --> 13:27.280
 is significantly less in females,

13:27.280 --> 13:29.560
 but that's how you, there's good data out there

13:29.560 --> 13:30.520
 that shows, you know,

13:30.520 --> 13:33.300
 females can increase their anabolic environment,

13:33.300 --> 13:35.480
 their internal anabolic milieu

13:35.480 --> 13:37.480
 using resistance training as a stressor.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.640
 And then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth,

13:40.640 --> 13:43.160
 you know, whether it's tendon, ligament, adaptations,

13:43.160 --> 13:46.320
 you know, the beneficial consequences of resistance training,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.800
 which is driven by anabolic stimuli.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.280
 Yeah, I have two questions about that.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.780
 The first one is something that you mentioned,

13:51.780 --> 13:55.220
 which is that the androgens, the testosterone

13:55.220 --> 13:58.360
 comes from the adrenals under resistance loads in women.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.040
 Is the same true in men?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.320
 I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone

14:02.320 --> 14:06.280
 when we weight train for men that have testes,

14:06.280 --> 14:10.720
 but do we know whether or not it's the adrenals

14:10.720 --> 14:13.160
 or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone?

14:13.160 --> 14:15.040
 More or both, a little bit from each?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.960
 The field is divided presently.

14:17.960 --> 14:21.960
 I mean, as much as understanding the acute adrenergic response

14:24.480 --> 14:28.000
 in terms of, you know, anabolic response to exercise

14:28.000 --> 14:31.400
 in an acute phase and the exposure to, you know,

14:31.400 --> 14:33.080
 a stimulus that is stress driven,

14:33.080 --> 14:35.360
 which might be partly from the adrenal glands,

14:35.360 --> 14:39.800
 partly from the gonads, versus a longitudinal exposure

14:39.800 --> 14:43.000
 to anabolic environments, which is primarily driven

14:43.000 --> 14:45.360
 by obviously the gonads and the release,

14:45.360 --> 14:47.800
 the endocrine environment from testosterone release

14:47.800 --> 14:48.740
 at the gonads.

14:48.740 --> 14:51.800
 So the field is split in terms of how exercise

14:51.800 --> 14:55.680
 is promoting hypertrophy, you know, muscle tissue growth,

14:55.680 --> 15:00.200
 and whether that is very much an adrenal stimuli

15:00.200 --> 15:02.880
 or if that's significant enough in these acute responses

15:02.880 --> 15:06.720
 versus the longitudinal exposure to elevated basal levels

15:06.720 --> 15:10.640
 of anabolic testosterone habitual level.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.440
 So it sounds like with most things it's probably both.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.600
 It's probably the adrenals and the gonads.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.780
 And then you mentioned that testosterone

15:17.780 --> 15:20.920
 can have enhancing effects or growth effects

15:20.920 --> 15:22.640
 on tendon and ligament also.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.120
 You don't often hear about that.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.800
 People always think, you know, testosterone muscle,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.960
 but testosterone has a lot of effects on other tissues

15:29.960 --> 15:32.680
 that are important for performance, it sounds like.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.520
 Could you?

15:33.520 --> 15:34.360
 What's the story there?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.000
 I mean, I think, you know, the testosterone hormone is,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.600
 I mean, listen, there's androgen receptors

15:40.600 --> 15:42.840
 on neural tissue, on neural axons.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.780
 Pretty much everywhere.

15:43.780 --> 15:44.620
 Exactly.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.100
 So, you know, the binding capacity of testosterone

15:47.100 --> 15:49.640
 and influence in different tissues within the body

15:49.640 --> 15:51.480
 are touched on, you know, muscle tissue,

15:51.480 --> 15:55.000
 but you know, the ligaments, the tendons, even bone,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.160
 to some extent, you know,

15:56.160 --> 15:59.440
 testosterone has potential to influence that

15:59.440 --> 16:02.360
 in terms of removing osteopenic kind of characteristics,

16:02.360 --> 16:03.200
 et cetera.

16:03.200 --> 16:08.200
 So yeah, it's a magic hormone, let's say,

16:08.560 --> 16:12.560
 with many, many end impacts in terms of adaptation.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.160
 I definitely want to get back to your trajectory,

16:15.160 --> 16:17.440
 but as long as we're on the interactions

16:17.440 --> 16:20.560
 between androgens, testosterone and its derivatives,

16:20.560 --> 16:22.620
 and different tissues, you know,

16:22.620 --> 16:25.000
 from the work that you did as a PhD student

16:25.000 --> 16:27.440
 and throughout your career,

16:27.440 --> 16:30.720
 could you say that there's some general principles

16:30.720 --> 16:33.500
 of training that favor testosterone production

16:33.500 --> 16:36.760
 in terms of, that somebody who's not an elite athlete

16:36.760 --> 16:38.920
 could use, somebody who's already adapted

16:38.920 --> 16:39.940
 to weight training somewhat,

16:39.940 --> 16:42.580
 like they know the difference between a dumbbell

16:42.580 --> 16:44.780
 and a barbell, and they know the various movements,

16:44.780 --> 16:46.000
 they're not going to damage themselves,

16:46.000 --> 16:47.920
 but once they're doing that, I mean,

16:47.920 --> 16:50.900
 I've heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions,

16:50.900 --> 16:54.040
 but in rep loads, now there's a lot of parameter space,

16:54.040 --> 16:57.800
 but if you were going to throw out some of the parameters

16:57.800 --> 17:00.400
 that you think are most important to pay attention to

17:00.400 --> 17:03.240
 for the typical person who's trying to use weight training

17:03.240 --> 17:07.080
 to build or maintain muscle, lose body fat,

17:07.080 --> 17:10.740
 so body recomposition, and or stay strong and healthy

17:10.740 --> 17:12.560
 for sport of a different kind.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.500
 Yeah, so the work that we obviously, you know,

17:14.500 --> 17:17.480
 I was exposed to back in my PhD,

17:17.480 --> 17:18.800
 it was a double-edged sword,

17:18.800 --> 17:21.100
 and as much as testosterone is really stimulated

17:21.100 --> 17:24.400
 by an intensity factor and also a volume factor.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.080
 Now, growth hormone is a little bit different.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.580
 That's largely driven by an intensity factor alone.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.420
 Oh, really?

17:29.420 --> 17:31.540
 I saw that the growth hormone was driven by volume,

17:31.540 --> 17:33.680
 which just goes to show you, no, no, no, no,

17:33.680 --> 17:34.520
 I think you're probably right,

17:34.520 --> 17:36.520
 which just goes to show you that most of what's out there

17:36.520 --> 17:40.380
 on the internet is completely, not only is it wrong,

17:40.380 --> 17:42.260
 it's usually backwards, so no, trust,

17:43.220 --> 17:44.200
 no, trust your instinct,

17:44.200 --> 17:47.940
 because I think people just make this stuff up, right?

17:47.940 --> 17:49.920
 Because it's very hard to measure growth hormone

17:49.920 --> 17:54.280
 and testosterone, and I can't imagine most of the stuff

17:54.280 --> 17:55.960
 that I see out there, they're taking drips

17:55.960 --> 17:58.920
 and, you know, measuring free versus bound

17:58.920 --> 17:59.760
 and all this kind of stuff,

17:59.760 --> 18:01.160
 but that's what you do in laboratories.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.360
 Right, yeah, you look at total composition

18:03.360 --> 18:04.320
 and you look at how much of that

18:04.320 --> 18:05.920
 is free circulating in the system,

18:05.920 --> 18:09.020
 how much is bound and therefore biologically active,

18:09.020 --> 18:11.960
 bound to receptor creating adaptation.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.640
 But yeah, coming back to testosterone

18:13.640 --> 18:15.640
 in terms of the training strategies,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.000
 it's largely driven by both an intensity

18:18.000 --> 18:19.200
 and a volume factor.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.600
 So if you look at many of the exercise interventions

18:22.600 --> 18:24.240
 that we use to try and investigate

18:24.240 --> 18:26.520
 and interrogate testosterone,

18:26.520 --> 18:30.540
 it was usually, you know, a six by 10 protocol.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.160
 So you touch in about-

18:32.160 --> 18:33.000
 Six by 10 meaning?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.440
 Yeah, six sets of 10 repetitions,

18:35.440 --> 18:37.320
 which is quite a large, you know,

18:37.320 --> 18:39.480
 60 repetitions is quite a large volume

18:39.480 --> 18:41.400
 for a single exercise,

18:41.400 --> 18:43.960
 and that was usually pitched at about 80%

18:43.960 --> 18:45.880
 of a one repetition max intensity.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.880
 Okay, so 80% of the one rep max,

18:47.880 --> 18:51.640
 six sets of 10 reps separated by rest of like-

18:51.640 --> 18:52.460
 Two minutes.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.240
 Two minutes, which is actually pretty fast,

18:54.240 --> 18:55.080
 at least to me.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.660
 Anytime you see these two to three minutes,

18:56.660 --> 18:58.440
 when you're actually watching the clock,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.520
 those two minute rest periods go by pretty fast.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.120
 By the third, fourth set, you're dying for more, yeah.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.640
 And I think, you know, we, you know,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.460
 we formulated that kind of exercise protocol

19:07.460 --> 19:11.280
 to really target, you know, the release of testosterone

19:11.280 --> 19:13.420
 and try and drive up these anabolic environments

19:13.420 --> 19:16.560
 to study the, you know, the endocrine, you know,

19:16.560 --> 19:17.400
 consequences.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.260
 But I think that's the type of protocol

19:20.260 --> 19:22.640
 that is most advantageous

19:22.640 --> 19:24.520
 for driving anabolic environments.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.280
 And that was it for the workout?

19:26.280 --> 19:28.160
 Yeah, I mean, we would do that in a back squat.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.200
 So, you know, multi-joint, you know, challenging exercise,

19:32.200 --> 19:35.320
 multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% loads

19:35.320 --> 19:38.040
 of your one repetition max, and then six by 10.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.240
 We did play around with, you know,

19:39.240 --> 19:44.240
 your classic German volume type 10 by 10 kind of protocols,

19:44.640 --> 19:47.640
 but they were just unsustainable at that 80%.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.160
 The key to what we also did was we always adjusted

19:51.160 --> 19:54.560
 the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions

19:54.560 --> 19:55.680
 that were sustained.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.880
 So if the load was too high and an athlete

19:58.880 --> 20:01.960
 or a participant had to drop the weights

20:01.960 --> 20:04.440
 on the sixth repetition, we would unload the bar

20:04.440 --> 20:06.680
 and make sure they completed the 10 repetitions.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.960
 Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity

20:08.960 --> 20:12.760
 and a volume derivative that is going to be most advantageous

20:12.760 --> 20:13.880
 for testosterone release.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.860
 That's really interesting.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.120
 And one thing that you mentioned there

20:16.120 --> 20:18.320
 is especially interesting to me, which is you said,

20:18.320 --> 20:21.580
 when you go from six sets of 10 repetitions

20:21.580 --> 20:24.560
 to 10 sets of 10 repetitions,

20:24.560 --> 20:27.520
 it's not as beneficial and might even be counterproductive.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.080
 But to me, the difference between six and 10 sets

20:30.080 --> 20:30.980
 is only four sets.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.260
 It doesn't even sound that much.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.240
 So that sort of hints at the possibility

20:34.240 --> 20:37.520
 that the thresholds for going from a workout

20:37.520 --> 20:39.480
 that increases testosterone to a workout

20:39.480 --> 20:41.280
 that diminishes testosterone

20:41.280 --> 20:43.040
 is actually a pretty narrow margin.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.500
 Yeah, and I think it comes back

20:44.500 --> 20:46.200
 to that intensity factor then, you know,

20:46.200 --> 20:49.040
 what we saw with that 10 by 10 protocol

20:49.040 --> 20:52.120
 really sees pretty significant drop-offs in the load.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.340
 And again, we're trying to stimulate with intensity,

20:55.340 --> 20:57.920
 with mechanical strain through intensity,

20:57.920 --> 21:00.160
 as well as metabolic strain through volume.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.760
 And I think that's the paradigm that you've got to look at

21:02.760 --> 21:05.840
 is that the mechanical load has to come from, you know,

21:05.840 --> 21:08.160
 the actual weight on the bar

21:08.160 --> 21:11.220
 and the volume is the metabolic stimulus.

21:11.220 --> 21:12.640
 How much are we driving lactate?

21:12.640 --> 21:15.040
 How much are we driving, you know, glycogenolysis

21:15.040 --> 21:19.180
 in terms of that type of energy system for, you know,

21:19.180 --> 21:21.480
 executing a 10 by 10 protocol?

21:21.480 --> 21:24.060
 And what we often saw was just a significant reduction

21:24.060 --> 21:27.360
 in the intensity capabilities of an athlete to sustain that.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.840
 So we shortened the volume

21:29.840 --> 21:32.040
 to try and maintain the intensity.

21:32.040 --> 21:32.880
 Interesting.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.240
 And you could imagine just taking very long rest,

21:36.240 --> 21:39.400
 keeping the session, being a big lazy bear in training.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.220
 I sometimes do this.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.160
 I tell myself I'm going to work out for 45 minutes

21:42.160 --> 21:43.680
 and then two hours later, I'm done.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.280
 But not because I was huffing and puffing the whole time,

21:46.280 --> 21:49.120
 but because I was training really slowly.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.440
 Is there any evidence that training slowly

21:51.440 --> 21:53.280
 can offset some of the negative effects

21:53.280 --> 21:54.600
 of doing a lot of volume?

21:54.600 --> 21:56.940
 Well, it's an old adage of, you know,

21:56.940 --> 21:58.400
 two responses to your question.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.880
 I mean, the first one I would say, you know,

21:59.880 --> 22:01.820
 there's a difference between 10 sets of six

22:01.820 --> 22:03.160
 and six sets of 10.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.640
 And I think that comes back to the volume conversation.

22:06.640 --> 22:10.280
 You know, six sets of 10 is driving up metabolic stimulus.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.960
 If you're doing 10 sets of six,

22:12.960 --> 22:14.560
 you can probably take it to a higher intensity,

22:14.560 --> 22:16.820
 but you're not going to get the same metabolic load.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.200
 You're not going to get the same

22:18.200 --> 22:19.920
 internal metabolic environment

22:19.920 --> 22:21.400
 that drives the lactate release,

22:21.400 --> 22:22.940
 that they will then signal, you know,

22:22.940 --> 22:25.240
 further anabolic testosterone release

22:25.240 --> 22:27.080
 because of the lactate in your body.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.600
 That's a key consideration.

22:30.600 --> 22:35.240
 The rest is often the consideration that's overlooked

22:35.240 --> 22:36.720
 out there in general population

22:36.720 --> 22:37.960
 and in many sporting environments.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.620
 You know, the rest is as important a programming variable

22:41.620 --> 22:44.440
 as the load and the intensity of the load,

22:44.440 --> 22:45.900
 the volume, et cetera.

22:45.900 --> 22:49.680
 And yes, if you remove, if you extend the volume,

22:49.680 --> 22:52.780
 if you extend the duration of your rest periods,

22:52.780 --> 22:54.960
 what you're ultimately doing is influencing

22:54.960 --> 22:56.560
 that metabolic stimulus again.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.280
 You're allowing the flushing of the body,

22:58.280 --> 23:00.160
 the removal of waste products, you know,

23:00.160 --> 23:03.480
 lactate to be, you know, removed from the body.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.040
 And then the metabolic environment is reduced.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.260
 So you want, so if I understand correctly,

23:09.260 --> 23:11.400
 you want to create a metabolic stress.

23:11.400 --> 23:15.400
 So the way that I've been training slow and lazy

23:15.400 --> 23:17.820
 is not necessarily the best way to go.

23:17.820 --> 23:21.680
 I could, in theory, do a 45 or 60 minute session

23:21.680 --> 23:24.840
 where I pack in more work per unit time.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.440
 I'm not going to be able to, quote unquote, perform as well.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.240
 I won't be able to lift as much.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.320
 I'm going to have to, you know,

23:30.320 --> 23:33.040
 unweight the bar between sets or maybe even during sets

23:33.040 --> 23:34.880
 if I have someone who could do that.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.940
 But it sounds like that's the way to go.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.560
 So it's got to be, so this,

23:38.560 --> 23:41.000
 the old adage of high intensity short duration

23:41.000 --> 23:42.120
 is probably the way to go.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.200
 Correct, and you know, in layman's terms,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.880
 if the same objective, the same training goal

23:47.880 --> 23:49.400
 is just muscle tissue growth,

23:49.400 --> 23:51.480
 and we're not talking about maximal strength

23:51.480 --> 23:52.840
 or any of those type of parameters.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.760
 We're just talking about growing muscle.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.800
 If there's an athlete A and they do six sets of 10

23:57.800 --> 23:59.720
 with two minutes rest and there's athlete B

23:59.720 --> 24:02.320
 that does six sets of 10 with three minutes rest,

24:02.320 --> 24:05.400
 athlete A will likely see the highest muscle gain,

24:05.400 --> 24:08.400
 muscle hypertrophy gains because of the metabolic stimulus

24:08.400 --> 24:10.400
 that they're driving with the shorter rest periods.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.160
 Interesting, for all the years that I've spent

24:14.020 --> 24:16.600
 exploring exercise science and trying to get this

24:16.600 --> 24:18.840
 information from the internet and various places

24:18.840 --> 24:21.140
 that this is the first time it's ever been

24:21.140 --> 24:22.140
 told to me clearly.

24:22.140 --> 24:24.880
 So basically I need to put my ego aside

24:24.880 --> 24:28.960
 and I need to not focus so much on getting as many reps

24:28.960 --> 24:32.720
 with a given weight and keep the rest restricted

24:32.720 --> 24:35.320
 to about two minutes, get the work in,

24:35.320 --> 24:37.540
 and then I'll derive the benefits.

24:37.540 --> 24:39.240
 I mean, you've absolutely nailed it to be honest.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.080
 And again, if you think about human nature

24:41.080 --> 24:43.440
 and how we approached, we're inherently lazy, right?

24:43.440 --> 24:47.480
 As humans, we want to take that rest.

24:47.480 --> 24:50.840
 We want to take the time out to recover and feel refreshed,

24:50.840 --> 24:53.560
 but we're trying to create a training stimulus.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.540
 We're trying to create a very specific stimulus

24:55.540 --> 24:57.980
 internal to the body, and that is often driven

24:57.980 --> 25:00.900
 by the metabolic environment at that moment in time.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.620
 Now, if we allow the metabolic environment to change

25:03.620 --> 25:06.640
 by extending the rest periods, we're not going to see

25:06.640 --> 25:08.600
 as beneficial gains at the end of it.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.980
 So it is very much a motivational and ego thing

25:14.400 --> 25:17.180
 rather than saying, okay, I'm going to push my loads

25:17.180 --> 25:19.760
 as high as I can and really challenge maximal strength,

25:19.760 --> 25:22.340
 do fewer repetitions, take longer periods of time.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.600
 It's a completely different approach to training.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.840
 It's a different end goal.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.320
 Interesting, and you mentioned lactate.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.320
 So it seems still a bit controversial

25:30.320 --> 25:32.520
 as to what actually triggers hypertrophy you hear

25:32.520 --> 25:35.800
 about lactate buildup or people, the common language

25:35.800 --> 25:37.880
 is the muscle gets torn and then repairs,

25:37.880 --> 25:40.040
 but I don't know, does the muscle actually tear?

25:40.040 --> 25:40.880
 I mean, microtrauma.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.880
 Okay, microtrauma.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.080
 Disruption of, you know, within the muscle tissue.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.800
 Interesting, and we're talking now

25:46.800 --> 25:51.440
 about non-drug assisted people who's, let's just say,

25:51.440 --> 25:53.080
 let's define our terms here,

25:53.080 --> 25:56.560
 that whose testosterone levels are within the range

25:56.560 --> 25:59.760
 of somewhere between 300 and 1,500 or whatever, 1,200,

26:00.820 --> 26:04.960
 because it does seem that athletes who take high levels

26:04.960 --> 26:07.920
 of exogenous androgens can do more work

26:07.920 --> 26:11.200
 and just get protein synthesis from just doing work.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.240
 I've seen these guys in the gym, right?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.560
 The hotel signs are not that hard to spot

26:15.560 --> 26:18.000
 where they're just doing a ton of volume,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.640
 not necessarily moving that much weight.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.000
 They're just bringing blood into the tissue

26:22.000 --> 26:24.480
 and then they're loading up on,

26:24.480 --> 26:25.620
 they're eating a ton of protein,

26:25.620 --> 26:28.600
 presumably because they're basically in puberty part 15.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.040
 Right, they got in their 15th round of puberty

26:31.040 --> 26:35.520
 where during puberty, you are a protein synthesis machine.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.160
 I mean, that's, to me, that's pretty clear about puberty.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.800
 Interesting, so, and then in terms of,

26:42.800 --> 26:45.840
 because I know the audience likes to try protocol,

26:45.840 --> 26:48.780
 so you described a protocol very nicely.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.480
 What about day-to-day recovery?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.240
 I mean, can the workout that you described

26:53.240 --> 26:55.320
 is intense but short, how many days a week

26:55.320 --> 26:59.280
 can the typical person do that and sustain progress?

26:59.280 --> 27:01.480
 Yeah, I mean, I think that comes back to your training age

27:01.480 --> 27:02.360
 and your training history.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.520
 Obviously, there's a resilience and a robustness

27:04.520 --> 27:06.720
 with an incremental training age.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.920
 So, that's not a protocol that I would advise anyone

27:09.920 --> 27:12.160
 to go out and start tomorrow.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.200
 They'll be mopping them off the gym floor.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.280
 But at the same time, it's also relative, right?

27:16.280 --> 27:20.300
 So 80% of your maximum at a young training age

27:20.300 --> 27:23.320
 is still 80% versus, I've been training 10 years,

27:23.320 --> 27:25.960
 it's still 80%, but yes, the mechanical load

27:25.960 --> 27:29.800
 is gonna be significant, it's just more tonnage, right?

27:29.800 --> 27:31.760
 But yeah, I think a protocol like that,

27:31.760 --> 27:34.000
 we would look at two times a week,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.200
 something that's pretty intensive like that,

27:36.200 --> 27:38.040
 because again, it comes back to the point you make

27:38.040 --> 27:41.360
 is that you really need to be, for want of better terms,

27:41.360 --> 27:44.000
 suffering a little bit through that type of protocol,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.680
 both in terms of the challenge of the load,

27:46.680 --> 27:50.000
 but also being able to tolerate the metabolic stress

27:50.000 --> 27:50.960
 that you're exposed to.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.840
 It's a bit of a sicko feeling, right?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.560
 Because of the lactate that you're driving up.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.920
 So I wouldn't promote an athlete doing that type

27:59.920 --> 28:02.720
 of modality multiple, multiple times,

28:02.720 --> 28:05.440
 unless you're from the realms of bodybuilding,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.660
 and then you really, that's the sole purpose

28:07.660 --> 28:08.860
 of what you're trying to achieve.

28:08.860 --> 28:13.860
 Most athletes in most sports have diverse requirements

28:14.160 --> 28:16.060
 in terms of outcomes that they're trying to achieve.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.640
 They're not just targeting muscle growth.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.200
 Muscle growth is a conduit to increase strength,

28:22.200 --> 28:24.960
 increase power, increase speed, obviously.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.440
 So yes, trying to get bigger cross-sectional area

28:27.440 --> 28:29.500
 of a muscle means that we can produce more force

28:29.500 --> 28:31.560
 into the ground or wherever it may be

28:31.560 --> 28:33.200
 if we're a locomotive athlete.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.440
 But usually sports men and women

28:35.440 --> 28:38.360
 are not just purely seeking muscle growth.

28:38.360 --> 28:42.060
 They look for different facets of muscle endurance

28:42.060 --> 28:45.120
 or maximal muscle power, muscle strength.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.820
 So then you've got to be very creative

28:46.820 --> 28:48.280
 in how you build the workout.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.920
 If it's a bodybuilder, absolutely.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.240
 They're chasing muscle growth,

28:51.240 --> 28:53.520
 and they're gonna do so with these types of protocols,

28:53.520 --> 28:57.640
 which sees high intensities and high volumes of workload

28:57.640 --> 28:59.560
 on a pretty regular basis.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.000
 If it's just somebody, a weekend warrior

29:03.000 --> 29:04.920
 that wants to keep in shape and look good,

29:04.920 --> 29:06.880
 I would say two times a week

29:06.880 --> 29:08.680
 for a really challenging workout like that,

29:08.680 --> 29:11.840
 and then flex the other types of workouts within the week

29:11.840 --> 29:13.880
 to have more of a volume emphasis,

29:13.880 --> 29:15.260
 where you reduce the intensity,

29:15.260 --> 29:17.880
 and you might just look at larger rep ranges

29:17.880 --> 29:19.760
 from 12 to 15 to 20,

29:19.760 --> 29:22.880
 another workout where you're looking at reducing the volume,

29:22.880 --> 29:24.240
 but increasing the intensity

29:24.240 --> 29:27.400
 and really trying to drive a different stimulus

29:27.400 --> 29:31.160
 to give you more end points of success.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.100
 Great, no, that's really informative.

29:34.100 --> 29:38.360
 Along the lines of androgens and intensity,

29:38.360 --> 29:41.360
 when I think intensity, I think epinephrine, adrenaline.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.400
 And since you have a background

29:43.400 --> 29:45.920
 in catecholamines and testosterone,

29:45.920 --> 29:48.560
 last time I was here at the USC Performance Institute,

29:48.560 --> 29:49.800
 we had a brief conversation

29:49.800 --> 29:52.120
 and I want to make sure I got the details right,

29:52.120 --> 29:54.060
 that in the short term,

29:54.060 --> 29:56.620
 and a big increase in stress hormone

29:56.620 --> 29:58.640
 can lead to an increase in testosterone,

29:58.640 --> 30:00.480
 like a parachute jump.

30:01.400 --> 30:06.400
 But so stress can promote the release of testosterone.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.040
 That was news to me.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.280
 We always hear about stress suppressing testosterone,

30:11.280 --> 30:12.720
 stress suppressing the immune system,

30:12.720 --> 30:13.760
 all these terrible things.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.440
 But in the short term,

30:15.440 --> 30:17.240
 you're saying it can actually increase

30:17.240 --> 30:18.780
 the release of testosterone.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.000
 So I have that right?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.140
 Correct. Okay.

30:22.140 --> 30:24.680
 And so then the second question is,

30:24.680 --> 30:29.280
 does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor

30:29.280 --> 30:30.120
 make a difference?

30:30.120 --> 30:33.200
 In other words, if I voluntarily jump out of a plane

30:33.200 --> 30:34.160
 with a parachute,

30:35.100 --> 30:37.520
 does it have a different effect on my testosterone

30:37.520 --> 30:40.120
 than if you shove me out of the plane against my will,

30:40.120 --> 30:42.580
 or presumably with a parachute too?

30:42.580 --> 30:46.640
 I mean, so this was what all my PhD work was looking at,

30:46.640 --> 30:51.640
 was the exposure to a stressor and the pre-arousal

30:55.320 --> 30:57.560
 of how your body essentially prepares for that stressor,

30:57.560 --> 30:58.760
 and then how it manages it

30:58.760 --> 31:00.480
 throughout the exposure to the stress.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.680
 And it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.800
 There was an older study looking at parachute jumpers

31:06.800 --> 31:08.680
 into combat.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.600
 And then they were studying the cortisol,

31:11.600 --> 31:13.720
 the stress response and the epinephrine response

31:13.720 --> 31:14.840
 of these parachute jumpers.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.360
 So we got us thinking about, hold on,

31:17.360 --> 31:18.820
 there's certain workouts that you do

31:18.820 --> 31:20.520
 that are just the daunting.

31:20.520 --> 31:24.240
 It's like, okay, it's squat Saturday or whatever it may be.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.480
 Oh my gosh, this is going to destroy me.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.840
 Or I have to talk to this person I don't want to talk to,

31:29.840 --> 31:31.160
 or what, right?

31:31.160 --> 31:34.960
 I mean, something, or a PhD dissertation exam or something.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.720
 Giving public speaking or whatever it may be.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.160
 Now, we used a resistance training protocol

31:41.160 --> 31:43.940
 that these athletes knew was going to be

31:43.940 --> 31:45.160
 very, very challenging.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.080
 It's going to be,

31:46.080 --> 31:48.380
 that it's going to have some anxiety to doing it.

31:48.380 --> 31:49.200
 They knew there were going to be

31:49.200 --> 31:51.560
 some physical distress from doing it.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.360
 And therefore, their mindset

31:54.360 --> 31:56.760
 of how they were going to approach that was already set.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.440
 So what we saw prior,

31:58.440 --> 32:03.120
 15 minutes prior to the start of an exposure to the workout,

32:03.120 --> 32:05.040
 the epinephrine, the neuro adrenaline,

32:05.040 --> 32:06.440
 the adrenaline was already starting

32:06.440 --> 32:09.100
 to prepare the body sympathetically

32:09.100 --> 32:11.020
 to go into what it knew was going to be

32:11.020 --> 32:13.080
 a very, very challenging workout.

32:13.080 --> 32:16.560
 So that brings you back to exercise preparation,

32:16.560 --> 32:19.000
 competition for certain preparation,

32:19.000 --> 32:22.080
 preparation for certain competition, excuse me.

32:22.080 --> 32:26.240
 Pre-workout routines, the use of music,

32:26.240 --> 32:28.640
 all these different things that we know

32:28.640 --> 32:32.200
 can now, anecdotally in the gym, we put into place.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.260
 But the data that I presented showed that

32:35.260 --> 32:37.520
 it was the first of its kind to show that this link

32:37.520 --> 32:41.600
 between epinephrine and norepinephrine release

32:41.600 --> 32:44.100
 and arousal and then consequent performance.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.880
 So force output throughout the workout

32:46.880 --> 32:47.920
 was intimately linked.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.260
 So what was the takeaway there?

32:50.260 --> 32:53.600
 Is it beneficial for people to get a little stressed

32:53.600 --> 32:55.800
 about the upcoming impending event,

32:55.800 --> 32:57.840
 whether or not it's a lift in the gym

32:57.840 --> 32:59.980
 or whether or not it's talking to somebody

32:59.980 --> 33:04.560
 that you might be intimidated to talk to or an exam?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.800
 Is the stress good for performance or is it harmful?

33:07.800 --> 33:09.840
 Yeah, and I think that's a great question.

33:09.840 --> 33:13.240
 And I think I can only talk to physical exertion,

33:13.240 --> 33:15.640
 which is what we were exploring.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.680
 And I don't want to tread on the toes of the psychologist

33:18.680 --> 33:20.400
 with flow state and these types of things,

33:20.400 --> 33:21.240
 because clearly-

33:21.240 --> 33:22.680
 I think you're in the position

33:22.680 --> 33:24.600
 of scientific strength on this one.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.680
 I think you have the leverage.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.640
 I mean, I have a lot of friends in that community,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.460
 as I'll just say, as a buffer to the answer

33:31.460 --> 33:32.360
 you're about to give,

33:32.360 --> 33:36.920
 that there's very little science around flow

33:36.920 --> 33:38.360
 and there's very little neuroscience

33:38.360 --> 33:40.460
 related to most psychological states anyway.

33:40.460 --> 33:42.480
 So I think we've got a lot of degrees of freedom here.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.640
 All right, I can breathe easy, thank you for that.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.920
 I'll be anything you like, credit Duncan,

33:47.920 --> 33:52.120
 anything you dislike, send the mean comments to me.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.000
 Yeah, I think from my data,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.180
 certainly the greater the arousal,

33:56.180 --> 33:57.680
 the higher the performance was

33:57.680 --> 34:00.080
 from a physical exertion perspective.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.960
 And I think that was the intriguing part

34:01.960 --> 34:02.920
 of some of my findings,

34:02.920 --> 34:05.840
 where there's definitely an individual biokinetics

34:05.840 --> 34:08.840
 to some of these hormonal releases.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.520
 And as much as those guys

34:10.520 --> 34:14.020
 that had the highest adrenergic response

34:14.020 --> 34:16.660
 in terms of epinephrine release, norepinephrine release,

34:16.660 --> 34:19.400
 also sustained force output

34:19.400 --> 34:23.540
 for a longer period of the workout than those that didn't.

34:23.540 --> 34:27.960
 So the individuals that had a lower stimulus

34:27.960 --> 34:30.380
 of the sympathetic arousal, let's say,

34:30.380 --> 34:32.820
 certainly didn't perform as well throughout the workout.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.920
 Now, the intriguing thing then becomes,

34:34.920 --> 34:38.560
 is okay, and I think this really segues

34:38.560 --> 34:41.400
 into what we're doing here with combat athletes,

34:41.400 --> 34:43.080
 with mixed martial artists.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.340
 You know, there's a philosophy, there's a paradigm now

34:45.340 --> 34:48.000
 for myself in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.720
 You know, the more you do that challenging workout,

34:50.720 --> 34:53.940
 do you get the same psychological stimulus?

34:53.940 --> 34:56.040
 Do you still get the same stress response?

34:56.040 --> 34:58.600
 And the assumption is unlikely.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.680
 You know, you accommodate,

34:59.680 --> 35:01.760
 you become accustomed to the stressor,

35:01.760 --> 35:03.160
 your body will therefore adapt,

35:03.160 --> 35:05.880
 and that's the classic overload principle, right?

35:05.880 --> 35:08.200
 You then need to take the stressor down a different route.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.920
 But I think when you look at the athletes

35:11.920 --> 35:13.880
 that we work with here,

35:13.880 --> 35:16.040
 it's a fist fight at the end of the day.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.620
 There's nothing more stressful than that.

35:17.620 --> 35:20.920
 But I think just the exposure to the rigors of training,

35:20.920 --> 35:24.680
 to understand the bad positions, the bad situations,

35:24.680 --> 35:27.080
 to know that they can get out of certain situations,

35:27.080 --> 35:31.000
 out of certain submission holds or whatever it may be,

35:31.000 --> 35:34.160
 I think that really ties in with some of my PhD work

35:34.160 --> 35:36.640
 in terms of what these guys do to approach

35:36.640 --> 35:38.680
 what is a really challenging sport

35:38.680 --> 35:40.080
 and arena in mixed martial arts.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.460
 Yeah, it's definitely the extreme of what's possible

35:43.460 --> 35:44.560
 in terms of asking,

35:44.560 --> 35:48.020
 does stress favor or hinder performance?

35:48.020 --> 35:49.920
 Because yeah, like you said, at the end of the day,

35:49.920 --> 35:53.920
 it's someone trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can

35:53.920 --> 35:55.040
 within the bounds of the rules,

35:55.040 --> 35:56.540
 and you're trying to do the same.

35:56.540 --> 35:58.440
 So that's, you know,

35:58.440 --> 36:00.580
 I find that your thesis work fascinating.

36:00.580 --> 36:04.520
 Where you never to be at the UFC Performance Institute,

36:04.520 --> 36:07.680
 luckily they made the right choice and brought you here.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.480
 But where you have never to come here,

36:09.480 --> 36:13.280
 I was still fascinated by this because over and over,

36:13.280 --> 36:16.500
 we hear that stress is bad, stress is bad, stress is bad.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.840
 But everything I read from the scientific literature

36:18.840 --> 36:22.760
 is that stress and epinephrine in particular

36:22.760 --> 36:24.880
 is coupled to the testosterone response

36:24.880 --> 36:27.100
 to performance and to adaptation,

36:27.100 --> 36:29.920
 provided it doesn't go on too long.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.120
 So unless I'm saying something that violates that,

36:33.120 --> 36:34.400
 I mean, that's your work.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.360
 So it's a really important and beautiful work,

36:37.360 --> 36:39.000
 and I refer to it often.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.680
 So I'm just glad that we could bolt that down

36:42.680 --> 36:45.320
 because I think the people need to know this,

36:45.320 --> 36:48.360
 that that discomfort is beneficial.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.880
 Now there's another side to this that I want to ask about,

36:51.880 --> 36:54.560
 which is the use of cold.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.560
 In particular, things like ice baths, cold showers,

36:58.560 --> 37:03.560
 or any other type of cold temperature exposure,

37:05.460 --> 37:08.560
 in theory, that's stress also, it's epinephrine.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.360
 And so how should one think

37:11.360 --> 37:14.320
 about the use of cold for recovery?

37:14.320 --> 37:18.720
 So if it's stress, if cold causes stress,

37:18.720 --> 37:21.820
 then how is cold used for recovery?

37:21.820 --> 37:23.160
 That's what I don't understand.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.920
 And maybe you just want to share your thoughts on that.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.980
 Yeah, no, and I think it's a great question.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.200
 And I think the jury is still out there, certainly,

37:32.200 --> 37:34.400
 knowing some of the conversations that we've been having.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.240
 But I think when we talk about stress,

37:36.240 --> 37:40.180
 it's your classic fight, flight, or freeze approach.

37:40.180 --> 37:43.720
 And throwing your body into a cold tub,

37:43.720 --> 37:46.160
 an ice bath or whatever it may be,

37:46.160 --> 37:49.360
 certainly is going to have a physiological stress response.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.980
 Now, people are using that for different end goals.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.820
 And again, I think that's where the narrative

37:54.820 --> 37:56.820
 has to be explained.

37:56.820 --> 37:59.260
 If you are using that stress specifically

37:59.260 --> 38:02.000
 to manage the mindset,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.820
 to use it as a specific stress stimulus,

38:04.820 --> 38:08.120
 that's the same as me doing six by 10, 80%.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.200
 You're just trying to find something to disrupt the system

38:11.200 --> 38:14.600
 to do something that's very, if you want a better term,

38:14.600 --> 38:17.600
 painful, discomfort, whatever.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.080
 You're just finding a stressor

38:19.080 --> 38:21.380
 and then being able to manage the mindset.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.500
 But if you're using cold,

38:23.500 --> 38:25.960
 specifically from a physiological perspective,

38:25.960 --> 38:30.960
 to promote redistribution of vascular,

38:31.480 --> 38:35.400
 of blood's flow to different vascular areas of muscle

38:35.400 --> 38:36.820
 that you feel have gone through a workout,

38:36.820 --> 38:38.640
 that are damaged or whatever it may be,

38:38.640 --> 38:40.760
 I think we've got to understand

38:40.760 --> 38:43.480
 what that stress mechanism is.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.720
 And the data, the literature,

38:45.720 --> 38:46.940
 is certainly still out there

38:46.940 --> 38:50.000
 with respect to cryotherapy and cold baths

38:50.000 --> 38:54.200
 and some of these high, these cold exposures

38:54.200 --> 38:57.300
 in terms of what they do at the level of the muscle tissue.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.820
 If that's the target,

38:58.820 --> 39:02.040
 if you're trying to promote a flushing mechanism

39:02.040 --> 39:04.060
 or you're trying to promote redistribution

39:04.060 --> 39:05.420
 of the blood flow,

39:05.420 --> 39:07.040
 what you've got to understand is that cold

39:07.040 --> 39:10.420
 is gonna clamp down every part of the vascular system

39:10.420 --> 39:12.500
 and we've really got to understand

39:12.500 --> 39:15.980
 how the muscle would be redistributed

39:15.980 --> 39:17.200
 to areas of interest.

39:17.200 --> 39:22.120
 So, I think the stress response is a real thing

39:22.120 --> 39:25.300
 with respect to cold exposure.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.280
 But I think the narrative around

39:27.280 --> 39:28.840
 what are you using the cold for

39:28.840 --> 39:30.880
 has to precede the conversation.

39:30.880 --> 39:35.680
 Because yes, it's like putting your hand over a hot cold.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.920
 That's a stress the same way as jumping in a cold bath is.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.360
 I think most people don't realize that.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.760
 You're gonna get the epinephrine release

39:42.760 --> 39:45.360
 from holding your hand too close to the flame

39:45.360 --> 39:47.040
 and you're gonna get it from getting in the ice bath.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.800
 Your body doesn't know the difference, right?

39:48.800 --> 39:50.440
 Your body does not know the difference.

39:50.440 --> 39:55.440
 It has a primordial kind of physiological response

39:56.440 --> 39:58.800
 that it's created over millions and millions of years.

39:58.800 --> 40:03.000
 And I think that physiology is not changing

40:03.000 --> 40:05.440
 and it's fixed in a particular way right now

40:06.500 --> 40:07.960
 that it doesn't understand the difference

40:07.960 --> 40:09.480
 between whether it's six by 10

40:09.480 --> 40:11.140
 doing a challenging workout over here,

40:11.140 --> 40:13.000
 whether it's putting my hands on the hot cold,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.920
 whether it's a lion stood in front of me or whatever.

40:14.920 --> 40:18.200
 That epinephrine response from the level of the brain

40:18.200 --> 40:21.700
 down to the whole signaling cascade is the same.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.840
 And cold I've heard can actually prevent

40:24.840 --> 40:27.960
 some of the beneficial effects of training

40:27.960 --> 40:30.360
 that it can actually get in the way

40:30.360 --> 40:33.040
 of muscle growth, et cetera.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.740
 Yeah, there's some pretty robust data out there now

40:35.740 --> 40:37.780
 showing that it definitely has an influence

40:37.780 --> 40:39.960
 on performance variables like strength and power

40:39.960 --> 40:41.960
 in particular, but absolutely

40:41.960 --> 40:43.600
 in terms of muscle hypertrophy.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.680
 And there's a big kind of theme

40:45.680 --> 40:48.400
 in the world of athletic performance right now

40:48.400 --> 40:52.540
 in terms of periodization of cold exposure

40:52.540 --> 40:54.680
 as a recovery modality.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.580
 When do you use cold?

40:56.580 --> 40:59.760
 Should you be using cold for recovery

40:59.760 --> 41:01.360
 in periods of high training load

41:01.360 --> 41:02.760
 when you're actually pursuing

41:02.760 --> 41:05.120
 maybe general proprietary work

41:05.120 --> 41:06.960
 where you're actually trying to pursue muscle growth?

41:06.960 --> 41:09.640
 Well, that's usually where you get the most sore.

41:09.640 --> 41:12.820
 It's usually where you feel the most fatigued,

41:12.820 --> 41:15.000
 but it's probably not the most beneficial approach

41:15.000 --> 41:17.320
 to use an ice bath in that scenario

41:17.320 --> 41:19.520
 because you're dampening, you're dulling

41:19.520 --> 41:24.520
 the mTOR pathway and the hypertrophic signaling pathway.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.160
 Whereas in a competition phase

41:27.160 --> 41:29.600
 where actually quality of exercise

41:29.600 --> 41:32.760
 and quality of execution of skill and technical work

41:32.760 --> 41:34.620
 has to be maintained,

41:34.620 --> 41:38.260
 you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery capabilities

41:38.260 --> 41:40.080
 and recovery interventions in that scenario

41:40.080 --> 41:43.680
 because you now, the muscle building activity

41:43.680 --> 41:44.520
 should be in the bank.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.440
 That should have been done in the general preparatory work.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.640
 And now you're focusing on technical execution.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.380
 So you're absolutely right.

41:52.380 --> 41:53.220
 No, it's interesting.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.680
 So if I understand correctly,

41:55.680 --> 41:59.840
 if I want to maximize muscle growth or power

41:59.840 --> 42:02.980
 or improvements and adaptations,

42:02.980 --> 42:04.580
 then the inflammation response,

42:04.580 --> 42:06.140
 the delayed onset muscle soreness,

42:06.140 --> 42:08.320
 all this stuff that's uncomfortable

42:08.320 --> 42:09.360
 and that we hear is so terrible

42:09.360 --> 42:11.920
 is actually the stimulus for adaptation.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.500
 And so using cold in that situation

42:14.500 --> 42:16.680
 might short circuit my progress.

42:16.680 --> 42:19.640
 But if I'm, you know, I don't know that I'll ever do this,

42:19.640 --> 42:22.180
 but if I were to do an Ironman or something

42:22.180 --> 42:24.520
 or run a marathon under those conditions,

42:24.520 --> 42:27.960
 I'm basically coming to the race, so to speak,

42:27.960 --> 42:30.660
 with all the power and strength I'm going to have.

42:30.660 --> 42:32.660
 And so there, reducing inflammation is good

42:32.660 --> 42:33.600
 because it's going to allow me

42:33.600 --> 42:35.860
 to perform more work, essentially.

42:35.860 --> 42:36.700
 Absolutely.

42:36.700 --> 42:38.480
 Yeah, you have to be strategic

42:38.480 --> 42:40.820
 about when you use some of these interventions.

42:40.820 --> 42:43.200
 And, you know, the time when you're preparing

42:43.200 --> 42:46.400
 for a competition is not the appropriate time, excuse me,

42:46.400 --> 42:48.680
 is the appropriate time when you want to drive recovery

42:48.680 --> 42:51.440
 and make sure that your body is optimized.

42:51.440 --> 42:55.280
 You know, when you're far away from a competition,

42:55.280 --> 42:57.880
 you know, date or, you know, out of season

42:57.880 --> 42:58.720
 or whatever it may be,

42:58.720 --> 43:01.320
 and you're really trying to just tear up the body

43:01.320 --> 43:04.780
 a little bit to allow it to, it's natural, you know,

43:04.780 --> 43:07.520
 healing and adaptation processes to take place.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.840
 Well, you don't want to negate that.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.860
 You know, you want the body to optimize

43:10.860 --> 43:11.960
 its internal recovery,

43:11.960 --> 43:14.000
 and that's how muscle growth is going to happen, so.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
 So interesting.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.400
 There's a time kind of consideration

43:17.400 --> 43:19.380
 that you need to make with these interventions, for sure.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.200
 At the UFC Performance Center,

43:21.200 --> 43:24.040
 are the fighters periodizing their cold exposure

43:24.040 --> 43:28.080
 or are they just doing cold at will?

43:28.080 --> 43:29.600
 Well, it's not just the UFC.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.540
 And again, I talk about my personal experiences

43:32.540 --> 43:33.380
 with different sports.

43:33.380 --> 43:37.160
 I think just education around where science is at,

43:37.160 --> 43:39.720
 and our understanding of concepts

43:39.720 --> 43:42.780
 like the use of cold exposure for recovery, ice bath.

43:42.780 --> 43:44.840
 You know, everyone wants to jump in an ice bath.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.980
 But I think as we've stepped back

43:46.980 --> 43:49.080
 and scientists have started to say,

43:49.080 --> 43:51.800
 have started to figure out and look at some of the data,

43:51.800 --> 43:54.320
 you know, we're now more intuitive about,

43:54.320 --> 43:56.240
 well, actually that might not be the best

43:56.240 --> 43:57.540
 or the most optimal approach.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.700
 And I think that's any given sport.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.760
 So yes, certainly here at the UFC,

44:01.760 --> 44:03.840
 we're trying to educate our athletes

44:03.840 --> 44:06.140
 around, you know, appropriate timing.

44:06.140 --> 44:07.520
 And it's the same with nutrition.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.640
 It's the same with an ice bath intervention.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.260
 It's the same with lifting weights.

44:11.260 --> 44:12.520
 It's the same with going for a run

44:12.520 --> 44:13.560
 or working out on the bike.

44:13.560 --> 44:17.420
 You know, there's tactics to when you do things

44:17.420 --> 44:18.340
 and when you don't do things.

44:18.340 --> 44:22.360
 And I think, you know, stress and cold exposure,

44:22.360 --> 44:24.480
 we have to have a consideration around that as well.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.360
 But it's not just, you know, MMA fighters.

44:26.360 --> 44:27.860
 That's any athlete.

44:27.860 --> 44:32.160
 And I think it's the best professionals,

44:32.160 --> 44:35.280
 the most successful professionals do that really well.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.960
 They listen, number one.

44:36.960 --> 44:40.300
 They educate themselves and then they build structure.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.760
 And I think, you know, at the most elite level,

44:42.760 --> 44:44.680
 we always talk about it here at the UFC,

44:44.680 --> 44:46.220
 but the most elite level,

44:46.220 --> 44:49.120
 you're not necessarily training harder than anybody else.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.760
 Everybody in the UFC trains hard.

44:51.760 --> 44:54.240
 Like everyone is training super hard.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.240
 But the best athletes, the true elite levels

44:57.240 --> 44:59.560
 are the ones that can do it again and again and again

44:59.560 --> 45:02.520
 on a daily basis and sustain a technical output

45:02.520 --> 45:03.680
 for skill development.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.160
 Therefore their skills can improve

45:05.160 --> 45:06.160
 or physical development,

45:06.160 --> 45:08.240
 their physical attributes can improve.

45:08.240 --> 45:11.440
 So that ability to reproduce on a day-to-day basis

45:11.440 --> 45:14.560
 falls into a recovery conversation.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.200
 Now, when is the right time to use

45:16.200 --> 45:17.800
 something like an ice bath and when isn't

45:17.800 --> 45:21.640
 is part of the high-performance conversation for sure.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.080
 So really they're scientists.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.040
 They're building structure.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.720
 They're figuring out variables.

45:25.720 --> 45:29.680
 But it sounds like the ability to do more quality work

45:29.680 --> 45:31.640
 over time is one of the key variables.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.000
 I mean, it's fundamental.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.080
 I mean, garbage in, garbage out, quality in, quality out.

45:37.080 --> 45:41.200
 But in our sport, I talk about mixed martial arts,

45:41.200 --> 45:43.360
 it's truly a decathlon of combat.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.040
 So there's so many different attributes,

45:45.040 --> 45:46.880
 whether it's a grappling, whether it's a wrestling,

45:46.880 --> 45:48.160
 whether it's a transition work,

45:48.160 --> 45:49.720
 whether it's a standup striking.

45:49.720 --> 45:53.920
 So the different facets of a training program in this sport

45:53.920 --> 45:57.560
 are significantly large compared to something like

45:58.720 --> 46:00.120
 a wide receiver in football.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.760
 And that's no disrespect for wide receivers,

46:01.760 --> 46:02.800
 but they run routes.

46:02.800 --> 46:06.160
 They're gonna run a route, a passing tree,

46:06.160 --> 46:07.320
 and that's all they need to do.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.760
 These guys have to be on the ground.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.640
 They gotta be great on the ground.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.720
 They gotta be great standing up.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.360
 They gotta be great with the back against the fence.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.960
 There's so many different kind of facets to our sport.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.800
 So managing the distribution of all the training components

46:19.800 --> 46:22.440
 is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.760
 And the best guys get that right.

46:24.760 --> 46:28.520
 They allow their body to optimize the training.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.280
 And remember, why are we doing training?

46:30.280 --> 46:34.760
 We're doing training for technical and tactical improvement.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.120
 Now, if your body is fatigued

46:37.120 --> 46:39.160
 or you just can't expose yourself

46:39.160 --> 46:42.600
 to more tactical development or technical development,

46:42.600 --> 46:45.640
 then you're essentially doing yourself a disservice.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.360
 You're gonna be behind the curve

46:47.360 --> 46:48.400
 with respect to those guys

46:48.400 --> 46:50.720
 that can reproduce that day in, day out.

46:50.720 --> 46:55.160
 On the topic of skill development, regardless of sport,

46:55.160 --> 46:56.480
 we hear all the time,

46:56.480 --> 47:00.120
 and it certainly is intuitive to me,

47:00.120 --> 47:02.900
 that the person who can focus the best

47:02.900 --> 47:05.260
 will progress the fastest.

47:05.260 --> 47:06.100
 But it's kind of interesting.

47:06.100 --> 47:07.400
 Sometimes I talk to athletes

47:07.400 --> 47:12.260
 and they seem a little bit laid back

47:12.260 --> 47:14.200
 about their training sometimes,

47:14.200 --> 47:16.800
 and yet they obviously know how to flip the switch

47:16.800 --> 47:19.480
 and they can really dial in the intensity.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.560
 Do you think that there are optimal protocols

47:21.560 --> 47:24.660
 for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning?

47:24.660 --> 47:26.400
 Like, could it ever be parameterized

47:26.400 --> 47:28.660
 like the six sets of 10 reps?

47:28.660 --> 47:31.660
 And this gets to the heart of neuroplasticity,

47:31.660 --> 47:34.180
 which is still, it's not a black box,

47:34.180 --> 47:36.120
 but it's kind of a black box

47:36.120 --> 47:39.500
 with portions of it illuminated, I like to say.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.340
 But what are your thoughts on skill development?

47:41.340 --> 47:44.780
 Is there, for somebody that wants to get better at sport,

47:44.780 --> 47:48.480
 do you recommend a particularly long

47:48.480 --> 47:50.180
 or short training session?

47:50.180 --> 47:53.780
 It does intensity matter, or is it just reps?

47:53.780 --> 47:58.260
 Yeah, I think, no, it's not a volume-driven exercise.

47:58.260 --> 48:00.100
 It's a quality-driven exercise.

48:00.100 --> 48:02.700
 And listen, my expertise is not in motor learning

48:02.700 --> 48:04.740
 and motor skill acquisition.

48:04.740 --> 48:07.340
 I tend to default to Dr. Gabrielle Wolf

48:07.340 --> 48:10.380
 here at UNLV for that.

48:10.380 --> 48:12.420
 She's one of the leading proponents in this area.

48:12.420 --> 48:17.100
 But if you look at true skill development,

48:17.100 --> 48:21.380
 it is about rehearsal of accurate movement,

48:21.380 --> 48:23.100
 accurate movement mechanics.

48:23.980 --> 48:27.660
 And as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue

48:27.660 --> 48:29.340
 or inaccurate movement,

48:29.340 --> 48:32.500
 you're now losing the motor learning.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.420
 You're losing the accuracy of the skill

48:34.420 --> 48:36.100
 that people can call it muscle memory

48:36.100 --> 48:37.100
 or whatever they want, right?

48:37.100 --> 48:40.320
 But essentially, you're grooving neural axons

48:40.320 --> 48:42.160
 to create movement patterns,

48:42.160 --> 48:44.940
 and they're situational throughout sport, right?

48:44.940 --> 48:46.580
 Whether it's a cruyff turn in soccer

48:46.580 --> 48:49.620
 or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line,

48:49.620 --> 48:52.780
 you can carve out that particular posture

48:52.780 --> 48:55.380
 and position and skill, and you can isolate it,

48:55.380 --> 48:57.460
 and you can drill it again and again and again.

48:57.460 --> 49:01.980
 Now, as soon as fatigue is influencing that repetition,

49:01.980 --> 49:03.900
 it's time to stop.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.700
 And the best coaches understand that.

49:05.700 --> 49:08.340
 They understand that it's quality over quantity

49:08.340 --> 49:10.260
 when it comes to skill acquisition.

49:10.260 --> 49:12.620
 So to answer your question in a roundabout way,

49:12.620 --> 49:15.840
 I would say, yes, it's shorter sessions

49:15.840 --> 49:17.780
 that are very high quality.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.780
 And I think the best athletes, in my experience,

49:20.780 --> 49:24.520
 are the ones that consciously and cognitively

49:24.520 --> 49:28.060
 are aware of it at every moment of the training session.

49:28.060 --> 49:29.980
 They should leave the training session

49:29.980 --> 49:31.820
 not necessarily just physically fatigued,

49:31.820 --> 49:34.420
 but mentally fatigued because they're completely engaged

49:34.420 --> 49:36.700
 in the learning process.

49:36.700 --> 49:39.220
 The problem then becomes, okay,

49:39.220 --> 49:42.440
 if we just do lots of 30-minute sessions,

49:42.440 --> 49:44.400
 we've gotta do a lot of 30-minute sessions

49:44.400 --> 49:47.740
 to get the volume exposure of the repetition

49:47.740 --> 49:50.620
 and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again.

49:50.620 --> 49:51.640
 So it's a bit of a paradox.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.540
 It's a bit of a double-edged sword.

49:53.540 --> 49:57.260
 But a three-hour session versus a 90-minute session,

49:57.260 --> 49:59.880
 we'll take the 90-minute session any day

49:59.880 --> 50:01.420
 when it comes to skill acquisition

50:01.420 --> 50:04.380
 because that's going to be driven by quality over quantity.

50:04.380 --> 50:06.420
 Yeah, training and skill learning

50:06.420 --> 50:09.700
 is incredibly mentally fatiguing.

50:09.700 --> 50:13.020
 I've often wondered why when one works out hard,

50:13.020 --> 50:15.620
 whether or not it's with a run or with the weights,

50:15.620 --> 50:17.900
 why it's hard to think later in the day.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.740
 Right.

50:18.740 --> 50:21.460
 Yeah, there really does seem to be something to it.

50:21.460 --> 50:26.460
 And I've wondered, is it depletion of adrenaline, dopamine?

50:26.460 --> 50:28.460
 I sometimes think it might be dopamine.

50:28.460 --> 50:29.900
 And here I'm totally speculating.

50:29.900 --> 50:31.300
 I don't have any data to support this.

50:31.300 --> 50:35.880
 But if you hit a really hard workout or run early in the day

50:35.880 --> 50:38.300
 oftentimes the brain just doesn't want

50:38.300 --> 50:39.860
 to do hard mental work,

50:39.860 --> 50:41.980
 which gives me great admiration for these athletes

50:41.980 --> 50:45.160
 that are drilling their mind and body all day, every day

50:46.280 --> 50:47.120
 with breaks.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.460
 But so what are your thoughts?

50:48.460 --> 50:53.220
 What leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance?

50:53.220 --> 50:54.740
 Well, again, I don't want to talk out,

50:54.740 --> 50:56.860
 you know, I'm talking to the man here, you know, this-

50:56.860 --> 50:59.820
 Well, we're just two scientists speculating on this point.

50:59.820 --> 51:02.460
 Up until now, you've been giving us concrete

51:03.460 --> 51:06.300
 peer-reviewed study-based feedback on my questions.

51:06.300 --> 51:07.860
 But if we were to speculate,

51:07.860 --> 51:09.040
 I mean, I think this is a common occurrence.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.940
 People think if I get that really good workout

51:10.940 --> 51:12.780
 in in the morning, I feel better all day.

51:12.780 --> 51:16.380
 That's true, unless that workout is really intense

51:16.380 --> 51:17.580
 or really long.

51:17.580 --> 51:20.780
 And then you just, the mind just somehow

51:20.780 --> 51:25.100
 won't latch on to mental work quite as well.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.620
 I mean, just philosophically, you know,

51:27.620 --> 51:30.660
 I think there's a coming back to this kind

51:30.660 --> 51:32.180
 of stress consideration, you know,

51:32.180 --> 51:34.380
 like a public speaking or taking an exam.

51:34.380 --> 51:37.620
 I mean, if you have an amazing coach

51:37.620 --> 51:39.520
 who is setting up training in a particular way,

51:39.520 --> 51:40.620
 it's challenging.

51:40.620 --> 51:42.220
 There's a strain related to it.

51:42.220 --> 51:43.440
 And I'm not talking physical strain.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.900
 I'm talking figuring things out, you know,

51:45.900 --> 51:49.180
 figuring out the skill, and I think that can be stressful.

51:49.180 --> 51:51.420
 Like the learning process can be stressful.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.820
 So, you know, we've touched on stress.

51:53.820 --> 51:58.240
 I also think if they hit the right technique,

51:58.240 --> 52:00.060
 you know, that reward center in the brain,

52:00.060 --> 52:03.020
 that dopamine shot is gonna fly up there.

52:03.020 --> 52:05.540
 And there's only so many times that we can get that

52:05.540 --> 52:07.380
 before that becomes dampened.

52:07.380 --> 52:09.300
 And I think there's an energetic piece to it.

52:09.300 --> 52:11.620
 You know, there's the fueling of the brain.

52:11.620 --> 52:15.140
 There's the carbohydrate fueling exercise

52:15.140 --> 52:19.580
 that actually the strategy around how you fuel for learning

52:19.580 --> 52:23.340
 and fuel for physical training is actually pretty similar.

52:23.340 --> 52:24.180
 Glucose.

52:24.180 --> 52:27.460
 Yeah, it's glucose, it's sugar at the end of the day, right?

52:27.460 --> 52:30.300
 So, you know, are you fueling accordingly

52:30.300 --> 52:31.620
 around your training sessions?

52:31.620 --> 52:33.660
 Be that very physical, because everyone thinks,

52:33.660 --> 52:35.780
 okay, you know, I'm gonna jump on a treadmill

52:35.780 --> 52:40.100
 and I'm gonna bang out, you know, 15 sprints at max effort,

52:40.100 --> 52:42.740
 and I'm gonna be dropping off and lying on the floor

52:42.740 --> 52:44.700
 at the end of it, I need to refuel.

52:44.700 --> 52:47.180
 But what about the refueling of the brain

52:47.180 --> 52:51.380
 in a very demanding exercise or drilling session

52:51.380 --> 52:52.740
 where you're looking at technique

52:52.740 --> 52:54.040
 that you're trying to figure out

52:54.040 --> 52:55.600
 that's very challenging for your mind

52:55.600 --> 52:57.820
 to figure out the complexity of it,

52:57.820 --> 53:00.940
 but still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards.

53:00.940 --> 53:02.860
 And I think that's obviously, you know,

53:02.860 --> 53:05.780
 might be an area where athletes do themselves a disservice

53:05.780 --> 53:07.420
 by not appropriately fueling

53:07.420 --> 53:08.780
 from what might be considered to be

53:08.780 --> 53:10.980
 a lower intensity session,

53:10.980 --> 53:15.300
 but the cognitive challenge has been significantly high.

53:15.300 --> 53:17.420
 So they're doing skill work or drill work

53:17.420 --> 53:19.380
 and it's taxing the brain.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.060
 And they're thinking, oh, you know,

53:21.060 --> 53:24.240
 I wasn't, you know, pushing hard lifts or doing sprints,

53:24.240 --> 53:26.780
 and so I can just go off the rest of my day,

53:26.780 --> 53:29.240
 but then their mind is drifting.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.940
 Yeah, I mean, I speculate.

53:30.940 --> 53:32.940
 Yeah, that seems very reasonable.

53:32.940 --> 53:34.580
 I mean, I know that here

53:34.580 --> 53:36.660
 and presumably with the other athletes you've worked with,

53:36.660 --> 53:40.340
 nutrition is a huge aspect of that.

53:40.340 --> 53:42.300
 And I think the general public can learn a lot

53:42.300 --> 53:45.620
 from athletic nutrition because at the end of the day,

53:45.620 --> 53:47.980
 the general public is trying to attend to their kids,

53:47.980 --> 53:49.720
 attend to their work, whether or not they're lawyers

53:49.720 --> 53:53.260
 or whatever, they need to focus.

53:53.260 --> 53:55.280
 Nutrition is a barbed wire topic.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.120
 Oh yeah.

53:56.120 --> 54:00.100
 But since we're free to do what we would do

54:00.100 --> 54:01.740
 if we were just sitting in each other's offices,

54:01.740 --> 54:04.660
 which is to just speculate a bit,

54:04.660 --> 54:06.900
 for the typical person, right,

54:06.900 --> 54:10.460
 do you think these low carbohydrate diets,

54:10.460 --> 54:13.080
 typical person who exercises, runs, swims, yoga,

54:13.080 --> 54:14.780
 lifts weights, maybe not all those things,

54:14.780 --> 54:16.820
 but some collection of those,

54:16.820 --> 54:19.740
 pushes themselves to do those things and to do them well,

54:19.740 --> 54:22.580
 but isn't necessarily a highly competitive athlete?

54:22.580 --> 54:25.640
 Do you think that nutrition

54:25.640 --> 54:27.600
 that doesn't include a lot of glucose,

54:27.600 --> 54:32.020
 doesn't include a lot of carbohydrates is a problem?

54:32.020 --> 54:33.380
 Or is it okay?

54:33.380 --> 54:35.420
 What do you recommend for athletes?

54:35.420 --> 54:37.140
 What do you recommend for typical people?

54:37.140 --> 54:41.140
 Yeah, again, disclaimer, I'm not a dietician, but I-

54:41.140 --> 54:42.540
 That's okay, the dieticians don't know

54:42.540 --> 54:44.300
 what to recommend to athletes either.

54:44.300 --> 54:46.780
 And I say that from having to spend a lot of time

54:46.780 --> 54:50.160
 with the literature now, it's a complete mess.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.700
 It's like, I thought we didn't understand anything

54:51.700 --> 54:53.460
 about the brain, the nutrition science stuff

54:53.460 --> 54:55.100
 is all over the place.

54:55.100 --> 54:58.780
 So I think we have, again, a large degrees of freedom.

54:58.780 --> 54:59.620
 Right, right, right.

54:59.620 --> 55:04.340
 I mean, I think it comes down to metabolic efficiency.

55:04.340 --> 55:09.020
 So we would never advocate a high, I never say never, okay?

55:09.020 --> 55:11.800
 But we rarely advocate a high-performance athlete

55:11.800 --> 55:16.320
 in a high-intensity intermittent sport like MMA,

55:18.060 --> 55:20.100
 being totally ketogenic or being-

55:20.100 --> 55:21.220
 You do not recommend that?

55:21.220 --> 55:22.460
 No, because at the end of the day,

55:22.460 --> 55:24.900
 some of those high-intensity efforts

55:25.860 --> 55:28.500
 usually require carbohydrate fueling

55:28.500 --> 55:33.500
 for the energy produced at those high intensities.

55:34.460 --> 55:36.840
 So we try to navigate around that.

55:36.840 --> 55:39.580
 Now, listen, there are fighters in the UFC and elsewhere.

55:39.580 --> 55:41.540
 Matt Brown is a great example

55:41.540 --> 55:45.360
 who promotes the ketogenic approach and it works for him.

55:45.360 --> 55:48.500
 But we look at the science and the nature,

55:48.500 --> 55:49.700
 the characteristics of our sport

55:49.700 --> 55:51.040
 and we don't necessarily promote that.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.300
 Can I interrupt you real quick?

55:52.300 --> 55:54.580
 What about ketones for people

55:54.580 --> 55:56.620
 that are ingesting carbohydrates?

55:56.620 --> 55:57.700
 This is an interesting area

55:57.700 --> 55:59.540
 because people always hear ketones and they think,

55:59.540 --> 56:02.820
 oh, I have to be ketogenic to benefit from taking ketones.

56:02.820 --> 56:04.180
 But there are a number of athletes

56:04.180 --> 56:07.360
 and recreational athletes now as well,

56:07.360 --> 56:11.340
 taking liquid or powder-based ketones

56:11.340 --> 56:13.860
 even though they do eat rice and oatmeal

56:13.860 --> 56:15.780
 and bread and other things.

56:15.780 --> 56:19.180
 So are there any known benefits of ketones

56:19.180 --> 56:21.940
 even if one is not in a state of ketosis?

56:21.940 --> 56:26.940
 So the use of ketones I'm primarily aware of in our sport

56:29.940 --> 56:32.860
 is after the event in terms of the brain health

56:32.860 --> 56:36.460
 with athletes potentially taking trauma to the brain, et cetera

56:36.460 --> 56:39.100
 and looking to maintain the fueling

56:39.100 --> 56:40.900
 and the energy supply to the brain.

56:40.900 --> 56:43.120
 But yes, it's probably a little bit out of my remit

56:43.120 --> 56:45.000
 so I don't wanna talk on that

56:45.000 --> 56:46.940
 because I'm not fully familiar with that.

56:46.940 --> 56:49.820
 Well, I've heard that ketones after head injury

56:49.820 --> 56:51.500
 can provide a buffering component.

56:51.500 --> 56:52.340
 Correct.

56:52.340 --> 56:53.360
 It's not gonna reverse brain damage

56:53.360 --> 56:56.020
 but it might be able to offset some of the micro damage.

56:56.020 --> 57:00.020
 Right, so that's how we use it just to sustain

57:00.020 --> 57:01.980
 the energy supply to the brain

57:01.980 --> 57:04.940
 that might be compromised through brain trauma.

57:04.940 --> 57:07.500
 So that's why we use ketones.

57:07.500 --> 57:08.860
 To come back to the original question,

57:08.860 --> 57:11.380
 if it's a general population, then yes,

57:11.380 --> 57:13.180
 I think there's a place to argue

57:13.180 --> 57:15.860
 that actually being on a ketogenic diet at times

57:15.860 --> 57:17.940
 and maybe it's a cycling exercise,

57:17.940 --> 57:19.940
 maybe not, I don't mean cycling a bike,

57:19.940 --> 57:23.860
 I mean cycling ketosis is beneficial

57:23.860 --> 57:25.180
 because I think it's gonna lead

57:25.180 --> 57:29.000
 to better metabolic management and metabolic efficiency.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.760
 Those lower intensities where we should be fueling

57:31.760 --> 57:35.740
 our metabolism with lipids and fats,

57:35.740 --> 57:39.300
 clearly the Western diet and the modern day diets

57:39.300 --> 57:42.860
 is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates

57:42.860 --> 57:45.820
 that people become predisposed to utilization

57:45.820 --> 57:50.820
 of that fuel source above lipids use, fat use,

57:51.180 --> 57:52.700
 intensities that are very low.

57:52.700 --> 57:56.420
 So some of our data with the fighters shows that as well.

57:56.420 --> 57:59.340
 But I think the challenge for us is that we're working

57:59.340 --> 58:03.300
 with a clientele that require high intensity bouts of effort

58:03.300 --> 58:07.040
 so fueling appropriately is very important for that.

58:07.040 --> 58:11.860
 Now we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes

58:11.860 --> 58:16.380
 on what you would say kind of is it a largely ketogenic diet

58:16.380 --> 58:20.420
 but then we will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions.

58:20.420 --> 58:23.620
 So we'll do very timed exposure to carbohydrates.

58:23.620 --> 58:24.440
 So it's not-

58:24.440 --> 58:25.280
 Post training.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.860
 Post training, immediately pre, during

58:27.860 --> 58:29.220
 and then immediately post.

58:29.220 --> 58:30.780
 And then the rest of their diets,

58:30.780 --> 58:33.420
 breakfast, lunch and dinner are what would look

58:33.420 --> 58:35.780
 like ketogenic type approaches.

58:35.780 --> 58:38.260
 So we're trying to be very tactical in the exposure

58:38.260 --> 58:41.420
 to maximize the intensity for the training

58:41.420 --> 58:44.860
 and then return to a metabolically efficient diet

58:44.860 --> 58:47.780
 which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate

58:47.780 --> 58:50.860
 because we've fueled the sessions that need it.

58:50.860 --> 58:54.580
 I'm smiling because once again, this place,

58:54.580 --> 58:57.860
 the UFC Performance Center is doing things scientifically

58:57.860 --> 59:01.900
 which to me, the idea, and I'm pleased to hear that

59:01.900 --> 59:04.500
 because to me, this idea that the ketogenic diet

59:04.500 --> 59:07.340
 is the best and only diet or carbohydrates

59:07.340 --> 59:11.100
 and low protein diets are the best diet, it's ludicrous.

59:11.100 --> 59:13.320
 But then you mentioned metabolic efficiency.

59:13.320 --> 59:16.020
 I think some people might be familiar with that term,

59:16.020 --> 59:19.220
 some perhaps not, but the way I understand

59:19.220 --> 59:22.980
 metabolic efficiency is that you teach the body

59:22.980 --> 59:27.980
 to use fats by maybe doing long bouts of cardio,

59:28.540 --> 59:30.180
 maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit.

59:30.180 --> 59:32.500
 So teaching the body to tap into its fat stores

59:32.500 --> 59:34.400
 for certain periods of training.

59:34.400 --> 59:37.620
 And then you also teach the body to utilize carbohydrates

59:37.620 --> 59:40.220
 by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training

59:40.220 --> 59:43.140
 and before training, you teach the body to use ketones

59:43.140 --> 59:44.820
 and then you use them at the appropriate time

59:44.820 --> 59:47.260
 as opposed to just deciding that one of these fuel sources

59:47.260 --> 59:50.020
 is good and all the others are bad or dispensable.

59:50.020 --> 59:51.140
 Do I have that correct?

59:51.140 --> 59:51.960
 You nailed it.

59:51.960 --> 59:56.960
 I mean, from Bob Seabahar, formerly of USA Triathlon,

59:57.660 --> 59:59.140
 is the guy that kind of came up

59:59.140 --> 1:00:02.660
 with the concept of metabolic efficiency.

1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:04.140
 But yes, you're absolutely right.

1:00:04.140 --> 1:00:07.260
 I mean, at low intensities of exercise

1:00:07.260 --> 1:00:09.800
 or just day-to-day living, we shouldn't be tapping

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:13.980
 into our carbohydrate fuel sources extensively.

1:00:13.980 --> 1:00:16.440
 That's for higher intensity work

1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:19.960
 or the fight or flight needs of stress.

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:26.120
 If athletes or any individual has a high carbohydrate diet,

1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:29.340
 they're gonna start to become predisposed

1:00:29.340 --> 1:00:32.580
 to utilizing that fuel source preferentially.

1:00:32.580 --> 1:00:34.840
 Now at low intensity, that can be problematic,

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:35.900
 certainly for an athlete,

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:39.460
 because if they preferentially use carbohydrate

1:00:39.460 --> 1:00:42.820
 at lower intensities, when the exercise demand

1:00:42.820 --> 1:00:44.100
 goes to a higher intensity,

1:00:44.100 --> 1:00:46.420
 they've already exhausted their fuel stores.

1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:47.740
 They can't draw upon fat

1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:51.040
 because the oxidization of that fat is just too slow.

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.580
 So they're essentially now become fatigued

1:00:53.580 --> 1:00:56.700
 because they've already utilized the carbohydrate stores.

1:00:56.700 --> 1:00:59.420
 So what we try to do, yes, through diet manipulation

1:00:59.420 --> 1:01:02.260
 and a little bit of exercise manipulation is, as you say,

1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:03.780
 teach the body or train the body

1:01:03.780 --> 1:01:06.540
 to preferentially use a specific fuel source.

1:01:06.540 --> 1:01:08.220
 Fat, obviously, at lower intensities

1:01:08.220 --> 1:01:09.820
 and carbohydrate at high intensities.

1:01:09.820 --> 1:01:12.300
 And we look at specifically the crossover point

1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:14.020
 between the two tells a lot

1:01:14.020 --> 1:01:17.220
 in terms of how an athlete is ultimately,

1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:18.900
 how their metabolism is working.

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:21.320
 Well, again, I'm smiling because I love this

1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:25.060
 because it's grounded in something real and scientific,

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:26.980
 which is that we have these different fuel sources.

1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:29.220
 The body can adapt to use any number of them

1:01:29.220 --> 1:01:30.240
 or one of them.

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:33.480
 I think most people are looking for that one pattern

1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:35.440
 of eating, that one pattern of exercising

1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:38.160
 that's gonna be best for them or sustain them.

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.340
 And they often look back to the time

1:01:41.340 --> 1:01:42.540
 when they felt so much better

1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:44.060
 switching from one thing to the next.

1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:47.380
 But the adaptation process itself is also key, right?

1:01:47.380 --> 1:01:48.420
 Teaching the body.

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:53.780
 So if we were to just riff on this just a little bit further

1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:57.100
 if somebody, I'll use myself as an example

1:01:57.100 --> 1:01:59.460
 since I can only speculate

1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:02.820
 what other people's current nutrition protocols are.

1:02:02.820 --> 1:02:05.540
 But if somebody is eating in a particular way

1:02:05.540 --> 1:02:07.980
 and they want to try this kind of periodization

1:02:07.980 --> 1:02:11.820
 of nutrition, could one say, okay, for a few weeks

1:02:11.820 --> 1:02:13.960
 I'm going to do more high intensity interval training

1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:14.800
 and weight training,

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:16.180
 and I'm going to eat a bit more carbohydrate

1:02:16.180 --> 1:02:17.780
 because I'm depleting more glycogen.

1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:20.620
 Then if I switch to a phase of my training

1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:22.720
 where I'm doing some longer runs,

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:24.220
 maybe I'm training less,

1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:26.620
 maybe I'm just working at my desk a little bit more,

1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:29.020
 then I might switch to a lower carbohydrate diet.

1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:29.860
 Do I have that right?

1:02:29.860 --> 1:02:32.900
 And then if I'm going to enter a competition of some sort,

1:02:32.900 --> 1:02:36.600
 certainly not UFC or MMA of any kind to be clear,

1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.640
 not because it isn't a wonderful sport,

1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:42.800
 but because that wouldn't be good for my other profession.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:45.080
 But if I were going to do that,

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:47.700
 then I would think about stacking carbohydrates,

1:02:47.700 --> 1:02:50.260
 ketones, and fats.

1:02:50.260 --> 1:02:51.880
 Do I have that more or less right?

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:53.600
 I think, yeah, you said it eloquently.

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:54.520
 At the end of the day,

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:57.040
 you're consciously understanding

1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:01.920
 what the exposure to physical exertion is,

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:04.000
 and you're flexing your diet accordingly.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.440
 So it's need-based eating.

1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:07.520
 Exactly, and for one of the better terms,

1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:09.640
 you can call it whatever fancy terminology

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:10.460
 there is out there,

1:03:10.460 --> 1:03:13.640
 but yes, it's needs-based eating,

1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:15.720
 but you're very conscious and cognizant

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.520
 of what is my current exercise status.

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:20.760
 If I'm taking some time off,

1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:22.920
 then don't gorge on the carbohydrates.

1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:24.000
 We probably need to be cut.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.660
 It's going to be lower intensity work

1:03:25.660 --> 1:03:28.400
 or even just habitual day-to-day walking around,

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:29.740
 doing your groceries.

1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:33.380
 That doesn't require massive amounts of glycogen storage

1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:36.480
 and carbohydrate fueling.

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:39.840
 So you can potentially go more ketogenic in nature,

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:43.440
 oxidizing lipids for that fuel.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.980
 If you are in a high period of high-intensity training,

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:49.960
 then you have to consciously flex your diet to support that.

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:50.800
 That's not normal.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:52.640
 You've made a change.

1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:54.040
 You've elevated the demand.

1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:56.640
 So the fueling requirements for the regenerative,

1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:58.040
 not only fueling the exercise,

1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:00.120
 but the regenerative requirements of your body

1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:01.320
 after that type of work

1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:03.040
 is going to be really important as well.

1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:04.960
 So yes, take on more carbohydrates.

1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:08.040
 So I think it's consciously interpreting

1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:09.740
 the nature of your diet against what,

1:04:09.740 --> 1:04:11.720
 where you are at any moment in time.

1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:12.680
 Yeah, I like that.

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:15.000
 I think the listeners of my podcast

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.480
 generally are experimenters.

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:18.960
 They are scientists of themselves,

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:21.640
 which makes me happy, obviously.

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:24.000
 And I like to think that they're paying attention

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.560
 to the changes they're making

1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:27.660
 and how they're affecting themselves.

1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:31.040
 And they seem more open to trying things,

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:33.360
 provided they can do it safely, you know,

1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:35.420
 and seeing what works for them.

1:04:35.420 --> 1:04:38.040
 And I'm certainly going to try some of the change up.

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:40.120
 I also am really a creature of habit.

1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:41.840
 And I think the, talking to you today,

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:43.440
 I realize I'm probably doing a number of things

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.220
 truly wrong in my training,

1:04:45.220 --> 1:04:48.260
 but also that I don't tend to vary my nutrition

1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:50.080
 with my training quite as much as I should.

1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:52.380
 I'm just locked into a protocol.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:55.440
 We covered a number of things

1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:57.600
 related to your PhD thesis work.

1:04:57.600 --> 1:04:59.720
 And then, but I cut you off early on

1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:01.680
 related to your trajectory.

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:03.580
 After you finished your thesis,

1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:06.480
 I know you were at Notre Dame for a while.

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:09.800
 Was that your first spot after your PhD thesis?

1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:13.400
 No, no, I basically finished my PhD

1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:15.640
 and I dropped into the British Olympic system

1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:17.040
 for about 14 years.

1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:17.880
 Oh my, okay.

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.680
 I was with, you know,

1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:23.480
 I've done three full Olympic cycles with different sports

1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:26.240
 and largely a strength and conditioning coach

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:27.840
 as a practitioner.

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:31.200
 I was always working in universities and academia alongside,

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:35.080
 you know, in terms of continuing to publish and write

1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:37.120
 and do research and teach as well,

1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:37.960
 because I enjoy teaching. That explains

1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:40.000
 the huge volume of publications.

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.680
 I don't think people realize the work

1:05:41.680 --> 1:05:44.780
 that goes into getting a quality peer-reviewed publication.

1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:47.320
 It's not, what do they call it now on Instagram?

1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:49.280
 Anecdata, where people would do something,

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:51.240
 want, you know, they have this experience

1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:53.560
 and then they put it in the world that...

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:56.040
 Anecdata are, I don't even know that

1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:57.320
 we should call it data,

1:05:57.320 --> 1:06:01.600
 but so 14 years working with the British Olympic team?

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:03.200
 Yeah, so with, you know,

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:04.800
 whether it was GB boxing,

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:08.740
 primarily with the Rio, excuse me, the Beijing cycle,

1:06:08.740 --> 1:06:11.400
 but also lightweight rowers and gymnastics.

1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:13.480
 And for the London Olympic games,

1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:16.120
 that cycle I was the lead strength and conditioning

1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:18.320
 and physical performance coach for British basketball,

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.400
 so GB basketball.

1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:23.640
 I had about three years in the English Premier League

1:06:23.640 --> 1:06:26.600
 with Newcastle United and the soccer team.

1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:28.360
 And then for the Rio Olympic cycle,

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:29.760
 I was with Great Britain Taekwondo.

1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:32.520
 So again, another combat sport.

1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.040
 After I'd finished there,

1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:37.080
 I kind of moved to the University of Notre Dame

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:40.880
 where I went into more of a managerial position

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:43.640
 working across all the different technical services,

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:45.880
 medical, nutrition, strength and conditioning,

1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:48.440
 you know, psychology, whatever, sports science,

1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:50.120
 whatever it may be,

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:53.960
 as the director of performance sciences

1:06:53.960 --> 1:06:55.520
 for Notre Dame athletics.

1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:57.480
 And then after about 16 months there,

1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:59.080
 the UFC came knocking

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:01.000
 and they recruited me out of Notre Dame.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.160
 So it's been a great ride.

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.520
 And lots of, you know, I've got, you know,

1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:08.200
 lots of athletes have taught me a lot along the way,

1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:10.520
 lots of coaches, you know, every day is a school day.

1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:12.880
 I still try and keep that mentality.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:14.160
 And, you know, in this world,

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:16.280
 we call it white belt mentality.

1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:18.960
 You know, it's, you know, I'm a PhD.

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:22.120
 I've got 25 years of experience in high performance sport,

1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:25.080
 but I still learn every single day

1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:27.080
 from these people out on the mats and in the ring.

1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:28.800
 And it's impressive to see what they do.

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:29.740
 Yeah, it certainly is.

1:07:29.740 --> 1:07:32.800
 I got introduced to MMA just a few years ago.

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:34.240
 I think the first time I came out here

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.480
 was one of the first times I'd heard of MMA

1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:38.240
 because I was kind of in my laboratory and, you know,

1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:39.200
 nose down.

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:40.760
 And it's a really interesting sport

1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:43.960
 because it incorporates so many different types of movement

1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:46.600
 as you said, you know, it's not just stand-up boxing,

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.260
 it's just kicking, it's, you know, ground game, everything.

1:07:49.260 --> 1:07:52.000
 And I'm still learning about it.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.080
 But as you mentioned, going in with that beginner's mind,

1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:59.400
 the white belt mentality,

1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.220
 what has been the most surprising thing for you

1:08:03.220 --> 1:08:05.880
 in terms of being exposed to MMA in particular,

1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:06.960
 as opposed to other sports?

1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:09.040
 Like what's unique about MMA fighters

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:11.040
 besides that they have this huge variety

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:16.040
 of tactical skills that they have to learn and perfect?

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:19.720
 Yeah, that's a great question.

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:20.560
 I would say two things.

1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:21.560
 I'm going to answer two questions.

1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.480
 One actually reiterates what you've already said.

1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:26.520
 Like the degrees of freedom in mixed martial arts

1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:30.040
 are exponential, like no other sports, you know.

1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:32.000
 We've got 11 different weight classes.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.080
 We have men's classes, we have women's classes,

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:37.000
 we have, you know, kickboxers, wrestlers,

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.040
 jiu-jitsu fighters, judokas, you know,

1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:40.460
 like karate fighters, you know,

1:08:40.460 --> 1:08:42.840
 the stylistic backgrounds are infinite.

1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:46.080
 And we have, we're a weight classification sport.

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.400
 There's a whole issue relating to making weight

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:51.800
 and then rebounding to fight about 24 to 30 hours.

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.880
 Like just the variability in this sport,

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:59.500
 the considerations that you have to make are unprecedented

1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:02.240
 compared to any other sport that I've worked with.

1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:06.320
 And a lot of them go against and are the antithesis

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:08.760
 of what you would expect for a high performance.

1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:12.540
 You know, in terms of we don't always have

1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:15.080
 a very clearly defined competition schedule.

1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:16.280
 You know, once these guys fight,

1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:17.580
 they don't necessarily know

1:09:17.580 --> 1:09:18.760
 when their next fight's going to be.

1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:20.880
 What's the closest spacing of a fight?

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:23.800
 I mean, listen, I think the record is around,

1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:27.280
 it's just over a month, I believe.

1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:28.360
 Goodness.

1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:30.080
 So, you know, that's a quick turnaround,

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.260
 but most of these guys are fighting, you know,

1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:33.600
 three or four times a year,

1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:36.280
 three times a year is pretty normal.

1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:39.040
 The bigger fights, maybe two times a year.

1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:40.920
 But invariably the guys don't know

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:42.900
 when that next date is going to be.

1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:45.600
 So we're in this gray area of, okay, what do we do?

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:47.380
 Like, are we taking some time off?

1:09:47.380 --> 1:09:49.220
 Are we just going to do some general prep work?

1:09:49.220 --> 1:09:52.820
 Are we going to try and keep the knife sharpened

1:09:52.820 --> 1:09:53.660
 in case I get-

1:09:53.660 --> 1:09:54.480
 I didn't realize this,

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.880
 in that way it's a lot like special operations.

1:09:56.880 --> 1:09:57.720
 Absolutely.

1:09:57.720 --> 1:09:59.080
 You don't know when the call's going to happen.

1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:00.680
 They have to be ready at all times.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:02.720
 There isn't this like, let's get ready for season.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:03.540
 Right.

1:10:03.540 --> 1:10:06.160
 Yeah, like when I was with the British Olympic Association,

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:08.280
 you know, I knew it was the British Open,

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:09.920
 the Spanish Open, the French Open,

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:11.920
 the European Championships, the Israeli Open,

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.360
 the American Open, the Canadian Open, the Olympic Games.

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.200
 You know, I could-

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:16.080
 It's a circuit in your brain.

1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:16.920
 Right.

1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:18.800
 You just plan like, you know,

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:20.000
 where all the targets are going to be.

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.620
 Here, it's a moving target

1:10:21.620 --> 1:10:23.280
 because you might be just hanging out

1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:24.400
 doing some general prep work

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:26.200
 and then you might get a short notice fight

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:27.080
 that give you a quick call

1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:28.680
 and it's in six weeks or five weeks.

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:31.480
 And okay, I've got to ramp everything up really quickly.

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:33.760
 So that's a real challenge

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:37.400
 in terms of just managing all these different components

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.740
 of mixed martial arts alone.

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:42.100
 To come back to your question,

1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:44.760
 the other thing which is truly fascinating

1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:46.440
 about these individuals

1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:49.280
 is their, just their mental resilience.

1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:51.040
 And again, we've touched on it in the talk,

1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.200
 but you know, the ability to do what they do

1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:54.600
 on a daily basis,

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:57.840
 to look at all the different skillsets

1:10:57.840 --> 1:10:59.440
 that they have to try and engage in

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:01.720
 and bring into their training,

1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:04.440
 to do that and embrace the grind,

1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:07.320
 embrace the process of just learning.

1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:10.520
 The physical side of our sport is unprecedented,

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.480
 but the mental side, you know,

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:13.320
 we have a funny saying here,

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:17.520
 I always say it's 90% mental apart from the 60%

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:18.480
 that's physical.

1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:21.480
 So, you know, it's just more and more and more.

1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:26.480
 And these guys' ability to just do that on a daily basis

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.440
 is very impressive.

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:29.480
 Like their resilience,

1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:32.000
 their internal drive and their resilience

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.200
 is really impressive to see.

1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:35.480
 Yeah, all the fighters I've met here

1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:36.560
 have been really terrific.

1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:37.960
 It's interesting.

1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:39.040
 Every time I meet a fighter,

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:41.360
 how often I shouldn't be surprising

1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:42.880
 where they're often very soft-spoken.

1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:43.720
 Right.

1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:44.560
 Always extremely polite.

1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:45.400
 Yeah, yeah.

1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:47.320
 And fighting is such a, you know,

1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:50.720
 it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain, right?

1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:52.520
 But a large portion of the brain nonetheless.

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:54.800
 But I think that's another skill is that switch, you know?

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:57.440
 And again, that's the recoverability piece, right?

1:11:57.440 --> 1:11:59.320
 Like you cannot be type A

1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:03.360
 or you cannot be like supercharged 24 hours a day

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:05.680
 because you're going to just fry your system, right?

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:06.840
 And I think that's something else

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:08.960
 where we're really trying to manage this whole process,

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:11.200
 be it through nutritional interventions,

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:12.920
 be it through education around sleep,

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:16.560
 be it through training program management,

1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:19.000
 be it through psychological interventions.

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.280
 You know, you could look at fights and say,

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:22.480
 like, these guys are gone.

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:24.960
 Like they're red alert and they'll run through a brick wall.

1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:28.200
 But actually, again, their ability to turn it on and off

1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:30.160
 means that they can do what they do.

1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:33.200
 You know, they can bring it down and be very normal,

1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.160
 very polite, very accommodating.

1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:38.600
 Maybe even better than most people

1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.600
 because, you know, one of the reasons I'm obsessed

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:42.760
 with human performance and high performance

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:46.160
 and people like fighters and, you know, elite military

1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:48.440
 or even bodybuilders for that matter

1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:51.200
 is that they experiment.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:53.720
 They find the outer limits of what's possible.

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.360
 But one of the things that they have discovered

1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:58.640
 as you're describing is this ability to toggle

1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:01.040
 between high alert states and calm states.

1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:03.680
 Most typical people can't do this.

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:05.760
 They see something that upsets them on the internet

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:06.960
 or something on the news

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:09.400
 or some external event pressures down on them

1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:11.280
 and they're stressed for many, many days and weeks.

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:13.480
 And sometimes it goes pathological, right?

1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:15.600
 And I don't say this as a criticism.

1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:19.440
 It's just that most human beings within our species,

1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:21.400
 most members of our species never learn

1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:23.460
 to either flip the switch

1:13:23.460 --> 1:13:26.440
 or to just voluntarily toggle between states.

1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:29.700
 I think athletes learn how to do that extremely well.

1:13:29.700 --> 1:13:33.020
 And it sounds like MMA fighters do that even better

1:13:33.020 --> 1:13:35.220
 than perhaps many other athletes.

1:13:35.220 --> 1:13:37.240
 I mean, yeah, there's the odd one or two

1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:38.080
 that we'd struggle with.

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:41.040
 But I think in terms of that chronic exposure,

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:44.260
 we see that coming from challenges

1:13:44.260 --> 1:13:46.080
 around cyclical weight cutting

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:48.300
 and metabolic disruption and metabolic injury,

1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:50.600
 not necessarily from the psychological drive.

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.200
 They do understand that this is a job for them

1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:57.300
 and the time on the mats.

1:13:57.300 --> 1:13:59.520
 Most of them can turn it off a little bit

1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:02.000
 and downgrade things when they're off the mats.

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.980
 It's impressive to see.

1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:05.640
 Because again, like as a layman,

1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:08.720
 just looking at the fight game, you think,

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:11.760
 it's going to be crazy chaotic, 100 miles an hour,

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:13.200
 every hour of every day.

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:15.520
 But that's clearly not the case.

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:20.200
 They manage their energy and their efforts pretty well.

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:21.440
 So it's a little bit like science,

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:23.360
 although maybe scientists could take a lesson from it.

1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:25.280
 Yeah, it's evidence-based practice

1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:26.680
 or practice-based evidence, right?

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.800
 I like that, that's good.

1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:29.680
 A couple more questions.

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:31.080
 I can't help myself.

1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:33.080
 I know we talked about temperature earlier

1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:34.240
 when we discussed cold,

1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:36.040
 but I can't help myself.

1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:37.840
 I have to ask you about heat.

1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:40.240
 Because earlier we were having a conversation

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:41.760
 about heat adaptation,

1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:46.440
 about how long does it take for the human body or athlete

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:48.960
 or typical person that's maybe exploring sauna

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:52.920
 or things of that sort to learn to be a better sweater.

1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:55.000
 It sounds like something none of us would want to do.

1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:56.780
 We all want to stay cool, calm, and collected.

1:14:56.780 --> 1:14:59.280
 But one of the reasons to deliberately expose oneself

1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:03.760
 to heat is for things like growth hormone release, et cetera.

1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:04.600
 We can talk about this.

1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.460
 But a couple of questions.

1:15:06.460 --> 1:15:08.600
 One, is heat exposure stress

1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:11.320
 in the same way that the ice bath

1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:13.400
 or cold exposure is stress?

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:15.800
 The second one, is there any difference there

1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:16.640
 that's important?

1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.040
 And the other one is,

1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:20.440
 how does one get better at heat adaptation?

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:21.860
 Or at least what are you doing with the fighters

1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:24.040
 to get them better at dealing with heat?

1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:24.860
 How long does that take?

1:15:24.860 --> 1:15:25.920
 So the first question,

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:28.200
 just because I threw three questions at you,

1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:33.200
 is, was, you know, is heat stress like cold is stress?

1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:34.260
 Yeah, I think it is.

1:15:34.260 --> 1:15:36.460
 And I think, you know, heat shock proteins, for example,

1:15:36.460 --> 1:15:39.240
 are driven by that stressful exposure

1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.540
 to a changing environment.

1:15:41.540 --> 1:15:42.960
 So I think, you know,

1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:47.400
 we do graded response in terms of heat acclimation

1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:50.160
 strategies, but yes,

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:52.040
 we've touched on it earlier in the conversation.

1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:54.260
 For me, heat is still a stressor.

1:15:54.260 --> 1:15:56.980
 And if it's managed incorrectly,

1:15:56.980 --> 1:15:59.580
 you can have detrimental responses

1:15:59.580 --> 1:16:01.100
 rather than beneficial responses.

1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:03.240
 So barring like hyperthermia and death,

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:05.120
 like, I mean, obviously you heat up the brain too much,

1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:07.260
 people will have seizures and die,

1:16:07.260 --> 1:16:09.000
 but you lose neurons.

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.440
 But what's the right way to acclimate heat?

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.380
 Taking into account that people are, you know,

1:16:14.380 --> 1:16:16.120
 should check with their doctor, et cetera,

1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:17.380
 we do all these disclaimers.

1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:19.140
 But, you know, but let's say I,

1:16:19.140 --> 1:16:21.660
 let's just say I want to get better at dealing with heat

1:16:21.660 --> 1:16:24.020
 or I want to extract more benefit from heat.

1:16:24.020 --> 1:16:25.580
 Is, I mean, how many minutes a day

1:16:25.580 --> 1:16:27.740
 are people typically exposing themselves to heat?

1:16:27.740 --> 1:16:30.300
 How often and over what periods of time?

1:16:30.300 --> 1:16:32.180
 Yeah, so we normally start

1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:34.000
 with about 15 minutes of exposure.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.380
 Now, if someone's really lacking acclimation to heat,

1:16:37.380 --> 1:16:40.060
 you know, you can do that in three, five minute efforts.

1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:40.900
 Do you know what I mean?

1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:41.740
 And actually take time-

1:16:41.740 --> 1:16:42.560
 This is hot, hot sauna.

1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:43.400
 Yeah, hot sauna.

1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:44.240
 Take time to step-

1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:45.900
 200 degrees or something like Fahrenheit.

1:16:45.900 --> 1:16:48.100
 Yeah, yeah, 200 Fahrenheit, yes.

1:16:48.100 --> 1:16:51.320
 And we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes

1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:53.940
 to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous.

1:16:53.940 --> 1:16:56.540
 Now we have to understand, you know,

1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:59.980
 what's the advantage of heat acclimation for our athletes?

1:16:59.980 --> 1:17:02.380
 Ultimately, their ability to sweat

1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:05.180
 and to lose, you know, body fluids

1:17:05.180 --> 1:17:08.900
 is going to be advantageous to their weight cut process,

1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:10.180
 their ability to make weight.

1:17:10.180 --> 1:17:11.620
 It is a technique that these guys,

1:17:11.620 --> 1:17:12.660
 some of these guys adopt.

1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:16.220
 So if you don't have, you know, high sweat rates,

1:17:16.220 --> 1:17:18.120
 it means you're going to have to sit in the sauna

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:19.660
 for longer and longer and longer

1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:23.500
 to get the same delta in sweat release.

1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:25.060
 So the more acclimated you are,

1:17:25.060 --> 1:17:28.380
 the more your body is thermogenically adapted,

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:29.940
 the more sweat glands you have,

1:17:29.940 --> 1:17:32.740
 the smaller pores, you can sweat more

1:17:32.740 --> 1:17:34.620
 and therefore you'll lose that fluid quicker

1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:36.220
 and you spend less time in the sauna.

1:17:36.220 --> 1:17:38.580
 So that's why we do it,

1:17:38.580 --> 1:17:42.340
 to try and promote, to limit the exposure.

1:17:42.340 --> 1:17:43.780
 And it comes back to your first question,

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:45.140
 is it a stressor?

1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:47.660
 Absolutely, it's a stressor if you've got to spend,

1:17:47.660 --> 1:17:50.020
 you know, two hours over, you know,

1:17:50.020 --> 1:17:52.660
 over a four hour period, two hours of it sat in a sauna

1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:53.500
 because you're not sweating.

1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:55.140
 Where the phone doesn't work, so you can't be,

1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:57.040
 no, just, you know, people will divorce them

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.200
 from their phone and that's a stressor in itself.

1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:01.000
 Right, I mean, yes, I think, you know,

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.860
 there's a, you know, what we do is we, like anything,

1:18:04.860 --> 1:18:06.100
 we build up in temperature,

1:18:06.100 --> 1:18:08.300
 but we build up in volume of exposure.

1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:09.960
 So, you know, we start with 15 minutes

1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:13.020
 and then we just try to add on and add on across a time.

1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:17.780
 And now for us, we kind of found about 14 sauna exposures

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:20.100
 starts to really then drive the adaptations

1:18:20.100 --> 1:18:20.920
 that we're looking for.

1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:22.740
 So it's not a quick fix, you know,

1:18:22.740 --> 1:18:25.340
 a heat acclimation strategy has to happen

1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:28.180
 long before fight week or long before the fights.

1:18:28.180 --> 1:18:31.420
 You know, this is a process that has to begin, you know,

1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:32.940
 eight to 10 weeks before the fight

1:18:32.940 --> 1:18:35.160
 so that we can actually get that adaptation

1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:37.100
 and that tolerance to the stressor,

1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:38.620
 to the exposure of heat.

1:18:38.620 --> 1:18:39.540
 This is interesting.

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:41.420
 Until today, when we talked about this earlier

1:18:41.420 --> 1:18:44.740
 and again now, I didn't realize that,

1:18:44.740 --> 1:18:46.900
 but it makes perfect sense now that I hear it,

1:18:46.900 --> 1:18:49.980
 that heat adaptation is possible,

1:18:49.980 --> 1:18:51.460
 that you're basically can train the body

1:18:51.460 --> 1:18:53.480
 to become better at cooling itself,

1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:55.020
 which is what sweating is.

1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:56.740
 I mean, I should have known that before,

1:18:56.740 --> 1:18:58.780
 but you know, you don't see that in the textbooks.

1:18:58.780 --> 1:18:59.620
 And so, yeah.

1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:03.300
 I mean, listen, it's the same

1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:04.860
 as the ketogenic conversation.

1:19:04.860 --> 1:19:06.020
 You know, you're training your body

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:07.800
 to be more metabolic efficient.

1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:10.260
 You're training your body to tolerate heat more.

1:19:10.260 --> 1:19:11.420
 You're training your body.

1:19:11.420 --> 1:19:14.080
 Like the body is, you know, as an organism,

1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:17.580
 as an organic system, it's hugely adaptable.

1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:18.700
 It's hugely plastic.

1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:21.860
 But I think the skill is understanding the whens,

1:19:21.860 --> 1:19:23.460
 the whys, and the where ofs

1:19:23.460 --> 1:19:26.120
 in terms of changing the overload,

1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:29.360
 changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation.

1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:32.460
 And philosophically, that's how we go about our work here.

1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:35.620
 We talk about adaptation-led programming.

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:37.940
 Now, adaptation-led programming

1:19:37.940 --> 1:19:39.740
 fits into every single category,

1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:41.940
 not just lifting weights or running track.

1:19:41.940 --> 1:19:43.280
 It fits into nutrition.

1:19:43.280 --> 1:19:45.220
 It fits into sitting in the sauna.

1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.140
 It fits into being in a cold bath or not.

1:19:47.140 --> 1:19:49.000
 It fits into so many different things

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.940
 because we're driven by scientific insights.

1:19:51.940 --> 1:19:54.460
 And that's how we really want to go about our business.

1:19:54.460 --> 1:19:57.380
 I love it, I love this concept of adaptation-led programming

1:19:57.380 --> 1:19:59.940
 and doing that not just in the context of, you know,

1:19:59.940 --> 1:20:02.220
 throwing another plate on the bar or something like that,

1:20:02.220 --> 1:20:06.660
 but in every aspect of one's training and performance.

1:20:06.660 --> 1:20:07.580
 And I think there's a lot here

1:20:07.580 --> 1:20:10.200
 that's applicable to the recreational athlete too.

1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:11.040
 Yeah.

1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:12.540
 Would you say that, you know,

1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:14.340
 what comes to mind is 12 weeks.

1:20:14.340 --> 1:20:16.780
 It feels like 12 weeks is a nice block of time

1:20:16.780 --> 1:20:18.660
 for someone to try something

1:20:18.660 --> 1:20:20.660
 in terms of to try something new,

1:20:20.660 --> 1:20:22.340
 see how they adapt, adapt,

1:20:22.340 --> 1:20:24.140
 and then maybe switch to something new.

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:25.420
 I realize that it's very hard

1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:29.640
 to throw a kind of pan timeframe around something,

1:20:29.640 --> 1:20:30.900
 but in terms of,

1:20:30.900 --> 1:20:33.420
 if someone wanted to experiment with heat adaptation

1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:35.140
 or experiment with cold adaptation

1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:37.940
 or change up their training regimen or diet

1:20:37.940 --> 1:20:40.420
 and look at metabolic efficiency,

1:20:40.420 --> 1:20:43.600
 do you think 12 weeks is a good period of time

1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:45.460
 to really give something a thorough go

1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:48.360
 and gain an understanding of how well

1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:50.300
 or how poorly something works for oneself?

1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:52.940
 Or would you say eight is enough or three?

1:20:52.940 --> 1:20:55.020
 I mean, that's how long is a piece of string

1:20:55.020 --> 1:20:56.380
 kind of response, right?

1:20:56.380 --> 1:20:57.500
 I mean, yes.

1:20:57.500 --> 1:20:59.700
 If we're just talking arbitrary numbers.

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:01.300
 Recreational experimenter, yeah.

1:21:01.300 --> 1:21:05.060
 Three months exposure, 12 week training strategy,

1:21:05.060 --> 1:21:08.480
 12 week intervention is more than adequate to say,

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:12.060
 for 99% of things that change within the body

1:21:12.060 --> 1:21:14.740
 that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus

1:21:14.740 --> 1:21:15.660
 or an overload stimulus,

1:21:15.660 --> 1:21:19.700
 you're gonna start to see either regression or progression,

1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:21.780
 you know, beneficial or detrimental effects

1:21:21.780 --> 1:21:22.820
 within three months.

1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:24.340
 Absolutely, I would say so.

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.980
 Now, listen, I say that in as much as we do

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:29.860
 training blocks here that are three weeks long.

1:21:29.860 --> 1:21:31.140
 That's because of this constraint

1:21:31.140 --> 1:21:32.900
 that sometimes people suddenly have to,

1:21:32.900 --> 1:21:34.180
 they get the call to fight.

1:21:34.180 --> 1:21:35.020
 Correct, yeah.

1:21:35.020 --> 1:21:36.980
 So it's like super condensed.

1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:39.780
 And, you know, in that scenario,

1:21:39.780 --> 1:21:41.260
 we're always conscious of,

1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:45.520
 is there a body or this individual,

1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:48.660
 do they have the ability to tolerate that super overload,

1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:50.540
 that like super condensed exposure?

1:21:50.540 --> 1:21:52.020
 Now we might be doing that purposefully.

1:21:52.020 --> 1:21:54.180
 We might be trying to do an overreaching strategy

1:21:54.180 --> 1:21:57.380
 where we're really trying to damage or flex something.

1:21:57.380 --> 1:21:59.180
 And I don't mean like negatively damaged,

1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:00.420
 but like we're trying to damage tissue

1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:02.580
 to really get an adaptive response

1:22:02.580 --> 1:22:05.980
 versus, you know, a more drawn out 12 week strategy,

1:22:05.980 --> 1:22:08.760
 which is more coherent, more planned out,

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:10.700
 more structured in nature.

1:22:10.700 --> 1:22:12.980
 But yeah, for all your listeners, I would say,

1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:17.700
 if 12 weeks to engage in a process of, you know,

1:22:17.700 --> 1:22:19.720
 trying to change and adapt your body

1:22:19.720 --> 1:22:22.140
 or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient

1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:24.960
 to see if it's gonna be the right approach for you.

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:26.260
 And I think, you know,

1:22:28.260 --> 1:22:29.940
 the individual interpretation

1:22:29.940 --> 1:22:31.540
 is always has to be considered.

1:22:31.540 --> 1:22:33.420
 And I think that's where it comes back

1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:35.420
 to be a thinking man's athlete

1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:37.780
 or be a thinking man's trainer,

1:22:37.780 --> 1:22:40.620
 like someone that's going through exercise.

1:22:40.620 --> 1:22:43.860
 You have to consciously understand

1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:45.580
 where your body's at any moment in time.

1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:47.000
 You know, you've gotta be real with yourself.

1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.580
 You can create a journal, create a log of your training,

1:22:49.580 --> 1:22:50.700
 create a log of your feelings,

1:22:50.700 --> 1:22:53.140
 your subjective feedback of, you know,

1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:54.780
 how you felt, your mood, your sleep.

1:22:54.780 --> 1:22:55.980
 Your athletes do that.

1:22:55.980 --> 1:22:58.180
 Yeah, yeah, we try to promote that

1:22:58.180 --> 1:23:01.540
 because again, that's part of this process, you know.

1:23:02.500 --> 1:23:03.500
 Might be 12 weeks for you,

1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:06.140
 but I might get the same responses in eight weeks, you know.

1:23:06.140 --> 1:23:10.420
 And I think that's another critical theme here

1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:15.320
 is that, you know, we could put 15 guys on the mat

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:17.540
 and give them the same workout

1:23:17.540 --> 1:23:20.420
 and there's gonna be 15 different responses

1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:21.940
 to that same workout

1:23:21.940 --> 1:23:24.900
 because the human organism is so complex

1:23:24.900 --> 1:23:27.740
 and in nature that it's gonna adapt differently.

1:23:27.740 --> 1:23:29.420
 You know, some people will tolerate it.

1:23:29.420 --> 1:23:31.140
 Some people are gonna be challenged by it.

1:23:31.140 --> 1:23:33.040
 Some people have got a metabolic makeup

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:34.040
 that's gonna promote it.

1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:36.260
 Some people are metabolically challenged by it.

1:23:36.260 --> 1:23:38.860
 You know, there's just so many different things

1:23:38.860 --> 1:23:39.820
 that we have to consider.

1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:41.820
 And that's what we try to do here.

1:23:41.820 --> 1:23:44.360
 It's the cross we bear is that we try to understand

1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:47.980
 on an individual level how to optimize athletic performance.

1:23:47.980 --> 1:23:48.960
 No, I think it's terrific.

1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:50.940
 And you know, the athletes here are so fortunate

1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:53.380
 to have this and most people out there,

1:23:54.220 --> 1:23:56.100
 you know, I've certainly been trying to encourage people

1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.900
 to learn some science and some mechanism

1:23:57.900 --> 1:24:00.060
 and become scientists of their own pursuits,

1:24:00.060 --> 1:24:03.340
 whether or not skill learning or athletic pursuit, et cetera.

1:24:04.340 --> 1:24:07.400
 As a sort of a final question,

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:09.020
 what are some things about the UFC

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:11.700
 or something about the UFC that perhaps people don't know

1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:13.420
 in terms of its overall mission

1:24:13.420 --> 1:24:14.900
 or what you guys are trying to do here?

1:24:14.900 --> 1:24:17.600
 I mean, I think I've become a fan of MMA

1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:20.780
 and I am more and more as time moves on.

1:24:20.780 --> 1:24:22.140
 Some people might be in MMA,

1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:24.500
 some people not into watching MMA,

1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:27.340
 but what are some things that the UFC is interested in

1:24:27.340 --> 1:24:30.860
 and doing that most people might not know about

1:24:30.860 --> 1:24:33.060
 and certainly I might not know about?

1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:36.320
 Yeah, I mean, I think, you know,

1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:39.380
 we try to be cutting edge.

1:24:39.380 --> 1:24:41.260
 We try to be super progressive.

1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:43.940
 You know, we think we've got an amazing platform here,

1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:45.540
 particularly at the Performance Institute

1:24:45.540 --> 1:24:46.720
 to do some really cool things

1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:48.620
 that can inform many different people

1:24:48.620 --> 1:24:51.900
 and that doesn't just mean the 600 or so athletes

1:24:51.900 --> 1:24:53.980
 that are on our global roster.

1:24:53.980 --> 1:24:57.060
 What we're trying to do is influence, you know,

1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.800
 global community around optimizing human performance.

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.600
 So, you know, any moment in time,

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:04.580
 we're engaging in different technologies

1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:06.700
 with different vendors, different partners,

1:25:06.700 --> 1:25:09.180
 you know, exploring opportunities to, you know,

1:25:09.180 --> 1:25:11.820
 learn more, share data, understand what's the best

1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:14.780
 mechanisms for, you know, interpreting your body,

1:25:14.780 --> 1:25:17.020
 interpreting how your body's responding to training,

1:25:17.020 --> 1:25:19.100
 interpreting, you know, your nutrition

1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:19.940
 or whatever it may be.

1:25:19.940 --> 1:25:23.900
 We get, we're in a really privileged position to do that.

1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:26.580
 But we've also, you know, hence you've been here today,

1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:29.040
 you know, we're also trying to venture

1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:31.860
 into some really cool areas of science and research

1:25:31.860 --> 1:25:34.540
 that's got applicability that you can take

1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:36.980
 from high performance athletes and apply, you know,

1:25:36.980 --> 1:25:39.660
 to yourself, to, you know, Joe Blow walking down the street,

1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:42.700
 you know, out there that is really interesting.

1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:45.100
 And that's everything from, you know,

1:25:45.100 --> 1:25:47.100
 whether it's CBD and psychedelics

1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:50.240
 through to different technologies for, you know,

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:53.060
 thermal monitoring and Bluetooth heart rate monitoring

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:56.580
 or whatever it may be through to data management, et cetera,

1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:58.180
 and anything in between.

1:25:58.180 --> 1:26:01.020
 We've got some great partners on the nutrition side,

1:26:01.020 --> 1:26:03.460
 on the psychology side, on the data side.

1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:07.300
 And I think, you know, we always try to just push the envelope

1:26:07.300 --> 1:26:08.140
 a little bit more.

1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:10.680
 I think we keep our core mission with our athletes,

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.380
 but I think a lot of what we do, hence your podcast,

1:26:14.380 --> 1:26:16.400
 and you know, like an amazing platform,

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:17.580
 you do such a great job of it,

1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:21.060
 that, you know, we can all learn and take from, you know,

1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:23.420
 the elite and interpret how it might help us

1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:25.180
 and just in the general population.

1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.540
 So I think that's, you know,

1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:29.560
 that's our North Star is to provide our athletes

1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.540
 the best integrated service of care,

1:26:33.540 --> 1:26:35.140
 but we also want to influence, you know,

1:26:35.140 --> 1:26:37.660
 just the global community and put the UFC

1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:38.700
 at the forefront of that.

1:26:38.700 --> 1:26:40.440
 That's great. Well, you guys are certainly doing it.

1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:43.540
 We can't let the cat out of the bag just yet,

1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:45.580
 but the things that we're gearing up to do

1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:48.700
 with my laboratory and the work together,

1:26:48.700 --> 1:26:50.140
 hopefully we'll be able to talk about that

1:26:50.140 --> 1:26:52.660
 and share that in the year to come,

1:26:52.660 --> 1:26:55.140
 but we're very excited about that.

1:26:55.140 --> 1:27:00.140
 And Duncan, look, you know, I have this filter that I use

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.100
 when I talk to people, academics or otherwise,

1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:04.700
 which is, you know, some people, they open their mouth

1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:06.740
 and it doesn't make much difference,

1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:09.740
 but when you speak, I learn so much.

1:27:09.740 --> 1:27:11.820
 I'm going to take the protocols

1:27:11.820 --> 1:27:13.120
 that I've heard about today.

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.660
 I'm going to think about how I'm training

1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:16.140
 and how I could train differently and better,

1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:19.940
 how I'm eating, how I could eat differently and better

1:27:19.940 --> 1:27:23.320
 for sake of performance and just in general.

1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:26.360
 So thank you so much for your time,

1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:27.720
 your scientific expertise,

1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:30.600
 the stuff you're doing in the practical realm, it's immense.

1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:33.280
 So hopefully we can do it again.

1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:34.240
 Yes. Thank you.

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:35.060
 This has been a blast.

1:27:35.060 --> 1:27:35.900
 I appreciate it.

1:27:35.900 --> 1:27:37.160
 And yeah, keep doing what you're doing

1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:38.640
 because I know there's a lot of people out there

1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:39.560
 that love the platform.

1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:41.000
 So thanks for the invite.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:41.840
 It's been awesome.

1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:43.080
 Thank you. Thanks so much.

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.060
 Thank you for joining me for my conversation

1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:47.800
 with Dr. Duncan French.

1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:51.680
 I hope you found it as insightful and informative as I did.

 That's a terrific way to support this podcast.

1:28:17.460 --> 1:28:18.740
 We also have a Patreon.

1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:21.920
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:23.760
 and there you can support the podcast

1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:25.480
 at any level that you like.

1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:28.320
 Many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:30.700
 we discuss supplements, supplements for sleep,

1:28:30.700 --> 1:28:32.200
 supplements for focus,

1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:34.320
 and for other health benefits as well.

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:36.120
 While supplements may not be for everybody,

1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:37.420
 if you're going to use supplements,

1:28:37.420 --> 1:28:38.860
 you want to make sure that those supplements

1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:40.780
 are of the very highest quality.

1:28:40.780 --> 1:28:44.420
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:28:44.420 --> 1:28:47.880
 because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality

1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.520
 and the amounts of ingredients listed

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:51.960
 on the label of Thorne supplements

1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:54.440
 precisely matches what is actually contained

1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:56.280
 in those capsules, bottles, and pills,

1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:57.600
 and powders, and so forth.

1:28:57.600 --> 1:28:58.740
 This is extremely important.

1:28:58.740 --> 1:29:01.500
 A lot of analysis of supplements and supplement companies

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:04.120
 have shown that what's listed on the bottle

1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:07.480
 is often not what's actually contained in the bottle.

1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:09.360
 Thorne's stringency is unmatched.

1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:11.800
 They've partnered with all the major sports teams,

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:13.200
 with the Mayo Clinic,

1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:15.340
 and so there's a lot of trust in Thorne supplements

1:29:15.340 --> 1:29:16.680
 for all the right reasons.

1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:18.480
 If you'd like to try Thorne supplements,

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.240
 you can see the supplements that I take.

1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:25.240
 You can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:28.000
 There you can see the supplements that I take.

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.240
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements.

1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:32.220
 And if you navigate into the Thorne site

1:29:32.220 --> 1:29:33.440
 through that portal,

1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:37.240
 you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:38.240
 I'd also like to mention

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:39.960
 that if you're not already following us

1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:42.120
 on Instagram at Huberman Lab,

1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:43.920
 you might want to do so there.

1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:47.120
 I do brief science tutorials and offer science-based

1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:50.160
 protocols for all sorts of things that are often separate

1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:51.720
 from the protocols and information

1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:53.780
 covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:29:53.780 --> 1:29:56.560
 We're also on Twitter as Huberman Lab.

1:29:56.560 --> 1:29:59.000
 And last and certainly not least,

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.840
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:15.840
 I'll see you next time.
