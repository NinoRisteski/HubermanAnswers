00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.960
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.960 --> 00:15.080
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.760
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing

00:16.760 --> 00:18.720
 Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.800
 Dr. Sapolsky is a professor of biology and neurosurgery

00:21.800 --> 00:23.680
 at Stanford University.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.980
 His laboratory has worked on a large variety of topics,

00:26.980 --> 00:30.560
 including stress, hormones, including testosterone

00:30.560 --> 00:33.160
 and estrogen, and how the different members

00:33.160 --> 00:35.840
 of a given species interact according to factors

00:35.840 --> 00:39.440
 like hormones, hierarchy within primate troops,

00:39.440 --> 00:42.080
 and how things like stress, reproduction,

00:42.080 --> 00:45.380
 and competition impact behavior.

00:45.380 --> 00:48.480
 One of the things that makes Dr. Sapolsky's work so unique

00:48.480 --> 00:51.000
 is that it combines elements from primatology,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.480
 including field studies, with human behavior,

00:54.480 --> 00:57.640
 in essence, trying to unveil how humans

00:57.640 --> 01:01.280
 as old world primates are controlled by different elements

01:01.280 --> 01:03.880
 of our biology, as well as our psychology.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.840
 Dr. Sapolsky is also a prolific author of popular books,

01:07.840 --> 01:10.080
 such as Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,

01:10.080 --> 01:11.680
 The Trouble with Testosterone,

01:11.680 --> 01:15.440
 and Behave the Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.280
 During the course of our discussion today,

01:17.280 --> 01:19.120
 Robert also revealed to me that he is close

01:19.120 --> 01:21.360
 to completing a new book entitled

01:21.360 --> 01:24.960
 Determined, The Science of Life Without Free Will.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.200
 And indeed, we discuss the science of life

01:27.200 --> 01:29.820
 without free will during this episode.

01:29.820 --> 01:33.340
 We also discuss stress and how best to control stress

01:33.340 --> 01:36.220
 and how stress controls us at both conscious

01:36.220 --> 01:38.060
 and subconscious levels.

01:38.060 --> 01:40.560
 We talk about testosterone and estrogen

01:40.560 --> 01:42.520
 and hormone replacement therapy

01:42.520 --> 01:45.320
 and how those impact our mind, our psychology,

01:45.320 --> 01:47.520
 and our interactions with others.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.700
 As with any discussion with Dr. Sapolsky,

01:49.700 --> 01:51.480
 we learn about scientific mechanisms

01:51.480 --> 01:53.040
 that make us who we are.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.880
 And today we also discuss tools

01:54.880 --> 01:57.300
 and how we can leverage those scientific mechanisms

01:57.300 --> 02:00.360
 in order to be better versions of ourselves.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.520
 I should mention that unlike most guest interviews

02:02.520 --> 02:04.540
 on the Huberman Lab podcast,

02:04.540 --> 02:06.240
 this one had to be carried out remotely

02:06.240 --> 02:07.600
 due to various constraints.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.660
 So you may hear the occasional audio artifact.

02:10.660 --> 02:11.620
 Please excuse that.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.440
 We felt that the value of a conversation

02:13.440 --> 02:18.340
 with Dr. Sapolsky was well worth those minor, minor glitches

02:18.340 --> 02:20.880
 and indeed the information that he delivers us

02:20.880 --> 02:23.600
 is tremendously valuable, interesting,

02:23.600 --> 02:25.840
 and in many cases, actionable as well.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.400
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:28.400 --> 02:31.420
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.580
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

02:33.580 --> 02:36.340
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:36.340 --> 02:39.200
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.320
 In keeping with that theme,

02:40.320 --> 02:43.200
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.200
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.100
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:47.100 --> 02:49.400
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.560
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

02:51.560 --> 02:53.960
 from Stanford and everything about the design

02:53.960 --> 02:55.740
 of the sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:55.740 --> 02:58.380
 was created with performance in mind.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.720
 There are several things I like about Roca glasses so much.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.440
 One of them is that the aesthetic of the glasses is great.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.100
 Unlike a lot of performance glasses out there

03:06.100 --> 03:07.820
 that you can wear while swimming and running,

03:07.820 --> 03:08.920
 but also indoors,

03:08.920 --> 03:10.860
 these glasses don't make you look like a cyborg.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.360
 The aesthetic of them is really terrific

03:12.360 --> 03:14.760
 and they have a lot of different styles to select from.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.720
 In addition to that, the quality of the lenses

03:16.720 --> 03:19.820
 on both the sunglasses and eyeglasses are superb.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.240
 The optical clarity is great.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.720
 You can move from brightly lit areas to shadowed areas

03:23.720 --> 03:25.240
 and you don't get any degradation

03:25.240 --> 03:26.680
 in the quality of the visual image.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.040
 And that's absolutely essential.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.680

03:40.060 --> 03:43.560
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.020
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

03:46.020 --> 03:48.600
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

03:48.600 --> 03:50.440
 to help you better understand your body

03:50.440 --> 03:52.560
 and help you reach your health goals.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.560
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

03:55.560 --> 03:58.000
 and now with the advent of quality DNA tests,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.480
 you can get a lot of information about your genetics

04:00.480 --> 04:02.880
 and how that also impacts your immediate

04:02.880 --> 04:04.280
 and long-term health.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.520
 The reason I'm such a fan of getting blood work done

04:06.520 --> 04:09.000
 is that it is really the only way to understand

04:09.000 --> 04:11.160
 what's going on in your system at a level

04:11.160 --> 04:13.000
 that can really inform your decisions

04:13.000 --> 04:15.600
 about your immediate and long-term health.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.300
 The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however,

04:18.300 --> 04:20.560
 is that you get numbers back about your hormones

04:20.560 --> 04:22.120
 and your metabolic factors, et cetera,

04:22.120 --> 04:24.260
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

04:24.260 --> 04:27.600
 With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy to use dashboard

04:27.600 --> 04:29.000
 that gives you that information

04:29.000 --> 04:31.600
 and then gives you some suggestions and directives

04:31.600 --> 04:33.880
 about things you could change about your nutrition,

04:33.880 --> 04:36.080
 about your exercise and other lifestyle factors

04:36.080 --> 04:38.520
 that can help you move those numbers in the direction

04:38.520 --> 04:40.820
 that's best for you and for your health.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.280
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:42.280 --> 04:45.540
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

04:45.540 --> 04:48.360

04:48.360 --> 04:50.940
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.040
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Belcampo.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.680
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

04:56.680 --> 04:58.600
 that raises organic, grass-fed,

04:58.600 --> 05:01.320
 and finished certified humane meats.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.940
 I eat meat about once a day.

05:02.940 --> 05:07.040
 In general, my lunch or my breakfast consists of some meat

05:07.040 --> 05:08.840
 and that meat has to be a very high quality,

05:08.840 --> 05:10.800
 and generally I'll eat some vegetable as well.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.840
 And then I tend to eat pastas and rice

05:12.840 --> 05:15.420
 and things of that sort later in the day or in the evening

05:15.420 --> 05:17.920
 in order to facilitate the transition to sleep.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.980
 So I'm eating meat about once a day,

05:19.980 --> 05:22.500
 and I always insist that the meat that I eat

05:22.500 --> 05:24.040
 be of the very highest quality

05:24.040 --> 05:27.440
 and that the animals were raised and maintained humanely.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.040
 While conventionally raised animals are confined to feed lots

05:30.040 --> 05:32.120
 and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

05:32.120 --> 05:34.480
 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

05:34.480 --> 05:36.480
 and seasonal grasses, resulting in meat

05:36.480 --> 05:39.200
 that's higher in nutrients and healthy fats.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.960
 In addition, they raise their animals in a way

05:40.960 --> 05:42.760
 that's not just better for our health,

05:42.760 --> 05:45.520
 but also has a positive impact on the environment.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.180
 They practice regenerative agriculture,

05:47.180 --> 05:49.280
 which means the meat is climate positive

05:49.280 --> 05:50.520
 and carbon negative.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.060
 So you can feel good about what you're eating

05:52.060 --> 05:55.140
 at the environmental level and for sake of your health.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.320
 You can order Belcampo's sustainably raised meats

05:57.320 --> 05:59.800
 to be delivered to you by using my code Huberman

05:59.800 --> 06:02.280
 at belcampo.com slash Huberman

06:02.280 --> 06:03.720
 and entering my code Huberman

06:03.720 --> 06:06.940
 to get 20% off your first time order.

06:06.940 --> 06:09.820
 I'm partial to the ribeyes or the New York steaks.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.240
 So on one day I might have a ribeye,

06:11.240 --> 06:12.720
 the next day I might have a New York steak.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.440
 I also really like the meatballs.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.340
 I'm a particular fan of the meatballs.

06:16.340 --> 06:19.680
 So again, that's belcampo.com slash Huberman

06:19.680 --> 06:21.960
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout

06:21.960 --> 06:24.080
 to get 20% off your order.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.280
 And now without further ado,

06:26.280 --> 06:29.380
 my conversation with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.960
 Great, well, thank you so much, Robert,

06:30.960 --> 06:33.000
 for joining us today.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
 I've been looking forward to this for a very long time.

06:36.000 --> 06:36.840
 I appreciate it.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.500
 I'm glad to be here.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.200
 There's an enormous range of topics

06:42.200 --> 06:44.360
 that we could drill into,

06:44.360 --> 06:46.960
 but just to start off,

06:46.960 --> 06:50.120
 I want to return to a topic that is near and dear

06:50.120 --> 06:52.360
 to your heart, which is stress.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.840
 And one of the questions that I get most commonly

06:55.840 --> 07:00.680
 is what is the difference between short and long-term stress

07:00.680 --> 07:05.160
 in terms of their benefits and their drawbacks?

07:05.160 --> 07:08.720
 And the reason I say benefits is that obviously stress

07:08.720 --> 07:10.640
 and the stress response can keep us alive,

07:10.640 --> 07:14.460
 but stress of course can also sharpen our mental acuity

07:14.460 --> 07:15.800
 and things of that sort.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.600
 So how should we conceptualize stress

07:19.600 --> 07:22.040
 and how should we conceptualize stress

07:22.040 --> 07:24.520
 in the short term and in the long term?

07:24.520 --> 07:29.520
 Well, basically sort of two graphs that one would draw.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.480
 The first one is just all sorts

07:33.480 --> 07:36.960
 of beneficial effects of stress short term.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.640
 And then once we get into the chronicity,

07:39.640 --> 07:41.540
 it's just downhill from there.

07:41.540 --> 07:45.120
 Short term because it saves you from the predator.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.960
 Short term because you're giving a presentation

07:47.960 --> 07:49.920
 and you think more clearly,

07:49.920 --> 07:53.920
 or your focus is better, all sorts of aspects of that.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.540
 And what then winds up being an argument

07:57.540 --> 08:02.360
 is how long does it take to go from short term to long term?

08:02.360 --> 08:05.240
 And that's somewhat arbitrary,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.980
 but the sorts of chronic stressors

08:07.980 --> 08:11.820
 that most people deal with are just undeniably

08:11.820 --> 08:13.200
 in the chronic range,

08:13.200 --> 08:16.760
 like having spent the last 20 years, daily traffic jams

08:16.760 --> 08:20.160
 or abusive boss or some such thing.

08:21.140 --> 08:24.640
 The other curve that's sort of perpendicular to this

08:24.640 --> 08:26.760
 is dealing with the fact

08:26.760 --> 08:30.400
 that sometimes stress is a great thing.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.880
 Like our goal is not to cure people of stress

08:34.880 --> 08:36.960
 because if it's the right kind, we love it.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.480
 We pay good money to be stressed that way

08:40.480 --> 08:44.000
 by a scary movie or roller coaster ride.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.920
 What you wind up seeing is

08:45.920 --> 08:48.320
 when it's the right amount of stress,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.640
 it's what we call stimulation.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.320
 And the basic curve there is here's an optimal level

08:54.320 --> 08:58.200
 of stimulation and too little and function goes down

08:58.200 --> 09:01.120
 with what we would call boredom and too much

09:01.120 --> 09:04.080
 and function goes down with what we would call stress.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.900
 And the optimum is what all of us aim for.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.820
 In terms of the benefits of stress in the short term,

09:14.880 --> 09:17.840
 one thing that's really striking to me is

09:17.840 --> 09:22.320
 how physiologically the stress response

09:22.320 --> 09:25.120
 looks so much like the excitement response

09:25.120 --> 09:27.400
 to a positive event.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.440
 And we can speculate that the fundamental difference

09:31.440 --> 09:35.220
 between short-term stress and short-term excitement

09:35.220 --> 09:37.700
 is some neuromodulator like dopamine

09:37.700 --> 09:38.940
 or something like that.

09:38.940 --> 09:42.360
 But is there anything else that we know about the biology

09:42.360 --> 09:46.360
 that reveals to us what really creates this thing

09:46.360 --> 09:50.580
 we call valence that an experience can be terrible

09:50.580 --> 09:54.720
 or feel awful, or it can feel wonderful, exhilarating

09:54.720 --> 09:58.320
 depending on this somewhat subjective feature

09:58.320 --> 10:00.040
 we call valence.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.180
 Do we know what valence is or where it resides?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.220
 On a really mechanical level,

10:08.240 --> 10:11.680
 if you're in a circumstance that is requiring

10:11.680 --> 10:16.000
 that your heart races and you're breathing as fast

10:16.000 --> 10:19.620
 and you're using your muscles and some such thing,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.720
 you're going to be having roughly

10:21.720 --> 10:24.780
 the same brain activation profile,

10:24.780 --> 10:26.440
 whether this is for something wonderful

10:26.440 --> 10:29.480
 or something terrible with the one exception being

10:29.480 --> 10:33.480
 that if the amygdala is part of the activation,

10:33.480 --> 10:36.280
 this is something that's going to be counting as adverse.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.440
 Whether that's the circumstance, an adverse circumstance

10:41.440 --> 10:43.720
 recruiting the amygdala into it

10:43.720 --> 10:46.680
 and how much it's the amygdala being involved

10:46.680 --> 10:50.820
 biases you towards interpreting it as even more awful.

10:50.820 --> 10:54.160
 The amygdala in some ways is kind of the checkpoint

10:54.160 --> 10:58.420
 as to whether we're talking about excitement or terror.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.140
 Let's use the amygdala as a transition point

11:02.140 --> 11:06.500
 to another topic that you've spent many years working on

11:06.500 --> 11:09.780
 and thinking about, which is testosterone

11:09.780 --> 11:12.260
 and other sex steroid hormones.

11:12.260 --> 11:14.620
 I heard you say once before that

11:16.620 --> 11:19.980
 among all the brain areas that bind testosterone,

11:19.980 --> 11:23.220
 that where testosterone can park and create effects

11:23.220 --> 11:28.220
 that the amygdala is among the most chock-a-block full

11:28.940 --> 11:32.060
 of these parking spots, these receptors.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.180
 I realize there's a lot here,

11:34.180 --> 11:37.700
 but how should we think about the role of testosterone

11:37.700 --> 11:41.240
 in the amygdala given that the engagement of the amygdala

11:41.240 --> 11:43.420
 is fundamental in this transition point

11:43.420 --> 11:46.260
 between a exhilarating positive response

11:46.260 --> 11:50.020
 and a negative stressful response?

11:50.020 --> 11:51.500
 Or maybe just broadly,

11:51.500 --> 11:53.240
 how should we think about testosterone

11:53.240 --> 11:54.740
 and its effects on the brain?

11:55.920 --> 11:58.260
 And pertinent to the transition

11:58.260 --> 12:02.220
 from whether this is a stressor that's evoking fear

12:02.220 --> 12:06.380
 or evoking aggression in terms of that continuum also

12:06.380 --> 12:08.460
 because the amygdala is in the center

12:08.460 --> 12:11.460
 of all four points on those axes.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.540
 Basically almost everybody out there

12:15.540 --> 12:19.140
 has a completely wrong idea as to what testosterone does,

12:19.140 --> 12:21.900
 which is testosterone makes you aggressive

12:21.900 --> 12:24.780
 because males, virtually every species out there

12:24.780 --> 12:27.280
 have more testosterone and are more aggressive

12:27.280 --> 12:30.380
 and seasonal maters have testosterone

12:30.380 --> 12:32.020
 surging at the time of year.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.260
 They're punching it out over territory

12:34.260 --> 12:39.200
 and you take testosterone out of the picture.

12:39.200 --> 12:43.060
 You castrate any mammal out there, including us,

12:43.060 --> 12:45.860
 and levels of aggression will go down.

12:45.860 --> 12:48.740
 And the easy thing then is to conclude

12:48.740 --> 12:51.900
 that testosterone causes aggression.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.300
 And the reality is testosterone does no such thing.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.180
 It doesn't cause aggression.

12:57.180 --> 13:00.640
 And you can see this both behaviorally and in the amygdala.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.940
 What does testosterone do?

13:02.940 --> 13:06.440
 It lowers the threshold for the sort of things

13:06.440 --> 13:09.620
 that would normally provoke you into being aggressive

13:09.620 --> 13:12.040
 so that it happens more easily.

13:12.040 --> 13:16.220
 It makes systems that are already turned on

13:16.220 --> 13:20.580
 turn on louder rather than turning on aggressive music

13:20.580 --> 13:21.620
 or some such thing.

13:21.620 --> 13:24.240
 What does that look like behaviorally?

13:24.240 --> 13:27.480
 You take five male monkeys, put them together,

13:27.480 --> 13:30.060
 they form a dominance hierarchy.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.700
 Number one is great, number five is miserable,

13:32.700 --> 13:34.220
 number three is right in between.

13:34.220 --> 13:37.340
 Now take number three and shoot the guy up

13:37.340 --> 13:39.920
 with tons of testosterone

13:39.920 --> 13:43.020
 and he's gonna be involved in more fights.

13:43.020 --> 13:46.740
 Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression.

13:46.740 --> 13:49.660
 But you look closely and there's a pattern to it.

13:49.660 --> 13:54.260
 Is number three now challenging numbers two and one

13:54.260 --> 13:55.780
 for their place in the hierarchy?

13:55.780 --> 13:56.820
 Absolutely not.

13:56.820 --> 14:00.540
 He is brown nosing them exactly as much as he used to.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.700
 What's going on is he's just a miserable terror

14:03.700 --> 14:06.220
 to poor number four and five.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.760
 And in that case, what testosterone is doing

14:08.760 --> 14:13.560
 is amplifying the preexisting patterns of aggression,

14:13.560 --> 14:17.900
 amplifying the social learning that's already gone into it.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.780
 Now on sort of the more reductive level,

14:20.780 --> 14:23.440
 so how does that translate into the amygdala?

14:23.440 --> 14:26.840
 Does testosterone make amigdolloid neurons

14:26.840 --> 14:28.900
 have action potentials?

14:28.900 --> 14:32.300
 Does it cause those neurons to suddenly speak

14:32.300 --> 14:35.040
 about fear and aggression spontaneously?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.540
 Absolutely not.

14:36.540 --> 14:41.540
 What they do is if the amygdala is already being stimulated,

14:41.960 --> 14:44.420
 it increases the rate of neuronal firing.

14:45.300 --> 14:49.620
 What it's worth, it shortens after hyperpolarizations.

14:49.620 --> 14:53.260
 So the theme there exactly is it's not creating aggression,

14:53.260 --> 14:54.900
 it's just upping the volume

14:54.900 --> 14:57.660
 of whatever aggression is already there.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.860
 And once you factor that in,

15:01.120 --> 15:04.940
 it's impossible to say anything about what testosterone does

15:04.940 --> 15:09.940
 outside the context of what testosterone-related behaviors,

15:10.300 --> 15:14.220
 how they get treated in your social settings.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.840
 Yeah, and in terms of status

15:17.840 --> 15:19.840
 and the relationship between individuals,

15:19.840 --> 15:23.120
 either non-human primates or humans,

15:23.120 --> 15:26.820
 can we say that testosterone and levels of testosterone,

15:26.820 --> 15:29.420
 or I should say, can we say that relative levels

15:29.420 --> 15:31.620
 of testosterone between individuals

15:31.620 --> 15:34.980
 is correlated to status within the hierarchy?

15:36.660 --> 15:38.600
 Yes, but in a way that winds up

15:38.600 --> 15:41.020
 being totally uninteresting.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.480
 Like you go back, I don't know,

15:42.480 --> 15:45.620
 whatever number of decades to endocrinology texts,

15:45.620 --> 15:49.540
 and there were two totally reliable findings in there.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.740
 Let's see, I have a dog in here that's so good.

15:51.740 --> 15:54.140
 We like dogs at the Huberman Lab podcast.

15:55.140 --> 15:57.460
 He's jingling a bit.

15:57.460 --> 15:58.340
 They are welcome.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.180
 They are absolutely welcome, yeah.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.900
 And there'd be two truisms,

16:02.900 --> 16:06.220
 which is higher levels of testosterone

16:06.220 --> 16:08.680
 predict higher levels of aggression

16:08.680 --> 16:10.300
 in humans and other animals.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.460
 Higher levels of testosterone

16:12.460 --> 16:15.580
 predict higher levels of sexual activity.

16:15.580 --> 16:18.420
 Whoa, testosterone causing both.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.340
 And the correlation is there.

16:20.340 --> 16:23.780
 And when you look closely, we've got cause and effect stuff.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.380
 Sexual behavior raises testosterone levels.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.400
 Aggression raises testosterone levels.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.300
 Your levels beforehand are barely predictive

16:33.300 --> 16:34.820
 of what's going to happen.

16:34.820 --> 16:37.140
 So it's a response rather than a cause.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.840
 When you look at that, though,

16:39.840 --> 16:42.820
 in terms of making sense of individual differences,

16:43.700 --> 16:45.720
 they don't matter a whole lot.

16:46.840 --> 16:51.840
 You can spend an entire career on the social circumstances

16:51.840 --> 16:56.840
 that produce 3.5% more testosterone in the circulation

16:57.700 --> 17:02.000
 and expect to see all sorts of interesting implications.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.240
 And that's not really the case.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.000
 It's somewhat of a yes or no modulator

17:08.000 --> 17:12.200
 of the much more subtle social stuff that's already there.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.600
 Very interesting.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.680
 You know, I think that there are a lot of misconceptions

17:17.680 --> 17:18.760
 about human biology,

17:18.760 --> 17:21.360
 but testosterone seems to be one area

17:21.360 --> 17:24.420
 where at least from what I can find on the internet,

17:24.420 --> 17:28.960
 there's a sort of at the peak of misunderstanding.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.520
 Maybe we could just ask a few more questions

17:30.520 --> 17:32.320
 about testosterone and sexual behavior,

17:32.320 --> 17:34.720
 because there's an interesting story there

17:34.720 --> 17:38.000
 about castration versus non-castration

17:38.000 --> 17:40.260
 and the causality again.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.360
 But before you address that,

17:42.360 --> 17:44.160
 I just want to highlight something that you said

17:44.160 --> 17:46.160
 that I think is so vital,

17:46.160 --> 17:49.260
 which is that behaviors such as aggressive behaviors

17:49.260 --> 17:52.240
 and sexual behaviors can actually increase testosterone.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.800
 Did I hear that correctly?

17:53.800 --> 17:56.640
 And the reverse is sort of true,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.360
 but not in a causal way.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.460
 Is that right?

18:01.320 --> 18:04.280
 The opposite direction with the causality, yeah.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.040
 Yeah, so if I were to increase somebody's testosterone

18:07.040 --> 18:10.200
 by 30% male or female, doesn't matter,

18:10.200 --> 18:12.760
 their sexual behavior may or may not change.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.240
 Essentially zero effect at all.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.600
 Your brain is not that sensitive to fluctuations

18:18.600 --> 18:20.360
 in testosterone levels.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.120
 In terms of things like aggression,

18:22.120 --> 18:25.280
 raising testosterone just is a great footnote.

18:25.280 --> 18:29.200
 If you have the right type of willing to die

18:29.200 --> 18:31.680
 in the trenches devotion sort of thing,

18:31.680 --> 18:34.720
 watching your favorite team play a sport

18:34.720 --> 18:37.000
 will raise your testosterone levels

18:37.000 --> 18:39.920
 as you sit there with a potato chips in your arm chair.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.520
 So it's not the physicality of aggression,

18:43.520 --> 18:47.780
 it's the psychological framing of it.

18:47.780 --> 18:51.440
 So yeah, testosterone is not causing that.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.840
 And a great way to appreciate that is,

18:54.840 --> 18:57.560
 okay, so you had all these

18:57.560 --> 19:00.360
 testosterone sexual behavior correlations

19:00.360 --> 19:04.760
 and you do the definitive endocrine intervention,

19:04.760 --> 19:07.960
 which is you do a subtraction study,

19:07.960 --> 19:09.600
 you've removed the testes.

19:09.600 --> 19:14.280
 And as I said before, levels of sexual behavior goes down.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.360
 Good, we've just shown that testosterone

19:16.360 --> 19:18.200
 is somehow causative.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.440
 Critically, they go down, but not down to zero,

19:22.440 --> 19:27.440
 whether you are a rat or a monkey or a human, whatever.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.880
 And what predicts how much residual sexual behavior is there,

19:31.880 --> 19:35.640
 how much sexual behavior there was before castration.

19:36.540 --> 19:39.640
 What that's telling you is by then,

19:39.640 --> 19:43.060
 that's behavior that's being carried by social learning

19:43.060 --> 19:47.080
 in context, rather than by a hormone, exact same thing

19:47.080 --> 19:51.120
 with aggression, drops after castration, doesn't go to zero.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.280
 The more prior history of it,

19:53.280 --> 19:55.740
 the more it just keeps coasting along on its own,

19:55.740 --> 19:57.880
 even without testosterone.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.440
 Very interesting, can we say that there's an exception

20:01.440 --> 20:04.560
 in terms of the early organizing effects of hormones?

20:04.560 --> 20:07.040
 Like for instance, if a developing animal is deprived

20:07.040 --> 20:11.500
 of testosterone or estrogen or aromatized testosterone

20:11.500 --> 20:13.840
 into estrogen, there's a whole story there, as you know.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.160
 But then I could imagine that the circuits of the brain

20:17.160 --> 20:19.500
 that are responsible for initiating sexual behavior

20:19.500 --> 20:21.240
 in the first place might not emerge

20:21.240 --> 20:24.560
 and therefore not be sensitive to testosterone later in life.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.400
 Is that right?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.220
 Okay.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.060
 Yeah, exactly.

20:27.060 --> 20:31.080
 And a great way of seeing that is this totally nutty

20:31.080 --> 20:34.640
 biological factoid, which is the second

20:34.640 --> 20:37.840
 to fourth digit ratio in hands.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.680
 Oh yeah.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.040
 Totally obscure thing.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.920
 The ratio of one to the other in some way

20:43.920 --> 20:47.360
 reflects levels of testosterone androgen exposure

20:47.360 --> 20:48.840
 during fetal life.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.440
 And I can't remember which way it goes

20:50.440 --> 20:53.600
 and it's minuscule and you need a thousand people

20:53.600 --> 20:56.120
 in your sample size to be able to see anything,

20:56.120 --> 20:58.840
 but you see it in other primates.

20:58.840 --> 21:03.020
 It's already there in fetal, sonograms, all of that.

21:03.020 --> 21:07.760
 So that's a readout of subtle differences

21:07.760 --> 21:10.200
 in prenatal exposure.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.960
 And that winds up being a predictor

21:11.960 --> 21:16.760
 of a whole range of subtle stuff in adult behavior.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.120
 So yeah, at the fetal end,

21:18.120 --> 21:19.800
 when you're still building everything,

21:19.800 --> 21:21.560
 testosterone and the amount of it

21:21.560 --> 21:23.240
 is making a huge difference.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.080
 By the time you're an adult,

21:25.080 --> 21:29.320
 it's just somewhat of an all or none signal.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.160
 Yeah.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.280
 I have a confession,

21:31.280 --> 21:33.400
 which is that I was a master's student at Berkeley

21:33.400 --> 21:35.660
 in Mark Breedlove's arena.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.400
 So I'm an author on that paper,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.280
 although I'm deep within the author line

21:40.280 --> 21:43.020
 and you got the description of it exactly right,

21:43.020 --> 21:44.040
 that it's the D two,

21:44.040 --> 21:46.560
 the index finger to the ring finger ratio

21:46.560 --> 21:48.940
 is more similar in females

21:48.940 --> 21:50.560
 and then it is in males and males,

21:50.560 --> 21:52.160
 the index finger tends to be shorter.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.840
 And for people out there who are listening to this,

21:53.840 --> 21:57.720
 who are now freaking out or measuring,

21:57.720 --> 21:59.420
 there's a proper way to measure this,

21:59.420 --> 22:03.360
 which is eyeballing it doesn't work all the time

22:03.360 --> 22:04.540
 unless at the extremes.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.440
 And there's some more interesting stories there.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.040
 It actually has been replicated

22:08.040 --> 22:12.180
 no fewer than five times, Mark Breedlove tells me.

22:13.320 --> 22:17.320
 But yes, in terms of these early organizing effects,

22:17.320 --> 22:20.720
 those seem very robust in most studies.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.520
 These later effects are a sort of activation

22:23.520 --> 22:25.080
 of neural circuits by hormones.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.300
 I'm absolutely fascinated by this.

22:27.300 --> 22:30.160
 And I do have a couple other questions,

22:30.160 --> 22:33.680
 which is we normally associate testosterone with males,

22:33.680 --> 22:36.600
 but of course, females make testosterone as well

22:36.600 --> 22:39.160
 from the adrenals and presumably elsewhere too.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.540
 I'm guessing if we looked hard enough,

22:40.540 --> 22:42.120
 we'd probably find that there were other sources

22:42.120 --> 22:45.040
 of androgens in females.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.920
 Can we say that these general contours of effects

22:48.920 --> 22:53.540
 on aggression also pertain to females?

22:53.540 --> 22:57.080
 And I suppose I should ask in particular

22:57.080 --> 22:59.540
 about female-female aggression,

22:59.540 --> 23:01.240
 which does exist in many species,

23:01.240 --> 23:04.180
 female-male to aggression, as well as maternal aggression,

23:04.180 --> 23:08.400
 which is a robust aspect of our evolution, of course,

23:08.400 --> 23:13.160
 that the mother will, an angry mother animal of any kind

23:13.160 --> 23:16.540
 protecting her young is truly dangerous

23:16.540 --> 23:19.100
 in the best sense of the word.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.880
 And that type of post-parturition period

23:22.880 --> 23:27.760
 after birth aggression is all about estrogen,

23:27.760 --> 23:29.760
 progesterone, those sorts of things.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.760
 Female aggression the rest of the time

23:31.760 --> 23:34.660
 has testosterone as a major player

23:34.660 --> 23:37.600
 at a much lower level on the average,

23:37.600 --> 23:40.400
 on the average, one always has to say,

23:40.400 --> 23:42.740
 but it's basically the same punchlines.

23:42.740 --> 23:45.880
 In females, the lower levels of testosterone

23:45.880 --> 23:49.440
 are essential for typical levels of aggression

23:49.440 --> 23:51.080
 and sexual behavior.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.000
 None of us, they're not causing it.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.920
 It's not sensitive to small individual differences.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.280
 Same exact thing.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.800
 You can get way over impressed

23:59.800 --> 24:02.720
 with the importance of androgens in females

24:02.720 --> 24:05.120
 just as readily as in males.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.800
 So in line with that,

24:06.800 --> 24:10.300
 how should we conceptualize testosterone?

24:10.300 --> 24:11.920
 I realize there isn't a single sentence

24:11.920 --> 24:16.320
 or that can capture a hormone and all its effects

24:16.320 --> 24:18.180
 because hormones have so many different slow

24:18.180 --> 24:20.320
 and fast effects on the brain, on other glands,

24:20.320 --> 24:23.340
 on their own, on the very glands that produce them.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.960
 But as I've heard you talk about testosterone today

24:25.960 --> 24:28.320
 and over the years, I start to get the impression

24:28.320 --> 24:31.920
 that as the most misunderstood molecule

24:31.920 --> 24:34.080
 in human health in the universe,

24:34.080 --> 24:38.000
 it has, it's clearly doing something very powerful.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.560
 It's shifting the way that certain neural circuits work,

24:40.560 --> 24:42.800
 adjusting the gain on the amygdala as you described

24:42.800 --> 24:45.360
 and certainly other things as well.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.560
 Is there any truism about testosterone

24:49.560 --> 24:51.440
 and its relationship to effort

24:51.440 --> 24:55.280
 or its relationship to resilience

24:55.280 --> 24:59.400
 and in a way that maybe will help me and other people

24:59.400 --> 25:03.120
 sort of think about how to think about testosterone?

25:03.120 --> 25:08.040
 Yeah, maybe three separate answers to that.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.640
 The first one is I think it's a fair summary

25:11.640 --> 25:16.640
 to think that when it comes to motivated strong behaviors,

25:17.100 --> 25:19.400
 what testosterone does is make you more

25:19.400 --> 25:21.840
 of whatever you already are in that domain.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.840
 Sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,

25:25.840 --> 25:28.880
 spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression,

25:28.880 --> 25:30.040
 things of that sort.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.600
 It's upping the volume of things

25:31.600 --> 25:33.240
 that are already strongly there.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.200
 Second way to think about it is,

25:39.560 --> 25:44.120
 well, here's like my favorite finding about testosterone.

25:44.120 --> 25:48.640
 And this was some wonderful work by a guy, John Wingfield,

25:48.640 --> 25:51.040
 who's one of the best behavioral endocrinologists

25:51.040 --> 25:54.920
 out there, and about 20 years ago,

25:54.920 --> 25:59.480
 he formulated what was called the challenge hypothesis

25:59.480 --> 26:01.600
 of testosterone action.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.760
 What does testosterone do?

26:03.760 --> 26:06.320
 Testosterone is what you secrete

26:06.320 --> 26:08.980
 when your status is being challenged

26:08.980 --> 26:11.760
 and it makes it more likely that you'll do the behaviors

26:11.760 --> 26:14.280
 needed to hold onto your status.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.960
 Okay, so that's totally boringly straightforward

26:16.960 --> 26:18.200
 if you're a baboon.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.020
 If somebody is challenging your high rank,

26:21.020 --> 26:22.720
 the appropriate response on your part

26:22.720 --> 26:24.440
 is going to be aggression.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.760
 All right, so we've just gotten through the back door

26:26.760 --> 26:28.800
 of testosterone and aggression again.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.680
 But then you get to humans,

26:31.680 --> 26:33.720
 and humans have lots of different ways

26:33.720 --> 26:36.320
 of achieving or maintaining status.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.640
 And all you need to do is go to like some fancy

26:39.640 --> 26:42.720
 private school's annual auction,

26:42.720 --> 26:46.320
 and you will see all these half-drunk alpha males

26:46.320 --> 26:50.720
 competing to see who can give the most money away

26:50.720 --> 26:54.120
 as a show of conspicuous like, you know,

26:55.080 --> 26:56.480
 property that they have.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.800
 And in a setting like that, I mean,

26:58.800 --> 27:01.680
 I haven't been able to take urine samples

27:01.680 --> 27:03.300
 at those times, unfortunately,

27:03.300 --> 27:05.880
 but that shows the flip side of it.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.680
 If you have a species that hands out status

27:08.680 --> 27:10.960
 in a very different sort of way,

27:10.960 --> 27:12.720
 testosterone is going to boost that also.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.960
 Okay, so that generates a totally nutty prediction.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.760
 Wow, take people in a circumstance,

27:18.760 --> 27:20.960
 say playing an economic game,

27:20.960 --> 27:24.600
 where you get status by being trustworthy

27:24.600 --> 27:27.680
 and being generous in your interactions with the game.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.840
 If you give people testosterone,

27:29.840 --> 27:32.240
 does that make them more generous?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
 And that's absolutely the case.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.980
 Totally cool finding.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.600
 Showing you, I don't know,

27:38.600 --> 27:41.960
 basically if you took a whole bunch of Buddhist monks

27:41.960 --> 27:44.240
 and shot them up with testosterone,

27:44.240 --> 27:46.120
 they'd get all competitive with each other

27:46.120 --> 27:49.440
 as to who could do the most random acts of kindness.

27:49.440 --> 27:54.440
 And if we have a societal problem with too much aggression,

27:54.480 --> 27:57.440
 the first culprit to look at is not testosterone.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.120
 The first to look at is that we hand out

28:00.120 --> 28:03.480
 so much damn elevated status for aggression

28:03.480 --> 28:06.000
 in so many circumstances.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.600
 So I find that finding to be fantastic.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.960
 Third thing about subtlety of testosterone.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.240
 Okay, so like some subtler behavioral effects,

28:15.240 --> 28:17.320
 you give testosterone to people

28:17.320 --> 28:19.840
 and they become more confident.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.400
 They become more self-confident.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.440
 Well, that's good.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.620
 People pay to take all sorts of nonsensical self-help courses

28:27.620 --> 28:29.920
 that will boost your self-esteem.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.680
 And that's a good thing.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.640
 Unless testosterone makes you more confident,

28:35.640 --> 28:37.440
 that is inaccurate.

28:37.440 --> 28:41.040
 And you're more likely to barrel into wrong decisions.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.040
 What's shown in economic gameplay

28:44.040 --> 28:47.040
 is that testosterone by making you more confident

28:47.040 --> 28:48.960
 makes you less cooperative.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.360
 Because who needs to cooperate

28:50.360 --> 28:52.580
 because I'm on top of this all on my own.

28:53.460 --> 28:57.640
 Testosterone makes people cocky and impulsive.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.920
 And that may be great in one setting,

28:59.920 --> 29:02.240
 but if in the other is you're absolutely sure

29:02.240 --> 29:05.680
 your army is gonna overrun the other country in three days.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.600
 So hell, let's start World War I

29:07.600 --> 29:09.800
 and you get a big surprise out of it.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.640
 Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand

29:13.640 --> 29:17.720
 probably played a big role in that kind of miscalculation.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.080
 Super interesting.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.480
 I always think about testosterone and dopamine

29:21.480 --> 29:23.680
 being close cousins in the brain,

29:23.680 --> 29:25.680
 not just because of their relationship

29:25.680 --> 29:28.760
 through the pituitary and hypothalamus, that of course,

29:28.760 --> 29:32.920
 but also because of dopamine's salient role

29:32.920 --> 29:37.240
 in creating this bias towards exteroception.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.840
 When somebody takes a drug that increases dopamine

29:40.840 --> 29:43.280
 or they're chock-a-block full of dopamine,

29:43.280 --> 29:45.680
 they tend, I want to highlight tend

29:45.680 --> 29:47.020
 because I'm really generalizing it,

29:47.020 --> 29:49.920
 but they tend to focus on outward goals,

29:49.920 --> 29:52.740
 things beyond the boundaries of their skin.

29:52.740 --> 29:56.200
 And testosterone seems to do a bit of the same.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.200
 It tends to put us into a similar mode

29:58.200 --> 30:01.120
 of perceiving the outside world

30:01.120 --> 30:04.760
 in ways that we're asking questions like,

30:04.760 --> 30:07.800
 how do I relate to this other of my species?

30:07.800 --> 30:09.740
 How do I relate to these goals?

30:09.740 --> 30:12.600
 Is there anything that we can do

30:12.600 --> 30:14.560
 to better conceptualize the relationship

30:14.560 --> 30:17.680
 between testosterone and dopamine and motivation?

30:17.680 --> 30:20.840
 Or would that just take us down the alleyways

30:20.840 --> 30:23.240
 of neural pathways and the hypothalamus,

30:23.240 --> 30:24.800
 which was fine too.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.300
 Well, I think it's got lots to do

30:27.300 --> 30:30.960
 with sort of this massive revisionism about dopamine.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.920
 Everyone since the pharaohs got brought up

30:33.920 --> 30:37.480
 being taught that dopamine is about pleasure and reward.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.480
 It turns out it isn't.

30:38.480 --> 30:41.560
 It's about anticipation of reward.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.080
 And it's about generating the motivation,

30:44.080 --> 30:48.040
 the goal-directed behavior needed to go get that reward.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.060
 And before you know it,

30:49.060 --> 30:53.080
 you're using like elevated dopamine your entire life

30:53.080 --> 30:55.760
 to motivate you to do whatever's going to get you

30:55.760 --> 30:58.240
 like entry into heaven after life.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.940
 Kind of, you know, it's doing that sort of thing.

31:01.940 --> 31:04.600
 So it's really about the motivation.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.520
 And what testosterone does,

31:06.520 --> 31:09.160
 even in individuals who are not aggressive

31:09.160 --> 31:11.360
 and why testosterone replacement

31:11.360 --> 31:14.600
 is often a very helpful thing for aging males,

31:14.600 --> 31:16.720
 is it increases energy.

31:16.720 --> 31:21.120
 It increases a sense of there-ness,

31:21.120 --> 31:22.680
 of presence of alertness.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.360
 It increases motivation.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.460
 So that's a whole aspect which then takes us into

31:28.460 --> 31:33.120
 is your motivation to get up and like go,

31:33.120 --> 31:35.040
 you know, hand out lots of soup

31:35.040 --> 31:37.300
 in a soup kitchen for homeless people?

31:37.300 --> 31:41.120
 Or is it to get up and go ethnically cleanse a village?

31:42.200 --> 31:45.080
 It's got much to do with what your makeup was

31:45.080 --> 31:47.520
 before the testosterone got on board.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.680
 So it's activating in an energetic sense,

31:50.680 --> 31:53.160
 testosterone within minutes

31:53.160 --> 31:56.720
 increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle.

31:56.720 --> 32:00.440
 You're just more awake and alert and all of that.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.120
 And that has a lot to do with what dopamine does.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.280
 And as one might predict then,

32:05.280 --> 32:09.320
 getting just the right levels of testosterone

32:09.320 --> 32:13.760
 infused into your bloodstream feels great to lab rats.

32:13.760 --> 32:17.920
 They will lever press to get infused into the range

32:17.920 --> 32:19.960
 that optimizes dopamine release.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.720
 So you're absolutely right.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.480
 They're deeply intertwined.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.760
 Yeah, such beautiful biology there.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.280
 I love the way you encapsulate their relationship.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.360
 I want to ask about estrogen.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.340
 We don't hear about estrogen as often.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.480
 And it's always interesting to me now

32:38.480 --> 32:41.080
 doing some public facing education, you know,

32:41.080 --> 32:44.600
 that testosterone is this very controversial molecule.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.280
 Just to say it is almost controversial.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.400
 But estrogen doesn't seem to hold

32:50.400 --> 32:53.520
 the same controversial weight.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.680
 And yet estrogen has some very powerful effects

32:56.680 --> 32:59.680
 on both the animal brain and on the human brain

32:59.680 --> 33:02.080
 of males and females.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.900
 Men do not want their estrogen to go too low.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.040
 Terrible things happen.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.960
 They will lose cognitive function.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.920
 Libido can drop.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.640
 So men need estrogen as well.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.300
 But perhaps maybe we can put the same filter on estrogen

33:17.300 --> 33:19.400
 as we did on testosterone.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.920
 Are there any general themes of estrogen

33:21.920 --> 33:24.760
 that people should be aware of

33:24.760 --> 33:27.680
 or that you think that are generally misunderstood?

33:27.680 --> 33:30.080
 Is it really all about feelings and empathy

33:30.080 --> 33:31.360
 and making us more sensitive?

33:31.360 --> 33:34.240
 I sense not.

33:34.240 --> 33:38.000
 No, and it's once again, very context dependent.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.220
 And if estrogen after giving birth

33:41.220 --> 33:44.340
 is playing a central role in you wanting to shred the face

33:44.340 --> 33:48.320
 of somebody getting too close to your kittens kind of thing,

33:48.320 --> 33:53.320
 we know it's not just warm, fuzzy, empathic kind of stuff.

33:53.640 --> 33:58.640
 Estrogen in lots of ways could be summarized by

33:58.800 --> 34:00.240
 if you had a choice in the matter

34:00.240 --> 34:03.360
 between having a lot of estrogen in your bloodstream or not,

34:03.360 --> 34:05.720
 go for having a lot of estrogen.

34:05.720 --> 34:10.000
 It enhances cognition exactly as you said.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.560
 It stimulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

34:13.560 --> 34:17.000
 It increases glucose and oxygen delivery.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.680
 It protects you from dementia.

34:19.680 --> 34:23.200
 It decreases inflammatory oxidative damage

34:23.200 --> 34:25.620
 to blood vessels, which is why it's good

34:25.620 --> 34:28.440
 for protecting from cardiovascular disease

34:28.440 --> 34:30.440
 in contrast to testosterone,

34:30.440 --> 34:33.220
 which is making every one of those things worse.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.200
 This brings up this minefield of the question,

34:38.200 --> 34:42.320
 which is so what about post-menopausal estrogen?

34:42.320 --> 34:46.400
 And all sorts of lab studies with non-human primates

34:46.400 --> 34:50.480
 suggested that you keep estrogen levels high

34:50.480 --> 34:53.040
 after a monkey's equivalent of menopause

34:53.040 --> 34:56.240
 and you're gonna keep brain health a lot better,

34:56.240 --> 35:01.000
 decreasing the risk of dementia, stroke, every such thing.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.900
 Estrogen is a great antioxidant, all of that.

35:03.900 --> 35:08.440
 So in the nineties, I think when Healy,

35:09.880 --> 35:11.360
 I'm forgetting her name,

35:11.360 --> 35:15.600
 but when there was the first female head of the NIH,

35:15.600 --> 35:20.600
 Bernadette Healy, set up this massive prospective

35:21.520 --> 35:25.120
 human study, what was gonna be the biggest one of all times,

35:25.120 --> 35:27.440
 looking at the pluses and minuses

35:27.440 --> 35:29.680
 of post-menopausal estrogen.

35:29.680 --> 35:33.400
 And tens of thousands of women, and this was gonna be,

35:33.400 --> 35:36.560
 and they had to cut the study short

35:36.560 --> 35:39.400
 because what they were seeing was estrogen

35:39.400 --> 35:42.880
 was not only doing the normal bad stuff that you expect

35:42.880 --> 35:46.280
 in terms of some decalcification stuff,

35:46.280 --> 35:49.920
 but it was increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.760
 And it was increasing the risk of stroke

35:51.760 --> 35:54.280
 and it was increasing the risk of dementia.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.240
 And this ground to a halt and everybody,

35:57.240 --> 35:59.820
 they stopped the study in front page news

35:59.820 --> 36:02.400
 and everybody had that point.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.760
 And nobody could make sense of it,

36:04.760 --> 36:06.720
 who had been spending the last 20 years

36:06.720 --> 36:08.920
 studying the exact same thing in primates

36:08.920 --> 36:11.400
 and seeing all the protective effects.

36:11.400 --> 36:16.400
 And the explanation turned out to be one of those things

36:16.480 --> 36:20.320
 where like law of unexpected consequences.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.680
 Okay, menopause in women that last different lengths of time

36:24.680 --> 36:26.700
 that may be a factor that's gonna come.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.760
 You know what?

36:27.760 --> 36:31.320
 Let's not start giving our study subjects more estrogen

36:31.320 --> 36:34.260
 until they're totally past menopause.

36:34.260 --> 36:38.160
 And when you've got that lag time in between,

36:38.160 --> 36:41.520
 you shift all sorts of estrogen receptor patterns

36:41.520 --> 36:44.500
 and that's where all of the bad effects come from.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.000
 All of the monkey studies had involved

36:47.000 --> 36:50.920
 just maintaining ovulatory levels

36:50.920 --> 36:53.320
 into the post-menopausal period.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.280
 And you do that and you get great effects.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.680
 Estrogen is one of the greatest predictors

36:57.680 --> 37:00.680
 of protection from Alzheimer's disease, all of that,

37:00.680 --> 37:04.220
 but it needs to be physiological.

37:04.220 --> 37:08.100
 Just keep continuing what your body has been doing

37:08.100 --> 37:11.680
 for a long time versus let the whole thing shut down

37:11.680 --> 37:15.000
 and suddenly like try to fire up the coal stoves

37:15.000 --> 37:17.280
 at the bottom of the basement kind of thing

37:17.280 --> 37:18.520
 and get that going.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.080
 There you get utterly different outcomes.

37:21.080 --> 37:25.320
 And that caused a lot of human health consequences

37:25.320 --> 37:28.540
 when people suddenly decided that estrogen

37:28.540 --> 37:33.540
 is in fact neurologically endangering post-menopausal A.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.400
 Wow, that's fascinating.

37:35.400 --> 37:39.060
 And I never thought that these steroid hormone receptors

37:39.060 --> 37:42.400
 could, you know, by not binding estrogen,

37:42.400 --> 37:44.920
 being devoid of estrogen binding, I should say,

37:44.920 --> 37:49.080
 could then set off opposite biochemical cascades.

37:49.080 --> 37:49.920
 Fascinating.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.840
 I guess it raises the question

37:50.840 --> 37:52.500
 about testosterone replacement too,

37:52.500 --> 37:56.280
 whether or not people should talk to their doctor

37:56.280 --> 37:58.920
 before too long.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.960
 Men and women talk to your physicians before too long

38:01.960 --> 38:05.200
 to avoid these, whatever is happening in these periods

38:05.200 --> 38:08.960
 where there isn't sufficient testosterone and or estrogen.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.820
 It sounds like it could cause longer term problems

38:11.820 --> 38:14.920
 even when therapies are introduced.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.680
 Two additional misery slash complications.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.360
 So, okay, you're trying to understand,

38:20.360 --> 38:22.520
 you look at women with a history

38:22.520 --> 38:25.600
 with or without post-menopausal estrogen replacement

38:25.600 --> 38:27.560
 where it's done right.

38:27.560 --> 38:30.500
 And you're seeing 20 years later,

38:30.500 --> 38:33.760
 estrogen is a predictor of a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.520
 Then you got to start trying to do

38:36.520 --> 38:40.360
 the unpacking prospective type studies.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.200
 How much estrogen?

38:42.200 --> 38:44.120
 At which times?

38:44.120 --> 38:49.120
 Estrogen is just a catch-all term for a bunch of hormones,

38:49.120 --> 38:52.080
 estrone, estradiol, estriol.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.800
 How much of each one of them?

38:53.800 --> 38:55.640
 Natural or synthetic?

38:55.640 --> 38:57.680
 Go try to figure all of that out.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.800
 And the second complication is,

38:59.800 --> 39:03.500
 it's often hard to say anything about what estrogen does,

39:03.500 --> 39:07.040
 outside the context of what progesterone is doing.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.040
 And often it's not the absolute levels of either,

39:10.040 --> 39:11.920
 it's the ratio of the two.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.480
 This is such a more complicated endocrine system

39:15.480 --> 39:17.700
 than testosterone.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.040
 And, you know,

39:19.040 --> 39:23.400
 because you have to generate dramatic cyclicity

39:23.400 --> 39:27.420
 that like no male hypothalamus ever has to dream of.

39:27.420 --> 39:30.360
 It's a much, much more complicated system.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.360
 Thus, it's more complicated to understand

39:33.360 --> 39:38.360
 let alone like figure out what the ideal benefits are of it.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.380
 Yeah.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.800
 I don't know what to make of the literature

39:42.800 --> 39:46.060
 on dropping rates of testosterone

39:46.060 --> 39:47.960
 and endocrine disruptors.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.120
 You know, I was at Berkeley when Tyrone Hayes

39:50.120 --> 39:52.160
 published his data on these frogs

39:52.160 --> 39:54.860
 that were drinking water from various locations

39:54.860 --> 39:57.220
 throughout the United States, not just in California,

39:57.220 --> 40:01.040
 and seeing very severe endocrine disruption

40:01.040 --> 40:04.880
 through blockade and of androgen receptors

40:04.880 --> 40:05.840
 and all sorts of issues.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.520
 And you hear this all the time now

40:07.520 --> 40:09.140
 that sperm counts are dropping,

40:09.140 --> 40:11.080
 that there are all these endocrine disruptors,

40:11.080 --> 40:13.460
 that there's birth control in the water,

40:13.460 --> 40:14.520
 in the drinking water.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.680
 It all starts to sound a little crazy.

40:16.680 --> 40:21.680
 And yet I've also been fooled before by, you know,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.500
 I guess a good example would be

40:24.500 --> 40:26.980
 there's a lot of crazy stuff in the world online

40:26.980 --> 40:29.760
 about all the terrible stuff in highly processed foods.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.980
 And yet you've got very respectable people,

40:31.980 --> 40:34.860
 endocrinologists at UCSF, like Robert Lustig saying,

40:34.860 --> 40:37.040
 yeah, these, a lot of these hidden sugars

40:37.040 --> 40:39.220
 and these emulsifiers, they're causing real problems.

40:39.220 --> 40:42.920
 So I've become more open-minded about the question.

40:43.920 --> 40:48.920
 And so are we suffering from drops in sperm counts

40:49.520 --> 40:51.960
 and testosterone and estrogen and fertility

40:51.960 --> 40:54.560
 as a consequence of endocrine disruptors

40:54.560 --> 40:56.560
 in the environments and food,

40:56.560 --> 40:59.600
 or because of social reasons?

40:59.600 --> 41:01.520
 Is there anything that we can hang our hat on,

41:01.520 --> 41:04.060
 like real data that you're confident in,

41:04.060 --> 41:05.240
 or is it just a mess?

41:06.240 --> 41:09.820
 No, the phenomenon does appear to be quite real.

41:10.900 --> 41:14.400
 Cross-sectional studies, human populations,

41:14.400 --> 41:16.880
 or I still don't understand why this was one

41:16.880 --> 41:19.140
 of the first things that Hayes spotted,

41:19.140 --> 41:22.720
 decreasing testicle size in crocodiles.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.740
 Go figure why that was one of the first contributions

41:26.740 --> 41:27.700
 to this.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.640
 And I think the phenomenon is absolutely real.

41:30.640 --> 41:34.760
 And what you're then left with is two classic challenges,

41:34.760 --> 41:38.320
 which is this is correlated with something broad,

41:38.320 --> 41:43.320
 environmental toxins, which ones, how much, when, et cetera.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.160
 And the other one always being, well, okay, dropping.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.120
 Is it dropping enough to make a difference?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.600
 How big of an effect is this?

41:50.600 --> 41:54.080
 And those are where the juries are still out.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.440
 Yeah, it's an area that I know

41:55.440 --> 41:56.780
 there's a lot of interest in.

41:56.780 --> 42:00.160
 And you've got groups of people who won't touch a receipt

42:00.160 --> 42:03.560
 at a store because of the BPAs that are on the inks of the,

42:03.560 --> 42:07.440
 and then you've got people who don't care about those things.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.360
 It is a fascinating area.

42:09.360 --> 42:13.080
 And I hope that more biology will be done there soon.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.680
 I'd like to briefly return to stress.

42:16.700 --> 42:21.480
 You described a study once about two rats,

42:23.080 --> 42:26.240
 one running on a wheel voluntarily,

42:26.240 --> 42:30.260
 one who's basically stuck in a running wheel

42:30.260 --> 42:33.340
 and is forced to run anytime rat number one runs.

42:33.340 --> 42:36.740
 So in one case, the rat is voluntarily exercising.

42:36.740 --> 42:37.700
 And in the other case,

42:37.700 --> 42:41.600
 the rat is being forced to go to PE class, so to speak,

42:41.600 --> 42:46.600
 but really, and seeing divergent effects on biology.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.040
 And I'd like to just touch into this

42:49.040 --> 42:50.620
 and use it as kind of a case study

42:50.620 --> 42:52.980
 for stress mitigation in general.

42:52.980 --> 42:57.000
 I'm rather obsessed in our colleague, David Spiegel,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.680
 associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford

42:58.680 --> 43:00.400
 is obsessed with this question

43:00.400 --> 43:03.960
 of how humans can start to mitigate their own stress.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.480
 What do you think about stress mitigation

43:07.480 --> 43:12.320
 and what should we do as individuals and as families

43:12.320 --> 43:14.720
 and as a culture to try and encourage people

43:14.720 --> 43:16.640
 to mitigate their stress,

43:16.640 --> 43:19.080
 but in ways that are not going to turn us

43:19.080 --> 43:20.160
 into rat number two,

43:20.160 --> 43:22.520
 where we're being forced to mitigate our own stress

43:22.520 --> 43:24.840
 and therefore becomes more stressful?

43:24.840 --> 43:27.420
 And what you see is rat number one

43:27.420 --> 43:30.040
 gets all the benefits of exercise.

43:30.040 --> 43:34.100
 Rat number two gets all the downsides of severe stress

43:34.100 --> 43:37.720
 with the same exact muscle expenditure

43:37.720 --> 43:40.920
 and movements going on, perfectly yoked,

43:40.920 --> 43:45.040
 great example that it's the interpretation in your head.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.800
 And I haven't kept up with that literature,

43:47.800 --> 43:50.000
 but I'll bet you rat number two

43:50.000 --> 43:51.840
 is having a whole lot more activity

43:51.840 --> 43:54.620
 in its amygdala than is rat number one.

43:55.640 --> 43:59.000
 Okay, so stress mitigation.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.760
 Anything I should say here,

44:00.760 --> 44:04.520
 I should preface with I'm reasonably good

44:04.520 --> 44:06.760
 at telling people what's going to happen

44:06.760 --> 44:08.760
 if they don't manage their stress,

44:08.760 --> 44:12.440
 but I'm terrible at actually like managing stress

44:12.440 --> 44:14.600
 or advising how to manage it.

44:14.600 --> 44:18.200
 I'm much better with the bad news aspect of it.

44:18.200 --> 44:21.540
 But what do you see is by now,

44:21.540 --> 44:25.000
 just a classic literature, half a century old,

44:25.000 --> 44:29.420
 sort of showing what are the building blocks of stress.

44:29.420 --> 44:31.400
 Not, ooh, you step outside

44:31.400 --> 44:33.000
 and you've been gored by an elephant

44:33.000 --> 44:36.880
 and can you grow from your experience

44:36.880 --> 44:39.600
 and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.240
 You could have a stress response,

44:41.240 --> 44:44.960
 but you're in the realm of the gray zone

44:44.960 --> 44:48.920
 of ambiguous social interactions, that sort of thing.

44:48.920 --> 44:51.240
 Some people have massive stress responses,

44:51.240 --> 44:53.760
 others not at all in between, enjoy it.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.440
 Like what are the building blocks

44:55.440 --> 44:58.160
 of what makes psychological stress stressful?

44:58.160 --> 45:01.520
 And the first one is exactly what is brought up

45:01.520 --> 45:03.680
 by that running study.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.480
 Do you have a sense of control?

45:06.480 --> 45:10.360
 A sense of control makes stressors less stressful.

45:10.360 --> 45:14.540
 And the running wheel shows that or studies where you,

45:14.540 --> 45:18.400
 you lab rat or you college freshmen volunteer

45:18.400 --> 45:20.580
 have been trained that by pressing a lever,

45:20.580 --> 45:22.840
 you're less likely to get a shock.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.840
 And today you're at the lever,

45:24.840 --> 45:27.080
 they're working away and unbeknownst to you,

45:27.080 --> 45:28.640
 the lever has been turned off

45:28.640 --> 45:31.240
 and it has no effect on shock frequency,

45:31.240 --> 45:33.560
 but because you think you have some control,

45:33.560 --> 45:35.440
 you have less of a stress response.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.040
 If you were a rat and doing this day in and day out,

45:38.040 --> 45:40.140
 you're less likely to get an ulcer.

45:40.140 --> 45:41.960
 So a sense of control.

45:41.960 --> 45:46.360
 Related to that is a sense of predictability.

45:46.360 --> 45:49.440
 Rat gets shocked, human gets shocked, whatever.

45:49.440 --> 45:53.160
 And the scenario either is the shocks come now and then,

45:53.160 --> 45:54.700
 or the shocks come now and then,

45:54.700 --> 45:59.080
 and 10 seconds before a little warning light comes on.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.920
 And when you get the warning light,

46:00.920 --> 46:03.260
 the shocks aren't as stressful.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.020
 You got predictability

46:05.020 --> 46:07.480
 because if you're not getting warning lights,

46:07.480 --> 46:10.080
 any second you could be a half second away

46:10.080 --> 46:13.020
 from the next shock, you get a warning light

46:13.020 --> 46:14.940
 and you know that if there isn't one,

46:14.940 --> 46:17.940
 you've got at least 10 seconds worth of relaxation.

46:17.940 --> 46:19.880
 You know what's coming, you can prepare

46:19.880 --> 46:23.600
 your coping responses and best of all,

46:23.600 --> 46:26.580
 afterward, you know when you're finally safe,

46:26.580 --> 46:28.600
 when you can recover from it.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.000
 And that's enormously protective.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.340
 Others, outlet for frustration.

46:35.340 --> 46:37.560
 You take a rat who's getting shocked

46:37.560 --> 46:39.600
 and if it could run on a running wheel,

46:39.600 --> 46:43.200
 that's a protective thing if it's doing it voluntarily.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.280
 If you've got a rat and it can gnaw on a bar of wood,

46:47.280 --> 46:50.120
 a stressor is less stressful.

46:50.120 --> 46:54.440
 Unfortunately, if you have a rat or primate or human

46:54.440 --> 46:58.680
 and they're stressed, the ability to aggressively dump

46:58.680 --> 47:01.200
 on somebody smaller and weaker

47:01.200 --> 47:03.440
 also reduces the stress response

47:03.440 --> 47:05.200
 and displacement aggression,

47:05.200 --> 47:08.760
 and the fact that displacement aggression reduces stress

47:08.760 --> 47:12.920
 accounts for a huge percentage of Earth's unhappiness.

47:12.920 --> 47:16.080
 So all of those variables get social support as well.

47:16.080 --> 47:18.640
 That's a good one, interpreting circumstances

47:18.640 --> 47:20.360
 as being good news rather than bad.

47:20.360 --> 47:22.720
 Hooray, so you've got this very simple

47:22.720 --> 47:25.480
 sort of like take home recipe of go out

47:25.480 --> 47:28.840
 and get as much control and as much predictability

47:28.840 --> 47:32.560
 and as many outlets and as much social support as possible,

47:32.560 --> 47:33.920
 and you're gonna do just fine.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.200
 And you go out and do that

47:35.200 --> 47:37.960
 and that's a recipe for total disaster,

47:37.960 --> 47:41.600
 because it's much, much more subtle than that.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.400
 One great example.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.960
 Okay, so you're getting shocked.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.080
 You want a warning beforehand.

47:47.080 --> 47:49.680
 Get a little warning light 10 seconds before each shock.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.600
 It's wonderfully protective.

47:51.600 --> 47:56.600
 Get a warning light one second before the shock.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.000
 Doesn't do anything.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.120
 There's not enough time for you

47:59.120 --> 48:03.360
 to get the psychological benefits of the anticipation.

48:03.360 --> 48:06.240
 Now instead, get the little warning coming on

48:06.240 --> 48:08.920
 two minutes before each shock,

48:08.920 --> 48:10.880
 and it's gonna make things worse,

48:10.880 --> 48:12.920
 because you're not gonna be sitting there

48:12.920 --> 48:17.920
 like reveling in sort of your sense of predictability

48:18.800 --> 48:20.280
 and it's soon gonna be over.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.560
 You're gonna be sitting there for two minutes saying,

48:22.560 --> 48:24.360
 damn, here it comes.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.840
 Predictive information only works in a narrow domain.

48:28.840 --> 48:31.800
 Similarly, control.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.280
 Do you wanna have a sense of control in the face of stress?

48:35.280 --> 48:40.280
 And the answer is only if it is a mild to moderate stressor,

48:40.280 --> 48:42.920
 because what's happening then,

48:42.920 --> 48:45.160
 your sense of control is completely independent

48:45.160 --> 48:47.960
 of the reality of whether you have control or not.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.440
 But in the face of mild to moderate stressors,

48:50.440 --> 48:53.400
 a sense of control gets interpreted as,

48:53.400 --> 48:57.320
 wow, look how much worse things could have been.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.040
 Thank God I have control.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.600
 I'm on top of this to master my fate.

49:00.600 --> 49:04.040
 In contrast, if it's a major stressor,

49:04.040 --> 49:08.000
 all that a arbitrary sense of control does

49:08.000 --> 49:10.680
 is make you think, oh my God,

49:10.680 --> 49:13.480
 look how much better it could have been.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.120
 I could have prevented it.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.880
 And we all know that intuitively,

49:16.880 --> 49:21.400
 like we do that in the face of people's worst stressors.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.400
 Nobody could have stopped the car

49:23.400 --> 49:25.960
 the way the kids suddenly jumped out.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.320
 It wouldn't have mattered if you had gotten them

49:28.320 --> 49:31.280
 to the doctor a month ago instead of now,

49:31.280 --> 49:32.320
 it wouldn't have made me,

49:32.320 --> 49:35.360
 you didn't actually have any control.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.200
 And what you see is you absolutely want to have

49:39.200 --> 49:42.960
 a huge sense of control over mild to moderate stressors

49:42.960 --> 49:45.440
 and especially ones that result in a good outcome.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.800
 Hooray for me.

49:46.800 --> 49:50.200
 And in the face of horrible stressors,

49:50.200 --> 49:54.840
 what you want to do is like self-deception

49:54.840 --> 49:58.040
 and like truth and beauty don't necessarily

49:58.040 --> 50:00.400
 go hand in hand at that point.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.000
 And that's why stress management techniques

50:03.000 --> 50:05.160
 about control and predictability

50:05.160 --> 50:07.720
 wind up being far worse than neutral

50:07.720 --> 50:10.960
 if you're preaching that to somebody homeless

50:10.960 --> 50:13.280
 or somebody with terminal cancer

50:13.280 --> 50:15.920
 or somebody who's a refugee,

50:15.920 --> 50:18.480
 tell a neurotic middle-class person

50:18.480 --> 50:20.800
 that they have the psychological tools

50:20.800 --> 50:23.400
 to turn hell into heaven.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.000
 And there's some truth to that.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.720
 Do the same thing to somebody

50:26.720 --> 50:29.040
 who's going through a real hell

50:29.040 --> 50:34.040
 and that's just privileged heartlessness to do that

50:34.040 --> 50:36.200
 because that doesn't work.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.240
 More and more, you know, outlets,

50:38.240 --> 50:40.080
 if your outlets are damaging,

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
 that's not a good way to mitigate stress.

50:42.080 --> 50:45.600
 Social support, if you're confusing mere acquaintances

50:45.600 --> 50:47.360
 for real social support,

50:47.360 --> 50:48.760
 you're going to have the rug pulled out

50:48.760 --> 50:50.240
 from under you at some point.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.360
 If you're mistaking social support for being,

50:53.360 --> 50:55.000
 going and bitching and moaning

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
 and demanding supportiveness from everyone around you,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.960
 rather than you doing some of that reciprocally,

51:00.960 --> 51:03.200
 that's not going to work very well either.

51:03.200 --> 51:07.560
 Well either, you know, it's not simple.

51:07.560 --> 51:11.640
 It's not for nothing that lots of us are really lousy

51:11.640 --> 51:15.120
 at being good friends and things like that

51:15.120 --> 51:19.680
 and why it takes a lot of work to do it right

51:19.680 --> 51:22.200
 because you do it wrong

51:22.200 --> 51:25.240
 and it may temporarily seem like a great thing,

51:25.240 --> 51:29.320
 but when it turns out to be completely misplaced faith,

51:29.320 --> 51:33.140
 you're going to be feeling worse than before you started.

51:33.140 --> 51:33.980
 Interesting.

51:33.980 --> 51:35.400
 These days, there's a lot of interest

51:35.400 --> 51:38.360
 in using physical practices to mitigate stress,

51:38.360 --> 51:40.960
 you know, trying to get out of the ruminating

51:40.960 --> 51:42.960
 and to some extent,

51:42.960 --> 51:46.060
 take control of neural circuits in the brain

51:46.060 --> 51:51.060
 by using exercise and using breathing and hypnosis.

51:51.360 --> 51:55.280
 And of course, hypnosis has a mental component as well.

51:55.280 --> 51:59.380
 So what are your thoughts on stress mitigation

51:59.380 --> 52:00.780
 from the standpoint of, okay,

52:00.780 --> 52:02.420
 so we don't want to be rat number two,

52:02.420 --> 52:04.340
 we want to select something for ourselves.

52:04.340 --> 52:07.680
 So we have to take the initiative for ourselves,

52:07.680 --> 52:10.380
 being forced into exercising is not,

52:10.380 --> 52:13.240
 it could actually have negative health effects perhaps.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.980
 So we need to pick something that we like,

52:14.980 --> 52:16.620
 we need to take control of it.

52:17.860 --> 52:19.700
 In terms of supporting other people,

52:19.700 --> 52:21.080
 you touched on that a bit,

52:21.080 --> 52:23.040
 what is the best way to support other people?

52:23.040 --> 52:25.620
 Is it to talk about the stressful thing?

52:25.620 --> 52:27.640
 I mean, I'm not asking you to play psychologist here,

52:27.640 --> 52:30.660
 but I find divergent data on this.

52:30.660 --> 52:34.760
 You know, we can spin ourselves up into a lather

52:34.760 --> 52:36.700
 by ruminating on something.

52:36.700 --> 52:41.100
 And language seems to me like it's a wonderful tool,

52:41.100 --> 52:44.640
 but it's also a fairly deprived tool

52:44.640 --> 52:46.620
 because it doesn't really get into the core

52:46.620 --> 52:49.900
 of our physiology like something like breathing would.

52:49.900 --> 52:53.860
 So what are your thoughts on more, for lack of a better way

52:53.860 --> 52:56.580
 to put it, more head-centered cognitive approaches

52:56.580 --> 52:59.140
 to stress mitigation versus kind of going

52:59.140 --> 53:02.020
 at the core physiology, cold showers now,

53:02.020 --> 53:04.300
 or even a thing to some extent, you know,

53:04.300 --> 53:06.340
 just to get people stress acclimated,

53:06.340 --> 53:09.480
 voluntarily taking cold showers, you know?

53:09.480 --> 53:13.820
 That makes some sense physiologically preconditioning

53:13.820 --> 53:16.420
 for when the real stressors come.

53:16.420 --> 53:18.580
 In terms of what you bring up,

53:18.580 --> 53:22.740
 wow, transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise,

53:22.740 --> 53:27.740
 prayer, sort of reflecting on gratitude,

53:28.060 --> 53:29.340
 all that sort of thing.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.720
 Collectively, they work on the average.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.280
 They work in terms of they can lower heart rate

53:35.280 --> 53:38.880
 and cholesterol levels and have all sorts of good outcomes,

53:38.880 --> 53:40.980
 but they come with provisos.

53:40.980 --> 53:43.820
 One is exactly the caveat that comes out

53:43.820 --> 53:46.600
 of the running wheel study is it doesn't matter

53:46.600 --> 53:49.660
 how many of your friends swear by this stress management

53:49.660 --> 53:52.820
 technique, if doing it makes you want to screen your head

53:52.820 --> 53:54.820
 off after 10 seconds,

53:54.820 --> 53:56.580
 that's not the one that's going to work for you.

53:56.580 --> 54:00.420
 So, you know, read the fine print and the testimonials,

54:00.420 --> 54:02.220
 but it's gotta be something that works for you.

54:02.220 --> 54:06.700
 Another one is the stress management type techniques

54:06.700 --> 54:11.140
 that work, you can't save them for the weekend.

54:11.140 --> 54:13.500
 You can't save them for when you're stuck on hold

54:13.500 --> 54:16.040
 on the phone with Muzak for two minutes.

54:16.040 --> 54:20.380
 It's gotta be something where you stop what you're doing

54:20.380 --> 54:23.420
 and do it virtually daily or every other day

54:23.420 --> 54:26.260
 and spend 20, 30 minutes doing it.

54:26.260 --> 54:28.220
 And what you see coming out of that

54:28.220 --> 54:32.540
 is this like 80, 20 rule from economics,

54:32.540 --> 54:35.340
 80, 20, 80% of the complaints in the store

54:35.340 --> 54:37.860
 come from 20% of the customers, things like that.

54:37.860 --> 54:40.980
 What you see is if your entire life consists

54:40.980 --> 54:45.260
 of every single thing on your shoulders

54:45.260 --> 54:48.700
 that you can't say no to 24 seven,

54:48.700 --> 54:52.160
 if you've stopped that and finally said,

54:52.160 --> 54:54.340
 my wellbeing is important enough

54:54.340 --> 54:56.420
 that I'm finally going to say no to some of the stuff

54:56.420 --> 54:57.780
 that I can't say no to,

54:57.780 --> 55:00.540
 and I'm going to do it every day for 20 minutes,

55:00.540 --> 55:03.060
 whatever stress management technique you then do

55:03.060 --> 55:06.240
 in those 20 minutes, short of who knows what,

55:06.240 --> 55:08.680
 you're already 80% of the way there

55:08.680 --> 55:13.340
 simply by having decided your wellbeing is important enough

55:13.340 --> 55:15.860
 that you're going to stop every single day

55:15.860 --> 55:17.700
 and have that as priority.

55:17.700 --> 55:19.300
 And that's exactly the same finding

55:19.300 --> 55:23.020
 that you find people with chronic depression untreated

55:23.020 --> 55:26.040
 that merely calling and getting an appointment

55:26.040 --> 55:28.200
 to see a mental health professional,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.640
 people start feeling better already

55:30.640 --> 55:34.460
 because it's evidence that you've been activated

55:34.460 --> 55:37.140
 and you matter enough to do this

55:37.140 --> 55:39.140
 and you could conceive that this would actually

55:39.140 --> 55:41.940
 have a good outcome rather than a hopeless one.

55:41.940 --> 55:46.900
 Just doing something meditative or reflective every day

55:46.900 --> 55:51.900
 or so, and it hardly even matters which one you're doing.

55:52.020 --> 55:55.100
 And what comes out of that is thus another warning,

55:55.100 --> 55:58.600
 which is do not trust anybody who says

55:58.600 --> 56:00.740
 it has been scientifically proven

56:00.740 --> 56:03.260
 that their brand of stress management

56:03.260 --> 56:04.940
 works better than the other ones.

56:04.940 --> 56:08.100
 Just watch your wallet at that point.

56:08.100 --> 56:12.100
 Yeah, amen, I think one of the core goals of my lab

56:12.100 --> 56:14.140
 and David Spiegel's lab, and I know you've worked

56:14.140 --> 56:16.540
 with David and published papers with David as well,

56:16.540 --> 56:19.460
 is to really try and find out what are the various

56:19.460 --> 56:21.600
 entry points to this thing that we call

56:21.600 --> 56:23.840
 the autonomic nervous system and the stress system

56:23.840 --> 56:26.700
 and the systems that when gone unchecked

56:26.700 --> 56:29.740
 really can take us down a dark path.

56:29.740 --> 56:31.980
 And the idea that there are so many entry points

56:31.980 --> 56:33.500
 is really the one that keeps,

56:33.500 --> 56:35.460
 what the data keep telling us over and over again.

56:35.460 --> 56:39.060
 So there's no magic breathing tool or exercise.

56:39.060 --> 56:42.700
 It's any variety of those or one of those.

56:42.700 --> 56:44.580
 And again, we come back to this idea

56:44.580 --> 56:45.860
 that it's the one that you select

56:45.860 --> 56:47.580
 and the one that you make space for,

56:47.580 --> 56:50.700
 and it's the one that you hopefully enjoy

56:50.700 --> 56:54.200
 that's going to work best in terms of physiology.

56:54.200 --> 56:56.820
 And one that's benign for those people

56:56.820 --> 56:58.420
 who were stuck around you.

56:58.420 --> 57:00.500
 Right, right, absolutely.

57:00.500 --> 57:04.900
 And that brings me to this question of I find it amazing

57:04.900 --> 57:08.180
 that how we perceive an event

57:08.180 --> 57:12.220
 and whether or not we chose to be in that event or not

57:12.220 --> 57:16.140
 can have such incredibly different effects

57:16.140 --> 57:19.500
 on circuitry of the brain and circuitry of the body

57:19.500 --> 57:21.100
 and biology of cells.

57:21.940 --> 57:24.060
 And in some ways it boggles my mind,

57:24.060 --> 57:26.700
 like how can a decision made presumably

57:26.700 --> 57:28.380
 with the prefrontal cortex,

57:28.380 --> 57:30.260
 although other parts of the brain as well,

57:30.260 --> 57:33.400
 how can that change essentially the polarity

57:33.400 --> 57:36.260
 of a response in the body?

57:36.260 --> 57:39.660
 And I mean, you've talked before about type A personalities

57:39.660 --> 57:41.780
 and we don't have to go into all the detail there

57:41.780 --> 57:42.620
 for sake of time,

57:42.620 --> 57:46.260
 but it is interesting that the effects of endothelial cells,

57:46.260 --> 57:51.260
 I mean, literally of the size of the portals for blood

57:51.700 --> 57:53.300
 are in opposite direction,

57:53.300 --> 57:55.140
 depending on whether or not somebody

57:55.140 --> 57:58.500
 wants to be in a situation, is a highly motivated person.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.100
 Maybe you could just give us the top contour of that

58:01.100 --> 58:03.900
 because I think it really illustrates this principle

58:03.900 --> 58:04.860
 so beautifully.

58:04.860 --> 58:06.660
 And then maybe if you would,

58:06.660 --> 58:10.320
 you could just speculate on how the brain might have

58:10.320 --> 58:14.760
 this switch to turn one experience from terrible

58:14.760 --> 58:18.660
 to beneficial or from beneficial to terrible.

58:18.660 --> 58:20.100
 It's really fascinating.

58:20.100 --> 58:24.180
 Well, I mean, all you need to do is like tonight

58:24.180 --> 58:27.780
 before you're going to sleep and you're lying in bed

58:27.780 --> 58:29.180
 and you're nice and drowsy

58:29.180 --> 58:31.680
 and your heart's beating nice and slow,

58:31.680 --> 58:34.420
 you'll start thinking about the fact that, you know,

58:34.420 --> 58:36.820
 that heart isn't going to beat forever.

58:36.820 --> 58:41.220
 And imagine your toes getting cold afterward

58:41.220 --> 58:44.420
 and imagine the flow of blood coming to a halt

58:44.420 --> 58:46.180
 and all of you clotting.

58:46.180 --> 58:47.340
 And if you're really,

58:47.340 --> 58:49.700
 you're going to be doing something with your physiology

58:49.700 --> 58:52.820
 at that point that 99% of mammals out there only do

58:52.820 --> 58:54.820
 if they're running frantically.

58:54.820 --> 58:57.020
 And you're going to be turning on your synthetic

58:57.020 --> 59:00.420
 stress response with thought, with emotions, with memory.

59:00.420 --> 59:05.420
 And the measure of that is just how much the cortex

59:06.420 --> 59:09.060
 and the limbic system sends projections down

59:09.060 --> 59:12.560
 to all the autonomic regulators in the brain.

59:12.560 --> 59:17.340
 You can think autonomic regulatory neurons into action

59:17.340 --> 59:21.000
 in ways that only other animals can do with like extremes

59:21.000 --> 59:23.620
 of environmental circumstances.

59:23.620 --> 59:27.940
 And given that and the autonomic rule,

59:27.940 --> 59:30.420
 I mean the other big challenge in understanding it

59:30.420 --> 59:34.160
 is gigantic individual differences.

59:34.160 --> 59:37.700
 And that's, you know,

59:37.700 --> 59:40.820
 we talk about the optimal amount of stress

59:40.820 --> 59:42.580
 that counts as stimulation.

59:42.580 --> 59:46.660
 And in general, that stress that's not too severe

59:46.660 --> 59:48.060
 and doesn't go on for too long

59:48.060 --> 59:50.340
 and is overall in a benevolent setting.

59:50.340 --> 59:51.540
 And under those conditions,

59:51.540 --> 59:54.820
 we love being stressed by something unexpected

59:54.820 --> 59:56.580
 and out of control and predictability

59:56.580 --> 59:58.860
 like a really interesting plot turn

59:58.860 --> 1:00:00.340
 in the movie you're watching.

1:00:00.340 --> 1:00:03.740
 That's great, but you get the individual differences

1:00:03.740 --> 1:00:06.420
 that somehow has to accommodate the fact that

1:00:06.420 --> 1:00:10.820
 for some people, the perfect stimulatory amount of stress

1:00:10.820 --> 1:00:15.540
 is like getting up early for an Audubon bird watching walk

1:00:15.540 --> 1:00:16.780
 next Sunday morning.

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:17.780
 And for somebody else,

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:21.260
 it's signing up to be like a mercenary in Yemen.

1:00:21.260 --> 1:00:24.700
 And tremendous individual differences

1:00:24.700 --> 1:00:29.700
 that swamp any simple, you know, prescriptions.

1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:33.260
 Yeah, the prefrontal cortex,

1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:35.460
 this thinking machinery that we all harbor,

1:00:35.460 --> 1:00:37.900
 it's such a double-edged sword.

1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:42.900
 And what's remarkable to me is how the areas of the brain,

1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:44.860
 like the hypothalamus and the amygdala,

1:00:44.860 --> 1:00:46.460
 they're sort of like switches.

1:00:46.460 --> 1:00:49.100
 I mean, there's context and there's gain control.

1:00:49.100 --> 1:00:52.520
 You talked about the gain control by testosterone, et cetera,

1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:53.780
 but they're really like switches.

1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:56.580
 I mean, if you stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus,

1:00:56.580 --> 1:00:57.500
 you get the right neurons,

1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:00.020
 an animal will try and kill even an object

1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:00.840
 that's sitting next to it.

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:02.180
 You tickle some other neurons,

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:04.220
 it'll try and mate with that same object.

1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:05.920
 I mean, it's really wild.

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:09.460
 I think there are probably rules to prefrontal cortex also,

1:01:09.460 --> 1:01:13.520
 but it sounds like the context, plural,

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:16.820
 from which prefrontal cortex can draw from

1:01:16.820 --> 1:01:18.780
 is probably infinite.

1:01:18.780 --> 1:01:20.940
 So that we could probably learn

1:01:20.940 --> 1:01:22.740
 to perceive threat in anything,

1:01:22.740 --> 1:01:23.900
 whether or not it's another group

1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:26.000
 or whether or not it's science

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.540
 or whether or not it's somebody's version

1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:30.180
 of the shape of the earth versus another.

1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:33.820
 I mean, it's like you can plug in anything to this system

1:01:33.820 --> 1:01:35.300
 and give it enough data.

1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:37.860
 And I think it sounds like you could drive a fear response

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:39.100
 or a love response.

1:01:39.100 --> 1:01:40.580
 Is that overstepping?

1:01:40.580 --> 1:01:44.500
 Or a mixed, hardly ambivalent one

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:46.900
 that is changing by the millisecond

1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:49.940
 and then like initially contradictory?

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:51.500
 No, that's absolutely the case.

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.420
 And the prefrontal cortex,

1:01:53.420 --> 1:01:57.140
 I more than once have regretted

1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:59.700
 having like wasted 30 years of my life

1:01:59.700 --> 1:02:01.060
 studying the hippocampus

1:02:01.060 --> 1:02:03.660
 when I should have been studying the prefrontal cortex

1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:06.460
 because it's so much more interesting what it does.

1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:09.460
 And it's all this contextual stuff.

1:02:09.460 --> 1:02:12.620
 It's all the ways in which it's not okay

1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:14.280
 to lie in this setting,

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:16.420
 but it's a great thing in another.

1:02:16.420 --> 1:02:19.640
 It's not okay to kill unless you do it to them.

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:20.640
 And then you get a medal.

1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:24.300
 It's not all of this social context

1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:29.100
 and moral relativity and situational ethics stuff.

1:02:29.100 --> 1:02:32.040
 That's the prefrontal cortex that's got to master that.

1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:36.180
 And that winds up meaning that's the place

1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:37.940
 in your brain more than anywhere

1:02:37.940 --> 1:02:42.020
 where you say your perception of things

1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:44.460
 can powerfully influence the reality

1:02:44.460 --> 1:02:46.420
 of what's coming into you.

1:02:46.420 --> 1:02:51.420
 I mean, great example of just harking back to testosterone.

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:54.900
 Okay, so exercise boosts up testosterone levels.

1:02:54.900 --> 1:02:58.660
 Does exercise and success do it more than exercise

1:02:58.660 --> 1:03:02.560
 and failure of literature back in the 80s or so

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:05.060
 looking at outcomes of marathons.

1:03:05.060 --> 1:03:07.860
 Did testosterone rise more in the people who win

1:03:07.860 --> 1:03:09.160
 than the losers?

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:11.460
 Wrestling matches, things of that sort

1:03:11.460 --> 1:03:12.920
 with a simple prediction.

1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:14.220
 And the answer wound up being

1:03:14.220 --> 1:03:16.620
 you didn't see a simple answer.

1:03:16.620 --> 1:03:18.660
 Okay, you win the marathon.

1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:20.980
 That's not necessarily an increase,

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:23.140
 a predictor of increased testosterone.

1:03:23.140 --> 1:03:24.460
 What's that about?

1:03:24.460 --> 1:03:29.460
 And then you find like the winner testosterone decreases

1:03:29.660 --> 1:03:32.900
 and you find out the guy who came in 73rd

1:03:32.900 --> 1:03:35.860
 is having a massive testosterone increase.

1:03:35.860 --> 1:03:37.820
 Whoa, what's that about?

1:03:37.820 --> 1:03:40.520
 What's that about is far more human subtlety.

1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:44.040
 The guy who won the race has a decline in testosterone

1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:46.020
 because he came in three minutes later

1:03:46.020 --> 1:03:48.480
 than he really, really was expecting.

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:50.740
 And everybody now is going to be writing it up

1:03:50.740 --> 1:03:52.700
 about how he's over the hill.

1:03:52.700 --> 1:03:54.500
 And the guy who came in 73rd

1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:56.420
 is having a boost of testosterone

1:03:56.420 --> 1:03:59.260
 because he was assuming he'd be dead from a heart attack

1:03:59.260 --> 1:04:02.500
 by the third mile and instead he managed to finish.

1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:05.380
 It's this interpretive stuff going on in there

1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:08.300
 and that's what prefrontal cortex is about.

1:04:08.300 --> 1:04:09.240
 Amazing.

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:13.700
 It raises this question of cognitive flexibility.

1:04:13.700 --> 1:04:18.700
 Can we tell ourselves that something is good for us

1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:21.020
 even if we're not enjoying it?

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:23.260
 Can we wriggle around these corners

1:04:23.260 --> 1:04:28.260
 of choosing the exercise or doing the...

1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:34.400
 I personally am not a big fan of long bouts of meditation

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:35.620
 but I've benefited tremendously

1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:37.860
 from things like dedicated breathing

1:04:37.860 --> 1:04:40.220
 and shorter rounds of meditation.

1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:42.740
 Can I tell myself that it's good for me

1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:44.300
 and wriggle around the corner

1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:46.660
 and get my physiology working the way I want?

1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:48.540
 Do we have cognitive flexibility?

1:04:48.540 --> 1:04:52.000
 Can I be that third place runner and tell myself,

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.560
 well, at least I came in, I wanted to win so badly.

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:57.960
 That was my primary goal.

1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:01.260
 But another goal was to beat my previous time

1:05:01.260 --> 1:05:02.380
 and I did do that.

1:05:02.380 --> 1:05:07.380
 And so, I mean, to what extent can we toggle

1:05:08.060 --> 1:05:11.100
 this relationship between the prefrontal cortex

1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:14.740
 and these other more primitive systems?

1:05:14.740 --> 1:05:16.820
 And an enormous amount.

1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:23.260
 For example, being low in a hierarchy

1:05:23.260 --> 1:05:25.100
 is generally bad for health

1:05:25.100 --> 1:05:27.940
 and like every mammal out there, including us.

1:05:27.940 --> 1:05:29.340
 But we do something special,

1:05:29.340 --> 1:05:32.040
 which is we can be part of multiple hierarchies

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:33.460
 at the same time.

1:05:33.460 --> 1:05:36.320
 And while you may be low ranking in one of them,

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:38.860
 you could be extremely high ranking in another.

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:42.940
 You're like have the crappiest job in your corporation,

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:45.340
 but you're the captain of the team softball,

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:48.060
 of the softball team this year for the company.

1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:49.860
 And you better bet that's somebody

1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:51.820
 who's gonna find all sorts of ways

1:05:51.820 --> 1:05:54.300
 to decide that nine to five Monday to Friday

1:05:54.300 --> 1:05:56.540
 is just stupid paying the bills.

1:05:56.540 --> 1:06:00.500
 And what really matters is the prestige on the weekend.

1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:04.500
 You're poor, but you're the deacon of your church here.

1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:07.140
 And so we can play all sorts of psychological games

1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:07.980
 with that.

1:06:07.980 --> 1:06:11.580
 And one of the most like consistent reliable ones

1:06:11.580 --> 1:06:14.940
 that we do and need to use the frontal cortex like crazy

1:06:14.940 --> 1:06:18.460
 is somebody does something rotten

1:06:18.460 --> 1:06:20.340
 and you need to attribute it.

1:06:20.340 --> 1:06:22.660
 And the answer is they did something rotten

1:06:22.660 --> 1:06:23.940
 because they're rotten.

1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:25.760
 Always have been, always will be

1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:28.200
 this constitutional explanation.

1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:30.320
 You do something rotten to somebody

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:32.340
 and how do you explain it afterward?

1:06:32.340 --> 1:06:34.020
 A situational one.

1:06:34.020 --> 1:06:38.060
 I was tired, I was stressed in this sort of setting.

1:06:38.060 --> 1:06:40.220
 I misunderstood this.

1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:43.860
 We're best at excusing ourselves from bad things

1:06:43.860 --> 1:06:46.460
 because we have access to our inner lives.

1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:49.220
 And we've got prefrontal cortexes that are great

1:06:49.220 --> 1:06:52.300
 at coming up with a situational explanation

1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:54.700
 rather than, hey, maybe you're just like

1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:57.820
 a selfish rotten human and you need to change.

1:06:57.820 --> 1:06:59.980
 And that's all prefrontal cortex.

1:06:59.980 --> 1:07:04.620
 And we do that every time we don't let somebody,

1:07:04.620 --> 1:07:07.040
 you know, merge in the lane in front of us

1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:08.740
 even though you curse somebody

1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:13.740
 who does the same thing to you and, you know, endlessly.

1:07:14.660 --> 1:07:15.780
 Your, I love it.

1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:18.060
 Your statement about the fact

1:07:18.060 --> 1:07:21.140
 that we can select multiple hierarchies to participate in

1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:25.880
 to me seems like a particularly important one nowadays

1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:28.940
 with social media being so prevalent.

1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:31.300
 I know you're not particularly active on social media

1:07:31.300 --> 1:07:34.100
 although you might be pleasantly or I don't know

1:07:34.100 --> 1:07:35.380
 unpleasantly surprised to find out

1:07:35.380 --> 1:07:37.560
 that there's a lot of positive discussion

1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:38.880
 about you and your work.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.220
 So you don't even need to be on there.

1:07:40.220 --> 1:07:42.540
 We'll just continue to discuss your work.

1:07:42.540 --> 1:07:45.820
 But what's interesting about social media

1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:49.140
 I've found is that the context is very, very broad.

1:07:49.140 --> 1:07:52.140
 I mean, one could argue that who one selects to follow

1:07:52.140 --> 1:07:54.000
 and which news articles you're reading, et cetera,

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.200
 can create a kind of a funneling of information

1:07:56.200 --> 1:07:57.860
 that itself can be dangerous.

1:07:57.860 --> 1:08:01.220
 You know, more verification of crazy ideas

1:08:01.220 --> 1:08:04.280
 or even just less exposure to new ideas.

1:08:05.220 --> 1:08:07.100
 But there's also this idea

1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:11.060
 that social media is an incredibly broad context.

1:08:11.060 --> 1:08:13.020
 So as you scroll through a feed,

1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:15.780
 it's no longer like being in your eighth grade classroom

1:08:15.780 --> 1:08:18.580
 or your office or your faculty meeting.

1:08:18.580 --> 1:08:21.460
 You are being exposed to thousands

1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:23.900
 if not millions of contexts.

1:08:23.900 --> 1:08:27.200
 This meal, that soccer game, this person's body,

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.180
 this person's intellect.

1:08:29.180 --> 1:08:30.700
 YouTube is another example.

1:08:30.700 --> 1:08:34.060
 It's a vast, vast landscape.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.620
 So the context is completely mishmash.

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:41.020
 Whereas I'm assuming we evolved, I think we did evolve,

1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:43.460
 under contexts that were much more constrained.

1:08:43.460 --> 1:08:45.580
 We interacted with a limited number of individuals

1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:47.780
 and a limited number of different domains.

1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:50.380
 Seasons tend to constrain us all.

1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:53.060
 And of course, then we got phones and televisions

1:08:53.060 --> 1:08:54.140
 and this started to expand.

1:08:54.140 --> 1:08:56.820
 But now more than ever, our brain,

1:08:56.820 --> 1:09:00.140
 our prefrontal cortex and our sense of where we exist

1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:02.580
 in these multiple hierarchies

1:09:02.580 --> 1:09:06.620
 has essentially wicked out into infinity.

1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:08.700
 How do you think this might be interacting

1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:12.260
 with some of these more primitive systems

1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:15.960
 and other aspects of our biology?

1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:19.620
 Well, I think what you get is in some ways,

1:09:19.620 --> 1:09:24.540
 the punchline of what's most human about humans,

1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:28.620
 which is over and over, we use the exact same blueprint,

1:09:28.620 --> 1:09:33.100
 the same hormones, the same kinases, the same receptors,

1:09:33.100 --> 1:09:34.440
 the same everything.

1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:36.940
 We're built out of the exact same stuff

1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:39.020
 as all these other species out there.

1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:42.740
 And then we go and use it in a completely novel way.

1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:47.740
 And usually in terms of being able to abstract stuff

1:09:48.540 --> 1:09:51.780
 over space and time in dramatic ways.

1:09:51.780 --> 1:09:55.020
 So, okay, you're a low ranking baboon

1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:58.820
 and you can feel badly because you just like killed a rabbit

1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:01.140
 and you're about to eat and some higher ranking guy

1:10:01.140 --> 1:10:03.500
 boots you off and takes it away from you.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:07.740
 And you feel crummy and it's stressful and you're unhappy.

1:10:07.740 --> 1:10:12.460
 We are doing the exact same things with like our brain

1:10:12.460 --> 1:10:15.940
 and bodies when we're losing a sense of self-esteem,

1:10:15.940 --> 1:10:19.920
 but we can do it by watching a movie character on the screen

1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:23.540
 and feeling inadequate compared to like how wonderful

1:10:23.540 --> 1:10:25.060
 or attractive they are.

1:10:25.060 --> 1:10:29.460
 We can do it by somebody driving past us in an expensive car

1:10:29.460 --> 1:10:31.380
 and we don't even see their face.

1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:35.900
 And you can feel belittled by your own socioeconomic status.

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:40.980
 You can watch like the lifestyles of the rich and famous

1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:43.700
 or read about what Bezos is up to.

1:10:43.700 --> 1:10:47.560
 And for some reason decide your life is less fulfilling

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:50.700
 because you didn't fly into space for 11 minutes.

1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:54.320
 And so you can feel miserable about yourself

1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:58.020
 in ways that no other organism can simply

1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:03.020
 because we can have our meaningful social networks include

1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:05.960
 like the party you're reading about on Facebook

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:07.660
 that you weren't invited to

1:11:07.660 --> 1:11:09.460
 because it's taking place in Singapore

1:11:09.460 --> 1:11:10.860
 and you don't know any of those people.

1:11:10.860 --> 1:11:13.940
 But nonetheless, somehow that could be a means

1:11:13.940 --> 1:11:16.180
 for you to feel less content

1:11:16.180 --> 1:11:18.460
 with who you've turned out to be.

1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:20.500
 Do you take steps in your own life

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:25.260
 to actively restrict the context in which you think

1:11:25.260 --> 1:11:30.260
 and live and contemplate, you know,

1:11:30.740 --> 1:11:33.780
 in order to enhance your creative life,

1:11:33.780 --> 1:11:35.040
 your intellectual life,

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.600
 are those steps that you actively take?

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:43.640
 Well, I very actively don't know how to make use

1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:46.020
 of anything with social media.

1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:49.980
 So I guess that counts as my having thus actively chosen

1:11:49.980 --> 1:11:51.280
 not to learn how.

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:55.780
 So that's the case, certainly for the last year and a half,

1:11:55.780 --> 1:11:58.620
 like lots of people, I've gone through stretches

1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:01.820
 where I've managed to sort of enforce a moratorium

1:12:01.820 --> 1:12:05.420
 on looking at the news and that was wonderfully freeing.

1:12:06.260 --> 1:12:09.720
 I think in the larger sense though, you know,

1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:12.640
 in addition to me being a neurobiologist,

1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:15.440
 I sort of spent decades spending part of each year

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.980
 studying wild baboons out in a national park in East Africa.

1:12:19.980 --> 1:12:24.260
 And I'd spend three months a year without electricity,

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:28.420
 without phone calls, with, you know, going 12 hours a day

1:12:28.420 --> 1:12:30.540
 without saying a word to somebody.

1:12:30.540 --> 1:12:33.400
 And when I finally would, it would be somebody,

1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:37.280
 a nomadic pastoralist guy in a different language.

1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.100
 Yeah, I did 90% of my like insightful thinking

1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:44.200
 about anything in the laboratory

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:45.980
 during those three months each year

1:12:45.980 --> 1:12:50.100
 and not one in the lab and not one inundated with stuff.

1:12:50.100 --> 1:12:53.120
 Well, I think there's sort of a shifting trend

1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:55.940
 towards trying to create a narrowing of context

1:12:56.900 --> 1:12:59.180
 that people, and I like what I see.

1:12:59.180 --> 1:13:00.940
 I have a niece, she's 14 years old,

1:13:00.940 --> 1:13:02.500
 and she and her friends are very good

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.180
 at putting their phones away.

1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:06.180
 They say, we're not going to have our phones

1:13:06.180 --> 1:13:09.180
 for this interaction, especially after,

1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:11.740
 and I realize we're still somewhat in this,

1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:13.260
 it's unclear where it's headed,

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:15.540
 but at 2020 was so restrictive

1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:17.460
 and she was so separated from her friends.

1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:20.540
 Now it's let's really focus on being together

1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:23.340
 and not bring in all these other elements from our phones.

1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:27.380
 And that brings me great hope for that generation.

1:13:27.380 --> 1:13:29.980
 Maybe they will, you know, or who knows,

1:13:29.980 --> 1:13:31.580
 maybe they'll run off and study baboons.

1:13:31.580 --> 1:13:33.800
 We need more field researchers.

1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:36.860
 So along the lines of choice,

1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:41.020
 I'd like to shift gears slightly and talk about free will,

1:13:41.020 --> 1:13:43.720
 about our ability to make choices at all.

1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:48.860
 Well, my personal way out

1:13:48.860 --> 1:13:53.040
 and left field inflammatory stance is,

1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:55.480
 I don't think we have a shred of free will.

1:13:56.780 --> 1:14:01.780
 Despite, you know, 95% of philosophers

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:05.740
 and I think probably the majority of neuroscientists

1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:07.580
 saying that we have free will

1:14:07.580 --> 1:14:09.420
 in at least some circumstances,

1:14:09.420 --> 1:14:11.860
 I don't think there's any at all.

1:14:11.860 --> 1:14:16.860
 And the reason for this is you do something,

1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:20.480
 you behave, you make a choice, whatever.

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.500
 And to understand why you did that,

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.900
 where did that intention come from?

1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:30.420
 Part of it was due to like the sensory environment

1:14:30.420 --> 1:14:32.560
 you were in in the previous minute.

1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:34.380
 Some of it is from the hormone levels

1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:36.420
 in your bloodstream that morning.

1:14:36.420 --> 1:14:40.340
 Some of it is from whether you had a wonderful

1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:42.000
 or stressful last three months

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.460
 and what sort of neuroplasticity happened.

1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:46.580
 Part of it is what hormone levels

1:14:46.580 --> 1:14:48.980
 you were exposed to as a fetus.

1:14:48.980 --> 1:14:52.700
 Part of it is what culture your ancestors came up with

1:14:52.700 --> 1:14:56.220
 and thus how you were parented when you were a kid.

1:14:56.220 --> 1:14:57.920
 All of those are in there

1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:00.660
 and you can't understand where behavior is coming from

1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:02.480
 without incorporating all of those.

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:07.480
 And at that point, not only are there

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:11.860
 all of these relevant factors,

1:15:11.860 --> 1:15:15.120
 but they're ultimately all one factor.

1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:17.280
 If you're talking about what evolution

1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:19.080
 has to do with your behavior,

1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:22.200
 by definition, you're also talking about genetics.

1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:23.960
 If you're talking about what your genes

1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:25.520
 have to do with behavior,

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.320
 by definition, you're talking about

1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:29.120
 how your brain was constructed

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:31.280
 or what proteins are coded for.

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:35.800
 If you're talking about like your mood disorder now,

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:37.960
 you're talking about the sense of efficacy

1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:39.760
 you were getting as a five-year-old.

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:41.040
 They're all intertwined.

1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:45.220
 And when you look at all those influences,

1:15:45.220 --> 1:15:50.220
 basically like the challenge is show me a neuron

1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.380
 that just caused that behavior

1:15:52.380 --> 1:15:54.140
 or show me a network of neurons

1:15:54.140 --> 1:15:56.040
 that just caused that behavior

1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:59.940
 and show me that nothing about what they just did

1:15:59.940 --> 1:16:04.040
 was influenced by anything from the sensory environment

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:07.160
 one second ago to the evolution of your species.

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:09.800
 And there's no space in there

1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:13.040
 to fit in a free will concept

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:18.040
 that winds up being in your brain, but not of your brain.

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:21.960
 There's simply no wiggle room for it there.

1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:26.240
 So I can appreciate that our behaviors and our choices

1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:29.100
 are the consequence of a long line of dominoes

1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:32.360
 that fell prior to that behavior.

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:36.280
 But is it possible that I can intervene

1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:40.120
 in the domino effect, so to speak?

1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:44.520
 In other words, can my recognition of the fact

1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:46.800
 that genes have heritability,

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:50.780
 there's an epigenome that there's a hormonal context,

1:16:50.780 --> 1:16:52.960
 there's a historical context,

1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:58.080
 can the knowledge of that give me some small,

1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:00.460
 small shard of free will?

1:17:00.460 --> 1:17:03.000
 Meaning does it allow me to say, ah, okay,

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.160
 I accept that my choices are somewhat predetermined

1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:10.000
 and yet knowing that gives me

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.920
 some additional layer of control.

1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:17.360
 Is there any philosophical or biological universe

1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:19.620
 in which that works?

1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:21.400
 Yeah.

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:26.380
 So all of that can produce

1:17:26.380 --> 1:17:30.920
 the wonderfully positive belief that change can happen.

1:17:31.820 --> 1:17:34.600
 Even dramatic change, even in the worst of circumstances,

1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:37.620
 most unlikely people, and change can happen.

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:39.820
 Things can change.

1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:42.080
 Don't be fatalistic, don't decide

1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:45.340
 because we're mechanistic biological machines

1:17:45.340 --> 1:17:48.380
 that nothing can ever, change can happen.

1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:51.940
 But where people go off the rails

1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:57.820
 is translating that into, we can change ourselves.

1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:02.460
 We don't, we can't, because there's no free will.

1:18:02.460 --> 1:18:07.060
 However, we can be changed by circumstance.

1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:10.700
 And the point of it is,

1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:15.500
 like you look at an aplasia, a sea slug

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:18.760
 that has learned to retract its gill in response

1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:22.640
 to a shock on its tail, you can do like conditioning,

1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:26.220
 Pavlovian conditioning on it, and it has learned

1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:30.100
 its behavior has been changed by its environment.

1:18:30.100 --> 1:18:32.620
 And you hear news about something

1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:35.740
 like horrifically depressing going on

1:18:35.740 --> 1:18:40.740
 and, you know, refugees in wherever.

1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:45.740
 And as a result, you feel a little bit more helpless

1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:48.900
 and a less of a sense of efficacy in the world.

1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:53.240
 And both of your behaviors have been changed.

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:55.160
 Okay, okay, yeah, I guess that's good.

1:18:55.160 --> 1:19:00.160
 But the remarkable thing is it's the exact same neurobiology.

1:19:00.380 --> 1:19:04.380
 The signal transduction pathways that were happening

1:19:04.380 --> 1:19:09.380
 in that sea snail incorporate the exact same kinases

1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:13.300
 and proteases and phosphatases that we do

1:19:13.300 --> 1:19:16.180
 when you're having mammalian fear conditioning

1:19:16.180 --> 1:19:20.060
 or when you're learning, it's conserved,

1:19:20.060 --> 1:19:21.940
 it's the exact same thing.

1:19:21.940 --> 1:19:23.100
 It's simply playing out

1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:26.140
 in obviously a much, much fancier domain.

1:19:26.140 --> 1:19:31.140
 And because you have learned that change is possible

1:19:34.260 --> 1:19:36.280
 despite understanding mechanistically

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:39.660
 that we can't change ourselves volitionally,

1:19:39.660 --> 1:19:42.340
 but because you understand change is possible,

1:19:42.340 --> 1:19:45.980
 you have just changed the ability of your brain

1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:49.580
 to respond to optimistic stimuli.

1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:52.120
 And you have changed the ability of your brain

1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:54.300
 to now send you in the direction

1:19:54.300 --> 1:19:56.380
 of being exposed to more information

1:19:56.380 --> 1:19:59.140
 that will seem cheerful rather than depressing.

1:19:59.140 --> 1:20:02.900
 Oh my God, that's amazing what Nelson Mandela

1:20:02.900 --> 1:20:05.900
 and Martin Luther King and all these folks did.

1:20:05.900 --> 1:20:08.460
 Wow, under the most adverse of circumstances,

1:20:08.460 --> 1:20:12.140
 they were able to do, maybe I can also.

1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:15.140
 Maybe I can go read more about people like them

1:20:15.140 --> 1:20:20.140
 to get even more data points of change to neurochemistry

1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:23.500
 so that your responses are different now.

1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:27.660
 And you're tilted a little bit more in that direction

1:20:27.660 --> 1:20:29.620
 of feeling like you can make a difference

1:20:29.620 --> 1:20:32.320
 instead of it's all damn hopeless.

1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:34.440
 So enormous change can happen,

1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:37.040
 but the last thing that could come out of a view

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:41.620
 of we are nothing more or less than the sum of our biology

1:20:41.620 --> 1:20:43.620
 and its interactions with environment

1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:45.380
 is to throw up your hands and say,

1:20:45.380 --> 1:20:48.580
 and thus it's no use trying to change anything.

1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:51.940
 So we can acknowledge that change

1:20:51.940 --> 1:20:54.600
 is extremely hard to impossible,

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:56.340
 that circumstances can change,

1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:59.800
 and yet that striving to be better human beings

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:01.560
 is still a worthwhile endeavor.

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.880
 Do I have that correct?

1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:06.940
 Absolutely, because simply the knowledge

1:21:06.940 --> 1:21:09.860
 either from experience or making it to the end

1:21:09.860 --> 1:21:14.000
 of the right neurobiology class has taught you

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.940
 that change can happen within a framework

1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:19.660
 of a mechanistic neurobiology.

1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:23.860
 You were now more open to being made optimistic

1:21:23.860 --> 1:21:26.060
 by the good news in the world around you.

1:21:26.060 --> 1:21:28.680
 You were more likely to be inspired by this or that.

1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:32.500
 You were more resistant to getting discouraged by bad news.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:36.060
 Simply because you now understand it's possible.

1:21:37.380 --> 1:21:39.700
 Yeah, somebody who spent much of his career

1:21:39.700 --> 1:21:40.860
 working on the hippocampus,

1:21:40.860 --> 1:21:43.940
 I have to assume that you are a believer in neuroplasticity,

1:21:43.940 --> 1:21:46.780
 that neural circuits can change in response to experience

1:21:46.780 --> 1:21:49.780
 and that some of the same so-called top-down mechanisms

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:52.940
 of prefrontal cortex that we were talking about before

1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:54.060
 can play a role there,

1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:56.020
 that the decision to try and change

1:21:56.020 --> 1:21:59.500
 and the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of experience

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:01.020
 can shape our circuitry

1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:05.060
 and therefore make us different machines, so to speak.

1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:10.060
 Yeah, and not only can say prenatal hormone exposure

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:14.100
 change the way your brain is being constructed,

1:22:14.100 --> 1:22:17.300
 but learning that prenatal hormone exposure

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:19.540
 can change the construction of your brain

1:22:19.540 --> 1:22:21.940
 will change your brain right now

1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:26.180
 and how you think about where your intentions came from.

1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:29.080
 Wow, maybe that had something to do with it.

1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:31.620
 The knowledge of the knowledge

1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:34.420
 is an effector in and of itself.

1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:38.860
 That's such an important and powerful statement to hear.

1:22:38.860 --> 1:22:42.580
 I think that many people think that if a tool,

1:22:42.580 --> 1:22:47.580
 it doesn't involve a pill or a protocol,

1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:49.840
 that it's useless.

1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:51.580
 And certainly there are pills and protocols

1:22:51.580 --> 1:22:53.660
 that are very useful in a variety of contexts

1:22:53.660 --> 1:22:55.340
 for a variety of things.

1:22:55.340 --> 1:22:57.900
 But the idea that knowledge itself,

1:22:57.900 --> 1:23:01.620
 or as you put it, knowledge of knowledge is itself a tool,

1:23:01.620 --> 1:23:04.100
 I think is a very important concept

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:07.060
 for people to embed in their minds.

1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:11.040
 And listen, I'm so grateful for this discussion

1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:13.120
 and for you raising these topics.

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.140
 I think that many people know your work

1:23:17.140 --> 1:23:18.720
 on testosterone, on stress,

1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:19.900
 and we've covered some of that today.

1:23:19.900 --> 1:23:23.780
 The work on free will and this idea that we are hopeless

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:27.060
 or that we are in total control,

1:23:27.060 --> 1:23:30.220
 I think I'm realizing and listening to you

1:23:30.220 --> 1:23:35.220
 that neither is true and that the solution resides

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:39.700
 in understanding more about free will and lack of it

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:42.980
 and also neuroplasticity.

1:23:43.900 --> 1:23:47.260
 You're working on a book about free will.

1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:49.820
 Are you willing to tell us a little bit about that book

1:23:49.820 --> 1:23:51.280
 and where you are in that process

1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:52.900
 and what we can look forward to?

1:23:52.900 --> 1:23:57.420
 Yeah, it's going really slow.

1:23:57.420 --> 1:24:02.420
 Title is Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will.

1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:05.640
 And essentially the first half of the book

1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:08.920
 is trying to convince a reader,

1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:11.760
 okay, if not that there's no free will whatsoever,

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:15.360
 but at least there's a lot less than is normally assumed.

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:18.660
 And I'm going through all the standard arguments

1:24:18.660 --> 1:24:22.140
 for free will and why that doesn't make sense

1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:24.420
 with 21st century science.

1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:28.260
 And that has led to reading a lot

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:31.320
 of very frustrating philosophers

1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:35.020
 who basically are willing to admit

1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:39.040
 that stuff is made out of like atoms and molecules

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:42.100
 and like there's a physical reality to the world.

1:24:42.100 --> 1:24:44.200
 They're not just relying on magic,

1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:48.180
 but that they believe in free will for magical reasons

1:24:48.180 --> 1:24:50.100
 and where it doesn't make sense.

1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:52.300
 Okay, so the first half of the book is

1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:54.240
 to hopefully convince people

1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:57.020
 that there's much less free will than they used to think.

1:24:57.020 --> 1:24:59.940
 And then the second half is this gigantic juncture

1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:01.940
 built around the fact that I haven't thought

1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:06.060
 there's any free will since I was like an adolescent.

1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:08.260
 And despite thinking that way,

1:25:08.260 --> 1:25:10.500
 I still have absolutely no idea

1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:14.500
 how you're supposed to function with that belief.

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:18.140
 How are you supposed to like go about everyday life

1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:23.140
 if anything you feel entitled to isn't true,

1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:26.640
 if any angers and hatreds you feel aren't justified,

1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:29.520
 if there's no such thing as appropriate,

1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:31.940
 blame or punishment or praise or reward,

1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:33.880
 and none of it makes any sense.

1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:37.220
 And somebody like even compliments you on your haircut

1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:39.520
 and you've been conditioned to like say,

1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:43.160
 oh, thanks as if you had something to do.

1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:45.260
 How are we supposed to function with that?

1:25:45.260 --> 1:25:50.260
 And so the second half is wrestling with that.

1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:55.940
 And what the punchline there is,

1:25:55.940 --> 1:25:59.080
 is it's gonna be incredibly hard.

1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:00.820
 And if you think it's gonna be hard

1:26:00.820 --> 1:26:03.680
 to subtract a notion of free will

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:07.460
 out of making sense of like serial murderers,

1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:09.380
 it's gonna be a thousand times harder

1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:14.220
 of making sense of when somebody says good job to you.

1:26:14.220 --> 1:26:18.960
 And because it's the exact same unreality

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:21.360
 of sort of our interpretations,

1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:23.640
 it's gonna be incredibly hard.

1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:27.480
 But nonetheless, when you look at the history

1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:32.480
 of how we have subtracted the notion of agency

1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:35.680
 out of all sorts of realms of blame,

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:38.320
 starting with thinking that witches

1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:41.460
 caused hailstorms 500 years ago

1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:45.460
 to the notion that psychodynamically screwed up mothers

1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:49.400
 caused schizophrenia, we've done it.

1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:51.600
 We've done it endless number of times.

1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:54.700
 We've been able to subtract out a sense of volition

1:26:54.700 --> 1:26:57.700
 in understanding how the world works around us.

1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:00.940
 And we don't have murderers running amok on the street

1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:04.440
 and society hasn't collapsed into a puddle.

1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:07.140
 And in fact, it's a more humane society.

1:27:07.140 --> 1:27:11.480
 So the good news is it's possible

1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:14.680
 because we've done it repeatedly in the past,

1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:16.720
 but it's gonna be hard as hell.

1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.320
 And it's hard as hell to try to write about that coherently

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:23.720
 on discovery and so it's going slowly.

1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:26.440
 Well, I speak for many, many people

1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:29.740
 when I say that we're really excited

1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:33.880
 for the book when it's done and we will patiently wait,

1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:37.440
 but with great excitement for the book, Determined,

1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:38.880
 you said is the title, correct?

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:43.000
 Yeah, Determined for the Science of Life Without Free Will.

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.960
 Seems like you can't publish your book these days

1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:48.640
 without a subtitle, so that's it.

1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:49.760
 Fantastic.

1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:52.320
 Well, very excited to read the book.

1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:54.760
 Very grateful to you for this conversation today.

1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:56.600
 I learned a ton.

1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:58.080
 Every time you speak, I learn.

1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:00.000
 And for me, it's really been a pleasure

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.440
 and a delight to interact with you today

1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:07.040
 and over the previous years, I should say as colleagues.

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:10.840
 And thank you again, Robert, for everything that you do

1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:12.720
 and all the hard, hard work and thinking

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:13.740
 that you put into your work,

1:28:13.740 --> 1:28:16.780
 because it's clear that you put a lot of hard work

1:28:16.780 --> 1:28:21.100
 and thinking and we all benefit as a consequence.

1:28:21.100 --> 1:28:24.000
 Thanks and thanks for having me.

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.220
 This was a blast.

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:28.520
 Thank you for joining me for my conversation

1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:30.500

1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:53.380
 that we mentioned at the beginning of this podcast.

1:28:53.380 --> 1:28:55.160
 That's a terrific way to support us.

1:28:55.160 --> 1:28:56.420
 And for those of you that are interested

1:28:56.420 --> 1:28:59.120
 in supporting research on stress, on sleep,

1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:02.760
 and how to better access sleep and combat stress,

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.080
 you can do that by supporting the research being done

1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:07.080
 on those topics in my laboratory.

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:10.120
 You can go to Hubermanlab.stanford.edu

1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:13.520
 and there you'll see a tab entitled support research

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:14.480
 in the Huberman Lab.

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:17.100
 So that's for work at the Huberman Lab at Stanford,

1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:18.800
 not the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:20.300
 And there's a make a donation tab

1:29:20.300 --> 1:29:22.560
 where you can make a tax deductible donation.

1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:24.600
 And if you're not already following the Huberman Lab

1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:27.000
 on Instagram, please check out Huberman Lab

1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.220
 on Instagram and on Twitter.

1:29:29.220 --> 1:29:32.480
 On both those channels, I post information about science

1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:35.760
 and science-related tools anywhere from one to five minutes.

1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:37.900
 Some of that information overlaps with the podcast,

1:29:37.900 --> 1:29:39.380
 but a lot of it is unique and different

1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:41.360
 from the information on this podcast.

1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:43.200
 And last but not least,

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:45.000
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:58.000
 And I'll see you in the next one.
