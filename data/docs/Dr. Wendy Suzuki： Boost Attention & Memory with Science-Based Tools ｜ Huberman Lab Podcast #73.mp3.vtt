00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.620
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.620 --> 00:14.740
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.740 --> 00:17.280
 Today, my guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.100
 Dr. Suzuki is a professor of neuroscience and psychology

00:20.100 --> 00:23.100
 at New York University, and one of the leading researchers

00:23.100 --> 00:25.380
 in the area of learning and memory.

00:25.380 --> 00:27.540
 Her laboratory has contributed fundamental

00:27.540 --> 00:29.980
 textbook understanding of how brain areas,

00:29.980 --> 00:32.940
 such as the hippocampus, which you will learn about today,

00:32.940 --> 00:36.440
 how the hippocampus and related brain circuits allow us

00:36.440 --> 00:39.180
 to take certain experiences and commit them to memory

00:39.180 --> 00:41.740
 so that we can use that information in the future.

00:41.740 --> 00:45.060
 Dr. Suzuki is also an expert public educator

00:45.060 --> 00:46.660
 in the realm of science.

00:46.660 --> 00:49.220
 A few years back, she had a TED Talk

00:49.220 --> 00:50.740
 that essentially went viral.

00:50.740 --> 00:51.860
 If you haven't seen it already,

00:51.860 --> 00:53.680
 you should absolutely check it out.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.820
 In which she describes her experience using exercise

00:57.820 --> 01:00.260
 as a way to enhance learning and memory.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.640
 And on the basis of that personal experience,

01:02.640 --> 01:05.620
 she reshaped her laboratory to explore how things

01:05.620 --> 01:09.160
 like meditation, exercise, and other things that we can do

01:09.160 --> 01:12.100
 with our physiology and our psychology can allow us

01:12.100 --> 01:15.700
 to learn faster, to commit things to memory longer,

01:15.700 --> 01:18.440
 and indeed to reshape our cognitive performance

01:18.440 --> 01:20.360
 in a variety of settings.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.300
 As such, I am delighted to announce

01:22.300 --> 01:25.460
 that Dr. Suzuki is now not only running a laboratory

01:25.460 --> 01:28.300
 at New York University, but she is the incoming Dean

01:28.300 --> 01:30.860
 of Arts and Science at New York University.

01:30.860 --> 01:32.660
 And of course, she was selected for that role

01:32.660 --> 01:35.980
 for her many talents, but one of the important aspects

01:35.980 --> 01:38.460
 of her program, she tells me, is going to be

01:38.460 --> 01:42.140
 to incorporate the incredible power of exercise,

01:42.140 --> 01:44.540
 meditation, and other behavioral practices

01:44.540 --> 01:48.260
 for enhancing learning, for improving stress management,

01:48.260 --> 01:50.740
 and other things to optimize student performance.

01:50.740 --> 01:52.660
 Today, you are going to get access

01:52.660 --> 01:55.140
 to much of that information so that you can apply

01:55.140 --> 01:58.060
 those tools in your daily life as well.

01:58.060 --> 02:01.900
 Dr. Suzuki is also an author of several important books.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.260
 The most recent one is entitled Good Anxiety,

02:04.260 --> 02:07.620
 Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion,

02:07.620 --> 02:10.300
 and a previous book entitled Healthy Brain, Happy Life,

02:10.300 --> 02:12.300
 A Personal Program to Activate Your Brain

02:12.300 --> 02:14.100
 and Do Everything Better.

02:14.100 --> 02:18.560
 And while that is admittedly a very pop science type title,

02:18.560 --> 02:21.380
 I will remind you that she is one of the preeminent

02:21.380 --> 02:23.540
 memory researchers in the world

02:23.540 --> 02:25.980
 and has been for quite a while.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.540
 So the information that you'll glean from those books

02:28.540 --> 02:32.140
 is both rich in depth and breadth and is highly applicable.

02:32.140 --> 02:33.760
 By the end of today's discussion,

02:33.760 --> 02:36.020
 you will have learned from Dr. Suzuki

02:36.020 --> 02:38.960
 a large amount of knowledge about how memories are formed,

02:38.960 --> 02:42.340
 how they are lost, and you will have a much larger kit

02:42.340 --> 02:46.180
 of tools to apply for your efforts to learn better,

02:46.180 --> 02:48.580
 to remember better, and to apply that information

02:48.580 --> 02:50.420
 in the ways that best serve you.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.940
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:52.940 --> 02:55.860
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.040
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:58.040 --> 03:00.500
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:00.500 --> 03:03.340
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:03.340 --> 03:04.380
 In keeping with that theme,

03:04.380 --> 03:07.160
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.380
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

03:09.380 --> 03:10.980
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:10.980 --> 03:13.420
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.140
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

03:16.140 --> 03:18.580
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.460
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

03:20.460 --> 03:22.000
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

03:22.000 --> 03:24.260
 once or twice a day is that it meets

03:24.260 --> 03:27.660
 all my foundational vitamin mineral and probiotic needs.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.740
 In fact, whenever people ask me

03:29.740 --> 03:31.540
 if I were to only take one supplement,

03:31.540 --> 03:32.820
 which supplement should I take?

03:32.820 --> 03:35.460
 I tell them Athletic Greens for the simple reason

03:35.460 --> 03:37.140
 that it covers your base of vitamins,

03:37.140 --> 03:38.640
 minerals, and probiotics.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.500
 It also has important adaptogens,

03:40.500 --> 03:42.740
 digestive enzymes for gut health.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.300
 All of this is very important because we now know

03:45.300 --> 03:48.860
 that gut health and the so-called gut-brain axis

03:48.860 --> 03:52.100
 is very important for things like mood and brain function,

03:52.100 --> 03:54.940
 and also contributes to immune system function.

03:54.940 --> 03:57.900
 With Athletic Greens, you're covering all those bases,

03:57.900 --> 04:00.060
 and of course, you need to eat a nutrition

04:00.060 --> 04:01.940
 and healthy diet that's right for you.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.080
 But by taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day,

04:04.080 --> 04:05.760
 you can be sure that there are going to be no gaps

04:05.760 --> 04:07.820
 or deficiencies in your vitamin, mineral,

04:07.820 --> 04:09.900
 or probiotic needs.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.940
 I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice

04:11.940 --> 04:14.780
 or lime juice, and I personally find it delicious.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.100
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

04:16.100 --> 04:19.040
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:19.040 --> 04:20.220

04:20.220 --> 04:21.980
 They'll give you five free travel packs

04:21.980 --> 04:24.980
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,

04:24.980 --> 04:26.380
 both of which are also vital

04:26.380 --> 04:28.300
 for immediate and long-term health.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.500
 So once again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:31.500 --> 04:34.420
 you can get a special offer of five free travel packs

04:34.420 --> 04:36.340
 to make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

04:36.340 --> 04:38.780
 while you're in the car or otherwise traveling.

04:38.780 --> 04:42.180
 Plus, they'll give you the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:42.180 --> 04:44.980
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.540
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:47.540 --> 04:50.100
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:50.100 --> 04:51.700
 to help you better understand your body

04:51.700 --> 04:53.880
 and help you reach your health goals.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.820
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

04:56.820 --> 04:59.100
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

04:59.100 --> 05:01.380
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

05:01.380 --> 05:03.960
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.760
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

05:06.760 --> 05:08.820
 you can also get insight into, for instance,

05:08.820 --> 05:10.300
 what your biological age is

05:10.300 --> 05:11.960
 and compare that to your chronological age.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.500
 And of course, your biological age

05:13.500 --> 05:16.260
 is the number that really matters.

05:16.260 --> 05:18.720
 With Inside Tracker, there's a distinct advantage.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.140
 And the advantage is that while there are many blood tests

05:21.140 --> 05:22.180
 and DNA tests out there,

05:22.180 --> 05:24.540
 Inside Tracker's blood and DNA tests

05:24.540 --> 05:28.460
 come also with a platform, meaning a website platform

05:28.460 --> 05:32.340
 that allows you to see exactly what you could or should do

05:32.340 --> 05:35.700
 in order to adjust the numbers on things like hormone levels,

05:35.700 --> 05:38.180
 metabolic factors, and lipids, and so on.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.340
 It's a little pop-up window.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.860
 It points to nutritional, supplementation,

05:41.860 --> 05:43.620
 and behavioral regimens that you can take

05:43.620 --> 05:45.540
 in order to put those numbers in the ranges

05:45.540 --> 05:46.940
 that are optimal for you.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.420
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:48.420 --> 05:51.260
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:51.260 --> 05:54.060
 to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

05:54.060 --> 05:57.900
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.540
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.660
 Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books,

06:03.660 --> 06:05.580
 each condensed down to just 15 minutes

06:05.580 --> 06:07.780
 of key takeaways for those books.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.160
 I love reading books from front to back.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.580
 I like the actual physical book.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.940
 I'm sort of old fashioned in that way.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.100
 And I do also listen to audio books.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.480
 It's very rare that I don't finish a book that I've started.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.020
 Nonetheless, I like to revisit some of my favorite books.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.260
 I also like to write down key takeaways from those books,

06:23.260 --> 06:26.620
 sometimes even before I listen to the full length book.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.980
 So I don't mind spoiling the takeaways

06:28.980 --> 06:30.120
 because when I read nonfiction,

06:30.120 --> 06:31.380
 generally I'm trying to extract

06:31.380 --> 06:33.260
 the most valuable knowledge from them.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.180
 So I often listen to a Blinkist 15 minute version,

06:36.180 --> 06:39.480
 then the full length book, or sometimes the full length book

06:39.480 --> 06:41.500
 and then the Blinkist 15 minute version,

06:41.500 --> 06:44.500
 either way, Blinkist is a great way to get through any book

06:44.500 --> 06:46.920
 and to extract the best from those books.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.960
 I've used it for, for instance, Matt Walker's,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.980
 Why We Sleep, an excellent book on why we sleep,

06:51.980 --> 06:55.020
 as well as Tim Ferriss's, The Four Hour Body,

06:55.020 --> 06:59.100
 Nassim Taleb's, The Black Swan, and so on and so on.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.580
 With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to read or listen

07:01.580 --> 07:04.180
 to a massive library of nonfiction books.

07:04.180 --> 07:06.540
 It really is a treasure trove of information.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.120
 Right now, Blinkist has a special offer

07:08.120 --> 07:10.020
 just for Huberman Lab podcast listeners.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.540
 If you go to blinkist.com slash Huberman,

07:12.540 --> 07:14.660
 you can get a free seven day trial

07:14.660 --> 07:18.120
 and 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.060
 Once again, go to blinkist.com slash Huberman

07:21.060 --> 07:24.260
 to get a seven day free trial and 25% off.

07:24.260 --> 07:27.980
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Wendy Suzuki.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.340
 Wendy, great to see you again and to have you here.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.560
 It's been a little while.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.620
 It's been a while.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.940
 So great to be here, Andrew.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.260
 Thank you so much for having me.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.160
 Yeah, delighted.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.840
 I'd like to start off by talking about memory generally.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.780
 And then I'd love to chat about your incredible work,

07:44.780 --> 07:48.000
 discovering how exercise and memory interface

07:48.000 --> 07:49.960
 and what people can do to improve their memory

07:49.960 --> 07:51.840
 and brain function generally.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.000
 But for those that are not familiar,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.460
 maybe you could just step us through

07:56.460 --> 07:58.880
 the basic elements of memory.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.200
 A few brain structures, perhaps.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.640
 What happens when I, for instance,

08:02.640 --> 08:07.200
 this mug of tea is pretty unremarkable,

08:07.200 --> 08:09.700
 but the fact that now I've talked about it,

08:09.700 --> 08:11.680
 I don't know that I'll ever forget about it.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.960
 Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.740
 So what happens when I look at this mug

08:15.740 --> 08:19.920
 and decide that it's something special for whatever reason?

08:19.920 --> 08:22.860
 Yeah, well, I like to see there are four things

08:22.860 --> 08:25.040
 that make things memorable.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.040
 Number one is novelty.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.920
 If it's something new, the very first thing,

08:30.920 --> 08:32.720
 the very first time we've seen something

08:32.720 --> 08:35.640
 or experienced something, our brains are drawn to that.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.920
 Our attentional systems draw us to that.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.020
 And when you are paying attention to something,

08:40.020 --> 08:43.480
 that's part of what makes things memorable.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.220
 Second is repetition.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.440
 If you see that cup of tea every single day

08:48.440 --> 08:50.320
 and every single time you do an interview,

08:50.320 --> 08:52.480
 you talk about your cup of tea, you're gonna remember it.

08:52.480 --> 08:57.120
 That's just how our brains work, repetition works.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.800
 Third is association.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.200
 So if you meet somebody new

09:04.200 --> 09:07.040
 that knows lots of people that you know,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.980
 so you and I share many, many, many, many people

09:09.980 --> 09:12.760
 that we both know, it's easy to remember,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.440
 it's easier to remember you,

09:14.440 --> 09:16.220
 especially if you were somebody new

09:16.220 --> 09:18.680
 that I hadn't met before, we have met before.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.100
 So association.

09:21.140 --> 09:24.720
 And then the fourth one is emotional resonance.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.240
 So we remember the happiest and the saddest moments

09:28.240 --> 09:31.680
 of our lives, and that also includes funny,

09:31.680 --> 09:35.160
 surprising things, that is the interaction

09:35.160 --> 09:39.840
 between two key brain structures, the amygdala,

09:39.840 --> 09:43.960
 which is important for processing lots of emotional,

09:43.960 --> 09:46.300
 particularly threatening kinds of situations.

09:46.300 --> 09:50.340
 But those threatening, surprising kinds of situations,

09:50.340 --> 09:52.120
 the amygdala takes that information

09:52.120 --> 09:56.600
 and makes another key structure called the hippocampus

09:56.600 --> 10:01.600
 work better to put new long-term memories in your brain.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.600
 So that, in fact, is the key structure for long-term memory,

10:06.600 --> 10:08.960
 the structure called the hippocampus.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.760
 Fantastic, so novelty, repetition, association,

10:11.760 --> 10:13.160
 and emotional resonance.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.160
 Yes.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.120
 You can tell us a bit more about the hippocampus.

10:16.120 --> 10:19.200
 I think, at least for my generation,

10:19.200 --> 10:20.140
 well, I'm a neuroscientist,

10:20.140 --> 10:21.680
 but for most people in my generation,

10:21.680 --> 10:23.600
 I think they first heard about the hippocampus

10:23.600 --> 10:24.880
 from the movie Memento.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.720
 Oh, yeah.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.080
 That guy says hippocampus.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.120
 Yeah.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.760
 And for those of you that haven't seen that movie,

10:29.760 --> 10:32.120
 it's a bizarrely constructed movie,

10:32.120 --> 10:36.160
 but an interesting one, nonetheless, about memory.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.280
 But even as a neuroscientist,

10:38.280 --> 10:43.280
 sometimes I'm perplexed at how the hippocampus works.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.400
 Maybe you could, if you would, step us through

10:47.400 --> 10:49.700
 what this structure is, what it looks like,

10:49.700 --> 10:51.320
 maybe a few of its sub-regions,

10:51.320 --> 10:55.760
 because unlike vision, the topic that I've worked

10:55.760 --> 10:58.200
 most of my career on, where we know,

10:58.200 --> 10:59.480
 okay, the eye does this part,

10:59.480 --> 11:00.320
 and the thalamus does this part,

11:00.320 --> 11:01.860
 and the cortex does that part,

11:01.860 --> 11:03.020
 I've always been a little perplexed

11:03.020 --> 11:04.560
 about the hippocampus, frankly.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.500
 Okay.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.400
 And I've read the textbooks, and I've heard the lectures,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.160
 but I'd love to get the update.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.180
 What are the general themes of the hippocampus

11:11.180 --> 11:13.840
 as a structure and its function?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.560
 What do you think everyone, including neuroscientists,

11:16.560 --> 11:18.040
 should know about the hippocampus?

11:18.040 --> 11:21.220
 Absolutely, so let's start with the basics.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.200
 The word hippocampus means seahorse.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.240
 It is shaped, the structure is shaped

11:26.240 --> 11:30.520
 like a kind of curly-Q seahorse, that is accurate.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.720
 Everybody, including neuroscientists,

11:33.720 --> 11:35.160
 should know it's a beautiful structure.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.880
 It is visually anatomically beautiful

11:38.880 --> 11:42.200
 with these kind of intertwining,

11:42.200 --> 11:45.560
 twirly sub-regions within it.

11:45.560 --> 11:49.100
 And I think that's one of the reasons why early anatomists,

11:49.100 --> 11:50.940
 who were the very first neuroscientists,

11:50.940 --> 11:51.940
 got attracted to it,

11:51.940 --> 11:54.920
 because it's this interesting kind of twirly structure

11:54.920 --> 11:56.980
 deep in the heart of the brain.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.800
 So that's anatomically.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.600
 Functionally, what does it do?

12:01.600 --> 12:05.840
 Well, it's easiest to understand what it does

12:05.840 --> 12:08.680
 when you look at what happens

12:08.680 --> 12:10.560
 when you don't have a hippocampus anymore.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.200
 What if you, what if by some disease

12:14.200 --> 12:18.300
 or you have your hippocampus removed by accident,

12:18.300 --> 12:19.260
 what happens?

12:19.260 --> 12:23.000
 Well, we know this from the most famous

12:23.000 --> 12:26.160
 neurological patient of all time.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.000
 His initials were H.M.,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.640
 so all psychology and neuroscience students know him.

12:32.640 --> 12:37.040
 He was operated in 1954,

12:37.040 --> 12:40.560
 and the paper was published in 1957.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.760
 They removed both his hippocampi

12:42.760 --> 12:45.680
 because he had very terrible epilepsy.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.000
 And they knew that the hippocampus

12:48.000 --> 12:50.280
 was the genesis of epilepsy,

12:50.280 --> 12:51.700
 and this was experimental.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.900
 His epilepsy was so bad that they decided

12:54.900 --> 12:57.840
 not just to remove one hippocampus, but both.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.200
 And what happened was immediate,

13:01.740 --> 13:06.320
 immediate loss of all ability to form new memories

13:06.320 --> 13:07.840
 for facts and events.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.980
 Think about that for a second.

13:09.980 --> 13:13.480
 All facts or events you're not able to remember.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.620
 I can't remember this interaction between us.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.360
 I can't remember any of the facts

13:18.360 --> 13:22.420
 that we were just chatting about in our neuroscience lives.

13:22.420 --> 13:27.420
 None of that can move into our long-term memory.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.920
 So this hippocampus does something

13:29.920 --> 13:32.920
 with all of these perceptions that are coming at us

13:32.920 --> 13:35.360
 every single day, every minute of the day,

13:35.360 --> 13:37.480
 and not for all of them,

13:37.480 --> 13:39.760
 but for some of them that have these features

13:39.760 --> 13:40.880
 that we just talked about.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.880
 Maybe they're novel, maybe they have associations,

13:42.880 --> 13:44.580
 maybe they're emotionally relevant,

13:44.580 --> 13:48.160
 maybe they've been repeated.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.520
 Some of those things in the realm of facts or events

13:51.520 --> 13:55.800
 get encoded in our long-term memory.

13:55.800 --> 14:00.040
 And that's the textbook of why the hippocampus

14:00.040 --> 14:01.320
 is so important.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.400
 I like to always add, and I mean,

14:03.400 --> 14:06.400
 this is why I studied it for so many years,

14:06.400 --> 14:09.440
 the hippocampus and what it does really defines

14:09.440 --> 14:11.360
 our own personal histories.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.660
 It means it defines who we are,

14:13.660 --> 14:16.920
 because if we can't remember what we've done,

14:16.920 --> 14:19.100
 the information we've learned,

14:19.100 --> 14:22.560
 and the events of our lives, it changes us.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.640
 That's what really defines us.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.560
 That's why I wanted to study the hippocampus.

14:27.560 --> 14:32.560
 And I think the exciting new ideas about the hippocampus

14:33.760 --> 14:37.560
 is that hippocampus is important for memory.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.640
 So if you say that, you'll be impressed,

14:39.640 --> 14:42.760
 all your people at your cocktail party.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.040
 But what people have started to realize

14:46.040 --> 14:49.000
 that it's not just memory,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.960
 it's not just putting together associations

14:51.960 --> 14:54.800
 for what, where, and when of events

14:54.800 --> 14:56.680
 that happened in our past,

14:56.680 --> 14:58.640
 but it's putting together information

14:58.640 --> 15:01.480
 that is in our long-term memory banks

15:01.480 --> 15:04.200
 in interesting new ways.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.160
 I'm talking about imagination.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.620
 So without the hippocampus, yes, you can't remember things,

15:09.620 --> 15:13.880
 but actually you're not able to imagine events

15:13.880 --> 15:17.640
 or situations that you've never experienced before.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.680
 So what that says is the hippocampus is important for memory

15:21.680 --> 15:24.060
 is a too simple a way to think about it.

15:24.060 --> 15:26.480
 What the hippocampus is important for

15:26.480 --> 15:28.060
 is what we've already talked about,

15:28.060 --> 15:30.760
 associating things together writ large.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.540
 Anytime you need to associate something together,

15:33.540 --> 15:37.080
 either for your past, your present, or your future,

15:37.080 --> 15:38.760
 you are using your hippocampus.

15:38.760 --> 15:43.040
 And it takes on this much more important role

15:43.040 --> 15:45.920
 in our cognitive lives when we think about it like that.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.520
 That is kind of the new, the new hippocampus

15:49.520 --> 15:52.400
 that neuroscientists are studying these days.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.240
 That's fantastic.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.720
 So it sounds like it really sets context,

15:55.720 --> 15:58.120
 but it can do that with elements from the past,

15:58.120 --> 15:59.800
 the present, or the future.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.620
 Yes.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.440
 Well, for neuroscientists, the phrase is domain.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.960
 We say the time domain,

16:05.960 --> 16:08.360
 meaning as opposed to just evaluating things in space.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.720
 It sounds like the time domain of hippocampal functioning

16:11.720 --> 16:13.100
 is incredibly interesting.

16:13.100 --> 16:13.940
 It is.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.920
 And even the fact that we can have short-term,

16:15.920 --> 16:17.120
 medium-term, and long-term memories,

16:17.120 --> 16:19.800
 and we could go down any of these rabbit holes.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.080
 I'll ask you a true or false,

16:21.080 --> 16:23.960
 mostly because I just really want to know the answer.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.400
 A few years ago, the theme in various high-profile reviews

16:27.400 --> 16:30.800
 seemed to be that the hippocampus was involved in encoding,

16:30.800 --> 16:33.760
 in creating memories, but not in storing memories,

16:33.760 --> 16:36.400
 and that the memory storage was in the neocortex

16:36.400 --> 16:38.620
 or the other overlying areas of the brain.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.620
 Is that too general a statement?

16:43.240 --> 16:45.760
 That's a tricky statement

16:45.760 --> 16:49.940
 because I think that ultimately, yes,

16:49.940 --> 16:53.320
 that long-term memories are stored in the cortex,

16:53.320 --> 16:55.640
 but those memories are stored in the hippocampus

16:55.640 --> 16:58.520
 sometimes for a very, very long time.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.920
 So how long is too long,

17:01.920 --> 17:03.720
 where you say, oh, it's not the hippocampus anymore?

17:03.720 --> 17:06.360
 If it's four years, is that?

17:06.360 --> 17:09.920
 Does that mean that it's not stored in the hippocampus?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.200
 I think that's a tricky question.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.820
 And yes, it was coming up a lot

17:13.820 --> 17:15.600
 because people were debating it,

17:15.600 --> 17:18.320
 and some people did think that you shouldn't think

17:18.320 --> 17:20.760
 about the hippocampus as a storage area.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.480
 But I think it's a long, long, long-term

17:23.480 --> 17:26.360
 kind of intermediate storage area,

17:26.360 --> 17:28.640
 maybe not the long-term storage area.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.460
 That's why it's hard to answer that question.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.600
 Great.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.120
 As I recall,

17:33.120 --> 17:37.280
 HM could remember facts from before his surgery.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.280
 He couldn't form new memories.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.960
 And given that he had no hippocampus,

17:40.960 --> 17:43.380
 it would at least partially support the idea

17:43.380 --> 17:47.120
 that some memories are retained outside the hippocampus.

17:47.120 --> 17:51.720
 However, he did have part of his posterior hippocampus

17:51.720 --> 17:54.800
 intact, so that's the tricky thing.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.800
 I think initially, in fact, Scoville, the neurosurgeon,

17:59.800 --> 18:03.640
 overestimated the number of millimeters

18:03.640 --> 18:07.360
 he intended to remove of the hippocampus.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.080
 And then when they did this,

18:09.080 --> 18:14.080
 the very historic MRI of HM later in his life,

18:14.520 --> 18:15.920
 they showed that, in fact,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.880
 he did have that posterior hippocampus,

18:17.880 --> 18:19.960
 part of the posterior hippocampus intact.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.120
 So now it makes it a little bit more complicated

18:24.120 --> 18:25.600
 to interpret what's going on.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.460
 Not that it was never uncomplicated.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.440
 Any interpretation of a lesion in a patient,

18:31.440 --> 18:33.300
 as you know, is complicated.

18:33.300 --> 18:37.300
 But, you know, HM had this mythical role

18:37.300 --> 18:39.520
 in neuroscience and neurology,

18:39.520 --> 18:42.320
 and now it was complicated

18:42.320 --> 18:45.640
 because he does have more of the hippocampus intact.

18:45.640 --> 18:46.860
 I did not know that.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.840
 There are some memories that can be formed very quickly,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.600
 so-called one-trial learning.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.320
 And I'm just looking at this list again,

18:56.320 --> 18:58.260
 novelty, repetition, association,

18:58.260 --> 19:00.200
 and emotional resonance.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.600
 It seems like some experiences

19:03.600 --> 19:06.040
 can bypass the need for multiple repetitions.

19:06.040 --> 19:06.880
 Yeah, absolutely.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.000
 So, and unfortunately,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.200
 it seems that our nervous system is skewed

19:12.200 --> 19:16.720
 toward creating one-trial memories for negative events,

19:16.720 --> 19:18.960
 which has a survival-adaptive mechanism.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.200
 What is the neural connection that allows that to happen?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.740
 Is it the amygdala to hippocampus connection?

19:25.740 --> 19:26.580
 I mean, as you and I know,

19:26.580 --> 19:28.700
 it seems like every brain area ultimately

19:28.700 --> 19:29.800
 is connected to everything else.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.880
 It's just a question of through how many nodes,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.840
 just like every city is connected to another city.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
 It's just a question of how many flights and roads

19:35.840 --> 19:40.800
 do you have to traverse before you get there?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.820
 What is it about one-trial learning?

19:42.820 --> 19:45.880
 I mean, at a kind of top contour level,

19:45.880 --> 19:49.760
 how can we learn certain things so fast?

19:49.760 --> 19:51.360
 And other things are tricky.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.960
 And now every time I look at this white mug,

19:52.960 --> 19:54.320
 it's queuing up something special

19:54.320 --> 19:56.480
 that simply by virtue of saying it.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.320
 So is that one-trial memory?

19:58.320 --> 20:03.320
 But what is it about very emotionally salient events

20:03.680 --> 20:06.360
 that allow memories to get stamped in?

20:06.360 --> 20:10.240
 Yeah, I mean, I think you've already alluded to it.

20:10.240 --> 20:15.040
 That is, there is this protective function of our brains

20:15.040 --> 20:18.280
 that has evolved over the last 2.5 million years

20:18.280 --> 20:20.400
 that you need to pay attention

20:20.400 --> 20:24.000
 and remember certain things for your survival.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.560
 So some things that get stamped in, you know,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.640
 they're memories, but they're fear memories.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.840
 You know, if I get mugged on the subway

20:33.840 --> 20:35.880
 or, you know, there are terrible things

20:35.880 --> 20:38.900
 that could happen on the subway, as we just learned.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.160
 But if something terrible happens,

20:40.160 --> 20:43.920
 if something very scary happens, you remember that.

20:43.920 --> 20:48.400
 And that fear and that memory of all those things.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.240
 I mean, I have one, when I lived in Washington, DC,

20:52.240 --> 20:54.840
 I went to work at NIH on a Sunday afternoon

20:54.840 --> 20:57.360
 and I came back and when I rounded the corner

20:57.360 --> 21:01.640
 to my door of my apartment, it was crowbarred in.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.740
 Somebody had taken a crowbar, opened up my door

21:04.740 --> 21:09.740
 and stole all of my, the nicest things in my apartment,

21:09.920 --> 21:10.840
 which wasn't that nice

21:10.840 --> 21:13.320
 because I wasn't making that much money.

21:13.320 --> 21:18.320
 But ever since then, whenever I rounded that corner,

21:18.580 --> 21:19.720
 I still had that memory.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.320
 It was terrible because it put me in a terrible state

21:22.320 --> 21:24.460
 when I was just coming home.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.800
 And that's a survival mechanism.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.480
 Do you want to be alert to possible danger?

21:30.480 --> 21:31.760
 Absolutely, yes.

21:31.760 --> 21:35.440
 So part of those one trial memories,

21:35.440 --> 21:38.000
 I think is often taking advantage

21:38.000 --> 21:41.460
 of this evolutionarily developed system

21:41.460 --> 21:45.360
 to tamp in things that could be potentially dangerous to you

21:45.360 --> 21:46.540
 into your memory.

21:46.540 --> 21:51.200
 So you forever will remember this particular corner

21:51.200 --> 21:54.520
 or this hallway because that is where something

21:54.520 --> 21:56.640
 really bad happened to you.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.360
 It seems like a location.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.680
 We talk about conditioned place aversion,

22:00.680 --> 22:03.640
 which is just a geek speak for wanting to avoid the place

22:03.640 --> 22:04.680
 where something bad happened

22:04.680 --> 22:06.280
 or conditioned place preference,

22:06.280 --> 22:07.420
 wanting to go back to a place

22:07.420 --> 22:08.880
 where something positive happened.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.160
 We've been looking at a photograph

22:10.160 --> 22:12.520
 of where you had a wonderful time with somebody

22:12.520 --> 22:16.020
 and that can evoke all sorts of positive sensations.

22:16.020 --> 22:20.640
 It seems like at some level, as complex as the brain is,

22:20.640 --> 22:24.240
 the basic elements of feeling good or feeling lousy

22:24.240 --> 22:26.480
 are states within the brain and body.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.720
 And linking those to places

22:27.720 --> 22:30.400
 seems like it's a pretty straightforward formula.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.240
 Link place to state, link state to place, et cetera,

22:34.240 --> 22:36.980
 as your description just provided.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.640
 When we learn more complex information,

22:40.640 --> 22:45.520
 a poem, a concept, or we have to ratchet

22:45.520 --> 22:49.720
 through a set of ideas, that also involves memory.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.520
 I'm sure that we'll talk more about this,

22:53.520 --> 22:57.160
 but is there any way that you're aware of

22:57.160 --> 23:01.380
 that state, bodily state, can be leveraged

23:01.380 --> 23:06.000
 to enhance the speed or the quality

23:06.000 --> 23:09.240
 of memories and memory formation?

23:09.240 --> 23:12.760
 Because, you know, so to be clear about it,

23:12.760 --> 23:14.520
 it seems there's something very important

23:14.520 --> 23:16.120
 about this fourth, you know,

23:16.120 --> 23:19.380
 this emotional resonance component, right?

23:19.380 --> 23:22.080
 Novelty, the crowbar into the door is,

23:22.080 --> 23:24.080
 thank goodness, sounds like it was novel,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.220
 it wasn't a repeated theme, thank goodness.

23:26.220 --> 23:28.020
 So repetition is out and the association

23:28.020 --> 23:30.040
 is very, very strong.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.900
 But for people trying to learn information

23:32.900 --> 23:35.040
 that they're not that excited about,

23:35.040 --> 23:38.200
 or that repetition is hard,

23:38.200 --> 23:42.480
 or the novelty is simply that it's painful.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.240
 Yes, I've been there, absolutely.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.680
 Yeah, as have I.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.840
 Is there something that we can do

23:49.840 --> 23:52.500
 to leverage knowledge of how the memory system

23:52.500 --> 23:55.440
 works naturally to make that a more

23:55.440 --> 23:57.720
 straightforward process?

23:57.720 --> 24:02.720
 So I immediately turned to the things

24:03.060 --> 24:05.240
 that I've studied that you talk about

24:05.240 --> 24:07.220
 so beautifully on your podcast,

24:07.220 --> 24:12.220
 which are strategies, generally,

24:12.220 --> 24:14.180
 to make your brain work better.

24:14.180 --> 24:17.500
 I was just reminding myself of your podcast

24:17.500 --> 24:21.780
 about cold, because I use that every morning.

24:21.780 --> 24:22.780
 Oh, you do call it? I do.

24:22.780 --> 24:24.740
 Just take a moment and just tell us

24:24.740 --> 24:26.060
 what is your cold exposure protocol,

24:26.060 --> 24:27.420
 then I'll take you back to what you're saying.

24:27.420 --> 24:31.220
 So my cold exposure protocol is at the end

24:31.220 --> 24:35.060
 of every morning shower that I take,

24:35.060 --> 24:37.520
 you know, the shower is warm,

24:37.520 --> 24:40.540
 but I give myself a big blast of cold

24:40.540 --> 24:45.540
 at the end of that, and it makes me feel so good,

24:45.740 --> 24:48.140
 and because I've been doing it for several years,

24:48.140 --> 24:49.620
 it's so much less painful.

24:49.620 --> 24:53.600
 Okay, I admit, it was really painful at the beginning,

24:53.600 --> 24:55.820
 but it's much less painful.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.900
 I could handle the cold water,

24:57.900 --> 25:01.300
 and my pipes give nice, really cold water,

25:02.220 --> 25:06.820
 and I could feel the awakeness

25:06.820 --> 25:09.540
 kind of come up in me after that,

25:09.540 --> 25:12.100
 and I miss it if I forget to do it.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.100
 Sometimes I run back in and give myself that cold blast,

25:16.100 --> 25:20.220
 because it is upping, you know,

25:20.220 --> 25:21.940
 I think you talked about this on your podcast,

25:21.940 --> 25:23.660
 what's happening in the brain?

25:23.660 --> 25:26.860
 Basically, the cold stimulus, that shock,

25:26.860 --> 25:28.980
 that, you know, catching your breath, et cetera,

25:28.980 --> 25:31.480
 is adrenaline from the adrenals,

25:31.480 --> 25:33.540
 but also, from what we understand now,

25:33.540 --> 25:35.220
 some new neuroimaging.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.580
 There's epinephrine and norepinephrine released

25:37.580 --> 25:39.780
 from locus coeruleus, which again is a brain structure

25:39.780 --> 25:40.740
 in the back of the brain,

25:40.740 --> 25:42.620
 got sprinklers the rest of the brain

25:42.620 --> 25:44.820
 with a kind of a wake-up chemical,

25:44.820 --> 25:47.580
 and there's a long arc on dopamine release.

25:47.580 --> 25:51.500
 This paper back in 2000 showed that it's a steady increase

25:51.500 --> 25:54.100
 up to about 2.5 X of circulating dopamine,

25:54.100 --> 25:56.500
 so they weren't looking directly in the brain, admittedly,

25:56.500 --> 25:58.980
 but it goes on for four or five hours,

25:58.980 --> 26:02.060
 so the improved mood and the feeling of alertness

26:02.060 --> 26:02.940
 is a real thing.

26:02.940 --> 26:07.940
 Yeah, yeah, so I use that, I mean, so basically I use

26:08.180 --> 26:10.220
 my morning routine, what is my morning routine?

26:10.220 --> 26:15.220
 I get up, I do a 45-minute tea meditation,

26:15.300 --> 26:18.660
 so meditating over the brewing and drinking of tea

26:18.660 --> 26:23.300
 that I learned from a monk who has an institute in Taiwan

26:23.300 --> 26:25.660
 where he teaches tea meditation, love it.

26:25.660 --> 26:29.380
 I've learned all about tea, different kinds of tea,

26:29.380 --> 26:34.380
 and then I do a 30-minute cardio weights workout.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.820
 Then I take my shower with a hot, cold contrast.

26:41.940 --> 26:45.620
 And before that, key thing, if I wanna learn something

26:45.620 --> 26:50.620
 and I want to be able to get over the difficulty

26:52.020 --> 26:55.660
 of repeating things or just push myself to do stuff,

26:55.660 --> 26:59.780
 sleep, so good, good sleep, I've learned that

26:59.780 --> 27:03.700
 over the pandemic, I did sleep experiments on myself

27:03.700 --> 27:05.980
 and I learned that I was sleeping an hour less

27:05.980 --> 27:07.060
 than I really needed.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.620
 So I really need seven and a half to eight hours of sleep

27:09.620 --> 27:11.220
 and I was getting six and a half.

27:11.220 --> 27:16.220
 And so now, I get that seven and a half to eight hours

27:16.780 --> 27:18.980
 every single night and guess what?

27:18.980 --> 27:23.180
 I come to different difficult tasks and I am more willing

27:23.180 --> 27:26.540
 to give it a try, to try longer, to try harder,

27:26.540 --> 27:28.180
 and my brain works better.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.260
 And so I think probably if you go back

27:30.260 --> 27:32.660
 to all of your podcasts, you'll learn exactly

27:32.660 --> 27:34.940
 why each one of those things that I do,

27:34.940 --> 27:37.740
 which I would bet that you probably do too,

27:37.740 --> 27:39.660
 is helping my brain.

27:39.660 --> 27:42.660
 I guarantee they are and I'm impressed

27:42.660 --> 27:44.700
 that you do all these things, although not surprised.

27:44.700 --> 27:47.060
 And I should say that the extra hour of sleep

27:47.060 --> 27:50.380
 is really impressive and extremely beneficial.

27:50.380 --> 27:53.300
 I'm curious, do you get that in the early part of the night

27:53.300 --> 27:54.300
 by going to bed earlier?

27:54.300 --> 27:55.380
 Yeah, yeah.

27:55.380 --> 27:56.220
 Terrific.

27:56.220 --> 27:58.140
 And I should just mention,

27:58.140 --> 27:59.340
 because you're too humble to do it,

27:59.340 --> 28:01.420
 but I'll say it again, that yes,

28:01.420 --> 28:03.900
 not only are you a full professor running,

28:03.900 --> 28:06.380
 a tenured full professor and running a laboratory,

28:06.380 --> 28:07.420
 you teach undergraduates,

28:07.420 --> 28:10.460
 you have an important role in public education,

28:10.460 --> 28:11.820
 multiple books, and you're now Dean

28:11.820 --> 28:14.820
 of the College of Arts and Sciences at NYU.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.420
 So the extra hour of sleep is benefiting you

28:17.420 --> 28:21.940
 and as a consequence, benefiting everybody else as well.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.660
 Thanks for sharing with us your protocol.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.500
 I took you off the trajectory of what one can do,

28:26.500 --> 28:31.100
 but I think that people and I appreciate knowing,

28:31.100 --> 28:32.900
 kind of what the practical steps are.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.660
 Because knowing the science is important,

28:34.660 --> 28:36.540
 mechanism I do believe is important

28:36.540 --> 28:38.740
 for embedding protocols in people's minds

28:38.740 --> 28:39.900
 and why they might want to do them,

28:39.900 --> 28:43.660
 but really hearing that the mechanics of it is useful.

28:43.660 --> 28:45.700
 It sounds like everything together takes about an hour.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.540
 It's not an excessive amount of time,

28:47.540 --> 28:50.820
 but it probably gives you an outsized positive effect

28:50.820 --> 28:51.660
 on your day.

28:51.660 --> 28:56.380
 Absolutely, I definitely notice it if I'm not able to do it.

28:57.300 --> 29:00.420
 And when I don't, so I do this seven days a week.

29:00.420 --> 29:04.260
 It's also not just, you know, five days, seven days a week.

29:04.260 --> 29:06.060
 And when I can't do it,

29:06.060 --> 29:09.380
 it's usually early morning flights or things like that.

29:09.380 --> 29:13.980
 And I get over it, but it's critical,

29:13.980 --> 29:16.100
 critical for the working of my brain.

29:16.100 --> 29:16.940
 I love it.

29:16.940 --> 29:18.660
 And I'll just highlight one thing that you said

29:18.660 --> 29:20.140
 before we move on, which is that you said,

29:20.140 --> 29:22.740
 when sometimes if you get out of the shower before the cold,

29:22.740 --> 29:24.020
 you'll get back in.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.620
 That's to me, a really beautiful example

29:26.620 --> 29:28.820
 of condition place preference.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.580
 Now the cold showers become something

29:30.580 --> 29:32.180
 that you sort of look forward to.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.620
 I should say that nobody is immune

29:34.620 --> 29:36.820
 from the adrenaline increase of cold,

29:36.820 --> 29:39.300
 no matter how cold, this is what's interesting about cold.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.780
 It's one of the reasons why it's such an important part

29:41.780 --> 29:43.620
 of the screening for special operations.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.700
 You know, sort of SEAL teams,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.340
 but other branches of military too,

29:47.340 --> 29:50.620
 which is that there are very few stimuli

29:50.620 --> 29:52.620
 that you can give anyone

29:52.620 --> 29:57.620
 and consistently get an adrenaline release from that

29:57.620 --> 29:58.660
 without harming them.

29:58.660 --> 29:59.500
 You know, with heat,

29:59.500 --> 30:00.940
 eventually you need to use so much heat

30:00.940 --> 30:02.180
 that you damage tissue.

30:02.180 --> 30:03.620
 Or with exercise, you have to use,

30:03.620 --> 30:06.060
 once you exercise it, you can damage joints.

30:06.060 --> 30:11.060
 And it's this very kind of brilliant,

30:11.100 --> 30:13.020
 I don't know if it was intentional or not.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.620
 It's sort of an unintentional genius

30:14.620 --> 30:16.620
 that special operations has figured out

30:16.620 --> 30:19.420
 that by sending people back into the cold over and over,

30:19.420 --> 30:21.100
 it never really gets easier.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.660
 But over time, people actually start to crave it.

30:23.660 --> 30:26.620
 And it provides this reduction in inflammation, et cetera.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.340
 So anyway, beautiful practice.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.180
 Thank you.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.500
 I want to learn more about your tea meditation

30:30.500 --> 30:31.500
 later in the episode.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.580
 But in any event,

30:33.580 --> 30:38.580
 returning to ways that we can improve memory formation.

30:38.580 --> 30:43.420
 Maybe, if you would, tell us your story around this.

30:43.420 --> 30:44.860
 I know you've told it before,

30:44.860 --> 30:47.180
 but I think a lot of members of the audience

30:47.180 --> 30:49.460
 and I would love to hear how you came to this.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.300
 Because growing up in neuroscience,

30:51.300 --> 30:53.260
 I knew you as one of the,

30:53.260 --> 30:55.340
 I would say one of the three or four,

30:55.340 --> 30:57.420
 and they're all alongside one another.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.860
 Not, this isn't a hierarchical statement,

30:59.860 --> 31:03.060
 a three or four top memory researchers in the world, right?

31:03.060 --> 31:05.140
 Textbook materials, Suzuki.

31:05.140 --> 31:08.580
 My textbooks are filled with the word Suzuki,

31:08.580 --> 31:09.780
 your last name,

31:09.780 --> 31:14.780
 according to the information on memory and memory formation.

31:15.220 --> 31:17.100
 So you were doing that

31:17.100 --> 31:19.260
 and doing the things that academics do.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.420
 And then you're still doing that,

31:21.420 --> 31:24.460
 but still at a very high level,

31:24.460 --> 31:26.140
 but then things took a different direction.

31:26.140 --> 31:28.380
 And then maybe we could talk about your story

31:28.380 --> 31:32.780
 and how you came to the place you are at now,

31:32.780 --> 31:34.380
 because I think it provides a number of tools

31:34.380 --> 31:36.780
 that people could implement themselves.

31:36.780 --> 31:37.900
 Yeah, yeah.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.540
 So this story happened

31:40.540 --> 31:44.620
 as I was working to get tenure at NYU.

31:44.620 --> 31:48.420
 And as you know, it's a stress-filled process.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.580
 They give you six years to show your stuff

31:51.580 --> 31:53.860
 and you are judged in front of all your colleagues.

31:53.860 --> 31:55.140
 And either they say,

31:55.140 --> 31:56.420
 okay, you can join the club,

31:56.420 --> 31:57.580
 or they say, sorry,

31:57.580 --> 32:00.620
 you are humiliated in front of everybody.

32:00.620 --> 32:01.460
 This was what was going on.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.140
 They actually tell people to leave.

32:03.140 --> 32:04.420
 If you don't get tenure, you're gone.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.620
 You have to leave your institution.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.900
 And so you work really, really hard.

32:09.900 --> 32:12.740
 And so my strategy was,

32:12.740 --> 32:14.540
 I'm just gonna not do anything but work

32:14.540 --> 32:15.700
 and I'm just gonna work

32:15.700 --> 32:19.340
 and I'm going to just work as hard as I can

32:19.340 --> 32:20.540
 for the six years.

32:20.540 --> 32:23.020
 And what happens when you work

32:23.020 --> 32:26.300
 and you don't have any sort of life outside of work

32:26.300 --> 32:27.980
 and you live in New York

32:27.980 --> 32:30.340
 where there's all sorts of really good takeout,

32:30.340 --> 32:32.620
 you gain 25 pounds, which is exactly what I did.

32:32.620 --> 32:34.180
 And you get really, really stressed

32:34.180 --> 32:35.540
 and you start to ask yourself,

32:35.540 --> 32:37.060
 how come I'm living in New York City

32:37.060 --> 32:38.300
 and I love Broadway

32:38.300 --> 32:41.980
 and I haven't gone to a Broadway show in two years.

32:43.020 --> 32:46.580
 And so I,

32:46.580 --> 32:47.940
 25 pounds overweight,

32:49.780 --> 32:52.100
 I decided to go on vacation

32:52.100 --> 32:53.900
 and I went by myself

32:53.900 --> 32:54.820
 because I had no friends.

32:54.820 --> 32:56.500
 And I went to,

32:56.500 --> 32:58.540
 I did a adventure

32:58.540 --> 33:02.580
 on a river rafting trip in Peru.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.380
 And so I go by myself

33:04.380 --> 33:06.860
 and meet other interesting people.

33:06.860 --> 33:10.660
 And I was the weakest person on this whole trip.

33:10.660 --> 33:12.220
 Like I was,

33:12.220 --> 33:15.660
 they were so much in better shape,

33:15.660 --> 33:17.060
 it was embarrassing.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.340
 And they won't say this,

33:18.340 --> 33:19.420
 they won't admit this to me,

33:19.420 --> 33:20.420
 but it was true.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.780
 And I kind of came back and I said,

33:21.780 --> 33:24.940
 okay, I cannot be the weakest person.

33:24.940 --> 33:26.180
 I'm in my late thirties,

33:26.180 --> 33:27.500
 I have to do something.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.700
 So I went to the gym

33:28.700 --> 33:30.180
 and I said,

33:30.180 --> 33:31.860
 oh my God, I'm 25 pounds overweight.

33:31.860 --> 33:35.020
 Let's try at least to lose this weight.

33:35.020 --> 33:37.020
 And so I go to the gym.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.060
 I notice how much better I feel

33:39.060 --> 33:40.700
 when I go to just a single class.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.180
 I remember the very first class I went to

33:42.180 --> 33:43.500
 was a hip hop dance class.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.260
 I'm a terrible hip hop dancer,

33:45.260 --> 33:48.820
 but I still felt good after that class.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.260
 And then fast forward year and a half,

33:52.260 --> 33:53.780
 I've lost the 25 pounds.

33:53.780 --> 33:55.620
 So proud of myself,

33:55.620 --> 33:57.140
 so much happier.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.420
 And I'm sitting in my office doing what

33:59.420 --> 34:00.420
 you and I do a lot,

34:00.420 --> 34:02.100
 which is writing an NIH grant,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.100
 which is our lifeblood, right?

34:04.100 --> 34:06.420
 And writing, writing, writing,

34:06.420 --> 34:08.340
 and this thought goes through my mind

34:08.340 --> 34:10.580
 that had never gone through my mind before,

34:10.580 --> 34:12.660
 which was during this six years

34:12.660 --> 34:15.060
 of frantic grant writing

34:15.060 --> 34:16.500
 when I was trying to get tenure.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.460
 And that thought was,

34:18.460 --> 34:20.540
 grant writing went well today.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.700
 You know, that felt good.

34:22.700 --> 34:24.060
 I was like,

34:24.060 --> 34:25.460
 I've never had that thought before.

34:25.460 --> 34:26.460
 What's going on here?

34:26.460 --> 34:27.740
 This is really weird.

34:27.740 --> 34:29.980
 I don't know that anyone has had that thought before.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.020
 No, I'm sure people have had that thought.

34:32.020 --> 34:36.580
 But I thought maybe I'm just having a good day.

34:36.580 --> 34:38.140
 But when I thought about it,

34:38.140 --> 34:40.620
 I thought it's not just today.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.820
 My grant writing seems to have been getting smoother.

34:44.820 --> 34:47.380
 Like I'm able to focus longer.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.500
 The sessions feel better to me.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.140
 And you know, at that point,

34:52.140 --> 34:53.860
 the only thing that I changed in my life,

34:53.860 --> 34:54.700
 it was a huge thing,

34:54.700 --> 34:56.740
 but I had become a gym rat

34:56.740 --> 34:59.060
 rather than a workaholic.

34:59.060 --> 35:04.060
 And that's when my spidey sense for neuroscientists

35:04.100 --> 35:04.940
 popped up.

35:04.940 --> 35:05.860
 And I said,

35:05.860 --> 35:08.860
 what do we know about the effects of exercise on your brain?

35:08.860 --> 35:10.820
 Because if I think about it,

35:10.820 --> 35:12.860
 what was better about my writing is

35:12.860 --> 35:14.940
 I could focus longer and deeper,

35:14.940 --> 35:16.140
 very important.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.060
 And I could remember those little details

35:19.060 --> 35:20.300
 that you try and pull together

35:20.300 --> 35:22.620
 for your million dollar NIH grant

35:22.620 --> 35:25.900
 from 30 different articles that you have open on your screen

35:25.900 --> 35:27.180
 all at the same time.

35:27.180 --> 35:28.980
 That's the hippocampal memory.

35:28.980 --> 35:29.900
 I was studying that.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.820
 I was writing the grants on hippocampal memory.

35:32.820 --> 35:37.260
 And so that's when I got really interested

35:37.260 --> 35:39.540
 in the effects of exercise

35:39.540 --> 35:42.860
 on both prefrontal focus and attention function

35:42.860 --> 35:44.340
 and hippocampal function

35:44.340 --> 35:46.900
 because of my own observation and this kind of,

35:46.900 --> 35:48.820
 I still remember where I was sitting,

35:48.820 --> 35:52.060
 which office I was in when I had this revelation.

35:52.060 --> 35:53.900
 But the thing that really sealed it for me

35:53.900 --> 35:55.660
 that made me think,

35:55.660 --> 35:57.540
 not just, oh, this is interesting,

35:57.540 --> 35:59.980
 but I wanna study this,

35:59.980 --> 36:02.940
 is right around that time,

36:02.940 --> 36:04.620
 I got a phone call from my mom

36:05.900 --> 36:09.020
 who said that my dad wasn't feeling well

36:09.020 --> 36:13.340
 and that he had told her that he got lost

36:13.340 --> 36:14.940
 driving back from the 7-Eleven,

36:14.940 --> 36:17.900
 which is literally seven blocks from our house

36:17.900 --> 36:19.500
 that I grew up in.

36:19.500 --> 36:23.180
 And I knew that was hippocampal function.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.900
 I suspected dementia.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.220
 I suspected, though didn't wanna admit,

36:27.220 --> 36:29.780
 Alzheimer's dementia, which he had.

36:29.780 --> 36:32.140
 And it was funny because,

36:32.140 --> 36:33.100
 I mean, it wasn't funny,

36:33.100 --> 36:38.100
 but my mom and dad are two sides of a very different coin.

36:39.500 --> 36:43.940
 My dad is the engineer,

36:43.940 --> 36:45.460
 not so active all his life,

36:45.460 --> 36:48.900
 but loved and sit and read books all day.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.580
 My mom was the athlete.

36:50.580 --> 36:54.580
 She played tennis, team tennis into her 80s.

36:54.580 --> 36:59.020
 And it started to show at that point.

36:59.020 --> 37:04.020
 And so then I had even a more pressing reason

37:05.820 --> 37:08.100
 to think about what the effects of exercise were

37:08.100 --> 37:10.460
 because I noticed that all the things

37:10.460 --> 37:12.540
 that were improving in my brain

37:12.540 --> 37:14.660
 suddenly went away in my dad's brain.

37:14.660 --> 37:18.140
 Really, really smart guy, engineer in Silicon Valley

37:18.140 --> 37:22.700
 helped that push in Silicon Valley in the 70s happen.

37:23.740 --> 37:24.860
 He had no more memory.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.620
 He couldn't focus his attention.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.980
 His mood was rock bottom.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.100
 He's a very happy guy.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.060
 And everything was the opposite in me.

37:33.060 --> 37:34.420
 And I started thinking,

37:34.420 --> 37:36.620
 this isn't just something to help

37:36.620 --> 37:38.300
 somebody who wants to get tenure.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.660
 This is something that could help

37:41.660 --> 37:43.620
 millions and millions of people.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.900
 Most importantly, our aging population.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.300
 What's happening?

37:49.300 --> 37:53.020
 And so the thing that makes me wake up in the morning

37:53.020 --> 37:58.020
 is when I realized that every single time you move your body

37:58.540 --> 38:02.300
 you are releasing a whole bunch of neurochemicals.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.060
 And some of them we've talked about

38:04.060 --> 38:06.180
 that the good mood comes from dopamine

38:06.180 --> 38:08.340
 and serotonin and noradrenaline.

38:08.340 --> 38:10.060
 But the thing that gets released also,

38:10.060 --> 38:11.860
 particularly with aerobic exercise

38:11.860 --> 38:16.660
 is a growth factor called brain-derived neurotrophic factor

38:16.660 --> 38:18.340
 or BDNF.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.860
 And that is so important because what it does

38:20.860 --> 38:23.180
 is it goes directly to your hippocampus

38:23.180 --> 38:27.300
 and it helps brand new brain cells grow in your hippocampus.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.140
 We all have that.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.140
 Even if you're a couch potato

38:29.140 --> 38:31.620
 you can get new brain cells in your hippocampus to grow.

38:31.620 --> 38:35.580
 But it's like giving your hippocampus a boost

38:35.580 --> 38:39.420
 with this regular BDNF if you are exercising.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.300
 Which means that we all have the capacity

38:42.300 --> 38:46.460
 to grow a bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.900
 And so what I like to give people

38:48.900 --> 38:51.660
 is this image of every single time you move your body

38:51.660 --> 38:54.500
 it's like giving your brain this wonderful bubble bath

38:54.500 --> 38:55.820
 of neurochemicals.

38:55.820 --> 38:56.660
 What's going on?

38:56.660 --> 38:58.900
 I need my bubble bath of noradrenaline

38:58.900 --> 39:02.620
 and dopamine and serotonin and growth factors.

39:02.620 --> 39:05.860
 And with regular bubble baths, what am I doing?

39:05.860 --> 39:09.100
 I'm growing a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus.

39:09.100 --> 39:12.540
 And I'm not gonna cure my father's dementia,

39:12.540 --> 39:13.980
 Alzheimer's dementia.

39:13.980 --> 39:14.820
 But you know what?

39:14.820 --> 39:19.060
 If I go into my 70s with a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus,

39:19.060 --> 39:23.020
 even if I had that in my genes and it starts to kick in,

39:23.020 --> 39:26.380
 it's gonna take longer for that disease to start to affect

39:26.380 --> 39:29.220
 my ability to form and retain new long-term memories

39:29.220 --> 39:31.780
 for facts and events, which is my motivation

39:31.780 --> 39:34.300
 for getting up and doing my 30 to 45 minutes

39:34.300 --> 39:36.060
 of aerobic exercise every day.

39:36.060 --> 39:36.900
 Fantastic.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.100
 Quick question about your protocol,

39:41.100 --> 39:44.940
 just because, and then we'll discuss a few mechanistic

39:44.940 --> 39:47.460
 things related to what signals the body

39:47.460 --> 39:49.060
 might be sending the brain,

39:49.060 --> 39:54.060
 and a little bit more detail on BDNF and some circuitry.

39:54.860 --> 39:59.660
 So 30 to 45 minutes, it sounds like cardiovascular exercise

39:59.660 --> 40:01.860
 might be special.

40:01.860 --> 40:05.140
 But as I say that, and I think about the literature

40:05.140 --> 40:08.100
 that I'm aware of in mice and some in monkeys

40:08.100 --> 40:11.620
 and certainly in humans, looking at the effects of exercise

40:11.620 --> 40:13.900
 on brain function and typically the outcome

40:13.900 --> 40:15.540
 is improvement almost always.

40:15.540 --> 40:16.940
 I don't think I've ever seen a paper showing

40:16.940 --> 40:19.900
 that when animals or humans exercise more

40:19.900 --> 40:22.100
 that their brain gets worse.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.020
 I just can't think of a single paper.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.300
 It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.620
 I'm sure someone will put one in the comment section.

40:27.620 --> 40:30.340
 They'll find that one and thank you if you can find that.

40:30.340 --> 40:34.380
 But it seems like it's always cardiovascular exercise

40:34.380 --> 40:36.220
 and experimentally in a lab, it's a lot easier

40:36.220 --> 40:38.100
 to get a mouse to run on a treadmill

40:38.100 --> 40:39.540
 than it is to get a mouse to lift weights.

40:39.540 --> 40:41.180
 Although people have put a little ankle weights

40:41.180 --> 40:42.460
 on mice and done.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.800
 And the ways of getting mice to do resistance work

40:44.800 --> 40:46.180
 is actually a little bit barbaric

40:46.180 --> 40:49.100
 because oftentimes they'll incapacitate a limb

40:49.100 --> 40:50.500
 to overload another limb.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.780
 So it's an asymmetric thing.

40:51.780 --> 40:55.100
 It's not the same as sending them in to do squats

40:55.100 --> 40:56.500
 or deadlifts or something.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.220
 So, but cardiovascular exercise might be special.

41:00.220 --> 41:03.060
 And what are your thoughts on that?

41:03.060 --> 41:06.420
 And please first though, tell us your routine.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.960
 Your routine is 30 to 45 minutes of,

41:08.960 --> 41:11.420
 are you a Peloton cycler?

41:11.420 --> 41:13.300
 Does it matter?

41:13.300 --> 41:15.740
 I think that the data suggests

41:15.740 --> 41:18.200
 that as long as your heart rate is getting up

41:18.200 --> 41:20.820
 for these long-term effects on your hippocampus

41:20.820 --> 41:24.260
 and prefrontal cortex, you also get better

41:24.260 --> 41:26.940
 at shifting and focusing your attention.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.040
 For that you need cardiovascular.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.340
 And what I use is a video workout

41:32.340 --> 41:33.940
 that I started even before the pandemic

41:33.940 --> 41:35.140
 is called Daily Burn.

41:35.140 --> 41:38.020
 And it's just thousands of different workouts.

41:38.020 --> 41:42.420
 But I love, they are 30 minutes that I sometimes add on

41:42.420 --> 41:46.140
 a 10 to 15 minute stretch at the beginning or at the end.

41:46.140 --> 41:47.940
 But I love the variety.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.160
 Sometimes I do it with weights.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.460
 Sometimes I do it without weights.

41:51.460 --> 41:52.400
 I love kickboxing.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.260
 So they have a lot of kickboxing in there.

41:54.260 --> 41:58.060
 It just fits my routine.

41:58.060 --> 41:59.600
 And it's always there.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.620
 And I don't have to get all dressed up to go to the gym

42:02.620 --> 42:04.340
 to work out.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.540
 So that's what I do.

42:05.540 --> 42:07.820
 And that's a daily thing, seven days a week.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.400
 Seven days a week, fantastic.

42:10.660 --> 42:13.220
 So in terms of the way that some of these changes

42:13.220 --> 42:16.540
 are being conveyed from the body to the brain,

42:16.540 --> 42:17.740
 that fascinates me.

42:17.740 --> 42:18.940
 I mean, as you and I know,

42:18.940 --> 42:22.340
 and I'm sort of a repeating record on the podcast,

42:22.340 --> 42:24.340
 always saying, you got a brain,

42:24.340 --> 42:25.460
 but you also have a spinal cord

42:25.460 --> 42:27.100
 and then your nervous system connects everything.

42:27.100 --> 42:30.060
 Every organ in your body is basically signaled

42:30.060 --> 42:32.680
 to by the nervous system and back to the nervous system,

42:32.680 --> 42:34.120
 your spleen, everything.

42:34.120 --> 42:37.300
 But so let's imagine your morning routine,

42:37.300 --> 42:39.580
 you do your cardiovascular exercise.

42:39.580 --> 42:41.380
 Okay, so you're pumping more blood.

42:41.380 --> 42:43.220
 That's the definition of a higher heart rate.

42:43.220 --> 42:46.260
 Stroke volume of the heart goes up over time.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.420
 You're getting fitter.

42:47.420 --> 42:49.580
 So blood flow to the brain is increasing.

42:49.580 --> 42:53.420
 Do we know how that gets translated to a signal

42:53.420 --> 42:54.980
 to release more BDNF?

42:54.980 --> 42:57.700
 And then it raises this other question,

42:57.700 --> 42:59.780
 which is, does it matter where your mind is

42:59.780 --> 43:01.380
 when you exercise?

43:01.380 --> 43:03.700
 Because ultimately the brain, of course,

43:03.700 --> 43:05.420
 you can anchor your attention to the exercise

43:05.420 --> 43:07.740
 or you can be listening to a podcast or something else.

43:07.740 --> 43:09.800
 I've always wondered about this.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.440
 Can we enhance the effects of exercise

43:11.440 --> 43:13.800
 by combining the enhanced blood flow

43:13.800 --> 43:16.540
 with cognitive work during exercise?

43:16.540 --> 43:18.560
 Or is it simply a matter of just getting more blood flow

43:18.560 --> 43:19.820
 up to the hippocampus?

43:19.820 --> 43:23.040
 Yeah, I wish I had the answer to that question too.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.660
 My instinct is, yes, it matters,

43:26.660 --> 43:29.060
 partially because of the work of your colleague,

43:29.060 --> 43:33.620
 Alia Crum, on mindset and the power of that to change

43:33.620 --> 43:37.360
 how physiologically our body is responding.

43:37.360 --> 43:41.140
 So how could it not work in her experiments

43:41.140 --> 43:43.100
 and, or work in her experiments

43:43.100 --> 43:48.100
 and not work for my morning or our morning exercise routine?

43:48.300 --> 43:49.660
 But are there studies?

43:49.660 --> 43:51.180
 Point to a study, I don't know of one.

43:51.180 --> 43:55.380
 So exercise neuroscientists out there,

43:55.380 --> 43:59.100
 I'd love to see that study done.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.900
 So yes, it works.

44:00.900 --> 44:03.900
 Before I go into the aerobic thing,

44:03.900 --> 44:07.560
 I always like to start with the least amount of exercise

44:07.560 --> 44:10.140
 to get something really useful

44:10.140 --> 44:12.060
 because I don't want people to say,

44:12.060 --> 44:16.060
 oh God, I hate sweating and I don't wanna listen anymore.

44:16.060 --> 44:20.400
 So I always like to start with studies have shown

44:20.400 --> 44:24.720
 that just 10 minutes of walking outside can shift your mood.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.980
 That is part of that neurochemical bubble bath

44:26.980 --> 44:30.060
 that you're getting, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline.

44:30.060 --> 44:33.380
 And 10 minutes, and anybody can walk for 10 minutes.

44:34.300 --> 44:38.600
 And so that is, for all of you thinking that out there,

44:38.600 --> 44:40.120
 what is the minimum that I could get

44:40.120 --> 44:41.060
 some of these brain effects?

44:41.060 --> 44:43.380
 10 minutes of walking, anybody can do it.

44:43.380 --> 44:44.420
 Is outside important?

44:44.420 --> 44:47.440
 I'm a big believer in getting photons into the eyes.

44:47.440 --> 44:52.440
 It, I think that that study was done indoors on a treadmill.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.040
 So, and the comparison wasn't done,

44:56.040 --> 44:58.200
 but moving your, which is great.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.540
 I, you know, some in the middle of the pandemic,

45:00.540 --> 45:03.260
 I walked around my apartment for 30 minutes sometimes

45:03.260 --> 45:05.600
 just for some variety.

45:05.600 --> 45:09.480
 Felt like a rat on a running wheel, but yes.

45:09.480 --> 45:14.480
 So that minimum amount of movement in your body

45:14.480 --> 45:17.320
 can get you those mood effects.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.960
 But what about the big, fat, fluffy hippocampus?

45:20.960 --> 45:23.400
 What about the better performing prefrontal cortex?

45:23.400 --> 45:28.400
 That's where you start to need the cardio workout.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.920
 And from my reading of the literature,

45:30.920 --> 45:33.520
 there haven't been enough studies, you know,

45:33.520 --> 45:37.360
 directly comparing, contrasting, kickboxing with running

45:37.360 --> 45:41.360
 with whatever other cardio that you need to do.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.840
 But any cardio workout that is done

45:44.840 --> 45:46.200
 has these positive effects.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.260
 So I'm gonna say, my interpretation of that

45:48.260 --> 45:51.320
 is that whatever way you get your heart rate up,

45:51.320 --> 45:53.400
 including a power walk,

45:53.400 --> 45:55.280
 a power walk can get your heart rate up,

45:55.280 --> 45:57.260
 that is beneficial.

45:57.260 --> 45:59.900
 And what is happening, there are two pathways

45:59.900 --> 46:02.420
 that have been studied about how you go

46:02.420 --> 46:05.320
 from moving your body to more BDNF,

46:05.320 --> 46:09.520
 that neurotrophin that's increasing the growth

46:09.520 --> 46:11.360
 of new hippocampal brain cells.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.800
 The two pathways are the following.

46:12.800 --> 46:16.540
 One is a myokine, which is a protein released

46:16.540 --> 46:18.960
 by the muscles, and not your heart.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.760
 These are striated muscles in your body.

46:21.760 --> 46:25.480
 And so by running, these were studies done in rats

46:25.480 --> 46:29.040
 on running wheels, they showed that the running rats

46:29.040 --> 46:32.320
 had more of this myokine released,

46:32.320 --> 46:34.880
 the myokine passed the blood-brain barrier,

46:34.880 --> 46:39.640
 so got into the rarefied, very protected bloodstream

46:39.640 --> 46:41.480
 of inside the brain.

46:41.480 --> 46:44.600
 And that myokine stimulated the release

46:44.600 --> 46:47.120
 of BDNF in the brain.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.680
 That's pathway number one.

46:48.680 --> 46:52.080
 Pathway number two comes through the liver,

46:52.080 --> 46:56.400
 because exercise is a stress generally.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.240
 How do we know that?

46:57.240 --> 47:00.000
 Well, cortisol is released whenever we exercise.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.700
 We need that sugar in our blood,

47:03.700 --> 47:07.800
 and so that's how the physiological mechanisms work.

47:07.800 --> 47:12.800
 And so there is a ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate,

47:14.000 --> 47:15.900
 that we've known for a very long time

47:15.900 --> 47:19.240
 that gets released by the liver during exercise.

47:19.240 --> 47:22.640
 And we also know that that particular ketone

47:22.640 --> 47:24.240
 passes that blood-brain barrier,

47:24.240 --> 47:26.120
 and it's another stimulant for BDNF.

47:26.120 --> 47:29.880
 So kind of the final common pathway seems to be

47:29.880 --> 47:34.160
 BDNF stimulation in the hippocampus.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.780
 Is it the only one?

47:35.780 --> 47:37.240
 Probably not, but that's the one

47:37.240 --> 47:39.380
 that has been studied most clearly.

47:39.380 --> 47:42.840
 So it comes from all of our physiological systems,

47:42.840 --> 47:45.960
 our muscles working, our liver responding

47:45.960 --> 47:49.480
 to the stress of exercise, and what is it doing?

47:49.480 --> 47:54.480
 It is making our, giving more BDNF precursors

47:54.560 --> 47:59.040
 to get into our brain to cause the up-spike of BDNF,

47:59.040 --> 48:00.360
 which is part of your bubble bath

48:00.360 --> 48:02.200
 that you're getting every time you move.

48:02.200 --> 48:05.200
 I love that description of a factor from muscle

48:05.200 --> 48:06.200
 and a factor from liver,

48:06.200 --> 48:09.960
 because anytime we're thinking about movement of the body

48:09.960 --> 48:12.360
 and translating that to the brain,

48:12.360 --> 48:14.560
 as you so clearly pointed out,

48:14.560 --> 48:17.700
 that needs to be, it needs to traverse

48:17.700 --> 48:18.720
 the blood-brain barrier.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.240
 Not everything that happens in the body

48:20.240 --> 48:21.960
 is communicated to the brain,

48:21.960 --> 48:25.040
 and these seem like really important signals.

48:25.040 --> 48:28.720
 Beta-hydroxybutyrate, you mentioned, is a ketone.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.360
 I just want to underscore, that doesn't mean, folks,

48:31.360 --> 48:33.380
 that you need to be on a ketogenic diet.

48:33.380 --> 48:35.840
 I think people hear ketone and they think,

48:35.840 --> 48:38.920
 I know some people are, most people are not, I imagine.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.280
 There are ketones that are released in your brain and body

48:42.280 --> 48:45.640
 that can function, even if you're ingesting carbohydrates

48:45.640 --> 48:48.600
 and not ketogenic, just for a point of clarification.

48:49.520 --> 48:53.920
 This issue of new neurons is one that you hear a lot.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.560
 Neurogenesis, you're going to grow new neurons, new neurons.

48:56.560 --> 49:00.020
 And my understanding is that the rodent literature

49:00.020 --> 49:04.160
 is very clear, that animals that run on wheels more often,

49:04.160 --> 49:05.840
 it turns out rodents love to run on wheels.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.480
 Do you know these studies by Hoppe Hofster,

49:07.480 --> 49:08.880
 which are pretty funny?

49:08.880 --> 49:10.840
 They're very cool, by the way, Hoppe,

49:10.840 --> 49:14.380
 how a huge investigator, I'm not making light of them.

49:14.380 --> 49:17.400
 They put running wheels in a field

49:17.400 --> 49:20.800
 and wild rodents will run to the running wheel

49:20.800 --> 49:22.440
 and run on that running wheel.

49:22.440 --> 49:25.640
 So they really enjoy it, which I find amusing

49:25.640 --> 49:27.640
 for reasons that probably only a neuroscientist

49:27.640 --> 49:29.420
 would find amusing.

49:29.420 --> 49:33.640
 In any case, in rodents, it seems that running more

49:33.640 --> 49:36.640
 on a wheel can trigger neurogenesis,

49:36.640 --> 49:39.280
 literally the birth of new neurons

49:39.280 --> 49:41.960
 and the addition of new neurons to the hippocampus.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.740
 In monkeys, this has been controversial.

49:44.740 --> 49:46.640
 It seems it does happen in the hippocampus

49:46.640 --> 49:49.920
 and in the olfactory bulb, probably not in the neocortex.

49:49.920 --> 49:52.840
 Thinking back to the decades or more controversy

49:52.840 --> 49:55.040
 between Liz Gould and Pashko Rakesh,

49:55.040 --> 49:57.560
 I hope they settled their differences there.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.460
 Neuroscientists love to argue, it's what we do.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.920
 And in humans, I think it's been a bit controversial.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.920
 Some people say absolutely yes,

50:07.920 --> 50:09.280
 other people say absolutely no,

50:09.280 --> 50:12.020
 there are new neurons added to the adult brain.

50:13.480 --> 50:17.040
 I haven't followed that literature down to the detail,

50:17.040 --> 50:21.200
 but I do remember one study that I don't think is contested,

50:21.200 --> 50:24.380
 which is the work of Rusty Gage at the Salk Institute,

50:24.380 --> 50:28.800
 where they actually injected a sort of dye type marker

50:28.800 --> 50:31.720
 into the brains of terminally ill humans

50:31.720 --> 50:34.920
 who very graciously offered to have their brains removed

50:34.920 --> 50:36.880
 and dissected after death.

50:36.880 --> 50:40.880
 And in these, in some cases, very old,

50:40.880 --> 50:43.280
 terminally ill humans, they did see evidence

50:43.280 --> 50:46.600
 for new neurons being born in the hippocampus.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.780
 Can I trust that idea still?

50:48.780 --> 50:50.480
 Is that generally accepted?

50:50.480 --> 50:54.840
 Well, so after that study, which was quite a while ago,

50:54.840 --> 50:58.000
 there are more recent studies, still controversial,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.820
 but showing and demonstrating using even new

51:01.820 --> 51:03.560
 and better techniques than were used

51:03.560 --> 51:05.460
 in that original Rusty Gage study,

51:05.460 --> 51:07.680
 which was groundbreaking at the time,

51:07.680 --> 51:12.680
 that suggest and I think show that there are new neurons

51:13.480 --> 51:18.480
 born in adult human brains into the ninth decade of life.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.200
 So they not only did this,

51:20.200 --> 51:22.400
 I think those patients were in their 60s,

51:22.400 --> 51:24.480
 then they died of cancer,

51:25.480 --> 51:29.080
 but these new studies looking across the timeline,

51:29.080 --> 51:30.960
 can we see, because the other thing was,

51:30.960 --> 51:33.200
 yeah, maybe you have some when you're 20,

51:33.200 --> 51:34.800
 but by the time you're older

51:34.800 --> 51:36.920
 and you might need these new neurons,

51:36.920 --> 51:38.880
 you have no new neuron growth.

51:38.880 --> 51:43.680
 And so these studies seem to suggest that yes, yes, you did.

51:43.680 --> 51:47.440
 Yes, you do, and we all do, even into old age.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
 So, yeah.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.680
 Great, and I'll just take a moment to say that

51:50.680 --> 51:54.800
 I am personally not aware of any studies looking at

51:54.800 --> 51:57.680
 other forms of exercise besides cardiovascular exercise

51:57.680 --> 51:59.280
 for sake of brain health.

51:59.280 --> 52:02.080
 And this I think is an important gap in the literature

52:02.080 --> 52:04.400
 that ought to be filled, whether or not, for instance,

52:04.400 --> 52:06.320
 high intensity interval training,

52:06.320 --> 52:08.640
 or whether or not weight training,

52:09.520 --> 52:11.640
 which has other effects on the musculature.

52:11.640 --> 52:14.480
 So you can imagine perhaps the myokine to BDNF pathway,

52:14.480 --> 52:16.480
 the pathway one that you mentioned might be signaled,

52:16.480 --> 52:18.120
 but maybe not the liver pathway.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.920
 Maybe, yes, I'm speculating here.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.120
 Those studies need to be done.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.120
 To my knowledge, they just haven't been done yet,

52:24.120 --> 52:25.200
 but they should be done.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.360
 If you would, could you tell us about some of the more

52:28.360 --> 52:33.360
 specific effects of exercise on memory?

52:33.920 --> 52:37.760
 Memory is a broad category of effects and phenomena.

52:37.760 --> 52:40.600
 So things like, what comes to mind is short-term,

52:40.600 --> 52:42.920
 medium and long-term memory, reaction time,

52:42.920 --> 52:44.920
 learning math, at least for me,

52:44.920 --> 52:48.560
 is quite a bit different than learning history,

52:48.560 --> 52:50.280
 although there's certainly overlap

52:50.280 --> 52:52.440
 in the neural underpinnings.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.160
 What has been demonstrated in the laboratory

52:55.160 --> 52:57.800
 in animal models, but especially in humans?

52:57.800 --> 53:00.320
 And if you want to share with us any results

53:00.320 --> 53:02.920
 from your lab, published or unpublished,

53:02.920 --> 53:04.520
 I'm sure that the audience would be delighted

53:04.520 --> 53:05.360
 to learn about them.

53:05.360 --> 53:09.320
 Absolutely, let me start with kind of the immediate effects,

53:09.320 --> 53:11.160
 acute effects as they're called,

53:11.160 --> 53:13.000
 of exercise on the brain.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.840
 So this is asking, what does a one-off exercise session

53:16.840 --> 53:18.760
 do for your brain?

53:18.760 --> 53:23.760
 And there are three major effects that have been reproduced.

53:24.640 --> 53:27.840
 I've seen it in my lab, many labs have reproduced this.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.000
 So what do you get with a one-off?

53:30.000 --> 53:33.520
 This is usually an aerobic type exercise session,

53:33.520 --> 53:35.360
 30 to 45 minutes.

53:35.360 --> 53:39.240
 What you get is that mood boost, very, very consistent.

53:39.240 --> 53:44.240
 You get improved prefrontal function,

53:44.240 --> 53:47.480
 typically tested with a Stroop test,

53:47.480 --> 53:49.840
 which is a test that asks you to shift

53:49.840 --> 53:52.800
 and focus your attention in specific ways.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.280
 It's a challenging task and clearly dependent

53:55.280 --> 53:57.600
 on the prefrontal cortex, largely.

53:57.600 --> 54:01.200
 And significant improvements in reaction time.

54:01.200 --> 54:05.800
 So your speed at responding, often a motor kind of,

54:05.800 --> 54:09.920
 but cognitive motor response is improved.

54:09.920 --> 54:12.400
 Over the pandemic, one of the unpublished studies

54:12.400 --> 54:16.040
 that I did, looking at the effects of 30 minutes

54:16.040 --> 54:21.040
 of age-appropriate workout in subjects ranging in age

54:21.880 --> 54:25.120
 from their 20s all the way up to their 90s.

54:25.120 --> 54:29.880
 So what are the things that I saw most consistently?

54:29.880 --> 54:34.160
 Irrespective of your age, everybody got a decrease

54:34.160 --> 54:37.920
 anxiety and depression and a hostility score,

54:37.920 --> 54:39.760
 which is very important, you know?

54:39.760 --> 54:42.640
 So it's not just decreasing your anxiety and depression,

54:42.640 --> 54:45.080
 but decreasing your hostility levels.

54:45.080 --> 54:45.920
 Making the world a better place.

54:45.920 --> 54:48.480
 Making the world a better place.

54:49.480 --> 54:52.440
 Energy, the feeling of energy went up.

54:52.440 --> 54:56.360
 And what we found is in the older population,

54:56.360 --> 54:58.920
 even more than in the younger population,

54:58.920 --> 55:02.200
 we saw improved performance on both Stroop

55:02.200 --> 55:06.240
 and Erikson-Flanker task, which is another task

55:06.240 --> 55:10.560
 dependent on really focusing in on different letters

55:10.560 --> 55:13.360
 and paying attention to what letter is being shown.

55:13.360 --> 55:17.080
 So these are consistent effects.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.200
 How long do they last?

55:18.200 --> 55:19.960
 One of the studies that I did publish in my lab

55:19.960 --> 55:22.840
 showed that the immediate effects of exercise

55:22.840 --> 55:25.600
 lasted up to two hours.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.400
 Unfortunately, that was the longest that we lasted.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.800
 We're still there at two hours.

55:29.800 --> 55:33.320
 So that's, you know, that's a pretty big bang

55:33.320 --> 55:34.160
 for your buck.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.480
 One 30 minute.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.320
 Sorry to interrupt.

55:36.320 --> 55:37.160
 I just want to make sure I understand.

55:37.160 --> 55:40.400
 So if, when you say the effects lasted up to two hours,

55:40.400 --> 55:43.840
 does that mean up to two hours after you finished exercise

55:43.840 --> 55:48.040
 or up to two hours of memory challenging work?

55:51.040 --> 55:52.600
 Yeah, just to be clear.

55:52.600 --> 55:53.760
 Yeah, that's a great question.

55:53.760 --> 55:57.200
 So my study looked at,

55:57.200 --> 56:00.320
 two hours after you finish your workout,

56:00.320 --> 56:01.960
 we gave you these cognitive tests.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.880
 During that two hour period,

56:03.880 --> 56:06.920
 you were free to do anything except exercise or eat.

56:06.920 --> 56:11.440
 And so there was no extra load on people.

56:11.440 --> 56:14.640
 But two hours later, you did do significantly better

56:14.640 --> 56:17.120
 on these focused attention tasks

56:17.120 --> 56:21.800
 compared to a group that watched videos

56:21.800 --> 56:23.520
 for the exercise period.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.160
 This was an hour and a half.

56:25.160 --> 56:29.160
 For the exercise period, this was an hour of cycling

56:29.160 --> 56:30.000
 that they did.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.920
 These were young subjects in their 20s.

56:31.920 --> 56:36.920
 Okay, so if I finish my exercise at 9 a.m.,

56:36.960 --> 56:39.480
 even if I start this cognitive work,

56:39.480 --> 56:42.680
 this mental work at 11, I'll still see benefits.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.400
 Yes, at least by 11,

56:44.400 --> 56:47.440
 because I didn't go farther than two hours.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.440
 So it could last even longer than that.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.960
 But I have evidence that it lasts for two hours.

56:51.960 --> 56:54.680
 And perhaps if I had started the cognitive work

56:54.680 --> 56:57.360
 and 45 minutes after my exercise ended,

56:57.360 --> 56:59.160
 it would also be helpful.

56:59.160 --> 57:01.560
 So there's no reason I think that you have to wait

57:01.560 --> 57:02.400
 before starting cognitive work.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.600
 Yeah, no reason at all.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.240
 I'm asking questions of the sort that I get in the comments

57:06.240 --> 57:07.920
 that we are going to get in the comments section.

57:07.920 --> 57:10.200
 We always strive for clarity here.

57:10.200 --> 57:14.560
 So what this tells me is that exercising early in the day

57:15.520 --> 57:18.000
 may have a special effect.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.080
 I realize that some people cannot exercise

57:20.080 --> 57:21.760
 until later in the evening,

57:21.760 --> 57:23.720
 but you mentioned something earlier

57:23.720 --> 57:25.000
 that I want to cue people to.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.040
 It's very, very important.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.800
 I don't think I've ever mentioned this on the podcast,

57:27.800 --> 57:30.720
 which is any kind of physical activity

57:30.720 --> 57:34.000
 will increase cortisol to varying degrees.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.520
 And so sometimes it's a healthy increase.

57:35.520 --> 57:36.920
 Sometimes it's an unhealthy increase.

57:36.920 --> 57:39.040
 If you do two hours of really intense exercise

57:39.040 --> 57:40.520
 and you're not prepared for it,

57:40.520 --> 57:42.000
 that's a big spike in cortisol,

57:42.000 --> 57:45.120
 probably not a good thing for most people.

57:45.120 --> 57:47.560
 But if you are going to do your cardiovascular

57:47.560 --> 57:50.080
 or weight training later in the day,

57:50.080 --> 57:51.640
 that increase in cortisol

57:51.640 --> 57:54.640
 can promote too much wakefulness for sleep, et cetera.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.480
 Shifting that cortisol spike early in the day

57:57.480 --> 57:59.200
 is associated with a number of important things

57:59.200 --> 58:02.000
 related to mood, et cetera.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.080
 But more and more what I'm thinking and hearing

58:05.080 --> 58:07.080
 is that exercise early in the day is key.

58:07.080 --> 58:10.080
 Our former dean of the medical school, Phil Pizzo,

58:10.080 --> 58:11.840
 was and is kind of famous still

58:11.840 --> 58:16.200
 for jogging between the hours of like four and 5 a.m.

58:16.200 --> 58:19.040
 or five and six and then running the medical school.

58:19.040 --> 58:22.040
 So, and you're up early doing your exercise

58:22.040 --> 58:23.680
 and cold shower and meditation.

58:23.680 --> 58:25.040
 We'll talk about meditation.

58:25.040 --> 58:28.240
 But this is more and more of a push, I feel like,

58:28.240 --> 58:31.200
 or a stimulus for us to think about

58:31.200 --> 58:33.240
 moving our exercise earlier in the day.

58:33.240 --> 58:35.840
 Yeah, I mean, I like to say that,

58:35.840 --> 58:39.600
 I know there are moms and dads out there

58:39.600 --> 58:41.840
 and they just say, look, I have a kid.

58:41.840 --> 58:44.400
 The kid's more important than my doing my exercise.

58:44.400 --> 58:47.160
 So you will get benefits

58:47.160 --> 58:49.520
 if you do it whenever you can.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.040
 So that's great, more power to you.

58:52.040 --> 58:55.160
 But what all the neuroscience data suggests

58:55.160 --> 58:58.320
 is the best time to do your exercise

58:58.320 --> 59:01.120
 is right before you need to use your brain

59:01.120 --> 59:04.160
 in the most important way that you need to use it every day.

59:04.160 --> 59:07.960
 And so that is why the morning, for most of us,

59:07.960 --> 59:08.800
 is beneficial.

59:08.800 --> 59:10.000
 That's why I do it in the morning.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.840
 I'm lucky enough to be able to do that.

59:12.840 --> 59:17.080
 But yeah, it makes sense with everything we know about.

59:17.080 --> 59:20.120
 How this works and how it benefits our brain.

59:20.120 --> 59:23.920
 I think about our colleague, Eric Kandel,

59:23.920 --> 59:27.520
 who not incidentally has a Nobel Prize in studies memory.

59:27.520 --> 59:32.160
 And rumor has it that he's been a swimmer

59:32.160 --> 59:33.760
 for a lot of years that he put in,

59:33.760 --> 59:35.720
 I think nowadays he's in his 90s.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.280
 Now he'll put in half a mile,

59:38.280 --> 59:41.000
 but he used to swim a mile a day or something of that sort.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.880
 I heard that too, that he was a swimmer

59:42.880 --> 59:44.800
 and he does it very, very religiously.

59:44.800 --> 59:46.720
 Okay, so there are a few other neuroscientists

59:46.720 --> 59:47.560
 that do that.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.560
 I can think of a lot of neuroscientists

59:48.560 --> 59:50.000
 that probably should exercise more.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.320
 And I don't say that to poke at them.

59:51.320 --> 59:53.680
 I just would love to see them doing their incredible work

59:53.680 --> 59:55.080
 for many more decades.

59:55.080 --> 59:56.280
 And everything that we're talking about today

59:56.280 --> 59:58.160
 indicates that if one doesn't,

59:59.200 --> 1:00:02.240
 unless you have incredible genetics,

1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:05.040
 we all experience age-related dementia, right?

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:09.280
 I mean, the story of your father is a salient one.

1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:11.800
 And we should remember that as we go forward.

1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:13.680
 But I also want to emphasize,

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:15.760
 I'd love to get your thoughts on just memory

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:17.800
 and memory loss in general.

1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:22.080
 It seems we all get worse at remembering and learning things

1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:24.520
 even if we don't get Alzheimer's.

1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:27.560
 When does that typically start for humans?

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.560
 You know, I think there's so much variability,

1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:34.600
 not only because we are individuals,

1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:39.280
 but because our stress levels are different

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:42.560
 and everybody's anxiety level has gone up

1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:44.900
 in the last couple of years.

1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:46.800
 But that also has an effect.

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:50.280
 We don't remember as much in a highly stressful,

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:52.360
 highly anxious situation.

1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:56.080
 So, you know, as you know, it's hard to answer that question.

1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:57.520
 People say, okay, just tell me

1:00:57.520 --> 1:00:58.760
 how much exercise I have to do.

1:00:58.760 --> 1:00:59.600
 Okay, just-

1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:00.720
 30 to 40 miles, it's a day.

1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:02.880
 But I love that per day.

1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:04.600
 You know, I've been doing this whole thing

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:07.880
 of telling people, oh, the data say 150 to 200 minutes

1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:10.520
 or zone two cardio, which is kind of, you know,

1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:12.920
 moderately hard, but not excessively hard.

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:17.440
 But I love this every day theme because whenever I do that,

1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:18.480
 the questions that come back are,

1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:20.520
 well, what if I take a long hike on the weekends?

1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.080
 And so people start negotiating.

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:23.280
 There's something that's very powerful

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:24.920
 about non-negotiable every day.

1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:27.520
 Sun in your eyes every day, even through cloud cover.

1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:29.680
 Exercise for 30, 45 minutes.

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.800
 Cold shower every day.

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:31.880
 Every day, yeah.

1:01:33.780 --> 1:01:36.020
 You know, my understanding of the literature

1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:38.800
 is that somewhere in our 50s or 60s,

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.720
 we start noticing little hiccups in memory.

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.120
 Yeah.

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.620
 For some people younger, for some people later.

1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:46.460
 Yeah.

1:01:46.460 --> 1:01:49.880
 But I have to imagine that doing the exercise

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.320
 throughout one's entire life

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.200
 is going to help offset some of this,

1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:56.560
 simply because of the BDNF and other downstream effects.

1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:57.400
 Yeah, yeah.

1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:59.760
 I mean, that's what it suggests.

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:01.280
 One of my favorite studies,

1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:03.720
 and then I want to get back to you wanted,

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.680
 you invited me to share some of my unpublished data

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:08.920
 on the effects of long-term exercise.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:11.580
 But first I want to share one of my favorite studies,

1:02:11.580 --> 1:02:16.520
 which is a longitudinal study done in Swedish women.

1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.920
 And this was published in 2018.

1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:22.760
 And what they did was, back in the 1960s,

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:27.760
 they found Swedish women, 300 Swedish women in their 40s.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.520
 And they characterized them as low fit, mid fit, high fit.

1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:32.360
 Okay?

1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:33.560
 And then 40 years later,

1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:34.880
 they came back and found these women.

1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:36.840
 They let them live their lives.

1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:39.560
 And they asked what happened to these women

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:42.320
 as a function of whether they were low fit, mid fit,

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:44.640
 high fit in their 40s.

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:46.160
 They're now in their 80s.

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:51.160
 And what they found was that relative to the low fit

1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:55.960
 or mid fit women, the women that were high fit

1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.960
 gained nine more years of good cognition later in life.

1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:06.240
 Now, this is not a randomized control study.

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:08.440
 This is a correlational study.

1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:10.280
 But does it agree with everything

1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:12.600
 that we've been talking about today?

1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:13.440
 Yes.

1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:15.240
 Does it agree with this idea that, you know,

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.280
 the women that were high fit

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:19.400
 were giving their brains this bubble bath,

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.360
 you know, maybe not every day,

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:24.440
 but very, very regularly for that entire 40 years.

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:28.000
 And that built up their big, fat, beautiful hippocampi.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000
 Yes, it does.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.200
 So that's one of my favorite studies.

1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:32.020
 Yeah.

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:37.020
 Another cause for getting the exercise in consistently.

1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:38.280
 Yes.

1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:42.120
 You know, I am impressed by this 10 minute walk

1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.720
 and the improvements in mood from just a 10 minute walk.

1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:49.480
 But again, I think that daily repetition.

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:54.480
 Also, I have to imagine has effects on the very pathways

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:56.080
 that allow plasticity.

1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:58.640
 This is something we, in the realm of neuroplasticity,

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.520
 we don't often hear about or think about,

1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:01.480
 even as neuroscientists,

1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:04.120
 which is that the pathways for engaging plasticity

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:07.440
 probably can be, probably, I'm speculating here,

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:09.080
 can be made better

1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:11.120
 by engaging in the sorts of behavior

1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:12.440
 that stimulate plasticity.

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:13.520
 In other words, if one gets better

1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:15.560
 at calming themselves down under stress,

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:18.040
 those circuits get better at doing that, right?

1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:20.680
 There's a neural circuits gain proficiency.

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:23.560
 And so, because blood vessels can grow,

1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:25.400
 capillaries can grow in the brain,

1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:29.280
 you can imagine that more pumping of blood to the brain,

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:33.520
 delivery of these various muscle and liver factors

1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:37.960
 would also establish larger or more efficient portals

1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:39.480
 to getting that stuff there.

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:42.600
 So you could imagine a kind of an amplifying effect

1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:43.440
 of exercise.

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:44.400
 And again, I'm speculating here,

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:47.360
 but I've seen this over and over again in colleagues,

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:50.360
 the ones who exercise consistently

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:53.360
 seem to be really, really smart and doing amazing work

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:55.200
 well into their eighties and nineties.

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:56.680
 And the ones who aren't,

1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:58.720
 some of whom actually pride themselves

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:03.120
 on how little they exercise, they get worse over time.

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:05.360
 You see them each meeting each decade

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:06.680
 and I'm not poking fun at them at all.

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:08.920
 It's actually quite hard to see.

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:10.320
 And they're kind of a fading light.

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:12.280
 They're starting to flicker.

1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:13.920
 So there is this incredible relationship

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.960
 between body vitality and brain vitality.

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:18.640
 That is, of course, is not an excuse

1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:20.640
 for spending all day in the gym, right?

1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:24.280
 The gym rats, I enjoy working out,

1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:25.560
 so I could imagine doing that.

1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:28.800
 But that doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately.

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:31.360
 You actually have to do the cognitive work also, right?

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:33.120
 It's not just exercise.

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:33.960
 So I'd love to hear about

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.800
 some of these new unpublished data.

1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:36.720
 Yeah, yeah.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:40.800
 Okay, so when I jumped into the exercise work,

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:44.800
 everybody was studying people 65 or older

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:47.360
 because that's when cognitive decline begins.

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:49.760
 And if the idea is exercise can help you

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:52.280
 with your cognition, then it makes sense.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:56.880
 However, I thought, well, you know, it's great.

1:05:56.880 --> 1:05:58.720
 There's lots of work there.

1:05:58.720 --> 1:06:01.800
 I wanted to know what happens in people

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:03.120
 in their 40s and their 50s,

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:06.320
 maybe even their 30s and their 20s.

1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:07.160
 Why?

1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:10.600
 Because that's when we as humans are able,

1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:14.120
 ready, willing, and able to increase our exercise

1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:18.480
 and gets us set up to build our brains

1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.480
 as we go into our 60s.

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:23.400
 And so the first study that I did

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:27.200
 looked at low-fit participants

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:30.640
 from their 30s to mid-50s.

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:34.120
 And we wanted to ask this question, you know,

1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:35.680
 how much exercise do you really need

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:37.040
 to start seeing benefits?

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:37.880
 Do you see benefits?

1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:39.280
 Or maybe you have to wait

1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:42.120
 until you start seeing cognitive decline to get benefits.

1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:44.400
 That was one of the theories out there.

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:46.360
 And so that's what I wanted to do.

1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:49.280
 And so what we did was three months

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:52.400
 of two to three times a week cardio.

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:53.840
 It was a spin class.

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:56.480
 So spin classes are great for cardio.

1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:59.800
 And the comparison group was two to three times a week

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:02.520
 of competitive video scrabble.

1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:05.040
 So no heart rate change,

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:07.920
 but they had to come into my lab and be in a group

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:11.880
 just like they were in a group for the spin class.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:14.960
 We tested them cognitively

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.960
 at the beginning of the end of the session.

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:21.440
 What we found was two to three times a week of cardio.

1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:22.920
 In these people, they were low-fit,

1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:24.960
 which means specifically

1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:28.520
 that they were exercising less than 30 minutes a week

1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:31.560
 for the three months previous to the experiment.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:32.800
 So they went from that

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:35.200
 to two to three times a week of spin class.

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:39.880
 And what we found was changes in baseline rates

1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:42.520
 of their positive mood states went up

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.280
 relative to the video scrabble group.

1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:48.720
 Their body image got more positive

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.800
 because they were exercising, which is great.

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:52.520
 And really important,

1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:56.280
 their motivation to exercise went up significantly

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:59.600
 compared to the video scrabble group, which is great.

1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:01.040
 So the more you exercise,

1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:03.800
 the more motivated you are to exercise.

1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:04.720
 What about cognition?

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:07.960
 What changed in the cognitive circuits of their brain?

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:11.880
 Number one, we got improved performance on the Stroop task,

1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:15.280
 but we're headed towards my favorite structure,

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:16.960
 which is the hippocampus.

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:19.880
 What we found was improved performance

1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:22.800
 on both a recognition memory task,

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:26.040
 which was a memory encoding task.

1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:31.040
 And that is, can you differentiate similar items

1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:34.360
 that we're asking you to remember?

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:37.800
 And an spatial episodic memory task

1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:40.800
 where we had them play one of those Doom-like games

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:42.840
 when they went into this spatial maze

1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:45.440
 and they had to do things in a virtual city.

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:47.040
 Their performance there got better,

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:49.520
 which is very, very classically dependent

1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:51.240
 on the hippocampus.

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:55.960
 So this, it was so satisfying to do this study

1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:59.480
 because I've been wanting to answer this question.

1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:04.480
 What is a minimum amount or doable amount of exercise

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.600
 that will get you these cognitive benefits?

1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:11.600
 And now I can say in 30 to 50 year olds

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:14.640
 that are low fit two to three times a week,

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:15.640
 is that doable?

1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:16.640
 Absolutely.

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:18.200
 Will it be hard if you're low fit?

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.000
 Yeah, it's gonna be challenging, but absolutely doable.

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000
 And so that is, it makes sense with all of the mechanisms

1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:31.480
 that we are, I didn't study the mechanisms just to be clear,

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:34.720
 but with all the mechanisms we are imagining

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:37.840
 are playing a role here, that absolutely makes sense

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:39.480
 and it is doable.

1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:43.200
 This is not like you have to become marathon runner

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:45.520
 to get any of these benefits.

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.560
 You have to start moving your body on a regular basis

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:50.520
 two to three times a week.

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.720
 And so I love that for its realness.

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:56.360
 How long are those sessions again?

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:57.200
 45 minutes.

1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:58.040
 45 minutes.

1:09:58.040 --> 1:09:59.200
 Yeah, 45 minutes.

1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:02.280
 It's a typical spin kind of class.

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:03.720
 There's a warmup for five minutes

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.000
 and a cool down for five minutes.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.400
 So it's really 35 minutes,

1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:12.320
 35 minutes of, you know, they're really pushing you.

1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:13.160
 Yeah.

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:15.240
 And so they're breathing reasonably hard,

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:16.560
 heart rate is up.

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:19.120
 Heart rate is definitely up, yeah.

1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:22.400
 I find that all of those results are really interesting

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:27.120
 that the result showing improvement in motivation

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.320
 to exercise is interesting because it gets back

1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:31.960
 to this issue of kind of a self-amplifying effect.

1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:36.480
 And the neuroscientist in me wants to think about

1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:39.400
 kind of pre-motor circuits and the fact that, you know,

1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:42.200
 we have a motor system that can obviously do things

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.760
 like lift cups and walk and run if we want to or need to,

1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:50.280
 but that it's possible to create a kind of anticipatory

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:51.720
 activity in our nervous system

1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.280
 where our body craves a certain stimulus.

1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:57.640
 You mentioned the cold and how you crave the cold.

1:10:57.640 --> 1:10:59.440
 Now, whether or not that's the adrenaline

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:01.160
 and the dopamine, et cetera,

1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:04.440
 or whether or not somebody who exercises

1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:07.240
 started going from zero, less than 30 minutes per week

1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:09.080
 to two to three times a week,

1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:12.240
 45 minutes as you described for this study,

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:16.720
 I've had that experience before of if I'm,

1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:19.080
 the cardio that I tend to battle the most,

1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:23.360
 and I love lifting heavy objects, at least heavy for me.

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:26.000
 I'm happy to go to the gym every other day

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.600
 and just lift heavy objects for an hour.

1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:28.480
 It just makes me happy.

1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:29.760
 I like the way it feels.

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:32.120
 And I've been doing it since I was in my teens,

1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:33.440
 so 30 years.

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:34.640
 Cardio is a little bit trickier.

1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:38.360
 I like to run, but if I stop running for a little while,

1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:40.160
 I find it very hard to get back into.

1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:42.240
 But if I start running three times a week

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:43.680
 for 30 to 45 minutes,

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:45.240
 and I do this pretty consistently

1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:46.760
 on the days I don't weight train,

1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:48.640
 I find that I start to crave it.

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:52.320
 It's almost as if my body needs that in order to,

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:53.840
 I always say clear out the cobwebs,

1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:56.040
 but it's like, my mind doesn't function as well, clearly.

1:11:56.040 --> 1:11:59.760
 Now I understand why and why exercise helps.

1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:01.600
 But also physically,

1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:04.160
 I almost feel like my body needs to engage in that movement.

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:06.720
 Like the pre-motor circuits are kind of revving,

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:09.240
 kind of like revving the engine or car while it's in park.

1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:12.800
 So the motivation to exercise obviously

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.720
 could be multifaceted.

1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:16.480
 It could be purely psychological,

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:19.320
 but do you think there's any reason to speculate at least

1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:23.800
 or believe that we can build an anticipatory,

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:26.120
 reverberatory activity in our nervous system?

1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:27.640
 Yeah, yeah.

1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:30.520
 You know, I agree with that

1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:35.040
 because I also have those same kinds of thoughts

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.040
 and I do have anticipatory exercise when I can't do it.

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:44.720
 So I just got back from a week and a half in Paris

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:47.520
 where I got to do a book launch of my last book,

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:48.600
 Good Anxiety.

1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:53.600
 And I walked around a lot,

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.800
 but I did not do my exercise for that whole week and a half.

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:00.760
 But there was a lot of stress

1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:02.240
 because I had to do all these interviews in French.

1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:03.400
 So I gave myself a break.

1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:04.240
 You speak French?

1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:05.080
 I speak French, yes.

1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:05.920
 I was gonna say otherwise it would be really stressful.

1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:07.360
 Yeah, that would be really stressful.

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.200
 Now then I'd be really impressed.

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.560
 Then I would definitely start exercising.

1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:14.000
 Actually, I would follow your morning routine to a T,

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.640
 but okay, very impressive nonetheless.

1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:21.640
 But I got back and coming back this direction from Paris,

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:25.320
 I live in New York, is much easier.

1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:28.480
 And so I was able to get up at a normal time the next day.

1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:30.640
 And that exercise session that first day,

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.120
 it's like, okay, I'm back in my home,

1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:34.200
 I'm back in my environment.

1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:36.200
 And it felt so good.

1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:38.720
 It's like I wanted to come back.

1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:43.720
 And I know it's because I worked up over years.

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:46.960
 Now I could truthfully say seven days a week,

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:50.200
 but it was, you know, first it was four to five,

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:54.360
 then it was five to six and yeah, seven,

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.120
 but that includes a yoga day

1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:58.480
 or sometimes I have to do it for 10 minutes instead of 30

1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:00.000
 because I have to leave.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.880
 But that habit of you do that even for five minutes,

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:08.000
 you do either the wait 10 minute thing

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.120
 or a five minute thing or a stretch.

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:14.040
 That is a tiny habit.

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:15.360
 Is that somebody at Stanford

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:17.760
 that invented this idea of tiny habits?

1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:18.760
 I thought it was.

1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:20.320
 Well, we've got a number of people there.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:22.680
 There's, and I apologize in advance

1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:25.320
 to all the people I neglect in this statement,

1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:28.360
 but I'm happy to put in the comments, folks.

1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:30.000
 BJ Fogg is there, has done-

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.640
 Yes, that's who I-

1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:34.560
 Yeah, BJ's done really great work.

1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:38.080
 And then James Clear wrote a book about habits

1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:40.840
 and has a very popular newsletter about habits.

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:42.080
 We've done an episode about habits

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:44.240
 that covers some of their work

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:47.160
 and some of the more laboratory-ish,

1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:50.480
 not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work on it.

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.720
 Daily behaviors, also daily behaviors

1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:55.320
 performed at roughly the same time of day.

1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:56.720
 I mean, one thing we know for sure

1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:59.040
 is that the circadian system

1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:02.840
 is part of our nervous system's way of anticipating

1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:05.320
 when things will happen, not just what will happen.

1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:07.880
 I'm telling you things you obviously know already,

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.600
 but for the audience, performing your exercise

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:14.040
 at roughly the same time each day will make it easier.

1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:14.880
 As opposed to just saying,

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:17.040
 I'm going to do it seven days a week sometime today.

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:18.880
 But of course getting it done sometime

1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:20.080
 is better than not getting it done.

1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:22.720
 Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:24.720
 Well, those are impressive effects.

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:27.120
 And I love that you're starting to look in populations

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:27.960
 that are a bit younger,

1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.920
 not because some of these older populations

1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:34.840
 aren't important, but I think that building good habits

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:37.480
 across one's entire life is really what it's about.

1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:41.360
 As I always say, with anything related to longevity

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:45.040
 or offsetting an age-related decline,

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.240
 we don't know, it's hard to know if things work

1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:50.480
 because there's no within-subject control.

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:52.380
 But what we also know for sure

1:15:52.380 --> 1:15:55.640
 is that you don't want to be the control experiment.

1:15:55.640 --> 1:15:57.800
 You absolutely don't want to be the control experiment,

1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:00.480
 especially for something that's purely behavioral.

1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:02.240
 I mean, you're not talking about ingesting

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:03.320
 a particular supplement.

1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:06.080
 You're not talking about changing your diet in any way.

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:11.080
 But I am curious, diet is a very barbed wire topic

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:14.120
 on the internet, which diets,

1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:15.600
 whether or not they work, et cetera.

1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:18.640
 But in general, in any of these studies,

1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:19.760
 do they evaluate whether or not

1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:21.280
 people change their eating habits

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:22.920
 when they start to exercise more?

1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:23.760
 Yeah.

1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:29.300
 I think I've seen one study that controlled for that,

1:16:29.300 --> 1:16:32.220
 but I feel for them because it's hard enough

1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:35.240
 to get people to exercise at the level

1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:40.060
 and at the time that you need for your study.

1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:42.440
 If you also ask them, okay, fill out this survey

1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:44.800
 to tell us exactly what you ate all day,

1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:46.660
 they're going to say, forget you.

1:16:46.660 --> 1:16:48.640
 I'm not joining your study.

1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:51.260
 So it's a critical question.

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:55.320
 And again, there's only been one that I've seen.

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:59.140
 And the evidence was that diets got better

1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:01.120
 when they, less processed foods,

1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:03.800
 when they did adhere to this exercise.

1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:07.120
 But a lot more information needs to be gathered

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:08.520
 in that realm.

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:10.540
 The second study that I wanted to share,

1:17:10.540 --> 1:17:13.160
 unpublished, we're writing it up right now,

1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:16.520
 is part two of that study that I just described,

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:18.440
 which was the low-fit people.

1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:20.120
 Next we moved to mid-fit people.

1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:21.260
 Like, what about us?

1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:23.220
 We're already exercising.

1:17:23.220 --> 1:17:27.600
 How am I going to benefit from increasing my exercise?

1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:31.840
 So here again, we collaborated with a great spin studio

1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:33.680
 that had a whole bunch of mid-fit people

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:37.400
 that by our definition were exercising

1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:39.680
 two to three times a week on a regular basis.

1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:40.520
 That's great.

1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:42.220
 All you people out there that are doing that,

1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:45.240
 you should know you're already benefiting your brain.

1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:48.240
 But our question was, what if we invited them

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:51.640
 to exercise as much as they wanted at the spin studio

1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:54.440
 for three months from two to three times

1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:56.440
 all the way up to seven times a week?

1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:58.120
 And let's just see what happened.

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:00.240
 And the control group,

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:04.280
 we asked them not to change their exercise.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:09.200
 And so what we ended up with was a nice big array

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:12.340
 of starting with mid-fit people

1:18:12.340 --> 1:18:15.240
 that exercise between staying at two to three times a week

1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.460
 all the way up to seven times a week.

1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:21.480
 And the bottom line from that study is

1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:23.520
 every drop of sweat counted.

1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.400
 That is, the more you change and you increase your workout

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:31.040
 up to seven times a week, the better your mood was.

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:35.880
 You had lower amounts of depression and anxiety,

1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:39.640
 higher amounts of good affect,

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:43.140
 and the better your hippocampal memory was

1:18:43.140 --> 1:18:45.000
 with the more you worked out.

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.940
 Again, this was for three months.

1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:50.140
 So I love that too, because it gives power

1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:54.500
 to those of us that are regularly exercising and wondering,

1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:57.520
 do I really need to, I mean, is it really gonna help me?

1:18:57.520 --> 1:18:58.600
 And the answer is yes.

1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:00.600
 I mean, not all of us can exercise,

1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:03.220
 go to a spin class seven times a week.

1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:08.220
 But I love the message that our body's responsive to that.

1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:11.600
 And you can get better hippocampal function,

1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:16.460
 better overall baseline mood affect with a higher level.

1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:19.460
 So it works for the mid-fit people as well.

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:21.240
 Fantastic.

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:22.720
 The more I learned from you,

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.200
 the more I've been starting to conceptualize the brain

1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:28.560
 as an organ that is privileged in so many ways,

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:31.360
 has this unique blood-brain barrier,

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:35.160
 has this incredible quality of being able to predict things.

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:36.760
 And its job mainly is, of course,

1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:40.160
 to predict things among other functions, of course.

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:45.160
 But that our brain isn't necessarily going to stay stable

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:47.160
 or get better over time.

1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:48.660
 That it needs a signal.

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:52.580
 That it isn't sufficient to just say

1:19:52.580 --> 1:19:53.840
 that we can't take it for granted.

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:58.600
 That our brain is actually an organ that requires a signal

1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:01.000
 in order to maintain its own function.

1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:03.200
 And it sounds like enhanced blood flow

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:05.180
 and these pathways that you described earlier,

1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:06.740
 these two pathways,

1:20:06.740 --> 1:20:10.460
 are at least among the more critical signals.

1:20:10.460 --> 1:20:13.400
 I'm tempted now to move my frequency

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:15.680
 of cardiovascular exercise from, I confess,

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:18.920
 it's about three days, 35 minutes lately,

1:20:18.920 --> 1:20:22.080
 and it should be more, to daily.

1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:24.320
 There's something, again, really special about daily

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:25.480
 because it's non-negotiable.

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:26.320
 You just do it.

1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:29.940
 And it sounds like if one were to do

1:20:29.940 --> 1:20:32.280
 higher intensity exercise,

1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:33.960
 in a spin class, I've never taken a spin class,

1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:35.760
 but I've seen there are times when they're standing up

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:37.360
 on the bike and pedaling very hard.

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:39.480
 So that is included in these kinds of workouts, right?

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:40.700
 Absolutely, yeah.

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:43.560
 I mean, that's what the instructor is doing.

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:45.700
 I cannot control.

1:20:45.700 --> 1:20:49.160
 We did not monitor heart rate of all the subjects.

1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:52.680
 And it was clearly, compared to the video Scrabble,

1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:54.000
 it was highly significant.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:54.900
 I would hope so.

1:20:54.900 --> 1:20:55.740
 Yes.

1:20:55.740 --> 1:20:58.200
 I guess it depends on how intense that game of Scrabble is.

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:04.360
 Could we just briefly talk about mindset and affirmations?

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:05.200
 Yeah, sure.

1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:09.060
 You've talked a bit before about affirmations.

1:21:09.060 --> 1:21:11.820
 And as you mentioned that the beautiful work

1:21:11.820 --> 1:21:14.520
 of my colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum,

1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:16.940
 and we can summarize her work pretty simply,

1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:18.560
 although we won't do it complete justice,

1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:19.780
 she's already been on the podcast,

1:21:19.780 --> 1:21:24.120
 that just to say that one's beliefs about a behavior

1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:26.640
 also impact the outcomes of that behavior.

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:29.800
 If you learn a lot of true facts

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:32.120
 about stress being good for you,

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:35.120
 then you will experience stress as better for you

1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:37.120
 than if you only focus on or learn

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:38.540
 about the negative effects of stress.

1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:40.920
 If you learn about the positive effects of exercise,

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:44.000
 you actually derive greater benefit from exercise,

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.240
 believe it or not.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:47.920
 It's incredible effects, but they make sense

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:49.520
 when you understand what the brain is doing,

1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:51.300
 which is a lot of this predictive coding

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:54.840
 and mindsets don't seem as mysterious and woo anymore

1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:56.980
 once you understand what the brain is really doing.

1:21:56.980 --> 1:22:01.980
 But what is, if any, the value of affirmation,

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:06.640
 of telling yourself something positive about yourself

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:10.280
 or of exercise on, not the exercise itself,

1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:14.220
 but on mood, self-image, memory, and brain function.

1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:18.680
 Yeah, so I looked into this

1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:22.720
 because I am also a certified exercise instructor

1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:26.400
 and the form of exercise that I teach is called Intensati.

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:29.000
 That it's a form of exercise that was developed

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.120
 by this amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno,

1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:35.360
 and she combined physical movements

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.600
 from kickbox and dance and yoga and martial arts

1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:41.080
 with positive spoken affirmations.

1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:43.000
 So each move, if you're punching back and forth,

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:46.360
 as you would do in a kickbox class, you don't just punch,

1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:49.520
 you say something like, I am strong now,

1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:52.080
 which every punch is associated with a word.

1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:57.080
 And you can create your own series of affirmations

1:22:57.080 --> 1:22:59.160
 with the moves that you put together.

1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:01.320
 And the first time I did it,

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:04.040
 I just wandered into her class, I didn't know what it was,

1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:06.800
 and I felt idiotic.

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:09.080
 It's like, I came into the wrong class.

1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:11.480
 I clearly, I don't want to come into this class.

1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:14.000
 But then I saw, they didn't care

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.800
 whether I thought they were, they looked silly,

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:20.840
 saying these, not saying, yelling these affirmations

1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:24.480
 out loud while doing the choreography at the same time.

1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:27.080
 And then I tried it, you know, okay, I didn't yell out.

1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:29.240
 I kind of whispered it at first.

1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:32.380
 And then, but by the end, I was really yelling it out.

1:23:32.380 --> 1:23:34.680
 There's something about the declaration,

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:39.440
 using your own voice, of saying things that you, you know,

1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:43.000
 don't often say to yourself, like, I'm strong, I'm inspired,

1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.520
 I believe I will succeed,

1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:47.020
 are all the kinds of affirmations you say.

1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:48.640
 And you walk out of that class,

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:50.320
 or I walked out of that class,

1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:54.960
 thinking, oh, I feel really good now, man.

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:57.360
 I can't wait to come back to this class,

1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:00.280
 which is why I ultimately took teacher training

1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:02.360
 to be able to teach that class.

1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:06.480
 And so I started to look into

1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:08.200
 what was known about affirmations.

1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:11.960
 And they were never combined with physical activity.

1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:15.520
 But it was clear that there was a literature showing

1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:20.520
 that positive affirmations, saying them or reading them,

1:24:20.540 --> 1:24:23.540
 could change mood in the same way as we're talking about,

1:24:23.540 --> 1:24:25.400
 you know, Aliyah Crum's work.

1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:29.120
 If you have this, it's a belief.

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:30.840
 Once you start saying these things,

1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:34.520
 these are not, you know, difficult things to believe,

1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:38.080
 but it's amazing how much you don't say

1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:41.620
 these kinds of things to yourself or with your own voice.

1:24:41.620 --> 1:24:43.200
 You might say them about somebody else.

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:45.740
 Oh, you're strong, you're so smart.

1:24:45.740 --> 1:24:47.280
 Do you say that about yourself?

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:50.680
 And that's the thing about the self affirmations.

1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:54.120
 It really gets you into a habit

1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:56.760
 of saying good things about yourself.

1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:59.760
 And then you start to realize, oh my God,

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:01.720
 I'm so mean to myself.

1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:04.840
 I have lots of negative thoughts going on

1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:07.520
 about myself in my head.

1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:09.160
 And which was part of the other reason

1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:13.360
 why I loved this particular form of exercise.

1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:18.360
 So what you get in Tenzati is the mood boost

1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:20.880
 from the positive spoken affirmations

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:25.280
 together with all the other brain and affect boosts

1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:28.760
 that we've been talking about for this whole podcast

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:32.400
 from the exercise, because it's a sweaty workout as well.

1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:33.520
 Interesting.

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:35.640
 There's a book, I confess I haven't read it,

1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:38.120
 but I have had the pleasure of having a discussion

1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:39.660
 with a psychologist from, I believe he's at

1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:43.400
 University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Ethan Cross,

1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:47.480
 wrote a book called Chatter, which focuses on the fact

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.840
 that so much of our inner dialogue is indeed negative.

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:54.360
 He certainly wasn't the first to point that out,

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.640
 but that explicit statements to counter

1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:00.700
 that negative chatter, I believe is one of the hallmarks

1:26:00.700 --> 1:26:05.160
 of readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame,

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.320
 but actually self-image generally.

1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:11.560
 And it's a fascinating, and I think a very important area

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:15.360
 of psychology and neuroscience, and I acknowledge this,

1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:17.800
 we're talking about this too, laboratory neuroscientists

1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:20.300
 who record from neurons and label neurons

1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:22.020
 and look at stuff down the microscope.

1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:24.000
 We are now deep in the territory,

1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.800
 in the deep water of what some of our colleagues

1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:29.720
 and people who think about neuroscience would consider

1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:33.280
 like really out there on the kind of subjective edges.

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:38.040
 And yet I think it's worth pointing out that

1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:39.480
 the brain does all these things.

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.900
 It's responsible for simple reflexes and motor behaviors,

1:26:41.900 --> 1:26:46.200
 but also high-level conceptual ideas about the universe

1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:48.280
 and what it might look like in 10 years or 100 years

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:52.000
 or 1,000 years, but also high-level conceptual understanding

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.960
 of who we are and what we are about.

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:57.180
 And so even though it might seem a little bit out

1:26:57.180 --> 1:27:00.640
 on the fringes, dare I say, I think that these are some

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:04.400
 of the more important untried landscapes of neuroscience.

1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:07.460
 And I just want to acknowledge my appreciation

1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:11.400
 for the fact that I'm going to connect the dots here

1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:13.680
 and say, you went from somebody who didn't exercise,

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:16.600
 who went on this rafting trip that discovered exercise

1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:18.720
 and its benefits for your grant writing

1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:20.680
 and then on and on and on,

1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:22.400
 and then became a certified-

1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:23.880
 Yeah, exercise instructor.

1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:25.000
 Instructor.

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:28.960
 So you don't do anything halfway either, as it's clear.

1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:33.580
 I'd like to touch on something you mentioned earlier,

1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:37.440
 but we haven't dove into it all in any depth,

1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:38.600
 which is meditation.

1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:42.760
 You mentioned this tea meditation.

1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:47.360
 You had a publication recently on a 10-minute meditation.

1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:50.160
 Maybe you could tell us about this 10-minute meditation

1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:53.080
 because it seems like such a tractable amount of time.

1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:53.920
 Right.

1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:55.680
 And then if you would maybe tell us a little bit

1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:56.680
 about the tea meditation,

1:27:56.680 --> 1:27:59.120
 but it sounds like you've discovered

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.280
 a close to minimum threshold of meditation

1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:04.320
 that can really benefit us.

1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:07.640
 So maybe you could tell us about that study.

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:12.640
 So the study was, as you very astutely pointed out,

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:16.920
 very practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes,

1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:19.280
 not an hour of meditation, that's too hard.

1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:21.720
 10 minutes guided meditation.

1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:24.400
 They logged into a site so we can tell that they logged in

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:28.240
 and they listened to a, it's a body scan,

1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:32.160
 very basic but easy to follow kind of meditation.

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:35.520
 And we asked them to do it how often?

1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:39.240
 Daily, seven days a week, just 10 minutes a day.

1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:41.680
 And the most shocking thing about this study

1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:45.600
 is that we got more adherence

1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:47.820
 to the 10-minute daily meditation

1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:50.680
 than the 10-minute daily podcast listening,

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:51.880
 which was our control.

1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:54.520
 So the highest retention rate I've ever gotten

1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:57.140
 in any, this kind of study that I've done,

1:28:57.140 --> 1:29:00.240
 exercise or meditation, they wanted to do it.

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:02.480
 10 minutes a day, it was great.

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:04.720
 I'm gonna just start leading meditations

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:08.080
 for three hours as I was doing three-hour podcasts.

1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:13.080
 So we looked at cognitive effects

1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:15.080
 before and after this.

1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:18.080
 It was eight weeks of daily, it was actually

1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:22.160
 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes of body scan meditation.

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:26.600
 And what we found was significant decreases

1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:27.720
 in stress response.

1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:32.720
 So we did the stress test to see how you responded

1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:35.320
 to an unexpected stressful situation.

1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:37.780
 The meditators did much better.

1:29:37.780 --> 1:29:41.840
 Their mood was better and their cognitive performance

1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:43.480
 was also better.

1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:47.480
 And this was my first little foray into meditation

1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:51.820
 after I had started my personal team meditation

1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:58.040
 that really shifted my relationship with meditation.

1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:03.800
 But it's consistent with many other studies

1:30:03.800 --> 1:30:08.080
 showing the beneficial effects of meditation.

1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:11.200
 But the unique thing was we tried to make it doable

1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:14.360
 that many, many people out there could actually follow

1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:17.160
 this typical regimen.

1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:21.120
 And so we're continuing that.

1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:24.240
 In fact, my research in my lab right now

1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:28.800
 is all about those doable, short things

1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:32.320
 that NYU college students will do,

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:34.240
 not just at the beginning of the semester

1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:36.260
 but at the end of the semester

1:30:36.260 --> 1:30:38.520
 when the stress and anxiety levels

1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:41.560
 are now at record-breaking high levels.

1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:44.640
 And they need something to bring that level down

1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:46.800
 so that they could show their professors

1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:49.000
 what their brains can actually do.

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.440
 And so it includes very short meditations,

1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:56.300
 sound meditations, visual meditations, walking,

1:30:56.300 --> 1:30:58.400
 things that any college student,

1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:03.400
 but we're obviously focused on NYU students, will do too.

1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:06.200
 And I wanna get at graduation rates.

1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:09.000
 I wanna get at class performance

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.720
 with these kinds of interventions.

1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:12.920
 But it started with that study

1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:14.880
 that I just described, meditation.

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:21.320
 If you would, and here's where we can highlight this again

1:31:21.320 --> 1:31:25.680
 as some highly educated speculation, it's coming from you.

1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:29.280
 What do you think is going on during meditation?

1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:33.400
 So a body scan involves a kind of an interoceptive awareness

1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:34.840
 like interoception, of course,

1:31:34.840 --> 1:31:37.760
 being an attention to what's going on on the surface of

1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:39.220
 and within the confines of our skin

1:31:39.220 --> 1:31:40.980
 as opposed to the outside world.

1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:46.360
 Drawing our attention to anything inside us or outside us

1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:48.800
 involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex,

1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:50.600
 presumably and other things.

1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:53.840
 Typically eyes are closed, typically it's relaxing.

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:55.120
 So there are a lot of variables

1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:58.480
 that could be feeding into a number of different effects.

1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:03.440
 But as a neuroscientist, what do you think is going on

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:07.680
 that this period of kind of a self-induced,

1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:09.240
 somewhat unusual state,

1:32:11.020 --> 1:32:13.940
 what do you think is going on in terms of network behavior

1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:16.400
 and networks within the brain

1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:18.560
 that it can have these long-term effects?

1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:19.680
 Because we got to some of the ones

1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:21.440
 who relate downstream of exercise.

1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:26.040
 And I think there's so much evidence.

1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:27.160
 I know there's so much evidence

1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:28.760
 that meditation is beneficial.

1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:31.200
 How do you think it's working?

1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:32.600
 Or what do you think it's doing?

1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:36.480
 Yeah, I think that one of the most important things

1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:41.400
 that gets worked when we're doing a simple 10 minute

1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:45.080
 or 12 minute body scan meditation regularly,

1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:47.720
 this 10 minutes a day, 12 minutes a day,

1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:52.680
 is the habit building and the practice

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:56.400
 of focusing on the present moment.

1:32:56.400 --> 1:33:00.600
 I think that is very hard for us modern humans to do

1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:03.920
 because I'm worrying about the thing that's due

1:33:04.940 --> 1:33:07.760
 at the end of the week that I need to do

1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:10.800
 and how many hours am I gonna have to be able to do that.

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:14.180
 Or I'm worried about whatever the email

1:33:14.180 --> 1:33:16.320
 that wasn't as polite as it should be that I sent

1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:19.340
 and what were the repercussions for that.

1:33:19.340 --> 1:33:24.340
 Instead of focusing on this moment, which is fun,

1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:26.880
 I get to talk to you.

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:28.440
 It's a beautiful day outside.

1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:32.000
 I'm feeling good right at this moment.

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:36.840
 And I think that all of the meditative practices

1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:40.760
 that I've done, and this one also,

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:43.360
 whether you know it or not,

1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:48.200
 is getting you to focus on this moment.

1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:52.080
 And I think it's even more important in this day and age

1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:55.900
 where anxiety levels and the next variant might come out

1:33:55.900 --> 1:33:57.600
 and what are the repercussions there.

1:33:57.600 --> 1:33:59.680
 And I have a mother who's older

1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:01.440
 and she's more susceptible to it,

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:04.400
 and there's a war and what's gonna happen there.

1:34:05.540 --> 1:34:09.120
 Those are all future possibilities.

1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:11.600
 And we should be worried about that.

1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:14.160
 That is a possibility you need to plan for that.

1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:19.080
 But you also need to focus on this moment right now.

1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:21.600
 I'm healthy, I can breathe.

1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:24.000
 I get to have this interesting conversation

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:24.960
 right in this moment.

1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:26.900
 If I start thinking about other things,

1:34:26.900 --> 1:34:30.160
 then it takes away from this moment.

1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:33.740
 Do I know what circuits are involved?

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:36.540
 Not exactly, that is not my area.

1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:39.080
 I think there are some studies that have focused

1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:44.080
 on that present moment kind of activity.

1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:46.680
 But that is what I think is most important

1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:49.000
 about the practice of meditation,

1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.880
 or one of the important things that calms us down.

1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:54.800
 Because if you know how to do that,

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:58.800
 that gives you this powerful tool for the rest of your day.

1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:03.040
 You're not locked into that fearful future thinking

1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:04.240
 that so many of us have,

1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:08.200
 or that just reliving of the terrible past,

1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:12.280
 but you could enjoy the present moment.

1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:14.120
 Yeah, that really resonates.

1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:16.640
 I think that going back to the earlier part

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:18.160
 of our conversation,

1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:22.360
 the hippocampus has this incredible storage capacity

1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:25.920
 and ability to set context about past, present, and future.

1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:27.640
 And that's a beautiful thing,

1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:29.840
 because as much as I like to think

1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:32.220
 he had some semblance of a healthy life,

1:35:32.220 --> 1:35:33.800
 none of us want to be HM.

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:35.400
 None of us want to be in the position

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:36.920
 of not being able to form new memories

1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:40.200
 and have no context to the past or the present.

1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:42.620
 So we're grateful that we should all be grateful

1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:46.160
 that our hippocampus can draw from past, present, and future

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:47.320
 in various combinations,

1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:49.960
 and we should support it through the daily exercise

1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:52.900
 and other habits, let's call them habits

1:35:52.900 --> 1:35:55.440
 so that people make them habits that you've highlighted.

1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:58.840
 But if we are not deliberately anchoring

1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:03.320
 within past, present, and future according to what we need,

1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:06.360
 and we're just shuffling between past, present, and future,

1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:08.540
 that is not a good way to live.

1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:09.380
 No.

1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:10.200
 It's not effective.

1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:11.040
 No.

1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:13.300
 It sounds like meditation can really help us

1:36:13.300 --> 1:36:15.000
 go to the right stacks.

1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000
 I guess people don't go to libraries anymore,

1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:18.240
 but in the old days,

1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:20.600
 you would go to the right location library.

1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:21.840
 You actually can't get distracted

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:23.440
 by the books that you're interested in

1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:25.440
 if you need to go just reflexively,

1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:27.360
 if you need to go study a particular topic.

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:29.320
 So that's kind of how I think about it.

1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.040
 It makes us more linear perhaps in our way of being.

1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:33.880
 I think so.

1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:35.460
 And it actually counteracts,

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:38.580
 not that I'm against technology,

1:36:38.580 --> 1:36:41.960
 but having our phones and being connected

1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:46.960
 to every good and bad thing going on in the world today

1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.840
 is incredibly distracting

1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:52.120
 and takes you away from the present moment

1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:54.000
 virtually 24 hours a day.

1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.600
 And so we have to work extra hard right now

1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:58.480
 compared to in the 40s

1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:00.280
 when we didn't have all this technology

1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:01.600
 or at the same level.

1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:05.400
 So yeah, it becomes even more important practice,

1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:07.000
 I think, for everyday life.

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.080
 Yeah, or even 10, 15 years ago,

1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:12.440
 it felt like smartphones weren't as intrusive.

1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:15.000
 One final question,

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000
 and maybe a request as the new incoming dean

1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:22.200
 of College of Letters and Sciences.

1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.680
 And I must say, I'm delighted, thrilled actually to hear

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:28.840
 that a lot of the practices that we've been discussing today

1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:31.040
 and that you've pioneered are going to be incorporated

1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:32.520
 into undergraduate education.

1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:34.600
 I predict, and I'd be willing to wager

1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:36.360
 that that will become a template

1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:40.080
 for how universities and non-university systems

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:40.920
 should function.

1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:43.920
 Because if indeed, and it is true

1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:46.520
 that there's this incredible relationship

1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:48.240
 between physical movement

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:51.720
 and mental deliberate practices and performance,

1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:56.160
 any corporation, school, household would be crazy,

1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:59.480
 would be self-limiting and even self-destructive

1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:00.840
 to not incorporate those.

1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:04.320
 So I'm so happy that you're gonna do this and collect data.

1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:06.200
 Please, we'll have to touch back with you

1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:08.720
 and hear what comes of that.

1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:12.280
 But one of the main things that I hear so much about today

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.560
 are issues with attention.

1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:15.560
 And we haven't talked about attention.

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:18.120
 We've mainly been talking about memory and cognition,

1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:20.120
 but you know a lot about attention.

1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:23.400
 And here, I'm not being disparaging.

1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:25.840
 I think people have done what I'm about to say

1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:30.000
 as a consequence of need and lack of other resources.

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.080
 There's an immense amount of Adderall use, Ritalin use,

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:35.560
 and modafinil use, and caffeine abuse.

1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:37.080
 Now, I happen to like caffeine.

1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:39.880
 I don't use the other compounds I described,

1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:44.320
 but it's just incredible to me how the data on this,

1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:46.600
 a colleague of mine at Stanford claims that

1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:49.480
 something like two-thirds or more of college students

1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:52.360
 use these without prescription for ADHD.

1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:58.480
 What can we expect in terms of the effects

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:00.520
 of regular exercise on attention?

1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:03.000
 And are there any other things besides exercise

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.280
 and meditation that you would like to see people do

1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:07.960
 in terms of trying to increase their powers of attention?

1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:11.400
 Because I think the ability to focus and attend

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:13.640
 is really the distinguishing feature

1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:16.400
 between those that will succeed in any endeavor

1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:18.000
 and those that won't.

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.920
 And that's a scary thing for a lot of people to hear

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:22.240
 because a lot of people think they have ADHD.

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:23.680
 They may, they may not.

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:26.320
 But I bet that a number of students at both Stanford

1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:30.960
 and NYU feel challenged with holding their attention

1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.920
 to the thing that they need to hold their attention to.

1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:34.040
 Yeah, yeah.

1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:39.040
 So I would say the top three tools that everybody

1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:44.000
 right this minute today can use to up their capacity

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.040
 to attend where they want to include exercise

1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:49.320
 for the reasons we've talked about.

1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:50.680
 It has a direct effect on

1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:53.480
 functioning of the prefrontal cortex, meditation also,

1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:58.240
 clear clinical studies showing improved ability to focus

1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.560
 and particularly focus on the present moment.

1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:03.720
 And the third has to be sleep.

1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:08.720
 So sleep is, you can't, it's out of the three,

1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:10.960
 it is the most physiological.

1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:13.520
 I mean, I could live my whole life

1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:15.600
 without meditating one minute.

1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:17.660
 Could I survive without sleep?

1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:19.240
 No, none of us could.

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:22.280
 So it's more basic physiological.

1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:27.280
 But it is so important for all core cognitive functions,

1:40:30.180 --> 1:40:32.760
 including attention, including creativity,

1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.760
 including just good basic brain function.

1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:46.680
 That is why it's so critical to get that information,

1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:49.560
 that basic neuroscience information

1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:51.680
 into the heads of these students

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:55.680
 that are trying their best to show us how their brain work,

1:40:55.680 --> 1:41:00.320
 but being hampered because they're not moving enough,

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:02.280
 they're not meditating.

1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:04.720
 And there's all these distracting things

1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:06.760
 that they include in their lives,

1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:09.320
 some of which a little bit is good,

1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:14.320
 but 24 hours a day on your phone and LinkedIn,

1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.820
 not LinkedIn, but linked to your phone,

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:20.840
 is damaging to your attention.

1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:25.840
 So exercise, meditation, sleep can help you learn,

1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:30.520
 retain and perform better

1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:34.000
 than if you do not have these three things in your life.

1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.120
 Wonderful, music to my ears,

1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:40.520
 and also either very low cost or zero cost,

1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:43.840
 considering that the exercise doesn't require a class.

1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:48.840
 One could use the freely available resource of gravity

1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:52.880
 to do jumping jacks or burpees or push-ups or whatever,

1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:54.160
 or sit-ups or all of those in combination.

1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:55.240
 And don't forget YouTube,

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:59.340
 the freely accessible millions of YouTube videos.

1:41:59.340 --> 1:42:02.360
 If you don't want to do your jumping jacks by yourself,

1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:03.440
 I always say this.

1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:08.180
 I talk about breath meditation for my book, Good Anxiety.

1:42:08.180 --> 1:42:11.120
 And if you don't like the one that I suggest,

1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:13.120
 there's only about a million more on YouTube

1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:16.040
 with ratings from one star to five stars.

1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:18.340
 So use that resource.

1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:20.140
 It is a wonderful resource.

1:42:20.140 --> 1:42:23.040
 And you are an amazing resource.

1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:26.000
 Wendy, thank you so much for coming here today

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.880
 to have this discussion and share your knowledge

1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:33.440
 about not just existing data, but new data coming out soon.

1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:37.500
 And for your leadership in the university system,

1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:39.320
 for your leadership in public education,

1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:42.280
 for the decades of important work on memory

1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:43.280
 and neural circuitry,

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:46.760
 which we got to learn about today as well.

1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:48.320
 Thank you ever so much.

1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:49.480
 Thank you, Andrew.

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:51.120
 Fun conversation.

1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:52.140
 Thank you for joining me today

1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:54.160
 for my discussion about learning and memory

1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:56.280
 and how to get better at learning and remembering

1:42:56.280 --> 1:42:57.920
 with Dr. Wendy Suzuki.

1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:00.200
 If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Suzuki's work,

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:02.960

1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:46.600
 We also have a Patreon, it's patreon.com slash

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.520
 Andrew Huberman, and there you can support the podcast

1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:51.080
 at any level that you like.

1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:53.020
 On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:43:53.020 --> 1:43:54.480
 we discuss supplements.

1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:56.240
 While supplements are certainly not necessary

1:43:56.240 --> 1:43:58.960
 for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit

1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:01.940
 from them for things like accelerating the transition

1:44:01.940 --> 1:44:04.600
 into sleep and getting better, deeper sleep,

1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:06.960
 as well as enhancing focus and learning

1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:10.080
 and other aspects of human performance and health.

1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:11.820
 We're excited to announce that we've partnered

1:44:11.820 --> 1:44:13.720
 with Momentous Supplements.

1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:16.520
 The reason we partnered with Momentous is several fold.

1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:19.000
 First of all, we wanted to have one location

1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.020
 where Huberman Lab Podcast listeners could go

1:44:21.020 --> 1:44:24.240
 in order to find all the supplements that we talk about

1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:26.760
 and to find those in a form where they could

1:44:26.760 --> 1:44:28.920
 systematically try one or the other.

1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:30.580
 This is a real issue in the supplement industry.

1:44:30.580 --> 1:44:32.480
 A lot of supplement brands out there combine

1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:35.000
 different ingredients in ways that don't really allow you

1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.100
 to pinpoint exactly what you need and what you don't need.

1:44:38.100 --> 1:44:41.960
 So getting supplements that have low doses

1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:45.340
 or just the minimal effective dose of particular ingredients

1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:47.960
 and being able to mix and match those ingredients yourself

1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:51.240
 and really establish what's best for you is really key.

1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:53.500
 In addition, we came to realize that a lot of our listeners

1:44:53.500 --> 1:44:55.440
 want supplements, but they reside outside

1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:56.740
 of the United States.

1:44:56.740 --> 1:44:58.600
 So we're pleased to tell you that Momentous ships

1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:01.080
 both within the US and internationally.

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:04.040
 And of course, Momentous Supplements are of the very highest

1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:06.760
 quality ingredients and the precision of the amounts

1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:09.360
 of those ingredients is tightly regulated.

1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:11.360
 If you're interested in Momentous Supplements,

1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:13.080
 the catalog of supplements related

1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:16.440
 to the Huberman Lab Podcast are growing all the time.

1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:18.080
 A good number of them are already there.

1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:20.840
 You can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman

1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:22.120
 in order to find them.

1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:24.440
 And there will be additional supplements added

1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:26.360
 to that site as we go forward.

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.260
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab

1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:31.460
 on Twitter and Instagram, I post neuroscience

1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:33.520
 and other science related information

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:35.720
 and tools on a regular basis.

1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:37.820
 Some of that information overlaps with the content

1:45:37.820 --> 1:45:40.320
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but a lot of it is distinct

1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:43.040
 from the information contained on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:45.320
 So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram

1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:47.280
 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:50.100
 We also have a neural network newsletter.

1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:53.600
 What that is is a monthly newsletter in which I distill

1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:56.120
 critical points from different podcast episodes,

1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:57.920
 provide links to useful resources.

1:45:57.920 --> 1:45:59.360
 If you want to sign up for that newsletter,

1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:01.000
 I should mention it is zero cost

1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:02.920
 and we do not share your email with anybody.

1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:05.960
 And we have a very clear privacy policy posted

1:46:05.960 --> 1:46:07.120
 at HubermanLab.com.

1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:10.280
 Just go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,

1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:11.880
 you'll see the neural network newsletter.

1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:13.840
 You can also look at examples of newsletters

1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:15.200
 without having to sign up to make sure

1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:17.400
 that you actually do want to sign up.

1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:20.080
 But if you are interested, the signup is there.

1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:22.880
 It's very easy and you can receive our monthly newsletter.

1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:25.080
 So once again, thank you for joining me today

1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:28.480
 for our voyage into the neuroscience of learning and memory

1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:31.020
 and tools to get better at learning and memory.

1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:34.080
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:51.080
 And as always, thank you for your interest in technology.
