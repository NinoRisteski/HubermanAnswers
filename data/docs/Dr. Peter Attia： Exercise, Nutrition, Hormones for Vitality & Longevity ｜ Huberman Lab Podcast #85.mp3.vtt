00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.360 --> 00:13.120
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.120 --> 00:14.940
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.560
 Today, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.720
 Dr. Attia is a physician who's focused on nutritional,

00:20.720 --> 00:24.160
 supplementation-based, behavioral, prescription drug,

00:24.160 --> 00:26.680
 and other interventions that promote healthspan

00:26.680 --> 00:28.020
 and lifespan.

00:28.020 --> 00:31.200
 His expertise spans from exercise physiology

00:31.200 --> 00:32.680
 to sleep physiology,

00:32.680 --> 00:35.700
 emotional and mental health, and pharmacology.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.940
 Today, we talk about all those areas of health,

00:37.940 --> 00:39.440
 starting with the very basics,

00:39.440 --> 00:42.920
 such as how to evaluate one's own health status

00:42.920 --> 00:45.800
 and how to define one's health trajectory.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.300
 We also talk about the various sorts of interventions

00:48.300 --> 00:51.660
 that one can take in order to optimize vitality

00:51.660 --> 00:55.080
 while also extending longevity, that is, lifespan.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.300
 Dr. Attia is uniquely qualified

00:57.300 --> 01:00.320
 to focus on the complete depth and breadth of topics

01:00.320 --> 01:01.240
 that we cover.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.880
 And indeed, these are the same topics

01:02.880 --> 01:06.160
 that he works with his patients on in his clinic every day.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.940
 Dr. Attia earned his bachelor of science

01:07.940 --> 01:10.360
 in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics

01:10.360 --> 01:14.000
 and his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.560
 He then went on to train at Johns Hopkins Hospital

01:16.560 --> 01:17.480
 in general surgery,

01:17.480 --> 01:19.600
 one of the premier hospitals in the world,

01:19.600 --> 01:21.840
 where he was the recipient of several prestigious awards,

01:21.840 --> 01:23.600
 including resident of the year.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.560
 He's been an author on comprehensive reviews

01:25.560 --> 01:26.800
 of general surgery.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.620
 He spent two years at the National Institutes of Health

01:29.620 --> 01:31.560
 as a surgical oncology fellow

01:31.560 --> 01:33.480
 at the National Cancer Institute,

01:33.480 --> 01:35.540
 where his work focused on immune-based therapies

01:35.540 --> 01:36.740
 for melanoma.

01:36.740 --> 01:38.080
 In the fields of science and medicine,

01:38.080 --> 01:40.080
 it is well understood that we are much the product

01:40.080 --> 01:42.760
 of our mentors and the mentoring we receive.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.840
 Dr. Attia has trained with some of the best

01:44.840 --> 01:47.360
 and most innovative lipidologists, endocrinologists,

01:47.360 --> 01:48.960
 gynecologists, sleep physiologists,

01:48.960 --> 01:52.520
 and longevity scientists in the United States and Canada.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.580
 So the expertise that funnels through him

01:54.580 --> 01:56.440
 and that he shares with us today

01:56.440 --> 01:58.760
 is really harnessed from the best of the best

01:58.760 --> 02:01.080
 and his extensive training and expertise.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.240
 By the end of today's episode,

02:02.240 --> 02:05.200
 you will have answers to important basic questions

02:05.200 --> 02:07.140
 such as, should you have blood work?

02:07.140 --> 02:09.040
 How often should you do blood work?

02:09.040 --> 02:10.960
 What specific things should you be looking for

02:10.960 --> 02:13.600
 on that blood work that are either counterintuitive

02:13.600 --> 02:17.240
 or not often discussed and yet that immediately

02:17.240 --> 02:20.000
 and in the long-term influence your lifespan

02:20.000 --> 02:20.920
 and health span?

02:20.920 --> 02:23.460
 We talk about hormone health and hormone therapies

02:23.460 --> 02:25.140
 for both men and women.

02:25.140 --> 02:28.780
 We talk about drug therapies that can influence the mind

02:28.780 --> 02:29.960
 as well as the body.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.100
 And of course, we talk about supplementation, nutrition,

02:32.100 --> 02:35.840
 exercise, and predictors of lifespan and health span.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.360
 It is an episode rich with information.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.300
 For some of you, you may want to get out a pen and paper

02:41.300 --> 02:42.580
 in order to take notes.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.840
 For others of you that learn better simply by listening,

02:45.840 --> 02:47.700
 just want to remind you that we have timestamped

02:47.700 --> 02:49.280
 all this information so that you can go back

02:49.280 --> 02:52.320
 to the specific topics most of interest to you.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.200
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:54.200 --> 02:56.520
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.760
 We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.440
 First of all, they ship internationally

03:00.440 --> 03:02.360
 because we know that many of you are located

03:02.360 --> 03:03.860
 outside of the United States.

03:03.860 --> 03:05.880
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

03:05.880 --> 03:08.420
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

03:08.420 --> 03:10.080
 both in terms of purity and precision

03:10.080 --> 03:12.040
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.680
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

03:14.680 --> 03:16.880
 that are single ingredient supplements

03:16.880 --> 03:19.640
 and that are supplied in dosages that allow you

03:19.640 --> 03:23.040
 to build a supplementation protocol that's optimized

03:23.040 --> 03:25.600
 for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness,

03:25.600 --> 03:27.760
 and that you can add things and remove things

03:27.760 --> 03:30.060
 from your protocol in a way that's really systematic

03:30.060 --> 03:30.900
 and scientific.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.040
 If you'd like to see the supplements

03:32.040 --> 03:33.360
 that we partner with Momentous on,

03:33.360 --> 03:36.480
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.640
 There you'll see those supplements and just keep in mind

03:38.640 --> 03:40.680
 that we are constantly expanding the library

03:40.680 --> 03:42.760
 of supplements available through Momentous

03:42.760 --> 03:43.720
 on a regular basis.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.320
 Again, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.880
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:48.880 --> 03:51.600
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:53.600 --> 03:56.000
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:56.000 --> 03:58.680
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.680
 In keeping with that theme,

03:59.680 --> 04:02.400
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.320
 Our first sponsor is Thesus.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.060
 Thesus makes custom nootropics that are designed

04:07.060 --> 04:08.840
 for your unique needs.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.100
 And to be honest, I'm not a fan of the word nootropics

04:11.100 --> 04:13.460
 because nootropics means smart drugs.

04:13.460 --> 04:16.960
 And to be honest, there is no such thing as a smart drug

04:16.960 --> 04:19.120
 because there's no neural circuit for being smart.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.540
 There are neural circuits rather for being creative

04:21.540 --> 04:23.720
 or for task switching or for focus.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.840
 As we all know, different sorts of demands,

04:25.840 --> 04:27.480
 whether or not they are cognitive or physical,

04:27.480 --> 04:31.340
 require different types of cognitive and physical abilities.

04:31.340 --> 04:33.960
 Thesus understands this and has created a kit

04:33.960 --> 04:36.720
 of custom nootropics that are tailored to your needs.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.860
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

04:38.860 --> 04:42.260
 you can go to takethesus.com slash Huberman,

04:42.260 --> 04:43.720
 take their three-minute quiz,

04:43.720 --> 04:45.600
 and Thesus will send you four different formulas

04:45.600 --> 04:46.880
 to try in your first month.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.040
 That's takethesus.com slash Huberman

04:49.040 --> 04:50.960
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

04:50.960 --> 04:54.320
 to get 10% off your first box of custom nootropics.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.200
 Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.560
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:59.560 --> 05:02.080
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

05:02.080 --> 05:03.640
 to help you better understand your body

05:03.640 --> 05:05.600
 and help you reach your health goals.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.120
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

05:08.120 --> 05:10.220
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

05:10.220 --> 05:12.240
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

05:12.240 --> 05:14.560
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.280
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.000
 you can also analyze, for instance,

05:19.000 --> 05:20.980
 what your biological age is and compare it

05:20.980 --> 05:22.280
 to your chronological age.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.760
 And obviously it's your biological age that really matters.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.240
 The challenge with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.320
 however, is that you get information back

05:30.320 --> 05:32.760
 about metabolic factors, hormones, and so forth,

05:32.760 --> 05:34.680
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.320
 InsideTracker makes it very easy to know what to do

05:37.320 --> 05:39.580
 with that information to optimize your health.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.240
 They have a personalized platform.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.860
 It's a dashboard that you go to.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.560
 You can click on the level of any hormone,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.240
 metabolic factor, lipid, et cetera,

05:46.240 --> 05:48.960
 and it will tell you the various sorts of interventions

05:48.960 --> 05:51.400
 based on nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,

05:51.400 --> 05:52.960
 that you can use to bring those numbers

05:52.960 --> 05:55.520
 into the ranges that are ideal for you.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.920
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

05:56.920 --> 05:59.660
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:59.660 --> 06:02.160
 to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.800
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.440
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.460
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

06:10.460 --> 06:12.360
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.400
 They also have some really unique features

06:14.400 --> 06:17.920
 because they are customized to your unique sleep needs.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.760
 I've talked over and over again on this podcast

06:19.760 --> 06:21.600
 and on another podcast about the fact

06:21.600 --> 06:24.080
 that sleep is the foundation of mental health,

06:24.080 --> 06:25.640
 physical health, and performance.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.500
 There's just simply no other substitute

06:27.500 --> 06:30.000
 for a quality night's sleep on a regular basis.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.360
 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

06:31.360 --> 06:32.420
 for well over a year now,

06:32.420 --> 06:34.360
 and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.720
 And that's in large part

06:35.720 --> 06:38.480
 because the mattress was designed for me.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.460
 What you need to know, however,

06:39.460 --> 06:41.040
 is what's the ideal mattress for you?

06:41.040 --> 06:43.360
 And you can do that by going to Helix site.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.720
 You can take their brief quiz, which will ask you,

06:45.720 --> 06:47.360
 do you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach,

06:47.360 --> 06:48.960
 or maybe you don't know, or maybe all three,

06:48.960 --> 06:50.520
 do you tend to run hot or cold in the night?

06:50.520 --> 06:52.480
 Maybe you know, maybe you don't.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
 At the end of that short quiz,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.180
 they will match you to the ideal mattress for you.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.500
 I matched to the DUSK, the D-U-S-K mattress,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.020
 but again, that's what I need.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.180
 That's not necessarily what you need

07:00.180 --> 07:02.060
 in order to get your best night's sleep.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.600
 But if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

07:03.600 --> 07:05.860
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

07:05.860 --> 07:07.120
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

07:07.120 --> 07:08.940
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.

07:08.940 --> 07:12.200
 And you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order

07:12.200 --> 07:13.400
 and two free pillows.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.280
 They have terrific pillows.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.440
 And you get to try out that mattress

07:15.440 --> 07:16.600
 for a hundred nights risk-free.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
 They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,

07:18.600 --> 07:19.800
 but I'm certain you will.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.640
 Again, if you're interested in,

07:20.640 --> 07:23.080
 you go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

07:23.080 --> 07:26.480
 for up to $200 off your mattress order and two free pillows.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.600
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.220
 Peter, thanks for joining me today.

07:31.220 --> 07:32.060
 Thanks for having me, man.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.800
 I've been looking forward to this for a very long time.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.640
 That's fine.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.280
 I'm a huge fan of your podcast.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.100
 I know that you went to Stanford

07:39.100 --> 07:40.320
 and worked with a number of people

07:40.320 --> 07:41.580
 that are colleagues of mine.

07:41.580 --> 07:45.560
 So for me, this is already a thrill just to be doing this.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.480
 Yeah, well, likewise.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.960
 I have a ton of questions,

07:48.960 --> 07:50.320
 but I want to start off with something

07:50.320 --> 07:51.700
 that I wonder a lot about

07:51.700 --> 07:54.760
 and that I know many other people wonder about,

07:54.760 --> 07:58.040
 which is how to assess their current health

07:58.040 --> 08:01.700
 and their trajectory in terms of health and wellbeing,

08:02.600 --> 08:04.680
 specifically as it relates to blood work.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.880
 So what are your thoughts on blood work?

08:05.880 --> 08:08.880
 Is it necessary for the typical person?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.120
 So this is somebody who's not dealing

08:10.120 --> 08:12.720
 with some acute syndrome or illness.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.800
 And at what age would you suggest

08:14.800 --> 08:16.080
 people start getting blood work?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.560
 How frequently should they get blood work?

08:18.560 --> 08:21.620
 How often do you get blood work done, et cetera?

08:21.620 --> 08:22.460
 Yeah, there's a lot there.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.960
 I mean, the way I talk about this with patients

08:23.960 --> 08:27.400
 is first taking everything back to the objective.

08:27.400 --> 08:31.920
 So what's the thing we're trying to optimize?

08:31.920 --> 08:34.160
 So if a person says,

08:34.160 --> 08:38.040
 look, I'm trying to break 10 hours for an Ironman,

08:38.040 --> 08:39.840
 I don't know that blood work is going to be

08:39.840 --> 08:43.120
 a game-changing aspect of their trajectory

08:43.120 --> 08:44.320
 and their training.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.800
 They're going to benefit much more

08:45.800 --> 08:48.840
 from sort of functional analysis of performance.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.440
 So I'm assuming based on the question

08:51.440 --> 08:53.560
 that you're really coming at this through the lens

08:53.560 --> 08:55.600
 of living longer and living better

08:55.600 --> 08:58.640
 through the lifespan, healthspan lens?

08:58.640 --> 09:01.760
 Yeah, and just, I think most people have some sense

09:01.760 --> 09:04.000
 of their vitality or lack of vitality,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.160
 but I think everyone wonders

09:05.160 --> 09:06.320
 whether or not they could feel better

09:06.320 --> 09:08.200
 and whether or not blood work will give them a window

09:08.200 --> 09:11.100
 into how they might go about feeling better.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.000
 Yeah, I think it does to some extent,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.360
 but I also think that it has a lot of blind spots.

09:15.360 --> 09:20.360
 So I kind of break things down into the two vectors

09:20.360 --> 09:23.600
 that make up longevity, which are lifespan and healthspan.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.640
 So lifespan is the easiest of those vectors to understand

09:26.640 --> 09:28.240
 because it's pretty binary, right?

09:28.240 --> 09:29.480
 You're alive or you're not alive,

09:29.480 --> 09:30.600
 you're respiring or you're not,

09:30.600 --> 09:33.120
 you make ATP or you don't, end of story.

09:33.120 --> 09:37.120
 So what gets in the way of lifespan

09:37.120 --> 09:40.960
 is essentially the four horsemen of disease, right?

09:40.960 --> 09:44.920
 So atherosclerotic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease

09:44.920 --> 09:46.160
 and metabolic disease,

09:46.160 --> 09:49.180
 which directly isn't the cause of many deaths,

09:49.180 --> 09:52.040
 but basically creates the foundation

09:52.040 --> 09:53.640
 to all of those other diseases.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.460
 So if you're a non-smoker, what I just rattled off

09:58.460 --> 10:01.080
 is about 80% of your death.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.080
 So how does blood work help address those?

10:05.080 --> 10:05.920
 It varies.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.640
 So on the atherosclerotic standpoint,

10:07.640 --> 10:09.640
 it's a very good predictor of risk

10:09.640 --> 10:11.660
 if you know what to look for.

10:11.660 --> 10:15.480
 So primarily ApoB would be the single most important

10:15.480 --> 10:17.240
 lipoprotein that we care about.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.480
 I gotta explain what that means in a second.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.100
 And then also other markers of inflammation,

10:22.100 --> 10:25.640
 endothelial health and metabolic health.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.100
 When it comes to cancer, blood testing

10:28.100 --> 10:30.600
 in the sense of biomarkers is not particularly helpful

10:30.600 --> 10:35.200
 outside of knowing that the second leading environmental

10:35.200 --> 10:36.920
 or modifiable cause of cancer

10:36.920 --> 10:38.720
 is metabolic ill health after smoking.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.880
 So we don't actually know a lot about cancer

10:41.880 --> 10:43.880
 in the sense of what causes it.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.520
 It's really stochastic and it's a lot of bad luck.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.240
 So we know that smoking drives it

10:48.240 --> 10:51.680
 and we know that even though epidemiologically

10:51.680 --> 10:52.900
 we say obesity drives it,

10:52.900 --> 10:54.880
 what it really means is metabolic poor health.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.560
 It's probably the hyperinsulinemia

10:56.560 --> 10:58.740
 that comes with obesity that drives it.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.820
 So biomarkers help with that,

11:00.820 --> 11:02.880
 but there's still an enormous blind spot to cancer.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.680
 We could talk about liquid biopsies aside

11:04.680 --> 11:06.560
 because those aren't really biomarker studies,

11:06.560 --> 11:08.380
 but put that away.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.700
 On the neurodegenerative side,

11:10.700 --> 11:12.200
 I don't think we have a lot of insight

11:12.200 --> 11:14.680
 that comes to understanding Parkinson's disease,

11:14.680 --> 11:15.920
 but when it comes to dementia,

11:15.920 --> 11:17.200
 particularly the Alzheimer's disease,

11:17.200 --> 11:18.800
 which is the most prevalent form of dementia,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.000
 I think the biomarkers can be quite helpful.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.560
 They overlap a lot with the atherosclerotic diseases.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.560
 So the same things that drive the risk of heart disease

11:26.560 --> 11:28.660
 are driving the risk of dementia.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.080
 And then there's some novel stuff as well.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.400
 If you include genetic testing,

11:32.400 --> 11:34.000
 which you can get out of a blood test,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.800
 we get a whole suite of genes, not just APOE,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.120
 but far more nuanced stuff than that

11:39.120 --> 11:40.700
 that can also play a role.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.860
 So you can stratify risk in that sense.

11:42.860 --> 11:46.920
 So in aggregate, I would say blood testing of biomarkers

11:47.920 --> 11:51.760
 provides pretty good insight into lifespan.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.800
 When you get into healthspan,

11:52.800 --> 11:56.760
 you have kind of the cognitive, physical, emotional domains.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.440
 I think here the biomarkers are far less helpful,

11:59.440 --> 12:03.220
 and here we kind of rely more on functional testing.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.300
 So when it comes to sort of the cognitive piece,

12:06.300 --> 12:08.280
 you can do cognitive testing.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.600
 In terms of long-term risk,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.560
 a lot of the things that imply good cognitive health

12:12.560 --> 12:16.280
 as you age are in line with the same things

12:16.280 --> 12:19.560
 that you would do to reduce the risk of dementia.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.760
 So all the biomarkers that you would look to improve

12:22.760 --> 12:24.160
 through dementia risk reduction,

12:24.160 --> 12:26.700
 you would be improving through cognitive health.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.880
 On the physical side, I mean,

12:27.880 --> 12:29.400
 outside of looking at hormone levels and things,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.020
 which we look at extensively,

12:31.020 --> 12:34.140
 and understanding how those might aid in

12:34.140 --> 12:37.480
 or prevent some of the metrics that matter,

12:37.480 --> 12:40.120
 it really is, this is a biomarker aside thing.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.200
 I mean, I'd be much more interested

12:41.200 --> 12:45.660
 in a person's DEXA, CPET testing, VO2 max testing,

12:45.660 --> 12:48.720
 zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation,

12:48.720 --> 12:51.040
 those what I would consider more functional tests

12:51.040 --> 12:53.320
 that give me far more insight into that.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.560
 And then of course the emotional piece,

12:54.560 --> 12:56.920
 which depending on who you are,

12:56.920 --> 12:58.360
 might be the single most important piece

12:58.360 --> 12:59.800
 without which none of this other stuff matters,

12:59.800 --> 13:01.940
 right, if you're a totally miserable human being,

13:01.940 --> 13:03.800
 your relationships suck.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.460
 I don't think any of this other stuff matters.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.800
 And certainly there's nothing that I'm looking at

13:07.800 --> 13:10.820
 in biomarkers that's giving me great insight into that.

13:10.820 --> 13:12.480
 Do you ask about emotional state

13:12.480 --> 13:14.640
 or do you try and assess emotional state indirectly

13:14.640 --> 13:17.080
 when you do an intake with one of your patients?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.420
 Probably not so much in the intake

13:19.420 --> 13:20.760
 because I think it takes a while

13:20.760 --> 13:22.220
 to form a relationship with a patient

13:22.220 --> 13:24.920
 before that starts to become something

13:24.920 --> 13:27.400
 that they're necessarily gonna wanna talk with you about.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.360
 But I definitely think of it

13:29.360 --> 13:31.760
 as an important part of what we do.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.820
 And I think without it,

13:33.820 --> 13:35.560
 none of this other stuff really matters.

13:35.560 --> 13:38.200
 Again, the irony of thinking about

13:38.200 --> 13:39.960
 how many years I spent sort of in pursuit

13:39.960 --> 13:43.640
 of fully optimizing every detail of everything

13:43.640 --> 13:46.580
 without any attention being paid to that dimension

13:46.580 --> 13:48.000
 is not lost on me.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.680
 And look, there are some patients who,

13:50.680 --> 13:51.760
 that's just not something that,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.240
 that's something that's compartmentalized.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.120
 Maybe they're doing well in that department

13:55.120 --> 13:55.960
 or maybe they aren't,

13:55.960 --> 13:58.840
 but they just aren't willing to engage on that yet.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.840
 In terms of frequency of blood testing,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.200
 if somebody feels pretty good

14:03.200 --> 14:05.340
 and is taking a number of steps,

14:05.340 --> 14:07.240
 exercise, nutrition, et cetera,

14:07.240 --> 14:11.960
 to try and extend lifespan and improve health span,

14:13.640 --> 14:16.720
 is once a year frequent enough?

14:16.720 --> 14:20.000
 And should a 20-year-old start getting blood work done

14:20.000 --> 14:21.720
 just to get a window into what's going on,

14:21.720 --> 14:22.780
 assuming that they can afford it

14:22.780 --> 14:24.240
 or their insurance can cover it?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.080
 Yeah, I mean, look,

14:25.080 --> 14:27.560
 I certainly think everybody should be screened early in life

14:27.560 --> 14:31.200
 because if you look at like what's the single most prevalent

14:31.200 --> 14:34.520
 genetic driver of atherosclerosis is Lp little a.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.100
 So unfortunately, most physicians don't know

14:36.100 --> 14:37.080
 what Lp little a is,

14:37.080 --> 14:40.020
 and yet somewhere between 8 and 12% of the population

14:40.020 --> 14:40.880
 has a high enough,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.080
 and depending on who you,

14:43.200 --> 14:44.640
 I had a recent guest on my podcast

14:44.640 --> 14:46.760
 who suggested it could be as high as 20%

14:46.760 --> 14:48.120
 have a high enough Lp little a

14:48.120 --> 14:51.080
 that it is contributing to atherosclerosis.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.920
 So to not want to know that

14:52.920 --> 14:54.300
 when it's genetically determined, right?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.680
 This is something that you're born with this

14:56.680 --> 14:59.240
 and you only need to really check it once.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.480
 Why we wouldn't want to know that in a 20-year-old

15:01.480 --> 15:02.680
 when it can contribute

15:02.680 --> 15:06.200
 to a lot of the early atherosclerosis we see in people.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.440
 It's leaving money on the table, in my opinion.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.960
 The frequency with which you need to test

15:11.960 --> 15:16.120
 really comes down to the state of interventions.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.080
 I don't think it makes sense to just do blood tests

15:18.080 --> 15:19.200
 for the sake of doing blood tests.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.400
 There has to be kind of a reason.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.560
 Is something changing?

15:21.560 --> 15:26.080
 A blood test is, for the most part, a static intervention.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.840
 It's a look at a window in time,

15:28.840 --> 15:32.680
 and there's benefit in having a few of those

15:32.680 --> 15:36.200
 over the course of a year if you're unsure about a level.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.600
 So if something comes back and it doesn't look great,

15:38.600 --> 15:40.200
 yeah, it might make sense just to recheck it

15:40.200 --> 15:41.800
 without reacting to it.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.320
 But typically, in patients,

15:43.320 --> 15:45.580
 we might check blood two to four times a year,

15:45.580 --> 15:47.620
 but we're also probably doing things in there

15:47.620 --> 15:52.160
 to now check, like, hey, we gave this drug.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.760
 Did it have the desired outcome?

15:54.760 --> 15:56.600
 You put on three pounds of muscle

15:56.600 --> 15:57.880
 and lost three pounds of fat.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.480
 Did it have the desired outcome?

16:01.240 --> 16:06.200
 Speaking of tracking weight and fat lean mass percentages,

16:06.200 --> 16:07.960
 is that something that you recommend

16:07.960 --> 16:09.460
 your patients do pretty often?

16:09.460 --> 16:10.960
 I know people that step on the scale every day.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.000
 I know people like myself that, frankly,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.680
 I might step on the scale three times a year.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.240
 I don't really care.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.600
 I pay attention to other things

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
 that are far more subjective.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.920
 Maybe I'm making a huge mistake.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.160
 What are your thoughts about quantitative measurements

16:24.160 --> 16:29.160
 of weight BMI for the typical person?

16:29.320 --> 16:31.720
 I think they're pretty crude.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.920
 I think a DEXA, I'd rather take a DEXA annually

16:37.120 --> 16:40.380
 and then maybe follow weight a little bit more closely

16:40.380 --> 16:41.380
 to get a sense of it.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.920
 And so with a DEXA, you're getting,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.480
 at least the way we look at the data,

16:45.480 --> 16:47.520
 four pieces of information.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.520
 Now, most people, when they do a DEXA,

16:49.520 --> 16:50.800
 should I explain what that is?

16:50.800 --> 16:53.080
 Yeah, I think some people might not know what DEXA is.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.660
 In fact, I confess I have a crude understanding

16:55.660 --> 16:56.500
 of what it is.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.800
 Tell me where I'm wrong

16:58.800 --> 17:02.040
 and hopefully where I'm at least partially right.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.760
 My understanding is that there are a number of different ways

17:03.760 --> 17:07.080
 to measure lean mass to non-lean mass ratio.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.520
 And there's one where they put you underwater.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.340
 There's one where they put you

17:10.340 --> 17:12.880
 into some sort of non-underwater chamber.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.340
 There's calipering.

17:14.340 --> 17:16.680
 And then there's the looking in the mirror

17:16.680 --> 17:19.380
 and pinching and changing the lighting.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.440
 It's funny, if you've done it enough,

17:23.440 --> 17:26.720
 I can sort of tell my body fat by my abs, right?

17:26.720 --> 17:29.440
 So I can sort of tell by how good the six pack

17:29.440 --> 17:31.620
 or how bad the six pack is, what the leanness is.

17:31.620 --> 17:34.440
 And that's actually not a terrible way to do it.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.040
 A bodybuilder, for example, which I've never been,

17:37.040 --> 17:41.480
 can tell you the difference between being 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%,

17:41.480 --> 17:46.480
 just based on the degree of visibility within the abs.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.720
 But basically a DEXA scan is an X-ray.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.740
 So it's the same principle as just getting a chest X-ray

17:53.740 --> 17:56.600
 where ionizing radiation is passed through the body

17:56.600 --> 17:58.080
 and there's a plate behind the body

17:58.080 --> 17:59.820
 that collects what comes through.

17:59.820 --> 18:02.720
 And the denser the medium

18:02.720 --> 18:05.420
 that the electrons are trying to go through,

18:05.420 --> 18:06.840
 the less of them that are collected.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.000
 So when you look at an X-ray,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.760
 as everybody's probably seen an X-ray,

18:09.760 --> 18:11.780
 that which is white is most dense.

18:11.780 --> 18:14.280
 So if you had a piece of metal in your pocket,

18:14.280 --> 18:16.760
 it would show up as a bright white thing.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.560
 That's why ribs and bones show up as white.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.960
 And the things that are the least dense,

18:21.960 --> 18:25.320
 like the lungs where it's just air, are the blackest.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.600
 And everything is a shade of gray in between.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.560
 So a DEXA is just doing that effectively,

18:30.560 --> 18:31.800
 but it's a moving X-ray.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.840
 So you lay down on a bed and it takes maybe 10 minutes

18:34.840 --> 18:37.360
 and this little very low power X-ray

18:37.360 --> 18:39.160
 kind of goes over your body.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.460
 And the plate beneath it is collecting information

18:43.460 --> 18:45.960
 that is basically allowing it to differentiate

18:45.960 --> 18:47.760
 between three things.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.440
 Bone mineral content, fat, other.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.480
 And the other is quantified as lean body mass.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.620
 So that's organs, muscles, everything else.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.680
 So when most people do a DEXA,

19:00.680 --> 19:02.800
 they get the report back and the reports are horrible.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.700
 I've yet to see one company that can do this

19:04.700 --> 19:06.840
 in a way that isn't abjectly horrible.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.320
 We've created our own templates.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.940
 We have our own dashboard for how we do this

19:09.940 --> 19:12.340
 because we've just given up on trying to use theirs.

19:12.340 --> 19:13.520
 But the first thing most people look at

19:13.520 --> 19:14.800
 is what's my body fat?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.960
 And this is the gold standard outside of like MRI

19:17.960 --> 19:20.000
 or something that's only used for research purposes.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
 So a DEXA is going to produce a far better estimate

19:23.000 --> 19:27.460
 of body fat than calipers or buoyancy testing

19:27.460 --> 19:29.760
 or things like that, provided the machinery

19:29.760 --> 19:32.700
 is well calibrated and the operator knows how to use it.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.200
 I've heard some people argue that in the hands

19:36.200 --> 19:40.600
 of the guy who's been doing calipers his whole life,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.440
 it could probably be comparable with calipers.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.720
 But nevertheless, for an off the shelf tech,

19:45.720 --> 19:46.680
 DEXA is amazing.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.560
 Of the four things that get spit out of the DEXA,

19:50.560 --> 19:53.380
 we think that the body fat is the least interesting.

19:53.380 --> 19:56.120
 And so I would rank that as fourth on the list

19:56.120 --> 19:58.020
 of what's germane to your health.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.920
 The other three things that you get spit out

19:59.920 --> 20:03.960
 are bone mineral density, visceral fat,

20:03.960 --> 20:08.960
 and then the metrics that allow you to basically compute

20:09.160 --> 20:11.180
 what's called appendicular lean mass index

20:11.180 --> 20:12.920
 and fat free mass index.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.320
 And so those three metrics are significantly

20:15.320 --> 20:17.440
 more important than body fat.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
 And the reason is as follows, right?

20:19.440 --> 20:22.340
 So bone mineral density basically speaks

20:22.340 --> 20:26.280
 to your risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.840
 And that doesn't sound very sexy to people our age,

20:29.840 --> 20:31.740
 you know, 50 year old guys listening to this,

20:31.740 --> 20:32.720
 it's like, yeah, big deal.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.800
 But for a 50 year old woman, this is a huge deal, right?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.640
 A woman who's just about to go through menopause

20:37.640 --> 20:40.740
 or has just gone through menopause is at an enormous risk

20:40.740 --> 20:43.900
 for osteopenia and then ultimately osteoporosis.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.140
 Because estrogen is the single most important hormone

20:47.140 --> 20:50.060
 in regulating bone mineral density.

20:50.060 --> 20:51.960
 And we can come back and talk about why that's the case,

20:51.960 --> 20:55.080
 but it's very interesting how the biomechanics

20:55.080 --> 21:00.080
 of bones work and why estrogen specifically is so important.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.440
 And this is a huge cause of morbidity, right?

21:02.440 --> 21:05.120
 So, you know, if you're over the age of 65

21:05.120 --> 21:07.480
 and you fall and break your hip,

21:07.480 --> 21:12.480
 your one year morbidity is about 30 to 40%.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.800
 Which again, just to put that in English,

21:14.800 --> 21:17.120
 if you're 65 or older, you fall and break your hip,

21:17.120 --> 21:20.420
 there's a 30 to 40% chance you're dead in a year.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.260
 Wow.

21:21.260 --> 21:22.100
 Bones matter.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.960
 So we want to really get a sense of where you stack up

21:27.960 --> 21:31.440
 for your age, for your sex, and if you're anywhere

21:31.440 --> 21:34.880
 off the pace, we have to ramp up our strategy

21:34.880 --> 21:37.440
 and be super aggressive about how to increase that

21:37.440 --> 21:41.360
 or at a minimum, prevent any further decay.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.040
 And are there age related charts for these sorts of things?

21:44.040 --> 21:47.140
 Yeah, this all gets spit out into what's called a z-score.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.440
 So when you're looking at your BMD,

21:49.440 --> 21:50.560
 it's gonna give you a z-score.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.160
 So a z-score of zero means, and you understand this,

21:54.160 --> 21:56.760
 but it's z-score referring to a probability distribution

21:56.760 --> 21:57.680
 in a standard mode.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.440
 So z-score of zero means you're at the 50th percentile

22:00.440 --> 22:01.480
 for your age and sex.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.200
 A z-score of plus one, your one standard deviation above,

22:04.200 --> 22:06.320
 minus one below, et cetera.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.800
 There's also a t-score, which is doing the same thing,

22:08.800 --> 22:11.600
 but comparing you to a young person.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.200
 And so the t-score is technically used to make the diagnosis

22:14.200 --> 22:15.800
 of osteopenia or osteoporosis.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.160
 We tend to look more at the z-score and basically say,

22:18.160 --> 22:22.560
 look, if your z-score right now is minus one in four years,

22:22.560 --> 22:24.120
 I want your z-score to be zero.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.440
 Not necessarily because you've increased that entire way,

22:27.440 --> 22:29.160
 but maybe you've increased slightly

22:29.160 --> 22:31.960
 while it's expected that you would have declined.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.800
 I see.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.200
 What are some things that we can do

22:35.200 --> 22:38.920
 to improve bone mineral density at any age?

22:38.920 --> 22:41.440
 So it turns out there's a real critical window

22:41.440 --> 22:43.080
 in which we are malleable.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.280
 So depending on the age at which someone's listening

22:45.280 --> 22:50.280
 to us discuss this, if you're under 20, 25,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.800
 you are still in that time of your life

22:52.800 --> 22:55.560
 when you are able to reach your potential.

22:55.560 --> 23:00.040
 So it turns out that strength training is probably

23:00.040 --> 23:02.320
 the single best thing you can do.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.800
 And this was a surprise to me,

23:03.800 --> 23:07.400
 because we did an AMA on this topic a little while ago,

23:07.400 --> 23:10.760
 and that's when I got really deep on this with our analysts.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.280
 My assumption was running must be the best.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.960
 Some sort of impact must be the best thing you can do.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.680
 I assumed running would be better than swimming and cycling,

23:18.680 --> 23:20.160
 but it turned out that powerlifting

23:20.160 --> 23:22.800
 was probably the best thing you could do.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.240
 And I think once you understand how bones work,

23:25.240 --> 23:27.520
 it became more clear, which is,

23:27.520 --> 23:30.480
 powerlifting is really putting more of a shear force

23:30.480 --> 23:33.160
 from the muscle via the tendon onto the bone.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.080
 And that's what the bones are really sensing.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.840
 They're sensing that shear force that's being applied

23:37.840 --> 23:39.760
 through the bone, in a compressive way,

23:39.760 --> 23:41.480
 depending on the bone, of course.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.360
 And that's what's basically activating the osteoblasts,

23:44.360 --> 23:49.360
 which are the cells that are allowing bone to be built.

23:49.360 --> 23:54.360
 So this turns out to be probably more important for females,

23:56.040 --> 23:59.280
 because how high you can get

23:59.280 --> 24:00.720
 during that period of development,

24:00.720 --> 24:02.600
 say till you're 20 or 25,

24:02.600 --> 24:05.640
 basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your life.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.480
 So where we get into real trouble is with patients who,

24:08.480 --> 24:12.220
 for example, used large amounts of inhaled steroids

24:12.220 --> 24:13.120
 during that period of their life,

24:13.120 --> 24:15.360
 because let's say they had really bad asthma.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.200
 Or patients who needed large amounts of corticosteroids

24:18.200 --> 24:20.240
 for some other immune-related condition.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.140
 So during their critical window of development,

24:22.140 --> 24:25.660
 they were taking a drug that was impairing this process.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.960
 So we have some patients like that in our practice,

24:27.960 --> 24:30.200
 and that's just an enormous liability

24:30.200 --> 24:31.840
 that we're working really hard to overcome,

24:31.840 --> 24:35.900
 with nutrition, with hormones, with drugs, with training.

24:37.240 --> 24:41.000
 And it's just something you have to be aware of.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.640
 I wasn't aware that inhalants for asthma

24:45.640 --> 24:48.480
 and things of that sort can impair bone mineral density.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.080
 Yeah, they're steroid-based.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.800
 Some of them, of course, are just beta agonists,

24:51.800 --> 24:52.640
 and they're fine.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.720
 So anything corticosterone-like, interesting.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.400
 And then I always get asked this question,

24:57.400 --> 25:00.120
 and I always reflexively want to say no,

25:00.120 --> 25:02.760
 but I don't really know the answer, so I don't reply.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.520
 What about topical corticosterone?

25:05.520 --> 25:06.740
 People will put cortisone cream.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.520
 To me, it seems almost inconceivable

25:08.520 --> 25:09.900
 that it would have a systemic effect,

25:09.900 --> 25:11.480
 but then again, what do I know?

25:11.480 --> 25:14.320
 It's all docent and time-related.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.040
 So if you're talking about like,

25:16.040 --> 25:17.960
 I've got a little rash under my skin,

25:17.960 --> 25:20.400
 I'm gonna put corticosteroids on, probably not.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.620
 But certainly with enough of it put on,

25:23.620 --> 25:26.920
 I mean, it is absorbed, so it could be an issue.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.080
 But that's not typically what we're concerned with.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.560
 I mean, we're mostly concerned with people

25:30.560 --> 25:33.440
 that are taking even modest amounts of prednisone

25:33.440 --> 25:35.100
 for months, years at a time,

25:36.100 --> 25:39.880
 or like I said, kids that are using steroid inhalers

25:39.880 --> 25:42.520
 for years and years and years.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.120
 Again, I'm not suggesting that if your kid's

25:44.120 --> 25:45.640
 on a steroid inhaler, they shouldn't be.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.660
 You have to solve the most important problem,

25:47.660 --> 25:49.760
 and if asthma is the most important problem, so be it.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.640
 I think you just want to turn that into,

25:51.640 --> 25:54.760
 okay, well, how much more imperative is it

25:54.760 --> 25:57.480
 that our kid is doing things that are putting

25:57.480 --> 25:59.920
 a high amount of stress on their bones

25:59.920 --> 26:01.720
 and via their muscles to make sure

26:01.720 --> 26:05.000
 that they're in that maximal capacity to build?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.200
 Do you think that somebody in their 30s or 40s or 50s

26:08.200 --> 26:09.920
 could still benefit from strength training

26:09.920 --> 26:13.240
 in terms of bone mineral density and longevity

26:13.240 --> 26:15.760
 as it relates to bone mineral density,

26:15.760 --> 26:18.320
 given that there was this key window earlier,

26:18.320 --> 26:19.160
 they might've missed that window?

26:19.160 --> 26:21.100
 Oh yeah, no, no, this is essential for the rest of life

26:21.100 --> 26:23.320
 because you're now trying to prevent the fall off.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.720
 So basically the way it works is you're sort of,

26:25.720 --> 26:28.880
 from birth to say 20, you're in growth.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.200
 From 20 to 50, you plateau.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.780
 At 50, men start to decline, but it's really small.

26:34.780 --> 26:36.880
 Women start to decline, and it's precipitous.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.760
 And it's related to the drop in estrogen

26:38.760 --> 26:40.880
 associated with menopause or pre-menopause?

26:40.880 --> 26:41.720
 Correct.

26:41.720 --> 26:46.120
 And can we get into any of the broad contours

26:46.120 --> 26:47.840
 of what that strength training looks like?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.720
 We had Dr. Andy Galpin on the show.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.320
 He talked a lot about ways to build strength

26:51.320 --> 26:53.640
 versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.100
 I think there's pretty good agreement across the fields

26:56.100 --> 27:00.680
 of physiotherapy, et cetera, of physiology and medicine

27:00.680 --> 27:01.500
 in terms of how to do that.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.620
 But my understanding is fairly low repetition ranges.

27:04.620 --> 27:07.680
 So this is anywhere from one to six repetitions,

27:07.680 --> 27:11.960
 typically not aiming for a pump hypertrophy,

27:11.960 --> 27:14.640
 that sort of thing, but heavy loads that are hard to move.

27:14.640 --> 27:18.020
 80% of one repetition maximum or more

27:18.020 --> 27:19.620
 done with long rest periods,

27:21.840 --> 27:24.000
 two to three times a week type thing.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.840
 Is that about right?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.760
 Yeah, if you look at the literature on this,

27:26.760 --> 27:28.080
 it's going to tell you,

27:28.080 --> 27:31.440
 it's going to differentiate powerlifting from weightlifting.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.360
 In other words, yeah, you do need to be kind of moving

27:34.360 --> 27:36.480
 against a very heavy load.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.820
 Now, again, that can look very different

27:37.820 --> 27:40.480
 depending on your level of experience.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.280
 I really like deadlifting.

27:42.280 --> 27:45.280
 Now, I can count the number of days left in my life

27:45.280 --> 27:48.300
 when I'm going to want to do sets over 400 pounds,

27:48.300 --> 27:51.280
 but I'll pick and choose the days that I do.

27:51.280 --> 27:54.000
 But I grew up doing those things.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.560
 I'm comfortable with those movements.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.600
 If I had a 60-year-old woman who's never lifted weights

27:58.600 --> 28:00.920
 in her life who we now have to get lifting,

28:02.400 --> 28:03.700
 we could get her to deadlift,

28:03.700 --> 28:07.800
 but I think I wouldn't make perfect the enemy of good.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.760
 I'd be happy to put her on a leg press machine

28:09.760 --> 28:11.200
 and just get her doing that.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.000
 It's not as pure a movement as a deadlift, but who cares?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.560
 We can still put her at a heavy load for her

28:18.560 --> 28:19.760
 and do so safely.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.520
 Now, that said, there was a study that was done in Australia

28:24.520 --> 28:27.600
 and hopefully we can find a link to it.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.120
 There's a video on YouTube that actually kind of has the PI

28:30.120 --> 28:31.480
 sort of walking through the results.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.520
 I could send it to you.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.360
 And it's just amazing.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.040
 They took a group of older women.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.640
 They looked like they were in their 60s or 70s

28:37.640 --> 28:39.320
 who had never lifted weights in their life,

28:39.320 --> 28:41.040
 who had osteopenia,

28:41.040 --> 28:43.120
 and some probably already had osteoporosis.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.120
 And they basically just put them

28:44.120 --> 28:45.680
 on a strength training protocol.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.720
 And it is remarkable to watch these women.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.980
 They're doing good mornings.

28:48.980 --> 28:49.820
 They're doing deadlifts.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.920
 They're picking heavy things up off the ground.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.660
 I think one woman was picking up,

28:54.640 --> 28:58.740
 God, I want to say she was picking like 50, 60 kilos up

28:58.740 --> 28:59.840
 off the ground.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.560
 I mean, just staggering sums of weight

29:01.560 --> 29:03.600
 for these women who have never done anything.

29:03.600 --> 29:07.320
 And their bone health is improving at this age.

29:07.320 --> 29:12.320
 So the goal, frankly, is to just never get to the point

29:12.600 --> 29:16.200
 where you have to do this for the first time.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.960
 Strength training is such an essential part of our existence

29:18.960 --> 29:22.420
 that it's never too late to start,

29:22.420 --> 29:24.560
 but you should never stop.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.400
 I love that advice.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.480
 Is it a systemic effect or a local effect?

29:27.480 --> 29:30.660
 So for instance, let's say that,

29:30.660 --> 29:32.820
 well, my mother is in her late 70s.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.760
 She actually used to be really strong when we were kids.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.740
 She could move this fish tank that was in my room

29:37.740 --> 29:39.000
 long before I could move it.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.640
 And she's really strong.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.920
 Over the years, I wouldn't call her frail by any means,

29:44.920 --> 29:46.800
 but I certainly think she could benefit

29:46.800 --> 29:48.940
 from some strength training.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.200
 Let's say she were to start doing some leg presses

29:51.200 --> 29:52.760
 or start even with air squats

29:52.760 --> 29:55.040
 and maybe work up to some pushups.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.080
 Are the effects all local?

29:56.080 --> 29:58.360
 Meaning if she were to just train her legs

29:58.360 --> 30:01.600
 or just do pushups, would it only be the loads

30:01.600 --> 30:04.580
 applied to the limbs and muscles and tissues

30:04.580 --> 30:05.420
 that were involved?

30:05.420 --> 30:07.240
 I think that's where the bulk of it is, yeah.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.120
 So you need to train the whole body, essentially.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.260
 Yeah, now keep in mind,

30:10.260 --> 30:12.960
 the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis

30:12.960 --> 30:15.640
 is based on only three locations,

30:15.640 --> 30:18.200
 the left hip, the right hip, and the lumbar spine.

30:18.200 --> 30:22.000
 So that's just the convention

30:22.000 --> 30:24.240
 by which we make the diagnosis.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.880
 And I think part of that has to do with

30:25.880 --> 30:27.960
 that's where the majority of the insults occur.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.400
 Now, not all of the insults.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.460
 I've seen people that have,

30:31.460 --> 30:33.160
 because of horrible bone density,

30:33.160 --> 30:36.780
 they're fracturing ankles and tibia, fibula,

30:36.780 --> 30:39.960
 like they're having low-tib fib fractures just walking.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.320
 So clearly bone density outside of those regions

30:42.320 --> 30:46.200
 does matter, but much of it is really focused on,

30:46.200 --> 30:48.000
 and by the way, you fall, you break a wrist.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.040
 So this is a systemic issue,

30:51.040 --> 30:54.160
 but the majority of the response is a local response

30:54.160 --> 30:56.920
 because it really comes down to putting a load

30:56.920 --> 31:00.080
 directly on that bone and then having that bone in kind

31:00.080 --> 31:03.100
 respond by laying down more bone.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.320
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

31:05.320 --> 31:07.420
 I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,

31:07.420 --> 31:10.640
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.880
 Athletic Greens, aka AG1,

31:12.880 --> 31:15.360
 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink

31:15.360 --> 31:18.400
 that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.120
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,

31:21.120 --> 31:23.560
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.160
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

31:25.160 --> 31:28.120
 and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day

31:28.120 --> 31:31.020
 is that it supplies total foundational coverage

31:31.020 --> 31:32.420
 of my vitamin, mineral needs,

31:32.420 --> 31:35.360
 and it supplies important nutrients that I need

31:35.360 --> 31:36.920
 to support my gut microbiome.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.640
 The gut microbiome, as many of you know,

31:38.640 --> 31:39.760
 supports the immune system.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.800
 It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,

31:41.800 --> 31:44.160
 which is vital for mood, for energy levels,

31:44.160 --> 31:46.480
 for regulating focus, and many other features

31:46.480 --> 31:47.960
 of our mental health and physical health

31:47.960 --> 31:50.480
 that impact our daily performance and high performance

31:50.480 --> 31:52.600
 in any endeavors we might be involved in.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.000
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.680
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

31:56.680 --> 31:58.280
 and claim a special offer.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.960
 They're giving away five free travel packs

31:59.960 --> 32:03.840
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.080
 And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital

32:06.080 --> 32:08.160
 for all sorts of things like hormone health

32:08.160 --> 32:10.560
 and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health

32:10.560 --> 32:11.740
 and calcium regulation.

32:11.740 --> 32:14.960
 Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

32:14.960 --> 32:16.680
 to claim that special offer.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.840
 You mentioned falling and the problems with falling

32:18.840 --> 32:21.800
 and breaking things and mortality related to that.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.060
 I wonder whether or not there are also

32:24.060 --> 32:26.920
 health-related effects of just having weak bones

32:26.920 --> 32:29.480
 that are not just about falling and breaking a bone

32:29.480 --> 32:31.460
 and dying a year later.

32:31.460 --> 32:33.720
 Even though that's obviously very severe,

32:33.720 --> 32:35.000
 because I think when people hear about that,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.360
 some people might think, well, I'll just be more careful.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.300
 I'll just move more slowly.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.880
 I'll sit in a wheelchair if I need to,

32:40.880 --> 32:42.280
 even though I might be able to walk

32:42.280 --> 32:43.440
 if it keeps me from falling.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.580
 Some people, I think, adopt that mentality.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.040
 What are some of the benefits of having

32:49.040 --> 32:51.840
 high bone mineral density for men and women

32:51.840 --> 32:55.880
 that are perhaps independent of risk of injury?

32:55.880 --> 32:57.180
 Well, I think it's actually the inverse

32:57.180 --> 32:58.240
 of what you just said, right?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.680
 It's sort of like, you have to sort of

33:01.900 --> 33:04.600
 be able to articulate what it is you want

33:04.600 --> 33:05.740
 in your marginal decade.

33:05.740 --> 33:07.420
 So we use this thing in our practice

33:07.420 --> 33:08.800
 called the marginal decade.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.880
 Marginal decade is the last decade of your life.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.800
 So everyone will have a marginal decade.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.000
 That's the only thing I can tell you

33:14.000 --> 33:16.420
 with absolute certainty, right?

33:16.420 --> 33:17.260
 I believe you.

33:17.260 --> 33:18.600
 There's no immortality.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.720
 There's no hidden elixir that's gonna help us live

33:20.720 --> 33:22.200
 to be, you know, whatever.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.480
 I mean, we're all gonna be in our last decade at some point.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.280
 And outside of people who die suddenly

33:28.280 --> 33:31.320
 or through an accident, most of us know

33:31.320 --> 33:33.000
 when we're in that marginal decade.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.520
 You might not know the day you enter it,

33:34.520 --> 33:37.840
 but most people who are old enough,

33:37.840 --> 33:39.800
 if you tell them, are you in the last decade of your life?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.960
 They probably have a sense that they are.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.940
 So I think the exercise that we like to go through

33:44.940 --> 33:47.560
 with our patients very early on

33:47.560 --> 33:51.700
 is have them in exquisite detail,

33:51.700 --> 33:53.320
 more detail than they've ever considered.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.140
 So we have to prompt them with like 50 questions,

33:57.040 --> 34:00.620
 lay out what their marginal decade should look like.

34:00.620 --> 34:01.460
 Wow.

34:01.460 --> 34:02.720
 That's a serious exercise.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.220
 It's a very serious exercise, right?

34:04.220 --> 34:06.840
 Like what, tell me everything that is going to happen

34:06.840 --> 34:07.680
 in your marginal decade.

34:07.680 --> 34:08.760
 I don't know when it's gonna be, Andrew.

34:08.760 --> 34:12.440
 It could be 87 to 97 if we're doing well, right?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.040
 It might be 79 to 89.

34:14.040 --> 34:14.880
 I don't know.

34:14.880 --> 34:19.520
 But it would really be a very nuanced

34:19.520 --> 34:21.660
 exploration of that topic.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.700
 And I think until you do that,

34:23.700 --> 34:26.720
 all of this other stuff is just abstract

34:26.720 --> 34:28.680
 and kind of nonsense.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.760
 You know, until a person can tell you

34:30.760 --> 34:34.760
 what it is that they want to be doing in that last decade,

34:34.760 --> 34:37.940
 you can't design a program to get them there.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.000
 I mean, think about it.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.800
 You know, someone wants to do an Ironman,

34:41.800 --> 34:44.880
 we take it for granted that we know what the objective is.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.520
 I have to be able to swim two and a half miles.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.480
 I have to be able to get out, take my wetsuit off,

34:48.480 --> 34:51.760
 hop on my bike, ride 112 miles, get off my bike,

34:51.760 --> 34:53.520
 take the bike shoes off, put the run shoes on,

34:53.520 --> 34:55.120
 run 26.2 miles, like we get it.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.480
 We know what the objective is.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.960
 And only by knowing that can you train.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.480
 Can you imagine if I said to you,

35:01.480 --> 35:03.600
 Andrew, I'm going to have you do an athletic event

35:03.600 --> 35:05.580
 in a year, start training.

35:05.580 --> 35:08.440
 I'm not gonna tell you what it is, just do it.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.440
 It could be playing basketball.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.840
 You know, it could be swimming to Catalina Island.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.120
 It could be running a hundred miles.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.260
 You wouldn't be able to do it.

35:16.260 --> 35:18.760
 So similarly, if we don't know what our marginal decade

35:18.760 --> 35:22.200
 is meant to be, there's no way to train for it.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.440
 Do you think this is a good exercise for anyone

35:24.440 --> 35:26.880
 and everyone to do on their own, regardless of age here?

35:26.880 --> 35:28.600
 I'm hearing this and I'm thinking,

35:28.600 --> 35:31.320
 I need to think about when my last decade might be

35:31.320 --> 35:33.120
 and what I want that to look like.

35:33.120 --> 35:33.960
 Absolutely.

35:33.960 --> 35:34.920
 I mean, when I say we do it with our patients,

35:34.920 --> 35:36.620
 that's only because that's the population I work with,

35:36.620 --> 35:37.880
 but there's simply no reason

35:37.880 --> 35:40.120
 everybody shouldn't be going through this exercise.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.080
 And then you sort of back script from there,

35:43.080 --> 35:44.200
 figure out what people should be doing

35:44.200 --> 35:45.560
 given their current health status.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.280
 Exactly right, we call it backcasting.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.580
 So the first step we do is once we've really delineated

35:50.580 --> 35:53.520
 what the objective function looks like, we then say,

35:53.520 --> 35:56.220
 okay, how do you break down that

35:56.220 --> 36:00.200
 into metrics that we can measure?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.600
 So, you know, you described doing a whole bunch of things.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.440
 Okay, just to let you know, to do that will require

36:05.440 --> 36:09.240
 a VO2 max of 30 milliliters of oxygen

36:09.240 --> 36:11.160
 per minute per kilogram.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.080
 And the person will say, okay, what does that mean?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.400
 We'll say, well, that's a measure

36:15.400 --> 36:18.320
 of your maximal uptake of oxygen.

36:18.320 --> 36:22.840
 And that declines at about 8% to 10% per decade.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.960
 So if you have to be at 30,

36:24.960 --> 36:27.660
 and let's just assume you're gonna be doing that at 90,

36:27.660 --> 36:31.000
 so what do you need to be at 80, 70, 60, 50?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.180
 Okay, here's what it would need to be at 50.

36:33.180 --> 36:34.520
 Okay, what are you now?

36:34.520 --> 36:36.040
 Ah, there's a big gap.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.280
 You're below where you need to be now.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.680
 So you're obviously higher than 30 now,

36:40.680 --> 36:42.900
 but if you're only at 42 now,

36:42.900 --> 36:45.920
 and you need to be at 30 in 40 years,

36:45.920 --> 36:47.100
 you're not gonna cut it.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.680
 You have to be a lot fitter.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.640
 Okay, now let's do the same exercise

36:50.640 --> 36:52.880
 around strength and stability.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.840
 And without exception, most people,

36:54.840 --> 36:56.460
 when they do this exercise, will find out

36:56.460 --> 36:58.860
 they're well below where they need to be.

36:58.860 --> 37:03.860
 So the gravity of aging is more vicious than people realize,

37:04.360 --> 37:06.360
 and therefore the height of your glider

37:06.360 --> 37:08.880
 needs to be much higher than you think it is

37:08.880 --> 37:12.440
 when you're our age if you wanna be able to do the things

37:12.440 --> 37:15.100
 we probably wanna be able to do when we're 90.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.120
 I absolutely love this approach.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.720
 I've never done it in terms of my health.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.200
 I've always thought about what I wanna accomplish

37:20.200 --> 37:22.480
 in the next three to six months or next year or so.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.940
 And by the way, that's a great approach.

37:23.940 --> 37:24.880
 That's forecasting.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.160
 Forecasting is fantastic.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.260
 Forecasting is really good at short-term things.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.360
 It doesn't work for long-term things.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.840
 Long-term, you have to do backcasting.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.720
 This backcasting approach really appeals to me

37:35.720 --> 37:38.400
 because in my career, well, I never anticipate, excuse me,

37:38.400 --> 37:40.320
 I never anticipated I'd be podcasting,

37:41.320 --> 37:42.600
 but that's what I did.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.480
 At some point as an undergraduate, I looked,

37:44.480 --> 37:46.480
 professors, I'm like, that looks like a pretty good life.

37:46.480 --> 37:47.320
 They seem pretty happy.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.400
 I talked to a few of them and then I figured out

37:49.400 --> 37:50.600
 what I need to do at each stage

37:50.600 --> 37:53.800
 in order to get to that next rung on the ladder

37:53.800 --> 37:56.280
 and just kind of figured it out

37:56.280 --> 37:59.280
 in a backcasting kind of way, as you refer to it.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.960
 I think this is incredibly useful

38:00.960 --> 38:03.380
 because it puts all the questions about blood work

38:03.380 --> 38:04.480
 and how often to get blood work

38:04.480 --> 38:07.120
 and what to measure in a really nice context

38:07.120 --> 38:08.680
 that's highly individualized.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.960
 I've never heard of this before, so.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.740
 And I should give a nod to Annie Duke.

38:12.740 --> 38:15.800
 I used to always refer to this as reverse engineering,

38:15.800 --> 38:17.200
 but in Annie Duke's book,

38:17.200 --> 38:19.760
 she wrote about this exact thing and called it backcasting,

38:19.760 --> 38:22.320
 and I was like, I like the term backcasting better.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.480
 I think it's more intuitive than reverse engineering.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.960
 Yeah, there's a real genius to it,

38:25.960 --> 38:28.000
 and I think it, because it sets so many things

38:28.000 --> 38:30.800
 into the appropriate bins and trajectories.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.920
 I've heard you talk before about some of the prime movers

38:33.920 --> 38:38.400
 for longevity and all-risk mortality.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.280
 And I'd love for you to review a little bit of that for us.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.040
 I think we all know that we shouldn't smoke

38:44.040 --> 38:46.520
 because it's very likely that we'll die earlier

38:46.520 --> 38:48.520
 if we smoke nicotine.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.960
 I'm neither a marijuana nor a nicotine smoker,

38:50.960 --> 38:52.920
 so I feel unstable ground there,

38:52.920 --> 38:54.800
 but anytime we see smoking nowadays,

38:54.800 --> 38:56.400
 people really want to distinguish

38:56.400 --> 38:58.880
 between cannabis and nicotine.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.920
 So I am curious about any differences there

39:00.920 --> 39:05.920
 in terms of impact on longevity, but in that context,

39:06.400 --> 39:09.960
 what are the things that anyone and everyone can do,

39:09.960 --> 39:13.800
 should do to live longer, basically?

39:13.800 --> 39:14.640
 How long you got?

39:16.120 --> 39:16.960
 Well, you tell me.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.560
 You tell me.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.680
 I'd like to live to be,

39:20.680 --> 39:23.400
 I'd like my final decade to be between 90 and 100.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.720
 Oh, no, I meant how long do you, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.480
 And will we spend from now until you're 90

39:27.480 --> 39:28.320
 talking about this?

39:28.320 --> 39:29.240
 Well, there's a risk of that,

39:29.240 --> 39:30.960
 but top contour is fine.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.440
 I know you've done a lot of content on this

39:32.440 --> 39:33.760
 and we will give people links

39:33.760 --> 39:35.640
 to some of that more in-depth content,

39:35.640 --> 39:38.360
 but let's say we were on a short flight

39:38.360 --> 39:42.240
 from here to San Diego, we're in Los Angeles now,

39:42.240 --> 39:43.920
 and we've got takeoff and landing,

39:43.920 --> 39:45.640
 and we don't want to kink our neck too much

39:45.640 --> 39:46.480
 by doing this thing.

39:46.480 --> 39:50.200
 So if I just said, hey, give me the extended version

39:50.200 --> 39:53.280
 of the three by five card, what does that look like?

39:55.080 --> 39:56.840
 So let's start with a couple of the things

39:56.840 --> 39:58.400
 that you've already highlighted, so smoking.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.440
 How much does smoking increase your risk

40:00.440 --> 40:01.840
 of all-cause mortality?

40:01.840 --> 40:04.160
 And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM

40:04.160 --> 40:07.480
 or all-cause mortality is it's really agnostic

40:07.480 --> 40:10.680
 to how you die, and that doesn't always make sense.

40:10.680 --> 40:14.040
 I mean, if you're talking about a very specific intervention

40:14.040 --> 40:15.800
 like an anti-cancer therapeutic,

40:15.800 --> 40:17.800
 you really care about cancer-specific mortality

40:17.800 --> 40:19.840
 or heart-specific mortality,

40:19.840 --> 40:21.440
 but when we talk about these sort of broad things,

40:21.440 --> 40:22.800
 we like to talk about ACM.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.080
 So using smoking, smoking is approximately

40:26.080 --> 40:29.280
 a 40% increase in the risk of ACM.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.560
 And what does that translate to?

40:30.560 --> 40:35.080
 And that means I'm shortening my life by 40%?

40:35.080 --> 40:36.680
 No, it means at any point in time,

40:36.680 --> 40:39.720
 there's a 40% greater risk that you're going to die

40:39.720 --> 40:42.000
 relative to a non-smoker and a never-smoker.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.440
 Yeah, yeah, so it's important to distinguish.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.120
 It doesn't mean your lifespan is going to be 40% less.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.720
 It means at any point in time standing there,

40:47.720 --> 40:50.560
 your risk of death is 40% higher.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.340
 And by the way, that'll catch up with you, right?

40:52.340 --> 40:54.720
 At some point, that catches up.

40:54.720 --> 40:59.040
 High blood pressure, it's about a 20 to 25% increase

40:59.040 --> 41:01.160
 in all-cause mortality.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.440
 You take something really extreme

41:02.440 --> 41:04.200
 like end-stage kidney disease.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.520
 So these are patients that are on dialysis

41:06.520 --> 41:08.240
 waiting for an organ.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.400
 And again, there's a confounder there

41:09.400 --> 41:11.800
 because what's the underlying condition

41:11.800 --> 41:12.620
 that leads you to that?

41:12.620 --> 41:16.320
 It's profound hypertension, significant type 2 diabetes

41:16.320 --> 41:17.840
 that's been uncontrolled.

41:17.840 --> 41:18.680
 That's enormous.

41:18.680 --> 41:23.060
 That's about 175% increase in ACM.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.560
 So the hazard ratio is like 2.75.

41:26.840 --> 41:30.440
 Type 2 diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.240
 So 25% increase.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.680
 So now the question is like, how do you improve?

41:33.680 --> 41:35.680
 So what are the things that improve those?

41:35.680 --> 41:39.780
 So now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers

41:39.780 --> 41:40.620
 and other metrics.

41:40.620 --> 41:45.500
 So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass,

41:45.500 --> 41:47.800
 what is the improvement?

41:47.800 --> 41:49.120
 And it's pretty significant.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.580
 It's about 3x.

41:50.580 --> 41:53.360
 So if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass

41:53.360 --> 41:54.760
 people as they age,

41:54.760 --> 41:58.080
 the low muscle mass people have about a 3x hazard ratio

41:58.080 --> 42:01.140
 or a 200% increase in all-cause mortality.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.280
 Now, if you look at the data more carefully,

42:03.280 --> 42:07.600
 you realize that it's probably less the muscle mass

42:07.600 --> 42:09.280
 fully doing that,

42:09.280 --> 42:12.200
 and it's more the high association with strength.

42:12.200 --> 42:15.360
 And when you start to tease out strength,

42:15.360 --> 42:18.700
 you can realize that strength could be probably 3.5x

42:18.700 --> 42:19.620
 as a hazard ratio,

42:19.620 --> 42:24.180
 meaning about 250% greater risk

42:24.180 --> 42:26.640
 if you have low strength to high strength.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.200
 And high strength is the ability to move loads

42:29.200 --> 42:31.400
 at 80 to 90% of one repetition.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.920
 It's all defined by given studies.

42:32.920 --> 42:36.720
 So the most common things that are used are actually,

42:36.720 --> 42:39.260
 they're used for the purposes of experiments

42:39.260 --> 42:40.360
 that make it easy to do.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.120
 And I don't even think they're the best metrics.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.280
 So they're usually using like grip strength,

42:45.320 --> 42:49.380
 leg extensions, and like wall sits, squats,

42:49.380 --> 42:50.360
 things like that.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.020
 So how long can you sit in a squatted position

42:53.020 --> 42:54.640
 at 90 degrees without support

42:54.640 --> 42:56.840
 would be a great demonstration of quad strength,

42:56.840 --> 42:58.080
 a leg extension,

42:59.080 --> 43:00.880
 how much weight can you hold for how long

43:00.880 --> 43:03.320
 relative to body weight, things like that.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.980
 We have a whole strength program

43:04.980 --> 43:06.160
 that we do with our patients.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.240
 We have something called the SMA.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.840
 So it's the strength metrics assessment.

43:08.840 --> 43:13.840
 And we put them through 11 tests that are really difficult,

43:13.880 --> 43:14.960
 like a dead hang is one of them.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.640
 Like how long can you dead hang your body weight,

43:16.640 --> 43:17.640
 stuff like that.

43:17.640 --> 43:20.840
 So we're trying to be more granular in that insight,

43:20.840 --> 43:23.340
 but tie it back to these principles.

43:23.340 --> 43:25.360
 If you look at cardio respiratory fitness,

43:25.360 --> 43:26.880
 it's even more profound.

43:26.880 --> 43:30.680
 So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25%

43:30.680 --> 43:33.640
 for their age and sex in terms of VO2 max,

43:33.640 --> 43:36.240
 and you compare them to the people

43:36.240 --> 43:40.640
 that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile,

43:40.640 --> 43:43.280
 you're talking about a two X difference roughly

43:43.280 --> 43:45.920
 in the risk of ACM.

43:45.920 --> 43:50.040
 If you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%,

43:50.040 --> 43:53.160
 so you're talking about bottom quarter to the elite

43:53.160 --> 43:57.880
 for a given age, you're talking about five X,

43:57.880 --> 44:01.280
 400% difference in all cause mortality.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.360
 That's probably the single strongest association

44:03.360 --> 44:05.940
 I've seen for any modifiable behavior.

44:05.940 --> 44:06.780
 Incredible.

44:06.780 --> 44:08.960
 So when you say elite, these are people

44:08.960 --> 44:11.240
 that are running marathons at a pretty rapid clip?

44:11.240 --> 44:12.080
 Not necessarily.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.820
 It's just like what the VO2 max is for that.

44:13.820 --> 44:17.480
 Like my VO2 max would be in the elite for my age group.

44:17.480 --> 44:20.560
 My VO2 max, but again, I'm training very deliberately

44:20.560 --> 44:21.640
 to make sure that it's in that.

44:21.640 --> 44:24.840
 So I wouldn't consider myself elite at anything anymore,

44:24.840 --> 44:28.160
 but I still maintain a VO2 max that is elite for my age.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.280
 I consider you an elite physician

44:30.280 --> 44:33.520
 and possibly an end guy all around.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.360
 But true.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.800
 But in terms of, okay, so for the-

44:38.800 --> 44:40.000
 But the point is like you don't have to be

44:40.000 --> 44:41.960
 a world-class athlete to be elite here, yeah.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.560
 Got it.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.440
 So maybe we could talk a little bit about the specifics

44:45.440 --> 44:49.740
 around the training to get into the top two tiers there,

44:49.740 --> 44:52.700
 because it seems that those are enormous positive effects

44:52.700 --> 44:54.560
 of cardiovascular exercise,

44:54.560 --> 44:58.280
 far greater than the sorts of numbers that I see around,

44:58.280 --> 45:00.520
 let's just say supplement A or supplement B.

45:00.520 --> 45:01.560
 And that's, you know,

45:01.560 --> 45:03.900
 like this is my whole pet peeve in life, right?

45:03.900 --> 45:07.640
 It's like, I just can't get enough of the machinating

45:07.640 --> 45:11.400
 and arguing about this supplement versus that supplement.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.320
 And I feel like you shouldn't be having those arguments

45:15.320 --> 45:17.520
 until you have your exercise house in order.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.920
 You know, you shouldn't be arguing about

45:22.040 --> 45:24.060
 this nuance of your carnivore diet

45:24.060 --> 45:25.960
 versus this nuance of your paleo diet

45:25.960 --> 45:28.440
 versus this nuance of your vegan diet,

45:28.440 --> 45:31.860
 like until you can deadlift your body weight for 10 reps.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.700
 Like then you can come and talk about those things

45:33.700 --> 45:35.280
 or something like, let's just go up with some metrics.

45:35.280 --> 45:39.760
 Like until your VO2 max is at least to the 75th percentile

45:39.760 --> 45:42.280
 and you're able to dead hang for at least a minute

45:42.280 --> 45:44.160
 and you're able to wall sit for at least two,

45:44.160 --> 45:45.000
 like we could rattle off

45:45.000 --> 45:47.780
 a bunch of relatively low-hanging fruit.

45:48.840 --> 45:49.840
 I wish there was a rule that said,

45:49.840 --> 45:52.480
 like you couldn't talk about anything else, health related.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.880
 We can make that rule.

45:53.880 --> 45:54.840
 No one will listen to it.

45:54.840 --> 45:55.680
 I don't know about that.

45:55.680 --> 45:56.840
 We can make whatever rules we want.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.600
 We can call it Atiyah's rule.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.160
 One thing I've done before in this podcast

46:00.160 --> 46:02.000
 and on social media is just borrowing

46:02.000 --> 46:03.240
 from the tradition in science,

46:03.240 --> 46:05.080
 which is it's inappropriate to name something

46:05.080 --> 46:08.820
 after yourself unless you were a scientist before 1950.

46:08.820 --> 46:10.320
 But it's totally appropriate to name things

46:10.320 --> 46:11.160
 after other people's.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.480
 I'm going to call it Atiyah's rule

46:12.480 --> 46:15.360
 until you can do the following things.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.200
 Don't talk about supplements.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.200
 Please refrain from talking about supplements and nutrition.

46:18.200 --> 46:19.040
 There it is.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.000
 Hereafter, thought of, referred to,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.320
 and referenced as Atiyah's rule.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.640
 I coined the phrase, not him.

46:24.640 --> 46:28.000
 So there's no ego involved, but it is now Atiyah's rule.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.160
 Watch out, hashtag Atiyah's rule.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.360
 Oh God.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.360
 Wikipedia entered Atiyah's rule.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.280
 In all seriousness, and I am serious about that,

46:36.280 --> 46:37.840
 dead hang for about a minute.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.440
 Seems like a really good goal for a lot of people,

46:40.440 --> 46:41.280
 at least.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.120
 That's our goal.

46:42.120 --> 46:43.320
 I think we have a minute and a half

46:43.320 --> 46:45.000
 is the goal for a 40-year-old woman.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.820
 Two minutes is the goal for a 40-year-old man.

46:46.820 --> 46:51.460
 So we adjust them up and down based on age and gender.

46:51.460 --> 46:52.300
 Great.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.800
 And then the wall sit, what are some numbers?

46:53.800 --> 46:54.720
 We don't use a wall sit.

46:54.720 --> 46:58.820
 We do just a straight squat, air squat, at 90 degrees.

46:58.820 --> 47:01.040
 And I believe two minutes is the standard

47:01.040 --> 47:02.640
 for both men and women at 40.

47:02.640 --> 47:03.480
 Great.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.120
 And then, because for some people,

47:05.120 --> 47:07.360
 thinking in terms of EO2 max is a little more complicated.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.760
 They might not have access to the equipment

47:08.760 --> 47:10.580
 or to measure it, et cetera.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.520
 What can we talk about, think about

47:13.520 --> 47:14.560
 in terms of cardiovascular?

47:14.560 --> 47:17.200
 So run a mile at seven minutes or less,

47:17.200 --> 47:18.020
 eight minutes or less?

47:18.020 --> 47:18.860
 That's a good question.

47:18.860 --> 47:22.660
 So there are really good VO2 max estimators online,

47:22.660 --> 47:26.200
 and you can plug in your activity du jour.

47:26.200 --> 47:29.320
 So be it a bike, run, or rowing machine,

47:29.320 --> 47:31.440
 and it can give you a sense of that.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.440
 And I used to know all of those,

47:34.440 --> 47:36.300
 but now that I just actually do the testing,

47:36.300 --> 47:39.400
 I don't recall them, but it's exactly that line of thinking.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.320
 Like, can you run a mile in this time?

47:41.320 --> 47:44.200
 If you can, your VO2 max is approximately this.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.040
 Great.

47:45.040 --> 47:49.440
 And I think somewhere in my podcast realm,

47:49.440 --> 47:52.740
 I've got all those charts posted of like,

47:52.740 --> 47:56.200
 this is by age, by sex.

47:56.200 --> 47:59.000
 This is what the VO2 max is in each of those buckets.

47:59.000 --> 47:59.840
 Terrific.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.080
 We'll provide links to those.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.880
 We'll have our people find those links.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.680
 And then you mentioned deadlifting body weight 10 times.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.880
 I just made that one up.

48:06.880 --> 48:10.960
 That's not one that we include, but something like that.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.400
 We use farmer carries.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.200
 So we'll say for a male,

48:14.200 --> 48:17.480
 you should be able to farmer carry your body weight for,

48:17.480 --> 48:19.280
 I think we have two minutes.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.920
 So that's half your body weight in each hand.

48:21.920 --> 48:24.880
 You should be able to walk with that for two minutes.

48:24.880 --> 48:27.240
 For women, I think we're doing 75% of body weight

48:27.240 --> 48:28.440
 or something like that, yeah.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.500
 Great, I love it.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.880
 As indirect measures of how healthy we are

48:33.880 --> 48:34.920
 and how long we're going to live.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.420
 It's basically grip strength, it's mobility.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.120
 I mean, again, walking with that much weight

48:39.120 --> 48:42.280
 for some people initially is really hard.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.960
 We use different things like vertical jump,

48:43.960 --> 48:45.980
 ground contact time if you're jumping off a box,

48:45.980 --> 48:46.820
 things like that.

48:46.820 --> 48:48.800
 So it's really trying to capture,

48:48.800 --> 48:50.040
 and it's an evolution, right?

48:50.040 --> 48:53.160
 I think the test is going to get only more and more involved

48:53.160 --> 48:56.440
 as we get involved, because it took us about a year.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.720
 Beth Lewis did the majority of the work to develop this.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.920
 Beth runs our strength and stability program in the practice

49:02.920 --> 49:04.680
 and basically I just tasked her with like,

49:04.680 --> 49:07.120
 hey, go out to the literature and come up with

49:07.120 --> 49:09.480
 all of the best movements that we think are proxies

49:09.480 --> 49:12.800
 for what you need to be like the most kick-ass,

49:12.800 --> 49:14.520
 you know, what we call centenarian decathlete,

49:14.520 --> 49:16.420
 which is the person living in their marginal decade

49:16.420 --> 49:17.600
 at the best.

49:17.600 --> 49:20.420
 Well, what I'm about to say is certainly a mechanistic leap,

49:20.420 --> 49:22.920
 but if you look at the literature on

49:22.920 --> 49:26.240
 exercise-related neurogenesis in mice

49:26.240 --> 49:30.840
 or brain atrophy or brain hypertrophy, et cetera,

49:30.840 --> 49:33.300
 in animal models, it's very clear that the best way

49:33.300 --> 49:36.240
 to get a nervous system to atrophy, to lose neurons,

49:36.240 --> 49:39.820
 shrink neurons, or lose connections between neurons,

49:39.820 --> 49:42.040
 is to stop that animal from moving

49:42.040 --> 49:44.560
 or to de-enrich its environment,

49:44.560 --> 49:47.460
 deprive it of some sensory input or multiple sensory inputs,

49:47.460 --> 49:50.880
 and the best way to enhance the size of neurons,

49:50.880 --> 49:52.120
 the number of connections between neurons,

49:52.120 --> 49:53.360
 and maybe even the number of neurons

49:53.360 --> 49:55.200
 is to enrich its environment and get it moving

49:55.200 --> 49:56.800
 while enriching that environment.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.160
 You know, Andrew, I think it's very difficult for me

49:59.160 --> 50:00.840
 to say that the same is not true in humans.

50:00.840 --> 50:02.560
 And so the first time this became clear to me

50:02.560 --> 50:07.000
 was in 2014, I had an analyst, Dan Pelletier,

50:07.000 --> 50:10.400
 and I said, Dan, I'm gonna give you a project

50:10.400 --> 50:13.240
 that is vexing me to no end, which is

50:13.240 --> 50:17.640
 I want you to look at all of the literature that we have,

50:17.640 --> 50:21.240
 both mechanistic and clinical trial data,

50:21.240 --> 50:24.520
 that talks about Alzheimer's prevention.

50:24.520 --> 50:28.000
 And I wanna know every single type of input,

50:28.000 --> 50:31.440
 and I wanna have a clear sense of via what mechanism

50:31.440 --> 50:33.840
 does it offer, what mode of protection.

50:33.840 --> 50:36.240
 And it took Dan, and this was obviously,

50:36.240 --> 50:38.380
 we iterated a lot on this together,

50:39.640 --> 50:42.940
 and he came back with kind of an amazing presentation

50:42.940 --> 50:46.920
 that took, I don't know, nine months to a year of work.

50:46.920 --> 50:49.560
 And what amazed me was when he came back to it,

50:49.560 --> 50:51.880
 he said, the single greatest efficacy

50:51.880 --> 50:53.920
 we can point to is exercise.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.540
 And I was like, Dan, that's gotta be nonsense, dude.

50:56.540 --> 50:59.300
 There's no way exercise is the single best thing

50:59.300 --> 51:00.320
 you can do for the brain.

51:00.320 --> 51:02.480
 There has to be some drug you've missed.

51:02.480 --> 51:06.380
 There has to be some other thing that you've missed.

51:06.380 --> 51:10.000
 And he's like, no, this is hands down the best thing,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.680
 because it's not just what it's doing to BDNF,

51:12.680 --> 51:15.060
 it's not just what it's doing to vascular endothelium,

51:15.060 --> 51:16.720
 it's not just what it's doing to glucose disposal

51:16.720 --> 51:18.200
 and insulin signaling, all these things.

51:18.200 --> 51:22.240
 It's just touching every aspect of the brain.

51:22.240 --> 51:24.500
 And I was very skeptical for about six months,

51:24.500 --> 51:26.880
 kind of really pushed on him, and I was like,

51:26.880 --> 51:28.120
 I think you're missing something, Dan,

51:28.120 --> 51:29.320
 I think you're missing something.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.480
 And then finally, in the end, looped in Richard Isaacson,

51:31.480 --> 51:33.360
 who's a neurologist that we work with really closely

51:33.360 --> 51:35.880
 on Alzheimer's prevention, and ultimately,

51:35.880 --> 51:38.520
 it turned into a paper that we wrote, basically,

51:38.520 --> 51:41.400
 about this topic, and a few others.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.600
 Because again, I thought, are you sure it's not EPA and DHA?

51:44.600 --> 51:46.000
 That's gotta have a bigger impact.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.040
 And again, there are a lot of things that I think do matter,

51:49.040 --> 51:50.800
 and there's a whole host of things that we do

51:50.800 --> 51:52.480
 for Alzheimer's prevention,

51:52.480 --> 51:53.960
 but I think you're absolutely right.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.960
 There's not one thing that I'll tell patients

51:55.960 --> 51:58.240
 is more important than exercising.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.440
 And by the way, it's not the sort of

52:01.440 --> 52:03.520
 pathetic recommendations that are made.

52:03.520 --> 52:06.200
 Like, you have to exercise a lot more

52:06.200 --> 52:07.700
 if you wanna get this maximum benefit.

52:07.700 --> 52:10.020
 You will get, you know, the maximum benefit

52:10.020 --> 52:12.120
 comes going from nothing to something.

52:12.120 --> 52:14.800
 So if you go from being completely sedentary

52:14.800 --> 52:18.000
 to doing 15 met hours per week,

52:18.000 --> 52:22.440
 you'll get probably a 50% reduction in risk.

52:22.440 --> 52:25.160
 So a met hour, a met, just for people who don't know,

52:25.160 --> 52:26.560
 is a metabolic equivalent.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.920
 So we're exerting about 1.3 mets sitting here talking.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.180
 If we were sitting here being quiet,

52:31.180 --> 52:33.080
 it would be about one met.

52:33.080 --> 52:36.820
 You know, walking really briskly would be about five mets.

52:36.820 --> 52:40.200
 So 15 met hours per week would be

52:40.200 --> 52:42.520
 three one-hour really brisk walks.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.440
 That's not a lot of work.

52:44.440 --> 52:47.600
 But just going from doing nothing to doing that

52:47.600 --> 52:50.320
 would give you 50% of the benefit

52:50.320 --> 52:53.040
 that you would get from going all the way.

52:53.040 --> 52:56.920
 Now, again, I think I'm personally a little skeptical

52:56.920 --> 52:58.800
 of how much that's,

52:58.800 --> 52:59.980
 I think it's probably a bit less than that.

52:59.980 --> 53:02.720
 I think there's more upside than people appreciate.

53:02.720 --> 53:05.160
 But the studies, I don't think, can truly capture that.

53:05.160 --> 53:09.260
 But look, you know, there's no reason

53:09.260 --> 53:11.160
 to not be exercising more than that

53:11.160 --> 53:13.040
 and capture more benefit,

53:13.040 --> 53:15.600
 even though the rate at which you accrue it is less.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.760
 And it also speaks to the healthspan side of this,

53:17.760 --> 53:19.840
 which is not necessarily captured in those data.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.600
 The healthspan gets back to the functional piece

53:21.600 --> 53:23.880
 we opened with, which is what do you want to be doing

53:23.880 --> 53:24.920
 in your marginal decade?

53:24.920 --> 53:26.840
 Do you want to be able to pick up a great grandkid

53:26.840 --> 53:28.160
 if they come running at you?

53:28.160 --> 53:29.880
 Do you want to be able to get up off the floor?

53:29.880 --> 53:31.520
 Do you want to be able to play on the floor with a kid

53:31.520 --> 53:33.800
 and then get up on your own?

53:33.800 --> 53:36.800
 And I think most people are thinking final years of life,

53:36.800 --> 53:37.620
 they're trying to think, you know,

53:37.620 --> 53:40.080
 how can they take themselves to the bathroom?

53:40.080 --> 53:43.040
 They're thinking, how can they sit up off the toilet?

53:43.040 --> 53:44.880
 I mean, you've got really basic,

53:44.880 --> 53:48.760
 vegetative-type functions, right, at some level.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.280
 I love this, again, this idea of marginal decade

53:51.280 --> 53:53.680
 and using that as a way to backcast

53:53.680 --> 53:58.680
 to actual methods and behaviors and protocols

53:59.160 --> 54:01.200
 that one should be doing on a daily basis.

54:02.120 --> 54:05.160
 I'll use ANIC data, as it's now called,

54:05.160 --> 54:08.280
 to cite just, I know, three Nobel Prize winners,

54:08.280 --> 54:09.520
 which doesn't mean anything

54:09.520 --> 54:10.800
 except that they did beautiful work,

54:10.800 --> 54:12.880
 but the point is that they're all in their 90s.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.120
 So I'll name them

54:14.120 --> 54:16.880
 because I'm complimenting them for what they've done,

54:16.880 --> 54:18.620
 not just their work, but what I'm about to describe.

54:18.620 --> 54:21.360
 So Eric Kandel at Columbia,

54:21.360 --> 54:23.380
 Nobel Prize-winning for work on memory,

54:23.380 --> 54:25.380
 Torrance and Wiesel, work on neuroplasticity,

54:25.380 --> 54:28.620
 and then Richard Axel, who's also at Columbia,

54:28.620 --> 54:30.800
 Nobel Prize-winning work for molecular biology of smell

54:30.800 --> 54:33.440
 and molecular biology generally.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.780
 All three of them still alive.

54:35.780 --> 54:38.160
 Richard's younger compared to the other two.

54:38.160 --> 54:41.480
 All three of them either swim, jog, or play tennis,

54:41.480 --> 54:43.780
 or racquetball, I think is Richard's thing,

54:43.780 --> 54:45.160
 multiple times per week.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.880
 Eric was, they're all cognitively still extremely sharp,

54:48.880 --> 54:50.860
 still interested in the arts, doing science,

54:50.860 --> 54:52.740
 curious about science, running laboratories,

54:52.740 --> 54:54.240
 writing books, going on podcasts.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.420
 I mean, it's incredible.

54:55.420 --> 54:57.000
 Again, that's ANIC data,

54:57.000 --> 55:00.180
 but I was kind of surprised to learn that colleagues

55:00.180 --> 55:01.940
 that were so intellectually strong

55:01.940 --> 55:04.000
 were also so obsessed with exercise.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.500
 I mean, they really are obsessed with their exercise routine

55:06.500 --> 55:08.040
 and early on linked that

55:08.040 --> 55:12.780
 to some of their intellectual vigor over time.

55:12.780 --> 55:14.720
 I want to just also use it as a jumping off point

55:14.720 --> 55:17.960
 to ask about one kind of niche thing, but it comes up.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.360
 I don't think I'm going to out which one of those

55:19.360 --> 55:21.960
 told me this, but one of those three individuals

55:21.960 --> 55:24.840
 choose an excessive amount of Nicorette.

55:24.840 --> 55:27.360
 Used to be a smoker and I asked him why.

55:27.360 --> 55:31.040
 And he said, because in his estimation,

55:31.040 --> 55:33.520
 it's protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,

55:33.520 --> 55:38.520
 or at least the nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation

55:39.020 --> 55:41.280
 of nicotine, because nicotine is an acetylcholine receptor,

55:41.280 --> 55:45.440
 obviously, is known to create a state of focus

55:45.440 --> 55:47.060
 and neural enhancement.

55:47.060 --> 55:49.720
 What are your thoughts about not smoking?

55:49.720 --> 55:51.080
 Let's just, I want to be really clear.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.840
 People don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine.

55:53.840 --> 55:54.680
 It's going to shorten your life.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.840
 Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, in my opinion.

55:57.840 --> 56:02.520
 But what are your thoughts about augmenting acetylcholine

56:02.520 --> 56:03.760
 through the use of nicotine

56:03.760 --> 56:06.080
 in order to keep the brain healthy and focused?

56:06.080 --> 56:07.780
 Again, this is one Nobel Prize winner,

56:07.780 --> 56:09.560
 so it's truly N of one,

56:09.560 --> 56:11.760
 but he's so convinced that this matches up

56:11.760 --> 56:14.400
 with the mechanistic data on acetylcholine and cognition

56:14.400 --> 56:16.240
 that I'd love to get your thoughts on it.

56:16.240 --> 56:19.320
 So I can't speak to the AD prevention component of it.

56:19.320 --> 56:21.960
 I'd have to run that by a couple of my colleagues

56:21.960 --> 56:24.240
 who I collaborate with on that,

56:24.240 --> 56:25.520
 but I can definitely speak

56:25.520 --> 56:27.900
 to the cognitive enhancement piece of it.

56:27.900 --> 56:31.800
 And I actually did an AMA on this probably a year ago

56:31.800 --> 56:34.400
 where I went into all of the gory details of it

56:34.400 --> 56:37.100
 and talked about my own use of nicotine,

56:37.100 --> 56:38.680
 which I'll cycle on and off.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.400
 I've been doing it for the last 10 years.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.980
 What form do you take it in?

56:41.980 --> 56:43.320
 I used to use the gum.

56:43.320 --> 56:44.360
 I don't like the gum anymore,

56:44.360 --> 56:46.300
 so now I like these little lozenges.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.200
 I'll tell you a funny story about this.

56:51.200 --> 56:55.460
 So our mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair,

56:55.460 --> 56:59.720
 mentioned a company to me a year ago.

56:59.720 --> 57:02.120
 He's like, hey, have you heard of this company?

57:02.120 --> 57:03.440
 And I forget the name of the company,

57:03.440 --> 57:04.920
 but he gave me some name.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.000
 So I go online,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.800
 and it's like this company selling nicotine.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.480
 And I'm like, I wonder why he's asking me to do this.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.300
 Well, I'll just order a bunch,

57:12.300 --> 57:13.840
 and then we'll figure out why,

57:13.840 --> 57:15.840
 because there was some reason

57:15.840 --> 57:19.200
 we were doing this potentially through investment.

57:19.200 --> 57:22.920
 So I literally ordered a lifetime supply of this stuff,

57:22.920 --> 57:23.760
 and it's pretty good.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.120
 It's a really nice little patch,

57:25.120 --> 57:26.600
 because the thing I didn't like about the gum

57:26.600 --> 57:29.080
 was I hated just the taste of it.

57:31.120 --> 57:32.800
 So then the next week I'm talking to David,

57:32.800 --> 57:33.640
 and I'm like, by the way,

57:33.640 --> 57:35.400
 I ordered all that nicotine stuff you told me about.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.880
 He's like, what?

57:36.880 --> 57:39.920
 And he goes, oh, oh, the company's name was something else.

57:39.920 --> 57:41.680
 It was totally unrelated.

57:41.680 --> 57:43.380
 I was like, oh, God.

57:43.380 --> 57:47.480
 So the short answer is I think this stuff

57:47.480 --> 57:52.140
 is absolutely a concentration-enhancing substance.

57:53.040 --> 57:55.040
 It is addictive, and people need to be wary of that.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.440
 Now, it's not addictive to everybody.

57:56.440 --> 58:00.600
 I personally experience no addiction to it whatsoever.

58:00.600 --> 58:04.280
 So I could do it every day for 30 days

58:04.280 --> 58:06.400
 and stop and experience no withdrawal.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.400
 I could forget about it.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.040
 It doesn't really seem to matter.

58:10.560 --> 58:12.440
 You have to be careful with the dose, truthfully.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.240
 I mean, remember, one cigarette

58:14.240 --> 58:16.640
 is about one milligram of nicotine,

58:16.640 --> 58:20.240
 and a lot of these lozenges will plow

58:20.240 --> 58:23.420
 four to eight milligrams into you in one shot.

58:23.420 --> 58:28.420
 And for someone who is naive to that like I am,

58:28.520 --> 58:31.400
 four milligrams is a lot of nicotine in one bolus.

58:31.400 --> 58:34.440
 So you just have to be very mindful of it.

58:34.440 --> 58:38.600
 I got a lot of flack when I did this AMA

58:38.600 --> 58:40.640
 for obvious reasons, but people were like,

58:40.640 --> 58:43.880
 how can you, as a doctor, encourage people to use nicotine?

58:43.880 --> 58:44.920
 And I was like, first of all,

58:44.920 --> 58:46.160
 I'm not encouraging anybody to use it.

58:46.160 --> 58:49.720
 I just wanna be able to talk about the biochemistry of it.

58:49.720 --> 58:52.040
 And if disclosing that I use it from time to time

58:52.040 --> 58:54.820
 is an endorsement, then I apologize for that.

58:55.920 --> 58:58.280
 But on the list of things that you can do

58:58.280 --> 59:01.120
 to make your brain a little more focused,

59:01.120 --> 59:03.300
 I would consider this infinitely safer

59:03.300 --> 59:04.540
 than what a lot of people are doing,

59:04.540 --> 59:06.340
 which is using stimulants.

59:06.340 --> 59:10.440
 I mean, to me, I just tell patients outright,

59:10.440 --> 59:13.520
 we are under no circumstance prescribing stimulants.

59:13.520 --> 59:16.400
 I mean, we're not giving anybody Adderall.

59:16.400 --> 59:20.020
 We're not giving anybody Vyvanse or any of these things.

59:20.020 --> 59:22.040
 Not to say they don't have an appropriate clinical use,

59:22.040 --> 59:24.360
 but they should be prescribed under the care

59:24.360 --> 59:27.360
 of somebody who's really monitoring the use case for it.

59:27.360 --> 59:31.520
 And using that as a tool to enhance concentration

59:31.520 --> 59:32.360
 and cognitive performance

59:32.360 --> 59:33.760
 is not something we're comfortable doing.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.480
 Yeah, it's rampant on college campuses.

59:36.480 --> 59:37.800
 I can only imagine.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.000
 Our modafinil, modafinil,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
 which are slightly different, of course,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.640
 so non-clinical use, not prescribed for ADHD,

59:44.640 --> 59:48.400
 but just it's rampant, recreational use, study-based use.

59:48.400 --> 59:51.120
 But the data I've seen on modafinil suggests

59:51.120 --> 59:53.560
 that it only really provides a nootropic benefit

59:53.560 --> 59:55.480
 in someone who is deprived of sleep.

59:55.480 --> 59:59.360
 Is there data that in a totally well-rested person,

59:59.360 --> 1:00:01.400
 there is a nootropic benefit of modafinil?

1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:02.240
 I don't know.

1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:04.000
 I have one experience with R-modafinil

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.200
 where I took a half a recommended dose.

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:08.400
 This was prescribed by a doctor.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:09.600
 I went to give a talk.

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:10.820
 This is in Hawaii.

1:00:10.820 --> 1:00:13.140
 And four hours into the talk,

1:00:13.140 --> 1:00:16.040
 my co-speaker came up to me and just said,

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:17.880
 well, first of all, you got a little bit of a spit

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:18.760
 in the corner of your mouth.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:20.840
 And second of all, you haven't blinked in three minutes.

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:23.880
 And third, there's only two people left in the audience.

1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:27.800
 I was so lasered in that I kind of forgot the context.

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.360
 I'm a little bit of a kind of a tunnel vision OCD type

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:33.580
 anyway, but that was all it took.

1:00:33.580 --> 1:00:35.120
 I never took any more of it.

1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:37.200
 It was a powerful stimulant.

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:41.360
 I take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC now and again

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:43.840
 before some cognitive work, sometimes before workouts.

1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:47.260
 And I do subjectively feel that it narrows my focus

1:00:47.260 --> 1:00:50.480
 in a nice way, but I don't take it more

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:53.160
 than once or twice a day and more than once or twice a week.

1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:54.920
 So this is an example of where,

1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:56.360
 you know how we're talking about exercise

1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:00.040
 versus sort of nutrition and supplements for longevity.

1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:01.600
 I think there may be a whole bunch of things

1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:03.640
 that are kind of interesting around focus,

1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:06.200
 but nothing would compare to changing our environment.

1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:09.560
 Like I think that if I compare my focus today

1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:12.680
 to my focus when I was in college, there's no comparison.

1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:16.120
 Like in college, I was truly a robot,

1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:19.400
 but I think a large part of it was there was no distraction.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:21.880
 There was no email, there was no social media,

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:22.880
 there was no internet.

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:25.800
 I mean, I was in college when Mosaic launched

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:29.880
 in the early 90s, and you had to walk like a mile

1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:32.600
 to get to the computer lab on a big sun workstation

1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:36.360
 to do anything in some computer code language.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.920
 So when you're sitting in your room studying,

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:41.300
 there was no distraction.

1:01:41.300 --> 1:01:43.720
 And I think that's a far greater component

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.480
 of what it means to be focused

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:46.600
 than the challenges we have today.

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.600
 So my thoughts on this would be if we really wanted

1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:52.160
 to return to a state of focus,

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:54.560
 we're gonna have to individually do something

1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:56.200
 about our environment.

1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.080
 And I don't know what the answer is.

1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:00.960
 Like I've tried every little trick I can think of,

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.600
 like closing my browsers when I'm writing and stuff,

1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:05.720
 but I'm just not strong enough willed.

1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:08.040
 Like I'll pick up my phone every 20 minutes

1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:09.800
 to look and see if I miss the text message

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:10.880
 or something stupid.

1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:12.080
 That's pretty infrequent.

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.600
 I did a episode on habits and looking at the data.

1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:19.040
 It seems that people are getting interrupted

1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:22.560
 or interrupting themselves about once every three minutes

1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:23.880
 in the typical workplace.

1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:25.200
 Now that typical has changed

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:27.060
 with a lot more people working at home.

1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:29.040
 I do put my phone away when I try and work,

1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:31.640
 that nothing focuses me like a deadline,

1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:33.880
 a little bit of a fear-based urgency.

1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:34.720
 That's it.

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:36.840
 Grant deadlines, drop deadlines as I call them,

1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:38.720
 or podcasts we're gonna record today

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:40.640
 that nothing works quite like it,

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.940
 but such as life.

1:02:42.940 --> 1:02:47.000
 Well, thanks for that offshoot about nicotine.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.440
 Again, you're not recommending it.

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:50.400
 I'm not recommending it,

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:54.320
 but it's clear that augmenting the acetylcholine system,

1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:57.100
 which is what nicotine does in its various forms

1:02:57.100 --> 1:03:00.800
 and some related type pharmacology does enhance focus

1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:01.800
 and pretty potently.

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:03.260
 So I think it's gonna be an interesting area

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:06.300
 for real clinical trials and things of that sort.

1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:11.920
 Love to chat about hormone therapies and hormones generally.

1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:14.000
 When Robert Sapolsky came on the podcast,

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000
 we talked a little bit about menopause

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.040
 and the data around menopause.

1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:20.600
 He's very interested in these findings that,

1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:22.140
 I think I'm gonna get this right,

1:03:22.140 --> 1:03:26.920
 that whether or not women benefit from estrogen therapy

1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:28.620
 to offset menopause really depends

1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:30.900
 on when that therapy is initiated.

1:03:30.900 --> 1:03:32.240
 I don't know if you're aware of those data,

1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:36.680
 but he claimed that if they begin estrogen therapy

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:40.040
 in the middle to tail end of menopause,

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:43.040
 the outcomes can be quite bad.

1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:45.760
 Whereas if they initiate those estrogen therapies

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:48.640
 as they enter menopause or even before menopause,

1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:50.640
 then the outcomes can be quite good.

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.620
 I don't know what percentage of the patients you treat

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:53.820
 are male versus female

1:03:53.820 --> 1:03:55.900
 and what ages those patients are, of course,

1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:58.600
 but what are your thoughts about estrogen therapy

1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:01.640
 for women, menopause, and hormone therapies

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:03.560
 generally for women, maybe even testosterone therapy.

1:04:03.560 --> 1:04:04.600
 You hear about that these days.

1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:05.880
 And then we'll talk about men.

1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:10.800
 So our practice is probably 70, 30 male, female.

1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:15.200
 So we have lots of women and this is a very important topic.

1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:19.320
 It's also probably, let me think.

1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:20.920
 I just want to make sure I'm not being hyperbolic

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:21.820
 when I say this.

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:24.060
 Yeah, I don't think I am.

1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:26.280
 It's hands down the biggest screw up

1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:29.400
 of the entire medical field in the last 25 years.

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.200
 Now again, it's possible in the next hour,

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:34.840
 I'll think of, there's a bigger screw up.

1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:35.680
 Another giant screw up.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:37.360
 Yeah, but I don't think I will.

1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:41.240
 I'm pretty confident that I won't be able to think

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:46.240
 of a bigger act of incompetence than what happened

1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:51.960
 with the Women's Health Initiative in the late 90s

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:55.800
 and early 2000s, which is effectively the study

1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:58.240
 that turned the entire medical field

1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:00.880
 off hormone replacement therapy for women.

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:02.980
 So it's important, I think, to explain

1:05:02.980 --> 1:05:04.360
 what the study looked at.

1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:08.080
 So this was a study that was conducted in response

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:13.080
 to the widely held belief in the 70s and 80s

1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000
 that women should be placed on hormones

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.560
 as they're going through menopause, right?

1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:22.480
 Menopause is, I guess maybe I'll even take a step back.

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:23.840
 I don't know how much your audience is familiar

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:25.360
 with how estrogen and progesterone work.

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:26.840
 Is it worth going into that stuff?

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:29.080
 Yeah, probably worth mentioning a bit of the top contour.

1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:30.400
 Some of them might be familiar with it.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.120
 We've done episodes on estrogen and testosterone,

1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:34.080
 but frankly, as I think back to those,

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:35.340
 we didn't really go into the biology

1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:38.120
 of estrogen, testosterone, you know.

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:40.360
 Yeah, so, I mean, actually an interesting aside

1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:41.800
 that I always tell my female patients

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:43.160
 who get a kick out of this,

1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:45.800
 when you look at a woman's labs,

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:50.080
 you'll see her estrogen, her progesterone, her FSH, her LH,

1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:51.860
 her testosterone, her sex hormone binding globulin,

1:05:51.860 --> 1:05:55.320
 all these things, but based on the units they're reported in

1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:57.440
 it's a very distorting picture

1:05:57.440 --> 1:06:00.920
 of what the most common androgen is in her body.

1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:02.960
 If you actually convert them to the same units,

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:05.800
 she has much more testosterone in her body than estrogen.

1:06:07.300 --> 1:06:08.840
 Interesting. Yeah.

1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:10.000
 I did not know that. Yeah.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.480
 Then again, I've never been a woman

1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:13.080
 getting my hormone profile done.

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:14.920
 Yeah, so even though a woman's testosterone

1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:18.720
 is much less than a man's level,

1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:21.840
 it's still more than she has estrogen in her body.

1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:24.640
 So phenotypically, right, estrogen is the hormone

1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:26.680
 that's dominating and so it's the, you know,

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:28.360
 she has much higher estrogen than a man

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:30.320
 and much lower testosterone than a man,

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:31.840
 but in absolute amounts,

1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:33.440
 she has more testosterone than estrogen.

1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:34.520
 Just worth pointing that out.

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:35.360
 Incredible.

1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:38.560
 So, you know, what's happening to a woman

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:40.120
 from the age she starts menstruating

1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:41.840
 until she goes through menopause,

1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:44.260
 outside of pregnancy and birth control and stuff like that,

1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:45.760
 is she has this cycle, you know,

1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:47.980
 roughly every 28 days, but it can vary,

1:06:47.980 --> 1:06:50.140
 where at the beginning of her period,

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.600
 we call that day zero,

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:55.040
 her estrogen and progesterone are very low.

1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:56.440
 You can't measure them.

1:06:56.440 --> 1:07:00.960
 And then what happens is the estrogen level starts to rise

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:04.240
 and it rises in response to a hormone

1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:07.820
 called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH,

1:07:07.820 --> 1:07:09.560
 that is getting her ready to ovulate

1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:11.660
 and she ovulates at about the midpoint of her cycle.

1:07:11.660 --> 1:07:13.440
 So if we're just gonna make the math easy,

1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:16.040
 on day 14, she's going to release a follicle

1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:17.840
 from one of her ovaries.

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:20.920
 And the estrogen level is sort of rising, rising, rising.

1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:24.140
 We love to measure hormones on day five

1:07:24.140 --> 1:07:26.260
 because I wanna have a standardized way

1:07:26.260 --> 1:07:27.880
 in which I measure her hormones.

1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:30.800
 So our women know if we're in the business

1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:32.080
 of trying to understand her hormones,

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:33.340
 the day her period starts,

1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:34.680
 even if it's just a day of spotting,

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:35.900
 that becomes our benchmark.

1:07:35.900 --> 1:07:39.240
 And then day five, I wanna see every hormone on that day.

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.020
 And if everything is going well,

1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:43.200
 I know what her FSH, LH, estradiol,

1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:45.380
 and progesterone should be on that day.

1:07:45.380 --> 1:07:47.000
 So the estrogen rises,

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.660
 starts to come down a little bit as she ovulates,

1:07:49.660 --> 1:07:51.560
 and then the luteinizing hormone kicks on

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:54.760
 because it's now going to prepare her uterus

1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:59.160
 for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy.

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:01.440
 So now you start to see estradiol go back,

1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:03.300
 but now for the first time, progesterone goes up.

1:08:03.300 --> 1:08:06.440
 So progesterone has been doing nothing for 14 days,

1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:07.700
 and now it starts to rise.

1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:09.320
 And actually, progesterone is the hormone

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:11.040
 that's dominating the second half,

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:13.280
 which is called her luteal cycle.

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:15.600
 So the first 14 days is the follicular cycle,

1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:17.520
 second is the luteal cycle.

1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:20.040
 So once you get to about the halfway point of that,

1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:23.040
 which is now, just to do the math, 21 days in,

1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:25.360
 the body has figured out if she's pregnant or not.

1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:27.760
 And again, most of the time she's not gonna be pregnant,

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.960
 so the body says, oh, I don't need this lining

1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:32.240
 that I've been preparing, I'm going to shed it.

1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:35.840
 So now progesterone and estrogen start crashing,

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:37.560
 and the lining is what is being shed,

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:38.760
 and that is the menses.

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:42.620
 By the way, it's that last seven days of that cycle

1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:44.260
 that in a susceptible woman

1:08:44.260 --> 1:08:47.280
 is what creates those PMS symptoms.

1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:48.720
 So it's the, actually, this is something

1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:49.600
 that you would probably have

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:51.340
 a better understanding of than me.

1:08:51.340 --> 1:08:54.760
 There is something about this in a susceptible woman

1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:59.080
 where the enormous reduction of progesterone so quickly

1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:01.880
 is probably impacting something in her brain.

1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:04.020
 So I think this is a legitimate thing, right?

1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:05.960
 I mean, it's not like, oh, she's crazy

1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:09.320
 because she's having all these PMS symptoms, no.

1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:10.440
 We know that that's the case

1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:12.240
 because if you put women on progesterone

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:14.680
 for those seven days, those symptoms go away.

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.640
 So if you can stabilize their progesterone

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.640
 during the last half of their luteal phase,

1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:20.680
 and sometimes we would just do it

1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:21.840
 for the entire luteal phase,

1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:24.100
 just put them on a low dose of progesterone,

1:09:24.100 --> 1:09:25.460
 all PMS symptoms vanish.

1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:26.300
 Very interesting.

1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:28.700
 I'll have to look up where the progesterone receptors

1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:29.540
 are located in the brain.

1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:33.240
 The Allen Brain Institute now has beautiful data

1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:34.500
 of in situ hyperization,

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:35.880
 which for folks that don't understand

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:38.600
 is looking at RNA and sort of where genes

1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:41.320
 and proteins ought to be expressed in the human brain

1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:43.380
 by using actual human brain tissue sections

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:44.320
 as opposed to just mice.

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:45.160
 So I'll take a look.

1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:48.160
 I think some insight into what that

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.300
 progesterone emotionality link might be

1:09:50.300 --> 1:09:52.920
 and where it might exist neural circuit-wise.

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:55.480
 So then when the estrogen and progesterone

1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:58.500
 reach their nadir again, that starts the cycle.

1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:02.100
 So that cycle is happening over and over and over again.

1:10:02.100 --> 1:10:06.640
 Okay, so it became well known in the 50s

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:09.480
 that okay, a woman's gonna stop menstruating at some point.

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:10.540
 Her estrogen goes down.

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:12.560
 Why don't we just give her estrogen?

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:13.920
 Because that's clearly gonna help

1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:15.480
 with some of the symptoms of menopause.

1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:18.080
 So what do women experience when they go through menopause?

1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:20.480
 The first symptoms are what are called vasomotor symptoms.

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:24.000
 So this is usually in the form of night sweats,

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.980
 hot flashes, and depending on the woman,

1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:28.680
 this can be really significant, right?

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:31.740
 These are women who can have a hard time sleeping.

1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:33.540
 They can be having hot flashes during the middle of the day.

1:10:33.540 --> 1:10:35.980
 They can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat.

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:40.760
 Those tend to pass after a couple of years,

1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:43.120
 and then they get into sort of the more

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.280
 long-term complications of menopause.

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:48.680
 So what we call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness,

1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:50.800
 and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago,

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:54.160
 which is the osteopenia, osteoporosis.

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:56.720
 A lot of women will complain of brain fog.

1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.800
 So I mean, clearly this was an issue,

1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:04.720
 and it was recognized 70 years ago.

1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:06.800
 Why don't we give women estrogen back

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.840
 to replace that hormone?

1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:12.200
 And so that went on for a couple of decades,

1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:14.380
 maybe less, maybe a decade, and then it was realized,

1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:19.020
 wait a minute, we were driving up the risk of uterine cancer.

1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:23.440
 And the reason for that is if you just give estrogen

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:26.700
 with no progesterone to antagonize it,

1:11:26.700 --> 1:11:29.960
 you will thicken the endometrium endlessly,

1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:33.220
 and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia.

1:11:33.220 --> 1:11:35.160
 Well, you'll definitely undergo hyperplasia,

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:36.560
 and then ultimately dysplasia.

1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:38.000
 Dysplasia is precancerous,

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.740
 and ultimately we were seeing that.

1:11:39.740 --> 1:11:42.120
 So people figured out, well, actually,

1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.440
 if you want to give estrogen to a woman

1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:45.480
 who still has her uterus,

1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:47.560
 you have to give her progesterone as well.

1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:49.360
 You have to be able to have a hormone

1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:50.920
 to oppose the estrogen.

1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:55.820
 And then that became effectively, call it the 1970s-ish,

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:59.640
 the standard for HRT.

1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:04.560
 So in the early 1990s, the NIH said,

1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:06.840
 look, we haven't really studied this.

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.440
 We have a ton of epidemiology that says

1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:14.160
 giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things.

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:17.760
 They feel better, so all their symptoms go away.

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:20.200
 They seem to have lower risk of heart disease,

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:24.800
 lower risk of cardiovascular disease,

1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:27.520
 lower risk of bone fractures.

1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:30.420
 Everything seems to get better, lower risk of diabetes.

1:12:30.420 --> 1:12:31.620
 But we haven't tested this

1:12:31.620 --> 1:12:34.600
 in a randomized prospective trial, so let's do this.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:36.560
 So that became the WHI.

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:39.240
 And it randomized, it had two parallel arms.

1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:44.240
 So it had a group for women who did not have a uterus.

1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:46.160
 So these are women that had undergone hysterectomy

1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:47.060
 for some other reason.

1:12:47.060 --> 1:12:48.500
 And then it had a group for women

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:50.080
 that did have their uterus.

1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:53.240
 In the first group, there was a placebo arm

1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:55.200
 and then an estrogen-only arm.

1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:57.240
 And in the other group, there was a progesterone

1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.620
 plus estrogen versus a placebo.

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.480
 Everything about the way this study was done

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:05.380
 is a bit wonky.

1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:06.880
 Some of it is justifiable,

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.840
 but it's important to understand.

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:13.400
 First, the women were all way outside of menopause.

1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:16.460
 So none of these women were started

1:13:16.460 --> 1:13:18.420
 when you would normally start HRT.

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:23.040
 And there were probably several reasons for that,

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.860
 but one of them is, and I think this is a legitimate reason,

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:28.920
 they wanted hard outcomes.

1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:31.160
 They wanted to know death rates.

1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:33.880
 And if you're doing this on women in their 50s,

1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:35.520
 you just weren't gonna get it, right?

1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:36.360
 You couldn't-

1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:37.180
 You gotta wait too long.

1:13:37.180 --> 1:13:38.020
 Yeah, you gotta wait too long.

1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:40.280
 There was only gonna be like a seven to 10-year study.

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:43.160
 So they had to do this on women who were much older.

1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:47.040
 They also disproportionately took much sicker women.

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:48.720
 I believe the prevalence,

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:50.240
 and again, I'm gonna get some of these numbers wrong

1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:51.760
 and people are gonna get all phosphorylated,

1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:54.400
 but I mean, I'm in the ballpark, right?

1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:57.220
 Something like 30, 40% of these women were smokers.

1:13:57.220 --> 1:14:00.480
 The prevalence of obesity, diabetes was enormous.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.720
 So they really disproportionately picked

1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:04.580
 the most unhealthy population they could

1:14:04.580 --> 1:14:06.360
 that was pretty advanced in age.

1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:08.200
 And again, I think part of that was to say,

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:10.440
 look, we wanna make sure that after seven years,

1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:12.160
 we really know if there's a difference

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:13.540
 in these causes of death.

1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:18.880
 The other thing is, this is kind of weird,

1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:21.320
 although again, I understand their rationale for it,

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:25.060
 but this is a great example of be very careful

1:14:25.060 --> 1:14:27.300
 when you look at a clinical trial

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:29.380
 that it remotely represents the patients

1:14:29.380 --> 1:14:30.900
 you're interested in treating.

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:33.780
 So they also treated no patients who were symptomatic.

1:14:33.780 --> 1:14:38.220
 The rationale being, if we include in the study

1:14:38.220 --> 1:14:39.740
 patients who are symptomatic,

1:14:39.740 --> 1:14:43.060
 those who are randomized to placebo will drop out.

1:14:45.180 --> 1:14:47.420
 Okay, it makes sense in terms of study design,

1:14:47.420 --> 1:14:49.260
 makes no sense if the study design

1:14:49.260 --> 1:14:52.140
 is intended to mimic the real world.

1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:52.980
 That's right.

1:14:52.980 --> 1:14:54.500
 So now let's just keep track of the three issues.

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:58.180
 We have a disproportionately unhealthy patient population

1:14:58.180 --> 1:14:59.940
 who are not symptomatic,

1:14:59.940 --> 1:15:03.880
 and we're starting them more than 10 years after menopause.

1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:06.960
 The next thing that they did,

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:09.440
 which again, I understand why they did it,

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:13.640
 but it's now the fourth strike against this study is,

1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:16.100
 and I've spoken with the PI of the study

1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:17.720
 and asked this question point blank.

1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:19.540
 I'm actually gonna have her on my podcast

1:15:19.540 --> 1:15:22.640
 at some point soon to go over this in more detail,

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:26.960
 is why did you use conjugated equine estrogen and MPA,

1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:29.320
 which is a synthetic form of progesterone?

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:30.340
 A horse?

1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:31.180
 Yes.

1:15:31.180 --> 1:15:32.020
 Estrogen?

1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:34.300
 It's horse urine, they collect horse urine.

1:15:34.300 --> 1:15:35.640
 So they're getting the-

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.960
 Horses do urinate a lot, or at least when they urinate,

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:40.520
 it seems like a large volume of urine

1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:42.080
 from what I've observed.

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:43.320
 You have a lot of experience with this?

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:46.400
 No, but you know, my sister rode horses for a little while.

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:49.360
 My high school girlfriend had a horse and that thing,

1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:52.480
 I mean, the peas were legendary.

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:54.840
 It's a male horse.

1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:56.080
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:58.720
 So yeah, so the conjugated equine estrogen

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:02.280
 is the estrogen that's collected from female horses,

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:05.080
 and then it's a synthetic progesterone.

1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:07.920
 And I said to the person, I said,

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:10.160
 well, why didn't you use what we use today,

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:12.520
 which is bioidentical estrogen and progesterone?

1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:15.080
 Like today, when we put women on estrogen,

1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:18.040
 we use a, it's an FDA product called the Vivel Dot.

1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:21.120
 So it's a patch that you just put on and it's estradiol,

1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:22.480
 but it's bioidentical estradiol,

1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:24.360
 and we use what's called micronized progesterone,

1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:26.600
 so bioidentical progesterone.

1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:29.480
 And she said, well, at the time,

1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:31.640
 we just wanted to test what was currently being used.

1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:33.000
 I said, totally makes sense.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.720
 But again, now you have four considerations

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.680
 that you have to keep in mind.

1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:40.320
 Okay, so despite those four considerations,

1:16:40.320 --> 1:16:41.520
 and I'm gonna make a case for you

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:45.920
 why I think the MPA created a real problem in that study,

1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:47.960
 the synthetic progesterone.

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:52.960
 When the preliminary results were first made available,

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:55.600
 but not yet peer reviewed and not yet published,

1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:59.600
 there was a huge fiasco, huge press announcement about it,

1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:04.600
 suggesting that the women receiving the CEE plus MPA

1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:09.440
 in the group with the uterus

1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:12.120
 had a higher incidence of breast cancer.

1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:15.440
 And that basically became the headline that never went away,

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:17.240
 though it turned out not to be true.

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:19.480
 Let's talk about the numbers.

1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:23.080
 What was the increase in the risk of breast cancer

1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:23.920
 in that group?

1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:25.960
 Which gets to my, if you've ever listened to me

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.840
 on the podcast, rail on something.

1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:31.280
 Listen, I have about 3,800 pet peeves and counting.

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:34.680
 My laboratory staff know these, know a good number of them.

1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:38.000
 So you do not have to apologize for having many pet peeves,

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.120
 because as long as they have experience

1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:42.240
 and data to support them, it provides a better life.

1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:44.800
 So one of my biggest pet peeves is,

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:46.200
 and my team knows this,

1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:48.080
 because sometimes they'll occasionally,

1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:50.600
 they'll do this and I'll have to remind them.

1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:52.860
 You never talk about a relative risk change

1:17:52.860 --> 1:17:55.120
 without an absolute risk accommodating it, right?

1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:56.760
 So what does that look like?

1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:00.320
 So the relative risk increase of breast cancer

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:04.360
 in the estrogen plus MPA group versus the placebo

1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:09.360
 was 25, 27%, and that became the only headline.

1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:15.400
 HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 27%.

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:19.840
 Now, I don't think that's true at all today,

1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:21.280
 but let's even look at the data.

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.960
 What was the ARR?

1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:25.760
 What was the absolute risk increase?

1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:29.480
 It was a difference between five cases per thousand

1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:31.120
 and four cases per thousand.

1:18:31.980 --> 1:18:36.980
 So the ARR was 0.1%, one case in a thousand.

1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:41.560
 And it's true, going from four in a thousand

1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:45.640
 to five in a thousand is a 25% increase,

1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:48.320
 but it's a completely inappropriate context.

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:51.920
 I agree, and I feel like headlines of that sort,

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:52.920
 which have come up recently

1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:54.680
 around various dietary interventions,

1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:57.900
 we won't go there, at least not for the time being,

1:18:57.900 --> 1:18:59.400
 are nothing short of criminal

1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:03.000
 because they really distort people's thinking,

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.200
 but also they steer the course of science and medicine

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:09.760
 for, as you pointed out, for decades, if not longer.

1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:12.120
 And they can really take us off our health track

1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:13.700
 in serious ways.

1:19:13.700 --> 1:19:15.760
 So I'll bring this meandering to a close,

1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:18.440
 which is to say, even though I could spend the next hour

1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:21.800
 talking about all of the ways in which this study was flawed

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:24.000
 and all of the very unethical things

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.120
 that were done by a number of the investigators

1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:30.280
 who went out of their way to mask the truth of this study

1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:33.380
 from the world, I'll tell a woman today,

1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:35.960
 we're gonna start you on this

1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:37.400
 when you're going through menopause,

1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:41.520
 we're using bioidentical hormones,

1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:45.920
 and if your upper bound risk of breast cancer

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:49.920
 is one case in 1,000, you should at least weigh that

1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:51.960
 against all of the other benefits, which I'll talk about.

1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:53.400
 Now there's something else I wanna say,

1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:54.720
 because a moment ago I alluded to the fact

1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:57.120
 that I think the MPA might have been the biggest issue

1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:57.960
 in that study.

1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:01.420
 So there were two findings in that study that were negative.

1:20:01.420 --> 1:20:04.920
 One was the small increase in the risk of heart disease

1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:07.760
 and the small increase in the risk of breast cancer.

1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:09.860
 But consider the other group.

1:20:09.860 --> 1:20:12.600
 We forgot about the group that didn't have a uterus,

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:16.240
 because remember, those women got estrogen only

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:18.000
 versus placebo.

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.800
 What was the difference in breast cancer there?

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:21.620
 Well, this is interesting

1:20:21.620 --> 1:20:24.120
 because it didn't reach statistical significance,

1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:27.040
 but its P value was 0.06 or 0.07.

1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:30.260
 So it came very close, but it was in the opposite direction.

1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:35.260
 It was a 24% risk reduction, about one in 1,000 as well.

1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:39.580
 So when you had estrogen plus MPA,

1:20:39.580 --> 1:20:42.400
 you had a barely statistically significant,

1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:43.900
 the P value was 0.05,

1:20:43.900 --> 1:20:45.900
 so it just hit statistical significance,

1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:49.060
 one in 1,000 cases for breast cancer,

1:20:49.060 --> 1:20:51.760
 and then you had one in 1,000 cases,

1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:56.480
 but P value of 0.07 for reduction of risk of breast cancer,

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:58.320
 which to me suggests that the MPA,

1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:01.020
 the synthetic progesterone, was playing more of a role

1:21:01.020 --> 1:21:02.800
 than anything else.

1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:06.180
 The second thing I point out is oral estrogen,

1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:10.580
 which we no longer use, does increase coagulability.

1:21:10.580 --> 1:21:12.880
 It does increase the ability of the blood

1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:14.300
 to clot a little bit.

1:21:14.300 --> 1:21:17.820
 And when we look at the more recent data on HRT

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:21.980
 using topical estrogen or patches of estrogen,

1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:22.900
 we don't see that at all.

1:21:22.900 --> 1:21:24.060
 In fact, we see the opposite now.

1:21:24.060 --> 1:21:25.340
 So now we see the risk of heart disease

1:21:25.340 --> 1:21:27.740
 going down in women with estradiol.

1:21:27.740 --> 1:21:30.060
 And some women will be arriving to those treatments

1:21:30.060 --> 1:21:32.620
 with mutations and things like factor V Leiden

1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:34.420
 and other clotting factors.

1:21:34.420 --> 1:21:37.500
 Is it appropriate to say that everyone,

1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:39.420
 both male and female, should know whether or not

1:21:39.420 --> 1:21:41.940
 they have mutant forms of factor V Leiden?

1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:44.380
 You know, we don't typically test people for factor V.

1:21:44.380 --> 1:21:45.340
 My wife actually has it,

1:21:45.340 --> 1:21:47.780
 but we didn't learn it until she had help syndrome,

1:21:47.780 --> 1:21:50.340
 giving birth to our first daughter.

1:21:50.340 --> 1:21:54.300
 But we kind of look for more family history reason

1:21:54.300 --> 1:21:56.080
 to be testing things like that.

1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:57.420
 We take a pretty detailed family history,

1:21:57.420 --> 1:21:59.900
 so we'll kind of look for clotting issues there.

1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:04.900
 What about, so your reflex nowadays is to put women

1:22:05.700 --> 1:22:08.700
 on these topical estrogen therapies.

1:22:08.700 --> 1:22:10.780
 Well, it's to basically have the discussion, right?

1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:12.740
 So here's where we still struggle, right?

1:22:12.740 --> 1:22:15.820
 Is, you know, we, if it were up to me,

1:22:15.820 --> 1:22:20.820
 I'd prefer for a woman's HRT to be provided by her GYN

1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:22.660
 because we want to be able to work in partnership

1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:24.580
 with the GYN who we would like to see

1:22:24.580 --> 1:22:27.500
 an endometrial ultrasound done every year.

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:29.380
 That's, you know, some would argue that's overkill,

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:30.820
 but you know, we think she'd be shoving

1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:32.460
 a pap smear every year as well.

1:22:32.460 --> 1:22:34.020
 So if we're looking at the cervix,

1:22:34.020 --> 1:22:35.100
 we want to look at the endometrium.

1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:37.100
 We want to make sure the lining isn't too thick.

1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:38.020
 The other thing I should say, Andrew,

1:22:38.020 --> 1:22:41.660
 is today we now realize that not all women

1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:44.780
 can tolerate, pardon me, progesterone.

1:22:44.780 --> 1:22:45.820
 So you have to be careful.

1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:48.580
 So assuming, again, a woman still has her uterus,

1:22:48.580 --> 1:22:51.160
 the estrogen solves most of the problems,

1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:52.320
 but then you have to decide,

1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:54.340
 can she tolerate the progesterone?

1:22:54.340 --> 1:22:56.340
 And it needs to be, if given systemically,

1:22:56.340 --> 1:22:58.500
 like 100 to 200 milligrams.

1:22:58.500 --> 1:23:01.180
 And for some women, that is a life-saving intervention.

1:23:01.180 --> 1:23:02.540
 I mean, they start sleeping better,

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.700
 their hair gets thicker, they feel better,

1:23:04.700 --> 1:23:07.500
 but for some women, it literally drives them crazy.

1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:09.980
 It's probably the reciprocal of what we were seeing

1:23:09.980 --> 1:23:12.060
 in the case of women with PMS.

1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:15.260
 So in those situations, we say, great,

1:23:15.260 --> 1:23:16.740
 we're done with oral progesterone.

1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.300
 We just use a progesterone-coated IUD.

1:23:19.300 --> 1:23:22.740
 So then you get the local progesterone in the uterus

1:23:22.740 --> 1:23:25.980
 for protection in the systemic estrogen.

1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:26.860
 Fascinating.

1:23:26.860 --> 1:23:30.420
 What about oral contraception in women?

1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:37.180
 So the use of estrogen chronically through college years

1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:39.720
 or 20s, 30s, maybe even teens, who knows?

1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:44.360
 What's known about the long-term effects, if any?

1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:45.200
 I got to be honest with you.

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:47.100
 I don't think I know enough to comment on it.

1:23:47.100 --> 1:23:48.820
 It's not something that really impacts

1:23:48.820 --> 1:23:50.260
 my patient population.

1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:53.540
 You know, at least in what I see,

1:23:53.540 --> 1:23:58.340
 more women are using IUDs for contraception than OCs.

1:23:58.340 --> 1:24:01.900
 I mean, we use OCs sometimes in women

1:24:01.900 --> 1:24:05.340
 who are premenopausal for symptomatic control,

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:08.420
 but we'll typically use like a low, low estrogen,

1:24:08.420 --> 1:24:11.420
 so a very low synthetic estrogen,

1:24:11.420 --> 1:24:13.180
 which I don't like using these very much,

1:24:13.180 --> 1:24:14.140
 but if it's the only thing that we can get

1:24:14.140 --> 1:24:15.480
 to control certain symptoms,

1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:17.700
 and we'll use it like half her cycle.

1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:22.700
 But it's typically not something we're that experienced with.

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:24.680
 What about testosterone?

1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.660
 Because you mentioned that nanogram per mil,

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.040
 when you set everything to the same,

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:34.880
 I guess it's nanogram per deciliter,

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:37.160
 as it would be to kind of normalize everything.

1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:38.000
 First picogram per mole.

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.400
 Right, yeah, and so what Peter was pointing out before

1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:42.640
 is that you look at your charts

1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:43.960
 and they're all in these different measures,

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:45.160
 and so when you normalize,

1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:47.400
 testosterone is actually higher than estrogen

1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:49.100
 in women, that's a surprise to me.

1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:53.480
 Do you prescribe testosterone therapy to women ever?

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:56.700
 We do sometimes, but I do it with much more caution

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:58.600
 because I don't have the data, right?

1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:02.520
 So what we'll say is, look,

1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:04.740
 I mean, we're now really outside of an area

1:25:04.740 --> 1:25:06.440
 where I can point to a lot of data.

1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:09.320
 Like when it comes to estrogen and progesterone,

1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.820
 I'll happily go toe to toe with anybody

1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:14.160
 who wants to make the case that it's dangerous.

1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:16.720
 Similarly, when it comes to using testosterone in men,

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:20.120
 I'll spend all day, and I can go through that literature

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:21.840
 until the other person cries

1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:24.280
 and wants to just call uncle, right?

1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:25.100
 When it comes to-

1:25:25.100 --> 1:25:26.000
 And then you prescribe them testosterone.

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.800
 When it comes to estrogen in,

1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:30.460
 testosterone in women don't have that data,

1:25:30.460 --> 1:25:32.760
 and I'd love to see that trial done.

1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:35.560
 So what's the sweet spot?

1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:37.120
 How do we reconcile that?

1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:39.820
 So it's not something I consider standard,

1:25:39.820 --> 1:25:41.720
 and basically, if a woman is,

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:44.960
 if her testosterone, first of all, is staggeringly low,

1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:46.680
 and again, even though her testosterone is low

1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:48.740
 compared to a male, we still have a range.

1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:50.700
 So if it's really at the bottom of that range,

1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:53.080
 she's really having difficulty putting on muscle mass

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:55.520
 and really complaining of low libido,

1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:56.900
 I think in that situation,

1:25:56.900 --> 1:25:59.000
 we'll go ahead and use topical testosterone

1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:03.320
 and replace her to a level

1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:05.820
 that is still physiologically normal.

1:26:05.820 --> 1:26:08.080
 Yeah, that's key, because when people hear HRT,

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:10.320
 they think about super physiological,

1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:11.240
 seems to be the term-

1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:14.080
 Yeah, like I've never seen a single symptom

1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:16.160
 in a single woman that I've put testosterone on

1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:18.480
 in terms of acne, body hair, things like that.

1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:20.880
 Those are real symptoms that you have to be aware of,

1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:24.720
 but clitoral enlargement and things like that,

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:28.040
 that doesn't happen under physiologic normal conditions.

1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:30.360
 I'd love to talk a little bit

1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:33.040
 about hormone replacement therapy in men.

1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:36.240
 When one looks on social media and the internet,

1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:40.280
 there seems to be a younger and younger cohort of guys,

1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:43.160
 people in their teens and 20s, showing up to the table,

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:45.840
 thinking that injecting testosterone,

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:48.100
 sapienate or taking Anavar or whatever it is,

1:26:48.100 --> 1:26:49.580
 is going to be the right idea.

1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:52.720
 They mainly seem to be focused on cosmetic effects.

1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.120
 I'm not a physician, so I can't say whether or not

1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:56.860
 they were actually hypogonadal, et cetera,

1:26:56.860 --> 1:27:00.000
 but it seems to me, again, correct me if I'm wrong,

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:03.600
 but it seems to me that similar to the Atiyah's rule

1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:05.300
 as it relates to longevity,

1:27:05.300 --> 1:27:08.480
 that we could come up with a broad contour rule

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:11.640
 in which if a male of any age

1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:16.640
 is not trying to get decent sleep, exercise appropriately,

1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:18.960
 appropriate nutrition, minding their social connections,

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.120
 et cetera, et cetera,

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:22.980
 the idea of going straight to testosterone

1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:24.420
 seems like a bad idea.

1:27:24.420 --> 1:27:28.160
 That said, just like with depression and antidepressants,

1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:30.800
 there is a kind of a cliff after which

1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:35.240
 low enough testosterone or low enough serotonin

1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:37.240
 prevents people from sleeping, exercise,

1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:38.420
 social connection, et cetera.

1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:39.940
 So I do want to acknowledge that.

1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:43.660
 But with that in mind, how do you think about,

1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:47.760
 and perhaps occasionally prescribe and direct your patients

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:50.400
 in terms of hormone replacement therapy in men,

1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.080
 person in their thirties, person in their forties,

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:55.680
 who's doing almost all the other things correctly?

1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:58.980
 What sorts of levels do you think are meaningful?

1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:01.400
 Because the range is tremendous in terms of blood tests,

1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:03.040
 300 nanograms per deciliter,

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.420
 I think on the low end now in the US,

1:28:04.420 --> 1:28:07.840
 all the way up to 900 or 1200, that's an enormous range.

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:09.740
 What are some of the other hormones you like to look at?

1:28:09.740 --> 1:28:12.480
 Estrogen, DHT, and so on.

1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:15.780
 So a lot to unpack there.

1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:18.440
 So let's start with the ranges, right?

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:23.060
 So the ranges you gave are for total testosterone,

1:28:23.060 --> 1:28:26.920
 of course, and we don't spend a lot of time looking at that.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.840
 I used to spend more time looking at total and free

1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:35.000
 when I used more tricks to modulate it.

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.160
 So I'm actually far more simple in my manipulation

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:41.200
 of testosterone today than I was six or seven years ago.

1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:44.680
 Six or seven years ago, I mean, we were,

1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:49.120
 we would use a microdose of Anovar to lower SHBG

1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:51.040
 in a person who had normal testosterone,

1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:52.480
 but low free testosterone.

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:55.640
 What was a low dose of Anovar in that context?

1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:00.120
 10 milligrams, subling, two to three times a week.

1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:02.140
 Anovar basically being DHT.

1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:04.160
 Oxandrolone.

1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:05.000
 Oxandrolone, yeah, exactly.

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.660
 And again, we're not recommending this.

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:08.360
 This is actually, if you're playing a competitive sport,

1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:09.800
 can get you banned from that sport.

1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:13.080
 It can also get you banned from having children

1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:14.080
 if you do it incorrectly.

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:18.160
 Yeah, so a microdose of this has to be small enough

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:20.240
 that it doesn't impair your body's ability

1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:24.360
 to make testosterone, but Anovar has such a high affinity

1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:28.240
 for SHBG that it basically distracts your SHBG

1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:30.080
 from binding your testosterone.

1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:31.080
 Freeing up testosterone.

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:31.920
 That's exactly right.

1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:34.600
 So the goal was how do I just give you more free testosterone?

1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:37.640
 So if a patient shows up and they've got a total

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.960
 testosterone of 900 nanograms per deciliter,

1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:42.320
 which would place them at, depending on the scale

1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:43.640
 you look at, the scale we look at,

1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:47.000
 that would place you at about the 70th percentile,

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.100
 but your free testosterone is eight nanograms

1:29:51.100 --> 1:29:52.440
 per deciliter.

1:29:52.440 --> 1:29:53.280
 So that's pretty bad.

1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:56.000
 That means you're less than 1% free.

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:59.000
 A guy should be about 2% free T.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.940
 So that dude should be closer to 16 to 18 nanograms

1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:04.640
 per deciliter.

1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:06.560
 So in that situation that I just gave you,

1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:08.400
 his SHBG is really high.

1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:11.880
 His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range.

1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:12.720
 That's very high.

1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:15.240
 Because I think the upper range is somewhere around 55, 56.

1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:16.580
 Exactly.

1:30:16.580 --> 1:30:21.040
 So we would first back stall for what's driving his SHBG.

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:22.720
 So there's basically three hormones.

1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.380
 So genetics plays a huge role in this.

1:30:24.380 --> 1:30:27.380
 There's no question that just out of the box,

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:30.440
 people have a different set point for SHBG.

1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:31.720
 Mine is incredibly low.

1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:35.880
 My SHBG is like kind of in the 30s, 20s to 30s.

1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:37.480
 But from a hormone perspective, there's

1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:39.400
 basically three hormones that run it.

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:42.960
 So estradiol being probably the most important,

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:45.620
 insulin, and thyroxine.

1:30:45.620 --> 1:30:47.400
 So we're going to look at all of those

1:30:47.400 --> 1:30:49.280
 and decide if any of those are playing a role.

1:30:49.280 --> 1:30:50.880
 So insulin suppresses it.

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.360
 So this is actually the great irony

1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:55.380
 of helping a person get metabolically healthy,

1:30:55.380 --> 1:30:56.920
 is in the short run, you can actually

1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:00.300
 lower their free testosterone, all things equal.

1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:03.440
 Because as insulin comes down, SHBG goes up.

1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:05.160
 And if testosterone hasn't gone up with it,

1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:06.960
 you're lowering free testosterone.

1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:10.000
 So somebody who goes on a very low carbohydrate diet

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.700
 in an attempt to drop some water and drop some weight

1:31:12.700 --> 1:31:14.480
 is going to increase their SHBG.

1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:15.320
 Yeah, if their insulin goes down, they're tough.

1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:17.600
 Bind up testosterone, less free testosterone.

1:31:18.600 --> 1:31:20.640
 I can tell the carnivore diet people

1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:24.020
 are going to be coming after me with bone marrow in hand.

1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:25.940
 But then again, after this discussion

1:31:25.940 --> 1:31:27.540
 extends a little further, I'm sure the vegans

1:31:27.540 --> 1:31:29.320
 will be coming after me with celery stalks.

1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:32.360
 So it's, so then the same as with estradiol.

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:33.600
 So except in the opposite direction.

1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:36.500
 So higher estradiol is higher SHBG.

1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:39.600
 So again, occasionally you'll see a guy

1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:41.520
 with incredible, normal testosterone,

1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:45.760
 but he's a very high aromatase activity person.

1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:47.400
 So he has a lot of the enzyme

1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:50.920
 that converts testosterone into estradiol.

1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:53.880
 You can lower estradiol a bit with an aromatase inhibitor,

1:31:53.880 --> 1:31:55.260
 and that can bring down SHBG.

1:31:55.260 --> 1:31:57.140
 Now again, these things individually

1:31:57.140 --> 1:31:59.840
 are rarely enough to move the needle.

1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:01.120
 The last is thyroxine.

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:03.380
 So if you have a person whose thyroid is out of whack,

1:32:03.380 --> 1:32:05.360
 you have to fix that before you,

1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:06.640
 if their T4 is out of whack,

1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:09.160
 you're going to interfere with SHBG.

1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:10.220
 There are also some supplements,

1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:11.700
 which I think you've probably talked about these

1:32:11.700 --> 1:32:12.540
 on the podcast.

1:32:12.540 --> 1:32:14.060
 I feel like I've heard you talk about these on the podcast.

1:32:14.060 --> 1:32:15.680
 Yeah, there are a few that will adjust.

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:16.900
 You know, there is this idea.

1:32:16.900 --> 1:32:19.640
 Now there's a much better review that just came out.

1:32:19.640 --> 1:32:20.480
 I'll send it to you.

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:21.300
 I'd love your thoughts on it.

1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:24.040
 And I've been perusing it line by line,

1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:26.760
 but I love input from experts like you

1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:31.480
 on the use of Tonga Ali for reducing SHBG.

1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:34.960
 In my experience, it does free up some testosterone

1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:37.560
 by which mechanism it isn't exactly clear,

1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:39.760
 and the effects aren't that dramatic, right?

1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:41.480
 There are probably multiple effects.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:43.380
 For all we know, it increases libido,

1:32:43.380 --> 1:32:46.660
 and it does generally by way of increasing estrogens slightly

1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:48.700
 which can also increase libido in some individuals.

1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:51.060
 So we don't know the exact mode of action.

1:32:51.060 --> 1:32:51.920
 So we've talked about a few.

1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:54.120
 The one that a few years back people were claiming

1:32:54.120 --> 1:32:58.720
 could reduce SHBG was stinging nettles.

1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:01.360
 Stinging nettle, well, urine seems to be,

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:03.040
 urinating seems to be coming up multiple times

1:33:03.040 --> 1:33:05.560
 on this podcast for whatever reason.

1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:06.580
 Stinging nettle extract,

1:33:06.580 --> 1:33:09.360
 I took the most pronounced effect of that

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:11.960
 was you could basically urinate over a car

1:33:11.960 --> 1:33:13.000
 when taking SHBG.

1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:16.560
 What the underlying mechanism of that was, I do not know.

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:17.520
 I took it for a short while.

1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:20.320
 It didn't drop my SHBG very much,

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:23.360
 but it did drop by DHT sufficiently

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:25.040
 so that I stopped taking it.

1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:28.060
 I do not like anything that impedes DHT.

1:33:28.060 --> 1:33:30.280
 I don't care if my hairline retreats.

1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:31.560
 I don't care about any of that.

1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:36.560
 DHT to me is something to be hoveted and held onto

1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:38.460
 because you feel so much better

1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:40.720
 when your DHT is in the appropriate range.

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:42.200
 And I'd love your thoughts on that at some point.

1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:44.520
 Yeah, again, it really depends on the guy

1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:46.840
 and it depends on what risk you're trying to manage, right?

1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:49.020
 So prostate size starts to become

1:33:49.020 --> 1:33:50.600
 one of the issues with DHT.

1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:55.600
 Luckily, my prostate-specific antigen is low, and DHT,

1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:56.920
 the things that I know can reduce it

1:33:56.920 --> 1:33:59.160
 are things like finasteride, Propecia, things like that.

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:02.600
 So things that people take to try and avoid hair loss

1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:04.560
 can dramatically reduce DHT

1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:07.060
 and lead to all sorts of terrible sexual side effects,

1:34:07.060 --> 1:34:08.840
 mood-based side effects, et cetera.

1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:11.080
 But yeah, so I'm not aware of anything

1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:12.600
 that can be taken in supplement form

1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:14.680
 that can really profoundly drop SHBG.

1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:16.920
 Yeah, we don't spend much attention on it anymore.

1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:18.880
 Basically, I used to have

1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:20.960
 a much more complicated differential diagnosis

1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:21.800
 eight years ago.

1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:24.440
 I would drive patients nuts

1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:26.440
 with the whiteboard diagrams I would draw for them,

1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:27.640
 when in the end, I think they were just like,

1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:29.900
 dude, just what do I need to take?

1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:31.340
 Today, we take a much more simple approach.

1:34:31.340 --> 1:34:32.480
 So the first question is,

1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:33.760
 should you or should you

1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:35.280
 have your free testosterone being higher?

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:36.800
 That's the metric I care about,

1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:38.880
 is free testosterone is the first most important,

1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:40.440
 the second most important is estradiol.

1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:41.280
 And sorry to interrupt,

1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:43.280
 but you said if you look at your total testosterone,

1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:45.320
 you want the free T to be about 2% of your total.

1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:46.880
 Well, it should be, right?

1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:48.360
 Now, I might not change that anymore.

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:50.720
 So in other words, if a guy's at 1%,

1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:53.440
 then I know I have to really boost his total testosterone.

1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:54.280
 If he's only going to get

1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:56.720
 one to one and a half percent of it converted to free,

1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:57.880
 I need to boost him.

1:34:57.880 --> 1:34:59.840
 And that's why I don't care if he's outside the range.

1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:02.360
 Like I'll have a guy who's free T,

1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:04.820
 I might have to get a guy's total T up to 1,500

1:35:04.820 --> 1:35:06.640
 to get his free T to 18.

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.040
 I see, so free T is the target.

1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:09.400
 I like this approach. Free T is what we treat.

1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:12.020
 And do you still use Anavarix?

1:35:13.020 --> 1:35:13.860
 I don't use Anavarix.

1:35:13.860 --> 1:35:15.720
 Sorry, to try and lower SHBG?

1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:16.560
 I don't, no.

1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:17.760
 Because it's too potent?

1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:19.880
 No, because it's just too complicated for patients.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:23.480
 You know, it's a drug that can't be taken orally,

1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:24.880
 so you have to take it under the tongue.

1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:25.800
 Like a troche or something.

1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:28.080
 Right, but I had one patient once who,

1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:30.920
 even though we told him about 87 times that,

1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:33.320
 he was like swallowing the Anavars and his liver function.

1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:35.000
 And he was like, we're talking 10 milligrams

1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.500
 three times a week is a tiny dose.

1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:39.280
 And three months of him, or whatever,

1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:41.600
 two months of him swallowing that every time

1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:42.980
 tripled his liver function test.

1:35:42.980 --> 1:35:44.600
 So it's like, I was like, you know,

1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:49.600
 it's just not worth the hassle of doing this for perfection.

1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:52.120
 In reality, we can fix this another way.

1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:54.280
 So the first order question is,

1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:57.240
 do we believe clinically you will benefit

1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:00.720
 from normalizing your free testosterone?

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:03.580
 Or taking it to a level that's call it

1:36:03.580 --> 1:36:05.300
 80th to 90th percentile.

1:36:05.300 --> 1:36:09.180
 So upper normal limit of physiologic ranges.

1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.000
 That's the first order question.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.600
 And that's going to come down to symptoms,

1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.800
 and that's going to come down to some biomarkers.

1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:18.280
 I think there's two years ago, was it two years ago,

1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:20.580
 or maybe a year ago, a very good study came out

1:36:20.580 --> 1:36:23.920
 that looked at prediabetic men,

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:25.520
 you've probably talked about this study,

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:29.480
 and looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal

1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:30.680
 with and without testosterone.

1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:33.120
 And the evidence was overwhelmingly clear.

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:36.560
 Testosterone improves glycemic control.

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:37.920
 Testosterone improves insulin signaling.

1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:39.720
 This shouldn't be surprising, by the way,

1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:42.420
 given the role muscles play as a glucose reservoir

1:36:42.420 --> 1:36:43.720
 in a glucose sink.

1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:45.700
 So now I include that as one of the things

1:36:45.700 --> 1:36:49.300
 that we will consider as a factor for using testosterone.

1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:50.800
 Now, again, it's not the only one,

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.780
 so you can accomplish that with exercise,

1:36:52.780 --> 1:36:53.880
 you can accomplish that with these other things,

1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:55.760
 but then you get into a little bit of the vicious cycle

1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:58.240
 of will having a normalized testosterone

1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:00.800
 facilitate you doing those things better?

1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:03.700
 So let's just assume we come to the decision

1:37:03.700 --> 1:37:06.880
 that this person is a good candidate

1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:09.200
 for testosterone replacement therapy.

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:12.200
 The next question is what's the method

1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:13.040
 that we're going to do it?

1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:15.440
 Are we going to do it indirectly or directly?

1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:19.580
 Now, we used to use a lot of Clomid in our practice,

1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:22.320
 and have you talked about Clomid on the podcast?

1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:23.720
 I haven't talked too much about it.

1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:26.120
 No, we've talked a little bit about the fact

1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:28.400
 that some people taking things like anastrozole

1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:32.480
 to reduce aromatase activity can potentially run

1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:34.720
 into trouble because they think,

1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:37.720
 oh, well, more testosterone good, lower estrogen bad,

1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:40.080
 and then they end up with issues like joint pain,

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:42.880
 memory issues, and severe drops in libido,

1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:43.720
 and I think a lot of the reason why.

1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:45.440
 And even fat accumulation.

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:49.160
 So if estrogen is too low, you can develop adiposity

1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:50.240
 in a way that you wouldn't otherwise.

1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:52.240
 There's a great New England Journal paper,

1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:53.360
 it's probably 10 years old now,

1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:56.920
 that looked at, I believe it was five different doses

1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:58.040
 of testosterone siponate.

1:37:58.040 --> 1:37:59.640
 So these men were chemically castrated

1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:01.200
 and divided into 10 groups.

1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:02.240
 It's pretty remarkable.

1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:03.480
 Somebody signed up for this study.

1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:07.080
 Yeah, so you were with and without anastrozole

1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:09.080
 and five doses of testosterone.

1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:12.480
 So now you basically had five testosterone levels,

1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:15.400
 plus or minus high or low estradiol.

1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:17.120
 And the results were really clear

1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:19.320
 that the higher your testosterone

1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:21.200
 and the more your estradiol was in kind of

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:24.280
 that 30 to 50 range, the better you were.

1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:26.080
 So if estrogen was too low,

1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:28.160
 even in the presence of high testosterone,

1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:30.800
 the outcomes were less significant.

1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:32.920
 And this is 30 to 50 nanograms per deciliter,

1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:35.720
 not 30 to 50% of one's testosterone.

1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:36.560
 Okay, great.

1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:39.320
 Okay, so we haven't talked, but Clomid is,

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.000
 no, we have not talked a lot about Clomid.

1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.560
 I'd love to get your thoughts on Clomid.

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:45.160
 So Clomiphene is a fertility drug.

1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:46.720
 It's a synthetic hormone.

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:48.920
 It's actually two drugs, M-Clomiphene

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:50.840
 and I forget the other one.

1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:55.840
 And it tells the pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.

1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:03.680
 So the advantage of Clomid is it's oral

1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:06.120
 and it's meant to be taken orally.

1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:09.560
 So a typical starting dose would be like 50 milligrams

1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:10.560
 three times a week.

1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:15.240
 And if you do that, you'll notice in most men,

1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:17.720
 especially young men, FSH, LH goes up.

1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:19.560
 In any man, the FSH and LH go up.

1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:21.760
 But if a man still has testicular reserve,

1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:24.320
 he'll make lots of testosterone in response to that.

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:27.600
 Because that's the first order question

1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:30.140
 we're trying to answer is do you,

1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:34.080
 is your failure to make testosterone central or peripheral?

1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:36.440
 Yeah, and I think just one point out again,

1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:37.840
 correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding

1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:41.560
 is that a lot of the drugs that we're talking about,

1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:43.760
 the synthetic compounds, testosterone, estrogen,

1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:46.400
 things related to growth hormone, et cetera,

1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:49.840
 were discovered and designed in order to treat

1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:52.100
 and excuse me, in order to isolate and treat

1:39:52.100 --> 1:39:53.440
 exactly these kinds of syndromes,

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:56.160
 whether or not it was the hypothalamus, the pituitary

1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:59.680
 or the target tissue, the ovaries or the testes, correct?

1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:00.520
 Correct, yeah.

1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:02.400
 I mean, I think the easiest way to go about doing this

1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:04.600
 is just give the hormone that's missing

1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:07.640
 without attention to where the deficiency is.

1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:12.200
 Why this becomes relevant is if you have a 35-year-old guy

1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:15.680
 whose testosterone is low, but you can demonstrate

1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:17.960
 that it's low because he's not getting enough

1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:19.800
 of a signal from the pituitary,

1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:22.040
 why would you bother giving him more testosterone

1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:24.080
 when he has the, he has the Leydig cells

1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:25.780
 and the Sertuli cells to make testosterone,

1:40:25.780 --> 1:40:27.020
 he just needs the signal.

1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:29.780
 Sometimes, though not always,

1:40:29.780 --> 1:40:32.800
 just a course of Clomid can wake him up

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:35.160
 and he's back to making normal testosterone.

1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:36.800
 So he'll do this three times a week,

1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:39.980
 50 milligrams three times a week for a short course

1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:40.820
 and then- Yeah, we would do it

1:40:40.820 --> 1:40:43.080
 for eight to 12 weeks and then we reevaluate.

1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:46.760
 And estrogen and testosterone will increase in parallel.

1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:49.040
 Yes, and again, it depends.

1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:51.560
 Aromatase activity is dependent on how much body fat

1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:56.060
 you have and genetics and if estradiol gets too high,

1:40:56.060 --> 1:40:58.620
 we think if it gets over about 55, 60,

1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:01.360
 we will give microdoses of an estradiol.

1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:03.120
 But it has to be real microdoses.

1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.600
 I mean, you cannot pound people with an estradiol.

1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:10.520
 To give you perspective, the sort of on-label use,

1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:12.960
 like if you just go to a pharmacy and order an estradiol,

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:15.200
 you're gonna get one milligram tablets.

1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:16.840
 Like we can't give anybody a milligram.

1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:18.200
 They'll feel like garbage.

1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:21.080
 We have to have it compounded at 0.1 milligrams

1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:24.100
 and we might give a patient 0.1 two to three times a week.

1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:26.720
 That would be a big dose of an estradiol.

1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:30.160
 Yeah, I think that the typical TRT clinic out there

1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:33.680
 is giving 200 milligrams per mil,

1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:36.280
 one mil, 200 milligrams of testosterone once every two weeks

1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:39.780
 and then hitting people with multiple milligrams

1:41:39.780 --> 1:41:42.320
 of an estradiol and they're all over the place.

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:43.700
 I've never really understood.

1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:45.360
 I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised,

1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:47.840
 but it kind of blows my mind that these TRT clinics

1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:49.560
 are up all over the place given how bad,

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:50.800
 I mean, I see the results

1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:53.440
 because I have patients that come from them

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:56.280
 and I don't understand like why they're so incompetent.

1:41:56.280 --> 1:41:57.800
 I actually think it's worse than that.

1:41:57.800 --> 1:41:59.840
 I think that they simply don't understand

1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:03.760
 and don't care because it's a pill mill

1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:04.860
 and it's a money mill.

1:42:04.860 --> 1:42:07.160
 I think that nowadays it seems almost everybody

1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:09.820
 who's doing TRT is taking lower doses more frequently

1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:12.240
 every other day or twice a week dividing the dose

1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:14.640
 and being very, very careful with these estrogen

1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:16.100
 or aromatase blockers.

1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:20.160
 Most of our patients do not take aromatase inhibitors.

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:21.000
 It's not needed.

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.760
 It's really only the high aromatizers that need it.

1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:27.260
 And so, yeah, when we'll talk about testosterone,

1:42:27.260 --> 1:42:28.900
 we'll talk about dosing there because I agree,

1:42:28.900 --> 1:42:30.620
 the more frequently you can take it, the better.

1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:32.880
 And frankly, you don't need to go more frequently

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:34.460
 than twice a week.

1:42:34.460 --> 1:42:35.700
 Because it's so slow.

1:42:35.700 --> 1:42:37.300
 Yeah, the half-life of the drug is,

1:42:37.300 --> 1:42:38.580
 I think it's about three and a half days

1:42:38.580 --> 1:42:39.940
 is the plasma half-life or something like that.

1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:41.300
 It could be off a little bit,

1:42:41.300 --> 1:42:45.020
 but twice week dosing is really nice.

1:42:45.020 --> 1:42:49.380
 So if you go to like a testosterone clinic

1:42:49.380 --> 1:42:51.540
 that's giving you 200 every two weeks,

1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:54.520
 50 twice a week is the same total dose,

1:42:54.520 --> 1:42:56.240
 which by the way, is a physiologic dose.

1:42:56.240 --> 1:42:58.660
 That's not going to give somebody

1:42:58.660 --> 1:42:59.980
 any of the side effects you would see.

1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:01.560
 You're not gonna get acne with that.

1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:03.580
 You're not gonna get gynecomastia.

1:43:03.580 --> 1:43:04.500
 You're not gonna get any things.

1:43:04.500 --> 1:43:06.220
 The only real side effect you get from that

1:43:06.220 --> 1:43:08.340
 is you will get testicular atrophy.

1:43:08.340 --> 1:43:09.780
 That is enough to suppress.

1:43:09.780 --> 1:43:12.120
 Yeah, to maintain fertility,

1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:13.620
 what do you typically do for them?

1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:14.780
 Well, so this is where,

1:43:14.780 --> 1:43:16.340
 so I'll finish the story on Clomid

1:43:16.340 --> 1:43:18.180
 because we currently do not use Clomid.

1:43:18.180 --> 1:43:22.460
 And that's due to a really interesting observation

1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:25.860
 that we made that I don't think has been reported

1:43:25.860 --> 1:43:27.300
 in the literature yet,

1:43:27.300 --> 1:43:31.460
 which is that Clomid was increasing levels of a sterol

1:43:31.460 --> 1:43:34.580
 that we also happen to measure called desmosterol.

1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:36.020
 I'm not familiar with that.

1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:39.580
 So in the way that cholesterol is made,

1:43:39.580 --> 1:43:43.360
 it's made by, there's two pathways that make cholesterol.

1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:45.860
 So it starts like with two carbon subunits,

1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:48.300
 like acetyl-CoA, and it kind of marches down a pathway,

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:52.620
 bifurcates, and cholesterol is the finished product of both.

1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:54.740
 But in one of those pathways,

1:43:54.740 --> 1:43:58.500
 the molecule right before cholesterol is called desmosterol.

1:43:58.500 --> 1:44:00.740
 In the other pathway, it's called lithosterol.

1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:04.820
 So we constantly measure lithosterol and desmosterol

1:44:04.820 --> 1:44:06.820
 because we want to know how much cholesterol

1:44:06.820 --> 1:44:08.620
 is being synthesized in the body,

1:44:08.620 --> 1:44:10.820
 not just what your cholesterol is.

1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:13.820
 We wanna know how much cholesterol you reabsorb.

1:44:13.820 --> 1:44:15.660
 And those markers are really important to us

1:44:15.660 --> 1:44:19.040
 when we're looking at cardiovascular disease risk.

1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:22.300
 So when we gave patients Clomid,

1:44:22.300 --> 1:44:26.840
 we were noticing a almost universal rise

1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:28.760
 in their desmosterol levels.

1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:31.840
 Now, the most obvious explanation for that,

1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:33.740
 though the last time I looked,

1:44:33.740 --> 1:44:35.980
 I couldn't find clear explanation for this

1:44:35.980 --> 1:44:38.580
 in any of the clinical trials

1:44:38.580 --> 1:44:40.260
 that led to the approval of Clomid.

1:44:40.260 --> 1:44:41.700
 So I don't know if it was described.

1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:43.340
 In fact, maybe it wasn't known.

1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:46.100
 I suspect it is inhibiting the enzyme,

1:44:46.100 --> 1:44:48.520
 which I think is called Delta 24 desaturase,

1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:51.480
 that turns desmosterol into cholesterol.

1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:53.180
 Makes sense if you inhibit that enzyme,

1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:55.560
 you're gonna see a rise in desmosterol.

1:44:56.440 --> 1:44:58.420
 This wouldn't have been a concern to me

1:44:58.420 --> 1:45:00.160
 if not for the fact that Tom Dayspring,

1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:01.420
 who's one of the physicians we work with,

1:45:01.420 --> 1:45:02.880
 who's one of the world's experts in lipids,

1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:06.220
 pointed out a very obscure story,

1:45:06.220 --> 1:45:09.760
 which was that the very first drug ever approved

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:12.580
 to treat cardiovascular disease,

1:45:12.580 --> 1:45:14.860
 at least to treat hypercholesterolemia,

1:45:14.860 --> 1:45:17.480
 was a drug that attacked the same enzyme.

1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:21.740
 So this was in the early 1960s, I believe,

1:45:21.740 --> 1:45:23.640
 maybe the mid-60s, this drug was approved

1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:26.540
 and it lowered cholesterol.

1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:28.780
 And it was approved on the basis of lowering cholesterol.

1:45:28.780 --> 1:45:32.140
 Now, today, no drug for ASCVD is approved

1:45:32.140 --> 1:45:34.140
 on the basis of it lowering cholesterol.

1:45:34.140 --> 1:45:35.420
 That's not a high enough bar.

1:45:35.420 --> 1:45:36.980
 You have to reduce events.

1:45:36.980 --> 1:45:38.440
 They actually have to show that you're preventing

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:40.740
 heart attacks and death.

1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:42.500
 But at the time, it was like, hey, it lowers cholesterol,

1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:43.700
 it's gotta be good.

1:45:43.700 --> 1:45:45.860
 Well, in the late 60s, it was pulled from the market

1:45:45.860 --> 1:45:47.860
 because events were going up.

1:45:47.860 --> 1:45:50.780
 So cholesterol was coming down, events were going up.

1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:52.460
 How could that be?

1:45:52.460 --> 1:45:53.600
 We don't know.

1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:58.220
 What we are suspecting is that desmostrol,

1:45:58.220 --> 1:46:02.900
 which is still a sterol, was potentially more damaging

1:46:02.900 --> 1:46:05.940
 and created more oxidative stress in the endothelium,

1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:07.780
 in the subendothelial space than cholesterol.

1:46:07.780 --> 1:46:08.600
 I see.

1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:10.860
 Which would at least suggest to us,

1:46:10.860 --> 1:46:13.020
 and again, we're taking a lot of leaps here,

1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:15.140
 that maybe having high desmostrol,

1:46:15.140 --> 1:46:17.420
 very high desmostrol, is not a good thing.

1:46:18.340 --> 1:46:20.980
 And so once we kind of pieced all that together

1:46:20.980 --> 1:46:22.620
 a few years ago, we were like, yeah,

1:46:22.620 --> 1:46:24.820
 we're just not gonna prescribe Clomid anymore.

1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:30.740
 And we then switched to HCG,

1:46:30.740 --> 1:46:33.340
 which we used to use sometimes instead of Clomid,

1:46:33.340 --> 1:46:35.100
 but it's more cumbersome to work with.

1:46:35.100 --> 1:46:36.260
 It needs to be refrigerated.

1:46:36.260 --> 1:46:38.100
 It's a much more fragile molecule.

1:46:38.100 --> 1:46:39.300
 Yeah, I think we talked about this once.

1:46:39.300 --> 1:46:42.220
 It's almost like if you accidentally knock over

1:46:42.220 --> 1:46:45.580
 the little bottle, it's basically gone bad.

1:46:45.580 --> 1:46:47.140
 Travel with it is very challenging.

1:46:47.140 --> 1:46:48.820
 Can't travel with it.

1:46:48.820 --> 1:46:49.660
 It's a needle.

1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:51.300
 It's an injection, sub-Q.

1:46:51.300 --> 1:46:52.540
 So easy to administer.

1:46:52.540 --> 1:46:53.940
 It's not IM or anything like that,

1:46:53.940 --> 1:46:55.840
 but it's just more of a hassle factor.

1:46:56.860 --> 1:47:00.140
 But that said, it has the benefit that Clomid does,

1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:02.580
 which is it preserves testicular function.

1:47:02.580 --> 1:47:05.180
 It preserves testicular volume.

1:47:05.180 --> 1:47:07.700
 So bodybuilders will often use this

1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:09.500
 in their post-cycle therapy

1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:11.780
 as a way to kind of recover function.

1:47:11.780 --> 1:47:15.180
 And we would just use it now as ongoing therapy

1:47:15.180 --> 1:47:17.940
 for a guy who still has testicular reserve.

1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:19.680
 So on its own, no testosterone,

1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:21.520
 no aromatase inhibitor, nothing,

1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:23.900
 just a way to crank out a bit more testosterone

1:47:23.900 --> 1:47:26.380
 from the testes, maybe some additional estrogen also.

1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:28.140
 And HCG is a different model.

1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:30.900
 HCG is just an analog of luteinizing hormone.

1:47:30.900 --> 1:47:33.280
 So it's basically like giving them luteinizing hormone.

1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:36.160
 So it's gonna crush endogenous luteinizing hormone levels,

1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:37.000
 right, because it's-

1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.780
 It's really, yeah, and it,

1:47:39.780 --> 1:47:41.980
 you don't really see much of an impact on LH,

1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:45.420
 but you do see endogenous testosterone production go down.

1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:46.340
 Actually, no, I correct that.

1:47:46.340 --> 1:47:49.940
 Both FSH and LH will go down on a high enough dose, yep.

1:47:49.940 --> 1:47:52.500
 Just as a mention, and here I'm not making recommendations,

1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:55.580
 but one supplement I've talked a lot about publicly

1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:58.700
 is Fidogia agrestis, which is this weird Nigerian shrub

1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:00.380
 that does- You're talking about this

1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:01.220
 on Tim's podcast.

1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:03.100
 On Tim's podcast and Joe's podcast,

1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:05.600
 and there was a bit of a backlash

1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:07.980
 because it does turn out that at high doses

1:48:07.980 --> 1:48:12.340
 in rodent studies, it can cause some toxicity to the testes,

1:48:12.340 --> 1:48:14.500
 but at lower doses,

1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:16.620
 it does seem to increase luteinizing hormone.

1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:17.520
 And after talking about this,

1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:18.380
 a number of people went out there,

1:48:18.380 --> 1:48:19.620
 did pre and post blood work,

1:48:19.620 --> 1:48:21.940
 and the consistent effect seems to be an increase

1:48:21.940 --> 1:48:23.060
 in luteinizing hormone.

1:48:23.060 --> 1:48:26.680
 There's a noticeable effect on testicular size and volume.

1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:27.740
 So a lot of people will take this and be like,

1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:29.740
 oh, you know, their balls are getting bigger,

1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:30.780
 and so they get all excited

1:48:30.780 --> 1:48:32.700
 that something good is happening.

1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:35.500
 But we don't know the long-term safety and efficacy

1:48:35.500 --> 1:48:36.660
 of something like Fidogia,

1:48:36.660 --> 1:48:37.780
 whether or not it needs to be cycled.

1:48:37.780 --> 1:48:40.060
 Yeah, this is why I'm also very leery

1:48:40.060 --> 1:48:41.580
 of the supplements in this space,

1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:46.060
 because at least when we're using HCG or testosterone,

1:48:46.060 --> 1:48:48.560
 like we have so many years of data.

1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:51.020
 You have to remember how many women are using this stuff

1:48:51.020 --> 1:48:53.060
 for reproductive medicine.

1:48:53.060 --> 1:48:57.240
 So, you know, I think the FDA has a lot of faults.

1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:00.480
 I think I have an entire podcast devoted

1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:02.300
 to the corruption of the FDA

1:49:02.300 --> 1:49:03.900
 and all of the mistakes that have been made

1:49:03.900 --> 1:49:07.740
 with respect to their oversight in especially generic drugs,

1:49:08.620 --> 1:49:11.660
 but it's way more regulated than the wild, wild west

1:49:11.660 --> 1:49:13.280
 of nutty supplement land.

1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:14.120
 Absolutely.

1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:16.260
 I think that the reason for talking about things

1:49:16.260 --> 1:49:17.720
 like Tonga and Fidogia was

1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:19.980
 to provide some intermediate discussion

1:49:19.980 --> 1:49:22.160
 between doing all the correct things,

1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:24.260
 but no supplementation or hormone therapy,

1:49:24.260 --> 1:49:25.900
 and then going straight to hormone therapy.

1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:27.440
 It's sort of like the leap from,

1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:30.360
 I can't focus very well to Ritalin, right,

1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:33.320
 without a real diagnosis of ADHD,

1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:36.300
 to, oh, well, maybe some things like alpha-GPC

1:49:36.300 --> 1:49:38.020
 low doses of nicotine, right?

1:49:38.020 --> 1:49:39.740
 But I agree entirely.

1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:41.440
 I mean, the sourcing is important.

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:45.680
 The dosages are worked out empirically on an individual basis

1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:47.820
 and there aren't randomized control trials.

1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:49.260
 There just aren't.

1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:54.260
 Yeah, and, you know, have kind of like a seven,

1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:56.360
 this is another Peter principle, right?

1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:58.540
 So I've got a lot of patients that come into the practice

1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:01.160
 and, you know, during our intake, we go through,

1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:03.360
 what drugs and supplements are you taking right now?

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:04.520
 And, you know, a lot of people come in,

1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:05.680
 I'm not taking anything, Peter.

1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:07.320
 I just, you're in charge now.

1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:08.800
 Like, tell me what you think.

1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:09.960
 And then you get a lot of people that come in

1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:12.640
 and they're like, we're gonna need an extra few pages

1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:13.480
 for this part of the documentation.

1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:15.120
 Right, the people who travel with a suitcase

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:16.720
 that you can hear as they walk through the airport

1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:17.560
 from all the pills that I like.

1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:19.400
 Right, and so I give these patients

1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:20.520
 a little homework exercise,

1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:22.680
 which is you have to answer these seven questions

1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:23.940
 for every supplement you take.

1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:26.100
 And here's the spreadsheet and let's talk about it.

1:50:26.100 --> 1:50:28.160
 And it basically just runs through,

1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:31.280
 like, you know, it's basically walking you through

1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:34.360
 the logic of why do you take this molecule?

1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:38.000
 And I think for many people,

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.360
 when they do that, it's very sobering, right?

1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:42.220
 They kind of, a lot of them will come back and be like,

1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:45.800
 you know what, I don't think I can come up with any reason

1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:47.940
 along this really rigorous line of thinking

1:50:47.940 --> 1:50:50.440
 as to why I'm taking 80% of this stuff.

1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:51.900
 Well, I know people, and actually we know some

1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:55.060
 of the same people were fanatic about like red light

1:50:55.060 --> 1:50:58.120
 on the testes, sunning their testes,

1:50:58.120 --> 1:50:59.680
 putting ice packs on their testes.

1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:00.960
 It's kind of all over the place.

1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:03.480
 The number of things that people are trying and doing

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:05.800
 in order to increase testosterone output

1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:07.360
 from their testes is pretty remarkable.

1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:10.280
 And that said, among some of the women I know,

1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:11.320
 the number of things that they're doing

1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:13.600
 to try and promote longevity and fertility,

1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:16.100
 and in particular skin health, hair health,

1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:19.640
 and nail health is also kind of outrageous.

1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:21.800
 Everything from collagen to red light therapies,

1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:24.000
 which may actually have some efficacy in certain cases.

1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.960
 But there's a hunger there, right?

1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:27.880
 Oh, for sure.

1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:29.800
 One of the things that I hope gets a lot more attention

1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:33.200
 is the use of rapamycin for preserving ovarian health.

1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:36.640
 So the animal literature on this is pretty impressive, right?

1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:41.640
 So in mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life.

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:43.240
 And so it makes sense, right?

1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:44.320
 I mean, it totally makes sense

1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:48.820
 why the most potent, zero protective molecule we have

1:51:48.820 --> 1:51:52.720
 would also preserve and extend ovarian life, at least in mice.

1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:57.640
 So I'd love to see the clinical trials done in women

1:51:57.640 --> 1:51:59.240
 to test this hypothesis.

1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:00.480
 I definitely want to come back to this

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:01.600
 because it's a key thing.

1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:02.680
 I know that a lot of people are interested

1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:05.200
 in female fertility out there,

1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:06.280
 including their male partners.

1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:09.960
 So going back to, so now I understand

1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:11.160
 why you don't prescribe clomiphene

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:16.160
 because of this potential dysmosterol link.

1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:19.020
 What about testosterone therapy?

1:52:19.020 --> 1:52:22.100
 So less frequent, lower doses,

1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:25.960
 less or no estrogen inhibition or aromatase inhibition?

1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:29.520
 Yeah, we're only using an aromatase blocker,

1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:31.480
 and we use Arimidex when we do.

1:52:31.480 --> 1:52:34.480
 It's just to get that estradiol into the range we want.

1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:36.720
 I like to see it between 30 and 50.

1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:37.840
 That's the sweet spot.

1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:41.320
 And I don't know, I would say like a third,

1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:45.460
 maybe not even a third, I'd say probably 20% of men

1:52:45.460 --> 1:52:49.740
 require a microdose of anastrozole to get into that range.

1:52:49.740 --> 1:52:50.580
 Most do not.

1:52:50.580 --> 1:52:53.060
 And I'd rather err on the side

1:52:53.060 --> 1:52:54.900
 of being a little high than a little low.

1:52:54.900 --> 1:52:57.840
 So I never really want to be below 25.

1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:00.940
 If, unless, sometimes it's just below 25 and it is,

1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:02.420
 it is what it is, that's fine.

1:53:02.420 --> 1:53:04.420
 But if we're suppressing it to below 25,

1:53:04.420 --> 1:53:06.820
 I never want to be in that zone.

1:53:06.820 --> 1:53:09.520
 And then yes, so TRT is ultimately,

1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:12.620
 giving testosterone, cipunate is usually what we use.

1:53:12.620 --> 1:53:15.020
 Injectable, so as opposed to cream or pellet.

1:53:15.020 --> 1:53:16.480
 Correct.

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:21.480
 I used to use pellets with women for some

1:53:22.060 --> 1:53:26.680
 who were really adamant about the convenience of it.

1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:29.100
 But for a bunch of reasons, I just,

1:53:29.100 --> 1:53:31.220
 I'm mostly not doing that.

1:53:31.220 --> 1:53:33.600
 And I've never been a fan of pellets in men.

1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:36.820
 You can't control the dosage once it's in, right?

1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:37.640
 Well, even if you know the dose,

1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:38.740
 yeah, that's obviously a problem.

1:53:38.740 --> 1:53:40.660
 But I don't think, there's a big difference

1:53:40.660 --> 1:53:42.080
 between putting a pellet into a man and a woman.

1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:44.180
 So when you're putting an estrogen pellet into a woman,

1:53:44.180 --> 1:53:47.380
 it's like, it's that big.

1:53:47.380 --> 1:53:49.780
 When you're putting enough pellets into a man

1:53:49.780 --> 1:53:51.500
 for six months of testosterone,

1:53:51.500 --> 1:53:54.740
 it's two sums of pellets that are longer than my finger.

1:53:54.740 --> 1:53:56.660
 So you're putting like a V-shape,

1:53:56.660 --> 1:53:58.900
 you're putting it into the gluteal fat.

1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:01.620
 So it's just a more morbid procedure

1:54:01.620 --> 1:54:02.800
 and I don't think it's necessary.

1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:05.100
 I think if you know how to manage it,

1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:07.660
 through sort of the injections and now,

1:54:07.660 --> 1:54:09.540
 yeah, well, especially now if you're doing,

1:54:09.540 --> 1:54:11.580
 we're having them do sub-Q injections anyway.

1:54:11.580 --> 1:54:14.740
 So it's not IM, they're using a five eighths inch

1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:16.780
 to a one inch 25 gauge needle,

1:54:16.780 --> 1:54:17.700
 which is about the smallest needle

1:54:17.700 --> 1:54:21.380
 you can push the oil through once to twice a week,

1:54:21.380 --> 1:54:22.380
 depending on, and by the way,

1:54:22.380 --> 1:54:23.460
 if they're real needle phobes,

1:54:23.460 --> 1:54:26.260
 we use Zyosted, which is a preloaded pen.

1:54:26.260 --> 1:54:29.780
 And are you having all men take HCG

1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:31.220
 to maintain fertility and test their killer size?

1:54:31.220 --> 1:54:32.260
 Only if they want to.

1:54:32.260 --> 1:54:33.100
 Got it.

1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:33.920
 Yeah.

1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:36.220
 And by the way, we do not like to use TRT in men who,

1:54:36.220 --> 1:54:37.840
 we don't like to use testosterone specifically

1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:39.880
 in men who still want to maintain fertility.

1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:41.020
 We just steer them away from that.

1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.540
 Because total sperm count goes down.

1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:43.460
 Yeah, we just say, why risk it?

1:54:43.460 --> 1:54:45.060
 Like we'd rather use HCG.

1:54:45.900 --> 1:54:46.720
 Just on its own.

1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:48.540
 Yeah, just wait, just wait until you're done reproducing.

1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:50.560
 Bank sperm, wait till you're done reproducing

1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:52.060
 before we go to testosterone.

1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.900
 What are some of the benefits

1:54:54.900 --> 1:54:57.660
 and what are some of the cautionary notes

1:54:57.660 --> 1:55:01.780
 with appropriate TRT, meaning of the kind of contour

1:55:01.780 --> 1:55:03.260
 that we're talking about here,

1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:08.180
 a lower dose with the yes or no low estrogen control?

1:55:08.180 --> 1:55:13.180
 People, what generally people report, how do they feel?

1:55:13.180 --> 1:55:14.460
 What does it allow them to do

1:55:14.460 --> 1:55:16.700
 that they couldn't do or feel before?

1:55:16.700 --> 1:55:19.840
 And then in terms of what are the markers to look for?

1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:24.020
 Is it LDL, blood pressure, water retention, acne,

1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:24.840
 those kinds of things?

1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:25.680
 Are there some other things as well?

1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:26.660
 Yeah, it depends on the doses, right?

1:55:26.660 --> 1:55:29.060
 I mean, again, we're using these in really low doses.

1:55:29.060 --> 1:55:31.140
 So it's pretty rare that we'd have a patient

1:55:31.140 --> 1:55:34.340
 on more than 100 milligrams a week of testosterone.

1:55:35.620 --> 1:55:36.940
 I think for comparison,

1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:40.300
 like a bodybuilder could easily take 500 to 1,000

1:55:40.300 --> 1:55:41.900
 during a high growth phase.

1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:43.980
 I know some of these guys, they go ballistic

1:55:43.980 --> 1:55:47.420
 or they're doing moderate levels of testosterone sibonate,

1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.700
 but they're also taking dianabolic, sandralone,

1:55:52.780 --> 1:55:54.500
 SARMs and a bunch of other things.

1:55:54.500 --> 1:55:56.180
 I mean, their stacks are kind of ridiculous.

1:55:56.180 --> 1:55:58.340
 I mean, no disrespect to that sport,

1:55:58.340 --> 1:56:00.940
 but I mean, people are dying like crazy

1:56:00.940 --> 1:56:01.760
 in that sport right now.

1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:02.780
 It's outside of physiology.

1:56:02.780 --> 1:56:04.840
 Yeah, and I think for 99% of people listening,

1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:06.660
 they just, they look, they hear bodybuilder

1:56:06.660 --> 1:56:09.620
 and they just go like, why would somebody do that anyway?

1:56:09.620 --> 1:56:10.940
 I think that's the typical response.

1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:12.860
 So the point is a lot of,

1:56:12.860 --> 1:56:15.420
 but we owe those guys a great deal of gratitude

1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:17.100
 because they've shown us the boundaries.

1:56:17.100 --> 1:56:18.140
 Including the women.

1:56:18.140 --> 1:56:19.780
 That's right, yeah.

1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:23.740
 And so those bodybuilders have taught us a lot

1:56:23.740 --> 1:56:26.120
 about like what happens.

1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:30.900
 And so, yeah, the bloating, the water retention,

1:56:30.900 --> 1:56:34.020
 acne, hair loss, hair growth, all of those things,

1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:36.020
 we understand the truth of it is

1:56:36.020 --> 1:56:39.100
 we just don't see those things in our patients.

1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:41.900
 But 100 milligrams per week is a very low output.

1:56:41.900 --> 1:56:42.740
 My understanding is-

1:56:42.740 --> 1:56:43.560
 But it's a physiologic dose.

1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:44.940
 I mean, the reality of it is it's enough for most people.

1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:47.060
 I mean, there's probably the highest we've ever had to go

1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:49.500
 is maybe 70 twice a week.

1:56:49.500 --> 1:56:52.780
 What's the youngest patient you've ever had to put on TRT?

1:56:52.780 --> 1:56:53.940
 Actual testosterone?

1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:54.780
 Mm-hmm.

1:56:58.180 --> 1:56:59.020
 Probably, that's a good question.

1:56:59.020 --> 1:57:01.140
 I'm thinking about maybe 40.

1:57:02.140 --> 1:57:03.300
 I think that's great for people to hear

1:57:03.300 --> 1:57:04.960
 because I know that a lot of guys in their 20s

1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:07.180
 are thinking TRT is the way to go, and I would argue,

1:57:07.180 --> 1:57:08.580
 unless you're doing everything else right

1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:11.060
 and you're still hypogonadal and you're really struggling,

1:57:11.060 --> 1:57:14.020
 put that time off because also the fertility issue,

1:57:14.020 --> 1:57:14.940
 you want to delay delay delay.

1:57:14.940 --> 1:57:17.100
 Well, again, it depends if when we say TRT,

1:57:17.100 --> 1:57:19.700
 if you're in your 20s and there's no other way,

1:57:19.700 --> 1:57:22.560
 I would hope you would be steered toward HCG

1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:24.340
 to at least preserve testicular function.

1:57:24.340 --> 1:57:26.260
 Now, again, we don't actually know

1:57:26.260 --> 1:57:29.820
 if after being on HCG for 10 years,

1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:31.500
 your pituitary will still work.

1:57:31.500 --> 1:57:33.220
 Right, you won't be able to make your own luteinizing.

1:57:33.220 --> 1:57:35.260
 Exactly, so it might be the case

1:57:35.260 --> 1:57:37.660
 that you're gonna need something upstream of that,

1:57:37.660 --> 1:57:39.620
 like Clomid to kickstart it.

1:57:39.620 --> 1:57:42.500
 But again, I don't want anybody who's listening to this

1:57:42.500 --> 1:57:44.340
 who's using Clomid for fertility

1:57:44.340 --> 1:57:46.220
 to think that there's anything wrong with it.

1:57:46.220 --> 1:57:47.940
 My concern over this became like,

1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:50.660
 if you're gonna be on this for 10 years, is it problematic?

1:57:50.660 --> 1:57:52.860
 Not if you're using this for a course of IVF

1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:54.340
 or something like that.

1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:57.400
 So again, if we felt that someone's pituitary

1:57:57.400 --> 1:57:59.820
 was not working, I would be happy to put three months

1:57:59.820 --> 1:58:01.480
 of Clomid on them to kind of try to see

1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:02.860
 if we could blast it back.

1:58:02.860 --> 1:58:05.660
 Do you have men cycle on and off testosterone

1:58:05.660 --> 1:58:06.660
 at these low dosages?

1:58:06.660 --> 1:58:08.740
 Are they taking a month vacation from it every once in a while?

1:58:08.740 --> 1:58:09.580
 Yeah, it totally depends.

1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:10.880
 You know, I was talking to a patient yesterday

1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:13.680
 where we just decided to change the cycle.

1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:15.700
 Eight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG.

1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:17.380
 Eight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG.

1:58:17.380 --> 1:58:18.500
 So that's gonna be a cycle

1:58:18.500 --> 1:58:20.540
 that maintains his testosterone level

1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:22.840
 but fluctuates between endogenous, exogenous,

1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:23.980
 endogenous, exogenous.

1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:27.620
 Sometimes we'll just do testosterone on, off, on, off.

1:58:27.620 --> 1:58:30.720
 And there it's like, how much can he replenish naturally

1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:34.340
 but understanding his T will dip during those off cycles.

1:58:34.340 --> 1:58:37.220
 It seems to me there's a tremendous incentive

1:58:37.220 --> 1:58:40.780
 for somebody to develop a molecule

1:58:40.780 --> 1:58:43.440
 that can directly target SHBG,

1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:46.380
 besides oxyandryl and ANIMAR, right?

1:58:46.380 --> 1:58:49.960
 If one could just drop SHBG just the tiniest bit,

1:58:49.960 --> 1:58:52.020
 it seems like one could adjust the free T

1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:54.700
 in a way that would be great.

1:58:54.700 --> 1:58:56.620
 I don't know why that molecule is so hard to target

1:58:56.620 --> 1:58:57.700
 but somebody ought to do it.

1:58:57.700 --> 1:58:59.140
 The chemistry can't be that hard.

1:58:59.140 --> 1:59:01.140
 I talked with Patrick Arnold about this

1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:02.840
 many, many years ago.

1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:06.860
 I wish I could remember what his ID,

1:59:06.860 --> 1:59:09.580
 he had a comment about this that at the time made sense

1:59:09.580 --> 1:59:10.580
 and I don't remember what it was.

1:59:10.580 --> 1:59:13.180
 Cause I had that thought too, like, man,

1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:15.840
 especially for that subset of guys

1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:17.620
 who have normal testosterone

1:59:17.620 --> 1:59:19.660
 but they're just overbinding it.

1:59:19.660 --> 1:59:21.380
 I'm really glad that you brought up this issue

1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:23.100
 of total testosterone versus free T.

1:59:23.100 --> 1:59:25.540
 And the reason is ever since going on podcasts

1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:26.580
 and talking about this stuff

1:59:26.580 --> 1:59:28.580
 and talking about it on this podcast,

1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:30.060
 people will send me their numbers,

1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:31.380
 they'll send me their charts

1:59:31.380 --> 1:59:33.020
 and then they'll send photos of themselves.

1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:34.860
 And I can tell you, while I'm not a clinician

1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:37.220
 and I haven't done fancy statistics on it,

1:59:37.220 --> 1:59:38.620
 there's very little correlation

1:59:38.620 --> 1:59:41.980
 between someone's absolute testosterone and how they appear.

1:59:41.980 --> 1:59:46.060
 I mean, some of these guys look really lean, really strong

1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:50.620
 and they'll say, oh, total testosterone is 550, 480, right?

1:59:50.620 --> 1:59:53.900
 And then other people, you know, testosterone is 860

1:59:53.900 --> 1:59:55.540
 but you look at them and you think,

1:59:55.540 --> 1:59:57.780
 oh, they kind of have a kind of a doughy look to them.

1:59:57.780 --> 2:00:00.300
 And so it's gotta be this free testosterone thing

2:00:00.300 --> 2:00:01.540
 plus estrogen, et cetera.

2:00:01.540 --> 2:00:02.380
 And so cosmetically-

2:00:02.380 --> 2:00:04.060
 Well, but also training and nutrition too, right?

2:00:04.060 --> 2:00:08.220
 I mean, I just think, I think for all this talk

2:00:08.220 --> 2:00:10.380
 about testosterone, which I enjoy talking about

2:00:10.380 --> 2:00:12.220
 and I enjoy talking about the data

2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:15.020
 on long-term health consequences of testosterone

2:00:15.020 --> 2:00:17.460
 because this is another controversial topic.

2:00:17.460 --> 2:00:19.980
 I also think people kind of overstate its importance.

2:00:19.980 --> 2:00:20.820
 I agree.

2:00:20.820 --> 2:00:23.540
 And I think there's a group of people who think

2:00:23.540 --> 2:00:24.900
 if I could just fix my testosterone,

2:00:24.900 --> 2:00:25.840
 everything will be better.

2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:29.620
 And it's sort of like, no, actually that's not true at all.

2:00:29.620 --> 2:00:32.580
 Really, the only purpose in my mind of fixing testosterone

2:00:32.580 --> 2:00:36.220
 is to give you the capacity to work harder.

2:00:36.220 --> 2:00:38.600
 It's really going to help you recover more

2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:39.540
 from your workouts.

2:00:39.540 --> 2:00:41.940
 This should just give you a greater ability

2:00:41.940 --> 2:00:44.980
 to experience muscle protein synthesis.

2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:47.300
 So, you know, if I just give you a bunch of testosterone

2:00:47.300 --> 2:00:49.460
 and you sit on the couch and your nutrition doesn't change

2:00:49.460 --> 2:00:50.540
 and you're not exercising anymore,

2:00:50.540 --> 2:00:53.540
 you're not gonna experience any benefits of this thing.

2:00:53.540 --> 2:00:55.860
 I mean, my testosterone level has fluctuated quite a bit

2:00:55.860 --> 2:00:57.060
 throughout my life.

2:00:57.060 --> 2:00:59.460
 And when I think about as an adult,

2:00:59.460 --> 2:01:01.420
 not sort of including when I was sort of

2:01:01.420 --> 2:01:03.980
 a fanatical teenager, but as an adult,

2:01:03.980 --> 2:01:08.100
 when was I at my absolute most insane physique?

2:01:08.100 --> 2:01:11.300
 Like my best performance on a DEXA scan

2:01:11.300 --> 2:01:16.060
 would have been 30, I was 38 years old.

2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:18.260
 By DEXA, I was 7% body fat.

2:01:18.260 --> 2:01:21.460
 My fat-free mass index was like 23.2,

2:01:21.460 --> 2:01:24.780
 23.3 kilograms per meter squared.

2:01:24.780 --> 2:01:29.780
 I mean, I was huge, strong, and totally ripped.

2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.160
 My testosterone was in the toilet.

2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:34.740
 I was over-training like crazy.

2:01:34.740 --> 2:01:38.860
 I was exercising probably 26 hours a week,

2:01:38.860 --> 2:01:41.420
 killing it in the gym, swimming like a banshee,

2:01:41.420 --> 2:01:43.660
 cycling like my life depended on it,

2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:47.580
 grossly over-trained, low T, but, you know,

2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:51.300
 I mean, physically looked like twice the guy I am today.

2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:52.460
 You know, today my T is probably

2:01:52.460 --> 2:01:54.340
 twice as high as it was then.

2:01:54.340 --> 2:01:57.140
 So, you know, now you could say, well, Peter,

2:01:57.140 --> 2:01:58.700
 what if you took T back then?

2:01:58.700 --> 2:01:59.820
 How much better could you have been?

2:01:59.820 --> 2:02:01.100
 Sure.

2:02:01.100 --> 2:02:03.820
 But again, I think the take home is

2:02:03.820 --> 2:02:06.740
 just giving somebody T doesn't do much of anything.

2:02:06.740 --> 2:02:08.980
 It probably helps on the insulin resistance front

2:02:08.980 --> 2:02:12.420
 without any other thing, but to me, that's a waste.

2:02:12.420 --> 2:02:15.300
 Like that's squandering the gift that it is giving you,

2:02:15.300 --> 2:02:17.920
 which is the ability to do more work

2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:21.540
 and, you know, capture the benefit of it via muscle protein

2:02:21.540 --> 2:02:22.380
 synthesis.

2:02:22.380 --> 2:02:24.900
 I agree, and I think that the psychological effect

2:02:24.900 --> 2:02:27.860
 of testosterone, whether or not it's exogenous or endogenous

2:02:27.860 --> 2:02:30.640
 is it makes effort feel good.

2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:31.480
 Yeah.

2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:32.800
 At some level, it really seems to do that.

2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:34.940
 And Sapolsky tells me the main reason,

2:02:34.940 --> 2:02:37.540
 or mechanistically the main reason that it can do that

2:02:37.540 --> 2:02:41.100
 is by adjusting levels of activity in the amygdala.

2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:41.940
 Interesting.

2:02:41.940 --> 2:02:44.020
 And so there's some interesting imaging there.

2:02:44.020 --> 2:02:47.500
 I'd love to chat more about the cholesterol pathway.

2:02:47.500 --> 2:02:49.480
 And I know this is a huge landscape as well,

2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:53.000
 but I think we're doing a good job of diving in deep,

2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:56.980
 but not getting stuck in the underlying currents at all.

2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:02.060
 There's tremendous debate about whether or not

2:03:02.060 --> 2:03:05.380
 dietary cholesterol directly relates to,

2:03:05.380 --> 2:03:09.860
 or does not relate to serum cholesterol, LDL and HDL.

2:03:09.860 --> 2:03:10.700
 Here's my-

2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:11.780
 Is there?

2:03:11.780 --> 2:03:13.340
 Well, let me put it this way.

2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:17.220
 There are people that argue, I'm certainly not arguing.

2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:22.220
 There are people that argue that if one eats a ton

2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:27.580
 of saturated fat, that LDL goes up and HDL goes down.

2:03:27.580 --> 2:03:29.660
 Okay, but that's not dietary cholesterol per se.

2:03:29.660 --> 2:03:31.180
 No, not dietary cholesterol per se.

2:03:31.180 --> 2:03:33.140
 But, and then there are people that argue

2:03:33.140 --> 2:03:37.820
 that any increase in saturated fat intake

2:03:37.820 --> 2:03:40.140
 is going to be bad, that you already synthesize

2:03:40.140 --> 2:03:42.620
 enough cholesterol for hormone production, et cetera.

2:03:42.620 --> 2:03:43.900
 I'd like to talk about this in terms

2:03:43.900 --> 2:03:45.860
 of how one should read their charts.

2:03:45.860 --> 2:03:49.720
 My LDL is in what I'm told is healthy range.

2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:52.340
 My HDL is in what I'm told is healthy range.

2:03:52.340 --> 2:03:55.720
 I do try and not overeat things like butter, cheese,

2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:58.040
 and red meat, but I do eat some of those things

2:03:58.040 --> 2:03:59.440
 and I feel pretty good.

2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:04.440
 But most people are operating under the assumption

2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.440
 that eating saturated fat is bad

2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:10.940
 and you only do it in so far as you want to taste it.

2:04:10.940 --> 2:04:13.120
 And then of course, there's a small group of people

2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:16.760
 that love to eat organs and meats and really pack

2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:19.960
 cholesterol and would argue that it doesn't matter

2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:24.440
 if your LDL is 870, it's not going to impact your health.

2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:29.080
 What's the reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol,

2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:31.800
 saturated fat, at least in your view?

2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:35.720
 So first, let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat,

2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:38.920
 just for the listener, because we use them,

2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:40.080
 I don't want to make sure people understand.

2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.620
 So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule.

2:04:43.620 --> 2:04:45.620
 So it's a ringed molecule.

2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:49.200
 I used to know exactly what its structure was,

2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:53.040
 but it could have 36 carbons for all I remember.

2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:56.720
 It is a lipid, so it is a hydrophobic molecule

2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:01.000
 that is synthesized by every cell in the human body.

2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:04.040
 It is so important that without it,

2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:07.720
 if you look at sort of genetic conditions

2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:10.560
 that impair cholesterol synthesis,

2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:14.260
 depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero.

2:05:14.260 --> 2:05:16.760
 So in other words, anything that really interferes

2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:19.360
 with our ability to produce cholesterol

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:23.000
 is a threat to us as a species.

2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:26.400
 And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up

2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:29.440
 the cell membrane of every cell in our body.

2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:32.980
 So as you know, but maybe the listeners don't,

2:05:32.980 --> 2:05:35.200
 even though a cell is a spherical thing,

2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:36.920
 it has to be fluid, right?

2:05:36.920 --> 2:05:39.800
 It's not just a rigid like sphere,

2:05:39.800 --> 2:05:41.360
 like a blow up ball, right?

2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:44.960
 It's gotta be able to kind of move in this way

2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:47.440
 to mesh with other cells.

2:05:47.440 --> 2:05:50.680
 It also has to accommodate having porous structures

2:05:50.680 --> 2:05:54.400
 that traverse its membrane to allow ions

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:56.740
 and things like that to go across.

2:05:56.740 --> 2:05:59.440
 And it's cholesterol that gives the fluidity

2:05:59.440 --> 2:06:01.180
 to that membrane.

2:06:01.180 --> 2:06:04.040
 It's also, as you're alluding to, the backbone

2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:07.120
 of some of the most important hormones in our body,

2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:11.460
 estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol.

2:06:12.500 --> 2:06:14.560
 So we have this thing, super important.

2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:17.960
 Okay, then let's talk about does cholesterol,

2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:20.220
 can you get cholesterol in your diet?

2:06:20.220 --> 2:06:23.380
 Yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol.

2:06:24.820 --> 2:06:28.480
 What was known in 1960,

2:06:28.480 --> 2:06:31.840
 but somehow escaped everybody's imagination

2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:34.320
 until finally the American Heart Association acknowledged

2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:37.960
 this a few years ago, is that the cholesterol you eat

2:06:37.960 --> 2:06:40.240
 does not really make it into your body.

2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:42.680
 And the reason for that is it's hysterified.

2:06:42.680 --> 2:06:45.040
 So we have, and not to get too nerdy,

2:06:45.040 --> 2:06:47.440
 but I think people, I really think it's important

2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:48.680
 people understand how this thing works.

2:06:48.680 --> 2:06:51.800
 So we have cells in our gut, enterocytes,

2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:54.400
 they're the endothelial cells of our gut.

2:06:54.400 --> 2:06:57.520
 They have, each one of them has basically

2:06:57.520 --> 2:06:58.700
 two transporters on them.

2:06:58.700 --> 2:07:03.040
 So the first is called the Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter.

2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:07.020
 The second is called the ATP-Binding cassette G5-G8.

2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:11.440
 Okay, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter

2:07:11.440 --> 2:07:14.820
 will bring in any sterile, cholesterol,

2:07:14.820 --> 2:07:17.520
 zosterol, phytosterol, any sterile

2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:19.520
 that fits through the door will come in.

2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:25.240
 Virtually all of that is the cholesterol we produce

2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:27.480
 that gets taken back to the liver,

2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:30.960
 that the liver packages in bile and secretes.

2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:32.800
 So that's what aids in our digestion,

2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:34.400
 which is another thing I should have mentioned earlier.

2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:36.800
 In addition to using cholesterol

2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:38.760
 for cell membranes and hormones,

2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:41.200
 we wouldn't be able to digest our food without cholesterol

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:44.080
 because it's what makes up the bile salts.

2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:47.200
 So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated

2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:48.880
 in a pool throughout our body,

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:51.580
 and this is the way it gets back into the body.

2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:54.720
 It's through this Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter.

2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:56.640
 When it gets in there, the body,

2:07:56.640 --> 2:07:58.560
 this is the checkpoint of regulation.

2:07:58.560 --> 2:07:59.540
 This is where the body says,

2:07:59.540 --> 2:08:02.340
 do you have enough cholesterol in the body, yes or no?

2:08:02.340 --> 2:08:05.160
 If yes, I will let that cholesterol

2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:07.360
 make its way into the circulation.

2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:10.060
 So it'll go off the basolateral side of the cell,

2:08:10.060 --> 2:08:12.080
 not the luminal side, into the body.

2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:13.680
 Alternatively, the body says,

2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:16.080
 you know what, we have enough cholesterol.

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:17.440
 I'm gonna let you poop this out.

2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:20.040
 And now the ATP binding cassette will shoot it out.

2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:22.740
 It'll go back into the luminal side, and away it goes.

2:08:22.740 --> 2:08:27.740
 So all of the cholesterol in our body is not esterified,

2:08:27.900 --> 2:08:29.140
 and it doesn't have that big,

2:08:29.140 --> 2:08:31.840
 bulky side chain attached to it.

2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:34.460
 The cholesterol you eat is esterified,

2:08:34.460 --> 2:08:37.180
 and an esterified cholesterol molecule

2:08:37.180 --> 2:08:38.940
 simply can't physically pass

2:08:38.940 --> 2:08:41.220
 through that Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter.

2:08:41.220 --> 2:08:46.220
 Now, we probably manage to de-esterify

2:08:46.740 --> 2:08:50.260
 10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol.

2:08:50.260 --> 2:08:52.340
 So in other words, there are small amounts

2:08:52.340 --> 2:08:53.500
 of dietary cholesterol

2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:57.140
 that do make their way into our circulation,

2:08:57.140 --> 2:08:59.780
 but it represents a small fraction

2:08:59.780 --> 2:09:02.160
 of our total body's pool of cholesterol.

2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:05.420
 Again, this was known even by Ancel Keys,

2:09:05.420 --> 2:09:09.580
 the guy who turned fat into the biggest bogeyman of all time.

2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:12.760
 Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.

2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:16.040
 Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol.

2:09:17.340 --> 2:09:19.100
 Again, it took the American Heart Association

2:09:19.100 --> 2:09:21.380
 another 60 years to figure that out,

2:09:21.380 --> 2:09:23.540
 but even now, they acknowledge that.

2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.500
 Dietary cholesterol has no bearing.

2:09:25.500 --> 2:09:29.980
 So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies,

2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:32.940
 or at least people who are highly credentialed

2:09:32.940 --> 2:09:34.020
 from good institutions,

2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:37.260
 claiming that eating saturated fat, cheese-

2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:38.380
 Saturated fat's different.

2:09:38.380 --> 2:09:39.620
 Saturated fat and red meat,

2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:42.040
 things that are rich in cholesterol,

2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:45.940
 to be more specific, is bad for us

2:09:45.940 --> 2:09:47.940
 in terms of our eventual LDL.

2:09:47.940 --> 2:09:49.140
 So this is two different things.

2:09:49.140 --> 2:09:52.660
 So saturated fat consumption in many people

2:09:52.660 --> 2:09:54.880
 will raise LDL cholesterol.

2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:56.940
 So it's important to differentiate

2:09:56.940 --> 2:09:58.900
 between what is saturated fat.

2:09:58.900 --> 2:10:00.860
 So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid,

2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:01.940
 just so people understand.

2:10:01.940 --> 2:10:03.580
 Totally different molecule from cholesterol.

2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:05.980
 Cholesterol is this very complicated ring structure,

2:10:05.980 --> 2:10:08.100
 multiple rings stuck together.

2:10:08.100 --> 2:10:11.320
 SFA, saturated fat, is just a long-chain fatty acid

2:10:11.320 --> 2:10:14.160
 that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds,

2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:16.100
 and it can exist in isolation.

2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:19.540
 It can exist in a triglyceride, triacylglyceride,

2:10:19.540 --> 2:10:23.180
 or a phospholipid, or all sorts of things like that.

2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:27.780
 So when we eat foods that contain fat,

2:10:27.780 --> 2:10:30.380
 basically there are three distinctions for that fat.

2:10:30.380 --> 2:10:31.460
 Is it saturated?

2:10:31.460 --> 2:10:33.260
 Is it monounsaturated, one double bond?

2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:35.820
 Or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds?

2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:40.680
 The observation that eating saturated fat

2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:43.980
 raises cholesterol is generally correct.

2:10:43.980 --> 2:10:47.660
 But again, because if we're gonna start talking about LDL,

2:10:47.660 --> 2:10:49.120
 we have to explain what LDL is.

2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:50.140
 This is another one of those things

2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:52.400
 that's just so grossly misunderstood

2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:57.400
 that it makes having discussions about this very complicated.

2:10:58.620 --> 2:11:00.340
 Let's go back to the cholesterol problem.

2:11:00.340 --> 2:11:04.420
 So every cell in our body makes cholesterol.

2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:08.460
 And almost without exception, they make enough.

2:11:08.460 --> 2:11:11.300
 There are a handful of times, however,

2:11:11.300 --> 2:11:14.940
 when a cell needs to borrow cholesterol from another cell.

2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:17.960
 Okay, so how would you do this, right?

2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:20.840
 So if you're playing God for a minute

2:11:20.840 --> 2:11:22.700
 and you wanna design a system,

2:11:22.700 --> 2:11:24.920
 you have to be able to transport cholesterol

2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:26.940
 from one cell to another.

2:11:26.940 --> 2:11:30.080
 The most logical place you would transport this

2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:31.500
 is through the circulation.

2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:35.140
 And the problem with circulation is it's water.

2:11:35.140 --> 2:11:36.820
 Plasma is water.

2:11:36.820 --> 2:11:38.140
 So now you have this problem,

2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:40.700
 which is I want to transport cargo

2:11:40.700 --> 2:11:45.140
 that is hydrophobic in a hydrophilic medium.

2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:46.740
 Can't do it.

2:11:46.740 --> 2:11:48.300
 So if you think about all the things

2:11:48.300 --> 2:11:50.380
 that we transport in our blood,

2:11:50.380 --> 2:11:55.100
 sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that,

2:11:55.100 --> 2:11:56.500
 they're water soluble.

2:11:56.500 --> 2:11:57.320
 It's easy.

2:11:57.320 --> 2:11:59.820
 They just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone.

2:11:59.820 --> 2:12:01.940
 But when you wanna move cholesterol,

2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:04.940
 you have to package it in something that's hydrophilic.

2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:07.900
 That something is called a lipoprotein.

2:12:07.900 --> 2:12:10.460
 So we have these spherical molecules

2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:11.940
 that are lipid on the inside,

2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:14.760
 protein on the outside, lipoprotein.

2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:18.200
 And inside, they contain cholesterol and triglycerides.

2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:20.560
 So now you've got the spherical thing,

2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:23.140
 triglyceride, cholesterol on the inside,

2:12:23.140 --> 2:12:26.540
 and it's chaperoned by a hydrophilic molecule

2:12:26.540 --> 2:12:30.340
 that allows it to move through our circulation.

2:12:30.340 --> 2:12:34.320
 And those lipoproteins exist in different densities.

2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:37.660
 So if you run these out on a gel electrophoresis plate,

2:12:37.660 --> 2:12:39.140
 you'll identify different densities.

2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:40.980
 The density is a function of how much protein

2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:42.740
 and how much lipid is in it.

2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:44.540
 So the highest density of this

2:12:44.540 --> 2:12:47.020
 is called a high density lipoprotein.

2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:48.700
 And the lowest density of this

2:12:48.700 --> 2:12:52.620
 is called a very low density lipoprotein, a VLDL.

2:12:52.620 --> 2:12:54.740
 And then next to that, you have an LDL,

2:12:54.740 --> 2:12:56.200
 a low density lipoprotein.

2:12:56.200 --> 2:12:57.820
 And then next to that, you have an IDL,

2:12:57.820 --> 2:12:59.940
 an intermediate density lipoprotein.

2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:06.260
 So, you know, it actually goes VLDL, IDL, LDL.

2:13:06.260 --> 2:13:11.260
 But anyway, so when people say my LDL is high

2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:15.360
 or my LDL is 100, what are they saying?

2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:17.760
 They're saying the cholesterol concentration

2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:21.440
 of my LDL particles is 100 milligrams per deciliter.

2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:24.560
 So the total cholesterol concentration you have

2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:27.080
 in your circulation is that number

2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:27.960
 that says total cholesterol.

2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:28.960
 So if someone's blood panel says

2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:30.520
 my total cholesterol is 200,

2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:32.960
 it means that if you take all the lipoproteins

2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:34.840
 in their circulation, bust them open

2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:36.360
 and measure the cholesterol content,

2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.400
 it's 200 milligrams per deciliter.

2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:40.520
 And for all intents and purposes,

2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:42.920
 because the IDLs are so short-lived,

2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:45.340
 that's basically the sum of your LDL cholesterol,

2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:47.880
 your VLDL cholesterol, and your HDL cholesterol.

2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:51.560
 Those three things sum to your total cholesterol.

2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:53.680
 What about LDL little A that you mentioned earlier?

2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:55.440
 LP little A is another, yeah, yeah.

2:13:55.440 --> 2:13:56.440
 He's another actor.

2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:00.360
 He is a special type of LDL that, again,

2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:02.880
 in sort of 10 to 20% of the population

2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:04.540
 is a really bad actor.

2:14:04.540 --> 2:14:09.160
 So that's an LDL that has another apolipoprotein on it

2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:11.540
 called apolipoprotein little A.

2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:14.540
 The other thing I'll just say on this,

2:14:14.540 --> 2:14:16.960
 because earlier I mentioned apoB,

2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:19.880
 there are two broad families of lipoproteins.

2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:22.120
 There are those that are wrapped in apoBs

2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:24.400
 and those that are wrapped in apoAs.

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:27.280
 The apoA family is the HDL family.

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:31.840
 The apoB family is the VLDL, IDL, LDL family.

2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:32.680
 I see.

2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:33.900
 So for somebody who, let's say,

2:14:33.900 --> 2:14:35.200
 their total cholesterol is,

2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:37.480
 let's just stay with 200 for simplicity.

2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:41.680
 What do you like to see in terms of the HDL LDL ratio?

2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:43.100
 Couldn't care less.

2:14:43.100 --> 2:14:45.400
 I only care about apoB.

2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:47.720
 I only care about apoB.

2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:51.160
 I care about the causative agent of atherosclerosis.

2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:54.560
 apoB is the thing that drives atherosclerosis.

2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:58.120
 And what levels are attractive or repulsive for you?

2:14:58.120 --> 2:15:02.120
 When you see levels of apoB that are blank,

2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:04.600
 you get really concerned.

2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:05.440
 What rate?

2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:06.960
 It depends on the person's objectives.

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:10.520
 So again, we take a very different view.

2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:12.240
 I mean, we have...

2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:15.360
 Vitality now, and I want to live to be 100.

2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:18.640
 Yeah, so if you tell me you want to live to be 100,

2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:20.160
 you're going to need to keep your apoB

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:22.360
 below 30 milligrams per deciliter.

2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:25.140
 Let's say I want to live to be 100,

2:15:25.140 --> 2:15:29.640
 but I also, well, how about I don't care how long I live,

2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:32.560
 but I want to feel great while I live.

2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:33.840
 Again, it depends, right?

2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:35.360
 Like anybody who's had a heart attack

2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:37.180
 is going to be compromised in their ability

2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:39.440
 to feel well after, right?

2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:40.260
 So-

2:15:40.260 --> 2:15:42.240
 I guess I say it that way,

2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:43.880
 because if you're going to tell me that,

2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:46.920
 I mean, in order to achieve that live to 100 level,

2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:50.100
 I'm going to have to give up my personal life

2:15:50.100 --> 2:15:53.040
 and my brain functioning,

2:15:53.040 --> 2:15:54.280
 then I'm not really interested in it.

2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:57.040
 Sure, but to get LDL levels,

2:15:57.040 --> 2:15:58.880
 and really, again, people think of it as LDL.

2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:00.160
 It's really apoB, right?

2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:04.280
 ApoB is this total concentration of LDL and VLDL,

2:16:04.280 --> 2:16:05.120
 and that's what matters.

2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:06.840
 Those are the big atherogenic particles.

2:16:06.840 --> 2:16:10.080
 LDL also includes the Lp little a,

2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:11.560
 although the concentration of Lp little a

2:16:11.560 --> 2:16:13.640
 is relatively speaking so small

2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:16.760
 that it doesn't generally show up as much in the apoB.

2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:20.200
 So we treat apoB, and basically what it comes down to

2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:23.320
 is you want apoB to be as close to the level

2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:24.880
 as it was when you were born.

2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:27.800
 So we start developing heart disease when we're born.

2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:29.860
 That's just the way it is.

2:16:29.860 --> 2:16:32.840
 The autopsy studies make this abundantly clear.

2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:36.220
 When you look at autopsies of young people

2:16:36.220 --> 2:16:37.520
 who are dying in their 20s,

2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:39.360
 and this was first done in the 1970s,

2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:40.700
 it was again repeated.

2:16:40.700 --> 2:16:42.520
 Again, it's always done after we have a war, right?

2:16:42.520 --> 2:16:46.120
 So in the 1970s, it was done on people who died in Vietnam.

2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:48.960
 In the early 2000s, it was done on mostly young men

2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:50.800
 but some young women who were dying

2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:52.440
 in Iraq and Afghanistan.

2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:54.560
 And we saw without any ambiguity

2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:56.880
 that cardiovascular disease is already taking hold

2:16:56.880 --> 2:16:59.060
 in people who are 18, 19, 20 years old.

2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:03.220
 And to be clear, they aren't gonna die of atherosclerosis

2:17:03.220 --> 2:17:04.060
 at that age.

2:17:04.060 --> 2:17:06.100
 They're still 40, 50 years away from it,

2:17:06.100 --> 2:17:09.280
 but this is a lifelong disease.

2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:12.920
 And we also know that the disease can't really develop

2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:16.040
 until apoB reaches a certain threshold.

2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:17.560
 And that's the threshold that most of us get to

2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:20.000
 by the time we're sort of in our teens.

2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.300
 So it's this really young apoB level

2:17:23.300 --> 2:17:26.480
 of kind of 20 to 30 milligrams per deciliter

2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:28.920
 that makes it impossible to get atherosclerosis.

2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:31.000
 So apoB is necessary

2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:34.280
 but not sufficient to develop ASCVD.

2:17:34.280 --> 2:17:35.400
 Now that, go ahead.

2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:36.520
 Oh, I'm sorry, I was just gonna ask

2:17:36.520 --> 2:17:39.840
 what are some of the top behavioral nutritional

2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:42.280
 supplementation, if any, based

2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:45.800
 and prescription drug based ways to target apoB?

2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:50.480
 Well, nutritionally, you basically have two big tools, right?

2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:52.680
 And it depends on what's driving up apoB.

2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:56.920
 So apoB, remember, is the concentration of LDL

2:17:56.920 --> 2:17:58.260
 and VLDL particles.

2:17:58.260 --> 2:18:00.520
 And what do they carry?

2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:02.160
 Cholesterol and triglycerides.

2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:05.360
 So anything that reduces cholesterol

2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:09.840
 and reduces triglycerides is going to reduce apoB.

2:18:09.840 --> 2:18:13.720
 Triglycerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake.

2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:17.300
 So more insulin resistance, more carbohydrate intake,

2:18:17.300 --> 2:18:19.040
 more triglycerides.

2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:22.460
 So we, I mean, clinically, this is readily apparent

2:18:22.460 --> 2:18:23.880
 to anyone who treats patients.

2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:25.360
 If you restrict carbohydrates,

2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:27.120
 you will reduce triglycerides.

2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.020
 That just happens all day long.

2:18:29.020 --> 2:18:31.960
 But if you reduce triglycerides by raising fat intake

2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:35.240
 so much, it can still raise apoB.

2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:37.040
 So you have to be able to think about it.

2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:41.700
 So in an ideal world, it's can you lower saturated fat,

2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:44.880
 which tends to be the one that is most driving apoB,

2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:48.060
 while lowering carbohydrate and then see what you can get.

2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:49.580
 But here's the reality of it is,

2:18:49.580 --> 2:18:51.880
 there's nobody with dietary intervention

2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:52.960
 that's going to get to a level

2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.640
 of 30 milligrams per deciliter.

2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:55.720
 I mean, I've never seen any.

2:18:55.720 --> 2:18:57.040
 Pure dietary intervention.

2:18:57.040 --> 2:18:57.880
 Yeah.

2:18:57.880 --> 2:18:58.720
 So what are the other things that can move the-

2:18:58.720 --> 2:18:59.880
 It's gotta be pharmacologic at this point.

2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:01.200
 Statin type interventions.

2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:03.040
 Well, now you have multiple classes of drugs.

2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:05.160
 So the tried and true is the statin.

2:19:05.160 --> 2:19:08.280
 So statins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis.

2:19:08.280 --> 2:19:11.000
 And the net effect of that is that the,

2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.600
 so the liver is really sensitive to cholesterol levels.

2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:14.520
 It doesn't want too much.

2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:15.860
 It doesn't want too little.

2:19:15.860 --> 2:19:18.080
 When you inhibit cholesterol synthesis,

2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:20.800
 the liver says, I want more cholesterol.

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:23.660
 So it puts more LDL receptors on its surface

2:19:23.660 --> 2:19:26.640
 and it pulls the LDL out of circulation.

2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:30.780
 That's what lowers the LDL in the circulation.

2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:35.840
 So, you know, again, nine statins in use today.

2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:38.760
 We typically use four of them.

2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:42.440
 The side effect profile, contrary to kind of all the

2:19:42.440 --> 2:19:46.120
 sort of statin hating propaganda out there, very benign.

2:19:46.120 --> 2:19:48.280
 5% of people experience muscle soreness,

2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:52.680
 which reverses upon cessation, you know.

2:19:52.680 --> 2:19:54.620
 Cognitive effects.

2:19:54.620 --> 2:19:58.440
 Again, I think it's, in terms of actual comparing it

2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:00.400
 at a placebo, no effect whatsoever, right?

2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:02.360
 So does that mean that you put a patient on it,

2:20:02.360 --> 2:20:03.720
 they won't complain of something?

2:20:03.720 --> 2:20:05.720
 No, but if you look at clinical trials,

2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:07.420
 there's no evidence whatsoever

2:20:07.420 --> 2:20:09.380
 that statins impair cognition.

2:20:09.380 --> 2:20:11.260
 There's also no evidence in clinical trials

2:20:11.260 --> 2:20:13.240
 that they accelerate the risk of neurodegenerative disease.

2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:14.560
 In fact, it's the opposite.

2:20:14.560 --> 2:20:18.240
 Now we will, there's a very nuanced case we make.

2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:19.900
 Andrew, which is we'll look at patients

2:20:19.900 --> 2:20:23.320
 with highly suppressed desmostrol levels.

2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:24.720
 We will back off.

2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:28.380
 We do want to maintain desmostrol above a certain level

2:20:28.380 --> 2:20:31.720
 because of some evidence that is still,

2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:32.880
 I think, very preliminary,

2:20:32.880 --> 2:20:35.160
 but enough for us that we say, why take the chance?

2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:37.200
 We have so many other tools to lower cholesterol.

2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:39.340
 Why would we over suppress synthesis

2:20:39.340 --> 2:20:40.840
 in a susceptible individual?

2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:45.480
 So the next tool you look at is a drug

2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:48.220
 that blocks the absorption or the reabsorption

2:20:48.220 --> 2:20:49.060
 of cholesterol.

2:20:49.060 --> 2:20:51.560
 Remember that Niemann-Pixie-1-like-1 transporter?

2:20:51.560 --> 2:20:55.520
 So that guy has a drug called ezetimibe

2:20:55.520 --> 2:20:57.280
 that just mechanically blocks it.

2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:01.320
 So in people, and that's why I mentioned earlier,

2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:03.560
 we measure all those sterols in people,

2:21:03.560 --> 2:21:05.720
 so we also measure things called phytosterols,

2:21:05.720 --> 2:21:07.460
 and the phytosterols give us an indication

2:21:07.460 --> 2:21:09.320
 of how active that transporter is.

2:21:09.320 --> 2:21:10.640
 So the higher your phytosterols,

2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:13.600
 the more likely you are to respond to ezetimibe.

2:21:13.600 --> 2:21:15.960
 Next class of drugs is a drug

2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.320
 that blocks cholesterol synthesis, but only in the liver.

2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:19.920
 So the statin does it globally.

2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:23.400
 This other drug called benbedoic acid

2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:24.600
 does it only in the liver.

2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:26.720
 So it has a very similar mechanism to statins,

2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:29.880
 different enzyme, not quite as potent,

2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:31.220
 but way fewer side effects.

2:21:31.220 --> 2:21:33.560
 So any patient that's having a response to statins

2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:35.960
 that's adverse will try this other thing.

2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:37.080
 What's it called one more time?

2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:37.920
 Benbedoic acid.

2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:39.160
 Benbedoic acid.

2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:43.000
 The most potent drug of the lot is the PCSK9 inhibitor.

2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:46.080
 So PCSK9, it's a protein that was discovered

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:48.960
 in the late 90s, I believe,

2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:53.440
 is responsible for the degradation of LDL receptors.

2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:55.800
 This was first discovered in people

2:21:55.800 --> 2:21:56.960
 who had a condition called

2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:59.440
 familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH.

2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:01.680
 So these are people that have incredibly high cholesterol.

2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:05.580
 Typically, their total cholesterol level is 300.

2:22:05.580 --> 2:22:08.240
 Their LDL cholesterol is typically

2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:10.160
 north of 200 milligrams per deciliter.

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:14.280
 This is a disease that is defined by the phenotype,

2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:15.120
 not the genotype.

2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:17.060
 So the phenotype has a very clear definition,

2:22:17.060 --> 2:22:18.640
 which I basically just gave you.

2:22:18.640 --> 2:22:21.600
 The genotype is there's a million paths to get there.

2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:23.200
 There's over 3,000 mutations

2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:25.000
 that are known to produce that phenotype.

2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:26.800
 This was discovered to be one of them.

2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:29.800
 In people who had hyperfunctioning PCSK9,

2:22:33.040 --> 2:22:35.440
 this protein was just constantly hammering

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:37.540
 and destroying the LDL receptors,

2:22:37.540 --> 2:22:39.960
 and so their LDL would be huge.

2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:41.800
 And by extension, their total cholesterol would be.

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:46.800
 So in 19, sorry, in 2006, Helen Hobbs and colleagues

2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:49.840
 discovered an opposite group of population,

2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:52.460
 people who had LDL cholesterol naturally

2:22:52.460 --> 2:22:55.060
 of 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter,

2:22:55.060 --> 2:22:58.160
 which would be an ApoB of about 20 milligrams per deciliter,

2:22:59.820 --> 2:23:00.840
 and who never got heart disease.

2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:01.880
 They were immune to heart disease,

2:23:01.880 --> 2:23:03.200
 no matter how long they lived.

2:23:03.200 --> 2:23:04.280
 And they had the opposite.

2:23:04.280 --> 2:23:07.080
 They had hypofunctioning PCSK9.

2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:09.200
 And so that was 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:11.200
 That basically got a whole bunch of drug companies

2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:14.000
 hot on the trail of producing a drug to mimic it.

2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:15.760
 So now we have these antibodies,

2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:17.800
 and they're wildly effective.

2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:22.160
 What percentage of your patients over 45

2:23:22.160 --> 2:23:24.120
 do you have on either a statin

2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:25.400
 or on one of these other classes?

2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:29.280
 Well, often it's in combinations, and I would say 80%.

2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:30.100
 Eight zero.

2:23:30.100 --> 2:23:32.440
 We have to remember what our objective is.

2:23:32.440 --> 2:23:34.660
 We're in the business of trying to make sure

2:23:34.660 --> 2:23:36.800
 people live as long as possible.

2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:39.640
 And you have to take a sort of worldview of this, right?

2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:41.360
 If you, like, what's the most prevalent

2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:42.760
 cause of death globally?

2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:43.600
 It's the cardiovascular disease.

2:23:43.600 --> 2:23:45.640
 Yeah, and like, how close is it?

2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:48.360
 So the last year before COVID,

2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:49.800
 COVID kind of messes up these numbers a little bit,

2:23:49.800 --> 2:23:54.800
 but if you go to 2019, 18.6 million people

2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:56.740
 died of heart disease.

2:23:56.740 --> 2:23:59.260
 Number two, cancer, 10 million.

2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:05.040
 Like, nothing's in the zip code of atherosclerosis.

2:24:05.040 --> 2:24:06.640
 And if you remember what I just said,

2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:09.700
 if you took everybody in their 20s

2:24:09.700 --> 2:24:14.060
 and reduced them to a level of that of a child,

2:24:14.060 --> 2:24:16.460
 you'd make ASCBD an orphan disease.

2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:20.080
 So the question is, can you do that?

2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:21.280
 Why don't we hear more about this?

2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:22.480
 I realize there's some nuance.

2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:24.000
 It's not straightforward.

2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.480
 It's not as simple as saying eat less cheese, red meat,

2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:29.520
 and watch your LDL get on a statin.

2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:33.600
 But why do we hear so little about ApoB

2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:35.040
 in the general discussion?

2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:38.600
 Social media is such a skewed landscape, as we know.

2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:44.600
 People shouting into tunnels of varying clarity.

2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:48.600
 Some are beautiful bronze tunnels

2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:51.080
 with clean walls and others are sewer lines, right?

2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:55.760
 And they all converge in the same place, as we know.

2:24:55.760 --> 2:24:57.400
 But why do we hear so little about this?

2:24:57.400 --> 2:24:59.460
 I mean, I'm not on a statin,

2:24:59.460 --> 2:25:00.360
 but now I'm beginning to think

2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:02.320
 that maybe that might be a good idea to consider

2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:04.000
 one of these other compounds.

2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:05.280
 I don't know the last time I looked

2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:06.560
 at my ApoBs specifically.

2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:07.780
 I'm guessing my physician did.

2:25:07.780 --> 2:25:10.520
 But why don't we hear more about this?

2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:12.920
 This sounds so important.

2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:14.720
 It sounds like the most important conversation

2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:16.820
 because all the hormone stuff and all the stuff

2:25:16.820 --> 2:25:21.820
 about smoking and head injuries and ADHD and all the rest,

2:25:21.880 --> 2:25:24.400
 I mean, is irrelevant if you're dead, right?

2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:26.160
 Yeah, it's a good question.

2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:27.500
 I don't think I have a great insight

2:25:27.500 --> 2:25:30.480
 as to why this isn't more front and center.

2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:34.200
 I think the bigger problem

2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:36.480
 is why don't we even understand how to think about it?

2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:39.280
 I mean, and there's a whole chapter in my book

2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:42.040
 I'm working on that really gets to this problem

2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:46.840
 of why aren't we looking at atherosclerosis

2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:49.400
 in terms of treating the causative agent?

2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:53.040
 Instead, we look at modifying 10-year risk.

2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:54.220
 So that's the fundamental difference

2:25:54.220 --> 2:25:57.000
 between what I call Medicine 2.0 and Medicine 3.0.

2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:00.120
 Medicine 2.0, which is what we're generally practicing today,

2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:03.460
 when it comes to ASCBD says, look, we will treat you.

2:26:03.460 --> 2:26:05.280
 We will lower that LDL cholesterol.

2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:06.560
 They still don't talk about ApoB,

2:26:06.560 --> 2:26:08.320
 but that's a very American thing.

2:26:08.320 --> 2:26:09.740
 If you go outside of the United States,

2:26:09.740 --> 2:26:11.000
 everybody's talking about ApoB.

2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:12.800
 It's in the guidelines in Europe and Canada,

2:26:12.800 --> 2:26:13.640
 everywhere else.

2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:15.660
 The United States is very stubborn on this,

2:26:15.660 --> 2:26:18.040
 and it's due to a couple of really weird personalities

2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:19.080
 in the lipid world.

2:26:23.340 --> 2:26:28.340
 But the paradigm is when your 10-year risk reaches 5%,

2:26:28.340 --> 2:26:30.300
 and there's a 5% chance that you're gonna have

2:26:30.300 --> 2:26:32.820
 a heart attack, stroke, or die in the next 10 years,

2:26:32.820 --> 2:26:34.180
 now it's time to treat you.

2:26:35.380 --> 2:26:38.580
 Medicine 3.0 says that's not the way to think about it.

2:26:38.580 --> 2:26:40.820
 You treat the causative agent.

2:26:40.820 --> 2:26:43.620
 If there's a causative agent, you treat it.

2:26:43.620 --> 2:26:46.060
 If blood pressure raises the risk of heart disease,

2:26:46.060 --> 2:26:47.500
 you lower blood pressure.

2:26:47.500 --> 2:26:50.460
 If smoking raises the risk of something, you treat smoking.

2:26:52.660 --> 2:26:56.300
 And the reason that the risk model is so bad

2:26:56.300 --> 2:26:57.700
 when you're looking at 10-year risk

2:26:57.700 --> 2:27:01.620
 is age is the biggest driver of risk, I mean, bar none.

2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:06.260
 So if you take a 70-year-old with perfect lipids

2:27:06.260 --> 2:27:09.220
 and perfect blood pressure and perfect everything,

2:27:09.220 --> 2:27:13.660
 their 10-year risk of ASCVD is probably four

2:27:13.660 --> 2:27:18.260
 to five times higher than the most unhealthy 30-year-old.

2:27:18.260 --> 2:27:19.100
 It's not even close.

2:27:19.100 --> 2:27:21.180
 Yeah, there's a lot like eye disease.

2:27:21.180 --> 2:27:22.220
 There are exceptions, of course,

2:27:22.220 --> 2:27:23.820
 but you always say that the biggest risk factor

2:27:23.820 --> 2:27:27.620
 for going blind from glaucoma is being an older person.

2:27:27.620 --> 2:27:30.420
 An older person, frankly.

2:27:30.420 --> 2:27:31.500
 Right, so if you could identify

2:27:31.500 --> 2:27:33.740
 what the risk factors are for glaucoma,

2:27:33.740 --> 2:27:37.740
 imagine if the paradigm was we're only gonna treat it

2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:40.340
 when your risk of blindness reaches 5%,

2:27:40.340 --> 2:27:42.460
 which isn't triggered until you're old enough.

2:27:42.460 --> 2:27:45.140
 Anyway, wouldn't you rather know that when you're 30

2:27:45.140 --> 2:27:48.340
 and say, wait, if maybe being in the sun without sunglasses

2:27:48.340 --> 2:27:51.540
 or using this type of eye drop or something like that

2:27:51.540 --> 2:27:53.980
 has a negative impact, I would rather know that sooner.

2:27:53.980 --> 2:27:56.580
 So that's the fundamental difference.

2:27:56.580 --> 2:28:01.580
 It's a philosophical difference with respect to prevention.

2:28:01.860 --> 2:28:06.140
 And I will acknowledge that in one element of prevention,

2:28:06.140 --> 2:28:08.180
 I make no consideration.

2:28:08.180 --> 2:28:11.060
 I am only coming at this through the lens of the individual.

2:28:11.060 --> 2:28:13.980
 I am never coming at this through the lens of society.

2:28:13.980 --> 2:28:16.220
 That makes my life easier

2:28:16.220 --> 2:28:17.660
 and it makes the problem I'm solving easier.

2:28:17.660 --> 2:28:19.020
 I don't have to answer

2:28:19.020 --> 2:28:21.260
 the quality-adjusted life-year problem.

2:28:21.260 --> 2:28:23.260
 I don't have to ask the question,

2:28:23.260 --> 2:28:26.700
 is it economical to treat people at 30?

2:28:26.700 --> 2:28:27.900
 I don't know the answer to that question.

2:28:27.900 --> 2:28:29.520
 But I also know that when you're trying to solve

2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:30.520
 really complicated problems,

2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:31.940
 the more you can simplify, the better.

2:28:31.940 --> 2:28:34.840
 So I've just acknowledged openly, not solving that.

2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:36.780
 If you wanna criticize me for it, that's fine.

2:28:36.780 --> 2:28:38.240
 Let's be transparent.

2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:41.020
 But all I care about is the person I'm sitting across from.

2:28:41.020 --> 2:28:43.820
 And in that situation, it's really their decision

2:28:43.820 --> 2:28:46.660
 if they can justify the cost of treatment.

2:28:46.660 --> 2:28:50.300
 An esoteric question and then a less esoteric question.

2:28:50.300 --> 2:28:52.500
 The esoteric question relates to something

2:28:52.500 --> 2:28:54.020
 that I think is a little bit niche,

2:28:54.020 --> 2:28:56.580
 but not necessarily so,

2:28:56.580 --> 2:29:00.280
 which is peptides and stem cells and PRP.

2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:02.760
 I don't wanna go off on too much of a tangent on rehab,

2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:04.260
 but I know you've done a number of posts

2:29:04.260 --> 2:29:05.380
 on social media recently

2:29:05.380 --> 2:29:07.700
 that I have to just tell you are really thoughtful

2:29:07.700 --> 2:29:09.260
 and I really appreciate that you're willing to share

2:29:09.260 --> 2:29:12.260
 your own tissue rehabilitation experience

2:29:12.260 --> 2:29:13.100
 and point people to that,

2:29:13.100 --> 2:29:16.020
 because this is a landscape that a lot of people are in

2:29:16.020 --> 2:29:17.740
 and they don't know how to navigate it.

2:29:17.740 --> 2:29:20.260
 And a mutual friend of ours, not to be named,

2:29:20.260 --> 2:29:23.600
 sent me a text and said, I'm gonna be talking to Atiyah

2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:25.340
 and what do you know about studies

2:29:25.340 --> 2:29:28.340
 on things like BPC-157, this gastric peptide,

2:29:28.340 --> 2:29:32.160
 that anecdotally, again, anecdotally,

2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:34.460
 people report getting injections of this

2:29:34.460 --> 2:29:35.900
 in the shoulder, knee, et cetera,

2:29:35.900 --> 2:29:38.100
 and feeling so much better, so much faster,

2:29:38.100 --> 2:29:42.380
 but there really aren't good studies, controlled studies.

2:29:42.380 --> 2:29:44.900
 And you hear all the same sorts of things

2:29:44.900 --> 2:29:47.780
 about platelet-rich plasma, PRP,

2:29:47.780 --> 2:29:50.500
 which someone tells you there are a lot of stem cells in them

2:29:50.500 --> 2:29:52.620
 they're lying, there are not a lot of stem cells in them.

2:29:52.620 --> 2:29:54.080
 And you also hear about stem cells,

2:29:54.080 --> 2:29:55.300
 which are not FDA approved,

2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.700
 at least for most uses in this country,

2:29:57.700 --> 2:29:59.900
 but are certainly people are flying down to Columbia

2:29:59.900 --> 2:30:00.900
 and getting injections.

2:30:00.900 --> 2:30:04.120
 And what is your understanding or experience

2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:06.940
 with things like BPC-157 specifically,

2:30:06.940 --> 2:30:08.380
 because peptides is a huge landscape,

2:30:08.380 --> 2:30:10.580
 we should probably do a whole episode on peptides,

2:30:10.580 --> 2:30:12.580
 things like PRP.

2:30:12.580 --> 2:30:14.500
 PRP is now approved for, I mean,

2:30:14.500 --> 2:30:16.500
 women are getting injections of this into their ovaries

2:30:16.500 --> 2:30:20.260
 to improve follicle count, we know this.

2:30:20.260 --> 2:30:21.500
 People are getting injections of PRP

2:30:21.500 --> 2:30:23.940
 into every tissue and organ in it.

2:30:23.940 --> 2:30:25.900
 Hell, men are getting injected into their penis,

2:30:25.900 --> 2:30:30.440
 so I hear, for all sorts of reasons that are unclear to me.

2:30:32.100 --> 2:30:35.780
 What's the deal with PRP, BPC-157, and stem cells?

2:30:35.780 --> 2:30:38.060
 Do you ever see interesting effects?

2:30:38.060 --> 2:30:40.860
 Are you curious about these compounds?

2:30:40.860 --> 2:30:43.420
 Do you prescribe or direct people towards these?

2:30:43.420 --> 2:30:44.580
 The FDA approved ones, of course.

2:30:44.580 --> 2:30:47.540
 Yeah, so short answer is I'm definitely curious about them

2:30:47.540 --> 2:30:48.900
 and I'd love to see the work done,

2:30:48.900 --> 2:30:50.860
 but I also think this is about

2:30:50.860 --> 2:30:53.060
 as wild, wild west as it gets.

2:30:53.060 --> 2:30:57.940
 PRP less so, but certainly stem cells and peptides.

2:30:57.940 --> 2:31:02.940
 And I just think if you're gonna do something

2:31:03.860 --> 2:31:04.820
 without a clinical trial,

2:31:04.820 --> 2:31:06.540
 you gotta show up with a lot more data.

2:31:06.540 --> 2:31:08.580
 So let's use rapamycin as an example.

2:31:08.580 --> 2:31:10.260
 I'm a huge proponent of rapamycin,

2:31:10.260 --> 2:31:11.260
 and you can say, well, Peter,

2:31:11.260 --> 2:31:14.220
 how can you take or prescribe rapamycin

2:31:14.220 --> 2:31:15.820
 for zero protective effects

2:31:15.820 --> 2:31:17.580
 when we do not have a human clinical trial

2:31:17.580 --> 2:31:19.860
 demonstrating that it lengthens life?

2:31:19.860 --> 2:31:24.740
 And the answer is because I have 84 other pieces of data

2:31:24.740 --> 2:31:27.760
 that all point in the same direction

2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:29.860
 across every model organism

2:31:29.860 --> 2:31:31.960
 going back more than a billion years.

2:31:32.980 --> 2:31:37.980
 And that's really different from Joey, Sammy, and Sally

2:31:37.980 --> 2:31:40.660
 did this thing, and I think it works.

2:31:40.660 --> 2:31:43.060
 And they just can't be compared.

2:31:43.060 --> 2:31:46.220
 Now, I have no idea if stem cells work.

2:31:46.220 --> 2:31:49.500
 I have no idea if BPC157 works.

2:31:49.500 --> 2:31:52.620
 I have no idea, frankly, if PRP even works,

2:31:52.620 --> 2:31:54.660
 though it might seem to have some efficacy

2:31:54.660 --> 2:31:55.900
 and some indications.

2:31:55.900 --> 2:31:59.340
 For example, maybe when it comes to early hair loss,

2:31:59.340 --> 2:32:03.620
 maybe when it comes to certain joint issues.

2:32:05.120 --> 2:32:06.380
 But the reality of it is like,

2:32:06.380 --> 2:32:08.260
 I think we just have to accept the fact

2:32:08.260 --> 2:32:11.460
 that everything we do has an opportunity cost,

2:32:11.460 --> 2:32:15.020
 and that opportunity cost is sometimes financial.

2:32:15.020 --> 2:32:16.660
 But I actually find a lot of times

2:32:16.660 --> 2:32:20.860
 it's in time and effort and energy that goes into something.

2:32:20.860 --> 2:32:24.980
 Now, when I was waiting to get my shoulder surgery,

2:32:24.980 --> 2:32:27.020
 this is an injury that I've had forever, right?

2:32:27.020 --> 2:32:27.860
 This is an injury,

2:32:29.620 --> 2:32:33.060
 this injury was actually probably the greatest source

2:32:33.060 --> 2:32:35.660
 of discomfort I had swimming the Catalina Channel

2:32:35.660 --> 2:32:37.000
 the last time in 2009.

2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.400
 So that tells you how long I've had this injury.

2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:42.240
 But I sort of knew at some point like,

2:32:42.240 --> 2:32:44.140
 I'm gonna have to have it fixed.

2:32:44.140 --> 2:32:46.200
 And I sort of went down this rabbit hole like,

2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:49.160
 hey, is there anything I can do to avoid having surgery?

2:32:49.160 --> 2:32:52.120
 Would infusing a million stem cells into it work?

2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:56.440
 And in speaking with as many orthopedic surgeons as I could,

2:32:56.440 --> 2:32:59.260
 the answer was kind of unambiguously no.

2:33:00.120 --> 2:33:01.800
 And by the way, it doesn't mean you wouldn't feel better

2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:03.960
 if I injected a bunch of stem cells into your shoulder.

2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:05.880
 There are a lot of reasons that might make you feel better.

2:33:05.880 --> 2:33:07.960
 Just like there are a bunch of reasons you can feel better

2:33:07.960 --> 2:33:10.960
 if somebody injects saline directly into your joint.

2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:14.800
 So the question is, is it going to fix the underlying

2:33:14.800 --> 2:33:18.480
 problem and if so, will it do so by what mechanism?

2:33:18.480 --> 2:33:21.220
 So I'm pretty sure that if you took a thousand people

2:33:21.220 --> 2:33:25.040
 with my particular injury and injected them with stem cells,

2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:27.800
 it wouldn't do a thing because of the nature of my injury.

2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:29.760
 I had a complete labral tear.

2:33:31.200 --> 2:33:33.400
 Are there some injuries that might benefit from it?

2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:34.760
 Yeah, possible.

2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:37.380
 So the question is, how would you design the trial

2:33:37.380 --> 2:33:40.980
 to narrow down your patient population correctly

2:33:40.980 --> 2:33:42.640
 so that you might see a signal?

2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:45.360
 Because the other risk of doing a trial is,

2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:48.800
 you have too much of a heterogeneous patient population,

2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:51.000
 you don't know what the heck you're really doing

2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.080
 and you get meaningless results.

2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:55.620
 You get a null result when in fact there's a small signal

2:33:55.620 --> 2:33:57.580
 but you were underpowered to pick it up

2:33:57.580 --> 2:34:00.680
 because you only had 10% of your patient population

2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:03.180
 that was the right patient population to get that.

2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:05.660
 So will we ever get there?

2:34:05.660 --> 2:34:08.520
 I don't know because I don't see what the incentive is.

2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:11.320
 You have people who are making money hand over fist

2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:16.240
 doing procedures on the basis of, I'm not sure what,

2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:18.520
 what would their motivation or incentive be

2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:21.160
 to see this legitimized.

2:34:21.160 --> 2:34:22.560
 You'd really have to be able to say,

2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:25.840
 well, there really needs to be a pharma angle to this.

2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:29.360
 It's one of the wishes I had.

2:34:29.360 --> 2:34:31.920
 If I was a billionaire,

2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:35.040
 I feel like the way I would probably waste all of my money

2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:36.760
 would be running clinical trials

2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:38.280
 on stuff nobody cared about.

2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:39.100
 It would just be-

2:34:39.100 --> 2:34:41.560
 Likewise, I would join you because that would be,

2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:46.000
 yesterday we recorded a sit down with somebody from Caltech

2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:49.360
 who works on aggression and rage

2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:50.940
 and other things related to that

2:34:50.940 --> 2:34:54.580
 and has identified peptides that are approved the FDA

2:34:54.580 --> 2:34:57.240
 for other reasons that seem to adjust anxiety,

2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:00.240
 might even adjust aggression and pathologic aggression

2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:02.080
 and went off onto a long description

2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:04.220
 of why none of these drugs exist on the market

2:35:04.220 --> 2:35:05.640
 for the treatment of psychiatric illness

2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:07.960
 and yet probably would work.

2:35:09.140 --> 2:35:12.400
 And what's missing is a billionaire

2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:14.400
 or a billion dollar company

2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:16.080
 that is willing to invest in something

2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:17.720
 that very likely will work,

2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:20.360
 but the market value isn't quite there

2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:22.520
 or it failed in a previous trial

2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:25.180
 and so no one wants to touch it with a 10 foot pole.

2:35:25.180 --> 2:35:27.560
 Hopefully someone listening to this will be incentivized

2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:30.400
 to provide this sort of a venue for that,

2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:32.440
 the kind of work that we're talking about.

2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:34.480
 I have to ask-

2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:35.880
 But I wanna make one other point, Andrew,

2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:40.680
 which is to me the problem with a lot of these things

2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:43.600
 is it gets, it's a crutch.

2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:45.400
 It's sort of like what we talked about with like,

2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:47.800
 hey, just fix my T-man and everything's gonna be fine

2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:50.680
 and it's like, no, that's just the beginning.

2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:52.380
 What I worry about when I see people

2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:54.480
 who are clamoring for this stuff

2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:56.920
 is a lot of times they don't realize

2:35:56.920 --> 2:35:59.120
 that whether it's psychologically or otherwise,

2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:00.920
 they sort of say, well, now that I've had this thing done,

2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:03.120
 I don't have to do the hard work of the real rehab.

2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:05.140
 I mean, if I've learned anything through my shoulder surgery

2:36:05.140 --> 2:36:06.960
 and I'm now three and a half months out-

2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:07.800
 How does it feel?

2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:08.620
 Amazing.

2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:10.560
 I mean, look, I still can't do a lot of stuff.

2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:12.080
 It's gonna be a while.

2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:13.860
 I haven't even been able to shoot a bow yet

2:36:13.860 --> 2:36:17.560
 and it'll probably be a year before I'll go back

2:36:17.560 --> 2:36:19.960
 to long dead hangs and heavy dead lifts.

2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:21.240
 I mean, I don't know, maybe nine months,

2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:23.300
 but I'm not there yet.

2:36:23.300 --> 2:36:26.720
 But what I learned through a really amazing

2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:31.720
 rehab and rehab process is you just gotta do the work

2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:35.120
 and it's freaking hard.

2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:38.560
 Shoulders are the most tedious, boring thing in the world.

2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:41.560
 I mean, three days a week, I am doing,

2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:44.000
 four days a week, I am doing one hour

2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:47.740
 of just dedicated stuff for this shoulder

2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:52.740
 that is super uncomfortable, super boring,

2:36:52.740 --> 2:36:57.100
 super frustrating, but I mean,

2:36:57.100 --> 2:36:59.500
 I have faith in the methodology, right?

2:36:59.500 --> 2:37:01.040
 And I think a lot of people are saying,

2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:02.440
 just shoot the stem cells into me

2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:03.700
 and I don't have to do any of that stuff.

2:37:03.700 --> 2:37:05.740
 And the reality of it is I think

2:37:05.740 --> 2:37:08.020
 that's a very dangerous place to be.

2:37:08.940 --> 2:37:10.700
 Have you ever tried BPC157?

2:37:11.820 --> 2:37:14.140
 Yeah, we tried it.

2:37:14.140 --> 2:37:16.900
 We had, again, maybe seven, eight years ago,

2:37:16.900 --> 2:37:18.620
 we had a bunch of patients ask about it.

2:37:18.620 --> 2:37:22.060
 So my view is, okay, I was pretty convinced

2:37:22.060 --> 2:37:23.900
 that there was no safety downside to it.

2:37:23.900 --> 2:37:25.700
 So I was like, well, I wouldn't prescribe it to a patient

2:37:25.700 --> 2:37:26.900
 unless I tried it myself.

2:37:26.900 --> 2:37:29.900
 So me and another doc in the practice, Ralph,

2:37:29.900 --> 2:37:32.300
 we did it for, I don't know, a couple of months.

2:37:32.300 --> 2:37:34.340
 I didn't notice a single thing.

2:37:34.340 --> 2:37:35.500
 Interesting.

2:37:35.500 --> 2:37:36.980
 Well, thank you for that.

2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:38.900
 Shifting to a less esoteric,

2:37:40.140 --> 2:37:43.500
 and I think probably more important topic overall,

2:37:43.500 --> 2:37:45.520
 metabolomics, we're talking about this

2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:47.360
 before we set down to record.

2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:50.060
 What is, what are metabolomics?

2:37:50.060 --> 2:37:52.900
 Why should we be thinking about them?

2:37:52.900 --> 2:37:55.940
 I have some idea of what it might be about,

2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:58.300
 but most people I think are not thinking

2:37:58.300 --> 2:38:01.060
 about metabolomics at all.

2:38:01.060 --> 2:38:03.620
 And for those that are, I'm sure they could learn more.

2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:05.660
 So tell us about metabolomics and what you'd like

2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:08.500
 to see more of in the world of metabolomics.

2:38:08.500 --> 2:38:10.420
 Yeah, so omics is just the term that we use

2:38:10.420 --> 2:38:12.500
 to describe the study of something.

2:38:12.500 --> 2:38:15.220
 So genomics, right, is like the broad study of genes

2:38:15.220 --> 2:38:18.340
 and proteomics, the broad study of proteins

2:38:18.340 --> 2:38:19.480
 and things like that.

2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:22.340
 So metabolomics is the study of metabolites,

2:38:22.340 --> 2:38:25.620
 and metabolites, unlike a lot of these other things,

2:38:25.620 --> 2:38:28.480
 they're a relatively finite number of these things,

2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:30.720
 many of which are known, but some of which are not known.

2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:34.060
 So glucose is a metabolite, acetyl-CoA is a metabolite,

2:38:34.060 --> 2:38:35.780
 lactate is a metabolite.

2:38:35.780 --> 2:38:39.500
 And so the question is, what do we know

2:38:39.500 --> 2:38:42.300
 about these things and how they work?

2:38:42.300 --> 2:38:44.520
 And more importantly, what do we know

2:38:44.520 --> 2:38:46.420
 about certain physiologic states

2:38:46.420 --> 2:38:49.360
 and the metabolomic profile that results from them?

2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:54.360
 So let's use two extreme examples, like exercise.

2:38:54.540 --> 2:38:58.020
 Everybody understands, the data are unambiguously clear,

2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:00.400
 exercise produces about the most

2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:03.720
 favorable phenotype imaginable.

2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:06.460
 So if you wanted to take a genomics approach

2:39:06.460 --> 2:39:08.900
 to understanding that, you might look at,

2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:11.660
 is there a change in the genome when you exercise?

2:39:11.660 --> 2:39:13.380
 And the answer is probably not,

2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:17.060
 but maybe if you looked at the methylation patterns

2:39:17.060 --> 2:39:19.940
 in epigenome, you could look at epigenomic studies.

2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:22.220
 But you might instead look

2:39:22.220 --> 2:39:23.980
 at kind of the proteomic side of that,

2:39:23.980 --> 2:39:26.620
 like what is gene expression doing?

2:39:26.620 --> 2:39:28.620
 And there you would see a lot of changes.

2:39:28.620 --> 2:39:30.340
 Well, what I don't think people are really understanding,

2:39:30.340 --> 2:39:31.860
 although there was a very interesting paper

2:39:31.860 --> 2:39:35.120
 that just came out two weeks ago,

2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:39.960
 that looks for novel metabolites that are changing.

2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:44.500
 Is there a huge signal in a metabolomic profile

2:39:44.500 --> 2:39:47.100
 that looks different in the state of exercise

2:39:47.100 --> 2:39:50.420
 versus non-exercise, and could that represent

2:39:50.420 --> 2:39:53.120
 part of how exercise is transmitting

2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:54.620
 its benefit through the body?

2:39:56.120 --> 2:39:58.780
 People always talk about the holy grail of metabolomics

2:39:58.780 --> 2:40:02.100
 would be can you find a pill to mimic exercise?

2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:03.100
 And I think the answer to that question

2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:07.060
 is going to be undoubtedly no, for a couple reasons.

2:40:07.060 --> 2:40:10.420
 One, even if you could mimic the longevity,

2:40:10.420 --> 2:40:12.100
 sort of lifespan parts of it,

2:40:12.100 --> 2:40:14.980
 you could never mimic the healthspan parts of it.

2:40:14.980 --> 2:40:16.540
 But what if you could do both, right?

2:40:16.540 --> 2:40:18.700
 What if there were small molecules

2:40:18.700 --> 2:40:21.460
 that can replicate some of the protective benefits

2:40:21.460 --> 2:40:23.980
 of exercise, and you could combine those with exercise?

2:40:23.980 --> 2:40:25.500
 What if those could be treatments

2:40:25.500 --> 2:40:28.620
 for other disease states, like diabetes, things like that?

2:40:28.620 --> 2:40:30.380
 So that's why I think this field of metabolomics

2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:35.380
 is relatively untapped, and I think,

2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:38.260
 potentially the next sort of frontier.

2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:40.260
 Speaking of frontiers, I hear a lot nowadays

2:40:40.260 --> 2:40:45.260
 about GLP-1 and pharmacology, prescription drugs

2:40:45.580 --> 2:40:48.980
 that mimic or increase GLP-1 directly.

2:40:50.500 --> 2:40:53.540
 Glucon, like peptide, people are talking about this

2:40:53.540 --> 2:40:55.760
 as the blockbuster obesity drug.

2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:57.580
 I haven't heard this much talk about a drug

2:40:57.580 --> 2:41:01.240
 to adjust human body weight favorably

2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:04.040
 since the discussions of Fen-Phen when I was in college,

2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:06.440
 and then of course, Fen-Phen was pulled from the market

2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:09.200
 because people were dying, not left and right,

2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:11.340
 but enough people died that they pulled it from the market.

2:41:11.340 --> 2:41:14.180
 Which, by the way, is an interesting story.

2:41:14.180 --> 2:41:17.060
 It was the enantiomer that they chose to use

2:41:17.060 --> 2:41:18.740
 that was the wrong enantiomer,

2:41:18.740 --> 2:41:23.120
 and what it resulted in was, God, I think it was like.

2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:25.060
 So mitral valve, prolapse.

2:41:25.060 --> 2:41:28.660
 It was an MVP, yeah, it was something in the mitral valve.

2:41:28.660 --> 2:41:30.680
 Yeah, I think the chordae tendineae were rupturing

2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:34.140
 in the mitral valve, and it was mostly young women,

2:41:34.140 --> 2:41:36.660
 I think, were getting horrible pulmonary disease

2:41:36.660 --> 2:41:38.940
 as a result of it, probably pulmonary hypertension

2:41:38.940 --> 2:41:40.100
 or something like that.

2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:43.940
 But there were two enantiomers of the drug,

2:41:43.940 --> 2:41:45.860
 and had they just used the other one,

2:41:45.860 --> 2:41:47.260
 this issue wouldn't have happened,

2:41:47.260 --> 2:41:49.620
 and there was a stupid reason why they made the choice

2:41:49.620 --> 2:41:51.980
 to use the one they did, and it's one of those things

2:41:51.980 --> 2:41:53.780
 where once you make the mistake, you're never going back.

2:41:53.780 --> 2:41:54.940
 It's not like that company could say,

2:41:54.940 --> 2:41:56.380
 okay, we want to do over,

2:41:56.380 --> 2:41:57.940
 but we're gonna do it with the right version.

2:41:57.940 --> 2:42:02.020
 So it's a tragic outcome, but you're absolutely right.

2:42:02.020 --> 2:42:05.560
 I think the GLP-1 agonists have more efficacy,

2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:10.400
 and for all intensity and for everything we can see,

2:42:10.400 --> 2:42:11.760
 it certainly seems safer.

2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:13.000
 Are you excited about them?

2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:13.840
 Yeah, I am, yeah.

2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:15.160
 I mean, I think we're just seeing

2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:16.880
 the kind of tip of the iceberg.

2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:18.500
 They're not miracle drugs, right?

2:42:18.500 --> 2:42:19.820
 They come with problems, right?

2:42:19.820 --> 2:42:23.620
 Which is, they're catabolic across the board,

2:42:23.620 --> 2:42:25.680
 so patients are losing fat,

2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:28.600
 but they're losing muscle as well, so.

2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:31.560
 You just sent all the Jim jockeys running

2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:34.800
 from semaglutinol, and that's all you have to say.

2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:36.600
 All you have to say nowadays about something

2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:38.640
 is that it's gonna drop testosterone,

2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:41.840
 lower fertility, change someone's skin, hair, or nails,

2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:43.680
 and it's like people,

2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:46.120
 it could extend life to being 250 years old

2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:47.800
 and people are gone.

2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:48.640
 Humans are humans.

2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:51.080
 That's a neuroscience and psychology issue,

2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:54.000
 not a biology medicine issue.

2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.160
 But I'm pleased to hear that you're excited by them

2:42:56.160 --> 2:42:58.040
 because I hear a lot of excitement.

2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:01.320
 I haven't heard anything disastrous about them.

2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:03.440
 It takes a while to get people up to dose,

2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:05.240
 so if you're looking at semaglutide,

2:43:05.240 --> 2:43:07.220
 the dose that was studied,

2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:09.620
 so they did a one-year trial,

2:43:09.620 --> 2:43:11.760
 or maybe it was a little over that, maybe 60 weeks,

2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:15.700
 but it took about 16 weeks to get the patients comfortably

2:43:15.700 --> 2:43:17.460
 up to 2.4 milligrams weekly,

2:43:17.460 --> 2:43:20.120
 which was the dose that they ultimately stayed on.

2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:21.840
 In our experience, when we use it,

2:43:21.840 --> 2:43:24.160
 we don't even usually go up to 2.4 milligrams.

2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:25.240
 We can usually get enough benefit

2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:26.840
 between one and two milligrams,

2:43:26.840 --> 2:43:28.960
 and we usually move people along a little bit quicker,

2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:30.940
 but we've definitely had our share of patients

2:43:30.940 --> 2:43:32.800
 who can't tolerate it due to the nausea.

2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:33.640
 Interesting.

2:43:33.640 --> 2:43:35.780
 Which might be part of how it's working, right,

2:43:35.780 --> 2:43:37.980
 is sort of suppression of appetite,

2:43:37.980 --> 2:43:41.220
 which if taken to an extreme can produce nausea.

2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:42.060
 Interesting.

2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:44.100
 Yeah, I think most of the effect of semaglutide

2:43:44.100 --> 2:43:45.760
 is central, not peripheral.

2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:47.560
 Huh, so I don't know.

2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:52.560
 I saw one paper that GLP-1 is acting both on cells

2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:57.680
 in the periphery to cause gut distension in some ways,

2:43:57.680 --> 2:43:59.640
 or sort of make people feel full

2:43:59.640 --> 2:44:03.320
 through promotion of literally mechanoreceptors

2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.520
 that make people feel as if their stomach is distended,

2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:06.760
 even though their stomach is empty,

2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:09.080
 and then perhaps some central hypothalamic effects.

2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:09.920
 Is that what you think?

2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:11.360
 Yeah, I think it's doing,

2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:14.080
 I would bet 80% of it's in the hypothalamus.

2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:18.140
 It is also improving insulin sensitivity in the periphery,

2:44:18.140 --> 2:44:20.040
 but I don't think that that's accounting

2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:22.040
 for much of its benefit.

2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:22.880
 Super interesting.

2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:25.960
 And there's next-gen versions of these

2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:27.480
 that seem to be more long-lasting.

2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:31.080
 So right now, if you look at coming off semaglutide,

2:44:31.080 --> 2:44:32.880
 you're going to see a weight regain.

2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:36.120
 So there's newer versions that seem to preserve

2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:38.240
 the weight loss, even off the drug.

2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:39.880
 So it begs the ultimate question, which is like,

2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:42.200
 what's the total use case for this going to be?

2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:44.540
 Is this going to be a drug you cycle on and off,

2:44:44.540 --> 2:44:45.440
 or is it going to be a drug

2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:47.080
 that a person has to stay on indefinitely?

2:44:47.080 --> 2:44:48.860
 And if so, will they become tachyphylactic?

2:44:48.860 --> 2:44:51.680
 Will they gain a resistance to it?

2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:54.220
 So it's still super early days on these things.

2:44:54.220 --> 2:44:55.920
 My hope is that it would be a little bit like

2:44:55.920 --> 2:44:57.400
 the way that you described testosterone

2:44:57.400 --> 2:44:59.280
 and estrogen therapy is that it would allow people

2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:00.960
 to do more of the behavioral work

2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:04.360
 that's absolutely required for healthspan and lifespan.

2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:07.240
 Yep, and we've also seen on the flip side of that,

2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:11.240
 you can cheat through semaglutide, right?

2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:13.920
 People who, you know, you can drink a lot of calories

2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:17.280
 and sort of get around the drug.

2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:19.680
 So, you know, for example, like, you know,

2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:21.740
 we always encourage patients who want to lose weight

2:45:21.740 --> 2:45:23.160
 to really just eliminate alcohol.

2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:27.800
 Like that's the cheapest, easiest trick to lose weight.

2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:30.200
 And so if you're still drinking a lot of alcohol,

2:45:30.200 --> 2:45:32.000
 which is incredibly caloric,

2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.480
 and just drinking a lot of caloric stuff,

2:45:35.400 --> 2:45:37.560
 we've seen that that's less,

2:45:37.560 --> 2:45:39.660
 this is just anecdotal with our patients,

2:45:39.660 --> 2:45:43.000
 but we've seen that it's easier to get around

2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.720
 the benefits of the drug that way.

2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:47.260
 Interesting.

2:45:47.260 --> 2:45:49.260
 I so appreciate your answers today.

2:45:49.260 --> 2:45:51.900
 First of all, they were incredibly thorough

2:45:51.900 --> 2:45:54.920
 and pointed towards real-world application.

2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:58.080
 I also just want to thank you more broadly

2:45:58.080 --> 2:45:59.640
 for the work that you do,

2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:02.240
 because obviously you have this incredible

2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:04.560
 clinical experience and patient population

2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:06.020
 that you work very closely with.

2:46:06.020 --> 2:46:08.480
 But I see you really as one of the few,

2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:13.040
 both clinicians, and I realize you're an MD.

2:46:13.040 --> 2:46:14.160
 Did you do a PhD as well?

2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:17.480
 No, but I consider you a scientist clinician,

2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:19.400
 a clinician scientist is the appropriate wording

2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:20.400
 of that, of course,

2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:22.720
 in the way that you really still drill

2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:24.160
 into studies in detail.

2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:25.160
 I know a lot of clinicians,

2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:28.320
 not all of them do that for sure.

2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:29.600
 And the fact that you're so hungry

2:46:29.600 --> 2:46:31.280
 for the new incoming knowledge,

2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:33.000
 as well as the old literature.

2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:35.720
 So it's an incredibly rich data set

2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:37.020
 in that brain of yours.

2:46:37.020 --> 2:46:39.360
 And I really appreciate you sharing it with us,

2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:41.960
 both in your podcast and the upcoming book,

2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:45.680
 which I think that we'll certainly have you on here again

2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:46.640
 in anticipation of that.

2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:48.640
 But I know I and a ton of other people

2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:50.320
 are really excited for the book.

2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:52.240
 And in the way that you approach social media

2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:54.580
 and podcasts and going on podcasts.

2:46:54.580 --> 2:46:55.560
 Thank you so much.

2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:56.400
 I learned a ton.

2:46:56.400 --> 2:46:58.360
 I know everyone learned a ton.

2:46:58.360 --> 2:46:59.180
 Thanks, Andrew.

2:46:59.180 --> 2:47:00.240
 Great to be here, man.

2:48:17.100 --> 2:48:18.400
 please do so.

2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:20.160
 We are Huberman Lab on Twitter,

2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:22.200
 and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.

2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:25.520
 And both places I cover science and science-related tools,

2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:27.120
 some of which overlap with the content

2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:28.280
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:30.480
 but much of which is unique from the content

2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:32.040
 covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:33.720
 Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram

2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:35.380
 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.

2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:38.280
 Please also check out our Neural Network monthly newsletter.

2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:41.800
 This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.

2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:44.080
 It also includes a lot of actionable protocols.

2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:46.120
 It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.

2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:48.280
 You go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,

2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:50.360
 go to newsletter, you supply your email,

2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:52.360
 but we do not share your email with anybody.

2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:55.240
 We have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy,

2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:57.460
 which is we do not share your email with anybody.

2:48:57.460 --> 2:48:59.980
 And the newsletter comes out once a month,

2:48:59.980 --> 2:49:01.520
 and it is completely zero cost.

2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:03.560
 Again, just go to HubermanLab.com

2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:06.000
 and go to the Neural Network newsletter.

2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.320
 I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:09.500
 has a clips channel.

2:49:09.500 --> 2:49:13.860
 So these are brief clips, anywhere from three to 10 minutes,

2:49:13.860 --> 2:49:17.440
 that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols

2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:20.600
 related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.

2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:22.000
 We talk about things like caffeine,

2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.440
 when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,

2:49:24.440 --> 2:49:25.700
 alcohol, when and how,

2:49:25.700 --> 2:49:28.820
 and if anyone should ingest it relative to sleep,

2:49:28.820 --> 2:49:31.440
 dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health,

2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:32.360
 and on and on,

2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:34.280
 all the things that relate to the topics

2:49:34.280 --> 2:49:35.640
 most of interest to you.

2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:38.300
 You can find that easily by going to YouTube,

2:49:38.300 --> 2:49:41.200
 look for Huberman Lab clips in the search area,

2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:42.040
 and it will take you there.

2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:44.380
 Subscribe, and we are constantly updating those

2:49:44.380 --> 2:49:45.220
 with new clips.

2:49:45.220 --> 2:49:46.640
 This is especially useful, I believe,

2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:48.640
 for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes,

2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:50.260
 or you're still working through the back catalog

2:49:50.260 --> 2:49:51.340
 of Huberman Lab Podcasts,

2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:53.480
 which admittedly can be rather long.

2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:55.760
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:49:55.760 --> 2:49:57.560
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:49:57.560 --> 2:50:26.060
 I'll see you in the next one.
