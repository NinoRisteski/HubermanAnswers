00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.320 --> 00:04.960
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.960 --> 00:05.980
 for everyday life.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.680
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.680 --> 00:16.000
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.840
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.840 --> 00:19.560
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.060
 It is, however, part of my desire to bring zero cost

00:22.060 --> 00:23.960
 to consumer information about science

00:23.960 --> 00:27.280
 and science-related tools to the general public.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.800
 Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors

00:29.800 --> 00:31.080
 of the podcast.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.420
 The first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.580
 Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using

00:35.580 --> 00:38.720
 since 2012, long before I launched this podcast.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.320
 So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.320
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:43.320 --> 00:46.160
 vitamin mineral probiotic supplement.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.520
 It's a greens drink that you mix with water.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.840
 I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.720
 And it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need

00:55.720 --> 00:59.000
 as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me

00:59.000 --> 01:01.160
 because there are a lot of data now showing

01:01.160 --> 01:05.280
 that gut health is important for the gut-brain axis,

01:05.280 --> 01:08.640
 things like mood, immunity, et cetera.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.200
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

01:10.200 --> 01:13.080
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.240
 And if you do that, they'll send you a year supply

01:16.240 --> 01:19.520
 of liquid vitamin D3 and K2.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.580
 Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know,

01:22.580 --> 01:24.920
 has been shown to be important for various aspects

01:24.920 --> 01:26.560
 of immune system function,

01:26.560 --> 01:29.480
 as well as other biological pathways,

01:29.480 --> 01:31.600
 metabolic function, et cetera.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.640
 So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens,

01:33.640 --> 01:36.340
 you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

01:36.340 --> 01:40.840
 and they will send you a year supply of the D3, K2.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.400
 This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.600
 Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.060
 I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens

01:51.060 --> 01:53.320
 with more off than on,

01:53.320 --> 01:55.780
 mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to.

01:55.780 --> 01:56.880
 Some people are very good

01:56.880 --> 02:00.200
 at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.780
 I'm in the latter category.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.360
 However, I find that when I have something

02:03.360 --> 02:06.240
 to guide my meditation, such as Headspace,

02:06.240 --> 02:08.480
 it makes it much easier for me to be consistent

02:08.480 --> 02:10.480
 about my meditation practice.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.560
 There is now tons of data out there

02:13.560 --> 02:15.120
 in quality peer-reviewed journals

02:15.120 --> 02:19.120
 showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition,

02:19.120 --> 02:21.200
 recovery of mental function,

02:21.200 --> 02:24.120
 recovery of physical ability, et cetera.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.040
 So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation

02:26.040 --> 02:29.640
 practice, Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy

02:29.640 --> 02:32.600
 to learn and maintain a meditation practice.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.200
 If you want to try Headspace,

02:34.200 --> 02:38.120
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

02:38.120 --> 02:41.100
 And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace

02:41.100 --> 02:42.800
 for an entire month for free.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.080
 So zero risk there.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.720
 That's headspace.com slash special offer

02:46.720 --> 02:48.800
 to try Headspace, the meditation app,

02:48.800 --> 02:50.920
 for one month for free.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.520
 Today's podcast episode is about sleep

02:53.520 --> 02:54.920
 and wakefulness.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.000
 We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.460
 babies, kids, and the elderly.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.680
 And we are going to discuss protocols

03:03.680 --> 03:05.660
 that are backed by science.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.840
 That means quality peer-reviewed papers published

03:07.840 --> 03:12.200
 in excellent journals that can support particular tools

03:12.200 --> 03:15.520
 that you can use to combat things like jet lag,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.960
 offset some of the negative effects of shift work

03:17.960 --> 03:21.000
 and make life easier for the new parent

03:21.000 --> 03:24.580
 as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent,

03:24.580 --> 03:27.180
 anyone that wants to sleep better,

03:27.180 --> 03:30.120
 feel better when they're awake, et cetera.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.440
 If you've listened to the previous three episodes

03:32.440 --> 03:34.040
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

03:34.040 --> 03:37.640
 we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness

03:37.640 --> 03:40.960
 and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.860
 And we've been discussing parameters like light,

03:43.860 --> 03:47.500
 exercise, temperature, et cetera.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.260
 If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

03:50.260 --> 03:55.220
 Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.200
 If you haven't, that's okay.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.360
 I will provide a little bit of background here or there

03:59.360 --> 04:02.420
 so that it's not necessary that you have listened

04:02.420 --> 04:03.640
 to those previous episodes.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.160
 But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.560
 I think it will help you digest the information better.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.960
 Let's just take a step back for a moment

04:12.960 --> 04:15.440
 and remind everybody what we're talking about.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.840
 We're talking about an endogenous,

04:17.840 --> 04:21.840
 meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.200
 The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour rhythm

04:25.200 --> 04:28.300
 in all sorts of functions.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.760
 The most prominent one is a rhythm

04:30.760 --> 04:34.240
 in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.880
 So believe it or not,

04:35.880 --> 04:38.320
 the experiment has been done throughout history,

04:38.320 --> 04:39.720
 not often, but it's been done

04:39.720 --> 04:42.080
 where people will go down into a cave

04:42.080 --> 04:45.520
 and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.840
 There are also cases where people have been

04:46.840 --> 04:49.340
 in constant light for some period of time.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.100
 But because people can close their eyes,

04:51.100 --> 04:53.160
 it's actually easier to do the experiment

04:53.160 --> 04:54.580
 where you're in constant darkness

04:54.580 --> 04:57.280
 to address the question of what is the endogenous,

04:57.280 --> 04:59.680
 meaning the internal rhythm that we all have.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.360
 And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours,

05:03.360 --> 05:05.140
 although it's not exactly 24 hours,

05:05.140 --> 05:08.280
 meaning every 24 hours,

05:08.280 --> 05:11.440
 your body temperature goes from low to high

05:11.440 --> 05:13.000
 and back down to low again.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.040
 And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.620
 Not 18, not six, 24, plus or minus a couple hours.

05:20.580 --> 05:23.820
 You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness

05:23.820 --> 05:24.760
 that correlates with that.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.240
 We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling,

05:28.240 --> 05:33.240
 getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking

05:33.260 --> 05:35.800
 when our temperature is increasing.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.400
 This is a biological fact.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.880
 It is right down to our DNA.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.360
 We actually have genes in every single one of our cells

05:42.360 --> 05:46.520
 that ensure that every cell is on this 24-hour-ish rhythm,

05:46.520 --> 05:47.700
 close to 24 hours.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.120
 We have a clock over the roof of our mouth,

05:52.120 --> 05:55.240
 a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.840
 That clock generates a 24-hour rhythm,

05:58.840 --> 06:00.740
 and that clock is entrained,

06:00.740 --> 06:04.920
 meaning it is matched to the external light-dark cycle,

06:04.920 --> 06:08.100
 which is, no surprise, 24 hours.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.500
 Spinning the Earth takes 24 hours.

06:10.500 --> 06:15.500
 So our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature,

06:17.640 --> 06:21.680
 but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood,

06:21.680 --> 06:25.560
 all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle.

06:25.560 --> 06:29.000
 And if we are living our life in a perfect way

06:29.000 --> 06:32.760
 where we wake up in the morning and we view sunlight

06:32.760 --> 06:34.620
 as it crosses the horizon,

06:34.620 --> 06:37.300
 and then by evening we catch a little sunlight,

06:37.300 --> 06:40.960
 and then at night we're in complete darkness,

06:40.960 --> 06:43.200
 we will be more or less perfectly matched

06:43.200 --> 06:45.840
 to the external or ambient light-dark cycle.

06:46.860 --> 06:50.120
 Very few of us do that because of these things

06:50.120 --> 06:51.760
 that we call artificial lights

06:51.760 --> 06:55.080
 and this other thing that we call life demands.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.160
 So today we're going to talk about

06:57.160 --> 07:00.000
 when we get pulled away from that rhythm.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.260
 Now, you may immediately be thinking,

07:03.260 --> 07:05.080
 well, I've heard there are night owls

07:05.080 --> 07:06.660
 and there are morning larks.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.560
 They're sometimes called and they're genetic polymorphisms.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.000
 That's just a fancy name for genetic variations

07:12.000 --> 07:13.560
 that make some people want to wake up early

07:13.560 --> 07:14.840
 and other people want to stay up late

07:14.840 --> 07:16.440
 and teens want to sleep in more.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.340
 Sure, that's all true.

07:18.340 --> 07:20.800
 That's all true regardless of what names we give those.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.600
 However, there's no escaping the fact

07:23.600 --> 07:26.120
 that human beings are a diurnal species.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.680
 We were designed, literally,

07:28.680 --> 07:30.800
 our cells and the circuits of our body

07:30.800 --> 07:34.240
 were constructed to be awake during the daytime

07:34.240 --> 07:35.560
 and asleep at night.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.560
 How do I know that?

07:36.560 --> 07:39.120
 Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,

07:39.120 --> 07:42.980
 but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown

07:42.980 --> 07:47.300
 that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule

07:47.300 --> 07:50.700
 and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off,

07:50.700 --> 07:52.400
 but serious health effects,

07:52.400 --> 07:55.240
 both mental and physical, start to arise.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.020
 I'm not going to spend much of today

07:57.020 --> 07:59.180
 talking about all the negative effects of jet lag.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.920
 I'll talk a little bit about it

08:00.920 --> 08:02.600
 or the negative effects of shift work

08:02.600 --> 08:04.600
 or trying to scare you by telling you

08:04.600 --> 08:09.600
 about the quite valid data around depression,

08:09.960 --> 08:13.920
 amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen

08:13.920 --> 08:15.020
 when you're not sleeping well.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.840
 Rather, I'd like to focus on what you can do

08:16.840 --> 08:18.620
 and arm you with tools.

08:18.620 --> 08:21.800
 So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment

08:21.800 --> 08:23.520
 and then let's talk about jet lag

08:23.520 --> 08:26.160
 and what jet lag really represents

08:26.160 --> 08:30.160
 and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster

08:30.160 --> 08:33.520
 and escape some of the severe bad things

08:33.520 --> 08:34.880
 that can happen with jet lag,

08:34.880 --> 08:36.660
 including just feeling miserable

08:36.660 --> 08:38.840
 when you're traveling for work or vacation.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.000
 So what is the perfect day?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.080
 What does that look like

08:42.080 --> 08:45.280
 from a circadian sleep wakefulness standpoint?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.960
 Well, I'm about to summarize what I've said

08:46.960 --> 08:50.760
 in the three previous podcast episodes

08:50.760 --> 08:53.580
 as well as now countless Instagram posts.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.200
 Here's the deal.

08:56.200 --> 09:01.200
 You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight,

09:01.200 --> 09:05.040
 but as much light into your eyes

09:05.040 --> 09:07.320
 during the period of each 24 hour cycle

09:07.320 --> 09:10.780
 when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert.

09:10.780 --> 09:14.400
 And you want to get as little light into your eyes

09:15.280 --> 09:17.040
 at the times of that 24 hour cycle

09:17.040 --> 09:20.880
 when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.160
 How much is enough?

09:23.160 --> 09:26.640
 Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure

09:26.640 --> 09:27.640
 that you damage your eyes

09:27.640 --> 09:30.040
 because as many of you heard me say before,

09:30.040 --> 09:32.440
 the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain,

09:32.440 --> 09:33.340
 your central nervous system

09:33.340 --> 09:35.080
 that were extruded out of your skull.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.900
 And as pieces of the central nervous system,

09:36.900 --> 09:40.280
 AKA your brain, they will not regenerate.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.160
 At least right now, the technologies don't exist

09:42.160 --> 09:43.600
 to regenerate those neurons in humans.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.400
 You do not want to damage them.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.780
 So what is too bright?

09:46.780 --> 09:49.360
 Well, when it's painful to look at.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.720
 When you have to blink or close your eyes

09:50.720 --> 09:51.560
 in order to bear it.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.720
 So please don't look at very bright lights

09:54.720 --> 09:58.440
 so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes.

09:58.440 --> 10:02.480
 However, if you get up in the morning

10:02.480 --> 10:05.960
 and it's still dark out and you want to be awake,

10:05.960 --> 10:09.320
 you would be wise to turn on artificial lights,

10:09.320 --> 10:10.560
 in particular overhead lights

10:10.560 --> 10:12.080
 for reasons I've discussed previously,

10:12.080 --> 10:14.880
 but those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons,

10:14.880 --> 10:17.540
 these melanopsin cells in the retina

10:17.540 --> 10:20.180
 that will activate your circadian clock.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.800
 When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover,

10:23.800 --> 10:26.040
 the sun does come out every day,

10:26.040 --> 10:27.800
 regardless of where you live,

10:27.800 --> 10:29.440
 unless you live in a cave.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.280
 People have said to me,

10:30.280 --> 10:32.440
 well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.160
 Well, the sun is there.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.080
 It might be hiding behind clouds,

10:37.080 --> 10:39.060
 unless it's very, very dark where you live,

10:39.060 --> 10:42.000
 like Scandinavia and the depths of winter,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.220
 which case you might want some artificial light.

10:44.220 --> 10:47.000
 Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.920
 Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light

10:49.920 --> 10:51.760
 that I have not discussed previously.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.960
 A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux,

10:56.960 --> 10:59.320
 L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.440
 A good number to shoot for, as a rule of thumb,

11:03.440 --> 11:07.600
 is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux

11:08.460 --> 11:12.640
 before 9 a.m., 10 a.m. maybe,

11:12.640 --> 11:14.360
 but before 9 a.m.,

11:14.360 --> 11:19.360
 assuming you're waking up sometime between 5 and 8 a.m.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.380
 Okay, so get 100,000 lux.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.120
 Now you do not, I want to repeat,

11:23.120 --> 11:25.980
 you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux

11:25.980 --> 11:28.540
 or a 100,000 lux light.

11:28.540 --> 11:29.780
 It's very, very bright.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.000
 The mechanism of circadian clock setting,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.780
 and this is very important,

11:35.780 --> 11:37.780
 the mechanism of circadian clock setting

11:37.780 --> 11:40.240
 involves these neurons in your eye

11:40.240 --> 11:41.680
 that send electrical signals

11:41.680 --> 11:44.100
 to this clock above the roof of your mouth,

11:44.100 --> 11:47.960
 and that system sums, meaning it adds photons.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.760
 It's a very slow system.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.740
 So let's say that I wake up

11:51.740 --> 11:55.660
 and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen.

11:55.660 --> 11:57.800
 That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.560
 If I were to look at that for a full minute,

12:00.560 --> 12:02.800
 I would get that photon energy

12:02.800 --> 12:04.840
 transferred into electrical energy of neurons,

12:04.840 --> 12:06.920
 and it would be communicated to my circadian clock.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.920
 However, the signal that it's morning

12:08.920 --> 12:12.340
 will not have registered with the circadian clock

12:12.340 --> 12:17.000
 unless I looked at that for 100 minutes or more.

12:17.000 --> 12:17.880
 So 100,000.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.880
 Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock,

12:20.880 --> 12:23.720
 you're not going to get enough light from artificial light

12:23.720 --> 12:26.000
 before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.920
 So you have this opportunity before 9 a.m., maybe 10 a.m.,

12:29.920 --> 12:32.080
 to capture enough photons,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.720
 and you have to do it with your eyes.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.400
 I've discussed why that's important

12:36.400 --> 12:38.000
 in previous episodes of the podcast,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.320
 but you have to do it with your eyes.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.520
 There is no extraocular photoreception.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.240
 This is not about vitamin D in your skin.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.400
 This is about setting your circadian clock,

12:46.400 --> 12:48.760
 which is paramount for mental and physical health.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.200
 So here we're talking about trying to get that

12:50.200 --> 12:52.700
 at least 100,000 photons, but not all at once,

12:52.700 --> 12:56.300
 but you got to get them before 9 a.m. ish, maybe 10 a.m.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.140
 So what do you do?

12:57.140 --> 12:58.260
 You go outside.

12:58.260 --> 13:01.200
 If you want to get nerdy about this, quantitative,

13:01.200 --> 13:03.780
 you could download a free app like Light Meter

13:03.780 --> 13:06.260
 and take a look around your house with Light Meter,

13:06.260 --> 13:08.840
 and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights

13:08.840 --> 13:13.240
 are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.360
 It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights

13:15.360 --> 13:17.800
 with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock

13:17.800 --> 13:21.000
 and tell your brain and body that it's morning.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.500
 Going outside, even on a cloudy day,

13:24.380 --> 13:26.480
 could be 7,000, 10,000 lux.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.040
 It's really remarkable how bright it is,

13:29.040 --> 13:30.960
 meaning how much photon energy is coming through.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.840
 So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9 a.m.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.640
 Now, if you can't do that because you live

13:36.640 --> 13:40.380
 in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough,

13:40.380 --> 13:43.860
 some people have sent me pictures from Northern England,

13:43.860 --> 13:45.940
 it's just not bright enough in winter,

13:45.940 --> 13:49.840
 then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights

13:49.840 --> 13:52.360
 in order to get enough photons.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.800
 And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target

13:55.800 --> 13:57.620
 to get each day before 9 a.m.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.400
 You can, in theory, get it all from artificial lights,

14:01.400 --> 14:03.460
 but there are some special qualities about sunlight

14:03.460 --> 14:05.640
 that make sunlight the better stimulus.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.700
 First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.920
 There is a number of different, there are, excuse me,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.120
 a number of different technologies,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.240
 kind of like this one, like a light pad,

14:16.240 --> 14:18.840
 that this one says it's 930 lux.

14:18.840 --> 14:19.960
 I'm covering this up

14:19.960 --> 14:21.820
 because I'm not trying to promote any specific products.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.760
 I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.000
 They're not a sponsor.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.520
 And it lets you toggle the brightness,

14:27.520 --> 14:30.400
 I think, by holding this on, holding down this button,

14:30.400 --> 14:31.760
 you can make it dimmer or brighter.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.960
 This is about 1,000 lux.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.200
 It seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside

14:35.200 --> 14:38.060
 will have five times more photon energy coming through.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.840
 So some people set these lights or ring lights

14:41.840 --> 14:43.480
 that they use for selfies and that kind of thing

14:43.480 --> 14:46.660
 near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning,

14:46.660 --> 14:48.880
 but you really want to get sunlight, okay?

14:48.880 --> 14:50.800
 So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
 and we're going to talk about jet lag,

14:52.800 --> 14:55.280
 but I can't emphasize this enough.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.440
 That light has to be captured and summed

14:57.440 --> 14:59.320
 before you enter the circadian dead zone,

14:59.320 --> 15:00.880
 which is the middle of the day.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.460
 This is, again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule.

15:05.460 --> 15:09.100
 Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature,

15:09.100 --> 15:12.120
 that you look at sunlight sometime

15:12.120 --> 15:13.940
 around the time when the sun is setting.

15:13.940 --> 15:15.280
 And the reason for that, of course,

15:15.280 --> 15:19.180
 is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes,

15:19.180 --> 15:21.700
 because here's the diabolical thing.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.860
 While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day

15:24.860 --> 15:27.020
 to wake up our system and set our circadian clock

15:27.020 --> 15:28.600
 and prepare us for a good night's sleep

15:28.600 --> 15:30.660
 14 to 16 hours later,

15:30.660 --> 15:33.000
 it takes very little photon energy

15:33.000 --> 15:37.080
 to reset and shift our clock after 8 p.m.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.920
 And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can,

15:39.920 --> 15:44.520
 avoid bright light and even not so bright light

15:44.520 --> 15:47.320
 between the hours of 10 or 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.120
 A number of people have asked me some questions about this.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.120
 In the last episode, I went into red lights.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.700
 I would have discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff

15:55.700 --> 15:57.280
 so I'm not going to repeat all that.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.380
 But here's the thing.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.400
 If you see afternoon light,

16:01.400 --> 16:04.520
 you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes

16:04.520 --> 16:07.960
 so that you have a little bit more wiggle room,

16:07.960 --> 16:11.780
 a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens

16:11.780 --> 16:14.280
 and overhead lights even late at night

16:14.280 --> 16:16.760
 without disrupting your circadian clock.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.840
 But it is a kind of a double-edged sword

16:19.840 --> 16:23.000
 where you need a lot of light early in the day

16:23.000 --> 16:26.540
 and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.700
 I've mentioned studies on here.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.120
 A number of you have asked about getting the references.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.580
 We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going

16:32.580 --> 16:33.420
 with full links.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.880
 There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.500
 But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.220
 And when people ask, I'll generally put them

16:40.220 --> 16:45.220
 in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.580
 There have been two studies done

16:47.580 --> 16:48.720
 from the University of Colorado,

16:48.720 --> 16:50.520
 both published in Current Biology.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.000
 You can easily find these online

16:52.000 --> 16:56.120
 by just Googling the words Current Biology, Camping,

16:56.120 --> 16:59.200
 and Reset Circadian Clocks that have shown

16:59.200 --> 17:02.800
 that two days of waking up with the sun

17:02.800 --> 17:04.440
 and avoiding light at night,

17:04.440 --> 17:06.360
 they actually took graduate students camping,

17:06.360 --> 17:08.080
 really cool experiment to be a part of,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.320
 reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms

17:10.320 --> 17:14.000
 for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far

17:14.000 --> 17:15.360
 from their natural rhythms.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.220
 There are other things that you can do to shift your clock

17:19.220 --> 17:20.440
 and to reinforce your clock,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.160
 like exercising more or less the same time,

17:22.160 --> 17:24.200
 eating more or less the same time, et cetera.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.640
 That's not what today's episode is about.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.000
 So I just described perfect schedule,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.420
 get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes,

17:30.420 --> 17:33.480
 not all at once, but summing across the morning.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.680
 Again, you know when it's too much

17:35.680 --> 17:37.240
 because it's painful to look at.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.080
 So that's obviously something to avoid.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.040
 But then once the middle of the day,

17:42.040 --> 17:43.500
 let's say you're waking up at 10 or 11,

17:43.500 --> 17:45.240
 you go outside, the sun's overhead, forget it.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.760
 You're not going to shift your clock.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.160
 You're just not.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.400
 It doesn't work that way.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.320
 In the evening, you see the evening light

17:53.320 --> 17:55.680
 and you want to get that light

17:55.680 --> 17:57.640
 to adjust down your retinal sensitivity

17:57.640 --> 17:59.600
 to afford you a bit of a buffer

17:59.600 --> 18:00.800
 so that late at night,

18:00.800 --> 18:01.920
 if you happen to look at screens

18:01.920 --> 18:03.180
 or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night,

18:03.180 --> 18:05.160
 it's not going to shift your clock

18:05.160 --> 18:10.160
 because it takes probably only about 1000 to 1500 lux

18:10.640 --> 18:12.120
 of light energy to shift your clock

18:12.120 --> 18:13.080
 in the middle of the night.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.560
 So let's talk about shifting clocks

18:14.560 --> 18:16.500
 because for the jet lag person,

18:17.800 --> 18:19.780
 this ability to shift the clock

18:19.780 --> 18:22.240
 with light temperature, exercise and food

18:22.240 --> 18:26.980
 is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule

18:26.980 --> 18:28.600
 and there's so much out there about jet lag.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.880
 Today, I'm going to dial it down

18:29.880 --> 18:31.960
 to one very specific parameter

18:31.960 --> 18:34.260
 that all of you can figure out

18:34.260 --> 18:37.000
 without any technology or devices

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
 and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure

18:42.380 --> 18:43.840
 or anytime you're jet lagged

18:43.840 --> 18:46.420
 and I want to absolutely emphasize

18:46.420 --> 18:48.820
 that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.760
 Many of you are jet lagged.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.360
 You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone

18:52.360 --> 18:53.320
 in the middle of the night,

18:53.320 --> 18:54.480
 you're jet lagged because you're waking up

18:54.480 --> 18:55.360
 at different times a day,

18:55.360 --> 18:57.840
 you're jet lagged because your exercise

18:57.840 --> 19:02.080
 is on a chaotic regime some days at this time,

19:02.080 --> 19:03.640
 some days at that time

19:03.640 --> 19:05.740
 and if that works for you, great.

19:05.740 --> 19:06.900
 I want to be really clear

19:06.900 --> 19:08.520
 that a number of people always say,

19:08.520 --> 19:12.000
 well, I know so-and-so that only needed four hours of sleep

19:12.000 --> 19:14.200
 and or they're just fine,

19:14.200 --> 19:16.040
 they travel to Europe and it's just fine.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.600
 There's a lot of individual variability

19:17.600 --> 19:18.880
 and we're going to talk about the origins

19:18.880 --> 19:20.280
 of some of that variability.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.000
 I mean, I know people that can eat anything

19:23.000 --> 19:25.960
 and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles

19:25.960 --> 19:30.960
 and body weight and fitness ability

19:30.960 --> 19:33.880
 and I know some people that they eat one cracker

19:33.880 --> 19:38.080
 and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears

19:38.080 --> 19:39.960
 because they think that that's going to throw them off

19:39.960 --> 19:41.800
 and then maybe it does, I don't know.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.740
 There's a tremendous amount of variability out there.

19:44.740 --> 19:49.740
 So this is really about optimal and what's possible

19:50.480 --> 19:51.400
 and you have to ask,

19:51.400 --> 19:53.120
 I can just say from personal experience,

19:53.120 --> 19:56.120
 I suffer terribly from jet lag

19:56.120 --> 19:58.880
 traveling in certain directions but not others.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.720
 Some people don't have trouble with jet lag.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.140
 Many people will travel to a new location,

20:03.140 --> 20:05.800
 they feel great for the first day and night

20:05.800 --> 20:08.120
 and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping

20:08.120 --> 20:10.420
 or they travel back and they have a terrible time

20:10.420 --> 20:12.320
 getting back onto a normal schedule

20:12.320 --> 20:14.720
 and some of this varies with age

20:14.720 --> 20:16.880
 and some of it varies with genetics

20:16.880 --> 20:20.480
 and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take

20:20.480 --> 20:23.160
 to just get rid of jet lag, it doesn't work that way.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.080
 If it worked that way, I would tell you

20:26.080 --> 20:28.580
 but there are some simple things that you can do.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.920
 I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is

20:30.920 --> 20:34.240
 and how it works and contrary to what many people out there

20:34.240 --> 20:38.080
 say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism

20:38.080 --> 20:39.940
 affords you more flexibility.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.360
 Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me

20:43.360 --> 20:45.760
 just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do?

20:45.760 --> 20:48.800
 Well, what happens when you can't do those things

20:48.800 --> 20:50.240
 in exactly the way they're written down?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.860
 When you understand mechanism,

20:52.860 --> 20:55.920
 you understand how to control the machine

20:55.920 --> 20:58.320
 that is your biological system, your nervous system.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.280
 So a little bit of understanding about mechanism

21:00.280 --> 21:02.840
 goes a really long way.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.680
 So that's where we're headed.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.880
 Let's talk about what jet lag is.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.440
 Okay, well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark

21:08.440 --> 21:11.120
 with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag

21:11.120 --> 21:12.840
 but I'm about to get dark.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.080
 There are quality peer reviewed papers

21:17.080 --> 21:20.700
 showing that jet lag will shorten your life.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.460
 It will kill you earlier.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.400
 I guess it means you'll die earlier.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.080
 It doesn't actually kill you necessarily

21:27.080 --> 21:30.840
 although there are many cases where tourists

21:30.840 --> 21:32.520
 end up stepping in front of buses,

21:32.520 --> 21:35.040
 especially in countries where the cars and buses

21:35.040 --> 21:36.520
 drive on the opposite side of the street

21:36.520 --> 21:38.080
 that they're used to,

21:38.080 --> 21:40.000
 who are jet lagged and lose their life that way.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.680
 Jet lag is a serious thing.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.560
 Sure, we had a family story about this.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.040
 When I was growing up,

21:45.040 --> 21:47.580
 I had a family member travel overseas for work

21:47.580 --> 21:49.260
 and take a sleeping pill.

21:49.260 --> 21:50.960
 I won't name the sleeping pill,

21:50.960 --> 21:53.200
 though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills

21:53.200 --> 21:57.120
 and had a case of total amnesia for a week.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.420
 That's not entirely uncommon.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.960
 If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep,

22:01.960 --> 22:03.780
 doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day,

22:03.780 --> 22:06.480
 woken up, you might not know where you are.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
 And that's because time and space are really linked

22:08.480 --> 22:10.840
 and the brain wasn't designed to be transported

22:10.840 --> 22:13.520
 four, five, six hours into a new time zone.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.160
 It just wasn't.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.480
 Our brain and the biological mechanisms

22:17.480 --> 22:19.580
 that govern circadian timing

22:19.580 --> 22:22.040
 were designed to be shifted by a couple hours,

22:22.040 --> 22:25.240
 not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.800
 So you can really mess yourself up.

22:26.800 --> 22:27.720
 I've had that experience.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.440
 I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.120
 I flew 12 hours out of phase

22:33.120 --> 22:36.060
 to Abu Dhabi once to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.920
 And it was a mess.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.820
 I actually was getting vertigo.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.680
 I wasn't hallucinating, but I was really out of it.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.320
 And my mood was just all over the place.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.080
 It was very bizarre.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.640
 Jet lag, even if you don't experience it

22:51.640 --> 22:56.080
 as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.160
 Now, here's what's interesting.

22:58.160 --> 23:03.160
 Traveling westward on the globe is always easier

23:04.540 --> 23:08.420
 than traveling eastward, okay?

23:08.420 --> 23:13.420
 It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity

23:14.200 --> 23:17.040
 have shown that traveling east

23:17.040 --> 23:22.040
 takes more years off your life than traveling west.

23:22.220 --> 23:25.660
 Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone

23:25.660 --> 23:28.400
 or three hours, just one time zone over,

23:28.400 --> 23:30.360
 or two times zone over, rather,

23:30.360 --> 23:34.240
 is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology

23:34.240 --> 23:37.600
 than a eight-hour shift or a nine-hour shift.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.280
 Now, here's what's interesting.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.000
 When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity

23:44.000 --> 23:47.220
 or this idea that it can shorten our lives,

23:49.080 --> 23:51.000
 we have to ask ourselves, why?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.060
 Why is that?

23:52.060 --> 23:54.360
 And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation

23:54.360 --> 23:55.800
 for this.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.000
 We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.200
 this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain

24:01.200 --> 24:03.700
 that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.420
 Turns out that human beings, and probably most species,

24:08.420 --> 24:12.080
 are better able to activate and stay alert

24:12.080 --> 24:15.080
 than they are to shut down their nervous system

24:15.080 --> 24:16.460
 and go to sleep on demand.

24:16.460 --> 24:18.560
 So if you really have to push

24:18.560 --> 24:20.300
 and you really have to stay awake, you can do it.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.020
 You can stay up later.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.720
 But falling asleep earlier is harder.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.320
 And that's why traveling east

24:26.320 --> 24:29.520
 has a number of different features associated with it

24:29.520 --> 24:31.640
 that, because you're traveling east,

24:31.640 --> 24:34.400
 you're trying to go to bed earlier.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.320
 As a Californian, if I go to New York City,

24:37.320 --> 24:38.880
 I've got to get to bed three hours early

24:38.880 --> 24:40.080
 and wake up three hours early,

24:40.080 --> 24:42.540
 much harder than coming back to California

24:42.540 --> 24:44.480
 and just staying up a few more hours.

24:44.480 --> 24:49.480
 And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation

24:49.560 --> 24:51.720
 where, under conditions where we need to suddenly

24:51.720 --> 24:55.240
 gather up and go or forage for food or fight

24:55.240 --> 24:57.600
 or do any number of different things

24:57.600 --> 24:58.800
 that we can push ourselves

24:58.800 --> 25:00.560
 through the release of adrenaline and epinephrine

25:00.560 --> 25:01.440
 to stay awake,

25:01.440 --> 25:04.640
 whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep

25:04.640 --> 25:06.640
 is actually much harder to do.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.860
 So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system

25:08.860 --> 25:12.280
 that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.360
 So if you want to read up on this,

25:15.360 --> 25:17.520
 because people have asked me about papers,

25:17.520 --> 25:18.360
 you can look.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.640
 There's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006,

25:21.640 --> 25:24.400
 in Current Biology that talks about the differences

25:24.400 --> 25:29.400
 in lifespan for frequent eastward versus westward

25:29.920 --> 25:34.080
 versus no travel and longevity and et cetera,

25:34.080 --> 25:37.460
 a number of different biological markers of longevity.

25:37.460 --> 25:40.960
 So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier

25:40.960 --> 25:44.160
 is harder if you're trying to do that on demand.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.780
 Many people have turned to melatonin

25:45.780 --> 25:48.120
 as a way to try and induce sleepiness.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.140
 I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.980
 I've mentioned on previous podcasts,

25:51.980 --> 25:54.000
 a number of you have asked for the evidence

25:54.000 --> 25:57.920
 that melatonin is potentially detrimental

25:57.920 --> 25:59.500
 to some hormone systems.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.520
 Melatonin is a hormone, and I'll discuss that at the end,

26:02.520 --> 26:04.100
 in particular, the role of melatonin

26:04.100 --> 26:06.200
 in suppressing a hormone pathway

26:06.200 --> 26:08.080
 that involves luteinizing hormone,

26:08.080 --> 26:11.640
 testosterone in men and estrogen in females,

26:11.640 --> 26:13.140
 as well as a really interesting peptide

26:13.140 --> 26:15.680
 called kisspeptin, that's a cool name.

26:15.680 --> 26:19.040
 All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.600
 Let's say you're not going eastward or westward,

26:22.600 --> 26:24.680
 but you're going north or south.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.200
 So if you go from, for instance,

26:26.200 --> 26:28.680
 Washington, D.C. to Santiago, Chile,

26:29.640 --> 26:34.640
 or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel to Cape Town, South Africa,

26:34.640 --> 26:38.000
 you're just going north and south, right?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.360
 And not, you know, either direction.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.800
 You're not really moving into a different time zone.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.780
 You're not shifting.

26:43.780 --> 26:47.000
 So you will experience travel fatigue.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.920
 And it turns out that jet lag has two elements,

26:48.920 --> 26:52.960
 travel fatigue and time zone jet lag.

26:52.960 --> 26:57.640
 Time zone jet lag is simply the inability

26:57.640 --> 27:01.160
 of local sunlight and local darkness

27:01.160 --> 27:04.800
 to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm

27:04.800 --> 27:06.340
 that you have.

27:06.340 --> 27:09.300
 So before we get too complicated

27:09.300 --> 27:11.780
 and too down in the weeds about this,

27:11.780 --> 27:14.080
 I want to just throw out a couple of important things.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.780
 First of all, I mentioned this earlier,

27:15.780 --> 27:17.960
 but some people suffer from jet lag a lot.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.000
 Other people, not so much.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.240
 Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.880
 There are reasons for that because early in life,

27:26.880 --> 27:31.360
 patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat

27:31.360 --> 27:33.400
 and very high actually in children.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.960
 It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.640
 Then it becomes cyclic during puberty,

27:37.640 --> 27:40.560
 meaning it comes on once every 24 hours

27:40.560 --> 27:42.040
 and turns off once every 24 hours.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.200
 It's cycles, cyclic.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.500
 And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted

27:47.500 --> 27:50.340
 and we become more vulnerable to even small changes

27:50.340 --> 27:53.600
 in schedule, et cetera, meal times, right?

27:53.600 --> 27:57.440
 So jet lag gets worse as we age.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.460
 In addition, there are other things that happen with age

28:01.460 --> 28:04.780
 that people start doing less exercise,

28:04.780 --> 28:07.280
 their digestion can get worse, et cetera.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.520
 So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects

28:10.520 --> 28:12.560
 of getting older, but some of the things

28:12.560 --> 28:14.280
 that are correlated with being older,

28:14.280 --> 28:17.000
 like people who are willing to have a regular exercise

28:17.000 --> 28:18.780
 regime can use that exercise regime

28:18.780 --> 28:20.640
 to shift their circadian clock.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.360
 And I have a good friend, his father's in his 80s.

28:24.360 --> 28:29.360
 He's still pushing out 25, 30 pushups each morning.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.600
 He's on the Peloton or whatever it is,

28:31.600 --> 28:32.440
 doing a lot of cycling.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.080
 So some 80 year olds are doing that, many are not.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.240
 And many 30 year olds are not.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.320
 But if you have a regular exercise program,

28:40.320 --> 28:44.120
 that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock

28:44.120 --> 28:45.900
 for sake of jet lag.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.780
 And it's actually a knob you can turn

28:47.780 --> 28:51.200
 and you can leverage for shifting your clock.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.360
 Before we go any further,

28:52.360 --> 28:57.360
 I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy,

28:57.920 --> 29:00.120
 or at least as easy and as simple

29:00.120 --> 29:02.960
 as one could possibly make it, I believe.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.320
 What I want to talk about is perhaps one

29:05.320 --> 29:07.680
 of the most important things to know about your body

29:07.680 --> 29:10.920
 and brain, which is called your temperature minimum.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.860
 Most of you know your approximate weight.

29:12.860 --> 29:15.140
 Some of you even know your blood pressure.

29:15.140 --> 29:18.520
 Some of you might even know your body mass index.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.620
 Some of you might know other things about your biology

29:20.620 --> 29:22.340
 that have fancy names,

29:22.340 --> 29:24.940
 but everyone should know their temperature minimum.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.960
 Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer

29:28.960 --> 29:31.360
 to measure, although you could measure it.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.840
 Your temperature minimum is the point

29:33.840 --> 29:37.500
 in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.960
 Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer?

29:41.960 --> 29:45.220
 It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before

29:45.220 --> 29:47.000
 your average waking time.

29:47.000 --> 29:47.840
 So I want to repeat that.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.300
 Your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes

29:51.300 --> 29:54.020
 to two hours before your average waking time.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.320
 So let's say you're not traveling

29:56.320 --> 29:59.940
 and your typical wake up time is 5.30 AM.

29:59.940 --> 30:04.920
 Your temperature minimum is very likely 3.30 AM or 4.00 AM.

30:04.920 --> 30:07.740
 If you want, if any of you want to,

30:07.740 --> 30:09.260
 you can measure your temperature minimum.

30:09.260 --> 30:10.160
 You can get a thermometer

30:10.160 --> 30:11.900
 and you can measure your temperature every couple hours

30:11.900 --> 30:14.720
 for 24 hours and you can find your temperature minimum.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.960
 What you're going to find is that you have a low point,

30:16.960 --> 30:18.240
 the temperature minimum,

30:18.240 --> 30:19.880
 and then your temperature will start to rise.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.660
 You'll wake up about two hours later.

30:22.660 --> 30:24.500
 Then your temperature will continue to rise

30:24.500 --> 30:25.340
 into the afternoon.

30:25.340 --> 30:27.480
 It will peak, maybe a little trough.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.800
 Sometimes that happens.

30:28.800 --> 30:33.180
 And then it'll start declining slowly

30:33.180 --> 30:34.480
 as you approach nighttime.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.960
 There are things that will disrupt

30:36.960 --> 30:38.280
 that temperature pattern.

30:38.280 --> 30:42.840
 Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, et cetera.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.760
 Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect

30:44.760 --> 30:47.000
 that increases temperature slightly, little blips,

30:47.000 --> 30:48.260
 but the overall cycle,

30:48.260 --> 30:52.040
 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.240
 And last time I talked about the seminal work

30:54.240 --> 30:56.540
 of Joe Takahashi and others who have shown

30:56.540 --> 30:58.880
 that temperature actually is the signal

30:58.880 --> 31:01.840
 by which this clock above the roof of your mouth

31:01.840 --> 31:05.380
 in trains or collectively pushes all the cells

31:05.380 --> 31:08.720
 and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.560
 Temperature is the effector.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.600
 And once you hear that, there should be an immediate,

31:13.600 --> 31:15.800
 oh, of course, because how else would you get

31:16.920 --> 31:19.220
 all these different diverse cell types

31:19.220 --> 31:21.000
 to follow one pattern, right?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.200
 A pancreatic cell does something very different

31:23.200 --> 31:27.940
 than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

31:27.940 --> 31:30.300
 They're all doing different things at different rates.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.840
 So the temperature signal can go out

31:31.840 --> 31:33.340
 and then each one of those can interpret

31:33.340 --> 31:35.360
 the temperature signal as one unified

31:35.360 --> 31:38.800
 and consistent theme of their environment.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.360
 So temperatures vary from person to person.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.960
 Some people are 98.6.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.480
 Some people run a little colder, et cetera,

31:45.480 --> 31:47.760
 but you have a low point and you have a high point.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.120
 Know your temperature minimum.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.740
 How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum?

31:51.740 --> 31:54.280
 The temperature minimum can be determined

31:54.280 --> 31:58.620
 by taking the last three to five wake up times.

31:58.620 --> 32:03.620
 So let's say you wake up 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 3 a.m.,

32:03.760 --> 32:07.080
 all right, happens, take those, add them together,

32:07.080 --> 32:09.840
 average them by adding them up

32:09.840 --> 32:11.020
 and dividing by the number of days.

32:11.020 --> 32:13.000
 That'll give you the average.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.980
 If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3 a.m.

32:14.980 --> 32:16.920
 and then goes back to sleep and sleeps till 10,

32:16.920 --> 32:19.200
 your wake up time was 10 a.m.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.680
 If you use an alarm clock,

32:20.680 --> 32:24.160
 your wake up time is still when you get up, okay?

32:25.480 --> 32:27.920
 I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized,

32:27.920 --> 32:30.680
 but in my world, being late and missing appointments

32:30.680 --> 32:33.720
 is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock.

32:35.740 --> 32:38.560
 Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.080
 There tends to be some variation for people.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.560
 Some people, it's going to vary

32:41.560 --> 32:42.800
 depending on life circumstances,

32:42.800 --> 32:45.340
 but average that for three to seven days or so.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.420
 Take that wake up time.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.360
 You can then get an average

32:50.280 --> 32:52.580
 or sort of typical temperature minimum.

32:52.580 --> 32:55.640
 Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum.

32:55.640 --> 33:00.640
 Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point

33:00.960 --> 33:03.720
 for shifting your circadian clock,

33:03.720 --> 33:05.380
 whether or not it's for jet lag or shift work

33:05.380 --> 33:07.000
 or some other purpose.

33:07.000 --> 33:07.960
 Here's the deal.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.920
 If you expose your eyes to bright light

33:14.100 --> 33:17.320
 in the four hours, maybe five or six,

33:17.320 --> 33:20.260
 but in the four hours after your temperature minimum,

33:21.580 --> 33:25.500
 your circadian clock will shift

33:25.500 --> 33:27.880
 so that you will tend to get up earlier

33:27.880 --> 33:31.920
 and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay?

33:31.920 --> 33:33.980
 It's what's called a phase advance,

33:33.980 --> 33:35.920
 if you'd like to read up on this further.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.000
 You advance your clock, okay?

33:39.000 --> 33:42.600
 However, if you view bright light

33:42.600 --> 33:45.940
 in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum,

33:47.600 --> 33:50.020
 you will tend to phase delay your clock.

33:50.020 --> 33:54.520
 You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later, okay?

33:54.520 --> 33:56.520
 I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion

33:56.520 --> 33:58.240
 out there and people talk about circadian time

33:58.240 --> 33:59.080
 and all this.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.200
 Find your temperature minimum.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.840
 I tend to wake up at about 6 a.m., sometimes 6.30,

34:03.840 --> 34:04.680
 sometimes seven.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.740
 It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before

34:06.740 --> 34:08.200
 as I'm guessing it does for you.

34:08.200 --> 34:11.160
 But that means that my temperature minimum

34:11.160 --> 34:14.180
 is probably somewhere right around 4.30 a.m.,

34:14.180 --> 34:17.660
 which means that if I wake up at 4.30 a.m.

34:17.660 --> 34:21.960
 and I were to view bright light at 4.35 a.m.,

34:22.860 --> 34:24.400
 I'm going to advance my clock.

34:24.400 --> 34:28.100
 I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night

34:28.100 --> 34:30.300
 and wake up earlier the subsequent morning.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.920
 And as I shift my wake-up time,

34:34.920 --> 34:37.000
 my temperature minimum shifts too, right?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.220
 Because each time we shift our wake-up time,

34:39.220 --> 34:40.920
 our temperature minimum shifts,

34:40.920 --> 34:43.760
 assuming that wake-up time shifts more than, you know,

34:43.760 --> 34:45.880
 30 minutes or an hour, okay?

34:47.200 --> 34:49.940
 If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours

34:49.940 --> 34:53.080
 before 4.30 a.m., guess what?

34:53.080 --> 34:55.400
 The next night I'm going to want to stay up later

34:55.400 --> 34:57.440
 and I'm going to want to wake up later

34:57.440 --> 34:58.600
 the subsequent morning.

34:59.620 --> 35:01.800
 Your temperature minimum is a reference point,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.960
 not a temperature reading.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.520
 Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum

35:06.520 --> 35:08.680
 and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever,

35:08.680 --> 35:10.680
 or 96 point whatever, that's fine.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.240
 You can do that, but that information won't help you.

35:13.240 --> 35:14.960
 What you need to know is what time

35:14.960 --> 35:16.240
 your body temperature is lowest

35:16.240 --> 35:18.880
 and understand that in the four hours or so

35:18.880 --> 35:20.280
 just after that time,

35:20.280 --> 35:22.760
 viewing light will advance your clock

35:22.760 --> 35:24.560
 to make you want to get up earlier.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.040
 And the four hours before your temperature minimum,

35:29.040 --> 35:33.480
 viewing light will make you want to stay up later.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.580
 Now, some people might be saying,

35:34.580 --> 35:36.820
 well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late

35:36.820 --> 35:39.560
 and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess, or I feel fine.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.920
 Look, let's talk about feeling fine.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.820
 It turns out the definition of insomnia

35:45.820 --> 35:49.080
 is when you're experiencing excessive sleepiness

35:49.080 --> 35:49.920
 during the day.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.700
 Sleepiness and fatigue are different, okay?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.420
 So in the world of sleep medicine,

35:54.420 --> 35:57.040
 fatigue is a physical exhaustion.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.640
 Sleepiness is falling asleep,

35:59.640 --> 36:01.640
 like falling asleep at your desk

36:01.640 --> 36:03.000
 or falling asleep during lectures,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.440
 or there seems to be something special about my lectures

36:05.440 --> 36:06.560
 that makes people want to fall asleep.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.440
 So if this cures your insomnia, fantastic.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.180
 However, in all seriousness,

36:12.600 --> 36:15.120
 sleepiness during the daytime,

36:15.120 --> 36:17.280
 unless it's around your temperature peak

36:17.280 --> 36:19.840
 and only lasts about 90 minutes or so,

36:19.840 --> 36:22.100
 is a sign of insomnia.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.640
 It's a sign of lack of sleep.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.360
 I want to be very, very clear

36:28.360 --> 36:31.600
 that if you know your temperature minimum,

36:31.600 --> 36:34.120
 you can shift your clock using light.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.520
 You can also shift your clock

36:36.520 --> 36:39.200
 by engaging in exercise in the four hours

36:39.200 --> 36:40.320
 after your temperature minimum

36:40.320 --> 36:43.120
 to wake up earlier on subsequent nights

36:43.120 --> 36:46.400
 or exercise before then to delay your clock, okay?

36:46.400 --> 36:48.880
 So now you can start to see and understand

36:48.880 --> 36:51.360
 the logic of this system.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.040
 And we'll talk about why this works

36:53.040 --> 36:54.240
 and the underlying biology,

36:54.240 --> 36:58.160
 but understanding that temperature is the effector

36:58.160 --> 37:00.760
 and understanding that you have this low point

37:00.760 --> 37:03.580
 that reflects your most sleepy point, essentially,

37:03.580 --> 37:07.520
 right before waking up, and then temperature rises,

37:07.520 --> 37:09.480
 you can now start to shift that temperature

37:09.480 --> 37:12.200
 according to your travel needs.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.680
 Here's one way in which you might do that.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.800
 Let's say I am going to travel to Europe,

37:16.800 --> 37:21.480
 which is nine hours ahead, typically, from California.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.480
 I would want to determine my temperature minimum,

37:24.480 --> 37:27.600
 which for me is about 4.30 a.m., maybe 5 a.m.,

37:27.600 --> 37:32.600
 and I would want to start getting up at about 5.30 a.m.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.120
 and getting some bright light exposure,

37:36.120 --> 37:37.600
 presumably from artificial sources,

37:37.600 --> 37:41.220
 because the sunlight isn't going to be out at that time,

37:41.220 --> 37:42.640
 maybe even exercising as well,

37:42.640 --> 37:45.200
 maybe even eating a meal at that time

37:45.200 --> 37:47.080
 if that's in your practice.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.720
 You would want to start doing that

37:49.720 --> 37:51.460
 two or three days before travel,

37:53.240 --> 37:58.000
 because once you land in, or I land in Europe,

37:59.120 --> 38:02.640
 chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in Europe

38:02.640 --> 38:05.420
 is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.560
 Some people say, get sunlight in your eyes when you land,

38:07.560 --> 38:09.760
 but that's not going to work,

38:09.760 --> 38:13.040
 because one of two things is likely to happen.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.440
 With a nine-hour shift like that,

38:14.440 --> 38:16.360
 either I'm going to view sunlight

38:16.360 --> 38:19.080
 at a time that corresponds to the circadian dead zone,

38:19.080 --> 38:22.500
 the time in which my circadian clock can't be shifted,

38:22.500 --> 38:25.420
 or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight at a time

38:25.420 --> 38:28.660
 that corresponds to the four to six-hour window

38:29.840 --> 38:32.660
 before my temperature minimum.

38:32.660 --> 38:33.520
 So it's going to shift me

38:33.520 --> 38:37.160
 in exactly the opposite direction that I want to go.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.820
 So it can be very, very challenging

38:39.820 --> 38:41.920
 for people to adjust to jet lag.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.240
 So you need to ask, am I traveling east

38:44.240 --> 38:45.120
 or am I traveling west?

38:45.120 --> 38:47.960
 Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock?

38:47.960 --> 38:51.780
 Remember, viewing light, exercise, and eating

38:51.780 --> 38:54.080
 in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum

38:54.080 --> 38:55.120
 will delay your clock.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.240
 Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising,

38:58.240 --> 38:59.280
 you don't have to do all three,

38:59.280 --> 39:01.920
 but some combination of those in the four to six hours

39:01.920 --> 39:05.040
 after your temperature minimum will advance your clock.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.680
 And this is a powerful mechanism

39:06.680 --> 39:08.680
 by which you can shift your clock anywhere

39:08.680 --> 39:13.160
 from one to three hours per day, which is remarkable.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.200
 That means your temperature minimum is going to shift out

39:15.200 --> 39:18.660
 as much as three hours, which can make it such

39:18.660 --> 39:21.800
 that you can travel all the way to Europe.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.920
 And as long as you've prepared for a day or so

39:24.920 --> 39:27.800
 by doing what I described back home,

39:27.800 --> 39:30.160
 and then doing it when you arrive,

39:30.160 --> 39:32.400
 you can potentially accomplish the entire shift

39:32.400 --> 39:36.160
 within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours.

39:36.160 --> 39:40.080
 And this is really important to emphasize

39:40.080 --> 39:42.600
 that once you arrive in your new location,

39:42.600 --> 39:44.040
 and here I'm talking about traveling eastward,

39:44.040 --> 39:47.360
 California to Europe, once you arrive in your new location,

39:48.720 --> 39:51.120
 you have to keep track of what your temperature minimum

39:51.120 --> 39:54.480
 was back home and how it's being shifted during your trip.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.680
 Now, it's much easier to do than you think.

39:56.680 --> 40:01.160
 One of the unfortunate consequences of the smartphone

40:01.160 --> 40:04.400
 is that you can't do something goofy

40:04.400 --> 40:05.400
 like wearing two watches,

40:05.400 --> 40:07.440
 one watch that corresponds to the time back home

40:07.440 --> 40:10.080
 and another one that corresponds to the local time.

40:10.080 --> 40:15.080
 Typically it updates automatically based on wifi, et cetera.

40:15.280 --> 40:19.280
 But if you can keep track of the time back home,

40:19.280 --> 40:22.520
 then you can easily shift your clock going forward.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.120
 I'm hoping this makes sense.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.400
 I really want to emphasize that you don't have to be precise

40:27.400 --> 40:28.600
 down to the minute.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.120
 Some of you may be asking, well, what about, you know,

40:31.120 --> 40:32.380
 you've got this temperature minimum,

40:32.380 --> 40:34.440
 and if I view light one minute before it,

40:34.440 --> 40:35.620
 then I'm going to delay my clock,

40:35.620 --> 40:37.600
 and one minute after it, I'm going to advance my clock.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.200
 It doesn't quite work like that, okay?

40:40.200 --> 40:42.760
 But it's very important to understand

40:42.760 --> 40:44.120
 that light is the primary way

40:44.120 --> 40:46.340
 in which we can shift our clock.

40:46.340 --> 40:49.400
 And now you should also be able to understand things

40:49.400 --> 40:53.880
 like the circadian dead zone from about 9.30, 10 a.m.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.760
 all the way until six hours

40:56.760 --> 40:58.780
 before your temperature minimum.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.240
 You're not going to shift your clock.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.520
 Nothing that you do in that time

41:01.520 --> 41:04.720
 in terms of light viewing behavior, feeding, et cetera,

41:04.720 --> 41:06.160
 is going to shift your clock.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.280
 And so a lot of people are landing in Europe,

41:08.280 --> 41:10.240
 getting sunlight in their eyes,

41:10.240 --> 41:12.820
 and throwing their clock out of whack,

41:12.820 --> 41:15.120
 or not shifting their clock at all.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.360
 This brings me to the other thing that's highly recommended,

41:18.360 --> 41:19.400
 and I've mentioned this before,

41:19.400 --> 41:21.780
 but you want to eat on the local meal schedule.

41:21.780 --> 41:26.240
 If it's in your practice to fast, fast, that's fine.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.240
 But when you eat, you want to eat

41:28.240 --> 41:31.560
 within the local schedule for alertness.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.940
 Okay, that means if you arrive

41:34.940 --> 41:35.920
 and everyone's eating breakfast

41:35.920 --> 41:38.280
 and you can't stomach the idea of breakfast

41:38.280 --> 41:40.100
 in your new location because your appetite isn't there,

41:40.100 --> 41:41.640
 that means the clock in your liver,

41:41.640 --> 41:44.480
 you have a clock in your liver, biological clock,

41:44.480 --> 41:46.700
 has not caught up to the new time zone.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.220
 You can force yourself to eat if you like,

41:51.220 --> 41:53.200
 or you can skip that meal,

41:53.200 --> 41:54.720
 but what you don't want to do

41:54.720 --> 41:57.440
 is stay on your home meal schedule,

41:57.440 --> 41:58.840
 waking up in the middle of the night and eating.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.400
 That is really going to throw things off

42:00.400 --> 42:02.600
 because a lot of the clocks in the periphery,

42:02.600 --> 42:04.640
 like from the liver, the peripheral body,

42:04.640 --> 42:06.680
 will send information back to the brain,

42:06.680 --> 42:09.380
 and then the brain is getting really conflicted signals.

42:09.380 --> 42:12.240
 So the temperature minimum is really your anchor point

42:12.240 --> 42:14.200
 for shifting your clock best.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.260
 I don't know why this information

42:15.260 --> 42:19.160
 really hasn't made it into the popular sphere quite so much.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.280
 There's all sorts of stuff

42:20.280 --> 42:23.800
 about taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats,

42:23.800 --> 42:28.200
 a lot of kind of like more sophisticated, complicated,

42:28.200 --> 42:32.640
 and potentially problematic ways of trying to shift the clock.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.340
 Let's talk about melatonin,

42:34.340 --> 42:35.880
 but first I just want to pause

42:35.880 --> 42:38.920
 and shift gears a little bit

42:38.920 --> 42:41.600
 because I talked about traveling eastward,

42:41.600 --> 42:43.960
 but we haven't talked about traveling westward.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.360
 So I want to do that now.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.660
 Let's say you're traveling from New York to California

42:47.660 --> 42:49.800
 or from Europe to California.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.240
 The challenge there tends to be

42:52.240 --> 42:54.220
 how can you stay up late enough?

42:54.220 --> 42:56.260
 Now, some people are able to do this

42:56.260 --> 42:57.680
 because as I mentioned earlier,

42:57.680 --> 43:00.800
 the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired

43:00.800 --> 43:03.540
 such that it's easier to stay up late later

43:03.540 --> 43:05.200
 than we would naturally want to

43:05.200 --> 43:06.700
 than it is to go to sleep earlier.

43:06.700 --> 43:11.400
 So let's say you land and it's 4 p.m. and you're just dying.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.640
 You're in California, you came from Europe, it's 4 p.m.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.520
 and you really, really want to go to sleep.

43:16.520 --> 43:19.940
 That's where the use of things like caffeine, exercise,

43:19.940 --> 43:22.440
 and sunlight can shift you, right?

43:22.440 --> 43:24.720
 If it's after your temperature peak,

43:24.720 --> 43:27.680
 then viewing sunlight around 6 p.m. or 8 p.m.

43:27.680 --> 43:31.160
 or artificial light, if there's in sunlight,

43:31.160 --> 43:33.500
 will help shift you later, right?

43:33.500 --> 43:35.120
 It's going to delay your clock

43:35.120 --> 43:37.240
 and you're going to be able to stay up later.

43:38.420 --> 43:40.140
 The worst thing you can do is take a nap

43:40.140 --> 43:43.120
 that was intended to last 20 minutes or an hour.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.080
 I do this routinely and then wake up four hours later

43:46.080 --> 43:48.280
 or you wake up and it's midnight

43:48.280 --> 43:49.480
 and you can't fall back asleep.

43:49.480 --> 43:52.040
 You really want to avoid doing that.

43:52.040 --> 43:55.120
 So provided it's not excessive amounts,

43:55.120 --> 43:57.720
 stimulants like caffeine and coffee or tea

43:57.720 --> 44:00.920
 can really help you push past that afternoon barrier

44:00.920 --> 44:05.040
 and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule

44:05.040 --> 44:07.920
 and eating on the local schedule as well.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.600
 A number of people have asked

44:10.600 --> 44:13.880
 about the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.740
 All right, well, let's think about what melatonin is.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.440
 Melatonin is this hormone that's released

44:18.440 --> 44:21.280
 from the pineal gland, which is this gland.

44:21.280 --> 44:23.040
 A couple of notes about the pineal

44:23.040 --> 44:25.120
 because I've been getting a lot of questions about this.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.640
 I'm probably going to draw some fire for this,

44:26.640 --> 44:31.640
 but I'd be happy to have a thoughtful, considerate debate

44:31.680 --> 44:34.780
 with some peer reviewed papers in front of us.

44:34.780 --> 44:37.840
 The pineal does make this hallucinogenic molecule

44:37.840 --> 44:41.160
 they call DMT, but in such minuscule amounts

44:41.160 --> 44:44.120
 that it is not responsible for the hallucinations you see

44:44.120 --> 44:45.220
 in sleep and dreaming.

44:45.220 --> 44:46.100
 Sorry, folks.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.000
 It's also not responsible for the hallucinations

44:48.000 --> 44:51.120
 you might see through other approaches to DMT.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.680
 It's just not, that's not where the DMT comes from.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.440
 It's infinitesimally small amounts.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.940
 There are a lot of kind of wacky claims out there

44:59.940 --> 45:03.400
 about calcification of the pineal and fluoride

45:03.400 --> 45:04.560
 and this kind of thing.

45:05.640 --> 45:10.640
 Look, the pineal sits in an area of the brain

45:10.680 --> 45:14.320
 near the fourth ventricle where the skull

45:14.320 --> 45:16.280
 is not terribly far away,

45:16.280 --> 45:18.620
 although there's some overlapping neural tissue.

45:18.620 --> 45:22.160
 And with age, there's some aggregation

45:22.160 --> 45:24.980
 of some of the meninges and other things around there

45:24.980 --> 45:26.280
 that stick to the skull.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.860
 Young brains don't look like old brains,

45:27.860 --> 45:30.880
 but there's no calcification of the pineal, all right?

45:30.880 --> 45:33.080
 So you can forget about calcification

45:33.080 --> 45:35.160
 of the pineal is a problem.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.920
 I don't know where that whole thing got started,

45:36.920 --> 45:39.000
 but that's not an issue.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.220
 Your pineal will churn out melatonin my whole life.

45:43.220 --> 45:45.660
 Melatonin induces sleepiness.

45:45.660 --> 45:49.600
 Melatonin during development is also responsible

45:49.600 --> 45:52.300
 for timing the secretion of certain hormones

45:52.300 --> 45:55.220
 that are vitally important for puberty.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.900
 Does melatonin control the onset of puberty?

45:58.900 --> 46:01.480
 Not directly, but indirectly.

46:01.480 --> 46:03.320
 Melatonin inhibits something

46:03.320 --> 46:05.180
 called the gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

46:05.180 --> 46:07.340
 which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus,

46:07.340 --> 46:10.120
 also roughly above the roof of your mouth and your brain.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.960
 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting

46:11.960 --> 46:14.320
 because it stimulates the release of another hormone

46:14.320 --> 46:15.800
 called luteinizing hormone,

46:15.800 --> 46:19.560
 which in females causes estrogen

46:19.560 --> 46:22.520
 to be released within the ovaries,

46:22.520 --> 46:24.260
 it's involved in reproductive cycles,

46:24.260 --> 46:27.320
 and in males stimulates testosterone

46:27.320 --> 46:30.400
 from the sertoli cells of the testes.

46:31.660 --> 46:34.640
 Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH,

46:34.640 --> 46:35.920
 gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

46:35.920 --> 46:38.600
 and therefore is inhibitory to LH, luteinizing hormone,

46:38.600 --> 46:41.560
 and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and estrogen.

46:41.560 --> 46:43.200
 There's just no two ways about it.

46:43.200 --> 46:48.200
 There is an immense amount of data

46:49.080 --> 46:51.820
 on the fact that high levels of melatonin

46:51.820 --> 46:54.360
 in seasonally breeding animals

46:54.360 --> 46:57.000
 takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries

46:57.000 --> 47:00.140
 that are capable of deploying eggs and this kind of thing,

47:00.140 --> 47:02.040
 and literally shrinking them

47:02.040 --> 47:04.360
 and making these animals infertile.

47:04.360 --> 47:05.760
 These are very high levels of melatonin

47:05.760 --> 47:07.360
 in seasonal breeders in winter.

47:08.200 --> 47:11.520
 Melatonin in males of seasonal breeders

47:11.520 --> 47:13.880
 takes the testes and shrinks them.

47:13.880 --> 47:17.720
 Long ago when I was at UC Berkeley as a master's student,

47:17.720 --> 47:19.840
 I was working on neuroendocrinology,

47:19.840 --> 47:22.560
 and we were working on this hamster species

47:22.560 --> 47:23.500
 of seasonal breeders,

47:23.500 --> 47:27.480
 and basically when days are long, which inhibits melatonin,

47:27.480 --> 47:30.720
 these little Siberian hamsters, as they're called,

47:30.720 --> 47:34.720
 have testes about the size of sort of typical table grapes,

47:34.720 --> 47:36.620
 although that's a weird way to put it.

47:37.860 --> 47:41.000
 When days get shorter and the melatonin signal gets longer,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.360
 because light inhibits melatonin,

47:42.360 --> 47:43.920
 days get shorter, melatonin gets longer,

47:43.920 --> 47:46.680
 those same hamsters would have testes

47:46.680 --> 47:49.440
 that would involute to the size of about a grain of rice.

47:49.440 --> 47:53.780
 Now, this does not happen in humans in short days,

47:53.780 --> 47:56.240
 but nonetheless, the melatonin signal

47:56.240 --> 47:59.100
 really does have a ton of effects on the hormone system.

47:59.100 --> 48:02.120
 Now, does that mean that if you've been taking melatonin,

48:02.120 --> 48:03.220
 you've really screwed up your hormones?

48:03.220 --> 48:04.060
 Not necessarily.

48:04.060 --> 48:05.760
 Does it mean if a kid has been taking melatonin,

48:05.760 --> 48:07.320
 that's really screwing up their puberty?

48:07.320 --> 48:11.880
 Not necessarily, and here's why.

48:11.880 --> 48:15.600
 Melatonin operates on a concentration level,

48:15.600 --> 48:18.640
 so in a child that's very, very small,

48:19.500 --> 48:21.200
 that has high levels of melatonin,

48:21.200 --> 48:25.360
 it actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone, or estrogen,

48:25.360 --> 48:27.960
 depending on the sex of the child.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.320
 But as that child grows through other mechanisms,

48:30.320 --> 48:32.060
 like growth hormone release, et cetera,

48:32.060 --> 48:34.400
 that same amount of melatonin released from the pineal

48:34.400 --> 48:36.680
 is now diluted over a much larger body,

48:36.680 --> 48:40.820
 so the concentration actually goes way, way down, okay?

48:40.820 --> 48:43.200
 But here's the problem with supplementing melatonin.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.220
 As I mentioned in the previous episode,

48:45.220 --> 48:48.280
 concentrations of melatonin in many commercial supplements

48:48.280 --> 48:52.420
 have been shown to be anywhere from 85% to 400%

48:52.420 --> 48:54.480
 of what's listed on the bottle.

48:54.480 --> 48:57.280
 So when you take melatonin, or a child takes melatonin,

48:57.280 --> 48:58.400
 oftentimes they are taking

48:58.400 --> 49:01.840
 supra physiological levels of melatonin,

49:01.840 --> 49:06.500
 which at least by my read and the literature,

49:06.500 --> 49:08.760
 says that it could have dramatic effects

49:08.760 --> 49:12.640
 on timing and course of things like puberty.

49:12.640 --> 49:16.160
 So it's not so much that the journals have come out saying,

49:16.160 --> 49:19.500
 oh, taking that melatonin inhibits puberty,

49:19.500 --> 49:21.280
 it's that no single study has been done

49:21.280 --> 49:23.780
 with the supra physiological levels of melatonin

49:23.780 --> 49:26.120
 that are present in a lot of these supplements

49:26.120 --> 49:29.040
 in developing children.

49:29.040 --> 49:33.720
 So melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness

49:33.720 --> 49:34.840
 when you want to fall asleep

49:34.840 --> 49:37.240
 in the new location that you've arrived, right?

49:37.240 --> 49:38.080
 You can't fall asleep,

49:38.080 --> 49:40.480
 you take melatonin, it helps you fall asleep.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.920
 It does not help you stay asleep.

49:42.920 --> 49:46.760
 In addition to that, melatonin has been kind of touted

49:46.760 --> 49:49.480
 as the best way to shift your circadian clock.

49:49.480 --> 49:51.240
 I'm happy to go on record saying,

49:51.240 --> 49:53.400
 look, if you need melatonin and you can work with a doctor

49:53.400 --> 49:55.060
 or somebody who really understands circadian

49:55.060 --> 49:57.920
 and sleep biology, go for it if that's your thing.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.720
 But I, as always on this podcast and elsewhere,

50:01.720 --> 50:05.680
 I have a bias toward behavioral things

50:05.680 --> 50:06.960
 that you can titrate and control,

50:06.960 --> 50:09.880
 like exposure to light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,

50:09.880 --> 50:12.680
 that have much bigger margins for safety

50:12.680 --> 50:14.680
 and certainly don't have these other endocrine effects

50:14.680 --> 50:17.380
 that we've been thinking about and talking about.

50:17.380 --> 50:20.680
 So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon

50:20.680 --> 50:23.620
 in order to fall asleep or in the evening, be my guest,

50:23.620 --> 50:24.840
 that's up to you.

50:24.840 --> 50:27.720
 Again, you're responsible for your health, not me.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.640
 But for many people,

50:29.640 --> 50:32.280
 melatonin is not going to be the best solution.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.160
 The best solution is going to be to use light

50:35.160 --> 50:36.920
 and temperature and exercise

50:36.920 --> 50:39.180
 on either side of the temperature minimum

50:39.180 --> 50:41.040
 to shift your clock both before your trip

50:41.040 --> 50:42.760
 and when you land in your new location

50:42.760 --> 50:44.640
 and your clock starts to shift.

50:44.640 --> 50:47.920
 Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.960
 Feel free to filter them through your own opinions

50:50.960 --> 50:53.320
 and experiences with melatonin.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.880
 And now you also understand what your temperature minimum is

50:56.880 --> 50:59.560
 and how it represents an important landmark,

50:59.560 --> 51:02.960
 either side of which you can use light temperature

51:02.960 --> 51:05.480
 and exercise to shift your clock.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.120
 Just to remind you a little bit about temperature,

51:07.120 --> 51:09.840
 if you want to shift your clock,

51:09.840 --> 51:12.040
 typically you would do that by,

51:12.040 --> 51:13.120
 you could take a hot shower

51:13.120 --> 51:15.200
 and then that will have a cooling effect

51:15.200 --> 51:16.560
 after the hot shower.

51:17.640 --> 51:20.840
 And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath,

51:20.840 --> 51:22.220
 if you have access to one,

51:22.220 --> 51:24.520
 afterward there's going to be a thermogenic effect

51:24.520 --> 51:26.720
 of your body increasing temperature.

51:26.720 --> 51:29.480
 And if you just think about your natural rhythm

51:29.480 --> 51:31.300
 back home when everything's stable,

51:32.360 --> 51:35.520
 you have a nadir, a low point in,

51:35.520 --> 51:36.620
 which is your temperature minimum,

51:36.620 --> 51:38.840
 and then you have a peak and you think about

51:38.840 --> 51:42.580
 when you're doing this hot or cold shower in that rhythm,

51:42.580 --> 51:44.000
 now you should be able to understand

51:44.000 --> 51:45.720
 how you're shifting your rhythm.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.040
 That temperature rhythm is the one that's going to move.

51:48.040 --> 51:49.440
 Give you an example.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.740
 If I were to wake up in the morning

51:51.740 --> 51:54.440
 and let's say I wake up at 6 a.m.,

51:54.440 --> 51:55.960
 my temperature I know is rising,

51:55.960 --> 51:57.640
 I've passed my temperature minimum.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.160
 If I were to get into a hot shower

52:01.280 --> 52:04.420
 that would then lower my body temperature when I got out,

52:04.420 --> 52:06.400
 that is not normally what's happening

52:06.400 --> 52:08.220
 first thing in the morning.

52:08.220 --> 52:10.480
 And therefore, my clock would very likely

52:10.480 --> 52:12.440
 get phase delayed, right?

52:12.440 --> 52:15.120
 It's going to delay the increase in temperature.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.360
 Whereas if I got into a cold shower,

52:17.360 --> 52:18.640
 something I don't personally like to do,

52:18.640 --> 52:20.800
 but I've done from time to time,

52:20.800 --> 52:22.440
 or an ice bath, that's going to then

52:22.440 --> 52:24.880
 have a rebound increase in body temperature

52:24.880 --> 52:26.700
 and is going to phase advance my clock.

52:26.700 --> 52:28.880
 That peak in the afternoon is going to come

52:28.880 --> 52:30.380
 about an hour earlier.

52:30.380 --> 52:33.000
 I'm going to want to go to bed earlier later that night.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.940
 So you can start to play these games with timing

52:34.940 --> 52:37.080
 and hot and cold, with meals,

52:37.080 --> 52:38.920
 whether or not you eat or you don't eat,

52:38.920 --> 52:40.140
 and with light exposure,

52:40.140 --> 52:42.620
 whether or not you view light or you don't view light.

52:42.620 --> 52:44.600
 So now you can start to see why understanding

52:44.600 --> 52:46.680
 the core mechanics of a system

52:46.680 --> 52:48.400
 can really give you the most flexibility

52:48.400 --> 52:53.200
 because I could spend the next 25 years of my life

52:53.200 --> 52:56.240
 answering every question about every nuanced pattern

52:56.240 --> 52:58.000
 of travel, well, we're going to Sydney,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.600
 then we're going there, what should I do?

52:59.600 --> 53:00.760
 But that's on you.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.920
 You need to figure out your temperature minimum

53:02.920 --> 53:04.700
 and your temperature peak, if you like,

53:04.700 --> 53:07.440
 and then use these parameters to, it gives you flexibility.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.480
 And that really underscores the most important thing

53:09.480 --> 53:10.920
 is that when you understand mechanism,

53:10.920 --> 53:13.640
 it's not about being neurotically attached

53:13.640 --> 53:15.800
 to a specific protocol, it's the opposite.

53:15.800 --> 53:18.600
 It gives you power to not be neurotically attached

53:18.600 --> 53:20.000
 to a specific protocol.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.660
 It can give you great confidence and flexibility

53:22.660 --> 53:24.760
 in being able to shift your body rhythms however you want.

53:24.760 --> 53:25.720
 And when things get out of whack,

53:25.720 --> 53:27.760
 you can tuck them right back into place.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.680
 One thing that's common

53:30.680 --> 53:32.640
 is that people need to do a quick trip.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.440
 It's not always that you're going to go to,

53:34.440 --> 53:35.760
 you know, on vacation for two weeks

53:35.760 --> 53:40.080
 or, you know, work someplace else for weeks on end.

53:41.340 --> 53:46.340
 If your trip is 48 hours or less, stay on your home schedule.

53:46.560 --> 53:50.100
 This can be tough and it may require scheduling meetings

53:50.100 --> 53:52.240
 according to your home schedule.

53:52.240 --> 53:55.420
 But if you can somehow manage that,

53:55.420 --> 53:58.020
 the best thing to do would be to stay on your home schedule.

53:58.020 --> 54:01.460
 Your clock is not going to shift more than a couple hours,

54:01.460 --> 54:06.060
 even if you do everything correctly in one day, okay?

54:06.060 --> 54:09.200
 So if I were to travel, say to Europe,

54:09.200 --> 54:10.080
 I've actually done this.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.280
 I did a 24 hour trip to Basel, Switzerland,

54:12.280 --> 54:13.460
 gave a talk and came back.

54:13.460 --> 54:14.420
 People thought I was crazy,

54:14.420 --> 54:16.840
 but I had a little bit of travel fatigue

54:16.840 --> 54:17.820
 because remember there's fatigue

54:17.820 --> 54:19.800
 from the actual travel experience.

54:19.800 --> 54:23.680
 The novelty of it, the air is never great on the planes.

54:23.680 --> 54:25.880
 This was even true before there were mask requirements

54:25.880 --> 54:27.080
 and things like that.

54:27.080 --> 54:28.240
 So there's the travel fatigue,

54:28.240 --> 54:30.680
 but you don't throw your clock off.

54:30.680 --> 54:35.680
 If you stay 48 hours, then you start to shift a little bit.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.840
 72, that's when you start running into trouble.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.160
 The transit time is also important,

54:41.160 --> 54:43.600
 but I would say if it's three days or less,

54:43.600 --> 54:46.800
 stay on your home schedule as much as you can.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.920
 And because sunlight isn't under your control,

54:49.920 --> 54:51.960
 unless there's something about you I don't know,

54:51.960 --> 54:54.580
 that's when traveling with some sort of bright light,

54:54.580 --> 54:56.960
 like the light pad that I have down there

54:56.960 --> 54:58.720
 that I showed earlier.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.080
 For those of you listening just on audio,

55:00.080 --> 55:03.320
 it's just, it looks like an eight and a half by 11 pad.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.840
 It's actually not designed for wake up.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.720
 It's actually designed, it's a drawing pad

55:06.720 --> 55:11.720
 and you can, and it emits about a thousand lux of light.

55:12.140 --> 55:15.080
 And so if you want to travel with something like that,

55:15.080 --> 55:16.800
 you can use that in your hotel room

55:16.800 --> 55:19.260
 to wake up when you like.

55:19.260 --> 55:22.240
 Some people will use nightshades,

55:23.340 --> 55:24.640
 not the nightshades that you eat

55:24.640 --> 55:26.000
 or that some people say you're not supposed to eat,

55:26.000 --> 55:27.060
 I don't know anything about that,

55:27.060 --> 55:32.080
 but the eye covers to keep light out.

55:32.080 --> 55:36.480
 Those can be very useful on planes and in hotels and so on.

55:36.480 --> 55:38.600
 So you can use light and dark

55:38.600 --> 55:42.320
 and you can travel with your light and dark devices

55:42.320 --> 55:44.240
 so that you can stay on your home schedule

55:44.240 --> 55:45.260
 and get most of your light

55:45.260 --> 55:48.680
 when it would be your normal wake up time back home.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.420
 And what's kind of nice

55:50.420 --> 55:53.340
 is if you know when your circadian dead zone is back home,

55:53.340 --> 55:55.320
 which is generally for most people

55:55.320 --> 55:59.620
 around 10 AM to about 3 PM.

55:59.620 --> 56:02.920
 So basically the rising phase of your temperature,

56:02.920 --> 56:06.640
 then you can also feel free to be outside

56:06.640 --> 56:07.960
 without having to wear sunglasses

56:07.960 --> 56:09.880
 or you don't have to worry about light exposure.

56:09.880 --> 56:13.120
 But if you know that window

56:13.120 --> 56:14.480
 before your temperature minimum,

56:14.480 --> 56:15.920
 that four to six hour window,

56:15.920 --> 56:17.960
 that's the time when if you're viewing a lot of light

56:17.960 --> 56:19.480
 in your new location,

56:19.480 --> 56:21.960
 you are going to shift your clock pretty considerably.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.680
 And then you can come back home and have a terrible time.

56:24.680 --> 56:25.840
 At the end of graduate school,

56:25.840 --> 56:28.720
 I went to Australia, the remarkable country,

56:28.720 --> 56:30.760
 incredible people, incredible wildlife,

56:30.760 --> 56:31.680
 an amazing time.

56:31.680 --> 56:34.200
 I came back and it was the first time in my life

56:34.200 --> 56:36.500
 where I couldn't sleep on a regular schedule.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.660
 I was sleeping in like hour long increments

56:38.660 --> 56:39.500
 throughout the day.

56:39.500 --> 56:40.860
 It was a nightmare.

56:40.860 --> 56:44.440
 And it took me weeks to get back on target.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.140
 And the way I was able to do that

56:46.140 --> 56:50.580
 was exercising consistently at the same time every 24 hours,

56:50.580 --> 56:54.760
 turning my home into essentially a cave at night,

56:54.760 --> 56:56.400
 even covering up the windows,

56:56.400 --> 56:58.480
 and then getting as much bright light in my eyes

56:58.480 --> 57:00.140
 as I possibly could during the day,

57:00.140 --> 57:01.960
 no sunglasses, et cetera.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.200
 So it can take some real work

57:03.200 --> 57:05.520
 if your clock gets thrown out of whack.

57:05.520 --> 57:08.600
 There's a phenomenon called ICU psychosis,

57:08.600 --> 57:11.080
 where people that are in the intensive care unit

57:11.080 --> 57:13.440
 in hospitals actually lose their mind.

57:13.440 --> 57:18.000
 They become psychotic, hallucinations, et cetera.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.240
 And it's because of altered circadian cycles.

57:21.240 --> 57:23.960
 We know this because they're exposed to these lights

57:23.960 --> 57:26.000
 and these sounds, people coming in and checking on them.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.120
 They leave the hospital,

57:27.120 --> 57:28.840
 or in some cases there've been experiments

57:28.840 --> 57:30.120
 where people are placed near a window

57:30.120 --> 57:31.320
 where they get some natural light,

57:31.320 --> 57:33.760
 and these psychotic symptoms disappear,

57:33.760 --> 57:37.200
 presuming there weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,

57:37.200 --> 57:38.760
 before they entered the hospital.

57:38.760 --> 57:42.720
 So it's pretty dramatic what light can do

57:42.720 --> 57:44.840
 to the psyche and to the body.

57:44.840 --> 57:47.440
 So let's talk a little bit

57:47.440 --> 57:49.160
 about a different form of jet lag

57:49.160 --> 57:52.920
 that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles,

57:52.920 --> 57:54.420
 and that's shift work.

57:55.400 --> 57:58.180
 Shift work is becoming increasingly common.

57:59.280 --> 58:00.680
 Many of us are shift working,

58:00.680 --> 58:02.040
 even though we don't have to.

58:02.040 --> 58:03.920
 We're doing work in the middle of the night.

58:03.920 --> 58:08.200
 We are working on our computers at odd hours,

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
 sleeping during the day.

58:09.200 --> 58:13.440
 A lot of people who are under shelter in place type stuff

58:13.440 --> 58:15.120
 are doing more of this.

58:15.120 --> 58:18.040
 Kids with the drifting school schedules.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.760
 Here's the deal with shift work.

58:19.760 --> 58:22.640
 If there's one rule of thumb for shift work,

58:22.640 --> 58:25.840
 it's that if at all possible,

58:25.840 --> 58:29.820
 you want to stay on the same schedule for at least 14 days,

58:29.820 --> 58:31.640
 including weekends.

58:31.640 --> 58:34.920
 Now that should immediately cue the non-shift workers

58:34.920 --> 58:37.620
 to the importance of not getting too far off track

58:37.620 --> 58:39.360
 on the weekend, even if you're not a shift worker.

58:39.360 --> 58:43.000
 So sleeping in on Sunday is not a good idea.

58:44.700 --> 58:46.440
 The most important thing about shift work

58:46.440 --> 58:49.120
 is to stay consistent with your schedule.

58:49.120 --> 58:52.040
 Now I had a conversation on an Instagram Live

58:52.040 --> 58:53.720
 with Samir Hattar,

58:53.720 --> 58:55.980
 who's a neuroscientist

58:55.980 --> 58:57.560
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.640
 He's actually the head of the chronobiology unit there.

58:59.640 --> 59:02.200
 And he was really emphasizing this point

59:02.200 --> 59:03.580
 because shift work,

59:03.580 --> 59:05.340
 where people are doing the so-called swing shift,

59:05.340 --> 59:07.000
 where they're working four days on one shift

59:07.000 --> 59:08.600
 and four days on another,

59:08.600 --> 59:11.540
 is extremely detrimental to a number of health parameters.

59:11.540 --> 59:14.880
 It gets the cortisol release from the adrenals

59:14.880 --> 59:16.360
 really out of whack.

59:16.360 --> 59:18.440
 And there are these cortisol spikes

59:18.440 --> 59:20.160
 at various hours of the day.

59:20.160 --> 59:21.520
 It messes up learning.

59:21.520 --> 59:24.640
 It really disrupts the dopamine system and wellbeing.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.560
 It is a serious, serious problem.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.600
 So if you can negotiate with your employer

59:30.540 --> 59:34.200
 to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time,

59:34.200 --> 59:35.800
 that's going to be immensely beneficial

59:35.800 --> 59:37.920
 and will help you offset a lot of the negative effects

59:37.920 --> 59:38.760
 of shift work.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.680
 Now, I don't presume that all of you

59:41.680 --> 59:43.240
 are going to be able to do that.

59:43.240 --> 59:46.400
 Some of you just don't have that level of control.

59:46.400 --> 59:47.240
 And of course,

59:47.240 --> 59:50.380
 I want to acknowledge that shift workers are essential.

59:51.520 --> 59:54.360
 Of course, first responders, firefighters, police officers,

59:54.360 --> 59:55.700
 paramedics, et cetera,

59:55.700 --> 59:58.680
 but also pilots, nurses,

59:58.680 --> 1:00:02.560
 people working on the hospital wards,

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.160
 people picking up trash.

1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:06.120
 These night shifts are critical

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:07.880
 to our functioning as a society,

1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:09.860
 as I'm sure all of you can appreciate.

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:13.360
 If you're going to work a shift

1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:15.760
 where let's say you start at 4 p.m.

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:19.200
 and you end at 2 a.m., excuse me,

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:21.860
 then there's some important questions that arise.

1:00:21.860 --> 1:00:26.280
 For instance, should you see light during your shift?

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:29.600
 Well, this is a matter of personal choice,

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.280
 but ideally you want to view as much light as possible

1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:35.240
 and as safely possible when you need to be alert.

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:38.120
 So that would mean from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.200
 And then you would want to sleep.

1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:45.900
 So using light as a correlate of alertness

1:00:45.900 --> 1:00:48.920
 and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness,

1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:51.480
 what this means is see as much light as you safely can

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:55.100
 during the phase of your day when you want to be awake.

1:00:55.100 --> 1:00:56.320
 So it's the same thing I said way back

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:59.520
 to the beginning of this podcast episode.

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:02.800
 And see as little light as safely possible

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.960
 and allows you to function during the time

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:06.320
 when you want to be asleep.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:08.860
 So if you're finishing out that 2 a.m. shift,

1:01:08.860 --> 1:01:12.760
 that's when you would want to avoid bright light exposure,

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:13.880
 you'd want to go home,

1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:16.600
 you'd really want to avoid watching TV if possible.

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:18.200
 If you need that in order to fall asleep,

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:21.720
 that would be a case where something like dimming the screen

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:24.980
 plus blue blockers, if that's in your practice,

1:01:26.060 --> 1:01:27.780
 or you want to do that would be helpful

1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:28.680
 and then going to sleep.

1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:31.640
 And then you'll probably wake up late in the afternoon

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.040
 or early afternoon.

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:34.960
 Some of you might say, wait, Huberman,

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.100
 I thought you don't like blue blockers.

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:37.440
 I never said I don't like blue blockers.

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.840
 I don't like people wearing blue blockers

1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:40.520
 at the time of day when they want to be alert.

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:43.200
 And I don't like people asserting that blue blockers

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:45.040
 can prevent circadian shifts

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:46.380
 simply because people are wearing them.

1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:48.000
 The brightness of light is what's important.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.700
 It's not about the blue.

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:53.520
 So if you want to wear them, wear them,

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:56.180
 or just dim the lights or turn the lights off.

1:01:56.180 --> 1:01:59.160
 So let's say you go to sleep at,

1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:02.600
 you get home after this 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift,

1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:05.480
 you maybe eat something, you go to sleep,

1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:10.480
 and you wake up and it's noon or 1 p.m.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:13.060
 Should you get light in your eyes?

1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:14.600
 Well, your first assumption,

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:15.880
 based on what I've said previously,

1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:17.680
 might be that you're in the circadian dead zone,

1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:20.280
 that you can't because it's noon or 1 p.m.

1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:21.800
 But you're not in the circadian dead zone

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.800
 because you're somebody who goes to sleep

1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:27.300
 early in the morning at 2 a.m.

1:02:27.300 --> 1:02:29.740
 So it's not like the circadian dead zone

1:02:29.740 --> 1:02:31.580
 is a strict time of day.

1:02:31.580 --> 1:02:34.040
 It's an internal biological clock.

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:36.080
 So what do you need to know?

1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:37.000
 You guessed it.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.200
 You need to know your temperature minimum.

1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:40.880
 You need to know whether or not

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:43.720
 your temperature is increasing or decreasing.

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.820
 And now we can make this whole thing even simpler

1:02:45.820 --> 1:02:49.680
 and just say, if your temperature is decreasing,

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:51.360
 avoid light.

1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:54.520
 If your temperature is increasing, get light.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:58.480
 It's that simple, okay?

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:01.120
 If your temperature is decreasing, avoid light.

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:03.620
 If your temperature is increasing, get light.

1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:09.920
 The shift worker who works from 4 p.m. until 2 a.m.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.880
 has a temperature rhythm that's very different than mine

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:15.600
 where I wake up around 6 a.m., 5 a.m.,

1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:19.720
 and I go to sleep around 11 p.m., okay?

1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:23.560
 We both have a 24 hour-ish circadian cycle

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.960
 except mine is more aligned to the rise

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:29.900
 and setting of the sun and theirs is not, right?

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:33.360
 So you have to know your internal temperature rhythm

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:37.220
 and know you don't have to walk around with a thermometer

1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:39.360
 wherever taking your temperature.

1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:41.160
 Although it'd be great if some of the devices

1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:43.440
 that are out there, people are counting their steps.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:45.040
 I think it'd be great if people had

1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:46.960
 a circadian body temperature measurement.

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:48.900
 I'm not involved in any of this device development,

1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:52.060
 but I think it's a real call to arms, pun intended,

1:03:52.060 --> 1:03:55.040
 to have a wristband that would measure temperature

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:56.500
 and would tell you your temperature minimum

1:03:56.500 --> 1:03:57.560
 when you travel or whatnot.

1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:00.240
 I don't know, maybe some of these devices already do that,

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.500
 but if they don't, they should.

1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:03.600
 It's absolutely absurd to me

1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:05.080
 why we wouldn't have this simple measurement.

1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:07.400
 Very easy to get that kind of information.

1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:10.480
 You don't even need the exact temperature read.

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:13.120
 All you need to know is the high and low point.

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.880
 So let's say you're a shift worker

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:18.240
 who really is nocturnal, you're flipped.

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:20.920
 Well, you want to stay on that nocturnal schedule.

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:22.760
 Now, that can be very hard on families

1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:25.000
 and social life of all kinds,

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.960
 but the person who is working, say, from 8 p.m.,

1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:34.400
 like sundown to sunrise, this raises a question.

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:37.200
 Should they be looking at the sunrise

1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:39.480
 and should they be watching the sunset,

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:43.080
 waking up with the sunset, going to sleep with the sunrise?

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:45.680
 You think, well, is that light going to throw them off?

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.160
 Ah, probably not.

1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:48.480
 It's just actually going to invert

1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:50.200
 what sunrise and sunset are.

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:52.600
 When they're waking up in the morning,

1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:55.700
 if they get some sunlight in their eyes,

1:04:55.700 --> 1:04:57.440
 they look at the sun and get some bright light

1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:01.040
 from devices or overhead lights in their apartment or home,

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.200
 well, that's going to tend to wake them up

1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:06.240
 if it's in the evening, right?

1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:08.760
 So I don't know if I stated that clearly,

1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:10.360
 but if in the evening the sun is setting

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:11.800
 and they're looking at that setting sun,

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:15.420
 that is the morning sun for that person

1:05:15.420 --> 1:05:18.520
 and it will wake them up for their night shift.

1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:20.280
 So temperature rising.

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.600
 Then toward morning, what's happening?

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:24.400
 Okay, well, they're closing out their work shift.

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:25.720
 You're going home.

1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:26.980
 The sun is rising.

1:05:26.980 --> 1:05:28.440
 Do you look at the rising sun?

1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:31.280
 Well, based on what you now know,

1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:32.680
 your eyes are very sensitive

1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:34.040
 to resetting of circadian clocks.

1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:35.360
 What will it do at that time?

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:36.240
 If this were a classroom,

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:38.280
 I would either cold call on somebody

1:05:38.280 --> 1:05:41.480
 or I'd wait for the oh, oh, oh, oh person in the audience.

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:42.880
 It inevitably exists.

1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:46.760
 So temperature for that person,

1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:48.040
 they've been up for a while.

1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:50.320
 Temperature is falling, not rising.

1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:52.380
 For me, it would be rising,

1:05:52.380 --> 1:05:56.520
 but because I'm diurnal, I'm awake during the day.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:58.280
 For that person, the temperature is falling

1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:01.120
 and so they view light while temperature is falling.

1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:01.960
 What's it going to do?

1:06:01.960 --> 1:06:04.000
 It's going to phase delay them.

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.400
 It's going to make it harder for them

1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:07.240
 to get to sleep the following night.

1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:10.500
 So you would say that person should watch the setting sun

1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.160
 to help them wake up

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:13.580
 because they're going to work the night shift,

1:06:13.580 --> 1:06:15.200
 but should probably have sunglasses on

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:19.160
 or avoid viewing bright light before they go to sleep.

1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:20.200
 So it's the same thing.

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:21.320
 They're just on an inverted,

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:24.240
 as a typical person who's diurnal,

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:26.520
 but they're on an inverted schedule.

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.840
 So I'm really trying hard here

1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:31.120
 to make this all really clear.

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:35.600
 There are kind of two patterns of requests in the world

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:37.240
 I'm noticing as I've kind of ventured

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:40.840
 into this landscape of social media and podcasts.

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:42.480
 There are people who want to know every detail

1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:43.600
 and want to quantify everything

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.000
 because they want to get exactly right.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.700
 These are like the graduate students and students

1:06:47.700 --> 1:06:49.180
 that don't want to make a mistake.

1:06:49.180 --> 1:06:51.220
 And to quote my graduate advisor,

1:06:51.220 --> 1:06:54.600
 provided the mistakes are not dangerous,

1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:56.160
 certainly not lethal,

1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:59.720
 you kind of want to make a few little mistakes

1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:01.620
 so that you can adjust, right?

1:07:01.620 --> 1:07:03.080
 You don't want to endanger yourself,

1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:05.960
 but it's actually, you're not going to get things perfect.

1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:06.780
 That's called learning.

1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:07.880
 Learning is when you realize,

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:10.020
 ah, I viewed sun this time and then I stayed up

1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:11.160
 and it really messed me up.

1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:12.460
 I'll never do that again.

1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:18.040
 The other category of people seem to want

1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:20.160
 the one size fits all kind of like,

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:22.820
 give me this pill or give me this protocol.

1:07:22.820 --> 1:07:25.000
 And those things generally work,

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.560
 but they don't afford people flexibility.

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:29.580
 And if there's anything like that,

1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:31.820
 it's this temperature minimum thing

1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:33.720
 that I've been just hammering on again

1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:34.700
 and again and again today,

1:07:34.700 --> 1:07:36.840
 because it's something that you own

1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:39.820
 and that you can really use as a key landmark

1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:41.760
 for shifting your clock.

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:44.140
 I suppose there's a third category,

1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:48.040
 which is people who accept that biological systems

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:49.600
 are actually much more forgiving

1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:51.960
 than the way they're sometimes described.

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:53.800
 And I'm going to use this as an opportunity

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:56.120
 to editorialize a little bit.

1:07:56.120 --> 1:07:58.540
 You know, there's so much made of sleep debt.

1:07:58.540 --> 1:08:01.480
 Look, there isn't an IRS equivalent for sleep.

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:02.560
 They're not going to come around

1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:05.520
 and try and collect all the sleep that you didn't get.

1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:09.080
 No one really knows what the consequences

1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:10.840
 are going to be for you and for me

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.020
 and for the next person for the sleep you didn't get.

1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:16.900
 You can't really recover the sleep you missed out on,

1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:19.380
 but you also don't want to get neurotically attached

1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:20.660
 to a schedule because there's this thing

1:08:20.660 --> 1:08:21.700
 called sleep anxiety,

1:08:21.700 --> 1:08:23.200
 and then people have trouble falling asleep

1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:24.080
 and staying asleep.

1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:25.840
 So I want to spend a moment on that

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:29.200
 and go back to a theme that I've said many times before,

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:30.960
 because these tools work,

1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:33.480
 what I called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.240
 So this would be hypnosis.

1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:37.360
 I give you the link, but I'll say it again,

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:41.440
 reveriehealth.com for clinically tested, research tested,

1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.440
 free hypnosis for anxiety, but also for sleep.

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.120
 Those are very beneficial people.

1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:50.440
 NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols

1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:53.140
 for things like yoga nidra.

1:08:53.140 --> 1:08:54.720
 I provide some links to those in the caption

1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.280
 for episode two.

1:08:56.280 --> 1:08:57.240
 These things really work.

1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:00.200
 Last night I woke up, I went to bed about 1030.

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:02.120
 I woke up at three in the morning.

1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:04.360
 I knew I wasn't feeling rested.

1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:07.200
 I did a NSDR protocol.

1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:08.280
 I fell back asleep.

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:10.520
 I woke up at 630, okay?

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:13.440
 You need to teach your brain and your nervous system

1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:15.720
 how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep.

1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:17.340
 And ideally you do that without medication,

1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:18.740
 unless there's a real need,

1:09:18.740 --> 1:09:20.360
 you do that through these behavioral protocols.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:23.720
 They work because they involve using the body

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:24.540
 to shift the mind,

1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:26.000
 not trying to just turn off your thoughts

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.420
 in the middle of the night.

1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:28.960
 Now, there are periods of life

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:30.760
 where things are stressful and people are concerned

1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:35.240
 and you will have some struggle getting and staying asleep.

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:39.020
 And that really has to do more with anxiety,

1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:42.520
 which NSDR protocols also can help with.

1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:43.960
 As I always say, do them in the middle of the night

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:45.420
 if you wake up and you want to go back to sleep,

1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:46.260
 do in the middle of the day

1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:47.540
 to teach your nervous system how to calm down

1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:48.560
 or do them first thing in the morning

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:49.800
 if you didn't feel you got enough sleep.

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:52.080
 In other words, do them whenever you have an opportunity

1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:55.960
 to do them because they really can help you learn

1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:00.200
 how to turn on the parasympathetic slash calming arm

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:01.840
 of your autonomic nervous system.

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:05.500
 There's no other way that I'm aware of

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:07.780
 to teach your system to slow down

1:10:07.780 --> 1:10:09.460
 and turn off your thoughts and go back to sleep.

1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:10.660
 But these are powerful protocols

1:10:10.660 --> 1:10:12.120
 and there's a lot of research now

1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:15.120
 to support the fact that they can really help.

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:17.060
 Meditation would be another example.

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:20.880
 Meditation of certain kinds of meditation

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:23.180
 involve focus and alertness.

1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:25.140
 Those are slightly different than meditations

1:10:25.140 --> 1:10:26.660
 that involve lack of focus

1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:29.240
 and attention to say internal states.

1:10:30.740 --> 1:10:31.620
 I'm going to pause there

1:10:31.620 --> 1:10:34.020
 and then I want to talk about kids and the elderly.

1:10:34.020 --> 1:10:37.620
 In other words, how do we control sleep

1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:40.740
 and circadian rhythms and wakefulness in babies,

1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:44.820
 adolescents, teens, and aged folks?

1:10:44.820 --> 1:10:49.060
 All right, before we talk about sleep and kids,

1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:50.620
 I want to tell a little story.

1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:52.060
 It's not a joke.

1:10:52.060 --> 1:10:53.060
 Many of you will be relieved

1:10:53.060 --> 1:10:54.780
 that I'm not going to try and tell another joke

1:10:54.780 --> 1:10:58.160
 this episode, which is the relationship

1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:02.700
 between light, skin, and pelage color,

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:08.860
 dopamine, and reproduction, mating.

1:11:09.100 --> 1:11:13.980
 So many seasonally breeding animals,

1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:16.060
 Siberian hamsters, which I mentioned earlier,

1:11:16.060 --> 1:11:20.420
 rabbits, fox, other animals change their color

1:11:20.420 --> 1:11:22.020
 of their coat.

1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:24.140
 In the winter, they tend to be a lighter color,

1:11:24.140 --> 1:11:28.380
 sometimes a pure white, sometimes with flecks of black

1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:31.380
 or brown, and in the summer,

1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:36.380
 their pelage changes to a color of brown or red,

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:38.420
 some other vastly different color.

1:11:39.620 --> 1:11:43.580
 That shift is controlled by light and by melatonin.

1:11:45.580 --> 1:11:48.680
 This has an interesting correlate in humans.

1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:52.640
 So humans obviously have different skin tones

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:56.140
 just genetically because of the amount of melanin

1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:59.180
 in one's skin, depending on genetic background.

1:12:00.220 --> 1:12:02.900
 But of course, sunlight will increase the amount

1:12:02.900 --> 1:12:05.660
 of melanin in the skin regardless, right?

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:09.400
 This is suntan, sunburn, et cetera, bronzing, whatever.

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:16.500
 The whole system is wired so that shifts in skin color

1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:20.900
 and shifts in these cells within the eye and melatonin

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:22.420
 are actually very closely linked.

1:12:22.420 --> 1:12:23.460
 So here's the story.

1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:29.860
 Many years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago,

1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:35.040
 let's see, it was 20 years ago, forgive me,

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:39.540
 a guy named Iggy Provencio who was running his own lab

1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:42.220
 at Uniformed Armed Services,

1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:45.020
 this is a standard biological laboratory,

1:12:45.020 --> 1:12:50.020
 discovered that there was an opsin in the eye,

1:12:50.100 --> 1:12:51.640
 in the cells of the eye that connect

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:54.340
 to the rest of the brain called melanopsin.

1:12:54.340 --> 1:12:56.300
 Melanopsin, as many of you now know,

1:12:56.300 --> 1:12:59.800
 is the opsin, it's like a pigment, it absorbs light.

1:13:00.900 --> 1:13:03.700
 It is the opsin that converts light into electrical signals

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:05.300
 and then set the circadian clock.

1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:12.100
 Iggy discovered melanopsin because it was similar in form

1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:18.660
 to what was in frog melanophores.

1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:20.980
 It was actually in the skin of frogs

1:13:20.980 --> 1:13:24.700
 that allowed those frogs to go from pale white

1:13:24.700 --> 1:13:28.260
 when it was dark for most of the 24-hour cycle

1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:33.100
 to pigmented, green or brown for a frog.

1:13:34.060 --> 1:13:37.820
 So there's this relationship between the cells in our eye

1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:39.620
 and the pigment cells of our skin.

1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:44.280
 And we also know that in long days, there's more breeding.

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:45.120
 How does that work?

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.500
 Well, that's actually from dopamine

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:51.300
 triggering increases in testosterone mainly in males

1:13:51.300 --> 1:13:52.980
 and estrogen mainly in females,

1:13:52.980 --> 1:13:55.400
 although of course there's testosterone estrogen

1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:57.180
 in both sexes.

1:13:57.180 --> 1:14:01.420
 So we have this kind of pathway where it's light,

1:14:01.420 --> 1:14:04.780
 increases in melanin, dopamine and reproduction

1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:07.040
 on the one hand and lack of light,

1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:11.860
 melatonin decreases in the darkness of skin,

1:14:11.860 --> 1:14:14.380
 less melanin in the skin,

1:14:14.380 --> 1:14:16.980
 or in the case of an animal with fur, white fur

1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:18.920
 and no reproduction on the other hand.

1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:24.780
 And humans don't actually shift their breeding patterns

1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:28.380
 tremendously from long days and short days,

1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:31.640
 although there are some data that there's some shifts.

1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:34.560
 We also don't radically change our skin color

1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:37.560
 depending on how much sunlight exposure we have.

1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:41.680
 But the simple way to put this is when days are long,

1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:44.740
 there's a lot more dopamine and we feel really good

1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:47.940
 and there's a lot more breeding and breeding like behavior.

1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:51.660
 When days are short, there's a lot less dopamine

1:14:51.660 --> 1:14:53.420
 and a lot less breeding behavior

1:14:53.420 --> 1:14:57.660
 because these pathways are very highly conserved.

1:14:57.660 --> 1:15:02.180
 Now, what's interesting is that as we've moved

1:15:02.180 --> 1:15:06.240
 into a modern society where much of our waking days,

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:08.040
 we are looking at screens, which is fine

1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:09.380
 because we're getting a lot of light that way,

1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:11.140
 although not as much as sunlight,

1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:14.180
 but also at night, we're getting a lot of light

1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:17.960
 from screens, what's happened is all these pathways,

1:15:19.380 --> 1:15:23.060
 melanin in the skin, turnover of skin cells, dopamine,

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:26.620
 all of this stuff has become completely disrupted.

1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:28.640
 Now, that's not to say that we should go back to a time

1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:30.620
 in which we didn't use artificial lights,

1:15:30.620 --> 1:15:32.400
 but I think the important thing to realize

1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:36.320
 is that feeling good with getting a lot of light,

1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:42.560
 the relationship to dopamine and melanin in the skin

1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:46.440
 and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin,

1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:47.980
 provided you're not getting burned

1:15:47.980 --> 1:15:50.540
 or you're not getting excessive UV exposure,

1:15:50.540 --> 1:15:53.160
 those are not just coincidences,

1:15:53.160 --> 1:15:55.400
 those are hardwired biological mechanisms

1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:56.460
 that exist in everybody,

1:15:56.460 --> 1:16:00.060
 regardless of how light or dark your skin is to begin with.

1:16:01.260 --> 1:16:03.220
 There's another point which is important,

1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:05.760
 which is that the dopamine system,

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.900
 which is this feel-good molecule,

1:16:07.900 --> 1:16:11.620
 is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen

1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:12.700
 in reproductive cycles.

1:16:12.700 --> 1:16:16.640
 Remember, melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:19.460
 luteinizing hormone and the production of these hormones

1:16:19.460 --> 1:16:21.520
 and melatonin is the effector,

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.440
 it is the hormone of darkness.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:27.920
 So I just threw a lot of biology at you

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:30.820
 and I'm not saying you're like a Siberian hamster,

1:16:30.820 --> 1:16:32.800
 at least not in ways that I'm aware of,

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:36.120
 I'm not saying that your pelage color is going to change.

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.840
 Actually, the reason people go gray

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:40.760
 is because when you're really stressed, did you know this?

1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:42.440
 When you're really stressed,

1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:44.680
 there's an increase in the nerve fibers

1:16:44.680 --> 1:16:48.320
 that release adrenaline to the hair follicle

1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:52.860
 and that activates peroxide groups in the hair follicle

1:16:52.860 --> 1:16:55.600
 that cause the hair to actually go gray or white.

1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:58.760
 So actually, stress does make your hair gray or white,

1:16:58.760 --> 1:16:59.840
 aging does it too.

1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:03.140
 That was a brief aside,

1:17:03.140 --> 1:17:04.820
 but for those of you that are interested

1:17:04.820 --> 1:17:07.640
 in the relationship between light and skin tone

1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:08.480
 and all that kind of stuff,

1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:09.520
 I thought you might find it interesting

1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:11.960
 that these cells in your eye are a lot like

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:15.360
 these skin cells in frogs or in animals

1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:18.080
 that shift their entire color

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:20.360
 and sometimes it will metamorphosize.

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.500
 You know, there are some species that literally change shape

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:23.460
 in the reproductive organs.

1:17:23.460 --> 1:17:25.940
 In fact, if that wasn't weird enough,

1:17:25.940 --> 1:17:27.700
 when I was in graduate school at Berkeley,

1:17:27.700 --> 1:17:30.880
 there was another graduate student studying a species

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:33.600
 of hermaphroditic mole, right?

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:35.320
 Those little things that dig.

1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:39.760
 Hermaphroditic mole that would change from having ovaries

1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:43.880
 to testes and back again depending on day life.

1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:46.080
 Super cool, super different

1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:50.000
 and wild biological mechanism.

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.880
 If you're wondering how those animals reproduce,

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.020
 they actually adjust the numbers of males and females

1:17:55.020 --> 1:17:56.760
 depending on the density of males and females.

1:17:56.760 --> 1:17:58.420
 So if there are too many males,

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:02.920
 some of the males turn their testes into ovaries

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:03.960
 and if there are too many females,

1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:05.640
 they turn their ovaries into testes.

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:08.640
 They actually are true hermaphroditic animals

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.840
 as opposed to pseudo hermaphroditic animals.

1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:13.940
 Okay, let's get back on track.

1:18:13.940 --> 1:18:17.160
 Let's talk about the animal that most of you care about

1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:18.540
 which is the human animal.

1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:22.120
 New parents and babies.

1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:26.880
 All right, as I mentioned earlier, melatonin is not cyclic.

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:29.560
 It's not cycling in babies, it's more phasic.

1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:32.680
 It's being released at a kind of a constant level

1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:35.920
 and babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are

1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:38.740
 and so those concentrations of melatonin are very high.

1:18:38.740 --> 1:18:41.680
 As a baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume

1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:42.680
 are going to go down.

1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:47.320
 Babies are not born with a typical sleep-wake cycle

1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:48.960
 and now all the parents saying,

1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:50.560
 tell me something I didn't know.

1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:55.440
 They also have, and I really want to emphasize this,

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:59.780
 they also have much more sensitive optics of the eye.

1:18:59.780 --> 1:19:02.200
 So a number of people have asked me,

1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:04.780
 should I be exposing my baby to sunlight?

1:19:04.780 --> 1:19:06.240
 You don't want to avoid sunlight

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:08.240
 but their eyes are very sensitive,

1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:10.560
 the optics of their eyes aren't quite developed.

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:14.520
 So much so that when you look at a newborn baby

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.720
 and they look a little glassy on

1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:17.760
 and they're kind of looking through you

1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:20.300
 or even a young child, a lot of people think

1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:23.080
 that they're seeing you the way that you're seeing them.

1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:24.080
 Hate to break it to you

1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:29.080
 but if you ever can just Google a visual image

1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:33.400
 of a like a one month old, the optics of their eyes

1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:35.960
 are so poor that you're a cloudy image.

1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:38.180
 They're not seeing your fine detail.

1:19:38.180 --> 1:19:39.840
 As the optics get better,

1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:43.280
 then they will see you with more and more clarity.

1:19:43.280 --> 1:19:45.060
 But a lot of that is clearing of the lens

1:19:45.060 --> 1:19:48.880
 and some of the other aqueous features of the newborn eye.

1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:50.400
 They don't see very well

1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:54.260
 but they also don't have such great ways

1:19:54.260 --> 1:19:55.700
 of adjusting to bright light.

1:19:55.700 --> 1:19:58.320
 And so babies have a natural aversion to bright light.

1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:00.280
 So you really want to avoid

1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:02.360
 trying to use sunlight or really bright light

1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:04.240
 in the same way that you would for an adult

1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:06.920
 on a young baby or child.

1:20:06.920 --> 1:20:10.120
 As children get older however,

1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:13.160
 melatonin does start to become slightly more cyclic,

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:14.400
 slightly more cycled.

1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:15.920
 And their body temperature rhythms

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:19.280
 also start to fall into a more regular,

1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:20.920
 not quite 24 hour rhythm.

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.480
 They're more of these all trading rhythms.

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:26.720
 So in episode, I think it was one or two of the podcast

1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:28.840
 or maybe both, we talked about these 90 minute

1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:32.280
 so-called ultradian rhythms where every 90 minutes

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:37.640
 babies are going through a cycle of body temperature

1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:39.160
 and some other hormonal features.

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:42.060
 I mean, so much is changing in their system.

1:20:42.060 --> 1:20:45.640
 So what to do if a child isn't sleeping?

1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:49.440
 You can use phases of darkness and phases of light

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:50.880
 but they're going to have to be shortened

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:52.440
 in order to try and encourage sleep

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:53.600
 when you want the child to sleep.

1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:55.680
 It's not that they're just not going to fall

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:58.740
 into an adult light regime of a temperature minimum

1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:00.120
 and a temperature maximum.

1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:01.680
 Their temperature minimums and maximums

1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:03.800
 are fluctuating much more quickly

1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:05.380
 and it varies tremendously.

1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:08.680
 Actually, there's an interesting literature

1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:10.040
 of whether or not they have siblings,

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.000
 whether or not they're twins,

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.120
 whether or not they're in a nursery environment,

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:14.640
 whether or not they're alone,

1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:15.760
 well, hopefully the baby's not alone

1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:16.600
 but you know what I mean?

1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:17.600
 That they're sleeping alone in a room

1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:19.640
 while you're in the other room.

1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:21.620
 There are a couple of things that seem to help

1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:23.480
 which is getting the overall environment

1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:25.200
 into a 24 hour schedule.

1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:27.840
 So having the room slightly colder,

1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:29.960
 obviously you want babies to be nice and cozy,

1:21:29.960 --> 1:21:32.740
 slightly colder when you would like them to be asleep,

1:21:32.740 --> 1:21:34.120
 slightly warmer for the times

1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:35.120
 you would like them to be awake.

1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:37.920
 Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway

1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:43.000
 and obviously you want to be very careful

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:47.200
 about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot.

1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:50.980
 So if they're going through these 90 minute cycles,

1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:52.280
 you're going to have to adjust

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:53.800
 those 90 minute cycles as well.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:55.800
 So then people say, well, that's not going to help me at all

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:57.280
 because how do I deal with the fact

1:21:57.280 --> 1:21:59.440
 that I need to be up every 90 minutes at night?

1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:02.160
 There are a couple tools that can be helpful.

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:06.320
 The first one is going to be to try and understand

1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:09.640
 the relationship between calm and deep sleep.

1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:11.720
 So the autonomic nervous system

1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:14.260
 can put us into states of panic

1:22:14.260 --> 1:22:16.700
 where that's kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:18.040
 goes all the way to panic

1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:20.560
 or it can be alertness or it can be alert and calm, right?

1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:23.120
 So there's a range there, it's a continuum.

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:26.040
 Can also be that you're in deep sleep,

1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:27.720
 so the other end of the seesaw is way up

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:30.080
 or you're in light sleep or you're kind of sleepy

1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:32.140
 or you're just feeling kind of relaxed.

1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:36.280
 Perhaps the most important thing

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:39.520
 if you're having to map to a baby's schedule

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:41.780
 in order to make sure that they're getting changings

1:22:41.780 --> 1:22:44.340
 and nursing, et cetera, at the appropriate times

1:22:44.340 --> 1:22:48.360
 is to try and maintain,

1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:51.840
 if you can't sleep or you can't sleep continuously,

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:56.040
 to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system

1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:58.080
 in a place where you're not

1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.440
 going into heightened states of alertness

1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:03.100
 when you would ideally be sleeping.

1:23:03.100 --> 1:23:05.920
 Now, I realize that this could be translated

1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:07.880
 to try and stay calm while you're sleep deprived

1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:10.000
 which is very hard for people to do

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.360
 but this is where

1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:13.720
 the non-sleep deep breath protocol surface again

1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:16.120
 and can potentially be very beneficial

1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:19.920
 for people to be able to recover not necessarily sleep

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:22.360
 but for them to maintain a certain amount

1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:24.000
 of autonomic regulation.

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.040
 So what would this look like?

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:27.200
 This would look like a baby goes down,

1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:29.560
 maybe it's only going to go down for 45 minutes.

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:31.440
 If you can capture sleep,

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.960
 there are some data showing what's called polyphasic sleep.

1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:38.960
 If you can sleep in 45 minute increments or batches,

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:40.620
 even if it's spread throughout the day

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:42.120
 with periods of wakefulness in between,

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:43.240
 as miserable as that sound,

1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:44.160
 there are actually some adults

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:46.080
 that have deliberately employed that

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.280
 who don't have children for sake of work productivity

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.880
 and it does tend to reduce the total overall amount

1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:53.560
 of sleep that you need.

1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:55.760
 It is a very hard schedule for most people to maintain

1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:56.600
 but if you have a baby,

1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:57.560
 the baby may be throwing you

1:23:57.560 --> 1:23:58.840
 into that kind of schedule anyway.

1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:02.040
 So if you can get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great.

1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:03.960
 If you can get another 45 minutes after waking

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:05.800
 and then they go back down to sleep, great.

1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:07.800
 So as many phases of sleep as you can get

1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:09.600
 but if you can't sleep,

1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:12.480
 the data on non-sleep deep rest type protocols

1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:15.480
 does show that at least from a neurochemical level,

1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:16.820
 I want to be clear what that means,

1:24:16.820 --> 1:24:20.440
 reset of things like dopamine levels in the basal ganglia,

1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:22.800
 measured by things like positron emission tomography,

1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:26.640
 et cetera, those things tend to reset themselves pretty well

1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:29.140
 if you can access these deep rest states.

1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:32.280
 So that means not being alert

1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:34.200
 throughout the entire time that the baby is sleeping,

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:37.440
 trying to sort of mirror the baby's sleep cycle,

1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:39.040
 which can be brutal for certain people

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:40.820
 and especially if you're trying to prepare meals

1:24:40.820 --> 1:24:41.660
 and do all these things.

1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:43.380
 So I do recognize that there are a lot of constraints

1:24:43.380 --> 1:24:44.560
 on parenting, not just mapping

1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:46.360
 on your baby's sleep schedule.

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:50.960
 As children approach ages one, two, three, four,

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:54.440
 that's when certainly the optics of the eyes have improved

1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:56.440
 but you don't want to damage the eyes, of course,

1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:57.960
 with very bright light.

1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.600
 They are much more sensitive

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:02.940
 even until they're kind of 10, 11 years old.

1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:06.440
 And we'll talk about vision in children in a moment

1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.000
 but trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep

1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.240
 through, hopefully not through the use

1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:15.440
 of administering melatonin to the kids

1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:17.740
 because that's what I talked about before,

1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:19.540
 why that could potentially be detrimental.

1:25:19.540 --> 1:25:21.100
 Talk about that with your doctor.

1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:25.840
 But more so trying to get longer blocks of sleep

1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:27.980
 that map onto these ultradian cycles.

1:25:27.980 --> 1:25:30.560
 So it would be better off to get a three hour,

1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:32.080
 like two 90 minute cycles,

1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:34.240
 than a four hour batch of sleep

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:36.820
 because waking up in the middle of those ultradian cycles

1:25:36.820 --> 1:25:39.440
 can just be brutal for parent and kid.

1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:42.800
 So if one can't get a full six or 10

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:44.600
 or some kids should even be sleeping 12 hours

1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:45.800
 when they're growing quickly,

1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:47.900
 trying to get batches of sleep,

1:25:47.900 --> 1:25:51.020
 even if they're fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle

1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:54.000
 that are matched more to these 90 minute cycles,

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.600
 meaning maybe one ultradian cycle of 90 minutes

1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:01.080
 or two back to back or three back to back to back,

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:02.540
 that's going to be better than waking up

1:26:02.540 --> 1:26:04.240
 in the middle of an ultradian cycle.

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:06.860
 It's just going to set any number of other things

1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:10.760
 in a better direction than were you to try to say,

1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:15.040
 just enforce or force a full eight or 10 hours of sleep.

1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:17.380
 That's at least what the literature shows.

1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:19.160
 Some kids sleep great through the night

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:20.920
 starting at a very young age, others don't.

1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:22.420
 I typically hear from people

1:26:22.420 --> 1:26:24.320
 who are struggling tremendously.

1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:26.320
 They're losing their mind understandably

1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:29.500
 because they're not sleeping, their kid's not sleeping

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.280
 or their kid is sleeping for such brief periods.

1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:33.660
 So in other words, trying to access deep calm

1:26:33.660 --> 1:26:34.500
 if you can't sleep,

1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:35.920
 trying to access sleep if you can sleep

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:37.240
 even if it's fractured.

1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:39.440
 And then you say, well, what about all the sunlight viewing

1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:44.440
 and the exercise stuff when sleep is really, really

1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:47.560
 dismantled in meaning it's happening

1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:49.440
 in various times of day or night.

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:52.600
 That's especially, at those times,

1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:54.960
 it's going to be especially important for the parent

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:56.600
 to get morning and evening sunlight

1:26:56.600 --> 1:26:59.520
 because your circadian clock is going into a tailspin

1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:01.720
 and it basically wants to anchor to something.

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:02.920
 So you want to give it two anchors,

1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:05.320
 morning and evening light, okay?

1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:07.560
 So this is rather different

1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:09.160
 than what I described for shift work.

1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:10.760
 This is when things are really chaotic

1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:12.080
 and you're just not able to sleep.

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:13.600
 Similar circumstances can arise

1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:15.500
 if you're taking care of a very sick loved one,

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:16.840
 you're up all night,

1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:19.420
 try and stay calm using NSDR protocols.

1:27:19.420 --> 1:27:22.620
 I know it's harder to do than to say,

1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:24.880
 but those protocols are there, they're free,

1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.600
 there's research to support them.

1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:28.640
 Try and get sleep whenever you can,

1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:31.920
 but also try to get morning sunlight

1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:34.160
 and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can

1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:37.600
 and if you can't get that, use artificial light, okay?

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.940
 What about later life?

1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:42.160
 So kids now, adolescents, teens,

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:46.260
 it is true that teens have a tendency to wake up later

1:27:46.260 --> 1:27:47.700
 and go to sleep later.

1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:50.580
 In part, just because they're sleeping a lot more,

1:27:50.580 --> 1:27:52.780
 they're churning out gonadotropin-releasing hormone

1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:56.340
 and luteinizing hormone, their whole bodies are changing.

1:27:56.340 --> 1:27:58.420
 I don't know whether or not people realize this,

1:27:58.420 --> 1:28:00.460
 but the fastest rate of aging

1:28:00.460 --> 1:28:03.480
 that any of us will ever undergo is puberty.

1:28:04.340 --> 1:28:06.060
 That is the fastest rate of aging.

1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:08.620
 And so there's a huge number of biological processes

1:28:08.620 --> 1:28:10.140
 that are happening during puberty.

1:28:10.140 --> 1:28:12.580
 Probably devote a whole episode to puberty

1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:16.640
 as a fascinating aspect to the life course,

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:19.340
 but it is an accelerated period of aging.

1:28:19.340 --> 1:28:24.340
 And the circadian clock mechanisms sometimes are very intact

1:28:24.500 --> 1:28:25.920
 and sometimes they're a little dismantled

1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:27.700
 and going through some change,

1:28:27.700 --> 1:28:31.260
 but prioritize the duration of sleep

1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:33.020
 for adolescents and teens.

1:28:33.020 --> 1:28:34.960
 Now, if that means they're sleeping until 2 p.m.

1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.680
 and then waking up and then they're up all night,

1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:38.540
 the up all night part can become a problem,

1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:41.300
 especially with all the devices texting in their rooms

1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:43.220
 or playing video games.

1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:45.080
 Morning and evening sunlight would be ideal,

1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:46.480
 but some kids are just going to sleep

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:47.800
 through the morning sunlight.

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:49.640
 However, if you were to measure their temperature,

1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:52.160
 what you would find is that their temperature minimum

1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:54.100
 would come later in the morning.

1:28:54.100 --> 1:28:57.100
 It's not going to be 8 a.m.,

1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:58.640
 it's going to be maybe even 10 a.m.

1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:01.200
 if they're sleeping until 11 or 12,

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:03.860
 or it might be 8 a.m. if they're sleeping until 10.

1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:05.500
 Remember, temperature minimum is two hours

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:08.300
 before your average waking time, typically.

1:29:08.300 --> 1:29:11.220
 So in teens, it maximizes the total amount of sleep.

1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:13.940
 Try and get regular sunlight either in the morning

1:29:13.940 --> 1:29:15.540
 or in the evening or both,

1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:17.260
 but if they're sleeping through the morning sunrise,

1:29:17.260 --> 1:29:20.440
 that's probably not as much of an issue.

1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:23.360
 Waking them up and depriving them of sleep is probably worse

1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:25.740
 because their T-min, their temperature minimum,

1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:27.960
 is actually falling later.

1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:30.760
 So their circadian dead zone is later, et cetera.

1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:32.720
 So I think with adolescents and teens,

1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:35.920
 it makes sense to kind of give them a little bit more rope

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:39.040
 in terms of allowing them some leeway

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.160
 to adjust their own schedule.

1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:42.200
 Some schools are even starting classes later

1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:45.080
 on the basis of some very good biology

1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:46.860
 to support this late-shifted rhythm

1:29:46.860 --> 1:29:48.500
 and this extended sleep phase.

1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:53.240
 There are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,

1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:54.840
 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,

1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:57.660
 and others at Stanford showing that turning on the lights

1:29:57.660 --> 1:29:59.800
 in the room of a teen before they wake up

1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:03.640
 helps them get more sleep the subsequent night.

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:05.280
 It also tricks them into going to sleep

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:06.120
 a little bit earlier,

1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:09.280
 but it gives them about 45 minutes more of deep sleep,

1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:10.980
 and that's been shown statistically.

1:30:10.980 --> 1:30:13.340
 Total sleep time increases as well.

1:30:13.340 --> 1:30:15.140
 If they're hiding under the covers, that's not going to work,

1:30:15.140 --> 1:30:17.040
 but their eyes don't have to be open.

1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:18.880
 I know a few parents now that are coming in

1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:22.760
 with a flashlight and flashing their kids over their eyelids

1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:24.940
 before they wake up in hopes of getting this to work.

1:30:24.940 --> 1:30:27.320
 Some have told me this is working.

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:29.680
 That's not part of a standard study,

1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:35.040
 but it does seem to work because, now you should know why,

1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:37.200
 because if light's getting through the eyelids

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:40.400
 and it's, say, 8 a.m. and the kid is still asleep

1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:41.800
 and they're going to wake up at 10,

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:44.920
 you're giving them light just after

1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:47.340
 or around their temperature minimum,

1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:50.120
 which is going to make them want to go to sleep earlier,

1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:51.560
 and in the case of teens,

1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:53.000
 for some reason we don't quite understand,

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:55.760
 sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer,

1:30:55.760 --> 1:30:57.280
 spend more time in deep sleep.

1:30:57.280 --> 1:30:58.320
 Adults can do this too.

1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:00.660
 If you can persuade someone or put your lights on timer

1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:02.960
 for lights to go on before you wake up,

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:06.200
 that's really going to help you wake up earlier, okay?

1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:08.920
 So if you're starting to hear some themes

1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:11.160
 are really resounding over and over again,

1:31:11.160 --> 1:31:13.360
 that should be reassuring to you, right?

1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:15.740
 These are core mechanisms.

1:31:15.740 --> 1:31:18.700
 Fortunately, there aren't a thousand different mechanisms.

1:31:18.700 --> 1:31:23.240
 Now, in the elderly, there's a real tendency

1:31:23.240 --> 1:31:27.280
 to want to go to sleep very early and wake up very early,

1:31:27.280 --> 1:31:31.200
 and people should talk to their physician.

1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:33.800
 There is some evidence that melatonin levels

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:36.180
 and patterns of melatonin secretion

1:31:36.180 --> 1:31:39.640
 can become a little chaotic in elderly folks.

1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:40.660
 What do I mean by elderly?

1:31:40.660 --> 1:31:41.560
 Well, it's going to differ.

1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:42.980
 Rates of aging differ, right?

1:31:42.980 --> 1:31:46.640
 You see some 65-year-olds that are struggling to move

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:50.040
 and seem much older than some 65-year-olds

1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:53.520
 that are still hustling around and have tons of energy.

1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:55.100
 There's a lot of variation.

1:31:55.100 --> 1:31:57.900
 Some of it's genetic, some of it's lifestyle factors.

1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:00.720
 It really varies.

1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:03.460
 Certainly lifestyle factors can play an important role

1:32:03.460 --> 1:32:04.660
 in rates of aging.

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:09.760
 I think that the most prominent results

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:12.840
 from sleep and circadian rhythms in the elderly

1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:15.800
 are they need to get as much natural light

1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:16.960
 even if it's through windows.

1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:20.200
 I realize that some elderly folks can't get outside

1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:21.040
 as easily.

1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:22.000
 It's not safe for them to do it.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:23.960
 They can't move around as easily.

1:32:25.100 --> 1:32:26.920
 Exercise can come in various forms

1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:29.400
 for people that can't get outside

1:32:29.400 --> 1:32:32.100
 and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling.

1:32:32.100 --> 1:32:33.320
 They're not able to do that.

1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:35.840
 Light through a window in that case, open window ideally,

1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:37.720
 but for temperature reasons, et cetera,

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:39.520
 sometimes the window has to be closed.

1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:40.840
 Getting people near that window

1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:43.580
 and away from artificial light early in the day

1:32:43.580 --> 1:32:46.740
 and away from artificial lights during the night phase

1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:49.440
 can have a tremendous effect.

1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:50.680
 And in the elderly,

1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:55.180
 that's when melatonin might be a viable option.

1:32:55.180 --> 1:32:57.020
 And this should be discussed with a physician, of course,

1:32:57.020 --> 1:33:00.920
 but you're way past the puberty time point.

1:33:00.920 --> 1:33:05.000
 In most cases, people who are in their 70s and 80s and 90s

1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:07.000
 are not churning out a lot of GnRH

1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:09.060
 and luteinizing hormone to begin with.

1:33:09.060 --> 1:33:11.540
 And that's where struggles with falling asleep

1:33:11.540 --> 1:33:12.920
 and staying asleep,

1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:15.520
 all the same parameters and things we've described before

1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:19.560
 still apply, light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:22.960
 but that's where melatonin might be of greatest benefit.

1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:24.680
 And again, I'm not pushing melatonin here,

1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:26.920
 but I think for elderly folks who are having trouble

1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:29.740
 falling and staying asleep, that might be worthwhile.

1:33:31.100 --> 1:33:33.760
 There are, and I should just also mention

1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:37.320
 that regular schedule for folks that are elderly

1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:40.880
 and as much natural light as safely possible,

1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:43.800
 those are going to be the key levers

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:46.180
 for adjusting sleep in circadian schedules.

1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:49.440
 I've mentioned before in previous podcasts,

1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:52.400
 other supplements besides melatonin.

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:55.120
 And some of those supplements are quite good for sleep.

1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:56.600
 I'm not a supplement pusher.

1:33:56.600 --> 1:33:59.360
 I am somebody who takes supplements.

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:00.280
 I believe in them.

1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:03.840
 Some have worked for me, some have not worked as well,

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:07.800
 but I certainly believe in getting the behaviors right,

1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:09.400
 whether or not it's NSDR protocols,

1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:11.760
 viewing natural light, exercise,

1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:15.760
 it's hot baths or cold showers or what have you,

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:18.120
 behavioral protocols first.

1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:19.160
 There are some supplements

1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:20.960
 that I've mentioned in previous podcasts,

1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:22.600
 but I've seemed to get a lot of questions about.

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:23.680
 So I just want to take a couple of minutes

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:25.520
 and just talk about some of the supplements

1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:29.220
 that can be beneficial for helping turning off thinking,

1:34:29.220 --> 1:34:30.820
 accessing deeper sleep,

1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:33.860
 and even being able to compact your sleep schedule

1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:35.200
 into a shorter period of hours,

1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:37.600
 meaning getting by well with less sleep.

1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:39.560
 People take a lot of sleeping pills.

1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:42.280
 I'm not going to tell people not to take sleeping pills.

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:44.560
 They can be very problematic, habit forming,

1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:49.360
 high side effect incidents in many cases.

1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:52.000
 Some people can handle them just fine.

1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.320
 Again, I'm not a physician.

1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:56.480
 I don't prescribe anything or a professor.

1:34:56.480 --> 1:34:59.800
 So I profess a lot of things, some of which are my opinion.

1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:02.060
 Although if you look at the scientific literature,

1:35:02.060 --> 1:35:03.600
 there's some impressive data

1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:06.780
 around some non-prescription drug type supplements

1:35:06.780 --> 1:35:09.440
 that have fairly high safety margins

1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:10.280
 that you might consider,

1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:11.900
 but you should talk to your doctor always

1:35:11.900 --> 1:35:13.720
 before adding or taking anything

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:15.700
 out of your health regimes, right?

1:35:15.700 --> 1:35:17.440
 Your health is not my responsibility.

1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:18.420
 It's your responsibility.

1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:20.200
 So be a stringent filter.

1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:22.240
 Along those lines, one of the most powerful

1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:24.440
 and useful tools that I've mentioned here on many times,

1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:26.560
 and I plan to mention many, many more times,

1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:29.600
 is the website examine.com,

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.800
 which I have no affiliation with,

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:33.200
 but is a wonderful site

1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:35.840
 that links you to quality peer-reviewed studies

1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:38.360
 related to just about any supplement,

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:40.440
 including some safety warnings.

1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:41.960
 We'll also tell you what subjects,

1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:45.440
 whether or not it was rats, cats, elderly folks, or kids,

1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:47.120
 that a given study was done on,

1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:50.760
 which is important, can be kind of hard to pull from sites

1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:52.680
 where people are just advertising supplements, right?

1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:54.640
 They usually don't tell you what the study was

1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:57.000
 and who were these rats?

1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.300
 Who were these kids?

1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:00.720
 Et cetera.

1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:04.120
 There are three supplements that, at least for me,

1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:08.120
 have had a tremendously positive effect on my sleep

1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:10.200
 that some of you might consider.

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:14.840
 I would say if you're doing everything properly,

1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:17.200
 behaviorally, and you're still having issues,

1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:19.840
 then supplements might be a good thing for you.

1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:21.600
 Or if you are traveling

1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:23.720
 and you want a little bit of extra help

1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:26.200
 in buffering your sleep wakefulness protocols.

1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:29.120
 Some people like to go just to the supplements.

1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:30.040
 They're like, what should I take?

1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:32.040
 I have people in my life that are like,

1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:32.920
 just tell me what to take.

1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:34.960
 You know, more of here's what you might want to do

1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:37.040
 or not do, but,

1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:39.120
 and then think about what you might want to take or not take.

1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.700
 But personal preference and it's free country,

1:36:42.700 --> 1:36:45.080
 so you can do what you like.

1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:48.780
 Magnesium.

1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:53.280
 So magnesium has been shown to increase the depth of sleep

1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:56.600
 and has been shown to decrease the amount of time

1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:59.920
 that it takes to access sleep, to fall asleep.

1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:01.640
 It comes in various forms.

1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:04.920
 I've talked a bunch of times about magnesium threonate,

1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:09.160
 T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate,

1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.160
 which seems to be the more bioavailable form of magnesium.

1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:16.420
 And magnesium threonate, it seems,

1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:19.360
 is shuttled preferentially to the brain,

1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:21.880
 which is where you want it.

1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:23.640
 And there are certain transporters,

1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:26.060
 it actually engages the GABA pathway,

1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:28.320
 which tends to turn off certain areas of the forebrain,

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:30.160
 allows you to fall asleep.

1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:34.080
 There is a study, if you would like to explore it,

1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:36.480
 since people serious about supplementation

1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:38.320
 might want to explore the study,

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:41.040
 which is Aetes et al., A-T-E-S,

1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:42.560
 dose dependent absorption profile

1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.960
 of different magnesium compounds.

1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:47.960
 Looks to me like a quality peer reviewed paper.

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:50.200
 I can put the link in the caption.

1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:52.920
 And it explores all the different forms of magnesium.

1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:56.080
 It does seem like magnesium glycinate

1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:57.840
 can be similar to magnesium threonate

1:37:57.840 --> 1:37:59.520
 in terms of which tissues it shuttled to.

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:02.320
 Magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,

1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:04.500
 is preferentially shuttled to the muscle, it appears,

1:38:04.500 --> 1:38:05.340
 as opposed to the brain.

1:38:05.340 --> 1:38:08.260
 So it's going to be more of a muscle repair type thing

1:38:08.260 --> 1:38:10.800
 or restoring magnesium stores in the periphery

1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:11.920
 as opposed to the brain.

1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:14.640
 Magnesium citrate has another name

1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:17.240
 that I won't mention in jest

1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:20.160
 because magnesium citrate's main effect,

1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:21.900
 at least on me and the people I know,

1:38:21.900 --> 1:38:24.100
 seems to be a laxative effect

1:38:24.100 --> 1:38:25.680
 as opposed to a cognitive effect.

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:27.160
 There's also some evidence

1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:29.880
 that magnesium threonate can be neuroprotective.

1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:32.380
 Those data come from quality labs,

1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:34.860
 mostly rodent studies, not human studies,

1:38:34.860 --> 1:38:36.160
 but it's kind of interesting.

1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:37.880
 And again, the safety margins for these things

1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:39.180
 tend to be pretty high,

1:38:39.180 --> 1:38:41.040
 but anytime you're going to take something new,

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.440
 you should approach it with caution,

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:44.640
 especially since magnesium could be involved

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:47.320
 in a heart rhythm and things of that sort.

1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:50.480
 The other supplement that has been very beneficial for me

1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:51.320
 is theanine.

1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:55.820
 So this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,

1:38:55.820 --> 1:38:59.560
 T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.

1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.920
 Theanine activates certain GABA pathways

1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:05.640
 which are involved in turning off top-down processing

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:08.720
 and thinking, making it easier to fall asleep.

1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.400
 And theanine, 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams,

1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:15.120
 has a calming effect.

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:16.320
 Theanine is now showing up

1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:19.320
 in a number of different energy drinks

1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:21.560
 and even some coffees as a way to try

1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:23.800
 and get people to ingest more of a given type of coffee

1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:26.640
 because the idea is it would take away the jitters

1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:29.660
 and the anxiety, allowing people to drink more coffee.

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:33.200
 I'm talking about taking magnesium and theanine

1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:35.020
 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,

1:39:35.020 --> 1:39:37.540
 not during the day to quell anxiety,

1:39:37.540 --> 1:39:40.100
 but rather 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime

1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:43.360
 with or without food for me has made a difference.

1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:45.920
 And the combination of those two things has really helped.

1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:49.200
 Theanine for sleepwalkers can be a problem.

1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:51.600
 It does increase the intensity of your dreams.

1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.920
 It gives you very vivid dreams.

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.040
 So for sleepwalkers or people that get night terrors,

1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:59.080
 stay away from theanine is my advice.

1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:01.320
 Magnesium, theanine might be something to explore

1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:03.560
 for those of you that don't have those issues

1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:05.520
 with the emphasis on might.

1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:07.380
 And then I've talked about a compound.

1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:10.560
 And last time I talked about the mechanisms of apigenin,

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:13.900
 which is a derivative of chamomile, A-P-I-G-E-N,

1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:16.600
 which acts as a little bit of a hypnotic

1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:17.960
 by activating chloride channels,

1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:20.860
 hyperpolarized neurons, increases GABA in the brain,

1:40:20.860 --> 1:40:23.720
 basically makes you feel a little sleepy.

1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:26.560
 And chamomile, for those of you that read your,

1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:31.200
 what was it, Peter Rabbit snuck into Mr. McGregor's garden,

1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:33.720
 ate the chamomile, fell asleep, Mr. McGregor came back.

1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:35.920
 Okay, anyone flashing back to elementary school?

1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.200
 Okay, there's a story about chamomile

1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:40.000
 having these kind of sedative-like effects.

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.480
 Apigenin is highly concentrated.

1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:44.500
 Chamomile also has anti-estrogenic effects.

1:40:44.500 --> 1:40:46.740
 So if you want to keep your estrogen up,

1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:49.160
 you might want to be cautious about apigenin.

1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:52.120
 That's where things like examine.com become really useful

1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:54.520
 because you can go to examine, you put in apigenin,

1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:56.240
 and it'll tell you all the things that it does,

1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:57.540
 and all the things that it does

1:40:57.540 --> 1:40:59.480
 can sometimes include things that you had no idea,

1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:04.480
 like reducing conversion of certain androgens to estrogens,

1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:07.560
 which you might like or you might want to avoid.

1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:09.660
 That's up to you and where you want your estrogen levels,

1:41:09.660 --> 1:41:10.640
 depending on who you are

1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:13.240
 and what your life circumstances and goals are.

1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:17.800
 A few other things that can help the transition to sleep

1:41:17.800 --> 1:41:20.800
 are things like 5-HTP, L-Tryptophan.

1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:22.920
 I've talked about why I'm not a fan of those.

1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:25.700
 For me, they tend to throw me into deep sleep,

1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:27.580
 and then I wake up and I can't fall back asleep.

1:41:27.580 --> 1:41:30.360
 So I don't like to tinker with my serotonin system.

1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:32.640
 I don't like to tinker with my dopamine system

1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:34.120
 for entirely other reasons,

1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:38.240
 but none of which are particularly concerning.

1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:40.320
 It's just that I find that if I increase my dopamine

1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:43.000
 by taking L-tyrosine in pill form,

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:44.640
 then I crash really hard the next day.

1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:47.000
 Or if I take 5-HTP or L-Tryptophan,

1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.720
 I fall deeply asleep and then I wake up.

1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:51.880
 But I did mention that there might be ways

1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:53.840
 to make sleep more compact.

1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:56.160
 And so this is actually a request to you.

1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:00.000
 I had a really interesting experience when I was a postdoc.

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.880
 I went for the first time to an acupuncturist.

1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:05.760
 I know there are varying thoughts and opinions out there

1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:06.880
 about acupuncture.

1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:11.880
 I can't say that I benefited so much from the acupuncture.

1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:14.840
 There are now quality peer-reviewed studies

1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:17.400
 published in Neuron, cell press journal, excellent journal,

1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:20.280
 showing that acupuncture can stimulate

1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:22.600
 some anti-inflammatory compounds,

1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:24.080
 depending on where the acupuncture is done.

1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:26.280
 There's a really good studies came out last year.

1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:27.480
 I talked about this on Instagram.

1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:28.720
 I may talk about it again.

1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:30.880
 As well as certain acupuncture sites

1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:32.580
 that increase inflammation.

1:42:32.580 --> 1:42:36.480
 So you can get different types of effects.

1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:39.480
 You can't just say acupuncture is great across the board.

1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:41.880
 And I'm assuming that the acupuncturists know

1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:43.760
 which sites are good for increasing inflammation,

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:46.640
 which ones are good for decreasing inflammation.

1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:50.400
 However, this acupuncturist that I went to

1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:52.040
 gave me these red pills.

1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:53.800
 He said, these are minerals for sleep.

1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:54.660
 And it was remarkable.

1:42:54.660 --> 1:42:56.240
 I took the red pills.

1:42:56.240 --> 1:42:57.280
 Isn't that the thing now?

1:42:57.280 --> 1:42:58.100
 Take the red pill.

1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:00.760
 I don't know what that means because I'm not tuned in.

1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:03.360
 But these red pills look like little M&Ms.

1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:05.440
 I took a couple of them on his suggestion.

1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:07.960
 And I fell deeply asleep and four hours later

1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:09.920
 woke up feeling incredibly rested,

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:12.000
 more rested than I had ever felt in my entire life.

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:13.940
 And I never required more than four hours sleep.

1:43:13.940 --> 1:43:16.240
 Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away.

1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:18.560
 I never figured out what was in those red pills.

1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:20.880
 I didn't get a chance to do the mass spectroscopy.

1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:24.000
 And I still wonder, he said they were minerals.

1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.360
 So somebody out there knows what these red pills are

1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:28.600
 and what this compound is.

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:30.920
 And it was incredible.

1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:33.640
 And I would love to know what those are.

1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:37.440
 So if you know, please don't go taking red pills at random

1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:41.880
 to try and recreate this non-experiment experience of mine.

1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:44.960
 But please do contact me if you find out

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:46.360
 or if you're an acupuncturist and you know

1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.560
 what these mysterious red pills were

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:51.740
 because they were pretty awesome.

1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:53.520
 Once again, I've thrown a tremendous amount

1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:55.620
 of information at you.

1:43:55.620 --> 1:43:58.180
 I hope you will figure out your temperature minimum

1:43:58.180 --> 1:44:02.200
 and start working with that to access the sleep

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:04.820
 and wakeful cycles that you want to access.

1:44:04.820 --> 1:44:07.420
 I hope that you'll explore NSDR.

1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:10.580
 You might want to explore supplementation

1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:11.900
 if that's your thing.

1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:14.920
 You have now access to a lot of mechanism

1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:16.640
 about sleep and wakefulness.

1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:18.580
 But in keeping with the theme of this podcast

1:44:18.580 --> 1:44:21.200
 where we stay on topic for an entire month

1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:22.520
 or even slightly more,

1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:24.920
 we are not done with sleep and wakefulness.

1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:26.720
 I know this is very different

1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:28.240
 than the typical podcast format

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:31.480
 where one week it's how to become superhuman

1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:35.800
 and the next week it's how to develop growth mindset.

1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:38.080
 It's kind of all over the place with episode to episode.

1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:40.900
 We are staying on track because I really believe

1:44:40.900 --> 1:44:43.760
 that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms

1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:45.900
 and you start hearing some of the same themes again

1:44:45.900 --> 1:44:49.360
 and again, you're going to start to develop an intuition

1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:51.700
 and an understanding of how these systems work in you

1:44:51.700 --> 1:44:53.760
 and your particular life circumstances.

1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:56.800
 And my goal is really to eventually become obsolete.

1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.620
 It's what my graduate advisor used to call

1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:00.800
 the hit by a bus principle.

1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:03.640
 She had a somewhat morbid sense of humor

1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:05.640
 and used to be, well, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow,

1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:09.200
 what are you going to do without me blabbing at you here?

1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:11.400
 So I don't want to get hit by a bus.

1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:13.000
 I plan on living a very long time

1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:14.840
 if I have anything to say about it,

1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:17.640
 but were I to get hit by a bus tomorrow,

1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:19.940
 what would you do for your sleep and wakefulness?

1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:22.440
 You could put a comment on YouTube, which I hope you'll do,

1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:24.080
 but if I were hit by a bus and killed,

1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:26.800
 then I wouldn't be able to answer your question.

1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:29.720
 So know your temperature minimum.

1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:32.840
 Understand light in the early part of the day is valuable.

1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:34.000
 Light when you want to be awake,

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:35.640
 provided it's not so bright, it's damaging.

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.340
 It's great for you whether or not it comes from screens

1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:39.320
 or sunlight, but sunlight's better.

1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:42.200
 Avoid light in the four to six hours

1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:43.560
 before your temperature minimum

1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:45.000
 or else you're going to delay your clock

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:48.040
 unless you're traveling and that's what you want to do.

1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:49.480
 Okay, use temperature,

1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:51.980
 increased temperature to shift your clock,

1:45:51.980 --> 1:45:54.800
 decreased temperature to delay your clock.

1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:58.120
 Okay, map out your temperature and understand it.

1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:00.960
 You don't have to know degree by degree across the day.

1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:03.040
 Know your minimum, know your maximum temperature

1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:04.200
 in your 24 hour cycle

1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.120
 and you will feel great power through that

1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:10.600
 because then you'll know also about these ultradian cycles,

1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:13.360
 these 90 minute cycles within which you can do focused work.

1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:15.000
 Don't expect the focus to come early,

1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.120
 expect the focus to come in the middle

1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:18.120
 and then kind of taper off.

1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:19.240
 Talked a little bit about kids,

1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:21.120
 a little bit about elderly, about parenting.

1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:22.160
 We are going to continue.

1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:25.680
 There's going to be more, but now shift workers, travelers,

1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:27.760
 people that are jet-lacking themselves at home,

1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:30.580
 you now have levers in place.

1:46:30.580 --> 1:46:31.980
 Information can be powerful,

1:46:31.980 --> 1:46:34.360
 but you have to implement it in ways,

1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:36.460
 obviously safe ways and reasonable ways,

1:46:36.460 --> 1:46:38.460
 but implementing this knowledge

1:46:38.460 --> 1:46:41.320
 in the ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you

1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:43.420
 is going to be the way that you can develop

1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:45.560
 a bit of a laboratory about yourself.

1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:49.080
 I loathe the term biohacking, sorry biohackers.

1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:50.660
 I don't believe in hacking anything.

1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:52.240
 I believe in understanding mechanism

1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:54.380
 and applying the principles of mechanism

1:46:54.380 --> 1:46:56.280
 for which there are large bodies

1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.320
 of quality peer reviewed data

1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:00.400
 and even a whole center of mass

1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:02.240
 around certain biological principles

1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:04.820
 like the effects of light and temperature minimums

1:47:04.820 --> 1:47:07.240
 that will allow you to shift your biology

1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:08.440
 in the ways that you want it to go,

1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:10.420
 that will allow you to shift your psychology

1:47:10.420 --> 1:47:12.520
 in the ways you want it to go.

1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:14.560
 Next podcast episode,

1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:17.820
 we are going to talk more about a few things.

1:47:17.820 --> 1:47:20.120
 First of all, we're going to answer more of your questions

1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:21.240
 because during office hours,

1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:22.480
 I didn't get to all your questions

1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:24.580
 from the previous episode.

1:47:24.580 --> 1:47:27.720
 So I do read the comments and we're paying attention

1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:29.680
 and figuring out the most common questions.

1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:31.360
 We are going to get to some of the harder topics.

1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:33.680
 Someone came at me, it's always fun when somebody does this,

1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:35.760
 and they say, well, these are just the kind of

1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:37.000
 basal low-level questions.

1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:38.020
 What about the big stuff?

1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:40.560
 What about dreaming and lucid dreaming and consciousness?

1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:42.420
 Look, I'll talk about that stuff.

1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:44.160
 And I'm planning to do that,

1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:45.360
 some of which in the next episode

1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:47.340
 and the following episode maybe even.

1:47:47.340 --> 1:47:49.880
 But I want to give you data.

1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:52.320
 I want to give you things that are supported by data.

1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:56.680
 So I will try to speculate as little as possible

1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:59.040
 because this is a podcast about science

1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:01.160
 and science-based tools for everyday life.

1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.740
 This is not about me speculating.

1:48:03.740 --> 1:48:04.840
 Many people have speculated

1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:06.800
 about the role of sleep, dreaming, and consciousness.

1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:11.160
 Fascinating topics and a rather circular argument, frankly.

1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:12.800
 It's been going on for centuries.

1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:14.080
 Someday we'll get there.

1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:15.300
 Right now, we're concentrating

1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:17.020
 on these deep biological mechanisms

1:48:17.020 --> 1:48:18.400
 that make you who you are

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:21.460
 and allow you to feel certain ways, good or bad,

1:48:21.460 --> 1:48:25.040
 allow you to function physically in certain ways,

1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:27.720
 good or bad, and give you more of a sense of control.

1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:29.200
 That's my goal here.

1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.220
 Many people have quite graciously asked

1:48:31.220 --> 1:48:33.800
 how they can help support the podcast.

1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:35.000
 First of all, thank you.

1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.780
 We appreciate the question.

1:48:36.780 --> 1:48:38.380
 You can support the podcast

1:48:38.380 --> 1:48:41.620
 by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube,

1:48:41.620 --> 1:48:45.040
 as well as subscribing on Apple or Spotify.

1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:47.280
 And you can also leave us comments

1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:50.320
 and feedback on YouTube and at Apple.

1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:51.480
 That really helps.

1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:53.300
 We would hope the feedback would be positive,

1:48:53.300 --> 1:48:56.140
 but nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions.

1:48:56.140 --> 1:48:57.480
 We will use those questions

1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:00.280
 to create future content for the podcast.

1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:02.120
 As well, if you can recommend the podcast

1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:03.880
 to friends and family and other people

1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:05.760
 that you think might find the information of use,

1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:07.020
 that's terrific.

1:49:07.020 --> 1:49:08.440
 And check out our sponsors

1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:10.040
 that we mentioned at the beginning.

1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:12.500
 That's a really great way to help support us

1:49:12.500 --> 1:49:15.020
 and our ability to bring you this information.

1:49:15.020 --> 1:49:17.720
 Along those lines, a lot of people have asked me

1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:21.480
 about supplements and supplement companies.

1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:25.360
 So up until now, I've been reluctant

1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:27.760
 to recommend specific supplement brands.

1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:30.980
 The supplement industry is kind of a Wild West

1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:33.600
 of different brands, different levels of quality

1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:35.280
 and stringency.

1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:37.080
 It can be very complicated.

1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:40.040
 And what's on the bottle is not always what you're getting.

1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:42.000
 The quality of what you're getting varies

1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:42.900
 from company to company,

1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:45.980
 and even from substance to substance, batch to batch.

1:49:45.980 --> 1:49:50.000
 So I'm pleased to say that I'm partnering with Thorne.

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.140
 Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:56.840
 is a supplement company that works with the Mayo Clinic

1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:00.140
 and with pretty much all the major sports team organizations

1:50:00.140 --> 1:50:03.680
 and that I know to have the highest levels of stringency

1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:06.440
 in terms of what's in the bottle matches

1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:08.680
 what's listed on the bottle

1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:10.040
 and in terms of the quality

1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:12.160
 of what they put in those supplements.

1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:14.460
 So while I mentioned earlier

1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:16.200
 that supplements aren't for everybody,

1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:18.340
 if you're interested in trying some of these supplements,

1:50:18.340 --> 1:50:20.120
 you might want to check out Thorne.

1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:23.560
 If you want to do that, you can go to thorne.com

1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:27.100
 slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:31.720
 So it's T-H-O-R-N-E dot com,

1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:36.020
 C-O-M slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:50:36.020 --> 1:50:38.720
 And if you do that, they'll give you 20% off

1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:39.760
 any of the supplements

1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:42.040
 that you happen to purchase from Thorne.

1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:43.680
 Thanks so much for your time and attention.

1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:45.020
 I really appreciate it.

1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:47.840
 See you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:50.680
 And as always, thanks for your interest in science.
