00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.160 --> 00:15.240
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.000
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.000 --> 00:18.640
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.900
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:20.900 --> 00:22.980
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:22.980 --> 00:25.240
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.240 --> 00:26.880
 to the general public.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.120
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.120 --> 00:31.240
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.280
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.040
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses,

00:36.040 --> 00:37.960
 and I'm delighted that they're a partner

00:37.960 --> 00:40.040
 and a sponsor for the podcast.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.860
 As some of you may already know,

00:41.860 --> 00:44.960
 I've spent two decades or more studying the visual system,

00:44.960 --> 00:48.480
 how we see vision is absolutely the most important sense

00:48.480 --> 00:51.000
 by which humans navigate the world and survive,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.220
 and our eyes as two pieces of our brain

00:53.220 --> 00:55.440
 do many other important things as well.

00:55.440 --> 00:58.420
 So taking good care of our eyesight is essential.

00:58.420 --> 01:01.260
 Founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,

01:01.260 --> 01:04.320
 Roca was born out of an obsession for performance.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.840
 They've carefully put science and purpose

01:05.840 --> 01:07.180
 behind their design choices,

01:07.180 --> 01:10.200
 and they've built absolutely terrific products as a result.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
 The glasses are amazing.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.940
 I love them because they look great,

01:13.940 --> 01:15.260
 they are super comfortable,

01:15.260 --> 01:18.160
 and the optical clarity is incredible.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.000
 They filter out sunlight in a way

01:20.000 --> 01:22.320
 that still allows you to see contrast and shadows

01:22.320 --> 01:23.320
 the way you need to.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.960
 For me, one of the things that's really irritating

01:24.960 --> 01:26.680
 is if I have a pair of sunglasses

01:26.680 --> 01:29.660
 that don't allow me to see all the things I want to see.

01:29.660 --> 01:33.180
 And with Roca glasses, I get incredible contrast,

01:33.180 --> 01:36.040
 but then I can also relax and be outdoors in bright light.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.560
 And as the amount of light changes with cloud cover

01:38.560 --> 01:39.940
 and things of that sort,

01:39.940 --> 01:41.520
 my ability to see my surroundings

01:41.520 --> 01:43.440
 is still really sharp and really clear.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.480
 And that only comes from really understanding

01:45.480 --> 01:46.880
 how the visual system works

01:46.880 --> 01:49.600
 and how it adjusts to contrast and adaptation

01:49.600 --> 01:50.440
 and all these different things.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.120
 They really understand the science,

01:52.120 --> 01:54.640
 and that went into the design of these glasses.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.080
 And as many of you know,

01:56.080 --> 01:57.920
 sunlight and the viewing of light

01:57.920 --> 02:00.720
 is also very important for setting circadian rhythms.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.080
 So that's also been incorporated

02:02.080 --> 02:04.720
 into the design and science behind these glasses.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.860
 I do wear readers.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.840
 I don't often wear them during the podcast,

02:07.840 --> 02:10.080
 but I have to wear reading glasses at night.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.040
 So I use their readers

02:11.040 --> 02:12.960
 and I own a pair of their sunglasses,

02:12.960 --> 02:14.720
 and I'm delighted with them.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.620

02:29.280 --> 02:32.760
 Today's podcast is also brought to you by Inside Tracker.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.220
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

02:35.220 --> 02:37.680
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

02:37.680 --> 02:39.200
 to help you better understand your body

02:39.200 --> 02:41.060
 and reach your health goals.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.840
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done

02:43.840 --> 02:47.200
 for the simple reason that many of the important things

02:47.200 --> 02:50.520
 that are vital to our immediate and long-term health

02:50.520 --> 02:54.280
 can only be detected in a good quality blood test.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.300
 The problem with blood tests is that most blood tests,

02:57.300 --> 02:59.260
 you get a lot of information back about levels

02:59.260 --> 03:00.920
 that are too high or too low of this thing

03:00.920 --> 03:03.160
 or the other thing, but making sense of that

03:03.160 --> 03:05.600
 and what to do with that information is very challenging.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.140
 Even if you have a really attentive physician,

03:08.140 --> 03:09.880
 oftentimes it's mysterious

03:09.880 --> 03:11.800
 as to what to do with all this data.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.520
 With Inside Tracker, they make it very easy to understand

03:14.520 --> 03:17.980
 what all the metabolic factors, hormone factors, et cetera,

03:17.980 --> 03:21.040
 mean for you and what to do about those markers.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.640
 So they offer you directives

03:22.640 --> 03:25.440
 in terms of nutrition, supplementation,

03:25.440 --> 03:29.020
 as well as lifestyle factors like exercise, sleep, et cetera,

03:29.020 --> 03:31.440
 that can allow you to take control of those numbers

03:31.440 --> 03:34.240
 and bring them into the ranges that are best for you

03:34.240 --> 03:35.880
 and your long-term health.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.600
 Another feature of Inside Tracker that's great

03:37.600 --> 03:39.440
 is their inner age test.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.500
 This test shows you what your biological age

03:41.500 --> 03:43.680
 and how it compares to your chronological age,

03:43.680 --> 03:46.700
 which I can only imagine most everybody, including me,

03:46.700 --> 03:49.000
 are extremely interested in, how long am I likely to live?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.480
 How old am I really in terms of my biology?

03:52.480 --> 03:54.060
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:02.920 --> 04:06.080
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.720
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:07.720 --> 04:10.240
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.840
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

04:12.840 --> 04:16.000
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.720
 With Athletic Greens, you get a ton of factors

04:18.720 --> 04:19.720
 that are good for you,

04:19.720 --> 04:22.160
 mixed into this one really good tasting drink.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.600
 I like to mix mine with water

04:23.600 --> 04:25.000
 and a little bit of lemon juice,

04:25.000 --> 04:26.860
 and I drink that once or twice a day,

04:26.860 --> 04:28.720
 typically once early in the day,

04:28.720 --> 04:31.500
 and sometimes also in the afternoon or even evening.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.640
 I'm able to sleep after drinking in the evening just fine.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.360
 The reason I've been using Athletic Greens for so long

04:37.360 --> 04:40.000
 that I continue to use Athletic Greens is that,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.560
 one, I feel better when I take it, I just do.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.920
 Psychologically, physically, I feel better,

04:44.920 --> 04:48.400
 but also it covers all my bases of the things that I need

04:48.400 --> 04:49.800
 for my general health.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.460
 It's sort of a foundational supplement,

04:51.460 --> 04:52.480
 as I like to call it.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.400
 In fact, when people ask me, what should I take?

04:55.400 --> 04:58.160
 If I were to recommend just one supplement that people take,

04:58.160 --> 04:59.980
 it would be Athletic Greens.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.640
 With Athletic Greens, you get support for your gut,

05:02.640 --> 05:04.980
 which is important because the gut microbiome

05:04.980 --> 05:06.580
 is important for the gut brain access,

05:06.580 --> 05:08.800
 for mood, metabolism, hormones, et cetera.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.440
 There are so many data that support that statement.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.840
 As well, there are many factors in Athletic Greens

05:14.840 --> 05:17.800
 that support general health, metabolism, endocrine factors,

05:17.800 --> 05:19.520
 immunity, et cetera.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.020
 So with Athletic Greens, I drink it once or twice a day,

05:22.020 --> 05:24.180
 and I know that I've got all that covered.

05:24.180 --> 05:25.640
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:25.640 --> 05:28.800
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.160
 And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.960
 They'll send you five free travel packs

05:32.960 --> 05:37.520
 plus a year supply, excuse me, of vitamin D3 and K2.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.600
 So you get the five free travel packs

05:39.600 --> 05:40.920
 and a year supply of D3.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.040
 If you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

05:44.040 --> 05:45.800
 you can claim that special offer.

05:45.800 --> 05:49.380
 For the last month, four episodes to be exact,

05:49.380 --> 05:51.520
 we've been discussing physical performance

05:51.520 --> 05:53.440
 and skill learning.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.060
 We've talked about how to learn skills faster,

05:56.060 --> 05:59.080
 whether or not those are skills for athletic performance,

05:59.080 --> 06:02.200
 dance, music, things of that sort.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.440
 We've also talked about how to gain strength

06:04.440 --> 06:08.000
 and how to lose fat faster by leveraging the nervous system.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.320
 Things like shiver and non-shiver,

06:11.320 --> 06:14.460
 non-exercise activity-induced thermogenesis.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.720
 We talked about how neurons can actually

06:16.720 --> 06:19.160
 trigger accelerated fat loss.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.440
 We talked about hypertrophy, also called muscle growth.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.240
 And we covered everything from sets and reps, protocols,

06:26.240 --> 06:29.360
 how long to stay in a cold ice bath, when to get out,

06:29.360 --> 06:30.720
 how to keep shivering.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.720
 We've covered a lot of tools and a lot of science.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.080
 So if you're interested in those things

06:35.080 --> 06:37.720
 and you even perhaps want to learn a little bit

06:37.720 --> 06:41.360
 about how we make energy, ATP, from carbohydrates

06:41.360 --> 06:45.320
 or from fats, it's all covered in the previous four episodes.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.580
 This was going to be the time

06:46.580 --> 06:49.540
 that we move to a new topic entirely,

06:49.540 --> 06:51.600
 but we are going to do one more episode

06:51.600 --> 06:53.840
 in this series on physical performance

06:53.840 --> 06:57.560
 for the simple reason that you asked many questions

06:57.560 --> 06:59.720
 about something that's vitally important,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.040
 both for physical performance

07:01.040 --> 07:05.920
 and long-term and short-term health, and that's endurance.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.880
 And so today we are going to talk about endurance.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.820
 Now, if you're a strength athlete

07:10.820 --> 07:14.360
 or you're not interested in endurance,

07:14.360 --> 07:15.680
 don't depart just yet,

07:15.680 --> 07:18.620
 because it turns out that there are ways to train endurance

07:18.620 --> 07:20.400
 that are very different

07:20.400 --> 07:23.280
 than I would have previously imagined.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.480
 If you only think about long runs, long swims,

07:26.480 --> 07:29.760
 marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks,

07:29.760 --> 07:31.700
 and that sort of thing puts you to sleep,

07:31.700 --> 07:33.000
 kind of like Costello is snoring

07:33.000 --> 07:34.760
 in the background right now.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.260
 He's not a long distance endurance athlete, that's for sure.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.000
 If you're interested in those things,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.520
 or if you are averse to those things,

07:43.520 --> 07:45.360
 I encourage you to continue listening,

07:45.360 --> 07:48.280
 because we are going to talk about a little bit of science

07:48.280 --> 07:50.140
 and then some specific protocols

07:50.140 --> 07:52.600
 that really define what endurance is,

07:52.600 --> 07:54.200
 the four types of endurance,

07:54.200 --> 07:56.860
 and ways to train those in concert

07:56.860 --> 07:58.960
 with the other things that you might be doing,

07:58.960 --> 08:03.320
 like weight training or skill training or yoga.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.340
 And if you are an endurance athlete,

08:05.340 --> 08:08.280
 we are going to cover a lot of tools and science

08:08.280 --> 08:11.080
 that I'm certain will also help enhance your training

08:11.080 --> 08:15.440
 and performance in races or even just recreationally.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.480
 The topic of endurance,

08:17.480 --> 08:22.120
 I think has been badly misrepresented, frankly, online.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.160
 And when you start digging into the science

08:24.160 --> 08:27.240
 and you start talking to real experts in this area,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.120
 what you discover, what I've discovered,

08:29.120 --> 08:31.360
 is that it's an incredibly interesting area

08:31.360 --> 08:33.320
 because it teaches us so much

08:33.320 --> 08:37.840
 about how our body and our brain use fuels

08:37.840 --> 08:40.200
 and how we can control which fuels

08:40.200 --> 08:42.520
 are used by our body and brain.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.960
 So today we will talk about the four kinds of endurance.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.840
 We will also cover the topic of hydration,

08:48.840 --> 08:51.520
 which might sound incredibly boring,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.360
 like, okay, just drink more water.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.920
 But it's really interesting

08:54.920 --> 08:57.560
 because not only is hydration

08:57.560 --> 08:59.480
 a limiting factor on performance,

08:59.480 --> 09:02.120
 but there is a right way to hydrate

09:02.120 --> 09:04.200
 and there is a wrong way to hydrate.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.320
 There actually is a formula that I'll teach you

09:06.320 --> 09:09.800
 to know how much water to be drinking,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.300
 depending on your activity levels.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.800
 And if that sounds like a simple thing,

09:13.800 --> 09:17.040
 like, oh, just tap off water until your urine runs clear,

09:17.040 --> 09:19.360
 that's actually the wrong advice.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.400
 It turns out that if you don't hydrate properly,

09:21.400 --> 09:24.400
 you can see 20 to 30% reductions in performance,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.000
 whether or not that's strength,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.540
 whether or not that's increasing hypertrophy,

09:28.540 --> 09:30.280
 whether or not that's running, swimming,

09:30.280 --> 09:32.120
 even mental performance.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.700
 So even if you're not an athlete

09:33.700 --> 09:35.440
 or a recreational athlete at all,

09:35.440 --> 09:38.880
 I encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.740
 So we're going to cover as usual a little bit of science,

09:41.740 --> 09:43.980
 and then we're going to dive right into protocols

09:43.980 --> 09:45.600
 that you can apply if you like,

09:45.600 --> 09:48.900
 and if you deem those correct and safe for you.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.160
 Before we dive into all that,

09:50.160 --> 09:51.640
 I want to make an important announcement,

09:51.640 --> 09:54.840
 which is all the episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast

09:54.840 --> 09:57.380
 are now housed on a single website,

09:57.380 --> 09:59.880
 which is hubermanlab.com.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.680
 If you go to hubermanlab.com,

10:01.680 --> 10:04.580
 you can find all the episodes in YouTube, Apple,

10:04.580 --> 10:07.080
 and Spotify format with links there.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.840
 The website is also searchable.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.720
 So if you go into the little search function,

10:10.720 --> 10:11.840
 which you'll find very easily,

10:11.840 --> 10:15.460
 and you put in, for instance, creatine or sleep

10:15.460 --> 10:17.680
 or ice bath or sauna,

10:17.680 --> 10:20.620
 it will take you to the specific episodes

10:20.620 --> 10:22.960
 that contain that information.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.360
 And in addition, if you go to the website, hubermanlab.com,

10:26.360 --> 10:28.480
 you have the opportunity to sign up

10:28.480 --> 10:31.660
 for what we call the Huberman Lab Neural Network.

10:31.660 --> 10:34.560
 The Huberman Lab Neural Network is a zero cost resource

10:34.560 --> 10:37.380
 where once a month, perhaps more often,

10:37.380 --> 10:40.280
 you'll receive a email newsletter,

10:40.280 --> 10:43.280
 and that newsletter will contain specific protocols,

10:43.280 --> 10:45.840
 announcements, attachments of PDFs

10:45.840 --> 10:48.680
 and things of that sort of protocols, tools,

10:48.680 --> 10:50.960
 and science from the podcast.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.160
 We will also make any announcements about live lectures,

10:55.160 --> 10:56.920
 which at some point I'll probably start doing

10:56.920 --> 10:58.560
 in various cities in the US

10:58.560 --> 11:00.520
 and probably around the world as well,

11:00.520 --> 11:01.800
 as well as other things

11:01.800 --> 11:03.440
 that I think would be really useful to you,

11:03.440 --> 11:05.720
 all of course at zero cost.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.540
 So that's hubermanlab.com.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.980
 Sign up for the neural network newsletter.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.560
 You can find that in the menu tab

11:11.560 --> 11:13.440
 or it might pop up when you get there.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.000
 And I hope you will join.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.960
 And as a final announcement,

11:16.960 --> 11:19.580
 if you're not already following us on Instagram,

11:19.580 --> 11:21.680
 you can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.920
 And if you do that, I often make announcements

11:23.920 --> 11:26.120
 and release protocols and links to protocols

11:26.120 --> 11:28.320
 and things there as well.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.720
 I briefly want to touch on something

11:29.720 --> 11:31.800
 from the previous episode,

11:31.800 --> 11:33.880
 which is that if you are somebody

11:33.880 --> 11:37.480
 that is trying to increase muscle strength and or size,

11:37.480 --> 11:39.240
 or if you're simply somebody

11:39.240 --> 11:42.480
 who doesn't want to increase muscle strength and size,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.920
 and you just want to maintain the musculature that you have,

11:45.920 --> 11:48.660
 it's vital that you perform at least five sets

11:48.660 --> 11:52.240
 of resistance training per muscle per week.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.160
 If we don't do that, we lose muscle over time.

11:55.160 --> 11:59.000
 And that is one reason among many

11:59.000 --> 12:02.720
 to have a regular resistance training protocol.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.320
 Nobody wants to start resembling a folded over envelope

12:06.320 --> 12:08.280
 or a melted candle.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.740
 No one wants to have challenges getting up out of a chair

12:10.740 --> 12:12.280
 or off the ground.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.240
 Maintaining musculature is vital,

12:14.240 --> 12:16.000
 not just to our immediate health,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.760
 but to our long-term health trajectory.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.400
 So I just want to emphasize that point.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.680
 If you're curious about the sets, the reps,

12:22.680 --> 12:25.520
 how close to failure to go or not go,

12:25.520 --> 12:27.080
 whether or not you should be

12:27.080 --> 12:29.080
 doing your cardiovascular training

12:29.080 --> 12:30.680
 before or after your weight training,

12:30.680 --> 12:32.600
 all of that is in the previous episode,

12:32.600 --> 12:33.800
 right down to the details.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.160
 And I like to think it made simple for you to understand.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.840
 But I do strongly believe that resistance training,

12:39.840 --> 12:43.200
 whether or not it's with body weight or bands or weights,

12:43.200 --> 12:46.880
 or simply lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard,

12:46.880 --> 12:50.200
 is vital for our systemic physiology

12:50.200 --> 12:51.280
 and our overall health.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.840
 And that includes our brain health.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.160
 And I described the reasons for that

12:54.160 --> 12:56.580
 and the mechanisms in the previous episode.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.760
 Today, I'd like to talk about endurance

12:58.760 --> 13:02.940
 and how to build endurance and how to use endurance

13:02.940 --> 13:05.220
 for the health of your entire body.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.480
 Endurance, as the name suggests,

13:08.480 --> 13:12.760
 is our ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise

13:12.760 --> 13:17.760
 or continuous movement or continuous effort of any kind.

13:17.760 --> 13:22.760
 And I do believe that our ability to engage in activities

13:23.480 --> 13:25.820
 that we call endurance training

13:25.820 --> 13:28.200
 or physical endurance activities

13:28.200 --> 13:33.020
 do have carry over to mental performance

13:33.020 --> 13:36.280
 of things that require long-term effort.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.580
 I'll touch on that at the end

13:37.580 --> 13:39.600
 and why there's reason to believe

13:39.600 --> 13:41.560
 that there's a biological crossover

13:41.560 --> 13:43.560
 between those two things.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.920
 I don't think it's simply the case

13:44.920 --> 13:46.600
 that if you train yourself to be a strength

13:46.600 --> 13:49.060
 and speed athlete and to do short bouts of exercise,

13:49.060 --> 13:50.220
 they're very intense,

13:50.220 --> 13:52.520
 that you can only do mental work

13:52.520 --> 13:55.520
 that's of short bouts and very intense.

13:55.520 --> 14:00.520
 But it is clear that cardiovascular exercise,

14:00.520 --> 14:02.560
 exercise where you're getting your heart rate up

14:02.560 --> 14:04.280
 continuously for a period of time

14:04.280 --> 14:05.740
 and endurance exercise,

14:05.740 --> 14:07.880
 we will define what that is in a moment,

14:07.880 --> 14:12.380
 is vital for tapping into and enhancing various aspects

14:12.380 --> 14:16.000
 of our biology in the body and in the brain

14:16.000 --> 14:19.600
 such that our brain can perform work

14:19.600 --> 14:21.080
 for longer periods of time,

14:21.080 --> 14:23.920
 focused work, learning, et cetera.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.480
 So I want to dive into the topic of endurance

14:26.480 --> 14:30.200
 and I want to just begin by addressing something

14:30.200 --> 14:33.000
 that's vital to any kind of effort,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.180
 whether or not it's mental effort or physical effort.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.640
 So as always a little bit of science

14:36.640 --> 14:38.840
 and then we'll get right into protocols.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.440
 So the key thing to understand

14:41.440 --> 14:43.540
 about energy production in the body,

14:43.540 --> 14:45.080
 meaning your ability to think,

14:45.080 --> 14:46.320
 your ability to talk,

14:46.320 --> 14:47.500
 your ability to walk,

14:47.500 --> 14:49.280
 your ability to run,

14:49.280 --> 14:52.040
 is this thing that we call ATP.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.040
 ATP and mitochondria,

14:55.040 --> 14:59.080
 which are just little what we call organelles within cells,

14:59.080 --> 15:02.380
 these little factories that make energy, if you will,

15:04.040 --> 15:08.000
 ATP is required for anything that requires energy,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.880
 for anything that you do that requires effort.

15:10.880 --> 15:15.300
 And there are different ways to get ATP.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.840
 And we have been gifted as a species

15:18.840 --> 15:23.840
 with the ability to convert lots of things into ATP.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.680
 We can convert carbohydrates,

15:26.680 --> 15:28.040
 literally the kinds of carbohydrates.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.760
 You eat a bagel, you eat a piece of pizza.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.720
 Pizza usually has dough and it has cheese

15:32.720 --> 15:34.360
 and some other things.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.720
 Costello here is me talking about pizza.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.320
 Costello loves pizza by the way.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.400
 Eating a piece of pizza,

15:39.400 --> 15:42.040
 it gets converted into various things,

15:42.040 --> 15:44.720
 fatty acids from the fats,

15:44.720 --> 15:46.960
 glucose from the bread,

15:46.960 --> 15:51.960
 and those things get converted into ATP within cells

15:52.360 --> 15:53.960
 through things like glycolysis,

15:53.960 --> 15:55.240
 things like lipolysis.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.240
 I talked about this in previous episodes.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.460
 So our muscles and our neurons

16:00.460 --> 16:04.140
 use different fuel sources to generate ATP.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.280
 The ones that are used first

16:07.280 --> 16:09.240
 for short bouts of intense activity

16:09.240 --> 16:10.880
 are things like phosphocreatine.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.880
 If you've only heard about creatine as a supplement,

16:12.880 --> 16:15.640
 well, phosphocreatine actually exists on our muscles.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.880
 And that's why people take creatine.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.120
 You can load your muscles with more creatine.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.680
 And excuse me, phosphocreatine is great

16:23.680 --> 16:26.520
 for short, intense bouts of effort.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.840
 So when you're really pushing hard on something physical,

16:28.840 --> 16:30.800
 let's say you see a car on the side of the road

16:30.800 --> 16:32.840
 and that car is stalled and the person says,

16:32.840 --> 16:34.160
 hey, can you help me push my car?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.320
 And you start to push,

16:35.320 --> 16:36.520
 that's going to be phosphocreatine

16:36.520 --> 16:38.280
 is going to be your main fuel source.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.940
 Then you start to tap into things like glucose,

16:40.940 --> 16:42.700
 which is literally just carbohydrate,

16:42.700 --> 16:44.780
 it's just sugar that's in your blood.

16:44.780 --> 16:47.000
 And then if you keep pushing on that car,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.560
 you keep in engaging in a particular effort

16:49.560 --> 16:52.560
 or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast,

16:52.560 --> 16:54.960
 you start to tap into other fuel sources

16:54.960 --> 16:56.300
 like glycogen from your liver,

16:56.300 --> 16:58.400
 which is just, it's like a little pack,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.540
 just like you might've packed a sandwich

17:00.540 --> 17:02.360
 or something for work.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.580
 You have a little pack of glycogen in your liver

17:05.580 --> 17:07.200
 that you can rely on.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.880
 And you have fats stored in adipose tissue.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.100
 Even if you have very, very low body fat percentage,

17:13.100 --> 17:14.440
 like you're one of these people

17:14.440 --> 17:16.480
 who has like 3% or 5% body fat,

17:16.480 --> 17:20.280
 really thin skin, very little body fat,

17:20.280 --> 17:24.860
 you can extract lipids, fatty acids from that body fat.

17:24.860 --> 17:26.040
 It's like a storage pack.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.680
 It is a storage pack for energy

17:27.680 --> 17:29.460
 that can be converted to ATP.

17:29.460 --> 17:33.080
 So without going into any more detail,

17:33.080 --> 17:35.980
 when I say today energy, or I say ATP,

17:35.980 --> 17:39.720
 just remember that regardless of your diet,

17:39.720 --> 17:41.880
 regardless of your nutritional plan,

17:41.880 --> 17:45.760
 your body has the capacity to use creatine,

17:45.760 --> 17:48.240
 glucose, glycogen, lipids,

17:48.240 --> 17:50.800
 and if you're ketogenic, ketones.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.640
 We'll talk about ketosis in order to generate fuel energy.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.080
 Now, the other crucial point

17:59.080 --> 18:01.860
 is that in order to complete that process

18:01.860 --> 18:04.640
 of taking these fuels and converting them into energy,

18:04.640 --> 18:08.920
 most of the time you need oxygen.

18:09.780 --> 18:12.300
 You need air basically in your system.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.380
 Now, it's not actual air.

18:13.380 --> 18:16.460
 You need oxygen molecules in your system,

18:16.460 --> 18:18.340
 comes in through your mouth and your nose,

18:18.340 --> 18:22.100
 goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.740
 Oxygen is not a fuel,

18:24.740 --> 18:27.860
 but like a fire that has no oxygen,

18:27.860 --> 18:29.900
 you can't actually burn the logs,

18:29.900 --> 18:34.180
 but when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire,

18:34.180 --> 18:37.520
 basically onto logs with a flame there,

18:37.520 --> 18:41.220
 then basically it will take fire, it will burn.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.140
 Oxygen allows you to burn fuel.

18:45.140 --> 18:49.060
 So today we are going to ask the critical questions.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.780
 What allows us to perform?

18:51.780 --> 18:55.940
 What allows us to continue effort for long periods of time?

18:55.940 --> 18:58.700
 And that effort could be a run, it could be a swim,

18:58.700 --> 19:00.160
 it could be studying,

19:00.160 --> 19:04.580
 it could be anything that extends over a long period of time.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.340
 Well, you're going to need energy

19:06.340 --> 19:08.500
 and you're going to need oxygen.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.920
 But the way to answer a question,

19:10.920 --> 19:14.340
 like what allows us to endure, right?

19:14.340 --> 19:17.680
 Endurance, what allows us to keep going?

19:17.680 --> 19:19.660
 Well, we think of things like willpower,

19:19.660 --> 19:20.500
 but what's willpower?

19:20.500 --> 19:23.940
 Willpower is neurons, it's neurons in our brain.

19:23.940 --> 19:25.560
 We have this thing called the central governor,

19:25.560 --> 19:28.580
 which decides whether or not we should or could continue

19:28.580 --> 19:31.120
 or whether or not we should stop,

19:31.120 --> 19:33.520
 whether or not we should quit, okay?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.680
 So whether or not you're somebody who has a lot

19:35.680 --> 19:37.460
 of what we would call resilience and endurance,

19:37.460 --> 19:39.940
 or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early

19:39.940 --> 19:42.160
 and quits early or can't handle frustration,

19:42.160 --> 19:44.420
 that has to do with your fuel utilization

19:44.420 --> 19:45.760
 in specific neurons.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.920
 So we have to ask the question,

19:47.920 --> 19:51.280
 what is the limiting factor on performance, right?

19:51.280 --> 19:53.780
 So instead of saying, what allows us to endure,

19:53.780 --> 19:56.540
 we should say, what prevents us from enduring?

19:56.540 --> 19:58.500
 What prevents us from moving forward?

19:58.500 --> 20:01.200
 What are the factors that say, you know what?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.760
 No more, I'm not going to continue this run.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.040
 Or you know what?

20:05.040 --> 20:07.000
 I've had a really long, hard day,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
 or maybe I've had an easy day or I'm feeling lazy,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.600
 I just don't even really feel like getting up and moving.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.840
 So what we're going to talk about today

20:12.840 --> 20:15.720
 actually gets right down to the heart of motivation

20:15.720 --> 20:19.440
 and fuel use, motivation and fuel allocation.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.240
 And we are going to talk about specific training protocols

20:22.240 --> 20:25.640
 that you can follow that have carry over

20:25.640 --> 20:29.180
 between the bodily systems of running, swimming, et cetera,

20:29.180 --> 20:31.320
 and the way that your brain works.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.840
 So let's talk about endurance by asking first,

20:33.840 --> 20:36.840
 what are the limiting factors on endurance?

20:36.840 --> 20:38.620
 What stops us?

20:38.620 --> 20:40.880
 Because in addressing that and answering that,

20:40.880 --> 20:44.740
 we will understand what allows us to get into effort

20:44.740 --> 20:46.320
 and to continue effort.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.120
 There are five main categories of things

20:49.120 --> 20:51.800
 that allow us to engage in effort.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.800
 And they are neurons, nerves, muscle, muscle,

20:58.220 --> 21:03.220
 blood, things in our blood, our heart, and our lungs.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.920
 Now, I don't want to completely write off things

21:06.920 --> 21:09.960
 like the immune system and other systems of the body,

21:09.960 --> 21:13.280
 but nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs

21:13.280 --> 21:15.320
 are the five that I want to focus on today

21:15.320 --> 21:18.960
 because that's where most of the data are.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.240
 As we go forward into this,

21:20.240 --> 21:23.120
 I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,

21:23.120 --> 21:25.420
 who, as with the last episode,

21:25.420 --> 21:28.100
 has been tremendously helpful and informative

21:28.100 --> 21:30.020
 in terms of the exercise physiology.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.920
 He's a true expert.

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
 He has a laboratory.

21:32.920 --> 21:37.420
 He's a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy,

21:37.420 --> 21:38.780
 who understands the science,

21:38.780 --> 21:40.880
 but who also works with athletes

21:40.880 --> 21:43.120
 and works with recreational athletes,

21:43.120 --> 21:44.040
 professional athletes,

21:44.040 --> 21:46.520
 really understands at a variety of levels

21:46.520 --> 21:47.720
 how all these systems work.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.960
 He's the person I consulted with about today's episode,

21:50.960 --> 21:52.820
 although I did access other literature as well.

21:52.820 --> 21:55.360
 And I'm going to mention a key review

21:55.360 --> 21:56.740
 for any of you aficionados

21:56.740 --> 21:58.480
 who really want to get down into the weeds.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.320
 But I encourage you, if you want more detail,

22:01.320 --> 22:04.240
 to check out Dr. Andy Galpin's YouTube page.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.840
 I think he's also on Twitter.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.680
 He's definitely on Instagram.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.880
 His content is excellent, and he really understands.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.140
 I have learned, and I really believe,

22:13.140 --> 22:16.960
 that an intellectual is somebody who understands a topic

22:16.960 --> 22:20.280
 at multiple levels of specificity of detail

22:20.280 --> 22:21.560
 and can communicate that.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.480
 And Andy is a true intellectual

22:24.480 --> 22:26.760
 of muscle physiology and performance.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.560
 And if you hear the word intellectual

22:28.560 --> 22:30.720
 and you kind of back up and cringe from that,

22:30.720 --> 22:33.020
 understand that he's also a practitioner.

22:33.020 --> 22:36.280
 So thank you, Andrew Galpin, Andy Galpin,

22:37.680 --> 22:40.420
 for your support in these episodes.

22:40.420 --> 22:44.240
 And we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.160
 So nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.840
 Let's talk about neurons and how they work, okay?

22:48.840 --> 22:51.120
 But I want to tell you about an experiment

22:51.120 --> 22:53.840
 that's going to make it very clear

22:53.840 --> 22:58.300
 why quitting is a mental thing, not a physical thing.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.960
 So why do we quit?

22:59.960 --> 23:02.560
 Well, an experiment was done a couple of years ago

23:02.560 --> 23:04.120
 and was published in the journal Cell,

23:04.120 --> 23:06.440
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,

23:06.440 --> 23:10.300
 showing that there is a class of neurons

23:10.300 --> 23:13.640
 in our brainstem, in the back of our brain,

23:13.640 --> 23:18.040
 that if they shut off, we quit.

23:18.960 --> 23:23.800
 Now, these neurons release epinephrine.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.200
 Epinephrine is adrenaline.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.200
 And anytime we are engaged in effort of any kind,

23:28.200 --> 23:29.680
 we are releasing epinephrine.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.300
 Anytime we're awake, really,

23:31.300 --> 23:33.860
 we are releasing epinephrine into our brain.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.700
 In fact, this little group of neurons

23:38.700 --> 23:39.560
 in the back of our brain,

23:39.560 --> 23:41.920
 it's called the locus coeruleus, if you like,

23:41.920 --> 23:44.220
 is churning out epinephrine all the time.

23:44.220 --> 23:47.080
 But if something stresses us out, it churns out more,

23:47.080 --> 23:49.000
 and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal

23:49.000 --> 23:50.680
 for the whole brain.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.520
 We also, of course,

23:51.520 --> 23:53.760
 have adrenaline epinephrine released in our body,

23:53.760 --> 23:55.640
 which makes our body ready for things.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.600
 So think about epinephrine as a readiness signal.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.000
 And when we are engaged in effort,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.280
 this readiness signal is being churned into our brain.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.280
 When we're relaxed and we're falling asleep,

24:05.280 --> 24:08.760
 epinephrine levels are low, okay?

24:08.760 --> 24:11.840
 So they did a really interesting experiment

24:11.840 --> 24:16.840
 where they had subjects engage in bouts of effort

24:17.500 --> 24:20.180
 of trying to move forward toward a goal,

24:20.180 --> 24:22.520
 but they manipulated the visual environment

24:22.520 --> 24:23.480
 with these stripes,

24:23.480 --> 24:25.980
 kind of like fences passing on both sides of them.

24:27.180 --> 24:30.320
 And by doing that, they could trick subjects

24:30.320 --> 24:32.480
 into thinking that their effort

24:32.480 --> 24:35.440
 was either allowing them to move forward, right?

24:35.440 --> 24:39.160
 Because these rungs on the fence were moving past,

24:39.160 --> 24:41.840
 or that their effort was futile,

24:41.840 --> 24:43.420
 that they were no longer moving forward

24:43.420 --> 24:45.280
 because they would make the rungs move slowly

24:45.280 --> 24:47.700
 even though the subjects were making a lot of effort

24:47.700 --> 24:49.240
 to move forward, okay?

24:49.240 --> 24:52.360
 So this is analogous or similar to being on a treadmill

24:52.360 --> 24:54.360
 and you're trying to walk on this treadmill

24:54.360 --> 24:57.280
 and you just can't move the conveyor, right?

24:57.280 --> 24:58.960
 Or you're in virtual reality

24:58.960 --> 25:00.440
 and you're putting a ton of effort,

25:00.440 --> 25:02.640
 but it seems like you're moving excruciatingly slow.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.260
 I had this experience recently in real life.

25:05.260 --> 25:07.440
 I was doing a swim in the Pacific.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.640
 I was trying to go south and I was swimming

25:10.640 --> 25:12.040
 and I was caught in a current,

25:12.040 --> 25:14.160
 not the kind that pulls you out to ocean.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.320
 And I kept looking to my left

25:16.320 --> 25:19.040
 and I saw this hotel on the shoreline.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.820
 And then I was swimming and swimming

25:20.820 --> 25:21.740
 and swimming and swimming.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.480
 And 20 minutes later, I looked to my left

25:23.480 --> 25:26.160
 and the hotel is still exactly where it was before,

25:26.160 --> 25:28.400
 which meant that I wasn't moving.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.520
 It felt futile.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.300
 Eventually, either the current changed or something changed

25:34.300 --> 25:37.640
 and I eventually swam past the hotel,

25:37.640 --> 25:40.180
 got back on the beach and eventually drove home.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.160
 That's essentially what they did in this experiment.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.460
 But what they found was these neurons

25:45.460 --> 25:46.980
 that release epinephrine,

25:48.400 --> 25:51.320
 there's another cell type called glia,

25:51.320 --> 25:53.280
 which actually means glue in Latin,

25:53.280 --> 25:55.460
 that is paying attention to how much epinephrine

25:55.460 --> 25:56.300
 is being released.

25:56.300 --> 26:00.040
 And at some point, the system reaches a threshold.

26:00.040 --> 26:03.000
 It reaches this threshold and it shuts off

26:03.000 --> 26:04.360
 the release of more epinephrine.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.640
 It's like, I quit, that's it, no more effort signal.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.120
 If they could extend the time

26:12.120 --> 26:14.920
 before those glia said, ah, enough,

26:15.780 --> 26:18.300
 if they could release more adrenaline into the system,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.640
 then subjects would keep going.

26:20.640 --> 26:25.640
 So our desire to continue or put differently,

26:25.660 --> 26:29.440
 our willingness to continue and our desire to quit

26:29.440 --> 26:33.440
 is mediated by events between our two ears.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.560
 Now that doesn't mean that the body's not involved,

26:35.560 --> 26:37.680
 but it means that neurons are critically important.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.900
 So we have two categories of neurons that are important.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.520
 The ones in our head that tell us get up and go out

26:42.520 --> 26:46.440
 and take that run and the ones that allow us,

26:46.440 --> 26:48.360
 encourage us to continue that run

26:48.360 --> 26:51.360
 and we have neurons that shut things off and say no more.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.920
 And we of course have the neurons

26:52.920 --> 26:55.620
 that connect to our muscles and control our muscles.

26:55.620 --> 26:59.600
 But the reason we quit is rarely because our body quits,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.500
 our mind quits.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.760
 Now, I would never want to encourage people

27:02.760 --> 27:05.920
 to drive themselves to the point of injury.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.440
 That's not going to be good for anybody,

27:09.440 --> 27:13.120
 but it is good to know that it's neural.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.040
 Our ability to persist is neural.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.240
 So when people say, is it, I hear that sports

27:18.240 --> 27:23.240
 or effort or fighting, or it's 90% mental, 10% physical,

27:23.240 --> 27:27.200
 that whole discussion about how much is mental,

27:27.200 --> 27:29.280
 how much is physical is absolutely silly.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.640
 It just proves that there's no knowledge

27:31.640 --> 27:34.360
 of the underlying biology behind that statement.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.640
 It's neither mental nor physical.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.680
 Everything is physical.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.000
 Everything is neurons.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.280
 Your thinking is the responsibility of chemicals

27:43.280 --> 27:44.800
 and electrical signals in your head.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.880
 So it's not 90% mental, 10% physical.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.080
 It's not 50, 50.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.040
 It's not 70, 30.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.880
 It's 100% nervous system.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.000
 It's neurons, okay?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.200
 So when people say mental or physical,

27:58.200 --> 28:01.080
 understand it's 100% neural.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.120
 And I'd love for the, how much of it is mental

28:04.120 --> 28:06.900
 and how much is physical to just disappear.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.040
 That argument means nothing and it's not actionable.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.800
 Now, what do nerves need in order to continue to fire?

28:13.800 --> 28:16.200
 What do you need in order to get neurons to say,

28:16.200 --> 28:17.840
 I will persist?

28:17.840 --> 28:19.720
 Well, they need glucose.

28:19.720 --> 28:24.080
 Unless you're a keto and ketogenic adapted,

28:24.080 --> 28:26.360
 you need carbohydrate is glucose.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.840
 That's what neurons run on.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.680
 And you need electrolytes.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.760
 Neurons have what's called a sodium potassium pump,

28:34.760 --> 28:35.600
 blah, blah, blah.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.800
 They generate electricity.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.800
 We could go into all this.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.060
 I will probably do an entire lecture

28:39.060 --> 28:40.040
 about the action potential,

28:40.040 --> 28:43.880
 but basically in order to get nerve cells to fire,

28:43.880 --> 28:46.860
 to contract muscle, to say, I'm going to continue,

28:46.860 --> 28:49.940
 you need sufficient sodium salt

28:49.940 --> 28:52.080
 because the action potential,

28:52.080 --> 28:55.160
 the actual firing of neurons is driven

28:55.160 --> 28:58.920
 by sodium entering the cell, rushing into the cell.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.900
 And then there's a removal of potassium.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.320
 And then there's a kind of resetting of those levels

29:04.320 --> 29:06.040
 by something called the sodium potassium pump

29:06.040 --> 29:07.520
 and the sodium potassium pump

29:07.520 --> 29:09.840
 and sodium and action potentials.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.560
 Even if you don't know anything about that is ATP dependent.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.400
 It requires energy.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.540
 So you need energy in order to get neurons to fire.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.240
 And it is pH dependent.

29:21.240 --> 29:24.340
 It depends on the conditions or the environment

29:24.340 --> 29:27.560
 within the brain being of a certain pH or acidity.

29:27.560 --> 29:32.000
 pH is about how acid or how basic the environment is.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.220
 And we will talk a little bit about pH in simple terms

29:34.220 --> 29:35.060
 that you can understand.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.760
 So nerves need salt, they need potassium,

29:37.760 --> 29:39.680
 and it turns out they need magnesium

29:39.680 --> 29:42.080
 and you need glucose and carbohydrates

29:42.080 --> 29:43.360
 in order to power those neurons

29:43.360 --> 29:46.360
 unless you are running on ketones.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.820
 And to run on ketones,

29:47.820 --> 29:50.920
 you have to make sure that you're fully keto adapted.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.160
 I will talk about adding in ketones

29:53.160 --> 29:56.300
 on top of carbohydrate at the end of the episode.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.940
 Okay, so that's how nerves work.

29:57.940 --> 30:00.320
 You need carbohydrate, you need sodium, potassium,

30:00.320 --> 30:03.220
 and magnesium in order to drive the brain.

30:04.180 --> 30:08.800
 Muscle, muscle is going to engage and generate energy first

30:08.800 --> 30:11.480
 by using this phosphocreatine system.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.040
 High bouts of effort, really intense effort,

30:14.040 --> 30:16.480
 short-lived seconds to minutes,

30:16.480 --> 30:17.680
 but probably more like seconds

30:17.680 --> 30:18.960
 is going to be this phosphocreatine,

30:18.960 --> 30:20.560
 literally a fuel source in the muscle

30:20.560 --> 30:21.700
 that you're going to burn,

30:21.700 --> 30:24.780
 just like you would logs on a fire.

30:24.780 --> 30:28.280
 And glycogen, which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle,

30:28.280 --> 30:29.600
 that also can be burned,

30:29.600 --> 30:31.660
 just like logs on a fire to generate energy.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.240
 So let me make this crystal clear.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.160
 If you move your wrist towards your shoulder

30:35.160 --> 30:37.280
 and contract your bicep really hard,

30:37.280 --> 30:39.960
 muscle fibers are burning up their own carbohydrate.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.760
 They're converting that into ATP

30:41.760 --> 30:45.000
 in order to generate that energy, okay?

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
 And pH is important and temperature is important.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.800
 In the episode on supercharge, your physical performance,

30:53.800 --> 30:56.980
 I talked all about how by using cooling,

30:56.980 --> 30:59.680
 specifically of the palms or the bottoms of the feet

30:59.680 --> 31:02.660
 or the cheeks of the face using particular methods,

31:02.660 --> 31:07.660
 you can adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle

31:07.660 --> 31:10.080
 in a way that allows you to do more work,

31:10.080 --> 31:12.420
 to do more reps, to run further,

31:12.420 --> 31:14.740
 to keep going and to persist.

31:14.740 --> 31:19.740
 And that's because if temperature is too low or too high,

31:20.100 --> 31:23.960
 then ATP is not going to be available

31:23.960 --> 31:24.800
 because of this whole thing

31:24.800 --> 31:26.660
 called the pyruvate kinase pathway

31:26.660 --> 31:28.660
 and the temperature dependence of pyruvate kinase.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.480
 Check out that episode if you want to learn more about that,

31:30.480 --> 31:33.560
 but temperature is important and pH is also important.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.700
 So we've got nerve, muscle,

31:34.700 --> 31:36.520
 and then there's stuff in our blood

31:36.520 --> 31:38.820
 that's available as an energy source.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.360
 And in blood, we've got glucose,

31:40.360 --> 31:42.220
 so literally blood sugar that's floating around.

31:42.220 --> 31:44.420
 So let's say you have fasted for three days,

31:44.420 --> 31:46.440
 your blood glucose is going to be very low,

31:46.440 --> 31:48.780
 so that's not going to be a great fuel source,

31:48.780 --> 31:52.220
 but you will start to liberate fats from your adipose tissue

31:52.220 --> 31:55.100
 from your fat, fatty acids will start to mobilize

31:55.100 --> 31:58.860
 into the bloodstream and you can burn those for energy

31:58.860 --> 32:00.420
 and oxygen in your blood.

32:00.420 --> 32:03.140
 When you inhale, you're bringing oxygen into your blood.

32:03.140 --> 32:05.340
 So these are all fuel sources in your neurons,

32:05.340 --> 32:07.300
 in your muscle, in your blood,

32:07.300 --> 32:12.300
 in your various tissues that are providing the opportunity

32:12.620 --> 32:16.180
 to give effort, to induce effort,

32:16.180 --> 32:19.260
 whether or not it's a run or a swim or writing or talking.

32:19.260 --> 32:22.860
 Now, there are some other factors that are important

32:22.860 --> 32:26.100
 and those are the heart, which is going to move blood.

32:26.100 --> 32:29.980
 So the more that the heart can move blood and oxygen,

32:29.980 --> 32:33.740
 well, the more fuel that's going to be available

32:33.740 --> 32:38.180
 for you to engage in muscular effort and thinking effort.

32:38.180 --> 32:39.940
 So your heart is vitally important

32:39.940 --> 32:41.940
 to your muscle's ability to work

32:41.940 --> 32:43.600
 and your brain's ability to work.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.660
 And as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.020
 it should be obvious then that the lungs are very important.

32:49.020 --> 32:50.660
 You need to bring oxygen in

32:50.660 --> 32:52.660
 and distribute it to all these tissues

32:52.660 --> 32:54.700
 because oxygen is critical

32:54.700 --> 32:56.740
 for the conversion of carbohydrates

32:57.940 --> 33:00.060
 and the conversion of fats.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.380
 And we could get into the discussion

33:02.380 --> 33:03.700
 about whether or not oxygen is important

33:03.700 --> 33:06.920
 for ketogenic metabolism, but you need oxygen there.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.640
 You need to breathe and you need to breathe properly.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.580
 So I just covered what would normally be

33:12.580 --> 33:15.800
 about four lectures of energy consumption

33:15.800 --> 33:16.940
 and energy utilization.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.320
 I didn't go into much detail at all,

33:18.320 --> 33:20.980
 but what I want you to imagine

33:20.980 --> 33:23.380
 is that you've got these different cell types.

33:23.380 --> 33:25.580
 You've got neurons, you've got muscle.

33:25.580 --> 33:28.460
 They need to collaborate in order to generate effort

33:28.460 --> 33:30.180
 or to make the decision to do something

33:30.180 --> 33:33.060
 or to think hard or to run hard or to run far.

33:33.060 --> 33:34.940
 And then you've got fuel sources,

33:34.940 --> 33:39.940
 both in the neurons, in the muscle, in your blood,

33:40.260 --> 33:42.940
 and then the heart and lungs are going to help

33:42.940 --> 33:45.720
 distribute the oxygen and those fuels.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.540
 And of course you have that little energy pack

33:48.540 --> 33:51.220
 that we call the liver that will allow you

33:51.220 --> 33:53.180
 to pull out a little more carbohydrate

33:53.180 --> 33:55.900
 if you need it for work, okay?

33:55.900 --> 33:57.920
 So that's as much as I want to cover

33:57.920 --> 33:59.160
 about energy consumption

33:59.160 --> 34:00.860
 because that's a lot.

34:00.860 --> 34:03.020
 But what it tells you is that when you eat

34:03.020 --> 34:05.020
 and you use food as a fuel source,

34:05.020 --> 34:07.860
 that food can be broken down

34:07.860 --> 34:10.040
 and you can immediately burn the glucose

34:10.040 --> 34:10.900
 that's in your bloodstream,

34:10.900 --> 34:13.740
 or you can rely on some of the stored fuel in your liver,

34:13.740 --> 34:15.960
 or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle,

34:15.960 --> 34:17.380
 so-called glycogen.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.060
 And there are a lot of different ways

34:19.060 --> 34:20.940
 that we can generate ATP.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.180
 So when we ask the question,

34:22.180 --> 34:25.320
 what's limiting for performance?

34:25.320 --> 34:28.300
 What is going to allow us to endure,

34:28.300 --> 34:31.900
 to engage in effort and endure long bouts of effort

34:31.900 --> 34:34.540
 or even moderately long bouts of effort?

34:34.540 --> 34:36.560
 We need to ask which of those things,

34:36.560 --> 34:40.620
 nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs is limiting?

34:40.620 --> 34:41.820
 Or put differently,

34:41.820 --> 34:44.040
 we ask what should we be doing with our neurons?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.380
 What should we be doing with our muscles?

34:45.380 --> 34:47.040
 What should we be doing with our blood?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.180
 What should we be doing with our heart?

34:48.180 --> 34:50.320
 And what should we be doing with our lungs

34:50.320 --> 34:53.940
 that's going to allow us to build endurance

34:53.940 --> 34:55.980
 for mental and physical work

34:55.980 --> 35:00.980
 and to be able to go longer, further with more intensity?

35:02.940 --> 35:03.960
 That's the real question.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.100
 How can we do more work?

35:06.100 --> 35:07.980
 And the way we do that is with energy.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.500
 And the way to get energy to it is to buy those five things.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.240
 And so now we're going to talk about

35:12.240 --> 35:16.440
 how you can actually build different types of endurance

35:16.440 --> 35:19.760
 and what that does at the level of your blood,

35:19.760 --> 35:21.500
 your heart, your muscles, and your neurons.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.420
 So we're going to skip back and forth

35:23.420 --> 35:26.900
 between protocols, tools, and the underlying science.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.540
 So rather than heavy stack the science at the front end

35:29.540 --> 35:31.240
 and then just give you all the tools at the end,

35:31.240 --> 35:34.780
 we're going to talk about the protocols,

35:34.780 --> 35:37.220
 the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve them.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.540
 And we are going to talk about the underlying science

35:39.540 --> 35:41.540
 as we move through that.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.180
 If you would like a lot of detailed science,

35:44.180 --> 35:46.180
 I encourage you to check out a review

35:46.180 --> 35:48.780
 that we've linked in the show notes.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.220
 And the review is called

35:50.220 --> 35:53.120
 Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.500
 This is a review article with many excellent citations.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.280
 It's from Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.320
 The Cold Spring Harbor Press

36:00.320 --> 36:02.340
 is an excellent scientific press.

36:02.340 --> 36:04.860
 It's been the last 21 years doing summers

36:04.860 --> 36:07.220
 at Cold Spring Harbor teaching neuroscience,

36:07.220 --> 36:08.740
 but Cold Spring Harbor is involved

36:08.740 --> 36:11.340
 in all sorts of themes and topics

36:11.340 --> 36:14.260
 related to neuroscience and medicine.

36:14.260 --> 36:18.580
 This review by Hughes Elifesen,

36:18.580 --> 36:20.860
 Elifesen, that's the name, Elifesen and Barr,

36:20.860 --> 36:24.220
 B-A-A-R, Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training,

36:24.220 --> 36:26.060
 is rich with citations.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.380
 It can be downloaded as a complete PDF.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.860
 There's no paywall and we will link to it.

36:30.860 --> 36:34.980
 And it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades,

36:34.980 --> 36:37.660
 the genetic changes within muscle

36:37.660 --> 36:39.220
 with high-intensity interval training,

36:39.220 --> 36:43.820
 short-term super high-intensity training, weight training.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.380
 So if you're a real nerd for this stuff

36:46.380 --> 36:48.980
 and you want to get right down into how PGC1 alpha,

36:48.980 --> 36:53.420
 P53 and pH 20 change the adaptation features

36:53.420 --> 36:54.940
 of muscle and gene regulation,

36:54.940 --> 36:56.700
 that is definitely the review for you.

36:56.700 --> 36:58.060
 If you're like most people

36:58.060 --> 37:00.780
 and you're not really interested in that level of detail,

37:00.780 --> 37:02.140
 no reason to pick up the review

37:02.140 --> 37:03.260
 unless you just want to check out

37:03.260 --> 37:05.500
 some of the figures and pictures.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.780
 But I do want to offer that as a resource.

37:07.780 --> 37:11.380
 It's been, in addition to discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,

37:11.380 --> 37:12.960
 it's been a primary resource

37:12.960 --> 37:15.660
 for the content of this episode.

37:15.660 --> 37:18.380
 So let's talk about the four kinds of endurance

37:18.380 --> 37:20.620
 and how to achieve those.

37:20.620 --> 37:23.020
 I do believe that everybody should have

37:23.020 --> 37:25.420
 some sort of endurance practice,

37:25.420 --> 37:27.380
 regular endurance practice.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.900
 It's clear that it's vital

37:28.900 --> 37:31.460
 for the functioning of the body and the mind,

37:31.460 --> 37:35.540
 and there are clear longevity benefits.

37:35.540 --> 37:38.100
 There are a lot of reasons why that's true,

37:38.100 --> 37:40.900
 but the main one is that

37:40.900 --> 37:44.620
 if we have good energy utilization

37:44.620 --> 37:48.300
 in our musculature and in our blood,

37:48.300 --> 37:49.980
 in our vascular system,

37:49.980 --> 37:53.420
 and in our oxygenating system, our lungs,

37:53.420 --> 37:55.180
 the so-called cardiovascular system,

37:55.180 --> 37:57.660
 respiratory system, and musculature,

37:57.660 --> 38:00.020
 the body and brain function much better.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.900
 There are so many papers now,

38:01.900 --> 38:04.140
 so much data to support that.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.140
 So I do believe everyone

38:06.140 --> 38:09.540
 should either try to maintain the muscle that they have,

38:09.540 --> 38:11.220
 provided they've already gone through puberty

38:11.220 --> 38:12.640
 and development,

38:12.640 --> 38:16.740
 and they should be engaged in regular endurance exercise.

38:16.740 --> 38:19.620
 Now, for many people, they think endurance exercise,

38:19.620 --> 38:21.020
 that means what?

38:21.020 --> 38:24.340
 A hour long run, or I got to get on the Stairmaster,

38:24.340 --> 38:27.340
 or I have to treadmill for hours on end each week.

38:27.340 --> 38:28.660
 It turns out that's not the case.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.300
 There are four kinds of endurance,

38:30.300 --> 38:33.540
 and you can train specifically for any one of those,

38:33.540 --> 38:35.060
 and you can vary your training.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.360
 So let's talk about those four kinds of endurance,

38:37.360 --> 38:38.480
 because they're very interesting,

38:38.480 --> 38:41.740
 and they each have very different protocols

38:41.740 --> 38:45.440
 that you use in order to build and maximize them,

38:45.440 --> 38:49.400
 and now you'll understand what fuel sources they use

38:49.400 --> 38:51.660
 in order to build that thing we call endurance.

38:51.660 --> 38:55.460
 So first of all, we have muscular endurance.

38:55.460 --> 39:00.460
 Muscular endurance is the ability for our muscles

39:00.900 --> 39:04.220
 to perform work over time,

39:04.220 --> 39:09.040
 and our failure to continue to be able to perform that work

39:09.040 --> 39:12.360
 is going to be due to muscular fatigue,

39:12.360 --> 39:15.100
 not to cardiovascular fatigue.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.820
 So not because we're breathing too hard,

39:16.820 --> 39:19.120
 or we can't get enough blood to the muscles,

39:19.120 --> 39:21.180
 or because we quit mentally,

39:21.180 --> 39:25.540
 but because the muscles themselves give out, okay?

39:25.540 --> 39:28.180
 One good example of this would be

39:28.180 --> 39:32.660
 if you had to pick up a stone in the yard,

39:32.660 --> 39:36.380
 and that stone is not extremely heavy for you,

39:36.380 --> 39:40.860
 and you needed to do that anywhere from 50 to 100 times,

39:40.860 --> 39:42.520
 and you were picking it up and putting it down,

39:42.520 --> 39:43.740
 and picking it up and putting it down,

39:43.740 --> 39:45.420
 and picking up and putting it down,

39:45.420 --> 39:48.540
 at some point, your muscles will fatigue.

39:48.540 --> 39:50.740
 They will fail to endure.

39:50.740 --> 39:53.820
 Muscular endurance is incredibly useful

39:53.820 --> 39:57.180
 for a variety of physical pursuits,

39:57.180 --> 39:58.820
 and we will talk about the mental pursuits

39:58.820 --> 40:00.520
 that it supports as well.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.740
 In terms of physical pursuits,

40:02.740 --> 40:06.880
 the ability for a given muscle to perform repeated work

40:06.880 --> 40:09.340
 is going to improve your golf swing.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.680
 It's going to improve your tennis swing.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.520
 It's going to improve your posture,

40:13.520 --> 40:14.800
 your ability to dance,

40:14.800 --> 40:18.700
 your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity

40:18.700 --> 40:23.300
 that requires effort in a way that's very different

40:23.300 --> 40:25.400
 from the kind of endurance that you will build

40:25.400 --> 40:28.220
 simply by increasing your cardiovascular fitness,

40:28.220 --> 40:31.240
 your ability to generate kind of easy repetition.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.940
 So let's talk about muscular endurance and what it is.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.740
 Muscular endurance is going to be something

40:36.740 --> 40:41.740
 that you can perform for anywhere from 12 to 25,

40:41.740 --> 40:44.720
 or even up to 100 repetitions.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.700
 And that's actually how, if you like,

40:46.700 --> 40:48.720
 you would train muscular endurance.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.900
 And I will give the specific protocol in a few moments.

40:51.900 --> 40:54.900
 So a good example is pushups, right?

40:54.900 --> 40:59.620
 If you were to get on the floor and start doing pushups,

40:59.620 --> 41:02.800
 even if you're somebody who has to do knees down pushups,

41:02.800 --> 41:04.120
 and you're doing your pushups,

41:04.120 --> 41:06.540
 eventually you won't be able to do any more pushups.

41:06.540 --> 41:07.660
 And that's not going to be

41:07.660 --> 41:12.100
 because you couldn't get enough oxygen into your system

41:12.100 --> 41:14.940
 or your heart wasn't pumping enough blood.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.380
 It's going to be because the muscles fail.

41:17.380 --> 41:18.400
 That's why.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.500
 So if you want to be able to do more pushups

41:20.500 --> 41:22.140
 or even more pullups,

41:22.140 --> 41:25.100
 muscular endurance is really what it's about.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.380
 It's actually no coincidence

41:26.380 --> 41:29.640
 that a lot of military bootcamp style training

41:29.640 --> 41:30.720
 is not done with weights.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.620
 It's done with things like pushups, pullups,

41:32.620 --> 41:34.000
 sit-ups, and running,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.200
 because what they're really building is muscular endurance,

41:36.200 --> 41:39.520
 the ability to perform work repeatedly over time

41:39.520 --> 41:42.340
 for a given set of muscles and neurons.

41:42.340 --> 41:44.540
 So what's a good protocol to build muscular endurance?

41:44.540 --> 41:45.540
 Let's just give that to you now

41:45.540 --> 41:50.540
 and explain some of the underlying science as it follows.

41:50.600 --> 41:54.700
 So a really good muscular endurance training protocol,

41:54.700 --> 41:56.280
 according to the scientific literature,

41:56.280 --> 41:58.620
 would be three to five sets

41:58.620 --> 42:02.460
 of anywhere from 12 to 100 repetitions.

42:02.460 --> 42:04.120
 That's a huge range.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.500
 Now, 12 to 25 repetitions

42:06.500 --> 42:11.500
 is going to be more reasonable for most people.

42:11.580 --> 42:13.860
 And the rest periods are going to be

42:13.860 --> 42:17.440
 anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds of rest.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.860
 So anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest.

42:19.860 --> 42:22.940
 So this might be five sets of pushups

42:22.940 --> 42:25.060
 done getting your maximum pushups.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.500
 For some people, that might be zero

42:26.500 --> 42:27.840
 and you have to do it knees down.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.340
 For some people, it might be 10 pushups.

42:29.340 --> 42:30.500
 For some people, it might be 25,

42:30.500 --> 42:32.160
 but you could go all the way up to 100.

42:32.160 --> 42:35.020
 Rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds

42:35.020 --> 42:38.380
 and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets.

42:38.380 --> 42:40.700
 So it doesn't actually sound like a ton of work.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.040
 The other thing you could do is something like a plank.

42:43.040 --> 42:46.500
 A plank position is actually a way

42:46.500 --> 42:51.500
 to build muscular endurance, not strength, okay?

42:51.540 --> 42:53.660
 I'm sure it could be used to develop strength,

42:53.660 --> 42:55.380
 but it's really about muscular endurance.

42:55.380 --> 42:57.940
 So you would do three to five sets of planks.

42:57.940 --> 42:59.420
 Those planks would probably,

42:59.420 --> 43:00.820
 even because you're not doing repetitions,

43:00.820 --> 43:02.540
 it's an isometric hold, as we say,

43:02.540 --> 43:04.980
 it's kind of static hold or a wall sit

43:04.980 --> 43:06.220
 would be another example.

43:06.220 --> 43:10.060
 And you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes,

43:10.060 --> 43:13.780
 take some rest of anywhere from 30 to 60 or 180 seconds

43:13.780 --> 43:14.980
 and then repeat.

43:14.980 --> 43:17.720
 So things like pushing a sled, pushups,

43:17.720 --> 43:22.720
 isometric planks, even pull-ups, those will all work.

43:23.420 --> 43:26.940
 And as with other forms of training,

43:26.940 --> 43:29.980
 you would want to do this until you approach failure

43:29.980 --> 43:32.780
 or actually fail and where you're unable

43:32.780 --> 43:34.060
 to perform another repetition,

43:34.060 --> 43:36.700
 that would mark the end of a set.

43:36.700 --> 43:40.020
 The one critical feature of building muscular endurance

43:40.020 --> 43:44.900
 is that it has no major eccentric loading component.

43:44.900 --> 43:47.960
 Now, I haven't talked much about eccentric

43:47.960 --> 43:51.240
 and concentric loading, but concentric loading

43:51.240 --> 43:54.540
 is when you are shortening the muscle typically

43:54.540 --> 43:57.300
 or lifting a weight and eccentric movements

43:57.300 --> 43:59.860
 are when you are lengthening a muscle typically

43:59.860 --> 44:01.640
 or lowering a weight.

44:01.640 --> 44:04.780
 So if you do a pull-up and you get your chin over the bar

44:04.780 --> 44:08.180
 or a chin-up, that's the concentric portion of the effort.

44:08.180 --> 44:11.460
 And then as you lower yourself, that's the eccentric portion.

44:11.460 --> 44:15.220
 Eccentric portion of resistance training of any kind,

44:15.220 --> 44:17.260
 whether or not it's for endurance or for strength

44:17.260 --> 44:20.160
 is one of the major causes of soreness.

44:20.160 --> 44:23.660
 Some people will be more susceptible to this,

44:23.660 --> 44:25.120
 excuse me, than others,

44:25.120 --> 44:28.900
 but it does create more damage in muscle fibers.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.780
 Muscular endurance and building muscular endurance

44:31.780 --> 44:33.580
 should not include any movements

44:33.580 --> 44:36.340
 that include major eccentric loads.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.900
 So if you're going to do push-ups,

44:38.900 --> 44:40.540
 doesn't mean that you want to drop,

44:40.540 --> 44:42.900
 smash your chest into the floor.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.580
 And by the way, your chest should touch the ground

44:44.580 --> 44:47.860
 on every push-up, that's a real push-up, okay?

44:47.860 --> 44:49.660
 It's not about breaking 90 with the elbows,

44:49.660 --> 44:52.180
 it's about pushing down till your chest touch the floor

44:52.180 --> 44:54.220
 and straightening out, that's a proper push-up.

44:54.220 --> 44:57.680
 And a pull-up is where you pull your chin above the bar.

44:57.680 --> 44:58.980
 Neither of those should include

44:58.980 --> 45:02.140
 a slow eccentric or lowering component

45:02.140 --> 45:05.020
 if you are using those to train muscular endurance,

45:05.020 --> 45:07.660
 the three to five sets of 12 to 25

45:07.660 --> 45:09.740
 and maybe even up to 100 repetitions

45:09.740 --> 45:14.060
 with 30 to 180 seconds of rest in between.

45:14.060 --> 45:18.740
 That means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool

45:18.740 --> 45:21.480
 for building muscular endurance

45:21.480 --> 45:25.420
 because jumping has a slowing down component as you land.

45:25.420 --> 45:28.300
 So things like plyometrics or agility work

45:28.300 --> 45:29.680
 where you're moving from side to side

45:29.680 --> 45:32.500
 and you're decelerating, you're slowing yourself down a lot,

45:32.500 --> 45:34.620
 not going to be good for muscular endurance.

45:34.620 --> 45:37.020
 Terrific for cardiovascular training

45:37.020 --> 45:38.300
 and conditioning of other kinds

45:38.300 --> 45:40.640
 and skill training and agility and all that.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.620
 But if you want to build muscular endurance,

45:43.620 --> 45:45.180
 you want to make your muscles able

45:45.180 --> 45:47.900
 to do more work for longer,

45:47.900 --> 45:49.820
 it's going to be this three to five sets

45:49.820 --> 45:53.500
 of 12 to 100 reps, 30 to 180 seconds

45:53.500 --> 45:56.620
 of mainly concentric movement, okay?

45:56.620 --> 46:01.620
 Not a slow lowering phase or a heavy lowering phase.

46:01.960 --> 46:05.300
 So that might be kettlebell swings and things of that sort.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.620
 Isometrics, as I mentioned,

46:06.620 --> 46:08.920
 things like plank and wall sits will work.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.980
 Now what's interesting about this

46:10.980 --> 46:12.780
 is that it doesn't seem at all

46:12.780 --> 46:15.560
 like what people normally think of as endurance.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.900
 And yet it's been shown

46:17.900 --> 46:20.020
 in nice quality peer-reviewed studies,

46:20.020 --> 46:23.180
 several of which are cited in the review I mentioned earlier

46:23.180 --> 46:27.620
 that muscular endurance can improve our ability

46:27.620 --> 46:31.580
 to engage in long bouts of what we call long duration,

46:31.580 --> 46:33.560
 low intensity endurance work.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.580
 So this can support long runs,

46:35.580 --> 46:40.060
 it can support long swims and it can build also,

46:40.060 --> 46:45.060
 it can build postural strength and endurance simultaneously.

46:45.580 --> 46:48.140
 And that's mainly accomplished through isometric holds.

46:48.140 --> 46:51.740
 So things like planks are actually quite good

46:51.740 --> 46:54.360
 for building endurance of the spinal erector muscles

46:54.360 --> 46:57.540
 that provide posture of the abdominal muscles

46:57.540 --> 47:00.220
 that are helpful for posture, for being upright,

47:00.220 --> 47:03.440
 for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.460
 These days, everyone seems to have text neck.

47:05.460 --> 47:07.740
 Everyone's basically staring at their toes all the time.

47:07.740 --> 47:09.580
 It has a default towards their toes.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.560
 So isometric holds can be very good

47:11.560 --> 47:13.740
 for building muscular endurance.

47:13.740 --> 47:17.620
 You can spot people, including yourself, perhaps,

47:17.620 --> 47:20.920
 with poor muscular endurance in the postural muscles

47:20.920 --> 47:22.660
 because anytime they stop moving,

47:22.660 --> 47:24.340
 they have to lean against a wall

47:24.340 --> 47:26.580
 or their hip will move to one side

47:26.580 --> 47:28.300
 or they're always leaned to one side.

47:28.300 --> 47:29.860
 I am guilty of this too.

47:29.860 --> 47:31.560
 Some of you have actually pointed out,

47:31.560 --> 47:33.380
 I like to think out of concern,

47:33.380 --> 47:36.260
 that I often am rubbing my lower back

47:36.260 --> 47:38.980
 and indeed I have some asymmetries in my postural muscles,

47:38.980 --> 47:40.420
 some of which are probably genetic

47:40.420 --> 47:43.280
 and some of which are probably just from excessive work

47:43.280 --> 47:44.500
 or something of that sort

47:44.500 --> 47:46.960
 that have my right shoulder sit lower than my left

47:46.960 --> 47:47.960
 and things of that sort.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.660
 If I wanted to improve those,

47:49.660 --> 47:52.140
 I could improve those by really focusing on symmetry

47:52.140 --> 47:53.620
 and isometric symmetry,

47:53.620 --> 47:56.860
 meaning holding my hands at equivalent positions in planks

47:56.860 --> 47:59.260
 and doing isometric holds

47:59.260 --> 48:03.060
 for building muscular endurance of the postural muscles.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.260
 But this can also be done with, as I mentioned,

48:05.260 --> 48:07.340
 kettlebell swings for the lower back and legs

48:07.340 --> 48:08.520
 and posterior chain.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.840
 So there are a number of different exercises

48:09.840 --> 48:10.680
 you could do this with,

48:10.680 --> 48:14.200
 but it should be compound exercises mainly.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.980
 It's rare for people to do

48:15.980 --> 48:17.900
 this kind of muscular endurance work

48:17.900 --> 48:21.620
 specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.140
 And there aren't many activities

48:23.140 --> 48:26.940
 that really rely on isolation of those muscles repeatedly.

48:26.940 --> 48:28.020
 I'm sure there are some out there,

48:28.020 --> 48:30.180
 but it's kind of hard to imagine.

48:30.180 --> 48:32.560
 So you can do this with isometrics,

48:32.560 --> 48:34.860
 you can do this with more standard

48:34.860 --> 48:36.140
 non-isometric type movements,

48:36.140 --> 48:38.700
 but make sure there isn't a strong eccentric load.

48:38.700 --> 48:40.500
 So now let's talk about the science briefly

48:40.500 --> 48:42.460
 of why this works.

48:42.460 --> 48:46.940
 Well, that takes us back to this issue of fuel utilization

48:46.940 --> 48:48.620
 and what fails.

48:48.620 --> 48:52.660
 So if we were to say, okay, let's say you do a plank

48:52.660 --> 48:54.820
 and you're planking for, you know,

48:54.820 --> 48:56.340
 maybe you're able to plank for a minute

48:56.340 --> 48:58.320
 or two minutes or three minutes,

48:58.320 --> 48:59.980
 at some point you will fail.

48:59.980 --> 49:02.300
 You're not going to fail because the heart gives out.

49:02.300 --> 49:05.640
 You're not going to fail because you can't get enough oxygen

49:05.640 --> 49:07.540
 because you can breathe while you're doing that.

49:07.540 --> 49:10.140
 You're going to fail because of local muscular failure,

49:10.140 --> 49:11.780
 which means that as you do,

49:11.780 --> 49:13.860
 if you choose to do this protocol

49:13.860 --> 49:16.300
 of three to five sets, et cetera, et cetera,

49:16.300 --> 49:18.700
 to build muscular endurance,

49:18.700 --> 49:21.700
 mainly what you are going to be building

49:21.700 --> 49:23.620
 is you're going to be building

49:23.620 --> 49:27.420
 the ability of your mitochondria to use oxygen

49:27.420 --> 49:29.240
 to generate energy locally.

49:29.240 --> 49:32.540
 And that it's something called mitochondrial respiration,

49:32.540 --> 49:36.220
 respiration because of the involvement of oxygen.

49:36.220 --> 49:41.140
 And it's also going to be increasing the extent

49:41.140 --> 49:44.660
 to which the neurons control the muscles

49:44.660 --> 49:48.340
 and provide a stimulus for the muscles to contract.

49:48.340 --> 49:51.520
 But this is independent of power and strength, okay?

49:51.520 --> 49:55.340
 So even though the low sets like three to five sets

49:55.340 --> 49:57.300
 and the fact that you're doing repetitions

49:57.300 --> 49:59.060
 and you're going to failure,

49:59.060 --> 50:02.180
 even though it seems to resemble power and strength

50:02.180 --> 50:04.980
 and hypertrophy type training, it is distinctly different.

50:04.980 --> 50:08.240
 It's not going to generate strength, hypertrophy, and power.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.660
 It's going to mainly create this ability to endure,

50:11.660 --> 50:14.980
 to continually contract muscles or repeatedly contract

50:14.980 --> 50:16.220
 muscles, okay?

50:16.220 --> 50:18.380
 Continually if you're using isometric holds,

50:18.380 --> 50:20.180
 repeatedly, excuse me,

50:20.180 --> 50:23.480
 if you're using repetition type exercise

50:23.480 --> 50:27.660
 where there's a contraction and an extension of the muscle,

50:27.660 --> 50:30.800
 essentially concentric and an eccentric portion.

50:30.800 --> 50:33.100
 But remember that you want the eccentric portion

50:33.100 --> 50:36.320
 to be light and relatively fast,

50:36.320 --> 50:37.620
 not so fast that you injure yourself,

50:37.620 --> 50:40.740
 but certainly not deliberately slowed down.

50:40.740 --> 50:44.500
 It was recommended, I should say,

50:44.500 --> 50:48.820
 by Andy Galpin that you not use Olympic lifts for this

50:48.820 --> 50:53.020
 because once you get past eight or 12 or 25 repetitions,

50:53.020 --> 50:56.220
 especially form on those Olympic lifts is key

50:56.220 --> 50:57.980
 for not getting injured.

50:57.980 --> 51:01.020
 And while some people can perform those sorts of lifts

51:01.020 --> 51:03.780
 like snatches and deadlifts and cleans and jerks

51:03.780 --> 51:07.500
 and overhead presses, probably not a great idea

51:07.500 --> 51:11.180
 if the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue

51:11.180 --> 51:12.900
 because you do open yourself up to injury

51:12.900 --> 51:14.500
 unless you're very skilled at doing that

51:14.500 --> 51:15.580
 or you have a really good coach

51:15.580 --> 51:17.880
 who can help you guide through those lifts.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.780
 So that's one form of endurance,

51:19.780 --> 51:20.840
 which is muscular endurance.

51:20.840 --> 51:24.180
 It's mainly going to rely on neural energy,

51:24.180 --> 51:26.900
 so nerves and muscle.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.900
 And it's not going to rely quite so much

51:28.900 --> 51:30.620
 on what's available in your blood,

51:30.620 --> 51:32.620
 your heart or your lungs.

51:32.620 --> 51:35.640
 So now let's talk about the other extreme of endurance,

51:35.640 --> 51:38.300
 which is long duration endurance.

51:38.300 --> 51:41.180
 This is the type that people typically think about

51:41.180 --> 51:42.980
 when they think about endurance.

51:42.980 --> 51:46.600
 You're talking about a long run, a long swim,

51:46.600 --> 51:47.900
 a long bike ride.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.080
 Well, how long?

51:49.080 --> 51:53.620
 Well, anywhere from 12 minutes to several hours

51:53.620 --> 51:55.020
 or maybe even an entire day,

51:55.020 --> 51:58.500
 maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking.

51:58.500 --> 51:59.740
 Some people are actually doing those kinds

51:59.740 --> 52:02.660
 of really long events, marathons, for instance.

52:02.660 --> 52:05.380
 So anything longer than 12 minutes.

52:05.380 --> 52:10.380
 And this type of work builds on fuel utilization

52:10.560 --> 52:12.340
 in the muscles.

52:12.340 --> 52:15.700
 It builds on the activity of neurons in the brain

52:15.700 --> 52:18.720
 that are involved in what we call central pattern generators.

52:18.720 --> 52:21.100
 We talked about this in a previous episode

52:21.100 --> 52:22.540
 or several previous episodes.

52:22.540 --> 52:24.740
 These are groups of neurons that allow our body

52:24.740 --> 52:27.300
 to engage in regular rhythmic effort

52:27.300 --> 52:29.700
 without having to think about the movement too much.

52:29.700 --> 52:31.740
 So running and stepping or swimming,

52:31.740 --> 52:34.420
 if you already know how to swim or pedaling on a bike

52:34.420 --> 52:36.000
 or walking upstairs and hiking,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.740
 you're not thinking about right, left, right, left.

52:38.740 --> 52:42.100
 It's all carried out by central pattern generators.

52:42.100 --> 52:45.440
 This is going to be at less than 100%

52:45.440 --> 52:48.740
 of your maximum oxygen uptake, your VO2 max.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.500
 I'll talk about what VO2 max is,

52:50.500 --> 52:52.700
 but I just want to give a sense of what the protocol is

52:52.700 --> 52:54.740
 and the underlying science.

52:54.740 --> 52:56.600
 How many sets?

52:56.600 --> 52:57.500
 One.

52:57.500 --> 53:02.500
 Long duration effort is one set of 12 minutes or longer.

53:02.820 --> 53:04.140
 So you're not counting repetitions.

53:04.140 --> 53:06.300
 I sure hope that if you're going out on a 30 minute run

53:06.300 --> 53:10.140
 or even a 15 minute run, that you're not counting steps,

53:10.140 --> 53:11.760
 that you're not counting pedal strokes,

53:11.760 --> 53:15.660
 that you're not on the rower counting pulls on the rower.

53:15.660 --> 53:16.640
 I suppose you could,

53:16.640 --> 53:18.780
 but I think that would be pretty dreadful.

53:18.780 --> 53:22.460
 It seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.900
 You're getting into regular repeated effort

53:25.900 --> 53:29.680
 and your ability to continue that effort

53:29.680 --> 53:31.780
 is going to be dependent mainly

53:31.780 --> 53:34.060
 on the efficiency of the movement,

53:34.060 --> 53:36.460
 on your ability to strike a balance

53:36.460 --> 53:40.020
 between the movement itself,

53:40.020 --> 53:43.740
 the generation of the muscular movements that are required

53:43.740 --> 53:47.900
 and fuel utilization across the different sources

53:47.900 --> 53:50.220
 of nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.

53:50.220 --> 53:53.140
 So let's ask the question, why would you fail on a long run?

53:53.140 --> 53:54.500
 Why would you quit?

53:54.500 --> 53:57.100
 Well, as you set out on that long run,

53:57.100 --> 53:58.860
 assuming you have some glycogen in your liver

53:58.860 --> 54:01.360
 and in your muscles, you're going to use that energy first,

54:01.360 --> 54:03.220
 even if it's very low intensity.

54:03.220 --> 54:04.420
 In case we're not talking about sprinting,

54:04.420 --> 54:06.780
 we're talking about heading out the door

54:06.780 --> 54:09.260
 or starting off on a marathon.

54:09.260 --> 54:11.340
 You're starting to, assuming you have some conditioning

54:11.340 --> 54:13.620
 or even if you don't, you're going to burn carbohydrate.

54:13.620 --> 54:15.300
 You're going to burn glucose in the bloodstream.

54:15.300 --> 54:16.520
 You're going to burn carbohydrate

54:16.520 --> 54:17.660
 as those muscles contract,

54:17.660 --> 54:19.060
 those what we call slow twitch muscles.

54:19.060 --> 54:21.360
 They're contracting, they start burning up fuel

54:21.360 --> 54:23.920
 to make ATP to continue to contract.

54:25.040 --> 54:29.380
 Your mind is going to use more or less energy

54:29.380 --> 54:32.000
 depending on how much willpower,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.600
 how much of a fight you have to get into with yourself

54:34.600 --> 54:36.120
 in order to generate the effort.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.700
 I really want to underscore this.

54:37.700 --> 54:38.820
 If you're somebody that's thinking,

54:38.820 --> 54:40.580
 maybe I go for the run, maybe I don't go for the run,

54:40.580 --> 54:42.280
 and I'll do it at two o'clock, okay, 2.05.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.940
 No, I only want to go on the half hour

54:43.940 --> 54:45.020
 or maybe on the main hour.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.100
 And you're going through all that, guess what?

54:47.100 --> 54:49.860
 You're burning up useful energy

54:49.860 --> 54:53.620
 that you could use either for the run, for example,

54:53.620 --> 54:55.020
 or for something else.

54:55.020 --> 54:58.260
 When we think about something hard, when we ruminate,

54:58.260 --> 55:02.780
 when we perseverate on an idea or on a decision,

55:02.780 --> 55:04.900
 we are burning neural energy

55:04.900 --> 55:08.340
 and neural energy is glucose and epinephrine

55:08.340 --> 55:10.440
 and all the things we talked about before.

55:10.440 --> 55:15.440
 So willpower in part is the ability to devote resources

55:16.720 --> 55:19.440
 to things and part of that is making decisions

55:19.440 --> 55:21.400
 to just either do it or not do it.

55:21.400 --> 55:23.380
 I'm not of the just do it mindset.

55:23.380 --> 55:25.720
 I think there's a right time and a place to train,

55:25.720 --> 55:29.140
 but I also think that it is not good.

55:29.140 --> 55:32.380
 In other words, it utilizes excessive resources

55:32.380 --> 55:35.420
 to churn over decisions excessively,

55:35.420 --> 55:39.300
 and you probably burn as much cognitive energy

55:39.300 --> 55:42.140
 deciding about whether or not to do a given training or not

55:42.140 --> 55:45.620
 as you do in the actual training, okay?

55:45.620 --> 55:47.980
 So we'll talk more about how this long duration effort

55:47.980 --> 55:49.700
 can relate to mental performance,

55:49.700 --> 55:52.180
 but the long duration effort should be one set,

55:52.180 --> 55:53.600
 12 minutes or longer.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.620
 It could go for 30 minutes or 60 minutes or an hour.

55:56.620 --> 55:59.080
 We'll talk about programming later in the episode.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.740
 This is going to be less than 100%

56:00.740 --> 56:03.460
 of your maximum oxygen uptake.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.340
 Your heart rate is not going to be through the ceiling

56:05.340 --> 56:09.580
 or maxed out, but it's all about efficiency of movement.

56:09.580 --> 56:11.000
 That's what you're building.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.920
 When you go out for a run that's 30 minutes,

56:12.920 --> 56:17.920
 you are building the capacity to repeat that performance

56:18.060 --> 56:20.880
 the next time while being more efficient,

56:20.880 --> 56:24.540
 actually burning less fuel, and that might seem

56:24.540 --> 56:25.740
 a little bit counterintuitive,

56:25.740 --> 56:28.340
 but every time you do that run,

56:28.340 --> 56:30.220
 what you're doing is you're building up

56:30.220 --> 56:32.080
 mitochondrial density.

56:32.080 --> 56:35.500
 It's not so much about mitochondrial oxidation

56:35.500 --> 56:36.900
 and respiration.

56:36.900 --> 56:39.240
 You're building up mitochondrial density.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.900
 You're actually increasing the amount of ATP

56:41.900 --> 56:45.140
 that you can create for a given bout of effort.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.740
 You're becoming more efficient, okay?

56:47.740 --> 56:51.960
 You're burning less fuel overall, doing the same thing.

56:51.960 --> 56:54.100
 That's really what these long slow distance

56:54.100 --> 56:56.580
 or long bouts of effort are really all about.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.620
 Now, why do this long duration effort?

56:58.620 --> 56:59.820
 Why would you want to do it?

56:59.820 --> 57:00.820
 Why is it good for you?

57:00.820 --> 57:04.500
 Well, it does something very important,

57:04.500 --> 57:08.420
 which is that it builds the capillary beds within muscles.

57:08.420 --> 57:10.300
 So let's talk a little bit about vasculature.

57:10.300 --> 57:13.060
 We haven't done this too much yet,

57:13.060 --> 57:15.540
 but if you have seen the episode

57:15.540 --> 57:16.900
 on supercharging performance,

57:16.900 --> 57:21.580
 we talked about AVAs, these arteriovenous osteomoses,

57:21.580 --> 57:26.580
 where blood moves from arteries directly into veins,

57:26.700 --> 57:28.660
 but that's unusual.

57:28.660 --> 57:33.140
 That only takes place in the so-called glabrous skin

57:33.140 --> 57:36.520
 of the palms, the face, and the bottoms of the feet.

57:36.520 --> 57:40.580
 Typically, for most all other areas of the body,

57:40.580 --> 57:45.220
 what happens is arteries bring blood to a given tissue,

57:45.220 --> 57:50.220
 like a muscle, and veins return that blood back to the heart.

57:50.740 --> 57:52.500
 There are exceptions, but in general,

57:52.500 --> 57:56.060
 and in between arteries and veins are these little tiny,

57:56.060 --> 57:58.780
 what are called capillary beds or microcapillaries.

57:58.780 --> 58:00.600
 So these are tiny little avenues,

58:00.600 --> 58:02.900
 like little tiny streams and estuaries

58:02.900 --> 58:05.460
 between the bigger arteries and veins.

58:05.460 --> 58:10.140
 Now, those are actually contained within muscle,

58:10.140 --> 58:12.600
 and what's amazing is that you can increase

58:12.600 --> 58:13.720
 the number of them.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.660
 You can literally build new capillaries.

58:15.660 --> 58:19.580
 You can create new little streams within your muscles,

58:19.580 --> 58:21.840
 and the type of long-duration effort

58:21.840 --> 58:23.100
 that I was talking about before,

58:23.100 --> 58:26.000
 12 minutes or more of steady effort,

58:26.860 --> 58:29.180
 is very useful for doing that,

58:29.180 --> 58:32.720
 and is very useful for increasing the mitochondria,

58:32.720 --> 58:35.720
 the energy-producing elements of the cells,

58:35.720 --> 58:37.860
 the actual muscle cells,

58:37.860 --> 58:42.860
 and the reason is when blood arrives to muscles,

58:42.860 --> 58:44.540
 it has oxygen,

58:44.540 --> 58:46.580
 the muscles are going to use some of that oxygen,

58:46.580 --> 58:48.500
 and then some of the deoxygenated blood

58:48.500 --> 58:51.900
 is going to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs.

58:51.900 --> 58:55.940
 Now, the more capillaries that you build into those muscles,

58:55.940 --> 58:59.820
 the more oxygen available to those muscles.

58:59.820 --> 59:02.960
 I don't want to get too much into the physics of fluid flow,

59:02.960 --> 59:05.780
 but basically it's the difference between taking a hose

59:05.780 --> 59:09.580
 and sticking it into some dirt just directly,

59:09.580 --> 59:12.500
 and turning on the faucet at a given rate,

59:12.500 --> 59:14.060
 the spigot rather,

59:14.060 --> 59:17.140
 or having a bunch of little hoses like a sprinkler system

59:17.140 --> 59:19.260
 that go out and irrigate the whole yard.

59:19.260 --> 59:22.620
 The irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system,

59:22.620 --> 59:27.420
 and it's very good at using energy sources within blood.

59:27.420 --> 59:29.820
 So the simple way to think about this is

59:29.820 --> 59:31.060
 when you go out for a run,

59:31.060 --> 59:32.760
 let's say it's the first run you've done for a while,

59:32.760 --> 59:34.660
 and you go out for 12 or 15 minutes,

59:34.660 --> 59:36.820
 and somewhere right around 20 minutes,

59:36.820 --> 59:38.960
 you're like, that's it, I just can't continue.

59:38.960 --> 59:42.140
 Well, when you come back the next time to do that run,

59:42.140 --> 59:44.440
 you've built endurance,

59:44.440 --> 59:48.220
 largely because you've built these capillary beds,

59:48.220 --> 59:50.260
 you've expanded these little streams

59:50.260 --> 59:52.900
 in which blood can deliver oxygen to the muscles.

59:52.900 --> 59:55.700
 And so it's going to feel relatively straightforward

59:55.700 --> 59:58.780
 to either go a little bit quicker for the same duration,

59:58.780 --> 59:59.980
 the same distance,

59:59.980 --> 1:00:04.220
 or to extend that run for another five to 10 minutes.

1:00:04.220 --> 1:00:07.500
 So this long duration work, unlike muscular endurance,

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:10.580
 like planks and everything that we were talking about before

1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:13.300
 is really about building the capillary systems

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:16.660
 and the mitochondria, the energy utilization systems

1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:18.900
 within the muscles themselves.

1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:21.180
 And that's very important to understand.

1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:23.080
 It's distinctly different than say,

1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:25.220
 building the neurons that fire the muscles.

1:00:25.220 --> 1:00:26.460
 The neurons are already there,

1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:28.420
 they're going to fire those muscles just fine.

1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:30.640
 In fact, if your life depended on it today,

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.340
 you could probably run a marathon.

1:00:32.340 --> 1:00:33.380
 You'd probably get injured,

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.560
 it would be very psychologically and physically painful,

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.960
 I don't recommend you do that unless you're trained for it.

1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:39.900
 But if you were to train properly for it,

1:00:39.900 --> 1:00:42.620
 if you were to do long duration bouts of effort

1:00:42.620 --> 1:00:44.960
 once or twice a week, or three times a week,

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:46.420
 pretty soon it would become easy

1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:49.080
 because you're building these vascular microbeds

1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.580
 or microvascular beds as they're called.

1:00:51.580 --> 1:00:54.660
 Okay, so you're able to bring more energy to the muscles

1:00:54.660 --> 1:00:56.940
 and they're able to utilize more energy.

1:00:56.940 --> 1:00:58.580
 So that's long duration.

1:00:58.580 --> 1:00:59.660
 So we've got muscular endurance

1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:01.380
 and we've got long duration endurance.

1:01:01.380 --> 1:01:04.340
 And then there are two kinds in between

1:01:04.340 --> 1:01:07.460
 that in recent years have gotten a lot of attention

1:01:07.460 --> 1:01:08.560
 and excitement,

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:10.240
 but most people are not distinguishing

1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:13.540
 between these two kinds of endurance.

1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:17.020
 And that's a shame because in failing to distinguish

1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:18.500
 between the two kinds of what we call

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:20.220
 high intensity training,

1:01:20.220 --> 1:01:23.260
 sometimes called high intensity interval training,

1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:25.340
 most people, perhaps you,

1:01:25.340 --> 1:01:29.740
 are not getting nearly as much physical and mental benefit

1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:32.100
 out of high intensity training as you could.

1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:33.700
 So I want to talk about the two kinds

1:01:33.700 --> 1:01:35.820
 of high intensity interval training

1:01:35.820 --> 1:01:38.860
 and what each of them does for your brain and body

1:01:38.860 --> 1:01:41.520
 and what sorts of adaptations they cause,

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:42.960
 because in doing that,

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:46.780
 you can really start to build up specific energy systems

1:01:46.780 --> 1:01:49.940
 in your brain and body in ways that best serve you

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:52.540
 for your cognitive work

1:01:52.540 --> 1:01:55.860
 and for other sorts of things like strength and speed

1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:59.580
 or hypertrophy or for running marathons for that matter.

1:01:59.580 --> 1:02:02.660
 So there are two kinds of high intensity training

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:03.580
 for endurance,

1:02:03.580 --> 1:02:06.200
 sometimes called high intensity interval training.

1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:11.380
 One is anaerobic, so-called anaerobic endurance,

1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:12.480
 so no oxygen,

1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:14.620
 and the other is aerobic endurance,

1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:17.840
 both of which qualify as HIIT,

1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:19.120
 high intensity interval training.

1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.760
 So let's talk about anaerobic endurance first.

1:02:22.700 --> 1:02:26.580
 Anaerobic endurance from a protocol perspective

1:02:26.580 --> 1:02:31.580
 is going to be three to 12 sets, okay?

1:02:31.580 --> 1:02:34.680
 And these repetitions,

1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:37.140
 and I'll talk about what the repetitions are,

1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:40.260
 are going to be performed at whatever speed

1:02:40.260 --> 1:02:44.660
 allows you to complete the work in good, safe form, okay?

1:02:44.660 --> 1:02:46.500
 So it could be fast, it could be slow.

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:48.500
 As the work continues,

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:51.780
 your repetitions may slow down or it may speed up.

1:02:51.780 --> 1:02:52.980
 Chances are it's going to slow down.

1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:54.740
 So what does this work?

1:02:54.740 --> 1:02:56.160
 What do these sets look like?

1:02:56.160 --> 1:02:59.020
 Remember, long, slow distance is one set.

1:02:59.020 --> 1:03:01.020
 Muscular endurance is three to five sets.

1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:03.100
 High intensity anaerobic endurance

1:03:03.100 --> 1:03:07.260
 is going to be somewhere between three and 12 sets.

1:03:07.260 --> 1:03:11.540
 And it's going to have a ratio of work to rest

1:03:11.540 --> 1:03:16.460
 of anywhere from three to one to one to five, okay?

1:03:16.460 --> 1:03:20.860
 So what would a three to one ratio set look like?

1:03:20.860 --> 1:03:24.160
 Well, it's going to be 30 seconds of hard pedaling

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:28.660
 on the bike, for instance, or running, or on the rower.

1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:29.780
 These are just examples.

1:03:29.780 --> 1:03:31.220
 It could be in the pool swimming.

1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:33.300
 It could be any number of things or air squats

1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:35.740
 or weighted squats, if you will,

1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:38.460
 provided you can manage that.

1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:41.400
 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.

1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:43.180
 That's a very brief rest.

1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:45.380
 So three to one is just a good example

1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:47.440
 would be 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.

1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:52.460
 The opposite extreme on that ratio would be one to five.

1:03:52.460 --> 1:03:55.320
 So 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off.

1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:57.460
 So you do the work for 20 seconds,

1:03:57.460 --> 1:03:59.260
 then you rest 100 seconds.

1:03:59.260 --> 1:04:01.200
 Now what's the difference?

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:03.620
 Should you do three to one ratio?

1:04:03.620 --> 1:04:05.960
 So 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:08.020
 or should you do one to five,

1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:10.260
 20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?

1:04:10.260 --> 1:04:13.220
 Well, that will depend on whether or not

1:04:13.220 --> 1:04:16.680
 the quality of the movement is important to you.

1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:19.240
 So let's just take a look at the three to one ratio.

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:21.500
 So in the three to one ratio,

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:25.140
 if you're going to do 30 seconds of hard pedaling on a bike

1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:26.180
 followed by 10 seconds,

1:04:26.180 --> 1:04:28.580
 so maybe one of these, what they call assault bikes,

1:04:28.580 --> 1:04:31.060
 and then you stop for 10 seconds and then repeat,

1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:36.060
 chances are you will be able to do one, two, three, four,

1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:39.160
 maybe even as many as 12 sets

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:41.240
 if you're really in good condition,

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:42.440
 that you'll be able to do all those

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:45.220
 because pedaling on the bike doesn't require a ton of skill.

1:04:45.220 --> 1:04:47.900
 And if you do it incorrectly,

1:04:47.900 --> 1:04:49.800
 if your elbow flares out a little bit or something,

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:51.520
 it's very unlikely that you'll get injured

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:54.140
 unless it's really extreme, okay?

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:57.200
 But the same movement done, for instance, with kettlebells,

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:59.360
 so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,

1:05:00.420 --> 1:05:02.180
 the first set will probably be in good form.

1:05:02.180 --> 1:05:03.900
 The second one will be in pretty good form,

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:05.660
 but let's say you're getting to the fifth and sixth set

1:05:05.660 --> 1:05:07.740
 and you're going 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,

1:05:07.740 --> 1:05:10.560
 chances are the quality of your repetitions

1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:11.900
 will degrade significantly

1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:13.220
 and you increase the probability

1:05:13.220 --> 1:05:15.020
 that you're going to get injured

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:18.040
 or that you're going to damage yourself in some way

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:20.060
 or that you can't complete the movement

1:05:20.060 --> 1:05:21.460
 or that some smaller muscles

1:05:21.460 --> 1:05:24.060
 like your grip muscles might give out, okay?

1:05:24.060 --> 1:05:26.860
 So the quality of repetitions is going to drop

1:05:26.860 --> 1:05:30.040
 considerably with the three-to-one approach.

1:05:31.020 --> 1:05:32.600
 If you're just doing it for effort,

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:34.620
 and we'll talk about what this builds in your system

1:05:34.620 --> 1:05:36.220
 in a moment, that's fine.

1:05:36.220 --> 1:05:41.220
 But for most people, if quality of form is important,

1:05:41.300 --> 1:05:44.620
 so maybe this is using weights, maybe you're doing squats,

1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:47.540
 so you're going to do 20 seconds on and 100 seconds of rest,

1:05:47.540 --> 1:05:49.280
 maybe it's even a barbell-loaded squat,

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:50.800
 maybe you're doing kettlebells,

1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:53.920
 maybe you've got some other resistance there

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:55.700
 that's allowing you to do this,

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:57.580
 what you'll find is that the longer rest,

1:05:57.580 --> 1:06:00.280
 even though it's 20 seconds of intense effort

1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:02.420
 followed by a longer rest of about 100 seconds

1:06:02.420 --> 1:06:05.540
 will allow you to perform more quality repetitions

1:06:05.540 --> 1:06:07.780
 safely over time.

1:06:07.780 --> 1:06:12.780
 So what does building anaerobic endurance look like?

1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:15.360
 And then I'll tell you what it's actually good for

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:17.680
 in the true practical sense.

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:22.420
 What anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like

1:06:22.420 --> 1:06:25.100
 is that if you decide to do this for the first week,

1:06:25.100 --> 1:06:27.100
 you might do this two or three times a week,

1:06:27.100 --> 1:06:28.580
 maybe even just once a week,

1:06:28.580 --> 1:06:29.860
 depending on the other things you're doing,

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.820
 we'll talk about programming at the end,

1:06:31.820 --> 1:06:34.080
 and you would generate just three sets,

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:37.460
 so it might be three sets of 20 seconds of hard effort

1:06:37.460 --> 1:06:39.380
 followed by 100 seconds rest,

1:06:39.380 --> 1:06:40.960
 then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,

1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:44.260
 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds of effort, 100 seconds rest,

1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:46.300
 and you might do that twice a week,

1:06:46.300 --> 1:06:50.780
 and then each week you're adding one or two sets, okay?

1:06:50.780 --> 1:06:52.780
 In doing that, you will build up

1:06:52.780 --> 1:06:54.780
 what we call anaerobic endurance.

1:06:54.780 --> 1:06:56.780
 What is anaerobic endurance?

1:06:56.780 --> 1:06:59.340
 Well, let's ask why we fail.

1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:03.900
 Anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system

1:07:03.900 --> 1:07:08.420
 into greater than 100% of your VO2 max.

1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.440
 It's going to be taking your heart rate up very high,

1:07:12.340 --> 1:07:17.340
 and it's going to maximize your oxygen utilization systems.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:20.260
 That is going to have effects

1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:23.220
 that are going to lead to fatigue

1:07:23.220 --> 1:07:24.640
 at some point in the workout,

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:27.200
 and that fatigue will trigger an adaptation,

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:30.300
 so let's ask what adaptation it's triggering.

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:35.080
 Well, it's triggering both mitochondrial respiration,

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.220
 the ability of your mitochondria to generate more energy

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:40.780
 by using more oxygen because you're bringing so,

1:07:40.780 --> 1:07:41.860
 you're maxing out,

1:07:41.860 --> 1:07:44.200
 literally you're getting above your VO2 max.

1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:46.620
 You're hitting that threshold of how much oxygen

1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:48.020
 you can use in your system.

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:50.680
 One of the adaptations will be that your mitochondria

1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:55.340
 will shift such that they can use more oxygen,

1:07:55.340 --> 1:08:00.060
 and you're going to also increase the capillary beds,

1:08:00.060 --> 1:08:02.900
 but not as much as you're going to be able

1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:07.580
 to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle.

1:08:07.580 --> 1:08:09.980
 So normally when we start to hit fatigue,

1:08:09.980 --> 1:08:12.760
 when we're exhausted, when we're breathing really hard,

1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:14.380
 because the systems of the body are linked

1:08:14.380 --> 1:08:16.460
 and there's a mental component to this as well,

1:08:16.460 --> 1:08:18.780
 a kind of motivational component,

1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:21.900
 after that third or fourth or sixth set of,

1:08:21.900 --> 1:08:23.580
 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off,

1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:24.620
 or if you're at the other extreme,

1:08:24.620 --> 1:08:26.780
 30 seconds on and 10 seconds off,

1:08:26.780 --> 1:08:29.820
 there's going to be a component of you want to stop

1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:32.940
 and by pushing through and repeating another set safely,

1:08:32.940 --> 1:08:37.420
 of course, what you're doing is you're training the neurons

1:08:37.420 --> 1:08:40.540
 to be able to access more energy,

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:43.380
 literally convert that into ATP and for the muscles

1:08:43.380 --> 1:08:45.920
 therefore to access more energy and ATP,

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:49.500
 and the adaptation is in the mitochondria's ability

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:53.480
 to use oxygen, and this has tremendous carryover effects

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.720
 for other types of exercise.

1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:58.260
 So while I know and appreciate that people

1:08:58.260 --> 1:09:00.100
 are using high-intensity interval training

1:09:00.100 --> 1:09:04.900
 of this kind or similar in order to just like burn fat,

1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:06.540
 do their workouts, quote unquote,

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.020
 it's very useful for building a capacity

1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:14.540
 to engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly,

1:09:14.540 --> 1:09:17.440
 to really lock in, I don't want to use the word focus

1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:18.960
 because it's not strictly mental focus,

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:23.960
 but to be able to generate short bouts of very intense work.

1:09:24.100 --> 1:09:27.540
 This can be beneficial in competitive sports or team sports

1:09:27.540 --> 1:09:28.840
 where there's a sprinting component,

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:30.740
 where the field opens up and you need to dribble the ball

1:09:30.740 --> 1:09:33.000
 down the field, for instance, and shoot on goal,

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.640
 or where you're playing tennis and it's a long rally

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:38.980
 and then all of a sudden somebody really starts

1:09:38.980 --> 1:09:40.180
 putting you back on your heels

1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:42.860
 and you have to really make the maximum amount of effort

1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:45.400
 to run to the net and to get the ball across the net,

1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:48.180
 things of that sort, okay?

1:09:48.180 --> 1:09:50.280
 There are a variety of places where there's carryover

1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:53.740
 from this type of training, but it does support endurance.

1:09:53.740 --> 1:09:55.120
 It's about muscle endurance.

1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:58.820
 It's about these muscles ability to generate a lot of force

1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:01.200
 in the short term, but repeatedly, okay?

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.020
 So that's the way to conceptualize this.

1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:05.540
 And it is different than maximum power.

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:07.660
 Even though it feels like maximum effort,

1:10:07.660 --> 1:10:10.860
 it is not the same as building power and speed into muscles.

1:10:10.860 --> 1:10:13.220
 Those are distinctly different protocols.

1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:15.420
 So the key elements, again,

1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:18.300
 are that you're bringing your breathing

1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:22.260
 and your oxygen utilization way up above your max.

1:10:22.260 --> 1:10:24.460
 It's not quite hitting failure,

1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:27.180
 but you're really pushing the system to the point

1:10:27.180 --> 1:10:29.740
 where you are not ready to do another set

1:10:29.740 --> 1:10:31.280
 and yet you begin another set.

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.800
 You're not necessarily psychologically ready.

1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:35.620
 I'll talk more about some of the adaptations

1:10:35.620 --> 1:10:38.340
 that this causes in terms of stroke volume

1:10:38.340 --> 1:10:40.100
 in a few minutes when we talk about

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:42.140
 how it is that work of this sort

1:10:42.140 --> 1:10:45.100
 can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood

1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:47.180
 and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues.

1:10:47.180 --> 1:10:50.060
 I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe

1:10:50.060 --> 1:10:51.860
 during these different types of protocols

1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:53.340
 and what's happening at the level of the heart.

1:10:53.340 --> 1:10:55.820
 But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol,

1:10:55.820 --> 1:10:59.100
 which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning.

1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:02.140
 So HIIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic.

1:11:02.140 --> 1:11:04.900
 And you just heard about anaerobic.

1:11:04.900 --> 1:11:07.380
 High-intensity aerobic conditioning

1:11:07.380 --> 1:11:11.940
 also involves about three to 12 sets starting off,

1:11:11.940 --> 1:11:13.580
 of course, with fewer sets

1:11:13.580 --> 1:11:14.780
 as you're getting into this training

1:11:14.780 --> 1:11:17.060
 and then extending into more sets

1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:19.420
 as one parameter you could expand.

1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:22.380
 Has, again, the same ratio of three to one,

1:11:22.380 --> 1:11:24.920
 so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off, or one to five,

1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:26.740
 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off,

1:11:26.740 --> 1:11:30.080
 or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic conditioning

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:32.820
 is a one-to-one ratio.

1:11:32.820 --> 1:11:35.900
 A one-to-one ratio is powerful

1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:38.340
 for building, on average,

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:42.020
 most of the energy systems involving,

1:11:42.020 --> 1:11:44.900
 remember, we had these nerve, muscle, blood,

1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:46.260
 heart, and lungs.

1:11:46.260 --> 1:11:50.780
 A one-to-one ratio might be you run a mile

1:11:50.780 --> 1:11:52.100
 and however long that takes,

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:54.260
 let's say it takes you six minutes or seven minutes,

1:11:54.260 --> 1:11:56.660
 then you rest for an equivalent amount of time,

1:11:57.520 --> 1:11:58.760
 then you repeat,

1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:01.380
 and then you rest for an equivalent amount of time.

1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:04.340
 So you might run, first mile is, let's say, seven minutes,

1:12:04.340 --> 1:12:05.440
 then you rest for seven minutes,

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:06.460
 then you run a mile again,

1:12:06.460 --> 1:12:08.440
 and it might take eight minutes,

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:09.340
 and you rest for eight minutes,

1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:13.220
 and you continue that for a total of four miles of work,

1:12:13.220 --> 1:12:16.460
 for four miles of running work, I should say,

1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:17.880
 or seven miles of work.

1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:19.020
 You can build this up.

1:12:19.020 --> 1:12:22.540
 Many people find that using this type of training

1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:26.100
 allows them to do things like go run half marathons

1:12:26.100 --> 1:12:29.560
 and marathons, even though prior to the race date,

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:32.700
 they've never actually run a half marathon or marathon.

1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:34.740
 Now, that might seem incredible.

1:12:34.740 --> 1:12:37.260
 It's like, how could it be that running a mile on

1:12:37.260 --> 1:12:41.500
 and then resting for an equivalent amount of time,

1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:43.620
 running a mile, resting for equivalent amount of time

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:46.900
 for seven miles allows you to run continuously

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:50.420
 for 13 miles or for 26 miles?

1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:52.180
 Well, I'm not discouraging people

1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:54.660
 from ever doing the long duration endurance.

1:12:54.660 --> 1:12:56.420
 I think that is very important,

1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:58.840
 but it's because it builds up

1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:01.780
 so many of these energy utilization systems.

1:13:01.780 --> 1:13:04.620
 It really teaches you to engage, excuse me,

1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:06.780
 the nerve to muscle firing.

1:13:06.780 --> 1:13:11.780
 It improves ATP and mitochondrial function in muscle.

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:15.380
 It allows the blood to deliver more oxygen

1:13:15.380 --> 1:13:17.900
 to the muscle and to your brain.

1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:19.820
 And I'll explain how that is.

1:13:19.820 --> 1:13:24.420
 And it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen overall.

1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:26.620
 And it builds a tremendous lung capacity.

1:13:26.620 --> 1:13:28.540
 And we will talk about exactly how to breathe

1:13:28.540 --> 1:13:30.380
 and how to build lung capacity,

1:13:30.380 --> 1:13:32.700
 both for sake of warming up and for performance.

1:13:32.700 --> 1:13:33.740
 So what would this look like

1:13:33.740 --> 1:13:35.920
 and when should you do this?

1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:39.500
 Well, it's really a question for these workouts

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:43.820
 of asking how much work can one do in eight to 12 minutes?

1:13:43.820 --> 1:13:45.540
 And then rest and then repeat.

1:13:45.540 --> 1:13:47.260
 How much work can you do for eight to 12 minutes,

1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:48.200
 then rest and then repeat?

1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:50.120
 And how many times should you do this?

1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:53.060
 Well, this is the sort of thing, it's pretty intense.

1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:55.360
 And so you would probably only want to do this

1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:57.240
 two, maybe three times a week

1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:58.780
 if you're not doing many other things.

1:13:58.780 --> 1:14:01.580
 I will talk about how this program can be moved in

1:14:01.580 --> 1:14:02.620
 with other forms of training,

1:14:02.620 --> 1:14:04.480
 but I'll just give you a little hint now.

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.460
 It's very clear.

1:14:06.460 --> 1:14:09.860
 And it's described in the review article referred to,

1:14:09.860 --> 1:14:12.300
 and we will link another article as well.

1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:14.860
 That concurrent training, doing strength training

1:14:14.860 --> 1:14:17.280
 and the endurance training of any of the four kinds

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:19.740
 that I'm describing today can be done.

1:14:19.740 --> 1:14:21.700
 You can program those in the same week,

1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:24.940
 but you want to get four and ideally six

1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:28.260
 or even better 24 hours between these workouts

1:14:28.260 --> 1:14:30.700
 because it is very hard, for instance,

1:14:30.700 --> 1:14:33.380
 to do a one-to-one mile repeats

1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:35.200
 like run a mile, rest for equivalent time,

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:36.860
 run a mile, rest for equivalent time,

1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:38.560
 to do that two or three times a week

1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:40.380
 and also do weight training before

1:14:40.380 --> 1:14:42.340
 or do a long run afterwards.

1:14:42.340 --> 1:14:45.080
 That would quickly lead to breakdown for most people

1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:48.940
 unless you have very, very good energy utilization systems.

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:52.060
 You're a really kind of advanced or elite athlete

1:14:52.060 --> 1:14:55.460
 and or dare I say you're using tools

1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.680
 to enhance your performance at the level of blood

1:14:57.680 --> 1:14:58.520
 or hormones.

1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:00.140
 And I'm actually going to talk about those at the end

1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:01.580
 and why they work.

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:04.380
 So we have four kinds of endurance, muscular endurance.

1:15:04.380 --> 1:15:05.980
 We have long duration endurance.

1:15:05.980 --> 1:15:08.140
 We have high intensity interval training of two kinds,

1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:09.860
 anaerobic and aerobic.

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:13.820
 And this last type, the aerobic one works best it seems

1:15:13.820 --> 1:15:15.540
 if you kind of do this one-to-one ratio.

1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:18.340
 So how would you use these and what are they actually doing?

1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:21.880
 Let's talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen

1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:24.540
 because that's something that we can all benefit

1:15:24.540 --> 1:15:25.940
 from understanding.

1:15:25.940 --> 1:15:28.660
 And it will become very clear in that discussion

1:15:28.660 --> 1:15:31.260
 why this type of training is very useful

1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:34.780
 even for non-athletes in order to improve oxygenation

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:38.500
 and energy utilization of the brain and the heart.

1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:40.060
 The brain and the heart are probably

1:15:40.060 --> 1:15:41.420
 the two most important systems

1:15:41.420 --> 1:15:43.300
 that you need to take care of in your life.

1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:46.120
 Yes, your musculature needs to be maintained.

1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:47.940
 If you want to build it, that's up to you,

1:15:47.940 --> 1:15:50.020
 but you should try and maintain your musculature

1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:52.980
 but maintaining or enhancing a brain function

1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:54.740
 and cardiovascular function.

1:15:54.740 --> 1:15:58.100
 It's absolutely clear our key for health and longevity

1:15:58.100 --> 1:15:59.260
 in the short and long-term.

1:15:59.260 --> 1:16:01.180
 And the sorts of training I talked about today

1:16:01.180 --> 1:16:03.180
 has been shown again and again and again

1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:07.640
 to be very useful for enhancing the strength of the mind.

1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:09.220
 Yes, I'll talk about that.

1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:12.540
 As well as the health of the brain and the body.

1:16:12.540 --> 1:16:14.500
 So let's talk about the sorts of adaptations

1:16:14.500 --> 1:16:16.080
 that are happening in your brain and body

1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:19.940
 that are so beneficial in these different forms of training.

1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:23.120
 If you are breathing hard and your heart is beating hard,

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:27.540
 so this would be certainly in the high-intensity anaerobic

1:16:27.540 --> 1:16:28.660
 and aerobic conditioning,

1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:30.820
 because you're getting up near your VO2 max

1:16:30.820 --> 1:16:32.920
 in high-intensity aerobic conditioning,

1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:34.820
 and you're exceeding your VO2 max

1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:38.700
 in high-intensity anaerobic conditioning,

1:16:38.700 --> 1:16:39.780
 what's going to happen is,

1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:42.320
 as of course your heart beats faster,

1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:46.120
 your blood is going to be circulating faster in principle.

1:16:46.980 --> 1:16:50.320
 Oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up.

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:54.780
 And over time, not long, very quickly,

1:16:54.780 --> 1:16:56.800
 what will happen when those capillary beds

1:16:56.800 --> 1:16:58.880
 start to expand, we talked about that.

1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:05.300
 But in addition, because of the amount of blood

1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:07.220
 that's being returned to the heart,

1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:10.560
 when you engage in these really intense bouts of effort,

1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:14.840
 repeatedly, the amount of blood being returned to the heart

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:18.140
 actually causes an eccentric loading

1:17:18.140 --> 1:17:21.500
 of one of the muscular walls of the heart.

1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:23.880
 So your heart is muscle, it's cardiac muscle.

1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:25.380
 We have skeletal muscle attached to our bones

1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:28.340
 and we have cardiac muscle, which is our heart.

1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:31.100
 When more blood is being returned to the heart

1:17:31.100 --> 1:17:32.700
 because of the additional work

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.840
 that your muscles and nerves are doing,

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:40.740
 it actually has the effect of creating an eccentric loading,

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:45.740
 a kind of pushing of the wall, the left wall.

1:17:45.980 --> 1:17:48.000
 I realize I'm not using the strict anatomy here,

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.420
 but I don't want to get into all the features of,

1:17:50.420 --> 1:17:52.540
 the structural features of the heart.

1:17:52.540 --> 1:17:57.540
 But the left ventricle essentially getting slammed back

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.540
 and then having to push back

1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:03.180
 in a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle

1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:05.160
 and the muscle thickens,

1:18:06.380 --> 1:18:09.020
 but not because the heart thickens overall,

1:18:09.020 --> 1:18:11.980
 it's actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle

1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:15.100
 in a way that increases what we call stroke volume.

1:18:15.100 --> 1:18:18.000
 Meaning as more blood is returned to the heart,

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.020
 there's an adaptation where the heart muscle

1:18:20.020 --> 1:18:24.520
 actually gets stronger and therefore can pump more blood

1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:26.340
 per stroke, per beat.

1:18:26.340 --> 1:18:29.860
 And as it does that, it delivers,

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:34.080
 because blood contains glucose and oxygen and other things,

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:36.420
 it delivers more fuel to your muscles,

1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:40.300
 which allows you to do yet more work per unit time.

1:18:40.300 --> 1:18:43.620
 So when we hear that, oh, so-and-so has a,

1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:46.780
 or maybe you have a nice low heart rate

1:18:46.780 --> 1:18:48.980
 that maybe you're one of these really extreme folks

1:18:48.980 --> 1:18:50.620
 like 30 or 40 beats per minute,

1:18:50.620 --> 1:18:53.100
 although most people are sitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,

1:18:53.100 --> 1:18:54.680
 that's your resting heart rate.

1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:56.180
 If you exercise regularly

1:18:56.180 --> 1:18:59.000
 and you do long duration aerobic work,

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.780
 your heart rate will start to go down,

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:02.860
 your resting heart rate.

1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:05.380
 It will increase the stroke volume of your heart.

1:19:05.380 --> 1:19:07.560
 If you do this high intensity type training

1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:09.340
 where your heart is beating very hard,

1:19:09.340 --> 1:19:12.760
 so maybe the one-to-one ratio mile run repeats

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:14.060
 that I described a minute ago,

1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:17.220
 let's say you do that twice a week for three or four,

1:19:17.220 --> 1:19:20.100
 and I said it could go all the way up to 12 sets,

1:19:20.100 --> 1:19:22.520
 which is a lot, I don't recommend people start there.

1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:25.180
 Pretty soon, the stroke volume of your heart

1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:27.100
 will really increase, and as a consequence,

1:19:27.100 --> 1:19:31.460
 you can deliver more fuel to your muscles and to your brain,

1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:35.460
 and you will notice that you can do more work,

1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:37.600
 meaning you can do the same work you were doing a few days

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:40.200
 or weeks ago with relative ease.

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:42.880
 Your cognitive functioning will improve.

1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:44.780
 This has been shown again and again

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:46.940
 because there's an increase in vasculature,

1:19:46.940 --> 1:19:48.840
 literally capillary beds within the brain,

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:51.500
 the hippocampus areas that support memory,

1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:54.660
 but also areas of the brain that support respiration,

1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:57.320
 that support focus, that support effort.

1:19:57.320 --> 1:19:58.620
 This isn't often discussed,

1:19:58.620 --> 1:20:00.780
 but the ability to deliver more blood

1:20:00.780 --> 1:20:02.260
 and therefore more glucose,

1:20:02.260 --> 1:20:05.660
 remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain

1:20:05.660 --> 1:20:09.540
 is a big feature of why exercise of the kind I'm describing

1:20:09.540 --> 1:20:11.800
 helps with brain function.

1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:15.620
 Now, weight training does have some positive effects

1:20:15.620 --> 1:20:16.980
 on brain function also.

1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:18.940
 When I say weight training, I'm really,

1:20:18.940 --> 1:20:20.160
 I should be more specific,

1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:23.420
 I really am referring to strength and hypertrophy training.

1:20:23.420 --> 1:20:25.600
 Strength and hypertrophy training,

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:28.380
 especially if it's of the sort where you get into the burn,

1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:29.660
 as we talked about last episode,

1:20:29.660 --> 1:20:32.080
 and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal

1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:33.980
 that can benefit your brain, et cetera,

1:20:33.980 --> 1:20:36.620
 it can have positive effects on the brain.

1:20:36.620 --> 1:20:38.900
 And frankly, there haven't been as many studies

1:20:38.900 --> 1:20:40.460
 of resistance training,

1:20:40.460 --> 1:20:43.020
 strength and hypertrophy training on brain function,

1:20:43.020 --> 1:20:45.100
 mainly because most of those experiments

1:20:45.100 --> 1:20:48.640
 are done in mice or primates, non-human primates,

1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:49.480
 I should say,

1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:53.260
 and it's hard to get mice to do resistance training, okay?

1:20:53.260 --> 1:20:55.220
 It's hard to get humans to do resistance training.

1:20:55.220 --> 1:20:57.100
 It's definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training.

1:20:57.100 --> 1:20:58.100
 There are ways to do it,

1:20:58.100 --> 1:21:00.580
 but it's hard to get them to do, say,

1:21:00.580 --> 1:21:02.420
 three sets of eight on the deadlift

1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:04.580
 and then do some curls and then do some chin ups

1:21:04.580 --> 1:21:05.660
 and this kind of thing, okay?

1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:08.500
 It's pretty easy to get a mouse to run on a treadmill

1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:10.940
 and you can set the tension on that treadmill

1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:13.220
 to make it so that it's easier or harder

1:21:13.220 --> 1:21:15.500
 for the mouse to turn that wheel.

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:17.440
 So that's one of the reasons.

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:19.540
 However, it's very clear

1:21:19.540 --> 1:21:21.540
 and you should now understand intuitively

1:21:21.540 --> 1:21:23.780
 why the kind of standard strength

1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:25.300
 and hypertrophy type workouts

1:21:25.300 --> 1:21:29.860
 are not going to activate the blood oxygenation

1:21:29.860 --> 1:21:32.660
 and the stroke volume increases for the heart

1:21:32.660 --> 1:21:35.360
 that the sorts of training I'm talking about today will,

1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:38.680
 it just doesn't have the same positive effects.

1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:41.040
 Now, that isn't to say that if you just weight train,

1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:41.880
 that you'll be dumb

1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:44.420
 or that you'll lose your memory over time.

1:21:44.420 --> 1:21:48.560
 You might, but it is to say that endurance work,

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:52.160
 in particular, the high intensity and long duration work

1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:53.080
 that I've talked about today,

1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:56.300
 the two high intensity protocols and the long duration work

1:21:56.300 --> 1:21:58.520
 has been shown again and again and again

1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:00.780
 to have positive effects on brain function,

1:22:00.780 --> 1:22:02.540
 not through the addition of new neurons.

1:22:02.540 --> 1:22:04.020
 Sorry to break it to you,

1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:06.180
 but that's not a major event

1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:10.060
 in the exercised or non-exercised human brain

1:22:10.060 --> 1:22:12.600
 for reasons we can talk about in a future episode,

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:15.040
 but it still has many positive effects

1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:17.820
 through the delivery of things like IGF-1,

1:22:17.820 --> 1:22:21.660
 but also just through plain oxygenation of the brain

1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:25.700
 and the way it promotes the development of microvasculature

1:22:25.700 --> 1:22:30.020
 to develop, excuse me, to deliver neurons more nutrients.

1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:33.440
 If neurons don't get oxygen and glucose, they do die,

1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:36.180
 unless there's another fuel source like ketones,

1:22:36.180 --> 1:22:37.680
 which can replace the glucose.

1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:41.280
 If you don't give oxygen to neurons,

1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:43.200
 if you don't deliver enough to them,

1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:44.520
 you get what's called ischemia,

1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:45.960
 you get little micro strokes.

1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:48.880
 So the type of exercise I'm talking about today

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:52.000
 in generating intense heart rate increases,

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000
 provided that's safe for you to do, breathing hard,

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.680
 that's going to deliver oxygen and blood,

1:22:56.680 --> 1:22:59.280
 increase stroke volume of the heart,

1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:01.880
 and is going to improve brain function.

1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.160
 This has been supported by many,

1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:05.560
 many quality peer reviewed studies.

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:08.800
 So that's one form of positive adaptation.

1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:11.140
 I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations,

1:23:11.140 --> 1:23:13.640
 how doing high intensity aerobic conditioning

1:23:13.640 --> 1:23:16.320
 of the, you know, mile repeats type training

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:18.020
 can actually improve your ability

1:23:18.020 --> 1:23:20.800
 to do long bouts of intense work.

1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:23.440
 It also seems like it dovetails

1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:26.040
 or is compatible with resistance training

1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:28.400
 that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy.

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.320
 Now in full disclosure, the data seemed to indicate

1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:33.960
 that if people just weight train or train for strength,

1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:37.000
 so three reps, rest five minutes,

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.560
 three reps of heavy weights, et cetera,

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:40.960
 yeah, you'll get much stronger than you would

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:42.880
 if you're doing things like, you know,

1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:46.080
 five repetitions up to 12 or 12 to 25 reps,

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:48.340
 and you're, you know, and you're going out for long jogs.

1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:49.980
 There's always going to be a compromise

1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:51.900
 in adaptations, unfortunately.

1:23:51.900 --> 1:23:53.940
 It does seem like you can do concurrent training,

1:23:53.940 --> 1:23:56.220
 as I mentioned before, if you allow anywhere from four

1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:59.580
 to six or ideally 24 hours between workouts.

1:23:59.580 --> 1:24:01.200
 As I mentioned in the previous episode,

1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:04.320
 if you want to know if you are recovered from a workout,

1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:05.880
 a great way to do that is to apply

1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:08.040
 the carbon dioxide tolerance test,

1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:10.320
 which is four breaths in and out, inhale, exhale,

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:12.380
 inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:16.020
 then a big inhale, and then a slow controlled exhale.

1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:20.400
 If that slow controlled exhale is 60 seconds or longer,

1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:22.080
 it means that your parasympathetic,

1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:24.700
 your calming nervous system is under your control,

1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:26.560
 and it's likely, I should say likely,

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:29.320
 that systemically your whole nervous system has recovered

1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:30.760
 from whatever it is that you've been doing

1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:33.440
 and experiencing in life, including work and relationships.

1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:37.720
 If not, you might want to take a rest day, dare I say,

1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:41.220
 or Costello is on his, what, he's 10 now,

1:24:41.220 --> 1:24:44.600
 I think he's on his 12,000th rest day.

1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.760
 Most people need, I should say,

1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:48.960
 one to two full rest days per week.

1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:49.960
 I know there are people who are going to say,

1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:51.360
 that's ridiculous, and okay,

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:54.960
 maybe you have amazing recovery abilities.

1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:56.460
 Also depends on training intensity.

1:24:56.460 --> 1:24:58.240
 Many people benefit from having one or two

1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.920
 full rest days per week, at least one.

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:02.260
 Some people don't need to,

1:25:02.260 --> 1:25:06.280
 but if you are not able to extend that exhale

1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:08.680
 on the carbon dioxide tolerance test

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:12.640
 past 60 seconds or so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds,

1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.080
 chances are your so-called sympathetic nervous system,

1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:18.240
 your stress system is chronically elevated

1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:20.300
 and you're not really putting the brake

1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:23.160
 on that system enough, and that's a subconscious thing.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:25.680
 There are ways that you can accelerate recovery,

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:28.100
 but I would encourage you to listen to the previous episode.

1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:30.840
 It's timestamped for how to assess recovery.

1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:32.440
 So how often to program these things

1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:34.640
 will depend on the other things you're doing.

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:36.000
 I think it's perfectly reasonable

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.340
 to do this type of training with other types of training,

1:25:39.340 --> 1:25:41.900
 and I'll talk about a variety of combinations of those

1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:44.220
 toward the end of the episode.

1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:46.240
 I do want to talk about how to deliver

1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:48.640
 more energy and oxygen.

1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:51.880
 These are tools that are extremely useful, I believe,

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:54.400
 and that are grounded in physiology.

1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:57.000
 The three things I'd like to talk about

1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.200
 are how to breathe,

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:03.840
 what to do immediately after training, and hydration.

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.440
 And I promise I will get back into programming

1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.380
 and sort of protocols, but these are vitally important

1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:13.620
 to your ability to perform endurance work in particular,

1:26:13.620 --> 1:26:18.260
 and they are grounded in how neurons and blood and oxygen

1:26:18.260 --> 1:26:19.640
 and your heart work together.

1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:22.800
 So let's first talk about breathing or respiration.

1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:25.540
 We breathe a couple of different ways,

1:26:25.540 --> 1:26:27.360
 but let's just remind ourselves why we breathe.

1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:30.040
 We breathe to bring oxygen into our system,

1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:32.460
 and we breathe to get rid of carbon dioxide.

1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:35.400
 And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide

1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:39.000
 in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work.

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.360
 It's not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad.

1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.240
 They have to be present in the appropriate ratios.

1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:48.200
 So one thing that is very clear

1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:51.280
 is our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:54.720
 and to our brain is going to be important

1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:57.320
 for our ability to generate muscular effort,

1:26:57.320 --> 1:26:59.480
 especially of the kind I was talking about today,

1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:00.560
 but also weight training

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:03.040
 and other forms of skill-based effort, et cetera,

1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:04.840
 and our ability to think.

1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.320
 If you're holding your breath for too long,

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:07.940
 if you're breathing too much,

1:27:07.940 --> 1:27:10.120
 if you're what they call over-breathing or under-breathing,

1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:12.040
 if you're shallow breathing, if you're mouth breathing,

1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:14.920
 these are all things that can really impede

1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:16.160
 mental and physical performance.

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:17.780
 So let's make it really simple,

1:27:17.780 --> 1:27:19.580
 and then I promise to do a future episode

1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:21.180
 all about respiration.

1:27:21.180 --> 1:27:24.860
 There are two main sources of air for your body,

1:27:24.860 --> 1:27:26.280
 and it's air coming in through your nose

1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:27.640
 and air coming in through your mouth.

1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:30.760
 In general, nasal breathing is better.

1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:34.540
 It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:37.600
 You have a microbiome in your nose that benefits.

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:38.840
 There are a number of reasons.

1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:41.280
 It's also just a more efficient system, believe it or not.

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:42.880
 Even though it feels like you can gulp more air

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:47.880
 with your mouth, getting good at nasal breathing is useful.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:50.240
 A gear system of the type that Brian McKenzie

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:51.320
 and colleagues have developed,

1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:52.920
 I think is a good way to conceptualize this.

1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:54.840
 If you're doing long duration work,

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:56.440
 try and do it all nasal breathing.

1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:58.040
 If you have deviated septum,

1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:01.380
 it's probably because you don't nasal breathe enough.

1:28:01.380 --> 1:28:05.980
 Mouth breathing is something that many people suffer from.

1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:07.720
 You're more prone to infections.

1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:09.520
 It's not as efficient, et cetera.

1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:10.880
 There is a place for mouth breathing.

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:15.880
 However, it's usually if you need to do a strong exhale,

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:19.540
 oftentimes you can discard more volume through the mouth

1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:21.960
 unless you're very trained at nasal breathing.

1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:23.820
 So if you're doing high intensity training,

1:28:23.820 --> 1:28:26.840
 a good way to conceptualize this is to exhale

1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.360
 on the max effort and then to inhale

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:32.860
 on the less intense part.

1:28:32.860 --> 1:28:36.360
 So that might be as you're generating the movement,

1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:39.440
 in the concentric part of the movement, you exhale, right?

1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:41.680
 Just like on a bat swing or something like that,

1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:44.800
 or fighters and martial artists do this differently

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:46.140
 depending on how they were trained

1:28:46.140 --> 1:28:48.280
 and the different purposes, but the kind of like,

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:51.400
 or the kind of exhaling during the effort

1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:54.800
 and then inhaling on the portion of the repetition

1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:57.360
 that is not the highest effort portion.

1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:59.600
 Usually that's the eccentric phase

1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:01.800
 of anything involving weights or rowing

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:03.040
 and things of that sort.

1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:07.000
 So nasal breathing is great,

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.460
 but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work,

1:29:09.460 --> 1:29:10.760
 you will need to incorporate the mouth.

1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:12.200
 So a gear system would look something like,

1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:14.200
 first gear would be just nasal breathing

1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:16.360
 or second gear would also be just nasal breathing,

1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:17.360
 but with more effort.

1:29:17.360 --> 1:29:19.520
 Third gear, again, power speed endurance

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:20.440
 has a lot more about this.

1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:21.840
 You can go to their website.

1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:24.740
 I think it's a very intelligent way to conceptualize this.

1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.160
 As you go into more max effort,

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:30.480
 then you're going into third and fourth and fifth gear

1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:32.760
 and at some point you're not thinking about nose or mouth.

1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:34.400
 You're just trying to hang on for dear life

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:36.200
 and complete the work safely.

1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:40.480
 And that means breathe through whatever orifice

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:41.680
 works for you.

1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:45.200
 So that's one aspect, nose versus mouth.

1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:48.680
 The other aspect is whether or not you're using your ribs,

1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:50.620
 the intercostal muscles are these muscles

1:29:50.620 --> 1:29:53.220
 that the Bruce Lee had these remarkable

1:29:53.220 --> 1:29:57.700
 intercostal muscles that allow you to lift the rib cage

1:29:57.700 --> 1:29:59.640
 or the diaphragm, which is a skeletal muscle

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:00.760
 that sits below the lungs.

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:03.160
 Just to remind you, when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:06.880
 when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:11.320
 Here's something that most people don't do

1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:12.880
 and would benefit tremendously from.

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.800
 And I can say this because Andy Galpin's lab

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:18.640
 has done work on this, exploring how warming up

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:21.640
 the intercostals and the nerve to diaphragm pathways

1:30:21.640 --> 1:30:24.100
 before any kind of endurance work,

1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:26.400
 or in the first few minutes of endurance work

1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:28.840
 can allow you to breathe more deeply

1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:33.080
 and to deliver more oxygen to the blood and, excuse me,

1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:36.760
 and to the muscles and to be able to do more work

1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:37.880
 more efficiently.

1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:40.320
 So what that involves is sometimes sitting,

1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:42.400
 sometimes standing and just really concentrating

1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:43.560
 on two things.

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:46.120
 We always hear about how we should diaphragmatic breathe

1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:48.960
 and that means our belly moves out when we inhale.

1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:53.960
 So our stomach expands, but also expanding the intercostals,

1:30:54.200 --> 1:30:56.660
 which means actually raising the ribs, chest breathing.

1:30:56.660 --> 1:30:58.320
 We're all told that in yoga class,

1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:00.600
 don't breathe with your chest this,

1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:04.480
 but actually that is warming up the intercostal muscles.

1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:07.200
 So this is also a great way to generate adrenaline

1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:09.400
 if you do it a little bit intensely.

1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:12.260
 So let's say you're feeling unmotivated to train.

1:31:12.260 --> 1:31:14.800
 I don't particularly like doing endurance training

1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:16.200
 until I'm actually doing it.

1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:20.440
 So I use and benefit from having a practice

1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:22.200
 where I'll just sit there and for about three minutes,

1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:23.280
 I'll just breathe very deeply,

1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:25.700
 trying to raise my chest as much as I can

1:31:25.700 --> 1:31:28.780
 for maybe a minute and then expanding,

1:31:28.780 --> 1:31:31.380
 contracting my diaphragm and expanding my stomach outward

1:31:31.380 --> 1:31:32.360
 when I inhale.

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:33.200
 By the end of that,

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:36.000
 you're actually delivering more oxygen to your system.

1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:39.640
 My lab has looked at this in a totally different context.

1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:41.360
 Andy's lab has looked at it in the context

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:43.700
 of physical performance.

1:31:43.700 --> 1:31:47.280
 So warming up the breathing muscles should make sense

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:50.240
 given that you now know that muscles and neurons

1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:53.840
 need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function.

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:54.880
 And so that's a great warmup.

1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:56.720
 You can also do this while walking

1:31:56.720 --> 1:31:59.080
 or while getting on the bike and starting to pedal,

1:31:59.080 --> 1:32:00.580
 really starting to think about

1:32:00.580 --> 1:32:03.040
 warming up the breathing system.

1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:05.080
 And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:08.820
 or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on.

1:32:08.820 --> 1:32:10.380
 So that's something that we don't often hear about.

1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:12.720
 The other one, the other tool rather

1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:14.520
 that I've talked about in a previous episode,

1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:15.360
 I'll just mention again,

1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:17.620
 is some people when they do endurance type work,

1:32:17.620 --> 1:32:19.320
 they get a stitch in their side.

1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:21.520
 They feel like they've got a side cramp.

1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:26.520
 Very rarely is it actually a skeletal muscular cramp.

1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:30.340
 It's oftentimes, it's a referenced pain

1:32:30.340 --> 1:32:32.860
 of the phrenic nerve that innervates the liver.

1:32:32.860 --> 1:32:34.260
 So the phrenic nerve is responsible

1:32:34.260 --> 1:32:36.260
 for the movement of the diaphragm.

1:32:37.320 --> 1:32:39.040
 It is a very important system,

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:41.320
 but it has a number of what we call collateral.

1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:44.840
 So it branches to other organs, runs over other organs.

1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:46.800
 Sometimes when we're breathing shallow

1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:48.580
 and we are in physical motion

1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:50.360
 and we're engaging in physical effort,

1:32:50.360 --> 1:32:52.000
 we'll feel that side stitch and we think,

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.100
 oh, I've got a cramp, or maybe I'm dehydrated,

1:32:54.100 --> 1:32:57.000
 or maybe I need to run with my hands over my head.

1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:57.960
 Excuse me.

1:32:57.960 --> 1:33:00.480
 Typically you can relieve that side cramp,

1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:01.700
 which isn't a cramp at all,

1:33:01.700 --> 1:33:04.620
 that side stitch by doing the double inhale, exhale,

1:33:04.620 --> 1:33:06.720
 really breathing deeply,

1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:09.840
 and then sneaking a little bit more air in.

1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:12.360
 That's a double kind of firing,

1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:14.520
 or what we call volley of action potentials

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:18.080
 sent from the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm,

1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:20.600
 which will also activate that collateral,

1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:23.960
 that branch literally of the nerve that innervates the liver.

1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:26.320
 And then when you exhale,

1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:28.180
 you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide.

1:33:28.180 --> 1:33:31.760
 But if you repeat that a few times, often,

1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:33.040
 in fact for me every time,

1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:35.120
 but often what'll happen is that side stitch

1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:36.320
 will just naturally disappear.

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:38.320
 It just means you're not breathing properly.

1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:40.800
 The phrenic nerve is firing in a way

1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:43.440
 that's kind of aggravating that referenced pain.

1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:46.080
 There's nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about this.

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.100
 It just has to do with the way

1:33:47.100 --> 1:33:50.220
 that the different nerves travel in the body.

1:33:50.220 --> 1:33:52.040
 So as you set out on your run,

1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:54.840
 or maybe you're going to do some muscular endurance work

1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:58.580
 or high-intensity work, warming up the intercostals,

1:33:58.580 --> 1:34:01.120
 warming up the diaphragm is good.

1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:03.280
 And there are exercises,

1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:04.340
 there is work that you can do

1:34:04.340 --> 1:34:06.340
 to strengthen the intercostals

1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:08.440
 and to strengthen the diaphragm

1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:10.200
 during bouts of this kind of effort.

1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:12.040
 And I would say that one of the ways

1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:15.160
 that you can do that best is by really focusing

1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:19.160
 on getting the maximum diaphragmatic expansion

1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:21.940
 and chest lifting, what we're all told now not to do.

1:34:21.940 --> 1:34:23.800
 Don't chest breathe, belly breathe.

1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:25.600
 The intercostals are there for a reason,

1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:27.640
 and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs.

1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:30.200
 They work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm.

1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.760
 But when you are starting to fatigue,

1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:35.060
 to start to really inhale deeply

1:34:35.060 --> 1:34:36.320
 and try and really expand those

1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:39.280
 to deliver more oxygen to your system.

1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:41.200
 While we're talking about delivering more oxygen

1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:44.040
 to your system, I want to share with you a useful tool

1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:46.140
 that will now make total sense mechanistically

1:34:46.140 --> 1:34:51.040
 why it works, which is oftentimes when we are on a long run

1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:53.400
 or in long duration bouts of effort,

1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:57.040
 we will hit the so-called wall, right?

1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:58.800
 We will bonk, I think they used to call it,

1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:00.760
 or maybe do they still call it that, Costello?

1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:02.360
 He's asleep.

1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:05.820
 We bonk, we just rethink, no, we can't continue.

1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:08.700
 It's a curious thing as to whether or not that's neural

1:35:08.700 --> 1:35:10.720
 or whether or not it's fuel-based.

1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:12.900
 There's certainly going to be a psychological

1:35:12.900 --> 1:35:14.440
 or motivational component,

1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.800
 but one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear,

1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:20.160
 the capacity to push on is by understanding the way

1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.420
 that different muscle fibers use energy differently.

1:35:24.420 --> 1:35:27.120
 Remember the fast twitch phosphocreatine system

1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:28.880
 and the slow twitch system that relies mainly

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.420
 on lipids and glucose.

1:35:30.420 --> 1:35:32.360
 Okay, well, even if you don't remember all that,

1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:34.280
 if you've been running steadily for a long time

1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:35.400
 and you're starting to fatigue

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:37.240
 and you feel like it's time to quit,

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:41.700
 you may have not tapped into an alternative fuel source.

1:35:41.700 --> 1:35:42.800
 One thing that you can do

1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:45.160
 is you can actually increase your speed.

1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:48.840
 This is also true of work where you're doing repetitions

1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:49.880
 with kettlebells or something.

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:51.660
 You can start to increase your speed.

1:35:51.660 --> 1:35:55.760
 So run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster,

1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:58.320
 not all out sprint, but in doing that,

1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:01.220
 you're shifting the muscles and the nerves

1:36:01.220 --> 1:36:03.760
 over towards utilizing a separate fuel source

1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:05.700
 or a distinct fuel source.

1:36:05.700 --> 1:36:07.160
 Maybe the phosphocreatine system,

1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:10.400
 if it's a quick bout of intense acceleration,

1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:14.000
 or maybe it's a combination of lipids and carbohydrates

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.060
 in your system that weren't available to you prior.

1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:18.480
 Now, of course, if you completely deplete

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:21.360
 your liver glycogen, you completely deplete everything,

1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:24.160
 you're only going to be running on stored fuel and fats

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:27.240
 and eventually you'll start metabolizing protein

1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:28.780
 or muscles themselves.

1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:33.560
 But this is a kind of a unique way to realize that,

1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:36.540
 oh, you weren't out of energy at all,

1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:39.000
 you were just over relying on one fuel source.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.680
 And this is the reason why, especially elite athletes

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:44.000
 are starting to both rely on carbohydrates,

1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:45.680
 so they're doing the whole carb depletion

1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:46.760
 then carb loading thing,

1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:48.320
 they're loading up their liver and their muscles

1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:51.280
 with plenty of glycogen by eating pastas and rice

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.160
 and stuff before races,

1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:56.880
 but they are also ingesting ketones during races,

1:36:56.880 --> 1:36:58.440
 during long bouts of effort,

1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:00.660
 because ketones can be a quick form of energy,

1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:02.600
 there's no reason why you can't use ketones

1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:05.040
 if they are taken exogenous ketones

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:06.960
 and carbohydrate and in combination.

1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:08.680
 Remember the body is accustomed

1:37:08.680 --> 1:37:12.320
 to using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids, carbohydrates,

1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:15.740
 all these things, it's only in the kind of internet age

1:37:15.740 --> 1:37:18.720
 that we think in terms of, oh, well, you're either keto

1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:22.920
 or you're burning sugar or you're fat adapted

1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:27.120
 or fat fasting or fast fasting or fat fadding,

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:28.760
 Costello woke up when I said fat fadding,

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:30.280
 I'm not talking about you Costello.

1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:32.400
 So the point is that your body is used

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:33.760
 to using multiple fuel sources,

1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:35.660
 so if you're kind of hitting that wall,

1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:38.200
 sometimes accelerating can actually allow you

1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:39.760
 to tap into a new fuel source

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:41.040
 or combination of fuel sources

1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:43.740
 just based on the way that muscles use fuel,

1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:45.480
 so that's another tool.

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:47.160
 The other thing that's really important to think about

1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:50.500
 in terms of endurance type work is hydration,

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:53.100
 and I think hydration is important for all forms

1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:56.160
 of physical work and exercise, not just endurance.

1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:00.520
 The deal with hydration is that we've been taught

1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:01.960
 about hydration all wrong,

1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:05.020
 but let's remember what neurons work on,

1:38:05.020 --> 1:38:06.880
 what do they use in order to fire?

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:10.640
 Well, they certainly need water, right?

1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:12.880
 We need water in our system, I should say,

1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:15.700
 but remember they use electrolytes, sodium and potassium

1:38:15.700 --> 1:38:17.040
 to generate those action potentials

1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:18.840
 to actually get neurons to contract,

1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:20.760
 to be able, excuse me, muscles to contract

1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:23.680
 and for our brain to function and to be able to think.

1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:28.140
 Typically, typically we're going to lose anywhere

1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:32.180
 from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise,

1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:33.640
 and that's going to vary tremendously,

1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:35.480
 it's going to vary on weather,

1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.360
 it's going to vary on intensity,

1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:40.360
 probably more like five pounds if it's hot day

1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:43.060
 and you're exercising very intensely,

1:38:43.060 --> 1:38:46.200
 so about one to five pounds per hour.

1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:48.640
 Now, you know how much you weigh,

1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:52.580
 so if you think about your weight in pounds,

1:38:52.580 --> 1:38:57.580
 once you lose about one to 4% of your body weight in water,

1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:01.840
 you're going to experience about a 20 to 30% reduction

1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:06.380
 in work capacity, in your ability to generate effort

1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.820
 of any kind, strength, endurance, et cetera.

1:39:09.820 --> 1:39:12.420
 You are also going to experience a significant drop

1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:15.540
 in your ability to think and perform mental operations,

1:39:15.540 --> 1:39:17.100
 so hydration is key.

1:39:17.100 --> 1:39:19.040
 Now, many people have been told, well,

1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:21.760
 if you urinate and your urine is clear,

1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:23.480
 well, then you're hydrated enough.

1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:26.280
 Sometimes that's true, sometimes that's not true.

1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:29.660
 Also, and this is a topic I enjoy discussing,

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:33.000
 but urine is a biological phenomenon,

1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.440
 it's actually filtered blood.

1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:37.380
 Every once in a while, if there's a kid

1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:38.680
 and it's a family friend, I'll say,

1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:41.260
 did you know that your pee is actually filtered blood?

1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:42.680
 And they usually kind of go wide-eyed,

1:39:42.680 --> 1:39:44.000
 but then they go, oh, that's kind of cool,

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:45.680
 like kids have this natural curiosity

1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:47.560
 about blood and pee and stuff

1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.480
 that's not contaminated by our preconceived notions

1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:53.520
 of those things being gross.

1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:56.360
 Because urine being filtered blood

1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:57.640
 can give you some indication

1:39:57.640 --> 1:40:01.000
 as to whether or not you're hydrated enough or not.

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.520
 And in order to really assess that,

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:05.200
 it's not going to be sufficient

1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:07.920
 to urinate into another volume of water

1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:09.200
 and assess whether or not your urine

1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:10.240
 is very dark or very light.

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:12.480
 It actually requires urinating into a small volume

1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:15.000
 and saying, well, is it darker or lighter than before?

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.080
 It's not something you really want to do most places.

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:22.240
 The etiquette of most gyms and environments

1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:23.760
 is not suitable for that.

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.640
 But one of the things that you can just do

1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:27.640
 is you can figure, well,

1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:30.820
 I'm going to lose one to five pounds of water per hour.

1:40:30.820 --> 1:40:35.720
 You can show up to exercise reasonably hydrated

1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:36.880
 with electrolytes.

1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:39.280
 So potassium, sodium, and magnesium are really key.

1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:40.120
 Yes, it's true.

1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:42.880
 You can die from drinking too much water in particular

1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:45.680
 because it forces you, if you drink too much water,

1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:47.360
 you'll excrete too many electrolytes

1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:49.040
 and your brain will shut off.

1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:51.500
 You'll actually, your heart will stop functioning properly.

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:53.140
 So you don't want to over consume water

1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:54.760
 to the extreme either.

1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:57.240
 But there are a number of equations

1:40:57.240 --> 1:40:59.560
 that go into figuring out how much water you need

1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:01.500
 based on how intense your training,

1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:02.960
 et cetera, body size, et cetera.

1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:05.520
 Just remember, you burn, you lose, excuse me,

1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:08.540
 about one to five pounds of water per hour,

1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:11.280
 depending on how hot it is and how intensely you're exercising

1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:14.440
 once your body weight drops by one to 4%.

1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:15.600
 So you can just figure it,

1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.780
 well, if you lose five pounds per hour,

1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:20.080
 you exercise for two hours,

1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:23.520
 let's say you're about 200 pounds, that's about 10%, okay?

1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:26.880
 Well, you want to replace that very quickly

1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:29.100
 or you want to replace that all along

1:41:29.100 --> 1:41:32.040
 before you start experiencing this massive 20 or 30%

1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:34.680
 reduction in work capacity of muscles and the brain.

1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:38.120
 A simple formula, what I call the Galpin equation,

1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:41.220
 hereafter referred to as the Galpin equation,

1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:44.560
 is a formula that gets you close to the exact amount

1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:47.460
 that you would want that Dr. Andy Galpin came up with,

1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:50.080
 which is your body weight in pounds

1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:52.200
 divided by the number 30.

1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:54.160
 And that is how many ounces you should drink

1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:57.280
 for every 15 minutes of exercise.

1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:59.580
 So once again, the Galpin equation,

1:41:59.580 --> 1:42:03.440
 your body weight in pounds divided by 30,

1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:08.440
 that's the amount of fluid to drink in ounces, right?

1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:12.380
 Every 15 minutes of exercise.

1:42:12.380 --> 1:42:15.580
 Now, if you are sweating a lot, you may need more, okay?

1:42:15.580 --> 1:42:19.080
 If you're already very well hydrated, you may need less,

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:22.300
 but that's a good rule of thumb to begin

1:42:22.300 --> 1:42:24.760
 and to start to understand the relationship

1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:27.460
 between hydration and performance.

1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:32.220
 There is a phenomenon in which gastric emptying,

1:42:32.220 --> 1:42:34.420
 the ability to move stuff out of your gut,

1:42:34.420 --> 1:42:37.400
 including water and electrolytes out of your gut

1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:39.860
 and into the bloodstream and for delivery

1:42:39.860 --> 1:42:41.900
 to the tissues of your body for effort,

1:42:41.900 --> 1:42:45.500
 is hindered when you get above 70% of your VO2 max.

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:48.440
 In other words, when you're doing high intensity training,

1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:51.240
 sometimes people experience that ingesting water

1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:54.900
 during intense training is difficult.

1:42:54.900 --> 1:42:57.900
 It is something that can be actually trained up.

1:42:57.900 --> 1:43:00.800
 It's a matter of learning to kind of relax

1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:02.700
 your abdominal muscles.

1:43:02.700 --> 1:43:05.640
 And there are some other aspects of adaptation

1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:09.340
 that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work.

1:43:09.340 --> 1:43:14.340
 As Galpin says, don't try and ingest fluids

1:43:14.420 --> 1:43:17.300
 when you're working out or competing at higher

1:43:17.300 --> 1:43:19.820
 than 70% of VO2 max, if you've never done it before,

1:43:19.820 --> 1:43:21.900
 you want to train up this capacity.

1:43:21.900 --> 1:43:24.340
 People can learn how to consume fluids during a race

1:43:24.340 --> 1:43:27.020
 or consume fluids during bouts of exercise

1:43:27.020 --> 1:43:28.760
 that are very intense.

1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:30.380
 And a lot of people don't want to do that

1:43:30.380 --> 1:43:32.700
 because they don't want to have to stop to urinate, et cetera.

1:43:32.700 --> 1:43:35.460
 But given the crucial role of hydration

1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:38.600
 for muscular performance and for brain performance,

1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:40.400
 it seems that if you're going to be doing

1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:42.740
 a lot of high intensity interval training

1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:45.140
 of the various kinds I talked about today,

1:43:45.140 --> 1:43:46.900
 or high intensity training of any kind,

1:43:46.900 --> 1:43:49.000
 that hydration is key and learning,

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.140
 or in other words, getting your system to adapt

1:43:51.140 --> 1:43:53.580
 to ingesting fluids in the middle of these workouts

1:43:53.580 --> 1:43:56.500
 is something that seems beneficial, at least to me,

1:43:56.500 --> 1:44:00.060
 in terms of the trade-off between being dehydrated

1:44:00.060 --> 1:44:02.420
 and the somewhat discomfort of maybe drinking some fluids.

1:44:02.420 --> 1:44:04.640
 So you sip small amounts of fluid initially,

1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:06.580
 and then you're able to take bigger and bigger gulps

1:44:06.580 --> 1:44:10.180
 as time goes on, and pretty soon you're able to drink

1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:13.100
 mid-set or be, excuse me, not mid-set,

1:44:13.100 --> 1:44:15.080
 please don't do that, between sets in your workout

1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:17.380
 or while you're still breathing hard after a mile repeat

1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:19.980
 or something of that sort without much disruption

1:44:19.980 --> 1:44:22.020
 or any at all to your performance.

1:44:22.020 --> 1:44:25.220
 Last episode, we talked about how to assess recovery

1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:28.180
 and things that you might want to do to improve recovery,

1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:30.500
 how exposure to ice baths and cold showers

1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:33.520
 can reduce inflammation, which can be great for recovery.

1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:36.660
 But can inhibit some of the adaptations

1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:37.940
 for strength and hypertrophy

1:44:37.940 --> 1:44:40.500
 because inflammation isn't good or bad.

1:44:40.500 --> 1:44:43.900
 Inflammation isn't like a nice person or a mean person,

1:44:43.900 --> 1:44:44.840
 it's both.

1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:48.560
 It's a great thing for stimulating adaptations,

1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:50.300
 but you don't want it around too long.

1:44:50.300 --> 1:44:52.420
 And so we suggested that you not do ice baths

1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:55.620
 within probably six hours of any training

1:44:55.620 --> 1:44:58.740
 where the goal was hypertrophy or strength training.

1:44:58.740 --> 1:45:00.860
 There is some evidence that getting yourself

1:45:00.860 --> 1:45:04.900
 into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance training

1:45:04.900 --> 1:45:09.940
 can actually improve the mitochondrial aspects

1:45:09.940 --> 1:45:11.200
 of endurance exercise,

1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:14.740
 that you can get improvements in mitochondrial density

1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:18.720
 and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration

1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:20.020
 by doing that afterwards

1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:22.100
 and that it can facilitate recovery.

1:45:22.100 --> 1:45:24.780
 That's still a bit of a controversial area.

1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:26.360
 I do think that what I mentioned earlier,

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:27.720
 that waiting at least six hours

1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:30.580
 and probably more like 24 hours between workouts

1:45:30.580 --> 1:45:33.740
 is a good idea that getting at least one full day of rest

1:45:33.740 --> 1:45:35.580
 each week, for some people that'll be two.

1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:37.160
 I have to say, I'm one of these people

1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:40.060
 that after two days of absolutely no exercise,

1:45:40.060 --> 1:45:42.100
 I do perform better consistently

1:45:42.100 --> 1:45:44.260
 across all aspects of physical performance

1:45:44.260 --> 1:45:46.760
 and mentally, I feel better as well.

1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:49.100
 Even though I loathe to take those days off,

1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:51.160
 unless I'm really exhausted,

1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:53.180
 it does seem to help my training.

1:45:53.180 --> 1:45:55.200
 Some people can train seven days a week and they're fine.

1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:57.820
 I think it just is, there's a lot of individual variation.

1:45:57.820 --> 1:45:58.900
 You want to work on sleep

1:45:58.900 --> 1:46:00.940
 and maximizing sleep for recovery, nutrition,

1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:01.920
 of course, as well.

1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:06.340
 I talked about sleep in the first four episodes

1:46:06.340 --> 1:46:07.180
 of the podcast.

1:46:07.180 --> 1:46:08.740
 If you have trouble with sleep,

1:46:08.740 --> 1:46:11.100
 definitely check out those episodes.

1:46:11.100 --> 1:46:14.720
 It's very clear and a number of sports teams,

1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:18.800
 even some folks that I work with and Andy Galpin and others

1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:20.060
 are starting to incorporate

1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:22.580
 a what's called a parasympathetic down regulation

1:46:22.580 --> 1:46:25.500
 after training of any kind as a way to accelerate recovery

1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:27.420
 and enable you to do more work.

1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:29.500
 In other words, get back to work out sooner.

1:46:29.500 --> 1:46:31.300
 What is parasympathetic down regulation?

1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:33.620
 It means finishing your training

1:46:33.620 --> 1:46:35.840
 and instead of just hopping on the phone

1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:36.900
 or hopping into your car

1:46:36.900 --> 1:46:40.620
 and heading off to take five minutes minimum,

1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:42.740
 maybe ideally more like 10 or 20,

1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:45.180
 but for sake of time, five minutes minimum

1:46:45.180 --> 1:46:48.100
 and doing just some slow, pure nasal,

1:46:48.100 --> 1:46:50.260
 long exhale devoted breathing

1:46:50.260 --> 1:46:53.060
 or lying down and just kind of zoning out.

1:46:53.060 --> 1:46:55.820
 That it seems can accelerate recovery

1:46:55.820 --> 1:46:59.000
 and allow you to get back into other types of work,

1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:01.220
 mental work or physical work more quickly,

1:47:01.220 --> 1:47:02.500
 which makes total sense

1:47:02.500 --> 1:47:05.380
 because remember your nervous system

1:47:05.380 --> 1:47:08.540
 and recovery and work is a local phenomenon.

1:47:08.540 --> 1:47:10.100
 Which muscles were you using?

1:47:10.100 --> 1:47:13.080
 Were you using your glutes, your hams and your back

1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:14.680
 or were you using your shoulders, et cetera?

1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:16.480
 But it's also a systemic thing.

1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:18.660
 It's also about those neurons in the locus coeruleus

1:47:18.660 --> 1:47:19.700
 that are releasing epinephrine.

1:47:19.700 --> 1:47:22.200
 You want to quiet all that down after training.

1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:23.960
 You want to really just zone out.

1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:26.660
 Think Costello, channel your inner Costello

1:47:26.660 --> 1:47:29.740
 and just mellow out for five to 20 minutes

1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:31.860
 and then move into the rest of your day.

1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:33.620
 Five minutes should be manageable

1:47:33.620 --> 1:47:35.520
 even if it's just sitting in the car with your eyes closed

1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:37.540
 doing that down regulation breathing.

1:47:37.540 --> 1:47:39.340
 I think you'll see big benefits

1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:42.540
 in terms of allowing yourself to come back sooner,

1:47:42.540 --> 1:47:45.040
 do more work over time

1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:47.300
 and just perform and feel better generally

1:47:47.300 --> 1:47:49.100
 as well as be able to think about other things

1:47:49.100 --> 1:47:51.620
 besides just how much the previous workout

1:47:51.620 --> 1:47:54.020
 kind of beat you up.

1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:55.980
 A couple more things I think are going to be useful

1:47:55.980 --> 1:47:57.780
 and I do want to just pack these in

1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:01.140
 because we are closing out the month on physical performance

1:48:01.140 --> 1:48:04.940
 and that's about programming and about pacing

1:48:04.940 --> 1:48:08.280
 and the kind of mental aspects of endurance.

1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:12.660
 So let's start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance.

1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:17.300
 I learned from a friend and colleague here at the podcast

1:48:17.300 --> 1:48:20.140
 that who's very active in triathlon and marathon

1:48:20.140 --> 1:48:22.260
 and another knows a lot about that whole world

1:48:22.260 --> 1:48:24.100
 and the competitive landscape there

1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:28.140
 that pacing and literally physical pacers

1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:31.100
 of a laser on the ground or visualizing

1:48:31.100 --> 1:48:34.340
 or having a pace car or a pace runner in front

1:48:34.340 --> 1:48:37.100
 is actually not allowed in many competitions.

1:48:37.100 --> 1:48:41.100
 And if those are present doesn't allow the race times

1:48:41.100 --> 1:48:45.640
 to qualify as legitimate record holding times.

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:47.380
 And that's very interesting to me

1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:51.740
 because what we know is that the visual system

1:48:51.740 --> 1:48:54.580
 has this capacity to switch back and forth

1:48:54.580 --> 1:48:56.180
 between what we call panoramic vision

1:48:56.180 --> 1:48:57.940
 where we're not really focused on anything.

1:48:57.940 --> 1:48:59.760
 Things are just flowing past us

1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:02.280
 or our eyes are just kind of zoned out.

1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:04.620
 So I can do this right now and you won't be able to tell

1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:06.180
 but I'm looking at the corners of the room.

1:49:06.180 --> 1:49:07.820
 I see Costello down there on the floor.

1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:12.580
 I see my podcast team here and I can also see the microphone.

1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:14.780
 I can see myself in this environment.

1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:16.120
 That's panoramic vision.

1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:18.260
 Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location

1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:20.020
 like right there in the center of the camera

1:49:20.020 --> 1:49:21.580
 it's what's called a vergence eye movement.

1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:23.820
 So I'm contracting my visual window.

1:49:23.820 --> 1:49:27.140
 The contraction of the visual window when that's done

1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:28.340
 is the same thing that would happen

1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:31.300
 if I was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner

1:49:31.300 --> 1:49:33.280
 or a laser on the ground.

1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:35.300
 The mirror bringing our eyes together

1:49:35.300 --> 1:49:37.580
 to what we call a vergence point

1:49:37.580 --> 1:49:40.780
 has the impact of triggering the activation

1:49:40.780 --> 1:49:43.060
 of neural circuits in the thalamus.

1:49:43.060 --> 1:49:44.500
 Things like Zona and Serta

1:49:44.500 --> 1:49:46.080
 if you really want to know what their names are

1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:48.220
 of these brain areas as well as in the brainstem

1:49:48.220 --> 1:49:51.040
 that activate the so-called alertness system.

1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:52.420
 Things like locus coeruleus.

1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:55.400
 Whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us

1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:56.940
 into states of relaxation.

1:49:56.940 --> 1:49:59.720
 You can actually leverage this during your runs.

1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:02.060
 Let's say you're out for a long run

1:50:02.060 --> 1:50:03.980
 or you're swimming or you're cycling.

1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:06.460
 This is probably easiest to imagine out of the water

1:50:06.460 --> 1:50:08.420
 but you could probably do in the water as well.

1:50:08.420 --> 1:50:10.600
 If you focus your attention on a landmark

1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:12.320
 that you're going to run to,

1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:14.720
 you'll find that it's much easier than if you don't

1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:17.860
 actually have a set milestone or landmark

1:50:17.860 --> 1:50:19.280
 that you're going to run to.

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:21.580
 However, if you were to continue that repeatedly

1:50:21.580 --> 1:50:24.220
 just going milestone after milestone after milestone

1:50:24.220 --> 1:50:26.500
 you would feel more mentally fatigued

1:50:26.500 --> 1:50:27.660
 and you would actually be able

1:50:27.660 --> 1:50:30.540
 to degenerate less work overall.

1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:35.140
 One thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone,

1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:37.160
 running to that milestone or biking,

1:50:37.160 --> 1:50:38.660
 whatever it is the activity happens to be

1:50:38.660 --> 1:50:40.660
 and then dilating your field of view

1:50:40.660 --> 1:50:43.600
 to relax the system and then continuing again.

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.140
 So it's this kind of active contraction

1:50:46.140 --> 1:50:47.780
 or of the visual window

1:50:47.780 --> 1:50:49.660
 and then dilation of the visual window.

1:50:49.660 --> 1:50:50.820
 Contraction of the visual window

1:50:50.820 --> 1:50:52.240
 allows you to generate more effort

1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:53.520
 but there's a cost to doing that

1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:54.980
 because neurons consume energy

1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:56.740
 and now you know how they do that.

1:50:56.740 --> 1:50:58.420
 Whereas dilation allows you

1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:01.680
 to essentially be more efficient, right?

1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:06.340
 Now pacing is not allowed or having a pacer, a visual pacer

1:51:06.340 --> 1:51:08.700
 because it does allow you to access systems

1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:10.780
 in the brain and body that allow you

1:51:10.780 --> 1:51:13.740
 to create more energy, more effort.

1:51:13.740 --> 1:51:14.900
 And so I find it interesting

1:51:14.900 --> 1:51:17.220
 that I think in a kind of subconscious genius

1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:19.980
 the race officials and the governing bodies

1:51:19.980 --> 1:51:22.420
 of these races have said, okay, sure,

1:51:22.420 --> 1:51:24.340
 having a pacer there or someone in front

1:51:24.340 --> 1:51:25.360
 you can draft off of them.

1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:28.460
 There's actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect

1:51:28.460 --> 1:51:30.660
 of having someone in front of you that makes it easier

1:51:30.660 --> 1:51:34.380
 to run in the wake of their air stream, so to speak.

1:51:34.380 --> 1:51:36.260
 Same is true in cycling.

1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:37.900
 This is why the cycling teams are so good

1:51:37.900 --> 1:51:40.220
 at maneuvering in packs in very specific ways.

1:51:40.220 --> 1:51:42.280
 You can go faster with less effort

1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:45.180
 if you're drafting as it's called behind somebody.

1:51:45.180 --> 1:51:48.120
 But as well, where you place your vision

1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:50.260
 will allow you to generate more effort.

1:51:50.260 --> 1:51:52.060
 And so it's interesting that they've taken out

1:51:52.060 --> 1:51:57.060
 this kind of, if you will, performance enhancing tool.

1:51:57.380 --> 1:51:59.700
 I imagine, and I have to imagine

1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:00.980
 it's the appropriate word here,

1:52:00.980 --> 1:52:05.980
 that good runners, good cyclists have the ability

1:52:05.980 --> 1:52:10.380
 to create a kind of pacer in their mind's eye.

1:52:10.380 --> 1:52:12.280
 I have to imagine that they're not just completely

1:52:12.280 --> 1:52:13.780
 allowing their attention to drift,

1:52:13.780 --> 1:52:15.260
 although they do that when they want to be

1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:17.540
 in highly efficient mode generating effort

1:52:17.540 --> 1:52:19.740
 without having to tax their mental capacity.

1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:22.700
 And remember mental capacity is neural energy

1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:25.460
 and consumes glucose, energy that they could devote

1:52:25.460 --> 1:52:26.960
 to the functioning of their body,

1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:30.600
 but that when needed that they can focus their energy in

1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:34.260
 and actually kind of chase a mental pacer or pick milestones.

1:52:34.260 --> 1:52:37.380
 So this is a mental game that you can play as well.

1:52:37.380 --> 1:52:39.100
 It's a little bit hard to do in the context

1:52:39.100 --> 1:52:40.220
 of weightlifting in the gym.

1:52:40.220 --> 1:52:42.660
 It's more of a moving through space kind of thing.

1:52:42.660 --> 1:52:45.980
 But some people do this by counting reps, et cetera.

1:52:45.980 --> 1:52:48.300
 I think it's especially suitable

1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:52.140
 for endurance type of exercise, especially done outside.

1:52:52.140 --> 1:52:53.980
 One of the reasons I hate running on a treadmill

1:52:53.980 --> 1:52:55.960
 is it just feels like it's never ending.

1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:58.060
 And I've never tried one of these Peloton things.

1:52:58.060 --> 1:52:59.720
 I try and avoid looking at screens as much

1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:01.180
 as I possibly can.

1:53:01.180 --> 1:53:03.780
 But if you try this next time you're out for a run or swim,

1:53:03.780 --> 1:53:05.680
 what you'll find is that you have a capacity

1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:09.700
 to engage a system of higher energy output

1:53:09.700 --> 1:53:11.640
 when you focus your eyes on a particular location,

1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:13.260
 but you want to use that judiciously

1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:15.940
 because your goal of course is to become efficient

1:53:15.940 --> 1:53:17.620
 at moving through space over time

1:53:17.620 --> 1:53:19.860
 and not taxing your brain and body to the point

1:53:19.860 --> 1:53:22.500
 where you arrive at the end of that,

1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:25.620
 unless it's race day, just completely tapped out.

1:53:25.620 --> 1:53:29.400
 So that's a kind of interesting aspect of running.

1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:31.980
 If you're a fan of running, which I am,

1:53:31.980 --> 1:53:34.700
 and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries

1:53:34.700 --> 1:53:37.640
 or docudramas made about, excuse me,

1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:39.260
 about Steve Prefontaine,

1:53:39.260 --> 1:53:42.100
 it was clear that he was mostly in a battle with himself,

1:53:42.100 --> 1:53:44.380
 but that he was also a highly competitive individual.

1:53:44.380 --> 1:53:46.240
 And you'll see this in some of his races.

1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:48.580
 I do encourage you to look some of those up on YouTube

1:53:48.580 --> 1:53:49.620
 or see the docudramas.

1:53:49.620 --> 1:53:50.700
 They're quite good.

1:53:50.700 --> 1:53:55.440
 Where he ran the, essentially it was 12 laps on a track.

1:53:55.440 --> 1:53:57.820
 It's essentially the five, it is the 5,000 meter race,

1:53:57.820 --> 1:53:59.660
 which is essentially three miles.

1:53:59.660 --> 1:54:01.900
 And he essentially tried to sprint the whole thing,

1:54:01.900 --> 1:54:02.740
 which is ridiculous.

1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.020
 Actually knowing what you know today,

1:54:04.020 --> 1:54:07.320
 you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine basically was pulling

1:54:07.320 --> 1:54:10.660
 from strength, speed, power, muscular endurance,

1:54:10.660 --> 1:54:13.540
 long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic,

1:54:13.540 --> 1:54:16.040
 as he sort of tried to maximize every fuel system.

1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:18.660
 And you'll see that in the races that he runs,

1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:22.700
 but that when runners are nearing the final laps,

1:54:22.700 --> 1:54:24.260
 the so-called bell lap of a race,

1:54:24.260 --> 1:54:27.060
 they'll often look to one another to see where somebody is,

1:54:27.060 --> 1:54:30.420
 obviously to assess their progress and how close somebody is.

1:54:30.420 --> 1:54:32.860
 But when somebody gets past,

1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:37.260
 oftentimes you'll see someone access this mysterious kick,

1:54:37.260 --> 1:54:40.240
 this ability to tap into some additional gear

1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:43.060
 that allows them to run forward or faster

1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:45.140
 when they themselves actually thought

1:54:45.140 --> 1:54:46.660
 that they were maxed out.

1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:48.800
 So someone could be running for the finish line.

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:49.940
 They're convinced they're going to win.

1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:51.140
 They're going max effort,

1:54:51.140 --> 1:54:52.460
 or at least they perceive max effort.

1:54:52.460 --> 1:54:54.580
 Someone passes them and all of a sudden,

1:54:54.580 --> 1:54:56.220
 max effort has changed.

1:54:56.220 --> 1:54:57.940
 Because of that visual target,

1:54:57.940 --> 1:55:01.800
 they are able to access higher levels of speed and output

1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:03.020
 and effort and performance.

1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:05.220
 They don't always catch up to that person and win,

1:55:05.220 --> 1:55:07.980
 but having a target, a milestone,

1:55:07.980 --> 1:55:11.460
 is a powerful way that we can generate more force

1:55:11.460 --> 1:55:12.980
 and energy in anything.

1:55:12.980 --> 1:55:15.160
 And the visual system is the way

1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:18.500
 that we bring those milestones into our brain,

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:20.500
 which then brings about epinephrine,

1:55:20.500 --> 1:55:22.300
 which brings about neural firing,

1:55:22.300 --> 1:55:24.700
 which allows us to access whatever resources

1:55:24.700 --> 1:55:26.500
 happen to be available to us.

1:55:26.500 --> 1:55:30.620
 So I find this fascinating because people often wonder,

1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:32.300
 like, where does the kick come from?

1:55:32.300 --> 1:55:35.340
 Where is this kind of gift of an additional gear?

1:55:35.340 --> 1:55:36.980
 Where is that deeper resource?

1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:39.300
 And we often express it and talk about it

1:55:39.300 --> 1:55:42.660
 in kind of psychological terms like heart or willpower,

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:45.520
 or that something kind of got transplanted into us

1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:46.700
 or descended into us,

1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:49.260
 and not to remove any of the spiritual aspects

1:55:49.260 --> 1:55:54.260
 of sport or running or effort or the human heart.

1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:57.220
 But it's very clear that the nervous system,

1:55:57.220 --> 1:55:59.540
 when it has a specific visual target,

1:55:59.540 --> 1:56:02.740
 can generate the sorts of intense effort

1:56:02.740 --> 1:56:04.140
 that it couldn't otherwise.

1:56:04.140 --> 1:56:05.780
 And it sometimes even comes as a surprise

1:56:05.780 --> 1:56:08.060
 to the person generating the effort.

1:56:08.060 --> 1:56:10.360
 I promised that I would talk about programming,

1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:14.260
 meaning when and how many times a week

1:56:14.260 --> 1:56:16.780
 to do the various workouts related to endurance

1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:19.420
 and how to merge those with other types of exercise

1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:21.620
 that you might be doing for strength or yoga

1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:23.360
 or other things that you might be doing,

1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.420
 like work and other things unrelated to exercise.

1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:30.580
 Since that's a vast space with many different parameters

1:56:30.580 --> 1:56:32.500
 and you all have different lives and lifestyles

1:56:32.500 --> 1:56:35.140
 and backgrounds with fitness, et cetera,

1:56:35.140 --> 1:56:37.180
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to put

1:56:37.180 --> 1:56:39.780
 three different levels, if you will,

1:56:39.780 --> 1:56:42.920
 or protocols that one could adopt

1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:47.800
 in a link on the show notes or in the caption on YouTube.

1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:48.900
 If you click on that link,

1:56:48.900 --> 1:56:52.580
 you'll be able to see three possible combinations

1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:55.020
 of endurance work, strength and hypertrophy work,

1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:58.200
 or endurance work, flexibility and hypertrophy work

1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:00.900
 that are grounded in many of the major publications

1:57:00.900 --> 1:57:03.460
 that Dr. Andy Galpin and colleagues and other people

1:57:03.460 --> 1:57:05.820
 have described, including this review

1:57:05.820 --> 1:57:08.440
 that's also linked there on concurrent training

1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:10.740
 and how one can use concurrent training,

1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:12.980
 meaning training for endurance, training for strength,

1:57:12.980 --> 1:57:14.180
 training for hypertrophy,

1:57:14.180 --> 1:57:15.460
 training for all these different things

1:57:15.460 --> 1:57:17.220
 without having to train constantly every day,

1:57:17.220 --> 1:57:18.920
 twice a day, et cetera.

1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:21.780
 So if you are interested in taking the protocols

1:57:21.780 --> 1:57:23.620
 that you learned about in this episode

1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:26.180
 and in previous episodes and combining those,

1:57:26.180 --> 1:57:27.740
 we've placed them there for you

1:57:27.740 --> 1:57:29.860
 as a completely zero cost resource.

1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:31.820
 Please understand they are not wholly,

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.580
 Costello agrees they are not wholly.

1:57:35.620 --> 1:57:38.460
 There will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate

1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:39.700
 and what they have time for,

1:57:39.700 --> 1:57:42.160
 but I think they'll serve as a useful guideline

1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:45.220
 in getting started or in continuing with

1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:49.100
 and expanding on existing endurance work, strength work,

1:57:49.100 --> 1:57:51.220
 hypertrophy work, and so forth.

1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:52.060
 Just really quickly,

1:57:52.060 --> 1:57:54.280
 we didn't talk about supplements much today.

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:55.340
 In the previous episodes,

1:57:55.340 --> 1:57:57.220
 I talked about the phosphocreatine system

1:57:57.220 --> 1:57:58.740
 and supplementing with creatine,

1:57:58.740 --> 1:57:59.980
 talked about beta alanine

1:57:59.980 --> 1:58:02.900
 for kind of moderate duration work.

1:58:02.900 --> 1:58:05.940
 Really the only things that have been shown

1:58:05.940 --> 1:58:08.780
 to really improve endurance work

1:58:08.780 --> 1:58:12.420
 across the four varieties of endurance work

1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:14.220
 I described today,

1:58:14.220 --> 1:58:16.520
 they have essentially two forms.

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:19.060
 One are stimulants, so things like caffeine

1:58:19.060 --> 1:58:20.680
 will definitely improve endurance work

1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:22.280
 and power output.

1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:24.940
 There's a little bit of evidence that caffeine intake

1:58:24.940 --> 1:58:27.680
 can actually inhibit the function of the creatine system,

1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:31.580
 but it's just one study, but that's interesting.

1:58:31.580 --> 1:58:32.540
 If you want to read that study,

1:58:32.540 --> 1:58:35.380
 you can put caffeine into examine.com

1:58:35.380 --> 1:58:37.380
 and it will take you to that study.

1:58:37.380 --> 1:58:39.380
 Many people get sore after workouts,

1:58:39.380 --> 1:58:41.220
 in particular workouts that involve

1:58:41.220 --> 1:58:42.540
 a lot of eccentric loading

1:58:43.520 --> 1:58:45.140
 or workouts that are very novel

1:58:45.140 --> 1:58:46.400
 where they've kind of pushed it

1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:49.420
 instead of moving gradually, as I suggest,

1:58:49.420 --> 1:58:52.020
 into say high-intensity anaerobic endurance work

1:58:52.020 --> 1:58:55.060
 of three sets of 20 seconds on, 100 second rest.

1:58:55.060 --> 1:58:58.060
 Maybe you get over-ambitious and you do eight sets,

1:58:58.060 --> 1:59:00.500
 in which case you are extremely sore.

1:59:00.500 --> 1:59:01.780
 Certain forms of magnesium,

1:59:01.780 --> 1:59:05.260
 in particular magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,

1:59:05.260 --> 1:59:09.240
 have been shown to be useful for removing

1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:12.820
 or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness.

1:59:12.820 --> 1:59:14.920
 That form of magnesium is distinctly different

1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:16.000
 than the sorts of magnesium

1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.540
 that are good for getting us into sleep,

1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:19.940
 things like magnesium threonate and by glycinate.

1:59:19.940 --> 1:59:24.060
 And then there's this whole thing about beet powder

1:59:24.060 --> 1:59:28.240
 and beet juices and things that increase nitric oxide

1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:30.140
 and allow for more vasodilation

1:59:30.140 --> 1:59:32.700
 and therefore delivery of blood to muscle and neurons

1:59:32.700 --> 1:59:34.940
 and other tissues for long bouts of endurance work.

1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:39.100
 Some people like beet juice and the related compounds

1:59:39.100 --> 1:59:41.220
 that increase arginine and vasodilation.

1:59:41.220 --> 1:59:42.580
 Some people don't.

1:59:42.580 --> 1:59:45.300
 Some people don't feel good when they take those.

1:59:45.300 --> 1:59:46.460
 Some people also don't feel good

1:59:46.460 --> 1:59:47.820
 when they take beta-alanine

1:59:47.820 --> 1:59:49.340
 because it can give them this feeling

1:59:49.340 --> 1:59:52.700
 of kind of like itchy, creepy crawlies under the skin,

1:59:52.700 --> 1:59:55.300
 kind of the niacin phenomenon, the niacin flush.

1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:56.460
 Some people don't mind that

1:59:56.460 --> 1:59:58.140
 or some people don't experience that.

1:59:58.140 --> 1:59:59.380
 So when it comes to supplementation,

1:59:59.380 --> 2:00:00.300
 there's a lot of variety,

2:00:00.300 --> 2:00:04.180
 but magnesium malate has been shown to reduce soreness.

2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:05.620
 So sometimes that's good.

2:00:05.620 --> 2:00:08.060
 Cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness,

2:00:08.060 --> 2:00:09.140
 things of that sort.

2:00:09.140 --> 2:00:14.140
 But in general, we focused mainly today on behavioral tools.

2:00:14.140 --> 2:00:17.880
 You'll notice that all of the tools are accessible

2:00:17.880 --> 2:00:20.340
 without the need for lots of equipment.

2:00:20.340 --> 2:00:22.420
 So I didn't say you need a rower or you need a kettlebell,

2:00:22.420 --> 2:00:23.860
 though those will work.

2:00:23.860 --> 2:00:26.300
 And I hope I was able to illustrate for you

2:00:26.300 --> 2:00:28.220
 that endurance isn't just one thing.

2:00:28.220 --> 2:00:32.780
 It's not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise

2:00:32.780 --> 2:00:34.980
 of different kinds, that there's also this mental component

2:00:34.980 --> 2:00:36.660
 because of the way that neurons work.

2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:39.700
 And also that there are these different forms of endurance,

2:00:39.700 --> 2:00:41.640
 of muscular endurance, where you're going to fail

2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:45.020
 because of the muscles and muscle energy utilization

2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:47.060
 and the nerves that innervate those muscles locally,

2:00:47.060 --> 2:00:50.640
 not because of a failure to bring in oxygen or blood.

2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:52.100
 Whereas long duration effort,

2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:55.780
 it's going to be more about being below your VO2 max

2:00:55.780 --> 2:00:58.020
 and your ability to be efficient for long bouts

2:00:58.020 --> 2:01:00.180
 of more than 12 minutes of exercise.

2:01:00.180 --> 2:01:04.600
 One set, as I say, of 12 minutes to maybe several hours.

2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:07.480
 I should just mention with long duration type work,

2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:10.060
 you could even imagine raking in the yard or mowing a lawn,

2:01:10.060 --> 2:01:11.340
 depending on how big that lawn is.

2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:13.880
 I used to have a job when I was a kid mowing lawns,

2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:15.440
 and I'll tell you,

2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:17.440
 we didn't have many neighbors with very big lawns,

2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:19.500
 but there are a few of them felt huge

2:01:19.500 --> 2:01:20.940
 because they were really convoluted.

2:01:20.940 --> 2:01:22.180
 And if you're pushing that mower,

2:01:22.180 --> 2:01:23.340
 and these were the old fashioned mowers,

2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:24.740
 not electric mowers, it's work.

2:01:24.740 --> 2:01:26.540
 That's also of the sort that we call

2:01:26.540 --> 2:01:28.420
 long duration endurance work.

2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:31.620
 High intensity training will tap into yet other fuel sources

2:01:31.620 --> 2:01:34.600
 and mechanisms as we learned today.

2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.540

 I know ad reads are not the first thing

2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:50.500
 that people want to hear when they're getting ready

2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:51.980
 to consume scientific information.

2:02:51.980 --> 2:02:54.700

2:02:57.500 --> 2:03:00.340
 about science and science-related tools to everybody.

2:03:00.340 --> 2:03:03.020
 So if you have the means, check out the sponsors.

2:03:03.020 --> 2:03:05.060
 We only work with sponsors whose products

2:03:05.060 --> 2:03:07.140
 we really believe in and that I actually use

2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:08.580
 and really love.

2:03:08.580 --> 2:03:10.220
 There's no obligation, however,

2:03:10.220 --> 2:03:13.540
 and we do talk about supplements from time to time.

2:03:13.540 --> 2:03:15.540
 Again, no obligation to use supplements.

2:03:15.540 --> 2:03:17.480
 We also talk about behavioral tools,

2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:19.440
 but if you are interested in supplements,

2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:22.100
 please go to examine.com to evaluate those supplements

2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:24.860
 and their various effects if you're curious about that.

2:03:24.860 --> 2:03:29.280
 And we work with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:31.980
 Thorne is a supplement manufacturer

2:03:31.980 --> 2:03:34.320
 that we believe has the highest levels of stringency

2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:36.720
 in terms of the quality of the supplements

2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:39.860
 and they are very precise and very stringent

2:03:39.860 --> 2:03:42.900
 about the amounts of each of those compounds

2:03:42.900 --> 2:03:44.020
 in the given supplements.

2:03:44.020 --> 2:03:47.300
 This is a huge problem elsewhere in the supplement industry.

2:03:47.300 --> 2:03:50.120
 Many brands don't include what they say they include

2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:50.960
 on the bottle.

2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:53.360
 This seems to show up every time people

2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:56.540
 test different brands, but Thorne continually tests out

2:03:56.540 --> 2:03:59.220
 with the highest levels of accuracy and stringency.

2:03:59.220 --> 2:04:00.920
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:05.620
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:07.680
 And if you do that, you can see all the supplements

2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:10.820
 that I take, you can get 20% off any of those supplements

2:04:10.820 --> 2:04:14.620
 as well if you want to navigate into the main Thorne site

2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:16.580
 and you see a supplement that you're interested in,

2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:19.620
 you'll also get 20% off any of those supplements as well.

2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:23.380
 So that's thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:26.700
 So we have both cost-free and other ways

2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:28.500
 to help support the podcast.

2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:31.620
 If you know people that might be interested in the podcast

2:04:31.620 --> 2:04:33.220
 and benefit from the information,

2:04:33.220 --> 2:04:35.220
 please recommend it to them, that really helps us.

2:04:35.220 --> 2:04:38.300
 If you're on Instagram, check us out at Huberman Lab.

2:04:38.300 --> 2:04:40.460
 If you're on Twitter, it's also Huberman Lab.

2:04:40.460 --> 2:04:41.940
 And please check out our new website,

2:04:41.940 --> 2:04:43.940
 which is HubermanLab.com.

2:04:43.940 --> 2:04:46.660
 There you can find all the episodes of all the podcasts

2:04:46.660 --> 2:04:49.480
 batched according to topic in every format,

2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:51.900
 YouTube, Apple, and Spotify, with links out to those.

2:04:51.900 --> 2:04:54.460
 It's searchable by keywords that you're interested in.

2:04:54.460 --> 2:04:56.740
 So sleep or exercise, weight, training, strength,

2:04:56.740 --> 2:04:58.500
 fat loss, et cetera.

2:04:58.500 --> 2:05:01.560
 And you can subscribe to our newsletter, The Neural Network,

2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:04.100
 which will allow you to get zero cost updates

2:05:04.100 --> 2:05:07.620
 about speaking events, about any book releases

2:05:07.620 --> 2:05:09.500
 or exciting things that I'm reading

2:05:09.500 --> 2:05:11.700
 that I think you would enjoy reading as well,

2:05:11.700 --> 2:05:13.420
 as well as protocols related to science

2:05:13.420 --> 2:05:16.260
 and some summary and important notes from the podcast.

2:05:16.260 --> 2:05:20.180
 And last but not least, on behalf of myself and Costello,

2:05:20.180 --> 2:05:24.020
 who's finally waking up for, oh no, he went back to sleep.

2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:25.820
 Thank you for your interest in science.

2:05:25.820 --> 2:05:34.340
 I'll see you in the next one.
