00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.320
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.280
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.280 --> 00:15.220
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.280
 Today, we're discussing alcohol,

00:17.280 --> 00:19.180
 one of the most commonly consumed substances

00:19.180 --> 00:20.520
 on the planet Earth.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.220
 I should mention that both humans and non-human animals

00:23.220 --> 00:26.680
 consume alcohol either for recreational purposes

00:26.680 --> 00:29.760
 because they like the feeling that it gives them

00:29.760 --> 00:31.460
 or for medicinal purposes

00:31.460 --> 00:33.840
 or for other purposes that we'll discuss.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.520
 We are, of course, going to discuss the effects of alcohol

00:36.520 --> 00:37.760
 on our biology,

00:37.760 --> 00:40.500
 ranging from its effects on individual cells,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.880
 on organs and organ systems in our brain and body.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.680
 We are also going to discuss the effects

00:45.680 --> 00:47.460
 of the effects of alcohol.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.960
 That is what being inebriated really does

00:49.960 --> 00:52.440
 to our thinking and our behavior and how it does it.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.920
 And we are going to address what seems to be

00:53.920 --> 00:55.900
 one of the more common questions out there,

00:55.900 --> 00:59.200
 which is whether or not low to moderate amounts of drinking

00:59.200 --> 01:00.360
 are better for our health

01:00.360 --> 01:03.680
 than zero alcohol consumption at all.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.240
 And of course, we will talk about severe alcohol intake,

01:07.240 --> 01:08.560
 binge drinking.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.240
 We will also talk about hangover

01:10.240 --> 01:12.060
 and what science says about ways

01:12.060 --> 01:14.480
 to reduce the effects of hangover,

01:14.480 --> 01:16.440
 either by doing things that are inoculatory,

01:16.440 --> 01:19.080
 meaning before you drink or while you drink,

01:19.080 --> 01:22.640
 as well as things to do if you happen to have a hangover.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.560
 We will discuss some of the genetic differences

01:24.560 --> 01:26.660
 for alcohol and alcoholism,

01:26.660 --> 01:31.280
 and we will discuss alcohol consumption in young people

01:31.280 --> 01:33.440
 and how that can be especially detrimental

01:33.440 --> 01:35.520
 for reasons that I think are going to be quite surprising

01:35.520 --> 01:36.360
 to most of you.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.260
 My goal is that by the end of today's episode,

01:38.260 --> 01:39.720
 you will have a thorough understanding

01:39.720 --> 01:41.740
 of what alcohol does to your brain and body,

01:41.740 --> 01:44.080
 and that you will be able to make informed decisions

01:44.080 --> 01:46.400
 as to whether or not you should be consuming

01:46.400 --> 01:48.840
 zero, absolutely no alcohol,

01:48.840 --> 01:51.080
 small to moderate amounts of alcohol.

01:51.080 --> 01:54.200
 And again, we'll define exactly what that means,

01:54.200 --> 01:55.960
 small to moderate amounts.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.080
 And if you or somebody else that you know

01:58.080 --> 02:00.380
 is consuming excessive amounts of alcohol

02:00.380 --> 02:02.520
 that are clearly detrimental to your health,

02:02.520 --> 02:05.800
 some of the better routes and resources that you can use

02:05.800 --> 02:09.200
 in order to remove that dependence and or consumption.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.400
 I'd like to preface all of that by saying that

02:12.400 --> 02:14.320
 today's discussion is really geared

02:14.320 --> 02:16.320
 toward giving you information.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
 It is not about judging alcohol intake

02:18.320 --> 02:19.960
 or lack of alcohol intake.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.720
 I just want you to be able to make

02:21.720 --> 02:25.220
 the most informed decision about alcohol possible.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.120
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:27.120 --> 02:29.440
 is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.660
 We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.360
 First of all, they ship internationally

02:33.360 --> 02:35.280
 because we know that many of you are located

02:35.280 --> 02:36.760
 outside of the United States.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.780
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

02:38.780 --> 02:41.320
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

02:41.320 --> 02:43.000
 both in terms of purity and precision

02:43.000 --> 02:44.940
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

02:44.940 --> 02:47.580
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

02:47.580 --> 02:49.760
 that are single ingredient supplements

02:49.760 --> 02:52.560
 and that are supplied in dosages that allow you

02:52.560 --> 02:54.800
 to build a supplementation protocol

02:54.800 --> 02:56.640
 that's optimized for cost,

02:56.640 --> 02:58.520
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

02:58.520 --> 03:00.660
 and that you can add things and remove things

03:00.660 --> 03:02.960
 from your protocol in a way that's really systematic

03:02.960 --> 03:03.800
 and scientific.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.960
 If you'd like to see the supplements

03:04.960 --> 03:06.280
 that we partner with Momentus on,

03:06.280 --> 03:09.380
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

03:09.380 --> 03:10.520
 There you'll see those supplements

03:10.520 --> 03:12.980
 and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

03:12.980 --> 03:15.680
 the library of supplements available through Momentus

03:15.680 --> 03:16.620
 on a regular basis.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.200
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.880
 Before we get into today's content in detail,

03:21.880 --> 03:24.200
 I just want to answer a commonly asked question

03:24.200 --> 03:26.480
 about alcohol consumption and the brain.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.920
 And the question that so often comes up

03:28.920 --> 03:31.920
 is whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.600
 so maybe one drink a day or one or two drinks a day

03:34.600 --> 03:38.420
 kind of thing, whether or not that is bad for your brain,

03:38.420 --> 03:40.600
 in particular, whether or not it causes degeneration

03:40.600 --> 03:41.980
 of neurons or nerve cells.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.280
 Now, the reason that question comes up so often

03:44.280 --> 03:46.440
 is because for many years it's been known

03:46.440 --> 03:48.340
 that high levels of alcohol consumption,

03:48.340 --> 03:52.360
 so 12 to 24 drinks per week or more,

03:52.360 --> 03:55.080
 is certainly causing neurodegeneration,

03:55.080 --> 03:56.920
 in particular of the so-called neocortex,

03:56.920 --> 03:58.760
 the outer layers of the brain

03:58.760 --> 04:00.840
 that house associative memories,

04:00.840 --> 04:03.160
 that house our ability to think and plan,

04:03.160 --> 04:07.720
 that house our ability to regulate our more primitive drives

04:07.720 --> 04:10.320
 according to context, et cetera.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.360
 So to make very clear, drinking a lot,

04:13.360 --> 04:16.780
 so having three or four drinks per night

04:16.780 --> 04:19.660
 every night of the week is clearly bad for the brain.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.760
 A recent study, however, finally addressed the question

04:22.760 --> 04:25.120
 of whether or not low to moderate amounts

04:25.120 --> 04:28.840
 of alcohol consumption can cause brain degeneration.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.800
 The title of the study is

04:30.800 --> 04:32.960
 Associations Between Alcohol Consumption

04:32.960 --> 04:36.440
 and Gray and White Matter Volumes in the UK Biobank,

04:36.440 --> 04:38.420
 the United Kingdom Biobank.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.580
 First of all, gray matter are the neurons,

04:40.580 --> 04:41.880
 it's the so-called cell bodies

04:41.880 --> 04:43.760
 that house the genome of the cells, et cetera,

04:43.760 --> 04:46.800
 and white matter is the connections, the fibers,

04:46.800 --> 04:48.760
 the so-called axons of neurons,

04:48.760 --> 04:50.200
 and it's called white matter

04:50.200 --> 04:52.960
 because that tissue is surrounded

04:52.960 --> 04:54.480
 by a fatty tissue called myelin,

04:54.480 --> 04:55.720
 which allows nerve cells

04:55.720 --> 04:57.600
 to communicate with each other very quickly.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.600
 So what this study did is it looked at the brains,

05:00.600 --> 05:02.480
 both the gray matter and the white matter,

05:02.480 --> 05:06.480
 of more than 30,000, indeed more than 35,000

05:06.480 --> 05:09.160
 generally healthy middle-aged and older adults

05:09.160 --> 05:10.360
 in the United Kingdom

05:10.360 --> 05:13.480
 who were drinking various amounts of alcohol.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.160
 What they found was that even for people

05:16.160 --> 05:20.000
 that were drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.440
 so one or two drinks per day,

05:23.680 --> 05:27.040
 there was evidence of thinning of the neocortex,

05:27.040 --> 05:30.820
 so loss of neurons in the neocortex and other brain regions.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.960
 And I don't say this in order to cause alarm.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.080
 I tell you this because they are important data

05:36.080 --> 05:39.600
 because they reveal and indeed answer the question

05:39.600 --> 05:40.960
 that has been burning for so long

05:40.960 --> 05:44.320
 as to whether or not chronic alcohol intake

05:44.320 --> 05:45.440
 can disrupt the brain,

05:45.440 --> 05:47.680
 even if the chronic intake is very low.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.480
 Now, we should talk about what the word chronic means

05:49.480 --> 05:52.060
 because many people, when they hear the word chronic,

05:52.060 --> 05:56.000
 think high levels of whatever intake, okay?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.900
 So they think five drinks a night or 10 drinks a night

05:58.900 --> 06:00.920
 or people drinking every night.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.380
 Now, in this study, they looked at people who on average

06:03.380 --> 06:06.000
 were drinking one or two drinks per night.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.360
 So that could be 14 drinks on the weekend.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.840
 It could be one drink per night.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.980
 It could be seven drinks on Friday.

06:13.980 --> 06:17.060
 In other words, on average, one or two drinks per night.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.120
 And I think many people out there are drinking

06:19.120 --> 06:23.100
 somewhere between one and two drinks per night

06:23.100 --> 06:24.920
 or day of the week on average.

06:24.920 --> 06:28.180
 So that would be seven to 14 drinks per week.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.080
 So this is an important study because it says

06:30.080 --> 06:32.960
 that if you're consuming even just seven glasses of wine

06:32.960 --> 06:35.880
 across the week, it's likely that there is going to be

06:35.880 --> 06:37.580
 some degeneration of your brain

06:37.580 --> 06:40.160
 in response to that alcohol intake.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.960
 Although, as mentioned earlier,

06:41.960 --> 06:43.200
 we will talk about some of the things

06:43.200 --> 06:46.320
 that can inoculate against some of that neuronal loss.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.800
 For those of you that are interested in reading the study

06:48.800 --> 06:50.920
 in more detail, we put a link to it

06:50.920 --> 06:52.360
 in the show note captions.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.920
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

06:54.920 --> 06:57.460
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.600
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

06:59.600 --> 07:02.040
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

07:02.040 --> 07:04.700
 and science-related tools to the general public.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.720
 In keeping with that theme,

07:05.720 --> 07:08.500
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.480
 Our first sponsor is Levels.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.040
 Levels is a program that lets you see

07:12.040 --> 07:13.920
 how different foods affect your health

07:13.920 --> 07:15.980
 by giving you real-time feedback on your diet

07:15.980 --> 07:18.420
 using a continuous glucose monitor.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.240
 One of the most important features

07:20.240 --> 07:22.500
 of our immediate feelings of wellbeing

07:22.500 --> 07:25.320
 and our ability to focus and think and move and have energy,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.700
 as well as our long-term health,

07:27.700 --> 07:29.880
 are our blood glucose levels.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.400
 That is our blood sugar levels.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.080
 And that's because all the cells and tissues of our body,

07:34.080 --> 07:36.000
 and especially neurons, nerve cells,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.360
 rely on glucose for fuel.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.220
 I realize some of you out there are ketogenic,

07:40.220 --> 07:41.740
 and yes, you can use ketones for fuel,

07:41.740 --> 07:44.240
 but the vast majority of people are using glucose

07:44.240 --> 07:46.560
 for fuel in their cells.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.820
 If you want to maintain energy and focus throughout the day,

07:48.820 --> 07:51.400
 you want to keep that blood glucose steady,

07:51.400 --> 07:55.200
 and you don't want it ever to spike or to drop too much.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.760
 So you need to understand how different foods

07:56.760 --> 07:58.260
 and indeed how different activities

07:58.260 --> 07:59.520
 impact your blood glucose.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.480
 I started using Levels about a year ago

08:01.480 --> 08:04.480
 as a way to understand how different foods and exercise

08:04.480 --> 08:06.900
 and supplements and combinations of food and exercise

08:06.900 --> 08:08.480
 and even sequencing, like when I do what,

08:08.480 --> 08:10.120
 how that affects my blood glucose levels,

08:10.120 --> 08:11.920
 has been tremendously informative.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.000
 It's completely reshaped when I exercise, how I exercise,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.980
 when I eat relative to exercise, et cetera.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.800
 So if you're interested in learning more about Levels

08:18.800 --> 08:21.200
 and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,

08:21.200 --> 08:23.760
 go to levels.link slash Huberman.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.380
 Again, that's levels.link slash Huberman.

08:27.380 --> 08:30.100
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.240
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,

08:32.240 --> 08:34.540
 heating, and sleep tracking capacity.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.900
 I've talked many times on the podcast about the fact

08:36.900 --> 08:40.400
 that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation

08:40.400 --> 08:42.000
 of mental health, physical health,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.720
 and all forms of performance.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.420
 And one of the key variables in getting a great night's sleep

08:46.420 --> 08:48.120
 is making sure that your sleeping environment

08:48.120 --> 08:49.320
 is the right temperature.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.240
 Indeed, your brain and body have to drop

08:51.240 --> 08:54.280
 by one to three degrees in order to get into sleep

08:54.280 --> 08:57.340
 and to stay in deep sleep throughout the night.

08:57.340 --> 08:59.360
 If your room is too hot or if you're running too warm,

08:59.360 --> 09:00.240
 you will wake up.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.480
 In fact, that is why you wake up in the morning.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.520
 With Eight Sleep, you can adjust the temperature

09:04.520 --> 09:06.960
 of your mattress and your overall sleeping environment

09:06.960 --> 09:08.880
 and customize that to you.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.440
 I started using Eight Sleep some time ago

09:11.440 --> 09:13.640
 and it's just been a total game changer.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.800
 I program mine so that there's a subtle drop

09:15.800 --> 09:16.840
 in the temperature of my mattress

09:16.840 --> 09:17.680
 at the beginning of the night

09:17.680 --> 09:19.000
 and then it gets progressively cooler

09:19.000 --> 09:20.800
 and then it heats up toward morning.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.680
 Even has this nice little vibrate feature.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.120
 So it wakes me up by vibrating the mattress a little bit.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.700
 And of course that mattress is warming

09:27.700 --> 09:29.360
 and warming is the way that we wake up.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.680

 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.700
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

09:49.700 --> 09:51.520
 that are of the absolute highest quality

09:51.520 --> 09:54.000
 and they also have some unique characteristics.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.120
 The company was founded by two all American swimmers

09:56.120 --> 09:58.560
 from Stanford and everything about Roka eyeglasses

09:58.560 --> 10:01.680
 and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.720
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses can be worn while running

10:04.720 --> 10:05.560
 or cycling.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.720
 If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face

10:07.720 --> 10:09.000
 and they're extremely lightweight.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.440
 In fact, most of the time I can't even remember

10:10.440 --> 10:11.500
 that I'm wearing them.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.780
 I wear Roka eyeglasses when I read at night.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.080
 So I wear their readers and I wear sunglasses

10:16.080 --> 10:17.680
 at various times throughout the day.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.720
 The great thing about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

10:19.720 --> 10:21.080
 is that even though they were designed

10:21.080 --> 10:24.040
 for athletic performance, they have a terrific aesthetic.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.580
 So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses

10:26.580 --> 10:29.420
 that make people look like cyborgs in my opinion,

10:29.420 --> 10:31.160
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are the sort

10:31.160 --> 10:32.240
 that you could wear out to dinner,

10:32.240 --> 10:33.420
 that you could wear to work.

10:33.420 --> 10:34.860
 They have a terrific aesthetic.

10:34.860 --> 10:37.040

10:47.140 --> 10:49.160
 Let's talk about alcohol and let's just acknowledge

10:49.160 --> 10:50.680
 that human beings have been consuming alcohol

10:50.680 --> 10:52.040
 for thousands of years.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.520
 If you look at the archeological evidence from Mesopotamia,

10:54.520 --> 10:57.160
 you'll find that 5,000 years ago people had wine vessels

10:57.160 --> 10:59.340
 or if you want to know when people first started

10:59.340 --> 11:01.820
 distilling alcohol, much to people's surprise

11:01.820 --> 11:03.880
 that did not first take place in Ireland

11:03.880 --> 11:05.120
 and that's not a joke about the Irish

11:05.120 --> 11:06.720
 that you'll see a lot of claims online

11:06.720 --> 11:08.600
 that the Irish were the first to distill alcohol

11:08.600 --> 11:10.200
 but in fact they were not.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.520
 It was the Chinese that were the first to distill alcohol

11:12.520 --> 11:15.320
 and that took place in China in the first century.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.700
 Alcohol has been used for nutritional purposes.

11:17.700 --> 11:21.480
 So there are cultures that believe and indeed still believe

11:21.480 --> 11:23.580
 that the calories in alcohol are useful.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.580
 Although later we'll talk about how alcohol calories

11:25.580 --> 11:28.300
 are indeed empty calories and what an empty calorie

11:28.300 --> 11:30.260
 really is, why it's called empty.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.480
 Alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes

11:33.480 --> 11:35.500
 because indeed it does kill bacteria

11:35.500 --> 11:38.380
 and as you'll soon find out the fact that it kills bacteria

11:38.380 --> 11:40.700
 because that is absolutely true,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.520
 it also kills the good bacteria in your gut

11:42.520 --> 11:44.720
 and the destruction of that good bacteria in your gut

11:44.720 --> 11:47.040
 can lead to things like leaky gut syndrome

11:47.040 --> 11:48.200
 and has all sorts of issues

11:48.200 --> 11:49.560
 and there are ways to deal with those issues

11:49.560 --> 11:50.800
 and we'll talk about those.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.860
 So alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes,

11:52.860 --> 11:54.220
 it's been used to clean surfaces,

11:54.220 --> 11:56.760
 it's used in my laboratory in order to make up

11:56.760 --> 11:59.700
 so-called reagents to do our experiments

11:59.700 --> 12:02.560
 but most humans have been consuming alcohol

12:02.560 --> 12:04.360
 in order to change their internal state,

12:04.360 --> 12:07.520
 in order to feel differently than they would otherwise.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.720
 That feeling of being drunk or inebriated

12:09.720 --> 12:13.720
 or tipsy or lightheaded is something that many, not all,

12:13.720 --> 12:16.480
 but many humans seem to enjoy and pursue

12:16.480 --> 12:20.520
 even though typically it leads to a feeling

12:20.520 --> 12:24.960
 of being less happy, less motivated,

12:24.960 --> 12:28.120
 more stressed, et cetera, when the alcohol wears off.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.160
 That's pretty incredible, right?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.760
 I mean, we're talking about a substance

12:30.760 --> 12:32.800
 that people have been highly motivated to pursue

12:32.800 --> 12:34.960
 that are still highly motivated to pursue,

12:34.960 --> 12:38.480
 to create and to consume, that they'll spend money on

12:38.480 --> 12:41.920
 and that's despite the fact that it makes them feel good

12:41.920 --> 12:43.480
 and then it makes them feel lousy.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.480
 Now, some of you might be saying,

12:44.480 --> 12:46.440
 well, I drink but I don't drink to excess

12:46.440 --> 12:48.080
 and therefore I don't feel lousy,

12:48.080 --> 12:50.120
 I feel good when I drink and then it wears off

12:50.120 --> 12:51.700
 and it allows me to get through my evening

12:51.700 --> 12:53.880
 and then the next morning I'm ready to go.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.480
 Okay, that very well may be true, I believe those people

12:58.480 --> 13:00.120
 and as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

13:00.120 --> 13:02.720
 I'm not here to demonize alcohol in any way

13:02.720 --> 13:05.680
 but I do want to point out what alcohol is

13:05.680 --> 13:08.580
 and how it creates the effects that it does

13:08.580 --> 13:11.400
 and then I want to talk about what those effects are

13:11.400 --> 13:14.760
 when you engage in consuming alcohol

13:14.760 --> 13:17.560
 even as often as one or two nights per week

13:17.560 --> 13:19.720
 or let's say you're just somebody who has a drink or two

13:19.720 --> 13:21.740
 on Friday, maybe a few more on Saturday

13:21.740 --> 13:24.240
 or maybe you're somebody who consumes all your alcohol

13:24.240 --> 13:25.920
 one night per week or one night per month,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.380
 we'll talk about how that's affecting your biology.

13:28.380 --> 13:31.120
 So let's address what alcohol is

13:31.120 --> 13:32.700
 and how it affects the cells and tissues

13:32.700 --> 13:33.740
 and organs of your body,

13:33.740 --> 13:36.200
 then we'll take a look at some of the epidemiology,

13:36.200 --> 13:38.260
 that is how many people are consuming alcohol

13:38.260 --> 13:39.760
 and how much they're drinking

13:39.760 --> 13:42.700
 and then you will be able I think to get a good sense

13:42.700 --> 13:44.560
 of how the alcohol that you're drinking,

13:44.560 --> 13:46.880
 if you're drinking any at all,

13:46.880 --> 13:48.480
 is impacting your brain and body

13:48.480 --> 13:50.180
 and the choices you might want to make

13:50.180 --> 13:52.760
 about how and when to drink alcohol

13:52.760 --> 13:55.160
 or even if you want to eliminate alcohol altogether.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.160
 Okay, so some basic chemistry and biology of alcohol

13:58.160 --> 13:59.720
 and again, I'll make this very clear

13:59.720 --> 14:02.480
 even if you don't have a chemistry and biology background,

14:02.480 --> 14:04.800
 because of the structure of alcohol,

14:04.800 --> 14:08.860
 it is what's called both water soluble and fat soluble,

14:08.860 --> 14:11.540
 translated into what's meaningful for you,

14:11.540 --> 14:13.840
 what that means is when you drink alcohol,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.560
 it can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body,

14:17.560 --> 14:20.920
 it has no trouble just passing right into those cells,

14:20.920 --> 14:23.860
 so unlike a lot of substances and drugs

14:23.860 --> 14:26.860
 that actually attach to the surface of cells to receptors

14:26.860 --> 14:28.360
 as they're called, little parking spots

14:28.360 --> 14:31.500
 and then trigger a bunch of downstreams

14:31.500 --> 14:33.860
 like domino cascades of effects,

14:33.860 --> 14:36.720
 alcohol actually has its own direct effects on cells

14:36.720 --> 14:39.460
 because it can really just pass into those cells,

14:39.460 --> 14:41.960
 so it's water and fat soluble

14:41.960 --> 14:45.160
 and the fact that it can pass into so many organs and cells

14:45.160 --> 14:49.440
 so easily is really what explains its damaging effects,

14:49.440 --> 14:52.040
 I should mention that there are three main types of alcohol,

14:52.040 --> 14:55.440
 there's isopropyl, methyl and ethyl alcohol

14:55.440 --> 14:58.560
 and only the last one ethyl alcohol or ethanol

14:58.560 --> 15:03.120
 is fit for human consumption, however, it is still toxic,

15:03.120 --> 15:07.880
 okay, it produces substantial stress and damage to cells,

15:07.880 --> 15:09.340
 I'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,

15:09.340 --> 15:10.900
 but that's just a fact,

15:10.900 --> 15:14.400
 ethanol produces substantial damage to cells

15:14.400 --> 15:17.720
 and it does that because when you ingest ethanol,

15:17.720 --> 15:19.520
 it has to be converted into something else

15:19.520 --> 15:21.640
 because it is toxic to the body

15:21.640 --> 15:25.080
 and there's a molecule inside of all of us called NAD

15:25.080 --> 15:27.700
 and you may have heard of NAD because it's quite popular,

15:27.700 --> 15:30.140
 there's a lot of discussion about NAD

15:30.140 --> 15:32.000
 in the longevity literature right now,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.680
 NAD is present in all our cells from birth until death,

15:34.680 --> 15:37.400
 the levels of NAD tend to go down across the lifespan,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.720
 there are ideas that increasing levels of NAD

15:39.720 --> 15:42.300
 may extend lifespan, a lot of that is still controversial

15:42.300 --> 15:43.880
 or at least we should say is ongoing

15:43.880 --> 15:45.240
 in terms of the research,

15:45.240 --> 15:47.520
 but nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,

15:47.520 --> 15:50.160
 NAD and related biochemical pathways

15:50.160 --> 15:52.440
 are involved in converting that ethanol

15:52.440 --> 15:54.040
 into something called acetaldehyde,

15:54.040 --> 15:56.540
 it's broken down into acetaldehyde

15:56.540 --> 15:58.120
 and if you thought ethanol was bad,

15:58.120 --> 15:59.940
 acetaldehyde is particularly bad,

15:59.940 --> 16:03.040
 acetaldehyde is poison, it will kill cells,

16:03.040 --> 16:05.840
 it damages and kill cells and it is indiscriminate

16:05.840 --> 16:08.960
 as to which cells it damages and kills,

16:08.960 --> 16:11.840
 now that's a problem obviously

16:11.840 --> 16:14.000
 and the body deals with that problem

16:14.000 --> 16:18.400
 by using another component of the NAD biochemical pathway

16:18.400 --> 16:22.680
 to convert acetaldehyde into something called acetate,

16:22.680 --> 16:23.960
 acetate is actually something

16:23.960 --> 16:26.220
 that your body can use as fuel

16:26.220 --> 16:29.440
 and that process of going from ethanol

16:29.440 --> 16:31.200
 to acetaldehyde to acetate

16:32.400 --> 16:35.400
 does involve the production of a toxic molecule, right?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.600
 Again, acetaldehyde is really toxic

16:37.600 --> 16:40.080
 and NAD and if we want to get technical,

16:40.080 --> 16:43.480
 it's the NAD to NADH ratio

16:43.480 --> 16:46.320
 and that chemical step

16:46.320 --> 16:48.680
 is the rate limiting step to ethanol's metabolism,

16:48.680 --> 16:50.180
 what does that mean for you?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.460
 What that means is that if your body

16:52.460 --> 16:54.400
 can't do this conversion of ethanol

16:54.400 --> 16:57.180
 to acetaldehyde to acetate fast enough,

16:57.180 --> 16:59.540
 well, acetaldehyde will build up in your body

16:59.540 --> 17:01.180
 and cause more damage,

17:01.180 --> 17:03.060
 so it's important that your body

17:03.060 --> 17:05.840
 be able to do this conversion very quickly

17:05.840 --> 17:09.160
 and the place where it does that is within the liver

17:09.160 --> 17:10.560
 and cells within the liver

17:10.560 --> 17:13.640
 are very good at this conversion process,

17:13.640 --> 17:15.080
 but they are cells

17:15.080 --> 17:16.960
 and they are exposed to the acetaldehyde

17:16.960 --> 17:18.600
 in the conversion process

17:18.600 --> 17:21.160
 and so cells within the liver really take a beating

17:22.240 --> 17:25.440
 in the alcohol metabolism events,

17:25.440 --> 17:27.720
 so the key thing to understand here

17:27.720 --> 17:29.460
 is that when you ingest alcohol,

17:29.460 --> 17:31.380
 you are, yes, ingesting a poison

17:31.380 --> 17:32.720
 and that poison is converted

17:32.720 --> 17:34.440
 into an even worse poison in your body

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
 and some percentage of that worst poison

17:36.440 --> 17:38.500
 is converted into a form of calories

17:38.500 --> 17:42.200
 that you can use to generate energy, generate ATP

17:42.200 --> 17:45.480
 and the reason why alcohol is considered empty calories

17:45.480 --> 17:48.740
 is because that entire process is very metabolically costly,

17:48.740 --> 17:51.080
 but there's no real nutritive value

17:51.080 --> 17:53.360
 of the calories that it creates.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.280
 You can use it for immediate energy,

17:55.280 --> 17:56.600
 but it can't be stored

17:56.600 --> 17:58.800
 in any kind of meaningful or beneficial way,

17:58.800 --> 18:00.440
 it doesn't provide any vitamins,

18:00.440 --> 18:02.120
 it doesn't provide any amino acids,

18:02.120 --> 18:04.000
 it doesn't provide any fatty acids,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.880
 it's truly empty calories.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.960
 I know some people talk about sugar as empty calories,

18:07.960 --> 18:10.640
 but sugar actually is a far better fuel source

18:10.640 --> 18:13.160
 than alcohol or acetate,

18:13.160 --> 18:16.100
 but nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,

18:16.100 --> 18:19.240
 some percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison

18:19.240 --> 18:22.660
 and some is being shuttled into a fuel source.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.400
 Now, the important thing to understand

18:24.400 --> 18:28.260
 is that it is the poison, the acetaldehyde itself,

18:28.260 --> 18:32.760
 that leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.060
 I think most people don't realize that,

18:34.060 --> 18:38.400
 that being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption

18:38.400 --> 18:40.320
 in the way that your neural circuits work.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.960
 And so we should ask ourselves,

18:41.960 --> 18:44.240
 which neural circuits, what brain areas,

18:44.240 --> 18:47.740
 what body areas involved in feeling drunk or inebriated?

18:47.740 --> 18:50.040
 Now, when thinking about this state of being tipsy

18:50.040 --> 18:53.440
 or happy or really drunk or a little bit drunk,

18:53.440 --> 18:54.660
 I want to mention something

18:54.660 --> 18:56.920
 I think most people aren't aware of,

18:56.920 --> 18:59.040
 and that's the fact that for people

18:59.040 --> 19:00.680
 that are regular drinkers

19:00.680 --> 19:04.920
 or that have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism,

19:04.920 --> 19:08.240
 when they drink, they tend to feel very energized

19:08.240 --> 19:11.540
 and very good for longer periods of time.

19:11.540 --> 19:14.080
 Again, people have a genetic predisposition to alcohol

19:14.080 --> 19:15.520
 or people who are chronic drinkers,

19:15.520 --> 19:17.200
 or even just, if you recall,

19:17.200 --> 19:19.460
 chronic doesn't have to mean a ton of alcohol,

19:19.460 --> 19:21.080
 but they're drinking one or two per night

19:21.080 --> 19:22.880
 or they're every other night type drinkers

19:22.880 --> 19:24.640
 or Thursday through Sunday drinkers.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.840
 Those people typically experience an increase

19:28.840 --> 19:31.000
 in alertness and mood when they drink,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.640
 whereas occasional drinkers will have a briefer,

19:34.640 --> 19:36.880
 meaning less long lasting,

19:36.880 --> 19:38.800
 period of feeling good when they drink

19:38.800 --> 19:41.620
 and then more quickly transition into a state

19:41.620 --> 19:44.440
 in which they're tired or they start losing motor skills,

19:44.440 --> 19:46.040
 they start slurring their speech.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.620
 I also want to emphasize this is distinct from tolerance.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.800
 We'll talk about tolerance later

19:50.800 --> 19:52.520
 and exactly what tolerance means,

19:52.520 --> 19:53.900
 but I really want to highlight the fact

19:53.900 --> 19:56.960
 that when people ingest this poison,

19:56.960 --> 19:59.080
 because indeed it is poison,

19:59.080 --> 20:01.040
 the range of effects is very different

20:01.040 --> 20:04.120
 and you can reliably predict who are the people

20:04.120 --> 20:06.400
 with a predisposition to alcoholism

20:06.400 --> 20:09.240
 and who are the people who are more regular drinkers

20:09.240 --> 20:12.480
 by the contour, the timing of the different effects.

20:12.480 --> 20:16.800
 And again, people who tend to feel more alert and excited

20:16.800 --> 20:19.560
 every time they drink, they tend to get a real lift.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.000
 They become kind of the life of the party

20:21.000 --> 20:23.320
 and that lasts a long while.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.040
 Those people are the ones that really have to be careful

20:26.040 --> 20:29.080
 about predisposition for alcoholism.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.620
 And those people also need to be careful

20:31.620 --> 20:34.000
 about their drinking and the amount of drinking

20:34.000 --> 20:37.420
 that they're doing, even if they're not full-blown alcoholics

20:37.420 --> 20:39.800
 Now, of course, people who are ingesting alcohol,

20:39.800 --> 20:41.120
 who are not accustomed to drinking alcohol

20:41.120 --> 20:43.560
 have to be concerned about drinking alcohol for other reasons

20:43.560 --> 20:46.680
 because it can impair motor function and judgment, et cetera.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.800
 But in thinking about the biochemical effects of alcohol

20:49.800 --> 20:51.600
 and what it's doing to the body,

20:51.600 --> 20:56.600
 what it's doing in all cases is it's consumed into the gut,

20:57.000 --> 20:57.840
 goes into the stomach.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.700
 The liver immediately starts this conversion

20:59.700 --> 21:02.000
 that we talked about before of ethanol to acetaldehyde

21:02.000 --> 21:05.040
 to acetate and some amount of acetaldehyde and acetate

21:05.040 --> 21:06.180
 are making it into the brain.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.640
 It crosses the blood-brain barrier.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.580
 Again, the brain has this fence around it

21:09.580 --> 21:12.120
 that we call the blood-brain barrier or the BBB.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.640
 Many things, most things thankfully,

21:14.640 --> 21:16.800
 can't pass across the blood-brain barrier,

21:16.800 --> 21:19.040
 but alcohol because it's water and fat soluble

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
 just cruises right across this fence

21:21.040 --> 21:24.220
 and into the milieu, the environment of the brain,

21:24.220 --> 21:26.340
 which is made up of a couple of different major cell types,

21:26.340 --> 21:28.640
 neurons, nerve cells, and so-called glial cells,

21:28.640 --> 21:30.640
 which are in between the nerve cells.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.640
 And we'll talk about the effects on each of those soon.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.560
 So what happens when alcohol gets into the brain

21:35.560 --> 21:37.100
 that makes us feel tipsy or drunk

21:37.100 --> 21:39.980
 and in some people makes people feel really,

21:39.980 --> 21:42.040
 especially energized and happy?

21:42.040 --> 21:44.900
 Well, alcohol is indiscriminate

21:44.900 --> 21:47.540
 in terms of which brain areas it goes to.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.980
 Again, it doesn't bind to particular receptors,

21:49.980 --> 21:53.920
 but it does seem to have a propensity or an affinity

21:53.920 --> 21:55.560
 for particular brain areas that are involved

21:55.560 --> 21:57.280
 in certain kinds of thinking and behavior.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.400
 So one of the first things that happens

21:59.400 --> 22:01.200
 is that there's a slight,

22:01.200 --> 22:04.100
 at least after the first drink or second drink,

22:04.100 --> 22:07.600
 there's a slight suppression in the activity of neurons

22:07.600 --> 22:08.980
 in the prefrontal cortex.

22:08.980 --> 22:11.240
 This is an area of your neocortex

22:11.240 --> 22:13.300
 that's involved in thinking and planning

22:13.300 --> 22:18.300
 and perhaps above all in suppression of impulsive behavior.

22:18.300 --> 22:21.420
 So if you go to a party and they're serving alcohol

22:21.420 --> 22:22.980
 and people are consuming drinks,

22:22.980 --> 22:25.960
 what you'll notice is that a few minutes into that party,

22:25.960 --> 22:28.240
 the volume of people's voices will increase.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.440
 And that's because people are simply not paying attention

22:30.440 --> 22:31.680
 to their voice modulation.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.420
 As other people start speaking more loudly,

22:33.420 --> 22:34.640
 other people are speaking more loudly.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.560
 We've all had this experience, right, of going to a party

22:36.560 --> 22:38.360
 and then you step outside for a moment and you go,

22:38.360 --> 22:39.680
 oh my goodness, I was shouting.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.400
 You come home the next day, you got a sore throat.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.200
 It might be that you picked up some sort of bug,

22:43.200 --> 22:44.600
 some virus or something.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.520
 But oftentimes it's just the fact

22:46.520 --> 22:48.080
 you've been shouting all night just to be heard

22:48.080 --> 22:50.500
 because as the prefrontal cortex shuts down,

22:50.500 --> 22:55.040
 people stop modulating their level of speech quite as much.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.420
 Also notice that people start gesticulating more.

22:57.420 --> 22:59.760
 People will start standing up and sitting down more.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.880
 They'll start walking around more.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.700
 If there's music on,

23:01.700 --> 23:04.000
 people might spontaneously start dancing.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.160
 All of this is because these areas of the prefrontal cortex

23:07.160 --> 23:10.000
 normally are providing what's called top-down inhibition.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.160
 They are releasing a neurotransmitter called GABA

23:13.160 --> 23:14.800
 onto various parts of the brain.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.680
 They're involved in impulsive motor behavior

23:16.680 --> 23:17.940
 and thought patterns.

23:17.940 --> 23:20.040
 And as you shut down the prefrontal cortex,

23:20.040 --> 23:24.440
 that GABAergic suppression of impulses starts to be released.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.400
 So people will say things that they want to say

23:27.400 --> 23:30.360
 without so much forethought about what they're saying.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.800
 Or they might do things that they want to do

23:32.800 --> 23:34.880
 without really thinking it through quite as much

23:34.880 --> 23:37.280
 or they might not even remember thinking it through at all

23:37.280 --> 23:39.280
 or experience, I should say, thinking it through at all.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.680
 We haven't talked about blacking out yet

23:40.680 --> 23:42.560
 in the effects of alcohol on memory.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.520
 But as long as we're there,

23:43.520 --> 23:46.620
 I'll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect

23:46.620 --> 23:48.280
 in suppressing the neural networks

23:48.280 --> 23:51.160
 that are involved in memory formation and storage.

23:51.160 --> 23:55.000
 This is why oftentimes we forget the events of a night out

23:55.000 --> 23:56.780
 if we've been drinking.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.520
 One of the more important things to know

23:58.520 --> 24:01.000
 about the effects of alcohol in the brain

24:01.000 --> 24:03.840
 is this disruption in top-down inhibition,

24:03.840 --> 24:06.820
 but also that areas of the brain

24:06.820 --> 24:09.680
 that are involved in flexible behavior,

24:09.680 --> 24:11.200
 sort of considering different options,

24:11.200 --> 24:12.640
 like I could do A or I could do B.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.480
 I could say this to them or I could say that.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.600
 I could say it in that way

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
 or I could say it in this way.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.560
 This might be a little more tactful.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.680
 Those brain areas basically shut down entirely

24:21.680 --> 24:23.840
 and people just tend to say what they want to say.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.560
 So the key thing to understand is that when people drink,

24:26.560 --> 24:31.160
 the prefrontal cortex and top-down inhibition is diminished.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.280
 That is habitual behavior

24:33.280 --> 24:36.100
 and impulsive behavior starts to increase.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.180
 Now, what's interesting is this is true in the short term,

24:39.180 --> 24:40.640
 so after people have one or two,

24:40.640 --> 24:42.260
 maybe three or four drinks,

24:42.260 --> 24:47.040
 but it's also true that the more often that people drink,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.540
 there are changes in the very circuits

24:50.540 --> 24:53.640
 that underlie habitual and impulsive behavior.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.160
 This is really important to highlight,

24:55.160 --> 24:56.480
 so much so that I want to drill into it

24:56.480 --> 24:57.760
 a little bit more deeply.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.720
 For the person that drinks, say, every Thursday night

25:01.720 --> 25:02.800
 or every Friday night

25:02.800 --> 25:06.260
 or goes out only on Saturdays, but every Saturday,

25:06.260 --> 25:08.120
 there's evidence that there are changes

25:08.120 --> 25:09.720
 in the neural circuits of the brain

25:09.720 --> 25:12.800
 that control habitual behavior and impulsive behavior,

25:12.800 --> 25:15.540
 and they are modified and strengthened

25:15.540 --> 25:18.280
 in ways that make those people more habitual

25:18.280 --> 25:21.080
 and more impulsive outside the times

25:21.080 --> 25:22.700
 in which they are drinking.

25:22.700 --> 25:26.040
 And when they drink, impulsive and habitual behavior

25:26.040 --> 25:27.800
 tends to increase even further.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.120
 This is something that's not often talked about

25:30.120 --> 25:31.840
 when discussing the effects of alcohol.

25:31.840 --> 25:36.120
 And we all know the effects of being drunk can be bad,

25:36.120 --> 25:39.360
 can be bad in terms of judgment, motor coordination,

25:39.360 --> 25:41.680
 certainly driving drunk is a terrible thing,

25:41.680 --> 25:44.600
 get you or other people killed, and so on.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.640
 But rarely do we hear about the changes in neural circuits

25:47.640 --> 25:52.440
 from just one or two nights of regular drinking.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.120
 Again, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily mean

25:55.120 --> 25:56.600
 every day and every night.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.320
 It could be the person that simply drinks

25:58.320 --> 25:59.580
 every Thursday or every Friday

25:59.580 --> 26:01.220
 or just once a week has three or four drinks

26:01.220 --> 26:03.000
 or maybe even a few more.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.960
 That person is going to experience

26:04.960 --> 26:07.600
 a decrease in this top-down inhibition,

26:07.600 --> 26:09.880
 so an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior

26:09.880 --> 26:11.840
 because the break on those behaviors

26:11.840 --> 26:13.720
 has been removed while they're drinking,

26:13.720 --> 26:16.360
 but also changes in the very neural circuits

26:16.360 --> 26:19.000
 that allow habitual and impulsive behavior

26:19.000 --> 26:21.480
 to occur more readily even when they're not drinking.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.680
 And if you want to know the actual substrate for that,

26:23.680 --> 26:25.640
 the cellar substrate, I can briefly describe it.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.040
 It's really interesting.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.360
 Again, you don't need to know any biology

26:28.360 --> 26:29.240
 to understand this.

26:29.240 --> 26:33.000
 What it does is it increases the number of synapses,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.300
 the actual points of connection in the neural circuits

26:35.300 --> 26:37.780
 that control habitual behavior.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.600
 So there's literally a growth of the neural circuits

26:40.600 --> 26:44.800
 in your brain that lead to existing habit execution, right?

26:44.800 --> 26:47.180
 The performance of things you already know how to do

26:47.180 --> 26:49.760
 and a reduction in the neural circuits,

26:49.760 --> 26:52.100
 or I should say a reduction in the number of synapses

26:52.100 --> 26:54.720
 of the contacts within the neural circuits

26:54.720 --> 26:56.520
 that are controlling behavior.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.000
 So this again is a not often discussed aspect

26:59.000 --> 27:00.160
 of alcohol intake.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.200
 Fortunately, it is reversible.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.800
 So in animals or humans that undertake a period

27:05.800 --> 27:08.920
 of abstinence of anywhere from two to six months,

27:08.920 --> 27:11.260
 these neural circuits return to normal,

27:11.260 --> 27:13.720
 except in cases where people have been chronically

27:13.720 --> 27:16.280
 drinking large volumes of alcohol for many, many years.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.160
 And in those cases, while there is some recovery

27:19.160 --> 27:22.760
 of brain circuitry after people get sober,

27:22.760 --> 27:26.000
 meaning completely sober, they stop drinking entirely,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.580
 there is evidence of long lasting impact

27:28.580 --> 27:31.240
 of heavy alcohol usage throughout the lifespan.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.860
 But of course, this doesn't mean that anyone

27:32.860 --> 27:34.760
 that's suffering from alcoholism or that used to

27:34.760 --> 27:36.880
 should not continue to focus on their health.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.280
 You absolutely should, all is not lost.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.000
 But for people that have been drinking for a lot of years,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.520
 maybe you went to college and you drank a lot in those years

27:43.520 --> 27:45.380
 and your neural circuits change.

27:45.380 --> 27:47.800
 If there's a period in which you don't drink alcohol,

27:47.800 --> 27:51.580
 again, from two to six months and ideally longer,

27:51.580 --> 27:53.680
 those neural circuits can then be re-modified

27:53.680 --> 27:55.240
 back to their original state.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.760
 So let's consider some of the other neurochemical effects

27:57.760 --> 27:59.360
 of alcohol in the brain and body.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.580
 And again, for right now, we're confining the conversation

28:02.580 --> 28:04.560
 to people that are drinking on average,

28:04.560 --> 28:06.300
 one or two drinks per night.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.920
 Now, some people might think that two drinks per night

28:07.920 --> 28:10.360
 is a lot and a lot of that will depend on body weight.

28:10.360 --> 28:15.360
 So for instance, people who weigh 110 pounds,

28:15.440 --> 28:18.340
 for them to ingest two alcoholic drinks

28:18.340 --> 28:19.820
 is going to be substantially different

28:19.820 --> 28:21.580
 in terms of the biochemical effects

28:21.580 --> 28:24.260
 than somebody who weighs 220 pounds.

28:24.260 --> 28:26.840
 Of course, tolerance will also factor into this,

28:26.840 --> 28:29.480
 genetic background will also factor into this

28:29.480 --> 28:32.100
 and indeed whether or not people have eaten

28:32.100 --> 28:32.940
 will factor into this.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.000
 So there are a lot of factors and we'll talk about that.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.440
 For the time being, if you're curious about how food impacts

28:38.440 --> 28:41.360
 the effects of alcohol and your feelings of being drunk,

28:41.360 --> 28:42.560
 you may have heard, for instance,

28:42.560 --> 28:45.020
 that if somebody is inebriated and they want to sober up,

28:45.020 --> 28:48.080
 they should eat something, turns out that does not work.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.100
 Here's how it does work, however.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.280
 If you eat something prior to drinking alcohol

28:53.280 --> 28:55.800
 or while ingesting alcohol,

28:55.800 --> 28:59.700
 it will slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.000
 In other words, you won't feel as drunk as fast.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.240
 For many of you, this probably comes as no surprise.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.480
 In particular, if that meal includes carbohydrates,

29:07.480 --> 29:09.680
 fats, and proteins, okay?

29:09.680 --> 29:12.800
 The inclusion of all three major macronutrients

29:12.800 --> 29:15.640
 seems to slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream

29:15.640 --> 29:18.520
 far more than having any one of those

29:18.520 --> 29:21.200
 or two of those macronutrients present.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.700
 Now, if you are already inebriated

29:23.700 --> 29:25.840
 or you've had a glass of wine or a beer

29:25.840 --> 29:27.880
 and you eat something,

29:28.920 --> 29:30.960
 chances are that alcohol has already made it

29:30.960 --> 29:31.800
 into your bloodstream

29:31.800 --> 29:34.920
 because it moves into the bloodstream so quickly.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.060
 Again, it's fat soluble and water soluble,

29:37.060 --> 29:39.040
 so within minutes, right?

29:39.040 --> 29:40.000
 If you have an empty stomach,

29:40.000 --> 29:41.560
 within five to 10 minutes,

29:41.560 --> 29:43.320
 that alcohol is going to be within your bloodstream

29:43.320 --> 29:44.360
 and distributed throughout your body,

29:44.360 --> 29:46.640
 maybe even faster depending on the type of alcohol

29:46.640 --> 29:48.600
 and your metabolism.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.240
 But if you're already drunk and you eat something,

29:52.240 --> 29:53.780
 it's not going to sober you up more quickly,

29:53.780 --> 29:55.080
 but it certainly will blunt the effects

29:55.080 --> 29:57.900
 of any additional alcohol that you might consume.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.440
 And if you're somebody who is concerned

30:00.440 --> 30:02.160
 about getting too drunk too quick,

30:02.160 --> 30:03.400
 even from a small amount of alcohol,

30:03.400 --> 30:06.860
 having some food in your gut can certainly be beneficial.

30:06.860 --> 30:10.240
 Now, that's food and alcohol and the absorption of alcohol,

30:10.240 --> 30:13.340
 but let's go back to talking about the biochemical

30:13.340 --> 30:15.900
 and neurochemical effects of alcohol on the brain.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.960
 We talked about top-down inhibition

30:17.960 --> 30:19.400
 and we talked about habitual

30:19.400 --> 30:21.820
 and impulsive behavior circuitry.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.880
 There are also dramatic changes in the activity of neurons

30:25.880 --> 30:28.040
 that control the release of so-called serotonin.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.060
 Serotonin is a neuromodulator.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.840
 It changes the activity of neural circuits

30:32.840 --> 30:34.000
 and many neural circuits,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
 in particular, those involved in mood

30:36.000 --> 30:37.460
 and feelings of wellbeing.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.980
 Recently, there's been a lot of interest in serotonin

30:39.980 --> 30:41.280
 because of a study that was released

30:41.280 --> 30:42.840
 that showed pretty conclusively

30:42.840 --> 30:46.680
 that serotonin levels can't really explain depression

30:46.680 --> 30:48.280
 and depression-like symptoms.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.440
 I want to make it very clear

30:49.440 --> 30:53.120
 that although that study did show that serotonin levels

30:53.120 --> 30:56.340
 are not necessarily associated with depression,

30:56.340 --> 30:58.560
 the study was interpreted by many to mean

30:58.560 --> 31:01.520
 that SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

31:01.520 --> 31:04.520
 which have the net effect of increasing serotonin,

31:04.520 --> 31:07.200
 these are things like Prozac, et cetera,

31:07.200 --> 31:10.440
 that those drugs are somehow not helpful

31:10.440 --> 31:13.060
 because they increase serotonin

31:13.060 --> 31:15.960
 and serotonin isn't involved in depression.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.320
 That logic doesn't really hold together,

31:18.320 --> 31:19.720
 so I'm going to use this as an opportunity

31:19.720 --> 31:22.360
 to just clarify what really occurred there,

31:22.360 --> 31:24.000
 and then we'll talk about how serotonin

31:24.000 --> 31:25.280
 relates to alcohol consumption

31:25.280 --> 31:29.120
 in things like feeling good and in depression.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.600
 The key thing is this,

31:30.600 --> 31:34.860
 SSRIs can help alleviate depression.

31:34.860 --> 31:37.840
 That's right, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.080
 They are often not always associated with side effects,

31:40.080 --> 31:42.320
 dosage is very important, et cetera,

31:42.320 --> 31:47.120
 but they probably support relief from depression

31:47.120 --> 31:48.840
 by changing neural circuits,

31:48.840 --> 31:52.080
 not necessarily by increasing serotonin itself.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.440
 That is, increasing serotonin with these drugs

31:54.440 --> 31:57.480
 likely change the neural circuits involved in mood,

31:57.480 --> 31:58.820
 allowing people to feel better

31:58.820 --> 32:00.400
 through so-called neuroplasticity,

32:00.400 --> 32:02.540
 which is the brain's ability to change itself

32:02.540 --> 32:03.860
 in response to experience.

32:03.860 --> 32:04.900
 So there's a bit of confusion,

32:04.900 --> 32:07.800
 and again, I'm using this episode on alcohol

32:07.800 --> 32:08.980
 to highlight some of the confusion

32:08.980 --> 32:10.320
 because I think it's timely,

32:10.320 --> 32:11.240
 because the study just came out

32:11.240 --> 32:13.260
 and there's a lot of chatter about this out there,

32:13.260 --> 32:15.680
 that when people are depressed,

32:15.680 --> 32:18.820
 it's not necessarily because serotonin levels are low.

32:18.820 --> 32:21.160
 However, if serotonin levels are increased

32:21.160 --> 32:24.080
 with things like Prozac, Zoloft, and other SSRIs,

32:24.080 --> 32:27.800
 oftentimes there is, yes, a relief from depression,

32:27.800 --> 32:29.240
 but that's probably not

32:29.240 --> 32:31.520
 because of restoring serotonin levels per se,

32:31.520 --> 32:33.920
 it's probably because serotonin

32:33.920 --> 32:36.820
 facilitates the changes in neural circuits

32:36.820 --> 32:38.440
 that need to occur in order for people

32:38.440 --> 32:40.320
 to feel elevated mood, okay?

32:40.320 --> 32:42.040
 So again, that's a bit of a tangent and aside,

32:42.040 --> 32:44.700
 but I do think it's a vital one for people to know about.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.540
 Again, if you're thinking about taking SSRIs,

32:46.540 --> 32:48.840
 you're currently taking them and you've heard this news,

32:48.840 --> 32:50.300
 definitely talk to your doctor.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.680
 Again, there is great utility for some of these SSRIs

32:52.680 --> 32:54.740
 and also in conditions like OCD,

32:54.740 --> 32:56.360
 they've been shown to be very beneficial,

32:56.360 --> 32:58.560
 so we really don't want to throw SSRIs out

32:58.560 --> 33:00.380
 as a potentially valuable treatment.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.000
 Getting back to the effects of alcohol on serotonin,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.560
 it's very clear beyond any doubt

33:08.560 --> 33:10.320
 that many of the circuits in the brain

33:10.320 --> 33:12.800
 that are involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing

33:12.800 --> 33:17.120
 and also sort of self-image in how we see ourselves

33:17.120 --> 33:21.040
 employ the neuromodulator serotonin and alcohol

33:21.040 --> 33:25.520
 when we ingest it and it's converted into acetaldehyde,

33:25.520 --> 33:29.640
 it goes and that acetaldehyde acts as a toxin

33:29.640 --> 33:31.080
 at the very synapses,

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
 the connections between the serotonergic neurons

33:33.080 --> 33:34.440
 and lots of other neurons.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.400
 In other words, when we ingest alcohol,

33:36.400 --> 33:40.220
 the toxic effects of alcohol disrupt those mood circuitries

33:40.220 --> 33:43.320
 at first making them hyperactive, that's right,

33:43.320 --> 33:44.240
 making them hyperactive,

33:44.240 --> 33:46.260
 this is why people become really talkative,

33:46.260 --> 33:47.360
 people start to feel really good

33:47.360 --> 33:50.120
 after a few sips of alcohol, at least most people do,

33:50.120 --> 33:53.080
 and then as they can ingest more alcohol

33:53.080 --> 33:54.920
 or as that alcohol wears off,

33:54.920 --> 33:57.600
 serotonin levels and the activity of those circuits

33:57.600 --> 34:00.920
 really starts to drop and that's why people feel less good

34:00.920 --> 34:03.360
 and typically what they do, they go and get another drink

34:03.360 --> 34:05.660
 and they attempt to kind of restore that feeling

34:05.660 --> 34:06.860
 of wellbeing and mood.

34:06.860 --> 34:09.260
 Now, typically what happens is that as people ingest

34:09.260 --> 34:12.920
 the third and fourth, maybe even the fifth drink,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.980
 there's an absolute zero chance of them recovering

34:15.980 --> 34:17.680
 that energized mood, right?

34:17.680 --> 34:19.560
 Most people as they drink more and more

34:19.560 --> 34:23.280
 will now start to feel more and more suppressed.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.520
 The forebrain is now shutting down quite a lot,

34:25.520 --> 34:27.460
 a lot of the motor cortical areas

34:27.460 --> 34:29.560
 that control coordinated movement

34:29.560 --> 34:31.000
 and deliberate movement start to shut down

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
 so people start to slur their speech,

34:33.000 --> 34:34.740
 people start to shuffle their feet,

34:34.740 --> 34:36.660
 people forget their posture,

34:36.660 --> 34:38.020
 people start to lean on things,

34:38.020 --> 34:40.140
 people start passing out on couches,

34:40.140 --> 34:41.640
 there's a great depression,

34:41.640 --> 34:44.960
 not depression of the psychiatric depression sort,

34:44.960 --> 34:49.960
 but a depression of alertness and arousal

34:50.480 --> 34:53.000
 and eventually people will pass out.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.820
 Now, I said most people because there's a subset of people

34:55.820 --> 35:00.240
 that have gene variants or who are chronic drinkers

35:00.240 --> 35:03.480
 or who are chronic drinkers and have gene variants

35:03.480 --> 35:07.680
 that as they ingest the third and fourth and fifth drink,

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
 what happens?

35:08.680 --> 35:11.060
 They become more alert, they start talking more,

35:11.060 --> 35:12.800
 they feel great, they have all sorts of ideas

35:12.800 --> 35:14.260
 about the fun they could have that night

35:14.260 --> 35:17.200
 and they're the ones that if you've ever fallen asleep

35:17.200 --> 35:19.320
 at a party for whatever reason or you're getting tired

35:19.320 --> 35:20.600
 and you're yawning, you're looking around the room

35:20.600 --> 35:22.520
 and like these people are still drinking and partying

35:22.520 --> 35:25.280
 and they're having what seems to be this amazing time,

35:26.280 --> 35:30.480
 often not always, those are the future alcoholics

35:30.480 --> 35:32.440
 in the room or those are the people

35:32.440 --> 35:35.560
 that have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism

35:35.560 --> 35:37.080
 or those are the chronic drinkers,

35:37.080 --> 35:39.840
 the people who have built up enough of a tolerance

35:39.840 --> 35:42.500
 or who have the chemical genetic makeup

35:42.500 --> 35:44.960
 such that increasing amounts of alcohol

35:44.960 --> 35:46.800
 make them feel better and better and better

35:46.800 --> 35:49.120
 and of course, they too have a threshold

35:49.120 --> 35:50.680
 beyond which their nervous system

35:50.680 --> 35:53.160
 will start to get diminished and they'll pass out

35:53.160 --> 35:55.340
 and fall over, et cetera,

35:55.340 --> 35:57.700
 but that threshold is way, way higher

35:57.700 --> 35:59.680
 than it is for most people.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.860
 Now, this is important to understand

36:01.860 --> 36:03.480
 and it's important to understand

36:03.480 --> 36:05.280
 because I think everyone should know

36:05.280 --> 36:07.580
 and recognize their own predisposition

36:07.580 --> 36:11.640
 and kind of risk in terms of developing alcoholism.

36:11.640 --> 36:12.840
 It's also important to understand

36:12.840 --> 36:15.440
 because it relates to the phenomenon of blackout.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.120
 Many people think that blacking out is passing out,

36:18.120 --> 36:21.320
 but blackout drunk is when people drink

36:21.320 --> 36:22.720
 and they're talking and doing things,

36:22.720 --> 36:27.000
 sometimes sadly or tragically, they'll often drive home

36:27.000 --> 36:29.240
 or walk home or they'll hop on a bicycle and ride home

36:29.240 --> 36:30.360
 or they'll go swimming in the ocean,

36:30.360 --> 36:32.880
 all of course, very dangerous activities

36:32.880 --> 36:35.840
 to do when people are really drunk or even a little bit drunk

36:35.840 --> 36:36.680
 in some cases.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.960
 So these people will do these sorts of things

36:38.960 --> 36:41.640
 and they do them because they have the energy to do them

36:41.640 --> 36:43.680
 and they feel good while doing them,

36:43.680 --> 36:46.240
 but they are doing them while the activity of neurons

36:46.240 --> 36:48.880
 in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation

36:48.880 --> 36:52.560
 are completely shut off and this is why the next day

36:52.560 --> 36:54.920
 you tell them, hey, maybe we should talk about

36:54.920 --> 36:57.360
 what happened last night, like what happened last night?

36:57.360 --> 36:58.840
 He said, well, do you remember going to the party?

36:58.840 --> 37:00.500
 Yeah, no, it was great, we did this, we did this

37:00.500 --> 37:04.140
 and then what, and it's very clear all of a sudden

37:04.140 --> 37:06.720
 that they have no recollection of all the things

37:06.720 --> 37:08.960
 they were doing despite being awake.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.580
 Now, I wish I could tell you that there's some sort

37:10.580 --> 37:13.560
 of blood test or other biomarker, even a fingerprint test

37:13.560 --> 37:15.840
 that would allow you to determine whether or not

37:15.840 --> 37:18.940
 you have a propensity to be one of these drinkers

37:18.940 --> 37:22.400
 that has a predisposition for alcoholism

37:22.400 --> 37:24.440
 and if you've ever been blackout drunk

37:24.440 --> 37:26.280
 and certainly if you've been blackout drunk

37:26.280 --> 37:29.240
 more than a few times, you should be quite concerned

37:29.240 --> 37:32.120
 and as we talk more about the more chronic effects

37:32.120 --> 37:34.880
 and long lasting effects of alcohol consumption

37:34.880 --> 37:36.600
 a little bit later in the episode,

37:36.600 --> 37:37.520
 I think it will become clear

37:37.520 --> 37:39.240
 as to why you should be concerned.

37:39.240 --> 37:43.440
 But in any case, there is something that can tell you

37:43.440 --> 37:46.240
 whether or not you might be in that category

37:46.240 --> 37:48.040
 versus likely not in that category

37:48.040 --> 37:49.740
 and I alluded to this a couple of times already

37:49.740 --> 37:54.600
 but I want to be really clear that when people drink,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.380
 no matter who you are, initially there's that shutting down

37:57.380 --> 37:59.400
 of those prefrontal cortical circuits,

37:59.400 --> 38:01.160
 there's a gradual shutting down of the circuits

38:01.160 --> 38:03.680
 that control memory but then people divide

38:03.680 --> 38:06.680
 into these two bins and these two bins are the people

38:06.680 --> 38:11.060
 who after more than a couple of drinks start to feel sedated

38:11.060 --> 38:13.200
 and the people who after more than a few drinks

38:13.200 --> 38:15.520
 do not start to feel sedated.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.920
 Now, of course, there's going to be differences

38:17.920 --> 38:20.240
 created by how quickly people are drinking,

38:20.240 --> 38:23.120
 whether or not they're combining different types of alcohol,

38:23.120 --> 38:26.020
 the types of alcohol, et cetera, but in general,

38:26.020 --> 38:27.680
 that can predict whether or not you're somebody

38:27.680 --> 38:30.240
 who has a predisposition for alcoholism or not.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.600
 One also very interesting finding

38:33.600 --> 38:36.820
 is that alcohol changes the relationship

38:36.820 --> 38:39.260
 between what's called the hypothalamus

38:39.260 --> 38:41.880
 and the pituitary gland and the adrenals.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.120
 Now, the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons

38:44.120 --> 38:45.720
 about the size of a large gumball

38:45.720 --> 38:47.080
 sits above the roof of your mouth

38:47.080 --> 38:48.920
 and it houses neurons that are responsible

38:48.920 --> 38:53.080
 for some incredible aspects of our behavior and our mindset,

38:53.080 --> 38:56.340
 things like rage, things like sex drive,

38:56.340 --> 38:57.980
 things like temperature regulation,

38:57.980 --> 39:00.040
 very primitive functions,

39:00.040 --> 39:02.560
 including appetite, thirst, et cetera.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.840
 Alcohol, because it can go anywhere in the brain,

39:04.840 --> 39:07.040
 remember it's water and fat soluble,

39:07.040 --> 39:09.280
 has effects on the hypothalamus.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.640
 The hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals

39:13.640 --> 39:15.160
 to what's called the pituitary gland.

39:15.160 --> 39:18.240
 This is a little gland that actually sticks out of the brain

39:18.240 --> 39:22.160
 but it receives instructions from the hypothalamus

39:22.160 --> 39:24.340
 and then the pituitary releases hormones

39:24.340 --> 39:26.740
 into the bloodstream that go and talk to your adrenals,

39:26.740 --> 39:29.600
 your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys

39:29.600 --> 39:30.880
 in your lower back

39:30.880 --> 39:33.760
 and the adrenals release, as the name suggests,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.300
 adrenaline, also called epinephrine,

39:35.300 --> 39:37.720
 and also a molecule called cortisol,

39:37.720 --> 39:40.640
 which is involved in the kind of longer-term stress response

39:40.640 --> 39:42.560
 has some healthy effects too on the immune system.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.620
 Okay, so the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,

39:46.480 --> 39:47.640
 I know that's a mouthful,

39:47.640 --> 39:49.120
 you don't need to remember the names,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.560
 but the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

39:51.560 --> 39:53.560
 maintains your physiological balance

39:53.560 --> 39:55.160
 of what you perceive as stressful

39:55.160 --> 39:57.160
 and what you don't perceive as stressful.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.120
 People who drink regularly,

40:00.120 --> 40:02.740
 so this again could be just one or two drinks per night,

40:02.740 --> 40:05.280
 or it could be somebody that drinks just on Fridays

40:05.280 --> 40:07.720
 or just on Saturdays, or maybe just on the weekend,

40:07.720 --> 40:09.020
 two to four drinks,

40:09.020 --> 40:10.740
 well, those people experience changes

40:10.740 --> 40:14.000
 in their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

40:14.000 --> 40:15.880
 that result in more cortisol,

40:15.880 --> 40:17.920
 more of this so-called stress hormone

40:17.920 --> 40:21.600
 being released at baseline when they are not drinking.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.840
 This is really important.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.000
 People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit,

40:26.000 --> 40:27.200
 I don't mean one or two sips

40:27.200 --> 40:29.720
 or even a glass of wine every once in a while.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.680
 I mean, again, people that are maybe having

40:32.680 --> 40:34.520
 one drink a night with dinner

40:34.520 --> 40:36.800
 and maybe on the weekend a few more.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.360
 Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns

40:38.360 --> 40:41.120
 to explain how it could also be

40:41.120 --> 40:42.600
 two or three drinks on Friday

40:42.600 --> 40:44.720
 or six drinks only on Saturday.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.200
 Well, all of those groups experience increases

40:47.200 --> 40:51.120
 in cortisol release from their adrenal glands

40:51.120 --> 40:52.440
 when they are not drinking.

40:52.440 --> 40:56.240
 And as a consequence, they feel more stressed

40:56.240 --> 40:59.560
 and more anxiety when they aren't drinking.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.080
 This is a seldom-talked-about effect of alcohol

41:03.080 --> 41:04.520
 because so often we hear about

41:04.520 --> 41:06.320
 the immediate effects of alcohol, right?

41:06.320 --> 41:08.200
 And we've been talking about some of those effects,

41:08.200 --> 41:10.420
 effects like reducing the amount of stress.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.640
 I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say,

41:12.640 --> 41:14.400
 oh, I need a drink, and then they have a drink,

41:14.400 --> 41:15.600
 and they're like, calm down.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.640
 Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.000
 They can start to think about things

41:20.000 --> 41:22.260
 in a maybe more grounded or rational way,

41:22.260 --> 41:23.400
 or at least they believe that,

41:23.400 --> 41:26.240
 or they can somehow just relax themselves.

41:26.240 --> 41:29.020
 Well, while that very well may be true,

41:29.020 --> 41:32.280
 that it can relax them, when they are not drinking,

41:32.280 --> 41:34.960
 that level of cortisol that's released at baseline

41:34.960 --> 41:37.180
 has increased substantially.

41:37.180 --> 41:40.600
 Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit

41:40.600 --> 41:41.680
 between brain and body,

41:41.680 --> 41:44.220
 and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol

41:44.220 --> 41:45.880
 to some of the other hormones

41:45.880 --> 41:48.000
 involved in the stress response.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.520
 We'll provide a reference to the study

41:49.520 --> 41:51.200
 that describes how all of this works

41:51.200 --> 41:53.200
 for those of you that really want to delve into it.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.480
 But let's go back to this issue

41:55.480 --> 41:57.500
 of those who are prone to alcoholism

41:57.500 --> 41:59.000
 versus those who are not.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.360
 Remember, there are people who have genetic variants,

42:02.360 --> 42:05.780
 that meaning genes that they inherited from their parents,

42:05.780 --> 42:08.900
 that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics,

42:08.900 --> 42:12.040
 but there are also people who drink often,

42:12.040 --> 42:14.900
 who start to experience this increase in alertness

42:14.900 --> 42:17.720
 the longer they drink across the night.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.880
 Part of that effect, we think,

42:19.880 --> 42:21.200
 is because of changes

42:21.200 --> 42:23.940
 in this hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

42:23.940 --> 42:27.440
 So alcohol is kind of a double hit in this sense.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.280
 It's causing changes in our brain circuitry

42:29.280 --> 42:31.440
 and neurochemistry that,

42:31.440 --> 42:34.940
 at the time in which we're inebriated, are detrimental,

42:34.940 --> 42:37.120
 and it's causing changes in neural circuitry

42:37.120 --> 42:38.920
 that persist long past the time

42:38.920 --> 42:40.640
 in which we're experiencing the feeling

42:40.640 --> 42:42.720
 of being tipsy or drunk.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.000
 Now, again, I don't want to demonize alcohol.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.100
 I'm not saying, oh, you know,

42:46.100 --> 42:47.680
 if you have a glass of wine now and again,

42:47.680 --> 42:48.860
 or you drink a beer now and again,

42:48.860 --> 42:53.300
 or even have, you know, a mixed drink now and again,

42:53.300 --> 42:55.900
 or a shot, that that's necessarily terrible for you.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.620
 I certainly do not want that to be the message.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.120
 What I'm saying is that

43:01.120 --> 43:03.320
 if people are ingesting alcohol chronically,

43:03.320 --> 43:05.140
 even if it's not every night,

43:05.140 --> 43:10.080
 there are well-recognized changes in neural circuits.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.840
 There are well-recognized changes in neurochemistry

43:12.840 --> 43:13.920
 within the brain,

43:13.920 --> 43:16.140
 and there are well-recognized changes

43:16.140 --> 43:19.560
 in the brain-to-body stress system

43:19.560 --> 43:23.100
 that generally point in three directions,

43:23.980 --> 43:26.280
 increased stress when people are not drinking,

43:27.880 --> 43:30.240
 diminished mood and feelings of wellbeing

43:30.240 --> 43:32.280
 when people are not drinking,

43:32.280 --> 43:35.280
 and, as you'll soon learn,

43:35.280 --> 43:37.440
 changes in the neural circuitry

43:37.440 --> 43:41.100
 that cause people to want to drink even more

43:41.100 --> 43:43.820
 in order to get just back to baseline

43:43.820 --> 43:45.240
 or the place that they were

43:45.240 --> 43:46.980
 in terms of their stress modulation

43:46.980 --> 43:48.220
 and in terms of their feelings of mood

43:48.220 --> 43:51.420
 before they ever started drinking in the first place.

43:51.420 --> 43:54.140
 So again, I don't want to demonize alcohol,

43:54.140 --> 43:55.840
 but I do want to emphasize

43:55.840 --> 43:58.280
 that there are long-term plastic changes,

43:58.280 --> 44:01.100
 meaning changes in neural circuitry and hormone circuitry,

44:01.100 --> 44:03.780
 that across a period of several months

44:03.780 --> 44:05.380
 and certainly across a period of years

44:05.380 --> 44:07.500
 of the sorts of drinking patterns I described,

44:07.500 --> 44:09.180
 which I think for most people

44:09.180 --> 44:11.200
 are going to sound like pretty typical, right?

44:11.200 --> 44:12.800
 I mean, nothing that I described so far

44:12.800 --> 44:14.320
 was about drinking a case a night

44:14.320 --> 44:16.440
 or about binging on alcohol

44:16.440 --> 44:18.560
 in the way that we often hear about it in the news.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.680
 These are pretty common patterns of alcohol consumption.

44:21.680 --> 44:24.800
 I mean, all you have to do is board a transatlantic flight

44:24.800 --> 44:27.180
 or actually go to an airport on a Sunday afternoon

44:27.180 --> 44:28.480
 in a sunny area of the US,

44:28.480 --> 44:32.640
 and people are having three, four, five, six beers, et cetera.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.860
 Again, personal choice is personal choice.

44:34.860 --> 44:36.040
 I'm not telling you what to do,

44:36.040 --> 44:38.700
 but it's very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns

44:38.700 --> 44:40.180
 are changing neural circuitry

44:40.180 --> 44:42.120
 and they're changing hormone circuitry,

44:42.120 --> 44:43.100
 and I'd love to be able to tell you

44:43.100 --> 44:44.320
 that they're changing them for the better,

44:44.320 --> 44:46.080
 but they simply are not.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.560
 They're actually changing them for the worse,

44:47.560 --> 44:49.680
 and worse is defined as making people less resilient

44:49.680 --> 44:52.200
 to stress, higher levels of baseline stress,

44:52.200 --> 44:53.800
 and lower mood overall.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.600
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

44:55.600 --> 44:58.120
 I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,

44:58.120 --> 45:01.320
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.600
 Athletic Greens, aka AG1,

45:03.600 --> 45:06.040
 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink

45:06.040 --> 45:09.120
 that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.840
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,

45:11.840 --> 45:14.240
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.880
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

45:15.880 --> 45:18.800
 and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day

45:18.800 --> 45:21.720
 is that it supplies total foundational coverage

45:21.720 --> 45:23.120
 of my vitamin mineral needs,

45:23.120 --> 45:26.040
 and it supplies important nutrients that I need

45:26.040 --> 45:27.600
 to support my gut microbiome.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.340
 The gut microbiome, as many of you know,

45:29.340 --> 45:30.440
 supports the immune system.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.480
 It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,

45:32.480 --> 45:34.840
 which is vital for mood, for energy levels,

45:34.840 --> 45:36.120
 for regulating focus,

45:36.120 --> 45:37.940
 and many other features of our mental health

45:37.940 --> 45:40.260
 and physical health that impact our daily performance

45:40.260 --> 45:41.900
 and high performance in any endeavors

45:41.900 --> 45:43.280
 we might be involved in.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.680
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

45:44.680 --> 45:47.360
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

45:47.360 --> 45:48.960
 and claim a special offer.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.620
 They're giving away five free travel packs

45:50.620 --> 45:54.520
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.

45:54.520 --> 45:56.720
 And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital

45:56.720 --> 45:58.800
 for all sorts of things like hormone health

45:58.800 --> 46:01.240
 and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health

46:01.240 --> 46:02.400
 and calcium regulation.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.640
 Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

46:05.640 --> 46:07.120
 to claim that special offer.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.160
 Now I've been talking a little bit

46:08.160 --> 46:10.600
 about genetic predisposition,

46:10.600 --> 46:12.220
 but there are a couple of important points

46:12.220 --> 46:13.520
 I'd like to make about that.

46:13.520 --> 46:16.280
 First of all, what sorts of genes are involved

46:16.280 --> 46:20.560
 in setting someone down the path of alcoholism or not?

46:20.560 --> 46:22.460
 Well, it should come as no surprise

46:22.460 --> 46:27.400
 that the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies,

46:27.400 --> 46:31.000
 they tend to fall primarily in the pathways

46:31.000 --> 46:35.280
 related to genetic control over serotonin receptors,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.760
 GABA receptors, remember that top-down inhibition

46:37.760 --> 46:38.960
 and the involvement of GABA,

46:38.960 --> 46:43.760
 and no surprise, the HPA, the hypothalamic pituitary axis.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.320
 All of those, of course, combined with environment,

46:46.320 --> 46:48.800
 they combine with patterns of abuse, right?

46:48.800 --> 46:50.240
 We know that if you're in a social setting

46:50.240 --> 46:51.460
 where a lot of people are drinking,

46:51.460 --> 46:54.400
 the likelihood that you're going to drink is much higher.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.740
 Social pressures, trauma, right?

46:57.740 --> 46:59.880
 Some people will use alcohol to self-medicate

46:59.880 --> 47:01.240
 to try and turn off their thinking

47:01.240 --> 47:03.440
 or to deal with trauma, et cetera.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.180
 So they combine with the environment,

47:05.180 --> 47:08.520
 but the genes that are in the serotonin synthesis

47:08.520 --> 47:12.480
 and receptor synthesis pathway, GABA and HPA axis,

47:12.480 --> 47:14.720
 combined with environmental pressures

47:14.720 --> 47:18.200
 to give rise to alcohol use disorders.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.120
 So there's a fairly coherent picture that we have here,

47:21.120 --> 47:21.960
 right?

47:21.960 --> 47:24.120
 This is not a case where, for instance,

47:24.120 --> 47:27.060
 people that have a lot of the enzyme for metabolizing alcohol

47:27.060 --> 47:28.080
 which we'll talk about in a minute,

47:28.080 --> 47:30.000
 alcohol dehydrogenase,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.160
 it's not like they are necessarily

47:32.160 --> 47:33.420
 the people that become alcoholics.

47:33.420 --> 47:35.600
 Whereas certainly in certain cultures,

47:35.600 --> 47:37.840
 certain Asian cultures in particular,

47:37.840 --> 47:40.720
 there are gene differences that lead them

47:40.720 --> 47:42.640
 to have low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.

47:42.640 --> 47:43.480
 There are actually people who have

47:43.480 --> 47:45.160
 so little alcohol dehydrogenase

47:45.160 --> 47:46.600
 that when they ingest alcohol,

47:46.600 --> 47:48.560
 they get very red and they just feel sick.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.080
 So if you're somebody that has a sip of alcohol

47:50.080 --> 47:52.320
 and you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous,

47:52.320 --> 47:56.120
 chances are you have gene variants that create a situation

47:56.120 --> 47:59.000
 where you're not making very much alcohol dehydrogenase,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.080
 you just simply can't metabolize alcohol,

48:01.080 --> 48:02.600
 so you just get a rapid buildup

48:02.600 --> 48:05.640
 of the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetaldehyde,

48:05.640 --> 48:08.400
 you're not converting it into those empty calories.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.600
 But in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants

48:12.600 --> 48:14.480
 and genes expressed in people

48:14.480 --> 48:16.580
 where they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase,

48:16.580 --> 48:18.400
 sure, they can drink more

48:18.400 --> 48:20.160
 and they're converting more of that alcohol

48:20.160 --> 48:23.080
 from its toxic form to a non-toxic form.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.960
 And yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism

48:25.960 --> 48:28.520
 in those communities because they're drinking more,

48:28.520 --> 48:31.560
 but I do want to emphasize that the environmental factors

48:31.560 --> 48:32.960
 are playing a strong role there too,

48:32.960 --> 48:35.360
 because if you can drink more, you're likely to drink more.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.860
 If you're somebody that feels sick immediately from drinking,

48:37.860 --> 48:39.180
 it's likely that you're not going to engage

48:39.180 --> 48:40.680
 in alcohol consumption,

48:40.680 --> 48:42.960
 especially if these things are genetically related

48:42.960 --> 48:45.520
 and of course, genes and culture and location in the world

48:45.520 --> 48:47.040
 tend to run together.

48:47.040 --> 48:50.920
 So do you have the gene for alcoholism?

48:50.920 --> 48:53.040
 Well, there isn't one single gene.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.880
 Chances are if you have an immediate relative

48:55.880 --> 48:58.140
 who's a chronic abuser of alcohol

48:58.140 --> 49:01.500
 or several relatives who are chronic abusers of alcohol,

49:01.500 --> 49:05.140
 well, that's going to predispose you to be an alcoholic.

49:05.140 --> 49:07.360
 But since you don't know which genes you express

49:07.360 --> 49:09.920
 unless you do genetic testing and those things are available

49:09.920 --> 49:11.800
 but most people aren't doing that,

49:11.800 --> 49:15.100
 this assay, if you will, and it's not an assay,

49:15.100 --> 49:17.920
 as we say, an assay is a test that you run in the lab

49:17.920 --> 49:19.420
 to determine something.

49:19.420 --> 49:20.720
 And it's not one that I recommend

49:20.720 --> 49:22.400
 that you go drink in order to do.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.720
 But if you've noticed that you or somebody else

49:24.720 --> 49:26.640
 is somebody who can drink a lot throughout the night

49:26.640 --> 49:27.640
 and have increased energy

49:27.640 --> 49:29.900
 and can just drink and drink a drink,

49:29.900 --> 49:32.280
 and especially if there's blackout episodes,

49:32.280 --> 49:33.600
 not remembering things the next day

49:33.600 --> 49:36.560
 despite being alert throughout the entire night and so on,

49:36.560 --> 49:38.520
 well, then I would be very concerned

49:38.520 --> 49:40.280
 that you might actually have a genetic variant

49:40.280 --> 49:42.020
 predisposing you to alcoholism.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.760
 The other thing that predisposes people

49:43.760 --> 49:47.360
 to abuse of alcohol is age.

49:47.360 --> 49:51.040
 People who start drinking at younger ages

49:51.040 --> 49:55.760
 are greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence

49:55.760 --> 49:58.640
 regardless of your family history of alcoholism, okay?

49:58.640 --> 49:59.640
 So I'm going to repeat that.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.640
 People who start drinking younger

50:01.640 --> 50:04.600
 are at great risk for developing alcoholism

50:04.600 --> 50:06.880
 even if they don't have alcoholism in their family.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.560
 Now, of course, you don't have to be an epidemiologist

50:09.560 --> 50:12.320
 to understand that if you grew up in a family of drinkers

50:12.320 --> 50:13.840
 and alcohol is everywhere,

50:13.840 --> 50:15.160
 and especially if there's peer pressure

50:15.160 --> 50:16.760
 or lack of oversight,

50:16.760 --> 50:19.240
 then there's going to be a higher tendency

50:19.240 --> 50:21.080
 or a higher probability, I should say,

50:21.080 --> 50:23.160
 that you will start drinking at a younger age.

50:23.160 --> 50:25.840
 However, even people that grow up

50:25.840 --> 50:27.660
 nowhere near their relatives,

50:27.660 --> 50:29.540
 if they start drinking at a young age,

50:29.540 --> 50:33.360
 so for instance, at 13 or younger or 14 or 15,

50:33.360 --> 50:34.640
 there's a much higher probability

50:34.640 --> 50:36.040
 that they're going to develop

50:36.040 --> 50:38.920
 a long-lasting dependence on alcohol.

50:38.920 --> 50:41.760
 People who take their first sip of alcohol later,

50:42.660 --> 50:44.800
 15, 16, or one would hope even later,

50:44.800 --> 50:45.720
 I can say one would hope

50:45.720 --> 50:47.840
 because I'm now of that age and generation

50:47.840 --> 50:51.260
 where you think about all the things that young people do

50:51.260 --> 50:53.120
 and you go, oh gosh, if they only would wait

50:53.120 --> 50:55.160
 or if they only would abstain,

50:55.160 --> 50:56.000
 it's just what happens.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.280
 I don't know, there's some neural circuit for that

50:57.280 --> 50:58.560
 that I can't explain yet.

50:58.560 --> 51:00.680
 But people who, for instance,

51:00.680 --> 51:03.240
 drink only once they reach legal age of drinking,

51:03.240 --> 51:06.740
 which in the US, I believe in every state is 21 years old,

51:06.740 --> 51:08.600
 if they take their first drink at 21,

51:08.600 --> 51:10.040
 the probability that they'll go on

51:10.040 --> 51:12.240
 to develop full-blown alcohol dependence

51:12.240 --> 51:15.680
 or alcohol use disorder as it's called, AUD, is very low.

51:15.680 --> 51:16.760
 Now, a subset of them will

51:16.760 --> 51:19.240
 because they have such a strong genetic predisposition

51:19.240 --> 51:22.500
 or maybe life circumstances create a pattern

51:22.500 --> 51:24.460
 in which they become a chronic drinker.

51:24.460 --> 51:26.240
 But I found this very interesting.

51:26.240 --> 51:29.160
 Genes matter, but also the age

51:29.160 --> 51:32.240
 in which somebody starts drinking really matters.

51:32.240 --> 51:34.160
 Now, whether or not that's because there are changes

51:34.160 --> 51:37.040
 in neural circuitry as a consequence of that drinking

51:37.040 --> 51:40.120
 that make people want to seek out more and more alcohol,

51:40.120 --> 51:42.220
 or whether or not there's some other effect,

51:42.220 --> 51:44.460
 maybe it's a change in hormones, et cetera,

51:44.460 --> 51:47.280
 that predisposes those young drinkers to become

51:47.280 --> 51:49.560
 chronic drinkers or even full-blown alcoholics,

51:49.560 --> 51:51.920
 certainly developing alcohol use disorder.

51:51.920 --> 51:52.880
 There's definition for that.

51:52.880 --> 51:53.700
 We can talk about it.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.520
 It involves the amount of drinking

51:55.520 --> 51:57.860
 over a certain period of time, et cetera.

51:57.860 --> 52:00.460
 So it's very clear that drinking early in life

52:00.460 --> 52:03.240
 creates a propensity for the development

52:03.240 --> 52:06.460
 of alcohol use disorder later in life.

52:06.460 --> 52:09.000
 And while there is a genetic component

52:09.000 --> 52:10.760
 to developing alcohol use disorder,

52:11.840 --> 52:14.120
 I find it very interesting that if people

52:14.120 --> 52:18.440
 who have those gene variants delay their onset of drinking,

52:18.440 --> 52:20.080
 well, then the probability that they'll develop

52:20.080 --> 52:23.080
 full-blown alcohol use disorder drops as well.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.860
 So again, it's genes and environments,

52:24.860 --> 52:28.120
 not an either or, and there's no single gene for alcoholism.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.240
 Well, I promise you, I will also talk about

52:30.240 --> 52:33.600
 some of the documented positive effects of alcohol.

52:33.600 --> 52:37.440
 Although they are very few and far between, they do exist.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.640
 But before I do that, I would be remiss

52:39.640 --> 52:42.680
 if I didn't emphasize some more of the terrible things

52:42.680 --> 52:45.300
 that alcohol does and the way that it does it.

52:45.300 --> 52:48.080
 And for those of you that enjoy alcohol,

52:48.080 --> 52:51.680
 I, again, I really, I like to say I feel guilty

52:51.680 --> 52:53.240
 about telling you this because I know

52:53.240 --> 52:55.040
 how much some people enjoy a good drink

52:55.040 --> 52:56.520
 every once in a while, and I say a good drink

52:56.520 --> 52:59.200
 because some people do like the taste of alcohol.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.060
 I suppose I lucked out in that I don't really like

53:01.060 --> 53:03.120
 the taste of alcohol and that just puts me to sleep,

53:03.120 --> 53:04.720
 but I know that people do enjoy it.

53:04.720 --> 53:09.720
 And I do want to point out that there is zero evidence

53:09.720 --> 53:14.120
 that, you know, provided somebody is of drinking age,

53:14.120 --> 53:17.360
 or certainly not in the stage of brain development,

53:17.360 --> 53:20.880
 that having one drink or two drinks every now and again,

53:20.880 --> 53:23.920
 meaning every three or four weeks or once a month,

53:23.920 --> 53:27.520
 that is not going to cause major health concerns

53:27.520 --> 53:30.080
 or major health issues for most people.

53:30.080 --> 53:32.280
 I suppose if you have zero

53:32.280 --> 53:34.160
 or very little alcohol dehydrogenates,

53:34.160 --> 53:34.980
 it might make you feel sick,

53:34.980 --> 53:36.360
 but then you're probably not the kind of person

53:36.360 --> 53:38.280
 that's going to be drinking at all.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.080
 So again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,

53:41.080 --> 53:46.080
 I'm not trying to take them away from you by any means,

53:46.160 --> 53:48.400
 but you should know what drinking does

53:48.400 --> 53:50.160
 if you're consuming it in this kind

53:50.160 --> 53:52.680
 of typical chronic pattern, as we can now refer to it,

53:52.680 --> 53:54.920
 which is that one or two a night,

53:54.920 --> 53:58.660
 or a few stacked up on Friday

53:58.660 --> 54:00.360
 and maybe three or four on Saturday,

54:00.360 --> 54:03.400
 this kind of pattern of drinking, which is quite common.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.920
 And one of the more serious effects

54:04.920 --> 54:07.080
 that we should think about is the impact

54:07.080 --> 54:08.520
 on the so-called gut-brain axis,

54:08.520 --> 54:12.200
 or for sake of today's discussion, the gut-liver-brain axis.

54:12.200 --> 54:13.740
 I don't think the gut-liver-brain axis

54:13.740 --> 54:15.340
 has ever been discussed on this podcast.

54:15.340 --> 54:17.600
 Maybe any podcast, although the moment I say that,

54:17.600 --> 54:20.840
 I'm going to, you know, the gut-liver-brain axis,

54:20.840 --> 54:21.880
 people are going to come after me

54:21.880 --> 54:24.440
 with, I suppose, gut, liver, brain, and brains.

54:24.440 --> 54:29.200
 In any event, you have a brain, you have a gut.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.320
 That gut runs from your throat

54:31.320 --> 54:36.040
 down to the end of your intestine.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.000
 Your gut and your brain communicate

54:38.000 --> 54:41.340
 by way of nerve cells, neurons, and nerve connections,

54:41.340 --> 54:43.220
 the vagus nerve in particular,

54:43.220 --> 54:45.680
 and by way of chemical signaling.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.340
 Your gut also communicates by way of chemical signaling,

54:48.340 --> 54:49.180
 and believe it or not,

54:49.180 --> 54:52.380
 by way of neural signaling to your liver.

54:52.380 --> 54:53.820
 And as we talked about earlier,

54:53.820 --> 54:56.780
 the liver is the first site in which alcohol

54:56.780 --> 55:00.220
 is broken down and metabolized into its component parts.

55:01.500 --> 55:04.280
 The liver is also communicating with the brain

55:04.280 --> 55:06.900
 through chemical signaling and neural signaling.

55:06.900 --> 55:10.240
 So we have the gut-liver-brain axis.

55:10.240 --> 55:14.880
 And what you find is that people who ingest alcohol

55:14.880 --> 55:19.000
 at any amount are inducing a disruption

55:19.000 --> 55:21.060
 in the so-called gut microbiome,

55:21.060 --> 55:23.980
 the trillions of little micro-bacteria

55:23.980 --> 55:25.420
 that take resident in your gut

55:25.420 --> 55:26.820
 and that live inside you all the time

55:26.820 --> 55:28.300
 and that help support your immune system

55:28.300 --> 55:31.920
 and that literally signal by way of electrical signals

55:31.920 --> 55:33.940
 and chemical signals to your brain

55:33.940 --> 55:36.480
 to increase the release of things like serotonin

55:36.480 --> 55:38.100
 and dopamine and regulate your mood

55:38.100 --> 55:39.580
 generally in positive ways.

55:39.580 --> 55:41.980
 Well, alcohol really disrupts those bacteria.

55:41.980 --> 55:43.160
 And this should come as no surprise.

55:43.160 --> 55:45.240
 I mean, earlier we talked about this and it's well-known.

55:45.240 --> 55:47.260
 If you want to sterilize something,

55:47.260 --> 55:50.060
 you want to kill the bacteria, you pour alcohol on it.

55:50.060 --> 55:53.840
 And I can remember scraping myself or cutting myself.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.820
 I was always injuring myself when I was a kid.

55:55.820 --> 55:58.460
 And the moment they take out the peroxide,

55:58.460 --> 55:59.580
 you're like, oh boy, here it comes.

55:59.580 --> 56:01.340
 But if there's no peroxide around

56:01.340 --> 56:03.380
 and you've got a wound there and you need to clean it out,

56:03.380 --> 56:04.940
 yeah, they'll use alcohol,

56:04.940 --> 56:06.460
 which I do not recommend by the way.

56:06.460 --> 56:08.600
 That's one of the harshest ways to clean a wound.

56:08.600 --> 56:11.020
 But for centuries, thousands of years really,

56:11.020 --> 56:13.940
 alcohol has been used in order to clean things

56:13.940 --> 56:15.620
 and kill bacteria.

56:15.620 --> 56:19.700
 So alcohol kills bacteria and it is indiscriminate

56:19.700 --> 56:22.180
 with respect to which bacteria it kills.

56:22.180 --> 56:24.420
 So when we ingest alcohol and it goes into our gut,

56:24.420 --> 56:27.820
 it kills a lot of the healthy gut microbiota.

56:27.820 --> 56:30.940
 At the same time, the metabolism of alcohol in the liver,

56:30.940 --> 56:33.900
 which you now understand that pathway involving NAD,

56:33.900 --> 56:38.900
 acetaldehyde and acetate, that pathway is pro-inflammatory.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.840
 So it's increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines,

56:43.840 --> 56:47.820
 things like IL-6, et cetera, tumor necrosis factor alpha.

56:47.820 --> 56:49.380
 If you'd like to learn more about the immune system,

56:49.380 --> 56:51.460
 we did an episode all about the immune system.

56:51.460 --> 56:52.940
 You can find it at hubermanlab.com.

56:52.940 --> 56:55.420
 It'll teach you all the basics of what are cytokines,

56:55.420 --> 56:57.500
 what are mast cells, et cetera.

56:57.500 --> 57:00.820
 In any event, all these pro-inflammatory molecules,

57:02.080 --> 57:03.920
 those are being released.

57:03.920 --> 57:07.340
 You've now got disruption of the gut microbiota.

57:07.340 --> 57:10.500
 As a consequence, the lining of the gut is disrupted

57:10.500 --> 57:14.980
 and you develop at least transiently leaky gut.

57:14.980 --> 57:17.420
 That is bacteria that exists in the gut,

57:17.420 --> 57:18.700
 which are bad bacteria,

57:18.700 --> 57:20.780
 can now pass out of the gut into the bloodstream.

57:20.780 --> 57:23.020
 So you've got a two hit kind of model here.

57:23.020 --> 57:25.420
 In biology, we talk about two hit models

57:25.420 --> 57:27.900
 that it's kind of a one plus one equals four.

57:27.900 --> 57:29.300
 And it's generally when you hear two hit,

57:29.300 --> 57:30.700
 it's not a good thing.

57:30.700 --> 57:35.180
 So you've got bad bacteria from partially broken down food

57:35.180 --> 57:36.260
 moving out of the gut.

57:36.260 --> 57:38.340
 The good bacteria in the gut have been killed.

57:38.340 --> 57:39.740
 You might say, why doesn't the alcohol

57:39.740 --> 57:41.980
 kill the bad bacteria in the gut?

57:41.980 --> 57:46.980
 Well, the bad bacteria that are from partially digested food

57:47.060 --> 57:49.380
 oftentimes escape the gut

57:49.380 --> 57:52.420
 before the alcohol can disrupt them.

57:52.420 --> 57:55.380
 And so now you've got leaks in the gut wall.

57:55.380 --> 57:57.180
 You've got the release of this bad bacteria.

57:57.180 --> 57:59.260
 You've got inflammatory cytokines

57:59.260 --> 58:01.220
 and other things being released from the liver.

58:01.220 --> 58:03.780
 And they are able to get into the brain

58:03.780 --> 58:06.440
 through what's called a neuro-immune signaling.

58:06.440 --> 58:08.860
 And what's really bizarre in terms of the way

58:08.860 --> 58:10.740
 that this manifests in the brain.

58:10.740 --> 58:12.840
 I mean, it's not the way I would have done it.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.160
 But then again, as I always say,

58:14.160 --> 58:16.660
 I wasn't consulted at the design phase.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.680
 And anyone who says they did,

58:17.680 --> 58:19.540
 you should be very skeptical of them.

58:20.420 --> 58:24.020
 The net effect of this is actually to disrupt

58:24.020 --> 58:26.380
 the neural circuits that control regulation

58:26.380 --> 58:27.700
 of alcohol intake.

58:27.700 --> 58:32.340
 And the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.740
 So this is just terrible, right?

58:33.740 --> 58:35.980
 I mean, so you're taking in something

58:35.980 --> 58:38.780
 that disrupts two systems, the gut microbiota,

58:38.780 --> 58:39.820
 and it disrupts in two ways.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.900
 It's killing the good gut microbiota,

58:41.900 --> 58:45.820
 and it's allowing the bad bacteria

58:45.820 --> 58:47.480
 to move from the gut into the bloodstream.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.700
 You've also got pro-inflammatory cytokines

58:49.700 --> 58:51.020
 coming from the liver.

58:51.020 --> 58:55.060
 And those converge or arrive in the brain

58:55.060 --> 58:58.260
 and create a system in which the neural circuits

58:58.260 --> 59:00.120
 cause more drinking.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.460
 That's a bad situation.

59:01.460 --> 59:04.000
 And this is why people who drink regularly,

59:04.000 --> 59:05.900
 even if it's not a ton of alcohol,

59:06.760 --> 59:08.420
 again, of the sorts of patterns of drinking

59:08.420 --> 59:09.260
 I talked about before,

59:09.260 --> 59:12.560
 and certainly for those that are chronic heavy drinkers,

59:12.560 --> 59:14.300
 what you end up with is a situation

59:14.300 --> 59:15.940
 in which you have inflammation

59:15.940 --> 59:17.940
 in multiple places in the brain and body,

59:17.940 --> 59:20.300
 and the desire to drink even more

59:20.300 --> 59:22.300
 and to further exacerbate that inflammation

59:22.300 --> 59:24.100
 and the gut leakiness.

59:24.100 --> 59:26.240
 So this is basically a terrible scenario

59:26.240 --> 59:28.580
 for the gut-liver-brain axis.

59:28.580 --> 59:29.860
 And it's especially prevalent

59:29.860 --> 59:31.380
 in so-called alcohol use disorder.

59:31.380 --> 59:32.380
 Again, people that are ingesting

59:32.380 --> 59:34.920
 somewhere between 12 and 24 drinks per week.

59:34.920 --> 59:36.100
 For those of you that are interested

59:36.100 --> 59:38.180
 in learning more about the gut-liver-brain axis

59:38.180 --> 59:40.100
 and in particular alcohol use disorder,

59:40.100 --> 59:42.260
 I'll provide a link in the show note captions.

59:42.260 --> 59:45.540
 There's a wonderful review on this that details that.

59:45.540 --> 59:47.440
 But on the positive side,

59:47.440 --> 59:50.040
 it points to the possibility that at least some,

59:50.040 --> 59:52.600
 again, at least some of the negative effects

59:52.600 --> 59:53.640
 of alcohol consumption,

59:53.640 --> 59:54.740
 whether or not you're somebody

59:54.740 --> 59:56.980
 who's currently ingesting alcohol

59:56.980 --> 59:58.300
 or who used to ingest alcohol

59:58.300 --> 1:00:00.420
 and is trying to so-called repair these systems

1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:01.520
 of the brain and body,

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.940
 whether or not replenishing the gut microbiota

1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:04.840
 is going to be beneficial.

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:07.020
 And we know that there are ways to do that.

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:09.060
 And we know that there's at least some promise

1:00:09.060 --> 1:00:11.800
 for the ability for the system to repair itself.

1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:13.100
 How does one do that?

1:00:13.100 --> 1:00:15.220
 Well, I've talked before about this on the podcast,

1:00:15.220 --> 1:00:17.700
 but studies done by colleagues of mine at Stanford,

1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:20.040
 Justin Sonnenberg, who's been on this podcast as a guest,

1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:22.100
 an amazing episode all about the gut microbiome

1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:23.700
 and his collaborator, Chris Garner,

1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:25.820
 also at Stanford School of Medicine

1:00:25.820 --> 1:00:28.780
 have explored not alcoholism,

1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:32.860
 but what are ways to improve the gut microbiota

1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:34.660
 in particular to reduce

1:00:34.660 --> 1:00:38.460
 the production of inflammatory cytokines

1:00:38.460 --> 1:00:40.540
 and to adjust what's called the inflammatome.

1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:43.080
 You've heard of the genome and the proteome, et cetera.

1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:46.900
 Well, the inflammatome is the total array

1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:49.960
 or at least the near total array of genes and proteins

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:51.340
 that control inflammation.

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:52.740
 How can you reduce inflammation

1:00:52.740 --> 1:00:55.160
 and make that inflammatome healthier?

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:57.980
 Well, they've shown that two to four servings

1:00:57.980 --> 1:00:59.620
 of fermented foods per day,

1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:01.660
 and here I'm not referring to fermented alcohol,

1:01:01.660 --> 1:01:03.300
 I'm talking about low sugar fermented foods,

1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:06.560
 so things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:09.940
 for those of you that like Japanese food.

1:01:09.940 --> 1:01:12.300
 There are others, I know things like kefir,

1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:15.580
 things like yogurts that have a lot of active bacteria,

1:01:15.580 --> 1:01:18.120
 again, low sugar varieties of all these things.

1:01:19.020 --> 1:01:23.040
 Those are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers

1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.780
 and at improving the gut microbiome.

1:01:25.780 --> 1:01:28.960
 One could imagine that either inoculating oneself

1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:30.640
 from some of the effects of alcohol,

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:31.560
 although I'd prefer that people

1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:34.500
 just not drink alcohol chronically, frankly,

1:01:34.500 --> 1:01:37.140
 or if somebody is trying to repair their gut microbiome

1:01:37.140 --> 1:01:39.500
 because they ingested a lot of alcohol

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.620
 or because they had a lot of these inflammatory cytokines

1:01:41.620 --> 1:01:44.400
 for many years or even a short period of time,

1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:46.580
 regular ingestion of two to four servings

1:01:46.580 --> 1:01:49.840
 of these fermented foods can be quite beneficial.

1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:53.180
 I want to make it clear that has not been examined

1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:57.140
 specifically in the context of alcohol use disorder,

1:01:57.140 --> 1:02:00.620
 but because a huge component of the negative effects

1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.700
 of alcohol use disorder are based

1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:04.500
 in this gut-liver-brain axis and disruption

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:07.080
 of the gut microbiome and the inflammatory cytokines,

1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:10.220
 it stands to reason that things that are well-established

1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:12.920
 to improve inflammation status,

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.580
 in other words, reduce inflammation,

1:02:14.580 --> 1:02:16.220
 such as ingesting two to four servings

1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:18.160
 of low-sugar fermented foods per day,

1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:21.460
 makes sense in terms of trying to repair

1:02:21.460 --> 1:02:23.220
 or replenish the system.

1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:25.820
 One could also imagine taking probiotics or prebiotics.

1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:27.780
 Certainly that would work as well,

1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:29.780
 although I've sort of favored the discussion

1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:31.620
 around fermented foods and replenishment

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:32.940
 of the gut microbiome,

1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:35.860
 mostly because there are more studies

1:02:35.860 --> 1:02:37.540
 that have examined that in humans

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:39.500
 and because of the direct relationship

1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:41.140
 that's been established between doing that

1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:44.280
 and reducing negative markers within the inflammatome.

1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:47.160
 And I should mention along the lines of repair and recovery,

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:49.240
 I put out a question on Twitter the other day.

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:51.140
 I said, what do you want to know about alcohol?

1:02:51.140 --> 1:02:53.260
 I got more than a thousand questions,

1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:54.540
 and we'll take some more of those questions

1:02:54.540 --> 1:02:55.480
 a little later in the episode.

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:56.480
 But one of the things I noticed

1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:59.980
 is that many of the questions, hundreds in fact,

1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:02.460
 related to the question of,

1:03:02.460 --> 1:03:05.780
 well, if I drank a lot previously, am I doomed?

1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:07.400
 Can I reverse the negative effects?

1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:09.540
 Or, you know, I'm trying to drink less

1:03:09.540 --> 1:03:11.860
 and I'm trying to improve my health as I do that.

1:03:11.860 --> 1:03:12.700
 What should I do?

1:03:12.700 --> 1:03:16.100
 Well, certainly focusing a bit on the gut microbiome

1:03:16.100 --> 1:03:17.540
 ought to be useful.

1:03:17.540 --> 1:03:19.220
 The other thing I should mention is

1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:21.040
 as people wean themselves off alcohol,

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:23.300
 even if they're not full-blown alcoholics

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:24.980
 or have alcohol use disorder,

1:03:24.980 --> 1:03:28.900
 they should understand that that increase in cortisol

1:03:28.900 --> 1:03:29.880
 that we talked about earlier

1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:32.020
 that leads to lower stress threshold

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:34.580
 and greater feelings of anxiety and stress,

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:36.940
 that's going to be present

1:03:36.940 --> 1:03:39.280
 and it's going to take some time to dissipate.

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:42.600
 So for some people, it might even just be helpful to realize

1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:45.520
 that as you try and wean yourself off alcohol

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:47.220
 or maybe even go cold turkey,

1:03:47.220 --> 1:03:51.340
 that increased anxiety and feelings of stress

1:03:51.340 --> 1:03:52.620
 should be expected.

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:54.400
 And in that case, I would point you to an episode

1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:55.940
 that we did on master stress.

1:03:55.940 --> 1:03:57.720
 You can find that again at hubermanlab.com.

1:03:57.720 --> 1:03:59.580
 It's got a ton of behavioral, nutritional,

1:03:59.580 --> 1:04:01.600
 supplementation-based, exercise-based,

1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:03.340
 I suppose exercise is behavioral,

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:05.820
 but a lot of tools, you can navigate to those easily

1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:06.700
 because we have timestamps.

1:04:06.700 --> 1:04:08.340
 You can go right to the topic of interest.

1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:09.720
 Those tools are going to be very useful

1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:12.260
 in trying to clamp or control your stress.

1:04:12.260 --> 1:04:14.260
 And the point here is just that

1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:16.980
 some increase in stress should be expected

1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:18.100
 and it should be expected

1:04:18.100 --> 1:04:19.640
 because of that increase in cortisol

1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:22.340
 that occurs with even low-level consumption

1:04:22.340 --> 1:04:24.380
 yet chronic alcohol consumption.

1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:27.600
 Now I'd like to talk about a fairly common phenomenon,

1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:31.420
 which is post-alcohol consumption malaise,

1:04:31.420 --> 1:04:33.980
 also referred to as hangover.

1:04:33.980 --> 1:04:37.040
 Hangover is a constellation of effects

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:40.120
 ranging from headache to nausea

1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:42.500
 to what's sometimes called a anxiety,

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:45.760
 which is anxiety that follows a day of drinking.

1:04:46.940 --> 1:04:50.200
 Anxiety, I think we can understand physiologically

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:54.860
 if we think about that process of alcohol intake

1:04:54.860 --> 1:04:56.900
 increasing the amount of cortisol

1:04:56.900 --> 1:05:00.540
 and the ratio of cortisol to some other stress hormones.

1:05:00.540 --> 1:05:04.220
 That well explains why some people wake up the day after

1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:08.740
 or even the day after a night drinking

1:05:08.740 --> 1:05:11.420
 and feel anxious and not well and stressed

1:05:11.420 --> 1:05:13.200
 for reasons they don't understand.

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:17.260
 So if you're somebody who experiences anxiety,

1:05:17.260 --> 1:05:20.460
 then again, I refer you to the master stress episode

1:05:20.460 --> 1:05:22.340
 that we put out some time ago

1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:24.300
 and you can find that at hubermanlab.com.

1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:26.460
 Tools to deal with anxiety, tools to deal with stress

1:05:26.460 --> 1:05:27.860
 ranging again from behavioral

1:05:27.860 --> 1:05:30.840
 to nutritional supplement-based, et cetera.

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:33.180
 That of course is not justification

1:05:33.180 --> 1:05:34.640
 for going out and drinking so much

1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:38.000
 that you get anxiety-induced hangover.

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.920
 But for those of you that are experiencing

1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:43.380
 post-alcohol consumption, hangxiety as it were,

1:05:43.380 --> 1:05:44.780
 that could be a useful resource

1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:46.380
 because I certainly don't want anyone

1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:49.120
 experiencing uncomfortable amounts of anxiety

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:51.540
 and there are great tools and resources for that.

1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:54.100
 Now, the other aspects of hangover

1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:58.320
 such as the stomach ache or headache

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:01.140
 or feelings of malaise or fogginess,

1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:02.780
 those can be related to a number of different things

1:06:02.780 --> 1:06:05.140
 and probably are related to a number of different things.

1:06:05.140 --> 1:06:10.020
 First of all, the sleep that one gets after even just one,

1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:13.940
 yes, even just one glass of wine or a beer

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:15.660
 is not the same sleep that you get

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:18.260
 when you don't have alcohol circulating in your system.

1:06:18.260 --> 1:06:19.620
 And not trying to be a downer here,

1:06:19.620 --> 1:06:22.660
 but this was discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast episode

1:06:22.660 --> 1:06:26.100
 where I had Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley on

1:06:26.100 --> 1:06:29.820
 and of course, Dr. Walker is a world expert in sleep,

1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:31.540
 runs one of the preeminent laboratories

1:06:31.540 --> 1:06:33.500
 studying sleep and its effects,

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:36.540
 wrote the incredible book, Why We Sleep and so on.

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:41.180
 Dr. Walker told me, and it certainly is supported by

1:06:41.180 --> 1:06:43.300
 lots and lots of quality peer-reviewed studies

1:06:43.300 --> 1:06:45.020
 in animals and in humans,

1:06:45.020 --> 1:06:48.420
 that when alcohol is present in the brain and bloodstream,

1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:50.260
 that the architecture of sleep is disrupted.

1:06:50.260 --> 1:06:53.140
 Slow wave sleep, deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep,

1:06:53.140 --> 1:06:54.060
 all of which are essential

1:06:54.060 --> 1:06:56.260
 for getting a restorative night's sleep are all disrupted.

1:06:56.260 --> 1:06:58.460
 So for those of you that are drinking

1:06:58.460 --> 1:06:59.700
 a glass or two of wine

1:06:59.700 --> 1:07:03.700
 or having a hard liquor drink or a beer

1:07:03.700 --> 1:07:05.360
 in order to fall asleep,

1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:07.900
 the sleep you're getting is simply not high quality sleep

1:07:07.900 --> 1:07:09.280
 or certainly not as high quality

1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:10.300
 as the sleep you'd be getting

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.940
 if you did not have alcohol in your system.

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:14.760
 Of course, when we're talking about hangover,

1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:17.100
 we're talking generally about the consumption

1:07:17.100 --> 1:07:19.540
 of more than just one or two drinks.

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:20.580
 Of course, for some people,

1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:23.200
 one or two drinks is probably sufficient to induce hangover,

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:25.900
 but for most people, it's going to be having three or four

1:07:25.900 --> 1:07:28.580
 exceeding their typical limit, as it's called.

1:07:28.580 --> 1:07:29.860
 Again, not the legal limit.

1:07:29.860 --> 1:07:31.680
 That's a whole other business.

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:35.160
 But when one ingests too much alcohol for them,

1:07:36.580 --> 1:07:39.300
 one of the reasons they feel terrible the next day

1:07:39.300 --> 1:07:41.340
 is because their sleep isn't really good sleep.

1:07:41.340 --> 1:07:42.860
 In fact, it's not even sleep.

1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:44.820
 It's often considered pseudo sleep,

1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:45.740
 or at least that's what it's called

1:07:45.740 --> 1:07:47.060
 in the sleep science field,

1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:49.980
 because people are in kind of a low level hypnotic

1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:50.820
 kind of trance.

1:07:50.820 --> 1:07:51.640
 It's not real sleep.

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:52.940
 There are multiple bouts of waking up.

1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:55.860
 They may not even realize they're waking up multiple times.

1:07:55.860 --> 1:07:57.620
 Okay, so there's the sleep-induced effects.

1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:01.860
 Then there are the disrupted gut microbiome effects,

1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:03.140
 some of which we talked about earlier.

1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:04.980
 So now you understand the mechanism

1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:09.520
 of alcohol destroying good, healthy gut microbiota,

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:12.240
 which then leads to leaky gut and things of that sort.

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:14.980
 But one could imagine, again, could imagine,

1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:17.700
 and there is some evidence starting to support this,

1:08:17.700 --> 1:08:21.480
 that, again, ingesting low-sugar fermented foods

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:23.300
 or maybe in prebiotic or probiotic

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:24.740
 to support the gut microbiome

1:08:24.740 --> 1:08:28.580
 might assist in some of the gut-related malaise

1:08:28.580 --> 1:08:29.780
 associated with hangover.

1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:33.420
 In other words, get those gut microbiota healthy again

1:08:33.420 --> 1:08:34.340
 as quickly as possible,

1:08:34.340 --> 1:08:36.060
 or maybe even before you drink,

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:37.320
 have those gut microbiota healthy.

1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:38.160
 I would hope that you would do that.

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:39.540
 I think everybody should be doing something

1:08:39.540 --> 1:08:40.920
 to support their gut microbiome,

1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:41.940
 whether or not it's the ingestion

1:08:41.940 --> 1:08:43.780
 of low-sugar fermented foods daily

1:08:43.780 --> 1:08:45.540
 or at least on a regular basis,

1:08:45.540 --> 1:08:47.940
 or ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.

1:08:47.940 --> 1:08:49.420
 The gut microbiome is so important

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:51.100
 for so many different things.

1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:54.980
 In terms of hangover and headache,

1:08:54.980 --> 1:08:58.000
 we know that that's caused by vasoconstriction,

1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.500
 the constriction of blood vessels

1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:02.900
 that tends to occur as a rebound after a night of drinking.

1:09:02.900 --> 1:09:04.780
 Alcohol can act as a vasodilator.

1:09:04.780 --> 1:09:06.020
 It can dilate the blood vessels.

1:09:06.020 --> 1:09:09.300
 Part of that is associated with the increase

1:09:09.300 --> 1:09:11.300
 in so-called parasympathetic tone.

1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:12.760
 We have an autonomic nervous system.

1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:14.900
 It's got a sympathetic component.

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:17.180
 These are neurons that make us more alert,

1:09:17.180 --> 1:09:19.540
 and if they're very active, they make us very stressed.

1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:22.620
 There's also the parasympathetic aspect

1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:23.660
 of the autonomic nervous system.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:25.140
 This is all just fancy geek speak

1:09:25.140 --> 1:09:26.940
 for the parts of your brain and body,

1:09:26.940 --> 1:09:28.580
 the nerve cells that make you very relaxed.

1:09:28.580 --> 1:09:32.700
 When you're very relaxed, there tends to be vasodilation.

1:09:32.700 --> 1:09:35.620
 It allows for more movement of blood and other things

1:09:35.620 --> 1:09:37.420
 through the bloodstream,

1:09:37.420 --> 1:09:40.660
 and alcohol tends to induce some vasodilation,

1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:42.340
 at least in some of the capillary beds,

1:09:42.340 --> 1:09:44.340
 and then when the alcohol wears off,

1:09:44.340 --> 1:09:48.100
 there's vasoconstriction, and people get brutal headaches.

1:09:48.100 --> 1:09:50.940
 That's why some people will take aspirin or Tylenol

1:09:50.940 --> 1:09:53.420
 or Advil or things like that,

1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:55.860
 the sort of non-steroid anti-inflammatories.

1:09:55.860 --> 1:09:58.560
 I should mention there's a lot of literature coming out

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:02.300
 that some of these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

1:10:02.300 --> 1:10:04.500
 are not good for us for a number of different reasons,

1:10:04.500 --> 1:10:06.320
 the way they impact the liver,

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:08.300
 the way they impact the immune system,

1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:11.860
 and no surprise, the way they impact the gut microbiome.

1:10:11.860 --> 1:10:14.400
 So I'm not one to tell you what medications

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:16.380
 to take or not take, but you certainly would want to do

1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:21.100
 a quick web search of effects of non-steroid

1:10:21.100 --> 1:10:24.940
 anti-inflammatories and aspirin before you start taking those

1:10:24.940 --> 1:10:27.620
 or stop taking those for that matter.

1:10:27.620 --> 1:10:29.120
 Generally, they will alleviate headache,

1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.820
 but they can often have other issues, including liver issues

1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:33.820
 and keep in mind, the night after drinking,

1:10:33.820 --> 1:10:35.980
 your liver has already taken a beating

1:10:35.980 --> 1:10:40.500
 because of the need of the liver to convert alcohol

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:42.820
 from acetaldehyde into acetate,

1:10:42.820 --> 1:10:45.020
 which is now a pathway that you well understand.

1:10:45.020 --> 1:10:47.100
 So I'm not certain, and in fact,

1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:48.540
 I believe it's not the greatest idea

1:10:48.540 --> 1:10:52.500
 to burden your liver further through the use of things

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:54.940
 that are going to cause it to have to work harder

1:10:54.940 --> 1:10:57.140
 and metabolize things if the goal is simply

1:10:57.140 --> 1:10:58.680
 to alleviate a headache.

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:01.100
 There's a lot of kind of lore,

1:11:01.100 --> 1:11:03.060
 old school lore about how to relieve a hangover.

1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:06.060
 We already talked about how eating food won't do that,

1:11:06.060 --> 1:11:09.620
 but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption

1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:11.880
 of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:14.660
 There's the lore that one should simply ingest

1:11:14.660 --> 1:11:17.260
 more alcohol, what terrible advice that is,

1:11:17.260 --> 1:11:19.460
 that's just going to delay an even worse hangover.

1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:22.220
 However, I'd be remiss if I didn't say

1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:25.420
 that the reason that that myth came to be,

1:11:25.420 --> 1:11:28.360
 or that I should say that truth came to be,

1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:31.120
 because indeed ingesting more alcohol

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:32.640
 will alleviate a hangover,

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:34.700
 but then a worse hangover will show up.

1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:36.780
 The reason that came to be is because ingestion

1:11:36.780 --> 1:11:39.760
 of more alcohol will cause those constricted vessels

1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:42.000
 that are giving the headache to dilate again,

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.660
 but of course, ingesting more alcohol

1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:45.960
 to relieve a hangover is simply a bad idea.

1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:46.800
 Just don't do it.

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.680
 I think this is called the hair of the dog approach.

1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:51.220
 Maybe someone can put in the show note captions on YouTube

1:11:51.220 --> 1:11:53.020
 why it's called the hair of the dog.

1:11:53.900 --> 1:11:55.320
 I can come up with a few ideas,

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:58.420
 but they're not going to be very good ones.

1:11:58.420 --> 1:12:01.940
 And some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.

1:12:01.940 --> 1:12:04.600
 So do not ingest more alcohol simply to try

1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:06.580
 and recover from a hangover.

1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.700
 I know many people have tried that one before,

1:12:08.700 --> 1:12:10.500
 but that's a terrible idea.

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:12.060
 Now, one thing that you'll also hear out there

1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:14.180
 is that deliberate cold exposure,

1:12:14.180 --> 1:12:17.180
 for instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.

1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:18.740
 I find this one particularly interesting

1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:20.900
 because we've done episodes on the benefits

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:21.840
 of deliberate cold exposure.

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:23.800
 We have an entire episode about that.

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:26.360
 You can find it again, hubermanlab.com.

1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:28.040
 There are direct links to some of the tools

1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:29.840
 related to deliberate cold exposure.

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:32.700
 And we have an entire newsletter

1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:34.460
 on deliberate cold exposure protocols.

1:12:34.460 --> 1:12:35.820
 You can find on hubermanlab.com

1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:37.700
 go to our neural network newsletter.

1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:39.660
 So those of you that are interested in ice baths

1:12:39.660 --> 1:12:42.140
 and cold showers and ways to leverage those,

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:43.440
 you can find that there.

1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:45.200
 What you won't find there is a description

1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:46.600
 of how to use deliberate cold exposure

1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:48.100
 for sake of treating hangover.

1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:49.420
 But here I went into the literature

1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:51.060
 and I found something kind of interesting.

1:12:51.060 --> 1:12:54.720
 There is some evidence that increasing levels of epinephrine

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:58.680
 in the bloodstream can actually help with alcohol clearance.

1:12:58.680 --> 1:12:59.920
 That was very surprising to me.

1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:02.000
 And I want to point out this is not a large

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.140
 and robust literature, but there's some evidence

1:13:04.140 --> 1:13:06.300
 pointing to the fact that when levels of epinephrine,

1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:08.920
 adrenaline, are raised in the brain and bloodstream,

1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:11.120
 that some of the components of alcohol metabolism

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:14.420
 can be accelerated and some of the inebriating effects

1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:15.780
 of alcohol can be reduced.

1:13:15.780 --> 1:13:18.320
 So maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower

1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:19.660
 actually has something to it.

1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:22.000
 So in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.560
 in order to reduce the effects of hangover

1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:28.040
 or to more rapidly clear alcohol

1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:29.740
 from the brain and bloodstream,

1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:34.520
 I want to be very clear and I want to emphasize your safety.

1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:36.400
 The way to do that is to understand

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:39.800
 that alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay?

1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:42.540
 It can make people slightly hypothermic.

1:13:42.540 --> 1:13:44.960
 It's going to drop core body temperature.

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:48.080
 So if you were inebriated and you went

1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:50.000
 and got into a body of water, right?

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000
 A pool or a lake or something,

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.240
 first of all, that's extremely dangerous to do

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:55.560
 while you're inebriated, right?

1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:56.760
 People drown all the time.

1:13:56.760 --> 1:13:59.120
 People drown, they die as a consequence of doing that.

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:00.940
 So please don't do that.

1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:03.040
 But also if it's a very cold water,

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:05.740
 your core body temperature is going to drop even further.

1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:07.120
 Now, if you've heard the episodes

1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:09.660
 that I've done on deliberate cold exposure,

1:14:09.660 --> 1:14:12.080
 previously I've talked about how normally

1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:14.300
 when people are not ingesting alcohol,

1:14:14.300 --> 1:14:16.040
 they get into an ice bath or a cold shower

1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:17.800
 and their body temperature initially dips,

1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:19.420
 but then it rebounds and increases.

1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:20.920
 That's a process that's going to occur

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:23.560
 when people do not have alcohol in their system.

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:24.980
 When you have alcohol in your system,

1:14:24.980 --> 1:14:27.660
 one of the reasons that you become hypothermic

1:14:27.660 --> 1:14:29.160
 is because there's a disruption

1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:30.620
 in those hypothalamic brain areas,

1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:33.460
 in particular the brain area called the medial preoptic area

1:14:33.460 --> 1:14:35.400
 that regulates core body temperature.

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:37.980
 So it's not so much that alcohol makes you cold,

1:14:37.980 --> 1:14:41.480
 it's that alcohol disrupts the central command centers

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:43.740
 of the brain that control temperature regulation

1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:46.740
 and that leads you to be slightly hypothermic.

1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:49.160
 So if you then go get into a very cold lake

1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:52.540
 or you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath,

1:14:52.540 --> 1:14:55.800
 there's the possibility of you going very, very far

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:59.200
 down the ladder into very hypothermic territory

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:00.740
 and that can be very dangerous.

1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:02.360
 Now, in terms of dealing with hangover

1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:05.200
 when the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system,

1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:07.920
 well, that's where some of this kind of old lore

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.600
 combines with some of the modern science and says,

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:12.160
 well, if you can spike adrenaline

1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:15.200
 and certainly getting into an ice bath

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:16.880
 or getting into a cold shower

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:19.120
 or any kind of cold body of water

1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:20.360
 provided you can do that safely,

1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:22.680
 that will sharply increase your adrenaline

1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:24.720
 and I should say your dopamine, that's been shown

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:26.380
 and we've talked about this on the podcast before,

1:15:26.380 --> 1:15:28.780
 you get these long extended increases,

1:15:28.780 --> 1:15:30.420
 several hours of increases in dopamine

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:31.760
 from deliberate cold exposure.

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:34.200
 It's well-documented in humans, by the way.

1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:37.920
 So one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:41.880
 as a way to accelerate the recovery from hangover

1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:43.260
 provided that's done safely.

1:15:43.260 --> 1:15:45.500
 I think there's no reason to not explore that

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:47.860
 and if you wonder what safely is

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:49.240
 and what temperatures to use,

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:52.540
 please check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure.

1:15:52.540 --> 1:15:55.840
 Cold showers therefore might actually be one way

1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:57.640
 to at least partially relieve hangover.

1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:01.260
 Certainly the science from various places in the literature

1:16:01.260 --> 1:16:04.000
 converge to say that, but again, be careful,

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:05.680
 please, please, please be careful

1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:09.200
 not to get into cold water when you are inebriated.

1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:12.180
 It's absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons

1:16:12.180 --> 1:16:14.680
 and it's dangerous also for the non-obvious reasons,

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:17.800
 not the least of which is the dramatic decreases

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:18.980
 in core body temperature

1:16:18.980 --> 1:16:21.380
 that can make you dangerously hypothermic.

1:16:21.380 --> 1:16:23.640
 Now, how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure

1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:25.520
 to accelerate recovery from hangover?

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:28.400
 Well, there I would look to the kind of standard protocols

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:30.520
 of one to three minutes or maybe even six minutes

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:33.280
 if you can tolerate or if you're really cold adapted,

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:35.760
 maybe you do seven or 10 minutes in a cold shower,

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:36.640
 although that could be a lot.

1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.280
 Most people are going to experience a sharp increase

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:41.640
 in epinephrine and adrenaline

1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:44.200
 and a long lasting increase in dopamine

1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:47.460
 from one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure,

1:16:47.460 --> 1:16:49.200
 ideally done immersion up to the neck.

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:51.280
 Again, do this safely, please, please, please

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:53.200
 or a cold shower where you're getting under the shower

1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:54.040
 as much as possible.

1:16:54.040 --> 1:16:54.860
 How cold?

1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:56.680
 Well, that's going to vary person to person.

1:16:56.680 --> 1:16:59.520
 I suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:00.880
 such that you really want to get out,

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:02.560
 but then you know you can stay in safely without,

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:03.800
 for instance, giving yourself a heart attack

1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:05.420
 because if the water is really, really cold,

1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:06.720
 of course you can give yourself a heart attack.

1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:08.400
 Most showers won't go that cold,

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.380
 although probably some will.

1:17:10.380 --> 1:17:12.800
 Again, please use caution, spike your adrenaline,

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:15.860
 spike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely.

1:17:15.860 --> 1:17:18.200
 Other components of hangover that could be good targets

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:19.960
 for trying to alleviate hangover,

1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:21.960
 and here I hope you are getting the picture

1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:25.600
 because it is accurate to say that hangover

1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:27.720
 is a multifaceted phenomenon.

1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:29.560
 It's not like one molecule and one receptor,

1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:31.800
 it's a bunch of things happening in the brain and body,

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:34.840
 but is the dehydration associated with alcohol?

1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:37.800
 Alcohol is a diuretic for multiple reasons.

1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:41.860
 It causes people to excrete not only water, but also sodium.

1:17:41.860 --> 1:17:43.480
 Sodium is an electrolyte critical

1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:44.640
 for the function of neurons.

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:47.040
 So making sure that you have enough sodium, potassium,

1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:49.460
 and magnesium, so-called electrolytes

1:17:49.460 --> 1:17:53.000
 is going to be important for proper brain function,

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:54.560
 bodily organ function.

1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:56.600
 Even for people that have just had one or two drinks

1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:59.900
 the night before, it's likely that your electrolyte balance

1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:02.320
 and your fluid balance is going to be disrupted,

1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:04.480
 and that's because alcohol also disrupts

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:06.320
 the so-called vasopressin pathway.

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:08.480
 I talked a lot about vasopressin

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:11.000
 and the way that it interacts with

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.620
 and controls different aspects of water retention

1:18:13.620 --> 1:18:16.180
 and water release from the body in the form of urine

1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:18.180
 in the episode on salt.

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:21.760
 So again, I'm referring to Hubermanlab.com

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:24.040
 as the site where you can find that episode on salt balance

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.120
 and ways to restore electrolyte balance.

1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:29.740
 Having your electrolytes at the proper levels

1:18:29.740 --> 1:18:31.320
 before you drink is ideal.

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:34.200
 Some people will say for every glass of alcohol

1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:36.880
 that you drink, you should drink one glass of water.

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:40.040
 I would say better would be two glasses of water

1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:42.040
 given the dehydrating effects of alcohol,

1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:44.520
 and even better would be water with electrolytes.

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.680
 That certainly would set you up for a better day

1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:47.840
 the next day.

1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:50.120
 And if you don't manage to do that,

1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:51.200
 because I suppose it's kind of geeky

1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:53.440
 walking around with electrolyte packets

1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.040
 out at the bar or whatnot,

1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:59.080
 although, you know, geeky in my book is a good thing,

1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:02.540
 the next day you could take some electrolytes upon waking,

1:19:02.540 --> 1:19:04.640
 maybe even some before you go to sleep

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:05.940
 at the night of drinking.

1:19:05.940 --> 1:19:09.000
 So hangovers made worse by disturbed sleep,

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.840
 made worse by disrupted gut microbiome,

1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:13.020
 made worse by disrupted electrolytes,

1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:16.400
 made worse by the depletion of epinephrine and dopamine.

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:19.800
 That's why replenishing the microbiome with fermented foods,

1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:21.680
 low sugar fermented foods that is,

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:25.560
 that's why using safe deliberate cold exposure

1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:29.920
 for spiking adrenaline and for increasing dopamine.

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:32.600
 And that's why consuming electrolytes

1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:34.760
 are all going to be beneficial.

1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:38.440
 The folks over at examine.com, a website that I really like

1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:41.120
 because it just has so much useful information,

1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:45.320
 have assembled a list of things that have been proposed,

1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:48.840
 purported to improve, or I should say,

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:51.600
 to remove the effects of hangover.

1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:54.320
 And as they point out, and I would like to point out

1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:56.880
 over there, there isn't a lot of quality science

1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:59.760
 to support the idea that any one compound

1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:01.080
 can eliminate hangover.

1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:03.120
 And that's probably because hangover, again,

1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:05.920
 arises from multiple organs and tissues and systems

1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:07.380
 in both the brain and body.

1:20:07.380 --> 1:20:10.720
 Nonetheless, they have a terrific list over there of things,

1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:14.000
 everything from Japanese pear fruit juice

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.280
 has been proposed to do this

1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:17.560
 to some other really esoteric things,

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:20.800
 even things like yohimbine.

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:23.760
 Frankly, when I look at the literature,

1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:25.520
 there and elsewhere,

1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:29.160
 one simply cannot find the magic substance,

1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:33.820
 the one herb, the one potion that can wipe away hangover.

1:20:33.820 --> 1:20:37.400
 Getting rid of hangover is going to be best solved

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.080
 by doing a collection of a small number

1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:41.760
 of very powerful things,

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:44.400
 of which I've already listed off a few.

1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:46.040
 However, there are some additional things

1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:48.440
 that one can do for relieving hangover.

1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:51.820
 And one of them is to be very thoughtful

1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:54.360
 about what sorts of alcohol one consumes.

1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:56.120
 So I find this interesting.

1:20:56.120 --> 1:20:57.680
 There have actually been studies

1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:02.200
 of which types of alcohol lead to the greatest hangovers.

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:06.200
 There's actually a lot of legend and lore about this as well.

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:07.560
 Some people have said, for instance,

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:10.160
 that drinks that have a high sugar content

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:12.320
 lead to greater hangovers.

1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:13.640
 Turns out that's not the case,

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:15.720
 or at least that's not what the science points to.

1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:18.780
 If you look at the expected hangover severity,

1:21:18.780 --> 1:21:21.960
 what you find is that at the bottom end of the scale,

1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:25.840
 there's a drink that I'm not going to tell you for the moment

1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:28.940
 but what you find is that near it is, for instance, beer.

1:21:28.940 --> 1:21:31.200
 The consumption of beer,

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:33.600
 provided it is not over consumption, right?

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.840
 It's not far beyond the tolerance of the individual.

1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:38.300
 So there's one or two beers,

1:21:38.300 --> 1:21:42.640
 is less likely to cause a hangover than say whiskey.

1:21:42.640 --> 1:21:44.260
 And a glass of whiskey,

1:21:44.260 --> 1:21:46.880
 or I should not as much whiskey as beer, of course,

1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:48.480
 but a glass of whiskey, for instance,

1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:53.080
 is more likely to cause hangover than gin, as it turns out.

1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:56.360
 Again, this is what's fallen out of the data.

1:21:56.360 --> 1:22:00.080
 And yet a glass of rum or red wine

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:02.080
 is more likely to cause a hangover

1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:04.420
 than any of the other things I've mentioned so far.

1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:06.560
 At the top, top, top of the list of drinks

1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:08.960
 that induce hangover is brandy.

1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:10.800
 And one could then say,

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:12.600
 well, doesn't brandy have a lot of sugar?

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.440
 Maybe it's the sugar that's causing hangovers.

1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:16.000
 And this is something that's been, again,

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.480
 discussed over and over that people say,

1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:19.880
 oh, it's the high sugar drinks that cause hangover.

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:24.360
 It turns out, however, that when one looks at drinks,

1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:26.920
 alcoholic drinks and sugar content and hangover,

1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:29.240
 at the very bottom of the list is,

1:22:30.100 --> 1:22:32.000
 gosh, this makes me cringe just to think about,

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.360
 is ethanol diluted in orange juice?

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:37.580
 Ugh, I can't believe people actually drink this,

1:22:37.580 --> 1:22:39.280
 but ethanol diluted in orange juice.

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:41.400
 So this is not vodka and orange juice, okay?

1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:43.840
 Vodka was third on the list from the bottom

1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:45.320
 of drinks that induce hangover.

1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:49.440
 Again, this is within amounts that are comfortable

1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:50.280
 for the person to drink,

1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:52.040
 that they have enough experience with

1:22:52.040 --> 1:22:53.640
 or that they have the body weight to tolerate

1:22:53.640 --> 1:22:55.540
 without getting very, very drunk.

1:22:55.540 --> 1:22:58.640
 So the point is that if it were sugar

1:22:58.640 --> 1:22:59.720
 that's causing hangover,

1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:02.940
 well, then the ethanol diluted in orange juice

1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:04.680
 would probably be at the top of the list

1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:06.720
 in terms of inducing hangover, but it's not.

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:07.780
 It's at the bottom of the list.

1:23:07.780 --> 1:23:09.920
 And brandy is at the top of the list.

1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:12.920
 So what you find is that what scales

1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:15.360
 from ethanol diluted in orange juice

1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:16.640
 to beer to vodka to gin,

1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:18.520
 here I'm ascending the hierarchy of things

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:21.200
 that cause hangover, gin, white wine, whiskey,

1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:24.100
 rum, red wine, and then brandy at the peak,

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:26.640
 it's sort of the world heavyweight champion

1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:29.160
 of hangover inducing drinks.

1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:34.160
 Well, what's increasing are congeners within those drinks.

1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:37.900
 Congeners are things like nitrites and other substances

1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:41.720
 that give alcohol its distinctive flavor

1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:44.680
 and that also lead to some of the

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:46.880
 inebriating effects of alcohol.

1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:48.040
 Now then you ask, okay, well,

1:23:48.040 --> 1:23:50.820
 what is it that these congeners are doing

1:23:50.820 --> 1:23:52.160
 and what are these nitrates doing?

1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:53.520
 And guess what?

1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:55.120
 While they do have effects on the brain

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:57.040
 and on other tissues,

1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:00.840
 their main effects are to disrupt the gut microbiome.

1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:03.400
 So what this points to again

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:05.860
 is that having a healthy gut microbiome

1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:10.700
 and perhaps ensuring that you bolster your gut microbiome,

1:24:10.700 --> 1:24:14.520
 the day after drinking is going to be especially important

1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:16.600
 for warding off hangover,

1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:19.400
 or at least reducing the effects of hangover

1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:21.560
 or the symptoms of hangover or both.

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:24.080
 I would love to see a study on this.

1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:25.960
 I could imagine designing the study myself,

1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:27.640
 although this isn't really the sorts of things

1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:29.120
 my laboratory does,

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:31.760
 but you can imagine some people getting probiotic

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.920
 and prebiotic, some regularly,

1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:37.200
 some just after drinking or low sugar fermented foods

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:38.220
 and see what the effects are

1:24:38.220 --> 1:24:40.620
 in terms of subjective effects of hangover,

1:24:40.620 --> 1:24:43.320
 but also some physiological measures.

1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:45.780
 I think the way to think about hangover overall

1:24:45.780 --> 1:24:50.120
 is that, again, it represents a multifaceted,

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:53.980
 multi-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon.

1:24:53.980 --> 1:24:55.560
 And the best way to deal with it

1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:59.840
 is as a multi-cell, multi-tissue, multi-chemical phenomenon.

1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:01.360
 And before I listed off some of the things

1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:03.980
 that one could do in order to adjust hangover,

1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:08.640
 again, the one that comes out at the top of that list,

1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:10.900
 I believe, at least based on my read of the data,

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:13.400
 is to support the gut microbiome

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:16.580
 and certainly not to ingest more alcohol.

1:25:16.580 --> 1:25:19.080
 And I suppose if we were to get really honest

1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:22.060
 with one another and ask what's the best way

1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:23.360
 to avoid a hangover,

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:25.600
 it would be to not drink in the first place.

1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:28.160
 So we've covered the major effects of alcohol

1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:31.080
 that lead to this state that we call

1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:33.320
 drunkenness or inebriation.

1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:34.480
 Again, there's a range there.

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:37.180
 It can be tipsy, people can be blackout drunk,

1:25:37.180 --> 1:25:39.300
 people can be passed out drunk.

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:42.000
 We've also talked about hangover

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.480
 and the fact that it's a multifaceted phenomenon

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:46.120
 and recovery from hangover

1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:48.800
 involves a multifaceted approach.

1:25:49.660 --> 1:25:51.700
 Next, I want to talk about tolerance.

1:25:51.700 --> 1:25:54.440
 Tolerance to alcohol is a very interesting phenomenon.

1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:58.400
 It has roots mainly in the brain and in brain systems.

1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:02.160
 There's not time in the world,

1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:03.560
 let alone within this podcast,

1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:05.520
 to get into all the aspects of tolerance.

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:08.080
 There are more than 10 different types of tolerance.

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:09.080
 There's functional tolerance,

1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:10.980
 chronic tolerance, rapid tolerance.

1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:12.400
 There's metabolic tolerance.

1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:14.600
 There's psychological tolerance.

1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:16.700
 Let's keep it simple for sake of today's discussion.

1:26:16.700 --> 1:26:18.540
 And for those of you that are interested in learning

1:26:18.540 --> 1:26:20.320
 about all the different types of tolerance

1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:22.360
 and aspects of tolerance,

1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:23.700
 there's an excellent review.

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:24.980
 We will provide a link to this.

1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:26.440
 This was published in 2021.

1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:28.080
 So it's pretty recent in the journal

1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:30.680
 Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior.

1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:32.560
 Incidentally or not so incidentally,

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:34.400
 that was the first journal I ever published in.

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:38.400
 So I have a particular affection for that journal.

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:41.360
 Nonetheless, it is called tolerance to alcohol,

1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:44.640
 a critical yet understudied factor in alcohol addiction.

1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:48.480
 And while this paper does include alcohol addiction

1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:52.640
 in the title, it's not just about alcohol addiction.

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:54.760
 Here's the basic summary of what tolerance is.

1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:57.840
 First of all, tolerance refers to the reduced effects

1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:01.000
 of alcohol with repeated exposure.

1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.240
 And it is caused mainly by changes

1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:06.120
 in neurotransmitter systems in the brain

1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:09.500
 that are the direct consequence of the toxicity of alcohol,

1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:12.660
 that aldehyde molecule that we talked about before.

1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:16.360
 There's an enormous number of chemicals that change

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.000
 with repeated exposure to acetaldehyde,

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.280
 everything from GABA to dopamine to serotonin,

1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:25.120
 second messenger systems, adenosine and on and on.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.960
 Rather than go into each of those in detail,

1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:31.240
 I just want to talk about the contour of the reinforcing

1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:33.320
 and the tolerance inducing effects of alcohol.

1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:34.640
 What do I mean by that?

1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:38.680
 Well, here we are back to our old friend,

1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:41.660
 meaning the molecule that comes up over and over again

1:27:41.660 --> 1:27:44.880
 in these podcast episodes, which is dopamine.

1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:47.200
 Whether or not somebody has a predisposition alcoholism

1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:49.900
 or not, whether or not they're experienced drinker or not,

1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:51.200
 when people initially start drinking,

1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:53.160
 there are increases in dopamine

1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:55.200
 or what we call dopaminergic transmission.

1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.240
 Dopamine is involved in motivation, craving,

1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:01.200
 it creates a sense of wellbeing, it increases energy,

1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:05.240
 again, typically only at the beginning of alcohol exposure.

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:07.840
 That occurs in most people as a sharp spike,

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:08.680
 as they increase.

1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:12.040
 Again, if somebody does not have alcohol dehydrogenase

1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:13.520
 or has very low levels of the enzyme

1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:16.400
 that convert that acetaldehyde into acetate

1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:19.040
 and metabolize alcohol, in other words,

1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:21.640
 they will feel sick and lousy in a way

1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:24.400
 that will override any recognition of the dopamine release.

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:26.160
 They're going to be the people that are listening to this

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:28.120
 and just think alcohol just makes me feel sick,

1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:29.200
 I don't like it.

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.300
 Okay, that's a specific subcategory of people,

1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:35.020
 but most people experience some sort of mild euphoria,

1:28:35.020 --> 1:28:36.660
 that's why so many people drink, right?

1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:38.620
 The current estimates are that in most countries

1:28:38.620 --> 1:28:40.040
 and certainly in the US,

1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:44.080
 as many as 80% of the adult legal drinking age population

1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:47.920
 drinks alcohol and that number could be even higher now

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:49.280
 because in the last couple of years,

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:51.360
 there's been a trend towards increased alcohol consumption,

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:54.160
 especially in the wake of the pandemic

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.760
 and during the pandemic topic for another time.

1:28:57.760 --> 1:28:59.420
 So there's an increase in dopamine

1:28:59.420 --> 1:29:01.180
 and an increase in serotonin,

1:29:01.180 --> 1:29:02.800
 so it's kind of an increase in wellbeing,

1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:06.840
 an increase in mood, but it's a very short-lived increase.

1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:10.160
 Very soon after and actually triggered by that increase

1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:15.160
 is a long and slow reduction in dopamine and serotonin

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:17.180
 and related molecules and circuits.

1:29:17.180 --> 1:29:19.640
 So basically what you're getting is a blip of feel good

1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:23.560
 followed by a long, slow arc of feeling not so great,

1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:26.220
 which is why typically people will drink again and again

1:29:26.220 --> 1:29:29.060
 across the night.

1:29:29.060 --> 1:29:31.800
 The key thing to understand about tolerance

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:34.280
 is that with tolerance,

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:38.000
 the duration of that long, slow reduction

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.160
 in dopamine and serotonin gets even longer.

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.640
 In other words, the negative effects of alcohol

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:49.240
 that happen after the initial feeling good extend longer

1:29:49.240 --> 1:29:52.100
 and in fact get more robust.

1:29:52.100 --> 1:29:55.480
 However, there's also a reduction

1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.300
 in the reinforcing properties of alcohol.

1:29:57.300 --> 1:30:00.200
 There's a shrinking of the feel good blip

1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:02.680
 that happens when one first ingests alcohol.

1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:04.820
 And this has been measured in animals and humans.

1:30:04.820 --> 1:30:06.860
 So the first drink that somebody has,

1:30:06.860 --> 1:30:09.360
 provided they have enough alcohol dehydrogenase

1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:11.820
 that doesn't make them feel nauseous and sick right away,

1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:13.800
 they feel really good.

1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:15.760
 And then as it wears off, they feel kind of lousy

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:17.720
 and they want to drink more, so they might drink more.

1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:19.780
 With each subsequent drink and even drinks

1:30:19.780 --> 1:30:23.480
 on different nights or even different weeks,

1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:26.720
 the amount of dopamine that's released is reduced.

1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:29.140
 The amount of serotonin that's released is reduced.

1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:31.540
 So what you're getting is less and less

1:30:31.540 --> 1:30:34.560
 of the reinforcing properties of alcohol,

1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:36.240
 the feel good stuff,

1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:38.280
 and more and more of the punishment

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:39.920
 pain signal aspects of alcohol.

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:44.920
 This is the contour of chemical release in the brain

1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:47.980
 that was referred to by my colleague,

1:30:47.980 --> 1:30:50.440
 the incredible Dr. Anna Lemke, who's a medical doctor.

1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:52.340
 She wrote the incredible book, Dopamine Nation.

1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:54.840
 She was a guest on this podcast, on Joe Rogan's podcast,

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:57.560
 on Rich Roll's podcast, and several other podcasts.

1:30:57.560 --> 1:30:58.800
 World expert in addiction,

1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:01.240
 and she talked about this pleasure pain balance

1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:05.360
 that extends beyond alcohol to things like sex and gambling

1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:09.000
 and to other behaviors that can potentially become addictive

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.200
 but certainly includes alcohol.

1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:15.560
 So tolerance, it seems, is a process in which people

1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:18.120
 are ingesting more and more alcohol

1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:22.480
 as an attempt to get that feeling of wellbeing back.

1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:24.860
 But what they're really getting is an extended period

1:31:24.860 --> 1:31:28.520
 of punishment, of pain, and of malaise from the alcohol.

1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:30.940
 Now you might say, well, how does that relate to tolerance?

1:31:30.940 --> 1:31:33.320
 Well, it turns out what they do behaviorally,

1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:34.920
 and when I say they, I mean, animals do this

1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:37.960
 and humans do this, is they start drinking more and more

1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:40.580
 in an attempt to activate those dopamine

1:31:40.580 --> 1:31:43.880
 and serotonin neurons and receptors.

1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:46.080
 And as they do that,

1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:48.680
 there is an increase in alcohol dehydrogenase.

1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:51.460
 So the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is increased

1:31:51.460 --> 1:31:53.420
 because the body and liver have to contend

1:31:53.420 --> 1:31:54.940
 with all that alcohol.

1:31:54.940 --> 1:31:57.020
 So now you've got, again, the two hit model.

1:31:57.020 --> 1:31:58.720
 You're getting less of the feel-good chemicals,

1:31:58.720 --> 1:32:01.080
 more of the negative chemical release

1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:05.040
 or pattern of subjective feeling, I should say,

1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:09.000
 and you're metabolizing alcohol more quickly

1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.800
 and more readily, but it's not taking you to a better place

1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:13.160
 in terms of how you feel.

1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:15.320
 That's one of the major underlying reasons

1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:16.580
 for what we call tolerance.

1:32:16.580 --> 1:32:17.800
 So if you're somebody who drinks

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.080
 and you notice that the feeling

1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:21.320
 that you are seeking with alcohol

1:32:21.320 --> 1:32:26.320
 is now requiring an additional drink or drinks, plural,

1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:29.200
 chances are you are disrupting the dopamine

1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:31.720
 and serotonergic systems of your brain,

1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:35.320
 and you are doing that in a way that is increasing

1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:37.220
 the pain and punishment signals

1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:40.240
 that follow alcohol ingestion.

1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:41.520
 And again, that's not just on the night

1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:43.720
 that you're drinking, but afterwards as well.

1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:44.800
 Is that all bad news?

1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:47.680
 Well, pretty much, but the good news is

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:50.860
 that if you abstain from drinking for some period of time,

1:32:50.860 --> 1:32:52.800
 then of course these systems reset.

1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:53.980
 How long you need to abstain

1:32:53.980 --> 1:32:55.680
 will depend on how much you were drinking

1:32:55.680 --> 1:32:56.840
 and how long you were drinking for.

1:32:56.840 --> 1:32:59.000
 Certainly people who have alcohol use disorder

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.500
 who are alcoholics,

1:33:00.500 --> 1:33:02.800
 their main goal should be to quit alcohol completely.

1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:04.320
 I know there's some debate about this,

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:05.760
 and I don't want to get into that debate

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:07.420
 because I'm certainly not going to try

1:33:07.420 --> 1:33:08.560
 and direct anyone's recovery.

1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:12.400
 There are expert counselors and MDs

1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:13.820
 and people that can work with people.

1:33:13.820 --> 1:33:15.900
 In fact, for some very heavy drinkers

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:18.020
 and people with serious alcohol use disorder,

1:33:18.020 --> 1:33:20.500
 going cold turkey that is stopping drinking completely

1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:22.500
 can actually be medically dangerous.

1:33:22.500 --> 1:33:25.500
 So the path to sobriety for certain people

1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:27.780
 looks different than the path to sobriety for other people.

1:33:27.780 --> 1:33:29.240
 What I'm referring to here

1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:31.080
 are people that are ingesting again

1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:34.600
 somewhere between on average one to two drinks per night,

1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:36.460
 whether or not that's done night to night

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:39.200
 or whether or not that's condensed to weekend use.

1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:41.160
 I know a number of people are going to ask,

1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:42.940
 perhaps are screaming,

1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:45.040
 is drinking good for me in any way?

1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:47.020
 For instance, many people have probably heard

1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:49.360
 that resveratrol is good for people

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:52.100
 and that red wine is enriched in resveratrol.

1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:52.940
 I hate to break it to you,

1:33:52.940 --> 1:33:57.360
 but the reality is that if indeed resveratrol is good for us

1:33:57.360 --> 1:33:58.620
 and there's some debate about this,

1:33:58.620 --> 1:33:59.900
 some people say strongly yes,

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:01.200
 some people say no,

1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:02.720
 other people say maybe,

1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:06.080
 the amount of red wine that one would have to drink

1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:07.920
 in order to get enough resveratrol

1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:10.260
 in order for it to be health promoting

1:34:10.260 --> 1:34:13.120
 is so outrageously high that it would surely

1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:14.440
 induce other negative effects

1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:17.280
 that would offset the positive effects of resveratrol.

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.760
 So I wish I could tell you different.

1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:22.440
 Again, I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news,

1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:24.500
 but the statement I just made was confirmed

1:34:24.500 --> 1:34:25.840
 by Dr. David Sinclair

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:27.600
 when he was a guest on this podcast.

1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:29.600
 It's confirmed by other researchers

1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:32.280
 who work on resveratrol and related pathways.

1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:34.400
 I wish I could tell you that red wine

1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:35.400
 is good for your health,

1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:39.320
 and indeed it might be through some other mechanisms.

1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:40.920
 So for instance, there have been studies

1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:44.240
 of low to moderate red wine consumption.

1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.420
 This would be anywhere from one to four glasses per week,

1:34:48.420 --> 1:34:50.180
 and I don't mean enormous glasses,

1:34:50.180 --> 1:34:53.140
 I mean six ounce glasses of red wine.

1:34:53.140 --> 1:34:54.360
 And in those cases,

1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:57.760
 some of the stress reduction that can be induced

1:34:57.760 --> 1:34:59.260
 by consumption of red wine,

1:34:59.260 --> 1:35:02.480
 maybe some of the other micronutrients and components

1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:03.520
 within red wines,

1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:05.880
 in particular red wines that come from particular grapes,

1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:07.560
 and this gets really nuanced,

1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:09.620
 and frankly is not well worked out

1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:11.600
 in the peer-reviewed literature,

1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.680
 certainly not clinical trials,

1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:14.760
 at least not that I'm aware of.

1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:17.460
 Tell me if you're aware of a great clinical trial on this.

1:35:17.460 --> 1:35:19.160
 Well, there may be some positive effects

1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:22.240
 of that very low level of consumption.

1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:24.320
 I'm not trying to take away anybody's red wine.

1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:27.540
 I'm not trying to take away anybody's anything.

1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:29.960
 I would be remiss, however,

1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:34.400
 if I didn't tell you that resveratrol

1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:36.240
 as the argument for drinking

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:39.060
 and drinking red wine in particular is just not a good one.

1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:42.160
 It's just not supported by the peer-reviewed research.

1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:45.620
 A few other things about alcohol and health.

1:35:45.620 --> 1:35:46.840
 The beginning of the episode,

1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:49.860
 I referenced a study showing that indeed,

1:35:49.860 --> 1:35:51.960
 not just heavy alcohol consumption

1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:53.660
 of 12 to 24 more drinks per week,

1:35:53.660 --> 1:35:56.520
 but also light to moderate alcohol consumption

1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.740
 of any type, wine, beer, spirits, et cetera,

1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:03.240
 does reduce the thickness of the brain.

1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:05.260
 It really does reduce cortical thickness.

1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:09.440
 In fact, it actually scales with the amount of alcohol

1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:10.480
 that people drink.

1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:12.800
 And this has been well-documented

1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:13.820
 in a number of different studies.

1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:16.120
 I can provide a link to several of these.

1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:17.800
 One of the more striking ones actually shows

1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:21.320
 that there's almost a dose-dependent increase

1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:23.320
 in shrinkage of the gray matter volume

1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:26.160
 and in these white matter tracks, these axons,

1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:29.820
 these wires, as it would, that connect different neurons

1:36:29.820 --> 1:36:31.520
 as a function of how much alcohol people drink.

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:34.080
 And that's also what's been seen in this recent study

1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:35.200
 that I referenced at the beginning,

1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:36.960
 and that's in the show note captions.

1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:40.040
 So again, probably the best amount of alcohol to drink

1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:43.600
 would be zero glasses per week or ounces per week.

1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:45.680
 For those of you drinking low amounts of alcohol,

1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:48.940
 make sure you're doing other things to promote your health.

1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:51.760
 And for those of you that are drinking moderate,

1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:53.720
 and certainly for those of you that are heavy drinkers,

1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:56.520
 please do everything you can to move away from that

1:36:56.520 --> 1:36:58.000
 and to quit entirely.

1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.520
 But even for the moderate consumers of alcohol,

1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:04.200
 you are going to want to be aware of some

1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:06.640
 of the negative health effects and do things to offset those

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:09.200
 if indeed you're not going to stop drinking

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:10.480
 or reduce your intake.

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:12.960
 One of the really bad effects of alcohol,

1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:15.600
 but that's extremely well-documented,

1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:18.220
 is the fact that alcohol,

1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:20.960
 because of this toxicity of acetaldehyde

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:24.440
 and related pathways, can alter DNA methylation,

1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:26.200
 it can alter gene expression.

1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:28.640
 That can be many things in different tissues,

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:33.640
 but it is associated with a significant increase

1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:36.400
 in cancer risk, in particular, breast cancer.

1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:39.520
 And in particular, because breast tissue is present

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:42.280
 in both males and females, but in women,

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:43.360
 it's especially vulnerable

1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:45.800
 to some of the DNA methylation changes.

1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:49.000
 Well, breast cancer in women has a relationship

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.300
 to alcohol intake and alcohol intake has a relationship

1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:53.080
 to breast cancer in women.

1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:58.080
 In fact, there has been proposed to be anywhere from four

1:37:59.020 --> 1:38:03.080
 to 13% increase in risk of breast cancer

1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:05.900
 for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.

1:38:05.900 --> 1:38:07.140
 How much is 10 grams?

1:38:07.140 --> 1:38:08.740
 Well, there we need to think a little bit

1:38:08.740 --> 1:38:10.600
 about the variation in the amount of alcohol

1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:12.280
 in different drinks across the world.

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.140
 Different countries serve different sized drinks

1:38:14.140 --> 1:38:16.720
 and have different concentrations of alcohol in those drinks.

1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:18.960
 So without going down too much of a rabbit hole

1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:21.800
 and just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with,

1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.000
 there have been studies of the percentage of alcohol

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.760
 included in different drinks and the sizes

1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:28.620
 of different drinks that are served in different countries.

1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:32.740
 And here's a kind of a patchwork of those findings.

1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:37.240
 In Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,

1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:40.360
 or one shot of liquor as it's served there tends

1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:44.180
 to include anywhere from seven to eight grams of alcohol.

1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:47.240
 In the US, one beer, which generally is 12 ounces,

1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:52.240
 if it's in a bottle, one glass of wine or a shot of liquor

1:38:52.700 --> 1:38:57.700
 tends to include about 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.

1:38:57.860 --> 1:39:02.660
 And in Russia, one drink of the various sorts

1:39:02.660 --> 1:39:05.840
 that I just described typically will have

1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:10.660
 as much as 24 grams of alcohol because of the differences

1:39:10.660 --> 1:39:14.600
 in the concentration of alcohols and the sizes of drinks

1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:16.820
 that are poured in these different countries, okay?

1:39:16.820 --> 1:39:18.200
 Of course, there are other countries in the world,

1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:19.900
 those countries are also vitally important,

1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:22.700
 but those are the ones that I extracted from the studies

1:39:22.700 --> 1:39:23.660
 that I could find.

1:39:25.180 --> 1:39:26.020
 What does this mean?

1:39:26.020 --> 1:39:28.700
 Well, what we're talking about is that for every 10 grams

1:39:28.700 --> 1:39:32.500
 of alcohol consumed, so that's one beer in the US,

1:39:32.500 --> 1:39:34.900
 maybe a little bit more than one beer in Japan,

1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:38.900
 or basically a third of a drink in Russia,

1:39:38.900 --> 1:39:43.900
 there's a 4 to 13% increase in risk of cancer.

1:39:44.900 --> 1:39:46.600
 That's pretty outrageous, right?

1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:48.380
 And you might think, wait, how could it be

1:39:48.380 --> 1:39:50.620
 that this stuff is even legal?

1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:54.020
 Well, look, as I described before, it's a toxin.

1:39:54.020 --> 1:39:57.140
 It's also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of.

1:39:57.140 --> 1:40:00.420
 I mean, in the US, at least they tried prohibition.

1:40:00.420 --> 1:40:04.580
 It certainly did lead, yes, did lead to a reduction

1:40:04.580 --> 1:40:08.020
 in alcohol-induced health disorders,

1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.500
 in particular cirrhosis of the liver.

1:40:09.500 --> 1:40:12.980
 It also led to a lot of crime because it became a substance

1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:15.020
 that a lot of people still wanted

1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:17.220
 and that people were willing to break the law

1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:20.780
 in order to provide, or I should say to sell and provide.

1:40:20.780 --> 1:40:24.200
 But the point is that the more alcohol people drink,

1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:26.500
 the greater their increase of cancer,

1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:27.620
 in particular breast cancer.

1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:29.660
 And that's because of the fact

1:40:29.660 --> 1:40:33.460
 that alcohol has these effects on cells

1:40:33.460 --> 1:40:36.540
 that include changes in gene expression.

1:40:36.540 --> 1:40:39.380
 And cancer, that is the growth of tumors,

1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:42.160
 is a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?

1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:45.500
 A tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation.

1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:47.540
 Aggregation is stuff sticking together, by the way.

1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:50.140
 Proliferation is stuff duplicating.

1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:52.980
 A proliferation and aggregation of cells

1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:56.420
 that could be a glioma, glial cells, glioma, brain tumor,

1:40:56.420 --> 1:40:57.700
 right, it could be lymphoma,

1:40:57.700 --> 1:41:00.620
 so within the lymph tissue, et cetera.

1:41:00.620 --> 1:41:03.940
 The mutations that alcohol induces to cause this

1:41:03.940 --> 1:41:05.260
 are wide ranging.

1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:07.260
 Some of those are starting to start to be understood.

1:41:07.260 --> 1:41:08.940
 For those of you that are interested in cell biology,

1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:11.500
 I'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,

1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:14.180
 again, this is super specialized

1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:15.780
 and for the aficionados only.

1:41:15.780 --> 1:41:17.180
 You don't need to know this.

1:41:17.180 --> 1:41:19.280
 The PD-1 pathway seems to be upregulated.

1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:21.840
 And we knew this from the discussion earlier,

1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:23.460
 there's a downregulation

1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:27.740
 in some of the anti-inflammatory molecules

1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:31.380
 that help suppress this proliferation of cancers.

1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:33.300
 Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in the fact

1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:37.340
 that the immune system is constantly combating cancers

1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:38.700
 that exist in us all the time.

1:41:38.700 --> 1:41:40.620
 You know, little tumors start growing

1:41:40.620 --> 1:41:42.660
 and our immune system goes and gobbles them up.

1:41:42.660 --> 1:41:44.020
 Little tumors start growing,

1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:45.860
 the immune system senses inflammation,

1:41:45.860 --> 1:41:47.300
 sends out these incredible cells,

1:41:47.300 --> 1:41:50.260
 these killers B cells and T cells and beats them up.

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:55.140
 Cancers proliferate and take hold and cause serious problems

1:41:55.140 --> 1:41:57.260
 when the proliferation of cells

1:41:57.260 --> 1:41:59.420
 exceeds the immune system's ability

1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:00.940
 to gobble up and remove those cells.

1:42:00.940 --> 1:42:02.920
 There are other mechanisms of regulating cancers,

1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:04.260
 but that's one of the primary one.

1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:07.240
 And alcohol hits it, again, it's a two hit model.

1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:11.340
 It increases tumor growth and it decreases

1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:13.420
 the sorts of molecules that suppress

1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:15.280
 and combat tumor growth.

1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:18.700
 So again, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol

1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:20.660
 can be problematic for sake of cancers,

1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:22.320
 in particular, breast cancers.

1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:26.100
 Epidemiologists and health specialists

1:42:26.100 --> 1:42:28.700
 love to try and compare different substances

1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:30.260
 in terms of how bad they are.

1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:32.280
 Rarely do they compare substances

1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:35.700
 in terms of how good they are, but sometimes they do.

1:42:35.700 --> 1:42:38.020
 And what they'll sometimes tell you

1:42:38.020 --> 1:42:39.340
 and what you can find in the literature

1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:42.620
 is that ingesting 10 to 15 grams of alcohol a day,

1:42:42.620 --> 1:42:44.380
 so that would be like one beer in the US,

1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:45.460
 one glass of wine,

1:42:45.460 --> 1:42:48.500
 is the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.

1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:53.020
 Frankly, it's hard to make that direct relationship

1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:56.020
 really stick because it's a question of

1:42:56.020 --> 1:42:57.240
 how long people inhale,

1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:00.580
 do they have a predisposition to a lung cancer, et cetera.

1:43:00.580 --> 1:43:03.420
 But even if that number is off

1:43:03.420 --> 1:43:06.660
 by plus or minus two cigarettes,

1:43:06.660 --> 1:43:09.540
 or even if that number with the equivalent

1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:12.260
 of one glass of wine equals one cigarette per day,

1:43:12.260 --> 1:43:14.440
 I think there's general consensus now

1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:18.500
 that nicotine consumed by vaping or by cigarette,

1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:22.540
 it's bad for us in terms of lung cancer

1:43:22.540 --> 1:43:24.020
 and other forms of cancer.

1:43:24.020 --> 1:43:26.500
 And for some reason, I don't know why,

1:43:26.500 --> 1:43:29.400
 because this knowledge about alcohol and cancer

1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:31.660
 and these established relationships

1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:33.880
 have been known since the late 1980s.

1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:37.620
 The first landmark paper on this was published in 1987.

1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:38.800
 I can provide a link to that paper.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:41.820
 It's actually quite interesting to read.

1:43:41.820 --> 1:43:45.240
 Well, the relationship is there

1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:47.460
 and yet we don't often hear about it, right?

1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:49.560
 In fact, before researching this episode,

1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:52.960
 I had heard before that alcohol can increase cancer risk,

1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:55.020
 but I wasn't aware of just how strong

1:43:55.020 --> 1:43:56.300
 that relationship is.

1:43:56.300 --> 1:43:58.800
 Because of the serious nature of what we're talking about

1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:01.780
 and because I would hate to be confusing

1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:03.180
 or misleading to anybody,

1:44:03.180 --> 1:44:05.760
 I want to just emphasize that this statistic,

1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:07.860
 that there is a four to 13%,

1:44:07.860 --> 1:44:09.260
 depending on which study you look at,

1:44:09.260 --> 1:44:12.460
 a four to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,

1:44:12.460 --> 1:44:13.680
 in particular breast cancer,

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:17.220
 for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,

1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:18.740
 that's 10 grams per day.

1:44:18.740 --> 1:44:20.800
 So that's one drink per day.

1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.620
 But I do want to emphasize that if that equates

1:44:25.620 --> 1:44:27.180
 to seven drinks per week

1:44:27.180 --> 1:44:29.780
 and all those seven drinks are being consumed

1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:31.160
 on Friday and Saturday,

1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:33.800
 it still averages to 10 grams per day.

1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:35.140
 And I also want to emphasize

1:44:35.140 --> 1:44:37.080
 that there are things that people can do

1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:40.260
 to at least partially offset some of the negative effects

1:44:40.260 --> 1:44:43.340
 of alcohol as it relates to predisposition

1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:46.140
 to the formation of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.

1:44:47.460 --> 1:44:49.480
 I also want to be clear before I say it

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:51.980
 that doing the things I'm about to tell you

1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:55.780
 is not a guarantee that you're not going to get cancer,

1:44:55.780 --> 1:44:59.300
 nor is it a guarantee that alcohol is not going

1:44:59.300 --> 1:45:02.420
 to lead to an increased predisposition

1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:03.860
 for certain kinds of cancers.

1:45:03.860 --> 1:45:07.220
 And the two things are consumption of folate

1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:10.420
 and other B vitamins, especially B12.

1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:13.300
 You know, the consumption of folate and B12

1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:16.980
 has been shown to decrease cancer risk

1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:19.180
 in people that ingest alcohol,

1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:21.500
 but not completely offset it.

1:45:21.500 --> 1:45:23.420
 Why that is isn't exactly clear.

1:45:23.420 --> 1:45:25.960
 It probably has something to do with the relationship

1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:29.800
 between folate and B12 and other B vitamins

1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:33.140
 in gene regulation pathways that can lead to tumor growth.

1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:37.100
 At some point soon, we will get an expert in cancer biology

1:45:37.100 --> 1:45:40.800
 and in particular in breast cancer biology on the program,

1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:42.420
 and we can ask them about this,

1:45:42.420 --> 1:45:45.180
 but I realize this is going to raise a number of questions

1:45:45.180 --> 1:45:47.360
 and maybe even cause some of you to go out there

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:50.760
 and start taking folate and other B vitamins and B12.

1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:55.760
 Not incidentally, a lot of the reported hangover supplements

1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:00.340
 and treatments include folate and B12.

1:46:00.340 --> 1:46:02.840
 I don't know if they had the cancer literature in mind

1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:06.020
 when they created those supplements and products.

1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:07.880
 I doubt they did.

1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:11.220
 Alcohol really does disrupt B vitamin pathways,

1:46:11.220 --> 1:46:14.240
 both synthesis pathways and utilization pathways.

1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:15.320
 So sometimes you'll hear,

1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:16.780
 if you get your B vitamins,

1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:20.280
 it helps you recover from hangover more quickly.

1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:22.460
 Again, the literature doesn't support that,

1:46:22.460 --> 1:46:24.540
 but also again, there aren't a lot of studies,

1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:28.100
 but more to the point as it relates to alcohol

1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:30.020
 and the formation of tumors and cancers,

1:46:30.020 --> 1:46:33.100
 it does appear that decreased folate

1:46:33.100 --> 1:46:36.740
 and other B vitamins like B12 are partially responsible

1:46:36.740 --> 1:46:40.940
 for the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk.

1:46:40.940 --> 1:46:45.720
 And it does appear that consuming adequate amounts of folate

1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:49.300
 and B12 might, again, might partially really want

1:46:49.300 --> 1:46:51.260
 to bold face and underline and highlight,

1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:54.340
 partially offset some of that increased risk.

1:46:54.340 --> 1:46:55.720
 There's an additional category

1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:58.160
 that I want to highlight, of course,

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:01.180
 and this is vitally important to state,

1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:02.580
 even though it's obvious,

1:47:02.580 --> 1:47:05.400
 which is that people who are pregnant

1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:09.100
 should absolutely not consume alcohol.

1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:13.240
 Fetal alcohol syndrome is well-known and established.

1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:14.300
 It's terrible.

1:47:14.300 --> 1:47:18.140
 Fetuses experience diminished brain development

1:47:18.140 --> 1:47:21.100
 that's often permanent, diminished limb development,

1:47:21.100 --> 1:47:23.020
 diminished organ development in the periphery,

1:47:23.020 --> 1:47:25.640
 meaning the heart, the lungs, the liver, et cetera.

1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:28.860
 Ingesting alcohol while pregnant is simply a bad idea.

1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:31.860
 And the reason I say this at all is,

1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:33.300
 first of all, it's important to include

1:47:33.300 --> 1:47:34.220
 in an episode like this,

1:47:34.220 --> 1:47:37.900
 but also because we can look at two things.

1:47:37.900 --> 1:47:39.400
 First of all, we can look at mechanism,

1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:41.980
 and then we can also look at some of the lore

1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:44.900
 that still sadly exists out there.

1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:48.400
 Let's take care of the lore that sadly exists first.

1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:50.740
 If you look online,

1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:54.460
 you will sometimes be able to find, sadly,

1:47:54.460 --> 1:47:58.500
 that some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol

1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:00.340
 are not detrimental to fetuses.

1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:02.500
 They'll say, well, champagne is safe

1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:05.340
 for a pregnant mother to drink, but beer is not.

1:48:05.340 --> 1:48:08.380
 That is absolutely categorically false.

1:48:08.380 --> 1:48:10.300
 Alcohol is alcohol.

1:48:10.300 --> 1:48:12.000
 There is no evidence whatsoever

1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:13.700
 that consuming certain types of alcohol

1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:15.580
 is safer for fetuses than others.

1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:16.620
 Alcohol is a toxin,

1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:19.140
 and the reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists

1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:21.980
 is because the ability of that toxin

1:48:21.980 --> 1:48:24.160
 to disrupt cellular processes.

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:27.300
 Remember tumor growth and the way that alcohol

1:48:27.300 --> 1:48:30.740
 can accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells,

1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:33.540
 the wrong cells, the ones you don't want to proliferate?

1:48:33.540 --> 1:48:35.380
 Well, all of embryonic development,

1:48:35.380 --> 1:48:38.340
 all of fetal development, it's not the growth of a tumor.

1:48:38.340 --> 1:48:39.940
 It's obviously the growth of an embryo,

1:48:39.940 --> 1:48:43.460
 and it's done in a very orchestrated way.

1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:45.100
 I started off studying brain development.

1:48:45.100 --> 1:48:47.740
 That's where I got my beginnings in neurobiology,

1:48:47.740 --> 1:48:50.680
 and I still teach embryology to medical students

1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:52.460
 and graduate students.

1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:56.440
 The set of coordinated processes that has to take place

1:48:56.440 --> 1:48:59.100
 from conception to birth in order to give rise

1:48:59.100 --> 1:49:03.260
 to a healthy embryo is so dynamically controlled

1:49:03.260 --> 1:49:06.700
 and so exquisitely precise with checkpoints

1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:09.300
 and recovery mechanisms and redundancy

1:49:09.300 --> 1:49:10.900
 in the genes that are expressed to make sure

1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:13.720
 that if anything goes wrong, it's repaired, et cetera.

1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:17.640
 Alcohol as a mutagen, I haven't used that word yet,

1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:21.060
 but a substance that can mutate DNA

1:49:21.060 --> 1:49:23.100
 through alterations in DNA methylation

1:49:23.100 --> 1:49:25.300
 and these checkpoints in the cell cycle.

1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:29.300
 Alcohol as a mutagen is one of the worst things

1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:31.700
 that a developing embryo can be exposed to.

1:49:31.700 --> 1:49:34.880
 And again, because it's water-soluble and fat-soluble,

1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:36.700
 ingestion of alcohol when people are pregnant

1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:39.060
 passes right to the fetus.

1:49:39.060 --> 1:49:41.540
 Now, I realize that a number of people out there

1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:42.900
 might be thinking, oh goodness,

1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:45.140
 I didn't realize I was pregnant

1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:46.900
 until a certain stage of pregnancy,

1:49:46.900 --> 1:49:50.060
 and before I realized I was ingesting alcohol.

1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:53.900
 Obviously, one can't undo what's been done,

1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:57.180
 but I want to also emphasize that fetal alcohol syndrome,

1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:59.520
 while, yes, there's a full-blown syndrome

1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:02.060
 that manifests as changes in the craniofacial development

1:50:02.060 --> 1:50:03.920
 that are very obvious, and you can look these up,

1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:05.920
 you've probably seen these before, the pictures before,

1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:08.660
 rather, it has to do with eye spacing, forehead size,

1:50:08.660 --> 1:50:11.700
 a number of other features of the craniofacial development,

1:50:11.700 --> 1:50:13.580
 and of course, stuff's going on in the brain too.

1:50:13.580 --> 1:50:15.380
 It's along a continuum.

1:50:15.380 --> 1:50:18.860
 So it is possible that some of the changes that occur

1:50:18.860 --> 1:50:22.700
 are more minor, and thankfully, the young brain,

1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:24.500
 in particular, the early postnatal brain

1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:25.600
 is incredibly plastic.

1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:26.780
 There are things that can be done

1:50:26.780 --> 1:50:28.780
 in order to help recover neural circuits

1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:31.780
 that didn't develop well, et cetera.

1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:36.220
 But even though it's somewhat obvious or should be obvious,

1:50:36.220 --> 1:50:38.600
 I really want to make clear that there's zero evidence

1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:40.300
 whatsoever that certain forms of alcohol

1:50:40.300 --> 1:50:42.460
 are safer for pregnant women to ingest than others.

1:50:42.460 --> 1:50:43.600
 Absolutely wrong.

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.500
 No one who's pregnant should be ingesting alcohol

1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:50.220
 whatsoever, and certainly, if people feel like

1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:52.300
 they can't avoid alcohol while pregnant,

1:50:52.300 --> 1:50:54.080
 they really need to work with somebody

1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:55.900
 to make sure that it just absolutely doesn't happen

1:50:55.900 --> 1:50:58.820
 because it is so detrimental to the developing fetus.

1:50:58.820 --> 1:51:00.380
 Lastly, I want to talk about the effects

1:51:00.380 --> 1:51:03.860
 of alcohol on hormones, and I want to distinguish

1:51:03.860 --> 1:51:06.420
 between low amounts of alcohol intake,

1:51:06.420 --> 1:51:07.980
 higher amounts of alcohol intake,

1:51:07.980 --> 1:51:09.940
 and again, this chronic alcohol intake

1:51:09.940 --> 1:51:13.580
 versus occasional use versus really chronic use,

1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:16.560
 meaning alcoholic or alcoholic use disorder

1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.340
 where people are drinking an immense amount

1:51:18.340 --> 1:51:20.380
 on an ongoing basis.

1:51:20.380 --> 1:51:23.140
 The literature on alcohol and hormones is quite extensive,

1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:24.020
 and there are, of course, many,

1:51:24.020 --> 1:51:25.340
 many different types of hormones.

1:51:25.340 --> 1:51:27.980
 The hormones that most often get mentioned

1:51:27.980 --> 1:51:29.820
 and talked about on this podcast are the hormones

1:51:29.820 --> 1:51:31.540
 testosterone and estrogen, which are present

1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:34.180
 in both men and women, and that in both men and women

1:51:34.180 --> 1:51:38.260
 are important for things like libido.

1:51:38.260 --> 1:51:40.320
 They're also responsible for sexual development,

1:51:40.320 --> 1:51:42.540
 actual development of the genitalia

1:51:42.540 --> 1:51:43.900
 before birth and after birth.

1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:45.180
 They're responsible, for instance,

1:51:45.180 --> 1:51:47.360
 estrogen is important for memory and cognition.

1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:49.820
 You never want to drop estrogen too low in men or women

1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:52.860
 because it can disrupt cognition and joint health, et cetera.

1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:56.820
 To keep this discussion relatively constrained,

1:51:56.820 --> 1:52:00.060
 it's fair to say that alcohol, and in particular,

1:52:00.060 --> 1:52:03.320
 the toxic metabolites of alcohol,

1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:07.640
 increase the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:10.620
 Now, this occurs in a number of different tissues.

1:52:10.620 --> 1:52:12.740
 This is not just occurring in the testes of males.

1:52:12.740 --> 1:52:14.320
 This is occurring in lots of different tissues,

1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:16.380
 and I'll refer you to a excellent review.

1:52:16.380 --> 1:52:18.300
 We'll provide a link in the show note captions.

1:52:18.300 --> 1:52:21.260
 This is a paper that was published in the year 2000,

1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:23.620
 but the data are still quite strong.

1:52:23.620 --> 1:52:26.660
 The journal is called, of all things, Alcohol.

1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:31.100
 There's, yes, literally a journal called Alcohol

1:52:31.100 --> 1:52:33.540
 for the publication of data and reviews

1:52:33.540 --> 1:52:34.900
 on alcohol and its effects.

1:52:34.900 --> 1:52:36.000
 And the title of the paper is,

1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.020
 Can Alcohol Promote Aromatization

1:52:38.020 --> 1:52:39.260
 of Androgens to Estrogens?

1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:41.640
 Aromatization is this process of the conversion

1:52:41.640 --> 1:52:44.580
 of testosterone and other androgens to estrogens

1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:46.740
 through things like aromatase enzyme.

1:52:46.740 --> 1:52:50.740
 And this is a beautiful review that describes every tissue

1:52:51.740 --> 1:52:54.820
 or near every tissue from the ovary in females

1:52:54.820 --> 1:52:58.420
 to the placenta, to the liver, to the testes,

1:52:58.420 --> 1:53:02.900
 in which alcohol can increase the aromatization

1:53:02.900 --> 1:53:04.060
 of testosterone to estrogen.

1:53:04.060 --> 1:53:06.640
 Now in females, this may be part of the reason

1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:09.740
 why there's an increase in estrogen-related cancers.

1:53:09.740 --> 1:53:12.020
 Breast cancer can be either estrogen-related

1:53:12.020 --> 1:53:13.120
 or non-estrogen-related.

1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:14.900
 There are other types of estrogen-related cancers

1:53:14.900 --> 1:53:16.720
 outside of breast cancer,

1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:19.620
 but it appears that one reason why alcohol increases

1:53:19.620 --> 1:53:22.940
 the risk of breast cancer is because of this aromatization

1:53:22.940 --> 1:53:26.560
 from, of testosterone, excuse me, to estrogen.

1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:31.560
 In males, accelerated or abnormal conversion

1:53:31.700 --> 1:53:34.100
 of testosterone to estrogen can actually lead to growth

1:53:34.100 --> 1:53:37.280
 of the breast tissue in males, so-called gynecomastia,

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:39.800
 or other effects of high estrogen,

1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:43.260
 or I should say of altered testosterone-estrogen ratios,

1:53:43.260 --> 1:53:45.400
 because that's really what's important.

1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:48.860
 And these can include things like diminished sex drive,

1:53:48.860 --> 1:53:51.560
 increased fat storage, and a number of other things

1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:55.300
 that I think most people would find to be negative effects.

1:53:55.300 --> 1:53:58.640
 I once talked about the fact that drinking alcohol

1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:01.220
 can increase the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.

1:54:01.220 --> 1:54:03.580
 I posted that online and I didn't get attacked,

1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:07.560
 but I did get criticized for the fact

1:54:07.560 --> 1:54:09.940
 that it has been shown, yes, has been shown

1:54:09.940 --> 1:54:11.780
 that small amounts of alcohol ingestion,

1:54:11.780 --> 1:54:14.140
 so five grams or so of alcohol ingestion,

1:54:14.140 --> 1:54:16.420
 this would be half a glass of wine or half a glass of beer,

1:54:16.420 --> 1:54:19.740
 at least in some studies showed increases in testosterone,

1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:22.340
 which was kind of surprising, but I should point out,

1:54:22.340 --> 1:54:25.540
 other studies have shown that alcohol ingestion

1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:29.160
 causes decreases in testosterone over time.

1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:30.640
 So there's always this issue

1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:31.620
 of whether or not you're looking at a study

1:54:31.620 --> 1:54:33.820
 of acute exposure versus chronic exposure,

1:54:33.820 --> 1:54:37.040
 one dose versus multiple doses and exposure.

1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:39.540
 I think it's fair to say,

1:54:39.540 --> 1:54:41.020
 based on my read of the literature,

1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.700
 this review and other reviews

1:54:42.700 --> 1:54:45.040
 that focus more particularly on humans,

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.200
 that regular ingestion of alcohol

1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:49.540
 is going to increase estrogen levels,

1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:50.880
 whether or not you're male or female,

1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:54.200
 and it's largely doing that through the aromatization process

1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:57.340
 by increasing the aromatase enzyme.

1:54:57.340 --> 1:54:59.040
 Yes, there's some dose dependence,

1:54:59.040 --> 1:54:59.980
 but I think if you're somebody

1:54:59.980 --> 1:55:03.220
 who's trying to optimize your testosterone to estrogen ratio,

1:55:03.220 --> 1:55:05.300
 regardless of whether or not you're male or female,

1:55:05.300 --> 1:55:07.780
 well, then most certainly you're going to want to avoid

1:55:07.780 --> 1:55:09.460
 drinking too much alcohol.

1:55:09.460 --> 1:55:11.860
 So we've covered a lot of topics and data

1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:16.620
 related to the mechanisms of alcohol, hangover, tolerance,

1:55:16.620 --> 1:55:18.180
 cancer risk, et cetera.

1:55:18.180 --> 1:55:19.980
 I acknowledge that I've mainly talked to you

1:55:19.980 --> 1:55:21.940
 about the negative effects of alcohol.

1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:26.580
 I want to acknowledge that many people enjoy alcohol

1:55:26.580 --> 1:55:30.140
 in moderation or even light drinking,

1:55:30.140 --> 1:55:32.740
 the occasional drink or the occasional two drinks,

1:55:32.740 --> 1:55:35.380
 or maybe even on average, one drink per night,

1:55:35.380 --> 1:55:37.100
 so seven drinks per week.

1:55:37.100 --> 1:55:38.660
 I'm certainly not here to tell you

1:55:38.660 --> 1:55:40.740
 what to do and what not to do.

1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:43.660
 I do find it immensely interesting, however,

1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:46.740
 that first of all, alcohol is a known toxin

1:55:46.740 --> 1:55:47.900
 to the cells of the body.

1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:49.080
 Some of you might immediately say,

1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:50.520
 well, wait, what about hormesis?

1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:52.740
 What about this phenomenon where if we regularly

1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:54.780
 ingest a toxin, it makes us stronger?

1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:57.100
 In other words, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.

1:55:57.100 --> 1:55:59.340
 Yeah, there's some reason to believe

1:55:59.340 --> 1:56:02.900
 that might be beneficial in terms of some forms

1:56:02.900 --> 1:56:06.540
 of cellular resilience, maybe, maybe, no, sorry.

1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:07.620
 It doesn't work that way.

1:56:07.620 --> 1:56:10.860
 There are processes of hormesis in which, for instance,

1:56:10.860 --> 1:56:14.660
 exposing yourself safely to increases in adrenaline

1:56:14.660 --> 1:56:17.820
 through ice baths or other things that increase adrenaline

1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:20.080
 can raise your so-called stress threshold.

1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:22.700
 But here we're talking about cellular stress

1:56:22.700 --> 1:56:24.760
 and damage to cells.

1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:27.900
 So my read of the literature, and again, this is my read,

1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:30.800
 and I invite others to provide studies,

1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:33.260
 or I would prefer actually collections of studies

1:56:33.260 --> 1:56:35.880
 that point in the direction, if they exist,

1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:39.060
 that alcohol can be beneficial.

1:56:39.060 --> 1:56:42.340
 But my read of the literature, or I should say,

1:56:42.340 --> 1:56:45.060
 my understanding of what I would call the center of mass

1:56:45.060 --> 1:56:49.620
 of the literature on alcohol is that no consumption,

1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:53.860
 zero consumption, consumption of zero ounces of alcohol

1:56:53.860 --> 1:56:55.980
 is going to be better for your health

1:56:55.980 --> 1:56:59.140
 than low to moderate consumption of alcohol.

1:56:59.140 --> 1:57:02.340
 And that low to moderate consumption of alcohol

1:57:02.340 --> 1:57:04.340
 is going to be better for you, of course,

1:57:04.340 --> 1:57:08.480
 than moderately high to high alcohol consumption

1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:12.260
 on the order of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week.

1:57:12.260 --> 1:57:15.660
 I realize that for most people listening to this,

1:57:15.660 --> 1:57:19.660
 it's probably low to moderate alcohol consumption

1:57:19.660 --> 1:57:23.040
 that is part of their standard repertoire.

1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:26.380
 And I'm not here to give you justification for doing that,

1:57:26.380 --> 1:57:28.360
 nor am I going to tell you not to do that.

1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:31.540
 I would like you to consider perhaps, however,

1:57:31.540 --> 1:57:33.920
 the negative effects that we understand

1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:34.780
 and that are documented.

1:57:34.780 --> 1:57:37.580
 For instance, the negative effects of alcohol

1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:40.480
 in the gut microbiome and the things that you can do

1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:42.580
 to better support your gut microbiome.

1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:45.000
 The negative effects on the stress system,

1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:47.140
 that HPA axis that we talked about earlier,

1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:49.580
 and the fact that even low to moderate levels

1:57:49.580 --> 1:57:52.080
 of alcohol consumption can increase our levels of stress

1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:53.860
 when we're not drinking,

1:57:53.860 --> 1:57:57.340
 and to think about acquiring some tools

1:57:57.340 --> 1:58:00.080
 and getting some proficiency with tools,

1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:01.140
 behavioral or otherwise,

1:58:01.140 --> 1:58:03.260
 that can help you with stress modulation

1:58:03.260 --> 1:58:05.940
 that don't involve alcohol consumption.

1:58:05.940 --> 1:58:08.980
 Again, the point here is to illustrate

1:58:08.980 --> 1:58:11.100
 where the problems lie with alcohol consumption,

1:58:11.100 --> 1:58:13.220
 but also what I've tried to do

1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:14.660
 is to point you to some resources

1:58:14.660 --> 1:58:17.340
 that can help offset some of those negative effects.

1:58:17.340 --> 1:58:19.380
 Will they offset all the effects?

1:58:19.380 --> 1:58:20.940
 I can't say that for sure,

1:58:20.940 --> 1:58:24.020
 but certainly taking measures

1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:25.580
 to offset some of the negative effects

1:58:25.580 --> 1:58:26.760
 of any alcohol consumption

1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:29.640
 that you might be having or doing

1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:31.500
 is going to be beneficial to you.

1:58:31.500 --> 1:58:32.740
 And those tools and protocols

1:58:32.740 --> 1:58:34.720
 are going to be health promoting in any case.

1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:03.140
 We do read all the comments.

1:59:03.140 --> 1:59:04.860
 Please also check out the sponsors mentioned

1:59:04.860 --> 1:59:06.540
 at the beginning of today's podcast

1:59:06.540 --> 1:59:08.420
 and check out Momentus Supplements,

1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:10.060
 our new partners in the supplement space,

1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:12.100
 and check out Athletic Greens.

1:59:12.100 --> 1:59:14.380
 That's the best way to support this podcast.

1:59:14.380 --> 1:59:16.620
 If you're not already following us on social media,

1:59:16.620 --> 1:59:17.940
 please do so.

1:59:17.940 --> 1:59:19.700
 We are Huberman Lab on Twitter,

1:59:19.700 --> 1:59:21.740
 and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram,

1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:25.060
 and both places I cover science and science-related tools,

1:59:25.060 --> 1:59:26.640
 some of which overlap with the content

1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:27.800
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:30.020
 but much of which is unique from the content

1:59:30.020 --> 1:59:31.560
 covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:33.260
 Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram

1:59:33.260 --> 1:59:34.900
 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:59:34.900 --> 1:59:37.820
 Please also check out our neural network monthly newsletter.

1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:41.300
 This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.

1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.600
 It also includes a lot of actionable protocols.

1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:45.660
 It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.

1:59:45.660 --> 1:59:47.820
 You go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,

1:59:47.820 --> 1:59:49.860
 go to newsletter, you supply your email,

1:59:49.860 --> 1:59:51.860
 but we do not share your email with anybody.

1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:54.780
 We have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy,

1:59:54.780 --> 1:59:56.980
 which is we do not share your email with anybody.

1:59:56.980 --> 1:59:59.500
 And the newsletter comes out once a month

1:59:59.500 --> 2:00:01.020
 and it is completely zero cost.

2:00:01.020 --> 2:00:03.060
 Again, just go to HubermanLab.com

2:00:03.060 --> 2:00:05.520
 and go to the neural network newsletter.

2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:06.540
 I'd also like to point out

2:00:06.540 --> 2:00:09.020
 that the Huberman Lab Podcast has a clips channel.

2:00:09.020 --> 2:00:13.380
 So these are brief clips, anywhere from three to 10 minutes

2:00:13.380 --> 2:00:16.960
 that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols

2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:18.860
 related to sleep, to focus,

2:00:18.860 --> 2:00:20.140
 interviews with various guests.

2:00:20.140 --> 2:00:21.520
 We talk about things like caffeine,

2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:23.960
 when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,

2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:25.220
 alcohol, when and how,

2:00:25.220 --> 2:00:28.340
 and if anyone should ingest it relative to sleep,

2:00:28.340 --> 2:00:30.940
 dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health,

2:00:30.940 --> 2:00:31.860
 and on and on,

2:00:31.860 --> 2:00:33.820
 all the things that relate to the topics

2:00:33.820 --> 2:00:35.180
 most of interest to you.

2:00:35.180 --> 2:00:37.820
 You can find that easily by going to YouTube,

2:00:37.820 --> 2:00:40.740
 look for Huberman Lab Clips in the search area,

2:00:40.740 --> 2:00:41.580
 and it will take you there.

2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:43.940
 Subscribe, and we are constantly updating those

2:00:43.940 --> 2:00:44.780
 with new clips.

2:00:44.780 --> 2:00:46.180
 This is especially useful, I believe,

2:00:46.180 --> 2:00:48.220
 for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes

2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:49.820
 or you're still working through the back catalog

2:00:49.820 --> 2:00:50.900
 of Huberman Lab Podcasts,

2:00:50.900 --> 2:00:53.020
 which admittedly can be rather long.

2:00:53.020 --> 2:00:55.340
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:00:55.340 --> 2:00:57.140
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:00:57.140 --> 2:01:02.140
 I'll see you next time.
