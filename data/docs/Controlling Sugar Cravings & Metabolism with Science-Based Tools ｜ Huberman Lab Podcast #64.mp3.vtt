00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.160 --> 00:12.880
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.880 --> 00:14.680
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.840
 Today, we are going to discuss sugar,

00:16.840 --> 00:18.960
 in particular, how our nervous system regulates

00:18.960 --> 00:22.100
 our sugar intake and our seeking of sugar.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.280
 We're also going to discuss how sugar

00:24.280 --> 00:25.800
 regulates our nervous system.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.240
 And as you'll soon learn,

00:27.240 --> 00:29.040
 sugar really impacts our brain and body

00:29.040 --> 00:30.920
 by two main mechanisms.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.560
 One of those mechanisms is based on the sweet taste

00:33.560 --> 00:35.940
 of sugar, which itself is rewarding.

00:35.940 --> 00:37.640
 Even if you're not much of a sweet tooth,

00:37.640 --> 00:39.040
 I confess I'm not,

00:39.040 --> 00:43.080
 most people enjoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.880
 And the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms

00:46.880 --> 00:48.460
 is strongly reinforcing,

00:48.460 --> 00:50.780
 meaning it triggers the activation of neurons,

00:50.780 --> 00:52.280
 nerve cells in the brain and body

00:52.280 --> 00:56.040
 that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.520
 Incidentally, sweet tastes also make us want

00:58.520 --> 01:01.120
 to eat more of other substances as well.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.920
 You may be familiar with that phenomenon.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.800
 Now, sugar also triggers mechanisms in the brain and body

01:05.800 --> 01:09.680
 based on its nutritive content independent of its sweetness.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.000
 What that means is that the actual caloric content

01:14.000 --> 01:16.800
 and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system

01:16.800 --> 01:19.880
 at a subconscious level without your awareness

01:19.880 --> 01:22.860
 also impacts your craving and seeking of sugar

01:22.860 --> 01:24.460
 and other foods.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.480
 Today, we are going to discuss what happens

01:26.480 --> 01:30.040
 when you ingest sugar in terms of your body's reaction

01:30.040 --> 01:31.640
 and your brain's reaction.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.020
 We're also going to talk about what happens

01:33.020 --> 01:35.360
 when you don't ingest enough sugar.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.600
 Because as it turns out,

01:36.600 --> 01:39.300
 sugar is such a powerful fuel for the brain

01:39.300 --> 01:42.440
 that under conditions where people don't ingest enough sugar

01:42.440 --> 01:44.360
 or where their so-called blood glucose,

01:44.360 --> 01:46.960
 which is basically blood sugar of a particular form

01:46.960 --> 01:50.660
 gets too low, their neurons don't function as well.

01:50.660 --> 01:53.480
 That said, there are conditions of very low blood sugar

01:53.480 --> 01:56.180
 in which neurons can function even better.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.560
 So today we're going to talk about the ins and outs,

01:58.560 --> 01:59.960
 the ups and downs of sugar

01:59.960 --> 02:01.440
 as it relates to your nervous system.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.900
 And by the end of this episode,

02:02.900 --> 02:05.320
 I'm confident that you have a much clearer picture

02:05.320 --> 02:08.560
 as to how much sugar you should be ingesting,

02:08.560 --> 02:10.400
 whether or not you should avoid sugars

02:10.400 --> 02:11.680
 that you're currently eating,

02:11.680 --> 02:14.300
 and you will certainly understand much, much more

02:14.300 --> 02:17.740
 about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on,

02:17.740 --> 02:19.720
 which I'm certain will allow you to make

02:19.720 --> 02:22.560
 better informed choices about the foods you eat and avoid

02:22.560 --> 02:25.280
 toward mental health, physical health, and performance.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.940
 I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events

02:27.940 --> 02:28.940
 this May.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.680
 The first live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington

02:31.680 --> 02:33.160
 on May 17th.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.800
 The second live event will be hosted in Portland, Oregon

02:35.800 --> 02:37.160
 on May 18th.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.160
 Both are part of a lecture series entitled

02:39.160 --> 02:40.740
 The Brain-Body Contract,

02:40.740 --> 02:43.800
 during which I will discuss science and science-based tools

02:43.800 --> 02:46.440
 for mental health, physical health, and performance.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.840
 I should point out that while some of the material

02:48.840 --> 02:51.520
 I'll cover will overlap with information covered here

02:51.520 --> 02:53.160
 on the Huberman Lab podcast

02:53.160 --> 02:54.980
 and on various social media posts,

02:54.980 --> 02:56.640
 most of the information I will cover

02:56.640 --> 02:59.180
 is going to be distinct from information covered

02:59.180 --> 03:01.040
 on the podcast or elsewhere.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.560
 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

03:03.560 --> 03:04.920
 Portland on May 18th.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.000
 You can access tickets by going to HubermanLab.com slash tour

03:09.000 --> 03:10.480
 and I hope to see you there.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.000
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:13.000 --> 03:15.600
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.480
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:17.480 --> 03:20.040
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:20.040 --> 03:22.680
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.960
 In keeping with that theme,

03:23.960 --> 03:26.720
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.720
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.000
 Thesis makes what are called nootropics,

03:31.000 --> 03:32.760
 which means smart drugs.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.080
 Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.720
 I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that

03:38.720 --> 03:40.640
 I don't believe that there's any one substance

03:40.640 --> 03:43.720
 or collection of substances that can make us smarter.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.080
 I do believe based on science however,

03:46.080 --> 03:47.640
 that there are particular neural circuits

03:47.640 --> 03:50.180
 and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,

03:50.180 --> 03:53.880
 more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.280
 That's just the way that the brain works.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.800
 Different neural circuits for different brain states.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.160
 And so the idea of a nootropic

03:59.160 --> 04:00.980
 that's just going to make us smarter all around

04:00.980 --> 04:04.240
 fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things, right?

04:04.240 --> 04:06.280
 If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math,

04:06.280 --> 04:08.480
 you're doing accounting, a different part of the day,

04:08.480 --> 04:09.340
 you need to be creative.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.540
 These are all different brain processes.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.040
 Thesis understands this.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.400
 And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company

04:15.400 --> 04:18.680
 to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.240
 They only use the highest quality ingredients,

04:20.240 --> 04:21.580
 which of course is essential.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.260
 Some of those I've talked about on the podcast,

04:23.260 --> 04:27.160
 things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.240
 They give you the ability to try several different blends

04:29.240 --> 04:30.480
 over the course of a month,

04:30.480 --> 04:32.240
 discover which nootropics work best

04:32.240 --> 04:35.520
 for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.440
 And with that personalization,

04:37.440 --> 04:40.360
 design a kit of nootropics that's ideal

04:40.360 --> 04:42.820
 for the different brain and body states you want to access.

04:42.820 --> 04:45.120
 I've been using thesis for more than six months now,

04:45.120 --> 04:47.080
 and I can confidently say that the nootropics

04:47.080 --> 04:48.720
 have been a total game changer.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.400
 My go-to formula is the clarity formula,

04:51.400 --> 04:54.560
 or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.600
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

04:56.600 --> 04:59.520
 go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

04:59.520 --> 05:00.520
 take a three minute quiz,

05:00.520 --> 05:02.520
 and thesis will send you four different formulas

05:02.520 --> 05:04.160
 to try in your first month.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.320
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

05:09.980 --> 05:12.560
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,

05:12.560 --> 05:14.400
 now called AG1.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.920
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

05:15.920 --> 05:18.360
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.280
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

05:21.280 --> 05:23.720
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.400
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

05:25.400 --> 05:26.840
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

05:26.840 --> 05:29.120
 once or twice a day is that it helps me cover

05:29.120 --> 05:30.880
 all of my basic nutritional needs.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.380
 It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.380
 In addition, it has probiotics,

05:35.380 --> 05:38.000
 which are vital for microbiome health.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.840
 I've done a couple of episodes now

05:39.840 --> 05:41.760
 on the so-called gut microbiome

05:41.760 --> 05:44.540
 and the ways in which the microbiome interacts

05:44.540 --> 05:47.600
 with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,

05:47.600 --> 05:49.760
 and essentially with every biological system

05:49.760 --> 05:52.520
 relevant to health throughout your brain and body.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.320
 With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
 the minerals I need,

05:55.320 --> 05:58.100
 and the probiotics to support my microbiome.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.480
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:59.480 --> 06:02.120
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:02.120 --> 06:03.600
 and claim a special offer.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.360
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

06:05.360 --> 06:07.120
 which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

06:07.120 --> 06:08.240
 while you're on the road,

06:08.240 --> 06:11.520
 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.880
 There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3

06:13.880 --> 06:16.120
 is essential for various aspects of our brain

06:16.120 --> 06:19.080
 and body health, even if we're getting a lot of sunshine.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.480
 Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.900
 and K2 is also important because it regulates things

06:23.900 --> 06:26.280
 like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,

06:26.280 --> 06:27.440
 and so on.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.240
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:30.240 --> 06:32.720
 to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs

06:32.720 --> 06:35.420
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.400
 Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.040
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:41.040 --> 06:43.640
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:43.640 --> 06:45.220
 to help you better understand your body

06:45.220 --> 06:47.120
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.880
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

06:49.880 --> 06:52.220
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:52.220 --> 06:54.280
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:54.280 --> 06:56.800
 can only be assessed with a quality blood test.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.160
 What's unique about InsideTracker

06:58.160 --> 07:00.680
 is that while there are a lot of different tests out there

07:00.680 --> 07:03.360
 for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,

07:03.360 --> 07:05.340
 with InsideTracker, you get the numbers back

07:05.340 --> 07:06.520
 in terms of your levels,

07:06.520 --> 07:08.520
 but they also give you very clear directives

07:08.520 --> 07:11.220
 in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation

07:11.220 --> 07:13.860
 that can help you bring those values into the ranges

07:13.860 --> 07:15.920
 that are best for you and your health goals.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.180
 And that's very different than a lot of the other programs

07:18.180 --> 07:19.160
 where you get a lot of information,

07:19.160 --> 07:21.320
 but you don't really know what to do with that information.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.000
 InsideTracker makes that all very easy to understand

07:24.000 --> 07:25.240
 and very actionable

07:25.240 --> 07:28.600
 based on the very easy to use dashboard at InsideTracker.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.040
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

07:30.040 --> 07:32.600
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:32.600 --> 07:35.240

07:35.240 --> 07:37.560
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.280
 Okay, let's talk about sugar.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.600
 Let's talk about how sugar impacts your brain

07:41.600 --> 07:43.760
 and how your brain impacts your pursuit

07:43.760 --> 07:46.280
 or your avoidance of sugar.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.400
 Let's get a few things out of the way first.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.160
 The first thing is that there's nothing inherently bad

07:51.160 --> 07:52.280
 about sugar.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.360
 I know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays,

07:55.360 --> 07:57.640
 and indeed you're going to hear over and over again

07:57.640 --> 08:01.300
 during this podcast that consuming a lot of refined sugars,

08:01.300 --> 08:03.640
 in particular high fructose corn syrup,

08:03.640 --> 08:07.380
 is known to have a very large number of bad effects

08:07.380 --> 08:08.280
 on the brain and body.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.440
 I don't know that there's anyone

08:09.440 --> 08:11.640
 that really debates that anymore.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.160
 Even if we just agree,

08:13.160 --> 08:16.440
 and I think we should all agree on the so-called

08:16.440 --> 08:18.760
 calories in, calories out principle, right?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.340
 It's a principle of thermodynamics

08:20.340 --> 08:23.400
 that if we ingest more energy than we burn,

08:23.400 --> 08:24.520
 we are going to gain weight.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.400
 If we ingest less energy than we burn,

08:27.400 --> 08:29.120
 we are generally going to lose weight.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.360
 And if the two things are in balance,

08:31.360 --> 08:34.340
 ingestion and burning of energy,

08:34.340 --> 08:36.560
 well then we're going to maintain weight.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.260
 So everyone agrees on that.

08:38.260 --> 08:39.120
 I agree on that.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.640
 But beyond that, there are a number of ways

08:41.640 --> 08:43.120
 in which particular nutrients,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.800
 in the case of today's episode, sugar,

08:45.800 --> 08:48.400
 impact the way that the brain works,

08:48.400 --> 08:52.360
 such that we tend to seek out more of particular nutrients.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.700
 For instance, if we eat sugar,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.360
 there are two or at least two mechanisms

08:57.360 --> 08:59.480
 by which we will crave more sugar.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.140
 I think most people are aware of that experience,

09:01.140 --> 09:03.660
 but today I'm going to explain exactly how that works.

09:03.660 --> 09:06.560
 But also that when we ingest sugar,

09:06.560 --> 09:08.200
 it has a bunch of different effects

09:08.200 --> 09:10.920
 on the way that our neural circuits work

09:10.920 --> 09:13.540
 that can allow us to be more or less focused,

09:13.540 --> 09:16.280
 more or less agitated, more or less happy,

09:16.280 --> 09:19.720
 more or less depressed in some cases.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.280
 So today, as we explore this thing we're calling sugar,

09:22.280 --> 09:24.640
 we're going to explore that mainly in the context

09:24.640 --> 09:26.000
 of the nervous system,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.080
 but also in the context of how the nervous system regulates

09:29.080 --> 09:31.240
 many, many functions and behaviors

09:31.240 --> 09:33.300
 that are important to all of you.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.420
 Your ability to think, your ability to exercise,

09:35.420 --> 09:37.320
 your ability to gain weight, lose weight,

09:37.320 --> 09:39.620
 whatever your goals might happen to be.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.800
 Sugar plays a critical role in achieving those goals.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.400
 And in some cases, if you're ingesting too much

09:45.400 --> 09:47.160
 at the wrong times or the wrong forms,

09:47.160 --> 09:49.580
 sugar can actually impede those goals.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.580
 In fact, sugar can prevent all the right behaviors

09:52.580 --> 09:55.440
 from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.960
 So today we are going to place sugar

09:56.960 --> 09:59.040
 into its proper context.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.100
 The way I want to start off by doing that

10:01.100 --> 10:04.240
 is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat

10:04.240 --> 10:06.800
 and a little bit of what the brain does

10:06.800 --> 10:09.440
 to respond to those events.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.860
 So what happens when we eat?

10:10.860 --> 10:14.480
 Well, I've done an entire episode on metabolism.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.400
 So if you're interested in the full cascade of hormonal

10:18.400 --> 10:20.820
 and neural events that occurs when we eat,

10:20.820 --> 10:22.360
 please check out that episode.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.000
 But for sake of today's discussion,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.900
 let's just take a, what I call top contour view

10:26.900 --> 10:30.080
 of the hormonal response to ingesting food.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.720
 Now, anytime we eat, that is the consequence

10:32.720 --> 10:35.960
 of a number of things that happened before we ate.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.480
 There's a hormone in our brain and body called ghrelin,

10:38.480 --> 10:40.960
 spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.040
 Ghrelin is a hormone that increases

10:44.040 --> 10:47.120
 depending on how long it's been since we ate last, okay?

10:47.120 --> 10:49.720
 So the longer it's been since we had a meal,

10:49.720 --> 10:52.640
 ghrelin levels are going to be higher and higher and higher.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.320
 And it essentially makes us hungry

10:54.320 --> 10:56.760
 by interacting with particular neurons

10:56.760 --> 10:57.920
 in an area of the brain

10:57.920 --> 11:00.360
 called the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus

11:00.360 --> 11:03.760
 and some other areas as well, like the lateral hypothalamus.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.400
 You don't need to know the names of those brain areas,

11:05.400 --> 11:08.340
 but if you'd like to know them, there they are.

11:08.340 --> 11:11.680
 Ghrelin increases, it tends to make us hungry.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.480
 And then when we eat,

11:13.480 --> 11:16.480
 typically what happens is ghrelin levels go down.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.220
 So it's a very logical system.

11:18.220 --> 11:22.160
 Now, when we eat, assuming that we eat carbohydrates,

11:22.160 --> 11:24.960
 but even if we just eat some protein and some fats,

11:24.960 --> 11:27.440
 we will experience a slight,

11:27.440 --> 11:31.020
 or in some cases, a large rise in blood glucose.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.680
 Blood glucose is simply blood sugar.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.380
 And the body and brain,

11:36.380 --> 11:38.480
 we should say particular the nervous system

11:38.480 --> 11:42.260
 doesn't function well if blood sugar is too high or too low.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.320
 So as a consequence, we have another hormone,

11:44.320 --> 11:45.640
 which is released from the pancreas,

11:45.640 --> 11:46.800
 which is called insulin,

11:46.800 --> 11:49.640
 which helps regulate the amount of glucose

11:49.640 --> 11:50.600
 in the bloodstream.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.880
 So even if you were to ingest an entire cup,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.040
 an eight ounce cup of pure table sugar,

11:56.040 --> 11:58.640
 which would send your blood glucose very, very high,

11:58.640 --> 12:00.500
 assuming that you have a normal insulin response,

12:00.500 --> 12:02.320
 that you're not diabetic,

12:02.320 --> 12:04.480
 that insulin response would help clamp

12:04.480 --> 12:06.160
 that blood glucose level

12:06.160 --> 12:09.720
 so that it did not cause damage to your brain and body.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.280
 Because if blood sugar goes too high,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.120
 it's actually toxic to neurons

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
 and other cells of your body can kill them off.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.280
 And neurons of the central nervous system,

12:17.280 --> 12:18.400
 meaning the brain and spinal cord,

12:18.400 --> 12:20.300
 once they are dead, they do not come back.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.540
 So your biological systems understand this

12:23.540 --> 12:25.240
 at a biological level that is,

12:25.240 --> 12:28.600
 and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar

12:28.600 --> 12:33.500
 by keeping insulin around in order to clamp blood glucose.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.680
 Diabetics, we call them type one diabetics

12:35.680 --> 12:38.480
 who don't make insulin have to take insulin when they eat,

12:38.480 --> 12:39.600
 in particular, when they eat foods

12:39.600 --> 12:40.940
 that raise their blood sugar,

12:40.940 --> 12:42.960
 specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity

12:42.960 --> 12:45.400
 and the other deleterious effects of high blood sugar.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.340
 Okay, so ghrelin is a hormone that goes up

12:47.340 --> 12:49.060
 the longer it's been since we've eaten.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.200
 It tends to stimulate hunger.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.640
 When we eat, ghrelin is suppressed.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.500
 Blood glucose typically goes up,

12:55.500 --> 12:59.260
 especially when we eat a carbohydrate containing meal.

12:59.260 --> 13:02.420
 When blood glucose goes up, it's regulated in the body,

13:02.420 --> 13:04.720
 meaning its peaks and its valleys

13:04.720 --> 13:06.620
 are more or less smoothed out,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.400
 and that glucose is sequestered,

13:08.400 --> 13:10.980
 it's taken away where it needs to be taken away,

13:10.980 --> 13:13.360
 and in certain locations, it's delivered to cells

13:13.360 --> 13:15.940
 so that those cells can use the glucose.

13:15.940 --> 13:19.200
 Now, one of the chief organs for glucose utilization

13:19.200 --> 13:20.580
 is the brain.

13:20.580 --> 13:23.760
 Neurons are tremendously metabolically active,

13:23.760 --> 13:28.760
 and their preferred mode of metabolism is glucose metabolism.

13:28.820 --> 13:32.000
 In other words, neurons basically run on sugar,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.640
 which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar,

13:34.640 --> 13:37.820
 as you'll see today, there are states of mind and body,

13:37.820 --> 13:39.500
 for instance, fasted states,

13:39.500 --> 13:42.540
 in which people report having immense amounts

13:42.540 --> 13:43.860
 of mental clarity,

13:43.860 --> 13:46.340
 and their blood glucose is actually quite low.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.180
 So it is simply not the case

13:48.180 --> 13:49.980
 that the more sugar that you ingest,

13:49.980 --> 13:51.700
 the better that your brain will function,

13:51.700 --> 13:53.920
 but it is the case that for most people,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.840
 meaning people who are not on a ketogenic

13:55.840 --> 13:57.320
 or very low carbohydrate diet,

13:57.320 --> 13:59.460
 they're not adapted to low carbohydrate diets,

13:59.460 --> 14:02.060
 that neurons in their brain and body

14:02.060 --> 14:04.060
 are using glucose in order to function.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.300
 That's what allows those neurons

14:05.300 --> 14:06.900
 to fire electrical potentials,

14:06.900 --> 14:08.520
 that's how we refer to it, firing,

14:08.520 --> 14:11.060
 meaning sending electrical signals down their length

14:11.060 --> 14:13.220
 to communicate with other neurons.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.440
 To illustrate just how important glucose is

14:15.440 --> 14:16.900
 for brain function,

14:16.900 --> 14:20.320
 I'd like to describe a study that just recently came out

14:20.320 --> 14:23.100
 that sits on a long history of similar studies,

14:23.100 --> 14:25.540
 but the one that just came out is particularly interesting.

14:25.540 --> 14:29.980
 Now, I want to point out that unless I say otherwise,

14:29.980 --> 14:32.780
 I'm going to refer to typical diets,

14:32.780 --> 14:35.660
 meaning I have to believe that most people out there

14:35.660 --> 14:37.940
 are ingesting some starch or carbohydrate.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.120
 I do realize there are people

14:39.120 --> 14:41.140
 following very low carbohydrate diets

14:41.140 --> 14:42.660
 or moderately carbohydrate diets,

14:42.660 --> 14:43.940
 I even know that there's some folks out there

14:43.940 --> 14:45.560
 who are on the so-called carnivore diet,

14:45.560 --> 14:48.540
 they only eat meat and organs, maybe a little fruit,

14:48.540 --> 14:49.580
 but I'm going to assume

14:49.580 --> 14:51.940
 that the vast majority of people listening

14:51.940 --> 14:55.100
 ingest proteins and carbohydrates.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.780
 So unless I say ketogenic,

14:56.780 --> 14:59.860
 or I emphasize ketosis itself, which I will,

14:59.860 --> 15:01.420
 I'm referring to a kind of typical diet

15:01.420 --> 15:04.540
 where people are consuming fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.

15:04.540 --> 15:07.700
 I count myself as one such individual.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.020
 At some point, I might try the carnivore diet, who knows,

15:10.020 --> 15:12.740
 I might try a pure vegan diet, who knows,

15:12.740 --> 15:15.760
 but for my entire life up until now, I'm 46 years old,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.340
 I've been a proud omnivore, meaning I've tried

15:18.340 --> 15:22.060
 to eat high quality, as much as I can, unprocessed foods,

15:22.060 --> 15:23.940
 I try and really avoid highly processed foods,

15:23.940 --> 15:26.220
 but I do eat from those three macronutrient groups,

15:26.220 --> 15:28.180
 proteins, carbohydrates, and fats,

15:28.180 --> 15:30.860
 and I'm going to assume that most of you do as well.

15:30.860 --> 15:35.220
 The study I'd like to emphasize recorded from neurons,

15:35.220 --> 15:38.460
 nerve cells in the brain, in particular,

15:38.460 --> 15:41.700
 in the part of the brain that responds to visual images,

15:41.700 --> 15:43.180
 a so-called visual cortex,

15:43.180 --> 15:47.300
 and neurons in the visual cortex are beautifully tuned,

15:47.300 --> 15:50.960
 as we say, to particular features of what we see.

15:52.020 --> 15:55.020
 The primary example of this, the kind of classic example,

15:55.020 --> 15:57.580
 is if you put a little electrode next to a neuron

15:57.580 --> 15:59.780
 in your visual cortex, or if we put you

15:59.780 --> 16:03.060
 into an fMRI scanner machine,

16:03.060 --> 16:04.580
 which can detect neural activity,

16:04.580 --> 16:08.900
 and I were to show you a bunch of just little lines,

16:08.900 --> 16:10.780
 bars of light, they could be dark bars of light,

16:10.780 --> 16:12.540
 they could be light bars of light

16:13.420 --> 16:15.640
 on a screen in front of you, so some would be vertical,

16:15.640 --> 16:18.360
 some will be horizontal, some will be at 45 degrees,

16:18.360 --> 16:23.140
 what we would see is that some neurons respond best,

16:23.140 --> 16:25.740
 meaning they fire a lot of electrical activity

16:25.740 --> 16:28.740
 to vertical lines, other ones respond to horizontal lines,

16:28.740 --> 16:31.620
 and others respond to 45 degree lines.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.220
 And this so-called orientation tuning,

16:34.220 --> 16:36.060
 meaning because of the orientation of the line,

16:36.060 --> 16:39.280
 is a cardinal classic feature of the way

16:39.280 --> 16:41.140
 that your visual system is built.

16:41.140 --> 16:44.980
 And everything that you see, whether it's a face or a dog

16:44.980 --> 16:47.820
 or a cat or a landscape, is built up

16:47.820 --> 16:51.140
 from these very simple neuron responses.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.580
 In other words, when you look at a face,

16:53.580 --> 16:56.140
 there are neurons deep in the brain that respond to faces,

16:56.140 --> 16:58.500
 but the only reason that those neurons can respond

16:58.500 --> 17:00.660
 to those faces is because they receive signals

17:00.660 --> 17:02.800
 from neurons in your visual cortex,

17:02.800 --> 17:04.460
 some of which respond to vertical lines,

17:04.460 --> 17:06.100
 some of which respond to horizontal lines,

17:06.100 --> 17:08.260
 and some of which respond to 45 degree lines,

17:08.260 --> 17:10.020
 and all of those are built up

17:10.020 --> 17:11.980
 in what we call a hierarchical representation,

17:11.980 --> 17:13.140
 which is fancy language for it,

17:13.140 --> 17:15.700
 those are the building blocks by which you see a face

17:15.700 --> 17:16.660
 and you recognize a face.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.140
 And it's really an amazing phenomenon,

17:18.140 --> 17:19.740
 it happens very, very fast,

17:19.740 --> 17:21.420
 you never notice that you're doing this,

17:21.420 --> 17:22.340
 but everything is built up

17:22.340 --> 17:26.060
 from these fundamental orientation tuned neurons.

17:26.060 --> 17:30.080
 Now, orientation tuned neurons are so fundamental

17:30.080 --> 17:31.820
 that they are the building blocks

17:31.820 --> 17:34.900
 by which you make up all other things that you see,

17:34.900 --> 17:35.740
 it's the way you read,

17:35.740 --> 17:38.060
 it's the way that you recognize faces, as I mentioned,

17:38.060 --> 17:39.060
 and everything else.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.180
 Experimentally, it's quite straightforward

17:43.180 --> 17:47.180
 to measure how sharply tuned one of these neurons is.

17:47.180 --> 17:50.300
 In other words, if I were to show you a vertical line

17:50.300 --> 17:51.700
 and find a neuron in your brain

17:51.700 --> 17:53.600
 that responds to vertical lines,

17:53.600 --> 17:57.460
 I could also ask whether or not that neuron fires

17:57.460 --> 17:59.100
 any electrical activity in response

17:59.100 --> 18:02.120
 to a line that's not quite vertical,

18:02.120 --> 18:04.140
 maybe just 10 degrees off vertical,

18:04.140 --> 18:06.060
 or 20 degrees, or 30 degrees.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.680
 And what I eventually would find

18:07.680 --> 18:10.980
 is that that neuron was orientation tuned

18:10.980 --> 18:13.060
 over a particular range of angles,

18:13.060 --> 18:15.240
 it's not only going to respond to vertical lines,

18:15.240 --> 18:16.580
 it's also going to respond to lines

18:16.580 --> 18:19.300
 that are about 10 degrees off vertical in either side,

18:19.300 --> 18:22.240
 but probably not much more, maybe 20,

18:22.240 --> 18:25.020
 but usually it's going to be anywhere from vertical

18:25.020 --> 18:27.140
 to just tilted slightly, okay?

18:28.940 --> 18:30.340
 In the recent experiment

18:30.340 --> 18:31.800
 that was published in the journal Neuron,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.880
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,

18:33.880 --> 18:36.180
 the authors asked a really interesting question.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.940
 They asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning,

18:38.940 --> 18:41.940
 the precision of orientation tuning of these neurons

18:41.940 --> 18:44.780
 is dependent on blood glucose level.

18:44.780 --> 18:47.080
 So just to cut to the chase, to give you the answer,

18:47.080 --> 18:51.200
 what they found is that when subjects are well-fed,

18:51.200 --> 18:53.180
 neurons that responded to vertical

18:53.180 --> 18:55.020
 responded very strongly to vertical,

18:55.020 --> 18:57.820
 but not very much at all to other angles

18:57.820 --> 18:59.780
 of what we call stimuli,

18:59.780 --> 19:02.120
 to lines that are 10 degrees or 20 degrees off.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.360
 If they looked at neurons that were primarily tuned, right?

19:06.360 --> 19:08.280
 That preferred horizontal lines,

19:08.280 --> 19:09.740
 they found the same thing, okay?

19:09.740 --> 19:11.380
 So it wasn't something unique to vertical lines.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.660
 What they basically found was the sharpness,

19:13.660 --> 19:16.500
 the precision of tuning of neurons in the brain

19:16.500 --> 19:19.820
 was best when subjects were fed.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.880
 And conversely, when subjects were fasted,

19:22.880 --> 19:25.580
 the orientation tuning of these neurons

19:25.580 --> 19:27.620
 became much broader.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.020
 What it meant was that a neuron

19:29.020 --> 19:30.980
 that normally would only respond to vertical

19:30.980 --> 19:33.740
 now responded to other angles of lines as well.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.260
 You might say, well, that's great, right?

19:35.260 --> 19:37.060
 These neurons that at one point could only do one thing

19:37.060 --> 19:39.900
 are now tuned to other things, but it's not so great

19:39.900 --> 19:43.580
 because what that means is that in the fasted state,

19:43.580 --> 19:47.480
 your perception of the outside world is actually distorted.

19:47.480 --> 19:51.240
 It's blurred, it's not as precise as it is when you're fed.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.420
 And when I say fed,

19:52.420 --> 19:55.500
 what I really mean is when glucose is available to neurons.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.380
 Now, for some of you, maybe many of you,

19:58.380 --> 20:01.340
 and including myself, intermittent fasting

20:01.340 --> 20:04.180
 or some variant thereof is actually a state that I like.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.220
 It allows me to focus.

20:05.220 --> 20:06.920
 For instance, as I mentioned before,

20:06.920 --> 20:08.140
 and even earlier in this podcast,

20:08.140 --> 20:11.660
 I tend to eat my first meal sometime around 11 a.m.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.780
 and then I generally eat my last meal

20:13.780 --> 20:15.020
 sometime around 8 p.m.,

20:15.020 --> 20:16.580
 plus or minus an hour on either side.

20:16.580 --> 20:17.620
 I'm not super strict about it.

20:17.620 --> 20:18.980
 On occasion, I'll wake up really hungry

20:18.980 --> 20:20.500
 and I'll eat something before 11 a.m.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.900
 I'm not super strict about this intermittent fasting thing.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.260
 It just seems to be how my appetite works best

20:26.260 --> 20:27.700
 given my schedule, et cetera.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.900
 In the morning, I tend to be most focused

20:31.900 --> 20:35.220
 and I always associate that with the fact that I was fasted.

20:35.220 --> 20:37.140
 I just water and some caffeine

20:37.140 --> 20:39.420
 about 90 minutes after waking up, I drink my caffeine,

20:39.420 --> 20:41.780
 but I hydrate from the time I get up, et cetera, et cetera.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.740
 And I know a lot of other people

20:43.740 --> 20:45.820
 have had the experience of being fasted

20:45.820 --> 20:48.460
 and feeling like they have a lot of mental clarity.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.300
 When you are in a fasted state,

20:50.300 --> 20:52.980
 typically you're going to use fuels

20:52.980 --> 20:54.820
 that are available to the neurons

20:54.820 --> 20:57.900
 based on your intake of food the day before,

20:57.900 --> 20:59.700
 maybe you're using some glycogen,

20:59.700 --> 21:01.260
 maybe you're using some fat,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.220
 maybe you're using some blood sugar

21:03.220 --> 21:06.100
 that's derived from other storage sites in the body.

21:06.100 --> 21:09.960
 You don't actually use fat as a fuel source for neurons

21:09.960 --> 21:11.500
 under typical conditions,

21:11.500 --> 21:13.800
 but there are ways in which proteins and fats

21:13.800 --> 21:16.060
 and glycogen, et cetera are converted

21:16.060 --> 21:18.140
 into fuel that neurons can use.

21:18.140 --> 21:19.660
 What's interesting about this study

21:19.660 --> 21:23.240
 is that the study says that when well fed,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.820
 meaning when blood glucose sugar

21:25.820 --> 21:30.460
 is at a properly elevated level in the bloodstream,

21:30.460 --> 21:32.160
 it can be delivered to the brain

21:32.160 --> 21:34.100
 in a way that allows neurons to work best,

21:34.100 --> 21:35.860
 which is really all just to underscore

21:35.860 --> 21:36.900
 the point that I made earlier,

21:36.900 --> 21:38.300
 which is that your nervous system

21:38.300 --> 21:41.880
 is extremely metabolically demanding and it loves glucose.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.100
 Neurons love glucose.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.980
 So the takeaway from this study

21:45.980 --> 21:47.980
 is not that you should avoid fasting.

21:47.980 --> 21:48.920
 The takeaway from this study

21:48.920 --> 21:51.300
 is that there are elements of the fasted state,

21:51.300 --> 21:52.540
 in particular the elevations

21:52.540 --> 21:54.420
 and things like epinephrine and norepinephrine,

21:54.420 --> 21:56.640
 also called adrenaline and noradrenaline,

21:56.640 --> 21:59.180
 that can give us this kind of clarity of mind

21:59.180 --> 22:01.520
 that many people are pursuing when they fast.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.380
 That's kind of one of the reasons a lot of people fast.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.500
 They like the way that they feel mentally and physically.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.500
 But I think it's only fair to point out

22:09.500 --> 22:11.660
 that glucose is the preferred source of fuel

22:11.660 --> 22:12.500
 for the brain.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.180
 And this study that I mentioned

22:14.180 --> 22:16.220
 is one of many studies that have explored

22:16.220 --> 22:18.820
 how nutritional status or blood glucose status

22:18.820 --> 22:20.940
 in the brain and body influence

22:20.940 --> 22:23.260
 neuronal tuning and neuronal function.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.900
 And it really points to the fact that ultimately,

22:26.900 --> 22:31.020
 your brain as an organ is a glucose consuming machine.

22:31.020 --> 22:36.020
 Now, when you eat a food, that food is broken down

22:36.340 --> 22:37.660
 and if it contains carbohydrates,

22:37.660 --> 22:39.420
 it's going to be converted into glucose.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.100
 And that glucose can't get directly

22:41.100 --> 22:42.280
 into the brain as a fuel source.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.460
 It actually has to be carried

22:43.460 --> 22:46.660
 across the so-called blood brain barrier, the BBB.

22:46.660 --> 22:50.060
 And the actual metabolism of glucose

22:50.060 --> 22:52.380
 and the delivery of the glucose to the neurons

22:52.380 --> 22:54.340
 is carried out by a different cell type.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.100
 And it's a cell type that you should all know about

22:56.100 --> 22:59.340
 because it's the most abundant cell type in your brain

22:59.340 --> 23:01.140
 and maybe even in your entire nervous system.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.180
 And that's the so-called astrocyte.

23:03.180 --> 23:06.360
 Astrocytes are one of several types of glia.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.080
 The word glia means glue,

23:08.080 --> 23:11.020
 but many people have taken that name glia,

23:11.020 --> 23:12.700
 glue, to think that, oh,

23:12.700 --> 23:14.020
 the only thing that the astrocytes are doing

23:14.020 --> 23:15.460
 is just kind of holding things together.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.100
 Actually, the astrocytes are involved

23:17.100 --> 23:19.660
 in delivering glucose to the neurons.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.040
 They are critically involved

23:21.040 --> 23:23.960
 in shaping your neuronal function and brain plasticity,

23:23.960 --> 23:26.140
 the brain's ability to change in response to experience.

23:26.140 --> 23:28.060
 So these astrocytes are like the little waiters

23:28.060 --> 23:30.940
 and waitresses bringing glucose to the neurons

23:30.940 --> 23:32.540
 and the neurons are going to do the heavy lifting

23:32.540 --> 23:35.420
 that's involved in perception and behavior and action.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.580
 So if prior to this episode,

23:37.580 --> 23:39.820
 you didn't already realize that glucose,

23:39.820 --> 23:43.500
 blood sugar, is vital to the function of your brain

23:43.500 --> 23:46.900
 and other neurons of your nervous system, now you know.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.620
 And for those of you that have experienced

23:49.620 --> 23:52.140
 the increase in mental clarity

23:52.140 --> 23:55.980
 that comes after a properly timed,

23:55.980 --> 23:57.300
 properly composed,

23:57.300 --> 23:58.820
 meaning it has the right macronutrients

23:58.820 --> 24:01.700
 and the right ratios and the properly sized meal,

24:01.700 --> 24:03.520
 well, then now you have justification

24:03.520 --> 24:05.740
 for eating something as a way

24:05.740 --> 24:07.220
 to improve the way that your brain works.

24:07.220 --> 24:09.020
 It turns out that your brain is going to work best

24:09.020 --> 24:10.820
 when it's got glucose available.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.300
 Whether you like to fast or not,

24:12.300 --> 24:13.820
 that's just the reality of things.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.360
 The same thing is also true for the neurons in your body.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.720
 The way that you are able to move the limbs of your body,

24:19.720 --> 24:22.620
 the way that you are able to perform exercise

24:22.620 --> 24:24.760
 or movement of any kind for that matter,

24:24.760 --> 24:27.380
 is because neurons called motor neurons

24:27.380 --> 24:30.180
 send electrical potentials to the muscle fibers.

24:30.180 --> 24:32.540
 They release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,

24:32.540 --> 24:34.460
 which causes contraction of the muscle fibers

24:34.460 --> 24:36.700
 and allows you to move your limbs.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.540
 Those neurons are also very metabolically demanding,

24:39.540 --> 24:41.140
 especially when you're doing

24:41.140 --> 24:42.820
 demanding types of physical work.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.540
 And that could be cycling or running or weightlifting

24:44.540 --> 24:46.900
 or yoga or whatever it may be.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.400
 Those neurons require a ton of glucose.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.680
 If you've ever had the experience

24:51.680 --> 24:53.620
 of having to think very hard

24:53.620 --> 24:55.340
 about how you're generating a movement

24:55.340 --> 24:59.420
 or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise,

24:59.420 --> 25:01.900
 you might've thought, oh, you know, I'm running out of fuel.

25:01.900 --> 25:02.980
 That's why I'm getting tired.

25:02.980 --> 25:04.280
 It's hard to do.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.400
 That's actually the case sometimes,

25:06.400 --> 25:09.080
 but that's not always the case.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.280
 One of the reasons that it feels like work

25:11.280 --> 25:13.340
 is because your so-called upper motor neurons,

25:13.340 --> 25:15.060
 the one that control the lower motor neurons

25:15.060 --> 25:17.160
 in your spinal cord, which control your muscles,

25:17.160 --> 25:19.080
 they have to be very metabolically active.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.140
 It's one thing to engage in a reflexive movement

25:21.140 --> 25:22.180
 where you're just walking around

25:22.180 --> 25:23.780
 or if you're running continuously,

25:23.780 --> 25:25.960
 but when you suddenly have to focus on what you're doing

25:25.960 --> 25:27.780
 and you have to generate specific patterns

25:27.780 --> 25:31.160
 of motor movement, well, that feels demanding

25:31.160 --> 25:34.100
 because one, it increases the release of adrenaline

25:34.100 --> 25:34.940
 in your brain and body,

25:34.940 --> 25:37.140
 this makes you feel a little bit agitated and more alert,

25:37.140 --> 25:40.140
 but also deliberate thought,

25:40.140 --> 25:42.980
 deliberately controlling the way that your brain and body

25:42.980 --> 25:45.780
 is moving requires more glucose uptake,

25:45.780 --> 25:47.960
 more energy in those very neurons.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.660
 And this is also why after doing a long bout of exercise,

25:50.660 --> 25:51.500
 you might be tired,

25:51.500 --> 25:55.700
 but also if you do a bout of skill learning of any kind,

25:55.700 --> 25:57.260
 or if you've been reading and thinking

25:57.260 --> 25:58.580
 about what you're reading,

25:58.580 --> 26:01.420
 or if you had a intense conversation with somebody

26:01.420 --> 26:03.940
 where you're really forcing yourself to listen

26:03.940 --> 26:05.420
 and hopefully they're listening to you too

26:05.420 --> 26:07.060
 and you're really trying to parse what they're saying

26:07.060 --> 26:08.300
 and maybe you're doing that right now

26:08.300 --> 26:10.520
 and you're trying to really track something,

26:10.520 --> 26:13.100
 that's work and that work requires glucose uptake

26:13.100 --> 26:15.580
 by neurons both in the brain and in your body.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.060
 Now that we've established that glucose

26:17.060 --> 26:20.500
 is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system,

26:20.500 --> 26:22.980
 I'd like to concentrate on a few of the other types

26:22.980 --> 26:27.240
 of sugars that we ingest on a common basis

26:27.240 --> 26:30.880
 and the impact that those have on brain function

26:30.880 --> 26:32.000
 and body function.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.760
 I'd particularly like to focus on fructose.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.360
 Fructose of course is found in fruit.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.400
 It's also found in the infamous high fructose corn syrup,

26:40.400 --> 26:42.580
 which we will talk about today.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.360
 It's worth pointing out that the concentrations

26:44.360 --> 26:47.360
 of fructose in fruit is quite low compared

26:47.360 --> 26:50.320
 to the concentrations of fructose in high fructose corn syrup.

26:50.320 --> 26:55.080
 High fructose corn syrup is approximately 50% fructose,

26:55.080 --> 26:58.820
 which turns out to be an enormously high percentage

26:58.820 --> 27:03.040
 of anything really, especially when we contrast that

27:03.040 --> 27:05.560
 to the concentrations of fructose in fruit.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.060
 Fruits have other types of sugars in them as well.

27:09.360 --> 27:13.080
 The sucrose content of most fruit and fruit juices is low,

27:13.080 --> 27:15.920
 although there are some fruits like melons, peaches,

27:15.920 --> 27:19.560
 pineapples, and so forth that contain a little less

27:19.560 --> 27:22.040
 than 10% or so of sucrose.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.520
 Things like mangoes can have a lot of sucrose,

27:24.520 --> 27:26.360
 but typically the amount of fructose,

27:26.360 --> 27:29.000
 fructose I think is the proper pronunciation

27:29.000 --> 27:31.920
 that people are always correcting me, fructose,

27:31.920 --> 27:36.920
 is anywhere from 1% to about 10%, right?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.400
 It's really going to vary quite a bit.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.760
 And many of you have probably heard

27:41.760 --> 27:43.280
 of the so-called glycemic index,

27:43.280 --> 27:46.080
 which is basically a measure of how fast blood sugar rises

27:46.080 --> 27:48.400
 after eating particular foods, et cetera.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.560
 We're going to set aside the glycemic index for now.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.920
 We will come back to it.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.260
 It has some relationship to the concentrations

27:54.260 --> 27:55.800
 of fructose in fruit,

27:55.800 --> 27:58.020
 but the point that I'd like to make is that fructose

27:58.020 --> 28:01.100
 as a sugar is handled very differently in the body

28:01.100 --> 28:03.000
 than is glucose.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.560
 But I also want to emphasize that because the percentage

28:07.560 --> 28:09.960
 of fructose in fruit is rather low,

28:09.960 --> 28:13.200
 especially compared to high fructose corn syrup,

28:13.200 --> 28:16.040
 many people have demonized fructose saying

28:16.040 --> 28:20.720
 that fructose makes you fat or that fruit makes you fat.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.560
 If you look at the data, that's not really the case.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.300
 The fact of the matter is that the concentrations

28:25.300 --> 28:27.160
 of fructose and fruit are so low

28:27.160 --> 28:29.440
 that unless someone is consuming a lot of fruit

28:29.440 --> 28:31.280
 or they're consuming a lot of fruit

28:31.280 --> 28:34.920
 on the backdrop of a highly processed diet

28:34.920 --> 28:36.560
 or a diet that has a lot of other stuff

28:36.560 --> 28:38.220
 that they might not want to be ingesting,

28:38.220 --> 28:40.280
 you can't really say that fructose is fattening.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.340
 I don't really think that there's any basis

28:42.340 --> 28:44.360
 for saying that fructose itself is bad.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.460
 Now, high fructose corn syrup is a different issue

28:47.460 --> 28:50.820
 and too much consumption of anything but fructose included,

28:50.820 --> 28:52.560
 whether or not it comes from fruit or otherwise,

28:52.560 --> 28:55.360
 can be a problem for the ways that it impacts

28:55.360 --> 28:58.520
 the neural circuits that process sugar,

28:58.520 --> 29:00.280
 not just glucose, but fructose.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.320
 And so we'll illustrate those neural circuits in a bit

29:02.320 --> 29:04.760
 and it will become very clear to all of you,

29:04.760 --> 29:06.280
 regardless of whether or not you have a background

29:06.280 --> 29:09.280
 in biology or metabolism, nutrition or otherwise,

29:09.280 --> 29:12.320
 why ingesting very high concentrations of fructose

29:12.320 --> 29:13.880
 is not going to be a good thing

29:13.880 --> 29:15.760
 for the way that your brain functions.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.560
 One of the key distinctions between glucose and fructose

29:19.560 --> 29:23.360
 is that fructose most likely cannot directly access

29:23.360 --> 29:25.420
 the brain, it actually needs to be converted

29:25.420 --> 29:27.560
 into glucose in the liver.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.960
 And the way that conversion occurs,

29:29.960 --> 29:33.360
 feeds back to a set of hormones and neural pathways

29:33.360 --> 29:34.800
 that we talked about earlier,

29:34.800 --> 29:36.500
 which have a lot to do with appetite.

29:36.500 --> 29:40.640
 And to just summarize what is now a lot of very solid data,

29:41.920 --> 29:45.800
 fructose and specifically fructose has the ability

29:45.800 --> 29:49.640
 to reduce certain hormones and peptides in our body,

29:49.640 --> 29:52.880
 whose main job is to suppress ghrelin.

29:52.880 --> 29:56.200
 As you recall, ghrelin is a hormone that increases

29:56.200 --> 29:58.200
 the longer it's been since we've eaten

29:58.200 --> 29:59.760
 and ghrelin makes us hungry

29:59.760 --> 30:03.080
 by stimulating particular neurons in our hypothalamus.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.200
 It actually makes us really want to eat

30:05.200 --> 30:07.600
 and in particular really makes us want to eat

30:07.600 --> 30:09.560
 sugary and fatty foods.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.760
 Fructose reduces the activity of the hormones

30:12.760 --> 30:14.560
 that reduce ghrelin.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.300
 And so the net consequence of that

30:16.300 --> 30:19.700
 is that fructose increases ghrelin.

30:19.700 --> 30:24.280
 So although I, and I think pretty much everyone out there,

30:24.280 --> 30:26.240
 say for a few individuals,

30:26.240 --> 30:28.320
 agrees that calories in, calories out

30:28.320 --> 30:30.280
 is the fundamental principle of weight loss,

30:30.280 --> 30:32.120
 weight maintenance or weight gain,

30:32.120 --> 30:36.160
 ingesting fructose shifts our hormone system

30:36.160 --> 30:39.840
 and as a consequence, our neural pathways within our brain,

30:39.840 --> 30:43.120
 the hypothalamus, to be hungrier,

30:43.120 --> 30:47.500
 regardless of how many calories we've eaten, okay?

30:47.500 --> 30:50.200
 Now, I also want to be absolutely clear.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.200
 This does not mean that eating an apple

30:52.200 --> 30:54.960
 or eating a melon or eating a couple of apricots

30:54.960 --> 30:58.920
 or something is going to make you hyperphagic,

30:58.920 --> 31:00.400
 meaning it's going to make you just want to eat

31:00.400 --> 31:01.240
 and eat and eat.

31:01.240 --> 31:02.240
 That's simply not the case.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.840
 But if you compare fructose and you compare glucose,

31:05.840 --> 31:07.860
 not only are they metabolized differently

31:07.860 --> 31:09.360
 in the brain and body,

31:09.360 --> 31:10.880
 but in addition to that,

31:10.880 --> 31:14.600
 fructose has this impact of reducing the hormones

31:14.600 --> 31:17.960
 that reduce hunger hormones and neural circuits.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.720
 And so fructose does have this kind of twist

31:20.720 --> 31:23.560
 in its phenotype, right?

31:23.560 --> 31:27.000
 Or it's, I guess if fructose had a dating profile,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.240
 this would be a kind of a red flag in that profile.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.700
 Because fructose itself,

31:33.700 --> 31:38.040
 while it's actually a pretty good fuel source in many ways,

31:38.040 --> 31:40.160
 and it's often packaged in things like fruits,

31:40.160 --> 31:42.460
 which bring along fiber and vitamins and minerals

31:42.460 --> 31:45.000
 that I think for many of us are things

31:45.000 --> 31:47.280
 that we should be eating more of and ingesting more of,

31:47.280 --> 31:50.920
 it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.720
 And as a consequence, it can increase hunger.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.960
 So current recommendations for most people

31:56.960 --> 31:58.760
 are to eat more fruits and vegetables.

31:58.760 --> 32:02.200
 But for those of you that are trying to control your hunger,

32:02.200 --> 32:04.580
 ingesting a lot of fructose

32:04.580 --> 32:06.140
 is probably not going to be a good idea.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.800
 Certainly ingesting it from high fructose corn syrup

32:08.800 --> 32:09.760
 is not going to be a good idea

32:09.760 --> 32:12.580
 because of the enormous percentages of fructose

32:12.580 --> 32:15.700
 in high fructose corn syrup, 50% or sometimes even more.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.180
 But even from fruit,

32:17.180 --> 32:18.520
 some people will find that fruit

32:18.520 --> 32:19.860
 really quenches their appetite.

32:19.860 --> 32:22.760
 Other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.680
 And I suppose if you're trying to stimulate your appetite,

32:24.680 --> 32:25.800
 then ingesting more fruit

32:25.800 --> 32:28.440
 might actually be advantageous to you.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.340
 So fructose provides a bridge for us

32:31.340 --> 32:35.600
 between a particular kind of sugar, hormone function,

32:36.680 --> 32:39.560
 in this case, ghrelin and the hypothalamus,

32:39.560 --> 32:41.000
 which leads us to the next question,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.800
 which is what is it about sugar

32:43.800 --> 32:46.020
 that makes it such an attractive thing for us?

32:46.020 --> 32:47.800
 Why do we like it so much?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.960
 And the obvious answer that most people arrive at is,

32:50.960 --> 32:53.540
 well, it just tastes really, really good,

32:53.540 --> 32:56.800
 but that's actually not the way it works.

32:56.800 --> 33:00.680
 The rewarding properties, as we say, of sugar,

33:00.680 --> 33:03.840
 whether or not they come in the form of sucrose or fructose

33:03.840 --> 33:08.680
 or foods that increase glucose to a very high level,

33:08.680 --> 33:13.000
 actually is not just related to the taste of the foods

33:13.000 --> 33:16.080
 that produce that elevation in glucose, sucrose, or fructose.

33:16.080 --> 33:19.360
 It is in part, but that's only part of the story.

33:19.360 --> 33:22.340
 And the rest of the story, once you understand it,

33:22.340 --> 33:23.780
 can actually place you in a position

33:23.780 --> 33:28.380
 to much better control your sugar intake of all kinds,

33:28.380 --> 33:30.040
 but also your food intake in ways

33:30.040 --> 33:31.960
 that can allow you to make much better choices

33:31.960 --> 33:33.360
 about the foods you ingest.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.400
 And actually, at this point,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.720
 I should probably give a confession.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.800
 I've said today, and I'll say it again,

33:38.800 --> 33:40.240
 and I've said it on previous podcasts,

33:40.240 --> 33:42.800
 I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and indeed, that's true.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.400
 And I can kind of pass on chocolate or ice cream

33:45.400 --> 33:46.240
 or things like that.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.080
 It seems like with each successive year,

33:48.080 --> 33:50.800
 sweet things are less and less appealing to me.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.640
 Of course, savory foods,

33:52.640 --> 33:57.520
 anything that is really fatty, salty, savory,

33:57.520 --> 33:59.700
 those don't last long in my presence.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.720
 But I always say I don't really like sweet things so much,

34:02.720 --> 34:04.160
 and I like sweet people,

34:04.160 --> 34:06.340
 but I don't tend to like sweet foods,

34:06.340 --> 34:09.080
 which is true, but there's probably one exception,

34:09.080 --> 34:10.440
 and that's mangoes.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.640
 And it turns out that mangoes have the highest percentage

34:13.640 --> 34:16.440
 of sugar in them, in particular fructose,

34:16.440 --> 34:18.560
 as well as other forms of sugars.

34:18.560 --> 34:22.600
 So what I do, because I love mangoes so much,

34:22.600 --> 34:25.400
 is I will have mangoes probably twice a week,

34:25.400 --> 34:28.640
 but I'll have them after some sort of resistance training

34:28.640 --> 34:30.400
 or hard run or something like that,

34:30.400 --> 34:33.240
 because it is the case that after you exercise hard,

34:33.240 --> 34:36.980
 in particular exercise that is of the high intensity variety

34:36.980 --> 34:38.920
 that your body is more efficient

34:38.920 --> 34:41.740
 at using circulating blood sugar.

34:41.740 --> 34:44.840
 It's able to store that or use that for fuel.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.620
 And so what I'll typically do is just take the mango,

34:47.620 --> 34:48.960
 actually eat the peels too.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.460
 I know there are probably some people are going to cringe

34:50.460 --> 34:51.300
 when they hear that.

34:51.300 --> 34:52.120
 I find them delicious,

34:52.120 --> 34:53.520
 so I just bite into those things like apples.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.320
 I don't eat the pits, however.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.340
 So now I want to take us on a journey

34:57.340 --> 35:00.240
 into the nervous system to explain the pathways

35:00.240 --> 35:04.460
 in the brain and body that regulate our appetite for sugar.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.980
 Now, keep in mind what I already told you before,

35:06.980 --> 35:08.600
 which is that when we ingest foods,

35:08.600 --> 35:11.420
 they're broken down into various components

35:11.420 --> 35:14.020
 and glucose is going to be shuttled to the brain

35:14.020 --> 35:16.040
 and of course, to other neurons in our spinal cord

35:16.040 --> 35:18.720
 and elsewhere and to our muscles, et cetera,

35:18.720 --> 35:22.260
 in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues

35:22.260 --> 35:23.400
 to be able to function.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.980
 The fact that so many cells and organs and tissues

35:27.980 --> 35:30.420
 require glucose in order to function

35:30.420 --> 35:34.100
 has led to a situation where you have dedicated

35:34.100 --> 35:36.460
 neural machinery, pieces of your brain

35:36.460 --> 35:39.860
 that are almost entirely, if not entirely devoted

35:39.860 --> 35:44.700
 to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars

35:44.700 --> 35:48.300
 and to make sure that you not only seek those out,

35:48.300 --> 35:50.100
 but you know where those foods are

35:50.100 --> 35:53.500
 and that you ingest more and more and more of them.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.900
 And there are two main ways that these neural circuits work.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.940
 In fact, we can say that there are two neural circuits

35:57.940 --> 36:00.100
 entirely that work in parallel.

36:00.100 --> 36:03.340
 And this is a common theme throughout the nervous system

36:04.340 --> 36:06.100
 and that's parallel pathways.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.760
 Parallel pathways are the ways

36:07.760 --> 36:09.740
 that you can distinguish light from dark.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.820
 Parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish

36:11.820 --> 36:13.620
 high-pitched sounds from low-pitched sounds.

36:13.620 --> 36:16.520
 Parallel pathways are the ways that you can flex your muscles

36:16.520 --> 36:18.220
 versus extend your muscles.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.300
 For instance, if you move your wrist

36:19.300 --> 36:22.300
 closer to your shoulder, you're flexing your bicep

36:22.300 --> 36:23.620
 and you're actually inhibiting,

36:23.620 --> 36:25.340
 you're actually preventing the action of your tricep.

36:25.340 --> 36:28.540
 If you move your wrist away from your shoulder,

36:28.540 --> 36:31.500
 you are essentially using your extensor, your tricep,

36:31.500 --> 36:33.740
 and you're inhibiting the activity of your bicep.

36:33.740 --> 36:35.940
 So for every function in your body

36:35.940 --> 36:38.420
 that you might think is controlled by one brain area

36:38.420 --> 36:41.040
 or one neural circuit, almost always,

36:41.040 --> 36:43.620
 there are two or more so-called parallel pathways

36:43.620 --> 36:47.900
 that ensure that that particular behavior happens.

36:47.900 --> 36:51.020
 Now, in the case of sugar consumption,

36:51.020 --> 36:54.060
 the two parallel pathways involve one pathway

36:54.060 --> 36:57.420
 related to the actual taste and the perception

36:57.420 --> 37:01.280
 of sweet tastes that lead not just you,

37:01.280 --> 37:03.580
 but every animal that we're aware of

37:03.580 --> 37:07.160
 to seek more sweet-containing foods.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.660
 The other parallel pathway is related

37:10.660 --> 37:14.800
 to the nutritive component of sweet foods,

37:14.800 --> 37:17.620
 meaning the degree to which a given food

37:17.620 --> 37:19.540
 will raise blood glucose.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.700
 I want to repeat that.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.960
 One pathway in your brain and body

37:22.960 --> 37:26.500
 is devoted to getting you to seek out sweet-tasting things

37:26.500 --> 37:28.340
 that you perceive as sweet,

37:28.340 --> 37:31.660
 and another parallel pathway is devoted

37:31.660 --> 37:33.900
 to getting you to seek out foods

37:33.900 --> 37:37.200
 that lead to increases in blood glucose.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.980
 It just so happens that the foods

37:38.980 --> 37:41.700
 that lead to big increases in blood glucose

37:41.700 --> 37:44.880
 typically are associated with that sweet taste.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.620
 Now, this is distinctly different

37:46.620 --> 37:48.980
 than the neural pathways that control seeking

37:48.980 --> 37:53.220
 of savory foods or salty foods or spicy foods,

37:53.220 --> 37:55.180
 for that matter, or bitter foods.

37:55.180 --> 37:58.800
 The sweet pathway is what we would call hardwired.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.060
 It exists, as far as we know,

38:00.060 --> 38:02.460
 in every mammal that even exists in fruit flies,

38:02.460 --> 38:04.040
 hence fruit fly.

38:04.040 --> 38:07.220
 Basically, getting sweet stuff into the body

38:07.220 --> 38:09.380
 might seem like it has a lot to do with the taste,

38:09.380 --> 38:11.780
 but it has just as much to do

38:11.780 --> 38:15.940
 with the nutritive components that sweet-tasting foods carry

38:15.940 --> 38:17.840
 and the fact that your nervous system

38:17.840 --> 38:22.180
 and so many cells in your brain and body run on glucose.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.620
 If you recall earlier, I said,

38:23.620 --> 38:25.520
 even if you ingest fructose,

38:25.520 --> 38:28.840
 fructose can be converted into glucose in the liver.

38:29.780 --> 38:30.740
 And I mentioned, of course,

38:30.740 --> 38:32.700
 that fructose may actually work directly on the brain.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.460
 That's still unclear for humans.

38:34.460 --> 38:35.620
 The jury's still out on that.

38:35.620 --> 38:36.880
 We will see.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.900
 But the fundamental thing to understand here

38:39.900 --> 38:42.420
 is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate

38:42.420 --> 38:44.120
 or you think you want a piece of cake

38:44.120 --> 38:46.780
 or you're craving something sweet,

38:46.780 --> 38:48.620
 you are both craving the taste

38:48.620 --> 38:51.700
 and your neurons are literally craving

38:51.700 --> 38:55.420
 the nutritive components that arrive with that taste.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.900
 And simply by understanding that can allow you

38:57.900 --> 39:00.940
 to circumvent some of the sugar cravings

39:00.940 --> 39:05.500
 that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.560
 Also in this episode, I will talk about ways

39:07.560 --> 39:10.220
 that you can sort of undermine or short-circuit

39:10.220 --> 39:11.580
 these circuits, if you will,

39:11.580 --> 39:14.620
 in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis,

39:14.620 --> 39:16.340
 if that's your goal.

39:16.340 --> 39:18.040
 Two parallel pathways.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.620
 One of the parallel pathways has to do

39:19.620 --> 39:21.060
 with conscious perception.

39:21.060 --> 39:24.540
 So animals of all kinds, mice, rats, and humans

39:24.540 --> 39:28.700
 will prefer sugary taste to non-sugary taste.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.220
 When we eat something that tastes sweet,

39:33.220 --> 39:37.840
 we register that sweet taste by way of sweet receptors,

39:37.840 --> 39:41.860
 literally little ports or portals of neurons

39:41.860 --> 39:44.140
 on our tongue and on our palate.

39:44.140 --> 39:45.140
 A lot of people don't realize this,

39:45.140 --> 39:48.260
 but there are a lot of taste receptors on the soft palate

39:48.260 --> 39:50.660
 and around the mouth, so on the sides of the mouth.

39:50.660 --> 39:51.920
 So you're actually tasting things,

39:51.920 --> 39:52.760
 not just with your tongue,

39:52.760 --> 39:54.820
 but with your entire mouth and your palate.

39:54.820 --> 39:57.340
 So when you ingest something sweet,

39:57.340 --> 39:58.980
 very quickly there are signals sent

39:58.980 --> 40:00.860
 from those neurons in your mouth

40:00.860 --> 40:04.260
 to brain areas that cause you to seek out

40:04.260 --> 40:07.180
 or at least pay attention to the source

40:07.180 --> 40:08.780
 and the abundance of those sweet things.

40:08.780 --> 40:11.400
 They literally change your perception.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.940
 In fact, there are beautiful neuroimaging studies

40:13.940 --> 40:17.960
 that show that when people ingest a sugary drink,

40:17.960 --> 40:22.220
 their perception of images of foods change very much

40:22.220 --> 40:24.780
 to make those foods appear more appetizing

40:24.780 --> 40:28.300
 and not just foods that contain sugar.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.900
 Results of those studies do show that there's an increase,

40:30.900 --> 40:34.300
 for instance, in the perception of detail

40:34.300 --> 40:36.940
 and images of ice cream after you ingest a sweet drink

40:36.940 --> 40:40.180
 or even put like a hard candy into your mouth,

40:40.180 --> 40:42.220
 it will make you seek out sugary things more,

40:42.220 --> 40:44.160
 it will make sugary things look more appetizing,

40:44.160 --> 40:46.900
 but also other foods more appetizing.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.020
 So I think it's important that people recognize that fact

40:49.020 --> 40:51.700
 that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth

40:51.700 --> 40:54.860
 or when you've tasted something sweet within your mouth,

40:54.860 --> 40:57.800
 I should say, your perception of food

40:57.800 --> 40:59.700
 has immediately shifted.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.540
 These are fast neural pathways,

41:01.540 --> 41:03.000
 then we'll get into some of the brain structures

41:03.000 --> 41:05.460
 in a moment, but these are fast neural pathways

41:05.460 --> 41:08.100
 that shift your entire self

41:08.100 --> 41:12.720
 toward seeking more sugary stuff and more food generally.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.180
 Now, does that mean that you should

41:14.180 --> 41:15.860
 never ingest anything sweet?

41:15.860 --> 41:18.660
 No, certainly I'm not saying that.

41:18.660 --> 41:20.040
 Everyone has to decide for themselves

41:20.040 --> 41:22.100
 what the appropriate amount of sugar intake is,

41:22.100 --> 41:24.900
 but I find it remarkable when people say,

41:24.900 --> 41:26.900
 oh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix

41:26.900 --> 41:28.660
 or I need to have my chocolate

41:28.660 --> 41:29.940
 or I need to have a little bit of something

41:29.940 --> 41:32.620
 to just kind of take care of that sugar appetite

41:32.620 --> 41:35.240
 because in taking care of that sugar appetite,

41:35.240 --> 41:36.700
 maybe for the very disciplined of you,

41:36.700 --> 41:38.340
 you can just have that one piece of chocolate

41:38.340 --> 41:40.120
 and it's great and you can relish in it,

41:40.120 --> 41:42.500
 but it does shift the way

41:42.500 --> 41:44.500
 that you perceive other foods as well.

41:44.500 --> 41:47.420
 And the way it does that is through our,

41:47.420 --> 41:49.380
 probably if you're a listener to this podcast now,

41:49.380 --> 41:53.860
 old friend, but incredible neuromodulator dopamine.

41:53.860 --> 41:55.700
 Dopamine is a molecule that is released

41:55.700 --> 41:57.740
 from several places in the brain.

41:57.740 --> 42:00.000
 There's a so-called mesolimbic reward pathway,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.500
 which is a whole set of places in the brain or circuits

42:02.500 --> 42:04.500
 designed to get us motivated

42:04.500 --> 42:06.780
 and craving and in pursuit of things.

42:06.780 --> 42:07.700
 And then of course,

42:07.700 --> 42:09.700
 there are areas of the brain that are involved in movement

42:09.700 --> 42:13.620
 that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation.

42:13.620 --> 42:14.440
 That makes perfect sense.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.220
 Why would you have a brain area involved in motivation

42:17.220 --> 42:19.060
 if you couldn't actually do something with that motivation?

42:19.060 --> 42:20.960
 So the way that your brain is designed

42:20.960 --> 42:22.920
 is when there's an increase in dopamine

42:22.920 --> 42:24.380
 in the mesolimbic reward pathway,

42:24.380 --> 42:26.300
 there are signals sent to an area of the brain

42:26.300 --> 42:27.140
 called the striatum.

42:27.140 --> 42:28.540
 We're going to spend a little bit of time today

42:28.540 --> 42:29.420
 in the striatum.

42:29.420 --> 42:31.580
 It's got a dorsal part, meaning an upper part,

42:31.580 --> 42:33.820
 and a ventral part, which means a lower part.

42:33.820 --> 42:38.260
 And the dopamine sent to those areas places us, excuse me,

42:38.260 --> 42:41.920
 into modes of action to pursue particular things.

42:43.340 --> 42:46.980
 Sugar or sweet tastes, I should say to be more specific,

42:46.980 --> 42:49.580
 have an incredibly potent ability

42:49.580 --> 42:51.420
 to activate dopamine release

42:51.420 --> 42:53.580
 within the mesolimbic reward pathway.

42:53.580 --> 42:56.140
 This has been shown over and over and over again

42:57.280 --> 43:00.180
 in animal models and in humans.

43:00.180 --> 43:03.460
 This is especially true, I should mention,

43:03.460 --> 43:06.700
 through the ingestion of sweet liquids.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.940
 Now, this becomes a very important point to us

43:08.940 --> 43:12.740
 a little later on when we talk about the proliferation

43:12.740 --> 43:15.300
 of sodas and sweet drinks,

43:15.300 --> 43:19.460
 and dare I even say non-sugar or diet sodas.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.340
 We're going to get into that a little bit later,

43:21.340 --> 43:25.060
 perhaps one of the most third rail topics in nutrition.

43:25.060 --> 43:28.500
 But when we ingest something sweet,

43:28.500 --> 43:31.340
 the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine

43:31.340 --> 43:33.220
 in the mesolimbic reward pathways,

43:33.220 --> 43:36.600
 which then are conveyed to pathways for motor behavior,

43:36.600 --> 43:39.660
 and in general, place us into modes of focused action

43:39.660 --> 43:42.860
 toward getting more of whatever was sweet.

43:42.860 --> 43:45.020
 Again, for those of you that are very disciplined,

43:45.020 --> 43:47.740
 you can probably eat that one piece of chocolate

43:47.740 --> 43:49.420
 and be just fine.

43:49.420 --> 43:52.720
 But if you understand the way that dopamine works,

43:52.720 --> 43:54.900
 what you'll realize is that when this dopamine pathway

43:54.900 --> 43:59.320
 is triggered, it tends to create not the sensation

43:59.320 --> 44:01.300
 or the perception of satiety,

44:01.300 --> 44:03.140
 of feeling like something is enough,

44:03.140 --> 44:07.340
 but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.340
 As described in the episode that I hosted

44:09.340 --> 44:11.420
 with my phenomenal colleague

44:11.420 --> 44:14.060
 from Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lemke,

44:14.060 --> 44:16.620
 she's an expert on addiction and dopamine pathways.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.220
 The dopamine circuits of the brain

44:20.220 --> 44:23.460
 have what we call a pleasure pain balance.

44:23.460 --> 44:27.640
 And there I'm paraphrasing what Dr. Anna Lemke has said

44:27.640 --> 44:29.420
 and has written about in her beautiful book,

44:29.420 --> 44:30.260
 ''Dopamine Nation.''

44:30.260 --> 44:32.360
 If you haven't read that book, I highly recommend it.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.700
 Whether or not you have issues with addiction

44:34.700 --> 44:37.140
 or you know people that do, or you don't,

44:37.140 --> 44:39.120
 it's an incredibly important read,

44:39.120 --> 44:40.060
 especially if you're interested

44:40.060 --> 44:41.960
 in understanding motivated behaviors

44:41.960 --> 44:44.960
 and ways to channel your behaviors in life

44:44.960 --> 44:46.880
 toward healthy motivated behaviors

44:46.880 --> 44:49.740
 and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls

44:49.740 --> 44:51.900
 that people fall into, not just addiction,

44:51.900 --> 44:55.220
 but things like overuse of social media

44:55.220 --> 45:00.100
 or wasting time in general, it's a phenomenal book.

45:00.100 --> 45:03.280
 In that book and of course, within research articles,

45:04.180 --> 45:06.660
 you will find evidence of this so-called

45:06.660 --> 45:10.180
 pleasure pain balance that exists

45:10.180 --> 45:11.400
 within our dopamine circuits.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.820
 Nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them

45:13.820 --> 45:15.560
 to escape this pleasure pain balance.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.380
 And the way this works is that any time

45:17.380 --> 45:21.020
 that we engage in a behavior or we ingest something

45:21.020 --> 45:23.220
 that increases our levels of dopamine,

45:24.360 --> 45:27.780
 there is a subsequent increase in the neural circuits

45:27.780 --> 45:32.740
 that control our sense of frustration, pain, and lack.

45:32.740 --> 45:35.780
 And you can actually notice this phenomenon.

45:35.780 --> 45:39.460
 If for instance, you're somebody who really likes chocolate

45:39.460 --> 45:41.460
 or you really like something else,

45:41.460 --> 45:44.500
 pay attention to the way that you experience

45:44.500 --> 45:45.960
 indulging in that thing.

45:47.180 --> 45:49.260
 If you eat that piece of chocolate

45:49.260 --> 45:52.400
 and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste,

45:52.400 --> 45:56.380
 you'll notice that it provides some quenching

45:56.380 --> 45:59.500
 of your desire for let's say sweet stuff

45:59.500 --> 46:01.540
 or chocolate or both.

46:01.540 --> 46:05.200
 But right as you stop experiencing that,

46:05.200 --> 46:08.420
 right as that chocolate intake tapers off,

46:08.420 --> 46:09.900
 as you swallow it down your throat

46:09.900 --> 46:12.700
 or you just pause for a second afterwards,

46:12.700 --> 46:15.540
 what you'll notice is that your brain and body

46:15.540 --> 46:18.980
 actually orient toward wanting more.

46:18.980 --> 46:22.300
 And that wanting of more is really the action

46:22.300 --> 46:24.340
 of the neural circuits that underlie pain

46:24.340 --> 46:27.860
 and are pushing your dopamine levels back down.

46:27.860 --> 46:30.020
 And when these circuits go awry,

46:30.020 --> 46:34.940
 or I should say when people fail to control themselves

46:34.940 --> 46:37.460
 within the context of that pleasure pain balance,

46:37.460 --> 46:40.340
 the typical behavior is to reach for yet another chocolate

46:40.340 --> 46:44.660
 or to then look for something that will quench that desire

46:44.660 --> 46:46.400
 and get dopamine levels back up.

46:46.400 --> 46:49.140
 Now, the way these pleasure pain circuits work

46:49.140 --> 46:51.080
 is very diabolical because it turns out

46:51.080 --> 46:52.740
 that were you to take another piece of chocolate,

46:52.740 --> 46:54.740
 yes, your dopamine levels would go back up,

46:54.740 --> 46:57.820
 but not to the same extent that they did

46:57.820 --> 47:00.660
 the first bite of chocolate that you had.

47:00.660 --> 47:02.800
 In fact, we can say that the longer it's been

47:02.800 --> 47:06.140
 since you've indulged in something that you really enjoy

47:06.140 --> 47:10.860
 or would like, the greater the dopamine you will experience

47:10.860 --> 47:13.460
 when you finally engage in that behavior

47:13.460 --> 47:16.180
 or indulge that thing, ingest that thing,

47:16.180 --> 47:18.980
 and the greater the dopamine increase,

47:18.980 --> 47:22.420
 the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits.

47:22.420 --> 47:25.520
 So this puts you on a very complicated seesaw.

47:25.520 --> 47:28.540
 It's a very wobbly precarious state to be in,

47:28.540 --> 47:30.380
 which is not to say you shouldn't have a piece of chocolate.

47:30.380 --> 47:35.220
 It's just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things,

47:35.220 --> 47:37.240
 in particular things that we crave very much

47:37.240 --> 47:38.260
 and we wait and wait and wait,

47:38.260 --> 47:40.260
 and then we allow ourselves to indulge,

47:41.340 --> 47:43.540
 those trigger changes in our neurochemistry

47:43.540 --> 47:45.260
 and our neural circuits that place us

47:45.260 --> 47:47.660
 in a very vulnerable place

47:47.660 --> 47:50.180
 to either want more and more of that thing

47:50.180 --> 47:55.180
 or to seek out other ways to fill that kind of emptiness

47:55.300 --> 47:57.820
 that we feel or that gap like, oh, I would love more,

47:57.820 --> 47:59.580
 but I'm not going to allow myself more.

47:59.580 --> 48:01.100
 Now, again, I'm not saying

48:01.100 --> 48:03.000
 that you shouldn't pursue pleasurable things.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.500
 I mean, this molecule dopamine exists for a reason.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.660
 It's the, frankly,

48:06.660 --> 48:09.260
 because of its involvement in sex and reproduction,

48:09.260 --> 48:11.000
 it's the reason we're all here in the first place,

48:11.000 --> 48:12.100
 because last time I checked,

48:12.100 --> 48:15.640
 the only way any of us got here was one way or another,

48:15.640 --> 48:18.100
 sperm met egg and there was conception.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.840
 I still believe there are no exceptions to that

48:20.840 --> 48:22.140
 that I'm aware of anyways.

48:23.240 --> 48:24.980
 That is a process where I should say

48:24.980 --> 48:26.540
 the events leading up to that process

48:26.540 --> 48:28.540
 typically involve dopamine in one way or another.

48:28.540 --> 48:31.140
 There are exceptions to that too, but you get the idea.

48:31.140 --> 48:33.820
 These dopamine pathways are not evil, they're not bad,

48:33.820 --> 48:36.420
 but once you understand the way they work,

48:36.420 --> 48:39.180
 you can leverage them to your advantage

48:39.180 --> 48:42.580
 as opposed to them leveraging you to their advantage.

48:42.580 --> 48:44.980
 Okay, so when you ingest something sweet,

48:44.980 --> 48:48.340
 you perceive that sweet taste and a cascade ensues

48:48.340 --> 48:50.460
 within your brain that makes you want more

48:50.460 --> 48:51.800
 of the sweet thing.

48:51.800 --> 48:56.800
 That's the conscious pathway for sugar perception,

48:57.260 --> 48:59.540
 for sweet perception.

48:59.540 --> 49:01.140
 Now there's the second pathway.

49:01.140 --> 49:02.640
 The second pathway is what's called

49:02.640 --> 49:06.260
 the post-ingestive reinforcing properties of sugar,

49:06.260 --> 49:09.340
 which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying,

49:09.340 --> 49:12.060
 there are events that happen within your stomach

49:12.060 --> 49:14.120
 and below your conscious detection

49:14.120 --> 49:17.980
 that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things

49:17.980 --> 49:20.100
 independent of their taste

49:20.100 --> 49:23.220
 and foods that increase blood glucose

49:23.220 --> 49:24.900
 independent of their taste.

49:24.900 --> 49:26.580
 In order to illustrate the immense power

49:26.580 --> 49:29.540
 of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking,

49:29.540 --> 49:31.120
 I'd like to describe an experiment.

49:31.120 --> 49:33.420
 And this is just one experiment of many,

49:33.420 --> 49:36.060
 of dozens or more experiments done in animal models

49:36.060 --> 49:38.140
 and humans, which essentially illustrate the same thing.

49:38.140 --> 49:39.780
 And as I described this experiment,

49:39.780 --> 49:41.980
 I think you will come to understand

49:41.980 --> 49:43.620
 the power of these circuits.

49:43.620 --> 49:47.980
 I'll provide a link to this study in the caption.

49:47.980 --> 49:49.840
 The first author is Freeman.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.820
 The paper was published in Frontiers in Bioscience,

49:51.820 --> 49:55.300
 but there have been others, papers in Nature Neuroscience,

49:55.300 --> 49:57.280
 papers in Neuron, Cell Press Journals, et cetera,

49:57.280 --> 49:59.220
 many, many journals, many, many papers.

50:00.680 --> 50:04.440
 If subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water

50:04.440 --> 50:06.900
 or a sweet tasting fluid,

50:06.900 --> 50:08.980
 their preference for the sweet tasting fluid

50:08.980 --> 50:11.540
 is much, much higher, right?

50:11.540 --> 50:14.040
 Sweet things taste better than plain water,

50:14.040 --> 50:18.540
 at least for most people and certainly for animals.

50:18.540 --> 50:22.460
 Now, if for instance, you take an animal

50:22.460 --> 50:25.340
 which completely lacks sweet receptors,

50:25.340 --> 50:28.720
 and you can do this through some molecular genetic tools

50:28.720 --> 50:30.900
 and gymnastics in the laboratory,

50:30.900 --> 50:32.080
 we call these knockout mice

50:32.080 --> 50:33.660
 where you can knock out a particular receptor

50:33.660 --> 50:34.480
 for sweet taste.

50:34.480 --> 50:37.340
 You can confirm that there's no perception of sweet things

50:37.340 --> 50:39.740
 or at least no preference for sweet things

50:39.740 --> 50:40.580
 in those animals.

50:40.580 --> 50:41.800
 In humans, you can numb the mouth.

50:41.800 --> 50:44.100
 There are other pharmacologic ways

50:44.100 --> 50:46.660
 that you can eliminate sweet receptors in the mouth.

50:47.540 --> 50:49.980
 And by doing that, people will tell you,

50:49.980 --> 50:51.500
 no, I can't taste anything sweet.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.000
 It's just, you could give them an ice cream,

50:54.000 --> 50:55.340
 you could give them pure sucrose,

50:55.340 --> 50:56.600
 you give them table sugar,

50:56.600 --> 50:58.980
 and they wouldn't be able to perceive it as sweet.

50:58.980 --> 51:01.460
 If you eliminate the perception of sweet taste in the mouth

51:01.460 --> 51:05.740
 and you offer people or laboratory animals water

51:05.740 --> 51:08.460
 versus some sugar containing solution,

51:08.460 --> 51:12.420
 you eliminate the preference for the sugary solution,

51:12.420 --> 51:14.480
 which tells us that the perception of sweet

51:14.480 --> 51:19.380
 is important for the preference for sweet tasting drink.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.620
 This is also true for sweet tasting foods,

51:21.620 --> 51:23.140
 I should mention.

51:23.140 --> 51:27.020
 However, in both animal models and in humans,

51:27.020 --> 51:28.880
 after about 15 minutes,

51:30.660 --> 51:34.140
 subjects start preferring the sugary water,

51:34.140 --> 51:37.620
 even though they can't taste that it is sweeter.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.100
 So to repeat that,

51:39.100 --> 51:41.700
 if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet,

51:41.700 --> 51:44.360
 to perceive sweetness in foods,

51:44.360 --> 51:47.180
 then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages

51:47.180 --> 51:48.500
 or sweet foods.

51:48.500 --> 51:49.480
 So that's not surprising.

51:49.480 --> 51:51.460
 But if you wait about 15 minutes,

51:51.460 --> 51:54.640
 the preference for the sweet beverage

51:54.640 --> 51:56.260
 or the sweet food comes back.

51:56.260 --> 51:59.120
 Now that doesn't mean that they can perceive the sweetness.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.920
 In fact, the way these experiments are done is very clever.

52:01.920 --> 52:04.940
 You offer people various cups of different things

52:04.940 --> 52:06.020
 or different food items,

52:06.020 --> 52:07.640
 and then you just look at what they eat more of

52:07.640 --> 52:09.100
 or what they prefer to eat more of.

52:09.100 --> 52:13.060
 So this experiment is so crucial because what it says

52:13.060 --> 52:16.960
 is that the preference for sugar containing foods

52:16.960 --> 52:19.980
 is in part due to the sweetness of those foods,

52:19.980 --> 52:22.420
 but in part due to something else.

52:22.420 --> 52:24.000
 And this something else is what we call

52:24.000 --> 52:26.100
 the post-ingestive effect.

52:26.100 --> 52:28.140
 And as I mentioned before, it took about 15 minutes.

52:28.140 --> 52:30.800
 And you've actually experienced this,

52:30.800 --> 52:32.220
 whether you realize it or not,

52:32.220 --> 52:35.420
 this phenomenon of post-ingestive rewarding properties

52:35.420 --> 52:36.980
 of sweet foods,

52:36.980 --> 52:40.080
 meaning what happens in your body when you ingest something

52:40.080 --> 52:42.420
 that increases your blood glucose very much

52:42.420 --> 52:46.580
 has no doubt controlled you from the inside

52:46.580 --> 52:48.220
 below your awareness.

52:48.220 --> 52:51.240
 This was happening to you and you didn't realize it.

52:52.180 --> 52:53.300
 And here's how it works.

52:53.300 --> 52:55.860
 We all have neurons within our gut.

52:55.860 --> 52:56.860
 These neurons have a name.

52:56.860 --> 52:58.900
 They are called neuropod cells.

52:58.900 --> 53:01.180
 Neuropod cells were famously discovered

53:01.180 --> 53:05.940
 by professor Dr. Diego Bajorquez at Duke University.

53:05.940 --> 53:09.860
 And these cells respond to, among other things,

53:09.860 --> 53:12.760
 to the presence of sugar within the gut.

53:12.760 --> 53:16.120
 So when we ingest a sugary food or drink,

53:16.120 --> 53:19.540
 or we ingest a food or drink that simply contains

53:19.540 --> 53:23.300
 fructose, sucrose, glucose, or some other form of sugar

53:23.300 --> 53:26.380
 that later through metabolism

53:26.380 --> 53:28.160
 will be converted into glucose,

53:28.160 --> 53:32.680
 the neuropod cells are able to register the presence

53:32.680 --> 53:37.200
 of those sweet or glucose stimulating foods.

53:37.200 --> 53:41.200
 And in response to that, send electrical signals,

53:41.200 --> 53:43.520
 because electrical signals are the way neurons communicate,

53:43.520 --> 53:46.520
 up to the brain via the so-called vagus nerve.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.680
 The vagus nerve, of course, being a nerve pathway,

53:48.680 --> 53:50.620
 famous for its role in relaxation.

53:50.620 --> 53:53.040
 That's kind of the assumption out there

53:53.040 --> 53:54.400
 that it's always involved in relaxation.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.320
 That's not the case.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.800
 It's involved in a lot of things besides relaxation,

53:57.800 --> 54:00.600
 but nonetheless, these neuropod cells send

54:00.600 --> 54:03.680
 electrical signals through a particular highway

54:03.680 --> 54:06.720
 within the vagus to the so-called nodose ganglion.

54:06.720 --> 54:07.760
 This is a cluster.

54:07.760 --> 54:09.880
 A ganglion is just a cluster of neurons.

54:09.880 --> 54:12.860
 And then the nodose ganglion sends on information

54:12.860 --> 54:16.060
 to the nucleus of the solitary tract.

54:16.060 --> 54:18.420
 The nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain

54:18.420 --> 54:20.620
 that we're going to talk about extensively today.

54:20.620 --> 54:23.920
 It's very important for understanding sugar preference.

54:23.920 --> 54:28.840
 These neuropod cells also trigger activation

54:28.840 --> 54:33.280
 of dopamine pathways within the mesolimbic reward pathway.

54:33.280 --> 54:36.880
 In other words, there are signals conveyed from the gut,

54:36.880 --> 54:39.760
 meaning stomach and intestines, to the brain

54:39.760 --> 54:42.680
 anytime we ingest sweet foods,

54:42.680 --> 54:45.200
 but it has nothing to do with our perception

54:45.200 --> 54:46.020
 of them being sweet.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.640
 It has everything to do with the fact

54:47.640 --> 54:50.680
 that sweetness of food is almost always correlated

54:50.680 --> 54:54.200
 with an ability to increase blood glucose.

54:54.200 --> 54:58.120
 And the net effect of this is a parallel pathway

54:58.120 --> 55:01.200
 by which dopamine is increased further.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.300
 Now, the experiment that I described before

55:04.300 --> 55:07.500
 of animals or humans ingesting something

55:07.500 --> 55:08.680
 that contains sugar,

55:08.680 --> 55:10.900
 but not being able to perceive its sweetness,

55:10.900 --> 55:14.060
 and yet after a period of time,

55:14.060 --> 55:16.560
 still preferring that food or drink

55:16.560 --> 55:19.280
 to non-sugar containing food or drinks,

55:19.280 --> 55:21.720
 even though they can't distinguish their tastes,

55:21.720 --> 55:26.560
 is dependent on these neuropod cells and related pathways.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.140
 What this means for you

55:28.140 --> 55:30.560
 is that anytime you eat something sweet,

55:31.680 --> 55:35.040
 that substance is actually causing your gut,

55:35.040 --> 55:36.880
 your stomach and your intestine,

55:36.880 --> 55:39.160
 or to be more precise, I should say,

55:39.160 --> 55:43.340
 that food substance is causing the neuropod cells

55:43.340 --> 55:45.200
 in your stomach and intestines

55:45.200 --> 55:48.760
 to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain saying,

55:48.760 --> 55:51.400
 eat more of that, or simply eat more,

55:51.400 --> 55:54.540
 eat more, eat more, and preferably eat more sweet foods.

55:54.540 --> 55:56.800
 So we've all heard of hidden sugars,

55:56.800 --> 55:59.660
 meaning the sugars that manufacturers have put into foods

55:59.660 --> 56:01.600
 and disguise them with other flavors.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.660
 I talked about this in the episode on salt,

56:03.660 --> 56:06.020
 using salt to mask the taste of sweetness

56:06.020 --> 56:08.240
 so that people ingest more sugar.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.680
 That is not an accident that hidden sugars

56:10.680 --> 56:14.520
 are often hidden with salt or with other flavors.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.940
 It's done so that people will, meaning you or me,

56:17.940 --> 56:21.880
 will want to ingest more of a particular food

56:21.880 --> 56:24.600
 independent of how sweet that food tastes.

56:24.600 --> 56:27.040
 And in fact, some crackers, for instance,

56:27.040 --> 56:28.520
 chips, for instance, you might think,

56:28.520 --> 56:30.880
 oh, well, you know, chips, they're not sweet,

56:30.880 --> 56:33.040
 they're salty and savory.

56:33.040 --> 56:36.080
 Again, I'll mention I love salty savory foods,

56:36.080 --> 56:37.160
 including certain foods.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.440
 I love kettle chips, for instance,

56:38.440 --> 56:41.280
 that I try not to walk by them in the grocery store.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.200
 I usually have to eat one bag while I'm in the store

56:43.200 --> 56:44.540
 and then another later.

56:44.540 --> 56:49.540
 The savory foods are often laden with these hidden sugars

56:49.980 --> 56:51.920
 that we can't register as sweetness,

56:51.920 --> 56:53.360
 but trigger the neuropod cells,

56:53.360 --> 56:54.800
 which then further trigger dopamine,

56:54.800 --> 56:56.640
 which make us want more of them.

56:56.640 --> 56:59.320
 Now, we may be able to resist eating more of them,

56:59.320 --> 57:03.560
 but it makes us crave more food in general.

57:03.560 --> 57:07.340
 Now, we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway,

57:07.340 --> 57:10.720
 to sort of intervene in this subconscious pathway.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.480
 But for now, I'm hoping that just the understanding

57:14.480 --> 57:15.800
 that we all have this pathway,

57:15.800 --> 57:17.960
 this is hardwired into our body,

57:19.600 --> 57:21.840
 could potentially allow people to better understand

57:21.840 --> 57:25.440
 why is it that their cravings are so intense,

57:25.440 --> 57:28.440
 that it's not necessarily just about the taste of that food.

57:28.440 --> 57:33.040
 And when you consider this in concert with the fact

57:33.040 --> 57:36.040
 that we have this dopamine pain pleasure balance,

57:36.040 --> 57:38.200
 excuse me, that I referred to earlier,

57:38.200 --> 57:40.400
 you start to realize that there are multiple mechanisms

57:40.400 --> 57:43.240
 hardwired into us that make it especially hard

57:43.240 --> 57:45.320
 to not eat the sweet thing

57:45.320 --> 57:47.480
 or to not eat the food that we're craving.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.800
 And indeed, that's the case.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.720
 We have two major accelerators.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.980
 It's like a car with two accelerators,

57:52.980 --> 57:54.820
 and we will talk about the brakes,

57:54.820 --> 57:58.040
 but two ways that really get us into forward motion

57:58.040 --> 58:01.120
 toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods.

58:01.120 --> 58:03.320
 Now, if it doesn't already seem diabolical enough

58:03.320 --> 58:05.920
 that sweet things that we perceive as sweet

58:05.920 --> 58:08.000
 make us want to eat more of those because of dopamine

58:08.000 --> 58:11.780
 and then send us down this pain pleasure pathway

58:11.780 --> 58:13.020
 that I mentioned earlier,

58:13.020 --> 58:15.960
 and the fact that we have this subconscious circuit

58:15.960 --> 58:18.100
 coming from the neuropod cells in our gut

58:18.100 --> 58:20.680
 that are registering the presence of sugar

58:20.680 --> 58:22.640
 or glucose increasing foods in our gut

58:22.640 --> 58:23.800
 and sending those signals to the brain

58:23.800 --> 58:27.640
 for yet more dopamine pain pleasure challenges,

58:27.640 --> 58:30.000
 there's a third layer to this whole thing.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.280
 And that has to do with how sugar is metabolized

58:33.280 --> 58:35.800
 in the brain, or I should say how glucose is used.

58:35.800 --> 58:38.260
 Without getting into too much detail,

58:38.260 --> 58:41.640
 some of the more beautiful studies of neuroimaging

58:41.640 --> 58:45.040
 and evaluating which brain areas are active

58:45.040 --> 58:47.000
 when we eat certain foods were done

58:47.000 --> 58:49.800
 by Dr. Dana Small's lab at Yale University

58:49.800 --> 58:53.120
 and in some of her previous work when she was elsewhere,

58:53.120 --> 58:55.120
 and of course, by other laboratories too.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.680
 And they used an approach called

58:56.680 --> 58:58.640
 positron emission tomography,

58:58.640 --> 59:02.480
 and they and others have used PET scanning,

59:02.480 --> 59:05.500
 as it's called, positron emission tomography,

59:05.500 --> 59:08.440
 along with a tool called 2-Deoxyglucose.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.600
 2-Deoxyglucose is actually involved

59:10.600 --> 59:13.440
 in the procedure of seeing which brain areas are active

59:13.440 --> 59:16.480
 when people eat foods or engage in other types of behaviors.

59:16.480 --> 59:21.280
 But the way that 2-Deoxyglucose sometimes shorten 2-DG,

59:21.280 --> 59:25.520
 the way that it works is to block glucose uptake

59:25.520 --> 59:29.680
 from neurons and instead bring along with it

59:29.680 --> 59:32.400
 a marker that one can see through imaging.

59:32.400 --> 59:35.600
 So in other words, a tool for looking at what parts

59:35.600 --> 59:39.080
 of the brain are active when eating particular foods

59:39.080 --> 59:42.560
 actually prevents foods such as sugar

59:42.560 --> 59:46.900
 from allowing glucose to get into particular neurons.

59:46.900 --> 59:48.960
 Now, that might seem like a bad situation.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.480
 You'd say, well, wait, you're trying to understand

59:50.480 --> 59:52.480
 how sugar works in the brain,

59:52.480 --> 59:56.400
 and then you block the ability for sugar glucose

59:56.400 --> 59:59.720
 to bind to or be used by these neurons

59:59.720 --> 1:00:01.500
 because of the thing that you're using for the experiment.

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.380
 Exactly, it's a huge problem,

1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:04.640
 but it turns out to be a huge problem

1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:06.080
 that led to a great insight.

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:08.460
 And the great insight is this.

1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:11.920
 The preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids

1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:16.920
 is actually blocked by 2-Deoxyglucose.

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:19.240
 What that means experimentally,

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:21.520
 but also in terms of what it means for you and me

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:23.840
 in the real world is that there's yet

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:27.760
 a third parallel pathway that's related

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:32.760
 to the use of blood sugar, the use of glucose by neurons

1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:37.760
 that further reinforces our desire to eat more sweet things.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:40.860
 And the preference for sweet foods

1:00:40.860 --> 1:00:45.400
 can actually be eliminated through 2-Deoxyglucose.

1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:48.340
 Now, I definitely don't want people going out

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:49.820
 and consuming 2-Deoxyglucose.

1:00:49.820 --> 1:00:51.020
 This is a laboratory tool.

1:00:51.020 --> 1:00:54.000
 It is not something that you should be ingesting.

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.100
 So don't go look it up and try and get some.

1:00:56.100 --> 1:00:58.140
 There might be other uses for it, but that's not the point.

1:00:58.140 --> 1:01:03.140
 The point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods.

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:06.820
 It is the signals coming from your gut,

1:01:06.820 --> 1:01:09.420
 from your digestive tract to your brain.

1:01:09.420 --> 1:01:13.820
 And it's the use of the metabolic consequences

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:18.580
 of sugary foods that are acting as a three-pronged push

1:01:18.580 --> 1:01:21.800
 on your desire to consume more sugary foods.

1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:24.740
 So this car analogy that I used before

1:01:24.740 --> 1:01:27.020
 where it's some weird car that has two accelerators,

1:01:27.020 --> 1:01:29.360
 it actually has three accelerators.

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.980
 And so with three accelerators,

1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:34.300
 all pushing the system hard, we can say,

1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:36.740
 wow, there must be something really special

1:01:36.740 --> 1:01:37.580
 about this pathway.

1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:38.660
 And indeed there is.

1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:41.660
 This pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain

1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:42.720
 and the rest of the nervous system.

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.460
 It's the preferred source of fuel

1:01:44.460 --> 1:01:45.900
 for the brain and nervous system.

1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:47.240
 And I realized, as I say that,

1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:49.180
 all the ketonistas are probably going,

1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:51.340
 no, actually ketones are the preferred source.

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:52.780
 Okay, I acknowledge that.

1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.260
 There are conditions under which

1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:56.100
 you can bring your blood glucose very low,

1:01:56.100 --> 1:01:57.280
 and there are reasons to do that.

1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:00.780
 Actually ketosis has been a terrifically successful

1:02:00.780 --> 1:02:02.680
 treatment for a lot of forms of epilepsy,

1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:04.900
 in particular, pediatric epilepsy.

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:08.540
 Many people do derive benefit from ketogenic diets,

1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:10.660
 so I'm not knocking ketogenic diets,

1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:14.500
 but if you were to look at what neurons normally prefer,

1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:19.500
 meaning in a typical diet regimen, it would be glucose.

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:22.220
 And the fact that fructose

1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:23.920
 is eventually converted to glucose,

1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:25.700
 the fact that when we ingest sucrose,

1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:27.860
 it's eventually converted into a fuel that neurons can use,

1:02:27.860 --> 1:02:30.020
 that's very much in the glucose pathway.

1:02:30.020 --> 1:02:31.940
 What you basically arrive at is the fact

1:02:31.940 --> 1:02:34.940
 that your nervous system is a glucose consuming machine,

1:02:34.940 --> 1:02:37.060
 and you've got at least three pathways

1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:40.520
 of which I've described that are pushing on your brain,

1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:42.060
 consciously and subconsciously,

1:02:42.060 --> 1:02:45.140
 to get you to seek and consume more sugar.

1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:48.060
 Now that all sounds like a pretty depressing picture,

1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:49.100
 at least for those of you that are trying

1:02:49.100 --> 1:02:50.320
 to reduce your sugar intake.

1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:53.060
 And of course, we can all reduce sugar intake

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:54.380
 by way of sheer will.

1:02:54.380 --> 1:02:56.440
 We can not have those foods at home.

1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:58.340
 We can restrict ourselves from those.

1:02:58.340 --> 1:03:01.300
 But there are some things that we all can

1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:04.980
 and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways,

1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:08.380
 such that we don't feel so controlled by them,

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:11.300
 but rather that we control their output.

1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:12.920
 And of course they are us and we are them.

1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:15.580
 So this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness

1:03:15.580 --> 1:03:17.540
 and free will that I certainly don't want to cover

1:03:17.540 --> 1:03:18.860
 in this episode.

1:03:18.860 --> 1:03:22.740
 But nonetheless, I think once you understand

1:03:22.740 --> 1:03:24.580
 that these circuits exist,

1:03:24.580 --> 1:03:28.100
 and you understand that there are simple substitutions

1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:31.540
 and modifications that one can make to their food intake

1:03:31.540 --> 1:03:34.780
 that can work within these pathways

1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:37.140
 and even bypass some of these pathways,

1:03:37.140 --> 1:03:39.380
 you start to realize that you have a lot more control

1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:42.620
 over sugar intake and sugar appetite

1:03:42.620 --> 1:03:44.140
 than you previously thought.

1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:46.540
 Now, many of you have heard of the so-called glycemic index.

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:48.340
 The glycemic index is a measure

1:03:48.340 --> 1:03:49.960
 of how quickly blood sugar rises

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:51.940
 after ingesting particular foods

1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:53.940
 and very broadly speaking,

1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:56.940
 we can say that there are low glycemic index foods

1:03:56.940 --> 1:04:00.040
 of less than 55 typically is the measurement

1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:01.900
 or medium glycemic index foods,

1:04:01.900 --> 1:04:03.900
 which go from about 55 to 69

1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:06.860
 and then so-called high glycemic foods, which are above 70.

1:04:06.860 --> 1:04:08.880
 And of course there's additional nuance

1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:10.900
 related to glycemic load

1:04:10.900 --> 1:04:14.940
 and many more features of the glycemic index.

1:04:14.940 --> 1:04:16.180
 A couple of things to understand

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:18.740
 about how the glycemic index is measured.

1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:21.000
 And then I'd like to just briefly talk about

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.860
 how the glycemic index can be leveraged

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:27.340
 to short circuit some of the neural circuits

1:04:27.340 --> 1:04:29.760
 that would otherwise lead us to crave

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:33.060
 and perhaps even ingest sugary foods.

1:04:33.060 --> 1:04:37.740
 First of all, measurements of glycemic indices of food

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:39.520
 are typically made by having people

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:41.780
 ingest those foods in isolation.

1:04:41.780 --> 1:04:46.420
 And in general, we can say that anytime we ingest fiber

1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:49.840
 and or fat lipids along with a particular food,

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:53.840
 it will reduce the glycemic index of that particular food,

1:04:53.840 --> 1:04:57.340
 either the absolute level of blood glucose

1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.100
 that a particular food causes

1:05:00.100 --> 1:05:05.060
 or the rate at which that elevation in blood glucose occurs.

1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:07.180
 And this is why there are some

1:05:07.180 --> 1:05:10.300
 seemingly paradoxical aspects to sweet stuff

1:05:10.300 --> 1:05:11.420
 in terms of the glycemic index.

1:05:11.420 --> 1:05:14.480
 For instance, ice cream has a lower glycemic index

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:16.440
 provided it's ice cream that includes fat,

1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:17.280
 which I hope it would

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:19.400
 because that's the good tasting ice cream in my opinion.

1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:23.120
 Compared to something like mangoes or table sugar, right?

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:26.140
 So the glycemic index is not something

1:05:26.140 --> 1:05:28.060
 to hold wholly in most cases

1:05:28.060 --> 1:05:31.020
 because most people are not ingesting foods in isolation.

1:05:31.020 --> 1:05:32.480
 And there's actually a lot of argument

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:33.940
 as to whether or not the glycemic index

1:05:33.940 --> 1:05:38.180
 is really as vital as some people claim.

1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:40.160
 There's also the context in which you

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:41.180
 ingest particular foods.

1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:42.620
 As I mentioned earlier,

1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:45.020
 after I do hard training of any kind,

1:05:45.020 --> 1:05:46.860
 meaning training that ought to deplete glycogen,

1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:48.060
 so hard resistance training,

1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:50.100
 I actually make it a point to ingest

1:05:50.100 --> 1:05:53.260
 some very sweet high glycemic foods like a mango.

1:05:53.260 --> 1:05:54.700
 I'll also ingest some starches

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:56.060
 because I'm trying to replenish glycogen.

1:05:56.060 --> 1:05:58.740
 I'm also trying to spike my blood sugar a little bit

1:05:58.740 --> 1:06:00.020
 because that can be advantageous

1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:01.140
 in terms of certain strength

1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:03.160
 and hypertrophy protocols, et cetera.

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:05.440
 But most of the time I'm avoiding these high glycemic foods

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:06.280
 and high sugar foods.

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:07.540
 I should point that out.

1:06:07.540 --> 1:06:09.680
 Now, why am I telling you about the glycemic index?

1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:13.260
 Well, if we zoom out and take our perspective

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:15.640
 on all of this discussion about the glycemic index

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:18.060
 through the lens of the nervous system,

1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:21.520
 and we remind ourselves that neurons prefer glucose

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:24.220
 for energy and that all sweet things

1:06:24.220 --> 1:06:25.620
 or things that we perceive as sweet,

1:06:25.620 --> 1:06:27.860
 but also sweet things that are ingested

1:06:27.860 --> 1:06:30.500
 and registered by those neuro pod cells in our gut

1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:32.420
 trigger the release of dopamine

1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:34.360
 and trigger these neural circuits

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:36.960
 to make us want to eat more of these foods.

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:38.860
 What we start to realize is that

1:06:38.860 --> 1:06:40.840
 a sharp rise in blood glucose

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:44.940
 or a very high degree of elevation in blood glucose

1:06:44.940 --> 1:06:47.860
 is going to be a much more potent signal

1:06:47.860 --> 1:06:51.580
 than will a more moderate rise in blood glucose

1:06:51.580 --> 1:06:54.860
 or a slower rise in blood glucose.

1:06:54.860 --> 1:06:58.180
 So if we think about the analogy of three accelerators,

1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:00.100
 meaning three parallel neural circuits,

1:07:00.100 --> 1:07:03.220
 all essentially there to get us to seek out

1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:07.220
 and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods,

1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:10.980
 well then the glycemic index is sort of our measurement

1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:12.900
 of how hard we are pushing down

1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:16.460
 or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators.

1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:19.500
 And so those of you that are trying to reduce sugar intake,

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:22.000
 and you want to do that through an understanding

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.500
 of how these neural circuits work,

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:26.580
 and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release

1:07:26.580 --> 1:07:30.100
 that's caused by ingesting sugary foods,

1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:35.100
 it can be advantageous to ingest sweet foods

1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:38.940
 either alone or in combination with foods

1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:42.860
 that reduce glycemic index or reduce glycemic load.

1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:45.980
 So that might mean making different food choices.

1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:48.760
 So paying attention to sweet tasting foods

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:50.800
 that can satisfy sugar cravings,

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:52.860
 but do not have as steep,

1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:54.300
 or I should say do not cause

1:07:54.300 --> 1:07:55.980
 a steeper rise in blood sugar,

1:07:55.980 --> 1:07:59.220
 or it could mean consuming other foods

1:07:59.220 --> 1:08:02.060
 along with sweet foods in order to reduce

1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:04.900
 the glycemic index and thereby slow

1:08:04.900 --> 1:08:07.320
 or blunt the release of dopamine.

1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:09.260
 You might think, well, why would I want to do that?

1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:11.640
 I want the maximum dopamine output

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:13.260
 in response to a given sweet food.

1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:15.440
 I don't just want the level 10,

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:18.040
 I want the level 100 output of dopamine,

1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:20.560
 but you really don't because of the pleasure pain balance

1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:21.660
 that dopamine causes.

1:08:21.660 --> 1:08:24.940
 And in fact, if we consider some of the non-food substances

1:08:24.940 --> 1:08:27.260
 that really push hard on these dopamine pathways,

1:08:27.260 --> 1:08:29.840
 we can come up with a somewhat sinister,

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:31.820
 but nonetheless appropriate analogy.

1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:37.540
 The drug cocaine causes very robust potent increases

1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:39.480
 in dopamine within the brain,

1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:42.860
 and typically causes people to want to ingest more cocaine

1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:47.240
 because of those sharp increases in dopamine.

1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:50.100
 But within the category of the drug cocaine,

1:08:50.100 --> 1:08:52.080
 there are various modes of ingestion.

1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:53.680
 Some people inhale it,

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:57.480
 some people will inject it intravenously,

1:08:57.480 --> 1:08:58.860
 some people will smoke it.

1:08:58.860 --> 1:09:02.080
 And those different forms of taking cocaine

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:04.900
 actually impact the dopamine circuits differently.

1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:07.640
 And it turns out that crack cocaine,

1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:11.220
 the smokable form of cocaine rock,

1:09:11.220 --> 1:09:13.900
 increases dopamine to a very high degree,

1:09:13.900 --> 1:09:16.220
 but also very, very quickly.

1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:20.520
 And it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time,

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:23.360
 not so much the absolute level of dopamine

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:27.400
 that makes crack cocaine so absolutely addictive.

1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:30.360
 So sometimes you'll hear, you know, sugar is like crack.

1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:32.100
 Well, that's getting a little extreme

1:09:32.100 --> 1:09:34.020
 because even though I don't think the measurements

1:09:34.020 --> 1:09:36.060
 have been done in the same experiment,

1:09:36.060 --> 1:09:37.640
 I think it's reasonable to think

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:40.380
 that the absolute level of dopamine

1:09:40.380 --> 1:09:42.800
 caused by ingesting sugar, at least for most people,

1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:45.500
 is not going to be as high as the absolute level

1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:48.360
 of dopamine caused by smoking crack.

1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:49.460
 Of course, it goes without saying,

1:09:49.460 --> 1:09:52.120
 please don't do cocaine in any form, by the way.

1:09:53.660 --> 1:09:56.000
 It is appropriate to say

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.660
 that the rate of dopamine increase over time

1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:03.920
 has a profound effect on how people will

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:07.520
 and if people will go on to want to pursue more

1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:10.100
 of what caused that increase in dopamine.

1:10:10.100 --> 1:10:11.740
 So what I'm basically saying is

1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:14.100
 if you're going to ingest sweet foods

1:10:14.100 --> 1:10:17.020
 in order to satisfy a sweet craving,

1:10:18.340 --> 1:10:22.300
 ingesting sweet foods for which the glycemic index is lower

1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:26.020
 or in which you've adjusted those glycemic index foods

1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:29.140
 through the co-ingestion of fiber or maybe fat

1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:31.580
 might be beneficial.

1:10:31.580 --> 1:10:34.460
 So is this justification for putting peanut butter

1:10:34.460 --> 1:10:38.220
 on that piece of chocolate or for having a bowl of ice cream

1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:41.140
 along with the mango that you're craving?

1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:42.440
 In some sense, yes.

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.360
 However, there's also the issue of how sweet

1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:48.280
 and how delicious something tastes.

1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:51.700
 Highly palatable foods, absolutely delicious foods,

1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:55.660
 trigger that one neural circuit, that one accelerator

1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:57.300
 that we're talking about in terms of our analogy

1:10:57.300 --> 1:10:58.900
 of three accelerators.

1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:01.820
 And the more delicious something tastes within our mouth,

1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:04.620
 the further increase in dopamine.

1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:07.860
 So if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings

1:11:07.860 --> 1:11:12.580
 and you really still want to ingest some sugary foods,

1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:15.500
 you probably would be better off combining fiber

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:17.940
 with that sugary or sweet food.

1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:19.900
 Now, I do realize that it's somewhat unusual

1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:22.260
 and you probably get some strange stares

1:11:22.260 --> 1:11:25.020
 if you decided to consume broccoli, for instance,

1:11:25.020 --> 1:11:27.760
 along with your chocolate or with another dessert

1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:30.940
 that would otherwise cause a steep increase in blood sugar

1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:32.660
 and has a high glycemic index.

1:11:32.660 --> 1:11:35.880
 But nonetheless, if your goal is to blunt

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:38.380
 your sugar cravings, what you really need to do

1:11:38.380 --> 1:11:40.300
 is blunt that dopamine increase.

1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:42.260
 So what we're really talking about here

1:11:42.260 --> 1:11:45.120
 is trying to reduce the dopamine signal

1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:47.700
 that is the consequence of ingesting sweet foods.

1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:49.040
 And we're talking about doing that

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:50.820
 through these different parallel pathways,

1:11:50.820 --> 1:11:52.920
 not just by preventing sweet taste,

1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:55.740
 but also by preventing the post-ingestive effects

1:11:55.740 --> 1:11:57.720
 of sweet foods.

1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:00.620
 And of course, the backdrop to all of this

1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:03.260
 is that most of us, again, most of us, not all of us,

1:12:03.260 --> 1:12:06.760
 should probably be ingesting fewer refined sugars.

1:12:07.620 --> 1:12:09.600
 Certainly there are exceptions to that,

1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:13.020
 but I think the bulk of data point to the fact

1:12:13.020 --> 1:12:15.540
 that ingesting these highly palatable,

1:12:15.540 --> 1:12:17.860
 certainly highly palatable, highly processed foods

1:12:17.860 --> 1:12:21.320
 or foods that contain a lot of high fructose corn syrup

1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:23.020
 can be really deleterious to our health,

1:12:23.020 --> 1:12:24.740
 especially in kids.

1:12:24.740 --> 1:12:27.580
 And I'm not going to cite off a bunch of statistics.

1:12:27.580 --> 1:12:31.020
 You've all heard them before that for hundreds of years,

1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:34.540
 we ingested the equivalent of a few cups

1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:36.280
 or pounds of sugar per year.

1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:38.820
 And now people are ingesting hundreds of pounds

1:12:38.820 --> 1:12:40.300
 of sugar per year.

1:12:40.300 --> 1:12:43.680
 The major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks,

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:44.620
 meaning soft drinks.

1:12:44.620 --> 1:12:46.320
 And I think indeed that's the case.

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:49.640
 I do want to point out the incredible work

1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:52.800
 of Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:54.860
 at University of California, San Francisco,

1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:58.180
 who was really early in the game of voicing the dangers

1:12:58.180 --> 1:13:00.500
 of so-called hidden sugars and highly processed foods.

1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:03.620
 There are other people, of course, now talking about this.

1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:06.580
 His laboratory has done important work showing,

1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:10.100
 for instance, that if high fructose corn syrup

1:13:10.100 --> 1:13:13.100
 or even just fructose is replaced with glucose,

1:13:13.100 --> 1:13:16.660
 even if the same number of calories is ingested,

1:13:16.660 --> 1:13:19.260
 that there are important,

1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:23.380
 meaning significant reductions in type two diabetes,

1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:25.140
 some of the metabolic syndromes associated

1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:28.000
 with high fructose corn syrup and on and on and on.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.640
 And of course there are other culprits in type two diabetes.

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:33.860
 There are other factors that are going to lead to obesity,

1:13:33.860 --> 1:13:36.400
 but I think the work from Lustig and others

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:39.160
 has really illustrated that we should all be trying

1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:42.380
 to reduce our intake of highly refined sugars

1:13:42.380 --> 1:13:44.240
 and high fructose corn syrup,

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.620
 and certainly trying to reduce our intake

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:51.240
 of very sugary drinks, not just soft drinks,

1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:53.900
 but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar.

1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:56.060
 Now, even for people that are of healthy weight

1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:58.340
 and who don't have metabolic syndromes,

1:13:58.340 --> 1:14:00.160
 there may be an additional reason

1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:03.640
 to not want to ingest very sweet foods

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:05.180
 and highly refined sugars.

1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:08.180
 And this has to do with a new and emerging area

1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:11.020
 of nutrition neuroscience.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.660
 And I want to point out that these are new data, right?

1:14:14.660 --> 1:14:15.640
 So it's not a lock.

1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:17.560
 The double-blind placebo-controlled studies

1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:20.280
 in large populations have not been finished.

1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:23.380
 So I want to make sure that that's clear,

1:14:23.380 --> 1:14:25.320
 but I also want to make clear

1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:27.340
 what some of the really exciting data

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:29.720
 coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale

1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.960
 and from other laboratories are showing.

1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.880
 And this has to do with what's called

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:36.040
 conditioned taste preference.

1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:38.620
 Using a kind of Pavlovian paradigm,

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:40.920
 what they do is they have people,

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.760
 and these studies were done in people,

1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:45.920
 ingest maltodextrin, which increases blood glucose.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:46.960
 Doesn't have much flavor,

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:49.760
 but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor,

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:53.640
 the maltodextrin is cloaked by some other flavor.

1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:56.280
 And by cloaking it with that other flavor

1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:57.900
 or pairing it with that other flavor,

1:14:57.900 --> 1:14:59.840
 what they find is that over time,

1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:02.340
 because the maltodextrin increases blood glucose

1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:04.000
 and they're ingesting a particular flavor

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000
 along with that maltodextrin,

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.080
 they can then remove the maltodextrin

1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:13.800
 and the flavor will induce an increase in insulin.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.320
 The increase in insulin, of course,

1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:16.960
 is the consequence of the fact

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.740
 that anytime there's a rise in blood glucose,

1:15:18.740 --> 1:15:20.380
 provided the person isn't diabetic,

1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:25.220
 there's a parallel increase in insulin.

1:15:25.220 --> 1:15:28.400
 Now, this is very interesting because what it says is,

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:31.600
 well, at a first pass, it says that we are very Pavlovian

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.880
 in terms of our physiological responses to foods

1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:37.620
 and particular flavors come to be associated

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:41.220
 with particular patterns of blood glucose increase

1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:44.280
 and hence patterns of insulin increase

1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:47.240
 because of course insulin manages glucose in the bloodstream,

1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:51.400
 as I mentioned earlier, this also has implications

1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:53.840
 for understanding things like artificial sweeteners.

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:55.780
 And here, I want to highlight that this is still

1:15:55.780 --> 1:15:58.200
 very controversial work and needs more data,

1:15:58.200 --> 1:15:59.520
 but nonetheless, I'd like to share it

1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:01.060
 with you for consideration.

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:06.620
 The small laboratory has done studies in humans,

1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:08.600
 both in adults and in children,

1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:13.020
 showing that if the flavor of artificial sweeteners

1:16:13.020 --> 1:16:14.800
 is paired with maltodextrin,

1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:17.400
 and then the maltodextrin is removed,

1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:20.880
 that the artificial sweetener taste itself

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:24.440
 can subsequently increase insulin in the bloodstream.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:29.000
 In other words, taking something that increases blood sugar,

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.880
 attaching a flavor experience to that,

1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:35.240
 having children or adults ingest that thing,

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:39.680
 allows the nervous system to associate that flavor

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:41.520
 with that increase in blood glucose,

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:45.160
 but then you can remove the glucose increasing substance

1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:47.580
 and the flavor alone will increase insulin

1:16:47.580 --> 1:16:50.160
 because insulin typically follows blood glucose.

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:52.000
 So this is a conditioning effect.

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.960
 Now, the reason these data are controversial

1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:54.800
 is several fold.

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.120
 First of all, the landscape around the discussion

1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.560
 around artificial sweeteners is definitely

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:04.640
 what I would call a barbed wire topic.

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:06.560
 And I want to preface what I'm about to say next

1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:09.220
 by saying I actually ingest artificial sweeteners.

1:17:09.220 --> 1:17:12.280
 I will have the occasional diet soda, not every day,

1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:13.960
 maybe, I don't know, once or twice a month.

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.080
 I don't particularly like the taste,

1:17:15.080 --> 1:17:16.480
 but I'll do it just because it's around

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:18.880
 and I want some caffeine and I like the carbonation

1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:20.560
 if I'm on a plane or something.

1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:24.480
 I do ingest plant-based non-caloric sweeteners.

1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:27.440
 To my knowledge, there have not been high quality studies

1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:29.480
 of plant-based non-caloric sweeteners

1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:32.440
 in the context that I'm referring to here, okay?

1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:35.440
 Nonetheless, these studies show that particular flavors

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:38.800
 can be conditioned to cause an insulin increase

1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:42.600
 and the flavor associated with certain artificial sweeteners

1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:46.160
 is included in that category of flavors

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:48.800
 that can induce insulin even in the absence

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.640
 of something that can increase blood glucose.

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:54.620
 Now, the simple takeaway from these studies

1:17:54.620 --> 1:17:56.520
 would be the following.

1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:58.680
 And this is actually the one interpretation

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:00.880
 that Dana Small has offered to her data,

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.920
 but she offers other interpretations as well.

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:07.520
 One interpretation is that if people are going to ingest

1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:10.680
 artificial sweeteners and they do that along with foods

1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:14.100
 that very sharply increase blood glucose,

1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:17.740
 then there is the potential, highlight the potential

1:18:17.740 --> 1:18:21.900
 for those same artificial sweeteners to increase insulin

1:18:21.900 --> 1:18:24.720
 even in the absence of food.

1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:26.580
 In other words, let's just draw the scenario out

1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:27.480
 in the real world.

1:18:28.820 --> 1:18:31.760
 You're having a diet soda

1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:35.240
 along with a cheeseburger and fries.

1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:37.400
 You do that every day for lunch, okay?

1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:39.920
 This somewhat extreme example, but natural world example.

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:41.040
 You do that every day for lunch

1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:43.500
 and then you just have a diet soda alone.

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:47.680
 The extreme interpretation of the data

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:49.320
 that they've collected says, well,

1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:51.420
 that diet soda alone will increase insulin

1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:53.840
 even though there's no increase in blood glucose

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:55.020
 because you haven't ingested food with it

1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:58.600
 because you conditioned that taste of artificial sweetener

1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:02.200
 to the experience of a rise in glucose and hence insulin.

1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:04.800
 Now, the counter argument to this would be,

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:06.760
 well, that's a very unusual situation.

1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:10.080
 Maltodextrin causes big increases in blood glucose,

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:12.760
 so that's not really a fair experiment

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:14.360
 or it's not a natural world experiment.

1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:16.320
 And I think that's a decent assessment,

1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.320
 although I will point out that one of the reasons

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:21.800
 why this study is so controversial

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:23.440
 or why these data are so controversial

1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:26.240
 is that the experiment actually had to be stopped

1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:27.840
 and particularly the experiment in children

1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:32.300
 had to be stopped because the changes in insulin

1:19:32.300 --> 1:19:36.520
 that were observed early in the study were so detrimental

1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:39.720
 that the institutional review board quite appropriately

1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:41.300
 said, we can't do this to these kids.

1:19:41.300 --> 1:19:44.600
 They're experiencing these odd shifts in insulin

1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:46.720
 that are not healthy for them

1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:48.760
 when they're just ingesting artificial sweeteners

1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:51.800
 in the absence of these glucose increasing foods.

1:19:51.800 --> 1:19:55.040
 So once again, I do ingest artificial sweeteners.

1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:56.280
 I'm not saying that they are dangerous.

1:19:56.280 --> 1:19:58.600
 I'm not saying that they are not dangerous.

1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:00.900
 I'm saying that you have to decide for yourself.

1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:02.440
 In previous episodes, I've highlighted

1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:05.580
 that artificial sweeteners have been shown

1:20:05.580 --> 1:20:09.880
 in studies of animals that when given in very high doses,

1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:11.880
 sucralose in particular,

1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:16.400
 there can be fairly robust disruption to the gut microbiome,

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:18.520
 which is vital for immune health and brain health,

1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:20.120
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:24.040
 But thus far our knowledge of how artificial sweeteners

1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:26.760
 negatively impacts or positively impacts, I should say,

1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:31.760
 the microbiome and other deleterious effects on the body

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:36.080
 has mainly been explored in animal studies.

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:39.360
 Again, the work by Dana Small has been done in humans.

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:41.980
 There's some parallel work by others in animal models.

1:20:41.980 --> 1:20:45.540
 I bring it up today to illustrate the following point.

1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:49.220
 Normally we have a pathway

1:20:49.220 --> 1:20:50.980
 that we don't have to condition at all.

1:20:50.980 --> 1:20:52.620
 It's there from birth,

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:55.100
 whereby ingestion of sweet foods

1:20:55.100 --> 1:20:57.620
 causes increases in dopamine.

1:20:57.620 --> 1:20:59.620
 And there are parallel pathways

1:20:59.620 --> 1:21:03.500
 by which neurons in our gut and elsewhere in our body

1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:05.800
 trigger further increases in dopamine.

1:21:07.340 --> 1:21:10.240
 So there's no need for a conditioned response

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.600
 or to become Pavlovian about this, right?

1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:15.540
 You're hardwired to want to eat sweet things

1:21:15.540 --> 1:21:18.580
 by at least two and probably three parallel pathways.

1:21:18.580 --> 1:21:21.600
 Now, the work from Dana Small's lab and others

1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:24.860
 that have illustrated this condition flavor preference,

1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:27.980
 I think beautifully show that any flavor

1:21:27.980 --> 1:21:30.640
 that's associated with a glucose spike

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:34.340
 or a long sustained increase in glucose

1:21:34.340 --> 1:21:35.900
 can also be conditioned.

1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:38.020
 In other words, the circuits for dopamine

1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:40.540
 that reinforce the desire to eat particular things

1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:42.380
 is not unique to the sugar pathway.

1:21:42.380 --> 1:21:45.440
 And this is one of the reasons, I believe,

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:47.840
 why ingestion of sweet foods

1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:50.580
 doesn't just lead us to want to eat more sweet foods.

1:21:50.580 --> 1:21:52.200
 I think that is absolutely clear

1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.540
 based on animal data and on human data.

1:21:54.540 --> 1:21:55.500
 I think that's robust.

1:21:55.500 --> 1:22:00.500
 It's actually the stuff of textbooks now, but in addition,

1:22:00.500 --> 1:22:03.940
 ingesting sweet foods and or foods that raise blood glucose,

1:22:03.940 --> 1:22:05.780
 but that we don't perceive as sweet.

1:22:05.780 --> 1:22:08.300
 So for instance, foods with hidden sugars,

1:22:08.300 --> 1:22:10.980
 sugars that have been masked by salty or spicy tastes

1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:14.900
 increases our desire for glucose elevating foods

1:22:14.900 --> 1:22:16.900
 and food generally.

1:22:16.900 --> 1:22:20.060
 I think that's the only logical interpretation of the data

1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:21.580
 that I can arrive at.

1:22:21.580 --> 1:22:23.800
 So for people that struggle with regulating their appetite

1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:26.220
 or with regulating their sugar appetite,

1:22:26.220 --> 1:22:29.100
 I think the understanding of conditioned flavor preference

1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:32.100
 while a little bit complicated ought to be useful

1:22:32.100 --> 1:22:34.700
 in trying to navigate reducing sugar cravings

1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:35.780
 and sugar intake.

1:22:35.780 --> 1:22:38.360
 As a segue into tools to control sugar intake

1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:42.540
 as a means to both regulate sugar intake itself,

1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:44.380
 as well as food intake overall

1:22:44.380 --> 1:22:46.380
 and steer us towards healthier choices.

1:22:47.220 --> 1:22:50.400
 I'd like to talk about some of the special populations

1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:52.860
 out there that might want to be especially wary

1:22:52.860 --> 1:22:57.680
 of having a dysregulated sugar appetite system.

1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:00.020
 And the group I'm referring to specifically

1:23:00.020 --> 1:23:03.200
 are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:06.960
 or I should say, and or people who have issues

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:08.940
 with focus and attention generally.

1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:10.260
 And I think more and more nowadays,

1:23:10.260 --> 1:23:13.020
 I'm hearing that people are having a hard time focusing.

1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:15.980
 This probably has something to do with our interactions

1:23:15.980 --> 1:23:17.240
 with electronic devices.

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:19.620
 As I always say, if a picture is worth a thousand words,

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:22.500
 a movie is worth a million pictures,

1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:25.180
 and the fact that we can access so many movies

1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:27.140
 in just by scrolling with our thumb

1:23:27.140 --> 1:23:28.220
 is something that the nervous system

1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:30.780
 has just never contended with before in human history.

1:23:30.780 --> 1:23:32.320
 I'm confident in that.

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:34.260
 And it's not that it can't deal with it.

1:23:34.260 --> 1:23:36.140
 The question is, what's the trade-off?

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:38.620
 You know, what are the consequences of that?

1:23:38.620 --> 1:23:41.740
 So attention and ability to focus

1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:43.940
 is obviously key to success in school,

1:23:43.940 --> 1:23:45.100
 success in relationships,

1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:48.340
 success in the workplace and success in life.

1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:50.140
 We could probably even go so far as to say

1:23:50.140 --> 1:23:53.420
 one's ability to succeed in anything

1:23:53.420 --> 1:23:55.600
 is proportional to one's ability to focus

1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:57.300
 and then deliberately defocus

1:23:57.300 --> 1:23:58.940
 when the time comes to defocus, right?

1:23:58.940 --> 1:24:00.820
 Because we all need rest and we need to disengage

1:24:00.820 --> 1:24:01.740
 and then re-engage.

1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:07.880
 If you look at the sum total of the meta-analyses

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:12.100
 and the clinical data on ADHD and nutrition,

1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:14.140
 you arrive at a pretty clear answer,

1:24:14.140 --> 1:24:16.160
 which is that sugar consumption,

1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:18.020
 in particular highly refined sugars,

1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:21.060
 is just not good for people with ADHD

1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:22.780
 or with attentional issues.

1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:25.420
 Now, as I say that, I also want you to recall

1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:27.140
 the earlier study that I referred to

1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:29.420
 whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain

1:24:29.420 --> 1:24:30.980
 is highly dependent on glucose.

1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:34.080
 So this doesn't mean consuming no glucose

1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:35.100
 is going to be a good idea.

1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:37.560
 It doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet

1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:40.340
 is necessarily the best diet for ADHD,

1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:42.500
 although there are some people pursuing that

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:43.340
 and exploring that.

1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:46.340
 And we'll do yet another episode on ADHD at some point

1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:47.860
 that goes a little bit deeper into that

1:24:47.860 --> 1:24:48.860
 because there's some new data.

1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:53.860
 I did do a very long and fairly extensive episode on ADHD.

1:24:54.420 --> 1:24:56.260
 You're welcome to look that up if you like

1:24:56.260 --> 1:24:59.620
 in our archive, excuse me, in our archive

1:24:59.620 --> 1:25:01.060
 at hubermanlab.com.

1:25:02.540 --> 1:25:03.500
 It's all timestamped.

1:25:03.500 --> 1:25:05.700
 So, you know, because a number of people said,

1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:07.460
 oh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD

1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:08.680
 and you made it two and a half hours long.

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:11.660
 Yes, we did because we wanted it to be as comprehensive

1:25:11.660 --> 1:25:14.180
 as we could at the time, but it is timestamped.

1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:16.180
 So you can just jump to the particular topics of interest

1:25:16.180 --> 1:25:18.500
 in their short little cassettes there.

1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:21.220
 Now, if you'd like to know upon what I'm basing

1:25:21.220 --> 1:25:23.900
 the statement that sugar consumption

1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:25.780
 and highly refined sugar consumption

1:25:25.780 --> 1:25:28.300
 is potentially bad for ADHD,

1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:31.520
 basing this mainly on the conclusions

1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:33.020
 of a really nice paper,

1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:35.940
 the title of the paper is sugar consumption,

1:25:35.940 --> 1:25:37.260
 sugar sweetened beverages

1:25:37.260 --> 1:25:39.340
 and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1:25:39.340 --> 1:25:41.220
 a systematic review and meta analysis.

1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:44.380
 And this is a paper, we'll put a link to this

1:25:44.380 --> 1:25:45.600
 in the caption.

1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:48.740
 This was publishing complimentary therapies in medicine,

1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:51.020
 which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense,

1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:53.380
 but I really like this meta analysis.

1:25:53.380 --> 1:25:58.380
 The sum total of this meta analysis is really that

1:25:58.460 --> 1:26:03.460
 when especially kids get beyond four sugary drinks per week,

1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:07.100
 so four sodas of, you know, typical 12 ounce soda,

1:26:07.100 --> 1:26:10.100
 when they get past four 12 ounce sugary sodas,

1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:11.500
 they didn't, as far as I know,

1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:14.140
 look at artificial sweetened sodas.

1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:15.700
 That's when you start to see

1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:18.900
 a shift towards more negative outcomes,

1:26:18.900 --> 1:26:21.940
 more symptoms of existing ADHD.

1:26:21.940 --> 1:26:24.020
 Now where the controversy comes in

1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:26.180
 is whether or not sugar consumption

1:26:26.180 --> 1:26:29.020
 can actually trigger or cause ADHD.

1:26:29.020 --> 1:26:32.140
 And I don't think we can conclude that at all at this time.

1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:35.260
 And this review, if you decide to check it out,

1:26:35.260 --> 1:26:37.260
 review slash meta analysis, I should say,

1:26:37.260 --> 1:26:38.420
 if you decide to check it out,

1:26:38.420 --> 1:26:40.820
 goes into some of the nuance around that.

1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:45.260
 What's also interesting in terms of ADHD and sugar intake,

1:26:45.260 --> 1:26:47.120
 and probably has relevance to all of us,

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.620
 is that they also cover some of the interesting data

1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:53.960
 showing that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids

1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:57.100
 can actually be beneficial for people

1:26:57.100 --> 1:26:59.340
 and particular kids with ADHD.

1:26:59.340 --> 1:27:02.420
 I've talked before about the utility of omega-3s

1:27:02.420 --> 1:27:03.820
 that's been shown in various studies

1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:06.420
 that have compared omega-3 fatty acid intake

1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:09.860
 to say prescription antidepressants, like SSRIs,

1:27:09.860 --> 1:27:12.740
 like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, fluoxetine.

1:27:12.740 --> 1:27:15.140
 And the results of those studies are pretty clear,

1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:18.380
 at least to me, that provided that one gets

1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:21.620
 at least one gram of EPA essential fatty acids,

1:27:21.620 --> 1:27:23.380
 so it's not just getting one gram per day,

1:27:23.380 --> 1:27:25.860
 but one or more grams per day

1:27:25.860 --> 1:27:28.520
 of the EPA form of essential fatty acid

1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:30.860
 can rival some prescription antidepressants

1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:35.180
 and or decrease the amount of antidepressants

1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:36.180
 that's required to take,

1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:38.920
 which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.400
 because of the side effect profile

1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:41.540
 of many of those antidepressants.

1:27:41.540 --> 1:27:43.520
 Of course, talk to your psychiatrist, talk to your doctor,

1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:46.260
 but the omega-3s are no doubt powerful.

1:27:46.260 --> 1:27:47.460
 And then of course, there's a whole story

1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:49.500
 about omega-3s and heart health.

1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:51.100
 And of course, like anything else,

1:27:51.100 --> 1:27:52.760
 there's some controversy around omega-3s,

1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:54.580
 but I think the data are clear enough to me

1:27:54.580 --> 1:27:56.020
 around mood and cardiovascular health

1:27:56.020 --> 1:27:57.740
 that certainly I personally ingest them,

1:27:57.740 --> 1:27:59.780
 but as always, I always say,

1:27:59.780 --> 1:28:01.980
 anytime you're going to add or remove anything

1:28:01.980 --> 1:28:03.980
 from your nutrition, supplementation, exercise,

1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:06.280
 or otherwise your lifestyle,

1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.260
 definitely consult with a board certified physician.

1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:09.540
 I don't just say that to protect me.

1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:11.320
 I say that to protect you.

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.860
 You are responsible for your health ultimately.

1:28:13.860 --> 1:28:16.380
 So omega-3 supplementation has been shown

1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:18.380
 to be beneficial for ADHD.

1:28:18.380 --> 1:28:20.640
 Why am I talking about this in the context of an episode

1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:22.300
 on sugar and the nervous system?

1:28:22.300 --> 1:28:24.940
 Well, if you remember those neuropod cells,

1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:27.100
 those cells in your gut that respond to sugar

1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:28.620
 and send signals up to the brain

1:28:28.620 --> 1:28:30.380
 to cause the release of dopamine,

1:28:30.380 --> 1:28:32.500
 well, it turns out that neuropod cells

1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:37.380
 also respond to amino acids and to fatty acids,

1:28:37.380 --> 1:28:40.260
 in particular, essential fatty acids.

1:28:40.260 --> 1:28:45.260
 So the cells that we call neuropod cells have three jobs.

1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:47.940
 One is to detect levels of sugar in the gut.

1:28:47.940 --> 1:28:51.060
 The other is to detect levels of amino acids

1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:54.740
 and to detect levels of particular essential fatty acids

1:28:54.740 --> 1:28:58.340
 and communicate that information to the brain.

1:28:58.340 --> 1:28:59.180
 And I should point out,

1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:00.540
 when I say communicate that information,

1:29:00.540 --> 1:29:02.740
 they're not actually saying, hey, there's amino acids here,

1:29:02.740 --> 1:29:04.540
 or hey, there's sugar here,

1:29:04.540 --> 1:29:06.100
 or hey, there's essential fatty acids,

1:29:06.100 --> 1:29:09.140
 because the language of these cells is somewhat generic.

1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:11.700
 It's just the firing of electrical potentials.

1:29:11.700 --> 1:29:12.740
 But that's the key point.

1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:16.540
 It's generic and all three, or any of those three,

1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:19.460
 sugar essential fatty acids or amino acids

1:29:19.460 --> 1:29:22.360
 will trigger these neurons to signal to the brain

1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:23.220
 to increase dopamine.

1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:24.940
 And it is not coincidental

1:29:24.940 --> 1:29:27.460
 that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation

1:29:27.460 --> 1:29:30.420
 can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of ADHD

1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:34.940
 by way of presumably increasing dopamine

1:29:34.940 --> 1:29:37.140
 in this neuropod to dopamine pathway

1:29:37.140 --> 1:29:39.180
 that we talked about earlier.

1:29:39.180 --> 1:29:41.920
 The whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:43.860
 and points to, yet again,

1:29:43.860 --> 1:29:47.580
 the immense value of bringing the proper amounts,

1:29:47.580 --> 1:29:49.540
 maybe even supplementing the proper amounts

1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:50.820
 of omega-3 fatty acids

1:29:50.820 --> 1:29:53.980
 and the proper amounts of amino acids into the gut

1:29:53.980 --> 1:29:57.200
 as a way to supplant some of the stimulation

1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:00.100
 of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar.

1:30:01.420 --> 1:30:04.080
 There's actually a version of this where one could say,

1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:06.780
 if you want to reduce sugar cravings,

1:30:06.780 --> 1:30:10.580
 you might consider increasing certain forms

1:30:10.580 --> 1:30:13.780
 of amino acid intake or certain forms of fatty acid intake.

1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:14.620
 So what are some ways

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:17.180
 that we can reduce our sugar cravings?

1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:20.000
 And ideally, ways that we can do that

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.560
 that also benefit us in other ways,

1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:25.380
 both nutritionally and from the neuroscience standpoint?

1:30:25.380 --> 1:30:29.220
 Well, these neuropod cells that respond to

1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:32.720
 and signal the brain when we ingest sugar,

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.600
 as I mentioned, also respond to amino acids

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:36.220
 and essential fatty acids.

1:30:36.220 --> 1:30:38.740
 We already talked about the essential fatty acids.

1:30:38.740 --> 1:30:40.760
 I make it a particular point to ingest anywhere

1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:43.940
 from one to three grams, that's grams,

1:30:43.940 --> 1:30:47.180
 of EPA essential fatty acid per day.

1:30:47.180 --> 1:30:48.020
 I make it a point to do that

1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:51.060
 with the ingestion of high quality omega-3s.

1:30:51.060 --> 1:30:53.100
 For me, the simplest way to do that,

1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:54.900
 and I think for most people,

1:30:54.900 --> 1:30:56.420
 the lowest cost way to do that

1:30:56.420 --> 1:30:58.340
 is to use some liquid form of fish oil

1:30:58.340 --> 1:31:00.080
 or some capsule form of fish oil.

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:03.100
 You really do have to see how much essential fatty acid

1:31:03.100 --> 1:31:05.260
 in the form of EPA is in those.

1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:07.980
 If you try and do that only through capsules,

1:31:07.980 --> 1:31:09.100
 it can get kind of expensive,

1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:12.560
 depending on which particular brands you use.

1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:14.260
 Some have more EPA, some less.

1:31:14.260 --> 1:31:16.120
 You can, of course, also do this through foods.

1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:17.740
 You can do this with non-fish sources,

1:31:17.740 --> 1:31:20.180
 through things like algae, and there's some other forms.

1:31:20.180 --> 1:31:21.800
 You can look it up online now,

1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:24.140
 plant-based sources of EPAs.

1:31:24.140 --> 1:31:26.780
 You can do this with high quality fish oil.

1:31:26.780 --> 1:31:30.000
 In any case, that does seem,

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.820
 at least based on a modest amount,

1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:35.380
 but nonetheless solid literature,

1:31:35.380 --> 1:31:38.380
 to reduce sugar craving somewhat,

1:31:38.380 --> 1:31:41.940
 but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories.

1:31:41.940 --> 1:31:44.620
 So we don't know yet, based on human studies,

1:31:44.620 --> 1:31:46.460
 whether or not the ingestion of those EPAs

1:31:46.460 --> 1:31:48.840
 is specifically activating the neuropod cells,

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:51.620
 which specifically activates dopamine release

1:31:51.620 --> 1:31:55.140
 and bypasses the need for, or the craving for sugar.

1:31:55.140 --> 1:31:56.160
 We don't know that yet,

1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:00.580
 but logically it holds up to assume that.

1:32:00.580 --> 1:32:02.220
 The fact that these neuropod cells,

1:32:02.220 --> 1:32:04.660
 and I should say other neurons within the gut,

1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:07.920
 respond very robustly to the presence

1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:12.920
 of particular amino acids is also a potential lever

1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:14.760
 by which one could reduce sugar cravings.

1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:16.740
 And there's an interesting literature

1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:18.580
 around the amino acid glutamine,

1:32:18.580 --> 1:32:21.460
 in particular supplementing with the amino acid glutamine,

1:32:21.460 --> 1:32:23.780
 as it relates to sugar cravings,

1:32:23.780 --> 1:32:27.700
 and certainly as it relates to other aspects of the gut,

1:32:27.700 --> 1:32:29.560
 in particular leaky gut.

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:31.420
 The use of supplemental glutamine

1:32:31.420 --> 1:32:34.280
 to try and treat leaky gut is not a new phenomenon.

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:36.260
 There are other approaches too, of course,

1:32:36.260 --> 1:32:39.300
 but there are many people who are experimenting

1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:43.180
 with supplementing with glutamine several grams per day,

1:32:43.180 --> 1:32:46.060
 often even five grams distributed

1:32:46.060 --> 1:32:49.360
 through three or four different servings throughout the day

1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:51.580
 as a way to blunt their sugar cravings.

1:32:51.580 --> 1:32:55.900
 Now, there has not yet been a large-scale clinical trial

1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:57.760
 using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,

1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:01.300
 but the results of the few studies that I looked at,

1:33:01.300 --> 1:33:03.620
 as well as my understanding of the logic

1:33:03.620 --> 1:33:06.420
 of these neural circuits, including the neuropod cells,

1:33:06.420 --> 1:33:10.060
 brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense

1:33:10.060 --> 1:33:13.240
 why if there's a population of neurons within our gut

1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:15.940
 that responds very robustly to the presence of sugar,

1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:18.480
 fatty acids, or amino acids,

1:33:18.480 --> 1:33:21.160
 that the intake of particular amino acids

1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:23.700
 would allow the dopamine pathways

1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:26.300
 that might otherwise be triggered by sugar

1:33:26.300 --> 1:33:28.620
 to be triggered by something like glutamine,

1:33:28.620 --> 1:33:31.140
 which has very few or no calories.

1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:34.180
 And in fact, having talked about this previously,

1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:37.660
 a number of people that I know went out and tried this.

1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:40.320
 Now, this is, of course, is what I call anecdata, right?

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:43.540
 This is not a quality peer-reviewed study.

1:33:43.540 --> 1:33:45.700
 This is anecdata.

1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:48.740
 Many of them have reported back that they actually feel

1:33:48.740 --> 1:33:50.980
 as if their sugar cravings are reduced.

1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:53.060
 I know some people who actually take glutamine

1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:54.460
 and mix it with full fat cream

1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:56.020
 and take it kind of like a shot of full fat cream,

1:33:56.020 --> 1:33:57.620
 which sounds absolutely delicious, by the way.

1:33:57.620 --> 1:33:58.820
 Glutamine is a little bit chalky,

1:33:58.820 --> 1:34:01.960
 so it's not that great tasting to ingest with sugar.

1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:03.940
 I should mention, if you do try and take this approach

1:34:03.940 --> 1:34:06.780
 of ingesting glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,

1:34:06.780 --> 1:34:08.380
 you want to increase the amount of glutamine

1:34:08.380 --> 1:34:09.900
 that you take somewhat gradually.

1:34:09.900 --> 1:34:12.020
 It can create some gastric distress.

1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:12.860
 If you just, you know,

1:34:12.860 --> 1:34:14.460
 I certainly wouldn't take a big tablespoon of it,

1:34:14.460 --> 1:34:16.520
 throw it in water and chug it down three times a day.

1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:17.940
 Some of you with very hearty stomachs

1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:19.420
 can probably tolerate that.

1:34:19.420 --> 1:34:22.660
 You know, if you're like my, you know, my bulldog,

1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:24.420
 which unfortunately passed away, but Costello,

1:34:24.420 --> 1:34:26.460
 I always imagined that if ever we did an autopsy on him,

1:34:26.460 --> 1:34:27.660
 he'd have like a license plate

1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.460
 and like a human being in his gut,

1:34:29.460 --> 1:34:31.020
 because it seemed like he could ingest anything

1:34:31.020 --> 1:34:31.860
 with no issues.

1:34:31.860 --> 1:34:34.480
 But of course, many people have kind of sensitive guts.

1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:37.260
 So if you're going to try taking glutamine

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:38.980
 as a means to reduce sugar cravings,

1:34:38.980 --> 1:34:41.260
 just know that the studies are still ongoing.

1:34:41.260 --> 1:34:43.460
 Some people have achieved benefit.

1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:45.740
 Please also realize that there's an entire literature

1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:49.700
 devoted to the potential hazards of increasing glutamine

1:34:49.700 --> 1:34:52.400
 if you have a preexisting cancer.

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:54.600
 So if you have cancer or you're cancer prone,

1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:56.640
 I would really discourage you from this approach.

1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:59.800
 And in any case, as always, talk to your doctor.

1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:01.400
 The logic nonetheless is there,

1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:05.780
 why increasing amino acid intake or fatty acid intake

1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:08.700
 might decrease sugar craving.

1:35:08.700 --> 1:35:11.700
 Now, there are other ways to reduce sugar craving,

1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:15.300
 and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp rise

1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:17.380
 in blood glucose that can occur

1:35:17.380 --> 1:35:19.580
 when we ingest sugary sweet foods,

1:35:19.580 --> 1:35:22.460
 or even just an abundance of carbohydrate foods.

1:35:22.460 --> 1:35:24.540
 And there are a huge number of these things.

1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:27.040
 I'm going to sort of layer up through the ones

1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:29.000
 that you might find in your cupboard or at the grocery store

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.720
 and then get into some of the more extravagant,

1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:34.100
 or I should say esoteric ones.

1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:36.560
 Many of which, however, can be quite potent.

1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:40.940
 The first of which is simple lemon juice, right?

1:35:40.940 --> 1:35:42.360
 Or lime juice.

1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:45.500
 There was an old lore and actually some papers

1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:48.860
 pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar,

1:35:48.860 --> 1:35:51.900
 either white vinegar or wine vinegar

1:35:51.900 --> 1:35:54.620
 could somehow blunt blood glucose

1:35:54.620 --> 1:35:56.260
 after the ingestion of sugary foods

1:35:56.260 --> 1:35:58.420
 or the ingestion of a lot of carbohydrate foods

1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:00.220
 or even just a big meal.

1:36:00.220 --> 1:36:02.960
 Actually, Tim Ferriss, I should say the great Tim Ferriss,

1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:04.480
 because I do have great respect for the fact

1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:08.040
 that he seems to be about 10 years ahead of everything,

1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:10.140
 both in terms of nutrition and skill learning

1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:10.980
 and things of that sort.

1:36:10.980 --> 1:36:13.500
 Some of the things that he predicted in his books,

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:15.720
 the four hour body and the four hour chef

1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:19.260
 actually turned out to be true based on scientific data,

1:36:19.260 --> 1:36:21.220
 some of which only exists in the animal models,

1:36:21.220 --> 1:36:26.220
 but now also some predictions that played out to be true

1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:28.500
 in both the animal models and the human model.

1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:33.500
 So I think that Tim certainly deserves a hat tip

1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:36.140
 for the fact that he experimented with these methods

1:36:36.140 --> 1:36:39.280
 and reported his experiences with those methods

1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:41.140
 and that now some of them,

1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:42.560
 many of them have been validated

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:45.220
 by what I perceive to be quality science.

1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:47.020
 He talked about the fact that,

1:36:47.020 --> 1:36:49.620
 at least in his experiments on himself,

1:36:49.620 --> 1:36:54.040
 the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose

1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:56.100
 and he was using continuous glucose monitors.

1:36:56.100 --> 1:36:57.800
 These incidentally, another example

1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:00.400
 of where Ferriss was early to the game

1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:02.680
 and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake,

1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:05.740
 he talked about the use of blood glucose monitors.

1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:07.900
 Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin.

1:37:07.900 --> 1:37:11.060
 Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors,

1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:12.280
 things like levels and so forth,

1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:14.060
 and these are actually becoming pretty popular.

1:37:14.060 --> 1:37:15.200
 I've worn one of these before,

1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:17.380
 they're actually pretty informative.

1:37:17.380 --> 1:37:19.900
 I learned, for instance, that when I go in the sauna,

1:37:19.900 --> 1:37:23.320
 that I experienced a sharp rise in blood glucose

1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:26.260
 and that makes sense because of the dehydration

1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:27.940
 associated with being in the sauna,

1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:29.740
 a lot of sweating, the concentration of sugar

1:37:29.740 --> 1:37:31.380
 in the bloodstream goes up.

1:37:31.380 --> 1:37:33.080
 So there's some other things that certain foods

1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:34.660
 affect my blood glucose one way or another.

1:37:34.660 --> 1:37:36.920
 It's kind of an interesting and fun experiment

1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:39.840
 that some of you might be interested in doing as well.

1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:43.560
 Regardless, there are now data pointing to the fact

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:46.340
 that lemon juice and lime juice,

1:37:46.340 --> 1:37:48.460
 a couple of tablespoons or so,

1:37:48.460 --> 1:37:50.300
 if ingested before or even during

1:37:50.300 --> 1:37:53.300
 or even after consumption of sugary foods,

1:37:53.300 --> 1:37:57.080
 or I should say foods that sharply increase blood glucose

1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:58.620
 or large carbohydrate meals

1:37:58.620 --> 1:38:00.860
 can actually blunt the blood glucose response.

1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:04.240
 And I did see that when I did my own experiments on myself

1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:07.100
 with continuous glucose monitor, it was kind of fun

1:38:07.100 --> 1:38:09.620
 to do those experiments.

1:38:09.620 --> 1:38:11.020
 I preferred to do those experiments

1:38:11.020 --> 1:38:13.220
 by eating somewhat larger meals of things

1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:14.740
 that didn't contain a lot of sugar.

1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:16.580
 I saw some big increases in blood glucose

1:38:16.580 --> 1:38:17.460
 in certain instances.

1:38:17.460 --> 1:38:20.220
 And then I would ingest some lemon juice or lime juice,

1:38:20.220 --> 1:38:21.700
 typically mixed in with water.

1:38:21.700 --> 1:38:23.380
 And sure enough, you could see a blunting

1:38:23.380 --> 1:38:24.620
 of the blood glucose response.

1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:27.780
 And of course, this was real time blood continuous,

1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:30.940
 hence continuous blood glucose monitoring.

1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:32.960
 So for those of you that are interested

1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:37.220
 in blunting your blood sugar response, certain foods,

1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:39.300
 that's a simple low cost way to do that

1:38:39.300 --> 1:38:40.140
 if you want to explore it.

1:38:40.140 --> 1:38:42.980
 I will say if you are fasting

1:38:42.980 --> 1:38:45.140
 and you already have low blood glucose

1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:47.740
 and you ingest lemon juice,

1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:49.500
 or I should say it's some lemon juice and water

1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:51.260
 or lime juice and water,

1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:54.680
 be careful because you can actually become hypoglycemic,

1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:58.260
 for the very same reasons that lemon juice and lime juice

1:38:58.260 --> 1:38:59.620
 can blunt blood glucose

1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:02.480
 when your blood glucose levels are moderate to high.

1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:04.980
 You can also reduce blood glucose levels even further

1:39:04.980 --> 1:39:06.700
 when blood glucose levels are low.

1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:10.140
 Now that's lemon juice and lime juice there,

1:39:10.140 --> 1:39:14.180
 but we can't say that has to do with acidic things generally

1:39:14.180 --> 1:39:16.100
 and just as a side point,

1:39:16.100 --> 1:39:17.940
 many of you have probably seen in the store,

1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:21.380
 so-called adjusted pH waters or foods and drinks

1:39:21.380 --> 1:39:22.980
 that are supposed to adjust your pH.

1:39:22.980 --> 1:39:23.900
 Hate to break it to you,

1:39:23.900 --> 1:39:26.440
 but your pH is very tightly regulated

1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:27.900
 throughout your brain and body.

1:39:27.900 --> 1:39:29.660
 You do not want this to change.

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:32.180
 It is entirely impossible,

1:39:32.180 --> 1:39:33.760
 at least in any safe way,

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:35.940
 that you would become quote unquote more alkaline

1:39:35.940 --> 1:39:38.380
 by ingesting an alkaline water or something like that.

1:39:38.380 --> 1:39:42.140
 It is true that your pH, your alkalinity and acidity

1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:43.860
 varies in different compartments in your body.

1:39:43.860 --> 1:39:45.220
 That's important.

1:39:45.220 --> 1:39:48.180
 Unless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting

1:39:48.180 --> 1:39:50.660
 or there's something badly wrong with you health-wise

1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:52.740
 and you're in a really dire circumstance,

1:39:52.740 --> 1:39:54.780
 you don't want big shifts in your body pH

1:39:54.780 --> 1:39:56.220
 and your body has all sorts of ways

1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:59.340
 of buffering against changes in pH.

1:39:59.340 --> 1:40:02.380
 So I encourage you not to fall on the,

1:40:02.380 --> 1:40:05.060
 or hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH

1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:06.680
 and becoming less acidic and that kind of thing.

1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:08.740
 When you ingest lemon juice or lime juice,

1:40:08.740 --> 1:40:11.500
 the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucose

1:40:11.500 --> 1:40:13.380
 is probably twofold.

1:40:13.380 --> 1:40:17.140
 One is probably through the post-ingestive effects

1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:18.540
 of glucose in the gut,

1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:22.800
 meaning the way in which sugars are interacting

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:26.300
 with neurons and other components of your gut circuitry

1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:30.440
 to impact things like gastric emptying time,

1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:34.100
 to impact things like the firing of those neuropod cells

1:40:34.100 --> 1:40:35.800
 and their signaling to the brain.

1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:39.620
 But almost certainly it has something to do

1:40:39.620 --> 1:40:43.240
 also with the perception of sour taste on the tongue.

1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:45.260
 We didn't go into this too much today,

1:40:45.260 --> 1:40:49.380
 but you of course don't just have sweet taste receptors

1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:51.220
 in your mouth, you also have bitter taste receptors,

1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:53.060
 you have salty taste receptors,

1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:55.300
 you have sour taste receptors in your mouth

1:40:55.300 --> 1:40:56.740
 and on your, and of course,

1:40:56.740 --> 1:40:58.480
 that means your tongue and palate,

1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:00.340
 and those are interacting.

1:41:00.340 --> 1:41:03.500
 If you ingest a substance that's just sweet

1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:07.920
 or mostly sweet, that causes a certain set of effects

1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:09.980
 on your blood glucose, but also your brain,

1:41:09.980 --> 1:41:12.620
 dopamine and the other neural circuits of your brain.

1:41:12.620 --> 1:41:15.740
 If you also ingest something that's sour,

1:41:15.740 --> 1:41:17.820
 like lemon juice or lime juice,

1:41:17.820 --> 1:41:20.900
 it adjusts the output of those neural circuits

1:41:20.900 --> 1:41:21.820
 in your brain.

1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:23.580
 So again, we have a situation,

1:41:23.580 --> 1:41:25.220
 we have two parallel pathways.

1:41:25.220 --> 1:41:27.800
 One that's post-ingestive coming from phenomenon

1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:29.980
 within our gut, neurons,

1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:31.620
 but also things like gastric emptying time,

1:41:31.620 --> 1:41:35.380
 the clearance and the transfer of food

1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:38.420
 and the conversion of food into particular nutrients

1:41:38.420 --> 1:41:41.340
 and the circulation of glucose in your bloodstream

1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:42.660
 and how it gets into the brain,

1:41:42.660 --> 1:41:45.940
 but also simply by ingesting something sour,

1:41:45.940 --> 1:41:49.060
 you are changing the way that sweet things

1:41:49.060 --> 1:41:50.260
 impact your brain.

1:41:50.260 --> 1:41:54.240
 And so I think it stands to reason that the lemon juice,

1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:57.060
 lime juice effect is not going to be magic.

1:41:57.060 --> 1:41:58.760
 It's going to have everything to do with the way

1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:02.500
 that ingesting sour foods can adjust the taste,

1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:05.580
 excuse me, can adjust the neural response

1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:06.980
 to taste of sweet foods.

1:42:06.980 --> 1:42:09.320
 And in fact, we know based on the beautiful work

1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:13.100
 of Charles Zucker at Columbia Medical School,

1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:14.840
 that that's exactly what happens.

1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:17.120
 They've measured the activity of neurons

1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:19.620
 at various locations in the so-called taste pathways

1:42:19.620 --> 1:42:20.460
 of the brain.

1:42:20.460 --> 1:42:23.420
 And they found that when particular tastes

1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:25.820
 like just sweet or just bitter or just sour

1:42:25.820 --> 1:42:28.660
 evoke certain ensembles of neurons to fire

1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:30.300
 in particular sequences,

1:42:30.300 --> 1:42:32.800
 when sweet and sour are co-ingested,

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:35.500
 when bitter and sour are co-ingested,

1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:37.500
 you get distinct ensembles,

1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:39.980
 meaning distinct patterns of activity of those neurons

1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:43.220
 and of course, distinct patterns of downstream activity

1:42:43.220 --> 1:42:44.380
 within the brain and body.

1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:47.440
 So while it is still somewhat mysterious

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:50.640
 as to how exactly things like lemon juice and lime juice

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:53.700
 can reduce our blood glucose spikes

1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:56.480
 when we ingest those with sweet foods

1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:59.700
 or carbohydrate-laden foods or with big meals,

1:42:59.700 --> 1:43:01.640
 you can use this as a tool with the understanding

1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:03.620
 that there's a grounding in the biology

1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:05.100
 of the way these circuits work.

1:43:05.100 --> 1:43:07.180
 Now, some of you have probably heard that cinnamon

1:43:07.180 --> 1:43:09.340
 can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar.

1:43:09.340 --> 1:43:10.900
 And indeed that's the case.

1:43:10.900 --> 1:43:14.080
 It's very clear that cinnamon can adjust the rate

1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:16.460
 of glucose entry into the bloodstream,

1:43:16.460 --> 1:43:19.880
 possibly by changing the rate of gastric emptying.

1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:22.860
 It might slow the rate of gastric emptying

1:43:22.860 --> 1:43:26.220
 and thereby also reduce the glycemic index

1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:27.220
 of particular foods.

1:43:27.220 --> 1:43:29.700
 So I suppose if I were going to eat a mango

1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:31.620
 and I hadn't just done a bunch of hard training,

1:43:31.620 --> 1:43:33.580
 I might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here.

1:43:33.580 --> 1:43:35.380
 I always enjoy kind of coming up with new ideas

1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:38.180
 of ways that I can eat foods during these podcasts.

1:43:38.180 --> 1:43:39.940
 In any event, there's some debate out there.

1:43:39.940 --> 1:43:41.260
 If you look online as to whether or not

1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:43.460
 Saigon cinnamon, Cassia cinnamon,

1:43:43.460 --> 1:43:46.060
 excuse me, or Ceylon cinnamon is best

1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:49.620
 for purposes of blunting blood glucose spikes.

1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:54.340
 But I think the, at least by my read of the data

1:43:54.340 --> 1:43:56.340
 and from what I found, it doesn't really matter

1:43:56.340 --> 1:43:57.780
 provided it's real cinnamon.

1:43:57.780 --> 1:43:59.620
 And you have to actually look and make sure

1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:01.780
 that it's real cinnamon because a lot of cinnamon

1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:03.340
 that you buy is not real.

1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:05.220
 I do want to provide a cautionary note

1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:06.580
 about cinnamon however.

1:44:06.580 --> 1:44:09.220
 Cinnamon contains something called Coumadin,

1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:12.220
 which can be toxic at high levels.

1:44:12.220 --> 1:44:15.620
 So you don't want to ingest more than about a teaspoon,

1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:18.820
 maybe a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon per day

1:44:18.820 --> 1:44:20.460
 because you'll start to exceed the threshold

1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:23.340
 at which cinnamon could start to be problematic.

1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:26.540
 But certainly if you're going to have a big meal

1:44:26.540 --> 1:44:29.100
 or a meal that has a lot of sugar in it

1:44:29.100 --> 1:44:31.580
 or a lot of carbohydrate laden foods

1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:34.060
 and you don't want an increase in blood glucose,

1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:36.920
 you could put cinnamon in a beverage,

1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:38.220
 you could put cinnamon on food

1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:41.540
 in order to blunt that blood glucose increase,

1:44:41.540 --> 1:44:42.780
 reduce the glycemic index

1:44:42.780 --> 1:44:44.660
 by way of reducing gastric emptying time.

1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:47.120
 Again, just making sure that you don't get out past

1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:48.980
 that one and a half teaspoons per day

1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:51.380
 because you really don't want to start dealing

1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:53.300
 with any of the toxicity related to Coumadin.

1:44:53.300 --> 1:44:55.540
 So we've talked about lemon juice and lime juice

1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:57.140
 and cinnamon, these are kind of commonplace

1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:58.160
 in many kitchens.

1:44:59.620 --> 1:45:03.040
 Then of course we can venture into the more esoteric

1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:04.840
 or I would say the more advanced tools

1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:07.680
 for adjusting sugar intake.

1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:11.900
 And the one that comes to mind is of course berberine.

1:45:11.900 --> 1:45:14.580
 Berberine is a derivative of tree bark

1:45:14.580 --> 1:45:17.140
 and is a very, very potent substance

1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:18.300
 for reducing blood glucose.

1:45:18.300 --> 1:45:22.460
 So much so that is on par with metformin or glibenclamide

1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:25.400
 which are prescription drugs specifically used

1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:27.380
 to reduce blood glucose.

1:45:27.380 --> 1:45:30.580
 So using berberine is a serious step,

1:45:30.580 --> 1:45:32.960
 you should absolutely talk to your doctor about it.

1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:34.300
 I know of a number of people that use it

1:45:34.300 --> 1:45:37.700
 to lower blood glucose when they eat really large meals.

1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:39.620
 I know the number of people that are using it

1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:43.540
 to get to some of the other effects of metformin

1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:46.840
 that people have discussed, things like activating

1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:50.280
 or tapping into the so-called AMPK pathway, reducing mTOR.

1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:54.020
 These are people that are aiming their activities

1:45:54.020 --> 1:45:55.940
 at increasing longevity,

1:45:55.940 --> 1:45:58.020
 a somewhat controversial approach still

1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:00.660
 but I know many people are doing it.

1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:03.100
 It is true that if you ingest berberine

1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:05.420
 your blood glucose will plummet.

1:46:05.420 --> 1:46:08.060
 And I point that out because I've actually tried it before,

1:46:08.060 --> 1:46:11.660
 it gave me brutal headaches and I felt really dizzy

1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:13.740
 and I felt like I couldn't see straight

1:46:13.740 --> 1:46:15.620
 and actually I couldn't see straight.

1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:16.460
 Why did it do that?

1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:18.540
 Well, it made me hypoglycemic,

1:46:18.540 --> 1:46:21.800
 it actually drove my blood glucose down too far.

1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:24.280
 And the reason it did that is that I took berberine

1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:27.480
 on an empty stomach, I know some people can tolerate it.

1:46:28.380 --> 1:46:30.940
 I would say be very cautious about ingesting berberine

1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:34.160
 on an empty stomach or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet

1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:35.620
 unless you really know what you're doing

1:46:35.620 --> 1:46:36.940
 and you have a medical professional

1:46:36.940 --> 1:46:38.640
 to kind of guide you through that.

1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:43.620
 If I took berberine along with a very large meal

1:46:43.620 --> 1:46:45.720
 that include a lot of carbohydrates,

1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:47.680
 I can recall the days in which Costello and I

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:49.820
 would eat a couple of pizzas

1:46:49.820 --> 1:46:51.900
 and then we might get ice cream, that kind of thing.

1:46:51.900 --> 1:46:55.740
 Then I felt perfectly fine on even up to 750 milligrams

1:46:55.740 --> 1:46:57.380
 or a gram of berberine.

1:46:57.380 --> 1:46:59.260
 It has a kind of unique property

1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:02.160
 of making you feel not overwhelmed

1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:04.520
 by the amount of blood glucose increase

1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:06.340
 that you're experiencing from eating a big meal.

1:47:06.340 --> 1:47:08.520
 I don't quite know how else to describe it.

1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:10.160
 It's almost as if you can keep eating

1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:11.000
 and eating and eating.

1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:12.920
 And of course you have to protect

1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:15.600
 your gastric volume, right?

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:16.880
 I mean, you only have so much space

1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:19.080
 in your stomach to ingest food.

1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:20.820
 I wasn't using it to gorge on food.

1:47:20.820 --> 1:47:21.680
 I just heard about it.

1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:23.080
 I was interested in experimenting with it.

1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:25.720
 I don't have any chronic blood sugar issues,

1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:27.560
 but again, when I took it on an empty stomach,

1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:31.400
 it made me hypoglycemic on a low carbohydrate intake,

1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:34.480
 hypoglycemic, not a good experience.

1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:37.800
 And again, an experience I think to avoid,

1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:40.480
 but provided there's a lot of glucose in your bloodstream.

1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.020
 And certainly if you are of the experimental type

1:47:44.020 --> 1:47:45.800
 or you're trying to regulate blood glucose,

1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:47.500
 berberine might be a good option.

1:47:47.500 --> 1:47:49.520
 But again, talk to your doctor.

1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:51.240
 It does have some other interesting effects

1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:53.560
 in terms of lowering total cholesterol

1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:55.600
 that are research supported

1:47:55.600 --> 1:47:58.440
 of reducing insulin a little bit.

1:47:58.440 --> 1:47:59.400
 Well, that's not surprising.

1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:00.440
 If you reduce blood glucose,

1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:01.640
 you're going to reduce insulin

1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:04.040
 because of course insulin manages blood glucose

1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:05.440
 in the bloodstream.

1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:07.080
 So I would place berberine

1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:09.260
 and of course metformin and glibenclamide

1:48:09.260 --> 1:48:12.540
 in the kind of the heavy hitting potent tools

1:48:12.540 --> 1:48:14.920
 for regulating blood glucose.

1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:17.800
 Now, this is an episode not about sugar per se,

1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:20.640
 but sugar viewed through the lens of the nervous system.

1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:22.040
 And what's interesting about berberine,

1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:25.320
 metformin, glibenclamide and related substances

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:28.780
 is that some of the effects are of course

1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:31.080
 on gastric emptying or buffering blood glucose

1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:33.840
 within the bloodstream, et cetera.

1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.280
 But there appear to also be some neural effects

1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:40.840
 of having chronically low glucose

1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:44.520
 or blunting blood glucose through things like berberine.

1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:45.880
 And some of those neural effects

1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:50.880
 include longstanding changes in the hormonal cascades

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.360
 that are the consequence of having low blood sugar

1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:56.720
 and thereby changes in the neural circuits

1:48:56.720 --> 1:48:58.860
 that manage blood glucose overall.

1:48:58.860 --> 1:49:00.240
 The simple way of saying this

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:03.800
 is that by maintaining low to moderate blood glucose,

1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:07.520
 either by not ingesting heavily carbohydrate-laden foods,

1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:09.160
 so here I'm speaking to the low carb

1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:10.720
 and to the ketogenic types,

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.880
 or by blunting blood glucose

1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:15.600
 through things like metformin or berberine,

1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:18.440
 even if ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even some sugars.

1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:21.660
 Over time, it seems that there's a adjustment,

1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:24.920
 what we call a homeostatic regulation of the neural circuits

1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:26.680
 that control things like sugar craving.

1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:28.740
 And indeed, some people report

1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:31.680
 feeling fewer sugar cravings over time.

1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:34.900
 Now, I didn't use berberine for a very long period of time.

1:49:34.900 --> 1:49:36.520
 I've never used metformin.

1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:40.120
 I have experienced a somewhat odd but welcome phenomenon

1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:42.880
 of with each progressive year of my life,

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:45.720
 I have fewer and fewer sugar cravings.

1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:46.960
 Why that is, I don't know.

1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:49.400
 I suspect it might have something to do with my sleep,

1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:51.240
 and I'll talk about that in a few minutes.

1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:53.080
 But if you're going to explore berberine

1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:54.120
 or metformin or otherwise,

1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:56.040
 in addition to working with a doctor,

1:49:56.040 --> 1:49:58.680
 I think you should understand why you're doing it, right?

1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:01.760
 I think that many of the effects can be quite potent.

1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:04.100
 They can happen in both the immediate term,

1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:05.820
 in terms of regulating blood glucose.

1:50:05.820 --> 1:50:09.240
 They can send you hypoglycemic if you aren't careful.

1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:12.300
 They can also cause longstanding changes

1:50:12.300 --> 1:50:15.000
 to the neural circuitry that regulates blood sugar over time,

1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:16.920
 some of which might be welcome changes, right?

1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:19.000
 Reduce sugar cravings, for instance.

1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.660
 And if you're really, really serious

1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:25.360
 about modulating blood glucose through things like berberine,

1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:26.840
 the typical dose range, again,

1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:30.520
 is anywhere from half a gram to 1.5 grams daily.

1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:33.200
 That's the typical dosages that have been explored.

1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:37.560
 And there are some other substances like sodium cuprate,

1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:40.120
 which are known to augment the effects of berberine

1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.200
 via the AMPK pathways.

1:50:42.200 --> 1:50:45.160
 They basically can increase the ability for berberine

1:50:45.160 --> 1:50:47.320
 to have its glucose-lowering actions.

1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:49.800
 But that, of course, is getting into the really potent,

1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:51.600
 what I would call sharp blade tools

1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:53.560
 for controlling blood glucose.

1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:56.820
 And listen, anytime you're dealing with blood glucose,

1:50:56.820 --> 1:51:00.100
 you are dealing with the brain's preferred source of fuel.

1:51:00.100 --> 1:51:00.940
 And anytime you're dealing

1:51:00.940 --> 1:51:03.280
 with the brain's preferred source of fuel,

1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:04.760
 you have to be especially cautious

1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:07.000
 about depriving the brain of what it needs.

1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.160
 So whether or not you're low carb, high carb,

1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:12.400
 keto, vegan, carnivore,

1:51:12.400 --> 1:51:15.020
 these substances like berberine are very, very potent,

1:51:15.020 --> 1:51:16.680
 and you need to take them seriously.

1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:19.960
 There is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings

1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:23.720
 and the neural circuits that regulate sugar craving

1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:26.280
 and its downstream consequences.

1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:30.220
 And this tool is what I would call a high-performance tool,

1:51:30.220 --> 1:51:33.840
 but it's one that you probably didn't suspect,

1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:35.980
 and that's sleep.

1:51:35.980 --> 1:51:38.680
 I've done extensive episodes about sleep,

1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:42.000
 and we actually have an episode called Master Your Sleep.

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.440
 You can find that episode easily at HubermanLab.com.

1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:46.000
 It's available in all the various formats,

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:47.880
 YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera,

1:51:47.880 --> 1:51:49.660
 and provides a lot of tools.

1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:51.620
 And on social media, I provide a lot of tools.

1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:53.360
 Often we have a newsletter that provides tools

1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:54.740
 on how to maximize sleep.

1:51:54.740 --> 1:51:59.740
 What is the role of sleep in sugar metabolism,

1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:03.360
 sugar hunger, and the way that the brain

1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:04.620
 regulates those things?

1:52:04.620 --> 1:52:08.200
 Well, there's a really exciting study that came out

1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:09.940
 just last year.

1:52:09.940 --> 1:52:11.940
 This study was published in the journal Cell Report,

1:52:11.940 --> 1:52:14.080
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:16.080
 And the reason I love this study so much

1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:17.440
 is it involved having people,

1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:19.180
 so yes, this was done in humans,

1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:20.520
 sleep in the laboratory.

1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:21.560
 That's not unusual.

1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:22.740
 There's a sleep lab at Stanford.

1:52:22.740 --> 1:52:24.380
 There's sleep labs elsewhere.

1:52:24.380 --> 1:52:27.740
 But what they did was they actually measured

1:52:27.740 --> 1:52:30.220
 from the breath of these people

1:52:30.220 --> 1:52:32.180
 and they extracted from their breath

1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:36.760
 the metabolites that would allow them to understand

1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:38.980
 what sorts of metabolism was occurring

1:52:38.980 --> 1:52:42.140
 in these people's bodies at different phases of sleep.

1:52:42.140 --> 1:52:44.140
 And this is a really remarkable study.

1:52:44.140 --> 1:52:47.660
 They actually did this every 10 seconds

1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:48.760
 throughout the entire night.

1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:50.820
 So in little tiny 10 sec bins,

1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:52.420
 meaning at very high resolution,

1:52:52.420 --> 1:52:54.640
 they could evaluate what is the metabolism in the brain

1:52:54.640 --> 1:52:57.660
 and body that people experience as they go from REM sleep,

1:52:57.660 --> 1:53:00.740
 rapid eye movement sleep, to slow wave sleep, and so on.

1:53:00.740 --> 1:53:03.500
 And I'll go deeper into the study again in the future

1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:05.760
 because it's so interesting and I think so important.

1:53:05.760 --> 1:53:09.380
 But what they discovered was that each stage of sleep

1:53:09.380 --> 1:53:12.380
 was associated with a very particular signature pattern

1:53:12.380 --> 1:53:16.100
 of metabolism and particular phases of sleep

1:53:16.100 --> 1:53:18.580
 are associated with sugar metabolism

1:53:18.580 --> 1:53:20.460
 or more with fat metabolism

1:53:20.460 --> 1:53:23.180
 or more with other aspects of metabolism.

1:53:23.180 --> 1:53:26.180
 And the reason why I think this study is important

1:53:26.180 --> 1:53:28.580
 to discuss in the context of today's discussion

1:53:28.580 --> 1:53:31.980
 about sugar in the brain is that many people

1:53:31.980 --> 1:53:36.000
 have experienced the effects of disrupted sleep

1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:36.940
 on their appetite.

1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:38.980
 And in particular, it's been reported

1:53:38.980 --> 1:53:40.780
 that when people are sleep deprived

1:53:40.780 --> 1:53:43.660
 or the quality of their sleep is disrupted,

1:53:43.660 --> 1:53:46.740
 that their appetite for sugary foods increases.

1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:49.300
 Now that was always assumed to be

1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:52.260
 due to some metabolic need

1:53:52.260 --> 1:53:54.060
 that was triggered by the sleep deprivation

1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:55.540
 or by the poor sleep.

1:53:55.540 --> 1:53:56.740
 But in reading over this study,

1:53:56.740 --> 1:53:59.080
 some of the more important points made by the authors

1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:00.660
 relate to the fact that, well,

1:54:00.660 --> 1:54:03.540
 sleep is known to have incredibly important effects

1:54:03.540 --> 1:54:05.900
 on brain and body for a variety of systems,

1:54:05.900 --> 1:54:08.840
 immune system, neural functioning, et cetera.

1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:11.660
 This very organized sequence

1:54:11.660 --> 1:54:14.140
 of particular forms of metabolism

1:54:14.140 --> 1:54:16.540
 being active during particular phases of sleep,

1:54:16.540 --> 1:54:18.900
 which are very, very well orchestrated as we know,

1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:21.620
 slow wave sleep and REM sleep being orchestrated

1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:23.580
 in 90 minutes, so-called ultradian cycles

1:54:23.580 --> 1:54:24.740
 and so on and so forth,

1:54:25.860 --> 1:54:29.180
 is thought to perhaps set up the brain and body

1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:32.360
 to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours.

1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:35.100
 And therefore, when people are sleep deprived

1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:38.760
 or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep,

1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:42.020
 such as rapid eye movement sleep,

1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:43.900
 that it creates a disruption

1:54:43.900 --> 1:54:46.620
 in a particular set of metabolic pathways.

1:54:46.620 --> 1:54:48.740
 Now, we don't want to leap too far from this study

1:54:48.740 --> 1:54:50.600
 to sugar metabolism and the neural circuits

1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:52.260
 controlling sugar metabolism.

1:54:52.260 --> 1:54:53.660
 But I will say this,

1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:58.920
 if you look at the sum total of the data on obesity

1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:00.660
 or on type two diabetes

1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:02.860
 or on metabolic syndromes of any kind,

1:55:02.860 --> 1:55:06.500
 you almost always see disruptions in sleep.

1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:09.220
 Now, some of those could be due to sleep apnea

1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:11.960
 caused by even just the size of somebody's neck

1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:13.400
 or the weight of their body.

1:55:14.860 --> 1:55:17.260
 In other words, we don't know the direction of the effect.

1:55:17.260 --> 1:55:19.020
 Metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep,

1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:20.780
 which disrupt metabolic syndromes.

1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:23.860
 And indeed, the authors point out quite appropriately

1:55:23.860 --> 1:55:26.420
 that they don't understand the direction of the effects

1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:28.180
 that they observe either.

1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:32.340
 But there is now a plethora of data pointing to the fact

1:55:32.340 --> 1:55:34.520
 that getting quality sleep each night

1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:37.300
 helps regulate not only appetite,

1:55:37.300 --> 1:55:39.740
 but also the specific forms of metabolism

1:55:39.740 --> 1:55:42.180
 that drive specific appetites.

1:55:42.180 --> 1:55:44.340
 So the takeaway is,

1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:47.660
 while there are extravagant and potent

1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:50.940
 and interesting ways to regulate blood glucose,

1:55:50.940 --> 1:55:53.140
 everything from cinnamon to lemon juice to berberine

1:55:53.140 --> 1:55:56.140
 to sodium caprate to behavioral tools

1:55:56.140 --> 1:55:58.660
 to the mere understanding of how the direct

1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:02.000
 and indirect pathways go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera.

1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:06.340
 If you're not establishing the firm foundation

1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:07.740
 of proper metabolism,

1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:11.060
 all of those things are going to be

1:56:11.060 --> 1:56:13.700
 sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic

1:56:13.700 --> 1:56:15.860
 as sometimes described.

1:56:15.860 --> 1:56:19.140
 So we can't overstate the importance of getting regular,

1:56:19.140 --> 1:56:21.260
 sufficient amount of high quality sleep

1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:22.620
 at least 80% of the time,

1:56:22.620 --> 1:56:24.940
 not just for sake of immune system function,

1:56:24.940 --> 1:56:26.220
 for clear thinking, et cetera,

1:56:26.220 --> 1:56:30.160
 but also for properly regulating our metabolism,

1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:32.060
 including our sugar metabolism.

1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:33.540
 Thank you for joining me for this discussion

1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:34.900
 about sugar and the nervous system

1:56:34.900 --> 1:56:36.700
 and how they are regulating each other

1:56:36.700 --> 1:56:38.900
 in both the brain and body.

 on Instagram or Twitter, please do so.

1:57:17.300 --> 1:57:20.040
 There I cover science and science-based tools

1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:22.660
 that sometimes overlap with the content of the podcast,

1:57:22.660 --> 1:57:25.700
 but often is distinct from the content of the podcast.

1:57:25.700 --> 1:57:28.040
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:30.820
 of the Huberman Lab podcast, I discussed supplements.

1:57:30.820 --> 1:57:33.040
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:35.320
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:37.140
 One issue with supplements is that

1:57:37.140 --> 1:57:38.260
 if you're going to take them,

1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:39.300
 you want to make sure that they have

1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:41.020
 the absolute highest quality.

1:57:41.020 --> 1:57:44.980
 For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E

1:57:44.980 --> 1:57:47.100
 because Thorne is partnered, for instance,

1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:50.340
 with all the major sports teams and the Mayo Clinic.

1:57:50.340 --> 1:57:51.920
 There's tremendous trust in the fact

1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:54.640
 that Thorne supplements contain the specific amounts

1:57:54.640 --> 1:57:56.120
 of supplements that are listed on the bottle

1:57:56.120 --> 1:57:58.360
 and that the quality of the ingredients they include

1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:01.320
 are of the very highest standards.

1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:02.840
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:07.060
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

1:58:07.060 --> 1:58:10.240
 and you can get 20% off any of the supplements listed there.

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:12.560
 Also, if you navigate further into the Thorne site

1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:15.700
 through that portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:18.300
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:58:18.300 --> 1:58:19.240
 that Thorne makes.

1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:20.560
 Also, if you haven't yet signed up

1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:23.560
 for the Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter,

1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:27.120
 it's a semi-monthly newsletter that includes summaries

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:30.080
 of various podcasts, it has some actionable protocols,

1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:33.160
 it's completely cost-free, you simply provide your email.

1:58:33.160 --> 1:58:36.060

 we do not share your email.

1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:38.540
 If you want to get the newsletter,

1:58:38.540 --> 1:58:41.160
 you can go to HubermanLab.com, just go to the menu,
