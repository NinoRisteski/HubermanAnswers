00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.040
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.040 --> 00:12.960
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.960 --> 00:14.960
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.440
 Today, we are discussing aggression.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.520
 I'm going to explain to you

00:18.520 --> 00:20.780
 that there are several different types of aggression.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.360
 For instance, reactive aggression

00:22.360 --> 00:23.720
 versus proactive aggression,

00:23.720 --> 00:26.440
 meaning sometimes people will be aggressive

00:26.440 --> 00:29.840
 because they feel threatened or they are protecting those

00:29.840 --> 00:32.440
 that they love who also feel threatened.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.960
 There's also proactive aggression

00:33.960 --> 00:35.520
 where people go out of their way

00:35.520 --> 00:37.920
 to deliberately try and harm others.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.240
 And there is indirect aggression,

00:40.240 --> 00:43.320
 which is aggression not involving physical violence,

00:43.320 --> 00:46.760
 for instance, shaming people and things of that sort.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.240
 It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms

00:49.240 --> 00:51.860
 underlying each of the different types of aggression.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.980
 And today I will define those for you.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.880
 I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body

00:55.880 --> 00:58.680
 that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression,

00:58.680 --> 01:00.760
 talk about some of the hormones and peptides

01:00.760 --> 01:02.480
 and neurotransmitters involved.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.540
 I promise to make it all accessible to you,

01:04.540 --> 01:07.960
 even if you do not have any biology or science background.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.920
 I will also discuss tools,

01:09.920 --> 01:12.920
 psychological tools and biological tools

01:12.920 --> 01:16.360
 that one can use to better control aggression.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.440
 Now, right here at the outset,

01:17.440 --> 01:20.640
 I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression

01:20.640 --> 01:23.600
 has to have an element of context within it.

01:24.460 --> 01:28.120
 To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money,

01:28.120 --> 01:30.400
 a lot of time and a lot of energy,

01:30.400 --> 01:33.880
 and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.860
 Later, I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body

01:36.860 --> 01:38.440
 that reinforce, in other words,

01:38.440 --> 01:41.760
 reward through the release of chemicals

01:41.760 --> 01:45.000
 that make people feel good, acts of aggression.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.080
 However, what I'm mainly referring to

01:47.080 --> 01:50.740
 is the context in which human beings will pay money

01:50.740 --> 01:54.000
 in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.400
 To put it simply, people spend an enormous amount of money

01:58.400 --> 02:01.240
 and time and energy watching other people engage in,

02:01.240 --> 02:02.880
 for instance, aggressive sports.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.460
 And we know that observing your team winning

02:05.460 --> 02:08.440
 over another team causes the release of neurochemicals

02:08.440 --> 02:10.200
 in your brain and body that make you feel good,

02:10.200 --> 02:13.940
 and yes, that can make you feel more aggressive.

02:13.940 --> 02:16.000
 We also know, of course,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.080
 that most governments invest many billions,

02:19.080 --> 02:22.600
 if not trillions of dollars in infrastructure technologies

02:22.600 --> 02:26.320
 and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed,

02:26.320 --> 02:29.180
 so-called military warfare, et cetera.

02:29.180 --> 02:32.600
 So today's discussion will include a description of aggression

02:32.600 --> 02:34.300
 in the pathological sense.

02:34.300 --> 02:38.220
 We'll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder

02:38.220 --> 02:39.820
 that most of you probably haven't heard of,

02:39.820 --> 02:43.280
 but is actually far more common than perhaps you know.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.000
 We'll talk about the role of things

02:45.000 --> 02:47.200
 like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

02:47.200 --> 02:49.520
 and how that can relate to aggression

02:49.520 --> 02:52.000
 through the relationship between impulsivity

02:52.000 --> 02:52.840
 and aggression.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.360
 And we'll talk about verbal aggression,

02:54.360 --> 02:56.800
 physical aggression, proactive aggression

02:56.800 --> 02:59.480
 as mentioned before, and reactive aggression.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.960
 I'm certain that by the end of the episode,

03:00.960 --> 03:03.760
 you will come away with a much more thorough understanding

03:03.760 --> 03:06.720
 of what this thing that we call aggression really is.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.900
 And when you see it in other people,

03:08.900 --> 03:10.760
 I think it will make more sense to you.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.080
 And when you observe it in yourself

03:13.080 --> 03:15.280
 or the impulse to engage in aggression,

03:15.280 --> 03:17.640
 verbal or physical or otherwise,

03:17.640 --> 03:19.660
 I hope that you'll understand it better as well.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.060
 And of course, the tools that I will describe

03:22.060 --> 03:25.200
 should allow you to modulate and control

03:25.200 --> 03:28.240
 aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness,

03:28.240 --> 03:31.920
 and just generally to be able to engage with people

03:31.920 --> 03:34.060
 in a more adaptive way overall.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.720
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:36.720 --> 03:39.580
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:39.580 --> 03:42.000
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:42.000 --> 03:43.960
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

03:43.960 --> 03:45.880
 about science and science-related tools

03:45.880 --> 03:47.440
 to the general public.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.480
 In keeping with that theme,

03:48.480 --> 03:51.520
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.920
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.560
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:55.560 --> 03:57.640
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink

03:57.640 --> 04:00.920
 that's designed to meet all your foundational health needs.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.280
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.020
 So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.

04:07.020 --> 04:08.760
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

04:08.760 --> 04:10.360
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

04:10.360 --> 04:12.280
 once or twice a day is that it covers

04:12.280 --> 04:15.920
 all of my basic vitamin mineral and probiotic needs.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.820
 The probiotics are especially important to me.

04:17.820 --> 04:22.080
 There are now abundant data showing that the gut microbiome,

04:22.080 --> 04:24.400
 which is basically a community

04:24.400 --> 04:27.720
 of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts,

04:27.720 --> 04:31.540
 are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function,

04:31.540 --> 04:34.920
 for mood, and many other aspects of our health.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.520
 The gut microbiome thrives on probiotics

04:37.520 --> 04:40.600
 and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics

04:40.600 --> 04:42.720
 to optimize the gut microbiome.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.040
 Athletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery

04:45.040 --> 04:46.960
 from physical and mental exertion,

04:46.960 --> 04:50.360
 digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc,

04:50.360 --> 04:51.460
 as I mentioned before,

04:51.460 --> 04:53.260
 all the other vitamins and minerals that you need

04:53.260 --> 04:56.280
 in order to cover your basic needs each day.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.640
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

04:57.640 --> 05:00.400
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:00.400 --> 05:02.120
 and claim a special offer.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.680
 They'll give you five free travel packs

05:03.680 --> 05:05.240
 that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

05:05.240 --> 05:06.060
 while you're on the road

05:06.060 --> 05:08.600
 and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.800
 There's now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3

05:11.800 --> 05:13.640
 is important for many aspects

05:13.640 --> 05:15.960
 of our immediate and long-term health.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.960
 Many people, even if they get out in the sunlight,

05:17.960 --> 05:20.440
 are not getting enough vitamin D3.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.520
 And the K2 is thought to be beneficial

05:22.520 --> 05:24.000
 for calcium regulation

05:24.000 --> 05:26.440
 and a number of other things important to our health.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.200
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

05:29.200 --> 05:31.480
 you can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs

05:31.480 --> 05:34.520
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.200
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.000
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

05:39.000 --> 05:41.120
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.200
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

05:43.200 --> 05:45.680
 from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses

05:45.680 --> 05:49.080
 and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.440
 I've spent a lifetime working on the biology

05:51.440 --> 05:52.480
 of the visual system.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.420
 I can tell you that your visual system has to contend

05:54.420 --> 05:56.200
 with some pretty tough challenges

05:56.200 --> 05:57.240
 as you move throughout the day.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.600
 For instance, if you go from a brightly lit region

05:59.600 --> 06:02.520
 to a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.520
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed

06:04.520 --> 06:06.440
 with those sorts of adjustments in mind.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.320
 So for instance, if you're outside in the shade,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.080
 you move into the sun and then back into the shade,

06:10.080 --> 06:12.640
 you don't have to take your sunglasses on and off.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.000
 Their glasses were initially designed for sports performance

06:16.000 --> 06:17.820
 and the great thing is they can be used for that,

06:17.820 --> 06:19.760
 but also they have a terrific aesthetic

06:19.760 --> 06:21.880
 so you can wear them to work or out to dinner.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.080
 I wear readers at night and when I drive at night

06:25.080 --> 06:27.500
 and I wear sunglasses if I'm out a lot

06:27.500 --> 06:29.540
 on really bright days.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.200
 The terrific thing about Roca glasses

06:31.200 --> 06:33.220
 is that even if you get sweaty, they won't fall off

06:33.220 --> 06:35.600
 so you can run with them, you can cycle with them,

06:35.600 --> 06:36.560
 or as I mentioned before,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.460
 you can just wear them out and about.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.920
 If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,

06:40.920 --> 06:43.840
 that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman

06:43.840 --> 06:46.080
 to save 20% off your first order.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.240
 Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com

06:48.240 --> 06:50.560
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.440
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.460
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

06:55.460 --> 06:58.300
 that in my opinion are the very best you'll find.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.680
 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

07:00.680 --> 07:02.080
 a little over a year ago

07:02.080 --> 07:04.980
 and it's the best sleep I've had ever since.

07:04.980 --> 07:06.340
 If you go to the Helix site,

07:06.340 --> 07:08.800
 they have a terrific sleep quiz

07:08.800 --> 07:10.060
 that just takes a few minutes,

07:10.060 --> 07:12.760
 asks you questions like, do you tend to sleep on your side,

07:12.760 --> 07:14.020
 your back or your stomach?

07:14.020 --> 07:15.940
 Maybe you don't know because you're asleep,

07:15.940 --> 07:17.260
 but many people do know.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.800
 And even if you don't know, that's okay.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.080
 It will also ask you questions like,

07:20.080 --> 07:21.700
 do you tend to run hot or cold?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.800
 Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.060
 And by taking that brief quiz,

07:25.060 --> 07:27.020
 they will match you to the specific mattress

07:27.020 --> 07:29.800
 that's ideal for you and your sleep needs.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.520
 And that's really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.300
 Everybody's unique and they know that.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.440
 So if you take this quiz,

07:36.440 --> 07:37.800
 you'll get matched to a particular mattress.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.000
 For me, it was the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,

07:40.000 --> 07:41.040
 but again, that's just me.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.640
 And you may match to that one

07:42.640 --> 07:44.960
 or you may match to a different one.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.520
 If you're interested in upgrading your mattress

07:46.520 --> 07:50.040
 and sleeping much better, go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

07:50.040 --> 07:51.340
 take that two minute sleep quiz

07:51.340 --> 07:52.840
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress

07:52.840 --> 07:55.920
 and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order

07:55.920 --> 07:57.200
 and two free pillows.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.480
 I also love their pillows.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.720
 I've always had this issue with pillows

07:59.720 --> 08:01.040
 that they heat up too much.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.520
 I'm always looking for the pillow that can cool itself.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.580
 Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool.

08:05.580 --> 08:08.160
 They're also not too big, so they're not propped up.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.200
 Not getting the text neck in the middle of the night,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.480
 putting my chin pushed in my chest,

08:11.480 --> 08:14.440
 nor am I falling back and having trouble breathing

08:14.440 --> 08:15.280
 in the middle of the night.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.180
 They're designed just right.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.840
 They also have a 10 years warranty

08:17.840 --> 08:20.540
 and you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk-free.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.100
 They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,

08:22.100 --> 08:23.320
 but I think that you will.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.160
 Again, if you're interested,

08:24.160 --> 08:27.080
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

08:27.080 --> 08:30.040
 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.780
 Let's talk about aggression.

08:31.780 --> 08:35.860
 I think that many people out there are put off by aggression

08:35.860 --> 08:37.980
 although others are drawn to aggression,

08:37.980 --> 08:42.280
 both in themselves and when observing it in others.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.440
 The reason to talk about aggression is that,

08:44.440 --> 08:46.000
 as mentioned before,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.120
 the context of aggression really matters.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.740
 So there are instances where aggression is adaptive.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.300
 For instance, a mother protecting her children,

08:55.300 --> 08:56.400
 if she's being attacked

08:56.400 --> 08:57.580
 or if her children are being threatened,

08:57.580 --> 08:59.280
 I think most people would agree

08:59.280 --> 09:02.160
 that so-called maternal aggression of that sort,

09:02.160 --> 09:05.640
 provided the context is right, is a great thing.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.780
 Protecting our young is, after all,

09:07.780 --> 09:10.520
 one of the primary adaptive drives of our species,

09:10.520 --> 09:12.240
 and thank goodness it is.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.860
 Of course, other forms of aggression

09:13.860 --> 09:16.880
 like unprovoked proactive aggression,

09:16.880 --> 09:19.880
 somebody simply being violent to somebody else,

09:19.880 --> 09:21.220
 even when unprovoked.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.720
 Most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.120
 It can even evoke aggression in people

09:26.120 --> 09:28.700
 when they observe that kind of behavior.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.160
 So again, context really matters,

09:31.160 --> 09:34.880
 but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason

09:34.880 --> 09:37.760
 to think about and understand aggression

09:37.760 --> 09:39.580
 is that by understanding the biology

09:39.580 --> 09:41.520
 and psychology of aggression,

09:41.520 --> 09:43.840
 you will be in a much better position

09:43.840 --> 09:46.800
 to understand how all emotional states come to be,

09:46.800 --> 09:49.100
 both in yourself and in others.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.800
 For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement

09:52.800 --> 09:55.400
 that I believe arises from pop psychology,

09:55.400 --> 09:57.800
 not from formal academic psychology,

09:57.800 --> 10:01.220
 that aggression is just sadness.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.240
 It's a form of sadness that's amplified,

10:03.240 --> 10:05.020
 and it shows up as aggression.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.460
 But when we look at the underlying biology

10:07.460 --> 10:09.780
 and the peer-reviewed literature on this,

10:09.780 --> 10:11.600
 nothing could be further from the truth.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.920
 We have distinct circuits in the brain

10:13.920 --> 10:17.880
 for aggression versus grief and mourning.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.280
 Those are non-overlapping.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.960
 Now, that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive

10:21.960 --> 10:24.960
 or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.720
 But the idea that sadness and aggression

10:26.720 --> 10:30.440
 are one and the same thing is simply not true.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.260
 And by understanding that,

10:32.260 --> 10:35.800
 or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression

10:35.800 --> 10:37.080
 are not the same thing,

10:37.080 --> 10:39.080
 you'll be in a much better position to apply

10:39.080 --> 10:41.240
 some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode

10:41.240 --> 10:44.920
 in order to be able to reduce or eliminate,

10:44.920 --> 10:47.840
 or if it's adaptive to you, to modulate aggression.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.680
 And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression,

10:50.680 --> 10:54.480
 in some cases even amplifying aggression, can be adaptive.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.700
 Now, this of course is not the first discussion

10:56.700 --> 10:58.840
 about the biology of aggression

10:58.840 --> 11:00.320
 or the psychology of aggression.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.360
 And we really can look to the beginning of the last century

11:03.360 --> 11:07.360
 as the time in which the formal study of aggression

11:07.360 --> 11:08.720
 really began.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.960
 One of the names that's most associated

11:10.960 --> 11:12.880
 with the formal study of aggression

11:12.880 --> 11:15.680
 is none other than Konrad Lorenz.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.560
 Some of you may be familiar with that name.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.640
 Others of you may not be familiar with that name.

11:20.640 --> 11:25.420
 Konrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors

11:25.420 --> 11:27.960
 and fixed action pattern behaviors.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.840
 He's most famous, at least in scientific circles,

11:30.840 --> 11:34.360
 for getting geese to believe that he was their parent.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.560
 And if you were to put into Google Konrad with a K Lorenz,

11:37.560 --> 11:40.120
 just as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz geese,

11:40.120 --> 11:41.860
 you're going to see a lot of photos of Konrad

11:41.860 --> 11:44.240
 walking down roads with a lot of geese following him

11:44.240 --> 11:46.840
 or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.820
 He had a habit of geese adopting him

11:49.820 --> 11:51.740
 because of the behaviors that he partook in.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.240
 So he would swim out on a lake

11:53.240 --> 11:54.300
 in front of a bunch of little geese,

11:54.300 --> 11:55.960
 and then they would think that he was the parent

11:55.960 --> 11:56.880
 and they would imprint on him.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.360
 He even lived with these animals and they lived with him.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.620
 Sort of a strange character from what I hear.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.080
 But nonetheless, all this work was deserving

12:04.080 --> 12:06.480
 of a Nobel prize because what he discovered

12:06.480 --> 12:08.480
 were fixed action patterns.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.040
 That is patterns of behavior that could be evoked

12:12.040 --> 12:14.280
 by a single stimulus, okay?

12:14.280 --> 12:15.920
 This is really important.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.160
 The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors,

12:19.160 --> 12:22.560
 like swimming behind a parent

12:22.560 --> 12:26.640
 or looking to somebody for comfort and only them.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.640
 The idea that you could get a huge category

12:28.640 --> 12:31.000
 of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts

12:31.000 --> 12:34.600
 triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable

12:34.600 --> 12:37.180
 because what it suggested and what turns out to be true

12:37.180 --> 12:39.400
 is that there are neural circuits,

12:39.400 --> 12:40.740
 not just individual brain areas,

12:40.740 --> 12:43.060
 but collections of brain areas that work together

12:43.060 --> 12:45.680
 to engage a pattern of behaviors.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.560
 And that's the first fundamental principle

12:48.560 --> 12:50.280
 that we need to define today.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.600
 That when we talk about aggression,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.520
 we're talking about activation of neural circuits,

12:55.520 --> 12:56.980
 not individual brain areas,

12:56.980 --> 12:59.900
 but neural circuits that get played out in sequence,

12:59.900 --> 13:01.980
 like keys on a piano.

13:01.980 --> 13:05.120
 But that playing out in sequence means that aggression

13:05.120 --> 13:08.220
 is a verb, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end,

13:08.220 --> 13:10.920
 and it's a process, it's not an event.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.040
 And as you'll see, that turns out to be very important

13:13.040 --> 13:16.920
 in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression,

13:16.920 --> 13:21.060
 prevent it from happening before it's initiated,

13:21.060 --> 13:24.720
 or maybe even prolonging aggression if that's what's needed.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.000
 Now, Konrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.880
 I mean, obviously he knew there was this thing

13:29.880 --> 13:32.280
 that we call a brain and a nervous system,

13:32.280 --> 13:34.960
 and he knew that there were chemicals in the brain

13:34.960 --> 13:36.720
 and hormones and things of that sort

13:36.720 --> 13:38.240
 that were likely to play a role,

13:38.240 --> 13:40.160
 but he really didn't take any measures

13:40.160 --> 13:42.860
 to define what the neural circuits were.

13:42.860 --> 13:43.700
 Frankly, he didn't need to.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.040
 He had his Nobel Prize and he did all this beautiful work.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.800
 He's known for an abundance of work,

13:48.800 --> 13:53.260
 but he did think about what sorts of underlying processes

13:53.260 --> 13:55.760
 could drive something like aggression.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.600
 And he talked about one particular feature

13:58.600 --> 14:00.080
 that's especially important,

14:00.080 --> 14:02.560
 and that's this notion of a pressure.

14:02.560 --> 14:07.560
 The idea that, yes, certain hormones will bias somebody

14:08.760 --> 14:10.400
 or an animal to be aggressive.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.960
 Certain neurotransmitter states,

14:11.960 --> 14:13.400
 and you'll learn what those are today,

14:13.400 --> 14:16.720
 will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive,

14:16.720 --> 14:18.640
 maybe even submissive and passive,

14:18.640 --> 14:21.340
 maybe outright proactively aggressive

14:21.340 --> 14:23.720
 towards anyone or anything in front of them.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.640
 And yes, of course, there will be historical features

14:26.640 --> 14:29.320
 based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.540
 He understood that there will be a constellation of things

14:31.540 --> 14:34.600
 that would drive people to be aggressive.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.240
 And he described a so-called pressure,

14:36.240 --> 14:37.740
 almost like a hydraulic pressure.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.320
 Just think about fluid pressure in a small container

14:40.320 --> 14:42.280
 being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can

14:42.280 --> 14:44.480
 or the container is ready to explode,

14:44.480 --> 14:48.080
 and how multiple features, multiple variables

14:48.080 --> 14:51.220
 could impinge on that and create that pressure.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.980
 It turns out that's exactly the way the system works.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.540
 There is no single brain area

14:55.540 --> 14:57.840
 that flips the switch for aggression,

14:57.840 --> 14:59.620
 although we'll soon talk about a brain structure

14:59.620 --> 15:02.960
 that generally houses the propensity

15:02.960 --> 15:04.400
 and the output of aggression.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.720
 This notion of a hydraulic pressure

15:07.720 --> 15:10.480
 that can drive us toward aggressive behavior,

15:10.480 --> 15:14.480
 or conversely can be very low pressure

15:14.480 --> 15:16.640
 and keep us in a state of non-reactivity,

15:16.640 --> 15:19.660
 maybe even passivity or submissiveness,

15:19.660 --> 15:22.380
 is a very important feature because it really captures

15:22.380 --> 15:24.920
 the essence of how neural circuits work

15:24.920 --> 15:27.360
 when we're talking about primitive behaviors generally.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.320
 And you can start to notice this in yourself and in others.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.480
 You can start to notice

15:32.480 --> 15:34.800
 when you are veering toward aggression

15:34.800 --> 15:36.960
 or when someone is veering toward aggression,

15:36.960 --> 15:39.100
 verbal or physical.

15:39.100 --> 15:44.000
 Now, that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure

15:44.000 --> 15:45.420
 that Lorenz was referring to,

15:45.420 --> 15:48.220
 and it really does have an underlying biological basis.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.980
 Now, it was some years later

15:51.980 --> 15:54.500
 that the first experiments came along,

15:54.500 --> 15:57.940
 which really started to identify the brain areas

15:57.940 --> 16:00.600
 and the biological so-called pressures

16:00.600 --> 16:03.340
 that can induce aggressive behavior.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.140
 And the person that really gets credit for this

16:05.140 --> 16:08.100
 is a guy by the name of Walter Hess,

16:08.100 --> 16:10.780
 who at that time was working on cats.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.960
 And I know that when you say working on cats,

16:12.960 --> 16:13.860
 a lot of people will cringe,

16:13.860 --> 16:15.240
 a lot of people have cats as pets,

16:15.240 --> 16:17.380
 and certainly cats can be delightful.

16:17.380 --> 16:19.500
 Some people like them more, some people like them less.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.220
 Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.640
 I should say that these days,

16:24.640 --> 16:26.480
 very few laboratories work on cats.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.700
 Most laboratories that work on animal models

16:28.700 --> 16:31.220
 will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies

16:31.220 --> 16:33.380
 for their capacity to do genetics,

16:33.380 --> 16:37.220
 on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice.

16:37.220 --> 16:39.420
 And occasionally you'll find a lab

16:39.420 --> 16:41.400
 that still works on cats.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.300
 Back in the time of Hess,

16:43.300 --> 16:45.100
 very few laboratories worked on mice.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.380
 Most laboratories worked on cats or rats.

16:48.380 --> 16:49.940
 And the reason for that is nowadays,

16:49.940 --> 16:53.220
 most laboratories use mice if they use animal models

16:53.220 --> 16:55.560
 because of the genetic tools that exist in mice

16:55.560 --> 16:58.480
 to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera,

16:58.480 --> 17:01.100
 which can't be done in humans or non-human primates,

17:01.100 --> 17:04.660
 at least not very easily at this point in history.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.380
 So when I say he was working on cats,

17:06.380 --> 17:08.560
 I realized that probably evoked some negative emotions

17:08.560 --> 17:11.540
 in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.900
 What we can do, however, is look at the data

17:14.900 --> 17:17.980
 and make use of the data in terms of our understanding.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.880
 What Hess did was he had cats that were awake

17:22.880 --> 17:25.120
 and he was able to lower stimulating electrode

17:25.120 --> 17:25.960
 into their brain.

17:25.960 --> 17:26.780
 Now, keep in mind that the brain

17:26.780 --> 17:28.520
 does not have any pain sensors.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.860
 So after a small hole is made in the skull,

17:30.860 --> 17:32.300
 electrodes are lowered into the brain.

17:32.300 --> 17:35.380
 This is what's done commonly in human neurosurgery.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.440
 And he was able to stimulate different brain areas.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.180
 And he was sort of poking around.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.100
 And when I say sort of,

17:41.100 --> 17:44.660
 he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.160
 He wasn't just poking around in there for fun.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.220
 He was trying to identify brain regions

17:49.220 --> 17:53.780
 that could generate entire categories of behavior,

17:53.780 --> 17:55.300
 a la Lorenz, right?

17:55.300 --> 17:57.160
 These fixed action pattern behaviors.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.320
 Eventually, his electrode landed in a site

18:01.320 --> 18:03.980
 and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat

18:03.980 --> 18:08.980
 that caused this otherwise passive purring, relaxing cat

18:10.420 --> 18:13.120
 to suddenly go into an absolute rage.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.300
 So arched back, hissing, hair up,

18:16.300 --> 18:19.340
 so-called pyloerection where the hairs go up.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.340
 Animals try and make themselves as big as possible,

18:21.340 --> 18:22.900
 often when they're aggressive.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.180
 Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not,

18:27.180 --> 18:29.080
 cats and other animals can do this.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.020
 And the cat tried to attack him and anyone else

18:32.020 --> 18:36.260
 and anything else, even inanimate objects

18:36.260 --> 18:38.860
 when he stimulated this particular brain area.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.140
 So Hess obviously took notice

18:41.140 --> 18:44.100
 of this incredible transformation in behavior.

18:44.100 --> 18:47.280
 And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation

18:47.280 --> 18:48.780
 of this particular brain area,

18:48.780 --> 18:50.980
 the cat very quickly within seconds

18:50.980 --> 18:54.100
 went back to being passive calm kitty.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.580
 Now, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals

18:57.580 --> 19:00.780
 because he had to confirm that it wasn't just happenstance,

19:00.780 --> 19:04.340
 that there wasn't something unique about this one cat

19:04.340 --> 19:07.500
 that perhaps he had stimulated an area

19:07.500 --> 19:10.400
 that had been built up during the kittenhood

19:10.400 --> 19:13.560
 of this cat and had been reactivated.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.780
 Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life

19:15.780 --> 19:18.820
 or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit

19:18.820 --> 19:23.020
 unique to that cat created this aggressive behavior.

19:23.020 --> 19:23.860
 That wasn't the case.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.580
 Every cat that he looked at

19:26.580 --> 19:28.800
 and stimulated this particular brain area,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.300
 the cat would immediately go into an aggressive,

19:31.300 --> 19:32.540
 almost rage-type behavior.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.300
 Now, of course, we can't anthropomorphize.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.740
 We don't know what the cat was feeling.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.100
 For all we know, the cat could be happy,

19:37.100 --> 19:39.060
 although that seems pretty unlikely.

19:39.060 --> 19:43.820
 And later experiments done in mice, but also in humans,

19:43.820 --> 19:47.480
 confirm that indeed stimulation of this brain area

19:47.480 --> 19:49.820
 evoked not just behavioral aggression,

19:49.820 --> 19:53.340
 but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger.

19:53.340 --> 19:56.520
 So what was this incredible brain area?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.780
 Or rather, I should say, what is the brain area

19:58.780 --> 20:01.540
 that harbored this incredible capacity

20:01.540 --> 20:05.500
 to generate aggressive behavior in Hess's experiments?

20:06.460 --> 20:08.580
 Well, for those of you that are regular listeners

20:08.580 --> 20:11.620
 to this podcast, you'll probably be relieved to know

20:11.620 --> 20:12.780
 that today we're going to talk about

20:12.780 --> 20:14.380
 some new neural circuits.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.580
 Oftentimes we'll center back on the amygdala

20:17.580 --> 20:20.060
 or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up.

20:20.060 --> 20:21.860
 And for those of you that haven't heard them before,

20:21.860 --> 20:23.100
 don't worry, I'll make it clear

20:23.100 --> 20:26.040
 as to what those brain areas are and what they do.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.300
 But today we're going to talk a lot about

20:28.300 --> 20:33.020
 the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus.

20:33.020 --> 20:36.380
 The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus,

20:36.380 --> 20:38.780
 meaning a small collection of neurons.

20:38.780 --> 20:39.900
 What are neurons?

20:39.900 --> 20:41.300
 Nerve cells.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.500
 And that small collection of neurons

20:43.500 --> 20:46.420
 that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small.

20:46.420 --> 20:50.940
 It's only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain

20:50.940 --> 20:52.900
 and a matching 1,500 neurons

20:52.900 --> 20:54.420
 on the other side of your brain.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.700
 And that combined 3,000 neurons or so,

20:57.700 --> 21:00.720
 it's not exactly 3,000, but 3,000 neurons or so

21:01.620 --> 21:05.900
 is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior

21:05.900 --> 21:10.540
 of the sort that Hess observed in the cat.

21:10.540 --> 21:11.660
 And believe it or not,

21:11.660 --> 21:14.560
 when you see somebody who's in an act of rage

21:14.560 --> 21:17.080
 or in an act of verbal aggression

21:17.080 --> 21:19.240
 or in an act of defensive aggression,

21:19.240 --> 21:22.920
 protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera,

21:23.860 --> 21:28.300
 almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.660
 Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.340
 And next I'll describe some experiments

21:34.340 --> 21:37.740
 that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so,

21:37.740 --> 21:41.060
 but leading right up until this year and even last month

21:41.060 --> 21:43.980
 that keep confirming again and again and again

21:43.980 --> 21:45.580
 that it is the activity of neurons

21:45.580 --> 21:46.940
 in the ventromedial hypothalamus

21:46.940 --> 21:49.340
 that are both necessary and sufficient

21:49.340 --> 21:53.780
 to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.400
 Now, before I go further to describe

21:56.400 --> 21:59.580
 the beautiful recent studies on the VMH,

21:59.580 --> 22:01.220
 the ventromedial hypothalamus

22:01.220 --> 22:03.100
 and the important role of testosterone

22:03.100 --> 22:05.480
 and more importantly estrogen

22:05.480 --> 22:07.200
 in the activation of aggressive behavior.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.040
 That's right.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.800
 That's soon to be clear to you why that's the case.

22:11.700 --> 22:15.060
 I want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus

22:15.060 --> 22:16.540
 is something that we should all care about.

22:16.540 --> 22:17.820
 Why?

22:17.820 --> 22:21.380
 Well, it turns out that many categories

22:21.380 --> 22:24.860
 of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders

22:24.860 --> 22:26.360
 and psychological challenges,

22:26.360 --> 22:28.700
 things like schizophrenia, PTSD,

22:28.700 --> 22:31.680
 post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,

22:31.680 --> 22:33.880
 borderline personality disorder,

22:33.880 --> 22:35.960
 and even certain forms of autism

22:35.960 --> 22:39.000
 can include elements of aggression and even violence.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.700
 Now, it's certainly not the case

22:40.700 --> 22:42.980
 that aggression and violence are present

22:42.980 --> 22:46.820
 in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD

22:46.820 --> 22:50.340
 or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder.

22:50.340 --> 22:53.220
 I'm absolutely not saying that.

22:53.220 --> 22:56.060
 However, it can be a feature of those

22:56.060 --> 22:58.740
 and it's a well-described feature

22:58.740 --> 23:01.660
 in terms of trying to understand the constellation

23:01.660 --> 23:04.140
 of challenges that people suffer from when they have those.

23:04.140 --> 23:06.060
 So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond

23:06.060 --> 23:08.160
 just understanding basic aggression

23:08.160 --> 23:10.120
 in the context of adaptive aggression.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.160
 So, you know, when earlier I use the example

23:13.160 --> 23:14.200
 of maternal aggression,

23:14.200 --> 23:17.660
 that's one adaptive form of aggression.

23:17.660 --> 23:20.440
 It also can be pathologic aggression,

23:20.440 --> 23:22.500
 meaning it can harm ourselves or others.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.060
 So keep this in mind as we go forward

23:24.060 --> 23:26.580
 because later we're going to talk about specific tools

23:26.580 --> 23:30.220
 designed to modulate or prevent aggression

23:30.220 --> 23:31.240
 in, for instance,

23:31.240 --> 23:33.720
 people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

23:33.720 --> 23:35.740
 and especially kids with ADHD.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.100
 In the meantime, let's return to the VMH,

23:40.100 --> 23:42.320
 this relatively small collection of neurons.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.820
 And the reason I say relatively small is,

23:43.820 --> 23:47.200
 well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons,

23:47.200 --> 23:48.640
 maybe even trillions of neurons.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.640
 The exact number of neurons isn't really clear,

23:50.640 --> 23:52.020
 but it's a lot.

23:52.020 --> 23:56.080
 And it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons,

23:56.080 --> 23:59.680
 this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus

23:59.680 --> 24:02.500
 that can evoke this aggressive response.

24:04.220 --> 24:07.940
 Experiments done by David Anderson's lab at Caltech

24:07.940 --> 24:10.980
 were really the first to parse the fine circuitry

24:10.980 --> 24:13.980
 and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus

24:13.980 --> 24:17.280
 is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.340
 These are important experiments

24:18.340 --> 24:20.460
 and they're worth knowing about.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.500
 What they did was they identified,

24:24.500 --> 24:26.220
 first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus

24:26.220 --> 24:27.140
 was in the mouse.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.340
 That was pretty straightforward to do,

24:28.340 --> 24:30.780
 sort of known before they started these experiments.

24:30.780 --> 24:34.900
 And then they analyzed which genes,

24:34.900 --> 24:38.500
 meaning which DNA, which of course becomes RNA

24:38.500 --> 24:40.500
 and RNA becomes protein,

24:40.500 --> 24:44.200
 which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed

24:44.200 --> 24:47.860
 in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.540
 And it turns out that there's a particular category

24:50.540 --> 24:54.040
 of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus

24:54.040 --> 24:56.420
 that make an estrogen receptor.

24:57.300 --> 25:00.020
 And it is those neurons in particular

25:00.020 --> 25:04.080
 that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.020
 How did they know this?

25:05.020 --> 25:07.540
 Well, they used a tool that's actually been described

25:07.540 --> 25:09.160
 by a previous guest of this podcast.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.720
 We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bio engineer

25:11.720 --> 25:13.620
 and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine,

25:13.620 --> 25:14.820
 Carl Deisseroth.

25:14.820 --> 25:18.020
 He and others have developed tools

25:18.020 --> 25:21.620
 that allow people to control the activity of neurons

25:21.620 --> 25:22.860
 essentially by remote control,

25:22.860 --> 25:24.540
 by shining light on those neurons.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.860
 So in the context of an experiment on a mouse,

25:26.860 --> 25:28.240
 which is what David's lab did,

25:28.240 --> 25:30.180
 and these were the beautiful experiments of Dai Yu Lin,

25:30.180 --> 25:32.940
 who's now in her own laboratory at New York University,

25:33.900 --> 25:36.180
 put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain

25:36.180 --> 25:39.220
 of the hypo, into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse.

25:39.220 --> 25:43.500
 The mouse is able to move around in its cage, freely moving.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.380
 Even though it has a little tether, this little wire,

25:45.380 --> 25:46.580
 it's a very thin wire.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.360
 And that little thin wire is actually a little,

25:48.360 --> 25:49.460
 what we call optrode.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.820
 And the experimentalist, in this case, Dai Yu,

25:51.820 --> 25:55.620
 was able to stimulate the turning on

25:55.620 --> 25:57.700
 of a little bit of blue light.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.020
 And that blue light activated

26:00.020 --> 26:03.340
 only those estrogen receptor neurons

26:03.340 --> 26:06.260
 in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.400
 And the way she was able to do that

26:07.400 --> 26:09.700
 is she had introduced a gene

26:09.700 --> 26:13.140
 that had been developed by our friend, Carl Deisseroth,

26:13.140 --> 26:17.220
 that allows light to trigger electrical activity

26:17.220 --> 26:18.060
 in those neurons.

26:18.060 --> 26:19.180
 So if any of that is confusing

26:19.180 --> 26:21.120
 or if all of that is confusing, here's the experiment.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.160
 There's a mouse in a cage,

26:23.160 --> 26:24.620
 has a little wire coming out of its head.

26:24.620 --> 26:26.520
 It doesn't notice, believe it or not.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.340
 We know this because it's still eating and mating

26:28.340 --> 26:30.760
 and doing all the things that mice like to do

26:30.760 --> 26:33.220
 on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.340
 And the mere pressing of a button

26:35.340 --> 26:37.720
 will activate a little bit of light released

26:37.720 --> 26:38.680
 at the end of that wire.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.020
 That light activates particular neurons.

26:41.020 --> 26:43.940
 In this case, it's the estrogen receptor-containing neurons

26:43.940 --> 26:45.860
 in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.

26:47.860 --> 26:50.300
 When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse,

26:50.300 --> 26:51.300
 a couple of things happen,

26:51.300 --> 26:53.820
 depending on what the other mouse is,

26:53.820 --> 26:56.200
 or we could say who the other mouse is.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.020
 If it's a male mouse

26:58.020 --> 27:00.240
 and you put it in there with a female mouse,

27:00.240 --> 27:03.280
 the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.300
 Provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty,

27:05.300 --> 27:07.900
 he will try to mount and mate with a female mouse.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.220
 Now, female mice are either in a receptive phase

27:11.220 --> 27:13.740
 or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle.

27:13.740 --> 27:15.540
 They don't have a menstrual 28-day cycle.

27:15.540 --> 27:17.500
 They have an estrous cycle.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.000
 And on particular days of that estrous cycle,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.400
 they are not happy to mate.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.420
 They will basically keep their hindquarters

27:25.420 --> 27:27.540
 away from the male mouse at all costs.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.300
 They'll even attack the male mouse.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.600
 On certain days of the estrous cycle, however,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.780
 the female mouse will undergo what's called lordosis,

27:34.780 --> 27:36.300
 which is an arching of her back,

27:36.300 --> 27:39.760
 and she'll allow the male to mount and mate with her.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.560
 So a large number of experiments were done,

27:42.560 --> 27:46.420
 but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse in

27:46.420 --> 27:48.080
 with a female mouse who's in the so-called

27:48.080 --> 27:50.300
 receptive phase of estrous.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.140
 That is, she will allow mating.

27:52.140 --> 27:54.300
 And he starts mating with her.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.720
 And they go through the standard repertoire

27:56.720 --> 27:59.420
 of mating behaviors that you observe in mice,

28:00.380 --> 28:02.600
 mounting, thrusting, intromission,

28:02.600 --> 28:05.300
 as it's called in the mouse sex world.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.540
 Well, I guess, I don't know what the mice call it,

28:06.540 --> 28:08.360
 but that's what the experimenters call it.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.960
 And then afterwards that he will dismount, okay?

28:11.960 --> 28:15.420
 So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior.

28:15.420 --> 28:16.840
 It's very typical.

28:16.840 --> 28:20.080
 But about halfway through the behavior,

28:20.080 --> 28:23.560
 Dayu turned on the light to stimulate

28:23.560 --> 28:25.880
 these estrogen receptor-containing neurons

28:25.880 --> 28:27.200
 only in the male mouse.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.120
 And what she observed was incredibly dramatic.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.360
 The male mouse ceases from trying to mate

28:32.360 --> 28:34.000
 with the female mouse and immediately tries

28:34.000 --> 28:35.500
 to kill the female mouse.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.700
 He starts attacking her.

28:38.180 --> 28:41.120
 Then she turns off the light, the male stops,

28:41.120 --> 28:43.200
 and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.240
 I'm sure all of this was very confusing

28:45.240 --> 28:46.840
 and disturbing to the female mouse.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.340
 Nonetheless, that was the repertoire.

28:49.340 --> 28:50.480
 They would mate.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.420
 She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.680
 The male mouse would immediately try and attack

28:55.680 --> 28:57.800
 and kill the female mouse.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.660
 And then she would stop the stimulation

28:59.660 --> 29:02.280
 and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse

29:02.280 --> 29:04.880
 returned to the attempt at least

29:04.880 --> 29:06.460
 to mate with the female mouse.

29:07.680 --> 29:10.060
 These are such dramatic shifts in behavior

29:10.060 --> 29:11.880
 triggered only by the activation

29:11.880 --> 29:13.660
 of only the small set of neurons

29:13.660 --> 29:15.600
 within the ventromedial hypothalamus.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.340
 And for those of you that think that you can watch

29:18.340 --> 29:20.280
 this sort of thing without being disturbed,

29:20.280 --> 29:23.180
 I encourage you to go to YouTube.

29:23.180 --> 29:26.240
 We will provide a link where you can see a video

29:26.240 --> 29:27.180
 of this type of behavior.

29:27.180 --> 29:28.960
 It's incredibly dramatic.

29:28.960 --> 29:32.280
 The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.060
 It occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds,

29:35.060 --> 29:36.320
 thousandths of a second.

29:37.240 --> 29:41.040
 The next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse

29:41.040 --> 29:44.760
 with this stimulation with light capability

29:44.760 --> 29:47.740
 in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone,

29:47.740 --> 29:50.360
 but with a rubber glove filled with air or water.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.740
 Mouse is walking around sniffing, peeing,

29:52.740 --> 29:54.000
 which is what male mice seem to do.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.520
 They seem to urinate everywhere.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.000
 Essentially an interesting, perhaps interesting feature

29:58.000 --> 30:00.920
 of male mice and actually many male animals,

30:00.920 --> 30:03.820
 perhaps even humans, we don't know, or maybe we do know.

30:03.820 --> 30:06.580
 Basically, this has been observed time and time again

30:06.580 --> 30:09.360
 in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers' lab

30:09.360 --> 30:11.520
 at the Scripps Institute has characterized this.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.240
 If you put female mice into an arena or a cage,

30:14.240 --> 30:17.880
 they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.180
 Whereas if you put male mice into an arena or a cage,

30:21.180 --> 30:22.340
 they urinate everywhere.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.560
 They have this kind of obsession

30:23.560 --> 30:25.400
 with spraying their urine everywhere.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.600
 You can sort of transpose that

30:27.600 --> 30:29.320
 to human behavior if you like.

30:30.360 --> 30:34.720
 In any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone,

30:34.720 --> 30:36.280
 but with this rubber glove,

30:36.280 --> 30:38.720
 the mouse is walking around urinating, et cetera,

30:38.720 --> 30:40.200
 doing whatever it is that mice do.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.460
 Then she stimulates the activation

30:42.460 --> 30:44.920
 of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons,

30:44.920 --> 30:48.400
 and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.440
 It goes into a rage attacking the glove

30:50.440 --> 30:55.040
 as if it were another mouse or some other animate object,

30:55.040 --> 30:56.780
 but of course it's an inanimate object.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.360
 It's just a rubber glove.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.480
 She stops the stimulation,

30:59.480 --> 31:02.000
 and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm

31:02.000 --> 31:03.840
 or at least not attacking.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.680
 Again, we don't know what the mouse was feeling.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.480
 So these are very dramatic videos.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.080
 Again, you can see them by following the link

31:10.080 --> 31:11.880
 that we'll provide in the caption.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.160
 If that sort of thing is going to disturb you

31:14.160 --> 31:17.360
 to see, for instance, one mouse attacking another,

31:17.360 --> 31:18.760
 please just don't watch them.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.580
 I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody,

31:21.580 --> 31:23.480
 or you traumatizing yourself, that is.

31:24.540 --> 31:26.000
 A number of different variations

31:26.000 --> 31:27.080
 were done on this experiment.

31:27.080 --> 31:32.080
 For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice

31:32.680 --> 31:33.760
 as opposed to male mice,

31:33.760 --> 31:36.680
 putting the female mice in with other female mice

31:36.680 --> 31:38.400
 or with other male mice,

31:38.400 --> 31:41.980
 no matter what variation one carries out,

31:41.980 --> 31:43.680
 so it doesn't matter if it's male with female,

31:43.680 --> 31:47.400
 male with male, female with female, et cetera,

31:47.400 --> 31:50.080
 stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus

31:50.080 --> 31:52.320
 in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes

31:52.320 --> 31:55.080
 this very dramatic, almost instantaneous,

31:55.080 --> 31:57.680
 aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.120
 Subsequent experiments done by Dai-Yu Lin

32:01.120 --> 32:03.540
 in her own laboratory and other laboratories

32:03.540 --> 32:05.840
 have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus

32:05.840 --> 32:07.720
 is connected with a bunch of other brain areas

32:07.720 --> 32:08.560
 that are interesting,

32:08.560 --> 32:10.520
 and I'll talk about some of those in a little bit,

32:10.520 --> 32:13.960
 but one of them that I want to call out now

32:13.960 --> 32:17.240
 is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.220
 This is a large structure in the back of the brain

32:20.220 --> 32:23.800
 that houses things like neurons that can create opioids.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.040
 We all know of the opioid crisis,

32:25.040 --> 32:28.920
 but these are neurons that can produce endogenous means

32:28.920 --> 32:33.720
 made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.800
 You could understand why that might occur

32:35.800 --> 32:37.260
 in a circuit for aggression, right?

32:37.260 --> 32:39.720
 Even if one is the aggressor,

32:39.720 --> 32:42.800
 it's likely that they may incur some physical damage

32:42.800 --> 32:44.440
 and they'd want some pain relief.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.340
 The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits

32:49.340 --> 32:53.440
 that eventually, through several processing stations,

32:53.440 --> 32:56.200
 excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws,

32:56.200 --> 32:58.640
 and in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus

32:58.640 --> 33:01.820
 can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior.

33:01.820 --> 33:05.240
 Now, aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting

33:05.240 --> 33:08.440
 because in humans, and especially in human children,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.540
 biting is something that,

33:10.540 --> 33:13.440
 while young children might do as a form of aggression,

33:13.440 --> 33:17.040
 tends to disappear pretty early in childhood,

33:17.040 --> 33:21.540
 and if it doesn't, it's often seen as a mark of pathology.

33:21.540 --> 33:22.680
 I have a story about this, actually.

33:22.680 --> 33:27.140
 When I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp,

33:27.140 --> 33:29.080
 and I'll never forget this.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.400
 We were playing soccer,

33:30.400 --> 33:34.040
 and in a rare stroke of luck or accident,

33:34.040 --> 33:35.080
 I happened to score a goal.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.560
 I wasn't a particularly good soccer player,

33:36.560 --> 33:37.920
 especially not at that stage in my life.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.720
 They later figured out that it was just better

33:39.720 --> 33:40.740
 to make me a fullback,

33:40.740 --> 33:43.440
 because I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.720
 I was better at taking the ball or the person out

33:45.720 --> 33:49.460
 than I was putting the ball in the goal.

33:49.460 --> 33:53.320
 Nonetheless, I, again, by chance, I scored a goal,

33:53.320 --> 33:55.880
 and I was trotting back to my side of the field,

33:55.880 --> 33:59.600
 and all of a sudden, I felt this sting in my back.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.280
 A kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name,

34:03.280 --> 34:05.160
 I'm not going to tell you what his name was,

34:05.160 --> 34:09.420
 a kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back,

34:09.420 --> 34:12.440
 and this, of course, resulted in a discussion

34:12.440 --> 34:14.800
 and a timeout and all the usual things,

34:14.800 --> 34:16.520
 and parents, I think, got involved.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.720
 I don't recall.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.180
 I didn't think much else of it,

34:19.180 --> 34:21.440
 but I recall that this was considered

34:21.440 --> 34:23.760
 especially troubling behavior,

34:23.760 --> 34:25.960
 because he bit me as opposed to hit me

34:25.960 --> 34:27.920
 or shoved me down or something of that sort,

34:27.920 --> 34:31.520
 and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting

34:31.520 --> 34:34.520
 as an aggressive behavior is associated

34:34.520 --> 34:35.920
 with a more primitive circuitry.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.800
 Now, here, I'm truly anthropomorphizing.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.720
 I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking

34:39.720 --> 34:40.900
 or feeling at the time.

34:40.900 --> 34:41.740
 How could I?

34:41.740 --> 34:44.460
 And I certainly am not going to say that biting

34:44.460 --> 34:48.060
 in every case reflects a pathology,

34:48.060 --> 34:50.360
 although I think there is general agreement

34:50.360 --> 34:52.680
 in the psychology community and the psychiatric community

34:52.680 --> 34:55.480
 that past a certain age, the using of one's teeth

34:55.480 --> 34:58.500
 to impart aggression and damage on others

34:58.500 --> 35:01.660
 is a particularly primitive and troubling,

35:01.660 --> 35:02.800
 or at least for the observer,

35:02.800 --> 35:06.320
 the person that experiences a pretty disturbing event.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.980
 Daew's lab has shown that activation

35:08.980 --> 35:10.220
 of the ventromedial hypothalamus

35:10.220 --> 35:13.240
 triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray,

35:13.240 --> 35:15.780
 which then triggers a whole other set of circuits

35:15.780 --> 35:17.020
 of fixed action patterns.

35:17.020 --> 35:20.760
 Here we are back to Lorenz again with fixed action patterns,

35:20.760 --> 35:24.320
 including swinging of the limbs, right, punching.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.700
 This wouldn't necessarily be controlled punching,

35:26.700 --> 35:28.600
 but also biting behavior.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.400
 So it's remarkable to me at least

35:30.400 --> 35:32.360
 that we have circuits in our brain

35:32.360 --> 35:36.160
 that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth

35:36.160 --> 35:38.640
 or violent use of things like our limbs

35:38.640 --> 35:41.340
 that of course could be used for things like singing

35:41.340 --> 35:45.600
 or kissing or eating or gesticulating

35:45.600 --> 35:48.120
 in any kind of polite or impolite way.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.440
 The point here is that neural circuits,

35:51.440 --> 35:53.000
 not individual brain areas,

35:53.000 --> 35:54.780
 evoke the constellation of behaviors

35:54.780 --> 35:56.400
 that we call aggression.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.800
 Now, many of you are probably puzzled

35:57.800 --> 35:59.560
 or at least should be

35:59.560 --> 36:01.240
 because I've been talking about

36:01.240 --> 36:02.800
 this highly specialized brain area,

36:02.800 --> 36:04.000
 the ventromedial hypothalamus,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.960
 and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons

36:07.960 --> 36:09.240
 in the ventromedial hypothalamus,

36:09.240 --> 36:11.920
 these neurons that make estrogen receptor.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.840
 And yet the activation of those cells

36:14.840 --> 36:17.580
 triggers dramatic and immediate aggression,

36:17.580 --> 36:19.600
 both in males and in females

36:19.600 --> 36:22.280
 and both against males and against females.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.600
 So what's going on here?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.600
 Most of us think about estrogen

36:26.600 --> 36:29.500
 and we don't immediately think of aggression.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.240
 Most of us hear testosterone

36:31.240 --> 36:32.600
 and we might think about aggression,

36:32.600 --> 36:34.100
 although other things as well.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.020
 In order to understand this,

36:36.020 --> 36:39.580
 I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation

36:39.580 --> 36:41.040
 that I had on a previous episode

36:41.040 --> 36:42.240
 of the Huberman Lab podcast

36:42.240 --> 36:44.280
 and that was with my colleague,

36:44.280 --> 36:45.920
 the great Robert Sapolsky,

36:45.920 --> 36:47.200
 of course, as a professor at Stanford

36:47.200 --> 36:50.360
 who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior

36:50.360 --> 36:51.860
 as well as estrogen and other hormones

36:51.860 --> 36:53.400
 and their impacts on behavior.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.240
 To make a long story short

36:56.240 --> 37:01.240
 and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth,

37:01.260 --> 37:05.000
 testosterone does not increase aggressiveness.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.840
 Testosterone increases proactivity

37:07.840 --> 37:10.440
 and the willingness to lean into effort

37:10.440 --> 37:12.420
 in competitive scenarios.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.840
 Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis,

37:15.840 --> 37:20.480
 but to make a long story short,

37:20.480 --> 37:22.480
 if people are given testosterone

37:22.480 --> 37:26.560
 or if you look at people who have different levels,

37:26.560 --> 37:28.600
 excuse me, of testosterone endogenously

37:28.600 --> 37:30.080
 that they naturally make,

37:30.080 --> 37:32.600
 what you'll find is that testosterone

37:32.600 --> 37:34.840
 tends to increase competitiveness,

37:34.840 --> 37:37.320
 but not just in aggressive scenarios.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.360
 So if somebody is already aggressive,

37:40.360 --> 37:43.740
 giving them testosterone will have the tendency

37:43.740 --> 37:45.200
 to make them more aggressive.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.420
 If somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic,

37:49.420 --> 37:50.400
 giving them testosterone

37:50.400 --> 37:52.500
 will make them more benevolent and altruistic,

37:52.500 --> 37:53.680
 at least up to a point.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.240
 Now, of course, there are certain forms

37:55.240 --> 37:58.520
 of synthetic testosterone that are known

37:58.520 --> 38:03.040
 in sports circles and in other circles

38:03.040 --> 38:04.720
 to increase aggressiveness

38:04.720 --> 38:06.340
 because of the way those particular forms

38:06.340 --> 38:08.080
 of synthetic testosterone work.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.560
 But in general, most of the experiments

38:09.560 --> 38:11.160
 that I'm referring to have not been done using those.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.200
 They've been done using the,

38:13.200 --> 38:15.640
 let's call them the more traditional

38:15.640 --> 38:17.280
 biological forms of testosterone

38:17.280 --> 38:19.740
 or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone.

38:19.740 --> 38:21.660
 In fact, Robert Sapolsky described

38:21.660 --> 38:23.040
 a really interesting experiment

38:23.040 --> 38:26.360
 in which if you look at testosterone levels

38:26.360 --> 38:28.460
 or you administer additional testosterone

38:28.460 --> 38:30.640
 to people who are doing philanthropy,

38:30.640 --> 38:33.520
 giving money to organizations,

38:33.520 --> 38:34.960
 and so they're essentially doing good

38:34.960 --> 38:37.200
 because these are organizations doing good,

38:37.200 --> 38:40.160
 what you find is that increased testosterone

38:40.160 --> 38:42.220
 or further increasing testosterone

38:42.220 --> 38:43.760
 makes people more willing to compete

38:43.760 --> 38:45.600
 to give more money than the other person in the room

38:45.600 --> 38:48.140
 in order to put it in air quotes,

38:48.140 --> 38:51.000
 to alpha out the other person by giving more money.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.680
 So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.520
 It is not an act of aggression.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.040
 Of course, we don't know what the people

38:58.040 --> 38:59.720
 are feeling underneath all that.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.240
 Again, we can't anthropomorphize

39:01.240 --> 39:04.100
 or project onto other people what they're feeling.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.820
 But the point is that testosterone itself

39:06.820 --> 39:08.800
 does not make people more aggressive.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.960
 And in the experiments that we've been talking about

39:11.960 --> 39:14.480
 up until now, it's actually the activation

39:14.480 --> 39:17.040
 of estrogen receptor containing neurons

39:17.040 --> 39:19.240
 that makes these animals more aggressive.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.760
 And it turns out there's evidence

39:20.760 --> 39:22.600
 that in certain contexts,

39:22.600 --> 39:24.580
 estrogen can make people more aggressive.

39:24.580 --> 39:25.780
 So what's going on here?

39:26.660 --> 39:29.140
 Well, what's going on is that

39:29.140 --> 39:32.500
 testosterone can be converted into estrogen

39:32.500 --> 39:34.680
 through a process called aromatization.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.640
 There's an enzyme called aromatase.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.680
 Anytime you have a word that ends in A-S-E,

39:39.680 --> 39:41.400
 at least if it's in the context of biology,

39:41.400 --> 39:43.240
 it's almost always, not always,

39:43.240 --> 39:45.340
 but almost always an enzyme.

39:45.340 --> 39:49.360
 So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.200
 And it is actually testosterone aromatized,

39:54.200 --> 39:56.160
 converted into estrogen,

39:56.160 --> 40:00.300
 and then binding to these estrogen-containing neurons

40:00.300 --> 40:04.460
 in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.300
 I want to repeat that.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.360
 It is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.120
 It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen

40:11.120 --> 40:14.680
 within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor

40:14.680 --> 40:17.160
 containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus

40:17.160 --> 40:21.100
 that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that.

40:21.100 --> 40:24.680
 Now, this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain

40:24.680 --> 40:28.880
 is very robust, so much so that if you take a mouse

40:28.880 --> 40:30.720
 that lacks the aromatase enzyme

40:30.720 --> 40:33.120
 or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme,

40:33.120 --> 40:34.400
 and they do exist,

40:35.800 --> 40:39.880
 then there is a reduction in overall aggression

40:39.880 --> 40:42.960
 despite high levels of testosterone.

40:42.960 --> 40:47.960
 And if people who, or mice who have the aromatase enzyme

40:48.200 --> 40:50.400
 have that enzyme blocked,

40:50.400 --> 40:51.640
 well, then it doesn't matter

40:51.640 --> 40:53.480
 how much you increase testosterone

40:53.480 --> 40:55.440
 or any of its other derivatives.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.660
 You do not observe this aggression.

40:58.660 --> 41:01.040
 So this runs counter to everything that we know

41:01.040 --> 41:03.280
 and think about the role of testosterone.

41:03.280 --> 41:06.360
 Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.800
 It can increase the desire to work under challenge.

41:09.800 --> 41:14.280
 I've said it before, and I ran this or pressure tested this

41:14.280 --> 41:16.880
 against Robert Sapolsky, who's been working on testosterone

41:16.880 --> 41:20.580
 and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now.

41:20.580 --> 41:25.040
 It is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect

41:25.040 --> 41:26.680
 of making effort feel good,

41:26.680 --> 41:29.660
 or at least increasing the threshold

41:29.660 --> 41:32.840
 at which effort feels bad or unsustainable.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.480
 And it does that by way of changing the activity

41:36.480 --> 41:38.960
 or the threshold for activation of brain structures

41:38.960 --> 41:40.760
 like the amygdala and other brain structures

41:40.760 --> 41:42.800
 associated with anxiety.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.480
 So the next time somebody says

41:44.480 --> 41:46.120
 testosterone makes people aggressive,

41:46.120 --> 41:49.460
 you can say, ah, no, actually it's estrogen

41:49.460 --> 41:51.280
 that makes people aggressive

41:51.280 --> 41:53.860
 and animals aggressive for that matter.

41:53.860 --> 41:55.660
 Now, of course, it is the case

41:55.660 --> 42:00.240
 that because males have relatively less estrogen

42:00.240 --> 42:03.220
 circulating in their brain and body than females, right?

42:03.220 --> 42:05.120
 Because they have testes, not ovaries,

42:05.120 --> 42:09.440
 that testosterone is required in the first place

42:09.440 --> 42:11.320
 in order to be converted into estrogen

42:11.320 --> 42:13.620
 to activate this aggressive circuit

42:13.620 --> 42:16.160
 involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons

42:16.160 --> 42:17.880
 in the ventromedial hypothalamus.

42:17.880 --> 42:22.880
 But nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.440
 It is the hormone on which aggression hinges.

42:27.440 --> 42:28.720
 And I think for most people,

42:28.720 --> 42:30.600
 that's a quite surprising finding.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.360
 And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings

42:33.360 --> 42:36.280
 in both the animal and human literature

42:36.280 --> 42:38.400
 as it relates to hormones

42:38.400 --> 42:40.560
 and psychological states and behavior.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.600
 Now, of course, it is the case that if testosterone is low,

42:44.600 --> 42:46.680
 that a person or an animal

42:46.680 --> 42:50.000
 will exhibit less aggressive behavior,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.400
 but that's not because of reduced testosterone per se,

42:52.400 --> 42:55.880
 it's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone,

42:55.880 --> 42:57.400
 meaning if there's no testosterone

42:57.400 --> 43:00.400
 to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.360
 So we've established that it's not testosterone,

43:03.360 --> 43:05.920
 but testosterone converted into estrogen

43:05.920 --> 43:08.660
 that activates these circuits for aggression.

43:08.660 --> 43:12.080
 But nonetheless, it's still surprising, right?

43:12.080 --> 43:14.600
 I mean, most of us don't think about estrogen

43:14.600 --> 43:17.440
 as the hormone that stimulates aggression,

43:17.440 --> 43:19.280
 but turns out it's all contextual.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.760
 There are beautiful data

43:21.760 --> 43:26.120
 showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression

43:26.120 --> 43:28.620
 can be powerfully modulated

43:28.620 --> 43:31.760
 by whether or not days are short or days are long.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.000
 In other words, whether or not

43:33.000 --> 43:35.280
 there's a lot of sunshine or not.

43:35.280 --> 43:39.800
 Now, obviously brain is encased in skull,

43:39.800 --> 43:41.320
 so it doesn't really know

43:41.320 --> 43:42.640
 if there's a lot of sunshine out there,

43:42.640 --> 43:44.160
 even though you can see the sun with your eyes,

43:44.160 --> 43:46.360
 you can feel it on your skin.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.880
 Day length is converted into hormonal signals

43:49.880 --> 43:50.800
 and chemical signals,

43:50.800 --> 43:53.000
 and the primary hormonal and chemical signals

43:53.000 --> 43:57.720
 involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.700
 So to make a very long story short,

43:59.700 --> 44:01.860
 in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight,

44:01.860 --> 44:04.320
 both in our eyes and on our skin,

44:04.320 --> 44:06.000
 melatonin levels are reduced.

44:06.000 --> 44:06.920
 Melatonin is a hormone

44:06.920 --> 44:10.580
 that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.120
 It also tends to activate pathways

44:12.120 --> 44:14.680
 that tend to reduce things like breeding

44:14.680 --> 44:16.560
 and sexual behavior.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.080
 In long days, dopamine is increased.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.600
 Dopamine is a molecule associated

44:20.600 --> 44:23.860
 with feelings of wellbeing and motivation,

44:23.860 --> 44:27.320
 and the desire to seek out all sorts of things,

44:27.320 --> 44:29.200
 all sorts of motivated behaviors.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.020
 And in long days,

44:31.020 --> 44:33.760
 provided we're getting enough sunlight on our skin

44:33.760 --> 44:36.080
 and to our eyes,

44:36.080 --> 44:38.420
 the stress hormones, especially cortisol

44:38.420 --> 44:39.720
 and some of the other stress hormones

44:39.720 --> 44:40.920
 are reduced in levels.

44:42.420 --> 44:45.760
 If estrogen levels are increased experimentally

44:45.760 --> 44:48.120
 under long day conditions,

44:48.120 --> 44:49.960
 it does not evoke aggression.

44:49.960 --> 44:53.280
 However, in short days, if estrogen is increased,

44:53.280 --> 44:56.240
 there's a heightened predisposition for aggression.

44:56.240 --> 44:59.420
 And that makes perfect sense

44:59.420 --> 45:01.360
 if you think about what short days do

45:01.360 --> 45:03.520
 to the biology of your brain and body.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.320
 In short days, the melatonin signal goes up.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.740
 There's more melatonin circulating

45:07.740 --> 45:09.700
 for more of each 24 hour cycle.

45:10.780 --> 45:13.440
 Stress hormones are circulating more.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.280
 Why?

45:14.280 --> 45:16.240
 Short days tend to be associated with winter.

45:16.240 --> 45:19.480
 In winter, we are bombarded with more bacteria and viruses

45:19.480 --> 45:24.020
 because bacteria and viruses actually survive better

45:24.020 --> 45:25.600
 in cold than they do in heat.

45:25.600 --> 45:26.520
 In fact, in my laboratory,

45:26.520 --> 45:28.280
 we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria

45:28.280 --> 45:29.380
 and when we want to keep them alive,

45:29.380 --> 45:30.600
 we put them in the freezer.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.600
 If we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them,

45:32.600 --> 45:34.120
 we put them under UV light

45:34.120 --> 45:35.720
 like you would see from the sunlight.

45:35.720 --> 45:38.680
 So shorter days are conducive to aggression,

45:38.680 --> 45:41.600
 not because days are short per se,

45:41.600 --> 45:43.800
 but because stress hormone levels are higher

45:43.800 --> 45:47.520
 and because dopamine levels are lower.

45:47.520 --> 45:48.900
 Now here's where all of this starts to converge

45:48.900 --> 45:51.320
 on a very clear biological picture,

45:51.320 --> 45:53.200
 a very clear psychological picture,

45:53.200 --> 45:55.800
 and indeed a very clear set of tools

45:55.800 --> 45:57.580
 that we can think about and use.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.380
 Under conditions where cortisol is high,

46:01.380 --> 46:04.360
 where the stress hormone is elevated,

46:04.360 --> 46:07.840
 and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin

46:07.840 --> 46:11.680
 is reduced, there is a greater propensity

46:11.680 --> 46:14.020
 for estrogen to trigger aggression.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.480
 Now, again, I know I've said it before,

46:17.480 --> 46:20.660
 but for males who make a lot of testosterone

46:20.660 --> 46:23.880
 relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind

46:23.880 --> 46:26.380
 this idea that if testosterone is high,

46:26.380 --> 46:27.800
 that means that estrogen is low

46:27.800 --> 46:31.360
 because while that can be true in the periphery in the body,

46:31.360 --> 46:33.240
 if testosterone is high,

46:33.240 --> 46:35.320
 there is going to be some aromatization,

46:35.320 --> 46:37.240
 that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.520
 So anytime you hear that testosterone is high,

46:39.520 --> 46:42.160
 you should think testosterone is high in the body

46:42.160 --> 46:43.760
 and perhaps estrogen is low in the body,

46:43.760 --> 46:45.640
 but that means that there's going to be heightened levels

46:45.640 --> 46:47.400
 of estrogen in the brain

46:47.400 --> 46:50.520
 and therefore increased propensity for aggression.

46:51.480 --> 46:54.520
 In females who generally make less testosterone

46:54.520 --> 46:55.960
 relative to estrogen,

46:57.520 --> 46:59.800
 there is sufficient estrogen already present

46:59.800 --> 47:01.660
 to trigger aggression.

47:01.660 --> 47:06.280
 So both males and females are primed for aggression,

47:06.280 --> 47:09.240
 but that's riding on a context

47:09.240 --> 47:12.040
 and that context of whether or not you get a tendency

47:12.040 --> 47:13.880
 for aggression or not

47:13.880 --> 47:16.320
 depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low

47:16.320 --> 47:19.760
 and I'm telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher

47:19.760 --> 47:22.820
 in any individual, there's going to be a tilt,

47:22.820 --> 47:25.240
 an increase in that hydraulic pressure

47:25.240 --> 47:28.440
 that Lorenz talked about toward aggression.

47:29.400 --> 47:33.520
 And if serotonin, the neuromodulator

47:33.520 --> 47:35.880
 that is associated with feelings of wellbeing

47:35.880 --> 47:38.160
 and sometimes even of slight passivity,

47:38.160 --> 47:41.480
 but certainly of wellbeing, if serotonin is low,

47:41.480 --> 47:43.620
 there's also going to be a further shift

47:43.620 --> 47:46.280
 towards an aggressive tendency.

47:46.280 --> 47:50.080
 So if we return to Lorenz's hydraulic pressure model

47:50.080 --> 47:52.840
 of aggression and other internal states,

47:52.840 --> 47:55.620
 we realize that external stimuli,

47:55.620 --> 47:57.900
 things that we hear, things that we see,

47:57.900 --> 47:59.860
 for instance, someone saying something upsetting

47:59.860 --> 48:03.000
 or us seeing somebody do something

48:03.000 --> 48:06.680
 that we don't like to others or to us,

48:06.680 --> 48:08.920
 as well as our internal state,

48:08.920 --> 48:11.040
 our subjective feelings of wellbeing,

48:11.040 --> 48:12.400
 but also our stress level,

48:12.400 --> 48:15.280
 our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources

48:15.280 --> 48:17.120
 and are content with what we have,

48:17.120 --> 48:18.840
 all of that is converging on this thing

48:18.840 --> 48:21.280
 that we call internal state and creating this pressure

48:21.280 --> 48:23.660
 of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive.

48:23.660 --> 48:26.020
 And now we have some major players

48:26.020 --> 48:29.100
 feeding into that final pathway,

48:29.100 --> 48:30.360
 that question of whether or not

48:30.360 --> 48:31.680
 will we hit the other person?

48:31.680 --> 48:35.160
 Will we say the thing that is considered aggressive?

48:35.160 --> 48:36.640
 Will we not say it?

48:36.640 --> 48:39.620
 If somebody says something or does something aggressive

48:39.620 --> 48:41.880
 to us, will we respond or will we be submissive

48:41.880 --> 48:43.520
 or even passive?

48:43.520 --> 48:46.640
 Again, there are many things funneling into that question

48:46.640 --> 48:48.160
 and dictating whether or not the answer is,

48:48.160 --> 48:49.540
 absolutely, I'll fight back,

48:49.540 --> 48:51.920
 or I'm going to attack them even unprovoked,

48:51.920 --> 48:54.020
 or if they say this, I'm going to do that,

48:54.020 --> 48:57.120
 or no matter what they do, I'm not going to respond.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.040
 These kinds of things are very complex

48:59.040 --> 49:00.980
 and yet we really can boil them down

49:00.980 --> 49:02.560
 to just a few common elements.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.080
 And I'm telling you that those elements

49:04.080 --> 49:08.240
 are whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower

49:08.240 --> 49:09.420
 or relatively higher.

49:09.420 --> 49:11.280
 Again, relatively higher is going to tend

49:11.280 --> 49:13.680
 to make people more reactive, why?

49:13.680 --> 49:17.080
 Because reactivity is really a function

49:17.080 --> 49:18.940
 of the autonomic nervous system,

49:18.940 --> 49:21.040
 which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates

49:21.040 --> 49:24.080
 between the so-called sympathetic arm

49:24.080 --> 49:25.160
 of the autonomic nervous system,

49:25.160 --> 49:27.160
 which tends to put us into a state of readiness

49:27.160 --> 49:28.680
 through the release of adrenaline.

49:28.680 --> 49:29.940
 Cortisol and adrenaline,

49:29.940 --> 49:31.560
 when they're circulating in the brain and body,

49:31.560 --> 49:34.760
 make us more likely to move and to react and to speak.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.280
 It's actually what will induce a kind of low-level tremor,

49:37.280 --> 49:38.840
 which is an anticipatory tremor

49:38.840 --> 49:40.840
 to be able to move more quickly, right?

49:40.840 --> 49:44.020
 A body in motion is more easily set into further motion,

49:44.020 --> 49:44.860
 that is.

49:45.900 --> 49:50.040
 And the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator

49:50.040 --> 49:54.880
 that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing

49:54.880 --> 49:56.400
 in response to what we already have.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.280
 So when we are well-fed,

49:58.280 --> 50:00.480
 serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body,

50:00.480 --> 50:02.560
 in particular, well-fed with carbohydrates.

50:02.560 --> 50:06.360
 The precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.

50:06.360 --> 50:09.240
 And indeed, there are nice studies exploring

50:09.240 --> 50:12.400
 the types of diets, nutritional programs,

50:12.400 --> 50:15.280
 that can reduce aggressive behavior,

50:15.280 --> 50:16.960
 both in children and in adults.

50:16.960 --> 50:20.760
 And tryptophan-rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan.

50:20.760 --> 50:24.240
 So for tryptophan-rich diets, things like white turkey meat,

50:24.240 --> 50:25.880
 but then there are also a number of carbohydrates.

50:25.880 --> 50:28.360
 You can look up, it's very easy to find,

50:28.360 --> 50:30.400
 foods that contain lots of tryptophan.

50:30.400 --> 50:34.960
 Those foods contain the precursor to serotonin.

50:34.960 --> 50:37.140
 Now, it isn't simply the case that eating more foods

50:37.140 --> 50:39.960
 with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.760
 I suppose it could do that if you ate it in abundance,

50:42.760 --> 50:43.800
 it could make you tired,

50:43.800 --> 50:45.680
 and then you're less likely to be aggressive.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.720
 I don't recommend that strategy.

50:47.720 --> 50:51.680
 But the idea here is that when it's been explored,

50:51.680 --> 50:53.520
 increasing levels of tryptophan,

50:53.520 --> 50:55.520
 either by supplementation or by food,

50:55.520 --> 50:59.100
 or drugs, prescription drugs that increase serotonin,

50:59.100 --> 51:01.560
 so for instance, fluoxetine, sometimes called Prozac

51:01.560 --> 51:03.880
 or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs,

51:03.880 --> 51:05.760
 tend to reduce aggressive behavior.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.900
 Now, not always, but in general, that's the case.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.240
 Similarly, because elevated cortisol

51:11.240 --> 51:13.120
 tends to shift the whole system,

51:13.120 --> 51:15.080
 again, create more of a hydraulic pressure

51:15.080 --> 51:16.560
 towards aggressive states.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.700
 If cortisol levels are reduced,

51:18.700 --> 51:21.800
 well, then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.080
 This is supported by a number of peer-reviewed studies.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.360
 We'll provide links to some of those

51:25.360 --> 51:26.680
 in the caption show notes.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.880
 And we're going to return to these a bit later

51:28.880 --> 51:30.680
 in the context of specific studies

51:30.680 --> 51:34.000
 that have looked at genetic variants

51:34.000 --> 51:36.040
 in different individuals that cause them

51:36.040 --> 51:38.120
 to make more or less serotonin,

51:38.120 --> 51:40.620
 or at least to metabolize serotonin differently.

51:40.620 --> 51:42.720
 This is also the case for so-called

51:42.720 --> 51:44.960
 intermittent explosive disorder

51:44.960 --> 51:49.080
 that can often be associated with gene variants

51:49.080 --> 51:52.360
 that control how much serotonin is made

51:52.360 --> 51:54.560
 or how it's metabolized or how much cortisol is made

51:54.560 --> 51:56.440
 and how much it's metabolized.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.460
 In thinking about tools,

51:57.460 --> 51:59.160
 there are a number of things that one could consider.

51:59.160 --> 52:03.000
 First of all, there are a number of decent studies

52:03.000 --> 52:06.600
 exploring how supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids,

52:06.600 --> 52:11.600
 which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems,

52:11.640 --> 52:14.520
 including serotonin, that can modulate,

52:14.520 --> 52:18.840
 not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.320
 Supplementation with the omega-3s

52:20.320 --> 52:23.260
 has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness

52:23.260 --> 52:26.520
 in certain contexts, in things like ADHD

52:26.520 --> 52:29.160
 or in individuals who have a predisposition

52:29.160 --> 52:32.380
 for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking.

52:32.380 --> 52:34.240
 Now, that doesn't necessarily mean

52:34.240 --> 52:37.160
 that the omega-3 fatty acids are going directly

52:37.160 --> 52:38.560
 to the ventromedial hypothalamus

52:38.560 --> 52:40.480
 and changing the activity of neurons there.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.320
 More likely, they are causing or modulating

52:43.320 --> 52:47.600
 an overall shift in mood through the immune system,

52:47.600 --> 52:51.880
 through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone

52:51.880 --> 52:53.600
 or the propensity for neurons

52:53.600 --> 52:56.880
 in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated.

52:56.880 --> 52:59.040
 How much omega-3 fatty acid, what source?

52:59.040 --> 53:01.440
 Well, we've talked about this on the podcast before.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.300
 You can, of course, get omega-3 fatty acids

53:03.300 --> 53:04.440
 from a number of different foods.

53:04.440 --> 53:05.720
 Getting them from whole foods

53:05.720 --> 53:07.480
 is probably the best way to do it.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.060
 But many people, including people with depression,

53:10.060 --> 53:12.600
 will often supplement with one gram or more

53:12.600 --> 53:14.520
 of omega-3 fatty acids per day.

53:14.520 --> 53:17.960
 Some people, including myself, will take them every day

53:17.960 --> 53:20.060
 as just a general mood enhancer.

53:20.060 --> 53:21.240
 I don't suffer from depression,

53:21.240 --> 53:24.400
 but I've found it to be beneficial for my health.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.760
 And so some people will do that.

53:25.760 --> 53:26.740
 And I've talked about before

53:26.740 --> 53:28.860
 how in double-blind placebo-controlled studies,

53:28.860 --> 53:31.760
 people taking one to three grams of omega-3 fatty acids

53:31.760 --> 53:34.000
 per day, typically in the form of a high-quality fish oil,

53:34.000 --> 53:35.800
 although there are other sources as well,

53:35.800 --> 53:36.840
 algae and so forth,

53:38.120 --> 53:40.460
 can experience improvements in mood

53:40.460 --> 53:43.000
 that are on par with some of the SSRIs,

53:43.000 --> 53:44.920
 the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.740
 And of course, if you are prescribed an SSRI

53:46.740 --> 53:48.240
 by your psychiatrist or other doctor,

53:48.240 --> 53:50.620
 please do take that and don't cease to take it,

53:50.620 --> 53:52.320
 just simply to take omega-3s.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.860
 However, you might mention to them,

53:54.860 --> 53:56.400
 and you can find links to the studies

53:56.400 --> 53:58.400
 in our previous episodes on depression,

53:58.400 --> 54:02.080
 that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids

54:02.080 --> 54:05.080
 at this one gram or more of EPA specifically,

54:05.080 --> 54:06.820
 so getting above that one gram threshold

54:06.820 --> 54:10.920
 as high as three grams per day of the EPA

54:10.920 --> 54:14.520
 has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs

54:14.520 --> 54:16.480
 and still keep their mood in a place

54:16.480 --> 54:18.160
 that's beneficial for them.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.600
 And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range

54:20.600 --> 54:22.560
 that's healthy and doesn't bias someone

54:22.560 --> 54:25.940
 toward high levels of aggression and irritability,

54:25.940 --> 54:28.780
 that's again going to be set

54:28.780 --> 54:32.140
 by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues.

54:32.140 --> 54:33.780
 And I've talked about some of those on the podcast,

54:33.780 --> 54:35.940
 but I'll just briefly recap them now.

54:35.940 --> 54:39.000
 Obviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day

54:39.000 --> 54:42.080
 and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes

54:42.080 --> 54:44.100
 throughout the day is going to be important.

54:44.100 --> 54:48.460
 Again, because of this effect of estrogen in long days,

54:48.460 --> 54:50.540
 not increasing aggression.

54:50.540 --> 54:53.500
 However, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression

54:53.500 --> 54:57.780
 because of the increase in cortisol observed in short days.

54:57.780 --> 55:00.660
 Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed

55:00.660 --> 55:03.780
 in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat,

55:03.780 --> 55:04.820
 but also hot baths.

55:04.820 --> 55:07.380
 It turns out that hot baths and sauna

55:07.380 --> 55:09.580
 can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol.

55:09.580 --> 55:10.980
 All the details on that are included

55:10.980 --> 55:12.620
 in the episode on heat and its timestamp,

55:12.620 --> 55:14.100
 so you can go directly to that

55:14.100 --> 55:15.540
 if you want to learn about the temperatures

55:15.540 --> 55:16.660
 and the various durations,

55:16.660 --> 55:20.340
 but to just give a synopsis of that,

55:20.340 --> 55:25.340
 a 20 minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius

55:26.900 --> 55:29.900
 is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol.

55:29.900 --> 55:31.300
 If you don't have access to a sauna,

55:31.300 --> 55:33.100
 you could do a hot bath,

55:33.100 --> 55:34.820
 adjust the temperature so you don't burn yourself.

55:34.820 --> 55:37.460
 I think 80 to 100 degrees Celsius is going to be too hot

55:37.460 --> 55:39.140
 for many people if it's a hot bath,

55:39.140 --> 55:42.180
 whereas many people who can't tolerate that hot bath

55:42.180 --> 55:43.180
 can tolerate the sauna.

55:43.180 --> 55:46.020
 So safety first, always, and of course,

55:46.020 --> 55:49.420
 but hot baths reduce cortisol.

55:49.420 --> 55:52.260
 Hot saunas reduce cortisol of a duration

55:52.260 --> 55:54.420
 about 20 or 30 minutes is going to be beneficial.

55:54.420 --> 55:56.060
 And of course, some of you may be interested

55:56.060 --> 55:57.500
 in exploring the supplementation route

55:57.500 --> 55:59.700
 and for reductions in cortisol,

55:59.700 --> 56:03.180
 really the chief player there is ashwagandha,

56:03.180 --> 56:06.820
 which is known to decrease cortisol fairly potently.

56:06.820 --> 56:08.540
 I should just warn you that if you're going to use

56:08.540 --> 56:11.300
 ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol,

56:11.300 --> 56:13.820
 first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider

56:13.820 --> 56:15.540
 before adding or subtracting anything

56:15.540 --> 56:17.380
 from your supplementation or health regimen.

56:17.380 --> 56:18.980
 Of course, I don't just say that to protect us.

56:18.980 --> 56:20.140
 I say that to protect you.

56:20.140 --> 56:22.100
 You are responsible for your health,

56:22.100 --> 56:24.020
 what you take and what you don't take.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.100
 Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha

56:27.100 --> 56:30.300
 can have some not so great effects of disruption

56:30.300 --> 56:33.060
 of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways.

56:33.060 --> 56:36.540
 So the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use

56:36.540 --> 56:39.300
 before you'd want to take a break of about two weeks.

56:39.300 --> 56:42.940
 So ashwagandha, again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol,

56:42.940 --> 56:45.340
 but with some other effects as well,

56:45.340 --> 56:47.380
 don't use it chronically for longer than two weeks.

56:47.380 --> 56:49.460
 But if your goal is to reduce cortisol,

56:49.460 --> 56:50.580
 let's say you're going through a period

56:50.580 --> 56:53.700
 of increased irritability and aggressive tendency,

56:53.700 --> 56:55.420
 maybe you're also not getting as much light

56:55.420 --> 56:57.340
 as you would like, and perhaps also

56:57.340 --> 57:00.020
 if there are other circumstantial things

57:00.020 --> 57:01.400
 leading you towards more aggressiveness

57:01.400 --> 57:03.340
 and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,

57:03.340 --> 57:05.180
 that can be potentially helpful.

57:05.180 --> 57:07.900
 And in light of all this stuff about cortisol

57:07.900 --> 57:10.900
 and estrogen and day length,

57:10.900 --> 57:13.700
 I should mention that there are in fact some people

57:13.700 --> 57:16.220
 who have a genetic predisposition

57:16.220 --> 57:19.860
 to be more irritable and aggressive.

57:19.860 --> 57:21.900
 There are a couple of different gene pathways

57:21.900 --> 57:23.100
 associated with this.

57:23.100 --> 57:25.340
 We never like to think about just one gene

57:25.340 --> 57:27.540
 causing a specific behavior.

57:27.540 --> 57:30.620
 The way to think about genes is that genes generally code

57:30.620 --> 57:33.620
 for things within our biology,

57:33.620 --> 57:35.060
 in the context of today's discussion,

57:35.060 --> 57:36.860
 things like neural circuits

57:36.860 --> 57:39.260
 or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made

57:39.260 --> 57:40.740
 or the amounts of hormones that are made

57:40.740 --> 57:43.320
 or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors

57:43.320 --> 57:45.280
 or enzymes, et cetera,

57:45.280 --> 57:48.540
 that shift the activity of our biology

57:48.540 --> 57:51.620
 in a particular direction, they bias our biology.

57:51.620 --> 57:55.320
 And in fact, there is a genetic variant

57:55.320 --> 57:58.140
 present in certain people

57:58.140 --> 58:01.300
 that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity

58:02.180 --> 58:05.100
 and that estrogen receptor sensitivity

58:05.100 --> 58:08.340
 can result in increased levels of aggression,

58:08.340 --> 58:10.300
 sometimes dramatic increases.

58:10.300 --> 58:13.180
 However, and also very interestingly,

58:13.180 --> 58:15.860
 photoperiod, meaning day length,

58:15.860 --> 58:18.820
 is a strong modulator of whether or not

58:18.820 --> 58:20.920
 that aggressiveness turns up or not.

58:20.920 --> 58:25.080
 Whether or not that person with the particular gene variant

58:25.080 --> 58:28.700
 is more aggressive or not depends on how long the day is

58:28.700 --> 58:30.300
 and how long the night is.

58:30.300 --> 58:33.060
 One particular study that I like that references this

58:33.060 --> 58:35.680
 is Trainor et al, the title of the study is

58:35.680 --> 58:38.180
 photoperiod reverses the effects of estrogens

58:38.180 --> 58:41.660
 on male aggression via genomic and non-genomic pathways.

58:41.660 --> 58:43.500
 This was a paper published in the Proceedings

58:43.500 --> 58:45.340
 of the National Academy of Sciences.

58:45.340 --> 58:47.520
 We'll put a reference to this in the show notes

58:47.520 --> 58:49.220
 if you'd like to explore it further.

58:49.220 --> 58:51.860
 But it really points to the fact that rarely,

58:52.720 --> 58:55.300
 sometimes, but rarely is it the case

58:55.300 --> 58:57.860
 that just one gene will cause somebody

58:57.860 --> 58:59.200
 to be hyper aggressive.

59:00.300 --> 59:02.260
 Almost always, there's going to be an interplay

59:02.260 --> 59:04.080
 between genetics and environment

59:04.080 --> 59:07.080
 and as environment changes, such as day length changes

59:07.080 --> 59:08.520
 and the length of night changes,

59:08.520 --> 59:11.660
 so too will the tendency for people with a given

59:11.660 --> 59:14.620
 genetic variant to be more aggressive or not.

59:14.620 --> 59:17.340
 Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing

59:17.340 --> 59:19.460
 for this particular estrogen receptor variant,

59:19.460 --> 59:21.140
 most people, I'm guessing you,

59:21.140 --> 59:22.540
 are probably not walking around knowing

59:22.540 --> 59:24.900
 that you have this gene or not.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.820
 Regardless, I think it's important to pay attention

59:28.820 --> 59:31.140
 to how you feel at different times of year,

59:31.140 --> 59:33.040
 depending on whether or not it's summer,

59:33.040 --> 59:33.880
 whether or not it's winter,

59:33.880 --> 59:36.200
 whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight,

59:36.200 --> 59:38.140
 meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not,

59:38.140 --> 59:40.180
 whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight exposure

59:40.180 --> 59:41.320
 to your skin or not,

59:41.320 --> 59:42.940
 whether or not you're indoors all the time.

59:42.940 --> 59:46.320
 Generally, those things correlate with season,

59:46.320 --> 59:47.580
 but not always.

59:47.580 --> 59:50.280
 You can go through long bouts of hard work

59:50.280 --> 59:51.940
 in the summer months when days are long,

59:51.940 --> 59:53.640
 but you're indoors a lot and getting a lot

59:53.640 --> 59:55.460
 of fluorescent light exposure late in the evening,

59:55.460 --> 59:57.700
 and perhaps that's when you're feeling more aggressive.

59:57.700 --> 59:58.940
 So we have to be careful about drawing

59:58.940 --> 1:00:02.500
 a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.940
 and certainly psychological or behavioral feature

1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:07.420
 like aggressiveness, but it's, I believe,

1:00:07.420 --> 1:00:11.020
 helpful to know that these genetic biases exist,

1:00:11.020 --> 1:00:11.980
 how they play out.

1:00:11.980 --> 1:00:13.380
 Again, they shift our biology

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:16.660
 in a general thematic direction.

1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:17.740
 They don't change one thing.

1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:20.020
 They change a variety of things that bias us toward

1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:23.100
 or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes

1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:25.700
 and the various things that we can do

1:00:25.700 --> 1:00:27.300
 in order to offset them.

1:00:27.300 --> 1:00:28.900
 We described those earlier in terms of trying

1:00:28.900 --> 1:00:31.100
 to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight

1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:34.180
 regardless of time of year and regardless of whether

1:00:34.180 --> 1:00:36.680
 or not you happen to have this particular genetic variant.

1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:39.740
 So earlier I talked about how it is testosterone converted

1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:42.180
 into estrogen that's activating aggression

1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:45.520
 in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself.

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:48.520
 However, there are some studies carried out in humans

1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:51.340
 that have evaluated the effects of testosterone

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:53.660
 and how levels of testosterone correlate

1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:56.180
 with aggressiveness in the short term.

1:00:56.180 --> 1:00:57.960
 I'm just going to detail a few of those studies

1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:00.980
 because I think they are interesting and important.

1:01:02.460 --> 1:01:05.660
 First of all, there is a study that has explored levels

1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:09.020
 of testosterone in men of different professions.

1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:10.460
 Now, before I tell you the data,

1:01:10.460 --> 1:01:12.160
 I want to be very clear here.

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:15.940
 With a study such as this, one never knows whether

1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:19.180
 or not these men went into a particular profession

1:01:19.180 --> 1:01:23.980
 because they had a testosterone level of a given value

1:01:23.980 --> 1:01:27.420
 or whether or not the work itself altered

1:01:27.420 --> 1:01:30.300
 their testosterone levels or both.

1:01:30.300 --> 1:01:34.320
 And I think it's fair to assume that it's probably both.

1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:36.020
 So be very careful in assuming

1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:39.980
 that a given testosterone level is causal

1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:41.380
 for choosing a particular career

1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:43.420
 or that a particular career is causal

1:01:43.420 --> 1:01:46.260
 for creating a particular testosterone level.

1:01:46.260 --> 1:01:49.460
 This study used salivary testosterone levels

1:01:49.460 --> 1:01:52.100
 as the measure, which to be fair,

1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:55.260
 is not the best way to measure testosterone.

1:01:55.260 --> 1:01:57.180
 Typically blood draw would be the best way

1:01:57.180 --> 1:01:59.460
 to measure testosterone, but nonetheless,

1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:01.760
 provided the appropriate methods are used,

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:04.060
 salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure

1:02:04.060 --> 1:02:05.820
 of testosterone.

1:02:05.820 --> 1:02:09.700
 The different occupations that were looked at were,

1:02:09.700 --> 1:02:12.440
 and here they just looked at men in this particular study,

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:14.540
 were ministers, salesmen,

1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:16.300
 they didn't say what particular types of salesmen,

1:02:16.300 --> 1:02:19.420
 firemen, professors of all things,

1:02:19.420 --> 1:02:21.740
 physicians and NFL players.

1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:26.300
 And what they discovered was that the testosterone levels

1:02:26.300 --> 1:02:29.380
 were essentially in that order from low to highest.

1:02:29.380 --> 1:02:31.700
 So minister, salesman, fireman, professor,

1:02:31.700 --> 1:02:34.000
 physician, NFL player.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.500
 Now we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:41.300
 and all the different features of each of these jobs.

1:02:41.300 --> 1:02:44.280
 For instance, we don't know whether or not the fact

1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:47.140
 that the fireman happened, at least in this study,

1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:49.660
 to have lower testosterone levels on average

1:02:49.660 --> 1:02:51.600
 than the professors or the physicians

1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:54.020
 was because firemen have lower testosterone levels

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:55.960
 or because they have a much more stressful job

1:02:55.960 --> 1:02:58.260
 and their cortisol levels are higher

1:02:58.260 --> 1:03:01.120
 than the professor or the physician

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:03.480
 and cortisol and testosterone, not always,

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:07.680
 but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:09.740
 because they derive from the same precursor, et cetera.

1:03:09.740 --> 1:03:12.180
 Typically when cortisol is high,

1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:14.460
 testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa.

1:03:14.460 --> 1:03:17.180
 So we don't know what's causing these effects.

1:03:17.180 --> 1:03:21.200
 And again, this is just one study and just six occupations,

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:22.600
 but I think it's relatively interesting

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:24.200
 given the fact that each of these professions

1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.380
 involves different levels of competitiveness, right?

1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:29.620
 So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level

1:03:29.620 --> 1:03:32.500
 of physical exertion that's required,

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:34.280
 but also the level of competitiveness

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.740
 because it's known that competitive interactions

1:03:36.740 --> 1:03:39.160
 can cause increases in testosterone,

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:42.900
 in particular in the winners of competitive interactions,

1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:45.260
 a topic for a future podcast.

1:03:45.260 --> 1:03:48.380
 Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed

1:03:48.380 --> 1:03:53.100
 also again salivary testosterone in prisoners,

1:03:53.100 --> 1:03:55.340
 in this case, female prisoners,

1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:57.400
 so these are incarcerated individuals,

1:03:57.400 --> 1:03:59.740
 have looked at levels of testosterone

1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:02.620
 according to whether or not the person committed

1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:04.720
 a nonviolent or a violent crime

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:06.300
 in order to arrive in prison,

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:08.940
 and higher levels of salivary testosterone

1:04:08.940 --> 1:04:13.780
 were related to those that had arrived in prison

1:04:13.780 --> 1:04:16.740
 because of conviction of a violent crime

1:04:16.740 --> 1:04:18.580
 as opposed to a nonviolent crime.

1:04:18.580 --> 1:04:21.780
 Likewise, when they analyze prison rule violations,

1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:24.260
 so an indirect measure of aggressiveness,

1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:26.660
 but in this case, it was strongly associated

1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:27.700
 with aggressiveness because they knew

1:04:27.700 --> 1:04:29.260
 what the violations were,

1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:32.060
 they found were for prisoners that had none,

1:04:32.060 --> 1:04:35.460
 no prison violations, prison rule violations,

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:39.520
 I should say their testosterone levels tended to be lower

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:42.860
 than the testosterone levels of women that had some,

1:04:42.860 --> 1:04:47.860
 even one or more aggressive violations of prison rules.

1:04:48.020 --> 1:04:51.440
 We'll provide links to these studies in the show notes

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:53.480
 if you'd like to go into them further.

1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:55.340
 Obviously studies like this need to be taken

1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:57.700
 with a grain of salt because there are so many

1:04:57.700 --> 1:05:00.940
 different factors, different prisons have different degrees

1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:05.460
 of violence to begin with and competitiveness to begin with.

1:05:05.460 --> 1:05:07.980
 But just as a final pass at examining the role

1:05:07.980 --> 1:05:10.380
 between testosterone and aggressiveness,

1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:13.580
 there was a very interesting study from Gotz et al.

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:18.580
 G-O-E-T-Z published in 2014 that looked at serum,

1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:22.380
 so in this case, blood levels of testosterone,

1:05:22.380 --> 1:05:26.620
 30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone

1:05:26.620 --> 1:05:28.780
 that goes transdermal so that the testosterone

1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:30.500
 can go very quickly into the bloodstream

1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:34.820
 and then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity

1:05:34.820 --> 1:05:38.860
 of neurons in the so-called corticomedial amygdala.

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:41.540
 The medial amygdala is one of the areas

1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:44.460
 of the amygdala complex as we call it because it's complex,

1:05:44.460 --> 1:05:46.220
 it's got a lot of different nuclei,

1:05:46.220 --> 1:05:48.260
 you now know what nuclei are, little clusters of neurons,

1:05:48.260 --> 1:05:49.240
 it's got a lot of different ones,

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:52.980
 but that medial and that corticomedial amygdala

1:05:52.980 --> 1:05:55.300
 in particular is known to be associated

1:05:55.300 --> 1:05:57.260
 with aggressive type behaviors.

1:05:57.260 --> 1:05:59.980
 It's linked up with, it's part of the larger circuit

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:02.760
 that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus

1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:04.540
 and other brain areas that we referred to earlier,

1:06:04.540 --> 1:06:05.880
 such as the PAG.

1:06:07.340 --> 1:06:10.260
 What is remarkable about this study is that it showed

1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:13.120
 that just 30 minutes after application

1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:14.380
 of this so-called androgel,

1:06:14.380 --> 1:06:16.980
 this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream,

1:06:16.980 --> 1:06:20.080
 there was a significant increase in, of course,

1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:25.080
 testosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation.

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:27.900
 So testosterone can have acute effects,

1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:31.220
 immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression.

1:06:31.220 --> 1:06:33.620
 And I think this is something that's not often discussed

1:06:33.620 --> 1:06:36.280
 because many of the effects of steroid hormones

1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:38.640
 like testosterone and estrogen are very slow acting.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:40.300
 In fact, steroid hormones,

1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:43.900
 because they have a certain biochemical composition,

1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:46.260
 can actually pass through the membranes of cells,

1:06:46.260 --> 1:06:48.660
 so the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell

1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:50.700
 and change gene expression in the cell.

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:53.020
 Think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer

1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:55.120
 and then comes back looking completely different.

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:57.240
 Well, that's because a lot of genes got turned on

1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:00.700
 by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen,

1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:02.580
 but the steroid hormones can also have

1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:05.020
 very fast acting effects.

1:07:05.020 --> 1:07:06.780
 And with testosterone in particular,

1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:08.880
 those can be remarkably fast acting.

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:10.700
 And one of the most apparent

1:07:10.700 --> 1:07:13.180
 and well-documented fast acting effects is this effect,

1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:16.200
 the ability to activate cells within the amygdala.

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:17.040
 So you might say, well,

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:18.760
 I thought the amygdala was associated with fear,

1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:20.340
 wouldn't testosterone then cause fear?

1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:25.020
 No, turns out that the amygdala harbors both cortisol,

1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:27.840
 corticosterone receptors, and testosterone receptors,

1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:29.840
 and they each adjust the activity

1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:31.640
 in the amygdala differently,

1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:36.140
 such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry

1:07:36.140 --> 1:07:40.080
 for inducing states of mind and body

1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:41.940
 that are more action-based.

1:07:41.940 --> 1:07:43.900
 And indeed in animals and in humans,

1:07:43.900 --> 1:07:45.840
 testosterone application and activation

1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:47.780
 of this corticomedial amygdala pathway

1:07:47.780 --> 1:07:50.100
 will make animals and humans lean into effort.

1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:52.500
 This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good,

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:54.640
 or at least biases the organism

1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:56.340
 toward leaning into challenge.

1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:59.660
 So if you recall, there's not just one type of aggression,

1:07:59.660 --> 1:08:01.660
 there's reactive aggression,

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:04.500
 which is triggered when one is confronted with something

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:06.580
 that sometimes is inevitable, right?

1:08:06.580 --> 1:08:07.940
 One needs to fight for their life

1:08:07.940 --> 1:08:09.540
 or for somebody else's life,

1:08:09.540 --> 1:08:12.340
 but also proactive aggression.

1:08:12.340 --> 1:08:14.780
 And proactive aggression involves activation

1:08:14.780 --> 1:08:17.100
 of those go pathways in the basal ganglia

1:08:17.100 --> 1:08:19.100
 and a leaning into effort to overcome

1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:22.020
 whatever state one happens to be in to begin with.

1:08:22.020 --> 1:08:24.560
 And so this is very important because it points to the fact

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:27.560
 that yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:30.580
 that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,

1:08:30.580 --> 1:08:32.300
 but it's very likely the case

1:08:32.300 --> 1:08:35.180
 that testosterone is acting to accelerate

1:08:35.180 --> 1:08:38.100
 or to bias states of mind and body

1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:40.540
 toward those that will lead to aggression.

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:43.140
 Again, aggression is not like a switch on and off,

1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:46.620
 it's a process, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

1:08:46.620 --> 1:08:48.300
 Remember that hydraulic pressure

1:08:48.300 --> 1:08:50.940
 that Konrad Lorenz hypothesized?

1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:55.460
 Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure

1:08:55.460 --> 1:08:57.420
 toward an aggressive episode

1:08:57.420 --> 1:08:59.580
 and then estrogen actually triggering

1:08:59.580 --> 1:09:02.400
 that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus.

1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:04.980
 So if somebody tells you that testosterone,

1:09:04.980 --> 1:09:07.780
 endogenous or exogenous, makes people aggressive,

1:09:07.780 --> 1:09:08.980
 tell them no.

1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:13.100
 Testosterone tends to make people lean into effort

1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:16.340
 and if that effort involves being aggressive,

1:09:16.340 --> 1:09:20.280
 either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive,

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:22.660
 well, then it will indeed lead to aggression,

1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:25.180
 but the actual aggression itself

1:09:25.180 --> 1:09:28.380
 is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone.

1:09:28.380 --> 1:09:30.580
 Now, thus far, we really haven't talked too much

1:09:30.580 --> 1:09:34.660
 about the social context in which aggression occurs

1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:36.500
 and that's because there is a near infinite,

1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:40.340
 if not infinite number of variables that will determine that.

1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:44.220
 So for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate

1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:46.100
 at a professional boxing match

1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:48.300
 provided it's occurring inside the ring

1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:50.220
 and only between the competitors

1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:55.220
 and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera.

1:09:55.740 --> 1:09:58.140
 However, there are some things

1:09:58.140 --> 1:10:01.020
 that tend to bias certain social contexts

1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:03.200
 toward being more aggressive or less aggressive

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:05.460
 and not always physical aggression

1:10:05.460 --> 1:10:08.260
 and those generally come in two forms

1:10:08.260 --> 1:10:09.560
 that many of you are familiar with,

1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:12.820
 which are alcohol and caffeine.

1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:15.020
 Let's discuss caffeine first.

1:10:15.020 --> 1:10:18.300
 Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity?

1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:20.380
 Well, the general effects of caffeine

1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:22.180
 are to increase autonomic arousal,

1:10:22.180 --> 1:10:25.100
 the activity of the so-called sympathetic arm

1:10:25.100 --> 1:10:26.840
 of the autonomic nervous system,

1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:30.660
 which is, to put it very much in plain language,

1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:34.380
 it's the alertness arm of your nervous system.

1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:37.100
 That is, it creates a sense of readiness

1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:38.420
 in your brain and body

1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:40.000
 and it does so by activating

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.860
 the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.

1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:43.260
 Again, as I always remind people,

1:10:43.260 --> 1:10:46.660
 simpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy.

1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:49.660
 Simpa means together or all at once

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:54.180
 and caffeine tends to bias our brain and body

1:10:54.180 --> 1:10:57.320
 to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,

1:10:57.320 --> 1:10:59.500
 which run from about the base of your neck

1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:01.160
 until the top of your pelvis

1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:03.280
 and deploy a bunch of chemicals

1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:04.860
 that jut out into the rest of your body,

1:11:04.860 --> 1:11:06.580
 activate adrenaline release.

1:11:06.580 --> 1:11:10.140
 There's a parallel increase of adrenaline in your brain,

1:11:10.140 --> 1:11:12.500
 creating the state of alertness and readiness.

1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:13.900
 That state of alertness and readiness

1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.900
 can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression.

1:11:16.900 --> 1:11:19.100
 However, when we are in a state

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:22.860
 of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert,

1:11:22.860 --> 1:11:25.200
 such as after drinking caffeine,

1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:28.400
 we will bias all those brain and body systems,

1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:30.280
 the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera,

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:34.360
 that exist toward action as opposed to inaction.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:37.840
 So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity.

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:39.020
 No surprise there.

1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:41.540
 On the opposite end of things,

1:11:41.540 --> 1:11:46.020
 alcohol tends to decrease activity

1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:48.260
 in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,

1:11:48.260 --> 1:11:50.020
 tends to make us feel less alert.

1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:52.580
 Now, initially it can create a state of alertness

1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:55.180
 because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain.

1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:58.040
 Our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular

1:11:58.040 --> 1:11:59.940
 has what's called top-down inhibition.

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:04.060
 It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect

1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:05.820
 on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus,

1:12:05.820 --> 1:12:08.020
 such as the ventromedial hypothalamus.

1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:10.100
 The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain

1:12:10.100 --> 1:12:12.440
 is able to rationalize and think clearly

1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:15.940
 and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathways,

1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:18.480
 telling you don't say that mean thing,

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:20.740
 don't do that violent thing, et cetera.

1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:23.920
 Alcohol initially tends to increase

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.760
 our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition,

1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:30.200
 not just in that forebrain circuit,

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:32.200
 but in other circuits, tends to make us more active.

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:34.020
 We tend to talk more than we normally would,

1:12:34.020 --> 1:12:35.660
 move more than we normally would,

1:12:35.660 --> 1:12:39.580
 but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative

1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:43.380
 by way of reducing activity in the forebrain,

1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:45.980
 releasing some of the deeper brain circuits

1:12:45.980 --> 1:12:47.540
 that are involved in impulsivity,

1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:51.120
 but also causing a somewhat sedative effect.

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:54.100
 And then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further,

1:12:54.100 --> 1:12:57.020
 people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera.

1:12:57.940 --> 1:12:59.900
 So what we've got with alcohol and caffeine

1:12:59.900 --> 1:13:01.940
 is we've got two opposite ends of the spectrum,

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:04.780
 caffeine increasing arousal and readiness

1:13:04.780 --> 1:13:06.540
 and the tendency for impulsivity,

1:13:06.540 --> 1:13:10.820
 and alcohol also increasing impulsivity,

1:13:10.820 --> 1:13:12.780
 but through a different mechanism.

1:13:14.660 --> 1:13:16.180
 A really interesting study,

1:13:16.180 --> 1:13:18.140
 and I should just mention that the title of the study

1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:20.900
 is caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use

1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:23.820
 and indirect aggression, the impact of self-regulation.

1:13:23.820 --> 1:13:25.940
 So the title is almost self-explanatory.

1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:27.700
 This was a paper published in the Journal

1:13:27.700 --> 1:13:30.260
 of Addictive Behavior in 2016,

1:13:30.260 --> 1:13:34.180
 examining how ingestion of alcohol

1:13:34.180 --> 1:13:38.020
 that's either caffeinated or non-caffeinated alcohol drinks

1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:40.860
 impacted what they call indirect aggression.

1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:42.760
 And just to remind you what indirect aggression is,

1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:44.820
 these are not physical acts of aggression,

1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:46.460
 these are verbal acts of aggression.

1:13:46.460 --> 1:13:50.660
 So embarrassing others or otherwise somehow

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:52.920
 trying to reduce the wellbeing of others

1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:56.060
 by saying certain things in particular in groups.

1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:58.700
 This study examined both males and females.

1:13:58.700 --> 1:14:02.180
 This was done by way of a college campus study.

1:14:02.180 --> 1:14:04.740
 Subjects were 18 to 47 years old.

1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:06.340
 I guess there's some older students on that campus,

1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:07.580
 or maybe they use some non-students,

1:14:07.580 --> 1:14:09.400
 but these days you've also got some students

1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:11.020
 that are in their 30s and 40s.

1:14:11.020 --> 1:14:15.200
 So they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included,

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:18.020
 fairly broad racial background as well,

1:14:18.020 --> 1:14:19.520
 included not at equal numbers,

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:22.220
 but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum

1:14:22.220 --> 1:14:23.740
 of people with different backgrounds.

1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:26.260
 They looked in particular at people

1:14:26.260 --> 1:14:29.020
 that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks

1:14:29.020 --> 1:14:32.620
 at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week.

1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:34.140
 Okay, again, this is a college campus,

1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:35.140
 not that I encourage that.

1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:38.340
 I'm one of these people that I've never really liked,

1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:40.440
 drugs or alcohol, and it's sort of fortunate in that way,

1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:43.700
 I can drink or not drink and tend to not drink.

1:14:43.700 --> 1:14:47.580
 But so to me, 9.18 drinks per week sounds like a lot,

1:14:47.580 --> 1:14:50.300
 but I know for some people that might actually be typical.

1:14:50.300 --> 1:14:52.620
 And then others who were drinking

1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:56.820
 at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week,

1:14:56.820 --> 1:14:59.960
 and those individuals end as high, I should say,

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:04.380
 as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week.

1:15:04.380 --> 1:15:05.480
 So this would be energy drinks

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:07.140
 combined typically with hard alcohol.

1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:10.840
 That's fairly commonly available in bars and so forth.

1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:14.460
 And some individuals drank as much as, goodness,

1:15:14.460 --> 1:15:18.680
 20.36 alcoholic drinks per week total,

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:21.640
 some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated.

1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:23.540
 The basic outcome of this study

1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:26.740
 was that the more alcohol someone tended to consume,

1:15:26.740 --> 1:15:28.540
 the more likely it was that they would engage

1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:31.820
 in these indirect aggressive type behaviors.

1:15:31.820 --> 1:15:34.520
 And in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages,

1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:36.160
 there the effect was especially interesting.

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:37.420
 Here I'm just going to paraphrase,

1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:39.780
 or I'll actually read from the study.

1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:43.200
 Quote, with regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use,

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:44.300
 our findings indicated

1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:46.900
 that heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use

1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:49.420
 was associated positively with indirect aggression

1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:51.880
 even after considering one's typical alcohol use

1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:53.900
 and dispositional aggression.

1:15:53.900 --> 1:15:57.460
 What this means is that even though alcohol

1:15:57.460 --> 1:15:59.460
 can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive,

1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:00.660
 and even though certain individuals

1:16:00.660 --> 1:16:03.740
 already have a disposition toward being more aggressive,

1:16:03.740 --> 1:16:06.600
 there was an effect that was independent,

1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:11.300
 meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition,

1:16:11.300 --> 1:16:13.480
 meaning if someone was consuming

1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:15.260
 caffeinated alcoholic beverages,

1:16:15.260 --> 1:16:18.100
 they had a particularly high likelihood

1:16:18.100 --> 1:16:21.380
 of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior.

1:16:21.380 --> 1:16:22.740
 Now, this makes perfect sense

1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:24.580
 in light of the model they propose,

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:26.980
 which is this self-regulation model

1:16:26.980 --> 1:16:29.580
 that basically self-regulation involves several things.

1:16:29.580 --> 1:16:32.060
 It involves engaging in certain behaviors

1:16:32.060 --> 1:16:33.420
 and suppressing other behaviors.

1:16:33.420 --> 1:16:36.200
 So as described before,

1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:40.100
 because alcohol tends to have a sedative,

1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:42.660
 suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system,

1:16:43.620 --> 1:16:45.340
 at least after the initial period,

1:16:45.340 --> 1:16:47.860
 it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood

1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:50.540
 that people will engage in any type of behavior,

1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:53.060
 whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal

1:16:53.060 --> 1:16:55.580
 and increase the likelihood that someone will engage

1:16:55.580 --> 1:16:58.940
 in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise.

1:16:58.940 --> 1:17:01.340
 So the combination of caffeine and alcohol

1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:03.740
 is really acting as a two-prong system

1:17:03.740 --> 1:17:06.300
 to bias people towards more impulsivity,

1:17:06.300 --> 1:17:07.820
 that is less self-regulation.

1:17:07.820 --> 1:17:10.940
 So it's really yanking your volitional control,

1:17:10.940 --> 1:17:14.280
 your ability to engage in prefrontal top-down inhibition

1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:15.460
 over your hypothalamus

1:17:15.460 --> 1:17:18.020
 from two distinct and specific circuits.

1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:19.660
 By now, you should be getting the impression

1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:22.300
 that self-regulation is a key feature

1:17:22.300 --> 1:17:25.420
 of whether or not somebody, maybe even you,

1:17:25.420 --> 1:17:27.260
 is going to engage in aggressive speech

1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:28.500
 or aggressive behavior.

1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:29.820
 And we've talked about a number of tools

1:17:29.820 --> 1:17:32.780
 that one can use to reduce the probability

1:17:32.780 --> 1:17:34.320
 that that will happen.

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:36.340
 I suppose if the context were appropriate,

1:17:36.340 --> 1:17:39.380
 you could even take those two recommendations

1:17:39.380 --> 1:17:41.900
 and just invert them and increase the likelihood

1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:43.460
 that aggressiveness would have happened.

1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:46.980
 But regardless, self-regulation is key.

1:17:46.980 --> 1:17:49.780
 And in light of that, I want to share with you a study

1:17:49.780 --> 1:17:51.740
 that's focused on kids,

1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:56.240
 but that has important ramifications for adults as well.

1:17:57.660 --> 1:18:00.060
 As you probably are already aware,

1:18:00.060 --> 1:18:01.980
 there are many kids out there that suffer

1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:04.580
 from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1:18:04.580 --> 1:18:05.620
 ADHD.

1:18:05.620 --> 1:18:07.340
 There are also many adults we are finding

1:18:07.340 --> 1:18:09.140
 that are suffering from ADHD.

1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:12.400
 And there's also an epidemic, I would say,

1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:13.940
 of people that are concerned about

1:18:13.940 --> 1:18:15.500
 whether or not they have ADHD.

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:18.620
 Now, whether or not they have true clinical ADHD or not

1:18:18.620 --> 1:18:19.500
 is not clear.

1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:22.840
 We did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD.

1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:24.500
 I would encourage you to check out that episode

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.820
 and some of the diagnostic criteria.

1:18:26.820 --> 1:18:28.020
 If you have the opportunity,

1:18:28.020 --> 1:18:30.340
 you can find that at hubermanlab.com.

1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:34.380
 As this study I'm about to share with you aptly points out,

1:18:34.380 --> 1:18:36.960
 there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD.

1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:40.580
 There's no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD.

1:18:40.580 --> 1:18:44.880
 Whether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance

1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:46.900
 on a number of different cognitive tests

1:18:46.900 --> 1:18:49.620
 and behavioral tests and self-report.

1:18:49.620 --> 1:18:52.260
 In any event, the study I'm about to share with you

1:18:52.260 --> 1:18:55.540
 explored how a particular pattern of supplementation

1:18:55.540 --> 1:19:00.220
 in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes

1:19:00.220 --> 1:19:03.460
 and impulsivity and increase self-regulation.

1:19:03.460 --> 1:19:06.340
 And the title of the study is efficacy of carnitine

1:19:06.340 --> 1:19:07.420
 in the treatment of children

1:19:07.420 --> 1:19:10.120
 with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.020
 even though they put carnitine in the title,

1:19:12.020 --> 1:19:13.620
 that what they focused on was

1:19:13.620 --> 1:19:17.040
 whether or not acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:19.660
 could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency

1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:21.280
 of these kids with ADHD.

1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:24.380
 And to make a long story short, indeed it did.

1:19:24.380 --> 1:19:25.880
 There was a very significant effect

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:28.000
 of acetyl-carnitine supplementation

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:32.780
 on improving some of the symptomology of ADHD.

1:19:33.700 --> 1:19:35.020
 A few details about this study

1:19:35.020 --> 1:19:36.660
 that might be relevant to you.

1:19:36.660 --> 1:19:38.820
 This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled

1:19:38.820 --> 1:19:40.560
 double crossover study.

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:42.620
 This was done as an outpatient study

1:19:42.620 --> 1:19:44.200
 so the kids weren't in a hospital.

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:45.500
 They were living out in the world.

1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:47.340
 This again was done on younger kids.

1:19:47.340 --> 1:19:49.780
 So this was six to 13-year-old kids

1:19:50.940 --> 1:19:53.460
 that were diagnosed with ADHD.

1:19:53.460 --> 1:19:58.460
 They received either acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo,

1:19:58.820 --> 1:20:02.640
 and they did all the good practice stuff

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:05.660
 that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo

1:20:05.660 --> 1:20:08.820
 and the acetyl-L-carnitine had similar look and taste.

1:20:08.820 --> 1:20:11.820
 It was consumed twice daily after meals.

1:20:11.820 --> 1:20:13.380
 Now she just mentioned that acetyl-L-carnitine

1:20:13.380 --> 1:20:16.200
 typically is taken in capsule form

1:20:16.200 --> 1:20:18.220
 or occasionally an injectable form here.

1:20:18.220 --> 1:20:19.700
 They were using this as a drink,

1:20:19.700 --> 1:20:21.460
 which is essentially the same as capsule form,

1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:23.920
 but the powder is just going directly into liquid.

1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:27.900
 And the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram.

1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:29.740
 So they're doing this according to the body weight

1:20:29.740 --> 1:20:34.300
 of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day.

1:20:34.300 --> 1:20:36.080
 The quantity of the medication was supplied.

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:37.860
 Here I'm reading for a period of eight weeks,

1:20:37.860 --> 1:20:38.700
 and every eight weeks,

1:20:38.700 --> 1:20:40.280
 a new quantity of medication was supplied.

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:43.340
 So basically this is a fairly long-term study

1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:48.220
 exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes

1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:50.740
 in week eight, 16, and 24.

1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:53.240
 They also looked at things

1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:54.820
 that you could only get through a blood draw.

1:20:54.820 --> 1:20:56.740
 So things like hemoglobin, hematocrit,

1:20:56.740 --> 1:20:58.840
 red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera.

1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:01.060
 These are kids, and even if it were adults,

1:21:01.060 --> 1:21:02.600
 they were quite appropriately examining

1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:03.980
 a lot of the physiological measures

1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:07.620
 that one would want to carry out to make sure,

1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:10.840
 first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing,

1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:11.900
 and indeed they confirm that,

1:21:11.900 --> 1:21:14.580
 but also that no negative effects

1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:16.220
 are showing up in the physiology

1:21:16.220 --> 1:21:17.900
 as well as the psychology of these kids.

1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:20.000
 So first I'll just tell you the basic outcome of the study,

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.760
 which was, here I'm paraphrasing,

1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:23.860
 given twice daily, carnitine appeared to be effective

1:21:23.860 --> 1:21:24.980
 in well-tolerated treatment

1:21:24.980 --> 1:21:26.980
 for a group of children with ADHD.

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:29.460
 They showed significant abnormal behavior

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:31.700
 compared to these other boys.

1:21:31.700 --> 1:21:35.100
 And now I'm moving to the table of results.

1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:36.680
 They showed significant reductions

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:38.960
 in their so-called total problem score.

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:41.120
 The total problem score is a well-established measure

1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:44.460
 of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.

1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:47.300
 And I should say adults with ADHD

1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:51.940
 has to do with challenges in social and learning environments

1:21:51.940 --> 1:21:56.060
 and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform.

1:21:56.060 --> 1:21:58.060
 Reductions in attentional problems overall,

1:21:58.060 --> 1:21:59.300
 reductions in delinquency,

1:21:59.300 --> 1:22:01.940
 and most important for sake of today's discussion,

1:22:01.940 --> 1:22:04.700
 significant reductions in aggressive behavior.

1:22:04.700 --> 1:22:07.020
 Now, what's especially nice about this study, I think,

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:09.380
 is that even though it's a relatively small number

1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:13.060
 of subjects and certainly it needs to be repeated

1:22:13.060 --> 1:22:16.020
 in other studies and other laboratories,

1:22:16.020 --> 1:22:18.820
 that they were able to confirm the shifts

1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:22.380
 in L-carnitine within the bloodstream of these kids.

1:22:22.380 --> 1:22:24.760
 That is, they were able to correlate the physiology

1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:27.020
 with the psychological changes.

1:22:27.020 --> 1:22:29.900
 In studies like this, and frankly, in all studies

1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:33.140
 of human pharmacology, you have to worry about effects

1:22:33.140 --> 1:22:35.560
 that show up, not just because of placebo effects,

1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:37.620
 but because of so-called off-target effects

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:41.340
 or related things totally independent of the drug

1:22:41.340 --> 1:22:42.340
 or the particular supplement

1:22:42.340 --> 1:22:43.840
 that you happen to be looking at.

1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:46.460
 To put it in the words of a great neuroscientist,

1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:48.680
 unfortunately, he passed away some years ago,

1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:50.100
 but he was a member of the National Academy,

1:22:50.100 --> 1:22:53.140
 extremely accomplished neuroscientist,

1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:54.540
 who once turned to me and said,

1:22:54.540 --> 1:22:57.180
 never forget, a drug is a substance

1:22:57.180 --> 1:22:59.820
 that when injected into an animal or a human being

1:23:00.780 --> 1:23:02.520
 creates a paper.

1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:06.580
 Meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug

1:23:06.580 --> 1:23:09.300
 or any supplement in most all conditions.

1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:12.100
 However, it is in cases such as this study

1:23:12.100 --> 1:23:15.480
 where you can quite convincingly see

1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:18.100
 that the particular feature of physiology

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.180
 that you expected to change actually changed,

1:23:21.180 --> 1:23:23.420
 and you see a psychological outcome

1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:26.060
 that you can gain much greater confidence

1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:28.820
 that the changes in delinquency,

1:23:28.820 --> 1:23:30.140
 in this case, reduced delinquency,

1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:33.140
 improved attention, reduced aggressiveness, and so forth,

1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:36.660
 was at least somehow related to the shift

1:23:36.660 --> 1:23:39.980
 in blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine

1:23:39.980 --> 1:23:41.700
 or acetyl-L-carnitine and carnitine

1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:43.300
 in the bloodstream of these children,

1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:44.860
 as opposed to something else,

1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:48.460
 like L-carnitine going and affecting some downstream target

1:23:48.460 --> 1:23:49.580
 that you have no knowledge of.

1:23:49.580 --> 1:23:52.060
 Now, of course, that's still entirely possible,

1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:54.700
 but I think studies such as these increase our confidence

1:23:54.700 --> 1:23:57.820
 that things like L-carnitine can be used

1:23:57.820 --> 1:23:59.320
 perhaps in concert with things

1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:01.180
 like omega-3 supplementation,

1:24:01.180 --> 1:24:04.460
 diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan

1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:06.880
 and therefore more serotonin,

1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:08.700
 obviously avoiding things like alcohol,

1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:10.960
 and as it appears from the study I just described,

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:13.080
 reducing one's intake

1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:16.780
 or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages.

1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:17.740
 Seems like it would be a good idea

1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:19.860
 if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness

1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:21.660
 to think about the hormone context

1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:25.420
 and whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone

1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:27.860
 and estrogen or lower testosterone and estrogen.

1:24:27.860 --> 1:24:29.360
 Maybe even thinking about the work environment,

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:30.900
 whether or not you are existing

1:24:30.900 --> 1:24:32.940
 in a particularly competitive work environment

1:24:32.940 --> 1:24:35.940
 and even day life, time of year,

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:37.860
 and whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight,

1:24:37.860 --> 1:24:39.220
 whether or not you're avoiding light

1:24:39.220 --> 1:24:40.660
 in the evening and so on.

1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:42.920
 So studies such as this I think are useful

1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:47.860
 because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever,

1:24:47.860 --> 1:24:51.300
 will there be one supplement or one nutritional change

1:24:51.300 --> 1:24:52.740
 or even one behavioral change

1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:55.140
 that's going to completely shift an individual

1:24:55.140 --> 1:24:57.240
 from being aggressive and impulsive,

1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:01.660
 but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens,

1:25:01.660 --> 1:25:04.300
 by paying attention to things like time of year

1:25:04.300 --> 1:25:06.380
 and work conditions and school conditions

1:25:06.380 --> 1:25:07.620
 and overall levels of stress

1:25:07.620 --> 1:25:11.540
 and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera,

1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:14.940
 that you can use behaviors, diet, and supplementation

1:25:14.940 --> 1:25:18.580
 as a way to shift that overall internal milieu

1:25:18.580 --> 1:25:22.020
 from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure,

1:25:22.020 --> 1:25:24.100
 as it's been called throughout the episode,

1:25:24.100 --> 1:25:26.400
 toward aggressive impulsivity

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:29.400
 and relax some of that hydraulic pressure

1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:31.820
 and reduce aggressive tendencies.

1:25:31.820 --> 1:25:34.480
 So once again, and frankly, as always,

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:38.340
 we've done a deep dive into the neurobiology

1:25:38.340 --> 1:25:40.300
 and the psychology of what I believe

1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:42.100
 to be an important feature of our lives,

1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:43.880
 in this case, aggression.

1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:46.260
 I want to point out that in a episode

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:47.580
 in the not too distant future,

1:25:47.580 --> 1:25:50.820
 I'm going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson

1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:52.300
 from Caltech University,

1:25:52.300 --> 1:25:56.980
 who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression.

1:25:56.980 --> 1:25:58.260
 In fact, he is the senior author

1:25:58.260 --> 1:25:59.980
 on many of the studies related

1:25:59.980 --> 1:26:02.880
 to the ventromedial hypothalamus that I discussed today.

1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:05.880
 Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course.

1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:07.920
 So hearing today's episode

1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:09.580
 will help you digest that information,

1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:12.340
 but we are also going to talk about other emotional states.

1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:14.220
 He is an expert, not just in aggression,

1:26:14.220 --> 1:26:16.100
 but in motivated states related to sex

1:26:16.100 --> 1:26:20.540
 and mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds,

1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:23.460
 and how those relate not just to biology and psychology,

1:26:23.460 --> 1:26:25.860
 but also certain forms of pathology,

1:26:25.860 --> 1:26:28.080
 things like PTSD and the relationship, for instance,

1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:31.480
 between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression,

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:34.520
 and many other important topics that I know many of you,

1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:36.360
 if not all of you, will be interested in.

1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:37.620
 In the meantime, I want to point you

1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:42.380
 to his recently released and wonderful book entitled

1:26:42.380 --> 1:26:44.980
 The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.

1:26:44.980 --> 1:26:48.740
 And again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech.

1:26:48.740 --> 1:26:50.420
 This is a wonderful book.

1:26:50.420 --> 1:26:53.860
 It serves as a tremendous introduction

1:26:53.860 --> 1:26:56.360
 to the history of the study of these areas,

1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.900
 the current science and discoveries being made

1:26:58.900 --> 1:27:01.300
 in these areas, all made accessible

1:27:01.300 --> 1:27:03.600
 to the scientist and non-scientist alike.

1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:05.860
 It's a very engaging read.

1:27:05.860 --> 1:27:09.180
 And so much so that even though he was gracious

1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:11.900
 in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy

1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:14.060
 to give to somebody who is a therapist,

1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:16.740
 and I've purchased another copy to give to a high school kid

1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:18.980
 that I mentor because he's very interested

1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:20.420
 in the neuroscience of emotions.

1:27:20.420 --> 1:27:23.020
 And I think we are all interested in emotions,

1:27:23.020 --> 1:27:25.780
 not just fear and some of these negative states,

1:27:25.780 --> 1:27:26.620
 not just aggression,

1:27:26.620 --> 1:27:28.780
 but also the positive emotions of our lives.

1:27:28.780 --> 1:27:31.800
 And so The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:34.140
 by David Anderson is a wonderful read.

1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:36.120
 I can't recommend it highly enough.

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:38.500

 slash Andrew Huberman, and there you can support

1:28:18.300 --> 1:28:20.620
 the podcast at any level that you like.

1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:22.980
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:25.880
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.

1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:28.220
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:30.620
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:28:30.620 --> 1:28:33.120
 for things like improving the transition time

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:35.140
 and the quality of your sleep

1:28:35.140 --> 1:28:38.540
 and improving alertness and focus and so on.

1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:40.620
 Anytime you're considering taking supplements,

1:28:40.620 --> 1:28:42.080
 there are several key considerations.

1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:43.300
 First of all, those supplements

1:28:43.300 --> 1:28:45.240
 should be of the very highest quality.

1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:47.800
 And you want to make sure that what's listed on the bottle

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:49.080
 is actually what's in the bottle,

1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:52.180
 which is a problem for many supplement companies out there.

1:28:52.180 --> 1:28:54.640
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce

1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:57.720
 that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements

1:28:57.720 --> 1:28:59.500
 because we believe Momentous Supplements

1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:01.520
 to be of the very highest quality

1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:03.380
 of any supplements out there.

1:29:03.380 --> 1:29:05.500
 And we've been working very closely with them

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:07.620
 in order to direct them to create supplements

1:29:07.620 --> 1:29:09.900
 that are individual ingredient supplements

1:29:09.900 --> 1:29:12.200
 of the particular quality and sources

1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:13.360
 that we would like to see

1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:15.780
 and that relate to the science and studies covered

1:29:15.780 --> 1:29:17.340
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:29:17.340 --> 1:29:19.020
 If you'd like to see some of those supplements,

1:29:19.020 --> 1:29:22.540
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

1:29:22.540 --> 1:29:24.980
 and there you will see some of the supplements

1:29:24.980 --> 1:29:26.860
 that we've talked about on this podcast before,

1:29:26.860 --> 1:29:30.460
 such as magnesium threonate for augmenting sleep,

1:29:30.460 --> 1:29:32.700
 things like L-tyrosine for augmenting dopamine,

1:29:32.700 --> 1:29:34.540
 and things like L-carnitine,

1:29:34.540 --> 1:29:36.840
 which we've discussed on today's podcast.

1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:38.660
 Right now, the list of supplements

1:29:38.660 --> 1:29:40.900
 and the products that are there is only partial

1:29:40.900 --> 1:29:42.580
 to what will soon be included in the future,

1:29:42.580 --> 1:29:45.100
 so that's an ever-expanding catalog of, again,

1:29:45.100 --> 1:29:47.520
 what we believe to be the very highest quality supplements

1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:48.620
 available to you.

1:29:48.620 --> 1:29:50.980
 For those of you that are interested in behavioral,

1:29:50.980 --> 1:29:53.880
 nutritional, and supplementation-based tools

1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:57.060
 for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology

1:29:57.060 --> 1:29:58.900
 that impact your health and performance,

1:29:58.900 --> 1:30:00.060
 we have a newsletter.

1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:02.180
 It is a zero-cost newsletter.

1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:03.900
 It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.

1:30:03.900 --> 1:30:07.320
 You can go to HubermanLab.com, and there in the menu,

1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:09.700
 you'll find the Neural Network Newsletter signup.

1:30:09.700 --> 1:30:11.160
 You can just put your email.

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:13.260
 We do not share your email with anybody else.

1:30:13.260 --> 1:30:16.100
 You will also find examples of the newsletter

1:30:16.100 --> 1:30:18.260
 that you can download right away without having to sign up

1:30:18.260 --> 1:30:20.260
 and decide if signing up is right for you.

1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:21.840
 And if you're not already following us

1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:23.380
 on Twitter and Instagram,

1:30:23.380 --> 1:30:27.080
 we are HubermanLab on both Instagram and Twitter,

1:30:27.080 --> 1:30:28.820
 and at both places,

1:30:28.820 --> 1:30:30.760
 I describe science and science-based tools,

1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:31.780
 some of which overlaps

1:30:31.780 --> 1:30:33.880
 with the content of the HubermanLab podcast,

1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:35.620
 but much of which is distinct

1:30:35.620 --> 1:30:38.200
 from the content of the HubermanLab podcast.

1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:39.660
 Once again, thank you for joining me

1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:42.460
 for our discussion about the biology, psychology,

1:30:42.460 --> 1:30:45.300
 and actionable tools around aggression,

1:30:45.300 --> 1:30:48.200
 and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:30:48.200 --> 1:31:06.700
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
