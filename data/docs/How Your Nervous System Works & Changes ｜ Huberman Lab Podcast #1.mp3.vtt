00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.640
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.640 --> 00:13.680
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.680 --> 00:15.620
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.620 --> 00:16.880
 For today's podcast,

00:16.880 --> 00:18.840
 we're going to talk about the parts list

00:18.840 --> 00:20.400
 of the nervous system.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.040
 Now that might sound boring,

00:22.040 --> 00:25.000
 but these are the bits and pieces that together

00:25.000 --> 00:28.320
 make up everything about your experience of life,

00:28.320 --> 00:30.520
 from what you think about to what you feel,

00:30.520 --> 00:32.580
 what you imagine, and what you accomplish

00:32.580 --> 00:35.680
 from the day you're born until the day you die.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.320
 That parts list is really incredible

00:38.320 --> 00:41.740
 because it has a history associated with it

00:41.740 --> 00:45.360
 that really provides a window into all sorts of things

00:45.360 --> 00:49.600
 like engineering, warfare, religion, and philosophy.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.940
 So I'm gonna share with you the parts list

00:51.940 --> 00:53.960
 that makes up who you are

00:53.960 --> 00:57.840
 through the lens of some of those other aspects of life

00:57.840 --> 01:01.340
 and other aspects of the history of the discovery

01:01.340 --> 01:03.080
 of the nervous system.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.520
 By the end of this podcast,

01:04.520 --> 01:06.440
 I promise you're gonna understand a lot more

01:06.440 --> 01:09.320
 about how you work and how to apply that knowledge.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.120
 There's gonna be a little bit of story.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.800
 There's gonna be a lot of discussion about the people

01:13.800 --> 01:16.360
 who made these particular discoveries.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.260
 There'll be a little bit of technical language.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.160
 There's no way to avoid that.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.460
 But at the end, you're gonna have in hand

01:22.460 --> 01:26.000
 what will be the equivalent of an entire semester

01:26.000 --> 01:30.020
 of learning about the nervous system and how you work.

01:30.020 --> 01:33.200
 So a few important points before we get started.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.900
 I am not a medical doctor.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.640
 That means I don't prescribe anything.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.920
 I'm a professor.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.700
 So sometimes I'll profess things.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.920
 In fact, I profess a lot of things.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.560
 We are going to talk about some basic functioning

01:44.560 --> 01:46.800
 of the nervous system, parts, et cetera.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.700
 But we're also gonna talk about how to apply that knowledge.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.600
 That said, your healthcare,

01:51.600 --> 01:53.420
 your wellbeing is your responsibility.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.260
 So anytime we talk about tools,

01:55.260 --> 01:57.880
 please filter it through that responsibility.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.260
 Talk to a healthcare professional

01:59.260 --> 02:02.000
 if you're gonna explore any new tools or practices.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.240
 And be smart in your pursuit of these new tools.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.200
 I also wanna emphasize that this podcast

02:09.200 --> 02:11.520
 and the other things I do on social media

02:11.520 --> 02:15.200
 are my personal goal of bringing zero cost

02:15.200 --> 02:18.120
 to consumer information to the general public.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.560
 It is separate from my role at Stanford University.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.120
 In that spirit, I really wanna thank the sponsors

02:24.120 --> 02:25.640
 of today's podcast.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.840
 The first one is Athletic Greens,

02:27.840 --> 02:30.340
 which is an all-in-one drink.

02:30.340 --> 02:33.160
 It's a greens drink that has vitamins, minerals,

02:33.160 --> 02:35.200
 probiotics, prebiotics.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.260
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012.

02:38.260 --> 02:41.160
 So I'm really delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.280
 The reason I like it is because

02:43.280 --> 02:44.520
 I like vitamins and minerals.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.480
 I think they're important to my health

02:46.480 --> 02:49.120
 and it can be kind of overwhelming to know

02:49.120 --> 02:51.280
 what to take in that landscape.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.240
 So by taking one thing that also happens to taste really

02:54.240 --> 02:57.160
 good, I get all the vitamins, minerals, et cetera

02:57.160 --> 02:57.980
 that I need.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.000
 There's also a lot of data out there now

03:00.000 --> 03:02.760
 about the importance of the gut microbiome

03:02.760 --> 03:05.860
 for immune health and for the gut brain access,

03:05.860 --> 03:07.080
 all these things.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.280
 And the probiotics and prebiotics are important to me

03:10.280 --> 03:11.480
 for that reason.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.080
 If you wanna try Athletic Greens,

03:13.080 --> 03:16.680
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:16.680 --> 03:19.240
 and put in the code word Huberman at checkout.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.760
 If you do that, they'll send you a year supply

03:21.760 --> 03:24.040
 of vitamin D3 and K2.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.480
 There's a lot in the news lately

03:25.480 --> 03:27.080
 about the importance of vitamin D3.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.400
 We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.840
 but many of us aren't getting enough sunlight.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.480
 Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevant

03:34.480 --> 03:37.760
 to the immune system and the hormone systems, et cetera.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.280
 So once again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

03:41.280 --> 03:43.920
 enter Huberman at checkout and you get the year supply

03:43.920 --> 03:47.680
 of D3 and K2 along with your Athletic Greens.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.320
 This podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker,

03:51.320 --> 03:53.820
 which is a health monitoring company.

03:53.820 --> 03:56.520
 It uses blood tests and saliva tests

03:56.520 --> 04:00.180
 to look at things like DNA and metabolic markers

04:00.180 --> 04:02.400
 and monitors your hormones,

04:02.400 --> 04:05.060
 a huge number of different parameters of health

04:05.060 --> 04:07.400
 that really can only be measured accurately

04:07.400 --> 04:09.500
 through blood and saliva tests.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.360
 I use Inside Tracker because I'm a big believer in data.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.320
 There's a lot of aspects to our biology

04:14.320 --> 04:16.740
 that can only be accurately measured

04:16.740 --> 04:19.400
 by way of blood test and saliva test.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.660
 The thing that's really nice about Inside Tracker

04:21.660 --> 04:24.320
 is that rather than just giving you a bunch of numbers back

04:24.320 --> 04:27.080
 of the levels of these things in your body,

04:27.080 --> 04:31.120
 it gives you through a really simple platform information

04:31.120 --> 04:34.200
 about what to do with all those levels of hormones

04:34.200 --> 04:36.440
 and metabolic markers, et cetera.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.620
 It also has a feature which is particularly interesting,

04:38.620 --> 04:40.640
 which it measures your inner age,

04:40.640 --> 04:43.240
 which is more a measure of your biological age

04:43.240 --> 04:45.400
 as opposed to your chronological age.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.520
 And all that information is organized

04:48.520 --> 04:51.460
 so that you can make changes in your nutritional regimes

04:51.460 --> 04:52.880
 or your exercise regimes

04:52.880 --> 04:55.900
 and watch how those markers change over time.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.360
 So if you wanna try Inside Tracker,

04:57.360 --> 05:00.680
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:00.680 --> 05:04.000
 and they'll give you 25% off at checkout.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.440
 So let's talk about the nervous system.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.680
 The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain

05:09.680 --> 05:13.020
 is because your brain is actually just one piece

05:13.020 --> 05:16.040
 of this larger, more important thing, frankly,

05:16.040 --> 05:17.840
 that we call the nervous system.

05:17.840 --> 05:21.900
 The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord,

05:21.900 --> 05:24.620
 but also all the connections between your brain

05:24.620 --> 05:27.520
 and your spinal cord and the organs of your body.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.200
 It also includes, very importantly,

05:30.200 --> 05:33.480
 all the connections between your organs

05:33.480 --> 05:35.520
 back to your spinal cord and brain.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.200
 So the way to think about how you function at every level

05:39.200 --> 05:42.060
 from the moment you're born until the day you die,

05:42.060 --> 05:45.880
 everything you think and remember and feel and imagine

05:45.880 --> 05:49.000
 is that your nervous system is this continuous loop

05:49.000 --> 05:52.280
 of communication between the brain, spinal cord and body

05:52.280 --> 05:54.200
 and body, spinal cord and brain.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.880
 In fact, we really can't even separate them.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.640
 It's one continuous loop.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.200
 You may have heard of something called a Mobius strip.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.800
 A Mobius strip is almost like one of these impossible figures

06:03.800 --> 06:06.080
 that no matter which angle you look at it from,

06:06.080 --> 06:08.160
 you can't tell where it starts and where it ends.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.440
 And that's really how your nervous system is built.

06:11.440 --> 06:16.120
 That's the structure that allows you to, for instance,

06:16.120 --> 06:18.720
 deploy immune cells, to release cells

06:18.720 --> 06:20.400
 that will go kill infection

06:20.400 --> 06:21.860
 when you're in the presence of infection.

06:21.860 --> 06:23.440
 Most people just think about that

06:23.440 --> 06:25.300
 as a function of the immune system,

06:25.300 --> 06:27.980
 but actually it's your nervous system

06:27.980 --> 06:31.680
 that tells organs like your spleen to release killer cells

06:31.680 --> 06:35.720
 that go and hunt down those bacterial and viral invaders

06:35.720 --> 06:37.600
 and gobble them up.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.520
 If you have a stomach ache, for instance,

06:39.520 --> 06:41.580
 sure, you feel that in your stomach,

06:41.580 --> 06:43.260
 but it's really your nervous system

06:43.260 --> 06:45.480
 that's causing the stomach ache.

06:45.480 --> 06:49.260
 The ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature.

06:49.260 --> 06:52.380
 So when we wanna talk about experience

06:52.380 --> 06:55.900
 or we wanna talk about how to change the self in any way,

06:55.900 --> 06:58.760
 we really need to think about the nervous system first.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.720
 It is fair to say that the nervous system

07:00.720 --> 07:04.280
 governs all other biological systems of the body

07:04.280 --> 07:08.360
 and it's also influenced by those other biological systems.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.880
 So if we're talking about the nervous system,

07:10.880 --> 07:13.200
 we need to get a little specific about what we mean.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.740
 It's not just this big loop of wires.

07:15.740 --> 07:18.440
 In fact, there's a interesting story about that

07:18.440 --> 07:22.400
 because at the turn of the sort of 1800s to 1900s,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.320
 it actually was believed that our nervous system

07:24.320 --> 07:26.520
 was just one giant cell.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.240
 But two guys, the names aren't super important,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.600
 but in fairness to their important discovery,

07:31.600 --> 07:35.360
 Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard, Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,

07:35.360 --> 07:39.000
 figured out how to label or stain the nervous system

07:39.000 --> 07:41.200
 in a way that revealed, oh my goodness,

07:41.200 --> 07:44.920
 we're actually made up of trillions of these little cells,

07:44.920 --> 07:47.040
 nerve cells that are called neurons.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.320
 And that's what a neuron is, it's just a nerve cell.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.120
 They also saw that those nerve cells

07:52.120 --> 07:53.580
 weren't touching one another.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.560
 They're actually separated by little gaps

07:55.560 --> 07:57.960
 and those little gaps you may have heard of before,

07:57.960 --> 07:59.860
 they're called synapses.

07:59.860 --> 08:03.140
 Those synapses are where the chemicals from one neuron

08:03.140 --> 08:05.280
 are kind of spit out or vomited into

08:05.280 --> 08:09.820
 and then the next nerve cell detects those chemicals

08:09.820 --> 08:12.360
 and then passes electricity down its length

08:12.360 --> 08:14.400
 to the next nerve cell and so forth.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.440
 So really the way to think about your body

08:17.440 --> 08:18.960
 and your thoughts and your mind

08:18.960 --> 08:21.640
 is that you are a flow of electricity, right?

08:21.640 --> 08:23.000
 There's nothing mystical about this.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.360
 You're a flow of electricity

08:24.360 --> 08:26.320
 between these different nerve cells

08:26.320 --> 08:28.560
 and depending on which nerve cells are active,

08:28.560 --> 08:30.920
 you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.100
 You might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red

08:34.100 --> 08:35.860
 or you might be seeing something and perceiving that

08:35.860 --> 08:38.780
 it's green all depending on which nerve cells

08:38.780 --> 08:41.680
 are electrically active at a given moment.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.320
 The example of perceiving red or perceiving green

08:44.320 --> 08:46.240
 is a particularly good example

08:46.240 --> 08:49.500
 because so often our experience of the world

08:49.500 --> 08:53.040
 makes it seem as if these things that are happening

08:53.040 --> 08:55.940
 outside us are actually happening inside us.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.280
 But the language of the nervous system is just electricity.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.680
 It's just like a Morse code of some sort

09:02.680 --> 09:05.480
 or the syllables and words and consonants

09:05.480 --> 09:06.520
 and vowels of language.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.000
 It just depends on how they're assembled, what order.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.420
 And so that brings us to the issue

09:11.420 --> 09:12.900
 of how the nervous system works.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.200
 The way to think about how the nervous system works

09:15.200 --> 09:18.980
 is that our experiences, our memories, everything

09:18.980 --> 09:21.480
 is sort of like the keys on a piano

09:21.480 --> 09:23.880
 being played in a particular order, right?

09:23.880 --> 09:26.500
 If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order

09:26.500 --> 09:29.960
 and with a particular intensity, that's a given song.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.720
 We can make that analogous to a given experience.

09:32.720 --> 09:37.720
 It's not really that the key A-sharp or E-flat is the song.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.120
 It's just one component of the song.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.960
 So when you hear that, for instance,

09:43.960 --> 09:46.140
 there's a brain area called the hippocampus,

09:46.140 --> 09:49.000
 which there is, that's involved in memory.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.800
 Well, it's involved in memory,

09:50.800 --> 09:54.740
 but it's not that memories are stored there as sentences.

09:54.740 --> 09:58.040
 They're stored there as patterns of electricity and neurons

09:58.040 --> 10:00.720
 that when repeated give you the sense

10:00.720 --> 10:02.920
 that you are experiencing the thing again.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.840
 In fact, deja vu, the sense that what you're experiencing

10:06.840 --> 10:08.960
 is so familiar and like something

10:08.960 --> 10:10.880
 that you've experienced previously

10:10.880 --> 10:14.380
 is merely that the neurons that were active

10:14.380 --> 10:16.740
 in one circumstance are now becoming active

10:16.740 --> 10:18.760
 in the same circumstance again.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.600
 And so it's really just like hearing the same song

10:21.600 --> 10:23.280
 maybe not played on a piano,

10:23.280 --> 10:25.680
 but next time on a classical guitar,

10:25.680 --> 10:27.760
 there's something similar about that song,

10:27.760 --> 10:30.080
 even though it's being played on two different instruments.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.860
 So I think it's important that people understand

10:32.860 --> 10:34.720
 the parts of their nervous system

10:34.720 --> 10:38.200
 and that it includes so much more than just the brain

10:38.200 --> 10:40.980
 and that there are these things, neurons and synapses,

10:40.980 --> 10:44.640
 but really that it's the electrical activity of these neurons

10:44.640 --> 10:47.100
 that dictates our experience.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.360
 So if the early 1900s

10:49.360 --> 10:51.360
 were when these neurons were discovered,

10:51.360 --> 10:53.440
 certainly a lot has happened since then.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.760
 And in that time between the early 1900s and now,

10:57.760 --> 10:59.840
 there's some important events that actually happened

10:59.840 --> 11:03.040
 in history that give us insight

11:03.040 --> 11:05.880
 or gave us insight into how the nervous system works.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.580
 One of the more surprising ones was actually warfare.

11:09.580 --> 11:13.120
 So as most everybody knows in warfare,

11:13.120 --> 11:16.120
 people get shot and people often die,

11:16.120 --> 11:18.700
 but many people get shot and they don't die.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.200
 And in World War I,

11:21.200 --> 11:25.300
 there were some changes in artillery, in bullets,

11:25.300 --> 11:29.840
 that made for a situation where bullets would enter

11:29.840 --> 11:33.300
 the body and brain at very discreet locations

11:33.300 --> 11:35.960
 and would go out the other side of the body or brain

11:35.960 --> 11:39.280
 and also make a very small hole at that exit location.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.360
 And in doing so produced a lot of naturally occurring

11:42.360 --> 11:44.200
 lesions of the nervous system.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.320
 Now you say, okay, well, how does that relate

11:46.320 --> 11:47.140
 to neuroscience?

11:47.140 --> 11:52.140
 Well, unlike previous years where a lot of the artillery

11:52.160 --> 11:54.560
 would create these big sort of holes

11:54.560 --> 11:57.480
 as the bullets would blow out of the brain or body,

11:57.480 --> 11:59.320
 I know this is rather gruesome,

11:59.320 --> 12:01.560
 when the holes were very discreet,

12:01.560 --> 12:04.140
 they entered at one point and left at another point,

12:04.140 --> 12:07.900
 they would take out or destroy very discreet bits

12:07.900 --> 12:10.420
 of neural tissue of the nervous system.

12:10.420 --> 12:13.060
 So people were coming back from war

12:13.060 --> 12:15.600
 with holes in their brain and in other parts

12:15.600 --> 12:17.660
 of their nervous system that were limited

12:17.660 --> 12:19.200
 to very specific locations.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.960
 In addition to that, there was some advancement

12:21.960 --> 12:25.200
 in the cleaning of wounds that happened,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.340
 so many more people were surviving.

12:28.260 --> 12:31.600
 What this meant was that neurologists now had a collection

12:31.600 --> 12:34.820
 of patients that would come back and they'd have holes

12:34.820 --> 12:37.280
 in very specific locations of their brain

12:37.280 --> 12:42.200
 and they'd say things like, well, I can recognize faces,

12:42.200 --> 12:45.640
 but I can't recognize who those faces belong to.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.440
 I know it's a face, but I don't know who it belongs to.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.840
 And after that person eventually died,

12:50.840 --> 12:52.040
 the neurologist would figure out,

12:52.040 --> 12:54.660
 ah, I've had 10 patients that all told me

12:54.660 --> 12:56.080
 that they couldn't recognize faces

12:56.080 --> 12:57.440
 and they all had these bullet holes

12:57.440 --> 12:59.360
 that went through a particular region of the brain

12:59.360 --> 13:00.440
 and that's how we know a lot

13:00.440 --> 13:03.820
 about how particular brain regions like the hippocampus work.

13:03.820 --> 13:07.980
 In fact, some of the more amazing examples of this

13:07.980 --> 13:10.520
 where people would come back and they, for instance,

13:10.520 --> 13:13.080
 would speak in complete gibberish,

13:13.080 --> 13:15.680
 whereas previously they could speak normally.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.520
 And even though they were speaking in complete gibberish,

13:18.520 --> 13:20.280
 they could understand language perfectly.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.920
 That's how we know that speech and language

13:21.920 --> 13:24.160
 are actually controlled by separate portions

13:24.160 --> 13:25.160
 of the nervous system.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.120
 And there are many examples like that,

13:27.120 --> 13:31.800
 people that couldn't recognize the faces of famous people.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.560
 Or, and that actually brings us to an interesting example

13:34.560 --> 13:35.720
 in modern times.

13:35.720 --> 13:39.160
 Many, many years later in the early 2000s,

13:39.160 --> 13:41.000
 there was actually a paper that was published

13:41.000 --> 13:42.860
 in the journal Nature, excellent journal,

13:42.860 --> 13:45.780
 showing that in a human being,

13:45.780 --> 13:47.580
 a perfectly healthy human being,

13:47.580 --> 13:50.760
 there was a neuron that would become active,

13:50.760 --> 13:54.600
 electrically active only when the person viewed

13:54.600 --> 13:57.120
 the picture of Jennifer Aniston, the actress.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.080
 So literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston,

14:00.080 --> 14:01.560
 so-called Jennifer Aniston cells.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.840
 Neuroscientists know about these Jennifer Aniston cells.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.960
 If you can recognize Jennifer Aniston's face,

14:05.960 --> 14:08.800
 you have Jennifer Aniston neurons

14:08.800 --> 14:11.040
 and presumably also have neurons that can recognize

14:11.040 --> 14:14.440
 the faces of other famous and non-famous people.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.440
 So that indicates that our brain is really a map

14:18.440 --> 14:20.240
 of our experience.

14:20.240 --> 14:23.040
 We come into the world and our brain has a kind of bias

14:23.040 --> 14:24.920
 towards learning particular kinds of things.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.840
 It's ready to receive information

14:26.840 --> 14:28.400
 and learn that information,

14:28.400 --> 14:31.620
 but the brain is really a map of experience.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.600
 So let's talk about what experience really is.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.400
 What does it mean for your brain to work?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.560
 Well, I think it's fair to say

14:38.560 --> 14:42.280
 that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.320
 The first one is sensation.

14:44.320 --> 14:48.520
 So this is important to understand for any and all of you

14:48.520 --> 14:50.520
 that want to change your nervous system

14:50.520 --> 14:53.520
 or to apply tools to make your nervous system work better.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.160
 Sensation is a non-negotiable element

14:56.160 --> 14:57.380
 of your nervous system.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.680
 You have neurons in your eye that perceive

14:59.680 --> 15:03.080
 certain colors of light and certain directions of movement.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.060
 You have neurons in your skin

15:05.060 --> 15:07.580
 that perceive particular kinds of touch,

15:07.580 --> 15:10.920
 like light touch or firm touch or painful touch.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.000
 You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.720
 Your entire experience of life is filtered

15:19.720 --> 15:22.480
 by these what we call sensory receptors,

15:22.480 --> 15:24.760
 if you want to know what the name is.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.720
 So this always raises an interesting question.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.380
 People ask, well, is there much more out there?

15:29.380 --> 15:31.560
 Is there a lot more happening in the world

15:31.560 --> 15:35.560
 that I'm not experiencing or that humans aren't experiencing?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.440
 And the answer of course is yes.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.200
 There are many species on this planet

15:39.200 --> 15:42.100
 that are perceiving things that we will never perceive

15:42.100 --> 15:44.480
 unless we apply technology.

15:44.480 --> 15:48.160
 The best example I could think of off the top of my head

15:48.160 --> 15:50.540
 would be something like infrared vision.

15:50.540 --> 15:53.720
 There are snakes out there, pit vipers and so forth

15:53.720 --> 15:56.080
 that can sense heat emissions from other animals.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.680
 They don't actually see their shape.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.400
 They sense their heat shape and their heat emissions.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.280
 Humans can't do that unless of course

16:03.280 --> 16:05.480
 they put on infrared goggles or something

16:05.480 --> 16:08.360
 that would allow them to detect those heat emissions.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.520
 There are turtles and certain species of birds

16:11.520 --> 16:15.200
 that migrate long distances that can detect magnetic fields

16:15.200 --> 16:16.940
 because they have neurons.

16:16.940 --> 16:20.520
 Again, it's the nervous system that allows them to do this.

16:20.520 --> 16:24.320
 So they have neurons in their nose and in their head

16:24.320 --> 16:27.520
 that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields

16:27.520 --> 16:29.980
 in order to, as amazing as this sounds,

16:29.980 --> 16:33.120
 go from one particular location in the ocean,

16:33.120 --> 16:37.280
 thousands of miles away to all aggregate

16:37.280 --> 16:40.560
 on one particular beach at a particular time of year

16:40.560 --> 16:43.200
 so that they can mate, lay eggs

16:43.200 --> 16:45.800
 and then wander back off into the sea to die

16:45.800 --> 16:48.840
 and then their young will eventually hatch.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.800
 Those cute little turtles will shuffle to the ocean,

16:51.800 --> 16:54.400
 swim off and go do the exact same thing.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.780
 They don't migrate that distance by vision.

16:56.780 --> 16:57.840
 They don't do it by smell.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.180
 They do it by sensing magnetic fields, okay?

17:01.180 --> 17:03.980
 And many other species do these incredible things.

17:03.980 --> 17:07.480
 We don't, humans are not magnetic sensing organisms.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.860
 We can't do that because we don't have receptors

17:09.860 --> 17:11.640
 that sense magnetic fields.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.160
 There are some data that maybe some humans

17:14.160 --> 17:15.840
 can sense magnetic fields,

17:15.840 --> 17:17.460
 but you should be very skeptical of anyone

17:17.460 --> 17:19.160
 that's convinced that they can do that

17:19.160 --> 17:22.260
 with any degree of robustness or accuracy

17:22.260 --> 17:24.560
 because even the people that can do this

17:24.560 --> 17:26.920
 aren't necessarily aware that they can.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.240
 Maybe a topic for a future podcast.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.700
 So we have sensation.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.000
 Then we have perception.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.160
 Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing

17:36.160 --> 17:39.340
 and focus on it and make sense of it,

17:39.340 --> 17:40.960
 to explore it, to remember it.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.560
 So really perceptions are just whichever sensations

17:43.560 --> 17:46.200
 we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.680
 And you can do this right now.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.540
 You can experience perception

17:49.540 --> 17:51.080
 and the difference between perception

17:51.080 --> 17:53.280
 and sensation very easily.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.520
 If for instance, I tell you to pay attention

17:56.520 --> 17:59.360
 to the contact of your feet, the bottoms of your feet

17:59.360 --> 18:01.880
 with whatever surface they happen to be in contact with,

18:01.880 --> 18:04.600
 maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.160
 If your feet are up, maybe it's air.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.040
 The moment you place your,

18:09.040 --> 18:10.840
 what we call the spotlight of attention

18:10.840 --> 18:13.160
 or the spotlight of perception on your feet,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.840
 you are now perceiving what was happening there,

18:15.840 --> 18:18.120
 what was being sensed there.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.840
 The sensation was happening all along, however.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.760
 So while sensation is not negotiable,

18:24.760 --> 18:26.280
 you can't change your receptors

18:26.280 --> 18:28.720
 unless you adopt some new technology.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.160
 Perception is under the control of your attention.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.720
 And the way to think about attention

18:33.720 --> 18:37.040
 is it's like a spotlight, except it's not one spotlight.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.680
 You actually have two attentional spotlights.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.020
 Anyone that tells you you can't multitask,

18:43.020 --> 18:44.400
 tell them they're wrong.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.440
 And if they disagree with you, tell them to contact me.

18:47.440 --> 18:52.440
 Because in old world primates of which humans are,

18:52.680 --> 18:55.680
 we are able to do what's called covert attention.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.360
 We can place a spotlight of attention on something.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.760
 For instance, something we're reading or looking at,

19:00.760 --> 19:02.080
 or someone that we're listening to.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.200
 And we can place a second spotlight of attention

19:05.200 --> 19:07.360
 on something we're eating and how it tastes,

19:07.360 --> 19:10.660
 or our child running around in the room or my dog.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.000
 You can split your attention into two locations,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.920
 but of course you can also bring your attention,

19:15.920 --> 19:19.440
 that is your perception, to one particular location.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.880
 You can dilate your attention,

19:20.880 --> 19:23.060
 kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse,

19:23.060 --> 19:25.120
 or you can make it more concentrated.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.900
 This is very important to understand

19:27.900 --> 19:29.860
 if you're going to think about tools

19:29.860 --> 19:31.800
 to improve your nervous system,

19:31.800 --> 19:35.200
 whether or not that tool is in the form of a chemical

19:35.200 --> 19:36.260
 that you decide to take,

19:36.260 --> 19:38.820
 maybe a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain,

19:38.820 --> 19:43.160
 if that's your choice, or a brain machine device,

19:43.160 --> 19:45.640
 or you're going to try and learn something better

19:45.640 --> 19:49.100
 by engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit

19:49.100 --> 19:51.200
 for some period of time each day.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.340
 Attention is something that is absolutely under your control,

19:55.340 --> 19:57.800
 in particular, when you're rested.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.860
 And we'll get back to this, but when you are rested,

20:01.880 --> 20:04.500
 and we'll define rest very clearly,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.640
 you are able to direct your attention

20:06.640 --> 20:08.060
 in very deliberate ways.

20:08.060 --> 20:11.980
 And that's because we have something in our nervous system

20:11.980 --> 20:14.320
 which is sort of like a two-way street.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.460
 And that two-way street is a communication

20:16.460 --> 20:18.260
 between the aspects of our nervous system

20:18.260 --> 20:22.120
 that are reflexive and the aspects of our nervous system

20:22.120 --> 20:23.480
 that are deliberate.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.140
 So we all know what it's like to be reflexive.

20:26.140 --> 20:27.860
 You go through life, you're walking.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.080
 If you already know how to walk,

20:29.080 --> 20:31.880
 you don't think about your walking, you just walk.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.640
 And that's because the nervous system wants to pass off

20:34.640 --> 20:36.760
 as much as it can to reflexive action.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.600
 That's called a bottom-up processing.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.420
 It really just means that information is flowing in

20:42.420 --> 20:45.640
 through your senses, regardless of what you're perceiving,

20:45.640 --> 20:46.960
 that information is flowing up

20:46.960 --> 20:49.280
 and it's directing your activity.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.280
 But at any moment, for instance,

20:51.280 --> 20:54.360
 let's say a car screeches in front of you around the corner

20:54.360 --> 20:55.700
 and you suddenly pause,

20:55.700 --> 20:58.440
 you are now moving into deliberate action.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.720
 You would start looking around in a very deliberate way.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.520
 The nervous system can be reflexive in its action

21:04.520 --> 21:06.240
 or it can be deliberate.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.920
 If reflexive action tends to be what we call bottom-up,

21:09.920 --> 21:13.180
 deliberate action and deliberate perceptions

21:13.180 --> 21:15.600
 and deliberate thoughts are top-down.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.960
 They require some effort and some focus,

21:17.960 --> 21:18.900
 but that's the point.

21:18.900 --> 21:21.560
 You can decide to focus your attention and energy

21:21.560 --> 21:22.840
 on anything you want.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.520
 You can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want,

21:26.520 --> 21:30.600
 but it will always feel like it requires some effort

21:30.600 --> 21:31.460
 and some strain.

21:31.460 --> 21:32.800
 Whereas when you're in reflexive mode,

21:32.800 --> 21:35.720
 just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing,

21:35.720 --> 21:37.280
 it's gonna feel very easy.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.840
 And that's because your nervous system basically wired up

21:39.840 --> 21:41.880
 to be able to do most things easily

21:41.880 --> 21:43.500
 without much metabolic demand,

21:43.500 --> 21:45.040
 without consuming much energy.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.360
 But the moment you try and do something very specific,

21:48.360 --> 21:50.860
 you're gonna feel a sort of mental friction.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.440
 It's gonna be challenging.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.960
 So we've got sensations, perceptions,

21:54.960 --> 21:58.160
 and then we've got things that we call feelings slash

21:58.160 --> 21:59.000
 emotions.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.800
 And these get a little complicated because almost all of us,

22:02.800 --> 22:05.640
 I would hope all of us are familiar with things like

22:05.640 --> 22:09.800
 happiness and sadness or boredom or frustration.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.840
 Scientists argue like crazy,

22:11.840 --> 22:14.160
 neuroscientists and psychologists and philosophers

22:14.160 --> 22:15.000
 for that matter,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.720
 argue like crazy about what these are and how they work.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.440
 Certainly emotions and feelings are the product

22:21.440 --> 22:23.020
 of the nervous system.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.560
 They involve the activity of neurons.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.500
 But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are electrically active,

22:28.500 --> 22:30.680
 but they also release chemicals.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.860
 And there's a certain category of chemicals

22:33.860 --> 22:38.160
 that has a very profound influence on our emotional states.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.440
 They're called neuromodulators.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.040
 And those neuromodulators have names

22:43.040 --> 22:44.640
 that probably you've heard of before.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.360
 Things like dopamine and serotonin and acetylcholine,

22:48.360 --> 22:49.920
 epinephrine.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.480
 Neuromodulators are really interesting because they bias

22:53.480 --> 22:55.760
 which neurons are likely to be active

22:55.760 --> 22:58.660
 and which ones are likely to be inactive.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.200
 A simple way to think about neuromodulators is

23:01.200 --> 23:04.660
 they are sort of like playlists that you would have

23:04.660 --> 23:06.280
 on any kind of device where you're gonna play

23:06.280 --> 23:08.200
 particular categories of music.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.820
 So for instance, dopamine,

23:09.820 --> 23:14.820
 which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy

23:14.920 --> 23:16.920
 is involved in reward.

23:16.920 --> 23:20.000
 And it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood

23:21.220 --> 23:23.420
 when released in appropriate amounts in the brain.

23:23.420 --> 23:25.080
 But the reason it does that is

23:25.080 --> 23:29.120
 because it makes certain neurons and neural circuits

23:29.120 --> 23:32.920
 as we call them more active and others less active, okay?

23:32.920 --> 23:37.160
 So serotonin for instance, is a molecule that when released

23:37.160 --> 23:40.360
 tends to make us feel really good with what we have,

23:40.360 --> 23:41.940
 our sort of internal landscape

23:41.940 --> 23:43.640
 and the resources that we have.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.320
 Whereas dopamine more than being a molecule of reward

23:46.320 --> 23:49.320
 is really more a molecule of motivation

23:49.320 --> 23:52.760
 toward things that are outside us and that we want to pursue.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.480
 And we can look at healthy conditions or situations

23:57.480 --> 23:59.400
 like being in pursuit of a goal

23:59.400 --> 24:01.240
 where every time we accomplish something

24:01.240 --> 24:03.660
 in route to that goal, a little bit of dopamine is released

24:03.660 --> 24:06.600
 and we feel more motivation, that happens.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.760
 We can also look at the extreme example

24:08.760 --> 24:10.120
 of something like mania,

24:10.120 --> 24:14.500
 where somebody is so relentlessly in pursuit

24:14.500 --> 24:17.560
 of external things like money and relationships

24:17.560 --> 24:19.960
 that they're sort of in this delusional state

24:19.960 --> 24:22.180
 of thinking that they have the resources that they need

24:22.180 --> 24:24.620
 in order to pursue all these things when in fact they don't.

24:24.620 --> 24:28.400
 So these neuromodulators can exist in normal levels,

24:28.400 --> 24:29.720
 low levels, high levels.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.480
 And that actually gives us a window

24:31.480 --> 24:34.960
 into a very important aspect of neuroscience history

24:34.960 --> 24:36.860
 that all of us are impacted by today,

24:36.860 --> 24:39.120
 which is the discovery of antidepressants

24:39.120 --> 24:41.080
 and so-called antipsychotics.

24:41.080 --> 24:45.000
 In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, it was discovered

24:45.000 --> 24:47.420
 that there are compounds, chemicals,

24:47.420 --> 24:50.080
 that can increase or decrease serotonin,

24:50.080 --> 24:52.800
 that can increase or decrease dopamine.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.980
 And that led to the development

24:54.980 --> 24:57.960
 of most of what we call antidepressants.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.000
 Now, the trick here or the problem

25:01.000 --> 25:03.320
 is that most of these drugs,

25:03.320 --> 25:05.680
 especially in the 1950s and 60s,

25:05.680 --> 25:07.040
 they would reduce serotonin,

25:07.040 --> 25:08.720
 but they would also reduce dopamine,

25:08.720 --> 25:10.080
 or they would increase serotonin,

25:10.080 --> 25:11.440
 but they would also increase

25:11.440 --> 25:13.280
 some other neuromodulator or chemical.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.300
 And that's because all these chemical systems in the body,

25:17.300 --> 25:19.440
 but the neuromodulators in particular,

25:19.440 --> 25:21.360
 have a lot of receptors.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.800
 Now, these are different than the receptors

25:22.800 --> 25:24.000
 we were talking about earlier.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.360
 The receptors I'm talking about now

25:25.360 --> 25:28.720
 are sort of like parking spots where dopamine is released.

25:28.720 --> 25:32.940
 And if it attaches to a receptor, say on the heart,

25:32.940 --> 25:35.160
 it might make the heart beat faster

25:35.160 --> 25:37.580
 because there's a certain kind of receptor on the heart.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.280
 Whereas if dopamine is released

25:40.280 --> 25:42.440
 and goes and attaches to muscle,

25:42.440 --> 25:44.640
 it might have a completely different effect on muscle.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.480
 And in fact, it does.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.140
 So different receptors on different organs of the body

25:49.140 --> 25:51.420
 are the ways that these neuromodulators

25:51.420 --> 25:53.720
 can have all these different effects

25:53.720 --> 25:55.860
 on different aspects of our biology.

25:55.860 --> 25:58.840
 This is most salient in the example

25:58.840 --> 26:01.160
 of some of the antidepressants

26:01.160 --> 26:03.600
 that have sexual side effects,

26:03.600 --> 26:06.880
 or that blunt appetite, or that blunt motivation.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.280
 You know, many of these which increase serotonin

26:10.280 --> 26:12.320
 can be very beneficial for people.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.760
 It can elevate their mood, it can make them feel better,

26:14.760 --> 26:18.000
 but they also, if the doses are too high,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.600
 or if that particular drug isn't right for somebody,

26:20.600 --> 26:23.360
 that person experiences challenges with motivation,

26:23.360 --> 26:24.800
 or appetite, or libido,

26:24.800 --> 26:27.800
 because serotonin is binding to receptors

26:27.800 --> 26:28.680
 in the areas of the brain

26:28.680 --> 26:31.160
 that control those other things as well.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.440
 So we talked about sensation, we talked about perception.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.480
 When we talk about feelings,

26:35.480 --> 26:38.000
 we have to consider these neuromodulators.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.260
 And we have to consider also

26:39.260 --> 26:42.720
 that feelings and emotions are contextual.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.600
 In some cultures, showing a lot of joy

26:45.600 --> 26:47.860
 or a lot of sadness is entirely appropriate.

26:47.860 --> 26:50.440
 In other cultures, it's considered inappropriate.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.820
 So I don't think it's fair to say

26:51.820 --> 26:55.180
 that there's a sadness circuit or area of the brain,

26:55.180 --> 26:57.520
 or a happiness circuit or area of the brain.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.420
 However, it is fair to say that certain chemicals

27:01.420 --> 27:04.040
 and certain brain circuits tend to be active

27:04.040 --> 27:05.640
 when we are in motivated states,

27:05.640 --> 27:09.360
 tend to be active when we are in non-motivated, lazy states,

27:09.360 --> 27:11.600
 tend to be active when we are focused,

27:11.600 --> 27:14.060
 and tend to be active when we are not focused.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.240
 I want to emphasize also that emotions

27:19.240 --> 27:21.980
 are something that we generally feel

27:21.980 --> 27:23.220
 are not under our control.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.080
 We feel like the kind of guys are up within us

27:25.080 --> 27:27.180
 and they just kind of happen to us.

27:27.180 --> 27:29.880
 And that's because they are somewhat reflexive.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.400
 We don't really set out

27:31.400 --> 27:33.040
 with a deliberate thought to be happy

27:33.040 --> 27:34.780
 or deliberate thought to be sad.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.120
 We tend to experience them

27:36.120 --> 27:38.840
 in kind of a passive reflexive way.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.800
 And that brings us to the next thing, which are thoughts.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.000
 Thoughts are really interesting

27:43.000 --> 27:45.720
 because in many ways they're like perceptions,

27:45.720 --> 27:48.340
 except that they draw on not just what's happening

27:48.340 --> 27:52.280
 in the present, but also things we remember from the past

27:52.280 --> 27:55.080
 and things that we anticipate about the future.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.020
 The other thing about thoughts that's really interesting

27:57.020 --> 28:00.760
 is that thoughts can be both reflexive,

28:00.760 --> 28:02.640
 they can just be occurring all the time,

28:02.640 --> 28:04.380
 sort of like pop-up windows

28:04.380 --> 28:06.920
 on a poorly filtered web browser,

28:06.920 --> 28:08.440
 or they can be deliberate.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.040
 We can decide to have a thought.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.080
 In fact, right now you could decide to have a thought

28:12.080 --> 28:13.920
 just like you would decide to write something out

28:13.920 --> 28:15.280
 on a piece of paper.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.640
 You could decide that you're listening to a podcast,

28:17.640 --> 28:19.840
 that you are in a particular location.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.520
 You're not just paying attention to what's happening,

28:21.520 --> 28:23.760
 you're directing your thought process.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.520
 And a lot of people don't understand

28:25.520 --> 28:27.740
 or at least appreciate that the thought patterns

28:27.740 --> 28:30.560
 and the neural circuits that underlie thoughts

28:30.560 --> 28:33.680
 can actually be controlled in this deliberate way.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.340
 And then finally, there are actions.

28:36.340 --> 28:40.160
 Actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect

28:40.160 --> 28:41.560
 to our nervous system.

28:41.560 --> 28:46.040
 Because first of all, our behaviors are actually

28:46.040 --> 28:49.200
 the only thing that are gonna create any fossil record

28:49.200 --> 28:50.720
 of our existence.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.120
 After we die, the nervous system deteriorates,

28:53.120 --> 28:57.000
 our skeleton will remain, but it's in the moment

28:57.000 --> 28:59.520
 of experiencing something very joyful

28:59.520 --> 29:01.520
 or something very sad.

29:01.520 --> 29:05.880
 It can feel so all encompassing that we actually think

29:05.880 --> 29:08.160
 that it has some meaning beyond that moment.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.000
 But actually for humans, and I think for all species,

29:12.840 --> 29:16.480
 the sensations, the perceptions and the thoughts

29:16.480 --> 29:19.760
 and the feelings that we have in our lifespan,

29:19.760 --> 29:22.700
 none of that is actually carried forward

29:22.700 --> 29:25.760
 except the ones that we take and we convert

29:25.760 --> 29:30.440
 into actions such as writing, actions such as words,

29:30.440 --> 29:32.680
 actions such as engineering new things.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.540
 And so the fossil record of our species

29:35.540 --> 29:39.040
 and of each one of us is really through action.

29:39.040 --> 29:43.320
 And that in part is why so much of our nervous system

29:43.320 --> 29:46.840
 is devoted to converting sensation, perceptions,

29:46.840 --> 29:49.660
 feelings, and thoughts into actions.

29:49.660 --> 29:54.360
 In fact, the great neuroscientist or physiologist,

29:54.360 --> 29:57.320
 Sherrington won a Nobel Prize for his work

29:57.320 --> 29:59.960
 in mapping some of the circuitry,

29:59.960 --> 30:01.480
 the connections between nerve cells

30:01.480 --> 30:03.420
 that give rise to movement.

30:03.420 --> 30:07.160
 And he said, movement is the final common pathway.

30:07.160 --> 30:10.360
 The other way to think about it is that one of the reasons

30:10.360 --> 30:13.120
 that our central nervous system, our brain and spinal cord

30:13.120 --> 30:14.940
 include this stuff in our skull,

30:14.940 --> 30:17.120
 but also connects so heavily to the body

30:17.120 --> 30:19.820
 is because most everything that we experience,

30:19.820 --> 30:22.960
 including our thoughts and feelings was really designed

30:22.960 --> 30:25.920
 to either impact our behavior or not.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.760
 And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past

30:28.760 --> 30:30.980
 and anticipate the future and not just experience

30:30.980 --> 30:33.320
 what's happening in the moment gave rise

30:33.320 --> 30:37.100
 to an incredible capacity for us to engage in behaviors

30:37.100 --> 30:38.840
 that are not just for the moment.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.920
 They're based on things that we know from the past

30:40.920 --> 30:43.960
 and that we would like to see in the future.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.800
 And this aspect to our nervous system of creating movement

30:47.800 --> 30:50.480
 occurs through some very simple pathways.

30:50.480 --> 30:54.140
 The reflexive pathway basically includes areas

30:54.140 --> 30:57.000
 of the brainstem we call central pattern generators.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.040
 When you walk, provided you already know how to walk,

31:00.040 --> 31:03.100
 you are basically walking

31:03.100 --> 31:05.000
 because you have these central pattern generators,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.160
 groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot,

31:07.160 --> 31:09.040
 right foot, left foot kind of movement.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.600
 However, when you decide to move

31:10.600 --> 31:12.160
 in a particular deliberate way

31:12.160 --> 31:14.240
 that requires a little more attention,

31:14.240 --> 31:17.520
 you start to engage areas of your brain

31:17.520 --> 31:21.160
 for top-down processing where your forebrain works

31:21.160 --> 31:24.600
 from the top down to control those central pattern generators

31:24.600 --> 31:26.820
 so that maybe it's right foot, right foot, left foot,

31:26.820 --> 31:27.960
 right foot, right foot, left foot

31:27.960 --> 31:30.120
 if maybe you're hiking along some rocks or something

31:30.120 --> 31:32.560
 and you have to engage in that kind of movement.

31:32.560 --> 31:36.000
 So movement is just like thoughts,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.440
 can be either reflexive or deliberate.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.000
 And when we talk about deliberate,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.020
 I want to be very specific about how your brain works

31:44.020 --> 31:46.340
 in the deliberate way because it gives rise

31:46.340 --> 31:49.140
 to a very important feature of the nervous system

31:49.140 --> 31:50.240
 that we're going to talk about next

31:50.240 --> 31:53.240
 which is your ability to change your nervous system.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.360
 And what I'd like to center on for a second is this notion

31:56.360 --> 31:58.960
 of what does it mean for the nervous system

31:58.960 --> 32:01.060
 to do something deliberately?

32:01.060 --> 32:03.480
 Well, when you do something deliberately,

32:03.480 --> 32:06.680
 you pay attention, you are bringing your perception

32:06.680 --> 32:09.460
 to an analysis of three things.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.680
 Duration, how long something is going to take

32:12.680 --> 32:16.400
 or it should be done, path, what you should be doing,

32:16.400 --> 32:17.320
 and outcome.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.360
 If you do something for a given length of time,

32:19.360 --> 32:20.600
 what's going to happen?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.540
 Now, when you're walking down the street or you're eating

32:22.540 --> 32:24.200
 or you're just talking reflexively,

32:24.200 --> 32:26.200
 you're not doing this what I call DPO,

32:26.200 --> 32:29.400
 duration, path, outcome type of deliberate function

32:29.400 --> 32:31.280
 in your brain and nervous system.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.080
 But the moment you decide to learn something

32:34.080 --> 32:37.280
 or to resist speaking or to speak up

32:37.280 --> 32:39.400
 when you would rather be quiet,

32:39.400 --> 32:42.240
 anytime you're deliberately forcing yourself

32:42.240 --> 32:46.480
 over a threshold, you're engaging these brain circuits

32:46.480 --> 32:48.360
 and these nervous system circuits

32:48.360 --> 32:52.120
 that suddenly make it feel as if something is challenging,

32:52.120 --> 32:53.600
 something has changed.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.720
 Well, what's changed?

32:54.720 --> 32:57.620
 What's changed is that when you engage in this duration,

32:57.620 --> 33:00.840
 path and outcome type of thinking or behavior

33:00.840 --> 33:05.840
 or way of being, you start to recruit these neuromodulators

33:06.020 --> 33:08.320
 that are released from particular areas of your brain

33:08.320 --> 33:09.920
 and also it turns out from your body,

33:09.920 --> 33:12.240
 and they start queuing to your nervous system,

33:12.240 --> 33:14.160
 something's different, something's different now

33:14.160 --> 33:15.280
 about what I'm doing,

33:15.280 --> 33:17.380
 something's different about what I'm feeling.

33:17.380 --> 33:21.160
 Let's give an example where perhaps somebody says something

33:21.160 --> 33:23.320
 that's triggering to you, you don't like it,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.340
 and you know you shouldn't respond.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.000
 You feel like, oh, I shouldn't respond,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.400
 I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.840
 You're actively suppressing your behavior

33:30.840 --> 33:33.640
 through top-down processing.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.580
 Your forebrain is actually preventing you

33:35.580 --> 33:38.320
 from saying the thing that you know you shouldn't say

33:38.320 --> 33:40.080
 or that maybe you should wait to say or say

33:40.080 --> 33:41.560
 in a different form.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.760
 This feels like agitation and stress

33:43.760 --> 33:46.120
 because you're actually suppressing a circuit.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.420
 We actually can see examples of what happens

33:48.420 --> 33:51.100
 when you're not doing this well.

33:51.100 --> 33:53.960
 Some of the examples come from children.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.440
 If you look at young children,

33:55.440 --> 33:57.900
 they don't have the forebrain circuitry

33:57.900 --> 33:59.880
 to engage in this top-down processing

33:59.880 --> 34:03.320
 until they reach age 22, even 25.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.920
 But in young children, you see this in a really robust way.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.720
 You'll see they'll be rocking back and forth.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.000
 It's hard for them to sit still

34:10.000 --> 34:11.960
 because those central pattern generators

34:11.960 --> 34:13.400
 are constantly going in the background,

34:13.400 --> 34:15.400
 whereas adults can sit still.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.600
 A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants

34:17.600 --> 34:19.660
 and will just reach out and grab it,

34:19.660 --> 34:21.580
 whereas an adult probably would ask

34:21.580 --> 34:22.420
 if they could have a piece

34:22.420 --> 34:25.560
 or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.000
 People that have damage to the certain areas

34:28.000 --> 34:31.120
 of the frontal lobes don't have this kind of restriction.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.560
 They'll just blurt things out.

34:32.560 --> 34:33.480
 They'll just say things.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.960
 We all know people like this.

34:34.960 --> 34:38.960
 Impulsivity is a lack of top-down control,

34:38.960 --> 34:41.120
 a lack of top-down processing.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.160
 The other thing that will turn off the forebrain

34:43.160 --> 34:45.280
 and make it harder to top-down processing

34:45.280 --> 34:48.560
 is a couple of drinks containing alcohol.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.380
 The removal of inhibition

34:50.380 --> 34:53.560
 is actually a removal of neural inhibition

34:53.560 --> 34:56.080
 of nerve cells suppressing the activity

34:56.080 --> 34:57.440
 of other nerve cells.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.320
 And so when you look at people

34:59.320 --> 35:01.120
 that have damage to their frontal lobes,

35:01.120 --> 35:04.080
 or you look at puppies, or you look at young children,

35:04.080 --> 35:05.440
 everything's a stimulus.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.420
 Everything is a potential interaction for them,

35:07.420 --> 35:08.860
 and they have a very hard time

35:08.860 --> 35:11.520
 restricting their behavior and their speech.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.920
 So a lot of the motor system

35:13.920 --> 35:16.840
 is designed to just work in a reflexive way.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.760
 And then when we decide we want to learn something

35:18.760 --> 35:21.180
 or do something or not do something,

35:21.180 --> 35:23.680
 we have to engage in this top-down restriction,

35:23.680 --> 35:25.280
 and it feels like agitation

35:25.280 --> 35:27.160
 because it's accompanied by the release

35:27.160 --> 35:30.080
 of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine,

35:30.080 --> 35:32.080
 which in the body we call adrenaline,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.320
 and it actually makes us feel agitated.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.980
 So for those of you that are trying to learn something new

35:36.980 --> 35:39.120
 or to learn to suppress your responses

35:39.120 --> 35:42.080
 or be more deliberate and careful in your responses,

35:43.140 --> 35:46.480
 that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.540
 It's going to feel challenging

35:47.540 --> 35:49.160
 because the chemicals in your body

35:49.160 --> 35:52.420
 that are released in association with that effort

35:52.420 --> 35:55.640
 are designed to make you feel kind of agitated.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.620
 That low-level tremor that sometimes people feel

35:57.620 --> 35:59.060
 when they're really, really angry

35:59.060 --> 36:02.400
 is actually a chemically induced low-level tremor.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.920
 And it's the, what I call limbic friction.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.380
 There's an area of your brain that's involved

36:06.380 --> 36:08.560
 in our more primitive reflexive responses

36:08.560 --> 36:09.960
 called the limbic system.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.760
 And the frontal cortex is in a friction.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.000
 It's in a tug-of-war with that system all the time,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.240
 unless of course you have damage to the frontal lobe

36:18.240 --> 36:19.760
 or you've had too much to drink or something,

36:19.760 --> 36:22.320
 in which case you tend to just say and do whatever.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.460
 And so this is really important to understand

36:25.460 --> 36:28.720
 because if you want to understand neuroplasticity,

36:28.720 --> 36:30.740
 you want to understand how to shape your behavior,

36:30.740 --> 36:31.840
 how to shape your thinking,

36:31.840 --> 36:36.700
 how to change how you're able to perform in any context,

36:36.700 --> 36:38.600
 the most important thing to understand

36:38.600 --> 36:41.760
 is that it requires top-down processing.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.760
 It requires this feeling of agitation.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.260
 In fact, I would say that agitation and strain

36:47.260 --> 36:50.240
 is the entry point to neuroplasticity.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.920
 So let's take a look at what neuroplasticity is.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.000
 Let's explore it not as the way it's normally talked about

36:56.000 --> 36:58.720
 in modern culture as a neuroplasticity.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.360
 Plasticity is great.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.000
 What exactly do people mean?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.400
 Plasticity itself is just a process by which neurons

37:05.400 --> 37:07.740
 can change their connections in the way they work

37:07.740 --> 37:10.720
 so that you can go from things

37:10.720 --> 37:13.480
 being very challenging and deliberate,

37:13.480 --> 37:15.480
 requiring a lot of effort and strain

37:15.480 --> 37:17.040
 to them being reflexive.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.800
 And typically when we hear about plasticity,

37:18.800 --> 37:19.920
 we're thinking about positive

37:19.920 --> 37:22.360
 or what I call adaptive plasticity.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.000
 A lot of plasticity can be induced,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.440
 for instance, by brain damage,

37:25.440 --> 37:27.240
 but that's generally not the kind of plasticity

37:27.240 --> 37:28.160
 that we want.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.840
 So when I say plasticity, unless I say otherwise,

37:30.840 --> 37:32.680
 I mean adaptive plasticity.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.680
 And in particular, most of the neuroplasticity

37:35.680 --> 37:38.600
 that people want is self-directed plasticity

37:38.600 --> 37:41.440
 because if there's one truism to neuroplasticity,

37:41.440 --> 37:45.680
 it's that from birth until about age 25,

37:45.680 --> 37:47.640
 the brain is incredibly plastic.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.660
 Kids are learning all sorts of things,

37:49.660 --> 37:51.380
 but they can learn it passively.

37:51.380 --> 37:54.800
 They don't have to work too hard or focus too hard,

37:54.800 --> 37:57.720
 although focus helps, to learn new things,

37:57.720 --> 38:00.120
 acquire new languages, acquire new skills.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.080
 But if you're an adult

38:01.080 --> 38:03.280
 and you want to change your neural circuitry

38:03.280 --> 38:05.740
 at the level of emotions or behavior or thoughts

38:05.740 --> 38:07.340
 or anything really,

38:07.340 --> 38:11.400
 you absolutely need to ask two important questions.

38:11.400 --> 38:16.400
 One, what particular aspect of my nervous system

38:16.560 --> 38:18.360
 am I trying to change?

38:18.360 --> 38:20.440
 Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions

38:20.440 --> 38:22.480
 or my perceptions, my sensations,

38:22.480 --> 38:24.840
 and which ones are available for me to change?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.600
 And then the second question is,

38:26.600 --> 38:28.260
 how are you going to go about that?

38:28.260 --> 38:31.680
 What is the structure of a regimen

38:31.680 --> 38:33.360
 to engage neuroplasticity?

38:33.360 --> 38:36.380
 And it turns out that the answer to that second question

38:36.380 --> 38:40.080
 is governed by how awake or how sleepy we are.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.620
 So let's talk about that next.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.500
 Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections

38:44.500 --> 38:47.640
 in the brain and body to change in response to experience.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.800
 And what's so incredible

38:48.800 --> 38:51.020
 about the human nervous system in particular

38:51.020 --> 38:54.100
 is that we can direct our own neural changes.

38:54.100 --> 38:57.440
 We can decide that we want to change our brain.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.520
 In other words, our brain can change itself

38:59.520 --> 39:01.400
 and our nervous system can change itself.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.280
 And the same can't be said for other organs of the body.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.140
 Even though our other organs of the body

39:06.140 --> 39:10.000
 have some ability to change, they can't direct it.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.420
 They can't think and decide,

39:11.420 --> 39:12.820
 oh, you know, your gut doesn't say,

39:12.820 --> 39:15.500
 oh, you know, I want to be able to digest spicy foods better.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.480
 So I'm going to rearrange the connections

39:17.480 --> 39:18.360
 to be able to do that.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.120
 Whereas your brain can decide

39:20.120 --> 39:21.660
 that you want to learn a language

39:21.660 --> 39:24.040
 or you want to be less emotionally reactive

39:24.040 --> 39:25.740
 or more emotionally engaged.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.040
 And you can undergo a series of steps

39:28.040 --> 39:31.020
 that will allow your brain to make those changes

39:31.020 --> 39:34.180
 so that eventually it becomes reflexive for you to do that,

39:34.180 --> 39:36.060
 which is absolutely incredible.

39:37.120 --> 39:40.300
 For a long time, it was thought that neuroplasticity

39:40.300 --> 39:43.360
 was the unique gift of young animals and humans,

39:43.360 --> 39:45.140
 that it could only occur when we're young.

39:45.140 --> 39:48.120
 And in fact, the young brain is incredibly plastic.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.920
 Children can learn three languages

39:49.920 --> 39:52.120
 without an accent reflexively,

39:52.120 --> 39:54.760
 whereas adults, it's very challenging.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.440
 It takes a lot more effort and strain,

39:56.440 --> 39:59.160
 a lot more of that duration path outcome kind of thinking

39:59.160 --> 40:01.720
 in order to achieve those plastic changes.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.360
 We now know, however, that the adult brain can change

40:06.360 --> 40:08.200
 in response to experience.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.840
 Nobel prizes were given for the understanding

40:11.840 --> 40:14.360
 that the young brain can change very dramatically.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.020
 I think one of the most extreme examples would be

40:17.020 --> 40:19.980
 for people that are born blind from birth,

40:19.980 --> 40:21.460
 they use the area of their brain

40:21.460 --> 40:24.640
 that normally would be used for visualizing objects

40:24.640 --> 40:28.180
 and colors and things outside of them for braille reading.

40:28.180 --> 40:31.200
 In brain imaging studies, it's been shown that, you know,

40:31.200 --> 40:33.400
 people who are blind from birth, when they braille read,

40:33.400 --> 40:36.760
 the area of the brain that would normally light up,

40:36.760 --> 40:40.960
 if you will, for vision, lights up for braille reading.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.560
 So that real estate is reallocated

40:43.560 --> 40:45.300
 for an entirely different function.

40:45.300 --> 40:49.560
 If someone is made blind in adulthood,

40:49.560 --> 40:52.080
 it's unlikely that their entire visual brain

40:52.080 --> 40:55.500
 will be taken over by the areas of the brain

40:55.500 --> 40:56.840
 they're responsible for touch.

40:56.840 --> 41:00.180
 However, there's some evidence that areas of the brain

41:00.180 --> 41:01.580
 that are involved in hearing and touch

41:01.580 --> 41:04.140
 can kind of migrate into that area.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.500
 And there's a lot of interest now in trying to figure out

41:06.500 --> 41:10.060
 how more plasticity can be induced in adulthood,

41:10.060 --> 41:12.380
 more positive plasticity.

41:12.380 --> 41:15.620
 And in order to understand that process,

41:15.620 --> 41:17.540
 we really have to understand something

41:17.540 --> 41:19.540
 that might at first seem totally divorced

41:19.540 --> 41:20.880
 from neuroplasticity,

41:20.880 --> 41:23.900
 but actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.420
 And for any of you that are interested

41:25.420 --> 41:27.020
 in changing your nervous system

41:27.020 --> 41:28.940
 so that something that you want

41:28.940 --> 41:30.780
 can go from being very hard

41:30.780 --> 41:33.020
 or seem almost impossible and out of reach

41:33.020 --> 41:34.900
 to being very reflexive,

41:34.900 --> 41:37.660
 this is especially important to pay attention to.

41:39.380 --> 41:42.140
 Plasticity in the adult human nervous system

41:42.140 --> 41:47.140
 is gated, meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.620
 These things that we talked about earlier,

41:49.620 --> 41:51.660
 dopamine, serotonin,

41:51.660 --> 41:54.260
 and one in particular called acetylcholine

41:55.320 --> 41:57.940
 are what open up plasticity.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.200
 They literally unveil plasticity

42:00.200 --> 42:01.640
 and allow brief periods of time

42:01.640 --> 42:03.700
 in which whatever information,

42:03.700 --> 42:07.180
 whatever thing we're sensing or perceiving or thinking,

42:07.180 --> 42:09.020
 whatever emotions we feel

42:09.020 --> 42:11.260
 can literally be mapped in the brain

42:11.260 --> 42:14.240
 such that later it will become much easier

42:14.240 --> 42:16.920
 for us to experience and feel that thing.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.920
 Now this has a dark side and a positive side.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.240
 The dark side is it's actually very easy

42:22.240 --> 42:24.540
 to get neuroplasticity as an adult

42:24.540 --> 42:28.380
 through traumatic or terrible or challenging experiences.

42:28.380 --> 42:31.720
 But the important question is to say, why is that?

42:31.720 --> 42:33.660
 And the reason that's the case

42:33.660 --> 42:37.260
 is because when something very bad happens,

42:37.260 --> 42:40.220
 there's the release of two sets of neuromodulators

42:40.220 --> 42:41.620
 in the brain,

42:41.620 --> 42:45.260
 epinephrine, which tends to make us feel alert and agitated,

42:45.260 --> 42:48.180
 which is associated with most bad circumstances,

42:48.180 --> 42:50.780
 and acetylcholine, which tends to create

42:50.780 --> 42:55.060
 a even more intense and focused perceptual spotlight.

42:55.060 --> 42:57.180
 Remember earlier we were talking about perception

42:57.180 --> 42:58.820
 and how it's kind of like a spotlight.

42:58.820 --> 43:01.480
 Acetylcholine makes that light particularly bright

43:01.480 --> 43:06.100
 and particularly restricted to one region of our experience.

43:06.100 --> 43:09.660
 And it does that by making certain neurons in our brain

43:09.660 --> 43:14.660
 and body active much more than all the rest.

43:14.660 --> 43:18.180
 So acetylcholine is sort of like a highlighter marker

43:18.180 --> 43:21.780
 upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later

43:21.780 --> 43:23.820
 and says, wait, which neurons were active

43:23.820 --> 43:27.260
 in this particularly alerting phase

43:27.260 --> 43:29.380
 of whatever day or night,

43:29.380 --> 43:30.800
 whenever this thing happened to happen.

43:30.800 --> 43:31.900
 So the way it works is this,

43:31.900 --> 43:35.320
 you can think of epinephrine as creating this alertness

43:35.320 --> 43:38.980
 and this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention

43:38.980 --> 43:40.660
 compared to what you were experiencing before.

43:40.660 --> 43:44.880
 And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule

43:44.880 --> 43:47.660
 that highlights whatever happens

43:47.660 --> 43:50.440
 during that period of heightened alertness.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.080
 So just to be clear,

43:52.080 --> 43:54.760
 it's epinephrine creates the alertness

43:54.760 --> 43:56.820
 that's coming from a subset of neurons in the brainstem

43:56.820 --> 43:57.940
 if you're interested,

43:57.940 --> 44:00.920
 and acetylcholine coming from an area of the forebrain

44:01.800 --> 44:04.620
 is tagging or marking the neurons

44:04.620 --> 44:06.000
 that are particularly active

44:06.000 --> 44:09.360
 during this heightened level of alertness.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.100
 Now that marks the cells,

44:11.100 --> 44:14.500
 the neurons and the synapses for strengthening,

44:14.500 --> 44:18.540
 for becoming more likely to be active in the future,

44:18.540 --> 44:21.760
 even without us thinking about it, okay?

44:21.760 --> 44:24.300
 So in bad circumstances,

44:24.300 --> 44:27.600
 this all happens without us having to do much.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.040
 When we want something to happen, however,

44:30.040 --> 44:31.540
 we wanna learn a new language,

44:31.540 --> 44:33.180
 we want to learn a new skill,

44:33.180 --> 44:35.360
 we wanna become more motivated.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.520
 What do we know for certain?

44:36.520 --> 44:40.320
 We know that that process of getting neuroplasticity

44:40.320 --> 44:42.480
 so that we have more focus, more motivation,

44:42.480 --> 44:46.740
 absolutely requires the release of epinephrine.

44:46.740 --> 44:50.080
 We have to have alertness in order to have focus,

44:50.080 --> 44:51.880
 and we have to have focus

44:51.880 --> 44:54.800
 in order to direct those plastic changes

44:54.800 --> 44:57.680
 to particular parts of our nervous system.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.600
 Now this has immense implications

45:00.600 --> 45:03.200
 in thinking about the various tools,

45:03.200 --> 45:06.520
 whether or not those are chemical tools or machine tools,

45:06.520 --> 45:10.100
 or just self-induced regimens of how long

45:10.100 --> 45:11.800
 or how intensely you're going to focus

45:11.800 --> 45:13.840
 in order to get neuroplasticity.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.100
 But there's another side to it.

45:18.100 --> 45:19.920
 The dirty secret of neuroplasticity

45:19.920 --> 45:22.600
 is that no neuroplasticity occurs

45:22.600 --> 45:24.760
 during the thing you're trying to learn,

45:24.760 --> 45:28.580
 during the terrible event, during the great event,

45:28.580 --> 45:31.140
 during the thing that you're really trying to shape

45:31.140 --> 45:34.320
 and learn nothing is actually changing

45:34.320 --> 45:37.160
 between the neurons that is going to last.

45:37.160 --> 45:41.600
 All the neuroplasticity, the strengthening of the synapses,

45:41.600 --> 45:44.620
 the addition in some cases of new nerve cells,

45:44.620 --> 45:47.440
 or at least connections between nerve cells,

45:47.440 --> 45:50.900
 all of that occurs at a very different phase of life,

45:50.900 --> 45:54.880
 which is when we are in sleep and non-sleep deep rest.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.280
 And so neuroplasticity,

45:56.280 --> 45:59.440
 which is the kind of holy grail of human experience of,

45:59.440 --> 46:00.460
 you know, this is the new year

46:00.460 --> 46:02.280
 and everyone's thinking new year's resolutions.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.920
 And right now, perhaps everything's organized

46:04.920 --> 46:06.400
 and people are highly motivated,

46:06.400 --> 46:09.160
 but what happens in March or April or May?

46:09.160 --> 46:12.460
 Well, that all depends on how much attention and focus

46:12.460 --> 46:14.200
 one can continually bring

46:14.200 --> 46:16.080
 to whatever it is they're trying to learn.

46:16.080 --> 46:19.320
 So much so that agitation and a feeling of strain

46:19.320 --> 46:23.400
 are actually required for this process of neuroplasticity

46:23.400 --> 46:24.640
 to get triggered.

46:24.640 --> 46:27.540
 But the actual rewiring occurs during periods of sleep

46:27.540 --> 46:30.640
 and non-sleep deep rest.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.020
 There's a study published last year

46:32.020 --> 46:35.280
 that's particularly relevant here that I wanna share,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.300
 was not done by my laboratory,

46:37.300 --> 46:41.280
 that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,

46:41.280 --> 46:42.920
 this is not deep sleep,

46:42.920 --> 46:46.840
 but essentially doing something very hard and very intense,

46:46.840 --> 46:49.160
 and then taking 20 minutes afterwards,

46:49.160 --> 46:50.520
 immediately afterwards,

46:50.520 --> 46:54.540
 to deliberately turn off the deliberate focused thinking

46:54.540 --> 46:58.460
 and engagement actually accelerated neuroplasticity.

46:58.460 --> 47:00.680
 There's another study that's just incredible,

47:00.680 --> 47:03.040
 and we're gonna go into this in a future episode

47:03.040 --> 47:05.160
 of the podcast, Not Too Long From Now,

47:05.160 --> 47:10.160
 that showed that if people are learning a particular skill,

47:10.160 --> 47:12.800
 it could be a language skill or a motor skill,

47:12.800 --> 47:16.480
 and they hear a tone just playing in the background,

47:16.480 --> 47:18.520
 the tone is playing periodically through the background,

47:18.520 --> 47:23.520
 like just a bell, in deep sleep, if that bell is played,

47:24.560 --> 47:26.700
 learning is much faster for the thing

47:26.700 --> 47:29.200
 that they were learning while they were awake.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.840
 It somehow cues the nervous system in sleep,

47:32.840 --> 47:34.560
 it doesn't even have to be in dreaming,

47:34.560 --> 47:38.000
 that something that happened in the waking phase

47:38.000 --> 47:39.480
 was especially important,

47:39.480 --> 47:43.600
 so much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue,

47:43.600 --> 47:46.320
 it's sort of a reminder to the sleeping brain,

47:46.320 --> 47:48.600
 oh, you need to remember what it is that you were learning

47:48.600 --> 47:49.680
 at that particular time of day,

47:49.680 --> 47:52.840
 and the learning rates and the rates of retention,

47:52.840 --> 47:54.220
 meaning how much people can remember

47:54.220 --> 47:55.400
 from the thing they learned,

47:55.400 --> 47:58.820
 are significantly higher under those conditions.

47:58.820 --> 48:01.520
 So I'm gonna talk about how to apply all this knowledge

48:01.520 --> 48:04.100
 in a little bit more in this podcast episode,

48:04.100 --> 48:05.920
 but also in future episodes,

48:05.920 --> 48:10.160
 but it really speaks to the really key importance

48:10.160 --> 48:12.600
 of sleep and focus,

48:12.600 --> 48:15.760
 these two opposite ends of our attentional state.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.760
 When we're in sleep, these DPOs,

48:17.760 --> 48:20.400
 duration, path, and outcome analysis are impossible,

48:20.400 --> 48:21.800
 we just can't do that,

48:21.800 --> 48:25.420
 we are only in relation to what's happening inside of us.

48:25.420 --> 48:27.380
 So sleep is key,

48:27.380 --> 48:30.080
 also key are periods of non-sleep deep rest

48:30.080 --> 48:31.960
 where we're turning off our analysis

48:31.960 --> 48:33.580
 of duration, path, and outcome,

48:33.580 --> 48:35.160
 in particular for the thing

48:35.160 --> 48:37.240
 that we were just trying to learn,

48:37.240 --> 48:40.240
 and we're in this kind of liminal state

48:40.240 --> 48:42.480
 where our attention is kind of drifting all over,

48:42.480 --> 48:45.120
 it turns out that's very important for the consolidation,

48:45.120 --> 48:47.360
 for the changes between the nerve cells

48:47.360 --> 48:49.580
 that will allow what we were trying to learn

48:49.580 --> 48:53.120
 to go from being deliberate and hard and stressful

48:53.120 --> 48:57.280
 and a strain to easy and reflexive.

48:58.140 --> 49:01.240
 This also points to how different people,

49:01.240 --> 49:03.120
 including many modern clinicians,

49:03.120 --> 49:05.840
 are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances,

49:05.840 --> 49:07.680
 traumas from routing their way

49:07.680 --> 49:09.280
 into our nervous system permanently.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.540
 It says that you might wanna interfere

49:11.540 --> 49:14.180
 with certain aspects of brain states

49:14.180 --> 49:17.520
 that are away from the bad thing that happened,

49:17.520 --> 49:19.560
 the brain states that happened the next day

49:19.560 --> 49:21.800
 or the next month or the next year.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.760
 And also I wanna make sure

49:24.760 --> 49:27.220
 that I pay attention to the fact that for many of you,

49:27.220 --> 49:28.600
 you're thinking about neuroplasticity,

49:28.600 --> 49:30.880
 not just in changing your nervous system

49:30.880 --> 49:32.360
 to add something new,

49:32.360 --> 49:35.880
 but to also get rid of things that you don't like, right?

49:35.880 --> 49:38.080
 That you wanna forget bad experiences

49:38.080 --> 49:40.500
 or at least remove the emotional contingency

49:40.500 --> 49:41.920
 of a bad relationship

49:41.920 --> 49:45.020
 or a bad relationship to some thing or some person

49:45.020 --> 49:49.340
 or some event, learning to fear certain things less,

49:49.340 --> 49:52.760
 to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma.

49:52.760 --> 49:54.980
 The memories themselves don't get erased.

49:54.980 --> 49:57.760
 I'm sorry to say that the memories themselves get erased,

49:57.760 --> 50:00.640
 but the emotional load of memories can be reduced.

50:00.640 --> 50:01.920
 And there are a number of different ways

50:01.920 --> 50:03.180
 that that can happen,

50:03.180 --> 50:04.640
 but they all require this thing

50:04.640 --> 50:07.520
 that we're calling neuroplasticity.

50:07.520 --> 50:09.920
 We're gonna have a large number of discussions

50:09.920 --> 50:12.020
 about neuroplasticity in depth.

50:12.020 --> 50:14.440
 But the most important thing to understand

50:14.440 --> 50:17.420
 is that it is indeed a two-phase process.

50:17.420 --> 50:21.240
 What governs the transition between alert and focused

50:21.240 --> 50:24.800
 and these deep rest and deep sleep states

50:24.800 --> 50:27.240
 is a system in our brain and body,

50:27.240 --> 50:28.860
 a certain aspect of the nervous system

50:28.860 --> 50:31.600
 called the autonomic nervous system.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.800
 And it is immensely important to understand

50:33.800 --> 50:36.240
 how this autonomic nervous system works.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.400
 It has names like the sympathetic nervous system

50:38.400 --> 50:39.720
 and parasympathetic nervous system,

50:39.720 --> 50:42.400
 which frankly are complicated names

50:42.400 --> 50:43.760
 because they're a little bit misleading.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.580
 Sympathetic is the one that's associated

50:45.580 --> 50:46.420
 with more alertness.

50:46.420 --> 50:48.080
 Parasympathetic is the one that's associated

50:48.080 --> 50:49.760
 with more calmness.

50:49.760 --> 50:51.120
 And it gets really misleading

50:51.120 --> 50:54.340
 because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy

50:54.340 --> 50:55.880
 and then people think it's related to calm.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.440
 I'm gonna call it the alertness system

50:57.440 --> 50:59.200
 and the calmness system,

50:59.200 --> 51:02.680
 because even though sympathetic and parasympathetic

51:02.680 --> 51:05.400
 are sometimes used, people really get confused.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.700
 So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system

51:08.700 --> 51:11.940
 and the reason it's important for every aspect of your life,

51:11.940 --> 51:13.920
 but in particular for neuroplasticity

51:13.920 --> 51:15.960
 and engaging in these focused states

51:15.960 --> 51:17.620
 and then these defocused states

51:17.620 --> 51:19.880
 is that it works sort of like a seesaw.

51:19.880 --> 51:23.000
 Every 24 hours, we're all familiar with the fact

51:23.000 --> 51:24.180
 that when we wake up in the morning,

51:24.180 --> 51:25.320
 we might be a little bit groggy,

51:25.320 --> 51:26.960
 but then generally we're more alert.

51:26.960 --> 51:29.140
 And then as evening comes around,

51:29.140 --> 51:31.200
 we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleepy.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.640
 And eventually at some point at night, we go to sleep.

51:33.640 --> 51:36.880
 So we go from alert to deeply calm.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.800
 And as we do that, we go from an ability

51:38.800 --> 51:41.120
 to engage in these very focused

51:41.120 --> 51:43.560
 duration path outcome types of analysis

51:43.560 --> 51:46.800
 to states in sleep that are completely divorced

51:46.800 --> 51:48.480
 from duration path and outcome

51:48.480 --> 51:50.840
 in which everything is completely random and untethered

51:50.840 --> 51:52.640
 in terms of our sensations, perceptions

51:52.640 --> 51:54.040
 and feelings and so forth.

51:54.040 --> 51:57.500
 So every 24 hours, we have a phase of our day

51:57.500 --> 52:01.220
 that is optimal for thinking and focusing

52:01.220 --> 52:03.400
 and learning and neuroplasticity

52:03.400 --> 52:04.760
 and doing all sorts of things.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.640
 We have energy as well.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.800
 And at another phase of our day, we're tired

52:08.800 --> 52:11.360
 and we have no ability to focus.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.960
 We have no ability to engage in duration path

52:13.960 --> 52:15.800
 outcome types of analysis.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.920
 And it's interesting that both phases are important

52:19.920 --> 52:22.600
 for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.560
 So if we want to engage in neuroplasticity

52:24.560 --> 52:27.260
 and we want to get the most out of our nervous system,

52:27.260 --> 52:30.680
 we each have to master that both the transition

52:30.680 --> 52:32.800
 between wakefulness and sleep

52:32.800 --> 52:35.480
 and the transition between sleep and wakefulness.

52:35.480 --> 52:37.900
 Now, so much has been made of the importance of sleep.

52:37.900 --> 52:40.520
 And it is critically important for wound healing,

52:40.520 --> 52:42.040
 for learning, as I just mentioned,

52:42.040 --> 52:44.000
 for consolidating learning,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.340
 for all aspects of our immune system.

52:47.340 --> 52:48.480
 It is the one period of time

52:48.480 --> 52:50.140
 in which we're not doing these duration path

52:50.140 --> 52:51.720
 and outcomes types of analyses.

52:51.720 --> 52:54.160
 And it is critically important to all aspects of our health,

52:54.160 --> 52:55.560
 including our longevity.

52:56.960 --> 52:59.100
 Much less has been made, however,

52:59.100 --> 53:01.800
 of how to get better at sleeping,

53:01.800 --> 53:03.760
 how to get better at the process

53:03.760 --> 53:06.640
 that involves falling asleep, staying asleep,

53:06.640 --> 53:10.060
 and accessing these states of mind and body

53:10.060 --> 53:11.720
 that involve total paralysis.

53:11.720 --> 53:12.560
 Most people don't know this,

53:12.560 --> 53:14.900
 but you're actually paralyzed during much of your sleep

53:14.900 --> 53:17.520
 so that you can't act out your dreams, presumably.

53:17.520 --> 53:21.800
 But also where your brain is in a total idle state

53:21.800 --> 53:24.000
 where it's not controlling anything,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.060
 it's just left to kind of free run.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.880
 And there are certain things that we can all do

53:29.880 --> 53:32.400
 in order to master that transition,

53:32.400 --> 53:34.360
 in order to get better at sleeping.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.680
 And it involves much more than just how much we sleep.

53:36.680 --> 53:37.920
 We're all being told, of course,

53:37.920 --> 53:39.400
 that we need to sleep more,

53:39.400 --> 53:41.760
 but there's also the issue of sleep quality,

53:41.760 --> 53:45.320
 accessing those deep states of non-DPO thinking,

53:45.320 --> 53:48.080
 accessing the right timing of sleep.

53:48.080 --> 53:49.800
 Not a lot has been discussed publicly,

53:49.800 --> 53:52.560
 as far as I'm aware, of when to time your sleep.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.380
 I think we all can appreciate that sleeping

53:55.380 --> 53:57.840
 for half an hour throughout the day

53:57.840 --> 54:00.960
 so that you get a total of eight hours of sleep

54:00.960 --> 54:04.040
 every 24 hour cycle is probably very different

54:04.040 --> 54:06.220
 and not optimal compared to a solid block

54:06.220 --> 54:07.340
 of eight hours of sleep.

54:07.340 --> 54:08.880
 Although there are people that have tried this.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.800
 I think it's been written about in various books.

54:11.800 --> 54:14.460
 Not many people can stick to that schedule.

54:14.460 --> 54:16.560
 Incidentally, I think it's called the Uberman schedule,

54:16.560 --> 54:19.040
 not to be confused with the Huberman schedule,

54:19.040 --> 54:19.860
 because first of all,

54:19.860 --> 54:21.280
 my schedule doesn't look anything like that.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.120
 And second of all,

54:22.120 --> 54:24.500
 I would never attempt such a sleeping regime.

54:25.640 --> 54:28.840
 The other thing that is really important to understand

54:28.840 --> 54:32.840
 is that we have not explored as a culture

54:32.840 --> 54:35.840
 the rhythms that occur in our waking states.

54:35.840 --> 54:38.240
 So much has been focused on the value of sleep

54:38.240 --> 54:40.440
 and the importance of sleep, which is great,

54:40.440 --> 54:42.920
 but I don't think that most people are paying attention

54:42.920 --> 54:44.740
 to what's happening in their waking states

54:44.740 --> 54:47.520
 and when their brain is optimized for focus,

54:47.520 --> 54:49.880
 when their brain is optimized for these DPOs,

54:49.880 --> 54:53.120
 these duration path outcome types of engagements

54:53.120 --> 54:55.200
 for learning and for changing,

54:55.200 --> 54:57.320
 and when their brain is probably better suited

54:57.320 --> 54:59.520
 for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.840
 And it turns out

55:00.840 --> 55:03.760
 that there's a vast amount of scientific data

55:04.920 --> 55:06.360
 which points to the existence

55:06.360 --> 55:08.460
 of what are called ultradian rhythms.

55:08.460 --> 55:10.760
 You may have heard of circadian rhythms.

55:10.760 --> 55:13.640
 Circadian means circa about a day.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.120
 So it's 24 hour rhythms

55:15.120 --> 55:18.080
 because the earth spins once every 24 hours.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.640
 Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day

55:21.960 --> 55:24.640
 and they require less time, they're shorter.

55:24.640 --> 55:26.120
 The most important ultradian rhythm

55:26.120 --> 55:28.640
 for sake of this discussion is the 90 minute rhythm

55:28.640 --> 55:31.000
 that we're going through all the time

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
 in our ability to attend and focus.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.400
 And in sleep, our sleep is broken up

55:37.400 --> 55:39.500
 into 90 minute segments.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.340
 Early in the night,

55:40.340 --> 55:42.960
 we have more phase one and phase two lighter sleep

55:42.960 --> 55:44.560
 and then we go into our deeper phase three

55:44.560 --> 55:45.400
 and phase four sleep

55:45.400 --> 55:47.520
 and then we return to phase one, two, three, four.

55:47.520 --> 55:50.180
 So all night you're going through these ultradian rhythms

55:50.180 --> 55:53.360
 of stage one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

55:53.360 --> 55:54.940
 it's repeating.

55:54.940 --> 55:57.720
 Most people perhaps know that, maybe they don't,

55:57.720 --> 56:00.120
 but when you wake up in the morning,

56:00.120 --> 56:02.280
 these ultradian rhythms continue.

56:02.280 --> 56:04.480
 And it turns out that we are optimized

56:04.480 --> 56:08.500
 for focus and attention within these 90 minute cycles

56:08.500 --> 56:10.800
 so that at the beginning of one of these 90 minute cycles,

56:10.800 --> 56:12.480
 maybe you sit down to learn something new

56:12.480 --> 56:15.720
 or to engage in some new challenging behavior.

56:15.720 --> 56:18.160
 For the first five or 10 minutes of one of those cycles,

56:18.160 --> 56:20.800
 it's well known that the brain and the neural circuits

56:20.800 --> 56:24.840
 and the neuromodulators are not gonna be optimally tuned

56:24.840 --> 56:26.080
 to whatever it is you're trying to do.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.560
 But as you drop deeper into that 90 minute cycle,

56:28.560 --> 56:32.240
 your ability to focus and to engage in this DPO process

56:32.240 --> 56:35.280
 and to direct neural plasticity and to learn

56:35.280 --> 56:36.700
 is actually much greater.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.180
 And then you eventually pop out of that

56:39.180 --> 56:41.060
 at the end of the 90 minute cycle.

56:41.060 --> 56:43.120
 So these cycles are occurring in sleep

56:43.120 --> 56:45.300
 and these cycles are occurring in wakefulness.

56:45.300 --> 56:47.960
 And all of those are governed by this seesaw

56:47.960 --> 56:49.320
 of alertness to calmness

56:49.320 --> 56:51.620
 that we call the autonomic nervous system.

56:51.620 --> 56:55.340
 So if you want to master and control your nervous system,

56:55.340 --> 56:57.400
 regardless of what tool you reach to,

56:57.400 --> 56:59.040
 whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool

56:59.040 --> 57:00.640
 or whether or not it's a behavioral tool

57:00.640 --> 57:03.980
 or whether or not it's a brain machine interface tool,

57:03.980 --> 57:06.560
 it's vitally important to understand

57:06.560 --> 57:08.800
 that your entire existence

57:08.800 --> 57:11.140
 is occurring in these 90 minute cycles,

57:11.140 --> 57:13.000
 whether or not you're asleep or awake.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.520
 And so you really need to learn

57:14.520 --> 57:17.600
 how to wedge into those 90 minute cycles.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.880
 And for instance, it would be completely crazy

57:20.880 --> 57:24.040
 and counterproductive to try and just learn information

57:24.040 --> 57:26.320
 while in deep sleep by listening to that information

57:26.320 --> 57:28.440
 because you're not able to access it.

57:28.440 --> 57:31.320
 It would be perfectly good, however,

57:31.320 --> 57:34.200
 to engage in a focus bout of learning each day.

57:34.200 --> 57:35.440
 And now we know how long

57:35.440 --> 57:37.120
 that focus bout of learning should be.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.360
 It should be at least one 90 minute cycle.

57:39.360 --> 57:42.120
 And the expectation should be that the early phase

57:42.120 --> 57:44.260
 of that cycle is going to be challenging.

57:44.260 --> 57:45.100
 It's going to hurt.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.280
 It's not going to feel natural.

57:46.280 --> 57:48.180
 It's not going to feel like flow,

57:48.180 --> 57:49.900
 but that you can learn

57:49.900 --> 57:51.280
 and the circuits of your brain

57:51.280 --> 57:53.160
 that are involved in focus and motivation

57:53.160 --> 57:56.780
 can learn to drop in to a mode of more focus,

57:56.780 --> 57:59.360
 get more neuroplasticity, in other words,

57:59.360 --> 58:02.080
 by engaging these ultradian cycles

58:02.080 --> 58:04.320
 at the appropriate times of day.

58:04.320 --> 58:06.500
 For instance, some people are very good learners

58:06.500 --> 58:09.080
 early in the day and not so good in the afternoon.

58:09.080 --> 58:11.840
 So you can start to explore this process

58:11.840 --> 58:13.640
 even without any information

58:13.640 --> 58:15.060
 about the underlying neurochemicals

58:15.060 --> 58:16.880
 by simply paying attention,

58:16.880 --> 58:18.320
 not just to when you go to sleep

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
 and when you wake up each morning,

58:20.320 --> 58:24.020
 how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively,

58:24.020 --> 58:25.320
 but also throughout the day

58:25.320 --> 58:28.440
 when your brain tends to be most anxious,

58:28.440 --> 58:30.820
 because it turns out that has a correlate

58:30.820 --> 58:34.800
 related to perception that we will talk about.

58:34.800 --> 58:37.180
 You can ask yourself, when are you most focused?

58:37.180 --> 58:38.320
 When are you least anxious?

58:38.320 --> 58:40.000
 When do you feel most motivated?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.920
 When do you feel least motivated?

58:42.920 --> 58:45.640
 By understanding how the different aspects

58:45.640 --> 58:47.800
 of your perception, sensation, feeling, thought,

58:47.800 --> 58:51.040
 and actions tend to want to be engaged

58:51.040 --> 58:52.460
 or not want to be engaged,

58:52.460 --> 58:54.920
 you develop a very good window

58:54.920 --> 58:56.600
 into what's going to be required

58:56.600 --> 58:59.560
 to shift your ability to focus

58:59.560 --> 59:03.320
 or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking

59:03.320 --> 59:05.760
 at different times of day, should you choose.

59:05.760 --> 59:07.860
 And so that's where we're heading going forward.

59:07.860 --> 59:10.660
 It all starts with mastering this seesaw

59:10.660 --> 59:12.440
 that is the autonomic nervous system

59:12.440 --> 59:14.800
 that at a course level is a transition

59:14.800 --> 59:16.800
 between wakefulness and sleep.

59:16.800 --> 59:19.520
 But at a finer level, and just as important

59:19.520 --> 59:20.560
 are the various cycles,

59:20.560 --> 59:22.200
 these ultradian 90 minute cycles

59:22.200 --> 59:24.200
 that govern our life all the time,

59:24.200 --> 59:26.440
 24 hours a day, every day of our life.

59:26.440 --> 59:27.540
 And so we're going to talk about

59:27.540 --> 59:30.080
 how you can take control of the autonomic nervous system

59:30.080 --> 59:33.080
 so that you can better access neuroplasticity,

59:33.080 --> 59:34.760
 better access sleep,

59:34.760 --> 59:36.680
 even take advantage of the phase

59:36.680 --> 59:38.880
 that is the transition between sleep and waking

59:38.880 --> 59:42.520
 to access things like creativity and so forth.

59:42.520 --> 59:44.880
 All based on studies that have been published

59:44.880 --> 59:46.020
 over the last hundred years,

59:46.020 --> 59:47.680
 mainly within the last 10 years

59:47.680 --> 59:49.320
 and some that are very, very new

59:49.320 --> 59:51.640
 and that point to the use of specific tools

59:51.640 --> 59:53.400
 that will allow you to get the most

59:53.400 --> 59:55.120
 out of your nervous system.

59:55.120 --> 59:57.640
 So today we covered a lot of information.

59:57.640 --> 59:59.420
 It was sort of a whirlwind tour

59:59.420 --> 1:00:01.760
 of everything from neurons and synapses

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:04.460
 to neuroplasticity in the autonomic nervous system.

1:00:04.460 --> 1:00:07.220
 We will revisit a lot of these themes going forward.

1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:10.560
 So if all of that didn't sink in in one pass,

1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:11.440
 please don't worry.

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:14.440
 We will come back to these themes over and over again.

1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:16.960
 I wanted to equip you with a language

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:20.280
 that we're all developing a kind of common base set

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:22.200
 of information going forward.

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:24.200
 And I hope the information is valuable to you

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.320
 in your thinking about what is working well for you

1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:29.360
 and what's working less well

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.000
 and what's been exceedingly challenging

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.300
 and what's been easy for you

1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:34.840
 in terms of your pursuit of particular behaviors

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:36.300
 or emotional states,

1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:38.280
 where your challenges or the challenges of people

1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:40.680
 that you know might reside.

1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:42.700
 As promised in our welcome video,

1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:44.720
 the format of the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:47.000
 is to dive deep into individual topics

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.060
 for an entire month at a time.

1:00:49.060 --> 1:00:51.000
 So for the entire month of January,

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.160
 we're going to explore this incredible state that is sleep

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:58.980
 and a related state, which is non-sleep deep rest.

1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:01.940
 And what they do for things like learning,

1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:04.080
 resetting our emotional capacity.

1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:05.480
 Everyone's probably familiar with the fact

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:06.480
 that when we're sleep deprived,

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:10.960
 we're so much less good at dealing with life circumstances.

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:12.920
 We're more emotionally labile.

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:13.760
 Why is that?

1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:14.740
 How is that?

1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:15.580
 But most importantly,

1:01:15.580 --> 1:01:17.520
 we're going to talk about how to get better at sleeping

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:19.280
 and then how to access better sleep,

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:24.240
 even when your sleep timing or duration is compromised.

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:26.260
 We're also going to talk about the data

1:01:26.260 --> 1:01:29.000
 that support this very interesting state

1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.520
 called non-sleep deep rest,

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:34.140
 where one is neither asleep nor awake,

1:01:34.140 --> 1:01:36.160
 but it turns out one can recover

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:37.760
 some of the neuromodulators

1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:38.600
 and more importantly,

1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:41.600
 the processes involved in sensation, perception,

1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:43.020
 feeling, thought, and action.

1:01:43.020 --> 1:01:46.480
 It's sure to be a very rich discussion back and forth

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:49.420
 where I'm answering your questions and providing tools.

1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:51.320
 And I'm certain you're also going to learn

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:54.280
 a lot of information about neuroscience

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:57.180
 and what makes up this incredible phase of your life

1:01:57.180 --> 1:01:58.640
 where you think you're not conscious,

1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:02.240
 but you're actually resetting and renewing yourself

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:05.120
 in order to perform better, feel better, et cetera,

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:06.560
 in the waking state.

1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:08.060
