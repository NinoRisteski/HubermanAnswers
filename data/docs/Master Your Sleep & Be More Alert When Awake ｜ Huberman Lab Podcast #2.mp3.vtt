00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.260
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.260 --> 00:15.700
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.700 --> 00:19.060
 Today's podcast episode is all about sleep.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.020
 We're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep,

00:22.020 --> 00:23.820
 which is wakefulness.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.180
 Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness,

00:27.180 --> 00:31.580
 govern everything about our mental and physical health.

00:31.580 --> 00:33.160
 And we're not just gonna talk about

00:33.160 --> 00:35.140
 what's useful about sleep.

00:35.140 --> 00:38.100
 We're also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.840
 And that will include how to get better at falling asleep,

00:40.840 --> 00:44.920
 timing your sleep, and accessing better sleep quality.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.620
 In doing so, we're also gonna discuss

00:46.620 --> 00:50.780
 how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness.

00:50.780 --> 00:52.620
 So because sleep and wakefulness are related,

00:52.620 --> 00:53.960
 we really can't have a conversation

00:53.960 --> 00:56.060
 about one without the other.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.700
 Now, in keeping with this theme,

00:57.700 --> 01:01.020
 you may catch a few snores in the background.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.980
 Unlike me, my bulldog Costello

01:02.980 --> 01:04.900
 can fall asleep anywhere, anytime,

01:04.900 --> 01:07.180
 and he happens to be sleeping over there in the corner.

01:07.180 --> 01:10.320
 So if you hear snoring, that's what that's about.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.700
 As always, I wanna just mention that this podcast

01:12.700 --> 01:15.460
 is part of my effort to bring zero cost to consumer,

01:15.460 --> 01:19.260
 public education about science and science-related tools.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.820
 It is unrelated to my teaching and research roles

01:21.820 --> 01:23.180
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.260
 Today's podcast is brought to us by Helix Mattresses.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.240
 Having the proper sleep environment,

01:28.240 --> 01:29.980
 both the environment you're sleeping in

01:29.980 --> 01:31.820
 and the object you're sleeping on,

01:31.820 --> 01:34.660
 is critically important to getting a good night's sleep.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.120
 Helix Mattresses are a little different than most

01:37.120 --> 01:40.020
 because they're matched to your specific sleep needs,

01:40.020 --> 01:43.320
 as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or cold

01:43.320 --> 01:44.620
 as you sleep through the night,

01:44.620 --> 01:46.860
 what position you sleep in, and so forth.

01:46.860 --> 01:48.480
 So if you go to their website,

01:48.480 --> 01:49.780
 they have a quiz that you can take

01:49.780 --> 01:51.720
 that matches you to the particular mattress

01:51.720 --> 01:54.100
 that's gonna be best for your sleep needs.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.900
 I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.660
 I'm one of these people that can fall asleep easily,

01:57.660 --> 01:59.500
 but then I wake up and I have a hard time

01:59.500 --> 02:00.740
 getting back to sleep.

02:00.740 --> 02:02.840
 And once I switched to a Helix Mattress

02:02.840 --> 02:05.400
 that was precisely matched to my sleep needs,

02:05.400 --> 02:06.740
 I found I could sleep through the night,

02:06.740 --> 02:09.020
 which has made a tremendous difference for me.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.660
 If you wanna try Helix Mattresses,

02:10.660 --> 02:14.380
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

02:14.380 --> 02:17.460
 and that will give you up to $200 off on a mattress order,

02:17.460 --> 02:20.740
 as well as two pillows free with your mattress order.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.620
 And of course, having the proper pillows

02:22.620 --> 02:25.780
 is just as important as having the proper mattress.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.880
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.580
 Headspace is a meditation app

02:30.580 --> 02:32.860
 that teaches you how to meditate.

02:32.860 --> 02:35.500
 It's fair to say that now there's a ton of research out

02:35.500 --> 02:37.320
 there in peer-reviewed journals,

02:37.320 --> 02:39.560
 supporting the fact that mindfulness meditation

02:39.560 --> 02:42.600
 can support mental and physical health.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.620
 But many people find it hard to meditate.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.260
 In fact, I'm one of these people.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.740
 I started meditating in my teens,

02:47.740 --> 02:49.980
 but then I would drop it every few weeks or so,

02:49.980 --> 02:52.300
 and then I'd get back to it maybe the following week

02:52.300 --> 02:53.160
 or every year.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.900
 I just was not very regular about my meditation practice.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.540
 And then a few years ago, I was flying a lot for work

02:59.540 --> 03:01.020
 and I was on JetBlue flights,

03:01.020 --> 03:04.380
 and they have Headspace as part of the choice of things

03:04.380 --> 03:06.100
 that you can watch on the TV screen.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.780
 And as I started meditating more regularly,

03:07.780 --> 03:09.860
 what I found is my sleep was better,

03:09.860 --> 03:11.980
 I would arrive feeling more rested.

03:11.980 --> 03:14.940
 It just had tremendous effects on my work performance

03:14.940 --> 03:17.020
 and other aspects of my life.

03:17.020 --> 03:20.400
 If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com

03:20.400 --> 03:22.100
 slash special offer.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.300
 If you do that, you'll get one month

03:24.300 --> 03:27.100
 of all of Headspace's meditations for free.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.760
 That's the best offer right now.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.360
 So if interested, go to headspace.com slash special offer.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.180
 So let's talk about sleep.

03:35.180 --> 03:37.980
 Sleep is this incredible period of our lives

03:37.980 --> 03:40.320
 where we are not conscious.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.460
 We might dream, we might twitch, we might even wake up,

03:44.460 --> 03:47.180
 but in sleep, we are only in relation

03:47.180 --> 03:49.860
 to things that are happening within our brain and body.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.860
 Outside sensory experience, in most cases,

03:52.860 --> 03:54.820
 can't really impact us.

03:54.820 --> 03:58.100
 And yet sleep is this tremendously important period of life

03:58.100 --> 04:02.620
 because it resets our ability to be focused, alert,

04:02.620 --> 04:06.200
 and emotionally stable in the wakeful period.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.500
 So we can't really talk about wakefulness, focus,

04:09.500 --> 04:14.140
 motivation, mood, wellbeing without thinking about sleep.

04:14.140 --> 04:16.140
 And that's why we're devoting this entire month

04:16.140 --> 04:18.220
 to the discussion about sleep.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.700
 But we also can't talk about sleep and think about sleep

04:20.700 --> 04:22.340
 without thinking about wakefulness,

04:22.340 --> 04:26.100
 because it turns out that the period that we call sleep

04:26.100 --> 04:27.740
 and the period we call wakefulness

04:27.740 --> 04:29.660
 are tethered to one another.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.420
 What we do in the waking state determines

04:32.420 --> 04:35.880
 when we fall asleep, how quickly we fall asleep,

04:35.880 --> 04:37.820
 whether or not we stay asleep,

04:37.820 --> 04:40.500
 and how we feel when we wake up the next day.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.140
 And today, we're gonna talk mostly

04:43.140 --> 04:45.820
 about how to get better at sleeping.

04:45.820 --> 04:48.420
 And the reason for starting the conversation that way,

04:48.420 --> 04:52.460
 as opposed to just diving into a lot of biology about sleep,

04:52.460 --> 04:55.340
 is because first of all, there's a lot of information

04:55.340 --> 04:58.340
 out there already about the biology of sleep.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.740
 We're gonna touch on a little bit of this,

04:59.740 --> 05:02.740
 things like stages of sleep and sleep spindles,

05:02.740 --> 05:05.380
 melatonin, and dreaming.

05:05.380 --> 05:09.440
 But I think that by now, most people are aware

05:09.440 --> 05:11.360
 that getting a really good night's sleep

05:11.360 --> 05:14.540
 on a consistent basis is critically important.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.060
 But most people don't know how to do that.

05:17.060 --> 05:20.340
 In fact, I'm guessing that very few of you out there

05:20.340 --> 05:23.320
 are consistently getting seven to nine hours

05:23.320 --> 05:26.260
 of really terrific sleep, waking up feeling rested,

05:26.260 --> 05:27.900
 like you're ready to attack the day,

05:27.900 --> 05:30.100
 and being able to go through the day feeling focused

05:30.100 --> 05:33.560
 and alert without dips in energy or focus.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.880
 So if you're like most people, which includes me,

05:36.880 --> 05:38.740
 you have some challenges with sleep,

05:38.740 --> 05:41.080
 at least every third or fifth night or so,

05:41.080 --> 05:42.680
 and maybe even more often.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.540
 So we're really gonna go tool heavy today

05:44.540 --> 05:48.000
 and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.660
 sleep better, and emerge from sleep feeling more rested.

05:51.660 --> 05:54.300
 And we're gonna do that by grounding our discussion

05:54.300 --> 05:57.400
 of tools in peer-reviewed studies,

05:57.400 --> 05:59.300
 mostly from the last 10 years,

05:59.300 --> 06:01.500
 although some even more recent than that.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.080
 And we're gonna start by discussing what is sleep

06:05.080 --> 06:08.500
 and what governs the timing of the onset of sleep.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.540
 In other words, what makes you get sleepy

06:10.540 --> 06:12.500
 at a particular time of day.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.060
 So what determines how well we sleep

06:15.060 --> 06:18.180
 and the quality of our wakeful state?

06:18.180 --> 06:20.680
 Turns out that's governed by two forces.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.340
 The first force is a chemical force.

06:23.340 --> 06:25.580
 It's called adenosine.

06:25.580 --> 06:28.860
 Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body

06:28.860 --> 06:31.740
 that builds up the longer we are awake.

06:31.740 --> 06:35.020
 So if you've just slept for eight or nine or 10

06:35.020 --> 06:37.420
 really deep restful hours,

06:37.420 --> 06:40.860
 adenosine is gonna be very low in your brain and body.

06:40.860 --> 06:44.940
 If however you've been awake for 10, 15 or more hours,

06:44.940 --> 06:47.700
 adenosine levels are going to be much higher.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.460
 Adenosine creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.980
 And actually hunger is the appropriate word here

06:54.980 --> 06:57.860
 because for most of what we're gonna discuss today,

06:57.860 --> 07:01.380
 we can think of it in an analogous way to nutrition.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.340
 Your nutrition and how well you feel

07:04.340 --> 07:06.340
 after you eat certain foods,

07:06.340 --> 07:09.740
 your overall level of fitness and your cellular health

07:09.740 --> 07:13.100
 and your heart health isn't governed by any one food item

07:13.100 --> 07:14.600
 that you might eat or not eat.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.400
 It's governed by a number of different factors.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
 How often you eat, how much you eat,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.380
 which items you eat, et cetera,

07:20.380 --> 07:22.420
 and what works best for you.

07:22.420 --> 07:26.140
 In the same way, your sleep and your wakefulness

07:26.140 --> 07:28.860
 are the product of kind of the average

07:28.860 --> 07:30.700
 of a number of different behaviors.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.720
 How long you've been awake is a key one

07:32.720 --> 07:35.300
 because of this molecule adenosine.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.980
 So the reason you get sleepy

07:36.980 --> 07:37.940
 when you've been up for a while

07:37.940 --> 07:40.820
 is because adenosine is creeping up steadily

07:40.820 --> 07:42.620
 the longer you've been awake.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.900
 And a good way to remember this and think about adenosine

07:45.900 --> 07:48.340
 is to think about caffeine.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.240
 Caffeine for most people,

07:50.240 --> 07:53.300
 except a very small percentage of people, wakes them up.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.040
 It makes them feel more alert.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.740
 In fact, some people are so sensitive to caffeine

07:57.740 --> 08:00.180
 that they feel jittery if they drink it

08:00.180 --> 08:01.620
 even in small amounts.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.780
 Other people can drink large amounts of caffeine

08:03.780 --> 08:05.740
 and not feel jittery at all.

08:06.660 --> 08:11.260
 Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.

08:11.260 --> 08:14.220
 What that means is that when you ingest caffeine,

08:14.220 --> 08:16.400
 whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea

08:16.400 --> 08:20.720
 or in any other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.780
 It sort of parks there,

08:21.780 --> 08:24.500
 just like a car would park in a given parking slot,

08:24.500 --> 08:27.920
 and therefore adenosine can't park in that slot.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.200
 Now, when caffeine parks in the adenosine receptor slot,

08:31.200 --> 08:35.100
 nothing really happens downstream of that receptor.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.940
 The receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions

08:37.940 --> 08:41.520
 of making that cell and you feel sleepy.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.340
 So the reason caffeine wakes you up

08:44.340 --> 08:48.080
 is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.800
 It blocks the sleepy signal.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.520
 And this is why when that caffeine wears off,

08:52.520 --> 08:54.580
 adenosine will bind to that receptor,

08:54.580 --> 08:57.360
 sometimes with even greater, what we call affinity,

08:57.360 --> 09:01.060
 and you feel the crash, you feel especially tired.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.020
 Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.720
 I love caffeine.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.520
 I drink it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.560
 But I'm one of these people

09:08.560 --> 09:10.920
 that either because of my tolerance

09:10.920 --> 09:13.240
 or because of some genetic variations

09:13.240 --> 09:14.700
 that exist among people

09:14.700 --> 09:17.360
 in terms of their adenosine receptors,

09:17.360 --> 09:19.840
 I can drink caffeine as late as four or 5 p.m.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.700
 in the evening and still fall asleep just fine.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.360
 Some people can't have any caffeine at all

09:25.360 --> 09:27.720
 or can't have any caffeine past 11 a.m.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.000
 or else their sleep is totally disrupted.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.780
 All of this has to do with the relationship

09:32.780 --> 09:35.820
 between adenosine and these adenosine receptors,

09:35.820 --> 09:38.700
 genetic variation, things that are very hard to find out

09:38.700 --> 09:40.200
 except experimentally,

09:40.200 --> 09:42.120
 meaning each of you needs to decide

09:42.120 --> 09:43.820
 and figure out for yourselves

09:43.820 --> 09:45.640
 whether or not you can tolerate caffeine

09:45.640 --> 09:48.280
 and at what times of day you can tolerate caffeine

09:48.280 --> 09:52.280
 in order to still fall asleep easily and get good sleep.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.860
 So rather than demonize caffeine,

09:54.860 --> 09:58.760
 or say that everyone can drink caffeine until late,

09:58.760 --> 10:01.320
 you need to figure out what's right for you.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.160
 Caffeine has a lot of health benefits.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.280
 It also, for some people, can be problematic for health.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.400
 It can raise blood pressure, et cetera.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.680
 Caffeine increases this molecule

10:11.680 --> 10:14.240
 that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.160
 We discussed this in episode one,

10:16.160 --> 10:17.800
 which tends to make us feel good,

10:17.800 --> 10:20.200
 motivated, and give us energy

10:20.200 --> 10:23.360
 because as you may have learned in episode one,

10:23.360 --> 10:26.260
 dopamine is related to another neuromodulator

10:26.260 --> 10:28.380
 called epinephrine, which gives us energy.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.840
 In fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.120
 So let's just take a step back

10:32.120 --> 10:33.840
 and think about what we're talking about

10:33.840 --> 10:35.640
 when we're talking about sleepiness.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.880
 Sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine

10:38.880 --> 10:40.460
 that happen naturally.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.660
 Caffeine prevents the adenosine

10:44.660 --> 10:47.240
 from having its action of making us sleepy

10:47.240 --> 10:48.960
 by blocking that receptor.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.480
 So it gives us energy and it increases our dopamine levels,

10:52.480 --> 10:55.520
 but some people can't tolerate caffeine very well.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.640
 Other people can tolerate it just fine.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.280
 So you need to determine that experimentally.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.840
 All the data say there's tremendous variation.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.040
 And right now, the only way that I'm aware of

11:05.040 --> 11:06.660
 for you to decide whether or not caffeine

11:06.660 --> 11:08.800
 is a good or a bad thing for you

11:08.800 --> 11:10.560
 and whether or not you should ingest it

11:10.560 --> 11:13.000
 at a given time of day or at all

11:13.000 --> 11:14.700
 is really to figure that out on your own.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.800
 In fact, there's a small subset of people

11:16.800 --> 11:19.400
 that can drink caffeine until very late

11:19.400 --> 11:21.080
 and they have no trouble falling asleep

11:21.080 --> 11:23.380
 because they actually have a mutant form

11:23.380 --> 11:25.040
 of the adenosine receptor.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.920
 So in keeping with the theme of science

11:26.920 --> 11:28.520
 and science-related tools,

11:28.520 --> 11:30.680
 this is one of those cases where I can't give you

11:30.680 --> 11:32.920
 a one-size-fits-all prescription,

11:32.920 --> 11:35.660
 except to say you need to experiment with caffeine

11:35.660 --> 11:37.240
 in a way that's safe for you

11:37.240 --> 11:39.400
 and explore that and figure out what works for you

11:39.400 --> 11:41.160
 and then stick with that.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.520
 Okay, so adenosine is driving the sleep hunger.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.400
 When adenosine is low, it's like we're well-fed,

11:47.400 --> 11:48.560
 we're not very hungry.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.520
 And when adenosine is high,

11:50.520 --> 11:52.160
 it's like we're fasted for a long time

11:52.160 --> 11:53.840
 and we tend to be very hungry.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.520
 So when adenosine is high, we really wanna fall asleep.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.840
 If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment,

11:59.840 --> 12:00.800
 but you can do it,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.320
 you can stay up for four more hours

12:03.320 --> 12:04.560
 than you're used to staying up

12:04.560 --> 12:07.200
 and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.840
 That's because adenosine is building up

12:08.840 --> 12:10.580
 at levels higher and higher

12:10.580 --> 12:13.800
 because you've been awake for those extra four hours.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.280
 However, if you've ever pulled an all-nighter,

12:16.280 --> 12:18.160
 you'll notice something interesting.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.840
 As morning rolls around,

12:19.840 --> 12:22.160
 you'll suddenly feel an increase in your energy

12:22.160 --> 12:23.480
 and alertness again.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.260
 Even though adenosine has been building up

12:26.260 --> 12:28.560
 for the entire night.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.120
 Why is that?

12:30.120 --> 12:32.660
 The reason that is, is because there's a second force

12:32.660 --> 12:35.760
 which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.700
 And that force is a so-called circadian force.

12:39.700 --> 12:44.400
 Circadian means about a day or about 24 hours.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.140
 And inside all of us is a clock

12:47.140 --> 12:49.560
 that exists in your brain and my brain

12:49.560 --> 12:52.880
 and the brain of every animal that we're aware of,

12:52.880 --> 12:55.920
 that determines when we want to be sleepy

12:55.920 --> 12:57.960
 and when we want to be awake.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.800
 Just think about it.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.780
 We don't go through the day

12:59.780 --> 13:01.920
 wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes

13:01.920 --> 13:04.220
 and then feeling like we're wide awake.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.200
 Our sleep and our period of sleepiness

13:06.200 --> 13:09.660
 tends to be condensed into one block.

13:09.660 --> 13:12.140
 Typically one six to 10 hour block.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.800
 Although there's also variation

13:13.800 --> 13:15.840
 in terms of how much people want to sleep.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.020
 And we're going to discuss

13:17.020 --> 13:20.320
 how you can diagnose your absolute sleep need

13:20.320 --> 13:23.640
 as well as how to recover sleep that you've lost.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.520
 That block of sleep and when it falls

13:26.520 --> 13:28.640
 within each 24 hour cycle

13:28.640 --> 13:31.920
 is governed by a number of different things.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.680
 But the most powerful thing that's governing

13:33.680 --> 13:35.060
 when you want to be asleep

13:35.060 --> 13:38.800
 and when you want to be awake is light.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.400
 And in particular, it's governed by sunlight.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.840
 Now I can't emphasize enough how important

13:43.840 --> 13:46.720
 and how actionable this relationship is

13:46.720 --> 13:50.720
 between light and when you want to sleep.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.520
 It's quite simple on the face of it.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.040
 And it's quite simple to resolve

13:55.040 --> 13:56.900
 but people tend to make a big mess

13:56.900 --> 13:59.460
 of this whole circadian literature, frankly.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.240
 So let's just break it down from the standpoint

14:02.240 --> 14:05.160
 of what's going on in your brain and body

14:05.160 --> 14:08.360
 as you go through one 24 hour day.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.800
 Let's start with waking.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.920
 So regardless of how well you slept at night

14:11.920 --> 14:14.120
 or whether or not you were up all night,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.940
 most people tend to wake up sometime

14:16.940 --> 14:19.200
 around when the sun rises.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.580
 Maybe not right at sunrise,

14:20.580 --> 14:24.080
 but within an hour or two or maybe three of sunrise.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.900
 And I realized there are night shift workers

14:25.900 --> 14:28.740
 and there are people traveling and experiencing jet lag

14:28.740 --> 14:30.400
 where this is not gonna be the case.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.120
 We are gonna deal with jet lag and shift work

14:33.120 --> 14:35.040
 at the end of this podcast.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.840
 But for most people, we tend to wake up

14:36.840 --> 14:40.400
 about the time that the sun is rising or so.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.320
 And as we do that, adenosine levels tend to be low

14:44.320 --> 14:48.120
 if we've been asleep for reasons that you now understand.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.380
 And our system generates an internal signal

14:52.380 --> 14:54.400
 that is in the form of a hormone.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.520
 Now I've talked a lot about neuromodulators

14:56.520 --> 14:57.460
 and neurotransmitters.

14:57.460 --> 15:01.480
 I haven't talked a lot about hormones yet on this podcast.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.200
 The definition of a hormone is it's a substance,

15:04.200 --> 15:08.040
 a chemical that's released from one organ in your body

15:08.040 --> 15:11.760
 that goes and acts on other organs elsewhere in your body,

15:11.760 --> 15:13.980
 including your nervous system.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.700
 When you wake up in the morning,

15:15.700 --> 15:19.360
 you wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol

15:19.360 --> 15:21.640
 is released from your adrenal glands.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.780
 Your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys

15:23.780 --> 15:26.000
 and there's a little pulse of cortisol.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.120
 There's also a pulse of some, and when I say a pulse,

15:29.120 --> 15:31.400
 I just mean that the release of a little bit.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.360
 There's also a pulse of epinephrine,

15:34.360 --> 15:37.280
 which is adrenaline from your adrenals

15:37.280 --> 15:40.600
 and also in your brain, and you feel awake.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.320
 Now that pulse of cortisol and adrenaline

15:43.320 --> 15:45.520
 and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.160
 It might come from you naturally waking up,

15:48.160 --> 15:51.440
 but it tends to alert your whole system in your body

15:51.440 --> 15:53.040
 that it's time to increase your heart rate.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.560
 It's time to start tensing your muscles.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.960
 It's time to start moving about.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.040
 It's very important that that cortisol pulse

16:00.040 --> 16:02.120
 come early in the day,

16:02.120 --> 16:04.880
 or at least early in your period of wakefulness.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.720
 I say that because some people are waking up at 8 p.m.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.200
 and are sleeping all day,

16:09.200 --> 16:11.400
 but it's very important that that pulse of cortisol

16:11.400 --> 16:16.120
 occur early in the day and that it happens all at once.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.100
 It sort of sets a rising tide of cortisol in your system.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.460
 Now, many of you have probably heard about cortisol

16:22.460 --> 16:23.880
 in relation to stress,

16:23.880 --> 16:26.840
 and indeed, as we go through our day and our life,

16:26.840 --> 16:30.120
 different stressors, different events happen in our life

16:30.120 --> 16:32.160
 that make us feel more alert.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.440
 Some of the more stressful ones

16:33.440 --> 16:35.440
 might be looking at your credit card bill

16:35.440 --> 16:38.680
 and seeing what seems to be a fraudulent charge,

16:38.680 --> 16:41.380
 or looking at your phone and suddenly seeing a text

16:41.380 --> 16:42.760
 that something you thought was gonna happen

16:42.760 --> 16:44.320
 at a particular time is not gonna happen,

16:44.320 --> 16:45.580
 or you're running late.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.960
 Those will tend to increase norepinephrine and epinephrine,

16:48.960 --> 16:50.920
 an adrenaline in your system.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.500
 And if they're severe enough,

16:52.500 --> 16:55.000
 you'll start getting some pulses of cortisol

16:55.000 --> 16:57.400
 released from your adrenals throughout the day.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.240
 But there's this normal, healthy, rising tide of cortisol

17:01.240 --> 17:02.600
 that happens early in the day.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.880
 And I say healthy because it wakes you up.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.880
 It makes you feel alert.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.760
 It makes you feel able to move and wanting to move

17:08.760 --> 17:11.400
 and to go out about your day for work, for exercise,

17:11.400 --> 17:14.680
 for school, for social relations, et cetera.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.600
 So when you wake up in the morning

17:16.600 --> 17:19.720
 is when that cortisol pulse takes off

17:19.720 --> 17:21.980
 and something else important happens.

17:21.980 --> 17:25.840
 A timer is set in your body and in your nervous system

17:25.840 --> 17:29.840
 that dictates when a different hormone called melatonin,

17:29.840 --> 17:33.180
 which makes you sleepy, will be secreted

17:33.180 --> 17:34.700
 from a particular brain region.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.680
 So let's talk about that.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.800
 When you wake up in the morning

17:37.800 --> 17:40.980
 and you experience that rise in cortisol,

17:40.980 --> 17:43.560
 there's a timer that starts going,

17:43.560 --> 17:45.040
 and these are cellular timers,

17:45.040 --> 17:46.740
 and they're dictated by the relation

17:46.740 --> 17:48.620
 between different organs in your body

17:48.620 --> 17:51.200
 that says to your brain and body

17:51.200 --> 17:55.400
 that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone,

17:55.400 --> 17:57.320
 this hormone we're calling melatonin,

17:57.320 --> 18:00.280
 will be released from your pineal gland.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.680
 So there's two mechanisms here,

18:01.680 --> 18:04.400
 a wakefulness signal and a sleepiness signal.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.200
 And the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of the timer

18:08.200 --> 18:10.280
 for the sleepiness signal.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.560
 Now that sleepiness signal that we call melatonin

18:12.560 --> 18:16.920
 that's released from the pineal comes only from the pineal.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.120
 Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin,

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
 you're supplementing with melatonin,

18:21.120 --> 18:23.880
 the only source of melatonin in your body

18:23.880 --> 18:25.880
 is going to be this pineal gland.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.480
 So let's talk about the pineal gland for a second.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.920
 The pineal gland is a gland that sits

18:31.920 --> 18:34.280
 kind of in the little structure

18:34.280 --> 18:36.460
 near for the aficionados out there.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.560
 It's kind of near the fourth ventricle.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.400
 It's about the size of a pea.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.400
 Descartes, the philosopher,

18:42.400 --> 18:45.280
 said that the pineal was the seat of the soul.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.120
 He said that because it's one of the few structures

18:48.120 --> 18:51.680
 in the human brain that there's only one of them.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.120
 Most structures, there's one on either side of the brain,

18:54.120 --> 18:55.440
 so-called bihemispheric,

18:55.440 --> 18:57.400
 but the pineal, there's only one.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.080
 I don't know anything about souls, really.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.800
 Certainly not the science of souls,

19:01.800 --> 19:03.320
 but I think it's very unlikely

19:03.320 --> 19:05.840
 that the pineal is the seat of the soul,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.200
 but it is a very interesting organ

19:08.200 --> 19:10.520
 because it's the only organ in our body

19:10.520 --> 19:13.360
 that releases melatonin.

19:13.360 --> 19:18.160
 And that melatonin makes us sleepy and lets us fall asleep.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.360
 Now I'm guessing that many of you are probably asking,

19:21.360 --> 19:23.460
 should I take melatonin?

19:23.460 --> 19:28.460
 My personal bias on this is, except in rare cases, no,

19:28.520 --> 19:29.960
 for the following reason.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.200
 Melatonin has a second function,

19:32.200 --> 19:34.760
 which is that melatonin also suppresses

19:34.760 --> 19:36.900
 the onset of puberty.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.800
 In kids, and especially in babies,

19:38.800 --> 19:41.400
 melatonin isn't just released in the evening,

19:41.400 --> 19:44.200
 12 to 16 hours after we wake.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.840
 Melatonin is released chronically or tonically

19:47.840 --> 19:49.600
 throughout the day and night.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.340
 And that chronic or tonic release of melatonin

19:52.340 --> 19:54.680
 is known to suppress some of the other hormones

19:54.680 --> 19:56.120
 in other regions of the brain

19:56.120 --> 19:58.240
 that trigger the onset of puberty.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.520
 Now, if you or your child has been taking melatonin,

20:00.520 --> 20:01.880
 don't freak out.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.720
 As always, any kind of supplement

20:04.720 --> 20:07.900
 or anything that you're going to take or think about taking,

20:07.900 --> 20:09.920
 you really need to consult with your doctor.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.800
 I've said this many times on this podcast

20:11.800 --> 20:13.640
 and it's in the show notes, et cetera.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.560
 But before you remove anything or add anything

20:17.560 --> 20:18.960
 to what you're already doing,

20:18.960 --> 20:21.460
 please do consult with a healthcare professional.

20:21.460 --> 20:26.460
 However, melatonin is known to suppress the onset of puberty

20:26.760 --> 20:31.000
 so much so that regular cyclic cycled periods

20:31.000 --> 20:33.040
 of melatonin release from the pineal

20:33.040 --> 20:35.260
 really correlate with the onset of puberty

20:35.260 --> 20:37.000
 and early adulthood.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.760
 Meaning, as we start secreting melatonin only at night,

20:40.760 --> 20:43.760
 that's also when we tend to transition out of puberty.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.160
 Now, there are a lot of things that correlate

20:45.160 --> 20:46.040
 in our nervous system,

20:46.040 --> 20:48.120
 so it doesn't necessarily mean it controls it,

20:48.120 --> 20:51.340
 but in this case, we know based on lots of data

20:51.340 --> 20:53.040
 and endocrinology and so forth

20:53.040 --> 20:56.160
 that melatonin suppresses the onset of puberty.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.760
 So supplementing melatonin could be problematic

20:58.760 --> 21:00.360
 for that reason,

21:00.360 --> 21:03.080
 but if you've already gone through puberty,

21:03.080 --> 21:05.400
 it could also have some impact

21:05.400 --> 21:07.500
 on other hormone systems in your body.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.720
 So that's why I personally don't like to use melatonin

21:10.720 --> 21:12.040
 to fall asleep.

21:12.040 --> 21:12.860
 There's another reason,

21:12.860 --> 21:14.840
 which is that melatonin will help you fall asleep,

21:14.840 --> 21:16.680
 but it won't help you stay asleep.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.420
 And many people who take melatonin find that they wake up

21:19.420 --> 21:22.760
 three to five hours later, unable to fall back asleep.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.140
 Part of the reason for that might be

21:25.140 --> 21:27.760
 that melatonin purchased,

21:27.760 --> 21:30.440
 you can buy it over the counter in most areas of the world,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.260
 even though it's a hormone, which is a little unusual.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.560
 You can't just go into a pharmacy, at least in the US,

21:34.560 --> 21:37.380
 and buy testosterone or cortisol or estrogen.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.360
 You need a prescription,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.540
 but you can go buy melatonin for whatever reason.

21:40.540 --> 21:44.720
 I don't know the reasons for that legality,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.900
 but it's been shown many times,

21:46.900 --> 21:49.400
 and now I'm borrowing from some items

21:49.400 --> 21:52.080
 that were in Matt Walker's book, Why We Sleep,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.760
 where he stated there is evidence

21:54.760 --> 21:57.200
 that in commercially available melatonin,

21:57.200 --> 22:01.560
 the amount of melatonin has been tested for various brands,

22:01.560 --> 22:05.560
 and it can range anywhere from being 15%

22:05.560 --> 22:07.840
 of what's listed on the bottle, okay?

22:07.840 --> 22:09.880
 So if they list up, this is 100 milligrams,

22:09.880 --> 22:11.920
 would be a tremendously high dose.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.120
 It turns out it's only 15 milligrams

22:14.120 --> 22:16.440
 in that particular pill or capsule,

22:16.440 --> 22:21.000
 or up to 400 times more than what's listed on the bottle.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.840
 So it's completely unregulated.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.040
 And so for those of you taking melatonin,

22:25.040 --> 22:26.760
 I will discuss at the end of the podcast

22:26.760 --> 22:30.800
 some other potential alternatives that are probably safer

22:30.800 --> 22:32.620
 and don't have these issues.

22:32.620 --> 22:35.000
 So should you take melatonin?

22:35.000 --> 22:39.060
 My personal bias is no, but for many people,

22:39.060 --> 22:40.520
 they find that it does help them.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.040
 And so if you do find it helps you,

22:42.040 --> 22:43.800
 then just consider what I'm saying

22:43.800 --> 22:47.180
 in light of the other practices that you're doing

22:47.180 --> 22:49.120
 and talk to your healthcare professional.

22:49.120 --> 22:53.440
 Okay, so the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin

22:53.440 --> 22:55.080
 is what we call endogenous.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.140
 It's happening in us all the time

22:57.140 --> 22:59.040
 without any external input.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.400
 In fact, if we were in complete darkness,

23:01.400 --> 23:04.520
 living in a cave with no artificial lights whatsoever,

23:04.520 --> 23:07.220
 or we were in complete brightness,

23:07.220 --> 23:10.120
 where we never experienced any darkness,

23:10.120 --> 23:14.240
 these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.040
 You would have a bump in cortisol or a pulse in cortisol

23:17.040 --> 23:18.480
 that would drop off with time,

23:18.480 --> 23:23.240
 and then melatonin would come up about 12 to 14 hours later.

23:23.240 --> 23:27.360
 But these endogenous systems of our body,

23:27.360 --> 23:30.600
 which are both hormonal and neural,

23:30.600 --> 23:34.900
 were set so that external things

23:34.900 --> 23:36.880
 could govern when they happen.

23:36.880 --> 23:40.100
 Now, this takes us back to episode one of the podcast

23:40.100 --> 23:41.700
 that if you haven't listened to already,

23:41.700 --> 23:42.700
 you might wanna listen to,

23:42.700 --> 23:45.320
 where we talked about sensation and perception and all that.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.240
 I'm not gonna review it again here,

23:47.240 --> 23:51.060
 but there's one particular sensory event,

23:51.060 --> 23:53.960
 one particular influence on your nervous system

23:53.960 --> 23:58.320
 that determines when that cortisol is going to start to rise.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.520
 So if you were in complete darkness,

24:00.520 --> 24:03.600
 it would happen once per 24 hour cycle,

24:03.600 --> 24:08.280
 but it would be somewhat later and later each day.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.540
 Whereas under normal circumstances,

24:11.540 --> 24:13.840
 what happens is you wake up,

24:13.840 --> 24:15.640
 and what happens when you wake up?

24:15.640 --> 24:17.000
 You open your eyes.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.400
 When you open your eyes, light comes into your eyes.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.140
 Now, the way this system works

24:22.140 --> 24:24.820
 is that you have a particular set of neurons in your eye.

24:24.820 --> 24:26.440
 They're called retinal ganglion cells.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.760
 You don't have to remember that if you don't want to,

24:28.760 --> 24:32.380
 but these retinal ganglion cells are brain neurons.

24:32.380 --> 24:35.120
 Again, the retina is just the one piece of your brain,

24:35.120 --> 24:35.960
 actually two pieces,

24:35.960 --> 24:38.680
 because most of you have two retinas that resides

24:38.680 --> 24:41.880
 outside the skull per se.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.560
 When light comes into the eye,

24:43.560 --> 24:46.600
 there's a particular group of retinal ganglion cells

24:46.600 --> 24:48.920
 or type of retinal ganglion cells

24:48.920 --> 24:52.120
 that perceives a particular type of light

24:52.120 --> 24:54.180
 and communicates that to this clock

24:54.180 --> 24:56.000
 that resides right above the roof of your mouth

24:56.000 --> 24:59.360
 called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?

24:59.360 --> 25:00.960
 So I know this can get a little complicated,

25:00.960 --> 25:03.420
 but these retinal ganglion cells,

25:03.420 --> 25:05.740
 when you open your eyes, light comes in,

25:05.740 --> 25:08.800
 and an electrical signal is sent to this central clock

25:08.800 --> 25:11.080
 we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

25:11.080 --> 25:15.180
 And the suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections

25:15.180 --> 25:18.800
 with essentially every cell and organ of your body.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.680
 Now, it's vitally important that we get light

25:21.680 --> 25:23.880
 communicated to this central clock

25:23.880 --> 25:27.880
 in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.760
 When I say properly, I can say that with confidence,

25:30.760 --> 25:33.260
 because we know based on a lot of evidence

25:33.260 --> 25:35.680
 that if you don't get your cortisol

25:35.680 --> 25:38.000
 and melatonin rhythms right,

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
 there are tremendously broad and bad effects

25:43.060 --> 25:46.800
 on cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects,

25:46.800 --> 25:49.520
 learning, depression, dementia.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.200
 In fact, there are so many negative effects

25:51.200 --> 25:53.600
 associated with getting this wrong

25:53.600 --> 25:55.320
 that I don't want to go into it in too much detail.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.220
 In fact, I feel like we've been bombarded

25:58.220 --> 26:00.500
 with all this information about how we're not sleeping well,

26:00.500 --> 26:01.700
 we're not sleeping at the right times,

26:01.700 --> 26:02.880
 we're not sleeping enough

26:02.880 --> 26:05.720
 to the point where people now have sleep anxiety.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.660
 If they can't sleep well for a night,

26:07.660 --> 26:09.200
 they're feeling overwhelmed by that

26:09.200 --> 26:10.520
 and sort of now they're stressed

26:10.520 --> 26:11.700
 about not being able to sleep,

26:11.700 --> 26:14.120
 which is making it harder to sleep, et cetera.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.520
 I really want to focus on what we can do

26:16.520 --> 26:18.880
 to anchor these systems properly.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.160
 So let's think about what happens when we do this correctly

26:22.160 --> 26:23.580
 and how to do it correctly.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.840
 When we wake up, our eyes open.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.240
 Now, if we're in a dark room,

26:28.240 --> 26:32.320
 there isn't enough light to trigger the correct timing

26:32.320 --> 26:36.360
 of this cortisol-melatonin thing, these rhythms.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.400
 You might say, well, why won't any light do it?

26:39.400 --> 26:42.660
 Well, it turns out that these neurons in our eye

26:42.660 --> 26:44.320
 that set the circadian clock

26:44.320 --> 26:46.100
 and then allow our circadian clock

26:46.100 --> 26:48.380
 to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs

26:48.380 --> 26:52.040
 and tissues of our body responds best

26:52.040 --> 26:55.740
 to a particular quality of light and amount of light.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.320
 And those are the qualities of light

26:59.320 --> 27:02.400
 and amount of light that come from sunlight.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.080
 So these neurons, what they're really looking for,

27:07.080 --> 27:09.040
 although they don't have a mind of their own,

27:09.040 --> 27:12.460
 is the sun at what we call low solar angle.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.580
 The eye and the nervous system

27:13.580 --> 27:15.880
 don't know anything about sunrises or sunsets.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.320
 It only knows the quality of light

27:18.320 --> 27:20.960
 that comes in when the sun is low in the sky.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.880
 The system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky,

27:24.880 --> 27:28.960
 there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues

27:28.960 --> 27:31.460
 that triggers the activation of these cells.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.080
 So if you wake up and you look at your phone

27:33.080 --> 27:33.920
 or your computer,

27:33.920 --> 27:36.000
 or you flip on a bunch of artificial lights,

27:37.020 --> 27:38.960
 will these cells be activated?

27:38.960 --> 27:40.620
 And the answer is sort of.

27:40.620 --> 27:43.960
 They'll be activated, but not in the optimal way.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.560
 What you want to do is get sunlight in your eyes

27:46.560 --> 27:48.920
 as close to waking as possible.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.360
 Now, I want to be really clear about this

27:50.360 --> 27:52.880
 because I've talked about it on other podcasts

27:52.880 --> 27:53.720
 when I was a guest,

27:53.720 --> 27:55.900
 and I've talked about it on my Instagram feed,

27:55.900 --> 27:57.300
 and there seemed to be the same questions

27:57.300 --> 27:59.200
 coming up again and again.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.100
 These neurons don't know sunlight per se.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.400
 They don't know sunrise or sunset for that matter.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.540
 They don't know artificial light from sunlight.

28:08.540 --> 28:11.340
 What they respond best to, however,

28:11.340 --> 28:14.060
 is the quality and amount of light that comes in

28:14.060 --> 28:16.140
 when the sun is low in the sky.

28:16.140 --> 28:20.520
 That means that if you can watch the sunrise, great.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.980
 That's perfect for triggering activation of these cells.

28:23.980 --> 28:27.160
 However, if you wake up a few hours after the sunrise,

28:27.160 --> 28:30.100
 which I tend to most days, personally,

28:30.100 --> 28:33.820
 you still want to get outside and view sunlight.

28:33.820 --> 28:35.660
 You don't need the sunlight beaming you

28:35.660 --> 28:36.780
 directly in the eyes.

28:36.780 --> 28:39.140
 There's a lot of photons, light energy,

28:39.140 --> 28:41.740
 that's scattered from sunlight at this time.

28:41.740 --> 28:45.460
 But the key is to get that light energy

28:45.460 --> 28:48.060
 from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.060
 Now, I know many of you are already asking,

28:50.060 --> 28:52.980
 well, I live in Scandinavia or I can't get sunlight.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.640
 There's buildings around me, et cetera.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.700
 We will get to all of that.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.940
 But it's critically important that you get outside

28:58.940 --> 29:00.460
 to get this light.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.340
 I had a discussion with a colleague of mine,

29:02.340 --> 29:03.380
 Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,

29:03.380 --> 29:05.700
 who's in the Department of Psychiatry

29:05.700 --> 29:09.180
 and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,

29:09.180 --> 29:10.500
 a world expert in this.

29:10.500 --> 29:15.500
 And he tells me that it's 50 times less effective

29:15.980 --> 29:19.540
 to view the sunlight through a window,

29:19.540 --> 29:23.160
 through a car windshield or through a side window of a car,

29:23.160 --> 29:26.180
 than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses

29:26.180 --> 29:28.740
 and view light early in the day.

29:28.740 --> 29:31.140
 Now, if you can't see the sunrise, like I said,

29:31.140 --> 29:33.500
 you can see this within an hour or two of sunrise,

29:33.500 --> 29:35.120
 but it has to be low solar angle.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.540
 Once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts

29:38.540 --> 29:40.620
 so that you miss this opportunity

29:40.620 --> 29:42.500
 to time the cortisol pulse.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.960
 And that turns out to be a bad thing to do.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.140
 You really want to time that cortisol pulse properly

29:49.140 --> 29:52.320
 because we'll get into this a little bit more later,

29:52.320 --> 29:55.460
 but a late shifted cortisol pulse,

29:55.460 --> 29:59.520
 in particular in 9 p.m. or 8 p.m. increase in cortisol,

29:59.520 --> 30:04.520
 is one of the consequences and maybe one of the causes

30:04.540 --> 30:07.480
 of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.620
 So it's kind of a chicken egg thing.

30:08.620 --> 30:10.600
 We don't know whether or not it's the correlated with,

30:10.600 --> 30:12.580
 it's the cause or the effect,

30:12.580 --> 30:15.840
 but it's a signature of depression and anxiety disorder.

30:15.840 --> 30:19.660
 Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in your wakeful period,

30:19.660 --> 30:22.980
 earlier in your day, has positive benefits

30:22.980 --> 30:26.500
 ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.520
 I'm not going to list them all off

30:27.520 --> 30:29.200
 because there's just so many of them,

30:29.200 --> 30:31.400
 but many, many positive things happen

30:31.400 --> 30:34.580
 when you are getting the cortisol early in the day,

30:34.580 --> 30:37.360
 far away from your melatonin pulse.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.060
 Okay, so how long should you be outside?

30:40.060 --> 30:42.260
 Well, this is going to vary tremendously

30:42.260 --> 30:43.820
 because some people live in environments

30:43.820 --> 30:44.660
 where it's very bright.

30:44.660 --> 30:48.500
 So let's say it's Colorado in the middle of winter,

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
 there's a snow field, there's no cloud cover,

30:50.500 --> 30:52.000
 and you walk outside.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.180
 There's going to be so much photon light energy

30:55.180 --> 30:56.660
 arriving on your retina

30:56.660 --> 30:58.820
 that probably only takes 30 to 60 seconds

30:58.820 --> 31:00.260
 to trigger the central clock

31:00.260 --> 31:03.080
 and set your cortisol and melatonin rhythms properly

31:03.080 --> 31:06.120
 and get everything lined up nicely.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.940
 Whereas if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter

31:09.940 --> 31:11.140
 and you wake up at 5 a.m.

31:11.140 --> 31:13.720
 and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon

31:13.720 --> 31:16.160
 then goes back down again a few hours later,

31:16.160 --> 31:19.900
 you probably are not getting enough sunlight

31:19.900 --> 31:22.220
 in order to set these rhythms.

31:22.220 --> 31:24.300
 So many people find

31:24.300 --> 31:27.180
 that they need to use sunlight simulators

31:27.180 --> 31:29.040
 in the form of particular lights

31:29.040 --> 31:30.780
 that were designed to simulate sunlight.

31:30.780 --> 31:33.580
 However, I'm not out to attack the companies

31:33.580 --> 31:34.860
 that produce those.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.740
 There's another solution to that.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.060
 You can simply go outside for longer.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.240
 Even if there's a lot of dense cloud cover,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.180
 you're probably getting

31:44.180 --> 31:48.340
 anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 lux, L-U-X,

31:48.340 --> 31:50.500
 which is just a measure of light energy.

31:50.500 --> 31:54.140
 And that should be sufficient to set the circadian clock.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.820
 You could say, well, the lights in my house

31:57.820 --> 31:59.940
 or my phone are really, really bright, right?

31:59.940 --> 32:01.700
 Everyone's telling us to stay off our phones at night

32:01.700 --> 32:03.260
 because they're really bright.

32:03.260 --> 32:04.100
 But guess what?

32:04.100 --> 32:06.320
 It turns out that early in the day,

32:06.320 --> 32:09.240
 your retina is not very sensitive,

32:09.240 --> 32:12.140
 which means you need a lot of photons,

32:12.140 --> 32:13.520
 ideally coming from sunlight,

32:13.520 --> 32:15.280
 to set these clock mechanisms.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.560
 So looking at your phone or artificial lights is fine

32:17.560 --> 32:19.860
 if you wake up before sunrise,

32:19.860 --> 32:24.160
 but it's not going to work to set these clock mechanisms.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.660
 And this is supported by dozens, if not hundreds,

32:26.660 --> 32:29.100
 of quality peer-reviewed studies.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.660
 So you want to use sunlight.

32:30.660 --> 32:33.800
 If you can't see sunlight because of your environment,

32:33.800 --> 32:37.100
 then you are going to have to opt for artificial light.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.640
 And in that case, you're going to want an artificial light

32:39.640 --> 32:44.060
 that either simulates sunlight or has a lot of blue light.

32:44.060 --> 32:45.780
 Now, without going off course here,

32:45.780 --> 32:47.920
 you might be saying, wait, I've heard blue light

32:47.920 --> 32:48.880
 is bad for me.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.820
 Actually, blue light is great for this mechanism

32:51.820 --> 32:52.720
 during the day.

32:53.660 --> 32:57.060
 We can talk about blue light and blue blockers,

32:57.060 --> 33:00.120
 but you really want a lot of blue and yellow light

33:00.120 --> 33:02.020
 arriving on the retina early in the day.

33:02.020 --> 33:03.820
 Let me be clear about something.

33:03.820 --> 33:06.280
 You never ever want to look at any light,

33:06.280 --> 33:09.980
 sunlight or artificial light, that is painful to look at.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.740
 If you find that your eyes are watering

33:11.740 --> 33:14.660
 or you're having challenges maintaining,

33:14.660 --> 33:17.140
 looking at this thing for a while because it's painful,

33:17.140 --> 33:18.140
 that light is too bright

33:18.140 --> 33:20.020
 and you do not want to damage your retina.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.180
 So you don't want to gaze at the sun,

33:22.180 --> 33:25.840
 refusing to blink and burn your retina.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.080
 That's actually possible to do.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.380
 You don't want to do that.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.060
 You have a proper blink reflex installed in you since birth.

33:33.060 --> 33:34.980
 And if you feel like something's too bright

33:34.980 --> 33:36.660
 and you need to blink, it means you need to blink,

33:36.660 --> 33:38.780
 that it's too much light.

33:38.780 --> 33:41.820
 So please don't beam your eyes with really bright light.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.860
 But blue light, in particular blue light

33:43.860 --> 33:45.980
 and yellow light coming from sunlight is ideal.

33:45.980 --> 33:48.040
 If you're going to get it from artificial light,

33:48.040 --> 33:49.620
 because you can't get enough sunlight,

33:49.620 --> 33:54.380
 well then artificial lights that are rich in blue,

33:54.380 --> 33:56.580
 blue wavelengths are going to be ideal

33:56.580 --> 33:58.340
 for setting this mechanism.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.160
 A lot of people will say,

33:59.160 --> 34:01.240
 oh, I should be wearing blue blockers throughout the day.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.980
 No, that's the exact wrong thing.

34:03.980 --> 34:05.660
 If you're going to use blue blockers,

34:05.660 --> 34:06.540
 we can talk about that.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.380
 That should be reserved for late in the evening

34:09.380 --> 34:12.660
 because light suppresses melatonin.

34:12.660 --> 34:16.860
 I've been asked many times before about this pineal gland.

34:16.860 --> 34:19.400
 And there are a lot of ancient practices

34:19.400 --> 34:21.060
 that map to some of the things that I'm saying.

34:21.060 --> 34:21.880
 And people always say,

34:21.880 --> 34:24.660
 oh, I heard that sunlight is great for the pineal.

34:24.660 --> 34:28.360
 Well, perhaps, but we have to be careful about that phrase.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.140
 Sunlight inhibits the pineal.

34:31.140 --> 34:34.260
 It prevents it from releasing melatonin.

34:34.260 --> 34:38.180
 Darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin.

34:38.180 --> 34:41.940
 So the pineal is not the gland or the organ of sunlight.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.860
 It is the gland of darkness.

34:43.860 --> 34:47.180
 In fact, melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal

34:47.180 --> 34:48.940
 that's correlated with darkness.

34:48.940 --> 34:52.040
 So get up each morning, try and get outside.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.680
 I know that can be challenging for people,

34:53.680 --> 34:58.080
 but anywhere from two to 10 minutes of sunlight exposure

34:58.080 --> 34:59.840
 is going to work well for most people.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.700
 And you want to do this on a regular basis

35:01.700 --> 35:03.580
 and you don't have to do it exactly at sunrise.

35:03.580 --> 35:05.180
 I realize I'm repeating myself,

35:05.180 --> 35:08.340
 but somehow despite barking at people about this

35:08.340 --> 35:09.960
 for a couple of years now,

35:09.960 --> 35:11.380
 I keep getting the same questions.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.660
 And somehow it hasn't been sinking in,

35:14.700 --> 35:16.820
 which could be related to some circadian disorder.

35:16.820 --> 35:17.640
 I'm just kidding.

35:17.640 --> 35:18.600
 If it's not sinking in,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.180
 it's probably that I'm not being effective

35:20.180 --> 35:22.640
 in communicating the information.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.620
 But get that bright light early in the day from sunlight.

35:25.620 --> 35:26.820
 And if you can't get it from sunlight,

35:26.820 --> 35:28.180
 get it from artificial light.

35:28.180 --> 35:29.960
 What kinds of artificial lights will work?

35:29.960 --> 35:33.100
 Well, there are these sunrise simulators,

35:33.100 --> 35:37.220
 but the ring lights that people use for selfies

35:37.220 --> 35:39.760
 and this sort of thing for posting on Instagram,

35:39.760 --> 35:42.060
 those generate a lot of blue light.

35:42.060 --> 35:44.040
 If you want to get experimental about this,

35:44.040 --> 35:45.060
 there's a free app.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.640
 I have no relationship to the app,

35:46.640 --> 35:48.800
 but it's a great app called Light Meter

35:48.800 --> 35:50.580
 that you can use your phone

35:50.580 --> 35:53.020
 and you can measure the amount of photon energy

35:53.020 --> 35:54.060
 in your environment.

35:54.060 --> 35:55.340
 And it's kind of a fun experiment to do.

35:55.340 --> 35:56.600
 You can go outside in the morning

35:56.600 --> 35:59.140
 and you'll see that there's 10,000, 20,000 lux,

35:59.140 --> 36:01.060
 even though it might seem like it's kind of dim

36:01.060 --> 36:02.700
 or there's tree cover or cloud cover,

36:02.700 --> 36:06.900
 you go inside and you shine that artificial light

36:06.900 --> 36:09.100
 at your phone, press the button on Light Meter

36:09.100 --> 36:12.020
 and you'll find that it's only 500 or 1,000 lux.

36:12.020 --> 36:15.320
 And you realize that even though it seems really bright,

36:15.320 --> 36:17.860
 the artificial light is very condensed,

36:17.860 --> 36:22.380
 whereas the outside light is scattered in the atmosphere.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.420
 And so you can think that you're not getting much sunlight,

36:24.420 --> 36:26.040
 but you're actually getting much more outside.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.260
 So get outside, get that sunlight early in the day

36:28.260 --> 36:30.200
 and try and do it on a consistent basis.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.380
 If you can't do it every day

36:31.380 --> 36:33.740
 or you sleep through this period of the early day,

36:33.740 --> 36:36.180
 low solar angle, don't worry about it.

36:36.180 --> 36:37.560
 The systems in the body,

36:37.560 --> 36:40.100
 these hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems

36:40.100 --> 36:42.620
 that make you awake at certain periods of the day

36:42.620 --> 36:46.220
 and sleepy at other times are operating

36:46.220 --> 36:50.080
 by averaging when you view the brightest light.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.860
 Now, that can immediately tell us

36:52.860 --> 36:54.660
 that what most people are doing is terrible.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.500
 They're waking up and they're looking at their phone,

36:56.500 --> 36:59.300
 which isn't triggering activation of these cells in the eye

36:59.300 --> 37:00.980
 and the central circadian clock.

37:00.980 --> 37:02.060
 Then a few hours later,

37:02.060 --> 37:04.460
 they might get in their car with sunglasses and drive.

37:04.460 --> 37:08.300
 Now, a note about sunglasses and prescription lenses.

37:08.300 --> 37:12.300
 Absolutely never, ever, ever compromise safety

37:12.300 --> 37:13.960
 for the sorts of things I'm talking about.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.260
 So if you need to wear sunglasses for safety reasons,

37:16.260 --> 37:17.300
 wear them.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.140
 Absolutely, if you wear prescription lenses or contacts,

37:20.140 --> 37:20.980
 wear them.

37:20.980 --> 37:23.700
 They won't filter out the wavelengths of light

37:23.700 --> 37:26.100
 that are necessary for setting these central clocks.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.160
 So safety first, of course.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.440
 If you have a retinal degenerative disorder,

37:30.440 --> 37:33.320
 retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, or glaucoma,

37:33.320 --> 37:35.380
 or those run in your family,

37:35.380 --> 37:38.660
 you want to avoid excessively bright light all the time.

37:38.660 --> 37:40.300
 You want to be very cautious about that.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.380
 You're going to want to get your light exposure

37:42.380 --> 37:46.780
 by through seeing dimmer light, including sunlight,

37:46.780 --> 37:48.780
 but for longer periods of time, perhaps.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.260
 You might immediately ask,

37:51.260 --> 37:53.820
 what about low vision or blind people?

37:53.820 --> 37:55.340
 How do they set these central clocks?

37:55.340 --> 37:57.980
 Well, it turns out that low vision and blind people,

37:57.980 --> 38:00.260
 most of them, provided they still have eyes,

38:00.260 --> 38:01.260
 that the eyes weren't removed

38:01.260 --> 38:03.660
 because of a burn or tumor or something like that,

38:03.660 --> 38:07.780
 still maintain these neurons that set the circadian clock,

38:07.780 --> 38:10.260
 which brings me to a really important point.

38:10.260 --> 38:13.720
 It's not about seeing and perceiving the sun.

38:13.720 --> 38:17.580
 This is a subconscious mechanism by which these neurons,

38:17.580 --> 38:20.860
 which are called melanopsin ganglion cells,

38:20.860 --> 38:24.580
 these neurons set your central clocks

38:24.580 --> 38:28.060
 by getting activated by the particular wavelengths of light

38:28.060 --> 38:29.540
 that are present in the atmosphere,

38:29.540 --> 38:32.020
 even coming through cloud cover.

38:32.020 --> 38:35.180
 And you don't need to see or perceive the sun

38:35.180 --> 38:37.580
 in order to get this mechanism to start.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.540
 Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism

38:39.540 --> 38:44.100
 because it dictates how well and what time

38:44.100 --> 38:46.260
 you will want to fall asleep later in the day.

38:46.260 --> 38:47.860
 So for those of you that are night owls

38:47.860 --> 38:49.380
 and you insist that you're a night owl

38:49.380 --> 38:51.100
 and you have the genetic polymorphism

38:51.100 --> 38:52.060
 that makes you a night owl,

38:52.060 --> 38:54.820
 you may very well have that genetic polymorphism,

38:54.820 --> 38:56.900
 those genes that make you want to stay up late

38:56.900 --> 38:58.660
 and wake up late.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.360
 But chances are about half of you

39:00.360 --> 39:01.920
 that think that you're night owls

39:01.920 --> 39:04.840
 are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day.

39:04.840 --> 39:08.380
 So viewing light early in the day, ideally sunlight,

39:08.380 --> 39:12.480
 is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake rhythms

39:12.480 --> 39:16.420
 and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.740
 Now, it's not gonna make sure

39:17.740 --> 39:19.660
 that all that happens every single time,

39:19.660 --> 39:23.220
 but it is the foundation of proper sleep

39:23.220 --> 39:25.420
 and what we call circadian health.

39:25.420 --> 39:28.600
 It governs metabolism and so many other things

39:28.600 --> 39:32.160
 that are supposed to exist on a regular 24-hour cycle.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.140
 Some of you, many of you might be asking,

39:36.140 --> 39:37.940
 what else can help set this rhythm?

39:37.940 --> 39:39.480
 Well, it turns out that light

39:39.480 --> 39:43.940
 is what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver.

39:43.940 --> 39:48.140
 But other things can help establish this rhythm

39:48.140 --> 39:49.940
 of cortisol followed by melatonin

39:49.940 --> 39:52.480
 12 to 16 hours later as well.

39:52.480 --> 39:57.020
 The other things besides light are timing of food intake,

39:57.020 --> 40:01.380
 timing of exercise, as well as various drugs

40:01.380 --> 40:04.460
 or chemicals that one might ingest, not illegal drugs,

40:04.460 --> 40:07.320
 although those will impact circadian mechanisms as well.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.520
 But the reason we focus so heavily on light

40:10.520 --> 40:15.520
 is that light is the main way that the central clock,

40:15.700 --> 40:18.960
 the suprachiasmatic nucleus was supposed to be set.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.340
 We know that because it's the only direct input

40:22.340 --> 40:23.440
 to the clock.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.540
 These neurons in the eye that are also part of the brain

40:25.540 --> 40:27.720
 that we call melanopsin ganglion cells

40:27.720 --> 40:30.260
 that not so incidentally were discovered

40:30.260 --> 40:32.100
 by my friend and colleague David Berson

40:32.100 --> 40:34.700
 at Brown University and others,

40:34.700 --> 40:37.340
 Samir Hatar, King Wayao, et cetera,

40:37.340 --> 40:39.500
 worked out the mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms,

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
 but it was really David Berson

40:41.500 --> 40:46.420
 that discovered these incredibly fascinating non,

40:46.420 --> 40:48.520
 these are cells that aren't important for sight

40:48.520 --> 40:51.940
 like pattern vision, but are for setting our clocks.

40:51.940 --> 40:55.060
 David's really credited with making that discovery.

40:55.060 --> 40:58.580
 Those cells are the main way

40:58.580 --> 41:01.460
 and the only direct way to set the clock.

41:01.460 --> 41:04.620
 In fact, it's fair to say that light

41:04.620 --> 41:08.580
 viewed by these melanopsin cells, particular sunlight,

41:08.580 --> 41:12.460
 is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective

41:12.460 --> 41:16.040
 than say getting up in darkness and just exercising.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.580
 That doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise

41:17.580 --> 41:20.020
 early in the day in darkness if that's what you like to do.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.340
 It will have somewhat an effect

41:22.340 --> 41:25.080
 on raising your wakefulness early in the day

41:25.080 --> 41:27.620
 and setting these rhythms.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.460
 And this is because of some other pathways.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.060
 For the aficionados out there

41:31.060 --> 41:33.860
 who want to know more neuroscience, here's how it goes.

41:33.860 --> 41:35.900
 You've got this clock above the roof of your mouth

41:35.900 --> 41:37.680
 that churns out this 24-hour rhythm

41:37.680 --> 41:39.580
 and is communicated to all the other organs

41:39.580 --> 41:41.140
 and tissues of your body.

41:41.140 --> 41:43.540
 But there's another structure, has a cool name.

41:43.540 --> 41:45.840
 It's called the intergeniculate leaflet,

41:45.840 --> 41:48.300
 which sits a few millimeters away in the brain,

41:48.300 --> 41:51.540
 and it's involved in regulating the clock output

41:51.540 --> 41:55.640
 through what's called non-photic, non-light type influences

41:55.640 --> 41:58.420
 like exercise and feeding, et cetera.

41:58.420 --> 42:02.380
 So if you are not feeling awake during the day

42:02.380 --> 42:04.160
 and you're having trouble sleeping,

42:04.160 --> 42:07.140
 get the sunlight exposure that we just talked about.

42:07.140 --> 42:09.140
 But in addition to that,

42:09.140 --> 42:11.500
 if you want to become an early riser, for instance,

42:11.500 --> 42:12.540
 and you want to feel more awake

42:12.540 --> 42:15.140
 during the early part of the day,

42:15.140 --> 42:16.460
 by getting that light exposure

42:16.460 --> 42:18.940
 and exercising early in the day,

42:18.940 --> 42:21.220
 you will, after two or three days,

42:21.220 --> 42:23.660
 you will naturally start to wake up earlier in the day.

42:23.660 --> 42:26.100
 And that's because these clock mechanisms have shifted.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.820
 It's like setting the clock earlier

42:27.820 --> 42:30.220
 as opposed to delaying the clock.

42:30.220 --> 42:33.480
 And that takes us to a somewhat complicated

42:33.480 --> 42:35.780
 but very important aspect to all this,

42:35.780 --> 42:39.360
 which is what sets the clock and keeps it anchored.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.520
 The main thing is that bright light early in the day.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.460
 The other thing is sunset.

42:44.460 --> 42:47.640
 When the sun is also at low solar angle,

42:47.640 --> 42:49.300
 low, close to the horizon,

42:49.300 --> 42:53.500
 by viewing sunlight at that time of day in the evening

42:53.500 --> 42:55.380
 or afternoon, depending on what time of year it is

42:55.380 --> 42:57.300
 and where you are in the world,

42:57.300 --> 42:59.780
 these melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eye,

42:59.780 --> 43:01.940
 signal the central circadian clock

43:01.940 --> 43:04.060
 that it's the end of the day.

43:04.060 --> 43:06.900
 And there's a really nice study that was published last year

43:06.900 --> 43:09.740
 and I will put links to these references on a website

43:09.740 --> 43:11.820
 not too long from now.

43:11.820 --> 43:14.740
 There was a really nice study that showed

43:14.740 --> 43:18.860
 that viewing sunlight around the time of sunset

43:18.860 --> 43:21.280
 doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon,

43:21.280 --> 43:25.140
 but circa sunset within an hour or so of sunset

43:26.420 --> 43:29.900
 prevents some of the bad effects of light

43:29.900 --> 43:33.820
 in preventing melatonin release later that same night.

43:33.820 --> 43:34.740
 So let me repeat this.

43:34.740 --> 43:36.300
 Viewing light early in the day is key.

43:36.300 --> 43:39.460
 Viewing light later in the day when the sun is setting

43:39.460 --> 43:43.900
 or around that time can help protect these mechanisms,

43:43.900 --> 43:46.780
 your brain and body against the negative effects

43:46.780 --> 43:48.780
 of light later in the day.

43:48.780 --> 43:51.260
 So let me talk about how you would do that.

43:51.260 --> 43:52.620
 You'd go view the sunset,

43:52.620 --> 43:55.900
 or you would go outside in the late afternoon or evening.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.320
 Again, if you safely can do that with sunglasses off,

43:58.320 --> 43:59.380
 you will.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.620
 If you need to wear sunglasses, fine,

44:00.620 --> 44:03.220
 but it will take probably a hundred to a thousand times

44:03.220 --> 44:06.100
 longer with dark sunglasses than if you take them off.

44:07.740 --> 44:09.640
 Again, if you want to do this through a window at work,

44:09.640 --> 44:12.060
 that's fine, but it'll take 50 times longer.

44:12.060 --> 44:14.220
 So the best thing to do is just to get outside

44:14.220 --> 44:16.300
 for a few minutes, anywhere from two to 10 minutes

44:16.300 --> 44:17.740
 also in the afternoon.

44:17.740 --> 44:21.100
 Having those two signals arriving to your central clock

44:21.100 --> 44:23.540
 that your body, your internal world,

44:23.540 --> 44:25.740
 knows when it's morning and knows when it's evening

44:25.740 --> 44:27.980
 is tremendously powerful.

44:27.980 --> 44:29.980
 Maybe think about it this way.

44:29.980 --> 44:33.060
 Every cell in your body needs glucose and energy.

44:33.060 --> 44:35.200
 It needs, whether or not it gets that from meat

44:35.200 --> 44:37.740
 or it gets it from ketones or it gets it from carbohydrates

44:37.740 --> 44:39.460
 or fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter.

44:39.460 --> 44:42.300
 It is eventually converted into a certain form of energy

44:42.300 --> 44:43.940
 that all your cells use.

44:43.940 --> 44:45.720
 But you don't take glucose,

44:45.720 --> 44:49.020
 you don't take a bread or a steak or a nice orange

44:49.020 --> 44:50.320
 and shove it in your ear.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.340
 You put it in your mouth, it goes into your stomach,

44:52.340 --> 44:55.640
 it's digested, and then that resource is distributed

44:55.640 --> 44:57.500
 to all the cells of your body.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.860
 Every cell in your body needs oxygen

44:59.860 --> 45:03.300
 and you don't put a hose through your nostril

45:03.300 --> 45:05.180
 or through your ear or through some other orifice

45:05.180 --> 45:06.160
 in your body.

45:06.160 --> 45:10.220
 You inhale air and it's then distributed via the lungs

45:10.220 --> 45:12.320
 to the cells in your bloodstream

45:12.320 --> 45:15.360
 and that's distributed to all the organs of your body.

45:15.360 --> 45:19.420
 Every cell and organ in your body needs light information.

45:19.420 --> 45:21.260
 And the way to get that light information

45:21.260 --> 45:24.460
 to all those cells, because you have a thick skull

45:24.460 --> 45:29.180
 and inside of you is dark inside your skin,

45:29.180 --> 45:30.780
 there's no sunlight getting in there,

45:30.780 --> 45:32.720
 is by viewing sunlight with your eyes

45:32.720 --> 45:35.500
 at the two times a day that I'm referring to, okay?

45:35.500 --> 45:37.380
 That's the only route.

45:37.380 --> 45:39.000
 There was a study published in Science,

45:39.000 --> 45:43.180
 an excellent journal well over 10 years ago

45:43.180 --> 45:46.200
 that showed that light shown on the back of the knee

45:46.200 --> 45:49.140
 could set these circadian rhythms.

45:49.140 --> 45:50.620
 That study was retracted

45:50.620 --> 45:52.100
 and unfortunately most people don't know

45:52.100 --> 45:53.360
 that it was retracted.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.940
 There were some experimental flaws

45:54.940 --> 45:57.460
 that people were actually viewing light through their eyes.

45:57.460 --> 45:58.700
 That study was repeated.

45:58.700 --> 46:03.420
 Turns out there is no extra ocular photoreception in humans.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.820
 Whatever somebody tells you that light to the skin

46:05.820 --> 46:09.460
 or light to the wherever is beneficial for your health,

46:09.460 --> 46:10.660
 we can talk about that,

46:10.660 --> 46:12.700
 but there's no way that light information

46:12.700 --> 46:14.700
 is setting your clocks.

46:14.700 --> 46:17.940
 You need these cells in your eyes to perceive

46:17.940 --> 46:20.660
 or to see light at the particular times of day

46:20.660 --> 46:22.020
 that I'm referring to.

46:22.020 --> 46:25.060
 Some animals like snakes and other reptiles

46:25.060 --> 46:27.740
 actually have a hole in the top of their skull

46:27.740 --> 46:30.900
 to get light information directly to their pineal

46:30.900 --> 46:32.900
 where to suppress melatonin.

46:32.900 --> 46:33.960
 We don't have that hole.

46:33.960 --> 46:37.100
 I mean, most of you don't have holes in your skull.

46:37.100 --> 46:39.600
 These holes in your skull that we call

46:39.600 --> 46:43.160
 the sockets for the eyes are actually there

46:43.160 --> 46:46.600
 primarily to allow light information to the central clock.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.660
 And then vision and pattern vision and color vision

46:48.660 --> 46:50.540
 came much later in evolution.

46:50.540 --> 46:52.320
 We know this on the basis of genetic studies

46:52.320 --> 46:55.100
 we get to discuss in a future podcast.

46:55.100 --> 46:56.880
 So get that light information

46:56.880 --> 46:59.020
 to the cells of your brain and body

46:59.860 --> 47:01.420
 by viewing sunlight at the two times a day

47:01.420 --> 47:02.380
 that I referred to.

47:03.980 --> 47:06.260
 There's always a lot of questions about how long,

47:06.260 --> 47:07.840
 how much, how do I know if I've had enough?

47:07.840 --> 47:11.020
 You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall

47:11.020 --> 47:13.160
 into some degree of normalcy.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.580
 You'll start to wake up at more or less

47:14.580 --> 47:15.660
 the same time each day.

47:15.660 --> 47:17.340
 You'll fall asleep more easily at night.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.040
 Generally it takes about two or three days

47:19.040 --> 47:20.720
 for these systems to align.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.960
 So if you've not been doing these behaviors,

47:22.960 --> 47:24.180
 it's gonna take a few days

47:24.180 --> 47:26.300
 but they can have tremendous benefits

47:26.300 --> 47:28.920
 and sometimes rather quickly on a number of different

47:28.920 --> 47:31.060
 mental and physical aspects of your health.

47:32.940 --> 47:35.780
 Now let's talk about the bad effects of light

47:35.780 --> 47:40.300
 because light is not supposed to arrive in our system

47:40.300 --> 47:41.500
 at any time.

47:41.500 --> 47:44.460
 And nowadays, because of screens and artificial light,

47:44.460 --> 47:48.540
 we have access to light at times of day and night

47:48.540 --> 47:50.560
 that normally we wouldn't.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.260
 Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light

47:53.260 --> 47:56.260
 in particular sunlight to set these clock mechanisms.

47:56.260 --> 47:59.060
 That's true but there's a kind of diabolical feature

47:59.060 --> 48:00.180
 to the way all this works

48:00.180 --> 48:02.920
 which is the longer you've been awake,

48:02.920 --> 48:07.920
 the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light.

48:08.020 --> 48:11.780
 So that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours,

48:11.780 --> 48:14.720
 it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light

48:14.720 --> 48:19.440
 coming from a screen or from an overhead light

48:19.440 --> 48:21.760
 to trigger the activation of the clock

48:21.760 --> 48:23.620
 and make you feel like you wanna stay up later,

48:23.620 --> 48:24.880
 make it harder to fall asleep

48:24.880 --> 48:27.040
 and disrupt your sleep pattern.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.440
 Okay, so the simple way to think about this

48:29.440 --> 48:32.240
 is you want as much light as is safely possible

48:32.240 --> 48:34.600
 early in the day, morning and throughout the day,

48:34.600 --> 48:35.820
 including blue light.

48:35.820 --> 48:37.820
 So take those blue blockers off during the day

48:37.820 --> 48:40.820
 unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity.

48:40.820 --> 48:43.820
 And you want as little light coming into your eyes,

48:43.820 --> 48:47.560
 artificial or sunlight after say 8 p.m.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.500
 And certainly you do not want to get bright light exposure

48:50.500 --> 48:52.600
 to your eyes between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.040
 And here's why.

48:54.040 --> 48:56.140
 David Berson, who I mentioned before

48:56.140 --> 48:58.260
 and another friend and colleague, Samir Hattar,

48:58.260 --> 49:00.020
 who's director of the Chronobiology Unit

49:00.020 --> 49:02.180
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

49:02.180 --> 49:05.740
 published a paper in Cell, which is a journal,

49:05.740 --> 49:07.900
 another excellent journal, very high stringency,

49:07.900 --> 49:12.900
 showing that light that arrives to the eyes

49:13.020 --> 49:16.840
 between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. approximately

49:16.840 --> 49:20.300
 suppresses the release of dopamine,

49:20.300 --> 49:22.220
 this neuromodulator that makes us feel good

49:22.220 --> 49:25.780
 as sort of an endogenous antidepressant

49:25.780 --> 49:27.000
 and can inhibit learning

49:27.000 --> 49:30.580
 and create all sorts of other detrimental effects.

49:30.580 --> 49:32.280
 It does this through a mechanism,

49:32.280 --> 49:34.440
 for those of you who want to know the neural pathways,

49:34.440 --> 49:35.860
 that involves light to the eyes

49:35.860 --> 49:38.800
 that then signal to a structure called the habenula.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.620
 The habenula looks like two little bat ears

49:40.620 --> 49:41.860
 sitting right in the middle of you,

49:41.860 --> 49:43.500
 structuring your brain called the thalamus.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.620
 Don't worry about these names

49:44.620 --> 49:45.680
 if you're not interested in this stuff.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.380
 If you are, these are just avenues to explore.

49:48.380 --> 49:50.320
 When that habenula gets activated,

49:50.320 --> 49:53.100
 it's actually called the disappointment nucleus

49:53.100 --> 49:57.040
 because it actually makes us feel less happy

49:57.040 --> 49:58.140
 and more disappointed

49:58.140 --> 50:00.660
 and can lead to certain forms of depression

50:00.660 --> 50:02.140
 in the wakeful state.

50:02.140 --> 50:03.420
 Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night

50:03.420 --> 50:04.420
 and you need to use the bathroom

50:04.420 --> 50:05.740
 or you're on an all night flight

50:05.740 --> 50:10.280
 and you need to read or whatever it is, fine.

50:11.340 --> 50:13.300
 Every once in a while, it's not going to be a problem

50:13.300 --> 50:15.380
 to get bright light exposure to your eyes

50:15.380 --> 50:16.820
 in the middle of the night.

50:16.820 --> 50:19.500
 But if you think about our lifestyle nowadays

50:19.500 --> 50:21.100
 and being up late looking at phones,

50:21.100 --> 50:22.780
 even if you dim that screen,

50:22.780 --> 50:24.660
 you're triggering this activation

50:24.660 --> 50:26.140
 because your retinal sensitivity

50:26.140 --> 50:28.260
 and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up

50:28.260 --> 50:29.700
 late in the day.

50:29.700 --> 50:32.040
 Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do

50:32.040 --> 50:34.580
 but for those of you that are experiencing challenges

50:34.580 --> 50:36.540
 with mood, those of you that have anxiety,

50:36.540 --> 50:39.180
 learning problems, issues focusing,

50:39.180 --> 50:41.340
 the questions I usually get are, how can I focus better?

50:41.340 --> 50:43.040
 Well, we will get to that.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.020
 But one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms

50:46.020 --> 50:49.100
 for good mood, mental health, learning, focus,

50:49.100 --> 50:52.940
 metabolism, et cetera, is to take control

50:52.940 --> 50:55.660
 of this light exposure behavior at night

50:55.660 --> 50:58.740
 and not get much or any bright light exposure

50:58.740 --> 50:59.920
 in the middle of the night.

50:59.920 --> 51:02.580
 Red light won't trigger this pathway

51:02.580 --> 51:05.180
 but very few people have the kind of infrared lights

51:05.180 --> 51:07.260
 that are set up or floor lights.

51:07.260 --> 51:09.140
 And that brings me to an important point

51:09.140 --> 51:10.640
 which is about the location of light.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.560
 This hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think.

51:13.560 --> 51:16.180
 These cells in our eye, these neurons

51:16.180 --> 51:19.620
 that signal the central clock reside mostly,

51:19.620 --> 51:22.060
 not exclusively, but mostly in the bottom half

51:22.060 --> 51:23.100
 of our retina.

51:23.100 --> 51:25.740
 And because we have a lens in front of our retina

51:25.740 --> 51:27.840
 and because of the optics of lenses,

51:27.840 --> 51:30.380
 that means that these cells are actually viewing

51:30.380 --> 51:31.960
 our upper visual field.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.460
 There's an inversion of the visual image, et cetera.

51:34.460 --> 51:36.140
 You can look that up if you wanna learn more

51:36.140 --> 51:38.460
 about retinal optics, it's fascinating

51:38.460 --> 51:40.580
 but not the topic for today.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.940
 These cells are in the bottom half of your retina mostly

51:42.940 --> 51:47.940
 and so they're viewing the overhead visual space around you.

51:48.220 --> 51:50.840
 This is probably not coincidental

51:50.840 --> 51:54.260
 that these cells were essentially designed

51:54.260 --> 51:58.100
 to detect sunlight, which is overhead, of course.

51:58.100 --> 52:03.100
 So if you want to avoid improper activation

52:03.940 --> 52:07.700
 of these neurons, it's better to place lights

52:07.700 --> 52:10.780
 that you use in the evening low in your physical environment

52:10.780 --> 52:13.100
 so on desktops or even the floor,

52:13.100 --> 52:17.940
 if you wanna go that way, as opposed to overhead lights.

52:17.940 --> 52:20.900
 So overhead fluorescent lights would be the worst.

52:20.900 --> 52:23.300
 That would be the worst case scenario.

52:23.300 --> 52:25.740
 Lights that are overhead that are a little bit softer

52:25.740 --> 52:28.000
 of the sort of yellow or reddish tints

52:28.000 --> 52:29.040
 would be slightly better.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.660
 But dim lights that are set low in the room

52:31.660 --> 52:33.580
 are going to be best because they aren't going

52:33.580 --> 52:36.180
 to activate these neurons

52:36.180 --> 52:39.140
 and therefore shift your circadian clock.

52:39.140 --> 52:40.540
 So that's a goal.

52:40.540 --> 52:43.580
 Some people like Samir Hatar that I mentioned earlier,

52:43.580 --> 52:46.660
 he turns his home basically into a cave in the evenings.

52:46.660 --> 52:49.460
 Candlelight actually does not trigger

52:49.460 --> 52:50.660
 activation of these cells.

52:50.660 --> 52:55.660
 So candlelight and fireplaces and campfires are fine.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.260
 Dim lights, very dim lights are fine

52:58.260 --> 53:00.000
 and lights low in the physical environment.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.660
 Of course, the problem with candlelight and fireplaces

53:02.660 --> 53:05.260
 is the fire hazard, but you're smart people.

53:05.260 --> 53:07.620
 You know what to do about that.

53:07.620 --> 53:10.820
 Don't burn down whatever structure you're in,

53:10.820 --> 53:13.220
 including forests, please.

53:13.220 --> 53:16.840
 So keep the lights low in your environment.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.960
 What if you wake up in the middle of the night

53:18.960 --> 53:23.020
 and you find yourself watching TV or on the computer?

53:23.020 --> 53:25.780
 And well, in that case, you might want to wear blue blockers

53:25.780 --> 53:28.060
 and you certainly would want to dim the screen,

53:28.060 --> 53:29.580
 but ideally you're not doing that.

53:29.580 --> 53:32.620
 It's remarkable the positive effects

53:32.620 --> 53:34.600
 of getting that bit of sunlight early in the day,

53:34.600 --> 53:38.060
 maybe even also around sunset and avoiding bright lights

53:38.060 --> 53:40.520
 and especially overhead bright lights

53:40.520 --> 53:42.680
 between about 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.420
 Now I'm not talking about shift work.

53:44.420 --> 53:46.620
 I'm realizing that we're probably going to have to have

53:46.620 --> 53:49.360
 an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers

53:49.360 --> 53:50.820
 because there's some good information there

53:50.820 --> 53:52.700
 about how they can protect themselves

53:52.700 --> 53:56.300
 against some of the very bad health effects of shift work

53:56.300 --> 53:57.780
 of getting light in the middle of the night.

53:57.780 --> 54:00.660
 But we rely on shift workers and they're super important

54:00.660 --> 54:03.420
 to culture and society and the economy.

54:03.420 --> 54:05.540
 So I want to acknowledge them and let you know

54:05.540 --> 54:10.540
 that we will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag.

54:10.540 --> 54:14.300
 But let's talk about what light can do

54:14.300 --> 54:17.540
 in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.

54:17.540 --> 54:20.200
 So the way to think about this whole system,

54:20.200 --> 54:21.940
 again, is you've got adenosine building up

54:21.940 --> 54:24.040
 depending on how long you've been awake

54:24.040 --> 54:25.100
 and it's making you sleepy.

54:25.100 --> 54:26.780
 And then you've got the circadian mechanisms

54:26.780 --> 54:28.460
 that are timing your wakefulness

54:28.460 --> 54:30.060
 and timing when you want to be asleep,

54:30.060 --> 54:32.340
 mainly through cortisol and melatonin.

54:32.340 --> 54:33.420
 But there are a bunch of other things

54:33.420 --> 54:35.500
 that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin.

54:35.500 --> 54:40.040
 Like we tend to be hungrier during our wakeful period

54:40.040 --> 54:41.000
 than late at night.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.760
 Some people like to eat late at night,

54:42.760 --> 54:45.660
 but if you're finding that you can't become a day person

54:45.660 --> 54:48.860
 or a morning person, shifting your light exposure,

54:48.860 --> 54:52.900
 exercise and food intake to the daytime will help.

54:52.900 --> 54:56.720
 Some people like to stop eating around six or 8 p.m.

54:56.720 --> 54:58.900
 because of metabolic reasons

54:58.900 --> 55:01.300
 or they're trying to maintain their weight or lose weight.

55:01.300 --> 55:05.660
 That's actually not supported so well by the literature.

55:05.660 --> 55:07.460
 The literature around nutrition essentially says

55:07.460 --> 55:09.840
 that it's best to restrict your feeding

55:09.840 --> 55:12.080
 to a certain period of each 24 hour cycle

55:12.080 --> 55:14.140
 to not be eating around the clock.

55:14.140 --> 55:16.100
 And whether or not that's four hours or eight hours

55:16.100 --> 55:19.560
 or 16 hours is a much lengthier discussion

55:19.560 --> 55:20.580
 than we have time for now.

55:20.580 --> 55:23.500
 I would refer you to Sachin Panda's book,

55:23.500 --> 55:25.580
 The Circadian Code, which talks all about that.

55:25.580 --> 55:27.340
 He's an expert, a former colleague of mine

55:27.340 --> 55:29.700
 from the Salk Institute in San Diego.

55:29.700 --> 55:33.320
 You can explore intermittent and circadian fasting,

55:33.320 --> 55:35.540
 so to speak, through Sachin's literature.

55:35.540 --> 55:36.380
 We'll talk about that.

55:36.380 --> 55:37.540
 We might even get Sachin in here

55:37.540 --> 55:39.820
 if we're lucky at some point in the future.

55:39.820 --> 55:43.340
 But you can actually use light to wake up earlier.

55:43.340 --> 55:46.400
 Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study

55:46.400 --> 55:51.400
 showing that if you turn on the lights before waking up,

55:51.660 --> 55:54.820
 so around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up,

55:54.820 --> 55:56.340
 even if your eyelids are closed,

55:56.340 --> 55:58.640
 provided you're not under the covers,

55:59.860 --> 56:01.700
 after doing that for a few days,

56:01.700 --> 56:04.420
 that increases your total sleep time

56:04.420 --> 56:07.380
 and shifts forward the time at which you feel sleepy.

56:07.380 --> 56:10.700
 It makes you want to go to bed earlier each night.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.160
 Now, in a kind of a diabolical way,

56:13.160 --> 56:15.700
 they did this with teenagers who are notorious

56:15.700 --> 56:17.460
 for wanting to wake up late and stay up late.

56:17.460 --> 56:19.940
 And what they found was bright light flashes,

56:19.940 --> 56:21.400
 just turning on the lights in their environment,

56:21.400 --> 56:22.240
 overhead lights,

56:22.240 --> 56:24.060
 because they're trying to activate the system,

56:24.060 --> 56:26.500
 and that's why they're using overhead lights.

56:26.500 --> 56:30.100
 Even through the eyelids, before these kids woke up,

56:30.100 --> 56:32.660
 then made those kids naturally want to go to bed earlier

56:32.660 --> 56:34.180
 and they ended up sleeping longer.

56:34.180 --> 56:35.200
 So that's something you could try.

56:35.200 --> 56:38.260
 You could put your lights on a timer to go on

56:38.260 --> 56:40.980
 early in the day before you wake up.

56:40.980 --> 56:44.260
 You could open your blind so that sunlight is coming through.

56:44.260 --> 56:46.540
 And again, if you curl up under the covers,

56:46.540 --> 56:49.300
 then it's not going to reach these neurons,

56:49.300 --> 56:51.380
 but it's remarkable the light can actually penetrate

56:51.380 --> 56:53.100
 the eyelids, activate these neurons,

56:53.100 --> 56:54.500
 and go to the central clock.

56:55.420 --> 56:57.940
 That study illustrates a really important principle

56:57.940 --> 56:58.900
 of how you're built,

56:58.900 --> 57:01.900
 which is you have the capacity for what are called

57:01.900 --> 57:05.020
 phase advances and phase delays.

57:05.020 --> 57:07.140
 And I don't want to complicate this too much.

57:07.140 --> 57:10.480
 So the simplest way to think about phase advances

57:10.480 --> 57:15.480
 and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day,

57:15.620 --> 57:17.860
 and in particular in the middle of the night,

57:17.860 --> 57:22.300
 your brain and body for reasons that now you understand

57:22.300 --> 57:24.380
 will think that that's morning light,

57:24.380 --> 57:25.540
 even though it's not sunlight

57:25.540 --> 57:27.120
 because you have this heightened sensitivity,

57:27.120 --> 57:28.460
 and it will phase delay,

57:28.460 --> 57:29.860
 it will delay your clock.

57:29.860 --> 57:32.020
 It will essentially make you want to get up later

57:32.020 --> 57:33.740
 and go to sleep later.

57:33.740 --> 57:36.500
 So if you get light exposure too late in the evening

57:36.500 --> 57:37.900
 or in the middle of the night,

57:37.900 --> 57:40.140
 it's going to make it hard to want to wake up

57:40.140 --> 57:42.820
 the next morning early and to go to bed early.

57:44.340 --> 57:45.940
 The opposite is also true.

57:46.900 --> 57:49.620
 If you wake up early,

57:49.620 --> 57:54.300
 say 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and get light exposure,

57:54.300 --> 57:57.260
 or even earlier, 4 a.m., and get light exposure,

57:57.260 --> 58:00.060
 it will phase advance your clock, okay?

58:00.060 --> 58:02.580
 It's going to make your clock think it's earlier

58:02.580 --> 58:04.340
 and you'll want to wake up earlier.

58:04.340 --> 58:06.700
 So the simple way to think about this

58:06.700 --> 58:08.820
 is if you're having trouble waking up early

58:08.820 --> 58:11.660
 and feeling alert early in the day,

58:11.660 --> 58:14.260
 you're going to want to try and get bright light exposure

58:14.260 --> 58:17.540
 even before waking up because it will advance your clock.

58:17.540 --> 58:20.180
 It's sort of like turning the clock forward.

58:20.180 --> 58:22.700
 Whereas if you are having trouble waking up early,

58:22.700 --> 58:25.900
 you definitely don't want to get too much light exposure

58:25.900 --> 58:29.360
 or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening

58:29.360 --> 58:30.220
 and in the middle of the night

58:30.220 --> 58:33.140
 because it's just going to delay your clock more and more.

58:33.140 --> 58:35.420
 So rather than get into the specifics

58:35.420 --> 58:36.680
 of everybody's situation,

58:36.680 --> 58:38.020
 because there are many of you out there

58:38.020 --> 58:39.180
 with different situations

58:39.180 --> 58:42.340
 and lifestyle requirements, et cetera,

58:42.340 --> 58:43.960
 the way to think about this

58:43.960 --> 58:46.220
 is that you have these internal mechanisms

58:46.220 --> 58:47.960
 of adenosine and circadian clocks,

58:47.960 --> 58:49.580
 and they're always operating.

58:49.580 --> 58:52.420
 And what you're trying to do is provide them anchors.

58:52.420 --> 58:55.860
 You're trying to provide them consistent, powerful anchors

58:55.860 --> 58:59.240
 so that your cortisol, your melatonin,

58:59.240 --> 59:02.420
 and then everything that cascades down from that,

59:02.420 --> 59:05.140
 like your metabolism and your ability to learn

59:05.140 --> 59:08.220
 and your sense of alertness, your dopamine, your serotonin,

59:08.220 --> 59:11.580
 all that stuff is timed regularly.

59:11.580 --> 59:16.580
 One of the reasons why there's so much challenge out there

59:16.840 --> 59:19.980
 with focus and anxiety and depression,

59:19.980 --> 59:21.260
 there are a lot of reasons for that,

59:21.260 --> 59:25.380
 but one of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms

59:25.380 --> 59:27.640
 aren't anchored to anything regular.

59:27.640 --> 59:30.620
 Now, this doesn't require being neurotically attached

59:30.620 --> 59:32.380
 to getting up at a very specific time,

59:32.380 --> 59:35.220
 going outside, viewing the sunlight, same time every day.

59:35.220 --> 59:36.760
 These systems, again, will average,

59:36.760 --> 59:39.860
 but if you can provide them consistent light anchors

59:39.860 --> 59:41.760
 early in the day and in the evening

59:41.760 --> 59:43.320
 and avoiding light at night,

59:43.320 --> 59:45.700
 you will be amazed at the tremendous number

59:45.700 --> 59:47.980
 of positive effects that can come from that

59:47.980 --> 59:50.980
 at the level of metabolic factors, hormones,

59:50.980 --> 59:53.420
 and just general feelings of wellbeing.

59:53.420 --> 59:56.300
 In fact, most of us are familiar

59:56.300 --> 59:58.340
 with what it is to not sleep well

59:58.340 --> 59:59.960
 and all the terrible effects that has.

59:59.960 --> 1:00:01.180
 Maybe one night you're fine,

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:04.220
 two nights even for the new parents out there,

1:00:04.220 --> 1:00:06.120
 I sympathize with you,

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:09.540
 but most people are not familiar with what it is

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:13.380
 to sleep really, really well on a consistent basis.

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:15.140
 And when you start doing that

1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:17.000
 by controlling your sleep environment, right,

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.780
 get the proper sleep surface, get the proper pillow,

1:00:19.780 --> 1:00:21.800
 get the temperature in the room right,

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.760
 get your light exposure right,

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.720
 start timing your exercise at normal periods or times

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:28.780
 throughout the day and week.

1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:31.340
 It's amazing how many other biological systems

1:00:31.340 --> 1:00:33.100
 just naturally fall in line.

1:00:33.100 --> 1:00:35.900
 And this is why whenever people ask me,

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:36.760
 what should I take,

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:38.460
 which is one of the most common questions I get,

1:00:38.460 --> 1:00:39.540
 what supplements should I take?

1:00:39.540 --> 1:00:40.700
 What drugs should I be taking?

1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:42.280
 What things should I be taking?

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:47.280
 The first question I always ask them is, how's your sleep?

1:00:47.460 --> 1:00:49.560
 And 90% of the time they tell me

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.760
 they either have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep,

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:54.380
 or they don't feel rested throughout the day.

1:00:54.380 --> 1:00:56.600
 A brief note about naps.

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:59.620
 Naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian cycle,

1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:02.540
 provided they're 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour,

1:01:02.540 --> 1:01:04.620
 can be very beneficial for a lot of people.

1:01:04.620 --> 1:01:06.260
 You don't have to take them,

1:01:06.260 --> 1:01:09.020
 but many people naturally feel a dip in energy

1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:10.620
 and focus late in the afternoon.

1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:12.740
 In fact, if we were gonna look at wakefulness,

1:01:12.740 --> 1:01:13.760
 what we would find is that

1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:15.020
 you get that morning light exposure,

1:01:15.020 --> 1:01:16.420
 hopefully your cortisol goes up,

1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:17.500
 people will start feeling awake,

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:19.820
 and then around two or three or four in the afternoon,

1:01:19.820 --> 1:01:23.420
 there's a spike in everything from alertness

1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:26.420
 to ability to learn, some metabolic factors drop,

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:28.540
 and then it just naturally comes back up,

1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:31.180
 and then it tapers off as the night goes on.

1:01:31.180 --> 1:01:33.720
 So for some of you, naps are great.

1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:35.320
 I love taking naps.

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:38.400
 Some people, they wake up from naps feeling really groggy.

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:41.320
 That's probably because they're not sleeping as well

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:42.500
 as they should at night,

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:43.700
 or as long as they should at night,

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:46.340
 and so they're dropping into REM sleep

1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:49.100
 or deeper forms of sleep in the daytime.

1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:51.240
 And then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented.

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:52.860
 Other people feel great after a nap.

1:01:52.860 --> 1:01:55.440
 So that's another case where just like with caffeine,

1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:57.960
 you sort of have to evaluate for yourself.

1:01:57.960 --> 1:01:59.580
 As we discuss this, you're probably realizing

1:01:59.580 --> 1:02:01.140
 this is a lot like nutrition,

1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:02.660
 where nowadays it's just crazy.

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.220
 I mean, if you go on social media,

1:02:04.220 --> 1:02:06.340
 it's like you've got people who are pushing carnivore,

1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:08.260
 you've got other people who are pushing vegan,

1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:11.040
 other people who are pushing paleo,

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:12.980
 every variation of every diet.

1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:15.920
 And there's a lot of data to support any and all of those,

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:17.300
 and the arguments go on and on.

1:02:17.300 --> 1:02:19.460
 And there's probably a lot of genetic variation

1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:21.900
 and lifestyle variation that's going to dictate

1:02:21.900 --> 1:02:23.420
 whether or not something is good for you,

1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:24.260
 whether or not you like it,

1:02:24.260 --> 1:02:26.020
 whether or not you'll stick to it.

1:02:26.020 --> 1:02:29.780
 The same thing is true for circadian

1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:32.660
 and sleep and wakefulness behaviors,

1:02:32.660 --> 1:02:34.340
 except the light viewing behavior

1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:35.380
 that I talked about before.

1:02:35.380 --> 1:02:36.320
 There's no way around that.

1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:37.840
 That's hardwired into our system.

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:41.180
 The same way we could factually say

1:02:41.180 --> 1:02:44.580
 that everybody needs some nutrition at some level

1:02:44.580 --> 1:02:47.460
 from some source, everybody needs light information

1:02:47.460 --> 1:02:51.660
 arriving in their system in some way at regular intervals.

1:02:51.660 --> 1:02:54.020
 So that's really what this is about.

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:55.380
 Okay, so naps are going to be good

1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:56.700
 for some people, not for others.

1:02:56.700 --> 1:02:59.240
 I have a colleague, a very accomplished neuroscientist

1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:02.800
 who likes to take naps just after lunch.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:06.100
 I personally like to take a nap around three or 4 p.m.,

1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:08.180
 but there's a practice that I've adopted

1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:09.780
 in the last five years

1:03:09.780 --> 1:03:12.340
 that I've found to be immensely beneficial

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.300
 that is sort of like napping, but isn't napping.

1:03:15.300 --> 1:03:18.700
 It's a thing that they call yoga nidra.

1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:20.980
 Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:23.740
 And it's a sort of meditation that you listen to.

1:03:23.740 --> 1:03:24.780
 There are a number of scripts.

1:03:24.780 --> 1:03:26.420
 I've talked about this on podcasts before,

1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:29.660
 but I'm going to post a link to the two that I like most

1:03:29.660 --> 1:03:34.660
 that allows you to consciously bring your entire body

1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:38.100
 and mind into a state of deep relaxation.

1:03:38.100 --> 1:03:41.180
 And sometimes you fall asleep and sometimes you don't.

1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:46.140
 This is done for 10 to 30 or even 60 minutes at a time.

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:49.220
 The other thing that works really well is meditation.

1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:51.100
 So I'm talking about naps,

1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:52.700
 but I'm also talking about yoga nidra,

1:03:52.700 --> 1:03:54.460
 which is sort of a form of meditation,

1:03:54.460 --> 1:03:57.460
 and then more standard forms of meditation.

1:03:57.460 --> 1:04:00.140
 All three of those do something powerful,

1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:02.220
 which is that they bring our mind

1:04:02.220 --> 1:04:04.020
 into a state of less so-called

1:04:04.020 --> 1:04:05.980
 sympathetic nervous system activation.

1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:07.660
 Go back and listen to episode one

1:04:07.660 --> 1:04:08.820
 if that doesn't make any sense,

1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:10.460
 which is what governs your alertness.

1:04:10.460 --> 1:04:14.440
 And instead it activates cells and circuits in your body

1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:16.940
 that promote the parasympathetic nervous system

1:04:16.940 --> 1:04:18.660
 or the calming system.

1:04:18.660 --> 1:04:20.880
 A lot of people are not good at falling asleep

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:23.780
 because they're not good at calming down.

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:26.140
 So some people have no trouble falling asleep,

1:04:26.140 --> 1:04:28.580
 but many people have a hard time falling asleep

1:04:28.580 --> 1:04:30.020
 or at least every once in a while

1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:32.260
 experience challenges falling asleep.

1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:35.040
 I don't have problems falling asleep most nights,

1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:37.100
 but I've noticed that if I'm working very hard

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:39.000
 or if the world is particularly stressful,

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.380
 my mind gets into a bit of a kind of OCD loop

1:04:41.380 --> 1:04:42.820
 where I tend to ruminate on things.

1:04:42.820 --> 1:04:44.820
 And I'm not even thinking about anything in particular.

1:04:44.820 --> 1:04:48.180
 It's just challenging for me to disengage and fall asleep.

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.540
 Meditation and yoga nidra scripts

1:04:50.540 --> 1:04:52.540
 have been immensely helpful for me

1:04:52.540 --> 1:04:55.880
 in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep.

1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:58.740
 So they involve taking a few minutes,

1:04:58.740 --> 1:05:01.460
 10 to 30 minutes or so, just like you would for a nap,

1:05:01.460 --> 1:05:04.500
 and just listening to a script almost passively.

1:05:04.500 --> 1:05:07.700
 And it has you do some particular patterns of breathing

1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:10.580
 and some other kind of body scan-like things

1:05:10.580 --> 1:05:13.100
 that can really help people learn to relax,

1:05:13.100 --> 1:05:16.100
 not just in that moment, but get better at relaxing

1:05:16.100 --> 1:05:18.660
 and turning off thinking in order to fall asleep

1:05:18.660 --> 1:05:20.660
 when they want to do that at night.

1:05:20.660 --> 1:05:22.320
 There's another thing that's similar to this,

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:25.000
 which is certain forms of hypnosis for sleep.

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.820
 For that, I'll just refer you to the website

1:05:26.820 --> 1:05:30.600
 of a colleague and collaborator of mine, David Spiegel,

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:33.040
 who's our Associate Chair of Psychiatry

1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:35.540
 and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.

1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:38.180
 He's developed a website, which is reverie,

1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:43.180
 R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com, so reveriehealth.com,

1:05:43.580 --> 1:05:46.260
 that has a lot of science-supported,

1:05:46.260 --> 1:05:49.340
 clinically-supported hypnosis scripts

1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:50.700
 that essentially take the brain

1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:53.100
 into states of deep relaxation

1:05:53.100 --> 1:05:55.820
 for sake of rewiring the brain and neuroplasticity.

1:05:55.820 --> 1:05:57.400
 But one of those scripts that's there

1:05:57.400 --> 1:05:59.900
 and is available free is for sleep.

1:05:59.900 --> 1:06:01.940
 And we'll talk more about hypnosis at a later time

1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:04.280
 because it has a ton of other effects

1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:06.200
 that aren't just limited to sleep.

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:10.140
 So a period of time each day that you devote

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:12.420
 to getting better at falling and staying asleep

1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:15.100
 is actually a really good practice to adopt.

1:06:15.100 --> 1:06:17.840
 The other thing about these practices like meditation,

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:21.140
 yoga nidra, and hypnosis is people always say to me,

1:06:21.140 --> 1:06:22.160
 well, when should I do them?

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:24.700
 And I always say, well, the best time of day to do it is

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:26.060
 when you first wake up in the morning,

1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:28.460
 provided you've gotten your sunlight already,

1:06:28.460 --> 1:06:30.060
 anytime you wake up in the middle of the night

1:06:30.060 --> 1:06:30.920
 or any time of day.

1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:32.860
 In other words, they're always good for you

1:06:32.860 --> 1:06:34.460
 because it's a training mechanism

1:06:34.460 --> 1:06:36.740
 by which you self-train your nervous system

1:06:36.740 --> 1:06:39.260
 to go from a state of heightened alertness

1:06:39.260 --> 1:06:42.060
 that you don't want to heightened relaxation

1:06:42.060 --> 1:06:43.420
 that you do want.

1:06:43.420 --> 1:06:46.300
 And so it's really teaching you to hit the brake.

1:06:46.300 --> 1:06:48.960
 And that brings us to an even more important point perhaps,

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:51.520
 which is we've all experienced

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:54.300
 that we can stay up if we want to, right?

1:06:54.300 --> 1:06:56.880
 If we wanna stay up late on New Year's

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:58.260
 or we wanna push an all-nighter,

1:06:58.260 --> 1:07:00.780
 some people can do that more easily than others,

1:07:00.780 --> 1:07:03.340
 but we're all capable of doing that.

1:07:03.340 --> 1:07:05.860
 But it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep.

1:07:05.860 --> 1:07:07.680
 And so there's a sort of asymmetry

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.620
 to the way our autonomic nervous system,

1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:11.820
 which governs this alertness calmness thing,

1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:14.300
 the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system,

1:07:14.300 --> 1:07:17.680
 there's an asymmetry there where we are more easily able

1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:20.500
 to engage wakefulness and drive wakefulness.

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:22.660
 We can force ourselves to stay awake.

1:07:22.660 --> 1:07:26.380
 Then we are able to force ourselves to fall asleep.

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:29.340
 And one of the things that I say over and over again,

1:07:29.340 --> 1:07:31.480
 and I'm gonna continue to say over and over again,

1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:34.440
 is it's very hard to control the mind with the mind.

1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:36.260
 When you have trouble falling asleep,

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:39.240
 you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body.

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:42.040
 And all the things I described, meditation, hypnosis,

1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:46.720
 yoga nidra, all involve exhale emphasized breathing,

1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.780
 certain ways of lying down and controlling the body.

1:07:49.780 --> 1:07:51.080
 We're gonna get into breathing

1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:53.080
 in real depth at another time.

1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:56.580
 But all of those involve using the body to control the mind

1:07:56.580 --> 1:08:00.060
 rather than trying to wrestle your mind

1:08:00.060 --> 1:08:02.600
 into a certain pattern of relaxation.

1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:07.600
 So earlier in episode one, I talked about the Mobius strip,

1:08:07.820 --> 1:08:11.220
 this continuous loop that is the brain-body relationship

1:08:11.220 --> 1:08:13.020
 or the mind-body relationship.

1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:15.120
 And when we're having trouble controlling the mind,

1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:17.620
 I encourage people to look towards the body,

1:08:17.620 --> 1:08:20.720
 look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:22.580
 if that happens to be late at night.

1:08:22.580 --> 1:08:24.760
 So there's a theme that's starting to emerge,

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:26.100
 which is in order to control this thing

1:08:26.100 --> 1:08:27.520
 that we call the nervous system,

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:29.720
 we have to look back to some of the things

1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:32.960
 we discussed earlier, like sensation, perception, et cetera.

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:35.140
 But we have to ask, what can we control?

1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:37.740
 Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure,

1:08:37.740 --> 1:08:40.000
 controlling your breathing and body.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.460
 I'm not going into details right now,

1:08:41.460 --> 1:08:43.140
 but you can see the yoga nidra script

1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:46.900
 or the reveriehealth.com or Headspace would be a great place

1:08:46.900 --> 1:08:49.400
 to adopt the meditation practice.

1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:52.060
 Any of those are really teaching you to use your body

1:08:52.060 --> 1:08:54.420
 to control your mind and to allow you

1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:56.760
 to explore the mind-body relationship in a way

1:08:56.760 --> 1:08:59.740
 that gives you more control over your mind

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:02.300
 and the mind-body relationship, okay?

1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:04.620
 So we talked about light,

1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:07.180
 we talked about activity and timing of light,

1:09:07.180 --> 1:09:09.140
 talked about the usefulness of naps

1:09:09.140 --> 1:09:12.380
 and these things that I'm calling non-sleep deep rest,

1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:16.860
 which include meditation, yoga nidra and hypnosis.

1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:20.280
 Non-sleep deep rest, or what I hear after

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:23.140
 we will refer to as NSDR,

1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:24.980
 not to be confused with EMDR,

1:09:24.980 --> 1:09:26.620
 I don't think I've ever heard NSDR,

1:09:26.620 --> 1:09:31.620
 so I'm planting a flag for NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:36.280
 as a way to reset one's ability to be awake

1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:38.100
 after you emerge from NSDR,

1:09:38.100 --> 1:09:40.580
 so to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend,

1:09:40.580 --> 1:09:43.520
 some emotional stability reset,

1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:47.640
 as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:49.440
 when you wanna go to sleep at night.

1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:52.180
 Now, non-sleep deep rest does have some research

1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:53.140
 to support it.

1:09:53.140 --> 1:09:54.940
 There's a beautiful study done

1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:56.940
 out of a university in Denmark,

1:09:56.940 --> 1:09:59.660
 I will later provide a link to that study,

1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:02.380
 that showed that this meditation

1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:05.220
 and yoga nidra type meditation

1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:08.100
 allows dopamine and other neuromodulators

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.740
 in an area of the brain called the striatum

1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:13.000
 that's involved in motor planning and motor execution,

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.340
 to reset itself.

1:10:14.340 --> 1:10:17.860
 In other words, this NSDR can reset our ability

1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:21.580
 to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate,

1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:22.940
 not to throw in another acronym,

1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:26.180
 but NSDR resets your ability to engage in DPOs,

1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:27.800
 duration, path, and outcome.

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:29.240
 So now you're probably rolling your eyes,

1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:30.900
 like, oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,

1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:35.900
 but just bear with me because NSDR is so powerful

1:10:36.140 --> 1:10:37.500
 because first of all,

1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:41.340
 it doesn't require that you rig yourself to any device,

1:10:41.340 --> 1:10:44.420
 it doesn't require that you take much time out of your day,

1:10:44.420 --> 1:10:47.780
 it doesn't require that you ingest anything except air,

1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:51.240
 and it can have so many positive effects,

1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:53.400
 right down to the neuromodulator level.

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:54.900
 So I think in the years to come,

1:10:54.900 --> 1:10:57.120
 my lab's exploring this in collaboration

1:10:57.120 --> 1:10:58.420
 with David Spiegel's lab,

1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:00.060
 but other labs are looking at this as well.

1:11:00.060 --> 1:11:04.040
 I think NSDR is going to start to play a more prominent role

1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:06.120
 in what we call wellness and health,

1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:07.540
 both mental health and physical health.

1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:09.940
 So I encourage you to explore those practices.

1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:13.300
 Okay, so what about things that we can and maybe should

1:11:13.300 --> 1:11:15.880
 or should not take in order to control

1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.860
 and access better sleep and better wakefulness?

1:11:18.860 --> 1:11:22.820
 We've talked about things you can do or not do.

1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:26.260
 We've talked about nutrition and the timing of nutrition.

1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:27.660
 Now let's talk about compounds.

1:11:27.660 --> 1:11:29.100
 Those could be prescription drugs,

1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:30.820
 those could be supplements.

1:11:30.820 --> 1:11:31.880
 There are a number of different things

1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:36.060
 that will affect your circadian timing and behavior.

1:11:36.060 --> 1:11:40.460
 In fact, almost everything that you could take

1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:44.020
 will affect your circadian timing and behavior.

1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:44.860
 That's right.

1:11:44.860 --> 1:11:47.480
 So years ago, when I was in graduate school,

1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:48.320
 I had a professor,

1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:49.440
 unfortunately he passed away now,

1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:52.100
 but his name was Ted Jones, the late Edward Jones,

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:53.900
 who was a world-class neuroanatomist.

1:11:53.900 --> 1:11:55.820
 He wrote the book on the thalamus,

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:57.460
 in fact, it's called The Thalamus,

1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.980
 and an expert on patterns of activation

1:11:59.980 --> 1:12:01.500
 in the brain during sleep.

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:03.980
 And I'll never forget that during one of these lectures,

1:12:03.980 --> 1:12:06.300
 someone asked Ted the question,

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:08.300
 what is the effect of some drug

1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:11.340
 on these waves of activity in the thalamus or something?

1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:13.420
 And his answer was incredible.

1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:15.420
 He was a pretty gruff guy.

1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.180
 And so his answer was delivered

1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:19.460
 in the form of a kind of aggressive direct statement.

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:22.460
 He said, a drug is a substance

1:12:22.460 --> 1:12:24.460
 that when injected into a person

1:12:24.460 --> 1:12:26.940
 produces a scientific publication.

1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:29.820
 And what he was saying is actually quite true,

1:12:29.820 --> 1:12:32.860
 which is that most every compound

1:12:32.860 --> 1:12:36.180
 will have some effect on some aspect of biology.

1:12:36.180 --> 1:12:37.900
 This is why it's hard to sort through everything

1:12:37.900 --> 1:12:38.740
 that's on PubMed.

1:12:38.740 --> 1:12:43.500
 If you put any molecule or compound or drug into PubMed,

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:47.120
 and then you put sleep next to it or alertness next to it,

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:49.900
 you're likely to find a paper where there's an effect.

1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:53.380
 But that's not necessarily telling you

1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:55.820
 that that drug is useful or helpful for that.

1:12:55.820 --> 1:12:59.440
 What it's telling you is that anytime you change

1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:02.700
 what you take or you stop taking something,

1:13:02.700 --> 1:13:03.960
 say you're taking sleeping pills,

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.220
 Ambien or whatever it is, and you stop taking them,

1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.740
 your sleep behavior will change.

1:13:08.740 --> 1:13:10.000
 Let's say you take an aspirin,

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:11.100
 you don't normally take aspirin,

1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:13.280
 you will shift your circadian rhythm.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.200
 Now you might not shift it perceptibly,

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:17.100
 you might not create problems for yourself,

1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:20.820
 but anytime you ingest a compound at high potency,

1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:24.100
 you're going to provide some shift to your circadian rhythm.

1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:25.980
 Now, that said, there are a couple of things

1:13:25.980 --> 1:13:28.220
 that are directly in line with the biology

1:13:28.220 --> 1:13:29.900
 related to falling and staying asleep

1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:32.940
 and directly in line with the biology of wakefulness.

1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:36.440
 There's a whole category of things like stimulants,

1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:39.540
 cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants,

1:13:40.620 --> 1:13:42.060
 the prescription ones were designed

1:13:42.060 --> 1:13:43.420
 for the treatment of narcolepsy.

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:46.740
 So things like modafinil or armodafinil

1:13:46.740 --> 1:13:48.140
 that are designed to create wakefulness,

1:13:48.140 --> 1:13:52.680
 they are all essentially chemical variants

1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:55.580
 of things that increase epinephrine and dopamine.

1:13:55.580 --> 1:13:58.100
 Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint

1:13:58.100 --> 1:13:59.620
 that things like cocaine and amphetamine

1:13:59.620 --> 1:14:01.140
 are just across the board bad,

1:14:01.140 --> 1:14:04.040
 they have so many addictive and terrible effects.

1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:08.060
 In the proper setting prescribed by the proper professional,

1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:12.300
 things like modafinil for narcolepsy might be appropriate.

1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:15.560
 I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall,

1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:18.060
 even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall

1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:20.380
 in order to increase wakefulness.

1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:24.020
 That is essentially, well, it's illegal for one,

1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:26.100
 but it's also, it's abusing the system

1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:27.500
 in the sense that you're pushing back

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:29.420
 on the adenosine system slightly differently

1:14:29.420 --> 1:14:31.100
 than you do caffeine.

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:32.340
 It will make you feel more alert.

1:14:32.340 --> 1:14:33.560
 There tends to be a heavy rebound

1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:35.340
 and they do have an addictive potential.

1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:36.900
 There are also some other effects of those

1:14:36.900 --> 1:14:37.740
 that can be quite bad.

1:14:37.740 --> 1:14:40.020
 So we're going to explore stimulants

1:14:40.020 --> 1:14:42.820
 in a whole month related to drugs,

1:14:42.820 --> 1:14:44.900
 but there are some supplements and some things

1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:48.300
 that are safer, certainly safer,

1:14:48.300 --> 1:14:51.140
 and that in cases where you're doing

1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:52.200
 all the right behaviors,

1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:54.720
 you're exercising and eating correctly,

1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:56.420
 and you're still having trouble with sleep,

1:14:56.420 --> 1:15:00.020
 that can be beneficial for falling and staying asleep.

1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:01.080
 Now, I want to be very clear.

1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:02.540
 I am not pushing supplements.

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:04.780
 I'm just pointing you towards some things

1:15:04.780 --> 1:15:07.340
 that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies

1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:08.380
 to have some benefit.

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.820
 The first one is magnesium.

1:15:11.820 --> 1:15:13.340
 There are many forms of magnesium,

1:15:13.340 --> 1:15:16.740
 but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects

1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:18.860
 on sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep,

1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:23.620
 mainly by way of increasing neurotransmitters like GABA,

1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:26.780
 which help turn off the DPO,

1:15:26.780 --> 1:15:28.260
 the kind of thinking about the future,

1:15:28.260 --> 1:15:29.860
 duration path outcome analysis,

1:15:29.860 --> 1:15:34.860
 and make one's mind kind of drift in space and time

1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:36.700
 and make it easier to fall asleep.

1:15:36.700 --> 1:15:38.480
 There are a lot of forms of magnesium out there,

1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.480
 but one in particular is magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:47.300
 which you have to check to see if this is right for you,

1:15:47.300 --> 1:15:48.420
 check with your doctor,

1:15:48.420 --> 1:15:51.420
 but magnesium threonate is associated with transporters

1:15:51.420 --> 1:15:54.480
 in the body that bring more of it into cells

1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.340
 that allow people to feel this kind of drowsiness

1:15:57.340 --> 1:15:58.380
 and help them fall asleep.

1:15:58.380 --> 1:16:01.100
 So I personally, I can only talk about what I personally do.

1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:03.720
 I personally take three or 400 milligrams

1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:07.380
 of magnesium threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,

1:16:07.380 --> 1:16:08.820
 and it helps me fall asleep.

1:16:08.820 --> 1:16:13.820
 The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,

1:16:17.780 --> 1:16:20.140
 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine for me

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:22.980
 also helps me turn off my mind and fall asleep.

1:16:22.980 --> 1:16:24.940
 I take it 30 to 60 minutes throughout the day.

1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:27.340
 Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced

1:16:27.340 --> 1:16:29.300
 to a lot of energy drinks

1:16:29.300 --> 1:16:32.320
 in order to take away the jitters that are associated

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:33.900
 with drinking too much caffeine

1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:36.100
 or with some other things that are in the energy drinks.

1:16:36.100 --> 1:16:39.140
 Energy drinks can be problematic.

1:16:39.140 --> 1:16:41.780
 They can contain a lot of L-Taurine.

1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:42.780
 I'll just tell you an anecdote.

1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:43.620
 When I was a postdoc,

1:16:43.620 --> 1:16:45.780
 I was drinking a lot of a particular energy drink,

1:16:45.780 --> 1:16:47.820
 has a lot of taurine in it.

1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:51.860
 And actually the whites of my eyes, the sclera,

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:54.440
 as it's called in my eyes, turned beet red.

1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:57.680
 And I went to a friend who's an ophthalmologist.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:59.780
 I said, look, I'm not a marijuana smoker.

1:16:59.780 --> 1:17:00.900
 I haven't been hit on the head.

1:17:00.900 --> 1:17:01.980
 I don't know what's going on.

1:17:01.980 --> 1:17:03.060
 And he looked and he said,

1:17:03.060 --> 1:17:06.380
 I think you've got some microvascular damage.

1:17:06.380 --> 1:17:08.420
 And we walked through what I was taking and doing.

1:17:08.420 --> 1:17:10.420
 And he said, oh, it's probably the taurine,

1:17:10.420 --> 1:17:11.580
 excessive levels of taurine

1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:13.880
 can create some microvascular damage.

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:15.920
 So if you're having the microvascular damage in your eye,

1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:18.280
 you'll probably have microvascular damage deeper

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:19.120
 in your skull.

1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:19.940
 So I stopped.

1:17:19.940 --> 1:17:21.740
 That's the reason why I don't take energy drinks.

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:23.940
 So just a consideration.

1:17:23.940 --> 1:17:25.900
 Again, I'm not here to tell you what to do or not do,

1:17:25.900 --> 1:17:28.120
 but just want to arm you with information.

1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:33.120
 The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together.

1:17:33.800 --> 1:17:35.400
 They do, for some people,

1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:38.200
 they can make them so sleepy and sleep so deeply

1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:39.960
 that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning.

1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:42.140
 So you have to play with these things and titrate them

1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:43.240
 if you decide to use them.

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:44.780
 Again, if you decide to go this route.

1:17:44.780 --> 1:17:47.080
 I would not start by taking supplements.

1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:50.420
 I would start by getting your light viewing behavior correct

1:17:50.420 --> 1:17:52.000
 and then think about your nutrition

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.280
 and then think about your activity

1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:55.760
 and then think about whether or not you want a supplement.

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.860
 We already talked about melatonin earlier.

1:17:57.860 --> 1:17:59.820
 There's another supplement that could be quite useful,

1:17:59.820 --> 1:18:03.700
 which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,

1:18:03.700 --> 1:18:05.680
 which is a derivative chamomile.

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:09.400
 50 milligrams of apigenin also can augment

1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:13.160
 or support this kind of creation of a sleepiness

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:15.400
 to help fall asleep and stay asleep.

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:16.600
 A note about sleepwalkers

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:19.120
 and people with very vivid dreams.

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.720
 Theanine can often make your dreams very vivid.

1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:24.400
 Sleepwalkers should be careful about taking theanine.

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:26.800
 Everyone should be careful about taking anything

1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:28.560
 and don't take anything without consulting

1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:31.840
 your board certified MD or healthcare professional first.

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:33.100
 Okay?

1:18:33.100 --> 1:18:34.720
 Your health is your responsibility.

1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.120
 I am not going to take responsibility

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:38.740
 for what you decide to do experimentally in any case,

1:18:38.740 --> 1:18:41.640
 but especially as it relates to supplementation and drugs.

1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:44.880
 As a important point,

1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:48.560
 apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor.

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.280
 So women who want to keep their estrogen levels high

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:54.200
 or at whatever levels they happen to be at

1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:56.720
 should probably avoid apigenin altogether.

1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:00.320
 And men take that into consideration as well.

1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:01.580
 Men need estrogen also.

1:19:01.580 --> 1:19:03.960
 You don't want to completely eliminate your estrogen.

1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:05.640
 That it can create all sorts of bad effects

1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:08.220
 on libido and cognition, et cetera.

1:19:08.220 --> 1:19:10.240
 So apigenin in some people

1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:12.080
 is going to be a pretty strong estrogen inhibitor.

1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:13.640
 So keep that in mind.

1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:17.460
 There are other things you can take to help you sleep better.

1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:20.240
 Those are the legal ones that at least I'm aware of

1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:21.760
 have pretty broad safety margins.

1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:24.300
 But again, you need to explore your safety margins

1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:25.340
 with any compound.

1:19:25.340 --> 1:19:29.120
 I think a great website that I can refer you to

1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:30.780
 is examine.com.

1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:33.620
 Examine the word, just as it sounds,.com is a website.

1:19:33.620 --> 1:19:35.060
 I have no relation to them,

1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:38.660
 but there you can find links to peer-reviewed studies

1:19:38.660 --> 1:19:40.140
 for any compound or supplement,

1:19:40.140 --> 1:19:41.800
 as well as some important warnings

1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:43.360
 related to the things I discussed,

1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:44.860
 as well as any other thing

1:19:44.860 --> 1:19:48.020
 that you might decide to supplement with or ingest

1:19:48.020 --> 1:19:49.520
 to help improve your sleep.

1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:51.620
 Okay.

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:53.100
 That was a lot of information

1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:56.860
 about how to get better at sleeping, falling asleep,

1:19:56.860 --> 1:19:58.740
 wakefulness, et cetera.

1:19:59.780 --> 1:20:01.740
 An important feature of this podcast, as you know,

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:03.300
 is that we dive deep into topics

1:20:03.300 --> 1:20:05.440
 for several episodes at a time,

1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:07.320
 at least a month at a time.

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.140
 So by stopping here,

1:20:09.140 --> 1:20:12.540
 I recognize that there are probably many more questions

1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:13.780
 that you still have.

1:20:13.780 --> 1:20:15.480
 And the great thing about that

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:18.040
 is that we have another episode coming up soon.

1:20:18.040 --> 1:20:19.980
 I'm going to hold office hours

1:20:19.980 --> 1:20:22.320
 where I'm going to answer your specific questions

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:24.500
 about episodes one and two.

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:26.800
 So if you have questions about this episode,

1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:28.280
 you have questions about episode one,

1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:30.940
 write them down, put them in the comments.

1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:32.460
 I'll also do a post on Instagram

1:20:32.460 --> 1:20:34.540
 where you can put them in the comments there,

1:20:34.540 --> 1:20:37.340
 but put them in the comments to this episode.

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:41.940
 As well, please recommend the podcast if you like it.

1:20:41.940 --> 1:20:44.300
 Please subscribe to it here on YouTube.

1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:46.420
 Please subscribe to it on Apple.

1:20:46.420 --> 1:20:48.320
 We're now on Spotify as well.

1:20:48.320 --> 1:20:49.860
 Recommend it to a friend.

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:52.040
 The community that we're creating here

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:54.100
 around these topics of sleep and wakefulness

1:20:54.100 --> 1:20:56.500
 and other neuroscience and health-related themes

1:20:56.500 --> 1:21:00.020
 is best supported by your involvement and your questions.

1:21:00.020 --> 1:21:02.140
 And so I'm going to be reading all of your questions,

1:21:02.140 --> 1:21:05.580
 distilling those into the most commonly asked questions

1:21:05.580 --> 1:21:06.780
 and liked questions.

1:21:06.780 --> 1:21:07.840
 So if you see something below

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:09.740
 that you are particularly interested in,

1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:11.140
 you don't have to put that question in again,

1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:13.780
 you can just give it a like, the little thumbs up tab.

1:21:13.780 --> 1:21:17.780
 And if you're listening to this on Spotify or Apple,

1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:19.300
 please go to YouTube,

1:21:19.300 --> 1:21:20.940
 subscribe and put your question there,

1:21:20.940 --> 1:21:23.040
 or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram,

1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:24.620
 and you can put your questions there

1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:27.060
 so that next episode I can answer those questions

1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:29.480
 and then we can move forward even more deeply

1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:32.640
 into these critical topics around sleep and wakefulness

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:34.820
 so that you can be armed with all the information

1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:36.220
 and resources that you need.

1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:38.180
 Last but not least,

1:21:38.180 --> 1:21:40.020
 a number of you have very graciously asked

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:42.080
 how you can support the podcast.

1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:43.540
 The best way to support the podcast

1:21:43.540 --> 1:21:46.820
 is to subscribe on YouTube or one of the other platforms.

1:21:46.820 --> 1:21:49.820
 We're now on Spotify and Apple.

1:21:49.820 --> 1:21:51.940
 And the other way you can really support the podcast

1:21:51.940 --> 1:21:53.520
 is to check out our sponsors,

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.220
 which were discussed at the beginning.

1:21:55.220 --> 1:21:57.180
 So thank you so much for your time and attention,

1:21:57.180 --> 1:21:59.740
 and above all, thank you for your interest in science.

1:21:59.740 --> 1:22:21.740
 And I'll see you in the next one.
