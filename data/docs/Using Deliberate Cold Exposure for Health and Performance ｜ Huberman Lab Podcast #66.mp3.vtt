00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.260
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.260 --> 00:12.980
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.980 --> 00:14.940
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.380
 Today, we are going to discuss

00:16.380 --> 00:18.460
 the use of deliberate cold exposure

00:18.460 --> 00:20.500
 for health and performance.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.660
 Temperature is a powerful stimulus on our nervous system

00:23.660 --> 00:26.780
 and indeed on every organ and system of our body.

00:26.780 --> 00:30.060
 And cold in particular can be leveraged to improve

00:30.060 --> 00:33.200
 mental health, physical health, and performance,

00:33.200 --> 00:35.300
 meaning for endurance exercise,

00:35.300 --> 00:38.180
 for recovering from various forms of exercise,

00:38.180 --> 00:41.460
 for actually improving strength and power,

00:41.460 --> 00:43.900
 and for enhancing mental capacity.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.920
 In order to properly leverage deliberate cold exposure

00:46.920 --> 00:50.260
 for sake of mental health, physical health, and performance,

00:50.260 --> 00:53.220
 you have to understand how cold impacts the brain and body.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.300
 So today we are going to discuss that.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.040
 We're going to talk about some of the neural circuits

00:57.040 --> 00:59.600
 and pathways, some of the hormones involved.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.020
 I promise to make it all clear and accessible,

01:02.020 --> 01:03.140
 regardless of whether or not

01:03.140 --> 01:05.500
 you have a scientific background or not.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.040
 We are also going to discuss very specific protocols

01:08.040 --> 01:10.440
 that you can apply, which leverage variables

01:10.440 --> 01:14.020
 like temperature, how cold, how to deliver the cold,

01:14.020 --> 01:16.120
 for instance, whether or not you use a cold shower,

01:16.120 --> 01:20.940
 cold immersion, ice bath, circulating water, or still water,

01:20.940 --> 01:23.860
 whether or not you're going for walks outside in a t-shirt

01:23.860 --> 01:25.460
 when it's cold, or whether or not

01:25.460 --> 01:28.100
 you're purposefully using things like cryo,

01:28.100 --> 01:30.340
 if you have access to that or not.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.660
 One thing I can promise you is that

01:31.660 --> 01:33.520
 by the end of today's episode,

01:33.520 --> 01:36.580
 you will know a lot about the biology of thermal regulation.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.960
 That is how your brain and body regulates its temperature.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.340
 You will also have a lot of tools in your arsenal

01:42.340 --> 01:44.460
 that you can use and leverage toward

01:44.460 --> 01:46.620
 improving mental health, physical health,

01:46.620 --> 01:48.280
 reducing inflammation in the body,

01:48.280 --> 01:50.180
 improving athletic performance,

01:50.180 --> 01:51.820
 improving mental performance.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.540
 I promise to spell out all those protocols in detail

01:54.540 --> 01:57.480
 as I go along and to summarize them again at the end.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.700
 I'd like to make a point now that I'm going to make

01:59.700 --> 02:02.500
 several additional times during today's episode,

02:02.500 --> 02:06.080
 and that is that temperature is a very potent stimulus

02:06.080 --> 02:07.700
 for the brain and body.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.360
 That also means that it carries certain hazards

02:10.360 --> 02:12.100
 if it's not done correctly.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.340
 Now, everyone shows up to the table, meaning to protocols,

02:15.340 --> 02:17.380
 with a different background of health status,

02:17.380 --> 02:19.140
 and there's simply no way that I can know

02:19.140 --> 02:20.740
 what your health status is.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.260
 So anytime you are going to take on a new protocol,

02:23.260 --> 02:26.680
 that means a behavioral protocol or a nutritional protocol

02:26.680 --> 02:28.460
 or a supplementation protocol,

02:28.460 --> 02:31.580
 you should absolutely consult a board-certified physician

02:31.580 --> 02:34.060
 before initiating that protocol.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.340
 I don't just say this to protect us.

02:35.340 --> 02:37.660
 I also say this to protect you.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.460
 If you'd like to see our medical disclaimer,

02:39.460 --> 02:40.840
 you can go to our show notes.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.680
 It's described there.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.900
 In fact, I encourage you to please do that.

02:43.900 --> 02:47.780
 And in general, when embarking on new protocols,

02:47.780 --> 02:50.220
 in particular, if they involve strong stimuli

02:50.220 --> 02:51.380
 like changing temperature

02:51.380 --> 02:54.680
 or placing yourself into unusual temperatures,

02:54.680 --> 02:56.880
 I would encourage you to progress gradually.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.620
 I would also encourage you to not look at gradual progression

03:00.620 --> 03:03.040
 as the kind of weak version of a protocol.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.580
 In fact, today I'm going to discuss

03:04.580 --> 03:06.900
 a really beautiful peer-reviewed study

03:06.900 --> 03:10.380
 that involved having people do deliberate cold exposure,

03:10.380 --> 03:12.460
 so they were immersing themselves into water

03:12.460 --> 03:13.660
 up to about their neck,

03:13.660 --> 03:15.740
 and the water was actually not that cold.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.540
 It was only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit,

03:17.540 --> 03:19.420
 which for most people is pretty tolerable,

03:19.420 --> 03:22.060
 so nowhere near the kinds of extreme temperatures

03:22.060 --> 03:25.280
 that one could use in other protocols.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.560
 And the interesting thing is,

03:26.560 --> 03:29.960
 despite that fairly modest cold temperature,

03:29.960 --> 03:31.880
 by simply extending the duration of time

03:31.880 --> 03:33.380
 that people were in that water,

03:33.380 --> 03:36.500
 they experienced enormous increases in neurochemicals

03:36.500 --> 03:40.500
 that ought to translate to improvements in focus and mood,

03:40.500 --> 03:42.620
 and indeed, that's what's been observed

03:42.620 --> 03:44.540
 in subsequent studies.

03:44.540 --> 03:47.760
 So again, please see our medical disclaimer in our show notes

03:47.760 --> 03:50.740
 please proceed with caution always.

03:50.740 --> 03:54.600
 Please also understand that the most potent stimulus

03:54.600 --> 03:56.500
 isn't always the one that you experience

03:56.500 --> 03:58.220
 as the most intense in the moment.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.460
 In fact, I would encourage you

03:59.460 --> 04:02.420
 to find the minimum threshold of stimulus

04:02.420 --> 04:05.140
 that will allow you to derive the maximum benefit

04:05.140 --> 04:06.980
 from each protocol, and indeed,

04:06.980 --> 04:10.540
 I will point out what those thresholds ought to be today.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.420
 I'll give you some simple formulas,

04:12.420 --> 04:14.340
 gauges or guides that you can use

04:14.340 --> 04:16.900
 in order to navigate this extremely interesting

04:16.900 --> 04:20.500
 and potent tool that we call deliberate cold exposure.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.340
 Before we talk about deliberate cold exposure

04:22.340 --> 04:24.860
 and its many powerful applications,

04:24.860 --> 04:26.180
 I'd like to highlight a study

04:26.180 --> 04:27.800
 that I find particularly interesting

04:27.800 --> 04:29.340
 and that I think you will find

04:29.340 --> 04:31.900
 particularly interesting and useful.

04:31.900 --> 04:35.300
 The title of this study is brief aerobic exercise

04:35.300 --> 04:37.820
 immediately enhances visual attentional control

04:37.820 --> 04:39.460
 and perceptual speed,

04:39.460 --> 04:43.440
 testing the mediating role of feelings of energy.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.740
 Now, the reason I like this study is,

04:45.740 --> 04:48.940
 first of all, it's a fairly large size sample group.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.300
 They looked at 101 students.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.740
 These were college age students, and they had two groups.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.740
 One group did 15 minutes of jogging at moderate intensity.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.560
 So when they did measure percent heart rates, et cetera,

05:04.560 --> 05:08.420
 but this would be analogous to zone two cardio,

05:08.420 --> 05:10.380
 which I've discussed on this podcast before.

05:10.380 --> 05:14.240
 Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise

05:14.240 --> 05:15.700
 that places you at a level

05:15.700 --> 05:18.220
 where you can hold a conversation

05:18.220 --> 05:20.060
 with a little bit of strain,

05:20.060 --> 05:21.440
 meaning that you can get the words out,

05:21.440 --> 05:23.400
 but every once in a while, you have to catch your breath.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.100
 Whereas if you were to push any harder

05:26.100 --> 05:27.860
 by any mechanism going faster

05:27.860 --> 05:30.020
 or on a steeper incline, et cetera,

05:30.020 --> 05:31.460
 that you would have a hard time

05:31.460 --> 05:32.820
 carrying out a conversation.

05:32.820 --> 05:37.140
 So zone two cardio is a common form

05:37.140 --> 05:38.940
 of describing that level of intensity

05:38.940 --> 05:40.620
 that they call moderate intensity.

05:40.620 --> 05:43.180
 So one group did 15 minutes of jogging

05:43.180 --> 05:44.300
 at moderate intensity,

05:44.300 --> 05:47.780
 which I'm translating to roughly zone two cardio.

05:47.780 --> 05:52.000
 The other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentration

05:52.000 --> 05:55.380
 that is somewhat akin to mindfulness meditation.

05:55.380 --> 05:58.960
 And then they were analyzed for perceptual speed,

05:58.960 --> 06:00.260
 visual attentional control,

06:00.260 --> 06:01.700
 something called working memory,

06:01.700 --> 06:04.420
 which is your ability to keep certain batches

06:04.420 --> 06:06.460
 of information online.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.900
 Just imagine someone telling you their phone number

06:08.900 --> 06:10.760
 and you have to remember that sequence of numbers

06:10.760 --> 06:12.900
 in your head for some period of time.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.940
 And that's working memory.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.300
 And it depends very heavily

06:15.300 --> 06:17.960
 on the so-called prefrontal cortical networks,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
 which are involved in planning and action.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.100
 And they also looked at people's feelings of energy

06:23.100 --> 06:24.420
 and they measured that subjectively,

06:24.420 --> 06:26.060
 how energetic people felt.

06:26.060 --> 06:27.980
 Now, the major takeaways from the study

06:27.980 --> 06:29.020
 that I'd like to emphasize

06:29.020 --> 06:32.600
 are that the 15 minutes of jogging group

06:32.600 --> 06:35.280
 experienced elevated levels of energy

06:35.280 --> 06:38.900
 for some period of time after they ceased the exercise.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.780
 Whereas the group that did mindfulness meditation

06:41.780 --> 06:44.140
 actually reported feeling more calm

06:44.140 --> 06:46.740
 and having less overall energy.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.860
 Now that's very subjective

06:47.860 --> 06:52.040
 and indeed they used subjective measures to analyze energy.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.020
 But what gets interesting is when they looked at performance

06:55.020 --> 06:57.340
 on these various cognitive tasks

06:57.340 --> 06:59.260
 and the two tasks that they use

06:59.260 --> 07:01.340
 were called the trail making tests.

07:01.340 --> 07:02.660
 They have different versions of this,

07:02.660 --> 07:03.820
 version A, version B,

07:03.820 --> 07:05.700
 I don't want to go into too much detail,

07:05.700 --> 07:09.920
 but version A essentially involves having a page of numbers

07:09.920 --> 07:11.860
 that are distributed somewhat randomly.

07:11.860 --> 07:13.180
 So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

07:13.180 --> 07:15.900
 and so on, but distributed randomly across the page.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.540
 And people have to use visual search

07:17.540 --> 07:19.480
 to circle those numbers in sequence.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.100
 So this involves visual attention,

07:21.100 --> 07:23.500
 it involves some motor skills,

07:23.500 --> 07:24.380
 involves a number of things

07:24.380 --> 07:27.180
 that certainly require energy and focus.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.300
 The second test was the trail making test part B,

07:30.300 --> 07:31.220
 as I mentioned earlier,

07:31.220 --> 07:33.980
 and this involved also circling numbers in sequence,

07:33.980 --> 07:36.480
 but interspersed between those numbers were letters.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.260
 So rather than just having to circle off numbers

07:39.260 --> 07:41.580
 in sequence, they actually had to connect one,

07:41.580 --> 07:44.380
 then the letter A, then two, then the letter B, et cetera.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.420
 And remember, these are randomly distributed across a page.

07:47.420 --> 07:48.820
 The major takeaway from the study

07:48.820 --> 07:51.740
 is that the group that did the 15 minutes

07:51.740 --> 07:55.220
 of moderate exercise prior to these two tests

07:55.220 --> 07:57.900
 showed significant decreases in the amount of time

07:57.900 --> 08:01.340
 required to complete these tests accurately.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.300
 That is interesting and indeed surprising, at least to me,

08:05.300 --> 08:07.300
 because there have been many studies

08:07.300 --> 08:09.200
 looking at the effects of mindfulness meditation

08:09.200 --> 08:11.160
 on the ability to focus.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.980
 The key variable in the study turned out to be energy,

08:13.980 --> 08:17.540
 this feeling, subjectively measured feeling, I should say,

08:17.540 --> 08:20.820
 of having more energy and thereby the ability to focus,

08:20.820 --> 08:23.740
 especially in these high cognitive demand tasks.

08:23.740 --> 08:25.420
 Now, the takeaway from this study for all of us,

08:25.420 --> 08:27.300
 I think is pretty straightforward.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.140
 If you are going to sit down to do some work

08:30.140 --> 08:32.540
 that requires focus and working memory

08:32.540 --> 08:33.580
 and cognitive attention,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.800
 and especially if it's some visual spatial control,

08:36.800 --> 08:38.420
 meaning you have to search for things on a page,

08:38.420 --> 08:39.820
 you have to organize things on a page,

08:39.820 --> 08:41.420
 so this would be writing, arithmetic,

08:41.420 --> 08:44.620
 basically cognitive work of any kind,

08:44.620 --> 08:49.540
 15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior to that work bout

08:49.540 --> 08:51.540
 could be very beneficial for you.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.900
 This does not mean that mindfulness meditation

08:53.900 --> 08:55.380
 would not be of benefit to you.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.200
 I wouldn't want you to conclude that,

08:57.200 --> 08:58.900
 but if you had to choose between doing

08:58.900 --> 09:00.860
 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation

09:00.860 --> 09:02.820
 and doing 15 minutes of moderate exercise

09:02.820 --> 09:05.660
 prior to a cognitive work bout,

09:05.660 --> 09:08.500
 I would say the 15 minutes of moderate exercise

09:08.500 --> 09:09.940
 would be more valuable,

09:09.940 --> 09:12.220
 at least based on the data in this paper.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.360
 In many previous podcasts,

09:14.360 --> 09:18.500
 I've talked about the powerful effects of doing things like

09:18.500 --> 09:21.860
 mindfulness meditation and other forms of NSDR,

09:21.860 --> 09:24.460
 non-sleep deep rest, so these could be 20 minute naps

09:24.460 --> 09:26.660
 or just lying there quietly with your eyes closed

09:26.660 --> 09:31.460
 or yoga nidra or NSDR scripts are available on YouTube

09:31.460 --> 09:34.620
 and various other places free of cost of any kind.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.460
 You can just go to YouTube, put in NSDR,

09:36.460 --> 09:37.640
 non-sleep deep rest.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.500
 Those protocols have been shown to be very beneficial

09:41.500 --> 09:43.860
 for enhancing neuroplasticity,

09:43.860 --> 09:47.080
 the changes in the brain and body that encode

09:47.080 --> 09:51.660
 or shift the neural circuits that allow for memory to change

09:51.660 --> 09:55.720
 that allow for learning to occur after a learning bout.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.460
 What I'm referring to today in this particular study

09:58.460 --> 10:00.780
 is the use of moderate exercise

10:00.780 --> 10:03.920
 in order to increase one's focus and attention

10:03.920 --> 10:06.760
 in order to trigger that neuroplasticity.

10:06.760 --> 10:11.200
 So the simple sequence here is get energetic and alert,

10:12.080 --> 10:14.180
 do that prior to the learning bout,

10:14.180 --> 10:16.340
 engage in the cognitive work or learning bout,

10:16.340 --> 10:19.420
 and then mindfulness meditation, NSDR and so forth

10:19.420 --> 10:20.660
 should follow.

10:20.660 --> 10:23.140
 And if you would like to access this paper

10:23.140 --> 10:25.540
 and like to look more at the details in the paper,

10:25.540 --> 10:27.260
 we'll be sure to put a link in the show notes.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.180
 The first author is Legrand.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.580
 And again, the title of this paper is

10:30.580 --> 10:32.620
 "'Brief Aerobic Exercise Immediately Enhances

10:32.620 --> 10:34.980
 Visual Attention Control and Perceptual Speed,

10:34.980 --> 10:37.500
 Testing the Mediating Role of Feelings of Energy.'"

10:37.500 --> 10:40.100
 And I also just want to emphasize immediately,

10:40.100 --> 10:42.140
 I think most people out there are interested in tools

10:42.140 --> 10:43.900
 and protocols that work the first time

10:43.900 --> 10:44.980
 and that work every time.

10:44.980 --> 10:47.760
 And indeed, I think this protocol fits that bill.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.260
 I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting

10:49.260 --> 10:51.420
 two live events this May.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.940
 The first live event will be hosted

10:52.940 --> 10:55.620
 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.240
 The second live event will be hosted

10:57.240 --> 10:59.620
 in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.560
 Both are part of a lecture series entitled

11:01.560 --> 11:03.180
 The Brain-Body Contract,

11:03.180 --> 11:04.900
 during which I will discuss science

11:04.900 --> 11:07.080
 and science-based tools for mental health,

11:07.080 --> 11:08.860
 physical health, and performance.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.300
 And I should point out that while some of the material

11:11.300 --> 11:13.960
 I'll cover will overlap with information covered here

11:13.960 --> 11:15.580
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast

11:15.580 --> 11:17.420
 and on various social media posts,

11:17.420 --> 11:19.100
 most of the information I will cover

11:19.100 --> 11:21.620
 is going to be distinct from information covered

11:21.620 --> 11:23.460
 on the podcast or elsewhere.

11:23.460 --> 11:26.000
 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.340
 Portland on May 18th.

11:27.340 --> 11:31.460
 You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com slash tour

11:31.460 --> 11:32.900
 and I hope to see you there.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.580
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

11:34.580 --> 11:36.520
 that this podcast is separate from my teaching

11:36.520 --> 11:38.280
 and research roles at Stanford.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.380
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

11:40.380 --> 11:43.100
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

11:43.100 --> 11:45.780
 and science-related tools to the general public.

11:45.780 --> 11:46.940
 In keeping with that theme,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.700
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

11:49.700 --> 11:53.620
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, also called AG1.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.540
 I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,

11:56.540 --> 11:58.980
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.660
 The reason I started taking AG1

12:00.660 --> 12:03.700
 and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day

12:03.700 --> 12:06.380
 is that it covers my foundational vitamin, mineral,

12:06.380 --> 12:07.820
 and probiotic needs.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.260
 It also has adaptogens and things like zinc

12:10.260 --> 12:11.980
 for immune system function,

12:11.980 --> 12:14.740
 but the probiotics are one of the key features in there.

12:14.740 --> 12:17.060
 I've done several podcasts on the gut microbiome,

12:17.060 --> 12:18.900
 which are these trillions of microbiota

12:18.900 --> 12:20.340
 that live in our digestive tract

12:20.340 --> 12:22.360
 and that are crucial for our immune system,

12:22.360 --> 12:23.760
 brain function, and so on.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.940
 One way to enhance our gut microbiome

12:26.940 --> 12:28.180
 to ensure that it's healthy

12:28.180 --> 12:31.100
 is to make sure that we get the correct probiotics.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.600
 And Athletic Greens has the correct prebiotics

12:33.600 --> 12:36.920
 and probiotics that ensure a healthy gut microbiome.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.360
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

12:38.360 --> 12:41.180
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

12:41.180 --> 12:42.500
 to claim a special offer.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.020
 They'll give you five free travel packs

12:44.020 --> 12:46.060
 that make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

12:46.060 --> 12:48.460
 while you're on the road, so in the car and on the plane.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.380
 I should mention that Athletic Greens is delicious.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.200
 I love the way it tastes.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.260
 I mix mine with some water

12:52.260 --> 12:53.780
 and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

12:53.780 --> 12:55.980
 The special offer is the five free travel packs

12:55.980 --> 12:58.900
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.900
 Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important

13:00.900 --> 13:03.400
 for a tremendous number of biological functions.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.780
 Many of us who get sunlight get enough vitamin D3.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.880
 Many of us, even if we do get sunlight,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.820
 do not get enough vitamin D3.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.820
 So the year supply of vitamin D3 also has K2,

13:13.820 --> 13:15.700
 which is important for cardiovascular function,

13:15.700 --> 13:17.360
 for calcium regulation.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.020
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

13:20.020 --> 13:21.380
 to get the five free travel packs

13:21.380 --> 13:24.020
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.360
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.480
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

13:28.480 --> 13:30.500
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.340
 The company was founded

13:31.340 --> 13:33.200
 by two all-American swimmers from Stanford

13:33.200 --> 13:35.940
 and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses

13:35.940 --> 13:38.560
 were designed with performance in mind.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.100
 Now, the glasses were initially designed

13:40.100 --> 13:41.140
 for athletic performance,

13:41.140 --> 13:42.540
 meaning they were designed to be worn

13:42.540 --> 13:43.940
 while cycling or running,

13:43.940 --> 13:46.140
 and indeed you can wear them while cycling or running.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.840
 If you get sweaty, they won't slip off your face.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.660
 They're very lightweight.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.140
 In fact, you hardly ever remember

13:50.140 --> 13:50.980
 that they're on your face.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.840
 At least I can't remember that they're on my face.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.700
 I wear the sunglasses when I drive.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.140
 I wear readers at night,

13:56.140 --> 13:58.220
 but they're not just for athletic performance.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.660
 They have a terrific aesthetic,

13:59.660 --> 14:02.340
 so you could wear them to the office or to work or to school.

14:02.340 --> 14:03.180
 They look great.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.940
 Unlike a lot of high-performance sunglasses out there

14:04.940 --> 14:06.160
 that make people look like cyborgs,

14:06.160 --> 14:08.180
 these you would be happy to wear anywhere.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.700
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

14:09.700 --> 14:12.920
 you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A dot com,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.420
 and enter the code Huberman

14:14.420 --> 14:16.740
 to save 20% off your first order.

14:16.740 --> 14:19.220
 Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,

14:19.220 --> 14:21.220
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

14:21.220 --> 14:24.020
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.140
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

14:26.140 --> 14:29.060
 that are uniquely designed to your sleep needs.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.720
 Everybody knows the importance of sleep

14:30.720 --> 14:33.140
 for mental health, physical health, and performance,

14:33.140 --> 14:35.240
 but probably what everyone doesn't realize

14:35.240 --> 14:37.620
 is that you have unique sleep needs.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.100
 Your body, and indeed the way you sleep,

14:40.100 --> 14:41.680
 need to be matched to the correct mattress

14:41.680 --> 14:43.740
 in order to get the best possible sleep.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.680
 Helix understands that, and if you go to their website,

14:46.680 --> 14:49.220
 they have a brief two-minute quiz that anyone can take

14:49.220 --> 14:51.540
 that will match your body type and sleep preferences

14:51.540 --> 14:53.420
 to the perfect mattress for you.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.260
 So they ask questions like, do you sleep on your side,

14:55.260 --> 14:56.860
 your back, or your stomach, or maybe you don't know,

14:56.860 --> 14:58.380
 do you tend to run hot or cold through the night,

14:58.380 --> 14:59.620
 or maybe you don't know.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.140
 I matched to the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,

15:02.140 --> 15:04.220
 because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm

15:04.220 --> 15:06.100
 nor too soft, and I've been sleeping on that mattress

15:06.100 --> 15:09.020
 for over a year now, it's the best sleep I've ever had.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.740
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

15:10.740 --> 15:13.260
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

15:13.260 --> 15:14.740
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

15:14.740 --> 15:16.740
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress,

15:16.740 --> 15:19.660
 and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order

15:19.660 --> 15:20.940
 and two free pillows.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.180
 They have a 10-year warranty,

15:22.180 --> 15:24.120
 and you get to try the mattress out

15:24.120 --> 15:26.020
 for 100 nights risk-free.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.580
 They'll even pick it up for you if you don't like it,

15:27.580 --> 15:28.940
 although I think you will like it.

15:28.940 --> 15:30.140
 I certainly love mine.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.180
 Again, if you're interested,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.420
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

15:33.420 --> 15:35.880
 to get up to $200 off your mattress order

15:35.880 --> 15:37.260
 and two free pillows.

15:37.260 --> 15:38.860
 Okay, let's talk about the use of cold

15:38.860 --> 15:40.540
 for health and performance.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.580
 I confess I love this topic because it takes me back

15:43.580 --> 15:47.380
 to my undergraduate years when I worked in a laboratory

15:47.380 --> 15:49.540
 studying cold physiology,

15:49.540 --> 15:52.620
 its effects on the brain and its effects on the body.

15:52.620 --> 15:53.980
 And over the years,

15:53.980 --> 15:56.740
 I've always kept track of the literature in this area,

15:56.740 --> 15:59.780
 and indeed there have been some tremendous discoveries,

15:59.780 --> 16:02.780
 both in animal models, so in rodents like mice and rats,

16:02.780 --> 16:04.540
 but also in humans.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.080
 And today we're going to talk about

16:06.080 --> 16:07.740
 both categories of studies,

16:07.740 --> 16:09.460
 and I will be careful to point out

16:09.460 --> 16:11.860
 when discoveries were made in animal models

16:11.860 --> 16:14.140
 and when they were made in humans.

16:15.060 --> 16:19.740
 A key point when thinking about the use of cold as a tool,

16:19.740 --> 16:23.740
 and the key point is that you have a baseline level

16:23.740 --> 16:26.480
 of temperature that is varying,

16:26.480 --> 16:29.440
 changing across the 24-hour cycle.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.220
 So any use of deliberate cold exposure

16:32.220 --> 16:36.120
 is going to be superimposed on that rhythm,

16:36.120 --> 16:39.540
 that circadian rhythm, meaning that 24-hour rhythm.

16:39.540 --> 16:44.540
 The basic contour of your circadian rhythm in temperature

16:44.700 --> 16:49.520
 is that approximately two hours before the time you wake up

16:49.520 --> 16:51.880
 is your so-called temperature minimum.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.360
 So your temperature minimum is a time

16:54.360 --> 16:56.140
 within the 24-hour cycle

16:56.140 --> 16:59.860
 when your body temperature is at its lowest, okay?

16:59.860 --> 17:03.200
 So if you normally wake up around 6 a.m.,

17:03.200 --> 17:07.340
 your temperature minimum is probably about 4 a.m.

17:07.340 --> 17:09.960
 If you normally wake up at about 7 a.m.,

17:09.960 --> 17:13.140
 your temperature minimum is probably about 5 a.m.

17:13.140 --> 17:16.180
 It's not exactly two hours before your wake-up time.

17:16.180 --> 17:19.220
 It's approximately two hours before your wake-up time.

17:19.220 --> 17:22.660
 Now, as you go from your temperature minimum

17:22.660 --> 17:25.060
 to the time in which you are going to awake,

17:25.060 --> 17:27.940
 your temperature is rising slightly.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.380
 And then at the point where you wake up,

17:30.380 --> 17:33.300
 your temperature starts to go up more sharply

17:33.300 --> 17:35.820
 and will continue to go up into the early

17:35.820 --> 17:38.580
 and sometimes even into the late afternoon.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.340
 And then sometime in the late afternoon and evening,

17:41.340 --> 17:44.740
 your temperature will start to decline.

17:44.740 --> 17:46.720
 And indeed, as you approach sleep,

17:46.720 --> 17:48.220
 your body temperature will drop

17:48.220 --> 17:50.760
 by anywhere from one to three degrees.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.980
 And in fact, that decrease in core body temperature

17:53.980 --> 17:55.700
 is important, if not essential,

17:55.700 --> 17:58.980
 for getting into and staying in deep sleep, okay?

17:58.980 --> 18:01.580
 So temperature rises with waking.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.820
 That's easy to remember.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.580
 It tends to continue to rise throughout the day.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.300
 And in the late afternoon and evening,

18:07.300 --> 18:09.540
 your temperature will start to go down

18:09.540 --> 18:13.860
 and the drop in temperature actually helps you access sleep.

18:13.860 --> 18:18.260
 That background, or what we call baseline circadian rhythm

18:18.260 --> 18:21.160
 in core body temperature is important to remember

18:21.160 --> 18:24.300
 because it helps us frame both the effects

18:24.300 --> 18:26.380
 of deliberate cold exposure

18:26.380 --> 18:29.660
 and it helps us frame when you might want

18:29.660 --> 18:31.100
 to use deliberate cold exposure

18:31.100 --> 18:33.580
 in order to access specific states.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.740
 It also points to times within the 24-hour cycle

18:36.740 --> 18:39.820
 when you might want to avoid using deliberate cold exposure

18:39.820 --> 18:42.520
 if your primary goal is to get to sleep.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.580
 Okay, so that's the circadian rhythm in temperature.

18:45.580 --> 18:48.800
 Now I just briefly want to touch on thermal regulation

18:48.800 --> 18:51.080
 at the level of the body and the brain.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.180
 And this will be very surprising to many of you.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.500
 Let's do what's called a Gedanken experiment,

18:57.500 --> 18:58.940
 which is a thought experiment.

18:58.940 --> 19:01.940
 Let's say I send you out into the desert heat

19:01.940 --> 19:05.220
 for a jog or a run, and it's very hot outside,

19:05.220 --> 19:08.680
 you know, 102 degrees or 103 degrees.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.220
 And you start to move, you start to sweat,

19:12.220 --> 19:14.860
 and of course your core body temperature goes up.

19:14.860 --> 19:18.840
 Now, then I offer you a cold towel,

19:18.840 --> 19:21.180
 maybe a really, really cold towel.

19:21.180 --> 19:22.820
 And this towel is saturated with water

19:22.820 --> 19:24.700
 so you could actually squeeze the water out of that

19:24.700 --> 19:26.320
 and cool your body off.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.760
 And our Gedanken experiment is for me to say,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.460
 okay, where are you going to place the towel?

19:31.460 --> 19:33.780
 How are you going to cool yourself off?

19:33.780 --> 19:35.860
 And I'm guessing that most of you would think

19:35.860 --> 19:37.560
 that the best way to cool yourself off

19:37.560 --> 19:39.500
 would be to drape that towel over your head,

19:39.500 --> 19:41.980
 maybe your neck, over your torso,

19:41.980 --> 19:43.280
 that it would feel really, really good

19:43.280 --> 19:45.340
 and they would cool you off.

19:45.340 --> 19:48.220
 Well, that's exactly the wrong approach

19:48.220 --> 19:49.300
 if you want to cool off.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.060
 And in fact, if you were to use that approach,

19:52.060 --> 19:56.580
 your body temperature would continue to increase even more,

19:56.580 --> 20:00.300
 yes, even more than had you not placed that cold towel

20:00.300 --> 20:02.540
 on your head or your torso.

20:02.540 --> 20:04.460
 And here is why.

20:04.460 --> 20:07.380
 Thermal regulation, meaning your brain and body's ability

20:07.380 --> 20:10.900
 to regulate your internal core temperature

20:10.900 --> 20:12.500
 is somewhat like a thermostat

20:12.500 --> 20:15.140
 and that thermostat resides in your brain.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.620
 So if you think about the thermostat

20:16.620 --> 20:18.640
 in your home or apartment,

20:18.640 --> 20:21.380
 if it's too warm in your home or apartment

20:22.540 --> 20:24.940
 and you were to take a bag of ice

20:24.940 --> 20:27.600
 and to put it on that thermostat,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.060
 what would the thermostat do?

20:29.060 --> 20:32.620
 It would register the environment as artificially cool.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.640
 It would think that the environment

20:34.640 --> 20:37.940
 was actually much colder than it is.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.740
 And so as a consequence,

20:39.740 --> 20:41.000
 it would trigger a mechanism

20:41.000 --> 20:43.500
 to further increase the temperature in the room.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
 And you have such a thermostat as well.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.500
 It's called the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.140
 The hypothalamus is a small region of brain tissue

20:52.140 --> 20:54.060
 about over the roof of your mouth

20:54.060 --> 20:56.180
 and a little bit in front of that.

20:56.180 --> 20:59.500
 So it's basically right behind your nose

20:59.500 --> 21:01.200
 and over the roof of your mouth.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.620
 And it's a collection of neurons.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.500
 Those neurons have a lot of different functions

21:04.500 --> 21:07.500
 that include things like the control of aggression,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.200
 the control of sex behavior,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.680
 the control of temperature regulation and so on.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.960
 The medial preoptic area has connections

21:14.960 --> 21:17.240
 with the rest of the brain

21:17.240 --> 21:19.060
 or areas within the brain, I should say,

21:19.060 --> 21:21.460
 and with many areas within the body.

21:21.460 --> 21:26.100
 It receives input from receptors in our skin

21:26.100 --> 21:29.560
 and inside our body that register temperature,

21:29.560 --> 21:31.280
 and it acts as a thermostat.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.540
 So if the surface of your body is made cool,

21:34.540 --> 21:38.380
 your medial preoptic area will send signals

21:38.380 --> 21:41.700
 by way of hormones and by way of chemicals

21:41.700 --> 21:44.620
 that will serve to heat your body up.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.220
 So what this means is that if you want to cool down,

21:47.220 --> 21:48.980
 the last thing you want to do

21:48.980 --> 21:52.780
 is to bring a cold surface of any kind,

21:52.780 --> 21:54.560
 towel or splashing water,

21:54.560 --> 21:57.180
 to the majority of your body surface.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.080
 It might be very, very surprising to you.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.900
 And you might say, wait, if I want to cool down,

22:00.900 --> 22:02.940
 I should jump into a cold lake or something of that sort.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.500
 That's a different thing altogether.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.500
 What I'll tell you,

22:06.500 --> 22:08.260
 and we'll get into this in more depth later,

22:08.260 --> 22:09.920
 is that if you really want to cool down

22:09.920 --> 22:11.340
 quickly and efficiently,

22:11.340 --> 22:14.780
 you should leverage particular portals,

22:14.780 --> 22:18.160
 meaning particular sites on your body

22:18.160 --> 22:21.660
 where heat can leave your body more readily

22:21.660 --> 22:26.100
 and where cooling can have a dramatic and fast impact

22:26.100 --> 22:27.160
 on your core body temperature.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.400
 It can even save your life if you're going hyperthermic.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.940
 We're going to talk more about the specific protocols

22:31.940 --> 22:34.620
 to reduce core body temperature for sake of performance

22:34.620 --> 22:37.500
 and avoiding hyperthermia later in the episode.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.580
 Hyperthermia, of course, is a very, very dangerous situation

22:40.580 --> 22:43.260
 because while your body can drop in core temperature

22:44.160 --> 22:45.820
 somewhat and still be safe,

22:45.820 --> 22:48.460
 you can't really increase your body temperature that much

22:48.460 --> 22:50.020
 before your brain starts to cook

22:50.020 --> 22:52.040
 and other organs start to cook and by cook,

22:52.040 --> 22:54.140
 I mean the cells actually start to die.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.900
 So you have to be very, very careful with the use of heat.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.420
 Heat stroke is no joke.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.260
 People die from heat stroke all the time.

23:00.260 --> 23:02.340
 You really want to avoid that.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.740
 One way to avoid that

23:04.700 --> 23:07.540
 is to cool the appropriate surfaces of your body

23:07.540 --> 23:10.000
 and the appropriate surfaces in this case

23:10.000 --> 23:11.860
 are the upper cheeks,

23:11.860 --> 23:14.520
 or I would say the upper half of the face,

23:14.520 --> 23:16.480
 the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.560
 I've talked about this on the podcast before

23:18.560 --> 23:20.900
 and in the guest episode with Dr. Craig Heller,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.860
 my colleague in the biology department at Stanford,

23:23.860 --> 23:26.460
 but just very briefly, these surfaces,

23:26.460 --> 23:28.340
 the upper half of the face,

23:28.340 --> 23:31.100
 the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet

23:31.100 --> 23:34.940
 are what we call glabrous skin surfaces,

23:34.940 --> 23:38.340
 G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous.

23:38.340 --> 23:42.660
 And those surfaces are unique in that just below them,

23:42.660 --> 23:46.100
 the vasculature is different than elsewhere in the body.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.860
 Normally, the passage of blood goes from arteries

23:48.860 --> 23:50.640
 to capillaries to veins,

23:50.640 --> 23:53.900
 but just beneath the glabrous skin

23:53.900 --> 23:54.740
 on the bottoms of the feet,

23:54.740 --> 23:56.260
 the hands and the upper half of the face,

23:56.260 --> 23:59.960
 you have what are called arteriovenous ostomoses.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.260
 These are portals of blood

24:02.260 --> 24:04.160
 that go directly from arteries to veins.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.540
 And in doing so,

24:05.540 --> 24:10.540
 allow the body to dump heat more readily, more quickly.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.100
 So as it turns out,

24:13.100 --> 24:15.660
 that if you are to cool the palms of the hands,

24:15.660 --> 24:17.460
 the bottoms of the feet and the upper half of the face,

24:17.460 --> 24:20.700
 you can more efficiently reduce core body temperature

24:20.700 --> 24:23.220
 for sake of offsetting hyperthermia

24:23.220 --> 24:25.420
 and for improving athletic performance

24:25.420 --> 24:27.300
 and maybe even cognitive performance.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.180
 So we will return to the specific protocols

24:29.180 --> 24:31.280
 for doing that later in the episode.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.140
 I'll give you a lot of details about how to do that,

24:34.140 --> 24:36.560
 how to do that without the use of any fancy

24:36.560 --> 24:38.260
 or expensive technology.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.400
 There are some technologies

24:39.400 --> 24:41.420
 that are now commercially available.

24:41.420 --> 24:43.060
 For instance, the so-called Coolmit

24:43.060 --> 24:45.180
 that will allow you to do that with maximum efficiency,

24:45.180 --> 24:48.580
 but I'll also give you some at-home methods to do this

24:48.580 --> 24:51.620
 either in the gym or on runs or for sake of cognitive work.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.220
 Okay, so the two key themes again

24:54.220 --> 24:58.480
 are understand that baseline circadian rhythm in temperature

24:58.480 --> 25:01.740
 and understand that the best way to cool the body

25:01.740 --> 25:06.500
 is going to be by making sure that something cold

25:06.500 --> 25:08.340
 contacts the bottoms of your feet,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.500
 the palms of your hands and the upper half of the face.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.860
 Ideally all three if your goal

25:11.860 --> 25:13.880
 is to lower core body temperature quickly.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.120
 And again, just cooling off the back of your neck

25:17.120 --> 25:19.340
 or the top of your head or your torso with a towel

25:19.340 --> 25:21.360
 is going to be the least efficient way

25:21.360 --> 25:22.900
 to lower core body temperature

25:22.900 --> 25:25.780
 and might even increase body temperature

25:25.780 --> 25:27.060
 under certain conditions.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.820
 Okay, with those two points in mind,

25:28.820 --> 25:30.060
 we can start to think about

25:30.060 --> 25:32.660
 directed deliberate cold exposure protocols.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.740
 And there are a number of different reasons

25:34.740 --> 25:36.780
 to use deliberate cold exposure.

25:36.780 --> 25:38.880
 And I want to separate those out for you.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.820
 There are cold protocols that have been tested

25:42.820 --> 25:44.060
 in peer reviewed studies

25:44.060 --> 25:47.140
 that are designed to improve mental performance.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.820
 They are designed to improve things like resilience

25:49.820 --> 25:52.520
 or your grittiness or your ability to move through challenge

25:52.520 --> 25:56.260
 or to regulate your mind and your internal state

25:56.260 --> 25:57.800
 under conditions of stress.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.260
 And we can define stress very specifically

26:00.260 --> 26:03.820
 as times when adrenaline also called epinephrine

26:04.820 --> 26:09.260
 and or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline

26:09.260 --> 26:10.560
 are elevated in your body.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.460
 Forgive me for the noradrenaline nor epinephrine

26:13.460 --> 26:15.260
 adrenaline epinephrine nomenclature.

26:15.260 --> 26:16.460
 I didn't make that up.

26:16.460 --> 26:17.860
 It turns out that every once in a while,

26:17.860 --> 26:20.060
 scientists disagree, imagine that.

26:20.060 --> 26:21.740
 And you'll get multiple scientists

26:21.740 --> 26:23.780
 naming the same molecule different things, okay?

26:23.780 --> 26:26.620
 So epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.340
 I will use them interchangeably.

26:28.340 --> 26:31.180
 Norepinephrine and noradrenaline are the same thing.

26:31.180 --> 26:34.360
 I will use those terms interchangeably.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.060
 Noradrenaline and adrenaline

26:36.060 --> 26:38.060
 are often co-released in the brain and body.

26:38.060 --> 26:41.820
 So they work as kind of a pair to increase our level

26:41.820 --> 26:44.100
 of agitation, our level of focus

26:44.100 --> 26:47.420
 and our desire and our ability to move.

26:47.420 --> 26:50.420
 They are often co-released from different sides

26:50.420 --> 26:52.860
 in the brain and body with dopamine,

26:52.860 --> 26:56.660
 a molecule that is commonly misunderstood

26:56.660 --> 26:58.000
 as the molecule of pleasure,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.300
 but is actually the molecule of motivation,

27:00.300 --> 27:02.720
 reward and pursuit.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.920
 So dopamine, norepinephrine and noradrenaline

27:04.920 --> 27:08.180
 tend to be released together under certain conditions.

27:08.180 --> 27:11.140
 And today you will learn how deliberate cold exposure

27:11.140 --> 27:15.260
 can be used to cause increases in the release of several,

27:15.260 --> 27:16.340
 if not all of these,

27:16.340 --> 27:19.460
 in ways that can improve your levels of attention

27:19.460 --> 27:20.980
 and your mood.

27:20.980 --> 27:25.980
 But the key point is that your mental state is shifted

27:26.700 --> 27:29.700
 when you are exposed to certain forms of cold.

27:29.700 --> 27:33.340
 And many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically

27:33.340 --> 27:35.340
 to shift their body state

27:35.340 --> 27:37.660
 as a way to train their mental state

27:37.660 --> 27:40.460
 so that they can better cope with stress in real life.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.280
 And by real life,

27:41.280 --> 27:43.900
 I mean when life presents stressful events.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.760
 And I will give you specific protocols

27:45.760 --> 27:47.140
 as to how you can do that.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.640
 In other words, how you can become more resilient

27:49.640 --> 27:52.160
 through the use of deliberate cold exposure.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.380
 Now, because of the ways in which deliberate cold exposure

27:55.380 --> 27:57.800
 can increase this category of chemicals

27:57.800 --> 27:58.900
 called the catecholamines,

27:58.900 --> 28:01.700
 that includes dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine,

28:01.700 --> 28:05.820
 it can also be used to elevate mood

28:05.820 --> 28:07.700
 for long periods of time.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.080
 And I'm going to discuss a specific protocol

28:10.080 --> 28:13.040
 that has been shown to increase these chemicals

28:13.040 --> 28:17.060
 anywhere from 2.5X, so 250%,

28:17.060 --> 28:22.060
 to as high as 500% five times over baseline.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.300
 Now you might be asking whether or not it's a good thing

28:26.300 --> 28:29.140
 to raise chemicals like norepinephrine and dopamine

28:29.140 --> 28:31.140
 to such a great degree,

28:31.140 --> 28:32.460
 whether or not that's healthy for us,

28:32.460 --> 28:34.060
 whether or not they can harm us.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.020
 But it turns out that these elevations

28:36.020 --> 28:39.000
 in norepinephrine and dopamine are very long lasting

28:39.000 --> 28:43.580
 in ways that people report feeling vast improvements in mood

28:43.580 --> 28:47.660
 and vast improvements in levels of cognitive attention

28:47.660 --> 28:48.720
 and energy.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.880
 So by my read of the literature,

28:50.880 --> 28:52.980
 these seem to be healthy increases

28:52.980 --> 28:56.540
 in our baseline levels of these chemicals

28:56.540 --> 28:57.740
 in ways that can really support us.

28:57.740 --> 28:59.780
 So I'll give you a protocol for that.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.720
 Now, those are some of the mental effects

29:01.720 --> 29:03.180
 of deliberate cold exposure.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.460
 But deliberate cold exposure has also been studied

29:05.460 --> 29:07.020
 in animal models and in humans

29:07.020 --> 29:09.820
 in the context of increasing metabolism.

29:09.820 --> 29:12.940
 Even in converting certain fat cells

29:12.940 --> 29:14.280
 that we call white fat cells,

29:14.280 --> 29:16.080
 which are the ones where energy is stored,

29:16.080 --> 29:17.420
 they're the ones that we typically think of

29:17.420 --> 29:19.440
 as kind of blubbery fat,

29:19.440 --> 29:23.280
 to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic fat,

29:23.280 --> 29:25.380
 meaning that it can increase core body temperature

29:25.380 --> 29:27.640
 and serves as kind of the furnace

29:27.640 --> 29:31.020
 by which we increase our core metabolism.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.140
 So with a very broad stroke,

29:33.140 --> 29:35.620
 I can say that white fat is generally the kind of fat

29:35.620 --> 29:37.060
 that people want less of,

29:37.060 --> 29:40.140
 and beige fat and brown fat is generally the kind of fat

29:40.140 --> 29:42.540
 that if you're going to have fat cells

29:42.540 --> 29:45.300
 and you certainly need fat cells that you want more of.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.180
 They are thermogenic.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.560
 They help you stay lean.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.100
 They actually serve as a reservoir for heating your body up

29:50.100 --> 29:52.140
 if you're ever confronted with a cold challenge.

29:52.140 --> 29:53.920
 So we're going to talk about how to use cold

29:53.920 --> 29:55.540
 for metabolism as well.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.920
 And of course, people are using deliberate cold exposure

29:57.920 --> 29:59.980
 to reduce inflammation post-exercise,

29:59.980 --> 30:02.660
 to reduce inflammation generally,

30:02.660 --> 30:06.500
 and people are also using cold to enhance performance

30:06.500 --> 30:08.540
 in the context of strength training,

30:08.540 --> 30:10.100
 in the context of endurance training,

30:10.100 --> 30:12.440
 and we'll talk about those data as well.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.920
 But where I'd like to start is with mental performance,

30:14.920 --> 30:18.280
 and I'd like to detail what happens

30:18.280 --> 30:21.420
 when we deliberately expose ourselves to cold.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.620
 It's key to point out the word deliberate.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.620
 If I don't say otherwise, then throughout this episode,

30:27.620 --> 30:30.720
 if I say cold exposure, I mean deliberate cold exposure.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.060
 And the reason I point that out is that as my colleague,

30:33.060 --> 30:35.180
 David Spiegel in the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford

30:35.180 --> 30:38.540
 says, it's not just about the state that we are in,

30:38.540 --> 30:39.940
 it's about the state that we are in

30:39.940 --> 30:41.700
 and whether or not we had anything to do

30:41.700 --> 30:43.900
 with placing ourselves into that state

30:43.900 --> 30:45.880
 and whether or not we did that on purpose or not.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.660
 And what he really means by that statement

30:48.660 --> 30:51.380
 is that there are important effects

30:51.380 --> 30:53.080
 of what we call mindset.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.340
 Mindset was a topic discussed in the guest episode

30:56.340 --> 30:58.620
 with Ali Krum some weeks ago.

30:58.620 --> 31:01.220
 If you haven't seen that episode, I highly recommend it.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.400
 And the science of mindset tells us

31:03.400 --> 31:06.180
 that if we are doing something deliberately

31:06.180 --> 31:08.580
 and we believe that it's going to be good for us,

31:08.580 --> 31:11.420
 it actually can lead to a different set

31:11.420 --> 31:15.720
 of physiological effects than if something is happening

31:15.720 --> 31:18.820
 to us against our will or without our control.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.620
 Now, this is different than placebo effects.

31:20.620 --> 31:23.860
 Placebo effects are distinct from mindset effects.

31:23.860 --> 31:25.320
 If you want to learn more about that distinction,

31:25.320 --> 31:27.260
 please see the episode with Ali Krum.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.340
 But again, when I talk about cold exposure in this episode,

31:30.340 --> 31:33.240
 I'm talking about deliberate cold exposure,

31:33.240 --> 31:35.260
 meaning that you are placing yourself

31:35.260 --> 31:37.660
 into a cold environment on purpose

31:37.660 --> 31:40.920
 in order to extract a particular set of benefits.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.960
 When we talk about deliberate cold exposure,

31:44.960 --> 31:48.060
 almost always that means getting uncomfortable.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.060
 And one of the most common questions I get

31:50.060 --> 31:52.660
 when discussing the use of cold for sake of mental

31:52.660 --> 31:54.680
 or physical performance, metabolism, et cetera,

31:54.680 --> 31:57.300
 is how cold should it be?

31:57.300 --> 31:58.440
 How cold should the water be?

31:58.440 --> 32:00.900
 How cold should the environment be?

32:00.900 --> 32:02.260
 And I just will tell you now,

32:02.260 --> 32:03.720
 and I'm going to say this again and again

32:03.720 --> 32:04.560
 throughout the episode,

32:04.560 --> 32:06.820
 because it will continue to be true throughout the episode

32:06.820 --> 32:08.620
 and long after the episode is over,

32:09.580 --> 32:12.820
 how cold depends on your cold tolerance,

32:12.820 --> 32:15.900
 your core metabolism, and a number of other features

32:15.900 --> 32:20.440
 that there is simply no way I could know or have access to.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.900
 So I would like you to use this rule of thumb.

32:24.580 --> 32:27.340
 If you are using deliberate cold exposure,

32:27.340 --> 32:30.780
 the environment that you place yourself into

32:30.780 --> 32:33.340
 should place your mind into a state of,

32:33.340 --> 32:36.820
 whoa, I would really like to get out of this environment,

32:36.820 --> 32:39.240
 but I can stay in safely.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.220
 Okay, now that might seem a little bit arbitrary,

32:41.220 --> 32:43.560
 but let's say you were to get into a warm shower

32:43.560 --> 32:45.140
 and it would feel really, really nice,

32:45.140 --> 32:47.100
 and you were to start turning down the warm

32:47.100 --> 32:48.360
 and turning up the cold,

32:48.360 --> 32:49.700
 there would be some threshold

32:49.700 --> 32:52.560
 at which it would feel uncomfortable to you.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.700
 And if you were to continue

32:53.700 --> 32:55.540
 to make a little bit colder than that,

32:55.540 --> 32:57.580
 you would really want to get out of the shower,

32:57.580 --> 33:00.120
 but you were confident that you could stay in

33:00.120 --> 33:02.580
 without risking your health, right?

33:02.580 --> 33:04.040
 Without risking a heart attack.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.060
 Now that's very different

33:05.060 --> 33:07.820
 than jumping into a very, very cold lake,

33:07.820 --> 33:10.560
 or I've seen these images of people

33:10.560 --> 33:13.700
 that will cut holes into frozen over lakes

33:13.700 --> 33:16.000
 and they'll get into that cold water.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.200
 If you are trained to do that

33:17.200 --> 33:19.140
 and you have the right conditions, et cetera,

33:19.140 --> 33:21.220
 that can be done reasonably safely,

33:21.220 --> 33:23.740
 but that's certainly not what I would start with.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.540
 And for many people, that will be too cold.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.620
 And indeed, some people can go into cold shock

33:28.620 --> 33:30.140
 and can die as a consequence of getting

33:30.140 --> 33:32.220
 to that extremely cold water very quickly.

33:32.220 --> 33:33.400
 Now that's not to scare you away

33:33.400 --> 33:34.860
 from deliberate cold exposure.

33:34.860 --> 33:38.260
 It's just to say that there's no simple prescriptive

33:38.260 --> 33:39.820
 of how cold to make the environment

33:39.820 --> 33:43.840
 in order to extract maximum benefit for mental

33:43.840 --> 33:46.220
 or physical performance.

33:46.220 --> 33:49.220
 So the simple rule of thumb is going to be,

33:49.220 --> 33:51.120
 place yourself into an environment

33:51.120 --> 33:53.540
 that is uncomfortably cold,

33:53.540 --> 33:55.260
 but that you can stay in safely, okay?

33:55.260 --> 33:56.380
 And you'll have to experiment a bit.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.860
 And that number, meaning that temperature

33:58.860 --> 34:00.180
 will vary from day to day.

34:00.180 --> 34:03.420
 It will vary across the 24 hour cycle

34:03.420 --> 34:06.880
 because of that endogenous, meaning that internal rhythm

34:06.880 --> 34:09.200
 in temperature that I talked about earlier,

34:09.200 --> 34:11.300
 low early in the day, rises into the afternoon,

34:11.300 --> 34:12.460
 drops at night.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.860
 You can actually do this experiment if you like.

34:14.860 --> 34:17.700
 Try getting into a cold shower at 11 o'clock at night,

34:17.700 --> 34:20.480
 if you want, versus try doing it

34:20.480 --> 34:21.980
 in the middle of the afternoon.

34:21.980 --> 34:24.260
 It's quite a different experience.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.580
 And by quite a different experience,

34:25.580 --> 34:29.580
 I mean it requires quite a different degree of resilience

34:29.580 --> 34:31.060
 and leaning into the practice.

34:31.060 --> 34:35.620
 Your willpower will have to be higher, I suspect,

34:35.620 --> 34:39.800
 late in the day as compared to early in the day.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.700
 But that will vary, of course, between individuals as well.

34:42.700 --> 34:43.940
 So the most common question I get

34:43.940 --> 34:45.800
 about deliberate cold exposure is,

34:45.800 --> 34:48.060
 how cold should the water be?

34:48.060 --> 34:50.820
 And we've answered that with uncomfortably cold

34:50.820 --> 34:51.920
 to the point where you want to get out,

34:51.920 --> 34:53.780
 but you can safely stay in.

34:53.780 --> 34:55.480
 The second most common question I get

34:55.480 --> 34:57.840
 about deliberate cold exposure is whether or not

34:57.840 --> 35:00.140
 cold showers are as good, better,

35:00.140 --> 35:03.420
 or worse than cold water immersion up to the neck.

35:03.420 --> 35:05.400
 For instance, I also get a lot of questions

35:05.400 --> 35:08.180
 about whether or not cryo chambers are better

35:08.180 --> 35:10.260
 than all the others, et cetera, et cetera.

35:10.260 --> 35:12.700
 I'm going to make all of that very simple for you

35:12.700 --> 35:15.580
 by saying cold water immersion up to the neck

35:15.580 --> 35:18.220
 with your feet and hands submerged also

35:18.220 --> 35:20.040
 is going to be the most effective.

35:20.940 --> 35:23.700
 Second best would be cold shower.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.020
 Third best would be to go outside

35:26.020 --> 35:28.700
 with a minimum amount of clothing,

35:28.700 --> 35:32.060
 but of course clothing that is culturally appropriate

35:32.060 --> 35:35.100
 and that would allow you to experience cold

35:35.100 --> 35:37.040
 to the point where you would almost want to shiver

35:37.040 --> 35:38.420
 or start shivering.

35:38.420 --> 35:41.340
 Now, there are a number of different important constraints

35:41.340 --> 35:43.340
 that are going to dictate whether or not you use

35:43.340 --> 35:45.380
 one form of cold exposure or the other.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.980
 For instance, some people don't have access

35:46.980 --> 35:48.000
 to cold water immersion.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
 They don't have access to ice baths or cold water tanks,

35:53.140 --> 35:55.180
 cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera.

35:55.180 --> 35:58.760
 In that case, showers would be the next best solution.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.180
 I do want to emphasize that there have been very few,

36:01.180 --> 36:04.360
 if any, studies of cold showers,

36:04.360 --> 36:07.220
 and you can imagine why this would be the case.

36:07.220 --> 36:08.620
 In a laboratory, you want to control

36:08.620 --> 36:10.980
 for as many variables as possible.

36:10.980 --> 36:15.440
 So placing people into a cold water immersion

36:15.440 --> 36:17.260
 or an ice bath up to the neck and insisting

36:17.260 --> 36:19.420
 that they keep their hands and feet under

36:19.420 --> 36:21.240
 is very easy to control.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.580
 It means that everyone can do essentially the same thing.

36:23.580 --> 36:27.280
 Whereas with cold showers, people are different size bodies.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.580
 Some people are going to put their head under.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.260
 Some people are going to lean forward.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.980
 Measuring the amount of cold water exposure on the body

36:33.980 --> 36:35.180
 is very hard to do.

36:35.180 --> 36:38.220
 And so there aren't a lot of studies of cold showers,

36:38.220 --> 36:40.540
 but of course, a lot of people don't have access

36:40.540 --> 36:43.420
 to cold water immersion, so they have to use cold showers.

36:43.420 --> 36:45.400
 And if you don't have access to both, of course,

36:45.400 --> 36:49.500
 then going outside on a cold day can be of benefit.

36:49.500 --> 36:53.400
 But I will point out that the heat transfer

36:53.400 --> 36:56.980
 from your body into water is much higher,

36:56.980 --> 37:00.720
 four times greater, if not even greater,

37:00.720 --> 37:02.400
 depending on the temperature of the water,

37:02.400 --> 37:04.360
 in water, as opposed to in air.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.900
 So it's going to be much more efficient

37:05.900 --> 37:07.760
 to do cold water immersion than anything else,

37:07.760 --> 37:09.140
 cold showers after that,

37:09.140 --> 37:11.680
 and put yourself into a cold environment

37:11.680 --> 37:13.380
 would be the third best thing.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.000
 I'm not going to get into cryochambers

37:15.000 --> 37:18.240
 because they carry quite a high degree of cost.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.620
 And again, there aren't many studies of them.

37:20.620 --> 37:23.060
 So if you have access to cryochambers,

37:23.060 --> 37:24.740
 I'm sure that the cryochamber facility

37:24.740 --> 37:26.340
 has told you about all these incredible benefits,

37:26.340 --> 37:29.040
 and I don't doubt that some of those benefits truly exist,

37:29.040 --> 37:31.340
 but most people just don't have the resources

37:31.340 --> 37:32.380
 or the access to those.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.640
 So we're going to leave cryochambers

37:33.640 --> 37:34.940
 out of today's discussion.

37:34.940 --> 37:37.100
 And of course, I realize there's a fourth category

37:37.100 --> 37:38.400
 of cold exposure out there.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.860
 People who are wearing ice vests,

37:39.860 --> 37:40.860
 believe it or not, those exist.

37:40.860 --> 37:43.400
 Ice underwear, yes, those exist.

37:44.340 --> 37:46.740
 You can look for them on Amazon if you like.

37:46.740 --> 37:49.340
 They are putting cold packs in their armpits

37:49.340 --> 37:50.660
 or in their groin or elsewhere

37:50.660 --> 37:54.460
 in order to stimulate some of the effects of cold

37:54.460 --> 37:56.780
 on mental and physical performance.

37:56.780 --> 37:59.940
 I'm not going to address those in too much detail today.

37:59.940 --> 38:02.420
 They can be efficient in certain ways,

38:02.420 --> 38:04.900
 but as you'll learn about later in the episode,

38:04.900 --> 38:07.460
 cooling the palms, the upper face,

38:07.460 --> 38:08.620
 and the bottoms of the feet

38:08.620 --> 38:10.400
 is going to be far more efficient.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.860
 And unfortunately, I think most of the people

38:12.860 --> 38:15.360
 that are using ice packs to increase their core metabolism

38:15.360 --> 38:18.420
 are not aware of the glabber skin cooling

38:18.420 --> 38:20.820
 and how it can be a very, very potent stimulus.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.100
 So we'll return to that later.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.820
 Unless I say otherwise, I'm mainly going to be focusing

38:25.820 --> 38:28.000
 on cold water immersion and cold showers.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.820
 So let's talk about protocols for enhancing mental health

38:30.820 --> 38:33.560
 and performance using deliberate cold exposure.

38:34.460 --> 38:37.460
 What happens when we get into cold

38:37.460 --> 38:41.440
 is that we experience an increase in norepinephrine,

38:41.440 --> 38:44.500
 in noradrenaline release and in adrenaline release.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.180
 The fact that cold exposure, deliberate or no,

38:47.180 --> 38:50.140
 increases norepinephrine and epinephrine

38:50.140 --> 38:51.740
 in our brain and body

38:51.740 --> 38:54.380
 means that it is a very reliable stimulus

38:54.380 --> 38:56.540
 for increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.400
 That's sort of an obvious statement,

38:58.400 --> 39:02.020
 but that obvious statement can be leveraged

39:02.020 --> 39:05.540
 to systematically build up what we call resilience.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.660
 Now, when we experience a stressor in life,

39:08.660 --> 39:10.820
 whether or not it's something bad happens

39:10.820 --> 39:14.220
 in our relationship or something bad happens in the world,

39:14.220 --> 39:17.820
 and we feel stress, that stress is the consequence

39:17.820 --> 39:21.020
 of increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine

39:21.020 --> 39:21.980
 in our brain and body.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.660
 Very similar, if not identical,

39:23.660 --> 39:24.720
 to the kinds of increases

39:24.720 --> 39:27.180
 that come from deliberate cold exposure.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.940
 So deliberate cold exposure is an opportunity

39:29.940 --> 39:32.940
 to deliberately stress our body.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.520
 And yet, because it's deliberate

39:34.520 --> 39:36.000
 and because we can take certain steps,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.340
 which I'll describe in a moment,

39:38.340 --> 39:41.860
 we can learn to maintain mental clarity.

39:41.860 --> 39:44.300
 We can learn to maintain calm

39:44.300 --> 39:47.500
 while our body is in a state of stress.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.800
 And that can be immensely useful

39:49.800 --> 39:53.300
 when encountering stressors in other parts of life.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.540
 And that's what we call resilience or grit,

39:55.540 --> 39:57.460
 our ability or mental toughness,

39:57.460 --> 40:01.580
 our ability to lean into challenge or to tolerate challenge

40:01.580 --> 40:04.140
 while keeping our heads straight, so to speak.

40:04.140 --> 40:07.700
 So one simple protocol for increasing resilience

40:07.700 --> 40:10.400
 is to pick a temperature that's uncomfortable,

40:10.400 --> 40:12.540
 of shower or cold immersion,

40:12.540 --> 40:15.820
 and then to get in for a certain duration of time,

40:15.820 --> 40:17.200
 and then to get out.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.220
 Now, it's important to understand

40:18.220 --> 40:20.160
 that people will experience different levels

40:20.160 --> 40:22.320
 of norepinephrine and adrenaline release

40:22.320 --> 40:24.140
 when getting into cold water.

40:24.140 --> 40:27.980
 Some people, because they dread the cold so much,

40:27.980 --> 40:29.900
 will actually experience norepinephrine

40:29.900 --> 40:31.040
 and epinephrine increases

40:31.040 --> 40:33.580
 even before they get into the cold water

40:33.580 --> 40:35.100
 or under the cold shower.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.220
 Now, you may have experienced this.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.900
 I've certainly experienced this.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.540
 I'm dreading it, I don't want to do it,

40:39.540 --> 40:41.820
 and I have to force myself to do it.

40:41.820 --> 40:45.580
 And indeed, epinephrine and norepinephrine and its surges

40:45.580 --> 40:47.840
 can be thought of as sort of walls

40:47.840 --> 40:49.920
 that we have to confront and go over.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.020
 And I'd like you to conceptualize them that way

40:52.020 --> 40:54.580
 because it allows us to build protocols

40:54.580 --> 40:57.300
 that can be very objective

40:57.300 --> 40:59.400
 and can allow us to monitor our progress

40:59.400 --> 41:01.260
 in terms of building resilience.

41:01.260 --> 41:03.780
 So one option is to simply say,

41:03.780 --> 41:05.260
 okay, I'm going to force myself

41:05.260 --> 41:07.700
 to get into the cold shower for one minute.

41:07.700 --> 41:08.540
 How cold?

41:08.540 --> 41:10.420
 Again, uncomfortably cold, but you can stay in safely.

41:10.420 --> 41:13.680
 Or I'm going to get into the ice bath for one minute.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.820
 Ice baths are very cold inevitably.

41:16.820 --> 41:20.020
 And what is also inevitable is that when you get

41:20.020 --> 41:22.360
 into the cold, you will experience a surge

41:22.360 --> 41:24.080
 in epinephrine and norepinephrine.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.660
 That's non-negotiable because it's mediated

41:26.660 --> 41:30.060
 by cold receptors on the surface of your body and your skin

41:30.060 --> 41:32.060
 and the way that they trigger the release

41:32.060 --> 41:33.580
 of norepinephrine and epinephrine,

41:33.580 --> 41:35.260
 not just from the adrenals,

41:35.260 --> 41:37.220
 from the adrenal glands above your kidneys,

41:37.220 --> 41:38.780
 but also from regions of your brain,

41:38.780 --> 41:39.940
 like the locus coeruleus,

41:39.940 --> 41:42.900
 which cause increases in attention and alertness,

41:42.900 --> 41:45.260
 and from other locations in your body

41:45.260 --> 41:47.140
 where epinephrine and norepinephrine are released.

41:47.140 --> 41:51.740
 In other words, cold is a non-negotiable stimulus

41:51.740 --> 41:55.100
 for increasing epinephrine and norepinephrine.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.980
 Even if you are the toughest person in the world

41:57.980 --> 42:01.780
 and you love the cold, that increase in epinephrine

42:01.780 --> 42:04.020
 and norepinephrine is going to happen.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.700
 So the way to think about norepinephrine and epinephrine

42:06.700 --> 42:09.220
 in this context of building mental resilience

42:09.220 --> 42:11.440
 is that you have two options.

42:11.440 --> 42:15.340
 You can either try to extend the duration of time

42:15.340 --> 42:17.440
 that you are in the deliberate cold exposure.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.980
 So going from one minute to 75 seconds to two minutes

42:20.980 --> 42:23.380
 and so on over a period of days,

42:23.380 --> 42:26.120
 or one way to approach this

42:26.120 --> 42:27.840
 and the way that I particularly favor

42:27.840 --> 42:31.540
 is to take the context of the day and the moment

42:31.540 --> 42:35.020
 into account, meaning we have different levels of grit

42:35.020 --> 42:37.160
 and resilience on different days

42:37.160 --> 42:39.740
 and depending on the landscape of our life at the time,

42:39.740 --> 42:42.100
 even the time of day that we're doing these protocols,

42:42.100 --> 42:45.540
 and start to be able to sense the release

42:45.540 --> 42:47.380
 of epinephrine, excuse me,

42:47.380 --> 42:49.620
 and norepinephrine in our brain and body,

42:49.620 --> 42:52.500
 and see those as walls that we want to climb over

42:52.500 --> 42:53.900
 in order to build resilience,

42:53.900 --> 42:57.900
 and to start counting the number of walls that we traverse

42:57.900 --> 42:59.760
 and the distance between those walls

42:59.760 --> 43:01.680
 as we do deliberate cold exposure.

43:01.680 --> 43:05.260
 Let me give you an example of the timed protocol

43:05.260 --> 43:06.840
 because that one is very straightforward,

43:06.840 --> 43:09.560
 although I do not think it is as powerful

43:09.560 --> 43:11.000
 for building mental resilience.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.880
 The time protocol would be Monday,

43:12.880 --> 43:15.320
 I do one minute of deliberate cold exposure

43:15.320 --> 43:16.160
 at a given temperature.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.400
 Wednesday, I extend that by 50%.

43:18.400 --> 43:21.680
 And Friday, I do deliberate cold exposure

43:21.680 --> 43:23.800
 for twice as long as I did on Monday.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.200
 And if I were to continue that every week,

43:26.200 --> 43:27.060
 Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

43:27.060 --> 43:29.480
 I would continue to either increase the duration

43:29.480 --> 43:34.120
 or I would lower the temperature and reduce the duration,

43:34.120 --> 43:34.960
 this kind of thing,

43:34.960 --> 43:36.480
 very much like sets and reps in the gym.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.680
 Now that option is very objective, right?

43:38.680 --> 43:40.280
 You could even log it in a book.

43:40.280 --> 43:44.940
 And as you develop the ability to stay in cold temperatures,

43:46.120 --> 43:48.160
 even progressively colder and colder temperatures

43:48.160 --> 43:50.200
 for longer and longer periods of time,

43:50.200 --> 43:52.440
 you will become more resilient.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.600
 What do I mean by that?

43:53.600 --> 43:55.600
 Well, my operational definition of resilience

43:55.600 --> 43:59.120
 is that you are able to resist escape from the stressor,

43:59.120 --> 44:02.880
 the cold, by virtue of your willpower,

44:02.880 --> 44:05.760
 which is really your prefrontal cortex

44:05.760 --> 44:08.800
 causing top-down control on your reflexes

44:08.800 --> 44:10.800
 and your limbic system and your hypothalamus,

44:10.800 --> 44:11.820
 which are basically telling you

44:11.820 --> 44:13.920
 to get out of that cold water,

44:13.920 --> 44:16.040
 get out of that cold environment.

44:16.040 --> 44:19.000
 And in doing so, you are basically getting better

44:19.000 --> 44:21.840
 at controlling your behavior when your brain and body

44:21.840 --> 44:24.000
 are flooded with norepinephrine and epinephrine.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.600
 That's a very reductionist way to explain resilience

44:26.600 --> 44:28.100
 or grit or mental toughness,

44:28.100 --> 44:30.500
 but it's a reductionist way of explaining it

44:30.500 --> 44:32.320
 that is very closely tied to the biology

44:32.320 --> 44:33.640
 and to the psychology.

44:33.640 --> 44:38.160
 And it is a fact that norepinephrine and epinephrine release

44:38.160 --> 44:39.160
 in the brain and body

44:39.160 --> 44:43.500
 are the generic universal code for stressor.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.480
 There is no unique chemical signature

44:45.480 --> 44:46.840
 for different forms of stressors.

44:46.840 --> 44:48.380
 That is the only one.

44:48.380 --> 44:49.220
 Although, of course,

44:49.220 --> 44:50.800
 there are other chemicals involved as well.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.200
 So you could go for time

44:52.200 --> 44:53.720
 and you could try and reduce the temperature

44:53.720 --> 44:57.440
 and increase the time over a period of days or weeks.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.000
 Now that's an attractive way to approach things,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.180
 but the problem is that you don't have

45:02.180 --> 45:06.000
 an infinite amount of room with which to lower temperature

45:06.000 --> 45:08.100
 because eventually you will get into temperatures

45:08.100 --> 45:10.840
 that are either so-called that they are dangerous,

45:10.840 --> 45:13.360
 or you have to stay in cold temperatures

45:13.360 --> 45:16.940
 for such long periods that it becomes impractical

45:16.940 --> 45:18.920
 because presumably you also have to

45:18.920 --> 45:20.440
 take care of other aspects of your life.

45:20.440 --> 45:23.020
 You can't just sit all day in the ice bath.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.220
 Now, for that reason,

45:24.220 --> 45:27.600
 I favor a protocol in which you build mental resilience

45:27.600 --> 45:28.760
 and mental toughness

45:28.760 --> 45:31.060
 through two different types of protocols.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.380
 The first one involves counting walls.

45:33.380 --> 45:34.400
 Now, what do I mean by walls?

45:34.400 --> 45:38.640
 I mean, the sensation of, no, I don't want to do this,

45:38.640 --> 45:42.520
 and the idea or the sensation in your brain and body

45:42.520 --> 45:44.320
 that you actually want to leave that environment

45:44.320 --> 45:45.520
 and go warm up.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.680
 Now, again, for some people,

45:46.680 --> 45:48.520
 that will be even before getting into

45:48.520 --> 45:50.080
 the ice bath or cold shower.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.700
 So if you are feeling very resistant

45:52.700 --> 45:54.800
 to getting into the ice bath or cold shower

45:54.800 --> 45:56.320
 and you manage to do that,

45:56.320 --> 46:00.180
 that's going over what I would call one wall, okay?

46:00.180 --> 46:01.640
 Then for some period of time,

46:01.640 --> 46:05.560
 you might actually feel comfortable in the ice bath,

46:05.560 --> 46:07.760
 cold water, or cold shower,

46:07.760 --> 46:09.520
 and you feel like you could stay there

46:09.520 --> 46:10.420
 for some period of time,

46:10.420 --> 46:12.240
 that you could stay there for a minute or two minutes,

46:12.240 --> 46:15.840
 but inevitably the next wall will arrive.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.620
 And I would encourage you to pay attention

46:17.620 --> 46:19.300
 to when that next wall arrives

46:19.300 --> 46:20.960
 and actually having an awareness,

46:20.960 --> 46:24.340
 that so-called interoceptive awareness, as we call it,

46:24.340 --> 46:27.640
 of when that next surge in adrenaline epinephrine comes

46:27.640 --> 46:30.360
 or whether or not it reaches a certain threshold

46:30.360 --> 46:32.400
 in your brain and body that you feel you want to get out,

46:32.400 --> 46:36.240
 and you're able to stay in for even just 10 seconds longer,

46:36.240 --> 46:39.240
 that means you've traversed yet another wall.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.140
 And if you continue to stay in that cold environment,

46:42.140 --> 46:44.120
 you will find that the next wall will come

46:44.120 --> 46:45.040
 and the next wall will come.

46:45.040 --> 46:48.260
 Now, eventually, of course, you will get very, very numb,

46:48.260 --> 46:49.360
 depending on how cold it is,

46:49.360 --> 46:51.180
 and you could also place yourself into danger.

46:51.180 --> 46:54.000
 So you have to maintain cognitive control,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.260
 counting these walls, traversing these walls,

46:56.260 --> 46:59.120
 but getting out at some point, of course.

46:59.120 --> 47:03.880
 So my favorite protocol for building mental toughness,

47:03.880 --> 47:07.440
 AKA grit, AKA resilience, is to take into account

47:07.440 --> 47:10.120
 that some days just getting into the ice bath

47:10.120 --> 47:11.560
 or cold shower represents a wall.

47:11.560 --> 47:12.640
 Some days it doesn't.

47:12.640 --> 47:13.480
 Some days you get in

47:13.480 --> 47:15.700
 and you feel like you could go 10 minutes.

47:15.700 --> 47:16.540
 Other days you get in

47:16.540 --> 47:18.640
 and you feel like you could only go a minute.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.880
 And setting a designated number of walls

47:20.880 --> 47:22.980
 before you start the protocol

47:22.980 --> 47:24.640
 is going to be very beneficial here.

47:24.640 --> 47:27.060
 So you say, as long as I can do it safely,

47:27.060 --> 47:29.360
 I'm going to do three walls today.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.480
 The first wall is getting in,

47:30.480 --> 47:32.760
 the second wall will arrive when it arrives,

47:32.760 --> 47:35.380
 and the third wall will arrive when it arrives,

47:35.380 --> 47:37.080
 and I'll get over that wall and then I'll get out.

47:37.080 --> 47:38.700
 The next day, you might do five walls.

47:38.700 --> 47:41.920
 The next day, you might do three walls again,

47:41.920 --> 47:43.480
 but you might lower the temperature.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.880
 This gives you tremendous flexibility,

47:45.880 --> 47:48.800
 and indeed, it gives you much more latitude

47:48.800 --> 47:52.480
 to be able to use the same temperatures in different ways,

47:52.480 --> 47:54.700
 or to reduce the temperature only a little bit

47:54.700 --> 47:56.760
 and still get a lot of stimulus,

47:56.760 --> 48:00.140
 meaning a lot of results out of a given protocol.

48:00.140 --> 48:02.880
 Whereas people who are just going for temperature and time

48:02.880 --> 48:04.920
 eventually become cold adapted.

48:04.920 --> 48:07.760
 They get very, very good at doing three minutes

48:07.760 --> 48:10.720
 or six minutes or even 10 minutes at a given temperature.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.880
 And so then they feel like they have to lower the temperature

48:12.880 --> 48:14.480
 even more and even more,

48:14.480 --> 48:16.240
 and eventually they just bottom out.

48:16.240 --> 48:17.280
 There's nowhere else to go.

48:17.280 --> 48:21.100
 There's nowhere to get improvements out of the protocol,

48:21.100 --> 48:24.240
 at least not in terms of mental resilience.

48:24.240 --> 48:27.480
 Of course, there's still the positive effects on inflammation

48:27.480 --> 48:28.520
 and metabolism, et cetera,

48:28.520 --> 48:30.800
 that we'll talk about in a little bit.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.520
 But the key thing here is to design protocols

48:33.520 --> 48:35.600
 that are going to work for you over time.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.380
 And for you very, very hardy,

48:37.380 --> 48:39.520
 very, very tough guys and gals out there

48:39.520 --> 48:41.520
 that can get right into an ice bath

48:41.520 --> 48:43.080
 or a very, very cold immersion,

48:43.080 --> 48:45.480
 and you can just grind it out for six or 10 minutes,

48:45.480 --> 48:48.680
 or you can even do that by remaining peaceful.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.060
 Well, more points to you, but guess what?

48:51.060 --> 48:53.240
 That's the equivalent of already having loaded up

48:53.240 --> 48:56.320
 the barbell with 600 pounds and done your 10 reps.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.960
 There's not a whole lot more variable space

48:58.960 --> 49:02.300
 with which to get benefits from that stimulus.

49:02.300 --> 49:03.400
 And in the weight room,

49:03.400 --> 49:05.280
 people understand that you can adjust, for instance,

49:05.280 --> 49:06.480
 the speed of the movement,

49:06.480 --> 49:07.960
 or you can start combining that movement

49:07.960 --> 49:09.620
 with pre-exhaustion, et cetera.

49:09.620 --> 49:11.080
 With cold exposure,

49:11.080 --> 49:13.580
 you don't have as much variable space to play with.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.660
 So if your goal is to build resilience,

49:15.660 --> 49:18.520
 either go for time as a function of temperature,

49:18.520 --> 49:23.240
 or what I suggest is to start recognizing these walls

49:23.240 --> 49:25.920
 as an experience of resistance in you

49:25.920 --> 49:27.400
 and going over those walls,

49:27.400 --> 49:28.840
 set a certain number of walls

49:28.840 --> 49:31.320
 that you're going to go over on a given day

49:31.320 --> 49:32.760
 and do that at a given temperature,

49:32.760 --> 49:34.680
 and then to mix it up.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.440
 And ideally, you might even throw in one more wall

49:38.440 --> 49:41.120
 at the end if you're really feeling bold and brave,

49:41.120 --> 49:43.460
 because that's going to build out further resilience.

49:43.460 --> 49:45.500
 But if you want cold exposure to work for you

49:45.500 --> 49:46.920
 for sake of building up resilience

49:46.920 --> 49:48.500
 and mental toughness over time,

49:48.500 --> 49:51.360
 you're going to want to vary this parameter space

49:51.360 --> 49:52.760
 in some sort of way,

49:52.760 --> 49:56.080
 and you don't have to be super systematic about it.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.320
 That's the beauty of this kind of approach,

49:58.320 --> 49:59.920
 because you're relying on the fact

49:59.920 --> 50:02.880
 that those walls really represent times

50:02.880 --> 50:05.400
 in which you are forcing your top-down control,

50:05.400 --> 50:08.160
 your prefrontal cortex, to clamp down on your reflex,

50:08.160 --> 50:10.240
 and you're learning behavioral control

50:10.240 --> 50:12.960
 in the context of your body having elevated levels

50:12.960 --> 50:15.520
 of these catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.500
 And that translates to real life

50:17.500 --> 50:19.880
 in a much more realistic way, I believe,

50:19.880 --> 50:21.520
 because in real life,

50:21.520 --> 50:24.280
 you're not really engaging in stressors

50:24.280 --> 50:26.240
 for a given amount of time

50:26.240 --> 50:28.000
 that you know how long it's going to last,

50:28.000 --> 50:28.920
 and you know the context.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.800
 No, most stressors arrive in the form of surprises

50:31.800 --> 50:34.800
 we don't like, text messages that deliver bad news,

50:34.800 --> 50:36.640
 information about the outside world

50:36.640 --> 50:38.880
 or real world and online interactions

50:38.880 --> 50:40.680
 that send our system into a state

50:40.680 --> 50:42.800
 of increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.620
 And if you start to think of those as walls

50:44.620 --> 50:46.060
 that you can tolerate and climb over

50:46.060 --> 50:48.480
 while staying calm and clear of mind,

50:48.480 --> 50:52.120
 then you can really imagine how the ice bath

50:52.120 --> 50:53.760
 and other forms of cold exposure

50:53.760 --> 50:57.760
 are really serving to train you up for real life stressors.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.620
 Okay, the next question that I always get

50:59.620 --> 51:02.180
 is what should my mental state be

51:02.180 --> 51:04.920
 while I'm exposing myself to this uncomfortable

51:04.920 --> 51:07.640
 yet safe condition of cold?

51:07.640 --> 51:09.560
 Well, you have two options,

51:09.560 --> 51:11.600
 and there are probably other options as well.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.960
 One is to try and calm yourself

51:13.960 --> 51:17.640
 to remain as mentally still as possible.

51:17.640 --> 51:21.080
 The other is to lean into that challenge

51:21.080 --> 51:22.600
 and so to grind it out.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.760
 And here, I have to say that this is a lot

51:24.760 --> 51:27.360
 like teaching someone to drive on a gravel road.

51:27.360 --> 51:29.880
 For any of you that have driven on a gravel road,

51:29.880 --> 51:32.840
 you know that there is no optimal speed

51:32.840 --> 51:33.960
 for all gravel roads.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.120
 It depends on the density, the gravel, et cetera,

51:36.120 --> 51:37.720
 and the vehicle, et cetera.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.100
 So for instance, on some gravel roads,

51:40.100 --> 51:42.960
 when you start to drive and the dust starts to kick up,

51:42.960 --> 51:44.660
 your best option is to drive fast

51:44.660 --> 51:46.680
 and put that dust cloud behind you.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.080
 On other gravel roads, if you try and do that,

51:49.080 --> 51:50.760
 the dust actually kicks up around the vehicle

51:50.760 --> 51:51.960
 and it makes it hard to see,

51:51.960 --> 51:53.920
 and sometimes you have to slow down.

51:53.920 --> 51:55.520
 The same thing is true for getting

51:55.520 --> 51:57.480
 through deliberate cold exposure.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.480
 Sometimes it's easier to calm yourself.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.700
 One way to do that is through double inhales

52:01.700 --> 52:03.960
 through the nose and extended exhales through the mouth,

52:03.960 --> 52:06.760
 or simply by trying to control your breathing

52:06.760 --> 52:08.680
 and reduce the pace of your breathing

52:08.680 --> 52:11.200
 and increase the volume of your breathing.

52:11.200 --> 52:14.880
 I have to say that everyone experiences

52:14.880 --> 52:15.780
 a shortening of breath

52:15.780 --> 52:18.300
 when they get into uncomfortably cold water.

52:18.300 --> 52:21.580
 That is a universal physiological response.

52:21.580 --> 52:26.160
 Everyone also experiences a 30 to 80% decrease

52:26.160 --> 52:27.480
 in cognitive function,

52:27.480 --> 52:29.400
 in particular of the frontal cortex.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.400
 The metabolism of your frontal cortex goes down,

52:31.400 --> 52:34.400
 the metabolism, meaning the activity of brain areas

52:34.400 --> 52:36.920
 associated with stress and panic goes way up.

52:36.920 --> 52:41.400
 And so anchoring your mind in cognitive activities

52:41.400 --> 52:44.180
 as you get into the cold can be very, very helpful

52:44.180 --> 52:46.800
 for maintaining clarity of mind.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.780
 In fact, one thing that I sometimes recommend

52:48.780 --> 52:50.640
 is that people try and engage

52:50.640 --> 52:53.680
 in some sort of cognitive exercise while in the cold,

52:53.680 --> 52:55.560
 not as a form of distraction,

52:55.560 --> 52:57.600
 but as a way to maintain clarity of thinking

52:57.600 --> 52:59.840
 and to learn how to do that when the body is flooded

52:59.840 --> 53:02.240
 with all these chemicals that make us stressed.

53:02.240 --> 53:04.200
 So for instance, you could do math problems

53:04.200 --> 53:06.000
 and not two plus two equals four,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.200
 not three times three equals nine,

53:08.200 --> 53:10.700
 but things that require a little bit more focus

53:10.700 --> 53:13.360
 and attention, working memory and so forth.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.440
 You could also start to have thoughts

53:16.440 --> 53:20.560
 that you deliberately impose a full sentence structure on.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.120
 That's actually quite tough.

53:22.120 --> 53:25.280
 You could try and recall specific bouts of information

53:25.280 --> 53:26.120
 that are challenging.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.240
 This is teaching your mind how to stay online,

53:29.240 --> 53:30.080
 or rather I should say,

53:30.080 --> 53:32.460
 this is you teaching your prefrontal cortex

53:32.460 --> 53:33.980
 how to stay engaged

53:33.980 --> 53:36.840
 while you have high levels of stress in your body.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.760
 Years ago, I had a friend who works in the neuroscience

53:40.760 --> 53:42.440
 world, research neuroscientist,

53:42.440 --> 53:45.680
 who is obsessed with this very bizarre sport

53:45.680 --> 53:47.660
 that I don't necessarily recommend at all,

53:47.660 --> 53:50.600
 which is the combination of boxing and chess.

53:50.600 --> 53:51.800
 You may have seen this on YouTube

53:51.800 --> 53:54.560
 where people will box around, legitimate boxing around,

53:54.560 --> 53:56.520
 they're sparring all out often.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.200
 And then at the end of the round,

53:58.200 --> 53:59.260
 instead of resting in the corner,

53:59.260 --> 54:01.000
 they actually sit down and play chess.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.060
 And then they go back to boxing and back to chess.

54:03.060 --> 54:05.560
 Again, not a sport that I recommend,

54:05.560 --> 54:07.120
 but the reason he was obsessed with this

54:07.120 --> 54:10.280
 is because he studies the impact of stress

54:10.280 --> 54:11.360
 on cognitive performance.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.320
 And what that particular very bizarre sport was doing

54:14.320 --> 54:15.600
 was toggling back and forth

54:15.600 --> 54:17.580
 between different states of mind.

54:17.580 --> 54:22.040
 Now it's used both to increase cognitive clarity

54:22.040 --> 54:23.600
 for the fighter when they box

54:23.600 --> 54:25.420
 because staying calm and clear thinking

54:25.420 --> 54:27.840
 is very important to winning boxing matches.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.760
 Believe it or not, it's not an all outrage.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.200
 It's a very calculated game of mental chess

54:32.200 --> 54:34.520
 and physical chess that's quite high stakes,

54:34.520 --> 54:35.480
 as you can imagine.

54:36.480 --> 54:40.700
 It's also used in some circles as a way to teach people

54:40.700 --> 54:42.640
 how to engage in cognitive performance

54:42.640 --> 54:44.360
 when their body is simply filled with stress.

54:44.360 --> 54:46.820
 So in the boxing chess example,

54:46.820 --> 54:49.040
 the replacement for the cold water

54:49.040 --> 54:50.320
 is actually the boxing, right?

54:50.320 --> 54:52.280
 It's the thing that's supposed to induce the stress

54:52.280 --> 54:53.700
 because getting hit is stressful

54:53.700 --> 54:56.960
 and the risk of getting hit is stressful for most people.

54:56.960 --> 55:00.700
 So again, if you think about deliberate cold exposure

55:00.700 --> 55:02.540
 as a way of just systematically

55:02.540 --> 55:04.400
 and reliably inducing epinephrine

55:04.400 --> 55:07.000
 and norepinephrine release and delivering stress,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.720
 well, then this idea of maintaining cognitive clarity

55:09.720 --> 55:11.600
 and actually engaging in cognitive tasks

55:11.600 --> 55:14.240
 while in the ice bath or cold shower

55:14.240 --> 55:15.600
 can actually be very beneficial,

55:15.600 --> 55:16.940
 even though it might sound a little bit silly.

55:16.940 --> 55:18.640
 You're really training up your ability

55:18.640 --> 55:20.400
 to keep your brain working

55:20.400 --> 55:24.160
 when the reflex is to shut down the parts of your brain

55:24.160 --> 55:26.300
 that are involved in deliberate planning and thinking.

55:26.300 --> 55:29.280
 Now, another important aspect of deliberate cold exposure

55:29.280 --> 55:32.240
 that I rarely, if ever hear discussed,

55:32.240 --> 55:34.480
 but is vitally important

55:34.480 --> 55:37.640
 is whether or not you move around or not.

55:37.640 --> 55:38.860
 And here's the reason.

55:38.860 --> 55:40.580
 When you get into cold water

55:41.600 --> 55:44.240
 and you remain there for some period of time,

55:44.240 --> 55:46.520
 your body is generating heat

55:46.520 --> 55:49.340
 and that heat generates what's called a thermal layer

55:49.340 --> 55:51.240
 that surrounds your entire body.

55:52.220 --> 55:54.360
 So if you stay still,

55:54.360 --> 55:57.240
 you are actually warmer than if you move around.

55:57.240 --> 55:58.440
 You can try this the next time

55:58.440 --> 55:59.920
 you're doing your deliberate cold exposure.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.160
 If you're submerged up to the neck,

56:01.160 --> 56:03.680
 sit there for about 10, 30 seconds

56:03.680 --> 56:05.480
 and be very, very still of body.

56:05.480 --> 56:07.360
 In fact, this is the way that most people

56:07.360 --> 56:09.080
 start to do deliberate cold exposure.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.420
 They give this very stoic look.

56:10.420 --> 56:11.260
 They don't blink.

56:11.260 --> 56:12.080
 They look very peaceful.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.780
 Some of them even look tough,

56:13.780 --> 56:17.760
 or they make a very even, A, emotional face

56:17.760 --> 56:20.140
 and so it looks like they're really tough,

56:20.140 --> 56:22.360
 but they are so still that, believe it or not,

56:22.360 --> 56:26.520
 they're not providing the most potent stimulus.

56:26.520 --> 56:30.660
 If they or you were to move around in that water,

56:30.660 --> 56:32.680
 what would happen is you'd break up the thermal layer

56:32.680 --> 56:35.960
 and that you actually experienced that as much colder.

56:35.960 --> 56:39.120
 So if you really want to push the resilience aspect,

56:39.120 --> 56:42.040
 or for instance, if you want to use a given temperature

56:42.040 --> 56:43.240
 that you're comfortable in,

56:43.240 --> 56:45.520
 but that you want to increase the stimulus

56:45.520 --> 56:47.360
 and you want to get some more benefit

56:47.360 --> 56:49.160
 for mental resilience training,

56:49.160 --> 56:51.560
 well, then get into the cold water,

56:51.560 --> 56:53.800
 move your body around continuously,

56:53.800 --> 56:55.340
 but try and keep your mind still

56:55.340 --> 56:57.540
 or even do some sort of cognitive task.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.160
 So as you're starting to realize

56:59.160 --> 57:00.320
 there are a bunch of different variables

57:00.320 --> 57:01.240
 that you can play with

57:01.240 --> 57:03.720
 while maintaining the same temperature of water,

57:03.720 --> 57:06.920
 and in doing so, really keep you in the zone

57:06.920 --> 57:10.820
 of what should and absolutely has to be safe for you

57:10.820 --> 57:13.120
 without having to just continually drop the temperature

57:13.120 --> 57:15.720
 from say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33,

57:15.720 --> 57:16.640
 because as I mentioned before,

57:16.640 --> 57:18.240
 eventually you're going to bottom out.

57:18.240 --> 57:20.720
 So if you're one of those people that likes to look tough

57:20.720 --> 57:22.880
 or really relaxed while you're in the ice bath

57:22.880 --> 57:24.080
 or cold water immersion,

57:24.080 --> 57:26.760
 just realize that you're actually cheating yourself

57:26.760 --> 57:28.320
 out of part of the stimulus.

57:28.320 --> 57:29.840
 Keep those limbs moving,

57:29.840 --> 57:33.600
 and of course, limbs under the water, feet and hands,

57:33.600 --> 57:35.720
 is going to be a more potent stimulus

57:35.720 --> 57:37.640
 than hands and feet out

57:37.640 --> 57:39.180
 for reasons that should be obvious

57:39.180 --> 57:40.160
 based on what we talked about

57:40.160 --> 57:42.320
 in terms of glab or skin cooling.

57:42.320 --> 57:45.420
 So keep those submerged, move your body, pedal,

57:45.420 --> 57:47.040
 maybe move your knees up and down,

57:47.040 --> 57:48.740
 pedal your feet, and trust me,

57:48.740 --> 57:50.080
 it's going to feel a lot colder

57:50.080 --> 57:52.260
 than were you to remain stone still.

57:52.260 --> 57:53.440
 Another very common question

57:53.440 --> 57:56.720
 is how often to do deliberate cold exposure.

57:56.720 --> 57:59.340
 It's tough to make a recommendation on that

57:59.340 --> 58:01.720
 based on any peer reviewed study,

58:01.720 --> 58:03.240
 although there are a few in humans

58:03.240 --> 58:07.520
 that point to a threshold of 11 minutes total per week.

58:07.520 --> 58:09.400
 So that's total throughout the week,

58:09.400 --> 58:11.600
 divided into two or four sessions

58:11.600 --> 58:13.540
 of two or three minutes or so.

58:13.540 --> 58:16.320
 Now that 11 minute cutoff is not a strict threshold

58:16.320 --> 58:20.100
 and is actually geared more towards increases in metabolism.

58:20.100 --> 58:22.920
 We'll get into this a little bit later in the episode,

58:22.920 --> 58:25.600
 but I think the 11 minute threshold,

58:25.600 --> 58:29.020
 meaning 11 minutes total of deliberate cold exposure per week

58:29.020 --> 58:31.440
 is a pretty good number to use

58:31.440 --> 58:34.940
 if you need a number in order to keep you consistent.

58:34.940 --> 58:36.400
 But as we talked about earlier,

58:36.400 --> 58:39.480
 some of you are going to be in the ice bath

58:39.480 --> 58:42.020
 or cold immersion or cold shower for one minute.

58:42.020 --> 58:44.120
 Others of you will be in there for 10 minutes

58:44.120 --> 58:47.560
 depending on how frequent and how high, if you will,

58:47.560 --> 58:50.160
 those walls of adrenaline are coming.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.180
 So for some of you getting into a cold shower

58:53.180 --> 58:54.960
 for three minutes total for the whole week

58:54.960 --> 58:58.080
 will represent a tremendous achievement

58:58.080 --> 59:00.800
 in terms of willpower and overcoming the resistance

59:00.800 --> 59:02.360
 to doing that, overcoming those walls.

59:02.360 --> 59:04.960
 For others of you, three minutes is nothing.

59:04.960 --> 59:06.880
 So what do I recommend?

59:06.880 --> 59:11.080
 I recommend that you get at least 11 minutes total per week,

59:11.080 --> 59:13.240
 but at the point where 11 minutes total per week

59:13.240 --> 59:15.760
 is very easy for you or is no longer representing

59:15.760 --> 59:17.160
 a significant mental challenge,

59:17.160 --> 59:19.080
 meaning you're not experiencing many of these walls,

59:19.080 --> 59:21.760
 you're excited to get into the cold shower or immersion,

59:21.760 --> 59:24.560
 you're going through it easily, you're cruising basically,

59:24.560 --> 59:27.800
 then I would say either lower the temperature safely,

59:27.800 --> 59:31.400
 of course, extend the duration safely, of course,

59:31.400 --> 59:33.840
 or increase the frequency so that you're doing this

59:33.840 --> 59:36.660
 perhaps every day or maybe five days a week

59:36.660 --> 59:37.520
 or three days a week.

59:37.520 --> 59:39.320
 I personally get tremendous benefit

59:39.320 --> 59:42.480
 from doing deliberate cold exposure three times a week

59:42.480 --> 59:45.560
 and using the walls method that I described earlier

59:45.560 --> 59:47.440
 as my gauge for how long to stay in.

59:47.440 --> 59:50.320
 And typically that means that I'm staying in for anywhere

59:50.320 --> 59:53.880
 from two minutes to six minutes per session.

59:53.880 --> 59:58.600
 And that averages out to about 11 to 15 minutes total

59:58.600 --> 59:59.580
 per week.

59:59.580 --> 1:00:02.880
 So again, I do not think that you need to be super strict

1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:04.200
 about these guidelines.

1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:06.920
 It's most important when embracing a protocol,

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:08.220
 A, that you do it safely,

1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:11.340
 but secondarily that you do it consistently.

1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:13.120
 So find what you can do consistently

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:15.120
 and then vary the parameters that will allow you

1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:18.360
 to continue to do deliberate cold exposure consistently,

1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:20.520
 regardless of whether or not you have access to a shower

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:22.160
 or a cold immersion, et cetera.

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:24.400
 Okay, so we've been talking about mental effects

1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:26.280
 and the use of deliberate cold exposure

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:28.040
 for sake of building resilience,

1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:30.600
 which I do believe can be tremendously powerful.

1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:35.040
 Look, it's no coincidence that the screening

1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:38.900
 and the training for Navy SEALs involves a lot of exposure

1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:40.080
 to cold water.

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:41.780
 One could argue that it is deliberate

1:00:41.780 --> 1:00:43.720
 because they elect to go to BUDs,

1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:46.400
 but when they get into the cold water at BUDs

1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:48.660
 is dictated by the instructors.

1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:52.260
 And the reason they use cold water exposure as the stressor

1:00:52.260 --> 1:00:55.200
 is that it does offer considerable leeway

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.000
 in terms of duration and temperature,

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.780
 in terms of how you can use it as a stressor,

1:01:00.780 --> 1:01:04.000
 whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space.

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.640
 As we say, there isn't a lot of room

1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:09.600
 beyond which you start injuring or even killing people

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:10.720
 by using heat.

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.540
 So there are a lot of forms of stressors out there,

1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:14.540
 but cold is one that we can titrate,

1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:16.440
 that we can adjust in ways that can allow us

1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:21.440
 to continually build up and or maintain mental toughness.

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:25.600
 Now, deliberate cold exposure also has many effects

1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:28.760
 on chemicals other than norepinephrine and epinephrine,

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:32.000
 most notably the neuromodulator dopamine,

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.400
 which is involved in elevating our mood,

1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:38.120
 making us feel energized and enhancing our ability to focus.

1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:41.160
 And that has a lot to do with how dopamine engages us

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:44.560
 in motivated states, tends to narrow our thinking

1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:46.720
 and our behavior into a particular trench

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:47.980
 of goal-directed behavior.

1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:50.560
 If you want to learn more about dopamine,

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.360
 you can learn a lot about dopamine

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:54.120
 in our episode about dopamine.

1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.300
 It's at hubermanlab.com.

1:01:55.300 --> 1:01:56.140
 You can find it.

1:01:56.140 --> 1:01:59.280
 It's a two and a half hour plus kind of deep dive

1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:02.900
 into all things dopamine, focus, motivation, et cetera.

1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:08.700
 Deliberate cold exposure has a very powerful effect

1:02:08.700 --> 1:02:11.060
 on the release of dopamine in our brain and body.

1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:13.000
 And this is one of the main reasons

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.080
 why people continue to do deliberate cold exposure.

1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:19.160
 Basically, it makes us feel good

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:21.280
 and it continues to make us feel good

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:23.760
 even after we get out of the cold environment.

1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:25.440
 In fact, some people would say

1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:26.980
 they don't feel good in the cold environment.

1:02:26.980 --> 1:02:30.140
 It's all stress for them, but afterwards they feel great.

1:02:30.140 --> 1:02:32.280
 One of our previous guests, Dr. Anna Lempke,

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:33.440
 who's a medical doctor

1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:34.920
 at Stanford University School of Medicine,

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:37.280
 she's a close colleague of mine,

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:39.520
 described the use of dopamine in her book,

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:41.260
 dopamine nation, an incredible book

1:02:41.260 --> 1:02:43.400
 about addiction and dopamine, I should mention,

1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:48.400
 and the use of dopamine elicited by cold water exposure

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:50.600
 by one of her patients.

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.800
 What I'm referring to is the fact that one of her patients

1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:57.080
 helped themselves get and stay sober off drugs

1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:01.000
 by using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine.

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.080
 So a healthier form of dopamine release

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:07.020
 than they were engaged in prior to getting sober.

1:03:07.020 --> 1:03:09.900
 Now, the basis for dopamine release

1:03:09.900 --> 1:03:11.440
 in response to cold exposure

1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:14.040
 is that the catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine,

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:16.560
 and dopamine tend to be co-released

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.640
 by the same sorts of stimuli,

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:21.380
 but most stressors, and in particular things

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:24.800
 that evoke stress or our feelings of stress internally

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.980
 that we don't like, do not increase dopamine.

1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:30.520
 They only increase norepinephrine and epinephrine,

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.200
 but deliberate cold exposure

1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:36.040
 seems to cause a dramatic increase in dopamine,

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.800
 and this has actually been substantiated

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:39.640
 in a really beautiful study

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:42.520
 entitled Human Physiological Responses to Immersion

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.640
 into Water of Different Temperatures.

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.940
 The first author is Sramek.

1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:49.760
 I'm almost certainly pronouncing that poorly,

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:54.200
 if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K.

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:55.800
 This was published in the European Journal

1:03:55.800 --> 1:03:58.400
 of Applied Physiology in the year 2000.

1:03:58.400 --> 1:03:59.480
 Really a beautiful study.

1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:00.660
 I love this study.

1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:04.480
 They took people and they had them sit in chairs underwater,

1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:06.720
 but their head was out and so they were immersed

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.320
 up to the neck in either of three different temperatures,

1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:13.960
 excuse me, 32 degrees Celsius,

1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:17.440
 which is 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius,

1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:21.000
 which is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, or 14 degrees Celsius,

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.720
 which is 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:27.380
 So not super cold, but then what they did

1:04:27.380 --> 1:04:29.960
 is they measured people's core body temperature throughout.

1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:31.520
 They measured their metabolism

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:33.720
 and they looked at serum levels

1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:36.280
 of things like norepinephrine, epinephrine,

1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:39.360
 dopamine, and cortisol, serum meaning within the blood.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:42.240
 So a really nice and quite thorough study.

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:46.240
 There were not a huge number of subjects in the study,

1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:48.460
 but nonetheless, it was a very thorough study

1:04:48.460 --> 1:04:52.600
 in terms of the number of variables that they explored.

1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:55.580
 So I just want to briefly highlight some of what they saw

1:04:55.580 --> 1:04:57.720
 or what they observed in this study.

1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:01.640
 First of all, all the groups were in the water

1:05:01.640 --> 1:05:04.480
 of a given temperature for one hour,

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:06.220
 which is much longer than most

1:05:06.220 --> 1:05:08.080
 of the deliberate cold exposure protocols

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:09.460
 that anyone is using at home.

1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:12.200
 I mean, maybe you're taking one hour long cold showers.

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.440
 Maybe you're getting into the ice bath for an hour,

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:15.500
 although I don't recommend that.

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:18.360
 I think you'd probably get badly hypothermic.

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:21.420
 Or maybe you're getting into a cold water immersion

1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:22.480
 for some period of time,

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:24.980
 but I have a hard time imagining that it would be an hour

1:05:24.980 --> 1:05:27.100
 and I don't suggest that if it's very cold.

1:05:27.100 --> 1:05:28.900
 So this study focused on actually

1:05:28.900 --> 1:05:31.800
 somewhat moderately cool temperatures,

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:33.960
 not what I think most people would consider

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.640
 very, very cold temperatures,

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:38.380
 but extended the duration for quite a while.

1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:42.120
 So again, 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius,

1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:45.700
 or 14 degrees Celsius, here's what they observed.

1:05:45.700 --> 1:05:48.720
 The group that was immersed up to the neck

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:51.920
 in 32 degrees Celsius, that is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:55.380
 water did not experience a shift in metabolism

1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:58.960
 nor a significant increase in dopamine norepinephrine

1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:01.020
 or these other catecholamines.

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:03.640
 The group that was in 20 degrees Celsius,

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:08.120
 meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit water for an hour,

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:12.040
 experienced a 93% increase in metabolic rate,

1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:15.920
 which is remarkable given that the water wasn't that cold

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:18.520
 and yet an hour is a pretty long time to be in there.

1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:21.280
 And again, it speaks to the dramatic effect

1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:23.680
 of heat transfer that water has,

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:25.580
 which I mentioned earlier as opposed to being out

1:06:25.580 --> 1:06:27.340
 in the air at 68 degrees,

1:06:27.340 --> 1:06:29.580
 it would certainly not cause that increase

1:06:29.580 --> 1:06:30.560
 in metabolic rate.

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:34.980
 The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius,

1:06:34.980 --> 1:06:39.120
 meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit water for an hour,

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:42.780
 experienced a 350% increase in metabolism.

1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:45.240
 So huge increases in metabolism.

1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:48.680
 Now, the most interesting data to me,

1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:50.520
 at least in terms of mental effects

1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:52.400
 of deliberate cold exposure,

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:57.400
 were that the plasma or serum levels of norepinephrine

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:01.640
 in the blood increased 530%.

1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:04.360
 These are huge increases in norepinephrine.

1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:07.240
 So it suggests that this is a stressful stimulus,

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:10.020
 at least neurochemically speaking, stressful,

1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:12.280
 despite the fact that it's not super, super cold,

1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:15.960
 although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius

1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:20.360
 is not a, you know, it's not a warm environment,

1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:22.560
 but it's not a ultra, ultra cold environment,

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.960
 but an hour is a very long time to be in there.

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:31.560
 The subjects also experienced a 250% increase

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:36.680
 in dopamine concentrations, which while not 530%,

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:38.080
 as it was with norepinephrine,

1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:40.640
 is still a very large increase

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:42.480
 in baseline levels of dopamine.

1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:44.780
 And what was interesting is that those increases

1:07:44.780 --> 1:07:48.160
 in dopamine persisted for a very long period of time

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:51.520
 and afterwards, even out to two hours, okay?

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:54.400
 And they stopped the study after 120 minutes

1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:58.200
 of getting out of the cold, but nonetheless,

1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:01.800
 these increases in norepinephrine are huge and long lasting,

1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:03.320
 and these increases in dopamine

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.800
 are very large and long lasting.

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:08.880
 And I do believe that these documented effects in humans

1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:12.320
 explain much of the enhancement of attention

1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:14.360
 and of feelings of wellbeing and mood

1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:16.400
 that people typically experience

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:19.080
 after doing deliberate cold exposure.

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:22.800
 And the reason I say that is that if you were to go back

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:24.720
 to the episode that I did on dopamine,

1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:27.040
 or you were to go back to the episode that I did

1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:29.740
 with Dr. Anna Lemke on addiction and dopamine,

1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:32.840
 what you would find is that increases in dopamine

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:35.840
 of the sort evoked by deliberate cold exposure

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:38.100
 are actually very similar to the kinds of increases

1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:41.400
 in dopamine that are elicited by things like nicotine

1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:44.720
 or from other behaviors that are known to be addictive

1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:47.620
 and bad for us because they lead to other effects

1:08:47.620 --> 1:08:50.240
 on the brain and body that we simply don't want.

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:53.840
 And yet deliberate cold exposure, provided it's done safely,

1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:57.640
 can create similar, if not greater, increases in dopamine

1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:00.680
 that are not just fleeting,

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:02.080
 that don't just occur during, say,

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:05.180
 the consumption of some deleterious drug or activity,

1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:06.440
 but that are very long lasting

1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.520
 and that can be leveraged toward activities

1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:11.820
 other than deliberate cold exposure.

1:09:11.820 --> 1:09:13.100
 So I want to emphasize this.

1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:15.680
 I'm not suggesting that people do deliberate cold exposure

1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:16.840
 for an hour a day,

1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:19.680
 and unfortunately there are not many studies

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:22.240
 yet exploring how shorter,

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:25.000
 colder temperature environment exposure,

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.140
 say one minute or three minutes or six minutes

1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:32.140
 at 55 degrees or at 50 degrees,

1:09:32.140 --> 1:09:34.640
 whether or not that leads to similar,

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:38.780
 greater or reduced levels of dopamine in the brain and body.

1:09:38.780 --> 1:09:42.580
 And yet almost everybody who does deliberate cold exposure

1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:45.660
 will say, yeah, it was stressful, I didn't enjoy it,

1:09:45.660 --> 1:09:47.360
 or I eventually grew to like it,

1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:49.640
 but that I always feel better afterwards.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:52.680
 And then that feeling lasts a very long period of time.

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:56.100
 And I think it's almost certain that those experiences

1:09:56.100 --> 1:09:58.820
 that people report relate to these increases in dopamine

1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:02.000
 and in concert with the increases in norepinephrine

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.480
 also explain the other effect that's commonly reported,

1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:06.960
 which is an enhancement in mental acuity

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:09.160
 and the ability to focus.

1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:11.720
 Now, here we can extrapolate to the study

1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:14.860
 that I discussed at the early part of the episode

1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:15.900
 where I was talking about the use

1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:18.120
 of short 15 minute exercise,

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:19.760
 kind of moderate intensity exercise,

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:22.760
 and how that was shown to increase levels of energy

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:23.760
 and mental acuity

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:26.320
 in these working memory visual attention tasks.

1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:29.320
 And there again, we have to assume somewhat

1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:31.440
 because they weren't doing neurochemical measurements,

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:34.040
 but we can reasonably assume

1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:36.640
 that those improvements in cognitive performance

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:39.760
 were due at least in part to the increase in catecholamines

1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:43.720
 known to accompany moderate intensity zone to cardio.

1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:45.800
 So what you're starting to see here is a theme.

1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:49.240
 The theme is that virtually any stimulus

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:51.660
 that delivers more norepinephrine, epinephrine,

1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:54.640
 and dopamine to our system will sharpen our mental acuity

1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:55.640
 and elevate our mood,

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:58.280
 and will do so for some period of time.

1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:00.480
 Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out,

1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:03.480
 is a very potent way to increase these catecholamines,

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:04.800
 this category of chemicals,

1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:07.640
 and thereby to improve mood, mental acuity,

1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:09.160
 and levels of alertness.

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:13.040
 And as we'll next see, it not only has that effect,

1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:15.080
 which can be very beneficial for many people

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:16.920
 in a bunch of different circumstances,

1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:19.680
 but it also has the positive effects

1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:22.560
 that many people seek in terms of metabolism

1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:24.320
 in lowering inflammation in the body

1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:26.600
 and other physiological effects as well.

1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.840
 And forgive me, I was almost ready to move on

1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:31.560
 to effects of deliberate cold exposure

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:34.280
 on metabolism and inflammation and so forth,

1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:35.640
 but I neglected to point out

1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:38.600
 one of the other very interesting aspects

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:41.680
 of the study showing deliberate cold exposure

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:44.160
 can increase norepinephrine and dopamine,

1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.120
 which is that they observed no significant increases

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.240
 in the stress hormone cortisol.

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:53.640
 And that is both surprising, interesting, and important,

1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:57.460
 because what it means is that the quality of stress

1:11:57.460 --> 1:12:00.740
 that deliberate cold exposure is creating in the body

1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:04.520
 is likely to be one of what we call eustress.

1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:07.400
 Hans Selye, the great physiologist,

1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:10.800
 won a Nobel Prize for distinguishing between distress,

1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:13.200
 which is stress in the brain and body

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:16.560
 that causes the release of things like cortisol

1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:17.960
 along with the other catecholamines

1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:20.720
 and that we experience as negative happening to us

1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:22.880
 and can lead to negative health outcomes.

1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:25.400
 And he distinguished that from eustress,

1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:27.880
 which was stress that we now understand

1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:29.720
 is associated with increases in things

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.440
 like norepinephrine and dopamine,

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:35.000
 but no increases or minimal increases in cortisol,

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.560
 and that can lead to positive health outcomes.

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:40.380
 So it appears that deliberate cold exposure

1:12:40.380 --> 1:12:42.100
 can create what we call,

1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:44.800
 or what Hans Selye called eustress.

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:46.560
 In other words, it can create a condition

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:49.860
 in the brain and body in which we are stressing ourselves,

1:12:49.860 --> 1:12:51.200
 we are training up resilience,

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:54.160
 and yet we are creating a neurochemical milieu

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:56.360
 that actually has many health benefits.

1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:57.600
 Now I'd like to shift our attention

1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:00.780
 to the effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism.

1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:03.320
 And I'd like to start by detailing a study

1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.160
 that was performed on humans

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:07.740
 and published just at the end of last year.

1:13:07.740 --> 1:13:08.800
 The title of the study is

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.840
 Altered Brown Fat Thermoregulation

1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:13.620
 and Enhanced Cold Induced Thermogenesis

1:13:13.620 --> 1:13:15.980
 in Young Healthy Winter Swimming Men.

1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:17.760
 And I should point out that

1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:20.600
 while the study was only performed on male subjects,

1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:22.300
 there's no reason to think that

1:13:22.300 --> 1:13:23.560
 the effects that they discovered

1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:25.160
 would only pertain to men.

1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:27.120
 I would hope that they would also do a study on women

1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:28.800
 at some point in the future,

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:30.840
 but the effects that they describe

1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:34.700
 are very basic core physiological processes.

1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:37.200
 What they did is they looked at deliberate cold exposure

1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:38.720
 in this group of young men,

1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:42.960
 and they used that 11 minute threshold per week.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:46.760
 So in other words, they had them get into cold water

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:50.160
 for approximately 11 minutes per week.

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:53.600
 And again, that's 11 minutes total per week.

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.000
 They divided that into two sessions,

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.760
 although in speaking with the first author of the study,

1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:00.000
 Dr. Susanna Soberg,

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.320
 I learned that it probably is not important

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:03.500
 that it be two sessions.

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:06.280
 It could be three or even four sessions

1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:08.940
 as long as it reaches that 11 minute threshold.

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:11.520
 What they discovered was that

1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:14.840
 by going into these cold environments,

1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:17.960
 in this case, cold water immersion up to the neck

1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:21.240
 for 11 minutes total per week,

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:23.800
 that these men experienced increases

1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:26.660
 in so-called brown fat thermogenesis.

1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:28.720
 I'll talk more about what that is in a moment

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:30.800
 and increases in core body temperature

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.920
 that translate to increases in core body metabolism.

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:37.820
 Now, the overall increases in core body metabolism

1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:42.820
 that they experienced were not extremely large.

1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:44.600
 They were statistically significant,

1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:45.960
 but they weren't extremely large.

1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:50.400
 However, the changes in brown fat stores

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:53.080
 are perhaps what's most interesting about this study.

1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:54.420
 And I'll tell you why.

1:14:54.420 --> 1:14:57.580
 The metabolic increases of deliberate cold exposure

1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:00.280
 are both acute, meaning happening in the short term,

1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:02.900
 when you get into the cold and immediately after,

1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:06.440
 one does experience an increase in core metabolism.

1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.360
 You burn some calories, in other words.

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.520
 And while those might not be very significant increases,

1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:17.740
 or I should say they can be statistically significant,

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:20.720
 but they are not enormously large numbers

1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:22.620
 of calories burned,

1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:27.200
 the longer lasting effects of deliberate cold exposure

1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:30.680
 on metabolism seem to take place by changes that occur

1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:34.100
 in the types of fat that we store in our body

1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:36.680
 and the way that that fat impacts our metabolism

1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:40.120
 at other times throughout the 24-hour cycle.

1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:44.660
 This actually has a somewhat anecdotal basis,

1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:46.880
 in particular in Scandinavia.

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:49.440
 I don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish,

1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:52.960
 nor do I speak Norwegian, but I do have Danish relatives.

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:55.400
 And they were able to help me decipher

1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:58.020
 a common Swedish saying,

1:15:58.020 --> 1:16:01.120
 which essentially translates to the fact that

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:04.320
 in preparation for the summer, they say,

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:09.000
 one should expose themselves to warm environments

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.080
 so that one is comfortable

1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:13.120
 in warm environments in the summer.

1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:16.440
 That's one half of this traditional Swedish

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:17.940
 and also Danish saying.

1:16:17.940 --> 1:16:22.380
 The other half of this traditional Danish Swedish saying

1:16:22.380 --> 1:16:24.800
 is that in preparation for winter,

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:28.760
 in order to not feel too cold in cold environments,

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:31.300
 one should prepare for those in the fall

1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:34.240
 by not wearing a jacket and exposing oneself

1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:36.200
 to cold environments.

1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:40.120
 Now, of course, this is just anecdotal cultural lore,

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:42.200
 but it actually has a physiological basis,

1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:46.400
 which is by exposing oneself to cold environments

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:50.040
 on a repeated basis in anticipation of exposure

1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:52.100
 to more extreme cold environments,

1:16:52.100 --> 1:16:54.920
 one can feel more comfortable in those extreme

1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:56.000
 cold environments.

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.180
 And that's exactly what they observed

1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.380
 in this study by Soberg et al.

1:17:00.380 --> 1:17:03.940
 The men felt more comfortable in extreme cold

1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:07.380
 if they had trained through deliberate cold exposure,

1:17:07.380 --> 1:17:09.880
 which might not seem surprising at all,

1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:12.280
 but based on what we talked about earlier,

1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:16.040
 whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes this discomfort

1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:18.640
 and this experience of norepinephrine release,

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:20.700
 at least in the short term,

1:17:20.700 --> 1:17:22.680
 then you would say, well, shouldn't that deliberate

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:25.240
 cold exposure also make them feel uncomfortable,

1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:26.680
 like they really want to get out?

1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:29.600
 Well, that is true at the beginning

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.420
 of a deliberate cold exposure protocol,

1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:33.480
 meaning in the first week or in the second week

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:36.320
 or the third week, but what one finds and what you will find

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:38.980
 if you do deliberate cold exposure consistently

1:17:38.980 --> 1:17:42.400
 is that you will then become more comfortable

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:46.720
 at cold temperatures away from the deliberate cold exposure.

1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:49.160
 So, whereas you might have previously been the person

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:51.160
 who was always cold in the room with air conditioning

1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:54.000
 or always seeking a sweater, always wanting to bundle up,

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.040
 you will be more comfortable in those cold environments.

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:59.960
 And the reason for that is well substantiated

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:03.240
 from this study and from animal studies

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:06.240
 whereby deliberate cold exposure

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:09.520
 converts one particular kind of fat cell,

1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:11.080
 the white fat cell,

1:18:11.080 --> 1:18:15.280
 which is a very low metabolic output cell,

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:17.800
 it's basically a storage site for energy in the body,

1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:21.240
 fat cells to a different type of fat cell,

1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:24.400
 which is the beige fat cell called beige

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:26.980
 because it's actually beige or slightly brown

1:18:26.980 --> 1:18:30.440
 under the microscope, or even to brown fat cells,

1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.420
 which are very dark under the microscope

1:18:32.420 --> 1:18:35.040
 and dark because they contain mitochondria

1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:40.500
 and are very metabolically and thermogenically active.

1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:43.860
 In other words, white fat doesn't burn many calories,

1:18:43.860 --> 1:18:45.520
 it's basically a storage site,

1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:47.600
 it's a bank account for energy,

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:52.240
 it's filled with lipids and those lipids can be used

1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:53.480
 if the body needs energy

1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:55.680
 and if it goes into a caloric deficit.

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:59.680
 Beige fat and brown fat acts as sort of a furnace

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:03.400
 or the sort of fat that you would find in a candle,

1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:06.080
 a fuel that can increase core body temperature.

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:09.520
 So beige fat and brown fat is very good

1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:13.320
 at raising our metabolism and helps burn white fat.

1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:16.400
 Now, of course, it does that only in the context

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:18.340
 of a caloric deficit,

1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:21.960
 but it can actually help create that caloric deficit.

1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:24.560
 Having more beige fat and brown fat

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:27.320
 can increase your overall core metabolism.

1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:29.040
 In other words, the number of calories

1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:31.700
 that you burn per day and therefore the number of calories

1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:34.700
 that you need to either maintain or to lose weight.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.240
 The simple translation of this is that getting

1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:43.040
 into cold water for a total of 11 minutes, perhaps more,

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:45.000
 but at least 11 minutes per week,

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.720
 divided into two or four sessions

1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:50.520
 can increase your core metabolism in part

1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:54.200
 by increasing your beige and brown fat stores.

1:19:54.200 --> 1:19:57.400
 And we know how that works, at least in animal models.

1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:59.280
 And there's now reason to suspect

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.320
 that the exact same mechanisms are occurring in humans.

1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:05.340
 The primary way in which deliberate cold exposure

1:20:05.340 --> 1:20:08.480
 converts white fat cells into these more metabolically,

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:12.120
 thermogenically active metabolism increasing beige

1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:17.120
 and brown fat cells is because norepinephrine

1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:20.920
 released when we get into the cold,

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:25.000
 binds to receptors on the surface of white fat cells

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:30.000
 and activates downstream pathways such as UCP1.

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.640
 So this is an uncoupling protein one

1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:35.520
 that acts on the mitochondrial metabolism of cells

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:39.060
 and increases the mitochondrial output of those cells

1:20:39.060 --> 1:20:41.360
 and the mitochondrial density of those cells.

1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:44.840
 In other words, it takes a cell that has a kind

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:48.880
 of a weak engine or no engine for generating energy,

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:51.040
 although every cell has some mitochondria,

1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:53.600
 it takes cells that have very few mitochondria

1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:56.320
 and increases the engine size.

1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:59.960
 It kind of stokes the furnace of those particular cells

1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:03.480
 and actually can change gene expression in those cells.

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:04.640
 So that's what's really interesting.

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:08.420
 Deliberate cold exposure causes increases in norepinephrine,

1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:12.680
 which bind to receptors on the surfaces of white fat cells,

1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:16.320
 which triggers the release of things like UCP1.

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:19.680
 It also causes the release of things like PPAR gamma

1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:22.040
 and cofactor PGC1.

1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:23.540
 I'm going to refer you to a review

1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:25.440
 if you want to learn more about these.

1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:26.840
 For those of you that don't want to learn more,

1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:29.600
 all you need to know is that the downstream of all that

1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:32.400
 are increases in mitochondria and metabolism

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:36.240
 and actual genetic changes in the white fat cells

1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:39.480
 that convert them into beige and brown fat cells.

1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:41.400
 This is especially important for adults

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:44.740
 because babies and young children

1:21:44.740 --> 1:21:47.760
 actually don't have the ability to shiver

1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:51.540
 or they have a less robust capacity to shiver.

1:21:51.540 --> 1:21:53.440
 Very small babies really can't shiver,

1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:56.440
 so they have a lot of brown fat in order to keep them warm.

1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:00.360
 Young children eventually develop the ability to shiver

1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:02.920
 and maintain these brown fat stores,

1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:05.960
 mainly around the clavicles, the heart, the upper spine,

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:07.660
 and in the upper back.

1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:10.840
 And it's no coincidence that kids can often run around

1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:11.880
 with a minimal of clothing

1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:13.120
 and be comfortable in environments

1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:15.240
 that adults would be cold in.

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:21.000
 As life goes on, we tend to lose beige and brown fat,

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.680
 but this mechanism that I'm referring to

1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:25.640
 points to the plasticity of white fat,

1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:27.040
 meaning the ability for white fat

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:28.580
 to actually convert its identity

1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:30.960
 into this metabolically thermogenically

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:33.900
 enhancing form of beige and brown fat.

1:22:33.900 --> 1:22:36.520
 So deliberate cold exposure is a terrific way

1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:38.440
 to increase your core metabolism.

1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:39.880
 And oftentimes critics will say,

1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:42.540
 well, the increase in metabolism isn't that significant,

1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:44.440
 although I do want to point out again,

1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:49.440
 the 93% and the 350% increases in metabolism

1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:51.040
 from that previous study.

1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:53.180
 But critics then will say,

1:22:53.180 --> 1:22:56.680
 well, that doesn't really translate to that big

1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:00.960
 of a caloric burn during the deliberate cold exposure.

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:02.680
 But to that, you should say, ah,

1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:04.840
 but that's only limiting your optics

1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:06.280
 to just a portion of the effects

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:07.780
 of deliberate cold exposure,

1:23:07.780 --> 1:23:09.080
 because deliberate cold exposure

1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:12.820
 can also convert white fat to beige fat and brown fat

1:23:12.820 --> 1:23:17.000
 and lead to these more lasting increases in metabolism.

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.680
 So for any of you interested in increasing your metabolism

1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:22.480
 and or being comfortable in cold environments

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:24.400
 and or being comfortable

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:27.500
 in terms of being able to combat stress mentally,

1:23:27.500 --> 1:23:30.960
 deliberate cold exposure, I do believe is a powerful tool.

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:33.560
 And there is simply no reason why you couldn't

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.800
 and shouldn't use the same protocols

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:38.520
 that I described earlier for building resilience

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:39.920
 to increase metabolism.

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:43.400
 Provided you're hitting that 11 minute per week threshold,

1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:46.160
 you ought to be stimulating both mechanisms,

1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:51.160
 increases in resilience and increases in core metabolism.

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:53.820
 As I mentioned earlier, most of the detailed studies

1:23:53.820 --> 1:23:57.080
 on the conversion of white fat to beige fat and brown fat

1:23:57.080 --> 1:23:59.520
 through the use of cold have been done in animal models,

1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:01.480
 but the human data are starting to emerge.

1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:04.200
 And if you'd like to do the deep dive into these mechanisms,

1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:07.220
 things like UCP-1, PPAR-gamma, et cetera,

1:24:07.220 --> 1:24:09.640
 there's a beautiful review that was published recently

1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:10.600
 in the journal Cell,

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:12.120
 which is one of the three apex journals,

1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:13.680
 Nature Science Cell.

1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:15.400
 And the title of that paper

1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:18.140
 is Adipose Tissue Plasticity in Health and Disease.

1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:19.440
 I love this review.

1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:22.780
 It has beautiful diagrams detailing all of the pathways

1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:26.460
 from cold to norepinephrine through UCP-1,

1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:28.200
 downstream of things like cyclic AMP.

1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:30.240
 If none of those names mean anything to you,

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:31.080
 don't worry about it.

1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:32.840
 You certainly don't need to know these mechanisms

1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:35.760
 to benefit from deliberate cold exposure protocols.

1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:38.140
 If those names do mean something to you,

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:41.160
 or you're interested in exploring the downstream effects

1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.400
 of deliberate cold exposure,

1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:44.200
 and something else that's really nice

1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:45.600
 that's covered in this paper

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:48.040
 is how deliberate cold exposure interacts

1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:51.720
 with fasted states and fed states.

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:54.280
 I think you'll also find this review very interesting.

1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:56.320
 I don't want to go too deeply into fasted states

1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:58.080
 and fed states right now.

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:00.440
 Suffice to say that when we are fasted,

1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:03.020
 meaning when we haven't eaten for some period of time,

1:25:03.020 --> 1:25:07.100
 our baseline levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine

1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:08.960
 are already elevated.

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.360
 And so cold exposure at those times

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:13.880
 ought to have an even greater effect

1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:16.460
 on metabolism and resilience and so on.

1:25:16.460 --> 1:25:20.400
 So for you fasters or your intermittent fasters out there,

1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:21.860
 if you really want to get fancy,

1:25:21.860 --> 1:25:24.120
 you can do your deliberate cold exposure

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:25.560
 when you are fasted.

1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:27.120
 I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it

1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:29.460
 with a very full stomach in any case.

1:25:29.460 --> 1:25:32.960
 And as I mentioned before on this podcast,

1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:36.200
 intermittent fasting is but one way,

1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:37.520
 and certainly there are other ways

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:39.660
 to limit total caloric intake

1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:41.580
 for sake of maintaining or losing weight,

1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:43.120
 if that's your goal.

1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:45.480
 I know many people are using and benefit

1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:47.400
 from intermittent fasting, however,

1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:49.660
 and so it certainly can be combined

1:25:49.660 --> 1:25:51.160
 with deliberate cold exposures

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:53.000
 in order to get even greater increases

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.860
 in norepinephrine and epinephrine.

1:25:54.860 --> 1:25:57.100
 So for those of you that are primarily interested

1:25:57.100 --> 1:25:58.560
 in using deliberate cold exposure

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:02.220
 to increase dopamine levels in your brain and body,

1:26:02.220 --> 1:26:04.520
 you can also do a combined protocol

1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:09.140
 whereby you ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes

1:26:09.140 --> 1:26:11.720
 before the deliberate cold exposure.

1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:14.660
 This is based on a study that I've talked about before

1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:18.360
 entitled Caffeine Increases Striatal Dopamine D2D3

1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:20.400
 Receptor Availability in the Human Brain.

1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:23.760
 And as the title suggests, this study was done on humans.

1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.560
 Looking at the density and or efficacy

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.840
 of these dopamine receptors in an area of the brain

1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:32.500
 called the striatum, which is involved in planning and action

1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:34.320
 and also suppressing planning and action.

1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:37.580
 It's involved very closely with whether or not

1:26:37.580 --> 1:26:41.080
 we can engage in behavior and withhold behavior,

1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:44.240
 the so-called go and no-go pathways in the brain.

1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:45.840
 Dopamine plays a critical role in that

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:48.360
 and many other things as well, as you now know.

1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:52.640
 So why would you want to ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:55.020
 before deliberate cold exposure?

1:26:55.020 --> 1:26:57.760
 Well, as I talked about earlier,

1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:00.260
 dopamine can increase quite substantially

1:27:00.260 --> 1:27:02.160
 in response to deliberate cold exposure,

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:04.000
 but dopamine on its own doesn't do anything.

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:05.960
 It has to bind to receptors.

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:08.680
 And this paper shows quite definitively

1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:10.320
 that ingesting caffeine, in this case,

1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:12.360
 it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine,

1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:14.160
 which is about the dose of caffeine

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:15.440
 in two or three cups of coffee.

1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:17.560
 It depends on the strength of the coffee, of course,

1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.800
 but it's not an outrageous amount of caffeine.

1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:23.800
 That increases the density and or efficacy

1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:24.640
 of these receptors,

1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:28.820
 which would allow that dopamine to have its greatest effect.

1:27:28.820 --> 1:27:31.120
 And for those of you that want to get really, really fancy,

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:32.580
 I suppose you could do this fasted.

1:27:32.580 --> 1:27:35.000
 So you get the further increase in norepinephrine,

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.200
 then you get the dopamine increase from the cold exposure,

1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:38.880
 the binding of the dopamine.

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:42.120
 Although I do want to point out that at some point

1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:44.080
 you start layering together enough protocols

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.680
 that you would be spending your entire day

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:47.080
 trying to get this dopamine pulse.

1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:49.560
 And I would hope that you would have other activities

1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:50.780
 that you would engage in.

1:27:50.780 --> 1:27:53.760
 But if you're getting up in the morning and you're fasted

1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:55.040
 because you haven't eaten all night

1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:56.140
 and you have a cup of coffee,

1:27:56.140 --> 1:27:59.160
 and then 60 minutes later you take your cold shower,

1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:01.820
 or two hours later you do your cold immersion

1:28:01.820 --> 1:28:02.880
 or your cold shower,

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:05.840
 you would be layering together these different mechanisms

1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:07.940
 of dopamine receptors, epinephrine, and so forth

1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:11.240
 in a way that at least to me doesn't seem incompatible

1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:12.440
 with having some other life,

1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:15.040
 like going to school and having relationships, et cetera.

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:16.720
 And this increase in dopamine,

1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:20.740
 particularly in the striatum, is not a trivial one.

1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:23.160
 I do want to point out, as the authors do,

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:24.860
 that preclinical studies have shown

1:28:24.860 --> 1:28:27.340
 that increases in striatal dopamine

1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:29.400
 induced by things like modafinil,

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.280
 which is used to treat ADHD and treat narcolepsy,

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:36.120
 is necessary for their wake promoting actions.

1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:37.400
 What this really says is that

1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:39.800
 just having elevated levels of dopamine from a drug

1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:42.300
 or from an ice bath or what have you

1:28:42.300 --> 1:28:44.560
 is not sufficient to get the effects of dopamine.

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:47.400
 You really need the receptors to be available,

1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:49.040
 and you need those receptors to be available

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:50.440
 in the appropriate density,

1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:52.560
 and you need those receptors to be available

1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:55.320
 in the appropriate density in the striatum in particular.

1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:57.500
 So I think there are a number of reasons why,

1:28:57.500 --> 1:29:00.560
 if it's compatible with the other aspects of your health,

1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:02.280
 because of course always you have to consider this

1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:03.920
 on a background of cardiovascular health

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:05.160
 and blood pressure, et cetera,

1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:07.240
 that ingesting a cup or two of coffee

1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:11.240
 an hour before your ice bath, maybe fasted as well,

1:29:11.240 --> 1:29:13.520
 could be quite beneficial for increasing dopamine

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:15.640
 over quite extended periods of time.

1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:18.380
 A couple of key points that you'll want to pay attention to

1:29:18.380 --> 1:29:21.280
 in thinking about deliberate cold exposure and metabolism.

1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:25.240
 In the Soberg study, they also explored the use of sauna

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.960
 and how to use sauna, meaning deliberate heat,

1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:30.400
 in conjunction with cold.

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:32.240
 We are going to do an entire episode

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:34.640
 about the use of heat for health and performance.

1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:37.160
 So that is not the focus now.

1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:40.160
 However, it does raise an important point

1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:42.120
 that we do need to address at this moment,

1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:44.960
 which is if you are using sauna

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:47.320
 or if you are taking warm showers,

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:50.040
 or if you're simply using deliberate cold exposure

1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:54.000
 of any kind, should you get into the heat afterward

1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:55.840
 or before or not at all?

1:29:55.840 --> 1:29:58.440
 And this is where we can point

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:00.680
 to the so-called Soberg principle,

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:02.320
 at least I call it the Soberg principle.

1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:04.240
 The Soberg principle named after first author

1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:08.060
 of this study I referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna Soberg.

1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:12.940
 In science, it is appropriate to take a key piece of data

1:30:12.940 --> 1:30:14.460
 and call it a principle,

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:16.500
 if in fact it translates to something larger,

1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.140
 which I believe it does.

1:30:18.140 --> 1:30:20.020
 It is generally not appropriate

1:30:20.020 --> 1:30:21.940
 for people to name a principle after themselves,

1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:25.380
 although there are a few scientists that have done that.

1:30:25.380 --> 1:30:27.020
 So I have named it the Soberg principle,

1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:30.260
 but I did that to give it appropriate credit

1:30:30.260 --> 1:30:33.740
 to Dr. Susanna Soberg, who discovered that

1:30:33.740 --> 1:30:36.240
 and pointed out quite appropriately

1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:40.380
 that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolism

1:30:40.380 --> 1:30:42.720
 through deliberate cold exposure,

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:47.460
 you want to force yourself to reheat on your own

1:30:47.460 --> 1:30:49.240
 after the deliberate cold exposure,

1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:51.060
 meaning you wouldn't want to go

1:30:51.060 --> 1:30:53.380
 from the cold shower to a hot shower

1:30:53.380 --> 1:30:54.820
 or from the cold shower to a sauna.

1:30:54.820 --> 1:30:57.140
 Rather, if you were going to start with a hot shower

1:30:57.140 --> 1:30:58.720
 or you're going to start with a sauna,

1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:00.980
 that you would end with the cold

1:31:00.980 --> 1:31:03.780
 and then you would reheat naturally.

1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:06.100
 Now, I personally take a cold shower

1:31:06.100 --> 1:31:08.300
 a few times a week or do cold immersion.

1:31:08.300 --> 1:31:10.700
 And because I'm not specifically focused

1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:13.900
 on increasing metabolism, although I probably should be,

1:31:13.900 --> 1:31:16.440
 that's not what I'm using it for now,

1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:18.060
 I will take a hot shower afterwards.

1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:19.880
 And in doing so, I'm short-circuiting

1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:21.820
 some of the further metabolic increases

1:31:21.820 --> 1:31:25.180
 that I would achieve were I to just end with the cold.

1:31:25.180 --> 1:31:27.700
 So the Soberg principle is

1:31:27.700 --> 1:31:31.520
 if you want to increase your metabolism, end with cold.

1:31:31.520 --> 1:31:34.580
 And we can take this a step further and say

1:31:34.580 --> 1:31:36.980
 that if you want to use deliberate cold exposure

1:31:36.980 --> 1:31:40.940
 to increase metabolism, that you should make sure

1:31:40.940 --> 1:31:43.620
 that you get to the point where you shiver.

1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:44.980
 And the reason for this is that

1:31:44.980 --> 1:31:47.080
 there are a series of studies, but in particular,

1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:48.960
 one study published in the journal Nature,

1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:51.740
 excellent journal in the year 2018,

1:31:51.740 --> 1:31:55.700
 showing that deliberate cold exposure

1:31:55.700 --> 1:31:59.160
 that evokes shivering from the muscles

1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:02.080
 causes the release of a molecule called succinate

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:06.140
 from the muscles, and that succinate plays a key role

1:32:06.140 --> 1:32:08.820
 in activating brown fat thermogenesis,

1:32:08.820 --> 1:32:10.940
 which you now have heard about and understand

1:32:10.940 --> 1:32:13.100
 as critical to the increases in metabolism

1:32:13.100 --> 1:32:15.860
 caused by deliberate cold exposure.

1:32:15.860 --> 1:32:17.500
 So what this means is if you want to increase

1:32:17.500 --> 1:32:20.260
 your metabolism, end on cold, that's the Soberg principle,

1:32:20.260 --> 1:32:23.160
 and as best you can, try and get to the point

1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:25.940
 where you are shivering either when you are

1:32:25.940 --> 1:32:29.240
 in the cold exposure or immediately afterwards.

1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:32.580
 Now, one efficient way to do this is to, for instance,

1:32:32.580 --> 1:32:35.340
 you could get into the cold shower

1:32:35.340 --> 1:32:37.500
 for a minute or two minutes or three minutes,

1:32:37.500 --> 1:32:40.060
 uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in.

1:32:40.060 --> 1:32:42.260
 Remember, that's our general rule of thumb.

1:32:42.260 --> 1:32:45.420
 Then turn off the water and stand there,

1:32:45.420 --> 1:32:47.820
 make sure that you're not holding yourself

1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:49.700
 close to your body, you're not hugging yourself

1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:50.760
 to try and keep yourself warm,

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:53.900
 but rather your limbs are extended at your sides.

1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:56.860
 And then if that fails to induce shiver,

1:32:56.860 --> 1:32:59.660
 then to turn on the cold water again

1:32:59.660 --> 1:33:00.920
 and then turn it off again.

1:33:00.920 --> 1:33:03.020
 So alternating perhaps a minute to three minutes

1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:05.520
 of cold exposure followed by a minute to three minutes

1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:08.380
 of drying out in air and going back

1:33:08.380 --> 1:33:10.620
 into the cold exposure, et cetera.

1:33:10.620 --> 1:33:12.140
 I can tell you this from experience,

1:33:12.140 --> 1:33:14.100
 this is a pretty brutal protocol.

1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:18.700
 If you have never tried getting into an ice bath

1:33:18.700 --> 1:33:21.580
 or cold water immersion or cold shower for one minute

1:33:21.580 --> 1:33:23.340
 and then getting out and trying to stand there

1:33:23.340 --> 1:33:26.080
 with your arms extended in cool or cold air

1:33:26.080 --> 1:33:28.780
 for one minute and then getting back into the cold shower

1:33:28.780 --> 1:33:32.420
 or water immersion, you are in for an experience

1:33:32.420 --> 1:33:34.260
 because even for those of you

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:36.060
 that are pretty shiver resistant,

1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:38.240
 you will find that it is much, much harder

1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:41.880
 to get out of that cold water and stand their arms extended

1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:43.780
 and drying off by evaporation,

1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:46.580
 which further draws heat from the body

1:33:46.580 --> 1:33:48.260
 than it is to wrap yourself in a towel,

1:33:48.260 --> 1:33:50.180
 get in a warm shower or a sauna.

1:33:50.180 --> 1:33:54.060
 So there's certainly no requirement to end on cold.

1:33:54.060 --> 1:33:57.620
 There's certainly no requirement to induce shiver,

1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:01.740
 but if your primary goal is to induce increases

1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:05.140
 in metabolism, both in the short-term and in the long-term

1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:06.660
 following the cold exposure,

1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:07.980
 well, then you'll want to end on cold

1:34:07.980 --> 1:34:10.540
 and you'll want to find a way to shiver

1:34:10.540 --> 1:34:12.780
 provided that the level of cold

1:34:12.780 --> 1:34:14.100
 that you're exposing yourself to

1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:15.860
 is still safe for you overall.

1:34:15.860 --> 1:34:17.100
 So up until now, I've been talking

1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:20.020
 about deliberate cold exposure as a potent stimulus

1:34:20.020 --> 1:34:22.820
 for the release of norepinephrine in the brain and body.

1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:25.820
 And indeed it is, but the way I've been describing it

1:34:26.700 --> 1:34:30.740
 has been in the context of circulating plasma levels

1:34:30.740 --> 1:34:33.640
 of norepinephrine, meaning circulating within the blood.

1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:37.660
 What I haven't mentioned, but is absolutely true

1:34:37.660 --> 1:34:41.700
 is that the fat cells themselves

1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:44.700
 actually receive input from neurons.

1:34:44.700 --> 1:34:47.500
 So there are neurons that release norepinephrine

1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:51.060
 in response to cold directly into the fat.

1:34:51.060 --> 1:34:53.440
 So I want to give you this picture

1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:55.820
 of how the architecture of all this works

1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:57.980
 because I think it can help you navigate

1:34:57.980 --> 1:35:01.780
 and indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols.

1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:05.300
 Your adrenal glands release norepinephrine and epinephrine.

1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:08.900
 Your brain has sites within it like the locus coeruleus

1:35:08.900 --> 1:35:12.020
 that release norepinephrine and epinephrine.

1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.620
 But there are also neurons within your skin

1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:17.260
 that sense cold and other neurons

1:35:17.260 --> 1:35:19.380
 that can directly release norepinephrine

1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:22.640
 into the fat stores and cause those white fat cells

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.420
 to convert to beige and brown fat.

1:35:24.420 --> 1:35:26.920
 And I think this particular aspect of our physiology

1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:29.700
 is often overlooked in studies.

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:31.140
 And when people say, oh, well,

1:35:31.140 --> 1:35:33.600
 the increases in metabolism aren't that great,

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.340
 the circulating levels of norepinephrine,

1:35:35.340 --> 1:35:39.180
 those are very large, but they're very transient and so on,

1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:42.960
 that fails to understand that neurons

1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:45.620
 that actually sense cold are in a position

1:35:45.620 --> 1:35:48.500
 to communicate via other neurons

1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:49.940
 directly to the fat cells

1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:51.860
 and release norepinephrine into those fat cells,

1:35:51.860 --> 1:35:53.540
 which as I pointed out earlier,

1:35:53.540 --> 1:35:56.820
 set off a huge set of immediate and long-term cascades

1:35:56.820 --> 1:35:58.880
 of even gene expression changes.

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:02.040
 So the picture that I'd like you to have in your mind

1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.140
 is that when you get into the cold,

1:36:04.140 --> 1:36:07.760
 yes, of course you experience that as a experience of,

1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:09.540
 I don't want to do this, I'm going to overcome this,

1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:11.300
 I'm going to climb over these mental walls

1:36:11.300 --> 1:36:14.020
 that represent adrenaline release in my brain and body,

1:36:14.020 --> 1:36:17.940
 but also that your fat cells are receiving signals,

1:36:17.940 --> 1:36:21.020
 norepinephrine signals that are changing those fat cells

1:36:21.020 --> 1:36:22.860
 and the way that they metabolize energy.

1:36:22.860 --> 1:36:24.180
 Now I'd like to shift our attention

1:36:24.180 --> 1:36:26.260
 to the use of deliberate cold exposure

1:36:26.260 --> 1:36:28.740
 for sake of physical performance.

1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:30.400
 And there are a lot of opinions out there

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:32.440
 about the use of deliberate cold,

1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:33.980
 whether or not it should be done, for instance,

1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:36.180
 before or after exercise,

1:36:36.180 --> 1:36:39.700
 whether or not if done immediately after strength training

1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:40.800
 or hypertrophy training,

1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:43.460
 meaning training designed to grow muscles

1:36:43.460 --> 1:36:44.340
 or make them stronger,

1:36:44.340 --> 1:36:46.140
 whether or not it can inhibit that process

1:36:46.140 --> 1:36:47.600
 and so on and so forth.

1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:50.640
 I think today in looking over the literature

1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:52.700
 and trying to bring forward the simplest

1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:53.600
 and most straightforward

1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:55.980
 and yet scientifically grounded protocols,

1:36:55.980 --> 1:36:58.060
 we can set up some general guidelines

1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:00.140
 that will allow most, if not all of you

1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:03.300
 to still extract the benefits of deliberate cold exposure

1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:06.900
 on physical performance without getting too neurotic

1:37:06.900 --> 1:37:08.380
 about the exact timing.

1:37:08.380 --> 1:37:10.660
 But for sake of discussion,

1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:13.240
 and because it's a prominent theme

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:14.860
 in many online communities,

1:37:14.860 --> 1:37:18.140
 let's just start with the big one out there,

1:37:18.140 --> 1:37:21.980
 meaning the question of whether or not doing an ice bath

1:37:21.980 --> 1:37:23.660
 or doing deliberate cold exposure

1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:26.140
 or taking a cold shower after strength

1:37:26.140 --> 1:37:28.260
 slash hypertrophy training,

1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:30.660
 meaning training designed to increase strength

1:37:30.660 --> 1:37:34.120
 and or I should say the size of muscles

1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:37.800
 will somehow short circuit or diminish that process,

1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:39.340
 whether or not it will reduce

1:37:39.340 --> 1:37:42.100
 or eliminate those strength gains and hypertrophy gains.

1:37:42.100 --> 1:37:45.060
 And the short answer that I was able to arrive at

1:37:45.060 --> 1:37:47.500
 on the basis of a review article

1:37:47.500 --> 1:37:48.980
 that I'll talk about in a moment

1:37:48.980 --> 1:37:51.140
 and some other studies as well

1:37:51.140 --> 1:37:56.140
 is that if your main goal is hypertrophy and strength,

1:37:56.300 --> 1:38:00.460
 it is probably best to avoid cold water immersion

1:38:00.460 --> 1:38:04.340
 and ice bath immersion in the four hours

1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:06.860
 immediately following that strength

1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.660
 and or hypertrophy training.

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:12.860
 Again, if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophy

1:38:12.860 --> 1:38:15.900
 or strength or some combination of those,

1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:20.140
 probably best to avoid cold water immersion up to the neck

1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:23.020
 or ice bath immersion up to the neck

1:38:23.020 --> 1:38:26.100
 immediately after strength and hypertrophy training

1:38:26.100 --> 1:38:30.100
 and extending out to about four hours after that training.

1:38:31.100 --> 1:38:32.940
 If you're really neurotic about this,

1:38:32.940 --> 1:38:35.480
 then perhaps you'd want to move the cold water exposure

1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.140
 to a different day entirely,

1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:39.800
 but it all depends on how neurotically attached you are

1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:42.380
 to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy.

1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:44.060
 And if that's your goal, terrific,

1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:47.160
 well then probably moving the cold exposure

1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:49.040
 four hours or more away from that training

1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:50.700
 is going to be necessary for you.

1:38:50.700 --> 1:38:53.700
 Now you'll notice I did not talk about cold showers.

1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:55.820
 And the reason I did not talk about cold showers

1:38:55.820 --> 1:38:59.340
 is that there simply are not very many studies

1:38:59.340 --> 1:39:01.940
 of deliberate cold exposure through cold showers

1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:03.040
 for the reasons I talked about

1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:05.100
 at the beginning of the episode.

1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:08.380
 It's hard for me to imagine that taking a brief cold shower

1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:11.020
 after a strength or hypertrophy training session

1:39:11.020 --> 1:39:13.260
 would completely reverse or short circuit

1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:15.480
 the effects of that strength and hypertrophy training.

1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:17.860
 But again, if you're neurotically attached

1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:21.100
 to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy

1:39:21.100 --> 1:39:22.580
 out of your training sessions,

1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:24.800
 then by all means, err on the side of caution

1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:27.460
 and wait four hours or more to do your cold shower

1:39:27.460 --> 1:39:29.880
 just as you would wait four hours or more

1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:31.580
 to do your cold water immersion.

1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:33.900
 Now there are nice data pointed to the fact

1:39:33.900 --> 1:39:37.540
 that doing cold water immersion after a hard run,

1:39:37.540 --> 1:39:41.660
 so endurance training, or even sprint and interval training,

1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:45.660
 or after a weight workout where your main focus

1:39:45.660 --> 1:39:47.500
 is on performance of those movements,

1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:49.180
 or after a skill training workout

1:39:49.180 --> 1:39:52.260
 where your main focus on performance of those movements,

1:39:52.260 --> 1:39:54.200
 that there's no reason to think

1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:57.380
 that that cold water immersion or ice bath or cold shower

1:39:57.380 --> 1:40:01.540
 would inhibit the progress or the stimulus

1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:03.820
 that would lead to progress that occurred

1:40:03.820 --> 1:40:05.260
 during that training session.

1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:07.460
 In other words, I don't see any reason

1:40:07.460 --> 1:40:10.560
 based on the literature to avoid deliberate cold exposure

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:12.060
 immediately after training,

1:40:12.060 --> 1:40:15.900
 again, unless your goal is hypertrophy and strength.

1:40:15.900 --> 1:40:17.340
 And in fact, there's a very nice review

1:40:17.340 --> 1:40:21.580
 that was recently published on deliberate cold exposure

1:40:21.580 --> 1:40:24.720
 and how it can impact physical performance,

1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:27.740
 whether or not it's done before or after

1:40:27.740 --> 1:40:30.260
 different types of training and so forth.

1:40:30.260 --> 1:40:33.500
 The paper is entitled impact of cold water immersion

1:40:33.500 --> 1:40:35.260
 compared with passive recovery

1:40:35.260 --> 1:40:37.780
 following a single bout of strenuous exercise

1:40:37.780 --> 1:40:41.300
 on athletic performance in physically active participants,

1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:45.080
 a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression.

1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:49.540
 So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studies

1:40:49.540 --> 1:40:51.900
 that looked at a tremendous number of variables

1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:54.300
 and contexts as you would expect

1:40:54.300 --> 1:40:56.820
 in a meta-analysis of 52 studies.

1:40:56.820 --> 1:40:58.640
 I'm going to read you the conclusions of the study

1:40:58.640 --> 1:40:59.880
 and I'll provide a link.

1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:00.900
 We certainly don't have the time

1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:02.700
 to go through all the details of the study.

1:41:02.700 --> 1:41:05.120
 I will highlight a few specific outcomes

1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:07.060
 that I found particularly interesting,

1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:10.380
 but here I am paraphrasing their conclusions

1:41:10.380 --> 1:41:13.420
 that cold water immersion,

1:41:13.420 --> 1:41:16.460
 I want to emphasize immersion, not cold showers,

1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.080
 but cold water immersion,

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:20.040
 they say was an effective recovery tool

1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:22.300
 after high intensity exercise.

1:41:22.300 --> 1:41:23.860
 They observed positive outcomes,

1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:27.360
 meaning improvements in certain variables

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:30.260
 for muscular power, muscular soreness,

1:41:30.260 --> 1:41:33.300
 meaning reduced muscular soreness, increased muscular power,

1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:36.720
 perceived recovery after 24 hours of exercise.

1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:39.340
 However, there were certain forms of exercise

1:41:39.340 --> 1:41:43.320
 that were not benefited by cold water immersion,

1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:45.800
 such as eccentric exercise,

1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:49.220
 exercise focusing only on the lowering component

1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:51.020
 or the so-called eccentric component

1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:52.700
 of resistance exercise.

1:41:52.700 --> 1:41:56.620
 They saw some very interesting dose response relationships

1:41:56.620 --> 1:41:58.400
 for things like endurance training,

1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:01.720
 meaning the longer the cold exposure

1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:02.780
 post-endurance training,

1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.300
 the more improvement in endurance performance,

1:42:05.300 --> 1:42:08.740
 reductions in circulating creatine kinases

1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:11.260
 and things that relate to muscle damage

1:42:11.260 --> 1:42:13.100
 under certain conditions.

1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:14.240
 At some point in the future, by the way,

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:16.260
 we'll do an entire episode on creatine

1:42:16.260 --> 1:42:17.220
 and creatine kinases,

1:42:17.220 --> 1:42:19.700
 which are important not just for muscular function,

1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:21.580
 but also for brain function.

1:42:21.580 --> 1:42:25.300
 But the basic takeaway was that cold water immersion

1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:27.700
 performed after high-intensity exercise

1:42:27.700 --> 1:42:30.740
 was beneficial from a number of different standpoints

1:42:30.740 --> 1:42:35.740
 and indicated that shorter duration cold exposure

1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:38.500
 and lower temperatures can improve

1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:40.540
 the efficacy of cold water exposure

1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:42.940
 if used after high-intensity exercise, okay?

1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:45.400
 There I'm directly pulling from their conclusions.

1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:47.860
 So what this says is that it's not just those

1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:52.420
 longer duration 30, 45-minute and 60-minute protocols

1:42:52.420 --> 1:42:54.860
 of cold water immersion that we discussed earlier,

1:42:54.860 --> 1:42:58.100
 but also shorter duration, one-minute, three-minute,

1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:02.460
 five-minute exposures to lower temperatures,

1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:04.740
 temperatures that would make you psychologically

1:43:04.740 --> 1:43:07.700
 want to get out as soon as you possibly can,

1:43:07.700 --> 1:43:09.980
 but again, that you can safely stay in,

1:43:09.980 --> 1:43:12.640
 done after training really have been shown

1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:15.940
 to improve outcomes in terms of reducing soreness

1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:18.700
 and improving training efficacy,

1:43:18.700 --> 1:43:22.460
 meaning your ability to get back into training more quickly

1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:26.620
 and thereby deliver more training stimuli to a given muscle

1:43:26.620 --> 1:43:29.060
 or in your endurance training protocol.

1:43:29.060 --> 1:43:30.800
 Translating to English, what this means is that

1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:33.620
 taking a cold shower or getting into an ice bath

1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:35.760
 or some other form of cold water immersion

1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:37.100
 within the immediate minutes

1:43:37.100 --> 1:43:40.300
 or even the immediate hours following your training

1:43:40.300 --> 1:43:41.900
 has been shown to be beneficial.

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:45.820
 I'm sure a number of you have questions, for instance,

1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:49.020
 how long should you be in that cold exposure?

1:43:49.020 --> 1:43:51.160
 Is it the same as the 11-minute threshold

1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:52.700
 described earlier?

1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:55.720
 To be honest with you, there are not enough studies

1:43:55.720 --> 1:43:58.180
 to really point to the critical threshold

1:43:58.180 --> 1:44:01.800
 for eliminating or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:04.480
 or for getting maximal results

1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:06.560
 from power and endurance training,

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:09.220
 but this study does make a couple of key points,

1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:11.180
 and here I will just paraphrase.

1:44:11.180 --> 1:44:15.180
 For instance, that cold water immersion is more likely

1:44:15.180 --> 1:44:18.660
 to positively influence muscular power performance,

1:44:18.660 --> 1:44:22.700
 to reduce muscle soreness, to reduce serum creatine kinase,

1:44:22.700 --> 1:44:24.920
 and to improve perceived recovery

1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:26.780
 after high-intensity exercise

1:44:26.780 --> 1:44:29.260
 as compared with passive recovery.

1:44:29.260 --> 1:44:32.260
 This can be translated to cold water exposure

1:44:32.260 --> 1:44:35.420
 after training is beneficial and probably better

1:44:35.420 --> 1:44:38.640
 than passive recovery from a number of standpoints.

1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:42.020
 In addition, they say that dose-response relationships,

1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:47.100
 meaning the amount and the degree of cold

1:44:47.100 --> 1:44:49.940
 that people were exposed to and how often they did that,

1:44:51.220 --> 1:44:53.740
 in particular in lower temperature cold immersion,

1:44:53.740 --> 1:44:57.020
 so these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols

1:44:57.020 --> 1:44:59.040
 that are one minute or two minutes,

1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:00.820
 three minutes, maybe five minutes,

1:45:00.820 --> 1:45:02.780
 but that one couldn't stay in there longer

1:45:02.780 --> 1:45:05.580
 because it feels stressful and one wants to get out,

1:45:05.580 --> 1:45:08.240
 may be more effective after high-intensity exercise

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:11.380
 for removal of serum creatine kinase,

1:45:11.380 --> 1:45:13.420
 as well that these shorter duration

1:45:13.420 --> 1:45:16.100
 cold water immersion approaches may be more effective

1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:19.820
 after high-intensity endurance performance as well.

1:45:19.820 --> 1:45:22.260
 So all of this can be translated to say

1:45:22.260 --> 1:45:27.140
 that unless your main goal is hypertrophy and strength,

1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:31.060
 that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion

1:45:31.060 --> 1:45:32.540
 in cold water or ice bath,

1:45:32.540 --> 1:45:34.220
 but if you don't have access to that,

1:45:34.220 --> 1:45:37.180
 then cold showers is likely going to be beneficial

1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:40.740
 if done immediately after or in the minutes or hours

1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:44.260
 after your training, especially high-intensity training.

1:45:44.260 --> 1:45:46.540
 One particularly nice thing about this meta-analysis

1:45:46.540 --> 1:45:48.180
 is that it included some studies

1:45:48.180 --> 1:45:50.740
 that involved the use of cooling packs,

1:45:50.740 --> 1:45:55.400
 so again, vests that can hold essentially ice packs

1:45:55.400 --> 1:45:59.000
 and indeed even cryotherapy chambers and so on.

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.340
 There's a nice table in the study

1:46:00.340 --> 1:46:01.860
 if you want to get really detailed

1:46:01.860 --> 1:46:03.780
 and go and look specifically at those studies,

1:46:03.780 --> 1:46:04.800
 I invite you to do that.

1:46:04.800 --> 1:46:06.460
 We'll put a link to this study

1:46:06.460 --> 1:46:08.600
 in the caption for this episode.

1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:10.340
 But all in all, what this study shows

1:46:10.340 --> 1:46:14.100
 is that deliberate cold exposure can be very useful

1:46:14.100 --> 1:46:18.140
 for recovery, likely through reductions in inflammation

1:46:18.140 --> 1:46:20.660
 in muscle and connective tissue.

1:46:20.660 --> 1:46:22.900
 And while this study did not look specifically

1:46:22.900 --> 1:46:24.900
 at the mechanisms of reduced inflammation

1:46:25.860 --> 1:46:27.860
 caused by deliberate cold exposure,

1:46:27.860 --> 1:46:30.460
 those mechanisms are somewhat known.

1:46:30.460 --> 1:46:32.660
 There are a number of studies that have pointed to the fact

1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:34.840
 that deliberate cold and cold generally

1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:37.360
 can reduce inflammatory cytokines,

1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:39.520
 such as IL-6, interleukin-6.

1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:43.120
 It can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines,

1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:45.280
 such as interleukin-10 and so on.

1:46:46.260 --> 1:46:48.000
 Without getting into all those details,

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.320
 I think it's sufficient to say that if you are somebody

1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:54.260
 who experiences a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness,

1:46:54.260 --> 1:46:56.020
 taking a cold shower after your training

1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:58.340
 or getting into a cold immersion after your training,

1:46:58.340 --> 1:47:01.020
 even if it's a few hours later, ought to help.

1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:04.560
 And if you are doing particularly intense training,

1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:06.660
 then you probably want to ratchet up

1:47:06.660 --> 1:47:10.180
 the number of cold exposure sessions that you're doing,

1:47:10.180 --> 1:47:12.380
 even if those have to be done on separate days

1:47:12.380 --> 1:47:13.220
 from your training.

1:47:13.220 --> 1:47:15.860
 Because a lot of the inflammatory effects of training,

1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:16.900
 endurance and strength training,

1:47:16.900 --> 1:47:19.420
 are actually occurring some hours away

1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:20.660
 from the training stimulus.

1:47:20.660 --> 1:47:22.820
 So it's not just that inflammation goes up radically

1:47:22.820 --> 1:47:25.060
 during training, which it often can,

1:47:25.060 --> 1:47:27.220
 but that it can occur even in the days

1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:29.540
 and even weeks afterwards, depending on how intense

1:47:29.540 --> 1:47:31.300
 and how long duration that training is.

1:47:31.300 --> 1:47:33.820
 So deliberate cold exposure is very powerful

1:47:33.820 --> 1:47:36.420
 as an anti-inflammatory tool.

1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:38.540
 Now I'd like to emphasize a topic that we touched on

1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:40.380
 at the beginning of the episode,

1:47:40.380 --> 1:47:43.100
 which are those glabrous skin surfaces,

1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:45.780
 the hands, the upper face and the bottoms of the feet,

1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:50.420
 through which heat is especially good at leaving the body.

1:47:50.420 --> 1:47:53.740
 And another way of putting that is that

1:47:53.740 --> 1:47:56.580
 one can cool the body much more efficiently

1:47:56.580 --> 1:47:58.860
 through the glabrous skin surfaces.

1:47:58.860 --> 1:48:01.500
 Now, if you want to understand all of the science

1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:05.860
 behind this and all of the various applications,

1:48:05.860 --> 1:48:08.260
 I invite you to please listen to the episode that I did

1:48:08.260 --> 1:48:11.380
 with Dr. Craig Heller, again, in the biology department

1:48:11.380 --> 1:48:12.220
 at Stanford.

1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:15.560
 For sake of this episode, I'm just going to detail

1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:18.360
 a couple of findings from his laboratory.

1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:21.380
 The first one dealing with exercise-induced hyperthermia,

1:48:21.380 --> 1:48:22.780
 because I think this is very interesting

1:48:22.780 --> 1:48:24.580
 and it can even save lives

1:48:24.580 --> 1:48:26.420
 if you understand the way this works.

1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.420
 There's a particular paper that focuses on this

1:48:30.420 --> 1:48:32.300
 and we will put a link to this as well.

1:48:32.300 --> 1:48:34.160
 The title of this paper is novel application

1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:35.540
 of chemical cold packs for treatment

1:48:35.540 --> 1:48:37.460
 of exercise-induced hyperthermia,

1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:39.560
 a randomized control trial.

1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:42.160
 This is a pretty brutal study,

1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:44.820
 brutal for the subjects, that is.

1:48:44.820 --> 1:48:47.940
 What this study involved was having subjects

1:48:47.940 --> 1:48:50.960
 walk on a treadmill at a pretty significant incline,

1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:53.660
 anywhere from nine to 17%,

1:48:53.660 --> 1:48:56.260
 wearing a substantial amount of clothing

1:48:56.260 --> 1:48:58.220
 that was not well-ventilated,

1:48:58.220 --> 1:49:00.700
 and the room was kept to 40 degrees Celsius,

1:49:00.700 --> 1:49:03.180
 which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:49:03.180 --> 1:49:06.680
 This is definitely not something to do at home.

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.180
 This study was designed to induce hyperthermia,

1:49:09.180 --> 1:49:11.580
 which as I mentioned earlier, can be quite dangerous.

1:49:11.580 --> 1:49:14.520
 And they compared two types of cooling.

1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:16.180
 In the first form of cooling

1:49:16.180 --> 1:49:18.200
 that they call traditional cooling,

1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:21.500
 they had ice packs on their neck,

1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:23.880
 in their armpits and in their groin.

1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:25.500
 And in the other group,

1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:27.840
 there was the so-called glabrous skin cooling.

1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:29.580
 So the palms, the soles of the feet,

1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:30.900
 which were actually,

1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:35.440
 so they were cooling inside the boots or inside of gloves.

1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:38.160
 And on the upper portion of the face.

1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:41.220
 And the basic takeaway of this study

1:49:41.220 --> 1:49:43.240
 is that by cooling the glabrous skin,

1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:47.260
 the subjects were able to sustain this walking

1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:50.880
 on these incline treadmills for much longer

1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:54.180
 than were the people who received traditional cooling.

1:49:54.180 --> 1:49:56.380
 And also the return to baseline temperature

1:49:56.380 --> 1:49:59.820
 was much faster in the glabrous skin cooling group.

1:49:59.820 --> 1:50:01.840
 So how this translates to the real world

1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:04.040
 is that if ever you are hyperthermic

1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:05.640
 or someone else is hyperthermic,

1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:08.880
 one way to cool them down quickly

1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:13.260
 is to cool these palmar glabrous,

1:50:13.260 --> 1:50:14.520
 soles of the feet, glabrous,

1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:16.400
 and upper portion of the face,

1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:18.040
 glabrous portions of the body,

1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:21.080
 using cool rags, using ice packs,

1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:24.680
 or using any number of different cold objects

1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:25.540
 or temperatures.

1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:30.100
 One key thing if you're going to use glabrous skin cooling

1:50:30.100 --> 1:50:33.160
 is that whatever you use to cool those surfaces

1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:37.080
 cannot be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction.

1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:38.920
 Because as I mentioned earlier,

1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:41.660
 the arteriovenous osteomoses,

1:50:41.660 --> 1:50:43.920
 these portals of arteries directly to veins

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:47.780
 that exist only in these glabrous skin surfaces,

1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:51.580
 the way that they're able to cool the body

1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:53.920
 and essentially pass cool into the body,

1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:55.080
 although that's not really what they're doing,

1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:57.420
 they're actually extracting heat from the body

1:50:57.420 --> 1:51:00.520
 to be technical, they're extracting heat from the body.

1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:02.520
 The only way they can do that

1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:05.120
 is if those veins don't collapse,

1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:08.800
 and veins will collapse if they are made very, very cold.

1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:11.540
 So if you want to use glabrous skin cooling

1:51:11.540 --> 1:51:12.840
 to offset hyperthermia,

1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:14.420
 or for the other forms of performance,

1:51:14.420 --> 1:51:16.200
 which we will talk about in a moment,

1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:19.640
 you need to use a cool object or surface

1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:22.240
 that is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction.

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:24.720
 And this can be a little bit tough to dial in,

1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:27.920
 meaning it can be tough to identify such an object.

1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:30.340
 And for that reason, Dr. Heller and some of his colleagues

1:51:30.340 --> 1:51:32.480
 have developed a commercial product called the CoolMitt.

1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:34.560
 You can actually go to their website, coolmitt.com.

1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:37.800
 I don't have any financial or other relationship to them.

1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:39.520
 I know they've been developing this technology

1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:40.440
 for some period of time.

1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:43.540
 It involves a glove that you put your hand into.

1:51:43.540 --> 1:51:46.660
 It circulates water of a given temperature,

1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:49.320
 and it does so at a temperature

1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:53.120
 that is sure to not cause vasoconstriction of the palm.

1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:53.960
 And you may be asking,

1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:56.180
 how can you just put your hand into one glove

1:51:56.180 --> 1:51:57.020
 and have this work?

1:51:57.020 --> 1:51:59.760
 Well, that's how powerful these glabrous skin surfaces are,

1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:02.800
 even just by cooling one palm,

1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:06.300
 the core body temperature drops radically.

1:52:06.300 --> 1:52:08.920
 Now that's their commercial technology.

1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:10.080
 I know that some people out there

1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:13.060
 have started to experiment with a home version of this,

1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:15.580
 which would be taking a package, for instance,

1:52:15.580 --> 1:52:18.920
 of frozen blueberries or some other cold drink

1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:21.760
 or cold metal object and actually bringing it into the gym

1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:23.380
 or out on a run.

1:52:23.380 --> 1:52:25.080
 There are even people who are now developing

1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:29.200
 cooled bicycle handles for long rides.

1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:31.320
 This might seem a little kooky or crazy to you,

1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:35.040
 but as you'll soon hear in the study I'm about to describe,

1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:37.300
 the increases in endurance

1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:39.880
 and in the volume of strength training

1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:41.740
 that people can conduct

1:52:41.740 --> 1:52:43.780
 if they appropriately cool their body

1:52:43.780 --> 1:52:46.200
 through these glabrous skin portals

1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:48.400
 is actually quite significant.

1:52:48.400 --> 1:52:50.520
 So again, as it relates to hyperthermia,

1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:52.260
 if someone is overheating,

1:52:52.260 --> 1:52:54.240
 by all means, try and get them out of that heat,

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:55.720
 get them to stop exercising.

1:52:55.720 --> 1:52:57.640
 You can die from hyperthermia.

1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.080
 Try and cool the bottoms of the feet,

1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:01.300
 the palms of their hands

1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:03.200
 and the upper portion of their face.

1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:06.440
 That does not mean that it would be a bad idea

1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:08.160
 to put cold water on the top of their head.

1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:10.640
 That probably would also help and perhaps on their neck.

1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:13.400
 What is probably not going to be a good idea

1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:15.720
 is to do the more standard thing

1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:17.300
 of draping someone in cold towels

1:53:17.300 --> 1:53:18.360
 on the surface of their body

1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:20.460
 because as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

1:53:20.460 --> 1:53:22.360
 that thermostat in the hypothalamus,

1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:23.860
 the medial preoptic area,

1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:25.660
 will typically react to that

1:53:25.660 --> 1:53:28.240
 by increasing core body temperature further.

1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.400
 The effects of glabrous skin cooling

1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:32.800
 on physical performance are truly remarkable

1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:36.360
 provided the glabrous skin cooling is done correctly.

1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:39.960
 And I want to point out that the main degree of effect

1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:44.200
 is on volume or the ability to do more work.

1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:45.400
 And I want to point this out

1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:47.640
 because I think that many people,

1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:49.320
 certainly in the exercise science community,

1:53:49.320 --> 1:53:50.520
 but even in the general public,

1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:52.440
 when they hear about some of these effects

1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:54.600
 that are measured in the laboratory,

1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:59.080
 they sort of look at those effects a bit askance

1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:01.040
 and they think, well, that's not possible, right?

1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:03.400
 Effects, for instance, that have been documented

1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:05.860
 showing doubling or tripling of the number of dips

1:54:05.860 --> 1:54:08.760
 that one can do in a relatively short amount of time,

1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:11.760
 or doubling of the number of pull-ups one can do,

1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:13.920
 or 14% increases in strength,

1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:16.480
 or even comparable degrees in increase

1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:18.280
 in weight training output

1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:20.400
 to people who are on performance enhancing drugs,

1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:22.200
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:25.000
 Part of the confusion is that the effects

1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:27.380
 of proper Palmer cooling,

1:54:27.380 --> 1:54:30.080
 because it almost always is done by Palmer cooling

1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:32.400
 and less often in these experiments

1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:34.080
 by cooling of the bottoms of the feet

1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:35.520
 in the upper portion of the face,

1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.840
 but those effects tend to be the ability

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:42.880
 to do more work over time.

1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:45.160
 And just to illustrate some of the major effects

1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:46.320
 that the Heller lab has seen

1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:48.080
 and that are documented in this manuscript

1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:49.920
 that I'll share with you in a moment,

1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:53.320
 the typical protocol is to have people come in

1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:54.720
 and do some endurance training,

1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:56.200
 so running on a treadmill,

1:54:56.200 --> 1:54:59.440
 and to have a condition where one group

1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:00.960
 is actually doing Palmer cooling

1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:03.600
 while they are on a bike or on a treadmill.

1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:06.960
 And inevitably the outcome is that they can do more work.

1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:09.920
 They can pedal further at a given speed,

1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:12.780
 or they can run longer at a given speed

1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:14.800
 than people who are not doing Palmer cooling

1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:18.040
 or who are receiving cooling by way of, you know,

1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:19.600
 cold compress to the back of the neck

1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:22.760
 or ice pack to the armpits, et cetera.

1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:25.040
 So the effects of Palmer cooling are very clear

1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:26.720
 and very robust.

1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:29.560
 And in the context of endurance exercise,

1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:31.920
 almost always allow people to do more work,

1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:34.080
 to go longer with less perceived effort

1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:36.140
 and to quit later, so to speak.

1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:38.780
 In terms of strength training,

1:55:38.780 --> 1:55:42.540
 they've looked at the capacity to perform sets of dips.

1:55:42.540 --> 1:55:44.760
 So one of the more famous examples of this

1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:48.760
 that Dr. Heller shares in the episode that we did earlier

1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:50.940
 and that you can find at Hubermanlab.com

1:55:50.940 --> 1:55:54.080
 involves someone coming in and doing sets of dips,

1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:55.900
 maybe 40 dips,

1:55:55.900 --> 1:55:58.320
 this person actually could do 40 dips on their first set,

1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:00.600
 then resting for a period of two to three minutes

1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:02.420
 and then doing 35

1:56:02.420 --> 1:56:04.480
 and then resting for a period of two or three minutes

1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:06.840
 and then doing progressively fewer and fewer and fewer

1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:09.400
 to the point where over a period of time,

1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:11.800
 they add up the total number of dips that they can do,

1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:14.220
 and then they have them come back

1:56:14.220 --> 1:56:15.620
 after a period of recovery.

1:56:15.620 --> 1:56:18.700
 So not immediately after, but take a couple of days,

1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:21.520
 come back and do effectively the same protocol,

1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:22.900
 but during their rest periods,

1:56:22.900 --> 1:56:25.880
 they're doing two minutes of Palmer cooling,

1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:29.320
 which essentially allows heat to move out of the body,

1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:31.520
 lowering core body temperature, in other words.

1:56:31.520 --> 1:56:35.320
 And what they find is that they see enormous increases

1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:37.280
 in the total number of dips that people can do,

1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:38.600
 but that doesn't mean that the person goes

1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:39.880
 from being able to do 40 dips

1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:43.080
 to being able to do 50 dips or 60 dips on that first set.

1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:46.020
 What it means is they are able to do 40 on the first set,

1:56:46.020 --> 1:56:48.880
 then 40 on the second, then 38 on the third

1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:50.040
 and so on and so forth,

1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:52.800
 so that the total duration of the workout is extended

1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:55.480
 and yet they're doing much more work,

1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:57.300
 even though it takes more time.

1:56:57.300 --> 1:56:59.400
 So that's an important point.

1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:02.840
 And I think a point that perhaps wasn't as clear

1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:05.400
 or as clearly made by me in the previous episodes

1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:07.420
 that discussed this topic.

1:57:07.420 --> 1:57:08.700
 For those of you that are interested

1:57:08.700 --> 1:57:10.920
 in exploring Palmer cooling,

1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:13.780
 first of all, I recommend taking a brief glance

1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:17.040
 or even a deep dive into this study,

1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:18.560
 which is entitled work volume

1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:21.180
 and strength training responses to resistive exercise

1:57:21.180 --> 1:57:24.280
 improve with periodic heat extraction from the palm.

1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:30.360
 In this study, they describe big increases in anaerobic,

1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:32.600
 meaning strength training output,

1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:36.960
 things like improvement in dips, improvement in bench press,

1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:40.720
 improvement in pull-ups, et cetera, in human subjects.

1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:42.360
 And it's a really nice study

1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:43.920
 and points to some of the protocols

1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:46.760
 that you might be able to adapt in your own setup.

1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:48.880
 For instance, over six weeks of pull-up training,

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:53.880
 palm cooling in between sets, improved volume by 144%.

1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:56.440
 And this was in experienced subjects.

1:57:56.440 --> 1:57:58.840
 So that's interesting because a lot of studies

1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:01.320
 of strength training and improvements in hypertrophy

1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:04.560
 and strength are done in inexperienced untrained athletes,

1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:07.340
 which changes the picture somewhat

1:58:07.340 --> 1:58:10.640
 compared to experienced athletes.

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:13.440
 They found that strength, meaning the one repetition maximum

1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:17.120
 increased 22% over 10 weeks in bench press training.

1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:20.000
 And they point to the particularly strong effects

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:23.360
 of using Palmer cooling when people reach plateaus

1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:25.080
 in endurance and strength training.

1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:26.660
 And there, I think it's an important point.

1:58:26.660 --> 1:58:30.240
 I think that if you're going to explore Palmer cooling,

1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:32.560
 it's probably not the sort of thing that you're going to do

1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:36.000
 in every run or in every bout of cycling

1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.600
 or in every strength training session,

1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:42.480
 but that it might be used to vastly increase your volume

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.720
 or vastly increase your endurance in a given session

1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:49.060
 or a set of sessions in order to push through plateaus.

1:58:49.060 --> 1:58:51.640
 A particularly interesting point in light of that

1:58:51.640 --> 1:58:54.680
 is Dr. Heller has observed again and again

1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:57.620
 that Palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness

1:58:57.620 --> 1:58:59.440
 or can eliminate it entirely.

1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:01.560
 And that's very interesting because it also points

1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:03.920
 to the fact that reducing core body temperature

1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:06.160
 may somehow be involved in short circuiting

1:59:06.160 --> 1:59:09.620
 the normal mechanisms of delayed onset muscle soreness.

1:59:09.620 --> 1:59:11.920
 And you might say, well, how would temperature

1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:14.320
 be involved in delayed onset muscle soreness?

1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:17.560
 Well, I want to refer you back to the meta analysis

1:59:17.560 --> 1:59:20.360
 that we talked about earlier where the short duration,

1:59:20.360 --> 1:59:23.040
 very cold temperature exposure after training

1:59:23.040 --> 1:59:25.480
 did indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness

1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:28.960
 in part through reduction, excuse me, in creatine kinase.

1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:32.280
 So it's not inconceivable that temperature

1:59:32.280 --> 1:59:34.960
 and delayed onset muscle soreness are related.

1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:37.160
 And that raises perhaps the most important point,

1:59:37.160 --> 1:59:42.160
 which is the way that Palmer cooling can improve performance

1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:46.080
 by way of reducing core body temperature is known.

1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:50.360
 And that is because when one engages in exercise

1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:52.080
 or muscular output of any kind,

1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:54.880
 strength or endurance exercise,

1:59:54.880 --> 1:59:58.360
 the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform

1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:00.560
 is actually very narrow.

2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:02.760
 There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase,

2:00:02.760 --> 2:00:05.600
 which is critical to muscle contractions

2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:07.900
 and pyruvate kinase can only function

2:00:07.900 --> 2:00:09.780
 in a very narrow range of temperatures.

2:00:09.780 --> 2:00:11.500
 If that temperature gets too hot,

2:00:11.500 --> 2:00:13.880
 meaning if the muscle heats up locally,

2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:16.240
 whether or not by running or cycling or swimming

2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:19.240
 or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle

2:00:19.240 --> 2:00:21.500
 to continue to contract is reduced

2:00:21.500 --> 2:00:23.880
 and eventually is short-circuited completely.

2:00:23.880 --> 2:00:26.760
 And I think this is a much under explored

2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:29.400
 or at least a much under discussed aspect

2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:31.000
 of so-called muscular failure

2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:35.280
 or the failure of one to continue to endure in running.

2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:36.680
 So for instance, when you run

2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:38.720
 as compared to a bench press or something,

2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:39.920
 you don't stop running

2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:42.400
 because you can't actually contract the muscles further,

2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:46.000
 but somehow signals about the heating up

2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.700
 of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain.

2:00:48.700 --> 2:00:49.720
 There's a crosstalk there.

2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:53.340
 It's probably bi-directional and people stop, they quit.

2:00:53.340 --> 2:00:54.840
 This is the quitting reflex.

2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:58.140
 In strength training,

2:00:58.140 --> 2:01:00.160
 one can no longer perform a repetition

2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:01.720
 or set of repetitions in part

2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:03.460
 because of heating up of the muscle locally.

2:01:03.460 --> 2:01:05.540
 There are other mechanisms as well, of course,

2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:06.980
 and I realize that.

2:01:06.980 --> 2:01:09.620
 But what's very clear from the palmar cooling work

2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:13.220
 is that by simply holding onto a cool object,

2:01:13.220 --> 2:01:14.880
 remember not an object so cold

2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:17.080
 that it constricts the vessels of the palms

2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:20.040
 or constricts the vessels on the bottoms of the feet,

2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:22.760
 but by holding onto a relatively cool object

2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:26.080
 in one or both hands in between sets for two minutes or so,

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.780
 you can very efficiently reduce your core body temperature.

2:01:29.780 --> 2:01:31.160
 And in doing so,

2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:32.880
 reduce the temperature of the muscles

2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:34.080
 that are doing the work,

2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:37.880
 increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase

2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:40.760
 to continue to allow your muscles to contract

2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:43.980
 and thereby allow you to do more volume of endurance

2:01:43.980 --> 2:01:45.000
 and strength training.

2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:48.180
 So a simple protocol that Dr. Heller passed to me

2:01:48.180 --> 2:01:51.560
 is find a relatively cool object.

2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:54.360
 So you could, for instance, fill two bottles with cold water,

2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:56.440
 maybe put a few ice cubes in there, right?

2:01:56.440 --> 2:01:58.400
 This is not exact because we're not talking

2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:00.020
 about the commercial cool mint product here,

2:02:00.020 --> 2:02:01.800
 we're talking about an at-home version,

2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:05.280
 or use a pack of frozen blueberries or broccoli,

2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:07.800
 the sort of pack of those as what he described,

2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:10.380
 and then in between sets to put your hands,

2:02:10.380 --> 2:02:12.080
 and ideally you'd put the bottoms of your feet,

2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:13.880
 but that's not always feasible in most gyms

2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:16.180
 where they won't let you take off your shoes and so forth,

2:02:16.180 --> 2:02:19.120
 but to put the palms of your hands on that cool surface

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:22.520
 for a minute or two minutes between sets

2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:24.880
 and then returning to your sets of work.

2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:28.600
 Now, if you are heating up through other mechanisms,

2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:29.900
 like you're wearing a stocking cap

2:02:29.900 --> 2:02:31.500
 and you're in a very warm environment,

2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:33.400
 this might not have as potent an effect

2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:35.080
 as if you were to do this cooling

2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:36.740
 in a more moderate environment

2:02:36.740 --> 2:02:38.640
 wearing lighter clothing, et cetera.

2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:41.480
 So by all means, warm up to do your exercise,

2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:43.240
 lubricate your joints and get into a place

2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:44.340
 where you're not going to injure yourself

2:02:44.340 --> 2:02:46.400
 doing whatever form of exercise you do,

2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:48.920
 but then if you'd like to explore Palmer cooling,

2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:51.120
 I know a number of people who've written to me saying

2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:52.220
 they heard about Palmer cooling

2:02:52.220 --> 2:02:53.460
 on the episode with Dr. Heller,

2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:56.600
 they've tried this and they see quite excellent results.

2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:58.200
 It does take some discipline, right?

2:02:58.200 --> 2:02:59.920
 It's one thing to just kind of hang out in the gym

2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:01.240
 and play on your phone in between sets.

2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:04.120
 It's another to do deliberate cooling with your palms

2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:04.960
 or the bottoms of your feet

2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:06.520
 or the upper portion of your face.

2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:07.880
 You might get some weird looks,

2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:09.060
 but of course you'll be the one

2:03:09.060 --> 2:03:11.040
 doing significantly more volume,

2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:13.500
 not experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness

2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:16.000
 and achieving better endurance and strength gains

2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:17.500
 were you to do this properly.

2:03:17.500 --> 2:03:19.920
 Now, as a final topic related to the use

2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:21.400
 of deliberate cold exposure

2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:23.760
 for improving health and performance,

2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.520
 I'd like to touch on this theme that exists online

2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:29.000
 on social media, on YouTube,

2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.760
 and in various fitness communities

2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:34.280
 of using deliberate cold exposure to the groin,

2:03:34.280 --> 2:03:36.300
 in particular to the testicles,

2:03:36.300 --> 2:03:39.280
 in order to try and increase testosterone.

2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:41.620
 And while this might sound really kooky,

2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:44.360
 indeed this practice exists.

2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:47.120
 Indeed, if you were to go on the Amazon,

2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:50.360
 there are actually ice pack underwear

2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:52.560
 that are being marketed

2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:54.800
 for sake of increasing testosterone.

2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:57.800
 Now, I am not aware of any specific well-controlled studies

2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:00.400
 that show that this indeed works.

2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:03.720
 I can imagine based on what I know about the nervous system,

2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:06.000
 testosterone and cold, et cetera,

2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:07.340
 that there are a couple of mechanisms

2:04:07.340 --> 2:04:11.000
 by which one might experience increases in testosterone

2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.120
 as a consequence of deliberate cold exposure.

2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:14.840
 First off, let me say there is no reason

2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:17.960
 why you would have to apply these ice packs

2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:20.360
 in the way that I just described.

2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.200
 One could, of course, take a cold shower.

2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:26.280
 One could, of course, use cold immersion of various kinds,

2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:28.660
 and you're still going to get that exposure

2:04:28.660 --> 2:04:31.380
 of the groin and the testicles to cold.

2:04:31.380 --> 2:04:34.680
 Now, I should point out that people do report,

2:04:34.680 --> 2:04:38.460
 at least anecdotally, increases in testosterone

2:04:38.460 --> 2:04:40.000
 as a consequence of this practice.

2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:41.160
 And I have to imagine

2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:43.040
 that they are measuring their serum testosterone,

2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:44.040
 that they're not just guessing

2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:46.420
 that their testosterone went up.

2:04:46.420 --> 2:04:48.480
 If you know of a study exploring this directly,

2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:49.720
 please let me know,

2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:51.520
 put it in the comment section on YouTube,

2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:53.160
 or even just email me.

2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:57.400
 We have a email that you can find at hubermanlab.com.

2:04:57.400 --> 2:04:58.880
 Please email me the reference.

2:04:58.880 --> 2:05:00.600
 I wasn't able to find a reference.

2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:04.220
 But I can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms

2:05:04.220 --> 2:05:07.540
 by which deliberate cold exposure to the groin

2:05:07.540 --> 2:05:10.720
 and particularly the testicles would increase testosterone.

2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:13.240
 The first is somewhat direct,

2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:17.080
 which is that anytime you cool a body surface,

2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:18.480
 that if it's cold enough,

2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:20.200
 you're going to get vasoconstriction.

2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:21.280
 And then subsequently,

2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:24.680
 you're going to get a rebound increase in vasodilation,

2:05:24.680 --> 2:05:26.620
 meaning you're going to constrict the blood vessels

2:05:26.620 --> 2:05:27.460
 in that area.

2:05:27.460 --> 2:05:29.520
 And then after the cold is removed,

2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:31.400
 there's going to be more blood flow to that area.

2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:33.520
 And of course, blood flow relates

2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:35.800
 to organ health and tissue health generally,

2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:40.800
 so perfusion of that region and the gonads, to be specific.

2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:42.860
 With additional blood,

2:05:42.860 --> 2:05:46.200
 you could imagine in some ways increasing testosterone.

2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:48.300
 That's reasonably plausible.

2:05:48.300 --> 2:05:51.580
 The other probably more likely mechanism relates

2:05:51.580 --> 2:05:54.900
 to the dopamine increases caused by cold exposure

2:05:54.900 --> 2:05:56.300
 that we talked about earlier.

2:05:56.300 --> 2:05:59.640
 Again, anytime you have a somewhat stressful stimulus,

2:05:59.640 --> 2:06:01.440
 but in particular with cold exposure,

2:06:01.440 --> 2:06:04.500
 it seems that the catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine

2:06:04.500 --> 2:06:07.320
 and dopamine all increase.

2:06:07.320 --> 2:06:10.800
 And dopamine is known to be in the pathway

2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:13.060
 that can stimulate testosterone.

2:06:13.060 --> 2:06:15.100
 And so while there isn't a direct relationship

2:06:15.100 --> 2:06:17.260
 between dopamine stimulating testosterone,

2:06:17.260 --> 2:06:20.220
 there is an interesting pathway whereby dopamine increases

2:06:20.220 --> 2:06:23.300
 can trigger increases in things like luteinizing hormone,

2:06:23.300 --> 2:06:26.060
 which can trigger increases in testosterone,

2:06:26.060 --> 2:06:28.140
 as well as estrogen for that matter.

2:06:28.140 --> 2:06:30.180
 So I know that there are a lot of people out there

2:06:30.180 --> 2:06:31.960
 that are interested in the use of cold exposure

2:06:31.960 --> 2:06:33.380
 for increasing testosterone.

2:06:33.380 --> 2:06:35.360
 And some of those people in communities

2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:40.240
 are indeed using cold exposure directly on the gonads,

2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:42.420
 on the testes in order to do this.

2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:46.340
 I'm not certain that that direct contact is necessary.

2:06:46.340 --> 2:06:51.040
 And in some cases it might actually be quite dangerous

2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:52.380
 or you at least should be careful

2:06:52.380 --> 2:06:55.760
 in terms of the tissues there and avoiding damage.

2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:59.880
 But nonetheless, I think that a dopamine impact

2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:04.020
 on testosterone is very likely given the 250% increases

2:07:04.020 --> 2:07:05.280
 in dopamine that have been observed

2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:06.380
 with cold water immersion.

2:07:06.380 --> 2:07:07.660
 And all of that points to the fact

2:07:07.660 --> 2:07:12.660
 that cold water immersion very likely increases testosterone,

2:07:13.320 --> 2:07:15.260
 but as a downstream consequence

2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:17.380
 of the cold water immersion effects

2:07:17.380 --> 2:07:19.500
 on dopamine and luteinizing hormone.

2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:21.080
 And again, there's no reason to think

2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:23.200
 that the increases in luteinizing hormone

2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:25.260
 would also increase estrogen,

2:07:25.260 --> 2:07:29.300
 probably not too dangerous or levels

2:07:29.300 --> 2:07:31.560
 that one would want to avoid.

2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:33.140
 But I don't think that there's anything

2:07:33.140 --> 2:07:36.860
 particularly specific about cold for inducing testosterone

2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:38.140
 and not other hormones.

2:07:38.140 --> 2:07:39.300
 I think it's very likely to increase

2:07:39.300 --> 2:07:41.540
 as a number of different hormones.

2:07:41.540 --> 2:07:44.280
 I do hope that there will be a systematic study on this

2:07:44.280 --> 2:07:45.820
 in the not too distant future.

2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:47.720
 I also hope to not be a subject

2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:50.360
 in the cooling of the gonads experiment.

2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:52.540
 Now, I promise you the last topic was the last topic,

2:07:52.540 --> 2:07:54.580
 but there's one other really important point

2:07:54.580 --> 2:07:56.400
 that I think everyone should be aware of

2:07:56.400 --> 2:07:59.020
 if you're going to use deliberate cold exposure.

2:07:59.020 --> 2:08:01.940
 And that brings us back to the very first thing

2:08:01.940 --> 2:08:03.460
 that we discussed today

2:08:03.460 --> 2:08:05.180
 along the lines of deliberate cold exposure,

2:08:05.180 --> 2:08:07.140
 which is that your baseline temperature

2:08:07.140 --> 2:08:11.440
 is going to be lowest about two hours before you wake up.

2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:15.040
 It's going to increase in the morning and as you wake up,

2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:17.260
 and increase throughout the day and afternoon,

2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.200
 and then start to drop in the evening

2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:21.400
 and come down at night as you head to sleep.

2:08:22.980 --> 2:08:24.520
 I also want you to remember

2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:27.980
 that if you are to cool the external portion of your body,

2:08:27.980 --> 2:08:30.340
 in particular your torso,

2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:31.940
 the net effect of that

2:08:31.940 --> 2:08:35.460
 is going to be an increase in body temperature.

2:08:35.460 --> 2:08:38.900
 So for many people, not all, but for many people,

2:08:38.900 --> 2:08:41.980
 if you are going to do deliberate cold exposure,

2:08:41.980 --> 2:08:45.180
 you are going to increase your core body temperature.

2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:46.660
 And that makes sense if you think about

2:08:46.660 --> 2:08:50.180
 how deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism

2:08:50.180 --> 2:08:52.400
 by increasing thermogenesis.

2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:54.700
 What that all means is

2:08:54.700 --> 2:08:57.340
 that if you are doing your deliberate cold exposure

2:08:57.340 --> 2:08:58.700
 early in the day,

2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:01.500
 you are going to get yet a further increase

2:09:01.500 --> 2:09:03.020
 in core body temperature

2:09:03.020 --> 2:09:05.620
 that would be associated with wakefulness,

2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:07.460
 your ability to be alert that morning

2:09:07.460 --> 2:09:10.260
 or throughout the day, and so on.

2:09:10.260 --> 2:09:13.880
 It also means that if you do your deliberate cold exposure

2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:16.280
 very late in the evening or at night,

2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:21.280
 so 6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9 p.m., and so on,

2:09:21.300 --> 2:09:23.700
 you are going to increase your core body temperature.

2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:25.780
 And if you recall,

2:09:25.780 --> 2:09:29.500
 a decrease in core body temperature of one to three degrees

2:09:29.500 --> 2:09:31.300
 is not just beneficial,

2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:34.340
 but is necessary in order to get into deep sleep

2:09:34.340 --> 2:09:36.380
 and remain in deep sleep.

2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:38.380
 So the takeaway from this is

2:09:38.380 --> 2:09:40.480
 deliberate cold exposure done properly

2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:42.240
 will increase your core body temperature

2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:44.220
 and make you feel more alert.

2:09:44.220 --> 2:09:46.200
 So if you're doing it early in the day,

2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:48.180
 that's probably terrific,

2:09:48.180 --> 2:09:50.940
 given that most of us want to be alert during the day.

2:09:50.940 --> 2:09:53.220
 However, if you do it too late in the day,

2:09:53.220 --> 2:09:55.880
 evening or night, it can disrupt sleep

2:09:55.880 --> 2:09:58.780
 by way of disrupting your core body temperature.

2:09:58.780 --> 2:10:02.320
 Now, the caveat to that is I myself

2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:05.140
 tend to do my deliberate cold exposure early in the day,

2:10:05.140 --> 2:10:07.560
 maybe not first thing in the morning, but mid-morning,

2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:09.580
 maybe as late as three or four in the afternoon

2:10:09.580 --> 2:10:10.420
 in some cases.

2:10:10.420 --> 2:10:12.760
 In the longer days of summer, I might do it even later,

2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:15.600
 5 or 6 p.m., and have no trouble sleeping.

2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:18.940
 I have done deliberate cold exposure very late at night,

2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:21.740
 10 p.m., 11 p.m., and so on,

2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.540
 as part of a 30-day challenge of doing

2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:25.940
 deliberate cold exposure every day for 30 days,

2:10:25.940 --> 2:10:27.540
 and I got sloppy with my timing,

2:10:27.540 --> 2:10:29.300
 and then in order to not miss a day,

2:10:29.300 --> 2:10:30.940
 I would do it at 11 o'clock at night.

2:10:30.940 --> 2:10:34.300
 And I must say, I found that I could still fall asleep

2:10:34.300 --> 2:10:36.940
 very easily, even doing deliberate cold exposure

2:10:36.940 --> 2:10:38.060
 very late at night.

2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:42.280
 However, on those particular days, I was particularly busy,

2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:44.580
 and so I was particularly exhausted

2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:46.860
 when I arrived at the deliberate cold exposure,

2:10:46.860 --> 2:10:49.100
 and I had no trouble falling asleep

2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:50.540
 after doing deliberate cold exposure

2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:53.020
 and then taking a nice warm shower and then going to sleep.

2:10:53.020 --> 2:10:56.020
 But I could imagine that because of the increases

2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:59.340
 in core body temperature caused by deliberate cold exposure,

2:10:59.340 --> 2:11:02.060
 that were one to do that too late in the day,

2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:04.860
 evening or night, that it could indeed disrupt your sleep.

2:11:04.860 --> 2:11:07.680
 So my recommendation would be for most people,

2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:09.220
 only do deliberate cold exposure

2:11:09.220 --> 2:11:11.560
 if you are prepared to be fairly alert

2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:14.820
 for the next one to four or maybe even six hours

2:11:14.820 --> 2:11:17.000
 following that deliberate cold exposure.

2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:18.860
 So for today's episode, as is the case

2:11:18.860 --> 2:11:21.720
 with most episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:23.180
 I covered a lot of material.

2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:25.940
 We talked about mechanisms of catecholamines and stress

2:11:25.940 --> 2:11:28.580
 and pulsatile release of epinephrine,

2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:31.140
 metabolism, mental effects, performance,

2:11:31.140 --> 2:11:33.880
 glabrous skin cooling, and on and on and on.

2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:36.100
 And while the goal of course is to make sure

2:11:36.100 --> 2:11:39.460
 that everyone arrives at specific, very clear,

2:11:39.460 --> 2:11:41.740
 mechanistic and actionable protocols,

2:11:41.740 --> 2:11:44.780
 I do realize that it is an immense amount of information.

2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:47.140
 And for that reason, I've created a list

2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:49.940
 of deliberate cold exposure protocols

2:11:49.940 --> 2:11:53.660
 aimed at improving mental toughness and resilience,

2:11:53.660 --> 2:11:57.000
 mood, performance, metabolism,

2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.440
 reducing inflammation, and so on and so forth.

2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:02.700
 All of those have been condensed into succinct form

2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:04.180
 and can be found

2:12:04.180 --> 2:12:06.860
 at the Huberman Lab Neural Network Newsletter.

2:12:06.860 --> 2:12:09.380
 This is a monthly or semi-monthly newsletter

2:12:09.380 --> 2:12:11.540
 that we release that includes takeaways

2:12:11.540 --> 2:12:13.660
 from the podcast and protocols.

2:12:13.660 --> 2:12:16.480
 You can access those protocols, zero cost,

2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:19.060
 by simply going to HubermanLab.com,

2:12:19.060 --> 2:12:20.900
 signing up for the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:12:20.900 --> 2:12:21.840
 It's very easy to do.

2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:23.980
 You just supply your email and you will receive

2:12:23.980 --> 2:12:24.940
 the newsletter.

2:12:24.940 --> 2:12:27.780
 We do not share your email with anybody else.

2:12:27.780 --> 2:12:30.740

2:12:30.740 --> 2:12:33.100
 on the HubermanLab.com website,

2:12:33.100 --> 2:12:34.660
 so you can find that there.

2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:36.740
 And the protocols that I've designed

2:12:36.740 --> 2:12:39.300
 should make it very straightforward for you to create

2:12:40.380 --> 2:12:42.800
 a set of protocols that you could use with cold showers,

2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:44.820
 with cold immersion, with or without ice,

2:12:44.820 --> 2:12:47.500
 in combination with exercise, specifically for one goal

2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.580
 or another, or to accomplish multiple goals simultaneously.

2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:52.780

 That is the best way to support this podcast.

2:13:25.860 --> 2:13:27.620
 In addition, we have a Patreon.

2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:30.380
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

2:13:30.380 --> 2:13:32.220
 and there you can support the podcast

2:13:32.220 --> 2:13:33.740
 at any level that you like.

2:13:33.740 --> 2:13:36.360
 On many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:37.820
 we talk about supplements.

2:13:37.820 --> 2:13:39.940
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:13:39.940 --> 2:13:42.180
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:13:42.180 --> 2:13:44.880
 for things like sleep and focus and other aspects

2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:46.460
 of health and performance.

2:13:46.460 --> 2:13:47.960
 One issue with the supplement industry

2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:49.580
 that's very serious, however,

2:13:49.580 --> 2:13:52.620
 is that many supplement companies simply do not use

2:13:52.620 --> 2:13:55.600
 high quality ingredients or the amounts of the ingredients

2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:57.940
 they list on the packaging does not match

2:13:57.940 --> 2:13:59.800
 what's actually contained in their products.

2:13:59.800 --> 2:14:03.540
 For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:14:03.540 --> 2:14:05.520
 because Thorne supplements are known to be

2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:07.340
 of the very highest quality ingredients

2:14:07.340 --> 2:14:10.100
 and the very highest degree of specificity

2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:12.140
 in terms of the amounts of the ingredients

2:14:12.140 --> 2:14:13.700
 that are listed on the packaging

2:14:13.700 --> 2:14:16.640
 accurately match what's contained in their products.

2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:18.560
 If you'd like to see the Thorne products that I take,

2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:21.940
 you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E dot com

2:14:21.940 --> 2:14:24.140
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:14:24.140 --> 2:14:26.160
 and there you can see the Thorne products that I take

2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:28.580
 and get 20% off any of those products.

2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:31.060
 In addition, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

2:14:31.060 --> 2:14:32.380
 through that portal, Thorne,

2:14:32.380 --> 2:14:36.380
 T-H-O-R-N-E dot com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:14:36.380 --> 2:14:38.800
 you can also get 20% off any of the other products

2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:40.020
 that Thorne makes.

2:14:40.020 --> 2:14:42.180
 If you're not already subscribed to Huberman Lab

2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:44.440
 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:46.880
 There I cover science and science-related tools

2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:49.600
 that sometimes overlap with the content of the podcast,

2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:51.900
 but oftentimes is distinct from the information

2:14:51.900 --> 2:14:53.580
 covered on this podcast.

2:14:53.580 --> 2:14:56.420
 So thank you once again for joining me in the discussion

2:14:56.420 --> 2:14:58.600
 about the use of deliberate cold exposure

2:14:58.600 --> 2:14:59.940
 for health and performance.

2:14:59.940 --> 2:15:02.220
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:15:02.220 --> 2:15:04.140
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:09.140
 I'll see you next time.
