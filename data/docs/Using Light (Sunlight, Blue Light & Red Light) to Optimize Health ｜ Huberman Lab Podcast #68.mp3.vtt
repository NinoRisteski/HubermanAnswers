00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.200
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.200 --> 00:13.320
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.320 --> 00:15.260
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.160
 Today, we are going to discuss light

00:17.160 --> 00:20.880
 and the many powerful uses of light to optimize our health.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.700
 We're going to discuss the use of light

00:22.700 --> 00:26.280
 for optimizing skin health, appearance, and longevity,

00:26.280 --> 00:29.640
 for wound healing, for optimizing hormone balance,

00:29.640 --> 00:32.700
 and for regulating sleep, alertness, mood,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.000
 and even for offsetting dementia.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.540
 One of the reasons why light has such powerful effects

00:37.540 --> 00:40.240
 on so many different aspects of our biology

00:40.240 --> 00:43.800
 is that it can be translated into electrical signals

00:43.800 --> 00:45.100
 in our brain and body,

00:45.100 --> 00:47.600
 into hormone signals in our brain and body,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.400
 and indeed into what we call

00:49.400 --> 00:51.560
 cascades of biological pathways,

00:51.560 --> 00:54.720
 meaning light can actually change the genes

00:54.720 --> 00:56.680
 that the cells of your bodies express,

00:56.680 --> 00:59.120
 and that is true throughout the lifespan.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.760
 Today, I will discuss the mechanisms

01:00.760 --> 01:02.640
 by which all of that occurs.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.480
 I promise to make it clear for those of you

01:04.480 --> 01:06.360
 that don't have a biology background,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.320
 and if you do have a biology background,

01:08.320 --> 01:10.080
 I'll try and provide sufficient depth

01:10.080 --> 01:12.040
 so that it's still of interest to you,

01:12.040 --> 01:14.260
 and I promise to give you tools,

01:14.260 --> 01:16.240
 very specific protocols that are extracted

01:16.240 --> 01:17.640
 from the peer review literature

01:17.640 --> 01:20.660
 that will allow you to use different so-called wavelengths,

01:20.660 --> 01:23.280
 which most of us think of as colors of light,

01:23.280 --> 01:25.600
 in order to modulate your health

01:25.600 --> 01:27.980
 in the ways that are most important to you.

01:27.980 --> 01:28.980
 For those of you that are thinking

01:28.980 --> 01:30.800
 that the use of light to modulate health

01:30.800 --> 01:32.680
 falls under the category of woo science,

01:32.680 --> 01:35.120
 pseudoscience, or biohacking,

01:35.120 --> 01:37.820
 well, nothing could be further from the truth.

01:37.820 --> 01:41.140
 In fact, in 1903, the Nobel Prize was given

01:41.140 --> 01:44.720
 to Niels Vinson, he was Icelandic, he lived in Denmark,

01:44.720 --> 01:48.800
 for the use of phototherapy for the treatment of lupus.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.160
 So there's more than 100 years of quality science

01:52.160 --> 01:54.680
 emphasizing the use of light,

01:54.680 --> 01:55.960
 and as you'll soon see,

01:55.960 --> 01:59.960
 the use of particular wavelengths or colors of light

01:59.960 --> 02:02.360
 in order to modulate the activity of cells

02:02.360 --> 02:04.160
 in the brain and body.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.380
 So while it is the case that many places

02:07.380 --> 02:10.360
 and companies are selling therapies and products

02:10.360 --> 02:14.520
 related to the use of flashing lights and colored lights,

02:14.520 --> 02:16.440
 promising specific outcomes

02:16.440 --> 02:18.840
 from everything from stem cell renewal

02:18.840 --> 02:21.040
 to improvement of brain function,

02:21.040 --> 02:24.440
 and some of those don't have any basis in science,

02:24.440 --> 02:26.160
 there are phototherapies

02:26.160 --> 02:29.480
 that do have a strong foundation in quality science,

02:29.480 --> 02:31.480
 and those are the studies and the protocols

02:31.480 --> 02:33.240
 that we are going to discuss today.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.480
 But I thought that people might appreciate knowing

02:35.480 --> 02:37.400
 that over 100 years ago,

02:37.400 --> 02:39.160
 people were thinking about the use of light

02:39.160 --> 02:40.640
 for the treatment of various diseases

02:40.640 --> 02:41.800
 and for improving health,

02:41.800 --> 02:45.080
 and indeed, many of those therapies are used today

02:45.080 --> 02:48.440
 in high quality hospitals and research institutions,

02:48.440 --> 02:51.100
 and of course, clinics and homes around the world.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.220
 One of the more exciting examples of phototherapy

02:53.220 --> 02:55.420
 in the last few years is the beautiful work

02:55.420 --> 02:58.220
 of Dr. Glenn Jeffrey at University College London.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.260
 The Jeffrey Lab is known for doing pioneering

03:00.260 --> 03:01.360
 and very rigorous research

03:01.360 --> 03:03.360
 in the realm of visual neuroscience.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.680
 And in the last decade or so,

03:04.680 --> 03:06.960
 they turned their attention to exploring the role

03:06.960 --> 03:11.740
 of red light therapy for offsetting age-related vision loss.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.060
 What they discovered is that just brief exposures

03:15.060 --> 03:16.960
 to red light early in the day

03:16.960 --> 03:18.920
 can offset much of the vision loss

03:18.920 --> 03:21.840
 that occurs in people 40 years or older.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.780
 And what's remarkable about these studies

03:23.780 --> 03:26.560
 is that the entire duration of the therapy

03:26.560 --> 03:28.320
 is just one to three minutes done

03:28.320 --> 03:30.080
 just a few times per week.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.360
 What's even more exciting

03:31.360 --> 03:34.960
 is that they understand the mechanism by which this occurred.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.280
 The cells in the back of the eye

03:36.280 --> 03:39.180
 that convert light information into electrical signals

03:39.180 --> 03:41.000
 that the rest of the brain can understand

03:41.000 --> 03:42.800
 and create visual images from,

03:42.800 --> 03:46.000
 well, those cells are extremely metabolically active.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.840
 They need a lot of ATP or energy.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.520
 And as we age, those cells get less efficient

03:53.520 --> 03:56.320
 at creating that ATP and energy.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.960
 Exposure to red light early in the day,

03:58.960 --> 04:01.060
 and it does have to be early in the day,

04:01.060 --> 04:03.900
 allowed those cells to replenish the mechanisms

04:03.900 --> 04:05.960
 by which they create ATP.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.660
 I'll talk about these experiments

04:07.660 --> 04:10.520
 in more detail later in the episode and the protocols

04:10.520 --> 04:13.080
 so that you can apply those protocols should you choose.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.720
 But I use this as an example of our growing understanding

04:17.720 --> 04:21.920
 of not just that phototherapies work, but how they work.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.840
 And it is through the linking of protocols and mechanism

04:25.840 --> 04:28.100
 that we, meaning all of us,

04:28.100 --> 04:29.600
 can start to apply phototherapies

04:29.600 --> 04:32.400
 in a rational, safe, and powerful way.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.240
 I'm pleased to announce

04:33.240 --> 04:36.080
 that I'm hosting two live events this May.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.600
 The first live event will be hosted

04:37.600 --> 04:40.280
 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.880
 The second live event will be hosted

04:41.880 --> 04:44.280
 in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.760
 Both are part of a lecture series

04:45.760 --> 04:47.880
 entitled The Brain-Body Contract,

04:47.880 --> 04:49.600
 during which I will discuss science

04:49.600 --> 04:51.760
 and science-based tools for mental health,

04:51.760 --> 04:53.560
 physical health, and performance.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.960
 I should point out that while some of the material

04:55.960 --> 04:58.640
 I'll cover will overlap with information covered here

04:58.640 --> 05:00.280
 on the Huberman Lab podcast

05:00.280 --> 05:02.120
 and on various social media posts,

05:02.120 --> 05:05.280
 most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct

05:05.280 --> 05:08.160
 from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.680
 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

05:10.680 --> 05:12.040
 Portland on May 18th.

05:12.040 --> 05:16.120
 You can access tickets by going to HubermanLab.com slash tour

05:16.120 --> 05:17.600
 and I hope to see you there.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.280
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

05:19.280 --> 05:20.660
 that this podcast is separate

05:20.660 --> 05:22.980
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.080
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

05:25.080 --> 05:27.760
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

05:27.760 --> 05:30.480
 and science-related tools to the general public.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.620
 In keeping with that theme,

05:31.620 --> 05:34.400
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.320
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, also called AG1.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.240
 I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.680
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.340
 The reason I started taking AG1

05:45.340 --> 05:48.400
 and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day

05:48.400 --> 05:50.660
 is that it covers my foundational vitamin,

05:50.660 --> 05:52.520
 mineral, and probiotic needs.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.960
 It also has adaptogens and things like zinc

05:54.960 --> 05:56.680
 for immune system function,

05:56.680 --> 05:59.440
 but the probiotics are one of the key features in there.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.740
 I've done several podcasts on the gut microbiome,

06:01.740 --> 06:03.600
 which are these trillions of microbiota

06:03.600 --> 06:05.040
 that live in our digestive tract

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
 and that are crucial for our immune system,

06:07.040 --> 06:08.460
 brain function, and so on.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.640
 One way to enhance our gut microbiome

06:11.640 --> 06:12.860
 to ensure that it's healthy

06:12.860 --> 06:15.800
 is to make sure that we get the correct probiotics.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.300
 And Athletic Greens has the correct prebiotics

06:18.300 --> 06:21.620
 and probiotics that ensure a healthy gut microbiome.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.060
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

06:23.060 --> 06:25.860
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:25.860 --> 06:27.180
 to claim a special offer.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.720
 They'll give you five free travel packs

06:28.720 --> 06:30.760
 that make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

06:30.760 --> 06:33.140
 while you're on the road, so in the car and on the plane.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.060
 I should mention that Athletic Greens is delicious.

06:35.060 --> 06:35.880
 I love the way it tastes.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.940
 I mix mine with some water

06:36.940 --> 06:38.460
 and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.660
 The special offer is the five free travel packs

06:40.660 --> 06:43.580
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.580
 Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important

06:45.580 --> 06:48.100
 for a tremendous number of biological functions.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.500
 Many of us who get sunlight get enough vitamin D3.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.580
 Many of us, even if we do get sunlight,

06:53.580 --> 06:55.500
 do not get enough vitamin D3.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
 So the year supply of vitamin D3 also has K2,

06:58.500 --> 07:00.400
 which is important for cardiovascular function,

07:00.400 --> 07:02.060
 for calcium regulation.

07:02.060 --> 07:04.720
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

07:04.720 --> 07:06.060
 to get the five free travel packs

07:06.060 --> 07:08.620
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

07:08.620 --> 07:11.180
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.380
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.660
 Nootropic is a smart drug.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.500
 And personally, I'm not a big fan

07:17.500 --> 07:19.260
 of the concept of a smart drug,

07:19.260 --> 07:22.180
 at least not the way that most people talk about smart drugs

07:22.180 --> 07:24.460
 or nootropics, for the following reason.

07:25.380 --> 07:27.580
 Being smart involves various things.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.580
 There is creativity, there's focus,

07:29.580 --> 07:31.540
 there's task switching, and so on.

07:31.540 --> 07:33.860
 And each one of those involves different operations

07:33.860 --> 07:35.320
 in the brain, different neural circuits,

07:35.320 --> 07:37.840
 different neurochemicals have to be deployed

07:37.840 --> 07:40.380
 in order for us to, for instance, be very focused

07:40.380 --> 07:42.100
 or for us to be very creative

07:42.100 --> 07:45.380
 or for us to be able to switch tasks easily.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.700
 Thesis understands this.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.060
 And for that reason, they've developed custom nootropics

07:50.060 --> 07:52.560
 that are aimed at getting your brain and body

07:52.560 --> 07:55.020
 into particular states for particular types

07:55.020 --> 07:57.940
 of work or physical activity.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.080
 In order to accomplish that,

07:59.080 --> 08:01.700
 they've created unique blends of high quality ingredients.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.460
 And each of those blends is designed

08:03.460 --> 08:05.660
 to get your brain and body into a particular mode

08:05.660 --> 08:08.240
 such as focus, clarity, or motivation.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.300
 I've been using thesis nootropics for over six months now.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.340
 And I have to say, it's been a total game changer

08:13.340 --> 08:15.260
 and very unique from the experience

08:15.260 --> 08:18.120
 of using sort of what I call catch-all nootropics.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.880
 So with thesis, it's really directed

08:19.880 --> 08:21.940
 toward particular brain body states.

08:21.940 --> 08:22.780
 I should also mention

08:22.780 --> 08:25.100
 that they tailor those custom blends to you.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.920
 So by taking a quiz on their site,

08:26.920 --> 08:29.260
 they will tailor the blend to you and your specific needs

08:29.260 --> 08:30.620
 and the things you don't want.

08:30.620 --> 08:31.460
 So if you want to try

08:31.460 --> 08:33.220
 your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

08:33.220 --> 08:36.860
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.

08:36.860 --> 08:38.140
 You'll take a three minute quiz

08:38.140 --> 08:40.140
 and thesis will send you four different formulas

08:40.140 --> 08:41.420
 to try in your first month.

08:41.420 --> 08:43.380
 And then based on the outcomes with those,

08:43.380 --> 08:45.480
 they can update your formulations for you.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.500
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

08:47.500 --> 08:49.160
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

08:49.160 --> 08:51.140
 to get 10% off your first box.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.660
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.340
 Element is a properly balanced electrolyte drink

08:56.340 --> 08:58.340
 that has no sugar.

08:58.340 --> 09:00.820
 When we get our electrolytes in the proper ratios,

09:00.820 --> 09:03.480
 the cells of our brain and body can function optimally.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.020
 Many people are surprised to find

09:05.020 --> 09:07.120
 that when they increase their sodium intake,

09:07.120 --> 09:09.100
 provided that it is in proper balance

09:09.100 --> 09:10.620
 with potassium and magnesium,

09:10.620 --> 09:12.040
 they can think more clearly.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.240
 They recover from exercise better and they have more energy.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.700
 There is no surprise as to how that all works.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.360
 However, every cell of your body

09:19.360 --> 09:21.180
 requires the electrolytes to function.

09:21.180 --> 09:23.460
 And in particular, the neurons of your brain and body

09:23.460 --> 09:25.780
 require sodium in order to function.

09:25.780 --> 09:28.820
 So while people with pre-hypertension and hypertension

09:28.820 --> 09:30.880
 definitely need to be careful about increasing

09:30.880 --> 09:31.900
 their sodium intake,

09:31.900 --> 09:34.780
 many people do well to increase their sodium intake,

09:34.780 --> 09:37.020
 again, provided it's in the proper balance

09:37.020 --> 09:38.820
 with potassium and magnesium.

09:38.820 --> 09:41.240
 Element provides that proper balance.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.880

09:56.440 --> 09:57.860
 Okay, let's talk about light.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.460
 First, I want to talk about the physics of light.

10:00.460 --> 10:01.980
 And I promise to make that very clear,

10:01.980 --> 10:03.740
 even if you don't have a background in physics.

10:03.740 --> 10:06.620
 And then I want to talk about the biology of light,

10:06.620 --> 10:09.680
 meaning how light is converted into signals

10:09.680 --> 10:11.860
 that your brain and body can use

10:11.860 --> 10:15.260
 to impact things like organ health or disease,

10:15.260 --> 10:17.960
 or how you can use light in order to repair

10:17.960 --> 10:19.940
 particular organs like your skin,

10:19.940 --> 10:22.080
 your eyes, your brain, et cetera.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.140
 The physics of light can be made very simple

10:24.140 --> 10:26.840
 by just illustrating a few key bullet points.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.640
 The first bullet point is that

10:28.640 --> 10:31.700
 light is electromagnetic energy.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.660
 If the word electromagnetic feels daunting to you,

10:34.660 --> 10:35.860
 well then just discard that

10:35.860 --> 10:37.720
 and just think of light as energy.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.220
 And think of energy as something that can impact

10:41.220 --> 10:43.700
 other things in its environment.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.080
 Now, the way to imagine light

10:46.080 --> 10:48.380
 or to conceptualize light as energy

10:48.380 --> 10:49.620
 is that all around you,

10:49.620 --> 10:51.580
 light is traveling in these little wavelengths.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.200
 And the reason for those of you that are watching,

10:53.200 --> 10:55.000
 I'm making a little wavy motion with my hand

10:55.000 --> 10:56.900
 is that's actually the way that light energy moves

10:56.900 --> 10:58.020
 in little waves,

10:58.020 --> 10:59.740
 just like sound waves are coming at you

10:59.740 --> 11:01.000
 and impinging on your ears.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.260
 If you can hear me talking right now, that is happening.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.100
 Those are sound waves,

11:04.100 --> 11:07.020
 meaning the movement of air particles out there

11:07.020 --> 11:08.180
 impacting your eardrum.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.740
 Well, light energy is just little bits

11:10.740 --> 11:13.100
 of electromagnetic energy traveling

11:13.100 --> 11:16.740
 through your environment all the time in these little waves

11:16.740 --> 11:20.740
 and impinging on your brain and body and eyes, et cetera.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.180
 And as I mentioned before,

11:22.180 --> 11:25.740
 energy can change the way that other things behave.

11:25.740 --> 11:29.180
 It can cause reactions in cells of your body.

11:29.180 --> 11:32.000
 It can cause reactions in fruit, for instance, right?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.320
 You see a piece of fruit and it's not ripe,

11:34.320 --> 11:36.020
 but it gets a lot of sunlight and it ripens.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.260
 That's because the electromagnetic energy of sunlight

11:39.260 --> 11:42.380
 had an impact on that plant or that tree,

11:42.380 --> 11:44.300
 or even on the fruit directly.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.180
 As a parallel example of energy

11:46.180 --> 11:49.380
 and its ability to impact other things,

11:49.380 --> 11:50.780
 we are all familiar with food

11:50.780 --> 11:52.820
 and the fact that food has calories.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.420
 Calorie is a measure of energy.

11:55.420 --> 11:58.500
 It has everything to do with how much heat is generated

11:58.500 --> 12:00.780
 when you burn a particular article of food,

12:00.780 --> 12:01.840
 believe it or not.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.680
 And it turns out that how hot a given article of food burns

12:06.680 --> 12:08.340
 gives you a sense of how much energy

12:08.340 --> 12:11.540
 it can provide your body in terms of your body's ability

12:11.540 --> 12:13.920
 to store or use that energy.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.860
 So again, think of light as electromagnetic energy,

12:16.860 --> 12:20.980
 but really put that word energy into capital letters,

12:20.980 --> 12:22.900
 embed that in your mind going forward,

12:22.900 --> 12:26.560
 and you'll understand most of the first bullet point

12:26.560 --> 12:29.860
 of what light is in terms of the physics of light.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.860
 Now, the second thing that you need to understand

12:31.860 --> 12:33.100
 about the physics of light

12:33.100 --> 12:35.740
 is that light has many different wavelengths.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.620
 And the simplest way to conceptualize this

12:37.620 --> 12:39.680
 is to imagine that cover of that Pink Floyd album

12:39.680 --> 12:40.760
 where there's a prism,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.660
 you have a white beam of light going into that prism,

12:43.660 --> 12:46.140
 and then the prism splits that beam of light

12:46.140 --> 12:48.080
 into what looks like a rainbow.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.660
 So you've got your red, your orange, your greens,

12:49.660 --> 12:51.820
 your blues, your purples, et cetera.

12:51.820 --> 12:54.080
 Anytime we have light in our environment

12:54.080 --> 12:55.740
 that is so-called white light,

12:55.740 --> 12:57.680
 it includes all those wavelengths,

12:57.680 --> 13:00.840
 but sunlight and other forms of light

13:00.840 --> 13:05.020
 also have other wavelengths of light that we can't see.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.380
 So when we think about the rainbow,

13:06.380 --> 13:09.100
 that's just the visible spectrum of light.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.020
 There are also wavelengths of light

13:11.020 --> 13:12.420
 that are not visible to us,

13:12.420 --> 13:15.280
 but that are visible to some other animals

13:15.280 --> 13:19.140
 and that can still impact your brain and body

13:19.140 --> 13:22.900
 because there is still energy at those wavelengths.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.940
 I'll give a few examples of this.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.420
 Humans are not a species that can see

13:27.420 --> 13:31.380
 into the infrared realm of the spectrum.

13:31.380 --> 13:35.960
 A pit viper, meaning a snake that has infrared sensors,

13:35.960 --> 13:38.900
 however, can sense in the infrared.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.980
 So if you were to walk through a jungle

13:40.980 --> 13:42.640
 and there's a pit viper there,

13:42.640 --> 13:46.340
 it sees you as a cloud of heat emission

13:46.340 --> 13:51.180
 because your body is emitting infrared energy all the time.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.740
 You're casting off infrared energy.

13:53.740 --> 13:55.780
 The snake can see it, you can't.

13:55.780 --> 13:58.700
 If you were to put on a particular set of goggles

13:58.700 --> 14:01.220
 that were infrared goggles,

14:01.220 --> 14:03.580
 well, then you would be able to see the heat emissions

14:03.580 --> 14:06.020
 of any organism, human or otherwise,

14:06.020 --> 14:08.860
 that could emit infrared energy.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.940
 Let's take the opposite end of the spectrum.

14:11.940 --> 14:14.660
 We are familiar with seeing things that are blue or green

14:14.660 --> 14:18.740
 or very pale blue, but as we say below that,

14:18.740 --> 14:21.440
 meaning even shorter wavelength light is out there.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.960
 Ultraviolet light is a really good example

14:23.960 --> 14:26.240
 of light energy that's coming from the sun

14:26.240 --> 14:27.280
 and is in our environment

14:27.280 --> 14:29.700
 and is being reflected off surfaces all the time.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.380
 We don't see it and yet if it's very bright outside,

14:33.380 --> 14:36.280
 that ultraviolet light can burn our skin.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.100
 As you'll learn in today's episode,

14:38.100 --> 14:42.760
 ultraviolet light can also positively impact us.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.860
 In fact, I will describe a particular set of new results

14:45.860 --> 14:48.220
 that show that ultraviolet light

14:48.220 --> 14:51.160
 viewed for just a few minutes each day

14:51.160 --> 14:53.580
 or landing on the skin for just a few minutes each day

14:53.580 --> 14:56.460
 can actually offset a lot of pain.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.980
 It actually has the ability to reduce the amount of pain

14:59.980 --> 15:01.940
 sensed by your body and we now understand

15:01.940 --> 15:03.740
 the specific circuits in the brain and body

15:03.740 --> 15:05.180
 that allow that to happen.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.020
 I'll talk about that

15:06.020 --> 15:08.340
 and the related protocols a little bit later.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.540
 So the important thing to understand

15:09.540 --> 15:11.860
 about the physics of light is that there's energy

15:11.860 --> 15:13.300
 at all these different wavelengths.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.620
 We only see some of those wavelengths,

15:15.620 --> 15:19.020
 which basically is to say that light impacts us

15:19.020 --> 15:23.100
 at many different levels and the so-called levels

15:23.100 --> 15:26.080
 that I'm referring to are the different wavelengths of light

15:26.080 --> 15:28.140
 and you're welcome to think of the different wavelengths

15:28.140 --> 15:29.740
 of light as different colors,

15:29.740 --> 15:33.240
 but do understand that there are truly colors of light

15:33.240 --> 15:37.380
 that you and I can't see and yet that have powerful impact

15:37.380 --> 15:38.440
 on your brain and body.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.460
 Now, the third bullet point to understand

15:40.460 --> 15:41.880
 about the physics of light

15:41.880 --> 15:44.220
 is that different wavelengths of light

15:44.220 --> 15:47.900
 because of the way that their wave travels

15:47.900 --> 15:51.780
 can penetrate tissues to different depths.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.980
 This is very, very important.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.380
 Today, we're going to talk a lot about red light therapies

15:56.380 --> 15:59.940
 and near infrared light therapies.

15:59.940 --> 16:02.300
 Those are so-called longer wavelengths.

16:02.300 --> 16:06.340
 Longer wavelength, just think of a bigger, longer wave,

16:06.340 --> 16:08.660
 a bigger curve, as opposed to short wavelength light,

16:08.660 --> 16:10.780
 which is going to be shorter.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.780
 A short wavelength light would be something like blue

16:12.780 --> 16:14.720
 or green light or ultraviolet light.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.860
 Blue, green and ultraviolet light,

16:17.860 --> 16:19.640
 because it's short wavelength light,

16:19.640 --> 16:23.620
 doesn't tend to penetrate tissues very easily.

16:23.620 --> 16:25.520
 It has to do with the way that the physics of light

16:25.520 --> 16:27.780
 interacts with the physical properties of your skin

16:27.780 --> 16:29.220
 and other tissues of your body.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.260
 But basically, if you were to shine UV light

16:31.260 --> 16:33.000
 onto your arm, for instance,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.180
 it could impact the skin on the surface of the arm

16:35.180 --> 16:36.860
 and maybe some of the cells

16:36.860 --> 16:38.980
 just beneath the top layer of skin,

16:38.980 --> 16:40.880
 but it wouldn't penetrate much deeper.

16:41.860 --> 16:45.940
 Long wavelength light like red light and near infrared light

16:45.940 --> 16:49.960
 has this amazing ability to penetrate through tissues,

16:49.960 --> 16:51.300
 including your skin.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.440
 And so if we were to shine red light

16:53.440 --> 16:56.120
 or near infrared light onto your arm,

16:57.100 --> 16:59.900
 it would pass through that top layer of skin.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.460
 It might impact it a little bit,

17:01.460 --> 17:04.780
 but it could penetrate deeper into your skin,

17:04.780 --> 17:05.980
 not just to the skin layers,

17:05.980 --> 17:07.660
 but maybe even down to the bone,

17:07.660 --> 17:09.540
 maybe even down to the bone marrow.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.820
 And for many people, this will be hard to conceptualize.

17:11.820 --> 17:13.360
 You think, well, wait, I've got a skin there.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.780
 Doesn't the light just bounce off?

17:14.780 --> 17:15.940
 And the answer is no,

17:15.940 --> 17:19.540
 because of the way that long wavelength light

17:19.540 --> 17:22.500
 interacts with the absorbance properties of your skin.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.040
 Absorbance properties is just the way

17:24.040 --> 17:26.180
 that the skin takes light energy

17:26.180 --> 17:29.300
 and converts it into a different form of energy.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.780
 And your skin is not able to take long wavelength light

17:32.780 --> 17:36.340
 like red light and near infrared light and absorb it,

17:36.340 --> 17:39.620
 but the tissues deeper in your body can.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.180
 So if you shine red light or near infrared light

17:42.180 --> 17:43.500
 onto the surface of your skin,

17:43.500 --> 17:46.060
 you'll see a red glow there as a reflectance

17:46.060 --> 17:47.420
 on the surface of your skin.

17:47.420 --> 17:49.700
 But a lot of the photon energy,

17:49.700 --> 17:51.980
 the light energy in those longer wavelengths

17:51.980 --> 17:54.860
 is indeed passing through those top layers of skin

17:54.860 --> 17:56.380
 into the deeper layers of skin

17:56.380 --> 17:59.620
 and can even make it into the deep layers of your arm.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.900
 And as we start to transition from the physics of light

18:01.900 --> 18:03.920
 to the biological impacts of light,

18:04.820 --> 18:07.380
 just understanding that the different wavelengths of light

18:07.380 --> 18:09.260
 impact our tissues at different levels,

18:09.260 --> 18:10.940
 literally at different depths,

18:10.940 --> 18:12.860
 will help you better understand

18:12.860 --> 18:16.200
 how light of different colors, of different intensities,

18:16.200 --> 18:19.620
 and how long you are exposed to those colors

18:19.620 --> 18:22.340
 and intensities of light can change the way

18:22.340 --> 18:25.700
 that the cells and the organs of your body work.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.060
 And if it didn't sound weird enough

18:27.060 --> 18:29.840
 that you can pass light through particular tissues

18:29.840 --> 18:31.780
 and have them land and be absorbed

18:31.780 --> 18:34.500
 at tissues deeper in your body,

18:34.500 --> 18:37.560
 well, it turns out that different wavelengths of light

18:37.560 --> 18:40.940
 are also best absorbed by particular

18:40.940 --> 18:43.560
 so-called organelles within your cells.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.400
 What are organelles?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.280
 Organelles are the different compartments

18:46.280 --> 18:48.940
 and different functions within a given cell.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.460
 So for instance, your mitochondria,

18:50.460 --> 18:52.540
 which are responsible for generating ATP

18:52.540 --> 18:53.900
 and energy in your cells,

18:53.900 --> 18:56.980
 those exist at a particular depth,

18:56.980 --> 18:58.580
 at a particular location within a cell.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.920
 They're not all at the cell surface.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.780
 They sit somewhat deeper in the cell.

19:01.780 --> 19:05.140
 The nucleus of your individual cells contains DNA,

19:05.140 --> 19:06.620
 and that sits at a particular depth

19:06.620 --> 19:08.100
 or location within your cell.

19:09.220 --> 19:10.700
 Different wavelengths of light

19:10.700 --> 19:13.480
 not only can penetrate down into different tissues

19:13.480 --> 19:15.600
 and into different cells of your body,

19:15.600 --> 19:19.540
 but they can also penetrate and access particular organelles,

19:19.540 --> 19:22.180
 meaning mitochondria or the nucleus

19:22.180 --> 19:24.020
 or the different aspects of your cells

19:24.020 --> 19:26.400
 that are responsible for different functions.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.240
 This is exquisitely important,

19:29.240 --> 19:31.340
 and it's exquisitely powerful

19:31.340 --> 19:32.780
 because as you'll learn today,

19:32.780 --> 19:34.180
 particular wavelengths of light

19:34.180 --> 19:35.980
 can be used to stimulate the function

19:35.980 --> 19:39.000
 of particular organelles within particular cells

19:39.000 --> 19:41.540
 within particular organs of your body.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.780
 I can think of no other form of energy,

19:43.780 --> 19:47.820
 not sound, not chemical energy, so not drugs,

19:47.820 --> 19:51.720
 not food, not touch,

19:51.720 --> 19:55.700
 no form of energy that can target the particular locations

19:55.700 --> 19:59.660
 in our cells, in our organelles, in our organs,

19:59.660 --> 20:02.420
 and in our body to the extent that light can.

20:02.420 --> 20:03.420
 In other words,

20:03.420 --> 20:07.260
 if you had to imagine a real world surgical tool

20:07.260 --> 20:09.940
 by which to modulate our biology,

20:09.940 --> 20:11.620
 light would be the sharpest

20:11.620 --> 20:13.820
 and the most precise of those tools.

20:13.820 --> 20:15.280
 Now let's talk about how light is converted

20:15.280 --> 20:17.060
 into biological signals.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.620
 There are several ways in which that is accomplished,

20:19.620 --> 20:22.180
 but the fundamental thing to understand

20:22.180 --> 20:26.020
 is this notion of absorption of light energy.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.440
 Certain pigments or colors

20:30.440 --> 20:33.780
 in the thing that is receiving the light energy,

20:33.780 --> 20:37.360
 meaning the thing that the light energy lands on

20:37.360 --> 20:40.460
 are going to absorb particular wavelengths of light.

20:40.460 --> 20:43.340
 Now, I promise you that you already intuitively know

20:43.340 --> 20:44.700
 how this works.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.260
 For instance, if you were to sit outside

20:47.260 --> 20:49.060
 on a very bright sunny day

20:49.060 --> 20:52.520
 and you had a table in front of you that was metal,

20:52.520 --> 20:54.980
 you might find it hard to look down at that metal table

20:54.980 --> 20:56.900
 because it's reflecting a lot of light

20:56.900 --> 20:58.200
 of particular wavelengths.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.980
 If that table were pitch black, however,

21:01.980 --> 21:04.540
 it wouldn't reflect quite as much

21:04.540 --> 21:06.940
 and you would be able to comfortably look at it.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.860
 If that table were red, it might be somewhere in between.

21:10.860 --> 21:12.820
 If that table were green,

21:12.820 --> 21:14.700
 it would be also somewhere in between,

21:14.700 --> 21:16.540
 but let's say it were very light blue,

21:16.540 --> 21:18.980
 well, then it might reflect almost as much

21:18.980 --> 21:23.380
 as a table that were just metal or a white table surface.

21:23.380 --> 21:26.420
 So the absorbance properties of a given surface

21:26.420 --> 21:28.620
 will determine whether or not light energy goes

21:28.620 --> 21:31.100
 and stays at that location

21:31.100 --> 21:33.260
 and has an impact on that location

21:33.260 --> 21:35.220
 or whether or not it bounces off.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.720
 Every biological function of light

21:38.720 --> 21:43.040
 has to do with the absorbance or the reflectance of light

21:43.040 --> 21:46.780
 or light passing through that particular thing,

21:46.780 --> 21:49.960
 meaning that particular cell or compartment within a cell.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.520
 I'd like to make it clear how this works

21:53.520 --> 21:55.820
 by using the three primary examples

21:55.820 --> 21:58.920
 of how you take light in your environment

21:58.920 --> 22:01.620
 and convert it into biological events.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.940
 We have photoreceptors in the back of our eyes.

22:05.940 --> 22:08.660
 These photoreceptors come in two major types,

22:08.660 --> 22:10.340
 the so-called rods and the cones.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.060
 The rods are very elongated, they look like rods,

22:13.060 --> 22:15.980
 and the cones look like little triangles.

22:15.980 --> 22:20.800
 Rods and cones have within them photo pigment.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.300
 They have dark stuff that's stacked up in little layers.

22:24.300 --> 22:27.380
 Rods absorb light of essentially any wavelength.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.740
 There's some variation to that,

22:28.740 --> 22:32.020
 but let's just say rods don't care

22:32.020 --> 22:34.900
 about the different colors of light.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.700
 They will absorb light energy, photon energy.

22:37.700 --> 22:41.320
 If it's red, if it's green, if it's blue, if it's yellow,

22:41.320 --> 22:44.160
 doesn't matter as long as that light is bright enough.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.500
 And it turns out that rods are very, very sensitive.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.820
 They can detect very, very small numbers of photons.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.180
 And rods are essentially what you use

22:53.180 --> 22:55.420
 to see in very low light conditions.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.460
 We'll return more to vision later.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.940
 The cones come in three major varieties.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.980
 At least for most people who aren't colorblind,

23:02.980 --> 23:05.340
 you have so-called red cones, green cones, and blue cones,

23:05.340 --> 23:06.840
 but they're not really red, green, and blue

23:06.840 --> 23:07.940
 in the back of your eye.

23:07.940 --> 23:11.720
 They are cones that either absorb long wavelength light,

23:11.720 --> 23:15.300
 red, that absorb medium wavelength light,

23:15.300 --> 23:18.180
 green, or short wavelength light, blue.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.260
 The reason that they can absorb different wavelengths

23:22.260 --> 23:24.740
 of light is they have different photo pigments.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.900
 So much as the example I gave before,

23:26.900 --> 23:29.580
 where you have different tables outside

23:29.580 --> 23:30.740
 in the sunny environment,

23:30.740 --> 23:32.660
 and some are reflecting light more than others,

23:32.660 --> 23:35.460
 others are absorbing light more than others.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.100
 Well, so too the photoreceptors,

23:38.100 --> 23:41.700
 meaning the cones are absorbing light of different

23:41.700 --> 23:43.700
 wavelengths to different extents.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.560
 And in a absolutely incredible way,

23:46.560 --> 23:48.980
 your brain is actually able to take that information

23:48.980 --> 23:51.380
 and create this perception that we have of color.

23:51.380 --> 23:53.540
 But that's another story altogether that we'll just touch

23:53.540 --> 23:55.500
 on a little bit more later,

23:55.500 --> 23:57.040
 but that if you want to learn all about,

23:57.040 --> 23:59.840
 you can go to our episode on vision.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.760
 So that's photoreceptors in the back of your eye,

24:03.760 --> 24:07.100
 absorbing light of different wavelengths, rods and cones.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.180
 The other place of course,

24:08.180 --> 24:11.180
 where light can impact our body is on our surface,

24:11.180 --> 24:14.640
 on our skin and skin has pigment too.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.960
 We call that pigment melanin.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.840
 We have within our skin multiple cell types,

24:19.840 --> 24:21.180
 but in the top layer of skin,

24:21.180 --> 24:23.060
 which is called the epidermis,

24:23.060 --> 24:27.380
 we have keratinocytes and we have melanocytes.

24:27.380 --> 24:30.900
 And the melanocytes are the cells that create pigmentation

24:30.900 --> 24:31.740
 of the skin.

24:31.740 --> 24:35.180
 And of course there is wide variation in the degree to which

24:35.180 --> 24:37.160
 there's pigmentation of the skin,

24:37.160 --> 24:38.580
 which has to do with genetics,

24:38.580 --> 24:41.100
 also has to do with where you were born and raised,

24:41.100 --> 24:43.720
 how much light exposure you have throughout the year, right?

24:43.720 --> 24:46.200
 So people toward the equator tend to have more melanocyte

24:46.200 --> 24:49.380
 activity than people who are located at the North pole.

24:49.380 --> 24:51.260
 And of course people live at different locations

24:51.260 --> 24:52.100
 throughout the earth,

24:52.100 --> 24:53.920
 regardless of their genetic background

24:53.920 --> 24:54.860
 or where they were born.

24:54.860 --> 24:58.380
 And so, as you all know, with light exposure,

24:58.380 --> 25:02.560
 those melanocytes will turn on genetic programs

25:02.560 --> 25:05.780
 and other biological programs that lead to enhanced

25:05.780 --> 25:08.700
 pigmentation on the skin, which we call tanning.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.700
 The way they do that is by absorbing UV light specifically.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.180
 So with melanocytes,

25:14.180 --> 25:19.140
 we have a very specific example of how a pigment absorbs

25:19.140 --> 25:20.980
 light of a particular length, in this case,

25:20.980 --> 25:23.200
 ultraviolet short wavelength light,

25:23.200 --> 25:27.100
 which in turn creates a set of biological signals within

25:27.100 --> 25:30.060
 those cells that in turn creates changes in our skin

25:30.060 --> 25:31.000
 pigmentation.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.140
 So we have photoreceptors,

25:32.140 --> 25:34.420
 we have melanocytes and the third example I'd like to

25:34.420 --> 25:37.620
 provide is that of every cell of your body.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.340
 And what I mean by that is that every cell of your body,

25:40.340 --> 25:45.140
 meaning a cell that is part of your bone tissue or your bone

25:45.140 --> 25:48.760
 marrow or heart tissue or liver or spleen,

25:48.760 --> 25:51.520
 if light can access those cells,

25:51.520 --> 25:54.300
 it will change the way that those cells function for better

25:54.300 --> 25:55.340
 or for worse.

25:56.500 --> 26:01.180
 For many organs within our body that reside deep to our

26:01.180 --> 26:05.300
 skin, light never arrives at those cells.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.980
 A really good example of this that we'll touch on later is

26:07.980 --> 26:09.400
 the spleen.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.580
 Unless you have massive damage to your body surface,

26:12.580 --> 26:14.740
 unless you literally have a hole in your body,

26:14.740 --> 26:18.060
 light will never land directly on your spleen,

26:18.060 --> 26:22.460
 but the spleen still responds to light information through

26:22.460 --> 26:24.100
 indirect pathways.

26:24.100 --> 26:27.500
 And those indirect pathways arise through light arriving on

26:27.500 --> 26:30.600
 the skin and light arriving on the eyes.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.420
 So a key principle that I'm going to return to again and

26:33.420 --> 26:37.940
 again today is that the ways in which light can impact the

26:37.940 --> 26:40.600
 biology of your organelles, your cells,

26:40.600 --> 26:41.960
 your organs and the tissues,

26:41.960 --> 26:45.380
 and indeed your whole body can either be direct.

26:45.380 --> 26:46.220
 So for instance,

26:46.220 --> 26:48.900
 light onto your skin impacting skin or light onto your

26:48.900 --> 26:52.060
 photoreceptors impacting the photoreceptors of your eye,

26:52.060 --> 26:53.880
 or it can be indirect.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.900
 It can be light arriving on your photoreceptors,

26:56.900 --> 26:59.880
 the photoreceptors then informing another cell type,

26:59.880 --> 27:01.740
 which informs another cell type,

27:01.740 --> 27:04.900
 which then relays a signal and kind of a bucket brigade

27:04.900 --> 27:07.620
 manner off to the spleen and says to the spleen,

27:07.620 --> 27:10.380
 Hey, there's a lot of UV light out here.

27:10.380 --> 27:12.060
 We're actually under stress.

27:12.060 --> 27:12.900
 In fact,

27:12.900 --> 27:15.860
 there's so much UV light that you need to activate an immune

27:15.860 --> 27:18.100
 program to protect the skin.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.180
 And in response to that,

27:19.180 --> 27:21.920
 the spleen can deploy certain signals and certain cell types

27:21.920 --> 27:24.500
 to go out and start repairing skin that's being damaged by

27:24.500 --> 27:25.420
 UV light.

27:25.420 --> 27:28.380
 So we have direct signals and we have indirect signals,

27:28.380 --> 27:30.940
 but in every case,

27:30.940 --> 27:32.140
 it starts with light,

27:32.140 --> 27:36.220
 a particular wavelengths being absorbed by particular

27:36.220 --> 27:40.620
 pigments or properties of the surfaces that those light

27:40.620 --> 27:42.300
 waves land on.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.620
 And as you recall from our discussion about the physics of

27:44.620 --> 27:45.580
 light, remember,

27:45.580 --> 27:48.260
 it's not just about light impinging on the surface of your

27:48.260 --> 27:49.080
 body.

27:49.080 --> 27:53.080
 Light can actually penetrate deep to the skin and access at

27:53.080 --> 27:55.800
 least certain tissues and cells of your body.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.380
 Even though you can't see those wavelengths of light,

27:58.380 --> 28:00.980
 they are getting into you all the time.

28:00.980 --> 28:04.420
 So perhaps the best way to wrap this discussion about the

28:04.420 --> 28:08.780
 physics and the biology of light with a bit of a bow is to

28:08.780 --> 28:11.220
 think about light as a transducer,

28:11.220 --> 28:14.660
 meaning a communicator of what's going on in the environment

28:14.660 --> 28:15.720
 around you.

28:15.720 --> 28:19.120
 And that some of those signals are arriving at the surface

28:19.120 --> 28:21.220
 and impacting the surface of your body.

28:21.220 --> 28:24.200
 But many of those signals are being taken by cells at the

28:24.200 --> 28:25.800
 surface of your body,

28:25.800 --> 28:27.860
 meaning your melanocytes in your skin and the

28:27.860 --> 28:29.460
 photoreceptors of your eyes,

28:29.460 --> 28:33.600
 and then being passed off as a set of instructions to the

28:33.600 --> 28:35.740
 other organs and tissues of your body.

28:35.740 --> 28:38.940
 Light can impact our biology in very fast,

28:38.940 --> 28:41.500
 moderately fast and slow ways.

28:41.500 --> 28:45.180
 But even the slow ways in which light can impact our biology

28:45.180 --> 28:48.340
 can be very powerful and very long lasting.

28:48.340 --> 28:52.400
 Just as a quick example of the rapid effects of light on our

28:52.400 --> 28:57.340
 biology, if you were to go from a room that is dimly lit,

28:57.340 --> 29:01.060
 or dark into a very brightly lit room,

29:01.060 --> 29:04.540
 you would immediately feel very alert.

29:04.540 --> 29:05.940
 You might say, no, that's not true.

29:05.940 --> 29:09.040
 Sometimes I wake up and it's dark and I kind of stumble out

29:09.040 --> 29:10.980
 and it's lighter out in the next room.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.000
 And it takes me a while to wake up.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.980
 But if we were to move you from a room that was very dark to

29:15.980 --> 29:17.060
 very bright,

29:17.060 --> 29:20.820
 a signal conveyed from your eyes to an area of your brain

29:20.820 --> 29:24.320
 stem called the locus coeruleus would cause the release of

29:24.320 --> 29:27.480
 adrenaline similar to the release of adrenaline.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.140
 If you were to be dropped into very,

29:29.140 --> 29:30.820
 very cold water, all of a sudden,

29:30.820 --> 29:33.500
 you just an immediate wake up signal to your brain and body.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.680
 So that's an example of a rapid effect of light on your

29:36.680 --> 29:38.720
 biology, not a very typical one,

29:38.720 --> 29:41.780
 but nonetheless one that has a hardwired biological

29:41.780 --> 29:46.180
 mechanism at the other end of the spectrum or what we call

29:46.180 --> 29:49.940
 slow integrating effects of light on our biology.

29:49.940 --> 29:53.860
 So what I mean by that are ways in which your body is taking

29:53.860 --> 29:56.620
 information about light in the environment,

29:56.620 --> 29:59.720
 not in the sort of snapshot acute sense,

29:59.720 --> 30:02.500
 but averaging the amount of light in your environment.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.360
 And that average light information is changing the way that

30:06.360 --> 30:07.940
 your biology works.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.620
 But even though this is a slow process,

30:10.620 --> 30:13.460
 as I mentioned before, it's a very powerful one.

30:13.460 --> 30:16.140
 The primary example of this are so-called

30:16.140 --> 30:20.740
 circannual rhythms, circannual rhythms are literally a

30:20.740 --> 30:25.740
 calendar that exists within your body that uses not numbers,

30:26.420 --> 30:29.580
 but amounts of hormone that are released into your brain and

30:29.580 --> 30:33.700
 body each day and each night as a way of knowing where you

30:33.700 --> 30:37.520
 are in the 365 day calendar year.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.900
 Now that might seem kind of crazy, but it's not crazy.

30:40.900 --> 30:45.020
 The earth travels around the sun once every 365 days.

30:45.020 --> 30:49.100
 And depending on where you are on the earth, where you live,

30:50.220 --> 30:54.880
 you are going to get more or less light each day on average,

30:54.880 --> 30:56.520
 depending on the time of year.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.680
 So if you're in the Northern hemisphere in the winter months,

30:59.680 --> 31:02.900
 days are shorter, nights are longer.

31:02.900 --> 31:05.980
 In the summer months, days are longer, nights are shorter.

31:05.980 --> 31:09.260
 And of course things change whether or not you're in the

31:09.260 --> 31:11.660
 Northern hemisphere or the Southern hemisphere.

31:11.660 --> 31:15.140
 But nonetheless, in short days,

31:15.140 --> 31:17.840
 you have more darkness that's obvious.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.840
 And if you understand that light arriving on the eyes is

31:24.060 --> 31:27.120
 absorbed by a particular cell type called the intrinsically

31:27.120 --> 31:29.700
 photosensitive ganglion cell, it's just a name.

31:29.700 --> 31:30.620
 You don't need to know the name,

31:30.620 --> 31:32.300
 but if you want it's the so-called intrinsically

31:32.300 --> 31:33.940
 photosensitive ganglion cell also called the

31:33.940 --> 31:36.780
 melanopsin cell, because it contains an opsin,

31:36.780 --> 31:41.780
 a photo pigment that absorbs short wavelength light that

31:42.100 --> 31:43.700
 arrives through sunlight,

31:43.700 --> 31:47.460
 those cells communicate to particular stations in the brain

31:47.460 --> 31:51.660
 that in turn connect to your so-called pineal gland,

31:51.660 --> 31:53.940
 which is this little pea-sized gland in the middle of your

31:53.940 --> 31:57.620
 brain that releases a hormone called melatonin.

31:57.620 --> 32:01.020
 And the only thing you need to know is that light activates

32:01.020 --> 32:02.160
 these particular cells,

32:02.160 --> 32:04.500
 the intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells,

32:04.500 --> 32:08.580
 which in turn shuts down the production of melatonin from

32:08.580 --> 32:09.640
 the pineal gland.

32:10.980 --> 32:14.500
 If you think about this in terms of the travel of the earth

32:14.500 --> 32:16.940
 around the sun across the year,

32:16.940 --> 32:19.560
 what it means is that in short days,

32:19.560 --> 32:22.860
 because there's very little light on average landing on

32:22.860 --> 32:23.700
 these cells,

32:24.700 --> 32:28.140
 the duration of melatonin release will be much longer

32:28.140 --> 32:30.820
 because as I mentioned before light inhibits,

32:30.820 --> 32:32.540
 it shuts down melatonin.

32:32.540 --> 32:34.340
 Whereas in the summer months,

32:34.340 --> 32:37.540
 much more light on average will land on your eyes, right?

32:37.540 --> 32:38.960
 Because days are longer.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.100
 Even if you're spending more time indoors on average,

32:41.100 --> 32:45.140
 you're going to get more light to activate these cells.

32:45.140 --> 32:48.600
 And because light shuts down melatonin production,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.280
 what you'll find is that the duration of melatonin release

32:51.280 --> 32:54.380
 for the pineal is much shorter.

32:54.380 --> 32:57.460
 So melatonin is a transducer.

32:57.460 --> 33:01.060
 It's a communicator of how much light on average is in your

33:01.060 --> 33:02.960
 physical environment.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.380
 What this means is for people living in the Northern

33:06.380 --> 33:07.420
 hemisphere,

33:07.420 --> 33:10.540
 you're getting more melatonin release in the winter months

33:10.540 --> 33:12.640
 than you are in the summer months.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.640
 So you have a calendar system that is based in a hormone.

33:18.540 --> 33:22.860
 And that hormone is using light in order to determine where

33:22.860 --> 33:26.160
 you are in that journey around the sun.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.060
 Now this is beautiful.

33:27.060 --> 33:30.380
 At least to me, it's beautiful because what it means is that

33:30.380 --> 33:34.060
 the environment around us is converted into a signal that

33:34.060 --> 33:36.860
 changes the environment within us.

33:36.860 --> 33:40.900
 That signal is melatonin and melatonin is well-known for its

33:40.900 --> 33:43.740
 role in making us sleepy each night and allowing us to fall

33:43.740 --> 33:44.760
 asleep.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.200
 Many of you have probably heard before,

33:46.200 --> 33:49.380
 I am not a big fan of melatonin supplementation for a number

33:49.380 --> 33:51.260
 of reasons, but just as a quick aside,

33:52.160 --> 33:54.700
 the levels of melatonin that are in most supplements are far

33:54.700 --> 33:57.480
 too high to really be considered physiological.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.180
 They are indeed super physiological in most cases.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.900
 And melatonin can have a number of different effects,

34:02.900 --> 34:07.680
 not just related to sleep, but that's supplemented melatonin.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.820
 Here I'm talking about our natural production and release of

34:10.820 --> 34:11.660
 melatonin,

34:11.660 --> 34:15.740
 according to where we are in the 365 day calendar year.

34:17.100 --> 34:18.220
 Indogenous melatonin,

34:18.220 --> 34:20.380
 meaning the melatonin that we make within our bodies

34:20.380 --> 34:23.560
 naturally, not melatonin that's supplemented,

34:23.560 --> 34:26.760
 has two general categories of effects.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.140
 The first set of effects are so-called regulatory effects,

34:29.140 --> 34:30.900
 and the others are protective effects.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.780
 The regulatory effects are for instance,

34:32.780 --> 34:37.540
 that melatonin can positively impact bone mass.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.300
 So melatonin can, for instance,

34:39.300 --> 34:41.820
 turn on the production of osteoblasts,

34:41.820 --> 34:45.820
 which are essentially stem cells that make more bone for us

34:45.820 --> 34:47.420
 that make our bones stronger,

34:47.420 --> 34:50.040
 and that can replace damaged aspects of our bone.

34:51.060 --> 34:53.940
 Melatonin is also involved in maturation of the gonads

34:53.940 --> 34:56.860
 during puberty, the ovaries and the testes.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.100
 Although there, the effects of melatonin tend to be

34:59.100 --> 35:02.780
 suppressive on maturation of the ovaries and testes,

35:02.780 --> 35:06.820
 meaning high levels of melatonin tend to reduce testicle

35:06.820 --> 35:10.880
 volume and reduce certain functions within the testes,

35:10.880 --> 35:13.580
 including sperm production and testosterone production.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.420
 And within the ovaries,

35:15.420 --> 35:18.580
 melatonin can suppress the maturation of eggs, et cetera.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.020
 Now, I don't want anyone to get scared

35:20.020 --> 35:21.540
 if you've been taking melatonin,

35:21.540 --> 35:23.880
 mostly effects of melatonin on those functions

35:23.880 --> 35:25.180
 are reversible,

35:25.180 --> 35:27.280
 but I should point out that one of the reasons

35:27.280 --> 35:30.640
 why children don't go into puberty until a particular age

35:30.640 --> 35:32.540
 is that young children tend to have

35:32.540 --> 35:34.760
 chronically high endogenous melatonin,

35:34.760 --> 35:37.380
 and that is healthy to keep them out of puberty

35:37.380 --> 35:40.700
 until it's the right time for puberty to happen.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.400
 So melatonin can increase bone mass,

35:43.400 --> 35:46.860
 but reduces gonad mass, so to speak.

35:46.860 --> 35:48.740
 It's going to have varying effects

35:48.740 --> 35:51.460
 depending on the ratios and levels of other hormones

35:51.460 --> 35:53.220
 and other biological events in the body.

35:53.220 --> 35:55.420
 But as you can see, melatonin has these powerful

35:55.420 --> 35:57.540
 regulatory effects on other tissues.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.140
 I should also mention that melatonin

35:59.140 --> 36:02.120
 is a powerful modulator of placental development.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.500
 So for anyone that's pregnant,

36:03.500 --> 36:05.860
 if you're considering melatonin supplementation,

36:05.860 --> 36:08.540
 please, please, please talk to your OBGYN,

36:08.540 --> 36:10.980
 talk to your other doctor as well.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.380
 You want to be very, very cautious

36:12.380 --> 36:14.660
 because of the powerful effects that melatonin can have

36:14.660 --> 36:16.900
 on the developing fetus and placenta.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.020
 For people that are not pregnant, in fact, all people,

36:20.020 --> 36:23.780
 melatonin has a powerful effect on the central nervous

36:23.780 --> 36:24.980
 system as a whole.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.980
 Your brain and spinal cord are the major components

36:26.980 --> 36:28.460
 of your central nervous system.

36:28.460 --> 36:32.140
 And melatonin, because it's associated with darkness,

36:33.020 --> 36:34.340
 which is just another way of saying that

36:34.340 --> 36:38.020
 light suppresses melatonin, melatonin is thereby associated

36:38.020 --> 36:40.660
 with the dark phase of each 24 hour cycle,

36:41.800 --> 36:43.860
 it can have a number of different effects

36:44.700 --> 36:48.340
 in terms of waking up or making our body feel more sleepy.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.420
 And it does that by way of impacting cells

36:50.420 --> 36:51.460
 within our nervous system,

36:51.460 --> 36:54.040
 literally turning on certain brain areas,

36:54.040 --> 36:55.580
 turning off other brain areas.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.060
 And it does that through a whole cascade

36:57.060 --> 36:58.460
 of biological mechanisms,

36:58.460 --> 37:00.460
 a bit too detailed to get into today.

37:00.460 --> 37:03.000
 So melatonin is regulating how awake or asleep we are.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.940
 It tends to make us more asleep, incidentally.

37:05.940 --> 37:08.860
 It's regulating our timing of puberty

37:08.860 --> 37:11.300
 and it's regulating how our gonads,

37:11.300 --> 37:12.900
 the testes and ovaries function,

37:12.900 --> 37:14.780
 even in adulthood to some extent,

37:14.780 --> 37:17.420
 and it's regulating bone mass.

37:17.420 --> 37:20.480
 As I mentioned before, melatonin also has protective effects.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.160
 It can activate our immune system.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.500
 It is among the most potent antioxidants.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.140
 So it is known to have certain anti-cancer properties

37:28.140 --> 37:29.620
 and things of that sort,

37:29.620 --> 37:32.120
 which is not to say that you simply want more melatonin.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.860
 I think a lot of people get misled

37:33.860 --> 37:36.100
 when they hear something like melatonin

37:36.100 --> 37:37.960
 has anti-cancer properties.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.580
 That doesn't mean that just cranking up

37:39.580 --> 37:42.060
 the levels of melatonin by supplementing it

37:42.060 --> 37:44.540
 or by spending time in darkness and not getting any light,

37:44.540 --> 37:46.140
 which would of course inhibit melatonin

37:46.140 --> 37:48.500
 is going to be beneficial for combating cancer.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.540
 That's not the way it works.

37:50.540 --> 37:53.980
 It is actually the rise and fall of melatonin

37:53.980 --> 37:57.420
 every 24 hour cycle and the changes in the duration

37:57.420 --> 37:59.820
 of that melatonin signal throughout the seasons

37:59.820 --> 38:03.300
 that has these anti-cancer and antioxidant effects.

38:03.300 --> 38:07.100
 So when we think about light impacting our biology,

38:07.100 --> 38:08.660
 the reason I bring up melatonin

38:08.660 --> 38:10.740
 as the primary example of that is A,

38:10.740 --> 38:13.220
 because melatonin impacts so many important functions

38:13.220 --> 38:14.420
 within our brain and body,

38:14.420 --> 38:17.840
 but also because hormones in general, not always,

38:17.840 --> 38:19.240
 but in general are responsible

38:19.240 --> 38:22.660
 for the slow modulatory effects on our biology.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.780
 And so I'm using this as an example

38:24.780 --> 38:27.820
 of how light throughout the year is changing the way

38:27.820 --> 38:29.660
 that the different cells and tissues

38:29.660 --> 38:31.060
 and organs of your body are working

38:31.060 --> 38:34.300
 and that melatonin is the transducer of that signal.

38:34.300 --> 38:35.940
 So at this point we can say

38:35.940 --> 38:38.060
 light powerfully modulates melatonin,

38:38.060 --> 38:39.700
 meaning it shuts down melatonin.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.420
 Melatonin is both beneficial for certain tissues

38:42.420 --> 38:46.220
 and suppressive for other tissues and functions.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.780
 What should we do with this information?

38:47.780 --> 38:50.860
 Well, it's very well established now

38:50.860 --> 38:53.100
 that one of the best things that we can all do

38:53.100 --> 38:56.580
 is to get the proper amount of sunlight each day.

38:56.580 --> 39:00.340
 And by proper, I mean appropriate for that time of year.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.540
 So in the summer months where the days are longer

39:03.540 --> 39:04.780
 and nights are shorter,

39:04.780 --> 39:08.220
 we would all do well to get more sunlight in our eyes.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.100
 And again, it's going to be to our eyes

39:10.100 --> 39:14.220
 because as you recall, the pineal sits deep in the brain

39:14.220 --> 39:16.300
 and light can't access the pineal directly,

39:16.300 --> 39:17.820
 at least not in humans.

39:17.820 --> 39:22.620
 So in order to get light information to the pineal

39:22.620 --> 39:25.240
 and thereby get the proper levels of melatonin,

39:26.100 --> 39:27.560
 according to the time of year,

39:27.560 --> 39:30.900
 we should all try and get outside as much as possible

39:30.900 --> 39:34.140
 during the long days of summer and spring.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.340
 And in the winter months,

39:35.340 --> 39:37.700
 it makes sense to spend more time indoors.

39:37.700 --> 39:38.820
 For those of you that suffer

39:38.820 --> 39:40.180
 from seasonal affective disorder,

39:40.180 --> 39:41.460
 which is a seasonal depression

39:41.460 --> 39:44.180
 or feel low during the fall and winter months,

39:44.180 --> 39:45.300
 there are ways to offset this.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.860
 We did an entire episode on mood and circadian rhythms

39:47.860 --> 39:49.100
 where we describe this.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.480
 So it does make sense for some people

39:50.480 --> 39:52.920
 to get more bright light in their eyes early in the morning

39:52.920 --> 39:56.020
 and throughout the day during the winter months as well.

39:56.020 --> 39:59.380
 But nonetheless, changes in melatonin,

39:59.380 --> 40:02.060
 meaning changes in the duration of melatonin release

40:02.060 --> 40:04.080
 across the year are normal and healthy.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.760
 So provided that you're not suffering from depression,

40:06.760 --> 40:09.540
 it's going to be healthy to somewhat modulate your amount

40:09.540 --> 40:12.260
 of indoor and outdoor time across the year.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.240
 The other thing to understand

40:13.240 --> 40:15.040
 is this very firmly established fact,

40:15.040 --> 40:18.140
 which is light powerfully inhibits melatonin.

40:19.260 --> 40:20.980
 If you wake up in the middle of the night

40:20.980 --> 40:23.320
 and you go into the bathroom and you flip on the lights,

40:23.320 --> 40:26.500
 and those are very bright overhead fluorescent lights,

40:26.500 --> 40:28.060
 your melatonin levels,

40:28.060 --> 40:30.180
 which would ordinarily be quite high

40:30.180 --> 40:31.020
 in the middle of the night,

40:31.020 --> 40:33.820
 because you've been eyes closed in the dark presumably,

40:33.820 --> 40:37.000
 will immediately plummet to near zero or zero.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.020
 We would all do well, regardless of time of year,

40:40.020 --> 40:43.540
 to not destroy our melatonin

40:43.540 --> 40:45.380
 in the middle of the night in this way.

40:45.380 --> 40:46.940
 So if you need to get up in the middle of the night

40:46.940 --> 40:47.780
 and use the restroom,

40:47.780 --> 40:50.860
 which is a perfectly normal behavior for many people,

40:50.860 --> 40:53.940
 use the minimum amount of light required

40:53.940 --> 40:57.080
 in order to safely move through the environment

40:57.080 --> 40:58.580
 that you need to move through.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.440
 Melatonin needs to come on early in the night.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.300
 It actually starts rising in the evening and towards sleep.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.220
 But then as you close your eyes and you go to sleep,

41:08.220 --> 41:10.680
 melatonin levels are going to continue to rise,

41:10.680 --> 41:13.580
 at least for several hours into the night.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.220
 Again, if you get up in the middle of the night,

41:15.220 --> 41:17.920
 really try hard not to flip on a lot of bright lights.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.460
 If you do that every once in a while,

41:19.460 --> 41:21.020
 it's not going to be a problem.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.980
 But if you're doing that night after night,

41:22.980 --> 41:27.440
 you are really disrupting this fundamental signal

41:27.440 --> 41:28.980
 that occurs every night,

41:28.980 --> 41:31.100
 regardless of winter, spring, summer, et cetera,

41:31.100 --> 41:33.500
 and that is communicating information

41:33.500 --> 41:37.060
 about where your brain and body should be in time.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.900
 And I know that's a little bit of a tricky concept,

41:38.900 --> 41:41.860
 but really our body is not meant to function

41:41.860 --> 41:43.340
 in the same way during the winter months

41:43.340 --> 41:44.540
 as the summer months.

41:44.540 --> 41:48.020
 There are functions that are specifically optimal

41:48.020 --> 41:49.620
 for the shorter days of winter.

41:49.620 --> 41:51.780
 And there are functions that are specifically optimal

41:51.780 --> 41:53.780
 for the longer days of summer.

41:53.780 --> 41:58.520
 So again, try to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes

41:58.520 --> 41:59.560
 in the middle of the night.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.580
 And for those of you that are doing shift work,

42:01.580 --> 42:04.100
 what I can say is try and avoid getting bright light

42:04.100 --> 42:06.060
 in your eyes in the middle of your sleep cycle.

42:06.060 --> 42:07.440
 So even if you're sleeping in the middle of the day,

42:07.440 --> 42:08.740
 because you have to work at night,

42:08.740 --> 42:11.160
 if you wake up during that bout of sleep,

42:11.160 --> 42:13.360
 really try hard to limit the amount of light,

42:13.360 --> 42:15.580
 which is going to be harder for shift workers, right?

42:15.580 --> 42:17.420
 Because there are generally a lot more lights on

42:17.420 --> 42:18.620
 and bright lights outside too.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.060
 You would want to close the blinds

42:20.060 --> 42:22.380
 and limit artificial light inside.

42:22.380 --> 42:25.940
 One way to bypass some of the inhibitory effects

42:25.940 --> 42:27.420
 of light on melatonin

42:27.420 --> 42:29.980
 is to change your physical environment

42:29.980 --> 42:32.000
 by for instance, dimming the lights.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
 That's one simple way, very low cost way.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.780
 In fact, you'll save money by dimming the lights

42:35.780 --> 42:36.700
 or turning them off.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.140
 The other is if you are going to use light

42:39.140 --> 42:40.700
 using long wavelength light,

42:40.700 --> 42:42.540
 because as you recall these intrinsically

42:42.540 --> 42:45.020
 photosensitive melanopsin cells within your retina

42:45.020 --> 42:48.220
 that convey the signal about bright light

42:48.220 --> 42:50.420
 in your environment to impact melatonin,

42:50.420 --> 42:51.740
 to shut down melatonin,

42:51.740 --> 42:53.840
 respond to short wavelengths of light.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.860
 So red light is long wavelength light.

42:55.860 --> 42:57.760
 You now understand that from our discussion

42:57.760 --> 42:59.620
 about the physics of light.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.420
 And if you were to use amber colored light or red light,

43:03.420 --> 43:06.700
 and even better dim amber or dim red light

43:06.700 --> 43:07.540
 in the middle of the night,

43:07.540 --> 43:11.100
 well then you would probably not reduce melatonin at all,

43:11.100 --> 43:13.040
 unless those red lights and amber lights

43:13.040 --> 43:14.080
 are very, very bright.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.260
 Any light provided it's bright enough

43:16.260 --> 43:18.860
 will shut down melatonin production.

43:18.860 --> 43:20.900
 One final point about melatonin,

43:20.900 --> 43:23.980
 and this relates to melatonin supplementation as well,

43:23.980 --> 43:27.340
 is that now that you understand how potently melatonin

43:27.340 --> 43:29.220
 can impact things like cardiovascular function,

43:29.220 --> 43:31.160
 immune function, anticancer properties,

43:31.160 --> 43:34.340
 bone mass, gonad function, et cetera,

43:34.340 --> 43:37.500
 you can understand why it would make sense to be cautious

43:37.500 --> 43:38.980
 about melatonin supplementation,

43:38.980 --> 43:41.480
 because supplementation tends to be pretty static.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.460
 It's X number of milligrams per night.

43:44.460 --> 43:47.220
 Whereas normally endogenously,

43:47.220 --> 43:49.420
 the amount of melatonin that you're releasing each night

43:49.420 --> 43:52.140
 is changing according to time of year,

43:52.140 --> 43:54.340
 or if you happen to live in an area

43:54.340 --> 43:56.940
 where there isn't much change in day length across the year.

43:56.940 --> 43:59.140
 So for instance, if you live near the equator,

43:59.140 --> 44:00.920
 well, then your body is accustomed

44:00.920 --> 44:04.020
 to having regular amounts of melatonin each night.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.180
 When you start supplementing melatonin,

44:06.180 --> 44:09.260
 you start changing the total amount of melatonin obviously,

44:09.260 --> 44:12.240
 but you're also changing the normal rhythms

44:12.240 --> 44:14.980
 in how much melatonin is being released

44:14.980 --> 44:19.020
 into your brain and body across the 365 day calendar year.

44:19.020 --> 44:22.940
 So while I'm somebody who readily embraces supplementation

44:22.940 --> 44:26.380
 in various forms for things like sleep and focus, et cetera,

44:26.380 --> 44:30.100
 when it comes to melatonin, I'm extremely cautious.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.580
 And I think it's also one of the few examples

44:32.580 --> 44:35.820
 where a hormone is available without prescription

44:35.820 --> 44:36.660
 over the counter.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.020
 You can just go into a pharmacy or drug store,

44:38.020 --> 44:39.620
 order online this hormone,

44:39.620 --> 44:41.880
 which is known to have all these powerful effects.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.620
 So I get very, very concerned

44:43.620 --> 44:45.740
 when I hear about people taking melatonin,

44:45.740 --> 44:47.380
 especially at the levels that are present

44:47.380 --> 44:48.560
 in most supplements.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.580
 It's been recognized for a very long time.

44:50.580 --> 44:53.540
 And in fact, there are now data to support the fact

44:53.540 --> 44:56.580
 that animals of all kinds, including humans,

44:56.580 --> 44:59.860
 will seek out mates and engage in mating behavior

44:59.860 --> 45:04.140
 more frequently during the long days of spring and summer.

45:04.140 --> 45:06.820
 That's right, in seasonally breeding animals,

45:06.820 --> 45:10.860
 of course, this is the case, but in humans as well,

45:10.860 --> 45:13.780
 there is more seeking out of mates and mating behavior

45:13.780 --> 45:16.820
 in longer day times of year.

45:16.820 --> 45:19.540
 Now you could imagine at least two mechanisms

45:19.540 --> 45:21.520
 by which this occurs.

45:21.520 --> 45:25.380
 The first mechanism we could easily map to melatonin

45:25.380 --> 45:28.000
 and the fact that melatonin is suppressive

45:28.000 --> 45:31.440
 to various aspects of the so-called gonadal axis,

45:31.440 --> 45:34.020
 which is basically a fancy way of saying

45:34.020 --> 45:37.700
 that melatonin inhibits testosterone and estrogen output

45:37.700 --> 45:40.100
 from the testes and from the ovaries.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.280
 I just want to remind people that both males and females

45:42.280 --> 45:44.680
 make testosterone and estrogen,

45:44.680 --> 45:47.060
 although in different ratios typically in males versus

45:47.060 --> 45:50.560
 females, and that both testosterone and estrogen

45:50.560 --> 45:54.020
 are critical for the desire to mate

45:54.020 --> 45:55.860
 and for mating behavior.

45:55.860 --> 45:58.860
 There's a broad misconception that testosterone

45:58.860 --> 46:01.300
 is involved in mating behavior and estrogen is involved

46:01.300 --> 46:04.640
 in other behaviors, but having enough estrogen is critical

46:04.640 --> 46:07.660
 for both males and females in order to maintain the desire

46:07.660 --> 46:10.160
 to mate and indeed the ability to mate.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.740
 I discussed this on the episode on optimizing testosterone

46:13.740 --> 46:15.940
 and estrogen, so if you'd like more details on that,

46:15.940 --> 46:19.300
 please see that episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

46:19.300 --> 46:22.840
 Okay, so if melatonin is suppressive

46:22.840 --> 46:27.380
 to the so-called gonadal axis and reduces overall levels

46:27.380 --> 46:30.020
 of testosterone and estrogen in males and females,

46:30.020 --> 46:33.500
 and the light inhibits melatonin,

46:33.500 --> 46:36.720
 then when there's more light, then there's less melatonin

46:36.720 --> 46:39.540
 and a more hormone output from the gonads.

46:39.540 --> 46:41.700
 And indeed that's how the system works,

46:41.700 --> 46:43.700
 but that's not the entire story.

46:43.700 --> 46:47.280
 It turns out that there is a second so-called parallel

46:47.280 --> 46:51.180
 pathway, meaning a different biological pathway that operates

46:51.180 --> 46:55.460
 in parallel to the light suppression of melatonin pathway

46:55.460 --> 46:58.700
 that provides a basis for longer days,

46:58.700 --> 47:02.040
 inspiring more desire to mate and more mating behavior.

47:02.040 --> 47:05.220
 So if we think of the first pathway involving melatonin

47:05.220 --> 47:08.480
 as sort of a break on these reproductive hormones,

47:08.480 --> 47:11.100
 the second mechanism is more like an accelerator

47:11.100 --> 47:15.060
 on those hormones, and yet it still involves light.

47:15.060 --> 47:18.740
 As I'm about to tell you, in animals such as mice,

47:18.740 --> 47:22.340
 but also in humans, exposure to light,

47:22.340 --> 47:26.120
 in particular UV blue light, so short wavelengths of light,

47:26.120 --> 47:29.180
 can trigger increases in testosterone and estrogen

47:29.180 --> 47:30.780
 and the desire to mate.

47:30.780 --> 47:33.660
 Now what's especially important about this accelerator

47:33.660 --> 47:36.820
 on the desire to mate and mating behavior and hormones

47:36.820 --> 47:40.900
 is that it is driven by exposure to light,

47:40.900 --> 47:44.740
 but it is not the exposure of light to the eyes.

47:44.740 --> 47:48.120
 It turns out that it is the exposure of your skin

47:48.120 --> 47:51.020
 to particular wavelengths of light that is triggering

47:51.020 --> 47:54.460
 increases in the hormones, testosterone and estrogen,

47:54.460 --> 47:57.020
 leading to increased desire to mate.

47:57.020 --> 48:00.860
 As it turns out, your skin, which most of us just think of

48:00.860 --> 48:03.340
 as a way to protect the organs of our body

48:03.340 --> 48:06.300
 or something to hang clothes on or ornaments on,

48:06.300 --> 48:09.440
 if you're somebody who has earrings and so forth,

48:09.440 --> 48:12.340
 your skin is actually an endocrine organ,

48:12.340 --> 48:15.180
 meaning it is a hormone producing

48:15.180 --> 48:17.360
 and hormone influencing organ.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.660
 I promise what I'm about to tell you next

48:19.660 --> 48:22.580
 will forever change the way that you think about your skin

48:22.580 --> 48:25.760
 and light and the desire to mate

48:25.760 --> 48:28.380
 and indeed even mating behavior.

48:28.380 --> 48:30.580
 I think the results are best understood

48:30.580 --> 48:32.980
 by simply going through the primary data,

48:32.980 --> 48:35.340
 meaning the actual research on this topic.

48:35.340 --> 48:37.560
 And to do so, I'm going to review a recent paper

48:37.560 --> 48:39.980
 that was published in the journal Cell Reports,

48:39.980 --> 48:42.080
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.460
 This is a paper that came out in 2021,

48:45.380 --> 48:48.660
 entitled Skin Exposure to UVB Light

48:48.660 --> 48:53.100
 Induces a Skin Brain Gonad Axis and Sexual Behavior.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.780
 And I want to emphasize that this was a paper

48:55.780 --> 49:00.560
 that focused on mice in order to address specific mechanisms

49:00.560 --> 49:03.420
 because in mice, you can so-called knock out

49:03.420 --> 49:05.540
 particular genes, you can remove particular genes

49:05.540 --> 49:06.620
 to understand mechanism.

49:06.620 --> 49:08.140
 You just can't do that in humans

49:08.140 --> 49:09.980
 in any kind of controlled way,

49:09.980 --> 49:12.420
 at least not at this point in time.

49:12.420 --> 49:15.380
 And this study also explores humans

49:15.380 --> 49:18.280
 and looked at human subjects, both men and women.

49:19.340 --> 49:22.380
 The basic finding of this study was that

49:22.380 --> 49:26.300
 when mice or humans were exposed to UVB,

49:26.300 --> 49:27.580
 meaning ultraviolet blue light,

49:27.580 --> 49:29.140
 so short wavelength light of the sort

49:29.140 --> 49:30.980
 that comes through in sunshine,

49:30.980 --> 49:34.300
 but is also available through various artificial sources.

49:34.300 --> 49:39.180
 If they received enough exposure of that light

49:39.180 --> 49:44.100
 to their skin, there were increases in testosterone

49:44.100 --> 49:46.980
 that were observed within a very brief period of time,

49:46.980 --> 49:50.060
 also increases in the hormone estrogen.

49:50.060 --> 49:52.140
 And I should point out that the proper ratios

49:52.140 --> 49:54.500
 of estrogen and testosterone were maintained

49:54.500 --> 49:55.820
 in both males and females,

49:55.820 --> 49:58.740
 at least as far as these data indicate.

49:58.740 --> 50:03.740
 And mice tended to seek out mating more and mate more.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.580
 There were also increases in gonadal weight,

50:07.580 --> 50:11.260
 literally increases in testes size and in ovarian size

50:11.260 --> 50:14.040
 when mice were exposed to this UVB light

50:14.040 --> 50:15.500
 past a certain threshold.

50:15.500 --> 50:18.180
 Now, as I mentioned before, the study also looked at humans.

50:18.180 --> 50:21.940
 They did not look at testes size or ovarian size

50:21.940 --> 50:23.260
 in the human subjects.

50:23.260 --> 50:25.240
 However, because they are humans,

50:25.240 --> 50:28.940
 they did address the psychology of these human beings

50:28.940 --> 50:31.700
 and address whether or not they had increases in,

50:31.700 --> 50:34.800
 for instance, aggressiveness or in passionate feelings

50:34.800 --> 50:38.660
 and how their perception of other people changed

50:38.660 --> 50:42.340
 when they were getting a lot of UVB light exposure

50:42.340 --> 50:43.200
 to the skin.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.340
 So before I get into some of the more important details

50:45.340 --> 50:47.040
 of the study and how it was done

50:47.040 --> 50:49.760
 and how you can leverage this information for yourself,

50:49.760 --> 50:52.780
 if you desire, I just want to highlight

50:52.780 --> 50:55.620
 some of the basic findings overall.

50:55.620 --> 50:59.380
 UVB exposure increased these so-called sex steroid levels

50:59.380 --> 51:00.680
 in mice and humans.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.780
 The sex steroid hormones, when we say steroids,

51:03.780 --> 51:06.480
 we don't mean anabolic steroids taken exogenously.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.880
 I think when people hear the word steroids,

51:07.880 --> 51:10.640
 they always think steroid abuse or use.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.900
 Rather steroid hormones such as testosterone and estrogen

51:13.900 --> 51:18.300
 went up when mice or humans had a lot of UVB exposure

51:18.300 --> 51:19.220
 to their skin.

51:19.220 --> 51:22.780
 Second of all, UVB light exposure to the skin,

51:22.780 --> 51:24.620
 enhanced female attractiveness,

51:24.620 --> 51:27.780
 so the perceived attractiveness of females by males

51:27.780 --> 51:31.900
 and increase the receptiveness or the desire to mate

51:31.900 --> 51:33.340
 in both sexes.

51:33.340 --> 51:36.620
 UVB light exposure also changed various aspects

51:36.620 --> 51:39.020
 of female biology related to fertility,

51:39.020 --> 51:41.500
 in particular, follicle growth.

51:41.500 --> 51:45.820
 Follicle and egg maturation are well-known indices

51:45.820 --> 51:48.540
 of fertility and of course correlate

51:48.540 --> 51:51.220
 with the menstrual cycle in adult humans

51:51.220 --> 51:56.220
 and is related overall to the propensity to become pregnant.

51:56.220 --> 51:59.340
 UVB light exposure enhanced maturation of the follicle

51:59.340 --> 52:02.540
 which just meant that more healthy eggs were being produced.

52:02.540 --> 52:03.900
 These are impressive effects.

52:03.900 --> 52:06.420
 First of all, they looked at a large number of variables

52:06.420 --> 52:08.500
 in the study and the fact that they looked at mice

52:08.500 --> 52:10.140
 and humans is terrific.

52:10.140 --> 52:13.060
 I think that oftentimes we find it hard to translate data

52:13.060 --> 52:13.900
 from mice to humans.

52:13.900 --> 52:16.260
 So the fact that they looked at both in parallel

52:16.260 --> 52:17.160
 is wonderful.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.260
 In the mice and in the humans,

52:20.260 --> 52:24.500
 they established a protocol that essentially involved

52:24.500 --> 52:27.820
 exposing the skin to UV light that was equivalent

52:27.820 --> 52:31.340
 to about 20 to 30 minutes of midday sun exposure.

52:31.340 --> 52:33.060
 Now, of course, where you live in the world

52:33.060 --> 52:34.700
 will dictate whether or not that midday sun

52:34.700 --> 52:36.460
 is very, very bright and intense,

52:36.460 --> 52:39.360
 or is less bright, maybe there's cloud cover, et cetera.

52:39.360 --> 52:43.100
 But since I'm imagining that most people are interested

52:43.100 --> 52:45.700
 in the ways to increase testosterone

52:45.700 --> 52:48.840
 and or estrogen in humans and are not so much interested

52:48.840 --> 52:51.060
 in increasing testosterone in mice,

52:51.060 --> 52:52.800
 I'm going to just review what they did

52:52.800 --> 52:55.900
 in the human population or the human subjects.

52:55.900 --> 52:58.220
 What they did is they had people,

52:58.220 --> 53:00.020
 first of all, establish a baseline.

53:00.020 --> 53:01.340
 And the way they establish a baseline

53:01.340 --> 53:02.640
 was a little bit unusual,

53:02.640 --> 53:04.520
 but it will make perfect sense to you.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.940
 They had people wear long sleeves and essentially cover up

53:06.940 --> 53:08.780
 and avoid sunlight for a few days

53:08.780 --> 53:10.720
 so they could measure their baseline hormones

53:10.720 --> 53:14.700
 in the absence of getting a lot of UVB light exposure

53:14.700 --> 53:16.620
 from the sun or from other sources.

53:16.620 --> 53:18.860
 Now, of course, these people had access

53:18.860 --> 53:19.980
 to artificial lights,

53:19.980 --> 53:22.020
 but as I've pointed out on this podcast before,

53:22.020 --> 53:25.420
 it's pretty unusual that you'll get enough UVB exposure

53:25.420 --> 53:27.980
 from artificial lights throughout the day.

53:27.980 --> 53:30.660
 And in the morning, you need a lot of UVB exposure,

53:30.660 --> 53:34.060
 or we should be getting a lot of UVB exposure to our eyes

53:34.060 --> 53:36.020
 and to our face and to our skin throughout the day,

53:36.020 --> 53:37.700
 provided we're not getting sunburned.

53:37.700 --> 53:39.580
 This is actually a healthy thing for mood

53:39.580 --> 53:41.180
 and for energy throughout the day.

53:41.180 --> 53:43.900
 It's only at night, basically between the hours

53:43.900 --> 53:46.280
 of about 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.700
 that even a tiny bit of UVB exposure from artificial sources

53:49.700 --> 53:51.860
 can mess us up in terms of our sleep

53:51.860 --> 53:53.420
 and our energy levels and so on.

53:53.420 --> 53:55.860
 And that's because of the potent effect of UVB

53:55.860 --> 53:58.040
 on suppressing melatonin.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.180
 So the point here is that they establish a baseline

54:01.180 --> 54:04.180
 whereby people were getting some artificial light exposure

54:04.180 --> 54:06.660
 throughout the day, but they weren't getting outside a lot.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.340
 They weren't getting a lot of sunlight.

54:08.340 --> 54:11.700
 And then they had people receive a dose

54:11.700 --> 54:16.180
 of UVB light exposure that was about 20 to 30 minutes

54:16.180 --> 54:17.020
 outdoors.

54:17.020 --> 54:20.320
 They had people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses.

54:20.320 --> 54:21.900
 Some people wore sleeveless shirts.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.560
 They encouraged people to wear shorts.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.960
 So they were indeed wearing clothing.

54:25.960 --> 54:28.900
 They were not naked and they were wearing clothing

54:28.900 --> 54:31.420
 that was culturally and situationally appropriate,

54:31.420 --> 54:34.340
 at least for the part of the world where this study was done

54:34.340 --> 54:37.100
 and they had people do that two or three times a week.

54:37.100 --> 54:39.120
 So in terms of a protocol that you might export

54:39.120 --> 54:40.980
 from this study, basically getting outside

54:40.980 --> 54:43.320
 for about 30 minutes, two or three times a week

54:43.320 --> 54:46.260
 in a minimum of clothing and yet still

54:46.260 --> 54:48.940
 wearing enough clothing that is culturally appropriate.

54:48.940 --> 54:51.180
 They were outside, they weren't sunbathing,

54:51.180 --> 54:52.540
 flipping over on their back and front.

54:52.540 --> 54:54.720
 They were just moving about doing things they could read.

54:54.720 --> 54:57.540
 They could talk, they could go about other activities,

54:57.540 --> 54:59.540
 but they weren't wearing a broad brim hat

54:59.540 --> 55:00.540
 or a hat of any kind.

55:00.540 --> 55:03.700
 They're just getting a lot of sun exposure to their skin.

55:03.700 --> 55:07.940
 They did this for a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.

55:07.940 --> 55:10.060
 So this took several weeks, right?

55:10.060 --> 55:11.420
 It took about a month if you think about it,

55:11.420 --> 55:12.780
 two or three times per week for a total

55:12.780 --> 55:15.780
 of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.

55:15.780 --> 55:16.620
 These treatments, of course,

55:16.620 --> 55:18.380
 are just being outside in the sun.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.860
 And then they measured hormones

55:20.860 --> 55:23.180
 and they measured the psychology of these male

55:23.180 --> 55:24.920
 and female adult subjects.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.060
 Let's first look at the psychological changes

55:27.060 --> 55:28.940
 that these human subjects experienced

55:28.940 --> 55:33.060
 after getting 10 to 12 of these UVB light exposure,

55:33.060 --> 55:35.380
 outdoor and sunlight type treatments.

55:35.380 --> 55:37.080
 They did this by collecting blood samples

55:37.080 --> 55:38.380
 throughout the study.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.940
 And they saw significant increases

55:40.940 --> 55:42.700
 in the hormones beta estradiol,

55:42.700 --> 55:45.220
 which is one of the major forms of estrogen,

55:45.220 --> 55:48.420
 progesterone, another important steroid hormone,

55:48.420 --> 55:51.700
 and testosterone in both men and women.

55:51.700 --> 55:55.180
 Now, an important point is that the testosterone increases

55:55.180 --> 55:58.660
 were significantly higher in men that happened

55:58.660 --> 56:02.980
 to originate from countries that had low UV exposure

56:04.040 --> 56:05.520
 compared to individuals from countries

56:05.520 --> 56:07.940
 with high UV exposure.

56:07.940 --> 56:10.820
 Now, this ought to make sense if we understand

56:10.820 --> 56:12.660
 a little bit about how the skin functions

56:12.660 --> 56:13.980
 as an endocrine organ.

56:13.980 --> 56:17.040
 Many of you have probably heard of vitamin D3,

56:17.040 --> 56:19.680
 which is a vitamin that we all make.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.180
 Many people supplement it as well

56:21.180 --> 56:23.100
 if they need additional vitamin D3.

56:24.260 --> 56:28.800
 We all require sunlight in order to allow vitamin D3

56:28.800 --> 56:32.180
 to be synthesized and perform its roles in the body.

56:32.180 --> 56:35.100
 And it turns out that people who have darker skin

56:35.100 --> 56:39.700
 actually need more vitamin D3 and or more sunlight exposure

56:39.700 --> 56:42.180
 in order to activate that D3 pathway

56:42.180 --> 56:45.260
 than do people with paler skin.

56:45.260 --> 56:47.460
 And this should make sense to all of you,

56:47.460 --> 56:50.140
 given what you now understand about melanocytes,

56:50.140 --> 56:51.700
 that cell type that we discussed earlier,

56:51.700 --> 56:54.800
 because melanocytes have pigment within them.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.640
 And if you have darker skin,

56:56.640 --> 56:59.260
 it means that you have more melanocytes

56:59.260 --> 57:00.540
 or that you have melanocytes

57:00.540 --> 57:03.940
 that are more efficient at creating pigment.

57:03.940 --> 57:07.680
 And as a consequence, the light that lands on your skin

57:07.680 --> 57:09.380
 will be absorbed by those melanocytes

57:09.380 --> 57:12.700
 and less of it is able to impact the D3 pathway.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.020
 Whereas if you have pale skin,

57:14.020 --> 57:16.080
 more of the light that lands on your skin

57:16.080 --> 57:18.140
 can trigger the synthesis

57:18.140 --> 57:22.340
 and assist the actions of vitamin D3.

57:22.340 --> 57:23.560
 Similarly, in this study,

57:23.560 --> 57:25.740
 they found that people who had paler skin

57:25.740 --> 57:28.180
 and or who originated from countries

57:28.180 --> 57:32.260
 where they had less UVB light exposure across the year

57:32.260 --> 57:35.500
 had greater, meaning more significant increases

57:35.500 --> 57:37.900
 in testosterone overall than did people

57:37.900 --> 57:41.080
 who already were getting a lot of UVB exposure.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.820
 This led them to explore so-called seasonal changes

57:43.820 --> 57:46.400
 in testosterone that occurred normally

57:46.400 --> 57:49.660
 in the absence of any light exposure treatment.

57:49.660 --> 57:52.020
 So up until now, I've been talking about

57:52.020 --> 57:55.140
 the aspects of this study involving people getting outside

57:55.140 --> 57:57.960
 for about 20 to 30 minutes per day in sunlight

57:57.960 --> 57:59.420
 in a minimum of clothing.

57:59.420 --> 58:01.820
 There was an increase in testosterone observed

58:01.820 --> 58:03.260
 in both men and women.

58:03.260 --> 58:05.820
 The increases in testosterone were greater for people

58:05.820 --> 58:08.520
 that had paler skin than darker skin.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.220
 So the data I'm about to describe

58:10.220 --> 58:11.900
 also come from this same paper,

58:11.900 --> 58:14.360
 but do not involve 20 to 30 minute

58:14.360 --> 58:16.100
 daily sun exposure protocols.

58:16.100 --> 58:18.220
 It's simply addressing whether or not

58:18.220 --> 58:22.520
 testosterone levels change as a function of time of year.

58:23.980 --> 58:27.820
 They measure testosterone across the 12 month calendar.

58:27.820 --> 58:29.660
 This study was done on subjects living

58:29.660 --> 58:32.180
 in the Northern hemisphere for the entire year.

58:32.180 --> 58:35.500
 And so in the months of January, February, and March,

58:35.500 --> 58:38.620
 of course, the length of days is shortest

58:38.620 --> 58:41.060
 and the length of nights is longest.

58:41.060 --> 58:43.620
 And of course, in the spring and summer months,

58:43.620 --> 58:45.700
 June, July, August, September, and so on,

58:45.700 --> 58:47.660
 the days are much longer and the nights are shorter.

58:47.660 --> 58:50.600
 And what they observed was very obvious.

58:51.580 --> 58:55.380
 They observed that testosterone levels were lowest

58:55.380 --> 58:57.780
 in the winter months and were highest

58:57.780 --> 59:01.260
 in the months of June, July, August, and September.

59:01.260 --> 59:03.060
 Now, these are very important data.

59:03.060 --> 59:03.900
 At least to my knowledge,

59:03.900 --> 59:06.840
 these are the first data systematically exploring

59:06.840 --> 59:09.960
 the levels of sex steroid hormones in humans

59:09.960 --> 59:13.420
 as a function of time of year and thereby as a function

59:13.420 --> 59:15.960
 of how much sunlight exposure they're getting.

59:15.960 --> 59:17.900
 And what's remarkable about these data

59:17.900 --> 59:20.640
 is that they map very well to the data in mice

59:20.640 --> 59:23.560
 and the other data in this paper on humans,

59:23.560 --> 59:28.000
 which illustrate that if you're getting more UVB exposure,

59:28.000 --> 59:29.780
 your testosterone levels are higher.

59:29.780 --> 59:31.060
 This study went a step further

59:31.060 --> 59:33.740
 and explored whether or not the amount of sunlight exposure

59:33.740 --> 59:36.060
 that one is getting to their skin influences

59:36.060 --> 59:38.740
 their psychology in terms of whether

59:38.740 --> 59:41.560
 or not they have increased desire to mate and so on.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.940
 It's well known that sunlight exposure

59:43.940 --> 59:46.760
 to the eyes can increase mood.

59:46.760 --> 59:49.040
 And I talked about this in the podcast episode

59:49.040 --> 59:50.980
 with my guest, Dr. Samir Hatar,

59:50.980 --> 59:52.740
 who's the director of the Chronobiology Unit

59:52.740 --> 59:54.380
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health.

59:54.380 --> 59:56.260
 And Samir's recommendation is that people get

59:56.260 --> 59:58.800
 as much bright light exposure as they safely can

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.180
 in the morning and throughout the day

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:02.420
 for sake of both sleep and energy,

1:00:02.420 --> 1:00:06.860
 but also for enhancing mood and regulating appetite.

1:00:06.860 --> 1:00:11.040
 In this study, it was found that both males and females

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.340
 had higher levels of romantic passion

1:00:13.340 --> 1:00:16.140
 after getting the UV treatment.

1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:18.740
 In fact, some of them reported increases in romantic passion

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:21.500
 from just one or two of these UV treatments.

1:00:21.500 --> 1:00:24.160
 So they didn't have to go through all 10 or 12

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.960
 in order to get a statistically significant increase

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:28.400
 in passion.

1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:30.020
 Now, when we talk about passion,

1:00:30.020 --> 1:00:31.980
 as the authors of this paper acknowledge,

1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:32.940
 there's really two forms.

1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:34.640
 There is emotional and sexual,

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:36.380
 and they parse this pretty finely.

1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:37.900
 I don't want to go into all the details

1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:39.740
 and we can provide a reference and link to this study

1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:41.740
 if you'd like to look at those details.

1:00:41.740 --> 1:00:45.100
 But what they found was that women receiving

1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:49.500
 this UVB light exposure focused more on increases

1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:51.740
 in physical arousal and sexual passion.

1:00:51.740 --> 1:00:53.700
 Whereas the men actually scored higher

1:00:53.700 --> 1:00:55.580
 on the cognitive dimensions of passion,

1:00:55.580 --> 1:00:58.220
 such as obsessive thoughts about their partner and so on.

1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:02.220
 Regardless, both males and females experienced

1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:05.420
 and reported a increase in sexual passion

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:06.880
 and desire to mate.

1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:08.620
 And we now know there were increases

1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:10.500
 in testosterone and estrogen,

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:13.180
 which of course could be driving the psychological changes.

1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:15.820
 Although I'm sure that those interact in both directions,

1:01:15.820 --> 1:01:19.380
 meaning the hormones no doubt affect psychology

1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:21.200
 and no doubt the psychology,

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:22.940
 these changes in passionate feelings,

1:01:22.940 --> 1:01:25.420
 no doubt also increased or changed

1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:26.920
 the hormone levels as well.

1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:30.620
 And I want to reemphasize that there was a component

1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:33.620
 of the study that had no deliberate daylight,

1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:36.340
 sunlight exposure for 20 or 30 minutes,

1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:38.500
 but rather just looked at hormone levels

1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:42.420
 throughout the year and found that the increase

1:01:42.420 --> 1:01:45.420
 in day length correlated with increases

1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:47.420
 in testosterone and sexual passion.

1:01:47.420 --> 1:01:50.140
 Now, my opinion, this is a very noteworthy study

1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:53.740
 because it really illustrates that sunlight

1:01:53.740 --> 1:01:56.420
 and day length can impact the melatonin pathway

1:01:56.420 --> 1:02:00.580
 and thereby take the foot off the brake, so to speak,

1:02:00.580 --> 1:02:03.980
 on testosterone, estrogen, and the desire to mate.

1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:08.220
 It also emphasizes that sunlight, UVB light,

1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:11.360
 can directly trigger hormone pathways

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:14.100
 and desire to mate and mating behavior.

1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:15.480
 Now, the study went a step further

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.500
 in defining the precise mechanism

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.740
 by which light can impact all these hormones

1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:21.540
 and this desire to mate.

1:02:21.540 --> 1:02:23.660
 And here, understanding the mechanism is key

1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:26.140
 if you want to export a particular protocol

1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:27.800
 or tool that you might apply.

1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:31.720
 We talked earlier about how UVB light exposure

1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:33.360
 to the eyes triggers activation

1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:35.620
 of these particular neurons within the eye

1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:37.940
 and then with centers deeper in the brain

1:02:37.940 --> 1:02:39.780
 and eventually the pineal gland

1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:42.140
 to suppress the output of melatonin

1:02:42.140 --> 1:02:45.040
 and thereby to allow testosterone and estrogen

1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:46.180
 to exist at higher levels

1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:50.580
 because melatonin can inhibit testosterone and estrogen.

1:02:50.580 --> 1:02:54.100
 In this study, they were able to very clearly establish

1:02:54.100 --> 1:02:57.460
 that it is sunlight exposure to our skin

1:02:57.460 --> 1:02:59.440
 that is causing these hormone increases

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:02.120
 that they observed in mice and humans.

1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:03.580
 And the way they did that

1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:06.640
 was to use the so-called knockout technology,

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.700
 the ability to remove specific genes

1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:11.100
 within specific tissues of the body.

1:03:11.100 --> 1:03:13.620
 And what they found is that UVB light,

1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:18.000
 meaning sunlight exposed skin upregulated,

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.980
 meaning increased the activity of something called P53,

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:24.020
 which is involved in the maturation of cells

1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:25.980
 and various aspects of cellular function.

1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:29.840
 And the cells they were focused on were the keratinocytes,

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.540
 which you are now familiar with from our earlier discussion

1:03:32.540 --> 1:03:35.100
 about the fact that the epidermis of your skin

1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:37.980
 contains mainly keratinocytes and melanocytes.

1:03:38.900 --> 1:03:43.020
 Sunlight exposure increased P53 activity in the skin

1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:46.220
 and P53 activity was required

1:03:46.220 --> 1:03:49.420
 for the downstream increases in ovarian size,

1:03:49.420 --> 1:03:53.660
 in testicular size, in testosterone increases,

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:55.540
 in the estrogen increases

1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:58.460
 and the various other changes that they observed

1:03:58.460 --> 1:03:59.980
 at the physiological level

1:03:59.980 --> 1:04:03.060
 when animals or humans were exposed to sunlight.

1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:04.060
 So these data are important

1:04:04.060 --> 1:04:06.920
 because what they mean is that not only is it important

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:09.820
 that we get sunlight exposure early in the day

1:04:09.820 --> 1:04:11.660
 and throughout the day to our eyes,

1:04:11.660 --> 1:04:14.000
 at least as much as is safely possible,

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.700
 but that we also need to get UVB sunlight exposure

1:04:16.700 --> 1:04:21.020
 onto our skin if we want to activate this P53 pathway

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:25.660
 in keratinocytes and the testosterone and estrogen increases

1:04:25.660 --> 1:04:28.380
 that are downstream of that P53 pathway.

1:04:28.380 --> 1:04:33.220
 So even though the gene knockout studies were done on mice,

1:04:33.220 --> 1:04:36.580
 they clearly show that if you remove P53 from the skin,

1:04:36.580 --> 1:04:39.220
 that these effects simply do not occur.

1:04:39.220 --> 1:04:41.620
 So in terms of thinking about a protocol

1:04:41.620 --> 1:04:43.540
 to increase testosterone and estrogen,

1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:45.860
 mood and feelings of passion,

1:04:45.860 --> 1:04:48.420
 the idea is that you would want to get

1:04:48.420 --> 1:04:52.620
 this two to three exposures per week minimum

1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:55.460
 of 20 to 30 minutes of sunlight exposure

1:04:55.460 --> 1:04:57.440
 onto as much of your body

1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:00.380
 as you can reasonably expose it to.

1:05:00.380 --> 1:05:02.020
 And when I say reasonably, I mean,

1:05:02.020 --> 1:05:04.360
 of course you have to obey cultural constraints,

1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:06.260
 decency constraints,

1:05:06.260 --> 1:05:08.660
 and of course you have to also obey the fact

1:05:08.660 --> 1:05:10.620
 that sunlight can burn your skin.

1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:13.020
 So many people are probably going to ask

1:05:13.020 --> 1:05:15.980
 what happens if you wear sunscreen?

1:05:15.980 --> 1:05:19.700
 In theory, because sunscreen has UV protection,

1:05:19.700 --> 1:05:21.860
 it would block some of these effects.

1:05:21.860 --> 1:05:23.060
 Now I'm not suggesting that people

1:05:23.060 --> 1:05:24.540
 do away with sunscreen entirely.

1:05:24.540 --> 1:05:27.140
 I do hope to do an episode all about sunscreen

1:05:27.140 --> 1:05:29.000
 in the future because sunscreen

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.960
 is a bit of a controversial topic.

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.700
 Skin cancers are a real thing

1:05:32.700 --> 1:05:35.620
 and many people are especially prone to skin cancer.

1:05:35.620 --> 1:05:37.540
 So you need to take that seriously.

1:05:37.540 --> 1:05:39.800
 Some people are not very prone to skin cancers

1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:42.620
 and can tolerate much more sun exposure.

1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:44.460
 You're probably familiar with the simple fact

1:05:44.460 --> 1:05:47.900
 that if you've gone outside on the beach with friends,

1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:49.940
 some people get burned very easily, others don't.

1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:52.440
 So you really should prioritize the health

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:54.820
 and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin.

1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:58.740
 However, these data and other data point to the fact

1:05:58.740 --> 1:06:01.500
 that we should all probably be striving

1:06:01.500 --> 1:06:04.180
 to get more sunlight exposure onto our skin

1:06:04.180 --> 1:06:05.660
 during the winter months

1:06:05.660 --> 1:06:08.940
 and still getting sunlight exposure onto our skin

1:06:08.940 --> 1:06:10.020
 in the summer months,

1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:12.740
 provided we can do that without damaging our skin.

1:06:12.740 --> 1:06:15.660
 Another set of very impressive effects of UVB light,

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:16.740
 whether or not it comes from sunlight

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:20.660
 or from an artificial source is the effect of UVB light

1:06:20.660 --> 1:06:22.400
 on our tolerance for pain.

1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:24.320
 It turns out that our tolerance for pain

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:27.900
 varies across the year and that our pain tolerance

1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:32.140
 is increased in longer day conditions.

1:06:32.140 --> 1:06:35.660
 And as we saw with the effects of UVB on hormones

1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:40.660
 and mating, again, this is occurring via UVB exposure

1:06:41.340 --> 1:06:45.120
 to the skin and UVB exposure to the eyes.

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:46.700
 I want to just describe two studies

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:49.500
 that really capture the essence of these results.

1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:52.500
 I'm going to discuss these in kind of a top contour fashion.

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:54.220
 I won't go into it as quite as much depth

1:06:54.220 --> 1:06:55.420
 as I did the last study,

1:06:55.420 --> 1:06:57.980
 but I will provide links to these studies as well.

1:06:58.980 --> 1:07:03.540
 The first study is entitled skin exposure to ultraviolet B

1:07:03.540 --> 1:07:05.800
 rapidly activate systemic neuroendocrine

1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:07.500
 and immunosuppressive responses.

1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:08.400
 And you might hear that and think,

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:09.860
 oh, immunosuppressive, that's bad.

1:07:09.860 --> 1:07:12.860
 But basically what they observed is that

1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:16.200
 even one exposure to UVB light

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:18.440
 changed the output of particular hormones

1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:20.060
 and neurochemicals in the body,

1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:23.620
 such as corticotropin hormone and beta endorphins,

1:07:23.620 --> 1:07:25.700
 which are these endogenous opioids.

1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:27.300
 We've all heard of the opioid crisis,

1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:29.460
 which is people getting addicted to opioids

1:07:29.460 --> 1:07:32.780
 that they are taking in drug form, pharmaceuticals.

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:35.040
 But here I'm referring to endorphins

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:37.520
 that our body naturally manufactures and releases

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:39.100
 in order to counter pain

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:44.080
 and act as a somewhat of a psychological soother also,

1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:46.360
 because of course, physical pain and emotional pain

1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:48.700
 are intimately linked in the brain and body.

1:07:48.700 --> 1:07:51.940
 What they found was that exposure to UVB light

1:07:51.940 --> 1:07:55.040
 increased the release of these beta endorphins.

1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:56.600
 It caused essentially the release

1:07:56.600 --> 1:07:59.380
 of an endogenous pain killer.

1:07:59.380 --> 1:08:03.000
 Now, a second study that came out very recently,

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.780
 just this last week, in fact,

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:06.020
 published in the journal Neuron,

1:08:06.020 --> 1:08:08.260
 cell press journal, excellent journal,

1:08:08.260 --> 1:08:10.240
 is entitled a visual circuit related

1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:12.380
 to the periaqueductal gray area

1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:15.300
 for the anti-nociceptive effects of bright light treatment.

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:17.980
 I'll translate a little bit of that for you.

1:08:17.980 --> 1:08:21.620
 The periaqueductal gray is a region of the midbrain

1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:24.140
 that contains a lot of neurons

1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:26.840
 that can release endogenous opioids,

1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:28.940
 things like beta enkephalin,

1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:32.220
 things like enkephalin, things like mu opioid.

1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:34.320
 These are all names of chemicals

1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:35.640
 that your body can manufacture

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:37.620
 that act as endogenous painkillers

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:39.480
 and increase your tolerance for pain.

1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:41.900
 They actually make you feel less pain overall

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:45.360
 by shutting down some of the neurons that perceive pain

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.660
 or by reducing their activity, not to a dangerous level.

1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:50.140
 They're not going to block the pain response

1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:52.620
 so that you burn yourself unnecessarily

1:08:52.620 --> 1:08:54.140
 or harm yourself unnecessarily,

1:08:54.140 --> 1:08:58.980
 but they act as a bit of a painkiller from the inside.

1:08:58.980 --> 1:09:01.260
 If you heard the word anti-nociceptive,

1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:05.180
 nociception is basically the perception

1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:09.420
 or the way in which neurons respond to painful stimuli.

1:09:09.420 --> 1:09:11.700
 So you can think of nociceptive events

1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:14.060
 in your nervous system as painful events.

1:09:14.060 --> 1:09:15.720
 And there I'm using a broad brush.

1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:17.620
 I realized that the experts in pain will say,

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:20.460
 oh, it's not a really a pain circuit, et cetera, et cetera.

1:09:20.460 --> 1:09:22.860
 But for sake of today's discussion,

1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:26.500
 it's fair to say that nociception is the perception of pain.

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:29.140
 So if this title is a visual circuit

1:09:29.140 --> 1:09:31.340
 related to the periaqueductal gray,

1:09:31.340 --> 1:09:34.220
 which is this area that releases these endogenous opioids

1:09:34.220 --> 1:09:35.580
 for the anti-nociceptive,

1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:38.360
 the anti-pain effects of bright light treatment.

1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:41.540
 The key finding of this study

1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:45.220
 is that it is light landing on the eyes

1:09:45.220 --> 1:09:48.080
 and captured by the specific cells

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:48.980
 I was talking about earlier,

1:09:48.980 --> 1:09:52.220
 those intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin ganglion cells

1:09:52.220 --> 1:09:53.060
 is the long name for them,

1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:54.920
 but these particular neurons in your eye

1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:57.280
 and in my eye incidentally,

1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:00.580
 that communicate with particular brain areas.

1:10:00.580 --> 1:10:01.720
 These brain areas have names.

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:04.220
 If you want to know them for you aficionados

1:10:04.220 --> 1:10:05.740
 or for you ultra curious folks,

1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:08.100
 they have names like the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.580
 and the inter geniculate leaflet.

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:10.780
 The names don't matter.

1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:13.380
 The point is that light landing on the eyes

1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:16.700
 is captured by these melanopsin cells.

1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:18.020
 They absorb that light,

1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:20.220
 translate that light into electrical signals

1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:22.000
 that are handed off to areas of the brain,

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.460
 such as the ventral geniculate.

1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:27.640
 And then the ventral geniculate communicates

1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:30.280
 with this periaqueductal gray area

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:33.940
 to evoke the release of these endogenous opioids

1:10:33.940 --> 1:10:37.980
 that soothe you and lead to less perception of pain.

1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:39.380
 This is a really important study

1:10:39.380 --> 1:10:43.340
 because it's long been known that in longer days

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:44.620
 or in bright light environments,

1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:47.360
 we tolerate emotional and physical pain better.

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:49.980
 Previous studies had shown

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:53.000
 that it is light landing on our skin

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.340
 that mediates that effect,

1:10:54.340 --> 1:10:55.460
 but only in part.

1:10:55.460 --> 1:10:57.400
 It couldn't explain the entire effect.

1:10:57.400 --> 1:10:59.380
 This very recent study indicates

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:02.380
 that it's also light arriving at the eyes.

1:11:02.380 --> 1:11:04.700
 And in this case, again, UVB light,

1:11:04.700 --> 1:11:08.380
 ultraviolet blue light of the sort that comes from sunlight

1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:10.980
 that is triggering these anti pain

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:12.700
 or pain relieving pathways.

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:15.180
 So once again, we have two parallel pathways.

1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:16.300
 This is a theme you're going to hear

1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:18.220
 over and over and over again,

1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:19.380
 not just in this episode,

1:11:19.380 --> 1:11:21.460
 but in all episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:11:21.460 --> 1:11:24.760
 because this is the way that your brain and body are built.

1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:27.940
 Nature rarely relies on one mechanism

1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:30.180
 in order to create an important phenomenon

1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:32.420
 and pain relief is an important phenomenon.

1:11:32.420 --> 1:11:34.380
 So we now have at least two examples

1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:37.960
 of the potent effects of UVB light exposure

1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:39.580
 to the skin and to the eyes.

1:11:39.580 --> 1:11:44.260
 One involving activation of testosterone

1:11:44.260 --> 1:11:46.340
 and estrogen pathways as it relates to mating

1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:49.540
 and another that relates to reducing

1:11:49.540 --> 1:11:51.620
 the total amount of pain that we experience

1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:54.200
 in response to any painful stimuli.

1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:57.140
 So for those of you that are thinking tools and protocols,

1:11:57.140 --> 1:12:00.120
 if you're somebody who's experiencing chronic pain,

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:01.760
 provided you can do it safely,

1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:06.180
 try to get some UVB exposure, ideally from sunlight.

1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:07.920
 I think the 20 to 30 minute protocol

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:10.520
 two or three times per week is an excellent one.

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:14.300
 It seems like a fairly low dose of UVB light exposure.

1:12:14.300 --> 1:12:17.340
 It's hard to imagine getting much damage to the skin.

1:12:17.340 --> 1:12:19.740
 Of course, if you have very sensitive skin,

1:12:19.740 --> 1:12:22.040
 or if you live in an area of the world

1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:25.420
 that is very, very bright and has intense sunlight

1:12:25.420 --> 1:12:27.820
 particular times of year, you'll want to be cautious.

1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:30.460
 Heed the warnings and considerations about sunscreen

1:12:30.460 --> 1:12:32.860
 that I talked about earlier or about wearing a hat.

1:12:32.860 --> 1:12:34.860
 But the point is very clear.

1:12:34.860 --> 1:12:38.260
 Most of us should be getting more UVB exposure

1:12:38.260 --> 1:12:39.120
 from sunlight.

1:12:40.100 --> 1:12:42.540
 I can already hear the screams within the comments

1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:44.620
 or rather the questions within the comments saying,

1:12:44.620 --> 1:12:46.220
 well, what if I live in a part of the world

1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:48.760
 where I don't get much UVB exposure?

1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:51.340
 And I want to emphasize something that I've also emphasized

1:12:51.340 --> 1:12:53.140
 in the many discussions on this podcast

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:55.460
 related to sleep and circadian rhythms and alertness,

1:12:55.460 --> 1:12:59.380
 which is even on a cloud covered day,

1:12:59.380 --> 1:13:01.940
 you are going to get far more light energy,

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:04.960
 photons through cloud cover,

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:08.140
 than you are going to get from an indoor light source,

1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.140
 an artificial light source.

1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:12.700
 I can't emphasize this enough.

1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:14.060
 If you look outside in the morning

1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:16.100
 and you see some sunlight,

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:17.740
 if you see some sunlight throughout the day,

1:13:17.740 --> 1:13:20.380
 you would do yourself a great favor

1:13:20.380 --> 1:13:22.120
 to try and chase some of that sunlight

1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:24.100
 and get into that sunlight,

1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:27.020
 to expose your eyes and your skin to that sunlight

1:13:27.020 --> 1:13:28.140
 as much as you safely can.

1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:30.580
 And when I say as much as you safely can,

1:13:30.580 --> 1:13:33.020
 never ever look at any light, artificial sunlight

1:13:33.020 --> 1:13:35.300
 or otherwise that's so bright that it's painful to look at.

1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:37.080
 It's fine to get that light arriving

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:38.820
 on your eyes indirectly.

1:13:38.820 --> 1:13:41.340
 It's fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.

1:13:41.340 --> 1:13:43.540
 In fact, if you think about the biology of the eye

1:13:43.540 --> 1:13:45.100
 and the way that those lenses work,

1:13:45.100 --> 1:13:47.480
 that it will just serve to focus that light

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:50.740
 on to the very cells that you want those light beams

1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:51.900
 to be delivered to.

1:13:51.900 --> 1:13:54.180
 Whereas sunglasses that are highly reflective

1:13:54.180 --> 1:13:56.020
 or trying to get your sunlight exposure

1:13:56.020 --> 1:13:59.100
 through a windshield of a car or through a window

1:13:59.100 --> 1:14:00.940
 simply won't work.

1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:02.060
 I'm sorry to tell you,

1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:06.220
 but most windows are designed to filter out the UVB light.

1:14:06.220 --> 1:14:09.020
 And if you're somebody who's really keen on blue blockers

1:14:09.020 --> 1:14:11.000
 and you're wearing your blue blockers all day,

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.020
 well, don't wear them outside.

1:14:13.020 --> 1:14:15.900
 And in fact, you're probably doing yourself a disservice

1:14:15.900 --> 1:14:18.260
 by wearing them in the morning and in the daytime.

1:14:18.260 --> 1:14:20.100
 There certainly is a place for blue blockers

1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:21.300
 in the evening and nighttime,

1:14:21.300 --> 1:14:24.140
 if you're having issues with falling and staying asleep.

1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:26.020
 But if you think about it, blue blockers,

1:14:26.020 --> 1:14:26.860
 what they're really doing

1:14:26.860 --> 1:14:30.900
 is blocking those short wavelength UVB wavelengths of light

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:33.820
 that you so desperately need to arrive at your retina

1:14:33.820 --> 1:14:35.940
 and of course also onto your skin

1:14:35.940 --> 1:14:38.620
 in order to get these powerful biological effects

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:40.680
 on hormones and on pain reduction.

1:14:42.060 --> 1:14:44.340
 And in terms of skin exposure,

1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:46.540
 these data also might make you think a little bit

1:14:46.540 --> 1:14:48.120
 about whether or not you should wear short sleeves

1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:50.380
 or long sleeves, whether or not you want to wear shorts

1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:51.780
 or a skirt or pants.

1:14:51.780 --> 1:14:53.920
 It's all going to depend on the context of your life

1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:57.020
 and the social and other variables that are important.

1:14:57.020 --> 1:14:59.580
 Of course, I don't know each and every one

1:14:59.580 --> 1:15:00.540
 of your circumstances,

1:15:00.540 --> 1:15:05.440
 so I can't tell you to do X or Y or Z, nor would I,

1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:07.180
 but you might take into consideration

1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:10.280
 that it is the total amount of skin exposure

1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:14.180
 that is going to allow you to capture more or fewer photons,

1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:16.180
 depending on, for instance,

1:15:16.180 --> 1:15:17.980
 if you're completely cloaked in clothing

1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:21.420
 and you're just exposed in the hands, neck and face,

1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:22.620
 such as I am now,

1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:25.100
 or whether or not you're outside in shorts and a t-shirt,

1:15:25.100 --> 1:15:28.340
 you're going to get very, very different patterns

1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:30.800
 of biological signaling activation

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.180
 in those two circumstances.

1:15:32.180 --> 1:15:33.900
 Many of you I'm guessing are wondering

1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:37.140
 whether or not you should seek out UVB exposure

1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:39.620
 throughout the entire year or only in the summer months.

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:42.300
 And that's sort of going to depend on whether or not

1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:46.480
 you experience depression in the winter months,

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:48.900
 so-called seasonal affective disorder.

1:15:48.900 --> 1:15:49.860
 Some people have mild,

1:15:49.860 --> 1:15:51.160
 some people have severe forms

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:52.260
 of seasonal affective disorder.

1:15:52.260 --> 1:15:55.140
 Some people love the fall and winter and the shorter days.

1:15:55.140 --> 1:15:56.880
 They love bundling up, they love the leaves,

1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:58.180
 they love the snow, they love the cold,

1:15:58.180 --> 1:16:00.140
 and they don't experience those psychological lows.

1:16:00.140 --> 1:16:01.920
 So it varies tremendously.

1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:03.820
 And there are genetic differences

1:16:03.820 --> 1:16:07.780
 and birthplace origin differences that relate to all this,

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:11.100
 but really it has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

1:16:12.620 --> 1:16:14.060
 I personally believe,

1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:17.440
 and this was reinforced by the director

1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:19.020
 of the Chronobiology Unit

1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:21.580
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health, Samir Hattar,

1:16:21.580 --> 1:16:25.080
 that we would all do well to get more UVB exposure

1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:27.740
 from sunlight throughout the entire year,

1:16:27.740 --> 1:16:29.220
 provided we aren't burning our skin

1:16:29.220 --> 1:16:31.380
 or damaging our eyes in some way.

1:16:31.380 --> 1:16:34.780
 In addition to that, during the winter months,

1:16:34.780 --> 1:16:38.020
 if you do experience some drop in energy

1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:42.980
 or increase in depression or psychological lows,

1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:47.460
 it can be very beneficial to access a sad lamp,

1:16:47.460 --> 1:16:49.300
 or if you don't want to buy a sad lamp,

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:51.220
 because oftentimes they can be very expensive,

1:16:51.220 --> 1:16:55.080
 you might do well to simply get a LED lighting panel.

1:16:55.080 --> 1:16:56.460
 I've described one before,

1:16:56.460 --> 1:16:59.340
 and I want to emphasize that I have no affiliation

1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:01.820
 whatsoever to these commercial sources,

1:17:01.820 --> 1:17:03.680
 but I've described one before and I'll describe it again,

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.140
 and we can provide a link to a couple of examples of these

1:17:06.140 --> 1:17:09.420
 in the show note captions, excuse me.

1:17:09.420 --> 1:17:14.420
 This is a 932,000 lux L-U-X light source

1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:16.340
 that's designed for drawing.

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:17.700
 It's literally a drawing box.

1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:18.540
 It's a thin panel.

1:17:18.540 --> 1:17:20.460
 It's about the size of a laptop.

1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:22.700
 Very inexpensive compared to the typical sad lamp.

1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:25.500
 I actually have one that I position on my desk all day long.

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:27.740
 I also happen to have skylights above my desk.

1:17:27.740 --> 1:17:29.860
 I'm fairly sensitive to the effects of light.

1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:30.700
 So in longer days,

1:17:30.700 --> 1:17:32.180
 I feel much better than I do in shorter days.

1:17:32.180 --> 1:17:33.740
 I've never suffered from full-blown

1:17:33.740 --> 1:17:35.140
 seasonal affective disorder,

1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:38.680
 but I keep that light source on throughout the day,

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:39.660
 throughout the year.

1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:41.500
 But I also make it a point to get outside

1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:42.780
 and get sunlight early in the morning

1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:44.540
 and several times throughout the day.

1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:47.220
 And if it's particularly overcast outside,

1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:49.640
 or there just doesn't seem to be a lot of sunlight

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:50.920
 coming through those clouds,

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:53.500
 I will try to look at that light source

1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:54.840
 a little bit more each day

1:17:54.840 --> 1:17:57.380
 in order to trigger these mechanisms.

1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:00.140
 Now, some people may desire to get UVB exposure

1:18:00.140 --> 1:18:01.140
 to their skin,

1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:02.740
 and they want to do that through sources

1:18:02.740 --> 1:18:03.980
 other than sunlight.

1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:06.100
 And there, it's a little bit more complicated.

1:18:06.100 --> 1:18:08.280
 There are, of course, canning salons,

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:10.660
 which basically are beds of UVB light.

1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:12.140
 That's really all they are.

1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:13.100
 I've never been to one.

1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:14.580
 I know people do frequent them

1:18:14.580 --> 1:18:16.180
 in certain parts of the world.

1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:19.260
 There, of course, people are covering their eyes.

1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:21.740
 They are only getting UVB exposure to their skin typically

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.780
 because the UVB exposure,

1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:26.500
 or intensities rather, tends to be very, very high.

1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:27.880
 And so you can actually damage your eyes

1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:29.900
 if you're looking at a very, very bright

1:18:29.900 --> 1:18:32.500
 artificial UVB source up close.

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:35.140
 So you really have to explore these options for yourself.

1:18:35.140 --> 1:18:37.120
 Sunlight, of course, being the original

1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:40.740
 and still the best way to get UVB exposure.

1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:43.320
 So without knowing your particular circumstances,

1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:47.340
 finances, genetics, or place of origin, et cetera,

1:18:47.340 --> 1:18:48.540
 I can't know whether or not

1:18:48.540 --> 1:18:49.860
 you need to use artificial sources.

1:18:49.860 --> 1:18:51.620
 You're going to have to gauge that.

1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:54.420
 Meanwhile, getting outside,

1:18:54.420 --> 1:18:59.300
 looking at and getting some exposure of UVB onto your skin

1:18:59.300 --> 1:19:00.500
 is going to be beneficial

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:03.340
 for the vast majority of people out there.

1:19:03.340 --> 1:19:05.460
 And in fact, it's even going to be beneficial

1:19:05.460 --> 1:19:07.100
 for people that are blind.

1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:10.720
 People that are blind provided they still have eyes

1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:14.180
 often maintain these melanopsin cells.

1:19:14.180 --> 1:19:16.220
 So even if you're low vision or no vision,

1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:19.480
 getting UVB exposure to your eyes can be very beneficial

1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:22.220
 for sake of mood, hormone pathways,

1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:24.380
 pain reduction, and so forth.

1:19:24.380 --> 1:19:28.820
 A cautionary note, people who have retinitis pigmentosa,

1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:31.380
 macular degeneration, or glaucoma,

1:19:31.380 --> 1:19:34.740
 as well as people who are especially prone to skin cancers

1:19:34.740 --> 1:19:37.660
 should definitely consult with your ophthalmologist

1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:40.140
 and dermatologist before you start increasing

1:19:40.140 --> 1:19:42.640
 the total amount of UVB exposure that you're getting

1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:44.980
 from any source, sunlight or otherwise.

1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:46.940
 There are additional very interesting

1:19:46.940 --> 1:19:50.240
 and powerful effects of UVB light,

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:52.500
 in particular on immune function.

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:57.340
 All the organs of our body are inside our skin.

1:19:57.340 --> 1:20:00.500
 And so information about external conditions,

1:20:00.500 --> 1:20:02.260
 meaning the environment that we're in,

1:20:02.260 --> 1:20:06.400
 need to be communicated to the various organs of our body.

1:20:06.400 --> 1:20:08.700
 Some of them have more direct access

1:20:08.700 --> 1:20:10.620
 to what's going on outside.

1:20:10.620 --> 1:20:13.820
 So for instance, the cells in your brain

1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:15.640
 that reside right over the roof of your mouth,

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:17.780
 your hypothalamus, they control hormone output

1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:20.600
 and they control the biological functions

1:20:20.600 --> 1:20:21.980
 that we call circadian functions,

1:20:21.980 --> 1:20:24.440
 the ones that change every 24 hours.

1:20:24.440 --> 1:20:27.060
 Well, those are just one or two connections,

1:20:27.060 --> 1:20:29.780
 meaning synapses away from those cells in your eye

1:20:29.780 --> 1:20:32.500
 that perceive UVB light, excuse me.

1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:35.980
 Other organs of your body, such as your spleen,

1:20:35.980 --> 1:20:39.340
 which is involved in the creation of molecules and cells

1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:41.220
 that combat infection.

1:20:41.220 --> 1:20:42.940
 Well, those are a long ways away

1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:43.900
 from those cells in your eye.

1:20:43.900 --> 1:20:47.240
 And in fact, they're a long ways away from your skin.

1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:49.980
 There are beautiful studies showing you that

1:20:49.980 --> 1:20:53.220
 if we get more UVB exposure from sunlight

1:20:53.220 --> 1:20:55.980
 or from appropriate artificial sources,

1:20:57.220 --> 1:21:00.820
 that spleen and immune function are enhanced.

1:21:00.820 --> 1:21:04.260
 And there's a very logical, well-established circuit

1:21:04.260 --> 1:21:06.020
 as to how that happens.

1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:09.320
 Your brain actually connects to your spleen.

1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:12.100
 Now it's not the case that you can simply think,

1:21:12.100 --> 1:21:14.680
 okay, spleen, turn on, release killer cells,

1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:16.380
 go out and combat infection.

1:21:16.380 --> 1:21:20.700
 However, UVB light arriving on the eyes

1:21:20.700 --> 1:21:23.500
 is known to trigger activation of the neurons

1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:26.020
 within the so-called sympathetic nervous system.

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:28.360
 These neurons are part of the larger thing

1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:30.100
 that we call the autonomic nervous system,

1:21:30.100 --> 1:21:34.180
 meaning it's below or not accessible by conscious control.

1:21:34.180 --> 1:21:35.540
 It's the thing that controls your heartbeat,

1:21:35.540 --> 1:21:38.020
 controls your breathing, and that also activates

1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:41.000
 or flips on the switch of your immune system.

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.540
 When we get a lot of UVB light in our eyes,

1:21:43.540 --> 1:21:46.860
 or I should say sufficient UVB light in our eyes,

1:21:46.860 --> 1:21:50.120
 a particular channel, a particular set of connections

1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:53.220
 within the sympathetic nervous system is activated

1:21:53.220 --> 1:21:57.340
 and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules

1:21:57.340 --> 1:22:00.300
 that scavenge for and combat infection.

1:22:00.300 --> 1:22:03.860
 So if you've noticed that you get fewer colds and flus

1:22:03.860 --> 1:22:06.780
 and other forms of illness in the summer months,

1:22:06.780 --> 1:22:09.860
 part of that could be because of the increase

1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:11.120
 in temperature in your environment,

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:13.280
 because typically longer days are associated

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:15.620
 with more warmth in your environment

1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:17.460
 as opposed to winter days, which are short

1:22:17.460 --> 1:22:19.540
 when it tends to be colder out.

1:22:19.540 --> 1:22:23.960
 Well, that's true, but it's also the case

1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:26.440
 the people around you have fewer colds and flus

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:29.620
 and that you will get infected with fewer colds and flus

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:34.480
 and other infections because if those infections,

1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:36.900
 whether or not they're bacterial or viral,

1:22:36.900 --> 1:22:39.380
 arrive in your body, right, if you inhale them

1:22:39.380 --> 1:22:41.980
 or they get into your mouth or on your skin,

1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:45.500
 your spleen meets those infections with a greater output.

1:22:45.500 --> 1:22:47.540
 In other words, the soldiers of your immune system,

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:50.220
 the chemicals and cell types of your immune system

1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:55.220
 that combat infection are in a more ready deployed stance,

1:22:55.220 --> 1:22:56.460
 if you will.

1:22:56.460 --> 1:22:58.140
 If you want to know more about the immune system

1:22:58.140 --> 1:23:00.000
 and immune function, I did an entire episode

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.660
 about the immune system and the brain in a,

1:23:02.660 --> 1:23:04.820
 you can find that at hubermanlab.com.

1:23:04.820 --> 1:23:06.820
 We talk about cytokines, we talk about killer cells,

1:23:06.820 --> 1:23:09.500
 B cells, T cells, et cetera, a lot of detail there.

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:11.720
 So we often think about the summer months

1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:15.300
 and the spring months as fewer infections floating around,

1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:18.840
 but in fact, there aren't fewer infections floating around.

1:23:18.840 --> 1:23:21.460
 We are simply better at combating those infections

1:23:21.460 --> 1:23:25.060
 and therefore there's less infection floating around.

1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:27.620
 So we are still confronted with a lot of infections.

1:23:27.620 --> 1:23:29.920
 We're just able to combat them better.

1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:31.360
 What does this mean in terms of a tool?

1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:33.840
 What it means is that during the winter months,

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:38.560
 we should be especially conscious of accessing UVB light

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:41.320
 to enhance our spleen function,

1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:43.700
 to make sure that our sympathetic nervous system

1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:46.180
 is activated to a sufficient level

1:23:46.180 --> 1:23:48.380
 to keep our immune system deploying

1:23:48.380 --> 1:23:51.100
 all those killer T cells and B cells and cytokines

1:23:51.100 --> 1:23:52.860
 so that when we encounter the infections,

1:23:52.860 --> 1:23:54.740
 as we inevitably will, right,

1:23:54.740 --> 1:23:57.740
 we're constantly being bombarded with potential infections

1:23:57.740 --> 1:24:00.220
 that we can combat those infections well.

1:24:00.220 --> 1:24:01.980
 And as just a brief aside,

1:24:01.980 --> 1:24:03.620
 but I should mention a brief aside

1:24:03.620 --> 1:24:07.240
 that's related to tens of thousands of quality studies.

1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:10.540
 It is well-known that wound healing is faster

1:24:10.540 --> 1:24:13.900
 when we are getting sufficient UVB exposure.

1:24:13.900 --> 1:24:16.340
 Typically that's associated with the longer days

1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:17.700
 of spring and summer.

1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:21.400
 It is known that turnover of hair cells,

1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:23.580
 the very cells that give rise to hair cells

1:24:23.580 --> 1:24:24.420
 are called stem cells.

1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:27.040
 They live in little so-called niches in our skin

1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:28.540
 with these hair stem cells

1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:31.000
 and your hair grows faster in longer days.

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.460
 That too is triggered by UVB exposure,

1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:37.520
 not just to the skin, but to the eyes.

1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:38.460
 That's right.

1:24:38.460 --> 1:24:40.700
 There was a study published in the Proceedings

1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:44.100
 of the National Academy of Sciences a couple of years ago

1:24:44.100 --> 1:24:47.460
 that showed that the exposure of those melanopsin ganglion

1:24:47.460 --> 1:24:49.940
 cells in your eyes is absolutely critical

1:24:49.940 --> 1:24:53.340
 for triggering the turnover of stem cells

1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:58.340
 in both the skin and hair and also it turns out in nails.

1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:01.240
 So if you've noticed that your skin, your hair

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.580
 and your nails look better and turn over more,

1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:06.580
 meaning grow faster in longer days,

1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:08.060
 that is not a coincidence.

1:25:08.060 --> 1:25:09.780
 That is not just your perception.

1:25:09.780 --> 1:25:13.500
 In fact, hair grows more, skin turns over more,

1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:14.880
 meaning it's going to look more youthful.

1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:18.220
 You're going to essentially remove older skin cells

1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:20.320
 and replace them with new cells.

1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:23.660
 And all the renewing cells and tissues of our body

1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:24.780
 are going to proliferate,

1:25:24.780 --> 1:25:27.400
 are going to recreate themselves more

1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:30.240
 when we're getting sufficient UVB light to our eyes

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:31.980
 and also to our skin.

1:25:31.980 --> 1:25:36.180
 And so while some of you may think of light therapies

1:25:36.180 --> 1:25:38.560
 such as red light therapies or UVB therapies

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:41.020
 as kind of new agey or just biohacking,

1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:43.380
 again, a phrase I don't particularly like this notion

1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:46.620
 of biohacking because it implies using one thing

1:25:46.620 --> 1:25:49.700
 for a purpose that it was never intended to have.

1:25:50.660 --> 1:25:54.260
 Well, it turns out that UVB exposure and red light

1:25:54.260 --> 1:25:57.500
 as we'll soon see is a very potent form

1:25:57.500 --> 1:26:00.140
 of increasing things like wound healing and skin health

1:26:00.140 --> 1:26:04.660
 for very logical mechanistically backed reasons.

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:07.460
 So while I can't account for everything

1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:09.860
 that's being promoted out there in terms of this light source

1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:11.280
 will help your skin look more youthful

1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:13.420
 or will help heal your scars,

1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:17.560
 the mechanistic basis for light having those effects

1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:19.160
 makes total sense.

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:21.240
 But what you should consider, however,

1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:23.700
 is that if the particular light therapy

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:27.580
 that you're considering involves very local application

1:26:27.580 --> 1:26:32.560
 rather than illuminating broad swaths of skin,

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.000
 and if it has no involvement with the eyes,

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:38.860
 meaning there's no delivery of UVB or red light

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:41.420
 or the other light therapy to the eyes,

1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:44.940
 it's probably not going to be as potent a treatment

1:26:44.940 --> 1:26:48.140
 as would a more systemic activation

1:26:48.140 --> 1:26:51.100
 of larger areas of skin and the eyes.

1:26:51.100 --> 1:26:52.820
 Now, again, a cautionary note,

1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:54.480
 I don't want people taking technologies

1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:56.500
 that were designed for local application

1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:58.260
 and beaming those into the eyes.

1:26:58.260 --> 1:27:00.800
 That could be very, very bad and damaging to your retinal

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:02.540
 and other tissues.

1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:05.260
 Certainly wouldn't want you taking bright light

1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:07.440
 of very high intensity of any kind

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:09.580
 and getting cavalier about that.

1:27:09.580 --> 1:27:12.940
 Typically the local illumination of say a wound

1:27:12.940 --> 1:27:14.380
 or a particular patch of acne

1:27:14.380 --> 1:27:17.020
 or some other form of skin treatment

1:27:17.020 --> 1:27:18.820
 involves very high intensity light.

1:27:18.820 --> 1:27:20.460
 And if the intensity is too high,

1:27:20.460 --> 1:27:22.380
 you can actually damage that skin.

1:27:22.380 --> 1:27:24.880
 And so as we'll talk about in a few moments,

1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:27.380
 most of those therapies for modifying skin

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:29.460
 involve actually burning off

1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:33.460
 a small, very thin layer at the top of the epidermis

1:27:33.460 --> 1:27:35.620
 in efforts to trigger the renewal

1:27:35.620 --> 1:27:37.020
 or the activation of stem cells

1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:39.860
 that will replenish that with new cells.

1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:44.340
 So there's a fine line to be had between light therapies

1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:45.980
 that are very localized and intense,

1:27:45.980 --> 1:27:48.140
 which are designed to damage skin

1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:52.500
 and cause reactivation of new stem cells,

1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:54.740
 whether or not it's hair cells or skin cells, et cetera,

1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:56.480
 versus systemic activation

1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:58.340
 across broad swaths of skin in the eyes.

1:27:58.340 --> 1:28:00.880
 You really have to consider this on a case-by-case basis,

1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:02.720
 but at least for now,

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:05.920
 just consider that increases in hormones,

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:10.620
 reduction in pain by way of increases in enkephalin

1:28:10.620 --> 1:28:12.700
 and other endogenous opioids,

1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:15.700
 improving immune status by activating the spleen

1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:17.380
 and so on and so on,

1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:19.540
 really are all the downstream consequence

1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:21.900
 of illuminating large swaths of skin

1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.940
 and making sure that those neurons within the eye

1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:26.240
 get their adequate UVB exposure

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:28.220
 or other light wavelength exposure.

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:31.340
 Not simply beaming a particular wavelength of light

1:28:31.340 --> 1:28:32.900
 at a particular location on the body

1:28:32.900 --> 1:28:35.360
 and hoping that that particular illumination

1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:37.100
 at a particular location on the body

1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:40.460
 is going to somehow change the biology at that location.

1:28:40.460 --> 1:28:43.300
 Our biology just really doesn't work that way.

1:28:43.300 --> 1:28:45.240
 It's possible, but in general,

1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:48.420
 systemic effects through broad scale illumination

1:28:48.420 --> 1:28:51.580
 and illumination to the eye combined with local treatments

1:28:51.580 --> 1:28:54.340
 are very likely to be the ones that have the most success.

1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:55.680
 Now I'd like to shift our attention

1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:57.980
 to the effects of light on mood more specifically.

1:28:57.980 --> 1:28:58.820
 We talked about this

1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:00.680
 in terms of seasonal affective disorder,

1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:03.380
 but many of us don't suffer from seasonal affective disorder.

1:29:03.380 --> 1:29:04.820
 So I'd like to drill a little deeper

1:29:04.820 --> 1:29:07.640
 into how light impacts mood.

1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:11.760
 And here, I want to again paraphrase the statements

1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:14.460
 of Dr. Samra Hattar

1:29:14.460 --> 1:29:16.780
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health.

1:29:16.780 --> 1:29:18.940
 I should mention the director of the Chronobiology Unit

1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:20.660
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health

1:29:20.660 --> 1:29:25.660
 and perhaps one of the top one to two to three world experts

1:29:25.660 --> 1:29:28.180
 in how light can impact mood, appetite,

1:29:28.180 --> 1:29:29.780
 circadian rhythms, and so forth.

1:29:31.660 --> 1:29:33.020
 Samra stated on the podcast,

1:29:33.020 --> 1:29:36.220
 and he said in various other venues as well,

1:29:36.220 --> 1:29:40.560
 that getting as much UVB light in our eyes and on our skin

1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:42.380
 in the early day and throughout the day

1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:45.500
 as is safely possible is going to be beneficial for mood.

1:29:45.500 --> 1:29:48.100
 There's also another time of day,

1:29:48.100 --> 1:29:49.780
 or rather I should say a time of night

1:29:49.780 --> 1:29:54.400
 in which UVB can be leveraged in order to improve mood.

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:55.900
 But it's actually the inverse

1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:59.380
 of everything we've been talking about up until now.

1:29:59.380 --> 1:30:01.740
 We have a particular neural circuit

1:30:01.740 --> 1:30:04.900
 that originates with those melanopsin cells in our eye

1:30:04.900 --> 1:30:07.220
 that bypass all the areas of the brain

1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:09.140
 associated with circadian clocks.

1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:11.540
 So everything related to sleep and wakefulness

1:30:11.540 --> 1:30:14.760
 that's specifically dedicated to the pathways

1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:16.980
 involving the release of molecules like dopamine,

1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:19.900
 the neuromodulator that's associated with motivation,

1:30:19.900 --> 1:30:22.120
 with feeling good,

1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:24.540
 with feeling like there's possibility in the world

1:30:24.540 --> 1:30:25.760
 and so on and so forth.

1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:26.920
 And other molecules as well,

1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:29.700
 including serotonin and some of those endogenous opioids

1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:31.100
 that we talked about before.

1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:34.340
 That particular pathway involves a brain structure

1:30:34.340 --> 1:30:36.700
 called the perihabenular nucleus.

1:30:36.700 --> 1:30:39.700
 The perihabenular nucleus gets input

1:30:39.700 --> 1:30:43.420
 from the cells in the eye that respond to UVB light

1:30:43.420 --> 1:30:46.740
 and frankly to bright light of other wavelengths as well.

1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:49.440
 Because as you recall, if a light is bright enough,

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.340
 even if it's not UV or blue light,

1:30:51.340 --> 1:30:53.820
 it can activate those cells in the eye.

1:30:53.820 --> 1:30:55.340
 Those cells in the eye communicate

1:30:55.340 --> 1:30:57.380
 to the perihabenular nucleus.

1:30:57.380 --> 1:31:01.060
 And as it turns out, if this pathway is activated

1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:04.740
 at the wrong time of each 24 hour cycle,

1:31:04.740 --> 1:31:07.060
 mood gets worse.

1:31:07.060 --> 1:31:09.740
 Dopamine output gets worse.

1:31:09.740 --> 1:31:13.180
 Molecules that are there specifically to make us feel good

1:31:13.180 --> 1:31:16.080
 actually are reduced in their output.

1:31:16.980 --> 1:31:19.460
 So while UVB exposure in the morning

1:31:19.460 --> 1:31:22.820
 and throughout the day is going to be very important

1:31:22.820 --> 1:31:26.500
 for elevating and maintaining elevated mood,

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:30.820
 avoiding UVB light at night is actually a way

1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:33.660
 in which we can prevent activation

1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:36.900
 of this eye to perihabenular pathway

1:31:36.900 --> 1:31:38.900
 that can actually turn on depression.

1:31:38.900 --> 1:31:41.640
 To be very direct and succinct about this,

1:31:41.640 --> 1:31:44.980
 avoid exposure to UVB light from artificial sources

1:31:45.820 --> 1:31:48.460
 between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM.

1:31:48.460 --> 1:31:51.780
 And if you're somebody who suffers from low mood

1:31:51.780 --> 1:31:54.660
 and overall has a kind of mild depression

1:31:54.660 --> 1:31:56.460
 or even severe depression, of course,

1:31:56.460 --> 1:31:59.340
 please see a psychiatrist, see a trained psychologist,

1:31:59.340 --> 1:32:00.940
 get that treated.

1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:05.940
 But you would do especially well to avoid UVB exposure

1:32:06.460 --> 1:32:09.560
 from artificial sources, not just from 10 PM to 4 AM,

1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:12.020
 but really be careful about getting too much exposure

1:32:12.020 --> 1:32:14.380
 to UVB even in the late evening.

1:32:14.380 --> 1:32:17.180
 So 8 PM perhaps to 4 AM.

1:32:17.180 --> 1:32:21.740
 I can't emphasize this enough that if you view UVB light,

1:32:21.740 --> 1:32:24.540
 you activate those neurons in your eye very potently.

1:32:24.540 --> 1:32:26.780
 And if those cells communicate

1:32:26.780 --> 1:32:28.660
 to the perihabenular nucleus, which they do,

1:32:28.660 --> 1:32:31.620
 you will truncate or reduce the amount of dopamine

1:32:31.620 --> 1:32:32.500
 that you release.

1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:36.120
 So if you want to keep your mood elevated,

1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:38.880
 get a lot of light, UVB light throughout the day,

1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:42.840
 and at night, really be cautious about getting UVB exposure

1:32:42.840 --> 1:32:44.120
 from artificial sources.

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:46.920
 Now let's say you're somebody who has no issues with mood.

1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:49.500
 You're just the happiest person all year long,

1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:52.520
 or maybe you just have subtle variations in your mood.

1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:53.820
 You feel great about that.

1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:57.900
 Turns out that you still want to be very careful

1:32:57.900 --> 1:33:02.040
 about light exposure between the hours of 10 PM or so

1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:04.980
 and 4 AM, in fact, even during sleep.

1:33:04.980 --> 1:33:06.780
 There's a recent study that just came out

1:33:06.780 --> 1:33:09.720
 in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

1:33:09.720 --> 1:33:12.700
 and it's entitled light exposure during sleep

1:33:12.700 --> 1:33:14.980
 in pairs cardiometabolic function.

1:33:14.980 --> 1:33:17.660
 This is a very interesting study

1:33:17.660 --> 1:33:20.180
 where they took human subjects, young adults,

1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:22.620
 and having them sleep in rooms

1:33:22.620 --> 1:33:24.000
 that had different lighting conditions,

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:27.880
 either dim light or slightly bright light.

1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:30.420
 Now, many people can't fall asleep in brightly lit rooms.

1:33:30.420 --> 1:33:32.220
 So they acknowledged this.

1:33:32.220 --> 1:33:33.940
 These were not very brightly lit rooms.

1:33:33.940 --> 1:33:36.220
 These were rooms that had just a little bit

1:33:36.220 --> 1:33:39.220
 of overhead room lighting, a hundred lux,

1:33:39.220 --> 1:33:41.260
 which is not very bright at all.

1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:43.880
 Or they had them sleep in a room that had very dim light,

1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:45.780
 which is less than three lux.

1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:49.140
 If you want to get a sense of how bright three lux is

1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:50.740
 versus a hundred lux,

1:33:50.740 --> 1:33:53.860
 I would encourage you to download the free app Light Meter.

1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:55.380
 I have no relationship to the app.

1:33:55.380 --> 1:33:56.220
 It's a pretty cool app.

1:33:56.220 --> 1:33:57.540
 However, I've used it for a long time

1:33:57.540 --> 1:34:00.040
 where you can basically point your phone

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:02.320
 at a particular light source, sun or otherwise,

1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:03.220
 and you just press the button

1:34:03.220 --> 1:34:05.580
 and it'll give you an approximate readout of lux,

1:34:05.580 --> 1:34:08.760
 which is the light intensity that the phone happens

1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.900
 to be staring out at at that location.

1:34:10.900 --> 1:34:14.060
 It's not exact, but it's a pretty good

1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:17.420
 back of the envelope measure of light intensity.

1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:20.380
 So these subjects were either sleeping in a very dim room,

1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:22.140
 three lux is very, very dim,

1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:25.900
 or a somewhat dim room, a hundred lux.

1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:29.180
 In this study, they measured things like melatonin levels.

1:34:29.180 --> 1:34:30.920
 They looked at heart rate.

1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:35.900
 They looked at measures of insulin and glucose management.

1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:38.020
 Now, in previous episodes,

1:34:38.020 --> 1:34:41.340
 I've talked about how glucose blood sugar is regulated

1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:43.920
 by insulin because you don't want your glucose levels

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.580
 to be too high, hyperglycemia or too low.

1:34:46.580 --> 1:34:49.140
 Hypoglycemia and the hormone insulin is involved

1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:52.480
 in sequestering and shuttling glucose in the bloodstream.

1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:55.380
 Basically how well you manage glucose in the bloodstream

1:34:55.380 --> 1:34:58.460
 can be indirectly measured by your insulin levels.

1:34:58.460 --> 1:35:01.460
 And it's well-known that sleep deprivation

1:35:01.460 --> 1:35:06.460
 can disrupt glucose regulation by insulin.

1:35:06.460 --> 1:35:08.260
 However, in this study,

1:35:08.260 --> 1:35:10.120
 subjects were sleeping the whole night through.

1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:11.720
 It just so happens that some of the subjects

1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:14.120
 were sleeping in this very dimly lit room, three lux,

1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:15.360
 and other subjects were sleeping

1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:19.720
 in a somewhat dimly lit room, a hundred lux.

1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:23.220
 What's incredible about this study is that both rooms

1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:25.280
 were sufficiently dim that melatonin levels

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:27.460
 were not altered in either case.

1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:28.300
 This is really key.

1:35:28.300 --> 1:35:31.460
 It's not as if one group experienced a lot of bright light

1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:33.600
 through their eyelids and others did not.

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.520
 Melatonin levels were not disrupted.

1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:38.240
 And given how potently light can inhibit melatonin,

1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:41.440
 this speaks to the fact that this very dim condition

1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:44.840
 of three lux and the somewhat dim condition of a hundred lux

1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:48.040
 was not actually perceived by the subjects,

1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:50.720
 nor was it disrupting these hormone pathways.

1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:53.240
 They also looked at glucose responses.

1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:56.440
 They had people essentially take a fasting glucose test

1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:57.340
 in different conditions.

1:35:57.340 --> 1:35:58.920
 I won't go into all the details,

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:00.380
 but here's what they found.

1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:01.920
 In healthy adults,

1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:06.400
 even just one night of sleeping in a moderately lit

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:10.880
 environment, this hundred lux environment caused changes,

1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:12.600
 increases in nighttime heart rate,

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.400
 which means that the sympathetic nervous system

1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:17.080
 was overly active as compared to people that slept

1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:20.860
 in a completely dark or in a very, very dimly lit room.

1:36:20.860 --> 1:36:23.460
 Decreases in heart rate variability.

1:36:23.460 --> 1:36:25.720
 And here I should point out that heart rate variability

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:27.420
 or HRV is a good thing.

1:36:27.420 --> 1:36:28.660
 We want heart rate variability.

1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:30.360
 So they saw increases in heart rate,

1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:33.680
 decreases in heart rate variability and increases

1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.320
 in next morning insulin resistance,

1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:40.740
 which is an indication that glucose management is suffering.

1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:43.280
 So this is powerful.

1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:46.400
 The results of this study essentially indicate that even

1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.120
 just one night of sleeping the whole night through

1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:52.460
 in a dimly lit environment is disrupting the way

1:36:52.460 --> 1:36:54.920
 that our autonomic nervous system is functioning,

1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:57.520
 altering so-called autonomic tone,

1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.260
 making us less relaxed is probably the best way

1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:01.480
 to describe it.

1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:03.080
 Even though we are asleep,

1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:06.820
 disrupting the way that our cardiometabolic function

1:37:06.820 --> 1:37:09.820
 operates such that we have lower heart rate variability

1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:12.880
 and increased insulin resistance.

1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:15.640
 This is not a good thing for any of us to experience.

1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:18.240
 So while we've mainly been talking about the positive

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:21.180
 effects of UVB light and other forms of light.

1:37:21.180 --> 1:37:22.920
 Now we have two examples,

1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:25.600
 one from the work of Hatar and colleagues showing

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:29.480
 that UVB exposure via the perihabenula can diminish

1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:32.480
 the output of dopamine and other molecules that make

1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:34.840
 us feel good if that UVB exposure is in the middle

1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:36.760
 of the night or late evening.

1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:39.800
 And now we have yet another study performed in this case

1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:43.160
 in humans indicating that even if we fall asleep

1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:44.560
 and sleep the whole night through,

1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:47.520
 if the room that we're sleeping in has too many locks,

1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:48.820
 too much light energy,

1:37:48.820 --> 1:37:51.820
 that light energy is no doubt going through the eyelids,

1:37:51.820 --> 1:37:55.600
 which it can activating the particular cells in the eye

1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:59.160
 that trigger an increase in sympathetic nervous system

1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:02.340
 activation and disrupting our metabolism.

1:38:02.340 --> 1:38:05.640
 And this study rests on a number of other recent studies

1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:06.680
 published in Cell,

1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:09.400
 which is a superb journal and other journals showing that

1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:13.040
 during the course of a healthy deep night's sleep,

1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:15.400
 our body actually transitions through various forms

1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:16.760
 of metabolic function.

1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:20.400
 We actually experience ketosis like states.

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:22.840
 We experience gluconeogenesis.

1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:25.640
 We experience different forms of metabolism associated

1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:27.200
 with different stages of sleep.

1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:29.760
 Not something that we're going into in depth in this podcast,

1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:31.760
 we will in a future podcast.

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:35.920
 What this study shows is that light exposure even in sleep

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:38.480
 is disrupting our autonomic, in this case,

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:40.920
 the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system

1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:44.240
 in ways that are disrupting metabolism probably in sleep,

1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:46.240
 but certainly outside of sleep.

1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:48.400
 So that we wake up and have our first meal of the day,

1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:49.680
 or even if you're intermittent fasting,

1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:51.280
 you eat that first meal of the day.

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:54.280
 If your sleep is taking place in an environment

1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:56.560
 that's overly illuminated,

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:59.260
 well, that's disrupting your cardiac function

1:38:59.260 --> 1:39:00.680
 and your metabolism.

1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.440
 I've been talking a lot about UVB light,

1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:03.940
 which is short wavelength light.

1:39:03.940 --> 1:39:07.140
 So UV light, blue light, maybe even some blue green light,

1:39:07.140 --> 1:39:08.640
 that's going to be short wavelength light.

1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:10.440
 Now I'd like to shift our attention to the other end

1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:12.320
 of the spectrum, meaning the light spectrum,

1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:14.320
 to talk about red light and infrared light,

1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:16.220
 which is long wavelength light.

1:39:16.220 --> 1:39:19.920
 Many so-called low level light therapies,

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:23.960
 the acronym is LLLT, low level light therapies

1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:27.560
 involve the use of red light and infrared light.

1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:31.080
 Sometimes low level light therapies involve the use of UVB,

1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:32.720
 but more often than not these days,

1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:35.720
 when we hear LLLT, low level light therapy,

1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:37.480
 it's referring to red light

1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.980
 and near infrared light therapies.

1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:44.560
 Low level light therapies have been shown to be effective

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:47.600
 for a huge number of biological phenomenon

1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:49.380
 and medical treatments.

1:39:49.380 --> 1:39:50.900
 I can't summarize all of those now.

1:39:50.900 --> 1:39:52.720
 It would take me many, many hours.

1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:55.360
 It would be an effective episode for curing insomnia,

1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:57.320
 but it wouldn't inform you properly

1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.760
 about the use of light for your health.

1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:01.340
 Rather, I'd like to just emphasize

1:40:01.340 --> 1:40:03.520
 some of the top contour of those studies

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:05.980
 and point out that for instance,

1:40:05.980 --> 1:40:08.120
 low level light therapy with infrared light

1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:10.920
 has been shown to be effective for the treatment of acne

1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:13.000
 and other sorts of skin lesions.

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.160
 Been some really nice studies actually,

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:17.960
 where they use subjects as their own internal control.

1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:19.120
 So people who believe it or not

1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:21.620
 agreed to have half of their face illuminated

1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:23.880
 with red light or near infrared light

1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:26.000
 and the other half of their face serve as a control

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.300
 and to do that for several weeks at a time.

1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:31.060
 And you can see pretty impressive reductions

1:40:31.060 --> 1:40:35.200
 in skin lesions, reductions in scars from acne

1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:38.180
 and reduction in acne lesions themselves,

1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:40.980
 meaning the accumulation of new acne cysts

1:40:40.980 --> 1:40:42.540
 with low level light therapy

1:40:42.540 --> 1:40:44.560
 using red light and infrared light.

1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:49.240
 Sometimes however, there is a resistance of that acne

1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:50.580
 to the low level light therapy

1:40:50.580 --> 1:40:52.760
 such that people will get an initial improvement

1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:55.660
 and then it will go away despite continuing the treatment.

1:40:55.660 --> 1:40:58.200
 So you're probably asking, or at least you should be asking,

1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:00.740
 how is it that shining red light on our skin

1:41:00.740 --> 1:41:04.600
 can impact things like acne and wound healing, et cetera?

1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:06.720
 Well, to understand that we have to think back

1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:08.340
 to the beginning of the episode

1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.720
 where I described how long wavelength lights

1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:13.080
 such as red light and near infrared light,

1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:15.120
 which is even longer than red light,

1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.140
 can pass through certain surfaces, including our skin.

1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:21.780
 So our skin has an epidermis, which is on the outside

1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:24.400
 and the dermis, which is in the deeper layers.

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:25.960
 Red light and infrared light

1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:29.020
 can pass down into the deeper layers of our skin

1:41:29.020 --> 1:41:31.740
 where it can change the metabolic function

1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:32.860
 of particular cells.

1:41:32.860 --> 1:41:35.600
 So let's just take acne as an example.

1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:37.900
 Within the dermis, the deep layers of our skin,

1:41:37.900 --> 1:41:39.700
 we have what are called sebaceous glands

1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:43.700
 that actually make the oil that is present in our skin.

1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:46.700
 Those sebaceous glands are often nearby hair follicles.

1:41:46.700 --> 1:41:50.100
 So if you've ever had an infected hair follicle,

1:41:50.100 --> 1:41:51.480
 that's not a coincidence

1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.100
 that hair follicles tend to get infected.

1:41:53.100 --> 1:41:56.220
 Part of it is because there's actually a portal down

1:41:56.220 --> 1:41:57.380
 and around the hair follicle,

1:41:57.380 --> 1:42:00.500
 but the sebaceous gland is where the oil is created

1:42:00.500 --> 1:42:03.740
 that is going to give rise to, for instance, acne lesions.

1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:06.900
 Also in the dermis and the deep layers of the skin

1:42:06.900 --> 1:42:07.900
 are the melanocytes.

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:08.900
 They're not just in the epidermis,

1:42:08.900 --> 1:42:11.780
 they're also in the deeper layers of the skin.

1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:14.740
 And you have the stem cells that give rise

1:42:14.740 --> 1:42:16.800
 to additional skin cells.

1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:19.180
 If the top layers of the epidermis are damaged,

1:42:19.180 --> 1:42:21.260
 those stem cells can become activated.

1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:23.520
 And you also have the stem cells

1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:25.340
 that give rise to hair follicles.

1:42:25.340 --> 1:42:29.620
 So by shining red light or near infrared light

1:42:29.620 --> 1:42:31.580
 on a localized patch of skin,

1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:34.940
 provided that red light is not of such high intensity

1:42:34.940 --> 1:42:36.500
 that it burns the skin,

1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:38.520
 but is of sufficient intensity

1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:41.080
 that provides just a little bit of damage

1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:43.820
 to the upper layers of the skin, the epidermis,

1:42:43.820 --> 1:42:47.180
 and that it triggers certain biological pathways

1:42:47.180 --> 1:42:49.500
 within the cells of the sebaceous gland

1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:52.460
 and the stem cells within the hair cell niche

1:42:52.460 --> 1:42:54.020
 and the stem cells in skin.

1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:56.660
 What happens is the top layers of the skin

1:42:56.660 --> 1:43:00.460
 are basically burned off by a very low level of burn

1:43:00.460 --> 1:43:02.420
 and or the cells in the deeper layer

1:43:02.420 --> 1:43:03.900
 start to churn out new cells

1:43:03.900 --> 1:43:07.380
 which go and rescue the lesion,

1:43:07.380 --> 1:43:09.620
 essentially clear out the lesion

1:43:09.620 --> 1:43:12.020
 and replace that lesion with healthy skin cells.

1:43:12.020 --> 1:43:17.020
 This does work in the context of wound healing,

1:43:17.420 --> 1:43:19.020
 getting scars to disappear.

1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:22.980
 It also works to remove certain patches of pigmentation.

1:43:22.980 --> 1:43:24.840
 There are sometimes cases where people will get

1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:28.580
 a red blotchiness due to certain skin conditions

1:43:28.580 --> 1:43:31.340
 or some darker pigmentation that they want removed

1:43:31.340 --> 1:43:32.560
 or that they need removed

1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:36.020
 because it's a potential skin cancer threat.

1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:37.860
 Now, how is red light actually doing it

1:43:37.860 --> 1:43:39.520
 within the cells of the sebaceous gland,

1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:41.000
 the stem cells, et cetera?

1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.180
 Well, long wavelength light

1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:45.160
 can actually get deep into the skin.

1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:46.000
 I mentioned that before,

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.940
 but can also get into individual cells

1:43:49.780 --> 1:43:51.700
 and can access the so-called organelles,

1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:53.340
 which I described at the beginning of the episode.

1:43:53.340 --> 1:43:55.800
 In particular, they can access the mitochondria

1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:58.500
 which are responsible for producing ATP.

1:43:58.500 --> 1:44:00.540
 Now, the simple way to think about this

1:44:00.540 --> 1:44:05.540
 for sake of this discussion is that as cells age

1:44:06.140 --> 1:44:09.100
 and in particular in very metabolically active cells,

1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:12.780
 they accumulate what are called ROSs,

1:44:12.780 --> 1:44:14.960
 reactive oxygen species.

1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:18.760
 And as reactive oxygen species go up,

1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:22.360
 ATP energy production in those cells tends to go down.

1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:23.400
 It's a general statement,

1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:27.160
 but it's a general statement that in most cases is true.

1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:29.880
 There are some minor exceptions that don't concern us

1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:31.720
 that have to do with cell types different

1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:33.520
 than the ones that I'm talking about now.

1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:35.880
 So the way to think about this is that red light passes

1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:37.980
 into the deeper layers of the skin,

1:44:37.980 --> 1:44:40.940
 activates mitochondria, which increases ATP

1:44:40.940 --> 1:44:42.720
 and directly or indirectly

1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:45.040
 reduces these reactive oxygen species.

1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:48.200
 These reactive oxygen species are not good.

1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:49.360
 We don't want them.

1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:52.360
 They cause cellular damage, cellular death,

1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:53.840
 and for the most part,

1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:56.660
 just inhibit the way that our cells work.

1:44:56.660 --> 1:44:58.560
 So if you've heard of red light

1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:02.540
 or near infrared light therapies designed to heal skin

1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:05.040
 or improve skin quality or remove lesions

1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:07.860
 or get rid of scars or unwanted pigmentation,

1:45:07.860 --> 1:45:12.360
 that is not pseudoscience, that is not woo science,

1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:15.640
 that is grounded in the very biology of how light interacts

1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:18.360
 with mitochondria and reactive oxygen species.

1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:20.540
 Some of you may also find it interesting to note

1:45:20.540 --> 1:45:23.640
 that some of the cream-based treatments for acne,

1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:25.400
 for instance, like retinoic acid,

1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:30.040
 Retin-A is actually a derivative of vitamin A

1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:33.720
 and the pathway involving retinoic acid and vitamin A,

1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:34.560
 believe it or not,

1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:38.560
 is very similar to the natural biological pathway

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:42.000
 by which photopigments in the eye convert light information

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.680
 into biological changes within those cells.

1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:48.420
 So the key point here is that light is activating

1:45:48.420 --> 1:45:50.280
 particular pathways in cells

1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:52.840
 that can either drive death of cells

1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:55.720
 or can make those cells essentially younger

1:45:55.720 --> 1:46:00.560
 by increasing ATP by way of improving mitochondrial function

1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:01.840
 and in recent years,

1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:04.360
 there've been some just beautiful examples

1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:07.720
 that exist not only in the realm of skin biology,

1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:10.200
 but in the realm of neurobiology,

1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:12.800
 whereby red light and near infrared light

1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:15.640
 can actually be used to enhance the function of the cells

1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:17.760
 that for instance, allow us to see better

1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:20.600
 and indeed cells that allow us to think better.

1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:22.320
 So now I'd like to review those data

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:25.660
 because not only are they interesting in their own right,

1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:28.500
 but they also point to some very interesting

1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:31.920
 and powerful application of low cost or zero cost tools

1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:34.460
 that we can use to improve our vision.

1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:35.840
 If you are somebody who's interested

1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:38.880
 in the use of red light or near infrared light,

1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:41.720
 so-called LLLT, low level light therapies

1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:44.160
 for treatment of dermatologic issues,

1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:45.920
 so anything related to skin,

1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:49.160
 I will include a link to a excellent set of reviews.

1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:52.240
 The first one is light emitting diodes in dermatology,

1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:55.220
 a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.

1:46:55.220 --> 1:46:58.480
 That one includes review of a very large number of studies

1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:00.840
 came out just a few years ago in 2018

1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:03.880
 and I think is very clearly and cleanly laid out

1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:05.240
 for anyone to access.

1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:07.120
 You can see the degree of effects of red light,

1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:09.360
 for instance, on treatment of acne or scarring, et cetera.

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:12.040
 And I'll also provide a link to another review,

1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:14.320
 which is low level light therapy in skin,

1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:16.080
 stimulating healing and restoring.

1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:17.760
 So for those of you that are interested,

1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:19.420
 again, in dermatologic issues

1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:21.920
 and the kind of restoring youthfulness

1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:25.840
 and the kind of general themes of anti-aging and longevity

1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:28.740
 and how red light therapies can be used for that,

1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:31.360
 I will encourage you to take a look at those reviews.

1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:35.240
 What you're going to find is that rarely, if ever,

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:38.840
 is there a study looking at whole body red light illumination

1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:41.880
 for sake of treating and improving skin.

1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:44.320
 And I mention this because I get a lot of questions

1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:46.320
 about infrared sauna

1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:49.400
 and global illumination with red lights.

1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:52.520
 We'll talk more about cases where global illumination

1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:54.600
 of your whole body or your whole face

1:47:54.600 --> 1:47:56.560
 with red lights might be useful,

1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:58.400
 but in terms of infrared sauna,

1:47:58.400 --> 1:47:59.880
 I've mentioned on this podcast before,

1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:01.400
 and I will certainly go deeper on this

1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:02.400
 in an upcoming episode,

1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:04.840
 all about the use of heat and temperature

1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:06.960
 for augmenting our biology.

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:08.900
 But in general,

1:48:08.900 --> 1:48:13.040
 infrared saunas don't get hot enough temperature wise

1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:16.000
 in order to trigger some of the important effects

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.880
 on growth hormone and heat shock proteins

1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:18.760
 and some of the other things

1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:21.960
 that sauna has been shown to be excellent for.

1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:22.900
 That's a general statement.

1:48:22.900 --> 1:48:24.520
 I realize there are some infrared saunas

1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:26.400
 that do get hot enough.

1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:30.760
 There are very few data on the use of whole body illumination

1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:32.560
 with infrared saunas.

1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:35.240
 They really point to any specific

1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:37.400
 mechanistically supported effects.

1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:39.560
 Almost all the positive effects that you're going to see

1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:41.880
 of red light and low level light therapies,

1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:43.320
 certainly the ones discussed in the reviews

1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:44.200
 that I just mentioned,

1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:46.800
 are going to be the consequence

1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:49.320
 of very directed illumination

1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:52.080
 of particular patches of skin that are seeking repair

1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:54.240
 or that people are seeking the repair of.

1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:58.000
 So again, I don't want to disparage infrared saunas,

1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.360
 but in general, they don't get hot enough

1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.080
 to trigger most of the positive effects

1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:03.880
 that sauna have been demonstrated to have.

1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:07.000
 And it's unclear at all as to whether or not

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.320
 they can enhance skin quality, youthfulness,

1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:14.160
 restore top layers of skin that are damaged,

1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:15.720
 repair acne, et cetera.

1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:18.080
 So more on heat saunas and infrared saunas

1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:20.680
 in their comparison in an upcoming episode.

1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:23.560
 So let's talk about a clear set of examples

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:26.760
 where red light and near infrared light

1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:30.360
 have been shown to have positive effects on our health.

1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.400
 And these are the data that I referred to

1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:33.760
 at the beginning of the episode

1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:37.000
 from Dr. Glenn Jeffrey at University College London,

1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.600
 who again is a longstanding member

1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:41.680
 of the neuroscience community

1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:43.240
 working on visual neuroscience

1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:45.400
 and who over the last decade or so

1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:48.520
 has really emphasized the exploration of red light

1:49:48.520 --> 1:49:49.960
 and near infrared light

1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:53.960
 for restoration of neuronal function as we age.

1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:55.200
 This is absolutely critical.

1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:59.400
 We know that we don't accumulate many new brain cells

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:00.240
 as we get older.

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:02.220
 And in some areas of our nervous system,

1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:04.000
 such as our neural retina,

1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.040
 which is the part of our eye that's responsible

1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:08.480
 for translating light information to electrical signals

1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:10.160
 so that we can see,

1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:12.140
 we don't get any new cells

1:50:12.140 --> 1:50:14.000
 after the time in which we were born.

1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.560
 So the ability to keep our neurons healthy

1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:19.400
 is extremely important for our visual system,

1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:22.160
 extremely important for our hippocampus,

1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:24.260
 an area of the brain involved in memory.

1:50:24.260 --> 1:50:25.980
 And I should just mention

1:50:25.980 --> 1:50:28.040
 that even if people don't get Alzheimer's,

1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:29.960
 there's always going to be some degree

1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:31.860
 of age-related dementia.

1:50:31.860 --> 1:50:35.660
 Sadly, nobody is as cognitively sharp

1:50:35.660 --> 1:50:36.960
 in the years before they die

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:39.200
 as they are 20 years before that.

1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:40.320
 It's just never the case.

1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:43.080
 We're all getting worse at thinking, feeling,

1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:44.480
 perceiving, et cetera.

1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:46.680
 The question is how quickly we are getting worse.

1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:49.560
 So any mechanism by which we can preserve

1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:51.600
 or reverse neuronal function

1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:54.340
 turns out to be immensely beneficial.

1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:58.960
 The Jeffrey Lab has published two studies in recent years

1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:03.520
 on humans that looked directly, no pun intended,

1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:05.800
 at how red light and near infrared light

1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:08.300
 can improve visual function.

1:51:08.300 --> 1:51:10.320
 I'm going to describe the parameters of those studies

1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:13.220
 and then I'm going to describe what they found exactly.

1:51:13.220 --> 1:51:17.600
 The mechanistic motivation for these studies,

1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:22.480
 again, traces back to this effect of light on mitochondria.

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:24.240
 So to go a little bit deeper into that mechanism

1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:26.840
 just briefly so that you can frame

1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:29.400
 any potential protocol that you would develop.

1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:35.600
 When light arrives on cells, including neurons,

1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:37.620
 that light can penetrate into the cells

1:51:37.620 --> 1:51:38.980
 if it's of the appropriate wavelength,

1:51:38.980 --> 1:51:40.960
 red light can do that, it can get into cells,

1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:42.240
 it can access the mitochondria,

1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:44.000
 it can increase ATP.

1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:47.840
 In general, anytime ATP is doing its thing

1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:50.080
 to increase energy in cells,

1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:54.440
 it's involving this thing called cytochrome C,

1:51:54.440 --> 1:51:55.620
 which is an oxidase.

1:51:55.620 --> 1:51:58.720
 Anytime you hear ACE, A-S-E in biology,

1:51:58.720 --> 1:51:59.800
 it's going to be an enzyme.

1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:02.920
 It's involved in some process of degrading a molecule

1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:05.200
 and creating another molecule typically.

1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:08.440
 So ATP in cytochrome C is going to give you ATP.

1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:10.560
 Now that's a great thing,

1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:13.280
 but it creates a by-product.

1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:16.080
 It breaks things down such that you get these ROSs,

1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:18.080
 these reactive oxygen species.

1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:19.860
 And those reactive oxygen species,

1:52:19.860 --> 1:52:21.160
 for those of you that want to know,

1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:23.860
 are involved in things like redox signaling

1:52:23.860 --> 1:52:27.280
 and reactive oxygen species actually change

1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:29.560
 which genes are made in a cell.

1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:32.400
 So the goal of any treatment to keep neurons

1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:35.840
 or other cells youthful and functioning well,

1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:38.880
 and to prevent or reverse aging

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.320
 is going to be to increase ATP

1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:44.160
 and to reduce reactive oxygen species.

1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:48.480
 And in doing so, to disrupt some of the normal pathways

1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:50.220
 associated with aging.

1:52:51.860 --> 1:52:53.600
 The Jeffrey Lab approached these studies

1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:55.800
 with that understanding of how mitochondria

1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:58.700
 and reactive oxygen species and ATP work.

1:52:58.700 --> 1:53:01.560
 And what they did was exquisitely simple

1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:02.880
 to the point of being elegant.

1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:05.240
 And what they found was really, really exciting.

1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:09.200
 What they did is they had people, subjects

1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:11.420
 that were either younger, so in their 20s,

1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:14.000
 or 40 years old or older,

1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:18.000
 view red light of about 670 nanometers.

1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:21.500
 670 nanometers would appear red to you and me.

1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:23.640
 They had them do that, excuse me,

1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:25.600
 at a distance that was safe for their eyes.

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:27.720
 So at about a foot away.

1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:31.700
 Now, a foot away from a very intense red light

1:53:31.700 --> 1:53:32.960
 could actually be damaging to the eye.

1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:35.200
 So they had them do this at about a foot away

1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:37.960
 from a red light that was of low enough intensity

1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:39.960
 that did not damage the eyes.

1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:41.280
 And they had them do that anywhere

1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:44.120
 from two to three minutes per day.

1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:45.840
 And in one study, they had them do that

1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:48.360
 for a long period of time of about 12 weeks.

1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:49.760
 And in the other study, they had them do that

1:53:49.760 --> 1:53:51.680
 just for a couple of weeks.

1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:54.560
 What's remarkable is that when you collapse the results

1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.080
 across these two studies,

1:53:56.080 --> 1:53:58.660
 what they found is that when looking at these subjects

1:53:58.660 --> 1:54:02.880
 ranging from 28 years old to about 72 years old,

1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:07.880
 the major findings were that in individuals 40 years old

1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:12.920
 or older, so in the 40 to 72 year old bracket,

1:54:12.920 --> 1:54:16.600
 but not in the subjects younger than 40 years old,

1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:20.120
 they saw an improvement in visual function.

1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:21.480
 That improvement in visual function

1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:23.760
 was an improvement in visual acuity,

1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:26.880
 meaning the ability to resolve fine detail

1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:30.500
 and using a particular measure of visual function,

1:54:30.500 --> 1:54:35.500
 which is called the Tritan exam, T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan exam,

1:54:36.900 --> 1:54:40.320
 which specifically addresses the function

1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:42.360
 of the so-called short wavelength cones,

1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:45.000
 the ones that respond to green and blue light,

1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:48.840
 they saw a 22% improvement in visual acuity,

1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:52.240
 which in the landscape of visual testing

1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:55.540
 is an extremely exciting result, okay?

1:54:55.540 --> 1:54:59.220
 So I think in most studies of improvements of vision,

1:54:59.220 --> 1:55:03.320
 you'd be very excited to see an improvement of 5% or 10%.

1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:06.520
 So a 22% improvement in visual acuity,

1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:08.980
 even though it's in this very specific form

1:55:08.980 --> 1:55:12.700
 of visual testing, this Tritan exam or this Tritan score,

1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:16.000
 well, that turns out to be very significant

1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.200
 and translates to the real world in an important way.

1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:23.080
 In particular, as we age,

1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:26.120
 we tend to lose certain neurons within our retina,

1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.520
 but we don't tend to lose cones.

1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:30.180
 We tend to lose rods.

1:55:30.180 --> 1:55:32.280
 We tend to lose other cells within the retina,

1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:34.240
 including the cells that connect the eye to the brain,

1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:35.800
 the so-called ganglion cells.

1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:37.600
 Cones, for whatever reason,

1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:40.200
 are pretty resilient to age-related loss.

1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:44.480
 However, because rods and cones both

1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:47.720
 are not just among the most metabolically active cells

1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:49.120
 in your entire body,

1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:52.960
 but the most metabolically active cells in your entire body.

1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:56.200
 That's right, your rods and cones are the cells that demand

1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:59.860
 and that use the most energy of all the cells in your body.

1:56:00.940 --> 1:56:02.520
 Not your skin cells, not your spleen cells,

1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:03.720
 not your stomach cells.

1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:04.920
 Even if you talk a lot,

1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:07.140
 not the cells that are responsible for moving your mouth,

1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:09.680
 it is the rods and cones of your neural retina

1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:12.680
 that are responsible for using the most amount

1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.640
 of ATP and energy in your entire body.

1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:16.960
 And because of that,

1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:19.080
 those cells tend to accumulate

1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:22.280
 a lot of reactive oxygen species as we age.

1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:25.360
 Red light of the sort used in these studies

1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:29.920
 was able to reduce the amount of reactive oxygen species

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:31.360
 in the rods and cones,

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:35.200
 and to rescue the function of this particular cone type,

1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:37.020
 the short wavelength and medium wavelength cones,

1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:38.480
 which if you think about the study

1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:39.720
 is a little bit surprising

1:56:39.720 --> 1:56:42.360
 because it was red light and near infrared light,

1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:44.880
 not short wavelength light that was used

1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:48.520
 in order to create this improvement in cellular function.

1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:50.960
 But if you step back a little bit further,

1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:52.360
 it makes perfect sense

1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:55.800
 because there's nothing specific about the red light

1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:57.920
 in the sense that it's not that it gets delivered

1:56:57.920 --> 1:56:59.560
 only to red cones.

1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:01.480
 That red light and near infrared light

1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:04.660
 is being absorbed by all the photoreceptors within the eye,

1:57:04.660 --> 1:57:07.600
 the rods and the blue cones and the green cones

1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:08.440
 and the red cones.

1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:11.760
 It's just that the red cones absorb that light best.

1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:14.560
 So the important takeaway here

1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.840
 is that viewing red light and near infrared light

1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:19.760
 at a distance at which it is safe

1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:22.420
 for just a couple of minutes each day

1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:25.920
 allowed a reversal of the aging process of these neurons,

1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:28.640
 which some people have heard me say before

1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:30.320
 and I'll just say it again,

1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:32.200
 the retina, including your photoreceptors

1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:34.160
 are not just connected to your brain,

1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:35.280
 they're not just near your brain,

1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:37.400
 they are actual central nervous system tissue.

1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:39.540
 They are the only two pieces of your brain,

1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:40.680
 meaning your neural retinas

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:41.920
 are the only two pieces of your brain

1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:43.300
 that reside outside your skull

1:57:43.300 --> 1:57:45.000
 or at least outside the cranial vault.

1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:48.280
 So here we're seeing a reversal of the aging process

1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:51.560
 in neurons by shining red light on those neurons.

1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:54.060
 Now, of course, the Jeffrey lab

1:57:54.060 --> 1:57:55.720
 is primarily interested in vision

1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:58.040
 and humans are most dependent on vision

1:57:58.040 --> 1:57:59.860
 as a sense to navigate the world and survive.

1:57:59.860 --> 1:58:01.240
 So this is really wonderful.

1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:03.040
 Here we're looking at a therapy

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:06.560
 that can reverse age-related vision loss,

1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:08.680
 at least in some individuals.

1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:09.580
 But as you can imagine,

1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:10.960
 the study was also done on these cells

1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:13.080
 because they reside outside the skull

1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:15.320
 and you can shine light directly on them, right?

1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:16.980
 I'm sure that there are many people out there

1:58:16.980 --> 1:58:19.480
 who are interested in how they can improve the function,

1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:22.640
 say, of the neurons in their brain responsible for memory.

1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:23.460
 And in a few minutes,

1:58:23.460 --> 1:58:27.040
 I'll describe the non-invasive applications of light

1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:31.100
 to try and restore the function of those cells as well.

1:58:31.100 --> 1:58:35.000
 So a little bit more about the studies from the Jeffrey lab.

1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:37.580
 One of the things that they observed

1:58:37.580 --> 1:58:41.760
 was a reduction in so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.

1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:45.760
 Drusen are little fatty deposits,

1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:47.440
 little cholesterol deposits

1:58:47.440 --> 1:58:49.880
 that accumulate in the eye as we age.

1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:51.540
 We've all heard about cholesterol

1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:53.080
 within our veins and arteries

1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:55.660
 and how that can clog our veins and arteries

1:58:55.660 --> 1:58:57.280
 and how, of course,

1:58:57.280 --> 1:58:59.760
 clogging of veins and arteries is not a good thing.

1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:02.540
 Well, our neural retina being so metabolically active

1:59:02.540 --> 1:59:04.140
 requires a lot of blood flow.

1:59:04.140 --> 1:59:06.140
 It's heavily vascularized.

1:59:06.140 --> 1:59:09.080
 And drusen are a special form of cholesterol

1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:11.240
 that accumulate in the eye.

1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:12.080
 As it turns out,

1:59:12.080 --> 1:59:15.040
 these red light and near infrared light therapies

1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:16.480
 explored by the Jeffrey lab

1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:19.560
 were able to actually reduce or reverse

1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:21.600
 some of the accumulation of drusen.

1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:25.640
 And so in addition to reducing reactive oxygen species,

1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:27.980
 the idea in mind now is that red light

1:59:27.980 --> 1:59:31.520
 may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:34.080
 and reactive oxygen species

1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:36.520
 in order to improve neuronal function.

1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:38.720
 So what should you and I do with these results?

1:59:38.720 --> 1:59:40.240
 Or should we do anything with these results?

1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:42.220
 Well, first of all, I want to emphasize

1:59:42.220 --> 1:59:44.680
 that even though these studies are very exciting,

1:59:44.680 --> 1:59:45.920
 they are fairly recent.

1:59:45.920 --> 1:59:48.960
 And so more data as always are needed.

1:59:48.960 --> 1:59:50.640
 There's some additional features of these studies

1:59:50.640 --> 1:59:52.600
 that I think are also important to consider.

1:59:52.600 --> 1:59:54.000
 First of all,

1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:58.360
 the exposure to red light needed to happen early in the day,

1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:00.860
 at least within the first three hours of waking.

2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:03.120
 How would one do that?

2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:04.040
 Well, nowadays,

2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:06.600
 there are a number of different red light panels

2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:08.880
 and different red light sources

2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:11.740
 that certainly fall within the range of red light

2:00:11.740 --> 2:00:14.260
 and near infrared light that one could use.

2:00:14.260 --> 2:00:17.680
 I don't have any affiliation to any companies or products

2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:21.640
 that promote or make those red light therapies.

2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:23.380
 I do own a red light panel.

2:00:23.380 --> 2:00:25.920
 So I confess I have started using this protocol.

2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:27.800
 I am older than 40 years old.

2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:30.880
 I also have been experimenting with these red light panels

2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:35.500
 as a way of addressing other changes in biological tissues

2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:37.140
 for which I'm doing blood work, et cetera.

2:00:37.140 --> 2:00:39.480
 And I'm going to talk about that in a future episode.

2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:41.560
 But that of course is what I call anacodata.

2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:43.180
 It only relates to my experience.

2:00:43.180 --> 2:00:44.800
 So today,

2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:47.720
 and certainly on all episodes of the Human Lab Podcast,

2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:50.720
 we emphasize peer reviewed studies almost exclusively

2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:53.440
 talking about anacodata only when highlighting it

2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:54.840
 as anacodata.

2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:58.560
 So if you're somebody who wants to explore red light therapy

2:00:58.560 --> 2:00:59.600
 here's what you need to do.

2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:02.120
 You need to make sure that that red light source,

2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:04.160
 whatever source you happen to use,

2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:05.520
 whether or not you purchase it or make one.

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.280
 And in fact, these red light sources

2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:08.860
 are very, very easy to make.

2:01:08.860 --> 2:01:11.600
 You could essentially take a bright flashlight

2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:14.120
 and cover it with a film or a filter

2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:17.420
 that would only allow particular long wavelengths

2:01:17.420 --> 2:01:18.260
 to pass through.

2:01:18.260 --> 2:01:19.880
 This would be very easy to look up online

2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:20.720
 and figure out how to do this.

2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:23.560
 You could probably do this for just a few dollars

2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:25.520
 or you could purchase a red light unit

2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:27.480
 if that was within your budget

2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:29.000
 and something that you're interested in.

2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:30.840
 You want to make sure that it's not so bright

2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:32.600
 that you're damaging your eye.

2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:33.600
 A good rule of thumb

2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:35.920
 is that something isn't painful to look at.

2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:37.400
 And in fact, I should just emphasize

2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:39.560
 that anytime you look at any light source,

2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:40.800
 sunlight or otherwise,

2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:42.400
 that it's painful and makes you want to squint

2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:43.240
 or close your eyes.

2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:44.900
 That means it's too bright to look at

2:01:44.900 --> 2:01:46.000
 without closing your eyes.

2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.420
 Okay, that's sort of a duh,

2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:49.520
 but I would loathe to think that anyone

2:01:49.520 --> 2:01:51.760
 would harm themselves with bright light in any way.

2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:52.980
 I don't just say that to protect us.

2:01:52.980 --> 2:01:54.880
 I say that to protect you, of course,

2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:56.720
 because you are responsible for your health.

2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.320
 And again, retinal neurons do not regenerate.

2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:02.160
 Once they are gone and dead, they do not come back.

2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:03.780
 There's no technology to replace them

2:02:03.780 --> 2:02:06.280
 at this current state in time.

2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:08.400
 So please don't damage your retinas.

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:10.840
 So is a red light source safe to look at

2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:13.480
 if it is not painful to look at?

2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:14.560
 Chances are it is.

2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:16.040
 And yet I would still encourage you

2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:19.220
 to talk to your optometrist or ophthalmologist

2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:21.940
 before getting into any extensive protocols.

2:02:21.940 --> 2:02:24.100
 But if you were still determined to pursue

2:02:24.100 --> 2:02:26.320
 the sorts of protocols that are in the Jeffrey studies,

2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:28.440
 certainly we'll provide a link to those studies.

2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:31.160
 Again, it involves looking at these red light panels,

2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:36.160
 blinking aloud for two minutes to three minutes,

2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:40.760
 every morning for a period of two weeks or more.

2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:44.820
 And if you're older than 40,

2:02:44.820 --> 2:02:46.200
 that could very well have an effect.

2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:48.520
 If you're younger than 40, excuse me,

2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:50.680
 that's unlikely to have an effect.

2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:52.460
 At least that was what was observed

2:02:52.460 --> 2:02:54.080
 in these particular studies.

2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:55.520
 The lights were not flashing.

2:02:55.520 --> 2:02:57.220
 It was continuous illumination.

2:02:57.220 --> 2:02:58.800
 Again, you're allowed to blink.

2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:00.800
 It does not have to even be direct illumination.

2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:02.460
 It can be somewhat indirect illumination,

2:03:02.460 --> 2:03:06.220
 much as we described for the use of UVB light before.

2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:08.200
 The wavelength of light is important.

2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:10.180
 It is red light and near-infrared light

2:03:10.180 --> 2:03:14.000
 that is going to be effective in this scenario.

2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:15.640
 The authors of this study emphasized

2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:20.240
 that it was red light of 670 nanometers in wavelength

2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:25.240
 and near-infrared light of 790 nanometers in wavelength

2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:26.840
 that were effective,

2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:29.720
 and that those wavelengths could be complimentary.

2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:33.200
 That's probably why, or maybe it's just coincidental,

2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:35.240
 but it's a fortunate coincidence

2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:37.680
 that a lot of the commercially available red light panels

2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:38.520
 that you'll find out there

2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:41.480
 combine both red light and near-infrared light.

2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:44.280
 However, I want to emphasize that most of the panels

2:03:44.280 --> 2:03:46.080
 that are commercially available

2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:50.480
 are going to be too bright to safely look at very close up.

2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:53.000
 And in fact, that's why most of those red light panels

2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:54.960
 are designed for illumination of the skin

2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:57.480
 and oftentimes arrive in their packaging

2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:00.040
 with eye protectors that are actually designed

2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:01.760
 to shield out all the red light.

2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:06.220
 So take the potential dangers of excessive illumination

2:04:06.220 --> 2:04:09.240
 of the eyes with any wavelength of light seriously,

2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:12.800
 but if you're going to explore 670 and 790 nanometer light

2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:16.340
 for sake of enhancing neuronal function,

2:04:16.340 --> 2:04:18.640
 set it at a distance that's comfortable to look at

2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:20.340
 and that doesn't force you to squint

2:04:20.340 --> 2:04:22.960
 or doesn't make you feel uncomfortable physically

2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:24.320
 as if you need to turn away

2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:27.800
 during the period of that two to three minute illumination

2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:28.640
 each day.

2:04:30.220 --> 2:04:32.400
 In terms of turning away from light,

2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:36.000
 I'll just briefly mention that that is not an accident

2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:37.760
 or a coincidence that you have that response

2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:38.980
 to very bright light.

2:04:38.980 --> 2:04:41.960
 There is a so-called photic avoidance pathway

2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.640
 that involves cells within your retina,

2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:45.260
 these ganglion cells that communicate

2:04:45.260 --> 2:04:48.120
 with yet another brain station,

2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.880
 a certain area of your thalamus

2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:52.400
 that communicate to areas of your brain

2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:53.560
 that are associated with pain.

2:04:53.560 --> 2:04:55.320
 So literally that can trigger headache

2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:57.480
 and that can trigger the squint reflex.

2:04:58.380 --> 2:05:00.420
 Biology is just beautiful in this way.

2:05:00.420 --> 2:05:03.480
 Too much light is bad for us in that it can damage our eyes

2:05:03.480 --> 2:05:05.160
 and other aspects of our body.

2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:07.380
 So if we look at a light that's too bright,

2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:08.980
 our eyes send a signal to the brain

2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:10.360
 that gives us a sort of a headache

2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:12.100
 and a desire to squint and turn away.

2:05:12.100 --> 2:05:14.040
 So that can be a useful guide

2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:16.680
 in terms of gauging how bright a light should be

2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:19.960
 or at least how far away you should be from a bright source

2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:23.080
 in order to safely engage with that light source.

2:05:23.080 --> 2:05:25.880
 So the studies I just described, once again,

2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:27.980
 involve the use of red light early in the day

2:05:27.980 --> 2:05:29.400
 within three hours of waking

2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:31.760
 and are for the sake of improving neuronal function.

2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:35.760
 Red light has also been shown to be beneficial

2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:38.160
 late in the day and even in the middle of the night.

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:40.280
 And when I say middle of the night,

2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:43.080
 I'm referring to studies that explore the use of red light

2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:44.600
 for shift workers.

2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:46.380
 I know that most people are not working

2:05:46.380 --> 2:05:48.040
 in the middle of the night, at least I hope they're not,

2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:50.440
 but some of you may do that from time to time.

2:05:50.440 --> 2:05:51.920
 All-nighters for studying, I confess,

2:05:51.920 --> 2:05:53.580
 I still pull all-nighters every once in a while

2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:57.160
 to prepare things like podcasts and other deadlines,

2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:59.760
 really try not to, happens less and less as I get older

2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:01.640
 because I think I get more disciplined

2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:04.960
 and or less good at pulling all-nighters.

2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:07.360
 But I realized that many people are doing shift work

2:06:07.360 --> 2:06:09.760
 or they have to work certainly past 10 PM

2:06:09.760 --> 2:06:11.600
 or maybe they're taking care of young children

2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:14.040
 in the middle of the night and they have to be up.

2:06:14.040 --> 2:06:16.400
 In that case, red light can actually be very beneficial.

2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:17.920
 And nowadays there are a lot of sources

2:06:17.920 --> 2:06:20.840
 of red light available just as red light bulbs.

2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:21.940
 You don't need a panel.

2:06:21.940 --> 2:06:25.220
 So what I'm basically saying is that it can be beneficial

2:06:25.220 --> 2:06:28.080
 to use red lights at night.

2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:30.160
 The study I'd like to emphasize in this context

2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:31.880
 is entitled Red Light,

2:06:31.880 --> 2:06:34.160
 a novel non-pharmacological intervention

2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:36.800
 to promote alertness in shift workers.

2:06:36.800 --> 2:06:38.000
 So beautiful study.

2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:41.360
 They explored the use of different wavelengths of light.

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:45.260
 So blue light of 460 nanometers or red light

2:06:45.260 --> 2:06:49.480
 or dim white light of different brightnesses, et cetera,

2:06:49.480 --> 2:06:52.720
 and looked at things like melatonin.

2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:55.160
 How much does light of a given color

2:06:55.160 --> 2:06:56.800
 and intensity suppress melatonin?

2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:58.600
 They looked at cortisol, a stress hormone.

2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:00.320
 They looked at wakefulness.

2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:03.600
 How much or to what degree could a given color of light

2:07:03.600 --> 2:07:06.220
 increase wakefulness at different hours of the day?

2:07:06.220 --> 2:07:08.320
 The takeaway from this study is very clear.

2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:10.540
 If you need to be awake late at night

2:07:10.540 --> 2:07:12.320
 for sake of shift work or studying

2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:14.760
 or taking care of children, et cetera,

2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:17.520
 red light is going to be your best choice

2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:21.220
 because if the red light is sufficiently dim,

2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:25.000
 it's not going to inhibit melatonin production

2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:28.080
 and it's not going to increase cortisol at night.

2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:30.800
 Cortisol should be high early in the day

2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:31.960
 or at least should be elevated

2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:34.500
 relative to other times of day if you are healthy.

2:07:34.500 --> 2:07:36.420
 A late shifted increase in cortisol,

2:07:36.420 --> 2:07:39.040
 however, 9 p.m. cortisol, 10 p.m. cortisol

2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:42.100
 is well known to be associated with depression

2:07:42.100 --> 2:07:44.480
 and other aspects of mental health,

2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:46.360
 or I should say mental illness.

2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:50.100
 So if you do need to be awake at night or even all night,

2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:53.620
 red light is going to be the preferred light source.

2:07:53.620 --> 2:07:55.360
 And in terms of how bright to make it,

2:07:55.360 --> 2:07:59.000
 well, as dim as you can while still being able

2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:00.840
 to perform the activities that you need to perform,

2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:03.040
 that's going to be your best guide.

2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:05.420
 I'll provide a link to this study as well.

2:08:05.420 --> 2:08:08.120
 Again, it's a really important study

2:08:08.120 --> 2:08:10.320
 because it emphasized that there are forms of light,

2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:12.240
 red light, provided it's dim,

2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:15.400
 that can allow you to stimulate the alertness

2:08:15.400 --> 2:08:19.080
 that light landing on the eyes can provide.

2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:20.200
 So it allows you to stay awake

2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:22.520
 and to do whatever work that you need to do.

2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:26.040
 It does not seem to alter melatonin production.

2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:26.860
 So that's good.

2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:28.880
 It does not seem to alter levels

2:08:28.880 --> 2:08:31.000
 or timing of cortisol production.

2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.680
 So yet another case where red light used correctly

2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:35.800
 can be beneficial.

2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:37.760
 Up until now, we've been talking about the effects

2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:40.160
 of shining different wavelengths of light

2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:43.120
 on the skin or on our eyes

2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:45.640
 and the downstream health consequences

2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:47.560
 of that illumination.

2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:49.560
 However, one of the most important goals

2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:52.000
 of science and medicine is to figure out

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.600
 how to change the health of our brain.

2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:58.240
 And of course, our brain is contained within our skull

2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:01.160
 and therefore we can't just shine light

2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:03.440
 onto the outside of our head

2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:05.360
 and expect it to change the activity

2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:07.000
 of neurons deep within the brain

2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:10.100
 unless those neurons are linked up

2:09:10.100 --> 2:09:12.580
 with our eyes or with our skin.

2:09:12.580 --> 2:09:13.520
 And as it turns out,

2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:15.480
 even though there are a lot of brain areas

2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:17.680
 that are connected through neural circuits

2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:19.580
 and hormone circuits through our eye

2:09:19.580 --> 2:09:22.240
 and believe it or not, also to our skin,

2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:24.140
 many brain areas are not.

2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:27.800
 Brain areas such as the hippocampus,

2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:30.220
 which is involved in learning and memory,

2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:33.180
 brain areas such as our neocortex.

2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:34.840
 Well, some areas of our neocortex,

2:09:34.840 --> 2:09:36.460
 such as our visual cortex,

2:09:36.460 --> 2:09:38.400
 are indirectly linked to our eyes.

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:39.600
 So if we shine light on our eyes,

2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:42.420
 we can change the activity of neurons in our neocortex.

2:09:42.420 --> 2:09:46.520
 But there are other brain areas that are not directly

2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:50.060
 or even indirectly connected to our visual system,

2:09:50.060 --> 2:09:53.080
 not at least in any immediate way.

2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:55.040
 So that raises the question of how do you change

2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:56.400
 the activity of neurons in the brain?

2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:58.080
 Well, there's pharmacology.

2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:01.060
 You can take pills, you can inject drugs

2:10:01.060 --> 2:10:02.860
 that will change the pharmacology of neurons

2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:04.800
 and the way they operate in fire.

2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:07.760
 Of course, antidepressants are one such instance.

2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:09.720
 Opioid drugs are another.

2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:12.720
 There's a huge array of psychoactive compounds,

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:14.720
 meaning compounds that will change the levels

2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:16.760
 of chemicals in your brain.

2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:20.700
 Some of those work, many of them also carry side effects.

2:10:20.700 --> 2:10:22.540
 It's all rather indirect,

2:10:22.540 --> 2:10:24.320
 meaning you have lots of different cells

2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:25.300
 in different areas of your brain

2:10:25.300 --> 2:10:26.640
 that utilize the same chemicals.

2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:29.060
 So a drug, for instance, to increase serotonin

2:10:29.060 --> 2:10:31.520
 for sake of improving depression

2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:34.760
 will also often have the effect of reducing

2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:38.980
 certain neurons output of serotonin in the hippocampus

2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:41.280
 and cause changes in appetite or changes in libido

2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:42.480
 and so on and so forth.

2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:45.260
 You could imagine using electrical stimulation,

2:10:45.260 --> 2:10:46.420
 putting wires into the brain

2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:48.520
 and stimulating specific brain areas

2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:51.320
 in order to activate the neurons in those brain areas.

2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:53.960
 And certainly that works and has been done experimentally

2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:56.860
 and is done during neurosurgery exams, et cetera,

2:10:56.860 --> 2:10:59.600
 but involves removing a piece of skull.

2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:01.320
 So that's not very practical.

2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:04.360
 In principle, light would be a wonderful way

2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:08.480
 to modulate the activity of neurons deep within the brain.

2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:10.320
 But again, the skull is in the way.

2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:14.400
 Recent studies, however, have figured out ways

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:16.720
 that light can be delivered to the eyes

2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:20.200
 to change global patterns of firing in the brain

2:11:20.200 --> 2:11:22.640
 in ways that can be beneficial to the brain.

2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:25.480
 And the work that I'm referring to now

2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:28.560
 is mainly the work of Liwei Tsai at MIT,

2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:32.160
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her colleagues.

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:33.720
 And what they've discovered is that

2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:36.840
 there's a particular pattern of brain activity

2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:38.940
 called gamma activity.

2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:42.080
 Gamma activity is one so-called wavelength

2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:44.200
 of electrical activity in the brain.

2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:45.220
 So not wavelengths of light,

2:11:45.220 --> 2:11:47.980
 but wavelengths of electrical activity in the brain

2:11:47.980 --> 2:11:50.520
 that can be restorative for certain aspects

2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:51.560
 of learning and memory

2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:55.160
 and can actually help create molecular changes in neurons

2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:57.600
 that lead to clearance of debris

2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:01.760
 and even reductions in age-related cognitive decline.

2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:04.760
 So the way to think about brain waves

2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:08.040
 and brain oscillations is that neurons

2:12:08.040 --> 2:12:11.120
 are electrically active, that involves chemicals, et cetera.

2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:15.200
 And they can be active in very slow, big wave forms.

2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:17.840
 So you can think of delta waves,

2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:20.400
 meaning so you can imagine a wave of electrical activity

2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:22.200
 that comes along very infrequently.

2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:24.160
 So a given neuron fires

2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:26.920
 and then some period of time later fires

2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:29.680
 and then some period of time even later fires.

2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:32.520
 Or you can imagine that that same cell is very active,

2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:34.340
 fires, fires, fires, fires, fires.

2:12:34.340 --> 2:12:36.000
 You can imagine if it's firing very often,

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.400
 it's going to be short wavelength, right?

2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:40.340
 Shorter gaps between firing,

2:12:40.340 --> 2:12:43.560
 or if it's firing very seldom,

2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:45.480
 you're going to think about that

2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:47.280
 as longer wavelength firing.

2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:51.020
 Turns out that gamma waves are one pattern of firing

2:12:51.020 --> 2:12:54.760
 that lead to downstream metabolic functions

2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:57.340
 and biological functions that end up clearing away debris

2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:00.220
 that's associated with aging in cells.

2:13:00.220 --> 2:13:03.280
 And that also lead to molecular changes

2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:06.400
 that enhance the kind of youthfulness of neurons,

2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:07.240
 so to speak.

2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:12.400
 How do we induce gamma oscillations within the brain?

2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:15.680
 Well, what Liwei, Tsai and colleagues

2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:18.320
 have beautifully shown is that

2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:22.040
 by delivering certain patterns of light flicker,

2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:25.320
 so lights going on and off at a particular frequency,

2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:28.480
 the brain as a whole starts to entrain,

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:30.860
 meaning it matches to those particular patterns

2:13:30.860 --> 2:13:31.700
 of light flicker,

2:13:31.700 --> 2:13:34.400
 even though many of the brain areas that do this

2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:38.720
 are not directly within the visual system or visual pathway.

2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:42.080
 So the studies that I'm referred to are several,

2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:43.960
 but the one that I'd like to highlight is entitled

2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:46.820
 Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher Order Brain Regions

2:13:46.820 --> 2:13:49.160
 and Offers Neuroprotection.

2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:52.560
 What they essentially did was to expose subjects

2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:56.640
 to 40 Hertz, which is a particular frequency

2:13:56.640 --> 2:13:59.160
 of illumination to the eyes.

2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:01.360
 So it's light goes on, light goes off,

2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:06.200
 light goes on, light goes off at a frequency of 40 Hertz.

2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:07.480
 And when they did that,

2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:10.360
 and they recorded the activity of neurons within the brain,

2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:12.920
 not just within the visual areas of the brain,

2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:14.840
 but within other areas as well,

2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:18.820
 they observed increased gamma oscillations,

2:14:18.820 --> 2:14:23.040
 meaning that the electrical activity of the brain at large

2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:26.080
 started to match to the patterns of light

2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:27.980
 that were delivered to the eyes.

2:14:27.980 --> 2:14:29.720
 This is really exciting and very unique

2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:31.620
 from the different types of phototherapies

2:14:31.620 --> 2:14:33.200
 that we've been talking about up until now.

2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:35.080
 All the patterns of phototherapy

2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:36.680
 that we've been talking about up until now

2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:39.320
 involved constant illumination with a given wavelength.

2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:44.320
 Here, it is wavelength generating patterns of illumination,

2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:46.600
 light on, light off, light on, light off

2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:48.480
 at a particular frequency.

2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:49.740
 So what they found, for instance,

2:14:49.740 --> 2:14:51.200
 using this pattern of stimulation,

2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:53.640
 and by the way, the stimulation was called GENUS,

2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:56.160
 Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory Stimulation,

2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:00.000
 so G-E-N-U-S, Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory Stimulation,

2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:01.560
 had a number of really interesting effects.

2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:04.920
 First of all, it reduced so-called amyloid plaques

2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:06.680
 and phosphorylated tau.

2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:08.360
 Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau

2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:09.760
 are associated with Alzheimer's

2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:12.840
 and normal age-related cognitive decline.

2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:14.620
 So this is incredible, right?

2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:19.240
 A pattern of flashing light delivered to the eyes

2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:21.360
 creates a pattern of neuronal firing,

2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:23.120
 not just in the visual areas of the brain,

2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:25.600
 but in other areas of the brain as well,

2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:28.720
 that in turn trigger molecular pathways

2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:32.000
 that reduce some of the markers

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.460
 and the cause of age-related cognitive decline

2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:37.200
 in Alzheimer's, and in parallel to that,

2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:39.120
 they observed an upregulation

2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:41.300
 of some of the biological pathways

2:15:41.300 --> 2:15:43.500
 that lead to enhancement of neuronal function,

2:15:43.500 --> 2:15:44.620
 maintenance of synapses,

2:15:44.620 --> 2:15:46.480
 which are the connections between neurons,

2:15:46.480 --> 2:15:48.320
 and so on and so on.

2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:50.820
 They have discovered and list out a huge number

2:15:50.820 --> 2:15:52.400
 of these biological effects,

2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:55.280
 both the reduction in bad things, so to speak,

2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:59.080
 and the improvement in good biological pathways.

2:15:59.080 --> 2:16:02.880
 And I find these studies so exciting because,

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:05.560
 first of all, they're noninvasive, right?

2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:07.520
 There's no drilling through the skull.

2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:11.760
 They are very tractable and in the experimental sense,

2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:14.020
 meaning that you could imagine

2:16:14.020 --> 2:16:15.920
 that if 40 hertz stimulation turns out

2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:17.820
 to be the very best stimulation protocol

2:16:17.820 --> 2:16:20.360
 to induce these gamma oscillations, well, great,

2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:22.280
 but because it's noninvasive,

2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:25.080
 it's fairly easy to explore 50 hertz stimulation,

2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:27.480
 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation,

2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:30.540
 and to do that with different wavelengths of light.

2:16:30.540 --> 2:16:31.780
 And so that's what's happening now.

2:16:31.780 --> 2:16:33.600
 The PSI lab and other labs are really starting

2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:36.680
 to explore the full range of variables

2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:39.680
 that can impact oscillations within the brain

2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:41.440
 and their downstream consequences.

2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:43.600
 So again, this is phototherapy,

2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:45.400
 but phototherapy of a very different sort

2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:47.840
 that we've been talking about up until now.

2:16:47.840 --> 2:16:50.920
 It's phototherapy designed to trigger activation

2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:53.360
 of biological pathways far away

2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:55.240
 from the very tissue that's being illuminated.

2:16:55.240 --> 2:16:57.320
 And it calls to mind the same sorts of mechanisms

2:16:57.320 --> 2:16:58.320
 that we were talking about earlier,

2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:00.840
 where illumination of the skin with UVB light

2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:03.120
 is setting off an enormous number of different cascades

2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:05.680
 in different organs and tissues, including the spleen,

2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:08.140
 the testes, the ovaries, and so on.

2:17:08.140 --> 2:17:11.760
 So again, light has these powerful effects,

2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:15.060
 both locally on the cells that light is delivered to,

2:17:15.060 --> 2:17:18.440
 but also systemically in terms of the cells

2:17:18.440 --> 2:17:21.680
 that are changing their electrical and chemical outputs

2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:24.720
 are modifying lots and lots of biological programs.

2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:27.920
 Is there an actionable tool related to these studies yet?

2:17:27.920 --> 2:17:30.260
 Well, that sort of depends on how adventurous you are.

2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:32.860
 Right now, these studies are being explored

2:17:32.860 --> 2:17:34.500
 in the context of clinical trials

2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:36.300
 in people with Alzheimer's dementia

2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:39.360
 and other forms of neuronal degeneration.

2:17:40.300 --> 2:17:44.080
 Is it dangerous to look at a 40 Hertz flickering light?

2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:46.820
 Well, in general, the answer is going to be no.

2:17:46.820 --> 2:17:49.960
 However, if you're prone to epilepsy, for instance,

2:17:49.960 --> 2:17:52.700
 staring at a flickering light of a given continuous

2:17:52.700 --> 2:17:55.180
 frequency can induce seizure, right?

2:17:55.180 --> 2:17:57.680
 That might surprise some of you, but it shouldn't,

2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:00.040
 because as this study illustrates,

2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:03.100
 and as anyone who's ever been out at night to a club

2:18:03.100 --> 2:18:04.520
 or something illustrates,

2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:07.800
 when you look at a strobe light, for instance,

2:18:07.800 --> 2:18:09.920
 your whole world of visual perception changes,

2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:13.200
 but actually the rhythm at which you perceive music,

2:18:13.200 --> 2:18:14.420
 at which you perceive conversation,

2:18:14.420 --> 2:18:16.200
 at which you perceive the movement of your body

2:18:16.200 --> 2:18:19.720
 actually changes according to the patterns of visual flicker

2:18:19.720 --> 2:18:21.160
 in most cases strobe,

2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:24.800
 if we're using the sort of club dancing example,

2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:28.080
 your brain is in training to its outside environment.

2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:30.820
 So given the power of flickering lights

2:18:30.820 --> 2:18:34.400
 to entrain brain rhythms, I think at this stage,

2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:37.400
 it's probably too preliminary to really suggest

2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:41.400
 a specific protocol, but I would definitely keep an eye out

2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:43.700
 for these sorts of studies.

2:18:43.700 --> 2:18:45.280
 They are coming out all the time.

2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:47.920
 And I think in a very short period,

2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:50.420
 we're going to see specific protocols

2:18:50.420 --> 2:18:53.020
 that one could potentially use even at home.

2:18:53.020 --> 2:18:54.920
 And of course, these are non-invasive protocols

2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:58.700
 in order to place the brain into a particular state,

2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:01.540
 not just for sake of offsetting neurodegeneration,

2:19:01.540 --> 2:19:03.880
 but also for enhancing focus,

2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:05.920
 for enhancing the transition into sleep

2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:07.640
 and other brain states as well.

2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:11.240
 Today, I covered what I would say is a lot of information.

2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:13.000
 My goal was to give you an understanding

2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.780
 of how light can be used to change the activities of cells

2:19:17.780 --> 2:19:21.420
 organelles within those cells, entire organs,

2:19:21.420 --> 2:19:25.900
 and how that can happen locally and systemically.

2:19:25.900 --> 2:19:28.520
 We talked about the power of light to impact our biology

2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:31.600
 at the endocrine level, neuronal level, immune level,

2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:35.960
 mood, et cetera, through both illumination of the eyes

2:19:35.960 --> 2:19:38.700
 and the skin and other tissues as well.

2:19:38.700 --> 2:19:42.360
 I realized that even though this was a lot of information,

2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:46.380
 there are many aspects of phototherapy that I did not cover.

2:19:46.380 --> 2:19:48.520
 I know there's a lot of interest nowadays, for instance,

2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:52.160
 in the use of red light and other wavelength light therapies

2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:55.420
 for ovarian health and testicular health.

2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:59.120
 In fact, I get a lot of questions such as,

2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:02.200
 can red light be used to improve testosterone output?

2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.720
 And if so, is that best accomplished by shining red light

2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:09.520
 on the skin or directly on the gonads, on the testicles?

2:20:09.520 --> 2:20:13.460
 I'm going to cover those data at a future time.

2:20:13.460 --> 2:20:16.240
 Right now, the studies that have been done in rodents,

2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:19.160
 I don't think are easily enough translated to humans.

2:20:19.160 --> 2:20:21.480
 And the studies that are happening in humans now

2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:24.520
 are exciting in the sense that they hold a lot of potential,

2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:27.560
 but the data aren't clear yet.

2:20:27.560 --> 2:20:32.560
 However, the data using UVB on the skin of men and women

2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:35.680
 in order to increase hormone, in particular,

2:20:35.680 --> 2:20:37.200
 testosterone and estrogen output,

2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:40.240
 those data I think are very exciting and very actionable.

2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:41.980
 We talked about those earlier.

2:20:41.980 --> 2:20:43.860
 So if you want more information

2:20:43.860 --> 2:20:45.600
 on how phototherapy can be used,

2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:48.780
 certainly we will do another episode on phototherapy

2:20:48.780 --> 2:20:50.600
 in these other contexts.

2:20:50.600 --> 2:20:53.000

2:21:37.060 --> 2:21:38.200
 During today's podcast,

2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:39.620
 we didn't really talk about supplements,

2:21:39.620 --> 2:21:42.540
 but we do talk about supplements and their various uses

2:21:42.540 --> 2:21:45.500
 in many other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:21:45.500 --> 2:21:47.920
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:50.340
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

2:21:50.340 --> 2:21:53.840
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:56.480
 because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality

2:21:56.480 --> 2:21:57.880
 and stringency.

2:21:57.880 --> 2:22:00.140
 If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,

2:22:00.140 --> 2:22:04.120
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:06.740
 and there you can get 20% off any of the supplements

2:22:06.740 --> 2:22:07.580
 that I take.

2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:10.680
 And if you happen to navigate deeper into the Thorne site

2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:13.640
 through that portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

2:22:16.380 --> 2:22:17.480
 that Thorne makes.

2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:52.880
 We do not share your email with anybody else.

2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:55.800
 And we have a very clear privacy policy there

2:22:55.800 --> 2:22:58.320
 at that website if you choose to explore it.

2:22:58.320 --> 2:22:59.360
 I'm also pleased to announce

2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:01.240
 that we have some live events coming up.

2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:04.260
 So I will be giving a lecture called the Brain Body Contract

2:23:04.260 --> 2:23:06.420
 where I'll talk about science and science-based tools,

2:23:06.420 --> 2:23:08.080
 some of which overlap with the content

2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:09.200
 of the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:10.320
 Much of which is unique

2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:12.960
 and has never been presented publicly before.

2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:16.080
 The first one is going to be May 17th, 2022

2:23:16.080 --> 2:23:17.300
 in Seattle, Washington.

2:23:17.300 --> 2:23:21.460
 The second one is going to be May 18th in Portland, Oregon.

2:23:21.460 --> 2:23:23.520
 To access tickets, you can go to the link

2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:26.360
 at HubermanLab.com slash tour.

2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:28.440
 So thank you once again for joining me today

2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:31.640
 for this deep dive discussion into phototherapies,

2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:32.800
 meaning the power of light

2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:34.960
 to modulate our biology and health.

2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:39.960
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
