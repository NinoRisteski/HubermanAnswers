00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.200
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.200 --> 00:12.920
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.920 --> 00:15.160
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.400
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Matthew Walker

00:18.400 --> 00:21.180
 as our guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:21.180 --> 00:24.120
 Dr. Walker is a professor of neuroscience and psychology

00:24.120 --> 00:26.680
 at the University of California, Berkeley.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.480
 There, his laboratory studies sleep.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.800
 They study why we sleep, what occurs during sleep,

00:32.800 --> 00:36.840
 such as dreams and why we dream, learning during sleep,

00:36.840 --> 00:39.280
 as well as the consequences of getting insufficient

00:39.280 --> 00:43.160
 or poor quality sleep on waking states.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.760
 Dr. Walker is also the author

00:44.760 --> 00:48.320
 of the international bestselling book, Why We Sleep.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.320
 Our discussion today is an absolutely fascinating one

00:51.320 --> 00:54.240
 for anyone that's interested in sleep, learning,

00:54.240 --> 00:56.920
 or human performance of any kind.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.460
 Dr. Walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.820
 He also discusses naps,

01:01.820 --> 01:04.220
 whether or not we should or should not nap,

01:04.220 --> 01:06.800
 whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep,

01:06.800 --> 01:09.160
 and if so, how to best do that.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.000
 We discuss behavioral protocols and interactions

01:12.000 --> 01:15.520
 with light, temperature, supplementation, food,

01:15.520 --> 01:19.220
 exercise, sex, all the variables that can impact

01:19.220 --> 01:22.840
 this incredible state of mind and body that we call sleep.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.280
 During my scientific career,

01:24.280 --> 01:26.100
 I've read many papers about sleep

01:26.100 --> 01:28.620
 and attended many seminars about sleep.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.320
 Yet, my discussion with Dr. Walker today

01:31.320 --> 01:34.680
 revealed to me more about sleep, sleep science,

01:34.680 --> 01:36.580
 and how to get better at sleeping

01:36.580 --> 01:39.720
 than all of those papers and seminars combined.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.960
 I'm also delighted to share

01:40.960 --> 01:44.040
 that Dr. Walker has started a podcast.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.560
 That podcast, entitled The Matt Walker Podcast,

01:47.560 --> 01:49.880
 releases its first episode this month

01:49.880 --> 01:51.980
 and is going to teach all about sleep

01:51.980 --> 01:53.760
 and how to get better at sleeping.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.260
 So be sure to check out The Matt Walker Podcast

01:56.260 --> 01:59.740
 on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.

01:59.740 --> 02:02.220
 Before we begin, I'd like to mention that this podcast

02:02.220 --> 02:05.100
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.160
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:07.160 --> 02:09.260
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

02:09.260 --> 02:11.400
 about science and science-related tools

02:11.400 --> 02:13.080
 to the general public.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.280
 In keeping with that theme,

02:14.280 --> 02:17.180
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.360
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.360
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:21.360 --> 02:24.000
 that are of the absolutely highest quality.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.260
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

02:26.260 --> 02:28.400
 from Stanford, and everything about the design

02:28.400 --> 02:31.460
 of their glasses is with performance in mind.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.360
 I've spent my career studying the visual system

02:33.360 --> 02:36.040
 and how it works, and I can tell you that Roca glasses

02:36.040 --> 02:38.520
 take into account the science of the visual system,

02:38.520 --> 02:40.240
 such that whether or not you're wearing them

02:40.240 --> 02:43.500
 on a very bright day or you walk into a shadowed area

02:43.500 --> 02:44.760
 or there's cloud cover,

02:44.760 --> 02:47.560
 you can still see everything with perfect clarity.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.600
 That also reflects the fact that the lenses that they use

02:50.600 --> 02:53.280
 are of the absolute highest optical quality.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.560
 The other terrific thing about Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:56.560 --> 02:59.380
 is that they're designed to be worn in all conditions.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.840
 You can use them while running, while cycling.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.660
 Even if you get sweaty, they won't slip off,

03:04.660 --> 03:06.360
 and they look great.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.400
 One problem I have with a lot of so-called

03:08.400 --> 03:10.820
 performance eyeglasses and sunglasses out there

03:10.820 --> 03:12.000
 is that they look crazy.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.960
 They make people look like cyborgs.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.880
 Roca glasses have a terrific aesthetic.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.760
 You can wear them to dinner, you can wear them at work,

03:17.760 --> 03:20.780
 and you can wear them in all sorts of sports activities.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.280
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

03:22.280 --> 03:25.280
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

03:25.280 --> 03:29.120

03:29.120 --> 03:31.280
 That's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,

03:31.280 --> 03:33.760
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

03:33.760 --> 03:37.120
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.760
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

03:39.760 --> 03:42.560
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

03:42.560 --> 03:44.320
 to help you better understand your body

03:44.320 --> 03:46.200
 and reach your health goals.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.780
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

03:48.780 --> 03:51.580
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

03:51.580 --> 03:54.020
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

03:54.020 --> 03:56.780
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

03:56.780 --> 03:59.540
 And nowadays, with the advent of DNA tests,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.860
 you can also get insight into your immediate

04:01.860 --> 04:05.960
 and long-term health by way of understanding your DNA.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.600
 One issue with many DNA and blood tests, however,

04:08.600 --> 04:11.580
 is that you get the numbers back about metabolic factors,

04:11.580 --> 04:13.340
 hormones, genes, et cetera,

04:13.340 --> 04:15.040
 but there's no directive as to what to do

04:15.040 --> 04:16.480
 with that information.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.840
 With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy-to-use dashboard,

04:19.840 --> 04:22.460
 and that dashboard not only gives you your numbers,

04:22.460 --> 04:24.760
 but it gives you simple directives

04:24.760 --> 04:27.640
 related to nutrition, supplementation, exercise,

04:27.640 --> 04:29.160
 and other lifestyle factors

04:29.160 --> 04:30.680
 that allow you to move those numbers

04:30.680 --> 04:32.440
 into the ranges that are right for you

04:32.440 --> 04:34.020
 and your health goals.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.520
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:35.520 --> 04:38.680
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

04:38.680 --> 04:39.800
 and if you do that,

04:39.800 --> 04:42.740
 you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.440
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.680
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.280
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

04:51.280 --> 04:52.960
 that raises organic, grass-fed,

04:52.960 --> 04:55.700
 and finished certified humane meats.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.040
 I don't eat a lot of meat.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.760
 I eat meat about once a day,

04:58.760 --> 05:01.000
 but when I do, I make sure that it's high quality

05:01.000 --> 05:03.760
 and both humanely and sustainably raised.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.240
 Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots

05:06.240 --> 05:08.500
 and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

05:08.500 --> 05:10.920
 but Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

05:10.920 --> 05:12.860
 and seasonal grasses, resulting in meat

05:12.860 --> 05:15.240
 that's higher in nutrients and healthy fats.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.340
 And I've talked many times before on this podcast

05:17.340 --> 05:20.720
 about how getting sufficient levels of omega-3s

05:20.720 --> 05:23.560
 is very important for metabolic health, hormone health,

05:23.560 --> 05:26.640
 mood, essentially all aspects of one's health.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.240
 Belcampo meats have high levels of omega-3s

05:29.240 --> 05:31.580
 because of the grasses they feed on.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.440
 The way Belcampo raises its animals

05:33.440 --> 05:35.000
 isn't just better for our health.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.680
 It also has a positive impact on the environment.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.720
 They practice regenerative agriculture,

05:39.720 --> 05:41.920
 which means that their meat is climate positive

05:41.920 --> 05:44.200
 and carbon negative, meaning it's good for you

05:44.200 --> 05:46.380
 and it's good for the environment.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.680
 You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats

05:48.680 --> 05:51.400
 to be delivered to you using my code Huberman

05:51.400 --> 05:54.320
 by going to belcampo.com slash Huberman.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.720
 And if you do that, you'll get 20% off your first order.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.520
 I'm a big fan of their keto meatballs.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.400
 I also really like their boneless ribeyes.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.680
 I eat those pretty much once a day.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.000
 Again, that's Huberman for the code

06:06.000 --> 06:10.760
 and it's belcampo.com slash Huberman for 20% off your order.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.860
 And now my discussion with Dr. Matt Walker.

06:13.860 --> 06:15.320
 Great to finally meet you in person.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.360
 Wonderful to connect.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.900
 I mean, it's been too long,

06:18.900 --> 06:21.260
 but I suspect it would have been a shorter time

06:21.260 --> 06:23.760
 before we'd met, lest the pandemic.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.720
 Yeah.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.540
 Thank you.

06:25.540 --> 06:26.380
 No, thank you.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.920
 Yeah, I'm delighted that we're finally

06:27.920 --> 06:28.980
 sitting down face to face.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.540
 I've been tracking your work, both in the internet sphere,

06:32.540 --> 06:34.680
 and I read your book and loved it.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.840
 And also from the perspective of science,

06:36.840 --> 06:39.360
 you actually came to Stanford a couple of years ago

06:39.360 --> 06:43.560
 and gave a lecture for brain mind.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.240
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.600
 And there, of course, you talked about sleep

06:48.600 --> 06:50.600
 and its utility and its challenges

06:50.600 --> 06:54.800
 and how to conquer it, so to speak.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.820
 Let's start off very basic.

06:56.820 --> 06:57.920
 What is sleep?

06:59.360 --> 07:03.040
 Sleep is probably the single most effective thing

07:03.040 --> 07:05.440
 you can do to reset your brain and body health.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.440
 So that's a functional answer in terms of,

07:08.440 --> 07:11.920
 you know, what is sleep in terms of its benefits.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.840
 Sleep as a process, though,

07:13.840 --> 07:18.680
 is an incredibly complex physiological ballet.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.760
 And if you were to recognize or see what happens

07:21.760 --> 07:24.800
 to your brain and your body at night during sleep,

07:24.800 --> 07:26.920
 you would be blown away.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.720
 And the paradox is that most of us,

07:28.720 --> 07:30.720
 and I would think this too, you know,

07:30.720 --> 07:32.400
 if I wasn't a sleep scientist,

07:32.400 --> 07:37.360
 we go to bed, we lose consciousness for seven to nine hours,

07:37.360 --> 07:39.200
 and then we sort of wake up in the morning

07:39.200 --> 07:41.560
 and we generally feel better.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.960
 And in some ways that denies the physiological

07:44.960 --> 07:48.200
 and biological beauty of sleep.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.900
 So upstairs in your brain,

07:49.900 --> 07:52.400
 when you're going through these different stages of sleep,

07:52.400 --> 07:56.900
 the changes in brainwave activity are far more dramatic

07:56.900 --> 07:59.160
 than those that we see when we're awake.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.920
 And we can speak about deep sleep and what happens there.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
 REM sleep is a fascinating time,

08:03.920 --> 08:07.260
 which is another stage of sleep often called dream sleep,

08:07.260 --> 08:09.480
 which is rapid eye movement sleep.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.600
 That stage of sleep, some parts of your brain

08:11.600 --> 08:15.600
 are up to 30% more active than when you're awake.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.240
 So again, it's kind of violating this idea

08:18.240 --> 08:20.540
 that our mind is dormant

08:20.540 --> 08:24.460
 and our body is just simply quiescent and resting.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.800
 So I would happy to just sort of double click

08:26.800 --> 08:27.920
 on either one of those

08:27.920 --> 08:30.600
 and also what changes in the body as well.

08:30.600 --> 08:35.560
 But it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit

08:35.560 --> 08:37.160
 and system.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.200
 That said though,

08:38.200 --> 08:43.200
 I would almost push back against an evolved system

08:43.600 --> 08:45.880
 when we think about the question of sleep

08:45.880 --> 08:47.420
 and what sleep is.

08:47.420 --> 08:52.320
 Our assumption has always been that we evolved to sleep.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.680
 And I've actually questioned that

08:53.680 --> 08:56.600
 and I have no way to get in a time capsule

08:56.600 --> 08:57.820
 and go back and prove this.

08:57.820 --> 09:02.360
 But what if we started off sleeping

09:02.360 --> 09:05.760
 and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged?

09:05.760 --> 09:09.040
 Why do we assume that it's the other way around?

09:09.040 --> 09:12.580
 And I think there's probably some really good evidence

09:12.580 --> 09:15.980
 that sleep may have been the proto state,

09:15.980 --> 09:20.120
 that it was the basic fundamental living state.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.480
 And when we became awake, as it were,

09:23.480 --> 09:26.800
 we always had to return to sleep.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.320
 In some ways at that point,

09:28.320 --> 09:31.900
 sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness.

09:31.900 --> 09:35.080
 And that's another way of describing what sleep is.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.320
 But again, I think it sort of denies

09:37.320 --> 09:39.400
 that the active state of sleep,

09:39.400 --> 09:41.780
 it's not a passive state of sleep either.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
 And then finally you can say,

09:43.800 --> 09:47.140
 what is sleep across different species?

09:47.140 --> 09:50.520
 And in us human beings and in all mammalian species

09:50.520 --> 09:52.220
 and avian species as well,

09:52.220 --> 09:55.560
 sleep is broadly separated into these two main types.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.400
 And we've got non-rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand,

09:58.400 --> 10:01.540
 and then we've got rapid eye movement sleep on the other.

10:01.540 --> 10:04.840
 And we can speak about how they unfold across a night

10:04.840 --> 10:05.960
 and their architecture,

10:05.960 --> 10:09.000
 because it's not just intellectually interesting

10:09.000 --> 10:11.580
 from the perspective of what sleep is.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.200
 It's also practically impactful for our daily lives.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.080
 And I'd love to sort of go down that route too,

10:17.080 --> 10:19.120
 but you navigate, you tell me I can-

10:19.120 --> 10:20.600
 Let's definitely go down that route.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.280
 So you mentioned how active the brain is

10:23.280 --> 10:25.480
 during certain phases of sleep.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.140
 When I was coming up in science,

10:28.140 --> 10:29.760
 REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,

10:29.760 --> 10:32.160
 was referred to as paradoxical sleep.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.240
 Is that still a good way to think about it?

10:34.240 --> 10:36.160
 Paradoxical because the brain is so active

10:36.160 --> 10:38.780
 and yet we are essentially paralyzed, correct?

10:38.780 --> 10:40.480
 Yeah, it really is a paradox.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.540
 And where that came from

10:42.540 --> 10:45.100
 was simply the brainwave recordings.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.440
 That if all I'm measuring about you

10:47.440 --> 10:50.080
 is your brainwave activity,

10:50.080 --> 10:51.960
 it's very difficult for me

10:51.960 --> 10:54.700
 sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room

10:54.700 --> 10:58.480
 to figure out, are you awake or are you in REM sleep?

10:58.480 --> 11:00.640
 Because those two patterns of brain activity

11:00.640 --> 11:02.860
 are so close to one another,

11:02.860 --> 11:05.480
 you can't discriminate between them.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.160
 Yet the paradox is that when you are awake,

11:08.160 --> 11:10.600
 I go in there and you're sort of sitting up,

11:10.600 --> 11:12.740
 you're clearly conscious and awake.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.240
 But yet when you go into REM sleep,

11:15.240 --> 11:18.640
 you are completely paralyzed.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.080
 And that's one of the,

11:21.080 --> 11:23.200
 I think that's part of the paradox,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.000
 but the paradox really just comes down

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
 to two dramatically different conscious states.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.360
 Yet brain activity is dramatically

11:32.360 --> 11:34.200
 more similar than different.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.920
 And the way I can figure out which of the two you are in

11:37.920 --> 11:40.040
 is by measuring two other signals,

11:40.040 --> 11:41.860
 the activity from your eyes

11:41.860 --> 11:44.420
 and the activity from your muscles.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.040
 So when we're awake,

11:46.040 --> 11:47.660
 we will occasionally have these blinks

11:47.660 --> 11:49.640
 and we'll have sort of saccades.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.740
 But during REM sleep,

11:50.740 --> 11:53.300
 you have these really bizarre horizontal

11:53.300 --> 11:55.760
 shuttling eye movements that occur.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.800
 And that's where the name comes from, rapid eye movements.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.400
 Are they always horizontal?

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
 Mostly they are horizontal.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.940
 And that's one of the ways that we can differentiate them

12:04.940 --> 12:07.900
 from other waking eye movement activity.

12:07.900 --> 12:10.840
 Because it's not always, it can be sometimes horizontal,

12:10.840 --> 12:14.940
 but can also have diagonal and also vertical in that plane.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.460
 But then the muscle activity is the real dead giveaway.

12:19.460 --> 12:22.520
 Just before you enter REM sleep,

12:22.520 --> 12:26.240
 your brainstem, which is where the dynamics of non-REM

12:26.240 --> 12:28.320
 and REM are essentially played out

12:28.320 --> 12:30.960
 and then expressed upstairs in the cortex

12:30.960 --> 12:33.160
 and downstairs in the body.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.400
 When we go into REM sleep

12:34.400 --> 12:37.520
 and just a few seconds before that happens,

12:37.520 --> 12:39.960
 the brainstem sends a signal

12:39.960 --> 12:41.960
 all the way down the spinal cord.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.720
 And it communicates with what are called

12:43.720 --> 12:45.960
 the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord,

12:45.960 --> 12:48.960
 which control of voluntary skeletal muscles.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.600
 And it's a signal of paralysis.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.520
 And when you go into dream sleep,

12:53.520 --> 12:57.480
 you are locked into a physical incarceration

12:57.480 --> 12:59.400
 of your own body.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.240
 Amazing.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.300
 You know, why would mother nature do such a thing?

13:04.300 --> 13:07.260
 And it's in some ways very simple.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.560
 The brain paralyzes the body

13:09.560 --> 13:12.160
 so that the mind can dream safely.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.780
 Because think about how quickly

13:13.780 --> 13:15.920
 we would have all been popped out of the gene pool.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.440
 You know, if I think I'm one of the best skydivers

13:19.440 --> 13:21.620
 who can just simply fly,

13:21.620 --> 13:24.160
 and I've had sometimes those dreams too,

13:24.160 --> 13:28.000
 and I get up on my apartment window and I leap out.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.820
 You're done.

13:28.820 --> 13:29.960
 You're done.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.480
 So that's one of the sort of,

13:31.480 --> 13:34.080
 that's part of the paradox of REM sleep,

13:34.080 --> 13:36.280
 both its brain activity similarity,

13:36.280 --> 13:38.780
 despite the behavioral state being so different,

13:38.780 --> 13:43.720
 and this bizarre lockdown of the sort of brain

13:43.720 --> 13:45.080
 of the body itself.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.400
 Now, of course, the involuntary muscles,

13:47.400 --> 13:49.840
 thankfully, aren't paralyzed.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.440
 So you keep breathing, your heart keeps beating.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.620
 Is this why men have erections during REM sleep

13:55.620 --> 13:58.200
 and women have vaginal lubrication during sleep?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.400
 That's one of the reasons.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.680
 Part of the other reason, though,

14:00.680 --> 14:03.440
 that is because of the autonomic activity.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.280
 So there is a part of our nervous system

14:06.280 --> 14:08.080
 called the autonomic nervous system,

14:08.080 --> 14:11.660
 and it controls many of the automatic behaviors.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.660
 And some of those are aspects of our reproductive facilities.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.780
 During REM sleep, what we later discovered

14:20.780 --> 14:23.120
 is that you go through these bizarre,

14:23.120 --> 14:26.520
 what we call autonomic storms, which sounds dramatic,

14:26.520 --> 14:28.960
 but it actually is when you measure them,

14:28.960 --> 14:30.320
 that you'll go through periods

14:30.320 --> 14:33.240
 where your heart rate decelerates and drops

14:33.240 --> 14:35.120
 and your blood pressure goes down,

14:35.120 --> 14:37.040
 and then utterly randomly,

14:37.040 --> 14:39.700
 your heart rate accelerates dramatically

14:39.700 --> 14:41.760
 and what we call the fight or flight branch

14:41.760 --> 14:43.020
 of the autonomic nervous system

14:43.020 --> 14:44.880
 or the sympathetic nervous system,

14:44.880 --> 14:47.140
 a badly named because it's anything but sympathetic,

14:47.140 --> 14:48.340
 it's very aggravating,

14:49.360 --> 14:53.080
 that all of a sudden fires up and then it shuts down again.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.320
 And it's not in any regular way.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.520
 And it's when you get those autonomic storms,

14:57.520 --> 15:01.020
 you get very activated from a physiological perspective,

15:01.020 --> 15:02.640
 that you can have these erections

15:02.640 --> 15:04.600
 and you have vaginal discharge, et cetera.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.920
 But you're totally paralyzed.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.740
 But you are still paralyzed.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.740
 There are only two voluntary muscle groups

15:14.840 --> 15:18.280
 that are spurred from the paralysis, bizarre.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.620
 One, your extra ocular muscles,

15:20.620 --> 15:22.780
 because if they were paralyzed,

15:22.780 --> 15:25.720
 you wouldn't be able to have rapid eye movements.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.700
 And the other that we later discovered

15:27.700 --> 15:30.120
 was the inner ear muscle.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.200
 And we've got no good understanding

15:33.200 --> 15:35.400
 as to why those two muscle groups

15:35.400 --> 15:37.160
 are spurred from the paralysis.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.760
 It may have something to do with cranial nerve,

15:39.760 --> 15:42.040
 but I don't think it's that.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.200
 I think it's perhaps something more sensory related.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.640
 Some people have argued that the reason the eyeballs

15:47.640 --> 15:49.480
 are spurred from the paralysis

15:49.480 --> 15:51.200
 is because if your eyeballs are left

15:51.200 --> 15:53.540
 for long periods of time inactive,

15:53.540 --> 15:56.840
 you may get things such as oxygen sort of issues

15:56.840 --> 16:00.000
 in the aqueous or vitreous humor.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.440
 And so the eyeballs have to keep moving in some way.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.680
 The drainage systems of the anterior eye

16:04.680 --> 16:06.520
 are made to require movement.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.040
 People with glaucoma have deficits in drainage

16:10.040 --> 16:12.560
 through the anterior chamber, but there I'm speculating.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.720
 I'm also speculating when I asked this.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.520
 I would imagine that there are states in waking

16:20.520 --> 16:22.480
 that also resemble slow wave sleep,

16:22.480 --> 16:25.100
 or rather that there are states that slow wave sleep

16:25.100 --> 16:27.020
 also resembles waking states.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.080
 You've beautifully illustrated how REM sleep

16:30.080 --> 16:32.240
 can mimic some of the more active brain states

16:32.240 --> 16:34.200
 that we achieve in waking.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.960
 What sort of waking state that I might've experienced

16:36.960 --> 16:40.520
 or experienced on a daily basis might look similar

16:40.520 --> 16:43.640
 to slow wave sleep, non-REM sleep, if any?

16:43.640 --> 16:45.720
 It's a genius way of thinking about it.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.960
 Turns the tables, I love it.

16:47.960 --> 16:52.960
 We almost never see anything like the true ultra slow waves

16:53.960 --> 16:55.520
 of deep non-REM sleep.

16:55.520 --> 16:59.200
 So we spoke about these two stages, non-REM and REM.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.000
 Non-REM is further subdivided into four separate stages,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.580
 stages one through four, increasing in the depth of sleep.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.960
 So stages three and four,

17:07.960 --> 17:10.420
 that's what we typically call deep non-REM sleep,

17:10.420 --> 17:11.520
 stages one and two.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.160
 So maybe take me through the arc of a night,

17:13.160 --> 17:16.560
 just so that, so I put my head down.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.680
 Well, for you, what time do you normally go to sleep?

17:18.680 --> 17:23.520
 So I'm usually sort of around about a 10.30 PM guy,

17:23.520 --> 17:26.040
 and usually I'll naturally wake up

17:26.040 --> 17:27.840
 sort of a little bit before seven,

17:27.840 --> 17:30.000
 sometimes before 6.45 or seven.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.040
 I have an alarm set for 7.04 AM.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
 You heard it here, folks.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.520
 Matt Walker does use an alarm clock.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.240
 I really, really, I'm usually-

17:39.240 --> 17:40.960
 He doesn't recommend it, but he does use it.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.800
 Yeah, I usually-

17:41.800 --> 17:42.840
 You're human after all.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.960
 Oh, I am so human.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.620
 And I've had my sleep issues

17:46.620 --> 17:47.960
 and I'd love to speak about that too,

17:47.960 --> 17:52.200
 but it's only just in the event that,

17:53.080 --> 17:54.780
 cause I like to keep regularity too,

17:54.780 --> 17:56.920
 you've got to keep those two things in balance.

17:56.920 --> 18:01.240
 And 7.04, just because, you know, why not be idiosyncratic?

18:01.240 --> 18:05.000
 I don't know why we always set things on these hard numbers.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.840
 So, yep, so when-

18:06.840 --> 18:08.760
 So you go to sleep around 10.30,

18:08.760 --> 18:11.120
 so using you as an example,

18:11.120 --> 18:12.640
 because I imagine a number of people go to sleep

18:12.640 --> 18:13.960
 at different times, but 10.30 is about

18:13.960 --> 18:15.540
 when I go sleep, 11 is for me,

18:15.540 --> 18:17.840
 but so you go to sleep at 10.30.

18:17.840 --> 18:22.000
 So for that first, let's say three hours of sleep,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.400
 what is the architecture of that sleep look like

18:24.400 --> 18:27.320
 as compared to the last three hours of your sleep

18:27.320 --> 18:28.160
 before morning?

18:28.160 --> 18:30.480
 Yeah, so I should note that that sort of,

18:30.480 --> 18:32.320
 you know, 10.30 to seven,

18:32.320 --> 18:36.100
 that's just based on my chronotype and my preferential.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.480
 It's different for different people.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.040
 I'm not suggesting that that's the perfect sweet spot

18:40.040 --> 18:41.560
 for humanity's sleep.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.400
 It's just my-

18:42.400 --> 18:45.440
 But I imagine most people probably go to sleep

18:45.440 --> 18:50.000
 somewhere between 10 and PM and midnight.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.320
 And most probably wake up between 5 AM and 7 AM

18:53.320 --> 18:55.180
 or 5.30 and 7.30.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.520
 Yeah, yeah, at least in,

18:57.520 --> 18:59.340
 if you look at sort of first world nations,

18:59.340 --> 19:01.760
 that's a typical sleep profile.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.120
 So when I first fall asleep,

19:05.120 --> 19:07.920
 I'll go into the light stages of non-REM sleep,

19:07.920 --> 19:10.240
 stages one and two of non-REM,

19:10.240 --> 19:12.100
 and then I'll start to descend down

19:12.100 --> 19:14.600
 into the deeper stages of non-REM sleep.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.400
 So after about maybe 20 minutes,

19:16.400 --> 19:19.600
 I'm starting to head down into stage three non-REM

19:19.600 --> 19:22.820
 and then into stage four non-REM sleep.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.800
 And as I'm starting to fall asleep,

19:24.800 --> 19:28.080
 as I've cast off from the usually with me

19:28.080 --> 19:30.000
 murky waters of wakefulness,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.080
 and I'm in the shallows of sleep stages one and two,

19:33.080 --> 19:35.780
 my heart rate starts to drop a little bit,

19:35.780 --> 19:39.960
 and then my brainwave pattern activity starts to slow down.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.280
 Normally when I'm awake,

19:41.280 --> 19:44.440
 it's going up and down maybe 20, 30, 40,

19:44.440 --> 19:46.180
 50 times a second.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.920
 As I'm going into light non-REM sleep,

19:49.920 --> 19:53.140
 it will slow down to maybe 15, 20,

19:53.140 --> 19:54.820
 and then really starts to slow down,

19:54.820 --> 19:58.200
 down to about sort of 10 or eight cycles per second,

19:58.200 --> 20:00.100
 eight cycle waves per second.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.340
 Then as I'm starting to move into

20:04.340 --> 20:06.680
 stages three and four non-REM sleep,

20:06.680 --> 20:08.780
 several remarkable things happen.

20:08.780 --> 20:12.400
 All of a sudden, my heart rate really does start to drop.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.280
 Oh, and I'll come back to temperature.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.560
 I'm going to write temperature down

20:16.560 --> 20:18.780
 because I always forget these things.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.800
 Now I'm solidly in the foothills of middle age.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.800
 So as I'm starting to go into those deeper stages

20:24.800 --> 20:27.120
 of non-REM sleep, all of a sudden,

20:27.120 --> 20:30.560
 hundreds of thousands of cells in my cortex

20:30.560 --> 20:33.840
 all decide to fire together,

20:33.840 --> 20:36.080
 and then they all go silent together.

20:36.080 --> 20:40.360
 And it's this remarkable physiological coordination

20:40.360 --> 20:43.240
 of the likes that we just don't see

20:43.240 --> 20:45.200
 during any other brain state.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.020
 That's really interesting.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.160
 Having recorded from the brains of animals

20:48.160 --> 20:49.440
 and a little bit from humans,

20:49.440 --> 20:51.400
 I don't think I've ever seen the entire cortex

20:51.400 --> 20:54.240
 or even entire regions of cortex light up like that.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.160
 Yeah, it's stunning.

20:56.160 --> 21:00.440
 It's almost like this beautiful sort of mantra chant,

21:00.440 --> 21:03.460
 or this sort of, you know, it's a slow inhale,

21:03.460 --> 21:07.000
 and then a meditative exhale, inhale, exhale.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.240
 And these waves are just enormous in their size.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.360
 And the body is capable of movement at this time.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.240
 There is no paralysis.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.560
 There is no paralysis, but for the most part,

21:16.560 --> 21:19.720
 muscle tone has also dropped significantly

21:19.720 --> 21:21.180
 at that point.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.760
 And then you will, or I will then stay there

21:23.760 --> 21:26.160
 for about another 20 or 30 minutes.

21:26.160 --> 21:31.160
 So now I'm maybe 60 or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.440
 And then I'll start to rise back up,

21:33.440 --> 21:36.080
 back up into stage two non-REM sleep.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.520
 And then after about 80 or so minutes,

21:38.520 --> 21:41.640
 I'll pop up and I'll have a short REM sleep period.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.540
 And then back down I go again,

21:43.540 --> 21:46.160
 down into non-REM, up into REM.

21:46.160 --> 21:49.080
 And you do that reliably, repeatedly,

21:49.080 --> 21:51.480
 and I will be doing that, and I do do that,

21:51.480 --> 21:53.160
 every 90 minutes.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.880
 At least that's the average for most adults.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.160
 It's different in different species.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.320
 What changes to your question is the ratio

22:02.320 --> 22:05.460
 of non-REM to REM within that 90 minute cycle

22:05.460 --> 22:07.540
 as you move across the night.

22:07.540 --> 22:10.540
 And what I mean by this is in the first half of the night,

22:10.540 --> 22:13.180
 the majority of those 90 minute cycles

22:13.180 --> 22:15.840
 are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.200
 That's when I get my stage three and four

22:18.200 --> 22:19.960
 of deep non-REM sleep.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.860
 Once I push through to the second half of the night,

22:22.860 --> 22:25.500
 now that seesaw balance changes,

22:25.500 --> 22:28.680
 and instead the majority of those 90 minute cycles

22:28.680 --> 22:31.160
 are comprised either of this lighter form

22:31.160 --> 22:33.720
 of non-REM sleep, stage two non-REM sleep,

22:33.720 --> 22:36.440
 and much more, and increasingly more,

22:36.440 --> 22:37.940
 rapid eye movement sleep.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.200
 And the implication that I was sort of speaking about

22:41.200 --> 22:45.280
 pragmatically is let's say that

22:45.280 --> 22:47.480
 I have to and I usually never do

22:47.480 --> 22:49.600
 early morning flights or red eyes

22:49.600 --> 22:51.760
 just because I'm a mess if that happens.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.520
 I'm not suggesting that other people shouldn't.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.160
 I'm suggesting people not do that.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.420
 Every time I've taken a red eye or I've done that,

22:57.420 --> 22:58.480
 two or three days later,

22:58.480 --> 23:01.200
 I get some sort of general feeling of malaise.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.800
 My brain doesn't work as well.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.520
 I think red eyes should be abolished.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.280
 For the pilots too, I mean, and for the-

23:07.280 --> 23:08.840
 Oh, and we can speak about those.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.520
 And for the emergency room, I mean,

23:10.520 --> 23:12.880
 long shifts have been shown to lead to

23:12.880 --> 23:17.120
 physician-induced errors that lead to a lot of fatalities.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.660
 I mean, there are a lot of reasons why

23:18.660 --> 23:20.780
 staying up too long or being up at the wrong times

23:20.780 --> 23:23.320
 if you're not adapted to it is just terrible.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.320
 The data in all of those cases,

23:25.320 --> 23:26.780
 and particularly physicians too,

23:26.780 --> 23:29.880
 there was some recent data looking at suicidality.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.640
 And the rates of suicide in training physicians

23:32.640 --> 23:35.440
 are far, far above the norm.

23:35.440 --> 23:40.160
 And I don't suspect that their schedules are helping them.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.480
 I suspect that sleep is a missing part

23:43.480 --> 23:45.640
 of that explanatory equation, but-

23:45.640 --> 23:48.600
 I teach medical students and they're phenomenal,

23:48.600 --> 23:51.720
 but yeah, they're under extremely challenged conditions.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.560
 It's-

23:52.560 --> 23:53.400
 We shouldn't put them under those conditions.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.040
 No, it's not optimizing performance.

23:56.040 --> 23:56.880
 I have one-

23:56.880 --> 23:57.720
 But sorry, I was-

23:57.720 --> 23:59.520
 No, no, no, this is important.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.840
 It's an important digression.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.100
 I have one question,

24:02.100 --> 24:04.660
 which is you're saying that as across the night,

24:04.660 --> 24:06.700
 a greater percentage of these 90-minute cycles

24:06.700 --> 24:08.560
 are going to be occupied by REM sleep

24:08.560 --> 24:10.620
 as you progress through the night.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.760
 I'm aware that based on work that you've done

24:15.760 --> 24:19.300
 and from your public education efforts and others,

24:20.200 --> 24:25.040
 that we have so-called circadian forces

24:25.040 --> 24:28.240
 and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep

24:28.240 --> 24:29.440
 and when we want to sleep, et cetera,

24:29.440 --> 24:31.200
 without going into the details of those.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.140
 I have a simple question.

24:32.140 --> 24:33.520
 The experiment is the following.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.480
 Let's say, God forbid,

24:35.480 --> 24:38.920
 you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time

24:38.920 --> 24:42.920
 and you stay up for the four hours or five hours

24:42.920 --> 24:44.060
 that normally you would be

24:44.060 --> 24:45.840
 in predominantly slow-wave sleep.

24:45.840 --> 24:46.680
 Yep.

24:46.680 --> 24:51.200
 If, let's say, you finally get to lie down at 3 a.m.,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.800
 a time when normally your sleep would be occupied

24:53.800 --> 24:56.160
 mostly by rapid eye movement sleep,

24:57.440 --> 25:00.500
 will you experience a greater percentage

25:00.500 --> 25:01.800
 of rapid eye movement sleep

25:01.800 --> 25:04.600
 because of these so-called circadian forces,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.760
 meaning that's what's appropriate for that time,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.040
 or will your system need to start

25:09.040 --> 25:11.600
 at the beginning of the race that we're,

25:11.600 --> 25:14.400
 as I'm referring to it, that we're calling sleep?

25:14.400 --> 25:15.240
 Yep.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.200
 If that's not clear to anybody,

25:16.200 --> 25:18.240
 basically what I'm asking is if you are forced

25:18.240 --> 25:20.600
 to skip the slow-wave sleep part of the night,

25:20.600 --> 25:24.720
 will your system leap into rapid eye movement sleep

25:24.720 --> 25:26.400
 or does it have to start at the beginning

25:26.400 --> 25:27.820
 and get slow-wave sleep first?

25:27.820 --> 25:29.840
 In other words, does one sleep state

25:29.840 --> 25:32.440
 drive the entry to the next sleep state?

25:32.440 --> 25:33.360
 Great question.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.600
 So there is some degree of reciprocity

25:35.600 --> 25:37.740
 between the sleep states, I should note,

25:37.740 --> 25:40.420
 that when we drive one of those up,

25:40.420 --> 25:44.880
 we often, but not always, see a change in the other.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.580
 There are some pharmacologies

25:46.580 --> 25:49.280
 that have shown an independence to that,

25:49.280 --> 25:51.600
 and we've also played around with things like temperature,

25:51.600 --> 25:55.020
 and sometimes you can nudge one

25:55.020 --> 25:58.680
 and not seem to upset or perturb the other.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.480
 But to your, I think, lovely point,

26:02.480 --> 26:06.560
 the answer is it's a mix, but it's mostly the latter,

26:06.560 --> 26:11.560
 meaning you will mostly go into your REM sleep phases

26:11.660 --> 26:15.920
 and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.640
 So just because I start my sleep cycle at 3 a.m.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.800
 rather than at 10.30 p.m.,

26:22.800 --> 26:24.380
 it doesn't mean that my brain just says,

26:24.380 --> 26:25.720
 well, I've got a program

26:25.720 --> 26:27.140
 and I'm just going to run the program,

26:27.140 --> 26:29.680
 and the way the program runs is that we always start

26:29.680 --> 26:32.800
 with a first couple of hours of deep sleep.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.640
 So we're just gonna begin act number one, scene one.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.880
 It doesn't do that.

26:37.880 --> 26:41.640
 Now, I will get some deep sleep to begin with,

26:41.640 --> 26:45.120
 and part of that is just because of how sleep works

26:45.120 --> 26:47.440
 based on how long I've been awake.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.520
 Longer I'm awake,

26:48.520 --> 26:51.880
 there is a significantly greater pressure for deep sleep.

26:51.880 --> 26:55.960
 But we actually use exactly what you just described

26:55.960 --> 26:57.680
 as an experimental technique

26:57.680 --> 26:59.980
 to selectively deprive people

26:59.980 --> 27:02.520
 of one of those stages of sleep or the other.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.040
 So we will do first half of the night deprivation

27:06.040 --> 27:08.200
 and then let you sleep the second half.

27:08.200 --> 27:12.120
 So that means that you will be mostly deep sleep deprived

27:12.120 --> 27:14.860
 and you will still get mostly all of your REM sleep.

27:15.760 --> 27:19.600
 And then we switch it so you only get your first four hours,

27:19.600 --> 27:22.280
 which means you will mostly get deep non-REM sleep,

27:22.280 --> 27:24.540
 but you will get almost no REM sleep.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.100
 So in both of those groups,

27:26.100 --> 27:28.100
 they've both had four hours of sleep.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.400
 So the difference between them

27:29.400 --> 27:33.240
 in terms of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time

27:33.240 --> 27:35.740
 because they've both slept for the same amount.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.340
 It's the contribution of those different stages.

27:38.340 --> 27:40.780
 Now, we actually have more elegant methods

27:40.780 --> 27:42.780
 for sort of selectively going in there

27:42.780 --> 27:45.440
 and scooping out different stages of sleep.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.460
 But that's the way we used to do it old school

27:47.460 --> 27:49.720
 was just using this timing difference.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.980
 And who suffers more, those that lack the early phase

27:52.980 --> 27:55.960
 and were those that lack the later phase of the night sleep?

27:55.960 --> 27:59.800
 In other words, if I have to sleep only four hours

27:59.800 --> 28:01.280
 for whatever reason, am I better off

28:01.280 --> 28:03.000
 getting the early part of the night sleep

28:03.000 --> 28:05.440
 or the second half of the night sleep?

28:05.440 --> 28:08.120
 Depends on what the outcome measure is.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.800
 So that gets right to the differences

28:09.800 --> 28:12.120
 between slow wave sleep and REM.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.840
 I was probably misinformed, but my understanding,

28:15.840 --> 28:18.600
 a very crude understanding, I should say before-

28:18.600 --> 28:21.480
 I very much doubt it, au contraire with someone like you.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.740
 Which is very nice of you.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.600
 But the first part of the night,

28:24.600 --> 28:27.400
 this slow wave sleep is restorative to the musculature,

28:27.400 --> 28:29.920
 to motor learning, and that the dream content

28:29.920 --> 28:31.440
 tends to be less emotional.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.960
 The second half of the night being more emotional dreams

28:33.960 --> 28:36.840
 and sort of the unpairing of the emotional load

28:36.840 --> 28:39.960
 of our previous day and other experiences.

28:39.960 --> 28:43.760
 So in other words, if I were to deprive myself of REM,

28:43.760 --> 28:46.800
 I would be hyper emotional, maybe not as settled

28:46.800 --> 28:49.040
 with the kind of experiences of my life.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.760
 Whereas if I had to deprive myself of slow wave sleep,

28:51.760 --> 28:54.280
 I would feel a more physical malaise.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.320
 Is that correct or is that far too simple?

28:56.320 --> 28:59.680
 And if it is too simple, please tell me where I'm wrong.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.020
 No, I think much of that is correct.

29:02.020 --> 29:04.660
 And it's sort of that plus.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.880
 So for example, during deep non-REM sleep,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.800
 that's where we get this, it's almost a form

29:09.800 --> 29:12.140
 of natural blood pressure medication.

29:12.140 --> 29:15.080
 And so when I take that away from you, the next day,

29:15.080 --> 29:17.680
 we're usually going to see autonomic dysfunction.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.440
 We're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate,

29:20.440 --> 29:21.640
 blood pressure.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.020
 We also know that during deep non-REM sleep

29:24.020 --> 29:26.960
 that there is a certain control of specific hormones.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.800
 For example, we know that the insulin regulation

29:29.800 --> 29:34.140
 of sort of metabolism, meaning how will you look

29:34.140 --> 29:37.200
 from a regulated blood sugar perspective

29:37.200 --> 29:42.200
 versus dysregulated pre-diabetic look of profile,

29:42.420 --> 29:44.440
 that's where deep sleep seems to matter.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.920
 If we selectively deprive you of that, we can see them.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.600
 Growth hormone is different actually.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.480
 So that's a beautiful demonstration

29:51.480 --> 29:55.120
 where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.120
 And that's why we can come on to the effects of alcohol.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.880
 And there was some really impressive frightening data

30:00.880 --> 30:04.780
 on alcohol and its disruption of sleep.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.680
 But then we also know testosterone.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.180
 Peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep.

30:11.180 --> 30:12.720
 So the second half of the night.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.440
 Which is the second half of the night.

30:14.440 --> 30:18.680
 So it really just means that your profile

30:18.680 --> 30:23.200
 of mental and physical dysfunction will be different

30:23.200 --> 30:25.480
 under both of those conditions.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.900
 Which one would you prefer?

30:27.900 --> 30:29.440
 I would prefer neither of them.

30:29.440 --> 30:33.200
 And it really depends on what you're trying to optimize for.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.080
 So it's just so complete.

30:35.080 --> 30:39.320
 Sleep is just so plory potent.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.980
 It's so physiologically systemic

30:42.980 --> 30:46.840
 that it's almost impossible not to undergo

30:46.840 --> 30:49.360
 one of those two things, just deep sleep deprivation

30:49.360 --> 30:52.680
 or just REM sleep deprivation and not show a profile

30:52.680 --> 30:55.560
 that you would really prefer to avoid.

30:55.560 --> 30:59.580
 And that's the reason from an evolutionary standpoint

30:59.580 --> 31:02.040
 that we have preserved those stages of sleep.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.200
 I mean sleep is just so idiotic

31:05.200 --> 31:07.000
 from an evolutionary perspective.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.560
 Or maybe waking is idiotic.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.120
 Or waking is, you know, well yeah.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.960
 Based on your previous idea.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.800
 Who have you been talking to?

31:13.800 --> 31:16.340
 I think that comment is very specific to me.

31:16.340 --> 31:19.720
 Yeah, I am normally always an idiot when waking.

31:19.720 --> 31:24.720
 But I think this idea that sleep, you know,

31:25.280 --> 31:28.540
 is so profoundly detrimental to us.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.720
 If you were to take it at face value, you know,

31:30.720 --> 31:33.220
 you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing,

31:33.220 --> 31:34.560
 you're not foraging for food,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.160
 you're not caring for your young.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.280
 And worst of all, you're vulnerable to predation.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.080
 On any one of those grounds,

31:41.080 --> 31:44.000
 sleep probably should have been selected against.

31:44.000 --> 31:44.840
 But it wasn't.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.840
 Sleep has fought its way through heroically.

31:47.840 --> 31:51.040
 You know, every step along the evolutionary path.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.800
 And therefore every sleep stage

31:54.800 --> 31:58.220
 has also survived as best we can tell.

31:58.220 --> 32:01.240
 What that means is that those are non-negotiable.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.920
 If mother nature had found a way

32:03.920 --> 32:06.160
 to even just sort of, you know,

32:06.160 --> 32:09.240
 thin slice some of that sleep from us,

32:09.240 --> 32:12.880
 there would have been vast, I'm sure, evolutionary benefits.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.920
 But it looks as though she hasn't.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.860
 And I'm usually in favor of her wisdom

32:17.860 --> 32:20.360
 after 3.6 million years, so.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.480
 Yeah, it's incredible.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.760
 I want to introduce another Gedanken experiment,

32:25.760 --> 32:26.940
 another thought experiment.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.640
 So in this arc of the night,

32:28.640 --> 32:31.700
 slow-wave sleep predominates early in the night,

32:31.700 --> 32:33.460
 and then REM sleep.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.960
 There's a scenario that many people,

32:34.960 --> 32:37.680
 including myself, experience on a regular basis,

32:37.680 --> 32:41.400
 which is they go to sleep, sleeping just fine,

32:41.400 --> 32:43.720
 three, four hours into it, they wake up.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.400
 They wake up for whatever reason.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.400
 Maybe there was a noise, maybe the temperature isn't right.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.160
 We will certainly talk about sleep hygiene, et cetera.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.460
 They get up, they go to the restroom.

32:53.460 --> 32:56.200
 They might flip on the lights, they might not.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.640
 They'll get back in bed.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.520
 Hopefully they're not picking up their phone

32:59.520 --> 33:01.800
 and starting to browse and wake up the brain

33:01.800 --> 33:02.920
 through various mechanisms,

33:02.920 --> 33:05.400
 light and cognitive stimulation, et cetera.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.960
 They go back to sleep.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.680
 Let's say after about 10, 15 minutes,

33:08.680 --> 33:10.480
 they're able to fall back asleep.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.920
 And then they sleep till their more typical wake time.

33:12.920 --> 33:17.920
 How detrimental is that wake up episode or event

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
 in terms of longevity, learning, et cetera?

33:25.040 --> 33:27.800
 I would love to sleep the entire night through every night,

33:27.800 --> 33:29.760
 but most nights I don't.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.000
 And yet I feel pretty good throughout the day.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.640
 Some days better than others.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.800
 So if you were to kind of evaluate that waking episode

33:37.800 --> 33:42.420
 and compare it to sleeping the whole night through,

33:42.420 --> 33:44.520
 what are your thoughts on that?

33:44.520 --> 33:47.540
 So I think if you're waking up sort of frequently

33:47.540 --> 33:49.180
 as you're describing,

33:49.180 --> 33:51.320
 I would probably get your estate in order

33:51.320 --> 33:53.820
 because my guess is within the next year,

33:53.820 --> 33:57.500
 you're going to be done for, no, I'm kidding you.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.820
 Absolutely kidding you.

33:58.820 --> 34:01.700
 It is perfectly natural and normal,

34:01.700 --> 34:04.560
 particularly as we progress with age.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.240
 Children tend to have typically more continuous sleep.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.360
 Now it's not that they aren't waking up

34:10.360 --> 34:12.020
 for brief periods of time, they are.

34:12.020 --> 34:13.800
 And in fact, we all do.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.560
 When we come out the other end of our sleep cycle,

34:16.560 --> 34:21.140
 at the end of our REM sleep period of the 90 minute cycle,

34:21.140 --> 34:25.620
 almost everybody wakes up and we make a postural movement.

34:25.620 --> 34:28.760
 We turn over because we've been paralyzed for so long

34:28.760 --> 34:30.860
 and the body will also like to shift.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.900
 Do we ever look around?

34:31.900 --> 34:33.940
 Do we ever open our eyes and look around?

34:33.940 --> 34:36.560
 You sometimes people will open their eyes,

34:36.560 --> 34:39.180
 but usually it's only for a brief period of time

34:39.180 --> 34:42.940
 and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory.

34:42.940 --> 34:44.180
 Right.

34:44.180 --> 34:47.060
 Your situation and it's my situation as well.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.660
 I usually now at this stage of life,

34:48.660 --> 34:50.000
 I don't sleep through the night.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.920
 I'll usually have a bathroom break and then I'll come back.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.660
 That's perfectly normal.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.600
 We tend to forget that in sleep science,

35:00.600 --> 35:02.780
 we think of sleep efficiency.

35:02.780 --> 35:06.540
 So of the total amount of time that you're in bed,

35:06.540 --> 35:11.320
 how much of that percent time is spent asleep?

35:11.320 --> 35:16.180
 And we usually look to numbers that are above 85% or more

35:16.180 --> 35:19.180
 as a healthy sleep efficiency.

35:19.180 --> 35:22.980
 So if you were to think about me going to bed and I spend,

35:22.980 --> 35:25.540
 you know, let's say eight and a quarter,

35:25.540 --> 35:28.080
 eight and a half hours of time in bed

35:28.080 --> 35:31.460
 with a normal healthy sleep efficiency,

35:31.460 --> 35:35.860
 I still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half

35:35.860 --> 35:38.640
 hours or seven and three quarter hours,

35:38.640 --> 35:43.180
 meaning that I'm going to be awake in total,

35:43.180 --> 35:45.700
 not in one long bout,

35:45.700 --> 35:48.980
 but I'm going to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes,

35:48.980 --> 35:51.460
 net some time.

35:51.460 --> 35:54.960
 Sometimes that can be after a 10 minute, you know,

35:54.960 --> 35:56.920
 dalliance after having gone to the bathroom

35:56.920 --> 35:59.980
 and I'm just gradually drifting back off again.

35:59.980 --> 36:02.460
 Other times it will just be for a couple of minutes.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.680
 And most of those you don't commit.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.500
 So I think we need to stop.

36:06.500 --> 36:10.380
 We don't need to get too worried about, you know,

36:10.380 --> 36:11.940
 periods of time awake,

36:11.940 --> 36:13.620
 just because we're not sleeping throughout the night.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.460
 I would love to do that too.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.500
 And I remember when I, that used to happen

36:16.500 --> 36:18.540
 and it still happens occasionally.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.060
 It feels great when it does happen.

36:20.060 --> 36:21.100
 It's a lovely thing.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.420
 It's a surprise, right?

36:22.420 --> 36:24.260
 It is not now a surprise.

36:24.260 --> 36:25.820
 Yeah, it is a surprise.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.660
 But for the most part,

36:27.660 --> 36:30.060
 I think we can be more relaxed about that.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.020
 Where we have to be a bit more attentive though,

36:33.020 --> 36:36.220
 is if you are spending long periods of time,

36:36.220 --> 36:37.940
 not being able to get back to sleep.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.300
 And usually we define that by saying,

36:40.300 --> 36:42.900
 if it's been 20, 25 minutes,

36:42.900 --> 36:45.760
 normally that's a time when we would really say,

36:45.760 --> 36:48.060
 okay, let's explore this, what's going on.

36:48.060 --> 36:49.920
 Let's see what's happening.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.700
 The other thing is if it's happening very frequently.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.620
 So even if you're, you know,

36:55.620 --> 36:58.620
 not awake for 25 minute stretches,

36:58.620 --> 37:00.620
 but you're finding yourself waking up

37:00.620 --> 37:03.700
 and being consciously aware that you've woken up

37:03.700 --> 37:07.140
 for maybe six, seven or eight times throughout the night.

37:07.140 --> 37:09.960
 And your sleep is very, what we call fragmented.

37:10.940 --> 37:13.780
 The great science of sleep in the past five or 10 years

37:13.780 --> 37:17.780
 has been, yes, quantity is important,

37:17.780 --> 37:21.100
 but quality is just as important.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.740
 And you can't have one without the other

37:23.740 --> 37:27.640
 in terms of a good beneficial next day outcome.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.220
 You can't just get four hours of sleep,

37:30.220 --> 37:33.660
 but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired.

37:33.660 --> 37:36.340
 Nor can you get eight hours of sleep,

37:36.340 --> 37:38.780
 but have very poor quality of sleep

37:38.780 --> 37:41.620
 and be unimpaired the next day.

37:41.620 --> 37:45.900
 So that's why I just sort of want to asterisk this idea of,

37:45.900 --> 37:48.020
 let's not get too worried about waking up

37:48.020 --> 37:49.320
 and having some time awake.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.960
 That's perfectly normal and natural.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.860
 But if it's happening very frequently throughout the night

37:54.860 --> 37:58.020
 or those periods of time or long stretches of time,

37:58.020 --> 38:01.100
 upwards of 25 minutes, then let's look into it.

38:01.100 --> 38:04.380
 Well, I can assure you just helped a lot of people

38:04.380 --> 38:07.580
 feel better about this waking up episode

38:07.580 --> 38:09.800
 that I and many other people experience.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.780
 I hope so because I think it's really important that we,

38:13.780 --> 38:17.220
 you know, I think I've been desperately guilty

38:17.220 --> 38:21.100
 of perhaps, you know, early on being too puritanical

38:21.100 --> 38:26.100
 about, you know, sleep and I've, I've retrospected

38:26.100 --> 38:28.180
 and I've tried to explore why this was the case.

38:28.180 --> 38:32.220
 You know, it was almost sleep or else dot, dot, dot,

38:32.220 --> 38:35.940
 you know, and at the time when I was starting

38:35.940 --> 38:39.340
 to write the book, which was back in 2016,

38:39.340 --> 38:42.120
 you know, sleep was still a neglected step sister

38:42.120 --> 38:44.240
 in the health conversation of today.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.900
 And I could see all of the, and it's changing, you know,

38:47.900 --> 38:49.140
 and not because of my efforts,

38:49.140 --> 38:50.420
 but because of all of my colleagues.

38:50.420 --> 38:54.900
 I would say, well, it's great that you give attribution

38:54.900 --> 38:56.780
 to your other people involved in it.

38:56.780 --> 38:58.060
 Of course, it's a big field,

38:58.060 --> 39:01.380
 but I think you've done a great service by queuing people

39:01.380 --> 39:03.380
 to the importance of this state,

39:03.380 --> 39:06.740
 not just for avoiding troublesome outcomes,

39:06.740 --> 39:09.200
 but also for optimizing their waking state.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.420
 It's really, you know, I view sleep as this period

39:12.420 --> 39:14.500
 that feels good, but we're not aware of how it feels

39:14.500 --> 39:15.940
 when we're in it necessarily.

39:15.940 --> 39:19.140
 It has tremendous benefits when you're doing it well,

39:19.140 --> 39:24.100
 so to speak, and it has tremendous deficits when we're not.

39:24.100 --> 39:28.460
 And I think it was an important thing for you to do

39:28.460 --> 39:29.860
 to cue people to this issue.

39:29.860 --> 39:32.780
 And I would say mission accomplished,

39:32.780 --> 39:35.780
 that people are aware of the need for sleep.

39:35.780 --> 39:37.520
 I think that knowing that waking up

39:37.520 --> 39:39.660
 in the middle of the night is normal,

39:39.660 --> 39:42.260
 provided it's not too frequent, is great

39:42.260 --> 39:43.820
 and will also help people

39:43.820 --> 39:46.260
 who may have been overly concerned about that.

39:46.260 --> 39:49.840
 I do want to use this as an opportunity to raise something

39:49.840 --> 39:52.420
 about the so-called Uberman schedule,

39:52.420 --> 39:55.920
 not to be confused with the Huberman schedule.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.320
 Fortunately, no one has confused those yet.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.700
 Some years ago, there was a discussion

40:02.700 --> 40:04.960
 about the so-called Uberman schedule,

40:04.960 --> 40:06.580
 meaning the Superman schedule.

40:06.580 --> 40:08.340
 So that's Huberman without an H,

40:08.340 --> 40:09.940
 which I have nothing to do with.

40:11.020 --> 40:13.620
 If you read your Nietzsche, this will have a subtext.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.100
 But regardless, the Uberman schedule,

40:16.100 --> 40:20.220
 as I understand, is one in which the person

40:20.220 --> 40:22.860
 elects to sleep in 90-minute bouts

40:22.860 --> 40:25.440
 spread throughout the day and night

40:25.440 --> 40:28.420
 in an attempt to get more productivity

40:28.420 --> 40:30.740
 and or reduce their overall sleep need.

40:30.740 --> 40:32.480
 There was a paper published recently

40:32.480 --> 40:36.020
 that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.540
 Maybe you just give us the take-home message on that.

40:38.540 --> 40:41.660
 Yeah, so these Uberman-like schedules,

40:41.660 --> 40:44.220
 and there's lots of different forms of that,

40:44.220 --> 40:49.220
 they tried to essentially pie chart the 24-hour period

40:49.220 --> 40:53.700
 into short bouts of sleep with some shorter,

40:53.700 --> 40:55.700
 well, slightly longer periods of wakefulness,

40:55.700 --> 40:57.960
 then short bouts of sleep, then wakefulness.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.820
 I sort of made it, I think, a quip.

41:01.820 --> 41:04.140
 It's almost like you're sleeping like a baby,

41:04.140 --> 41:06.820
 because that's the way that babies will sleep.

41:06.820 --> 41:08.740
 That they will have these brief naps,

41:08.740 --> 41:10.280
 then they're awake, then they're asleep, then they're awake.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.120
 And to the chagrin of parents, across the night,

41:13.120 --> 41:14.640
 it's basically the same.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.780
 They're awake, they're asleep, they're awake, they're asleep.

41:16.780 --> 41:18.940
 And that's more the schedule

41:18.940 --> 41:23.640
 that these types of protocols have suggested.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.760
 And there was a really great comprehensive review

41:26.760 --> 41:30.620
 that found not only that they weren't necessarily helpful,

41:30.620 --> 41:33.280
 but they were actually really quite detrimental.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.880
 And on almost every performance metric,

41:35.880 --> 41:37.600
 whether it be task performance,

41:37.600 --> 41:40.340
 whether it be physiological outcome measures,

41:40.340 --> 41:43.020
 whether it even be the quality of the sleep

41:43.020 --> 41:45.820
 that they were having when they were trying to get it,

41:45.820 --> 41:48.860
 all of those were in a downward direction.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.140
 And it's not surprising.

41:50.140 --> 41:53.300
 If you look at the way that your physiology is programmed,

41:53.300 --> 41:56.420
 if you look at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed,

41:56.420 --> 41:58.360
 none of that screams to us

41:58.360 --> 42:02.160
 that we should be sleeping in that way.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.900
 Well, I'm chuckling because we always hear sleep like a baby.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.460
 This is how babies sleep.

42:06.460 --> 42:08.620
 And I would say, don't sleep like a baby,

42:08.620 --> 42:10.680
 sleep like an adult, be an adult.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.940
 Get your solid eight hours.

42:11.940 --> 42:14.820
 Billy Crystal's line, he was a long-standing,

42:14.820 --> 42:16.260
 suffering insomniac.

42:16.260 --> 42:19.580
 He says, I sleep like a baby, I'm awake every 20 minutes.

42:19.580 --> 42:23.520
 And I think this is another one of those demonstrations

42:23.520 --> 42:28.260
 that when you fight biology, you normally lose.

42:28.260 --> 42:29.860
 And the way you know you've lost

42:29.860 --> 42:32.580
 is disease, sickness, and impairment.

42:32.580 --> 42:35.940
 And I think if you sleep in accordance

42:35.940 --> 42:38.580
 with the natural biological edict

42:38.580 --> 42:40.260
 that we've all been given,

42:40.260 --> 42:43.180
 life tends to be both of a higher quality

42:43.180 --> 42:44.780
 and a longer duration.

42:44.780 --> 42:45.680
 Yeah, I agree.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.940
 Along those lines, as a vision scientist,

42:48.940 --> 42:50.380
 I've been very excited by the work

42:50.380 --> 42:52.500
 on these non-image-forming cells in the eye,

42:52.500 --> 42:54.620
 the so-called melanopsin cells that inform the brain

42:54.620 --> 42:56.420
 about circadian time of day.

42:56.420 --> 43:01.100
 And I'm a big proponent of people getting some sunlight,

43:01.100 --> 43:03.420
 ideally sunlight, but other forms of bright light

43:03.420 --> 43:04.880
 into their eyes early in the day

43:04.880 --> 43:06.780
 and when they want to be awake.

43:06.780 --> 43:09.020
 Essentially during the phase of their 24-hour

43:09.020 --> 43:12.420
 circadian cycle when temperature is rising

43:12.420 --> 43:15.620
 and then starting to get less light in their eyes

43:15.620 --> 43:17.680
 as our temperature is going down

43:17.680 --> 43:19.540
 later in the day and in the evening.

43:19.540 --> 43:22.360
 Are there any adjustments to that general theme

43:22.360 --> 43:25.900
 that you'd like to add or is, in any way?

43:25.900 --> 43:29.340
 No, I think that's exactly what we recommend right now,

43:29.340 --> 43:33.900
 which is try to get at least 30 to 40 minutes of exposure

43:33.900 --> 43:35.620
 to some kind of natural daylight.

43:35.620 --> 43:38.700
 Now, there may be parts of the world where, you know,

43:38.700 --> 43:39.540
 it's-

43:39.540 --> 43:41.380
 You're from a rather cloudy part of the world.

43:41.380 --> 43:44.700
 I am from, yeah, Liverpool, England

43:44.700 --> 43:47.820
 and the northwest of England is not known

43:47.820 --> 43:51.620
 for its beach resorts and fine weather.

43:51.620 --> 43:55.700
 I remember I sort of, I went back home for a trip

43:55.700 --> 43:58.380
 when I'd first been out in California

43:58.380 --> 44:01.300
 and I thought, why is the sky so low?

44:01.300 --> 44:03.900
 You know, it's just, you know, constantly out.

44:03.900 --> 44:06.940
 We joke that in the UK,

44:06.940 --> 44:09.660
 we usually have nine months of bad weather

44:09.660 --> 44:11.480
 and then three months of winter.

44:11.480 --> 44:15.420
 And then that's your entire year in terms of a climate.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.780
 But to come to your point, you're exactly right.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.000
 Try to get that daylight.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.480
 Now it can be, you know, working next to a window

44:22.480 --> 44:24.520
 and you're getting that natural sunlight.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.860
 But that natural sunlight is,

44:26.860 --> 44:28.880
 even on a cloudy day in England,

44:28.880 --> 44:31.880
 is usually far more potent than anything that you'll get

44:31.880 --> 44:34.300
 from indoor lighting.

44:34.300 --> 44:37.260
 Despite you thinking sort of from a perception-wise,

44:37.260 --> 44:40.640
 maybe they're much closer than I would think.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.300
 Yeah, I've been, sorry to interrupt,

44:42.300 --> 44:43.780
 I've been a big proponent of,

44:43.780 --> 44:46.420
 there's an app called Light Meter, which will,

44:46.420 --> 44:48.340
 it's a free app, I have nothing to do with it,

44:48.340 --> 44:51.080
 that will allow you to get a pretty decent measurement

44:51.080 --> 44:53.260
 of the amount of light energy coming toward you.

44:53.260 --> 44:56.940
 And if you hold it up to a cloudy morning

44:56.940 --> 44:58.280
 where you don't think it's very bright out,

44:58.280 --> 44:59.340
 kind of a dismal day,

44:59.340 --> 45:01.860
 you'll notice that there'll be a thousand, 2,000,

45:01.860 --> 45:04.460
 even, you know, 5,000 lux, lux just being a measure

45:04.460 --> 45:05.420
 of brightness, of course.

45:05.420 --> 45:07.960
 And then you can point the same light meter

45:07.960 --> 45:10.100
 toward an indoor light that seems very bright

45:10.100 --> 45:13.260
 and very intense, and it'll say 500 lux.

45:13.260 --> 45:15.160
 And you realize that the intensity

45:15.160 --> 45:18.340
 as we gauge it perceptually is not really

45:18.340 --> 45:19.540
 what the system is receiving.

45:19.540 --> 45:20.860
 So outdoor light is key.

45:20.860 --> 45:24.120
 How do you, how do you get this natural stimulation

45:24.120 --> 45:27.020
 or I should just say light stimulation early in the day?

45:27.020 --> 45:29.660
 What is your typical, what does Matt Walker do

45:29.660 --> 45:31.120
 to get this light stimulation?

45:31.120 --> 45:35.520
 I am no poster child, but usually I will,

45:35.520 --> 45:38.500
 if I'm working out, I usually work out most days.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.240
 And I shopped around and I found a gym

45:41.240 --> 45:45.580
 that has huge amounts of window exposure facing to the east.

45:45.580 --> 45:48.700
 This is gonna sound so ridiculous.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.420
 You know, Matt Walker chooses a gym

45:50.420 --> 45:52.940
 on the basis of the solar input.

45:52.940 --> 45:54.020
 So he can, you know, correct a circadian.

45:54.020 --> 45:55.980
 There are a lot of criteria for selecting gyms.

45:55.980 --> 45:59.720
 This one is actually grounded in physiology and biology.

45:59.720 --> 46:02.020
 And selfishness about my own sleep.

46:02.020 --> 46:02.860
 No, that's great.

46:02.860 --> 46:05.140
 So you get your exercise and your light stimulation

46:05.140 --> 46:05.980
 simultaneously. That's right.

46:05.980 --> 46:06.800
 Yep, yep.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.900
 And so you're stacking cues for wakefulness

46:08.900 --> 46:09.720
 early in the day.

46:09.720 --> 46:10.560
 Exactly.

46:10.560 --> 46:14.180
 So both exercise and daylight are wonderful cues

46:14.180 --> 46:16.420
 for circadian rhythm alignment

46:16.420 --> 46:19.260
 and also circadian rhythm reset each day.

46:19.260 --> 46:22.020
 And so I will use both exercise.

46:22.020 --> 46:24.640
 I mean, I am, I'm neither a strong morning type

46:24.640 --> 46:25.980
 or a strong evening type.

46:25.980 --> 46:29.260
 And my preference to exercise is probably some time

46:29.260 --> 46:32.100
 in the middle of the day.

46:32.100 --> 46:35.020
 Probably somewhere around 1 p.m., sorry, not 1 a.m.

46:35.980 --> 46:39.500
 But I'm usually working out probably around

46:39.500 --> 46:44.500
 the sort of seven, sort of 45, 8 a.m. time.

46:44.900 --> 46:46.740
 That's usually when I'll start my workout.

46:46.740 --> 46:49.140
 And there I'll start with cardio, spin bike,

46:49.140 --> 46:50.340
 facing a window.

46:50.340 --> 46:53.180
 And luckily for the most part here in California,

46:53.180 --> 46:55.640
 there's usually sunlight coming through.

46:55.640 --> 46:58.720
 But it doesn't matter to me because just as you said,

46:58.720 --> 47:01.060
 even when it's a cloudy day,

47:01.060 --> 47:04.260
 that lux coming through of light,

47:04.260 --> 47:07.020
 the intensity is splendid.

47:07.020 --> 47:10.840
 So I would prefer to favor my exercise

47:10.840 --> 47:12.320
 just because for efficiency too,

47:12.320 --> 47:14.780
 I wanna get also working on the day.

47:15.880 --> 47:19.140
 I'll try to match my exercise

47:19.140 --> 47:22.080
 more with my circadian light exposure

47:22.080 --> 47:24.340
 than I would probably if I'm going to,

47:24.340 --> 47:26.060
 do I really wanna crush your workout

47:26.060 --> 47:30.120
 or do I want to just make sure it's a good workout?

47:30.120 --> 47:32.940
 I would prefer to work out at a different time.

47:32.940 --> 47:34.780
 But I like that because of the daylight.

47:34.780 --> 47:37.200
 And we can speak about exercise timing at some point

47:37.200 --> 47:38.820
 because there's a lot of discussion around that,

47:38.820 --> 47:41.660
 when is the right time to exercise during sleep?

47:41.660 --> 47:44.100
 And we can sort of bust some myths there too.

47:45.460 --> 47:49.040
 So I think you're spot on with the suggestion,

47:49.040 --> 47:52.260
 get some morning daylight, try to get that exposure,

47:52.260 --> 47:54.740
 usually at least 30 to 40 minutes.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.860
 There was some great work recently coming out

47:56.860 --> 47:59.040
 in the occupational health domain,

47:59.040 --> 48:01.580
 where they moved workers from offices

48:01.580 --> 48:03.220
 that were just facing walls

48:03.220 --> 48:06.700
 and didn't have any exposure to natural daylight.

48:06.700 --> 48:09.620
 And then they did a time period during that study

48:09.620 --> 48:12.940
 where they actually were in front of a window and working.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.760
 And they measured their sleep.

48:14.760 --> 48:17.820
 And their sleep time and their sleep efficiency

48:17.820 --> 48:19.500
 increased quite dramatically.

48:19.500 --> 48:20.700
 I'm forgetting the numbers now,

48:20.700 --> 48:23.140
 but I think the increase in total sleep time

48:23.140 --> 48:24.780
 was well over 30 minutes.

48:24.780 --> 48:28.740
 And the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to 10%.

48:28.740 --> 48:33.100
 And if you're batting an 80% sleep efficiency average,

48:33.100 --> 48:35.500
 we're a bit concerned about that.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.060
 But add 10% to that,

48:37.060 --> 48:40.660
 now you're in a great echelon of healthy sleepers.

48:40.660 --> 48:43.140
 And all you did was just spend some time

48:43.140 --> 48:44.400
 working in front of windows.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.240
 That's great.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.220
 And probably folks might want to consider

48:47.220 --> 48:48.820
 spending a little less time with sunglasses

48:48.820 --> 48:51.800
 provided they can do that safely, driving, et cetera.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.620
 You're not alone with your exercise behavior

48:53.620 --> 48:54.460
 in facing east.

48:54.460 --> 48:57.760
 So the one and only Tim Ferriss told me recently

48:57.760 --> 49:00.220
 that his morning routine nowadays

49:00.220 --> 49:03.240
 consists of jumping rope while facing east

49:03.240 --> 49:05.780
 to get the sunlight stimulation of the eyes.

49:05.780 --> 49:10.780
 And as Matt and I both know, it has to be of the eyes, right?

49:11.220 --> 49:14.180
 These portals are the only way to convey

49:14.180 --> 49:15.680
 to the rest of the brain and body

49:15.680 --> 49:18.000
 about the time of day and wakefulness.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.040
 Along the lines of wakefulness,

49:22.040 --> 49:24.480
 I have a number of questions about caffeine.

49:24.480 --> 49:26.720
 The dreaded and beloved caffeine.

49:26.720 --> 49:30.560
 I love caffeine, but I like it in relatively

49:33.020 --> 49:35.540
 restricted periods of time.

49:35.540 --> 49:38.800
 So I'm a big fan of waking up

49:38.800 --> 49:40.440
 and even though I wake up very groggy,

49:40.440 --> 49:43.920
 allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.640
 Meaning I wake up very slowly,

49:45.640 --> 49:47.760
 but I don't drink caffeine right away.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.200
 I sort of delay caffeine by a little while,

49:51.200 --> 49:53.520
 usually 90 minutes to two hours.

49:53.520 --> 49:58.040
 And that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding

49:58.040 --> 50:01.640
 of how caffeine and the adenosine receptor interact.

50:01.640 --> 50:02.760
 I have a feeling you're going to pronounce

50:02.760 --> 50:04.000
 adenosine differently than I do.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.320
 No, no, no, I will go with adenosine.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.200
 I'll try to go with your skeletal

50:08.200 --> 50:11.440
 instead of skeletal and synapse and synapse.

50:11.440 --> 50:12.520
 Schedule and schedule.

50:12.520 --> 50:13.340
 There we go.

50:13.340 --> 50:17.560
 But to make it really simple for folks,

50:17.560 --> 50:21.720
 how does caffeine work to make us feel more alert?

50:21.720 --> 50:25.560
 And does the timing in which we ingest caffeine

50:25.560 --> 50:27.800
 play an important role in whether or not

50:27.800 --> 50:30.080
 it works for us or against us?

50:30.080 --> 50:32.960
 So maybe we just start with how does caffeine work?

50:32.960 --> 50:35.560
 Why is it that when I drink mate or coffee,

50:35.560 --> 50:37.620
 which are my preferred sources of caffeine,

50:37.620 --> 50:40.380
 do I feel a mental and physical lift?

50:40.380 --> 50:43.160
 Yeah, so I'm going to suggest counter

50:43.160 --> 50:47.640
 to what most people would think, drink coffee.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.200
 Or mate, is mate okay also?

50:50.200 --> 50:51.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:51.040 --> 50:51.880
 Or whatever form you enjoy.

50:51.880 --> 50:55.120
 Well, we'll come on to sort of why I suggest that,

50:55.120 --> 50:58.060
 but when it comes to coffee,

50:58.060 --> 51:02.920
 I would say the dose and the timing makes the poison.

51:02.920 --> 51:06.720
 So let's start with how caffeine works.

51:06.720 --> 51:08.460
 Caffeine is in a class of drugs

51:08.460 --> 51:11.100
 that we call the psychoactive stimulants.

51:11.100 --> 51:15.540
 So it works through a variety of mechanisms.

51:15.540 --> 51:18.380
 One is a dopamine mechanism.

51:18.380 --> 51:21.860
 Dopamine we often think of as a reward chemical,

51:21.860 --> 51:24.900
 but dopamine is also very much

51:24.900 --> 51:27.740
 an alerting neurochemical as well.

51:27.740 --> 51:30.460
 And caffeine has some role it seems to play

51:30.460 --> 51:32.200
 in increasing dopamine,

51:32.200 --> 51:34.980
 but it's principle mode of action we believe

51:34.980 --> 51:36.960
 in terms of making me more alert

51:36.960 --> 51:39.720
 and keeping me awake throughout the day

51:39.720 --> 51:42.260
 is on the effects of adenosine.

51:42.260 --> 51:43.920
 And to explain what adenosine is,

51:43.920 --> 51:46.900
 from the moment that you and I woke up this morning,

51:46.900 --> 51:51.060
 this chemical adenosine has been building up in our brain.

51:51.060 --> 51:52.820
 And the longer that we're awake,

51:52.820 --> 51:55.300
 the more of that adenosine accumulates.

51:55.300 --> 51:59.380
 Is it, may I ask, is it accumulating in neurons,

51:59.380 --> 52:02.140
 in glia or in the blood vessels?

52:02.140 --> 52:05.340
 Where, and is it also accumulating in my body?

52:05.340 --> 52:07.140
 Where is this adenosine coming from

52:07.140 --> 52:08.260
 and where is it accumulating?

52:08.260 --> 52:10.940
 Yeah, so the adenosine here that we're talking about

52:10.940 --> 52:12.620
 that is creating the sleep pressure

52:12.620 --> 52:14.980
 is a central brain phenomenon.

52:14.980 --> 52:19.260
 And it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy.

52:19.260 --> 52:20.980
 And as they're combusting energy,

52:20.980 --> 52:25.980
 one of the offshoots of that is this chemical adenosine.

52:26.140 --> 52:28.260
 And so as we're awake throughout the day

52:28.260 --> 52:31.360
 and our brain is metabolically very active,

52:31.360 --> 52:35.820
 it's accumulating and building up this adenosine.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.980
 Now, the more adenosine that we have,

52:38.980 --> 52:41.180
 the sleepier that we will feel.

52:41.180 --> 52:45.680
 So it really is like a sleep pressure is what we call it.

52:45.680 --> 52:47.500
 Now, it's not a mechanical pressure.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.000
 Don't worry, your head's not going to explode.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.460
 It's a chemical pressure.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.780
 And it's this weight of sleepiness

52:53.780 --> 52:57.580
 that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening.

52:57.580 --> 53:00.220
 May I just interrupt you again to just ask,

53:00.220 --> 53:03.020
 do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that?

53:03.020 --> 53:05.660
 I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole,

53:05.660 --> 53:08.680
 but for the aficionados and for myself,

53:08.680 --> 53:11.300
 we have brain mechanisms like locus coeruleus

53:11.300 --> 53:14.100
 that release things that our brain areas,

53:14.100 --> 53:15.620
 locus coeruleus just being a brain area, of course,

53:15.620 --> 53:20.220
 that release things that proactively create wakefulness.

53:20.220 --> 53:21.940
 So are those neurons shutting down

53:21.940 --> 53:24.980
 as a consequence of having too much adenosine

53:24.980 --> 53:29.600
 or are there areas of the brain that promote sleepiness

53:29.600 --> 53:31.180
 that are becoming activated?

53:31.180 --> 53:33.740
 Because you can imagine both things working in parallel.

53:33.740 --> 53:36.140
 One or the other would accomplish the same end point.

53:36.140 --> 53:38.300
 Yeah, and it's both.

53:38.300 --> 53:41.300
 And so there are two main receptors for adenosine,

53:41.300 --> 53:44.780
 the A1 receptor and the A2 receptor,

53:44.780 --> 53:48.240
 and they have different modes of activating brain cells

53:48.240 --> 53:52.780
 or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing.

53:52.780 --> 53:56.660
 And adenosine works in this beautiful, elegant way

53:56.660 --> 53:59.660
 where it will inhibit and shut down

53:59.660 --> 54:02.500
 the wake promoting areas of the brain

54:02.500 --> 54:06.540
 whilst also increasing and dialing up the volume

54:06.540 --> 54:08.580
 on sleep activating, sleep promoting.

54:08.580 --> 54:10.020
 Biology is so beautiful.

54:10.020 --> 54:11.620
 Oh, it's always a push-pull.

54:11.620 --> 54:12.460
 Yeah.

54:12.460 --> 54:13.500
 I mean, and we could have a larger discussion

54:13.500 --> 54:16.340
 at some point about that everything,

54:16.340 --> 54:18.660
 seeing dark edges, seeing light edges,

54:18.660 --> 54:21.820
 our ability to smell or to sense pressure on this,

54:21.820 --> 54:22.660
 everything's a push-pull in biology.

54:22.660 --> 54:23.760
 Oh, that's great, yeah, yep.

54:23.760 --> 54:28.240
 So this is another example where as I am awake longer,

54:28.240 --> 54:30.760
 adenosine is released in the brain

54:30.760 --> 54:34.300
 and my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down

54:34.300 --> 54:37.820
 by that adenosine and my sleepiness brain areas,

54:37.820 --> 54:41.100
 so to speak, are being promoted to be more active.

54:41.100 --> 54:41.940
 Is that correct?

54:41.940 --> 54:44.060
 That's right, and it's a very progressive process.

54:44.060 --> 54:46.500
 It's not like a step function where,

54:46.500 --> 54:49.020
 and sometimes that happens occasionally,

54:49.020 --> 54:51.660
 but it's usually because you've been sort of driving through

54:51.660 --> 54:54.500
 and as we'll come on to have caffeine in the system.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.400
 And then all of a sudden you just hit a wall

54:56.400 --> 55:00.220
 and it just engulfs you and you go from a zero

55:00.220 --> 55:03.160
 to the one of sleepiness within a short period of time.

55:03.160 --> 55:06.580
 What explains the fatigue after a hard conversation?

55:06.580 --> 55:07.820
 The desire to go to sleep

55:07.820 --> 55:11.620
 or the desire to go to sleep during a hard conversation.

55:11.620 --> 55:12.540
 That's an interesting one.

55:12.540 --> 55:13.980
 I think it's usually just based

55:13.980 --> 55:16.940
 on personality type interactions and for the most part-

55:16.940 --> 55:18.380
 Not that I've ever experienced that before.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.740
 No, people with you don't, but with me, they always-

55:20.740 --> 55:22.800
 Oh, no, no, no, I mean, I've experienced the desire

55:22.800 --> 55:26.500
 to take some conversations, I'm halfway through them

55:26.500 --> 55:30.100
 and I feel like I want to take a nap, right?

55:30.100 --> 55:32.620
 And I would love to look at people's sleep history.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.820
 We've sort of seen that time and time again,

55:34.820 --> 55:38.040
 but, and then it could be with folks like me,

55:38.040 --> 55:39.580
 people just lose the will to live

55:39.580 --> 55:41.420
 within about five minutes of speaking with me.

55:41.420 --> 55:42.620
 So that's- Not true.

55:42.620 --> 55:43.940
 They hear that sleep is important.

55:43.940 --> 55:46.180
 And unrelated and that's flattery, that's great.

55:46.180 --> 55:50.580
 But so the way that then caffeine comes into this equation,

55:50.580 --> 55:53.060
 as I was saying, it's usually a kind of a linear process

55:53.060 --> 55:55.620
 or maybe it's probably closer to an exponential

55:55.620 --> 55:59.340
 in terms of your subjective feeling of sleepiness.

55:59.340 --> 56:02.600
 And we haven't really been able to measure that in humans

56:02.600 --> 56:05.620
 because normally it's hard to actually

56:05.620 --> 56:08.340
 stick something into the brain and be sucking,

56:08.340 --> 56:10.420
 siphoning off stuff every couple of minutes

56:10.420 --> 56:12.020
 as you could do in animal studies

56:12.020 --> 56:13.780
 and keep asking people every couple of minutes,

56:13.780 --> 56:15.440
 how sleepy do you feel, how sleepy?

56:15.440 --> 56:20.440
 And track to see if there's a linear rise in adenosine,

56:20.540 --> 56:23.140
 which then creates an exponential rise

56:23.140 --> 56:26.060
 in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are.

56:26.060 --> 56:27.580
 But I'm kind of nerding out.

56:27.580 --> 56:30.540
 So caffeine comes into play here

56:30.540 --> 56:34.060
 because caffeine comes into your system

56:34.060 --> 56:37.340
 and it latches onto those welcome sites of adenosine,

56:37.340 --> 56:39.740
 the adenosine receptors.

56:39.740 --> 56:42.860
 But what it doesn't do is latch onto them

56:42.860 --> 56:46.580
 and activate them because if it was doing that,

56:46.580 --> 56:48.840
 then it would, in lots of ways,

56:48.840 --> 56:51.640
 it would dial up more sort of sleepiness.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.220
 It does the opposite.

56:53.220 --> 56:56.540
 The way that caffeine works is that it comes in,

56:56.540 --> 57:00.660
 competes with quite sharp elbows with adenosine,

57:00.660 --> 57:03.580
 competitively forces them out of the way,

57:03.580 --> 57:07.100
 hijacks that receptor by latching onto it,

57:07.100 --> 57:09.860
 but then just essentially blocks it.

57:09.860 --> 57:12.740
 It doesn't inactivate the receptor.

57:12.740 --> 57:15.260
 It doesn't activate the receptor.

57:15.260 --> 57:18.960
 It functionally inactivates it in the sense

57:18.960 --> 57:21.900
 that it takes it out of the game for adenosine.

57:21.900 --> 57:25.380
 So it's like someone coming into a room

57:25.380 --> 57:27.460
 and you're just about to sit down on the chair

57:27.460 --> 57:29.300
 and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair

57:29.300 --> 57:32.060
 and you're like, well, now I've got nowhere to sit.

57:32.060 --> 57:34.220
 And caffeine just keeps pulling out the chairs

57:34.220 --> 57:36.460
 from adenosine and adenosine,

57:36.460 --> 57:40.500
 even though it's at the same concentration in your brain,

57:40.500 --> 57:43.620
 your brain doesn't know that you've been awake

57:43.620 --> 57:47.660
 for 10 hours, 16 hours at that point

57:47.660 --> 57:50.040
 when you've downed a cup of coffee

57:50.040 --> 57:54.060
 because all of that adenosine that's still there

57:54.060 --> 57:57.140
 can't communicate to the brain

57:57.140 --> 57:59.580
 that you've been awake for 16 hours because-

57:59.580 --> 58:01.120
 But the adenosine is still in brain-

58:01.120 --> 58:02.580
 Correct.

58:02.580 --> 58:03.940
 So the real question is what happens

58:03.940 --> 58:07.260
 when caffeine is dislodged from the adenosine receptor?

58:07.260 --> 58:08.620
 Unfortunate things happen.

58:08.620 --> 58:10.700
 And that's what we call the caffeine crash,

58:10.700 --> 58:15.380
 which is caffeine has a half-life and it's metabolized.

58:15.380 --> 58:16.740
 Do you recall what the half-life is?

58:16.740 --> 58:20.400
 Yeah, the half-life is somewhere between five to six hours

58:20.400 --> 58:22.140
 and the quarter-life therefore is somewhere

58:22.140 --> 58:24.180
 between 10 to 12 hours.

58:24.180 --> 58:25.260
 It's variable.

58:25.260 --> 58:29.820
 Different people have different durations of its action,

58:29.820 --> 58:32.320
 but for the average adult, five to six hours.

58:32.320 --> 58:35.780
 That variation, we understand it's down to a liver enzyme

58:35.780 --> 58:38.200
 or a set of liver enzymes of the class

58:38.200 --> 58:41.300
 that we call the cytochrome P450 enzymes.

58:41.300 --> 58:45.100
 And there are, I think last I delved into the data,

58:45.100 --> 58:48.820
 which is pretty recently, there are two gene variants

58:48.820 --> 58:52.300
 that will dictate the enzymatic speed

58:52.300 --> 58:54.980
 with which the liver breaks down caffeine.

58:54.980 --> 58:56.440
 And that's why you can have some people

58:56.440 --> 58:58.820
 who are very sensitive to caffeine

58:58.820 --> 59:00.420
 and other people who say,

59:00.420 --> 59:02.980
 I'm just doesn't affect me really that much at all.

59:02.980 --> 59:04.500
 These are the people that have a double espresso

59:04.500 --> 59:07.160
 after a 9 p.m. dinner and can sleep just fine.

59:07.160 --> 59:08.000
 Well, and we'll come on to-

59:08.000 --> 59:10.380
 Or at least subjectively they think they're sleeping.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.220
 Yeah, and we should speak about that,

59:12.220 --> 59:14.820
 that assumptive danger too.

59:14.820 --> 59:18.300
 So then the caffeine is in the system

59:18.300 --> 59:20.120
 and after some time period,

59:20.120 --> 59:23.420
 it will be inactive in the system.

59:23.420 --> 59:27.200
 So let's say that I've been awake for 12 hours now

59:27.200 --> 59:31.140
 and it's 8 p.m. and I'm feeling a bit tired,

59:31.140 --> 59:32.340
 but I want to push through

59:32.340 --> 59:34.980
 and I want to keep working for another couple of hours.

59:34.980 --> 59:36.580
 So I have a cup of coffee.

59:36.580 --> 59:38.660
 All of a sudden I was feeling tired,

59:38.660 --> 59:41.780
 but I don't feel like I've been awake for 12 hours anymore

59:41.780 --> 59:43.900
 because with the caffeine in the system,

59:43.900 --> 59:46.480
 maybe only half of that adenosine

59:46.480 --> 59:50.460
 is being communicated through the receptor to my brain.

59:50.460 --> 59:53.080
 100% of the adenosine is still there.

59:53.080 --> 59:55.380
 Only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain.

59:55.380 --> 59:56.380
 So now I think,

59:56.380 --> 59:57.700
 well, I haven't been awake for 12 hours,

59:57.700 --> 1:00:00.340
 I've just been awake for six hours, I feel great.

1:00:00.340 --> 1:00:01.980
 Then after a few hours

1:00:01.980 --> 1:00:05.080
 and the caffeine is starting to come out of my system,

1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:09.220
 not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine

1:00:09.220 --> 1:00:11.940
 that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee

1:00:11.940 --> 1:00:13.300
 several hours ago,

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:16.180
 it's that plus all of the adenosine

1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:17.380
 that's been building up

1:00:17.380 --> 1:00:20.700
 during the time that the caffeine has been in my system.

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.620
 So sort of an avalanche of adenosine.

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:24.620
 It is a tsunami wave.

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:25.940
 And that's the caffeine crash.

1:00:25.940 --> 1:00:28.340
 And it's interesting because the caffeine crash

1:00:28.340 --> 1:00:29.900
 at two o'clock in the afternoon

1:00:29.900 --> 1:00:32.320
 when you have work to do is a terrible thing.

1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:34.920
 But what about the person,

1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:37.180
 maybe this person is me in my 20s,

1:00:37.180 --> 1:00:40.880
 who says, I'm going to drink caffeine all day long

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:44.500
 and then I want the crash because at nine or 10 PM,

1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:48.780
 if I stopped drinking caffeine at say six PM and I crash,

1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:53.260
 then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of sleep.

1:00:53.260 --> 1:00:55.660
 Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is?

1:00:55.660 --> 1:00:57.700
 Because given the half-life of caffeine

1:00:57.700 --> 1:01:00.440
 that you mentioned a few moments ago,

1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:02.980
 I have to imagine that having some of that caffeine

1:01:02.980 --> 1:01:06.560
 circulating in my system might disrupt the depth of sleep

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:09.220
 or somehow the architecture of sleep in a way

1:01:09.220 --> 1:01:13.460
 that even if I get eight or who knows even 10 hours of sleep

1:01:13.460 --> 1:01:16.940
 it might not be as restorative as I would like it to be.

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:19.060
 Yeah, and that is the danger.

1:01:19.060 --> 1:01:22.220
 Just sort of those people that you described who say,

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:24.780
 and a lot of them will speak with me too,

1:01:24.780 --> 1:01:27.460
 say, look, I can have two espressos with dinner

1:01:27.460 --> 1:01:29.860
 and I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:32.220
 because usually those are the two phenotypes

1:01:32.220 --> 1:01:34.460
 that we typically see with too much caffeine.

1:01:34.460 --> 1:01:37.100
 I just can't fall asleep as easily as I want to,

1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:39.540
 or I fall asleep but I just can't stay asleep

1:01:39.540 --> 1:01:42.180
 and caffeine can do both of those things quite potently.

1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:44.540
 How late in the day do you think is,

1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:46.660
 assuming somebody, translate this folks,

1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:48.060
 if you go to bed earlier or later

1:01:48.060 --> 1:01:49.700
 you have to shift the hours accordingly,

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:52.960
 but given somebody who typically gets into bed

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:57.960
 around 10, 10, 30 and falls asleep around 11, 11, 30,

1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:02.660
 when would you recommend they halt caffeine intake?

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.620
 And these are not strict prescriptives

1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:05.860
 but I think people do benefit

1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:08.460
 from having some fairly clear guidelines

1:02:08.460 --> 1:02:10.980
 of what might work for them.

1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:15.020
 Would you say cut off caffeine by what time of the day?

1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:17.820
 I would usually say take your typical bedtime

1:02:17.820 --> 1:02:21.720
 and count back sort of somewhere between 10 to eight hours

1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:23.360
 is probably getting a little bit close,

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:27.220
 but take back sort of 10 hours or eight hours of time.

1:02:27.220 --> 1:02:31.500
 That's the time when you should really stop using caffeine

1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:33.100
 is the suggestion.

1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:34.780
 And the reason is because for those people

1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:39.460
 who even just keep drinking up until into the evening,

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:41.520
 you're right that they can fall asleep fine,

1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:42.560
 maybe they stay asleep,

1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:46.640
 but the depth of their deep sleep is not as deep anymore.

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:49.000
 And so there are two consequences.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.180
 The first is that for me, and it can be up to by 30%,

1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:55.700
 and for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,

1:02:55.700 --> 1:02:59.440
 I'd have to age you by between 10 to 12 years,

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:01.380
 or you can just do it every night to yourself

1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:03.560
 with a couple of espressos.

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:07.480
 The second is that you then wake up the next morning

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:10.740
 and you think, well, I didn't have problems falling asleep

1:03:10.740 --> 1:03:13.380
 and I didn't have problems staying asleep,

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:15.860
 but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep.

1:03:15.860 --> 1:03:18.700
 So now I'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee

1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:19.520
 the next morning,

1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:21.660
 rather than just two or three cups of coffee.

1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:24.300
 And so goes this dependency cycle

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:28.000
 that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.060
 and then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening

1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:34.300
 to bring them down because they're overly caffeinated

1:03:34.300 --> 1:03:36.180
 and alcohol, and we can speak about that too,

1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:39.740
 also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well.

1:03:39.740 --> 1:03:44.000
 So you're right that it's not just the quantity

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.340
 of your sleep or even difficulties falling

1:03:46.340 --> 1:03:49.340
 or staying asleep, it can also be deep sleep.

1:03:49.340 --> 1:03:51.060
 But here again, I think,

1:03:51.060 --> 1:03:53.180
 I don't want to be frightening people.

1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:54.140
 And I mentioned this before,

1:03:54.140 --> 1:03:56.300
 I think one of the real problems that I,

1:03:56.300 --> 1:03:58.000
 or mistakes that I made,

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.180
 because I didn't,

1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:01.960
 I'd never had much public exposure before the book.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:06.440
 And I was so saddened by, you know,

1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:08.980
 the disease and the suffering that I was seeing

1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:12.640
 as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society.

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:14.800
 And the fact that it wasn't really being discussed

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:17.840
 very much, I sort of came out, you know,

1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:20.920
 a little bit headstrong, more than a little bit headstrong.

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:22.400
 And I think I was, you know,

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:27.400
 perhaps too much gas pedal and too little,

1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:30.280
 you know, brake as it were.

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:33.240
 And I don't think that's the right way

1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:38.120
 to approach health message within the public sphere.

1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:40.760
 And I've become much softer

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:43.380
 in how I think about these things.

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:46.600
 I have ideas about what the ideal world looks like

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:49.480
 for sleep, but I also realized that none of us live

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:51.680
 in this thing called the ideal world.

1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:52.520
 We certainly don't.

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:55.240
 So, you know, I want to be really mindful of that.

1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:57.000
 And I think I've done a really bad job

1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.840
 of being sort of too forthright,

1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:01.100
 particularly for people who struggle with sleep.

1:05:01.100 --> 1:05:03.880
 You know, early on when I would offer these sort

1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:08.640
 of messages about sleep, I want to be, you know,

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:10.860
 I want to be veritical when it comes to the science.

1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:13.080
 I want to be faithful to the science,

1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:14.560
 but I also don't want to go out

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.420
 and scare the living daylight set of people,

1:05:16.420 --> 1:05:19.040
 particularly people who are struggling with their sleep,

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:21.560
 because it's probably only gonna make matters worse.

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:25.920
 So I've been beautifully schooled by learning

1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:27.960
 how to be a slightly better public communicator.

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:30.360
 I'm nowhere near of the standing that you are.

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.960
 You're very elegant and it's very intuitive to you.

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:34.800
 I'm still with training wheels,

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:36.360
 but I'm getting a little bit better,

1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:39.160
 but I just want to say that when I'm speaking about caffeine

1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:42.940
 because it sounds as though I'm very sort of overt about it,

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:46.580
 but I will come back to why I say drink coffee,

1:05:46.580 --> 1:05:48.000
 but I just want to make that point.

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:49.520
 Yeah, well, I appreciate you making that point

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:52.040
 and I'm sure our listeners will too.

1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:56.580
 I still will stand behind my statement,

1:05:56.580 --> 1:05:59.440
 which is that what you've done for the notion

1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:02.880
 that sleep is vital for all aspects of health

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:06.160
 and for performance, mental, and physical, and wakefulness,

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:09.120
 the message and the packaging it was contained in

1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:13.320
 and has been clearly, clearly net positive.

1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:15.600
 People needed to be cued to this.

1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:18.320
 The I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality is one that I had.

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.140
 It's one that other people have.

1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:22.320
 People in a huge number of vital communities,

1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:25.860
 not just your students, but also people.

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:28.440
 This, the messaging that you provided

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:31.380
 and continue to provide has positively impacted

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:34.520
 the first responder community, the medical community.

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.040
 There's still steps that need to be taken,

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:40.200
 the military community, and of course the civilian community.

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:42.560
 And so I think these adjustments about, yeah,

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:44.480
 caffeine's okay, just restrict it

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.080
 to the early part of the day if you can most days.

1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:48.600
 I mean, I think the law of averages,

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:50.360
 it's like the light viewing behavior.

1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:53.940
 I think it is critical to view sunlight or natural,

1:06:53.940 --> 1:06:56.060
 some other form of bright light early in the day.

1:06:56.060 --> 1:06:58.400
 But if you miss a day, it's not that your whole system

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:00.600
 is going to dissolve into a puddle of tears.

1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:02.760
 That'll happen on the second or the third day.

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:03.600
 No, I'm kidding.

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:04.440
 You got a couple of days.

1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:07.200
 Biology works in averages except

1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:09.640
 with respect to accident or injury.

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:11.480
 A car accident is a car accident, right?

1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:13.200
 You don't get to have three of those

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:14.960
 before the brain damage occurs

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.920
 if the accident is severe enough.

1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:18.080
 But with sleep behavior,

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:21.360
 these homeostatic type behaviors or with food,

1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:23.440
 one chocolate sundae, is it going to kill you?

1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:24.280
 No.

1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:26.720
 Every night, yeah, it's going to make you demented

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:27.640
 and kill you early.

1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:28.480
 We know this.

1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:30.680
 And so I think the middle ground

1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:32.360
 is often a hard place to achieve.

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.760
 So I think you've done a phenomenal job,

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:36.880
 but I appreciate you raising these points.

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:41.880
 And I think it's clear that we all need to,

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:45.000
 that we all can and should do certain things better,

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.280
 including being gentle with ourselves from time to time

1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:52.640
 when we deviate from these ideal circumstances.

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:55.520
 Along these lines, I do want to talk about alcohol

1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:57.600
 because I think caffeine and alcohol represent

1:07:57.600 --> 1:08:00.080
 the kind of two opposite ends of the spectrum.

1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:02.240
 Clearly, there are other stimulants.

1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:03.320
 There are your Adderalls

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:06.400
 and your high-energy drinks that people use.

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:10.200
 But alcohol and caffeine are the most commonly consumed,

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:11.760
 stimulants and sedatives,

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:13.960
 depressants as they're sometimes called.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:18.960
 So what happens when somebody has a glass,

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:22.600
 we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening

1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:27.600
 or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner,

1:08:28.140 --> 1:08:29.840
 how does that impact their sleep?

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:32.920
 And then we'll be sure to circle back

1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:35.960
 in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior

1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:38.960
 when it comes to avoiding alcohol

1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:42.920
 or if it's age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol.

1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:43.760
 Yeah.

1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:47.000
 So alcohol, if we're thinking about classes of drugs,

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.180
 they're in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives.

1:08:50.180 --> 1:08:51.860
 And I think one of the first problems

1:08:51.860 --> 1:08:53.620
 that people often mistake,

1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:57.760
 alcohol is often used as a sleep aid

1:08:57.760 --> 1:08:59.560
 for people who are struggling with sleep

1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:02.920
 when things like over-the-counter remedies, et cetera,

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:05.880
 or herbal remedies have just not worked out for them.

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:09.540
 And alcohol unfortunately is anything but a sleep aid.

1:09:09.540 --> 1:09:11.520
 The first reason that most people use it

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:14.260
 is to try and help them fall asleep.

1:09:14.260 --> 1:09:18.020
 And this process of this event that we call falling asleep,

1:09:18.020 --> 1:09:19.680
 I have to imagine is a process.

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:20.520
 It is a process.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:21.480
 Like everything in biology.

1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:24.820
 And that that process involves in some way,

1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:26.160
 as we talked about push pull before,

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:29.560
 turning off thinking, planning, et cetera,

1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:32.800
 and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism.

1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:34.680
 I have to imagine that these two things are knobs

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:36.000
 turning in opposite directions.

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.160
 That gives us this outcome we call falling asleep.

1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:41.940
 Alcohol, it seems is helpful for some people

1:09:41.940 --> 1:09:45.280
 to turn off their thoughts or their planning.

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:46.600
 Is that right?

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:47.520
 Yes, it is.

1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:50.920
 And so I think if we look at the pattern of brain activity,

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:53.300
 if I were to place you inside an MRI scanner,

1:09:53.300 --> 1:09:55.560
 where we're looking at the activity of your brain

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:57.140
 and watch you drifting off,

1:09:57.140 --> 1:10:00.160
 some parts of your brain will become less active.

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:02.000
 Other parts will become more active.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.920
 And this is the push pull model.

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:06.960
 It's inhibition excitation.

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:09.760
 But alcohol is quite different in that regard.

1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:12.420
 Alcohol is because it's a sedative.

1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:15.100
 What it's really doing is trying to essentially

1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:16.760
 knock out your cortex.

1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:20.040
 It's sedating your cortex.

1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:22.160
 And sedation is not sleep.

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:24.100
 But when we have a couple of drinks in the evening,

1:10:24.100 --> 1:10:25.740
 when we have a couple of night caps,

1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:28.240
 we mistake sedation for sleep saying,

1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:31.100
 well, I always when I have a couple of whiskeys

1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:32.440
 or a couple of cocktails,

1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:35.220
 it always helps me fall asleep faster.

1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:36.640
 In truth, what's happening is that

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:38.900
 you're losing consciousness quicker,

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:41.360
 but you're not necessarily falling

1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:44.060
 naturalistically asleep any quicker.

1:10:44.060 --> 1:10:46.320
 So that's one of the first sort of things

1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:47.740
 just to keep in mind.

1:10:47.740 --> 1:10:49.240
 The second thing with alcohol

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:51.160
 is that it fragments your sleep.

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:53.160
 And we spoke about the quality of your sleep

1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:56.360
 being just as important as the quantity.

1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:59.080
 And alcohol through a variety of mechanisms,

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.320
 some of which are activation

1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:03.160
 of that autonomic nervous system,

1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:06.520
 that fight or flight branch of the nervous system.

1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:09.140
 Alcohol will actually have you waking up

1:11:09.140 --> 1:11:11.220
 many more times throughout the night.

1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:14.360
 So your sleep is far less continuous.

1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.000
 Now, some of those awakenings

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.020
 will be of conscious recollection the next day.

1:11:19.020 --> 1:11:20.680
 You'll just remember waking up.

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:22.640
 Many of them won't be.

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:25.780
 And so, but yet your sleep will be littered

1:11:25.780 --> 1:11:28.720
 with these sort of punctured awakenings

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:29.560
 throughout the night.

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:31.920
 And again, when you wake up the next morning,

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.960
 you don't feel restored by your sleep.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.080
 You know, fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep

1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:40.480
 in this alcohol induced way

1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:42.500
 is usually not good quality sleep

1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:45.120
 that you feel great on the next day.

1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:48.960
 The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation

1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.040
 is that it's quite potent at blocking your REM sleep,

1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:53.960
 your rapid eye movement sleep.

1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:55.520
 And REM sleep is critical

1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:57.920
 for a variety of cognitive functions.

1:11:57.920 --> 1:11:59.800
 Some aspects of learning and memory

1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:01.360
 seems to be critical for aspects

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.200
 of emotional and mental health.

1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:04.240
 You've described it before

1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:06.840
 as a sort of self-generated therapy

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:08.260
 that occurs while we sleep.

1:12:08.260 --> 1:12:09.880
 Yeah, it's overnight therapy.

1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:12.600
 You know, it's emotional first aid.

1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:14.800
 Certainly people that don't get enough sleep

1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:17.480
 are very easy to derail emotionally.

1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:19.080
 Not that one would want to do that to people,

1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:23.200
 but we all sort of fall apart emotionally.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.800
 I always think about it as almost like

1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:27.400
 our skin sensitivity can be heightened

1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:29.080
 when we are sleep deprived.

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:33.520
 Our emotional sensitivity is such that

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:34.880
 when we're sleep deprived,

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:39.280
 such that it takes a much finer grain of sandpaper

1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:41.320
 to create that kind of friction.

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:42.760
 Things bother us.

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:45.280
 Threshold to trigger. Even online comments

1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:47.280
 bother us when we're sleep deprived.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.120
 And never when we're well rested.

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.120
 I would love to say that I never look at them,

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:54.640
 except I look at maybe every one of them.

1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:56.000
 Here I will editorialize

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.320
 because the notion of not looking at comments

1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.800
 is unreasonable to ask of any academic.

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:05.480
 Because academics, we are all trained

1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:07.760
 to look at our teaching evaluations.

1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:09.520
 And just like with online comments,

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:11.400
 to ignore 20% of them.

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:12.240
 No, I'm kidding.

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:13.360
 We look at them all.

1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:17.220
 In any event, so in terms of translating this to behavior,

1:13:17.220 --> 1:13:19.360
 I'm not, I don't particularly enjoy alcohol.

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:21.420
 I guess I might be fortunate in that sense,

1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:23.440
 but I also have never really experienced

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:25.920
 the pleasure of drinking alcohol.

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:27.920
 I sometimes like the taste of a drink,

1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:29.440
 but I never liked the sensation.

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:32.360
 So that's, I don't have a lot of familiarity with this,

1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.600
 but many people do, and I understand that.

1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:39.600
 So let's say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or two

1:13:39.740 --> 1:13:43.280
 with dinner and they eat dinner at 7 p.m.

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:46.800
 Is that likely to disrupt their sleep at all?

1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:49.600
 Let's just sort of, let's make this a series of gradations.

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:52.640
 Yeah, and the answer is yes.

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:56.320
 I think one study just looked at a single glass of wine

1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:57.920
 in the evening with dinner.

1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:02.640
 And I would be untruthful if I didn't just simply say

1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:06.360
 it has an effect and we can measure that

1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:07.740
 in terms of the actual- Less REM sleep.

1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:08.940
 Less REM sleep.

1:14:08.940 --> 1:14:10.680
 And one of the fascinating studies,

1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:12.040
 I can't remember what dose,

1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:15.280
 I think they got them close to a standard

1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.600
 illegal blood alcohol level.

1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.040
 So maybe they were a little bit tipsy.

1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:24.060
 And yes, you see all of the changes that we just described.

1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:26.200
 They sort of lose consciousness more quickly.

1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:27.560
 They have fragmented sleep

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:30.000
 and they have a significant reduction in REM sleep.

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.160
 But what was also interesting,

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:33.360
 because REM sleep, as we spoke about before,

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:36.280
 is a time when some hormonal systems

1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:38.760
 are essentially recharged and refreshed,

1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:40.600
 growth hormone being one of them,

1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:45.600
 there was well over a 50%, 5-0 drop in their growth hormone

1:14:45.780 --> 1:14:49.760
 release during alcohol-laced sleep at night.

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:50.600
 Wow.

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:53.000
 And growth hormone is so vital for metabolism

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.480
 and repair of tissues and-

1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:55.800
 Yeah, it's not just for kids.

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:56.640
 Keeping body fat low.

1:14:56.640 --> 1:14:58.560
 This is essentially adults, yeah.

1:14:58.560 --> 1:14:59.960
 Essential.

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:02.440
 Along those lines, I just want to highlight the fact

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:06.040
 that this information that you're sharing,

1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:09.640
 that growth hormone is released as strongly tethered

1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:13.360
 to the presence of healthy amounts of REM sleep,

1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:15.660
 is interesting to me because I always thought

1:15:15.660 --> 1:15:17.000
 that growth hormone was released

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.440
 in the early part of the night.

1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:21.440
 Well, it is released across both of those,

1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:23.720
 but across the different stages.

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:26.440
 But what we also know is that when you disrupt REM sleep,

1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:29.320
 there are those growth hormone consequences.

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:32.080
 So it's not an exclusive system.

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:33.820
 Just like with testosterone,

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:36.480
 we can see changes throughout non-REM sleep.

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:39.560
 But if you ask when are the peak release rates

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:42.720
 of testosterone, it's right before we go into REM sleep

1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:44.360
 and then during REM sleep.

1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.520
 And of course, testosterone being important

1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.840
 both for males and for females, right?

1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:51.480
 For libido and tissue repair and wellbeing.

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:54.880
 Nobody, regardless of chromosomal, hormonal,

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:56.360
 or any other background,

1:15:56.360 --> 1:15:58.560
 wants to have their normal levels

1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:00.880
 of testosterone reduced acutely.

1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:03.960
 That's just a bad, it equates to a terrible set

1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:05.720
 of psychological and physical symptoms.

1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:08.000
 Yeah, and the mortality risk that's associated

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.800
 with low testosterone is non-trivial.

1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:10.640
 Prostate cancer.

1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:12.000
 Right, exactly.

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:16.780
 So coming back to just the point on REM sleep

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:19.760
 that you mentioned regarding emotional instability,

1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:21.520
 and we see that, that's one of the things,

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.120
 one of the most reliable signatures

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:24.560
 of just insufficient sleep.

1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:26.740
 It doesn't have to be sleep deprivation.

1:16:26.740 --> 1:16:29.680
 What we've discovered over the past 20 years

1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:31.760
 here at the Sleep Center is that

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:36.240
 there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find

1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.400
 in which sleep is normal.

1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:40.240
 And so I think that firstly told us

1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:42.140
 there is a very intimate association

1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:45.680
 between your emotional mental health and your sleep health.

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:49.960
 But when it also comes to REM sleep,

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:53.480
 I think what's fascinating is that it's not just

1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:54.560
 about your emotional health.

1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:57.560
 It's not just about your hormonal health.

1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:01.760
 We've also been seeing other aspects of cognition,

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:03.940
 but then there was a report,

1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:06.820
 I think it could have been about two years ago,

1:17:06.820 --> 1:17:10.440
 out of Harvard, I think it was Beth Clearman's group.

1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:14.280
 They found that, and they replicated it

1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:16.640
 in two different large populations.

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:20.240
 If you look at the contribution of different sleep stages

1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:25.240
 to your lifespan, REM sleep was the strongest predictor

1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:27.840
 of your longevity.

1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:29.520
 And it was a linear relationship.

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.800
 It wasn't sort of one of these U-shape or J-shaped curves

1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:36.480
 that we often see with total sleep and mortality risk.

1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:38.000
 It really was linear.

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.420
 That the less and less REM sleep that you were getting,

1:17:40.420 --> 1:17:44.120
 the higher and higher your probability of death.

1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:44.960
 And then they did-

1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:47.920
 Was that death due to natural causes or accident?

1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:49.680
 Because I could imagine if you're not getting enough REM

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:51.800
 sleep, you're more likely to drive off the freeway,

1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:52.640
 step off a cliff.

1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:53.480
 Yeah, I think it was all cause and-

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:55.360
 Or just make bad decisions about anything

1:17:55.360 --> 1:17:58.560
 and love relationships, which can also be life threatening.

1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:01.240
 Yeah, I've tried to lean into that and claim that

1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:03.000
 with those bad relationship situations that,

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.240
 oh, I just didn't have enough REM sleep last night,

1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:06.080
 my darling.

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:07.240
 The REM sleep defense.

1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:10.720
 And, but she's far wiser than I thought.

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:15.720
 But so they did this great machine learning analysis

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:18.600
 and I may get these numbers backwards,

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:23.600
 but I think for every 5% reduction in REM sleep,

1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:28.960
 there was a 13% associated increased risk of mortality.

1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:31.980
 And I could have, I'll have to go back and check.

1:18:31.980 --> 1:18:36.120
 But to me, in the machine learning algorithm,

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:38.600
 what they ultimately spat out was that

1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:40.120
 of all of the sleep stages,

1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:43.360
 REM sleep is the most predictive of your longevity,

1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:44.820
 of your lifespan.

1:18:44.820 --> 1:18:46.840
 So we often, I hear people saying,

1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:48.600
 how can I get more deep sleep?

1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:51.840
 Or they sometimes say, how can I get more dream sleep?

1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:54.880
 And my answer is a question.

1:18:54.880 --> 1:18:56.680
 Why do you want to get more of that?

1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:58.940
 And they'll say, well, isn't that the good stuff?

1:18:58.940 --> 1:19:02.640
 And I'll say, well, actually all stages of sleep are, yeah.

1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:04.200
 Well, it's like the exercise question.

1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:07.500
 And it took decades for people to understand

1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:12.240
 that moving around at, for about 150,

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.920
 probably 180 minutes a week at doing endurance type work,

1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:18.060
 zone two cardio type work,

1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:20.560
 it is correlated with living longer,

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:22.360
 feeling better, less diabetes, et cetera.

1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:24.200
 There's really no way around it.

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:29.200
 I mean, you can ingest metformin until the cows come home.

1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:31.140
 You can take NMN,

1:19:31.140 --> 1:19:34.440
 all of which I think have their place in certain contexts.

1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:37.480
 I'm a big fan of the work surrounding all those protocols,

1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:41.480
 but without getting proper amounts of movement,

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:43.200
 meaning sufficient numbers.

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:46.140
 It doesn't matter how many 12 minute exercise regimes

1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:49.960
 you follow per week, you need that threshold level.

1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:53.000
 And it sounds like the same is true of REM sleep

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:54.440
 and total amount of sleep.

1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:58.160
 There's just, you pay the piper somehow.

1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:01.040
 Yeah, the return on investment, I mean, to flip the coin,

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:04.440
 the return on investment is astronomical.

1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:08.440
 I think of sleep, it is the tide that moves,

1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:10.920
 that raises all of those health boats.

1:20:10.920 --> 1:20:12.880
 And the most fundamental layer of mental

1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:14.000
 and physical health.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.480
 Whenever people ask me, even though I'm not a physician,

1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:19.640
 they'll ask me, what should I take or what should I do?

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:22.000
 The first question is always, how's your sleep?

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:23.720
 Meaning, how well do you sleep every night

1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:25.220
 and how long you sleep?

1:20:25.220 --> 1:20:26.820
 I always recommend your book.

1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:31.600
 I always recommend the podcast you've been a guest on,

1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:32.440
 et cetera.

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:36.560
 Who knows, maybe you'll even release your own podcast

1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:37.920
 at some point soon and keep,

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:40.520
 because I do think people need to hear from you more often.

1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:43.600
 One thing I don't want to return to the notion

1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:46.920
 of public health discourse too much, but I do want to say,

1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:51.800
 one issue with books in general is that they can be revised,

1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:54.200
 but it's more or less a one and done kind of thing

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:55.720
 until the next book comes out.

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:58.240
 One thing that I like about the podcast format

1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:00.360
 is that updates can be provided regularly,

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:03.400
 corrections and updates as new data come out.

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:06.680
 And so that's a wonderful aspect to this format

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:09.800
 and hopefully the format that you'll be embracing.

1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:13.360
 I think the world needs to hear more from you more often

1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:17.480
 about sleep and its various contours, not less.

1:21:17.480 --> 1:21:22.440
 And so I do have a question about drinking alcohol,

1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:24.640
 not that we want to promote day drinking,

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:29.020
 but let's say that the one or two glasses of wine

1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:31.360
 or a cocktail is consumed with lunch,

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:33.760
 something that isn't traditionally done nowadays,

1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:37.600
 or in a late afternoon happy hour cocktail,

1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:40.460
 and then one is going to sleep seven or eight hours later.

1:21:40.460 --> 1:21:43.720
 Do you think that that will improve

1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:46.120
 or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol?

1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:48.320
 Or if you have a drink,

1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:51.080
 are you basically screwed for the next 24 hours?

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:56.080
 No, I think there's going to be a time window dependency.

1:21:56.160 --> 1:21:59.220
 Now, I don't know of anyone who's essentially done

1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.400
 what you and I would like,

1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:04.720
 which is the time separation dose dependent curve

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:07.520
 where, okay, you drink at 10 a.m. then,

1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:10.000
 or 11, 12, one, two, three, four, five,

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.460
 all the way up to 10 p.m.,

1:22:12.460 --> 1:22:15.600
 and estimate what is the blast radius

1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:18.280
 and is it linear or is it non-linear?

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:22.200
 Is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours,

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:25.600
 do you just hit this exponential and it's bad, bad, bad,

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:28.840
 or is there some other curve that we could imagine

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:31.360
 that would be many possibilities?

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:34.600
 But certainly what we know is that the less alcohol

1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:36.280
 and the less, and more specifically,

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:39.280
 the metabolic byproducts, aldehydes and ketones,

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:41.680
 they're the sort of the nefarious players here.

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:44.480
 And not the ketones that people are all excited about,

1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:47.200
 the other ketones, the chemists know

1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:48.040
 what we're referring to.

1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:48.880
 But this is not about ketogenesis.

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:50.320
 This is not about ketogenesis.

1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:53.960
 There are ketone bodies that are released

1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:58.000
 after ingesting alcohol that are not of the positive sort

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.160
 that a ketogenic diet might promote.

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:01.000
 Right.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:05.860
 So I think in terms of that alcohol profile,

1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:08.140
 we certainly know that as you're heading

1:23:08.140 --> 1:23:10.200
 into the evening hours,

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:14.280
 once again, timing and dose make the poison,

1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:16.960
 but I think it's also important once again,

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:19.260
 from that public message standpoint, and thank you.

1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:23.040
 I think I am leaning into the sort of the podcast

1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:25.040
 consideration arena at some point,

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:28.720
 but I don't want to be puritanical here.

1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:32.200
 I'm just a scientist and I'm not here to tell anyone

1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:33.080
 how to live.

1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.840
 All I'm trying to do is empower people

1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:39.640
 with some of the scientific literature regarding sleep.

1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:42.500
 And then you can make whatever informed choices

1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:43.340
 that you want.

1:23:43.340 --> 1:23:46.360
 You know, unlike you, it turns out I'm not a big drinker.

1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:48.720
 It's just because I've never liked the taste.

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:50.980
 And I'm surprised that they haven't taken away

1:23:50.980 --> 1:23:54.160
 my British passport because I don't like lager or beer.

1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:59.080
 But I also want to say that life is to be lived

1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:00.480
 to a certain degree.

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:02.600
 It's all about checks and balances.

1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:05.380
 So, you know, if I go out and you know,

1:24:05.380 --> 1:24:08.200
 I have an ice cream sundae, I'm not big on those either,

1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:11.100
 but you know, sure I know that my, you know,

1:24:11.100 --> 1:24:13.340
 blood glucose is not gonna be ideal

1:24:13.340 --> 1:24:16.160
 for another 12 hours maybe.

1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:18.440
 That's just the price you pay for having

1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:20.800
 some kind of relaxed, fun life.

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:23.960
 I don't want to look back on life and think,

1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:28.240
 gosh, you know, I lived until I was, you know, 111

1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:31.480
 and it was utterly miserable, you know?

1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:34.760
 Right, so, but it's all about some kind of a balance.

1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:39.760
 And my job is not to tell people a prescription for life,

1:24:39.820 --> 1:24:42.240
 it's just to offer some scientific information.

1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:44.440
 I think you're doing a terrific job of that.

1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.100
 People are, I always say we have all these neural circuits

1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:50.320
 and if it's working properly, we all have a circuit

1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:53.960
 that allows us to skip over information or as we wish, right?

1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:56.540
 If the circuits between your brain and your thumbs

1:24:56.540 --> 1:24:58.880
 are working, you can slide right along,

1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:01.820
 you can drop to the next content, however you like.

1:25:01.820 --> 1:25:06.640
 I would like to ask about marijuana and CBD.

1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:08.580
 This is a discussion that I think five years ago

1:25:08.580 --> 1:25:10.520
 would have ventured into the realm of illegal,

1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:13.840
 but now in many places, not all,

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:16.340
 medical marijuana is approved or is legal

1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:20.560
 and certainly it's in widespread use.

1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:22.160
 Certainly not recommending people do it.

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:24.400
 I have my own thoughts about marijuana, CBD.

1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:26.480
 I've been fortunate, I suppose,

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.400
 that I don't particularly like marijuana or CBD.

1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:31.720
 I don't even know if I've ever tried CBD.

1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:37.700
 First of all, does marijuana disrupt the depth of sleep,

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:40.140
 the architecture of sleep?

1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:44.040
 And if so, as with alcohol and caffeine,

1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:48.600
 does when you ingest it or when it's in your bloodstream,

1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:50.740
 does relative to when you go to sleep,

1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:52.260
 does that play an important role?

1:25:52.260 --> 1:25:55.240
 So does marijuana disrupt sleep?

1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:00.240
 Yeah, it does, and there's a pretty good amount of data on,

1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:03.000
 so we can break sort of cannabis down

1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.640
 into two of its key ingredients.

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:10.480
 We've got THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, and we've got CBD.

1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:14.600
 And CBD is sort of the less,

1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:17.640
 what we think of as the non-psychoactive component.

1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:21.120
 In other words, when you take CBD, you don't get high.

1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:24.040
 If you take THC, you can get high.

1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:27.020
 That's the psychoactive part of the equation.

1:26:27.020 --> 1:26:30.360
 Are both considered sedatives in the technical sense?

1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:32.680
 No, they're not.

1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:36.900
 Neither of them have that class right now.

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:41.900
 THC can, seems to speed up the time

1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:44.280
 with which you fall asleep.

1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:48.160
 But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature

1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:51.560
 of your falling asleep with and without that THC,

1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:54.000
 it's not going to be an ideal fit.

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.460
 So you could argue it's non-natural,

1:26:56.460 --> 1:26:58.920
 but many people use THC for that fact

1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:01.600
 because they find it difficult to fall asleep.

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:05.440
 And it can speed the onset of at least non-consciousness,

1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:07.520
 I guess is the best way of describing it.

1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:11.880
 But there are problems with THC and there are twofold.

1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:15.080
 The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms

1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:16.920
 seems to block REM sleep.

1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:18.900
 And that's why a lot of people when they're using

1:27:18.900 --> 1:27:22.400
 will tell me, look, I definitely, I was dreaming.

1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:24.680
 I don't remember many of my dreams.

1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.080
 And then when they stop using THC,

1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:31.860
 they'll say, I was having just crazy, crazy dreams.

1:27:31.860 --> 1:27:35.340
 And the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism.

1:27:35.340 --> 1:27:38.460
 REM sleep is very clever and alcohol is the same way

1:27:38.460 --> 1:27:40.980
 in this sense, it's the same homeostatic mechanism.

1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:42.600
 Some people will tell me, look,

1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:46.440
 if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol,

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.780
 maybe I'll sleep late into the next morning.

1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:52.120
 And I'll just have these really intense dreams.

1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:54.800
 So, and I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep.

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:56.720
 Well, the way it works is that it's during

1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:59.040
 in the middle of the night, really,

1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:02.240
 when alcohol blocks your REM sleep.

1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:03.920
 And your brain is smart.

1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.880
 It understands how much REM sleep you should have had,

1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:08.640
 how much REM sleep you have not

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:10.680
 because the alcohol has been in the system.

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.760
 And finally, in those early morning hours

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:14.120
 when you're getting through to sort of,

1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:16.200
 you know, six, seven, eight AM,

1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:18.440
 all of a sudden your brain not only goes back

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:21.240
 to having the same amount of REM it would have had,

1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:24.160
 it does that, plus it tries to get back all

1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:25.760
 of the REM sleep that it's lost.

1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:27.560
 Does it get back all of the REM sleep?

1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:28.520
 No, it doesn't.

1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:31.720
 It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries.

1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:34.760
 And so you have these really intense periods of REM sleep.

1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:38.080
 Hence, you have really intense, bizarre dreams.

1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:40.540
 And that's what happens also with THC.

1:28:40.540 --> 1:28:44.020
 You build up this pressure for REM sleep,

1:28:44.020 --> 1:28:45.920
 this debt for REM sleep.

1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:48.160
 Will you ever pay it back?

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.100
 Doesn't seem as though you get back everything

1:28:50.100 --> 1:28:52.800
 that you lost, but will you get back some of it?

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:55.240
 Yes, the brain will start to devour more

1:28:55.240 --> 1:28:59.480
 because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long.

1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:02.200
 But one of the bigger problems with THC

1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:05.820
 that we worry about is withdrawal dependency.

1:29:05.820 --> 1:29:09.160
 So as you start to use THC for sleep,

1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:12.880
 there can be a dependency tolerance.

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:16.780
 So you start to need more to get the same sleep benefit.

1:29:16.780 --> 1:29:18.280
 And when you stop using,

1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:21.720
 you usually get a very severe rebound insomnia.

1:29:21.720 --> 1:29:24.500
 And in fact, it's so potent that it's typically part

1:29:24.500 --> 1:29:29.500
 of the clinical withdrawal profile from THC, from cannabis.

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:32.340
 And there's anxiety withdrawal.

1:29:35.200 --> 1:29:38.360
 I don't ask anybody to change their behavior.

1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:39.560
 We just, as you said,

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.600
 we try and inform people about what the science says

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.600
 and let them make choices for themselves.

1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:45.680
 People who are regular pot smokers,

1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:48.900
 that many will insist they're not addicted.

1:29:48.900 --> 1:29:52.660
 And maybe indeed they don't actually follow the profile

1:29:52.660 --> 1:29:53.820
 of classical addiction.

1:29:53.820 --> 1:29:54.660
 I don't know.

1:29:54.660 --> 1:29:56.200
 I'm guessing some do, some don't.

1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:58.460
 But if you ask them, well,

1:29:58.460 --> 1:30:01.700
 what if I took away all marijuana consumption

1:30:01.700 --> 1:30:04.480
 for, I don't know, two weeks?

1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:07.000
 That thought scares many of them.

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.240
 And many of them will experience intense anxiety

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:13.120
 without marijuana, which speaks to perhaps not addiction,

1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:15.360
 but a certain kind of dependency.

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:18.000
 And again, I know many pot smokers,

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.360
 some of whom have jobs that are quite high performing

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:22.840
 and they manage.

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:24.440
 Here in Berkeley, I don't know any of those.

1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:27.280
 Yeah, I know none of those, right.

1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:28.500
 What about CBD?

1:30:28.500 --> 1:30:30.000
 I mean, we hear so much about CBD.

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:31.560
 I've been a little concerned about the fact

1:30:31.560 --> 1:30:34.800
 that the analysis of a lot of CBD supplements out there

1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:37.400
 has confirmed that much like with melatonin,

1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:40.200
 the levels that are reported on the labels

1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:43.460
 in no way, shape, or form match the levels

1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:45.560
 that are actually contained in the various supplements.

1:30:45.560 --> 1:30:47.640
 Sometimes the levels are much higher

1:30:47.640 --> 1:30:49.600
 than they're reported on the labels.

1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:51.300
 Other times it's much lower.

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:56.200
 What does ingesting CBD do to the architecture

1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:58.280
 and quality of sleep?

1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:00.960
 Right now, I don't think we have enough data

1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:05.220
 to make some kind of meaningful sense out of it.

1:31:05.220 --> 1:31:07.760
 I think the picture that is emerging, however,

1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:09.720
 is probably the following.

1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:13.840
 Firstly, CBD does not seem to be detrimental

1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:16.240
 in the same ways that THC is.

1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:18.340
 So we can start by saying,

1:31:18.340 --> 1:31:22.340
 does it create potential problems?

1:31:22.340 --> 1:31:26.920
 Not of the nature necessarily that we see with THC,

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:29.840
 but the devil is a little bit in the details

1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:31.260
 from the data that we do have

1:31:31.260 --> 1:31:33.820
 and it comes onto your valid point of purity.

1:31:33.820 --> 1:31:38.820
 At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake promoting.

1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:43.460
 So in lower doses, let's say sort of five or 10 milligrams,

1:31:43.460 --> 1:31:44.880
 I'm trying to remember some of the studies

1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:46.640
 off the top of my head,

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:49.560
 there it actually may enhance wakefulness

1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:51.960
 and cause problems with sleep.

1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:54.620
 It's only once you get into the higher dose range

1:31:54.620 --> 1:31:59.620
 that there seem to have been some increases in sleepiness

1:31:59.620 --> 1:32:03.820
 or sort of sedation like increases.

1:32:03.820 --> 1:32:08.160
 And that's usually, I think above about 25 milligrams

1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:10.560
 as best I can recall from the data.

1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:13.840
 And then when we look in animal models,

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:17.900
 you typically see the same type of profile too.

1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:20.180
 So then the question becomes,

1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:23.860
 and now again, you just don't know about purity,

1:32:23.860 --> 1:32:25.440
 it's very difficult.

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:28.540
 Although I think, and again, I'm not a user,

1:32:28.540 --> 1:32:31.540
 not necessarily because I have anything against it,

1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:34.580
 it's just that's not necessarily my cup of tea.

1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:38.060
 There are some firms that are now doing

1:32:38.060 --> 1:32:41.140
 third party independent laboratory tests.

1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:43.100
 I don't know how gamed that is,

1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:43.940
 so I've got no sense of it.

1:32:43.940 --> 1:32:45.620
 No, I think some supplement companies

1:32:45.620 --> 1:32:47.660
 are quite honest and accurate

1:32:47.660 --> 1:32:49.740
 about the amounts of various substances

1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:53.460
 that are in other products and some are not.

1:32:53.460 --> 1:32:55.540
 And I think there's just a huge range.

1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:58.340
 I think the FDA is starting to explore CBD.

1:32:58.340 --> 1:33:01.300
 There are, certainly I saw some grant announcements

1:33:01.300 --> 1:33:03.260
 to explore the function of CBD.

1:33:03.260 --> 1:33:05.060
 Most of the work on CBD is being done

1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:07.660
 by the general public, ingesting it and seeing how they feel.

1:33:07.660 --> 1:33:10.180
 I gave it to my dog who had some

1:33:10.180 --> 1:33:11.980
 dementia-related sleep disturbances

1:33:11.980 --> 1:33:14.740
 and it actually created a heightened wakefulness.

1:33:14.740 --> 1:33:16.220
 It completely screwed up his sleep.

1:33:16.220 --> 1:33:19.220
 He's a bulldog, so if he's going to get access to sleep,

1:33:19.220 --> 1:33:21.140
 he's going to take it.

1:33:21.140 --> 1:33:24.440
 Really messed him up, took it away, he did better.

1:33:25.660 --> 1:33:27.660
 But that's a canine, so.

1:33:27.660 --> 1:33:29.260
 Right, and it could have been, you know,

1:33:29.260 --> 1:33:30.900
 sort of dose-related too, but-

1:33:30.900 --> 1:33:32.700
 Or binders or other things that are in there.

1:33:32.700 --> 1:33:35.260
 Correct, yeah, and we, but right now,

1:33:35.260 --> 1:33:38.300
 if we were to, and I'm not making this statement,

1:33:38.300 --> 1:33:39.980
 I don't think anyone can make the statement now,

1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:42.940
 but if it ends up being that CBD

1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:46.060
 is potentially beneficial for sleep,

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:49.300
 how can we reconcile that mechanistically?

1:33:49.300 --> 1:33:51.960
 And I think there are, to me at least,

1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:54.040
 there are at least three candidate mechanisms

1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:57.400
 that I've been exploring and thinking about.

1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:00.440
 The first is that it's thermoregulatory,

1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:02.520
 and what we found in some animal models

1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:07.420
 is that CBD will create a profile of hypothermia.

1:34:07.420 --> 1:34:09.040
 In other words, it cools the body,

1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:10.620
 the core body temperature down,

1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:12.940
 and that's something that we know is good for sleep.

1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:15.080
 The second is that it's an anxiolytic,

1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:16.840
 that it can reduce anxiety,

1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:19.400
 and that data is actually quite strong,

1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:21.260
 even with some functional imaging work

1:34:21.260 --> 1:34:22.600
 that's been coming out recently,

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.700
 showing that one epicenter of emotion

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:26.880
 called the amygdala deep within the brain

1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:30.240
 is quietened down with CBD.

1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:31.660
 So I think that's at least a second

1:34:31.660 --> 1:34:35.520
 non-mutually exclusive possibility.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.920
 I think the third is some recent data that's come out

1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:41.060
 that was suggesting that CBD

1:34:41.060 --> 1:34:43.960
 can alter the signaling of adenosine.

1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:45.360
 So it doesn't necessarily mean

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:48.320
 that you produce more adenosine,

1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:50.800
 but what it can do is perhaps modulate

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:53.600
 the sensitivity perhaps of the brain

1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:57.260
 so that the weight of that same adenosine

1:34:57.260 --> 1:35:02.160
 is weightier in its brain signal,

1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:06.220
 and therefore it creates this stronger pressure for sleep.

1:35:06.220 --> 1:35:09.040
 So I think these are all tentative mechanisms.

1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:10.700
 I think any one of them is viable.

1:35:10.700 --> 1:35:13.320
 I think all three are viable together,

1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:14.600
 but right now I think,

1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:16.040
 does that sort of help think through

1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:18.560
 the tapestry of THC and CBD?

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:19.540
 Yeah, very much so,

1:35:19.540 --> 1:35:22.140
 and actually it's a perfect segue from,

1:35:22.140 --> 1:35:27.140
 we've talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC,

1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:29.700
 and CBD as sort of,

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:30.920
 we framed them anyway,

1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:33.600
 as things that done in moderation at the appropriate times

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:36.120
 are probably okay for most people,

1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:37.140
 certainly not for everybody,

1:35:37.140 --> 1:35:39.000
 there will be differences in sensitivity,

1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.120
 but that done at the incorrect times

1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:44.520
 and certainly in the incorrect amounts

1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:48.120
 will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep.

1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:50.520
 CBD it seems represents a kind of bridge

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.560
 to the topic I'd like to talk about next,

1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:56.940
 which is things that promote more healthy sleep,

1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:00.680
 or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture

1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:02.220
 and quality of sleep.

1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:06.700
 So I'd love to chat for a moment about the kind of grant,

1:36:06.700 --> 1:36:09.280
 the original, I should say that not the granddaddy,

1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:13.600
 but the OG of sleep supplementation, which is melatonin,

1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.960
 the so-called hormone of darkness

1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:18.480
 that's inhibited by light, et cetera,

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:20.680
 frame for us melatonin

1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:23.560
 in the context of its naturally occurring form.

1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:25.840
 And then I'd like to talk about melatonin, the supplement,

1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:27.360
 because as in my experience,

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:28.760
 anytime I say the word melatonin,

1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:32.120
 people think about the supplement melatonin,

1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:35.780
 which in itself is an interesting phenomenon

1:36:35.780 --> 1:36:39.280
 that people are so cued to its role as something you take,

1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:40.760
 we often forget that this is something

1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:42.200
 that we make endogenously.

1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:44.460
 I'd love for you to comment in particular on,

1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:46.280
 even though we,

1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:48.760
 without necessarily getting into precise nanograms

1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:50.140
 per deciliter values,

1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:52.640
 what are the typical amounts of melatonin

1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:53.760
 that we release each night?

1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:56.640
 And then I'd like to compare that to what is contained

1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:59.440
 in say a three milligram or six milligram tablet

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:01.560
 that one might buy at the pharmacy.

1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:04.040
 So I go to sleep at night,

1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:05.680
 has melatonin already kicked in

1:37:05.680 --> 1:37:07.760
 before I shut my eyes and lay down my head?

1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:08.920
 Usually, yes.

1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:12.080
 If your system is working in the correct way,

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:14.400
 as dusk is starting to happen,

1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:17.280
 so let's say that you look at hunter gatherer tribes

1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:19.620
 who aren't touched by electricity.

1:37:19.620 --> 1:37:22.640
 And so that's sort of the puritanical state,

1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:26.740
 par excellence when it comes to electric light influence.

1:37:27.820 --> 1:37:30.580
 And usually it's as dusk is approaching,

1:37:30.580 --> 1:37:33.720
 that's when melatonin will start to rise.

1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:38.120
 And so when you lose the brake pedal of light

1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:39.920
 coming through the eyes,

1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:44.280
 not normally acts like a hard brake pedal that stamps down

1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:47.720
 and prevents the release and production of melatonin.

1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:52.400
 As that light brake pedal starts to fade with dusk,

1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:55.360
 then we ease off the brake pedal and melatonin,

1:37:55.360 --> 1:37:58.320
 the spigot of melatonin is opened up

1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:00.840
 and melatonin starts getting released.

1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:05.760
 And usually we'll see this rising peak of melatonin

1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.920
 sometime usually an hour, two hours later or around

1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:11.800
 and it varies from different people

1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:14.880
 around the time of sleep itself.

1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:18.400
 But it's already been on the march for some hours

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:22.640
 before you actually hit sleep itself.

1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:25.040
 Interesting, and I was always taught

1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:26.380
 and I'm assuming it's still true

1:38:26.380 --> 1:38:28.940
 that the only source of melatonin in the brain and body

1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:31.520
 is the pineal gland, is that still true?

1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.160
 Yeah, it seems to be from best that we can tell

1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:39.160
 and the pineal gland sort of meaning P like sort of shape.

1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:41.740
 It's actually, I think usually people say

1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:44.660
 it's P like, I think if you look at the Latin derivative,

1:38:44.660 --> 1:38:49.240
 it's more, I think it's derived from pine cone, not P.

1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:50.840
 Because in fact, if you look at the pineal,

1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:54.480
 it is more pine cone shaped and so it's aptly named.

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:56.280
 Any human brain I've ever dissected,

1:38:56.280 --> 1:38:57.440
 I confess I've dissected a lot

1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:00.600
 because I teach neuroanatomy and have for years.

1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:02.240
 I love looking at the pineal.

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:05.320
 It's the one structure in the brain that's not on both sides.

1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:08.080
 It's usually pretty easy to find and it's pretty good size.

1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:11.360
 It looks like a P and it's sitting right there

1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:15.200
 and it's remarkable that it releases this hormone,

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:18.560
 probably our entire lifespan and is inhibited by light.

1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:22.340
 So our pineal starts to release this

1:39:22.340 --> 1:39:23.480
 into the general circulation.

1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.080
 I have to imagine we have melatonin receptors

1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:26.280
 in the brain and body.

1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:27.120
 It's correct.

1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:29.520
 So yeah, essentially your brain

1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:32.320
 has a central master 24 hour clock

1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:37.320
 called the suprachiasmatic nucleus that keeps internal time.

1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:41.840
 Now it's not a precise clock if left to its own devices,

1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:44.480
 nothing that a Swiss clockmaker would be proud of.

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:47.120
 It runs a little bit long and laggy.

1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:48.160
 It's like an American clock.

1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:51.060
 So there are a couple of good American watches by the way.

1:39:51.060 --> 1:39:53.740
 Hamiltons are very nice, but we're not famous

1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:56.040
 for our timekeeping or our punctuality for them,

1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:57.560
 but the Swiss are.

1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:59.880
 It's very, it's not quite Swiss-like,

1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:02.120
 it's more Berkeley-like, which is very relaxed.

1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:03.600
 Oh, you know, whatever.

1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:07.440
 So in most adults, the average adult, I should say,

1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:10.280
 your biological clock normally runs a little bit long.

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:15.080
 It's about 24 hours and 13 minutes,

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:17.200
 I think was the last calculation.

1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:20.720
 But the reason that we don't keep drifting forward in time

1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:23.000
 and kind of running consistently, you know,

1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:24.640
 more and later and later,

1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:27.560
 30 minutes by 30 minutes by 30 minutes each day

1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:30.000
 is because your central brain clock

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.360
 is regulated by external things such as daylight

1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:36.440
 and temperature, as well as food and activity.

1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:39.820
 All of these are essentially different fingers

1:40:39.820 --> 1:40:43.680
 that come along and on the wristwatch of the 24 hour clock

1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:46.660
 will pull the dial out and reset it each day

1:40:46.660 --> 1:40:48.440
 to precisely 24 hours.

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:53.440
 And I make that point because it knows 24 hour time,

1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:57.680
 but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body

1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:00.520
 the 24 hour time as well.

1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:02.520
 And one of the ways that it does this

1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:07.520
 is by communicating a chemical signal of 24 hour nurse

1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:13.000
 of light and day using this hormone melatonin.

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:16.400
 And when it is at low levels or it's non-existent,

1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:19.080
 it's communicating the message, it's daytime.

1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:21.560
 And for us, diurnal species, it says,

1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:23.320
 it's time to be awake.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:25.880
 Yet at nighttime when dusk approaches

1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:27.560
 and the brake comes off melatonin

1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:28.960
 and we start to release it,

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.900
 then it signals to the rest of the brain and the body,

1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:34.040
 look, it's dusk and it's nighttime.

1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:38.220
 And for us, diurnal species, it's time to think about sleep.

1:41:38.220 --> 1:41:42.840
 So melatonin essentially tells the brain and the body

1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:44.320
 when it's day and when it's night.

1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:46.280
 And with that, when it's time to sleep,

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:47.720
 when it's time to wake.

1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:50.120
 And therefore that's why melatonin helps

1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:53.760
 with the timing of the onset of sleep,

1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:55.160
 but it doesn't really help

1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:56.880
 with the generation of sleep itself.

1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:58.680
 And this is why we'll come on to what those studies

1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:01.360
 of supplementation have taught us.

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.660
 So it tells the rest of my brain and body,

1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:05.280
 it's time to go to sleep.

1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:07.880
 Perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep,

1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:09.840
 but it's not going to, for instance,

1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:12.200
 ensure the overall structure of sleep

1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:16.440
 or it's not the conductor that's guiding the sleep orchestra

1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:18.180
 so to speak throughout the entire night.

1:42:18.180 --> 1:42:19.020
 Yeah, it's-

1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:22.740
 It's more like the people that essentially take you

1:42:22.740 --> 1:42:25.040
 to your seat and sit you down and give you your program.

1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:25.880
 Right, exactly.

1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:30.880
 Yeah, so the far less sophisticated analogy I have is,

1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:33.380
 you know, melatonin is like the starting official

1:42:33.380 --> 1:42:35.680
 at the 100 meter race in the Olympics.

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:36.520
 That's a better analogy.

1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.200
 It calls all of the sleep races to the line

1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:42.240
 and it begins the great sleep race.

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:43.720
 Yeah, better analogy by the way,

1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:46.520
 coming from the sleep researcher of all people.

1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:48.920
 But it doesn't participate in the race itself.

1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:51.440
 That's a whole different set of brain chemicals

1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:53.220
 and brain regions.

1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:57.800
 Which then brings us on to perhaps the question

1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:02.440
 of supplementation, which is,

1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:04.200
 is it helpful for my sleep?

1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:05.240
 Will I sleep longer?

1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:07.400
 Will I sleep better?

1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:12.360
 And if I am, what doses should I be taking?

1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:17.360
 Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults who are not older age

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:20.960
 suggests that melatonin is not really particularly helpful

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:22.040
 as a sleep aid.

1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:24.440
 I think there was a recent meta analysis

1:43:24.440 --> 1:43:28.080
 that demonstrated when it looked

1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:30.040
 at all of the different sleep parameters.

1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:32.560
 Melatonin and a meta analysis

1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:34.320
 for those not knowing what that is,

1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:36.160
 it's a scientific sort of method that we use

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:38.960
 where we gather all the individual studies

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:40.400
 and we put them in a big bucket

1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:43.040
 and we kind of do this kind of statistical fancy sleight

1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:45.280
 of hand and we try to come up with a big picture

1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:47.480
 of what all of those individual studies tell us.

1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:50.480
 And what that meta analysis told us is that melatonin

1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:55.480
 will only increase total amount of sleep by 3.9 minutes

1:43:55.620 --> 1:43:56.460
 on average.

1:43:56.460 --> 1:43:57.280
 Minutes?

1:43:57.280 --> 1:43:58.120
 Minutes.

1:43:58.120 --> 1:43:58.960
 Not even percent.

1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:03.960
 And it will only increase your sleep efficiency by 2.2%.

1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:05.520
 So it really-

1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:10.000
 This is as they say in certain parts of California,

1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:11.680
 that's weak sauce.

1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:13.480
 That's a weak sauce effect.

1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:14.760
 The sauce is not strong.

1:44:14.760 --> 1:44:16.900
 The force is not strong in this one.

1:44:16.900 --> 1:44:21.160
 When it comes to a tool that in healthy people

1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:24.200
 who are not of older age,

1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:26.440
 it doesn't seem to be especially beneficial.

1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:28.600
 Now, you know, results can vary.

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:29.920
 Everyone is different, of course.

1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:31.480
 So we're talking about the average,

1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:33.360
 the so-called average human adult here.

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.400
 Well, melatonin in defense of what you're saying,

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:37.280
 and also I should mention,

1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:39.760
 I have a colleague at Stanford, Jamie Zeitzer,

1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:42.240
 who we know comes from Chuck Zeitzer's lab at Harvard Med

1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:44.500
 where he also trained a terrific sleep researcher.

1:44:44.500 --> 1:44:45.840
 And I asked him about melatonin

1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:48.200
 and he essentially said the same thing that you just said,

1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:50.320
 which is very little, if any, evidence

1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:51.560
 that it can improve sleep.

1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:55.000
 And yet it's probably the most commonly consumed

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.480
 so-called sleep aid.

1:44:56.480 --> 1:44:58.120
 Hundreds of million dollars industry.

1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:00.960
 Yeah, so either massive placebo effect

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:03.200
 or it's operating through some other mechanism

1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:05.560
 related to quelling anxiety, perhaps.

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:07.400
 Yeah, that is actually interesting.

1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:08.700
 You know, there are some studies

1:45:08.700 --> 1:45:10.960
 where you do see some, you know, effects.

1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:13.180
 Now, again, when you do the grand average of all studies,

1:45:13.180 --> 1:45:14.840
 it just doesn't seem to have an effect.

1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:16.620
 But let's assume that for some people

1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:17.560
 it does have an effect.

1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:20.440
 Let's not, again, be sort of completely dismissive of that.

1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:22.000
 How could it have that effect?

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.480
 One of the reasons that I've become

1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:26.040
 a little bit more bullish on melatonin

1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:27.960
 from a sleep perspective,

1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:31.420
 and then melatonin more generally for a,

1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:32.900
 maybe we can speak about this too,

1:45:32.900 --> 1:45:37.440
 as a counter measure

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:39.860
 when you're undergoing insufficient sleep,

1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:43.080
 there are two different routes there.

1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:45.640
 The first reason that I think it could have a sleep benefit

1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:47.760
 for some people is not because it helps

1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:48.800
 in the generation of sleep.

1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:50.160
 We know that it doesn't.

1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:54.400
 It's because it too seems to drop core body temperature.

1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:55.520
 There it is temperature again.

1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:59.000
 I'm fascinated these days more and more by temperature

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:03.620
 as maybe not just a reflection of brain state

1:46:03.620 --> 1:46:05.460
 and wakefulness and in sleep,

1:46:05.460 --> 1:46:08.720
 but actually a lever that is quite powerful.

1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:11.560
 And with all the interest in ice baths and hot showers

1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:13.600
 and saunas and stuff, something that we will definitely

1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:17.320
 touch on, temperature variation is so key.

1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:20.200
 So if melatonin is dropping body temperature

1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:22.600
 by a degree or so, something that you've said before

1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:25.400
 can help induce a sleepy state,

1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:27.360
 maybe that's what's allowing people to get in to sleep.

1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:28.400
 I think that's one possibility.

1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:31.080
 I don't think melatonin by itself will drop it

1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:34.720
 by sort of a degree, certainly not a degree Celsius.

1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:37.240
 And for ordinary in us to fall asleep

1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:38.900
 and then stay asleep across the night,

1:46:38.900 --> 1:46:41.040
 we do need to drop our core body temperature

1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:42.820
 by about one degree Celsius

1:46:42.820 --> 1:46:45.940
 or about two to three degrees Fahrenheit.

1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:48.120
 And that's why it's always easier to fall asleep

1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:50.040
 in a room that's too cold than too hot.

1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:54.440
 I think that that's one potential avenue

1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.080
 that we are considering thinking more deeply about

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:00.160
 when it comes to melatonin.

1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:03.540
 And then the other is melatonin as an antioxidant,

1:47:03.540 --> 1:47:05.840
 but let me table that for now

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:07.800
 because I'll just get us sidetracked.

1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:11.520
 That's what we know so far about melatonin

1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:15.440
 in terms of its supplementation benefit or lack thereof.

1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:17.680
 Two final points that I shouldn't forget.

1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:21.000
 One is the only population where we typically see

1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:25.240
 some benefit and it often is prescribed is in older adults.

1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:26.080
 Because as we-

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:27.840
 Older meaning 60 and older?

1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:29.680
 Yeah, 60, 65 and older.

1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:31.120
 Because as we get older,

1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:33.860
 you can typically have what's called calcification

1:47:33.860 --> 1:47:36.300
 of the pineal gland, which means that that gland

1:47:36.300 --> 1:47:40.080
 that's releasing melatonin doesn't work as well anymore.

1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:44.720
 As a consequence, they tend to have a flatter overall curve

1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:47.020
 of melatonin released throughout the night.

1:47:47.020 --> 1:47:49.280
 It's not this beautiful, lovely peak

1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:52.000
 and this bullhorn message of it's darkness,

1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:53.360
 please get to sleep.

1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.920
 That's why older adults can have problems falling asleep

1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:56.960
 or staying asleep.

1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:00.360
 It's not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination,

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:01.540
 but it's one of the reasons

1:48:01.540 --> 1:48:04.640
 and it's why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts,

1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:07.840
 older adults, especially older adults with insomnia,

1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:09.680
 people have thought about that

1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:12.520
 as maybe an appropriate use case.

1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:15.720
 Well, on those lines, if we were to compare dosages,

1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:20.240
 do we know how much melatonin is typically released

1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:22.160
 into the bloodstream per night?

1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:26.440
 And can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb

1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:28.060
 by which to compare the typical amount

1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:29.320
 that someone would supplement?

1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:32.920
 I mean, typically the supplements for melatonin that I see

1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:35.100
 in the pharmacy and elsewhere and online

1:48:35.100 --> 1:48:38.200
 range anywhere from one milligram to 12

1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:40.360
 or even 20 milligrams.

1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:45.000
 My guess is that a normal night's release of melatonin,

1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.840
 typical for somebody in their 20s, 30s, 40s,

1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:51.520
 would be far lower than that, am I correct or wrong?

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.080
 Yeah, it's many magnitudes lower

1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:56.480
 and this is one of the problems is that I see that too.

1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:01.420
 I see typical doses are five milligrams or 10 milligrams

1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:04.600
 and of course, if you're a supplement company,

1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:06.720
 putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:07.960
 if that's what you're actually doing,

1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:09.920
 which we'll speak about purity as well,

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:14.800
 it's kind of like the super gulp size.

1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:17.000
 Nobody wants to lower price.

1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.120
 They just want you to,

1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:20.960
 we'll just give you more for the same price

1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:22.000
 and that's how we'll compete.

1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.080
 So it's been this escalating arms race

1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:26.980
 of melatonin concentration

1:49:26.980 --> 1:49:29.760
 and it really does not look meaningful

1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:32.980
 for sleep in any way.

1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:36.600
 What we've actually found is that the optimal doses

1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:38.720
 for where you do get sleep benefits

1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:41.200
 in the populations that we've looked at

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:46.200
 are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of melatonin.

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:51.320
 In other words, the typical doses are usually 10 times,

1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:55.520
 20 times, maybe more than what your body

1:49:55.520 --> 1:49:56.500
 would naturally expect

1:49:56.500 --> 1:50:00.480
 and this is what we call a supra physiological dose.

1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:02.320
 In other words, it's far above

1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:04.840
 what is physiologically normal.

1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:06.200
 And to put that in context,

1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:07.480
 imagine I said to you,

1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:11.200
 I want you to eat 20 times as much food today.

1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:13.960
 I thought you're going to use testosterone as example.

1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:15.520
 You're going to take 300 times

1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:16.720
 the normal amount of testosterone.

1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:20.440
 We know that would have tons of deleterious effects.

1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:22.680
 It'd be terrible and yet you can do this.

1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:24.240
 One thing that I'm concerned about

1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:27.240
 about these supra physiological levels of melatonin

1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:28.640
 is that many years ago,

1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:30.440
 actually here at Berkeley when I was a graduate student,

1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:33.360
 we would inject animals

1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:36.760
 which were seasonally breeding animals with melatonin.

1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:41.280
 And the consequence of that was that their gonads,

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:42.600
 either their testes or ovaries

1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:46.680
 would shrink many hundred fold or more.

1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:47.680
 In other words, they would go

1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:51.400
 from having nice healthy sized hamster testicles,

1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:54.280
 what a hamster would consider healthy size for a hamster,

1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:56.440
 and they would shrink to the size of a grain of rice.

1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:59.320
 So from like an almonds to a grain size of a grain of rice.

1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:01.880
 I had to see that only once for me to be very concerned

1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:04.420
 about super physiological levels of melatonin.

1:51:04.420 --> 1:51:06.760
 And I realized that melatonin does different things

1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:07.580
 in different species.

1:51:07.580 --> 1:51:10.920
 We are not hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders,

1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:12.440
 seasonally restricted breeders.

1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:14.140
 There might be more breeding during certain seasons.

1:51:14.140 --> 1:51:15.260
 I don't know those data,

1:51:15.260 --> 1:51:18.520
 but nonetheless, hormones are powerful.

1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:21.960
 And sure, there is an optimal,

1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:26.420
 and sometimes we see that going slightly above

1:51:26.420 --> 1:51:28.300
 endogenous levels for certain hormones,

1:51:28.300 --> 1:51:30.460
 not always can have beneficial effects.

1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:33.000
 And sometimes it can have detrimental effects.

1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:37.040
 I'm just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone

1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:40.060
 that has effects on the reproductive axis.

1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:42.820
 And that's one of the reasons why I get very concerned

1:51:42.820 --> 1:51:46.040
 when I see people really getting aggressive

1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:49.160
 about melatonin supplementation,

1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:53.280
 taking 110, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times

1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:54.560
 the amount that we would normally release.

1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:55.840
 That's my concern,

1:51:55.840 --> 1:51:58.800
 although it's not nested in any one specific human study.

1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:01.220
 I just don't like to see,

1:52:01.220 --> 1:52:02.920
 I certainly don't want to see other people

1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:06.180
 and I don't want to personally take a hormone

1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:10.640
 that's known to be androgen suppressive at high levels.

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:12.600
 Why would I take that?

1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:14.320
 That's the question I asked myself.

1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:16.320
 I think it's a very good point.

1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:19.720
 And if you look at some of the evidence

1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:23.160
 around melatonin's lethality,

1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:24.800
 if you want to go to that extreme,

1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:27.520
 for the most part, it's pretty safe.

1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:29.640
 You mean you can take a lot of it before you die.

1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:30.640
 Right, exactly.

1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:34.080
 Yeah, but that should not be your yardstick

1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:37.600
 because you really need to think about your health,

1:52:37.600 --> 1:52:40.280
 not just whether this thing is going to kill you or not

1:52:40.280 --> 1:52:44.580
 as the decision matrix through which you pop a pill.

1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:49.060
 And it comes on to this concern around melatonin

1:52:49.060 --> 1:52:50.560
 because there was a study,

1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:53.280
 I think it's one that you mentioned too,

1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:54.840
 where they looked at over,

1:52:54.840 --> 1:52:57.480
 I think it was at least over 20 different brands

1:52:57.480 --> 1:52:59.640
 of melatonin supplements.

1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:01.920
 And what they found is that based on what it said

1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:04.960
 on the bottle versus what was in the capsules themselves,

1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:08.440
 it ranged from, I think it was 83% less

1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:12.760
 than what it said on the bottle to 478% more

1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:14.260
 than what it said on the bottle.

1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:18.840
 Now, if that's a 10 milligram pill

1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:23.840
 and it's 478% more than 10 milligrams

1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:26.280
 and we're already at 10 milligrams

1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:30.720
 at many tens of times more than is a physiological

1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:34.080
 rather than a supra physiological dose,

1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:35.960
 we do need to be a bit thoughtful.

1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:38.560
 Yeah, remember those hamsters folks.

1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:43.200
 Well, and I do appreciate the deep dive on melatonin

1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:46.280
 because I think people need to understand

1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:48.560
 that it's nuanced, it's a matter of dosages

1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:50.020
 and timing, et cetera.

1:53:50.020 --> 1:53:51.200
 And then it may have its place,

1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:53.760
 as you mentioned in older individuals.

1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:56.720
 And I should mention that I'm an avid consumer

1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:59.560
 of supplements that I believe in for me.

1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:00.900
 And I have been for a very long time.

1:54:00.900 --> 1:54:04.340
 So I'm by no means anti supplement.

1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:07.200
 Some supplements I refuse to take or avoid taking,

1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:09.860
 others I am quite avidly take.

1:54:09.860 --> 1:54:13.660
 And along those lines, I personally,

1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:17.600
 and I don't know what your thoughts on this are,

1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:19.120
 but there are a few things

1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:20.520
 that I've personally found beneficial.

1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:21.600
 I'd love your thoughts on them.

1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:23.680
 And I would love it if you would tell me

1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:26.560
 that everything I'm about to refer to as placebo,

1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:27.400
 that would be fine.

1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:28.680
 So that's what we do.

1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:29.840
 We're scientists, we argue,

1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:33.920
 and then we remain friends as it goes.

1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:37.000
 So magnesium.

1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.320
 There are many forms of magnesium.

1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:41.840
 Magnesium citrate is, as we know, is a terrific laxative.

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:45.600
 Magnesium malate seems, at least from a few studies,

1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:48.160
 seems to relieve some of delayed onset muscle soreness,

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.960
 doesn't seem to create a kind of sedation.

1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:51.720
 Two forms of magnesium that I'm aware of,

1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:55.160
 magnesium biglycinate and magnesium threonate.

1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:56.620
 Yeah.

1:54:56.620 --> 1:54:58.620
 We believe, based on the data,

1:54:58.620 --> 1:55:01.560
 can more actively cross the blood-brain barrier.

1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:02.480
 So you put it in your gut,

1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:03.840
 but some of that needs to get into your brain

1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:05.600
 in order to have the sedative effect.

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:08.140
 What are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation?

1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:10.560
 Do you supplement with magnesium?

1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:14.540
 And what studies would you like to see done

1:55:14.540 --> 1:55:16.160
 if they haven't been done already?

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:19.240
 So I don't supplement with magnesium,

1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:21.800
 but I do think threonate is interesting

1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:24.480
 because of that higher capacity

1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:26.080
 to cross the blood-brain barrier

1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:28.520
 and actually have a central nervous system effect.

1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:30.160
 And the reason that that interests me

1:55:30.160 --> 1:55:33.880
 is because the sleep is by the brain, of the brain,

1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.840
 and also for the brain, as well as for the body.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:40.840
 We just don't have a particularly good set of studies

1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:43.800
 that have targeted exclusively threonate.

1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:45.840
 We do have lots of studies that have just looked

1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:48.240
 at magnesium in general for sleep.

1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:51.880
 And overall, the data is uncompelling.

1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:52.720
 Interesting.

1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:57.440
 And for a while, I was confused as to why.

1:55:57.440 --> 1:55:59.080
 Where did this come from?

1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:01.900
 This kind of myth of magnesium.

1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:04.320
 So I started looking back into the literature

1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:08.880
 and I've best traced it, at least as far as I can tell,

1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:12.440
 to early studies showing that those who were deficient

1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:15.800
 in magnesium also had sleep problems.

1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:17.920
 They had other problems too, of course,

1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:21.200
 but sleep problems were one of that set of sequelae

1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:24.260
 that came from having lower magnesium.

1:56:24.260 --> 1:56:28.120
 And when they supplemented with magnesium

1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:29.780
 and tried to restore those levels,

1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:32.320
 some of those sleep problems dissipated.

1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:35.640
 And then that seems to have gotten lost in sort of

1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:38.480
 some game of sort of like whispers around the room.

1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:40.920
 And it's become translated into people

1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:42.720
 who don't have sleep problems,

1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:45.360
 who are healthy sleepers and who are healthy in general,

1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:47.920
 and who have healthy normal levels of magnesium.

1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:51.600
 If they take more magnesium, they will sleep better.

1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:53.740
 And the data really there is not good.

1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:56.980
 Once again, the only study that I've seen

1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:59.240
 where magnesium did have some efficacy

1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:00.880
 was in a study with older adults.

1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:03.000
 I think they were 60 to 80 years old.

1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.480
 It may have been exclusively women now I think about it.

1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:08.400
 And they also had insomnia.

1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:11.680
 And in that population, you did see some benefits.

1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:15.360
 And my guess is that because it's an older community

1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:18.440
 as well, they were probably deficient in magnesium.

1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:21.660
 So they fit the former category of simply

1:57:21.660 --> 1:57:23.840
 when you're deficient and you restore,

1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:27.460
 you can help sleep sort of return to normal.

1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:29.640
 But if you are not deficient and you're healthy

1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:31.480
 and you're not old and you don't have insomnia,

1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:34.920
 and you're supplementing thinking that it provides sleep,

1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:37.600
 right now, the data isn't supportive of that.

1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:39.960
 But I just don't think we have enough threonate data

1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:41.140
 to actually speak about that

1:57:41.140 --> 1:57:44.200
 because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue so far

1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:45.500
 with the other forms.

1:57:45.500 --> 1:57:47.960
 So maybe some additional studies looking specifically

1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:51.040
 at threonate or biglycinate would be useful.

1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:54.000
 Magnesium is involved in so many cellular processes.

1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:57.080
 You can imagine that this effect, if it truly exists,

1:57:57.080 --> 1:57:59.160
 is, as we say in science, in the noise,

1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:02.360
 meaning it's in the jitter of the data.

1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:03.920
 But to isolate the real effect,

1:58:03.920 --> 1:58:06.200
 one needs to do some more refined studies.

1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:11.160
 What are some things that are of interest to you,

1:58:11.160 --> 1:58:13.340
 if not things that you happen to take?

1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:16.620
 These are not things that I personally take,

1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:19.880
 mostly because I just haven't experimented with them.

1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:22.640
 Valerian root is one.

1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:27.100
 Tart cherry and kiwi fruit.

1:58:27.100 --> 1:58:30.960
 Tell me about Valerian root, tart cherry, and kiwi fruit.

1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:32.560
 This is new to me.

1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:34.300
 I mean, I've certainly heard of them,

1:58:34.300 --> 1:58:38.020
 and tart cherry and kiwi sounds delicious.

1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:41.320
 But what's happening with Valerian root,

1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:42.920
 tart cherry, and kiwi,

1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:45.840
 and are we talking about eating tart cherries and kiwis

1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:47.480
 and Valerian roots?

1:58:47.480 --> 1:58:49.140
 Or are we talking about taking them in pill form?

1:58:49.140 --> 1:58:50.500
 Usually it's supplements,

1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:54.880
 but it's also both for tart cherries and for kiwis.

1:58:54.880 --> 1:58:58.120
 It's the actual fruit themselves.

1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:02.380
 Valerian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid,

1:59:02.380 --> 1:59:04.940
 and lots of people swear by it too.

1:59:04.940 --> 1:59:08.120
 But the evidence is actually quite against that.

1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:09.920
 Not that it makes your sleep worse,

1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:13.360
 but of at least the seven good studies

1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:14.560
 that I've been able to find.

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:17.000
 And typically these are of the nature

1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:21.260
 of what we call a randomized placebo crossover design.

1:59:21.260 --> 1:59:23.620
 And I won't bore people with what that means.

1:59:23.620 --> 1:59:24.460
 It's sort of one of the-

1:59:24.460 --> 1:59:25.360
 Good studies, solid studies.

1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:27.680
 Yeah, it's one of the sort of gold standard methods

1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:29.540
 that we have when we're looking at intervention studies,

1:59:29.540 --> 1:59:30.880
 such as drug studies.

1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:33.860
 Five of the seven found no benefit

1:59:33.860 --> 1:59:36.140
 of Valerian root on sleep.

1:59:36.140 --> 1:59:37.960
 Then two out of the seven,

1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:40.680
 the data was just insufficient.

1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:42.080
 I think it was a power issue

1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:45.280
 where they just couldn't make any strong conclusions.

1:59:45.280 --> 1:59:49.040
 And then I think there was the most recent study,

1:59:51.320 --> 1:59:56.320
 I think looked at two different doses of Valerian.

1:59:56.880 --> 1:59:58.420
 I could have this wrong,

1:59:58.420 --> 2:00:01.680
 and they just failed to find any effects once again.

2:00:01.680 --> 2:00:03.800
 But the stunning part of that paper,

2:00:03.800 --> 2:00:05.800
 as I recall, they had this big table

2:00:05.800 --> 2:00:08.400
 with all of the different sleep metrics that they looked at.

2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:10.800
 And there were well over 25 different things

2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:14.240
 that they tried to see if Valerian impacted.

2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:16.300
 And none of them were significant,

2:00:16.300 --> 2:00:19.280
 which stuns me because from statistical probabilities,

2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:23.520
 we know if you just randomly perform 25 statistical tests,

2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:25.220
 chances are probabilistically,

2:00:25.220 --> 2:00:28.960
 you'll just get one significant result by random chance.

2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:32.360
 And even with random chance on their side,

2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:36.160
 they still couldn't find a benefit of Valerian.

2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:38.880
 So Valerian root might be worse than nothing at all

2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:41.080
 if there is, so to speak.

2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:43.040
 I mean, again, placebo effect,

2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:44.600
 we can think about that too.

2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:45.960
 And I would say that if you feel

2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:48.180
 as though it's having a benefit for you,

2:00:48.180 --> 2:00:51.360
 and with all of the caveats that we have with supplements,

2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:54.920
 things like melatonin, purity, concentration, et cetera,

2:00:54.920 --> 2:00:56.640
 maybe it's no harm, no foul,

2:00:56.640 --> 2:00:59.000
 but I'm not a medical doctor,

2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.100
 and I don't tell anyone about,

2:01:01.100 --> 2:01:03.160
 we have all of these disclaimers about not recommending.

2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:04.480
 Sure, and we'll include these.

2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:06.400
 I mean, I always say, we're not physicians,

2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:07.360
 we don't prescribe anything.

2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:10.000
 We're scientists and professors, so we profess things.

2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.620
 And it's up to people to be responsible for their own health,

2:01:13.620 --> 2:01:16.180
 not just to protect us, but to protect themselves.

2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:21.780
 I do want to hear about tart cherry and kiwi fruit.

2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:24.360
 What's the story there?

2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:25.200
 Strange, isn't it?

2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:30.140
 I was, you know, I'm kind of a hard-nosed scientist.

2:01:30.140 --> 2:01:32.820
 And when people, you know, some years ago started saying,

2:01:32.820 --> 2:01:35.560
 oh, tart cherries, it's the thing, or kiwi fruits,

2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:38.120
 I was thinking, oh my goodness, this sounds a bit-

2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:39.200
 You've been in California a little too long.

2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:42.200
 Yeah, I know, yeah, the sun has softened me.

2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:44.440
 But I thought, look, one of the things

2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:46.440
 that we have to do as scientists

2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:49.080
 is be as open-minded as possible,

2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:51.320
 and I should not be so quick to dismiss.

2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:53.120
 So I went to the literature,

2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:56.100
 just started reading as much as I could about it.

2:01:56.100 --> 2:01:59.440
 And there were three really good randomized

2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:03.000
 placebo crossover trials with tart cherries.

2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:06.040
 And what they found was that in one study,

2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:10.760
 it reduced the amount of time that you spent awake at night

2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:12.840
 by over an hour.

2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:14.520
 And then the other two studies,

2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:17.680
 one of them found that it increased the amount of sleep

2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:19.840
 that you got by 34 minutes.

2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:21.820
 The other, it increased the amount of sleep

2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:24.880
 that you got by 84 minutes.

2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:26.600
 Which, you know, these are,

2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:30.160
 and what's striking is that they were independent studies,

2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:33.000
 I think, meaning that they were from independent groups.

2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.440
 And these were, you know, some of these guys,

2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:38.760
 you know, girls, I know pretty well.

2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:39.600
 And they're really-

2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:40.440
 You know and trust their work.

2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:41.960
 Right, I really trust their work too.

2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:43.620
 Were they ingesting actual tart cherries

2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:45.320
 or they're drinking the juice or in capsule?

2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:46.240
 It was juice.

2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:49.360
 So they, in all three studies, it was juice.

2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:51.260
 Although you can, I think as a supplement,

2:02:51.260 --> 2:02:53.440
 you can buy it in a capsule and we've got no idea

2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:56.360
 whether that changes the benefit or not.

2:02:56.360 --> 2:02:57.700
 What was also interesting in,

2:02:57.700 --> 2:02:58.880
 I think it was that last study

2:02:58.880 --> 2:03:02.340
 where they got an increase in sleep by 84 minutes.

2:03:02.340 --> 2:03:06.360
 It also decreased daytime napping significantly.

2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:08.800
 Oh, that's one that I could certainly make use of.

2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:11.480
 I love my daytime naps, but I'd love to skip them too.

2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:13.360
 Right, and we can speak about naps

2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:15.980
 and sort of the upside and downside of that.

2:03:15.980 --> 2:03:18.640
 Which then made me think, well, if that's the case,

2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:23.360
 maybe the net benefit on sleep overall is no different.

2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:25.360
 It's just that it decreases the amount of time

2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:27.980
 that some people were taking to sleep during the day

2:03:27.980 --> 2:03:29.600
 and giving it back to the night.

2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:30.440
 But that wasn't the case

2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:32.880
 because if you added the total amount of sleep

2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:34.600
 that they were getting without tart cherries,

2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:37.200
 both naps and nightly sleep combined,

2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:39.360
 still when you took tart cherries,

2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:42.900
 you still got a net sum benefit of total amount of sleep.

2:03:42.900 --> 2:03:47.900
 So, you know, so far when it comes to supplements

2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:51.860
 and those types of studies, they're good studies

2:03:51.860 --> 2:03:53.400
 and the data looks interesting.

2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:57.320
 But as a drug itself, you know, if this was clinical drug,

2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:00.480
 you know, three studies that are somewhat small in nature

2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:02.000
 and have some positive benefit,

2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.480
 that's what we would call preliminary data

2:04:04.480 --> 2:04:07.560
 of maybe a chin scratching kind.

2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:08.400
 So keep this in context.

2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:10.100
 Yeah, and depending on the margins for safety,

2:04:10.100 --> 2:04:13.260
 one might think, well, given that it's a tart cherry

2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:16.160
 as opposed to some pharmaceutical you need a prescription for

2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:18.860
 then, you know, some people their threshold

2:04:18.860 --> 2:04:21.080
 to experiment with supplements is quite low,

2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:23.100
 some people their threshold is quite high.

2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:25.880
 I feel like, you know, there are two categories

2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:27.960
 or at least two categories of folks out there.

2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:31.120
 People who hear, oh, tart cherry can improve sleep

2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:32.680
 and will run out and try it.

2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:35.160
 And people who hear, well, that sounds crazy,

2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:36.220
 why would I do that?

2:04:37.460 --> 2:04:39.000
 But of course we have to remind people

2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.840
 that tart cherry isn't really what we're talking about,

2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:43.640
 presumably, if this is a real effect

2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:45.320
 and it sounds like it might be,

2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:47.680
 that there's a compound in tart cherry

2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:50.160
 that if we were to call it whatever, whatever,

2:04:50.160 --> 2:04:53.380
 five, alpha, six, you know, some molecule,

2:04:53.380 --> 2:04:55.580
 if we refer to it by its technical name,

2:04:55.580 --> 2:04:57.640
 then people would say, oh, that sounds like

2:04:57.640 --> 2:05:00.080
 a very interesting technical way to approach sleep,

2:05:00.080 --> 2:05:01.240
 but doesn't sound very natural.

2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:04.440
 So both groups are a little bit misguided

2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:06.240
 in the sense that people who think that everything

2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:08.680
 that comes from naturally occurring foods, plants, et cetera,

2:05:08.680 --> 2:05:09.820
 things that grow out of the ground,

2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:12.200
 that that's all safe, that's not true.

2:05:12.200 --> 2:05:15.640
 And people that think that pharmaceuticals are the only,

2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:18.780
 if it's not evidence with the purified molecule,

2:05:18.780 --> 2:05:20.680
 then something's not of utility.

2:05:20.680 --> 2:05:21.720
 Well, that's certainly not true.

2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:23.600
 Somewhere in the middle, I think lies the answer,

2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:25.840
 which is, it sounds to me like tart cherry

2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:29.700
 is at least an intriguing potential sleep aid,

2:05:29.700 --> 2:05:31.640
 intriguing potential sleep aid,

2:05:31.640 --> 2:05:34.200
 and I'm underscoring potential.

2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:35.880
 I'm certainly intrigued by it to the point

2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:37.280
 where I might experiment a bit,

2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:39.780
 but I'm an experimenter for myself.

2:05:39.780 --> 2:05:42.120
 Before I ask you about kiwi,

2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:44.840
 I've had quite good results

2:05:44.840 --> 2:05:46.560
 from taking something called apigenin,

2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:48.520
 which is a derivative of chamomile,

2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:51.520
 but in supplement form, I think I take 50 milligrams

2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:53.600
 about 30 minutes before sleep,

2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:58.600
 and I subjectively experience a better night's sleep,

2:05:59.140 --> 2:05:59.980
 so to speak.

2:05:59.980 --> 2:06:02.040
 I don't measure, I confess I don't measure my sleep.

2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:03.600
 I'm not a sleep tracker guy.

2:06:05.160 --> 2:06:08.100
 But there are a few papers out there.

2:06:08.100 --> 2:06:09.800
 They're not what we would call

2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:11.400
 published in blue ribbon journals,

2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:13.920
 but they have control groups

2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:15.400
 and it looks somewhat interesting.

2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:18.080
 And there, when I say apigenin,

2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:19.320
 people get somewhat intrigued,

2:06:19.320 --> 2:06:22.780
 oh, this molecule, chamomile, has long been thought

2:06:22.780 --> 2:06:26.260
 to be a sedative, a mild sedative, but a sedative.

2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:27.440
 Do you drink chamomile tea?

2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:28.800
 Do you take apigenin?

2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:29.960
 What are your thoughts on apigenin?

2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:33.520
 Yeah, I don't, and I have looked into some of the data

2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:35.360
 regarding sleep as well.

2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:37.000
 Right now, from best I can tell,

2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.120
 it's mostly subjective data

2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:42.280
 rather than objective, hard sort of sleep measures.

2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:46.520
 And that's why right now, it's sort of unclear,

2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:49.600
 not no comment, but just unclear,

2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:52.320
 not dismissing it because I think you and I

2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:55.240
 both ascribe to the idea of absence of evidence

2:06:55.240 --> 2:06:57.000
 is not evidence of absence.

2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:00.320
 So keep your mind open, at least I tell that to myself.

2:07:02.280 --> 2:07:04.320
 I think if you're finding a benefit

2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:06.700
 and you can do what I would think of

2:07:06.700 --> 2:07:08.500
 if I was personally experimenting,

2:07:08.500 --> 2:07:11.280
 which is both the positive and negative

2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:13.660
 parts of the experiment, what I mean by that is,

2:07:13.660 --> 2:07:16.440
 let's say that I now want to think about

2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:18.680
 some kind of a sleep supplement.

2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:21.880
 I will take some kind of baseline set of recordings

2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:26.520
 for a month and I will just gauge where I'm at,

2:07:26.520 --> 2:07:28.240
 sort of supplement free.

2:07:28.240 --> 2:07:30.360
 Then I'll go on for a month

2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:32.440
 to whatever I'm thinking of taking.

2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:35.660
 And I don't supplement, but let's say that I want to

2:07:35.660 --> 2:07:37.480
 and I experiment with that.

2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:39.940
 And I feel as though based on my metrics,

2:07:39.940 --> 2:07:41.840
 be them objective from my aura ring

2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:45.160
 or be them subjective from whatever I'm writing down

2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:47.460
 in the morning and both are important and valid,

2:07:47.460 --> 2:07:49.160
 subjective and objective.

2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:50.760
 We like both in the sleep world.

2:07:51.880 --> 2:07:54.280
 And I think, okay, look, it's clearly that

2:07:54.280 --> 2:07:56.980
 it seems to have some kind of an effect.

2:07:56.980 --> 2:08:00.320
 The key thing, however, is then do the negative experiment,

2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:04.000
 which is now come off it for another month

2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.280
 and see do things get worse?

2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:09.260
 And if I can see that by directionality,

2:08:09.260 --> 2:08:13.000
 then I'm starting to think maybe I'm believing this

2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:14.100
 a little bit more.

2:08:14.100 --> 2:08:17.400
 So that's the way I would sort of typically approach

2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:20.240
 a supplementation regimen if I were to do it.

2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:23.020
 And that's just me, that's just the way my mind works, but.

2:08:23.020 --> 2:08:23.860
 No, that's great.

2:08:23.860 --> 2:08:26.240
 I think it's very scientific and organized

2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:29.600
 in a way that allows you and would allow other people

2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:32.940
 to make very informed decisions for themselves.

2:08:32.940 --> 2:08:33.780
 I like that.

2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:37.740
 I like to think in terms of manipulating

2:08:37.740 --> 2:08:39.680
 any aspect of our biology,

2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:43.920
 that behavioral tools always are the first line of entry.

2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:46.680
 Then nutrition, everyone has to eat sooner or later,

2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:48.300
 even if you're fasting.

2:08:48.300 --> 2:08:52.280
 Then perhaps supplementation, then prescription drugs,

2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:54.320
 and then perhaps brain machine interface,

2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:56.560
 devices that you use to induce something.

2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:57.960
 And those could be done in combination.

2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:01.280
 But what concerns me is when I hear people say,

2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:03.720
 well, what should I take without thinking

2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:06.140
 about their behavior, their light viewing behavior, et cetera.

2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:08.840
 But of course these things work in combination.

2:09:08.840 --> 2:09:11.300
 I think it's, you're right that there's many,

2:09:11.300 --> 2:09:14.840
 when it comes to sleep, there are many low hanging fruits

2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:18.720
 that don't necessarily require you to, you know,

2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:21.600
 put sort of exogenous molecules, in other words,

2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:23.620
 things like supplements into your body,

2:09:23.620 --> 2:09:26.480
 or, you know, use different types of drugs

2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:28.080
 to help you get there.

2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:31.360
 Now, when it comes to prescription sleep aids,

2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:34.860
 I think I've been, again, a little bit too forthright.

2:09:34.860 --> 2:09:38.340
 We know in clinical practice that there may be a time

2:09:38.340 --> 2:09:40.600
 and a place for things like sleeping pills.

2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:45.600
 They are a short term solution to certain forms of insomnia,

2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:49.680
 but they are not recommended for the longterm.

2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:51.440
 And we also know that there are lots of other ways

2:09:51.440 --> 2:09:55.340
 that you can get a sleep help,

2:09:55.340 --> 2:09:58.040
 or you can get a sleep curative profile

2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:00.760
 from things like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia,

2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:02.640
 which is a non-drug approach, psychological one.

2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:05.120
 And quite effective from what I understand, good data.

2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:07.140
 Just as effective as sleeping pills, great data,

2:10:07.140 --> 2:10:08.700
 more effective in the longterm.

2:10:08.700 --> 2:10:10.520
 There was a recent study published that

2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:11.880
 after working with that therapist,

2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:15.480
 some of the benefits lasted almost a decade, you know.

2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:17.400
 Now, if you stop sleeping pills,

2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:20.600
 usually you have rebound insomnia where your sleep goes back

2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:23.200
 to being just as bad, if not worse.

2:10:23.200 --> 2:10:24.400
 And I think the same is true

2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:25.800
 when we think about supplementation.

2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:29.560
 There are so many things that are easy to implement

2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:33.540
 when it comes to sleep that don't require venturing out

2:10:33.540 --> 2:10:34.380
 into those waters.

2:10:34.380 --> 2:10:36.860
 And again, we're not here to tell anyone

2:10:36.860 --> 2:10:38.440
 about whether they should venture or not.

2:10:38.440 --> 2:10:40.040
 That's completely your choice.

2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:41.880
 All I'm saying is that if you want to think

2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:43.660
 about optimizing your sleep,

2:10:43.660 --> 2:10:45.840
 there are a number of ways that you can do it

2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:49.360
 that don't necessarily require you to swallow anything

2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:52.760
 or inject anything, or smoke anything, or free base.

2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:55.960
 And for which the margins of safety are quite wide.

2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:56.960
 That's the other one.

2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:57.800
 Yeah, sorry, thank you for that.

2:10:57.800 --> 2:10:59.040
 So speaking of low hanging fruit,

2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:01.080
 I don't know how low it hangs in reality,

2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:02.620
 but what about kiwi?

2:11:02.620 --> 2:11:04.260
 They're delicious to me anyway.

2:11:04.260 --> 2:11:06.080
 Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit.

2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:09.400
 Named not, shouldn't be mistaken

2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:13.400
 for the flightless bird of New Zealand,

2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:14.800
 which is the native bird there.

2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:16.700
 We're talking about the kiwi, the fruit here,

2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:21.700
 which those trees and shrubs are mostly Southeast Asia.

2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.520
 Kiwi fruits have been previously touted

2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:28.880
 as potentially having a sleep benefit,

2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:30.120
 which again got me curious,

2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:32.800
 and I at first threw it out.

2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:35.220
 To my knowledge, there's really only one

2:11:35.220 --> 2:11:38.280
 published human study that's of any value.

2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:41.400
 But what they did find was that it decreased

2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:43.760
 the speed of time with which it took you to fall asleep.

2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:45.480
 These are people ingesting the whole kiwi?

2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:46.840
 So it's ingesting the whole kiwi.

2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:48.440
 With the skin, I eat the skin,

2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:49.600
 people cringe when they see me do it.

2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:51.360
 Well, I think, no, no, no,

2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:53.720
 I think the idea is some of the good stuff,

2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:54.680
 and I'll come on to this,

2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:57.080
 may actually be in the skin itself.

2:11:57.080 --> 2:12:00.000
 Thank you, you just helped me win a bet.

2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:00.840
 I'll give you your-

2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:02.400
 Okay, okay, yeah, you can pay me later.

2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:04.120
 By the way, this skin is used, no, no, no,

2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:07.760
 he just told me to say that, so he went, no, he did not.

2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:09.520
 So the skin seems to be part

2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:12.160
 of this potential sleep equation.

2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:16.460
 And that's the, yeah, you fell asleep faster,

2:12:16.460 --> 2:12:19.000
 and you stayed asleep for longer,

2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:22.100
 and you spent less time awake throughout the night.

2:12:22.100 --> 2:12:24.320
 And I just thought, well, that's one study,

2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:26.340
 what can you really do with that?

2:12:26.340 --> 2:12:29.940
 There was another study, however, in an animal model,

2:12:29.940 --> 2:12:33.400
 which is a little bit more interesting.

2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:36.600
 And once again, they found a very similar phenotype

2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:39.140
 that the rats, oh, sorry, they were mice.

2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:41.480
 The mice fell asleep faster,

2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:44.880
 and they also spent longer time in sleep.

2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:47.120
 The sleep duration also increased.

2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:49.280
 What was also interesting mechanistically,

2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:52.760
 and this is not the mechanism that I think ties together

2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:57.760
 tart cherries, kiwi fruit, and things like melatonin,

2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:02.240
 because I think there could be one common binding mechanism.

2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:03.800
 What they found in the animal study

2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:08.360
 is that they could block those kiwi fruit sleep benefits

2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:11.360
 using a GABA blocking agent.

2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:16.360
 Now, GABA, which stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid,

2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:19.720
 is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters

2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:20.560
 of the brain.

2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:21.400
 It's kind of like the red-

2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:26.400
 It's kind of like the red light on the traffic light signal.

2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:32.040
 Others are green light, GABA is red light.

2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:35.800
 So by playing around with some sort of clever drugs

2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:37.320
 to manipulate the system,

2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:40.200
 they could prevent the benefit of the kiwi fruit

2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:43.360
 by sort of buggering around with the GABA receptor,

2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:48.200
 meaning that perhaps part of the kiwi fruit benefit on sleep

2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:52.640
 was mediated by the brain's natural inhibitory

2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:55.400
 neurotransmitter system called the GABA system.

2:13:55.400 --> 2:13:58.520
 And I thought that convinced me a little bit more

2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:01.240
 that maybe there's something here to read into.

2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:06.140
 So to be determined, again, here is the banner,

2:14:06.140 --> 2:14:10.440
 but tart cherries and kiwi fruits, the data surprised me,

2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:15.440
 because in part, I was so preoccupied with being,

2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:20.380
 I don't know, a bit purish about it and a bit snobby,

2:14:20.380 --> 2:14:21.800
 thinking, oh, come on,

2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:24.120
 that's definitely not going to work well.

2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:25.320
 The data's so far.

2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:26.980
 I look forward to a day when supplements

2:14:26.980 --> 2:14:28.300
 are no longer called supplements,

2:14:28.300 --> 2:14:29.220
 because at the end of the day,

2:14:29.220 --> 2:14:30.940
 whether or not something has an effect,

2:14:30.940 --> 2:14:32.280
 whether or not it's a whole kiwi fruit

2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:33.840
 or a derivative kiwi fruit,

2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:35.500
 will depend on the molecular compound.

2:14:35.500 --> 2:14:36.480
 And as you mentioned,

2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:40.180
 this potential mechanism via the GABA system,

2:14:41.180 --> 2:14:44.400
 that's, we both as scientists get excited about mechanism,

2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:46.520
 because when you can trace a mechanism and a pathway,

2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:47.680
 it provides a rationale,

2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:50.400
 a grounding for why kiwi of all things

2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:51.920
 or tart cherry of all things

2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:55.020
 might help increase total sleep time.

2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:58.360
 I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:01.680
 or ask about tryptophan and serotonin.

2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:05.920
 I can anecdotally say when I've taken tryptophan,

2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:10.320
 the precursor to serotonin or serotonin itself,

2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:12.640
 I have a horrendous night's sleep.

2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:14.680
 I fall asleep very easily

2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:19.520
 and I experience ridiculously vivid dreams,

2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:22.240
 neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it's kind of a mishmash.

2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:23.440
 And then I wake up

2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:27.400
 and I experienced several days of insomnia that,

2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:30.420
 and I've done the positive control and the negative control

2:15:30.420 --> 2:15:32.340
 and all the variations thereof,

2:15:32.340 --> 2:15:34.640
 to confirm that at least for me,

2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.080
 supplementing with serotonergic agents

2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:40.560
 is a bad idea for me.

2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.680
 And tryptophan is a common sleep supplement

2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:46.640
 and sleep aid that's discussed.

2:15:48.340 --> 2:15:50.160
 The normal architecture of sleep

2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:52.080
 involves the release of serotonin,

2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:54.040
 but in a very timed and regulated way.

2:15:54.040 --> 2:15:56.560
 What are your thoughts about serotonin in sleep,

2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:59.120
 if you had to kind of put that into a nutshell,

2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.520
 and then why supplementing with serotonin

2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:05.980
 and or its precursor, tryptophan,

2:16:05.980 --> 2:16:08.640
 might be a good or a bad idea for somebody?

2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:13.640
 Well, I think one of the potential dangers

2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:18.220
 is that based on what's going on in your body,

2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:20.400
 that can change the absorption

2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:24.160
 of natural sort of tryptophan and serotonin uptake

2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:26.180
 within the brain itself.

2:16:26.180 --> 2:16:29.640
 So I'm always thoughtful when you're playing around

2:16:29.640 --> 2:16:32.820
 with that mother nature dynamic, as it were.

2:16:32.820 --> 2:16:34.240
 The data, as you described,

2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:35.820
 is a little bit all over the map.

2:16:35.820 --> 2:16:37.720
 Some people say that it knocks them out.

2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:39.760
 Other people say, just like you do,

2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:42.280
 it has a terrible impact on my sleep.

2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:46.440
 And when I stop, it's pretty bad for a couple of days.

2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:49.580
 It seems to have this lingering after effect.

2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:54.560
 I think what could be happening here is

2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:57.280
 we need serotonin to, just as you described,

2:16:57.280 --> 2:16:59.540
 be modulated in very specific ways

2:16:59.540 --> 2:17:01.220
 during the different stages of sleep.

2:17:01.220 --> 2:17:05.880
 If you look at the firing of the brain epicenters

2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:07.960
 where serotonin is released,

2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:10.280
 and there's a bunch of them in the brainstem,

2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:15.240
 what you find on the release of serotonin too,

2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:18.200
 when we're awake, it's usually in high concentrations.

2:17:18.200 --> 2:17:20.440
 As we start to drift off to sleep,

2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:23.800
 it lowers some, but not necessarily dramatically

2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:26.520
 as we're going into non-REM sleep.

2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:31.520
 But then when we go into REM sleep, serotonin is shut off.

2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:35.540
 One of the other neuromodulators, noradrenaline,

2:17:35.540 --> 2:17:37.360
 also shut off.

2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:41.340
 REM sleep is the only time during the 24-hour period

2:17:41.340 --> 2:17:43.960
 where we see noradrenaline and serotonin,

2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:46.800
 or norepinephrine, completely shut down.

2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:49.640
 When I say serotonin, we're also talking 5-HTP,

2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:52.640
 sorry, 5-HT, that's just its chemical name here.

2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:56.120
 So whether it, speaking about serotonin or 5-HT,

2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:58.320
 it's the same thing, norepinephrine, noradrenaline,

2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:00.840
 both of those need to be shut down

2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:03.200
 for you to produce REM sleep.

2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:05.460
 The other, one of the other neuromodulators

2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:09.660
 that then ramps up to produce REM sleep is acetylcholine.

2:18:10.620 --> 2:18:13.340
 So these three neuromodulators

2:18:13.340 --> 2:18:17.880
 have this incredible reciprocal dance that they have

2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:21.120
 for you to generate what is called a natural architecture

2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:22.360
 of sleep throughout the night.

2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:23.400
 It's the push-pull again.

2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:24.800
 It's a push-pull again.

2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:29.880
 It's chest and back, it's whatever you want to think of.

2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:34.180
 That's why I think if you're trying to increase,

2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:37.800
 dramatically drive up your serotonin levels at night,

2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:39.460
 and that sustains throughout the night,

2:18:39.460 --> 2:18:41.360
 when you're trying to get into REM sleep,

2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:43.600
 you could be artificially fragmenting REM sleep.

2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:44.680
 Now, I don't know the data.

2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:47.120
 I don't think anyone's really got good data,

2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:48.780
 but that's why I would be,

2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:52.840
 you know, if you were to say, Matt, two years time,

2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:55.880
 that's the data, help me understand the potential mechanism,

2:18:55.880 --> 2:18:58.880
 or let's design some experiments, where would you go first?

2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:01.900
 I would say, let's look at the disruption of REM sleep,

2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:04.520
 non-REM sleep reciprocal regulation,

2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:07.880
 because, you know, you need serotonin to be, you know,

2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:11.000
 up at one time, down at another, so.

2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.480
 I agree with everything you said,

2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:17.640
 and I'm personally never taking tryptophan or serotonin

2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:20.520
 again, unless there's some clinical reason for that,

2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:21.880
 that I would need to do that.

2:19:21.880 --> 2:19:26.440
 I want to ask about some other pro-sleep behaviors,

2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:30.260
 but before I do that, let's talk about naps.

2:19:30.260 --> 2:19:31.520
 I love naps.

2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:34.720
 I come from a long history of nappers.

2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:36.960
 My dad always took a nap in the afternoon.

2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:40.280
 I take a 20 or 30 minute nap, or I do a practice,

2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:43.200
 which I took the liberty of coining NSDR,

2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:44.160
 non-sleep deep breaths,

2:19:44.160 --> 2:19:46.960
 some sort of just passive laying out there,

2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:49.300
 feet up, elevated, sometimes people do you,

2:19:49.300 --> 2:19:50.640
 or I'll do yoga nidra,

2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:52.360
 I'll do hypnosis or something of that sort,

2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:57.120
 but 20 or 30 minutes of that has been very beneficial

2:19:57.120 --> 2:19:59.360
 for me to get up from that nap

2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:03.120
 or period of minimal wakefulness, we'll call it,

2:20:03.120 --> 2:20:04.960
 and go about my day quite well,

2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:07.080
 and also fall asleep just fine.

2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:10.400
 What are the data on naps?

2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:13.480
 Do you nap, and what are your thoughts

2:20:13.480 --> 2:20:17.120
 about keeping naps short, meaning 20 to 30 minutes,

2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:20.560
 versus getting out past 90 minutes, two hours?

2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:25.040
 So for you personally, naps, yay, nay, or meh?

2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:30.040
 I don't nap, and I've just never been a habitual napper.

2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:33.140
 Is that because you don't feel sleepy in the afternoon,

2:20:33.140 --> 2:20:35.200
 or because- I typically don't feel sleepy.

2:20:35.200 --> 2:20:36.680
 So you're just hardier than I am.

2:20:36.680 --> 2:20:38.000
 I wouldn't say hardier.

2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:43.000
 I may be less capable of falling asleep.

2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:45.480
 My sleep drive- But you're not

2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:46.360
 dragging through the afternoon.

2:20:46.360 --> 2:20:47.920
 No, no, I don't drag through everything.

2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:50.140
 So you don't nap because you don't feel a need to nap.

2:20:50.140 --> 2:20:51.120
 That's right, yep.

2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:53.320
 Now, it's not that I am immune

2:20:53.320 --> 2:20:56.520
 to what we call a postprandial dip in alertness.

2:20:56.520 --> 2:20:58.280
 I definitely feel as though there can be

2:20:58.280 --> 2:21:01.200
 this kind of afternoon lull,

2:21:01.200 --> 2:21:04.600
 where I'm not quite as on as I was

2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:06.120
 at 11 o'clock in the morning.

2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:07.880
 And we know the physiology to that,

2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:10.740
 which brings us back to whether we were designed to nap.

2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:15.140
 So for naps, we've done lots of different studies,

2:21:15.140 --> 2:21:17.200
 and other colleagues have done these studies too.

2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:19.580
 Naps can have some really great benefits.

2:21:19.580 --> 2:21:22.200
 We found benefits for cardiovascular health,

2:21:22.200 --> 2:21:23.720
 blood pressure, for example.

2:21:23.720 --> 2:21:26.020
 We found benefits for levels of cortisol.

2:21:26.020 --> 2:21:28.360
 We found benefits for learning and memory,

2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:30.880
 and also emotional regulation.

2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:33.440
 How long are the naps typically in those studies?

2:21:33.440 --> 2:21:36.240
 Anywhere between 20 minutes to 90 minutes.

2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:38.680
 Sometimes we like to use a 90 minute window

2:21:38.680 --> 2:21:42.000
 so that the participant can have a full cycle of sleep.

2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.560
 And therefore they get both non-REM and REM sleep

2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:45.680
 within that time period.

2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:47.160
 Then when we wake them up,

2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:48.840
 we usually wait a period of time

2:21:48.840 --> 2:21:51.200
 to get them past what we call sleep inertia,

2:21:51.200 --> 2:21:53.060
 which is that kind of window of grogginess

2:21:53.060 --> 2:21:54.800
 where you say to your better half,

2:21:54.800 --> 2:21:56.200
 look, you know, darling,

2:21:56.200 --> 2:21:59.080
 please don't speak to me for the first hour.

2:21:59.080 --> 2:22:00.240
 Don't anything right now.

2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:01.800
 After the first hour of waking up,

2:22:01.800 --> 2:22:05.320
 you know, I'm just not the best version of myself.

2:22:05.320 --> 2:22:06.740
 So we wait for that time period,

2:22:06.740 --> 2:22:08.480
 and then we do some testing.

2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:10.160
 And we've done some testing before and after,

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:11.360
 and we look at the change.

2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:13.720
 And that's how we measure what was the benefit of naps.

2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:15.800
 And the reason why we sometimes do 90 minutes

2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:17.800
 so that they get all of those stages of sleep.

2:22:17.800 --> 2:22:21.000
 And then we correlate how much benefit did you get

2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.640
 from the nap and how much of that benefit

2:22:23.640 --> 2:22:26.440
 was explained by what REM sleep you got,

2:22:26.440 --> 2:22:29.080
 what deep sleep you got, what light sleep you got.

2:22:29.080 --> 2:22:30.880
 So that's the only reason that we use that

2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:33.200
 as an experimental tool.

2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:35.840
 What we've also found is that naps

2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:37.760
 of as little as 17 minutes

2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:40.000
 can have some quite potent effects on,

2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:41.800
 for example, learning.

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:43.500
 None of this is novel.

2:22:43.500 --> 2:22:47.000
 NASA pioneered this back in the 1990s.

2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:48.400
 And during the missions,

2:22:48.400 --> 2:22:51.360
 they were experimenting with naps for their astronauts.

2:22:51.360 --> 2:22:55.480
 And what they found was that naps of little as 26 minutes

2:22:55.480 --> 2:23:00.480
 improved mission performance by 34%

2:23:00.620 --> 2:23:04.420
 and improved daytime alertness by 50%.

2:23:04.420 --> 2:23:08.760
 And it birthed what was then called the NASA nap culture

2:23:08.760 --> 2:23:12.480
 throughout all terrestrial NASA staff

2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:13.680
 during that time period.

2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:17.000
 So it's long been known that naps can have a benefit.

2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.240
 Naps, however, can have a double-edged sword.

2:23:19.240 --> 2:23:21.400
 There is a dark side to naps.

2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:23.840
 And it comes back to our story

2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:26.080
 of adenosine and sleep pressure.

2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:27.200
 The longer we're awake,

2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:29.980
 the more of that sleep pressure adenosine that we build up.

2:23:29.980 --> 2:23:32.720
 But what I didn't tell you is that when we sleep,

2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:34.440
 the brain gets the chance

2:23:34.440 --> 2:23:38.600
 to essentially clear out that adenosine.

2:23:38.600 --> 2:23:41.520
 And after about 16 hours of wakefulness,

2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:43.800
 and then after about eight hours of sleep,

2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:45.280
 eight hours of sleep seems to be able

2:23:45.280 --> 2:23:49.540
 to allow the brain to decrease its adenosine levels

2:23:49.540 --> 2:23:50.880
 back to normal.

2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:53.400
 And so naturally we should start to wake up,

2:23:53.400 --> 2:23:55.480
 which also aligns with your circadian rhythm.

2:23:55.480 --> 2:23:57.600
 And those are two separate processes.

2:23:57.600 --> 2:24:00.880
 But with about eight hours of good quality sleep,

2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:03.160
 seven to nine hours for the average adult,

2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:06.160
 we are free of all of that adenosine.

2:24:06.160 --> 2:24:08.960
 We've evacuated it essentially out of the brain

2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:11.960
 and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed.

2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:14.740
 The reason that naps can be potentially dangerous

2:24:14.740 --> 2:24:16.680
 is that when you nap,

2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:19.600
 you are essentially opening the valve

2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:22.560
 on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure.

2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:27.500
 And some of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap.

2:24:27.500 --> 2:24:29.640
 So for some people and not all people,

2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:32.280
 and you're a great example of this,

2:24:32.280 --> 2:24:33.560
 some people, however,

2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:36.460
 if they are struggling with sleep at night

2:24:36.460 --> 2:24:37.840
 and they nap during the day,

2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:40.360
 it makes their sleep problems even worse.

2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:41.760
 So for people with insomnia,

2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:44.800
 we typically advise against napping.

2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:47.640
 And the advice is if you can nap regularly

2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:50.080
 and you don't struggle with sleep at night,

2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:51.760
 then naps are just fine.

2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:54.980
 But if you do struggle with sleep, stay away from naps.

2:24:54.980 --> 2:24:58.840
 If you are going to nap, try to limit your naps,

2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:01.480
 try to cut them off a bit like sort of caffeine,

2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:04.280
 maybe eight to sort of 12 hours,

2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:06.120
 maybe not that far off,

2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:09.760
 maybe sort of seven to six hours is a good rule of thumb.

2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:12.720
 Try not to nap essentially late in the afternoon.

2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:17.280
 And if you do take a nap and you want to maintain your,

2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:19.640
 you don't want to have that grogginess hangover

2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:21.360
 that can happen after a full night of sleep

2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:22.560
 for the first hour,

2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:26.080
 try to limit it to about 20, 25 minutes.

2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:27.600
 And that way you don't go down

2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:30.000
 into the very deepest stages of sleep,

2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:33.160
 which if I wrench you out of with an alarm,

2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:34.640
 then you just kind of feel,

2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:37.920
 you almost feel worse for the first hour after the nap.

2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:40.100
 I've definitely experienced that if I oversleep.

2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:43.080
 Certainly if the sun goes down during my nap

2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:47.040
 and I wake up and overall lighting conditions have changed,

2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:50.800
 I find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening

2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:52.400
 and it can screw me up.

2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:54.600
 So I try and keep those naps pretty brief.

2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:55.440
 And I should say,

2:25:56.560 --> 2:25:59.680
 I'm very happy to hear you mention individual differences

2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:01.200
 and why some people might want to nap

2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:03.680
 and other people might not want to nap.

2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:06.200
 I have a colleague Leach and Lowe,

2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:08.520
 he'll be familiar to many neurobiologists,

2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:11.020
 who's a absolutely spectacular scientist,

2:26:11.020 --> 2:26:12.100
 member of the National Academy,

2:26:12.100 --> 2:26:14.500
 Howard Hughes Investigator, just a phenom

2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:16.060
 and has a ton of energy.

2:26:16.060 --> 2:26:17.760
 But years ago,

2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:21.060
 I learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon,

2:26:21.060 --> 2:26:23.320
 so much so that when he travels to give seminars

2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:24.400
 at other universities,

2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:26.920
 he will tell his post lunch,

2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:31.480
 post, whoever it is that he's supposed to meet with,

2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:33.620
 may I have your office for 30 minutes

2:26:33.620 --> 2:26:36.560
 of our sometimes 30 minute discussion

2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:37.840
 or 60 minute discussion,

2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:39.760
 because I like to take a nap and he does that

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:42.400
 and then gives his talks are typically in the afternoon

2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:43.840
 in academic culture.

2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:48.840
 And he describes the effect of the nap for him,

2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:50.200
 these short naps in the afternoon

2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:52.160
 being so profound for his productivity.

2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:54.440
 That's actually what inspired me to start feeling okay

2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:56.240
 about my desire to nap.

2:26:56.240 --> 2:26:57.560
 And so I think for me,

2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:00.800
 that was great vindication for those that might feel guilty

2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:02.120
 about wanting a nap.

2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:06.560
 But I take to heart your note about avoiding naps

2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:08.280
 if you have trouble falling and staying asleep,

2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:10.400
 because I think that I have family members

2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:13.360
 who also if they nap, they're a wreck, they can't sleep.

2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:14.960
 Yeah, I think it's just,

2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:17.800
 we've often been very pro sleep,

2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:19.280
 we as the sort of the sleep community.

2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:22.160
 So I think it's good to always point out

2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:25.700
 these potential dark sides of any aspect.

2:27:25.700 --> 2:27:26.760
 But you're absolutely right,

2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:28.080
 no one should feel guilty

2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:30.700
 about getting the sleep that they need.

2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:33.720
 And I think that's been one of the big problems in society.

2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.000
 Society has stigmatized sleep

2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:39.080
 with these labels of being slothful or lazy.

2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:40.880
 And we're almost embarrassed,

2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:43.940
 to tell colleagues that we take a nap.

2:27:43.940 --> 2:27:48.340
 I think sleep is a right of human beings.

2:27:48.340 --> 2:27:51.960
 And I therefore think that sleep is a civil right

2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:53.640
 of all human beings.

2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:56.320
 And no one should make you feel un-proud

2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:58.520
 of getting the sleep that you need.

2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:01.960
 I love that and it's an important point.

2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:04.000
 I also feel that one of the best ways

2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:07.420
 to beat your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them.

2:28:08.480 --> 2:28:12.360
 So now that we know that sleep can enhance longevity

2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:14.720
 and lack of sleep can shorten one's life.

2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.860
 That's all the justification I need anyway.

2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:22.120
 Can somebody sleep too much?

2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:24.020
 Is it possible to get too much sleep?

2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:27.400
 It's a very good question.

2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:30.680
 And there are probably two things to say about it.

2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:33.760
 There is a condition that we call hypersomnia.

2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:36.240
 But that's a mixture of things.

2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:40.120
 It's where people have either a very high sleep need,

2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:43.120
 or they are very sleepy during the day

2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:44.800
 and they're typically falling asleep.

2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:46.520
 And these can happen in a variety

2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:48.560
 of different clinical contexts.

2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:52.220
 One of the places where we've often seen hypersomnia

2:28:52.220 --> 2:28:56.200
 believed to manifest is in depression.

2:28:56.200 --> 2:28:58.600
 But if you look at some of those studies,

2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:01.400
 it turns out it looks more as though those people

2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:04.560
 are simply reporting being in bed longer,

2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:08.000
 but not necessarily sleeping longer.

2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.160
 And that fits very well with one of the profiles

2:29:10.160 --> 2:29:13.320
 that we know of depression, which is anhedonia.

2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:15.720
 You don't get pleasure from normally pleasurable things.

2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:17.760
 So you just don't want to go out into the world.

2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:19.760
 You don't want to interact because you're depressed.

2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:20.720
 So what do you do?

2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:21.840
 You just stay in bed.

2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:23.520
 Blinds, clothes, watching TV.

2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:25.800
 Right, and that just looks as though,

2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:28.240
 when people say, what time did you go to bed

2:29:28.240 --> 2:29:30.680
 and what time did you get out of bed?

2:29:30.680 --> 2:29:32.960
 The mistake made in that question is,

2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:34.640
 okay, that's how much time they're sleeping.

2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:37.320
 When you should have said, what time did you fall asleep

2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:39.000
 and what time did you wake up?

2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.220
 And the answer could be very different.

2:29:41.220 --> 2:29:45.640
 So that's hypersomnia from a clinical context.

2:29:46.840 --> 2:29:49.280
 Can you sleep too much though?

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:52.360
 One of the data points that argue is yes, that's possible

2:29:52.360 --> 2:29:54.740
 is when we look at all cause mortality.

2:29:54.740 --> 2:29:56.440
 Certainly what you find is that

2:29:56.440 --> 2:29:59.060
 using the sweet spot of seven to nine hours,

2:29:59.060 --> 2:30:01.600
 when you start to drop below seven hours,

2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:03.560
 there is a relationship which suggests

2:30:03.560 --> 2:30:05.660
 that the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.

2:30:05.660 --> 2:30:08.760
 Short sleep in that regard predicts all cause mortality.

2:30:08.760 --> 2:30:10.740
 But it's again, not a linear relationship

2:30:10.740 --> 2:30:13.060
 like the one that we've seen with REM sleep.

2:30:13.060 --> 2:30:15.320
 Once you get past nine hours,

2:30:15.320 --> 2:30:18.160
 the mortality curve stops going down.

2:30:18.160 --> 2:30:20.640
 And then once you get further 10 or 11 hours,

2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:21.860
 it hooks back up again.

2:30:21.860 --> 2:30:24.700
 It's almost like a J shape tilted over a little bit

2:30:24.700 --> 2:30:26.260
 and reversed.

2:30:26.260 --> 2:30:27.760
 So there's this strange hook.

2:30:27.760 --> 2:30:29.520
 What's going on here?

2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:32.060
 Right now, sleep science has at least

2:30:32.060 --> 2:30:35.320
 two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this.

2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:38.560
 The first is that if you look at some of those populations,

2:30:38.560 --> 2:30:43.560
 the idea is that whatever was causing them illness

2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:46.600
 and took their lives was just too much

2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:47.940
 for sleep to deal with.

2:30:47.940 --> 2:30:50.320
 However, we know that when we get sick,

2:30:50.320 --> 2:30:51.840
 one of the things that we do immediately

2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:53.560
 in this whole mechanism,

2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:56.200
 an inflammatory mechanism, cytokine mediated,

2:30:56.200 --> 2:30:58.400
 when we get sick, we want to sleep more.

2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:02.560
 We just want to curl up in bed and sleep it off.

2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:05.560
 So the argument there is that it's not that sleep

2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:07.920
 was killing people prematurely.

2:31:07.920 --> 2:31:11.960
 It was that these people were calling on the help of sleep.

2:31:11.960 --> 2:31:13.680
 They were calling on this thing called

2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:17.080
 the Swiss army knife of health that is sleep.

2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:19.280
 But whatever it is that they were facing

2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:23.640
 was just too powerful for sleep to overcome.

2:31:23.640 --> 2:31:27.160
 So it artificially looks as though more sleep leads

2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:31.300
 to a higher risk of death when sleep was actually responding

2:31:31.300 --> 2:31:33.760
 to the mortality risk and it lost the battle.

2:31:33.760 --> 2:31:35.400
 That's one argument.

2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:39.200
 The second is that we know that sleep quality

2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:43.280
 and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor

2:31:43.280 --> 2:31:45.520
 of all cause mortality.

2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:47.960
 And when you look at people who often report

2:31:47.960 --> 2:31:51.280
 sleeping long amounts, 10 or 11 hours,

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:54.740
 they typically report having very poor quality sleep.

2:31:54.740 --> 2:31:57.240
 So because their quality of sleep is poor,

2:31:57.240 --> 2:31:59.800
 they just try to sleep longer to try

2:31:59.800 --> 2:32:01.740
 and get some of that back.

2:32:01.740 --> 2:32:05.280
 So again, here now it's poor quality sleep

2:32:05.280 --> 2:32:10.280
 masking as too much sleep leading to this artificial hook,

2:32:11.320 --> 2:32:12.840
 which looks like mortality.

2:32:12.840 --> 2:32:14.340
 That's a second explanation.

2:32:15.440 --> 2:32:17.080
 A third, which is more of a Goduncan,

2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:19.440
 which is just the kind of like a thought experiment.

2:32:19.440 --> 2:32:21.560
 And I'm of this mentality.

2:32:21.560 --> 2:32:24.520
 I don't know how many other people share this.

2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:28.880
 I actually think that could be a thing as too much sleep.

2:32:28.880 --> 2:32:31.360
 Physiologically, I think it's possible.

2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:34.260
 But the reason I think that is because it's no different

2:32:34.260 --> 2:32:37.120
 than food, water, or oxygen.

2:32:37.120 --> 2:32:38.640
 Can you overeat?

2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:39.480
 Yes, you can.

2:32:39.480 --> 2:32:40.300
 Can you undereat?

2:32:40.300 --> 2:32:41.140
 Of course.

2:32:41.140 --> 2:32:42.640
 Or light, light in the early part of the day,

2:32:42.640 --> 2:32:43.640
 throughout the day, wonderful.

2:32:43.640 --> 2:32:45.840
 Light late in the day and at night, detrimental.

2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:48.120
 Bi-directional, you know, for water,

2:32:48.120 --> 2:32:52.400
 can you over hydrate, hyponutremia, it can lead,

2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:54.840
 you know, it happened in the 1990s and 2000

2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:57.360
 with the ecstasy craze, where governments were saying,

2:32:57.360 --> 2:32:59.260
 you're dehydrating, you're dancing all night,

2:32:59.260 --> 2:33:00.720
 please drink water.

2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:02.600
 And they drank too much water.

2:33:02.600 --> 2:33:06.120
 The blood electrolytes went, you know, all over the place

2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:08.320
 and they were having cardiac arrests or stroke.

2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:09.160
 Yeah, people were dying.

2:33:09.160 --> 2:33:12.040
 And they were dying because of excessive hydration.

2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:15.000
 Can you get too much oxygen, hyperoxemia,

2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:17.060
 and it can cause free radical damage,

2:33:17.060 --> 2:33:21.120
 which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells.

2:33:21.120 --> 2:33:23.440
 Can you sleep too much, you know,

2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:26.880
 which is the fifth element of the life equation,

2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:31.560
 you know, alongside, you know, food, water, oxygen,

2:33:31.560 --> 2:33:34.820
 you know, so forth, I should say, I can't even count.

2:33:34.820 --> 2:33:36.220
 Clearly I'm sleeping well.

2:33:37.380 --> 2:33:40.720
 Yes, I think there could be that possibility.

2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:44.760
 Are most people in danger of getting too much sleep?

2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:47.600
 Au contraire, if you look at the data.

2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:50.000
 So, but I don't dismiss that idea.

2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.040
 I think it's possible.

2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:54.960
 All right, that's a very thorough and very nuanced

2:33:54.960 --> 2:33:56.340
 and yet very clear answer.

2:33:56.340 --> 2:34:01.220
 So I, it's so interesting to think that a lot of the data

2:34:01.220 --> 2:34:04.220
 that out there that talking about being in bed too long,

2:34:04.220 --> 2:34:05.760
 that it's just trying to compensate

2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:08.600
 for the actual fragmentation of sleep.

2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:11.780
 So what I'm coming away with is that there are many paths

2:34:11.780 --> 2:34:14.880
 to this and both positive and things to avoid.

2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:19.660
 But the idea is to get most nights, a similar amount,

2:34:19.660 --> 2:34:22.040
 probably seven to nine hours, somewhere in there,

2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:24.040
 of high quality sleep.

2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:27.120
 That this notion of sleep quality is going to become,

2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:30.640
 I would hope, a phrase that more people think about

2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:33.080
 and learn about and cultivate as a practice.

2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:38.600
 Want to ask about a set of behaviors that I'm at least,

2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:41.440
 I'm aware of at least one company is starting to track

2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:46.120
 in their sleep monitoring device, and that's orgasm.

2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:48.640
 And sex, orgasm, and masturbation,

2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:53.120
 topics that are somewhat sensitive,

2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:56.520
 but from the perspective of biology,

2:34:57.720 --> 2:35:00.560
 none of us would be here were it not for a sperm meets egg

2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:03.440
 in some fashion, either in a dish or in vivo.

2:35:04.340 --> 2:35:09.340
 But what are the data as you know them to be,

2:35:09.340 --> 2:35:12.500
 or maybe your lab is even doing this kind of work

2:35:12.500 --> 2:35:17.500
 and exploration, about the role that sex, orgasm,

2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:21.260
 masturbation play in getting to sleep and staying asleep

2:35:21.260 --> 2:35:22.500
 and sleep quality?

2:35:22.500 --> 2:35:25.680
 Certainly those behaviors and those physiological events

2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:27.780
 have been part of our evolutionary history.

2:35:28.980 --> 2:35:30.420
 What's the story there?

2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:33.660
 What can we say about this in terms of science

2:35:33.660 --> 2:35:36.940
 and dare I say, practice?

2:35:36.940 --> 2:35:40.020
 Yeah, I mean, it's almost that caricature of,

2:35:40.020 --> 2:35:43.020
 in the movies where a couple makes love

2:35:43.020 --> 2:35:45.820
 and then all of a sudden you just sort of hear snoring

2:35:45.820 --> 2:35:50.820
 or it happens with the idea that it's somewhat somnogenic

2:35:51.060 --> 2:35:52.700
 that it's sleep promoting.

2:35:52.700 --> 2:35:55.380
 Well, the post orgasmic increase in prolactin

2:35:55.380 --> 2:35:57.420
 Well, that's very interesting.

2:35:57.420 --> 2:36:00.900
 Is thought to be a naturally occurring sedative

2:36:00.900 --> 2:36:03.140
 that presumably has a function in-

2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:05.780
 An oxytocin has that also that benefit

2:36:05.780 --> 2:36:09.060
 where you see a dissipation of the fight or flight branch

2:36:09.060 --> 2:36:09.900
 of the nervous system,

2:36:09.900 --> 2:36:12.100
 which has to happen for you to fall asleep.

2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:15.340
 That's why we often see, here at the sleep center,

2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:18.620
 we'll see a phenomenon called wired and tired,

2:36:18.620 --> 2:36:22.260
 where people say, look, I am so desperately tired.

2:36:22.260 --> 2:36:26.220
 I just, I'm so, so tired, but I can't fall asleep

2:36:26.220 --> 2:36:27.740
 because I'm too wired.

2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:32.360
 So your sleep drive, you're desperately tired, it's there.

2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:33.860
 But because you're wired,

2:36:33.860 --> 2:36:36.020
 because you've got too much sympathetic activation,

2:36:36.020 --> 2:36:39.060
 too much cortisol as well, you can't fall asleep.

2:36:39.060 --> 2:36:44.060
 It's an impressive roadblock to anything like good sleep.

2:36:44.100 --> 2:36:46.640
 And it's one of the principle mechanisms

2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:49.980
 that we now believe stress and physiological activation

2:36:49.980 --> 2:36:54.180
 that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia.

2:36:54.180 --> 2:36:57.300
 But coming back to sex,

2:36:57.300 --> 2:37:00.180
 the data is actually quite compelling

2:37:00.180 --> 2:37:03.980
 that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality

2:37:03.980 --> 2:37:06.540
 or objective amount of sleep.

2:37:06.540 --> 2:37:10.340
 Sex that has resulted in orgasm,

2:37:10.340 --> 2:37:12.440
 and I think it's that latter part

2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:14.460
 that typically needs to happen.

2:37:14.460 --> 2:37:15.760
 I would imagine so.

2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:20.760
 That, you know, so between two mutually exclusive individuals

2:37:21.060 --> 2:37:23.780
 where both are, you know,

2:37:23.780 --> 2:37:26.380
 beneficial in terms of receiving an orgasm.

2:37:26.380 --> 2:37:28.160
 Yeah, I would say any discussion about sex,

2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:32.020
 we were referring to consensual, age appropriate,

2:37:33.540 --> 2:37:35.860
 species appropriate, context appropriate.

2:37:35.860 --> 2:37:37.620
 Wow, I would never have even gone to the species appropriate.

2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:39.980
 I put species in there because it's the internet

2:37:39.980 --> 2:37:41.660
 and people will come up with all sorts of ideas.

2:37:41.660 --> 2:37:43.620
 So I think that age appropriate,

2:37:43.620 --> 2:37:46.620
 I think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate,

2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:48.360
 and species appropriate covers all the bases.

2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:50.620
 But if I missed any, put them in the comment section

2:37:50.620 --> 2:37:51.820
 and then we'll be sure to take note.

2:37:51.820 --> 2:37:55.060
 Yeah, no, I think that's really well said

2:37:55.060 --> 2:37:56.700
 and important to say.

2:37:56.700 --> 2:37:58.700
 So the data is the,

2:37:58.700 --> 2:38:02.880
 when you look at couples who have orgasm,

2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:06.760
 we've also however found benefits of masturbation.

2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:09.580
 And it's not frequently spoken about,

2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:12.960
 but if you do some surveys,

2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:16.620
 it turns out that people will often use masturbation

2:38:16.620 --> 2:38:18.820
 as a sleep tool if they're struggling with sleep.

2:38:18.820 --> 2:38:20.620
 And I know this sort of sounds almost

2:38:20.620 --> 2:38:23.280
 like a strange conversation or it's a taboo conversation,

2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:25.740
 but I think we just need to be very open about all of this.

2:38:25.740 --> 2:38:27.660
 When I started off in science,

2:38:27.660 --> 2:38:30.340
 one of the things I worked on early in my career,

2:38:30.340 --> 2:38:31.620
 not the very first topic,

2:38:31.620 --> 2:38:35.820
 was the topic of early influences of hormones,

2:38:35.820 --> 2:38:38.700
 estrogen and testosterone on sexual development

2:38:38.700 --> 2:38:40.040
 of the brain and body.

2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:43.580
 And when you are weaned in a laboratory like that,

2:38:43.580 --> 2:38:45.180
 regardless of what era,

2:38:45.180 --> 2:38:49.420
 you look at sex and its behaviors and its hormones

2:38:49.420 --> 2:38:51.420
 and its physiologies as a scientist.

2:38:51.420 --> 2:38:53.700
 And so I think that's, to be clear what we're doing here,

2:38:53.700 --> 2:38:58.700
 we're exploring these behaviors from that perspective.

2:38:58.900 --> 2:39:00.780
 I mean, one thing is for certain,

2:39:00.780 --> 2:39:03.500
 everyone is here because a sperm met an egg,

2:39:03.500 --> 2:39:06.060
 either in a dish or in vivo, as we said before.

2:39:06.060 --> 2:39:10.640
 And at least in 2021, there's no way around that fact.

2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:14.580
 And what preceded that is typically this act we call sex.

2:39:14.580 --> 2:39:18.440
 And sometimes, hopefully I like to think,

2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:21.220
 orgasm is associated with that sexual activity.

2:39:21.220 --> 2:39:23.860
 Masturbation as one dimension of that

2:39:23.860 --> 2:39:26.660
 is something that I think can and should be discussed

2:39:26.660 --> 2:39:29.260
 if in fact there are data that relate it to sleep.

2:39:29.260 --> 2:39:31.180
 Yeah, and both of those routes

2:39:31.180 --> 2:39:34.580
 seem to lead to a sleep benefit.

2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:37.740
 Now, I'm not saying that it's all about the orgasm.

2:39:37.740 --> 2:39:40.740
 I think as we spoke about with oxytocin,

2:39:40.740 --> 2:39:43.420
 there is some degree of per bonding

2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:47.020
 that if you have a partner and you experience

2:39:47.020 --> 2:39:51.460
 an intimate loving relationship that involves that,

2:39:51.460 --> 2:39:56.120
 then you can have hormonal benefits that are sleep promoting

2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:00.420
 that may not necessarily be seen if you're just engaging

2:40:00.420 --> 2:40:03.820
 in the solo singular act of masturbation.

2:40:03.820 --> 2:40:06.100
 So what we certainly know now,

2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:08.780
 and I am not someone to take any advice on

2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:12.500
 when it comes to anything relationship wise or sex wise.

2:40:12.500 --> 2:40:14.460
 That's a different episode of the podcast.

2:40:14.460 --> 2:40:16.500
 Certainly, and that's not a podcast series

2:40:16.500 --> 2:40:18.420
 that I'm going to be releasing anytime soon.

2:40:18.420 --> 2:40:20.140
 It's going to be mostly about sleep,

2:40:20.140 --> 2:40:21.500
 although I will touch on,

2:40:21.500 --> 2:40:23.860
 I'll release a podcast on sleep and sex,

2:40:23.860 --> 2:40:27.040
 but that's the data that we have so far.

2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:29.360
 We also know that it works both ways though,

2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:32.380
 and it's commonly the same way with sleep,

2:40:33.300 --> 2:40:35.940
 sleep and exercise, sleep and diet.

2:40:35.940 --> 2:40:39.680
 How you eat can affect how you sleep,

2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:41.700
 how you sleep can affect how you eat,

2:40:41.700 --> 2:40:43.040
 same with exercise.

2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:44.740
 And it turns out it's the same way

2:40:44.740 --> 2:40:47.160
 with sexual behavior too.

2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:51.380
 So here we're talking about whether sex can help with sleep.

2:40:51.380 --> 2:40:54.460
 Can sleep help with your relationship and sex?

2:40:54.460 --> 2:40:56.660
 And the answer is yes, it can.

2:40:56.660 --> 2:40:59.220
 Firstly, we know, and we've spoken a little bit about this,

2:40:59.220 --> 2:41:00.820
 that the reproductive hormones

2:41:00.820 --> 2:41:02.700
 are under profound sleep regulation.

2:41:02.700 --> 2:41:04.740
 Both estrogen and testosterone as I understand.

2:41:04.740 --> 2:41:07.780
 Testosterone, FSH as well.

2:41:07.780 --> 2:41:10.620
 But women who, or I should say anyone who's interested

2:41:10.620 --> 2:41:12.500
 in having higher levels of estrogen

2:41:12.500 --> 2:41:15.340
 or normal healthy levels of estrogen,

2:41:15.340 --> 2:41:18.120
 I presume the data show for estrogen,

2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:21.340
 what the data also show similarly for testosterone,

2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:24.920
 which is if you get too little or poor quality of sleep,

2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:26.900
 both sex steroid hormones as they're referred to,

2:41:26.900 --> 2:41:28.620
 testosterone, crammed estrogen,

2:41:28.620 --> 2:41:30.240
 which are present in both males and females

2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:33.140
 and every variation thereof are going to be diminished

2:41:33.140 --> 2:41:34.660
 below normal healthy levels, correct?

2:41:34.660 --> 2:41:38.300
 Yep, estrogen, testosterone, FSH in women,

2:41:38.300 --> 2:41:42.420
 a key hormone in the regulation for,

2:41:42.420 --> 2:41:44.940
 key for conception, of course.

2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:46.840
 All of these sex hormones

2:41:46.840 --> 2:41:50.020
 seem to become significantly disrupted

2:41:50.020 --> 2:41:54.680
 when sleep becomes of short quantity or poor quality.

2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:56.420
 We also know that in women,

2:41:56.420 --> 2:41:58.900
 sleep disruption can usually lead

2:41:58.900 --> 2:42:01.760
 to menstrual cycle disruption.

2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:03.660
 We know this particularly from evidence

2:42:03.660 --> 2:42:04.920
 in shift working women,

2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:07.460
 where they are nighttime shift workers,

2:42:07.460 --> 2:42:09.540
 they struggle with sleep during the day,

2:42:09.540 --> 2:42:14.540
 often menstruation is disrupted or even becomes impaired.

2:42:15.700 --> 2:42:17.220
 But we also know it works this way,

2:42:17.220 --> 2:42:22.220
 not just for sex hormones, but for sex itself.

2:42:22.220 --> 2:42:26.960
 For example, we found that for every one hour of sleep,

2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:28.860
 extra sleep that a woman gets,

2:42:28.860 --> 2:42:32.340
 her interest in becoming sexually intimate with her partner

2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:37.340
 increases by 14%, which is a non-trivial amount.

2:42:38.420 --> 2:42:41.600
 And then the final part of, I think this equation

2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:46.600
 when it comes to sleep and sex is your relationship itself.

2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:49.880
 And there was some great work here from UC Berkeley

2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:52.540
 by Professor Serena Chen.

2:42:52.540 --> 2:42:55.780
 And what she found was that restless nights

2:42:55.780 --> 2:42:59.900
 mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship.

2:42:59.900 --> 2:43:02.060
 And they did this in a number of different

2:43:02.060 --> 2:43:04.220
 elegant ways and vice versa as well.

2:43:04.220 --> 2:43:06.860
 I mean, not that I've ever had conflict in relationships.

2:43:06.860 --> 2:43:09.380
 Me like, you know, this is just data I've read,

2:43:09.380 --> 2:43:11.100
 I've never experienced that at all.

2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:16.100
 So they found reliably that sleep would predict

2:43:16.100 --> 2:43:19.660
 higher likelihood of relationship conflict.

2:43:19.660 --> 2:43:22.240
 Secondly, if you got into that conflict,

2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:25.800
 the chances of you resolving it were significantly lower

2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:28.860
 when the parties had not been sleeping well.

2:43:28.860 --> 2:43:32.300
 Part of the reason is because when you are not well slept,

2:43:32.300 --> 2:43:35.460
 your empathy goes down.

2:43:35.460 --> 2:43:39.660
 So you're not, you're taking more of an abrasive stance

2:43:39.660 --> 2:43:43.220
 with your partner rather than a more agreeable stance

2:43:43.220 --> 2:43:44.540
 with your partner.

2:43:44.540 --> 2:43:49.540
 So at almost every dimension of a human loving relationship,

2:43:50.220 --> 2:43:53.100
 sleep can have a dramatic impact.

2:43:53.100 --> 2:43:55.720
 I think these are really important things to underscore.

2:43:55.720 --> 2:43:58.420
 One of the most common questions I get

2:43:58.420 --> 2:44:01.020
 because there seems to be a community of people

2:44:01.020 --> 2:44:03.420
 on the internet that are obsessed with this.

2:44:03.420 --> 2:44:05.500
 I don't know who they are because it's all,

2:44:05.500 --> 2:44:07.420
 all this internet stuff is shouting into a tunnel

2:44:07.420 --> 2:44:08.960
 and getting comments back in written form.

2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:13.480
 It's a very bizarre conversation, so to speak,

2:44:14.780 --> 2:44:17.940
 is whether or not sexual behavior itself

2:44:17.940 --> 2:44:19.700
 lowers or increases testosterone.

2:44:19.700 --> 2:44:24.700
 And I went into the data, which spans many decades actually,

2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:26.580
 both animal studies and human studies.

2:44:26.580 --> 2:44:28.620
 And it seems just to underscore this,

2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:30.200
 as long as we're talking about the subject,

2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:34.620
 that it does seem that sexual activity,

2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:37.000
 sex between two people,

2:44:38.140 --> 2:44:41.060
 does seem to increase testosterone in both.

2:44:42.460 --> 2:44:45.700
 There is this question about orgasm or no orgasm,

2:44:45.700 --> 2:44:47.440
 ejaculation, no ejaculation.

2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:50.020
 And indeed there do seem to be some effects

2:44:50.020 --> 2:44:54.380
 of restricting ejaculation in males

2:44:54.380 --> 2:44:57.100
 as a form of further increasing testosterone.

2:44:57.100 --> 2:45:00.260
 So sex without ejaculation, further increasing testosterone.

2:45:00.260 --> 2:45:02.780
 But the data are not clean,

2:45:02.780 --> 2:45:05.140
 presumably because organizing these sorts of studies

2:45:05.140 --> 2:45:06.900
 and getting truth in self-reporting

2:45:06.900 --> 2:45:09.700
 is probably hard to get from subjects.

2:45:09.700 --> 2:45:14.480
 But everything sort of points in the direction

2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:19.240
 that provided that the relationship is a healthy one,

2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:20.800
 it's consensual, it's age appropriate,

2:45:20.800 --> 2:45:22.800
 context appropriate, species appropriate,

2:45:22.800 --> 2:45:25.500
 that sex between two individuals does seem to increase

2:45:25.500 --> 2:45:28.020
 the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen,

2:45:28.020 --> 2:45:29.140
 toward healthy ranges.

2:45:29.140 --> 2:45:30.680
 And what I'm hearing now,

2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:33.000
 the sort of gestalt of the discussion we just had,

2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:37.100
 is that that too can promote sleepiness,

2:45:37.100 --> 2:45:40.040
 restful states, and quality sleep.

2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:42.980
 And I think this is an important conversation

2:45:42.980 --> 2:45:44.500
 that just hasn't been held enough.

2:45:44.500 --> 2:45:47.280
 I mean, sooner or later, both in the US and elsewhere,

2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:48.700
 we're going to have to acknowledge

2:45:48.700 --> 2:45:51.260
 that we are biological organisms of some sort

2:45:51.260 --> 2:45:54.940
 and that we have choice in life about all these things

2:45:54.940 --> 2:45:57.640
 from supplementation to sex or no sex, et cetera,

2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:02.060
 but that they have profound effects on our core biology.

2:46:02.060 --> 2:46:04.420
 I mean, it's fascinating to me

2:46:04.420 --> 2:46:06.140
 that the areas of the hypothalamus,

2:46:06.140 --> 2:46:08.480
 the preoptic area, the superoptic areas,

2:46:09.380 --> 2:46:11.420
 those areas, which the names might not mean anything

2:46:11.420 --> 2:46:13.860
 to anybody besides Matt and I sitting here,

2:46:13.860 --> 2:46:16.900
 but those areas sit cheek to jowl with each other

2:46:16.900 --> 2:46:20.620
 in the hypothalamus and control sleep and sex.

2:46:20.620 --> 2:46:24.660
 The trigger of orgasm, the appetite for food,

2:46:24.660 --> 2:46:26.820
 the appetite for water, for electrolytes.

2:46:26.820 --> 2:46:31.820
 I mean, the hypothalamus is kind of a festival of neurons

2:46:32.460 --> 2:46:35.500
 with different booths for different primitive behaviors.

2:46:35.500 --> 2:46:36.780
 It's such a small, small structure in the brain,

2:46:36.780 --> 2:46:40.140
 but it's the orchestrator of a fast number of our behaviors,

2:46:40.140 --> 2:46:43.620
 disproportionate in terms of its size versus effect.

2:46:43.620 --> 2:46:46.140
 Yeah, I don't think you can go to this hypothalamic festival

2:46:46.140 --> 2:46:48.920
 without at least seeing all the booths,

2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:50.720
 whether or not you decide to visit them or not.

2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:51.560
 I love that.

2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:53.400
 Master analogy.

2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:58.400
 So I'm glad that we've broached that conversation,

2:46:58.620 --> 2:47:01.740
 and I hope people will think that we've approached it

2:47:01.740 --> 2:47:03.340
 with the appropriate level of sensitivity.

2:47:03.340 --> 2:47:05.940
 It's an important one that we're going to hear more about

2:47:05.940 --> 2:47:06.780
 one way or the other.

2:47:06.780 --> 2:47:07.980
 People are certainly thinking about this,

2:47:07.980 --> 2:47:10.440
 if not engaging in these sorts of behaviors

2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:11.780
 or avoiding them.

2:47:11.780 --> 2:47:14.420
 So the more we can understand about the biology, the better.

2:47:14.420 --> 2:47:15.980
 Well said.

2:47:15.980 --> 2:47:17.860
 And so thank you for bringing that topic up

2:47:17.860 --> 2:47:20.960
 because for the record, Matt tabled it for discussion.

2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:24.180
 I said, we were just like chatting outside.

2:47:24.180 --> 2:47:26.020
 And I think we'd said something about, yeah,

2:47:26.020 --> 2:47:27.980
 sort of sex and I said, yeah, we can go there.

2:47:27.980 --> 2:47:29.420
 That's actually interesting data.

2:47:29.420 --> 2:47:30.340
 Absolutely.

2:47:32.300 --> 2:47:35.220
 I want to touch on just two remaining topics.

2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:40.220
 One is, are there any unconventional sleep tips

2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:42.900
 or things about sleep that we've overlooked?

2:47:42.900 --> 2:47:44.860
 If we've covered everything, great,

2:47:44.860 --> 2:47:47.700
 but you know, we're here to keep the room cool.

2:47:47.700 --> 2:47:50.680
 We here, because of this temperature phenomenon,

2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:54.260
 the light aspects, the considerations about alcohol, CBD,

2:47:54.260 --> 2:47:57.800
 marijuana, cognitive behavioral,

2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:01.460
 tart cherry fruit, kiwis, perhaps.

2:48:01.460 --> 2:48:03.700
 Please don't put me on the hook for tart cherries and kiwi.

2:48:03.700 --> 2:48:05.540
 I was just offering what I know about the data.

2:48:05.540 --> 2:48:06.820
 And these are considerations

2:48:06.820 --> 2:48:09.500
 and whether or not people batch these things.

2:48:09.500 --> 2:48:10.860
 I won't even list them off now

2:48:10.860 --> 2:48:13.500
 because there are too many jokes that one could make.

2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:17.320
 And I have no affiliation with any of these products

2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:18.160
 or companies or whatever.

2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:19.820
 I'm going to take out stock in a kiwi company.

2:48:19.820 --> 2:48:21.480
 No, I'm just kidding.

2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:26.420
 But the question I have is about any unconventional

2:48:26.420 --> 2:48:28.700
 or lesser known things, or maybe you do things

2:48:28.700 --> 2:48:32.820
 or you think about things just in a purely exploratory way

2:48:32.820 --> 2:48:37.220
 as a scientist, you know, the what if kind of things

2:48:37.220 --> 2:48:40.760
 that, yeah, what if it turns out that,

2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:44.540
 and I hear I've got a blank there for you to fill in.

2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:48.380
 I think, you know, beyond the standard, you know,

2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:52.320
 fair that I've dished out plenty of times of sleep hygiene

2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.080
 of, you know, regularity, temperature, darkness,

2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:59.520
 alcohol, caffeine, and we've spoken about all of those.

2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:02.340
 What are some more unconventional tips, I guess?

2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:05.900
 The first one, which is unconventional

2:49:05.900 --> 2:49:07.860
 along the lines of naps,

2:49:07.860 --> 2:49:09.860
 if you've had a bad night of sleep,

2:49:09.860 --> 2:49:12.840
 let's say that you're starting to emerge with insomnia

2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:14.800
 and you've had a bad night of sleep,

2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:16.540
 the advice and I learned this

2:49:16.540 --> 2:49:20.440
 from my wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis, do nothing.

2:49:21.340 --> 2:49:24.660
 What I mean by that is, don't wake up any later,

2:49:24.660 --> 2:49:27.700
 don't sleep in the following day to try and make up for it.

2:49:27.700 --> 2:49:30.500
 Don't nap during the day.

2:49:30.500 --> 2:49:33.860
 Don't consume extra caffeine to wake you up

2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:35.580
 to try to get you through the day.

2:49:35.580 --> 2:49:37.900
 And don't go to bed any earlier

2:49:37.900 --> 2:49:40.780
 to think that you're going to compensate.

2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:42.960
 And I can explain all of those things,

2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:44.740
 but if you wake up later,

2:49:44.740 --> 2:49:47.580
 you're not going to be sleepy until later the evening.

2:49:47.580 --> 2:49:49.620
 So you're gonna go to bed at your normal time

2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:50.620
 and you won't be sleeping.

2:49:50.620 --> 2:49:53.700
 You'll think, well, I just came off a bad night of sleep

2:49:53.700 --> 2:49:57.060
 and now I still, I can't even get to sleep

2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:58.500
 and it's my normal time.

2:49:58.500 --> 2:50:01.420
 It's because you slept in later than you would otherwise

2:50:01.420 --> 2:50:04.700
 and you reduce the window of adenosine accumulation

2:50:04.700 --> 2:50:06.600
 before your normal bedtime.

2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:09.900
 So don't go, don't wake up any later.

2:50:09.900 --> 2:50:12.660
 Don't use more caffeine for the reasons that are obvious

2:50:12.660 --> 2:50:13.860
 because that's only gonna crank you

2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:15.380
 and keep you awake the following night

2:50:15.380 --> 2:50:18.340
 or decrease the probability of a good following night

2:50:18.340 --> 2:50:19.480
 of recovery sleep.

2:50:20.580 --> 2:50:23.360
 Third, I mentioned don't take naps

2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:25.920
 because once again, that will just take,

2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:28.340
 naps particularly later in the afternoon,

2:50:28.340 --> 2:50:31.460
 I almost liken them to snacking before a main meal.

2:50:31.460 --> 2:50:33.680
 It just takes your appetite off the edge

2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:36.380
 of that main meal of sleep, so don't do it.

2:50:36.380 --> 2:50:39.200
 And then finally, don't go to bed any earlier.

2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:42.960
 Resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time.

2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:45.780
 What I want to try and do is prevent you from thinking,

2:50:45.780 --> 2:50:47.500
 well, I had such a bad night last night

2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:49.220
 and I normally go to bed at 10.30,

2:50:49.220 --> 2:50:51.440
 I'm just gonna get into bed at nine o'clock

2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:53.580
 because last night was just so bad.

2:50:53.580 --> 2:50:55.740
 But that's not your natural bedtime

2:50:55.740 --> 2:50:58.620
 and it's not aligned with your natural chronotype

2:50:58.620 --> 2:51:01.580
 because presumably you kind of know something about that

2:51:01.580 --> 2:51:02.900
 or a morning type, evening type

2:51:02.900 --> 2:51:04.100
 and you're trying to sleep in harmony,

2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:07.060
 which is usually how you get best quality sleep.

2:51:07.060 --> 2:51:09.820
 But you go to bed at nine and my body is not ready

2:51:09.820 --> 2:51:12.060
 to sleep at nine o'clock.

2:51:12.060 --> 2:51:14.320
 But I'm worried because I had a bad night of sleep

2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:17.220
 last night, so I get into bed and now I'm tossing

2:51:17.220 --> 2:51:19.060
 and turning for the first hour and a half

2:51:19.060 --> 2:51:21.100
 because it's not my natural sleep window,

2:51:21.100 --> 2:51:23.220
 but I just thought it was a good idea.

2:51:23.220 --> 2:51:25.460
 And if I didn't know anything about sleep,

2:51:25.460 --> 2:51:27.740
 I would think all of these same things too,

2:51:27.740 --> 2:51:29.740
 so I'm not finger wagging.

2:51:29.740 --> 2:51:33.360
 But if I have a bad night of sleep and I am not immune,

2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:35.980
 just because I know a little bit about sleep

2:51:35.980 --> 2:51:38.840
 doesn't mean I don't have my bad nights, I do.

2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:41.340
 Doesn't mean I haven't had bouts of insomnia in my life,

2:51:41.340 --> 2:51:42.580
 I have.

2:51:42.580 --> 2:51:46.140
 But after a bad night of sleep, I do nothing.

2:51:46.140 --> 2:51:49.480
 I don't do any of those four things.

2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:52.280
 I think the second tip I would offer

2:51:52.280 --> 2:51:56.660
 in terms of unconventional is have a wind down routine.

2:51:56.660 --> 2:52:01.660
 Many of us think of sleep as if it's like a light switch,

2:52:01.740 --> 2:52:04.460
 that we just jump into bed and when we turn the light out,

2:52:04.460 --> 2:52:07.060
 sleep should arrive in that same way.

2:52:07.060 --> 2:52:09.440
 Just the binary, you know, it's on or it's off.

2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:11.200
 Sleep is a physiological process.

2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:13.940
 It's much more like landing a plane.

2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:16.660
 It takes time to gradually descend down

2:52:16.660 --> 2:52:18.780
 onto the terra firma of what we call

2:52:18.780 --> 2:52:21.060
 good solid sleep at night.

2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:23.260
 Find out whatever works for you

2:52:23.260 --> 2:52:25.300
 and it could be light stretching.

2:52:25.300 --> 2:52:30.200
 I usually meditate for about 10 or 15 minutes before bed.

2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:32.580
 Some people like reading.

2:52:32.580 --> 2:52:34.260
 Try not to watch television in bed,

2:52:34.260 --> 2:52:35.100
 that's usually advised against.

2:52:35.100 --> 2:52:36.420
 Something that doesn't emit too much light to your eyes.

2:52:36.420 --> 2:52:38.540
 Too much light, too activating.

2:52:38.540 --> 2:52:40.580
 You know, you can listen to a relaxing podcast,

2:52:40.580 --> 2:52:43.480
 although we can speak about technology in the bedroom too,

2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:47.280
 but have some kind of a wind down routine.

2:52:47.280 --> 2:52:50.560
 It's, you know, it's almost like, you know,

2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:53.220
 you wouldn't race into your garage

2:52:53.220 --> 2:52:57.740
 and come to a screeching halt from 60 miles an hour.

2:52:57.740 --> 2:53:00.260
 You typically downshift your gears

2:53:00.260 --> 2:53:01.800
 and you slow down as you come into the garage.

2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:04.080
 That's the same thing with sleep too.

2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:05.120
 So that's the second thing.

2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:07.060
 Have some kind of a wind down routine.

2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:08.140
 Find what works for you.

2:53:08.140 --> 2:53:11.140
 Maybe it's taking a hot bath or a warm shower

2:53:11.140 --> 2:53:12.480
 and then stick to it.

2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:14.260
 Just, we do this with kids all the time.

2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:16.200
 We find out what their bedroom,

2:53:16.200 --> 2:53:18.660
 sorry, their bedtime regiment is

2:53:18.660 --> 2:53:21.060
 and then we just stick to it faithfully

2:53:21.060 --> 2:53:24.460
 because we humans are the same way too.

2:53:24.460 --> 2:53:26.380
 The third thing is a myth.

2:53:26.380 --> 2:53:27.900
 Don't count sheep.

2:53:27.900 --> 2:53:29.420
 There was a study done here at UC Berkeley.

2:53:29.420 --> 2:53:30.580
 I didn't do this today, I wish I did.

2:53:30.580 --> 2:53:33.000
 It was by my colleague, Professor Alison Harvey.

2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.220
 And they found that counting sheep

2:53:35.220 --> 2:53:37.460
 actually made it harder to fall asleep.

2:53:37.460 --> 2:53:39.260
 It made matters worse.

2:53:39.260 --> 2:53:42.340
 As a counter, sorry, counter measure to that,

2:53:42.340 --> 2:53:45.140
 what they did find was that taking yourself

2:53:45.140 --> 2:53:47.580
 on some kind of a mental walk.

2:53:47.580 --> 2:53:50.420
 So think about a nice walk that you take in nature

2:53:50.420 --> 2:53:51.700
 or a walk on the beach

2:53:51.700 --> 2:53:54.580
 or even a walk around an urban environment

2:53:54.580 --> 2:53:59.000
 and visualizing that, that seemed to be beneficial.

2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:02.260
 The other thing about sort of that idea

2:54:02.260 --> 2:54:06.260
 of shifting focus away from your mind itself,

2:54:06.260 --> 2:54:09.680
 get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice.

2:54:10.540 --> 2:54:14.240
 Catharsis, you can try to write down

2:54:14.240 --> 2:54:16.880
 all of the concerns that you have

2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:19.240
 and do this not right before bed,

2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:21.980
 but usually an hour or two before bed.

2:54:21.980 --> 2:54:24.680
 Some people call it a worry journal.

2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:28.020
 And to me, it's a little bit like closing down

2:54:28.020 --> 2:54:30.620
 all of the emotional tabs on my browser.

2:54:30.620 --> 2:54:33.420
 Because if I shut the computer down

2:54:33.420 --> 2:54:35.600
 and all of those tabs are still open,

2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:36.680
 I'm going to come back in the morning

2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:38.780
 and the computer's red hot, the fan's going

2:54:38.780 --> 2:54:40.580
 because it didn't go to sleep.

2:54:40.580 --> 2:54:41.420
 Because it couldn't,

2:54:41.420 --> 2:54:43.700
 because there were too many tabs active and open.

2:54:43.700 --> 2:54:45.580
 I think it's the same way with sleep as well.

2:54:45.580 --> 2:54:47.320
 So try to think about doing that.

2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:50.660
 So just vomit out all of your concerns on the page.

2:54:50.660 --> 2:54:51.500
 I like that.

2:54:51.500 --> 2:54:53.500
 My 3 a.m. waking is often associated

2:54:53.500 --> 2:54:54.980
 with me writing down the list of things

2:54:54.980 --> 2:54:56.700
 that I forgot to do that I need to do.

2:54:56.700 --> 2:54:57.540
 Yeah.

2:54:57.540 --> 2:54:59.100
 And once I eventually wake up

2:54:59.100 --> 2:55:03.220
 from the later night, second half of the night's sleep,

2:55:03.220 --> 2:55:05.500
 that stuff seems much more tractable and reasonable,

2:55:05.500 --> 2:55:08.020
 but it sure would be great to get that stuff

2:55:08.020 --> 2:55:09.500
 out of the way before sleep.

2:55:09.500 --> 2:55:10.620
 Well, there's also something

2:55:10.620 --> 2:55:12.940
 that I don't think people have spoken about a lot

2:55:12.940 --> 2:55:15.700
 and I'd like to research it, which is

2:55:18.300 --> 2:55:23.200
 difficulty and anxiety at night in the dark

2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:27.380
 is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day.

2:55:27.380 --> 2:55:31.380
 And when we have those thoughts at night,

2:55:31.380 --> 2:55:33.980
 it comes with a magnitude of rumination

2:55:33.980 --> 2:55:38.540
 and catastrophization that is disproportionate

2:55:38.540 --> 2:55:41.520
 to that which you would describe when you are awake.

2:55:42.460 --> 2:55:47.000
 And I don't know what's going on about the brain

2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.540
 and thought and emotion at the time.

2:55:49.540 --> 2:55:52.340
 I've got a bunch of theories as to why.

2:55:52.340 --> 2:55:55.980
 And that's why I like the idea of closing up,

2:55:55.980 --> 2:55:58.940
 zipping up all of those different components,

2:55:58.940 --> 2:56:03.780
 just get them out on the page and it feel,

2:56:03.780 --> 2:56:06.340
 and I at first thought, this just sounds like Huey.

2:56:06.340 --> 2:56:07.580
 It sounds very Berkeley.

2:56:07.580 --> 2:56:09.740
 It's kind of come by our, we all hold hands

2:56:09.740 --> 2:56:12.140
 and walk home at the end of the day.

2:56:12.140 --> 2:56:14.500
 But then the data started coming out,

2:56:14.500 --> 2:56:16.220
 really good studies from good people.

2:56:16.220 --> 2:56:18.740
 And they found that keeping one of those journals

2:56:18.740 --> 2:56:23.240
 decreased the time it takes you to fall asleep by 50%, 5-0.

2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:24.080
 Amazing.

2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:26.300
 Well on par with any pharmaceutical agent.

2:56:26.300 --> 2:56:27.300
 Oh, absolutely.

2:56:27.300 --> 2:56:29.060
 I'm convinced that, well,

2:56:29.060 --> 2:56:31.980
 I've long thought that the worries and concerns

2:56:31.980 --> 2:56:35.140
 and ideas I have at three, 4 a.m.,

2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:37.420
 I've learned to not place any stock in them.

2:56:37.420 --> 2:56:41.140
 Because something, I'm glad that you might decide

2:56:41.140 --> 2:56:43.020
 to eventually look at this in your laboratory,

2:56:43.020 --> 2:56:46.420
 because I feel like something is melted away or altered.

2:56:46.420 --> 2:56:49.920
 I suspect it's in the regulation

2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:51.880
 of the autonomic nervous system,

2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:55.180
 that it makes sense why a concern at three, 4 a.m.

2:56:55.180 --> 2:56:59.620
 ought to evoke more of a panic sense than a concern sense.

2:56:59.620 --> 2:57:01.160
 And certainly that's my experience,

2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:03.040
 although I'm fortunate to not suffer

2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:04.480
 from full-blown panic attacks,

2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:06.940
 but everything seems worse at three, 4 a.m.,

2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:07.880
 provided you're awake.

2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:09.820
 And we need to sort of look into that,

2:57:09.820 --> 2:57:13.060
 because if you look at suicide rates

2:57:13.060 --> 2:57:15.440
 around the 24-hour clock face,

2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:17.480
 disproportionately higher rates

2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:21.100
 in those middle sort of night hours.

2:57:21.100 --> 2:57:23.900
 So now I don't know if that's causative or not,

2:57:23.900 --> 2:57:25.660
 but something, it could just be that

2:57:25.660 --> 2:57:27.460
 that's the time when we're mostly lonely

2:57:27.460 --> 2:57:29.220
 and we're by ourselves, and that's the reason.

2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:31.300
 So it's got nothing to do with sleep or the nighttime.

2:57:31.300 --> 2:57:32.140
 I don't know.

2:57:33.300 --> 2:57:34.480
 So that's the third thing.

2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:37.660
 I think the fourth sort of little tip I would give

2:57:37.660 --> 2:57:41.340
 that's unconventional is remove all clock faces

2:57:41.340 --> 2:57:42.420
 from your bedroom.

2:57:42.420 --> 2:57:43.420
 Including your phone.

2:57:43.420 --> 2:57:46.780
 Including your phone, and resist checking it.

2:57:46.780 --> 2:57:49.860
 Now I know, and I can speak about the phone too,

2:57:49.860 --> 2:57:52.660
 that genie of technology is out the bottle,

2:57:52.660 --> 2:57:54.260
 and it's not going back in anytime soon.

2:57:54.260 --> 2:57:57.540
 So we've got to think as scientists and sleep scientists

2:57:57.540 --> 2:58:01.100
 as to what we do with phones in the bedroom.

2:58:01.100 --> 2:58:03.180
 Years ago, I was a counselor at a summer camp.

2:58:03.180 --> 2:58:04.820
 I worked with at-risk kids,

2:58:04.820 --> 2:58:07.100
 and there was a phrase that comes to mind here.

2:58:07.100 --> 2:58:09.180
 It's be a channel, not a dam.

2:58:09.180 --> 2:58:12.900
 Because when you try and dam certain kinds of behavior,

2:58:12.900 --> 2:58:15.900
 physically dam certain kinds of behavior, not morally dam,

2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:20.900
 that too, it just creeps over the edge,

2:58:20.960 --> 2:58:24.060
 and you get a waterfall.

2:58:24.060 --> 2:58:25.300
 So it has to be channeled.

2:58:25.300 --> 2:58:27.700
 The phone and devices have to be worked with

2:58:27.700 --> 2:58:28.740
 and negotiated, not eliminated.

2:58:28.740 --> 2:58:31.560
 That's right, and think about those mindfully too.

2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:34.680
 But clock faces, remove all of those.

2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:38.260
 Because if you are having a tough night,

2:58:38.260 --> 2:58:40.600
 knowing that it's 3.22 in the morning,

2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:43.140
 or it's 4.48 in the morning,

2:58:43.140 --> 2:58:46.020
 does not help you in the slightest.

2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:48.960
 And it's only going to make matters worse than better.

2:58:48.960 --> 2:58:51.580
 So try to remove all clock faces.

2:58:51.580 --> 2:58:53.360
 And I think that's one of those other tips

2:58:53.360 --> 2:58:55.260
 that some people have found helpful.

2:58:55.260 --> 2:58:58.720
 But those would be sort of some slightly unconventional,

2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:01.020
 I guess, more than your stock fare of,

2:59:01.020 --> 2:59:03.660
 here are the five tips for sleep hygiene tonight.

2:59:04.580 --> 2:59:07.660
 Those are terrific sleep tips, and several of which,

2:59:07.660 --> 2:59:09.960
 if not all of which, I'm going to incorporate.

2:59:09.960 --> 2:59:14.640
 Matt, this has been an amazing deep dive on sleep,

2:59:14.640 --> 2:59:17.000
 and it's positive and negative regulators.

2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:18.460
 I hope it hasn't been too long.

2:59:18.460 --> 2:59:20.160
 No, this has been great.

2:59:20.160 --> 2:59:23.280
 Please cut it down, shorten it to the five minutes

2:59:23.280 --> 2:59:24.840
 of meaningful stuff that I offer.

2:59:24.840 --> 2:59:26.000
 Absolutely not, absolutely not.

2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:28.960
 It is chock-a-block full of valuable takeaways.

2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:32.080
 It's been tremendously fun for me

2:59:32.080 --> 2:59:35.560
 to dissect out this incredible aspect of our lives

2:59:35.560 --> 2:59:37.800
 that we call sleep with a fellow scientist

2:59:37.800 --> 2:59:39.760
 and a fellow public educator.

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:42.320
 I want to say several things.

2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:46.440
 First of all, we should say where people can find you,

2:59:46.440 --> 2:59:48.480
 although it shouldn't be that difficult these days.

2:59:48.480 --> 2:59:51.360
 You're a very present on the internet.

2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:53.440
 For better or for worse.

2:59:53.440 --> 2:59:54.980
 I think it's wonderful that you're out there.

2:59:54.980 --> 2:59:58.600
 Look, it's a public health service that you're doing.

2:59:58.600 --> 3:00:01.680
 No one requires you or any other scientist to get out

3:00:01.680 --> 3:00:04.560
 and share this information.

3:00:04.560 --> 3:00:07.080
 My sense of you knowing you a bit

3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:08.640
 and from following your work very closely,

3:00:08.640 --> 3:00:10.300
 both your scientific work in detail

3:00:10.300 --> 3:00:13.400
 and your public facing educational work

3:00:13.400 --> 3:00:16.680
 is that you very much want the best for people.

3:00:16.680 --> 3:00:20.560
 And it's an interesting thing as a scientist or a clinician

3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:24.680
 to know that certain answers exist,

3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:25.800
 that we don't have all the answers,

3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:27.260
 but that there is a better path.

3:00:27.260 --> 3:00:28.100
 There are better ways

3:00:28.100 --> 3:00:30.440
 and people can benefit in a myriad of ways.

3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:34.300
 So for that, because I know that to be very genuine in you,

3:00:35.460 --> 3:00:36.680
 you want the best for people

3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:41.160
 and you're offering tremendous advice and considerations

3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:42.520
 and people can take it or leave it.

3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:43.580
 That's the way I view it.

3:00:43.580 --> 3:00:45.700
 I also want to thank you for taking the time out of your day

3:00:45.700 --> 3:00:49.560
 to sit with me here and have this discussion.

3:00:49.560 --> 3:00:50.640
 It's a privilege.

3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:51.560
 It's a delight.

3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:54.640
 You know, you and I, I think we're like kind

3:00:54.640 --> 3:00:55.540
 in lots of ways.

3:00:55.540 --> 3:00:59.600
 And I take you as a shining example

3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:03.640
 of how you can effectively connect with the public.

3:01:03.640 --> 3:01:05.680
 And I know that we've had our conversations

3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:08.800
 before we ever sat down sort of together about, you know,

3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:12.200
 how to think about communicating with the public

3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:14.240
 and the pros and cons of that.

3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.460
 And I've just loved your opinions.

3:01:16.460 --> 3:01:18.520
 I've been drinking it all in.

3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:21.560
 And then I think the third thing I'd like to say is,

3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:25.280
 thank you for being such an incredible sleep ambassador.

3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:27.720
 The series that you've released on sleep,

3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:29.220
 the way that you speak about sleep,

3:01:29.220 --> 3:01:33.040
 the way that you moderate and have championed sleep,

3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:34.720
 it is remarkable.

3:01:34.720 --> 3:01:39.720
 So thank you for just being a brother in arms in that way.

3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:43.240
 Well, we are, and thanks for those words.

3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:45.960
 99% of what I discussed there was the work of you

3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:47.560
 and your colleagues in the sleep field.

3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:49.640
 So proper acknowledgement, but thank you.

3:01:49.640 --> 3:01:52.000
 Where can people learn more

3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.800
 about what you're doing currently and what's coming next?

3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:56.000
 You're on Twitter.

3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:58.360
 I am on Twitter.

3:01:58.360 --> 3:02:00.440
 I typically tweet.

3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:01.640
 As the sleep diplomat.

3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:03.920
 So it's, no, it's just sleep diplomat.

3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:08.920
 Sleep diplomat on Twitter, sleepdiplomat.com website.

3:02:10.740 --> 3:02:13.360
 If you want to learn more about the science that we do here,

3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:16.280
 it's humansleepscience.com.

3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:18.900
 It's the Center for Human Sleep Science.

3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:23.960
 You can pick up a copy of the book if you want.

3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:25.600
 It's called Why We Sleep.

3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:29.040
 If you're curious about sleep, that's one path to take.

3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:29.880
 And it's my view.

3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:32.000
 Is there another book someday in the future?

3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.480
 I think there may be.

3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:35.000
 Yeah, I think there are.

3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:36.560
 Many, many millions of people

3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:38.040
 will be very happy to hear that.

3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:40.440
 I think it's starting to take hold.

3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:43.040
 And then as we discussed,

3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:46.680
 I am more than kicking around the idea

3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:49.720
 of a short form podcast rather than a long form.

3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:53.600
 Not long form because I don't have the mental capacity

3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:57.520
 or the interviewing just capability

3:02:57.520 --> 3:02:59.080
 that someone like you has.

3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:01.380
 So it will probably just be monologue short form.

3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:05.140
 So if there is some interest, I'll probably do that as well.

3:03:05.140 --> 3:03:07.280
 So those are the ways that people can find me.

3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:10.520
 But overall, if you're interested in sleep,

3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:12.160
 just listen to Andrew.

3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:14.000
 That's the best thing I can tell people.

3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:16.500
 All right, well now we're batting back and forth

3:03:16.500 --> 3:03:19.660
 the vector of action, so to speak.

3:03:19.660 --> 3:03:22.260
 But I do hope you'll start a podcast,

3:03:22.260 --> 3:03:25.800
 however brief or lengthy these episodes turn out to be,

3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:27.560
 because I do believe that's a great venue

3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:29.480
 to get information out into the world.

3:03:29.480 --> 3:03:33.360
 And we don't just want to hear more from Matt Walker.

3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:35.260
 I speak for many people.

3:03:35.260 --> 3:03:36.100
 We need to.

3:03:36.100 --> 3:03:38.660
 The work you're doing is both influential,

3:03:38.660 --> 3:03:41.720
 but more importantly, it is important work.

3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:44.880
 It has the impact that's needed,

3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:47.860
 especially in this day and age where science and medicine,

3:03:47.860 --> 3:03:51.440
 public health, and the issues of the world, et cetera,

3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:52.360
 are really converging.

3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:56.120
 So I know I speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people

3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:58.400
 and I just say thank you for doing the work you do

3:03:58.400 --> 3:03:59.720
 and for being you.

3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:01.340
 And thanks for being a good friend.

3:04:01.340 --> 3:04:02.800
 Likewise too.

3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:05.200
 And by the way, I just going to note that

3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:10.200
 it was nice that the two of us both got the Johnny Cash memo

3:04:10.380 --> 3:04:12.320
 about how to dress today.

3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:14.280
 It seems as though we're both kind of,

3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:15.580
 we got that same memo,

3:04:15.580 --> 3:04:18.080
 which will mean nothing to people who are listening.

3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:19.920
 But if you're watching the video,

3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:21.400
 you'll probably see what I mean.

3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:23.020
 Andrew, thank you for taking this time.

3:04:23.020 --> 3:04:23.860
 Thank you so much.

3:04:23.860 --> 3:04:25.060
 Thanks so much, Matt.

3:04:25.060 --> 3:04:27.100
 Thank you for joining me for my discussion

3:04:27.100 --> 3:04:29.020
 with Dr. Matt Walker.

 Links to those sponsors can be found in the show notes.

3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:11.100
 During this episode and in many previous episodes,

3:05:11.100 --> 3:05:12.640
 we discussed supplements.

3:05:12.640 --> 3:05:14.260
 One issue in the supplement industry

3:05:14.260 --> 3:05:16.640
 is that many supplements don't contain

3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:18.360
 what's listed on the bottle.

3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:20.160
 We therefore have partnered with Thorne,

3:05:20.160 --> 3:05:23.160
 that's T-H-O-R-N-E, Thorne supplements,

3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:25.160
 because Thorne supplements have the highest levels

3:05:25.160 --> 3:05:28.080
 of stringency in terms of the purity of the ingredients

3:05:28.080 --> 3:05:31.500
 and precision with respect to what's listed on the bottle

3:05:31.500 --> 3:05:34.400
 is actually what's contained in those supplement bottles.

3:05:34.400 --> 3:05:36.240
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take

3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:38.080
 for sleep and for other things,

3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:42.680
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

3:05:42.680 --> 3:05:45.400
 And there you'll see all the supplements that I take

3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:47.640
 and can get 20% off any of those supplements

3:05:47.640 --> 3:05:49.480
 as well as any other supplements

3:05:49.480 --> 3:05:50.660
 that Thorne happens to make.

3:05:50.660 --> 3:05:55.160
 That's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,.com slash the letter U

3:05:55.160 --> 3:05:56.760
 slash Huberman.

3:05:56.760 --> 3:05:59.080
 And last, but certainly not least,

3:05:59.080 --> 3:06:00.880
 thank you for your interest in science.

3:06:00.880 --> 3:06:27.880
 And I'll see you in the next one.
