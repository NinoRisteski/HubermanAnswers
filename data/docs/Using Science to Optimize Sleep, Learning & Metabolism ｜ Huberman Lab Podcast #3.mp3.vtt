00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.800
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.800 --> 00:13.400
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.400 --> 00:15.560
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.440
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.440 --> 00:19.440
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.620
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.620 --> 00:23.840
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.840 --> 00:25.920
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.920 --> 00:27.660
 to the general public.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.720
 Along those lines, I want to thank the sponsors

00:29.720 --> 00:31.280
 of today's podcast.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.320
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens,

00:33.320 --> 00:35.900
 which is an all-in-one vitamin mineral

00:35.900 --> 00:38.080
 probiotic liquid supplement.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.540
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,

00:41.540 --> 00:43.080
 because I really like getting

00:43.080 --> 00:46.200
 my total vitamin mineral base covered

00:46.200 --> 00:49.000
 in one easy-to-consume product.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.960
 It also tastes really good.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.480
 I've mixed mine with a little bit of lemon juice.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.640
 I've been doing that well for well over a decade now.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.140
 And the inclusion of probiotics is important to me

00:57.140 --> 01:00.000
 because there's a lot of data out there right now

01:00.000 --> 01:01.500
 about the importance of gut health

01:01.500 --> 01:03.960
 for the immune system, for mood.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.900
 And so by combining all these things in one product,

01:06.900 --> 01:08.560
 I get all those things at once.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.100
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

01:10.100 --> 01:13.480
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

01:13.480 --> 01:15.560
 and that will give you a special offer

01:15.560 --> 01:17.240
 where you will get a year's supply

01:17.240 --> 01:20.180
 of liquid vitamin D3 and K2.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.300
 Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important

01:22.300 --> 01:25.260
 for various aspects of immune function,

01:25.260 --> 01:27.360
 as well as other biological functions.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.720
 And so once more, if you want to try Athletic Greens

01:29.720 --> 01:32.400
 and get the year's supply of vitamin D3, K2,

01:32.400 --> 01:36.260
 just go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

01:36.260 --> 01:39.560
 The other sponsor of today's podcast is Inside Tracker.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.560
 Inside Tracker is a way to measure metabolic factors,

01:44.600 --> 01:48.200
 hormones, and DNA-related factors

01:48.200 --> 01:50.520
 by way of blood tests and saliva

01:50.520 --> 01:52.880
 in order to assess one's health.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.960
 I'm a big believer in blood tests and saliva tests

01:55.960 --> 01:59.920
 for assessing one's health markers because I like data.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.240
 And there's really no other way to measure

02:02.240 --> 02:04.440
 what's going on in one's body

02:04.440 --> 02:08.280
 without taking the occasional blood test or saliva test.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.220
 You can guess what's going on,

02:10.220 --> 02:11.940
 but if you really want to know what's going on

02:11.940 --> 02:15.680
 under the hood, Inside Tracker can be of great help.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.280
 One of the problems with a lot of products out there,

02:18.280 --> 02:19.660
 or just regular blood testing,

02:19.660 --> 02:21.160
 is that you get a lot of data back

02:21.160 --> 02:23.480
 about the levels of various hormones, metabolic factors,

02:23.480 --> 02:25.920
 et cetera, but you don't know what to do with those data.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.680
 Great thing about Inside Tracker is it is provided

02:28.680 --> 02:31.320
 in a format, they have an online dashboard,

02:31.320 --> 02:35.000
 that given your particular levels of various things,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.360
 directs you toward potential lifestyle-related changes

02:39.360 --> 02:43.200
 like changes in exercise or changes in sleep patterns

02:43.200 --> 02:45.600
 or changes in nutritional patterns

02:45.600 --> 02:48.840
 that can really help move those markers and those numbers

02:48.840 --> 02:51.080
 on those metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

02:51.080 --> 02:52.960
 in the direction that you want.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.520
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

02:54.520 --> 02:57.680
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

02:57.680 --> 02:58.740
 And if you do that,

02:58.740 --> 03:02.700
 you'll get 25% off their program at checkout.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.620
 Okay, let's get started.

03:04.620 --> 03:06.680
 Today is episode three of the podcast

03:06.680 --> 03:08.400
 and it is Office Hours.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.600
 Office Hours, as many of you know,

03:10.600 --> 03:13.400
 is where students come to the office of the professor,

03:13.400 --> 03:15.360
 sit down and ask questions,

03:15.360 --> 03:18.640
 requesting clarification about things that were confusing

03:18.640 --> 03:22.840
 or to simply go down the route of exploring a topic

03:22.840 --> 03:25.200
 with more depth and detail.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.760
 I asked for your questions to be listed

03:27.760 --> 03:30.080
 in the comment section of the previous two episodes

03:30.080 --> 03:33.140
 of the podcast on YouTube, as well as on Instagram.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.000
 And I, first of all, just want to thank you

03:35.000 --> 03:37.780
 for the many questions, they are excellent.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.160
 We read them all.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.200
 We distilled from that large batch of questions

03:43.200 --> 03:45.480
 to two types of questions,

03:45.480 --> 03:47.380
 questions that were asked very often

03:47.380 --> 03:51.360
 and were liked very often with a little thumbs up like tab,

03:51.360 --> 03:53.660
 as well as questions that we thought could really expand

03:53.660 --> 03:56.480
 on the topics that we've covered previously.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.520
 And today we're going to cover both of those.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.860
 If we did not get to your question, please don't despair.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.240
 We will keep track of those.

04:05.240 --> 04:08.600
 And we have several more episodes devoted to this topic

04:08.600 --> 04:11.440
 of sleep and wakefulness and learning

04:11.440 --> 04:14.340
 during the month of January, maybe even, you know,

04:14.340 --> 04:16.400
 leaking over a little bit into the month of February.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.000
 So we have time, that's one of the unique formats

04:19.000 --> 04:21.680
 of this podcast is that we have time for dialogue.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.960
 We have time for your questions

04:22.960 --> 04:26.440
 and we have time to really go deep into these topics.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.800
 It's official, Costello is sleeping in the background.

04:28.800 --> 04:33.160
 So if you hear snoring, Costello is going to be keeping time

04:33.160 --> 04:36.400
 with his deep and melodic snoring.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.440
 There he goes.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.760
 So the questions that we received,

04:40.760 --> 04:44.780
 I batched crudely into a couple of different categories,

04:44.780 --> 04:48.180
 light, exercise, supplementation,

04:49.320 --> 04:52.440
 temperature, learning, plasticity,

04:52.440 --> 04:55.160
 and mood and sort of mood related disorders.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.960
 There were a lot of questions about those.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.600
 Before we begin any of this,

04:58.600 --> 05:00.860
 I want to point out something that I always say,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.460
 it sounds like boilerplate,

05:02.460 --> 05:04.320
 but it's important not just to protect me,

05:04.320 --> 05:07.320
 but to protect you, which is that I am not a physician.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.320
 I'm not a medical doctor.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.640
 I don't prescribe anything, including behavioral protocols.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.600
 I'm a professor, so I profess a lot of things

05:13.600 --> 05:15.820
 based on quality peer-reviewed studies.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.060
 You should take that information,

05:18.060 --> 05:20.080
 you should filter it through whatever it is

05:20.080 --> 05:22.640
 that you currently happen to be dealing with,

05:22.640 --> 05:24.160
 whether or not that's health or illness,

05:24.160 --> 05:27.920
 you should consult with a licensed healthcare professional

05:27.920 --> 05:30.680
 before you add or remove anything

05:30.680 --> 05:32.260
 from your daily life protocol.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.500
 I'm not responsible for your health, you are,

05:35.500 --> 05:37.600
 so be smart with this information

05:37.600 --> 05:41.360
 and be a stringent filter, as we say.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.120
 Okay, very well.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.340
 Let's get started on the actual material.

05:46.240 --> 05:51.240
 Somebody asked, what is the role of moonlight and fire?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.980
 I'm presuming they mean fireplace or candle

05:54.980 --> 05:56.440
 or things of that sort.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.480
 In setting circadian rhythms,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.280
 is it okay to view moonlight at night

06:01.280 --> 06:02.680
 or will that wake me up?

06:02.680 --> 06:06.240
 Will a fire in my fireplace or using candlelight

06:06.240 --> 06:07.840
 be too much light?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.280
 Great question.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.880
 Also offers me the opportunity to share with you

06:11.880 --> 06:14.280
 what I think is a quite beautiful definition

06:14.280 --> 06:17.700
 of what light is in a quantitative sense.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.280
 So I've mentioned a few times the use of apps

06:21.280 --> 06:24.880
 and light meters and things to measure things like lux,

06:24.880 --> 06:28.600
 which sometimes are also described in terms of candelas.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.560
 So those are the two units for measuring light intensity.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.920
 Typically lux, L-U-X, is the unit.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.680
 And so before we go forward and discuss this many lux

06:37.680 --> 06:40.960
 or that many lux, I want to just tell you what a lux is

06:40.960 --> 06:42.760
 because it relates to this question.

06:42.760 --> 06:47.760
 One lux equals the illumination of one square meter surface

06:48.800 --> 06:51.960
 at one meter away from a single candle.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.760
 So somebody actually decided at some point

06:55.760 --> 07:00.240
 that the amount of illumination at one square meter surface

07:00.240 --> 07:03.800
 one meter away from a single candle, that equals one lux.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.000
 So when we talk about 6,000 lux of light intensity

07:08.000 --> 07:10.200
 or 10,000 lux of light intensity,

07:10.200 --> 07:13.120
 now you have a kind of a reference or a framework

07:13.120 --> 07:14.680
 that would be the equivalent of,

07:14.680 --> 07:16.920
 you could think of it as 6,000 candles

07:16.920 --> 07:20.680
 all with their light intensity shown on one square meter

07:20.680 --> 07:22.800
 from one meter's distance away.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.880
 Or of course, if it was a different number of lux

07:24.880 --> 07:26.400
 it would be a different number of candles.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.800
 So you get the idea.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.680
 Here's the great thing.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.280
 Turns out that moonlight, candlelight

07:33.280 --> 07:34.580
 and even a fireplace,

07:34.580 --> 07:35.960
 if you have one of these roaring fires

07:35.960 --> 07:37.680
 going in the fireplace,

07:37.680 --> 07:41.080
 do not reset your circadian clock at night

07:41.080 --> 07:44.040
 and trick your brain into thinking that it's morning.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.980
 Even though if you've ever sat close to a fireplace

07:46.980 --> 07:50.040
 or even a candle, that light seems very bright.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.860
 And there are two reasons for that that are very important.

07:52.860 --> 07:56.280
 The first one is that these neurons in your eye

07:56.280 --> 07:58.040
 that I discussed in the previous episode,

07:58.040 --> 08:00.640
 these melanopsin ganglion cells,

08:00.640 --> 08:03.920
 also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,

08:03.920 --> 08:07.940
 those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day.

08:07.940 --> 08:11.280
 And those cells respond best to the blue-yellow contrast

08:11.280 --> 08:13.820
 present in the rising and setting sun,

08:13.820 --> 08:15.740
 so-called low solar angle sun,

08:15.740 --> 08:17.960
 also discussed in the previous episode.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.400
 But those cells adjust their sensitivity

08:20.400 --> 08:25.400
 such that they will not activate the triggers in the brain

08:25.400 --> 08:30.400
 that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight,

08:30.920 --> 08:34.500
 even a full moon, a really bright moon or fire.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.200
 Now, this does raise an interesting kind of thought point,

08:37.200 --> 08:39.960
 which is a lot of people have talked about lunacy

08:39.960 --> 08:41.520
 and the fact that when there's a full moon out,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.020
 people act differently and behave differently.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.340
 There's a lot of lore around that.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.420
 There's actually a little bit of quality science around that

08:47.420 --> 08:49.280
 that maybe we can address in the future.

08:49.280 --> 08:54.280
 But moonlight is typically not going to wake us up too much,

08:54.280 --> 08:57.400
 except maybe if the moon is really full and really bright,

08:57.400 --> 08:58.980
 there's possibility for that.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.040
 So provided you're not going to burn down

09:01.040 --> 09:02.060
 the structure you're in,

09:02.060 --> 09:03.320
 you're not going to burn down the forest,

09:03.320 --> 09:08.080
 enjoy your fireplaces, enjoy your lights from candles,

09:08.080 --> 09:09.560
 and those are perfectly safe

09:09.560 --> 09:11.280
 without disrupting your circadian rhythm.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.720
 Because we talked about just how crucial it is

09:13.720 --> 09:14.760
 to avoid bright lights

09:14.760 --> 09:17.720
 between the hours of about 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,

09:17.720 --> 09:21.360
 except when you need to view things for sake of safety

09:21.360 --> 09:24.480
 or work and so forth.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.560
 I also received a lot of questions about red light.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.240
 Now, I think I was asked those questions

09:29.240 --> 09:31.760
 because red light is used

09:31.760 --> 09:33.920
 in a number of different commercial products

09:33.920 --> 09:36.200
 where these products tend to include

09:36.200 --> 09:38.600
 a sheet of very bright red lights

09:38.600 --> 09:41.440
 that one is supposed to view early in the day.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.920
 And there are various claims

09:42.920 --> 09:45.080
 attached to these red light devices,

09:45.080 --> 09:46.920
 that they improve mitochondrial function,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.360
 that they improve metabolism.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.240
 I'm going to be really honest,

09:51.240 --> 09:52.320
 and I can't name brands,

09:52.320 --> 09:54.400
 and I'm not going to name particular studies

09:54.400 --> 09:56.180
 because what I'm about to say about these studies

09:56.180 --> 10:00.520
 is not particularly unkind,

10:00.520 --> 10:03.560
 but let's just say that none of the studies that I've seen,

10:03.560 --> 10:06.700
 except for one that I'll talk about in a moment,

10:06.700 --> 10:09.320
 pointing to the positive effects of red light

10:09.320 --> 10:10.800
 on the visual system,

10:12.120 --> 10:13.800
 are published in blue ribbon journals.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.220
 They tend to be published in journals

10:15.220 --> 10:17.940
 that I had to work hard to find.

10:17.940 --> 10:21.120
 I'm not sure what the peer review and stringency level is.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.000
 Now, that's not to say red light isn't beneficial

10:23.000 --> 10:25.320
 because there is one study in particular

10:25.320 --> 10:26.820
 that came from Glenn Jeffrey's lab

10:26.820 --> 10:28.160
 at the University of College London.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.200
 It was published last year.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.960
 Glenn is somebody I happen to know,

10:31.960 --> 10:35.600
 has an excellent reputation, excellent vision scientist.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.380
 What this study essentially showed,

10:37.380 --> 10:40.760
 and again, this is a study that I very much like the data

10:40.760 --> 10:43.160
 and think it was done with very high standards.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.680
 What this study shows is that viewing red light

10:47.680 --> 10:52.680
 for a few minutes each morning can have positive effects

10:52.960 --> 10:56.140
 on mitochondria in a particular retinal cell type

10:56.140 --> 10:58.840
 that tends to degenerate or decline in function

10:58.840 --> 11:00.160
 with age in humans,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.920
 and that cell type is the photoreceptor.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.360
 The photoreceptor is a type of cell in your eye

11:06.360 --> 11:08.000
 that sits at the back of the eye.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.560
 It's kind of some distance away from the ganglion cells,

11:10.560 --> 11:12.980
 and it's the cell that converts light information

11:12.980 --> 11:15.520
 into electrical signals that the rest of the retina

11:15.520 --> 11:17.360
 and brain can understand.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.140
 These are vitally important cells.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.160
 Without them, people are blind.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.720
 And many people's vision gets worse with age,

11:24.720 --> 11:26.740
 in particular age-related macular degeneration,

11:26.740 --> 11:29.240
 but also related to some other factors,

11:29.240 --> 11:32.480
 including photoreceptor functionality

11:32.480 --> 11:33.720
 just getting worse with time.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.760
 And what Glenn showed was that red light flashes

11:37.760 --> 11:39.840
 delivered in particular early in the day

11:39.840 --> 11:43.560
 but not late in the day can help repair the mitochondria.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.840
 Now, this study needs more support from additional studies,

11:47.840 --> 11:48.800
 of course.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.040
 They are doing a clinical trial.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.020
 They did report on what I think it was 12 patients.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.060
 And so the work is ongoing, but that was very interesting.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.000
 And it points to some potentially really useful things

12:00.000 --> 12:01.480
 about red light.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.640
 However, most of the questions I got about red light

12:04.640 --> 12:06.100
 for sake of office hours

12:06.100 --> 12:08.520
 were about the use of red light later in the day.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.340
 So here's the deal.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.880
 In principle, red light

12:11.880 --> 12:14.680
 will not stimulate the melanopsin retinal neurons

12:14.680 --> 12:17.200
 that wake up the brain and circadian clock

12:17.200 --> 12:19.000
 and signal daytime.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.480
 However, most of the red lights,

12:20.480 --> 12:21.740
 in particular the red lights

12:21.740 --> 12:23.360
 that come on these sheets of these products

12:23.360 --> 12:25.360
 that people are supposed to view them

12:25.360 --> 12:29.680
 in order to access a number of proclaimed health effects,

12:29.680 --> 12:31.360
 those are way too bright

12:31.360 --> 12:34.360
 and would definitely wake up your body and brain.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.240
 So if you're going to use those products,

12:36.240 --> 12:38.260
 and I'm not suggesting you do or you don't,

12:38.260 --> 12:39.640
 but if that's your thing,

12:39.640 --> 12:41.180
 you would want to use those early in the day.

12:41.180 --> 12:43.000
 Who knows, you might even derive some benefit

12:43.000 --> 12:46.160
 on mitochondrial function in these photoreceptors.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.240
 But if you're thinking about red light

12:48.240 --> 12:51.080
 for sake of avoiding the negative effects of light

12:51.080 --> 12:53.040
 later in the day and at night,

12:53.040 --> 12:55.440
 then you want that red light to be very, very dim,

12:55.440 --> 12:56.360
 certainly much dimmer

12:56.360 --> 12:59.280
 than is on most of those commercial products.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.640
 Now, do you need red lights?

13:01.640 --> 13:03.580
 No, although red lights are rather convenient

13:03.580 --> 13:05.820
 because you can see pretty well with them on,

13:05.820 --> 13:08.720
 but if they're dim, they won't wake up the circadian clock,

13:08.720 --> 13:11.320
 they won't have this dopamine disrupting thing

13:11.320 --> 13:13.120
 that we talked about in the previous podcast.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.520
 So there's a role for red light

13:14.520 --> 13:15.880
 potentially early in the day

13:15.880 --> 13:18.680
 and for mitochondrial repair in the photoreceptors,

13:18.680 --> 13:20.900
 there's a role for dim red light

13:20.900 --> 13:22.520
 later in the day and at night.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.020
 So you're starting to notice a theme here,

13:24.020 --> 13:26.720
 which is that there's no immediate prescription

13:26.720 --> 13:28.080
 of look at these lights,

13:28.080 --> 13:30.240
 it's look at these lights potentially,

13:30.240 --> 13:32.800
 if that's what you want to do at particular times of day

13:32.800 --> 13:34.360
 and with particular intensities.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.000
 It brings us back to the blue light issue,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.340
 which is so many people are obsessed

13:37.340 --> 13:38.560
 with avoiding blue light,

13:38.560 --> 13:39.960
 but you actually want a ton of blue light

13:39.960 --> 13:41.320
 early in the day and throughout the day,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.160
 so don't wear your blue blockers then,

13:43.160 --> 13:44.520
 or maybe even don't wear them at all.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.640
 And at night, it doesn't matter

13:45.640 --> 13:47.120
 if you have blue blockers on,

13:47.120 --> 13:48.920
 if the lights are bright enough,

13:48.920 --> 13:51.000
 then you're still going to be activating

13:51.000 --> 13:52.760
 these cells and mechanisms.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.640
 I just want to add something

13:55.640 --> 14:00.540
 about the science behind the blue blocker confusion.

14:00.540 --> 14:05.520
 So these melanopsin retinal cells do react to blue light.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.360
 That is the best stimulus for one of these melanopsin cells,

14:08.360 --> 14:10.520
 which led to the belief that blue blockers

14:10.520 --> 14:12.020
 would be a good thing for preventing

14:12.020 --> 14:13.900
 resetting of the circadian clock at night

14:13.900 --> 14:17.000
 and deleterious effects of screens, et cetera.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.200
 However, the people that made these products

14:20.200 --> 14:23.320
 failed to actually read the papers start to finish,

14:23.320 --> 14:26.080
 or if they did, they didn't comprehend a critical element,

14:26.080 --> 14:28.900
 which is that most of those papers early on

14:28.900 --> 14:31.400
 took those neurons out and put them in a dish,

14:31.400 --> 14:34.540
 and when they did that, they divorced those neurons

14:34.540 --> 14:37.640
 from their natural connections in the eye.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.360
 Turns out in your eye, in my eye right now,

14:40.360 --> 14:43.000
 because that's what we care about, these cells exist,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.280
 and these cells respond to blue light,

14:45.280 --> 14:47.280
 but also to other wavelengths of light

14:47.280 --> 14:49.840
 because they not only respond directly to light

14:49.840 --> 14:51.040
 as they do in a dish,

14:51.040 --> 14:55.360
 they also respond to input from photoreceptors.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.440
 So if you talk to anyone in the circadian biology field,

14:58.440 --> 15:00.280
 they'll tell you, oh, yeah, this blue light thing

15:00.280 --> 15:01.560
 has really gotten out of control

15:01.560 --> 15:04.920
 because people assume that blue light is the culprit

15:04.920 --> 15:06.640
 because blue light is the best stimulus.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.080
 That doesn't mean that blue light is the only stimulus

15:09.080 --> 15:10.920
 that will trigger these cells, okay?

15:10.920 --> 15:14.200
 So like many things, a scientific paper can be accurate

15:14.200 --> 15:16.960
 without being exhaustive, and a lot of claims about products

15:16.960 --> 15:18.440
 can be accurate but not exhaustive.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.540
 So blue light during the day is great.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.840
 Get that screen light, get that sunlight especially,

15:22.840 --> 15:24.680
 get overhead lights.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.000
 I talk about all this in the previous podcast,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
 but at night, you really want to avoid those bright lights,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.120
 and it doesn't matter if it's blue light or something else,

15:32.120 --> 15:35.280
 and so there was a real confusion about the papers

15:35.280 --> 15:39.780
 and the data when most of those product recommendations

15:39.780 --> 15:40.620
 were made.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.620
 Okay, while we're on that topic,

15:44.620 --> 15:48.000
 let's talk about light in other orifices of the body.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.020
 I made kind of a joke about this the last podcast episode,

15:51.020 --> 15:52.800
 but a couple of people wrote to me and said,

15:52.800 --> 15:55.760
 well, I've seen some claims that light delivered

15:55.760 --> 15:59.000
 to the ears, into the ears or the roof of the mouth

15:59.000 --> 16:00.740
 or up the nose can be beneficial

16:00.740 --> 16:02.880
 for setting circadian rhythms.

16:02.880 --> 16:07.720
 No, not directly anyway,

16:07.720 --> 16:10.080
 and this is a great opportunity for us to distinguish

16:10.080 --> 16:13.160
 between what is commonly called the placebo effect,

16:13.160 --> 16:15.980
 but a more important way to think about any manipulation,

16:15.980 --> 16:18.240
 behavioral or otherwise, that you might do

16:18.240 --> 16:22.160
 is the difference between modulation and mediation.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.920
 There are a lot of things that will modulate your biology.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.800
 Putting a couple of lights up your nose,

16:27.800 --> 16:31.560
 please don't do this, might modulate your biology

16:31.560 --> 16:33.880
 by way of the stress hormone that's released

16:33.880 --> 16:35.820
 when you stuff those things up your nose.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.240
 Remember earlier, previous podcasts,

16:38.240 --> 16:40.260
 I said that virtually anything will phase shift

16:40.260 --> 16:41.880
 your circadian rhythm if it's different

16:41.880 --> 16:43.260
 and dramatic enough.

16:43.260 --> 16:47.720
 So the question is, is it the light delivered up the nose

16:47.720 --> 16:49.920
 or through the ears or some other orifice

16:49.920 --> 16:51.840
 that's mediating the process?

16:51.840 --> 16:54.860
 Is it actually tapping into the natural biology

16:54.860 --> 16:57.660
 of the system that you're trying to manipulate?

16:57.660 --> 16:58.920
 And this is where I like to distinguish

16:58.920 --> 17:01.200
 between real biology and hacks.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.920
 I don't like the word hack

17:02.920 --> 17:05.400
 or frankly neuro-hacking or bio-hacking.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.000
 I just don't like the term

17:07.000 --> 17:10.760
 because a hack is using something for a purpose

17:10.760 --> 17:13.040
 for which it was not intended, right?

17:13.040 --> 17:15.400
 But where you can kind of, it's a kind of a cheat

17:15.400 --> 17:17.640
 and that's not how biology works well.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.460
 So I try and distinguish between things

17:19.460 --> 17:21.580
 that really mediate biological processes

17:21.580 --> 17:23.520
 and things that modulate them.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.520
 There are a number of commercial products out there

17:26.520 --> 17:28.000
 with some studies attached to them

17:28.000 --> 17:29.960
 claiming that light delivered to the ears

17:29.960 --> 17:33.280
 or wherever can adjust your wakefulness

17:33.280 --> 17:34.760
 or adjust your sleep.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.800
 I've looked at those papers again,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.440
 I'm probably going to lose some friends by saying this

17:38.440 --> 17:40.380
 but maybe I'll gain a few as well.

17:40.380 --> 17:43.360
 Not blue ribbon journals frankly,

17:43.360 --> 17:45.480
 oftentimes read the small print.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.320
 There was a conflict of interest clause there

17:47.320 --> 17:49.160
 related to commercial interests.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.000
 If somebody disagrees with me outright on this

17:52.000 --> 17:55.360
 and can send to me a peer reviewed paper

17:55.360 --> 17:57.920
 published in a quality journal about light delivered

17:57.920 --> 18:00.200
 anywhere but the eyes of humans

18:00.200 --> 18:03.700
 that can mediate circadian rhythms, wakefulness, et cetera.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.400
 I'm more than happy to take a look at that

18:05.400 --> 18:08.560
 and change my words and stance on this

18:08.560 --> 18:10.440
 and do it publicly of course.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.980
 But until then, I'm guessing that the proper controls

18:14.980 --> 18:18.240
 were not done of adjusting for heat that could be delivered

18:18.240 --> 18:19.840
 which can definitely shift circadian rhythms.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.960
 We're going to talk about temperature

18:20.960 --> 18:22.160
 and other things like that.

18:22.160 --> 18:26.120
 So light to the eyes folks is where these light effects

18:26.120 --> 18:28.020
 work in humans, in other animals

18:28.020 --> 18:30.740
 they have extraocular photoreception in humans, no.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.680
 And just be mindful.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.880
 I mean, I'm not trying to encourage people

18:34.880 --> 18:37.220
 to avoid certain products in particular

18:37.220 --> 18:38.840
 but just be mindful of this difference

18:38.840 --> 18:41.560
 between modulation and mediation.

18:41.560 --> 18:46.440
 And mediating a process through a hardwired

18:46.440 --> 18:48.360
 or longstanding biological mechanism

18:48.360 --> 18:49.440
 is really where you're going to see

18:49.440 --> 18:51.200
 the powerful effects over time.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.920
 I also, as you've probably noticed,

18:52.920 --> 18:55.980
 I really tend to favor behavioral tools

18:55.980 --> 18:59.020
 and zero cost tools first and getting those dialed in

18:59.020 --> 19:03.040
 before you start plugging in and swallowing

19:03.040 --> 19:06.000
 and putting things in various places

19:06.000 --> 19:08.140
 just to really figure out how your biology works

19:08.140 --> 19:09.180
 and explore that.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.680
 Unless there's of course a clinical need

19:10.680 --> 19:13.080
 to take a prescribed drug in which case

19:13.080 --> 19:15.180
 by all means, listen to your doctor.

19:15.180 --> 19:19.460
 Okay, a huge number of people asked me about

19:19.460 --> 19:21.680
 what about light through windows?

19:21.680 --> 19:24.160
 And I actually did an Instagram post about this.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.840
 Look, setting your circadian clock

19:28.840 --> 19:30.560
 with sunlight coming through a window

19:30.560 --> 19:32.720
 is going to take 50 to 100 times longer.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.520
 If you want the date on that,

19:34.520 --> 19:36.920
 I'd be happy to send you to the various papers

19:36.920 --> 19:38.800
 that were described in the previous podcast

19:38.800 --> 19:41.120
 that Jamie Zeitzer from Stanford

19:41.120 --> 19:43.240
 and I have discussed also elsewhere.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.600
 But here's really the key thing with this.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.620
 Do the experiment.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.180
 You can download the free app Light Meter.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.640
 You can have a bright day outside or some sunlight.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.440
 Hold up that app, take a picture.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.680
 It'll tell you how many lux.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.020
 Now you know what lux are.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.120
 It will tell you how many lux are in that environment.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.580
 Now close the window.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.600
 And if you want, close the screen or don't open the screen.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.680
 You can do all sorts of experiments

20:02.680 --> 20:05.200
 and you'll see that it will at least half

20:05.200 --> 20:08.780
 the amount of lux and it doesn't scale linearly.

20:08.780 --> 20:13.320
 Meaning let's say I get a 10,000 lux outside,

20:13.320 --> 20:15.400
 5,000 looking out through an open window

20:15.400 --> 20:18.260
 and then I close the window and it's 2,500 lux.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.840
 It does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight

20:20.840 --> 20:25.480
 for twice as long if it's half as many lux, okay?

20:25.480 --> 20:28.960
 It's not like 2,500 lux means you need to look

20:28.960 --> 20:33.040
 for 10 minutes and 5,000 lux means you look for five minutes.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.640
 It doesn't scale that way

20:34.640 --> 20:37.000
 just because the biology doesn't work that way.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.440
 Best thing to do is to get outside if you can.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.960
 If you can't, next best thing to do

20:40.960 --> 20:42.560
 is to keep that window open.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.120
 It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses

20:45.120 --> 20:46.560
 and contacts.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.000
 Why is it okay to wear prescription lenses and contacts

20:49.000 --> 20:50.840
 when those are glass also?

20:50.840 --> 20:54.860
 But looking through a window diminishes the effect?

20:54.860 --> 20:56.540
 Well, we should think about this.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.800
 The lenses that you wear in front of your eyes

20:58.800 --> 21:00.720
 by prescription or on your eyes are designed

21:00.720 --> 21:03.440
 to focus the light onto your neural retina.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.700
 In fact, that's what nearsightedness is,

21:05.700 --> 21:06.740
 is when the image,

21:06.740 --> 21:09.120
 because your lens doesn't work quite right,

21:09.120 --> 21:11.320
 the image falls in front of the neural retina,

21:11.320 --> 21:14.040
 wearing a particular lens in front of that

21:14.040 --> 21:17.360
 focuses the lens onto your retina, onto these very neurons

21:17.360 --> 21:19.960
 so they can communicate that to the brain.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.840
 Costello is loving this.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.980
 He's deep in sleep.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.060
 And if we, maybe we could play him some tones

21:25.060 --> 21:26.980
 and he'll remember it later based on the studies

21:26.980 --> 21:28.880
 we're going to talk about in a little bit.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.120
 I don't know how we'd know if he remembered it or not,

21:32.120 --> 21:35.340
 but prescription lenses are fine.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.900
 In fact, they're great for this reason.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.940
 They're actually focusing the light onto the retina.

21:39.940 --> 21:41.960
 So think about this logically

21:41.960 --> 21:43.520
 and all of a sudden it makes perfect sense.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.120
 Your glass window or your windshield

21:46.120 --> 21:48.240
 or the side window of your car,

21:48.240 --> 21:53.000
 it isn't optically perfect to bring the image

21:53.000 --> 21:54.520
 and the light onto your retina.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.180
 In fact, what it's doing is it's scattering

21:56.180 --> 21:57.120
 and filtering light,

21:57.120 --> 21:59.440
 in particular the wavelengths of light that you want.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.880
 So if you live in a low light environment,

22:02.880 --> 22:04.060
 lots of questions about this.

22:04.060 --> 22:05.760
 We talked about this the previous podcast,

22:05.760 --> 22:08.760
 but just get outside for longer.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.840
 Or, and or use really bright lights inside.

22:12.840 --> 22:15.360
 Okay, so let's think about why

22:15.360 --> 22:17.100
 I'm making some of these recommendations

22:17.100 --> 22:20.520
 because I think it can really empower you

22:20.520 --> 22:23.800
 with the ability to change your behavior

22:23.800 --> 22:26.500
 in terms of light viewing and other things,

22:26.500 --> 22:28.240
 depending on time of year,

22:28.240 --> 22:32.040
 depending on other lifestyle factors.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.920
 The important point to understand is that early in the day,

22:34.920 --> 22:38.160
 your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms

22:38.160 --> 22:40.200
 are looking for a lot of light.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.520
 I mean, they don't have a mind of their own,

22:41.520 --> 22:43.280
 but it needs a lot of light

22:43.280 --> 22:46.220
 to trigger this daytime signal alertness, et cetera.

22:47.440 --> 22:51.240
 And early in the day, but not in the middle of the day,

22:51.240 --> 22:53.920
 you can sum or add photons.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.200
 So there's this brief period of time early in the day

22:56.200 --> 22:58.220
 when the sun is low in the sky,

22:58.220 --> 23:00.480
 when your brain and body are expecting

23:00.480 --> 23:02.280
 a morning wake up signal,

23:02.280 --> 23:04.520
 where let's say it's not that bright outside.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.800
 Someone sent me a picture or a little movie

23:06.800 --> 23:09.960
 of their walk in England and it was pretty overcast.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.360
 And they were using light meter and they said,

23:11.360 --> 23:15.040
 it's only about 700 lux or maybe even less.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.560
 And I said, well, stay outside longer.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.860
 But when you get inside,

23:18.860 --> 23:20.160
 turn on the lights really bright

23:20.160 --> 23:21.920
 and overhead lights in particular,

23:21.920 --> 23:25.800
 because those will be best for stimulating these mechanisms.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.080
 And that's because at least

23:27.080 --> 23:28.520
 for the first few hours of the day,

23:28.520 --> 23:32.800
 you can continue to sum or add photon activation

23:32.800 --> 23:35.340
 of the cells in the eye and the brain.

23:35.340 --> 23:37.380
 In the middle of the day, once the sun is overhead,

23:37.380 --> 23:40.300
 or even if you stay inside all morning,

23:40.300 --> 23:43.000
 and then you're in the circadian dead zone,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.280
 which sounds terrible.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.280
 And it is terrible because it doesn't matter

23:46.280 --> 23:50.120
 if you get a ton of artificial light or even sunlight,

23:50.120 --> 23:51.520
 you're not going to shift your circadian clock.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.960
 You're not going to get that wake up signal.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.820
 And then in the evening,

23:55.820 --> 23:57.520
 you want to think about this whole system

23:57.520 --> 24:00.280
 as being vulnerable to even a few photons of light

24:00.280 --> 24:03.200
 because your sensitivity to light really goes up at night.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.480
 And I talked last time about how you can protect

24:05.480 --> 24:10.200
 against that sensitivity by looking at the setting sun

24:10.200 --> 24:12.200
 and watching the evening sun,

24:12.200 --> 24:13.840
 even if it's not crossing the horizon

24:13.840 --> 24:15.320
 around the time of sunset.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.920
 And that's because it adjusts your retinal sensitivity

24:17.920 --> 24:19.120
 and your melatonin pathway

24:19.120 --> 24:22.720
 so that light is not as detrimental to melatonin at night.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.480
 Think about the afternoon sunlight viewing

24:25.480 --> 24:26.760
 as kind of a,

24:26.760 --> 24:29.360
 I think of it as kind of a Netflix inoculation.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.240
 It allows me to watch a little bit of Netflix

24:31.240 --> 24:32.740
 in the evening,

24:32.740 --> 24:33.640
 although it's very hard to watch

24:33.640 --> 24:35.280
 a little bit of anything on Netflix.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.960
 It seems like there's some other neurobiological process

24:37.960 --> 24:39.040
 going on there

24:39.040 --> 24:41.200
 where I have to watch episode after episode

24:41.200 --> 24:42.400
 or after episode.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.460
 But in any case,

24:44.460 --> 24:47.160
 you can protect yourself against some of that

24:47.160 --> 24:49.400
 bad effect of light at night

24:49.400 --> 24:50.700
 by looking at light in the evening.

24:50.700 --> 24:54.120
 It really does adjust down the sensitivity of the system.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.480
 Okay, I want to talk about seasonal changes

24:57.480 --> 25:01.840
 in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.720
 So depending on where you are in the world,

25:03.720 --> 25:05.300
 Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,

25:05.300 --> 25:07.300
 at the equator or closer to the poles,

25:07.300 --> 25:10.680
 the days and nights are going to be different lengths.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.100
 That just makes sense.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.640
 But that translates to real biological signals

25:14.640 --> 25:18.320
 that impact everything from wakefulness and sleep times,

25:18.320 --> 25:21.000
 but also mood and metabolism.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.700
 So here's how this works.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.920
 Now, after seeing the previous episode of the podcast

25:25.920 --> 25:28.700
 and paying attention here,

25:28.700 --> 25:30.400
 you are armed with the knowledge

25:30.400 --> 25:32.960
 to really understand how it is that,

25:32.960 --> 25:33.800
 believe it or not,

25:33.800 --> 25:36.320
 every cell in your body is tuned

25:36.320 --> 25:39.820
 to the movement of the planet relative to the sun.

25:39.820 --> 25:41.360
 So as all of you know,

25:41.360 --> 25:45.080
 the earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.040
 So part of that day we're bathed in sunlight,

25:47.040 --> 25:47.860
 depending on where we are,

25:47.860 --> 25:49.480
 the other half of the day or part of the day,

25:49.480 --> 25:50.800
 we're in darkness.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.960
 The earth also travels around the sun.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.360
 365 days is the time that it takes, one year,

25:57.360 --> 25:58.840
 to travel around that sun.

26:00.460 --> 26:02.040
 The earth is tilted.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.120
 It's not perfectly upright.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.160
 So the earth is tilted on its axis.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.740
 So depending on where we are in that 365 day journey,

26:11.740 --> 26:13.600
 and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere,

26:13.600 --> 26:15.720
 Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,

26:15.720 --> 26:19.200
 some days of the year are longer than others.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.120
 Some are very short, some are very long.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.000
 If you're at the equator,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.080
 you experience less variation in day length

26:25.080 --> 26:26.160
 and therefore night length.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.880
 And if you're closer to the poles,

26:27.880 --> 26:30.720
 you're going to experience some very long days.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.360
 And you're also going to experience some very short days,

26:33.360 --> 26:35.560
 depending on which pole you're at and what time of year

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
 it is.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.880
 The simple way to put this is depending on time of year,

26:38.880 --> 26:41.200
 the days are either getting shorter or getting longer.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.340
 Now, every cell in your body adjusts its biology

26:45.340 --> 26:46.920
 according to day length,

26:47.800 --> 26:51.160
 except your brain, body and cells

26:51.160 --> 26:53.800
 don't actually know anything about day length.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.940
 It only knows night length.

26:55.940 --> 26:57.200
 And here's how it works.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.920
 Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.

26:59.920 --> 27:04.720
 If days are long and getting longer,

27:04.720 --> 27:08.160
 that means melatonin is reduced.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.460
 The total amount of melatonin is less

27:11.460 --> 27:16.080
 because light is more, therefore melatonin is less.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.400
 If days are getting shorter,

27:18.400 --> 27:21.480
 light can't inhibit melatonin as much

27:21.480 --> 27:23.280
 through the summing of photon mechanisms

27:23.280 --> 27:24.960
 that we talked about before.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.800
 And that melatonin signal is getting longer.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.800
 So every cell in your body actually knows external day length

27:32.800 --> 27:34.720
 and therefore time of year

27:34.720 --> 27:37.820
 by way of the duration of the melatonin signal.

27:37.820 --> 27:41.680
 And in general, it's fair to say that in diurnal animals,

27:41.680 --> 27:43.840
 meaning animals like us that tend to be awake

27:43.840 --> 27:46.400
 during the daytime and nocturnal animals,

27:46.400 --> 27:48.020
 which tend to be awake at night,

27:49.220 --> 27:52.680
 the longer the melatonin signal, the more depressed,

27:52.680 --> 27:54.720
 not necessarily clinically depressed,

27:54.720 --> 27:55.720
 although that can happen,

27:55.720 --> 27:59.280
 but the more depressed our systems tend to be.

27:59.280 --> 28:04.280
 Reproduction, metabolism, mood,

28:04.400 --> 28:07.200
 turnover rates of skin cells and hair cells

28:07.200 --> 28:08.840
 all tend to be diminished

28:08.840 --> 28:13.800
 compared to the spring and summer months for some,

28:13.800 --> 28:15.560
 Northern hemisphere spring and summer months,

28:15.560 --> 28:17.880
 or the times in which days are very long

28:17.880 --> 28:19.640
 and there's less melatonin that tends to,

28:19.640 --> 28:22.600
 in almost all animals, including humans,

28:22.600 --> 28:26.560
 more breeding, more hormone elevation of the hormones

28:26.560 --> 28:31.120
 that stimulate breeding reproduction and fertility.

28:31.120 --> 28:36.120
 Metabolism is up, lipid metabolism, fat burning is up,

28:36.320 --> 28:38.100
 protein synthesis is up.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.800
 These things tend to correlate with the seasons.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.280
 Now, some people are very, very strongly tied to the seasons

28:44.280 --> 28:47.240
 they get depressed, clinically depressed in winter

28:47.240 --> 28:51.560
 and light therapies are very useful for those people.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.920
 Some people love the winter and they're happiest in winter

28:53.920 --> 28:55.440
 and they feel kind of depressed in summer,

28:55.440 --> 28:57.600
 although that is far more rare.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.840
 That doesn't mean depression cannot exist in the summer,

28:59.840 --> 29:02.640
 but when we're talking about seasonal depression,

29:02.640 --> 29:04.040
 that tends to be true.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.180
 It's more depression in winter.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.880
 Now there's other things that correlate with seasonality.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.600
 Suicide rates tend to be highest in the spring,

29:12.600 --> 29:13.960
 not in the winter,

29:13.960 --> 29:17.560
 but that has to do with some of the more complicated

29:17.560 --> 29:20.120
 and unfortunately tragic aspects of suicide,

29:20.120 --> 29:22.880
 which is that oftentimes people will commit suicide,

29:22.880 --> 29:26.380
 not at the very depths of their energy levels,

29:26.380 --> 29:29.680
 but as they're emerging from those depths of low energy.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.620
 So we'll talk about suicidality and mood disorders

29:32.620 --> 29:36.000
 in a later podcast season, meaning a month later,

29:36.000 --> 29:40.240
 but for now, just understand that everybody

29:40.240 --> 29:41.800
 is going through these natural fluctuations

29:41.800 --> 29:44.800
 depending on the duration of the melatonin signal.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.440
 Now this might lead you to say,

29:46.440 --> 29:48.640
 well, then I should just really get as much light

29:48.640 --> 29:50.880
 as I can all the time and reduce melatonin

29:50.880 --> 29:51.800
 and feel great all the time.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.000
 Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way

29:53.000 --> 29:56.360
 because melatonin also has important effects

29:56.360 --> 29:57.840
 on the immune system.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.900
 It has important effects on transmitter systems

30:01.900 --> 30:03.840
 in the brain, et cetera.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.820
 So everybody needs to figure out for themselves

30:06.820 --> 30:09.920
 how much light they need early in the day

30:09.920 --> 30:13.080
 and how much light they need to avoid late in the day

30:13.080 --> 30:15.600
 in order to optimize their mood and metabolism.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.520
 There is no one size fits all prescription

30:18.520 --> 30:21.140
 because there is a range of melatonin receptors.

30:21.140 --> 30:25.440
 There are a range of everything from metabolic types

30:25.440 --> 30:29.360
 to genetic histories, family histories, et cetera.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.680
 There is no one size fits all prescription,

30:31.680 --> 30:33.720
 but by understanding that light

30:33.720 --> 30:36.160
 and extended day length inhibit melatonin

30:36.160 --> 30:38.320
 and melatonin tends to be associated

30:38.320 --> 30:40.800
 with a more depressed or reduced functioning

30:40.800 --> 30:43.360
 of these kinds of activity driving

30:43.360 --> 30:46.280
 and mood elevating signals and understanding

30:46.280 --> 30:50.020
 that you have some control over melatonin by way of light,

30:50.020 --> 30:52.340
 including sunlight, but also artificial light,

30:52.340 --> 30:54.200
 that should empower you, I believe,

30:54.200 --> 30:57.040
 to make the adjustments that if you're feeling low,

30:57.040 --> 30:59.920
 you might ask, how much light am I getting?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.520
 When am I getting that light?

31:01.520 --> 31:04.880
 Because sleep is also important for restoring mood, right?

31:04.880 --> 31:05.720
 So you need sleep.

31:05.720 --> 31:09.860
 You can't just crush melatonin across the board

31:09.860 --> 31:11.040
 and expect to feel good

31:11.040 --> 31:12.200
 because then you're not going to fall asleep

31:12.200 --> 31:13.040
 and stay asleep.

31:13.040 --> 31:17.880
 Melatonin not incidentally comes from,

31:17.880 --> 31:20.640
 is synthesized from serotonin.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.720
 Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated

31:23.720 --> 31:27.420
 with feelings of wellbeing provided to proper levels,

31:27.420 --> 31:29.400
 but wellbeing of a particular kind,

31:29.400 --> 31:33.360
 wellbeing associated with quiescence and calm

31:33.360 --> 31:35.800
 and the feeling that we have enough resources

31:35.800 --> 31:38.060
 in our immediate kind of conditions.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.120
 It's the kind of thing that comes from a good meal

31:40.120 --> 31:43.180
 or sitting down with friends or holding a loved one

31:43.180 --> 31:47.700
 or conversing with somebody that you really bond with.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.700
 Serotonin does not stimulate action.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.600
 It tends to stimulate stillness.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.280
 Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine,

31:56.280 --> 31:59.120
 which is a reward, feel good neuromodulator

31:59.120 --> 32:00.680
 that stimulates action.

32:00.680 --> 32:05.680
 And actually dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine,

32:05.780 --> 32:08.280
 to adrenaline, which actually puts us into action.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.400
 It's actually made from dopamine, right?

32:11.400 --> 32:15.000
 So you can start to think about light as a signal

32:15.000 --> 32:17.540
 that is very powerful for modulating things

32:17.540 --> 32:18.600
 like sleep and wakefulness,

32:18.600 --> 32:22.480
 but also serotonin levels, melatonin levels.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.240
 And I talked about this previously,

32:24.240 --> 32:25.080
 but I'll mention once more

32:25.080 --> 32:27.960
 that light in the middle of the night reduces dopamine levels

32:27.960 --> 32:30.480
 to the point where it can start causing problems

32:30.480 --> 32:32.640
 with learning and memory and mood.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.720
 That's one powerful reason to avoid bright light

32:35.720 --> 32:37.560
 in the middle of the night.

32:37.560 --> 32:41.380
 Okay, seasonal rhythms have a number of effects,

32:41.380 --> 32:44.440
 but humans are not purely seasonal breeders.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.920
 Unlike a lot of animals, we breed all year long.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.360
 In fact, there's a preponderance of September babies

32:52.360 --> 32:54.000
 in my life, not actual babies,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.180
 but people that are born in September,

32:55.180 --> 32:58.140
 which means that they were conceived in December.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.120
 Without knowing the details, we can fairly assume that.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.480
 And December, at least in the Northern hemisphere,

33:04.480 --> 33:08.440
 days tend to be shorter and nights tend to be longer.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.860
 So clearly humans aren't seasonal breeders,

33:10.860 --> 33:14.160
 but there are shifts in breeding and fertility

33:14.160 --> 33:15.200
 that exist in humans,

33:15.200 --> 33:17.660
 but also much more strongly in other animals.

33:17.660 --> 33:19.240
 So seasonal effects vary.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.320
 Some of you will experience very strong seasonal effects.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.980
 Others of you will not.

33:22.980 --> 33:25.520
 I think everybody should be taking care

33:25.520 --> 33:29.000
 to get adequate sunlight and to avoid bright light at night

33:29.000 --> 33:31.020
 throughout the year, if possible.

33:31.020 --> 33:34.920
 Throughout this podcast and in previous episodes,

33:34.920 --> 33:36.740
 I've been mentioning neuromodulators,

33:36.740 --> 33:39.300
 things like serotonin and dopamine,

33:39.300 --> 33:42.320
 which tend to bias certain brain circuits

33:42.320 --> 33:43.960
 and things in our body to happen

33:43.960 --> 33:45.700
 and certain brain circuits and things in our body

33:45.700 --> 33:47.300
 not to happen.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.000
 One of the ones I've mentioned numerous times is epinephrine,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.020
 which is a neuromodulator that tends to put us into action,

33:53.020 --> 33:54.500
 make us want to move.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.420
 In fact, when it's released in high amounts

33:56.420 --> 33:59.180
 in our brain and body, it can lead to what we call stress

33:59.180 --> 34:00.940
 or the feeling of being stressed.

34:01.820 --> 34:02.840
 Several people asked me,

34:02.840 --> 34:06.320
 what's the difference between epinephrine and adrenaline?

34:06.320 --> 34:08.900
 Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands,

34:08.900 --> 34:10.860
 which sit right above our kidneys.

34:10.860 --> 34:14.100
 Epinephrine is the exact same molecule,

34:14.100 --> 34:16.660
 except that it's released within the brain.

34:16.660 --> 34:18.460
 And so people use these phrases

34:18.460 --> 34:20.980
 or these words rather interchangeably.

34:20.980 --> 34:24.700
 Epi means near or on top of sometimes

34:24.700 --> 34:29.180
 and any time you see nephron, it means kidney.

34:29.180 --> 34:30.260
 So it means near the kidney.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.280
 So epinephrine actually means near the kidney.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.600
 So it was used originally to describe adrenaline,

34:35.600 --> 34:38.380
 but epinephrine and adrenaline are basically the same thing

34:38.380 --> 34:40.620
 and they tend to stimulate agitation

34:40.620 --> 34:42.480
 and the desire to move.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.500
 That's what that's about.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.540
 Which brings us to the topic of exercise.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.920
 Got a lot of questions about exercise.

34:49.920 --> 34:53.580
 What forms of exercise are best for sleeping well?

34:53.580 --> 34:55.520
 When should I exercise, et cetera?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.740
 There's a lot of individual variability around this,

34:59.740 --> 35:04.300
 but I can talk about what I know from the science literature

35:04.300 --> 35:06.180
 and what I happen to do myself.

35:07.220 --> 35:09.260
 There are basically two forms of exercise

35:09.260 --> 35:10.080
 that we can talk about.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.140
 Although, of course, I realize

35:11.140 --> 35:13.100
 there are many different forms of exercise.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.360
 There's much more nuance to this,

35:14.360 --> 35:16.580
 but we can talk about cardiovascular exercise

35:16.580 --> 35:18.620
 where the idea is to repeat a movement

35:18.620 --> 35:20.140
 over and over and over continuously.

35:20.140 --> 35:21.980
 So that'd be like running, biking, rowing,

35:21.980 --> 35:24.000
 the cycling, this kind of thing.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.940
 Or there's a resistance exercise

35:26.940 --> 35:29.360
 where you're moving, lifting,

35:29.360 --> 35:31.620
 presumably putting down also.

35:31.620 --> 35:34.960
 Things of progressively heavier and heavier weight

35:34.960 --> 35:38.200
 that you couldn't do continuously for 30 minutes.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.340
 So cardiovascular exercise

35:42.340 --> 35:44.520
 is typically the more aerobic type exercise

35:44.520 --> 35:46.080
 and resistance exercise, of course,

35:46.080 --> 35:47.660
 is the more anaerobic type exercise.

35:47.660 --> 35:50.020
 And yes, there's variation between the two.

35:50.020 --> 35:54.260
 Most studies of exercise have looked at aerobic exercise

35:54.260 --> 35:56.080
 because that's basically the thing

35:56.080 --> 35:58.240
 that you can get a rat or a mouse to do.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.820
 You know what's really weird about rats and mice?

35:59.820 --> 36:02.700
 They like to run on wheels so much

36:02.700 --> 36:04.060
 that someone actually did this study.

36:04.060 --> 36:05.060
 It was published in Science.

36:05.060 --> 36:07.220
 They put a wheel, a running wheel,

36:07.220 --> 36:08.460
 in the middle of a field

36:08.460 --> 36:11.900
 and mice ran to that wheel and ran on the wheel.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.940
 It turns out that what they like

36:14.940 --> 36:17.700
 is the passage of the visual image of the bars

36:17.700 --> 36:19.140
 in front of their face,

36:19.140 --> 36:23.640
 which I find kind of remarkable and troubling

36:23.640 --> 36:25.400
 because it seems so like trivial.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.760
 But anyway, they love aerobic exercise.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.620
 And so most of the studies were done on these mice

36:29.620 --> 36:30.660
 that love running on wheels.

36:30.660 --> 36:35.140
 Whereas so far, it's been challenging to find conditions

36:35.140 --> 36:37.080
 in which mice really like to lift weights

36:37.080 --> 36:38.840
 or will do it in a laboratory.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.180
 So any weight-bearing exercise studies

36:41.180 --> 36:43.000
 really have to be done in humans.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.660
 And since humans are what we're interested in,

36:46.660 --> 36:50.260
 there are some studies looking at these two things

36:50.260 --> 36:52.000
 and when they tend to work best.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.260
 Now you will see some places aerobic exercise

36:54.260 --> 36:55.360
 is best done in the morning

36:55.360 --> 36:57.840
 and weight training is best done in the afternoon.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.900
 I think there's far more individual variation than that.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.820
 I think there are, however,

37:03.820 --> 37:06.740
 a couple of windows that the exercise science literature

37:06.740 --> 37:08.800
 and the circadian literature points to

37:08.800 --> 37:11.540
 as windows related to body temperature

37:11.540 --> 37:14.420
 in which performance, injury,

37:14.420 --> 37:17.180
 in which performance is optimized,

37:17.180 --> 37:20.260
 injury is reduced and so on.

37:20.260 --> 37:23.780
 And those tend to be 30 minutes after waking.

37:23.780 --> 37:24.980
 And that probably correlates

37:24.980 --> 37:27.900
 with the inflection in cortisol associated with waking,

37:27.900 --> 37:29.860
 whether or not you've gotten light or not.

37:29.860 --> 37:31.500
 Three hours after waking,

37:31.500 --> 37:34.320
 which probably correlates to the rise in body temperature,

37:34.320 --> 37:36.080
 sometime right around waking.

37:36.080 --> 37:40.260
 And the later afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking,

37:40.260 --> 37:42.740
 which is when temperature tends to peak.

37:42.740 --> 37:45.100
 So some people like to exercise in the morning.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.620
 Some people like to exercise in the afternoon.

37:46.620 --> 37:48.160
 It really depends.

37:48.160 --> 37:51.260
 I think for those of us with very busy schedules,

37:51.260 --> 37:55.860
 it's advantageous to be able to do your training

37:55.860 --> 37:58.480
 whenever you have the opportunity to do it,

37:58.480 --> 38:01.500
 unless you can really control your schedule.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.860
 And so I would never want these recommendations

38:04.860 --> 38:06.020
 to seem like recommendations.

38:06.020 --> 38:07.740
 What I'm really describing is some opportunities

38:07.740 --> 38:09.580
 30 minutes after waking,

38:09.580 --> 38:13.220
 three hours after waking or 11 hours after waking

38:13.220 --> 38:14.940
 has been shown at least in some studies

38:14.940 --> 38:17.520
 to optimize performance, reduce injury

38:17.520 --> 38:18.700
 and that sort of thing.

38:18.700 --> 38:21.340
 But you really have to figure out what works for you.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.960
 A note about working out first thing in the morning.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.380
 Last time we talked about non-photic phase shifts.

38:26.380 --> 38:29.240
 If you exercise first thing in the morning,

38:29.240 --> 38:32.460
 your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit.

38:32.460 --> 38:35.140
 There's actually plasticity in these circadian circuits

38:35.140 --> 38:37.640
 that will lead you to want to wake up

38:37.640 --> 38:39.980
 at the particular time that you exercised the previous

38:39.980 --> 38:41.040
 three or four days.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.620
 So that can be a powerful tool,

38:42.620 --> 38:44.700
 but you still want to get light exposure

38:44.700 --> 38:48.020
 because it turns out that light and exercise converge

38:48.020 --> 38:52.260
 to give an even bigger wake up signal to the brain and body.

38:52.260 --> 38:54.040
 So you might want to think about that.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.280
 Some people find if they exercise late in the day,

38:56.280 --> 38:57.920
 they have trouble sleeping.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.880
 In general, intense exercise does that.

39:01.880 --> 39:05.000
 Whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise doesn't.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.020
 I found some interesting literature

39:07.020 --> 39:09.220
 that talked about sleep need and exercise.

39:09.220 --> 39:14.220
 I found this fascinating that if one is waking,

39:14.380 --> 39:18.140
 not feeling rested and recovered from,

39:18.140 --> 39:21.820
 and yet sleeping the same amount that they typically have,

39:21.820 --> 39:24.900
 it's quite possible that the intensity of exercise

39:24.900 --> 39:27.380
 in the preceding two or three days is too high.

39:27.380 --> 39:31.600
 Whereas if one can't recover,

39:31.600 --> 39:33.340
 no matter how much sleep they get,

39:33.340 --> 39:35.140
 they're just sleepy all the time,

39:35.140 --> 39:36.780
 I realize these things are correlated,

39:36.780 --> 39:39.420
 that the volume of training might be too high.

39:39.420 --> 39:40.880
 Now, I'm not an exercise scientist.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.380
 We should probably get Andy Galpin or somebody else on here

39:43.380 --> 39:46.140
 who's really an expert in this kind of stuff.

39:46.140 --> 39:48.740
 I do realize as soon as anyone talks about exercise

39:48.740 --> 39:49.800
 or nutrition publicly,

39:49.800 --> 39:51.800
 they're basically opening themselves up

39:51.800 --> 39:53.880
 to all sorts of challenges

39:53.880 --> 39:56.020
 because you can basically find support

39:56.020 --> 39:59.060
 for almost any protocol in the literature.

39:59.060 --> 40:02.540
 What I've looked at was two journals in particular,

40:02.540 --> 40:04.380
 International Journal of Chronobiology

40:04.380 --> 40:08.760
 and Journal Biological Rhythms, excuse me,

40:08.760 --> 40:12.180
 to assess these parameters

40:12.180 --> 40:14.420
 that I mentioned just a moment ago,

40:14.420 --> 40:16.460
 because the studies tended to be done in humans.

40:16.460 --> 40:17.540
 They were fairly recent

40:17.540 --> 40:20.900
 and they came from groups that I recognized

40:20.900 --> 40:24.660
 as well as knowing that those journals are peer reviewed.

40:24.660 --> 40:27.500
 Many of your questions were about neuroplasticity,

40:27.500 --> 40:30.380
 which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change

40:30.380 --> 40:32.020
 in response to experience.

40:32.020 --> 40:35.400
 There was a question that asked whether or not

40:35.400 --> 40:37.880
 these really deep biological mechanisms

40:37.880 --> 40:41.360
 around wakefulness, time of waking, sleep, et cetera,

40:41.360 --> 40:44.780
 were subject to neuroplasticity, and indeed they are.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.640
 Some of that plasticity is short-term

40:46.640 --> 40:48.960
 and some of it is more long-term.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.280
 There's a really good analogy here,

40:50.280 --> 40:55.280
 which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule

40:55.560 --> 41:00.080
 where every day, say at 8 a.m., noon and 7 p.m.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.240
 is when you eat your food,

41:01.240 --> 41:02.160
 not suggesting you do this,

41:02.160 --> 41:05.440
 but let's say you were to do that for a couple of days.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.760
 After a few days,

41:06.760 --> 41:09.160
 you would start to anticipate those mealtimes

41:09.160 --> 41:12.280
 where no matter where you were in the world,

41:12.280 --> 41:13.760
 no matter what was going on in your life,

41:13.760 --> 41:17.040
 about five to 10 minutes before those mealtimes,

41:17.040 --> 41:19.940
 you would start to feel hungry and even a little agitated,

41:19.940 --> 41:21.840
 which is your body's way

41:21.840 --> 41:24.040
 of trying to get you to forage for food.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.640
 And that's because of some peptide signals

41:26.640 --> 41:29.220
 that come from the periphery from your body,

41:29.220 --> 41:32.120
 things like hypocretinorexin

41:32.120 --> 41:34.720
 that signal to the hypothalamus and brainstem

41:34.720 --> 41:36.060
 to make you active and alert

41:36.060 --> 41:38.440
 and look for food and feel hungry.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.040
 So there's kind of an anticipatory circuit

41:41.040 --> 41:42.180
 that's a chemical circuit,

41:42.180 --> 41:46.240
 but eventually over time, the neurons, the neural circuits

41:46.240 --> 41:47.840
 that control hypocretinorexin

41:47.840 --> 41:50.320
 would get tuned to the neural circuits

41:50.320 --> 41:55.020
 that are involved in eating and maybe even smell and taste

41:55.020 --> 41:56.920
 to create a kind of eating circuit

41:56.920 --> 42:00.380
 that's unique to your pattern, to your rhythms.

42:00.380 --> 42:04.080
 The same thing is true for these waking and exercise

42:04.080 --> 42:06.740
 and other schedules, including ultradian schedules.

42:06.740 --> 42:08.720
 If you wake up in the morning

42:08.720 --> 42:09.880
 and start getting your sunlight,

42:09.880 --> 42:12.160
 you start exercising in the morning

42:12.160 --> 42:14.160
 or you exercise in the afternoon,

42:14.160 --> 42:16.320
 pretty soon your body will start to anticipate that

42:16.320 --> 42:19.020
 and start to secrete hormones and other signals

42:19.020 --> 42:22.300
 that prepare your body for the ensuing activity

42:22.300 --> 42:24.320
 of waking up or going to sleep.

42:24.320 --> 42:28.020
 So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,

42:28.020 --> 42:30.860
 even if that rhythm isn't down to the minute,

42:30.860 --> 42:33.140
 you'll find that there's plasticity in these circuits

42:33.140 --> 42:35.800
 and it becomes easier to wake up early if that's your thing

42:35.800 --> 42:39.160
 or exercise at a particular day if that's your thing.

42:39.160 --> 42:42.180
 That's the beauty of neuroplasticity.

42:42.180 --> 42:43.320
 A number of people asked,

42:43.320 --> 42:45.980
 what can I do to increase plasticity?

42:45.980 --> 42:48.260
 And that really comes in two forms.

42:48.260 --> 42:51.920
 There's plasticity that we can access in sleep

42:51.920 --> 42:56.140
 to improve rates of learning and depth of learning

42:56.140 --> 42:58.040
 from the previous day or so.

42:58.040 --> 43:01.340
 And there's this NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

43:01.340 --> 43:03.020
 that can be done without sleeping

43:03.020 --> 43:04.980
 to improve rates of learning

43:04.980 --> 43:06.500
 and depth of retention, et cetera.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.580
 So let's consider those both

43:08.580 --> 43:10.820
 and you can incorporate these protocols if you like.

43:10.820 --> 43:14.640
 Again, these are based on quality peer-reviewed studies.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.260
 First, let's talk about learning in sleep.

43:17.260 --> 43:20.080
 This is based on some work that I'll provide the reference

43:20.080 --> 43:23.660
 for that was published in the journal Science.

43:23.660 --> 43:24.540
 Excellent journal.

43:24.540 --> 43:27.340
 Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies

43:27.340 --> 43:30.860
 done by others in his book, Why We Sleep.

43:30.860 --> 43:32.620
 The studies, just to remind you,

43:32.620 --> 43:34.740
 are structured the following way.

43:34.740 --> 43:38.260
 An individual is brought into a laboratory,

43:38.260 --> 43:39.900
 does a spatial memory task.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.820
 So there tends to be a screen

43:42.820 --> 43:45.480
 with a bunch of different objects popping up on the screen

43:45.480 --> 43:46.420
 in different locations.

43:46.420 --> 43:48.020
 So it might be a bulldog's face,

43:48.020 --> 43:50.040
 there might be a cat, then it might be an apple,

43:50.040 --> 43:52.220
 then it might be a pen in different locations.

43:52.220 --> 43:53.980
 And that sounds trivially easy,

43:53.980 --> 43:56.660
 but with time you can imagine it gets pretty tough

43:56.660 --> 43:58.660
 to come back a day later and remember

43:58.660 --> 44:01.100
 if something presented in a given location

44:01.100 --> 44:02.560
 was something you've seen before

44:02.560 --> 44:04.360
 and whether or not it was presented in that location

44:04.360 --> 44:05.340
 or a different location.

44:05.340 --> 44:08.060
 If you had enough objects and change the locations enough,

44:08.060 --> 44:10.180
 this can actually be quite difficult.

44:10.180 --> 44:14.180
 In this study, subjects either just went through

44:14.180 --> 44:19.180
 the experiment or a particular odor was released

44:19.180 --> 44:21.560
 into the room while they were learning,

44:21.560 --> 44:25.040
 or a tone was played in the room while they were learning.

44:25.040 --> 44:28.840
 And then during the sleep of those subjects

44:28.840 --> 44:31.600
 the following night and the following night,

44:31.600 --> 44:35.280
 this was done repeatedly for several nights,

44:35.280 --> 44:38.920
 the same odor or tone was played

44:38.920 --> 44:40.880
 while the subjects were sleeping.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.480
 They did this in different stages of sleep,

44:43.480 --> 44:46.720
 non-REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep.

44:46.720 --> 44:50.520
 They did this with just the tone in sleep

44:50.520 --> 44:54.000
 if the subjects had had the odor, but not the tone,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.500
 they did it with putting the tone,

44:56.500 --> 44:58.260
 if they had had the odor while learning.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.480
 So basically all the controls,

44:59.480 --> 45:01.040
 all the things you'd want to see done

45:01.040 --> 45:03.200
 to make sure that it wasn't some indirect effect,

45:03.200 --> 45:05.460
 some modulatory effect, okay?

45:05.460 --> 45:10.460
 And what they found was that providing the same stimulus,

45:10.600 --> 45:13.540
 the odor if they smelled an odor or a tone

45:13.540 --> 45:16.500
 if the subjects heard a tone while learning,

45:16.500 --> 45:19.040
 if they just delivered that odor or tone

45:19.040 --> 45:21.040
 while the subjects slept,

45:21.040 --> 45:23.520
 rates of learning and retention of information

45:23.520 --> 45:26.200
 was significantly greater.

45:26.200 --> 45:27.120
 This is pretty cool.

45:27.120 --> 45:30.360
 What this means that you can cue the subconscious brain,

45:30.360 --> 45:34.520
 the asleep brain to learn particular things better

45:34.520 --> 45:35.860
 and faster.

45:35.860 --> 45:37.180
 So how might you implement this?

45:37.180 --> 45:39.400
 Well, you could play with this if you want,

45:39.400 --> 45:41.040
 I don't see any real challenge to this

45:41.040 --> 45:45.040
 provided the odor is a safe one and it doesn't wake you up

45:45.040 --> 45:49.120
 and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up.

45:49.120 --> 45:52.100
 You could do this by having a metronome for instance,

45:52.100 --> 45:53.520
 while learning something,

45:53.520 --> 45:55.400
 playing in the background or particular music

45:55.400 --> 45:58.060
 and then have that very faintly while you sleep.

45:58.060 --> 46:01.100
 So you could apply this if you like and try this.

46:01.100 --> 46:02.680
 There are a number of groups,

46:02.680 --> 46:05.440
 I think now that are trying this using tactile stimulation.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.320
 So slight vibration on the wrist during learning

46:08.320 --> 46:10.860
 and then the same vibration on the wrist during sleep.

46:10.860 --> 46:14.340
 It does not appear that the sensory modality,

46:14.340 --> 46:17.520
 whether or not it's odor or auditory tone

46:17.520 --> 46:21.480
 or tactile stimulation, somatosensory stimulation,

46:21.480 --> 46:22.840
 whether or not it matters.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.600
 It's remarkable because it really shows

46:24.600 --> 46:26.840
 that sleep is an extension of the waking state.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.320
 We've known that for a long time,

46:28.320 --> 46:30.620
 but this really tethers those two

46:30.620 --> 46:33.360
 in a very meaningful and actionable way.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.160
 So I think I'll report back to you

46:35.160 --> 46:36.500
 as I learn more about these studies,

46:36.500 --> 46:39.100
 but that's what I know about them at this point.

46:39.100 --> 46:39.940
 As long as we're there,

46:39.940 --> 46:41.080
 we might as well talk about dreaming

46:41.080 --> 46:43.420
 because I got so many questions about dreams.

46:43.420 --> 46:46.180
 A couple of people want to ask me what their dreams meant.

46:46.180 --> 46:49.080
 Look, I don't even know what my dreams mean half the time.

46:50.160 --> 46:53.760
 I occasionally will wake up from a dream and remember it.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.600
 If you want to remember your dreams better,

46:55.600 --> 46:57.700
 if you're somebody who has challenges

46:57.700 --> 46:58.560
 remembering your dreams,

46:58.560 --> 47:00.880
 you can set your alarm so that you wake up

47:00.880 --> 47:02.880
 in the middle of one of these 90 minute cycles,

47:02.880 --> 47:04.760
 which toward morning tend to be occupied

47:04.760 --> 47:06.460
 almost exclusively by REM sleep.

47:06.460 --> 47:07.480
 Remember early in the night,

47:07.480 --> 47:10.120
 you have less REM sleep than later in the night,

47:10.120 --> 47:12.800
 but you want to get as much sleep as you can

47:12.800 --> 47:13.640
 because that's healthy.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.900
 So I don't know that you want to wake yourself up.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.300
 Some people find that writing down their thoughts

47:18.300 --> 47:19.920
 immediately first thing in the morning

47:19.920 --> 47:23.000
 allows them to later spontaneously remember

47:23.000 --> 47:24.300
 their dream they had.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.040
 There's some literature on that.

47:26.040 --> 47:28.580
 The meaning of dreams is a little bit controversial.

47:28.580 --> 47:30.160
 Some people believe they have strong meaning.

47:30.160 --> 47:33.360
 Other people believe that they can be

47:33.360 --> 47:35.200
 just spontaneous firing of neurons

47:35.200 --> 47:38.840
 that were active in the waking state

47:39.760 --> 47:40.640
 and don't have any meaning.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.920
 There are good data to show that when you learn spatial,

47:44.880 --> 47:46.100
 new spatial environments,

47:46.100 --> 47:48.780
 that there's a replay of those environments,

47:48.780 --> 47:51.600
 so-called place cells that fire in your brain

47:51.600 --> 47:53.560
 only when you enter a particular environment,

47:53.560 --> 47:55.320
 that those are replayed in sleep

47:55.320 --> 47:57.800
 in almost direct fashion to the way that

47:58.760 --> 48:00.520
 things were activated

48:00.520 --> 48:02.480
 when you were learning that spatial task.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.080
 Dreams are fascinating.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.940
 We're paralyzed during dreams,

48:05.940 --> 48:07.760
 which brings us to another question.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.800
 Somebody asked about sleep paralysis.

48:10.800 --> 48:14.680
 We are paralyzed for much of our sleep, so-called atonia,

48:14.680 --> 48:16.840
 presumably so we don't act out our dreams.

48:16.840 --> 48:20.400
 Some people wake up and they're still paralyzed.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.200
 I've actually had this happen to me,

48:22.200 --> 48:23.880
 not very many times, but a few times,

48:23.880 --> 48:25.640
 and then they jolt themselves awake.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.360
 And it actually is quite terrifying,

48:27.360 --> 48:28.600
 I can say from personal experience,

48:28.600 --> 48:30.280
 to wake up, be wide awake,

48:30.280 --> 48:33.200
 and you cannot move your body at all.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.840
 It's really quite frightening.

48:34.840 --> 48:35.680
 There are a couple of things

48:35.680 --> 48:39.160
 that will increase the intrusion of atonia

48:39.160 --> 48:40.520
 into the wakeful state,

48:40.520 --> 48:42.560
 which is essentially means you're waking up,

48:42.560 --> 48:44.460
 but you can't move.

48:44.460 --> 48:46.320
 One is marijuana, THC.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.640
 I'm not a marijuana smoker.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.680
 I'm not a cop, or I don't know the legality where you live,

48:51.680 --> 48:53.760
 so I'm not saying one thing or another about marijuana.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.060
 I'm just, the fact that I had that experience

48:57.060 --> 49:00.320
 without marijuana means that it can happen regardless.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.920
 But marijuana smokers, for whatever reason,

49:02.920 --> 49:06.120
 maybe it has something to do with the cannabinoid receptors

49:06.120 --> 49:08.200
 or the serotonin receptors downstream

49:08.200 --> 49:11.480
 of the motor pathways, I don't know.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.000
 I couldn't find any literature on this,

49:13.000 --> 49:16.080
 but marijuana smokers report higher frequency

49:16.080 --> 49:19.540
 of this kind of paralysis and wakefulness

49:19.540 --> 49:21.900
 as you transition from sleep to wakefulness.

49:21.900 --> 49:23.520
 I suppose probably one could learn

49:23.520 --> 49:24.680
 to get comfortable with it.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.160
 For me, it was terrifying

49:26.160 --> 49:27.360
 because I'm just used to being able

49:27.360 --> 49:28.560
 to move my limbs, fortunately,

49:28.560 --> 49:30.340
 and I wasn't able to.

49:30.340 --> 49:35.340
 And it's quite a thing, let me tell you.

49:36.240 --> 49:39.760
 Okay, some other questions about neuroplasticity.

49:39.760 --> 49:42.760
 So the other form of neuroplasticity

49:42.760 --> 49:45.920
 is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying

49:45.920 --> 49:50.460
 by listening to tones or smelling odors in sleep,

49:50.460 --> 49:52.140
 but the neuroplasticity that you can access

49:52.140 --> 49:54.160
 with non-sleep deep rest.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.200
 So NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

49:57.200 --> 49:59.360
 as well as short 20-minute naps,

49:59.360 --> 50:01.520
 which are very close to non-sleep deep rest

50:01.520 --> 50:04.200
 because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep

50:04.200 --> 50:07.000
 during short naps, unless they're very sleep deprived.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.900
 NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning

50:12.900 --> 50:14.960
 when done for 20-minute bouts

50:16.520 --> 50:20.400
 to match an approximately 90-minute bout of learning.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.680
 So what am I talking about?

50:21.680 --> 50:24.760
 90-minute cycles are these ultradian cycles

50:24.760 --> 50:26.380
 that I've talked about previously.

50:26.380 --> 50:28.600
 And we tend to learn very well

50:28.600 --> 50:30.480
 by taking a 90-minute cycle,

50:30.480 --> 50:33.500
 transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle

50:33.500 --> 50:34.340
 when it's hard to focus,

50:34.340 --> 50:37.160
 and then deep focus and learning

50:37.160 --> 50:39.300
 feels almost like agitation and strain.

50:39.300 --> 50:41.600
 And then by the end of that 90-minute cycle,

50:41.600 --> 50:44.700
 it becomes very hard to maintain focus

50:44.700 --> 50:46.660
 and learn more information.

50:46.660 --> 50:49.000
 There's a study published in Cell Reports last year,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.880
 great journal, excellent paper,

50:51.880 --> 50:56.260
 showing that 20-minute naps or light sleep

50:56.260 --> 50:58.000
 of a sort of non-sleep deep rest

50:58.000 --> 51:01.080
 taken immediately after or close to,

51:01.080 --> 51:02.200
 it doesn't have to be immediately

51:02.200 --> 51:04.120
 after you finish the last sentence of learning

51:04.120 --> 51:07.080
 or whatever it is or bar of music.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.600
 But a couple of minutes after,

51:08.600 --> 51:11.920
 transitioning to a period of non-sleep deep rest

51:11.920 --> 51:14.480
 where you're turning off the analysis of duration,

51:14.480 --> 51:17.400
 path, and outcome has been shown to accelerate learning

51:17.400 --> 51:19.000
 to a significant degree,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.720
 both the amount of information

51:20.720 --> 51:22.680
 and the retention of that information.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.680
 So that's pretty cool because this is a cost-free,

51:27.680 --> 51:30.420
 drug-free way of accelerating learning

51:30.420 --> 51:32.560
 without having to get more sleep,

51:32.560 --> 51:35.640
 but simply by introducing these 20-minute bouts.

51:35.640 --> 51:37.680
 I would encourage people if they want to try this

51:37.680 --> 51:41.240
 to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes

51:41.240 --> 51:42.880
 of ultradian learning cycle.

51:42.880 --> 51:43.720
 There you're incorporating

51:43.720 --> 51:47.400
 a number of different neuroscience-backed tools,

51:47.400 --> 51:50.080
 90-minute cycles for focused learning,

51:50.080 --> 51:51.600
 it could be motor, it could be cognitive,

51:51.600 --> 51:53.440
 it could be musical, whatever,

51:53.440 --> 51:56.120
 and then transition to a 20-minute

51:56.120 --> 51:58.280
 non-sleep deep rest protocol.

51:58.280 --> 52:00.480
 Just want to cue you the fact that in last episode

52:00.480 --> 52:02.040
 in the caption on YouTube,

52:02.040 --> 52:04.280
 we provided links to two different

52:04.280 --> 52:06.400
 yoga nidra non-sleep deep rest protocols

52:06.400 --> 52:08.840
 as well as hypnosis protocols that are clinically backed

52:08.840 --> 52:10.600
 from my colleague David Spiegel

52:10.600 --> 52:14.480
 at Stanford Psychiatry Department.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.500
 All those resources are free.

52:16.500 --> 52:20.520
 There are also a lot of other hypnosis scripts out there.

52:20.520 --> 52:23.800
 I like the ones from Michael Sealy, S-E-A-L.

52:23.800 --> 52:26.280
 I think it's E-Y, although maybe it's just L-Y.

52:26.280 --> 52:28.080
 You can find them easily on YouTube.

52:28.080 --> 52:31.280
 Clinical hypnosis scripts, meaning not staged hypnosis.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.560
 They're not designed to get you to do anything.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.960
 In fact, they're just designed

52:34.960 --> 52:37.280
 to help rewire your brain circuitry.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.580
 Now, how does hypnosis work that way?

52:39.580 --> 52:40.820
 This has a lot to do with sleep

52:40.820 --> 52:43.080
 because it engages neuroplasticity

52:43.080 --> 52:44.480
 by bringing together two things

52:44.480 --> 52:46.360
 that normally are separate from one another.

52:46.360 --> 52:49.200
 One is the alert focused wakeful state

52:49.200 --> 52:50.760
 where you activate the learning.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.440
 And then there's the deep rest

52:52.440 --> 52:55.400
 where the actual reconfiguration of the neurons

52:55.400 --> 52:57.120
 and synapses takes place.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.300
 Hypnosis brings both the focus and the deep rest component

53:01.300 --> 53:03.980
 into the same compartment of time.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.920
 It's a very unique state in that way.

53:05.920 --> 53:10.000
 So hypnosis kind of maximizes the learning bout

53:10.000 --> 53:13.040
 and the non-sleep deep rest bout and combines them.

53:13.040 --> 53:16.000
 But of course that requires some guidance

53:16.000 --> 53:17.620
 from a script or from a hypnotist,

53:17.620 --> 53:20.020
 clinically trained hypnotist,

53:20.020 --> 53:23.000
 and it becomes hard to acquire detailed information.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.960
 It's more about shifts in state like fear to states of calm

53:27.960 --> 53:32.880
 or smoking to quitting smoking,

53:32.880 --> 53:36.040
 anxiety around a trauma to release of anxiety

53:36.040 --> 53:38.420
 around a trauma rather than specific information

53:38.420 --> 53:40.420
 learned in hypnosis, okay?

53:40.420 --> 53:43.000
 So hypnosis seems more about modulating the circuits

53:43.000 --> 53:46.440
 that underlie state as opposed to specific information.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.680
 Although I would not be surprised

53:48.680 --> 53:50.300
 if there weren't certain forms of hypnosis

53:50.300 --> 53:52.120
 that could increase retention

53:52.120 --> 53:53.520
 and learning of specific information,

53:53.520 --> 53:57.540
 but I'm not aware of any of those protocols out there yet.

53:57.540 --> 54:00.040
 Which brings us to the next thing about learning

54:00.040 --> 54:04.000
 and plasticity, which is nootropics, AKA smart drugs.

54:05.740 --> 54:10.080
 This is a big topic that Sai was a Sai of concern

54:10.080 --> 54:14.040
 about how to address nootropics in a thorough enough

54:14.040 --> 54:15.960
 but thoughtful enough way.

54:15.960 --> 54:19.100
 Look, I have a lot of thoughts about nootropics.

54:19.100 --> 54:22.640
 First of all, it means smart drugs, I believe.

54:22.640 --> 54:23.940
 And I don't like that phrase

54:23.940 --> 54:25.840
 because let's just take a step back

54:25.840 --> 54:28.360
 and think about exercise.

54:28.360 --> 54:31.160
 Here you say, I want to be more physically fit.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.200
 What does that mean?

54:32.200 --> 54:34.400
 Does it mean, I would ask for more specificity.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.440
 I'd say, do you want to be stronger?

54:36.440 --> 54:39.320
 Okay, maybe you need to lift heavier objects progressively.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.280
 Do you want more endurance?

54:41.280 --> 54:43.200
 Very different protocol to access endurance.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.360
 Do you want flexibility?

54:44.360 --> 54:46.920
 Do you want explosiveness or suppleness?

54:46.920 --> 54:49.640
 Huge range of things that we call physical fitness.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.660
 Maybe you want all of those.

54:51.660 --> 54:54.740
 If we were talking about emotional fitness,

54:54.740 --> 54:58.320
 we would say, well, an ability to feel empathy,

54:58.320 --> 55:00.460
 but probably also to disengage from empathy

55:00.460 --> 55:01.500
 because you don't want to be tethered

55:01.500 --> 55:02.960
 to other people's emotions all the time.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.960
 That's not healthy either.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.080
 You would think about being able

55:07.080 --> 55:09.120
 to access a range of emotions,

55:09.120 --> 55:13.060
 but for some people their range into the sadness regime

55:13.060 --> 55:14.560
 is really quite vast,

55:14.560 --> 55:16.320
 but their range into the happiness regime

55:16.320 --> 55:17.280
 might be kind of limited.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.240
 For other people who are in a manic state,

55:19.240 --> 55:21.200
 it might be they can access all the happy stuff,

55:21.200 --> 55:22.940
 but not the sadder stuff.

55:22.940 --> 55:27.320
 So I'm speaking by way of analogy here,

55:27.320 --> 55:32.320
 but if we say, we're talking about cognitive abilities,

55:33.380 --> 55:38.000
 we have to ask, okay, creativity, memory.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.940
 We tend to associate intelligence with memory.

55:40.940 --> 55:43.340
 I think this goes back to like spelling bees or something,

55:43.340 --> 55:45.440
 the ability to retain a lot of information

55:46.400 --> 55:48.460
 and just regurgitate information,

55:48.460 --> 55:51.620
 which will get you some distance in some disciplines of life

55:51.620 --> 55:53.460
 but it won't allow you creative thinking.

55:53.460 --> 55:55.640
 It's necessary for creative thinking.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.800
 You need a knowledge base, right?

55:57.800 --> 55:59.600
 You can't just look up everything on Google

55:59.600 --> 56:03.800
 despite what certain educators or so-called educators say.

56:03.800 --> 56:07.220
 You need a database so that you have the raw materials

56:07.220 --> 56:08.400
 with which to be creative.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.480
 So necessary to have memory, but not sufficient

56:11.480 --> 56:13.000
 to be creative, right?

56:13.000 --> 56:16.280
 The creative could have a poor memory for certain things,

56:16.280 --> 56:17.760
 but certainly not for everything.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.280
 They can't have anterograde and retrograde amnesia.

56:20.280 --> 56:23.620
 They'd be like the goldfish that every time around the tank,

56:23.620 --> 56:25.680
 it can't remember where it's at.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.120
 I actually don't know that they've ever done

56:27.120 --> 56:29.060
 that experiment by the way, but you know,

56:29.060 --> 56:32.240
 so no disrespect to goldfish, but you know.

56:32.240 --> 56:34.360
 So you get the idea, you've got creativity,

56:34.360 --> 56:37.780
 you have memory, you have the ability to task switch, right?

56:37.780 --> 56:41.840
 You have the ability to strategy develop

56:41.840 --> 56:43.040
 and strategy implement.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.840
 So the problem I have with the concept of a nootropic

56:45.840 --> 56:47.720
 or a smart drug is it's not specific

56:47.720 --> 56:52.660
 as to what cognitive algorithm you're trying to engage.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.560
 We need more specificity.

56:54.560 --> 56:57.120
 That said, there are elements to learning

56:57.120 --> 57:00.360
 that we've discussed here before that are very concrete.

57:00.360 --> 57:04.000
 Things like the ability to focus and put the blinders

57:04.000 --> 57:06.540
 on to everything else that's happening around you

57:06.540 --> 57:08.660
 and in your head, mainly, right?

57:08.660 --> 57:10.400
 Distractions about things you should be doing,

57:10.400 --> 57:12.280
 could be doing, or might be doing

57:12.280 --> 57:14.160
 and focus on what you need to do.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.660
 And then that's required for triggering

57:16.660 --> 57:18.820
 the acetylcholine neuromodulator

57:20.160 --> 57:21.760
 that will then allow you to highlight

57:21.760 --> 57:24.840
 the particular synapses that will then later change in sleep.

57:24.840 --> 57:27.840
 So no nootropic allows you to bypass the need

57:27.840 --> 57:29.840
 for sleep and deep rest.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.280
 That's important to understand.

57:31.280 --> 57:36.200
 So I daydream about a day

57:36.200 --> 57:41.160
 when people will be able to access compounds

57:41.160 --> 57:43.760
 that are safe, that will allow them to learn better,

57:43.760 --> 57:47.240
 meaning to access information, focus better,

57:47.240 --> 57:50.360
 as well as to sleep better and activate the plasticity

57:50.360 --> 57:51.920
 from the learning bout.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.240
 Right now, most nootropics tend to bundle

57:54.240 --> 57:55.400
 a bunch of things together.

57:55.400 --> 57:59.560
 Most of them include some form of stimulant, caffeine.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.420
 Episode two, I tell you more,

58:01.420 --> 58:02.600
 probably than you ever wanted to know

58:02.600 --> 58:04.560
 about caffeine adenosine and how that works.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.520
 So refer there for how caffeine works.

58:07.600 --> 58:10.760
 But stimulants will allow you to increase focus

58:10.760 --> 58:12.520
 up to a particular point.

58:12.520 --> 58:15.320
 If you have too little alertness in your system,

58:15.320 --> 58:16.640
 you can't focus too much.

58:16.640 --> 58:19.400
 However, you start to cliff and focus drifts, okay?

58:19.400 --> 58:23.100
 So you can't just ingest more stimulant to be more focused.

58:23.100 --> 58:24.520
 It doesn't work that way.

58:24.520 --> 58:28.000
 Most nootropics also include things that increase

58:28.000 --> 58:30.400
 or are designed to increase acetylcholine,

58:30.400 --> 58:34.060
 things like alpha-GPC and other things of that sort.

58:34.060 --> 58:35.820
 And indeed, there's some evidence

58:35.820 --> 58:37.240
 that they can increase acetylcholine.

58:37.240 --> 58:40.120
 I refer you again to examine.com, the website,

58:40.120 --> 58:43.320
 to evaluate any supplements or compounds for their safety

58:43.320 --> 58:45.320
 and their effects in humans and animals.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.920
 Free website, as well as with links to studies.

58:49.920 --> 58:51.720
 So we need the focus component.

58:51.720 --> 58:52.960
 We need the alertness component.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.800
 The alertness component comes from epinephrine,

58:54.800 --> 58:57.240
 traditionally from caffeine stimulation.

58:57.240 --> 59:00.100
 The acetylcholine stimulation traditionally comes

59:00.100 --> 59:03.800
 from choline donors or alpha-GPC, things of that sort.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.000
 And then you would want to have some sort of off switch

59:07.000 --> 59:09.880
 because anything that's going to really stimulate

59:09.880 --> 59:12.360
 your alertness that then provides a crash,

59:12.360 --> 59:14.880
 that crash is not a crash into the deep kind

59:14.880 --> 59:18.520
 of restful slumber that you would want for learning.

59:18.520 --> 59:20.520
 It's a crash into the kind of,

59:22.640 --> 59:26.840
 let's just call it lopsided sleep, meaning it's deep sleep,

59:26.840 --> 59:29.320
 but it lacks certain spindles and other elements

59:29.320 --> 59:31.180
 of the physiology, sleep spindles,

59:31.180 --> 59:33.700
 that really engage the learning process

59:33.700 --> 59:35.880
 and the reconfiguration of synapses.

59:35.880 --> 59:40.880
 So right now, my stance on nootropics is that maybe,

59:40.920 --> 59:45.600
 maybe for occasional use, provided it's safe for you,

59:45.600 --> 59:48.480
 I'm not recommending it, but in general,

59:48.480 --> 59:51.560
 it tends to use more of a shotgun approach

59:51.560 --> 59:54.000
 than is probably going to be useful

59:54.000 --> 59:56.900
 for learning and memory in the long run.

59:56.900 --> 59:59.620
 A lot of people ask about modafinil or armodafinil,

59:59.620 --> 1:00:01.540
 which was designed for treatment of narcolepsy.

1:00:01.540 --> 1:00:03.440
 So right there, it tells you it's a stimulant.

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.560
 And yes, there is evidence

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:05.860
 it will improve learning and memory.

1:00:05.860 --> 1:00:07.340
 Modafinil is very expensive.

1:00:07.340 --> 1:00:08.840
 Last time I checked, armodafinil,

1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:12.880
 I think is the recent released generic version of this

1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:14.920
 that's far less expensive.

1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:17.040
 Most of these things look a lot like amphetamine

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:21.380
 and many of them have the potential for addiction

1:00:21.380 --> 1:00:25.200
 or can be habit forming, but more importantly,

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:28.160
 a lot of those things also can create metabolic effects

1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:30.480
 by disruption to insulin receptors and so forth.

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.920
 So you want to approach those

1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:34.700
 with a strong sense of caution.

1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:38.240
 Now, there are the milder things that act as nootropics.

1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:40.420
 I mentioned some of them like alpha-GPC.

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:42.760
 Some people like ginkgo.

1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:45.720
 Ginkgo gives me vicious headaches, so I don't take it.

1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:47.680
 So, you know, people really differ.

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:52.080
 Last podcast, I recommended magnesium threonate

1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:53.960
 if you were exploring supplements.

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:55.600
 I'm not recommending anything directly.

1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:57.580
 I'm just saying if you're exploring supplements,

1:00:57.580 --> 1:01:01.000
 magnesium threonate seems among the magnesiums

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:05.200
 to be one of the more bioavailable and useful for sleep.

1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:07.500
 I recommend it actually to a good friend of mine.

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:09.600
 It gave him, at very low dose,

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:11.320
 he had stomach issues with it.

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:12.820
 He just had to simply stop taking it.

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:14.220
 So there's variability there.

1:01:14.220 --> 1:01:16.360
 You just, it gave him some stomach cramping

1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:17.800
 and just didn't feel good on it.

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:19.540
 Stopped it, he felt better.

1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:22.580
 Other people take magnesium threonate and feel great.

1:01:22.580 --> 1:01:25.000
 I was asked, do magnesium need to be taken

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.200
 with or without food, daytime or before sleep?

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:29.080
 If you're going to go that route,

1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:31.340
 it should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep

1:01:31.340 --> 1:01:33.040
 because it's designed to make you sleepy.

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:36.420
 And I'm not aware that it has to be taken with food,

1:01:36.420 --> 1:01:38.480
 but again, all of this has to be run by your doctor

1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:41.320
 and this is your healthcare to govern.

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:44.800
 Not, these are not strict recommendations, so look into it.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:47.640
 But magnesium threonate,

1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:48.880
 most people have recommended it

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:52.160
 to have benefit from it tremendously.

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:55.240
 Some people can't tolerate it, so you have to find out.

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:57.280
 There were a number of questions about other supplements

1:01:57.280 --> 1:01:59.660
 designed to access deep sleep

1:01:59.660 --> 1:02:01.800
 in part to access neuroplasticity,

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.440
 but now I'm just sort of transitioning

1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:06.200
 from neuroplasticity to these compounds

1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:07.120
 that can regulate sleep.

1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:09.240
 One of them that I discussed at the end of the last podcast,

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:10.200
 I got a lot of questions about,

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:14.000
 is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.760
 Apigenin, if you look in the literature,

1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:19.260
 the way it works is it increases some of the enzymes

1:02:19.260 --> 1:02:21.100
 associated with GABA metabolism.

1:02:21.100 --> 1:02:24.640
 It actually, GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.280
 It's the neurotransmitter that is increased

1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:30.960
 after a couple drinks containing alcohol

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:32.700
 and that shut down the forebrain.

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:37.500
 Apigenin is a derivative of the chamomile.

1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:39.600
 I think the proper pronunciation of this

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:41.640
 is matricaria chamomila,

1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:42.880
 although I always feel like I should be using

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.080
 a Spanish accent whenever I say something like that.

1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:49.320
 Other related things that impact the GABA system

1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:51.880
 and increase GABA are things like passion flower,

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:55.040
 which is passiflora incurata.

1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:57.280
 I don't know why the Italian, is that Italian?

1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:00.120
 Anyway, my Italian colleagues, please forgive me.

1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:02.500
 I have some very close Italian friends

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:03.820
 and colleagues in Genoa.

1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:06.600
 I butchered the Italian, sorry.

1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:10.320
 In any event, apigenin and passion flower

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:14.400
 found in a lot of supplements

1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:16.560
 designed to increase sleepiness and sleep

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.800
 and they work presumably because they increase GABA.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:21.060
 Actually, they work on chloride channels

1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:22.360
 rather than give you a whole lecture

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:24.800
 on membrane biophysics and neurons.

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.200
 I'll just say that when neurons are really active,

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:31.740
 it's because sodium ions, salt, rushes into the cells

1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:33.680
 and causes them to fire electrically.

1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:36.680
 The cells tend to become less active as more chloride,

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:38.860
 which is a negatively charged ion.

1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:41.240
 This is probably taking some of you back

1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:44.840
 to either the wonderful times or traumas

1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:46.280
 of high school physics.

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:48.040
 The chloride is negatively charged

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:51.360
 so it tends to make cells less electrically positive

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:53.080
 because it carries a negative charge

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:55.480
 and hyperpolarizes the neuron.

1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.600
 So apigenin works through these,

1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:59.960
 increasing the activity of these chloride channels.

1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:02.120
 Passion flower works by increasing the activity

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:04.500
 of these chloride channels and GABA transmission.

1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:07.340
 It tends to increase this inhibitory neurotransmitter

1:04:07.340 --> 1:04:09.480
 that shuts off our thinking,

1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:11.720
 our analysis of duration, path, and outcome.

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:14.240
 So if you're going to explore these things,

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.360
 I suggest you at least know how they work.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:19.280
 You at least go to examine.com

1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:21.360
 that you talk to your doctor about them.

1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:23.740
 Some people asked about serotonin

1:04:23.740 --> 1:04:26.840
 for getting to sleep and staying asleep.

1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:29.560
 Now I understand the rationale here.

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:30.960
 Just like I understand the rationale

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:33.680
 of taking something like mucuna purines or L-DOPA

1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:34.880
 to increase dopamine.

1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:36.760
 But sometimes what works on paper

1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:38.920
 doesn't really work in the real world.

1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:41.100
 I personally have tried taking a supplement

1:04:41.100 --> 1:04:42.880
 which was L-Tryptophan,

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:46.440
 which is the precursor to serotonin or 5-HTP,

1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:48.040
 which is designed to increase,

1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:49.600
 it is serotonin basically.

1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:52.360
 You're just one biochemical step away

1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:55.080
 from taking actual serotonin.

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:56.180
 And I'll be honest,

1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:58.960
 the sleep that I had with increased serotonin

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.740
 by way of tryptophan or 5-HTP was dreadful.

1:05:01.740 --> 1:05:03.620
 I fell asleep almost immediately.

1:05:03.620 --> 1:05:04.600
 You say, well, that's great.

1:05:04.600 --> 1:05:06.220
 And 90 minutes later I woke up

1:05:06.220 --> 1:05:08.440
 and I couldn't sleep almost for 48 hours.

1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:09.260
 Now that was me.

1:05:09.260 --> 1:05:11.160
 I have a pretty sensitive system to certain things

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:12.200
 and not to other things.

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:13.480
 Some people love these things.

1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:16.760
 So you really have to be thoughtful and explore them

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:20.160
 with that kind of awareness of being thoughtful

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:22.040
 and realizing that what works for you

1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:23.080
 might not work for everybody

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:25.760
 and what works for everybody might not work for you.

1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:27.040
 Okay, I'd like to continue

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.640
 by talking about the role of temperature

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:34.640
 in sleep, accessing sleep, staying asleep and wakefulness.

1:05:36.060 --> 1:05:38.320
 But first I want to tell a joke

1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:40.360
 because I think this joke really captures

1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:42.600
 some of the critical things to understand

1:05:42.600 --> 1:05:46.160
 about any self experimentation that you might do.

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:48.240
 So this is a story that was told to me

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:49.200
 by a colleague of mine

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:52.220
 who's now a professor of Caltech, not to be named.

1:05:53.580 --> 1:05:57.080
 So there's a scientist and they're in their lab

1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:59.040
 and they're trying to understand

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.080
 how the nervous system works.

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:03.840
 So they go over to a tank and they pick up a frog

1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:08.160
 and they take the frog and they put it down on the table

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:11.440
 and they clap and the frog jumps.

1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:16.320
 So they think for a while, they pick up the frog, okay.

1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:18.160
 They go over to the cabinet

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:22.520
 and they take out a little bit of a paralytic drug

1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:26.240
 and they inject it locally into the back leg,

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:30.880
 set it down and clap and the frog jumps,

1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:33.360
 but it kind of like jumps to the side a little bit.

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:35.440
 They pick it up,

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:38.520
 they inject the paralytic into the other back leg.

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:40.200
 They clap again.

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:42.960
 The frog jumps, but it really doesn't jump well that time,

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:45.320
 it kind of drags itself forward.

1:06:45.320 --> 1:06:47.100
 So they pick it up and they inject the paralytic

1:06:47.100 --> 1:06:49.320
 into the remaining two legs.

1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:54.320
 They set it down and they clap and the frog doesn't jump.

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:58.720
 They go, oh my goodness, the legs are used for hearing.

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:02.280
 Now they publish the paper.

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:05.520
 Paper comes out in a great journal, news releases.

1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:06.520
 It's a really big deal.

1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:08.440
 Their career takes off.

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:12.240
 20 years later, a really smart graduate student comes along

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:15.360
 and says, yeah, but that's loss of function.

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:17.380
 Doesn't really show gain of function.

1:07:17.380 --> 1:07:18.840
 So let's take a closer look.

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:22.800
 So they repeat the first experiment and it checks out.

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.400
 Everything happens the same way,

1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:29.580
 but then they take the frog and they inject a drug

1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:34.160
 into all four legs that turns off the paralytic, right?

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:35.560
 It's an antagonist.

1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:40.240
 They set the frog down, they clap and the frog jumps.

1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:42.180
 They go, oh my goodness, it's true.

1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:45.180
 The legs really are for hearing.

1:07:45.180 --> 1:07:47.800
 Now, first of all, I want to make the point

1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:50.280
 that this is not to illustrate

1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:52.080
 that science is not a good practice.

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:52.900
 It is.

1:07:52.900 --> 1:07:54.480
 We need to do loss of function

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:56.720
 and gain in function experiments,

1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:59.360
 but just to show that correlation and causation

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:00.220
 is complicated.

1:08:00.220 --> 1:08:02.440
 You need to do a variety of control experiments

1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:04.800
 and you really need to figure out what works for you.

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:07.640
 And so while science can provide answers

1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:10.200
 about what works under very controlled conditions,

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:14.100
 it doesn't and can never address all the situations

1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:16.480
 in which a given compound, a given practice

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:17.800
 will or won't work.

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.360
 And it's not just individual variability,

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.120
 it's that there are a number of different factors.

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:23.960
 You of course know that light can activate

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:25.120
 and shift your circadian rhythm,

1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:27.240
 but so can exercise, so can food.

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:28.940
 The last point I want to make is an important one,

1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:33.940
 which is that no frogs were hurt in the telling of this joke.

1:08:33.980 --> 1:08:35.640
 Okay, so let's continue.

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:37.380
 I want to talk about temperature.

1:08:37.380 --> 1:08:39.140
 Temperature is super interesting

1:08:39.140 --> 1:08:41.520
 as it relates to circadian rhythms

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.260
 and wakefulness and sleep.

1:08:44.660 --> 1:08:46.580
 First, let's take a look at what's happening

1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:51.580
 to our body temperature across each 24 hour cycle.

1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:54.780
 In general, our temperature tends to be lowest

1:08:54.780 --> 1:08:59.640
 right around 4 a.m. and starts creeping up around 6 a.m.,

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:04.640
 8 a.m., and peaks sometime between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.280
 Now that varies from person to person,

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:10.000
 but in general, if we were to continuously monitor

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.160
 or occasionally monitor temperature,

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:12.920
 that's what we would see.

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:14.960
 Now what's interesting is that even in the absence

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:19.560
 of any light cues or meal cues, we would have a shift.

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:22.080
 We would have an oscillation or a rhythm in our temperature

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.440
 that would go from high to low.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.680
 This is why the idea that we're all 96.8

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.600
 and that's our correct temperature, forget that.

1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:30.500
 That is no longer true.

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.560
 It never was true.

1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:34.240
 It depends on what time of day you measure temperature.

1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:37.320
 However, there is a range which is within normal range.

1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:38.940
 I think most of us associate fever

1:09:38.940 --> 1:09:41.480
 with somewhere around 100, 101, 103.

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.860
 That's concerning.

1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:43.960
 And we will be very concerned

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:46.600
 if temperature dropped too low as well.

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.140
 The way that the temperature rhythm that's endogenous,

1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:52.720
 that's within us and rhythmic no matter what,

1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:57.080
 the way it gets anchored to the pattern I described before

1:09:57.080 --> 1:09:59.480
 of being lowest at 4 a.m. and increasing again

1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:03.600
 around through the day until about 4 to 6 p.m.

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.600
 is by way of entrainment or matching to some external cue,

1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:13.320
 which is almost always going to be light, but also exercise.

1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:17.120
 Now you may have experienced this temperature rhythm

1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:20.800
 and how quickly it can become unentrained

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:23.520
 or it can fall out of entrainment.

1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:25.900
 Here's an experiment I wouldn't want you to do

1:10:25.900 --> 1:10:28.120
 but you've probably experienced this before

1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:31.420
 where you wake up, it's sunny outside

1:10:31.420 --> 1:10:33.760
 and maybe you have some email or some things to take care of

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:35.400
 or maybe you didn't sleep that well the night before

1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.680
 and so you stay indoors.

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:39.340
 You don't change anything about your breakfast.

1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:42.640
 You don't change anything about your within home temperature

1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:43.920
 or anything like that.

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:45.880
 And somewhere right around 10 or 11 o'clock

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:48.880
 you start feeling kind of chilled, like you're cold.

1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:51.600
 Well, what happened was the oscillators,

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.400
 the clocks in your various tissues

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:56.100
 that are governed by temperature and circadian rhythm

1:10:56.100 --> 1:10:58.680
 are starting to split away

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:00.880
 from your central clock mechanisms.

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:02.300
 So it's actually important

1:11:02.300 --> 1:11:04.760
 that your temperature match day length.

1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:06.840
 Now there's another way in which temperature matches

1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:08.440
 or daytime, excuse me.

1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:09.840
 There's also an important way

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:11.520
 in which temperature matches day length.

1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:15.560
 In general, as days get longer, it tends to be hotter out.

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:18.320
 Not always, but in general, that's the way it is.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:21.740
 And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside.

1:11:21.740 --> 1:11:25.440
 So temperature and day length are also linked.

1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:26.820
 Metabolically they're linked,

1:11:26.820 --> 1:11:29.760
 biologically they're linked, excuse me,

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.320
 and atmospherically they're linked

1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:32.660
 for the reasons that we talked about before

1:11:32.660 --> 1:11:34.960
 about duration of day length

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:37.440
 and other climate features and so forth.

1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.480
 So one of the most powerful things

1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:41.760
 about setting your circadian rhythm properly

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:44.200
 is that your temperature will start to fall

1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:45.400
 into a regular rhythm.

1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:48.420
 And that temperature has a very strong effect

1:11:48.420 --> 1:11:50.440
 on things like metabolism

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:53.120
 and when you will feel most willing

1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:55.440
 and interested in exercising.

1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:58.160
 Typically the willingness to exercise and engage

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:00.240
 in any kind of activity, mental or physical,

1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:03.600
 is going to be when that rise in temperature is steepest,

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:05.240
 when the slope of that line is greatest.

1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:07.040
 That's why 30 minutes after waking

1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:08.280
 is one of those key windows,

1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:10.040
 as well as three hours after waking.

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:12.340
 And then when temperature actually peaks,

1:12:12.340 --> 1:12:17.340
 which is generally, generally about 11 hours after waking.

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:20.580
 So this is why we say that temperature

1:12:20.580 --> 1:12:22.400
 and circadian rhythm are linked,

1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:25.320
 but they're actually even more linked than that.

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:27.880
 We've talked before about how light enters the eye,

1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:30.120
 triggers activation of these melanopsin cells,

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:31.400
 which then triggers activation

1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:32.920
 of the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:34.660
 the master circadian clock.

1:12:34.660 --> 1:12:36.620
 And then I always say the master circadian clock

1:12:36.620 --> 1:12:38.860
 informs all the cells and tissues of your body

1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:41.760
 and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.

1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:44.080
 But what I've never answered

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:46.640
 was how it actually puts them into that rhythm.

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:48.360
 And it does it two ways.

1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.160
 One is it secretes a peptide.

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:51.480
 A peptide is just a little protein

1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:53.400
 that floats through the bloodstream

1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:54.920
 and signals to the cells, okay,

1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:56.760
 we're tuning your clock kind of like a little,

1:12:56.760 --> 1:12:57.760
 you know, in a watch store,

1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:00.300
 the watch store owner would tune the clocks.

1:13:00.300 --> 1:13:03.680
 But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:05.820
 under which those cells exist.

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:08.720
 So temperature is actually the effector

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.660
 of the circadian rhythm.

1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:12.200
 Now, this is really important

1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:15.620
 because changes in temperature by way of exercise,

1:13:15.620 --> 1:13:18.760
 by way of eating, but especially by way of exercise

1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:22.200
 can start to shift our circadian rhythm pretty dramatically.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.920
 But let's even go to a more extreme example.

1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.160
 Nowadays, there's some interest in cold showers

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:29.240
 and ice baths.

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.880
 Not everybody is doing this, I realize.

1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:33.200
 People seem to either love this or hate this.

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:35.480
 I don't mind the cold dunk thing.

1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:38.280
 I get regular about this from time to time and I'll do it.

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:39.880
 I haven't been doing it recently.

1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:41.760
 It's always painful to do the first couple of times

1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:43.280
 and then you get kind of used to it.

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:45.960
 However, I've taken people to a cold dunk or an ice bath.

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:47.080
 I have a family member

1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.880
 who wouldn't get in literally past her toes.

1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:51.960
 She was like, this is just too aversive for me.

1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:55.520
 Some people really like the cold, people very tremendously.

1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:57.840
 Getting into an ice bath is very interesting

1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:01.520
 because you have a rebound increase in thermogenesis.

1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:03.720
 Now, you should know from the previous episode

1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:06.040
 that as that temperature increases,

1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:07.980
 it will shift your circadian rhythm

1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.160
 and which direction it shifts your circadian rhythm

1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:11.360
 will depend on whether or not you're doing it

1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:12.780
 during the daytime or late in the day.

1:14:12.780 --> 1:14:14.920
 If you do it after 8 p.m.,

1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:17.720
 it's going to make your day longer, right?

1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:21.320
 Because your body and your central clocks

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:24.640
 are used to temperature going up early in the day

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:26.800
 and throughout the day and peaking in the afternoon.

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:29.120
 If you then increase that further

1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:32.080
 or you simply increase it over its baseline at 8 p.m.

1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:34.240
 after temperature was already falling,

1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:36.560
 even if it's just by a half a degree or a couple of degrees

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.280
 or you do that with exercise, doesn't have to be

1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:40.600
 with the ice bath, you are extending,

1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:41.800
 you are shifting forward,

1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:44.280
 you're phase delaying your clock,

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:45.920
 you're convincing your clock

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:47.320
 and therefore the rest of your body

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:49.520
 that the day is still going, right?

1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:50.960
 You're giving it the perception,

1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:53.840
 the cellular and physiological perception

1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:54.960
 that the day is getting longer

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:57.560
 and you will want to naturally stay up later

1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:59.220
 and wake up later.

1:14:59.220 --> 1:15:01.680
 Now, you might say, wait, I do an ice bath late at night

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:04.320
 and I feel great and I fall deeply asleep.

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:07.640
 Well, cold can trigger the release of melatonin.

1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:09.480
 There's a rebound increase in melatonin.

1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:11.760
 So that could be the cause of that effect.

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:13.320
 You have to see what works for you.

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:16.240
 But if you do the ice bath early in the day

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:20.040
 and then get out, you will experience a more rapid rise

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.200
 or cold shower early in the day,

1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:25.120
 a more rapid rise in your body temperature

1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:27.140
 that will phase advance your clock

1:15:27.140 --> 1:15:30.300
 and make it easier to get up early the following day.

1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:33.060
 So for those of you that are having trouble getting up

1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:34.600
 and this is going to almost sound laughable,

1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:36.420
 but a cold shower first thing in the morning

1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:37.680
 will wake you up.

1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:40.280
 But that's waking you up in the short term

1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:41.600
 because of a different mechanism

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:42.960
 which I'll talk about in a moment.

1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:44.640
 But it also is shifting your clock.

1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:47.200
 It's phase advancing your clock

1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:50.480
 in a way that makes you more likely to get up earlier

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:52.400
 the next day, okay?

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:54.640
 So in other words, increasing your temperature

1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:59.040
 by getting in an ice bath or cold shower or exercising

1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:03.000
 which causes a compensatory increase in body temperature.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.200
 Think about the normal pattern of body temperature,

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:08.960
 low around 4.35 AM, starts to peak right around waking,

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:11.600
 start, excuse me, starts to increase right around waking,

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.960
 then steep slope, steep slope to a peak around 4 to 6 PM

1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:16.320
 and then drops off.

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.440
 If you introduce an increase in body temperature

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:20.960
 by way of cold exposure early in the day,

1:16:21.820 --> 1:16:25.960
 let's say 6 AM or 5 AM if you're masochistic enough

1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:28.720
 to get into a cold shower at that time, more power to you,

1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:31.740
 it's going to make you want to wake up about half hour

1:16:31.740 --> 1:16:34.160
 to an hour earlier the next day than you normally would.

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:37.020
 Whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling,

1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:39.400
 it will tend to delay and make your body perceive

1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:41.280
 as if the day is getting longer.

1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:43.480
 These are phase advances and phase delays.

1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:45.560
 We're going to get into this in far more detail

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:48.720
 when we talk about jet lag and shift work in episode four

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:50.260
 as well as other things.

1:16:50.260 --> 1:16:54.240
 But temperature is, again, it's not just one tool

1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:57.560
 to manipulate wake up time and circadian rhythm

1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:00.120
 and metabolism, it is the effector.

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:02.240
 It is the way that the central circadian clock

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:04.400
 impacts all the cells and tissues of your body.

1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:06.080
 If you want to read further about this

1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:08.120
 and you're really curious about the role of temperature,

1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:09.740
 work by Joe Takahashi,

1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:12.480
 who used to be at Northwestern University

1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:15.680
 and is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:19.180
 incredible scientist and has really worked out

1:17:19.180 --> 1:17:20.720
 a lot of the mechanisms around temperature

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.640
 and circadian rhythms.

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:23.920
 You can just Google his name

1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:26.380
 and you'll see a whole bunch of studies there.

1:17:26.380 --> 1:17:30.140
 I want to talk about cold and cold exposure

1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:32.820
 because there's a great misconception about this

1:17:32.820 --> 1:17:35.780
 that actually you can leverage once you understand

1:17:35.780 --> 1:17:39.860
 how to use cold to either increase thermogenesis

1:17:39.860 --> 1:17:42.040
 and fat loss, metabolism,

1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:45.060
 or you can use it for stress mitigation and mood.

1:17:45.060 --> 1:17:47.380
 And it really depends on one simple feature

1:17:47.380 --> 1:17:49.780
 of how you approach the ice bath or cold shower.

1:17:51.180 --> 1:17:54.000
 If you get into an ice bath or cold shower

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.060
 and you are calming yourself,

1:17:56.060 --> 1:17:58.440
 you're actively calming the autonomic nervous system,

1:17:58.440 --> 1:17:59.940
 maybe through some deep breathing,

1:17:59.940 --> 1:18:02.700
 maybe through visualization, maybe you sing a song.

1:18:02.700 --> 1:18:04.180
 People do this stuff.

1:18:04.180 --> 1:18:05.340
 They use various tools.

1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:08.160
 Some people find paying attention to an external stimulus

1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:09.820
 is more helpful.

1:18:09.820 --> 1:18:12.380
 Thinking about something, not the experience of the cold.

1:18:12.380 --> 1:18:14.780
 Other people find that directly experiencing the cold

1:18:14.780 --> 1:18:17.140
 in its most intense form and kind of going into the cold,

1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:19.860
 quote unquote, is the best way to approach it.

1:18:19.860 --> 1:18:21.740
 It really varies for people.

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:24.180
 There's no right or wrong way to go about this.

1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:28.100
 But the goal of using cold exposure for stress inoculation

1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:30.780
 and to raise your stress threshold,

1:18:30.780 --> 1:18:32.860
 to be able to tolerate heightened levels

1:18:32.860 --> 1:18:35.640
 of real life stress, not the ice bath,

1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:37.400
 but real life stress like work stress

1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:39.160
 and relational stress, et cetera,

1:18:40.580 --> 1:18:43.860
 is by suppressing the activation

1:18:43.860 --> 1:18:46.380
 of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,

1:18:46.380 --> 1:18:48.340
 meaning the alertness or stress system.

1:18:49.780 --> 1:18:51.660
 That involves buffering

1:18:51.660 --> 1:18:53.720
 or trying to resist the shiver response.

1:18:53.720 --> 1:18:55.980
 The shiver response is an autonomic response

1:18:55.980 --> 1:18:59.080
 designed to generate heat, presumably,

1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:00.980
 and actually that is what it does,

1:19:00.980 --> 1:19:03.120
 in order to counter the cold.

1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:05.740
 So when you use cold exposure

1:19:05.740 --> 1:19:07.340
 and you're kind of muscling through it

1:19:07.340 --> 1:19:09.100
 or you're learning to relax within it

1:19:09.100 --> 1:19:11.420
 as a form of stress inoculation,

1:19:11.420 --> 1:19:14.560
 that's great and works quite well for that purpose.

1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:16.900
 And there's a reason why cold exposure is used

1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:20.580
 in a variety of forms of military stress inoculation,

1:19:20.580 --> 1:19:25.580
 most famous of which of course is the Navy Seal Buds Test,

1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:27.780
 really, which is screening procedure for becoming a seal,

1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:29.820
 involves a lot of exposure to cold water.

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:35.300
 However, if you're interested in using cold exposure

1:19:35.300 --> 1:19:37.700
 for fat loss and thermogenesis,

1:19:37.700 --> 1:19:40.580
 you want to do the exact opposite thing.

1:19:40.580 --> 1:19:43.900
 There was a paper published in Nature two years ago,

1:19:43.900 --> 1:19:47.380
 which showed that cold-induced shiver,

1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:49.360
 the actual physical shiver,

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:53.660
 activates the release of a chemical in the body

1:19:53.660 --> 1:19:58.660
 from muscle called succinate, S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E.

1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:02.200
 Succinate travels in the bloodstream

1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:05.880
 and then goes and activates a particular category of fat,

1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:08.020
 not the typical kind of pink or white fat

1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:09.960
 that we think of as like blubber in humans,

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.700
 the stuff that people seem to generally want less of,

1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:15.640
 except for those genetic freaks

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:16.740
 that seem to have none of it,

1:20:16.740 --> 1:20:18.080
 depending on what they consume.

1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:19.180
 Congratulations.

1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:23.160
 Brown fat is called brown fat

1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:26.160
 because it's actually dark under the microscope.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:28.080
 It's rich with mitochondria,

1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:30.000
 and it exists mostly between the scapulae

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:31.080
 and in the upper neck,

1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:35.800
 and it generates thermogenesis and heat in the body.

1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:39.980
 It's rich with a certain category of adrenergic receptor.

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:44.840
 Incidentally, epinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors.

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:49.840
 These brown fat cells increase metabolism.

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:52.820
 It's called brown fat thermogenesis

1:20:52.820 --> 1:20:54.620
 and cause fat burning,

1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:57.860
 burning of other kinds of fat, the pink and white fat.

1:20:57.860 --> 1:20:58.780
 So what does this all mean?

1:20:58.780 --> 1:21:01.340
 This means if you want to use the ice bath

1:21:01.340 --> 1:21:04.580
 in order to increase metabolism, shiver away.

1:21:04.580 --> 1:21:06.620
 If you want to use the ice bath or cold shower

1:21:06.620 --> 1:21:10.380
 in order to stress inoculate, resist the shiver

1:21:10.380 --> 1:21:14.320
 and learn to stay calm or quote unquote muscle through it.

1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:15.160
 Now, I don't know

1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:17.940
 that anyone's ever really talked about this publicly

1:21:17.940 --> 1:21:19.740
 because I think the data are so new,

1:21:19.740 --> 1:21:21.500
 and I think that people assume

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.180
 that the ice bath or cold exposure is just one thing.

1:21:24.180 --> 1:21:26.180
 Here, I've talked about it three ways

1:21:26.180 --> 1:21:27.580
 to shift your circadian rhythm

1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:29.980
 depending on whether or not you're doing it early in the day

1:21:29.980 --> 1:21:33.520
 while your temperature is still rising or at its peak

1:21:34.460 --> 1:21:38.800
 or after that peak in order to extend the perception

1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:40.660
 of your day as continuing

1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:45.120
 and make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later.

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:47.140
 Now, and then the third way of course

1:21:47.140 --> 1:21:49.860
 is to either activate brown fat thermogenesis

1:21:49.860 --> 1:21:51.060
 and increase metabolism.

1:21:51.060 --> 1:21:52.460
 I suppose the fourth way would be

1:21:52.460 --> 1:21:57.460
 to increase stress tolerance or stress threshold, okay?

1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:01.100
 But remember temperature is the effector

1:22:01.100 --> 1:22:02.480
 of circadian rhythms.

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:03.880
 Light is the trigger.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.980
 The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock

1:22:07.980 --> 1:22:10.300
 that mediates all these changes.

1:22:10.300 --> 1:22:12.220
 Also influenced by non-photic influence

1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:15.620
 like exercise and feeding and things of that sort,

1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:17.280
 but temperature is the effector.

1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:21.700
 Now, you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating.

1:22:21.700 --> 1:22:24.740
 When you travel and you land in a new location

1:22:24.740 --> 1:22:27.700
 and your schedule is inverted 12 hours,

1:22:27.700 --> 1:22:30.580
 one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly

1:22:30.580 --> 1:22:32.860
 is to get onto the local meal schedule.

1:22:32.860 --> 1:22:34.400
 Now, that probably has to do with two effects.

1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:36.140
 One are changes in temperature,

1:22:36.140 --> 1:22:39.580
 eating-induced increases in body temperature.

1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:41.460
 Now you should understand why that would work.

1:22:41.460 --> 1:22:45.260
 As well as eating has this anticipatory secretion

1:22:45.260 --> 1:22:47.820
 of beta of hypercretinorexin

1:22:47.820 --> 1:22:49.500
 that I talked about it earlier.

1:22:49.500 --> 1:22:51.780
 So if this is getting a little too down in the weeds,

1:22:51.780 --> 1:22:53.400
 don't worry about it.

1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:55.520
 I will get more into this in episode four

1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:56.780
 of how to shift one's rhythm,

1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.580
 but I would love for people to understand

1:22:58.580 --> 1:23:02.380
 that light and temperature are the real heavy duty levers

1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:04.140
 when it comes to moving your circadian rhythm

1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:06.300
 and sleep times and activity schedules.

1:23:06.300 --> 1:23:08.660
 And exercise and feeding can help,

1:23:08.660 --> 1:23:10.420
 but really temperature and light

1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:13.500
 with light being the primary one are the most important

1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:16.400
 when it comes to sleep and wakefulness.

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:20.540
 Many people asked questions about food and neurotransmitters

1:23:20.540 --> 1:23:23.660
 and how those relate to sleep, wakefulness, and mood,

1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:28.660
 which is essentially 25 hours of content for me to cover,

1:23:28.700 --> 1:23:30.060
 but I'm going to try and distill out

1:23:30.060 --> 1:23:31.420
 the most common questions.

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:34.100
 We've talked a lot about neuromodulators

1:23:34.100 --> 1:23:37.060
 like dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.

1:23:37.060 --> 1:23:39.480
 You may notice in those discussions

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:43.220
 that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan.

1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:44.900
 Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.

1:23:44.900 --> 1:23:46.700
 It comes from the foods that we eat.

1:23:47.620 --> 1:23:51.020
 Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.

1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:53.180
 It comes from the foods that we eat.

1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:55.500
 And then once we ingest them,

1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:59.100
 those compounds circulate to a variety

1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:01.040
 of different cells and tissues,

1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:03.620
 but it is true that our food

1:24:03.620 --> 1:24:04.620
 and the particular foods we eat

1:24:04.620 --> 1:24:08.100
 can influence things like neuromodulator levels

1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:09.420
 to some extent.

1:24:09.420 --> 1:24:10.860
 It's not the only way

1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:13.560
 because there are also enzymes and biochemical pathways

1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:14.460
 that are going to regulate

1:24:14.460 --> 1:24:17.300
 how much tyrosine gets converted into dopamine.

1:24:17.300 --> 1:24:19.940
 And there are elements of the dopaminergic neurons,

1:24:19.940 --> 1:24:22.120
 the dopamine neurons themselves that are electrical

1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:24.060
 that have influence on this as well.

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:28.480
 But there are a couple fair assumptions that we can make.

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:32.920
 First of all, nuts and meats, in particular red meats,

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:36.620
 tend to be rich in things like tyrosine, right?

1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:37.900
 That tells you right there

1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:40.260
 that because tyrosine is the precursor of dopamine

1:24:40.260 --> 1:24:42.840
 and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine

1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:44.240
 and epinephrine,

1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:47.620
 that those foods tend to lend themselves

1:24:47.620 --> 1:24:51.820
 toward the production of dopamine and epinephrine

1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:53.060
 and the sorts of things

1:24:53.060 --> 1:24:55.700
 that are associated with wakefulness.

1:24:55.700 --> 1:24:58.220
 Now, of course, the volume of food that we eat

1:24:58.220 --> 1:24:59.580
 also impacts our wakefulness.

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.420
 If we eat a lot of anything,

1:25:01.420 --> 1:25:05.500
 whether or not it's ribeye, steaks, rice, or cardboard,

1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:06.780
 please don't eat cardboard,

1:25:06.780 --> 1:25:08.900
 your stomach, if it's very distended,

1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:11.180
 will draw a lot of blood into your gut

1:25:11.180 --> 1:25:13.660
 and you will divert blood from other tissues

1:25:13.660 --> 1:25:14.740
 and you'll become sleepy.

1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:16.280
 So it's not just about food content,

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:18.660
 it's also about food volume, all right?

1:25:18.660 --> 1:25:21.780
 Fasting states generally are associated

1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:24.740
 with more alertness, epinephrine, and so forth.

1:25:24.740 --> 1:25:28.260
 And fed states are generally associated

1:25:28.260 --> 1:25:30.460
 with more quiescence and relaxation,

1:25:30.460 --> 1:25:33.000
 serotonin, and the kind of things

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.300
 that lend themselves more towards sleep

1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:37.180
 and less toward alertness.

1:25:37.180 --> 1:25:39.160
 Foods that are rich in tryptophan

1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:40.780
 tend to be things like white meat turkey,

1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:43.060
 also complex carbohydrates.

1:25:43.060 --> 1:25:46.720
 So if you like, you can start experimenting,

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:48.620
 depending on what foods you eat,

1:25:48.620 --> 1:25:53.060
 you can start experimenting with carbohydrate-rich meals

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:57.900
 for accessing sleep and more depth of sleep.

1:25:57.900 --> 1:25:59.660
 This is actually something that I personally do.

1:25:59.660 --> 1:26:01.960
 I tend to eat pretty low carb-ish during the day.

1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:03.920
 I actually fast until about noon,

1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:05.520
 not because I have to work to do that,

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:07.180
 but because I'd rather just drink caffeine

1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:08.820
 and water during that time.

1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:10.260
 And then sometime around noon,

1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:12.340
 I can't take it anymore and I'm hungry.

1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:14.700
 And I eat and I try and eat low carb-ish

1:26:14.700 --> 1:26:16.500
 unless I've worked out extremely hard

1:26:16.500 --> 1:26:19.680
 in the previous two hours, which I rarely do,

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:21.460
 although I do sometimes.

1:26:21.460 --> 1:26:25.020
 And that meal is then designed to prolong

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:27.100
 my period of wakefulness into the late afternoon.

1:26:27.100 --> 1:26:29.160
 And then sometime around dinnertime,

1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:31.820
 which for me is around 6.30, 7 p.m, 8 p.m,

1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:33.300
 sometimes as late as 9 p.m,

1:26:33.300 --> 1:26:37.300
 I tend to eat things like white meat, fish, pastas, rice,

1:26:37.300 --> 1:26:38.500
 and that kind of thing.

1:26:39.620 --> 1:26:42.200
 My favorite food of all for accessing tryptophan

1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:43.300
 is actually a starch.

1:26:43.300 --> 1:26:45.940
 It's actually a vegetable and it's the croissant,

1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:47.660
 which is my favorite vegetable.

1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:50.440
 I don't eat those all the time, but I love them.

1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:53.140
 And they seem to increase dopamine as well.

1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:55.940
 Never actually done the mass spectrometry on a croissant,

1:26:55.940 --> 1:26:58.220
 but they definitely increase tryptophan

1:26:58.220 --> 1:26:59.680
 and relaxation for me.

1:27:00.540 --> 1:27:03.620
 In all seriousness, low carbohydrate

1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:05.820
 slash fasted slash ketogenic diets

1:27:05.820 --> 1:27:07.520
 tend to lend themselves toward wakefulness

1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:11.380
 by way of increasing epinephrine, norepinephrine,

1:27:11.380 --> 1:27:13.680
 adrenaline, dopamine, and things of that sort.

1:27:14.580 --> 1:27:16.580
 Carbohydrate-rich meals,

1:27:16.580 --> 1:27:19.020
 and I suppose we should talk about meals as opposed to diet,

1:27:19.020 --> 1:27:23.260
 tend to lend themselves more toward tryptophan, serotonin,

1:27:23.260 --> 1:27:25.260
 and more lethargic states.

1:27:25.260 --> 1:27:29.660
 There is very limited evidence that I am aware of

1:27:29.660 --> 1:27:32.340
 that carbohydrates should be eaten at one time a day

1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:35.860
 as it relates to metabolism, et cetera.

1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:39.140
 I'm sure that will open up a certain amount of debate.

1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:41.420
 If you work out very hard and you deplete glycogen,

1:27:41.420 --> 1:27:42.960
 then this all changes.

1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.300
 So some people are working out very hard

1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:46.700
 in depleting glycogen, other people are not.

1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:48.820
 That gets way outside the context

1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:50.460
 of this particular podcast.

1:27:50.460 --> 1:27:52.940
 But yes, indeed, different foods can bias

1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:54.020
 different neuromodulators

1:27:54.020 --> 1:27:57.100
 and thereby can modulate our waking

1:27:57.100 --> 1:27:59.760
 or our feelings of lethargy and sleepiness.

1:28:02.100 --> 1:28:06.200
 There are a couple of effects of food that are independent,

1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:07.820
 or I should say a couple of effects of eating

1:28:07.820 --> 1:28:08.760
 because the food won't do it

1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:09.900
 when it's sitting across the table,

1:28:09.900 --> 1:28:13.540
 but of eating that are powerful

1:28:13.540 --> 1:28:16.700
 for modulating circadian rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.

1:28:16.700 --> 1:28:18.020
 And that's because every time we eat,

1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:20.580
 we get eating-induced thermogenesis

1:28:20.580 --> 1:28:21.940
 regardless of what we eat.

1:28:21.940 --> 1:28:24.220
 Now, the eating-induced thermogenesis

1:28:24.220 --> 1:28:25.540
 and increase in metabolism,

1:28:25.540 --> 1:28:28.380
 which is an increase in temperature really,

1:28:28.380 --> 1:28:33.380
 is probably greatest for amino acid-rich foods like meats,

1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:37.240
 but also other types of foods.

1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:39.540
 It's a minimal increase in body temperature

1:28:39.540 --> 1:28:42.780
 compared to say cold exposure or exercise.

1:28:42.780 --> 1:28:44.940
 Now, whether or not it's a quarter of a degree

1:28:44.940 --> 1:28:46.060
 or half a degree or a degree,

1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:47.980
 it really depends on the individual.

1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:50.360
 And of course there are blood sugar effects.

1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:54.420
 There are things like whether or not you are type one

1:28:54.420 --> 1:28:55.460
 or type two diabetic,

1:28:55.460 --> 1:28:56.940
 whether or not you're insulin resistant,

1:28:56.940 --> 1:28:59.020
 whether or not like there's a kid

1:28:59.020 --> 1:29:03.140
 who interns on the podcast here who's 17 years old

1:29:03.140 --> 1:29:05.740
 and I'm convinced that he can eat anything

1:29:05.740 --> 1:29:09.020
 and he just seems to like burn it up and he's growing.

1:29:09.020 --> 1:29:10.420
 Every time, actually the other day,

1:29:10.420 --> 1:29:12.660
 he walked into the other room and two days later,

1:29:12.660 --> 1:29:14.100
 he walked out of the same room.

1:29:14.100 --> 1:29:15.320
 He came out in between, of course.

1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:17.940
 But, and I was like, he grew.

1:29:17.940 --> 1:29:19.480
 He was like, you know, but he's at that stage

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:21.860
 where he's just growing.

1:29:21.860 --> 1:29:23.700
 Food is going to affect a teenager very differently

1:29:23.700 --> 1:29:26.020
 than it's going to affect a full grown person.

1:29:26.020 --> 1:29:31.020
 So in general, starchy carbohydrates, white meats,

1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:33.900
 such as turkey, some fish, increased tryptophan,

1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:37.420
 therefore serotonin, therefore more lethargic states,

1:29:37.420 --> 1:29:38.340
 more calm.

1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:42.640
 Meat, nuts, and there are probably some plant-based foods

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:44.580
 that I'm not aware of and I apologize,

1:29:44.580 --> 1:29:45.980
 I should read up on this,

1:29:45.980 --> 1:29:48.060
 that also are high in tyrosine

1:29:48.060 --> 1:29:51.480
 that can increase things like dopamine, norepinephrine,

1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.820
 epinephrine, alertness.

1:29:53.820 --> 1:29:56.420
 So you can vary these however you like.

1:29:56.420 --> 1:29:58.900
 Most people I think are eating a variety of these things

1:29:58.900 --> 1:30:00.300
 in given meals.

1:30:00.300 --> 1:30:02.580
 And there are other parameters of nutrition

1:30:02.580 --> 1:30:03.780
 that are important too.

1:30:03.780 --> 1:30:05.940
 Volume of food for the reasons I mentioned before,

1:30:05.940 --> 1:30:08.020
 the volume of food in the gut,

1:30:08.020 --> 1:30:09.980
 less food in the gut, whether or not it's empty

1:30:09.980 --> 1:30:12.020
 or a small amount of food will tend to correlate

1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:12.940
 with wakefulness.

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:16.820
 Large volumes of food of any kind

1:30:16.820 --> 1:30:21.020
 will tend to correlate and drive the calming response

1:30:21.020 --> 1:30:23.100
 and that's by way of this nerve pathway called the vagus.

1:30:23.100 --> 1:30:25.100
 We actually have sensory fibers in the gut

1:30:25.100 --> 1:30:27.780
 that communicate to a little protrusion of neurons

1:30:27.780 --> 1:30:28.820
 that sit right next to the juggler

1:30:28.820 --> 1:30:32.460
 called the nodose ganglia, N-O-D-O-S-E.

1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:37.020
 Unlike Costello, it's nodose, right now he's all those.

1:30:37.020 --> 1:30:39.840
 Nodose actually means having many protrusions

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:42.380
 and it's like kind of a lumpy collection of neurons,

1:30:42.380 --> 1:30:43.700
 a ganglia is just a collection of neurons

1:30:43.700 --> 1:30:46.260
 and then it goes into the brain stem

1:30:46.260 --> 1:30:48.400
 and then forward in the brain to the areas of the brain

1:30:48.400 --> 1:30:52.780
 that are involved in production of various neuromodulators.

1:30:53.900 --> 1:30:57.180
 So what we eat and the volume of food

1:30:57.180 --> 1:30:59.220
 are both signaling to the brain,

1:30:59.220 --> 1:31:01.180
 it's not just one or the other.

1:31:01.180 --> 1:31:04.220
 And then there's also this eating induced thermogenesis

1:31:04.220 --> 1:31:06.160
 and now you know from the discussion about temperature

1:31:06.160 --> 1:31:08.020
 that if you're eating early in the day,

1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:10.040
 you're tending to shift your rhythm earlier

1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:13.420
 so that you'll want to wake up earlier the next day

1:31:13.420 --> 1:31:15.300
 if you're eating very late in the day,

1:31:15.300 --> 1:31:17.580
 even if you can fall asleep after that,

1:31:17.580 --> 1:31:19.180
 there's a tendency for you to want to sleep

1:31:19.180 --> 1:31:20.700
 later the next day.

1:31:20.700 --> 1:31:23.260
 Now, this of course is all going to be constrained

1:31:23.260 --> 1:31:24.700
 by when your kids need to eat

1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:25.820
 and when your spouse needs to eat

1:31:25.820 --> 1:31:26.740
 and when your friends need to eat

1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:28.860
 or if you live alone or what other things you're doing.

1:31:28.860 --> 1:31:31.340
 If you're like me and you kind of don't eat until noon

1:31:31.340 --> 1:31:32.600
 then eat sometime around noon

1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:33.900
 and then I'm terrible about meals,

1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:35.200
 I just start eating the ingredients

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:36.180
 while I'm supposed to be cooking

1:31:36.180 --> 1:31:37.580
 and then eventually they're all gone

1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:41.380
 and I guess that's a meal, it varies.

1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:43.220
 Some people are neurotically attached

1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:46.020
 to a particular meal schedule, some people are not.

1:31:46.020 --> 1:31:49.220
 I take my light exposure schedule far more seriously

1:31:49.220 --> 1:31:50.860
 than I take my meal schedule,

1:31:50.860 --> 1:31:53.100
 although in general, I try and eat healthy foods

1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:55.100
 for the most part, croissants included.

1:31:56.300 --> 1:31:57.540
 I was asked several times

1:31:57.540 --> 1:32:00.700
 whether or not men and women or males and females

1:32:00.700 --> 1:32:03.100
 differ in terms of these neurotransmitter phenotypes

1:32:03.100 --> 1:32:05.840
 and the rhythms of sleep and temperature.

1:32:08.100 --> 1:32:09.340
 We could probably devote a whole month

1:32:09.340 --> 1:32:11.060
 and we probably will devote an entire month

1:32:11.060 --> 1:32:13.140
 to what are called sex differences

1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:14.960
 because those tend to be related to things

1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:18.020
 we absolutely know like XX or XY chromosomes

1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:20.380
 or XYY in some cases or double X chromosomes

1:32:21.340 --> 1:32:24.940
 as opposed to gender, sex and karyotype as we call it,

1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:27.040
 genetic makeup is crystal clear.

1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:32.060
 There are things that correlate with one or the other

1:32:32.060 --> 1:32:34.380
 but it's complicated and it's not something

1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:38.180
 that's been explored in what I think is enough detail.

1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:42.200
 Actually recently, I guess it was about five years ago,

1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:45.220
 the National Institutes of Health made it a mandate

1:32:45.220 --> 1:32:48.780
 that all studies use sex as a biological variable

1:32:48.780 --> 1:32:51.380
 and actually explore both sexes of mice,

1:32:51.380 --> 1:32:53.500
 both sexes of humans when doing any kind of study

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:56.340
 because there was a bias towards only using male animals

1:32:56.340 --> 1:32:58.700
 or male subjects prior to that time.

1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:00.220
 So a lot of data are now coming out

1:33:00.220 --> 1:33:02.620
 revealing important sex differences

1:33:02.620 --> 1:33:05.180
 that I think are going to have powerful impact

1:33:05.180 --> 1:33:07.700
 on health practices, et cetera, response to drugs,

1:33:07.700 --> 1:33:10.740
 response to different sleep schedules, et cetera.

1:33:10.740 --> 1:33:13.220
 Perhaps the most salient and obvious one

1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:14.580
 is that during pregnancy,

1:33:16.220 --> 1:33:18.420
 females experience a whole range

1:33:18.420 --> 1:33:21.020
 of endocrine and neural effects

1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:23.020
 and we definitely will devote a month

1:33:23.020 --> 1:33:25.620
 to pregnancy and childbirth and child rearing.

1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:29.060
 And for that, I'd really like to bring in some experts.

1:33:29.060 --> 1:33:31.060
 I've got terrific colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere

1:33:31.060 --> 1:33:32.100
 that work on these things

1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:33.560
 so that we can go into those in more depth.

1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:35.660
 So I'm not blowing off those questions,

1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:38.220
 I'm just kind of pushing them down the road a little bit

1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:42.340
 where I can give you a more thorough answer.

1:33:42.340 --> 1:33:43.780
 So as we finish up,

1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:46.140
 I just want to offer you the opportunity

1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:48.040
 to do an experiment.

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:49.780
 We've talked about a lot of variables

1:33:49.780 --> 1:33:51.940
 that can impact sleep and wakefulness

1:33:51.940 --> 1:33:53.780
 and in keeping with the theme of the podcast,

1:33:53.780 --> 1:33:55.260
 we are going to continue

1:33:55.260 --> 1:33:58.340
 to talk about sleep and wakefulness and tools for those

1:33:58.340 --> 1:34:01.580
 and the science behind those tools as we go forward.

1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:05.140
 But there are really just four simple parameters

1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:07.460
 that you have control over

1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:12.460
 that you can immediately start to record and take note of,

1:34:12.860 --> 1:34:15.300
 just to see how you're doing with these things.

1:34:15.300 --> 1:34:18.540
 With no judgment or perhaps no change

1:34:18.540 --> 1:34:20.100
 to what you're actually doing.

1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:22.820
 It might be interesting, just a suggestion,

1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:26.260
 to write down for each day

1:34:26.260 --> 1:34:28.980
 when you went outside to get sunlight

1:34:28.980 --> 1:34:30.980
 and when you did that relative to waking.

1:34:30.980 --> 1:34:31.940
 So you would write down,

1:34:31.940 --> 1:34:34.300
 like the way I do this in my calendar is I'll write down

1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:36.140
 that I don't get exact about it.

1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:39.380
 I might say I woke up at 6.15

1:34:39.380 --> 1:34:41.860
 and then I guess I'll put a W 6.15

1:34:41.860 --> 1:34:44.860
 and then SL for sunlight.

1:34:44.860 --> 1:34:46.740
 Now you sometimes get outside right away,

1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:48.100
 other times I'm less good at that

1:34:48.100 --> 1:34:51.020
 and I'll go out around, I don't know, let's say seven

1:34:51.020 --> 1:34:54.980
 and for how long, maybe like 10, 15 minutes or so.

1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:58.040
 And then I'll put a little check at roughly the times

1:34:58.040 --> 1:34:59.860
 that I eat my so-called meals,

1:34:59.860 --> 1:35:00.680
 although as I mentioned,

1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:02.640
 sometimes my meals are a bunch of small checks

1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:05.200
 that just kind of extend through the late hours of the day.

1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:09.820
 Yours might be more confined to certain times.

1:35:09.820 --> 1:35:14.140
 And then you might just take note of when you exercised,

1:35:14.140 --> 1:35:16.300
 just put down an E for when you exercise,

1:35:16.300 --> 1:35:19.380
 weight training or aerobic exercise.

1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:23.060
 And you might note when you might've felt chilled or cold

1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:25.780
 if you do, or you might've felt particularly hot

1:35:25.780 --> 1:35:26.940
 or if you woke up in the middle of the night

1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:27.940
 when you felt particularly hot.

1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:29.680
 And then the last thing you might want to do

1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:31.980
 is just write down if and when you did

1:35:31.980 --> 1:35:34.620
 a non-sleep deep rest protocol, NSDR protocol,

1:35:34.620 --> 1:35:37.040
 that could be meditation, that could be yoga nidra,

1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:38.520
 that could be hypnosis,

1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:43.160
 anything that you're using to deliberately

1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:45.940
 teach your nervous system how to go from more alertness

1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:48.020
 to more calmness in the waking state,

1:35:48.020 --> 1:35:49.380
 even if it's waking up in the middle of the night

1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:52.100
 and doing an NSDR protocol or in the afternoon

1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:54.620
 or first thing in the morning to recover some sleep

1:35:54.620 --> 1:35:57.420
 and ability to perform DPOs that you might've lost

1:35:57.420 --> 1:35:59.500
 from a minimal or poor night's sleep.

1:35:59.500 --> 1:36:01.620
 So you're going to write down when you woke up,

1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:03.340
 when you viewed sunlight,

1:36:03.340 --> 1:36:04.720
 that might be in the morning and the evening

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:05.780
 or just the morning,

1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:07.480
 hopefully it's the morning and the evening,

1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:10.460
 when you exercised, when you ate your meals

1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:12.620
 and using a simple record keeping scheme

1:36:12.620 --> 1:36:16.260
 like W for waking, SL for sunlight,

1:36:16.260 --> 1:36:18.100
 maybe you come up with a system where it's a check

1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:20.260
 or an X or something for exercise,

1:36:20.260 --> 1:36:22.900
 this is not designed to make you neurotically attached

1:36:22.900 --> 1:36:27.900
 to tracking all your behaviors and everything you do.

1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:30.680
 I, for instance, don't track what I eat in particular,

1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:32.420
 I kind of know what works for me

1:36:32.420 --> 1:36:35.640
 and I just try and stay within that range.

1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:38.100
 But by doing this, you can start to reveal

1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:39.820
 some really interesting patterns,

1:36:39.820 --> 1:36:42.900
 patterns that no answer that I could provide you

1:36:42.900 --> 1:36:46.700
 about any existing tool or protocol could counter.

1:36:48.140 --> 1:36:51.480
 It's really about taking the patterns of behaviors

1:36:51.480 --> 1:36:54.840
 of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise

1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:58.800
 and superimposing that on what you're learning

1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:01.020
 in this podcast and elsewhere, of course,

1:37:01.020 --> 1:37:03.080
 and what you already know, and trying to see

1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:07.020
 where certain problems or pain points might be arising.

1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:08.740
 Maybe you're eating really late in the day

1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:10.520
 and you're waking up in the middle of the night really warm,

1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:12.680
 well, now you would say, well, that could be due

1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:14.840
 to kind of an increase in temperature

1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:17.400
 that is extending my day.

1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:21.220
 Or maybe you start to find that using cold exposure

1:37:21.220 --> 1:37:24.080
 early in the day is great for you, but using it late,

1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:25.940
 if it's too late in the day, that's not great.

1:37:25.940 --> 1:37:30.180
 Or if you're into the sauna or it's even like some people,

1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:31.900
 including myself, if I take a hot shower

1:37:31.900 --> 1:37:34.420
 or sit in a hot tub or a sauna late at night,

1:37:34.420 --> 1:37:37.020
 well, then I get a compensatory decrease

1:37:37.020 --> 1:37:38.700
 in body temperature and I sleep great,

1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:40.280
 provided I hydrate well enough,

1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:42.000
 because that can be kind of a dehydrating thing

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.300
 to sit in hot conditions.

1:37:44.300 --> 1:37:46.660
 But if I do the sauna early in the day,

1:37:46.660 --> 1:37:49.740
 unless I exercise immediately afterward,

1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:51.620
 then I tend to get the temperature drop,

1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:53.460
 which makes sense because when you get in the sauna,

1:37:53.460 --> 1:37:56.420
 you get vasodilatation, you throw off a lot of heat,

1:37:56.420 --> 1:37:58.140
 and then you generally get a compensatory drop

1:37:58.140 --> 1:37:59.700
 in temperature, if you do that early in the day,

1:37:59.700 --> 1:38:02.300
 that's right about the time that that temperature

1:38:02.300 --> 1:38:04.960
 is trying to entrain the circadian clocks of your body.

1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:06.340
 That's what happens to me.

1:38:06.340 --> 1:38:08.060
 Other people, it might be slightly different.

1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:12.420
 And some people have more resilient systems than others.

1:38:12.420 --> 1:38:15.780
 So I just encourage you to start becoming scientists

1:38:15.780 --> 1:38:19.320
 of your own physiology, of your own brain and body,

1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:20.660
 and seeing how the various tools

1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:22.620
 that you may or may not be using

1:38:22.620 --> 1:38:25.380
 are affecting your patterns of sleep,

1:38:25.380 --> 1:38:27.720
 your patterns of attention and wakefulness.

1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:30.380
 It's vitally important that if you do this,

1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:32.840
 that you know that it's not about trying to get

1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:35.780
 onto an extremely rigid schedule.

1:38:35.780 --> 1:38:38.320
 It's really about trying to identify variables

1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:41.160
 that are most powerful for you and that push you

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:42.580
 in the direction that you want to go

1:38:42.580 --> 1:38:45.700
 and changing the variables that are pushing your body

1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:47.900
 and your mind in the directions that you don't want to go.

1:38:47.900 --> 1:38:49.660
 Self-experimentation is something

1:38:49.660 --> 1:38:52.220
 that should be done slowly, carefully.

1:38:52.220 --> 1:38:54.020
 You don't want to be reckless about this.

1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:57.620
 And this is where I would say manipulating one

1:38:57.620 --> 1:38:59.860
 or two variables at a time is really going to be best

1:38:59.860 --> 1:39:02.620
 as opposed to changing a dozen things all at once

1:39:02.620 --> 1:39:05.760
 to really identify what it is that's most powerful for you.

1:39:06.980 --> 1:39:09.840
 As always, thank you so much for your questions.

1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:11.980
 We are going to continue to answer questions.

1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:13.220
 I certainly didn't get to all of them,

1:39:13.220 --> 1:39:15.440
 but we tried to get to most all of the ones

1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:17.700
 that were frequently asked.

1:39:17.700 --> 1:39:19.420
 Episode four of the podcast,

1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:22.420
 I'm going to get into shift work, jet lag,

1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:27.160
 and age dependent changes in sleeping and wakefulness

1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:28.420
 and cognition.

1:39:28.420 --> 1:39:30.500
 So for those of you with kids,

1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:32.060
 for those of you that are kids,

1:39:32.060 --> 1:39:35.000
 for those of you with older relatives

1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.420
 or who might be older,

1:39:36.420 --> 1:39:40.500
 meaning probably when you start to get into late 60s, 70s,

1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:43.200
 and 80s is when there's some marked biological shifts

1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:46.100
 in temperature regulation and things that relate to sleep.

1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:49.240
 And for those of you that travel,

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:50.720
 we're going to talk about jet lag.

1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:53.360
 The shift work discussion might seem only relevant

1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:56.480
 to those that work nights, but actually that's not the case.

1:39:56.480 --> 1:39:58.600
 Most people, because of the way they're interacting

1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:03.060
 with devices, are actually in a form of shift work now,

1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:05.600
 where the days are certainly not nine to five,

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:07.000
 so-called banker's hours,

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:08.700
 and then the lights are out at nine

1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:10.560
 and they're asleep until 5 a.m.

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:12.820
 Some people have that schedule, most people do not.

1:40:12.820 --> 1:40:16.640
 So episode four, we will go deeply into shift work,

1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:19.580
 jet lag, age dependent changes in sleep alertness

1:40:19.580 --> 1:40:21.720
 and cognition, and I will touch back

1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:22.840
 on a few of your questions,

1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:24.720
 but don't think that if your question wasn't answered

1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:26.880
 during these office hours that we won't get to it.

1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:28.840
 I absolutely will at some point.

1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:33.760
 In addition to that, several of you have graciously asked

1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:35.520
 how you can help support the podcast,

1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:37.600
 and we very much appreciate that.

1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:41.840
 You can support the podcast by liking it on YouTube,

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:43.780
 by subscribing on YouTube,

1:40:43.780 --> 1:40:46.480
 by recommending the YouTube videos to others,

1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.100
 as well as subscribing and downloading the podcast on Apple,

1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:53.560
 where you can also leave a review, and on Spotify,

1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:55.800
 or all three, if you like.

1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:58.040
 You can also help us by supporting our sponsors,

1:40:58.040 --> 1:40:59.500
 so check out some of the sponsor links

1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:02.080
 that were described at the beginning of the episode.

1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:04.360
 And in general, recommending the podcast

1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.080
 to people that you know and that you think would benefit

1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:08.280
 from the information would be terrific.

1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:12.000
 As always, I will be continuing to post on Instagram.

1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.320
 You can expect another podcast episode out next Monday

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:17.920
 about the topics that we've been discussing this month.

1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:20.720
 And above all, thank you for your interest in science.

1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:25.720
 We'll see you next time.
