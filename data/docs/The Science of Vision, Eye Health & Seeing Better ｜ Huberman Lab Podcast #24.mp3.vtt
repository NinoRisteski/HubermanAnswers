00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.460
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.460 --> 00:13.340
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.340 --> 00:15.220
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.940
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:16.940 --> 00:18.660
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.880
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:20.880 --> 00:23.160
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.160 --> 00:25.240
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.240 --> 00:26.940
 to the general public.

00:26.940 --> 00:28.340
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.340 --> 00:31.360
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.220
 Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:33.220 --> 00:36.260
 Founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,

00:36.260 --> 00:39.380
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses have really been designed

00:39.380 --> 00:41.580
 with the utmost care and the utmost attention

00:41.580 --> 00:44.660
 to the science of optics and the visual system.

00:44.660 --> 00:46.300
 So one of the things I like so much

00:46.300 --> 00:48.420
 about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:48.420 --> 00:50.620
 is that they're extremely lightweight.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.260
 If you get sweaty, so for instance,

00:52.260 --> 00:54.420
 if you wear them while running or walking or hiking,

00:54.420 --> 00:56.020
 they don't slip off.

00:56.020 --> 00:58.480
 And with the sunglasses, when you're outdoors,

00:58.480 --> 01:00.980
 if there's cloud cover or if there's shadows

01:00.980 --> 01:02.660
 or if the day gets brighter or dimmer,

01:02.660 --> 01:05.220
 you can still see your surroundings perfectly well.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.980
 And that's because the designers at Roka

01:06.980 --> 01:09.580
 really understand the way the visual system works,

01:09.580 --> 01:11.740
 how it habituates, how it adapts.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.540
 You don't need to understand the science behind all that,

01:13.540 --> 01:15.380
 but they do, and as a consequence,

01:15.380 --> 01:18.480
 the eyeglasses perform extremely well under all conditions,

01:18.480 --> 01:21.460
 whether or not that's indoors or outdoors.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.880
 So they put a ton of science and purpose into the design.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.360
 They also happen to look really good.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.020
 They have a really nice aesthetic.

01:27.020 --> 01:30.740
 A lot of, as you know, performance active wear eyeglasses

01:30.740 --> 01:33.340
 look rather ridiculous, but the Roka glasses,

01:33.340 --> 01:35.700
 I think have a very nice aesthetic to them

01:35.700 --> 01:37.000
 that you could wear anywhere.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.620
 If you'd like to check out Roka glasses,

01:38.620 --> 01:41.700
 you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com

01:41.700 --> 01:43.860
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout,

01:43.860 --> 01:46.100
 and you'll get 20% off your first order.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.060
 That's Roka, R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman

01:50.060 --> 01:52.320
 at checkout for 20% off your order.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.620
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.060
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

01:58.060 --> 02:00.780
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

02:00.780 --> 02:02.300
 to help you better understand your body

02:02.300 --> 02:04.180
 and reach your health goals.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.860
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done

02:06.860 --> 02:09.580
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

02:09.580 --> 02:12.620
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

02:12.620 --> 02:15.260
 can only be analyzed from a blood test.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.660
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

02:17.660 --> 02:20.940
 we can also get insight into our specific DNA makeup

02:20.940 --> 02:24.680
 and how that influences our lifestyle choices

02:24.680 --> 02:26.940
 and our health status.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.700
 The problem with a lot of blood tests

02:28.700 --> 02:30.600
 is that you get a lot of information back,

02:30.600 --> 02:33.520
 but you don't always know what to do with that information.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.840
 With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy to use,

02:35.840 --> 02:38.220
 personalized dashboard platform

02:38.220 --> 02:41.820
 that informs you what sorts of lifestyle, nutrition,

02:41.820 --> 02:44.880
 exercise changes you might want to make

02:44.880 --> 02:47.600
 according to the levels of particular metabolic factors,

02:47.600 --> 02:51.540
 hormone factors, et cetera, in your blood and DNA.

02:51.540 --> 02:53.100
 So it makes everything very simple,

02:53.100 --> 02:55.580
 both in terms of where you're at health-wise

02:55.580 --> 02:57.980
 and what you should or could do

02:57.980 --> 02:59.300
 in order to improve your health,

02:59.300 --> 03:02.540
 something I do believe most everybody would like to do.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.700
 With Inside Tracker, it makes all that very easy.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.940
 They also have something called the Inner Age Test.

03:06.940 --> 03:10.060
 This is a test that shows you what your biological age

03:10.060 --> 03:12.680
 and compares that, of course, to your chronological age.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.100
 And of course, your biological age

03:14.100 --> 03:15.260
 is really what you want to know

03:15.260 --> 03:17.220
 because it's a predictor of how long

03:17.220 --> 03:19.700
 you're going to live and the quality of your life.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.220
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

03:21.220 --> 03:24.400
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.240
 And if you do that,

03:25.240 --> 03:28.360
 you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.760
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.980
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.100
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

03:36.100 --> 03:39.040
 that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.000
 Everybody needs something different

03:41.000 --> 03:42.380
 in terms of what to sleep on.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.940
 Some people like a hard mattress,

03:43.940 --> 03:45.180
 some people like a soft mattress,

03:45.180 --> 03:46.540
 some people tend to run warm,

03:46.540 --> 03:48.420
 some people tend to run cold.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.460
 With Helix Sleep, you go to their website,

03:50.460 --> 03:52.860
 you take a very brief two-minute quiz,

03:52.860 --> 03:54.500
 and you answer some questions such as,

03:54.500 --> 03:55.800
 do you tend to sleep on your stomach

03:55.800 --> 03:56.720
 or your side or your back?

03:56.720 --> 03:57.560
 Maybe you don't know,

03:57.560 --> 03:59.740
 do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.540
 At the end of that quiz, you match to a specific mattress.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.180
 I took that quiz about six months ago

04:04.180 --> 04:06.420
 and I matched to the dusk mattress.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.100
 And I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress

04:08.100 --> 04:09.660
 from Helix for the last six months.

04:09.660 --> 04:13.220
 And I've been sleeping better than I ever have before.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.220
 Basically, everyone's unique and Helix understands that.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.460
 And that's built into the design of their mattresses

04:18.460 --> 04:21.420
 and this two-minute quiz that you take to match you to one.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.500
 If you'd like to try a Helix Sleep mattress,

04:23.500 --> 04:26.680
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

04:26.680 --> 04:28.220
 take their two-minute quiz,

04:28.220 --> 04:30.500
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.420
 You'll also get up to $200 off any mattress order

04:33.420 --> 04:34.360
 and two free pillows.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.300
 They make terrific pillows.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.700
 You'll get a 10-year warranty on that mattress

04:38.700 --> 04:40.860
 and you get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.

04:40.860 --> 04:41.780
 If you don't like it,

04:41.780 --> 04:43.140
 they'll come pick it up and take it away.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.740
 You won't get charged, you'll get your money back, et cetera.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.500
 So that's helixsleep.com slash Huberman

04:48.500 --> 04:51.280
 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.220
 We are now beginning a new topic

04:53.220 --> 04:55.380
 for the next four to five episodes

04:55.380 --> 04:57.580
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.080
 Before we move into that,

04:59.080 --> 05:01.340
 I want to just briefly touch on a couple of questions

05:01.340 --> 05:03.260
 that I got from the last episode,

05:03.260 --> 05:06.380
 which was related to the science of endurance training.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.540
 I described the four kinds of endurance training.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.620
 We posted protocols of the specific four kinds

05:11.620 --> 05:14.320
 of endurance training at HubermanLab.com.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.400
 Just go to that episode.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.380
 You can see the download.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.240
 It's a zero-cost PDF.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.900
 I got a lot of questions

05:19.900 --> 05:22.020
 about what's called concurrent training,

05:22.020 --> 05:24.840
 which is how to program endurance training

05:24.840 --> 05:26.540
 if you are also interested

05:26.540 --> 05:28.580
 in strength and hypertrophy training,

05:28.580 --> 05:31.260
 or how to incorporate strength and hypertrophy training,

05:31.260 --> 05:35.780
 which was in the previous episode, with endurance training.

05:35.780 --> 05:38.180
 This can all be made very simple.

05:38.180 --> 05:40.380
 Ask yourself, what are you trying to emphasize?

05:40.380 --> 05:43.460
 And then emphasize that for a 10 to 12-week cycle.

05:43.460 --> 05:46.380
 So if you're mostly interested in endurance,

05:46.380 --> 05:48.920
 I would say use a three to two ratio.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.000
 Maybe get three endurance training workouts per week,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.440
 maybe four, and two strength and hypertrophy workouts.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.280
 If you're mainly focusing on strength and hypertrophy,

05:59.280 --> 06:02.220
 get three or four workouts for strength and hypertrophy,

06:02.220 --> 06:05.220
 and do two endurance workouts.

06:05.220 --> 06:08.340
 Start with the minimum number of sets that's required

06:08.340 --> 06:10.740
 to get the result that you want.

06:10.740 --> 06:13.140
 So if you're not accustomed to doing endurance work,

06:13.140 --> 06:14.620
 you would start with the minimum number

06:14.620 --> 06:16.180
 that's listed on that protocol.

06:16.180 --> 06:17.540
 So if it says three to five sets,

06:17.540 --> 06:20.100
 you would start with three, maybe even just two,

06:20.100 --> 06:24.020
 and then work your way up by adding sets each week.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.500
 I do suggest that people get

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
 at least one complete rest day per week,

06:27.500 --> 06:30.140
 although I know a lot of people don't like that.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.060
 I benefit from that.

06:31.060 --> 06:33.240
 I actually benefit from having two complete rest days

06:33.240 --> 06:34.080
 each week.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.460
 I just continue to make progress that way,

06:35.460 --> 06:37.460
 whether or not it's for strength and hypertrophy

06:37.460 --> 06:39.160
 or for endurance.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.820
 I am a big believer in rest days.

06:40.820 --> 06:41.740
 Other people are not.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.260
 And those could be active rest days, hiking,

06:43.260 --> 06:44.460
 relaxing, et cetera.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.960
 After a 10 to 12-week cycle,

06:47.960 --> 06:50.180
 then I also suggest taking anywhere

06:50.180 --> 06:52.520
 from five to seven days completely off.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.140
 You can still enjoy life and do things.

06:54.140 --> 06:56.540
 I know for you addicted exercisers

06:56.540 --> 06:58.020
 that you're going to loathe to do that,

06:58.020 --> 06:59.660
 but that's one way to stay injury-free,

06:59.660 --> 07:01.740
 keep your joints and tissues healthy over time,

07:01.740 --> 07:03.260
 and continue to make progress.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.260
 If you don't want to do that week off, don't do it.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.180
 None of this is holy.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.900
 None of it is a strict prescriptive.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.940
 Just ask yourself, what are you going to emphasize?

07:09.940 --> 07:12.020
 And emphasize that in terms of the total volume

07:12.020 --> 07:14.900
 of workouts that you do and work up incrementally

07:14.900 --> 07:17.320
 and then move into another cycle.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.600
 That's what I suggest.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.940
 So go to hebermanlab.com.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.740
 You can get the protocol there.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.940
 We are now going to move into a new topic

07:23.940 --> 07:25.780
 unrelated to physical performance,

07:25.780 --> 07:27.500
 starting with this episode.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.460
 And for the next four to five episodes,

07:30.460 --> 07:33.260
 we are going to talk all about the senses.

07:34.340 --> 07:39.340
 That's sight, eyesight, hearing, touch,

07:39.340 --> 07:41.900
 taste, smell.

07:41.900 --> 07:44.520
 And we are also going to talk about this critical sense

07:44.520 --> 07:46.140
 that we call interoception,

07:46.140 --> 07:49.000
 or our sense of our internal real estate.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.720
 Now, the reason that we are talking about the senses

07:51.720 --> 07:53.740
 is because if you understand

07:53.740 --> 07:56.680
 how the senses are perceived,

07:56.680 --> 07:57.540
 what they're about,

07:57.540 --> 08:00.940
 what the underlying cells and connections are about,

08:00.940 --> 08:02.940
 you will be in a terrific position

08:02.940 --> 08:06.180
 to understand the month's topic that follows,

08:06.180 --> 08:08.540
 which is all about mental health.

08:08.540 --> 08:11.780
 Now, I want to emphasize that if you're somebody

08:11.780 --> 08:13.700
 who doesn't have any trouble

08:13.700 --> 08:16.760
 seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling,

08:16.760 --> 08:19.220
 and has an excellent sense of interoception,

08:20.460 --> 08:21.860
 I do believe that these episodes

08:21.860 --> 08:23.960
 will still be very relevant to you

08:23.960 --> 08:25.300
 because they have everything to do

08:25.300 --> 08:27.440
 with how you move through the world,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.820
 how you make sense of information,

08:29.820 --> 08:33.340
 and how you organize your thoughts and your emotions.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.460
 I also want to emphasize

08:34.460 --> 08:37.020
 that we're going to cover a lot of practical tools.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.020
 So today's episode is going to be all about vision

08:40.020 --> 08:42.760
 and eyesight, a topic that's very near and dear to my heart

08:42.760 --> 08:44.980
 because it's the one that I've been focusing on

08:44.980 --> 08:48.020
 for well over 25 years of my career.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.740
 But we're not just going to get into the mechanistic details

08:50.740 --> 08:53.740
 about how light is converted into electrical potentials

08:53.740 --> 08:55.020
 and things like that.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.900
 We are going to talk about practical tools

08:57.900 --> 09:00.380
 that you can and should use

09:00.380 --> 09:03.620
 to help maintain the health of your visual system

09:03.620 --> 09:05.500
 and your eyesight.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.900
 Very often, young people will say, what should I do?

09:08.900 --> 09:11.580
 You're always talking about neuroplasticity

09:11.580 --> 09:13.320
 and how it tapers off over time,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.420
 but I'm a young person, what should I do?

09:16.520 --> 09:20.460
 You should absolutely train and support your eyesight.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.500
 In fact, if you're a young person and you see perfectly

09:23.500 --> 09:26.100
 or you feel as if you see the world perfectly,

09:26.100 --> 09:29.060
 you are in the best position to bolster,

09:29.060 --> 09:31.140
 to reinforce that visual system

09:31.140 --> 09:33.980
 so that you don't lose your vision as you age.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.160
 In addition, you can leverage your visual system

09:36.160 --> 09:38.060
 for better mental and physical performance,

09:38.060 --> 09:39.640
 and we're going to talk about that.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.820
 If you're somebody who suffers

09:40.820 --> 09:44.220
 from a clinical disorder of vision, you have trouble seeing,

09:44.220 --> 09:46.620
 or if you need corrective lenses in order to see,

09:46.620 --> 09:48.360
 this episode is definitely for you.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.060
 And while, of course, I can't make clinical diagnoses,

09:51.060 --> 09:53.120
 I can't have a one-to-one conversation

09:53.120 --> 09:56.300
 with any of you in this format, nor am I a clinician,

09:56.300 --> 09:59.220
 I'm a scientist, not a physician,

09:59.220 --> 10:02.740
 I did consult with our chair of ophthalmology,

10:02.740 --> 10:05.100
 Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg at Stanford University

10:05.100 --> 10:07.580
 School of Medicine, as well as several other people

10:07.580 --> 10:09.540
 to really vet the information and make sure

10:09.540 --> 10:11.220
 that the protocols that I'm describing

10:11.220 --> 10:13.560
 are consistent with the clinical literature.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.840
 If you have a severe eye problem,

10:14.840 --> 10:19.560
 you should be working with a really good ophthalmologist

10:19.560 --> 10:22.700
 and or optometrist, but certainly an ophthalmologist

10:22.700 --> 10:24.380
 who's a medical doctor.

10:24.380 --> 10:26.300
 But I do believe that the information

10:26.300 --> 10:27.600
 that we're going to discuss today

10:27.600 --> 10:29.260
 is going to be relevant to everybody,

10:29.260 --> 10:32.540
 and we'll set the stage for the month on mental health.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.460
 And mental performance.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.100
 So let's get started.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.740
 When we hear the word vision,

10:37.740 --> 10:41.160
 we most often think about eyesight or our ability

10:41.160 --> 10:45.000
 to perceive shapes and objects and faces and colors.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.100
 And indeed, vision involves eyesight,

10:48.100 --> 10:50.120
 our ability to see shapes and objects

10:50.120 --> 10:52.440
 and faces and colors and so forth.

10:52.440 --> 10:57.440
 However, our eyes are responsible for much more than that,

10:57.820 --> 11:01.280
 including our mood, our level of alertness,

11:01.280 --> 11:05.300
 and all of that is included in what we call vision.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.900
 So I just want to take about three, maybe four minutes

11:08.900 --> 11:11.380
 and talk about how the visual system works,

11:11.380 --> 11:14.560
 how it's built and how you are able

11:14.560 --> 11:17.540
 to so-called see things around you.

11:17.540 --> 11:21.220
 I also want to describe the ways in which your eyes

11:21.220 --> 11:24.120
 and your visual system impact your mood

11:24.120 --> 11:25.900
 and your level of alertness.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.740
 And then we are going to get right into some protocols,

11:28.740 --> 11:31.060
 some specific things that each and all of you

11:31.060 --> 11:35.620
 should do if you want to enhance your vision

11:35.620 --> 11:38.500
 and maintain your vision as you get older.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.360
 And again, if you're a 15-year-old or a 12-year-old,

11:42.360 --> 11:43.940
 this episode is especially for you

11:43.940 --> 11:46.340
 because your nervous system is far more plastic

11:46.340 --> 11:47.220
 than mine is.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.900
 It's much more amenable to change.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.660
 So you can really build a very strong visual system.

11:51.660 --> 11:55.140
 And in doing that, and if you adopt specific behaviors

11:55.140 --> 11:58.740
 at any age of light viewing at particular times

11:58.740 --> 12:02.420
 in particular ways, then you can build an emotional system

12:02.420 --> 12:04.900
 that's also reinforced by your visual system.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.980
 So let's talk about vision.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.820
 What is vision?

12:07.820 --> 12:10.180
 Well, vision starts with the eyes.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.380
 We have no what's called extra ocular light perception.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.880
 While it feels good to have light on our skin,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.440
 while it feels good to be outside in the sunlight

12:20.440 --> 12:23.700
 for most people, the only way that light information

12:23.700 --> 12:25.820
 can get to the cells of your body

12:25.820 --> 12:27.380
 is through these two little goodies

12:27.380 --> 12:28.220
 on the front of your face.

12:28.220 --> 12:31.280
 And for those of you listening, I'm just pointing to my eyes

12:31.280 --> 12:33.380
 as many of you have heard me say before

12:33.380 --> 12:35.980
 on this and other podcasts, your eyes in particular,

12:35.980 --> 12:38.940
 your neural retinas are part of your central nervous system.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.260
 They are part of your brain.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.520
 They're the only part of your brain

12:42.520 --> 12:44.940
 that sits outside the cranial vault.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.220
 In other words, you have two pieces of your brain

12:47.220 --> 12:49.760
 that deliberately got squeezed out of the skull

12:49.760 --> 12:51.640
 during development and placed in these things

12:51.640 --> 12:53.000
 we call eye sockets.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.260
 There's a genetic program for the specific purpose

12:56.260 --> 12:59.320
 of making sure that three little layers of neurons,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.660
 nerve cells got squeezed out

13:01.660 --> 13:04.200
 and form what are called your neural retinas.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.140
 Now the eyes have a lot of other goodies in them

13:06.140 --> 13:07.280
 that are very important.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.120
 And those are the goodies

13:08.120 --> 13:11.340
 that we're going to focus on a lot today.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.620
 There's a lens to focus light precisely to the retina.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.460
 If you're somebody who requires eyeglasses or contacts,

13:19.440 --> 13:22.340
 chances are you don't do that correctly.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.500
 And so that's why you use other lenses

13:24.500 --> 13:26.560
 like eyeglasses or contacts.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.060
 There are also other pieces of the eye

13:28.060 --> 13:30.520
 that are designed to keep the eye lubricated.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.800
 You also have these things that we call eyelashes.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.060
 Most people don't know this,

13:34.060 --> 13:37.960
 but eyelashes are there to trigger the blink reflex

13:37.960 --> 13:40.180
 if a piece of dust or something gets in front of your eye.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.300
 It's a beautiful adaptation of nature.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.880
 They aren't just aesthetically nice.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.900
 Costello happens to have very long eyelashes.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.280
 He gets compliments about this all the time.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.700
 Maybe you have long eyelashes.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.560
 I don't have particularly long eyelashes,

13:52.560 --> 13:54.260
 but the eyelashes are there

13:54.260 --> 13:56.220
 so that if a piece of dust or something

13:56.220 --> 13:57.860
 starts to head towards the cornea,

13:57.860 --> 13:59.660
 the eye blinks very, very fast.

13:59.660 --> 14:03.780
 It's the fastest reflex you own is your eye blink reflex.

14:03.780 --> 14:06.140
 We also have these things called eyelids.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.680
 Now, eyelids might seem like the most boring topic of all,

14:08.680 --> 14:10.460
 but they are incredibly fascinating.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.020
 Today, we're going to talk about

14:12.020 --> 14:14.740
 how you can actually use your visual system

14:14.740 --> 14:17.380
 to increase your levels of alertness

14:17.380 --> 14:19.380
 based on the neural circuits

14:19.380 --> 14:22.660
 that link your brainstem with your eyelids.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.800
 And no, we are not going to have a blinking contest

14:24.800 --> 14:27.020
 because I would win and you would lose,

14:27.020 --> 14:28.860
 and that wouldn't be fun for you.

14:28.860 --> 14:33.900
 So let's talk about what the eyes do for vision.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.260
 Basically, the entire job of the eyes

14:36.260 --> 14:38.620
 is to collect light information

14:38.620 --> 14:41.280
 and send it off to the rest of the brain

14:41.280 --> 14:43.140
 in a form that the brain can understand.

14:43.140 --> 14:45.580
 Remember, no light actually gets in

14:45.580 --> 14:47.020
 past those neural retinas.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.060
 It gets to the neural retina,

14:49.060 --> 14:51.680
 and we have specific cells in the eye

14:51.680 --> 14:52.820
 called photoreceptors.

14:52.820 --> 14:56.100
 They come in two different types, rods and cones.

14:56.100 --> 15:00.920
 Cones are mainly responsible for daytime vision,

15:00.920 --> 15:04.540
 and the rods are mainly responsible for vision at night

15:04.540 --> 15:07.200
 or under low light conditions, generally speaking.

15:08.160 --> 15:12.220
 So basically what happens is if your eyelids are open,

15:12.220 --> 15:17.220
 light comes into the eye, the lens focuses that light,

15:17.260 --> 15:19.580
 light is also just called photons, light energy,

15:19.580 --> 15:24.580
 onto the retina, these photoreceptors, the rods and cones,

15:24.780 --> 15:26.620
 have chemical reactions inside them

15:26.620 --> 15:28.720
 that involve things like vitamin A,

15:29.820 --> 15:33.860
 and that chemical reaction converts the light

15:33.860 --> 15:35.460
 into electricity.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.860
 Now, that might seem incredibly abstract,

15:37.860 --> 15:40.260
 but the way to think about this is very similar to,

15:40.260 --> 15:42.580
 for instance, you have touch receptors on your skin,

15:42.580 --> 15:44.580
 and when you press on those touch receptors,

15:44.580 --> 15:47.220
 they convert pressure, physical pressure,

15:47.220 --> 15:50.260
 into electrical information, and those neurons send it up

15:50.260 --> 15:52.740
 to your spinal cord and brain can register that somebody

15:52.740 --> 15:56.580
 or you are touching the top of your hand, as I'm doing now.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.840
 With the eyes and the retina,

15:57.840 --> 15:59.280
 it's just that light gets converted

15:59.280 --> 16:01.460
 into electrical information.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.460
 Within the eye, within the retina,

16:03.460 --> 16:06.800
 there are then a series of stages of processing,

16:07.660 --> 16:10.820
 and that information eventually gets sent into the brain

16:10.820 --> 16:13.420
 by a very specific class of neurons.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.820
 I would like you to know the names of these neurons.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.700
 They're called retinal ganglion cells,

16:17.700 --> 16:18.940
 so the only thing you need to know

16:18.940 --> 16:21.220
 about the neuroscience of the eye at this point

16:21.220 --> 16:22.920
 are that they're rods and cones.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.900
 The cones are involved in bright daytime vision,

16:25.900 --> 16:28.980
 and rods are involved in more dusk or nighttime vision,

16:29.900 --> 16:32.660
 and you've got these cells called retinal ganglion cells

16:32.660 --> 16:35.720
 that send the information off to the rest of the brain.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.360
 Now, here's what's incredible.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.000
 I just want you to ponder this for a second.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.460
 This still blows my mind.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.880
 Everything you see around you,

16:43.880 --> 16:47.640
 you're not actually seeing those objects directly.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.040
 What you're doing is you're making a best guess

16:51.040 --> 16:53.920
 about what's there based on the pattern of electricity

16:53.920 --> 16:55.900
 that arrives in your brain.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.880
 Now, that might just seem totally wild

16:57.880 --> 17:00.360
 and hard to wrap your head around,

17:00.360 --> 17:02.200
 but think about it this way,

17:02.200 --> 17:04.640
 because this is the way it actually works.

17:04.640 --> 17:09.460
 Let's take an example of a color like green or blue.

17:09.460 --> 17:14.260
 You have cones in your eye that respond best

17:14.260 --> 17:16.420
 to the wavelength of light

17:16.420 --> 17:19.520
 that is reflected off, say, a green apple.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.200
 So you don't actually see the green apple.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.460
 What you see is the light bouncing off that green apple,

17:24.460 --> 17:27.120
 and it goes into your eye,

17:27.120 --> 17:30.960
 and you see it and perceive it as round and green,

17:30.960 --> 17:33.640
 but not because you see anything green.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.400
 No green light arrives in your brain.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.560
 What happens is your brain actually compares

17:39.560 --> 17:43.600
 the amount of green reflection coming off that apple

17:43.600 --> 17:47.880
 to the amount of red and blue around it.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.160
 Well, you might say, well,

17:49.160 --> 17:51.360
 the green apple is sitting on a brown table

17:51.360 --> 17:53.080
 or a white surface.

17:53.080 --> 17:56.040
 Well, then it will appear very green

17:56.040 --> 18:00.080
 because the amount of wavelength of light for green

18:00.080 --> 18:03.980
 is very high, and the amount for red is very low,

18:03.980 --> 18:06.720
 and so it looks very green, okay?

18:06.720 --> 18:09.960
 So we don't actually see anything directly.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.280
 What the brain is receiving is a series of signals,

18:13.280 --> 18:16.960
 electrical signals, and it's comparing electrical signals

18:16.960 --> 18:19.100
 in order to come up with what we call these perceptions,

18:19.100 --> 18:21.860
 like I see something green, a green apple, or I see red.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.760
 Let me give you a slightly different example.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.620
 If you were to play a key on the piano,

18:26.620 --> 18:28.500
 let's say you play, I'm not a musician,

18:28.500 --> 18:29.340
 but I'm going to, so I'm,

18:29.340 --> 18:31.880
 hopefully I won't get this too incorrectly,

18:31.880 --> 18:34.280
 but let's say you have like E sharp,

18:34.280 --> 18:36.480
 and maybe it's on ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

18:36.480 --> 18:41.380
 If the brain gets that signal, it doesn't actually know E.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.640
 That's what, it doesn't recognize it

18:43.640 --> 18:46.520
 until you were to play another key next to it,

18:46.520 --> 18:47.880
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

18:47.880 --> 18:49.420
 and what it does is it does the math,

18:49.420 --> 18:53.040
 it does the subtraction, and it compares those two.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.800
 So when we see something green or we see something red

18:55.800 --> 18:57.240
 or we see something blue,

18:57.240 --> 18:58.720
 we're not actually seeing it directly.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.200
 The brain is making a guess

19:00.200 --> 19:02.860
 about how green or red or blue that thing is

19:02.860 --> 19:07.000
 by comparing what's around it, okay?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.780
 And if that seems hard to wrap your head around,

19:08.780 --> 19:11.400
 don't worry because we will explain it

19:11.400 --> 19:12.640
 in more depth going forward,

19:12.640 --> 19:14.720
 but I really want people to understand this,

19:14.720 --> 19:19.720
 that vision, eyesight is not looking at things directly

19:20.120 --> 19:22.400
 and that information getting directly into your brain.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.120
 It is translated.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.320
 Light information is transformed into electrical signals

19:27.320 --> 19:29.800
 that your visual system exquisitely understands.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.200
 Now, what does this mean?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.520
 Why should you care about this?

19:32.520 --> 19:36.240
 Well, if you have a dog like I do or a cat,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.040
 they are not colorblind,

19:38.040 --> 19:43.040
 but they lack the cones that respond to red,

19:43.160 --> 19:45.160
 meaning long wavelength light.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.720
 So what does that mean?

19:46.720 --> 19:48.840
 That means that when they see green,

19:48.840 --> 19:50.900
 it's different than the green you see,

19:51.960 --> 19:55.420
 not because that apple isn't visible to them,

19:55.420 --> 19:58.560
 but because they aren't able to compare it to red

19:58.560 --> 20:00.320
 and you are.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.160
 As a consequence, when they look at a green lawn,

20:03.160 --> 20:06.140
 it looks more brownish or orange to them.

20:06.140 --> 20:10.600
 When you wear a red shirt in front of your dog or cat,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.240
 if you see a stop sign and they see a stop sign,

20:13.240 --> 20:16.560
 they see orangish brown and you see red,

20:16.560 --> 20:18.400
 presuming that you are a trichromat,

20:18.400 --> 20:20.680
 meaning you have three color vision.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.000
 So this is all to say that every animal

20:24.000 --> 20:26.840
 sees the world differently depending on whether or not

20:26.840 --> 20:29.520
 they have one or two or three of these different cones,

20:29.520 --> 20:31.640
 the red, blue, or green cones.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.660
 If you are a mantis shrimp of all things,

20:35.660 --> 20:40.660
 you see hundreds of colors that human beings can't see.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.980
 Many animals see into visual ranges

20:45.980 --> 20:47.560
 that you and I can't see in.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.040
 So for instance, a pit viper senses heat emissions.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.180
 It literally sees the heat coming off of you

20:53.180 --> 20:55.760
 or of an animal that they want to eat.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.760
 If you are a ground squirrel, you can see ultraviolet light.

20:59.760 --> 21:00.820
 This is going to sound kind of weird,

21:00.820 --> 21:03.720
 but ground squirrels actually signal one another

21:03.720 --> 21:06.760
 by standing up outside and shining sunlight

21:06.760 --> 21:08.880
 off each other's stomachs to each other,

21:08.880 --> 21:10.760
 signaling at a distance, just like, you know,

21:10.760 --> 21:12.240
 you could signal somebody with a mirror

21:12.240 --> 21:13.960
 in sunlight at distance.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.240
 There are species of primates,

21:15.240 --> 21:16.640
 this isn't very pleasant to think about,

21:16.640 --> 21:18.160
 that urinate on their hands

21:18.160 --> 21:19.620
 and then wipe it all over their stomach

21:19.620 --> 21:22.160
 and then use that sunlight to reflect

21:22.160 --> 21:23.240
 different signals to each other.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.080
 I don't know what they're saying.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.680
 We always assume it's something cute and nice,

21:25.680 --> 21:27.600
 but maybe they're insulting each other.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.080
 So this actually gets right down to the heart

21:30.080 --> 21:32.220
 of these bigger questions like consciousness.

21:32.220 --> 21:33.080
 What do we see?

21:33.080 --> 21:33.920
 What's out there?

21:33.920 --> 21:38.160
 How much of life is really accessible to us?

21:38.160 --> 21:39.320
 And I could go on and on.

21:39.320 --> 21:42.160
 You know, this used to be kind of an obsession of mine

21:42.160 --> 21:44.220
 when I was coming up in the field of visual neuroscience

21:44.220 --> 21:45.800
 to understand how different animals

21:45.800 --> 21:48.320
 see the world compared to us.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.680
 You know, I'll give one more example, a diving bird,

21:50.680 --> 21:52.800
 you know, a bird that flies over the ocean.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.760
 It has an incredible task.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.920
 It has to both view the horizon

21:56.920 --> 21:58.560
 and it has to view schools of fish.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.840
 And then it has to make a trajectory down into the water

22:01.840 --> 22:03.520
 and grab one of those fish to eat.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.840
 And the water has what's called a refractory index.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.580
 It actually shifts like a prism,

22:08.580 --> 22:11.720
 the impression or the perception of where that fish is.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.040
 If the bird sees the fish right below it,

22:14.040 --> 22:17.940
 it has to know, it has to adjust its diving trajectory

22:17.940 --> 22:20.480
 just right because it knows that that fish

22:20.480 --> 22:22.500
 actually isn't where it sees it.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.280
 It's probably a few inches ahead or to the side of that

22:25.280 --> 22:29.160
 because of the way that water diverts the image.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.600
 If you've ever dropped a coin to the bottom of a pool,

22:31.600 --> 22:34.940
 if you go straight down looking at that location,

22:34.940 --> 22:36.320
 if you were to look from the top of the pool

22:36.320 --> 22:38.140
 and you dive straight down with your eyes closed,

22:38.140 --> 22:41.100
 you will miss because the water refracts.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.340
 It shifts the visual image.

22:43.340 --> 22:46.400
 Well, diving birds have an arrangement

22:46.400 --> 22:49.560
 of these retinal cells that communicate to the brain.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.760
 That's both a streak to view the horizon

22:51.760 --> 22:52.800
 because they need to know where they are

22:52.800 --> 22:53.840
 relative to the horizon.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.500
 And they have a pupil like we do on the bottom of their eye

22:56.500 --> 22:59.400
 so that they can make very accurate dive

22:59.400 --> 23:01.120
 and attacks on these schools of fish

23:01.120 --> 23:03.440
 and catch fish and eat those fish.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.920
 We just have pupils in the middle of our eyes.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.360
 So there's a ton about the optics of the eye

23:08.360 --> 23:10.500
 and the way that it communicates with the brain

23:10.500 --> 23:12.040
 that allows us to see.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.500
 We could spend hours talking about this,

23:13.500 --> 23:15.960
 but what I'd like to embed in your mind

23:15.960 --> 23:19.280
 is that what you experience in the outside world

23:19.280 --> 23:23.280
 is bottlenecked, it's limited by which wavelengths,

23:23.280 --> 23:26.740
 which colors, if you will, of light that you can see,

23:26.740 --> 23:28.960
 that your brain is coming up with a best guess

23:28.960 --> 23:32.840
 about what's there, it doesn't actually know what's there.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.080
 And that your vision is distinctly different

23:36.080 --> 23:38.120
 from say the vision of a dog

23:38.120 --> 23:40.160
 or from the vision of somebody who's a dichromat,

23:40.160 --> 23:42.520
 meaning they don't have a red cone.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.880
 A lot of people in particular about one in 80 males

23:46.880 --> 23:49.120
 lacks a red cone and therefore sees the world

23:49.120 --> 23:50.880
 much the same way that Costello does,

23:50.880 --> 23:53.780
 although he sees it from just much lower toward the ground.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.140
 So that's what I'd like you to understand

23:57.140 --> 23:59.960
 about the way the eye communicates with the brain.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.240
 I would also like you to understand

24:02.240 --> 24:06.860
 that the brain itself is making these guesses

24:06.860 --> 24:10.120
 and that those guesses are largely right.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.680
 How do I know that?

24:11.680 --> 24:13.220
 Well, they're right because when you reach out

24:13.220 --> 24:15.360
 to grab a glass, most of the time you grab the glass

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
 and you don't miss, right?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.220
 Most of the time when you make judgments

24:19.220 --> 24:20.560
 about the world around you

24:20.560 --> 24:23.580
 based on your visual impression of them,

24:23.580 --> 24:26.260
 it allows you to move functionally through the world.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.640
 But let me give you some examples

24:28.640 --> 24:31.800
 of where this guessing is happening right now.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.740
 And it's so incredible that to this day,

24:34.740 --> 24:35.960
 this still blows my mind.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.200
 Cover one eye with one hand,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.560
 if you're driving, maybe don't do this.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.300
 If you're viewing the world around you,

24:42.300 --> 24:44.940
 presumably you can see everything that's out there.

24:44.940 --> 24:47.120
 I could do this with one eye or the other eye.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.760
 You probably see better out of one or the other,

24:48.760 --> 24:50.080
 and we'll talk about that.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.840
 You have a giant blind spot

24:53.840 --> 24:56.320
 in the middle of your visual field.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.600
 It's called your blind spot.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.560
 It is the spot in which the connections,

24:59.560 --> 25:01.840
 the wires from all those retinal ganglion cells

25:01.840 --> 25:04.600
 exit the back of the eye and head off toward the brain.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.640
 In other words, you are blind

25:07.640 --> 25:10.020
 for a huge spot of your central vision,

25:10.020 --> 25:11.880
 the part of your vision that's highest acuity,

25:11.880 --> 25:15.560
 highest detail, and yet you don't see that ever.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.880
 You cover one eye and you see perfectly fine.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.080
 And it's not just because your eye

25:19.080 --> 25:20.640
 is moving around really quickly.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.900
 Your brain is guessing what's in that spot,

25:23.900 --> 25:25.500
 which is absolutely incredible.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.120
 And so you don't see that blind spot.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.300
 This is happening all the time.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.320
 Now, when you have two eyes open,

25:32.320 --> 25:34.140
 the way that your eyes are positioned in your head

25:34.140 --> 25:35.100
 and the way they view the world

25:35.100 --> 25:37.640
 is such that they fill in each other's blind spot.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.420
 So it's pretty convenient.

25:39.420 --> 25:42.520
 But if you cover one eye, that's impossible,

25:42.520 --> 25:45.540
 and yet you still see the world as complete.

25:45.540 --> 25:48.360
 So the brain is doing these incredible things.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.900
 It's also creating depth, a sense of depth,

25:50.900 --> 25:53.400
 even though what arrives from the retina

25:53.400 --> 25:56.520
 is essentially a readout of a two-dimensional flat image

25:56.520 --> 25:57.760
 so it can sense depth.

25:57.760 --> 25:58.800
 How do you know depth?

25:58.800 --> 26:01.080
 Well, this is very simple.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.520
 Things that are closer to you tend to be larger

26:03.520 --> 26:05.280
 than things that are far away.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.400
 Things that are closer to you

26:06.400 --> 26:08.480
 tend to look like they're moving faster.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.680
 If you've ever been in a train and you look to your side,

26:10.680 --> 26:14.080
 the rungs on a fence or the train tracks going by you

26:14.080 --> 26:15.280
 look like they're going very fast.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.160
 If you look off in the distance,

26:16.160 --> 26:18.200
 they look like they're moving very slowly.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.160
 And there are differences

26:21.160 --> 26:23.320
 between what's close to you and what's further away.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.880
 So a little house on the horizon,

26:24.880 --> 26:25.720
 you don't look at and say,

26:25.720 --> 26:27.700
 oh, that must be a tiny little house.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.240
 You have some prior knowledge

26:29.240 --> 26:31.660
 that things further away are smaller.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.120
 So that's the main way that you do that.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.600
 And you compare the location

26:36.600 --> 26:40.400
 at which information about light lands on the two eyes.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.520
 So your eyes are slightly offset from one another.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.160
 So that, for instance, if I look at you,

26:45.160 --> 26:46.760
 if you're standing right in front of me right now

26:46.760 --> 26:48.000
 and I were to look at you,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.660
 the image of your face,

26:49.660 --> 26:52.440
 the light bouncing off your face, to be more precise,

26:52.440 --> 26:55.560
 lands on one eye in a slightly different location

26:55.560 --> 26:56.960
 than it does in the other eye.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.880
 And then the brain does math.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.200
 It basically does the equivalent of geometry

27:02.200 --> 27:05.880
 and trigonometry and essentially figures out

27:05.880 --> 27:09.480
 how far away you are from me,

27:09.480 --> 27:10.500
 which is just incredible.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.040
 So the brain does all this very, very fast.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.160
 And the brain uses about 40 to 50%

27:16.160 --> 27:19.320
 of its total real estate for vision.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.940
 That's how important vision is.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.700
 Now, for those of you that are blind

27:22.700 --> 27:24.480
 or low vision or no vision,

27:24.480 --> 27:27.840
 that real estate in the brain will be taken over

27:27.840 --> 27:31.160
 by neurons that control a sense of touch

27:31.160 --> 27:32.120
 and a sense of hearing.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.800
 And you're indeed hearing and touch are much better,

27:34.800 --> 27:39.360
 higher acuity and faster in blind people.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.420
 But for most of you who I presume are sighted,

27:42.420 --> 27:44.140
 this is how it works.

27:44.140 --> 27:48.240
 So that's kind of vision from eye to brain in a nutshell.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.740
 There are a bunch of different stations in the brain

27:49.740 --> 27:50.720
 that do different things.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.480
 That's eyesight.

27:52.480 --> 27:56.480
 Now I want to talk about the other aspect of vision,

27:56.480 --> 27:58.720
 which is the stuff that you don't perceive,

27:58.720 --> 28:00.720
 the subconscious stuff.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.720
 And then we'll transition directly

28:02.720 --> 28:05.400
 into how you can use light and eyesight

28:05.400 --> 28:07.520
 to control this other stuff,

28:07.520 --> 28:10.460
 because it's very important in that other stuff

28:10.460 --> 28:13.880
 is mood, sleep, and appetite.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.040
 And there are ways in which you can use

28:16.040 --> 28:18.760
 the same protocols that I will describe

28:18.760 --> 28:22.520
 in order to preserve and even enhance your vision,

28:22.520 --> 28:26.440
 your ability to see things and consciously perceive them.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.500
 So the protocols we will describe have a lot of carry over

28:29.500 --> 28:32.280
 to both conscious eyesight

28:32.280 --> 28:35.420
 and to these subconscious aspects of vision.

28:35.420 --> 28:37.360
 And I just want you to understand a little bit more

28:37.360 --> 28:40.440
 about the science of seeing, of eyesight and vision,

28:40.440 --> 28:43.520
 and then all the protocols will make perfect sense.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.700
 So as amazing as eyesight is,

28:45.700 --> 28:50.000
 it actually did not evolve for us to see shapes and colors

28:50.000 --> 28:51.900
 and motion and form.

28:51.900 --> 28:56.040
 The most ancient cells in our eyes,

28:56.040 --> 28:58.640
 and the reason we have eyes,

28:58.640 --> 29:01.580
 is to communicate information about time of day

29:01.580 --> 29:03.760
 to the rest of the brain and body.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.040
 Remember, there's no extraocular photoreception.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.840
 There's no way for light information

29:07.840 --> 29:10.380
 to get to all the cells of your body,

29:10.380 --> 29:12.380
 but every cell in your body needs to know

29:12.380 --> 29:14.040
 if it's night or day.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.920
 I talked a little bit about this in the episodes on sleep,

29:17.920 --> 29:20.600
 and this episode is not about sleep,

29:20.600 --> 29:24.440
 but I want to emphasize that there is a particular category

29:24.440 --> 29:25.680
 of retinal ganglion cell.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.800
 Remember the neurons that connect the retina to the brain

29:30.080 --> 29:32.980
 that is involved in a special kind of vision

29:32.980 --> 29:35.000
 that has nothing to do with conscious perception

29:35.000 --> 29:37.760
 of what's around you, and it's happening right now.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.560
 It's happening all the time.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.120
 These are so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells

29:43.120 --> 29:46.220
 named after the opsin that they contain within them.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.120
 They are essentially photoreceptors.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.760
 Remember before I said there are photoreceptors

29:49.760 --> 29:50.720
 and then these ganglion cells?

29:50.720 --> 29:54.000
 Well, these melanopsin cells, as the name suggests,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.080
 melanopsin, have their own photoreceptor built inside them.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.480
 The opsin that they contain is actually very similar

30:03.480 --> 30:07.180
 to the melanopsin that is present in the skin

30:07.180 --> 30:12.180
 of some amphibians, and that causes those amphibians

30:12.600 --> 30:17.600
 to change their skin color in different light conditions.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.820
 So you have, believe it or not,

30:19.820 --> 30:24.820
 a little bit of frog skin in your eye, so to speak.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.660
 Not exactly, but you essentially have the equivalent

30:28.660 --> 30:31.740
 of what frogs have in their skin in your eye.

30:31.740 --> 30:35.980
 Now, if you are low vision or no vision,

30:37.200 --> 30:38.800
 as long as you have retinas,

30:38.800 --> 30:41.020
 it's very likely you still have these cells,

30:41.020 --> 30:44.380
 even though you can't see or you don't see well.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.460
 These cells, retinal ganglion cells,

30:46.460 --> 30:49.140
 communicate to areas of the brain

30:49.140 --> 30:52.140
 when particular qualities of light are present

30:52.140 --> 30:57.140
 in your environment and signal to the brain, therefore,

30:57.260 --> 31:00.480
 that it's early day or late in the day.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.080
 These melanopsin ganglion cells

31:03.080 --> 31:05.840
 are sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive cells

31:05.840 --> 31:08.500
 because they behave like photoreceptors.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.100
 What do these cells respond to

31:10.100 --> 31:11.480
 and why should you care about them?

31:11.480 --> 31:12.700
 Well, you should care about them

31:12.700 --> 31:14.680
 because they regulate when you'll get sleepy,

31:14.680 --> 31:18.600
 when you'll feel awake, how fast your metabolism is,

31:18.600 --> 31:22.520
 excuse me, your blood sugar levels, your dopamine levels,

31:22.520 --> 31:24.480
 and your pain threshold.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.280
 There are other factors that impact those things,

31:27.280 --> 31:30.380
 but they are one of the, if not the most powerful

31:30.380 --> 31:32.840
 determinant of those other things,

31:32.840 --> 31:35.200
 like mood and pain threshold, sleepiness,

31:35.200 --> 31:36.440
 wakefulness, et cetera.

31:37.580 --> 31:41.000
 These melanopsin ganglion cells have been shown

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
 by the NITZ group, N-E-I-T-Z,

31:46.000 --> 31:47.320
 up at the University of Washington

31:47.320 --> 31:49.740
 and by Samir Hattar's lab and David Berson's lab

31:49.740 --> 31:51.280
 and a number of other people's labs,

31:51.280 --> 31:54.360
 Sachin Panda, Iggy Provencio, et cetera,

31:54.360 --> 31:56.600
 a number of excellent labs in neuroscience

31:56.600 --> 32:01.460
 to set the circadian clock and to respond best

32:02.460 --> 32:05.800
 to the contrast between blue and yellow light

32:05.800 --> 32:10.200
 of the sort that lands on these cells

32:10.200 --> 32:13.120
 when you view the sun, when it's at so-called

32:13.120 --> 32:15.280
 low solar angle, when it's low in the sky,

32:15.280 --> 32:18.180
 either in the morning or in the evening.

32:18.180 --> 32:19.360
 What does all this mean?

32:19.360 --> 32:21.520
 It means, and here's the first protocol,

32:21.520 --> 32:23.900
 and you've probably heard me say this before,

32:23.900 --> 32:26.640
 but it is appropriate to this episode to say it again.

32:27.800 --> 32:32.280
 If you are not viewing the sun, sunlight,

32:32.280 --> 32:36.080
 even through cloud cover for two to 10 minutes

32:36.080 --> 32:37.360
 in the early part of the day

32:37.360 --> 32:39.620
 when the sun is still low in the sky

32:39.620 --> 32:42.200
 and doing the same thing again in the evening,

32:42.200 --> 32:45.840
 you are severely disrupting your sleep rhythms,

32:45.840 --> 32:49.160
 your mood, your hormones, your metabolism,

32:49.160 --> 32:51.600
 your pain threshold, and many other factors,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.760
 including your ability to learn and remember information.

32:54.760 --> 32:58.480
 The most central and important aspect of our biology,

32:58.480 --> 33:00.440
 and perhaps our psychology as well,

33:00.440 --> 33:05.440
 is to anchor ourselves in time to know when we exist.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.720
 Okay, it sounds a little bit abstract and philosophical,

33:10.720 --> 33:11.560
 but it's not.

33:11.560 --> 33:15.520
 And we don't know time as a real thing

33:15.520 --> 33:16.740
 because of watches and clocks.

33:16.740 --> 33:19.360
 We know time at a biological level

33:19.360 --> 33:22.320
 based on where the sun is and where,

33:22.320 --> 33:25.240
 which of course is where we are relative to the sun

33:25.240 --> 33:26.800
 because the earth is spinning around.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.300
 Now, what does this mean for a protocol?

33:29.300 --> 33:33.620
 It means see, get that light in your eyes early in the day

33:33.620 --> 33:35.140
 and anytime you want to be awake.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.840
 So try and get as much sunlight in your eyes

33:36.840 --> 33:38.160
 during the day as you safely can.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.280
 We'll talk about eye safety this episode in depth.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.820
 And the blue light and the contrast of that blue-yellow,

33:45.820 --> 33:47.380
 remember, we don't see blue.

33:47.380 --> 33:48.920
 This is all subconscious.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.100
 This is blue reflections coming off of sunlight.

33:51.100 --> 33:53.120
 Blue light, we've been told, is so terrible for us.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.800
 It is absolutely essential and wonderful

33:54.800 --> 33:56.280
 for waking up the brain,

33:56.280 --> 33:59.300
 for triggering all sorts of positive biological reactions,

33:59.300 --> 34:01.620
 but it needs to be viewed early in the day.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.800
 If you can't see sunlight

34:02.800 --> 34:05.080
 because it's the thick cloud cover of,

34:05.080 --> 34:08.380
 say, you're in the UK and it's winter,

34:08.380 --> 34:11.600
 then artificial lights, especially blue lights,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.520
 would be very beneficial to you.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.920
 You need a lot of this light and its contrast with yellow

34:16.920 --> 34:19.160
 in order to trigger these melanopsin cells,

34:19.160 --> 34:21.560
 which would then trigger your circadian clock,

34:21.560 --> 34:22.700
 which sits above the roof of your mouth,

34:22.700 --> 34:24.760
 which will signal every cell in your body,

34:24.760 --> 34:27.060
 including temperature rhythms, et cetera.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.420
 So first things first,

34:28.420 --> 34:33.420
 your visual system was not for seeing faces, motion, et cetera.

34:33.940 --> 34:36.080
 The most ancient cells in your eye,

34:36.960 --> 34:38.920
 which are there right now as we speak,

34:38.920 --> 34:43.920
 are there to inform your body and brain about time of day.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.520
 So you want to get that bright light early in the day.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.100
 Absolutely essential, two to 10 minutes.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.100
 You can download the light meter app

34:50.100 --> 34:51.680
 if you want to measure lux.

34:51.680 --> 34:54.240
 When I explained how to do that in earlier episodes,

34:54.240 --> 34:56.040
 it got a little convoluted.

34:56.040 --> 34:59.040
 Get that two to 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.460
 Now, here's another reason to do this,

35:01.460 --> 35:04.680
 and I've never spoken about this before on any podcast,

35:04.680 --> 35:07.460
 which is that there have been several studies now

35:07.460 --> 35:11.960
 in thousands of subjects exploring what can be done

35:11.960 --> 35:15.380
 to prevent myopia, nearsightedness,

35:15.380 --> 35:17.120
 and other visual defects.

35:18.200 --> 35:22.480
 And it turns out in a series of large clinical trials,

35:22.480 --> 35:27.000
 the conclusion has emerged that getting two hours a day

35:27.000 --> 35:30.360
 of outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light,

35:30.360 --> 35:32.920
 this blue light that everyone has demonized,

35:32.920 --> 35:36.340
 getting that sunlight during the day for two hours,

35:36.340 --> 35:37.960
 even if you're reading other things

35:37.960 --> 35:39.920
 and doing other things outside,

35:39.920 --> 35:44.560
 has a significant effect on reducing the probability

35:44.560 --> 35:47.480
 that you will get myopia, nearsightedness.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.780
 Now, whether or not that's also due to the fact

35:50.780 --> 35:52.840
 that myopia can be caused by viewing things

35:52.840 --> 35:54.600
 up close too much.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.500
 So if you're indoors,

35:55.500 --> 35:57.280
 we tend to be looking at things more closely, right?

35:57.280 --> 35:58.700
 Unless you have a very large house

35:58.700 --> 36:00.840
 with walls that are very far away from you.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.760
 But the effect does seem to be directly related

36:04.760 --> 36:06.120
 to getting sunlight

36:06.120 --> 36:08.720
 and not just to the distance that you're viewing.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.680
 I'm going to describe this study just briefly,

36:10.680 --> 36:11.980
 but this is a second protocol.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.680
 So we have one protocol about getting sunlight

36:13.680 --> 36:16.680
 to set your circadian clocks, meaning wake you up,

36:16.680 --> 36:18.400
 establish your sleep,

36:18.400 --> 36:20.520
 will occur about 12 to 16 hours later,

36:20.520 --> 36:21.640
 that's all in the sleep episode,

36:21.640 --> 36:24.800
 but also to enhance your mood, to enhance your metabolism,

36:24.800 --> 36:26.920
 to optimize your hormone levels,

36:26.920 --> 36:28.960
 and to optimize learning and dopamine levels,

36:28.960 --> 36:31.640
 this feel-good neuromodulator that's essential

36:31.640 --> 36:34.780
 to not getting depressed, et cetera.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.680
 But now's a second protocol, which is ideally,

36:39.680 --> 36:40.860
 and this includes children,

36:40.860 --> 36:43.560
 as long as they're not very small infants,

36:43.560 --> 36:46.880
 ideally, we're all getting two hours of outdoor time,

36:46.880 --> 36:48.660
 even if there's cloud cover.

36:48.660 --> 36:52.000
 Remember, we evolved mostly under outdoor conditions,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.360
 not indoor conditions.

36:53.360 --> 36:57.920
 And no artificial blue light will not replace this aspect

36:57.920 --> 37:01.460
 of your visual system and offsetting myopia.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.240
 So I just want to briefly describe this study

37:03.240 --> 37:04.440
 because it's a very important one

37:04.440 --> 37:07.040
 and I don't think it's discussed often enough.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.520
 There are many studies exploring this,

37:08.520 --> 37:11.080
 but one of the ones I like the most

37:11.080 --> 37:16.080
 looked at 693 students and a subset of them

37:16.840 --> 37:21.080
 were encouraged to spend 11 hours a week outdoors, okay?

37:21.080 --> 37:24.500
 So most kids are in school five days a week or so.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.060
 So they're spending 11 hours a week outdoors.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.400
 They are sometimes reading outdoors.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.800
 They're not always just playing outdoors.

37:29.800 --> 37:33.000
 They might be reading books, et cetera.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.320
 They used eight different schools.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.620
 And the reason they did this study,

37:37.620 --> 37:38.520
 I probably should have mentioned,

37:38.520 --> 37:41.520
 is that myopia, nearsightedness, is a global epidemic.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.820
 At least that's how it was referred to in the study.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.020
 I don't know who decides what's an epidemic or not.

37:46.020 --> 37:47.920
 I think there are thresholds for that.

37:48.920 --> 37:53.920
 This paper published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018

37:54.040 --> 37:58.580
 described the fact that being outdoors for two hours a day

37:58.580 --> 38:01.340
 could significantly reduce the probability

38:01.340 --> 38:04.580
 that these children would develop nearsightedness.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.000
 And it turns out, based on other studies,

38:07.000 --> 38:10.440
 that adults who spend two hours a day outside,

38:10.440 --> 38:13.400
 so that would be reading outside, talking outside,

38:13.400 --> 38:14.920
 no, it does not include light

38:14.920 --> 38:16.640
 coming through the windshield of your car.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.340
 I'll explain why in a few moments.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.540
 Offset the formation of myopia.

38:23.540 --> 38:26.280
 Now, myopia or nearsightedness has to do with

38:26.280 --> 38:31.280
 the way that the lens focuses light onto the retina.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.520
 I don't want to get into a long description of this now,

38:33.520 --> 38:37.080
 but basically the lens has to bring light to the retina,

38:37.080 --> 38:39.480
 not in front of it, not behind it.

38:39.480 --> 38:43.220
 If it brings light to a position in front of the retina,

38:43.220 --> 38:44.740
 then you won't see clearly.

38:44.740 --> 38:47.000
 You will need corrective lenses.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.880
 If it brings light directly to the retina,

38:48.880 --> 38:50.180
 then you will see clearly.

38:50.180 --> 38:53.180
 That should be intuitive why that makes sense.

38:53.180 --> 38:55.320
 So you might say, why would being outside,

38:55.320 --> 38:58.660
 getting this blue light or this blue-yellow contrast

38:58.660 --> 39:02.560
 from sunlight actually offset myopia?

39:02.560 --> 39:05.680
 Well, it probably, and I want to emphasize probably,

39:05.680 --> 39:06.680
 has to do with the fact

39:06.680 --> 39:08.360
 that these melanopsin ganglion cells,

39:08.360 --> 39:10.120
 these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells

39:10.120 --> 39:13.080
 are not just responsible for sleep

39:13.080 --> 39:15.720
 and talking to your circadian clock and that sort of thing.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.320
 They also make connections within the retina.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.420
 They connect to things like, this is for the aficionados,

39:21.420 --> 39:25.440
 the ciliary body, the iris, the muscles,

39:25.440 --> 39:26.760
 and the structures within the eye

39:26.760 --> 39:29.000
 that actually move the lens

39:29.000 --> 39:32.800
 and allow you to adjust your vision to things up close

39:32.800 --> 39:34.200
 or far away.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.980
 And in doing so, they increase or improve the health

39:37.980 --> 39:40.820
 of the little tiny muscles within the eye

39:40.820 --> 39:42.840
 that move the lens.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.800
 And they probably, again,

39:44.800 --> 39:46.620
 this needs a little bit more work

39:46.620 --> 39:48.720
 in order to really tamp down the mechanism.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.700
 They're probably also involved in bringing growth factors

39:52.700 --> 39:57.540
 and blood supply to the muscles and to the neurons

39:57.540 --> 40:01.640
 that are responsible for this focusing mechanism

40:01.640 --> 40:02.780
 within the eye.

40:02.780 --> 40:05.620
 So remember, your eye is an optical device.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.660
 You were born with lenses.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.360
 You don't have to use glasses, or maybe you do,

40:08.360 --> 40:10.280
 because you have lenses in your eyes.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.780
 And those lenses need to move.

40:11.780 --> 40:14.440
 It's not a rigid lens like a glass lens.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.800
 It's a dynamic lens and has little muscles

40:16.800 --> 40:18.640
 that pull on it and squeeze it

40:18.640 --> 40:21.420
 and make it thicker or thinner

40:21.420 --> 40:23.240
 as you look at things close and far away.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.220
 And I'll describe how that works in a moment.

40:25.220 --> 40:30.120
 These melanopsin cells and their activation by sunlight,

40:30.120 --> 40:33.500
 completely subconsciously, unaware, you're unaware of this,

40:34.360 --> 40:38.160
 promote the health of this system within the eye

40:38.160 --> 40:43.000
 and allow you to offset the myopia, nearsightedness.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.200
 In other words, getting outside for two hours a day,

40:46.200 --> 40:48.080
 each day, on average,

40:48.080 --> 40:51.560
 even if there's cloud cover without sunglasses on,

40:51.560 --> 40:56.560
 will allow you to offset the formation of myopia.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.480
 Now, you might still form myopia

40:58.480 --> 41:00.160
 if you have certain structural features

41:00.160 --> 41:01.340
 or genetic basis for that.

41:01.340 --> 41:03.560
 We will talk about things that you can do as well.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.800
 But for everybody, we should be doing this.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.240
 And that might seem like a lot,

41:07.240 --> 41:09.640
 but this is the way that your visual system works.

41:09.640 --> 41:13.080
 Staying indoors, just getting artificial light,

41:13.080 --> 41:17.720
 and looking at things up close leads to visual defects, okay?

41:17.720 --> 41:21.080
 It's a form of kind of like visual obesity, right?

41:21.080 --> 41:23.600
 The posture of your visual system, if you will,

41:23.600 --> 41:26.080
 is going to be unhealthy if you're just indoors

41:26.080 --> 41:28.240
 and you're not getting sunlight early in the day

41:28.240 --> 41:30.760
 and for at least two hours per day.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.840
 I want to talk a little bit more about how our eyes adjust

41:33.840 --> 41:36.180
 to things that are close to us or far away.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.220
 This is an absolutely brilliant consequence

41:40.220 --> 41:42.660
 of our nature and our design.

41:42.660 --> 41:44.640
 And whenever I say nature and design,

41:44.640 --> 41:46.240
 people always ask me, you know,

41:46.240 --> 41:47.440
 what are you really trying to say?

41:47.440 --> 41:49.920
 Are you trying to talk about creators?

41:49.920 --> 41:51.400
 Are you talking about intelligent design?

41:51.400 --> 41:53.720
 Look, I want to be very frank with you.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.960
 I wasn't consulted at the design phase and neither were you.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.120
 And so that is all very interesting,

41:59.120 --> 42:01.220
 but it's not the topic of this discussion.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.600
 What is clear and what is the topic of this discussion

42:05.600 --> 42:10.600
 is that the eye can dynamically adjust where light lands

42:10.640 --> 42:12.720
 by moving the lens and changing the shape

42:12.720 --> 42:14.080
 of the lens in your eye

42:14.080 --> 42:16.760
 through a process called accommodation.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.780
 And if you understand this process of accommodation,

42:19.780 --> 42:22.880
 you not only can enhance the health of your eyes

42:22.880 --> 42:26.800
 in the immediate and long-term, but you also can work better.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.880
 You'll be able to focus better on physical and mental work.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.800
 You will be able to concentrate for longer.

42:32.800 --> 42:37.000
 And I want to emphasize that so much of our mental focus,

42:37.000 --> 42:38.800
 whether or not it's for cognitive endeavors

42:38.800 --> 42:40.160
 or physical endeavors,

42:41.240 --> 42:45.200
 is grounded in where we place our visual focus, okay?

42:45.200 --> 42:46.960
 What we look at and our ability

42:46.960 --> 42:50.580
 to hold our concentration there is critically

42:50.580 --> 42:53.780
 determining how we think.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.920
 So in other words, if you can hold visual focus,

42:56.920 --> 42:59.520
 you can hold mental focus, cognitive focus,

42:59.520 --> 43:01.800
 but holding visual focus is challenging.

43:01.800 --> 43:06.800
 It's tiring because it requires movement of the lens

43:07.240 --> 43:10.180
 and that movement of the lens requires activation of muscles

43:10.180 --> 43:11.360
 and the activation of muscles,

43:11.360 --> 43:13.880
 as you know from the physical performance episodes,

43:13.880 --> 43:15.440
 if you saw them and even if you don't,

43:15.440 --> 43:17.520
 is dictated by neurons.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.180
 So what is accommodation?

43:19.180 --> 43:24.160
 Well, it's actually very simple and very elegant.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.880
 And again, this is another case

43:25.880 --> 43:27.520
 where whenever I look at this stuff,

43:27.520 --> 43:29.160
 even though I've been looking at it for years,

43:29.160 --> 43:30.280
 learning about it for years,

43:30.280 --> 43:31.680
 it still boggles my mind

43:31.680 --> 43:35.700
 that we have these apparatus built into our eyes.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.400
 So we have lenses in our eyes

43:37.400 --> 43:39.680
 and we have these things called the irises.

43:39.680 --> 43:40.980
 You're all familiar with the iris

43:40.980 --> 43:44.100
 because you'll see people's pupils get bigger or smaller

43:44.100 --> 43:47.960
 and we intuitively think of eyes as having the pupils.

43:47.960 --> 43:52.080
 If you actually draw two circles on a sheet of paper

43:52.080 --> 43:53.920
 and they look like two circles,

43:53.920 --> 43:55.760
 but if you put little dots in the middle of them,

43:55.760 --> 43:56.960
 they look like eyes.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.780
 Your brain recognizes those as eyes

43:58.780 --> 44:00.080
 because one of the first things you see

44:00.080 --> 44:01.960
 when you come into this world are eyes.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.520
 And actually, if you put the little dots close together,

44:04.520 --> 44:06.920
 it'll look kind of wrong, like it's cross-eyed.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.160
 And if you put them at different locations

44:09.160 --> 44:11.040
 within those two dots, opposing locations,

44:11.040 --> 44:12.080
 it'll look Google-eyed.

44:12.080 --> 44:14.160
 And so your brain is actually filling in all the face

44:14.160 --> 44:16.800
 and other information, even emotional information,

44:16.800 --> 44:19.360
 just based on this recognition of eyes.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.600
 And so there's clearly, we know this,

44:21.600 --> 44:24.720
 there's real estate further up in the brain

44:24.720 --> 44:29.340
 that's responsible for analyzing and recognizing faces

44:29.340 --> 44:31.640
 and the eyes and the position of these little things

44:31.640 --> 44:33.840
 we call irises and pupils, et cetera,

44:33.840 --> 44:36.900
 is really important for how we interpret

44:36.900 --> 44:39.480
 the status of others.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.980
 And that's why it's such a powerful thing

44:40.980 --> 44:42.360
 just to put two circles

44:42.360 --> 44:45.680
 and move the pupils around on paper.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.960
 In fact, I want to get into a combination,

44:47.960 --> 44:49.220
 but if you think about it,

44:49.220 --> 44:50.900
 if one of my pupils was up there

44:50.900 --> 44:51.920
 and the other one was down there,

44:51.920 --> 44:53.600
 one was really big and one was really small,

44:53.600 --> 44:55.940
 that would actually be a sign of pretty severe damage.

44:55.940 --> 44:58.060
 If someone gets hit hard on the side of the head,

44:58.060 --> 45:00.840
 you'll notice that they shine a light in one eye.

45:00.840 --> 45:01.740
 You know why they're doing that?

45:01.740 --> 45:04.360
 They're actually looking at the other eye.

45:04.360 --> 45:05.400
 When you shine light of the eye,

45:05.400 --> 45:07.800
 that pupil constricts to limit the amount of light

45:07.800 --> 45:09.640
 that comes in so it doesn't damage the eye.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.780
 This also happens when you walk outside and it's bright.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.440
 It constricts,

45:13.440 --> 45:16.120
 but we have what's called the consensual pupil reflex.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.060
 There's a connection deep in the brainstem,

45:18.060 --> 45:20.460
 deep back here in the brain near my neck

45:20.460 --> 45:24.000
 that connects the pupil mechanism for the two eyes

45:24.000 --> 45:25.040
 and they're looking at the other eye.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.020
 And if you shine light in one eye

45:27.020 --> 45:29.120
 and that pupil constricts, but the other one doesn't,

45:29.120 --> 45:31.560
 there's a good chance there's brainstem damage.

45:31.560 --> 45:34.040
 This is what they do on the side of a football field

45:34.040 --> 45:35.080
 or a boxing match,

45:35.080 --> 45:37.760
 or if someone unfortunately hits their head.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.720
 So two pupils, and don't freak out

45:39.720 --> 45:42.440
 if one pupil is a little bit smaller than the other,

45:42.440 --> 45:44.000
 that doesn't necessarily mean brain damage.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.880
 But if you suddenly have one pupil bigger than the other,

45:46.880 --> 45:49.800
 you absolutely want to go see a neurologist right away.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.120
 So the eyes and the pupils are indicative

45:52.120 --> 45:54.780
 of things that are happening deep in the brain.

45:54.780 --> 45:58.520
 Now, accommodation is our ability to accommodate

45:58.520 --> 46:02.060
 to things that are up close here or further away.

46:02.060 --> 46:04.520
 And the way this works is that the iris

46:04.520 --> 46:06.520
 and the musculature and a structure

46:06.520 --> 46:08.640
 called the ciliary body move the lens.

46:08.640 --> 46:10.940
 So when you look far away, okay,

46:10.940 --> 46:15.940
 when you see things far away, your lens actually relaxes.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.920
 It can flatten out.

46:17.920 --> 46:18.760
 So I want you to think about this.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.360
 When you look far away,

46:20.360 --> 46:23.720
 when it may be anywhere from like 20 feet away from you

46:23.720 --> 46:27.960
 out to a horizon that's miles or kilometers away from you,

46:27.960 --> 46:29.440
 the lens can just relax.

46:29.440 --> 46:30.960
 It can flatten out.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.280
 And you'll notice that it actually is relaxing

46:33.280 --> 46:35.080
 to look at a horizon.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.820
 It's relaxing to look far away.

46:36.820 --> 46:38.940
 Whereas if I look at something up close to me,

46:38.940 --> 46:41.680
 like this pen or my phone or a computer screen

46:41.680 --> 46:44.840
 or this microphone, it takes effort.

46:44.840 --> 46:46.440
 You'll sense the effort.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.660
 Now, some of that effort is actually eye movements

46:48.660 --> 46:50.360
 because you have muscles that can move your eyes

46:50.360 --> 46:52.160
 within their sockets.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.640
 But a lot of the work, quote unquote, is neural work

46:55.640 --> 46:59.280
 of the muscles having to move and contract

46:59.280 --> 47:02.400
 such that the lens actually gets thicker

47:02.400 --> 47:05.500
 in order to bring the light to the retina

47:05.500 --> 47:08.240
 and not to a location in front of it or behind it,

47:08.240 --> 47:10.240
 so-called accommodation.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.280
 There's also changes in the size of the pupil

47:12.280 --> 47:14.760
 as things are closer and further away from you.

47:14.760 --> 47:18.320
 In fact, there's a simple way to think about this.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.920
 Healthy pupils are going to dilate

47:20.920 --> 47:23.520
 when you look at something far away from you.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.600
 Now, when you see something that excites you

47:25.600 --> 47:28.200
 or stresses you out, your pupils also get big.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.280
 Your eyes get wide.

47:29.280 --> 47:33.460
 But if you look at something far away,

47:33.460 --> 47:35.680
 your pupils are going to dilate.

47:35.680 --> 47:38.140
 And when you look at things that are closer to you,

47:38.140 --> 47:39.040
 when you move them up close,

47:39.040 --> 47:40.600
 the pupils are going to shrink.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.520
 That's all part of this accommodation mechanism.

47:43.520 --> 47:44.960
 Now, you might say,

47:44.960 --> 47:46.560
 why are you telling me about accommodation?

47:46.560 --> 47:47.400
 This is crazy.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.240
 Why are you telling me about this?

47:48.240 --> 47:51.680
 Well, these days we're spending a lot of time

47:51.680 --> 47:53.960
 looking at things, mainly our phones up close

47:53.960 --> 47:56.760
 and computers up close, and we are indoors.

47:56.760 --> 48:00.800
 If you are a young person, and even if you are 25 or older,

48:00.800 --> 48:02.480
 and you are spending a lot of time

48:02.480 --> 48:04.280
 looking at things up close,

48:04.280 --> 48:08.180
 and you are not allowing your vision to relax,

48:08.180 --> 48:10.440
 in other words, you are not giving your lens

48:10.440 --> 48:11.800
 the opportunity to flatten out

48:11.800 --> 48:15.040
 and for these muscles to relieve themselves of this work,

48:15.960 --> 48:17.760
 you may or may not have migraine headaches.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.780
 You may or may not have headaches.

48:19.780 --> 48:22.600
 You might, and that could be the cause of those.

48:22.600 --> 48:27.100
 But you are also training your eyes

48:28.100 --> 48:32.840
 to be good at looking at things up close and not far away.

48:32.840 --> 48:33.920
 And as a consequence,

48:33.920 --> 48:37.200
 you are reshaping the neural circuitry in your brain,

48:37.200 --> 48:40.880
 and it is not good, it is not healthy,

48:40.880 --> 48:43.640
 to only look at things up close.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.800
 Now, there are a lot of recommendations out there right now,

48:45.800 --> 48:49.560
 especially with all the lockdowns of the last 12 to 18 months

48:49.560 --> 48:51.580
 that people should look up from Zoom every once in a while,

48:51.580 --> 48:53.700
 or maybe now I'm hearing that people should take calls

48:53.700 --> 48:55.000
 instead of doing Zoom,

48:55.000 --> 48:56.580
 or you should look up from your computer screen.

48:56.580 --> 48:59.680
 It's actually not going to solve the problem

48:59.680 --> 49:01.600
 just to look up from your computer screen.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.860
 You need to go to a window.

49:02.860 --> 49:05.400
 You need to look out at a distance.

49:05.400 --> 49:08.120
 Ideally, you would even open the window

49:08.120 --> 49:10.480
 because those windows actually filter out

49:10.480 --> 49:13.400
 a lot of the blue light that you want during the daytime,

49:13.400 --> 49:14.520
 a lot of the sunlight.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.120
 It's actually 50 times less gets through.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.440
 You want to get out onto a balcony.

49:18.440 --> 49:21.520
 You want to relax your eyes and look out at the horizon.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.400
 You want to go into what's called panoramic vision

49:23.400 --> 49:25.000
 and let your vision expand.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.280
 You want this lens mechanism to be very elastic.

49:28.280 --> 49:31.200
 You don't want it to get stuck in that configuration

49:31.200 --> 49:32.300
 of looking at things up close.

49:32.300 --> 49:35.260
 Accommodation is a wonderful feature of your visual system,

49:35.260 --> 49:38.160
 but you don't want to push that too hard,

49:38.160 --> 49:40.620
 too often or for too long.

49:41.820 --> 49:44.000
 You want to view the horizon.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.320
 You want to get outside,

49:45.320 --> 49:48.720
 not just to lighten the load on your mind

49:48.720 --> 49:49.960
 or to think about other things,

49:49.960 --> 49:54.260
 but to maintain the health of your visual system.

49:54.260 --> 49:58.760
 In other words, you want to exercise these muscles

49:58.760 --> 50:02.140
 and that involves both the lens moving

50:02.140 --> 50:05.640
 and getting kind of thicker and relaxing that lens.

50:05.640 --> 50:06.920
 And the relaxation of the lens

50:06.920 --> 50:08.560
 is actually one of the best things you can do

50:08.560 --> 50:10.920
 for the musculature of the inner eye.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.800
 So what's the protocol?

50:12.800 --> 50:14.920
 How often should you do this?

50:14.920 --> 50:15.820
 You might be surprised,

50:15.820 --> 50:19.060
 but for every 30 minutes of focused work,

50:19.060 --> 50:21.200
 you probably want to look up every once in a while

50:21.200 --> 50:23.200
 and just try and relax your face and eye muscles,

50:23.200 --> 50:24.420
 including your jaw muscles,

50:24.420 --> 50:26.360
 because all these things are closely linked

50:26.360 --> 50:28.900
 in the brainstem and allow your eyes

50:28.900 --> 50:30.580
 to go into so-called panoramic vision,

50:30.580 --> 50:32.320
 where you're just not really focusing on anything

50:32.320 --> 50:34.800
 and then refocus on your work.

50:34.800 --> 50:39.800
 At least every 90 minutes of looking at things up close,

50:40.680 --> 50:42.840
 or even if you're looking at a screen,

50:42.840 --> 50:45.680
 a television screen or you're watching a movie

50:45.680 --> 50:49.160
 or you're indoors, for every 90 minutes of that,

50:49.160 --> 50:53.480
 you ideally would have at least 20,

50:53.480 --> 50:57.360
 probably more like 30 minutes of being outside, ideally,

50:57.360 --> 51:02.040
 but if you can't be outside, of non up close vision.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.220
 Now you might say, that's impossible.

51:03.220 --> 51:04.520
 How am I supposed to do that?

51:04.520 --> 51:05.940
 I'm in an office or I'm in a building.

51:05.940 --> 51:09.520
 Get to a window, get outside if you can do it safely,

51:09.520 --> 51:13.900
 get onto a balcony and just let your eyes relax.

51:13.900 --> 51:17.020
 Many people are experiencing severe vision problems

51:18.000 --> 51:20.160
 because they're not getting enough sunlight during the day.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.360
 They have sleep problems

51:21.360 --> 51:24.640
 because they're not viewing sunlight early in the day.

51:24.640 --> 51:27.840
 And as I've mentioned in previous episodes,

51:27.840 --> 51:30.140
 they're getting a lot of artificial stimulation,

51:30.140 --> 51:31.660
 artificial light stimulation of the eye

51:31.660 --> 51:33.760
 in the middle of the night.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.880
 All of this is through the visual system.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.920
 So migraines, fatigue,

51:38.880 --> 51:42.280
 challenges with your eyesight getting worse as you age,

51:42.280 --> 51:43.880
 or even in young people there's a, you know,

51:43.880 --> 51:45.520
 at least according to the articles,

51:45.520 --> 51:48.480
 they described it as this epidemic of myopia

51:48.480 --> 51:52.460
 can largely be dealt with by getting outside,

51:52.460 --> 51:54.280
 going into panoramic vision,

51:54.280 --> 51:56.800
 experiencing some distance division,

51:56.800 --> 51:59.000
 look at things off on the horizon.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.940
 If you're walking or hiking or biking,

52:00.940 --> 52:02.500
 not looking at your phone the whole time

52:02.500 --> 52:03.600
 that you're doing that.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.240
 If you're at the bus stop or you're commuting,

52:06.240 --> 52:07.920
 certainly not looking at your phone

52:07.920 --> 52:10.200
 the entire time you're doing that.

52:10.200 --> 52:11.480
 So this is vital.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.720
 And I want to emphasize another protocol,

52:13.720 --> 52:15.320
 although I don't want to get into it in too much depth,

52:15.320 --> 52:17.500
 because I want to make sure that I also talk about

52:17.500 --> 52:19.500
 a number of other important aspects of the visual system

52:19.500 --> 52:21.320
 that are more related to sight.

52:21.320 --> 52:25.920
 But getting into optic flow is very important

52:25.920 --> 52:28.220
 for de-stressing your system.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.720
 When you move through space,

52:30.720 --> 52:34.560
 whether or not it's through walking, biking, even swimming,

52:34.560 --> 52:37.480
 if it's self-generated optic flow,

52:37.480 --> 52:40.080
 so probably not driving or motorcycling,

52:40.080 --> 52:43.800
 but yes, bicycling or, I don't know, unicycling.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.960
 I don't know why I thought about unicycling.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.260
 There used to be a graduate student at Stanford

52:46.260 --> 52:47.640
 who was a really impressive unicycler.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.800
 Those are pretty rare.

52:49.900 --> 52:51.920
 As long as it's self-generated optic flow,

52:51.920 --> 52:54.520
 meaning you're generating motion of your body

52:54.520 --> 52:57.560
 and the visual images around you are passing by

52:57.560 --> 53:00.900
 on your eyes, that is very good for the visual system.

53:00.900 --> 53:02.960
 And it's very good for the mood systems

53:02.960 --> 53:05.080
 and the neuromodulator systems of the brain and body

53:05.080 --> 53:06.280
 that regulate mood.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.200
 This is well-established.

53:08.200 --> 53:10.280
 So I'm not telling people to get away

53:10.280 --> 53:11.400
 from their phone and their computers.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.640
 I spend a lot of time staring at a page,

53:13.640 --> 53:16.520
 drawing, writing, texting, et cetera, just like you do.

53:16.520 --> 53:20.040
 But we're really talking about some very simple protocols

53:20.040 --> 53:22.200
 that aren't just designed to improve your sleep,

53:22.200 --> 53:26.200
 but are really designed to bolster and enhance your vision.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.960
 And of course, because it's this podcast,

53:27.960 --> 53:30.120
 we will also talk about things that you can take

53:30.120 --> 53:31.000
 to improve your vision.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.120
 But if your visual behavior isn't right,

53:35.120 --> 53:37.320
 and I do believe we should always start with behaviors

53:37.320 --> 53:39.880
 and then think about nutrition, supplementation, et cetera.

53:39.880 --> 53:42.120
 If your behaviors around vision aren't right,

53:42.120 --> 53:45.240
 you cannot expect to have good, healthy eyesight

53:45.240 --> 53:48.560
 for a long time, meaning throughout your lifespan.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.360
 And if your vision is already poor,

53:50.360 --> 53:52.820
 many of these things that I'm talking about today,

53:52.820 --> 53:54.840
 perhaps all of them, will improve your vision

53:54.840 --> 53:56.480
 to some degree.

53:56.480 --> 53:59.040
 And if your vision is starting to go,

53:59.040 --> 54:01.400
 then doing these behaviors is likely

54:01.400 --> 54:03.920
 to really enhance the quality of the vision

54:03.920 --> 54:06.600
 that you will build and maintain over time.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.780
 And all of these are essentially zero cost, okay?

54:09.780 --> 54:11.740
 If you live in a very dark environment,

54:11.740 --> 54:14.740
 like a cave or outer space,

54:14.740 --> 54:16.520
 it's going to be hard to do some of this stuff.

54:16.520 --> 54:20.560
 But if you're on planet earth, even if there's cloud cover,

54:20.560 --> 54:22.960
 chances are you can do some or most,

54:22.960 --> 54:26.060
 or even all of these, some, most, or all days.

54:26.060 --> 54:29.280
 What I'm about to describe next is going to seem so silly

54:29.280 --> 54:32.080
 on the face of it, but has deep mechanism to support it.

54:32.080 --> 54:37.080
 Put simply, when you get tired, your eyelids close.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.300
 And when you're alert, your eyelids are open.

54:42.400 --> 54:46.440
 That is because you have neurons in your brain

54:46.440 --> 54:49.080
 that depending on your level of alertness

54:49.080 --> 54:52.160
 will make it easy or hard to keep your eyes open.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.200
 Now that's a complete duh,

54:55.200 --> 54:57.300
 except that we don't often think about the relationship

54:57.300 --> 55:02.300
 between alertness and where we are looking and our eyelids.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.240
 Now, I learned this from a colleague of mine in psychiatry

55:05.240 --> 55:06.480
 who happens to work on hypnosis.

55:06.480 --> 55:07.920
 I'm not going to hypnotize you right now.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.320
 That's actually for a future episode.

55:10.320 --> 55:14.520
 But what happens when we get tired?

55:14.520 --> 55:17.140
 Our eyelids close and our chin moves down.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.060
 We tend to nod out this way.

55:20.060 --> 55:22.880
 If you have ever been in a classroom,

55:22.880 --> 55:24.040
 certainly not one of mine,

55:24.040 --> 55:25.920
 but if you've been in a classroom

55:25.920 --> 55:29.680
 and the lecture is kind of drawing on or it's the afternoon,

55:29.680 --> 55:31.200
 what you'll notice is that a number of students,

55:31.200 --> 55:34.180
 their heads are kind of,

55:34.180 --> 55:36.480
 their eyelids are closing and their chin is dropping.

55:36.480 --> 55:39.160
 And then you'll see a bunch of heads balancing back up.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.560
 I was definitely one of those people in class.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.660
 If it was post-lunch in the afternoon, it's warm,

55:44.660 --> 55:47.400
 the hum of the air conditioner or whatever it is,

55:47.400 --> 55:49.220
 and I just out, okay?

55:50.500 --> 55:53.320
 When we're wide awake, the opposite happens.

55:53.320 --> 55:56.440
 Our eyelids are open all the way

55:56.440 --> 55:58.360
 and our chin happens to be up.

55:58.360 --> 56:01.280
 And no, this is not me telling you to have good posture.

56:01.280 --> 56:04.720
 However, what I learned from my colleague at Stanford

56:04.720 --> 56:08.560
 is that these circuits actually act in loops.

56:08.560 --> 56:10.880
 When we look up,

56:10.880 --> 56:13.640
 maybe it's because these melanopsin cells

56:13.640 --> 56:15.660
 are in the bottom of our retina, they are.

56:15.660 --> 56:17.240
 And maybe it's because they're there

56:17.240 --> 56:21.720
 in order to view sunlight, which is overhead, which it is.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.360
 But that system of alertness

56:24.360 --> 56:26.560
 is linked to the position of our eyes.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.520
 So when we look up and our eyelids are up,

56:28.520 --> 56:31.520
 it actually has a purpose.

56:31.520 --> 56:35.760
 It actually creates a wakefulness signal for the brain.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.900
 And so while this might seem like the silliest

56:37.900 --> 56:41.280
 and simple tool that I might ever describe on this podcast,

56:41.280 --> 56:44.040
 if you are feeling tired,

56:44.040 --> 56:45.840
 it actually can be beneficial

56:45.840 --> 56:47.520
 to the wakefulness systems of the brain,

56:47.520 --> 56:48.880
 including the locus coeruleus

56:48.880 --> 56:51.020
 and these areas that release norepinephrine,

56:51.020 --> 56:54.600
 to actually look up, to actually look up toward the ceiling.

56:54.600 --> 56:56.360
 You don't want your chin all the way back,

56:56.360 --> 56:59.480
 but to look up and to raise your eyes toward the ceiling

56:59.480 --> 57:02.920
 and to look up and try and hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.760
 So this isn't looking up and closing your eyes

57:04.760 --> 57:07.120
 like on a nice sunny day, that's relaxing.

57:07.120 --> 57:11.120
 This is looking up and actually looking up at the ceiling.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.680
 It actually triggers some of the areas of the brain

57:13.680 --> 57:15.400
 that are involved in wakefulness.

57:15.400 --> 57:18.220
 So if you're somebody who's falling asleep at your work,

57:18.220 --> 57:20.220
 this can be very beneficial.

57:20.220 --> 57:25.220
 Likewise, many people are looking at their phone all day

57:26.720 --> 57:28.360
 and their chin is down,

57:28.360 --> 57:29.860
 and then they're sitting at a computer

57:29.860 --> 57:31.000
 that's positioned below them

57:31.000 --> 57:33.960
 and they're having trouble staying awake or focusing.

57:33.960 --> 57:34.840
 It can be very bad.

57:34.840 --> 57:36.120
 I tell Costello this all the time

57:36.120 --> 57:37.160
 because he's always falling asleep

57:37.160 --> 57:38.380
 while he's trying to do his work.

57:38.380 --> 57:42.880
 Positioning your computer screen up at eye level

57:42.880 --> 57:46.360
 or sometimes having it actually above eye level

57:46.360 --> 57:49.120
 can actually create wakefulness and alertness

57:49.120 --> 57:50.400
 for the work that you're going to do.

57:50.400 --> 57:53.220
 This is simply because of this connection

57:53.220 --> 57:55.920
 between the brainstem circuits and the other neural circuits

57:55.920 --> 58:00.920
 that control wakefulness and eyelids opening and looking up.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.480
 Okay, so again, it's remarkably simple,

58:04.480 --> 58:05.680
 almost laughably simple,

58:05.680 --> 58:08.600
 but it's grounded in some of the most hardwired,

58:08.600 --> 58:12.160
 meaning present from birth aspects of our neural circuitry.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.480
 And norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus

58:15.480 --> 58:16.960
 isn't just a mouthful.

58:16.960 --> 58:20.960
 It's a really interesting and powerful mechanism

58:20.960 --> 58:22.600
 for how the rest of the brain wakes up.

58:22.600 --> 58:25.240
 Locus coeruleus hoses the rest of your brain

58:25.240 --> 58:28.980
 with norepinephrine in order to wake up those circuits

58:28.980 --> 58:30.200
 for work and attention.

58:30.200 --> 58:34.200
 And so eyes up is actually a way,

58:34.200 --> 58:36.560
 a route into increased alertness.

58:36.560 --> 58:39.480
 Eyes down is a route into sleepiness,

58:39.480 --> 58:41.520
 into reduced alertness.

58:41.520 --> 58:45.320
 And I have only one friend that texts up here,

58:45.320 --> 58:47.480
 like on the street, holds his phone up here.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.000
 It looks ridiculous.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.960
 And yet, you know, if we were trying to create

58:52.960 --> 58:55.300
 more sense of alertness, if that's your goal,

58:55.300 --> 58:58.520
 positioning computer screens up high, chin up,

58:58.520 --> 59:00.400
 looking up if you need to kind of create

59:00.400 --> 59:03.000
 an alertness signal, not always being chinned down

59:03.000 --> 59:06.760
 and texting or working into typewriters or reading below us

59:06.760 --> 59:10.400
 is actually going to send a recurring wakefulness signal.

59:10.400 --> 59:11.840
 When things are up, we tend to be alert.

59:11.840 --> 59:14.160
 When everything's focused down, including our eyes,

59:14.160 --> 59:16.880
 it tends to have a more suppressive or sedative type

59:16.880 --> 59:19.120
 signaling to the deeper centers of the brain.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.120
 Now, before we move on to the science and tools

59:22.120 --> 59:24.660
 and protocols related to pattern vision,

59:24.660 --> 59:26.800
 I want to mention another study that was done

59:26.800 --> 59:28.420
 by the University of Pennsylvania.

59:28.420 --> 59:31.680
 They have a terrific group there that works on sleep

59:31.680 --> 59:33.380
 that made an important discovery

59:33.380 --> 59:35.760
 that I think everybody should know about,

59:35.760 --> 59:39.920
 which is that children that sleep in rooms

59:39.920 --> 59:43.480
 that have a nightlight or dim lights

59:43.480 --> 59:47.540
 are much more likely to develop myopia, nearsightedness.

59:48.800 --> 59:53.080
 Conversely, children that sleep in very dark rooms,

59:53.080 --> 59:57.600
 so either very dim nightlights or a complete black,

59:58.480 --> 1:00:01.420
 they have a much lower, statistically speaking,

1:00:01.420 --> 1:00:03.160
 a significantly lower probability

1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:06.120
 of developing myopia, nearsightedness.

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:07.960
 Now, why is that?

1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:12.400
 It's because the wavelengths of light that matter

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:14.120
 for these melanopsin cells

1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:17.600
 oftentimes can get through the eyelids.

1:00:18.620 --> 1:00:21.840
 And that's particularly true for children

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:23.760
 and people that have thin eyelids.

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.360
 Some people, like me, have very thin eyelids.

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:27.940
 I've been told this before.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:30.140
 Not many people touch my eyelids,

1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:33.520
 but among those that have, they have very thin eyelids.

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:36.780
 I notice I have very thin eyelids compared to, say, Costello.

1:00:36.780 --> 1:00:38.200
 Now, Costello's eyes droop.

1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:39.580
 He can't even close his eyes all the way.

1:00:39.580 --> 1:00:40.620
 They're so droopy.

1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:43.600
 But many people have thin eyelids,

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.680
 and those people are going to be even more prone

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.240
 to light coming in through the eyelid.

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:52.540
 So for parents, for kids, and for adults,

1:00:52.540 --> 1:00:54.940
 you really want to try to get to a place

1:00:54.940 --> 1:00:57.380
 where you can sleep in a completely black

1:00:57.380 --> 1:00:58.940
 or dark environment.

1:00:58.940 --> 1:01:00.880
 One little exposure to light, no big deal.

1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:03.600
 But this ties back to the other protocol

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:06.420
 that I've described before in the mood and sleep episodes,

1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:10.260
 which is that viewing light, even a very low intensity,

1:01:10.260 --> 1:01:12.400
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:14.440
 it's extremely detrimental to the dopamine

1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:17.140
 and other mood-producing systems of the brain.

1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:19.720
 It can negatively impact learning and immunity

1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:23.360
 and even blood sugar and make people type 2 diabetes prone

1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:26.120
 by way of communication from these melanopsin cells

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:28.660
 to a structure in the brain called the habenula.

1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:30.500
 Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:32.400
 Well, because people have asked for more mechanisms.

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:35.200
 So if you really want to know when you look at blue light

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.980
 or if blue light is getting in through your eyelids

1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:38.280
 in the middle of the night,

1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:42.940
 it is likely distorting these lens accommodation mechanism

1:01:42.940 --> 1:01:47.220
 in the eye and leading to myopia in some cases.

1:01:47.220 --> 1:01:49.620
 So that's one reason to avoid blue light exposure

1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:50.460
 and bright light exposure,

1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:52.700
 even nightlight exposure in the middle of the night.

1:01:52.700 --> 1:01:55.300
 Viewing any light of bright intensity

1:01:55.300 --> 1:01:58.000
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000
 on a consistent basis is going to suppress dopamine

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.200
 because of the way that that light activates

1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:04.980
 these melanopsin cells and the habenula

1:02:04.980 --> 1:02:06.740
 and the dopamine system.

1:02:06.740 --> 1:02:08.660
 So it's all very simple.

1:02:08.660 --> 1:02:12.260
 Get as much bright light as you can safely, right?

1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:13.760
 You never want to look at any light so bright

1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:16.720
 that it's painful to look at during the daytime.

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:18.920
 Try and go without sunglasses unless you need them.

1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:21.080
 Now I wear sunglasses for sake of sport

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:23.140
 and sake of when it's really bright out,

1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:26.200
 but I try to get two hours a day of working outside

1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:28.820
 or being outside, even if there's cloud cover,

1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:30.700
 that's going to offset myopia.

1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:32.280
 It's going to help you get better sleep.

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:35.280
 It's going to support mood and metabolism, et cetera.

1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:38.140
 And at night, if you're sleeping with a lot of lights

1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:40.380
 in the room, and especially if there are kids

1:02:40.380 --> 1:02:41.420
 that need a nightlight,

1:02:41.420 --> 1:02:43.860
 you should try and wean them off that nightlight

1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:46.020
 because it's going to be beneficial for their vision

1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:47.260
 to wean them off that nightlight

1:02:47.260 --> 1:02:49.220
 and put them into a darker environment.

1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:50.840
 Obviously you want to get them emotionally comfortable

1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:52.440
 with that first.

1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:54.160
 Now let's talk about pattern vision,

1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:58.000
 actual seeing things like faces and colors, et cetera.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:01.240
 I'm presuming that some of you out there are colorblind.

1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:05.240
 We can all help the red-green colorblind folks out there.

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:09.360
 By not using red in slides and diagrams and on menus

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:12.000
 and things of that sort, try and use magenta instead.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.440
 They can see the contrast between magenta and green better

1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:18.960
 than if there's red and green.

1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:21.120
 So be kind to the colorblind folks out there.

1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:23.040
 It's actually a fair percentage.

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.360
 And there are a lot of different kinds of colorblind.

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:28.280
 I should just mention some people are true monochromats.

1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:29.660
 They see the world in black and white.

1:03:29.660 --> 1:03:31.200
 That's exceedingly rare.

1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:35.120
 Most colorblind people, colorblind in quotes,

1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:36.880
 are red-green colorblind,

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.640
 meaning they lack red cone photopigment,

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:42.100
 meaning they can't see long wavelengths of light.

1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:45.520
 So they see the world much as a canine or a cat does

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:48.160
 where they don't get the green-red contrast.

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:50.500
 That's where we call it red-green colorblind.

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:51.960
 They have the green cones,

1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:54.000
 but they can't do the contrast comparison

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.680
 that I described at the beginning of the episode.

1:03:56.680 --> 1:04:00.420
 So use magenta and they will be able to see things.

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:02.400
 You wonder why stop signs and stop lights

1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:03.880
 and things aren't in magenta.

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:05.360
 Well, because the world is unkind

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.760
 to the red-green colorblind individuals

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:09.080
 and they have to learn the position

1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:11.360
 of those lights in the street lights

1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:13.400
 and they have to learn the shapes of signs,

1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:14.320
 which they can do readily

1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:16.700
 and it usually says stop on it as well.

1:04:16.700 --> 1:04:19.600
 But if you care about colorblind folks, which I do,

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:21.960
 then we could all do them a service by,

1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:24.600
 I think by law actually in the US,

1:04:24.600 --> 1:04:27.320
 menus are required to be colorblind accessible.

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:31.480
 How can you improve your vision?

1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.980
 How can you get better at seeing things?

1:04:33.980 --> 1:04:36.780
 Well, one way is to make sure that you spend

1:04:36.780 --> 1:04:39.360
 at least 10 minutes a day total,

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:42.280
 at least, viewing things off in the distance.

1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:45.360
 So that would be well over half a mile or more.

1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:46.720
 Try and see a horizon,

1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:50.080
 try and get your vision out to a location

1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:53.000
 that's beyond the four walls of your house or apartment

1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:56.660
 or the doors of your car and the windshield of your car.

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:59.360
 I know that can be hard to do, but it's very valuable.

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:00.940
 If you live in a city like New York

1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:02.820
 and it's skyscrapers everywhere,

1:05:02.820 --> 1:05:04.080
 you've probably experienced

1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:06.680
 the incredible sense of relaxation.

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:08.080
 And it's aesthetically beautiful

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:10.240
 when you are walking down one of these long avenues

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.560
 and you turn,

1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:14.080
 and I think they have a name for this in New York,

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:17.560
 where the sunset is suddenly visible

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:20.320
 along a long avenue between some skyscrapers.

1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:21.800
 And it's just very relaxing

1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:23.720
 to be able suddenly to see at a distance.

1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:25.960
 And that's actually because this eye mechanism

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:30.840
 relaxing the lens and relaxing some of the musculature

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:34.040
 around the eyes send signals deep into the brainstem

1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:35.420
 that release some of the centers

1:05:35.420 --> 1:05:39.040
 that are involved in alertness, AKA stress.

1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:40.880
 And it's very pleasant for a reason.

1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:45.240
 It's not a placebo effect, if you will.

1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:46.520
 There are a bunch of neurochemicals

1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:48.300
 and things that are associated with that.

1:05:48.300 --> 1:05:49.820
 So try and see at a distance

1:05:49.820 --> 1:05:51.380
 because it's good for your eyesight.

1:05:51.380 --> 1:05:54.020
 It'll keep this lens nice and elastic

1:05:54.020 --> 1:05:55.560
 and the muscles nice and strong

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:56.660
 that move the lens.

1:05:56.660 --> 1:06:00.480
 And it has this relaxing component to it.

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:05.200
 Now, our visual system is exquisitely tuned to motion,

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:07.080
 not just our self-generated motion,

1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:08.840
 but the motion of things around us.

1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:11.000
 And one of the things that it does

1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.740
 is something called smooth pursuit.

1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:16.360
 Smooth pursuit is our ability

1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:19.320
 to track individual objects moving,

1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:20.160
 as the name suggests,

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:23.960
 smoothly through space in various trajectories.

1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:28.960
 You can actually train or improve your vision

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.000
 by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.000
 And that sounds really boring.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:34.840
 What you can do is,

1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:37.080
 and I'll provide a link to some that I think are pretty good

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.420
 that are used in various clinics,

1:06:39.420 --> 1:06:42.360
 ophthalmology and optometry clinics.

1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:45.000
 You can actually take a few minutes each day,

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.640
 or maybe if you don't do it each day,

1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:47.880
 you could do every third day or so,

1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:50.440
 and actually just visually track a ball.

1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:52.580
 Sometimes it's moving in and kind of an infinity symbol.

1:06:52.580 --> 1:06:54.880
 Sometimes it's more of a sawtooth.

1:06:54.880 --> 1:06:56.680
 Sometimes it's changing speed.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:59.780
 Sometimes the cue that you're following,

1:06:59.780 --> 1:07:03.360
 the little target, is dilating and contracting.

1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:05.920
 This is going to keep the muscles,

1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:06.760
 I want to be clear,

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:09.420
 this is going to keep the extraocular muscles

1:07:09.420 --> 1:07:11.200
 conditioned and strong

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:15.460
 and allow you to have a healthy smooth pursuit system.

1:07:15.460 --> 1:07:17.520
 Remember, the brain follows the eye.

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:19.680
 It follows the movements of the eye.

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:20.840
 It has to deal with that.

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:23.720
 And the neural circuits within the brain have to cope

1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:25.560
 with changes in smooth pursuit.

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.560
 So if you're doing a lot of reading up close,

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:28.680
 you're not viewing horizons,

1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:31.720
 you're not getting a lot of smooth pursuit type stimulation

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:32.900
 from your life,

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:35.920
 or you're just getting it within the confines

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:37.320
 of a little box on your phone,

1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:40.540
 like your smooth pursuit is over millimeters

1:07:40.540 --> 1:07:43.060
 or what we always talk in terms of visual angle,

1:07:43.060 --> 1:07:44.880
 but the amount of degrees of visual angle.

1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:46.320
 But if you're just looking at smooth pursuit

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.020
 in this little tiny box on your phone

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:49.360
 or on your computer screen,

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:51.420
 and you're not looking at objects in your environment,

1:07:51.420 --> 1:07:52.940
 like swooping birds and things like that,

1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:53.920
 which I'm guessing many of you

1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:55.560
 are not spending your time doing,

1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:57.360
 well, these mechanisms for smooth pursuit

1:07:57.360 --> 1:07:58.420
 will get worse over time.

1:07:58.420 --> 1:07:59.560
 Your vision will get worse.

1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:02.160
 And so while I prefer that people get out

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:04.080
 into the real world and experience

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:07.040
 smooth pursuit tracking of visual objects,

1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:08.800
 and maybe it's a good reason to go to a hockey game

1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:11.080
 or try and keep your eye on the puck,

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:13.880
 which I can never seem to do, move so fast,

1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:16.520
 or I guess this is a good reason to watch live sports

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:17.620
 if that's your thing,

1:08:17.620 --> 1:08:19.880
 or watch a tennis match like a cat, like a kitten,

1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:21.940
 watching the ball go back and forth.

1:08:21.940 --> 1:08:25.040
 Whatever, watching kids play, it doesn't really matter.

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:29.960
 The idea is that you want to use the visual system regularly

1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:31.000
 for what it was designed for,

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.440
 and smooth pursuit is a great way

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:36.440
 to keep the visual and motion tracking systems

1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:38.820
 of the brain and the eye and the extraocular muscles

1:08:38.820 --> 1:08:41.120
 working in a really nice coordinate fashion.

1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:46.120
 I would say five to 10 minutes, three times a week,

1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:47.940
 will be great if you care about your vision,

1:08:47.940 --> 1:08:50.180
 you can train your vision in this way.

1:08:50.180 --> 1:08:53.540
 The other one is to train accommodation.

1:08:53.540 --> 1:08:55.180
 There are a lot of videos out there,

1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:57.000
 I want to be clear, on the internet,

1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.320
 some of which are from clinicians, some of which are not,

1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:02.600
 some of which are from scientists,

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:04.580
 some of which are from other sources,

1:09:04.580 --> 1:09:08.380
 talking about things you can do to make your vision better,

1:09:08.380 --> 1:09:09.560
 to improve your vision.

1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:12.700
 Most of those are geared toward improving

1:09:12.700 --> 1:09:14.440
 the extraocular eye muscles,

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:18.120
 but I did consult with our chair of ophthalmology

1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:20.960
 at Stanford School of Medicine, Jeff Goldberg,

1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:23.780
 who's an MD and a PhD, a phenomenal scientist

1:09:23.780 --> 1:09:25.600
 and a phenomenal clinician,

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:28.360
 and incidentally, a phenomenal chairman as well,

1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:31.120
 about what sorts of things,

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:35.200
 tools are actually beneficial for pattern vision and sight,

1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:37.440
 because there's just so much out there on the internet,

1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:40.960
 not all of which is accurate or good, frankly.

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:43.940
 And he agreed that a smooth pursuit stimulus,

1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:47.920
 that kind of training, as well as, or exercise,

1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:49.720
 as well as near far.

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:51.280
 So spending a few minutes,

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:52.840
 you might even just do this for two minutes

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:54.920
 of looking at something up close,

1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:57.160
 that's going to activate these accommodation mechanisms

1:09:57.160 --> 1:09:59.240
 and then moving it at arm's length

1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:01.360
 and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds,

1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:03.840
 maybe more, maybe 15 or 20 seconds,

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:07.480
 then slowly moving it into a location and then out.

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.700
 This is actually a lot like the visual training

1:10:09.700 --> 1:10:13.740
 that's done post-concussion to try and repair

1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:16.300
 actually repair some of the balance and motor

1:10:16.300 --> 1:10:20.360
 and visual and cognitive aspects of the brain.

1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:23.520
 And we are going to have a guest on in a future time

1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:26.560
 to deal with concussion and some post-concussion training.

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:28.720
 A lot of post-concussion recovery and training

1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.360
 centers around the visual system,

1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:33.800
 not just because people are trying to recover their vision

1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:35.560
 and their sense of balance,

1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:37.300
 but because, as I mentioned earlier,

1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:40.480
 the brain's ability to make sense of its environment

1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:42.840
 and the brain's ability to parse time,

1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:44.800
 not just on the day-night schedule,

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:49.200
 but also shorter time intervals follows the visual system.

1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:51.140
 Something we'll turn to a little bit more at the end.

1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:52.080
 So what does this mean?

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:56.840
 The tool is spend two to three minutes doing smooth pursuit.

1:10:56.840 --> 1:10:59.000
 There's some programs on YouTube.

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.840
 You can just look up smooth pursuit stimulus

1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:04.220
 and I'll provide a link to a couple I like as well.

1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:06.600
 You could do this with a pen if you wanted.

1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:09.160
 You could do this, someone else could hold a wand

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:10.000
 and you could do that

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.540
 if you've got someone that can do that for you.

1:11:11.540 --> 1:11:13.260
 Practice accommodation for a few minutes,

1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:16.360
 maybe every other day, just bringing something in close.

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:18.240
 You'll feel the strain of your eyes doing that.

1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:19.540
 I can feel it right now.

1:11:19.540 --> 1:11:20.980
 Move it out.

1:11:20.980 --> 1:11:22.520
 You'll feel a relaxation point.

1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:24.200
 Move it past that relaxation point

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:25.920
 where you will have to do what's called a virgin side

1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:27.840
 movement to maintain focus on that location

1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:30.080
 as it moves out, bring it back in.

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:32.720
 At the point where you actually have to go cross-eyed,

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:33.940
 this will differ for different people

1:11:33.940 --> 1:11:35.840
 depending on how far apart your eyes are,

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:37.540
 so-called interpupillary distance.

1:11:37.540 --> 1:11:39.280
 So for me, I have been teased before,

1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:41.480
 I have a very short interpupillary distance.

1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:44.300
 I'm not a cyclops, but I'm heading there.

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:47.040
 Some people are more wall-eyed like a flounder.

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.820
 Well, depending on your interpupillary distance,

1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:51.860
 the point at which things get blurry

1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:53.880
 and cross-eyed will vary.

1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:57.440
 But for me, as I get about, oh gosh,

1:11:57.440 --> 1:11:59.340
 I guess it's about six inches from my nose,

1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:01.440
 it's really hard, I can't accommodate any longer.

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:04.000
 I move it out another inch and everything's in nice focus.

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.920
 Try and see whether or not you can get things closer.

1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:07.280
 Now you don't want to get cross-eyed.

1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.000
 Remember what your parents told you,

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.240
 or my parents told me that if you cross your eyes

1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:13.520
 when you're young, that they can stay that way.

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:16.040
 Actually, they won't necessarily stay that way,

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:18.940
 but your brain can start losing information

1:12:18.940 --> 1:12:21.840
 and the ability to see binocular depth,

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:22.960
 something we'll talk about in a moment.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:26.560
 But for now, the protocol would be two to three,

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.400
 maybe five minutes, just practice that,

1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:29.400
 practice accommodation,

1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:31.880
 and then be sure to give your eyes some rest.

1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:34.500
 Get outside, look at a horizon or do nothing,

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.280
 just kind of let your eyes go soft.

1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:38.120
 I guess what the yogis would call soft gaze,

1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:39.760
 just kind of relax your eyelids,

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:43.020
 not this, not eyes closed, just relax.

1:12:43.020 --> 1:12:45.040
 Panoramic vision, try and see the walls around you

1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:46.920
 without moving your head.

1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:48.280
 Exercise your eye muscles,

1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:50.940
 exercise the accommodation mechanisms of your eyes.

1:12:50.940 --> 1:12:53.160
 Practice a little bit of smooth pursuit.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:54.580
 You don't have to be neurotic about this,

1:12:54.580 --> 1:12:56.240
 but if you do this often enough,

1:12:57.120 --> 1:12:59.660
 meaning every other day, every third day or so,

1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:01.280
 you can be the strange person on the plane

1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:03.460
 or in the classroom doing this.

1:13:03.460 --> 1:13:06.360
 People might chuckle or look at you funny or tease you,

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:08.780
 but that's okay because you'll be able to see

1:13:08.780 --> 1:13:11.040
 when they are losing their vision,

1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:13.000
 so you'll get the last laugh.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:13.920
 Please don't laugh at them,

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:15.420
 but maybe you can help them at that point.

1:13:15.420 --> 1:13:16.920
 You can hold the pen for them.

1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:19.280
 It's worth doing.

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:21.200
 It's really worth preserving your vision.

1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:23.600
 And again, if you're a young person, this is great

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:24.920
 because then you can actually build

1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:27.260
 an extra strong visual system

1:13:27.260 --> 1:13:29.600
 using all the tools that we're describing.

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:33.160
 I do want to talk about a new set of findings

1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:34.920
 that are related to red light

1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:37.960
 and offsetting age-related macular degeneration.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.940
 There are a lot of ways in which our visual system

1:13:39.940 --> 1:13:40.780
 gets worse over time,

1:13:40.780 --> 1:13:44.020
 but one is so-called age-related macular degeneration.

1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:46.160
 Glenn Jeffrey at the University College London,

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:50.280
 somebody I've known for decades because he's a scientist,

1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:52.000
 has done beautiful work on development

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.040
 and function of the visual system,

1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:55.720
 has published a number of papers recently.

1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.600
 One that got a particularly high amount of attention

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:02.520
 in the press was one that showed that flashing red light

1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:05.360
 into the eyes early in the day, not late in the day,

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:08.240
 early in the day can help offset

1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:11.180
 some age-related macular degeneration,

1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:14.120
 presumably by enhancing the mitochondrial function

1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:15.680
 in the photoreceptors.

1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:17.920
 There does seem to be some evidence for that,

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:19.480
 although it's still early days.

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:21.760
 I want to emphasize you don't want to shine

1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:23.200
 really bright lights into your eyes.

1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:25.620
 You never want to look at any light that's so bright

1:14:25.620 --> 1:14:26.860
 that it's painful,

1:14:26.860 --> 1:14:28.700
 and you never want to force your eyelids to stay open.

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:30.980
 If you need to close your eyes in order to be comfortable,

1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:33.380
 well, then chances are that light is too bright.

1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:35.540
 But doing just a couple minutes a day,

1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:38.640
 like two minutes a day of flashing this red light

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.500
 into one eye and then the other,

1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:44.440
 as long as it was early in the day before noontime,

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.080
 and as long as it was in individuals

1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:48.860
 that were 40 years or older,

1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:50.640
 did seem to have a significant effect

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.800
 in offsetting some of the age-related macular degeneration

1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:55.560
 that would otherwise occur.

1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:56.860
 Again, these are early findings.

1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:59.200
 If you want to do this, please be careful.

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:02.600
 Please talk to your optometrist and or ophthalmologist.

1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:03.680
 Your eyesight is precious.

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:06.120
 You don't want to damage it, but it is interesting,

1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:07.460
 and it does seem like red light

1:15:07.460 --> 1:15:09.280
 can improve the function of the mitochondria.

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:11.820
 These photoreceptors have a lot of mitochondria,

1:15:11.820 --> 1:15:14.520
 the energy-producing organelles within the cells,

1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:17.720
 because they are some of the most metabolically active cells

1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:18.920
 in your entire body.

1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:20.940
 Your photoreceptors are active all the time

1:15:20.940 --> 1:15:21.780
 as you're looking around,

1:15:21.780 --> 1:15:23.840
 and even when your eyes are closed, they're active.

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:26.400
 In fact, through a weird twist of the biology,

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.080
 and please look this up if you're really interested in this,

1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:32.540
 your photoreceptors are actually most active in the dark.

1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:33.380
 This is so weird.

1:15:33.380 --> 1:15:37.060
 It's a twist of biology, the way the system's arranged,

1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:40.120
 that when light comes on, they shut off their activity.

1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:42.920
 So actually, whether or not you see something in front of you

1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:44.840
 like this pen or my face

1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:48.160
 is because the way your photoreceptors are turning off,

1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:50.240
 not turning on, it's a really cool twist,

1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:53.540
 and I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole,

1:15:53.540 --> 1:15:54.560
 but check it out.

1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:56.120
 If you're interested in how photoreceptors work,

1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:59.000
 it's an absolutely incredible literature.

1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.640
 Just Google, excuse me, look up on the web.

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.000
 We are not partial just to Google.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:06.040
 I happen to use Google, but use your web browser

1:16:06.040 --> 1:16:10.280
 to look up a photoreceptors hyperpolarization site,

1:16:10.280 --> 1:16:11.480
 and you can learn a lot about that

1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:14.160
 if you're a real nerd for the stuff like I am.

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:19.160
 Okay, so red light to the eye can perhaps, it seems,

1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:22.760
 help maintain vision, doing smooth pursuit exercises,

1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:25.320
 and accommodation, near-far exercises.

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:27.860
 Some people suffer from poor eyesight

1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:29.760
 simply because their eyes get dry.

1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:31.920
 There are incredible, believe it or not,

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:34.380
 lubricating mechanisms for the eye,

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:37.200
 not just tears, but thin sheet of oil.

1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:38.040
 I mean, it's just amazing.

1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:40.000
 Unless you have some sort of corneal abrasion,

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.680
 the cornea is the clear stuff on the outside of your eye,

1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:45.960
 corneal abrasion, when you blink, it's smooth.

1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:47.200
 You don't feel it.

1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:48.660
 It's just really, really smooth,

1:16:48.660 --> 1:16:50.880
 and yet if you've ever had a corneal scratch,

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.440
 I've had this, it's really rough.

1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:54.080
 It is so painful.

1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:56.580
 You have a ton of pain receptors in the cornea.

1:16:56.580 --> 1:17:01.580
 The lubrication of the cornea is supported by blinking,

1:17:03.780 --> 1:17:06.060
 and while it seems a little silly,

1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:09.240
 some people actually benefit from doing, you know,

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:12.380
 some, you know, five or 10 or 15 seconds of blinking,

1:17:12.380 --> 1:17:15.020
 and then doing their focused work.

1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:16.460
 Some people, their eyes are drying out,

1:17:16.460 --> 1:17:19.080
 because as we focus, if we're trying to do something,

1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:22.080
 our eyelids stay open, the eyes can dry out,

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.720
 but it also can make it such

1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:25.380
 that when we blink the next time,

1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:26.900
 there's a kind of a need to focus,

1:17:26.900 --> 1:17:29.980
 because there's some distortions in these oils and liquids

1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:32.020
 across the corneal surface.

1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:33.660
 If you're somebody who suffers from dry eye,

1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:36.140
 I do hope they'll find a treatment or a cure for dry eye

1:17:36.140 --> 1:17:37.860
 soon, there isn't one at present.

1:17:37.860 --> 1:17:39.620
 Someone stands to make a lot of money out there.

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:42.060
 If you can find a cure for dry eye,

1:17:42.060 --> 1:17:44.980
 let the companies know or start a company.

1:17:44.980 --> 1:17:47.100
 Right now, it's still a mystery as to how to do that,

1:17:47.100 --> 1:17:49.060
 but blinking for five to 15 seconds,

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:51.480
 probably slowly, not as quickly as I'm doing here on video,

1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:54.340
 but just, you know, maybe a blink every second or two

1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:56.380
 for 15 seconds can lubricate the eyes,

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:59.300
 and that's not directly related to anything neural,

1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:01.580
 it's just going to allow the optics of your eye to be clear,

1:18:01.580 --> 1:18:03.940
 just like when the screen of your phone gets dirty,

1:18:03.940 --> 1:18:05.620
 like when Costello is texting on my phone

1:18:05.620 --> 1:18:07.700
 and I pick it up and it's like covered with smudge,

1:18:07.700 --> 1:18:09.580
 to clean it off in order to see things clearly,

1:18:09.580 --> 1:18:12.060
 the same thing is happening for these optical devices

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:14.100
 on the front of your brain.

1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:15.980
 Remember, these are brain.

1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:19.780
 Okay, so a lot of protocols today, almost all of them.

1:18:21.380 --> 1:18:22.620
 Behavioral protocols.

1:18:22.620 --> 1:18:26.100
 I do want to talk a little bit more about vision

1:18:26.100 --> 1:18:27.620
 and how it works internally,

1:18:27.620 --> 1:18:29.380
 and then I also want to talk about

1:18:29.380 --> 1:18:31.220
 some of the foods and supplements

1:18:31.220 --> 1:18:32.880
 that have been shown to support vision

1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:34.400
 and offset visual loss,

1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:36.940
 and maybe even reverse some visual loss.

1:18:36.940 --> 1:18:40.100
 Let's talk about binocular vision and lazy eye.

1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:44.580
 I'm very familiar with lazy eye because when I was a kid,

1:18:44.580 --> 1:18:47.620
 I went swimming one day, one day,

1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:49.300
 and I didn't have my goggles,

1:18:49.300 --> 1:18:52.320
 and so something must have been happening, as I recall,

1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:54.900
 with the eye moving down through the water.

1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:55.980
 I've always had this problem

1:18:55.980 --> 1:18:58.580
 that I can only do the freestyle stroke off to one side.

1:18:58.580 --> 1:19:00.260
 The people I swim with are always laughing.

1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:02.380
 Somehow I kind of move toward drowning

1:19:02.380 --> 1:19:04.300
 when I try and breathe on the right side.

1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:07.420
 I think there's some asymmetry in the way I'm organized.

1:19:07.420 --> 1:19:09.780
 Anyway, I was off to my left

1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:12.240
 and my eye kept going in and out of the water,

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:13.400
 and there was chlorine in the water,

1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:14.460
 and it was making my eye uncomfortable,

1:19:14.460 --> 1:19:15.560
 so I just closed my eye.

1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:16.780
 I just decided, you know,

1:19:16.780 --> 1:19:19.820
 I knew more or less how to swim straight-ish.

1:19:19.820 --> 1:19:21.640
 Might've bounced off the lane lines a few times,

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:22.640
 but I just used the other eye

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:25.100
 to kind of steer for that mark on the wall.

1:19:25.100 --> 1:19:28.780
 Got out of the pool, took a shower, dried off,

1:19:28.780 --> 1:19:32.540
 and then completely lost binocular vision for three days.

1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:33.380
 Completely.

1:19:34.220 --> 1:19:37.100
 The young brain up until about age seven,

1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:40.260
 but maybe even extending out until about age 12,

1:19:40.260 --> 1:19:44.220
 is extremely vulnerable to differences

1:19:44.220 --> 1:19:46.860
 in ocular input between the two eyes.

1:19:46.860 --> 1:19:49.500
 My scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:51.620
 for discovering so-called critical periods.

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:53.960
 Periods of time in which the brain is more plastic,

1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:55.500
 more able to change.

1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:57.900
 Those two guys, David Hubel and Torrance Wiesel,

1:19:57.900 --> 1:19:59.100
 thank you, David and Torrance,

1:19:59.100 --> 1:20:01.500
 forever changed the face of visual neuroscience

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:05.220
 and forever changed the way we think about treatment

1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:06.740
 of the young brain.

1:20:06.740 --> 1:20:08.880
 It used to be thought that you wouldn't want to do a surgery

1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:12.100
 on a young kid because of risk of anesthesia

1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:13.860
 in young individuals,

1:20:13.860 --> 1:20:16.980
 but we now know that you need to repair these imbalances

1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:20.060
 that even a few hours, okay, I don't want to scare anybody.

1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:22.220
 I'll talk about reversal, but a few hours

1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:26.740
 of occluding one eye early in life can lead to permanent,

1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:28.580
 unless something's done, permanent changes

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:31.300
 in the way that the brain perceives the outside world,

1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:33.820
 such that when that eye is opened up again,

1:20:33.820 --> 1:20:35.420
 the brain actually can't make sense

1:20:35.420 --> 1:20:36.380
 of anything that's coming through it.

1:20:36.380 --> 1:20:38.580
 It shuts down that visual pathway somehow.

1:20:38.580 --> 1:20:42.340
 So what happened to me was I actually was, my eye was fine.

1:20:42.340 --> 1:20:43.820
 I got out of the pool, I opened my eye,

1:20:43.820 --> 1:20:45.420
 but I couldn't see through that eye.

1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:47.380
 Everything was blurry, double vision,

1:20:47.380 --> 1:20:48.740
 unless I covered this eye

1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:50.780
 and then I could see perfectly fine.

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:53.200
 Fortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist

1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:55.220
 who understood the literature.

1:20:55.220 --> 1:20:59.640
 Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, who understood the literature

1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:03.460
 and made it clear that what I needed to do

1:21:03.460 --> 1:21:05.660
 was to occlude the other eye,

1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:07.460
 the eye that was working very well.

1:21:07.460 --> 1:21:09.340
 Clearly he understood the work of Hubel and Wiesel.

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:11.180
 Now, again, you don't want to start playing games

1:21:11.180 --> 1:21:12.500
 with this kind of stuff when you're a kid.

1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:14.820
 If you wear, let's say you have a Halloween costume

1:21:14.820 --> 1:21:15.940
 and you wear an eye patch,

1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:17.980
 you're a pirate or something for Halloween

1:21:17.980 --> 1:21:19.840
 and you cover it up on one side,

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:21.660
 probably for the night of Halloween, it's okay.

1:21:21.660 --> 1:21:25.100
 I do not recommend doing that recreationally

1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:27.180
 if you don't need that if you're a young child

1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:28.140
 or for your child to do that,

1:21:28.140 --> 1:21:32.420
 because indeed you create imbalances in the brain machinery

1:21:32.420 --> 1:21:34.880
 that compares information coming in through the two eyes

1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:37.980
 and it can shut down the neural information

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:40.420
 for the occluded, the closed eye.

1:21:40.420 --> 1:21:42.220
 Now, I was able to reverse this issue,

1:21:42.220 --> 1:21:44.220
 but my binocular vision has never been terrific.

1:21:44.220 --> 1:21:47.020
 I'm much better at the dartboard and still not very good.

1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:49.380
 If I close one eye, I'm much better at the pool table.

1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:52.280
 If I close one eye and I still am terrible.

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:55.880
 I was the kid in the outfield,

1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:57.500
 the ball's coming towards me, the ball's coming towards me,

1:21:57.500 --> 1:21:58.320
 I'm going to catch the ball

1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:00.500
 and like a hit me square in the lip.

1:22:00.500 --> 1:22:02.980
 My binocular vision isn't great

1:22:02.980 --> 1:22:05.740
 as a consequence of this early event.

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:09.920
 And I have a hard time with those binocular stereograms,

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:11.140
 those images that are kind of,

1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:12.200
 you're supposed to look at them

1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:15.460
 and then the binocular depth image like pops out.

1:22:15.460 --> 1:22:17.780
 All the other kids were going, oh, there's the whatever,

1:22:17.780 --> 1:22:19.300
 the Statue of Liberty, there's the American,

1:22:19.300 --> 1:22:21.340
 I see dots, okay?

1:22:21.340 --> 1:22:24.580
 So I have binocular vision, but I use other cues.

1:22:24.580 --> 1:22:27.400
 I use the near far cues that I talked about before,

1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:29.700
 motion parallax, the fact that things are closer to me

1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:32.000
 or moving faster than things further away

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.740
 in order to judge depth.

1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:35.520
 And years later when I got involved in,

1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:37.620
 and I don't suggest this for most people,

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:40.800
 I got involved in boxing and martial arts

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:42.340
 when I was younger.

1:22:42.340 --> 1:22:43.440
 Sometimes we'll see fighters,

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:46.060
 this is a slip to avoid getting punched.

1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:48.140
 It's also generating motion parallax.

1:22:48.140 --> 1:22:52.660
 Many animals judge depth by moving their head,

1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:56.380
 not by using other mechanisms of accommodation, okay?

1:22:56.380 --> 1:22:59.180
 So a lot of birds and monkeys and animals

1:22:59.180 --> 1:23:02.580
 will judge depth by moving their head like this,

1:23:02.580 --> 1:23:04.540
 or they'll move from side to side.

1:23:04.540 --> 1:23:06.420
 Animals that will undulate sometimes

1:23:06.420 --> 1:23:08.340
 are actually doing a depth measurement

1:23:08.340 --> 1:23:10.060
 because as you move from side to side,

1:23:10.060 --> 1:23:12.500
 the brain is able to do the math of depth.

1:23:12.500 --> 1:23:14.340
 So what does this all mean in terms of protocols?

1:23:14.340 --> 1:23:15.280
 If you're a young person,

1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:18.540
 do your best to get really good binocular vision,

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:20.980
 not just at level of your phone or your tablet,

1:23:20.980 --> 1:23:22.060
 but also at distance.

1:23:22.060 --> 1:23:25.660
 You will build strong binocular visual machinery

1:23:25.660 --> 1:23:28.080
 in the brain and at the level of the eyes

1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:30.060
 and the eye musculature.

1:23:30.060 --> 1:23:32.800
 Now, if you're somebody who did have an occlusion,

1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:35.140
 what's needed is to cover up the other eye

1:23:35.140 --> 1:23:37.020
 to create an imbalance so that the weak eye,

1:23:37.020 --> 1:23:38.100
 the so-called lazy eye,

1:23:38.100 --> 1:23:40.380
 this is sometimes referred to as amblyopia,

1:23:40.380 --> 1:23:42.060
 that eye has to work harder.

1:23:42.060 --> 1:23:46.180
 So for me, they patched this other eye and made this eye,

1:23:46.180 --> 1:23:47.720
 eventually I got vision through that eye back,

1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:49.100
 then they opened them both up.

1:23:49.100 --> 1:23:50.820
 Now, you might ask,

1:23:50.820 --> 1:23:53.300
 what happens if you cover both eyes early in life?

1:23:53.300 --> 1:23:54.680
 And this is where it gets interesting.

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:55.520
 You might think, well,

1:23:55.520 --> 1:23:58.860
 if covering one eye leads to poor vision for that eye

1:23:58.860 --> 1:24:00.380
 after that eye is open,

1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:03.080
 covering both eyes will probably make you blind, right?

1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:05.100
 Actually, that's not what happens.

1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:06.340
 What Hubel and Wiesel discovered

1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:09.780
 and what's been affirmed many, many more times over

1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:11.500
 in subsequent studies

1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:13.180
 is that it's competitive,

1:24:13.180 --> 1:24:14.900
 that the two eyes are competing

1:24:14.900 --> 1:24:16.460
 for real estate up in the brain.

1:24:16.460 --> 1:24:18.740
 So if you actually cover both eyes,

1:24:18.740 --> 1:24:23.060
 you actually extend the period of critical plasticity.

1:24:23.060 --> 1:24:24.660
 This is a really interesting aspect

1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:26.860
 that other people are starting to leverage now

1:24:26.860 --> 1:24:29.440
 in terms of how to reopen plasticity later in life.

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.260
 But please don't go around

1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:33.040
 with your eyes covered for too long.

1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:35.100
 There are some like retreats and stuff

1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:38.140
 where people go into caves with absolutely no vision.

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.300
 It creates hallucinations.

1:24:39.300 --> 1:24:41.440
 We'll talk about why that is in just a moment.

1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:43.100
 But here's my suggestion.

1:24:43.100 --> 1:24:45.460
 Try and get balanced visual input through the two eyes.

1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:47.780
 Almost everybody has a dominant eye.

1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:50.280
 It usually doesn't relate to your dominant hand,

1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:51.120
 although it can.

1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:53.900
 And so for me, if I cover up my right eye,

1:24:53.900 --> 1:24:56.960
 I see much less well, much more poorly.

1:24:56.960 --> 1:24:58.180
 It's a little bit fuzzy

1:24:58.180 --> 1:24:59.420
 and I have to work harder

1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:01.540
 in order to see the camera, for instance.

1:25:01.540 --> 1:25:03.220
 Then if I cover up my left eye,

1:25:03.220 --> 1:25:04.860
 it's actually really easy for me to relax.

1:25:04.860 --> 1:25:06.900
 I have a dominant eye.

1:25:06.900 --> 1:25:08.220
 Yeah, you can balance that out

1:25:08.220 --> 1:25:10.900
 by covering up the dominant eye a little bit each day.

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:12.900
 But I would warn any young people,

1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:15.960
 meaning 12 or younger,

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:18.080
 against creating these imbalances

1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:20.340
 if there isn't a clinical need to do that.

1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:23.700
 And if you do have strong imbalances between the two eyes,

1:25:23.700 --> 1:25:27.500
 which can be caused by cataract and lens issues,

1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:29.900
 can be caused by neuromuscular issues, et cetera,

1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:32.700
 to try and get those dealt with as early as possible

1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:35.380
 by contacting a really good ophthalmologist

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:37.660
 and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.

1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:39.180
 It is very normal.

1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:42.580
 I should say it's very common for young children, babies,

1:25:42.580 --> 1:25:45.340
 to have an eye with strabismus

1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:47.980
 that either deviates out or that deviates in.

1:25:47.980 --> 1:25:50.140
 It is important to correct that

1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:53.180
 if you would like to have balanced vision

1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:54.020
 between the two eyes

1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:57.340
 and for the brain to respond equally to the two eyes

1:25:57.340 --> 1:26:01.440
 and to have, I would say, high-fidelity quality vision.

1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:03.300
 Although some people who have an eye

1:26:03.300 --> 1:26:06.580
 that drifts can function normally in life,

1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:09.220
 you have an opportunity early in life to rescue that.

1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:11.700
 Well, maybe I will do this,

1:26:11.700 --> 1:26:14.500
 but I can actually relax this eye.

1:26:14.500 --> 1:26:16.120
 It's so weak in some cases

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:17.460
 that it actually can start to deviate.

1:26:17.460 --> 1:26:18.380
 Here, I'll just do this here.

1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:19.220
 It's not crossing my eyes.

1:26:19.220 --> 1:26:22.260
 So I actually can move my, I can misalign my eyes

1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:23.940
 because I have to fight very hard

1:26:23.940 --> 1:26:25.740
 to have the musculature for this eye,

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:28.700
 keep that eye aligned with the other eye.

1:26:28.700 --> 1:26:30.920
 And that's because I've been doing eye exercises

1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:32.340
 since I was in my 20s

1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:34.220
 because I noticed when I would study a lot,

1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:35.300
 this eye would start to drift in.

1:26:35.300 --> 1:26:36.200
 I'd start to see double,

1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:38.600
 and then next thing you know, I was just covering the eye up.

1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:39.900
 It was getting weaker and weaker,

1:26:39.900 --> 1:26:41.780
 just like the atrophy of a muscle.

1:26:41.780 --> 1:26:43.100
 So I went to the doctor.

1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:43.940
 What did they do?

1:26:43.940 --> 1:26:45.620
 They did the exact wrong thing.

1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:47.820
 The optometrist I went to gave me a prism,

1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:50.020
 which adjusted it so that I could see things normally,

1:26:50.020 --> 1:26:51.780
 which just made the eye weaker and weaker.

1:26:51.780 --> 1:26:54.600
 It's like putting a weak arm into a sling.

1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:58.700
 So I had to spend at least three years of 10 minutes a day,

1:26:58.700 --> 1:27:01.780
 is what I recommend, doing near-far,

1:27:01.780 --> 1:27:05.900
 covering up my good eye, doing near-far with my bad eye,

1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:09.380
 and now it's been about 10, 12 years

1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:12.460
 that I have pretty decent binocular vision.

1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:14.500
 Now, many of you aren't dealing with this

1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:17.420
 or have these early childhood issues.

1:27:17.420 --> 1:27:20.260
 Some of you might be experiencing challenges

1:27:20.260 --> 1:27:23.060
 with fatigued eyes or with differences

1:27:23.060 --> 1:27:24.260
 in focus with the two eyes.

1:27:24.260 --> 1:27:26.860
 These eye exercises of near-far smooth pursuit

1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:29.960
 and checking for dominant and non-dominant eye

1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.700
 can be very beneficial.

1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:32.820
 Again, I'm not a clinician,

1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:36.780
 so I don't want to give you protocols or enforce protocols

1:27:36.780 --> 1:27:37.620
 on anybody.

1:27:37.620 --> 1:27:39.340
 You need to figure out what's right and safe for you,

1:27:39.340 --> 1:27:42.060
 given your vision history.

1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:44.340
 I do recommend talking to a really good ophthalmologist

1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:46.640
 if you have severe vision problems of any kind,

1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:49.760
 or if you want to offset vision problems of any kind.

1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:51.160
 An optometrist as well,

1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:53.920
 but ideally it would be a neuro-ophthalmologist.

1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:56.580
 Okay, I did mention hallucinations,

1:27:56.580 --> 1:27:58.980
 and they're fun to talk about and think about.

1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:00.460
 For years, people have asked,

1:28:00.460 --> 1:28:03.260
 why do people get visual hallucinations?

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:04.620
 Costello's in sleep right now.

1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:06.680
 You can probably hear him snoring, he's snoring so loud.

1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:09.780
 He's probably having hallucinations about rabbits, pizza,

1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:12.420
 and those are mainly his favorite, and sleep.

1:28:12.420 --> 1:28:14.380
 He's dreaming about sleep in sleep.

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:18.440
 Hallucinations are a property of the visual system,

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:21.940
 and it was always thought that hallucinations arise

1:28:21.940 --> 1:28:24.280
 because of over-activation or activation

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:25.820
 of certain aspects of the visual system.

1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:27.420
 I just briefly want to mention a paper

1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:28.740
 that was published by my good friend

1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:33.040
 and phenomenal scientist and physicist for that matter,

1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:36.580
 Chris Neal, who's up at the University of Oregon in Eugene,

1:28:36.580 --> 1:28:38.940
 they studied LSD-like compounds

1:28:38.940 --> 1:28:42.260
 and discovered that hallucinations actually occur

1:28:42.260 --> 1:28:46.200
 because portions of your brain become underactive.

1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:49.020
 The visual portions of your brain are understimulated.

1:28:49.020 --> 1:28:52.540
 This is probably why when people go into these cave retreats,

1:28:52.540 --> 1:28:55.180
 something I've never done, I don't think I ever will do,

1:28:55.180 --> 1:28:56.760
 where it's completely black,

1:28:56.760 --> 1:28:58.900
 pretty soon they start hallucinating.

1:28:58.900 --> 1:29:01.860
 They start seeing things, even though there's nothing there.

1:29:01.860 --> 1:29:04.880
 The visual system is desperate to make guesses

1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:06.020
 about what's out in the world.

1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:07.520
 It's like the eager beaver of your brain.

1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:08.620
 It's like, what's out there, what's out there,

1:29:08.620 --> 1:29:10.220
 what's out there?

1:29:10.220 --> 1:29:12.940
 Even in low to no vision people, blind people,

1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:15.540
 their brain is going to be making guesses

1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:17.180
 about what's out there in the auditory world,

1:29:17.180 --> 1:29:20.740
 what sounds are there, what touch sensations are there.

1:29:20.740 --> 1:29:23.380
 For sighted folks, it's going to be

1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:24.940
 what's out there in terms of light.

1:29:24.940 --> 1:29:27.180
 Light is the dominant way, vision is the dominant way

1:29:27.180 --> 1:29:29.220
 that we evaluate the world around us.

1:29:29.220 --> 1:29:31.740
 So it turns out that hallucinations

1:29:31.740 --> 1:29:34.220
 are an underactivation of the visual system

1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:36.840
 and then a compensatory, a compensation

1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:39.900
 by which the visual system creates activity

1:29:39.900 --> 1:29:41.020
 and hallucinations.

1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:42.640
 So if you're in the dark long enough,

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:44.660
 you start to hallucinate and see things.

1:29:44.660 --> 1:29:47.680
 So that's a little note about hallucinations.

1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:49.860
 One of the things that you can do to improve your vision,

1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:51.500
 and it's also kind of fun,

1:29:51.500 --> 1:29:54.980
 is to put a Snellen chart in your home.

1:29:54.980 --> 1:29:57.220
 A Snellen chart is that list of letters.

1:29:57.220 --> 1:29:59.840
 If you go to the dreaded Department of Motor Vehicles,

1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:01.120
 actually, I'm up for renewal soon,

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:03.560
 so I love the Department of Motor Vehicles.

1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:04.680
 The Department of Motor Vehicles

1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:06.260
 will have you cover up an eye,

1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:09.420
 read the letters on the chart.

1:30:09.420 --> 1:30:11.060
 The letters, of course, get smaller and smaller.

1:30:11.060 --> 1:30:13.580
 They're trying to figure out roughly what your vision is.

1:30:13.580 --> 1:30:16.480
 Cover up the other eye, you'll do that.

1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:19.580
 Some people, including nerdy vision scientists like me,

1:30:19.580 --> 1:30:22.020
 have had Snellen charts in their office

1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:24.240
 or in their home for many years now,

1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:25.220
 and you can just practice,

1:30:25.220 --> 1:30:26.240
 and you can see how you're doing

1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:27.900
 sitting at a particular distance.

1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:31.200
 This is something that's not often mentioned,

1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:34.540
 but your performance on the Snellen chart will vary

1:30:34.540 --> 1:30:36.140
 depending on time of day,

1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:37.980
 because your level of fatigue

1:30:37.980 --> 1:30:39.900
 and your ability to control that accommodation

1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:42.540
 and other mechanisms of the eye muscles will vary.

1:30:42.540 --> 1:30:44.540
 So you can take it as an average.

1:30:44.540 --> 1:30:46.380
 It's also a good thing

1:30:46.380 --> 1:30:48.100
 if you're going to get your vision tested

1:30:48.100 --> 1:30:49.620
 for corrective lenses,

1:30:49.620 --> 1:30:51.500
 or maybe you're going to do laser surgery

1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:52.540
 or something of that sort.

1:30:52.540 --> 1:30:53.780
 If you're thinking about any of that,

1:30:53.780 --> 1:30:55.620
 to really get it measured by a professional,

1:30:55.620 --> 1:30:57.820
 the ones that you get in those supermarkets

1:30:58.900 --> 1:31:00.980
 or in many eyeglass stores,

1:31:00.980 --> 1:31:02.220
 apologies to the eyeglass stores,

1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:05.420
 are often wrong by an order of magnitude.

1:31:06.360 --> 1:31:08.900
 And then when you start putting corrective lenses on

1:31:08.900 --> 1:31:12.340
 that are over-correcting or under-correcting,

1:31:12.340 --> 1:31:14.340
 but more often are over-correcting,

1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:16.180
 then you're essentially weakening the system.

1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:18.340
 It's like putting a prosthetic on a limb that you didn't

1:31:18.340 --> 1:31:21.220
 necessarily need or a robot arm

1:31:21.220 --> 1:31:23.620
 when you didn't need the use of the robot arm.

1:31:23.620 --> 1:31:25.720
 Although now there's so much excitement about robots,

1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:26.780
 I think people are going to be doing that.

1:31:26.780 --> 1:31:29.140
 Anyway, nonetheless,

1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:30.500
 get your vision tested by somebody

1:31:30.500 --> 1:31:32.100
 who really understands vision,

1:31:32.100 --> 1:31:34.700
 like an ophthalmologist or a really good optometrist.

1:31:35.740 --> 1:31:38.880
 If you put a Snellen chart in your home,

1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:41.380
 you can do that as part of your visual training.

1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:43.380
 Now, this might seem excessively nerdy,

1:31:43.380 --> 1:31:46.760
 but what is more important than your eyesight, right?

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:48.020
 Eyesight is so vital.

1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:49.420
 It's right up there with movement

1:31:49.420 --> 1:31:51.340
 and our ability to move, to generate,

1:31:51.340 --> 1:31:53.340
 to get up out of chairs and to walk and to run

1:31:53.340 --> 1:31:55.240
 and to take care of ourselves.

1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:57.860
 Eyesight and movement are the main ways

1:31:57.860 --> 1:32:00.620
 that we are able to take care of ourselves

1:32:00.620 --> 1:32:01.780
 and take care of others.

1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:03.980
 When you start having compromised eyesight

1:32:03.980 --> 1:32:05.280
 or compromised movement,

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:06.660
 people need to take care of us

1:32:06.660 --> 1:32:08.700
 and we become much more challenged

1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:10.320
 in moving through our daily life.

1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:12.340
 So while it might seem nerdy to have a Snellen chart

1:32:12.340 --> 1:32:15.700
 in your home or to do a smooth pursuit exercise

1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:16.540
 a couple of times a week

1:32:16.540 --> 1:32:18.100
 or to get outside for a few hours a day

1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:20.780
 and do your reading or your laptop work there,

1:32:20.780 --> 1:32:23.220
 preserving your eyesight and preserving your vision

1:32:23.220 --> 1:32:25.660
 is one of the most life enhancing

1:32:25.660 --> 1:32:27.940
 or quality of life enhancing things that you can do.

1:32:27.940 --> 1:32:29.580
 And if you're a young person

1:32:29.580 --> 1:32:32.820
 and you can build some of this into your framework

1:32:32.820 --> 1:32:36.300
 of exercise or brain training, if you want to call it that,

1:32:36.300 --> 1:32:37.540
 that can be immensely beneficial

1:32:37.540 --> 1:32:39.900
 and will really set you up to have really good vision

1:32:39.900 --> 1:32:41.260
 over a long period of time.

1:32:41.260 --> 1:32:42.940
 Now, of course there are genetic factors

1:32:42.940 --> 1:32:45.300
 and there are injury related factors

1:32:45.300 --> 1:32:48.500
 that can compromise eyesight and our ability to see.

1:32:48.500 --> 1:32:51.620
 And of course, the things I'm talking about today

1:32:51.620 --> 1:32:53.500
 aren't going to solve all those issues

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:57.000
 but they can have a tremendous positive impact

1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:58.900
 if you're willing to do just a little bit of work

1:32:58.900 --> 1:33:02.660
 and none of this is involving any cost, right?

1:33:02.660 --> 1:33:04.320
 It's just time cost.

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:06.840
 So I do want to talk about a few other things

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:09.360
 that can perhaps improve vision.

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:12.340
 I want to dispel a few myths about stuff to take

1:33:12.340 --> 1:33:13.540
 to improve vision.

1:33:13.540 --> 1:33:15.780
 And then I want to just close

1:33:15.780 --> 1:33:19.800
 by talking about how we perceive time using our vision

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:21.460
 because that will nicely set the stage

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:23.980
 for what we're going to talk about next episode.

1:33:23.980 --> 1:33:27.540
 So now you understand a lot about the biology of vision.

1:33:27.540 --> 1:33:29.540
 You understand that light has to arrive at the retina

1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:32.020
 and get converted into electrical signals.

1:33:32.020 --> 1:33:36.420
 That process requires things like vitamin A,

1:33:36.420 --> 1:33:38.540
 a fat soluble vitamin.

1:33:38.540 --> 1:33:42.060
 It requires things like the carotenoids.

1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:45.440
 That metabolic cascade, the biochemical cascade

1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:47.820
 is essential for vision.

1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:49.220
 And this is why you've been told

1:33:49.220 --> 1:33:50.900
 that carrots help you see better

1:33:50.900 --> 1:33:52.500
 because they're high in vitamin A.

1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:55.340
 There are a few simple things you can do

1:33:55.340 --> 1:33:56.820
 to support your vision.

1:33:56.820 --> 1:34:01.820
 First of all, it is true that eating vegetables,

1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:05.060
 the dark leafy vegetables and things like carrots

1:34:05.060 --> 1:34:08.020
 that have vitamin A in abundance

1:34:08.020 --> 1:34:11.160
 and eating them in close to their raw form.

1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:14.740
 So naturally occurring foods that contain a lot of vitamin A

1:34:14.740 --> 1:34:19.420
 in their raw form can help support vision.

1:34:19.420 --> 1:34:20.260
 Now, does that mean that

1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:23.540
 if you ingest super physiological amounts of that stuff

1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:25.800
 that it's going to make your vision that much better?

1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:29.580
 No, but you do need a threshold level of vitamin A

1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:33.740
 in order to see and in order to see well.

1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:36.560
 Now, there's a lot of excitement nowadays

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.300
 about supplementation to help support

1:34:39.300 --> 1:34:40.740
 the health of the visual system.

1:34:40.740 --> 1:34:43.060
 And I'm somebody who's pretty open

1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:45.180
 to novel forms of supplementation.

1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:46.220
 You've probably gathered that

1:34:46.220 --> 1:34:48.800
 if you've been listening to this podcast for a while.

1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:51.780
 You have to determine what's safe and economical

1:34:51.780 --> 1:34:55.660
 and right for you, what your risk tolerance is, et cetera.

1:34:55.660 --> 1:34:58.620
 But I want to talk about a molecule

1:34:58.620 --> 1:35:01.700
 that's in a lot of supplements to support vision.

1:35:01.700 --> 1:35:05.900
 And there are some really good data on and that's lutein.

1:35:05.900 --> 1:35:07.620
 Now, the study I want to describe

1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:11.300
 is actually published in 2016.

1:35:11.300 --> 1:35:12.980
 It's from the Journal of Ophthalmology.

1:35:12.980 --> 1:35:15.060
 It's a good journal.

1:35:15.060 --> 1:35:18.360
 And the title of this paper might catch your attention.

1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:22.020
 It's increased macular pigment optical density.

1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:25.980
 That just means that the macula is an area of the eye

1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:28.180
 for central vision, for high acuity vision.

1:35:29.060 --> 1:35:31.180
 Pigment density there is good.

1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:32.860
 You want pigment there.

1:35:32.860 --> 1:35:35.760
 Increased macular pigment optical density.

1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:37.580
 And visual acuity, visual acuity

1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:40.420
 is your ability to see things in fine detail.

1:35:40.420 --> 1:35:43.060
 Following consumption of a buttermilk drink

1:35:43.060 --> 1:35:45.680
 containing lutein enriched egg yolks.

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:49.160
 Remember raw foods, lutein enriched egg yolks.

1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:50.420
 Sounds like a Rocky movie

1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:52.820
 where he would drink the raw egg yolks.

1:35:52.820 --> 1:35:56.160
 A randomized double blind placebo controlled trial.

1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:59.460
 Now I'm not suggesting you go out and eat raw egg yolks.

1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:00.580
 There's the risk of salmonella.

1:36:00.580 --> 1:36:02.740
 Although I did hear this, someone correct me if I'm wrong,

1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:06.020
 but the salmonella is actually on the outside of the egg,

1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:07.700
 not actually in the egg itself.

1:36:07.700 --> 1:36:10.860
 It's on the shell for reasons that relate

1:36:10.860 --> 1:36:13.280
 to how that egg got into the world.

1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:15.100
 That's where the salmonella lives.

1:36:15.100 --> 1:36:17.300
 But I could be wrong about that.

1:36:17.300 --> 1:36:19.700
 But raw egg yolks are not something

1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:21.920
 that most people want to consume.

1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:23.260
 What is this lutein stuff?

1:36:23.260 --> 1:36:27.540
 Well, lutein is in the pathway that relates to vitamin A

1:36:27.540 --> 1:36:31.940
 and the formation of the opsin, the photopigment

1:36:31.940 --> 1:36:33.820
 that captures light in the back of your eye,

1:36:33.820 --> 1:36:37.460
 literally absorbs light pigment in your eye

1:36:37.460 --> 1:36:39.300
 and converts that into electrical signals

1:36:39.300 --> 1:36:40.500
 and allows you to see.

1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:42.340
 And there is some evidence.

1:36:42.340 --> 1:36:44.320
 I spoke to our chair of ophthalmology.

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:48.060
 There is some evidence through quality peer reviewed studies

1:36:48.060 --> 1:36:53.060
 that supplementing with lutein can help offset

1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:56.260
 some of the detrimental effects

1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:58.760
 of age-related macular degeneration.

1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:03.100
 But, I want to emphasize but or emphasize however,

1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:07.100
 only for individuals with moderate

1:37:07.100 --> 1:37:09.540
 to severe macular degeneration.

1:37:09.540 --> 1:37:11.580
 For people that have normal vision

1:37:11.580 --> 1:37:16.580
 or with just a low degree of macular degeneration,

1:37:16.740 --> 1:37:19.300
 these studies did not see a significant improvement

1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:21.980
 of vision from supplementing with lutein.

1:37:21.980 --> 1:37:22.980
 So I'm not going to tell you

1:37:22.980 --> 1:37:24.760
 to supplement with lutein or not.

1:37:26.140 --> 1:37:27.980
 I don't think any study is holy,

1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:30.620
 but it does seem that if you have moderate

1:37:30.620 --> 1:37:32.600
 to severe macular degeneration,

1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:33.800
 talk to your physician of course,

1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:35.140
 talk to your ophthalmologist.

1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:37.540
 I'll always say that and I'll say it three times.

1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:42.960
 Supplementing with lutein could perhaps support vision

1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:45.020
 and offset some vision loss in that case.

1:37:45.020 --> 1:37:46.980
 Probably also talk to your ophthalmologist

1:37:46.980 --> 1:37:48.300
 or consider the red light therapy

1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:49.720
 that I talked about earlier.

1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:51.900
 Whereas if you have normal vision

1:37:51.900 --> 1:37:55.500
 or a low amount of macular degeneration,

1:37:55.500 --> 1:37:57.500
 it does not seem at least from these studies

1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:59.720
 that lutein can have much of an effect.

1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:03.820
 Now I know and I confess I'm sort of of the mind

1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:08.820
 that if I personally had age-related macular degeneration

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.700
 or a propensity for it in my family,

1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:11.980
 which fortunately I don't,

1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:16.580
 but in that case, I would think that supplementing

1:38:16.580 --> 1:38:20.500
 with lutein provided it's safe could perhaps be of benefit

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:22.440
 and you might want to consider a low dose of that.

1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:25.040
 So again, I'm not pushing any of this on anybody

1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:27.180
 by any means, but you should know

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:29.020
 that under certain conditions

1:38:29.020 --> 1:38:30.460
 of severe macular degeneration

1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:31.820
 or moderate macular degeneration,

1:38:31.820 --> 1:38:33.380
 it does seem like lutein can be beneficial.

1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:36.060
 It does not have to be consumed through raw egg yolks,

1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.860
 although that is the highest density source.

1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:43.440
 Cooking your eggs, if you like your scrambled eggs dry

1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:48.340
 or you like your eggs not easy over or whatever, not runny,

1:38:48.340 --> 1:38:50.980
 then you aren't going to get the benefits of the leucine.

1:38:50.980 --> 1:38:52.380
 There are other sources of leucine,

1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:53.880
 non-animal sources of leucine as well.

1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:56.980
 You can look those up on the internet.

1:38:56.980 --> 1:39:00.800
 Now, there are other compounds that have been shown

1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:03.020
 to perhaps be important for offsetting

1:39:03.020 --> 1:39:06.460
 or helping different forms of vision loss.

1:39:06.460 --> 1:39:08.420
 One is, I'm going to spell this out,

1:39:08.420 --> 1:39:13.420
 I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E, indebene, indebenone, indebenone.

1:39:14.860 --> 1:39:16.700
 I can never pronounce these compounds.

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:19.380
 Forgive me, unless I've worked with them.

1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:22.580
 There is evidence that it can be beneficial

1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:27.540
 for Lieber's congenital eye disease.

1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:29.980
 I would definitely go onto examine.com,

1:39:29.980 --> 1:39:32.700
 put in I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E,

1:39:32.700 --> 1:39:36.580
 and for things like Lieber's optic neuropathies,

1:39:36.580 --> 1:39:38.780
 which is a degenerative condition of the eye.

1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:42.100
 Whether or not people should just be taking this stuff anyway

1:39:42.100 --> 1:39:43.220
 is still an open question.

1:39:43.220 --> 1:39:45.260
 There aren't a lot of studies about it.

1:39:45.260 --> 1:39:47.460
 A lot of people that are interested in taking things

1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:50.460
 to support their vision are taking leucine

1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:53.020
 as a preventative measure.

1:39:53.020 --> 1:39:55.380
 I don't pass any judgment one way or the other.

1:39:55.380 --> 1:39:58.820
 Typically, those supplements also include

1:39:58.820 --> 1:40:02.500
 the zeaxathins and the astaxyns.

1:40:02.500 --> 1:40:05.660
 Okay, the pronunciation of this is terrible, I'm sure,

1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:07.020
 but that's not too far off,

1:40:07.020 --> 1:40:12.020
 but basically, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

1:40:12.820 --> 1:40:13.820
 Let's see what I start to pronounce.

1:40:13.820 --> 1:40:16.980
 Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:21.420
 And the other one is A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

1:40:21.420 --> 1:40:24.420
 Both of these have been shown, excuse me,

1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:27.740
 both of these have been shown to offset

1:40:27.740 --> 1:40:32.740
 some of the disruption in vision that occurs with aging.

1:40:32.740 --> 1:40:35.340
 What is astaxaxin?

1:40:35.340 --> 1:40:37.420
 It's a really interesting compound.

1:40:37.420 --> 1:40:41.120
 It's the red pink pigment found in various seafoods.

1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:43.860
 So shrimp, I'm not a big seafood fan,

1:40:43.860 --> 1:40:47.180
 but like certain fish, like you'll see at the fish market,

1:40:47.180 --> 1:40:49.500
 will have that red pink pigment,

1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:51.740
 and it's also in the feathers of flamingos.

1:40:51.740 --> 1:40:54.240
 Please don't eat the feathers of flamingos,

1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:56.320
 and please also don't eat flamingos.

1:40:57.260 --> 1:40:59.500
 It's structurally similar to beta carotene,

1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:01.980
 so it's very pro vitamin A,

1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:03.680
 but it has some chemical differences

1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:05.860
 which may make it safer than vitamin A.

1:41:05.860 --> 1:41:09.180
 Remember, vitamin A is a lipid-soluble vitamin,

1:41:09.180 --> 1:41:12.700
 so it can be stored in our body for long periods of time.

1:41:12.700 --> 1:41:15.520
 What is the deal with this astaxaxin?

1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:16.460
 What are its drawbacks?

1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:20.740
 Well, we can go to our ever favorite, examine.com.

1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:21.580
 What does it do?

1:41:21.580 --> 1:41:23.400
 Well, it has a number of different effects,

1:41:23.400 --> 1:41:24.380
 a huge number, in fact,

1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:27.800
 but it does seem to notably increase,

1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:29.600
 it's now been shown in three studies,

1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:32.800
 the antioxidant enzyme profile.

1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:34.820
 It has a number of different effects,

1:41:34.820 --> 1:41:36.780
 but the most notable for sake of this episode

1:41:36.780 --> 1:41:39.140
 is the one on ocular blood flow.

1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:41.900
 It does seem to increase the amount of ocular blood flow,

1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:43.700
 so the blood supply to the eyes,

1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:46.060
 so that makes it an interesting compound.

1:41:46.060 --> 1:41:47.900
 There's a number of other effects.

1:41:47.900 --> 1:41:51.760
 For whatever reason, it also has a notable effect,

1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.580
 several studies have shown this, on fertility in males,

1:41:55.580 --> 1:41:59.600
 so it seems to at least double the pregnancy rate

1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:04.600
 when men take astaxanthin and works as,

1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:06.900
 in particular, it seems here,

1:42:06.900 --> 1:42:08.600
 in men that were previously infertile,

1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:11.220
 so I don't know if that has something to do

1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:13.340
 with the blood flow to the eyes, probably not.

1:42:13.340 --> 1:42:14.180
 It probably has something to do

1:42:14.180 --> 1:42:16.620
 with something unrelated to the eyes.

1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:19.100
 Nonetheless, that's an effect of this molecule.

1:42:19.100 --> 1:42:21.820
 It's also been shown to have positive effects

1:42:21.820 --> 1:42:24.260
 on things like skin elasticity, skin moisture,

1:42:24.260 --> 1:42:25.780
 skin quality, et cetera,

1:42:25.780 --> 1:42:28.740
 probably due to its effects on blood flow.

1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:33.740
 So lutein, astaxanthin, A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N,

1:42:34.380 --> 1:42:37.340
 and for people who have concerns

1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:39.400
 about Leber's optic neuropathies,

1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:41.740
 which is going to be a small percentage of people out there,

1:42:41.740 --> 1:42:44.080
 but that is a pretty severe condition,

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.960
 there are supplements that are available out there.

1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:48.200
 I do encourage you, as always,

1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:51.580
 to talk to your ophthalmologist and physician about them.

1:42:51.580 --> 1:42:53.620
 And I will say that there are a number of people

1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:56.140
 that take lutein and some of these other things

1:42:56.140 --> 1:42:59.220
 as a precautionary measure in order to bolster their health

1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:01.540
 in the same way that some people take vitamins and minerals

1:43:01.540 --> 1:43:02.380
 to bolster their health,

1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:04.260
 and some people are very, health, excuse me,

1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:05.860
 and some people are very averse

1:43:05.860 --> 1:43:07.080
 to taking vitamins and minerals

1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:08.640
 because they feel like they can get all that

1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:10.060
 from healthy whole foods.

1:43:10.060 --> 1:43:13.820
 And of course, you can get these things from whole foods.

1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:14.660
 The question is whether or not

1:43:14.660 --> 1:43:17.300
 you can get them in concentrations that are sufficient.

1:43:17.300 --> 1:43:19.220
 I do think that in the years to come,

1:43:19.220 --> 1:43:21.900
 we are going to see more about lutein.

1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:23.780
 I think we are going to see

1:43:23.780 --> 1:43:25.840
 more about some of these other compounds,

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:29.020
 like astaxanthin, and hopefully by then

1:43:29.020 --> 1:43:30.780
 I'll be able to pronounce it.

1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:34.160
 But at present, these things are more or less

1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:36.900
 in the kind of experimental or self-experimental phase.

1:43:36.900 --> 1:43:39.220
 There are some good double-blind placebo-controlled studies

1:43:39.220 --> 1:43:41.840
 like the egg yolk buttermilk study of all things,

1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:43.500
 published in really good journals.

1:43:43.500 --> 1:43:44.740
 Journal of Ophthalmology,

1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:48.760
 Journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences,

1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:50.400
 these are good journals.

1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:53.360
 These are journals that are peer-reviewed by experts.

1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:57.920
 The study that I mentioned earlier about keeping rooms dark,

1:43:57.920 --> 1:43:59.860
 that was also published in an excellent journal.

1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:01.940
 I think it was JAMA, I'll go back and look.

1:44:01.940 --> 1:44:04.860
 It's not on my screen any longer, but very easy to find,

1:44:04.860 --> 1:44:06.420
 and there've been some follow-up studies as well

1:44:06.420 --> 1:44:09.620
 from the University of Pennsylvania and other universities.

1:44:09.620 --> 1:44:11.560
 So everything I've talked about today

1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:13.820
 relates to studies that were done

1:44:13.820 --> 1:44:15.940
 and published in quality peer-reviewed journals.

1:44:15.940 --> 1:44:17.800
 That doesn't necessarily mean you want to run out

1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:19.940
 and start taking the stuff that I've described,

1:44:19.940 --> 1:44:21.620
 or even doing the protocols I've described.

1:44:21.620 --> 1:44:24.620
 I've given you an array, a palette, a buffet, if you will,

1:44:24.620 --> 1:44:26.740
 of things that you could do to try and enhance

1:44:26.740 --> 1:44:30.060
 or support your vision, depending on how good your vision is

1:44:30.060 --> 1:44:33.300
 your family history of vision and vision loss,

1:44:33.300 --> 1:44:35.340
 your occupational hazards,

1:44:35.340 --> 1:44:38.060
 people that work with metal filings

1:44:38.060 --> 1:44:39.580
 that are flying out of machines

1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:44.420
 are going to have a higher degree of risk

1:44:44.420 --> 1:44:45.500
 to their visual system

1:44:45.500 --> 1:44:47.060
 than will people who just do office work.

1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:48.940
 Although if you're doing a lot of office work,

1:44:48.940 --> 1:44:51.660
 chances are you're not getting a lot of long view vision,

1:44:51.660 --> 1:44:52.960
 your accommodation mechanisms

1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:54.480
 are going to start to suffer over time.

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:56.660
 I think we can reliably predict that.

1:44:56.660 --> 1:44:59.520
 So I've tried to give you an array of behavioral tools,

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:03.060
 and we did touch upon some supplementation tools.

1:45:03.060 --> 1:45:04.860
 I'd be remiss if I didn't say that

1:45:04.860 --> 1:45:07.160
 because blood flow is so critical

1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:08.100
 for the neurons of the eye.

1:45:08.100 --> 1:45:10.120
 Remember, these are the most metabolically active cells

1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:12.760
 in your entire body, the cells within your retina,

1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:14.620
 because blood flow is required to get them

1:45:14.620 --> 1:45:16.220
 the energy and nutrients they need.

1:45:16.220 --> 1:45:19.360
 Having a healthy cardiovascular system, right?

1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:23.100
 Doing endurance work, doing strength training work regularly

1:45:23.100 --> 1:45:25.780
 is going to support your eyes and your brain

1:45:25.780 --> 1:45:26.600
 and your vision.

1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:28.860
 It's indirect, but it's essential, right?

1:45:28.860 --> 1:45:31.740
 It's necessary, but it's not going to be sufficient.

1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:33.100
 You're going to have to do other things

1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:34.820
 to support your eyesight as well.

1:45:34.820 --> 1:45:36.700
 But having a healthy cardiovascular system

1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:39.420
 because it's going to deliver blood and oxygen

1:45:39.420 --> 1:45:42.500
 and nutrients to this incredible apparati

1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:45.900
 on the front of your face, these two pieces of brain,

1:45:45.900 --> 1:45:48.420
 is going to support your overall brain health

1:45:48.420 --> 1:45:50.080
 and vision over time.

1:45:50.080 --> 1:45:51.740
 So early in the podcast, I talked about

1:45:51.740 --> 1:45:54.700
 how the optimal window for learning is 90 minutes.

1:45:54.700 --> 1:45:57.420
 That's the so-called ultradian cycle for learning.

1:45:57.420 --> 1:45:59.480
 That's why we held our episodes to about 90 minutes.

1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:02.140
 They're now starting to extend into the hour and 50 minute

1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:03.660
 and two hour mark.

1:46:03.660 --> 1:46:06.060
 That simply reflects my enthusiasm and excitement

1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:07.700
 about these topics and my desire to give you

1:46:07.700 --> 1:46:10.980
 as much information as I possibly can in each episode.

1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:12.400
 Please remember, you don't have to listen

1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:14.060
 to the whole episode all at once.

1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:15.140
 Everything is timestamped.

1:46:15.140 --> 1:46:17.940
 Everything is captioned in English and Spanish.

1:46:17.940 --> 1:46:20.220
 The captions take a few days on YouTube.

1:46:20.220 --> 1:46:21.100
 We apologize for that,

1:46:21.100 --> 1:46:23.140
 but in order to have them done correctly,

1:46:23.140 --> 1:46:25.900
 it takes a few days after it's posted.

1:46:25.900 --> 1:46:27.980
 So if you need those captions,

1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:31.380
 please check back maybe 24 or 48 hours

1:46:31.380 --> 1:46:33.420
 after the episodes are released.

1:46:33.420 --> 1:46:36.020
 If you're enjoying this podcast and the information,

1:46:36.020 --> 1:46:37.480
 if you're finding it beneficial,

1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:38.420
 there are a couple of things that you can do

1:46:38.420 --> 1:46:40.860
 that are totally zero cost that really help us

1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:44.260
 and help you get this information going forward.

1:46:44.260 --> 1:46:46.740
 One is if you don't already subscribe on YouTube,

1:46:46.740 --> 1:46:48.400
 please do subscribe.

1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:50.540
 We release episodes every Monday and hopefully soon,

1:46:50.540 --> 1:46:53.180
 more often than that, shorter episodes as well.

1:46:53.180 --> 1:46:54.820
 But every Monday we release an episode,

1:46:54.820 --> 1:46:56.780
 please do subscribe.

1:46:56.780 --> 1:46:59.240
 If you don't already subscribe on Apple and Spotify,

1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:01.720
 that's very beneficial, please do that.

1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:03.020
 That helps us as well.

1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:04.900
 If you could give us a five star review on Apple,

1:47:04.900 --> 1:47:06.780
 if you feel that that's what we deserve

1:47:06.780 --> 1:47:08.660
 and Apple also gives you the opportunity

1:47:08.660 --> 1:47:11.640
 to give us comments, feedback about the episodes.

1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:13.660
 If you have suggestions about episodes,

1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:15.660
 feedback of any kind,

1:47:15.660 --> 1:47:19.120
 please put it in the comment section on YouTube.

1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:20.340
 Routinely throughout the week

1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:21.820
 after the release of each episode,

1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:23.580
 I cover content in shorter format

1:47:23.580 --> 1:47:26.120
 and in more depth on Instagram at Huberman Lab.

1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:31.860
 Every episode is also indexed and searchable

1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:34.820
 in the search function on our website, HubermanLab.com.

1:47:34.820 --> 1:47:37.820
 That's also where we post links to various studies

1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:40.620
 and downloadable protocols, all zero cost.

1:47:40.620 --> 1:47:42.760
 And as I mentioned, you can search for different topics

1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:45.200
 and it will bring you to the particular episodes

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:48.020
 that contain the information on those topics.

1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:50.500
 If you'd like to support us on Patreon,

1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:51.620
 we have a Patreon account,

1:47:51.620 --> 1:47:54.780
 it's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:47:54.780 --> 1:47:57.400
 There you can support us at any level that you like.

1:47:57.400 --> 1:47:59.540
 As well, if you'd like to support us,

1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.020
 please check out our sponsors.

1:48:01.020 --> 1:48:02.180
 The sponsors that we discussed

1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:03.580
 at the beginning of the podcast

1:48:03.580 --> 1:48:05.620
 are a vital way to keep the information

1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:07.980
 being distributed at zero cost to everybody.

1:48:09.020 --> 1:48:10.480
 We only work with sponsors

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:12.600
 that we really love their products

1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:14.020
 and that we really respect the people

1:48:14.020 --> 1:48:15.540
 that we're working with there.

1:48:15.540 --> 1:48:18.220
 And of course, there's no obligation to purchase

1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:19.920
 or to even check out those sponsors,

1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:21.300
 but if you're in a position to do so,

1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:23.040
 that really does help us.

1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:24.460
 Routinely throughout the podcast,

1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:25.520
 we talk about supplements.

1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:26.780
 There are a lot of supplement companies

1:48:26.780 --> 1:48:28.940
 and sources of supplements out there.

1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:30.700
 The one that we work with and that we partnered with

1:48:30.700 --> 1:48:33.160
 is Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:35.340
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

1:48:35.340 --> 1:48:38.300
 in terms of what they say is in their supplements

1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:39.380
 is actually in their supplements

1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:41.220
 because it's independently tested and verified,

1:48:41.220 --> 1:48:44.200
 as well as the amounts that they list on the bottles

1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:47.620
 actually are matched by what's in the capsules and tablets.

1:48:47.620 --> 1:48:49.820
 That's a serious problem in the supplement industry.

1:48:49.820 --> 1:48:52.880
 And Thorne deals with that problem by being very truthful

1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:55.200
 and very accurate about what's in their supplements

1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:56.820
 and how much of those things are in there.

1:48:56.820 --> 1:48:58.660
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:01.340
 you can go to Thorne, thorne.com,

1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:04.340
 slash the letter U, slash Huberman.

1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:06.580
 There you'll see all the supplements that I take.

1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:08.820
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements,

1:49:08.820 --> 1:49:11.300
 as well as 20% off any of the other supplements

1:49:11.300 --> 1:49:13.040
 that Thorne happens to make

1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:14.740
 if you happen to navigate into their website

1:49:14.740 --> 1:49:17.500
 through that portal, thorne.com,

1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:19.860
 slash the letter U, slash Huberman.

1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:21.260
 And last but not least,

1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:23.380
 I want to thank you for your time and attention today,

1:49:23.380 --> 1:49:25.020
 your willingness to learn about vision

1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:27.560
 in the visual system and the various things that you can do

1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:28.820
 to help support the health

1:49:28.820 --> 1:49:30.780
 and functioning of your visual system.

1:49:30.780 --> 1:49:31.920
 And of course, I want to thank you

1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:33.460
 for your interest in science.

1:49:33.460 --> 1:49:58.380
 I'll see you in the next one.
