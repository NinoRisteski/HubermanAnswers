00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.420
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.420 --> 00:13.460
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.460 --> 00:15.560
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.340
 Today, we are discussing grief.

00:18.340 --> 00:21.900
 Grief is a natural emotion that most everybody experiences

00:21.900 --> 00:24.260
 at some point in their life.

00:24.260 --> 00:25.600
 However, grief is something

00:25.600 --> 00:27.820
 that still mystifies most people.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.660
 For instance, we often wonder why getting over

00:30.660 --> 00:35.660
 the loss of somebody or a pet is so absolutely crushing.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.860
 In some cases, it's obvious

00:37.860 --> 00:39.860
 because we had a very close relationship

00:39.860 --> 00:41.720
 to that person or animal.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.380
 But in other cases, it's bewildering

00:44.380 --> 00:46.900
 because somehow, despite our best efforts,

00:46.900 --> 00:51.140
 we are unable to reframe and shift our mind to the idea

00:51.140 --> 00:54.380
 that the person or animal that at one point was here

00:54.380 --> 00:57.620
 and so very present is now gone.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.940
 Today, we are going to discuss how we conceptualize grief,

01:00.940 --> 01:03.980
 both at an emotional and at a logical level.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.860
 I'm going to teach you about the neuroscience

01:05.860 --> 01:09.620
 and the psychology of grief and incredible findings

01:09.620 --> 01:12.760
 that have been made in just a few key laboratories

01:12.760 --> 01:16.580
 that point to the fact that we essentially map

01:16.580 --> 01:19.940
 our experience of people in three dimensions.

01:19.940 --> 01:21.100
 Let's just give you a little hint

01:21.100 --> 01:22.740
 of what those dimensions are.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.480
 They relate to space, where people are,

01:25.480 --> 01:29.580
 time, when people are, I'll explain what that means,

01:29.580 --> 01:32.160
 and a dimension called closeness

01:32.160 --> 01:35.840
 and how those three dimensions of space, time, and closeness

01:35.840 --> 01:39.100
 are what establish very close bonds with people

01:39.100 --> 01:42.360
 and are what require remapping, reorganization

01:42.360 --> 01:45.500
 within our emotional framework and our logical framework

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
 when we lose somebody for whatever reason.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.860
 Within that understanding, I'm confident

01:50.860 --> 01:54.640
 that you will have greater insight into the grief process.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.580
 And should you ever find yourself within the grief process,

01:57.580 --> 02:01.160
 as I imagine most everyone will at some point,

02:01.160 --> 02:03.540
 you will be able to navigate that process

02:03.540 --> 02:06.220
 in what psychologists and neuroscientists deem to be

02:06.220 --> 02:09.260
 the most healthy way of going through grief.

02:09.260 --> 02:12.260
 Indeed, moving through grief requires a specific form

02:12.260 --> 02:15.920
 of neuroplasticity, a reordering of brain connections,

02:15.920 --> 02:18.780
 and also the connections between the brain and body.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.740
 I'm going to teach you about all of that today.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.000
 So you're going to learn a lot of scientific information.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.620
 You will also learn a lot of tools

02:25.620 --> 02:27.980
 that you can put in your kit of emotional

02:27.980 --> 02:30.720
 and really emotional physical tools

02:30.720 --> 02:32.260
 that will allow you to move through grief

02:32.260 --> 02:35.060
 in this healthy way that I referred to earlier.

02:35.060 --> 02:37.820
 I'll also point out some of the myths about grief.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.300
 For instance, many of you have probably heard

02:39.300 --> 02:41.300
 that there are designated stages of grief

02:41.300 --> 02:43.060
 that everybody moves through.

02:43.060 --> 02:46.740
 It turns out that recent research refutes that idea.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.100
 There are different stages of grief,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.380
 but not everybody experiences all of them.

02:50.380 --> 02:53.060
 And hardly ever does somebody move through

02:53.060 --> 02:55.740
 all of those linearly, meaning in the same order.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.860
 I also want to point out that for many of you

02:57.860 --> 03:00.980
 that are not experiencing grief in this moment,

03:00.980 --> 03:03.540
 there's an important scientific literature

03:03.540 --> 03:07.100
 that teaches us that how we show up to grief,

03:07.100 --> 03:10.640
 meaning our psychological and our biological state

03:10.640 --> 03:14.320
 that we happen to be in when a loss occurs,

03:14.320 --> 03:16.480
 strongly dictates whether or not we end up

03:16.480 --> 03:19.820
 in what's called complicated or non-complicated grief.

03:19.820 --> 03:23.140
 And non-complicated grief is a form of grief

03:23.140 --> 03:24.720
 that is very prolonged.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.940
 And in fact, often requires that people get

03:26.940 --> 03:28.900
 substantial professional help.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.120
 So whether or not you're experiencing grief,

03:31.120 --> 03:35.180
 that's mild, moderate, or very intense right now,

03:35.180 --> 03:37.380
 or whether or not you are not experiencing

03:37.380 --> 03:39.100
 any grief at all,

03:39.100 --> 03:40.820
 you're going to learn scientific information

03:40.820 --> 03:42.860
 and tools that will help you navigate

03:42.860 --> 03:45.380
 through this process that we call grief.

03:45.380 --> 03:48.020
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:48.020 --> 03:50.940
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.180
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:53.180 --> 03:55.860
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:55.860 --> 03:58.660
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:58.660 --> 03:59.740
 In keeping with that theme,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.540
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:02.540 --> 04:05.140
 Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.860
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

04:06.860 --> 04:11.000
 that have cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.640
 I recently started sleeping

04:12.640 --> 04:14.900
 with an Eight Sleep mattress cover,

04:14.900 --> 04:17.180
 and I am so glad that I did

04:17.180 --> 04:19.980
 because the sleep that I'm getting is superb

04:19.980 --> 04:21.860
 compared to the sleep I was getting previously.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.540
 I always thought that I slept pretty well,

04:23.540 --> 04:25.620
 especially since I apply a number of different tools

04:25.620 --> 04:27.860
 in order to sleep well,

04:27.860 --> 04:28.800
 things like supplements,

04:28.800 --> 04:31.000
 things like keeping the room cool, et cetera,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.820
 but I have had a repeating problem over the years,

04:33.820 --> 04:35.100
 which is that I would wake up

04:35.100 --> 04:36.540
 in the middle of the night often

04:36.540 --> 04:38.620
 and sometimes have a bit of trouble

04:38.620 --> 04:40.580
 or a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.660
 I would have to apply other tools

04:42.660 --> 04:44.340
 in order to get back to sleep.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.100
 Eight Sleep allows me to adjust

04:46.100 --> 04:48.900
 the temperature of my mattress and my sleeping environment

04:48.900 --> 04:50.500
 so that I fall asleep easily

04:50.500 --> 04:52.380
 and stay asleep throughout the night,

04:52.380 --> 04:55.520
 which as many of you know, is a game changer.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.580
 Temperature is a powerful regulator of sleep

04:57.580 --> 04:58.860
 and the ability to get into sleep.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.900
 We know for instance,

04:59.900 --> 05:02.820
 that the body needs to drop by one to three degrees

05:02.820 --> 05:04.900
 in order to get into sleep and to stay asleep.

05:04.900 --> 05:05.820
 And with Eight Sleep,

05:05.820 --> 05:07.560
 I can program the temperature of my bed

05:07.560 --> 05:10.300
 so that it gets cooler as I fall asleep,

05:10.300 --> 05:12.060
 gets even colder as I enter deep sleep

05:12.060 --> 05:14.020
 and at the transition to REM sleep,

05:14.020 --> 05:15.420
 rapid eye movement sleep,

05:15.420 --> 05:17.020
 it can get even cooler if I like.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.660
 I actually like to maintain the same temperature

05:18.660 --> 05:20.020
 through deep and REM sleep.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.740
 And then it heats up slightly as I head towards morning

05:22.740 --> 05:25.420
 because of course heating up of the body

05:25.420 --> 05:27.780
 is one way in which we wake up.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.500
 So I have this nice contour of cooling and heating

05:30.500 --> 05:32.260
 that puts me through a beautiful arc

05:32.260 --> 05:35.220
 of falling and staying asleep and waking up when I want to.

05:35.220 --> 05:36.460

05:58.180 --> 06:01.100
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.600
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:03.600 --> 06:06.440
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:06.440 --> 06:08.020
 to help you better understand your body

06:08.020 --> 06:10.140
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:10.140 --> 06:13.100
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

06:13.100 --> 06:15.220
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:15.220 --> 06:17.460
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:17.460 --> 06:19.980
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.860
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

06:22.860 --> 06:24.900
 you can also get insight into, for instance,

06:24.900 --> 06:26.360
 what your biological age is

06:26.360 --> 06:28.540
 and compare that to your chronological age.

06:28.540 --> 06:29.860
 And of course your biological age

06:29.860 --> 06:32.360
 is the number that truly matters.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.840
 One issue with a lot of blood tests

06:33.840 --> 06:35.780
 and DNA tests out there, however,

06:35.780 --> 06:38.540
 is that you get values back about metabolic factors,

06:38.540 --> 06:40.680
 hormones and lipids, et cetera,

06:40.680 --> 06:43.100
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.740
 Inside Tracker solves that problem.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.400
 They have a very easy to use personalized platform.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.340
 It's a website where you can literally place your cursor

06:51.340 --> 06:53.540
 over a given value,

06:53.540 --> 06:56.460
 say for a hormone or metabolic factor or lipid.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.340
 And it will tell you what you can do

06:58.340 --> 07:00.820
 in terms of nutrition, behaviors and supplementation

07:00.820 --> 07:02.740
 in order to bring those values into the range

07:02.740 --> 07:05.180
 that are optimal for you and your health.

07:05.180 --> 07:08.280
 Find this immensely useful and very easy to use.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.660

07:18.860 --> 07:21.180
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

07:21.180 --> 07:23.300
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

07:23.300 --> 07:25.100
 that are the absolute highest quality

07:25.100 --> 07:26.840
 and have extreme versatility

07:26.840 --> 07:28.820
 in terms of what they can be used for

07:28.820 --> 07:30.100
 and when you wear them.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.200
 What do I mean by that?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.380
 Well, the company was founded

07:32.380 --> 07:34.580
 by two all American swimmers from Stanford,

07:34.580 --> 07:36.980
 and their goal was to develop eyeglasses for performance,

07:36.980 --> 07:38.920
 things like running and biking and so forth.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.220
 And you can certainly wear them for those activities.

07:41.220 --> 07:43.140
 And I do wear them for those activities.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.980
 I wear readers at night.

07:44.980 --> 07:48.060
 I also wear sunglasses sometimes when it's very bright out.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.100
 One of the things that's terrific about Roca sunglasses

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
 and eyeglasses, however,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.060
 is that they're not just designed for sport.

07:54.060 --> 07:55.660
 They have a terrific aesthetic,

07:55.660 --> 07:58.180
 and you can also wear them out to dinner,

07:58.180 --> 07:59.920
 to work and so on.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.100
 I say this because at least in my opinion,

08:02.100 --> 08:04.360
 a lot of so-called sport eyeglasses

08:04.360 --> 08:07.100
 or high-performance eyeglasses and sunglasses

08:07.100 --> 08:08.640
 make people look like cyborgs.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.180
 Roca, the aesthetic is really terrific.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.320
 They're extremely lightweight,

08:12.320 --> 08:14.400
 and they don't slip off even when you're sweaty.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.760
 So you can indeed wear them on a hot day

08:16.760 --> 08:18.200
 or when running or cycling.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.260
 They're not going to slip off your face.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.300
 They're so lightweight, in fact,

08:20.300 --> 08:22.300
 that I often forget that they're on my face.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.940
 If you'd like to try Roca sunglasses or eyeglasses,

08:24.940 --> 08:27.680

08:33.460 --> 08:35.820
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

08:35.820 --> 08:37.560
 Okay, let's talk about grief.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.420
 I just want to remind you that everybody at some point

08:41.420 --> 08:44.120
 in their life experiences grief,

08:44.120 --> 08:48.140
 either mild grief, moderate grief, or extreme grief.

08:48.140 --> 08:51.780
 And it's somewhat obvious, but worth stating nonetheless,

08:51.780 --> 08:56.340
 that how intense grief feels and how long it lasts

08:56.340 --> 08:59.340
 scales with how close we were with somebody.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.040
 And if you learn that the person who works

09:02.040 --> 09:04.100
 at the coffee shop or that you see at the coffee shop

09:04.100 --> 09:06.500
 on a regular basis happened to pass away

09:06.500 --> 09:09.140
 or tragically get killed in a car accident,

09:09.140 --> 09:10.420
 that can be quite upsetting.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.700
 It can be somewhat disorienting to you

09:12.700 --> 09:14.860
 if you, for instance, just saw them yesterday,

09:14.860 --> 09:19.060
 or they seemed perfectly fine when you saw them last.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.980
 But of course, the grief that results

09:20.980 --> 09:23.620
 from the loss of somebody to whom you have

09:23.620 --> 09:26.860
 that level of attachment is far and away different

09:26.860 --> 09:29.620
 than the level of grief that you would experience

09:29.620 --> 09:32.100
 from the death of a very close loved one,

09:32.100 --> 09:35.180
 a sibling, a parent, God forbid, a child.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.940
 When that type of loss occurs,

09:37.940 --> 09:40.380
 it's often the case that our entire relationship

09:40.380 --> 09:42.660
 to life feels different.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.780
 Places and things that at once brought us joy and laughter

09:45.780 --> 09:47.380
 now bring the opposite.

09:47.380 --> 09:51.020
 They bring us intense feelings of sadness and loss.

09:51.020 --> 09:53.260
 Psychologists and neuroscientists distinguish

09:53.260 --> 09:56.580
 between complicated grief and non-complicated grief.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.380
 They are very similar at the outset.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.500
 One of the fundamental differences between them, however,

10:01.500 --> 10:02.700
 is that complicated grief,

10:02.700 --> 10:05.500
 which occurs in about one in 10 people,

10:05.500 --> 10:08.620
 is a situation in which grief does not seem

10:08.620 --> 10:12.660
 to resolve itself even after a prolonged period of time.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.540
 Later in the episode,

10:13.540 --> 10:16.500
 I'll point you to the actual tests that are used.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.900
 I've provided links to those in the show note captions

10:19.900 --> 10:21.620
 that will allow you to distinguish

10:21.620 --> 10:23.900
 between complicated and non-complicated grief.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.140
 These arrive through the important research

10:26.140 --> 10:29.300
 of the world-class grief researchers that are out there

10:29.300 --> 10:31.620
 and the psychologists that treat grief.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.620
 The important thing to point out is that grief is a process.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.780
 Like any biological or psychological event,

10:36.780 --> 10:39.260
 it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

10:39.260 --> 10:41.180
 And I do believe that being able to orient

10:41.180 --> 10:43.540
 in terms of where you are in that process

10:43.540 --> 10:45.580
 can be immensely beneficial,

10:45.580 --> 10:48.140
 not just for predicting how long it's going to last,

10:48.140 --> 10:51.460
 but in order to conceptualize the person or animal

10:51.460 --> 10:53.260
 that you lost in a way that allows you

10:53.260 --> 10:54.780
 to best preserve their memory

10:54.780 --> 10:58.060
 while maintaining your own functional capacity in life.

10:58.060 --> 10:58.900
 Along those lines,

10:58.900 --> 11:01.900
 I want to point out that grief and depression,

11:01.900 --> 11:05.140
 while they can feel quite similar in certain ways

11:05.140 --> 11:08.300
 and have overlapping symptomology, loss of appetite,

11:08.300 --> 11:11.560
 challenges sleeping, crying in the middle of the day

11:11.560 --> 11:13.480
 for no apparent reason, et cetera,

11:13.480 --> 11:16.140
 they are distinctly different processes.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.340
 The modern research teaches us, for instance,

11:18.340 --> 11:22.620
 that grief rarely responds well to antidepressants,

11:22.620 --> 11:25.300
 whereas depression can often respond well

11:25.300 --> 11:27.380
 to antidepressants.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.300
 Everything we know and understand about grief

11:29.300 --> 11:33.580
 is that it is a distinct psychological and physiological

11:33.580 --> 11:36.300
 event in the brain and body from depression.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.300
 Rather, perhaps the best way to think about grief

11:39.300 --> 11:42.480
 is that it is actually a motivational state.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.140
 It is a yearning, it is a desire for something.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.860
 And somewhat surprisingly,

11:47.860 --> 11:51.100
 it's not just a desire to have that person back

11:51.100 --> 11:52.940
 or to have that animal back.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.620
 You might think, well, that's crazy, of course it is.

11:55.620 --> 11:58.060
 But of course, there are instances in which

11:58.060 --> 12:00.180
 someone passing away or an animal passing away

12:00.180 --> 12:03.100
 is actually providing relief for that person

12:03.100 --> 12:05.400
 because of where they happen to be in their life.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.620
 Today, I'll teach you about grief as a motivational process

12:08.620 --> 12:11.620
 because grief as a motivational process

12:11.620 --> 12:14.020
 really is the way that scientists and psychologists

12:14.020 --> 12:17.820
 now conceptualize grief and the treatments for grief

12:17.820 --> 12:20.120
 so that people can move through them effectively.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.620
 As we wade into this important topic,

12:22.620 --> 12:24.620
 I'd like to emphasize some of the common myths

12:24.620 --> 12:26.900
 and misunderstandings about grief.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.340
 Some of the myths and misunderstanding

12:28.340 --> 12:32.040
 arrived from the beautiful work of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross,

12:32.040 --> 12:33.740
 a psychologist who wrote the famous book

12:33.740 --> 12:35.380
 On Death and Dying.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.460
 And I should emphasize that while

12:37.460 --> 12:39.580
 Kubler-Ross was a real pioneer

12:39.580 --> 12:41.220
 in establishing that there are indeed

12:41.220 --> 12:43.380
 different stages of grief,

12:43.380 --> 12:45.860
 the modern science, both psychology and neuroscience,

12:45.860 --> 12:48.060
 point to the fact that not everybody experiences

12:48.060 --> 12:50.660
 all of the stages that Kubler-Ross defined,

12:50.660 --> 12:53.820
 nor do they move through those stages in a linear manner.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.820
 Sometimes they're out of sequence.

12:55.820 --> 12:57.500
 I'll just highlight the five stages

12:57.500 --> 12:59.180
 that Kubler-Ross illustrated

12:59.180 --> 13:02.220
 because some people really do experience all of them,

13:02.220 --> 13:03.820
 sometimes in the order I'll read them,

13:03.820 --> 13:06.660
 but again, oftentimes they don't.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.820
 The different stages of grief very quickly

13:08.820 --> 13:12.540
 are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.780
 In the Kubler-Ross model,

13:13.780 --> 13:15.900
 denial is always the first stage

13:15.900 --> 13:17.700
 and denial is just as it sounds,

13:17.700 --> 13:21.120
 this disbelief, it cannot be, there's no way,

13:21.120 --> 13:23.760
 a refusal to accept the new reality

13:23.760 --> 13:26.900
 that the person or animal is gone.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.740
 The second stage, anger,

13:28.740 --> 13:31.940
 is one in which the individual recognizes

13:31.940 --> 13:35.620
 that the person is indeed gone or the animal is gone,

13:35.620 --> 13:40.080
 but their body and their mind go into a motivated state.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.920
 This is important.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.780
 We're going to return to this idea of grief

13:42.780 --> 13:46.940
 as a motivated state that involves action plans

13:46.940 --> 13:48.940
 in more depth as we go further.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.540
 And then the third stage is bargaining,

13:50.540 --> 13:52.940
 what's sometimes called the negotiating phase.

13:52.940 --> 13:55.880
 This idea that, well, if I had just done this,

13:55.880 --> 13:56.940
 or if they had just done that,

13:56.940 --> 13:58.140
 or if I'd called more,

13:58.140 --> 14:02.180
 or somehow refusing to accept the reality.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.940
 So in a way, this can be blended with denial in thinking,

14:05.940 --> 14:08.040
 well, if I just don't think about it,

14:08.040 --> 14:10.140
 it won't be real, this kind of thing.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.940
 So again, stages can be blended or braided together

14:12.940 --> 14:14.740
 because emotions are complex, right?

14:14.740 --> 14:16.600
 Even though there are different stages to this process,

14:16.600 --> 14:19.460
 they can sometimes be melded together.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.820
 The fourth stage of depression that Kubler-Ross described

14:22.820 --> 14:25.780
 is one of why go on living?

14:25.780 --> 14:27.020
 Why should I go on living?

14:27.020 --> 14:30.900
 Why should I continue in this grief-stricken state

14:30.900 --> 14:33.580
 that seems to deprive me of all the richness of life

14:33.580 --> 14:36.400
 that I experienced when the person or animal was still here?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.900
 And then the fifth stage is acceptance,

14:38.900 --> 14:41.700
 this internalization, not just cognitively,

14:41.700 --> 14:43.480
 not just thinking, but emotionally,

14:43.480 --> 14:45.460
 that it's going to be okay,

14:45.460 --> 14:50.300
 that not just this too shall pass, but that it has passed.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.860
 So again, the five stages of grief that Kubler-Ross defined

14:53.860 --> 14:58.340
 were immensely important as a critical parsing

14:58.340 --> 15:01.180
 of the different stages that one could move through.

15:01.180 --> 15:03.460
 But unfortunately, those five stages were sort of taken

15:03.460 --> 15:05.300
 to be gospel for a long time.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.020
 And we now know based on neuroimaging,

15:08.020 --> 15:10.620
 based on more in-depth psychological evaluation,

15:10.620 --> 15:13.520
 and frankly, more researchers and clinicians

15:13.520 --> 15:15.460
 moving into this area and observing

15:15.460 --> 15:18.340
 that while much of what Kubler-Ross described

15:18.340 --> 15:21.020
 does hold true, it's not always the case.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.700
 And in fact, the contour of the grief process

15:23.700 --> 15:25.180
 actually has a lot of dimensions

15:25.180 --> 15:27.960
 that are not encapsulated by those five stages.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.260
 There's also a lot of variation

15:29.260 --> 15:32.140
 depending on whether or not the loss is due to old age,

15:32.140 --> 15:35.300
 disease, whether or not there was suffering prior or not,

15:35.300 --> 15:38.560
 suicide or non-suicide types, deaths and losses,

15:38.560 --> 15:42.600
 and even grief about non-death losses,

15:42.600 --> 15:45.380
 a relationship breakup or something of that sort,

15:45.380 --> 15:48.100
 or even homesickness and things of that sort.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.900
 So I do want to tip our hats to the incredible work

15:51.900 --> 15:53.660
 of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.020
 By no means am I or do other researchers

15:56.020 --> 15:58.620
 try and discount her incredible contributions,

15:58.620 --> 16:00.940
 but I think nowadays we have a different

16:00.940 --> 16:02.880
 and frankly, a better understanding

16:02.880 --> 16:04.760
 of what the grief process is like,

16:04.760 --> 16:08.140
 and as a consequence, better tools to move through grief.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.540
 In order to really understand what grief is

16:10.540 --> 16:14.300
 in your brain and body and how to best navigate grief,

16:14.300 --> 16:16.940
 I'd like you to do an experiment with me.

16:16.940 --> 16:19.060
 For the next five minutes or so,

16:19.060 --> 16:21.780
 I'd like you to at least try to discard

16:21.780 --> 16:26.780
 of all prior notions of grief as just a state of sadness.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.940
 I want to acknowledge that it is and does involve sadness,

16:30.940 --> 16:34.040
 but for right now, let's think about grief

16:34.040 --> 16:38.820
 as a motivational state, as a desire for something specific.

16:38.820 --> 16:41.500
 In fact, I'd like you to think about grief

16:41.500 --> 16:44.660
 as an attempt to reach out and get something

16:44.660 --> 16:46.340
 that you very much want.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.220
 Imagine yourself extremely thirsty, for instance,

16:49.220 --> 16:50.940
 on a very hot day,

16:50.940 --> 16:54.140
 and a glass of water is right in front of you,

16:54.140 --> 16:56.780
 and it's a beautiful clean glass of water,

16:56.780 --> 16:58.520
 and it's completely full,

16:58.520 --> 17:01.680
 and you so badly want to drink that water,

17:01.680 --> 17:05.460
 but no matter how intensely you want it,

17:05.460 --> 17:07.780
 and no matter how hard you try and reach it,

17:07.780 --> 17:11.200
 it always shifts just outside your reach.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.780
 So if you can imagine that, even just a little bit,

17:14.780 --> 17:17.700
 you are touching into the experience of grief.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.060
 How do I know this?

17:19.060 --> 17:22.540
 Well, I know this because brain imaging studies

17:22.540 --> 17:24.800
 involving what's called functional magnetic resonance

17:24.800 --> 17:27.940
 imaging, fMRI, in which you can evaluate

17:27.940 --> 17:30.100
 which brain areas are more active than others

17:30.100 --> 17:31.280
 according to blood flow,

17:31.280 --> 17:33.880
 which correlates with neural activity and so forth,

17:33.880 --> 17:37.220
 teaches us that the brain areas that are associated

17:37.220 --> 17:40.420
 with motivation and craving and pursuit

17:40.420 --> 17:43.300
 are some of the primary brain areas and circuits

17:43.300 --> 17:46.460
 that are activated in states of grief.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.120
 I'd like to share an important paper with you.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.060
 It's one of the first to illustrate the fact

17:50.060 --> 17:54.820
 that grief is not just a state of sadness and pain.

17:54.820 --> 17:58.340
 It is indeed a state of yearning and desire

17:58.340 --> 18:01.180
 of something that is just outside your reach

18:01.180 --> 18:04.460
 and unfortunately will always be just outside your reach

18:04.460 --> 18:08.780
 until you remap your relationship to that person or thing.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.660
 The title of this paper is posed first as a question,

18:11.660 --> 18:13.200
 so that's why I'll read it as such.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.180
 The title is Craving Love.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.940
 Enduring Grief Activates Brain's Reward Center.

18:17.940 --> 18:20.580
 And the first author of this paper is Mary Frances O'Connor.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.440
 She's a professor of psychology

18:22.440 --> 18:26.520
 at the University of Arizona and one of the world leaders

18:26.520 --> 18:30.020
 in the study of grief from a neuroscience perspective.

18:30.020 --> 18:31.180
 With some luck, we'll get her here

18:31.180 --> 18:32.620
 on the podcast as a guest.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.900
 Now, this paper has several important features.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.220
 I'll just highlight a few.

18:37.220 --> 18:39.980
 One of the features of this paper that's not surprising

18:39.980 --> 18:42.820
 is they found that people who are in a state of grief

18:42.820 --> 18:43.980
 are in a state of pain.

18:43.980 --> 18:47.060
 That is, brain areas associated with pain,

18:47.060 --> 18:50.660
 actual physical pain, are more active

18:50.660 --> 18:53.740
 than in non-grieving individuals.

18:53.740 --> 18:56.240
 However, they also found that people who are experiencing

18:56.240 --> 18:59.920
 what's called complicated grief showed reward-related

18:59.920 --> 19:02.820
 activity in a brain area called the nucleus accumbens.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.300
 What is reward-related activity?

19:04.300 --> 19:08.140
 Reward-related activity is activity of neurons

19:08.140 --> 19:11.220
 that's associated with motivational states.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.780
 And the nucleus accumbens is a brain center

19:13.780 --> 19:16.160
 in which dopamine has the effect

19:16.160 --> 19:18.700
 of creating a motivated state.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.140
 If ever you thought that dopamine was only associated

19:22.140 --> 19:24.640
 with feeling good, you hear about dopamine hits,

19:24.640 --> 19:28.260
 well, this paper and papers like it

19:28.260 --> 19:32.000
 firmly tell us that dopamine is not about feeling good.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.500
 Dopamine is about placing us into a state

19:34.500 --> 19:37.540
 of desiring things and seeking things.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.280
 This is true in addiction.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.000
 This is true when we're hungry and we want to eat.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.620
 This is true when we want to reproduce.

19:45.620 --> 19:48.580
 This is true in every state in which we are reaching

19:48.580 --> 19:51.380
 for something outside our immediate ability

19:51.380 --> 19:53.220
 to give that thing to ourselves.

19:53.220 --> 19:55.380
 This is very important to understand

19:55.380 --> 19:56.740
 if you want to understand grief

19:56.740 --> 19:58.460
 and how to move through grief.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.660
 Grief is not just about sadness.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.220
 It is a state of sadness,

20:03.220 --> 20:06.340
 hence the activation of brain areas associated with pain.

20:06.340 --> 20:11.340
 And it is a state of desire and reaching for something.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.660
 And for those of you that have experienced grief,

20:14.660 --> 20:16.460
 I think that will resonate with you.

20:17.300 --> 20:22.300
 In that understanding that grief is both a state of pain,

20:22.820 --> 20:26.040
 but also a state of wanting,

20:26.040 --> 20:30.220
 and in the understanding that when we lose somebody,

20:30.220 --> 20:32.960
 either because of breakup or because of death,

20:32.960 --> 20:37.960
 or if an animal dies or gets taken away or is missing,

20:40.240 --> 20:42.200
 that state of wanting and desire

20:42.200 --> 20:45.160
 drives an activation state within us.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.840
 Now, the key thing to understand is that the activation

20:47.840 --> 20:50.520
 of those reward centers and the involvement of dopamine

20:51.440 --> 20:54.400
 puts us into an anticipatory state,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.880
 a state of waiting for something to happen.

20:56.880 --> 21:01.200
 It also puts us into a state of action or desiring action.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.240
 Our body and our mind are what I like to refer to

21:04.240 --> 21:06.020
 as center of mass forward.

21:06.020 --> 21:09.480
 We are seeking how to resolve the craving,

21:09.480 --> 21:11.600
 even if we know that is impossible.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.400
 Why do I say that?

21:13.400 --> 21:16.720
 Well, we understand also on the basis

21:16.720 --> 21:20.480
 of brain imaging studies and also some studies in animals

21:20.480 --> 21:22.240
 that I'll describe in a moment,

21:22.240 --> 21:24.900
 that in order to understand grief,

21:24.900 --> 21:26.800
 we have to understand how attachments

21:26.800 --> 21:28.360
 are represented in our brain.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.040
 And it turns out that both attachments

21:31.040 --> 21:33.880
 and the breaking of attachments in healthy ways

21:33.880 --> 21:37.460
 are governed by three important what we call dimensions.

21:37.460 --> 21:40.600
 A dimension is just some feature of the world

21:40.600 --> 21:42.840
 that's represented in our brain.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.680
 So for instance, the color red doesn't exist in your brain.

21:46.680 --> 21:51.680
 You happen to have cells, neurons in your eye

21:51.680 --> 21:55.620
 that respond best to long wavelengths of light.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.400
 And those long wavelengths of light happen to be

21:58.400 --> 22:02.320
 what are reflected off things that are perceived as red.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.840
 So in your mind, you have a notion of red.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.280
 I know this is a little bit abstract,

22:06.280 --> 22:09.760
 but you're not actually lighting up red neurons

22:09.760 --> 22:12.040
 in your brain and that's why you see red.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.280
 You are lighting up neurons in your brain

22:14.280 --> 22:17.740
 that represent the presence of red things

22:17.740 --> 22:19.280
 in your environment.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.880
 Similarly, we have neurons and maps,

22:22.880 --> 22:25.800
 or we say representations of other dimensions.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.920
 We have dimensions of touch.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.580
 We have dimensions of sound.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.280
 And as I'll now teach you,

22:30.280 --> 22:34.360
 we have three dimensions that define our relationship

22:34.360 --> 22:36.920
 to people and animals and things.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.440
 And when those people, animals and things

22:39.440 --> 22:42.120
 are within our immediate vicinity,

22:42.120 --> 22:45.720
 or if we know how we could access them, right?

22:45.720 --> 22:46.660
 If somebody is still alive,

22:46.660 --> 22:50.040
 there's generally some way to access them

22:50.040 --> 22:53.120
 unless they're refusing to interact with us.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.420
 Well, when we understand that,

22:55.420 --> 22:59.400
 our motivational states can operate in a way that's logical.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.440
 We know that for instance,

23:00.440 --> 23:04.200
 if we want to find our mother, brother, sister,

23:04.200 --> 23:07.520
 significant other, dog, cat, parrot, et cetera,

23:07.520 --> 23:10.380
 we have to go through a certain set of steps.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.880
 What are those three dimensions and how do they work?

23:12.880 --> 23:14.560
 And that's what I'm going to teach you now.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.880
 So at risk of sounding a little bit too reductionist,

23:16.880 --> 23:20.540
 we are now going to describe your relationship

23:20.540 --> 23:23.000
 to anything, everything,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.900
 and anyone in these three dimensions.

23:26.860 --> 23:28.440
 How can we do that?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.740
 Why would we even want to do that?

23:30.740 --> 23:34.800
 Why would we want to rob the complexity of relationships

23:34.800 --> 23:37.400
 of their contour and their detail?

23:37.400 --> 23:41.120
 Well, if we can understand the dimensions

23:41.120 --> 23:44.460
 in which we map our relationship to people,

23:44.460 --> 23:46.400
 animals and things,

23:46.400 --> 23:49.080
 then we can understand why it is

23:49.080 --> 23:52.720
 that when those people, animals or things

23:52.720 --> 23:57.280
 are not accessible to us, why it hurts so much

23:57.280 --> 23:59.540
 and why it takes a certain amount of time

23:59.540 --> 24:02.760
 in order to re-understand, if you will,

24:02.760 --> 24:05.920
 or remap our association to them.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.360
 I promise that in grasping the information

24:08.360 --> 24:10.080
 I'm about to give you,

24:10.080 --> 24:14.060
 you will be able to better orient in the grief process

24:14.060 --> 24:17.420
 and you'll be able to move through it more effectively.

24:17.420 --> 24:21.600
 The three dimensions of relating to someone

24:21.600 --> 24:26.600
 or an animal or a thing are space, time and closeness.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.240
 And in order to illustrate each one

24:29.240 --> 24:32.820
 and how they work together to support relationships

24:32.820 --> 24:35.160
 and their involvement in the grieving process,

24:35.160 --> 24:37.720
 I'm going to tell you about an experiment.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.080
 This experiment was actually done.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.080
 The experiment involves putting people into a brain scanner

24:43.080 --> 24:46.720
 that allows the researcher to evaluate brain activity

24:46.720 --> 24:47.560
 in different areas.

24:47.560 --> 24:51.040
 In fact, can look in a very non-biased way,

24:51.040 --> 24:52.880
 not make any predictions about which brain areas

24:52.880 --> 24:54.520
 are going to be involved.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.000
 And the experiment is the following.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.300
 The person, I should say the research subject,

25:00.300 --> 25:03.380
 first sees images of things that reside

25:03.380 --> 25:05.000
 at different distances from one another.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.600
 And when I say things, these are objects.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.700
 So in one case, it's a beach or a parking lot

25:11.700 --> 25:14.040
 with bowling balls set at different distances

25:14.040 --> 25:14.920
 from one another.

25:16.300 --> 25:20.240
 Their brain is imaged and as their brain is imaged,

25:20.240 --> 25:23.360
 they see different pictures of different scenes,

25:23.360 --> 25:25.400
 the beach, the parking lot, et cetera,

25:25.400 --> 25:27.680
 bowling balls spaced in different ways,

25:27.680 --> 25:30.000
 close together, far apart, regularly spaced,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.160
 non-regularly spaced.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.460
 When one does this sort of experiment,

25:33.460 --> 25:35.760
 you see a lot of brain areas activated,

25:35.760 --> 25:37.480
 not surprisingly the visual cortex,

25:37.480 --> 25:39.040
 the area of the brain that is responsible

25:39.040 --> 25:41.840
 for creating visual perceptions,

25:41.840 --> 25:46.060
 but also a brain area that seems uniquely tuned

25:46.060 --> 25:50.380
 to the distance between you and the objects.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.340
 So whether or not the bowling balls are far away

25:52.340 --> 25:54.840
 or close together from one another,

25:54.840 --> 25:56.640
 and whether or not they are far away

25:56.640 --> 25:58.200
 or close to you physically.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.960
 So literally the distance between you and these objects,

26:00.960 --> 26:03.640
 we'll refer to that measure, that dimension,

26:03.640 --> 26:05.880
 as we call it as proximity, okay?

26:05.880 --> 26:08.560
 Whether or not it's very close to you,

26:08.560 --> 26:12.720
 high degree of proximity or far away, low proximity,

26:12.720 --> 26:14.540
 but it's simply physical space.

26:14.540 --> 26:19.220
 Then subjects listen to tones.

26:19.220 --> 26:22.020
 Those tones also are spaced from one another.

26:22.020 --> 26:26.100
 So it could be something as simple as my hand meeting

26:26.100 --> 26:28.740
 the table top that I'm happen to be sitting in front of.

26:28.740 --> 26:29.580
 So it's,

26:32.960 --> 26:34.360
 they image the brain.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.220
 Of course, areas of the brain they're associated

26:36.220 --> 26:40.140
 with auditory perception are active, not surprisingly,

26:40.140 --> 26:42.620
 but as they evaluate different types of sounds

26:42.620 --> 26:44.960
 and patterns of sounds, for instance,

26:49.020 --> 26:52.700
 they can start to parse brain areas that seem uniquely tuned

26:52.700 --> 26:55.580
 to the spacing of sounds independent

26:55.580 --> 26:56.700
 of what sounds are coming in.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.920
 So whether or not it's musical notes

26:57.920 --> 27:01.140
 or my hand hitting the table or human speech,

27:01.140 --> 27:05.500
 they identified a brain region that is uniquely tuned.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.820
 That is, it becomes active specifically in response

27:08.820 --> 27:11.820
 to changes in the spacing between sounds,

27:11.820 --> 27:14.420
 much in the same way as they could identify brain regions

27:14.420 --> 27:16.980
 that were only activated when there were changes

27:16.980 --> 27:18.920
 in the distance between objects,

27:18.920 --> 27:20.460
 such as the bowling balls that I used

27:20.460 --> 27:22.300
 in the previous example.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.860
 And then the subjects saw a different set of images.

27:25.860 --> 27:29.660
 The images that they saw were of people and of faces.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.660
 And some of the images that they saw were

27:31.660 --> 27:33.880
 of people's faces right up close.

27:33.880 --> 27:37.540
 And other images were of people at a distance

27:37.540 --> 27:39.900
 where you could see the whole body of the person.

27:39.900 --> 27:43.420
 Now, they also varied the emotional relationship

27:43.420 --> 27:44.280
 to those people.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.860
 That is, they were able to get photographs

27:46.860 --> 27:49.140
 from these research subjects lives.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.140
 So they could show them pictures of, for instance,

27:51.140 --> 27:55.080
 their sister or some random person off the street.

27:55.080 --> 27:59.980
 They could show them pictures of a parent or of a neighbor

27:59.980 --> 28:02.880
 or of a celebrity that's well-known

28:02.880 --> 28:05.500
 or of somebody that they didn't know at all.

28:05.500 --> 28:09.100
 So they were able to vary both the position of the person,

28:09.100 --> 28:10.820
 close or far.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.820
 And they were able to vary the emotional distance

28:13.820 --> 28:15.860
 to the person, which is this dimension

28:15.860 --> 28:17.520
 that I'm referring to as closeness,

28:17.520 --> 28:18.980
 which is not physical closeness,

28:18.980 --> 28:22.580
 but how attached or how well you know somebody.

28:22.580 --> 28:24.180
 Now, this is maybe sounding

28:24.180 --> 28:25.680
 like a somewhat complicated experiment,

28:25.680 --> 28:29.740
 but the takeaway from this experiment is exquisitely simple

28:29.740 --> 28:32.260
 and exquisitely important.

28:32.260 --> 28:36.880
 The result was that in all three conditions,

28:36.880 --> 28:41.840
 changes in the physical spacing of these objects,

28:41.840 --> 28:44.400
 changes in the temporal,

28:44.400 --> 28:46.600
 that is the time spacing of these sounds

28:46.600 --> 28:49.480
 and changes in the emotional distance

28:49.480 --> 28:51.840
 between the subject and different people,

28:51.840 --> 28:56.080
 the same brain area was uniquely activated.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.360
 Now, that is an incredible thing to find

28:58.360 --> 29:01.740
 because what it suggests is that, yes, of course,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.160
 there are brain areas that are associated

29:03.160 --> 29:05.120
 with representation of visual objects.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.440
 And that, yes, of course, there are brain areas associated

29:07.440 --> 29:09.960
 with representation of different sounds.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.180
 And of course, there are brain areas associated with faces.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.320
 We now know this.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.560
 In fact, there's something called the fusiform face area,

29:15.560 --> 29:18.120
 which is uniquely tuned to faces.

29:18.120 --> 29:23.040
 But at the same time, there is a unique brain region

29:23.040 --> 29:28.040
 that is activated in all three of the conditions I described

29:28.220 --> 29:31.120
 that has to do with how far you are from somebody,

29:31.120 --> 29:36.120
 both in space, in time, and in terms of emotional closeness.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.360
 And that brain area, it turns out,

29:39.360 --> 29:43.200
 is a brain area called the inferior parietal lobule.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.540
 The inferior parietal lobule.

29:44.540 --> 29:45.960
 Now, you don't need to know

29:45.960 --> 29:48.540
 where the inferior parietal lobule is.

29:48.540 --> 29:49.680
 In fact, you don't even need to know

29:49.680 --> 29:51.500
 the name of this brain area.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.960
 What you do need to know, however,

29:52.960 --> 29:54.360
 if you want to understand grief

29:54.360 --> 29:56.000
 and how to move through grief,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.880
 is that your map of people is not a map

29:59.880 --> 30:02.840
 of emotional closeness per se.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.420
 It is a map of emotional closeness,

30:05.420 --> 30:08.840
 what we call attachment, that is interwoven,

30:08.840 --> 30:12.340
 that is braided in in a very intimate way

30:12.340 --> 30:16.140
 with your map of where they are in physical space

30:16.140 --> 30:18.320
 and where they are in time,

30:18.320 --> 30:19.400
 when you saw them last,

30:19.400 --> 30:21.280
 when you're likely to see them again,

30:21.280 --> 30:24.840
 and if you were to want to see them,

30:24.840 --> 30:26.960
 how much time it would take to reach them

30:26.960 --> 30:28.840
 or for them to reach you.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.160
 Now, earlier I said that one of the key functions

30:31.160 --> 30:34.560
 of our nervous system is to be able to make predictions.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.980
 And so it's somewhat obvious,

30:36.980 --> 30:40.000
 but nonetheless important to state and restate

30:40.000 --> 30:42.280
 that one of the most powerful aspects

30:42.280 --> 30:46.100
 of our attachments to people, animals and things,

30:46.100 --> 30:48.160
 is our ability to predict

30:48.160 --> 30:49.640
 what it would take to see them again

30:49.640 --> 30:52.340
 and when we are going to see them again.

30:52.340 --> 30:57.340
 In fact, we could say that our ability to locate someone

30:57.340 --> 31:01.940
 or an animal or thing in space and time, right?

31:01.940 --> 31:04.100
 Where they are and how long it would take

31:04.100 --> 31:06.220
 for us to reach them or them to reach us

31:07.060 --> 31:10.160
 is a prediction of the requirements

31:10.160 --> 31:11.920
 to engage in the attachment.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.160
 In order to illustrate this at a little bit more depth,

31:15.160 --> 31:17.780
 let's just do a fill in the blank experiment.

31:17.780 --> 31:19.660
 You can do this now in real time.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.900
 I want you to think of somebody that you either rely on

31:22.900 --> 31:25.760
 or that you care about very, very much.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.380
 And I'll just allow you to fill in the blank

31:28.380 --> 31:29.420
 on this sentence.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.940
 If I want to see blank, the person or animal,

31:35.220 --> 31:38.920
 I could see them within blank amount of time, right?

31:38.920 --> 31:41.880
 If right now you wanted to see this person or animal

31:41.880 --> 31:43.660
 or maybe even a thing,

31:43.660 --> 31:46.440
 how long would it take you to reach them?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.940
 Could be a day, could be a second,

31:48.940 --> 31:50.120
 could be there right next to you.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.060
 All you'd have to do is turn your head.

31:52.060 --> 31:54.560
 Now answer this.

31:55.780 --> 32:00.780
 If this person were to travel halfway around the world

32:02.020 --> 32:04.480
 and land in their plane,

32:04.480 --> 32:06.240
 I would expect to hear from them

32:06.240 --> 32:10.680
 within blank minutes of them landing, okay?

32:10.680 --> 32:13.720
 The answers of this of course will differ.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.420
 Now I'd like you to answer this question.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.240
 If I'd like to find myself,

32:18.240 --> 32:21.420
 it would take me X amount of time.

32:21.420 --> 32:23.540
 And of course, if you're listening to this

32:23.540 --> 32:26.600
 and you're understanding it and you're of a rational mind,

32:26.600 --> 32:29.840
 the answer to that should be zero seconds, instantaneous.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.800
 You are always able to locate yourself in space and time,

32:32.800 --> 32:35.640
 provided you are in the appropriate state of mind,

32:35.640 --> 32:37.580
 meaning not to sleep for instance.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.160
 That last question might seem somewhat silly,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.720
 but it's a fundamentally important one

32:43.720 --> 32:45.240
 because it illustrates the extremes

32:45.240 --> 32:47.360
 at which we map our relationship to ourselves

32:47.360 --> 32:49.800
 relative to other people and things.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.700
 Now, if all of this sounds like a bunch of neuro psycho

32:54.820 --> 32:57.640
 babble parsing of the obvious,

32:57.640 --> 33:00.600
 I'd encourage you to suspend that belief for the moment.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.080
 Because if you understand that all relationships

33:03.080 --> 33:04.680
 are mapped in the brain and body

33:04.680 --> 33:06.040
 through these three dimensions,

33:06.040 --> 33:11.000
 space, time and closeness or proximity of space,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.040
 proximity in time and proximity of attachment,

33:15.040 --> 33:20.040
 how close or rich or bonded you are to someone.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.760
 Well, if you can understand that,

33:22.760 --> 33:25.480
 then it almost becomes obvious,

33:25.480 --> 33:28.560
 or at least it becomes intuitive as to why

33:28.560 --> 33:31.040
 after the loss of somebody in particular a death

33:31.040 --> 33:35.840
 or the loss of an animal, this map has to be reordered.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.680
 Why?

33:36.680 --> 33:40.880
 Because if we are attached to someone or an animal

33:40.880 --> 33:42.640
 at a deep level,

33:42.640 --> 33:45.720
 it is almost always on the basis of a lot

33:45.720 --> 33:47.760
 of what we call episodic experience.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.300
 A lot of episodic memories,

33:49.300 --> 33:51.340
 memories of things that happened.

33:51.340 --> 33:55.720
 Episodic memories are literally the conscious recollection

33:55.720 --> 33:59.920
 of your experience of somebody or an animal or a thing.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.520
 And within that memory,

34:02.520 --> 34:06.600
 you have an understanding of what has happened with them

34:06.600 --> 34:09.560
 in association to you, what's going on with them,

34:09.560 --> 34:11.860
 where it happened, when it happened.

34:11.860 --> 34:14.140
 You have a rich knowledge database

34:14.140 --> 34:16.120
 that we call implicit knowledge, right?

34:16.120 --> 34:17.760
 You might not be aware of it all the time,

34:17.760 --> 34:20.280
 but it's within you of what this person is like

34:20.280 --> 34:23.000
 and what they're doing in their life.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.020
 When somebody is taken away from us for whatever reason,

34:27.460 --> 34:30.920
 episodic memories persist for some period of time,

34:30.920 --> 34:34.440
 and they are still linked to our feelings of attachment.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.840
 Grief is the process of uncoupling,

34:37.840 --> 34:41.980
 unbraiding and untangling that relationship

34:41.980 --> 34:44.400
 between where people are in space, in time,

34:44.400 --> 34:46.000
 and our attachment to them.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.500
 What I mean by this is when somebody or an animal

34:48.500 --> 34:50.080
 or a thing is taken from us,

34:50.080 --> 34:55.000
 either by decision or by death or by circumstance,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.540
 well, in that case,

34:57.540 --> 35:02.100
 our entire memory bank and our ability to predict

35:02.100 --> 35:03.920
 where and when they will be,

35:03.920 --> 35:08.440
 and therefore when we can feed our attachment to them again,

35:08.440 --> 35:11.760
 that whole map is obliterated,

35:11.760 --> 35:16.240
 except that the attachment itself has not been disrupted.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.600
 Assuming that you are deeply attached to someone

35:18.600 --> 35:21.600
 or an animal or a thing, that attachment persists,

35:21.600 --> 35:24.840
 and the grief process is one in which you have to reorder

35:24.840 --> 35:28.300
 your understanding of them in space and in time.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.360
 This is very, very hard to do.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.600
 And for some people, it's almost impossible to do,

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
 at least at the outset of grief.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.680
 This, in a very neurosciency way,

35:38.680 --> 35:42.040
 explains this stage that Kubler-Ross described,

35:42.040 --> 35:44.760
 which many, again, not all, but many people experience,

35:44.760 --> 35:46.560
 which is one of denial.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.600
 How could it be?

35:47.600 --> 35:48.440
 Why?

35:48.440 --> 35:52.440
 Well, when we have a rich catalog of experiences

35:52.440 --> 35:54.400
 with somebody or of them,

35:54.400 --> 35:55.860
 ideas about them and what they do,

35:55.860 --> 35:57.620
 how they spend their day, what they do and don't do,

35:57.620 --> 35:59.300
 where they do it, et cetera,

35:59.300 --> 36:03.760
 well, that memory bank is not just flushed out

36:03.760 --> 36:07.560
 the moment that we learn that they're no longer with us.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.960
 What happens is the brain continues to make

36:09.960 --> 36:13.120
 these predictions that they will be in a certain place

36:13.120 --> 36:14.720
 or a certain time, right?

36:14.720 --> 36:15.960
 That there'll be in a certain time zone

36:15.960 --> 36:17.900
 or they'll walk in the door any moment.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.480
 All of those predictions still hold.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.040
 The neural activity continues.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.980
 We call this reverberatory activity.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.640
 That explains the yearning for and the desire to interact,

36:27.640 --> 36:29.160
 and yet it's just beyond our reach

36:29.160 --> 36:31.220
 because once they're gone,

36:31.220 --> 36:34.000
 our brain still functions in a way,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.380
 these neural circuits still function in a way

36:36.380 --> 36:39.160
 that put us into an action state of seeking them,

36:39.160 --> 36:41.460
 looking for them in the same location,

36:41.460 --> 36:44.060
 expecting them to contact us at whatever frequency

36:44.060 --> 36:45.840
 that we were used to hearing from them

36:45.840 --> 36:47.020
 or that we could reach out to them

36:47.020 --> 36:48.920
 and reliably get a response.

36:50.660 --> 36:53.840
 It is immensely disorienting, in other words,

36:53.840 --> 36:55.840
 to maintain a close attachment

36:55.840 --> 37:00.600
 and at the same time to not be able to make predictions

37:00.600 --> 37:05.600
 about where that person and more thing is in space and time.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.040
 Now, if this seems somewhat abstract,

37:08.040 --> 37:09.880
 I'm going to continue to flesh it out.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.160
 And actually right now,

37:11.160 --> 37:13.400
 I'd like to flesh it out with a real world example

37:13.400 --> 37:16.040
 of grief and loss that comes to us

37:16.040 --> 37:19.960
 from perhaps one of the greatest minds in human history

37:19.960 --> 37:24.960
 and somebody who was intensely grounded in reality and logic

37:24.960 --> 37:27.320
 and indeed the physics of the world.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.320
 And the person I'm referring to is none other

37:29.320 --> 37:33.200
 than the Nobel prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.480
 Many of you are probably familiar with Richard Feynman.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.960
 Some of you perhaps are not.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.780
 Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize winning physicist

37:39.780 --> 37:42.440
 known for his thick New York accent.

37:42.440 --> 37:45.160
 He was actually not from Brooklyn, as many people think.

37:45.160 --> 37:49.000
 He was actually from Far Rockaway in Long Island.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
 Thick New York accent, very personable, exceptional teacher,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.280
 brilliant mind, hence the Nobel prize in physics.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.680
 Also a quite funny and amusing person,

37:59.680 --> 38:01.600
 told great anecdotes, et cetera.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.780
 Feynman had a childhood sweetheart

38:05.780 --> 38:07.940
 who turned out to be his first wife.

38:07.940 --> 38:09.420
 Her name was Arlene.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.140
 And it was well known that Feynman

38:11.140 --> 38:14.260
 was absolutely in love with her.

38:14.260 --> 38:15.860
 He would talk about her all the time.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.600
 She had a profound influence on him and his thinking

38:18.600 --> 38:21.700
 and ultimately on his public education efforts later.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.300
 If you haven't already read books such as

38:24.300 --> 38:26.220
 surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman,

38:26.220 --> 38:28.580
 or what do you care what other people think,

38:28.580 --> 38:29.540
 I encourage you to do so.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.380
 And in fact, that quote,

38:30.380 --> 38:32.100
 what do you care what other people think

38:32.100 --> 38:34.400
 is actually a quote, not a Feynman,

38:34.400 --> 38:36.060
 but of his first wife, Arlene,

38:36.060 --> 38:39.800
 who sadly died at a very young age from tuberculosis.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.380
 Why am I sharing Feynman's story

38:42.380 --> 38:44.180
 of loss of his first bride?

38:44.180 --> 38:49.160
 Well, the reason is Feynman continued to write letters

38:49.160 --> 38:50.940
 to Arlene for a long period of time.

38:50.940 --> 38:54.680
 This is well known only because after Feynman died,

38:56.300 --> 38:59.560
 it was discovered that he kept an archive of letters

38:59.560 --> 39:02.880
 to his deceased first wife.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.620
 And even though he did eventually marry

39:05.620 --> 39:08.300
 and in fact had many relationships with many people,

39:08.300 --> 39:09.680
 and I think was married twice more,

39:09.680 --> 39:12.340
 maybe it was once, maybe it was twice,

39:12.340 --> 39:14.380
 the intensity of his grief,

39:14.380 --> 39:19.380
 but also his lack of ability to transition his mind

39:19.380 --> 39:23.620
 to a place where he understood that Arlene had died

39:23.620 --> 39:26.140
 is one of the more profound examples

39:26.140 --> 39:29.660
 of this inability to reconcile the logical world

39:29.660 --> 39:31.240
 and the emotional world.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.280
 And I'm now going to read to you a letter

39:34.280 --> 39:35.900
 that Feynman wrote to Arlene.

39:35.900 --> 39:37.900
 This was discovered after Feynman's death

39:37.900 --> 39:41.020
 when they went through his desk and his belongings.

39:41.020 --> 39:43.180
 And as I read this,

39:43.180 --> 39:45.940
 you're going to hear some of the typical narrative of grief

39:45.940 --> 39:50.940
 that is not unique to Feynman and his dead wife.

39:50.940 --> 39:53.360
 But there are also some elements in there

39:53.360 --> 39:57.700
 that I think you'll recognize as highlighting this disbelief

39:57.700 --> 40:00.500
 and this dissociation between the reality

40:00.500 --> 40:03.060
 of somebody's location in space and time

40:03.060 --> 40:05.700
 and the emotional attachment that they hold for us.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.420
 And therein lies the information

40:07.420 --> 40:09.540
 about how to better navigate grief.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.860
 So now I'm reading from the letter.

40:10.860 --> 40:14.740
 This was a letter dated October 17th, 1946.

40:14.740 --> 40:17.860
 It's not terribly long, but bear with me.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.980
 Dear Arlene, I adore you, sweetheart.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.600
 I know how much you like to hear that,

40:23.600 --> 40:26.060
 but I don't only write it because you like it.

40:26.060 --> 40:28.460
 I write it because it makes me warm all over inside

40:28.460 --> 40:30.200
 to write it to you.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.700
 It is such a terribly long time

40:31.700 --> 40:34.580
 since I last wrote to you, almost two years.

40:34.580 --> 40:35.660
 But I know you'll excuse me

40:35.660 --> 40:38.860
 because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic.

40:38.860 --> 40:41.900
 And I thought there was no sense to writing.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.240
 But now I know, my darling wife,

40:43.240 --> 40:45.900
 that it is the right thing to do what I've delayed in doing

40:45.900 --> 40:48.260
 and that I have done so much in the past.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.040
 I wanted to tell you I love you.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.300
 I want to love you.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.980
 I will always love you.

40:52.980 --> 40:55.780
 So here we can hear the intense emotional attachment

40:55.780 --> 40:57.260
 that clearly has persisted.

40:59.340 --> 41:00.940
 I find it hard to understand in my mind

41:00.940 --> 41:03.500
 what it means to love you after you are dead.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.940
 But I still want to comfort and take care of you.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.740
 And I want you to love me and care for me.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.780
 I want to have problems to discuss with you.

41:10.780 --> 41:12.860
 I want to do little projects with you.

41:12.860 --> 41:15.680
 I never thought until just now that we can do that.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.380
 What should we do?

41:17.380 --> 41:19.400
 We started to learn to make clothes together

41:19.400 --> 41:22.540
 or learn Chinese or getting a movie projector.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.040
 Can't I do something now?

41:24.040 --> 41:26.340
 No, I am alone without you.

41:26.340 --> 41:29.400
 And you were the idea woman and the general instigator

41:29.400 --> 41:31.080
 of all our wild adventures.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.380
 When you were sick, you worried

41:33.380 --> 41:35.980
 because you could not give me something that you wanted.

41:35.980 --> 41:38.020
 And you thought I needed.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.420
 You needn't have worried.

41:39.420 --> 41:41.420
 Just as I told you then there was no real need

41:41.420 --> 41:43.940
 because I loved you in so many ways so much.

41:43.940 --> 41:46.260
 And now it is clearly even more true.

41:46.260 --> 41:47.940
 You can give me nothing now,

41:47.940 --> 41:49.940
 yet I love you so that you stand in the way

41:49.940 --> 41:51.780
 of my loving anything else.

41:51.780 --> 41:53.320
 But I wanted you to stand there.

41:53.320 --> 41:57.800
 You dead are so much better than anyone else alive.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.740
 So you can really appreciate the depth

42:00.740 --> 42:02.320
 and intensity of the attachment.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.660
 Despite two years time, it clearly has not waned.

42:06.540 --> 42:08.180
 I'll read the final paragraph now.

42:08.180 --> 42:11.540
 I know you will assure me that I am foolish

42:11.540 --> 42:13.580
 and that you want me to have full happiness

42:13.580 --> 42:15.520
 and don't want to be in my way.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.980
 I bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend

42:17.980 --> 42:20.660
 except you sweetheart after two years.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.640
 But you can't help it darling, nor can I.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.140
 I don't understand it for I've met many girls

42:25.140 --> 42:28.380
 and very nice ones and I don't want to remain alone.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.980
 But in two or three meetings, they all seem ashes.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.920
 You only are left to me.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.440
 You are real.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.580
 My darling wife, I do adore you.

42:37.580 --> 42:39.080
 I love my wife.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.780
 My wife is dead.

42:40.780 --> 42:42.300
 Rich.

42:42.300 --> 42:45.020
 P.S., please excuse my not mailing this,

42:45.020 --> 42:46.720
 but I don't know your new address.

42:48.580 --> 42:51.140
 So there's a lot contained in this letter.

42:51.140 --> 42:53.300
 We could parse it line by line,

42:53.300 --> 42:54.820
 but I think it's fair to say that clearly

42:54.820 --> 42:57.080
 there's an immense attachment that's been maintained.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.940
 So that's that dimension of closeness of attachment.

43:00.940 --> 43:02.940
 Clearly there's an understanding that she's dead.

43:02.940 --> 43:05.660
 In fact, the last line of this love letter

43:05.660 --> 43:08.660
 is my wife is dead, right?

43:08.660 --> 43:11.500
 He now moves her into the third person, in fact,

43:11.500 --> 43:12.700
 in that final line.

43:13.960 --> 43:17.880
 So he understands this and yet he maintains the attachment.

43:17.880 --> 43:20.740
 And the very last portion of the letter,

43:20.740 --> 43:22.980
 the P.S., the postscript,

43:22.980 --> 43:24.740
 I don't know your new address, right?

43:24.740 --> 43:26.920
 Somewhat humorous in the typical vein

43:26.920 --> 43:30.020
 of a Feynman writing or speech.

43:30.020 --> 43:33.460
 He always had an intensely amusing

43:33.460 --> 43:35.300
 and playful sense of humor.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.060
 And yet there's something really contained in this,

43:37.060 --> 43:39.700
 I don't think we're reading into this too much,

43:39.700 --> 43:41.880
 in that he doesn't know where to find her.

43:41.880 --> 43:44.640
 He feels her as very real.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.740
 And yet he doesn't know where to find her.

43:46.740 --> 43:48.460
 He doesn't know her address.

43:48.460 --> 43:49.860
 He obviously knows she's dead,

43:49.860 --> 43:51.900
 so there's nowhere to mail it to.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.380
 The reason I shared this letter with you,

43:53.380 --> 43:56.280
 as opposed to one of the almost infinite number

43:56.280 --> 43:59.740
 of other letters that have been written by poets and authors

43:59.740 --> 44:02.860
 and scientists and everyday people,

44:02.860 --> 44:06.100
 is that it really encapsulates all three dimensions

44:06.100 --> 44:08.100
 of attachment and grief.

44:08.100 --> 44:12.320
 These notions of space, where is something or somebody?

44:12.320 --> 44:15.340
 Time, this dimension of how long would it take me

44:15.340 --> 44:17.500
 to reach them or for them to reach me?

44:17.500 --> 44:21.220
 What would it take in terms of time to be reunited?

44:21.220 --> 44:23.980
 And then that last dimension of closeness.

44:23.980 --> 44:26.880
 And the letter beautifully illustrates the fact

44:26.880 --> 44:31.880
 that in grief we maintain that sense of closeness

44:31.880 --> 44:34.460
 and yet we have to uncouple it

44:34.460 --> 44:36.660
 from these other two dimensions,

44:36.660 --> 44:39.780
 as we're referring to space and time.

44:39.780 --> 44:42.480
 So with this current understanding in mind,

44:42.480 --> 44:44.980
 a few things start to become obvious

44:44.980 --> 44:48.080
 and entirely normal to us in the best

44:48.080 --> 44:51.620
 and most healthy sense of the word normal.

44:51.620 --> 44:55.180
 For instance, if you've lost somebody or an animal

44:55.180 --> 44:58.820
 or even a thing that was vitally important to you,

44:58.820 --> 45:00.200
 it should make perfect sense to you

45:00.200 --> 45:03.160
 as to why you keep looking for that person.

45:03.160 --> 45:04.580
 I recall this in my own life,

45:04.580 --> 45:08.100
 I had the unfortunate circumstance of my graduate advisor

45:08.100 --> 45:12.500
 who I was very close with, died quite young, breast cancer.

45:12.500 --> 45:16.660
 And her daughter, she has two daughters,

45:16.660 --> 45:19.720
 kept her cell phone and would occasionally call me.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.880
 I had a quite close relationship to their family.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.260
 And when it would come in,

45:24.260 --> 45:28.060
 the number would pop up on my phone of not the daughter,

45:28.060 --> 45:30.820
 but the name that showed up was of my graduate advisor.

45:30.820 --> 45:33.300
 So for years after she died,

45:33.300 --> 45:35.480
 my initial impulse when the phone would ring was,

45:35.480 --> 45:36.740
 oh my goodness, she's calling.

45:36.740 --> 45:38.860
 It was a reflexive excitement

45:38.860 --> 45:41.980
 because I truly always enjoyed hearing from her.

45:41.980 --> 45:45.000
 She was a wonderful, incredibly wonderful person,

45:45.000 --> 45:45.840
 I should say.

45:46.820 --> 45:48.780
 Similarly, when somebody passes away,

45:48.780 --> 45:50.600
 we will find ourselves looking into a room

45:50.600 --> 45:52.180
 expecting to see them there

45:52.180 --> 45:54.540
 or expecting them to knock on the door any moment

45:54.540 --> 45:58.360
 or to call on Sunday morning, as it were.

45:59.620 --> 46:03.600
 Those expectations, those predictions that the brain

46:03.600 --> 46:06.860
 is making are entirely normal

46:06.860 --> 46:09.580
 because they are based on that deep catalog

46:09.580 --> 46:12.680
 of episodic memory that you maintain about that person.

46:12.680 --> 46:16.320
 Again, the depth and richness of that catalog scaling,

46:16.320 --> 46:19.400
 of course, in direct relation to how close you were

46:19.400 --> 46:20.740
 with that person, right?

46:20.740 --> 46:23.740
 Closer to somebody means more information about them,

46:23.740 --> 46:26.160
 more information about them means your brain

46:26.160 --> 46:29.180
 has a lot of implicit, unconscious notions

46:29.180 --> 46:31.980
 of when and where and how they show up.

46:33.940 --> 46:35.500
 So the fact that your brain,

46:35.500 --> 46:36.980
 and indeed sometimes your body,

46:36.980 --> 46:40.780
 reacts to the expectation that they'll be there

46:40.780 --> 46:42.820
 is entirely normal.

46:42.820 --> 46:45.700
 It's simply an activation of this map

46:45.700 --> 46:48.140
 that involves closeness, space, and time.

46:48.140 --> 46:53.140
 Not surprisingly then, the reordering of that map

46:54.440 --> 46:56.200
 that's required in order to move

46:56.200 --> 46:58.320
 through the grieving process

46:58.320 --> 47:02.420
 is going to involve some remapping.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.640
 And you as the person grieving

47:05.760 --> 47:09.160
 have the opportunity to ask which node, as it's called,

47:09.160 --> 47:12.120
 which element or dimension within that map

47:12.120 --> 47:13.420
 are you going to focus on?

47:13.420 --> 47:18.420
 Some people really try hard to disengage with

47:18.520 --> 47:21.600
 and remap their sense of emotional closeness to the person.

47:21.600 --> 47:25.480
 That is, it's so unbelievably overwhelming to them

47:25.480 --> 47:27.620
 that the person is no longer accessible,

47:27.620 --> 47:30.480
 that they try and change their ideas

47:30.480 --> 47:32.320
 about how close they really were.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.220
 They try and change their emotional attachment

47:34.220 --> 47:36.060
 to the person after they've died.

47:36.060 --> 47:38.960
 Clearly in the example that I gave in the Feynman letter,

47:38.960 --> 47:39.920
 that's not the case.

47:39.920 --> 47:41.880
 The attachment seems indeed quite fixed

47:41.880 --> 47:43.720
 and not going anywhere.

47:43.720 --> 47:46.520
 Psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree

47:46.520 --> 47:49.440
 that the best way to approach moving through grief

47:49.440 --> 47:52.760
 is actually to remap these dimensions

47:52.760 --> 47:55.760
 while maintaining the close sense of attachment

47:55.760 --> 48:00.240
 to the person by not in any way trying to undermine

48:00.240 --> 48:01.800
 the intensity of the attachment

48:01.800 --> 48:04.200
 or how important it was to you.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.380
 So we'll now talk about how that process works

48:07.380 --> 48:11.160
 and the different entry points, as they're called,

48:11.160 --> 48:13.240
 to engaging in that process.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.360
 So one straightforward way to think about

48:15.360 --> 48:18.780
 this state of mind and body that we call grief

48:18.780 --> 48:23.780
 is that the idea that someone or an animal or a thing

48:23.960 --> 48:26.280
 simply does not exist anymore

48:26.280 --> 48:29.920
 is not something that the brain can easily conceptualize.

48:29.920 --> 48:33.720
 And the reason for that is that we,

48:33.720 --> 48:36.080
 as beings that have a brain,

48:36.080 --> 48:39.820
 and a brain as an organ that makes predictions,

48:39.820 --> 48:43.820
 tends to rely more on experience than knowledge.

48:43.820 --> 48:47.440
 In other words, the knowledge that someone or an animal

48:47.440 --> 48:49.960
 or a thing is gone, that it doesn't exist,

48:49.960 --> 48:51.960
 at least not in the dimensionality

48:51.960 --> 48:55.920
 that we were accustomed to relating to them in,

48:55.920 --> 48:59.500
 is something that we can understand logically,

48:59.500 --> 49:02.520
 but that emotionally is very hard to undo

49:02.520 --> 49:06.880
 and from a memory perspective is very hard to undo.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.440
 So it's not just that we are in a state

49:08.440 --> 49:12.520
 of emotional disbelief, it's that we have neurons,

49:12.520 --> 49:14.400
 literally nerve cells and neural circuits,

49:14.400 --> 49:16.960
 connections between nerve cells that are dedicated

49:16.960 --> 49:20.660
 to this vast implicit knowledge of all the things we know

49:20.660 --> 49:23.000
 about that person, animal or thing.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.340
 And just because they are no longer in the dimensionality,

49:27.340 --> 49:32.000
 meaning in the configuration alive or present in our life

49:32.000 --> 49:35.280
 that they were before, doesn't eliminate those memories.

49:35.280 --> 49:37.500
 Those memories persist.

49:37.500 --> 49:41.000
 And so anytime we call to mind the person's name,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.600
 or we call to mind things that remind us of them,

49:44.600 --> 49:47.840
 or we suddenly feel the desire to engage with them,

49:49.180 --> 49:52.800
 the memories, those episodic implicit memories,

49:52.800 --> 49:57.680
 as they're called, all that menu and library of knowledge

49:57.680 --> 50:02.120
 slams us straight in the face and pushes us into a mode

50:02.120 --> 50:04.960
 of wanting to act in a way that's consistent

50:04.960 --> 50:07.760
 with them still being here in the way that all

50:07.760 --> 50:12.240
 that knowledge told us they were when we acquired it.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.420
 That's a very long-winded way of saying

50:14.420 --> 50:17.160
 that there's nothing wrong about the emotional state

50:18.000 --> 50:19.660
 when we are in a state of grief.

50:19.660 --> 50:21.260
 In fact, quite the opposite.

50:21.260 --> 50:23.580
 But there is something wrong about the memories

50:23.580 --> 50:27.160
 because the memories are based on our prior knowledge

50:27.160 --> 50:30.960
 of them and those memories actually do not apply

50:30.960 --> 50:33.280
 to our current knowledge of them.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.060
 And again, even though our brain is a prediction machine

50:36.060 --> 50:38.540
 and it's a very good one, it's not perfect.

50:38.540 --> 50:40.240
 In fact, it's far from perfect.

50:40.240 --> 50:42.140
 So really moving through grief is a process

50:42.140 --> 50:45.880
 of understanding how relationships are mapped in the brain,

50:45.880 --> 50:49.240
 space, time, and closeness, also called attachment,

50:49.240 --> 50:50.640
 understanding those three dimensions,

50:50.640 --> 50:52.840
 understanding that they are closely linked,

50:52.840 --> 50:55.440
 and then understanding that simply the knowledge

50:55.440 --> 50:57.280
 that somebody or something or an animal

50:57.280 --> 51:02.240
 isn't accessible to us does not allow us to discard

51:02.240 --> 51:05.640
 of all the knowledge that we have.

51:05.640 --> 51:06.720
 And as a consequence,

51:06.720 --> 51:09.720
 our brain is constantly generating expectations

51:09.720 --> 51:10.800
 of how to access them,

51:10.800 --> 51:13.740
 even if we know that's completely irrational.

51:13.740 --> 51:17.180
 Now, this should, I would hope,

51:17.180 --> 51:19.400
 assist you in moving through grief.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.640
 It's not a tool of the sort of like a switch

51:22.640 --> 51:24.880
 that you can flip and suddenly not feel grief,

51:24.880 --> 51:27.580
 but it does point to a specific set of mechanisms

51:27.580 --> 51:30.640
 or a specific set of steps that you can engage

51:30.640 --> 51:33.760
 in order to start to move through the grieving process

51:33.760 --> 51:36.500
 in the most adaptive and effective way,

51:36.500 --> 51:39.360
 and in a way that still holds in mind

51:39.360 --> 51:41.360
 your close attachment to the person.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.680
 So let's talk about some of the tools

51:42.680 --> 51:44.800
 for adaptively moving through grief.

51:44.800 --> 51:47.160
 These are tools gleaned from the research psychology,

51:47.160 --> 51:50.320
 the clinical psychology, and the neuroscience literature.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.400
 So I've synthesized my understanding

51:52.400 --> 51:56.740
 of those three literatures to provide the tools

51:56.740 --> 51:58.100
 that I'm about to describe.

51:58.100 --> 52:01.640
 The first one involves the acknowledgement

52:01.640 --> 52:02.920
 and really the understanding

52:02.920 --> 52:05.980
 that you don't want to disengage

52:05.980 --> 52:08.020
 or dismantle your real attachment

52:08.020 --> 52:10.000
 to someone, an animal, or a thing.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
 That's a real thing,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.040
 and there is actually no adaptive reason

52:14.040 --> 52:17.540
 to try and persuade yourself or numb yourself

52:17.540 --> 52:18.800
 or somehow avoid the thinking

52:18.800 --> 52:21.400
 of just how much they meant to you.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.760
 What is important, however,

52:22.760 --> 52:26.180
 is that you make some effort to shift your mindset

52:26.180 --> 52:28.800
 and your understanding of that person

52:28.800 --> 52:31.720
 in a way that holds in mind that yes, indeed,

52:31.720 --> 52:33.920
 the attachment is very real,

52:33.920 --> 52:36.640
 and in some cases is very, very intense,

52:36.640 --> 52:40.360
 but is now going to be uncoupled

52:40.360 --> 52:42.640
 from the other two dimensions of the map,

52:42.640 --> 52:44.520
 namely space and time.

52:44.520 --> 52:47.420
 So again, just to make absolutely clear,

52:47.420 --> 52:49.920
 there's no reason to try and convince yourself

52:49.920 --> 52:51.980
 that you weren't actually that close to this person

52:51.980 --> 52:52.980
 or them to you.

52:52.980 --> 52:55.260
 There's no reason to try

52:55.260 --> 52:58.060
 and reduce the intensity of that attachment.

52:58.060 --> 52:59.240
 To the contrary,

52:59.240 --> 53:01.860
 you want to anchor yourself to that attachment,

53:01.860 --> 53:04.340
 but you want to make sure that your thoughts

53:04.340 --> 53:06.760
 about the person and your feelings

53:06.760 --> 53:09.900
 about the person are not oriented toward,

53:09.900 --> 53:12.740
 or in reference to, I should say, that map,

53:12.740 --> 53:15.940
 that deep catalog of memories that you had.

53:15.940 --> 53:18.320
 Now, this is not simply a fancy way

53:18.320 --> 53:20.020
 of saying don't live in the past.

53:20.020 --> 53:24.340
 This is saying you need to maintain your sense of attachment

53:24.340 --> 53:26.620
 but you need to start making predictions

53:26.620 --> 53:30.300
 and understanding about how you're going to engage

53:30.300 --> 53:31.180
 with that attachment,

53:31.180 --> 53:32.700
 how you're going to feel those things

53:32.700 --> 53:36.160
 without the expectation that things

53:36.160 --> 53:39.140
 that once happened before are going to happen again.

53:39.140 --> 53:41.980
 So it's a complicated process, you can imagine,

53:41.980 --> 53:44.740
 but you really want to hold and register two things at once.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.460
 It's sort of like spinning two plates at once,

53:46.460 --> 53:49.460
 and therefore it's going to feel like effort.

53:49.460 --> 53:52.460
 One way to do this is to set aside a dedicated period

53:52.460 --> 53:56.140
 of time of maybe five or 10,

53:56.140 --> 53:58.380
 maybe even as much as 30 minutes,

53:58.380 --> 54:02.460
 or depending on your capacity, 30 to 45 minutes,

54:02.460 --> 54:05.420
 in which you are going to feel deeply into your closeness

54:05.420 --> 54:08.600
 and your attachment to that person, animal, or thing.

54:08.600 --> 54:12.820
 But you're consciously going to try and prevent yourself

54:12.820 --> 54:16.700
 from thinking about a couple of categories of things.

54:16.700 --> 54:20.820
 First of all, you want to actively try and disengage

54:20.820 --> 54:22.600
 from any attempt to engage

54:22.600 --> 54:26.500
 in what's called counterfactual thinking, the what-ifs.

54:26.500 --> 54:28.840
 What if I had called them a day earlier?

54:28.840 --> 54:31.880
 What if they had taken a different route home?

54:31.880 --> 54:33.980
 What if I had taken a different route home?

54:34.900 --> 54:38.560
 These counterfactual modes of thinking

54:38.560 --> 54:41.220
 are an infinite landscape of possibility,

54:41.220 --> 54:43.860
 and they are very closely tied to guilt.

54:43.860 --> 54:45.200
 Guilt is an interesting emotion.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.120
 We should probably do an entire episode about guilt.

54:48.120 --> 54:52.660
 But guilt, as defined by psychologists and neuroscientists,

54:52.660 --> 54:55.700
 is actually a way of assigning ourselves more agency,

54:55.700 --> 54:59.940
 more capability of controlling reality than actually exists.

54:59.940 --> 55:03.580
 And it's a very slippery slope, and I want to be clear,

55:03.580 --> 55:05.160
 it's not the case that guilt

55:05.160 --> 55:07.220
 is never an appropriate response,

55:07.220 --> 55:11.040
 but in the context of grieving, guilt is very precarious

55:11.040 --> 55:13.500
 because in thinking I could have done this,

55:13.500 --> 55:15.280
 or if I had only done that,

55:16.820 --> 55:20.620
 you are essentially exploring an infinite landscape

55:20.620 --> 55:23.320
 of things that you can never refute.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.000
 You will never know that had you not gone

55:26.000 --> 55:27.460
 down a different path,

55:27.460 --> 55:30.100
 or they had not taken a particular path in life

55:30.100 --> 55:31.700
 that things would have turned out different,

55:31.700 --> 55:35.100
 but you can't know that it would have worked as well,

55:35.100 --> 55:38.740
 meaning you actually don't know that your what-ifs are true

55:38.740 --> 55:40.020
 and you don't know that they're not true.

55:40.020 --> 55:42.980
 And so as an infinite space, it's a very precarious one,

55:42.980 --> 55:46.060
 and it will not allow you to uncouple

55:46.060 --> 55:47.660
 that intense emotional attachment

55:47.660 --> 55:50.160
 that I'm telling you is actually vital to hold onto

55:50.160 --> 55:53.820
 from that catalog of episodic memory that you've established.

55:53.820 --> 55:56.920
 In fact, it's going to strengthen those bonds.

55:56.920 --> 56:00.760
 So in this dedicated five or 10 or 30,

56:00.760 --> 56:02.860
 whatever period of time you can tolerate

56:02.860 --> 56:03.800
 and maintain focus,

56:03.800 --> 56:06.940
 the idea is to think about your attachment in a rich way

56:08.420 --> 56:11.160
 and to perhaps even experience that in your brain and body.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.860
 I think if you're in a stage of grief

56:12.860 --> 56:16.180
 that actually will be fairly reflexive to do,

56:16.180 --> 56:19.680
 but to try as much as possible to hold that grief

56:19.680 --> 56:21.700
 in the present and to be connected

56:21.700 --> 56:23.980
 to your immediate physical environment.

56:23.980 --> 56:27.460
 So you want to orient yourself in current space and time

56:28.400 --> 56:30.360
 rather than focus on memories

56:30.360 --> 56:32.860
 or what you would have liked to see happen

56:32.860 --> 56:34.660
 or the wish that they were still there

56:34.660 --> 56:37.260
 while at the same time thinking about the depth

56:37.260 --> 56:39.420
 and richness of that attachment.

56:39.420 --> 56:43.200
 This is obviously a tight rope walk, so to speak.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.740
 It's an emotionally challenging

56:44.740 --> 56:46.500
 and sometimes even will be experienced

56:46.500 --> 56:50.580
 as a physically challenging tool or experience.

56:50.580 --> 56:53.860
 But in our understanding of how attachments

56:53.860 --> 56:55.780
 and grief are represented in the brain,

56:55.780 --> 56:58.420
 this can be an immensely beneficial practice

56:58.420 --> 57:00.360
 because it is the first step.

57:00.360 --> 57:04.340
 And indeed it represents many of the steps in the voyage

57:04.340 --> 57:07.460
 from the initial shock of loss

57:07.460 --> 57:10.380
 to our ability to hold in mind somebody

57:10.380 --> 57:12.740
 or an animal or a thing in a way that still allows us

57:12.740 --> 57:15.860
 to feel the depth and fullness of connection to them

57:15.860 --> 57:17.300
 without feeling the yearning,

57:17.300 --> 57:19.440
 that reaching for the glass of water

57:19.440 --> 57:22.140
 that unfortunately will never be resolved.

57:22.140 --> 57:25.100
 Keep in mind that as you embark on this process,

57:25.100 --> 57:26.900
 it is entirely normal for your mind

57:26.900 --> 57:30.220
 to flip into various states of expectation

57:30.220 --> 57:31.260
 that they're suddenly going to be there.

57:31.260 --> 57:33.480
 In fact, because of the closeness

57:33.480 --> 57:35.340
 of these three dimensions in the map,

57:35.340 --> 57:37.980
 space, time and attachment,

57:37.980 --> 57:40.980
 it's entirely normal that when you start to think

57:40.980 --> 57:44.640
 about your attachment to somebody or an animal or a thing,

57:44.640 --> 57:46.900
 that you almost start to experience them

57:46.900 --> 57:48.980
 as present in that environment.

57:48.980 --> 57:51.100
 I'll share with you a somewhat bizarre

57:51.100 --> 57:53.060
 or it sounds bizarre to articulate out loud,

57:53.060 --> 57:55.960
 but many of you perhaps will resonate with this.

57:55.960 --> 57:58.900
 For years after my graduate advisor died,

57:58.900 --> 58:00.740
 I would get an experience of someone touching the back

58:00.740 --> 58:03.360
 of my neck when I would think about her.

58:03.360 --> 58:06.620
 And that was not an experience I ever had with her, right?

58:06.620 --> 58:07.940
 It was a professional relationship.

58:07.940 --> 58:10.780
 I don't ever recall her touching the back of my neck

58:10.780 --> 58:13.380
 or me touching the back of my neck in her presence,

58:13.380 --> 58:15.760
 at least not on a regular basis.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.820
 So it was very perplexing to me.

58:17.820 --> 58:21.140
 And then I encountered this incredible literature on grief,

58:21.140 --> 58:22.380
 which said the following.

58:23.420 --> 58:26.880
 Grief in many ways is like a phantom limb.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.860
 For those of you that aren't familiar,

58:28.860 --> 58:31.940
 many people who experience amputation of a limb,

58:31.940 --> 58:35.160
 either through surgery or accident or otherwise,

58:35.160 --> 58:36.940
 will feel in a very genuine way

58:36.940 --> 58:38.280
 that the limb is still present,

58:38.280 --> 58:41.140
 even though when they look for the limb, it's not there.

58:41.140 --> 58:42.680
 So they can feel pain in limbs.

58:42.680 --> 58:45.140
 They can feel the sensation of touch.

58:45.140 --> 58:47.460
 There's some famous experiments from the neurologist

58:47.460 --> 58:49.380
 and my former colleague at University of California,

58:49.380 --> 58:52.420
 San Diego, who goes by his last name, Ramachandran.

58:52.420 --> 58:54.660
 Some people just call him Rama.

58:54.660 --> 58:56.420
 He's an incredible scientist

58:56.420 --> 58:58.980
 and has done a lot of really important work,

58:58.980 --> 59:01.780
 in particular on phantom limb, among other things.

59:01.780 --> 59:03.740
 And has done some beautiful experiments

59:03.740 --> 59:07.100
 showing that people who have phantom limb pain

59:07.100 --> 59:10.020
 or that are experiencing different sensations

59:10.020 --> 59:11.820
 in their phantom limb, that can be very intrusive,

59:11.820 --> 59:15.140
 much in the same way that expecting someone

59:15.140 --> 59:18.820
 to walk through the door who you happen to know is deceased

59:18.820 --> 59:20.500
 can be very intrusive.

59:20.500 --> 59:22.740
 Ramachandran's done beautiful experiments

59:22.740 --> 59:25.420
 showing that if you give people what's called a mirror box,

59:25.420 --> 59:29.280
 this is a box in which you insert an intact limb,

59:29.280 --> 59:32.100
 and there are some mirrors that give you the visual impression

59:32.100 --> 59:33.720
 that the other limb is still present,

59:33.720 --> 59:35.280
 and you move the intact limb

59:35.280 --> 59:38.760
 and you get a mirror image of the non-existent,

59:38.760 --> 59:42.340
 but nonetheless visual image of the phantom limb moving,

59:42.340 --> 59:44.400
 that you can resolve some of the pain of a limb

59:44.400 --> 59:46.020
 that feels otherwise cramped up.

59:46.020 --> 59:48.120
 In other words, the visual perception

59:48.120 --> 59:50.420
 can reverse some of these phantom sensations.

59:51.500 --> 59:54.460
 In many ways, the phantom limb scenario

59:54.460 --> 59:56.920
 and what I described about a sensation

59:56.920 --> 59:58.420
 of being touched on the back of the neck

59:58.420 --> 1:00:02.200
 or this feeling that we have when we engage in the thinking

1:00:02.200 --> 1:00:03.780
 and the emotions of our attachment

1:00:03.780 --> 1:00:06.140
 to someone, an animal, or a thing

1:00:06.140 --> 1:00:07.540
 is very much like a phantom limb,

1:00:07.540 --> 1:00:10.060
 only it exists in the emotional space,

1:00:10.060 --> 1:00:13.580
 and it exists because it is reactivation

1:00:13.580 --> 1:00:18.140
 of these maps about space, time, and person.

1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:21.420
 And so if the process of moving through grief adaptively

1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:24.260
 in a healthy way involves maintaining the attachment,

1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:25.620
 but uncoupling that attachment

1:00:25.620 --> 1:00:28.540
 from the space and time representation of that person,

1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:31.020
 animal, or thing that we had before,

1:00:31.020 --> 1:00:32.800
 well, then the question becomes,

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.020
 where should we place our expectation of them, right?

1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:40.280
 Now, that of course will vary from person to person.

1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:42.380
 Some people with particular religious beliefs

1:00:42.380 --> 1:00:45.820
 will indeed believe that the soul of the person,

1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:48.860
 the molecules of the person have been reordered

1:00:48.860 --> 1:00:52.100
 and exist in some sort of either distributed domain, right?

1:00:52.100 --> 1:00:55.140
 That they are in everything or they are in one location.

1:00:55.140 --> 1:00:58.380
 I'm not here to speak to that one way or the other.

1:00:58.380 --> 1:00:59.940
 There's no good experiment I know

1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:03.820
 either to prove or disprove that, nor would I want to.

1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:05.700
 It's not the job of science, frankly.

1:01:07.260 --> 1:01:11.540
 However, allowing ourselves to place notions

1:01:11.540 --> 1:01:15.620
 of where that person, animal, or thing is

1:01:16.620 --> 1:01:19.980
 in their current new configuration, whatever that might be,

1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:21.500
 ashes, dashes, dust to dust,

1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:23.420
 or that the person's soul comes out of their body,

1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:24.740
 these are all the different variations

1:01:24.740 --> 1:01:25.920
 that people hear, or some people think,

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.180
 well, it's just molecules and they disintegrate

1:01:28.180 --> 1:01:30.700
 and are reordered and come up as the plants and the trees.

1:01:30.700 --> 1:01:34.300
 Again, a near infinite number of possibilities

1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:36.740
 and it depends a lot on personal belief.

1:01:38.860 --> 1:01:42.380
 It is, however, essential that no matter what you believe,

1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:45.560
 that you have some firm representation

1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:48.020
 of where that person, animal, or thing is

1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:51.060
 so that you can plug it into this map,

1:01:51.060 --> 1:01:56.060
 this three-dimensional map of space, time, and attachment.

1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:57.580
 The process of moving through grief

1:01:57.580 --> 1:01:59.940
 can't simply be that we hold onto the attachment

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:01.800
 and we discard with any understanding

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.420
 of where they are in space and time.

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:05.780
 And actually, the letter that Feynman wrote

1:02:05.780 --> 1:02:08.460
 to his deceased wife, Arlene,

1:02:08.460 --> 1:02:12.160
 again, so beautifully and really poignantly

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:14.060
 illustrates the fact that he doesn't really know

1:02:14.060 --> 1:02:15.260
 where to find her.

1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:17.900
 On the one hand, he really understands that she's gone

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:19.460
 and on the other hand, he understands

1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:22.780
 that he still very much expects her to be there,

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:23.960
 that he would like to mail the letter,

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:28.520
 but then, of course, in this final, somewhat humorous line,

1:02:29.420 --> 1:02:32.300
 he doesn't know where to send the letter, he tells us.

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:35.580
 What's very clear and I think is very healthy

1:02:35.580 --> 1:02:38.860
 is the fact that the emotional bond is still there,

1:02:38.860 --> 1:02:40.420
 that that is maintained.

1:02:40.420 --> 1:02:44.660
 And so this tool, if you will, of dedicated blocks of time

1:02:44.660 --> 1:02:47.220
 for really spending some effort,

1:02:47.220 --> 1:02:50.240
 and it is indeed effort to access the emotional connection

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:53.420
 while starting to uncouple the other nodes of the map,

1:02:53.420 --> 1:02:56.420
 as it were, is something that is hard.

1:02:56.420 --> 1:02:58.440
 You should expect it to be hard,

1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:00.700
 but in terms of the options one has

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:02.580
 in order to deal with grief,

1:03:02.580 --> 1:03:06.180
 it is indeed the most adaptive way to go about it.

1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:08.540
 You're not trying to avoid thinking about it.

1:03:08.540 --> 1:03:11.260
 You're not engaging in this counterfactual thinking,

1:03:11.260 --> 1:03:13.180
 the what if, what if, what if.

1:03:13.180 --> 1:03:15.540
 You're not drowning it out with substances

1:03:15.540 --> 1:03:20.540
 or delusion or with other ways of distracting yourself.

1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:23.260
 So in that sense, it is truly adaptive.

1:03:23.260 --> 1:03:24.760
 Now, of course, I don't want to imply

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:27.900
 that I'm a clinical psychologist, I'm certainly not.

1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:29.340
 There is absolutely a place

1:03:29.340 --> 1:03:31.060
 for working with a trained professional

1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:34.280
 to move through grief, especially these situations,

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:38.060
 these one in 10 people who deal

1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:39.600
 with what's called complicated grief

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:40.900
 or very prolonged grief.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:41.940
 Those are somewhat different things,

1:03:41.940 --> 1:03:43.500
 but in general point to the fact

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:46.280
 that there are people who have an exceptionally hard time

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:47.120
 moving through grief.

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:48.860
 We'll talk about who those people are

1:03:48.860 --> 1:03:50.040
 and ways to move through them

1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:53.980
 with or without a professional to assist you.

1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:56.760
 But nonetheless, we're starting to understand

1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:59.420
 on the basis of neuroscience,

1:03:59.420 --> 1:04:01.380
 what some of the more adaptive and functional ways

1:04:01.380 --> 1:04:02.880
 of moving through grief are.

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:05.980
 In order to really understand how a tool of the sort

1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:08.440
 that we're describing ought to work

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:13.440
 and what it's designed to accomplish at a mechanistic level,

1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:15.980
 I'd like to teach you about a very important aspect

1:04:15.980 --> 1:04:19.960
 of your brain function that has everything to do with grief

1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:22.060
 and the process of moving through grief,

1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:24.700
 but has a lot to do with other aspects

1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:26.940
 of our life experience as well.

1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:28.060
 Some of you are probably familiar

1:04:28.060 --> 1:04:30.100
 with a brain area called the hippocampus.

1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:32.300
 The hippocampus is a structure that's involved

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:33.860
 in the formation of new memories,

1:04:33.860 --> 1:04:37.100
 but not the maintenance of memories.

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:39.940
 I discussed the hippocampus in detail

1:04:39.940 --> 1:04:42.460
 in our episode on memory and our episode

1:04:42.460 --> 1:04:45.660
 with our guest, Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,

1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:47.340
 an expert on learning and memory.

1:04:48.820 --> 1:04:50.460
 During those two discussions,

1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:53.540
 I did not however touch into what the different cell types

1:04:53.540 --> 1:04:56.660
 are in the hippocampus and the different roles they perform.

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:59.140
 And it turns out that there are indeed different cell types

1:04:59.140 --> 1:05:01.620
 in the hippocampus and they performed very different roles

1:05:01.620 --> 1:05:04.780
 that are absolutely central to the grief process.

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:07.760
 We have cells in our hippocampus,

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:10.580
 meaning you have cells in your hippocampus.

1:05:10.580 --> 1:05:15.020
 These cells are neurons, nerve cells that fire anytime or,

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:17.440
 and when we say fire, I should just remind you.

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:20.940
 I mean, have electrical activity.

1:05:20.940 --> 1:05:25.580
 Anytime that we enter a particular familiar location.

1:05:25.580 --> 1:05:28.340
 So for instance, think about your bedroom

1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:31.000
 and think about where the bed is.

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.600
 As you're doing that, these so-called place cells are firing

1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:37.260
 not necessarily to represent that it's a bed

1:05:37.260 --> 1:05:40.180
 at that location, but to represent the location itself.

1:05:41.220 --> 1:05:43.600
 We also have neurons in our hippocampus

1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:45.680
 and elsewhere in our brain, I should say,

1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:48.380
 that represent proximity.

1:05:48.380 --> 1:05:49.660
 So for instance, if you were to wake up

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:51.780
 in the middle of the night and walk into the kitchen

1:05:51.780 --> 1:05:54.900
 and it's somewhat dark and you orient toward the sink

1:05:54.900 --> 1:05:57.620
 to get yourself a glass of water or to the refrigerator

1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:00.940
 to get yourself something to drink or to eat,

1:06:00.940 --> 1:06:05.120
 as you get close to the sink or the refrigerator,

1:06:06.100 --> 1:06:07.660
 there are neurons in your hippocampus

1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:10.760
 that are going to start engaging electrical activity

1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:14.080
 because you are in the mere expected proximity

1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:16.940
 of the sink or refrigerator and you know where they are,

1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:18.940
 hence the word expected.

1:06:18.940 --> 1:06:20.420
 Now that all seems fine and good.

1:06:20.420 --> 1:06:23.020
 You've got neurons that represent where things are

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:26.180
 and sort of goes without saying that those same neurons

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:29.520
 map to our emotional attachments.

1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:31.820
 We generally know where to find our loved ones,

1:06:31.820 --> 1:06:33.500
 even if they don't live with us,

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:35.780
 we generally know what city they're in.

1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:36.700
 Even if they're traveling,

1:06:36.700 --> 1:06:39.100
 we generally have a sense of where they're traveling

1:06:39.100 --> 1:06:41.900
 or the general area in which they're traveling.

1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:43.940
 Place cells and proximity cells are involved

1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:46.960
 in that kind of mapping and representations as well.

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:48.160
 Now there's a third kind of cell

1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:50.960
 that's particularly important for the sort of tool

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.420
 that we were talking about earlier,

1:06:52.420 --> 1:06:55.180
 that tool of holding onto the emotional attachment

1:06:55.180 --> 1:06:57.620
 to somebody and yet trying to deliberately

1:06:57.620 --> 1:07:00.020
 remap our understanding of where they are

1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:01.120
 in space and time.

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:04.660
 And that has to do with a category of cells

1:07:04.660 --> 1:07:06.640
 called trace cells.

1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:09.460
 Trace cells were discovered by a number of laboratories.

1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:13.020
 I think the most renowned of those is the Moser Laboratory.

1:07:13.020 --> 1:07:15.100
 The Mosers are a couple, actually,

1:07:15.100 --> 1:07:17.220
 they were a couple, they're now,

1:07:17.220 --> 1:07:19.940
 I think amicably separated or divorced.

1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:21.300
 That's not what this episode's about.

1:07:21.300 --> 1:07:22.940
 If I have that wrong, forgive me,

1:07:24.180 --> 1:07:26.960
 Edvard and Brittan are their names.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.420
 Their relationship isn't what's important,

1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:32.420
 except what is important is the work that they did together

1:07:32.420 --> 1:07:33.340
 in one form or another,

1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:36.100
 which was very important work establishing

1:07:36.100 --> 1:07:37.660
 this category of cells in the,

1:07:37.660 --> 1:07:38.700
 not just in the hippocampus,

1:07:38.700 --> 1:07:40.700
 but in an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex

1:07:40.700 --> 1:07:43.100
 that act as a sort of coordinate system

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:44.940
 to orient us in space and time.

1:07:46.300 --> 1:07:50.860
 Trace cells are activated when we expect something

1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:53.740
 to be at a given location, but it's not there.

1:07:55.020 --> 1:07:56.700
 Experiments done in their laboratory

1:07:56.700 --> 1:08:00.500
 and in other laboratories have shown that, for instance,

1:08:00.500 --> 1:08:04.880
 if you give a rodent or frankly a person,

1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:08.180
 a object that always resides at the same location

1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:12.720
 and we reach to it in order to access it,

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:16.400
 let's say where your coffee maker is in the morning.

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:18.460
 I do a pour over coffee.

1:08:18.460 --> 1:08:21.280
 If I'm drinking coffee or mate, I'll do a pour over.

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:24.020
 It's always more or less in the same location.

1:08:24.020 --> 1:08:26.940
 And so there are place cells and proximity cells

1:08:26.940 --> 1:08:28.460
 that relate to my being able to find

1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:31.320
 that pour over coffee cone thing.

1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:34.780
 However, if I were to go to that location

1:08:34.780 --> 1:08:38.580
 and it wasn't there, the trace cells,

1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:40.300
 these neurons in my hippocampus

1:08:40.300 --> 1:08:42.380
 and an entorhinal cortex and elsewhere,

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:43.580
 because again, these cells are connected

1:08:43.580 --> 1:08:45.740
 by way of circuitry, by way of connections,

1:08:46.660 --> 1:08:48.180
 those trace cells would fire.

1:08:48.180 --> 1:08:49.940
 We could even call it a trace circuit.

1:08:49.940 --> 1:08:52.580
 It's a circuit that has an expectation

1:08:52.580 --> 1:08:53.920
 that something will be in a location,

1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:56.620
 but when something is not at that location,

1:08:56.620 --> 1:08:58.340
 this circuit becomes active.

1:08:58.340 --> 1:09:00.260
 This is important because what we're talking about here

1:09:00.260 --> 1:09:02.920
 is a neural circuit and a set of neurons

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:05.260
 that are responsible not for the presence of something,

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:07.360
 but the absence of something.

1:09:08.860 --> 1:09:10.100
 We have every reason to believe

1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:13.340
 based on neuroimaging studies and studies in animal models,

1:09:13.340 --> 1:09:17.580
 that trace cells become very active in the immediate stage

1:09:17.580 --> 1:09:19.380
 after the loss of a loved one.

1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:24.380
 That the brain and our maps of the person, place, or thing

1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:29.220
 that we know cognitively, we understand,

1:09:29.220 --> 1:09:31.840
 we even believe they are gone.

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:33.940
 They are not accessible for whatever reason,

1:09:33.940 --> 1:09:35.580
 death or otherwise.

1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:37.880
 And yet we have neurons that are firing

1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:41.420
 to reveal that absence to us.

1:09:41.420 --> 1:09:46.140
 And these neurons are closely associated with neurons

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:48.940
 that tell us where things ought to be.

1:09:48.940 --> 1:09:52.380
 So if you feel the expectation or you sense

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.500
 that somebody should walk through the door any moment

1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:57.620
 or call at any moment or be next to you when you wake up,

1:09:57.620 --> 1:10:00.900
 and yet you cognitively understand that they won't,

1:10:00.900 --> 1:10:02.540
 that there's no real reason why they should

1:10:02.540 --> 1:10:06.180
 because they are indeed gone, you are not crazy.

1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:11.180
 In fact, it's simply a reflection of the normal functioning

1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:13.780
 of these trace cells and trace circuits.

1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:16.060
 Now I'd like to consider why two people,

1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:21.060
 both who are intensely attached to a person

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:25.060
 that is no longer there can experience the grief

1:10:25.060 --> 1:10:27.940
 of the loss of that person in such different ways.

1:10:27.940 --> 1:10:29.260
 This is often observed.

1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:33.600
 You can have, you know, God forbid, incredibly sadly,

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:35.520
 in cases where a child is lost,

1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:38.760
 where both parents are grieving intensely,

1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:42.400
 but one seems to feel it at a emotional depth and level

1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:44.040
 that seems distinct from the other.

1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:46.260
 Now, of course, keep in mind

1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:49.540
 that we never really know how other people are feeling.

1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:52.580
 This is something actually that was raised in the episode

1:10:52.580 --> 1:10:54.700
 where I interviewed a psychiatrist

1:10:54.700 --> 1:10:56.760
 and researcher colleague of mine from Stanford,

1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:57.820
 Carl Deisseroth.

1:10:58.940 --> 1:11:02.440
 As a psychiatrist, I heard him say once

1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:04.820
 that we really don't know how other people feel.

1:11:04.820 --> 1:11:06.600
 In fact, a lot of the times we don't even really know

1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:08.300
 how we feel, or at least describing that

1:11:08.300 --> 1:11:10.880
 is quite challenging with language often.

1:11:11.940 --> 1:11:13.020
 And indeed that is the case.

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.360
 We don't really know how other people feel.

1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.440
 There's no clear way of knowing

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:19.900
 that the expression someone else has

1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:21.420
 or whether or not they're crying or not,

1:11:21.420 --> 1:11:23.700
 or their body language really represents

1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:24.740
 how they feel inside.

1:11:24.740 --> 1:11:27.140
 So that is important to keep in mind.

1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:31.620
 Nonetheless, there does seem to be a sort of a split

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:35.460
 among people and indeed among animals as well,

1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:39.380
 even within a species in terms of how intensely they feel,

1:11:39.380 --> 1:11:42.660
 the yearning aspect of grief.

1:11:42.660 --> 1:11:45.420
 And it appears based on a number of different lines

1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:47.960
 of evidence that that relates to this molecule

1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:50.740
 that some of you have probably heard of, which is oxytocin.

1:11:50.740 --> 1:11:54.200
 Oxytocin is a hormone slash peptide.

1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:58.140
 A peptide just means a protein, generally a small protein.

1:11:58.140 --> 1:12:00.580
 And a hormone is generally something

1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:02.860
 that functions at numerous locations in the body

1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:05.740
 to impact numerous organs and areas of the brain.

1:12:05.740 --> 1:12:08.700
 So a peptide can be a hormone and a hormone can be a peptide.

1:12:08.700 --> 1:12:10.260
 They are not mutually exclusive.

1:12:10.260 --> 1:12:13.740
 Oxytocin has a variety of roles in the brain and body.

1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:16.600
 It's involved in milk let down during lactation.

1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:19.820
 It's involved in pair bonding, both in males and females.

1:12:19.820 --> 1:12:22.300
 It's involved in bonding of parent to child

1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:27.300
 and indeed between romantic partners, et cetera, et cetera.

1:12:27.540 --> 1:12:30.100
 Let's talk about some of the animal models that inform us

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:31.900
 about the potential roles of oxytocin

1:12:31.900 --> 1:12:33.200
 in the grieving process.

1:12:34.420 --> 1:12:37.180
 There's a species of animal called the prairie vole.

1:12:37.180 --> 1:12:38.820
 And believe it or not, the prairie vole

1:12:38.820 --> 1:12:40.980
 has been studied fairly extensively

1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:44.140
 by neuroscience and psychology researchers.

1:12:44.140 --> 1:12:45.840
 In fact, our former director

1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:49.220
 of the National Institutes of Mental Health, Tom Insel,

1:12:49.220 --> 1:12:52.780
 his laboratory focused quite heavily on prairie voles.

1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:54.620
 Prairie voles are one species of animal,

1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:56.820
 but depending on where they live,

1:12:56.820 --> 1:12:59.900
 you find that some prairie voles are monogamous.

1:12:59.900 --> 1:13:04.900
 That is, they mate with the same prairie vole for life.

1:13:04.900 --> 1:13:09.140
 They raise litters of little prairie voles for life

1:13:09.140 --> 1:13:11.600
 and other prairie voles generally

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:14.420
 that live in different locations in the wild

1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:17.780
 are non-monogamous, sometimes called polygamous.

1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:22.020
 The neurochemical and circuit basis

1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:25.980
 for this monogamy versus non-monogamy are quite interesting.

1:13:27.620 --> 1:13:29.780
 However, in the context of grief and attachment,

1:13:29.780 --> 1:13:31.820
 the prairie voles have taught us a lot

1:13:31.820 --> 1:13:32.660
 and they've taught us a lot

1:13:32.660 --> 1:13:34.560
 through the following experiment.

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:37.100
 Take two prairie voles that are coupled up,

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:39.560
 so these would be monogamous prairie voles

1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:43.140
 that have established a couple-dom.

1:13:43.140 --> 1:13:46.860
 I guess you would call that a prairie vold-dom, anyway.

1:13:46.860 --> 1:13:48.900
 Put them in a cage together, they mate together,

1:13:48.900 --> 1:13:53.020
 they raise young together, and then you separate them.

1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:55.480
 You literally put a physical barrier

1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:58.580
 between the two of them and you can evaluate

1:13:58.580 --> 1:14:02.140
 how strongly one prairie vole will work

1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:04.940
 to get access to the other prairie vole, right?

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:07.760
 This is sort of the Romeo and Juliet

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:09.340
 of prairie vole experiments.

1:14:10.260 --> 1:14:13.860
 And what you observe is that the monogamous prairie voles

1:14:13.860 --> 1:14:16.420
 will work very hard to get back to their mate,

1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:17.540
 to get access to their mate.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:20.440
 They will lever press, they'll even walk across

1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:23.780
 a metal plate that they get an electrical shock.

1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:25.460
 They will work very, very hard.

1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:28.100
 They will cross rivers and valleys, if you will,

1:14:28.100 --> 1:14:31.760
 in the experimental context, that is.

1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.400
 The polygamous prairie voles, and again,

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:38.320
 we don't know if they're polyamorous,

1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:40.040
 we don't know what they feel, right?

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:41.040
 We don't know if they're in love

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:43.900
 or if they're motivated simply for other things,

1:14:43.900 --> 1:14:46.760
 but the non-monogamous prairie voles

1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:51.760
 will not work as hard to access a prairie vole partner.

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:54.960
 Now, you could argue that's because they expect

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:56.500
 that there will be other prairie vole partners,

1:14:56.500 --> 1:14:58.420
 but even if they've never experienced another prairie vole

1:14:58.420 --> 1:15:02.080
 partner, they won't work quite as hard to get back

1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:04.800
 in connection with this other prairie vole

1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:06.800
 to mate or otherwise.

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.640
 This turns out to be interesting

1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:10.920
 when you start to explore the patterns

1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:14.720
 of so-called oxytocin receptors in the brain.

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:15.960
 To make a long story short,

1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:18.180
 and to also bridge to the human literature,

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:23.120
 it turns out that the monogamous prairie voles

1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:26.560
 have far more oxytocin receptors in this brain area

1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:29.320
 that I mentioned earlier, the nucleus accumbens.

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:31.300
 And again, to remind you, the nucleus accumbens

1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:33.880
 is a brain area associated with motivation,

1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:35.660
 craving, and pursuit.

1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:39.020
 So it's as if the monogamous prairie voles

1:15:39.020 --> 1:15:44.020
 have a capacity to link the attachment circuitry

1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:47.480
 and the molecules of attachment, in this case, oxytocin,

1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:51.800
 to reward pathways and to motivational pathways.

1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:55.000
 Polygamous, or we should say non-monogamous prairie voles

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:55.940
 do as well.

1:15:56.800 --> 1:15:59.740
 However, they have less oxytocin receptors.

1:15:59.740 --> 1:16:03.300
 So in other words, non-monogamous prairie voles

1:16:03.300 --> 1:16:06.620
 seem to have less yearning for attachment overall,

1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:09.640
 at least to a single individual prairie vole.

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:11.760
 And when we look at the human literature

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:14.400
 in terms of oxytocin receptor expression

1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:17.400
 and brain imaging experiments and so on,

1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:18.320
 what you find is the same.

1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:20.960
 The people that experience intense grief

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:25.800
 and a deep yearning and a motivation to reconnect

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:28.760
 with the person, animal, or thing that is lost,

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:32.320
 in many cases have heightened levels of oxytocin,

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:35.480
 specifically, or I should say oxytocin receptors

1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:38.660
 to be exact, specifically within the brain regions

1:16:38.660 --> 1:16:41.520
 associated with craving and pursuit.

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:43.160
 So for those of you that find yourself

1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:45.680
 in this kind of stuck mode,

1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:49.600
 this persistence of trying to reach into the past

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:53.900
 or wishful thinking, this counterfactual thinking,

1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:55.640
 if only, if only, if only,

1:16:57.080 --> 1:16:59.200
 you don't necessarily want to pathologize that thinking.

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:01.080
 First of all, we should acknowledge

1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:02.800
 that it's not necessarily adaptive.

1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:05.020
 And in fact, in the complete loss of somebody,

1:17:05.020 --> 1:17:06.680
 or if somebody says they don't want anything to do

1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:09.440
 with you ever again, by all means,

1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:10.720
 if that's expressed clearly,

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:13.600
 then you need to accept that reality.

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:17.120
 But the yearning, the desire, and the impulsivity,

1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:21.680
 the kind of leaning in and at a almost reflexive way

1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:23.240
 to try and access that person again,

1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.920
 to text them, to want to hear from them could,

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:28.400
 and I have to highlight could reflect the fact

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:31.420
 that you just so happen to have more oxytocin receptors

1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:35.260
 or maybe more oxytocin overall in this brain area

1:17:35.260 --> 1:17:38.360
 that's associated with motivation and pursuit.

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.880
 It does not necessarily mean that you are more capable

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:43.120
 of attachment than people who move

1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:44.900
 through grief more quickly.

1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:47.880
 And I should say that people move through grief

1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:51.540
 at different rates, even if two people lost the same person

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:53.800
 or same animal, people move through this at different rates.

1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:56.880
 And some of that is no doubt psychological,

1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:00.400
 but some of it no doubt is also neurochemical

1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:01.640
 and biological.

1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:02.860
 And in sharing this with you,

1:18:02.860 --> 1:18:05.080
 I hope it sheds some understanding

1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:08.580
 and perhaps even some compassion for people

1:18:08.580 --> 1:18:10.440
 who are moving through things more quickly

1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:12.040
 or in a different way.

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:15.120
 And of course, it should also, I would hope,

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:17.680
 shed compassion and understanding for people

1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:21.400
 that seem incapable of quote unquote, moving on.

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.100
 It's taking them far longer to move on.

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:26.360
 Earlier, we talked about complicated grief,

1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:29.360
 non-complicated grief and prolonged grief disorder.

1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:31.640
 And I should say that the precise divisions

1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:36.220
 between these categories is not very precise.

1:18:36.220 --> 1:18:39.080
 It takes a really trained expert to be able to identify

1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:40.160
 whether or not somebody is

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:42.640
 in the prolonged grief disorder category,

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:45.100
 complicated or non-complicated grief.

1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:46.880
 There's actually a set of questionnaires

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:49.640
 that I invite you to answer if you like.

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:52.600
 They were provided, or I should say I access them

1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:56.720
 through a public site on Mary Frances O'Connor's webpage.

1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:58.520
 We'll put them in the show note captions.

1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:00.920
 You actually can submit those answers in an anonymous way

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:02.800
 to a study that she's doing.

1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.600
 She has several surveys,

1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:07.360
 one for loss of a romantic relationship,

1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:11.240
 other for loss due to death of somebody,

1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:13.800
 and still another one that relates to homesickness.

1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:15.960
 And it's also available in several different languages.

1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:18.240
 So I provide a link to that website.

1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:19.200
 It's very easy to download.

1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:20.680
 There's no cost to that at all.

1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:23.680
 You can contribute to the scientific data collection process

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:24.520
 if you like.

1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:26.760
 And I do believe that you get your scores back

1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:30.080
 or an interpretation of your scores by participating there.

1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:34.360
 When Mary Frances O'Connor hopefully comes on the podcast,

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:36.000
 she can tell us some more of the detail

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.880
 about separating out this prolonged grief disorder,

1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:40.780
 complicated and uncomplicated grief.

1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:42.540
 But in the meantime,

1:19:43.500 --> 1:19:45.120
 it's very clear that people move through grief

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:46.380
 at different rates.

1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:48.200
 And as I mentioned just a moment ago,

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:49.720
 that this is entirely normal,

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:52.360
 probably has a basis in neurochemicals

1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:54.920
 and hormones such as oxytocin.

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:56.220
 There are probably other reasons as well.

1:19:56.220 --> 1:19:58.760
 In fact, we can assume with almost certainty

1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:01.160
 that there are other reasons as well.

1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:04.800
 Nonetheless, I think it is really important to think about

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:06.720
 why some people might have a harder time

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:09.880
 moving through grief due to life circumstance,

1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:11.700
 innate differences and so on.

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:15.300
 There's a very nice set of studies,

1:20:15.300 --> 1:20:17.340
 but one in particular entitled

1:20:17.340 --> 1:20:20.960
 Catecholamine Predictors of Complicated Grief Outcomes.

1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:23.840
 Here again, the first author is Mary Frances O'Connor

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:25.720
 reminding us that she's done so much important work

1:20:25.720 --> 1:20:26.540
 in this area.

1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:29.960
 This paper has several conclusions,

1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:32.000
 but one of the key conclusions

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.800
 is that this particular category of molecules

1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:34.960
 we call the catecholamines.

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:37.320
 The catecholamines include epinephrine,

1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:38.480
 which is also adrenaline,

1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:40.360
 norepinephrine, which is noradrenaline

1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:43.120
 and dopamine, which you've learned about before.

1:20:44.420 --> 1:20:46.260
 Here I'm just going to paraphrase

1:20:46.260 --> 1:20:48.240
 or I'll read directly actually.

1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:50.440
 What they found was that participants,

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:51.840
 again, this is human subjects,

1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:53.920
 with the highest levels of epinephrine,

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:56.400
 of adrenaline pre-treatment,

1:20:56.400 --> 1:20:58.760
 had the highest levels of complicated grief symptoms

1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:00.940
 post-treatment and that could account

1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:02.440
 for their baseline level of symptoms.

1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:04.120
 What this means is that people

1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:05.880
 that have a lot of circulating adrenaline,

1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:09.160
 we might even call these people who are

1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:13.080
 or typically reside at a higher level of autonomic arousal.

1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:14.440
 We have an autonomic nervous system

1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:17.620
 that dictates how calm or alert or stressed

1:21:17.620 --> 1:21:19.260
 we happen to be just at baseline.

1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:22.280
 People who tend to be more alert and anxious at baseline

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:25.760
 prior to any grief episode tend to have,

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:28.280
 or statistically on average we should say,

1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:31.680
 are more likely to experience complicated grief

1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:34.040
 and maybe even prolonged grief symptoms.

1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:38.740
 So if you're somebody that is anticipating losing someone

1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:40.320
 or an animal or a thing at some point,

1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:42.880
 and I think that really means everybody,

1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:45.960
 utilizing tools to adjust your epinephrine,

1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:48.620
 your adrenaline levels down has a number

1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:50.200
 of important benefits, improving sleep,

1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:52.040
 health metrics, et cetera.

1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:53.180
 There are tools to do that.

1:21:53.180 --> 1:21:55.140
 We have an episode on mastering stress

1:21:55.140 --> 1:21:57.300
 that you can find at our website,

1:21:57.300 --> 1:21:59.720
 humanlab.com, it has a lot of behavioral tools

1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:01.160
 that are backed by science.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:02.920
 Some of work that was done in my laboratory,

1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:05.620
 but certainly other laboratories as well

1:22:05.620 --> 1:22:09.780
 that will allow you to control your autonomic nervous system

1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:13.720
 both in real time and reduce the overall level of stress

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:17.220
 and even chronic activation of the so-called sympathetic arm

1:22:17.220 --> 1:22:18.280
 of the autonomic nervous system,

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:20.480
 which is just fancy geek speak for saying,

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:22.540
 there are tools to help you be calm,

1:22:22.540 --> 1:22:24.840
 not just for sake of navigating daily stress,

1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:27.360
 but as this paper illustrates,

1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:30.120
 for anticipating the fact that at some point

1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:32.880
 you will lose somebody, an animal or a thing.

1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:35.960
 And there is a way to move through that process

1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:37.840
 that we call healthy normal grieving.

1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:39.840
 And then there's the so-called complicated grief

1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:44.420
 or prolonged grief disorders that reflect immense challenge

1:22:44.420 --> 1:22:47.440
 in moving through grief at a reasonable rate.

1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:51.040
 So you can somewhat inoculate yourself

1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:53.280
 against complicated or prolonged grief

1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:56.240
 by reducing your resting levels of,

1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:00.400
 or your pre-loss levels of epinephrine, of adrenaline.

1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:02.320
 And again, there are excellent tools to do that.

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:03.880
 I won't review them here for sake of time,

1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:06.840
 but they're timestamped and you can access those easily.

1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:09.060
 Again, zero cost tools.

1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:12.000
 Going back to this paper,

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.040
 catecholamine predictors

1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:15.800
 of complicated grief treatment outcomes

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:18.520
 should say that not only did participants

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:19.880
 with the highest levels of adrenaline

1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:22.280
 have the highest levels of complicated grief symptoms

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:26.160
 post-treatment, but the predictive relationship

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:29.000
 between these two things, adrenaline and complicated grief,

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.560
 was not seen in depression.

1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:32.400
 And I find that incredibly interesting

1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:35.560
 because it further separates depression from grieving

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:37.360
 and grieving from depression.

1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:39.160
 A resounding theme again and again,

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:40.360
 grieving is not depression

1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:42.480
 and depression is not necessarily grieving.

1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:45.920
 They can co-exist, but they are separable as well

1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:50.240
 and indeed reflect separate brain circuitries entirely.

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:52.080
 So the conclusion they draw is that the present study

1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:54.280
 supports the hypothesis that catecholamine levels,

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.480
 again, epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine,

1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:58.800
 are the catecholamines, are affected by bereavement

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:01.200
 and in turn can affect the ability of those

1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:03.880
 with complicated grief to benefit from psychotherapy.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:04.720
 So what does all this mean?

1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:08.040
 What this means is we can prepare ourselves

1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:11.320
 to be in a better state to access,

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:14.060
 yes, access grief when it's appropriate.

1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:17.080
 And indeed grief is the appropriate response

1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:19.480
 when we lose someone, an animal or a thing

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:21.200
 that we are closely attached to.

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:25.620
 And yet to be able to move through that at a pace

1:24:25.620 --> 1:24:29.280
 and in a way that is most adaptive for us.

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:31.660
 And to just again highlight what adaptive means,

1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:34.400
 it does not mean dissociating from the attachment

1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:36.020
 to the person, animal or thing.

1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:38.480
 I just want to pause for a second

1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:43.480
 and mention why I keep repeating person, animal or thing.

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:49.160
 I'm saying that because while grieving the loss of a person

1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:51.800
 or a relationship with a person doesn't have to be

1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:55.120
 through death, of course, but death or otherwise

1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:57.320
 is something that we all can intuitively understand

1:24:57.320 --> 1:24:59.760
 even if we haven't experienced it.

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:03.080
 We are capable of achieving great attachments

1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:04.920
 to animals as well.

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:07.780
 And while the loss of a thing of an object

1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:11.160
 in no way, shape or form approximately

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:12.960
 the loss of a person or an animal,

1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:15.120
 I would never suggest that it does.

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:17.600
 It would also be naive and unfair of me

1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:19.880
 or anyone else to suggest that things can't hold

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:22.880
 immense importance to us and that the loss of them

1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:26.660
 can feel quite significant and invoke the grieving process.

1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:28.480
 This isn't always about materialism.

1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:31.400
 Sometimes it's purely about the sentimental attachment.

1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:34.040
 So for instance, the loss of a wedding ring

1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:36.840
 or an engagement ring that was very meaningful to you

1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:39.800
 or an article of clothing or a painting

1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:43.320
 or even a small, seemingly an important object

1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:45.120
 to somebody else, but something that held great meaning

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:48.080
 to you, maybe a seashell that you collected with somebody

1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:51.040
 on the beach and then somehow it gets lost.

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:53.620
 And it's the relationship with that person

1:25:53.620 --> 1:25:55.680
 that's contained within that object for you

1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:59.600
 as a representation within that object that's important.

1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:03.060
 That's the reason why I keep saying person, animal or thing.

1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:06.120
 I think it's only fair to include things in that category.

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.640
 But of course, with the understanding that they don't hold

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:13.160
 the absolute same magnitude as the loss of a being.

1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:15.160
 One thing that we ought to consider for a moment

1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:18.360
 is whether or not the depth of attachment

1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:20.800
 that you have to somebody predicts how long it will take

1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:23.920
 for you to move through the loss of that person.

1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:25.360
 We often hear this.

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.560
 Actually, I can remember some years ago

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.800
 at the end of a relationship,

1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:32.200
 a friend and colleague of mine saying,

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.860
 for every year that you were together,

1:26:34.860 --> 1:26:38.080
 it's going to take you one month to get over that person.

1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.320
 And I thought, where in the world do those data come from?

1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:45.200
 And this is what I call anic data or collective data,

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:48.080
 where this is like phrases such as,

1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:50.160
 absence makes the heart grow fonder.

1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:52.360
 And indeed, sometimes absence can make the heart grow

1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:55.280
 fonder in the context of two living people

1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:57.220
 or people in a loving relationship,

1:26:57.220 --> 1:26:59.600
 or even in the context of grief and loss.

1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:02.360
 But of course, there's absence makes the heart grow fonder.

1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:05.280
 And then you also will hear out of sight, out of mind.

1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:08.160
 And if you've been listening to this episode,

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.800
 clearly out of sight does not mean out of mind

1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:13.600
 or out of emotional connection.

1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:16.680
 So these sayings of, well, it takes X number of months

1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:18.780
 for a number of years, or out of sight, out of mind,

1:27:18.780 --> 1:27:21.120
 or absence makes the heart grow fonder.

1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:22.680
 They really don't hold a lot of meaning,

1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:25.300
 at least not for somebody like me who likes science,

1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:28.840
 because science is at least geared toward

1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:32.360
 or aims towards establishing things in fact, not opinion,

1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.920
 but also because science allows you to make predictions.

1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:38.600
 It allows you to orient yourself in a process

1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:41.200
 and make predictions and understand.

1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:43.600
 So what are we to think of people

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:47.060
 who seem very, very attached to somebody,

1:27:47.060 --> 1:27:50.000
 they break up and they seem just crushed, devastated,

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.080
 but three weeks later, they're in a new relationship

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:53.480
 and they seem perfectly fine.

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:57.040
 Or somebody whose spouse dies

1:27:57.040 --> 1:27:59.360
 and then suddenly they're in a new relationship.

1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:02.260
 I think there are rates of transition, if you will,

1:28:02.260 --> 1:28:06.480
 that suggests some dysfunction, pathology, et cetera.

1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:08.640
 But here we aren't in a position to judge,

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:11.360
 we're only in a position to speculate about this.

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:14.000
 And I think we can reasonably speculate

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.300
 that it sort of makes sense

1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:20.260
 why someone who has an intense attachment to somebody

1:28:20.260 --> 1:28:24.160
 might be able to form intense attachments generally, right?

1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:25.500
 That they aren't restricted to one person,

1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:27.700
 whereas other people who have an intense attachment

1:28:27.700 --> 1:28:30.520
 to somebody might find themselves entirely incapable

1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:33.200
 of moving on, or it would take them a very long time.

1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:36.280
 Hence the lines in the Feynman letter to Arlene

1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:40.000
 about he had met various other young women,

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000
 they seem perfectly nice,

1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.660
 and yet they were meaningless to him

1:28:43.660 --> 1:28:46.440
 in the shadow of her memory,

1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:48.640
 or we should say in the light of Arlene's memory

1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.480
 or the memory of Arlene rather.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:54.500
 So these dimensionalities of attachment,

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:56.480
 they cut in every direction.

1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:59.420
 And I don't think any well-trained psychologist

1:28:59.420 --> 1:29:01.220
 or neuroscientist would ever say,

1:29:01.220 --> 1:29:03.840
 oh, if you are somebody who becomes very attached,

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:05.640
 therefore it's very hard to move on.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:06.560
 I think that could be true.

1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:07.800
 It could also be that if you're somebody

1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:09.360
 who has a great capacity for attachment,

1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.360
 you have a great capacity for attachment overall.

1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:14.400
 Neuroscience nor psychology

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:17.120
 is really in a position to judge, certainly,

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:18.580
 but it's also not in a position

1:29:18.580 --> 1:29:19.740
 to make those kinds of predictions.

1:29:19.740 --> 1:29:22.840
 At least the field as it stands right now

1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:24.320
 of attachment and grieving

1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:27.360
 can't really speak to why that's the case.

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.040
 So that's my attempt to de-pathologize

1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:31.500
 some of what we observe,

1:29:31.500 --> 1:29:34.880
 although I have to confess from a just sort of

1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:37.680
 everyday stance that sometimes the rate

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:40.640
 in which people move out of attachments and grieving

1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:42.160
 can be somewhat eerie.

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.960
 I'd like to take a moment and explore this idea

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:47.400
 that allowing ourselves to really feel

1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:50.040
 the attachment to somebody can accelerate

1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:53.580
 or at least support adaptive transitioning through grief.

1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:59.000
 There's a really wonderful study that on the face of it

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.860
 appears to be what we call negative result.

1:30:01.860 --> 1:30:04.720
 A negative result is when a hypothesis is posed

1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:07.680
 and then turns out the hypothesis is not true.

1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:09.480
 But as is the case with so many

1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:11.080
 interesting scientific findings,

1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:13.960
 often when there's a negative result,

1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:15.280
 there's a more interesting result

1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:17.260
 nested in that negative outcome.

1:30:17.260 --> 1:30:19.620
 And this is the case in a particular paper

1:30:19.620 --> 1:30:20.460
 I'll share with you now.

1:30:20.460 --> 1:30:21.500
 There's a paper published in the journal

1:30:21.500 --> 1:30:23.360
 Biological Psychology.

1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:26.340
 And again, the title is posed as a question,

1:30:26.340 --> 1:30:29.720
 which is emotional disclosure for whom?

1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:32.520
 A study of vagal tone in bereavement.

1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:34.640
 What this study explored was

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:36.880
 whether or not written disclosure

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:39.880
 of the emotional connection to somebody that was lost

1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:42.540
 would be effective as a way for people

1:30:42.540 --> 1:30:45.380
 to move through the grieving process.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.320
 The study also explored the so-called vagus nerve.

1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:51.860
 The vagus nerve is an extensive nerve pathway

1:30:51.860 --> 1:30:54.040
 that is bi-directional between brain and body.

1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:56.540
 So brain to body and body to brain.

1:30:56.540 --> 1:30:59.960
 It generally is associated with calming effects

1:30:59.960 --> 1:31:00.900
 on our brain and body,

1:31:00.900 --> 1:31:03.880
 although that's certainly not always the case.

1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:04.800
 The way to think about it

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:07.440
 in terms of what we're going to talk about now

1:31:07.440 --> 1:31:10.480
 is heart rate and heart rate variability.

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:12.460
 And in very simplistic terms,

1:31:13.540 --> 1:31:15.700
 if your heart was just allowed to beat

1:31:15.700 --> 1:31:17.980
 at its sort of default rate,

1:31:17.980 --> 1:31:20.360
 that rate would be rather high

1:31:20.360 --> 1:31:23.320
 because of the activation of the so-called sympathetic arm

1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:24.520
 of the autonomic nervous system,

1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:28.600
 the alertness component of the autonomic nervous system.

1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:32.760
 The parasympathetic nervous system as it's called

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:33.760
 involves calming.

1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:36.080
 We sometimes hear sympathetic is for stress

1:31:36.080 --> 1:31:37.460
 or fight or flight.

1:31:37.460 --> 1:31:39.280
 It's for a lot of other things as well, I should mention,

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:40.820
 and it is not for sympathy.

1:31:40.820 --> 1:31:42.120
 Simpa simply means together,

1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:43.960
 and it reflects the activity of a bunch of neurons

1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:47.280
 being active at the same time or together, simpa.

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:49.840
 Whereas parasympathetic is often associated

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:52.220
 with quote unquote rest and digest functions

1:31:52.220 --> 1:31:53.240
 or calming functions,

1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:55.520
 although it is certainly involved in other things as well.

1:31:55.520 --> 1:31:58.420
 So sympathetic nervous system drives alertness,

1:31:58.420 --> 1:32:00.800
 panic, stress, et cetera.

1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:02.080
 Parasympathetic nervous system,

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:04.940
 meaning a distinct set of neurons drive calming,

1:32:04.940 --> 1:32:07.640
 falling asleep, digestion,

1:32:07.640 --> 1:32:10.920
 sexual arousal for that matter, and so on.

1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:13.360
 So you sort of like a seesaw of alertness and calm,

1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:14.200
 alertness and calm,

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:16.740
 sympathetic and parasympathetic, back and forth.

1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:19.160
 The vagus nerve is generally associated

1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:21.120
 with parasympathetic functions

1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:24.980
 and has the capacity to slow down our heart rate,

1:32:24.980 --> 1:32:27.520
 in particular by exhales.

1:32:27.520 --> 1:32:29.800
 And just simply because of the movement of the diaphragm

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:32.460
 and its relationship to the heart and the thoracic cavity,

1:32:32.460 --> 1:32:36.360
 exhales result in slowing down of the heart rate.

1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:41.160
 This is what we call an increased vagal tone.

1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:43.120
 So let me explain for a moment.

1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:44.400
 And actually here's a tool you can use,

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:46.240
 not just in terms of navigating grief,

1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:48.720
 but in terms of stress modulation generally.

1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:50.560
 We have a muscle called the diaphragm.

1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:53.680
 When we inhale, whether or not it's through our mouth

1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:56.440
 or nose, our diaphragm moves down.

1:32:57.300 --> 1:32:59.760
 As a consequence, there is more space overall

1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:01.040
 in the thoracic cavity.

1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:02.680
 The heart gets a little bit bigger,

1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:04.280
 believe it or not, volume-wise.

1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:08.800
 Blood flows more slowly through that large volume.

1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:11.440
 And there's a signal conveyed from the nervous system

1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:13.460
 to the heart to speed the heart up.

1:33:13.460 --> 1:33:15.400
 So inhales literally speed your heart up.

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:19.560
 And when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:20.720
 And as a consequence,

1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:22.480
 there's less space in the thoracic cavity.

1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:24.860
 Heart gets a little bit smaller.

1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:26.780
 The existing blood volume in the heart at that time

1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:28.960
 moves more quickly through that small volume, right?

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:30.180
 Given amount of blood volume,

1:33:30.180 --> 1:33:32.720
 make the compartment it's in the heart smaller,

1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:35.040
 and the blood moves more quickly through that volume.

1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:37.600
 And as a consequence, the nervous system sends a signal

1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:41.040
 to the heart via the vagus and other pathways

1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:42.380
 to slow the heart down.

1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:44.560
 In other words, exhale, slow the heart down.

1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:47.200
 That process, that relationship between inhale,

1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.900
 speeding the heart up and exhale, slowing the heart down

1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:52.660
 is something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:56.720
 Some people are able to engage respiratory sinus arrhythmia

1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:59.080
 more naturally, more reflexively than others.

1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:01.600
 You can actually train this by consciously thinking

1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:04.080
 about slowing your heart rate while you exhale

1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:06.920
 and consciously thinking about increasing your heart rate

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:07.760
 as you inhale.

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:10.240
 You can literally strengthen these pathways.

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:13.160
 Now, respiratory sinus arrhythmia

1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:16.680
 and the ability to slow your heart rate with exhales

1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:19.640
 is one dimension of what's called vagal tone

1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:22.720
 or your ability to control your overall level

1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:25.240
 of activation of alertness and stress

1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:27.800
 with these vagus nerve pathways.

1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:29.600
 So vagal tone is something that varies

1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:30.460
 from person to person.

1:34:30.460 --> 1:34:32.240
 If you've trained up or you've thought about

1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:34.160
 your relationship between breath and heart rate,

1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:36.320
 you can improve vagal tone.

1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:39.400
 Some people have very robust vagal tone

1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:40.720
 without having done any training.

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.660
 Other people have less of it, et cetera.

1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:46.040
 I'll just paraphrase from this paper

1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:47.440
 and you'll see where this takes us

1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:50.600
 in terms of navigating grief because it's quite important.

1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:53.020
 The vagus nerve provides inhibitory regulatory influence

1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:55.940
 on the heart, allowing the heart rate to increase rapidly

1:34:55.940 --> 1:34:56.900
 through vagal withdrawal.

1:34:56.900 --> 1:34:59.120
 That means kind of coming off the brake

1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.000
 of the parasympathetic nervous system

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.900
 as in response to a stressor in one's environment, right?

1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:06.600
 When you're stressed, you rarely take the opportunity

1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:09.880
 if it's an immediate stress or threat to actively exhale.

1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:11.140
 That would be a great tool to use.

1:35:11.140 --> 1:35:12.280
 In fact, we promote that tool

1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:14.560
 in our Mastering Stress episode.

1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:16.160
 Vagal withdrawal usually co-occurs

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:18.220
 with an increase in sympathetic activation of the heart.

1:35:18.220 --> 1:35:19.760
 You now know what that is

1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:21.320
 or is known as the fight or flight response.

1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:24.820
 Vagal tone reflects the degree to which there is tonic,

1:35:24.820 --> 1:35:28.480
 meaning ongoing, vagal influence on the heart.

1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.060
 So when you have a high degree of vagal tone,

1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:36.640
 it means that you are always activating that brake

1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.840
 on your stress system, just at default.

1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:40.240
 And some people just happen to do that more.

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:42.640
 Other people need to practice long exhale breathing

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:45.040
 in order to build up vagal tone,

1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:46.960
 something that's very useful to do

1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:48.880
 whether you're grieving or not.

1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:50.240
 Now, in this study, what they did

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:54.500
 is they had people, and I should say it was 35 participants,

1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:58.460
 go through a writing exercise for a period of weeks.

1:35:58.460 --> 1:36:00.860
 They actually wrote about three times per week.

1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:02.920
 Then there was a follow-up at some period of time

1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:04.440
 and then again about a month later.

1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:06.800
 And there were two different groups.

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:09.860
 One group was in the so-called written disclosure group.

1:36:09.860 --> 1:36:12.320
 What they did is they, on day one,

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:16.180
 they would write about what happened when a loved one died.

1:36:16.180 --> 1:36:19.480
 And indeed they used people who had experienced real loss.

1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:21.680
 And so they were asked to talk about

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:24.240
 and write about their deepest emotions

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:26.860
 and thoughts about it, memories of their loved one,

1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:28.680
 very intense stuff if you think about it,

1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:31.600
 if they're in the immediate period of having lost someone.

1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:33.780
 Then they actually were asked to write a letter

1:36:33.780 --> 1:36:35.200
 to the person that they lost.

1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:39.060
 So again, a very intense exercise to go through

1:36:39.060 --> 1:36:42.200
 if you did indeed lose somebody as these subjects had.

1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:43.620
 And then of course there was the testing

1:36:43.620 --> 1:36:45.060
 some period of time later.

1:36:45.060 --> 1:36:48.720
 And I'll tell you what that testing involved.

1:36:49.940 --> 1:36:51.680
 The other group was a so-called control group

1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:53.220
 where they were simply told to write

1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:54.500
 about how they use their time.

1:36:54.500 --> 1:36:56.940
 So an emotionally kind of empty writing exercise,

1:36:56.940 --> 1:36:57.780
 if you will.

1:36:57.780 --> 1:36:59.060
 They described what they would do today

1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:00.540
 after they woke up, et cetera.

1:37:00.540 --> 1:37:03.420
 No heavy emotional content and so on.

1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:05.900
 Now, as I mentioned earlier,

1:37:05.900 --> 1:37:09.680
 the immediate results of this study were a negative result,

1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:11.700
 meaning no effect.

1:37:11.700 --> 1:37:13.240
 The disclosure that we should say

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.000
 the emotionally intense writing group

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.980
 and the control group did not differ at baseline

1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:18.260
 on any symptom measures

1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:20.300
 or psychological variables they tell us.

1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:24.740
 And at least at face value, somewhat disappointingly,

1:37:24.740 --> 1:37:28.420
 there really wasn't any kind of difference in outcome

1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:30.060
 between the group that wrote

1:37:30.060 --> 1:37:31.940
 about a very emotionally intense stuff

1:37:31.940 --> 1:37:33.660
 versus non-emotionally intense.

1:37:33.660 --> 1:37:35.840
 Now, what I didn't tell you thus far

1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:38.500
 is why they had them do this exercise at all.

1:37:38.500 --> 1:37:39.740
 They had them do this exercise

1:37:39.740 --> 1:37:41.760
 because many of the effective practices

1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:44.940
 for moving through grief involve, as I mentioned earlier,

1:37:44.940 --> 1:37:49.860
 getting close to and actually deliberately experiencing

1:37:49.860 --> 1:37:52.660
 the attachment that one has to that person that was lost,

1:37:52.660 --> 1:37:54.480
 not distracting oneself,

1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:56.900
 not getting into this counterfactual thinking,

1:37:56.900 --> 1:37:58.180
 the what if, what if, what if,

1:37:58.180 --> 1:38:00.420
 but rather thinking about, or in this case,

1:38:00.420 --> 1:38:02.540
 writing about the real attachment.

1:38:02.540 --> 1:38:04.820
 And so the initial idea was

1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:06.460
 if people write about this attachment,

1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:08.140
 that they're going to experience this attachment

1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:11.060
 and that will serve them in some or many ways

1:38:11.060 --> 1:38:12.980
 in terms of moving through grief.

1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:14.100
 And that wasn't what they found.

1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:15.940
 They found no difference between the two groups

1:38:15.940 --> 1:38:20.940
 until they explored who had higher vagal tone,

1:38:21.020 --> 1:38:23.180
 who had a greater degree

1:38:23.180 --> 1:38:25.540
 of so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:29.260
 In other words, who was able to modulate their state

1:38:29.260 --> 1:38:31.220
 using their breathing and their body.

1:38:31.220 --> 1:38:34.820
 And what they discovered was that a subset of individuals

1:38:34.820 --> 1:38:37.460
 who had a high degree of vagal tone

1:38:37.460 --> 1:38:41.620
 seemed to get more benefit from this writing type exercise.

1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:44.060
 Now, this is one study and I would consider it

1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:46.920
 fairly preliminary with 35 subjects.

1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:48.980
 Although, you know, it's a study into itself

1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:50.420
 and I think a quite nice one.

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:53.540
 And it really set the stage for a number of other studies

1:38:53.540 --> 1:38:55.820
 that followed from this group and other groups

1:38:55.820 --> 1:38:58.620
 that really point to the fact that yes, indeed,

1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:01.380
 accessing these states of emotionality

1:39:01.380 --> 1:39:04.340
 by writing or thinking about somebody is quite powerful

1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:07.460
 in terms of engaging the bodily states

1:39:07.460 --> 1:39:09.560
 and the mind states associated with the attachment.

1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:13.020
 And that is very beneficial for moving through grief.

1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:16.500
 That is very beneficial for sensing the attachment.

1:39:16.500 --> 1:39:19.420
 And now it makes perfect sense as to why some people

1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:21.960
 would benefit from that sort of practice more than others,

1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:24.300
 because some people are able to access

1:39:24.300 --> 1:39:27.740
 more real somatic feelings of attachment

1:39:27.740 --> 1:39:29.120
 by writing about the attachment

1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:31.100
 or by thinking about it than others.

1:39:31.100 --> 1:39:33.260
 So this brings us back to an earlier discussion

1:39:33.260 --> 1:39:35.660
 we were having where we were talking about

1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:37.900
 how some people seem to move through things very quickly

1:39:37.900 --> 1:39:40.080
 or don't seem to be grieving constantly.

1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:42.840
 And, you know, a spouse or a family member of that person

1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:44.620
 might think, gosh, why aren't you upset?

1:39:44.620 --> 1:39:46.860
 How is it that you can be functional and I'm not?

1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:48.100
 Or how is it that you can be functional?

1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:51.500
 There can even be fractures in families and relationships

1:39:51.500 --> 1:39:54.980
 on the basis of differences in rates of grieving and so on.

1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:57.780
 Well, some of this, again, probably relates to psychology

1:39:57.780 --> 1:39:59.360
 and the different attachments that people had

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:01.360
 to the person or animal or thing that was lost,

1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:04.200
 but it no doubt also has to do

1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.340
 with how much of a mind-body connection,

1:40:06.340 --> 1:40:10.020
 how much vagal tone exists in the person

1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:13.500
 when they suddenly found themselves in the grief episode.

1:40:13.500 --> 1:40:15.780
 So this actually offers multiple opportunities.

1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:17.360
 If you're somebody, for instance,

1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:20.900
 who is grieving so intensely and so often

1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:22.700
 that you're finding it immensely difficult

1:40:22.700 --> 1:40:25.260
 to move through grief at a reasonable rate,

1:40:25.260 --> 1:40:26.620
 and you might even say,

1:40:26.620 --> 1:40:29.140
 or find yourself diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder

1:40:29.140 --> 1:40:31.020
 or with complicated grief syndrome in a way

1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:35.840
 that's really impairing your adaptive functioning in life,

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:38.200
 well, then it's not clear to me,

1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:39.980
 at least by my read of the data,

1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:43.020
 that you would want to engage in a lot of practices

1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:45.080
 to increase the mind-body relationship

1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:46.900
 and feeling so much of this attachment

1:40:46.900 --> 1:40:48.940
 because you're already feeling an immense amount of it.

1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:52.740
 Whereas other people who are feeling challenged

1:40:52.740 --> 1:40:55.720
 in accessing the feelings of attachment

1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:59.340
 and perhaps not functioning well as a consequence of that

1:40:59.340 --> 1:41:02.100
 might find that practicing breathing

1:41:02.100 --> 1:41:05.380
 in order to encourage respiratory signs of arrhythmia,

1:41:05.380 --> 1:41:08.360
 again, focusing on slowing your heart rate consciously

1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:10.400
 while you exhale and concentrating

1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:12.660
 on increasing your heart rate as you inhale,

1:41:12.660 --> 1:41:13.940
 even just as a brief practice

1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:15.540
 of even just one to three minutes

1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:18.620
 or one to five minutes every once in a while or per day,

1:41:18.620 --> 1:41:19.980
 that could be immensely beneficial

1:41:19.980 --> 1:41:21.600
 in building this mind-body relationship.

1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.700
 Because again, what this paper really points to

1:41:23.700 --> 1:41:26.980
 and set off a number of other investigations related to

1:41:26.980 --> 1:41:30.600
 is that for those that can really feel the relationship

1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:34.060
 between breathing, heart rate, what we call vagal tone,

1:41:34.060 --> 1:41:37.340
 well, those people are going to be in a better position

1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:38.180
 to move through grief,

1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:40.500
 not because they are disengaging

1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:42.040
 from the feelings of attachment,

1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:44.300
 but because they are better able to access

1:41:44.300 --> 1:41:45.820
 those feelings of attachment.

1:41:45.820 --> 1:41:49.580
 So what this relates to, of course, is that tripartite map,

1:41:49.580 --> 1:41:52.500
 that three-part map that we talked about earlier,

1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:55.740
 that representation of space, where things are,

1:41:55.740 --> 1:41:57.540
 where the person is, where their belongings are,

1:41:57.540 --> 1:41:59.820
 where their car is, where their bicycle is,

1:41:59.820 --> 1:42:02.560
 time, when you were expecting to see them

1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:05.220
 on a regular basis, when they would call,

1:42:05.220 --> 1:42:07.580
 when they would come home from work, et cetera,

1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:10.720
 and that third node or that third dimension of attachment,

1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:13.660
 which is literally attachment and closeness.

1:42:13.660 --> 1:42:16.220
 Well, what we're talking about here is anchoring

1:42:16.220 --> 1:42:18.460
 to that attachment and really feeling into that,

1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:23.060
 but then disengaging from the space and time map

1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:24.500
 that we call episodic memory,

1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:28.340
 that menu of prior experiences that keeps us in many ways

1:42:28.340 --> 1:42:32.940
 maladaptively in an expectation of what never can be again.

1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:35.620
 Now I'd like to take a moment and consider some of the tools

1:42:35.620 --> 1:42:38.660
 that you can access that support healthy transitioning

1:42:38.660 --> 1:42:41.020
 through grief, and these are tools distinct

1:42:41.020 --> 1:42:42.180
 from that neural map,

1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:44.420
 that space, time, closeness attachment map

1:42:44.420 --> 1:42:46.160
 that we were talking about before.

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:48.460
 Rather, it's important to remind ourselves

1:42:48.460 --> 1:42:52.100
 that everything exists in a context

1:42:52.100 --> 1:42:54.180
 of our baseline physiology,

1:42:54.180 --> 1:42:56.820
 and I'm certainly not going to be the first or the last

1:42:56.820 --> 1:43:00.540
 to tell you that everything in life, learning relationships

1:43:00.540 --> 1:43:02.360
 with people that are still around,

1:43:03.940 --> 1:43:06.020
 our health in every way, immune system, et cetera,

1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:08.900
 function far better when we're sleeping really well,

1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.140
 and when we are generally awake during the daytime

1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:13.520
 and asleep at night.

1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:15.420
 I realize there are shift workers out there,

1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:17.680
 people who are traveling and are jet lagged.

1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:20.640
 First of all, thank you, shift workers, we rely on you.

1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:23.600
 We have an episode all about jet lag and shift work for you

1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:26.400
 and for trying to maintain the best possible mental

1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:28.780
 and physical health in the face of ongoing shift work

1:43:28.780 --> 1:43:29.620
 and jet lag.

1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:31.080
 You can find that episode on our website,

1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:33.860
 hubramalab.com, lots of behavioral tools,

1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:35.180
 some other tools as well.

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:39.480
 Nonetheless, human beings are diurnal.

1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:42.640
 We were really designed to be awake mostly in the day

1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:43.960
 and asleep at night.

1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:45.560
 There are rare exceptions to this where people like

1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:46.840
 to stay up late and sleep in late,

1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.800
 but we are a diurnal species by way of our genetic wiring

1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:54.560
 and our neural circuit wiring.

1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:57.320
 There's a particular feature to our diurnal,

1:43:57.320 --> 1:43:59.560
 and diurnal meaning the opposite of nocturnal,

1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:03.680
 our diurnal pattern of the release of a hormone

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:04.840
 called cortisol.

1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:07.660
 Cortisol is a stress hormone, it's sometimes called,

1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:09.940
 but cortisol has a lot of other effects,

1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:10.880
 many of which are positive.

1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:14.120
 Cortisol, for instance, protects us against infection.

1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:17.140
 It can help us in terms of waking up in the morning.

1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:19.480
 In fact, the pulse as it's called,

1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:21.880
 or the spike in cortisol early in the day

1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:23.240
 is part of the reason we wake up.

1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:26.200
 It's linked to our increase in temperature rhythms

1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.000
 and can further increase our temperature,

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:30.600
 which leads to waking and so on.

1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:34.360
 The typical pattern of cortisol in a healthy individual,

1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:36.400
 and we really can say physically

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:38.500
 and emotionally healthy individual,

1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:41.360
 is that cortisol is going to be somewhat high

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:42.760
 right around waking,

1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:46.120
 and then is going to be highest as it ever will be

1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:50.040
 in the 24 hour period, about 45 minutes post waking.

1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:52.760
 Not exactly 45 minutes, but about 45 minutes.

1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:55.440
 And then it will drop gradually,

1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:58.200
 such that by about 4 p.m. in the afternoon,

1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:00.200
 which is actually when body temperature

1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:02.360
 tends to start to drop as well,

1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:04.080
 cortisol tends to be very low,

1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:07.160
 and then remains low in a healthy individual,

1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:09.720
 such that at 9 p.m. it's very low,

1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:12.020
 and throughout the night as we sleep, it's very low.

1:45:12.020 --> 1:45:16.740
 In fact, spikes or pulses in 9 p.m. cortisol

1:45:16.740 --> 1:45:20.360
 are a fairly reliable biomarker readout

1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:23.100
 of certain forms of depression and chronic anxiety.

1:45:23.100 --> 1:45:25.200
 This relates to the beautiful work of my colleagues

1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:26.880
 at Stanford and Stanford School of Medicine,

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:28.960
 Dr. David Spiegel, who's been on this podcast,

1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:33.480
 and Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who has also been on this podcast.

1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:36.560
 There's a very interesting paper

1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:40.300
 exploring the relationship between cortisol rhythms

1:45:40.300 --> 1:45:42.280
 and grieving, in particular,

1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:44.480
 complicated versus non-complicated grieving.

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:46.380
 Again, complicated grieving being the form of grieving

1:45:46.380 --> 1:45:49.440
 that reflects a immense challenge

1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:51.040
 to people moving through the grieving process

1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:54.480
 such that it really needs to be dealt with, right?

1:45:54.480 --> 1:45:55.720
 Again, grieving is healthy,

1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:58.160
 but complicated grieving is a prolonged grieving

1:45:58.160 --> 1:45:59.600
 and has other dimensions as well,

1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:00.880
 hence the name complicated.

1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:02.820
 The title of this paper is

1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:06.540
 Diurnal Cortisol in Complicated and Non-complicated Grief,

1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:09.080
 Slope Differences Across the Day.

1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:11.800
 And the figure to orient to in this paper,

1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:14.080
 if you do decide to check it out,

1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:15.600
 and we'll put a link to it,

1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:19.220
 is figure one, which beautifully shows,

1:46:19.220 --> 1:46:21.680
 or I should say very clearly shows,

1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:26.120
 that in individuals that are experiencing complicated grief,

1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:28.080
 there's the same general contour

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:30.080
 of high cortisol upon waking,

1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:32.640
 even higher about 45 minutes after waking,

1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:35.300
 and then a reduction in cortisol by 4 p.m.

1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:37.280
 and even further reduction by 9 p.m.,

1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:39.760
 so just as it were in a typical individual

1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:42.620
 or somebody who is in non-complicated grieving.

1:46:42.620 --> 1:46:45.340
 However, when you compare the cortisol levels

1:46:45.340 --> 1:46:48.040
 between people experiencing complicated grieving

1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:49.740
 versus non-complicated grieving,

1:46:49.740 --> 1:46:54.000
 what you find is the 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. cortisol levels

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:55.900
 are significantly higher

1:46:55.900 --> 1:46:59.560
 than they are in the non-complicated grieving group.

1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:02.020
 This raises a very interesting idea

1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:03.520
 and relates very closely

1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:06.120
 to what we were talking about with vagal tone.

1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:07.680
 You could imagine a situation

1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:11.400
 in which people who are experiencing complicated grief

1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:14.880
 have higher levels of afternoon and nighttime cortisol

1:47:14.880 --> 1:47:17.280
 because they are in complicated grief,

1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:19.280
 but you could also imagine the opposite,

1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:21.720
 that they're experiencing complicated grief

1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:24.960
 because of the fact that they have elevated cortisol.

1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:27.820
 Now, it's very likely that it's bi-directional,

1:47:27.820 --> 1:47:31.200
 that the answer isn't one or the other, but both,

1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:34.600
 that complicated grief changes patterns of cortisol

1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:37.260
 and that patterns of cortisol change the likelihood

1:47:37.260 --> 1:47:39.880
 that one has complicated grief.

1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:43.080
 That's the most logical interpretation of data like these.

1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:47.320
 However, when taken along with the data on vagal tone,

1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:50.640
 that people who have a higher level of vagal tone

1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:54.480
 are better able to navigate situations

1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:56.120
 of the sort that we're talking about,

1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:00.020
 and that some people perhaps have oxytocin receptors

1:48:00.020 --> 1:48:02.740
 or patterns of catecholamines or epinephrine

1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:04.760
 that position them to be more likely to grieve

1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:06.040
 in a particular way,

1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:10.260
 we arrive at a scenario where it makes very good sense

1:48:10.260 --> 1:48:12.220
 to think about modulating,

1:48:12.220 --> 1:48:15.200
 that is controlling the foundation of your life

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:18.080
 in a way that establishes cortisol rhythms

1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:21.120
 and sleep patterns and patterns of autonomic arousal

1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:23.900
 and catecholamine release that position you

1:48:23.900 --> 1:48:28.020
 to navigate the grief process in the best possible way.

1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:30.400
 If that was a complicated mouthful to digest,

1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:32.840
 let me restate it in a simpler way.

1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:36.040
 If you are somebody who is heading into grief

1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:39.000
 or is challenged with grief, complicated grief or otherwise,

1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.960
 prolonged grief or otherwise,

1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:44.280
 getting adequate sleep at night

1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:49.280
 and establishing as normal a pattern of cortisol as possible

1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:51.240
 is going to be very important.

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:53.600
 And there's a very simple, straightforward way to do this.

1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:56.160
 And I apologize to the listeners of this podcast in advance

1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:57.520
 if I sound like a repeating record,

1:48:57.520 --> 1:48:59.940
 but the most powerful way to do this

1:48:59.940 --> 1:49:03.980
 is to view sunlight very close to waking.

1:49:03.980 --> 1:49:05.640
 It does not have to be right at sunrise,

1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:09.500
 but when you get up in the morning, if the sun isn't out,

1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:13.120
 please turn on as many bright lights as possible

1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:14.120
 in your environment.

1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:16.480
 And then once the sun is out,

1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:18.840
 try and get some bright sunlight in your eyes.

1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:21.240
 Never look at any light so bright

1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:24.000
 that it's painful to look at sunlight or otherwise.

1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:25.380
 If you live in an area of the world

1:49:25.380 --> 1:49:27.480
 where there isn't a lot of sunlight,

1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:29.660
 please keep in mind that sunlight coming through cloud cover

1:49:29.660 --> 1:49:32.260
 is going to still be a very effective mechanism

1:49:32.260 --> 1:49:33.940
 for establishing this cortisol rhythm.

1:49:33.940 --> 1:49:35.280
 Why do I say this thing about sunlight

1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:36.720
 over and over and over again?

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:39.680
 Well, having an early day cortisol peak

1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:43.800
 and a very low cortisol level late in the day,

1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:47.320
 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. is immensely beneficial.

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:50.980
 It reflects a properly regulated autonomic nervous system.

1:49:50.980 --> 1:49:52.280
 It means being alert during the day

1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:55.320
 and your ability to sleep at night is tightly correlated

1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:57.680
 to this viewing of sunlight in the morning.

1:49:57.680 --> 1:49:59.680
 If you have additional questions about this

1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:01.360
 or these protocols,

1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:03.680
 please see our Mastering Sleep episode

1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:04.980
 also at hubermanlab.com.

1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:07.860
 But in brief, you don't want to wear sunglasses

1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:08.700
 when you do this.

1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:11.760
 You do not want to do this through a window or a windshield.

1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:13.760
 It is 50 times less effective at least

1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:15.760
 because of filtering of the proper wavelengths.

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:18.120
 It is fine to wear eyeglasses,

1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:19.800
 meaning corrective lenses or contacts,

1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:21.440
 even if they have UV protection.

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:22.880
 Again, sunlight is best.

1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:24.240
 10 minutes to 30 minutes,

1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:25.600
 depending on how bright it is outside

1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:27.300
 and so on and so forth.

1:50:27.300 --> 1:50:28.760
 I keep coming back to this protocol

1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.480
 because first of all, it is a zero cost,

1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:35.500
 but very effective way to regulate things

1:50:35.500 --> 1:50:37.400
 like cortisol rhythms, melatonin rhythms,

1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:39.000
 wakefulness during the day,

1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.280
 ease of falling asleep at night and so on.

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:42.280
 And second of all,

1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:46.000
 because I want to emphasize this idea of modulation.

1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000
 There are processes in our brain and body

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.300
 which directly mediate some psychological effect

1:50:51.300 --> 1:50:53.320
 or physiological effect, right?

1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:55.960
 Dopamine is directly involved in motivation.

1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:58.520
 If you're somebody who struggles with motivation,

1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:00.820
 your dopamine system is likely to be dysregulated

1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:02.320
 in some way and there are behavioral tools

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:03.880
 and other tools to adjust that.

1:51:03.880 --> 1:51:06.240
 We had an episode on dopamine motivation and drive

1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:09.120
 that talks extensively about those tools.

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:13.100
 However, the process of grief can't be distilled down

1:51:13.100 --> 1:51:15.960
 to one molecule, one circuit such that we can say,

1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.540
 oh, you know, take this supplement or eat this diet

1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:20.840
 and or exercise in the following way

1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:23.540
 and you'll recover from grief more quickly.

1:51:23.540 --> 1:51:24.920
 It's simply not the case.

1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:27.840
 It is the case, however, that proper sleep at night

1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:32.240
 sets the foundation for the proper emotional tone

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:35.680
 to be able to navigate physical, psychological

1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:36.920
 and other types of challenges.

1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:40.800
 And not incidentally sleep at night,

1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:42.840
 I should say sufficient duration and quality

1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:44.400
 of sleep at night is the way

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:46.160
 in which you engage neuroplasticity,

1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:48.000
 the reordering of neural connections

1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.480
 and everything we've been talking about today

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:52.720
 about reordering of the maps in your mind,

1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:56.320
 this tripartite three-part map of space, time and closeness

1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:59.800
 involves neuroplasticity, the reconfiguring of connections

1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:02.040
 between neurons, strengthening certain pathways

1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:03.560
 and not strengthening others,

1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:07.120
 actively trying to disengage from the what if, right?

1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:08.320
 This counterintuitive thinking,

1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:11.220
 actively trying to disengage from the expectations

1:52:11.220 --> 1:52:12.640
 that someone will be there.

1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:14.200
 Although when you find yourself doing that,

1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:18.400
 understanding why it's so reflexive and normal to do that,

1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:21.760
 actively trying to lean into the real attachment

1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:24.280
 to somebody, animal or thing.

1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:28.480
 And yet at the same time, not diluting yourself

1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:30.920
 and undermining the whole process of grieving

1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:32.740
 by trying to imagine that they are in fact

1:52:32.740 --> 1:52:34.680
 still truly there, right?

1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:38.240
 It's a very narrow knife edge of a process,

1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:40.400
 which is why it's so challenging.

1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:41.920
 Regulating your cortisol rhythm

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:44.280
 through viewing sunlight early in the day.

1:52:44.280 --> 1:52:46.560
 And I should also say avoiding bright lights

1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:49.360
 from artificial sources in the evening,

1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:51.040
 generally 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.

1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:54.520
 But certainly in the evening, trying to dim lights

1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:56.020
 in your immediate environment,

1:52:56.020 --> 1:52:57.640
 trying to avoid bright screens,

1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.920
 bright artificial lights as much as possible

1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:01.520
 and accessing that deep sleep.

1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:05.580
 That's modulating, it's setting an overall autonomic state

1:53:05.580 --> 1:53:08.360
 or an overall autonomic landscape

1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:10.200
 would be the better way to describe it.

1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:12.600
 That's going to allow you to sleep and get neuroplasticity,

1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:14.340
 sleep and be in the best emotional state

1:53:14.340 --> 1:53:15.780
 to navigate the grieving process.

1:53:15.780 --> 1:53:19.240
 Because it's only fair to say that the grieving process

1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:21.720
 as we're describing it is hard

1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:23.480
 and not just because it's emotionally hard,

1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:24.960
 it's cognitively hard.

1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:26.400
 You just think about what's required

1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:28.960
 to move through grief properly, if you will.

1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:33.560
 It's thinking about and actually physically experiencing

1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:37.580
 the depth, the full depth of the attachment to the person,

1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:39.480
 while at the same time trying to uncouple

1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:44.040
 from that rich menu, that catalog of episodic memories

1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:45.680
 that can date back many, many years

1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:46.840
 and have so much richness,

1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:49.940
 so many predictions form on the basis

1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:51.240
 of those episodic memories

1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:53.440
 and actively trying to distance ourselves

1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:55.920
 from those memories by being very anchored in the fact

1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.720
 that we are present, we are the person alone in that room

1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:02.280
 or in some cases with a bereavement group in that room

1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:04.440
 or with other people that are mourning the loss

1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:06.760
 of that individual animal or thing.

1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:11.760
 And that knife edge of feeling the intense attachment

1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:14.920
 while also disengaging from all the things

1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:17.080
 that led to that attachment,

1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:20.080
 well, it's understandable why that would be so challenging.

1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:22.520
 And it should also be understandable

1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:24.720
 why positioning yourself to be able to do that

1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:28.040
 in the best possible way requires proper sleep.

1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:30.640
 So what are the tools that we can think about using

1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:33.440
 in terms of healthy adaptive moving through grief,

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:35.280
 trying to avoid complicated grief

1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:38.480
 and prolonged grief disorders?

1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:41.040
 I realize that word disorder implies all sorts of things,

1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:44.080
 but again, those are just naming categorizations

1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:47.520
 that people come up with that I think fairly reflect

1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:50.000
 the fact that some people have more challenge moving

1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:51.840
 through grieving than others.

1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:54.120
 And for some people, it can be very extended.

1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:56.640
 I think the common misunderstanding

1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:00.000
 is that proper grieving involves moving

1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:01.080
 through something quickly.

1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:03.400
 We're certainly not saying that.

1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:07.160
 However, it is very clear that some people can get stuck

1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:09.280
 and that process of getting stuck,

1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:13.560
 you should now understand has a lot to do with maintaining

1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:15.720
 or reactivating those episodic memories,

1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:18.340
 those expectations of where somebody will be

1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:19.460
 in space and time.

1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.480
 So what can we say about the tools for moving through grief?

1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:27.320
 Clearly, it's a value to dedicate some period of time,

1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:29.760
 perhaps every day, perhaps every other day,

1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:32.180
 depending on your capacity and schedule.

1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:34.940
 These could be periods of time ranging anywhere

1:55:34.940 --> 1:55:37.320
 from five to 45 minutes, maybe longer.

1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:42.280
 These blocks of time would be appropriately described

1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:44.980
 as rational grieving, right?

1:55:44.980 --> 1:55:49.200
 Rational grieving is a clear acceptance of the new reality

1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:51.780
 that the person, animal, or thing no longer exists

1:55:51.780 --> 1:55:54.000
 in the same space-time dimensionality

1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:57.200
 that we knew them before, and yet holding onto

1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:00.120
 and anchoring to the attachment that we had.

1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:02.560
 This is, again, not an unhealthy anchoring

1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:03.880
 to the attachment.

1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:06.600
 This is really anchoring to the depth and the intensity

1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.060
 of the attachment that existed as a way to,

1:56:10.060 --> 1:56:12.660
 for lack of a better way to put it,

1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:15.480
 push off from those episodic memories,

1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:16.880
 to distance ourselves from them,

1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:19.900
 because those episodic memories are the ones that lead us

1:56:19.900 --> 1:56:22.840
 to look for the person in our current reality.

1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:25.480
 And assuming this is a real and complete loss,

1:56:26.340 --> 1:56:28.820
 those sorts of expectations are maladaptive.

1:56:28.820 --> 1:56:30.260
 They do not serve us well.

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:34.320
 The second aspect of this is to understand

1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:36.160
 that the node of the map,

1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:40.160
 the component of the neural map that you're anchoring to

1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:41.720
 is a very real component of you.

1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:42.760
 These are literally cells

1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:45.120
 that represent the depth of attachment.

1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.480
 They are linked up with your emotional centers in the brain,

1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:49.520
 and indeed they're linked up with your body.

1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:51.960
 I think one of the things that comes up so often

1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:54.960
 when people are grieving is why does it hurt so much?

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:57.600
 Well, that hurt is that yearning.

1:56:57.600 --> 1:57:01.200
 It's that anticipation of action that you want to engage in,

1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:04.840
 but some part of you at least knows that it leads nowhere.

1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:06.640
 It's that reaching for that glass of water

1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:09.280
 in a kind of desert of thirst,

1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:11.020
 and you know you can't have it.

1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:12.120
 That's why it hurts so badly

1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:14.400
 because the systems of your brain and body

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:17.720
 are in a place of anticipation of readiness.

1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:21.500
 And given the activation of these brain reward systems

1:57:21.500 --> 1:57:22.960
 like the nucleus accumbens,

1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:25.400
 given your now understanding of oxytocin

1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:28.000
 being more enriched in the, excuse me,

1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.440
 in the nucleus accumbens of some individuals

1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:33.340
 and as opposed to others,

1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:35.920
 it should make perfect sense as to why it's so painful

1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:37.480
 in your body.

1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:39.120
 We talked a moment ago about the importance

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:42.320
 of accessing quality sleep on a regular basis,

1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:43.960
 gave you at least one tool to do that.

1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:46.800
 There, again, a rich array of tools to do that

1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:48.440
 in the Mastering Sleep episode.

1:57:48.440 --> 1:57:51.280
 And again, highlighting the importance of sleep

1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:54.840
 for not just emotion regulation and autonomic control,

1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:56.840
 which is so vital, but also for making sure

1:57:56.840 --> 1:57:58.420
 that neuroplasticity takes place,

1:57:58.420 --> 1:58:00.680
 because again, neuroplasticity is a two-part process.

1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:02.200
 There's the triggering of the plasticity,

1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:04.920
 which in the case of the things we're talking about today

1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:08.040
 will be naturally activated by the practice

1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:10.360
 of a dedicated focusing on the attachment,

1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:11.680
 feeling the attachment to the person,

1:58:11.680 --> 1:58:14.200
 maybe even writing about the attachment to the person

1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:16.400
 as was described in that previous study.

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:19.200
 But also just the plasticity is triggered

1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:21.740
 by the mere loss of that person,

1:58:21.740 --> 1:58:23.100
 the intensity of that experience.

1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:26.260
 But neuroplasticity, the literal rewiring of connections

1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:28.460
 occurs during deep sleep

1:58:28.460 --> 1:58:31.360
 and in what I call non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.

1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:32.840
 And you can find NSDR scripts.

1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:35.480
 These are short behavioral protocols that you do

1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:37.740
 for 10 to 30 minutes at some point throughout the day,

1:58:37.740 --> 1:58:38.960
 maybe even multiple times a day

1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:41.860
 that have been shown to accelerate neuroplasticity.

1:58:43.180 --> 1:58:45.640
 So having such a practice can be very useful

1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:48.880
 and understand that it involves some cognitive work.

1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:50.480
 We have to hold onto the attachment

1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:53.560
 and imagine and feel as much as we can the attachment

1:58:53.560 --> 1:58:57.400
 while also being extremely rationally grounded

1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:01.500
 and trying to not try to hold onto the past,

1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:04.460
 trying to not anticipate the person walking in the room.

1:59:04.460 --> 1:59:05.480
 This is very hard

1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:07.600
 because when we think about the attachment,

1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:10.300
 the attachment tends to drag with it

1:59:10.300 --> 1:59:13.720
 those episodic memories, that rich catalog of experiences.

1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:15.640
 The expectation that they will walk in the room

1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:17.300
 is perfectly natural.

1:59:17.300 --> 1:59:19.180
 The hard cognitive work

1:59:19.180 --> 1:59:23.160
 is to experience the deep emotional attachment

1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:25.580
 while at the same time severing from

1:59:25.580 --> 1:59:28.840
 or distancing ourselves from these expectations

1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:30.720
 that they'll suddenly show up in our reality

1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:32.180
 when in fact they won't.

1:59:33.580 --> 1:59:36.840
 And we talked about preparing ourselves for grief, right?

1:59:36.840 --> 1:59:39.280
 If we have a loved one that's dying

1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:41.360
 or we anticipate that at some point

1:59:41.360 --> 1:59:43.700
 we are going to have a loss of some sort,

1:59:43.700 --> 1:59:46.080
 could be death, could be a loss of another type,

1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:47.560
 breakup, et cetera,

1:59:47.560 --> 1:59:51.460
 that we can prepare ourselves to grieve more adaptively

1:59:51.460 --> 1:59:54.160
 by regulating the level of catecholamines,

1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:55.640
 in particular epinephrine.

1:59:55.640 --> 1:59:57.540
 That was well-described in the study

1:59:57.540 --> 1:59:58.960
 that I referred to earlier.

1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:01.020
 And tools such as the one found

2:00:01.020 --> 2:00:02.560
 in our Mastering Stress episode

2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:05.300
 and tools of the sort that we talked about today,

2:00:05.300 --> 2:00:07.300
 increasing that vagal tone

2:00:07.300 --> 2:00:11.000
 by actively building up the relationship between exhales

2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:13.060
 and slowing down of the heart rate,

2:00:13.060 --> 2:00:15.180
 so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:16.720
 those things can be very useful tools.

2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:20.480
 So we can actually encourage our nervous system

2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:21.760
 and build our nervous system

2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:23.800
 and build our mind to prepare for grief

2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:25.460
 when it inevitably will come.

2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:28.480
 Again, this is not about buffering ourselves

2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:29.680
 from the realities of life.

2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:33.400
 This is not about engaging from grief

2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:35.400
 as a real and important process.

2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:38.680
 And indeed it is a real and important process to engage in.

2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.920
 Those that enter denial

2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:43.820
 or trying to distract themselves with substances

2:00:43.820 --> 2:00:47.440
 or thinking or distracting of behavior,

2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:49.200
 substances or otherwise,

2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:51.000
 won't move through grief as well,

2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:54.080
 as adaptively as those who embrace a process

2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:55.480
 of the sort that I'm describing here.

2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:58.500
 And of course, I want to restate again,

2:00:58.500 --> 2:01:01.240
 that even though grief and depression

2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:04.280
 are now known to be fundamentally different,

2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:06.320
 even though people move through the different stages

2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:07.400
 of grief at different rates

2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:10.000
 and sometimes skip stages, et cetera,

2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:11.720
 it is often important to access

2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:13.920
 a trained professional psychologist or psychiatrist

2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:18.920
 or both or bereavement group or all of the above

2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:21.640
 in order to get the proper support for grieving.

2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:26.640
 So this is a podcast about science and science-based tools,

2:01:26.660 --> 2:01:29.600
 but I absolutely want to emphasize

2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:31.980
 that there are terrific resources out there

2:01:31.980 --> 2:01:33.520
 that you can access.

2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:35.200
 I don't say this in any kind of glib

2:01:35.200 --> 2:01:37.600
 or kind of pass the buck kind of way.

2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:41.960
 There are wonderful trained therapists, bereavement groups,

2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:45.720
 psychiatrists that are expert

2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:47.740
 in navigating these sorts of things.

2:01:47.740 --> 2:01:50.680
 I like to think that the tools that we've talked about today

2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:52.600
 would be not only compatible,

2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:54.000
 but would be complimentary

2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.280
 to the sorts of approaches that they take.

2:01:56.280 --> 2:01:59.520
 And as we think about this process of grief,

2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:02.620
 as we all should at some point in our lives,

2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:04.560
 because we all indeed will experience grief

2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:05.820
 in one form or another,

2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:10.160
 I would hope that the information that we discussed today

2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:13.120
 would not only give you some tools,

2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.000
 but hopefully give you a better understanding

2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.520
 of not just the people that you've lost

2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:18.580
 or that you stand to lose,

2:02:18.580 --> 2:02:21.800
 not just the animals that you've lost and stand to lose,

2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:24.040
 but also give you a sense of why it is

2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:26.360
 that the people who are still in your life

2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:27.200
 and that you're attached to,

2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:28.640
 the animals that are still in your life

2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:30.060
 and that you're attached to

2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:31.880
 have such profound meaning for you.

2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:35.160
 And I would encourage you to not lean away from,

2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:36.780
 but rather to lean into

2:02:36.780 --> 2:02:39.260
 the building of those episodic memories,

2:02:39.260 --> 2:02:42.760
 to build up a richer and richer set of experiences

2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:44.600
 and emotional attachments.

2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:47.080
 Because while the process of grieving

2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:50.240
 is in direct relation to how close we are attached to people,

2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:51.920
 there are ways to move through it.

2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:54.520
 And of course it is the depth of our attachments

2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:57.220
 and the number and the depth of meaning of experiences

2:02:57.220 --> 2:02:59.600
 that we share with others and with animals

2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:02.320
 that makes life so rich and worth living.

2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:04.200
 So I just want to take a moment and say thank you

2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:07.940
 for being willing to explore this rather complicated

2:03:07.940 --> 2:03:10.560
 and sometimes extremely challenging thing

2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:12.780
 that we call grief from the perspective

2:03:12.780 --> 2:03:15.740
 or through the lens of neuroscience and psychology.

2:03:15.740 --> 2:03:18.260
 I certainly learned a lot in exploring this literature.

2:03:18.260 --> 2:03:20.640
 I also really look forward to hosting

2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:24.020
 people like Dr. O'Connor on the podcast

2:03:24.020 --> 2:03:25.520
 and others on the podcast

2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:28.000
 who've done such beautiful work in this area.

2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.120
 I've put out the request and hopefully they'll join us soon

2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:33.220
 to further elaborate and teach us about

2:03:33.220 --> 2:03:36.280
 this fundamental component of our lives.

2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:38.960

 That's the best way to support us.

2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:08.760
 Not during today's episode,

2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:11.700
 but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:04:11.700 --> 2:04:13.160
 we've discussed supplements.

2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:14.980
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:17.360
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:21.140
 for things like easing and accelerating the transition time

2:04:21.140 --> 2:04:24.000
 into sleep and getting better, deeper sleep,

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.080
 as well as things such as focus, et cetera.

2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.240
 We've partnered with Momentous Supplements

2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:30.860
 because Momentous Supplements, first of all,

2:04:30.860 --> 2:04:32.960
 are of extremely high quality.

2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:34.440
 That's obviously important.

2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:36.060
 Also, they ship internationally.

2:04:36.060 --> 2:04:37.160
 We had heard from many of you

2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:38.780
 that you were having trouble accessing

2:04:38.780 --> 2:04:41.000
 some of the supplements that were described

2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.040
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:43.320
 because you did not live in the US.

2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:46.620
 Momentous ships both within the US and abroad.

2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:48.840
 And many of you have also requested

2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:51.600
 that there be a single site where you could access

2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:53.460
 all of the supplements that we've talked about

2:04:53.460 --> 2:04:55.580
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:04:55.580 --> 2:04:59.280
 Right now at livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:01.400
 you can find a subset of the supplements

2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:03.280
 that have been described on this podcast.

2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:05.720
 Again, all of the very highest quality,

2:05:05.720 --> 2:05:07.480
 each single ingredient supplements,

2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:08.560
 that turns out to be very important

2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:09.800
 if you're trying to develop

2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:11.520
 the proper array of supplements for you.

2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:13.360
 It's not helpful to have supplements

2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:14.580
 that include many ingredients.

2:05:14.580 --> 2:05:16.320
 So we encourage Momentous

2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:18.640
 to have single ingredient supplements

2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:20.520
 with dosages that allow you to build up

2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:23.840
 from the minimal effective dose and so on.

2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:25.080
 And the catalog of supplements

2:05:25.080 --> 2:05:26.880
 they are going to add to that location,

2:05:26.880 --> 2:05:28.900
 livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

2:05:28.900 --> 2:05:31.200
 is going to expand in the weeks and months to come.

2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:34.560
 And we expect that in fairly short amount of time,

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:36.080
 all of the supplements that we've described

2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:38.000
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast will be there.

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.800
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab

2:05:39.800 --> 2:05:41.560
 on Instagram and Twitter,

2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.920
 I post science and science-related tools

2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:45.560
 at Huberman Lab on Instagram,

2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:47.960
 also at Huberman Lab on Twitter.

2:05:47.960 --> 2:05:50.120
 Oftentimes that material will overlap somewhat

2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:52.160
 with the content covered on this podcast,

2:05:52.160 --> 2:05:53.960
 but more often than not,

2:05:53.960 --> 2:05:55.400
 what I'm covering on Instagram and Twitter

2:05:55.400 --> 2:05:57.440
 is distinct from the information I cover

2:05:57.440 --> 2:05:59.200
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:05:59.200 --> 2:06:02.680
 We also have a newsletter that has summaries of podcasts

2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:04.600
 and points to specific protocols

2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:06.760
 and links that could be useful to you.

2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:09.080
 That is the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:11.360
 And you can find it at HubermanLab.com.

2:06:11.360 --> 2:06:12.800
 Go to the menu, go to newsletter.

2:06:12.800 --> 2:06:14.740
 You can sign up simply by giving us your email.

2:06:14.740 --> 2:06:16.780
 We do not share your email with anybody else.

2:06:16.780 --> 2:06:19.640
 Our privacy policy is there and is made very clear.

2:06:19.640 --> 2:06:22.720
 You can also see some newsletters of months past.

2:06:22.720 --> 2:06:23.900
 So you can assess whether or not

2:06:23.900 --> 2:06:25.400
 you really do want to sign up.

2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:26.840
 Although I like to think that you will.

2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:30.320
 Again, zero cost, total privacy of your email account.

2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:33.400
 And many people find those summaries and takeaway tools

2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:34.820
 to be very useful in navigating

2:06:34.820 --> 2:06:38.520
 these admittedly long podcast episodes.

2:06:38.520 --> 2:06:40.800
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:06:40.800 --> 2:07:08.800
 thank you for your interest in science.
