00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.160 --> 00:13.060
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.060 --> 00:14.860
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.380
 Today, my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillette.

00:17.380 --> 00:20.580
 Dr. Gillette is dual board certified in family medicine

00:20.580 --> 00:23.820
 and obesity medicine and practices out of a clinic

00:23.820 --> 00:26.460
 in Kansas and via telemedicine.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.460
 He provides full spectrum medicine,

00:28.460 --> 00:31.220
 including hormone health, preventative medicine,

00:31.220 --> 00:33.700
 obstetrics, which is the branch of medicine and surgery

00:33.700 --> 00:35.020
 concerned with childbirth

00:35.020 --> 00:38.300
 and the care of women giving birth, and pediatrics.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.580
 I first learned about Dr. Gillette from a podcast

00:40.580 --> 00:42.220
 of all things, and was immediately struck

00:42.220 --> 00:43.860
 by the breadth and depth of his knowledge

00:43.860 --> 00:47.660
 on all things hormones and hormone optimization.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.520
 As you'll see very soon today,

00:49.520 --> 00:52.100
 Dr. Gillette can teach you how to optimize your hormones

00:52.100 --> 00:56.300
 using behavioral tools, nutrition, exercise-based tools,

00:56.300 --> 00:58.980
 supplementation, and hormone therapies

00:58.980 --> 01:00.820
 if those are appropriate for you.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.100
 There are many professionals out there,

01:02.100 --> 01:04.060
 including many medical doctors, of course,

01:04.060 --> 01:06.100
 talking about hormone health.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.980
 What really sets Dr. Gillette apart from the pack

01:08.980 --> 01:11.720
 is his ability to understand how the different factors

01:11.720 --> 01:14.100
 that I described before, nutrition, supplementation,

01:14.100 --> 01:15.740
 exercise, and hormone therapies,

01:15.740 --> 01:17.920
 how those interact with one another,

01:17.920 --> 01:20.300
 and the safest and most rational ways

01:20.300 --> 01:22.580
 to approach hormone optimization.

01:22.580 --> 01:23.540
 During today's episode,

01:23.540 --> 01:25.840
 you will learn how to optimize your hormones,

01:25.840 --> 01:27.640
 not just testosterone and estrogen,

01:27.640 --> 01:30.220
 but also prolactin and other hormone pathways

01:30.220 --> 01:33.300
 that impact your mood, mental health, and physical health.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.500
 Dr. Gillette is also an avid educator

01:35.500 --> 01:37.660
 about hormones and other aspects of health.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.700
 He does this on zero-cost-to-consumer platforms,

01:40.700 --> 01:42.800
 such as Instagram and other social media.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.860
 On Instagram, he is KyleJilletteMD.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.860
 That's K-Y-L-E-G-I-L-L-E-T-T, no E at the end, MD.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.860
 So KyleJilletteMD on Instagram,

01:52.860 --> 01:55.820
 and he is Gillette Health on all other platforms,

01:55.820 --> 01:58.600
 including LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.400
 If you go to his Instagram or his other social media,

02:01.400 --> 02:03.620
 you will learn a lot about hormone health,

02:03.620 --> 02:06.300
 about the latest science impacting obesity

02:06.300 --> 02:07.500
 and metabolic health.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.860
 He is a wealth of knowledge.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.100
 And again, he's providing all that information

02:11.100 --> 02:13.280
 at zero cost to you, the consumer.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.180
 What you are soon to hear is a conversation

02:15.180 --> 02:19.440
 between me and Dr. Gillette about all things hormones

02:19.440 --> 02:22.020
 and hormone health and hormone optimization.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.060
 We dive deep into mechanisms,

02:24.060 --> 02:27.360
 but we are clear to establish what each word

02:27.360 --> 02:29.420
 or set of concepts mean.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.440
 So if you have no background in biology, or even if you do,

02:32.440 --> 02:33.700
 I'm sure that you'll come away

02:33.700 --> 02:35.380
 with a wealth of valuable knowledge.

02:35.380 --> 02:38.660
 We also talk about specific protocols related, again,

02:38.660 --> 02:41.300
 to lifestyle factors, nutrition, supplementation,

02:41.300 --> 02:43.980
 and where appropriate, hormone replacement therapy.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.300
 I know there's a lot of interest about these topics.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.980
 Dr. Gillette is very thorough

02:47.980 --> 02:50.780
 about addressing both male and female issues

02:50.780 --> 02:52.700
 and addressing hormone health

02:52.700 --> 02:55.100
 for people at all stages of life.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.720
 I'm sure that you will come away from this episode

02:56.720 --> 02:58.500
 with the same impression that I did,

02:58.500 --> 02:59.700
 which is that Dr. Gillette

02:59.700 --> 03:02.140
 is an extraordinarily clear communicator

03:02.140 --> 03:04.900
 and that he has tremendous compassion for his patients

03:04.900 --> 03:08.140
 and that he has a deep love of understanding biology

03:08.140 --> 03:10.800
 and medicine in ways that can benefit you.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.180
 I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events

03:13.180 --> 03:15.020
 in May, 2022.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.860
 The first live event will take place in Seattle, Washington

03:17.860 --> 03:19.300
 on May 17th.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.060
 The second live event will take place in Portland, Oregon

03:22.060 --> 03:23.380
 on May 18th.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.760
 Both are part of a lecture series

03:24.760 --> 03:26.740
 entitled The Brain-Body Contract,

03:26.740 --> 03:28.180
 during which I will talk about science

03:28.180 --> 03:29.540
 and science-based tools,

03:29.540 --> 03:31.720
 many of which overlap with the topics covered

03:31.720 --> 03:33.300
 on the Huberman Lab podcast,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.260
 but most of which will not

03:35.260 --> 03:37.500
 and will be completely new topics and tools

03:37.500 --> 03:39.280
 never discussed publicly before.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.980
 Both live events will also include

03:40.980 --> 03:42.720
 a question and answer period

03:42.720 --> 03:44.120
 during which you, the audience,

03:44.120 --> 03:45.880
 can ask me questions directly

03:45.880 --> 03:48.700
 about any aspect of science or science-based tools,

03:48.700 --> 03:50.740
 and I will attempt to answer them.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.020
 Tickets for the two events,

03:52.020 --> 03:56.180
 again, Seattle on May 17th and Portland on May 18th,

03:56.180 --> 04:00.100
 are both available at HubermanLab.com slash tour.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.680
 Before we begin with today's episode,

04:01.680 --> 04:03.420
 I want to emphasize that this podcast

04:03.420 --> 04:06.340
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.600
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:08.600 --> 04:11.300
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:11.300 --> 04:13.940
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.020
 In keeping with that theme,

04:15.020 --> 04:17.780
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:17.780 --> 04:19.860
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.700
 Thesis makes nootropics.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.160
 In fact, they make custom nootropics.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.300
 Now, what is a nootropic?

04:25.300 --> 04:28.160
 Technically, nootropic means smart drug.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.820
 Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics

04:30.820 --> 04:32.580
 because what is smart?

04:32.580 --> 04:34.620
 I mean, there's creativity, there's focus,

04:34.620 --> 04:35.860
 there's task switching,

04:35.860 --> 04:37.760
 different aspects of our brain and body

04:37.760 --> 04:39.700
 engage different aspects of cognition,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.320
 many of which we can call smart.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.660
 There's emotional intelligence,

04:42.660 --> 04:44.060
 there's analytic intelligence,

04:44.060 --> 04:45.820
 there's logic, there's creativity.

04:45.820 --> 04:48.820
 Thesis understands this and has designed custom nootropics

04:48.820 --> 04:50.580
 designed to bring your body and brain

04:50.580 --> 04:53.120
 into the specific state that you want.

04:53.120 --> 04:53.960
 So for instance,

04:53.960 --> 04:56.940
 they have specific nootropics for creativity,

04:56.940 --> 04:59.040
 other nootropics for focus,

04:59.040 --> 05:02.500
 other nootropics for motivation and so on and so forth.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.700
 In addition to that,

05:03.700 --> 05:06.940
 each nootropic is custom designed for you.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.900
 They use only the highest quality ingredients,

05:08.900 --> 05:11.580
 things like alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine,

05:11.580 --> 05:14.020
 which I've talked about on this podcast before.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.060
 They also use ingredients like ginkgo biloba,

05:16.060 --> 05:19.060
 which many people use, like and benefit from.

05:19.060 --> 05:21.100
 However, there are also people like me

05:21.100 --> 05:22.540
 who can't take ginkgo biloba

05:22.540 --> 05:24.180
 because it gives me terrible headaches.

05:24.180 --> 05:25.440
 I learned that a long time ago

05:25.440 --> 05:27.520
 and so I simply can't take any nootropic

05:27.520 --> 05:28.940
 or any supplement for that matter

05:28.940 --> 05:31.060
 that includes ginkgo biloba.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.380
 I'm sure I'm not alone in the fact

05:32.380 --> 05:35.140
 that some ingredients work for me and others do not.

05:35.140 --> 05:38.360
 Thesis has solved this problem of individual variation

05:38.360 --> 05:40.280
 by creating a brief quiz.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.780
 So if you go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman

05:43.780 --> 05:45.500
 and take a three minute quiz,

05:45.500 --> 05:48.180
 and then Thesis will send you to four different formulas

05:48.180 --> 05:50.700
 that match your specific preferences.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.140
 Again, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman.

05:53.140 --> 05:54.580
 And if you use the code Huberman,

05:54.580 --> 05:57.900
 you'll get 10% off your first box of custom nootropics.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.780
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.300
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:03.300 --> 06:06.060
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:06.060 --> 06:07.660
 to help you better understand your body

06:07.660 --> 06:09.660
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.580
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

06:12.580 --> 06:14.820
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:14.820 --> 06:17.100
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:17.100 --> 06:20.040
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.820
 There are a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,

06:22.820 --> 06:25.020
 but a major issue with many of them

06:25.020 --> 06:27.780
 is that you get numbers back about levels of hormones,

06:27.780 --> 06:29.780
 metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,

06:29.780 --> 06:31.820
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.860
 Inside Tracker has solved that problem

06:33.860 --> 06:36.260
 by creating a personalized dashboard.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.800
 So you take your blood and or your DNA test,

06:38.800 --> 06:40.160
 you get the results back

06:40.160 --> 06:42.940
 and where certain values might be too high

06:42.940 --> 06:46.260
 or too low for your preference, you can click on that

06:46.260 --> 06:49.180
 and it will direct you immediately to lifestyle factors,

06:49.180 --> 06:50.900
 nutrition and supplementation, et cetera,

06:50.900 --> 06:52.940
 that can help you bring those numbers back

06:52.940 --> 06:55.300
 into the ranges that are ideal for you.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.940
 So it not only gives you information

06:56.940 --> 06:58.540
 about where your health stands,

06:58.540 --> 07:01.860
 it gives you directives as to how to improve your health.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.420
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:03.420 --> 07:06.180
 go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:06.180 --> 07:09.100
 to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.900
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.700
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.740
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

07:17.740 --> 07:20.220
 that are the absolute highest quality.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.840
 I spent a lifetime studying the visual system.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.300
 I can tell you that your visual system

07:24.300 --> 07:26.660
 is incredibly sophisticated.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.340
 It allows you to do things like move

07:28.340 --> 07:31.220
 from a shady area outside to a sunny area outside

07:31.220 --> 07:33.180
 and to adjust your visual system

07:33.180 --> 07:35.060
 so you don't even notice that transition.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.900
 A lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses are not designed

07:37.900 --> 07:40.620
 with those sorts of biological transitions in mind.

07:40.620 --> 07:43.200
 Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses are different.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.080
 Every one of their glasses is designed

07:45.080 --> 07:47.380
 with the biology of the visual system in mind.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.980
 First of all, they're incredibly lightweight

07:48.980 --> 07:50.940
 so you don't even notice that they're on your face.

07:50.940 --> 07:53.140
 Second of all, they were designed to be worn

07:53.140 --> 07:55.660
 during activities like running and cycling, et cetera,

07:55.660 --> 07:57.220
 and they won't slip off your face,

07:57.220 --> 07:59.460
 even if you get sweaty, and they have a terrific aesthetic.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.880
 So even though they were originally designed

08:00.880 --> 08:03.380
 as active eyewear, they look great.

08:03.380 --> 08:04.580
 So you can wear them out to dinner,

08:04.580 --> 08:06.300
 to school, at work, et cetera.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.620
 If you'd like to try Roka sunglasses or eyeglasses,

08:08.620 --> 08:11.300
 you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A dot com,

08:11.300 --> 08:14.740
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% on your first order.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.140
 Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A dot com,

08:17.140 --> 08:19.300
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.280
 And now for my discussion about hormone health

08:21.280 --> 08:24.340
 and optimization with Dr. Kyle Gillette.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.340
 Dr. Gillette, welcome.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.760
 Thank you for having me.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.860
 Well, I'm super excited to talk to you

08:29.860 --> 08:34.100
 because I found out about you on a podcast

08:34.100 --> 08:37.780
 and it immediately became clear

08:37.780 --> 08:40.300
 that you are an encyclopedia of knowledge

08:40.300 --> 08:43.460
 about hormone health for men and for women

08:43.460 --> 08:44.580
 across the lifespan.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.860
 So I have many, many questions,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.180
 but before we dive into those questions,

08:49.180 --> 08:51.780
 I'd love to just get a little bit of your background

08:51.780 --> 08:53.740
 in terms of your medical training

08:53.740 --> 08:56.340
 and what your particular orientation is

08:56.340 --> 08:57.860
 toward treating your patients.

08:57.860 --> 09:01.180
 And how do you think about this whole landscape

09:01.180 --> 09:02.300
 that we call hormone health?

09:02.300 --> 09:03.780
 What is a hormone?

09:03.780 --> 09:07.860
 How do you envision people managing their hormones?

09:07.860 --> 09:09.880
 If you could just kind of fill in a few of those blanks

09:09.880 --> 09:12.300
 for us, I think a lot of people would appreciate it.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.180
 Absolutely.

09:13.180 --> 09:16.000
 So I'm dual board certified in family medicine

09:16.000 --> 09:17.300
 and obesity medicine.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.220
 I've kind of tailored my training

09:20.220 --> 09:23.740
 in order to provide what I call a balanced approach

09:23.740 --> 09:28.240
 to total health, which includes body, mind, and soul.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.620
 I recently saw a podcast with Joe Rogan and Mr. Beast,

09:32.620 --> 09:35.160
 and Joe asks, Mr. Beast,

09:35.160 --> 09:38.180
 how do you become such an amazing YouTuber

09:38.180 --> 09:41.320
 and have all these great clickbait videos?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.940
 And how did you become good at it?

09:42.940 --> 09:44.820
 And it turns out he just became obsessed

09:44.820 --> 09:46.380
 when he was a teenager.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.100
 And that's essentially how I've tailored my education

09:49.100 --> 09:49.940
 as well.

09:49.940 --> 09:53.060
 I've become obsessed with optimal human performance,

09:53.060 --> 09:56.220
 their body, their mind, and even their spirit.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.620
 So I attended med school at the University of Kansas,

09:59.620 --> 10:02.220
 which is one of the few med schools

10:02.220 --> 10:04.860
 that still emphasizes full spectrum care.

10:04.860 --> 10:06.620
 They emphasize exercise as medicine.

10:06.620 --> 10:08.660
 They emphasize food as medicine,

10:08.660 --> 10:11.360
 of which I was active in both of those interest groups.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.820
 In residency, I was active in a lot

10:12.820 --> 10:14.740
 of mindfulness curriculum,

10:14.740 --> 10:17.180
 and then also things like walk with a doc,

10:17.180 --> 10:20.360
 where you emphasize preventative medicine.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.260
 That's something that we've kind of got away from,

10:22.260 --> 10:25.660
 and that niche led me to hormone health.

10:25.660 --> 10:27.660
 It didn't really start as hormone health,

10:27.660 --> 10:30.680
 but it's a very important component of health in general

10:30.680 --> 10:32.780
 that many people don't emphasize.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.500
 Great.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.260
 Well, this idea of preventative medicine,

10:36.260 --> 10:38.180
 I think is starting to really take hold

10:38.180 --> 10:39.980
 in the general population,

10:39.980 --> 10:42.220
 especially given the events of the last few years.

10:42.220 --> 10:45.620
 People realize that they are showing up to health challenges

10:45.620 --> 10:46.860
 at a bunch of different levels,

10:46.860 --> 10:48.920
 and with some people feeling very robust,

10:48.920 --> 10:51.020
 other people feeling back on their heels.

10:51.020 --> 10:53.560
 When someone comes to you as a patient,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.060
 what are some of the first things

10:55.060 --> 10:56.640
 that you want to know about them?

10:56.640 --> 10:58.900
 I mean, obviously you want to know their blood pressure,

10:58.900 --> 11:01.460
 you want to know something about their mental health

11:01.460 --> 11:02.620
 and family history,

11:02.620 --> 11:04.120
 but in terms of hormone health,

11:04.120 --> 11:06.540
 what are the sorts of probe questions that you ask,

11:06.540 --> 11:07.940
 and what are you looking for?

11:07.940 --> 11:09.940
 And I ask this because I'd like people to be able

11:09.940 --> 11:13.020
 to ask some of these very same questions for themselves.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.540
 Yeah.

11:14.540 --> 11:18.980
 So when you do a physical exam and a history,

11:18.980 --> 11:20.460
 you have a lot of different parts.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.060
 You have your history of present illness,

11:22.060 --> 11:23.100
 if they have a complaint.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.540
 Maybe the patient doesn't have a complaint.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.740
 In that case, things like their social history

11:27.740 --> 11:30.780
 and their family history are extremely important

11:30.780 --> 11:33.820
 because that gives you an insight into their genetics

11:33.820 --> 11:36.400
 and an insight into their hormone health.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.180
 So patients will tell me, oh, I'm doing okay,

11:39.180 --> 11:42.220
 but it helps to ask them, well, how are you now?

11:42.220 --> 11:43.420
 Let's say the patient is 50.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.980
 How are you now versus when you were 20?

11:45.980 --> 11:47.900
 And what has changed?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.420
 So I've gotten the question a lot,

11:49.420 --> 11:52.580
 how do you get your doctor to order a better lab workup

11:52.580 --> 11:55.700
 or to even include your basic hormones?

11:55.700 --> 11:58.540
 And there's no magic answer to that.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.180
 But what really helps is you tell them,

12:01.180 --> 12:03.100
 my energy is not as good as it used to be.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.020
 My focus is not as good as it used to be.

12:05.020 --> 12:08.160
 My athletic performance is not as good as it used to be.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.200
 So you don't have to have a pathology

12:10.200 --> 12:12.020
 in order for a lab to be indicated.

12:12.020 --> 12:14.540
 You just need to have that pertinent symptom.

12:14.540 --> 12:15.760
 I think that's gonna be really helpful

12:15.760 --> 12:18.700
 because for many people, the idea of getting a blood test

12:18.700 --> 12:20.740
 to look at their hormones just seems like

12:20.740 --> 12:22.620
 such an enormous hurdle to get over.

12:22.620 --> 12:26.020
 And many doctors won't prescribe them.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.540
 And would you say that it's using the approach

12:29.540 --> 12:33.300
 you just described that it's equally effective

12:33.300 --> 12:34.420
 for men and women?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.900
 Or do you find that for one reason or another,

12:36.900 --> 12:39.360
 that men and women have different challenges

12:39.360 --> 12:41.420
 and advantages in trying to access

12:41.420 --> 12:43.200
 their deeper hormone data?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.740
 Yeah, it's slightly different.

12:45.740 --> 12:48.620
 With women, there's a lot more objective data.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.320
 So if they're having menstrual irregularities

12:51.320 --> 12:55.580
 or if they're not having a period,

12:55.580 --> 12:57.520
 if they're having too heavy of periods,

12:57.520 --> 12:58.900
 then those are things that they talk about

12:58.900 --> 13:01.860
 very frequently with their doctor.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.460
 Men are more hesitant.

13:03.460 --> 13:06.860
 So men really wanna know what their testosterone is,

13:06.860 --> 13:08.380
 but at the same time,

13:08.380 --> 13:09.940
 they really don't wanna tell their doctor

13:09.940 --> 13:13.060
 how their libido is or how their energy is

13:13.060 --> 13:16.540
 because it's almost like they feel less masculine

13:16.540 --> 13:19.220
 or they feel less like a guy when they say that,

13:19.220 --> 13:21.740
 even if they're just talking to their doctor about it.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.840
 Yeah, I think that that raises a really important point,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.580
 which is that the whole discussion around hormone health

13:26.580 --> 13:28.940
 is a bit of a barbed wire topic

13:28.940 --> 13:32.200
 because in many ways, when we hear the word hormone,

13:32.200 --> 13:34.860
 we think testosterone and estrogen,

13:34.860 --> 13:37.900
 we think notions of masculinity and femininity.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.460
 And of course, testosterone and estrogen

13:39.460 --> 13:42.300
 are present in all sexes, right?

13:42.300 --> 13:44.100
 All chromosomal backgrounds

13:44.100 --> 13:46.540
 and just to varying degrees and ratios.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.980
 But it also raises all these issues about sexual health

13:48.980 --> 13:50.540
 that it's kind of interesting

13:50.540 --> 13:52.460
 because I'm surrounded by medical doctors

13:52.460 --> 13:53.980
 in my lab at Stanford.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.800
 And the more physicians that I surround myself with,

13:56.800 --> 14:00.300
 the more open is the discussion around sexual health

14:00.300 --> 14:01.580
 and reproductive health.

14:01.580 --> 14:02.820
 But in the general population,

14:02.820 --> 14:06.300
 I think some of these topics are a little bit taboo

14:06.300 --> 14:07.700
 or again, it's kind of barbed wire.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.940
 And so I think that people are seeking

14:08.940 --> 14:10.620
 a lot of this information on YouTube

14:10.620 --> 14:13.460
 and through communities that may or may not be very educated

14:13.460 --> 14:15.260
 about the actual biology.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.840
 So along those lines,

14:16.840 --> 14:19.600
 you know, we could probably assume

14:19.600 --> 14:22.520
 that hormones are changing across the lifespan, right?

14:22.520 --> 14:25.960
 Certainly from childhood and puberty and onward.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.720
 If you would, I'd love to just kind of take a snapshot

14:29.720 --> 14:33.660
 of what you think everybody should be thinking about

14:33.660 --> 14:37.240
 or doing to optimize their hormone health,

14:37.240 --> 14:41.600
 male or female, in the, let's say in their twenties.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.920
 And then maybe we could migrate that to their thirties

14:43.920 --> 14:44.760
 and forties.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.600
 But before that, could you just tell us

14:46.600 --> 14:49.480
 what everyone should be doing for their hormone health

14:49.480 --> 14:51.240
 from puberty onward?

14:51.240 --> 14:52.840
 Yeah.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.220
 The law of diminishing returns applies.

14:55.220 --> 14:58.760
 So doing a little amount of what I call

14:58.760 --> 15:01.840
 lifestyle interventions over a long period of time

15:01.840 --> 15:05.360
 is gonna be far more helpful or efficacious

15:05.360 --> 15:07.600
 than doing a lot and then doing nothing

15:07.600 --> 15:09.840
 or doing a lot and then doing nothing.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.760
 So I talk about the big six pillars.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.600
 The two strongest ones are likely diet and exercise.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.520
 For hormone health, specifically resistance training

15:19.520 --> 15:21.860
 is particularly helpful.

15:21.860 --> 15:26.860
 For diet, caloric restriction can be particularly helpful,

15:27.480 --> 15:30.240
 especially with the epidemic of metabolic syndrome

15:30.240 --> 15:33.240
 that is continuing to on-go in this country

15:33.240 --> 15:35.960
 and in developed countries in general.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.980
 So those are the two most powerful.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.720
 So number one and number two are diet and exercise.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.240
 For the last four, I have a little bit of alliteration.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.120
 So there's stress and stress optimization

15:47.120 --> 15:48.540
 that has to do with cortisol,

15:48.540 --> 15:50.300
 that has to do with your mental health,

15:50.300 --> 15:52.080
 that has to do with societal health

15:52.080 --> 15:54.900
 and collective health of your family as well.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.840
 When you're a member of a family

15:56.840 --> 15:58.340
 or even a very close friend,

15:59.840 --> 16:03.320
 trying to achieve optimal health together is very important.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.040
 It's the same thing with nicotine cessation.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.880
 It's the same thing with hormone optimization.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.720
 If you do it as a household unit, it's far more helpful.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.040
 So after stress, you have sleep optimization.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.160
 Sleep is extremely important,

16:16.160 --> 16:18.920
 especially for mitochondrial health as well.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.320
 And then you have sunlight,

16:20.320 --> 16:22.560
 which encompasses anything that's outdoors.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.380
 So you move more, you have cold exposure,

16:25.380 --> 16:27.720
 you have heat exposure, that's sunlight.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.640
 And then the last one is spirit.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.480
 So that's kind of the body, mind and soul.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.420
 If you have all the other five and they're dialed in

16:37.420 --> 16:39.960
 completely, but you don't have your spiritual health,

16:39.960 --> 16:41.160
 whatever you believe,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.820
 then that's going to profoundly impact your body

16:43.820 --> 16:44.880
 and your mind as well.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.660
 And we're definitely going to touch into this notion

16:46.660 --> 16:48.740
 of spiritual health, because I think for some people

16:48.740 --> 16:53.120
 that might draw connotations of certain things

16:53.120 --> 16:54.440
 that may or may not be accurate,

16:54.440 --> 16:57.040
 but I know a number of academic laboratories

16:57.040 --> 16:59.400
 that are focused on this and a number of,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.160
 not just functional medicine clinics,

17:01.160 --> 17:04.520
 but research clinics and hospitals throughout the country

17:04.520 --> 17:06.900
 that are achieving some really interesting data,

17:06.900 --> 17:09.420
 not just in people that are quite sick,

17:09.420 --> 17:11.120
 but in healthy people who are trying

17:11.120 --> 17:12.280
 to further optimize health.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.160
 So we will definitely touch back to that.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.600
 If you would be so kind as to maybe give us

17:17.600 --> 17:19.800
 a little bit more detail about some of these other areas.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.840
 So when people hear diet, I immediately think, okay,

17:22.840 --> 17:27.840
 now we get into the combat around vegan, plant-based,

17:28.020 --> 17:29.000
 carnivore, et cetera.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.760
 But I think that my general view of this is that

17:33.760 --> 17:35.160
 most people should probably be eating

17:35.160 --> 17:37.080
 as few highly processed foods,

17:37.080 --> 17:38.600
 highly palatable foods as possible,

17:38.600 --> 17:39.760
 which doesn't mean eating foods

17:39.760 --> 17:40.820
 that don't taste good, of course.

17:40.820 --> 17:44.120
 But what other sorts of things do you recommend

17:44.120 --> 17:45.240
 in the realm of diet?

17:46.480 --> 17:49.400
 And then I also want to know about caloric restriction,

17:49.400 --> 17:51.880
 because my understanding is that a caloric surplus

17:51.880 --> 17:55.200
 can actually support certain hormones like testosterone.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.400
 So how does one combine caloric restriction

17:57.400 --> 17:59.440
 and still optimize hormones?

17:59.440 --> 18:02.720
 But what would you say is a really terrific way

18:02.720 --> 18:04.800
 to think about and approach diet?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.040
 Yeah, diet should be an individualized approach.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.560
 So if you have a car, each car is made different

18:10.560 --> 18:12.360
 and requires a different sort of fuel,

18:12.360 --> 18:16.000
 whether it's a race car, whether it's a diesel truck,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.220
 they have different fuels

18:17.220 --> 18:19.880
 for different performance outcomes.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.160
 So if you're trying to tow something

18:21.160 --> 18:22.900
 or you're trying to go fast.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.580
 So it's the same way with athletes.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.620
 It's pretty well studied.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.080
 The more intra-workout carbs

18:29.080 --> 18:30.920
 ultra long distance athletes take,

18:30.920 --> 18:31.920
 in general, they do better.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.080
 I think they've studied this in cyclists quite often.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.040
 It also depends on your genetics.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.280
 So you can have a genetic polymorphism

18:39.280 --> 18:42.520
 and you metabolize carbs and sugar better,

18:42.520 --> 18:44.320
 even when they're unopposed by fiber.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.720
 How does one determine whether or not

18:46.720 --> 18:48.720
 they have such a polymorphism?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.160
 I mean, I'm an omnivore,

18:50.160 --> 18:53.600
 so I do eat some high quality meats, not in huge quantities,

18:53.600 --> 18:56.000
 but I also eat vegetables and starches, I feel fine.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.440
 I've never done an elimination diet.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.720
 I think I did a very low carb diet once

19:00.720 --> 19:03.440
 and all it gave me was a lot of psoriasis and poor sleep.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.000
 So I backed off, I probably didn't do it correctly,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.920
 but I know a lot of people that do quite well

19:07.920 --> 19:10.560
 on a very low carb or zero carb diet.

19:10.560 --> 19:15.200
 Yeah, particularly those who are at risk of cancer

19:15.200 --> 19:16.920
 because you have less glucose

19:16.920 --> 19:19.240
 that can be easily uptaken into cells.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.160
 And then also people with autoimmune diseases.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.400
 They tend to do well on-

19:23.400 --> 19:25.560
 On lower carb diets, yeah.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.420
 But yeah, as far as the, how do you know,

19:28.420 --> 19:30.680
 basically you can use your biofeedback,

19:30.680 --> 19:33.320
 how you're feeling to guess what you tolerate well,

19:33.320 --> 19:35.400
 or you can just get genetic testing,

19:35.400 --> 19:36.880
 which can be fairly expensive,

19:36.880 --> 19:40.000
 but most of all, it requires a physician

19:40.000 --> 19:43.040
 or someone who knows how to interpret the test accurately.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.640
 And if someone had the means or would you say

19:45.640 --> 19:48.520
 that getting regular blood testing is a good idea?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.600
 And if so, what is regular blood testing?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.520
 Is it every three months?

19:51.520 --> 19:52.800
 Is it every six months?

19:52.800 --> 19:55.320
 Of course, the backdrop of life is changing too,

19:55.320 --> 19:56.920
 stress levels, et cetera.

19:56.920 --> 20:01.240
 Yeah, every three to six months for preventative purposes.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.580
 At times you need blood tests at faster frequencies

20:04.580 --> 20:05.920
 than that.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.080
 And then you should also get a blood test

20:08.080 --> 20:10.560
 when you're fasting and when you're not fasting.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.620
 So if you're looking for damage to the beach,

20:12.620 --> 20:14.640
 you want to, you don't just look at low tide,

20:14.640 --> 20:16.400
 you look at high tide and you see what's happening

20:16.400 --> 20:17.720
 at high tide as well.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.960
 It's a great way to put it.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.380
 And in terms of general recommendations around exercise,

20:23.380 --> 20:26.320
 I mean, I'm of the mind based on the data that I've seen

20:26.320 --> 20:28.480
 that almost everybody should,

20:28.480 --> 20:32.800
 or everybody should be getting 150 to 180 minutes,

20:32.800 --> 20:35.200
 minimum of zone two cardio per week.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.160
 That kind of could continue while having a conversation,

20:39.160 --> 20:42.160
 but with, if one were to exert any more effort,

20:42.160 --> 20:43.600
 it would have a hard time getting the words out.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.920
 At least that, right?

20:44.920 --> 20:46.980
 For cardiovascular health and general brain health

20:46.980 --> 20:50.080
 and musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.780
 Is that more or less the contour of what you recommend?

20:52.780 --> 20:54.840
 Yeah, that's more or less the contour.

20:54.840 --> 20:59.540
 The more you're doing your zone two cardiovascular exercise,

21:00.380 --> 21:03.840
 the slightly less important a long duration

21:03.840 --> 21:05.740
 of caloric restriction is.

21:05.740 --> 21:06.580
 Interesting.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.240
 And that brings us to caloric restriction.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.320
 So it's very clear that caloric restriction

21:12.320 --> 21:14.920
 can allow one to lose weight, right?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.220
 This is the classic Kiko, C-I-C-O,

21:17.220 --> 21:18.440
 calories in, calories out.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.680
 We are not disputing calories in, calories out.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.040
 Somehow that always has to be stated 50 times in any forum

21:24.040 --> 21:25.920
 because of whatever follows.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.120
 People I think will anchor to and assume

21:28.120 --> 21:28.940
 that we don't mean that,

21:28.940 --> 21:31.180
 but I know you and I both agree on calories in,

21:31.180 --> 21:33.920
 calories out as a fundamental law of thermodynamics.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.660
 But it's clear to me that based on what I've read,

21:38.660 --> 21:42.060
 that when one is in a slight caloric surplus,

21:42.060 --> 21:44.840
 that hormones like testosterone can be optimized,

21:44.840 --> 21:47.120
 but is that true for somebody who's showing up

21:47.120 --> 21:48.840
 with excessive body fat?

21:48.840 --> 21:49.680
 How does this all work?

21:49.680 --> 21:52.340
 Because body fat is manufacturing enzymes

21:52.340 --> 21:54.040
 that convert testosterone to estrogen.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.480
 So in other words, how does someone know

21:55.480 --> 21:57.400
 if they should use caloric restriction

21:57.400 --> 21:58.960
 or avoid caloric restriction?

21:58.960 --> 22:01.000
 Yeah, here's how to parse that out.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.260
 So before I delve into the details a bit more,

22:04.260 --> 22:06.080
 I should say as a board certified

22:06.080 --> 22:07.820
 obesity medicine physician,

22:07.820 --> 22:10.840
 obviously the laws of thermodynamics apply.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.880
 And then in addition to that,

22:12.880 --> 22:16.340
 there is nothing special about intermittent fasting

22:16.340 --> 22:19.760
 or caloric restriction or exercise

22:19.760 --> 22:24.200
 when it pertains to losing body weight in general.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.240
 When you do lose weight,

22:25.240 --> 22:27.960
 about 33% of that is lean body mass

22:27.960 --> 22:31.080
 and about 10% of fat cells,

22:31.080 --> 22:34.100
 adipose cells are actually lean body mass as well,

22:34.100 --> 22:35.440
 because it has proteins and water

22:35.440 --> 22:37.240
 and things like that in it too.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.360
 So the reason for exercise

22:41.360 --> 22:44.420
 and the reason for caloric restriction in general,

22:44.420 --> 22:47.260
 including intermittent fasting is health reasons.

22:47.260 --> 22:49.240
 That's how you increase your health span.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.880
 It's not necessarily gonna make the weight

22:50.880 --> 22:53.820
 on the scale change, but that doesn't matter as much.

22:53.820 --> 22:56.200
 It's been fairly well studied in both mice and humans.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.980
 It's much easier to study in mice.

22:57.980 --> 23:01.520
 So that's a precursor to our six types of people,

23:01.520 --> 23:02.960
 the ones that care about mice studies

23:02.960 --> 23:05.060
 and the ones that care about human studies.

23:05.060 --> 23:08.620
 But if you calorically restrict mice by 40%,

23:08.620 --> 23:13.620
 then they can have improved testosterone parameters,

23:15.040 --> 23:17.120
 but only if they're obese to start.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.680
 And it appears to be that same way in humans as well.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.920
 So the easy way to think about it is if you're obese

23:22.920 --> 23:24.760
 or you have metabolic syndrome,

23:24.760 --> 23:27.900
 caloric restriction will improve your testosterone.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.480
 There has been a study and they talk about all these studies

23:30.480 --> 23:33.440
 in a systematic review from the Mayo Clinic proceedings

23:33.440 --> 23:35.600
 in March of last year.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.600
 And they note that there is a study in young healthy men

23:41.120 --> 23:42.720
 and they calorically restrict them

23:42.720 --> 23:44.600
 and their testosterone does decrease.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.040
 So if you're young and healthy

23:46.040 --> 23:47.680
 and you don't have metabolic syndrome,

23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
 then caloric restriction

23:48.680 --> 23:51.440
 will likely decrease your testosterone.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.400
 That clarifies a lot for me.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.480
 And I believe it will clarify a lot

23:55.480 --> 23:56.760
 for other people as well.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.000
 And I'm delighted that you pointed out this distinction

24:00.000 --> 24:02.720
 about intermittent fasting not being the only way

24:02.720 --> 24:04.400
 to achieve caloric restriction.

24:04.400 --> 24:09.400
 There are a number of young healthy or older healthy people

24:10.320 --> 24:12.980
 I know who like using intermittent fasting,

24:12.980 --> 24:15.400
 even if they're not trying to lose weight.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.520
 For a couple of reasons,

24:16.520 --> 24:18.920
 some believe that it might extend lifespan.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.000
 I think there's still,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.400
 that's still a bit of an open question.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.820
 It's a bit of a hard experiment to do

24:22.820 --> 24:24.480
 because the control group is,

24:24.480 --> 24:26.560
 no one wants to be in the control group, as I say.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.860
 It does in mice.

24:27.860 --> 24:28.700
 Right, exactly.

24:28.700 --> 24:29.520
 Captain audience.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.360
 Exactly.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.120
 And the other feature of it that's a little bit tricky

24:33.120 --> 24:35.800
 is that many people like intermittent fasting

24:35.800 --> 24:37.280
 because of the mental effects,

24:37.280 --> 24:39.440
 the clarity of mind that they feel during fasting,

24:39.440 --> 24:43.380
 the increased pleasure in eating when they finally do eat.

24:43.380 --> 24:47.540
 And here I'm referring to intermittent fasting of the sort

24:47.540 --> 24:48.820
 where eating windows are anywhere

24:48.820 --> 24:50.300
 from eight to 12 hours a day,

24:50.300 --> 24:52.800
 not extended fast of 24 hours or more.

24:52.800 --> 24:57.520
 So the question therefore is for the healthy,

24:57.520 --> 24:59.340
 lean enough person, right?

24:59.340 --> 25:01.620
 Non-obese person.

25:01.620 --> 25:03.700
 Is intermittent fasting a bad idea

25:03.700 --> 25:05.400
 in terms of hormone health?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.320
 Is oscillating between this period of kind of feast

25:08.320 --> 25:10.940
 and famine within a 24 hours a problem

25:10.940 --> 25:14.220
 if one is getting sufficient calories to maintain weight?

25:14.220 --> 25:16.540
 Yeah, so if they're in a caloric maintenance,

25:16.540 --> 25:18.380
 then it's not going to be,

25:20.340 --> 25:21.620
 it's not going to be deleterious.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.060
 It's not going to be bad for their hormone health.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.260
 There's a couple of different hormones

25:25.260 --> 25:26.100
 that we can talk about.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.620
 We can talk about testosterone.

25:27.620 --> 25:31.420
 We can talk about DHEA, which usually go hand in hand.

25:31.420 --> 25:33.380
 And then we can also talk about growth hormone,

25:33.380 --> 25:36.860
 which is not a steroid hormone, but it's a peptide hormone.

25:36.860 --> 25:39.820
 So it's a chain of proteins,

25:39.820 --> 25:43.060
 amino acids that are put together in sort of a sterile,

25:43.060 --> 25:46.540
 think of sterile hormones as coming from cholesterol.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.740
 So intermittent fasting,

25:48.740 --> 25:52.300
 you do get a little spike in growth hormone after you eat,

25:52.300 --> 25:56.180
 but you also get a huge spike in growth hormone,

25:56.180 --> 26:00.840
 a more significant, less negligible spike overnight.

26:00.840 --> 26:05.120
 And that is improved if you are intermittent fasting.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.140
 So it's probably going to help your growth hormone

26:08.140 --> 26:11.060
 and subsequently IGF-1 levels,

26:11.060 --> 26:14.260
 which will help more in older age groups

26:14.260 --> 26:15.700
 than younger age groups.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.500
 And I like to eat dinner.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.800
 So for me, that means sometime around six or seven o'clock,

26:19.800 --> 26:20.700
 sometimes eight o'clock.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.700
 I confessed last night because I was working late.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.460
 I ate pretty big.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.140
 I was basically my only meal of the day at 10 o'clock.

26:27.140 --> 26:28.600
 That's a rare thing for me.

26:29.980 --> 26:33.620
 Can I still achieve a high degree of growth hormone output

26:33.620 --> 26:36.740
 if I, let's say I avoid food in the two to three hours

26:36.740 --> 26:38.100
 before going to sleep?

26:38.100 --> 26:40.620
 Or does one have to be very deep into a fast

26:40.620 --> 26:44.260
 in order to achieve the increase in growth hormone?

26:44.260 --> 26:46.720
 There's still pretty good growth hormone output,

26:46.720 --> 26:49.860
 even if you eat two or three hours before you sleep.

26:49.860 --> 26:51.620
 It's just the law of diminishing returns.

26:51.620 --> 26:55.340
 The longer you go, you get slightly more and slightly more.

26:55.340 --> 26:56.660
 Great.

26:56.660 --> 26:59.520
 And I know a number of people think of growth hormone

26:59.520 --> 27:03.160
 in the context of the exogenous growth hormone

27:03.160 --> 27:05.500
 and the fact that that can, in some cases,

27:05.500 --> 27:08.700
 be associated with cancers.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.200
 I've been asked many times before,

27:10.200 --> 27:13.020
 can the increase in growth hormone from things like saunas

27:13.020 --> 27:15.560
 or intermittent fasting cause levels of growth hormone

27:15.560 --> 27:18.540
 that are so high that they cause cancers?

27:18.540 --> 27:20.940
 My impulse is to say, no, that doesn't,

27:20.940 --> 27:23.700
 that seems like it's not likely to happen,

27:23.700 --> 27:27.060
 but I should probably verify that statement with you.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.740
 Yeah, so quite unlikely.

27:28.740 --> 27:32.020
 I think about growth hormone and especially IGF-1,

27:32.020 --> 27:34.060
 and there's actually an IGF-1 and IGF-2,

27:34.060 --> 27:37.780
 but I think about it in terms of endocrine IGF-1,

27:37.780 --> 27:41.120
 mostly IGF-1 that's synthesized in the liver

27:41.120 --> 27:45.700
 and released in the liver versus IGF-1 that's released.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.860
 Classically, an example of this would be

27:47.860 --> 27:51.320
 your IGF-1 levels increase after resistance training

27:51.320 --> 27:55.020
 or exercise, and that's more of like paracrine or autocrine,

27:55.020 --> 27:57.560
 and they have more local action.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.700
 So that IGF-1, it's pretty well studied

28:00.700 --> 28:02.580
 that if you just give people IGF-1,

28:02.580 --> 28:05.500
 it's not going to, at physiologic levels,

28:05.500 --> 28:08.380
 it's not going to improve their body composition.

28:08.380 --> 28:11.720
 However, that IGF-1 that's autocrine and paracrine

28:11.720 --> 28:14.900
 just working in those local tissues and muscles

28:14.900 --> 28:17.220
 is likely part of the reason why you get

28:17.220 --> 28:21.660
 a improved body composition response after exercise.

28:21.660 --> 28:22.500
 I see.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.640
 And just to clarify for me and for others,

28:26.620 --> 28:30.460
 what can we say are the major functions of IGF-1 and IGF-2

28:30.460 --> 28:32.500
 that are distinct from just growth hormone?

28:32.500 --> 28:34.840
 Are they just kind of the active form of growth hormone,

28:34.840 --> 28:39.840
 the kind of the pickaxe end of the assembly line?

28:40.620 --> 28:42.820
 So they have a much longer duration of action.

28:42.820 --> 28:46.020
 I believe the half-life of IGF-1 is several days,

28:46.020 --> 28:48.020
 almost a week, whereas growth hormone

28:48.020 --> 28:51.660
 has an extremely fast half-life of only hours.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.620
 So growth hormone acts significantly

28:54.620 --> 28:58.380
 on the liver to produce IGF-1.

28:58.380 --> 29:03.380
 So it's around in the serum, in the blood long enough

29:04.400 --> 29:08.780
 to where it's producing an effect pretty much all the time.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.060
 Very interesting.

29:10.060 --> 29:12.540
 Well, and then your other pillars, stress,

29:12.540 --> 29:13.860
 you know, we've talked a lot about stress

29:13.860 --> 29:17.020
 on this podcast before and tools for managing stress.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.000
 Sleep obviously is a big one.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.540
 I think, you know, if nothing else,

29:22.540 --> 29:25.340
 I will either put people to sleep with my podcasts.

29:25.340 --> 29:27.780
 I'm certainly not this one, but my solo episodes

29:27.780 --> 29:30.300
 or hopefully convince people that sleep

29:30.300 --> 29:32.200
 is the foundation of mental and physical health

29:32.200 --> 29:33.060
 and performance.

29:33.060 --> 29:36.000
 Are there any aspects of hormone optimization

29:36.000 --> 29:37.460
 that can improve sleep?

29:37.460 --> 29:40.100
 I know sleep can improve hormone optimization,

29:40.100 --> 29:42.720
 but are there any aspects of hormone optimization

29:42.720 --> 29:44.180
 that can improve sleep?

29:44.180 --> 29:47.140
 And for people that are suffering from this common syndrome

29:47.140 --> 29:48.580
 of going to sleep and then waking up

29:48.580 --> 29:49.920
 at three or four in the morning,

29:49.920 --> 29:51.580
 we know that can be associated with depression,

29:51.580 --> 29:54.180
 but are there any hormonal indications

29:54.180 --> 29:57.620
 that might lead to that kind of situation?

29:57.620 --> 29:59.860
 Yeah, there's three big ones.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.620
 The first one is not super common,

30:02.620 --> 30:04.780
 but it's a very direct correlation.

30:04.780 --> 30:08.700
 If you have a growth hormone deficiency, a true deficiency,

30:08.700 --> 30:10.300
 whether you're an adult or a child,

30:10.300 --> 30:12.900
 then your sleep is likely going to be affected.

30:12.900 --> 30:16.260
 And let's say you're a child with growth hormone deficiency.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.980
 Once that is replaced with therapy,

30:18.980 --> 30:21.700
 your sleep is gonna get significantly better.

30:21.700 --> 30:25.060
 The second one that's a very common scenario

30:25.060 --> 30:28.380
 is if you're having what's called vasomotor symptoms

30:28.380 --> 30:31.300
 of menopause or vasomotor symptoms of andropause,

30:31.300 --> 30:33.740
 which are also applicable.

30:33.740 --> 30:37.360
 And that's where your progestogenic activity,

30:37.360 --> 30:41.300
 so your main progestogens are progesterone

30:41.300 --> 30:42.580
 and then pregnenolone,

30:42.580 --> 30:45.740
 and then 5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone,

30:45.740 --> 30:46.580
 which is a slight-

30:46.580 --> 30:48.220
 Where are those manufactured in the body?

30:48.220 --> 30:51.440
 So they're manufactured in a few places.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.660
 In men, they're manufactured some in the testes

30:54.660 --> 30:56.060
 and the late egg cells.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.100
 In women, they're manufactured in the ovaries

30:58.100 --> 30:59.580
 until menopause,

30:59.580 --> 31:02.700
 and then they're also manufactured in the adrenal glands.

31:02.700 --> 31:07.620
 So if you're preadrenopausal,

31:07.620 --> 31:10.580
 where your adrenal glands are still working fairly well,

31:10.580 --> 31:13.460
 usually still have a decent amount of progesterone around,

31:13.460 --> 31:15.460
 and this can be measured too.

31:15.460 --> 31:18.620
 So after menopause,

31:18.620 --> 31:22.460
 women make progesterone from their ovaries,

31:22.460 --> 31:24.580
 or sorry, from their adrenal glands.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.860
 If that progesterone crosses the blood-brain barrier,

31:27.860 --> 31:30.260
 especially if it's 5-alpha and 3-alpha reduced,

31:30.260 --> 31:32.140
 so it's modified a little bit,

31:32.140 --> 31:34.980
 then it is both a GABA agonist,

31:34.980 --> 31:37.180
 which helps sleep just like GABA does,

31:37.180 --> 31:38.780
 gamma-aminobutyric acid,

31:38.780 --> 31:41.540
 the main inhibitory neurotransmitter

31:41.540 --> 31:42.900
 of which lots of things work on.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.720
 Alcohol works on GABA as well.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.940
 GABA-Penten also works on GABA.

31:46.940 --> 31:50.060
 Migraine medicines, many of them work on GABA.

31:50.060 --> 31:53.740
 Benzodiazepines and also non-benzos.

31:53.740 --> 31:55.800
 So an example of a benzo would be Xanax.

31:55.800 --> 32:00.580
 An example of a non-benzo would be Ambien.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.300
 So those all work on GABA.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.700
 So GABA is also helped

32:04.700 --> 32:07.760
 by the progestogenic activity as well.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.420
 That's why a lot of women in menopause

32:09.420 --> 32:11.800
 feel like their sleep is much worse,

32:11.800 --> 32:15.580
 is because they have lower activity of those progestogens.

32:15.580 --> 32:18.440
 And for men in so-called andropause,

32:19.420 --> 32:20.540
 low testosterone,

32:20.540 --> 32:24.180
 is that also one of the causes of poor sleep?

32:24.180 --> 32:26.460
 Low testosterone can lead to poor sleep,

32:26.460 --> 32:29.980
 but my third scenario is actually,

32:29.980 --> 32:32.140
 if a man begins TRT,

32:32.140 --> 32:35.120
 then they develop a poor sleep because of sleep apnea.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.860
 It drastically raises the risk

32:37.860 --> 32:39.940
 that somebody is going to have sleep apnea.

32:39.940 --> 32:40.820
 And then a lot of people,

32:40.820 --> 32:42.100
 especially when they first started

32:42.100 --> 32:43.500
 in the first month or two,

32:43.500 --> 32:45.860
 it puts them into this hyper sympathetic state

32:45.860 --> 32:49.500
 because they have overactive androgen receptors,

32:49.500 --> 32:52.940
 especially after a long time of being hypogonadal.

32:52.940 --> 32:56.920
 Then they have a physiologic dose of TRT,

32:56.920 --> 33:00.100
 and that causes the sleep issue itself.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.580
 Interesting.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.420
 I have a lot of questions

33:02.420 --> 33:05.320
 about TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.160
 I should just mention

33:06.160 --> 33:09.740
 that when you say it increases sympathetic activity,

33:10.700 --> 33:14.220
 you don't mean that taking testosterone

33:14.220 --> 33:15.760
 increases sympathy for others.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.980
 It may in fact do the opposite,

33:16.980 --> 33:18.900
 although it's very clear from my discussions

33:18.900 --> 33:22.300
 with my colleagues in the endocrinology side

33:22.300 --> 33:24.860
 and also with the great Dr. Robert Sapolsky

33:24.860 --> 33:26.680
 that increasing testosterone

33:26.680 --> 33:30.120
 merely exacerbates existing features of people.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.620
 So the jerks become bigger jerks,

33:31.620 --> 33:35.180
 kind people become even more kind in general.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.720
 But I want to get into TRT in depth,

33:37.720 --> 33:39.320
 but it's very interesting to me to hear

33:39.320 --> 33:41.700
 that testosterone replacement therapy

33:41.700 --> 33:44.200
 increases the risk of sleep apnea.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.420
 And I want to make sure that I ask that,

33:47.420 --> 33:50.540
 is that also the case in people that are using TRT

33:50.540 --> 33:52.140
 who are not hypogonadal?

33:52.140 --> 33:54.300
 Because in the classic situation,

33:54.300 --> 33:55.980
 if somebody isn't making enough testosterone,

33:55.980 --> 33:58.340
 they're below 300 nanograms per deciliter on the chart,

33:58.340 --> 33:59.180
 they go in and take TRT.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.940
 But many people nowadays, let's be honest,

34:01.940 --> 34:04.980
 are taking doses of testosterone

34:04.980 --> 34:07.140
 even though they are in the sort of standard range

34:07.140 --> 34:08.620
 because the range is so large

34:08.620 --> 34:11.220
 because of other symptomology, is that right?

34:11.220 --> 34:14.980
 Yeah, I do love the analogy that Dr. Sapolsky had

34:14.980 --> 34:17.960
 about monks taking testosterone and making them

34:17.960 --> 34:19.500
 more and more generous.

34:19.500 --> 34:23.340
 So that does appear to be what testosterone usually does

34:23.340 --> 34:26.860
 is it exacerbates, if you will, what you're previously like.

34:26.860 --> 34:29.520
 So it's not going to change you as a person.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.860
 But if you're ugonadal before you start testosterone-

34:33.860 --> 34:34.940
 Meaning?

34:34.940 --> 34:37.020
 Meaning you have normal testosterone

34:37.020 --> 34:41.560
 and then you start TRT or self-administered TRT,

34:41.560 --> 34:44.100
 steroids, however you want to look at it,

34:44.100 --> 34:46.540
 then your risk of sleep apnea still goes up

34:46.540 --> 34:48.140
 in a dose dependent fashion.

34:48.140 --> 34:50.740
 So the higher the dose, the more risky.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.460
 With the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system,

34:53.460 --> 34:56.140
 the sympathetic is the fight or flight nervous system.

34:56.140 --> 34:58.900
 The parasympathetic is the rest and digest.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.700
 So if you have too much fight or flight

35:00.700 --> 35:02.220
 and stress can cause that too,

35:02.220 --> 35:04.260
 then you're not going to rest as well at night.

35:04.260 --> 35:07.500
 I want to touch on testosterone in women

35:07.500 --> 35:11.060
 because there is testosterone in women.

35:11.060 --> 35:13.460
 I'd like to know where that testosterone comes from,

35:13.460 --> 35:14.900
 which tissues.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.640
 I'd like to know whether or not

35:16.640 --> 35:19.480
 testosterone replacement therapy makes sense in women.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.260
 I'm hearing more and more about women using testosterone.

35:22.260 --> 35:25.060
 And I'd like to know whether or not

35:25.060 --> 35:26.540
 knowing a woman's testosterone,

35:26.540 --> 35:30.820
 for her to know her testosterone is of equal,

35:30.820 --> 35:33.400
 less than, or more value than knowing,

35:33.400 --> 35:35.240
 for instance, progesterone and estrogen levels.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.820
 Because I think there are a lot of misconceptions

35:36.820 --> 35:38.740
 about the roles of testosterone in women.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.180
 For health optimization,

35:40.180 --> 35:43.220
 testosterone is just as important to know.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.700
 For pathology prevention,

35:45.700 --> 35:48.820
 for example, breast cancer, osteoporosis,

35:48.820 --> 35:52.340
 estrogen and progesterone are more important to know.

35:52.340 --> 35:53.780
 So when you're thinking about women,

35:53.780 --> 35:56.220
 women think that they have such a tiny amount of testosterone

35:56.220 --> 35:57.820
 because you test it.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.900
 Most people test a free testosterone.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.240
 So testosterone that's unbound,

36:02.240 --> 36:06.840
 which is by far the smallest proportion of testosterone.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.300
 Any androgen is bound by lots of different

36:10.300 --> 36:12.480
 steroid binding proteins,

36:12.480 --> 36:15.520
 but the ones that are most pertinent are called SHBG,

36:15.520 --> 36:17.740
 or sex hormone binding globulin.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.700
 And that binds the androgenic steroid,

36:20.700 --> 36:23.540
 for example, DHT or dihydrotestosterone.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.620
 It's associated with prostate enlargement,

36:25.620 --> 36:27.580
 associated with male pattern baldness.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.740
 It binds that the most strongly,

36:29.740 --> 36:32.620
 and then it binds testosterone next most strongly.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.500
 And then it binds things like androstenedione

36:35.500 --> 36:39.700
 or DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.580
 And then it binds the estrogens, the weakest,

36:42.580 --> 36:44.320
 like estradiol.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.300
 So if you look at the total amount of testosterone,

36:47.300 --> 36:50.900
 women actually have, almost all women, not all women,

36:50.900 --> 36:55.900
 but almost all of them have significantly more testosterone

36:56.060 --> 36:57.580
 than estradiol,

36:57.580 --> 37:00.740
 but it's because it's in different measurements.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.900
 So estradiol a lot of time is, you know,

37:02.900 --> 37:06.260
 grams per mil as opposed to nanograms per deciliter.

37:06.260 --> 37:09.720
 So women have more testosterone than estrogen

37:09.720 --> 37:14.060
 and significantly more DHEA than either.

37:14.060 --> 37:14.900
 Interesting.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.820
 Do women make dihydrotestosterone?

37:16.820 --> 37:18.060
 Yeah.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.460
 And where does this testosterone come from?

37:20.460 --> 37:22.120
 Because they don't have testes.

37:22.120 --> 37:22.960
 Yeah.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.620
 So most testosterone in women that are premenopausal

37:25.620 --> 37:29.360
 can come from theca cells, T-H-E-C-A.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.440
 So theca cells are cells in the ovaries

37:31.440 --> 37:33.340
 that can produce testosterone.

37:33.340 --> 37:35.580
 And a lot of people have actually heard

37:35.580 --> 37:38.700
 about hyperthecosis, not the term itself,

37:38.700 --> 37:41.660
 but a lot of Olympians that are,

37:41.660 --> 37:44.960
 their chromosomes are XY, they're females,

37:44.960 --> 37:47.220
 and they're not taking any-

37:47.220 --> 37:48.820
 Wait, they're XY, but they're females?

37:48.820 --> 37:51.340
 Sorry, they're XX, yeah, thank you.

37:51.340 --> 37:54.300
 So they're XX, they're not XY,

37:54.300 --> 37:55.860
 and they have never transitioned

37:55.860 --> 37:59.580
 or been on any sort of hormone replacement or testosterone,

37:59.580 --> 38:03.260
 but they naturally produce a huge amount of testosterone,

38:03.260 --> 38:05.100
 as much as many men.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.480
 And some of these women,

38:06.480 --> 38:08.140
 I believe they were from Botswana,

38:08.140 --> 38:10.640
 were banned from competing in the Olympics

38:10.640 --> 38:12.440
 in certain distances.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.900
 I believe they were banned from the 400 meter and 800 meter

38:15.900 --> 38:17.780
 because their natural testosterone

38:17.780 --> 38:19.300
 was deemed to be too high.

38:19.300 --> 38:22.140
 So they mistakenly thought that they were using steroids?

38:22.140 --> 38:24.840
 They actually knew they were not using steroids.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.380
 They knew it was their theca cells

38:26.380 --> 38:28.900
 were just genetically gifted, I suppose,

38:28.900 --> 38:31.520
 and they still made them change distances.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.860
 So one or two of these athletes changed to,

38:33.860 --> 38:37.240
 I believe it was a 3K or the 5K,

38:37.240 --> 38:38.860
 and they still did quite well,

38:38.860 --> 38:40.580
 but it was not their best event.

38:40.580 --> 38:41.420
 Interesting.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.140
 Yeah, that's turning out to be a very interesting

38:43.140 --> 38:46.140
 and controversial area of this notion of hormone therapies

38:46.140 --> 38:48.220
 and natural variation in hormones

38:48.220 --> 38:49.900
 on different chromosomal backgrounds.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.860
 Fascinating, we should probably do a whole episode

38:51.860 --> 38:54.360
 about that, because it's very much of the times.

38:55.780 --> 38:59.240
 So men and women both make DHT.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.260
 I'd like to ask about DHT in men.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.620
 So often we hear about testosterone in men

39:04.620 --> 39:08.740
 and free testosterone and being the unbound form, of course,

39:08.740 --> 39:13.580
 but dihydrotestosterone, where does it come from in men?

39:13.580 --> 39:17.380
 What is the cascade of events that takes testosterone

39:17.380 --> 39:18.900
 to dihydrotestosterone?

39:18.900 --> 39:21.780
 And what are some of the quote unquote positive

39:21.780 --> 39:23.860
 and negative effects of,

39:23.860 --> 39:28.180
 here I'm only referring to endogenous dihydrotestosterone.

39:28.180 --> 39:31.300
 And in fact, I'll make it very clear whether or not

39:31.300 --> 39:33.220
 I'm talking about taking something

39:33.220 --> 39:34.620
 or one's own natural production.

39:34.620 --> 39:35.940
 Here we're just, I think up until now,

39:35.940 --> 39:37.940
 we've just been talking about natural production.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.420
 So tell us about DHT in men.

39:40.420 --> 39:43.700
 It's such a powerful hormone during development, obviously,

39:43.700 --> 39:45.100
 but what is it doing?

39:45.940 --> 39:48.700
 DHT is a very androgenic hormone.

39:48.700 --> 39:51.380
 So whether you're talking about DHEA,

39:51.380 --> 39:54.940
 which is a mild, a weak androgen,

39:54.940 --> 39:58.420
 or testosterone, which is a relatively strong androgen,

39:58.420 --> 40:01.340
 or DHT, which is a very strong androgen,

40:01.340 --> 40:03.300
 they bind to the androgen receptor

40:03.300 --> 40:05.340
 in both men and in women.

40:05.340 --> 40:08.540
 So the effect of all three of those

40:08.540 --> 40:11.180
 is mediated by the androgen receptor.

40:11.180 --> 40:13.940
 There's a couple of different beta estradiol receptors

40:13.940 --> 40:15.820
 and alpha estradiol receptors,

40:15.820 --> 40:18.340
 but there's only one androgen receptor.

40:18.340 --> 40:21.020
 Intriguingly, it is on the X chromosome.

40:21.020 --> 40:25.220
 So men get their androgen receptor gene from their mother.

40:25.220 --> 40:29.700
 Women get one androgen receptor gene from their father,

40:29.700 --> 40:30.980
 one from their mother.

40:30.980 --> 40:33.620
 Often the one that is more sensitive to androgens

40:33.620 --> 40:36.500
 and people with PCOS, that's the one that's active.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.900
 The other one is methylated and inactive.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.060
 Can I just pause you one second?

40:40.060 --> 40:42.540
 Sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask this question

40:42.540 --> 40:43.740
 before I forget.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.220
 And I know a number of people are probably wondering,

40:45.220 --> 40:47.300
 I've heard that whether or not

40:47.300 --> 40:50.380
 one develops male pattern baldness,

40:50.380 --> 40:53.660
 whether or not a male develops male pattern baldness,

40:53.660 --> 40:55.180
 just to be very precise,

40:56.580 --> 40:58.500
 you could get some information about that

40:58.500 --> 41:00.740
 by looking at your mother's father.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.140
 And that would be in keeping with what you just described

41:03.140 --> 41:04.020
 that the X chromosome,

41:04.020 --> 41:06.580
 which of course is handed off through the mother

41:06.580 --> 41:09.260
 is carrying the genes that encode

41:09.260 --> 41:11.020
 for the number and distribution

41:11.020 --> 41:14.060
 of these androgen receptors that DHT will bind to.

41:14.060 --> 41:15.900
 Because of course, I think as you'll probably tell us

41:15.900 --> 41:18.220
 that DHT is responsible for male pattern baldness

41:18.220 --> 41:19.580
 and beard growth, is that right?

41:19.580 --> 41:21.940
 Should I look at my grandfather on my mother's side

41:21.940 --> 41:23.740
 to determine what I'm likely to look like

41:23.740 --> 41:26.780
 in terms of my DHT-ness, is that a word?

41:26.780 --> 41:29.380
 Yeah, it's the best guess that you can make

41:29.380 --> 41:31.020
 purely from phenotypes.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.020
 And you can measure your genotype

41:33.020 --> 41:35.940
 and get a better idea of that.

41:35.940 --> 41:38.140
 Assuming that it's true male pattern baldness,

41:38.140 --> 41:40.420
 it's related to the gene transcription

41:40.420 --> 41:42.220
 of the androgen receptor.

41:42.220 --> 41:44.260
 So I like to think of it as

41:44.260 --> 41:48.100
 how much of this androgen receptor gene

41:48.100 --> 41:50.780
 is activated by any androgen.

41:50.780 --> 41:53.020
 So if you have an extremely sensitive gene,

41:53.020 --> 41:55.940
 which usually means you have very few CAG repeats,

41:55.940 --> 41:59.420
 which is basically just a certain CAG encodes

41:59.420 --> 42:02.180
 for a certain amino acid.

42:02.180 --> 42:04.740
 And if you have very few of the repeats,

42:04.740 --> 42:07.460
 then your androgen receptor gene works better.

42:07.460 --> 42:10.300
 Think of it as a corollary to Huntington's disease,

42:10.300 --> 42:14.260
 where if you have very few called trinucleotide repeats,

42:14.260 --> 42:17.200
 then it's not as severe of a disease.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.140
 But after you get more and more CAG repeats,

42:20.140 --> 42:22.540
 which by the way are in the population,

42:22.540 --> 42:24.800
 you're getting more and more CAG repeats.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.960
 So it's a natural selection of process

42:27.960 --> 42:32.700
 that has been ongoing for a variety of number of reasons.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.340
 But anyway, if you have more repeats,

42:34.340 --> 42:37.060
 then that gene activates in the cytoplasm

42:37.060 --> 42:38.340
 and moves to the nucleus

42:38.340 --> 42:40.900
 and causes gene transcription more often

42:40.900 --> 42:42.620
 and hair loss more often.

42:42.620 --> 42:45.380
 So does that mean that we're seeing more hair loss now

42:45.380 --> 42:50.300
 due to elevated levels of DHT than we were 50 years ago?

42:50.300 --> 42:51.520
 Probably not.

42:52.380 --> 42:56.660
 The hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years ago,

42:56.660 --> 43:00.140
 but 500 years ago was probably more significant

43:00.140 --> 43:02.760
 because on average 500 years ago,

43:02.760 --> 43:05.500
 people were more sensitive to androgens.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.340
 So there's a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome,

43:09.340 --> 43:13.420
 AIS, and that syndrome was related to when men

43:13.420 --> 43:16.620
 who have the copy from their mother who is a carrier,

43:16.620 --> 43:19.840
 their AR gene or androgen receptor gene

43:19.840 --> 43:21.800
 is completely insensitive.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.280
 So think of it, it's not related to the CAG repeats,

43:25.280 --> 43:30.280
 but think of that receptor as just not working at all.

43:30.620 --> 43:31.940
 So there's a continuum.

43:31.940 --> 43:34.460
 So everybody's receptor works a little bit better

43:34.460 --> 43:38.100
 or a little bit worse, and the better your receptor works,

43:38.100 --> 43:40.920
 the more likely you are to have male pattern baldness.

43:40.920 --> 43:45.920
 To zoom out from this, but still keeping an eye on DHT,

43:46.980 --> 43:51.980
 what do you like to see all women and all men do

43:52.100 --> 43:54.340
 to optimize DHT?

43:54.340 --> 43:56.300
 And here I'm talking about regardless of age.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.200
 So we're still in this from puberty onward phase.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.880
 We haven't yet micro dissected out decade by decade,

44:01.880 --> 44:04.500
 which we will do, but what do you like to see people do

44:04.500 --> 44:05.940
 to keep DHT in check?

44:05.940 --> 44:07.600
 But before you tell us that,

44:07.600 --> 44:11.920
 could you tell us what positive things DHT does

44:11.920 --> 44:13.700
 when it's in the proper range?

44:13.700 --> 44:16.620
 Yeah, so DHT helps a lot for,

44:16.620 --> 44:18.300
 it's the same reason why testosterone helps.

44:18.300 --> 44:20.560
 It activates the androgen receptor gene.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.500
 It helps effort feel good.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.620
 So it can be motivating.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.220
 So that's how it's active in the CNS.

44:27.220 --> 44:30.420
 It also is active in cardiovascular tissue.

44:30.420 --> 44:34.620
 So if you look at someone that has heart failure,

44:34.620 --> 44:37.400
 or if someone has cardiac hypertrophy,

44:37.400 --> 44:40.980
 the level of DHT can matter because it's also binding

44:40.980 --> 44:43.020
 to the androgen receptor in the myocardium

44:43.020 --> 44:45.200
 or in the heart itself.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.620
 So you think of the classic bodybuilder heart,

44:48.620 --> 44:50.500
 that's an easy example to make.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.340
 They have very thickened muscle.

44:52.340 --> 44:55.600
 Their muscle is very strong because they're pumping blood

44:55.600 --> 44:59.460
 often with high blood pressure and that DHT

44:59.460 --> 45:03.540
 and the testosterone and any DHT derivatives like masterone

45:03.540 --> 45:08.100
 or oxandrolone, primaboulin also bind to the heart

45:08.100 --> 45:10.580
 and they cause even more hypertrophy

45:10.580 --> 45:13.140
 or enlargement of that muscle tissue.

45:13.140 --> 45:15.980
 So then let's say the person stops and they're recovering

45:15.980 --> 45:18.780
 and they're trying to have cardiac remodeling,

45:18.780 --> 45:21.600
 which is where you take a very thick heart

45:21.600 --> 45:23.180
 and cardiac remodeling is important

45:23.180 --> 45:27.000
 in a lot of different cardiac pathologies.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.580
 But if you give them finasteride or dutasteride,

45:29.580 --> 45:33.580
 which inhibit the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT,

45:33.580 --> 45:37.260
 so making less activity at the androgen receptor gene,

45:37.260 --> 45:40.260
 they have cardiac remodeling and their heart health improves.

45:40.260 --> 45:41.100
 I see.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.660
 So for the non-bodybuilder, the typical woman or man

45:43.660 --> 45:48.660
 or younger or older, what sorts of things support DHT

45:49.140 --> 45:51.300
 and thereby heart health?

45:51.300 --> 45:53.520
 Presumably DHT is involved in some of the other things

45:53.520 --> 45:56.260
 that testosterone is famous for in both men and women,

45:56.260 --> 45:58.340
 things like libido, as you mentioned,

45:58.340 --> 46:02.500
 making effort feel good, so motivation drive and vitality,

46:02.500 --> 46:05.760
 is I guess could be the general phrase.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.980
 What sorts of things support DHT?

46:07.980 --> 46:11.540
 What sorts of things create problems for DHT?

46:11.540 --> 46:14.380
 There's lots of dietary changes and supplementation

46:14.380 --> 46:16.020
 that you're probably doing right now

46:16.020 --> 46:17.540
 that's affecting your DHT.

46:17.540 --> 46:18.380
 You mean me personally?

46:18.380 --> 46:21.220
 Well, everybody, all of the listeners,

46:22.220 --> 46:26.620
 because let's say you have a diet high in plant polyphenols.

46:26.620 --> 46:28.940
 Many of those inhibit the enzyme

46:28.940 --> 46:31.020
 that converts testosterone to DHT.

46:32.660 --> 46:36.380
 Could you give us an example of one of those,

46:36.380 --> 46:39.380
 either in supplementation form or in food form?

46:39.380 --> 46:43.460
 Curcumin, certain curcuminoids, depending on the structure,

46:43.460 --> 46:46.500
 will inhibit the enzyme called 5-alpha reductase

46:46.500 --> 46:48.380
 that converts testosterone to DHT.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.220
 Turmeric.

46:49.220 --> 46:51.460
 Yeah, turmeric, black pepper extract.

46:51.460 --> 46:55.380
 So it's used often to increase bioavailability.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.500
 It's also called biopurine.

46:57.500 --> 46:59.780
 It's also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.

47:01.900 --> 47:04.820
 And on top of that, people have different genetics too.

47:04.820 --> 47:07.700
 So some people, there are 5-alpha reductase enzymes.

47:07.700 --> 47:08.800
 There's three of them.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.940
 They're on chromosome two, three, and four, I believe.

47:12.940 --> 47:15.380
 But some of them are active in the prostate.

47:15.380 --> 47:17.420
 Some of them are active in the brain.

47:17.420 --> 47:19.660
 And so it depends on which tissue.

47:19.660 --> 47:22.500
 They're tissue-specific enzymes

47:22.500 --> 47:26.200
 that depend on how much DHT you convert.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.060
 Do you recommend that people avoid curcumin

47:28.060 --> 47:29.980
 and turmeric for that reason?

47:29.980 --> 47:32.100
 And is there any specific recommendations

47:32.100 --> 47:33.340
 for men versus women?

47:34.440 --> 47:36.820
 If a man or a woman, by the way, in women,

47:36.820 --> 47:39.960
 a lot of times if you just ask your doctor for a DHT check,

47:39.960 --> 47:41.420
 it's the same unit as in men.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.460
 So it's essentially undetectable.

47:43.460 --> 47:46.380
 So you have to, you know,

47:46.380 --> 47:48.180
 especially if they're on oral contraceptives,

47:48.180 --> 47:49.140
 which is a different topic,

47:49.140 --> 47:51.740
 their DHT is very likely undetectable,

47:51.740 --> 47:53.740
 especially if it's free DHT.

47:53.740 --> 47:57.200
 You can measure both a DHT and a free DHT.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.500
 But if someone's DHT is already low

47:59.500 --> 48:04.260
 or if they have somewhat insensitive androgen receptor

48:04.260 --> 48:07.420
 via genetics or via lifestyle,

48:07.420 --> 48:11.180
 then I recommend they avoid bioavailable curcuminoids

48:11.180 --> 48:14.500
 like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract,

48:14.500 --> 48:16.660
 and they might be a good candidate for creatine.

48:16.660 --> 48:19.620
 Creatine, like creatine monohydrate,

48:19.620 --> 48:21.700
 can significantly increase the conversion

48:21.700 --> 48:23.200
 of testosterone to DHT.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.040
 Interesting.

48:24.040 --> 48:25.340
 There's also a lot of really interesting data

48:25.340 --> 48:30.060
 coming out now about the role of creatine as a brain fuel

48:30.060 --> 48:32.220
 and maybe even as a cognitive enhancer over time.

48:32.220 --> 48:34.220
 The data are still ongoing,

48:34.220 --> 48:36.560
 but some of the studies in humans are pretty impressive,

48:36.560 --> 48:38.180
 at least to me.

48:38.180 --> 48:39.100
 I'm glad you mentioned this thing

48:39.100 --> 48:40.420
 about curcumin and black pepper.

48:40.420 --> 48:42.700
 I wish we'd had this conversation six years ago

48:42.700 --> 48:43.980
 because I had the experience

48:43.980 --> 48:48.100
 of jumping on the bandwagon of the excitement around turmeric

48:48.100 --> 48:49.660
 when I took a turmeric supplement.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.800
 It was a couple of capsules of what I thought to be,

48:52.800 --> 48:54.940
 and I think was high quality turmeric.

48:54.940 --> 48:58.000
 And I've never felt as poor as I did

48:58.000 --> 48:59.620
 in the subsequent few days.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.340
 Flat line of, let's just say,

49:01.340 --> 49:04.060
 everything that one would want to have in life,

49:04.060 --> 49:07.540
 energy, vitality, just, it was a cliff.

49:07.540 --> 49:11.140
 And a friend somehow knew

49:11.140 --> 49:13.940
 that curcumin could inhibit 5-alpha reductase

49:13.940 --> 49:17.020
 that converts testosterone to DHT, as you pointed out.

49:17.020 --> 49:19.540
 I stopped taking it, it was the only new addition

49:19.540 --> 49:21.200
 to my diet and supplementation,

49:21.200 --> 49:23.600
 and things bounced back within about three, four days,

49:23.600 --> 49:25.860
 but it was remarkable.

49:25.860 --> 49:27.380
 I mean, I felt like garbage,

49:27.380 --> 49:29.060
 and it was actually kind of frightening

49:29.060 --> 49:32.540
 to experience the sharpness of that cliff.

49:32.540 --> 49:35.500
 But I know that some people like turmeric

49:35.500 --> 49:39.440
 for its anti-inflammatory properties, et cetera.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.500
 Sounds like people either need to experiment or,

49:43.500 --> 49:45.940
 and if they do, obviously to approach that with caution

49:45.940 --> 49:47.460
 anytime you add or remove something,

49:47.460 --> 49:50.140
 you need to talk to your doctor, you're a doctor,

49:50.140 --> 49:53.320
 and I'm guessing that if one were to experiment,

49:54.580 --> 49:56.380
 would you say that most of these effects

49:56.380 --> 49:59.240
 of things like curcumin are reversible as they were in me,

49:59.240 --> 50:01.820
 or is there any potential of permanent damage

50:01.820 --> 50:04.080
 if people have been taking them for a long time?

50:04.080 --> 50:06.860
 The effects are nearly always reversible.

50:06.860 --> 50:09.700
 When you're talking about 5-alpha reductase inhibition,

50:09.700 --> 50:11.660
 so what turmeric does, but stronger,

50:12.780 --> 50:14.260
 the most common story that we hear

50:14.260 --> 50:17.500
 is regarding a supplement known as saw palmetto,

50:17.500 --> 50:20.420
 which a lot of older men take for their prostate health,

50:20.420 --> 50:23.120
 or finasteride, which you can take for your prostate,

50:23.120 --> 50:26.240
 or your heart, or your hair, or dutasteride.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.780
 So if you're having side effects on these,

50:28.780 --> 50:31.560
 then it's probably because of a couple different reasons.

50:31.560 --> 50:36.300
 One can be your ratio of androgens to estrogens is off,

50:36.300 --> 50:37.740
 and that needs addressed.

50:37.740 --> 50:40.780
 Another one can be, it's inhibiting the conversion

50:40.780 --> 50:44.220
 of your progesterone to that other type of progesterone,

50:44.220 --> 50:46.300
 a 5-alpha, 3-alpha that we talked about earlier

50:46.300 --> 50:47.780
 that's helping with your sleep,

50:47.780 --> 50:50.100
 and your brain, and your calmness,

50:50.100 --> 50:54.020
 and that's definitely an effect.

50:54.020 --> 50:57.940
 Another one is depending on the type of supplement or med,

50:57.940 --> 51:00.380
 they inhibit different isoenzymes

51:00.380 --> 51:01.880
 of that 5-alpha reductase.

51:01.880 --> 51:05.700
 So if they're just inhibiting one and two,

51:05.700 --> 51:07.300
 then that's gonna be a different effect

51:07.300 --> 51:09.260
 than if they're inhibiting two and three.

51:09.260 --> 51:11.420
 So finasteride does two and three,

51:11.420 --> 51:13.060
 saw palmetto does one and two,

51:13.060 --> 51:15.940
 and then dutasteride does all three.

51:15.940 --> 51:18.020
 The third one is active in the brain,

51:18.020 --> 51:19.860
 and dutasteride inhibits that third one

51:19.860 --> 51:23.860
 a little bit weaker in vivo, but strongly in vitro.

51:23.860 --> 51:26.240
 So it's really hard to parse out.

51:26.240 --> 51:28.840
 You can use biofeedback and experimentation.

51:28.840 --> 51:32.400
 I do think with supplements, it's safe to experiment.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.300
 The time that it takes to set in

51:34.300 --> 51:36.300
 is usually about three months.

51:36.300 --> 51:39.380
 So the risk of, and this is anecdotally,

51:39.380 --> 51:41.180
 there's been lots of research published

51:41.180 --> 51:46.180
 about if post-finasteride syndrome is real or fake,

51:46.580 --> 51:49.740
 and it is real, but it's one of those things

51:49.740 --> 51:53.120
 that's a combination of organic and inorganic disease,

51:53.120 --> 51:54.960
 almost kind of like fibromyalgia,

51:54.960 --> 51:56.380
 where it's definitely real,

51:56.380 --> 51:58.840
 and there's lots of things that you can do to help with it,

51:58.840 --> 52:01.340
 but it's very unlikely to occur

52:01.340 --> 52:04.360
 if you stop taking your supplement or medication

52:04.360 --> 52:05.620
 after you have side effects.

52:05.620 --> 52:06.460
 Interesting.

52:06.460 --> 52:08.800
 Well, I certainly feel better when I'm taking five grams

52:08.800 --> 52:10.480
 of creatine monohydrate per day.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.580
 I know most people take it for muscle growth

52:12.580 --> 52:15.020
 and tissue repair and things of that sort.

52:15.020 --> 52:17.460
 Mainly, I think, brings water into the muscle tissue,

52:17.460 --> 52:20.020
 et cetera, but I take it for the brain effects,

52:20.020 --> 52:22.080
 and also because I like to think that it gives me

52:22.080 --> 52:26.300
 a little bit of a DHT bump that I can actually see

52:26.300 --> 52:28.240
 in my blood charts when I've done them.

52:29.180 --> 52:33.240
 I know many people want to avoid the hair loss

52:33.240 --> 52:34.500
 that can sometimes be associated

52:34.500 --> 52:36.540
 with DHT levels going too high.

52:36.540 --> 52:38.160
 And so I've been asked many times,

52:38.160 --> 52:40.780
 does creatine monohydrate cause hair loss?

52:40.780 --> 52:44.980
 It would make sense that if creatine increases DHT and DHT,

52:44.980 --> 52:46.860
 binding to the endocrine receptor on the scalp

52:46.860 --> 52:49.280
 can induce hair loss, that that would be the case.

52:49.280 --> 52:53.260
 Is that true, or are people just overly concerned

52:53.260 --> 52:55.900
 about something that's trivial or non-existent?

52:57.060 --> 53:01.180
 Each male, so yes, it can potentially add it.

53:01.180 --> 53:02.920
 I don't like to say it causes it,

53:02.920 --> 53:06.200
 but it can be a little bit more fuel to the fire.

53:06.200 --> 53:08.820
 So just like everybody has a different sensitivity

53:08.820 --> 53:10.180
 of their androgen receptor,

53:10.180 --> 53:13.300
 they have a different amount of gene transcription

53:13.300 --> 53:16.260
 that is going to cause death of the follicle.

53:16.260 --> 53:17.780
 That's an arbitrary threshold.

53:17.780 --> 53:20.460
 So you don't really know until you start losing hair.

53:20.460 --> 53:23.220
 And if somebody takes a little bit of creatine

53:23.220 --> 53:24.300
 to increase their DHT,

53:24.300 --> 53:25.840
 maybe for the cognitive enhancing effects

53:25.840 --> 53:26.860
 or for whatever reason,

53:26.860 --> 53:29.140
 and they notice a little bit more hair falling out

53:29.140 --> 53:32.020
 in the sink and they stop taking it,

53:32.020 --> 53:33.620
 you just said death of the follicle,

53:33.620 --> 53:35.200
 which sounds very dramatic.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.540
 Are those little stem cell niches

53:37.540 --> 53:40.320
 that reside in the follicle, which hairs grow from,

53:40.320 --> 53:41.380
 are those then abolished?

53:41.380 --> 53:42.900
 Like there's no going back,

53:42.900 --> 53:45.380
 or can you want to rescue the hair?

53:45.380 --> 53:46.580
 It takes months.

53:46.580 --> 53:48.940
 If they're still there, the hair will come back.

53:48.940 --> 53:52.260
 So the loss of the hair itself

53:52.260 --> 53:54.460
 is a normal part of the hair cycle.

53:54.460 --> 53:57.380
 So you have your androgen phase, your catagen phase,

53:57.380 --> 54:00.060
 your telogen phase, and then your hair loss,

54:00.060 --> 54:00.900
 and then a new follicle.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.380
 Of the stem cell niche in the hair follicle.

54:03.380 --> 54:05.220
 Think of it like sharks have teeth.

54:05.220 --> 54:06.660
 So a shark loses a tooth

54:06.660 --> 54:08.340
 and they have a new one that comes through,

54:08.340 --> 54:10.160
 or losing your baby tooth and you have a new one,

54:10.160 --> 54:12.000
 but your hair just always keeps coming through.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.180
 So it's natural for it to die and lose.

54:15.180 --> 54:18.740
 That's why when you start five alpha reductase inhibitors,

54:18.740 --> 54:20.420
 often you have a big shed.

54:20.420 --> 54:22.500
 So what happens during that big shed

54:22.500 --> 54:26.180
 is all of these cells that are unhealthy,

54:26.180 --> 54:27.680
 they immediately jettison that hair

54:27.680 --> 54:30.820
 and they start making a much healthier new follicle.

54:30.820 --> 54:34.340
 So all of the hairs that are at the end of their

54:34.340 --> 54:38.580
 telogen phase, then they have what's called

54:38.580 --> 54:41.780
 telogen effluvium, which also happens after pregnancy,

54:41.780 --> 54:44.740
 also happens in thyroid pathologies.

54:44.740 --> 54:46.740
 So you shed it, a new one comes in place,

54:46.740 --> 54:49.220
 and you think that you're having a horrible hair loss

54:49.220 --> 54:52.980
 caused by your finasteride or whatever you're doing,

54:52.980 --> 54:54.740
 and minoxidil does this too,

54:54.740 --> 54:57.580
 but you're really just having a new, healthier follicle.

54:57.580 --> 55:00.280
 If you go a really long time, if you go a year,

55:00.280 --> 55:03.100
 then those hairs might come back and they might not.

55:03.100 --> 55:07.020
 So for simplicity sake, if somebody is concerned about

55:07.020 --> 55:09.440
 or is experiencing hair loss, male or female,

55:09.440 --> 55:14.440
 what are their options of ways to offset that hair loss

55:15.320 --> 55:18.360
 that are not going to negatively impact

55:18.360 --> 55:20.140
 other tissues sensitive to DHT?

55:20.140 --> 55:22.500
 And what I'm basically saying here is

55:22.500 --> 55:26.460
 I could imagine taking a DHT inhibitor,

55:26.460 --> 55:29.420
 a pill of some sort or an injection of some sort,

55:29.420 --> 55:31.980
 and offsetting hair loss,

55:31.980 --> 55:34.100
 maybe even stimulating more hair growth.

55:34.100 --> 55:35.540
 It's clear that I'm not doing that,

55:35.540 --> 55:36.820
 but I know people that do,

55:36.820 --> 55:39.300
 but then experience some of the other negative effects

55:39.300 --> 55:41.860
 of blunting DHT, reduced affect, reduced libido,

55:41.860 --> 55:45.820
 reduced drive, disruptions in prostate function,

55:45.820 --> 55:48.660
 or even sexual function generally.

55:48.660 --> 55:51.340
 So what can people do if they want to maintain

55:51.340 --> 55:52.160
 or grow back hair,

55:52.160 --> 55:54.300
 but they don't want all those other effects?

55:54.300 --> 55:56.020
 What should they avoid?

55:56.020 --> 55:58.060
 And what should they perhaps consider

55:58.060 --> 56:00.020
 talking to their doctor about?

56:00.020 --> 56:01.780
 There's a whole host of options.

56:02.820 --> 56:06.080
 I try to separate alopecia or hair loss

56:06.080 --> 56:07.500
 into two different categories,

56:07.500 --> 56:10.500
 male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia,

56:10.500 --> 56:13.460
 also known as androgenetic alopecia,

56:13.460 --> 56:17.700
 versus other types of alopecia, usually telogen effluviums.

56:17.700 --> 56:22.240
 And if it's androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness,

56:22.240 --> 56:24.700
 even if they're female, perhaps say a PCOS,

56:24.700 --> 56:26.020
 something like that,

56:26.020 --> 56:28.580
 then you want some sort of strategy

56:28.580 --> 56:31.700
 to decrease the activity of that androgen receptor.

56:31.700 --> 56:33.820
 So women can get male pattern baldness?

56:33.820 --> 56:34.660
 Absolutely.

56:34.660 --> 56:36.520
 Okay, I'm gonna have to wrap my head around that one,

56:36.520 --> 56:37.740
 but okay.

56:37.740 --> 56:40.140
 So there's a lot of different things

56:40.140 --> 56:41.780
 that you can do that are topical.

56:41.780 --> 56:45.100
 The most promising is called dutasteride mesotherapy.

56:45.100 --> 56:48.940
 Essentially what it is is it's very localized injections

56:48.940 --> 56:52.020
 in areas that are prone to male pattern baldness,

56:52.020 --> 56:54.340
 whether they're female or male.

56:54.340 --> 56:57.340
 And it acts locally only,

56:57.340 --> 56:59.960
 and you repeat these injections from time to time.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.020
 It decreases the conversion of testosterone to DHT

57:03.020 --> 57:04.920
 just in the scalp.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.880
 So that can avoid prostate effects.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.500
 And what are some of the negative effects

57:08.500 --> 57:12.720
 of blocking DHT in females in the periphery,

57:12.720 --> 57:15.100
 meaning not on the scalp or in the brain,

57:15.100 --> 57:18.740
 but where is DHT doing its stuff?

57:18.740 --> 57:20.260
 Yeah, so it's both DHT

57:20.260 --> 57:23.540
 and then also that 5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone,

57:23.540 --> 57:27.540
 which is called THP or dihydroprogesterone

57:27.540 --> 57:30.780
 or tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone.

57:30.780 --> 57:33.560
 So they're active in the central nervous system,

57:33.560 --> 57:36.240
 but it's also just active, again,

57:36.240 --> 57:39.280
 binding to the androgen receptor in a female as well,

57:39.280 --> 57:42.560
 causing them to have that effort, feel good motivation.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.660
 A lot of women that are sensitive to DHT,

57:45.660 --> 57:48.360
 because women can be sensitive to DHT as well,

57:48.360 --> 57:52.480
 feel very different when they start an oral contraceptive,

57:52.480 --> 57:55.860
 not because it alters their DHT to a huge amount.

57:55.860 --> 57:57.660
 It does to some degree,

57:57.660 --> 58:00.540
 because the negative feedback inhibition in the pituitary

58:00.540 --> 58:02.340
 and less produced in the ovaries,

58:02.340 --> 58:05.720
 but it increases SHBG really high.

58:06.620 --> 58:09.660
 So because their SHBGs are significantly higher,

58:09.660 --> 58:12.560
 their free DHT is way lower.

58:12.560 --> 58:13.700
 I see.

58:13.700 --> 58:16.260
 How does a woman know if she has PCOS,

58:16.260 --> 58:18.160
 polycystic ovarian syndrome?

58:18.160 --> 58:20.860
 What are the issues with polycystic ovarian syndrome?

58:20.860 --> 58:22.620
 What can be done about PCOS?

58:22.620 --> 58:25.140
 I confess I was naive to PCOS.

58:26.420 --> 58:28.860
 That wasn't supposed to rhyme, but since it does,

58:28.860 --> 58:31.500
 I do confess I was completely naive to it.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.900
 And I started getting a lot of questions about it

58:33.900 --> 58:35.340
 in various forums.

58:35.340 --> 58:37.820
 And I think that's actually the reason

58:37.820 --> 58:39.340
 why I initially approached you.

58:39.340 --> 58:42.300
 I know you have treated a lot of PCOS.

58:43.300 --> 58:46.600
 What age women should be thinking about PCOS?

58:46.600 --> 58:48.140
 What's PCOS?

58:48.140 --> 58:50.060
 Teach us about PCOS, please.

58:50.060 --> 58:54.140
 So PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome.

58:54.140 --> 58:56.260
 And this is one of those conditions

58:56.260 --> 58:58.640
 which is underdiagnosed.

58:58.640 --> 59:02.580
 So its prevalence is much higher than we think it is.

59:02.580 --> 59:03.580
 There's been a lot of studies,

59:03.580 --> 59:08.460
 and some studies say prevalence of 10%, some say 20%.

59:08.460 --> 59:10.840
 It's not completely clinically penetrant.

59:10.840 --> 59:13.100
 So most people don't know they have PCOS

59:13.100 --> 59:16.220
 until they have infertility or subfertility.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.460
 And is PCOS happening at this frequency

59:18.460 --> 59:20.860
 in 20-year-old women and 30-year-old women

59:20.860 --> 59:22.100
 and 40 and onward?

59:22.100 --> 59:25.500
 Most women find out they have PCOS in their 30s,

59:25.500 --> 59:28.260
 especially because it's on a spectrum or a continuum

59:28.260 --> 59:30.700
 like a lot of things where you can have a weaker version

59:30.700 --> 59:32.060
 or a very severe version.

59:32.060 --> 59:33.900
 What are the symptoms?

59:33.900 --> 59:37.540
 There's a criteria called the Rotterdam criteria.

59:37.540 --> 59:39.060
 And in the Rotterdam criteria,

59:39.060 --> 59:41.400
 there's a couple of different ways that you can diagnose it.

59:41.400 --> 59:45.940
 You're looking for androgen excess, insulin resistance,

59:45.940 --> 59:47.900
 and you can also look for polycystic ovaries.

59:47.900 --> 59:50.220
 You don't actually have to have polycystic ovaries

59:50.220 --> 59:53.260
 or to get an ultrasound of your ovaries to be diagnosed.

59:53.260 --> 59:55.780
 If you have androgen excess, for example,

59:55.780 --> 59:58.500
 androgenic acne or hormonal acne,

59:58.500 --> 1:00:00.660
 if you have hair growth, like a hair growth on the chin,

1:00:00.660 --> 1:00:02.820
 it's called a hirsutism,

1:00:02.820 --> 1:00:06.540
 or if you have deepening of the voice,

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.540
 any symptom of too much male pattern baldness,

1:00:11.540 --> 1:00:14.520
 if you're a female, that's a symptom of PCOS as well.

1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:17.220
 Then you can also have insulin resistance.

1:00:17.220 --> 1:00:20.660
 So this is obesity, it's pre-diabetes,

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:24.620
 a high fasting insulin, a HOMA-IR over two,

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:27.260
 a fasting insulin of over six.

1:00:27.260 --> 1:00:30.520
 So if you have significant insulin resistance

1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:34.780
 and also androgen dominance, that's a sign of it.

1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:36.380
 Androgen dominance often leads

1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:38.700
 to what's called oligominorrhea.

1:00:38.700 --> 1:00:42.120
 So if you're having more than 35 day intervals

1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:44.060
 in between a period,

1:00:44.060 --> 1:00:47.740
 or if you have less than nine per year,

1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:49.980
 then that can be a sign that you have oligo,

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:54.380
 which means too little, menorrhea, which means menses.

1:00:54.380 --> 1:00:58.020
 So that's a very common sign of PCOS.

1:00:58.020 --> 1:01:01.460
 If you have infertility, so if you're under the age of 35

1:01:01.460 --> 1:01:04.080
 and you've been trying for more than a year,

1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:05.540
 or if you're over the age of 35

1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:07.800
 and you've been trying for more than six months,

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:08.820
 then that can also be,

1:01:08.820 --> 1:01:10.720
 it's a very common presenting complaint

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.820
 when somebody presents with PCOS.

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:16.540
 And assuming that a woman is doing all these other things,

1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:18.180
 is paying attention to the six pillars

1:01:18.180 --> 1:01:19.400
 that you talked about earlier,

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:21.980
 diet, exercise, caloric restriction, in some cases, right?

1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:24.420
 Not everyone needs to be caloric restricted,

1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:27.500
 stress, sleep, and sunlight, spirit.

1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:30.060
 Assuming that they're doing all those things,

1:01:30.060 --> 1:01:33.300
 what other things in the realm of diet or supplementation

1:01:33.300 --> 1:01:37.420
 can help them avoid PCOS if they have subclinical PCOS

1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:40.500
 or they have not developed it but don't want to develop it?

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:42.780
 Because it doesn't sound like a good thing.

1:01:42.780 --> 1:01:45.540
 Yeah, so depending on where they are,

1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:49.340
 if they're very strong on the insulin resistance spectrum,

1:01:49.340 --> 1:01:52.340
 then optimizing their body composition,

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:53.820
 decreasing their body fat,

1:01:53.820 --> 1:01:56.680
 and treating that metabolic syndrome can help.

1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:00.600
 So a lot of people ask, well, does everybody that's on,

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:04.160
 like does everybody need to be on metformin that has PCOS?

1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:06.880
 Not necessarily, but metformin is one of the tools

1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:10.080
 that can help with insulin sensitization.

1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:12.860
 Other tools that can help are inositol.

1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:16.220
 So myoinositol is an insulin sensitizer.

1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:21.220
 Its cousin, d-chiroinositol, is a weak anti-androgen.

1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:26.800
 A lot of types of inositol have both of those in it.

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:29.920
 So depending on if you're a female or a male

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:33.460
 and you're on inositol, the type of inositol does matter.

1:02:33.460 --> 1:02:35.620
 Yeah, this is a very important point.

1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:40.620
 Just today I said I'm trying this new supplement, inositol,

1:02:41.580 --> 1:02:45.460
 for its role in perhaps enhancing sleep even further.

1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:46.780
 My sleep's generally pretty good.

1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:48.620
 Lately it's been a little bit off for a number of reasons.

1:02:48.620 --> 1:02:50.620
 So I took it for the first time last night

1:02:50.620 --> 1:02:54.500
 and I said I thought it helped and just subjectively.

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:56.980
 And you said, what kind of inositol is it?

1:02:56.980 --> 1:03:00.180
 Because inositol is a very potent androgen inhibitor.

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:02.600
 It turns out I was taking myoinositol,

1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:05.140
 which is not an androgen inhibitor.

1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:06.980
 The type, the other type that you mentioned,

1:03:06.980 --> 1:03:09.260
 which is an androgen inhibitor is?

1:03:09.260 --> 1:03:11.140
 D-chiroinositol.

1:03:11.140 --> 1:03:15.340
 It's usually in a ratio of one to 25 or one to 40

1:03:15.340 --> 1:03:18.500
 in a much lower amount compared to myoinositol.

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:20.100
 In a supplement or in the body?

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:23.340
 In a supplement to help induce ovulation.

1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:26.660
 But for women who have PCOS who might want to try

1:03:26.660 --> 1:03:31.300
 and reduce androgen, then they would perhaps want

1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:32.600
 to take a form of inositol

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:35.060
 that reduce the androgen receptor activity, correct?

1:03:35.060 --> 1:03:35.980
 They want both.

1:03:35.980 --> 1:03:38.340
 So if you're a woman and you've ever talked to your doctor

1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:40.820
 about getting it on the oral contraceptive

1:03:40.820 --> 1:03:43.680
 or spironolactone, which is also an anti-androgen,

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:46.660
 but it happens to be a potassium sparing diuretic

1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:48.260
 blood pressure medicine as well.

1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:51.820
 D-chiroinositol might be a better option.

1:03:51.820 --> 1:03:55.980
 DIM or diindomethane is another kind of a weak

1:03:55.980 --> 1:03:58.660
 anti-estrogen, anti-androgen that a lot of women

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.260
 should consider as well.

1:04:00.260 --> 1:04:02.700
 You mentioned oral contraception.

1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:07.100
 I've done a few posts on these, let's just call them,

1:04:07.100 --> 1:04:09.780
 they really are perceptual effects whereby

1:04:09.780 --> 1:04:12.100
 it's been demonstrated in humans several times now

1:04:12.100 --> 1:04:14.780
 in what appeared to me to be very solid studies

1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:19.220
 where women that take oral contraceptives,

1:04:19.220 --> 1:04:23.300
 there is both a shift in their perception of men,

1:04:23.300 --> 1:04:25.900
 because these studies only looked at heterosexual,

1:04:27.020 --> 1:04:28.760
 the sort of arrangements here,

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.700
 where women who are on oral contraception,

1:04:32.700 --> 1:04:35.200
 because it blunts some of the peaks and valleys

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:40.200
 of hormone output, no longer experience the same peaks

1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:43.980
 and valleys in their assessment of other men's

1:04:43.980 --> 1:04:47.240
 attractiveness, so it sort of flattens their perception,

1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:48.080
 so to speak.

1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:49.480
 They still find certain men attractive

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:54.000
 and certain men unattractive, but the degree of difference

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.100
 is kind of mellowed out.

1:04:56.100 --> 1:05:00.820
 And likewise, these data say that men

1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:04.720
 perceiving women's attractiveness,

1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:07.840
 they still see women on oral contraceptives as attractive,

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:12.240
 but a woman taking oral contraception eliminates

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:14.460
 this kind of peak in her attractiveness

1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:16.160
 that men would otherwise perceive.

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.200
 In other words, oral contraceptives are changing the way

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:20.000
 that we perceive each other, at least in terms

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.420
 of these male-female experiments.

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:25.480
 What is going on with that?

1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:29.800
 Is that because oral contraceptives blunt the increase

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:32.980
 in testosterone that occurs just before ovulation,

1:05:32.980 --> 1:05:35.000
 or is it because of a complex cascade?

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:35.880
 What is going on?

1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:37.200
 I find this fascinating.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.120
 Yeah, so there's differences in how your,

1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:43.720
 and I wouldn't use the word change necessarily,

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:48.720
 but alter the severity or alter the peak, as you said.

1:05:50.220 --> 1:05:52.940
 So it's just like TRT is not going to change you

1:05:52.940 --> 1:05:55.440
 as a person, an oral contraceptive will not change you

1:05:55.440 --> 1:05:56.520
 as a person.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:06:01.160
 It will just change your day-to-day peaks and troughs

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:06.160
 in libido and attractiveness.

1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:09.240
 So one of the main effects of oral contraceptives,

1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:11.640
 almost all of them have a synthetic estrogen

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.220
 and a synthetic progestogen in them.

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:18.120
 One common type of synthetic estrogen is ethyl estradiol.

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.440
 There is another new synthetic estrogen

1:06:20.440 --> 1:06:22.580
 that's out there as well, but anecdotally,

1:06:22.580 --> 1:06:24.840
 that seems to have even more side effects.

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:29.240
 So this ethyl estradiol is 100 times more potent

1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:33.320
 than endogenous or bio-identical estradiol in the liver.

1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:36.560
 So it binds to the estrogen receptor in the liver,

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:39.720
 and it's going to increase sex hormone binding globulin,

1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:41.680
 which secondarily, as you mentioned,

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.760
 decreases your free testosterone

1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:46.380
 and especially your free DHT.

1:06:46.380 --> 1:06:49.240
 So that little testosterone hump that you get

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:51.280
 when you're a female that's ovulating,

1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:53.000
 that's really flatlined.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.920
 And it's already, it's a pretty insignificant difference.

1:06:56.920 --> 1:06:59.800
 It's not negligible, but it's a little bit of a hump,

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:02.180
 and you have significantly less of that

1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:03.800
 when you're on an oral contraceptive.

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:06.320
 And does that blunt the associated increase in libido

1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:10.040
 that normally would occur from that increase in androgen?

1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:10.880
 Yes.

1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:11.800
 Interesting.

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:13.820
 What about other forms of contraception, right?

1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:16.160
 Because there are, there's copper IUD,

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:19.800
 there's various implants, there's rings,

1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:23.400
 there's a huge number of different forms of these.

1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:26.240
 So what we're talking about is, as I understand it,

1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:30.480
 is only the effect of oral contraception

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.960
 that impacts hormone output, is that correct?

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:35.820
 Yeah, there's a lot of other effects as well.

1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.360
 For example, your choice of synthetic progestin

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:43.020
 will alter how high your platelets and SHBG go.

1:07:43.020 --> 1:07:46.520
 It appears to be the higher your platelets

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.160
 and the higher your SHBG, the higher risk of a blood clot.

1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:51.880
 So a lot of women know that

1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:53.480
 if they're on an oral contraceptive

1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:56.120
 and they're already predisposed to a blood clot

1:07:56.120 --> 1:07:58.940
 or a venous thromboembolism in their vein,

1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:01.580
 they have a blood clot in either their leg or their lung,

1:08:01.580 --> 1:08:03.880
 then it can increase that chance.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:06.980
 So you can choose a synthetic progestin

1:08:06.980 --> 1:08:10.320
 that is not going to have as high of a response.

1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:13.040
 But there's various pros and cons.

1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:16.900
 Some synthetic progestins are weak anti-androgens as well.

1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:19.280
 For example, there's one known as Slind,

1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:21.680
 which is made from spironolactone.

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:26.160
 So some women are on spironolactone and that as well,

1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:27.360
 which is made from spironolactone,

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.680
 which probably isn't particularly necessary

1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:32.340
 unless they need it for a diuretic or hypertensive effect.

1:08:32.340 --> 1:08:33.180
 I see.

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:36.080
 I'm just going to intentionally interrupt and I apologize,

1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:39.460
 but specifically because I wanted to ask about,

1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:43.980
 there is this notion that, you know,

1:08:43.980 --> 1:08:46.820
 that oral contraception taken over long periods of time

1:08:46.820 --> 1:08:50.040
 can disrupt fertility in ways that are independent

1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:54.540
 of just the age-related decrease in fertility.

1:08:54.540 --> 1:08:56.100
 Is that true?

1:08:56.100 --> 1:08:58.060
 It depends on what you mean by a long time.

1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:00.420
 Six to 12 months, it's possible.

1:09:00.420 --> 1:09:03.540
 Past that, it seems very unlikely.

1:09:03.540 --> 1:09:06.940
 However, the persistently elevated SHBG

1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:08.740
 can be present for quite some time.

1:09:08.740 --> 1:09:11.260
 Wait, so if a woman takes oral contraception

1:09:11.260 --> 1:09:13.740
 for six to 12 months and then stops,

1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:17.420
 will she essentially be where she would have been anyway

1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:19.780
 in terms of her fertility at that age?

1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:22.880
 Or are you saying that it can cause permanent damage?

1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:25.320
 Her fertility would be equitable

1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:26.860
 as if she had never taken it,

1:09:26.860 --> 1:09:29.780
 if she's certainly 12 months, but probably six months off.

1:09:29.780 --> 1:09:30.920
 And what if she,

1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:32.800
 I know of women that have taken an oral contraception

1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:34.700
 for many years,

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:37.000
 in addition to the age-related decline in fertility

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.280
 that occurs, that's inevitable.

1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:40.740
 Of course, the slope is going to be different

1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:42.600
 depending on the individual,

1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:47.600
 but are they quickening the transition to infertility?

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:51.740
 Probably not.

1:09:52.780 --> 1:09:54.300
 You could make a case that

1:09:54.300 --> 1:09:56.940
 because they've been an oral contraceptive,

1:09:56.940 --> 1:09:59.780
 they may have been slightly more predisposed

1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:04.780
 to insulin resistance and or lower lean body mass.

1:10:04.780 --> 1:10:08.820
 But that's probably going to be a negligible difference

1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:10.460
 compared to their resistance training

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:13.740
 and also their caloric restriction or caloric maintenance.

1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:14.580
 So-

1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:16.040
 Of course, there are also effects of having children.

1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:16.880
 Yeah.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:17.700
 Yeah, right.

1:10:17.700 --> 1:10:18.880
 I mean, on all these parameters, right?

1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:21.820
 Because it's a major lifestyle shift, right?

1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:25.340
 That obviously people contend with

1:10:25.340 --> 1:10:29.100
 and have since the beginning of human time anyway.

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:34.140
 I want to ask some questions about male hormone therapy

1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:35.300
 and male hormones generally.

1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:36.300
 But before I do that,

1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:39.800
 I have a couple of burning questions that I get very often

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:41.500
 that I'm just going to insert now.

1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:43.900
 Marijuana.

1:10:44.820 --> 1:10:47.620
 I've heard that it can decrease testosterone

1:10:47.620 --> 1:10:48.780
 in men and women.

1:10:48.780 --> 1:10:51.940
 I've heard that it can increase testosterone.

1:10:51.940 --> 1:10:53.360
 Alcohol.

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:55.900
 I think there's general consensus that

1:10:55.900 --> 1:10:59.820
 high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake

1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:01.740
 does in fact reduce testosterone.

1:11:01.740 --> 1:11:03.700
 What about modest increase of alcohol?

1:11:03.700 --> 1:11:04.540
 I'm not a drinker.

1:11:04.540 --> 1:11:06.020
 So I'm not asking these questions for me.

1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:07.460
 I don't smoke pot quite open.

1:11:07.460 --> 1:11:10.060
 I just never really liked marijuana or alcohol.

1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:11.180
 They're not my thing.

1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:14.180
 But many people want to know the answers to these.

1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:17.140
 And the data that I've seen are very confused

1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:18.360
 and conflicting.

1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:19.300
 So what about marijuana?

1:11:19.300 --> 1:11:23.440
 Does it reduce testosterone to a significant degree or not?

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:27.260
 Cannabinoids itself, whether it's THC or CBD

1:11:27.260 --> 1:11:30.720
 are not going to reduce testosterone by themselves.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.940
 If it's smoked marijuana,

1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:36.620
 then it's very likely to increase your aromatase,

1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:39.300
 which increases your estrogen.

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:43.340
 And that's going to, it's aromatizing from testosterone.

1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:45.740
 So that is going to decrease testosterone.

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:49.260
 When you have an increased estrogen, like estradiol,

1:11:49.260 --> 1:11:51.060
 that's going to work on your pituitary

1:11:51.060 --> 1:11:55.260
 to make less hormones that cause the release of testosterone.

1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:58.900
 So you're going to have less LH and less FSH.

1:11:58.900 --> 1:12:00.940
 So it's almost kind of like,

1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:04.960
 opiates are well known to opiate agonists.

1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:08.380
 They're going to decrease LH and FSH

1:12:08.380 --> 1:12:09.900
 and subsequently testosterone.

1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:12.560
 Smoked marijuana will as well.

1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:13.880
 As far as alcohol,

1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:15.860
 high alcohol will decrease testosterone

1:12:15.860 --> 1:12:19.180
 as will any very potent GABA agonist,

1:12:19.180 --> 1:12:21.380
 whether it's a barbiturate or a benzodiazepine

1:12:21.380 --> 1:12:24.440
 or a non-benzo or alcohol, they're definitely going to.

1:12:25.380 --> 1:12:26.980
 Moderate alcohol, I guess it depends

1:12:26.980 --> 1:12:28.700
 on what your definition of that is.

1:12:28.700 --> 1:12:29.540
 The American-

1:12:29.540 --> 1:12:32.340
 I mean, like some people I know

1:12:32.340 --> 1:12:33.980
 that don't seem to be alcoholics,

1:12:33.980 --> 1:12:36.700
 at least by my assessment,

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:40.900
 will have a glass or two of wine four nights a week,

1:12:40.900 --> 1:12:43.620
 which to me seems like a tremendous amount

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:46.060
 only because I don't like alcohol.

1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:48.100
 I don't have a problem with other people liking alcohol,

1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:50.300
 but I think for many people,

1:12:50.300 --> 1:12:52.780
 that would be considered low or moderate intake.

1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:55.580
 Yeah, I would consider that low intake.

1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:57.980
 The American Heart Association for Men

1:12:57.980 --> 1:13:02.220
 recommends between one and two drinks a day on average.

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:03.300
 They recommend it?

1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:04.700
 Yeah, so around one per week.

1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:06.380
 Wait, so I'm making my heart less healthy

1:13:06.380 --> 1:13:07.740
 by not drinking alcohol?

1:13:07.740 --> 1:13:10.500
 Yeah, they recommend a very low amount

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:12.260
 of alcohol intake for men.

1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:14.760
 For women, they recommend zero to one.

1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:17.220
 So that's kind of hard to interpret, zero to one.

1:13:18.220 --> 1:13:20.460
 But the protective effect of alcohol,

1:13:20.460 --> 1:13:25.360
 especially if it's a red wine with polyphenols in it,

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:28.460
 outweighs the deleterious effect.

1:13:28.460 --> 1:13:29.820
 Interesting, because I've seen some studies

1:13:29.820 --> 1:13:34.540
 that point to the idea that even low intake of alcohol

1:13:34.540 --> 1:13:35.660
 over a prolonged period of time

1:13:35.660 --> 1:13:37.940
 might actually decrease brain volume,

1:13:37.940 --> 1:13:39.860
 or at least volume of particular brain areas.

1:13:39.860 --> 1:13:41.160
 But of course, we don't know the consequence

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:44.460
 of decreasing the volume of a given brain area either.

1:13:44.460 --> 1:13:46.180
 I mean, one can imagine it's decreasing the size

1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:47.900
 of one's amygdala and making them less stressed,

1:13:47.900 --> 1:13:49.660
 although there's no evidence to support that.

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:52.160
 I've been told that I need a drink many, many times,

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:54.620
 but I always reply that I don't need to drink anything

1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:55.800
 in order to speak my mind.

1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:59.020
 So again, individual differences.

1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:01.720
 Very interesting, so it sounds like smoked marijuana

1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:04.260
 may in fact reduce testosterone,

1:14:04.260 --> 1:14:06.020
 or at least increase the conversion

1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:07.820
 of testosterone to estrogen, correct?

1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:08.660
 Okay.

1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:10.060
 And with alcohol and gaba agonist,

1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:12.800
 it's important to remember that it shouldn't be daily.

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.820
 So one drink of alcohol a day

1:14:14.820 --> 1:14:17.540
 is actually very mildly immunosuppressive.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:20.820
 So it's better to have two drinks of alcohol

1:14:20.820 --> 1:14:23.740
 one day of the week, and then two more drinks of alcohol

1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:24.700
 another day of the week,

1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:26.940
 and then no alcohol the rest of the time.

1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:29.060
 The same could be said even for supplements

1:14:29.060 --> 1:14:30.340
 that have gaba in them.

1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:33.460
 A lot of sleep supplements have immunobutyric acid,

1:14:33.460 --> 1:14:34.300
 which is gaba.

1:14:34.300 --> 1:14:35.540
 I occasionally take, oh, sorry to interrupt.

1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:39.100
 I occasionally take 100 to 200 milligrams of gaba

1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:40.120
 in order to enhance sleep,

1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:42.760
 but I do it maybe every third or four nights,

1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:45.260
 no more than three or four nights a week.

1:14:45.260 --> 1:14:46.940
 Yeah, that's perfect.

1:14:46.940 --> 1:14:48.780
 So there's a lot of sleep supplements

1:14:48.780 --> 1:14:51.100
 that should not be taken daily.

1:14:51.100 --> 1:14:52.660
 And gaba is one of them.

1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:55.520
 Another one of them is trazodone.

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:58.620
 And melatonin is kind of arguable,

1:14:58.620 --> 1:15:00.600
 and it depends on the situation.

1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:02.860
 But in general, if you're taking a sleep supplement,

1:15:02.860 --> 1:15:05.020
 it should not be taken every night.

1:15:05.020 --> 1:15:07.520
 The sleep supplements that I understand are okay

1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:10.080
 to take every night or nearly every night

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:13.400
 are things like magnesium threonate, apigenin.

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:15.700
 If that's not true, correct me.

1:15:15.700 --> 1:15:16.940
 I certainly take them every night

1:15:16.940 --> 1:15:20.140
 unless I forget them back home when I'm traveling.

1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:21.900
 Magnesium is one of the exceptions.

1:15:21.900 --> 1:15:24.680
 L-theanine is also another exception.

1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:26.420
 Great, well then at least I haven't put anything

1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:30.380
 into the world that's wrong in that category yet.

1:15:31.220 --> 1:15:32.140
 And hopefully I won't.

1:15:32.140 --> 1:15:34.340
 But if I do, I'll correct myself.

1:15:34.340 --> 1:15:37.220
 So let's talk about testosterone in males.

1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:40.900
 You see these headlines all the times now

1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:43.960
 that testosterone levels are dropping,

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.460
 sperm counts are dropping,

1:15:46.660 --> 1:15:49.180
 phenotypes of men are changing over time.

1:15:49.180 --> 1:15:51.700
 And I can't quite follow the literature on that

1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:55.860
 because obviously those are hard controlled experiments to do

1:15:55.860 --> 1:15:58.660
 because techniques change over time

1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:01.140
 and sensitivity of techniques change over time.

1:16:01.140 --> 1:16:05.020
 But regardless, I'm aware that a lot of people

1:16:05.020 --> 1:16:08.180
 are considering increasing their testosterone

1:16:08.180 --> 1:16:09.780
 by taking testosterone.

1:16:09.780 --> 1:16:12.260
 A few years ago, that was considered steroid use

1:16:12.260 --> 1:16:14.760
 and it was really extreme kind of stance.

1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:17.500
 Nowadays, it seems like there's more discussion about it.

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:18.900
 First off, I'd like to know,

1:16:18.900 --> 1:16:22.740
 does testosterone supplementation,

1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:25.540
 and here I'm talking about prescription from a doctor,

1:16:25.540 --> 1:16:28.700
 does it make one more prone to prostate cancer?

1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:31.780
 That seems to always be the first question that comes out.

1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:33.700
 Yeah, and there is a huge amount

1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:35.820
 of misinformation about this too.

1:16:35.820 --> 1:16:40.140
 So testosterone is not going to cause a prostate cancer.

1:16:40.140 --> 1:16:43.820
 However, normal aging causes prostate cancer

1:16:43.820 --> 1:16:47.380
 and testosterone will grow your prostate cancer.

1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:52.380
 So if you're a 80 year old male and you have an autopsy

1:16:52.820 --> 1:16:54.820
 and there's at least a 50% chance

1:16:54.820 --> 1:16:56.480
 that you have a prostate cancer,

1:16:56.480 --> 1:16:58.180
 if you're 90 or a hundred years old,

1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.580
 there's at least a 90% chance.

1:17:00.580 --> 1:17:04.140
 So for humans with a prostate,

1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:07.660
 it's only a matter of time until you get a prostate cancer.

1:17:07.660 --> 1:17:08.860
 So that begs the question,

1:17:08.860 --> 1:17:11.140
 do you want to take something that's going to grow it

1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:13.820
 for sure once you have it?

1:17:13.820 --> 1:17:15.980
 So it's an individual assessment

1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:18.840
 and it's important to follow things like PSAs as well.

1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:21.820
 So a PSA of four or less,

1:17:21.820 --> 1:17:23.160
 I mean, ideally you wouldn't be at four

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:24.740
 because that's kind of the upper threshold,

1:17:24.740 --> 1:17:27.200
 is the simplest readout of whether or not

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:29.800
 there's excessive prostate growth.

1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:31.500
 There's benign prostate hyperplasia

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.340
 where the prostate is growing,

1:17:33.340 --> 1:17:35.740
 but it's non-cancerous, correct?

1:17:35.740 --> 1:17:37.660
 And then of course there are the symptomologies,

1:17:37.660 --> 1:17:39.620
 like people have challenges of urination,

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:42.060
 they have sexual difficulties, et cetera.

1:17:42.060 --> 1:17:45.180
 I'm always struck by the correlation

1:17:45.180 --> 1:17:48.460
 that people draw between testosterone and prostate health

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:50.780
 and the fact that, or I should say the claim

1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:52.660
 that testosterone makes prostate health worse,

1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:53.940
 because if you think about it,

1:17:53.940 --> 1:17:57.340
 young males have high testosterone often,

1:17:57.340 --> 1:18:00.140
 if not always, certainly often,

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:04.140
 and you don't see a lot of prostate overgrowth

1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:05.860
 and cancer in young males.

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:07.640
 So something's going on here.

1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:10.020
 How should we conceptualize this?

1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:12.820
 So if you have a PSA of 3.9

1:18:12.820 --> 1:18:16.540
 and you're a 25-year-old male

1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:19.500
 versus a 75-year-old male,

1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:21.500
 and you have a PSA of 5.9,

1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:25.260
 the 3.9 PSA is significantly more concerning.

1:18:25.260 --> 1:18:29.380
 So think of your prostate as taking cumulative damage

1:18:29.380 --> 1:18:31.380
 from not only testosterone,

1:18:31.380 --> 1:18:34.920
 but also estrogen and also growth hormone.

1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:37.180
 So that's why obese individuals

1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:39.900
 have higher incidences of prostate cancer as well,

1:18:39.900 --> 1:18:42.900
 is because they don't have those cell checkpoints

1:18:42.900 --> 1:18:46.340
 where your immune system takes a second

1:18:46.340 --> 1:18:48.660
 and says, all right, stop replicating

1:18:48.660 --> 1:18:50.500
 as fast prostate cells.

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.080
 Let's see if there's any atypical ones,

1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:53.620
 and then it finds those

1:18:53.620 --> 1:18:56.100
 and it prevents them from reproducing.

1:18:56.100 --> 1:18:58.480
 That's why immunotherapy and cancer is so promising,

1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:01.600
 is because they can target these certain things.

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.020
 So the older male is going to have

1:19:05.020 --> 1:19:07.820
 that cumulative damage happen already,

1:19:07.820 --> 1:19:11.980
 and arguably prostate cancer is a normal,

1:19:15.060 --> 1:19:18.860
 with aging, fast aging is abnormal,

1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:21.780
 very slow aging is normal.

1:19:21.780 --> 1:19:25.220
 There's a fine line to walk between those two,

1:19:25.220 --> 1:19:27.300
 but there's a lot of things that can be done

1:19:27.300 --> 1:19:30.220
 to decrease the turnover, decrease the inflammation,

1:19:30.220 --> 1:19:33.900
 and decrease the congestion of the prostate over time.

1:19:33.900 --> 1:19:36.300
 There's also a lot more than just PSAs that can be done.

1:19:36.300 --> 1:19:38.420
 There's prostate MRIs and things like that.

1:19:38.420 --> 1:19:40.060
 They can look at the structure

1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:41.300
 and the function of the prostate.

1:19:41.300 --> 1:19:42.580
 So what should every male do

1:19:42.580 --> 1:19:44.300
 to maintain the health of their prostate?

1:19:44.300 --> 1:19:45.460
 And I realized that younger males

1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:46.700
 probably aren't thinking about it at all,

1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:48.900
 although it seems like nowadays,

1:19:48.900 --> 1:19:52.500
 I get these kind of what I call cryptic questions.

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:54.060
 I think women are more comfortable talking

1:19:54.060 --> 1:19:55.580
 about their hormone and sexual health

1:19:55.580 --> 1:19:59.020
 because of menstrual cycles.

1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:02.160
 They're used to fluctuations that sort of give them

1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:04.140
 the experience of what it's like to have different levels

1:20:04.140 --> 1:20:06.620
 of progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.

1:20:06.620 --> 1:20:08.460
 I get these kind of cryptic questions

1:20:08.460 --> 1:20:10.040
 often in my direct messages,

1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:12.680
 where what I think people are asking is,

1:20:14.660 --> 1:20:16.180
 is there something wrong with my prostate?

1:20:16.180 --> 1:20:17.540
 What should I do for my prostate?

1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:18.720
 These are often indirect questions

1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:21.580
 for other aspects of their life where they're suffering.

1:20:21.580 --> 1:20:23.300
 And I don't say that in jest.

1:20:23.300 --> 1:20:26.740
 I think more direct discussion would be great.

1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:31.740
 So what should all males do to maintain prostate health

1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:34.220
 throughout the lifespan?

1:20:34.220 --> 1:20:36.300
 Maintaining prostate health can be looked at

1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:38.020
 similarly how you can maintain

1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:40.920
 a good natural optimal testosterone.

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:42.660
 So you look for things that can hurt it.

1:20:42.660 --> 1:20:44.980
 You don't necessarily look for one thing

1:20:44.980 --> 1:20:47.300
 that can improve it or boost it.

1:20:47.300 --> 1:20:50.980
 So for young males, those are prostatitis.

1:20:50.980 --> 1:20:54.120
 So it goes hand in hand with epididymitis.

1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:56.920
 So different infections of the prostate.

1:20:56.920 --> 1:20:59.220
 The younger the male is, the more likely it is

1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:00.740
 related to something that could be

1:21:00.740 --> 1:21:02.940
 sexually transmitted.

1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:05.940
 But another very common cause is what we call

1:21:05.940 --> 1:21:08.920
 gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.

1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:13.920
 The prostate is right by the end of the colon.

1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:16.840
 So if you have chronic constipation,

1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:18.880
 or if you have colitis,

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.660
 or if you have, you know,

1:21:20.660 --> 1:21:23.140
 even just an E. coli overgrowth in the colon

1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:25.940
 is very likely to cause an infection

1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:27.580
 of the prostate as well.

1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:30.140
 What should males do to prevent that?

1:21:30.140 --> 1:21:34.460
 Have a diet that has good healthy prebiotic fiber,

1:21:34.460 --> 1:21:35.940
 probiotics as well.

1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:39.260
 Make sure that they're having regular bowel movements,

1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:41.580
 that they don't have chronic constipation.

1:21:41.580 --> 1:21:43.500
 Have good sources of dietary fiber,

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:45.300
 which is also known as soluble fiber,

1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:47.000
 and enough insoluble fiber.

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.600
 Most people get enough insoluble or non-dietary fiber.

1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:54.900
 So that can help prevent the chance of diverticulitis,

1:21:54.900 --> 1:21:57.360
 which is another type of infection.

1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:59.800
 It can also decrease the chance of colitis

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:02.860
 and decrease the chance of prostate infections as well.

1:22:02.860 --> 1:22:06.260
 Are there any foods and or supplements

1:22:06.260 --> 1:22:08.420
 that men should take or avoid?

1:22:08.420 --> 1:22:10.520
 What about, you hear about salt palmetto.

1:22:12.260 --> 1:22:13.980
 Yeah, supplements for,

1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:18.500
 supplements that support or cause issues for the prostate.

1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:19.340
 Yeah.

1:22:19.340 --> 1:22:21.340
 If there's a strong genetic predisposition

1:22:21.340 --> 1:22:23.580
 to enlarged prostates,

1:22:23.580 --> 1:22:27.320
 or even just really early prostate cancers that grow fast,

1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:29.940
 then they could consider taking salt palmetto

1:22:29.940 --> 1:22:32.180
 or even curcumin as an anti-androgen,

1:22:32.180 --> 1:22:33.940
 as long as they're able to tolerate it.

1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:37.260
 It's an individualized basis and depends on their history.

1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:42.820
 As far as making sure that their prostate is not congested,

1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:44.660
 there's an interesting correlation

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:49.020
 between having girls and having prostate cancer.

1:22:49.020 --> 1:22:50.320
 Having girls offspring.

1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:53.220
 So if your offspring are females,

1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:56.840
 then you're slightly more likely to have prostate cancer.

1:22:56.840 --> 1:23:01.300
 There is some, there's hypotheses that link estrogen

1:23:01.300 --> 1:23:04.380
 to prostate cancer rather than testosterone.

1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:06.800
 So if you have hyper estrogenism,

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:10.700
 your prostate has more atypical cells.

1:23:10.700 --> 1:23:13.660
 In general, the higher your C-reactive protein,

1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:16.020
 which is a general marker of inflammation in your body,

1:23:16.020 --> 1:23:17.980
 we call it CRP,

1:23:17.980 --> 1:23:22.900
 and the test order is HS-CRP or high sensitivity CRP.

1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:26.260
 If your CRP raises up very high,

1:23:26.260 --> 1:23:27.940
 if you have an autoimmune disease,

1:23:27.940 --> 1:23:29.820
 like if you have a Crohn's flare,

1:23:29.820 --> 1:23:33.020
 or if you have a lupus or an infection

1:23:33.020 --> 1:23:35.580
 or a sexually transmitted infection

1:23:35.580 --> 1:23:38.180
 or even a colitis or even the flu,

1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:40.500
 your CRP is going to raise significantly.

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:42.140
 That you would detect in a blood test, of course.

1:23:42.140 --> 1:23:42.980
 Correct, yeah.

1:23:42.980 --> 1:23:44.660
 So you want to get a baseline CRP

1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.980
 when you haven't had any of those things recently.

1:23:47.980 --> 1:23:49.980
 And if your CRP is higher,

1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:52.720
 you also have more female offspring.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:56.820
 If your CRP is higher, then your reactive oxygen species,

1:23:56.820 --> 1:23:58.580
 which are causing mutations

1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:01.140
 and atypical cell turnover in the prostate,

1:24:01.140 --> 1:24:02.740
 are also likely higher.

1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:05.460
 So you want to keep a very low CRP.

1:24:05.460 --> 1:24:06.280
 Interesting.

1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:09.340
 And what about blood flow and pelvic floor in general?

1:24:09.340 --> 1:24:11.380
 We should probably do a whole episode on pelvic floor.

1:24:11.380 --> 1:24:14.620
 You know, there's so much interesting data coming out

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:17.640
 of the fields of clinical and research urology.

1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:19.140
 I realize it's kind of the Netherlands

1:24:19.140 --> 1:24:20.780
 of biology and medicine.

1:24:20.780 --> 1:24:22.460
 People probably aren't thinking so much about this,

1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:26.260
 but pelvic floor is obviously a confluence

1:24:26.260 --> 1:24:29.380
 of a ton of vasculature, of nerves.

1:24:29.380 --> 1:24:31.100
 And of course the prostate resides there.

1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:33.820
 And of course the genitals reside there as well.

1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:38.140
 So I would imagine that one of the six pillars,

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.400
 you know, exercise,

1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:42.300
 being able to maintain adequate blood flow

1:24:42.300 --> 1:24:43.940
 to those regions is key.

1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:45.220
 What about just postural things?

1:24:45.220 --> 1:24:49.380
 People sitting too much, not hydrating well enough.

1:24:49.380 --> 1:24:51.580
 You mentioned avoiding constipation.

1:24:51.580 --> 1:24:52.720
 But what are some other things,

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:54.620
 including medications that can serve

1:24:54.620 --> 1:24:56.780
 to support the prostate over time

1:24:56.780 --> 1:24:59.340
 and maybe even support pelvic floor in general,

1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:01.660
 both in males and females over time?

1:25:01.660 --> 1:25:02.480
 Absolutely.

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.140
 And this is something that's rightfully getting

1:25:04.140 --> 1:25:05.460
 more and more attention.

1:25:05.460 --> 1:25:09.540
 The way I explain the pelvic floor is your abdominal cavity,

1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:11.100
 which includes your peritoneum

1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:12.760
 or where most of your organs are,

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:15.460
 your retroperitoneum, your pelvic space.

1:25:15.460 --> 1:25:18.740
 Think of it as a box and your abs are the front of the box.

1:25:18.740 --> 1:25:20.340
 Your back muscles are the back.

1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:22.540
 Your diaphragm is the top of the box.

1:25:22.540 --> 1:25:24.040
 And your pelvic floor,

1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:26.720
 that's where your port is to the outside world.

1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:29.660
 Especially important, it has muscles as well.

1:25:29.660 --> 1:25:31.020
 And you can do exercises.

1:25:31.020 --> 1:25:32.420
 Pelvic floor physical therapists

1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:34.380
 are becoming more and more utilized,

1:25:34.380 --> 1:25:35.760
 especially after childbirth,

1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:37.520
 but in other situations as well,

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:41.420
 including by men getting care from urologists.

1:25:41.420 --> 1:25:44.700
 So you want to both strengthen that pelvic floor

1:25:44.700 --> 1:25:48.460
 and make sure that the tubes that are docked

1:25:48.460 --> 1:25:51.780
 to the outside world are working well enough,

1:25:51.780 --> 1:25:52.740
 but they're not too loose.

1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:54.700
 They're not working too well.

1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:59.420
 So there's a lot of medications that can be positives

1:25:59.420 --> 1:26:01.820
 or negatives for your pelvic floor.

1:26:01.820 --> 1:26:03.100
 We kind of talked about your gut

1:26:03.100 --> 1:26:05.100
 and colon health in general.

1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:07.020
 As far as your prostate health,

1:26:07.020 --> 1:26:11.380
 and as far as your bladder and urinary system health,

1:26:11.380 --> 1:26:13.160
 you think about a couple of different classes.

1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:14.940
 So you have your phosphodiesterases.

1:26:14.940 --> 1:26:16.340
 You have your tadalafil.

1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:20.860
 Basically, this is going to help decrease congestion

1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:22.620
 in the prostate.

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:25.020
 A lot of people take it for ED,

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:26.820
 but it can actually help you decrease your-

1:26:26.820 --> 1:26:27.660
 Do you define that?

1:26:27.660 --> 1:26:31.580
 A lot of men take tadalafil, it's generic as Cialis,

1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:34.180
 has a much longer half-life than Viagra or Levitra.

1:26:34.180 --> 1:26:36.120
 It's half-life is almost a day.

1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:37.620
 So you can take a very low dose of it.

1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:39.080
 Instead of taking 20 milligrams,

1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:41.060
 you take two or two and a half milligrams.

1:26:41.060 --> 1:26:42.960
 So they're taking, you're saying that a lot of men

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:45.620
 take it for erectile dysfunction,

1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:49.620
 but that at lower doses, it may have served purposes

1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:53.300
 for prostate health, independent of erection.

1:26:53.300 --> 1:26:54.140
 Correct.

1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:57.940
 The most common scenario is if a male is waking up twice

1:26:57.940 --> 1:27:01.420
 at night to pee, on average, it'll cut that down to once.

1:27:01.420 --> 1:27:03.580
 So if they're waking up four times at night,

1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:05.800
 then it can cut that down to twice at night,

1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:07.460
 just because you have easier blood flow.

1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:09.820
 We used to use other medications like Flomax,

1:27:09.820 --> 1:27:11.540
 which is Tamsulosin.

1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:13.020
 That's an alpha antagonist.

1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:16.400
 So it basically binds to a receptor in smooth muscle,

1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:18.920
 and it helps relax that.

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:21.740
 There's several other alpha antagonists.

1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:23.980
 And then you also have your medications that are hormonal,

1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:26.340
 like finasteride, that a lot of people take

1:27:26.340 --> 1:27:28.620
 for prostate health to decrease the enlargement

1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:29.840
 of the prostate.

1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:33.360
 The periurethral area or periurethral lobe,

1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:35.960
 there are several lobes of the prostate,

1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:39.820
 that tends to be especially enlarged in cases of BPH.

1:27:39.820 --> 1:27:41.540
 And BPH?

1:27:41.540 --> 1:27:45.060
 Prostate hyperplasia or an enlarged prostate.

1:27:45.060 --> 1:27:48.060
 And if you are able to shrink that area,

1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:51.260
 then at that point it's just a plumbing problem,

1:27:51.260 --> 1:27:53.700
 and the urine is able to get by easier.

1:27:53.700 --> 1:27:57.260
 Yeah, my understanding is that now there's a growing,

1:27:57.260 --> 1:27:59.060
 I don't want to say a movement,

1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:03.180
 but the idea of taking very low dose,

1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:06.580
 like 2.5 milligram or five milligram to Dallafil,

1:28:06.580 --> 1:28:09.800
 even daily, is becoming pretty common.

1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:12.660
 For many men who do not have erectile dysfunction,

1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:16.100
 simply to either maintain or enhance prostate health.

1:28:16.100 --> 1:28:17.300
 Is that correct?

1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:18.120
 Yeah, that's correct.

1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:18.960
 And are there,

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:21.900
 do you see any negative effects of doing that?

1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.360
 There can be negative effects.

1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:24.820
 It can lower blood pressure.

1:28:24.820 --> 1:28:27.340
 So theoretically it can increase your chance

1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:29.460
 of vasovagal syncope.

1:28:29.460 --> 1:28:32.340
 A lot of people take it as a alternative to pump

1:28:32.340 --> 1:28:35.220
 because it kind of works similarly to citrulline

1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:38.800
 or different pump products in pre-workout.

1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:40.260
 And it can certainly help with that.

1:28:40.260 --> 1:28:42.460
 But if you're about to go do a deadlift

1:28:42.460 --> 1:28:44.020
 where you might pass that anyway,

1:28:44.020 --> 1:28:46.700
 it can certainly increase the chance that that happens

1:28:46.700 --> 1:28:47.540
 because you don't have

1:28:47.540 --> 1:28:51.460
 that compensatory exercise hypertension response.

1:28:51.460 --> 1:28:54.580
 Could someone just take it away from exercise?

1:28:54.580 --> 1:28:55.780
 They could.

1:28:55.780 --> 1:28:57.140
 If you took to Dallafil,

1:28:57.140 --> 1:28:59.140
 then that's going to be,

1:28:59.140 --> 1:29:00.980
 has a long half-life.

1:29:00.980 --> 1:29:03.780
 Whereas Viagra and Levitra is just a few hours.

1:29:03.780 --> 1:29:05.500
 Dallafil is almost today.

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:09.540
 Some interesting studies on Viagra have been done as well.

1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:13.620
 It can potentially alter your rays and cones in your eye.

1:29:13.620 --> 1:29:17.420
 So the usual recommendation for pilots

1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:19.940
 that need to have red-green discrimination

1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:23.640
 from very long distances with very small indicator lights

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:26.420
 is to not take Viagra.

1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:28.660
 So I usually say if you're a pilot

1:29:28.660 --> 1:29:29.840
 and that's your profession,

1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:31.980
 perhaps hold off from that for a while.

1:29:31.980 --> 1:29:34.980
 There's also studies with Viagra that significantly,

1:29:34.980 --> 1:29:38.620
 which is also known as sildenafil as the generic now,

1:29:38.620 --> 1:29:41.140
 it can increase eyebrow hair growth.

1:29:41.140 --> 1:29:45.420
 So potentially what it does is it helps vasodilate

1:29:45.420 --> 1:29:48.380
 and relax the veins, especially in older men.

1:29:48.380 --> 1:29:50.100
 And when those veins are relaxed,

1:29:50.100 --> 1:29:52.020
 you have better blood flow.

1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.700
 That's one of the proposals or theories

1:29:54.700 --> 1:29:59.340
 behind why older men get the androgenetic alopecia more.

1:29:59.340 --> 1:30:01.500
 You're having less blood flow in the scalp.

1:30:01.500 --> 1:30:04.260
 So theoretically it can also help prevent that.

1:30:04.260 --> 1:30:06.220
 So in theory increasing blood,

1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:08.580
 oh, because it increases blood flow systemically

1:30:08.580 --> 1:30:12.600
 throughout the body, not just in specific tissues.

1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:15.000
 Well, I find it incredibly interesting that, yeah,

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.780
 there are these online forums building up now

1:30:16.780 --> 1:30:19.540
 around low dose to dalafil,

1:30:20.860 --> 1:30:22.960
 daily use of low dose to dalafil, again,

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:26.000
 not for sexual or erectile dysfunction,

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:29.220
 but for sake of long-term prostate health.

1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:30.820
 Is there any reason why women

1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:34.900
 might want to take low dose to dalafil?

1:30:34.900 --> 1:30:39.900
 To dalafil is also a weak androgen receptor sensitizer,

1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:42.060
 kind of like L-carnitine,

1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:45.140
 where the density of the available androgen receptors

1:30:45.140 --> 1:30:48.100
 to bind increases slightly.

1:30:48.100 --> 1:30:52.540
 So there could potentially be a benefit from that,

1:30:52.540 --> 1:30:55.060
 but most of the time it's used in men.

1:30:55.060 --> 1:30:55.940
 Very interesting.

1:30:57.300 --> 1:30:59.620
 We haven't really talked about testosterone

1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:01.740
 and optimizing testosterone in males.

1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:05.760
 Assuming someone is paying attention to the six pillars,

1:31:07.620 --> 1:31:10.260
 there's a kind of a gap as I see it

1:31:10.260 --> 1:31:12.120
 between doing all those things

1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:15.820
 and TRT, hormone replacement therapy.

1:31:15.820 --> 1:31:18.940
 And again, the R, the replacement in TRT

1:31:18.940 --> 1:31:21.980
 is a little bit of a, in quotes nowadays,

1:31:21.980 --> 1:31:24.980
 because a lot of people who have testosterone

1:31:24.980 --> 1:31:28.700
 in that 300 to 900 nanogram per deciliter range

1:31:28.700 --> 1:31:30.940
 opt to take low dose testosterone anyway.

1:31:30.940 --> 1:31:35.260
 My understanding is that there've been some new kind

1:31:35.260 --> 1:31:38.120
 of movements in this area toward, for instance,

1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:43.120
 not doing big, large doses injected infrequently,

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:46.420
 but rather low doses quite frequently.

1:31:46.420 --> 1:31:47.660
 Obviously prescribed by a doctor,

1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:50.000
 monitored by a doctor, et cetera.

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.280
 Is that generally what you like to see in your patients

1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:55.400
 if they're going to take this route?

1:31:55.400 --> 1:31:58.940
 If they're a hypogonadal patient whose benefits outweigh

1:31:58.940 --> 1:32:03.240
 risks of TRT, then you want to have a nice,

1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:05.100
 even steady state.

1:32:05.100 --> 1:32:07.740
 It's not going to be exactly the same as producing

1:32:07.740 --> 1:32:11.500
 pulsatile testosterone release endogenously

1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:12.860
 from your own body.

1:32:12.860 --> 1:32:14.740
 When you have a steady state,

1:32:14.740 --> 1:32:16.340
 you don't have a peak or a trough.

1:32:16.340 --> 1:32:17.700
 And when you have a peak,

1:32:17.700 --> 1:32:20.860
 that's when the androgen receptor gene is overactive.

1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:24.220
 That's when you get more erythropoietin or EPO release.

1:32:24.220 --> 1:32:27.540
 And that leads to a lot of the side effects of thick blood.

1:32:27.540 --> 1:32:29.980
 So higher hemoglobins and hematocrits.

1:32:29.980 --> 1:32:33.900
 And then when you have a crash, you don't feel good.

1:32:33.900 --> 1:32:37.020
 So it's definitely not optimal.

1:32:37.020 --> 1:32:38.940
 There's a lot of ways to get around this.

1:32:38.940 --> 1:32:41.540
 So when you're doing testosterone replacement,

1:32:41.540 --> 1:32:43.420
 if you're someone that needs it,

1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:45.980
 you can have different types of esters,

1:32:45.980 --> 1:32:48.540
 or you could do topical testosterone.

1:32:48.540 --> 1:32:52.140
 So the ester is basically something that's attached

1:32:52.140 --> 1:32:54.760
 to increase the biological half-life.

1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:57.300
 The most common ones are cipunate and anthate.

1:32:57.300 --> 1:32:59.300
 There's also a very short-acting propionate,

1:32:59.300 --> 1:33:01.740
 which has almost no clinical relevance.

1:33:01.740 --> 1:33:03.780
 And there's also very long-acting ones,

1:33:03.780 --> 1:33:05.980
 decanoate and undecanoate,

1:33:05.980 --> 1:33:08.660
 and different mixtures of all those.

1:33:08.660 --> 1:33:12.580
 So if you're someone who has a very, very low SHBG,

1:33:12.580 --> 1:33:14.900
 you're going to have trouble of regulating

1:33:14.900 --> 1:33:17.540
 your serum testosterone in the long run.

1:33:17.540 --> 1:33:20.200
 If you do it topically, then the testosterone is absorbed,

1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:22.260
 hopefully bound to SHBG.

1:33:22.260 --> 1:33:24.140
 And then a lot of times you reapply twice daily

1:33:24.140 --> 1:33:26.940
 or once daily, but you have lots of variations.

1:33:26.940 --> 1:33:28.540
 So for most people,

1:33:28.540 --> 1:33:31.580
 especially for people who can absorb it well,

1:33:31.580 --> 1:33:33.060
 that's not going to be a great option.

1:33:33.060 --> 1:33:34.720
 So injections would be preferred.

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.660
 Most people end up injecting

1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:39.020
 because they have either side effects from too high,

1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:42.060
 too low, or just too much of a varied dose

1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:43.300
 when they do topical.

1:33:43.300 --> 1:33:47.620
 There's also a capsule with a special lymphatic absorption.

1:33:47.620 --> 1:33:49.540
 So it's not being absorbed through the liver.

1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:51.000
 It's not hepatically metabolized,

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.960
 but it's absorbed through the lymph.

1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:56.260
 And it's essentially the testosterone undecanoate

1:33:56.260 --> 1:33:58.380
 and then put into a capsule.

1:33:58.380 --> 1:34:01.260
 So, and that's taken twice daily.

1:34:01.260 --> 1:34:03.100
 It has fairly steady half-lives,

1:34:03.100 --> 1:34:05.780
 but you have to take it at specific times of the day.

1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:08.620
 So that being said, and it's new enough

1:34:08.620 --> 1:34:10.540
 to where there isn't a huge amount of data on it,

1:34:10.540 --> 1:34:12.500
 but it is FTA approved.

1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:14.900
 So it is brand name now.

1:34:14.900 --> 1:34:19.500
 It's called Jatenzo, but the injectables in general,

1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:23.260
 the lower your SHBG, the longer of an ester you want,

1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:24.900
 because when you inject it,

1:34:24.900 --> 1:34:26.940
 whether it's intramuscular or subcutaneous,

1:34:26.940 --> 1:34:28.620
 just talk to your doctor about the risks

1:34:28.620 --> 1:34:29.560
 and the benefits of those.

1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:32.100
 Subcutaneous has slightly longer active half-life

1:34:32.100 --> 1:34:34.340
 because the ester races take longer to reach

1:34:34.340 --> 1:34:37.780
 that cipunate or an ester to cleave it.

1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:41.140
 So most men, a lot of people ask me about

1:34:41.140 --> 1:34:42.520
 what a usual dose is.

1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:47.100
 For most people, it would be a total of about 100 to 120

1:34:47.100 --> 1:34:49.580
 per week for an actual replacement dose.

1:34:49.580 --> 1:34:50.420
 Milligrams.

1:34:50.420 --> 1:34:53.940
 Milligrams, 120 to 100 milligrams per week

1:34:53.940 --> 1:34:56.180
 administered two to three times per week.

1:34:56.180 --> 1:34:58.280
 And you're not, so you're saying dividing that

1:34:58.280 --> 1:34:59.620
 into two or three, right?

1:34:59.620 --> 1:35:00.860
 Because I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there

1:35:00.860 --> 1:35:02.620
 thinking, oh yeah, 100 three times a week,

1:35:02.620 --> 1:35:04.720
 which is actually quite high dose.

1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:07.220
 Yeah, there really does seem to be a shift

1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:10.800
 toward spreading these dosages out into,

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:13.540
 dividing them into two or three smaller doses.

1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:18.460
 And then along those lines, five, 10 years ago,

1:35:18.460 --> 1:35:21.020
 it was common to hear about inhibiting estrogen

1:35:21.020 --> 1:35:22.460
 through aromatase inhibitors.

1:35:22.460 --> 1:35:25.180
 Nowadays you hear, and I think it's true,

1:35:25.180 --> 1:35:27.140
 at least by my read of the literature,

1:35:27.140 --> 1:35:30.260
 that that inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function,

1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:32.180
 can cause connective tissue issues,

1:35:32.180 --> 1:35:35.180
 and even can cause reductions in libido.

1:35:35.180 --> 1:35:38.560
 So a lot of people think that estrogen,

1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:42.020
 if you crash estrogen, that basically libido goes up,

1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:43.660
 but actually the opposite is often true.

1:35:43.660 --> 1:35:45.700
 You don't want estrogen too high or too low.

1:35:45.700 --> 1:35:46.540
 Is that correct?

1:35:46.540 --> 1:35:50.940
 And for that reason, do you shy away

1:35:50.940 --> 1:35:53.780
 from people taking aromatase inhibitors?

1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:58.780
 Yeah, very few people truly need an aromatase inhibitor.

1:35:59.140 --> 1:36:01.780
 There's almost always lifestyle interventions.

1:36:01.780 --> 1:36:04.160
 It can just depend on which gene,

1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:06.300
 how active your aromatase gene is.

1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:09.180
 Some people's aromatase gene is very active.

1:36:09.180 --> 1:36:12.380
 A lot of times these individuals have

1:36:12.380 --> 1:36:15.780
 pubertal gynecomastia, which is breast tissue growth

1:36:15.780 --> 1:36:18.580
 in males, even despite no other risk factor.

1:36:18.580 --> 1:36:19.680
 Even if they're lean?

1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:22.300
 Some people get it if they're lean.

1:36:22.300 --> 1:36:24.120
 I remember growing up, there were a few kids

1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:27.820
 that got mild cases of gynecomastia that were transient.

1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:29.940
 Like it's sort of like they developed gynecomastia

1:36:29.940 --> 1:36:31.340
 and then it went away.

1:36:31.340 --> 1:36:33.880
 Often it's unilateral on one side too.

1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:38.100
 So growth hormone a lot of times is the fuel to that fire.

1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:39.220
 Oh, interesting.

1:36:39.220 --> 1:36:40.360
 Yeah, there were a couple of kids.

1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:41.780
 I mean, they took some teasing,

1:36:41.780 --> 1:36:45.060
 because back then there wasn't online discussions

1:36:45.060 --> 1:36:46.260
 about hormones and things like that,

1:36:46.260 --> 1:36:48.060
 but then it would seem transient.

1:36:48.060 --> 1:36:49.740
 And they were, the people I'm thinking of

1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:51.500
 were actually lean individuals.

1:36:51.500 --> 1:36:52.620
 So they weren't overweight,

1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:54.880
 which of course can cause gynecomastia

1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:58.500
 because adipose fat tissue can convert testosterone

1:36:58.500 --> 1:36:59.340
 into estrogen.

1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:02.460
 So it sounds like, except in special cases,

1:37:02.460 --> 1:37:05.200
 that avoiding aromatase inhibitors

1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:07.240
 is probably going to be a good idea.

1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:08.120
 There's several other ways

1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:09.620
 that you can control your estrogen

1:37:09.620 --> 1:37:11.100
 and keep it at a healthy level,

1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:12.220
 which you do have to check.

1:37:12.220 --> 1:37:14.980
 There's a lot of patients who assure me

1:37:14.980 --> 1:37:16.940
 that their estrogen is going to be sky high

1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:20.020
 and it's actually very low and vice versa.

1:37:20.020 --> 1:37:22.600
 But calcium D-glucarate is a supplement

1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:24.500
 that can help with estrogen control.

1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:26.900
 What's a typical dosage of calcium D-glucarate?

1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:28.940
 500 to 1000 milligrams.

1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:31.180
 But is there the risk that if someone's estrogen

1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:33.920
 is in normal range and they take the supplement

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:35.580
 that their estrogen will go too low,

1:37:35.580 --> 1:37:37.460
 is it that potent?

1:37:37.460 --> 1:37:38.340
 It's not that potent.

1:37:38.340 --> 1:37:40.660
 It's not near as potent as an aromatase inhibitor.

1:37:40.660 --> 1:37:42.440
 So it helps with excretion

1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:46.100
 and also the sensitivity of the estrogen receptor itself.

1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:48.740
 It kind of like helps out-compete it.

1:37:48.740 --> 1:37:50.700
 Some people will also take DIM

1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:53.920
 or different cruciferous vegetable.

1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:57.380
 They get them from cruciferous vegetables like kale

1:37:58.820 --> 1:37:59.820
 or broccoli.

1:37:59.820 --> 1:38:04.660
 And that is both an anti-estrogen and an anti-androgen.

1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:06.980
 So if you're on TRT and you're on that,

1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:09.180
 then you're probably just on too much TRT.

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:10.780
 Yeah, I remember a few years ago I had a friend

1:38:10.780 --> 1:38:13.780
 and it truly is, it's not like I have a friend's thing.

1:38:13.780 --> 1:38:15.820
 Because I'm very cautious about which supplements I take.

1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:17.500
 I think people might get the impression

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:19.620
 that I'm very cavalier about this, but I'm not.

1:38:19.620 --> 1:38:21.200
 I always alter one thing at a time.

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.320
 I talk to physicians.

1:38:23.260 --> 1:38:24.340
 What I suggest other people do,

1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:26.700
 I actually do and have done for a long period of time.

1:38:26.700 --> 1:38:30.120
 And I recall wanting to take DIM

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:31.780
 because I thought, well, back then you hear,

1:38:31.780 --> 1:38:34.080
 okay, reduce estrogen.

1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:36.540
 My estrogen levels weren't out of range, so they were fine.

1:38:36.540 --> 1:38:37.380
 But I thought, well,

1:38:37.380 --> 1:38:38.900
 what would the experience be of bringing those down?

1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:41.500
 But someone I know is quite informed in this area,

1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:42.860
 said, yeah, exactly what you said,

1:38:42.860 --> 1:38:45.540
 which is that DIM can reduce estrogen, but also testosterone.

1:38:45.540 --> 1:38:48.140
 So I just never opted to try and take it.

1:38:48.140 --> 1:38:50.420
 I do want, we're sort of erring in this direction,

1:38:50.420 --> 1:38:54.240
 but we went straight from the six pillars to TRT

1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:56.820
 or to what some people now call sports TRT,

1:38:56.820 --> 1:38:59.960
 which is basically code language for saying,

1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:02.440
 taking exogenous testosterone,

1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:05.420
 even though one doesn't need it to get into a semi

1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:09.860
 super physiological range or a high end,

1:39:09.860 --> 1:39:12.460
 like 900 to a thousand nanogram per deciliter range.

1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:14.780
 And people always point out, I should mention that,

1:39:14.780 --> 1:39:15.980
 oh, well in certain countries,

1:39:15.980 --> 1:39:18.700
 the high end range is 1200 nanograms per deciliter.

1:39:18.700 --> 1:39:19.820
 In the US it's 900.

1:39:19.820 --> 1:39:22.680
 And so if you're 1200, are you really super physiological?

1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:24.420
 All that aside,

1:39:24.420 --> 1:39:27.460
 I neglected to ask about that gap in between

1:39:27.460 --> 1:39:30.900
 where individuals could think about supplementation,

1:39:30.900 --> 1:39:32.480
 meaning non-prescription approaches

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:33.880
 to increasing testosterone.

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:36.580
 And here we should probably also talk about things like,

1:39:36.580 --> 1:39:40.520
 is it true that ice baths increase testosterone or not?

1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:43.160
 Lifestyle factors that go beyond the six pillars

1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:44.560
 for increasing testosterone.

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.520
 If you could comment on those, that would be terrific.

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:47.900
 Supplements that are useful.

1:39:47.900 --> 1:39:50.320
 And it'd be wonderful if you can mention

1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:52.620
 where some of these same practices and supplements

1:39:52.620 --> 1:39:55.100
 might be useful for women as well as men

1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:56.340
 to increase testosterone

1:39:56.340 --> 1:39:58.180
 for all the reasons we talked about earlier.

1:39:58.180 --> 1:40:01.460
 Yeah, so this is where a true individualized approach

1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:02.660
 comes in.

1:40:02.660 --> 1:40:06.480
 When you're talking about what dose of TRT you should be on,

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:07.520
 one thing to keep in mind

1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:09.280
 is the law of diminishing returns.

1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:13.880
 Quality of life is a subjective thing

1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:15.480
 and it's different for each person.

1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.860
 So some people are more willing to give up

1:40:17.860 --> 1:40:21.180
 a little bit of athleticism or body composition.

1:40:21.180 --> 1:40:22.980
 Some people are more willing to give up

1:40:22.980 --> 1:40:26.640
 or not willing to give up libido or sexual health.

1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.520
 And as we mentioned earlier,

1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:32.560
 everybody's androgen receptor is less or more sensitive.

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:36.120
 So you can make a case that if somebody's androgen receptor

1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:40.060
 is half as sensitive as somebody else,

1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:42.680
 the person with the less sensitive receptor

1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:46.620
 does need a level of 1000 or 1200.

1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:47.980
 There's no great way to know that.

1:40:47.980 --> 1:40:50.220
 And you can alter the sensitivity of your androgen receptor

1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:53.040
 with things like L-carnitine and tadalafil as mentioned.

1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:54.680
 And we'll definitely come back to L-carnitine

1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:58.220
 because I'm really intrigued by the data on L-carnitine,

1:40:58.220 --> 1:41:00.960
 both for women and men in terms of egg quality,

1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:02.160
 sperm quality, fertility,

1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:03.800
 and a bunch of other interesting effects.

1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:05.400
 So we'll come back to L-carnitine.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:09.920
 But a lot of how you feel, the biofeedback or subjective,

1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:13.360
 I feel like this comes from the ratio of your androgens

1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:14.880
 to your estrogens.

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.600
 And a lot of that is lifestyle.

1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:18.240
 So if someone's also an HCG,

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:20.640
 that could upregulate aromatase as well.

1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:25.600
 HCG, you might want to just, human chorionic gonadotropin,

1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:27.040
 found, used to be found in pregnant,

1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:28.440
 is still found in pregnant women's urine.

1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:31.280
 But used to be, believe it or not,

1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:34.540
 there was a black market for pregnant women's urine

1:41:34.540 --> 1:41:36.920
 before this stuff was developed synthetically.

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.880
 So in other words, what we're saying is,

1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:42.640
 men typically would buy pregnant women's urine

1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:46.280
 through black markets in order to get the HCG,

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:49.960
 in order to get the testosterone enhancing effects of HCG.

1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:50.800
 So in other words,

1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:52.720
 men were using pregnant women's urine for HCG.

1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:55.200
 I do not want to know how they got it into their body.

1:41:55.200 --> 1:41:57.760
 Let's just skip to what you were going to say next instead.

1:41:57.760 --> 1:41:59.920
 Yeah, so that's HCG.

1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:03.200
 There's a lot of other things that upregulate estrogen.

1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:06.680
 Alcohol significantly increases aromatase.

1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:08.240
 So if you're very sensitive to estrogen,

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:11.520
 then you probably shouldn't even consume the two glasses

1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:12.560
 three times a week.

1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:16.880
 High fat meals also upregulate aromatase.

1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:18.960
 So if you're on a ketogenic diet,

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:21.160
 but you have hyper-estrogenism,

1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:23.280
 then you should take care with that as well.

1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:25.720
 All kinds of fats or just saturated fats?

1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:27.600
 I'm not sure if it's just saturated fats,

1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:31.240
 but fat definitely increases both fat in your body

1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:34.200
 and consumption of a high amount of calories

1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:35.240
 increases aromatase.

1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:37.120
 So it's the ratio of testosterone to estrogen.

1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:38.040
 I don't want to break your flow,

1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:39.520
 but since we're talking about fat,

1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:41.640
 I have to ask since estrogen and testosterone

1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:44.200
 are both synthesized from the cholesterol molecule,

1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:49.200
 I've heard that ingesting some amount of saturated fat

1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:51.800
 can be useful because of the way that cholesterol

1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:55.200
 can serve as a precursor to these molecules.

1:42:55.200 --> 1:42:58.320
 Now, I once said on a podcast that I like butter so much

1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:00.080
 that I occasionally eat pats of butter.

1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:02.880
 Somehow that got misinterpreted to mean

1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:05.080
 that I eat entire many pats of butter.

1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:07.400
 I'm talking like one or two pats of butter here and there,

1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:08.760
 and I have no guilt or shame about it.

1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:10.480
 My blood lipids are in great shape also,

1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:11.520
 so I feel good.

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:15.200
 But is it possible that people who are ingesting

1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:20.200
 too little of saturated fats could directly or indirectly

1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:24.600
 reduce or somehow disrupt the proper ratio

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:27.040
 of testosterone to estrogen in men and women?

1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:28.520
 It's theoretically possible,

1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:31.880
 but it probably doesn't happen in developed countries,

1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:33.560
 just like it's theoretically possible

1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:36.280
 to have not enough omega-6 fatty acids,

1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:38.520
 but that probably does not happen in developed countries.

1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:40.000
 So I don't need the butter pats,

1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:41.600
 but I'm going to do it anyway.

1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:42.440
 I'm just curious.

1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:43.280
 Yeah. Okay.

1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:46.440
 Grass-fed butter has good omega-3 content as well.

1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:49.440
 So grass-fed foods in general,

1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:51.040
 you know, it's not the end all be all,

1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:53.520
 and everybody doesn't need grass-fed foods,

1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:57.320
 but they are one of the only sources of healthy trans fat.

1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:01.240
 So a naturally occurring trans fat comes from ruminants.

1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:04.400
 So ruminants that I think of like cows

1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:09.400
 and the rumination in the different stomachs

1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:12.440
 can change your omega-3 and omega-6

1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:16.800
 to trans linolenic and trans linoleic fatty acids.

1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:17.640
 Which are healthy for us.

1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:20.680
 Yeah, so it's actually omega-3s and omega-6s

1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:24.400
 that just happened to have a trans instead of a cis isomer.

1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:28.200
 So, and these healthy trans fats would be found

1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:32.280
 in ruminant cheese and milk and butter from ruminants

1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:34.440
 and the meats?

1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:35.440
 Yes.

1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:36.760
 So, and for people who are following

1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:40.920
 a purely plant-based diet or mostly plant-based diet,

1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:43.480
 are they at risk of not getting enough

1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:45.280
 of certain types of fats or other nutrients

1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:48.680
 to maintain that healthy ratio of testosterone to estrogen

1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:49.520
 or not?

1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:51.520
 If they're a vegetarian, they're probably not at risk.

1:44:51.520 --> 1:44:54.720
 If they're a vegan, they very well could be at risk.

1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:59.000
 Most vegans are aware of this very acutely

1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.480
 and they'll supplement with, you know, algae

1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:07.680
 or they'll supplement with other sources of healthy fats.

1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:08.520
 I see.

1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:10.920
 So, the takeaway that I'm drawing from this

1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:14.800
 is that less so than getting saturated fat,

1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.200
 it's key to get these healthy trans fats from ruminants

1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:21.000
 or the food products of those ruminants

1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:25.960
 as well as to get proper amounts of omega-3s.

1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:28.200
 And to be clear, you don't need any trans fats.

1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:31.520
 It just happens that those omega-3s and omega-6s

1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:33.560
 are in a trans isomer.

1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:34.400
 I see.

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:35.280
 Okay, so that's nutrition.

1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:37.120
 What other supplements can support

1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:39.640
 healthy testosterone to estrogen ratios?

1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:42.520
 Anything that alters aromatase

1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:45.320
 can support healthy testosterone to estrogen.

1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:50.320
 And your testosterone to estrogen ratio,

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:53.760
 think about it as how much estrogen activity

1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:55.840
 do you have at the beta estradiol receptor

1:45:55.840 --> 1:45:57.720
 and your alpha estradiol receptor.

1:45:57.720 --> 1:45:58.560
 How would I know that?

1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:03.480
 So, it's hard to tell, but depending on what you're eating,

1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:06.400
 if you have a lot of plant-based diets or polyphenols,

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:09.540
 many of these are beta estradiol receptors.

1:46:09.540 --> 1:46:13.320
 People know about turkestrone and also beta-ectisterone,

1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:14.880
 which are two ectisteroids

1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:17.680
 that are beta estradiol receptor agonists.

1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:20.600
 So, they activate the beta estradiol receptor.

1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:23.160
 So, if you have a very low amount of estrogen naturally,

1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:24.800
 you're probably a better candidate for it.

1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:27.720
 For taking to turkestrone or ectisterone.

1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:30.800
 I've never tried them, but I know my understanding

1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:34.000
 is that they work tremendously well for some people

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.280
 and not at all for others.

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:37.040
 And so, one just simply has to try.

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:41.400
 But in promoting the activity of this estrogen receptor,

1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:43.800
 is there a risk that turkestrone or ectisterone

1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:46.860
 could cause some of the quote-unquote problems

1:46:46.860 --> 1:46:49.800
 associated with increasing estrogen activity,

1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:52.880
 like reduced libido, water retention?

1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:57.880
 Water retention, yes. Reduced libido, probably not.

1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:00.220
 Closing growth plates in the bone, no,

1:47:00.220 --> 1:47:03.140
 because that's the alpha estradiol receptor.

1:47:03.140 --> 1:47:05.600
 I've talked before on a couple of podcasts

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:09.920
 about tonga ali, which is this Indonesian herb.

1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:13.220
 I guess it's also made and found in Malaysia,

1:47:13.220 --> 1:47:16.480
 but it seems to be the Indonesian variety of tonga ali

1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:19.180
 that's most effective for potentially

1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:21.740
 for reducing sex hormone and binding globulin

1:47:21.740 --> 1:47:24.220
 and thereby freeing up testosterone.

1:47:24.220 --> 1:47:26.380
 Whether or not the effects are through that pathway,

1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:27.740
 through another pathway,

1:47:27.740 --> 1:47:31.540
 a lot of people report improvements in things like libido

1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:36.120
 and maybe androgen-like phenotypes, right?

1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:37.660
 Feeling more vital, et cetera.

1:47:37.660 --> 1:47:40.520
 And of course, some of that could be placebo, correct?

1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:42.580
 But what are your thoughts on tonga ali?

1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:45.080
 And please challenge my statements about tonga ali

1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:45.920
 if they're incorrect.

1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:48.120
 I'm not looking for validation here.

1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:50.480
 I just really want to know what your thoughts are on it.

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.980
 Do you ever recommend it to patients?

1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:56.580
 When men, women, one or the other?

1:47:56.580 --> 1:48:00.380
 Yeah, so tongkat ali or long jack,

1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:02.420
 it has multiple mechanisms of action

1:48:02.420 --> 1:48:06.840
 and there have been several placebo-controlled studies on it.

1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:09.060
 Some of them show decrease in SHBG.

1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:12.380
 At least one of them did not show any change in SHBG.

1:48:12.380 --> 1:48:16.380
 However it is, it does act on aromatase very weakly,

1:48:16.380 --> 1:48:18.900
 probably not so strongly that you would have to be concerned

1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:20.700
 with hypoestrogenism.

1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:24.820
 So it reduces aromatase and thereby can reduce estrogen?

1:48:24.820 --> 1:48:25.640
 Correct. Okay.

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:28.540
 It's also a weak, it's not a CIRM,

1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:31.620
 so it's not a selective estrogen receptor modifier,

1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:34.960
 but it's probably a weak, it's probably an ERM as well,

1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:38.340
 or a non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.

1:48:38.340 --> 1:48:42.100
 And that should help with decreasing negative feedback

1:48:42.100 --> 1:48:45.820
 inhibition of estradiol in various locations

1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:47.820
 and also increasing testosterone.

1:48:47.820 --> 1:48:49.740
 Interesting. Yeah, the dosage that I've been using

1:48:49.740 --> 1:48:52.940
 for years now is, I think it's 400 milligrams

1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:56.180
 taken once a day, typically early in the day,

1:48:56.180 --> 1:48:58.740
 cause it can kind of have a mild stimulant effect,

1:48:58.740 --> 1:48:59.580
 very mild.

1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:02.540
 And I know that some of the products out there

1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:04.380
 recommend dosages that are much higher.

1:49:04.380 --> 1:49:07.940
 Anytime I've taken more than 400, I don't feel very good.

1:49:07.940 --> 1:49:09.980
 I don't know how to describe it other than it's just

1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:12.420
 a little over stimulatory in terms of,

1:49:12.420 --> 1:49:15.320
 makes me kind of, it's like drinking too much coffee.

1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:18.460
 Yeah. So that's interesting.

1:49:18.460 --> 1:49:22.800
 And so would women ever want to take Tonga Ali

1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:23.680
 for any reason?

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:25.040
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:28.760
 So there's a lot of women that have hyper-estrogenism

1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:31.600
 and unlike adrenal fatigue or andropods,

1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:35.040
 there's actually ICD-10 codes for hyper-estrogenism.

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:36.160
 ICD-10 codes?

1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:37.520
 Yeah. That's doctor speak, right?

1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:40.080
 So there's codes to where your doctor

1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:41.480
 can actually diagnose you with something.

1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:43.080
 So if you go to your doctor and you say,

1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:44.020
 I have adrenal fatigue,

1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:45.840
 they can't diagnose you with that.

1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:47.240
 Or if you say, I have andropods,

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:49.240
 they also can't diagnose you with that.

1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:52.840
 But if you say you have hyper-estrogenism,

1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:55.000
 the most common complaint that comes with it

1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.720
 is endometriosis, which is overgrowth

1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:00.300
 of the lining of the uterus.

1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:03.320
 And those people could potentially,

1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:06.400
 I think that's one area where we might see

1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:09.520
 Tongkat supplementation more and more,

1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:11.920
 because not only does it decrease aromatase,

1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.120
 like we mentioned, testosterone in females is higher

1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:15.800
 than estrogen in females.

1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:19.580
 So a lot of females get estrogen from aromatization as well.

1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:21.920
 Peripheral estrogen is sometimes what we call it,

1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:25.000
 because it's not directly produced in the ovaries,

1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:26.760
 but they could be good candidates for Tongkat

1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:27.820
 if that's the case.

1:50:27.820 --> 1:50:28.660
 Very interesting.

1:50:28.660 --> 1:50:30.440
 And my understanding is that people should be looking

1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:33.480
 for sources of Indonesian Tongkat, Ali, in particular.

1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:34.300
 Correct.

1:50:34.300 --> 1:50:38.120
 Another interesting application is essentially a,

1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:41.080
 I'll call it a PCT, but essentially what that means is,

1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:44.440
 PCT means how defined it is, post-cycle therapy.

1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:46.480
 Physicians love acronyms, scientists love acronyms,

1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:49.620
 military love acronyms, but yeah, PCT, post-cycle therapy.

1:50:49.620 --> 1:50:51.640
 So this would be people coming off hormone therapy

1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:52.480
 or steroids.

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:54.780
 This would actually be for women that are coming off

1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:56.240
 of their birth control pill,

1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:59.200
 because perhaps it can help lower that SHBG back to normal,

1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:01.200
 which is sometimes persistently elevated,

1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:02.800
 and then it can help prevent

1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:05.840
 the subsequent hyper-estrogenism that happens.

1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:07.640
 Does Tongkat, Ali, need to be cycled?

1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:09.620
 When I first started taking it, I would cycle it.

1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:11.220
 I would do a few, three, four months,

1:51:11.220 --> 1:51:12.180
 and I would take some time off.

1:51:12.180 --> 1:51:14.960
 Now I've just been taking it continuously for years.

1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:18.100
 And I should say, I do blood work to check my liver enzymes

1:51:18.100 --> 1:51:18.940
 and everything else.

1:51:18.940 --> 1:51:23.680
 And I don't see any reason for me to cease taking it.

1:51:23.680 --> 1:51:25.820
 Yeah, probably not.

1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:28.640
 There's been human studies on both Tongkat and Fidosia.

1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:30.980
 And full disclosure, I did help design

1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:34.180
 Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement,

1:51:34.180 --> 1:51:36.440
 which has both Fidosia arrestris

1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:38.160
 and also Tongkat, Ali, in it.

1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:40.400
 Yeah, let's talk about Fidosia separately in a moment.

1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:44.680
 But let's say someone is only taking Tongkat, Ali

1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:48.280
 for whatever reason, but do they need to cycle off?

1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:51.000
 Likely not, but I would just to be safe

1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:54.100
 because it does both affect your aromatase

1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:57.860
 and it's an estrogen receptor modifier.

1:51:57.860 --> 1:52:00.980
 And what would be a reasonable cycle off?

1:52:00.980 --> 1:52:03.840
 So how long to take and how long to stop

1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:04.960
 before taking again?

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:07.840
 Yeah, there's a couple different protocols

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:10.420
 that you can do, but 11 months on,

1:52:10.420 --> 1:52:13.200
 one month off for Tongkat is pretty reasonable.

1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:15.880
 Now, I guess this is, we'll talk about this later too,

1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:17.980
 but if it's combined with Fidosia,

1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:21.280
 the protocol that I would do is three weeks on,

1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:23.080
 one week off.

1:52:23.080 --> 1:52:24.680
 So that's Tongkat, Ali.

1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:26.740
 But I'm curious what your thoughts are

1:52:26.740 --> 1:52:30.340
 on Fidosia aggressis, this Nigerian shrub,

1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:32.720
 or this extract from Nigerian shrubs,

1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:34.340
 that at least in my experience,

1:52:34.340 --> 1:52:35.680
 in my read of the literature,

1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:38.280
 has the potential to increase testosterone

1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:40.680
 and probably other hormones as well

1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:42.880
 by way of increasing luteinizing hormone,

1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:44.540
 something that we haven't really talked about

1:52:44.540 --> 1:52:45.880
 much up until now.

1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:48.360
 What are your thoughts about Fidosia aggressis?

1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:51.240
 What are your ideas about the proposed mechanism

1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:55.080
 or mechanisms and where might this be useful

1:52:55.080 --> 1:53:00.080
 for people on or off hormone replacement therapy?

1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:04.480
 Yeah, Fidosia aggressis has just reached a point

1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:06.640
 where we have enough evidence to we know

1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:10.360
 it probably helps both with luteinizing hormone release,

1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:12.360
 which stimulates latex cells in the testes

1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:14.160
 to produce more testosterone,

1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:18.940
 and probably with LH receptor sensitivity as well,

1:53:18.940 --> 1:53:20.880
 which is a good combination of the two.

1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:24.520
 It does come from the Nigerian shrub,

1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:27.880
 but there is not quite enough evidence

1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:30.660
 for me to be able to say,

1:53:30.660 --> 1:53:33.360
 it's safe for somebody to take this all the time,

1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:35.080
 which again, full disclosure,

1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:37.020
 that's why I recommended that we,

1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:41.700
 recommended for people to cycle this supplement.

1:53:41.700 --> 1:53:46.480
 So three weeks on, one week off, that's likely safe.

1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:49.640
 The only toxicity studies in general are in rats

1:53:49.640 --> 1:53:51.620
 and in humans, it looks quite safe.

1:53:51.620 --> 1:53:55.320
 My understanding is that the toxicity studies in rats

1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:59.800
 showed toxicity to the testicular cells.

1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.180
 So that's certainly concerning,

1:54:01.180 --> 1:54:04.160
 but that the dosages that were used

1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:07.500
 or translating the dosages used to humans

1:54:07.500 --> 1:54:09.900
 would lead to a situation where the dosages

1:54:09.900 --> 1:54:12.440
 that humans would have to take would be very, very large.

1:54:12.440 --> 1:54:15.780
 So the amount of, I no longer take Fidosia,

1:54:15.780 --> 1:54:19.080
 but I took it at 600 milligrams per day for a long time.

1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.320
 And I ceased taking it because I was experimenting

1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:25.480
 with other things and I didn't want to confound those things,

1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:27.800
 not because I had any negative side effects.

1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:29.360
 In fact, I was monitoring blood work

1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:31.920
 and other biological parameters

1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:35.040
 that would have told me if there was testicular toxicity

1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:36.860
 and there wasn't, let's put it that way.

1:54:36.860 --> 1:54:38.400
 Yeah, I think it's extremely safe.

1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:41.800
 And I'm just not convinced

1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:44.160
 that there's enough overwhelming evidence

1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:48.760
 for long-term consistent administration.

1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:53.360
 So do you recommend this to people who are not taking TRT?

1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:55.520
 And do you recommend to men and women?

1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:58.620
 Yeah, so if you have a really high LH,

1:54:58.620 --> 1:55:01.280
 then there's probably a gonadal issue,

1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:04.400
 whether it's heat damage to the testes, a varicocele,

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:06.720
 a history of testicular cancer,

1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:09.160
 where your LH is going to be higher.

1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:11.220
 So if your LH is already very high,

1:55:11.220 --> 1:55:14.000
 increasing it even more is probably not going to help.

1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.080
 However, if your LH is low,

1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:18.260
 then obviously try to find out if it is low.

1:55:18.260 --> 1:55:20.880
 Is it deficient or is it just a little bit low?

1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:23.320
 If it's low and you don't have an issue with prolactin,

1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:26.840
 you don't have an issue with opioid receptor antagonism,

1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:29.640
 then naltrexone can actually potentially help antagonize

1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:31.280
 that to increase LH as well,

1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:34.380
 especially in people recovering from opiates

1:55:34.380 --> 1:55:36.380
 or likely even alcohol.

1:55:36.380 --> 1:55:39.560
 So you're looking for a subclinical secondary hypogonadism,

1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:41.960
 which is essentially, just think of that as low LH.

1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:45.820
 So in people with that lower LH and their estrogen is fine

1:55:45.820 --> 1:55:48.120
 and their prolactin is fine,

1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:51.640
 then Fidogia is a particularly good option.

1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:54.520
 Interesting, so three weeks on, one week off

1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:59.400
 for 600 milligrams Fidogia, 400 milligrams Tonga Ali,

1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:03.240
 Indonesian Tonga Ali could potentially be good.

1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:04.400
 And of course, everyone should always check

1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:07.120
 with their physician, clear this, do blood work, et cetera.

1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:09.120
 I would say, we don't just say that to protect us.

1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.100
 We say that to protect you,

1:56:11.100 --> 1:56:15.460
 meaning that the consumer is very, very important.

1:56:15.460 --> 1:56:16.740
 You don't want to get,

1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:18.860
 you don't want to fly blind with any of this stuff.

1:56:18.860 --> 1:56:20.320
 You want to do blood work, right?

1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:21.960
 That's the catch-22 with supplements,

1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:24.160
 is most of them are safer than medications,

1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:26.520
 but the only difference between them and a medication

1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:28.680
 is one's prescribed and one's not.

1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:30.100
 And oftentimes with supplements,

1:56:30.100 --> 1:56:32.400
 it's unclear whether or not what's listed on the bottle

1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:33.680
 is actually what's in the bottle,

1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:37.140
 but I think there are a number of reputable brands now.

1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:41.360
 The other supplement I want to talk about

1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:44.620
 in terms of testosterone augmentation is Boron.

1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:46.560
 What is Boron thought to do?

1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:47.920
 Does it actually do that?

1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:50.400
 And do you ever recommend Boron?

1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:53.320
 Yeah, so Boron is actually an element

1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:55.880
 and you can find it on the periodic table.

1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:59.120
 It's more plentiful in rich soils.

1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:03.120
 So frequent farming can deplete the soils of Boron.

1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:04.960
 It's very plentiful in the Mediterranean area,

1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:06.440
 like Greece and Turkey.

1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:09.420
 So a lot of people will just eat dates or raisins

1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:10.260
 that are grown there.

1:57:10.260 --> 1:57:11.440
 I thought you were going to tell me people eat dirt,

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:13.280
 but there are people who eat dirt.

1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:15.880
 And there's a phenomenon called pica, right?

1:57:15.880 --> 1:57:19.240
 Where people in a, and that's not a good thing.

1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:21.100
 Often a sign of iron deficiency.

1:57:21.100 --> 1:57:23.320
 Okay, but they're eating grapes and dates

1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:26.120
 that were grown in soil that has high amounts of Boron?

1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:26.960
 Is that right?

1:57:26.960 --> 1:57:27.780
 Yeah, yeah.

1:57:27.780 --> 1:57:30.280
 So Boron can help regulate SHBG,

1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:32.680
 but its effect is mostly acute.

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:36.040
 So it's unlikely to have a bad effect.

1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:37.320
 So a lot of people take Boron

1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:39.520
 because it's probably not going to hurt

1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:42.120
 and it will lower SHBG,

1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:45.400
 even if it is for a short period of time.

1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:46.440
 So I guess you can make a case

1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:48.800
 that maybe cycling Boron can help too.

1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:52.880
 What sorts of dosages are useful for Boron supplementation?

1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:55.160
 Three to six milligrams, once to twice a day.

1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:55.980
 Oh, interesting.

1:57:55.980 --> 1:57:58.600
 So that's higher than the amounts that I've been taking.

1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:02.040
 I've long been doing this cocktail of Tonga Ali.

1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:03.560
 Again, I stopped taking Fidogia,

1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:07.120
 but for a long time with Fidogia and Boron,

1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:08.880
 I think it was two to four milligrams per day,

1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:10.440
 but maybe I could afford to go higher.

1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:13.500
 Although my blood work is where I want it, thankfully.

1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:15.920
 Sort of circling back to Fidogia,

1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:19.140
 Fidogia was attractive to me as a supplement

1:58:19.140 --> 1:58:21.440
 because I saw increases in LH,

1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:23.520
 testosterone and free testosterone.

1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:25.360
 My estrogen stayed in check,

1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:29.600
 but I also did not see a down regulation of LH

1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:31.640
 when I would cycle off.

1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:35.600
 Whereas with HCG, human cortionic gonadotropin,

1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:39.880
 which does now arrive in forms

1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:41.760
 not from pregnant women's urine only,

1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:43.960
 but the synthetic forms that people inject,

1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:47.880
 that as I understand it can actually suppress hormone,

1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:49.120
 endogenous hormone output

1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:50.580
 if one takes it for a long period of time.

1:58:50.580 --> 1:58:54.080
 So why would a man or woman want to take HCG

1:58:54.080 --> 1:58:58.280
 and what are the potential risks and benefits of taking HCG?

1:58:58.280 --> 1:59:01.800
 Yeah, so HCG or human cortionic gonadotropin

1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:04.640
 is actually very similar to TSH.

1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:06.120
 So if you- Thyroid stimulating hormone.

1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:07.080
 Correct.

1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:11.960
 So when a woman is pregnant, she produces more HCG,

1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:14.120
 especially in the first trimester.

1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:15.440
 When you take a pregnancy test,

1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:17.860
 whether it's qualitative or quantitative,

1:59:17.860 --> 1:59:22.720
 you see the HCG rise and it actually doubles every 48 hours.

1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:26.240
 So if you're five weeks pregnant, you can get an HCG level.

1:59:26.240 --> 1:59:29.040
 And then two days later, five weeks and two days,

1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:33.220
 you can see your HCG and maybe it went from 500 to 1,000.

1:59:33.220 --> 1:59:36.020
 So it precipitously increases.

1:59:37.420 --> 1:59:39.060
 It does a few things.

1:59:39.060 --> 1:59:42.040
 One thing is it prevents hypothyroidism

1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:44.820
 or hypothyroxinemia of pregnancy,

1:59:44.820 --> 1:59:48.260
 which is one of the most common causes of miscarriage.

1:59:48.260 --> 1:59:52.740
 It's also why if you have hypothyroidism

1:59:52.740 --> 1:59:54.920
 and you get pregnant in the first trimester,

1:59:54.920 --> 1:59:58.840
 you want to increase your dose from 25 to 40%

1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:02.200
 to keep your free T4 high as much as possible.

2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:04.060
 And the reason why you have to do that

2:00:04.060 --> 2:00:07.360
 as opposed to somebody who does not have hypothyroidism

2:00:07.360 --> 2:00:08.860
 is if you have hypothyroidism,

2:00:08.860 --> 2:00:11.760
 then likely your thyroid will not respond

2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:15.480
 to either TSH or HCG.

2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:18.800
 So the increased HCG does not compensate for that.

2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:20.840
 So if you take HCG,

2:00:20.840 --> 2:00:23.600
 then it can potentially improve your thyroid function.

2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:26.960
 So that along with selenium are likely the two best things

2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:28.520
 that you can do for thyroid health.

2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:30.240
 HCG and selenium?

2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:33.060
 Well, I definitely make sure I get enough selenium

2:00:33.060 --> 2:00:37.000
 by eating three to five Brazil nuts per day,

2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.200
 which I very much enjoy the taste of also.

2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:44.460
 Who should take HCG and can HCG suppress

2:00:44.460 --> 2:00:47.040
 one's normal luteinizing hormone output?

2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:51.080
 Yeah, it suppresses LH in a dose dependent manner.

2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:53.960
 So the higher the dose of HCG you take,

2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:55.560
 the more it suppresses LH.

2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:57.520
 A common dose for fertility,

2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:00.120
 fertility is usually why HCG is prescribed.

2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:01.080
 In men or women?

2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:06.080
 In both, is 10,000 IUs all at one time,

2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:07.600
 which is quite a bit.

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:10.080
 That's a tremendous dose.

2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:11.920
 Yeah, in fact, some formulations,

2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:15.840
 some brand names of HCG come in auto injector pins

2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:17.320
 to where you cannot even dose

2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:19.640
 lower than 5,000 units at a time.

2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:21.720
 Wow, but I know a number of people

2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:24.220
 who take HCG to maintain testicular function

2:01:24.220 --> 2:01:28.360
 while on testosterone therapy or augmentation of some sort.

2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:30.600
 Does it work to do that?

2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:34.460
 Yeah, some people are on HCG model therapy.

2:01:34.460 --> 2:01:39.460
 It can be slightly better on your lipids than being on TRT.

2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:42.440
 Oh, so people are using HCG alone

2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:46.280
 as a kind of a sort of a hormone augment,

2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:48.240
 indirect hormone augmentation.

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:49.640
 Some clinics advertise it

2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:54.640
 as a non-suppressive alternative to TRT,

2:01:54.720 --> 2:01:56.460
 but it is suppressive of LH.

2:01:56.460 --> 2:01:58.900
 But it could also increase estrogen pretty potently.

2:01:58.900 --> 2:01:59.740
 Yeah.

2:01:59.740 --> 2:02:01.760
 And is it true that increasing LH

2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:06.760
 and or HCG can improve sensitivity of the genitals?

2:02:08.340 --> 2:02:09.900
 And is that true for men and women?

2:02:09.900 --> 2:02:11.060
 I've heard this anecdotally.

2:02:11.060 --> 2:02:14.200
 People say HCG makes sexual activity

2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:17.060
 more pleasurable for people because of some,

2:02:17.060 --> 2:02:20.300
 is it a direct effect on some of the nerve cells

2:02:20.300 --> 2:02:21.860
 in the genitals?

2:02:21.860 --> 2:02:26.380
 Yeah, so LH is also an agonist in the prostate

2:02:26.380 --> 2:02:29.140
 and in genital tissue in general.

2:02:29.140 --> 2:02:32.380
 So it's a very common treatment

2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:36.220
 for post finasteride syndrome or post 5-alpha reductase.

2:02:36.220 --> 2:02:39.660
 When you've blocked the conversion of DHT for a long time,

2:02:39.660 --> 2:02:42.580
 it helps re-upregulate DHT.

2:02:42.580 --> 2:02:44.420
 So someone who's been taking finasteride

2:02:44.420 --> 2:02:46.440
 to prevent hair loss comes off,

2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:49.120
 it feels maybe because they felt lousy,

2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:50.540
 but then feels even lousier

2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.060
 for reasons that you talked about earlier.

2:02:52.060 --> 2:02:55.560
 And then they might use HCG as a transition treatment

2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:58.980
 to transition back to normal hormone health.

2:02:58.980 --> 2:02:59.820
 Is that right?

2:02:59.820 --> 2:03:02.240
 It's extremely helpful in many cases.

2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:03.580
 Now, when you come off the HCG,

2:03:03.580 --> 2:03:04.660
 then you need to have a strategy

2:03:04.660 --> 2:03:06.700
 of how to return to your normal

2:03:06.700 --> 2:03:08.600
 as fast as possible as well,

2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:11.540
 but it will upregulate those 5-alpha reductase enzymes.

2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:13.120
 You have in your genital skin,

2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:17.180
 both scretal skin and penile skin and perineum in general,

2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:20.260
 you have, I believe it's called stratum lucidum.

2:03:20.260 --> 2:03:24.020
 It's a skin layer that is very, very thin,

2:03:24.020 --> 2:03:28.420
 but it has the highest concentration of 5-alpha reductase.

2:03:28.420 --> 2:03:30.820
 So you have a lot of activity

2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:32.700
 and after you've been on something

2:03:32.700 --> 2:03:37.700
 that inhibits the enzyme, the 5-AR enzyme in those tissues,

2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:41.460
 then you do something else to upregulate those enzymes.

2:03:41.460 --> 2:03:43.620
 Whether it's waiting and taking time,

2:03:43.620 --> 2:03:45.420
 whether it's trying Tidalafil,

2:03:45.420 --> 2:03:47.940
 whether it's trying creatine even,

2:03:47.940 --> 2:03:50.300
 or whether it's trying HCG,

2:03:50.300 --> 2:03:51.700
 a lot of times those are the go-tos

2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:53.420
 for post-finasteride syndrome.

2:03:53.420 --> 2:03:56.060
 Any risks for women taking HCG

2:03:56.060 --> 2:04:01.060
 on their ability to get pregnant or risk generally?

2:04:02.180 --> 2:04:05.240
 Yeah, obviously it'll make any pregnancy test positive.

2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:07.720
 So that's a risk that some women don't know.

2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:09.880
 So one could in theory fake a pregnancy test

2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:10.980
 by injecting HCG?

2:04:10.980 --> 2:04:11.860
 Absolutely.

2:04:11.860 --> 2:04:13.500
 Interesting.

2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:15.660
 I have no motivation to do that.

2:04:15.660 --> 2:04:16.680
 I was just curious.

2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:21.420
 What about prolactin?

2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:24.660
 The simple version of this that I was taught,

2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:26.020
 because I was taught mainly

2:04:26.020 --> 2:04:27.660
 from the neuroendocrine perspective,

2:04:27.660 --> 2:04:31.140
 was dopamine is a kind of close cousin of testosterone

2:04:31.140 --> 2:04:33.420
 and also estrogen, for that matter,

2:04:33.420 --> 2:04:34.800
 drives repetitive behaviors,

2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:38.400
 including pursuit of sexual partners, sex itself,

2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:40.180
 motivated behaviors generally.

2:04:40.180 --> 2:04:45.020
 Then post-copulatory, post-orgasmic states

2:04:45.020 --> 2:04:46.940
 are accompanied by a prolactin increase,

2:04:46.940 --> 2:04:48.900
 sets the refractory period for mating in males

2:04:48.900 --> 2:04:51.520
 and maybe even in females as well,

2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:53.980
 involved in milk letdown, et cetera.

2:04:53.980 --> 2:04:57.260
 What are sort of the general contours of syndromes

2:04:57.260 --> 2:04:59.380
 or things that people could be on the lookout for

2:04:59.380 --> 2:05:03.260
 of having too much prolactin or too little prolactin?

2:05:03.260 --> 2:05:05.460
 And I'm aware of a number of people

2:05:05.460 --> 2:05:10.120
 who take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline,

2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:13.020
 things like that, to really boost their dopamine levels.

2:05:13.020 --> 2:05:15.540
 And that isn't always a good thing, as it turns out.

2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:18.220
 Oftentimes people will become kind of hyper dopaminergic.

2:05:18.220 --> 2:05:21.220
 And so they have the drive to do all these repetitive things,

2:05:21.220 --> 2:05:23.020
 you know, fill in the blanks,

2:05:23.020 --> 2:05:25.260
 but they don't always have the ability

2:05:25.260 --> 2:05:27.660
 because it seems just as testosterone and estrogen

2:05:27.660 --> 2:05:29.240
 need to be in the proper ratios,

2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:30.680
 dopamine and prolactin need to be

2:05:30.680 --> 2:05:32.340
 in the appropriate ratios.

2:05:32.340 --> 2:05:34.540
 So how should we think about

2:05:34.540 --> 2:05:37.520
 and perhaps act on our prolactin systems?

2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:38.740
 Absolutely.

2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:41.500
 The way I describe it is the dopamine wave pool.

2:05:41.500 --> 2:05:44.180
 So if you're increasing your dopamine too much,

2:05:44.180 --> 2:05:45.660
 you're going to overflow,

2:05:45.660 --> 2:05:47.960
 and then you're going to have that wave crash too much.

2:05:47.960 --> 2:05:50.100
 So you want to have nice, even waves

2:05:50.100 --> 2:05:53.180
 that are not going too far above the pool of dopamine

2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:55.040
 and prolactin will follow.

2:05:55.040 --> 2:05:58.180
 So prolactin and estrogen are quite close cousins.

2:05:58.180 --> 2:06:01.540
 Estrogen upregulates a gene called the PRL gene

2:06:01.540 --> 2:06:03.100
 or prolactin gene

2:06:03.100 --> 2:06:06.860
 that directly increases prolactin synthesis.

2:06:06.860 --> 2:06:11.280
 So prolactin is going to also inhibit

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:14.880
 the release of testosterone from the pituitary.

2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:17.500
 So if you're using a dopamine agonist,

2:06:17.500 --> 2:06:20.300
 then you're going to help decrease

2:06:20.300 --> 2:06:22.180
 the prolactin producing cells,

2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:23.980
 including if you have a prolactin producing

2:06:23.980 --> 2:06:26.180
 micro adenoma in the pituitary.

2:06:26.180 --> 2:06:27.100
 How common are those?

2:06:27.100 --> 2:06:28.960
 Because I mean, I hear a lot about these,

2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:31.300
 you know, hypogonadism or,

2:06:31.300 --> 2:06:34.320
 and of course that can be due to an issue at the testicles

2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:37.940
 or hypogonadism could also be of course

2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:40.540
 in like ovarian syndromes.

2:06:40.540 --> 2:06:42.180
 And then there's of course the brain side of it,

2:06:42.180 --> 2:06:43.700
 where the signals aren't coming from the brain.

2:06:43.700 --> 2:06:45.740
 You're not enough gonadotropin,

2:06:45.740 --> 2:06:47.140
 not enough luteinizing hormone.

2:06:47.140 --> 2:06:48.700
 And there are ways of teasing this apart

2:06:48.700 --> 2:06:49.980
 through with an endocrinologist

2:06:49.980 --> 2:06:51.380
 that are quite elegant in fact, right?

2:06:51.380 --> 2:06:54.020
 Using stimulating hormones, too much to dive into here,

2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:57.040
 but how often does one actually have

2:06:57.040 --> 2:06:59.220
 one of these pituitary tumors?

2:06:59.220 --> 2:07:01.780
 I have heard that people

2:07:01.780 --> 2:07:03.540
 that play a lot of high contact sports,

2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:05.700
 so boxing, football,

2:07:05.700 --> 2:07:08.220
 people that headed the soccer ball quite a lot,

2:07:09.460 --> 2:07:13.500
 sadly people whose jobs forced them to take head blows

2:07:13.500 --> 2:07:15.260
 for, you know, it could be military.

2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:17.500
 And so they were firing, you know, 50 caliber guns

2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:19.200
 and the kind of woodpeckering of the brain

2:07:19.200 --> 2:07:22.740
 inside of the skull and construction workers,

2:07:22.740 --> 2:07:25.660
 or just a concussion can cause the pituitary

2:07:25.660 --> 2:07:27.220
 to go malfunctional.

2:07:27.220 --> 2:07:30.340
 Is that really common or is this something that,

2:07:30.340 --> 2:07:33.340
 you know, is a rare, like 1%?

2:07:33.340 --> 2:07:34.940
 Yeah, it's extremely common.

2:07:34.940 --> 2:07:36.260
 It's another one of those conditions

2:07:36.260 --> 2:07:39.020
 where a lot of people never know they have it.

2:07:39.020 --> 2:07:40.940
 They just feel a little bit more fatigued.

2:07:40.940 --> 2:07:44.660
 They have that high prolactin feeling all the time.

2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:47.880
 Pituitary micro adenomas can be non-producing as well.

2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:49.960
 So your prolactin can be totally normal.

2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:52.180
 Your growth hormone and IGF-1 can be totally normal.

2:07:52.180 --> 2:07:54.820
 That's the second most common producing micro adenoma

2:07:54.820 --> 2:07:56.020
 is growth hormone,

2:07:56.020 --> 2:07:57.460
 causing either acromegaly,

2:07:57.460 --> 2:07:59.840
 which is growth of cartilage or gigantism.

2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:02.900
 This is the big brow, yeah.

2:08:02.900 --> 2:08:05.740
 So those are fairly common causes of adenomas,

2:08:05.740 --> 2:08:09.600
 but a lot of people that have a very small adenoma,

2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:11.980
 you know, much less than one centimeter,

2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:13.500
 it's hard to see on imaging,

2:08:13.500 --> 2:08:15.900
 even if you have a contrast

2:08:15.900 --> 2:08:18.300
 that specifically looks at the pituitary,

2:08:18.300 --> 2:08:20.720
 and many people aren't symptomatic.

2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:25.720
 So it's one of those things along with PCOS and prediabetes

2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:29.940
 that are much more frequent when it comes to prevalence,

2:08:29.940 --> 2:08:32.700
 which is the amount, the percentage of people

2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:35.140
 that have it in the general population.

2:08:35.140 --> 2:08:37.020
 I'm glad you mentioned the dopamine wave pool.

2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:39.240
 I know nowadays there's a lot of interest

2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:40.720
 in augmenting dopamine.

2:08:41.660 --> 2:08:42.880
 I know a number of people that do this

2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:46.140
 through prescription drugs, Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil,

2:08:46.140 --> 2:08:48.300
 and those drugs, of course, hit many transmitter systems,

2:08:48.300 --> 2:08:49.820
 but dopamine is certainly involved.

2:08:49.820 --> 2:08:53.020
 People taking antidepressants like wellbutrin

2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:55.000
 tap into that system.

2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:58.420
 And of course, people are trying to inhibit prolactin

2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:01.140
 and promote serotonin or reduce serotonin.

2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:04.460
 To me, it all seems like a very delicate dance, right?

2:09:04.460 --> 2:09:07.560
 I mean, to just imagine the arousal arc

2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:10.600
 for mating behavior, for sexual reproduction,

2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:13.980
 is such an elaborate dance between sympathetic drive

2:09:13.980 --> 2:09:15.100
 and parasympathetic drive,

2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:17.660
 even with across the span of minutes, right?

2:09:17.660 --> 2:09:19.340
 I mean, I've talked about this before on the podcast

2:09:19.340 --> 2:09:23.120
 that the arousal is kind of more parasympathetic.

2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:26.260
 Orgasm in itself is a sympathetic response,

2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:28.100
 a completely different set of neurons.

2:09:28.100 --> 2:09:31.540
 And so where do you see people getting into trouble

2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:34.620
 just trying to hit the gas pedal on dopamine?

2:09:34.620 --> 2:09:37.060
 And where do you think there is a place for people

2:09:37.060 --> 2:09:39.840
 who perhaps are experiencing low drive and motivation,

2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:42.360
 not just sexual, but in general,

2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.780
 to increase the amount of dopamine circulating

2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:45.940
 in their brain and body?

2:09:45.940 --> 2:09:49.420
 How do you think about that given this wave pool analogy?

2:09:49.420 --> 2:09:51.420
 Yeah, so it's important to parse it out

2:09:51.420 --> 2:09:55.220
 and start with the least powerful interventions.

2:09:55.220 --> 2:09:57.340
 So if someone's concerned about dopamine,

2:09:57.340 --> 2:09:59.960
 or maybe they have a slightly higher prolactin,

2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:01.000
 then they eliminate things

2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.540
 that could be increasing that prolactin.

2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:06.620
 So casein or gluten,

2:10:06.620 --> 2:10:09.360
 which are mu opioid receptor agonists,

2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:12.460
 or any mu opioid receptor agonist in the gut.

2:10:12.460 --> 2:10:14.360
 So casein, so milk protein?

2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:15.200
 Correct.

2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:16.100
 Can increase prolactin?

2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:17.180
 Correct.

2:10:17.180 --> 2:10:18.020
 Interesting.

2:10:18.020 --> 2:10:20.820
 In addition to that, they should,

2:10:20.820 --> 2:10:22.220
 if they need a pituitary MRI,

2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:23.820
 then they should get a pituitary MRI.

2:10:23.820 --> 2:10:25.180
 If they don't have an adenoma,

2:10:25.180 --> 2:10:27.480
 or if they don't have a high enough prolactin level

2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:29.620
 to where they need an MRI,

2:10:29.620 --> 2:10:31.060
 if they're having visual symptoms,

2:10:31.060 --> 2:10:33.920
 or if they're having olfactory symptoms with the nose,

2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:36.800
 then it's more likely that they do.

2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:38.420
 But if they don't,

2:10:38.420 --> 2:10:40.900
 a lot of times a prolactin under about 40

2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:42.740
 is not too big of a deal.

2:10:42.740 --> 2:10:44.780
 They can take dopamine agonists

2:10:44.780 --> 2:10:46.700
 that agonize that D2 receptor,

2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:51.020
 like P5P, which is essentially vitamin B6.

2:10:51.020 --> 2:10:53.380
 It's pyridoxine 5-pyrophosphate,

2:10:53.380 --> 2:10:55.720
 and pyridoxine is vitamin B6.

2:10:55.720 --> 2:10:59.500
 So that can help 50 milligrams once to twice a day.

2:10:59.500 --> 2:11:01.460
 Vitamin E can also help,

2:11:01.460 --> 2:11:03.660
 especially if it's mixed to co-forals.

2:11:03.660 --> 2:11:07.540
 A lot of people have the high levels of vitamin E,

2:11:07.540 --> 2:11:11.060
 but low levels of the gamma form of vitamin E.

2:11:11.060 --> 2:11:12.320
 So that can also help.

2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:13.160
 Fascinating.

2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:16.020
 I'm so glad you mentioned vitamin B6 and P5P.

2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:21.580
 I have heard that one can shorten the refractory period

2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:24.260
 after orgasm,

2:11:24.260 --> 2:11:26.640
 essentially to be able to have sex again,

2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:27.980
 to be quite direct about it,

2:11:27.980 --> 2:11:32.880
 by way of vitamin B6 blunting of the prolactin response,

2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:35.420
 which turns out to be quite potent.

2:11:35.420 --> 2:11:38.340
 But I've also heard that vitamin B6 can be neurotoxic,

2:11:38.340 --> 2:11:39.580
 especially in the periphery,

2:11:39.580 --> 2:11:41.160
 that it can cause peripheral neuropathies

2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:42.760
 if it's taken at high doses,

2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:45.580
 but that P5P is the safer form.

2:11:45.580 --> 2:11:46.980
 Is that true?

2:11:46.980 --> 2:11:50.960
 It's pre-activated, so it does not build up.

2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:55.300
 Think of it as a allegory to how folate can build up.

2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:57.940
 It's not methyl folate,

2:11:57.940 --> 2:12:01.700
 but it builds up and it can increase levels of homocysteine.

2:12:01.700 --> 2:12:03.580
 Or if you have too much vitamin B12,

2:12:03.580 --> 2:12:05.620
 another water-soluble B vitamin,

2:12:05.620 --> 2:12:08.820
 you can have too much methylmalonic acid or MMA.

2:12:08.820 --> 2:12:11.520
 So depending on what your enzymatic conversion is

2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:13.460
 to the active form of the enzyme,

2:12:13.460 --> 2:12:17.020
 often it's just safer to take the active form of the enzyme.

2:12:17.020 --> 2:12:18.260
 Yeah, very interesting.

2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:22.180
 Okay, well, at risk of going down every hormonal pathway

2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:24.820
 and talking about supplementation lifestyle factors,

2:12:24.820 --> 2:12:25.980
 I think touching on,

2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:29.300
 as we have testosterone and estrogen and now prolactin,

2:12:29.300 --> 2:12:32.140
 I'd love to chat a little bit about L-carnitine.

2:12:32.140 --> 2:12:33.260
 We talked about this earlier,

2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:37.020
 but I want to raise this discussion about L-carnitine,

2:12:37.020 --> 2:12:39.300
 not in the context of L-carnitine itself,

2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:42.020
 but in the context of fertility,

2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:45.260
 because my read of the literature is that L-carnitine

2:12:45.260 --> 2:12:48.620
 can be very beneficial for enhancing sperm quality

2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:51.660
 and egg quality and even rates of conception.

2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:55.180
 What forms does L-carnitine come in

2:12:55.180 --> 2:12:57.860
 that people can reasonably consider?

2:12:57.860 --> 2:13:00.540
 Again, talk to your doctor, folks.

2:13:00.540 --> 2:13:03.580
 What is it doing and do we know how it's doing it?

2:13:03.580 --> 2:13:07.220
 And do you often use this in your patients?

2:13:07.220 --> 2:13:10.340
 Yeah, so the way I think about L-carnitine,

2:13:10.340 --> 2:13:12.380
 and I'll try to tie this in with creatine

2:13:12.380 --> 2:13:14.000
 and other things as well,

2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.400
 is if your cell is an energy factory or a car,

2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:22.400
 then L-carnitine is the shuttle that helps get the fuel

2:13:22.460 --> 2:13:24.260
 into the motor to use the motor.

2:13:24.260 --> 2:13:27.240
 The motor is mostly due to lifestyle factors,

2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:30.600
 so like your diet and your exercise.

2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.620
 And the type of fuel itself is NAD+.

2:13:34.620 --> 2:13:36.320
 We don't need to get into NAD precursors

2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:38.480
 or NMN or NR or anything.

2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:42.020
 And then the accessory fuel tank is your creatine phosphate.

2:13:42.020 --> 2:13:44.540
 So creatine is your accessory fuel tank.

2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:47.100
 Your NAD status, which is largely determined

2:13:47.100 --> 2:13:49.980
 by your REM sleep and quality sleep and exercise,

2:13:49.980 --> 2:13:52.320
 along with supplementation, is the fuel.

2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:57.320
 The carnitine shuttle is carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A,

2:13:57.580 --> 2:13:59.760
 and that takes medium-chain fatty acids.

2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:01.860
 It takes different molecules of fat.

2:14:01.860 --> 2:14:04.500
 You have two main energy sources other than ketones.

2:14:04.500 --> 2:14:06.120
 You have your glucose or carbs.

2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:08.340
 You have your fat or fatty acids.

2:14:08.340 --> 2:14:12.380
 And that takes it across the layer of the mitochondria

2:14:12.380 --> 2:14:13.940
 so that it can be utilized.

2:14:13.940 --> 2:14:15.700
 So it upregulates that.

2:14:15.700 --> 2:14:18.860
 That's why things that have flagella in general,

2:14:18.860 --> 2:14:21.220
 the flagella are gonna work better, like sperm.

2:14:21.220 --> 2:14:24.060
 Flagella being sort of the wavy little tendrils

2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:26.100
 on cell types, of which they're everywhere, right?

2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:27.260
 In the gut too, right?

2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:28.100
 Yeah.

2:14:28.100 --> 2:14:30.240
 So those are going to work significantly better.

2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:32.860
 And in general, your mitochondria are going to work better.

2:14:32.860 --> 2:14:35.440
 So the worse your mitochondria are off the bat,

2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:38.500
 the better they're going to be helped by the shuttle

2:14:38.500 --> 2:14:40.320
 that shuttles them across.

2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:42.700
 It also slightly increases the density

2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:44.980
 of the androgen receptor as well.

2:14:44.980 --> 2:14:46.020
 Is that a local effect?

2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:48.540
 So if alkaline is injected into a particular muscle,

2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:50.340
 will it increase the density of androgen receptors

2:14:50.340 --> 2:14:51.480
 in that muscle?

2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:52.500
 Likely so.

2:14:52.500 --> 2:14:54.140
 So how are people taking L-carnitine,

2:14:54.140 --> 2:14:56.580
 their capsule forms and their injectable forms?

2:14:56.580 --> 2:14:59.020
 Most people are going to be taking the capsule forms

2:14:59.020 --> 2:15:00.980
 because that's all they're going to have access to.

2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:02.020
 And then we should also ask,

2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:04.020
 can you get L-carnitine from food?

2:15:04.020 --> 2:15:04.860
 Yeah.

2:15:04.860 --> 2:15:08.580
 So L-carnitine is just a combination of,

2:15:08.580 --> 2:15:10.380
 it's actually a very small peptide.

2:15:10.380 --> 2:15:13.940
 So glutathione is just three amino acids.

2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:16.820
 L-carnitine is the smallest peptide, two.

2:15:16.820 --> 2:15:19.460
 So peptide is just a protein that has amino acids

2:15:19.460 --> 2:15:21.660
 between two and about 200.

2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:24.580
 And L-carnitine is just two amino acids.

2:15:24.580 --> 2:15:25.420
 Amazing.

2:15:25.420 --> 2:15:27.260
 So it's like a micro peptide.

2:15:27.260 --> 2:15:29.500
 Yeah, so your body synthesizes enough.

2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:32.140
 It likes to absorb the amino acids by themselves.

2:15:32.140 --> 2:15:34.140
 And then if it puts them together,

2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:35.840
 there it makes L-carnitine.

2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:38.540
 It's not very bioavailable if you take it.

2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:40.660
 A lot of people will take L-carnitine L-tartrate

2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:45.260
 or acyl L-carnitine, and that's about 10% bioavailable.

2:15:45.260 --> 2:15:48.060
 So if you want one gram or a thousand milligrams

2:15:48.060 --> 2:15:51.660
 of L-carnitine, you can take 10 grams of oral L-carnitine.

2:15:51.660 --> 2:15:54.580
 Is the one gram, the typical dose you recommend,

2:15:54.580 --> 2:15:56.020
 one gram per day?

2:15:56.020 --> 2:15:58.700
 For fertility and androgen receptor upregulation.

2:15:58.700 --> 2:16:01.500
 So that means taking 10 grams of the capsule form.

2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:05.780
 Yeah, so it's about 15 to 20 capsules, which is a lot.

2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:06.620
 That is a lot.

2:16:06.620 --> 2:16:08.500
 It can also potentially increase TMAO.

2:16:08.500 --> 2:16:11.620
 Yeah, I wanted to ask about that because TMAO

2:16:11.620 --> 2:16:14.380
 on your blood chart is, when that's elevated,

2:16:14.380 --> 2:16:16.300
 that's going to cause some concern.

2:16:16.300 --> 2:16:19.140
 You taught me a trick, however, that one can take

2:16:19.140 --> 2:16:23.980
 600 milligrams of garlic capsule for the allicin.

2:16:23.980 --> 2:16:24.820
 Is that what it's called?

2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:25.660
 Allicin is in it, yeah.

2:16:25.660 --> 2:16:27.300
 It's like the name allicin, but with two Ls?

2:16:27.300 --> 2:16:28.140
 Yeah.

2:16:28.140 --> 2:16:29.100
 Okay.

2:16:29.100 --> 2:16:33.360
 And that had a remarkable effect in reducing TMAO.

2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:34.700
 So that's quite potent.

2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:38.440
 And also, was it just coincidence

2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:41.940
 that it really brought my LDL down as well?

2:16:42.940 --> 2:16:45.220
 I'm not sure if the LDL is a coincidence,

2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:49.040
 but depending on your gut microbiome or your microbiota,

2:16:49.900 --> 2:16:54.180
 some microbiome beneficial bacteria

2:16:54.180 --> 2:16:57.620
 will convert carnitine and also choline.

2:16:57.620 --> 2:16:59.980
 So any choline precursor like alpha GPC

2:16:59.980 --> 2:17:02.300
 or phosphatidylserine, it will convert them

2:17:02.300 --> 2:17:04.460
 more or less to TMAO.

2:17:04.460 --> 2:17:06.220
 So TMAO is something that you can get measured

2:17:06.220 --> 2:17:08.580
 in a blood test and see if it's high or low.

2:17:08.580 --> 2:17:11.060
 Some people might not even need allicin.

2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:11.900
 Interesting.

2:17:11.900 --> 2:17:12.800
 Some people do benefit from it.

2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:13.640
 Interesting.

2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:16.500
 So I think it was you that also told me

2:17:16.500 --> 2:17:19.220
 that allicin and garlic can have positive effects

2:17:19.220 --> 2:17:22.420
 on cardiovascular tone and blood flow generally.

2:17:22.420 --> 2:17:23.240
 Is that right?

2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:24.080
 Yeah.

2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:26.500
 Okay, so maybe, so it's 600 milligrams garlic

2:17:26.500 --> 2:17:29.620
 in excessive amount, or can I just eat garlic?

2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:30.460
 You can just eat garlic.

2:17:30.460 --> 2:17:31.300
 I mean, I like eating garlic.

2:17:31.300 --> 2:17:32.140
 Yeah.

2:17:32.140 --> 2:17:34.620
 Yeah, so, okay, so one could also just eat garlic.

2:17:34.620 --> 2:17:37.620
 If one were going to take L-carnitine in injectable form,

2:17:37.620 --> 2:17:39.860
 how much of that is bioavailable?

2:17:39.860 --> 2:17:41.940
 100% if you inject it.

2:17:41.940 --> 2:17:44.020
 It is in an aqueous solution.

2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:47.020
 So it's a bacteriostatic water essentially.

2:17:47.020 --> 2:17:49.360
 So it's not in a carrier oil.

2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:51.340
 So it really, it's going to burn a lot

2:17:51.340 --> 2:17:53.420
 if you inject it subcutaneously.

2:17:53.420 --> 2:17:57.420
 So it's going to be absorbed faster and more evenly

2:17:57.420 --> 2:17:59.320
 and also just hurt a lot less

2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:01.320
 if you inject it into a muscle.

2:18:01.320 --> 2:18:05.380
 But one could then just take one gram per day injected

2:18:05.380 --> 2:18:07.020
 or divide it up into a couple of doses.

2:18:07.020 --> 2:18:07.940
 Yeah, or 500.

2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:10.660
 The minimally efficacious dose for injectables

2:18:10.660 --> 2:18:14.660
 is probably around 200 when it comes to sperm motility

2:18:14.660 --> 2:18:16.900
 and androgen receptor upregulation.

2:18:16.900 --> 2:18:19.540
 So it really depends on why you're taking it.

2:18:19.540 --> 2:18:22.540
 In terms of fertility and in terms of blood tests generally,

2:18:23.500 --> 2:18:28.020
 you know, I always say that if possible,

2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:32.220
 either by way of insurance or by way of some other way

2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:34.540
 affording it, it would be great for people

2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:37.320
 to have blood tests to know what their hormone levels

2:18:37.320 --> 2:18:39.780
 and other levels of other things like metabolic markers

2:18:39.780 --> 2:18:42.100
 and lipids were in their 20s,

2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:43.780
 also in their 30s, also in their 40s.

2:18:43.780 --> 2:18:46.180
 I think there's this idea that you only take a blood test

2:18:46.180 --> 2:18:47.380
 when you have a problem,

2:18:47.380 --> 2:18:51.660
 but then of course one can't actually do the comparison

2:18:51.660 --> 2:18:53.660
 that you mentioned earlier or state the comparison

2:18:53.660 --> 2:18:57.540
 to one's physician that things are changing over time.

2:18:57.540 --> 2:19:00.580
 And it seems to me that basically everyone should get

2:19:00.580 --> 2:19:02.500
 at least a once a year blood test.

2:19:02.500 --> 2:19:05.040
 Is there the hope that insurance will someday

2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:06.060
 just cover it for everybody?

2:19:06.060 --> 2:19:07.260
 This will be standard care.

2:19:07.260 --> 2:19:10.500
 I would think that everybody should know what sorts

2:19:10.500 --> 2:19:12.140
 of things are floating around in their bloodstream

2:19:12.140 --> 2:19:14.740
 and what they need more of and less of in life.

2:19:14.740 --> 2:19:17.940
 I doubt it will ever be covered by insurance.

2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:19.620
 In many cases, you could make an argument

2:19:19.620 --> 2:19:21.300
 that it's indicated.

2:19:21.300 --> 2:19:24.640
 As insurance begins to cover more of the population

2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:29.640
 for pathologies, the things like FSAs or HSAs

2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:34.420
 or care credit will likely cover this advanced testing,

2:19:34.420 --> 2:19:37.500
 which it continues to come down and down in price.

2:19:37.500 --> 2:19:40.020
 So it'll be affordable, but it won't be free.

2:19:40.020 --> 2:19:41.400
 Got it. Yeah.

2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:43.940
 I'd like to shift gears slightly and talk about

2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:48.900
 social interactions and relational effects on hormones.

2:19:48.900 --> 2:19:50.660
 Something that I just find fascinating.

2:19:50.660 --> 2:19:52.060
 We touched on this a little bit earlier

2:19:52.060 --> 2:19:53.480
 with in terms of oral contraception,

2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:55.360
 but now that we have the backdrop

2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:57.280
 of what these various hormones do,

2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:00.060
 some involvement in neurotransmitter systems like dopamine

2:20:00.060 --> 2:20:02.660
 and prolactin and associated pathways,

2:20:02.660 --> 2:20:03.780
 prolactin of course being a hormone,

2:20:03.780 --> 2:20:04.780
 not a neurotransmitter.

2:20:04.780 --> 2:20:09.780
 But there's a phenomenon in human beings

2:20:09.780 --> 2:20:13.220
 where people get very excited about a new partner

2:20:14.500 --> 2:20:16.660
 and that excitement no doubt is related

2:20:16.660 --> 2:20:18.960
 to the dopamine system among other systems.

2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:21.060
 And that excitement can be maintained

2:20:21.060 --> 2:20:22.300
 or can wane over time.

2:20:22.300 --> 2:20:23.580
 And here I'm talking about attraction,

2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:25.440
 but I'm also talking about just general excitement

2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:26.400
 in the sense of novelty,

2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:29.360
 because that's what dopamine is associated with.

2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:33.460
 Given that you work with human beings

2:20:33.460 --> 2:20:36.520
 and they have lives and relationships and lifestyles

2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:39.220
 and they have hormones and all these things interact,

2:20:39.220 --> 2:20:42.220
 what are some of the ways that we could think about

2:20:42.220 --> 2:20:47.220
 adjusting our relationships in order to optimize hormones,

2:20:48.060 --> 2:20:51.460
 as opposed to just thinking about how to optimize hormones

2:20:51.460 --> 2:20:52.580
 for sake of our relationship?

2:20:52.580 --> 2:20:55.020
 Because it's bi-directional, of course.

2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:57.860
 And this assumes, I should say,

2:20:57.860 --> 2:20:59.860
 that one is already paying attention

2:20:59.860 --> 2:21:02.300
 to the six pillars talked about earlier,

2:21:02.300 --> 2:21:04.420
 that people are doing most things right.

2:21:04.420 --> 2:21:07.100
 How should we think about relationships and hormones?

2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:09.620
 Friendships, romantic relationships, new partners,

2:21:09.620 --> 2:21:11.080
 long-term partners.

2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:15.060
 How do you think about this kind of stuff?

2:21:15.060 --> 2:21:18.420
 Yeah, so if you have a new partner,

2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:22.140
 then it is largely regulated by the dopaminergic system,

2:21:22.140 --> 2:21:23.460
 which changes over time.

2:21:23.460 --> 2:21:25.340
 So people may have heard the saying

2:21:25.340 --> 2:21:28.160
 that you have to go through a full calendar year

2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:29.860
 with someone that you're in a relationship so that you-

2:21:29.860 --> 2:21:31.020
 Very good advice, by the way.

2:21:31.020 --> 2:21:34.780
 So that you really know what to do and what not to do.

2:21:34.780 --> 2:21:37.940
 But because you experience both of your families

2:21:37.940 --> 2:21:40.200
 and the holidays and all the different situations,

2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:44.460
 but I would argue until you have moved in together,

2:21:44.460 --> 2:21:46.780
 had a baby, and then raised that baby,

2:21:47.660 --> 2:21:48.740
 preferably breastfeeding,

2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:50.780
 because that's when you get the prolactin spikes,

2:21:50.780 --> 2:21:54.100
 you aren't really gone through every stage in life yet.

2:21:54.100 --> 2:21:55.020
 Now, you can't really do that

2:21:55.020 --> 2:21:56.560
 with every person that you're considering.

2:21:56.560 --> 2:21:59.820
 Well, some people do, but it can be quite costly

2:21:59.820 --> 2:22:02.900
 in terms of time and finances and emotionally costly.

2:22:04.020 --> 2:22:05.360
 And then here, I'm definitely not referring

2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:06.980
 to any personal experience

2:22:06.980 --> 2:22:08.740
 of having done all that many times over,

2:22:08.740 --> 2:22:13.740
 but what would you suggest people do or think about

2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:16.220
 as they enter relationship

2:22:16.220 --> 2:22:18.500
 or for people that are in long-term relationships

2:22:18.500 --> 2:22:21.220
 where they feel like something has shifted,

2:22:21.220 --> 2:22:24.860
 and indeed, those shifts may reflect the output

2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:27.140
 of different hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems.

2:22:27.140 --> 2:22:28.940
 It almost certainly has to be the case, right?

2:22:28.940 --> 2:22:29.820
 Yeah.

2:22:29.820 --> 2:22:33.540
 So just like women who spend a lot of time together,

2:22:33.540 --> 2:22:35.020
 whether they're coworkers or whatever,

2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:38.420
 a lot of times their menstrual cycles will align.

2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:42.000
 There is a lot of pheromoneal and hormonal crosstalk,

2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.780
 including prolactin, between men and women.

2:22:44.780 --> 2:22:48.220
 So spending 100% of the time together,

2:22:48.220 --> 2:22:51.060
 this is why people think it's so hard to work together

2:22:51.060 --> 2:22:54.180
 and live together, they're around each other 24-7.

2:22:54.180 --> 2:22:55.580
 You don't have the reprieve

2:22:55.580 --> 2:22:58.260
 where you let that dopamine settle down

2:22:58.260 --> 2:23:00.740
 and then you're excited when you see them again.

2:23:00.740 --> 2:23:03.720
 A lot of guys know that if they've gone on a hunting trip

2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:05.140
 or if they've gone on a trip for a long time,

2:23:05.140 --> 2:23:07.860
 they come back and they see their partner

2:23:07.860 --> 2:23:10.140
 and it's like a new, not quite like a new relationship,

2:23:10.140 --> 2:23:11.940
 but almost like a new relationship,

2:23:11.940 --> 2:23:13.660
 and they have that excitement again.

2:23:13.660 --> 2:23:16.440
 And purposely building that into every relationship

2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:18.180
 can help significantly,

2:23:18.180 --> 2:23:21.100
 especially if you choose to have a child

2:23:21.100 --> 2:23:23.080
 or get pregnant or be breastfeeding,

2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:24.760
 because you just plan ahead

2:23:24.760 --> 2:23:26.740
 for both of your prolactins to be high

2:23:26.740 --> 2:23:28.820
 and both of your dopamines to be low

2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.800
 and both of your testosterone to be low.

2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:36.680
 So there's a lot of planning that you can do.

2:23:36.680 --> 2:23:41.680
 Essentially every relationship goes through a crisis

2:23:41.740 --> 2:23:46.580
 and that crisis is personal between the two of you

2:23:46.580 --> 2:23:51.160
 and you can plan ahead and figure out a way,

2:23:51.160 --> 2:23:52.660
 maybe it's not supplementation,

2:23:52.660 --> 2:23:55.100
 maybe it's not even the amount of time

2:23:55.100 --> 2:23:56.880
 you spend away from each other,

2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:00.400
 but plan ahead to have good times

2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:02.600
 if you know you're about to go into a crisis.

2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:03.440
 Got it.

2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:05.280
 And so it sounds like time apart and time together,

2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:07.460
 which is actually built into a number of cultures

2:24:07.460 --> 2:24:10.380
 where men and women will purposefully avoid each other

2:24:10.380 --> 2:24:11.380
 for some period of time,

2:24:11.380 --> 2:24:13.620
 avoid physical touch and maybe in proximity,

2:24:13.620 --> 2:24:14.660
 and then we'll reconvene.

2:24:14.660 --> 2:24:18.300
 And yet those are very stable relationships over time often.

2:24:18.300 --> 2:24:21.020
 Is the inverse also true?

2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:21.860
 For instance, for people

2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:24.160
 that are in long distance relationships

2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:25.420
 where they're only seeing each other

2:24:25.420 --> 2:24:27.660
 three or four days a week or two days a week,

2:24:28.860 --> 2:24:32.080
 does this explain the fact that some of those relationships

2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:33.640
 can go on for a very long period of time

2:24:33.640 --> 2:24:36.220
 without ever actually entering the,

2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:38.020
 let's call it the hyperprolactin phase

2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:40.940
 of actually moving in together and et cetera, et cetera.

2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:42.140
 Like in other words,

2:24:42.140 --> 2:24:45.980
 is that a way in which people are spiking

2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:48.340
 and troughing dopamine that keeps them attached?

2:24:48.340 --> 2:24:52.500
 This kind of elusive, this sort of, what is it called?

2:24:52.500 --> 2:24:54.300
 I think it's called like a cat string.

2:24:54.300 --> 2:24:56.540
 Like if you play with a cat and you move the string away,

2:24:56.540 --> 2:24:57.380
 they'll keep reaching,

2:24:57.380 --> 2:24:58.420
 but you throw the string on the ground,

2:24:58.420 --> 2:24:59.860
 they're like, they're totally uninterested in it.

2:24:59.860 --> 2:25:01.220
 Is that what's going on?

2:25:01.220 --> 2:25:02.940
 Cause that's a dopaminergic phenomenon,

2:25:02.940 --> 2:25:04.460
 the cat string example.

2:25:04.460 --> 2:25:06.100
 We know this experimentally.

2:25:06.100 --> 2:25:09.400
 In those cases, the relationship hasn't really progressed

2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:13.420
 in many of those cases past the dopamine spike,

2:25:13.420 --> 2:25:15.800
 the fun initial stage, honeymoon stage,

2:25:15.800 --> 2:25:17.060
 whatever you want to call it.

2:25:17.060 --> 2:25:19.340
 So it's almost kind of like a roommate.

2:25:19.340 --> 2:25:20.560
 If you're looking for a roommate,

2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:23.340
 if it was for college or after college or whatever,

2:25:23.340 --> 2:25:26.300
 you can fill out forms and look for common interests,

2:25:26.300 --> 2:25:28.900
 but until you're actually together

2:25:28.900 --> 2:25:31.340
 a significant proportion of the time,

2:25:31.340 --> 2:25:32.160
 you're not really going to know

2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:34.460
 if you're going to be compatible or not.

2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:39.460
 And is there evidence that the appearance of an infant

2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:43.380
 changes, obviously there are going to be hormonal shifts.

2:25:43.380 --> 2:25:47.460
 We know actually that for, in both women and in men,

2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:50.980
 there's a prolactin increase when couples

2:25:50.980 --> 2:25:53.020
 are expecting a child.

2:25:53.020 --> 2:25:55.260
 This is the, it's almost like a brooding phenomenon.

2:25:55.260 --> 2:25:58.380
 You see this in birds where it's actually called brooding

2:25:58.380 --> 2:26:00.360
 and it's caused by prolactin increase,

2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:03.180
 but it turns out this also occurs in humans.

2:26:03.180 --> 2:26:05.020
 And some people would argue this causes

2:26:05.020 --> 2:26:06.380
 the dad bod phenomenon,

2:26:06.380 --> 2:26:07.660
 cause it actually prolactin is involved

2:26:07.660 --> 2:26:10.460
 in laying down a body fat, preparing for sleepless nights.

2:26:10.460 --> 2:26:12.420
 And presumably that spike in prolactin

2:26:12.420 --> 2:26:15.100
 is there also to suppress sexual activity

2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:17.460
 because there are periods of time immediately

2:26:17.460 --> 2:26:22.180
 near childbirth where sexual activity is not advantageous.

2:26:22.180 --> 2:26:25.860
 Yeah, you see a prolactin spike right after breastfeeding.

2:26:25.860 --> 2:26:28.620
 So if you think about it, often when you have an infant,

2:26:30.460 --> 2:26:33.140
 you'll breastfeed, put the infant to bed

2:26:33.140 --> 2:26:35.060
 and then immediately go to bed with your partner,

2:26:35.060 --> 2:26:36.780
 which is not particularly conducive.

2:26:36.780 --> 2:26:40.000
 It's almost like trying to have intercourse back to back.

2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:41.340
 And it's very difficult.

2:26:41.340 --> 2:26:43.260
 Because of the, in the prolactin sense.

2:26:43.260 --> 2:26:46.220
 Yeah, low dopamine, high prolactin.

2:26:46.220 --> 2:26:48.860
 Oxytocin is also increased significantly

2:26:48.860 --> 2:26:51.380
 to help with milk let down as well.

2:26:51.380 --> 2:26:54.380
 So yeah, as far as brooding,

2:26:54.380 --> 2:26:58.740
 there's definitely a human equivalent of brooding.

2:26:58.740 --> 2:27:03.280
 Some humans call it nesting instinct, which is both helpful,

2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:07.440
 but it's not necessarily a bad change in relationship.

2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:09.020
 It's just a change.

2:27:09.020 --> 2:27:11.240
 And as long as you know that it's coming,

2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:12.180
 you're gonna do better with it.

2:27:12.180 --> 2:27:14.260
 Just like any medication,

2:27:14.260 --> 2:27:16.280
 if you are aware of the side effect

2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:19.300
 and then it might happen, then when it happens,

2:27:19.300 --> 2:27:23.140
 it's not only less severe,

2:27:23.140 --> 2:27:25.160
 it also happens less often.

2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:26.000
 Very interesting.

2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:26.820
 You tell the patient.

2:27:26.820 --> 2:27:28.300
 Well, as a neuroscientist,

2:27:28.300 --> 2:27:30.380
 I come from the framework that,

2:27:30.380 --> 2:27:32.720
 of course hormones impact perception and behavior,

2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:35.080
 but perception and behavior also impact hormones.

2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:36.020
 I found this fascinating.

2:27:36.020 --> 2:27:37.920
 I also really liked the example you gave

2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:40.000
 of people taking time apart,

2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.820
 but also these affiliative bonds that are non-romantic bonds

2:27:43.820 --> 2:27:47.740
 can serve as kind of a reservoir to replenish dopamine

2:27:48.740 --> 2:27:51.540
 that is then released upon experience

2:27:51.540 --> 2:27:52.900
 going back to one's partner

2:27:52.900 --> 2:27:54.860
 or some sort of regular feature of home.

2:27:56.420 --> 2:27:57.260
 Very interesting.

2:27:57.260 --> 2:27:59.020
 And of course this should exist on both sides.

2:27:59.020 --> 2:28:02.380
 I'm guessing that from both the male side and female side,

2:28:02.380 --> 2:28:05.220
 there's an interest in kind of separation and reunion

2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:06.260
 as the theme.

2:28:06.260 --> 2:28:09.000
 And I guess the frequency will vary for different couples

2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:10.420
 in different situations.

2:28:10.420 --> 2:28:11.260
 Yeah.

2:28:11.260 --> 2:28:13.620
 And I don't wanna make it seem like prolactin is all bad.

2:28:13.620 --> 2:28:16.540
 So prolactin does help with the nesting instinct.

2:28:16.540 --> 2:28:19.140
 It helps with breastfeeding as well.

2:28:19.140 --> 2:28:22.540
 A lot of women are diagnosed with luteal phase defects,

2:28:22.540 --> 2:28:25.120
 which is basically the phase after ovulation,

2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:26.980
 but before a period or giving birth.

2:28:26.980 --> 2:28:29.840
 The pregnancy is kind of a prolonged luteal phase.

2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:33.060
 And a lot of them will go on progesterone for this.

2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:35.900
 Progesterone can also decrease prolactin.

2:28:35.900 --> 2:28:38.020
 And prolactin is also helpful

2:28:38.020 --> 2:28:40.300
 for the maturity of the lungs and infants.

2:28:40.300 --> 2:28:43.380
 So it helps the sphingomyelin to lechithin ratio.

2:28:43.380 --> 2:28:44.780
 So it can decrease,

2:28:44.780 --> 2:28:46.700
 if your prolactin is too low through pregnancy,

2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:49.340
 it spikes up very high during pregnancy,

2:28:49.340 --> 2:28:51.400
 then it can lead to increased risk

2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:54.120
 of respiratory distress of the newborn.

2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:54.960
 Really interesting.

2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.660
 Yeah, so we certainly don't wanna paint a picture

2:28:56.660 --> 2:29:00.840
 where prolactin is the bad, bad hormone to avoid.

2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:04.700
 Without prolactin, none of us would be here, of course.

2:29:04.700 --> 2:29:05.940
 It's so vital.

2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:07.700
 I realized that earlier I raised the question

2:29:07.700 --> 2:29:09.940
 about whether or not cold exposure

2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:11.900
 could modify hormone output.

2:29:11.900 --> 2:29:13.780
 In particular, whether or not ice baths

2:29:13.780 --> 2:29:16.260
 or ice applied to specific tissues of the body,

2:29:16.260 --> 2:29:19.540
 as people are doing one way or the other,

2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:24.020
 can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels.

2:29:24.020 --> 2:29:26.360
 In other words, taking ice baths in cold showers

2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:28.780
 increase testosterone and or estrogen.

2:29:28.780 --> 2:29:32.580
 Yeah, so taking an ice bath or a cold shower

2:29:32.580 --> 2:29:34.420
 or a cold exposure in general,

2:29:34.420 --> 2:29:36.780
 it's not gonna correct a vitamin D deficiency

2:29:36.780 --> 2:29:38.420
 or a metabolic syndrome.

2:29:38.420 --> 2:29:40.740
 So there's a lot of things that it will not correct

2:29:40.740 --> 2:29:44.660
 that are causes of hypogonadism or low testosterone,

2:29:44.660 --> 2:29:47.060
 but it will help acutely,

2:29:47.060 --> 2:29:50.100
 specifically the application of cold

2:29:50.100 --> 2:29:52.540
 to testes that are too warm.

2:29:52.540 --> 2:29:55.020
 So if you have a varicocele

2:29:55.020 --> 2:29:58.660
 or if you have a little bit of a primary hypogonadism,

2:29:58.660 --> 2:30:02.740
 which is where testosterone is not released by the testes,

2:30:02.740 --> 2:30:06.680
 but your LH and FSH signals are sufficiently high,

2:30:06.680 --> 2:30:11.020
 then you'll likely respond to cold exposure better.

2:30:11.020 --> 2:30:12.340
 And there's actually undergarments

2:30:12.340 --> 2:30:15.780
 that are designed specifically to help with fertility.

2:30:15.780 --> 2:30:16.780
 And there's probably gonna be more

2:30:16.780 --> 2:30:18.080
 and more of that in the future.

2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:20.240
 You just need to be careful not to get frostbite

2:30:20.240 --> 2:30:23.620
 because it's a particularly bad spot to get frostbite.

2:30:23.620 --> 2:30:24.460
 Noted.

2:30:25.380 --> 2:30:26.780
 Could you define varicocele?

2:30:26.780 --> 2:30:28.280
 You mentioned it a few times.

2:30:28.280 --> 2:30:30.380
 That's a varicose vein?

2:30:30.380 --> 2:30:33.100
 Yeah, so it's essentially a varicose vein.

2:30:33.100 --> 2:30:36.900
 It brings warm blood and the venous flow

2:30:36.900 --> 2:30:39.380
 or the flow back to the heart is not as good.

2:30:39.380 --> 2:30:42.040
 Just like in the legs, it can happen in the scrotum.

2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:44.340
 Usually about 20 to 25% of people

2:30:44.340 --> 2:30:46.420
 have one grade of varicocele.

2:30:46.420 --> 2:30:49.140
 There's grades one through four, one through five.

2:30:49.140 --> 2:30:51.420
 And most people just have a very mild one,

2:30:51.420 --> 2:30:52.980
 usually on the left side,

2:30:52.980 --> 2:30:55.020
 because the blood has to go through further

2:30:55.020 --> 2:30:56.620
 to get back to the heart.

2:30:56.620 --> 2:31:00.100
 And it raises the temperature of the testes.

2:31:00.100 --> 2:31:01.940
 Temperature is the enemy of testes.

2:31:01.940 --> 2:31:04.620
 So they like to be five to 10 degrees cooler

2:31:04.620 --> 2:31:05.940
 than the rest of the body.

2:31:05.940 --> 2:31:09.140
 So are saunas particularly bad for sperm production?

2:31:09.140 --> 2:31:10.780
 They can be, yeah.

2:31:10.780 --> 2:31:11.780
 When you say can be,

2:31:11.780 --> 2:31:13.900
 how long could one safely be in the sauna?

2:31:13.900 --> 2:31:16.060
 Would you want to go back and forth

2:31:16.060 --> 2:31:18.580
 between the cold and sauna?

2:31:20.300 --> 2:31:21.940
 Are there any data?

2:31:21.940 --> 2:31:24.700
 If someone is having infertility,

2:31:24.700 --> 2:31:28.100
 then I tell them to avoid all saunas empirically.

2:31:28.100 --> 2:31:32.020
 If someone has, if they're not infertile,

2:31:32.020 --> 2:31:33.300
 but they have a low sperm count,

2:31:33.300 --> 2:31:35.420
 I also tell them to avoid.

2:31:35.420 --> 2:31:38.880
 However, it's mostly warmed water

2:31:38.880 --> 2:31:42.060
 that can raise the temperature of the testes

2:31:42.060 --> 2:31:43.540
 faster than the sauna.

2:31:43.540 --> 2:31:44.940
 So hot tubs and things of that sort.

2:31:44.940 --> 2:31:46.980
 Yeah, so hot tub and a jacuzzi,

2:31:46.980 --> 2:31:49.960
 those are enemies number one and number two of sperm.

2:31:51.020 --> 2:31:54.180
 What about ice baths and cold showers for women?

2:31:54.180 --> 2:31:57.540
 Any evidence that it can shift hormone output in women?

2:31:57.540 --> 2:31:58.680
 Yeah, it can.

2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:03.680
 It increases the activity of the beta adrenergic receptors,

2:32:05.360 --> 2:32:06.660
 even in the central nervous system

2:32:06.660 --> 2:32:08.580
 and the astrocytes as well.

2:32:08.580 --> 2:32:09.980
 So it can do a few things.

2:32:09.980 --> 2:32:14.980
 It can slightly decrease the drive for food,

2:32:15.060 --> 2:32:17.380
 which astrocytes and beta adrenergic receptors

2:32:17.380 --> 2:32:19.960
 have some medications that are weight loss medicines

2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:21.500
 also do similar things.

2:32:23.100 --> 2:32:26.860
 But it can be beneficial in women too.

2:32:26.860 --> 2:32:28.320
 But no evidence that it changes

2:32:28.320 --> 2:32:30.940
 estrogen output in women, correct?

2:32:32.020 --> 2:32:33.260
 Not that I know of.

2:32:33.260 --> 2:32:34.100
 Me either.

2:32:35.660 --> 2:32:38.920
 Peptides, lot of discussion these days about peptides.

2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:41.000
 Peptides, of course, just being strings of amino acids,

2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:42.900
 as you mentioned, very small ones,

2:32:42.900 --> 2:32:45.020
 like two amino acids like L-carnitine

2:32:45.020 --> 2:32:46.620
 all the way up to polypeptides,

2:32:46.620 --> 2:32:49.680
 which just mean many, many, many amino acids.

2:32:50.860 --> 2:32:52.760
 There are so many peptides that there's,

2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:54.900
 we should probably just do an entire episode about peptides.

2:32:54.900 --> 2:32:57.100
 But I think one of the reasons I'm hearing so much

2:32:57.100 --> 2:32:58.440
 about peptides these days

2:32:58.440 --> 2:33:00.820
 is that they are not called steroids.

2:33:00.820 --> 2:33:04.740
 You know, the name steroids, I think has been,

2:33:04.740 --> 2:33:07.540
 has come to be associated with anabolic steroids

2:33:07.540 --> 2:33:12.080
 in the context of acne, testosterone rage, et cetera.

2:33:12.080 --> 2:33:13.860
 But of course, testosterone, excuse me,

2:33:13.860 --> 2:33:16.380
 estrogen is a steroid hormone, right?

2:33:16.380 --> 2:33:19.500
 There are other steroid hormones, as we both know.

2:33:19.500 --> 2:33:23.400
 But peptides are gaining increasing popularity.

2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:25.900
 I am willing to go on record saying that you can be sure

2:33:25.900 --> 2:33:28.140
 that many of the incredible transformations

2:33:28.140 --> 2:33:29.300
 that you see in Hollywood

2:33:29.300 --> 2:33:32.340
 are the consequence of peptide use.

2:33:32.340 --> 2:33:35.900
 And I'd put my name behind that

2:33:35.900 --> 2:33:37.500
 because I'm well aware of people

2:33:37.500 --> 2:33:40.620
 that use these to prepare for roles, but athletes use them.

2:33:40.620 --> 2:33:42.420
 And then everyday people are using them too.

2:33:42.420 --> 2:33:46.740
 For instance, sermorelin, tesemorelin, ipomorlin

2:33:46.740 --> 2:33:50.220
 to stimulate the release of growth hormone

2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:52.220
 rather than taking growth hormone.

2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:56.420
 BPC-157, which is essentially a synthetic gastric juice

2:33:56.420 --> 2:33:58.800
 that normally repairs the gut,

2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:01.060
 that is being used to treat injuries.

2:34:01.060 --> 2:34:03.480
 And there are other ones as well.

2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:05.260
 What can we say generally about peptides?

2:34:05.260 --> 2:34:06.600
 Are they safe? Are they not safe?

2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:07.980
 What about sourcing?

2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:09.660
 And are there any peptides that you think

2:34:09.660 --> 2:34:12.780
 could be of particular use for people?

2:34:12.780 --> 2:34:14.380
 And we should probably also touch on peptides

2:34:14.380 --> 2:34:17.340
 that people shouldn't go anywhere near with a 10-foot pole.

2:34:17.340 --> 2:34:18.380
 Yeah, definitely.

2:34:18.380 --> 2:34:20.540
 So peptides are very heterogeneous.

2:34:20.540 --> 2:34:24.100
 There's very dangerous ones and very safe ones.

2:34:24.100 --> 2:34:27.400
 My favorite peptide is the original peptide,

2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:28.760
 which is insulin.

2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:31.340
 So insulin is a peptide.

2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:34.920
 And less than a hundred years ago,

2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:38.340
 there was a scientist studying insulin.

2:34:38.340 --> 2:34:41.660
 And at some point they saw that an animal

2:34:41.660 --> 2:34:46.420
 had its diabetes cured by insulin injection.

2:34:46.420 --> 2:34:48.820
 Less than a year later, they were injecting insulin

2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:50.900
 into every type 1 diabetic

2:34:50.900 --> 2:34:52.200
 because it was saving their lives.

2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:54.620
 And yet insulin can kill you

2:34:54.620 --> 2:34:56.980
 if you take it at the incorrect dose.

2:34:56.980 --> 2:34:57.820
 Yeah.

2:34:57.820 --> 2:35:01.160
 So just like insulin should be prescribed by a doctor,

2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:04.140
 there is over-the-counter insulin rely on, or NPH,

2:35:04.140 --> 2:35:07.960
 but ideally your insulin is prescribed by your doctor

2:35:07.960 --> 2:35:11.620
 for your diabetes as it's life-saving.

2:35:11.620 --> 2:35:14.060
 Peptides should be prescribed by doctors as well.

2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:16.540
 And there are several that are FDA approved.

2:35:16.540 --> 2:35:19.180
 So you mentioned a lot of different ones.

2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:21.260
 Let's start with tesamorylin.

2:35:21.260 --> 2:35:24.260
 So tesamorylin was recently FDA approved

2:35:24.260 --> 2:35:26.740
 for something called lipodystrophy.

2:35:26.740 --> 2:35:31.140
 It happens where body fat is displaced into abnormal areas,

2:35:31.140 --> 2:35:34.700
 often as part of AIDS or severe burns, things like that.

2:35:34.700 --> 2:35:36.780
 And it helps redistribute this body fat

2:35:36.780 --> 2:35:39.100
 and give people their quality of life back.

2:35:39.100 --> 2:35:41.860
 Tesamorylin is a GHRH,

2:35:41.860 --> 2:35:44.580
 which I kind of loop into the category of GHRPs,

2:35:44.580 --> 2:35:47.640
 so growth hormone releasing peptides.

2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:49.660
 So it's only a couple amino acids different

2:35:49.660 --> 2:35:53.800
 from endogenously produced growth hormone releasing hormone.

2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:57.460
 So growth hormone itself is also a peptide.

2:35:57.460 --> 2:36:01.140
 It's a peptide hormone, not a steroid hormone.

2:36:01.140 --> 2:36:05.620
 So you have different somatotrophs,

2:36:05.620 --> 2:36:09.040
 which are very similar to growth hormone.

2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:11.780
 Another fun fact is that HPL,

2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:13.860
 which is human placental lactogen,

2:36:13.860 --> 2:36:15.460
 we love acronyms, right?

2:36:15.460 --> 2:36:18.580
 Human placental lactogen is nearly identical

2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:19.620
 to growth hormone.

2:36:21.100 --> 2:36:24.260
 The growth hormone in pregnancy is not what causes

2:36:24.260 --> 2:36:26.600
 the sugar spike and gestational diabetes.

2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:29.100
 It's the human placental lactogen.

2:36:29.100 --> 2:36:31.220
 So if you look at twin pregnancies,

2:36:31.220 --> 2:36:35.100
 if they have two placentas or more placental tissue

2:36:35.100 --> 2:36:37.520
 making more human placental lactogen,

2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:42.300
 the risk of gestational diabetes is exponentially higher.

2:36:42.300 --> 2:36:46.580
 So this HPL is only a couple molecules

2:36:46.580 --> 2:36:48.540
 different from growth hormone.

2:36:48.540 --> 2:36:52.660
 It is interesting that these different GHRHs and GHRPs

2:36:52.660 --> 2:36:55.380
 actually have pretty different mechanisms of action.

2:36:55.380 --> 2:36:58.420
 Grelin is also a hormone that's released

2:36:58.420 --> 2:36:59.780
 when you're hungry.

2:36:59.780 --> 2:37:01.420
 This is probably one of the reasons

2:37:01.420 --> 2:37:04.380
 why you have more growth hormone release overnight.

2:37:04.380 --> 2:37:05.540
 And there's a lot of peptides

2:37:05.540 --> 2:37:07.620
 that are very similar to ghrelin.

2:37:07.620 --> 2:37:11.460
 So these peptides are not bio-identical peptides,

2:37:11.460 --> 2:37:14.460
 but they just have a couple different amino acids change.

2:37:14.460 --> 2:37:16.900
 So they're almost identical.

2:37:16.900 --> 2:37:19.220
 And they're probably going to be used in the future

2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:20.980
 for growth hormone deficiencies,

2:37:20.980 --> 2:37:23.020
 including in kids they've been studied.

2:37:23.020 --> 2:37:25.580
 So if somebody wants to increase their growth hormone output

2:37:25.580 --> 2:37:29.600
 in addition to not eating within two hours of sleep,

2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:31.100
 getting good, deep sleep,

2:37:32.180 --> 2:37:34.460
 doing all the other things in the six pillars

2:37:34.460 --> 2:37:35.420
 that you mentioned earlier,

2:37:35.420 --> 2:37:37.460
 especially resistance exercise

2:37:38.500 --> 2:37:40.180
 at some point earlier in the day,

2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:43.260
 what are the risks and benefits

2:37:43.260 --> 2:37:46.380
 of taking a growth hormone releasing hormone peptide

2:37:46.380 --> 2:37:50.100
 like sirloin, prescribed by a doctor, of course?

2:37:50.940 --> 2:37:53.420
 What should one be concerned about?

2:37:53.420 --> 2:37:54.780
 How long could one take these?

2:37:54.780 --> 2:37:57.260
 I've even heard that they can modify gene expression

2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:00.380
 so that they really are changing your hypothalamus

2:38:00.380 --> 2:38:02.820
 in very long lasting ways.

2:38:02.820 --> 2:38:05.340
 Yeah, there's definitely a lot of risk.

2:38:05.340 --> 2:38:07.580
 Tumor growth and cancer.

2:38:07.580 --> 2:38:10.340
 So you look at a type one diabetic,

2:38:10.340 --> 2:38:14.540
 they have very high incidences of various types of cancer.

2:38:14.540 --> 2:38:16.060
 They have very high growth hormone,

2:38:16.060 --> 2:38:18.960
 but low IGF-1 paradoxically.

2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:21.780
 So they would likely give you a similar cancer risk

2:38:21.780 --> 2:38:26.620
 to a type one diabetic that has very high growth hormone.

2:38:26.620 --> 2:38:29.500
 However, there are the benefits of it.

2:38:29.500 --> 2:38:33.260
 You think of lipolysis, decreased body fat,

2:38:33.260 --> 2:38:34.940
 increased lean body mass.

2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:38.460
 A lot of those, you can use other things

2:38:38.460 --> 2:38:40.300
 to get those benefits.

2:38:40.300 --> 2:38:45.300
 So then you don't need growth hormone for those benefits.

2:38:45.380 --> 2:38:48.260
 It just leaves cosmetic benefit

2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:49.900
 to which you can usually use topicals

2:38:49.900 --> 2:38:52.820
 to get your hair and your skin and your nails.

2:38:52.820 --> 2:38:55.180
 There's a lot of other things that you can do

2:38:55.180 --> 2:38:57.020
 other than growth hormone.

2:38:57.020 --> 2:39:00.860
 So a lot of people just don't need these GHRPs

2:39:00.860 --> 2:39:02.860
 if they don't have lipodystrophy

2:39:02.860 --> 2:39:05.060
 or if they don't have growth hormone deficiency.

2:39:05.060 --> 2:39:09.040
 There is other uses of them, specifically in injuries.

2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:11.300
 So I know that they've been studied.

2:39:11.300 --> 2:39:12.620
 I'm not sure if it's in the military.

2:39:12.620 --> 2:39:16.060
 We mentioned the woodpecker or the coup, contrecoup injury.

2:39:16.060 --> 2:39:16.900
 So that can obviously-

2:39:16.900 --> 2:39:17.740
 Head resulting back and forth,

2:39:17.740 --> 2:39:19.140
 then the brain basically slamming up

2:39:19.140 --> 2:39:20.320
 against the front of the skull.

2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:21.160
 So they all-

2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:24.020
 Yeah, football, heading the ball in soccer.

2:39:24.020 --> 2:39:26.980
 Definitely people who use the 50 caliber in military,

2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:29.800
 although that's a fairly small population.

2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:33.320
 And I think anyone that's hit their head hard

2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:34.240
 more than once.

2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:35.080
 Yeah.

2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:38.360
 We can talk about BPC157 for a bit,

2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:40.280
 GHK copper peptide for a bit,

2:39:41.420 --> 2:39:44.520
 TB500 or thymosin beta-4 analog.

2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:48.040
 And then we can also talk about brim melanotide,

2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:49.760
 which is melanotan three.

2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:51.960
 They have melanotan one and two,

2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:54.040
 and then they also have melanotan three and four.

2:39:54.040 --> 2:39:56.960
 Yeah, let's talk about BPC157 and melanotan.

2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:00.560
 Cause I think those are the ones that most people are eyeing,

2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:01.840
 so to speak.

2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:06.320
 So BPC157 is body protective compound, 157.

2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:09.840
 It's identical or bio-identical

2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:13.080
 to gastric protective compound, 157,

2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:14.880
 that's produced in the stomach.

2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:19.880
 So as you age, you get atrophic gastritis very often.

2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:22.600
 That's why you have less intrinsic factor,

2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:25.760
 which is kind of another peptide that binds to vitamin B12.

2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:29.000
 That's why you can get age-related B12 deficiencies.

2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.400
 So that's one reason why you have more colitis,

2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:34.040
 more diverticulitis as you age.

2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:36.640
 You don't have that gastric protective compound.

2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:41.600
 It increases VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor,

2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:45.360
 which basically makes your blood vessels grow more.

2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.520
 So that's what causes your body to form a blood vessel.

2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:53.000
 So another medication known as Avastin,

2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:57.680
 it's on the WHO's list of essential medications for cancer.

2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:01.000
 So many different types of cancer, including colon cancer,

2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:04.240
 you treat it with Avastin, which is a VEGF inhibitor.

2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:06.360
 So if you have cancer or a high cancer risk,

2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:08.680
 you probably don't want to be taking a medication

2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:11.320
 that's the exact opposite mechanism of action

2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:14.200
 as your essential anti-cancer med.

2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:15.960
 In other words, if you have cancer,

2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:18.440
 you're at risk of cancer, avoid BPC157.

2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:19.400
 Correct.

2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:21.880
 A lot of people prescribe it for six weeks.

2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:25.960
 And BPC157, so bremelanotide, that is FDA approved

2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:29.360
 for a hypoactive sexual disorder.

2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:32.440
 Tessamoralin, that's also approved for lipodystrophy.

2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:35.560
 Interestingly, another one of the melanotans

2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:38.120
 is also approved for lipodystrophy

2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:41.800
 and also deficiency in the melanocorticoid receptor.

2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:43.760
 So the receptor that receives

2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:47.240
 the alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone,

2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:48.680
 it's a very rare condition.

2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:50.760
 It's also approved for that

2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:54.440
 because if you don't take it, then you get obesity.

2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:58.040
 But BPC157 is not FDA approved,

2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:01.040
 but it is essentially standard of care at this point.

2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:04.800
 I would say if you're not counting insulin

2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:06.840
 or growth hormone as peptides,

2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:09.400
 it's one of the most commonly used peptides

2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:12.320
 and anecdotally and in some clinical literature,

2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:15.640
 it's fairly well tolerated for short periods of time.

2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:17.680
 I'm not in the camp that everybody needs to do it

2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:20.320
 two to three times a week or even daily

2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:22.720
 for six weeks, no matter what.

2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:26.880
 The major benefit is when you're gonna take it early on,

2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:29.320
 because it's gonna allow your body

2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:32.440
 to increase blood flow to the injured area

2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:34.040
 and the less blood flow it has,

2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:36.760
 for example, cartilage ligaments have horrible blood flow,

2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:38.400
 especially as people age,

2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:40.000
 it's gonna make a significant difference.

2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:42.080
 So I would wager that that Russian gymnast

2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:44.000
 that Achilles healed in one month

2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.080
 and completely from a full rupture

2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:49.240
 was likely taking BPC157 or something very similar.

2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:52.720
 I'm willing to wager on that as well, a remarkable recovery.

2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:55.720
 And so, because it is prescription,

2:42:55.720 --> 2:42:57.160
 there are non-prescription forms.

2:42:57.160 --> 2:42:59.080
 My understanding of the non-prescription forms

2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:02.120
 and the danger of going after non-prescription forms

2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:04.760
 is that oftentimes they will contain

2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:07.960
 what they claim they contain, BPC157 in this case,

2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:11.240
 but they are not adequately cleaning out the LPS,

2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:14.000
 the lipopolysaccharide, which can cause inflammation.

2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:14.920
 In fact, in the laboratory,

2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:18.440
 we use LPS to deliberately induce fever and inflammation

2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:20.680
 to study systemic inflammation.

2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:22.280
 So this is a warning to people,

2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:23.400
 if you're interested in peptides,

2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:26.360
 you absolutely need to work with a physician, in my opinion,

2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:28.360
 get it from a really good compounding pharmacy

2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:31.680
 who will clean out, that cleans out the LPS.

2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:34.360
 Because if you're buying it through a source that,

2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:36.080
 you know, a lot of people, I don't wanna name sources,

2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:37.680
 but there are these common sources on the internet

2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:39.520
 that everyone knows about, they're buying these sources,

2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:41.360
 they'll ship it to anyone essentially,

2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:45.680
 but then the LPS is really causing inflammation

2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:48.200
 and many people experience a kind of mild fever,

2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:50.240
 tingling from that when they inject it

2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:51.520
 and they're like, oh, I can feel it working.

2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:53.760
 That's probably LPS action,

2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:55.960
 which is not good for the brain.

2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:58.920
 I don't know about the, on other peripheral tissues.

2:43:58.920 --> 2:44:00.160
 I haven't heard of people dropping dead

2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:01.000
 from this stuff yet,

2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:02.520
 but I certainly wouldn't wanna be

2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:04.640
 ingesting any LPS unnecessarily.

2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:07.360
 So would you agree that you should work with a doctor?

2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:08.200
 After all, you are a doctor.

2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:10.800
 Yeah, definitely talk to your doctor about this

2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:12.960
 and talk to them about the dosing regimen as well.

2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:15.100
 So if they have you doing it for six weeks,

2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:17.960
 ask them why am I doing it for six weeks, why not?

2:44:17.960 --> 2:44:19.020
 Two weeks or why not?

2:44:19.020 --> 2:44:21.320
 As soon as I feel better, can I just stop it?

2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:22.920
 Yeah, there's a lot of good questions like that

2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:24.280
 that you should ask your doctor.

2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:25.720
 And if somebody is trying to prescribe you

2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:27.740
 a bunch of different things,

2:44:27.740 --> 2:44:30.560
 then see is this what they prescribe everybody

2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:32.560
 or is this individualized for me?

2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:35.000
 There are peptides like GHK copper peptide,

2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.040
 which is produced endogenously in the liver

2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:38.680
 more at younger ages.

2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:40.400
 That's why the liver can regenerate fully

2:44:40.400 --> 2:44:43.160
 is this a GHK copper peptide helps.

2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:44.440
 And if you're copper deficient,

2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:45.680
 which not a whole lot of people are,

2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:47.560
 but a lot of people that have had bariatric surgery

2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:49.200
 are copper deficient.

2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:51.720
 GHK copper peptide can help significantly

2:44:51.720 --> 2:44:53.240
 with your nervous system.

2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:54.540
 And it's also synergistic.

2:44:54.540 --> 2:44:57.360
 So any growth agonists like thymus and beta-4

2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:00.080
 made in kids in the thymus, which shrinks,

2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:03.040
 that's another reason why kids heal really well.

2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:06.560
 That and GHK is somewhat synergistic with BPC,

2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:08.800
 but if you don't need all three, you don't want them.

2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:10.400
 And if you don't need it for more than a week,

2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:12.960
 you don't want it for more than a week.

2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:14.400
 I really appreciate you saying that.

2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:16.560
 I often say that sometimes the best dose

2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:18.560
 of something to take is zero.

2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:21.560
 It's often the case that the best dosage is zero.

2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:22.600
 You mentioned melanotan.

2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:24.680
 There are several kinds of melanotan.

2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:26.720
 I find it a little bit of a funny conversation

2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:29.080
 because I first learned about melanotan

2:45:29.080 --> 2:45:31.760
 from reading about peptides and discovering

2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:35.280
 that people were taking, injecting melanotan to get tan

2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:38.560
 because it's in the melanin synthesis pathway.

2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:41.360
 They also discovered, this isn't an individual,

2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:44.080
 this is reading about this in various manuscripts

2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:47.080
 and peer-reviewed papers, that it could cause things

2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:49.560
 like pre-epism, like sustained erection,

2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:52.320
 that might be the last one that anyone would ever have

2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:55.040
 because of damage to the vasculature.

2:45:56.040 --> 2:45:59.200
 Also women taking melanotan as a way to get tan

2:45:59.200 --> 2:46:00.800
 and lose body fat.

2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:02.520
 So this sounds all very recreational.

2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:06.960
 Are there any clinical usage of melanotan?

2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:09.480
 So separate from the kind of extreme biohacking

2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:12.080
 cosmetic world, which is really not the main focus

2:46:12.080 --> 2:46:14.280
 of this podcast ever, more in terms

2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:18.040
 of pursuing health optimization.

2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:21.440
 Yeah, there's actually three FDA-approved indications,

2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:22.280
 believe it or not.

2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:23.280
 Not many people know about this,

2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:26.800
 but there's three well-accepted indications.

2:46:26.800 --> 2:46:29.480
 One of them is the hypoactive sexual disorder

2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:30.360
 and more in women.

2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:31.920
 That's for brimelanotide.

2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:33.840
 So those are women that have essentially

2:46:33.840 --> 2:46:38.360
 no libido whatsoever, but other hormones are in check.

2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:42.320
 Classically, it's before menopause.

2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:45.640
 So those hormonal issues are not contributing.

2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:48.400
 And when you give them this peptide,

2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:51.800
 it's also known as PT-141, it helps significantly.

2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:53.920
 A lot of times you use it in a nasal spray.

2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:55.480
 It goes straight into the central nervous system

2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:56.320
 and acts centrally.

2:46:56.320 --> 2:46:59.280
 You can also inject it and you can also take it via trochee.

2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:00.560
 Men and women take it?

2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:01.440
 Correct.

2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:05.280
 It's approved for women, but it can also help men.

2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:07.320
 And it's relatively safe.

2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:09.960
 The only relative contraindication that I tell people,

2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:10.800
 and a lot of people say,

2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:12.680
 oh, there's no side effects that I know of,

2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:15.520
 but if you have a family history of melanoma

2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:18.320
 or potentially have a melanoma and don't know about it,

2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:20.640
 that's why I'm a big advocate of germoscopy as well

2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:22.240
 and regular skin checks,

2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:23.880
 then theoretically it's gonna increase

2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:27.080
 that alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone

2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:28.360
 and it can grow that.

2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:31.280
 So that's definitely not a good thing.

2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:33.640
 So be very careful about long-term administration of it.

2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:35.840
 It's also approved for lipodystrophy,

2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:39.280
 which is the same exact thing as tesamorylin,

2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:44.280
 which I believe is also known as Evista or Agrifta.

2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:47.720
 And then it's also approved for the rare genetic condition

2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:50.960
 where your receptors or your melanocytes

2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:52.160
 don't proliferate as well.

2:47:52.160 --> 2:47:53.880
 So you usually have hypopigmentation.

2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:55.520
 It's not true albinism,

2:47:56.680 --> 2:47:59.680
 but it's associated with morbid morbid obesity

2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:02.400
 and very poor outcomes from that in childhood.

2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:04.120
 So it's used in kids actually.

2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:05.600
 Interesting.

2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:08.080
 Well, peptides are a fascinating landscape,

2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:12.640
 but thank you for that deep dive into several of them.

2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:15.160
 We will probably return to you

2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:17.520
 to talk about peptides again in the near future,

2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:19.000
 because I know there's a lot more there

2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:20.080
 and a lot of interest.

2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:23.440
 I want to talk about the sixth pillar, all right?

2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:27.800
 So just to remind people, you said diet, exercise,

2:48:27.800 --> 2:48:31.480
 wear appropriate caloric restriction, managing stress,

2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:34.760
 sleep and sunlight are critical for everyone

2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:38.120
 at all ages to manage and optimize hormone health.

2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:39.320
 Then you have the sixth category,

2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:42.560
 which is a really intriguing one, which is spirit,

2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:44.600
 which is a kind of unusual thing to hear

2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:46.160
 coming from a medical doctor,

2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:48.240
 except that I have many colleagues

2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:51.680
 and indeed our former director

2:48:51.680 --> 2:48:53.800
 of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins,

2:48:53.800 --> 2:48:55.720
 has talked about this notion of spirit.

2:48:55.720 --> 2:48:58.240
 We've talked about belief effects on this podcast before

2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:01.240
 with Ali Krum, how one's understanding of the things

2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:04.120
 that they do and their world in general

2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.440
 really creates an important effect on everything

2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:11.000
 at the level of physiology, not just psychology.

2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:12.520
 So as a physician,

2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:15.600
 how do you conceptualize the spiritual aspect

2:49:15.600 --> 2:49:17.160
 and how do you talk to patients about this

2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:19.360
 given that people walking into your clinic

2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:21.360
 presumably have a bunch of different religious

2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:22.720
 and not a religious backgrounds?

2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:23.840
 I'm sure some are atheists,

2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:25.960
 some are probably strong believers.

2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:28.080
 How do you deal with that

2:49:28.080 --> 2:49:30.520
 and how should people think about this?

2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:34.840
 Yeah, I believe it is surprisingly well-received.

2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:36.840
 You wouldn't think at first glance

2:49:36.840 --> 2:49:38.600
 that a patient really wants to talk about

2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:41.040
 their spiritual health with their doctor.

2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:43.280
 But the way I think about it and the way that it really is,

2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:44.680
 is it's like a Venn diagram

2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:47.040
 and you have a body and a mind and a soul

2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:49.440
 and you can't have one healthy without the other healthy.

2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:52.480
 Even if your mental health is phenomenal

2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:54.760
 and even if your physical health is phenomenal,

2:49:54.760 --> 2:49:57.280
 the mental aspect of spirituality,

2:49:57.280 --> 2:49:59.440
 if that piece is not there,

2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:03.920
 then that's gonna affect your body physiologically as well.

2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:06.400
 And Ali Crum's done some excellent work.

2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:09.680
 There's also been a lot of other studies regarding prayer.

2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:11.540
 And I'm a Christian, I believe in God,

2:50:11.540 --> 2:50:15.320
 and that gives me a lot of that resilience and motivation.

2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:18.140
 It gives me the cornerstone or the groundwork,

2:50:18.140 --> 2:50:20.560
 how I can interact with life.

2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:22.440
 And regardless if someone's an atheist

2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:25.440
 or regardless of what someone believes

2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:29.560
 as far as religion or the origin of the species,

2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:32.600
 they can know that their spirituality

2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:34.320
 is going to have a profound effect

2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:37.600
 on their mental and physical health as well.

2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:39.280
 People like to compartmentalize it.

2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:41.640
 So they like to talk to their doctor

2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:42.960
 only about the physical health

2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:44.280
 because it's comfortable to do that.

2:50:44.280 --> 2:50:46.760
 They only talk to their pastor or a mom

2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:50.160
 or a reiki healer for their spiritual health.

2:50:50.160 --> 2:50:52.860
 And they just talk to their therapist or psychiatrist

2:50:52.860 --> 2:50:55.080
 about their mental health.

2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:58.280
 But you need to bring all three of those things together.

2:50:58.280 --> 2:51:00.560
 It's well known that interdisciplinary clinics

2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:02.840
 lead to improved patient outcomes.

2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:04.700
 And that's just disciplines within medicine.

2:51:04.700 --> 2:51:07.500
 So that's just doctors that are specializing

2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:08.900
 in this or this.

2:51:08.900 --> 2:51:13.320
 So this takes a step back in the upper part of that tree

2:51:13.320 --> 2:51:16.160
 before you've reached those dichotomies or the split offs.

2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:18.840
 You have your body and your mind and your soul.

2:51:18.840 --> 2:51:20.680
 So your spiritual health and your mental health

2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:21.880
 and your physical health.

2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:25.960
 So if you're in line in all three of those things,

2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:28.280
 that builds the cornerstone for the rest of your health

2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:29.720
 and the rest of your life.

2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:32.240
 So if someone comes into your clinic and they say,

2:51:32.240 --> 2:51:34.240
 they're feeling one way in their body,

2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:36.400
 they're feeling one way in their emotional life,

2:51:36.400 --> 2:51:38.400
 you run their charts, you get their blood work,

2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:43.400
 and they're an atheist or they're agnostic.

2:51:44.600 --> 2:51:47.920
 What are some of the six pillar practices

2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:50.640
 that they can consider that are in keeping

2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:53.960
 with their atheism or agnosticism?

2:51:53.960 --> 2:51:57.840
 Because I have to assume that people who participate

2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:01.160
 or feel that they belong to a particular religious sect

2:52:01.160 --> 2:52:03.120
 will have particular prescriptives

2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:06.680
 from those religious sects that will direct them

2:52:06.680 --> 2:52:08.040
 towards particular types of prayer.

2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:12.320
 But how would somebody who doesn't have a prescriptive

2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:14.160
 coming to them from some other source,

2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:16.840
 what could they do or would they do?

2:52:16.840 --> 2:52:19.080
 Yeah, so I certainly don't force prayer on anybody

2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:20.240
 or anything like that.

2:52:20.240 --> 2:52:24.760
 But it's my belief that being, especially being an agnostic,

2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:28.440
 it's almost the hardest thing because if you're an atheist,

2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:31.360
 then you have some groundwork and you have some spirituality

2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:35.720
 even if it has to do with the human spirit's interaction

2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:36.960
 with the environment,

2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:39.160
 things that can't be physically explained well,

2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:41.600
 phenomenon like the work that Ali Krum does.

2:52:41.600 --> 2:52:44.720
 But if you're agnostic, you're still trying to find that.

2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:47.280
 So I hope that everybody does find

2:52:47.280 --> 2:52:52.280
 what they truly believe in as far as their own spirituality.

2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:55.840
 But yeah, that's a personal journey

2:52:56.880 --> 2:52:58.400
 from a physician standpoint.

2:52:58.400 --> 2:52:59.880
 And even if I'm friends with him as well,

2:52:59.880 --> 2:53:01.000
 from a friend standpoint,

2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:04.680
 I don't like to push anybody in any specific direction.

2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:06.520
 So I don't think that everybody

2:53:06.520 --> 2:53:08.360
 should believe what I believe.

2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:11.600
 And I don't feel like there should be any pressure

2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:14.360
 for them to believe something different.

2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:17.520
 So I think that there can be excellent physician-patient

2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:20.560
 rapport regardless of what we believe

2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:22.240
 and what our backgrounds are.

2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:23.080
 Yeah.

2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:24.920
 That's wonderful to hear.

2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:27.240
 I can say without revealing any names

2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:30.720
 that I have close colleagues that in every bin

2:53:30.720 --> 2:53:33.840
 of this spectrum, like hardcore atheists,

2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:38.240
 hardcore religious in different domains, different religions.

2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:40.800
 I don't know if I know many,

2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:43.040
 I'm agnostic as to whether or not I know any agnostics,

2:53:43.040 --> 2:53:44.880
 I should say, it's not something

2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:46.280
 that people commonly discuss,

2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:48.600
 but in the context of science and medicine,

2:53:48.600 --> 2:53:50.720
 but it's starting to happen more and more.

2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:52.720
 And certainly this issue of spirituality

2:53:52.720 --> 2:53:54.640
 is one of the areas in which neuroscience

2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:55.800
 is asking a lot of questions,

2:53:55.800 --> 2:53:59.040
 like what spiritual experiences really are

2:53:59.040 --> 2:54:00.720
 in terms of how they're grounded in the brain

2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:02.000
 or not grounded in the brain.

2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.480
 I think it's a really interesting area for discovery.

2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:06.880
 And I appreciate that you bring it up

2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:09.640
 and you bring it up in the non-pressured way that you do.

2:54:09.640 --> 2:54:11.800
 I think that it will stimulate a lot of thinking,

2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:14.960
 which is ultimately the goal of this podcast.

2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:19.360
 Well, I have one final question

2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:22.960
 that a listener insisted I ask,

2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:26.440
 and it's a very straightforward one.

2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:27.880
 It's not at all a curve ball

2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:30.360
 and not at all related to what we were just talking about,

2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:32.000
 but it was the most common question

2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.360
 when I told people that I was going to be talking to you,

2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:38.880
 which is, is caffeine problematic for hormones?

2:54:38.880 --> 2:54:39.720
 It's amazing.

2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:43.320
 I've received hundreds of the same question about caffeine.

2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:45.800
 And since it's probably the most commonly used drug

2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:48.880
 on the planet, I know it's taking us back

2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:52.880
 into the very practical, but in closing,

2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:53.720
 we're not quite there yet,

2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:57.200
 but in closing, is caffeine having an effect

2:54:57.200 --> 2:54:59.760
 one way or the other on testosterone, estrogen,

2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:04.480
 or other hormones that is positive, negative, or neutral?

2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:05.760
 Only if it affects your sleep.

2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:07.040
 So it works on adenosine,

2:55:07.040 --> 2:55:10.160
 and it can actually slightly improve allergies as well,

2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:13.040
 but negligible effect otherwise.

2:55:13.040 --> 2:55:13.880
 Great.

2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:16.240
 Well, sorry to end on such a practical brass tacks

2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:19.600
 type of question, but I did promise to the listeners

2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:21.520
 that I would ask that question.

2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:24.040
 Listen, I want to sincerely thank you.

2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:27.120
 We covered basically an endocrinology textbook,

2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:29.640
 a neuroendocrinology textbook's worth of information,

2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:32.120
 a ton of practical tips in there.

2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:33.560
 Where can people find out more about you?

2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:35.400
 We will certainly provide links.

2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:38.480
 And I guess the other question is, are you taking patients?

2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:40.520
 I'm sure you'll hear that in the various venues

2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:41.560
 where people can contact you,

2:55:41.560 --> 2:55:45.200
 but where are you active in terms of public facing work?

2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:48.080
 I'm active on Instagram, Kyle Gillette, MD.

2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:51.960
 I'm also active on the social medias of my brand new clinic,

2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:53.560
 which is Gillette Health.

2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:57.000
 That's at Gillette Health on Instagram or GilletteHealth.com.

2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:57.840
 Great.

2:55:57.840 --> 2:55:58.680
 We'll provide links to those.

2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:01.360
 And I should say that the content you've been putting out

2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:02.440
 on Instagram is terrific

2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:04.640
 because you actually point to specific studies

2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:06.780
 and you put things into actionable context,

2:56:06.780 --> 2:56:09.680
 which is very meaningful for me.

2:56:10.720 --> 2:56:13.080
 Kyle, Dr. Gillette, I should say,

2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:14.380
 thanks so much for your time.

2:56:14.380 --> 2:56:15.220
 I really appreciate it.

2:56:15.220 --> 2:56:16.640
 I know the listeners will too.

2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:17.480
 Thank you.

2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:18.420
 My pleasure.

2:56:18.420 --> 2:56:20.080
 Thank you for joining me for my discussion

2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:24.040
 about hormone health and optimization with Dr. Kyle Gillette.

2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:25.200
 As you just heard,

2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:29.880
 he is a treasure trove of actionable, clear information.

2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:32.640
 And again, you can find him teaching more about hormones

2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:35.900
 and other aspects of health on Instagram at Kyle Gillette.

2:56:35.900 --> 2:56:39.480
 That's Gillette with two T's and two L's, but no E.

2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:42.040
 Kyle Gillette, MD on Instagram

2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:44.860
 and Gillette Health on all other platforms.

2:56:44.860 --> 2:56:47.440
 And if you would like more information about his practice,

2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:50.200
 you can find that at GilletteHealth.com.

 And there you can support the podcast

2:57:30.380 --> 2:57:31.720
 at any level that you like.

2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:34.000
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.840
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.

2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:39.400
 While supplements certainly aren't necessary for everybody,

2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:41.720
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:44.200
 for things like optimizing sleep and focus

2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:45.800
 and indeed hormone health.

2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:47.880
 Anytime you're considering taking a supplement,

2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:49.640
 you want to make sure that the supplements

2:57:49.640 --> 2:57:51.380
 are of the very highest quality.

2:57:51.380 --> 2:57:55.340
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:57:55.340 --> 2:57:56.760
 because Thorne supplements are known

2:57:56.760 --> 2:57:58.440
 to have the highest levels of stringency

2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:00.440
 in terms of the quality of their ingredients

2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:02.880
 and precision about the amounts of the ingredients

2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:03.880
 that they put in each bottle.

2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:05.860
 Meaning what is listed on the packaging

2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:07.760
 is actually what's contained in those supplements,

2:58:07.760 --> 2:58:11.180
 which is not true for many supplement companies out there.

2:58:11.180 --> 2:58:13.120
 If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,

2:58:13.120 --> 2:58:16.120
 you can go to Thorne, that thorne.com

2:58:16.120 --> 2:58:18.760
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:58:18.760 --> 2:58:21.560
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:24.200
 Also, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site,

2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:26.960
 so go to thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:29.160
 but then pass into thorne.com,

2:58:29.160 --> 2:58:31.800
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

2:58:31.800 --> 2:58:33.140
 in the Thorne catalog.

2:58:33.140 --> 2:58:34.480
 If you're not already following us

2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:39.280
 It's Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.

2:58:39.280 --> 2:58:41.760
 And there I cover science and science-based tools,

2:58:41.760 --> 2:58:43.380
 some of which overlap with the contents

2:58:43.380 --> 2:58:44.560
 of the Huberman Lab podcast,

2:58:44.560 --> 2:58:46.360
 but much of which is distinct

2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:48.680
 from the contents of the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:58:48.680 --> 2:58:50.480
 And again, we are hosting two live events,

2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:53.040
 one in Seattle on May 17th,

2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:55.600
 another in Portland on May 18th.

2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:57.820
 That series is called the Brain Body Contract,

2:58:57.820 --> 2:59:00.200
 where I'll talk about science and science-based tools,

2:59:00.200 --> 2:59:01.880
 some of which I have never talked about

2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:03.280
 in a public forum before.

2:59:03.280 --> 2:59:05.880
 And there'll be an open question and answer format

2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:07.640
 for you to ask me your questions,

2:59:07.640 --> 2:59:10.340
 and I will do my best to answer them in real time.

2:59:10.340 --> 2:59:11.800
 Thank you once again for joining me

2:59:11.800 --> 2:59:14.240
 for today's discussion with Dr. Kyle Gillette.

2:59:14.240 --> 2:59:17.360
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:26.360
 I'm Dr. Kyle Gillette, and I'll see you next time.
