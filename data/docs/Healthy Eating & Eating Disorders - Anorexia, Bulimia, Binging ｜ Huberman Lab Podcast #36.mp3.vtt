00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.260
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.260 --> 00:12.940
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.940 --> 00:15.180
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.940
 Today, we are going to talk all about

00:16.940 --> 00:19.220
 healthy and disordered eating.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.780
 And indeed, we are going to talk about

00:20.780 --> 00:22.500
 clinical eating disorders,

00:22.500 --> 00:27.100
 such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder,

00:27.100 --> 00:30.260
 as well as some other related eating disorders.

00:30.260 --> 00:32.380
 However, before we get into this material,

00:32.380 --> 00:35.020
 I want to emphasize that today's discussion

00:35.020 --> 00:37.180
 will include what it is to have

00:37.180 --> 00:39.340
 a healthy relationship with food.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.560
 We're going to talk about metabolism.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.380
 We're going to talk about how eating frequency

00:44.380 --> 00:48.700
 and what one eats influences things like appetite

00:48.700 --> 00:51.220
 and satiety, as well as whether or not

00:51.220 --> 00:54.680
 we have a healthy psychological relationship to food

00:54.680 --> 00:58.540
 and our body weight and so-called body composition,

00:58.540 --> 01:01.760
 the ratio of muscle to fat to bone, et cetera.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.040
 So as we march into this conversation,

01:05.040 --> 01:07.160
 I'd like to share with you some interesting

01:07.160 --> 01:09.080
 and what I believe are important findings

01:09.080 --> 01:13.100
 in the realm of nutrition and human behavior.

01:13.100 --> 01:16.140
 I know these days, many people are excited about

01:16.140 --> 01:19.700
 or curious about so-called intermittent fasting.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.720
 Intermittent fasting is, as the name implies,

01:22.720 --> 01:25.940
 simply restricting one's feeding behavior,

01:25.940 --> 01:29.360
 eating to a particular phase of the 24 hour

01:29.360 --> 01:32.220
 or so-called circadian cycle.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.520
 Other forms of intermittent fasting involve

01:34.520 --> 01:37.260
 not eating for extended periods of time,

01:37.260 --> 01:39.380
 for entire days, or some people will extend

01:39.380 --> 01:42.040
 to two days or three days, typically,

01:42.040 --> 01:45.580
 and hopefully they will drink water during those times,

01:45.580 --> 01:48.300
 sometimes referred to as water fasting,

01:48.300 --> 01:51.180
 which means that they are ingesting fluids

01:51.180 --> 01:53.160
 and hopefully they are ingesting electrolytes

01:53.160 --> 01:55.980
 such as salt, potassium, and magnesium as well,

01:55.980 --> 02:00.460
 because while one can survive for some period of time

02:00.460 --> 02:03.860
 without ingesting calories, it is extremely important

02:03.860 --> 02:08.020
 to continue to ingest plenty of fluids and electrolytes.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.380
 And the reason for that is that the neurons

02:10.380 --> 02:12.560
 of your brain and body that control your movements,

02:12.560 --> 02:15.940
 your thoughts, clarity of thinking in general, et cetera,

02:16.940 --> 02:19.140
 is critically dependent on the presence

02:19.140 --> 02:23.100
 of adequate levels of sodium, potassium, and magnesium,

02:23.100 --> 02:25.300
 the electrolytes, and that's because neurons

02:25.300 --> 02:28.140
 can only be electrically active by way of movement

02:28.140 --> 02:30.820
 of particular ions, which include things like sodium,

02:30.820 --> 02:32.340
 potassium, and magnesium.

02:32.340 --> 02:35.660
 So without those, you can't think, you can't function,

02:35.660 --> 02:37.600
 and it actually can be quite dangerous.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.860
 So why all the excitement about intermittent fasting?

02:40.860 --> 02:43.700
 Well, a lot of the excitement relates to work

02:43.700 --> 02:45.700
 that was done by a former colleague of mine

02:45.700 --> 02:47.900
 down at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies

02:47.900 --> 02:50.460
 in San Diego named Sachin Panda.

02:50.460 --> 02:54.040
 Sachin's lab identified some very important

02:54.040 --> 02:56.220
 and impactful health benefits

02:56.220 --> 02:59.200
 of restricting one's feeding window to particular times

02:59.200 --> 03:04.020
 within the 24-hour cycle, or even to having extended fasts

03:04.020 --> 03:06.980
 that go for a day or two days, or maybe even three days.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.700
 What they saw was an improvement in liver enzymes,

03:11.700 --> 03:14.880
 an improvement in insulin sensitivity,

03:14.880 --> 03:16.420
 which is something that is good.

03:16.420 --> 03:19.120
 It means that you can utilize the calories

03:19.120 --> 03:22.120
 and the blood sugar that you happen to have.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.960
 Being insulin-insensitive is not good

03:24.960 --> 03:27.280
 and is actually a form of diabetes.

03:28.120 --> 03:32.040
 What Sachin's lab and subsequently other labs showed

03:32.040 --> 03:34.100
 was that restricting one's feeding window

03:34.100 --> 03:37.860
 to anywhere from four to eight or even 12 hours

03:37.860 --> 03:41.420
 during each 24-hour cycle was beneficial in mice.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.660
 And some studies in humans have also shown

03:43.660 --> 03:47.200
 that it can be beneficial for various health parameters.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.060
 However, the excitement about intermittent fasting

03:51.060 --> 03:54.980
 seems to be related to the foundational truth

03:54.980 --> 03:59.260
 about metabolism and weight loss and weight maintenance

03:59.260 --> 04:03.360
 and weight gain, which is that regardless of whether or not

04:03.360 --> 04:06.300
 you intermittent fast or whether or not you eat small meals

04:06.300 --> 04:09.140
 all day long, or you eat one meal in the evening

04:09.140 --> 04:13.380
 and snack up until then, it really doesn't matter

04:13.380 --> 04:17.020
 in the sense that the calories that you ingest

04:17.020 --> 04:21.040
 from whatever source are going to be filtered

04:21.040 --> 04:25.220
 through the calories that you burn by way of exercise,

04:25.220 --> 04:26.420
 basal metabolic rate,

04:26.420 --> 04:28.740
 which is just the calories that you happen to burn,

04:28.740 --> 04:31.020
 just being alive and thinking and breathing

04:31.020 --> 04:32.700
 and your heart beating, et cetera.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.720
 And the reason why many people prefer intermittent fasting

04:36.720 --> 04:39.740
 to other forms of, let's just call it what it is,

04:39.740 --> 04:44.140
 diet or nutritional framework is that many people

04:44.140 --> 04:49.020
 find it easier to not eat than to limit their portion size.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.900
 And here I'm not talking necessarily about eating disorders,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.880
 I'm talking about the general population.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.500
 So I think that's one reason why there's so much excitement

04:56.500 --> 04:58.460
 about intermittent fasting.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.620
 Now, within the context of intermittent fasting

05:01.620 --> 05:04.860
 on a circadian timescale once every 24 hours,

05:04.860 --> 05:08.420
 you generally find two categories of people.

05:08.420 --> 05:10.940
 People who prefer to not eat in the morning,

05:10.940 --> 05:13.040
 either because they are not hungry in the morning

05:13.040 --> 05:15.780
 or because they find it relatively straightforward

05:15.780 --> 05:20.020
 to just drink things like coffee or water, et cetera,

05:20.020 --> 05:24.120
 and push their feeding window out to noon or 2 p.m.

05:24.120 --> 05:24.960
 or 3 p.m.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.180
 And then they'll eat between say 1 p.m. and 8 p.m.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.020
 or 9 p.m.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.180
 It depends on the individual.

05:31.180 --> 05:33.500
 Other groups of people find that they are very hungry

05:33.500 --> 05:34.820
 when they wake up in the morning.

05:34.820 --> 05:37.060
 They don't feel well if they don't eat breakfast.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.380
 And so they prefer to eat early in the day,

05:39.380 --> 05:40.860
 but then they limit their feeding window

05:40.860 --> 05:42.720
 such that they cut off their food intake

05:42.720 --> 05:45.420
 or stop ingesting any calories of any kind

05:45.420 --> 05:49.260
 somewhere around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., et cetera.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.020
 So the duration of the feeding window

05:51.020 --> 05:52.900
 has not been broken down

05:52.900 --> 05:55.460
 into the kind of nuanced type of information

05:55.460 --> 05:56.940
 that one would really want,

05:56.940 --> 05:58.060
 at least not in human studies,

05:58.060 --> 05:59.980
 saying, well, a six-hour feeding window

05:59.980 --> 06:02.200
 or an eight-hour feeding window is ideal.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.280
 It really is going to vary

06:03.280 --> 06:05.100
 based on lifestyle and circumstances.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.720
 For instance, some families really want

06:07.720 --> 06:09.300
 to eat dinner together every night.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.780
 So do you want to be the person

06:10.780 --> 06:12.400
 that's sitting there watching everybody eat

06:12.400 --> 06:15.420
 because you're fasting from 5 p.m. onward?

06:15.420 --> 06:16.240
 I don't know.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.660
 That's an individual difference.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.580
 What you can start to identify, however,

06:19.580 --> 06:20.700
 is that people tend to fall

06:20.700 --> 06:22.260
 into either one category or the other,

06:22.260 --> 06:24.480
 people who prefer to skip eating in the morning

06:24.480 --> 06:26.140
 or people that prefer to

06:26.140 --> 06:28.180
 or manage to skip eating in the evening.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.240
 And there has been no evidence thus far

06:31.240 --> 06:32.780
 that one is better or worse,

06:32.780 --> 06:36.440
 at least in terms of weight loss or overall health parameters.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.900
 Now, you could imagine

06:37.900 --> 06:39.720
 that some people might eat breakfast and dinner.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.460
 And indeed, I have several, many colleagues, in fact,

06:42.460 --> 06:43.800
 who just choose to skip lunch

06:43.800 --> 06:44.780
 because they're busy during the day.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.480
 They eat breakfast and dinner.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.060
 That doesn't afford the long fast associated with sleep.

06:51.060 --> 06:51.900
 What do I mean by that?

06:51.900 --> 06:53.760
 Well, if you went to sleep at 11 p.m.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.840
 and you wake up at 6 a.m.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.220
 by extending your fast until 1 p.m. in the afternoon,

06:59.220 --> 07:02.820
 you get quite a long period of no ingesting any calories.

07:02.820 --> 07:05.660
 Whereas when you don't eat during the middle of the day,

07:05.660 --> 07:07.180
 you are getting a fasting period

07:07.180 --> 07:10.340
 that's probably anywhere from four to seven hours,

07:10.340 --> 07:13.260
 but it's not linked to the longer fasting period

07:13.260 --> 07:15.420
 of not eating while you are asleep

07:15.420 --> 07:18.100
 because most all people, and I want to emphasize most,

07:18.100 --> 07:20.180
 do not eat while they are asleep.

07:20.180 --> 07:22.380
 But we are going to talk about an eating disorder

07:22.380 --> 07:26.180
 that does exist where people actually eat in their sleep.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.600
 I know it sounds pretty wild,

07:27.600 --> 07:31.640
 but indeed that eating disorder does exist

07:31.640 --> 07:35.140
 and has a very interesting underlying mechanism.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.620
 So why are we talking about this?

07:36.620 --> 07:39.540
 And in particular, why are we talking about this

07:39.540 --> 07:41.700
 during an episode that includes a discussion

07:41.700 --> 07:43.620
 about eating disorders?

07:43.620 --> 07:47.140
 The reason is nobody, not the government,

07:47.140 --> 07:50.720
 no nutritionists, no individual,

07:50.720 --> 07:52.480
 no matter how knowledgeable they are

07:52.480 --> 07:55.280
 about food and nutrition and food intake,

07:55.280 --> 08:00.280
 can define the best plan for eating for any one individual.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.020
 I'm going to repeat that.

08:02.020 --> 08:05.460
 Nobody knows what truly healthy eating is.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.820
 We only know the measurements we can take.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.940
 Liver enzymes, blood lipid profiles, body weight,

08:11.940 --> 08:14.700
 athletic performance, mental performance,

08:14.700 --> 08:16.100
 whether or not you're cranky all day,

08:16.100 --> 08:17.880
 whether or not you're feeling relaxed,

08:17.880 --> 08:19.380
 nobody knows how to define these.

08:19.380 --> 08:23.700
 And these have strong cultural and familial

08:23.700 --> 08:27.180
 and socio societal influence.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.380
 So if you hang out with people

08:28.380 --> 08:31.420
 that intermittent fast all day, that will seem normal.

08:31.420 --> 08:32.860
 If you spend time with people

08:32.860 --> 08:34.620
 that have never heard of intermittent fasting,

08:34.620 --> 08:37.780
 intermittent fasting is going to seem very abnormal.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.760
 Now we are going to talk about eating disorders

08:39.760 --> 08:41.360
 that really fall into the category

08:41.360 --> 08:44.500
 of clinically diagnosable eating disorders

08:44.500 --> 08:47.580
 for which there's actually serious health hazards

08:47.580 --> 08:49.820
 and even the serious risk of death.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.420
 We will get to that topic.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.980
 But for the time being, I want to emphasize

08:54.980 --> 08:56.660
 a new set of findings

08:56.660 --> 08:58.420
 that I think many people will find interesting

08:58.420 --> 09:00.200
 and at least will want to consider

09:00.200 --> 09:02.540
 in light of their current nutritional plan

09:02.540 --> 09:04.300
 or pattern of eating,

09:04.300 --> 09:06.860
 whether or not you're intermittent fasting or not.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.620
 And I want to cue up an important framework

09:09.620 --> 09:11.020
 for the rest of the conversation

09:11.020 --> 09:13.020
 on healthy and disordered eating,

09:13.020 --> 09:17.640
 which includes an understanding of thinking,

09:17.640 --> 09:21.700
 decision-making and what we call homeostatic processes,

09:21.700 --> 09:23.260
 meaning regulation of things

09:23.260 --> 09:24.820
 that are going on in our brain and body

09:24.820 --> 09:26.180
 and reward mechanisms.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.100
 I'm going to return to that in a moment.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.640
 But first I want to share with you these new findings

09:30.640 --> 09:32.800
 that were just published in the journal Cell Reports,

09:32.800 --> 09:35.020
 a cell press journal, excellent journal.

09:35.020 --> 09:37.900
 This was a study that was performed both in mice

09:37.900 --> 09:41.500
 and it included a crossover study with a human population.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.580
 The human population was women,

09:44.580 --> 09:46.620
 but it relates to a previous study

09:46.620 --> 09:48.600
 that was also carried out in men.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.820
 I'm going to simplify this study.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.620
 We will provide a link to the full study

09:51.620 --> 09:53.340
 so you can explore it in more detail.

09:53.340 --> 09:55.140
 And if you're really excited about the results,

09:55.140 --> 09:58.120
 I would encourage you to explore some of the references

09:58.120 --> 10:00.500
 within that paper as well.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.740
 What was the study?

10:02.740 --> 10:07.740
 The study looked at giving mice or humans two meals

10:08.260 --> 10:10.800
 and explored whether or not putting those meals

10:10.800 --> 10:14.380
 early in the day or late in the day

10:14.380 --> 10:17.580
 had an impact on muscle hypertrophy,

10:17.580 --> 10:21.420
 muscle growth and overall protein synthesis of muscle.

10:21.420 --> 10:24.820
 So when we eat the amino acids from various foods

10:24.820 --> 10:26.340
 are broken down and synthesized

10:26.340 --> 10:27.580
 into different types of tissues.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.100
 They can be utilized for energy,

10:30.100 --> 10:32.660
 burned up for moving about and thinking, et cetera,

10:32.660 --> 10:34.340
 or it can be synthesized,

10:34.340 --> 10:37.980
 those amino acids can be synthesized into skeletal muscle,

10:37.980 --> 10:39.060
 the sorts of skill to muscles

10:39.060 --> 10:40.780
 that allow you to move your limbs.

10:40.780 --> 10:45.780
 This study explored how protein intake,

10:46.540 --> 10:50.500
 which included what are called branch chain amino acids

10:50.500 --> 10:52.220
 and amino acids like leucine,

10:52.220 --> 10:54.340
 which are important for muscle protein synthesis.

10:54.340 --> 10:59.340
 It explored whether or not emphasizing or skewing

10:59.420 --> 11:04.020
 the protein intake toward early day or late day

11:04.020 --> 11:06.860
 was better in terms of muscle hypertrophy.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.940
 And they also looked at some parameters of strength

11:08.940 --> 11:10.820
 like grip strength.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.900
 Now mice are nocturnal.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.780
 So before you say, wait, mice are nocturnal,

11:14.780 --> 11:15.820
 how did they look during the day?

11:15.820 --> 11:18.340
 And it's completely, it doesn't apply because it's in mice.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.260
 Of course, they knew that.

11:20.260 --> 11:24.300
 And they looked during the mice's active phase

11:24.300 --> 11:26.840
 of their circadian cycle, which corresponds to our day.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.820
 And in humans, they looked at whether or not

11:28.820 --> 11:32.420
 eating most of one's protein early in the day

11:32.420 --> 11:34.420
 was better than if the protein intake

11:34.420 --> 11:36.180
 and these branch chain amino acids

11:36.180 --> 11:38.140
 were placed later in the day.

11:38.140 --> 11:41.220
 And yes, they had the mice do resistance training.

11:41.220 --> 11:44.380
 They did that by emphasizing overload

11:44.380 --> 11:46.980
 to one limb of the mouse.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.520
 And that actually generates hypertrophy.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.940
 It's a form of resistance training in mice.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.480
 So they don't have them weight training.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.000
 They weren't doing curls and dips and squats

11:55.000 --> 11:55.960
 and things of that sort.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.320
 They were moving their own body weight,

11:57.320 --> 11:59.660
 but they skewed that distribution of body weight

11:59.660 --> 12:03.140
 by restricting a limb and forcing them to use one limb

12:03.140 --> 12:05.500
 that did indeed grow in response to that.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.380
 And then in humans, there was an exploration of grip strength

12:08.380 --> 12:10.180
 and then with resistance training,

12:10.180 --> 12:13.460
 that was also carried out through a peripheral study.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.820
 Basically the takeaway from this study

12:15.820 --> 12:20.820
 was that mice and humans can utilize amino acids

12:20.860 --> 12:22.940
 that are ingested early in the day

12:22.940 --> 12:25.380
 better than they can utilize amino acids

12:25.380 --> 12:27.260
 ingested later in the day,

12:28.100 --> 12:31.940
 in particular toward muscle hypertrophy and growth

12:31.940 --> 12:34.380
 or maintenance of muscle,

12:34.380 --> 12:36.180
 which for those of you that aren't interested

12:36.180 --> 12:37.500
 in much muscle hypertrophy,

12:37.500 --> 12:39.020
 that aren't trying to grow your muscles,

12:39.020 --> 12:40.660
 I've talked before in the episode

12:40.660 --> 12:43.340
 on building strength and hypertrophy,

12:43.340 --> 12:45.580
 that maintaining muscle,

12:45.580 --> 12:47.840
 regardless of one's athletic prowess,

12:47.840 --> 12:50.380
 regardless of one's age is extremely important

12:51.300 --> 12:53.240
 because loss of skeletal muscle

12:53.240 --> 12:55.980
 is one of the major causes of injury as we age.

12:55.980 --> 12:58.480
 It's one of the major causes, believe it or not,

12:58.480 --> 13:03.140
 of cognitive and metabolic deficits as we age.

13:03.140 --> 13:04.780
 So maintaining muscle is important,

13:04.780 --> 13:06.600
 building muscle might be important to some of you,

13:06.600 --> 13:10.320
 but what they found was ingesting protein early in the day

13:10.320 --> 13:12.800
 and these amino acids early in the day

13:12.800 --> 13:14.480
 led to more muscle hypertrophy

13:14.480 --> 13:16.900
 than if the majority of amino acids and proteins

13:16.900 --> 13:18.460
 were ingested late in the day.

13:18.460 --> 13:21.220
 So this translates to intermittent fasting

13:21.220 --> 13:23.860
 such that if you are interested in muscle hypertrophy,

13:23.860 --> 13:25.700
 you might, and I want to emphasize might,

13:25.700 --> 13:28.560
 consider making sure that you're getting

13:28.560 --> 13:31.580
 sufficient protein intake early in the day.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.060
 What sources of protein you use

13:33.060 --> 13:34.360
 is going to be highly individual.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.660
 Some of you are meat eaters,

13:35.660 --> 13:37.100
 some of you don't eat red meat,

13:37.100 --> 13:38.980
 some of you eat chicken and fish and eggs,

13:38.980 --> 13:40.900
 some of you don't, some of you are vegans.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.480
 It has been shown that the amino acid leucine

13:43.480 --> 13:45.980
 is vital for the cell growth process,

13:45.980 --> 13:48.380
 including muscle growth because of its relationship

13:48.380 --> 13:49.980
 to the so-called mTOR pathway,

13:49.980 --> 13:52.260
 mammalian target of rapamycin.

13:52.260 --> 13:56.340
 We can talk about that more if you like in a future episode.

13:56.340 --> 13:59.080
 This means that if you're somebody who wants to maintain

13:59.080 --> 14:02.440
 or increase the amount of muscle mass that you have,

14:03.440 --> 14:05.680
 ingesting a high protein meal early in the day

14:05.680 --> 14:07.900
 ought to be beneficial for that.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.940
 Does it mean that you should not eat protein

14:09.940 --> 14:11.980
 in the afternoon and evening?

14:11.980 --> 14:14.180
 No, I think a lot of people

14:14.180 --> 14:15.620
 might've misinterpreted this study

14:15.620 --> 14:17.860
 and I don't want that to happen.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.880
 This is only pointing out the fact

14:19.880 --> 14:23.280
 that ingesting sufficient quality amino acids,

14:23.280 --> 14:26.620
 including leucine, early in the day

14:26.620 --> 14:29.360
 can be beneficial for maintenance

14:29.360 --> 14:30.880
 and growth of muscle tissue.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.680
 It does not say that you should avoid protein

14:33.680 --> 14:34.980
 later in the day.

14:34.980 --> 14:38.500
 Now for you intermittent fasters, this could be relevant.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.460
 I, for instance, was somebody who for a very long time

14:41.460 --> 14:42.580
 skipped breakfast.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.220
 My first meal of the day would be in the early afternoon,

14:45.220 --> 14:48.860
 mostly protein and salad, in my case, animal protein,

14:48.860 --> 14:51.780
 because that's in alignment with my values.

14:51.780 --> 14:55.420
 Then in the evening, I would eat pasta, vegetables, et cetera.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.360
 I might have some protein, some small piece of fish

14:57.360 --> 14:58.380
 or chicken or something like that,

14:58.380 --> 15:00.660
 but I didn't really emphasize that.

15:00.660 --> 15:03.580
 On the basis of these results, I am experimenting with,

15:03.580 --> 15:05.140
 I want to emphasize experimenting with,

15:05.140 --> 15:08.740
 I haven't completely tossed out my old protocol,

15:08.740 --> 15:12.700
 but I'm experimenting with eating proteins early in the day

15:12.700 --> 15:14.020
 and eating lunch.

15:14.020 --> 15:17.620
 And then dinner might be a light supper of some sort,

15:17.620 --> 15:20.500
 but not so much protein later in the evening.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.220
 Again, if you want to eat six meals a day,

15:22.220 --> 15:24.140
 you want to eat around the clock, I'm not going to stop you.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.420
 I'm not telling anybody what to do.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.000
 As I mentioned earlier, nobody knows exactly how to eat

15:28.000 --> 15:29.340
 for one's particular goals.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.780
 But this study was really interesting

15:30.780 --> 15:34.140
 because it really did show that we can utilize the proteins

15:34.140 --> 15:36.460
 that are ingested early in the day better

15:36.460 --> 15:37.740
 than we can utilize the proteins

15:37.740 --> 15:39.360
 that are ingested later in the day.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.860
 And of course, there will be factors that can shift that.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.520
 For instance, if you work out very hard

15:44.520 --> 15:46.380
 with resistance training later in the day,

15:46.380 --> 15:49.820
 resistance training is known to increase protein synthesis.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.620
 So it stands to reason that ingesting amino acids

15:52.620 --> 15:54.780
 after that training would be beneficial.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.340
 However, in the study, it did not seem to matter

15:57.340 --> 15:58.860
 when the resistance training fell

15:58.860 --> 16:00.480
 within the 24 hour schedule.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.140
 The morning ingestion or early day ingestion of amino acids

16:05.140 --> 16:06.420
 seemed to be beneficial.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.260
 How early?

16:07.260 --> 16:11.620
 Between the hours of about 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. for humans.

16:11.620 --> 16:15.860
 Now, just a bit of mechanism to explain why this happens.

16:15.860 --> 16:18.940
 So why would it be that ingesting protein early in the day

16:18.940 --> 16:21.120
 would lead to more synthesis of muscle

16:21.120 --> 16:23.420
 than ingesting protein later in the day?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.780
 And the reason it turns out is related

16:25.780 --> 16:27.940
 to the circadian clock mechanism

16:27.940 --> 16:30.840
 that is present in all cells, including muscle cells.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.060
 So muscles have fibers.

16:32.060 --> 16:33.380
 I think most people are aware of that,

16:33.380 --> 16:36.060
 that your muscles are not just one big blob of tissue.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.480
 A lot of these little fibers that contract.

16:39.620 --> 16:44.100
 Within those fibers, however, there are cells with nuclei.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.740
 Those nuclei contain DNA.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.660
 DNA is transcribed into RNA.

16:48.660 --> 16:51.400
 RNA is translated into proteins.

16:52.820 --> 16:55.820
 The DNA of your cells, including these muscle cells,

16:55.820 --> 16:58.880
 are under strong circadian regulation.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.620
 Each one has a pattern of gene expression

17:01.620 --> 17:03.500
 that is different at different times

17:03.500 --> 17:05.020
 during the 24 hour cycle.

17:05.020 --> 17:09.960
 This is an unescapable reality of all cells in your body,

17:09.960 --> 17:12.140
 right from your hair cells to your brain cells

17:12.140 --> 17:16.220
 to your retinal cells, to your toe on both feet.

17:16.220 --> 17:19.220
 These cells make a gene called BMAL.

17:19.220 --> 17:22.180
 BMAL, B-M-A-L, is a clock gene.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.060
 And the expression of this clock gene

17:24.060 --> 17:26.400
 varies across the 24 hour cycle.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.780
 And proteins that are downstream of this BMAL gene

17:29.780 --> 17:31.520
 influence protein synthesis.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.420
 The circadian regulation of this BMAL gene

17:35.420 --> 17:37.220
 turns out to be vitally important

17:37.220 --> 17:40.180
 for this protein synthesis mechanism.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.060
 How do we know that?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.620
 Well, in this particular study,

17:42.620 --> 17:47.160
 because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,

17:47.160 --> 17:48.760
 the gene was knocked out.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.820
 They had a bunch of these mice.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.480
 They were able to explore whether or not

17:52.480 --> 17:56.780
 this early day feeding effect was present or absent

17:56.780 --> 17:59.180
 in these mice that lack the gene BMAL.

17:59.180 --> 18:00.540
 And indeed it was absent.

18:00.540 --> 18:03.620
 In other words, the effect of increased protein synthesis

18:03.620 --> 18:05.260
 early in the day was eliminated

18:05.260 --> 18:07.140
 in the absence of the BMAL gene.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.740
 So what this means is that when you wake up in the morning,

18:10.740 --> 18:12.740
 assuming you're following a standard schedule

18:12.740 --> 18:15.580
 of being asleep at night and awake during the day,

18:15.580 --> 18:19.040
 your muscle cells are primed to incorporate amino acids

18:19.040 --> 18:20.640
 and synthesize muscle,

18:20.640 --> 18:22.340
 regardless of whether or not you weight train

18:22.340 --> 18:24.080
 the night before at 8 p.m.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.260
 where you don't weight train at all

18:25.260 --> 18:27.300
 or you weight train afterwards or before.

18:28.620 --> 18:31.840
 I said 5 to 10 p.m. is the sort of critical window

18:31.840 --> 18:33.720
 for this increased protein synthesis.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.780
 All this means is that if you are interested

18:35.780 --> 18:39.220
 in maintaining or enhancing muscle tissue volume,

18:39.220 --> 18:44.220
 that you might want to consider eating quality protein

18:44.860 --> 18:47.280
 and amino acids early in the day.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.700
 You could train first, you could train after,

18:49.700 --> 18:51.100
 you could not train at all.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.180
 That's a entirely different discussion.

18:54.180 --> 18:55.740
 What is quality protein?

18:55.740 --> 18:57.660
 Well, quality protein is going to be a protein

18:57.660 --> 19:00.420
 that includes most of the essential amino acids

19:00.420 --> 19:01.780
 and in particular, leucine.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.920
 Now there's a lot of debate as to whether or not

19:04.920 --> 19:07.160
 you can get all the essential amino acids

19:07.160 --> 19:08.640
 from a purely plant-based diet

19:08.640 --> 19:10.180
 or whether or not you need to ingest

19:10.180 --> 19:12.380
 animal-based foods or not.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.300
 The term quality protein

19:14.300 --> 19:17.160
 has no strict scientific definition.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.260
 Some people define quality protein as a protein

19:20.260 --> 19:24.840
 that has a high essential amino acid to caloric ratio.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.500
 Now, what that means is a small piece of chicken or steak

19:28.500 --> 19:32.660
 or eggs, for instance, will have many essential amino acids

19:32.660 --> 19:37.660
 with a low caloric content relative to say beans

19:37.660 --> 19:40.660
 or plant-based foods that can also get you

19:40.660 --> 19:43.340
 essential amino acids, but it requires more calories

19:43.340 --> 19:47.080
 to access those essential amino acids.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.440
 Now that's a debate that has many exceptions and nuances.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.300
 And I, for one, am perfectly respectful of the folks

19:53.300 --> 19:55.940
 that just want to ingest plant-based foods

19:55.940 --> 19:57.880
 in order to get their high quality protein.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.820
 I think that actually can be done.

19:59.820 --> 20:02.580
 One has to be careful and thoughtful in their choices

20:02.580 --> 20:03.620
 about how to do that.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.660
 So this really isn't about animal-based

20:05.660 --> 20:07.420
 versus non-animal-based foods.

20:07.420 --> 20:11.240
 This is about getting quality amino acids early in the day

20:11.240 --> 20:14.140
 from whatever foods are in alignment

20:14.140 --> 20:16.580
 with your particular values in your particular eating plan.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.600
 So that's a lot of information,

20:18.600 --> 20:21.900
 but the key takeaways are every cell in your muscles

20:21.900 --> 20:23.320
 has a clock gene.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.180
 The clock genes vary such that protein synthesis

20:27.180 --> 20:30.420
 is greater early in the day than it is later in the day,

20:30.420 --> 20:33.320
 such that in both mice and in humans,

20:33.320 --> 20:36.500
 ingestion of quality proteins early in the day

20:36.500 --> 20:39.660
 will be more so incorporated into muscle

20:39.660 --> 20:42.300
 than the proteins that are ingested late in the day.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.500
 And of course, there are the caveats of

20:45.500 --> 20:47.640
 if you're training hard late in the day,

20:47.640 --> 20:49.540
 if you're adjusting your hormone status

20:49.540 --> 20:52.060
 through whatever mechanism, et cetera,

20:52.060 --> 20:54.920
 protein synthesis can also be high later in the day.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.660
 But for most people, it's going to taper off

20:56.660 --> 21:00.460
 due to this circadian B-mal gene-related mechanism.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.780
 Again, we will provide a link to the study.

21:02.780 --> 21:06.140
 And the other key takeaways were that nobody knows,

21:06.140 --> 21:09.220
 nobody can tell you what healthy feeding windows are,

21:09.220 --> 21:10.720
 what the best feeding windows are.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.220
 There's absolutely no information in that context.

21:13.220 --> 21:18.220
 You talk to 10 nutritionists or academics or trainers

21:18.620 --> 21:20.620
 or individuals about what healthy eating is,

21:20.620 --> 21:22.900
 and you are going to get vastly different answers.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.820
 And that's one of the reasons why I believe that

21:25.820 --> 21:28.060
 the internet, in particular social media,

21:28.060 --> 21:30.780
 are so filled with contradictory opinions.

21:30.780 --> 21:35.620
 But the calories in versus calories burned formula

21:35.620 --> 21:39.460
 is the more or less holy foundation of all things

21:39.460 --> 21:41.420
 about nutrition, eating, and weight.

21:41.420 --> 21:43.540
 And as we transition today into the discussion

21:43.540 --> 21:47.060
 about eating disorders, I'd like you to keep this in mind

21:47.060 --> 21:49.600
 because for the treatment of eating disorders,

21:49.600 --> 21:52.720
 it doesn't matter what psychological

21:52.720 --> 21:56.560
 or early trauma-based effects led to the eating disorder

21:56.560 --> 21:59.540
 if the person isn't adjusting their feeding behavior

21:59.540 --> 22:02.020
 in a way that is going to ameliorate the symptoms

22:02.020 --> 22:04.860
 of that disorder, which is ultimately the goal.

22:04.860 --> 22:07.400
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

22:07.400 --> 22:10.320
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.500
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

22:12.500 --> 22:15.180
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

22:15.180 --> 22:18.100
 and science-related tools to the general public.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.180
 In keeping with that theme,

22:19.180 --> 22:22.160
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.700
 Our first sponsor is Belcampo.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.440
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

22:27.440 --> 22:29.220
 that raises organic, grass-fed,

22:29.220 --> 22:32.460
 and finished certified humane meats.

22:32.460 --> 22:33.560
 I don't eat a lot of meat,

22:33.560 --> 22:36.220
 but I eat meat about once a day.

22:36.220 --> 22:39.420
 That means a small piece of steak or chicken, et cetera,

22:39.420 --> 22:40.900
 and usually a salad.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.900
 I usually do that for breakfast or for lunch.

22:43.900 --> 22:44.820
 And then in the evening,

22:44.820 --> 22:47.380
 I tend to follow a more or less vegetarian diet.

22:47.380 --> 22:50.380
 I tend to eat pastas and vegetables and things of that sort.

22:51.980 --> 22:53.120
 While I don't eat a lot of meat,

22:53.120 --> 22:54.460
 it's important that the meat that I eat

22:54.460 --> 22:57.100
 be of very high quality and that I am certain

22:57.100 --> 22:59.780
 that the animals were raised and treated humanely

22:59.780 --> 23:02.060
 up until the point of slaughter.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.140
 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

23:04.140 --> 23:06.180
 and seasonal grasses their entire lives,

23:06.180 --> 23:07.780
 resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients

23:07.780 --> 23:08.820
 and healthy fats.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.640
 It also results in healthy, happy cows.

23:12.780 --> 23:16.020
 I often talk about how important omega-3 fatty acids are.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.780
 They've been shown to be important for regulating mood,

23:18.780 --> 23:21.900
 for the microbiome, for restricting inflammation in the brain

23:21.900 --> 23:23.260
 and elsewhere in the body.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.220
 Belcampo's meats are known to be high in omega-3s.

23:26.220 --> 23:29.340
 And given that the meat is grass-fed and grass-finished,

23:29.340 --> 23:32.740
 that combines all the features of the nutrition

23:32.740 --> 23:35.540
 and the animal wellbeing that I want to see

23:35.540 --> 23:37.940
 for any meat that I ingest.

23:37.940 --> 23:39.180
 If you'd like to try Belcampo,

23:39.180 --> 23:41.220
 first-time customers can get 20% off

23:50.580 --> 23:53.580
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.000
 Headspace is a meditation app

23:55.000 --> 23:57.300
 that's backed by 25 published studies

23:57.300 --> 24:01.300
 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.660
 I've been meditating for a very long time,

24:03.660 --> 24:05.940
 although I admit I meditate on and off,

24:05.940 --> 24:07.860
 meaning I'll go a few weeks or months,

24:07.860 --> 24:10.960
 meditating regularly, and then I tend to stop.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.940
 A few years ago, I got into a regular meditation practice

24:13.940 --> 24:17.300
 because I started using Headspace's meditation app.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.100
 The thing I really like about their meditation app

24:19.100 --> 24:21.340
 is it has meditations of different durations.

24:21.340 --> 24:22.780
 So sometimes I'll just meditate

24:22.780 --> 24:24.240
 for three minutes or five minutes,

24:24.240 --> 24:27.060
 or ideally I'm doing two 20-minute sessions per day,

24:27.060 --> 24:29.300
 but I confess I don't always manage that.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.220
 But they have a ton of different meditations

24:31.220 --> 24:33.180
 on the Headspace app that allow you

24:33.180 --> 24:35.060
 to tailor your meditation practice

24:35.060 --> 24:37.060
 to your particular schedule.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.140
 And there are now a plethora of studies

24:39.140 --> 24:42.500
 showing the benefits of a regular meditation practice.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.620
 If you want to try Headspace,

24:43.620 --> 24:46.900
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

24:46.900 --> 24:49.340
 And if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial

24:49.340 --> 24:51.660
 with Headspace's full library of meditations.

24:51.660 --> 24:52.500
 You get them all.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.660
 That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.140
 So again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com

24:57.140 --> 24:59.060
 slash special offer.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.900
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.140
 Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink,

25:05.140 --> 25:08.420
 and it's one that I've been drinking since 2012.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.260
 The reason I started drinking Athletic Greens

25:10.260 --> 25:12.340
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

25:12.340 --> 25:14.980
 is that it really helps me cover all of my nutritional bases

25:14.980 --> 25:18.500
 with respect to vitamins and minerals and probiotics.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.420
 And we now know that a healthy gut microbiome

25:21.420 --> 25:23.740
 is supported by probiotics.

25:23.740 --> 25:25.680
 And for me, Athletic Greens is the best way

25:25.680 --> 25:27.180
 to get those probiotics.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.760
 I also ingest some fermented foods,

25:28.760 --> 25:30.380
 but by ingesting Athletic Greens,

25:30.380 --> 25:32.860
 I'm certain to get all the things I need.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.300
 And also I just feel better when I drink it.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.120
 I genuinely feel like I have more energy

25:37.120 --> 25:38.440
 and I just feel better.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.260
 And I happen to really like the way it tastes.

25:40.260 --> 25:42.180
 I mix mine with some water and some lemon juice.

25:42.180 --> 25:43.120
 And in doing that,

25:43.120 --> 25:45.900
 I'm certain to get all of my nutritional bases covered

25:45.900 --> 25:48.500
 and the probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome,

25:48.500 --> 25:50.140
 which is important for mood,

25:50.140 --> 25:52.860
 regulating inflammation and so on.

25:52.860 --> 25:54.260
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

25:54.260 --> 25:57.180
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.660
 And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

25:59.660 --> 26:01.180
 They'll give you five free travel packs

26:01.180 --> 26:02.980
 in addition to your Athletic Greens order.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.580
 Those travel packs make it really easy

26:04.580 --> 26:07.020
 to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road,

26:07.020 --> 26:08.580
 in the car, on the plane, et cetera.

26:08.580 --> 26:11.860
 And they will give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.

26:11.860 --> 26:14.640
 Vitamin D3 and K2 have been shown to be important

26:14.640 --> 26:18.020
 for blood lipid profiles, for metabolism,

26:18.020 --> 26:22.380
 and a whole bunch of other metabolic and neural processes.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.020
 So go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

26:25.020 --> 26:27.060
 to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

26:27.060 --> 26:29.640
 and the year supply of D3 and K2.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.860
 So let's talk about eating disorders.

26:31.860 --> 26:34.100
 And as we do that, I want to emphasize again,

26:34.100 --> 26:37.360
 that nobody can really define what healthy eating is

26:37.360 --> 26:38.620
 with a single protocol.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.320
 However, there is some general agreement

26:40.320 --> 26:44.320
 about what unhealthy and disordered eating is.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.780
 There are clear criteria in the psychiatric

26:46.780 --> 26:50.020
 and psychological communities to define things

26:50.020 --> 26:53.040
 like anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder,

26:53.040 --> 26:54.780
 all of which we will talk about.

26:54.780 --> 26:55.980
 But as we have that discussion,

26:55.980 --> 26:59.540
 I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis

26:59.540 --> 27:03.900
 can be both a terrific, but also a very precarious thing.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.060
 We talked about this a little bit

27:05.060 --> 27:07.060
 in the episode about depression.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.780
 There's always a temptation,

27:08.780 --> 27:11.780
 as one learns about the symptomology of a given disorder,

27:11.780 --> 27:14.160
 doesn't really matter what the disorder is,

27:14.160 --> 27:16.200
 to ask the question, well, do I have that?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.900
 Does so-and-so that I know have that?

27:17.900 --> 27:21.500
 Ah, I see this sort of behavior or that pattern of thinking

27:21.500 --> 27:23.200
 in that individual.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.140
 It's tempting to diagnose them and or ourselves

27:26.140 --> 27:28.440
 as either having or not having a particular disorder.

27:28.440 --> 27:32.920
 However, diagnoses really need to be carried out

27:32.920 --> 27:36.320
 by people who are trained in that particular field

27:36.320 --> 27:37.660
 and that have deep expertise

27:37.660 --> 27:39.780
 in recognizing the symptomology,

27:39.780 --> 27:42.100
 including some of the more subtle symptomology

27:42.100 --> 27:43.340
 of eating disorders.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.680
 So if any of the symptoms resonate with you,

27:46.680 --> 27:49.740
 by way of you thinking that you have

27:49.740 --> 27:51.760
 this particular disorder or someone that you know

27:51.760 --> 27:54.960
 has a disorder, I would take that seriously,

27:54.960 --> 27:56.720
 but I would take that information

27:56.720 --> 27:58.760
 to a qualified healthcare professional

27:58.760 --> 28:01.500
 that could diagnose or rule out

28:01.500 --> 28:03.400
 any of these possible disorders.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.680
 I say that not to protect us, but to protect you,

28:06.680 --> 28:08.320
 because information is valuable.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.040
 And I do believe that knowledge of knowledge

28:10.040 --> 28:12.800
 can be very valuable in navigating any topic

28:12.800 --> 28:15.880
 and improving our thoughts and behaviors around that topic.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.120
 But one doesn't want to,

28:18.120 --> 28:21.100
 or I should say one shouldn't start to self-diagnose

28:21.100 --> 28:23.080
 simply on the basis of information

28:23.080 --> 28:24.940
 without running that through the filter

28:24.940 --> 28:26.720
 of a qualified professional.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.940
 So what is an eating disorder?

28:28.940 --> 28:31.600
 Well, we have to take a step back

28:31.600 --> 28:35.640
 and confess to the fact that every society, every culture,

28:35.640 --> 28:37.660
 every family and every individual

28:37.660 --> 28:40.320
 has a different relationship to food.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.740
 Eating disorders, however, have particular criteria

28:43.740 --> 28:46.160
 that allow us to define them

28:46.160 --> 28:49.180
 and to think about different modes of treatment

28:49.180 --> 28:52.880
 as it relates to the particular symptoms,

28:52.880 --> 28:54.440
 in particular the psychological

28:54.440 --> 28:56.400
 and biological symptoms of those disorders.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.060
 Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended.

28:59.060 --> 29:00.900
 What are the major eating disorders?

29:02.040 --> 29:06.600
 Anorexia nervosa, most commonly referred to as anorexia,

29:06.600 --> 29:09.680
 is perhaps the most prevalent

29:09.680 --> 29:13.080
 and the most dangerous of all eating disorders.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.080
 In fact, anorexia is the most dangerous

29:16.080 --> 29:19.520
 psychiatric disorder of all, even more than depression.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.620
 The probability of death for untreated anorexia

29:24.620 --> 29:26.240
 is very high.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.880
 And sadly, the prevalence of anorexia is very high.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.500
 So what is anorexia and how prevalent is it?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.660
 Anorexia, if you look it up online

29:35.660 --> 29:37.540
 or you talk to a qualified professional,

29:37.540 --> 29:39.560
 is essentially a failure to eat enough

29:39.560 --> 29:41.440
 to maintain a healthy weight.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.560
 You can see all sorts of very troubling symptoms

29:45.560 --> 29:48.380
 of somebody who's been anorexic for some period of time.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.260
 A general loss of muscle mass

29:52.260 --> 29:55.560
 because they're ingesting fewer calories than they burn.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.420
 Muscle is very metabolically active.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.840
 They tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.020
 They will have a low heart rate.

30:02.020 --> 30:06.640
 This is the body and brain's attempt to lower energy output.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.240
 They will have low blood pressure.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.900
 They will sometimes have symptoms like fainting.

30:10.900 --> 30:15.160
 They will have sometimes even hair growth on the face,

30:15.160 --> 30:16.800
 something called lanugo,

30:16.800 --> 30:20.560
 which is essentially the body's attempt to insulate the body

30:20.560 --> 30:23.680
 because of loss of body heat when you're that thin.

30:24.820 --> 30:28.120
 Loss of bone density, osteoporosis,

30:28.120 --> 30:31.840
 loss of periods in girls and women

30:31.840 --> 30:36.840
 and all sorts of disrupted gut and immune functions.

30:36.840 --> 30:41.000
 So there are just tons of terrible symptoms of anorexia

30:41.000 --> 30:45.720
 that really placed the anorexic into a very risky state,

30:45.720 --> 30:49.760
 which is why mortality from anorexia gone untreated

30:49.760 --> 30:51.800
 is extremely high.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.660
 Now, one of the misconceptions about anorexia

30:55.660 --> 31:00.040
 is that it stems from an overemphasis on perfectionism

31:00.040 --> 31:04.280
 or that because of all the images in social media

31:04.280 --> 31:07.720
 and in advertising of extremely thin and fit

31:07.720 --> 31:09.240
 or muscular people,

31:09.240 --> 31:11.760
 that individuals are looking at themselves

31:11.760 --> 31:14.040
 and comparing themselves to those images

31:14.040 --> 31:15.600
 and thinking that they don't match up

31:15.600 --> 31:17.360
 in developing anorexia.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.120
 That turns out to not be the case.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.880
 If you look at the prevalence or the rates of anorexia

31:24.880 --> 31:27.240
 in the last 10 years or 20 years,

31:27.240 --> 31:30.720
 and you compare that to when anorexia was first identified,

31:30.720 --> 31:34.080
 which was in the 1600s and perhaps even earlier,

31:34.080 --> 31:38.520
 what you find is that rates of anorexia are not going up.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.480
 So this idea that the images that we're being bombarded with

31:41.480 --> 31:45.160
 are causing anorexia doesn't seem to be true.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.120
 Now, that is not to say that the images

31:47.120 --> 31:49.940
 that we in particular young people are being bombarded with

31:49.940 --> 31:52.920
 are healthy for their psychological state of mind,

31:52.920 --> 31:55.840
 but classically defined anorexia

31:55.840 --> 31:58.400
 has existed as essentially the same prevalence

31:59.500 --> 32:03.640
 for the last 100, 200, 300 and 400 years,

32:03.640 --> 32:06.560
 which is incredible and really speaks to the likelihood

32:06.560 --> 32:09.420
 that there's a strong biological contribution

32:09.420 --> 32:12.080
 to what we call anorexia nervosa.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.820
 Anorexia nervosa is extremely common.

32:14.820 --> 32:19.760
 It's anywhere from one to 2% of women.

32:19.760 --> 32:24.020
 And the typical onset is in adolescence, close to puberty,

32:24.020 --> 32:26.920
 but it can show up later in life as well.

32:26.920 --> 32:30.840
 In fact, the identification and diagnosis of anorexia

32:30.840 --> 32:33.440
 tends to be in the early 20s,

32:33.440 --> 32:36.520
 but if you look back at the history of those individuals,

32:36.520 --> 32:38.840
 there were typically signs of anorexia

32:38.840 --> 32:40.600
 that stem back into their early teens

32:40.600 --> 32:42.560
 or maybe even before that.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.400
 Now, of course, men can be anorexic as well,

32:45.400 --> 32:47.880
 but anorexia nervosa does seem to occur

32:47.880 --> 32:51.960
 at 10 times the rate in women and young girls

32:51.960 --> 32:55.060
 than it does in men and young boys.

32:55.060 --> 32:58.440
 So while there does seem to be more of a prevalence

32:58.440 --> 33:02.640
 of anorexia in boys and young men these days,

33:02.640 --> 33:06.460
 that's probably due to better diagnosis and detection

33:06.460 --> 33:09.620
 than it is to some sort of societal shift

33:09.620 --> 33:12.040
 related to imagery, et cetera.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.120
 Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia

33:14.120 --> 33:17.520
 and some of the images that are present in media

33:17.520 --> 33:19.840
 and social media and how those are impacting

33:19.840 --> 33:21.080
 other forms of eating disorders.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.420
 But when you look at anorexia nervosa,

33:23.420 --> 33:26.320
 this failure to maintain weight, even to healthy levels

33:26.320 --> 33:29.160
 and often drops in weight that are very dangerous

33:29.160 --> 33:33.520
 or even deadly, that has existed for a very long time

33:33.520 --> 33:37.240
 and seems to be somewhat hardwired into the biology

33:37.240 --> 33:38.560
 of individuals that suffer from it.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.240
 Now, when I say hardwired, that doesn't mean

33:40.240 --> 33:43.300
 that it can't be treated or cured and indeed it can.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.600
 Bulimia, which is defined as binge eating or overeating,

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
 let me explain what that is.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.120
 Binge eating is consuming vast amounts of calories

33:52.120 --> 33:53.520
 in a short period of time.

33:53.520 --> 33:58.140
 Overeating can be ingesting more calories than one needs,

33:58.140 --> 34:00.320
 but over an extended period of time,

34:00.320 --> 34:05.000
 both can exist, of course, but bulimia is also very common.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.440
 It's more common in young girls and in women

34:08.440 --> 34:11.220
 than it is in young boys and in men,

34:11.220 --> 34:13.520
 but it is present in both sexes.

34:14.900 --> 34:18.920
 Bulimia and rates of bulimia might be increasing.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.360
 That's sort of an interesting finding.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.280
 It's not quite clear whether or not it's existed

34:24.280 --> 34:26.240
 in its same form for a long period of time

34:26.240 --> 34:29.040
 or whether or not there are new forms that are evolving

34:29.040 --> 34:30.760
 or showing up.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.920
 We're going to drill into bulimia and what it actually is

34:33.920 --> 34:35.280
 and what it represents.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.640
 But one thing I want to be clear about,

34:37.640 --> 34:41.240
 just as the perfectionist mindset has been associated

34:41.240 --> 34:44.260
 with anorexia, and it turns out that's not the case.

34:45.400 --> 34:49.240
 It can be, but it's not always associated with anorexia.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.940
 There was the idea that bulimia is associated

34:52.940 --> 34:54.980
 with early trauma in childhood,

34:54.980 --> 34:56.480
 in particular sexual trauma.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.680
 And while that can be the case,

34:58.680 --> 35:01.640
 there's no direct correlation between the two.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.160
 Now, obviously psychological phenomena and trauma

35:05.160 --> 35:07.480
 can have a profound impact on the way that the brain

35:07.480 --> 35:10.400
 wires up and the way that people approach food

35:10.400 --> 35:12.440
 and other types of behaviors.

35:12.440 --> 35:16.240
 But the sort of classic idea was that all anorexics

35:16.240 --> 35:18.760
 are perfectionists, they want to perform well,

35:18.760 --> 35:20.880
 it's all about control and autonomy,

35:20.880 --> 35:23.720
 and bulimics are kind of dysregulated and acting out

35:23.720 --> 35:25.740
 against some early sexual trauma.

35:25.740 --> 35:29.840
 Those stereotypes of the psychological framework

35:29.840 --> 35:33.180
 of anorexics and bulimics doesn't hold up

35:33.180 --> 35:34.340
 when you look at the data.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.960
 Many meta analyses have been done,

35:36.960 --> 35:38.720
 it just simply is not the case.

35:38.720 --> 35:42.160
 And in both instances, both anorexia and bulimia,

35:42.160 --> 35:44.680
 there are clear biological underpinnings

35:44.680 --> 35:48.260
 to what's driving the undereating or the overeating.

35:48.260 --> 35:51.280
 So we're going to talk about the biology of undereating

35:51.280 --> 35:54.680
 and overeating and appropriate levels of eating.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.000
 And by doing that, we will start to identify

35:57.000 --> 36:00.380
 some of the mechanisms that serve as entry points

36:00.380 --> 36:03.940
 for the treatment of both anorexia and bulimia.

36:03.940 --> 36:06.080
 And as some of you are probably aware,

36:07.160 --> 36:09.600
 anorexia and bulimia can be comorbid,

36:09.600 --> 36:12.080
 they can exist with one another.

36:12.080 --> 36:16.160
 There are anorexics who will binge and then purge

36:16.160 --> 36:19.580
 in order to maintain that unhealthily low weight.

36:19.580 --> 36:24.040
 There are bulimics who fit the psychological criteria

36:24.040 --> 36:26.780
 of anorexia, and so there's a lot of overlap

36:26.780 --> 36:28.420
 between those two categories.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.740
 Now let's talk about the categorization for a second

36:30.740 --> 36:33.620
 and why the categorization has led to now

36:33.620 --> 36:35.580
 a bunch of other eating disorders

36:35.580 --> 36:38.240
 as defined by the psychiatric community.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.860
 One of the classic symptoms of anorexia

36:40.860 --> 36:44.360
 is a loss of menstrual cycles, loss of periods.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.580
 And the reason for that is when the body is undernourished,

36:47.580 --> 36:51.980
 the body fat stores send signals to the brain

36:51.980 --> 36:54.400
 to inform that the body is undernourished

36:54.400 --> 36:57.160
 or they turn off the signals that say,

36:57.160 --> 36:58.840
 look, there are enough body fat cells out here

36:58.840 --> 37:01.100
 to support healthy metabolism,

37:01.100 --> 37:04.660
 and therefore let's shut down ovulation.

37:04.660 --> 37:08.220
 Literally signals sent from the fat and muscle to the brain

37:08.220 --> 37:10.460
 and the brain, the hypothalamus and pituitary

37:10.460 --> 37:13.740
 will send signals down to the ovaries

37:13.740 --> 37:16.620
 or they will turn off the signals heading to the ovaries

37:16.620 --> 37:20.020
 to deploy eggs, the maturation of eggs

37:20.020 --> 37:21.720
 in the follicle, et cetera.

37:21.720 --> 37:26.720
 So there are instances in which people have anorexia

37:26.720 --> 37:29.420
 or have bulimia, but are still maintaining

37:29.420 --> 37:31.900
 healthy menstrual cycles, or at least menstrual cycles.

37:31.900 --> 37:36.860
 And that has led to a whole set of other categorizations

37:36.860 --> 37:38.860
 of eating disorders like binge eating disorder,

37:38.860 --> 37:41.040
 where there tends to be a lot of overeating,

37:41.040 --> 37:45.380
 but not the purging, or categorizations of anorexia

37:45.380 --> 37:47.060
 in which people are underfeeding,

37:47.060 --> 37:48.980
 but they are not losing their periods.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.780
 And so these have a number of different names and acronyms.

37:51.780 --> 37:54.460
 Some of them include things like EDNOS.

37:54.460 --> 37:58.960
 EDNOS is eating disorder, not otherwise specified.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.180
 So that's a sub-categorization or OSFEDS.

38:02.180 --> 38:06.420
 So OSFEDS is other specified feeding or eating disorder.

38:06.420 --> 38:08.740
 So right now, if you were to look online

38:08.740 --> 38:10.900
 or you're looking into the psychiatric

38:10.900 --> 38:12.020
 and psychological textbooks,

38:12.020 --> 38:14.220
 what you would find is that there's a huge constellation

38:14.220 --> 38:15.060
 of eating disorders.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.600
 Today, we're mainly going to talk about anorexia,

38:17.600 --> 38:21.380
 bulimia, binge eating disorder, and body dysmorphia.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.940
 You can even find eating disorders like pica,

38:23.940 --> 38:27.220
 where people actually ingest things like dirt

38:27.220 --> 38:30.760
 or rocks or metal because they have a genuine appetite

38:30.760 --> 38:31.600
 for those things.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.340
 I certainly do not recommend sampling

38:34.340 --> 38:36.780
 any of those non-food items as foods.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.580
 It is incredibly dangerous.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.480
 People often poison themselves.

38:40.480 --> 38:44.020
 They often can cause structural blockages.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.600
 Some people have died from those sorts of things,

38:46.600 --> 38:50.520
 but nonetheless, there are aspects of our brain and biology

38:50.520 --> 38:53.180
 that when disrupted can lead to very bizarre types

38:53.180 --> 38:54.660
 of eating behavior.

38:54.660 --> 38:58.180
 Sometimes pica is caused by malnutrition, but not always.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.880
 And so today we're going to focus

38:59.880 --> 39:01.980
 on the most prevalent eating disorders,

39:01.980 --> 39:04.480
 but we are going to build up toward that understanding

39:04.480 --> 39:08.580
 by looking at what healthy metabolism and eating

39:08.580 --> 39:10.980
 and satiety and hunger looks like.

39:10.980 --> 39:13.340
 Because one, I realized that not everyone out there

39:13.340 --> 39:14.660
 has an eating disorder.

39:14.660 --> 39:18.220
 And two, I want people to understand this relationship

39:18.220 --> 39:20.820
 between how they think,

39:20.820 --> 39:23.040
 the decisions they take about what they eat,

39:23.040 --> 39:26.600
 and how the body and the brain at subconscious levels

39:26.600 --> 39:28.980
 are driving some of these behaviors,

39:28.980 --> 39:30.320
 healthy or otherwise,

39:30.320 --> 39:32.180
 because I do think that it can lead us

39:32.180 --> 39:34.780
 to a better understanding of what healthy eating is

39:34.780 --> 39:38.460
 for most of us, and to increase compassion

39:38.460 --> 39:41.100
 and hopefully even increased improvement

39:41.100 --> 39:43.400
 in treatment of eating disorders for those

39:43.400 --> 39:45.100
 that are suffering from them.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.180
 So what is hunger and what is satiety?

39:47.180 --> 39:49.100
 Satiety, of course, being sated

39:49.100 --> 39:51.340
 or feeling like we've had enough food.

39:53.420 --> 39:55.740
 I want to remind people of the basic mechanisms

39:55.740 --> 39:57.640
 by which the brain and body communicate.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.040
 This is vitally important, not just for this discussion,

40:00.040 --> 40:03.420
 but for any discussion about how we think,

40:03.420 --> 40:05.620
 how we behave, how we feel.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.280
 The body is communicating two types of information

40:08.280 --> 40:10.680
 to the brain on a regular basis,

40:10.680 --> 40:13.060
 but in particular around feeding.

40:13.060 --> 40:14.380
 And those two types of information

40:14.380 --> 40:18.820
 are mechanical information and chemical information.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.340
 What do I mean by mechanical information?

40:20.340 --> 40:24.180
 Well, if you take a deep breath and you hold your breath,

40:24.180 --> 40:25.560
 what you'll find is that you can hold your breath

40:25.560 --> 40:28.020
 a lot longer than if you exhale all your air

40:28.020 --> 40:29.780
 and you hold your breath with lungs empty.

40:29.780 --> 40:32.860
 And the reason is not because when your lungs are full,

40:32.860 --> 40:34.260
 you have enough oxygen,

40:34.260 --> 40:35.780
 and therefore you can hold your breath.

40:35.780 --> 40:38.260
 It's because when your lungs are full,

40:38.260 --> 40:41.180
 a particular class of neurons called baroreceptors

40:41.180 --> 40:43.500
 send information to the brain

40:43.500 --> 40:45.340
 and say there's pressure in the lungs.

40:45.340 --> 40:47.680
 And that means that there's probably oxygen in here.

40:47.680 --> 40:51.460
 And so the trigger to breathe is actually suppressed.

40:51.460 --> 40:52.720
 When your lungs are empty,

40:52.720 --> 40:55.180
 even if you have plenty of oxygen in your system,

40:55.180 --> 40:57.580
 those baroreceptors send a different signal to the brain,

40:57.580 --> 41:00.580
 which is there's no oxygen in here and you should breathe.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.420
 And so the impulse to breathe comes earlier.

41:02.420 --> 41:05.340
 Likewise, when your stomach is full,

41:05.340 --> 41:06.700
 it sends signals to your brain

41:06.700 --> 41:09.660
 that are purely based on this mechanical fullness.

41:09.660 --> 41:14.020
 Has nothing to do with nutrients that says I'm full

41:14.020 --> 41:16.680
 and therefore don't be as hungry.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.460
 Don't motivate to find or ingest food.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.260
 Whereas when our gut is empty,

41:21.260 --> 41:23.220
 even if we have plenty of nutrients

41:23.220 --> 41:25.260
 or plenty of body fat stores,

41:25.260 --> 41:27.860
 we tend to focus on food a bit more.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.660
 So volume and mechanical influences have a profound effect

41:31.660 --> 41:35.620
 on how we think and what we consider doing or not doing.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.820
 Likewise, chemical effects.

41:37.820 --> 41:39.180
 When we ingest food,

41:39.180 --> 41:41.940
 our so-called blood sugar or blood glucose levels go up.

41:41.940 --> 41:44.460
 That information is signaled to the brain

41:44.460 --> 41:48.940
 via neuronal pathways and hormonal pathways.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.420
 And in particular, there are neurons within our gut

41:51.420 --> 41:53.240
 that signal to areas of our brainstem

41:53.240 --> 41:56.140
 that are involved in satiety in our sense of having enough

41:56.140 --> 41:58.380
 that there's food in our system.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.480
 So that's chemical information.

42:00.480 --> 42:05.600
 So how are hunger and feeding and satiety regulated

42:05.600 --> 42:07.840
 by way of mechanical and chemical signaling?

42:08.740 --> 42:12.780
 You have, I have, we all have neurons in our hypothalamus

42:12.780 --> 42:17.580
 that trigger eating and neurons that trigger cessation

42:17.580 --> 42:18.760
 or stopping of eating.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.180
 We have an accelerator on eating and we have a break.

42:21.180 --> 42:23.780
 And I covered all of this in a lot of detail

42:23.780 --> 42:26.700
 in the episode on feeding and metabolism and hunger.

42:26.700 --> 42:29.740
 So if you want a lot more detail, see that episode.

42:29.740 --> 42:32.060
 But right now, I'm just going to give you the top contour

42:32.060 --> 42:34.060
 of how all that works.

42:34.060 --> 42:36.100
 Your hypothalamus is an area of your forebrain,

42:36.100 --> 42:37.920
 which tells you it's in the front,

42:37.920 --> 42:39.360
 but it's at the base of your forebrain.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.380
 So it's more or less above the roof of your mouth.

42:41.380 --> 42:44.380
 The hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds of neurons,

42:44.380 --> 42:48.020
 including neurons that stimulate sexual activity and desire,

42:48.020 --> 42:51.820
 regulate your body temperature and control appetite

42:51.820 --> 42:55.320
 and ceasing of eating and appetite.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.220
 There are two types of neurons within a particular area

42:59.220 --> 43:01.200
 of your hypothalamus that are relevant here.

43:01.200 --> 43:05.720
 There are the so-called POMC neurons, okay?

43:05.720 --> 43:10.460
 Pro opioid melanocortin neurons that tend to act

43:10.460 --> 43:15.040
 as more of a break on appetite by way of another hormone

43:15.040 --> 43:16.780
 called melanocyte stimulating hormone.

43:16.780 --> 43:19.420
 And not so incidentally, when you're getting a lot

43:19.420 --> 43:21.260
 of sunlight and you're viewing a lot of sunlight,

43:21.260 --> 43:23.140
 that system is ramped up.

43:23.140 --> 43:25.940
 This is why appetite is lower in the summer months

43:25.940 --> 43:27.420
 than it is in the winter months.

43:27.420 --> 43:30.820
 This is true in animals, and this is true in humans.

43:30.820 --> 43:34.020
 And you have a class of neurons called the AGRP neurons.

43:34.020 --> 43:37.700
 The AGRP neurons are the ones that stimulate feeding

43:37.700 --> 43:41.460
 and they create a sort of anxiety or excitement about food.

43:41.460 --> 43:45.500
 It can be positive anxiety or it can be negative anxiety.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.460
 What do I mean by that?

43:46.460 --> 43:49.860
 Well, have you ever seen kids heading in to get ice cream?

43:49.860 --> 43:51.180
 They're absolutely excited.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.900
 You see people getting ready to sit down

43:52.900 --> 43:54.400
 and eat a big meal.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.500
 They're excited to eat.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.300
 Sometimes that's due to social factors,

43:57.300 --> 43:59.620
 but they have an increase in overall levels

43:59.620 --> 44:01.180
 of autonomic arousal.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.620
 And depending on the context,

44:02.620 --> 44:04.260
 they can feel excited or anxious,

44:04.260 --> 44:06.260
 but it is a ramping up of energy.

44:06.260 --> 44:09.500
 These AGRP neurons are what caused that.

44:09.500 --> 44:12.420
 In fact, so much so that if you eliminate

44:12.420 --> 44:14.700
 or kill these neurons, which has been done

44:14.700 --> 44:16.820
 in experimental mouse models in the laboratory,

44:16.820 --> 44:18.760
 but also there are humans that have lesions

44:18.760 --> 44:22.020
 or neurotoxic effects on these AGRP neurons.

44:22.020 --> 44:24.080
 And what you find is that they don't want to eat.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.460
 They essentially become anorexic,

44:26.460 --> 44:28.280
 meaning they don't want to ingest food.

44:28.280 --> 44:31.220
 They have no appetite for food whatsoever.

44:31.220 --> 44:33.400
 Now that's not exactly what anorexia is,

44:33.400 --> 44:35.860
 but these AGRP neurons are like an accelerator

44:35.860 --> 44:36.900
 on wanting to eat.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.600
 Whereas if you stimulate these AGRP neurons

44:39.600 --> 44:42.340
 or in humans that have say a small tumor

44:42.340 --> 44:44.920
 near these AGRP neurons, they become hyperphagic.

44:44.920 --> 44:47.060
 They will eat to the point of bursting.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.780
 Both animals and humans that have elevated levels

44:49.780 --> 44:52.660
 of these AGRP neurons are anxious.

44:52.660 --> 44:55.260
 They want to eat and they will ingest food

44:55.260 --> 44:57.420
 to the point where they override those mechanical

44:57.420 --> 44:58.760
 and chemical signals in the body.

44:58.760 --> 45:01.180
 And I know it sounds horrible and it is horrible.

45:01.180 --> 45:04.100
 They will eat until the point that they burst.

45:04.100 --> 45:07.260
 Now there are signals coming back from the body

45:07.260 --> 45:09.160
 to inform the brain about presence

45:09.160 --> 45:11.100
 of different levels of nutrients.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.420
 And that generally comes from three sources.

45:13.420 --> 45:16.720
 First of all, is body fat.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.060
 The more body fat we have,

45:18.060 --> 45:20.440
 the more we secrete a hormone called leptin,

45:20.440 --> 45:23.320
 L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin from body fat.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.140
 Leptin goes to the brain and suppresses appetite.

45:27.140 --> 45:29.860
 This is a body to brain signaling mechanism

45:29.860 --> 45:32.580
 that says, look, I've had enough.

45:32.580 --> 45:36.480
 Not incidentally, leptin signaling is disrupted

45:36.480 --> 45:39.680
 in people that have bulimia and obesity

45:39.680 --> 45:42.460
 and certain forms of binge eating disorder.

45:42.460 --> 45:44.680
 So that system is disrupted.

45:44.680 --> 45:47.440
 I've had enough signal or there's enough body fat here

45:47.440 --> 45:49.760
 such that you don't need to eat more.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.880
 Right here, I'm sort of in the voice of the body fat

45:51.880 --> 45:52.920
 trying to talk to the brain.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.080
 That signal, that dialogue is mixed up or messed up.

45:56.080 --> 45:58.340
 In some cases, it's absent entirely.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.780
 So the body fat is signaling to the brain

46:00.780 --> 46:02.780
 about how much reserve you have.

46:02.780 --> 46:05.120
 It's sort of like a savings account for energy

46:05.120 --> 46:06.520
 because that's what body fat is.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.480
 You got lipids in there and through lipolysis,

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
 they can be metabolized.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.000
 If you're interested in that process,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.240
 both how to increase it and just generally how it works,

46:15.240 --> 46:18.480
 you can see the episode on the science of fat loss.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.480
 The body fat is doing something else really interesting

46:20.480 --> 46:22.840
 that relates to anorexia.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.800
 When there's sufficient levels of body fat

46:24.800 --> 46:27.240
 and leptin circulating in the blood

46:27.240 --> 46:29.920
 and that leptin signal gets to the brain,

46:29.920 --> 46:32.480
 the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland

46:32.480 --> 46:37.440
 register that signal and in a completely subconscious way,

46:37.440 --> 46:41.880
 trigger the deployment of eggs in females

46:41.880 --> 46:44.900
 and the production of sperm in males.

46:44.900 --> 46:47.140
 So when body fat stores are very low,

46:47.140 --> 46:49.200
 the reason why periods shut off

46:49.200 --> 46:52.200
 or sperm production is reduced or even shut off

46:52.200 --> 46:54.000
 is because there's not enough leptin

46:54.000 --> 46:57.680
 getting to the hypothalamus and to the pituitary

46:57.680 --> 47:00.460
 and they shut off the signals, the hormones,

47:00.460 --> 47:02.120
 things like gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

47:02.120 --> 47:04.360
 luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,

47:04.360 --> 47:05.840
 all these hormones that you don't have to remember

47:05.840 --> 47:07.980
 the names of if you don't want to,

47:07.980 --> 47:10.280
 that travel to the ovary or to the testes

47:10.280 --> 47:12.820
 and cause the ovary and testes to ovulate

47:12.820 --> 47:15.560
 or to produce more sperm.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.420
 So the reason why anorexics stop having periods,

47:19.280 --> 47:20.600
 why they stop cycling,

47:20.600 --> 47:22.780
 is because there isn't sufficient leptin

47:22.780 --> 47:24.000
 in the bloodstream.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.520
 Now, there have been attempts to give leptin to anorexics

47:28.520 --> 47:30.580
 because leptin has been sequenced

47:30.580 --> 47:32.640
 and the peptide has been synthesized

47:32.640 --> 47:35.320
 and so you can inject leptin into people.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.480
 There are studies where they've done that.

47:37.480 --> 47:40.420
 When that happens, it does not tend

47:40.420 --> 47:42.840
 to alleviate the anorexia.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.800
 It does not cause people to start eating again

47:44.800 --> 47:46.080
 and that actually makes sense

47:46.080 --> 47:48.680
 because leptin is also a way of shutting off

47:48.680 --> 47:51.360
 the hunger signals saying, it's the body fat's way

47:51.360 --> 47:52.860
 of saying, hey, there's a lot of body fat here

47:52.860 --> 47:54.120
 or there's sufficient body fat.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.120
 There doesn't even have to be a lot,

47:56.120 --> 47:57.980
 but it has in some cases been shown

47:57.980 --> 48:02.440
 to rescue the menstrual cycling in some anorexics, okay?

48:02.440 --> 48:04.760
 So body fat is signaling to the brain.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.300
 The gut is signaling to the brain.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.760
 There are neurons in your gut

48:07.760 --> 48:10.780
 that are primarily responding to,

48:10.780 --> 48:12.360
 meaning they fire electrical signals

48:12.360 --> 48:14.440
 when there are sufficient fatty acids

48:14.440 --> 48:16.640
 coming from fats you ingest,

48:16.640 --> 48:18.960
 amino acids coming from proteins you ingest

48:18.960 --> 48:21.920
 and sugars coming from carbohydrates and sugars,

48:21.920 --> 48:23.960
 things like fructose, glucose, et cetera.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.400
 Those signals are being sent from the fat

48:27.400 --> 48:29.960
 and from the gut up to the brain.

48:29.960 --> 48:34.340
 And therefore your body has multiple signals

48:34.340 --> 48:38.480
 of directing you toward eating more or eating less.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.080
 So you've got two categories of neurons,

48:40.080 --> 48:41.840
 one that acts as an accelerator,

48:41.840 --> 48:44.340
 the AGRP neuron saying eat, eat

48:44.340 --> 48:46.740
 and gets you excited to eat.

48:46.740 --> 48:48.500
 And then you have a category of neurons,

48:48.500 --> 48:51.840
 the PMOC neurons that are suppressing hunger.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.960
 They're acting like a break.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.800
 And the body is informing the brain all the time

48:55.800 --> 48:57.200
 about the status of the body

48:57.200 --> 48:59.780
 and whether or not it needs more food or not.

48:59.780 --> 49:02.400
 So you might ask, why is it that people who are overweight

49:02.400 --> 49:03.940
 and have a lot of body fat,

49:03.940 --> 49:05.700
 why they would continue to eat a lot?

49:05.700 --> 49:08.040
 Well, past a certain threshold of body fat,

49:08.040 --> 49:08.880
 that's when you start getting

49:08.880 --> 49:10.880
 into these so-called metabolic disorders

49:10.880 --> 49:13.360
 where blood glucose metabolism is disrupted,

49:13.360 --> 49:15.200
 leptin signaling is disrupted.

49:15.200 --> 49:16.600
 And there are all sorts of changes

49:16.600 --> 49:20.640
 on both the brain side and the body end of things

49:20.640 --> 49:23.160
 such that they're hungry despite the fact

49:23.160 --> 49:26.200
 that the body has plenty of energy on reserve.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.680
 Okay.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.000
 That I think is sufficient to explain

49:30.000 --> 49:32.360
 that the basics of hunger and satiety

49:32.360 --> 49:33.960
 and a kind of a biological mechanism.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.380
 And the important thing again to remember

49:35.380 --> 49:37.660
 is that they're mechanical and chemical signals

49:37.660 --> 49:40.000
 that come from fullness or absence of fullness.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.880
 They come from the presence of glucose in the blood

49:41.880 --> 49:43.920
 or the absence of glucose in the blood.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.360
 When you haven't eaten for a long time,

49:45.360 --> 49:49.640
 glucagon levels go up for instance, GLP-1 levels go up

49:49.640 --> 49:52.160
 and those will drive you to seek out food and want food.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.760
 And then there are these signals that are coming

49:53.760 --> 49:56.000
 from body fat and from neurons in the gut.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.760
 So there's a lot of convergence signal, lot of pathways.

49:58.760 --> 50:01.080
 I don't offer you all those pathways to confuse you.

50:01.080 --> 50:05.360
 I offer you those pathways to clarify the extent

50:05.360 --> 50:08.200
 to which something as simple as eating

50:08.200 --> 50:11.540
 or the decision to not eat is complicated.

50:11.540 --> 50:14.400
 We've perhaps heard, or I've certainly heard that,

50:14.400 --> 50:16.560
 oh, you know, it takes about 20 minutes

50:16.560 --> 50:18.440
 for satiety to set in, you know,

50:18.440 --> 50:20.320
 so you should eat slowly that you won't realize

50:20.320 --> 50:22.480
 that you're full until about 20 minutes.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.800
 That's actually not true.

50:23.800 --> 50:24.920
 I don't know where that got started,

50:24.920 --> 50:26.860
 but we should probably all chew our food better

50:26.860 --> 50:28.240
 and eat more slowly,

50:28.240 --> 50:30.780
 be more mindful of what we're eating, et cetera.

50:30.780 --> 50:34.200
 So in anticipation of this episode,

50:34.200 --> 50:36.520
 I consulted extensively with a colleague of mine

50:36.520 --> 50:38.400
 at Stanford, who sadly for us

50:38.400 --> 50:40.600
 is going off to University of Pennsylvania.

50:40.600 --> 50:44.180
 So our loss is University of Pennsylvania's win.

50:44.180 --> 50:46.120
 His name is Dr. Casey Halpern.

50:46.120 --> 50:49.800
 He's a MD, medical doctor and neurosurgeon

50:49.800 --> 50:52.260
 and a PhD who studies binge eating disorder

50:52.260 --> 50:54.080
 and other types of eating disorders

50:54.080 --> 50:55.800
 and how they arise in the brain.

50:55.800 --> 50:58.600
 And he's developed some really pioneering treatments

50:58.600 --> 51:00.080
 for them.

51:00.080 --> 51:01.280
 We'll talk more about his work

51:01.280 --> 51:03.080
 a little bit later in the episode,

51:03.080 --> 51:08.000
 but we got to the discussion of why a body

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
 that has sufficient energy levels

51:10.000 --> 51:12.820
 would desire to eat more at all.

51:12.820 --> 51:15.360
 And this is not just the case for binge eating disorder

51:15.360 --> 51:17.760
 or for bulimia, but why that would be the case.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.520
 You know, this is primitive biology

51:19.520 --> 51:21.180
 that evolved over many tens,

51:21.180 --> 51:22.540
 if not hundreds of thousands of years,

51:22.540 --> 51:24.320
 you see it in mice, you see it in humans,

51:24.320 --> 51:27.340
 very similar types of pathways and effects.

51:27.340 --> 51:29.760
 How is it that human beings

51:29.760 --> 51:31.920
 who have plenty of fat on reserve

51:31.920 --> 51:34.700
 and plenty of glycogen in their liver, et cetera,

51:34.700 --> 51:36.240
 in other words, plenty of energy,

51:36.240 --> 51:39.240
 why they would be hungry, why they would eat at all?

51:39.240 --> 51:41.920
 It seems like that just shouldn't happen.

51:41.920 --> 51:46.440
 And he had a very important and I think clear

51:46.440 --> 51:49.700
 and intuitive way of framing up all this stuff

51:49.700 --> 51:51.480
 around eating and motivated behaviors

51:51.480 --> 51:53.200
 and how they can go awry,

51:53.200 --> 51:55.600
 not just in eating disorders, but in all of us.

51:56.880 --> 52:01.880
 Basically what he said was from an evolutionary standpoint,

52:02.560 --> 52:06.640
 it makes sense that we should eat as often as we can,

52:06.640 --> 52:10.280
 as much as we can, and as fast as we can.

52:10.280 --> 52:11.520
 Well, that sounds crazy.

52:11.520 --> 52:16.320
 I was told to eat not too often, not too much,

52:16.320 --> 52:18.780
 and to eat slowly and chew my food.

52:18.780 --> 52:21.960
 But as Dr. Halperin pointed out,

52:21.960 --> 52:24.600
 there are circuits in the brain to reward eating often,

52:24.600 --> 52:29.360
 eating fast and cramming as much food into you as possible.

52:29.360 --> 52:32.180
 Because from a purely evolutionary standpoint,

52:33.340 --> 52:36.440
 food was scarce and seeking food was dangerous,

52:36.440 --> 52:38.960
 whether or not it was from animal sources or not.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.840
 And it's always been competitive.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.180
 For those of you that grew up in families

52:43.180 --> 52:45.440
 with a lot of siblings, this may resonate with you.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.340
 I had just one sibling.

52:47.340 --> 52:48.680
 We were competitive about certain things,

52:48.680 --> 52:50.420
 but typically not competitive about food.

52:50.420 --> 52:52.740
 But I had friends that had a lot of siblings.

52:52.740 --> 52:55.580
 It was really interesting to see how food was served up

52:55.580 --> 52:59.940
 and how it was taken in those households.

52:59.940 --> 53:01.200
 It was like food would hit the table

53:01.200 --> 53:05.520
 and it was just an absolute war for portions.

53:05.520 --> 53:07.480
 And who got what and how much

53:07.480 --> 53:10.080
 and who got a slightly bigger piece of cake, et cetera,

53:10.080 --> 53:14.000
 turned out to be a frequent happening in these meals

53:14.000 --> 53:15.580
 and at these birthday parties.

53:15.580 --> 53:17.740
 Whereas the only children, perhaps,

53:17.740 --> 53:20.300
 were used to having more food presented to them

53:20.300 --> 53:23.000
 without having to compete with other members of the species.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.340
 Every animal, including humans,

53:25.340 --> 53:28.700
 has a hardwired circuit that we were born with

53:28.700 --> 53:32.160
 that pays attention to how much food is available,

53:32.160 --> 53:33.480
 how much we are getting now

53:33.480 --> 53:36.280
 and how much we are likely to get in the future.

53:36.280 --> 53:38.480
 And without going down the rabbit hole

53:38.480 --> 53:42.360
 of arcuate nucleus biology,

53:42.360 --> 53:45.320
 in two sentences, you have a hypothalamic area

53:45.320 --> 53:46.960
 called the arcuate nucleus.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.240
 It's a fascinating area.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.360
 It's actually the area that houses these PMOC neurons

53:51.360 --> 53:52.440
 and these other types of neurons

53:52.440 --> 53:55.240
 that regulate hunger and satiety.

53:55.240 --> 53:58.240
 And these neurons in the arcuate nucleus

53:58.240 --> 54:02.240
 start getting active when we see food and think about food.

54:02.240 --> 54:05.960
 They drive hunger and they drive hunger

54:05.960 --> 54:08.980
 in a way that's responsive to what the food looks like,

54:08.980 --> 54:10.480
 what it smells like,

54:10.480 --> 54:14.120
 but also our prior history of interactions with that food.

54:14.120 --> 54:17.340
 And it takes into account social context,

54:17.340 --> 54:19.560
 whether or not we are going to get

54:19.560 --> 54:20.760
 the whole pizza to ourselves

54:20.760 --> 54:23.240
 or whether or not there are going to be others

54:23.240 --> 54:24.760
 that we are going to have to compete with.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.400
 So there are a lot of signals that this arcuate nucleus

54:27.400 --> 54:29.620
 in your brain are paying attention to.

54:29.620 --> 54:31.480
 So Dr. Halperin pointed out

54:31.480 --> 54:33.920
 that you actually have an accelerator

54:33.920 --> 54:36.920
 that increases your level of awareness and anxiety

54:36.920 --> 54:39.360
 and sort of constricts your field of view

54:39.360 --> 54:42.160
 and all your senses anytime you interact with food

54:42.160 --> 54:44.200
 and is driving a primitive reflex

54:44.200 --> 54:48.120
 to ingest as much food as you can, as quickly as you can,

54:48.120 --> 54:49.680
 and then move on from there

54:49.680 --> 54:52.120
 and presumably to do the same elsewhere.

54:52.120 --> 54:56.360
 So that changed the way that I think about eating behavior

54:56.360 --> 54:58.160
 and eating disorders.

54:58.160 --> 55:00.200
 In fact, we could think about eating disorders

55:00.200 --> 55:03.760
 like bulimia as an unmasking of that mechanism

55:03.760 --> 55:05.520
 without the so-called top-down control,

55:05.520 --> 55:09.320
 without the mechanisms that we use to regulate our behavior.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.400
 And indeed bulimia and binge eating disorder

55:12.400 --> 55:15.760
 are closely associated with impulsivity

55:15.760 --> 55:18.800
 and with impulsive behaviors of other kinds,

55:18.800 --> 55:21.780
 something that we also will discuss more.

55:21.780 --> 55:22.680
 What's the pathway?

55:22.680 --> 55:23.520
 How does this work?

55:23.520 --> 55:26.240
 What is Dr. Halperin and his colleagues doing

55:26.240 --> 55:28.900
 in order to try and treat things like binge eating disorder?

55:28.900 --> 55:33.900
 Well, you can frame all of behavior,

55:34.020 --> 55:36.920
 good decision-making and bad decision-making

55:36.920 --> 55:39.760
 in a pretty simple box diagram model.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.720
 And I realized that many of you are listening to this,

55:41.720 --> 55:44.100
 not watching this, and there is no diagram to look at.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.040
 I'll just explain it

55:45.040 --> 55:47.380
 so that you can conceptualize it in your mind.

55:48.580 --> 55:52.560
 We have knowledge of what we should do in one box, okay?

55:52.560 --> 55:53.480
 We should eat that.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.440
 We shouldn't eat that.

55:54.440 --> 55:55.360
 We should wait for dinner.

55:55.360 --> 55:57.480
 We shouldn't wait for dinner.

55:57.480 --> 56:02.000
 And then we have what we actually do in another box, okay?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.540
 Now this is true for all behaviors.

56:03.540 --> 56:06.080
 We should say something or we want to say something,

56:06.080 --> 56:06.960
 but we don't.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.000
 We shouldn't say something, but we do anyway.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.960
 That's the knowledge, the kind of looping in your head.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.080
 I should do my homework.

56:13.080 --> 56:14.400
 I should go for a run.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.840
 I shouldn't do this right now.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.500
 I shouldn't be on social media.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.280
 All those kinds of shoulds and shouldn'ts

56:19.280 --> 56:21.460
 that are circulating in your head, that's one box.

56:21.460 --> 56:23.720
 Then there's what you actually do, the behavior,

56:23.720 --> 56:25.520
 whether or not you suppress the behavior,

56:25.520 --> 56:27.800
 you turn off your phone and you go read a book

56:27.800 --> 56:30.480
 or you go to sleep or whether or not you stay up all night

56:30.480 --> 56:33.480
 or you stay up for another hour, even five minutes.

56:33.480 --> 56:37.080
 In between those two boxes are two intervening forces.

56:37.080 --> 56:39.940
 And those intervening forces are critically important.

56:39.940 --> 56:43.280
 Those intervening forces are homeostatic processes

56:44.160 --> 56:46.760
 called by some processes, same thing.

56:46.760 --> 56:51.700
 Homeostatic processes that regulate the balance

56:51.700 --> 56:54.200
 of different systems in your body, hot and cold,

56:54.200 --> 56:58.760
 awake or asleep, dopamine and the desire to pursue things,

56:58.760 --> 57:02.260
 serotonin and the desire to just relax and chill.

57:02.260 --> 57:06.780
 So homeostatic processes and reward systems.

57:06.780 --> 57:08.800
 And as we now move into discussion

57:08.800 --> 57:11.600
 about anorexia and bulimia specifically,

57:11.600 --> 57:15.900
 what you'll see is that anorexia and bulimia

57:15.900 --> 57:18.840
 are not a breaking of the mindset

57:18.840 --> 57:21.920
 of what one should do or shouldn't do.

57:21.920 --> 57:26.280
 It's a disruption of these homeostatic and reward processes

57:26.280 --> 57:29.160
 such that decision-making is completely disrupted

57:29.160 --> 57:31.200
 and in many cases is not available

57:31.200 --> 57:33.080
 to the anorexic or bulimic.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.480
 Now, I don't want to be abstract here.

57:34.480 --> 57:38.780
 What I'm saying is that the person who starves themselves

57:38.780 --> 57:40.320
 to the point where they might die

57:40.320 --> 57:42.880
 and in some cases sadly do die,

57:42.880 --> 57:46.060
 they can know perfectly well that their behavior

57:46.060 --> 57:50.500
 is leading to bad outcomes and possibly even death.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.600
 And yet they are not able to intervene

57:53.600 --> 57:55.920
 unless they get particular clinical help

57:56.760 --> 57:59.800
 because the homeostatic processes,

57:59.800 --> 58:03.500
 the signals from the body and brain that say you need food,

58:03.500 --> 58:05.880
 those aren't registering in the same way

58:05.880 --> 58:08.120
 that they are for other individuals.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.400
 And for the bulimic or the person that suffers

58:10.400 --> 58:12.080
 from binge eating disorder,

58:12.080 --> 58:14.880
 they don't necessarily want to eat that food.

58:14.880 --> 58:17.320
 They simply cannot help it.

58:17.320 --> 58:18.880
 It's like a reflex for them

58:18.880 --> 58:22.060
 because the homeostatic processes

58:22.060 --> 58:24.700
 and the reward processes associated with food

58:24.700 --> 58:26.840
 are such that they can't intervene

58:26.840 --> 58:30.000
 between the should do X, Y, or Z,

58:30.000 --> 58:31.280
 or shouldn't do X, Y, or Z

58:31.280 --> 58:33.060
 and what their actual behavior is.

58:33.060 --> 58:37.160
 Now, this isn't just a biological mechanistic explanation

58:37.160 --> 58:39.620
 for what could have been summarized in two sentences.

58:39.620 --> 58:42.280
 What this is is a roadmap

58:42.280 --> 58:45.360
 of where interventions can really make a difference.

58:45.360 --> 58:48.360
 So as we talk about different drug-based interventions

58:48.360 --> 58:51.760
 or behavioral interventions or social interventions,

58:52.680 --> 58:54.720
 I'd like you to think about whether or not

58:54.720 --> 58:58.320
 those interventions are breaking into

58:58.320 --> 59:01.040
 or tapping into this box of the thinking,

59:01.040 --> 59:03.620
 the sort of pattern of thinking around food,

59:03.620 --> 59:04.660
 whether or not it's the behavior,

59:04.660 --> 59:07.280
 the actual ingestion or the restriction of food,

59:07.280 --> 59:09.940
 or whether or not it's tapping into the homeostatic process,

59:09.940 --> 59:11.560
 the balance of energy systems

59:11.560 --> 59:14.100
 and kind of getting enough but not too much,

59:14.100 --> 59:16.920
 or it's tapping into the reward system.

59:16.920 --> 59:20.040
 And just as a little teaser of where we're headed,

59:20.040 --> 59:22.360
 what you'll find based on the data,

59:22.360 --> 59:24.840
 clinical data experiments done very carefully

59:24.840 --> 59:27.020
 and very well by excellent groups,

59:27.020 --> 59:29.460
 what you'll find is that anorexics

59:29.460 --> 59:32.740
 have a sort of switch that's been flipped

59:32.740 --> 59:34.400
 such that their decision-making

59:34.400 --> 59:36.120
 is actually pretty darn good.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.760
 It might even be better than yours

59:37.760 --> 59:40.960
 in terms of evaluating food nutritional content,

59:40.960 --> 59:43.200
 but their habits are disrupted.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.640
 So they're not even consciously aware of the fact

59:45.640 --> 59:47.680
 that they're making terrible and in some cases,

59:47.680 --> 59:49.520
 very dangerous food choices.

59:49.520 --> 59:54.280
 It turns out that habits and the way that we build

59:54.280 --> 59:56.760
 and break and rebuild new habits

59:56.760 --> 59:59.520
 is one of the most effective treatments for anorexia.

59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.060
 So now let's talk about anorexia,

1:00:01.060 --> 1:00:03.200
 this failure to consume enough energy

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:06.200
 such that the individual is at risk of death.

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:09.080
 And if not death, then severe metabolic disorders,

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.420
 lack of bone density, et cetera.

1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:13.600
 As I mentioned earlier,

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:17.800
 anorexia and things that almost certainly were

1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:19.680
 and are anorexia have been described as early

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:22.240
 as the 1600s and maybe even earlier.

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:24.280
 There are some records from the saints,

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:28.160
 from the 1400s of people that refuse to ingest food.

1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:32.120
 Another common myth is that anorexia

1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:37.120
 is only the sort of thing that you see in rich societies.

1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:40.000
 These are spoiled children with so much food

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.600
 that they decided they're only going to focus

1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:44.960
 on how slim they are, how they look in bathing suits,

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:47.320
 et cetera, not true.

1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:50.560
 A careful analysis through medical epidemiology

1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:53.580
 has shown that you find anorexia even in cultures

1:00:53.580 --> 1:00:56.240
 and societies where food is scarce.

1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:58.700
 So that really speaks to biological mechanism.

1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:02.200
 Now it's hard to unveil in societies where food is scarce

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:05.340
 because a lot of people are starving and hungry,

1:01:05.340 --> 1:01:09.720
 but there are individuals that choose still to avoid food

1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:12.440
 and seem to have some sort of reward mechanism

1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:15.580
 that rewards them or makes them feel better

1:01:15.580 --> 1:01:16.720
 if they don't eat,

1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:20.800
 despite the fact that their body is severely depleted

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:22.000
 of nutrients.

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.800
 So that's very interesting and points again

1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:26.560
 to some disruption in some biological mechanism.

1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:29.620
 Now, I want to make sure that I'm emphasizing

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:32.520
 that I'm not in favor of people,

1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:35.540
 in particular young children, adolescents and teenagers,

1:01:35.540 --> 1:01:39.040
 being bombarded with unrealistic imagery about bodies.

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:41.720
 But the idea that that's the cause of,

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:44.080
 or is amplifying anorexia,

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:46.800
 the data just don't seem to support that.

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:51.200
 Anorexia in its classic sense requires

1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:54.880
 that there be an endocrine, meaning a hormonal disruption,

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.500
 menstrual abnormalities, lack of sperm production

1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:59.920
 or low testosterone in males,

1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:03.520
 in order to meet the classification for anorexia.

1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:04.560
 But as I mentioned earlier,

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:09.280
 there are now nuanced and new classifications of anorexia

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:11.760
 that even for individuals that still menstruate

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:14.320
 or that maintain sperm production,

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:16.680
 that anorexia can still be considered

1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:19.240
 a clinically diagnosable disorder.

1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:22.600
 Now, typically anorexia starts in adolescence

1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:23.600
 right around puberty.

1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.400
 Let's take a look at what puberty is.

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.140
 Puberty at a very broad level is the most significant

1:02:30.140 --> 1:02:32.920
 and dramatic developmental step anyone goes through

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:33.840
 in their lifespan.

1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:36.940
 The body changes, the brain changes, perceptions change,

1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:39.360
 one's own self perception changes.

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:43.600
 And most of those changes are driven by changes in circuitry

1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:45.080
 within the hypothalamus.

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:46.980
 So neurons that are controlling the production

1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:49.520
 of the so-called sex steroid hormones,

1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:52.060
 things like testosterone, estrogen, and related hormones,

1:02:52.060 --> 1:02:53.400
 prolactin, et cetera,

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:56.360
 those are all changing at very rapid rates.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:00.060
 Anorexia tends to show up around this time

1:03:00.060 --> 1:03:03.860
 in a subset of individuals who on the face of it

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:06.080
 seem to find food aversive.

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:08.240
 Now, the purely psychological theory of this

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:10.520
 is that they are fighting for autonomy.

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:11.800
 They want control.

1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.520
 Puberty is also a time in which children and parents

1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:17.200
 are in a tug of war over control.

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:20.440
 You were once a small child being told when to go to bed,

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:21.400
 sent to your room.

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:23.820
 Now you're a child that can talk back and say,

1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:26.160
 I don't want to, or I refuse to.

1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:29.160
 And that happens a lot in various households

1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:30.860
 as I'm sure you're familiar with.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.160
 Adolescence and puberty is also

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:37.440
 when girls start menstruating typically,

1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:41.840
 or boys develop deeper voice,

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.420
 they start producing sperm, et cetera.

1:03:44.420 --> 1:03:45.760
 So there are a lot of bodily changes

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:47.480
 that also drive perceptual changes

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:49.520
 and perceptual changes that drive bodily changes.

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:54.520
 And it is a dramatic shift for a young girl or boy

1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:56.240
 that doesn't nourish themselves

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:57.360
 sufficiently during that period.

1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:00.360
 There are a number of downstream negative effects.

1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:01.580
 I'll list out some of them.

1:04:01.580 --> 1:04:04.280
 These are just a subset of the effects.

1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:07.820
 Hypogonadism, that's the lack of sperm production

1:04:07.820 --> 1:04:10.060
 or healthy egg production.

1:04:10.060 --> 1:04:14.720
 There is amenorrhea, which is the lack of menstrual cycling.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:17.660
 Okay, so a failure to have a menstrual cycle.

1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:19.000
 Reduced insulin secretion.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.880
 Insulin is this hormone that's released

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:23.320
 in order to help shuttle glucose

1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.640
 into various tissues for energy utilization.

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.320
 That's down because energy levels are down so much.

1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:30.240
 One of the symptoms that's a little more cryptic

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:32.480
 and that has actually interesting implications

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:34.900
 for sake of the cholesterol hypothesis

1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:39.900
 is that anorexics who ingest very little food

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.920
 often have cosmically high levels of cholesterol,

1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:46.000
 including LDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol.

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.500
 You say, well, how could that possibly be it?

1:04:47.500 --> 1:04:50.820
 We were all told and continue to be told from many sources

1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:53.480
 that ingestion of dietary cholesterol

1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:55.920
 is what drives high levels of bodily cholesterol.

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:58.120
 Cholesterol is manufactured by the liver

1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:02.920
 and in anorexics who consume very little food,

1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:06.100
 they often have cosmically high levels of cholesterol,

1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:08.520
 which is one of the kind of wrinkles

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:11.540
 in the so-called dietary cholesterol hypothesis

1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:14.580
 that all of our cholesterol that we see on a blood panel

1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:16.360
 is due to what we eat.

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:19.580
 But the explanation for it is that under conditions

1:05:19.580 --> 1:05:21.220
 where there's not sufficient cholesterol

1:05:21.220 --> 1:05:23.360
 to synthesize the sex steroid hormones,

1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:24.960
 things like testosterone and estrogen,

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:27.080
 which are required in both males and females,

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:31.320
 those are made from cholesterol that the body,

1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:33.800
 the liver will start generating its own cholesterol

1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:37.520
 and will often overshoot the mark to a dramatic degree.

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:39.820
 So the blood lipid profiles in anorexics

1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:41.520
 are often very unhealthy,

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:44.800
 despite the fact that they're eating very little food.

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:47.000
 In addition, they tend to have elevated levels

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.560
 of things like vasopressin,

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:50.880
 which are hormones that regulate body temperature

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:54.120
 and salt and blood volume.

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:55.380
 They tend to have low blood pressure.

1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:56.360
 They can pass out.

1:05:56.360 --> 1:05:58.760
 I mentioned some of the other symptoms earlier.

1:05:59.900 --> 1:06:01.720
 In other words, there are a huge number

1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:03.080
 of terrible things happening.

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:04.480
 Thyroid levels are down.

1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:06.160
 Heart rates are down.

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:07.980
 If I'm painting a very bleak picture here,

1:06:07.980 --> 1:06:10.240
 it is indeed a bleak picture.

1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:13.240
 So we have to ask ourselves what can be done

1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:16.040
 for the anorexic, right?

1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:19.260
 Let's say it's a failure of the AGRP neurons

1:06:19.260 --> 1:06:21.960
 to stimulate appetite and feeding.

1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:24.200
 Let's say it's too much anxiety around food.

1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:27.160
 Let's say it's because of the way that food restriction

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:29.320
 was used for reward in the household, right?

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:30.160
 I'm making this up,

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:31.800
 but you can imagine a hypothetical scenario

1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:36.800
 where let's just say the mother of a particular individual

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:39.080
 is very vocal about her avoidance of food.

1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:40.260
 We've seen this before, right?

1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.280
 You've probably seen somebody who loves to cook

1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:43.700
 and prepare food, but then sits down

1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:44.540
 and doesn't seem to eat.

1:06:44.540 --> 1:06:47.320
 And they always seem to, in air quotes, have eaten earlier.

1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:48.640
 I ate while I cooked.

1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:49.900
 I ate while I cooked, right?

1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:52.800
 These people that you never actually see eating.

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:53.740
 We all know people like this.

1:06:53.740 --> 1:06:54.640
 Are they anorexic?

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:57.000
 Possibly, we don't know.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.920
 A child observes that kind of behavior.

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:01.200
 Maybe that individual is always being told

1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:04.160
 how beautiful they look or how wonderful or fit they look,

1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:06.560
 what incredible meals they produce.

1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:11.560
 And you could imagine a purely psychosocial set of events

1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:14.920
 that could lead a child to be anorexic.

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:16.880
 That doesn't seem to be the case,

1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:20.360
 at least not in terms of driving classic anorexia,

1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:25.180
 of really extreme deprivation of oneself from food.

1:07:25.180 --> 1:07:28.760
 However, there's a strong genetic component for anorexia.

1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:32.760
 So you could imagine a mild form of anorexia in a parent

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:37.680
 that is supported or exacerbated by praise

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:39.140
 so that the person feels good

1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:40.760
 from the praise they're getting,

1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:44.440
 that they want to be a low body weight for whatever reason,

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:46.800
 for aesthetic reasons, or for whatever reasons

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:48.440
 that happen to appeal to them.

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.400
 And the child has a genetic predisposition, right?

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:55.280
 We never think about genes in terms of controlling behavior,

1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:59.320
 genes bias probabilities for behavior, okay?

1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:01.740
 So you can have a gene for depression or for schizophrenia,

1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:04.240
 but it's not deterministic in the same way

1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:06.800
 that there are genes that determine your eye color

1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:10.280
 or your skin color or your hair color, okay?

1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:13.040
 So there's a genetic predisposition there.

1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:15.240
 And that genetic predisposition could exist

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:18.680
 such that if one is rewarded enough times

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.360
 for a particular behavior,

1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:24.020
 that behavior can start to ratchet in

1:08:24.020 --> 1:08:25.240
 to our neural circuitry

1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:27.080
 because behavior drives neural changes,

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:28.360
 so-called neuroplasticity.

1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:30.840
 And you could imagine that that child

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:33.200
 could develop a full-blown case of anorexia.

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:35.060
 And this is why I raised at the beginning

1:08:35.060 --> 1:08:38.360
 that no one really knows how to define healthy eating.

1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:40.860
 And so therefore we have to rely

1:08:40.860 --> 1:08:43.880
 on just identification of unhealthy behaviors.

1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:45.560
 But what do we point people to in terms of

1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:48.700
 what healthy replacement behaviors would be?

1:08:48.700 --> 1:08:51.280
 So rather than just look at anorexics and say,

1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:52.400
 they're not eating enough,

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:54.680
 and there's this huge array of terrible things

1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:57.240
 that they're doing to their body and they need to eat more,

1:08:57.240 --> 1:08:59.680
 we need to rescue them from themselves.

1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:00.920
 Let's look under the hood.

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:03.440
 Let's look at what's known about the neural circuitry

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:05.760
 and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors

1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:07.760
 of the neural circuitry is driving

1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:11.760
 in order to understand what they are truly suffering from

1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:13.120
 at the level of cause,

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.160
 not just symptoms.

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:15.440
 It's clear what they're suffering from

1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:17.040
 at the level of symptoms.

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:19.240
 Symptoms are how we diagnose.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.720
 I listed off a number of those things,

1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:24.620
 but let's look under the hood and try and identify

1:09:24.620 --> 1:09:27.400
 where one could intervene in theory

1:09:28.620 --> 1:09:31.280
 in order to try and rescue the anorexic

1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:34.400
 or help the anorexic rescue themselves.

1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:37.560
 Because it turns out that the answer,

1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.620
 or at least one of the answers of how to do that

1:09:39.620 --> 1:09:41.200
 is not intuitive at all,

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:43.480
 at least to me was very surprising.

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:46.080
 I would be remiss if I didn't start with the obvious,

1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:50.000
 which is, is there a chemical defect?

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.200
 Meaning, is there some disruption

1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:54.880
 in one of the major chemical systems in the brain

1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:57.240
 that makes anorexics anorexic?

1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:59.820
 And therefore, can we replace that chemical

1:09:59.820 --> 1:10:01.320
 or can we reduce some chemical

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.120
 and essentially eliminate anorexia?

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.640
 And the answer is not really sort of, maybe no.

1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:10.100
 Here's why.

1:10:10.100 --> 1:10:11.160
 There are a lot of different chemicals

1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:12.240
 in the brain and body,

1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:16.060
 but there are a category of chemicals

1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:17.520
 that are particularly important

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:19.280
 that if you've listened to this podcast before,

1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:20.800
 even if you haven't,

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:23.400
 are going to come up again and again and again.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.080
 And that is the category of chemicals

1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:27.720
 in the brain and body called the neuromodulators.

1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:30.520
 Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters

1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:32.480
 in the sense that neuromodulators modulate

1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:35.480
 or change the activity of brain areas and neural circuits.

1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:37.760
 You can think of them as microphones

1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:40.800
 that are held between particular sets of connections

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:42.960
 in the brain that make those connections in the brain

1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:46.800
 more likely to be active relative to others, okay?

1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:48.880
 They make them louder, so to speak.

1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:51.160
 There are many neuromodulators,

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:52.280
 but the ones that are important

1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:55.340
 for sake of today's discussion are the classic ones,

1:10:55.340 --> 1:10:59.000
 dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.280
 Let's focus on serotonin.

1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:03.120
 Serotonin is a neuromodulator

1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:06.820
 that tends to increase the activity

1:11:06.820 --> 1:11:08.540
 of certain neural circuits,

1:11:08.540 --> 1:11:11.560
 including within the hypothalamus, but also within the body,

1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:16.240
 that trigger a sense of satiety of having enough,

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:21.040
 enough food, enough warmth, enough social connection,

1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.000
 enough of any motivated goal or drive

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.760
 or any type of thing or behavior

1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:29.480
 that one would want more of.

1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:33.660
 Serotonin tends to make those circuits quiet down.

1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:37.380
 Now, there are many categories of drugs

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:40.560
 that emphasize the serotonergic circuitry,

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:42.660
 meaning they cause the release of

1:11:42.660 --> 1:11:45.320
 or the efficiency of serotonin in the brain and body,

1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:48.900
 things like Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things of that variety.

1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:54.220
 Those drugs have been used to some degree of success,

1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:58.440
 although not much, to treat things like anorexia nervosa.

1:11:58.440 --> 1:11:59.960
 That should make sense

1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:02.820
 because if these drugs increase serotonin,

1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:05.380
 if their general effect is to increase serotonin,

1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:08.740
 it will be to lower anxiety.

1:12:08.740 --> 1:12:10.220
 That sounds like a great thing.

1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:13.260
 A lot of anorexics are really anxious around food.

1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:15.060
 We'll talk about why.

1:12:15.060 --> 1:12:16.560
 Lowering anxiety you might think

1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:18.620
 would lead to ingestion of more food,

1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:21.000
 but that's not often what happens.

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.320
 Increasing serotonin by way of some drug regimen

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:27.620
 will tend to make one less hungry

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:31.300
 because with heightened levels of serotonin

1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:33.360
 in the blood and brain,

1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:35.780
 there isn't the desire to go seek out the things

1:12:35.780 --> 1:12:37.760
 that will raise serotonin on their own.

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:40.020
 Now, some anorexics do well

1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:43.440
 or benefit from these serotonergic drugs,

1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:45.780
 these drugs that increase the activity of these circuits

1:12:45.780 --> 1:12:47.140
 that lead to satiety.

1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:49.300
 But if you think about the major goal

1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:51.820
 of treating an anorexic,

1:12:51.820 --> 1:12:55.600
 it's to get them to have more hunger, more appetite.

1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:57.340
 So now I want to focus on some of the work

1:12:57.340 --> 1:12:59.380
 that's been done around the habits

1:12:59.380 --> 1:13:01.260
 and behaviors of anorexics.

1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:04.360
 Because those turned out to be ideal places

1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:05.320
 for intervention.

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:09.000
 The work I'm about to describe

1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.860
 was done by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues

1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:13.780
 at Columbia University in New York.

1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:15.200
 And there are other groups as well.

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:16.860
 Of course, they're doing this type of work.

1:13:16.860 --> 1:13:19.220
 But they did what I think are really

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:20.780
 some beautiful experiments

1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:24.100
 and some beautiful explorations of potential treatments

1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:28.260
 for anorexics that seem to have a quite high degree

1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:32.280
 of effectiveness when they are applied correctly.

1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:35.220
 First of all, there's a challenge in studying anorexia

1:13:35.220 --> 1:13:38.340
 because in anorexia what you're essentially studying

1:13:38.340 --> 1:13:40.360
 is the absence of a behavior.

1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:43.280
 It's very hard to study the absence of a behavior

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:45.460
 as opposed to a behavior.

1:13:45.460 --> 1:13:47.580
 So they did some experiments with anorexics

1:13:47.580 --> 1:13:51.460
 giving them a gallery of pictures of different foods

1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:55.360
 and allowing those anorexic patients to arrange those foods

1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:59.000
 according to preference about what they would select,

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.100
 about food nutrient content, about caloric content.

1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:07.100
 They essentially asked these anorexics to evaluate food.

1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:09.500
 And in doing so, they were able to identify

1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:12.140
 something that's very unique to anorexics

1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:15.260
 at the level of their perception of food.

1:14:15.260 --> 1:14:17.800
 What they found is that anorexics,

1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:20.360
 rather than being anxious in the presence of food

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:23.520
 and that anxiety driving and avoidance of food,

1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:27.020
 what they found is that anorexics have a hyper acuity,

1:14:27.020 --> 1:14:30.300
 a hyper awareness of the fat content of foods,

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:33.860
 almost to the point of being sort of fat content savants.

1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:36.800
 Now they don't necessarily know that they're doing this.

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.580
 They're not looking at an avocado and thinking,

1:14:38.580 --> 1:14:41.620
 okay, that's X number of grams of fat rather,

1:14:41.620 --> 1:14:44.460
 or looking at an apple and saying, okay, that has no fat.

1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:47.080
 They start to do this more or less reflexively.

1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:49.860
 Now it's a well-known symptom of anorexia,

1:14:49.860 --> 1:14:53.140
 especially young anorexics that they have

1:14:53.140 --> 1:14:56.060
 kind of an obsession with food, caloric contents,

1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:59.000
 macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.900
 and carbohydrate ratios.

1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:02.620
 They know caloric numbers,

1:15:02.620 --> 1:15:04.760
 but then they sort of pass that information

1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:07.280
 into a memory system in their brain

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:09.140
 that allows their interactions with food

1:15:09.140 --> 1:15:13.780
 to be very reflexive in a way that they are actively

1:15:13.780 --> 1:15:17.740
 avoiding high fat content foods, calorie rich foods,

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:20.820
 and defaulting towards very low calorie foods

1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:22.980
 if they have to eat.

1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:25.640
 Now, this might seem like an almost trivial result

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:26.480
 on the face of it.

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:27.580
 You think, okay, they don't like to eat.

1:15:27.580 --> 1:15:30.800
 When they do eat, they eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh.

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:34.980
 But it's the way in which they are doing this subconsciously

1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:36.380
 that they learn this information

1:15:36.380 --> 1:15:39.180
 and then they pass it off to a reflexive habit.

1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:41.940
 And that's very important because what that means

1:15:41.940 --> 1:15:44.900
 is that we need to look at what processes in the brain,

1:15:44.900 --> 1:15:45.740
 what brain areas,

1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:49.900
 what chemicals drive decision-making and knowledge.

1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:52.300
 And we also need to look at the areas of the brain

1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:57.300
 that drive habit formation and habit execution.

1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:59.660
 Because for any of you that have habits,

1:15:59.660 --> 1:16:01.420
 and that means all of you,

1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:04.420
 the hallmark feature of a habit is that it's reflexive.

1:16:04.420 --> 1:16:06.420
 You have a mosquito bite on your leg, you scratch it.

1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:07.840
 You didn't necessarily even think,

1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:09.560
 oh, I'm going to scratch that.

1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:13.060
 In fact, just to take a little bit of a moment of respite

1:16:13.060 --> 1:16:15.780
 and talk about habits in general,

1:16:15.780 --> 1:16:17.340
 there's a beautiful study that was done

1:16:17.340 --> 1:16:19.940
 out of Caltech University,

1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:23.060
 looking at the parking lot of where people park

1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:25.780
 in the morning without designated parking spots

1:16:25.780 --> 1:16:27.380
 and the trajectories that they use

1:16:27.380 --> 1:16:29.060
 to walk to their offices in the morning.

1:16:29.060 --> 1:16:30.860
 So they put cameras up on the roof of Caltech.

1:16:30.860 --> 1:16:33.260
 This is the kind of thing that the nerdy kids at Caltech do.

1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:35.300
 I think at Caltech, if you call someone a nerd is,

1:16:35.300 --> 1:16:36.120
 I think it's a compliment.

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:38.380
 So my apologies to the non-nerds at Caltech.

1:16:38.380 --> 1:16:39.780
 I think there's one or two of you.

1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:43.720
 And for the nerdy ones of you at Caltech, you're welcome.

1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:46.060
 They videotaped the behaviors of these faculty

1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:47.280
 and students and staff.

1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:51.000
 And what they found is that people follow trajectories

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.680
 from their car that are remarkably stereotyped.

1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:56.740
 First of all, they tend to park always in the same spot

1:16:56.740 --> 1:16:57.860
 if they can.

1:16:57.860 --> 1:16:59.280
 They tend to get out of their car, of course,

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:00.200
 because they're on the driver's side

1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:02.040
 or passenger side in the same place.

1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:03.940
 They turn and pivot their body

1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:05.580
 at approximately the same rate every day.

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:06.920
 They close the door.

1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:09.540
 They put their bag on their shoulder or across their chest

1:17:09.540 --> 1:17:11.320
 or however it is that they carry their briefcase

1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:12.160
 or whatever it is.

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:15.100
 And they follow trajectories onto campus

1:17:15.100 --> 1:17:17.540
 that are so stereotyped that you'd wonder

1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:19.500
 if you just trace line after line after line,

1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:23.680
 what you'd find is that every day is almost exactly the same

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:24.900
 and you do this too.

1:17:24.900 --> 1:17:27.900
 You don't realize it because if you're being videotaped

1:17:27.900 --> 1:17:28.740
 during this kind of behavior,

1:17:28.740 --> 1:17:30.080
 it's not being released to you,

1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:33.160
 but your behaviors are so stereotyped to the point

1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:35.400
 where if you were to see them laid out in front of you

1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:38.060
 in kind of diagrammatic format of the lines

1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:40.380
 and the trajectories that you follow throughout the day,

1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:42.260
 the lifting of your mug and how frequently

1:17:42.260 --> 1:17:45.900
 you drink each hour, you would be amazed

1:17:45.900 --> 1:17:47.760
 and probably a little bit scared

1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:51.280
 by how much of a robot we all are.

1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:54.680
 Now that robotic aspect of our neural circuitry is vital

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:56.960
 because it's what allows us to think about other things

1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:59.800
 and do other things and drive other behaviors.

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:03.040
 But the work of Dr. Steinglass and colleagues showed

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:05.260
 that in the case of the anorexic,

1:18:05.260 --> 1:18:07.960
 those habits are exactly the place

1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:09.960
 where things start to go awry

1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:12.720
 and that drive this very dysfunctional

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:16.120
 undereating behavior that sadly often leads to death

1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:18.560
 or certainly bad medical outcomes.

1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:21.620
 And it turns out that the brain areas associated

1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:24.240
 with habit formation and execution

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:26.600
 are the best point of intervention.

1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:28.880
 So what Dr. Steinglass and colleagues did

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:31.560
 is they took anorexics and they of course

1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:36.200
 had control groups and they put them in an FMRI scanner,

1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:39.040
 which are these brain scanners that allow you to evaluate

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:42.400
 which brain areas are active during particular tasks.

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:44.240
 And because when you're in one of those scanners,

1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:47.180
 you're actually, I've actually been in one of these things,

1:18:47.180 --> 1:18:50.440
 you're biting down on a bite bar and you're most of the time

1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:52.520
 in most all of these scanners, you're immobile.

1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:54.100
 So you're looking at things on a TV screen.

1:18:54.100 --> 1:18:56.960
 Sometimes you can press buttons to select choices

1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:00.640
 and so forth, but you can't really eat within those things.

1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:05.640
 What they found was that reward-based decision-making,

1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:08.900
 the drive to pursue a particular food

1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:12.440
 or the drive to perform a particular task,

1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:15.200
 which is a lot of what we do throughout our day,

1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:16.560
 that was controlled by a brain area

1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:19.160
 called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:20.780
 Let me simplify a little bit of this,

1:19:20.780 --> 1:19:23.480
 but I'm going to simplify it by giving you a little detail

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.000
 because it's the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.260
 And I believe in mechanism.

1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:29.680
 Mechanism is the way that you get true understanding

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:32.920
 and that you can then be very quick

1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:36.220
 and give overviews of things, but you need the mechanism.

1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:41.220
 So you have reflexes and you have neural processes

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:45.920
 that include what are called duration path

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:47.760
 and outcome type processes.

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:49.880
 A duration path outcome type process,

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:52.120
 we can shorten with DPO.

1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:57.120
 DPO is for all types of goal-related behaviors.

1:19:57.200 --> 1:19:58.160
 So for instance,

1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:00.720
 if you want to get a particular grade on an exam,

1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:02.560
 you want to learn something, you want to complete a workout,

1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:05.240
 you want to go to the grocery store and pick some stuff up

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:06.440
 and then head home.

1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:09.160
 You're going to think duration, how long do I have?

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.140
 Okay, do I have 45 minutes to get to the store?

1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:12.560
 How long does it take to get to the store?

1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:14.460
 Path, which way am I going to drive there?

1:20:14.460 --> 1:20:17.020
 Which way am I going to navigate through the grocery store?

1:20:17.020 --> 1:20:19.420
 Outcome, was I able to get in and get the items I need

1:20:19.420 --> 1:20:20.560
 and get home in time?

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:22.640
 Okay, DPO, duration path outcome.

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:24.680
 It's a very conscious process.

1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:27.040
 You tend to take into account different criteria

1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:28.600
 related to what's in,

1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:31.280
 what's preventing you from accomplishing what you want to do

1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:34.400
 and what's helping you or assisting you.

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:35.900
 So of course, as you get to the checkout line

1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:36.740
 in the grocery store,

1:20:36.740 --> 1:20:38.160
 you're going to select the shortest line, for instance.

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:39.360
 So that's all DPO stuff.

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:42.760
 It requires decision-making and it's reward-based.

1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:46.540
 You use these DPO type processes in the short term

1:20:46.540 --> 1:20:50.200
 to pick up groceries and pick a line at the grocery store

1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:53.160
 and decide which trajectory to take home.

1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:56.880
 And you use them for navigating long extended processes

1:20:56.880 --> 1:20:59.080
 in life, trying to get a degree or raise children

1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:03.680
 or get through a particularly challenging year, et cetera.

1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:07.240
 So duration path outcome and that entire process

1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:10.220
 relies on your forebrain, this prefrontal cortex.

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:13.840
 The prefrontal cortex is what allows you

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:15.500
 to take information from memory,

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:18.240
 combine it with information about what's happening

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:21.960
 in the present context, and then to direct your behavior,

1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:25.640
 your speech, et cetera, toward particular outcomes.

1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:29.240
 And if all that sounds like a mouthful, it is,

1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:30.960
 and it's very metabolically demanding.

1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:33.200
 Decision-making is metabolically demanding.

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:35.080
 It takes effort, okay?

1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:39.060
 Reflexes, on the other hand,

1:21:39.060 --> 1:21:41.520
 don't involve the prefrontal cortex in the same way.

1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:44.680
 Habits and reflexes, like once you know how to walk,

1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:45.800
 you get up and you walk.

1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:47.520
 You don't have to think about right foot, left foot,

1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:49.780
 right foot, left foot, you just do it.

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:51.800
 That doesn't rely on prefrontal cortex.

1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:53.840
 It's subconscious as it's sometimes called,

1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:56.840
 but basically you don't have to use the parts of the brain

1:21:56.840 --> 1:21:58.360
 that are involved in duration path

1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:01.200
 and outcome type analysis, okay?

1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:03.320
 So in this particular study,

1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:06.920
 they examined brain activity in anorexics

1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:09.920
 who are selecting different foods.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:10.880
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.520
 they have a hyperacuity or awareness

1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:16.700
 of which foods contain more or less calories

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.080
 than other foods and what the fat content

1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:21.440
 of particular foods is in particular, et cetera.

1:22:22.380 --> 1:22:25.260
 They're doing all this while in a scanner.

1:22:25.260 --> 1:22:28.280
 And then they look at what sorts of brain areas

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:31.680
 are active after that task is done.

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:33.640
 And what they found was really interesting.

1:22:33.640 --> 1:22:34.920
 What they found was that

1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:38.880
 the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, not surprisingly,

1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:41.480
 is involved in the decision-making

1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:44.100
 and the evaluation of this food,

1:22:44.100 --> 1:22:47.800
 which foods are going to be best to eat in this context,

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:50.280
 which foods are going to be appropriate

1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:53.200
 for at least that anorexics framework

1:22:53.200 --> 1:22:55.600
 about what's okay to eat and what's not okay to eat

1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:56.800
 and how much.

1:22:56.800 --> 1:23:00.420
 However, there are areas of the brain

1:23:00.420 --> 1:23:03.660
 that were active after that decision-making process.

1:23:03.660 --> 1:23:05.340
 And those are the brain areas

1:23:05.340 --> 1:23:07.860
 that turn out to drive the habit

1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:11.460
 of avoiding particular foods and approaching other foods.

1:23:11.460 --> 1:23:12.300
 And in that case,

1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:14.740
 it wasn't the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:18.220
 It was an area of the brain called the dorsolateral striatum.

1:23:18.220 --> 1:23:20.940
 Now, the striatum is a big area in the brain.

1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:23.020
 It's involved in a lot of different things.

1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:25.880
 It includes areas like the caudate and putatum.

1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:27.780
 And I just want to mention, as I throw out all these names,

1:23:27.780 --> 1:23:29.780
 you do not need to remember the names

1:23:29.780 --> 1:23:30.820
 of these different structures.

1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:32.180
 They're just there if you are interested

1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:33.920
 in that level of detail.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:35.500
 But basically you have a brain area,

1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:36.780
 and anorexics have a brain area

1:23:36.780 --> 1:23:38.180
 that's involved in evaluating

1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:39.720
 and decision-making around food.

1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:41.420
 And then another brain area

1:23:41.420 --> 1:23:44.920
 that's involved in the reflexive consumption

1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:45.900
 of particular foods

1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:48.980
 and the reflexive avoidance of other foods.

1:23:50.300 --> 1:23:51.660
 Now, if you remember way back,

1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:53.460
 the beginning of the episode,

1:23:53.460 --> 1:23:55.280
 I feel like it was a long time ago now,

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:57.940
 when we talked about how you have these sorts

1:23:57.940 --> 1:23:58.980
 of processes in the brain,

1:23:58.980 --> 1:24:01.580
 but there are always homeostatic

1:24:01.580 --> 1:24:05.340
 and reward systems influencing this kind of thing.

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:08.860
 Well, in the brain of the anorexic,

1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:12.720
 it turns out that the reward systems have been attached

1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:14.860
 to the execution of habits

1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:18.220
 in a way that is unhealthy for body weight.

1:24:18.220 --> 1:24:21.620
 But at least from a purely neural circuit perspective,

1:24:21.620 --> 1:24:24.060
 the reward is now given,

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:26.460
 this chemical reward in the brain is given

1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:28.580
 for avoiding particular foods

1:24:28.580 --> 1:24:33.380
 and only approaching these very low calorie, low fat foods.

1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:37.280
 So there really does seem to be a flip in the switch

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.460
 in the anorexic brain that rewards them internally.

1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:43.900
 They feel good when they avoid certain foods

1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:45.340
 and they approach others.

1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:47.800
 So it's not a deprivation based model

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.380
 where they are flagellating themselves

1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:53.080
 or masochistic or actively avoiding food

1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:55.540
 in order to punish themselves,

1:24:55.540 --> 1:24:56.380
 which is interesting

1:24:56.380 --> 1:24:59.080
 because a lot of psychological theories support that idea.

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:04.080
 Rather, once this transitions into a set of habits,

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:06.420
 they are actually getting a sense of reward.

1:25:06.420 --> 1:25:07.420
 They feel good,

1:25:07.420 --> 1:25:10.320
 presumably from the release of a different neuromodulator

1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:13.540
 called dopamine by approaching foods

1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:16.380
 that are low fat, low calorie content.

1:25:16.380 --> 1:25:19.220
 And so their whole brain circuitry is skewed

1:25:19.220 --> 1:25:21.020
 toward avoiding particular things

1:25:21.020 --> 1:25:23.240
 and they actually are rewarded for that

1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:24.600
 and they feel good.

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.740
 They feel better than if they were eating

1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:28.900
 in a healthy weight supporting way.

1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:33.420
 Now, the dorsolateral striatum is a structure

1:25:33.420 --> 1:25:36.060
 that we should think about in a little bit more depth.

1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:38.780
 It's part of a set of circuits that are involved

1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:40.820
 in what are called go, no-go tasks.

1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:41.780
 And I don't want to go into this

1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:42.900
 in a lot of detail right now

1:25:42.900 --> 1:25:46.260
 because it would take us too far down the rabbit hole

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:47.340
 of neural circuitry.

1:25:47.340 --> 1:25:51.880
 But basically in terms of behaviors,

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:55.340
 we both have DPO type behaviors.

1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:57.780
 So decision-making reward-based behaviors

1:25:57.780 --> 1:26:02.160
 and we have habits that we learn and we acquire

1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:04.460
 and then we just start to execute reflexively.

1:26:04.460 --> 1:26:07.700
 Things like walking, things like yawning when we're tired,

1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.520
 things like taking a particular route

1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.120
 through the parking lot, right?

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:12.620
 We learned that the first time we go

1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:14.420
 to a given parking lot and walk into a building.

1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.620
 But after that, we tend to follow the exact same trajectory.

1:26:16.620 --> 1:26:18.820
 It becomes very automatized.

1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:22.220
 It's just like we just do it without thinking.

1:26:22.220 --> 1:26:27.220
 Well, the go, no-go circuitry is another aspect

1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:30.640
 of our behavior where we both have to select behaviors

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:34.780
 to perform and we have to select behaviors to suppress.

1:26:34.780 --> 1:26:39.780
 And the anorexic brain seems to reward suppression

1:26:39.940 --> 1:26:43.060
 of one set of behaviors, ingestion of high calorie foods,

1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:47.980
 and to reward focus or even hyper-focus

1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:52.000
 and consumption of low fat, low calorie foods.

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.560
 So this homeostatic process that we learn about

1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:56.620
 from like high school onward that, oh,

1:26:56.620 --> 1:26:58.140
 everything in your body is designed

1:26:58.140 --> 1:26:59.680
 to keep everything in balance.

1:26:59.680 --> 1:27:01.240
 You stay awake for a certain amount of time,

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:02.220
 you want to sleep.

1:27:02.220 --> 1:27:03.140
 You don't eat for a while,

1:27:03.140 --> 1:27:05.020
 then you want to eat to maintain weight, right?

1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:07.100
 You eat too much, then you want to eat less.

1:27:07.100 --> 1:27:09.380
 Those systems are disrupted.

1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:12.320
 And so what's so beautiful about this work

1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:17.260
 from the Columbia group is that what it says is

1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:20.740
 the place to intervene has to be the habit.

1:27:20.740 --> 1:27:23.260
 This stuff has already passed through all the learning.

1:27:23.260 --> 1:27:25.220
 It's passed through all the reward systems.

1:27:25.220 --> 1:27:27.100
 It's clearly not being overrun

1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:28.900
 by the homeostatic processes of the body.

1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:30.400
 There's very little body fat.

1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:31.600
 There's no leptin.

1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:33.340
 Whatever neurons in the brain respond to leptin

1:27:33.340 --> 1:27:35.560
 are starved for leptin.

1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:36.560
 Periods have shut down,

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:39.040
 sperm production and testosterone is lowered.

1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:40.260
 Bone density is down.

1:27:40.260 --> 1:27:44.340
 Clearly this is overriding all those homeostatic processes,

1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:47.220
 all the signals that would say, eat, eat, eat.

1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:50.860
 Those don't matter in the brain of the anorexic.

1:27:50.860 --> 1:27:53.740
 The brain of the anorexic is just performing habits

1:27:53.740 --> 1:27:55.500
 and they're being rewarded for it.

1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:57.520
 So when you come along and say, look,

1:27:57.520 --> 1:27:59.660
 you should really eat this whole pie or this whole pizza,

1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:00.700
 you'll feel better.

1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:02.540
 That's actually aversive to them.

1:28:02.540 --> 1:28:04.540
 So since it appears to be a habit,

1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:08.660
 a reflex that's perpetuating the anorexic phenotype,

1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:11.140
 as we say in science, it's perpetuating anorexia

1:28:11.140 --> 1:28:14.060
 in this individual and telling them about

1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:15.900
 all this terrible stuff that's happening in their body

1:28:15.900 --> 1:28:17.160
 won't work.

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:20.660
 Taking them away from all the images of thin people online,

1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:22.580
 et cetera, that's not going to work.

1:28:22.580 --> 1:28:24.020
 What's going to work?

1:28:24.020 --> 1:28:27.340
 What's going to work is intervening in the neural circuitry

1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:29.160
 that's related to the habit itself.

1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:32.420
 And it turns out that there are ways to do that.

1:28:32.420 --> 1:28:33.820
 So how do you break a habit?

1:28:33.820 --> 1:28:35.600
 How do you rewire the brain circuitry

1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:37.560
 that's literally causing a reflex?

1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:39.220
 And in this case, causing a reflex

1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:41.620
 that is killing the individual,

1:28:41.620 --> 1:28:44.720
 or at least leading to very bad health outcomes.

1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:49.700
 The way that you do that is through a cognitive mechanism

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:51.540
 where you teach the individual

1:28:51.540 --> 1:28:53.820
 what is leading up to the habit.

1:28:53.820 --> 1:28:56.040
 This is a little bit similar to the way that

1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:58.120
 somebody who suffers from addiction

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:01.340
 starts to put in different constraint type behaviors.

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:04.360
 Constraint type behaviors are the sorts of things like

1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.260
 where the alcoholic will call a hotel ahead of time

1:29:07.260 --> 1:29:10.780
 and say, listen, I want the mini bar taken out of the room.

1:29:10.780 --> 1:29:12.700
 I don't want a television in the room, et cetera.

1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:14.180
 Constraint type behaviors.

1:29:14.180 --> 1:29:18.700
 Those are really ways of keeping oneself from the temptation

1:29:18.700 --> 1:29:20.020
 but with these habits,

1:29:20.020 --> 1:29:22.340
 they work at such a subconscious level

1:29:22.340 --> 1:29:25.780
 that what seems to work best is a combination

1:29:25.780 --> 1:29:29.960
 of teaching the individual about their internal state

1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:31.700
 and how to register their internal state,

1:29:31.700 --> 1:29:32.900
 what we call interoception,

1:29:32.900 --> 1:29:35.500
 this ability to perceive your internal state

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:38.940
 so that they can start to learn to associate

1:29:38.940 --> 1:29:41.740
 the interactions with different types of food

1:29:41.740 --> 1:29:44.860
 with the sorts of cues that are occurring within their body.

1:29:44.860 --> 1:29:48.300
 Quickening of heart rate, hyperacuity of focus

1:29:48.300 --> 1:29:49.820
 that we talked about earlier.

1:29:49.820 --> 1:29:51.500
 Once they start to be able to notice

1:29:51.500 --> 1:29:53.100
 that those things are happening,

1:29:53.100 --> 1:29:55.000
 then they can start to intervene.

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.380
 So let's talk about what those things are

1:29:57.380 --> 1:29:59.180
 that lead into a habit

1:29:59.180 --> 1:30:02.260
 because those turn out to be the exact points of entry

1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:05.980
 for changing and eliminating and rewiring habits

1:30:05.980 --> 1:30:07.540
 toward more healthy behaviors.

1:30:07.540 --> 1:30:09.980
 And I should highlight that this isn't just about

1:30:09.980 --> 1:30:12.340
 rewiring habits for sake of the anorexic.

1:30:12.340 --> 1:30:14.580
 These are also the same types of mechanisms

1:30:14.580 --> 1:30:16.580
 that one would want to incorporate

1:30:16.580 --> 1:30:19.420
 in order to rewire any habit of any kind.

1:30:19.420 --> 1:30:21.520
 There are two main features of thinking

1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:25.340
 that go into the sorts of habits that anorexics execute.

1:30:26.340 --> 1:30:29.480
 The first is something called weak central coherence.

1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:32.460
 Weak central coherence is essentially an inability

1:30:32.460 --> 1:30:34.960
 to see the forest through the trees.

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:37.960
 It's a hyperacuity and focus on details

1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:38.980
 within a given environment.

1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:41.020
 And there's actually an interesting probe test

1:30:41.020 --> 1:30:44.380
 for anorexia that involves something akin

1:30:44.380 --> 1:30:47.260
 to kind of a Where's Waldo type puzzle

1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:50.100
 where an image is put up.

1:30:50.100 --> 1:30:51.440
 The one that I saw was one in which

1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:54.380
 there was a big array of coffee beans, actually.

1:30:54.380 --> 1:30:55.620
 They're all brown coffee beans.

1:30:55.620 --> 1:30:59.660
 And your job is to identify where in that array

1:30:59.660 --> 1:31:01.660
 of coffee beans, there's a face.

1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:03.660
 And indeed there's a face embedded in there.

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:04.960
 It looks a little bit like a coffee bean,

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:06.560
 but once you see it, you realize it's a face,

1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:08.020
 not a coffee bean.

1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:11.940
 And it becomes very hard to not notice the face after that.

1:31:13.180 --> 1:31:17.220
 Anorexics are very good at identifying the face.

1:31:17.220 --> 1:31:21.180
 They find it much faster than do non-anorexics,

1:31:21.180 --> 1:31:22.920
 which is really interesting, right?

1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:25.260
 They somehow are able to hone in on details

1:31:25.260 --> 1:31:28.960
 and find those details and fixate on those details.

1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:32.340
 Now, eventually most, if not all people find the face.

1:31:32.340 --> 1:31:35.040
 But once you do, what you will find

1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:37.660
 and what everyone finds is that you can't unfind the face.

1:31:37.660 --> 1:31:38.500
 It just jumps out.

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:40.540
 So what essentially you've lost is the ability

1:31:40.540 --> 1:31:43.680
 to see the whole picture because there's some detail

1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:46.180
 within that picture that you're obsessed by.

1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:47.440
 So this has kind of elements

1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:48.840
 of obsessive compulsive disorder,

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:52.160
 but it's not really obsessive compulsive disorder per se.

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:54.620
 So we call that weak central coherence.

1:31:54.620 --> 1:31:58.500
 It's a hyperacuity on one particular feature.

1:31:58.500 --> 1:32:00.200
 You miss the big picture.

1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:02.220
 The other is a challenge in set shifting

1:32:02.220 --> 1:32:04.020
 that once you identify something

1:32:04.020 --> 1:32:06.040
 that's of particular interest

1:32:06.040 --> 1:32:09.820
 and that's driving some sort of reward for the anorexic,

1:32:09.820 --> 1:32:12.260
 that would be identifying the high fat foods

1:32:12.260 --> 1:32:14.260
 or identifying the one food on the table

1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:17.220
 that one could eat without anyone hopefully noticing

1:32:17.220 --> 1:32:19.620
 that they're eating just the green beans

1:32:19.620 --> 1:32:21.420
 and not touching any of the other food.

1:32:21.420 --> 1:32:23.620
 If you ever had a meal with an anorexic,

1:32:23.620 --> 1:32:25.400
 you might be familiar with this.

1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:27.840
 It's kind of uncomfortable to be around actually.

1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:29.700
 They go through a lot of elaborate procedures

1:32:29.700 --> 1:32:31.500
 to kind of hide food, to,

1:32:31.500 --> 1:32:33.760
 they'll sometimes even chew food, hold it in their mouth

1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:35.340
 and then go to the bathroom and discard it.

1:32:35.340 --> 1:32:37.460
 Things very elaborate, very troubling types of things

1:32:37.460 --> 1:32:38.940
 to hear about and to be around.

1:32:38.940 --> 1:32:40.320
 But you'll notice that they push food

1:32:40.320 --> 1:32:41.400
 around their plate a lot.

1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:43.300
 They become masterful actually

1:32:43.300 --> 1:32:45.620
 at trying to keep people's awareness

1:32:45.620 --> 1:32:46.720
 away from what they're doing,

1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:50.300
 which is to home in on these low fat, low calorie foods.

1:32:50.300 --> 1:32:51.780
 And they can't seem to set shift.

1:32:51.780 --> 1:32:54.100
 They can't just relax and enjoy the meal

1:32:54.100 --> 1:32:56.820
 because the meal for them is essentially

1:32:56.820 --> 1:32:58.180
 like this where's Waldo

1:32:58.180 --> 1:33:00.060
 or find the face in the coffee bean task.

1:33:00.060 --> 1:33:02.300
 They're constantly monitoring

1:33:02.300 --> 1:33:04.020
 how much people are observing them

1:33:04.020 --> 1:33:05.700
 and trying to navigate this

1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:08.260
 what would otherwise be a really pleasant circumstance

1:33:08.260 --> 1:33:09.100
 for most people.

1:33:09.100 --> 1:33:10.420
 They're trying to navigate through this

1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:12.060
 because remember for them,

1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.900
 the reward is in the avoidance of certain things

1:33:14.900 --> 1:33:17.380
 and the acquiring of only the foods

1:33:17.380 --> 1:33:19.120
 that their brain rewards them for

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.080
 because those are the foods

1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:22.580
 that have been pre-selected in our now habit.

1:33:23.580 --> 1:33:27.200
 What's amazing and frankly also important

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:29.780
 are these findings that once you teach anorexics,

1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:31.620
 what's happening to them,

1:33:31.620 --> 1:33:33.100
 that they're doing this,

1:33:33.100 --> 1:33:35.000
 they are able to intervene.

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:37.200
 Now they need support, right?

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.780
 And another form of therapy

1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:41.160
 that seems to work well for anorexics

1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:45.540
 that ideally is combined with this habit rewiring

1:33:45.540 --> 1:33:47.960
 is a family-based model.

1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:50.560
 Family-based models are starting to surface a lot now

1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:52.860
 in various therapy settings.

1:33:52.860 --> 1:33:54.800
 Therapy-based models in short

1:33:54.800 --> 1:33:56.860
 are basically where the entire family

1:33:56.860 --> 1:33:59.480
 is made aware of the individual's challenges

1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.980
 with a particular eating disorder or other disorder.

1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:04.420
 And in understanding some of the biology

1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:05.980
 and psychology around it,

1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:08.380
 they stop condemning the individual.

1:34:08.380 --> 1:34:10.100
 They start to support that individual

1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:12.940
 through queuing them towards their own habits

1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:13.760
 that they observe.

1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:14.920
 They give them some autonomy.

1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:17.180
 They realize that none of this changes overnight

1:34:17.180 --> 1:34:19.540
 but they're taught about things like neuroplasticity

1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:21.120
 and the ability to change one's brain

1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:22.420
 in response to experience.

1:34:22.420 --> 1:34:25.520
 And so there's a whole internal support network.

1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:27.360
 Now for people that live alone,

1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:28.620
 this isn't available to them.

1:34:28.620 --> 1:34:29.460
 This isn't the kind of thing

1:34:29.460 --> 1:34:30.540
 that you share with your coworkers.

1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:33.480
 You might involve a close friend or a spouse

1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:35.080
 but it's not the sort of thing

1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:38.540
 that people that don't live in a family context

1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:39.860
 can really benefit from.

1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:42.220
 All of these things fall under

1:34:42.220 --> 1:34:44.900
 the umbrella of cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:34:44.900 --> 1:34:47.300
 And I should mention that cognitive behavioral therapies

1:34:47.300 --> 1:34:50.980
 are often done in conjunction with pharmacologic therapies.

1:34:50.980 --> 1:34:53.120
 I think that there's this idea out there

1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:56.060
 that it's either or when often it's both.

1:34:56.060 --> 1:34:58.440
 So cognitive behavioral therapies are often combined

1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:02.780
 with this habit recognition and rewiring approach

1:35:02.780 --> 1:35:04.900
 which is starting to become more and more common.

1:35:04.900 --> 1:35:07.460
 And I think the data on it look really good

1:35:07.460 --> 1:35:10.620
 that especially when individuals

1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:13.020
 are taught this early in adolescence,

1:35:13.020 --> 1:35:16.500
 that there are positive outcomes over time.

1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:19.020
 The relapse rate of anorexia is quite high.

1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:21.820
 It's about 50% of individuals will relapse at some point

1:35:21.820 --> 1:35:24.360
 often triggered by a stressful life circumstance.

1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:27.540
 But the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy

1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:29.260
 that includes this family model

1:35:29.260 --> 1:35:33.380
 or at least habit reformation seems to be fairly effective.

1:35:33.380 --> 1:35:36.060
 And at present might be the most effective treatment.

1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:38.580
 Now there are additional treatments starting to surface

1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:41.880
 and that takes us into the realm of chemical treatments

1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:44.240
 for anorexia and I just want to mention

1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:46.660
 that there are clinical trials,

1:35:46.660 --> 1:35:48.760
 meaning legal clinical trials being done

1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:50.060
 at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine

1:35:50.060 --> 1:35:51.840
 by Matthew Johnson and others,

1:35:52.700 --> 1:35:55.500
 exploring how drugs like MDMA,

1:35:55.500 --> 1:35:58.900
 which increases dopamine and serotonin to very high levels

1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:01.960
 or psilocybin, so-called magic mushrooms,

1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:04.500
 which increases serotonin and other compounds

1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:07.340
 to very high levels within the confines

1:36:07.340 --> 1:36:11.280
 of a professionally supported therapeutic environment

1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:13.380
 can help people rewire their brain

1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:15.980
 such that they can get relief from major depression

1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:17.380
 and various forms of trauma.

1:36:17.380 --> 1:36:20.900
 And now eating disorders are also being explored

1:36:20.900 --> 1:36:24.960
 in the context of MDMA and psilocybin clinical trials.

1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:28.660
 I do want to emphasize that those are clinical trials,

1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:30.700
 that those compounds are not yet legal.

1:36:30.700 --> 1:36:34.980
 And in many cases, most cases, they are still illegal.

1:36:34.980 --> 1:36:37.860
 I do not think that they should be explored

1:36:37.860 --> 1:36:42.160
 without a properly trained medical doctor

1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:44.580
 that the clinical trials are essential to complete

1:36:44.580 --> 1:36:48.500
 before one explores those compounds in particular,

1:36:48.500 --> 1:36:51.420
 because lately I get a lot of emails about these compounds,

1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:53.940
 people telling me that they've had amazing experiences

1:36:53.940 --> 1:36:56.540
 and relief from various things, not just eating disorders,

1:36:56.540 --> 1:36:58.220
 but depression, et cetera.

1:36:58.220 --> 1:37:02.540
 However, I get an equal number of emails from people saying

1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:05.660
 that they worked with some self-appointed guide.

1:37:05.660 --> 1:37:07.280
 This would be outside the clinical trials

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:08.520
 I was referring to,

1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:12.140
 and they are now experiencing chronic visual snow.

1:37:12.140 --> 1:37:14.960
 They're getting genuine visual field deficits.

1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.020
 They are having ticks that they never had before.

1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:19.260
 They have chronic insomnia.

1:37:19.260 --> 1:37:22.820
 So I'm not passing judgment on any of these compounds

1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:24.460
 or the people that are doing this sort of thing.

1:37:24.460 --> 1:37:26.720
 I just want to see the clinical data.

1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:28.380
 And I do believe that we should wait

1:37:28.380 --> 1:37:30.340
 until these clinical trials are done

1:37:30.340 --> 1:37:32.540
 before people start approaching this stuff.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:36.660
 And that's because they are serious compounds.

1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:38.700
 They can open plasticity,

1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:40.780
 but whether or not they work, quote unquote,

1:37:40.780 --> 1:37:43.700
 for different types of eating disorders

1:37:43.700 --> 1:37:47.800
 or depression and trauma, the data are looking promising,

1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:50.140
 but that the clinical trials are still not done.

1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:52.360
 And I know a number of people are going out of the US

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:53.680
 and into other countries where this stuff

1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:55.940
 is being done more regularly.

1:37:55.940 --> 1:37:58.220
 And there too, I've gotten reports back

1:37:58.220 --> 1:38:00.540
 of people doing so-called ibogaine treatments.

1:38:00.540 --> 1:38:02.900
 Some of you who are familiar with eating disorders

1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:05.300
 will immediately be asking, well, what about ibogaine?

1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:06.500
 Does it work? Does it work?

1:38:06.500 --> 1:38:09.540
 Well, the clinical trials in this country are not complete.

1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:13.300
 I've heard evidence direct.

1:38:13.300 --> 1:38:16.940
 I've heard directly from people who have benefited

1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:19.420
 from the sorts of things for treatment of eating disorders.

1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:21.140
 But I've also heard of people

1:38:21.140 --> 1:38:23.420
 that have developed chronic seizure disorders

1:38:23.420 --> 1:38:25.620
 from pursuing things like ibogaine

1:38:25.620 --> 1:38:28.440
 for the treatment of eating disorders.

1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:29.860
 So again, I'm not passing judgment.

1:38:29.860 --> 1:38:31.700
 I would just like to see more data.

1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:33.740
 And it's very important that the safety,

1:38:33.740 --> 1:38:36.580
 aspects of safety be in place.

1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:39.780
 So this is definitely not something to get renegade about.

1:38:39.780 --> 1:38:42.940
 So it appears that once anorexia is established,

1:38:42.940 --> 1:38:45.940
 that habit breaking through self-awareness

1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:50.520
 of what the habits are is going to be a primary entry point.

1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:52.540
 That might seem kind of trivial.

1:38:52.540 --> 1:38:53.360
 You might say, well,

1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:55.060
 couldn't you have just told us that in one sentence?

1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:58.220
 But I want to return us to this model

1:38:58.220 --> 1:39:01.820
 about homeostatic processes, reward processes, et cetera.

1:39:01.820 --> 1:39:06.220
 That leads us to a place where the short answer is no.

1:39:06.220 --> 1:39:09.100
 You can't simply say break the habit.

1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:11.260
 An individual needs to be informed

1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:13.060
 about where that habit comes from.

1:39:13.060 --> 1:39:17.660
 And the fact that what currently seems like a rewarded habit

1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:20.240
 should actually be a punished habit.

1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:22.520
 Now, I don't mean by actual punishment,

1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:25.020
 but what I mean is within the brain,

1:39:25.020 --> 1:39:27.380
 there's been a switch and the anorexic

1:39:27.380 --> 1:39:29.180
 needs to learn that there's been a switch

1:39:29.180 --> 1:39:32.940
 such that what should be rewarding is now punished

1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:35.900
 and what should be punished, starvation is now rewarded.

1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:38.880
 The beauty of being a human being

1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:42.240
 is that knowledge of knowledge

1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:44.580
 can allow you to make better decisions.

1:39:45.700 --> 1:39:46.540
 I'll say that again.

1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:47.740
 The beauty of being a human being

1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:49.100
 is that knowledge of knowledge

1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:50.980
 can allow you to make better decisions.

1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:55.580
 Now, of course, when we are anxious, when we are tired,

1:39:55.580 --> 1:40:00.140
 when we are intoxicated, we have less access

1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:03.700
 to that ability to use knowledge of knowledge to intervene.

1:40:03.700 --> 1:40:05.740
 The anorexic will often do things

1:40:05.740 --> 1:40:07.700
 that are in keeping with their habits,

1:40:07.700 --> 1:40:09.180
 such as over exercising.

1:40:09.180 --> 1:40:12.540
 This is a area that anyone who's treated anorexics

1:40:12.540 --> 1:40:15.120
 or interacted with anorexics is well aware of

1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:17.220
 that they are constantly moving.

1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:18.540
 They're constantly on the treadmill.

1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:19.620
 They're constantly running.

1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:22.180
 They always want to be moving and burning calories

1:40:22.180 --> 1:40:25.140
 so that they can feel okay about interacting with food

1:40:25.140 --> 1:40:27.960
 or because they have the distorted body image.

1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:30.940
 Well, does breaking a habit mean

1:40:30.940 --> 1:40:33.340
 that they should stop moving around and exercising?

1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:34.820
 No, not necessarily.

1:40:34.820 --> 1:40:36.300
 There's some really interesting studies

1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:41.300
 that show that shifting anorexics towards activities

1:40:41.620 --> 1:40:44.940
 that, for instance, build muscle resistance training

1:40:44.940 --> 1:40:47.900
 and allow them to eat a bit more food

1:40:47.900 --> 1:40:51.660
 without necessarily losing weight,

1:40:51.660 --> 1:40:54.740
 but rather to put more muscle on their body

1:40:54.740 --> 1:40:55.860
 can actually be beneficial.

1:40:55.860 --> 1:40:58.740
 Now, I'm not talking about anorexics becoming bodybuilders.

1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:00.400
 There's a whole body dysmorphia associated

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:01.620
 with bodybuilding,

1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:04.820
 but certain forms of exercise are just catabolic,

1:41:04.820 --> 1:41:06.500
 meaning they break down the amount of muscle.

1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:08.860
 They reduce body weight overall.

1:41:08.860 --> 1:41:11.980
 Other types of exercises like resistance training

1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:13.460
 are anabolic.

1:41:13.460 --> 1:41:15.340
 They allow muscle to be put on.

1:41:15.340 --> 1:41:17.340
 And there are some interesting studies,

1:41:17.340 --> 1:41:19.580
 not a lot, but some interesting studies

1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:23.080
 trying to encourage anorexics not to stop exercising,

1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.420
 but rather to stop exercising in this neurotic catabolic way

1:41:27.420 --> 1:41:28.880
 of breaking oneself down,

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:32.580
 but rather getting them shifted toward breaking habits

1:41:32.580 --> 1:41:34.840
 of only approaching low calorie, low fat foods,

1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:36.940
 while also encouraging them to embark

1:41:36.940 --> 1:41:38.580
 on resistance training

1:41:38.580 --> 1:41:41.800
 and to start to learn and reward the relationship

1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:45.540
 between exercise for sake of making one's body strong,

1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:48.160
 including the bones, not just the muscles, but the bones,

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:50.600
 which is important, especially in anorexics,

1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:53.820
 and then to see food as a way to nourish that process,

1:41:53.820 --> 1:41:56.940
 to building a body that could be of the stable weight,

1:41:56.940 --> 1:42:00.020
 hopefully once the anorexic is of a healthy weight

1:42:00.020 --> 1:42:01.700
 that they're maintaining that weight,

1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:04.300
 but that they don't have to constantly be on this treadmill,

1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:05.500
 no pun intended,

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:09.500
 of balancing whatever food intake they have with activity.

1:42:09.500 --> 1:42:12.540
 And along the lines of that,

1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:15.400
 during the episode on fat loss and metabolism as well,

1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:17.260
 I talked about this NEAT

1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:20.260
 and non-exercise induced thermogenesis,

1:42:20.260 --> 1:42:22.460
 where people who tend to be thin,

1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:24.620
 tend to bounce around a lot, they're kind of fidgety,

1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:26.640
 and that burns thousands of calories a day,

1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:29.180
 anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories a day.

1:42:29.180 --> 1:42:30.940
 Now that can be beneficial for the folks

1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:33.940
 that are overweight and have a healthy mindset about food,

1:42:33.940 --> 1:42:35.380
 but are trying to lose weight.

1:42:35.380 --> 1:42:39.500
 And it turns out that by literally fidgeting

1:42:39.500 --> 1:42:40.340
 and bouncing around like,

1:42:40.340 --> 1:42:41.980
 this is why I'm doing this, it looks ridiculous,

1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:45.820
 you actually burn a lot of body fat and calories that way,

1:42:45.820 --> 1:42:47.560
 provided you're in a caloric deficit,

1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:48.660
 you burn body fat,

1:42:48.660 --> 1:42:50.620
 because body fat is not just a passive tissue,

1:42:50.620 --> 1:42:52.780
 it actually receives input from neurons

1:42:52.780 --> 1:42:55.000
 that release noradrenaline and adrenaline.

1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.220
 And this NEAT has been described for several decades now,

1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:00.860
 and it actually is a pretty terrific way

1:43:00.860 --> 1:43:02.220
 to burn off more calories.

1:43:03.780 --> 1:43:04.820
 So with the anorexic,

1:43:04.820 --> 1:43:06.540
 you actually want to encourage them

1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:09.580
 to not constantly be trying to burn off calories,

1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:10.620
 that can be very challenging.

1:43:10.620 --> 1:43:13.100
 So shifting them toward activities

1:43:13.100 --> 1:43:15.860
 like weight-bearing activities or resistance training

1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:18.900
 that promote this more anabolic type of relationship

1:43:18.900 --> 1:43:22.100
 to activity as opposed to catabolic can be beneficial.

1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:24.180
 Before we move on to talking about bulimia

1:43:24.180 --> 1:43:25.620
 and some related disorders,

1:43:25.620 --> 1:43:27.460
 I want to talk about an aspect of anorexia

1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:30.820
 that's very interesting, quite troubling in fact,

1:43:30.820 --> 1:43:33.500
 but that has received a lot of attention,

1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:38.080
 and that's the distorted self image.

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:40.880
 Now, in the episode on depression,

1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:45.680
 we talked about a very powerful aspect of major depression,

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:47.700
 which is this anti-self-confabulation

1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:51.420
 that people who are depressed seem to genuinely believe

1:43:51.420 --> 1:43:53.240
 and even confabulate about the fact

1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:55.060
 that they are performing poorly in life

1:43:55.060 --> 1:43:58.060
 and that they are no good or worthless, et cetera.

1:43:58.060 --> 1:44:00.660
 It's literally a lie that they believe

1:44:00.660 --> 1:44:02.980
 and their statements and their feelings

1:44:02.980 --> 1:44:05.540
 and their behaviors start to reflect that lie.

1:44:05.540 --> 1:44:06.460
 They're not conscious of it.

1:44:06.460 --> 1:44:08.300
 That's why we call it a confabulation.

1:44:09.860 --> 1:44:14.860
 Anorexics often will see themselves as overweight

1:44:14.860 --> 1:44:18.780
 or imperfect in ways that are of an obsession for them.

1:44:18.780 --> 1:44:19.620
 They'll think, oh, you know,

1:44:19.620 --> 1:44:22.340
 their arms are a little bit fat, you know,

1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:24.900
 or, you know, the contour of their face makes,

1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:28.020
 they don't like the pictures of themselves or they,

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.660
 what I'm describing here is actually pretty typical behavior

1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:31.740
 of a lot of people.

1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:32.700
 I mean, how many people do you know

1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:34.160
 that after you take a picture of them,

1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:35.400
 they say, can I see the picture?

1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:37.580
 And then they tell you that you have to throw it away.

1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:39.380
 That doesn't necessarily mean they're anorexic

1:44:39.380 --> 1:44:41.360
 or they're suffering from some sort of disorder.

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:42.740
 That just means that they're a human being

1:44:42.740 --> 1:44:45.560
 that cares about how they appear in the world.

1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:46.900
 We're not here to judge that.

1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:48.900
 In the case of the anorexic,

1:44:48.900 --> 1:44:53.060
 the problem seems to be that they have a genuine distortion

1:44:53.060 --> 1:44:55.860
 of their self-image so much so

1:44:55.860 --> 1:44:59.180
 that they don't actually see themselves accurately.

1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:01.820
 Their visual perceptions are off.

1:45:01.820 --> 1:45:03.100
 And the reason we know this

1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:05.100
 or it's because of some really important

1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:07.480
 and beautiful studies that were done

1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:10.020
 in my colleague Jeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford.

1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:11.700
 He's in the department of communications.

1:45:11.700 --> 1:45:13.900
 He's actually collaborated with a Dr. Halpern

1:45:13.900 --> 1:45:15.140
 that I mentioned earlier.

1:45:15.140 --> 1:45:16.740
 What's really interesting about these studies

1:45:16.740 --> 1:45:19.820
 is they give us a window into the perceptual defect

1:45:19.820 --> 1:45:21.620
 that anorexics have.

1:45:21.620 --> 1:45:23.440
 I've actually done one of these experiments.

1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:25.020
 I'm fortunate to not be anorexic,

1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:27.100
 but I've done some work with the VR lab over there.

1:45:27.100 --> 1:45:29.340
 And what you get to do is you get to adjust

1:45:29.340 --> 1:45:31.220
 this avatar of yourself to the point

1:45:31.220 --> 1:45:34.620
 where you think it's as accurate as it could possibly be.

1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:39.220
 And anorexics really distort this avatar.

1:45:39.220 --> 1:45:42.160
 In other words, they create this serious mismatch

1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:44.780
 between their perception of themselves and the reality.

1:45:44.780 --> 1:45:47.140
 So indeed it does seem to be the case.

1:45:47.140 --> 1:45:51.360
 Now what's relieving, or I should say what's encouraging

1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:53.700
 about some of the therapies that we talked about before,

1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:57.660
 the family-based model, the cognitive behavioral treatments,

1:45:57.660 --> 1:45:59.580
 yes, and the drug treatments as well,

1:45:59.580 --> 1:46:02.320
 but this habit intervention model

1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:05.680
 is that as one starts to shift those things,

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:09.620
 it does appear that the perception of self seems to follow,

1:46:09.620 --> 1:46:12.020
 that the perception of self seems to shift

1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:14.340
 along with the change in habits.

1:46:14.340 --> 1:46:17.340
 And that's a relief, at least I find that reassuring

1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:21.700
 because changing one's perception is actually very hard.

1:46:21.700 --> 1:46:23.980
 As somebody who's worked almost his entire career

1:46:23.980 --> 1:46:26.480
 on visual perception and related things,

1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:28.980
 the perceptual apparatus of the brain

1:46:28.980 --> 1:46:32.420
 are not very amenable to neuroplasticity.

1:46:32.420 --> 1:46:34.540
 Mainly they don't change that easily.

1:46:34.540 --> 1:46:37.060
 Whereas it appears that the circuitry

1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:39.460
 that's related to habit formation and decision-making

1:46:39.460 --> 1:46:42.780
 and the reward circuitry, that stuff can be rewired.

1:46:42.780 --> 1:46:44.140
 And so anorexics,

1:46:44.140 --> 1:46:47.020
 as they progress out of their anorexic state

1:46:47.020 --> 1:46:51.240
 into one which they are intervening in their reflexes,

1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:52.820
 gaining better habits around food,

1:46:52.820 --> 1:46:57.820
 eating more accurately, assessing foods and environments

1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:00.420
 that they're in related to food,

1:47:00.420 --> 1:47:01.620
 as they change their behavior

1:47:01.620 --> 1:47:03.100
 and they start to put on healthy weight,

1:47:03.100 --> 1:47:04.920
 maybe they're also doing the sorts of exercises

1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:06.780
 that allow them to put on healthy weight

1:47:06.780 --> 1:47:10.160
 and avoiding kind of extreme exercises of catabolism

1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:11.560
 and breaking themselves down.

1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:14.280
 They also manage to somehow,

1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:15.920
 just as a consequence of all that,

1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:18.420
 rewire their perception of self.

1:47:18.420 --> 1:47:20.500
 So it doesn't seem that trying to tell someone,

1:47:20.500 --> 1:47:23.340
 oh my gosh, you're so thin, you really need to eat,

1:47:23.340 --> 1:47:24.880
 that doesn't seem to work.

1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:27.660
 They just don't see themselves the same way

1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:28.700
 that you see them.

1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:31.560
 And so I offer that as a point of consideration

1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:32.900
 if you know someone that's anorexic

1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:34.980
 or if you look at an anorexic and you think,

1:47:34.980 --> 1:47:38.740
 how is it that they are still critical of the small,

1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:40.580
 even non-existent amount of body fat

1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:42.900
 on their triceps or something, how is that?

1:47:42.900 --> 1:47:45.340
 Well, it's literally that their brain,

1:47:45.340 --> 1:47:46.740
 as it relates to perceptions,

1:47:46.740 --> 1:47:48.900
 visual perceptions in particular,

1:47:48.900 --> 1:47:50.120
 that they're completely off.

1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:52.100
 And fortunately, by changing habits,

1:47:52.100 --> 1:47:54.200
 you rewire those circuits as well.

1:47:54.200 --> 1:47:56.620
 Okay, so let's talk about bulimia,

1:47:56.620 --> 1:48:00.820
 which is overeating and then purging,

1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:03.060
 typically by self-induced vomiting

1:48:03.060 --> 1:48:05.180
 or by ingestion of laxatives,

1:48:05.180 --> 1:48:09.380
 sometimes also in concert with people taking stimulants

1:48:09.380 --> 1:48:12.420
 and fat burners and over-ingestion of stimulants

1:48:12.420 --> 1:48:14.620
 to try and burn off more energy.

1:48:14.620 --> 1:48:16.820
 And then we'll also talk about binge eating disorder,

1:48:16.820 --> 1:48:19.960
 which has a lot of the same features as bulimia,

1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:22.020
 but typically no purging.

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:26.420
 I'm not going to list off all the clinical criteria

1:48:26.420 --> 1:48:29.460
 that would allow someone to be diagnosed

1:48:29.460 --> 1:48:32.420
 as bulimic or binge eating disorder.

1:48:32.420 --> 1:48:34.740
 But the general features are that they ingest

1:48:34.740 --> 1:48:37.420
 far more calories than they need,

1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:42.320
 anywhere from 10 to 30 times their daily caloric intake,

1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:45.180
 oftentimes within a two-hour period,

1:48:45.180 --> 1:48:49.060
 which is just a staggering amount of food and nutrients

1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:50.820
 in a short period of time.

1:48:50.820 --> 1:48:53.480
 Oftentimes they're overriding those mechanical signals

1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:55.080
 from the body that they're full.

1:48:55.940 --> 1:48:58.740
 It's a really troubling thing to think about,

1:48:58.740 --> 1:49:01.940
 but people are literally gorging themselves with food.

1:49:01.940 --> 1:49:05.100
 This looks a lot like a laboratory animal

1:49:05.100 --> 1:49:07.580
 that has these AGRP neurons stimulated,

1:49:07.580 --> 1:49:10.180
 these neurons that will eat until they almost burst

1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:11.380
 or burst.

1:49:11.380 --> 1:49:13.840
 So you wonder, is it these AGRP neurons that are active?

1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:16.200
 Almost certainly, yes, that they're involved.

1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:17.840
 Although I don't think that that's going to be

1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:20.300
 the major point of intervention,

1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:23.680
 that we're going to talk about other types of interventions.

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:25.340
 There are a number of clinical criteria.

1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:28.300
 For instance, if somebody has one of these binges

1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:30.820
 once a year, does that make them bulimic?

1:49:30.820 --> 1:49:34.920
 Technically, no, but I certainly don't recommend

1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:36.540
 people do this.

1:49:36.540 --> 1:49:38.520
 If you are one of these people

1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:40.680
 who has so-called cheat days, right?

1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:43.020
 Some of you may be familiar with cheat days.

1:49:43.020 --> 1:49:44.340
 I think they're a little less common now,

1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:47.620
 but the idea is you eat clean for six days

1:49:47.620 --> 1:49:49.420
 or five days a week or two weeks,

1:49:49.420 --> 1:49:50.600
 and then you have a so-called cheat day

1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.980
 where you just kind of go wild and eat whatever you want

1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:54.100
 and whatever volumes.

1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:58.340
 Is that bulimia? It has some of the contour of bulimia.

1:49:58.340 --> 1:50:00.760
 If you're vomiting afterwards or binge eating disorder,

1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:03.740
 if you're not, does it constitute full blown bulimia

1:50:03.740 --> 1:50:04.860
 or binge eating disorder?

1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:06.660
 It's pretty hard to say.

1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:08.180
 The criteria that were described to me

1:50:08.180 --> 1:50:11.260
 is that if somebody is doing this at least once a month

1:50:11.260 --> 1:50:13.820
 over a period of anywhere from two to three months,

1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:16.140
 then it likely would qualify.

1:50:16.140 --> 1:50:19.020
 And I certainly know people who do these cheat days

1:50:19.020 --> 1:50:21.280
 and by those criteria,

1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:23.800
 they have something like binge eating disorder.

1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:26.780
 But in general, one of the hallmark features

1:50:26.780 --> 1:50:28.620
 of bulimia and binge eating disorder

1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:31.860
 is that people are unable to control their eating.

1:50:31.860 --> 1:50:32.780
 They're just simply,

1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:35.420
 they're not making the decision to have a cheat day.

1:50:35.420 --> 1:50:37.880
 They're not making the decision to overeat.

1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:42.180
 They are simply driven from the inside

1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:45.540
 without question by way of neural circuitry.

1:50:45.540 --> 1:50:47.780
 They are driven from the inside

1:50:47.780 --> 1:50:51.260
 to ingest far more food than they need.

1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:54.140
 And in some cases, then they would want to eat.

1:50:54.140 --> 1:50:56.460
 So it's a lot like the habit

1:50:56.460 --> 1:50:58.660
 that we described for anorexia.

1:50:58.660 --> 1:51:00.740
 It's almost like it's turned into a reflex

1:51:00.740 --> 1:51:02.080
 once they get going.

1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:05.300
 All the homeostatic signals are being overridden.

1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:08.300
 All the signals from the body, the leptin,

1:51:08.300 --> 1:51:10.180
 the insulin, the glucose,

1:51:10.180 --> 1:51:12.240
 all that stuff is cosmically sky high.

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:17.240
 And yet they're just what the nerds call hyperphagic.

1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:18.900
 They're just eating like crazy.

1:51:18.900 --> 1:51:21.320
 So what's going on there?

1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:24.460
 Well, there've been a lot of ideas, you know,

1:51:24.460 --> 1:51:26.500
 about why this arises.

1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:30.500
 There's the so-called thyroid hormone hypothesis.

1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:31.760
 That one's a tricky one.

1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:33.660
 It turns out that cortisol

1:51:33.660 --> 1:51:36.540
 and thyroid hormone concentrations vary

1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:40.300
 according to when the binge purge happened.

1:51:40.300 --> 1:51:41.440
 So there were some studies

1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:43.820
 that looked at thyroid hormone levels

1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:47.060
 and they found elevated thyroid hormone levels.

1:51:47.060 --> 1:51:49.420
 Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism

1:51:50.300 --> 1:51:51.920
 and not just the burning of energy,

1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:54.800
 but the use of energy in converting it

1:51:54.800 --> 1:51:56.220
 to different tissues of the body,

1:51:56.220 --> 1:51:59.580
 cartilage, bone, fat, and muscle, et cetera.

1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:02.560
 Did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone,

1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:03.700
 by the way, if you're interested

1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:05.700
 in learning more about thyroid hormone.

1:52:07.420 --> 1:52:10.300
 But thyroid hormone can also be depleted

1:52:10.300 --> 1:52:12.740
 at other phases of the binge purge cycle.

1:52:12.740 --> 1:52:15.920
 Now, without listing off all the terrible things

1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:18.200
 that happen with this binge purge cycle,

1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:19.280
 there are a number of things

1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:21.380
 that are really worth pointing out.

1:52:21.380 --> 1:52:25.220
 One is that the vomiting itself, the use of laxatives,

1:52:25.220 --> 1:52:29.160
 that can cause severe disruption to the mucosal lining,

1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:31.020
 the mucus lining of the digestive tract,

1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:34.100
 can severely disrupt the gut microbiome.

1:52:34.100 --> 1:52:39.100
 It can cause all sorts of even ulceration of the esophagus

1:52:39.300 --> 1:52:41.120
 and just really terrible stuff.

1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:45.700
 There's a lot of shame associated with bulimia,

1:52:45.700 --> 1:52:48.580
 oftentimes because people are vomiting

1:52:48.580 --> 1:52:52.000
 and it's hard to hide that vomiting behavior.

1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:53.060
 People are aware of it.

1:52:53.060 --> 1:52:54.820
 There's some social isolation.

1:52:54.820 --> 1:52:55.860
 So you recall from the beginning,

1:52:55.860 --> 1:52:58.380
 it does not appear that sexual trauma

1:52:58.380 --> 1:53:00.580
 is a prerequisite for bulimia,

1:53:00.580 --> 1:53:02.340
 although sometimes it can occur.

1:53:02.340 --> 1:53:04.060
 The hallmark feature of bulimia

1:53:04.060 --> 1:53:06.780
 that distinguishes it from anorexia,

1:53:06.780 --> 1:53:08.280
 aside from the fact that it's overeating

1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:09.840
 as opposed to undereating,

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:12.780
 is a lack of what they call inhibitory control.

1:53:12.780 --> 1:53:15.100
 And that might come as no surprise.

1:53:15.100 --> 1:53:20.100
 But first of all, the bulimic, unlike the anorexic,

1:53:20.780 --> 1:53:23.780
 is hyper impulsive

1:53:23.780 --> 1:53:26.620
 and oftentimes has other types of impulse behaviors.

1:53:26.620 --> 1:53:28.560
 They might have a little bit of alcohol

1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.520
 and then start to eat like crazy,

1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:32.020
 whereas normally they're very restrictive.

1:53:32.020 --> 1:53:34.800
 That's a common feature of bulimia.

1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:38.140
 Sometimes they over ingest alcohol during these binges.

1:53:38.140 --> 1:53:41.940
 Sometimes they are sexually promiscuous, not always,

1:53:41.940 --> 1:53:45.140
 but it's a general issue with satiety

1:53:45.140 --> 1:53:47.020
 once they start eating

1:53:47.020 --> 1:53:48.740
 and with impulse control generally.

1:53:48.740 --> 1:53:50.380
 And for that reason,

1:53:50.380 --> 1:53:52.380
 many of the treatments that you see for bulimia

1:53:52.380 --> 1:53:54.220
 and binge eating disorder

1:53:54.220 --> 1:53:57.500
 are the sorts of treatments that don't seem to work so well,

1:53:57.500 --> 1:54:00.140
 or at least most of the time for anorexia.

1:54:00.140 --> 1:54:04.160
 So the drugs that increase the neuromodulator serotonin,

1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:06.860
 for instance, fluoxetine,

1:54:06.860 --> 1:54:09.580
 also called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera,

1:54:09.580 --> 1:54:13.860
 those things oftentimes can be effective in bulimia.

1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:15.540
 Some of the drugs that are used to treat

1:54:15.540 --> 1:54:17.980
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ADD,

1:54:17.980 --> 1:54:20.140
 a topic that we're going to talk about in depth

1:54:20.140 --> 1:54:22.300
 here on the podcast soon,

1:54:22.300 --> 1:54:25.060
 some of those same drugs like Adderall,

1:54:25.060 --> 1:54:27.180
 Vyvanse and things of that sort

1:54:27.180 --> 1:54:31.620
 can also be used to treat bulimia and binge eating disorder.

1:54:31.620 --> 1:54:32.620
 Why would that work?

1:54:32.620 --> 1:54:35.260
 Well, now you are familiar with the prefrontal cortex.

1:54:35.260 --> 1:54:36.740
 You probably know more about prefrontal cortex

1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:38.180
 than you ever wanted to.

1:54:38.180 --> 1:54:41.180
 Just from this episode,

1:54:41.180 --> 1:54:43.840
 prefrontal cortex is involved in this analysis

1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:45.420
 of duration, path and outcome.

1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:49.920
 Duration, path and outcome is how we avoid impulsivity.

1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:52.040
 It's how we think, okay, if this, then that,

1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:52.920
 if that, then this,

1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:54.840
 you can imagine how for the obsessive compulsive

1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:57.320
 or for the anorexic,

1:54:57.320 --> 1:54:59.360
 these are circuits that are overactive.

1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:00.960
 For the bulimic,

1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:03.640
 this is the circuit that's going to essentially

1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:07.280
 be underactive and is under conditions where they think,

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:08.600
 oh, you know, I shouldn't eat anything.

1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:09.440
 I shouldn't eat anything.

1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:12.120
 And then they just tear the refrigerator open

1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:13.520
 and plow through that.

1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:16.180
 And then at that point they're plowing through the cupboards

1:55:16.180 --> 1:55:17.320
 and then they're ordering food

1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:19.380
 and then they're feeling horrible about themselves.

1:55:19.380 --> 1:55:22.880
 There do tend to be these cycles of binge and purge

1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:25.960
 followed by feelings of real shame

1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:28.640
 because they just can't control their behavior.

1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:29.960
 And what is more embarrassing

1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:32.960
 than not being able to control one's behavior as an adult

1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:34.640
 or as a young adult.

1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:36.840
 So really the polar opposite of what you see

1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:38.560
 in anorexia.

1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:40.800
 So this lack of impulsivity

1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:43.000
 implies a lack of prefrontal control,

1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:44.180
 what we call top-down control.

1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:45.060
 Why do we call it top-down?

1:55:45.060 --> 1:55:48.040
 Because the prefrontal cortex is suppressing the activity

1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:51.960
 of deeper limbic and hypothalamic circuitry

1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.580
 and things of that sort.

1:55:53.580 --> 1:55:56.640
 Anytime you feel like you want to say something

1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:00.600
 really offensive and you don't,

1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:01.700
 that's top-down control.

1:56:01.700 --> 1:56:03.120
 That's your prefrontal cortex.

1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:06.060
 Anytime someone says something and you like,

1:56:06.060 --> 1:56:07.120
 like grit your teeth,

1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:08.840
 cause you know you shouldn't say anything,

1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:10.520
 gritting your teeth is top-down control.

1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:11.760
 Okay?

1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:15.040
 When you explode or burst or say the wrong thing

1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:17.280
 or say the thing that you shouldn't say

1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:18.560
 or do the thing you shouldn't do,

1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:20.240
 that's lack of prefrontal control.

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:22.640
 And indeed people who have frontotemporal dementia

1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:25.280
 due to aging or head injuries see this a lot

1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:29.640
 and people play sports that get a lot of frontal damage,

1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:31.200
 they become more impulsive.

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:35.600
 So bulimics have an issue with impulsivity

1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:39.540
 and therefore drugs that can increase serotonin

1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:42.400
 and sometimes these drugs that increase dopamine

1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:45.120
 and adrenaline also called epinephrine

1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.760
 will increase the tone as we call it,

1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:51.040
 the dopaminergic tone or the norepinephrine,

1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:52.200
 it's called adrenergic,

1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:54.580
 but norepinephrine levels in the brain

1:56:54.580 --> 1:56:56.280
 allow for more top-down control.

1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:58.840
 And that's also why they're used to treat ADHD

1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:00.480
 and attention deficit disorder.

1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:03.560
 They tend to create a hyper-focus.

1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:05.640
 They tend to push the brain into,

1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:07.200
 these drugs tend to create a hyper-focus

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:10.080
 and tend to push the brain and general mode of processing

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.440
 into one in which you think, if this, then that,

1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:13.300
 if this, then that.

1:57:13.300 --> 1:57:15.240
 So anticipating outcomes.

1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:20.160
 And for that reason, drugs like Wellbutrin, Bupriarone,

1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:21.280
 which is an antidepressant,

1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:23.960
 which mainly increases the amount of dopamine

1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:26.720
 and norepinephrine and less so serotonin,

1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:27.860
 that can also be effective

1:57:27.860 --> 1:57:29.840
 for certain types of binge eating disorder

1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:32.640
 and is actually used to treat smoking

1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:37.160
 for promoting smoking cessation and for depression,

1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:39.880
 but also for certain forms of obesity

1:57:39.880 --> 1:57:41.560
 related to binge eating disorder.

1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:42.700
 And the data are pretty good

1:57:42.700 --> 1:57:44.520
 and there are timed release forms of this

1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:45.640
 and non-timed release forms.

1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:49.200
 And I think you have to consult with a psychiatrist

1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:50.640
 in order to get these prescribed

1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:51.880
 because they are prescription drugs,

1:57:51.880 --> 1:57:55.200
 but it's a very different constellation of neurochemicals

1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:59.200
 and brain areas and approaches for bulimia.

1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:01.560
 The treatment of binge eating disorder

1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:05.240
 has been explored from a new standpoint recently,

1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:07.960
 and that's the work of this now, sadly,

1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:10.320
 former colleague of mine, Dr. Casey Halpern,

1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:13.360
 who's at University of Pennsylvania

1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:14.760
 that I mentioned earlier.

1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:17.400
 They are using deep brain stimulation

1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:19.760
 in order to treat binge eating disorder.

1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:21.640
 Now, why deep brain stimulation?

1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:26.640
 Well, work from Dr. Halpern and others while at Stanford

1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.400
 showed that there are particular patterns of brain activity

1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:33.300
 in both the prefrontal cortex,

1:58:33.300 --> 1:58:34.900
 but also in an area of the brain

1:58:34.900 --> 1:58:36.600
 called the nucleus accumbens,

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:40.260
 very important and very relevant area of the brain

1:58:40.260 --> 1:58:41.120
 in this context.

1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:45.620
 And in any discussion about motivated behaviors of any kind,

1:58:45.620 --> 1:58:48.840
 feeding, sex, drug related behavior,

1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:51.260
 people exercise compulsively,

1:58:51.260 --> 1:58:54.640
 the nucleus accumbens is in a ongoing dialogue

1:58:54.640 --> 1:58:55.860
 with the prefrontal cortex.

1:58:55.860 --> 1:58:58.660
 And the nucleus accumbens has no mind of its own,

1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:00.420
 but it's associated with dopamine release.

1:59:00.420 --> 1:59:03.460
 It's part of this so-called reward pathway.

1:59:03.460 --> 1:59:06.540
 And what Dr. Halpern and colleagues discovered

1:59:06.540 --> 1:59:09.160
 is that there are particular patterns of activity

1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:11.100
 that ripple through the brain

1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:12.940
 through these prefrontal networks

1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:14.980
 and through this nucleus accumbens area,

1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:16.340
 those areas are connected.

1:59:17.300 --> 1:59:18.980
 It's called delta oscillations,

1:59:18.980 --> 1:59:21.300
 delta just being a particular frequency

1:59:21.300 --> 1:59:22.940
 of electrical activity for you,

1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:25.320
 aficionados is one to four Hertz activity.

1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:29.560
 But in any case, those delta oscillations

1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:33.360
 in the nucleus accumbens are associated with food reward

1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:35.040
 in both mice and humans.

1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:38.280
 Somehow this reverberatory activity

1:59:38.280 --> 1:59:40.400
 creates a perception in the individual

1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:42.440
 that food is hyper rewarding.

1:59:43.300 --> 1:59:46.120
 That's interesting and has allowed them to use

1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:48.820
 a targeted deep brain stimulation approach

1:59:48.820 --> 1:59:50.740
 to treat binge eating disorder.

1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:53.120
 And this deep brain stimulation

1:59:53.120 --> 1:59:55.360
 is appearing to be an effective treatment.

1:59:55.360 --> 1:59:57.880
 There's still more studies that need to be done.

1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:01.640
 Actually, if you think you have binge eating disorder,

2:00:01.640 --> 2:00:03.960
 you can find the criteria for that

2:00:03.960 --> 2:00:06.600
 and you could contact Dr. Halpern.

2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:08.640
 As I mentioned, he's moving to University of Pennsylvania.

2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:12.240
 They are recruiting patients for these studies all the time.

2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:13.600
 The studies are fairly invasive.

2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:16.760
 They involve a FDA approved approach

2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:21.040
 of literally placing a wire down into an area of the brain

2:00:21.040 --> 2:00:24.300
 that then allows the individual

2:00:24.300 --> 2:00:26.740
 to stimulate a particular brain area

2:00:26.740 --> 2:00:30.060
 to offset some of these activity patterns

2:00:30.060 --> 2:00:33.960
 that lead to a elevated sense of reward

2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:35.720
 from food and binge eating.

2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:37.420
 And the data look really promising.

2:00:37.420 --> 2:00:39.680
 Now I realize that's a very invasive approach.

2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:42.040
 Not everybody is going to be willing

2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:44.480
 to have this wire inserted into the brain,

2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:47.080
 but for people that suffer from binge eating disorder,

2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:52.080
 this is a great and very exciting potential treatment

2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:53.900
 because what I didn't tell you

2:00:53.900 --> 2:00:57.160
 is that many people have binge eating disorder are obese

2:00:57.160 --> 2:00:59.800
 to the point where their health is greatly at risk.

2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:03.760
 Now, obesity causes all sorts of shifts

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:06.440
 in the dialogue between the brain and body,

2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:07.960
 some of which you'll recognize

2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:09.920
 from earlier in the discussion.

2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:13.580
 For instance, leptin signaling is disrupted.

2:01:13.580 --> 2:01:16.160
 So the fat, there's lots of body fat,

2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:18.000
 but even though that body fat

2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:19.400
 is secreting this hormone leptin

2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:23.160
 and that signal should shut down the desire to eat,

2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:26.920
 the receptors to leptin in the brain are totally screwed up.

2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:29.060
 And so the signal to eat is there,

2:01:29.060 --> 2:01:31.360
 but the signal to stop eating is not there.

2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:33.060
 So again, you have an accelerator and a brake

2:01:33.060 --> 2:01:35.640
 and it's like the accelerator is always pushed down.

2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:37.340
 Some of these brain stimulation approaches

2:01:37.340 --> 2:01:40.020
 seem to be able to bypass some of that.

2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:42.040
 And of course, there are all the metabolic syndromes

2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:45.700
 and the problems with having excess levels of body fat,

2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:48.620
 things like insulin resistance, type two diabetes.

2:01:48.620 --> 2:01:52.640
 I mean, as disturbing as is to hear,

2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:53.780
 there are many individuals, actually,

2:01:53.780 --> 2:01:57.560
 I know some who are so obese

2:01:57.560 --> 2:01:59.700
 that they start getting bodily sores.

2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:00.660
 They're not just bed sores,

2:02:00.660 --> 2:02:05.020
 but they have skin sores that are very disruptive to them.

2:02:05.020 --> 2:02:06.800
 They don't like having these sores.

2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:08.280
 And in addition to that,

2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:10.260
 they can get peripheral neuropathies

2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:12.880
 because of some of these metabolic issues,

2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:17.000
 they're not getting enough utilization of the nutrients

2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:20.780
 in the tissue because the way that insulin is disrupted,

2:02:20.780 --> 2:02:22.840
 insulin signaling, and they actually have to have

2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:24.700
 certain portions of their limbs amputated

2:02:24.700 --> 2:02:26.540
 and yet they continue to overeat.

2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:29.260
 So this is not an issue of self-control

2:02:29.260 --> 2:02:31.560
 that can easily be dealt with

2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:32.860
 simply by telling the person, look,

2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:34.900
 you have to stop eating or you're going to die

2:02:34.900 --> 2:02:36.900
 or you're going to have your legs amputated.

2:02:36.900 --> 2:02:38.280
 Like with anorexia,

2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.800
 there's a distortion in the relationship to food,

2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:45.820
 but the homeostatic and the reward aspects are disrupted.

2:02:45.820 --> 2:02:47.060
 So unlike anorexia,

2:02:47.060 --> 2:02:50.140
 where it seems to be a habit-based mechanism,

2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:53.160
 with bulimia and binge eating disorder,

2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:54.860
 something deep within the neural circuitry

2:02:54.860 --> 2:02:58.240
 is causing food to be hyper attractive

2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:00.060
 and the break is off.

2:03:00.060 --> 2:03:02.140
 So if you want to develop some empathy

2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:04.740
 for what these people are dealing with, consider this.

2:03:04.740 --> 2:03:06.440
 It's like driving a car.

2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:10.600
 You get onto a grade, maybe a 10 or 15 degree grade,

2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:13.420
 and you're heading down and you figure,

2:03:13.420 --> 2:03:15.260
 well, you'll just pump the brakes a little bit,

2:03:15.260 --> 2:03:16.760
 but there is no break, right?

2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:18.900
 So you start going faster and faster and faster,

2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:20.740
 and your only choice is to use the accelerator

2:03:20.740 --> 2:03:21.660
 or just to coast through it.

2:03:21.660 --> 2:03:24.460
 That's essentially what's happening to these neural circuits.

2:03:24.460 --> 2:03:26.380
 So the work of Dr. Halpern and others,

2:03:26.380 --> 2:03:28.140
 I think is really exciting.

2:03:28.140 --> 2:03:29.820
 And even though it's highly invasive,

2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:31.260
 I think it's going to lead to

2:03:31.260 --> 2:03:33.680
 not just some relief for the patients

2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:35.540
 that do get that deep brain stimulation,

2:03:35.540 --> 2:03:38.380
 but also the identification of what sorts of receptors

2:03:38.380 --> 2:03:40.480
 are present in those brain areas

2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:41.480
 that could help.

2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:44.300
 What that means is that once we understand

2:03:44.300 --> 2:03:46.540
 which brain areas are involved in the disorder,

2:03:46.540 --> 2:03:51.380
 and we understand what receptors those brain areas express,

2:03:51.380 --> 2:03:54.080
 then there can start to be additional interventions

2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:56.820
 by way of non-invasive treatments,

2:03:56.820 --> 2:03:58.820
 things like drug treatments.

2:03:58.820 --> 2:04:01.360
 Do behavioral interventions work for bulimia?

2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:02.980
 In some cases, yes,

2:04:02.980 --> 2:04:06.120
 provided that those interventions are done early enough.

2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:09.320
 Regardless, behavioral interventions

2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:11.020
 coupled with drug-based interventions

2:04:11.020 --> 2:04:13.320
 are always more effective than either one alone.

2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:17.100
 Fortunately, there is a decent size kit of drugs

2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:18.100
 that can help with bulimia.

2:04:18.100 --> 2:04:19.300
 I mentioned some of them before,

2:04:19.300 --> 2:04:21.700
 things like buprenorphine, wellbutrin,

2:04:21.700 --> 2:04:23.460
 some of the serotonergic drugs,

2:04:23.460 --> 2:04:26.100
 and some of the drugs used to treat impulsivity.

2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:29.820
 So we have on the one hand anorexia,

2:04:29.820 --> 2:04:31.660
 which seems to be a disruption in habit

2:04:31.660 --> 2:04:35.100
 and a coupling of unhealthy habits,

2:04:35.100 --> 2:04:36.860
 in this case, food restriction,

2:04:36.860 --> 2:04:39.180
 to the reward pathway.

2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:40.380
 And on the flip side,

2:04:40.380 --> 2:04:42.820
 we have binge eating disorder and bulimia,

2:04:42.820 --> 2:04:46.180
 where a very unhealthy habit of gorging oneself with food,

2:04:46.180 --> 2:04:48.080
 sometimes followed by purging,

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:49.940
 is not necessarily coupled to reward.

2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:52.020
 They feel terrible when they do that, right?

2:04:52.020 --> 2:04:54.940
 The anorexic feels great about restricting their food intake.

2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:57.020
 They feel like they're winning some sort of game.

2:04:57.020 --> 2:04:59.640
 The circuitry is flipped somehow that way.

2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:03.780
 With bulimia, they feel horrible about the fact

2:05:03.780 --> 2:05:04.640
 that they're binging.

2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:05.960
 There's immense shame.

2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:08.020
 They can't control themselves.

2:05:08.020 --> 2:05:10.940
 The reward is set up before the behavior.

2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:15.020
 The reward is set up in drawing them to food

2:05:15.020 --> 2:05:17.120
 and in making food look like something

2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:18.820
 that's incredibly appetizing,

2:05:18.820 --> 2:05:21.420
 and there's no impulse break.

2:05:21.420 --> 2:05:24.100
 There's no way for them to stop that kind of behavior.

2:05:24.100 --> 2:05:26.660
 So a really kind of troubling thing to think about,

2:05:26.660 --> 2:05:30.020
 in either case, I think for those of us that know anorexics

2:05:30.020 --> 2:05:31.780
 or have observed anorexia,

2:05:31.780 --> 2:05:34.100
 it's so hard to see somebody starve themselves

2:05:34.100 --> 2:05:35.380
 to near death or to death.

2:05:35.380 --> 2:05:37.780
 What more could be disturbing?

2:05:37.780 --> 2:05:41.940
 Well, equally disturbing is somebody who has an abundance

2:05:41.940 --> 2:05:43.520
 of food and is gorging themselves

2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:45.100
 and then feels terrible about it.

2:05:45.100 --> 2:05:48.820
 So these are heavy topics.

2:05:48.820 --> 2:05:51.540
 These are topics that frankly,

2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:53.040
 no one really wants to talk about

2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:54.980
 unless they know someone who's suffering from them

2:05:54.980 --> 2:05:56.940
 or they themselves suffer from them.

2:05:56.940 --> 2:05:59.700
 What I've tried to do today is try and give you a window

2:05:59.700 --> 2:06:02.700
 into what really underlies these things

2:06:02.700 --> 2:06:05.060
 that we call eating disorders.

2:06:05.060 --> 2:06:07.460
 I hope I've done that at the level of biology,

2:06:07.460 --> 2:06:09.620
 neurocircuitry, mechanism, endocrinology,

2:06:09.620 --> 2:06:11.120
 and some of the psychology.

2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:14.100
 As with any episode of this podcast,

2:06:14.100 --> 2:06:15.460
 but especially in this month

2:06:15.460 --> 2:06:17.900
 where we're talking about mental health issues

2:06:17.900 --> 2:06:20.460
 and mental health disorders, behavioral disorders,

2:06:21.340 --> 2:06:23.580
 there's no way that I can exhaustively cover

2:06:23.580 --> 2:06:25.100
 all the different forms of treatment.

2:06:25.100 --> 2:06:26.420
 You have the model approach.

2:06:26.420 --> 2:06:28.100
 You've got all these different approaches

2:06:28.100 --> 2:06:31.580
 to depression and to anorexia, et cetera.

2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:33.860
 What I've tried to do is give you a framework.

2:06:33.860 --> 2:06:34.700
 And in doing that,

2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:36.660
 I've tried to give you a framework of understanding

2:06:36.660 --> 2:06:39.080
 that also applies to this question

2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.580
 that's I think equally important

2:06:41.580 --> 2:06:43.780
 and goes alongside the treatment of eating disorders

2:06:43.780 --> 2:06:46.220
 is what in the world is healthy eating?

2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:48.640
 What in the world is a healthy relationship to food?

2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:51.000
 I like to think that I have a healthy relationship to food.

2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:53.220
 I know the foods I like, I enjoy them.

2:06:53.220 --> 2:06:55.020
 There are 10 or 15 foods in particular

2:06:55.020 --> 2:06:56.100
 that I like very much.

2:06:56.100 --> 2:06:58.200
 I've mentioned a few of them on the podcast before

2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:03.200
 and was sort of amused, surprised, and perplexed

2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:06.640
 as to why, for instance, I do enjoy eating butter,

2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:09.320
 not in huge amounts, but I do like butter.

2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:11.320
 So that seemed to be pretty triggering

2:07:11.320 --> 2:07:12.440
 for folks out there.

2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:14.800
 A small selection of people decided

2:07:14.800 --> 2:07:17.460
 that the ingestion of butter was a health concern.

2:07:17.460 --> 2:07:22.460
 Look, to me, ingesting butter in small quantities

2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:23.920
 is something that I'm comfortable with

2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:26.260
 and my blood lipid profiles feel good.

2:07:26.260 --> 2:07:27.720
 They look good to me.

2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:29.920
 For other people, that might not be the case.

2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:33.840
 For some people, the idea of eating an animal-based food

2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:35.940
 is probably so repulsive

2:07:35.940 --> 2:07:39.360
 that it actually can make them feel physically sick.

2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:41.240
 And I think that we should be aware

2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:43.800
 that that kind of mental phenotype exists.

2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:45.320
 I'm not calling it a pathology.

2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:46.660
 For other people like myself,

2:07:46.660 --> 2:07:48.840
 things like butter and meat feel healthy.

2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:49.960
 Now, what quantities?

2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:51.900
 Well, I enjoy eating very much.

2:07:51.900 --> 2:07:52.860
 I'm not shy about this.

2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:54.920
 I've talked about it in the podcast before.

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:56.480
 I enjoy eating.

2:07:56.480 --> 2:08:00.080
 Some people have a very complicated relationship to food.

2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:01.720
 They don't think of it as nourishment.

2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:03.700
 They don't enjoy it socially.

2:08:03.700 --> 2:08:05.180
 It's a stressful thing for them

2:08:05.180 --> 2:08:06.920
 based on their personal history

2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:10.740
 or maybe just general anxiety around food.

2:08:10.740 --> 2:08:13.020
 And I hope that in sharing this information

2:08:13.020 --> 2:08:16.540
 about the fact that anytime we approach food,

2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:20.240
 these neurons in the arcuate area of our hypothalamus

2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:22.260
 actually increase our levels of anxiety.

2:08:22.260 --> 2:08:24.880
 This is related to that point that Dr. Halpern made,

2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:27.800
 which was that from an evolutionary standpoint,

2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:30.140
 it is advantageous to ingest as much food

2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:32.520
 as often as possible, as quickly as possible.

2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:35.260
 We now know that to not be healthy in this age of abundance

2:08:35.260 --> 2:08:39.520
 where calories are essentially everywhere.

2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:44.520
 And yet a lot of people feel anxious

2:08:44.540 --> 2:08:45.840
 in anticipation of a meal.

2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:47.340
 What could be useful to them?

2:08:47.340 --> 2:08:50.240
 Well, whether or not they have an eating disorder or not,

2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:53.940
 it's very clear that developing methods to calm oneself

2:08:53.940 --> 2:08:57.100
 in the presence of any anxiety or fear inducing stimulus

2:08:57.100 --> 2:08:57.940
 can be beneficial.

2:08:57.940 --> 2:08:58.980
 I've talked about some of these

2:08:58.980 --> 2:09:00.820
 in episodes related to stress,

2:09:00.820 --> 2:09:02.220
 things like the physiological side,

2:09:02.220 --> 2:09:04.700
 two inhales through the nose and a long exhale.

2:09:04.700 --> 2:09:07.180
 Things like mindfulness meditation certainly can help.

2:09:07.180 --> 2:09:08.900
 There are data, a lot of studies out there

2:09:08.900 --> 2:09:11.860
 showing that meditation practice can help people deal with

2:09:11.860 --> 2:09:14.460
 eating related anxiety and disorders.

2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:15.600
 I think as a general rule,

2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:20.300
 trying to avoid approaching a meal or sitting down to eat

2:09:20.300 --> 2:09:21.940
 in an anxious state is probably a good idea,

2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:22.860
 but let's be realistic.

2:09:22.860 --> 2:09:23.960
 How often can we do that?

2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:27.060
 I think most of us are going to have circumstances

2:09:27.060 --> 2:09:29.380
 where we're rushing around trying to just eat

2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:31.180
 before we head out or get to a meal.

2:09:31.180 --> 2:09:33.560
 And then we sit down and we find ourselves eating.

2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:35.940
 This is one of the first times in human evolution

2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:40.940
 where we mostly eat out of a desire to consume food,

2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:43.100
 not out of a need for food.

2:09:43.100 --> 2:09:46.860
 Most everybody could go a fairly long period of time

2:09:46.860 --> 2:09:49.260
 just ingesting water and electrolytes

2:09:49.260 --> 2:09:50.800
 and not that I'm suggesting people do that,

2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:52.180
 but let's face it.

2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:55.220
 We largely eat nowadays because of a desire to eat,

2:09:55.220 --> 2:09:56.740
 not a need to eat.

2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:59.820
 And yet we need to eat on a fairly regular basis.

2:09:59.820 --> 2:10:04.740
 And so no topic is more complicated and nuanced

2:10:04.740 --> 2:10:06.560
 than food and nutrition.

2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:08.660
 And in particular, as it relates to eating disorder.

2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:12.020
 So the major takeaways today are,

2:10:12.020 --> 2:10:13.180
 we should all be asking the question,

2:10:13.180 --> 2:10:15.240
 what is healthy eating for us?

2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:17.620
 How do we develop a relationship to food

2:10:17.620 --> 2:10:19.460
 that we can enjoy food,

2:10:19.460 --> 2:10:21.820
 hopefully both socially and on our own,

2:10:21.820 --> 2:10:24.900
 but that we are not neurotic and compulsive about it.

2:10:24.900 --> 2:10:26.540
 For those of you that intermittent fast,

2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:28.200
 this also applies, right?

2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:29.540
 What, you know, God forbid,

2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:32.100
 if you eat 30 minutes before your eating window starts,

2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:32.940
 what does that mean?

2:10:32.940 --> 2:10:34.880
 If it means something catastrophic,

2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:36.020
 do you have an eating disorder?

2:10:36.020 --> 2:10:38.700
 I don't know, maybe you have an anxiety disorder.

2:10:38.700 --> 2:10:40.620
 That's for you to explore.

2:10:40.620 --> 2:10:44.060
 If you don't manage to eat five meals a day

2:10:44.060 --> 2:10:45.100
 and that's your obsession,

2:10:45.100 --> 2:10:47.860
 well then, you know, the same thing applies.

2:10:47.860 --> 2:10:50.140
 These are questions that we can all ask ourselves.

2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:54.580
 Today, we focus on the extremes of food-related behaviors

2:10:54.580 --> 2:10:57.980
 that really qualify as genuine disorders.

2:10:57.980 --> 2:11:01.940
 They are in the psychiatric manuals and they are diagnosable

2:11:01.940 --> 2:11:04.980
 and they are serious health concerns.

2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:07.460
 They're not just mentally troubling and concerning

2:11:07.460 --> 2:11:08.720
 for the people suffering from them

2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:09.780
 and the people around them,

2:11:09.780 --> 2:11:12.020
 but they are genuine health concerns.

2:11:12.020 --> 2:11:15.020
 Just want to reiterate that anorexia nervosa

2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:19.780
 is the most deadly psychiatric disorder by a huge margin.

2:11:19.780 --> 2:11:22.220
 And if you look statistically at the number of people

2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:25.660
 with eating disorders and that die of eating disorders,

2:11:25.660 --> 2:11:27.700
 it's not far off from the number of people

2:11:27.700 --> 2:11:29.940
 that die from automobile accidents.

2:11:29.940 --> 2:11:31.940
 I know that that sounds like a ridiculous number,

2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:32.780
 but you can look this up.

2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:35.480
 This is particularly true in certain countries.

2:11:35.480 --> 2:11:37.200
 Why that is, we don't know.

2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:40.020
 But again, this is not a new phenomenon.

2:11:40.020 --> 2:11:44.460
 This is not just related to body image issues

2:11:44.460 --> 2:11:46.920
 that are created through social media and media.

2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:50.180
 And as a final point on that, many of you

2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:53.540
 are probably asking, what about plastic surgery?

2:11:53.540 --> 2:11:56.700
 What about all the steps that people are going to through,

2:11:56.700 --> 2:11:59.460
 excuse me, to preen themselves and change themselves?

2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:01.780
 Are people addicted to plastic surgery?

2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:03.940
 Is that a form of body dysmorphia?

2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:04.780
 And indeed it is.

2:12:04.780 --> 2:12:08.460
 And so we will do an episode on exercise-related

2:12:08.460 --> 2:12:11.900
 and plastic surgery-related body dysmorphia.

2:12:11.900 --> 2:12:14.360
 I think there is very little question

2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:19.360
 that those types of disorders are clearly related

2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:23.620
 to what we're observing in social media and in media,

2:12:23.620 --> 2:12:27.060
 that this shift of, for instance, action heroes,

2:12:27.060 --> 2:12:29.140
 if you look at action heroes in the 80s,

2:12:29.140 --> 2:12:31.520
 there were very few men that were very large.

2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:34.020
 You had your Stallone's and your Schwarzenegger's

2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:38.180
 and a few others, but the men in movies tended to be,

2:12:38.180 --> 2:12:40.740
 if they were muscular, they were far more svelte

2:12:40.740 --> 2:12:41.660
 than they are now.

2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:44.180
 There's this kind of, there's literally a hypertrophy

2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:45.380
 of the imagery.

2:12:45.380 --> 2:12:48.480
 And likewise, there's been hypertrophy

2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:51.500
 of the female body shape as it's portrayed in the media.

2:12:51.500 --> 2:12:55.260
 There are body dysmorpheas that are related

2:12:55.260 --> 2:12:57.660
 to those types of things and that relate to things

2:12:57.660 --> 2:13:02.220
 like plastic surgery, steroid abuse, diet drug abuse,

2:13:02.220 --> 2:13:03.500
 and so on.

2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:06.580
 Definitely important to think about and consider

2:13:06.580 --> 2:13:08.820
 and definitely deserving of its own episode.

2:13:10.500 --> 2:13:12.080
 You've learned a lot of neuroscience today.

2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:13.620
 I hope that was useful in thinking

2:13:13.620 --> 2:13:16.920
 about these disorders and in thinking about other aspects

2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:18.860
 of feeding and motivated behaviors.

2:13:18.860 --> 2:13:21.700
 I would love for you to take away this model

2:13:21.700 --> 2:13:24.060
 that was handed off to me that I think is so powerful

2:13:24.060 --> 2:13:26.500
 for thinking about all sorts of things, not just eating,

2:13:26.500 --> 2:13:28.260
 but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions

2:13:28.260 --> 2:13:31.540
 that you have one box for what you think,

2:13:31.540 --> 2:13:33.200
 one box for what you do,

2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:35.340
 and what is intervening between those?

2:13:35.340 --> 2:13:38.300
 Why is it that you can know better and not do better?

2:13:38.300 --> 2:13:40.700
 Well, it's because you also have to cope

2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:43.620
 with the subconscious homeostatic processes

2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:45.020
 and reward processes.

2:13:45.020 --> 2:13:48.500
 And those oftentimes can be disrupted in ways

2:13:48.500 --> 2:13:51.860
 that we find ourselves doing things that are not good

2:13:51.860 --> 2:13:53.260
 for us or not good for other people.

2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:56.180
 But fortunately there is this great gift,

2:13:56.180 --> 2:13:58.860
 which is that knowledge of knowledge can allow you

2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:01.540
 to do better without question.

2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:04.940
 And that knowledge of knowledge allowing you

2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:06.740
 to do better over time leads

2:14:06.740 --> 2:14:09.080
 to this incredible phenomenon called neuroplasticity,

2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:10.740
 which essentially is translated

2:14:10.740 --> 2:14:14.340
 into doing better over time, even if difficult,

2:14:14.340 --> 2:14:16.900
 eventually makes doing better reflexive.

2:14:16.900 --> 2:14:19.580

 for the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:14:31.780 --> 2:14:33.620
 As well, we hope that you will subscribe

2:14:33.620 --> 2:14:35.220
 on both Apple and Spotify.

2:14:35.220 --> 2:14:37.640
 And on Apple, you have the opportunity to leave us

2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:39.360
 up to a five-star review

2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:41.840
 and to give us feedback there as well.

2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:43.540
 Please also check out the sponsors mentioned

2:14:43.540 --> 2:14:44.780
 at the beginning of the podcast.

2:14:44.780 --> 2:14:47.220
 That's a terrific way to support the podcast.

2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:49.620
 And if you'd like to support research on stress,

2:14:49.620 --> 2:14:52.220
 human performance, sleep, and so forth,

2:14:52.220 --> 2:14:55.620
 you can go to Hubermanlab.stanford.edu.

2:14:55.620 --> 2:14:57.820
 And there there's a tab that you can click

2:14:57.820 --> 2:15:00.880
 if you'd like to make a tax deductible donation

2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:03.060
 to the laboratory to explore the sorts of things

2:15:03.060 --> 2:15:04.660
 that relate to neural circuits, stress,

2:15:04.660 --> 2:15:06.940
 sleep, and human performance.

2:15:06.940 --> 2:15:09.340
 Not today, but oftentimes on this podcast,

2:15:09.340 --> 2:15:11.500
 we discuss various compounds and supplements

2:15:11.500 --> 2:15:15.980
 that people could possibly take in order to help deal

2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:18.460
 with anxiety, improve gut microbiome,

2:15:18.460 --> 2:15:20.420
 improve their sleep, et cetera.

2:15:20.420 --> 2:15:21.500
 We didn't discuss those today,

2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:23.280
 but for those of you interested in those compounds,

2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:25.160
 if you want to see the ones that I take,

2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:29.700
 you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com

2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:32.180
 slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:35.900
 So it's Thorne.com slash U slash Huberman.

2:15:35.900 --> 2:15:37.300
 See all the supplements that I take,

2:15:37.300 --> 2:15:39.580
 you get 20% off any of those supplements.

2:15:39.580 --> 2:15:41.580
 And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,

2:15:41.580 --> 2:15:45.060
 you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

2:15:45.060 --> 2:15:46.100
 We partnered with Thorne

2:15:46.100 --> 2:15:48.820
 because they have the highest levels of stringency

2:15:48.820 --> 2:15:51.280
 with respect to the quality of ingredients,

2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:53.660
 the precision of the amounts of those ingredients.

2:15:53.660 --> 2:15:55.740
 And while supplements are certainly not required

2:15:55.740 --> 2:15:58.300
 or necessary for anything really,

2:15:58.300 --> 2:15:59.620
 you can always use behavioral tools.

2:15:59.620 --> 2:16:02.160
 Many people benefit from taking supplements of various kinds

2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:03.960
 and we do believe that getting supplements

2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:06.100
 of the very highest quality is going to be important

2:16:06.100 --> 2:16:08.460
 if that's the decision for you.

2:16:08.460 --> 2:16:10.060
 And last but not least,

2:16:10.060 --> 2:16:12.460
 I want to thank you for your time and attention

2:16:12.460 --> 2:16:14.300
 and thank you for your interest in science.

2:16:14.300 --> 2:16:41.300
 Thank you for your time and attention and thank you for your time and attention.
