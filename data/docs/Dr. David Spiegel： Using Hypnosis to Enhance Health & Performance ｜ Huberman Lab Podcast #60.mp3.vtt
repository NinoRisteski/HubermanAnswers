00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.520
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.520 --> 00:13.300
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.300 --> 00:15.160
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.160 --> 00:17.640
 Today, my guest is Dr. David Spiegel.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.400
 Dr. Spiegel is the Associate Chair

00:19.400 --> 00:21.260
 of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences

00:21.260 --> 00:23.440
 at Stanford University School of Medicine.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.840
 He is also the Director of the Stanford Center

00:25.840 --> 00:27.620
 on Stress and Health.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.540
 Dr. Spiegel is both a researcher

00:29.540 --> 00:32.160
 and a clinician, meaning he runs a laboratory

00:32.160 --> 00:34.680
 that studies the brain and the body

00:34.680 --> 00:37.880
 and neural mechanisms of how the brain and body interact.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.640
 And he sees patients as a psychiatrist at Stanford.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.480
 His work is incredibly unique

00:43.480 --> 00:45.320
 in that it bridges mind and body,

00:45.320 --> 00:47.360
 but it also has a particular focus

00:47.360 --> 00:50.080
 on the clinical applications of hypnosis.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.280
 As you'll learn today, hypnosis is a unique brain state

00:53.280 --> 00:56.200
 in which neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change

00:56.200 --> 00:58.880
 in response to experience, may be heightened.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.540
 And indeed, the use of clinical hypnosis

01:01.540 --> 01:03.800
 by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues has been shown

01:03.800 --> 01:07.240
 to improve symptoms of stress, chronic anxiety,

01:07.240 --> 01:09.740
 chronic pain, and various other illnesses,

01:09.740 --> 01:11.480
 including many psychiatric illnesses

01:11.480 --> 01:13.440
 and even outcomes in cancer.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.560
 Today, we discuss hypnosis in the context

01:15.560 --> 01:17.540
 of what's called self-hypnosis

01:17.540 --> 01:20.180
 to distinguish it from stage hypnosis.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.580
 Many of you are probably familiar with stage hypnosis,

01:22.580 --> 01:25.240
 which is really about a hypnotist getting a person

01:25.240 --> 01:28.440
 to do things they would not otherwise do.

01:28.440 --> 01:32.360
 In contrast, clinical hypnosis and the use of hypnosis

01:32.360 --> 01:35.020
 for the treatment of various ailments of mind and body

01:35.020 --> 01:36.420
 is vastly different.

01:36.420 --> 01:39.680
 It involves getting people to change their brain state

01:39.680 --> 01:42.080
 and to use that brain state as a portal

01:42.080 --> 01:44.900
 to make adjustments in their brain and body

01:44.900 --> 01:47.080
 and other aspects of their biology and psychology

01:47.080 --> 01:48.340
 that benefit them.

01:48.340 --> 01:50.320
 And it's been shown over and over again

01:50.320 --> 01:52.540
 in studies by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues

01:52.540 --> 01:55.560
 that those changes can occur extremely quickly.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.700
 Now, not everybody can be hypnotized as readily as the next.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.760
 And so today we also discuss a simple test developed

02:01.760 --> 02:03.920
 by Dr. Spiegel that can help you determine

02:03.920 --> 02:06.760
 whether or not you have a high, medium, or low degree

02:06.760 --> 02:08.600
 of what we call hypnotizability.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.640
 Dr. Spiegel is truly an expert in this area.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.720
 He has published over 480 journal articles,

02:14.720 --> 02:17.920
 170 book chapters on hypnosis,

02:17.920 --> 02:20.860
 and on things like psychosocial oncology,

02:20.860 --> 02:22.600
 which is the interaction of mind and body

02:22.600 --> 02:25.040
 in the treatment of cancer and cancer outcomes,

02:25.040 --> 02:27.040
 on stress physiology, trauma,

02:27.040 --> 02:28.800
 and other aspects of psychotherapy.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.680
 He's published 13 books.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.680
 So he's truly the world expert in hypnosis

02:33.680 --> 02:36.680
 and clinical applications of hypnosis for mind and body.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.800
 I'm certain that in listening to today's episode,

02:38.800 --> 02:40.880
 you're going to learn a tremendous amount

02:40.880 --> 02:43.080
 about how the brain and body interact,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.380
 about various treatments for all sorts of common ailments

02:46.380 --> 02:47.640
 of mind and body,

02:47.640 --> 02:49.500
 and you're going to get access to tools,

02:49.500 --> 02:52.560
 in particular, a tool that was developed by Dr. Spiegel,

02:52.560 --> 02:56.060
 which is the Reveri app, R-E-V-E-R-I.

02:56.060 --> 02:58.700
 The Reveri app is currently only available for Apple,

02:58.700 --> 03:01.600
 but will soon also be available for Android.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.960
 It does carry a nominal cost,

03:03.960 --> 03:05.980
 but there is a seven-day free trial.

03:05.980 --> 03:06.820
 If you'd like to try it,

03:06.820 --> 03:08.920
 we're providing a link in the show notes.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.320
 The Reveri app is special in that it is based

03:11.320 --> 03:13.660
 on clinical studies and research done

03:13.660 --> 03:15.800
 in the Spiegel lab at Stanford.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.120
 So unlike a lot of hypnosis apps out there

03:18.120 --> 03:19.640
 and resources for hypnosis,

03:19.640 --> 03:21.940
 it was developed with clinical treatments in mind.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.420
 Today, we also discussed the use of breath work,

03:24.420 --> 03:27.060
 and I'm very fortunate that my research lab at Stanford

03:27.060 --> 03:29.600
 has been collaborating very closely with Dr. Spiegel

03:29.600 --> 03:32.920
 in testing and developing specific breath work protocols

03:32.920 --> 03:35.560
 to adjust mind and body for things like anxiety,

03:35.560 --> 03:37.660
 improving mood, and improving sleep.

03:37.660 --> 03:40.200
 Based on his incredible and unique expertise

03:40.200 --> 03:42.080
 and the clarity with which Dr. Spiegel

03:42.080 --> 03:43.580
 communicates information,

03:43.580 --> 03:46.240
 I anticipate that you will really enjoy today's episode

03:46.240 --> 03:47.680
 and that you'll come away from it

03:47.680 --> 03:49.960
 with a lot of actionable tools.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.440
 Some of you might be curious what a clinical hypnosis

03:52.440 --> 03:54.080
 session looks like.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.680
 And for that reason, we had Dr. Spiegel hypnotize me.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.160
 A clip of that hypnosis session is going to be posted

04:00.160 --> 04:01.600
 to the Huberman Lab Clips channel,

04:01.600 --> 04:03.340
 which is available on YouTube.

04:03.340 --> 04:06.020
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:06.020 --> 04:08.880
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.880
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:10.880 --> 04:13.480
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:13.480 --> 04:16.300
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.400
 In keeping with that theme,

04:17.400 --> 04:20.340
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:20.340 --> 04:22.680
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.280
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:24.280 --> 04:26.640
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.160
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

04:29.160 --> 04:31.880
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.780
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

04:33.780 --> 04:35.320
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

04:35.320 --> 04:38.400
 once or twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational

04:38.400 --> 04:40.840
 vitamin mineral probiotic needs.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.940
 There is now ample evidence that probiotics

04:42.940 --> 04:44.460
 can be very helpful for supporting

04:44.460 --> 04:46.800
 what is called the gut microbiome.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.180
 The gut microbiome is an aspect of our biology

04:49.180 --> 04:51.720
 in which little gut microbiota live

04:51.720 --> 04:53.720
 all along our digestive pathway

04:53.720 --> 04:56.920
 and help support various aspects of our biology,

04:56.920 --> 05:00.160
 including our immune system, our metabolic system,

05:00.160 --> 05:02.000
 our hormones or endocrine system,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.480
 as well as what's called the gut-brain axis,

05:04.480 --> 05:06.960
 which is literally communication between the gut

05:06.960 --> 05:10.120
 and the brain to support things like mood, motivation,

05:10.120 --> 05:13.020
 and various other aspects of brain health.

05:13.020 --> 05:15.200
 With Athletic Greens, I get the probiotics

05:15.200 --> 05:17.760
 that I need to support a healthy gut microbiome

05:17.760 --> 05:20.440
 and the vitamins and minerals tap off any deficiencies

05:20.440 --> 05:23.760
 I might have based on lack of certain foods

05:23.760 --> 05:25.840
 and lack of certain nutrients in my diet.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.180
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:27.180 --> 05:29.760
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:29.760 --> 05:31.240
 to claim a special offer.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.200
 They give you five free travel packs

05:33.200 --> 05:36.200
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.960
 There's a lot of evidence now that vitamin D3

05:38.960 --> 05:41.040
 is critically important for various aspects

05:41.040 --> 05:42.640
 of immediate and long-term health.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.920
 And while many people get enough vitamin D3,

05:44.920 --> 05:46.200
 many people do not.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.860
 So the year supply of vitamin D3 ought to be very useful

05:48.860 --> 05:49.880
 for many people.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.420
 And K2 has been shown to be important for calcium regulation,

05:53.420 --> 05:55.560
 various aspects of metabolic health and so forth.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.760
 So again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens

05:57.760 --> 06:00.080
 and get that special offer, the five free travel packs

06:00.080 --> 06:02.160
 and year supply of vitamin D3 K2,

06:02.160 --> 06:05.040
 go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.600
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.920
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.060
 Nootropic is a smart drug.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.600
 And personally, I'm not a big fan of the concept

06:14.600 --> 06:17.220
 of a smart drug, at least not the way that most people

06:17.220 --> 06:19.740
 talk about smart drugs or nootropics,

06:19.740 --> 06:21.800
 for the following reason.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.980
 Being smart involves various things.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.960
 There is creativity, there's focus,

06:25.960 --> 06:27.960
 there's task switching and so on.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.280
 And each one of those involves different operations

06:30.280 --> 06:31.720
 in the brain, different neural circuits,

06:31.720 --> 06:34.240
 different neurochemicals have to be deployed

06:34.240 --> 06:36.780
 in order for us to, for instance, be very focused

06:36.780 --> 06:38.500
 or for us to be very creative

06:38.500 --> 06:41.780
 or for us to be able to switch tasks easily.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.080
 Thesis understands this.

06:43.080 --> 06:46.440
 And for that reason, they've developed custom nootropics

06:46.440 --> 06:48.960
 that are aimed at getting your brain and body

06:48.960 --> 06:52.760
 into particular states for particular types of work

06:52.760 --> 06:54.320
 or physical activity.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.480
 In order to accomplish that,

06:55.480 --> 06:58.080
 they created unique blends of high quality ingredients.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.440
 And each of those blends is designed to get your brain

07:00.440 --> 07:02.960
 and body into a particular mode, such as focus,

07:02.960 --> 07:04.640
 clarity, or motivation.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.720
 I've been using Thesis nootropics for over six months now.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.760
 And I have to say, it's been a total game changer

07:09.760 --> 07:12.480
 and very unique from the experience of using

07:12.480 --> 07:14.520
 sort of what I call catch all nootropics.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.280
 So with Thesis, it's really directed

07:16.280 --> 07:18.360
 toward particular brain body states.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.860
 I should also mention that they tailor

07:19.860 --> 07:21.520
 those custom blends to you.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.320
 So by taking a quiz on their site,

07:23.320 --> 07:25.680
 they will tailor the blend to you and your specific needs

07:25.680 --> 07:27.020
 and the things you don't want.

07:27.020 --> 07:28.120
 So if you want to try your own

07:28.120 --> 07:29.620
 personalized nootropic starter kit,

07:29.620 --> 07:33.260
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.520
 You'll take a three minute quiz

07:34.520 --> 07:36.560
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

07:36.560 --> 07:37.800
 to try in your first month.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.760
 And then based on the outcomes with those,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.880
 they can update your formulations for you.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.920
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

07:47.520 --> 07:50.040
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.840
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

07:51.840 --> 07:54.000
 that I believe are of the utmost quality.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.040
 The company was founded by two all American swimmers

07:56.040 --> 07:58.080
 from Stanford and everything about the design

07:58.080 --> 08:00.100
 of Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

08:00.100 --> 08:02.600
 was created with performance in mind.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.360
 There are a number of things about Roka sunglasses

08:04.360 --> 08:06.380
 and eyeglasses that I particularly like.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.380
 First of all, they're extremely lightweight.

08:08.380 --> 08:10.120
 You basically forget that you're wearing them.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.200
 Second of all, you can wear them for work,

08:12.200 --> 08:13.740
 for going out to dinner, et cetera.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.840
 They have great aesthetics, so you can wear them anywhere,

08:15.840 --> 08:17.500
 but also for exercise.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.320
 You can wear them when running or cycling.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.760
 And even if you get sweaty,

08:20.760 --> 08:23.040
 they're designed so that they don't slip off your face.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.860
 Another terrific feature of Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

08:25.860 --> 08:27.800
 is that they were designed with the biology

08:27.800 --> 08:29.720
 of the visual system in mind.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.880
 We all have the experience of being in a shaded area

08:31.880 --> 08:32.960
 and then going to a bright area.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.080
 It takes some time for your eyes to adjust or to adapt.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.060
 Many sunglasses make it hard to see

08:38.060 --> 08:39.840
 as you move from one environment to the next

08:39.840 --> 08:42.240
 and therefore you have to take on and off your sunglasses.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.300
 With Roka sunglasses, you don't have to do that.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.600
 You don't even notice the transitions

08:45.600 --> 08:47.760
 between those bright areas and those dimmer areas.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.440
 So you can wear them anywhere, anytime.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.960
 And again, most of the time you don't even realize

08:50.960 --> 08:52.320
 that they're on your face.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.920
 If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,

09:06.260 --> 09:09.240
 And now for my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.160
 David, thank you so much for being here.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.360
 Andrew, my pleasure.

09:13.240 --> 09:17.300
 Can you tell us what is hypnosis?

09:18.500 --> 09:21.880
 Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.140
 It's something like looking through the telephoto lens

09:24.140 --> 09:26.080
 of a camera in consciousness.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.880
 What you see, you see with great detail,

09:27.880 --> 09:30.300
 but devoid of context.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.080
 If you've had the experience of getting so caught up

09:33.080 --> 09:35.380
 in a good movie that you forget you're watching a movie

09:35.380 --> 09:37.520
 and enter the imagined world, you're part of the movie,

09:37.520 --> 09:38.800
 not part of the audience,

09:38.800 --> 09:41.800
 you're experiencing it, you're not evaluating it.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.480
 That's a hypnotic like experience

09:43.480 --> 09:46.200
 that many people have in their everyday lives.

09:46.200 --> 09:50.960
 So is any experience that really draws us in hypnotic

09:50.960 --> 09:51.920
 in that sense?

09:51.920 --> 09:55.800
 Or let me give a different example.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.600
 If I'm watching a sports game

09:58.600 --> 10:00.680
 and I'm really wrapped up in the game,

10:00.680 --> 10:03.720
 but I'm also in touch with how it makes me feel in my body,

10:03.720 --> 10:07.880
 kind of registering the excitement or the anticipation,

10:07.880 --> 10:10.080
 is that a state of hypnosis also?

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
 Because you mentioned there's kind of a narrowing

10:12.640 --> 10:16.000
 of context, but a kind of losing of the self.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.880
 Or do I have that right?

10:17.880 --> 10:22.800
 Yes, it is true that to the extent that your somatic,

10:22.800 --> 10:27.080
 your body experience is a part of the sport event

10:27.080 --> 10:28.680
 that you're engaged with,

10:28.680 --> 10:32.660
 I'd say that is a self-altering hypnotic experience.

10:32.660 --> 10:35.560
 If your physical reactions are distracting you

10:35.560 --> 10:38.800
 or make you think about something else,

10:38.800 --> 10:41.680
 that's when it's less hypnotic like

10:41.680 --> 10:44.320
 and more just one of a series of experiences.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.440
 Okay.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.120
 So I have to ask,

10:47.120 --> 10:50.280
 how did you get into this business of hypnosis?

10:50.280 --> 10:52.960
 Because I think for most people,

10:52.960 --> 10:55.760
 when they hear hypnosis or they think about hypnosis,

10:55.760 --> 10:57.600
 they think of stage hypnosis.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.120
 I think of somebody with a pendant going back and forth

11:00.120 --> 11:02.440
 or people up on a stage,

11:02.440 --> 11:07.440
 you're behaving abnormally for the entertainment of others.

11:09.080 --> 11:14.080
 How did you get into hypnosis as an interest, as a practice?

11:14.160 --> 11:15.800
 And if you would,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.920
 could you contrast the sort of hypnosis that you do

11:18.920 --> 11:21.320
 in the clinical setting with the sort of hypnosis

11:21.320 --> 11:22.900
 that a stage hypnotist does?

11:22.900 --> 11:24.040
 Sure.

11:24.040 --> 11:28.560
 Well, it is something of a genetic illness in my family.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.440
 Both of my parents were psychiatrists and psychoanalysts

11:32.440 --> 11:35.120
 and they told me I was free to be any kind of psychiatrist

11:35.120 --> 11:37.560
 I wanted to be, so here I am.

11:38.520 --> 11:42.880
 My father was training to be a psychoanalyst in 1943

11:45.080 --> 11:49.880
 and he ran into a Viennese refugee

11:49.880 --> 11:54.400
 who couldn't serve in the army but who had studied hypnosis.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.400
 And actually it would interest you

11:56.400 --> 11:58.640
 doing your ophthalmological research.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.960
 He had a smallpox scar right in the middle of his forehead

12:01.960 --> 12:03.760
 and he did forensic examinations

12:03.760 --> 12:05.920
 and he noticed that some of the prisoners

12:05.920 --> 12:08.680
 would focus on that spot on his forehead

12:08.680 --> 12:11.920
 and then close their eyes and seem to go to sleep

12:11.920 --> 12:13.960
 but they were in some altered state.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.680
 So he got interested in hypnosis.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.600
 He used it forensically.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.440
 His name was Gustav von Aschaffenburg

12:21.440 --> 12:25.200
 and he offered to teach young psychiatrists

12:25.200 --> 12:29.560
 how to use hypnosis when they went off into the war.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.920
 And so he trained my father

12:31.920 --> 12:34.600
 and my father got off the analytic couch

12:34.600 --> 12:37.640
 and the analyst mentioned it to him.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.160
 That's how he found out about it.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.440
 And my father said, did I say something wrong in analysis?

12:41.440 --> 12:43.720
 Why is he talking to me now?

12:43.720 --> 12:47.000
 And he found it very useful in helping soldiers

12:47.000 --> 12:49.200
 who had acute pain when they were wounded

12:49.200 --> 12:50.800
 and helping people with conversion

12:50.800 --> 12:52.920
 post-traumatic stress disorders.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.440
 And when he came back, he went back to his training

12:56.440 --> 12:59.400
 but he still was sort of interested in it.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.920
 And he had his, one of his supervisors

13:01.920 --> 13:05.520
 was Frieda Fromreichmann who was a very famous psychoanalyst

13:05.520 --> 13:09.320
 and he said that he had been told to stop doing hypnosis

13:09.320 --> 13:12.120
 because it would ruin his reputation as an analyst.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.960
 And she said to him, what are you so worried

13:13.960 --> 13:15.640
 about your reputation for?

13:15.640 --> 13:18.400
 You're gonna give a course at the institute in hypnosis

13:18.400 --> 13:20.520
 and I know you're gonna do it because I'm gonna take it.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.680
 So he was teaching Frieda Fromreichmann hypnosis

13:23.680 --> 13:25.680
 and he just kept doing it and after a while

13:25.680 --> 13:28.520
 he discovered that he was getting better results

13:28.520 --> 13:30.200
 with a few sessions of hypnosis

13:30.200 --> 13:34.200
 than he was with daily psychoanalysis with his patients

13:34.200 --> 13:36.520
 and so he switched his practice.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.200
 And so the dinner table conversations

13:38.200 --> 13:40.200
 were pretty interesting and occasionally

13:40.200 --> 13:42.400
 when he was making a movie of a patient,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.240
 I would get to watch that.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.920
 And so when I went to medical school,

13:47.920 --> 13:49.160
 I figured I'll take a course.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.360
 There was Tom Hackett who was a chair of psychiatry

13:51.360 --> 13:52.680
 at Mass General was teaching it.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.760
 It was a very interesting course.

13:54.760 --> 13:59.680
 And the day that converted me was I was doing my rotation

13:59.680 --> 14:01.240
 at Children's Hospital in Boston

14:01.240 --> 14:02.680
 and the nurse is telling me,

14:02.680 --> 14:04.840
 Spiegel, your next patient is an asthmatic

14:04.840 --> 14:07.680
 in room 437 or something and I'm just following

14:07.680 --> 14:09.680
 the sound of the wheezes down the hall.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.720
 I go in the room, this is 16-year-old girl,

14:11.720 --> 14:14.720
 knuckles white, bolt upright in bed, struggling for breath.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.080
 You can hear the wheezing.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.720
 She twice had subcutaneous epinephrine, didn't work.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.480
 They were thinking about general anesthesia

14:20.480 --> 14:22.480
 and starting her on steroids.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.240
 And her mother's there crying.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.080
 And I said, I don't know what else to do.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.200
 So I said, you want to learn a breathing exercise?

14:30.200 --> 14:33.560
 And she nods and I got her hypnotized.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.760
 And then I realized we hadn't gotten

14:34.760 --> 14:36.000
 to asthma in the course yet.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.880
 So I made up something very complex.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.600
 I said, each breath you take will be a little deeper

14:40.600 --> 14:42.080
 and a little easier.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.160
 And within five minutes, she's lying back in bed.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.920
 Her knuckles aren't white, she's not wheezing.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.600
 Her mother stopped crying.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.440
 The nurse ran out of the room.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.200
 And my intern comes to find me.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.120
 And I figure he's going to pat me on the back

14:53.120 --> 14:54.920
 and say, nice job, Spiegel.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.120
 He said, the nurse has filed a complaint with a nursing

14:57.120 --> 14:59.960
 supervisor that you violated a Massachusetts law

14:59.960 --> 15:03.800
 by hypnotizing a minor without parental consent.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.440
 And I thought, well, that's nice.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.520
 I doubt there is a law like this.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.120
 So the intern says, you're going to have

15:11.120 --> 15:12.360
 to stop doing this with her.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.040
 And I said, why?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.200
 He said, it's dangerous.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.480
 I said, you're going to give her generalized anesthesia

15:16.480 --> 15:19.600
 and put her on steroids, and talking to her is dangerous?

15:19.600 --> 15:21.100
 He said, well, you'll have to do it.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.160
 And I said, I'll tell you what, take me off the case

15:23.160 --> 15:23.720
 if you want.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.480
 But I'm not going to tell a patient of mine

15:25.480 --> 15:27.320
 anything I know is not true.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.360
 So there was a battle over the weekend about what to do.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.400
 And the intern, the chief resident, attending,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.000
 we're all arguing about it.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.960
 And on Monday, they came back with a radical idea.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.320
 They said, let's ask the patient.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.720
 I don't think this has ever been done at Children's Hospital

15:42.720 --> 15:43.220
 before.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.040
 And she said, oh, I like this.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.120
 She'd been hospitalized every month for three months

15:47.120 --> 15:48.680
 in status asthmaticus.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.640
 She did have one subsequent hospitalization,

15:50.640 --> 15:54.240
 but after that, went on to study to be a respiratory therapist.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.000
 And I thought that anything that can help a patient that much,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.880
 violate a nonexistent Massachusetts law,

15:59.880 --> 16:01.460
 frustrate the nursing supervisor,

16:01.460 --> 16:02.880
 had to be worth looking into.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.840
 So I just kept doing it.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.560
 I discovered that all of my classmates in medical school

16:08.560 --> 16:10.800
 had just read the new issue of the New England Journal

16:10.800 --> 16:13.240
 and had some new medication to suggest.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.000
 And surgeons would say, look, if you

16:16.000 --> 16:19.200
 can help this guy with his pain or his anxiety, anything

16:19.200 --> 16:20.440
 above the neck, that's yours.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.120
 Do it, Spiegel.

16:21.120 --> 16:25.140
 So I was having fun and being able to learn

16:25.140 --> 16:28.200
 how to help people in a way that just otherwise was not

16:28.200 --> 16:28.960
 being done.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.040
 And so it got me thinking about the fact

16:32.040 --> 16:33.960
 that we're born with this brain, but we don't

16:33.960 --> 16:35.360
 have a user's manual for it.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.680
 And we don't use it nearly as well as we can.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.520
 And that's something your research is all about, too.

16:40.520 --> 16:44.080
 And so I thought, I want to understand this better,

16:44.080 --> 16:45.800
 and I want to see what we can do.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.800
 Stage hypnotists drive me nuts.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.960
 They make fools out of people.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.200
 There was one, this is a case my father was involved.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.000
 He got a call from, he was at Columbia.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.400
 He got a call, Spiegel, you got to come see this woman.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.960
 She's in the ER, and she's in some kind of weird upset state

17:03.960 --> 17:05.560
 that happened.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.840
 And it turned out she'd been on the show with a stage

17:07.840 --> 17:11.240
 hypnotist who, and what they do, by the way,

17:11.240 --> 17:12.880
 is they cycle around.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.600
 They have, at the beginning of the show,

17:14.600 --> 17:17.000
 they don't just grab somebody and say, we're doing this.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.400
 They get a bunch of people up.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.800
 They do what amounts to hypnotizability testing

17:20.800 --> 17:23.120
 to see if people, and they get the ones who

17:23.120 --> 17:24.520
 are the most hypnotizable.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.360
 So she was the one.

17:26.360 --> 17:30.440
 And he said, there's now a little bird in your hand,

17:30.440 --> 17:32.500
 and you're going to play with a bird.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.560
 And she starts to cry and scream.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.960
 And he just gets her off the stage because it's

17:37.960 --> 17:39.220
 very upsetting.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.880
 And she's wandering around New York City

17:40.880 --> 17:43.640
 in the middle of the night, dissociated,

17:43.640 --> 17:44.780
 and brought to Columbia.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.160
 And that's where my father saw her.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.000
 She was still in a kind of uncomfortable,

17:48.000 --> 17:48.800
 trance-like state.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.160
 And it turned out that she was the trophy

17:51.160 --> 17:53.120
 wife of a very wealthy guy.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.080
 And she felt like a bird in a gilded cage.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.360
 And so to her, that image just triggered

17:59.360 --> 18:03.040
 all of this sense of dissatisfaction, discomfort,

18:03.040 --> 18:04.720
 fear about her life.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.160
 And he was able to get her reoriented and talk

18:07.160 --> 18:09.400
 with her about what she was going to do with her life.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.280
 But I don't like stage hypnosis.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.280
 You're making fools out of people.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.520
 And you're using the fact.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.320
 And that's what scares people about hypnosis.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.160
 They think you're losing control.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.100
 You're gaining control.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.960
 Self-hypnosis is a way of enhancing your control

18:21.960 --> 18:24.100
 over your mind and your body.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.680
 It can work very well.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.220
 But because it gives you a kind of cognitive flexibility,

18:29.220 --> 18:32.560
 you're able to shift sets very easily,

18:32.560 --> 18:35.360
 to give up judging and evaluating the way you usually

18:35.360 --> 18:38.720
 do, and see something from a different point of view.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.920
 That's a great therapeutic opportunity.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.360
 But if misused, it could be a danger too.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.160
 And that's what scares people about it.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.760
 It is that very ability to suspend critical judgment

18:48.760 --> 18:51.320
 and just have an experience and see what happens.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.800
 That can be a great therapeutic opportunity.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.520
 But if somebody is misusing it, it can be a way to harm people.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.200
 And there are plenty of examples of people

19:00.200 --> 19:02.280
 having fantasies imposed on them that they

19:02.280 --> 19:03.520
 come to think are realities.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.160
 It's not unusual these days.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.040
 So it's an ability that, if people

19:09.040 --> 19:11.320
 learn to recognize and understand it,

19:11.320 --> 19:14.360
 can be a tremendous therapeutic tool.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.320
 I've been staged hypnotized.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.320
 And I've been clinically hypnotized many times

19:22.320 --> 19:25.840
 through a self-hypnosis app we'll talk about later.

19:25.840 --> 19:30.080
 And then I know we have plans for you to hypnotize me today.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.920
 You've done it once before.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.520
 And I'm very hypnotizable, as we both know.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.320
 We'll talk about how one can gauge their hypnotizability.

19:39.320 --> 19:42.760
 But the staged hypnosis was interesting.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.880
 This was in college.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.600
 They brought someone out to the dormitory.

19:45.600 --> 19:50.600
 And I recall being one of the people that was selected

19:54.360 --> 19:57.880
 and engaging in very bizarre behavior.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.320
 It wasn't thoroughly embarrassing,

19:59.320 --> 20:00.880
 but it was pretty embarrassing.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.320
 And then being sent off the stage,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.960
 and as I was exiting, suddenly screaming something out

20:06.960 --> 20:10.320
 because he had planted a suggestion of some sort.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.440
 And then I was told to look in my pocket.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.880
 And there was like, I think, a torn up dollar bill.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.840
 There were a bunch of things

20:15.840 --> 20:17.920
 that I have vague recollection of.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.280
 But it raises a set of questions

20:22.840 --> 20:27.040
 that really boil down to, as a biologist,

20:27.040 --> 20:30.400
 I always think that there's no events in the brain.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.040
 There are processes.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.120
 And so hypnosis, we know, has an induction.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.160
 Then one is hypnotized, I imagine.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.680
 And then it sounds like this woman

20:38.680 --> 20:41.080
 and this example of the bird

20:41.080 --> 20:44.480
 and being distraught in New York City

20:44.480 --> 20:47.720
 is a failure to exit the hypnotic state.

20:47.720 --> 20:51.400
 Do we know what sorts of brain areas are active

20:51.400 --> 20:55.400
 during the induction, the, let's call it the deep hypnosis,

20:55.400 --> 20:57.680
 and then what's shutting off or changing

20:57.680 --> 20:59.640
 as people exit hypnosis?

20:59.640 --> 21:00.800
 Yes, yes, we do.

21:00.800 --> 21:01.640
 We've studied that.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.720
 We've been very interested in that.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.720
 And so we did a study where we selected

21:06.720 --> 21:09.600
 highly and non-hypnotizable people

21:09.600 --> 21:11.600
 so we could do the comparison

21:11.600 --> 21:14.960
 and then hypnotize them in the functional MRI scanner.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.320
 And we found three things

21:17.320 --> 21:20.160
 characterize the entry into the hypnotic state.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.080
 The first is turning down activity

21:22.080 --> 21:24.120
 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.800
 So the DACC is in the central front middle part

21:26.800 --> 21:28.800
 of the brain, as you well know.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.360
 And it's part of what we call the salience network.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.200
 It's a conflict detector.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.000
 So if you're engaged in work

21:39.000 --> 21:40.040
 and you hear a loud noise

21:40.040 --> 21:41.520
 that you think might be a gunshot,

21:41.520 --> 21:43.600
 that's your anterior cingulate cortex saying,

21:43.600 --> 21:44.480
 hey, wait a minute,

21:44.480 --> 21:46.000
 there's a potential danger over there.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.240
 You better pay attention to it.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.240
 So it compares what you're doing

21:50.240 --> 21:51.480
 with what else is going on

21:51.480 --> 21:53.720
 and helps you decide what to do.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.880
 And as you can imagine,

21:56.800 --> 21:58.600
 turning down activity in that region,

21:58.600 --> 22:00.600
 make it less likely that you'll be distracted

22:00.600 --> 22:02.800
 and pulled out of whatever you're in.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.160
 And in another study,

22:04.160 --> 22:06.000
 we found that highly hypnotizable people,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.960
 even without being hypnotized,

22:07.960 --> 22:10.400
 have more functional connectivity

22:10.400 --> 22:13.480
 between the DACC, the anterior cingulate cortex,

22:13.480 --> 22:16.320
 and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

22:17.520 --> 22:19.320
 which is part of a key region

22:19.320 --> 22:20.840
 in the executive control network.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.440
 So when you're engaging in tasks,

22:22.440 --> 22:24.640
 you're enacting a plan,

22:24.640 --> 22:25.520
 you're writing a paper,

22:25.520 --> 22:26.440
 you're doing whatever you're doing,

22:26.440 --> 22:29.920
 that's the prefrontal cortex is doing that.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.960
 And so if that is coordinated,

22:31.960 --> 22:34.640
 we found more functional connectivity.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.040
 So when one is up, the other's up,

22:37.040 --> 22:38.520
 when one is down, the other's down.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.840
 That coordination implies that the brain is saying,

22:41.840 --> 22:44.200
 okay, go ahead, I know what you're doing,

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
 carry out that plan

22:45.200 --> 22:47.600
 and don't worry about other possibilities.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.520
 So two other things happen when people are hypnotized.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.360
 One is that that DLPFC

22:52.360 --> 22:55.240
 has higher functional connectivity with the insula.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.040
 Another part of the salience network,

22:57.040 --> 22:59.920
 it's a part of the mind-body control system,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.840
 sensitive to what's happening in the body,

23:01.840 --> 23:04.160
 it's part of the pain network as well.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.000
 But it's also a region of the brain

23:06.000 --> 23:09.080
 where you can control things in your body

23:09.080 --> 23:10.280
 that you wouldn't think you could.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.680
 For example, we did a study years ago

23:12.680 --> 23:15.840
 where we took people who were highly hypnotizable,

23:15.840 --> 23:18.480
 hypnotized them and told them to,

23:18.480 --> 23:21.080
 we went on an imaginary culinary tour.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.360
 So they would eat their favorite foods.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.880
 And we found that they increased

23:25.880 --> 23:29.400
 their gastric acid secretion by 87%.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.520
 So their stomach was acting as though it was about to get,

23:32.520 --> 23:34.760
 I mean, there was one woman, it was so vivid for her

23:34.760 --> 23:37.960
 that halfway through she said, let's stop, I'm full.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.800
 Eating these imaginary foods.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.080
 Having never eaten an actual food.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.360
 No. Incredible.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.560
 And then we got them to relax

23:44.560 --> 23:46.800
 and think of anything but food or drink.

23:46.800 --> 23:51.320
 And we got like a 40% decrease in gastric acid secretion.

23:51.320 --> 23:55.240
 So they could, and that was DLPFC through the insula

23:55.240 --> 23:56.800
 telling the stomach you're getting food

23:56.800 --> 23:57.840
 or you're not getting food.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.480
 And even, we injected them with pentagastrin,

24:00.480 --> 24:03.000
 which triggers gastric acid release.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.880
 And even then in the hypnosis condition

24:04.880 --> 24:07.760
 they had a 19% reduction in gastric acid.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.160
 So the brain has this amazing ability

24:10.160 --> 24:11.600
 to control what's going on in the body

24:11.600 --> 24:14.400
 in ways that we don't think we have ability to control.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.880
 That's just one example.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.440
 So that's the DLPFC-insula connection.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.880
 The third thing that happens,

24:19.880 --> 24:22.960
 and this relates to what you did on the stage,

24:22.960 --> 24:26.520
 is you have inverse functional connectivity

24:26.520 --> 24:30.960
 between the DLPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.400
 The posterior cingulate is part of the default mode network.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.280
 It's in the back of the brain.

24:36.280 --> 24:39.360
 And it's an area whose activity goes down,

24:39.360 --> 24:41.400
 for example, in meditators.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.680
 And in meditation you're supposed to be selfless.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.280
 You're supposed to, the self is an illusion.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.440
 You're supposed to let it dissolve

24:46.440 --> 24:47.880
 and just experience things.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.240
 And when you're doing that, the posterior cingulate

24:50.240 --> 24:52.200
 is decreasing in activity.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.400
 The inverse connection is I'm doing something

24:55.400 --> 24:57.960
 but I'm not thinking about what it means for me.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.000
 I may not even remember much of it.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.480
 If I do, I don't care that much about it.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.680
 And so that is part of the dissociation

25:05.680 --> 25:06.920
 that occurs with hypnosis.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.880
 So it's how you put things outside of conscious awareness

25:09.880 --> 25:11.520
 and don't worry about what it means.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.360
 It also adds to cognitive flexibility.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.560
 If you're thinking, well, people like me

25:16.560 --> 25:19.320
 don't usually do this, that may inhibit you

25:19.320 --> 25:23.080
 from enacting a new form of psychotherapy, for example,

25:23.080 --> 25:25.120
 that you've never done before.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.080
 But if you're having this decreased activity

25:28.080 --> 25:31.160
 in the part of your brain that reflects on what it means,

25:31.160 --> 25:33.440
 you're more likely to be cognitively flexible

25:33.440 --> 25:34.640
 and willing to give it a try.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.640
 And that's one of the therapeutic advantages

25:36.640 --> 25:38.600
 of hypnosis as well.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.440
 Fascinating.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.760
 And it's really, I'm gonna put,

25:41.760 --> 25:43.680
 I'm gonna embarrass you here a little bit

25:43.680 --> 25:45.160
 in the positive sense.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.800
 Your laboratory is really the one that's pioneered

25:47.800 --> 25:49.720
 brain imaging of hypnotic states.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.600
 And it sounds like that's my understanding.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.520
 Is that correct?

25:53.520 --> 25:54.360
 Yeah.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.200
 I mean, there are other people

25:55.200 --> 25:56.680
 who've done excellent research too,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.880
 but Pierre Rainville in Montreal and several other people,

25:59.880 --> 26:01.680
 but we're one of the leading lamps

26:01.680 --> 26:04.280
 in neuroimaging of hypnosis.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.160
 I have to ask about attention deficit

26:07.160 --> 26:08.640
 hyperactivity disorder.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.120
 I get a lot of questions about this

26:11.120 --> 26:12.760
 and I think a lot of people just struggle

26:12.760 --> 26:15.000
 with holding attention nowadays

26:15.000 --> 26:18.960
 because of interference with phones and devices.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.640
 And of course there is a lot

26:20.640 --> 26:23.080
 of clinically legitimate ADHD out there,

26:23.080 --> 26:25.600
 but the way that you describe the dorsal

26:25.600 --> 26:27.920
 and the anterior cingulate and the salience network

26:27.920 --> 26:32.080
 and this conflict detector of am I focusing on something

26:32.080 --> 26:33.520
 or am I splitting my attention?

26:33.520 --> 26:36.440
 How distractible am I seems to relate to some extent

26:36.440 --> 26:40.720
 to activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.840
 Do people with ADHD display disruptions

26:44.840 --> 26:46.480
 in elements of these networks

26:46.480 --> 26:50.200
 and has hypnosis ever been used to,

26:51.160 --> 26:53.080
 or self-hypnosis I should be,

26:53.080 --> 26:55.000
 to distinguish from stage hypnosis,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.960
 clinical and self-hypnosis has been used

26:56.960 --> 27:00.720
 to enhance people's ability to focus and hold attention

27:00.720 --> 27:02.800
 because that's such a built-in component

27:02.800 --> 27:04.000
 of the hypnotic state.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.360
 It's a great question.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.880
 There's sort of two ways to think about it.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.040
 In terms of enhancing focus, yes,

27:11.040 --> 27:14.520
 it has been very helpful in teaching people

27:14.520 --> 27:16.720
 to just prepare your mind to narrow in

27:16.720 --> 27:18.200
 and focus on something.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.560
 And when you're really engaged in reading something

27:20.560 --> 27:22.400
 or you're writing a, I mean, I'll have that,

27:22.400 --> 27:24.200
 sometimes I'm thinking, oh, God,

27:24.200 --> 27:25.560
 I have to do this for another hour.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.880
 Other times, an hour will go by and I'll think,

27:27.880 --> 27:30.040
 hey, great, because when you're in the,

27:30.040 --> 27:31.680
 it feels game-like to you.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.960
 You're just assembling the parts of the puzzle

27:33.960 --> 27:35.680
 and putting them together.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.520
 It's fun.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.440
 You just get absorbed.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.480
 For me, that's a hypnotic-like experience.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.800
 When I'm having trouble, when I'm struggling,

27:41.800 --> 27:45.080
 sometimes doing things like self-hypnosis can help.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.680
 I'm not an expert on ADHD.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.440
 My impression is that you're right

27:49.440 --> 27:52.320
 that these are people who are constantly distracted

27:52.320 --> 27:53.720
 and rather rigid.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.800
 The other part of it is they're easily distractible.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.360
 They're very upset when they get distracted

27:58.360 --> 28:00.560
 and they're rather rigid in what they want to attend to

28:00.560 --> 28:01.600
 and what they can't, I think,

28:01.600 --> 28:04.740
 as a way of controlling this distractibility, frankly.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.400
 My guess is that many people with ADHD

28:08.400 --> 28:09.940
 would not be that hypnotizable,

28:09.940 --> 28:11.480
 but I haven't studied it.

28:11.480 --> 28:16.480
 So it's possible that for some people with that disorder,

28:17.240 --> 28:18.880
 training in self-hypnosis might help,

28:18.880 --> 28:21.160
 but we'd have to see how hypnotizable they were

28:21.160 --> 28:23.120
 and take it from there.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.120
 I want to return to some of the underlying neural networks

28:26.120 --> 28:28.200
 and the clinical applications,

28:28.200 --> 28:32.240
 but what sorts of things,

28:32.240 --> 28:34.880
 aside from the asthma,

28:34.880 --> 28:39.360
 have you used hypnosis successfully for,

28:39.360 --> 28:43.220
 or have others used clinical hypnosis for?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.840
 And are there any particular areas

28:45.840 --> 28:49.520
 of psychiatric challenges or illnesses,

28:49.520 --> 28:51.020
 I guess they're called,

28:51.020 --> 28:56.020
 that are particularly amenable to hypnotic treatment?

28:56.380 --> 28:57.400
 Yes, there are.

28:57.400 --> 29:02.400
 Hypnosis is very good as a problem-focused treatment.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.400
 It's really, it's the oldest Western conception

29:05.400 --> 29:06.840
 of a psychotherapy,

29:06.840 --> 29:09.080
 and it can be used for specific problems

29:09.080 --> 29:10.840
 in a way that's very helpful.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.420
 We found it very helpful for stress reduction,

29:13.420 --> 29:14.500
 for helping people deal,

29:14.500 --> 29:17.200
 we're all dealing with stress these days.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.660
 And it's helpful,

29:18.660 --> 29:20.600
 that mind-body connection is very helpful

29:20.600 --> 29:23.840
 because part of the problem with stress

29:23.840 --> 29:25.520
 is your perception,

29:25.520 --> 29:27.520
 you mentioned it earlier in a sort of good sense,

29:27.520 --> 29:29.400
 you're at a football game or something

29:29.400 --> 29:32.000
 and you feel the physical reaction.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.960
 That can be a reinforcing thing.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.820
 Wow, this is exciting, let's do it.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.540
 It can also be very distracting.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.400
 So you're worried about getting COVID

29:40.400 --> 29:45.160
 or you're worried about some other physical problem you have

29:45.160 --> 29:46.840
 and you notice it in your body.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.560
 Your body tenses up, you start to sweat,

29:49.560 --> 29:51.600
 the sympathetic nervous system goes,

29:51.600 --> 29:53.120
 your heart rate goes up.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.740
 And when you notice that,

29:54.740 --> 29:57.040
 you think, oh God, this is really bad.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.140
 And then you feel worse.

29:58.140 --> 30:00.760
 So it's like a snowball rolling downhill

30:00.760 --> 30:03.800
 and then you feel worse and then your body gets worse.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.440
 Hypnosis can be very helpful

30:05.440 --> 30:09.240
 in dissociating somatic reaction from psychological reaction

30:09.240 --> 30:12.380
 so we teach people to imagine their body floating

30:12.380 --> 30:14.760
 somewhere safe and comfortable like a bath, a lake,

30:14.760 --> 30:16.440
 a hot tub or floating in space.

30:16.440 --> 30:20.200
 And then picture the problem that's stressing them

30:20.200 --> 30:21.720
 on an imaginary screen with the rule

30:21.720 --> 30:23.180
 that no matter what you see on the screen,

30:23.180 --> 30:24.760
 you keep your body comfortable.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.820
 So at this point, you still can't control the stress

30:27.820 --> 30:30.640
 but you can control your physical reaction to it.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.000
 And that starts you feeling more in control.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.560
 At least there's one thing I can manage.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.360
 And then you can use it to think through

30:36.360 --> 30:38.760
 or visualize through one thing you might do

30:38.760 --> 30:39.680
 about that stressor.

30:39.680 --> 30:43.320
 So hypnosis is very helpful in controlling mind-body

30:43.320 --> 30:45.440
 interaction in relation to stress.

30:46.380 --> 30:49.520
 It's very helpful for people to get to sleep.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.760
 We're having a lot of fun with that.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.200
 I'm getting emails from people who said,

30:54.200 --> 30:56.000
 I haven't slept right in 15 years

30:56.000 --> 30:59.660
 and now for the first time, I'm listening to your app

30:59.660 --> 31:01.480
 and I can sleep at night.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.640
 So it's very helpful.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.840
 And again, if you wake up in the middle of the night,

31:07.440 --> 31:09.060
 I tell people, don't look at the clock.

31:09.060 --> 31:10.400
 That's an arousal cue.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.080
 You'll just wake up more.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.200
 But picture whatever you're thinking about

31:16.200 --> 31:18.120
 or worrying about on that imaginary screen

31:18.120 --> 31:19.060
 while your body's floating.

31:19.060 --> 31:21.960
 So watch your own movie, but keep your body floating.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.660
 And many people can use that to get back to sleep.

31:24.660 --> 31:27.660
 I've been using the self-hypnosis for sleep

31:27.660 --> 31:29.400
 for a long time.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.520
 And now the Reverie app, and we'll talk about

31:31.520 --> 31:33.640
 our relationship to the Reverie app and its uses.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.620
 I find it incredibly useful for falling back asleep

31:36.620 --> 31:38.600
 in the middle of the night.

31:38.600 --> 31:43.320
 And it raises a question I've found,

31:43.320 --> 31:45.080
 and I think I understand this correctly,

31:45.080 --> 31:49.920
 that one can do self-hypnosis during the daytime.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.200
 And then if there's an issue that comes up later,

31:52.200 --> 31:55.480
 like so for instance, do self-hypnosis for stress reduction

31:55.480 --> 31:58.160
 away from the stressful event to prepare one

31:58.160 --> 31:59.520
 to deal with stress better.

31:59.520 --> 32:03.880
 Or do a hypnosis for improving the return to sleep.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.280
 And that can be done when you actually want to go to sleep,

32:06.280 --> 32:09.920
 but it's kind of a training up of these networks, right?

32:09.920 --> 32:10.800
 That's right.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.240
 So is there evidence that these brain networks

32:14.240 --> 32:17.440
 actually form stronger connections

32:17.440 --> 32:19.780
 when people do self-hypnosis over time?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.380
 Well, there's a rule in neurobiology, as you know,

32:23.380 --> 32:25.480
 that neurons that fire together wire together.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.560
 Our friend, Carla Schatz.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.400
 Yes, Carla.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.640
 Not Donald Hebb, by the way.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.560
 I keep trying to, there's a widespread myth in the world

32:32.560 --> 32:34.920
 that is unfortunately all over the internet,

32:34.920 --> 32:36.920
 which is that the word fire together, wire together

32:36.920 --> 32:39.100
 was said by the psychologist Donald Hebb.

32:39.100 --> 32:41.000
 Donald had many important things,

32:41.000 --> 32:44.320
 but it is the neurobiologist, Carla Schatz.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.400
 That's exactly right.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.160
 Yes, is at Stanford, but was also at Berkeley and Harvard.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.920
 So also decent schools.

32:51.240 --> 32:55.280
 But is at Stanford who said fire together, wire together.

32:55.280 --> 32:58.520
 And so she deserves the credit for that statement.

32:58.520 --> 33:02.140
 Yeah, so with repeated use of self-hypnosis,

33:03.040 --> 33:06.200
 one could imagine that these networks are getting stronger.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.720
 I would think so.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.080
 We don't have evidence of that yet,

33:10.080 --> 33:15.080
 but long-term potentiation provides a pathway,

33:16.240 --> 33:18.860
 and you've described them on your program a number of times,

33:18.860 --> 33:22.060
 that allow for repeated activation of a network

33:22.060 --> 33:25.240
 to actually build new connections that work.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.480
 And at the least,

33:26.480 --> 33:28.920
 even from a learning and memory point of view,

33:28.920 --> 33:32.640
 our memory is all a network of associations.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.760
 That's how we remember things.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.920
 And the example I'd like to give

33:36.920 --> 33:39.240
 is you go back to your grade school,

33:39.240 --> 33:41.520
 and you see these little tiny lockers,

33:41.520 --> 33:43.360
 and the size is all wrong,

33:43.360 --> 33:45.280
 and you suddenly have a flood of memories

33:45.280 --> 33:47.520
 that were obviously stored there,

33:47.520 --> 33:48.560
 but you just didn't think of.

33:48.560 --> 33:52.360
 So context and association is what memory is about.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.360
 If you start to acquire memories about a problem,

33:55.360 --> 33:57.320
 so one thing we use hypnosis for

33:57.320 --> 33:59.160
 is treating phobias, for example.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.100
 And the problem with people who have phobias,

34:01.100 --> 34:04.640
 like airplane phobias, or crossing a bridge,

34:04.640 --> 34:08.240
 or being up high, is that the more they avoid it,

34:08.240 --> 34:11.840
 the more the only source of associations and memories

34:11.840 --> 34:12.920
 is their fear.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.840
 They don't have any good experiences with it

34:14.840 --> 34:16.240
 because they avoid it.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.400
 It's like get back on the horse

34:17.400 --> 34:19.280
 after you fall off kind of thing.

34:19.280 --> 34:24.280
 And with hypnosis, if you can start people able

34:24.280 --> 34:26.280
 to manage their anxiety enough

34:26.280 --> 34:29.680
 that they can have more, a wider array of experiences,

34:29.680 --> 34:32.280
 they start to have a network of associations

34:32.280 --> 34:34.720
 that isn't so negative and may even be positive.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.800
 So it's almost like a, sorry to interrupt,

34:36.800 --> 34:40.800
 but I have to ask, it's almost like a exposure therapy

34:40.800 --> 34:42.960
 done in the mind.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.200
 I mean, it's always in the mind.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.760
 I mean, even exposure to, if I have a snake phobia,

34:46.760 --> 34:48.740
 which I don't, I don't like snakes,

34:48.740 --> 34:51.280
 but I don't think it qualifies as a full-blown phobia.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.800
 I think I have a healthy fear of snakes.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.640
 But if, let's say I had a snake phobia,

34:57.640 --> 35:02.440
 the typical approach would be cognitive behavioral

35:02.440 --> 35:03.280
 approaches, right?

35:03.280 --> 35:04.800
 Would be to show a picture of a snake

35:04.800 --> 35:06.280
 or then a rubber snake, then a real snake.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.160
 Eventually the person is holding a boa constrictor

35:09.160 --> 35:10.960
 or something like that.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.520
 That's all in the mind because it's all translated

35:13.520 --> 35:14.720
 into nervous system signals.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.280
 But with hypnosis, sounds like you can give

35:17.280 --> 35:19.280
 a number of positive experiences

35:19.280 --> 35:21.480
 without having to use any props,

35:21.480 --> 35:23.960
 without having to bring any animals into the room

35:23.960 --> 35:25.360
 to drive someone across the bridge.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.200
 Is that right?

35:26.200 --> 35:27.040
 Yes.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.760
 I had a woman who was a very successful businesswoman,

35:29.760 --> 35:31.920
 high level in a corporation.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.560
 I had a terrible dog phobia.

35:33.560 --> 35:37.200
 And so I had her imagine that somebody brought in

35:37.200 --> 35:39.280
 a dog to the room and I said, what are you doing?

35:39.280 --> 35:41.280
 And you could see her getting tense.

35:41.280 --> 35:44.320
 And she said, well, I'm waiting to see what the dog does.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.520
 And I said, if somebody who works for you

35:46.520 --> 35:48.440
 comes into your office, would you freeze

35:48.440 --> 35:50.440
 and wait to see what they did?

35:50.440 --> 35:51.680
 And she said, of course not.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.120
 And I tell them what to do, you know.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.560
 And I said, well, so you're immobilizing yourself.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.960
 The power isn't with the dog, it's with you.

35:58.960 --> 36:01.720
 So imagine what you might do to engage the dog

36:01.720 --> 36:04.360
 and help control the situation.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.360
 And she said, thanks.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.320
 And this reminds me of one of my favorite stories

36:08.320 --> 36:12.000
 about hypnosis that my father was seeing a woman

36:12.000 --> 36:13.240
 who lived in Midtown Manhattan

36:13.240 --> 36:14.960
 and had a horrible dog phobia.

36:14.960 --> 36:18.440
 She'd drop things, she'd spill coffee, she saw a dog.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.520
 She would time her trips to the store

36:20.520 --> 36:21.960
 when she thought it was least likely

36:21.960 --> 36:23.200
 that people would be walking dogs.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.360
 Now that wouldn't be possible.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.440
 Everyone, it's like a fleet of French bulldogs

36:28.440 --> 36:30.800
 taking over New York City.

36:30.800 --> 36:35.040
 So he taught her to think of a dog as a friend,

36:35.040 --> 36:38.840
 have a neighbor who had a dog, bring the dog over,

36:38.840 --> 36:41.400
 but hold the dog by the collar and make sure.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.200
 And gradually she was able to stroke the dog

36:44.200 --> 36:45.680
 and say, dog friend, and distinguish

36:45.680 --> 36:47.120
 between wild and tame animals.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.280
 There are animals, you should be afraid of this.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.520
 So she seemed to be doing better.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.040
 He called back about three months later

36:53.040 --> 36:56.360
 and asked for her and said, well, who's calling?

36:56.360 --> 36:58.760
 The son said, and he said, Dr. Spiegel.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.000
 And the boy said, that's weird.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.400
 And my father said, what's weird?

37:02.400 --> 37:04.240
 He said, Spiegel's in heat.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.520
 She had bought a dog and named it Spiegel.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.760
 Talk about transference.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.160
 I love it.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.480
 But it really speaks to the power of this.

37:13.480 --> 37:18.120
 And it brings me back to this issue.

37:18.120 --> 37:22.200
 So what is different about what your father did

37:22.200 --> 37:25.560
 in that case with this woman,

37:25.560 --> 37:29.080
 in terms of what happened in hypnosis

37:29.080 --> 37:31.440
 that allowed her to go from being completely terrified

37:31.440 --> 37:35.680
 of dogs to owning a dog and naming it after your father,

37:35.680 --> 37:36.800
 which I find amusing.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.600
 But that's different than just the two of them

37:40.600 --> 37:43.120
 sitting down and talking about it, right?

37:43.120 --> 37:47.480
 In therapy, the narrative is a huge component

37:47.480 --> 37:50.240
 and in hypnosis, narrative is a huge component.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.360
 So it must be that the brain state

37:53.360 --> 37:54.600
 is what is really different,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.360
 because we'll talk about trauma in a few minutes,

37:57.360 --> 38:01.680
 but I think people who have trauma or phobias

38:01.680 --> 38:06.160
 certainly could have a conversation about it.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.360
 Some of them might freeze up.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.960
 Some of them might lose their articulation and so forth.

38:09.960 --> 38:13.160
 But what is different about that state

38:13.160 --> 38:15.560
 that combines with narrative you think

38:15.560 --> 38:18.160
 to allow these underlying neural networks

38:18.160 --> 38:20.080
 to engage her to change?

38:20.080 --> 38:21.600
 Because I find this so fascinating

38:21.600 --> 38:26.600
 because every attempt at dealing with stress or phobia

38:26.720 --> 38:28.920
 in the clinical setting involves some discussion

38:28.920 --> 38:30.360
 about what it is.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.160
 But here we're not talking about any medication

38:33.160 --> 38:34.000
 being introduced,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.160
 at least not in these particular circumstances.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.880
 So I just, I realized it's kind of an obvious question

38:39.880 --> 38:42.600
 like it has to be some difference in brain activity,

38:42.600 --> 38:44.800
 but I find that to be incredible.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.120
 The control variable there is the brain state.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.480
 It's not what's spoken.

38:51.360 --> 38:54.480
 You're raising a couple of very important issues, Andrew.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.160
 We talked earlier about systematic desensitization

38:59.160 --> 39:02.680
 where you sort of lay out a hierarchy of things

39:02.680 --> 39:04.200
 and do it one at a time.

39:04.200 --> 39:07.400
 I think of this as unsystematic desensitization

39:07.400 --> 39:10.360
 because you're changing mental states.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.360
 And I think there's more and more evidence

39:12.360 --> 39:15.320
 that mental state change itself has therapeutic potential.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.960
 We're seeing that with ketamine,

39:16.960 --> 39:19.440
 treating depression as a sociogenic drug.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.680
 We see it, we know it every morning

39:22.680 --> 39:24.360
 when we wake up that problem.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.320
 You made the mistake of reading a nasty email at 11 p.m.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.400
 You didn't know what to do.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.280
 You wake up in the morning and think,

39:29.280 --> 39:31.720
 oh, that idiot, yeah, here's what I'm gonna do.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.560
 So just changing mental state itself

39:34.560 --> 39:36.000
 has therapeutic potential.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.880
 And I think we underestimate our ability

39:38.880 --> 39:41.360
 to regulate and change responses,

39:41.360 --> 39:46.360
 to be cognitively, emotionally, and somatically flexible.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.520
 And so we do things, you're right,

39:48.520 --> 39:51.440
 that follow similar principles of facing a problem,

39:51.440 --> 39:53.440
 seeing it from a different point of view.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.960
 And you've done a really nice podcast on trauma and stress

39:56.960 --> 40:00.680
 and how you have to expose yourself to it, not avoid it,

40:00.680 --> 40:02.360
 as we talked about before,

40:02.360 --> 40:06.240
 and then find some way to reconnect to it,

40:06.240 --> 40:08.640
 to substitute something that can make you feel good

40:08.640 --> 40:12.520
 rather than bad so that you activate other centers

40:12.520 --> 40:15.120
 of the brain, like mesolimbic reward system.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.520
 And so I do that with hypnosis,

40:17.520 --> 40:19.960
 and you can do it much faster.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.880
 People don't think they can, but they can.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.680
 If you're having, right now, that physical experience,

40:24.680 --> 40:25.520
 I'm thinking about this,

40:25.520 --> 40:28.960
 but I'm not feeling as bad as I used to,

40:28.960 --> 40:30.520
 that can be a powerful thing,

40:30.520 --> 40:32.040
 and you can do it with hypnosis.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.840
 So I had a woman came to see me

40:34.840 --> 40:36.840
 who had suffered an attempted rape.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.440
 It was getting dark.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.160
 She was coming back from the grocery store,

40:40.160 --> 40:41.760
 and this guy grabs her

40:41.760 --> 40:43.640
 and wants to get her up into her apartment.

40:43.640 --> 40:44.680
 It's outside her apartment.

40:44.680 --> 40:47.080
 And she starts fighting with him,

40:47.080 --> 40:49.680
 and she winds up with a basilar skull fracture.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.280
 He runs away.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.600
 The cops come.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.120
 Since she hadn't been raped, they left.

40:54.120 --> 40:54.960
 They weren't interested.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.920
 And she wanted to use hypnosis

40:56.920 --> 40:59.400
 to get a better image of what this guy looked like,

40:59.400 --> 41:01.160
 which is a painful, upsetting thing.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.480
 So she was quite hypnotizable.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.680
 I got her floating.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.120
 I say, you're safe and comfortable now.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.440
 Nothing can happen that will harm your body.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.360
 But on the left side of the screen,

41:10.360 --> 41:12.440
 I want you to picture this guy

41:12.440 --> 41:14.600
 and his approaching and what's happening.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.440
 And she said, the light, it was getting dark.

41:17.440 --> 41:20.240
 I really can't see much of his facial features,

41:20.240 --> 41:21.800
 but I do recognize something

41:21.800 --> 41:24.000
 I hadn't allowed myself to remember.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.640
 If he gets me upstairs, he doesn't just wanna rape me.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.200
 He's gonna kill me.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.480
 And so in some ways,

41:30.480 --> 41:31.800
 what she was seeing was even worse.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.160
 So you're thinking good Spiegel.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.000
 You made her even more frightened than she was before.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.600
 But as you had pointed out in your PTSD stress lecture,

41:40.600 --> 41:42.240
 you've got to confront the trauma

41:42.240 --> 41:45.440
 to restructure your understanding of it.

41:45.440 --> 41:48.400
 So on the other side of the screen, I had her picture.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.040
 What are you doing to protect yourself?

41:53.040 --> 41:54.840
 And everybody in a trauma situation

41:54.840 --> 41:57.560
 engages in some strategy of self-protection.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.840
 That's the Salience Network kicking in.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.560
 And she said, you know what?

42:02.560 --> 42:05.000
 He's surprised and I'm fighting that hard.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.720
 He didn't think I would.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.640
 And so she realized on the one hand

42:08.640 --> 42:10.560
 that it was even worse than she thought it was.

42:10.560 --> 42:11.440
 But on the other hand,

42:11.440 --> 42:13.760
 that she actually probably saved her life.

42:13.760 --> 42:17.480
 And so it was a way of helping her restructure

42:17.480 --> 42:20.640
 her experience of the trauma and make it more tolerable.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.280
 So that helped with her.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.200
 She didn't recognize, she couldn't identify the guy,

42:25.200 --> 42:29.080
 but it helped her restructure and understand her experience.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
 And that's something that you can do

42:31.080 --> 42:33.840
 in just talking straight out psychotherapy,

42:33.840 --> 42:36.600
 but sometimes you can do a hell of a lot faster

42:36.600 --> 42:39.160
 and more efficiently using hypnosis.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.640
 And there is one randomized trial out of Israel

42:41.640 --> 42:44.120
 that shows that adding hypnosis to PTSD treatment

42:44.120 --> 42:46.120
 actually improves outcome.

42:46.120 --> 42:51.120
 So it's a way of accomplishing things that we understand

42:52.280 --> 42:54.120
 in the broader psychotherapy world,

42:54.120 --> 42:58.360
 but much more quickly and sometimes effectively.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.560
 Yeah, it sounds like going into,

42:59.560 --> 43:03.120
 somewhat into the state that one is trying to deal with,

43:03.120 --> 43:05.560
 but then dissociating from that state is key.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.960
 And I could imagine,

43:06.960 --> 43:09.320
 and I've been open about this on various podcasts.

43:09.320 --> 43:13.160
 I've done a lot of analysis over the years.

43:13.160 --> 43:17.400
 So, but I've experienced myself that in those sessions,

43:17.400 --> 43:19.120
 depending on how I show up to them,

43:19.120 --> 43:22.280
 I might just get in kind of a laundry list of what happened

43:22.280 --> 43:24.080
 as opposed to actually feeling anything

43:24.080 --> 43:25.120
 around what happened.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.680
 And I think people probably varied

43:27.680 --> 43:30.760
 in the extent to which they can drop into feeling states

43:30.760 --> 43:33.240
 and it can depend on the day.

43:33.240 --> 43:36.080
 It can depend on how well you slept the night before

43:36.080 --> 43:37.360
 and so on.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.880
 There's one thing I might add, Andrew,

43:38.880 --> 43:40.640
 and that is, you know, there's a notion

43:40.640 --> 43:41.960
 of the late Gordon Bauer.

43:41.960 --> 43:45.240
 We just had a memorial for Gordon at Stanford.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.120
 He died about a year ago.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.960
 Brilliant cognitive psychologist.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.200
 So one of the founders of cognitive psychology at Stanford

43:52.200 --> 43:53.280
 and a great pitcher.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.400
 He almost became a major league pitcher,

43:55.400 --> 43:57.420
 but he decided to go to grad school instead.

43:57.420 --> 43:58.720
 And I'm glad he did.

43:59.920 --> 44:03.080
 But Gordon helped establish the concept

44:03.080 --> 44:04.440
 of state-dependent memory,

44:04.440 --> 44:07.140
 that when you're in a certain mental state,

44:07.140 --> 44:09.200
 you enhance your ability to remember things about it.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.120
 And the sort of the bad example of that

44:11.120 --> 44:12.800
 is the drunk who hides the bottle

44:12.800 --> 44:14.160
 and can't remember where he put it

44:14.160 --> 44:15.240
 until he gets drunk again.

44:15.240 --> 44:18.220
 That he's in that same mental state.

44:18.220 --> 44:22.480
 People go into dissociative states when they're traumatized.

44:22.480 --> 44:26.080
 So in a way, hypnosis is helping them remember

44:26.080 --> 44:27.360
 and deal with the memories better

44:27.360 --> 44:29.400
 because they're more in the mental state

44:29.400 --> 44:30.560
 that is more like what happened.

44:30.560 --> 44:32.880
 And most rape victims will tell you,

44:32.880 --> 44:35.240
 I was floating above my body feeling sorry

44:35.240 --> 44:37.420
 for the woman being assaulted below.

44:39.660 --> 44:42.240
 People in traumatic episodes, they just say,

44:42.240 --> 44:43.120
 you know, I blank out.

44:43.120 --> 44:43.960
 I don't know what's happening.

44:43.960 --> 44:44.960
 I'm on autopilot.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.320
 And that's a kind of self-hypnotic state.

44:47.320 --> 44:50.520
 So when you use hypnosis to help them deal

44:50.520 --> 44:51.960
 with the traumatic memory,

44:51.960 --> 44:53.900
 you're making the state they're in right there

44:53.900 --> 44:56.460
 in your office with you more congruent

44:56.460 --> 44:59.200
 to the state they were likely in when the trauma happened.

44:59.200 --> 45:02.620
 And I think that is part of what helps facilitate treatment

45:02.620 --> 45:04.600
 of trauma-related disorders.

45:04.600 --> 45:05.840
 I see.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.400
 So that makes me have to ask every question I have to ask

45:09.400 --> 45:11.840
 because I really feel it as almost a compulsion.

45:11.840 --> 45:15.680
 Then if dissociation during a traumatic episode

45:15.680 --> 45:19.200
 is part of the adaptive strategy,

45:20.080 --> 45:21.440
 but it creates certain issues.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.940
 It creates problems, right?

45:22.940 --> 45:27.220
 Why would something like ketamine,

45:27.220 --> 45:29.820
 which creates a dissociative state,

45:29.820 --> 45:32.300
 be useful for the treatment of trauma?

45:32.300 --> 45:34.580
 This is what I'm confused about these days

45:34.580 --> 45:36.700
 because our colleague, Carl Deisseroth,

45:36.700 --> 45:38.060
 who's also been on this podcast

45:38.060 --> 45:40.460
 and his coworkers have figured out,

45:40.460 --> 45:43.740
 okay, there's these layer one networks in the neocortex,

45:43.740 --> 45:45.380
 and those are involved in dissociative state.

45:45.380 --> 45:46.680
 And so we're starting to gain some understanding

45:46.680 --> 45:49.420
 of how ketamine works at a neural level.

45:49.420 --> 45:52.760
 It does seem as if for certain populations,

45:52.760 --> 45:54.860
 it can be a useful treatment.

45:54.860 --> 45:55.900
 I don't know, I've never tried it.

45:55.900 --> 45:57.420
 I don't know what the current status of that is,

45:57.420 --> 45:58.740
 but it is legal.

45:58.740 --> 46:03.280
 It is allowed, at least it's FDA approved and it's in use.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.840
 Why would dissociative states be useful

46:06.840 --> 46:10.860
 if some element of dissociation is what gave rise

46:10.860 --> 46:13.600
 to the trauma memory in the first place?

46:13.600 --> 46:16.660
 Well, yeah, Carl had a brilliant paper in Nature

46:16.660 --> 46:20.180
 where it was from rats to humans in one paper.

46:20.180 --> 46:22.820
 And he showed that there's this rhythmic discharge

46:22.820 --> 46:26.260
 in the retrosplenial region that is associated,

46:26.260 --> 46:28.060
 that is triggered by ketamine.

46:28.060 --> 46:31.960
 And the rats actually showed dissociative-like behavior

46:31.960 --> 46:34.100
 in that they would touch a hot pad

46:34.100 --> 46:35.280
 that they ordinarily wouldn't,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.340
 and they didn't seem to have much pain in their paw.

46:37.340 --> 46:40.500
 And he then had a male subject

46:40.500 --> 46:43.100
 who had implanted electrodes.

46:43.100 --> 46:43.940
 Human.

46:43.940 --> 46:45.580
 A human subject, yeah, human subject.

46:45.580 --> 46:50.580
 And the electrodes had picked up this rhythmic activity,

46:50.700 --> 46:52.740
 and when they did, he would report

46:52.740 --> 46:54.100
 being in a dissociative state.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.760
 And his description was,

46:55.760 --> 46:57.780
 it's like being a pilot of an airplane,

46:57.780 --> 47:00.560
 and then I felt myself walking out of the cockpit,

47:00.560 --> 47:01.820
 and the plane was still flying.

47:01.820 --> 47:03.900
 That sounds terrifying to me.

47:03.900 --> 47:05.140
 That sounds terrifying.

47:05.140 --> 47:07.500
 I want to be in my body most of the time.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.340
 That's right, but the point is,

47:11.340 --> 47:13.060
 in a way, the principle, Andrew,

47:13.060 --> 47:14.500
 is like the principle you said,

47:14.500 --> 47:17.900
 that you need to re-confront a traumatic situation

47:17.900 --> 47:21.280
 before you can modulate your associations to it.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.800
 So you have to accept it, accept the arousal,

47:24.620 --> 47:25.860
 put some boundaries around it,

47:25.860 --> 47:28.300
 and then figure out how you can approach that problem,

47:28.300 --> 47:29.820
 or how you did approach that problem

47:29.820 --> 47:31.300
 from a different point of view.

47:31.300 --> 47:32.980
 So it does not surprise,

47:32.980 --> 47:36.020
 in fact, we've studied people who dissociated

47:36.020 --> 47:38.100
 during the Loma Prieta earthquake

47:38.100 --> 47:40.380
 and the Oakland-Berkeley firestorm.

47:40.380 --> 47:41.900
 I remember both of those well.

47:41.900 --> 47:42.820
 Earthquakes follow me.

47:42.820 --> 47:45.020
 And then I move south, and then the northridge.

47:45.020 --> 47:45.860
 I'm going to keep it right here.

47:45.860 --> 47:47.180
 So there'll be one layer this afternoon.

47:47.180 --> 47:50.380
 I'm starting to dissociate, Andrew.

47:50.380 --> 47:55.300
 So dissociation does compartmentalize experience,

47:55.300 --> 47:58.100
 but that means, from the point of view of treating trauma,

47:58.100 --> 48:00.380
 it's an inhibition.

48:00.380 --> 48:01.500
 You don't engage it.

48:01.500 --> 48:02.980
 It's like it happened over there.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.740
 And I think what happens is that people

48:05.740 --> 48:08.740
 are sometimes too good at being able to separate themselves

48:08.740 --> 48:11.540
 from the recollection, so it's in there somewhere.

48:11.540 --> 48:13.320
 It's out of sight, but it's not out of mind.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.660
 It's having effects on you, but you can't deal with it.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.300
 You can't reprocess it.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.820
 So I do think one reason ketamine might work

48:20.820 --> 48:25.500
 is that, in fact, it allows you to keep,

48:25.500 --> 48:29.060
 to re-approach the dissociative experience

48:29.060 --> 48:31.020
 in a way that you can then start to think about

48:31.020 --> 48:32.060
 and do something about it.

48:32.060 --> 48:34.380
 And just the fact you can turn it on and off.

48:34.380 --> 48:37.540
 And that's also where self-hypnosis is so helpful.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.340
 It's not something that just comes over you

48:39.340 --> 48:41.540
 and happens to you, it's something you can make happen.

48:41.540 --> 48:42.420
 You can control it.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.820
 You can do something with it.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.500
 So you feel less helpless and out of control.

48:46.500 --> 48:48.380
 The essence of trauma is helplessness.

48:48.380 --> 48:50.940
 It's not fear, it's not pain, it's helplessness.

48:50.940 --> 48:52.580
 You become an object.

48:52.580 --> 48:54.140
 You become just your body.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.480
 You don't control what's going on,

48:55.480 --> 48:57.200
 and we're not used to that.

48:57.200 --> 49:00.340
 You and I have discussed this brilliant paper

49:00.340 --> 49:02.460
 on anticipation of breathing,

49:02.460 --> 49:04.300
 and it's not whether you breathe,

49:04.300 --> 49:06.780
 inhale or exhale or hold your breath.

49:06.780 --> 49:10.260
 It's that if you think you can inhale and you can't,

49:10.260 --> 49:12.660
 that is really upsetting, understandably.

49:12.660 --> 49:15.020
 And so the issue is control.

49:15.020 --> 49:18.080
 And hypnosis, which has this terrible reputation

49:18.080 --> 49:21.820
 of taking away control, is actually a superb way

49:21.820 --> 49:24.460
 of enhancing your control over mind and body.

49:25.700 --> 49:26.540
 I love that.

49:26.540 --> 49:29.100
 And it reminds me that naming is so important.

49:29.100 --> 49:32.600
 You almost wonder if self-hypnosis and clinical hypnosis

49:32.600 --> 49:34.540
 had been called something else,

49:34.540 --> 49:38.220
 that it would have been separated out from stage hypnosis

49:38.220 --> 49:43.220
 in a way that would make it less scary, weird,

49:44.260 --> 49:46.700
 complicated for people to embrace.

49:46.700 --> 49:49.420
 But part of the reason for having this discussion

49:49.420 --> 49:52.380
 is I've had great experiences with hypnosis.

49:52.380 --> 49:54.180
 I've seen the data.

49:54.180 --> 49:55.700
 We're talking about a lot of clinical examples.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.240
 It's incredibly powerful,

49:57.240 --> 50:01.340
 and it boils right down to neural brain states.

50:01.340 --> 50:03.760
 And I think in the years to come,

50:03.760 --> 50:06.740
 it's going to become more widespread.

50:06.740 --> 50:09.300
 Along those lines, how quickly,

50:09.300 --> 50:11.700
 you've described some examples

50:11.700 --> 50:14.740
 of people getting relief very quickly.

50:14.740 --> 50:17.540
 How permanent are those changes?

50:18.380 --> 50:20.200
 Is there a need for follow-up?

50:20.200 --> 50:21.560
 And related to that,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.180
 I'm sure a number of people are listening to this

50:23.180 --> 50:26.220
 and thinking, wonderful, I'd love to get hypnotized

50:26.220 --> 50:29.660
 for any number of different things by Dr. Spiegel

50:29.660 --> 50:32.380
 or somebody else expert in clinical hypnosis,

50:32.380 --> 50:36.140
 but they might not have access to you or somebody

50:36.140 --> 50:37.420
 with similar training.

50:37.420 --> 50:39.220
 So what is the power?

50:39.220 --> 50:40.940
 So how quickly does it work?

50:40.940 --> 50:43.000
 How long lasting are those changes?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.980
 And then is it necessary to work with a clinical hypnotist?

50:46.980 --> 50:49.760
 And is it better to do that than self-hypnosis

50:49.760 --> 50:50.700
 and so on and so forth?

50:50.700 --> 50:53.620
 Maybe you could just give us a contour of the landscape

50:53.620 --> 50:56.220
 of directed and self-directed treatment.

50:56.220 --> 51:01.020
 Well, typically most people start

51:01.020 --> 51:03.220
 by coming to see a clinician like me.

51:03.220 --> 51:06.580
 It's better to see someone who has licensing and training

51:06.580 --> 51:08.700
 in their professional discipline,

51:08.700 --> 51:11.860
 medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever.

51:11.860 --> 51:13.220
 Because there are a lot of hypnotists out there

51:13.220 --> 51:14.260
 who are just hypnotists.

51:14.260 --> 51:15.460
 Just hypnotists.

51:15.460 --> 51:16.300
 Okay.

51:16.300 --> 51:18.920
 And the key issue is somebody who can really assess

51:18.920 --> 51:20.420
 what your problem is and make sure

51:20.420 --> 51:21.740
 that you're not talking someone

51:21.740 --> 51:22.980
 into reducing their chest pain

51:22.980 --> 51:26.240
 rather than getting their coronary artery problem.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.580
 Because they could have a real issue there.

51:27.580 --> 51:28.420
 They could, right.

51:28.420 --> 51:31.380
 Hypnosis might adjust but wouldn't deal

51:31.380 --> 51:33.140
 with the deeper underlying issue.

51:33.140 --> 51:33.980
 That's right.

51:33.980 --> 51:37.060
 On the other hand, and typically when I use it with people,

51:37.060 --> 51:39.700
 I often only see them once or twice or periodically

51:39.700 --> 51:41.020
 but not every week.

51:41.020 --> 51:43.340
 And certainly not every day if they have a pain problem.

51:43.340 --> 51:46.580
 And hypnosis is very helpful for pain.

51:46.580 --> 51:51.040
 And so what I'm doing is identifying

51:51.040 --> 51:52.220
 how hypnotizable they are.

51:52.220 --> 51:53.900
 I give them a standard brief test

51:53.900 --> 51:55.860
 of their ability to experience hypnosis.

51:55.860 --> 51:58.860
 And then going through a self-hypnosis exercise

51:58.860 --> 52:00.480
 with them to deal with the problem.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.180
 Seeing how they respond to it.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.940
 And then teaching them how to do it for themselves.

52:04.940 --> 52:06.980
 And in the old days I used to have them

52:06.980 --> 52:11.980
 use their iPhone and record that part of the session

52:12.040 --> 52:15.020
 so they could play back the hypnosis experience.

52:15.020 --> 52:18.100
 Now we've developed an app, Reverie,

52:18.100 --> 52:22.740
 that can teach people and step them through

52:22.740 --> 52:27.460
 dealing with pain, stress, focus, insomnia,

52:27.460 --> 52:31.500
 and help people eat better and stop smoking.

52:31.500 --> 52:35.240
 And we have elements that take about 15 minutes

52:35.240 --> 52:37.120
 and elements that just take one or two minutes

52:37.120 --> 52:39.220
 that people can refresh and reinforce.

52:39.220 --> 52:40.420
 So the idea- Two minute hypnosis.

52:40.420 --> 52:41.500
 Yes, yes.

52:41.500 --> 52:44.620
 And it's one to two minutes now.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.620
 And we're finding that two thirds of the people

52:46.620 --> 52:49.700
 find that even just the one minute refresher

52:49.700 --> 52:50.820
 helps them feel better.

52:50.820 --> 52:52.060
 They're reporting they feel better.

52:52.060 --> 52:53.940
 So the nice thing is you know right away

52:53.940 --> 52:56.780
 whether it's likely to help you or not.

52:56.780 --> 53:00.500
 And we've found, we've done studies looking at hypnosis

53:00.500 --> 53:03.340
 for pain relief in acute medical procedures.

53:03.340 --> 53:06.580
 We did a randomized trial that we published in The Lancet.

53:06.580 --> 53:10.000
 Three conditions, people getting arterial cut downs

53:10.000 --> 53:12.420
 to chemoembolized tumors in the liver

53:12.420 --> 53:14.740
 or visualized renal artery stenosis.

53:14.740 --> 53:16.340
 You don't use general anesthesia for this.

53:16.340 --> 53:18.420
 It's very uncomfortable and people are anxious.

53:18.420 --> 53:19.700
 And we had three conditions.

53:19.700 --> 53:22.340
 One was standard care, they could push a button

53:22.340 --> 53:24.940
 and get opioids, IV.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.940
 Is during the surgery.

53:25.940 --> 53:26.780
 During the surgery.

53:26.780 --> 53:28.240
 The second is they could do that

53:28.240 --> 53:30.660
 plus they had a friendly nurse comforting them.

53:30.660 --> 53:33.500
 So we controlled for pleasant attention and support.

53:33.500 --> 53:35.760
 And the third was we taught them self hypnosis

53:35.760 --> 53:36.600
 for pain control.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.500
 So you're feeling, you can change the temperature.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.620
 Your body is cool, tingling and numb.

53:41.620 --> 53:44.580
 You're floating in ice water and feeling comfortable.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.060
 Or go somewhere else.

53:47.060 --> 53:49.740
 Leave your body here and go to a desert island

53:49.740 --> 53:51.780
 and enjoy yourself.

53:51.780 --> 53:55.900
 And we found that it's about two and a half hour procedure

53:55.900 --> 53:59.740
 that by an hour and a half, the hypnosis group

53:59.740 --> 54:02.960
 had reduced their pain by 80%

54:02.960 --> 54:04.780
 compared to the standard care group

54:04.780 --> 54:07.140
 using half the amount of opioids.

54:07.140 --> 54:09.060
 They had fewer complications

54:09.060 --> 54:12.380
 and the procedure took 17 minutes less time on average

54:12.380 --> 54:14.660
 to get done because not only was the patient more relaxed,

54:14.660 --> 54:15.880
 so was the treatment staff.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.580
 They weren't dealing with someone

54:17.580 --> 54:19.540
 who was struggling and uncomfortable.

54:19.540 --> 54:21.220
 We measured their anxiety.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.740
 And same thing, the hypnosis group,

54:22.740 --> 54:23.940
 I was worried they were all dead.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.980
 They had no anxiety after an hour and a half.

54:25.980 --> 54:27.660
 They were saying I'm fine, you know.

54:27.660 --> 54:28.980
 And they were fine.

54:28.980 --> 54:32.100
 And the standard care group had five out of 10

54:32.100 --> 54:33.860
 anxiety scores at that point.

54:33.860 --> 54:36.280
 So we published that in The Lancet.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.460
 Big randomized trial.

54:38.460 --> 54:40.860
 If we had a drug that did that,

54:40.860 --> 54:44.300
 every hospital in the country would be using it now.

54:44.300 --> 54:46.300
 But there's no industry to push it.

54:46.300 --> 54:48.880
 So that's part of what helped us decide

54:48.880 --> 54:52.700
 that we needed to help people do this with Reverie

54:52.700 --> 54:54.060
 and teach them how to do it

54:54.060 --> 54:57.820
 and provide interactive support for them to do it.

54:57.820 --> 55:01.980
 And the question, although, is does it work long term?

55:01.980 --> 55:03.460
 Because what we can do acutely

55:03.460 --> 55:05.080
 doesn't necessarily carry on.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.700
 So we did a randomized trial of women

55:07.700 --> 55:09.000
 with metastatic breast cancer.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.940
 They had advancing disease.

55:10.940 --> 55:13.000
 We met with them in a support group once a week

55:13.000 --> 55:16.660
 and taught them self-hypnosis for stress and anxiety

55:16.660 --> 55:18.100
 and pain control at the end.

55:18.100 --> 55:20.660
 And by the end of a year,

55:20.660 --> 55:23.120
 the treatment group had half the pain the control group did

55:23.120 --> 55:25.580
 on the same and very low amounts of medication.

55:25.580 --> 55:26.500
 So it lasts.

55:26.500 --> 55:29.820
 And they would say when I felt that pain in my chest

55:29.820 --> 55:32.980
 and thought it was a metastasis, I just did the exercise.

55:32.980 --> 55:35.620
 I got myself in a warm bath and I felt fine.

55:35.620 --> 55:40.620
 So it works because it becomes a skill that people acquire.

55:40.660 --> 55:42.040
 But they can tell right away

55:42.040 --> 55:44.660
 whether it's likely to help them working with a clinician

55:44.660 --> 55:48.900
 or now using the app or other ways of helping them learn

55:48.900 --> 55:50.100
 to use it as a skill.

55:50.100 --> 55:52.960
 So the nice thing is you will know very quickly

55:52.960 --> 55:54.420
 whether it's likely to help you or not.

55:54.420 --> 55:57.100
 And if it is, you can learn to do it for yourself.

55:57.100 --> 55:57.940
 That's great.

55:57.940 --> 56:00.760
 And we will, again, there'll be a link to Reverie

56:00.760 --> 56:04.100
 in the caption that's available for Apple and Android.

56:04.100 --> 56:07.400
 And I think even though there's a nominal cost there,

56:07.400 --> 56:12.320
 I think that, as you mentioned, medications

56:12.320 --> 56:14.900
 and other approaches to dealing with these problems

56:14.900 --> 56:18.960
 are quite expensive and have all the potential

56:18.960 --> 56:20.220
 for side effects and things.

56:20.220 --> 56:22.120
 Not that some of those aren't also useful.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.300
 Could I, before you get to that, just one thing.

56:24.300 --> 56:27.060
 We've worked very hard on the app.

56:27.060 --> 56:29.620
 We have an iOS app for Apple.

56:29.620 --> 56:33.500
 We decided to table for a moment redoing the Android app.

56:33.500 --> 56:37.860
 So it's not, it was available when we were working

56:37.860 --> 56:39.660
 through the Alexa platform.

56:39.660 --> 56:41.780
 It's not at the moment, but it will be soon.

56:41.780 --> 56:44.020
 So I just don't want people to be disappointed

56:44.020 --> 56:45.660
 if they're looking for it for Android.

56:45.660 --> 56:48.700
 It's on our agenda, but we don't have it at the moment.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.300
 Great, thanks for that clarification.

56:50.300 --> 56:52.440
 So hopefully in time for both.

56:53.300 --> 56:56.680
 I get asked a lot about obsessive thoughts

56:56.680 --> 56:58.700
 or intrusive thoughts.

56:58.700 --> 57:01.300
 I also get asked a lot about OCD.

57:01.300 --> 57:04.300
 Is there any evidence that hypnosis or self-hypnosis

57:04.300 --> 57:07.060
 can be used for dealing with obsessive thoughts?

57:09.620 --> 57:10.460
 Sometimes.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.500
 There are some very obsessional people

57:12.500 --> 57:15.300
 who just turn out not to be that hypnotizable,

57:15.300 --> 57:16.300
 and it's not random.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.420
 They tend to be so over-controlling of thought.

57:19.420 --> 57:23.000
 They're all busy evaluating rather than experiencing.

57:23.000 --> 57:23.840
 So in some ways-

57:23.840 --> 57:24.660
 I know a few people like that.

57:24.660 --> 57:26.020
 I mean, me too.

57:26.020 --> 57:28.920
 Sounds like a, it sounds like an adaptive mindset

57:28.920 --> 57:31.380
 for a lot of professions in areas,

57:31.380 --> 57:34.900
 and that we get trained up in that during school,

57:34.900 --> 57:36.620
 how to obsess over the exam,

57:36.620 --> 57:40.280
 obsess over our social interactions.

57:40.280 --> 57:42.560
 I mean, it's part of becoming a functional human being,

57:42.560 --> 57:45.260
 and yet you can take us down a different-

57:45.260 --> 57:46.420
 We sometimes overdo it.

57:46.420 --> 57:50.100
 I mean, I'll tell you one example from extreme situations,

57:50.100 --> 57:52.820
 because you're judging, evaluating,

57:52.820 --> 57:54.180
 you're not letting yourself experience,

57:54.180 --> 57:55.700
 including emotionally.

57:55.700 --> 57:59.820
 I know somebody who listens to the tapes from airplanes

57:59.820 --> 58:01.940
 that they go down, so they get the black box

58:01.940 --> 58:04.780
 and they listen to it, and he said to me, you know-

58:04.780 --> 58:06.260
 That's his profession, or he does this recreationally?

58:06.260 --> 58:09.420
 No, it's his profession, that's what he did,

58:09.420 --> 58:11.220
 because they're trying to do accident prevention

58:11.220 --> 58:12.420
 and how to handle things.

58:12.420 --> 58:17.420
 And he said that you worry about people panicking, right?

58:17.420 --> 58:20.740
 And here, these guys know that they've got 30 seconds,

58:20.740 --> 58:22.100
 or some 45 seconds,

58:22.100 --> 58:24.500
 and they're just going through their checklist.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.980
 He said they don't panic enough.

58:26.980 --> 58:28.840
 They're taught that this is what you do,

58:28.840 --> 58:31.360
 and there is reason, there's good reason for it,

58:31.360 --> 58:33.580
 but sometimes they overdo it.

58:33.580 --> 58:36.340
 And it's painful to listen to this,

58:36.340 --> 58:37.500
 because you know what's going to happen.

58:37.500 --> 58:40.260
 So it's kind of a balance we have to hit,

58:40.260 --> 58:43.540
 and sometimes we get too emotional and too absorbed,

58:43.540 --> 58:46.140
 and you're not with it enough

58:46.140 --> 58:48.260
 to sort of see other possibilities.

58:48.260 --> 58:49.100
 That can be a problem.

58:49.100 --> 58:51.380
 But on the other hand, sometimes you're too rigid

58:51.380 --> 58:54.460
 and controlled, and you don't let your emotions guide you

58:54.460 --> 58:56.820
 to what you need to do to protect yourself

58:56.820 --> 58:57.660
 or protect others.

58:57.660 --> 59:01.860
 So I would say in general that people with OCD

59:01.860 --> 59:05.840
 are on the less hypnotizable side of the spectrum.

59:05.840 --> 59:07.580
 They're less likely to allow themselves

59:07.580 --> 59:08.460
 to engage in anything.

59:08.460 --> 59:11.260
 And the typical example is the checking with OCD,

59:11.260 --> 59:12.180
 for example.

59:12.180 --> 59:17.020
 They don't remember whether they locked the door

59:17.020 --> 59:18.380
 or turned off the gas in the oven,

59:18.380 --> 59:20.100
 and they keep going back, and they keep checking.

59:20.100 --> 59:23.560
 So there, the evaluative component of the brain

59:23.560 --> 59:26.140
 kind of overrides the experiential one.

59:26.140 --> 59:29.340
 And sometimes people can get some benefit,

59:29.340 --> 59:32.420
 but they're not a group that I would select

59:32.420 --> 59:35.100
 for being the most likely to respond

59:35.100 --> 59:37.140
 to self-hypnotic approaches.

59:37.140 --> 59:39.060
 Are superstitions similar?

59:40.460 --> 59:44.240
 Superstitions, I think that's more.

59:44.240 --> 59:47.740
 There are people who are very hypnotizable

59:47.740 --> 59:51.060
 who keep getting caught up in things like superstitions.

59:51.060 --> 59:55.220
 And there, the imagination supplants the reality.

59:55.220 --> 59:58.120
 And we've seen a lot of that happening recently.

59:58.120 --> 1:00:02.180
 And so I think there it's possible

1:00:02.180 --> 1:00:05.260
 that they could be helped by learning to sort of see it,

1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:06.980
 but put it in context,

1:00:06.980 --> 1:00:09.020
 see it from a different point of view.

1:00:09.020 --> 1:00:11.080
 I developed a pretty vicious superstition

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:14.820
 when I was in college, and it was hard to break, actually.

1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:16.900
 I always feel that when I talk to clinicians,

1:00:16.900 --> 1:00:19.860
 I have to reveal certain things about my own pathology.

1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:21.340
 You'll get my bill later.

1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:23.620
 Yes, it's part of the reason I arranged this,

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:24.460
 I'm just kidding.

1:00:24.460 --> 1:00:25.300
 But yeah, I did.

1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:28.180
 I had a habit of knocking on wood for things,

1:00:28.180 --> 1:00:29.720
 and I noticed it started to,

1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:35.500
 I would sneak knocking on wood every once in a while,

1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:37.340
 because I didn't want people to think I was doing too often.

1:00:37.340 --> 1:00:38.180
 And then I started to realize

1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:41.420
 that it was becoming a little bit of a reflex.

1:00:41.420 --> 1:00:43.780
 And then I saw this incredible video

1:00:43.780 --> 1:00:45.840
 from Ben Solevsky's lab at Harvard.

1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:47.500
 He studies motor patterns.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.760
 He has these rats that press different sequences

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:54.420
 of levers and turn dials in order to get a pellet of food.

1:00:54.420 --> 1:00:55.460
 But that as they do that,

1:00:55.460 --> 1:00:56.980
 they'll start to introduce these behaviors

1:00:56.980 --> 1:00:59.900
 that have nothing to do with the actual lever pressing.

1:00:59.900 --> 1:01:02.180
 They'll start scratching their hindquarters

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:04.600
 and things like that, and their head,

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:06.700
 excuse me, they don't wear hats, and flipping their ears.

1:01:06.700 --> 1:01:10.900
 And this is just like a pitcher before throwing a baseball.

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:15.180
 We do this, we start to incorporate motor behaviors

1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:17.200
 that are unrelated to the outcome,

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:19.700
 but our mind somehow starts to think

1:01:19.700 --> 1:01:21.600
 that they're necessary for the outcome.

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:22.660
 And so then you incorporate it.

1:01:22.660 --> 1:01:25.020
 So I decided to break it by simply forcing myself

1:01:25.020 --> 1:01:26.860
 to not do it for about a week.

1:01:26.860 --> 1:01:29.780
 And then it just seemed like a ridiculous thing to do.

1:01:29.780 --> 1:01:30.860
 Knock on wood.

1:01:30.860 --> 1:01:33.420
 We call it response prevention, and it works.

1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:36.780
 Because what you do is you set up a new context

1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:39.580
 in your brain where you get the outcome you want

1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:43.040
 devoid of the extraneous behavior.

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:44.800
 And I knew it was nuts, right?

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:46.300
 I knew it was illogical,

1:01:46.300 --> 1:01:49.720
 but somehow these things take on meaning.

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:51.460
 So we talked about stress reduction,

1:01:51.460 --> 1:01:55.220
 the utility of hypnosis for stress reduction,

1:01:55.220 --> 1:01:58.860
 phobias, pain, possibly, we don't know,

1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:01.580
 but for things like ADHD and OCD,

1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:03.980
 it just will depend on hypnotizability.

1:02:04.980 --> 1:02:06.640
 You talked about this beautiful study

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:11.640
 on the metastatic breast cancer outcome or patients.

1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:16.020
 Hypnotizability is clearly a key variable.

1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:20.700
 So could you please tell us what hypnotizability is,

1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:25.060
 how it's evaluated, and what the Spiegel eye roll test is?

1:02:25.060 --> 1:02:25.880
 Okay, sure.

1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:30.880
 So hypnotizability is just a capacity

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:33.220
 to have hypnotic experiences.

1:02:33.220 --> 1:02:35.920
 And we have a test called the hypnotic induction profile,

1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:39.540
 where we give a highly structured hypnotic experience.

1:02:39.540 --> 1:02:42.620
 And you know, the old tradition in clinical hypnosis

1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:45.060
 was that you try a bunch of different things,

1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:48.460
 walking upstairs and downstairs and other images,

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:51.600
 and time what you say to the breathing of the subject

1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:52.440
 and all that.

1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:55.860
 And the more you change what you do as a clinician,

1:02:55.860 --> 1:02:59.020
 the less you can make a variation in outcome.

1:02:59.020 --> 1:03:00.820
 And it could take a long time, you know,

1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:02.820
 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:05.900
 And I just view that as a kind of complex,

1:03:05.900 --> 1:03:07.620
 not very effective way of assessing

1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:09.700
 the person's hypnotic capacity.

1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:13.120
 We know that the peak period of hypnotizability

1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:16.180
 in the human life is the latency years in childhood.

1:03:16.180 --> 1:03:19.060
 So every eight-year-old is in a trance all the time.

1:03:19.060 --> 1:03:20.220
 You know, you call them in for dinner,

1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:21.940
 they don't hear you, they're doing their thing.

1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:24.500
 And that's why childhood is such a wonderful experience.

1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:26.980
 Work and play are all the same thing, you know.

1:03:26.980 --> 1:03:29.060
 And we try to make them into little adults,

1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:30.860
 which I think is a terrible mistake.

1:03:30.860 --> 1:03:32.500
 They, everything is fun for them.

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:34.660
 They enjoy learning, they enjoy everything.

1:03:34.660 --> 1:03:36.780
 So what age are they in this?

1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:40.180
 This is like six to 10, six to 11.

1:03:40.180 --> 1:03:42.400
 They're playful, they enjoy everything.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:44.600
 Everything is sort of a game and fun.

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:46.420
 And we try to make it miserable for them,

1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:47.940
 but they've got it.

1:03:47.940 --> 1:03:51.500
 And then when what Piaget called, you know,

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:53.640
 a more adult cognitive framework,

1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:56.260
 where we learn abstract concepts,

1:03:56.260 --> 1:03:58.740
 we learn that even if one bottle looks bigger than the other

1:03:58.740 --> 1:04:00.000
 they can have equal volume.

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.040
 And so we start imposing logic.

1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:04.760
 We're growing our DLPFC at that point,

1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:07.920
 and imposing cognitive structure on experience.

1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:12.380
 Some people start to lose that hypnotic ability.

1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:14.780
 By the time you're in your early 20s,

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:19.900
 your hypnotized ability becomes extremely fixed.

1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:22.540
 And there was a study done at Stanford,

1:04:22.540 --> 1:04:24.940
 Ernest Hilgard, Phil Zimbardo did this,

1:04:24.940 --> 1:04:29.940
 looking at, they tracked down students who were in Psych 1,

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:32.780
 had their hypnotized ability measured,

1:04:32.780 --> 1:04:35.740
 and retested them blindly 25 years later.

1:04:35.740 --> 1:04:38.160
 And the test-retest correlation was,

1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:40.200
 you want to guess what it was?

1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:44.840
 I'm guessing it's, I don't know, 0.6 something.

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:46.120
 Yeah, very close.

1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:50.200
 It was 0.7, IQ would be 0.6 on a 25 year interval.

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:53.120
 So it's more stable than IQ over a 25 year interval.

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:57.020
 So once you're at that point, that's where you are.

1:04:57.020 --> 1:04:59.520
 What are the factors that lead to that?

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:02.500
 Well, and so what it means is that about a third of adults

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:04.240
 are just not hypnotizable.

1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:07.720
 Two thirds are, about 15% are extremely hypnotizable.

1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:09.320
 And we can measure that and give it a number

1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:11.020
 from zero to 10.

1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:12.340
 And that's very useful.

1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:14.320
 For some of my patients when I do it,

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:16.120
 I say, look, I'm sorry, you're not hypnotizable,

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:17.780
 we're gonna do something else.

1:05:17.780 --> 1:05:20.520
 Medication, systematic desensitization,

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.720
 mindfulness, other things.

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.880
 Or if they're very hypnotizable, I just go for it.

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.520
 I don't do a lot of explaining.

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:30.080
 People who are low to moderate hypnotizable

1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:31.920
 like explanations about what you're doing,

1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:34.120
 but then they can still get the benefits.

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.200
 So it helps me guide the nature of my treatment

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:39.040
 with these people.

1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:40.760
 Now, the eye roll is,

1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:45.280
 my father used to use an eye fixation induction.

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:47.920
 He used to say, look up at the ceiling

1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:50.920
 and now close your eyes while you're looking up.

1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:53.560
 You're very, yes, you're very hypnotizable.

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:57.520
 So he noticed, he had two patients back to back.

1:05:57.520 --> 1:05:59.560
 And one was a woman who I'd seen him work with

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:01.920
 who had hysterical seizures.

1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:05.000
 She would just suddenly start shaking.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.360
 Real epileptic seizures.

1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:07.520
 No, pseudo epileptics.

1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:08.960
 I see, so hysteria.

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:09.800
 Hysteria.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:11.360
 And although some people have both,

1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:13.600
 that is for some people,

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:15.880
 real epilepsy becomes a framework

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.840
 that gets elaborated on for when you're stressed,

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:19.680
 you have seizures.

1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:23.080
 She just had pseudo epilepsy, no EEG abnormalities.

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:25.280
 And she, it was really something to watch.

1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:29.040
 Her husband had to move his workbench near the door

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:30.440
 so that if she started to have a seizure,

1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:32.600
 he could run home and try and help her with it.

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:34.040
 It was that bad.

1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:38.040
 And he noticed that when she did what you did,

1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:39.560
 when she looked up, when she would have

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:42.360
 one of her seizure events, all you see is sclera.

1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:44.280
 You don't see iris anymore.

1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:45.440
 And she would start to see.

1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:47.600
 So he did a great thing with her.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:49.040
 He taught her to have seizures.

1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:51.160
 Everybody else was telling her to stop.

1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:52.040
 He made her have one.

1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:53.040
 So he hypnotized her.

1:06:53.040 --> 1:06:54.760
 Let's go back to the last time you had one.

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:56.360
 And sure enough, she'd start to shake.

1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:59.480
 And gradually, he'd make them smaller and smaller.

1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:00.480
 So she was learning.

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:01.360
 She could control.

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:02.260
 She'd have access.

1:07:02.260 --> 1:07:03.960
 It's like with PTSD.

1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:05.640
 You confront, you don't avoid it.

1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:06.760
 You don't suppress it.

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:09.480
 You confront it and figure out how to deal with it.

1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:11.800
 The next patient he had

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:14.560
 was a rigid, obsessional businessman

1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:19.560
 who wanted to stop being so controlling and all this.

1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:22.080
 Remind me, there was a New Yorker cartoon of a driver

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:25.040
 who comes to a yield sign and he yells, never.

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:26.880
 It's always being controlled.

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:27.720
 Sounds about right.

1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:28.540
 You're a New Yorker.

1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:30.280
 I'm a New Yorker, right.

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:34.040
 And so this guy, when he tried to look up,

1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:36.240
 he couldn't keep his eyes up while he closed them.

1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:40.480
 And so my father started testing people.

1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:43.420
 And it seemed that there is a rough correlation

1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:45.420
 between the capacity to keep your eyes up

1:07:45.420 --> 1:07:48.360
 while you close them and measured hypnotizability.

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.960
 So that people who are listening

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:53.080
 and watching on video.

1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:55.880
 So the Spigot eye roll test involves looking up

1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:56.720
 at the ceiling.

1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:57.600
 So it's tilting the head back.

1:07:57.600 --> 1:07:59.740
 I'm tilting my chin back and looking up at the ceiling now.

1:07:59.740 --> 1:08:04.040
 But I'm also directing my eyes upward and my eyes are open.

1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:07.560
 And then the eye roll test involves then

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.520
 closing the eyelids while the eyes are open.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:13.160
 And whether or not the eyes roll back.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:15.960
 And as you said, then you see sclera, the white part.

1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:16.800
 You see sclera, the white part.

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:18.700
 That means you're very hypnotizable

1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:20.400
 or moderately hypnotizable.

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:22.800
 Whereas if the eyes move down and you see iris,

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:25.280
 the colored part of the eye, as the eyes close,

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:27.080
 less hypnotizable.

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:28.520
 And you can look this up online there.

1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:32.880
 You just put Spigot eye roll test and you'll find it.

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:36.240
 And we are also gonna do an actual example

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:38.560
 of hypnosis on video later.

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:42.600
 Right, so you're asking the brain to do something difficult

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:46.840
 to keep the eyes up while closing the eyelids.

1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:49.880
 And so that's contradictory signals for the third,

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.580
 fourth, and sixth cranial nerve nuclei

1:08:51.580 --> 1:08:53.620
 that control eye movement.

1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:54.480
 You said the third?

1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:57.400
 Fourth and sixth cranial nerve nuclei.

1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:02.400
 And so you're suspending one activity while asking them

1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:05.860
 to do another, and eye movements have a lot to do

1:09:05.860 --> 1:09:07.460
 with levels of consciousness.

1:09:07.460 --> 1:09:09.820
 The periaqueductal gray surrounds

1:09:09.820 --> 1:09:11.740
 these cranial nerve nuclei.

1:09:11.740 --> 1:09:15.460
 And when we close our eyes when we sleep,

1:09:15.460 --> 1:09:17.520
 we have rapid eye movement when we dream.

1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:19.520
 Most drugs that affect level of consciousness

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.380
 can affect eyes and eye movements,

1:09:21.380 --> 1:09:24.260
 either the dilation or contraction of the pupils,

1:09:24.260 --> 1:09:27.220
 depending on whether it's a stimulant or an opioid.

1:09:27.220 --> 1:09:29.100
 Stimulants make the pupils big.

1:09:29.100 --> 1:09:29.940
 Right.

1:09:29.940 --> 1:09:31.740
 Yeah, like cocaine, amphetamine.

1:09:31.740 --> 1:09:32.560
 Right, exactly.

1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:33.400
 Things of that sort.

1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:36.740
 And opioids, you get constricted pupils.

1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:37.940
 This is what parents, you know,

1:09:37.940 --> 1:09:39.100
 the parents looking at their kids

1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:40.460
 coming in the door late at night,

1:09:40.460 --> 1:09:44.060
 they're looking for substance abuse.

1:09:44.060 --> 1:09:44.900
 That's right.

1:09:44.900 --> 1:09:47.540
 So there's something about the eyes

1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:49.500
 that has a lot to do with level of consciousness.

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:52.220
 I mean, obviously, you close your eyes when you go to sleep,

1:09:52.220 --> 1:09:54.500
 you have rapid eye movement when you're dreaming.

1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:56.060
 So it's not surprising.

1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:57.800
 And there's an old Zen practice

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.860
 called looking at the third eye.

1:09:59.860 --> 1:10:02.860
 And I think part of the reason that this happens

1:10:02.860 --> 1:10:05.460
 is where you're looking up inside.

1:10:05.460 --> 1:10:06.520
 It's like there's a third eye

1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:08.700
 between the other two in your forehead.

1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:12.300
 And I think it's because we're visual creatures.

1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:14.500
 You know, we're pretty pathetic

1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:15.660
 from a physical point of view.

1:10:15.660 --> 1:10:18.580
 You know, many animals can outrun us, you know,

1:10:19.780 --> 1:10:21.580
 or outsmell us or see, you know,

1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:24.900
 eagles could read the newsprint at 100 yards

1:10:24.900 --> 1:10:26.460
 and we can't, you know, it's.

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:31.460
 So our major defensive sensory input is vision.

1:10:32.980 --> 1:10:36.860
 And that's why, you know, animals, predator animals

1:10:36.860 --> 1:10:38.300
 have eyes in the front of their head

1:10:38.300 --> 1:10:42.200
 so that they have very good detailed vision of prey,

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:44.500
 whereas prey animals like deer

1:10:44.500 --> 1:10:45.900
 have eyes on the side of their head.

1:10:45.900 --> 1:10:47.140
 So they don't see things that well,

1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:49.300
 but they have a much bigger range

1:10:49.300 --> 1:10:52.560
 of potential to see threat.

1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:55.660
 And we mainly use, and in fact, it's interesting,

1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:57.500
 there have been social anthropologists that say,

1:10:57.500 --> 1:11:01.180
 why do we gather where we do, you know, on coastlines

1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:03.940
 and, you know, at the edge of a forest or something?

1:11:03.940 --> 1:11:06.500
 It's because you've got protection in the back.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:08.540
 Something can't attack you from one side

1:11:08.540 --> 1:11:11.340
 and you have a big vision of what might threaten you.

1:11:11.340 --> 1:11:13.380
 And we tend to like be attracted

1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:16.460
 to those kinds of physical situations.

1:11:16.460 --> 1:11:17.280
 So.

1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:18.120
 And we love vistas.

1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:18.940
 We love vistas.

1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:19.780
 Vistas are very calming.

1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:21.480
 They take us into that panoramic vision.

1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:22.320
 That's right.

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:23.540
 I didn't know this, but it turns out

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:26.860
 that most of the scenic spots at any location

1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:30.260
 in national parks were where people naturally aggregated.

1:11:30.260 --> 1:11:32.820
 It wasn't, which makes sense, you know,

1:11:32.820 --> 1:11:35.860
 but that those signs and locations

1:11:35.860 --> 1:11:38.220
 were built up around people's tendency

1:11:38.220 --> 1:11:41.700
 and animals' tendencies to aggregate there.

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:43.620
 Yeah, there's an interesting book

1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:44.860
 on the history of the national parks

1:11:44.860 --> 1:11:48.020
 that says that they didn't give a research study

1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:50.540
 to support it, but there was no Google maps, obviously.

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:51.580
 That's very interesting.

1:11:51.580 --> 1:11:54.380
 Yeah, panorama and visual boundaries

1:11:54.380 --> 1:11:55.380
 are really interesting.

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:57.900
 I think, so the eyes, as we both know,

1:11:57.900 --> 1:12:00.020
 are two pieces of the central nervous system

1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:02.340
 of the brain outside the,

1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:04.540
 I used to say that the eyes are outside the skull

1:12:04.540 --> 1:12:08.780
 and a neuro-ophthalmologist wrote to me

1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:11.340
 and vehemently pointed out

1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:13.380
 that they are outside the cranial vault.

1:12:13.380 --> 1:12:15.820
 So, you know, they're outside the cranial vault,

1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:16.940
 but they are two pieces of brain.

1:12:16.940 --> 1:12:17.860
 They're out there.

1:12:17.860 --> 1:12:21.020
 And so you mentioned cranial nerves, three, four, and six.

1:12:21.020 --> 1:12:22.380
 This isn't a neuroanatomy course,

1:12:22.380 --> 1:12:24.580
 but maybe we could go a little deeper there.

1:12:24.580 --> 1:12:26.660
 So there's, you said there's contradictory activity.

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:31.500
 Looking up is controlled by the one set of cranial nerves

1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:32.820
 and then the closing of the eyelids

1:12:32.820 --> 1:12:35.780
 is controlled by another cranial nerve.

1:12:35.780 --> 1:12:36.940
 No, it's the same one.

1:12:36.940 --> 1:12:41.940
 I think it's six that when you close your eyes,

1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:46.540
 you activate, no, it's the facial,

1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:47.740
 I guess it's the facial nerve.

1:12:47.740 --> 1:12:50.220
 It's seven, seven, yeah.

1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:52.380
 But you're looking up,

1:12:52.380 --> 1:12:54.500
 you're activating the muscles

1:12:55.380 --> 1:12:58.100
 that force your eyes to look up

1:12:58.100 --> 1:13:02.660
 and closing your eyelids normally relaxes those,

1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:04.260
 relaxes that upper movement

1:13:04.260 --> 1:13:06.720
 because your eyes are closed and you don't need to do it.

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:10.020
 So you're breaking a usual customary pattern.

1:13:10.020 --> 1:13:12.180
 It's like the rubbing, hey, I can't even do it.

1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:13.180
 See, it's like the,

1:13:14.700 --> 1:13:17.180
 rubbing your tummy and patting your head.

1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:19.140
 There's a bit of a conflict there.

1:13:19.140 --> 1:13:22.060
 But clinically it's been a good probe for you

1:13:22.060 --> 1:13:23.340
 and for your father.

1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:25.380
 So was it Spiegel Senior or Spiegel Junior?

1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:26.340
 That's Spiegel Senior.

1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:28.740
 That developed the Spiegel Eye Roll Test.

1:13:28.740 --> 1:13:30.100
 But the key issue is this,

1:13:30.100 --> 1:13:32.980
 that normally when we close our eyes also,

1:13:32.980 --> 1:13:34.340
 we're going to sleep.

1:13:34.340 --> 1:13:36.060
 You're not worried about what's going on

1:13:36.060 --> 1:13:37.020
 in the world anymore.

1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:40.180
 Here, you're maintaining resting alertness.

1:13:40.180 --> 1:13:42.980
 So you're focusing, but you're turning inward.

1:13:42.980 --> 1:13:44.300
 That's an unusual state.

1:13:44.300 --> 1:13:46.620
 Normally we close our eyes periodically.

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.380
 We have to, but when you close your eyes

1:13:49.380 --> 1:13:51.820
 for some period of time, it's normally to go to sleep.

1:13:51.820 --> 1:13:56.740
 And you're not worried about detecting risk or threat.

1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:58.660
 So it's an interesting state

1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:01.180
 because you're turning inward basically.

1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:03.300
 You're looking up, you're shutting your eyes

1:14:03.300 --> 1:14:05.820
 and you're allowing whatever happens outside you to happen

1:14:05.820 --> 1:14:08.220
 and focusing on what's going on inward.

1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:12.020
 So I think it's a signal to your brain to turn inward.

1:14:12.020 --> 1:14:13.380
 Very interesting.

1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:16.460
 And meditation of course could be done with eyes open,

1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:18.580
 but almost always is done with eyes closed.

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:20.100
 Yes, that's right.

1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:21.340
 Very interesting.

1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:24.020
 So you can very quickly determine

1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:27.220
 whether or not someone is highly hypnotizable,

1:14:27.220 --> 1:14:28.180
 not at all hypnotized.

1:14:28.180 --> 1:14:31.580
 When you say about two thirds of people can be hypnotized,

1:14:31.580 --> 1:14:32.780
 obviously a third cannot,

1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:35.980
 but within the two thirds that can, there's a range.

1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:37.860
 And you said 15% of people fall

1:14:37.860 --> 1:14:40.780
 into this highly hypnotizable category

1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:42.780
 that I seem to be a member of.

1:14:42.780 --> 1:14:46.020
 And does repeated use of self-hypnosis

1:14:46.020 --> 1:14:49.260
 or clinical hypnosis increase or change hypnotizability

1:14:49.260 --> 1:14:51.380
 for those that can access it in the first place?

1:14:51.380 --> 1:14:53.900
 I would say in general, it may increase a little bit,

1:14:53.900 --> 1:14:55.060
 but not a hell of a lot.

1:14:55.060 --> 1:14:57.020
 And it's not worth the effort

1:14:57.020 --> 1:14:59.340
 to increase your hypnotizability at that point.

1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:01.100
 It's worth trying to deal with the problem

1:15:01.100 --> 1:15:02.100
 you're dealing with.

1:15:02.100 --> 1:15:04.420
 So you can get better at using it

1:15:04.420 --> 1:15:06.860
 at the level that you have.

1:15:06.860 --> 1:15:09.860
 There was a study done in which they tried to train people

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:11.100
 to be more hypnotizable.

1:15:11.100 --> 1:15:14.300
 And obviously there are subjective

1:15:14.300 --> 1:15:16.740
 and behavioral components to the test.

1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:18.860
 You can learn to do a little better on them.

1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:22.460
 But what we found was when we reanalyzed this data,

1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:25.580
 that we could account for three times the final score

1:15:25.580 --> 1:15:28.580
 based on the initial hypnotizability measurement

1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:29.820
 rather than whether or not

1:15:29.820 --> 1:15:31.180
 they had been trained to do better.

1:15:31.180 --> 1:15:33.060
 So you can improve it a little,

1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:34.460
 but it's not worth the trouble.

1:15:34.460 --> 1:15:35.420
 Got it.

1:15:35.420 --> 1:15:38.100
 Along the lines of eyes and eye movements,

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:40.060
 a lot of interest out there about EMDR,

1:15:40.060 --> 1:15:43.100
 eye movement desensitization reprocessing.

1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:46.900
 Shapiro herself was working,

1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:48.140
 she wasn't at Stanford directly,

1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:52.340
 but was the local to Stanford, I think in Palo Alto.

1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:55.220
 So what are your thoughts on EMDR?

1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:56.260
 Where is it useful?

1:15:56.260 --> 1:15:58.500
 Where do you think it's less useful?

1:15:58.500 --> 1:16:00.780
 Are there things that EMDR could be combined with

1:16:00.780 --> 1:16:03.120
 to make it more useful?

1:16:06.260 --> 1:16:08.460
 The listeners of this podcast come to,

1:16:08.460 --> 1:16:11.660
 I think come to the podcast with a range of backgrounds

1:16:11.660 --> 1:16:13.060
 and interests.

1:16:13.060 --> 1:16:17.980
 To me, it makes sense why EMDR lateralized eye movements

1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:19.940
 might work given the newer data

1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:22.740
 that it can suppress amygdala activity in some animals

1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:25.580
 and animal models and in humans as well.

1:16:25.580 --> 1:16:27.940
 But it really hasn't been explored much neurally.

1:16:27.940 --> 1:16:29.500
 I've heard things like it coordinates

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:30.500
 the two sides of the brain,

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:33.300
 which to me is just a throwaway.

1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:34.580
 I don't think there's any evidence

1:16:34.580 --> 1:16:36.480
 that coordinating the two sides of the brain

1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:38.320
 is better than not coordinating.

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:39.380
 I wouldn't be speaking right now

1:16:39.380 --> 1:16:42.220
 if the two sides of my brain were well correlated

1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:43.820
 because language is lateralized.

1:16:43.820 --> 1:16:46.680
 So I've heard that it mimics rapid eye movements

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:48.540
 during sleep, but actually it doesn't.

1:16:48.540 --> 1:16:52.620
 So, but I have heard people talk about

1:16:52.620 --> 1:16:55.220
 their positive experiences with EMDR.

1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:56.740
 What are your thoughts about EMDR?

1:16:56.740 --> 1:16:58.420
 Yeah, you had a good comment on that

1:16:58.420 --> 1:16:59.800
 in one of your recent podcasts.

1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:04.800
 And I'll tell you, one way I sort of think about it

1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:07.860
 from a bemused point of view is the old,

1:17:07.860 --> 1:17:10.700
 you mentioned it earlier, the oldest sort of idea

1:17:10.700 --> 1:17:14.060
 of a hypnotic induction was a dangling watch, right?

1:17:14.060 --> 1:17:15.380
 You know, a watch.

1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:19.640
 And in fact, there was enough concern about it

1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:21.700
 that when automobiles were invented,

1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:25.980
 there was a movement to prevent installing windshield wipers

1:17:25.980 --> 1:17:29.620
 because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized

1:17:29.620 --> 1:17:31.420
 if they watched the windshield wipers

1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:33.620
 go back and forth on a car.

1:17:33.620 --> 1:17:36.420
 Now it turns out fortunately that you tend not

1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:37.540
 to look at the windshield wipers.

1:17:37.540 --> 1:17:40.300
 You keep looking through the windshield.

1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:42.740
 And so we have windshield wipers today.

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:45.300
 But that movement is what exactly

1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:46.780
 used to be a hypnotic induction.

1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:50.820
 I think there is a lot of hypnosis in EMDR.

1:17:50.820 --> 1:17:52.940
 And I think it's a combination of that

1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:55.780
 with exposure-based treatments

1:17:55.780 --> 1:17:57.780
 where you use EMDR to think about it.

1:17:57.780 --> 1:18:01.020
 You tend not to process the experience as much

1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:03.140
 and just do the physical part of it,

1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:05.380
 which I personally think is a drawback.

1:18:05.380 --> 1:18:09.420
 And every study I've seen that was a dismantling study,

1:18:09.420 --> 1:18:11.780
 there's no question that people who go through EMDR,

1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:14.680
 many of them get better with trauma-related problems.

1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:17.480
 And the VA has a big program using it and so on.

1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:20.620
 But every program that has dismantled

1:18:20.620 --> 1:18:21.840
 going through the treatment

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:23.780
 with having the lateral eye movement

1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:26.380
 has shown that the lateral eye movement

1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:27.860
 doesn't add anything to it.

1:18:27.860 --> 1:18:29.880
 And toward the end of her career,

1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:34.460
 Francine was doing now contralateral touching or something.

1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:35.860
 It wasn't eye movements anymore.

1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:36.700
 It was other things.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:41.420
 So I tend to think that EMDR

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:45.660
 is another form of exposure-based therapy for trauma.

1:18:45.660 --> 1:18:47.940
 But as you've implied,

1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:50.460
 with the exception of this possible new data,

1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:51.940
 it certainly doesn't have to do

1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:53.780
 with rapid eye movement, sleep.

1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:56.420
 And I don't think moving the eyes is the issue.

1:18:56.420 --> 1:18:59.500
 I think it's a way of sitting down and confronting trauma.

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:01.600
 And I would rather that the trauma itself

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:04.220
 be processed a bit more than often happens

1:19:04.220 --> 1:19:05.100
 in EMDR.

1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:07.200
 So a lot of people have gotten therapy.

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:08.520
 Some of them have been helped.

1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:10.460
 Francine used to originally claim

1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:13.340
 that just one session would desensitize people and do it.

1:19:13.340 --> 1:19:14.940
 And that's clearly not true.

1:19:14.940 --> 1:19:16.380
 I see a lot of people who said,

1:19:16.380 --> 1:19:18.780
 yeah, it helped for a while, but I need more.

1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:23.780
 So I think it became a kind of overly simplistic approach

1:19:26.100 --> 1:19:30.380
 to understanding brain physiology, and that part is wrong.

1:19:30.380 --> 1:19:33.020
 And the interesting thing,

1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:35.660
 you mentioned suppressing amygdala activity.

1:19:35.660 --> 1:19:37.020
 It's very interesting.

1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:39.420
 My late friend, Alan Hobson,

1:19:39.420 --> 1:19:40.740
 who was a brilliant sleep researcher,

1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:42.100
 you know Alan, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:42.940
 Well, I don't know him,

1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:45.020
 but I read his book when I was in college

1:19:45.020 --> 1:19:46.820
 about the chemistry of sleep

1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:51.820
 and the similarities between dream states and hallucinations.

1:19:51.940 --> 1:19:54.500
 And it's one of the reasons I got into this business.

1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:55.900
 Yes, well, I worked with him

1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:58.260
 in a MacArthur MindBody Network for many years.

1:19:58.260 --> 1:19:59.580
 And he's a brilliant guy,

1:19:59.580 --> 1:20:02.980
 points out that we need to get into primarily

1:20:02.980 --> 1:20:05.980
 a parasympathetic state to go to sleep,

1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:09.700
 that we have to shut off the sympathetic nervous system.

1:20:09.700 --> 1:20:11.580
 And that's why a loud noise wakes you up

1:20:11.580 --> 1:20:13.500
 when your heart rate goes up and all this.

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:16.500
 So he was brilliant at documenting

1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:17.700
 what happens in the brain of sleep.

1:20:17.700 --> 1:20:20.820
 He pointed out something also very interesting about dreams,

1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:23.740
 which is that the stories in dreams

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:24.960
 and even the images in dreams

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:27.460
 can change all over the place in crazy ways,

1:20:27.460 --> 1:20:30.380
 but usually the affect is constant.

1:20:30.380 --> 1:20:32.680
 So usually if it's a frustration dream,

1:20:32.680 --> 1:20:34.600
 whatever happens, you wind up frustrated.

1:20:34.600 --> 1:20:36.860
 And if it's a enjoyment dream,

1:20:36.860 --> 1:20:38.660
 you enjoy whatever's going on.

1:20:38.660 --> 1:20:42.220
 So there's a odd consistency and affect in dreams

1:20:42.220 --> 1:20:44.980
 that you don't have in other states.

1:20:44.980 --> 1:20:47.900
 And the idea of lateral eye movements

1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:50.340
 suppressing amygdala activity would kind of fit with that,

1:20:50.340 --> 1:20:54.420
 that you don't allow intrusions of fear and anger

1:20:54.420 --> 1:20:55.620
 and upset in dreams.

1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:56.980
 It may be there all the time,

1:20:56.980 --> 1:20:59.660
 but it may not be there when you think it should be.

1:20:59.660 --> 1:21:02.080
 So why is it that you can be falling off a building

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:03.780
 and somehow not that scared?

1:21:03.780 --> 1:21:06.860
 You're just having this experience of flying in a dream.

1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:10.980
 So I think there may be something going on

1:21:10.980 --> 1:21:12.220
 about regulating affect,

1:21:12.220 --> 1:21:16.700
 but we have elaborate and better ways to regulate affect.

1:21:16.700 --> 1:21:21.180
 Great, so EMDR might incorporate some elements of hypnosis.

1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:22.900
 So the lateral eye movements,

1:21:22.900 --> 1:21:24.800
 perhaps by way of suppressing the amygdala,

1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:27.060
 this fear associated center might bring people

1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:29.240
 into a more parasympathetic calm state.

1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:32.140
 So it might be pseudo hypnosis and then exposure therapy

1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:34.020
 through the discussion about the issue.

1:21:34.020 --> 1:21:35.700
 Right. Okay.

1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:38.400
 More research needed on EMDR out there.

1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:42.720
 And obviously something that's come up a lot

1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:45.540
 in this discussion and in our discussions

1:21:45.540 --> 1:21:48.660
 that I have the great fortune of talking to you every week

1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:50.540
 is, and working together,

1:21:50.540 --> 1:21:55.540
 is this idea of getting close to the phobia,

1:21:56.380 --> 1:21:57.740
 getting close to the trauma,

1:21:57.740 --> 1:22:00.100
 re-experiencing it as a portal

1:22:00.100 --> 1:22:02.420
 to then adjusting the response to it

1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:05.740
 and rewiring something so the troubling thing

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:09.060
 or the horrible thing is no longer as horrible to us.

1:22:09.060 --> 1:22:14.060
 That, but the repeating theme is we can't expect

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.160
 to get over something without getting really close to it,

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:20.940
 maybe even experiencing it somatically.

1:22:20.940 --> 1:22:24.740
 Nowadays, we hear a lot about triggers and trigger warnings,

1:22:24.740 --> 1:22:28.460
 and certainly one can understand why those are,

1:22:28.460 --> 1:22:31.220
 why those exist, but it seems like there's a,

1:22:31.220 --> 1:22:32.680
 in the general population,

1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:35.100
 there's this idea that we want to move away

1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:36.440
 from anything that upsets us.

1:22:36.440 --> 1:22:38.220
 And yet I think it's fair to say,

1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:41.620
 even though having gathered the statistics that on the whole

1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:44.460
 that the human beings are becoming more and more anxious

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:48.860
 and more and more stressed, perhaps because of,

1:22:48.860 --> 1:22:51.640
 but certainly in parallel with the fact

1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:52.820
 that we're trying to move away

1:22:52.820 --> 1:22:54.500
 from troubling things, troubling things.

1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:59.460
 So I've heard you say before that it's,

1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:01.140
 in terms of therapeutic approaches,

1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:03.380
 it's not just about the state you get into,

1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:06.940
 but whether or not you brought yourself there voluntarily.

1:23:06.940 --> 1:23:07.780
 That's exactly right.

1:23:07.780 --> 1:23:11.460
 So this element of deliberate self-exposure,

1:23:11.460 --> 1:23:14.320
 deciding I'm going to confront the trauma,

1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:15.980
 I'm going to confront the pain,

1:23:15.980 --> 1:23:18.020
 I'm going to confront the insomnia,

1:23:18.020 --> 1:23:20.800
 I'm going to confront the, you know, and fill in the blank,

1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:24.540
 and then readjusting one's emotional response

1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:28.060
 right up next to that troubling thing.

1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:31.260
 That seems to be the hallmark of this treatment.

1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:34.580
 And if I'm thinking about it correctly,

1:23:34.580 --> 1:23:37.580
 of pretty much all treatments for getting over stuff,

1:23:38.620 --> 1:23:40.060
 if people don't have access

1:23:40.060 --> 1:23:42.580
 to a really good clinician like yourself,

1:23:42.580 --> 1:23:45.900
 how should they carry these thoughts and these ideas?

1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:49.220
 I mean, I think almost everybody of any reasonable age

1:23:49.220 --> 1:23:52.260
 has memories or things that upset them,

1:23:52.260 --> 1:23:53.880
 but we learn to suppress them.

1:23:54.980 --> 1:23:56.820
 What does one do?

1:23:56.820 --> 1:23:58.580
 Obviously the Reverie app has approaches

1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:02.460
 to dealing with some of this inside of the app,

1:24:02.460 --> 1:24:04.260
 but how does one start to think about

1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:06.680
 actually dealing with something like this

1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:09.380
 and avoiding the hazards of just kind of reactivating

1:24:09.380 --> 1:24:10.860
 a lot of painful experiences?

1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:12.780
 Because a lot of being a functional human being

1:24:12.780 --> 1:24:15.420
 is also going to work each day, interacting with people,

1:24:15.420 --> 1:24:17.180
 and not bringing one's trauma, you know,

1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:19.100
 and dumping it out on the table,

1:24:19.100 --> 1:24:22.780
 or being able to just function is so crucial.

1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:25.420
 So how do you think about this as a clinician?

1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:27.420
 Well, you know, the image that comes to mind

1:24:27.420 --> 1:24:29.460
 is the Greek myth of Pandora's box, you know,

1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:31.340
 that it opened and the Furies got out

1:24:31.340 --> 1:24:33.260
 and you couldn't put them back in.

1:24:33.260 --> 1:24:35.060
 And we have this kind of fantasy

1:24:35.060 --> 1:24:37.580
 that once you get into these memories,

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:38.420
 they'll take you over

1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:40.540
 and you'll never get them back in the box.

1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:41.940
 And I think that's wrong.

1:24:41.940 --> 1:24:44.660
 You know, people who use hypnosis say

1:24:44.660 --> 1:24:47.660
 that there are ways to present things to people

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:49.660
 that will be helpful in ways that won't.

1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:51.760
 And one real mistake is to tell someone,

1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:54.280
 don't think about purple elephants, you know,

1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:55.180
 what are you thinking about?

1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:56.560
 You know, it doesn't work.

1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:01.060
 So you want to find a way to feel in control of the access

1:25:01.060 --> 1:25:04.420
 and to define what happened on your own terms.

1:25:04.420 --> 1:25:06.820
 And so I'm not a big fan of trigger warnings.

1:25:06.820 --> 1:25:09.000
 I think we're going crazy over, you know,

1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.740
 this could be upsetting, that could be upsetting.

1:25:10.740 --> 1:25:12.320
 Yeah, there are lots of things that are upsetting.

1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:16.180
 You know, the average kid has watched 20,000 murders

1:25:16.180 --> 1:25:17.680
 by the time he's 20 years old

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:20.240
 watching television and movies these days.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.220
 So, you know, we see terrible things

1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:24.300
 and it's not a matter of,

1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:26.820
 are you exposed to something that's upsetting,

1:25:26.820 --> 1:25:28.060
 but how do you handle it?

1:25:28.060 --> 1:25:28.920
 What do you make of it?

1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:30.340
 And are you feeling in control?

1:25:30.340 --> 1:25:31.820
 It's not like, you know,

1:25:31.820 --> 1:25:36.640
 what Putin is doing to his rival in Russia, you know,

1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:39.340
 forcing him to watch propaganda movies 10 hours a day

1:25:39.340 --> 1:25:40.780
 while he's in prison.

1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:45.780
 It's a matter of thinking about a problem

1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:49.180
 in a way that leaves you feeling you understand it better,

1:25:49.180 --> 1:25:50.060
 you're in more control,

1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:52.620
 you can turn it off when you want,

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:54.260
 you can turn it on when you want.

1:25:54.260 --> 1:25:57.280
 And so we have to, in life, deal with stressful things.

1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:58.460
 There are studies,

1:25:58.460 --> 1:26:01.980
 Karen Parker at Stanford has done some wonderful studies

1:26:01.980 --> 1:26:04.060
 with primates about stress inoculation,

1:26:04.060 --> 1:26:07.980
 that if you separate a baby monkey from his mother

1:26:07.980 --> 1:26:10.420
 for two hours a day and then reunite them,

1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:13.260
 and then you stress that baby monkey later,

1:26:13.260 --> 1:26:14.880
 they actually handle stress better.

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:17.600
 There's less cortisol arousal in the face of the stress.

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:19.360
 Stress inoculation has been called.

1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:23.280
 So mere exposure to trauma or stress,

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:24.860
 it's a part of living anyway.

1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:27.140
 We can't avoid it even if we'd like to.

1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:30.200
 And it's not pleasant, it's not great,

1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:32.680
 but it's sometimes things you need to learn about life.

1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:36.420
 And if you can find an algorithm for facing it,

1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:38.460
 putting it into perspective, dealing with it,

1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:40.820
 you become a stronger person, not a weaker person.

1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:44.680
 So this idea that college students are such fragile flowers

1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:47.260
 that if you talk about a sexual assault or something,

1:26:47.260 --> 1:26:50.340
 you're doing something terrible to them, it's just wrong.

1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:54.460
 And I think we need to build our ability

1:26:54.460 --> 1:26:56.260
 to recognize and manage stress.

1:26:56.260 --> 1:26:58.020
 And you can't do that without doing it.

1:26:58.020 --> 1:27:00.380
 You can't learn or you can't ride a bicycle

1:27:00.380 --> 1:27:02.780
 without taking the risk of falling off it.

1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:05.440
 And so I think that's the way I think

1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:07.340
 of dealing with stress.

1:27:07.340 --> 1:27:10.220
 Yeah, I really appreciate you saying that.

1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:12.180
 You and I were both at a gathering,

1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:14.920
 let's say where this issue was being discussed

1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:18.700
 and around an issue of a publicized sexual trauma.

1:27:18.700 --> 1:27:21.900
 And you made an excellent case for why

1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:23.980
 this stuff can't be pushed under the rug.

1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:27.500
 And that actually, in my observation,

1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:29.380
 led to a lot of healing for the people that,

1:27:29.380 --> 1:27:32.620
 and the families of people that suffered from this.

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:34.500
 I do think people are resilient,

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:39.500
 but we don't really teach how to think about feelings.

1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:43.060
 You know, we're told that we need to feel our feelings,

1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:45.660
 but then again, we are also told that feelings

1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:47.100
 don't hold all the information.

1:27:47.100 --> 1:27:48.580
 And so I think that, as you mentioned,

1:27:48.580 --> 1:27:51.220
 there's no operating or user's manual

1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:53.340
 for this nervous system thing.

1:27:53.340 --> 1:27:54.540
 Brings me to another issue,

1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:56.000
 which is the mind-body connection,

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.780
 something that we're very interested in.

1:27:57.780 --> 1:27:59.820
 And you've done extensive work on.

1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:03.680
 We all like to think that getting more in touch

1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:05.520
 with our body would be a great thing.

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:07.220
 Learning to intercept, paying attention

1:28:07.220 --> 1:28:09.100
 to our internal landscape would be a great thing.

1:28:09.100 --> 1:28:13.140
 But as we often discuss, when we're feeling lousy,

1:28:13.140 --> 1:28:15.820
 then being really in touch with that lousy feeling

1:28:15.820 --> 1:28:18.700
 may or may not be a good thing, right?

1:28:18.700 --> 1:28:21.380
 So how should we think about mind-body?

1:28:21.380 --> 1:28:23.860
 I can see examples in hypnosis,

1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:25.420
 from your descriptions of hypnosis,

1:28:25.420 --> 1:28:29.880
 where you want to unify the mind-body connection,

1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:31.740
 feel what you're thinking,

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:33.300
 think what you're feeling, et cetera.

1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:36.100
 But I could also point to elements

1:28:36.100 --> 1:28:39.460
 within the hypnotic process in which you are actively

1:28:39.460 --> 1:28:41.340
 trying to uncouple those.

1:28:41.340 --> 1:28:44.380
 So it sounds to me like this whole mind-body thing

1:28:44.380 --> 1:28:46.100
 is a bit more like a car.

1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:49.740
 You can't say that 40 miles per hour is the optimal speed.

1:28:49.740 --> 1:28:51.660
 It kind of depends on the road you're on

1:28:51.660 --> 1:28:53.760
 and the turn you may or may not be taking.

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:57.440
 But how should we think about mind-body

1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:00.100
 in terms of navigating daily life?

1:29:00.100 --> 1:29:02.000
 What do you think is the adaptive way

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.060
 to conceptualize the mind-body?

1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:07.320
 It's a big question.

1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:10.760
 It is, it's a very interesting one.

1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:14.800
 I guess I think that it's a matter

1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:18.520
 not of absolute control, but more control,

1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:23.440
 that we need to think of our brain as a tool.

1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:26.660
 And our body signals as tools as well

1:29:26.660 --> 1:29:29.960
 to help us understand what's going on in the world,

1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:33.360
 what we need, what matters, what's important, what isn't.

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:36.240
 But also something that can be managed,

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:39.240
 not simply absorbed.

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:43.520
 And so hypnosis, I think, is a kind of limiting case

1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:46.800
 where you can push it about as far as we can push it

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:48.680
 in terms of regulating pain.

1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:51.680
 Pain is a good example of that.

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:53.600
 Obviously, you need to pay attention.

1:29:53.600 --> 1:29:54.680
 If you just broke your ankle,

1:29:54.680 --> 1:29:56.800
 you better pay attention to it and get help,

1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:59.360
 or you're having crushing substernal chest pain.

1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:00.840
 You better do something about it.

1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:03.180
 But our brain is sort of programmed

1:30:03.180 --> 1:30:06.260
 to treat all pain signals as if they were novel pain signals

1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:09.600
 if it's a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to.

1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.160
 I teach people to think of the pain and categorize it.

1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:17.880
 See, does the pain mean that if you put weight on this,

1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:20.960
 you're gonna re-injure your ankle, for example,

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.040
 or does it simply mean that your body is healing

1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:25.420
 and the pain is a sign that gradually

1:30:25.420 --> 1:30:27.200
 things are getting back to normal?

1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:31.720
 And so you can modify the way you process pain

1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:35.480
 based on what your brain tells you the pain means.

1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:37.720
 And that's true for emotional pain as well.

1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:42.040
 And particularly where I think a strategy that really helps

1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.880
 is if you think of an interpersonal problem

1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:50.880
 or a threat of something coming as an opportunity

1:30:51.180 --> 1:30:53.580
 to do something to ameliorate the situation.

1:30:53.580 --> 1:30:56.120
 So it's not just it's happening to you,

1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:59.480
 but something that you can influence and do something about.

1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:04.100
 So it's blending the receptive with the active response

1:31:04.100 --> 1:31:05.340
 that I think can make a difference.

1:31:05.340 --> 1:31:06.960
 So you try and process it in a way

1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:09.460
 that gives you a deeper understanding of what's happening.

1:31:09.460 --> 1:31:11.760
 You face it, but you also say,

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:14.640
 this is an opportunity for me to do something about it.

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:17.360
 And the minute you realistically enhance,

1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:19.900
 and this doesn't mean imagine a way, a heart attack,

1:31:19.900 --> 1:31:24.520
 it means figure out how to rehabilitate from a heart attack

1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:27.320
 or a broken leg or something like that

1:31:27.320 --> 1:31:30.120
 in a way that you get as much control

1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:32.640
 into the situation as you can.

1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:33.480
 I love it.

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:38.280
 Grief, grief is one of those states

1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:42.800
 that is very hard to remove oneself from.

1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:46.240
 And a lot of people ask me, how do I deal with grief?

1:31:46.240 --> 1:31:49.480
 And I'm not a clinician, so I'm deferring to you.

1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:52.680
 On the one hand, actually someone at Stanford recently

1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:54.760
 came to me and said, my mother passed away

1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:56.100
 and I had a sibling that passed away

1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:57.560
 and they were the only people that I had.

1:31:57.560 --> 1:31:59.160
 And I'm also living alone

1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:01.180
 and I'm challenged with a number of things.

1:32:01.180 --> 1:32:04.140
 And they looked like they were holding it together

1:32:05.320 --> 1:32:08.040
 very well, in fact, given what they were describing.

1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:09.940
 And on the one hand,

1:32:09.940 --> 1:32:13.460
 well, I certainly pointed out that I'm not a clinician,

1:32:13.460 --> 1:32:14.820
 but I said, on the one hand,

1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:17.580
 you could imagine that it would be necessary and useful

1:32:17.580 --> 1:32:19.020
 to go into the grief state

1:32:19.020 --> 1:32:20.860
 if you want to transition through it.

1:32:22.660 --> 1:32:25.580
 On the other hand, I've heard before

1:32:25.580 --> 1:32:29.380
 that the cathartic model of just really diving

1:32:29.380 --> 1:32:32.780
 into an emotion can also be potentially hazardous

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:37.780
 if you don't have any anchors to grab onto.

1:32:37.780 --> 1:32:41.720
 What is the view of psychiatry or your view of grief

1:32:41.720 --> 1:32:43.040
 and how to deal with grief?

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:45.280
 Because I think grief is one of those

1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:48.540
 all-encompassing emotions for many people.

1:32:48.540 --> 1:32:50.640
 It is, and it's a very important,

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:52.640
 natural, necessary stage of life.

1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:55.120
 And the reason we have all these grief rituals

1:32:55.120 --> 1:32:59.380
 from burials and memorials and headstones

1:32:59.380 --> 1:33:02.180
 and sitting Shiva and other things that people do,

1:33:02.180 --> 1:33:04.440
 it's a way of making it real,

1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:08.140
 that an incomprehensible loss has to be comprehended.

1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:10.880
 You have to realize that you're now gonna have to live life

1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:14.540
 without your loved one, your parent, your sibling, whoever.

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:18.300
 And we've all gone through this at one time or another.

1:33:18.300 --> 1:33:19.720
 I certainly have.

1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:22.880
 And it's very hard to just come to terms with,

1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:26.240
 but one principle is to sort of say,

1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:29.520
 it's never all or none, it's more or less.

1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:33.000
 So yes, it's all or none that you've lost a loved one.

1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.860
 But I ask people as part of their grieving

1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:37.400
 to say to themselves,

1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:39.700
 and I do this in hypnosis sometimes too,

1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:44.080
 you've lost them, but what have they left you with?

1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:47.280
 What have they bequeathed to you even though they're gone?

1:33:47.280 --> 1:33:49.300
 And I'll sometimes ask them to say,

1:33:49.300 --> 1:33:51.560
 if your mother could be here right now,

1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:53.320
 what would she say to you?

1:33:53.320 --> 1:33:55.040
 How would she feel about your life now?

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:57.000
 What would she advise you to do?

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.240
 So in our support groups for women

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:02.240
 with advanced breast cancer, we lost people.

1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:04.840
 And I gotta tell you that we were warned by oncologists

1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:06.920
 that we demoralize people that,

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:08.340
 I mean, they were wonderful oncologists,

1:34:08.340 --> 1:34:09.980
 but there were some that were very afraid

1:34:09.980 --> 1:34:13.040
 that we would harm them in some way

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:16.600
 because the mortality rate is fairly high

1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:18.280
 with metastatic breast cancer.

1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:21.140
 They're gonna watch people die of the same disease

1:34:21.140 --> 1:34:23.080
 and you'll demoralize them.

1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:25.920
 So we actually measured their emotion

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:28.220
 and the content of speech every five minutes

1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:29.340
 throughout a bunch of groups

1:34:29.340 --> 1:34:30.560
 to make sure that wasn't happening.

1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:33.780
 What we found was that they talked about more serious issues

1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:35.860
 but the mood didn't actually get worse.

1:34:35.860 --> 1:34:39.000
 And we found in general that expressing negative emotion

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.200
 on the long run helps people be less anxious

1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:42.160
 and depressed over time.

1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:44.360
 And we've shown this in randomized clinical trials,

1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:47.200
 so it's not just my clinical impression.

1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:52.200
 And what we try to get them to do is to face a loss,

1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:56.240
 live with the emotion that comes with it,

1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:58.840
 but also see that the reason it hurts so much

1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:00.520
 is how much that person gave you.

1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:03.100
 So we would do a self-hypnosis exercise

1:35:03.100 --> 1:35:03.940
 at the end of the group and say,

1:35:03.940 --> 1:35:06.980
 I want you to get your body floating safe and comfortable.

1:35:06.980 --> 1:35:11.520
 Now picture Mary and sit with the feeling of sadness

1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:13.440
 that she's no longer with us.

1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:14.960
 And we do that for a few minutes.

1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:16.760
 And then we'd say on the other side,

1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:19.640
 picture one thing she left with you that you still have

1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:21.800
 that you carry on in your heart

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.520
 her tradition of what she gave to you.

1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:28.120
 And so just seeing it not as a complete loss,

1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:30.780
 but as a real loss, a painful loss,

1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:33.560
 but one that helps you to reflect on what you gained

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:35.720
 from her and knowing her,

1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:38.600
 I think can be very helpful in the grieving process.

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:41.800
 That's very helpful, a way to conceptualize it.

1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:43.580
 A couple of quick questions.

1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:48.840
 Can children be safely hypnotized or do self-hypnosis?

1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:52.880
 It's sometimes harder for them to do self-hypnosis.

1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.600
 They need more structure to do it.

1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:58.400
 You've gotta share your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

1:35:58.400 --> 1:35:59.700
 with them a little bit.

1:35:59.700 --> 1:36:03.000
 But yes, absolutely, children can be very hypnotizable.

1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:08.000
 And I know pediatricians who use it wonderfully all the time

1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:10.800
 they get them to focus on something else.

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:12.600
 So they're gonna have to give them a shot

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.000
 or draw blood or something.

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.400
 And they'll say, I'm gonna press your happy button

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:20.040
 and presses their belly button

1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:21.840
 and they start to giggle the way kids do.

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.440
 And meanwhile, the nurses drawing the blood

1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:26.220
 and they don't even notice it.

1:36:26.220 --> 1:36:28.160
 Dentists, good dentists can use it

1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:30.380
 to help kids with fear and pain.

1:36:30.380 --> 1:36:32.720
 So yes, it can be very effective for children.

1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:34.040
 We did a randomized trial.

1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:36.000
 I have a publication in pediatrics.

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.920
 My late sister who was a pediatrician

1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:41.640
 and who always used to joke that she was the only one

1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:43.440
 in our family who was a real doctor.

1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:47.920
 I said, I got you, I got a paper in pediatrics.

1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:51.480
 And the paper was children having to undergo

1:36:51.480 --> 1:36:53.120
 avoiding cystourethrograms.

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:56.880
 So the anatomy of the kidney, if you'll forgive me,

1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:00.000
 is sort of interesting in that the ureter

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.680
 that goes into the bladder

1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:04.120
 normally goes into the bladder at an angle.

1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:06.800
 And so that means that when the bladder contracts

1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:10.800
 to expel urine, it automatically closes off the ureter

1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:12.820
 because it's sideways to the bladder.

1:37:12.820 --> 1:37:14.880
 Some kids are born with it perpendicular

1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:17.160
 and then you'll get reflux into the kidney.

1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:19.260
 And some children outgrow it.

1:37:19.260 --> 1:37:22.640
 Some need pretty complicated surgery to fix that.

1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:26.000
 And so you image them every year or so

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.640
 to see whether they're getting kidney damage or not.

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:30.440
 And it's a pretty miserable experience.

1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:32.000
 You're a nine-year-old girl.

1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.880
 You have to go and lie on a hard, cold table,

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.600
 have strangers pull your legs apart

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:38.480
 and stick a catheter into your urethra

1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:41.640
 and hold in the bladder and then expel urine.

1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:43.800
 And so you get into these struggling fights.

1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:45.120
 And of course, the more they struggle,

1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:47.540
 the more they constrict and it makes it harder to do it.

1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:51.000
 So I was asked if we could test it.

1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.080
 So we did a randomized trial at Children's Hospital.

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:56.240
 They either got training in self-hypnosis.

1:37:56.240 --> 1:37:59.200
 I would meet with them and the mother the week before.

1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:01.440
 We find out from the kids where they like to be.

1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:03.740
 And I'd say, you're gonna play a trick on your doctors.

1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:04.580
 Your body's there.

1:38:04.580 --> 1:38:05.580
 You're somewhere else.

1:38:05.580 --> 1:38:06.680
 Go visit your friend.

1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:07.520
 Go to Disneyland.

1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:08.340
 Do something else.

1:38:08.340 --> 1:38:10.060
 And the mother would work on this with me

1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:11.600
 at the head of the table.

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.280
 And we found that these children were much easier to image.

1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:17.380
 One got so relaxed that, so your guy would,

1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:18.920
 he said, normally it takes us 10 minutes

1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:21.160
 to get them to pee after they're doing this.

1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:22.780
 She was so relaxed, she started peeing

1:38:22.780 --> 1:38:25.100
 before I could even get the bedpan under her

1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:27.200
 and I had to clean up the table, you know.

1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:30.400
 And they also, 17 minutes shorter procedures.

1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:33.820
 And that's a long 17 minutes for a little kid.

1:38:33.820 --> 1:38:36.560
 So it can be very effective with children.

1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:37.440
 They're less anxious.

1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:38.480
 They have less pain

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:42.360
 and get through these difficult procedures very well.

1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:43.600
 That's great.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:46.480
 Has hypnosis ever been done for couples,

1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:47.560
 like couples therapy?

1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:49.860
 I'm thinking of pretty much every clinical setting here.

1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:52.460
 Both people have to be hypnotizable, of course.

1:38:52.460 --> 1:38:54.680
 But the reason I ask about this is next,

1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:56.480
 I'm going to ask about psychedelics.

1:38:56.480 --> 1:38:59.620
 And there's a lot of interest in coordinating states

1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:04.040
 through the use of drugs of different kinds.

1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:05.840
 We actually do this when we treat depression, right?

1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:08.360
 You have a depressed person with a family members

1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:09.600
 who are not depressed and you say, well,

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:13.080
 let's make them all not depressed, right?

1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:15.960
 I mean, but in all, and I'm only half kidding there

1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:18.480
 because that is kind of the underlying logic in some sense,

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.480
 but are you aware of any coordinated hypnosis?

1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:25.000
 That's interesting.

1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.880
 I've done plenty of it in groups, not with couples.

1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:29.880
 You can hypnotize large groups at once?

1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:30.720
 Yeah, yeah.

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:31.540
 Are we hypnotized right now?

1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:32.380
 Yeah, you are.

1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:34.100
 I hope you've been enjoying it.

1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:39.040
 But the metastatic breast cancer,

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:40.580
 and there was a group of like 10 women

1:39:40.580 --> 1:39:41.640
 who would meet once a week

1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:44.440
 and we would all go into hypnosis together.

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.560
 I didn't realize that you were hypnotizing them

1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:47.400
 collectively.

1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:48.820
 Yes, yes, right.

1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:49.660
 Fascinating.

1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:51.180
 And that, you know, if anything,

1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:53.640
 I think it brings out the best in people's abilities

1:39:53.640 --> 1:39:55.700
 because it's a shared social experience

1:39:55.700 --> 1:39:59.240
 and they would talk about it afterwards.

1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:02.500
 And so, yes, that's absolutely doable, yeah.

1:40:02.500 --> 1:40:05.160
 And I don't want to focus on psychedelics specifically,

1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:06.880
 maybe that's a topic for a future episode,

1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:10.680
 but is there any basis for combining hypnosis

1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:15.480
 with drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode?

1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.260
 So I realize that some patients of yours

1:40:17.260 --> 1:40:19.860
 might be prescribed a antidepressant

1:40:19.860 --> 1:40:23.340
 or a medication for some purpose,

1:40:23.340 --> 1:40:25.040
 maybe same or different than the hypnosis

1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:26.520
 is being directed toward,

1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.880
 but is there any evidence that if people are relaxed

1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:34.180
 through the use of a Propranolol or some, you know,

1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:37.200
 one of these many things in the psychiatrist's kit,

1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:40.160
 that hypnosis can be more effective?

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:44.040
 Well, interestingly, one study that I haven't mentioned

1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:49.040
 is we did spectroscopy on people who were hypnotized

1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.360
 and we found that there was a correlation

1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:57.600
 between hypnotizability and GABA activity

1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.960
 in the anterior cingulate cortex,

1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:02.480
 which fits with turning down activity.

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:05.040
 So to the extent that we can self-medicate

1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:07.520
 and GABA receptors basically are doing

1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:10.480
 what benzodiazepines do to the brain,

1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:13.040
 that can happen when people are hypnotized.

1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:14.960
 So you're saying inside of the hypnosis,

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:18.120
 you have neural evidence that there's a kind of

1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:22.080
 a sedative effect of hypnosis at the chemical level?

1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:23.320
 Yeah, right, right.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:24.680
 The people who are more hypnotizable

1:41:24.680 --> 1:41:26.520
 have more of those GABA receptors

1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:29.320
 and it's related to the degree of their hypnotizability.

1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.380
 In terms of, there have been studies

1:41:32.380 --> 1:41:35.200
 where they try to give people medications as well.

1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:37.720
 And the interesting thing with benzodiazepines,

1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:41.280
 which activate inhibitory activity in the brain,

1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:44.360
 if you're very anxious,

1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.360
 it might improve your hypnotic response a bit

1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.560
 if you're just so anxious and you can't do it.

1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:49.720
 If you're not very anxious,

1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:52.080
 it actually inhibits hypnotic activity

1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:54.360
 because you get sort of sedated and just out of it

1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.720
 and you can't focus your attention as well.

1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:01.360
 So by and large, we don't use drugs

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:04.000
 as an adjuvant to hypnotic experience.

1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:05.320
 Most of the time you don't need to

1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:08.280
 and sometimes it can make it worse rather than better.

1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:12.320
 There's some evidence that mild stimulants

1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:15.320
 might enhance hypnotic responsiveness a little reliably,

1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:17.820
 but too much will again scatter attention

1:42:17.820 --> 1:42:19.520
 and you'll have less control over it.

1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:22.560
 So they might be adjuvants,

1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:25.700
 but I frankly think hypnosis is more of a replacement

1:42:25.700 --> 1:42:27.480
 than a need of supplementation.

1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:30.900
 Your laboratory, my laboratory have,

1:42:30.900 --> 1:42:34.420
 well, sort of snuck into your lab

1:42:34.420 --> 1:42:36.300
 and then trying to kind of merge the two.

1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:39.180
 It's been a lot of fun and learning a lot

1:42:39.180 --> 1:42:42.140
 about the power of respiration of breathing

1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:45.500
 to shift brain states, not just during breathing protocols,

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:47.060
 but at all times.

1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:49.660
 And we will do an entire episode about those protocols,

1:42:49.660 --> 1:42:54.560
 I think after those are published and so on.

1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:58.100
 But breathing itself is,

1:42:58.100 --> 1:42:59.980
 you've described as a bridge between conscious

1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:01.460
 and unconscious states.

1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:05.540
 And so I have to ask how important

1:43:05.540 --> 1:43:08.020
 is the patient's breathing pattern?

1:43:08.020 --> 1:43:11.220
 How closely are you monitoring their breathing pattern?

1:43:11.220 --> 1:43:13.600
 How closely do you monitor your own breathing pattern

1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:15.460
 as you're inducing hypnosis?

1:43:15.460 --> 1:43:17.820
 Put simply, what is the role of respiration

1:43:17.820 --> 1:43:22.820
 in shifting the brain's state during a hypnotic protocol?

1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:24.580
 Yeah, that's very interesting.

1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:26.780
 You had a great show with Jack Feldman.

1:43:26.780 --> 1:43:30.220
 Jack Feldman, and he is.

1:43:30.220 --> 1:43:35.220
 And the issue, I watch it, I try,

1:43:37.860 --> 1:43:40.320
 the work that we're enjoying doing together

1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:41.900
 shows that there are breathing patterns

1:43:41.900 --> 1:43:46.460
 that may increase sympathetic arousal or may decrease.

1:43:46.460 --> 1:43:49.280
 It may help in cyclic sighing,

1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:51.500
 seems to actually where you have more time spent

1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:53.500
 exhaling than inhaling.

1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:56.700
 And there's reason to believe that it induces

1:43:56.700 --> 1:43:58.220
 parasympathetic activity,

1:43:58.220 --> 1:44:00.720
 because you're increasing pressure in the chest.

1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:04.420
 And therefore, allowing the heart to slow down

1:44:04.420 --> 1:44:08.700
 because blood is being returned to the atrium more easily.

1:44:09.580 --> 1:44:12.620
 I do use it, I ask people to take a deep breath

1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:15.080
 as part of the induction and then slowly exhale.

1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:17.240
 And partly as a result of our research together,

1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:19.580
 I'm emphasizing this slow exhale more

1:44:19.580 --> 1:44:23.860
 as part of, to enhance the idea in the induction

1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:25.620
 that this is a period of relaxation,

1:44:25.620 --> 1:44:28.260
 because I think they are inducing that

1:44:28.260 --> 1:44:30.940
 and perhaps perceiving it as well.

1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:34.220
 So there's no, you're absolutely right

1:44:34.220 --> 1:44:36.660
 that breathing is very interesting

1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:38.300
 because it's right at the edge of conscious,

1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:39.700
 and Jack talked about that too,

1:44:39.700 --> 1:44:41.360
 of conscious and unconscious control,

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:44.900
 that it will go on automatically, but we can control it.

1:44:44.900 --> 1:44:47.320
 And so it's a kind of way for us to demonstrate

1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:52.320
 to ourselves greater ways of modulating our internal state.

1:44:54.260 --> 1:44:56.340
 So you can either do it thinking about it

1:44:56.340 --> 1:44:58.940
 the way we do with pain control and hypnosis,

1:44:58.940 --> 1:45:00.460
 or you can do it to some extent

1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:03.660
 by taking charge of your breathing

1:45:03.660 --> 1:45:05.960
 and doing things that will produce a change

1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:08.060
 that you want to see happen in your body.

1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:11.020
 So I like it because it's right at that margin

1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:14.100
 where you can enhance, for me,

1:45:14.100 --> 1:45:16.540
 I like that as a way of augmenting hypnosis

1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:17.740
 more than medication.

1:45:17.740 --> 1:45:20.740
 I think this is a powerful way of doing that.

1:45:20.740 --> 1:45:23.600
 Great, I'm really excited to see where all of this goes.

1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:28.020
 Breathing, vision, bodily states, clearly the,

1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:32.500
 and directed mental focus

1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:34.980
 seem to be the key elements of hypnosis.

1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:38.140
 Am I missing any other ingredients?

1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:39.900
 Yeah, I think that's right.

1:45:39.900 --> 1:45:40.940
 Breathing, vision.

1:45:40.940 --> 1:45:43.540
 Breathing, vision, how you change your vision.

1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:48.540
 And you don't, typically you're in a physically relaxed state

1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:52.860
 but frankly there are people at the peak of performance

1:45:52.860 --> 1:45:54.980
 including physical, athletic performance

1:45:54.980 --> 1:45:56.640
 or musical performance

1:45:56.640 --> 1:45:58.540
 when they're in hypnotic states too.

1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:01.060
 I've talked to classical pianists who say,

1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:02.340
 I'm not thinking, if I start thinking

1:46:02.340 --> 1:46:04.740
 about what my fingers are doing now, I screw up.

1:46:04.740 --> 1:46:08.300
 I'm floating above the piano thinking about the tone

1:46:08.300 --> 1:46:11.520
 that I want to feel exuding from the instrument.

1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:13.540
 So that's a hypnotic like state too.

1:46:13.540 --> 1:46:18.220
 And many athletes who are in peak performance

1:46:18.220 --> 1:46:20.100
 are just flowing with it.

1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:24.300
 They're not thinking step by step, what am I doing?

1:46:24.300 --> 1:46:26.020
 And that's when you're doing your best.

1:46:26.020 --> 1:46:31.020
 Or when we're working or giving a talk and doing it well,

1:46:33.020 --> 1:46:34.740
 we're in a hypnotic like state.

1:46:34.740 --> 1:46:39.700
 So it usually requires,

1:46:39.700 --> 1:46:42.220
 but doesn't necessarily require physical comfort

1:46:42.220 --> 1:46:43.260
 or quietness.

1:46:43.260 --> 1:46:45.980
 It can sometimes be intense activity.

1:46:45.980 --> 1:46:47.280
 Incredible.

1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:50.660
 Well, this has been an amazing discussion.

1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:54.060
 I've learned so much as I always do from you.

1:46:54.060 --> 1:46:56.060
 Where can people learn more

1:46:56.060 --> 1:46:58.860
 about how they can get hypnotized?

1:46:58.860 --> 1:47:00.660
 We mentioned Reveri, we will put a link to it.

1:47:00.660 --> 1:47:05.300
 It's R-E-V-E-R-I.com is the way to access that.

1:47:05.300 --> 1:47:07.860
 Or it's the Reveri app from the app store is the other way.

1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:10.560
 Reveri.com is the website, you can get to it through that

1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:13.840
 or download the Reveri app from the app store.

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:14.680
 Great.

1:47:15.740 --> 1:47:18.840
 So currently on Apple, hopefully soon, also on Android.

1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:20.320
 But in the meantime,

1:47:21.300 --> 1:47:24.260
 what if people are interested in exploring clinical hypnosis

1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:27.220
 working with you or somebody similar?

1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:29.740
 Is there a centralized resource that people can go to

1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:34.220
 to find really well-trained hypnotists?

1:47:34.220 --> 1:47:37.820
 There are two good professional organizations

1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:38.700
 that will help you with that.

1:47:38.700 --> 1:47:42.540
 One is the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis.

1:47:42.540 --> 1:47:46.940
 And I think that's S-C-E-H dot U-S is their website.

1:47:46.940 --> 1:47:48.140
 We'll look it up and provide a link.

1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:50.340
 And the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis.

1:47:50.340 --> 1:47:55.340
 And they both provide referral services for professionals.

1:47:55.500 --> 1:47:56.560
 You can look it up.

1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:58.060
 I would just say in general,

1:47:58.060 --> 1:48:00.820
 look for someone who is licensed and trained

1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:02.740
 in their primary professional discipline,

1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:06.140
 psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry,

1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:09.660
 and who has training and interest in using hypnosis

1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:11.140
 is a way to do it.

1:48:11.140 --> 1:48:11.980
 Great.

1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:15.140
 And then one more question, and then a comment.

1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:17.300
 The question is, will you be my psychiatrist?

1:48:17.300 --> 1:48:20.380
 I'm honored, I'm honored.

1:48:20.380 --> 1:48:22.180
 It's a tall task.

1:48:22.180 --> 1:48:24.460
 I might be the most stubborn patient.

1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:26.540
 I think the hardest work's already been done, Andrew.

1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:27.380
 Thank you.

1:48:27.380 --> 1:48:28.220
 You're fine now.

1:48:28.220 --> 1:48:29.040
 I appreciate that.

1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:31.820
 Well, and the final thing is a comment.

1:48:31.820 --> 1:48:35.140
 First of all, thank you so much for being here today,

1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:36.380
 for sharing your knowledge.

1:48:36.380 --> 1:48:38.840
 I hope we can do it again and again.

1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:39.680
 I hope so.

1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:41.740
 I love working with your laboratory and with you.

1:48:41.740 --> 1:48:42.580
 Likewise.

1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:44.600
 Because when you speak, I learn,

1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:47.860
 and I know others do as well.

1:48:47.860 --> 1:48:49.940
 We will put resources to get to you.

1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:51.980
 But I also just want to say thank you

1:48:51.980 --> 1:48:54.580
 for doing the work that you do.

1:48:54.580 --> 1:48:57.580
 It's an incredible thing that in this world

1:48:57.580 --> 1:49:00.480
 where we are discovering so much about how the body works,

1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:02.720
 the mind is still rather mysterious

1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:04.480
 and people are struggling with a lot of things.

1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:05.860
 But also I think people are really excited

1:49:05.860 --> 1:49:10.200
 about applying tools like hypnosis to perform better,

1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:11.660
 feel better mentally and physically.

1:49:11.660 --> 1:49:15.060
 And so you've pointed us to a tremendous amount of resources

1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:17.540
 and how these tools work

1:49:17.540 --> 1:49:19.500
 and where they've already been demonstrated to work.

1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:20.940
 So just thank you.

1:49:20.940 --> 1:49:25.060
 I know this is your life's professional commitment in life

1:49:25.060 --> 1:49:26.460
 and we all benefit.

1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:27.300
 So thank you so much.

1:49:27.300 --> 1:49:28.120
 Well, thank you.

1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:28.960
 But it's been a real joy for me

1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:30.300
 to be collaborating with you

1:49:30.300 --> 1:49:33.080
 and for you to be using your precision and knowledge

1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:37.380
 about neuroanatomy, neurobiology to address problems

1:49:37.380 --> 1:49:39.300
 that often people who are that disciplined

1:49:39.300 --> 1:49:42.180
 in the primary neurobiological end

1:49:42.180 --> 1:49:43.900
 aren't as interested in as you are.

1:49:43.900 --> 1:49:45.820
 And so it's really been a pleasure to try

1:49:45.820 --> 1:49:48.780
 and bring together what we both know

1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:50.320
 from these different perspectives

1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:53.540
 to build something that neither of us could do alone.

1:49:53.540 --> 1:49:56.100
 And so it's been a real joy for me to do it.

1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:56.940
 Thank you.

1:49:56.940 --> 1:49:57.760
 I'm honored.

1:49:57.760 --> 1:49:58.600
 Thank you.

1:49:58.600 --> 1:49:59.440
 Thank you very much, David.

1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:00.580
 You're welcome.

1:50:00.580 --> 1:50:01.700
 Thank you for joining me today

1:50:01.700 --> 1:50:04.020
 for my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel.

1:50:04.020 --> 1:50:06.860
 I hope you found it as fascinating as I did.

1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:08.300
 And if you'd like to see the video

1:50:08.300 --> 1:50:10.500
 of Dr. Spiegel hypnotizing me

1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:14.140
 in what constitutes a abbreviated clinical hypnosis session,

1:50:14.140 --> 1:50:17.580

 and there you can support the podcast

1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:08.500
 at any level that you like.

1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:10.820
 On many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,

1:51:10.820 --> 1:51:12.140
 we discussed supplements.

1:51:12.140 --> 1:51:13.960
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:16.200
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:18.460
 for things like enhancing sleep and focus

1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:19.780
 and various other aspects

1:51:19.780 --> 1:51:22.000
 of brain and body health and performance.

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:23.380
 One issue with supplements, however,

1:51:23.380 --> 1:51:25.400
 is that many of the supplements out there

1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:28.140
 simply do not contain what's listed on the bottle

1:51:28.140 --> 1:51:31.900
 and or the quality of the ingredients is not very high.

1:51:31.900 --> 1:51:34.140
 That's why we partnered with Thorne supplements.

1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:36.740
 Thorne supplements are used by all the major sports teams

1:51:36.740 --> 1:51:38.860
 and they partnered with the Mayo Clinic.

1:51:38.860 --> 1:51:41.060
 The reason they have so many high-level partners

1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:42.340
 is that Thorne supplements

1:51:42.340 --> 1:51:44.740
 are of the very highest quality ingredients.

1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:46.820
 They also are extremely precise

1:51:46.820 --> 1:51:48.780
 in terms of what's listed on the bottle

1:51:48.780 --> 1:51:50.540
 is always what's in the bottle.

1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:52.640
 If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,

1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:55.740
 you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com

1:51:55.740 --> 1:51:57.820

1:51:57.820 --> 1:52:00.140
 and there you can see the Thorne supplements that I take

1:52:00.140 --> 1:52:02.620

 I cover science and science-related tools,

1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:26.020
 some of which overlap with the content of this podcast,

1:52:26.020 --> 1:52:28.680
 other of which does not and is unique content.

1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:30.220
