00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.260
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.260 --> 00:12.940
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.940 --> 00:14.880
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.260
 Today, my guest is Dr. Paul Conte.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.720
 Dr. Conte is a psychiatrist who did his training

00:19.720 --> 00:21.300
 at Stanford School of Medicine,

00:21.300 --> 00:22.980
 and then went on to be chief resident

00:22.980 --> 00:24.300
 at Harvard Medical School.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.360
 He now runs the Pacific Premier Group,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.820
 which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists

00:28.820 --> 00:31.520
 focusing on solving complex human problems,

00:31.520 --> 00:34.040
 including trauma, addiction, personality,

00:34.040 --> 00:35.960
 and psychiatric disorders.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.380
 Today, we discuss trauma in detail

00:38.380 --> 00:40.900
 and the therapeutic process in detail.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.320
 For instance, we discuss what is trauma?

00:43.320 --> 00:45.460
 How do you know if you have trauma?

00:45.460 --> 00:47.340
 Dr. Conte shares with us, for instance,

00:47.340 --> 00:49.580
 that not every experience that we think is traumatic

00:49.580 --> 00:50.940
 is necessarily traumatic,

00:50.940 --> 00:53.340
 and yet many people might have trauma

00:53.340 --> 00:54.820
 without even realizing it.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.300
 We also talk about the therapeutic process generally,

00:57.300 --> 00:59.180
 for instance, how to pick a therapist,

00:59.180 --> 01:01.500
 how to best approach and go through therapy,

01:01.500 --> 01:03.600
 and how to evaluate whether or not therapy

01:03.600 --> 01:06.460
 and your relationship to the therapist is working or not.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.060
 We also talk about self-therapies

01:08.060 --> 01:10.740
 because we acknowledge that not everyone has access to

01:10.740 --> 01:12.620
 or can afford therapy.

01:12.620 --> 01:14.900
 And we talk about drug therapies,

01:14.900 --> 01:17.920
 for instance, antidepressants, antipsychotics.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.220
 We talk about alcohol, cannabis, ketamine,

01:21.220 --> 01:24.840
 and the psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD,

01:24.840 --> 01:27.420
 and we talk about the clinical use of MDMA

01:27.420 --> 01:29.200
 and what the future of that looks like.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.680
 The reason for bringing Dr. Conte onto this podcast

01:31.680 --> 01:35.700
 is because I see him as the person who has the greatest

01:35.700 --> 01:39.060
 and most holistic view of therapy, trauma,

01:39.060 --> 01:41.020
 drug therapies, talk therapies,

01:41.020 --> 01:44.520
 and how self-therapy and work with others can be integrated

01:44.520 --> 01:47.860
 for both healing and growing from difficult circumstances.

01:47.860 --> 01:50.800
 Dr. Conte is also the author of an exceptional book

01:50.800 --> 01:53.520
 entitled, Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic,

01:53.520 --> 01:56.460
 How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.180
 That book describes trauma and its many features

01:59.180 --> 02:01.820
 and many tools, some of which we discuss

02:01.820 --> 02:03.320
 on the podcast today.

02:03.320 --> 02:06.100
 So whether or not you have trauma or not,

02:06.100 --> 02:07.340
 by the end of today's episode,

02:07.340 --> 02:09.180
 you will have a much deeper understanding

02:09.180 --> 02:10.740
 about what trauma is.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.780
 In fact, I'm confident that you will gain insight

02:12.780 --> 02:14.980
 into whether or not you have trauma or not,

02:14.980 --> 02:17.260
 whether or not people close to you have trauma or not,

02:17.260 --> 02:19.300
 and the various paths to recovering

02:19.300 --> 02:22.380
 and indeed growing from trauma that we can all take.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.920
 As you will soon learn, Dr. Conte

02:23.920 --> 02:27.480
 is an exceptional communicator and has a unique window

02:27.480 --> 02:29.740
 into the trauma and therapeutic process

02:29.740 --> 02:32.220
 that I know that all of us can benefit from.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.740
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:34.740 --> 02:37.500
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:39.500 --> 02:41.960
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:41.960 --> 02:44.700
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.820
 In keeping with that theme,

02:45.820 --> 02:48.540
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.420
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.380
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

02:52.380 --> 02:54.680
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.620
 The company was founded

02:55.620 --> 02:57.960
 by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,

02:57.960 --> 03:00.620
 and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:00.620 --> 03:02.940
 was designed with performance in mind.

03:02.940 --> 03:04.820
 I spent a lifetime working on the visual system,

03:04.820 --> 03:06.100
 and I can tell you that our visual system

03:06.100 --> 03:08.380
 has to contend with a lot of different challenges.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.500
 For instance, when you move from a shady area

03:10.500 --> 03:12.100
 to a brightly lit area,

03:12.100 --> 03:13.640
 your eyes and your brain have to adjust

03:13.640 --> 03:15.620
 in order for you to be able to see clearly.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.780
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed

03:17.780 --> 03:20.060
 with the biology of the visual system in mind,

03:20.060 --> 03:21.740
 so you never notice those transitions.

03:21.740 --> 03:22.700
 They're very seamless.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.060
 You always see things with perfect clarity.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.460
 The other terrific thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:27.460 --> 03:29.080
 is they are extremely lightweight.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.460
 Most of the time, I can't even remember

03:30.460 --> 03:31.340
 that I'm wearing them.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.420
 I wear readers at night,

03:32.420 --> 03:34.700
 and I wear sunglasses sometimes in the daytime

03:34.700 --> 03:37.320
 when it is very bright or I'm driving and so on.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.600
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.540

03:50.100 --> 03:53.060
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.420
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

03:55.420 --> 03:57.860
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

03:57.860 --> 03:59.380
 to help you better understand your body

03:59.380 --> 04:01.420
 and help you reach your health goals.

04:01.420 --> 04:04.300
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

04:04.300 --> 04:07.100
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

04:07.100 --> 04:09.420
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

04:09.420 --> 04:12.460
 can only be measured and assessed with a quality blood test.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.140
 And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,

04:15.140 --> 04:17.220
 we can also get insight into, for instance,

04:17.220 --> 04:19.540
 our biological age and see how that compares

04:19.540 --> 04:21.060
 to our chronological age.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.980
 And of course, despite what our birthday cake

04:23.980 --> 04:27.100
 screams back at us, it is our biological age

04:27.100 --> 04:28.940
 that really matters.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.280
 If you're going to get blood tests or DNA tests, however,

04:31.280 --> 04:32.780
 you need to be able to interpret the data,

04:32.780 --> 04:35.940
 and that's really where Inside Tracker stands apart.

04:35.940 --> 04:39.700
 A lot of companies will give you a DNA test or a blood test,

04:39.700 --> 04:42.460
 they'll send you values of hormones, metabolic markers,

04:42.460 --> 04:44.700
 et cetera, but you don't know what to do with those data.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.920
 Inside Tracker is a very easy-to-use platform.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.860
 So when you get the numbers back,

04:49.860 --> 04:51.620
 you can click on any of the numbers

04:51.620 --> 04:53.640
 that either are in range or out of range,

04:53.640 --> 04:55.260
 too low, too high, et cetera,

04:55.260 --> 04:58.180
 and it will direct you towards specific behavioral tools,

04:58.180 --> 05:00.420
 so lifestyle factors, nutritional tools,

05:00.420 --> 05:01.700
 supplement tools, et cetera,

05:01.700 --> 05:03.860
 that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges

05:03.860 --> 05:07.180
 that are best for you, which is really an exceptional tool

05:07.180 --> 05:09.420
 that makes all the blood tests and DNA tests

05:09.420 --> 05:11.660
 really exceptionally powerful.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.060
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:13.060 --> 05:15.660
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:15.660 --> 05:18.420

05:22.300 --> 05:25.180
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.

05:25.180 --> 05:28.260
 Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books

05:28.260 --> 05:31.180
 condensed down to just 15 minutes each of key takeaways

05:31.180 --> 05:32.460
 that you can read or listen to

05:32.460 --> 05:35.540
 to extract the most important knowledge from those books.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.300
 I love reading physical books,

05:37.300 --> 05:39.020
 literally physical hard copies of books,

05:39.020 --> 05:41.060
 and I like listening to audio books.

05:41.060 --> 05:42.660
 However, I also like to revisit books

05:42.660 --> 05:44.100
 that I've read or listened to.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.180
 And sometimes I just want to get the key points

05:46.180 --> 05:47.620
 or the key takeaways from a book

05:47.620 --> 05:49.620
 that I've never read or listened to.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.940
 Blinkist is terrific for all of that.

05:51.940 --> 05:55.220
 For instance, when researching our episodes on sleep,

05:55.220 --> 05:57.620
 one of the books that I read and found very valuable

05:57.620 --> 06:00.940
 is Matt Walker, professor at UC Berkeley's book,

06:00.940 --> 06:02.140
 Why We Sleep.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.060
 I've read that book,

06:03.060 --> 06:04.640
 but then I wanted to also make sure

06:04.640 --> 06:06.300
 that I hit the key takeaways.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.660
 Blinkist was essential for that.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.620
 Other books that I've read before and that I own and enjoy,

06:11.620 --> 06:14.380
 but I listened to the Blinkist version of From Time to Time

06:14.380 --> 06:17.020
 are things like Tim Ferriss' Four Hour Body

06:17.020 --> 06:20.180
 or Tim Ferriss' Four Hour Chef book,

06:20.180 --> 06:21.340
 both of which are excellent,

06:21.340 --> 06:23.700
 or Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.580
 And there are many other titles as well.

06:25.580 --> 06:26.700
 Blinkist is also a great way

06:26.700 --> 06:28.120
 to finally get through many of the books

06:28.120 --> 06:31.140
 that you've been meaning to read, but haven't had time for.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.020
 With Blinkist, you get unlimited access

06:33.020 --> 06:34.980
 to read or listen to a massive library

06:34.980 --> 06:36.860
 of condensed nonfiction books.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.820
 Right now, Blinkist has a special offer

06:38.820 --> 06:41.620
 just for our Huberman Lab podcast audience.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.020

06:58.180 --> 07:01.820
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte.

07:01.820 --> 07:03.780
 Paul, thank you so much for being here today.

07:03.780 --> 07:05.540
 Oh, thank you so much for having me.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.580
 I've been looking forward to this

07:07.580 --> 07:12.220
 and I've received a ton of questions about trauma,

07:12.220 --> 07:15.660
 about therapy, about how to assess where one is

07:15.660 --> 07:18.560
 in their own arc of problems

07:18.560 --> 07:21.580
 and addressing familial issues

07:21.580 --> 07:24.620
 and relationship issues and so forth.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.060
 We could just start off very basic

07:26.060 --> 07:27.700
 and just get everyone oriented.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.540
 Sure.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.180
 How should we define trauma?

07:31.180 --> 07:33.340
 We all have hard experiences.

07:33.340 --> 07:36.780
 Some of them we might ruminate on more than others,

07:36.780 --> 07:38.740
 but what is trauma?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.620
 To make the definition relevant,

07:42.620 --> 07:44.380
 I think we have to look at trauma

07:44.380 --> 07:47.660
 as not anything negative that happens to us, right,

07:47.660 --> 07:50.980
 but something that overwhelms our coping skills

07:50.980 --> 07:54.200
 and then leaves us different as we move forward.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.780
 So it changes the way that our brains function, right,

07:57.780 --> 07:59.780
 and then that change is evident in us

07:59.780 --> 08:01.560
 as we move forward through life.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.900
 So how do we know if we have trauma or not?

08:04.900 --> 08:07.820
 I've heard before everyone has trauma.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.740
 For instance, I've heard that if we are a child

08:11.740 --> 08:15.180
 or when we are a child and we request love from a parent

08:15.180 --> 08:16.920
 or attention from a parent,

08:16.920 --> 08:21.220
 if they dismiss us, that that's a microtrauma.

08:21.220 --> 08:25.360
 Is that overstating or unfair to the real issue of trauma?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.900
 Do we all have trauma?

08:27.900 --> 08:29.140
 What are microtraumas?

08:29.140 --> 08:30.540
 What are macrotraumas?

08:30.540 --> 08:31.360
 Right.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.460
 I think traumas that we might categorize

08:34.460 --> 08:35.940
 as disappointments, right,

08:35.940 --> 08:40.220
 or things that are negative but not deeply impactful,

08:40.220 --> 08:43.240
 I think is not a helpful definition, right?

08:43.240 --> 08:45.220
 I think the helpful definition is something

08:45.220 --> 08:48.760
 that rises to the magnitude of really changing us

08:48.760 --> 08:52.420
 and something that we can see both in how we behave,

08:52.420 --> 08:54.820
 we can see it in mood, anxiety, behavior,

08:54.820 --> 08:58.020
 sleep, physical health, so we can identify it

08:58.020 --> 09:00.540
 and we can also see it in brain changes.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.860
 So the fact that we become, say, more hypervigilant, right,

09:03.860 --> 09:05.980
 more vigilant and then we can see

09:05.980 --> 09:08.540
 that different parts of the brain are more active.

09:08.540 --> 09:13.540
 So that definition, that definition captures how trauma,

09:14.660 --> 09:16.480
 if it rises to a certain level,

09:16.480 --> 09:17.780
 like what we would say trauma

09:17.780 --> 09:20.140
 that makes a post-trauma syndrome, right,

09:20.140 --> 09:23.540
 leaves us different, I think is the helpful definition

09:23.540 --> 09:25.900
 of trauma because it's a clinical definition, right?

09:25.900 --> 09:30.660
 It's changes in us as people and we can map those changes

09:30.660 --> 09:33.940
 to identifiable shifts in our brain function.

09:34.860 --> 09:38.280
 So how do we know if we've been changed by something?

09:39.300 --> 09:42.420
 I mean, I can think back to childhood events

09:42.420 --> 09:45.380
 where some kid on the playground or in the classroom

09:45.380 --> 09:48.820
 said something I didn't like, something negative about me.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.060
 I think most people can do that.

09:50.060 --> 09:54.100
 We have a great memory for the kid that said something awful

09:54.100 --> 09:56.100
 or the parent or teacher that said something awful

09:56.100 --> 09:57.740
 that really felt like it hurt us

09:57.740 --> 09:59.500
 or at least it stuck with us.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.460
 So clearly one's brain, my brain in this example,

10:03.460 --> 10:08.040
 has been changed by that event such that I remember it.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.380
 But how do we know if something

10:09.380 --> 10:11.580
 has actually changed the way that we are

10:11.580 --> 10:14.620
 because of course we don't know how we would be otherwise?

10:14.620 --> 10:18.500
 Right, that's difficult, right?

10:18.500 --> 10:22.100
 It's doable, but it's difficult because the response.

10:22.100 --> 10:25.300
 So if the trauma rises to the level of changing our brains,

10:25.300 --> 10:27.700
 and I don't just mean like we have a new memory, right?

10:27.700 --> 10:30.300
 So we can have memories of something that was negative.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.980
 And in that sense, it changes the brain

10:31.980 --> 10:34.600
 because now there's something we can call to mind,

10:34.600 --> 10:37.740
 but it doesn't change the functioning of the brain.

10:37.740 --> 10:41.740
 If trauma rises to the level of changing the functioning

10:41.740 --> 10:45.140
 of our brains, then there's almost always a reflex

10:45.140 --> 10:49.700
 of guilt and shame around the trauma that can lead us

10:49.700 --> 10:53.900
 and often leads us to bury it, to avoid it,

10:53.900 --> 10:57.420
 to feel that now there's something negative inside of me

10:57.420 --> 11:01.500
 and it feels shameful or it feels

11:01.500 --> 11:03.740
 like no one else would accept it, right?

11:03.740 --> 11:07.200
 So what happens is people tend to avoid looking

11:07.200 --> 11:10.580
 at the change in them, which is exactly the opposite

11:10.580 --> 11:11.800
 of what needs to be done, right?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.940
 The idea of in a viral pandemic, right?

11:13.940 --> 11:16.740
 We wanna stay away from one another and isolate, right?

11:16.740 --> 11:19.340
 But with the trauma epidemic,

11:19.340 --> 11:22.140
 we need to communicate with other people.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.020
 We need to communicate and put words

11:24.020 --> 11:25.900
 to what's gone on inside of us.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.900
 And very often a person knows, I mean,

11:28.900 --> 11:32.760
 I've done so much clinical work over about 20 years

11:32.760 --> 11:34.860
 that has focused on trauma.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.280
 And a lot of the times the person knows, right?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.100
 But they're not admitting it to themselves

11:40.100 --> 11:41.260
 because they're afraid of it, right?

11:41.260 --> 11:42.740
 They don't know what to do.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.540
 But if they start talking,

11:44.540 --> 11:48.260
 then they'll talk about the event or the situation.

11:48.260 --> 11:51.140
 It could be something acute or it could be something chronic

11:51.140 --> 11:53.260
 that really has been harmful to them, right?

11:53.260 --> 11:55.380
 And then they feel different afterwards.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.820
 Like, oh, after that, I started thinking differently,

11:57.820 --> 12:00.460
 feeling differently, but that doesn't always happen.

12:00.460 --> 12:04.900
 Sometimes it's a process of exploration through dialogue,

12:04.900 --> 12:08.060
 right, whether it's written or whether it's spoken

12:08.060 --> 12:11.300
 of the person sort of exploring the changes

12:11.300 --> 12:12.120
 inside of themselves,

12:12.120 --> 12:14.480
 maybe changes to their self-talk inside,

12:14.480 --> 12:16.300
 changes to their thoughts about the world

12:16.300 --> 12:19.780
 and whether they can navigate safely and readily in it.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.200
 And it anchors, as I talk about this,

12:22.200 --> 12:23.820
 the example I'll use at times

12:23.820 --> 12:26.020
 is the example of my own life,

12:26.020 --> 12:29.900
 where when I was much younger, in my early 20s,

12:29.900 --> 12:33.220
 my younger brother took his life by suicide.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.180
 And the response of guilt and shame

12:36.180 --> 12:41.100
 and hiding all of it inside of me was,

12:41.100 --> 12:46.100
 it's just very dramatic, but I wasn't acknowledging it,

12:46.140 --> 12:47.780
 right, because I didn't know what to do about it.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.300
 And I felt guilty and I felt responsible

12:50.300 --> 12:51.660
 and I felt ashamed.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.420
 So there was an avoidance inside of me.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.220
 And then I wasn't saying to myself,

12:56.220 --> 12:59.060
 hey, before this, you thought that you could be effective

12:59.060 --> 13:00.460
 and you could make your way in the world.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.900
 And if you were a good person and you worked hard,

13:02.900 --> 13:04.460
 you could make a difference, right?

13:04.460 --> 13:07.580
 And then afterwards I thought, I can't get anywhere.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.980
 The world's against me.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.500
 And I felt like, oh, my options are all gone.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.540
 And I was like 24 years old, right?

13:14.540 --> 13:18.020
 So I didn't see that the change was in me,

13:18.020 --> 13:20.420
 but I was taking care of myself poorly.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.940
 Like there was enough going on that was unhealthy

13:22.940 --> 13:25.100
 that I couldn't avoid the realization that like,

13:25.100 --> 13:27.260
 hey, I'm different now.

13:27.260 --> 13:29.180
 And in these ways that are automatic,

13:29.180 --> 13:31.900
 my reflex to, can I make my way in the world?

13:31.900 --> 13:32.940
 Can I have a good life?

13:32.940 --> 13:33.780
 Can I be happy?

13:33.780 --> 13:36.260
 My reflexes to that were all different.

13:36.260 --> 13:39.260
 And they were coming through the lens of heightened anxiety,

13:39.260 --> 13:42.500
 heightened vigilance, a sense of guilt, a sense of shame,

13:42.500 --> 13:45.300
 and a sense of non-belonging in the world.

13:45.300 --> 13:49.500
 And was ultimately good and helpful people around me

13:49.500 --> 13:50.740
 and my own realization.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.540
 And hey, things are not going well, right?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.500
 That led me to then get some help

13:54.500 --> 13:56.700
 and to be able to talk about it and realize like,

13:56.700 --> 13:58.820
 oh my gosh, I need to face these things

13:58.820 --> 14:00.940
 that are going on inside of me.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.520
 From a psychoanalytic, psychological,

14:04.520 --> 14:08.340
 and maybe even a neuroscience perspective, two questions.

14:08.340 --> 14:11.980
 Why do you think that when we experience trauma,

14:13.220 --> 14:16.580
 these things that we call guilt and shame surface,

14:16.580 --> 14:20.180
 you know, everything you're telling me is that

14:20.180 --> 14:22.500
 in the end, that's not adaptive.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.300
 Why would we be built that way?

14:26.220 --> 14:27.460
 So that's the first question.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.820
 And then the second question is,

14:29.820 --> 14:33.500
 you know, how should we conceptualize,

14:33.500 --> 14:35.160
 you know, guilt and shame?

14:35.160 --> 14:38.220
 You know, I think that we hear guilt, we hear shame.

14:38.220 --> 14:39.580
 You know, how should we think about it?

14:39.580 --> 14:44.580
 I mean, those emotions must exist in us for some reason.

14:44.580 --> 14:48.280
 But in this case, it seems like they don't serve us well.

14:48.280 --> 14:52.840
 So maybe in that order or in reverse order,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.600
 you know, what is guilt really?

14:54.600 --> 14:56.040
 What is shame really?

14:56.040 --> 14:59.760
 And why is it that we seem to be reflexively wired

14:59.760 --> 15:04.360
 to feel guilty and feel ashamed when that's the exact

15:04.360 --> 15:06.880
 opposite of what we need to do in the case of trauma?

15:06.880 --> 15:07.720
 Right, right.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.120
 No, I think these are great questions.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.220
 And I mean, I don't think anyone knows the answers for sure.

15:12.220 --> 15:16.040
 But my read of all of that is that there's something

15:16.040 --> 15:19.880
 adaptive that has happened in us through evolution

15:19.880 --> 15:24.080
 that now becomes maladaptive in the way we live

15:24.080 --> 15:25.440
 in the modern world, right?

15:25.440 --> 15:27.880
 So if you think of through most of human development,

15:27.880 --> 15:29.480
 you know, people weren't living that long, right?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.280
 And the idea was to survive and reproduce.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.520
 So traumatic things that happened to us,

15:35.520 --> 15:38.520
 it would make sense for them to stay with us, right?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.360
 So, you know, if you ate a new food and got really,

15:41.360 --> 15:44.500
 really sick, it's like, you better remember that, right?

15:44.500 --> 15:47.480
 You know, if you see someone from the group of people,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.200
 you know, a couple miles away, right?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.240
 And one of those people attacks you, right?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.120
 It's like, you better remember that.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.840
 So the traumatic things that are sort of emblazoned

15:56.840 --> 15:59.700
 in our brain are built to last, right?

15:59.700 --> 16:02.320
 Things that are positive will generate some emotion

16:02.320 --> 16:05.360
 inside of us, but things that are profoundly negative

16:05.360 --> 16:07.680
 are much more likely to stay with us.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.200
 And I think that that was adaptive, right?

16:10.200 --> 16:13.040
 When all of that was about survival, right?

16:13.040 --> 16:17.740
 And I think the same thing is true with, say, shame, right?

16:17.740 --> 16:21.120
 So I think here it makes sense to talk a little bit,

16:21.120 --> 16:23.100
 and actually I'm interested in your thoughts about this,

16:23.100 --> 16:25.640
 right, that the limbic system, right,

16:25.640 --> 16:28.280
 so the system often is called the emotion system, right,

16:28.280 --> 16:32.280
 in our brains has actually, of course, varying function,

16:32.280 --> 16:35.520
 right, and one aspect is affect, right?

16:35.520 --> 16:39.920
 So affect is aroused in us, which I think the meaning

16:39.920 --> 16:43.680
 then is it's created in us without our choice, right?

16:43.680 --> 16:47.160
 So if we're walking down the road and someone jumps

16:47.160 --> 16:49.240
 in front of us or pushes us, right,

16:49.240 --> 16:52.280
 then there's a response of fear, anger, right?

16:52.280 --> 16:56.320
 Heart starts beating faster, more blood to the muscles,

16:56.320 --> 16:59.960
 we're getting ready to fight, right, or run, right?

16:59.960 --> 17:02.440
 And then we become aware of it, right?

17:02.440 --> 17:07.440
 So the aroused affect in us is also about survival,

17:07.440 --> 17:09.940
 and it has a very deep impact upon us,

17:09.940 --> 17:12.860
 and shame is an aroused affect.

17:12.860 --> 17:16.180
 So it can be raised in us without our choice,

17:16.180 --> 17:19.100
 and it's very powerful, which if you think about that,

17:19.100 --> 17:22.060
 is an extremely strong deterrent, right?

17:22.060 --> 17:24.980
 So if you had, you know, imagine a tribe or a group

17:24.980 --> 17:27.780
 of people, right, that are sheltered together,

17:27.780 --> 17:31.300
 and, you know, someone eats half the food at night

17:31.300 --> 17:32.140
 or something, right?

17:32.140 --> 17:34.900
 And like, there's a very negative response, right,

17:34.900 --> 17:38.380
 and that person feels shame because shame is so powerful

17:38.380 --> 17:40.300
 to control behavior, right?

17:40.300 --> 17:43.560
 So the way that trauma can change our brains

17:43.560 --> 17:47.600
 and stay with us in a way that says, be more vigilant,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.420
 look at the world in a different way,

17:49.420 --> 17:53.580
 act more defensively, right, and how that links

17:53.580 --> 17:57.660
 to shame and to guilt, and then guilt becomes

17:57.660 --> 17:59.700
 what gets called feeling, technically,

17:59.700 --> 18:03.940
 where we relate the aroused affect to ourselves, right?

18:03.940 --> 18:07.900
 So shame, the aroused affect, and guilt, the next step,

18:07.900 --> 18:10.780
 right, when the shame gets related to self,

18:10.780 --> 18:13.860
 are such profound behavioral interventions

18:13.860 --> 18:16.820
 and deterrents, right, that you can see, I think,

18:16.820 --> 18:19.640
 how evolutionarily kind of all makes sense.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.660
 If we're fighting for survival, you know,

18:21.660 --> 18:24.780
 and we're an elder statesman, if we make it to 20, right,

18:24.780 --> 18:27.880
 this makes sense, but it doesn't make sense

18:27.880 --> 18:30.540
 in a world where we live much longer, right,

18:30.540 --> 18:33.060
 we navigate in all sorts of different ways,

18:33.060 --> 18:36.180
 and there's so much coming at us that can be traumatizing.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.820
 I mean, if you think about the news, right,

18:37.820 --> 18:40.020
 I mean, how many times have I written a prescription

18:40.020 --> 18:43.260
 for someone that says, no more news, right?

18:43.260 --> 18:44.100
 Or like-

18:44.100 --> 18:44.920
 You've actually written those prescriptions?

18:44.920 --> 18:47.180
 Oh, yeah, yes, so glance at the news,

18:47.180 --> 18:48.900
 like look at the news for news.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.820
 Anything going on, I need to know, right,

18:50.820 --> 18:53.820
 but what are people doing is they're looking at it

18:53.820 --> 18:55.060
 and they're clicking and they're clicking,

18:55.060 --> 18:58.600
 and there's a sense of being like enthralled

18:58.600 --> 19:01.720
 in a very frightening way with the horrors

19:01.720 --> 19:05.620
 that are in front of us, and it shows how, yes,

19:05.620 --> 19:08.880
 trauma can come through acute things that happen to us.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.460
 Trauma can come through chronic things,

19:10.460 --> 19:13.140
 chronic denigration, whether it's based upon

19:13.140 --> 19:16.620
 socioeconomic status, immigration status,

19:18.040 --> 19:21.780
 race, religion, sexuality, gender identity,

19:21.780 --> 19:25.780
 these chronic traumas, right, of being denigrated

19:25.780 --> 19:28.540
 by the society around us or treated as less than

19:28.540 --> 19:31.380
 can change the brain, but vicarious experiences

19:31.380 --> 19:34.620
 can too, right, and we know this, it's not theoretical.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.780
 We know that the changes in the brain can come

19:37.780 --> 19:40.360
 from vicarious experiences too, which is why

19:40.360 --> 19:42.620
 people who are glued to the news and then feeling like,

19:42.620 --> 19:44.820
 oh my goodness, like what is happening?

19:44.820 --> 19:48.580
 The mothers in the Ukraine who've lost babies in the war,

19:48.580 --> 19:50.860
 like there are things that are so terrifying

19:50.860 --> 19:53.440
 that if we spend so much time with that,

19:53.440 --> 19:54.740
 it has a similar effect.

19:54.740 --> 19:59.400
 So our brains are built to change from trauma,

19:59.400 --> 20:02.380
 but not in the way we experience trauma

20:02.380 --> 20:04.740
 and not in the way that we live life in terms of

20:04.740 --> 20:07.620
 the nature of living life and the duration of life

20:07.620 --> 20:10.940
 in the modern world where these traumas that happen to us

20:10.940 --> 20:14.460
 are often so bad for us because they change

20:14.460 --> 20:17.380
 how our brain is functioning and then our entire orientation

20:17.380 --> 20:20.760
 to the world is different and that could be for

20:20.760 --> 20:23.600
 years and years and decades and decades.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.180
 It brings so much misery and suffering

20:26.180 --> 20:28.000
 and at times it brings death.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.420
 If you think about 100,000 overdose deaths

20:31.420 --> 20:35.260
 in this country in a year, 100,000.

20:35.260 --> 20:38.540
 Where is so much of that arising from?

20:38.540 --> 20:41.660
 As a person who's treated addiction very intensively

20:41.660 --> 20:44.700
 over many years, I think that, well, I feel sure

20:44.700 --> 20:49.500
 that the majority of addiction that I see and treat

20:49.500 --> 20:53.340
 arises ultimately, the roots of it are in trauma

20:53.340 --> 20:56.300
 and are in trying to soothe something that's stuck inside

20:56.300 --> 20:57.740
 that the person isn't letting outside

20:57.740 --> 20:59.860
 because of the guilt and shame but it's running around

20:59.860 --> 21:01.860
 in their head and it's tormented by it

21:01.860 --> 21:05.220
 and now there's a pull for these drugs

21:05.220 --> 21:06.700
 or sometimes medicines to soothe.

21:06.700 --> 21:10.780
 So the opiates that were given after a minor surgery

21:10.780 --> 21:12.660
 are like, okay, yeah, they help the pain

21:12.660 --> 21:14.740
 from the minor surgery but what they're really helping

21:14.740 --> 21:16.740
 is the pain inside, right?

21:16.740 --> 21:20.780
 But that very quickly turns into addiction, danger, risk

21:20.780 --> 21:23.220
 and we see that over and over again

21:23.220 --> 21:25.820
 and not in a theoretical way.

21:25.820 --> 21:29.260
 Like I see that in people who have been in my practice

21:29.260 --> 21:31.920
 with addiction arising from trauma

21:31.920 --> 21:33.620
 who have subsequently died.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.980
 So it's sort of writ large in our existence

21:36.980 --> 21:38.580
 in the modern world.

21:38.580 --> 21:41.660
 Incredible to me that this is the way it works.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.700
 What I mean by that is this idea

21:46.700 --> 21:47.940
 that I've heard about before,

21:47.940 --> 21:49.900
 I think it was a Freudian concept

21:49.900 --> 21:51.900
 of a repetition compulsion.

21:51.900 --> 21:55.180
 That this is what boggles my mind

21:55.180 --> 21:56.540
 as I'm hearing this.

21:56.540 --> 22:00.780
 Something happens to us or we observe something traumatic

22:00.780 --> 22:03.260
 and instead of acknowledging that

22:03.260 --> 22:04.800
 and trying to distance from it,

22:04.800 --> 22:09.180
 there seems to be a reflex of shame and guilt in many cases

22:09.180 --> 22:14.140
 and stuffing it away and then a repetition of behaviors

22:14.140 --> 22:16.780
 to continue to try and to stuff it away.

22:16.780 --> 22:18.840
 Like you're trying to pack, I don't know,

22:18.840 --> 22:20.140
 recently I was packing a home

22:20.140 --> 22:23.100
 and trying to get a sleeping bag back into the bag.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.940
 It seems like it's always trying to mushroom out the top.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.660
 This kind of thing, it takes a lot of ongoing effort.

22:28.660 --> 22:32.500
 And at the same time that if this thing really exists,

22:32.500 --> 22:34.140
 this repetition compulsion,

22:34.140 --> 22:36.140
 people will return over and over again

22:36.140 --> 22:37.620
 to the kinds of scenarios

22:37.620 --> 22:39.240
 or at least the kinds of emotional states

22:39.240 --> 22:42.620
 that look just like the trauma or resemble it in some way.

22:42.620 --> 22:45.380
 So the question I have for you is,

22:45.380 --> 22:48.880
 is the repetition compulsion a real thing?

22:48.880 --> 22:52.420
 And why would we be wired that way?

22:52.420 --> 22:54.180
 My understanding of this concept

22:54.180 --> 22:55.300
 of the repetition compulsion

22:55.300 --> 22:58.700
 is that we all want to solve our traumas

22:58.700 --> 23:01.780
 and it allows us to put ourselves into micro

23:01.780 --> 23:05.980
 or again, macro versions of that over and over again.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.020
 We get to run the experiment again and again

23:08.020 --> 23:09.900
 in an attempt to solve it.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.900
 In the case of taking a drug that it's clear,

23:12.900 --> 23:14.240
 certain drugs like opioids,

23:14.240 --> 23:17.340
 it's clear how that would not allow us to deal with it.

23:17.340 --> 23:20.240
 It's just masking the emotional state.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.740
 But why is it, for instance, that somebody

23:22.740 --> 23:24.220
 who experiences sexual trauma

23:24.220 --> 23:26.600
 then places themselves into circumstances

23:26.600 --> 23:29.020
 of more sexual trauma?

23:29.020 --> 23:31.400
 Why is it that somebody who is in an abusive relationship

23:31.400 --> 23:32.900
 goes on to have a second and third

23:32.900 --> 23:36.300
 or fourth verbally or physically abusive relationship?

23:36.300 --> 23:37.140
 Yeah, I mean, on the face of it,

23:37.140 --> 23:38.820
 you just go, that makes no sense.

23:38.820 --> 23:42.540
 And yet we see this over and over and over again.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.300
 Yes, the first thing I would say

23:44.300 --> 23:47.980
 about the validity of the repetition compulsion concept

23:47.980 --> 23:51.140
 is a strong yes.

23:51.140 --> 23:53.580
 Like yes, we see that over and over.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.700
 It's not necessarily in everyone,

23:55.700 --> 24:00.380
 but boy, it is in a lot of people who have suffered trauma.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.920
 And I think there's a very good reason.

24:02.920 --> 24:06.340
 On the surface of it, it's like, it makes no sense.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.860
 But then if we think, well,

24:07.860 --> 24:11.140
 how does our brains actually function, right?

24:11.140 --> 24:14.700
 We're sort of trained, at least in Western society,

24:14.700 --> 24:17.900
 I think, to think of ourselves as logical creatures, right?

24:17.900 --> 24:19.300
 That like, oh, we're logical

24:19.300 --> 24:22.060
 and ultimately everything in us can just boil down to logic.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.740
 And if we think about it enough,

24:23.740 --> 24:27.200
 we're gonna understand how to make the right decisions,

24:27.200 --> 24:29.760
 which is completely not true, right?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.620
 That the limbic system, right?

24:31.620 --> 24:34.540
 The emotion system, so to speak, inside of us

24:34.540 --> 24:37.140
 always trumps logic, right?

24:37.140 --> 24:38.960
 If you think about, does it ever make sense

24:38.960 --> 24:40.620
 to run into a burning building?

24:40.620 --> 24:42.640
 I mean, logic says no, right?

24:42.640 --> 24:45.340
 But if someone you love is in the burning building,

24:45.340 --> 24:47.000
 people run right in, right?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.260
 Because the limbic system says yes.

24:49.260 --> 24:52.580
 So when logic and emotion come head to head,

24:52.580 --> 24:54.160
 emotion wins all the time.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.520
 If emotion is powerful enough, it will always win.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.620
 And so the limbic system is so important

25:00.620 --> 25:03.900
 and the limbic system does not care

25:03.900 --> 25:06.460
 about the clock or the calendar, right?

25:06.460 --> 25:07.600
 And that's the answer.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.540
 And I'll sort of say why to the repetition compulsion.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.660
 So the limbic system doesn't know like,

25:12.660 --> 25:16.340
 oh, it's now, it's today, it's May, it's 2022.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.220
 It just doesn't care at all, right?

25:18.220 --> 25:21.380
 So how I would relate that to the repetition compulsion

25:21.380 --> 25:25.740
 is when people are repeating, what they're trying to do

25:25.740 --> 25:28.120
 is to make things right, right?

25:28.120 --> 25:31.260
 With the idea that if we can repeat the situation

25:31.260 --> 25:34.800
 and make it right, it will fix everything, right?

25:34.800 --> 25:38.360
 Which makes perfect sense if we think,

25:38.360 --> 25:40.820
 well, where is that concept coming from, right?

25:40.820 --> 25:43.620
 It's coming from the emotional part of the brain

25:43.620 --> 25:46.620
 that wants relief from suffering of the trauma

25:46.620 --> 25:49.860
 and does not understand the clock or the calendar.

25:49.860 --> 25:52.220
 So if I can solve something now,

25:52.220 --> 25:55.160
 I will also solve something in the past, right?

25:55.160 --> 25:57.580
 Which is why I can't tell you how many times

25:57.580 --> 25:58.940
 I've sat with someone and say,

25:58.940 --> 26:01.100
 we're starting to do therapy, right?

26:01.100 --> 26:04.660
 And the person will say, oh, gosh, like, I know,

26:04.660 --> 26:06.020
 look, you just can't help me, right?

26:06.020 --> 26:10.020
 I mean, my last seven relationships have been abusive,

26:10.020 --> 26:13.320
 right, and I'll say back something sometimes like,

26:13.320 --> 26:15.100
 well, look, if you tell me

26:15.100 --> 26:16.660
 that you've had seven relationships

26:16.660 --> 26:18.920
 that have been abusive in different ways,

26:18.920 --> 26:19.760
 I'll agree with you.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.600
 Like, I only say that

26:20.600 --> 26:23.160
 because that's never what someone says, right?

26:23.160 --> 26:25.420
 But I think what you're gonna tell me is

26:25.420 --> 26:28.380
 you've kind of had the same relationship seven times.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.860
 It's not seven things, it's one, right?

26:30.860 --> 26:34.100
 And that's always, I don't think one time yet

26:34.100 --> 26:35.940
 that has failed to be the case.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.720
 And that's how, so if you think about it,

26:37.720 --> 26:41.260
 that's how we start to elucidate what's going on.

26:41.260 --> 26:43.260
 So the light bulb that goes off,

26:43.260 --> 26:47.100
 like I have not had seven different abusive relationships.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.300
 I have had one that I have repeated seven times.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.860
 And now we start getting to what's really going on

26:52.860 --> 26:53.940
 and what needs to happen.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.800
 That person needs to face what happened

26:56.800 --> 26:58.700
 in that original abusive relationship.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.860
 And it always comes down to the same sort of concepts

27:01.860 --> 27:04.320
 of the person feeling terrified

27:04.320 --> 27:05.820
 while the abuse was going on,

27:05.820 --> 27:08.100
 feeling guilty, feeling ashamed,

27:08.100 --> 27:10.040
 feeling like, oh, they brought it on themselves,

27:10.040 --> 27:12.660
 they deserve it, they don't deserve anything better, right?

27:12.660 --> 27:15.460
 Because the brain is trying to make sense of it, right?

27:15.460 --> 27:18.560
 Or I thought I could make that okay, but I couldn't, right?

27:18.560 --> 27:20.820
 And then there's more guilt and more shame.

27:20.820 --> 27:23.260
 And if that's stuck inside of someone,

27:23.260 --> 27:25.820
 like that's bundled up inside of someone,

27:25.820 --> 27:28.380
 like a medical abscess inside a person,

27:28.380 --> 27:30.980
 a walled off infection inside the body,

27:30.980 --> 27:33.740
 this is the same concept in the brain,

27:33.740 --> 27:36.260
 then of course the limbic system is gonna wanna fix that

27:36.260 --> 27:39.780
 and it fixes it by trying to let's recreate that situation

27:39.780 --> 27:41.540
 and make it right this time.

27:41.540 --> 27:44.220
 And that's, I mean, it's I think one of the best examples

27:44.220 --> 27:47.260
 of how the right approach of how like, let's look at that,

27:47.260 --> 27:48.820
 let's talk about that, right?

27:48.820 --> 27:49.940
 What's really going on there?

27:49.940 --> 27:51.580
 Wait, who should feel guilty and ashamed?

27:51.580 --> 27:52.860
 Is it the person who was abused

27:52.860 --> 27:55.060
 or the person who was abusing, right?

27:55.060 --> 27:57.860
 And we can get at what's going on inside the person

27:57.860 --> 27:59.140
 and that's what changes that.

27:59.140 --> 28:01.660
 And then the eighth relationship can be entirely different

28:01.660 --> 28:03.040
 than the first seven, right?

28:03.040 --> 28:04.400
 And I see that all the time.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.820
 I mean, this isn't esoteric or soft.

28:06.820 --> 28:11.380
 Like I see that play out clinically over and over again

28:11.380 --> 28:12.740
 and why do things get better?

28:12.740 --> 28:16.460
 Because we go to the trauma and we unlock it.

28:16.460 --> 28:20.020
 It's not hidden inside where it can control things, right?

28:20.020 --> 28:21.340
 We bring it to the surface

28:21.340 --> 28:24.000
 and then we can take away its power.

28:24.940 --> 28:28.620
 I keep hearing in this narrative

28:28.620 --> 28:33.620
 that so much of our reflexive response to trauma,

28:33.620 --> 28:36.580
 both emotional and the repetition compulsion

28:36.580 --> 28:41.380
 in terms of behaviors is about some very deep attempt

28:41.380 --> 28:42.940
 to change the past.

28:42.940 --> 28:44.080
 Yes.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.940
 And in fact, in an offline conversation,

28:45.940 --> 28:49.380
 I recall you saying something about this,

28:49.380 --> 28:53.160
 that the number of behaviors and thoughts

28:53.160 --> 28:56.200
 and avoidance of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts

28:56.200 --> 28:59.460
 that human beings put in to try and change the past

28:59.460 --> 29:04.460
 is remarkable and eerie and maladaptive, it sounds like.

29:04.460 --> 29:05.900
 And that really stuck with me

29:05.900 --> 29:10.140
 because I think we all want to feel like we're in control

29:10.140 --> 29:13.020
 of our future and how we feel in the moment.

29:13.020 --> 29:17.260
 And to some extent, it works for a brief while.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.860
 There's this thing that happened

29:18.860 --> 29:22.420
 and it just evokes some internal arousal.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.940
 And then you have to know what to do with that arousal.

29:24.940 --> 29:27.500
 And I think for many people, including myself,

29:27.500 --> 29:30.380
 there's this fundamental question, okay,

29:30.380 --> 29:32.940
 the thought about the thing, the event,

29:32.940 --> 29:36.940
 or events, plural, evokes this arousal, this internal state,

29:36.940 --> 29:38.940
 makes some people feel sleepy and exhausted.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.940
 Other people feel really anxious.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.060
 Other people feel angry.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.780
 I mean, the arousal has all these different dimensions

29:44.780 --> 29:47.260
 as you know.

29:47.260 --> 29:49.660
 And then there's this question about what to do with it.

29:49.660 --> 29:54.660
 And I'd love to hear maybe even just a top contour

29:55.660 --> 29:57.740
 prescriptive of what does one do?

29:57.740 --> 29:59.060
 I'll even just put myself in it.

29:59.060 --> 29:59.900
 What do I do?

29:59.900 --> 30:01.020
 So I'm feeling upset.

30:01.020 --> 30:05.660
 Should I feel like my options are healthy catharsis?

30:05.660 --> 30:08.380
 I could tell the story, feel it.

30:08.380 --> 30:12.140
 I could pack it down.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.820
 We hear that it's bad to pack it down,

30:13.820 --> 30:15.900
 but of course one has to be functional in life

30:15.900 --> 30:17.180
 and deal with things.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.420
 And we have responsibilities at work

30:19.420 --> 30:23.100
 and relational responsibilities, et cetera.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.540
 We need to sleep at night.

30:24.540 --> 30:28.460
 So catharsis, healthy catharsis, packing it down

30:28.460 --> 30:29.820
 at the end of the day,

30:29.820 --> 30:34.700
 packing it down at the other extreme, telling the story.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.860
 And yet I think a lot of people are afraid to tell the story

30:36.860 --> 30:39.020
 because in that telling,

30:39.020 --> 30:42.140
 there's perhaps a re-emergence of the arousal.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.500
 The arousal can become greater.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.900
 I mean, is that what people mean when they say things

30:45.900 --> 30:47.420
 are going to get worse before they get better?

30:47.420 --> 30:49.580
 I mean, so I guess the simple version

30:49.580 --> 30:52.860
 of this long-winded question is it's clear

30:52.860 --> 30:54.220
 we need to confront these things.

30:54.860 --> 30:59.020
 We can't change the past by a reflexive response

30:59.020 --> 31:00.380
 isn't going to do that efficiently.

31:00.940 --> 31:03.100
 And so how do we deal with arousal?

31:03.100 --> 31:05.340
 How does one take what they feel inside

31:05.340 --> 31:06.460
 about something shameful?

31:07.180 --> 31:09.340
 What do you do with it in a moment?

31:09.340 --> 31:11.340
 And does that have to be done in the presence

31:11.340 --> 31:13.420
 of a skilled trained therapist?

31:13.420 --> 31:16.380
 Or as I'm driving to work in the morning

31:16.380 --> 31:17.260
 and something comes up,

31:18.060 --> 31:20.540
 I can't deal with this right now, comes to mind.

31:20.540 --> 31:21.100
 What do I do?

31:21.100 --> 31:22.220
 Do I deal with it right then?

31:22.780 --> 31:25.500
 I know this is a big multidimensional question,

31:25.500 --> 31:27.900
 but I think it's the one that a lot of people grapple with.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.020
 We want to deal with things.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.580
 How do we deal with that internal arousal?

31:31.580 --> 31:32.220
 Yeah, yeah.

31:33.020 --> 31:38.780
 We so often try and change the trauma of the past

31:38.780 --> 31:40.940
 in order to control the future.

31:40.940 --> 31:45.340
 And what that really adds up to is the trauma of the past

31:45.340 --> 31:47.740
 dominates our present, right?

31:47.740 --> 31:49.580
 And it doesn't have to be that way.

31:49.580 --> 31:51.740
 And remember, we're talking about traumas

31:51.740 --> 31:53.980
 that rise to the level of changing the brain.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.460
 So as you're saying, that involves re-experience.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.660
 It involves hyper-vigilance, increased arousal,

31:59.660 --> 32:01.980
 changes in mood states, changes in anxiety,

32:01.980 --> 32:04.300
 changes in sleep, changes in behavior.

32:04.300 --> 32:08.380
 So these are all changes that, in a sense,

32:08.380 --> 32:11.180
 push towards dominating our present, right?

32:11.180 --> 32:14.460
 And then we're not really living in the present, right,

32:14.460 --> 32:16.220
 as we're trying to control the future.

32:16.220 --> 32:18.620
 We're not going to do a great job of controlling our future

32:18.620 --> 32:21.580
 if we're not really living in the present, right?

32:21.580 --> 32:23.660
 And so the way to come at that,

32:24.300 --> 32:25.660
 again, in the moment, if we're saying,

32:25.660 --> 32:28.060
 okay, at the moment, if I need to fall asleep, right,

32:28.060 --> 32:29.820
 I might say, okay, let me try and put that out of my mind.

32:29.820 --> 32:31.500
 Let me try and thought redirect.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.020
 So there are short-term strategies

32:33.020 --> 32:36.300
 that can let us be functional in the context of these changes.

32:36.300 --> 32:42.380
 But the answer is to go look directly at that thing, right?

32:42.380 --> 32:45.740
 Look at that trauma, explore that trauma.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.500
 And sure, that can be done with a professional.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.660
 And sometimes that's what makes sense.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.020
 But not always, right?

32:51.020 --> 32:53.740
 Sometimes it can be done by talking to another person,

32:53.740 --> 32:55.260
 right, writing it down, right?

32:55.260 --> 32:57.660
 Look at what's going on inside of me

32:57.660 --> 33:00.460
 that my mind is so stuck to this.

33:00.460 --> 33:01.580
 Let's explore that.

33:01.580 --> 33:06.780
 Because it's almost as if we're so afraid so often

33:06.780 --> 33:09.900
 of looking at the trauma that has changed us

33:10.620 --> 33:14.300
 that we'll look anywhere but at that, right?

33:14.300 --> 33:15.980
 So it's like it's hidden in a closet

33:15.980 --> 33:17.900
 and we'll shine the light everywhere else,

33:17.900 --> 33:19.820
 but we're not going to open that door.

33:19.820 --> 33:21.820
 And that's where people will say the same

33:21.820 --> 33:22.940
 as I've heard over and over.

33:22.940 --> 33:24.540
 And I myself have thought this at times,

33:24.540 --> 33:25.980
 like, oh, if I talk about that,

33:25.980 --> 33:27.980
 I'm going to start crying and never stop, right?

33:27.980 --> 33:29.900
 Or I'm going to just fall apart, right?

33:29.900 --> 33:30.940
 Which is never what happens.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.340
 No one ever starts crying and never stops, right?

33:33.340 --> 33:37.180
 What ends up happening is when the person puts words to it,

33:37.180 --> 33:38.380
 right, it could be in writing,

33:38.380 --> 33:41.340
 it could be talking to a trusted other or with a therapist,

33:41.340 --> 33:42.860
 right, things start to change.

33:42.860 --> 33:45.740
 I mean, just the fact that you can talk about it,

33:45.740 --> 33:48.700
 you can put words to it and other people don't recoil, right?

33:48.700 --> 33:51.340
 I mean, how many times has someone said something

33:51.340 --> 33:53.180
 for the first time, right?

33:53.180 --> 33:55.580
 And when they're telling me about the trauma,

33:56.860 --> 33:58.860
 there's such an anxious like,

33:58.860 --> 34:03.180
 looking like as if I'm going to recoil from it, right?

34:03.180 --> 34:05.900
 Meaning I'm going to recoil from them, right?

34:05.900 --> 34:07.420
 And then there's a sense of surprise.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.740
 If the person says, well, you know,

34:09.740 --> 34:13.500
 I was abused by this coach when I was a kid, right?

34:14.700 --> 34:18.860
 And there's not, okay, there's not a response of recoiling.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.900
 You can see the change and people will say a lot like,

34:21.900 --> 34:24.380
 wow, like, I can't believe like,

34:25.260 --> 34:28.220
 you can like hear me say that and be okay with it, right?

34:28.220 --> 34:30.380
 I mean, so you think about what's going on inside of them,

34:30.380 --> 34:34.380
 like how, what a sense of shame, a sense of, you know,

34:34.380 --> 34:38.380
 this is something awful about me for people to recoil from.

34:38.380 --> 34:42.140
 And it's just not true, but here's where trauma is,

34:42.140 --> 34:43.820
 it's insidious, right?

34:43.820 --> 34:46.060
 And it's pervasive, right?

34:46.060 --> 34:50.540
 Because if that convinces us to continually hide it away,

34:50.540 --> 34:52.940
 then how do we explore it?

34:52.940 --> 34:56.300
 Like that, you know, that example of the person who says,

34:56.300 --> 34:58.860
 okay, I was abused by a coach when I was a child.

34:58.860 --> 35:02.220
 I mean, I'm thinking of a couple of very real cases, right?

35:02.220 --> 35:03.900
 People that I've taken care of.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.660
 And once they start talking about it,

35:05.660 --> 35:08.780
 then they start talking about how, you know,

35:08.780 --> 35:10.780
 they were just innocent kids, right?

35:10.780 --> 35:11.980
 And like, they didn't know.

35:11.980 --> 35:13.580
 And like, they really wanted to be on the team

35:13.580 --> 35:16.060
 where this coach was treating them as special.

35:16.060 --> 35:19.340
 And now they can look at themselves from the outside, right?

35:19.340 --> 35:21.500
 They can look at themselves like they would look

35:21.500 --> 35:23.180
 at someone else, right?

35:23.180 --> 35:27.660
 You think it's so easy for us to see what's real and true

35:27.660 --> 35:28.940
 if it's someone else, right?

35:28.940 --> 35:29.980
 If you ask someone, you know,

35:29.980 --> 35:32.780
 what do you think of someone who's 10, 11 years old,

35:32.780 --> 35:35.660
 who's abused and manipulated and abused by an adult?

35:35.660 --> 35:36.620
 We say, oh my goodness,

35:36.620 --> 35:38.940
 I feel compassion for that person, right?

35:38.940 --> 35:41.020
 But if it's us, right?

35:41.020 --> 35:42.940
 Then, oh no, it's guilt and shame

35:42.940 --> 35:44.300
 and we have to hide it away.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.060
 And when the person starts looking at it,

35:46.060 --> 35:48.300
 they can sort of see it from the outside

35:48.300 --> 35:51.020
 and it starts to take the energy out of it, right?

35:51.020 --> 35:52.860
 Then, well, who should feel guilty about that?

35:52.860 --> 35:54.460
 Who's done something wrong?

35:54.460 --> 35:56.780
 And like, so now the conceptions come together,

35:56.780 --> 35:59.580
 which is often a reflexive, that was my fault.

35:59.580 --> 36:00.380
 Oh, I did it.

36:00.380 --> 36:01.900
 I went back to it.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.740
 I still stayed on the team.

36:03.740 --> 36:05.340
 I went back next season, right?

36:05.340 --> 36:07.020
 I let it happen again, right?

36:07.020 --> 36:10.220
 All the guilt and shame inside the person gets juxtaposed

36:10.220 --> 36:11.900
 to like, what really happened there?

36:11.900 --> 36:14.940
 And then they say, right, I was a terrified child, right?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.540
 I didn't understand at all.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.780
 And they can come to a place of compassion.

36:18.780 --> 36:21.580
 And now we are working against the guilt and shame.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.940
 And if the person cries about it, that's great, right?

36:24.940 --> 36:26.300
 I mean, crying is one of the best

36:26.300 --> 36:28.060
 coping mechanisms we have.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.100
 It doesn't hurt us and it lets us grieve things.

36:31.100 --> 36:34.380
 We can't grieve if there's guilt and shame inside of us.

36:34.380 --> 36:36.300
 It just blocks grief, right?

36:36.300 --> 36:38.860
 We have to, it has to be a clean slate in a sense,

36:38.860 --> 36:40.700
 in order to feel sadness.

36:40.700 --> 36:44.460
 And then you see that it shifts from anxiety,

36:44.460 --> 36:47.340
 anger and frustration, usually directed towards the self,

36:47.340 --> 36:51.580
 guilt and shame, towards being able to process it

36:51.580 --> 36:54.860
 and being able to bring to bear some compassion

36:54.860 --> 36:57.500
 and being able to direct the negative emotion,

36:57.500 --> 36:59.980
 so to speak, where they're warranted.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.860
 And my goodness, the changes that happen.

37:02.860 --> 37:05.820
 I mean, it's not like people are miraculously cured, right?

37:05.820 --> 37:08.300
 But it's remarkable how just getting it out there

37:08.300 --> 37:11.020
 and having like one hour of talking like that,

37:11.020 --> 37:14.700
 like what we're talking about now can leave a person

37:14.700 --> 37:16.060
 feeling immensely better.

37:17.260 --> 37:19.260
 It seems to me in hearing this that there's this

37:20.860 --> 37:23.100
 weird wiring that we have.

37:23.100 --> 37:26.060
 Because what I'm hearing is when traumas happen to us

37:26.060 --> 37:28.300
 or we observe them, what we need to do most

37:28.300 --> 37:31.580
 is to confront those and the emotions around that directly.

37:32.300 --> 37:35.180
 But instead our system defaults to guilt, shame,

37:35.740 --> 37:36.620
 and trying to hide it.

37:37.260 --> 37:40.460
 And this repetition compulsion of placing us back

37:40.460 --> 37:43.420
 into things similar to those traumas,

37:43.420 --> 37:47.100
 or even maybe even worse traumas in an attempt to resolve it.

37:47.100 --> 37:50.780
 It's like the most maladaptive wiring diagram

37:50.780 --> 37:52.220
 I could possibly think of.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.660
 Emotional and presumably physiological wiring diagram.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.740
 And this notion of trying to change the past

37:59.740 --> 38:02.780
 by doing things now when the exact opposite

38:02.780 --> 38:04.700
 is what's going to be beneficial,

38:04.700 --> 38:08.060
 also seems like the whole system seems completely backwards.

38:08.060 --> 38:11.260
 And I'm chuckling as I said, it's not because I'm amused,

38:11.260 --> 38:13.100
 it's because I'm just baffled once again

38:13.100 --> 38:15.820
 at how our wiring can often not serve us well.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.740
 But it raises what I think is an important

38:21.740 --> 38:24.460
 and interesting question, which is earlier you were talking

38:24.460 --> 38:27.660
 about how people will seek out media

38:27.660 --> 38:28.700
 that's really disturbing.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.020
 They'll traumatize and re-traumatize themselves

38:31.020 --> 38:32.060
 on a daily basis.

38:32.620 --> 38:35.260
 So that could be viewed as the repetition compulsion

38:35.260 --> 38:37.740
 where the person will have the same relationship

38:37.740 --> 38:40.380
 with seven different, same abusive relationship

38:40.380 --> 38:42.140
 with seven different partners in sequence.

38:43.420 --> 38:44.140
 Seems terrible.

38:44.140 --> 38:48.460
 And yet, as I say this, it also is becoming clear to me

38:48.460 --> 38:52.380
 how this almost seems like a poor but desperate attempt

38:52.380 --> 38:54.540
 to resolve it in some way.

38:55.100 --> 38:59.900
 And so the fork in the road, if I understand correctly,

38:59.900 --> 39:03.420
 is to really get to the seed incident,

39:03.420 --> 39:05.500
 really get to the thing that started it all,

39:05.500 --> 39:07.420
 as opposed to repeating it all.

39:07.420 --> 39:07.920
 Yes.

39:09.820 --> 39:12.300
 Does that have to be done in the presence of a therapist?

39:13.980 --> 39:16.860
 Is there benefit to taking a walk

39:16.860 --> 39:19.580
 and thinking about these things, breaking down

39:19.580 --> 39:21.260
 and crying if that's what's necessary,

39:21.980 --> 39:24.780
 or feeling angry if that's what comes up?

39:25.660 --> 39:30.620
 The reason I ask it this way is because I worry,

39:31.500 --> 39:34.060
 I'll just speak to my own experience,

39:34.060 --> 39:37.340
 I worry that in reactivating or touching into the emotion

39:37.340 --> 39:40.220
 around something, that that is itself a form

39:40.220 --> 39:41.500
 of the repetition compulsion,

39:41.500 --> 39:43.260
 because you're feeling it all over again.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.460
 You're not seeking out something to evoke that feeling.

39:46.460 --> 39:49.180
 So I realize this is a little bit of a circular argument

39:50.460 --> 39:53.340
 or question, but I think it's one that I really struggle

39:53.340 --> 40:00.380
 with in trying to parse all the outcome-based therapies

40:00.380 --> 40:03.820
 that I hear about and the recommendations

40:03.820 --> 40:04.620
 that people make.

40:04.620 --> 40:06.620
 I mean, how should we conceptualize this?

40:06.620 --> 40:07.820
 Something happens.

40:07.820 --> 40:10.220
 It sounds like we need to deal with that thing directly.

40:10.220 --> 40:12.220
 Do we need to do that with somebody else?

40:12.220 --> 40:13.420
 Can we do that on our own?

40:13.420 --> 40:17.100
 If we don't have resources and we have to do it on our own,

40:17.980 --> 40:20.140
 can't hire someone, can't pay someone to work with us,

40:20.860 --> 40:23.900
 how do we do that in a way that isn't retraumatizing

40:23.900 --> 40:26.300
 ourself in a major way or in a minor way?

40:27.420 --> 40:30.540
 How do we know where we are in that landscape?

40:30.540 --> 40:31.040
 Right.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.500
 Again, those are, I think, great questions.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.780
 And I think it starts with real introspection.

40:37.340 --> 40:39.980
 When things are bouncing around in our minds,

40:39.980 --> 40:42.220
 often it's very non-productive, right?

40:42.220 --> 40:44.380
 It's the same thing over and over again.

40:44.940 --> 40:47.020
 And that's not helpful for us, right?

40:47.020 --> 40:49.260
 So there's an idea which sometimes gets called

40:49.260 --> 40:51.020
 an observing ego, right?

40:51.020 --> 40:53.100
 The ability to stop and look at what's going on

40:53.100 --> 40:54.460
 inside of ourselves.

40:54.460 --> 40:57.100
 And so if we're just thinking about it

40:57.100 --> 40:59.420
 and we're thinking in the same way we sort of, in a sense,

40:59.420 --> 41:01.500
 always think about it, then all we're doing

41:01.500 --> 41:03.340
 is reinforcing the trauma, right?

41:03.340 --> 41:05.820
 But if we can distance enough to be like,

41:05.820 --> 41:09.260
 huh, I'm interested in what's going on inside of me, right?

41:09.260 --> 41:13.660
 Like, I think of a certain person who really loves music.

41:13.660 --> 41:16.780
 And then at some point in our therapy work,

41:16.780 --> 41:19.980
 I learned, like, she was taking long drives,

41:19.980 --> 41:21.580
 but the radio wasn't on.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.420
 And I was like, well, what's going on, right?

41:23.420 --> 41:25.340
 And I asked, and what was going on?

41:25.340 --> 41:27.740
 And she was running over and over again in her head like,

41:27.740 --> 41:29.580
 I'm a loser, I'm a loser, right?

41:29.580 --> 41:32.540
 And she didn't want the music on because the music

41:32.540 --> 41:35.340
 would drown out what she felt she had to say to herself,

41:35.340 --> 41:36.060
 right?

41:36.060 --> 41:40.700
 And it was that like, wow, that's interesting, right?

41:40.700 --> 41:43.580
 And then her ability to observe that and to think,

41:44.140 --> 41:46.540
 why am I doing that when it comes into her mind?

41:46.540 --> 41:47.900
 Like, what is that trace to?

41:47.900 --> 41:49.180
 When did I start doing that?

41:49.180 --> 41:52.300
 Like I said, I'm saying it for a point of exaggeration.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.980
 Like, nobody comes out of the womb

41:55.420 --> 41:57.500
 programmed to think I'm a loser, right?

41:57.500 --> 41:59.420
 So we don't think that when we're born, right?

41:59.420 --> 42:01.260
 So where does that come from?

42:01.260 --> 42:05.500
 Then we can think in ways that allow us to have new thoughts,

42:05.500 --> 42:07.020
 right, that we weren't having.

42:07.020 --> 42:09.260
 It's not just bouncing around in our minds.

42:09.260 --> 42:13.020
 And if we speak or write, there are even more mechanisms

42:13.020 --> 42:15.180
 that come online in our brains, right,

42:15.180 --> 42:17.100
 that are then sort of monitoring mechanisms.

42:17.100 --> 42:21.020
 We think in a different way if we're using words, right?

42:21.020 --> 42:25.180
 And we are better able often to bring in that observing ego,

42:25.180 --> 42:26.620
 like what's going on inside of me?

42:27.180 --> 42:29.100
 So it can be very helpful to think.

42:29.100 --> 42:32.060
 It can be helpful to talk to someone, to a trusted other,

42:32.060 --> 42:35.420
 you know, friend, family, clergy, to write.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.340
 I mean, these are things that can be done

42:37.340 --> 42:39.740
 without expending any resources, right?

42:39.740 --> 42:43.020
 And sometimes it can make really a big difference, right?

42:43.020 --> 42:44.620
 There's a way, when did I start thinking that?

42:44.620 --> 42:46.140
 And like interestingly in this case,

42:46.140 --> 42:47.660
 okay, we did it in therapy,

42:47.660 --> 42:51.660
 but it became very clear what that was rooted to, right?

42:51.660 --> 42:54.620
 And then in the therapy, which was still relatively young,

42:54.620 --> 42:56.380
 but we'd done several sessions

42:56.380 --> 43:00.060
 and we weren't talking at all about what we needed to talk about, right?

43:00.060 --> 43:03.180
 But that's what got us to what we needed to talk about.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.380
 And when did that start?

43:04.380 --> 43:07.580
 And now we're in that same place of exploring that

43:07.580 --> 43:09.180
 and what was the reflex to it

43:09.180 --> 43:11.420
 and the sense of guilt and sense of shame.

43:11.420 --> 43:13.260
 And it's where all of that came from

43:13.260 --> 43:15.900
 that just got boiled down to I'm a loser, right?

43:15.900 --> 43:19.180
 Which this person didn't even have in their mind,

43:19.180 --> 43:21.980
 like I didn't think about myself that way, right?

43:21.980 --> 43:23.500
 And it's so interesting, right,

43:23.500 --> 43:26.700
 that our memories don't in and of themselves have meaning.

43:26.700 --> 43:30.220
 It's like they're flat or colorless, right?

43:30.220 --> 43:33.980
 And they're colored in by the emotions that we attach to them, right?

43:33.980 --> 43:39.100
 So the idea that certain memories now before the trauma

43:39.100 --> 43:41.500
 were changed, right, by the trauma.

43:41.500 --> 43:44.940
 So I tell the story sometimes of a person who like won an award

43:44.940 --> 43:46.780
 when they were in high school that they thought was,

43:46.780 --> 43:49.340
 oh my gosh, like it shows, like I can do it, right?

43:49.340 --> 43:51.740
 And get out there that after trauma,

43:51.740 --> 43:54.700
 they saw the award with a negative emotion attached to it

43:54.700 --> 43:57.180
 that was like, oh, it was given to me and I didn't deserve it.

43:57.180 --> 43:58.620
 And almost it was mocking,

43:58.620 --> 44:00.940
 like there's going to be the greatest achievement of my life

44:00.940 --> 44:02.540
 and I was 17 or so.

44:02.540 --> 44:05.100
 And to have someone think like that's not

44:05.100 --> 44:07.500
 how they felt about that at the time.

44:07.500 --> 44:11.340
 It's the trauma that changed the self-talk,

44:11.340 --> 44:13.900
 the internal state going forward.

44:13.900 --> 44:17.180
 And talking about miraculous in a negative way,

44:17.180 --> 44:20.140
 also changed that going backward, right?

44:20.140 --> 44:23.340
 And when we can really look at like where did that come from

44:23.340 --> 44:26.700
 and we can start unraveling it, it changes.

44:26.700 --> 44:29.420
 So in those cases, you know, often it's helpful

44:29.420 --> 44:31.420
 to have a good therapist.

44:31.420 --> 44:34.060
 It's not always necessary and it certainly,

44:34.060 --> 44:35.740
 it's not always possible, right?

44:35.740 --> 44:37.580
 So we need other strategies.

44:38.300 --> 44:40.460
 And some of those, I write about some of those in the book

44:40.460 --> 44:43.020
 of how can we sort of get at trauma

44:43.020 --> 44:44.860
 without those formalized mechanisms.

44:45.980 --> 44:48.540
 And sometimes if the symptoms are significant enough,

44:48.540 --> 44:51.020
 like we really do need to talk to somebody professional

44:51.020 --> 44:54.220
 who can help us get to the root of the trauma.

44:54.220 --> 44:56.860
 And there's so many times that's the answer

44:56.860 --> 44:58.380
 to what's going on with people.

44:58.380 --> 45:00.780
 You know, people I've seen have had five residential stays,

45:00.780 --> 45:03.580
 I'm not exaggerating this, for mental health reasons,

45:03.580 --> 45:04.780
 for substance reasons,

45:04.780 --> 45:07.500
 and no one's ever taken a trauma history, right?

45:07.500 --> 45:08.940
 And then when you take a trauma history, you say,

45:08.940 --> 45:11.820
 well, that's obviously where this is all coming from, right?

45:11.820 --> 45:14.140
 Like that's when the drug use started truly thereafter,

45:14.140 --> 45:16.060
 the negative self-talk and the negative feelings

45:16.060 --> 45:17.420
 that led to the drug use.

45:17.420 --> 45:21.180
 Then you go after the trauma and you can change things,

45:21.180 --> 45:24.140
 whereas trying to change things without looking,

45:24.140 --> 45:26.140
 introspecting, talking about the trauma,

45:27.500 --> 45:28.940
 I think of course was futile.

45:30.460 --> 45:34.780
 Do you think that people can start to have negative fantasies?

45:34.780 --> 45:35.740
 I mean, you mentioned this woman

45:35.740 --> 45:38.380
 who would take these long drives to berate herself.

45:39.580 --> 45:41.180
 I'm not familiar with that,

45:41.180 --> 45:43.580
 but I'll give a little bit of personal disclosure here.

45:43.580 --> 45:45.980
 I've felt several times in my life

45:45.980 --> 45:48.940
 that I will start to create a narrative

45:49.500 --> 45:51.900
 about something that truly hasn't happened,

45:51.900 --> 45:54.540
 about something terrible that somebody is going to do

45:55.660 --> 45:56.940
 that's going to upset me.

45:57.740 --> 45:59.580
 And for the longest time, I would wonder,

45:59.580 --> 46:00.540
 why am I doing this?

46:00.540 --> 46:03.340
 And I have a couple ideas about why.

46:03.340 --> 46:07.980
 One is that I was attempting to just avoid

46:07.980 --> 46:09.180
 thinking about other things.

46:09.180 --> 46:12.940
 It's just anger is such an attractive emotional force

46:12.940 --> 46:14.700
 and it's an attractant.

46:14.700 --> 46:15.340
 It's not attractive.

46:15.340 --> 46:15.980
 We don't like it.

46:15.980 --> 46:18.860
 And yet oftentimes anger is a great way

46:18.860 --> 46:20.780
 to replace feeling something else,

46:21.580 --> 46:24.220
 feeling sad or having to come up or to do work

46:24.220 --> 46:25.420
 or to do something useful.

46:26.620 --> 46:32.060
 So it has this kind of gravitational force to it.

46:32.060 --> 46:33.020
 That was one idea.

46:33.580 --> 46:36.940
 The other idea was in imagining kind of worst outcomes,

46:37.500 --> 46:39.260
 then actually that relationship

46:39.900 --> 46:41.980
 could actually seem a lot better in reality.

46:41.980 --> 46:44.060
 It's almost like creating this negative contrast.

46:44.060 --> 46:46.460
 It's like, oh, well then it's not that bad.

46:47.100 --> 46:50.460
 And then the third possibility is I have no idea why,

46:50.460 --> 46:51.820
 but it seemed like a reflex

46:51.820 --> 46:53.260
 and I spent some time thinking about it.

46:53.260 --> 46:55.180
 I can't say I've resolved it completely,

46:55.180 --> 46:58.940
 but why would somebody have a narrative

46:58.940 --> 47:01.980
 or a default narrative when driving or when walking of,

47:01.980 --> 47:03.580
 I'm just going to spend some time

47:03.580 --> 47:05.900
 and think about how terrible this thing is going to turn out

47:05.900 --> 47:07.740
 or how someone's going to upset me or harm me

47:07.740 --> 47:09.820
 or how terrible I am.

47:09.820 --> 47:13.260
 It seems, again, like maladaptive thinking,

47:13.260 --> 47:14.780
 maladaptive wiring,

47:14.780 --> 47:17.100
 and yet I have to assume that it serves some purpose.

47:17.900 --> 47:18.700
 Yeah, yeah.

47:19.260 --> 47:21.020
 I mean, I think there are three factors there

47:21.660 --> 47:23.100
 and they're all bad.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.740
 And I think you spoke to at least two of them, right?

47:25.740 --> 47:28.780
 They, I think, speak so powerfully

47:28.780 --> 47:31.500
 to how insidious trauma is

47:31.500 --> 47:35.420
 and how these are real brain changes inside of us.

47:35.420 --> 47:38.540
 So I would say the three factors, punishment,

47:38.540 --> 47:42.140
 punishment, avoidance, and control, right?

47:42.140 --> 47:46.300
 So the trauma inside of us that makes a guilt and shame

47:47.180 --> 47:50.140
 so often, so often,

47:50.140 --> 47:53.500
 leads to a desire to punish oneself, right?

47:53.500 --> 47:54.380
 And the idea that,

47:54.380 --> 47:56.220
 oh, that was my fault or I deserve that.

47:56.220 --> 47:58.780
 Well, what do we do if something is someone's fault

47:58.780 --> 48:01.100
 and someone now deserves punishment, right?

48:01.100 --> 48:02.700
 I mean, we punish them, right?

48:02.700 --> 48:03.500
 We send them to jail.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.860
 We give them a fine, right?

48:04.860 --> 48:05.660
 We punish them.

48:05.660 --> 48:08.620
 And so what we do is punish ourselves, right?

48:08.620 --> 48:10.380
 And if we tell ourselves we're a loser

48:10.380 --> 48:12.460
 or this awful thing is gonna happen, right?

48:12.460 --> 48:14.540
 Then part of what we're doing is saying to ourselves,

48:14.540 --> 48:16.060
 see, right, you deserve that.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.660
 You're not gonna have anything better, right?

48:17.660 --> 48:20.940
 It's a negative, it's a very negative way

48:20.940 --> 48:25.260
 that the brain tries to make us, in a sense, do better

48:25.260 --> 48:27.980
 by hurting us more for the things that we couldn't

48:27.980 --> 48:29.260
 and shouldn't have been able to,

48:29.260 --> 48:32.140
 weren't expected to control in the first place, right?

48:32.140 --> 48:33.980
 The second is distraction.

48:33.980 --> 48:36.780
 As you said, anger, that kind of fantasy

48:36.780 --> 48:41.580
 can distract us from affect, feeling, and emotion

48:41.580 --> 48:42.940
 that can be much more negative.

48:42.940 --> 48:45.100
 You know, anger, it can be more gratifying

48:46.060 --> 48:47.500
 certainly than guilt or shame,

48:47.500 --> 48:49.820
 although guilt and shame can serve a punishment purpose.

48:49.820 --> 48:53.020
 But if anger is directed also towards ourselves, right,

48:53.020 --> 48:54.540
 then it can serve punishment too.

48:54.540 --> 48:58.140
 So punishment, avoidance, and the sense of control

48:58.140 --> 49:01.340
 that if you think ahead to something awful

49:01.340 --> 49:03.660
 that you're imagining is going to happen,

49:03.660 --> 49:05.820
 well, maybe that will let you avoid it, right?

49:05.820 --> 49:08.220
 I mean, you can see the brain here,

49:08.220 --> 49:09.820
 in a sense, really confused.

49:09.820 --> 49:11.980
 I mean, part of the brain wants to punish,

49:11.980 --> 49:14.060
 part of the brain doesn't want to think about it at all,

49:14.060 --> 49:16.300
 and part of the brain wants to make it better.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.860
 And then how all of that resolves

49:18.860 --> 49:21.260
 if we're not aware that, hey, this is in the context

49:21.260 --> 49:24.380
 of our brains being deeply impacted by trauma,

49:24.380 --> 49:27.420
 so what's going on here is all maladaptive, right?

49:27.420 --> 49:29.900
 Because these negative fantasies of the future,

49:29.900 --> 49:32.780
 they may help us feel better about something in the present,

49:32.780 --> 49:35.580
 but they don't help us make anything better, right?

49:35.580 --> 49:37.740
 They don't help us make anything better.

49:37.740 --> 49:40.380
 So this is the kind of the sequelae.

49:40.380 --> 49:43.980
 This is where trauma and all this reflexive stuff

49:43.980 --> 49:47.180
 that happens after trauma ultimately lead us.

49:47.180 --> 49:48.940
 And you can see how we get lost,

49:48.940 --> 49:52.700
 how I've seen over and over again in my own life,

49:52.700 --> 49:55.980
 in the lives of other people, how, man,

49:55.980 --> 49:59.020
 we get stuck in those situations.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.620
 That's why I see people sometimes,

50:00.620 --> 50:03.900
 this has been going on for 30 years, 40 years, right?

50:03.900 --> 50:07.100
 And it's just been going on over and over and over again

50:07.100 --> 50:10.620
 because there's no natural end to any of this, right?

50:10.620 --> 50:13.260
 Unless we look at it in a different way,

50:13.260 --> 50:15.260
 that we have knowledge and information like,

50:15.260 --> 50:17.100
 whoa, this isn't the way it has to be.

50:17.100 --> 50:19.020
 Let me bring a novel perspective to this.

50:19.580 --> 50:20.860
 It doesn't change on its own.

50:21.900 --> 50:26.860
 I'm struck by your statement that these thoughts

50:26.860 --> 50:29.260
 or behaviors can make us feel better,

50:29.260 --> 50:31.180
 but they don't actually make anything better.

50:31.180 --> 50:36.460
 In that way, this mode of imagining terrible outcomes

50:36.460 --> 50:39.420
 starts to immediately seem like taking opioids.

50:40.380 --> 50:41.660
 You feel better in the moment,

50:41.660 --> 50:43.340
 but it doesn't actually make anything better

50:43.340 --> 50:45.020
 and it probably makes things worse.

50:46.060 --> 50:50.140
 And just this question of how much worse

50:50.140 --> 50:52.220
 and in what direction.

50:53.980 --> 50:57.420
 And so I just want to just pause on that concept

50:57.420 --> 51:00.540
 because I think that concept of makes us feel better,

51:00.540 --> 51:01.820
 but doesn't make anything better.

51:01.820 --> 51:05.900
 I think it answers an earlier question about

51:06.860 --> 51:10.140
 this what seems to be a totally maladaptive wiring diagram.

51:10.140 --> 51:11.260
 We need to confront the thing,

51:11.260 --> 51:13.420
 but we don't want to go into the repetition and compulsion.

51:13.420 --> 51:17.820
 So it's a knife edge there to navigate through trauma.

51:20.060 --> 51:23.100
 Working with a very skilled clinician like yourself,

51:23.100 --> 51:25.820
 I think is the ideal circumstance for people.

51:25.820 --> 51:29.740
 And of course there are people who can't access support

51:29.740 --> 51:31.500
 from somebody for whatever reason.

51:31.500 --> 51:36.860
 You've talked about journaling as a useful tool.

51:36.860 --> 51:39.660
 Could you, maybe you highlight some of the other things

51:39.660 --> 51:41.260
 that people can do on their own.

51:41.260 --> 51:43.500
 And then I'd also like to talk about

51:43.500 --> 51:46.220
 what makes for a good therapist.

51:46.220 --> 51:47.340
 What should people look for,

51:47.340 --> 51:49.020
 for those that are seeking therapy,

51:49.020 --> 51:50.300
 especially nowadays when a lot of therapy

51:50.300 --> 51:51.660
 is being done remotely.

51:51.660 --> 51:52.860
 But let's just start with the,

51:52.860 --> 51:58.380
 let's just call them self-generated or zero cost

51:59.580 --> 52:00.300
 sorts of things.

52:01.340 --> 52:02.460
 Journaling being the first,

52:02.460 --> 52:03.660
 and then what are some of the others?

52:03.660 --> 52:05.020
 And what kind of structure

52:05.020 --> 52:06.940
 would you recommend someone put around journaling?

52:07.580 --> 52:08.780
 Carry a journal around all day

52:08.780 --> 52:10.140
 and jot things down as they come up,

52:10.140 --> 52:11.420
 or sit down and spend an hour

52:11.420 --> 52:14.140
 writing in complete sentences, for instance.

52:14.140 --> 52:14.860
 Yeah.

52:14.860 --> 52:18.140
 If I could add something to what you had just said

52:18.140 --> 52:18.860
 before the question,

52:18.860 --> 52:22.620
 I thought that we have these short-term coping mechanisms

52:22.620 --> 52:23.660
 in us, right?

52:23.660 --> 52:25.260
 And in a way it makes sense, right?

52:25.260 --> 52:28.700
 If we find ourselves in just terrible situations,

52:29.420 --> 52:31.260
 then a short-term coping mechanism

52:31.260 --> 52:32.940
 can get us through them, right?

52:32.940 --> 52:34.540
 So our brains are built that way,

52:34.540 --> 52:37.020
 and that's part of survival too, right?

52:37.020 --> 52:38.860
 And whether now in the modern world,

52:38.860 --> 52:41.660
 whether it's food, it's drugs, it's sex,

52:41.660 --> 52:43.580
 it's alcohol, right?

52:43.580 --> 52:45.980
 Or it's negative thoughts, right?

52:45.980 --> 52:48.060
 This is short-term soothing.

52:48.700 --> 52:50.380
 Even the negative thoughts and anger

52:50.380 --> 52:54.140
 is short-term soothing at the expense of long-term change,

52:54.860 --> 52:55.340
 right?

52:55.340 --> 52:56.380
 And that's where, you know,

52:56.380 --> 52:59.100
 addictive pathways can come into play.

52:59.100 --> 53:00.300
 And that's where, again,

53:01.660 --> 53:04.780
 how we're built evolutionarily for survival

53:04.780 --> 53:06.460
 doesn't help us, you know,

53:06.460 --> 53:07.980
 in the way humans have evolved.

53:07.980 --> 53:10.300
 Like we haven't lived this way throughout, you know,

53:10.300 --> 53:13.740
 99.9 something percent of human history, right?

53:13.740 --> 53:16.060
 So we're not adapted to this.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.660
 So I want to just make a point of saying that

53:17.660 --> 53:19.660
 about the short-term soothing at the expense

53:19.660 --> 53:22.540
 of long-term change, you know?

53:22.540 --> 53:24.620
 And then the question you had asked about,

53:24.620 --> 53:26.060
 say, journaling or what can we do

53:26.060 --> 53:28.780
 that's outside of a professional,

53:28.780 --> 53:31.500
 I think the hallmark of it has to be

53:31.500 --> 53:33.660
 bringing new eyes to it, right?

53:33.660 --> 53:36.620
 Like thinking about self with a curiosity

53:36.620 --> 53:40.220
 instead of just a simple automaticity or repetition, right?

53:40.220 --> 53:42.540
 Like, why am I thinking about this?

53:42.540 --> 53:44.060
 When did this start?

53:44.060 --> 53:45.740
 Why is this in me, right?

53:45.740 --> 53:49.500
 It's that whether it's words or whether we're writing,

53:49.500 --> 53:50.620
 that's so important.

53:50.620 --> 53:53.980
 So I think for journaling, it depends on the person.

53:53.980 --> 53:55.500
 I mean, we don't want somebody carrying around

53:55.500 --> 53:57.900
 a journal all day if then there's a compulsion

53:57.900 --> 53:59.020
 to I need to write about everything

53:59.020 --> 54:00.220
 that's going on in my mind, right?

54:00.220 --> 54:01.500
 Like that might be good to,

54:01.500 --> 54:03.340
 okay, write a little bit at night, right?

54:03.340 --> 54:05.100
 Or someone who might think, you know,

54:05.100 --> 54:07.740
 sometimes this really comes into my mind in a strong way

54:07.740 --> 54:08.940
 and it could be unpredictable, right?

54:08.940 --> 54:10.860
 I want to have the journal with me.

54:10.860 --> 54:13.740
 So, ah, that thing is back in my mind now.

54:13.740 --> 54:16.380
 You know, let me write about it, right?

54:16.380 --> 54:18.060
 Because then putting words to it

54:18.060 --> 54:20.540
 and then being able to read those words, right?

54:20.540 --> 54:22.860
 And when people read, even do a little bit of journaling

54:22.860 --> 54:26.460
 and they read like, oh, I thought again

54:26.460 --> 54:29.660
 about how I'm a terrible person who can't have a good life

54:29.660 --> 54:32.780
 because I was in such a bad car accident

54:32.780 --> 54:34.460
 or because that person attacked me

54:34.460 --> 54:37.100
 or because when I was in school, I was bullied

54:37.100 --> 54:39.580
 because I look different than everyone else, right?

54:39.580 --> 54:41.500
 Or I acted different for everyone else.

54:41.500 --> 54:44.700
 Wow, you know, to actually see that written out,

54:44.700 --> 54:46.860
 it's, you know, it's a little bit of that,

54:48.140 --> 54:49.580
 it's a little bit of that,

54:49.580 --> 54:51.100
 like when you're saying it to someone

54:51.100 --> 54:52.700
 as if it were someone else, right?

54:52.700 --> 54:54.620
 Because now there's enough distance from it.

54:54.620 --> 54:56.620
 Like I'm looking at the words I wrote, right?

54:56.620 --> 54:57.820
 That we get some distance

54:57.820 --> 55:01.260
 and we can start to integrate some of the,

55:01.260 --> 55:02.700
 not just the compassion,

55:02.700 --> 55:05.180
 but integrating compassion and logic, right?

55:05.180 --> 55:07.020
 Of like, okay, I feel a sense of compassion.

55:07.020 --> 55:08.380
 Oh, wait, what does this mean?

55:08.380 --> 55:10.380
 What really happened here, right?

55:10.380 --> 55:13.260
 And gosh, I did start thinking differently after that.

55:13.260 --> 55:15.260
 I started, that's where this came from, right?

55:15.260 --> 55:16.940
 That's why I'm saying this.

55:16.940 --> 55:19.740
 It's those kinds of revelations that we can have

55:19.740 --> 55:22.460
 through, again, the written or spoken word.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.860
 And I think, again, that involves a trusted other

55:25.660 --> 55:27.340
 or writing, right?

55:27.340 --> 55:30.300
 And I think that those are ways we can do this

55:30.300 --> 55:33.500
 where we bring some de novo perspective

55:33.500 --> 55:36.700
 to something that often has been bouncing around inside of us.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.700
 And it's amazing to me that, you know,

55:38.700 --> 55:42.780
 I can see such intelligent and pathically attuned people

55:42.780 --> 55:46.860
 who've had the same thing running over and over again

55:46.860 --> 55:49.180
 in their mind for years.

55:49.180 --> 55:51.180
 And it just points out that our brains

55:51.180 --> 55:53.420
 don't automatically say, hey, wait a second.

55:53.420 --> 55:55.260
 You know, I've been spinning wheels here

55:55.260 --> 55:56.220
 for a long, long time.

55:56.220 --> 55:57.660
 Like, was there another way to look at this?

55:58.220 --> 56:00.140
 We need something from the outside,

56:00.140 --> 56:01.900
 which can just be knowledge, right?

56:01.900 --> 56:03.820
 Which is why I think what we're doing here

56:03.820 --> 56:06.620
 or the reason I wrote the book that I wrote

56:06.620 --> 56:11.420
 was like apprehending this like amazing surprise to me,

56:11.420 --> 56:14.460
 right, which is like, wow, like some huge percentage

56:14.460 --> 56:18.860
 of everything I'm treating is rooted in trauma

56:18.860 --> 56:21.100
 and the opacity of trauma, right?

56:21.100 --> 56:24.060
 Which is why we don't see that, oh, the depression,

56:24.060 --> 56:26.460
 the panic attacks, the life change, the addiction,

56:26.460 --> 56:28.780
 the, you know, the maladaptive choices,

56:28.780 --> 56:30.860
 like, oh, this is all coming from trauma

56:30.860 --> 56:34.140
 because it hides itself in that opacity.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.700
 So we need a de novo perspective

56:36.700 --> 56:38.140
 if we're doing it on our own.

56:38.140 --> 56:40.300
 And we need that if we're doing it in therapy,

56:40.300 --> 56:42.540
 which might link to like finding the right therapist,

56:42.540 --> 56:44.940
 right, which is also part of your question.

56:44.940 --> 56:47.980
 Yeah, I definitely want to know about how to assess

56:47.980 --> 56:49.180
 and find the right therapist.

56:49.180 --> 56:53.580
 Before we cover that, however, something came up

56:54.460 --> 56:56.140
 in the course of your answer.

56:56.940 --> 57:00.540
 I can immediately relate to this idea that, you know,

57:00.540 --> 57:02.860
 certain behaviors are really maladaptive

57:02.860 --> 57:07.100
 and our stuffing things down or avoiding the topic

57:07.740 --> 57:09.980
 is problematic and bringing a curiosity

57:09.980 --> 57:12.140
 and an introspection and almost a third personing

57:12.700 --> 57:16.620
 of the experience that we've had in order to try

57:16.620 --> 57:19.740
 and address it truly from a new perspective.

57:20.940 --> 57:24.460
 It occurred to me as we were discussing this, however,

57:24.460 --> 57:27.420
 that some people, and yes, maybe I'm talking a little bit

57:27.420 --> 57:31.260
 about my own experience, we have a sense of our own identity

57:31.260 --> 57:35.340
 and how people view us and our ability to be functional

57:35.340 --> 57:37.020
 in the world in ways that we like.

57:37.020 --> 57:40.060
 Effective at work or a good brother or a good mother

57:40.060 --> 57:43.100
 or father or human being in the world.

57:43.100 --> 57:44.460
 We have relationships.

57:44.460 --> 57:47.500
 And I think that one thing that I have heard

57:48.780 --> 57:51.580
 and maybe I've experienced is that sometimes

57:51.580 --> 57:54.540
 those maladaptive thoughts or behaviors,

57:54.540 --> 57:58.220
 the things that generate a kind of a repetition of anger

57:58.220 --> 58:02.220
 or of arousal or activation or sadness that we have

58:02.220 --> 58:04.700
 some internal process where we funnel that

58:04.700 --> 58:06.540
 into a functionality in the world.

58:06.540 --> 58:09.020
 So I'll give a more concrete example.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.580
 So in thinking about things that have upset me in the past

58:13.580 --> 58:16.700
 and in imagining bad outcomes in the future,

58:16.700 --> 58:18.780
 there's a certain internal state of arousal

58:18.780 --> 58:20.060
 that comes about.

58:20.060 --> 58:24.780
 And for many years, I was able to use that not to feel angry,

58:24.780 --> 58:27.100
 but rather to work an extra three hours a day

58:27.100 --> 58:32.380
 or to pack my schedule with work and social engagement

58:32.380 --> 58:35.100
 so I could show up in a way that I hopefully

58:35.100 --> 58:37.580
 was a very good brother to my sister, for instance.

58:37.580 --> 58:41.820
 So in a way, it was a transformation of something negative

58:41.820 --> 58:44.700
 inside of me into a functionality in the world

58:44.700 --> 58:47.260
 that was actually very rewarding and beneficial.

58:47.820 --> 58:51.340
 And yet in describing it, I can immediately see how

58:51.340 --> 58:53.820
 it would be wonderful if I could source from something else.

58:53.820 --> 58:57.260
 And yet I, you can imagine, and I can imagine

58:57.260 --> 59:00.380
 how one would be reluctant, maybe even terrified

59:00.380 --> 59:01.660
 of giving up that source.

59:01.660 --> 59:02.460
 It's a fuel.

59:03.340 --> 59:07.900
 And I think in knowing some of the traumas of other people

59:07.900 --> 59:10.300
 and their reluctance to work through those,

59:10.300 --> 59:14.300
 obviously I'm not a therapist, I sense this over and over again

59:14.300 --> 59:18.060
 that one's positive identity can often be linked

59:18.060 --> 59:20.140
 to something difficult in their past.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.700
 And so people are reluctant to give up this fuel.

59:22.700 --> 59:23.900
 Yes.

59:23.900 --> 59:26.700
 Because it's, in that sense, it's functional.

59:28.060 --> 59:32.140
 The only thing that allowed me to kind of start to address this

59:32.140 --> 59:34.060
 and why I'm still so curious about this,

59:34.060 --> 59:36.940
 because I don't think I've worked through this process completely,

59:37.820 --> 59:39.580
 again, a little more self-disclosure there,

59:39.580 --> 59:44.780
 is that I was told that these words,

59:44.780 --> 59:47.020
 just imagine how much better it would be

59:47.020 --> 59:50.860
 if you could source from a different fuel,

59:50.860 --> 59:52.300
 a fuel that felt better.

59:52.300 --> 59:55.100
 Maybe it was on this sentence.

59:55.100 --> 1:00:00.060
 It was maybe you could actually be much more effective.

1:00:00.060 --> 1:00:00.540
 Yes.

1:00:00.540 --> 1:00:03.020
 Maybe you could be 10 times the better brother.

1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:03.260
 Yes.

1:00:03.260 --> 1:00:08.220
 Maybe you could have 10 times more insider work capacity, et cetera.

1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:11.580
 So it's on that hint of a promise that I,

1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:14.540
 at least I was inspired to start looking into these things

1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:16.860
 and reading about trauma in your book and elsewhere

1:00:16.860 --> 1:00:18.140
 and start to think about this.

1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:21.100
 So again, I realize this is a long-winded question

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:22.460
 and a somewhat complex idea,

1:00:22.460 --> 1:00:25.500
 but I think, or I hope that people will be able to resonate with this idea

1:00:25.500 --> 1:00:29.980
 that sometimes we want to stay attached to this short-term soothing,

1:00:29.980 --> 1:00:31.820
 that the punishment, distraction, or control

1:00:31.820 --> 1:00:35.740
 because it evokes this arousal and then we can apply that arousal.

1:00:35.740 --> 1:00:35.980
 Yes.

1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:39.820
 I think what you're describing maps, I think clinically,

1:00:39.820 --> 1:00:41.660
 to what gets called sublimation.

1:00:41.660 --> 1:00:44.460
 So there's something negative inside of us,

1:00:44.460 --> 1:00:46.380
 but we sort of transfer that energy,

1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:50.620
 we transfer that into something that is adaptive or that is positive.

1:00:50.620 --> 1:00:51.900
 So the idea of anger, right?

1:00:51.900 --> 1:00:54.220
 When I think of that thing and it makes anger in me,

1:00:54.220 --> 1:00:56.300
 I channel that into harder work, right?

1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:57.500
 Or I channel that into like,

1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:00.300
 I'm going to go be nicer to my brother, something like that.

1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:03.100
 And there's validity to that, right?

1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:06.460
 But it can become like self-justifying.

1:01:06.460 --> 1:01:07.580
 If a person thinks,

1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:09.900
 well, look at what this is doing for me, right?

1:01:09.900 --> 1:01:12.060
 I wouldn't work as hard without it, right?

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:15.180
 Now we start to become attached to the trauma.

1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:18.940
 Whereas I think what you had said is absolutely true

1:01:18.940 --> 1:01:24.140
 that just because we can sublimate some of the negative affect,

1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:27.820
 feeling, emotion that comes from trauma into something productive

1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:30.620
 doesn't mean that that's best, right?

1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:32.860
 I mean, you know, we can get to our destination

1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:34.940
 by taking a very circuitous route, right?

1:01:34.940 --> 1:01:37.580
 We might waste an hour getting there, but we get there.

1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:40.220
 That doesn't mean that that's best.

1:01:40.220 --> 1:01:42.220
 And it also doesn't look at all the negative, right?

1:01:42.220 --> 1:01:45.100
 In this example, the wasted fuel, the wasted time, right?

1:01:45.100 --> 1:01:48.700
 We get somewhere, but we are not optimizing.

1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:53.740
 And I have yet to see one person who has addressed the trauma

1:01:53.740 --> 1:01:56.060
 and become less functional, right?

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:58.940
 It's always either they're just as functional,

1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:00.620
 but they're happier, right?

1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.940
 Or more functional because, as you said,

1:02:02.940 --> 1:02:05.660
 like just because we may be able to sublimate,

1:02:05.660 --> 1:02:08.940
 well, maybe what's going on will be 10 times better, right?

1:02:08.940 --> 1:02:12.860
 If we weren't sublimating because the sublimation limits us, right?

1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:16.380
 It limits our perspective to only what we can see and do

1:02:16.380 --> 1:02:18.220
 through the lens of the trauma.

1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:22.140
 And that is never better than the alternative.

1:02:23.180 --> 1:02:23.900
 Thank you for that.

1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:24.780
 Yeah, you're welcome.

1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:25.280
 Yeah.

1:02:26.460 --> 1:02:30.220
 Let's discuss how one could or should go about

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:32.300
 finding a really good therapist.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:38.940
 Typically, in my experience, this is done by word of mouth.

1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:39.820
 You know, there's this person.

1:02:39.820 --> 1:02:40.780
 You might want to work with them.

1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:41.580
 They're really great.

1:02:41.580 --> 1:02:43.020
 But what are some of the characteristics

1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:44.700
 that one should look for?

1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:48.300
 And should we take into account whether or not

1:02:48.300 --> 1:02:51.820
 we are a person who, you know, for instance,

1:02:51.820 --> 1:02:53.900
 I've heard this from listeners,

1:02:53.900 --> 1:02:56.940
 although I'm definitely not talking about myself here

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.780
 in cloaking something.

1:02:59.420 --> 1:03:00.540
 Some people will say, you know,

1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:02.460
 I want to work with a somatic therapist

1:03:02.460 --> 1:03:04.460
 because I've actually heard someone say,

1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:06.060
 I think in feels.

1:03:06.060 --> 1:03:07.500
 You know, I feel stuff in my body,

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.980
 so I want to work with someone who can really acknowledge that.

1:03:09.980 --> 1:03:11.820
 Or someone else will say, you know,

1:03:11.820 --> 1:03:15.660
 I want to work with somebody who has this orientation or that orientation

1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:19.260
 or is open to my particular lifestyle

1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:21.980
 or isn't going to tell me that I have to leave my relationship.

1:03:21.980 --> 1:03:23.820
 You know, I feel like people already show up

1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:25.660
 to the question of who to work with,

1:03:25.660 --> 1:03:27.900
 with all these, you know, things internally,

1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:30.380
 some of which are voiced and some of which aren't.

1:03:30.380 --> 1:03:31.900
 So I'd love for you to talk about maybe

1:03:31.900 --> 1:03:36.060
 some of the core features of a really good therapist

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:38.380
 and then how to look for a therapist

1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:40.220
 and also how to think about oneself

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:41.500
 in looking for a therapist.

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.660
 Because of these kind of predispositions.

1:03:43.660 --> 1:03:44.300
 Right, right.

1:03:44.860 --> 1:03:49.180
 Well, there's a lot of data about this over the years

1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:53.020
 that if you look at what are the top 10 important factors

1:03:53.020 --> 1:03:58.060
 to find in a therapist, just repeat rapport 10 times, right?

1:03:58.060 --> 1:03:59.420
 I mean, that's the key.

1:03:59.420 --> 1:04:01.980
 And if you think about that, it's pretty amazing, right?

1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:05.420
 Because therapeutic modalities can be so different, right?

1:04:05.420 --> 1:04:08.860
 And I think what that's telling us is,

1:04:08.860 --> 1:04:10.460
 in a way, something very obvious, right?

1:04:10.460 --> 1:04:11.820
 Like, what does rapport mean?

1:04:11.820 --> 1:04:13.820
 Like, you know, somebody's paying attention, right?

1:04:13.820 --> 1:04:14.540
 It's trust.

1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:15.580
 It's a back and forth.

1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:18.780
 It's like, yeah, even I'm doing something difficult.

1:04:18.780 --> 1:04:20.460
 I'm doing it with someone who's really helping me,

1:04:20.460 --> 1:04:21.900
 someone who's in it with me, right?

1:04:21.900 --> 1:04:23.420
 Someone who's really paying attention,

1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:24.460
 wants me to be better.

1:04:25.100 --> 1:04:26.380
 That's indispensable.

1:04:26.380 --> 1:04:27.820
 I mean, it's just indispensable.

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:28.780
 And I write in the book,

1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:31.020
 is someone, a therapist is not making eye contact

1:04:31.020 --> 1:04:32.540
 or this is the way they do it, right?

1:04:32.540 --> 1:04:34.220
 And you know, you gotta fit into the box

1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:35.420
 of the way they do it.

1:04:35.420 --> 1:04:37.180
 That is not going to be helpful.

1:04:37.180 --> 1:04:42.300
 And then what I think about that is the different modalities.

1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:43.900
 It doesn't actually tell us that,

1:04:43.900 --> 1:04:45.420
 oh, the modality is irrelevant.

1:04:45.420 --> 1:04:47.100
 I think that's not true.

1:04:47.100 --> 1:04:50.860
 I think that good therapists are not pigeonholed

1:04:50.860 --> 1:04:52.300
 by a certain modality.

1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:56.300
 They may come at the world largely through a psychodynamic

1:04:56.300 --> 1:04:58.460
 or a CBT or a DBT lens.

1:04:58.460 --> 1:05:01.740
 There's lots of different ways to do therapy.

1:05:01.740 --> 1:05:03.580
 But when you really talk to those people,

1:05:03.580 --> 1:05:05.820
 really good, experienced therapists,

1:05:05.820 --> 1:05:09.420
 it's all coming through the vehicle of the rapport,

1:05:09.420 --> 1:05:13.020
 but they're practically shifting to what the person needs.

1:05:13.020 --> 1:05:15.260
 You know, I don't understand the idea that like,

1:05:15.260 --> 1:05:17.420
 oh, I just do this, right?

1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:18.220
 I don't do that.

1:05:18.220 --> 1:05:20.220
 And when people are pigeonholed that way,

1:05:20.220 --> 1:05:23.020
 I don't think they help their patients very well, right?

1:05:23.020 --> 1:05:25.100
 We have to be diverse enough to say,

1:05:25.100 --> 1:05:27.580
 hey, I want all the arrows in the quiver, right?

1:05:27.580 --> 1:05:29.820
 And even though there might be one that I favor

1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:31.900
 and that's the lens I see things through,

1:05:31.900 --> 1:05:33.260
 no, I can be versatile.

1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:33.980
 I can shift.

1:05:33.980 --> 1:05:36.620
 I can adapt to what this person needs.

1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:41.500
 And I think if you have that, you've got a winning combination.

1:05:42.140 --> 1:05:42.380
 Great.

1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:44.700
 So people should perhaps try a few therapists

1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:46.780
 and maybe have a session or two or three

1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:49.820
 to see if the rapport feels like it's taking root.

1:05:49.820 --> 1:05:51.100
 Do you have that right?

1:05:51.100 --> 1:05:51.260
 Yeah.

1:05:51.260 --> 1:05:53.260
 And I think that's why word of mouth is important, right?

1:05:53.260 --> 1:05:56.140
 If someone you trust tells you, hey, this is a good person,

1:05:56.140 --> 1:05:57.260
 that says a lot, right?

1:05:57.260 --> 1:06:00.380
 It already makes the pretest probability quite high.

1:06:00.380 --> 1:06:05.340
 But yes, it's interesting to see when people have a therapist

1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:07.660
 or they call their insurance and they're assigned a therapist,

1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:10.460
 this thought that like, oh, that's the person I have to have now.

1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:13.180
 And it's like, no, you should look at that like anyone.

1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:16.540
 You know, you would be interviewing, right, for a job, right?

1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:22.220
 But you got to bring again the right set of thoughts to that to be helped, right?

1:06:22.220 --> 1:06:24.780
 Which is like, I want someone who has rapport with me.

1:06:24.780 --> 1:06:27.180
 I don't want someone who's going to make it easy, right?

1:06:27.180 --> 1:06:28.940
 Who's like, well, gosh, it's kind of pleasant

1:06:28.940 --> 1:06:31.740
 because then that means they're not talking about the difficult things, right?

1:06:31.740 --> 1:06:34.140
 So if one brings like, I know this isn't going to be easy.

1:06:34.140 --> 1:06:36.220
 I got to talk about difficult things, right?

1:06:36.220 --> 1:06:39.660
 Even if one doesn't recognize, oh, I got to talk about the trauma in me, right?

1:06:39.660 --> 1:06:44.060
 But to go to therapy thinking, no, it's, I mean, sometimes it's enjoyable,

1:06:44.060 --> 1:06:46.140
 but a lot of times, right, it's not, right?

1:06:46.140 --> 1:06:46.860
 It's hard work.

1:06:46.860 --> 1:06:47.820
 It can be excruciating.

1:06:47.820 --> 1:06:49.180
 We can cry doing it.

1:06:49.180 --> 1:06:51.420
 But to say, right, that that's how I'm going to be helped.

1:06:51.420 --> 1:06:54.780
 And I want someone who's going to do that with me, you know,

1:06:54.780 --> 1:06:57.660
 who's really looking at what's going on inside of me.

1:06:57.660 --> 1:06:59.260
 How do we help me?

1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:02.220
 And I can feel sort of the robustness of that.

1:07:02.220 --> 1:07:06.140
 If one brings that approach and then looks at the therapist through that lens,

1:07:06.140 --> 1:07:10.860
 you're very likely to then move on from someone who's not a good choice, right?

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:12.780
 And really stick with someone who is,

1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:16.300
 even though that doesn't mean it's always like pleasant and enjoyable.

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:18.380
 I mean, it has to not be that sometimes.

1:07:19.420 --> 1:07:19.920
 Right.

1:07:20.860 --> 1:07:23.660
 Maybe we could drill a little deeper into the mechanics of therapy.

1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:28.540
 I put out a few questions to audience asking what they want to know about therapy.

1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:29.900
 And it was amazing.

1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:32.700
 I got hundreds, if not thousands of responses saying,

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:34.940
 how should I show up to therapy?

1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:39.100
 So for instance, should people take a five-minute meditative drop-in before

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:41.980
 or should they just show up cold and let it emerge?

1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:47.660
 During therapy, is it a good idea to take notes or to not take notes?

1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:53.660
 And then post-therapy, how should clients, patients, as they're sometimes called,

1:07:53.660 --> 1:07:57.580
 one or the other, I never know which, how should they process that information?

1:07:57.580 --> 1:08:01.740
 Should they take some designated time afterwards and in an ideal world,

1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:05.020
 take a 30-minute walk afterwards and think about the material

1:08:05.020 --> 1:08:06.860
 or should they set it aside and come back to it?

1:08:06.860 --> 1:08:10.380
 Of course, there are constraints, work and family, et cetera.

1:08:10.380 --> 1:08:14.940
 But there's a lot of knowledge out there about how to best show up to a workout,

1:08:14.940 --> 1:08:18.380
 warm up for five, 10 minutes, then do this, et cetera, and then the cool down.

1:08:18.380 --> 1:08:23.100
 I mean, here we're talking about hard psychological work aimed at bettering oneself.

1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:28.220
 So to my knowledge, I've not ever seen this information anywhere.

1:08:28.220 --> 1:08:30.700
 It'd be very useful to hear your thoughts on this.

1:08:30.700 --> 1:08:31.200
 Yeah.

1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:36.540
 Well, I'm not trying to duck the question, but I think it varies so much by person.

1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:38.380
 So if you think about the first part of your question,

1:08:38.380 --> 1:08:40.860
 I think was how to show up to therapy, right?

1:08:40.860 --> 1:08:45.740
 And I think the answer would be whatever lets you be fully present when you're in therapy.

1:08:45.740 --> 1:08:50.220
 Now, for some people, there's going to be, I show up early, you know, I sit, I calm myself,

1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:53.340
 I meditate a little bit, I mean, that's how then they're present, right?

1:08:53.340 --> 1:08:56.300
 For other people, you know, they just show up, walk into the room,

1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:58.140
 they can stop another present, right?

1:08:58.140 --> 1:09:01.900
 Because whatever works for that person so that they're really there,

1:09:01.900 --> 1:09:05.340
 their thoughts, their energy is really in what's going on.

1:09:05.340 --> 1:09:07.420
 And the same thing applies on the other end.

1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:11.580
 You know, there are people who are really well served by, you know,

1:09:11.580 --> 1:09:14.540
 going for a walk if they can or sitting quietly after therapy,

1:09:14.540 --> 1:09:16.060
 kind of putting that in order, right?

1:09:16.060 --> 1:09:17.660
 Otherwise they lose some of it, right?

1:09:17.660 --> 1:09:19.900
 Or like some of the ahas, right?

1:09:19.900 --> 1:09:23.180
 Or the, oh, that's an interesting thought that they really need to put it in order.

1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:26.460
 Maybe that involves taking some notes during therapy, right?

1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:28.780
 For other people, they need to do the exact opposite.

1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:31.900
 They need to like leave, not think about that at all,

1:09:31.900 --> 1:09:34.380
 and then they can reflect on it later and learn from it.

1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:36.380
 So, you know, we're so different here.

1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:42.060
 Human beings, there's such a diversity in us that I think there's no hard answer to that.

1:09:42.060 --> 1:09:45.100
 But it's like being present when it's happening,

1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:52.140
 then being able to sort of consolidate and retain what's been gained is most important.

1:09:52.140 --> 1:09:54.860
 And I think we have to figure that out person by person.

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:58.460
 I mean, I try and do that in the work of like, what's serving this person best?

1:09:58.460 --> 1:10:01.820
 And sometimes we, you know, sometimes it evolves and sometimes we talk about it,

1:10:01.820 --> 1:10:03.500
 but it varies so much.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:09.020
 If someone were thinking about embarking on therapy or more therapy to address trauma

1:10:09.020 --> 1:10:13.340
 or just general issues of life, what is the frequency that you recommend?

1:10:13.340 --> 1:10:15.340
 I could imagine two extreme models.

1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:18.460
 One is, okay, I'm going to finally tackle this trauma.

1:10:18.460 --> 1:10:23.260
 I'm going to do therapy three times a week, but for a shorter period of time, you know,

1:10:23.260 --> 1:10:29.420
 six months, you know, over and out versus this open-ended model of once a week,

1:10:29.420 --> 1:10:33.740
 typically for as long as it takes.

1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:34.940
 Right, right.

1:10:35.660 --> 1:10:37.660
 I think that also varies.

1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:43.100
 And I work with people in varied ways from someone who's doing well and like,

1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:45.580
 we meet for a half hour every six months, right?

1:10:45.580 --> 1:10:53.100
 To doing week-long hourly sessions, to spending three intense days with someone in a row, right?

1:10:53.100 --> 1:11:00.940
 So I think as far as like kind of guiding principles, what I have found in my own life,

1:11:00.940 --> 1:11:08.780
 because I value my own therapy tremendously, so I found in my own life and in my own clinical work

1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:14.460
 that if it's less than once a week, then it's hard for us to retain really.

1:11:14.460 --> 1:11:17.420
 You know, we spend a lot of time kind of catching up.

1:11:17.420 --> 1:11:18.220
 Okay, what's happened?

1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:20.780
 Let's get back to the place we were at before, right?

1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:23.100
 Which is why I think if we're really going to get somewhere,

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:25.260
 we're not just trying to maintain something, right?

1:11:25.260 --> 1:11:29.100
 Then I think once a week for an hour is really kind of the minimum, right?

1:11:30.220 --> 1:11:36.060
 But more intensive work, it's like the more intense it is, it's not linear, right?

1:11:36.060 --> 1:11:37.340
 It's an exponential gain.

1:11:37.340 --> 1:11:40.380
 Like we do a lot of intensive work, right?

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:46.380
 Where someone will come and do 30 clinical hours with us over the course of a week.

1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:51.500
 So five or six different clinicians, 30 clinical hours, and you know,

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:54.940
 we found that the benefits of doing that are immense.

1:11:54.940 --> 1:11:58.220
 It's like a year's worth of therapy consolidated.

1:11:58.220 --> 1:12:01.660
 And you take, well, 30 hours, let's say, you know, we go almost every week,

1:12:01.660 --> 1:12:06.460
 maybe that's 45 or 50 hours, but 30 hours with that kind of intensity

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.860
 is worth probably 60 hours, you know, done in a different way.

1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:14.860
 Because then it's in us in an active way, right?

1:12:14.860 --> 1:12:18.700
 It's in the therapist in an active way, becomes very, very dynamic.

1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:21.820
 So I think turning up the intensity if there's something

1:12:21.820 --> 1:12:24.620
 that we really need to process absolutely makes sense.

1:12:24.620 --> 1:12:26.860
 And I do that in my own life is something now it's like, whoa,

1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:31.500
 something is really distressing me and it's linking into prior trauma.

1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:33.100
 And I can see what's going on in me.

1:12:33.100 --> 1:12:35.980
 Now I start to have ruminative thoughts, you know, with negativity.

1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:38.060
 Like I got to go more, right?

1:12:38.060 --> 1:12:41.820
 Because I got to do that processing so I can get to the place that I am,

1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:45.180
 which is not that it's not that the trauma has no impact on me, right?

1:12:45.180 --> 1:12:48.860
 It's that the impact is much less than it was before the therapy.

1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:53.980
 And that I most often, more often than not, have an ability to see

1:12:54.540 --> 1:12:57.340
 when it's now intruding into my thoughts.

1:12:57.340 --> 1:13:00.460
 And it's taking me away from like what I really think and believe

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:04.300
 or being able to draw logic and emotion together and make good decisions.

1:13:04.300 --> 1:13:07.500
 Turning up the intensity then absolutely makes sense.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:13.100
 With this very deep intensive work of 30 hours in a week,

1:13:13.100 --> 1:13:17.260
 what brings somebody to the type of work of that sort?

1:13:17.980 --> 1:13:22.060
 Is it a suicide risk or a severe addiction situation?

1:13:22.060 --> 1:13:26.780
 I mean, how does one gauge how much therapy they ought to be doing?

1:13:27.420 --> 1:13:31.820
 And should it always be on the therapist to decide that frequency?

1:13:31.820 --> 1:13:38.620
 What would bring someone to a situation of five therapists and 30 hours a week in one week?

1:13:38.620 --> 1:13:39.820
 Right, right.

1:13:39.820 --> 1:13:44.780
 It's usually a person who is really distressed by something.

1:13:44.780 --> 1:13:49.580
 You know, whether that's it's so negatively impacting their life or life.

1:13:49.580 --> 1:13:51.740
 Or sometimes a person comes to a realization.

1:13:51.740 --> 1:13:53.100
 I just can't take this anymore, right?

1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:54.940
 I'm sick of this cyclical depression.

1:13:54.940 --> 1:13:56.380
 I got to stop having panic attacks.

1:13:56.380 --> 1:13:58.220
 Like I need help, right?

1:13:58.220 --> 1:14:04.460
 I need help, right, but it's usually some, you know, crisis point with the idea of crisis

1:14:04.460 --> 1:14:08.780
 and the meaning of, okay, something comes to a head and after it things are going to be different,

1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:09.020
 right?

1:14:09.020 --> 1:14:11.580
 Not a crisis and things are going to be negative afterwards,

1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:16.140
 but a point where then that cognitive flexibility comes to the fore of like,

1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:18.220
 wait, I need to do something different, right?

1:14:18.220 --> 1:14:23.020
 So that's often what brings us, you know, sometimes it's other people pointing it out

1:14:23.020 --> 1:14:26.220
 or somebody's had an intervention somewhere or yes,

1:14:26.220 --> 1:14:32.140
 that person has been hospitalized after a suicide attempt or they've gone back to rehab again

1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:35.020
 for the third or fourth time and their life is really in danger.

1:14:35.020 --> 1:14:37.580
 Sometimes it's that and sometimes it's a person realizing,

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:41.900
 yeah, I just want to look at myself and understand myself better.

1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:45.980
 You know, I know that what's going on in me isn't as good as it can be, right?

1:14:45.980 --> 1:14:49.500
 So I think people can come to it for all sorts of different ways.

1:14:50.460 --> 1:14:53.740
 And I think, yes, I think a lot of times it would be the therapist to say,

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:58.140
 it looks more work, you know, more intensive work or can make a difference.

1:14:58.140 --> 1:15:02.860
 But I think the person also needs to, you know, take ownership of their own therapy

1:15:02.860 --> 1:15:06.460
 and say, if I don't feel helped enough, well, I have to think about that, right?

1:15:06.460 --> 1:15:10.780
 And talk to the therapist about that because maybe that therapist isn't a match, right?

1:15:10.780 --> 1:15:15.500
 Or maybe you talk to the therapist and the therapist can change his or her approach, right?

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:19.100
 Or maybe you talk to the therapist and increase the frequency, right?

1:15:19.100 --> 1:15:22.220
 But the idea is to be aware of it, right?

1:15:22.220 --> 1:15:25.740
 And if one's needs aren't being met, to acknowledge that, right?

1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:30.620
 Because people can get into a rhythm of therapy where it's really not helping them, right?

1:15:30.620 --> 1:15:33.020
 But they either feel sort of nihilistic about it,

1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:35.500
 like, oh, I'm no better and I'm going to therapy, right?

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:38.540
 Or sometimes there's a sense that, well, I'm in therapy,

1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:41.340
 so I'm kind of checking that box of doing something for myself,

1:15:41.340 --> 1:15:43.180
 but it's not really getting me anywhere.

1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:47.100
 And then the part of the brain that's controlled by the guilt and shame and avoidance

1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:48.860
 thinks that's a great idea, right?

1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:52.300
 So again, this ability to observe ourselves and like, what's going on?

1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:55.500
 Am I being helped in the way, do I feel helped, right?

1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:59.340
 Am I in some ways even like happy that I'm not feeling helped

1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:01.980
 because I don't have to face this thing I don't want to face, right?

1:16:01.980 --> 1:16:04.620
 Or am I too afraid to say I need more help, right?

1:16:04.620 --> 1:16:06.620
 Do we really need to look at ourselves?

1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:09.420
 And this is where the insurance systems often are very difficult

1:16:09.420 --> 1:16:11.420
 because it's hard sometimes for a person to say,

1:16:11.420 --> 1:16:14.220
 oh, I need more therapy because that may not be possible, right?

1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:18.540
 So there are sort of negative factors in the world around us,

1:16:18.540 --> 1:16:22.940
 but ultimately I think the answer to the question comes down to observing ourselves

1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:26.700
 and taking ownership of like what's going on in us and how we're feeling

1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:32.140
 and then feeling that commitment to self or to self-care to say,

1:16:32.140 --> 1:16:33.580
 I need to go change this.

1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:37.100
 And for those that maybe don't have the means or insurance or access

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:41.900
 to do even one day a week therapy in the journaling model,

1:16:41.900 --> 1:16:47.420
 could one perhaps take an entire day, as awful as it might seem,

1:16:47.420 --> 1:16:50.220
 to do a lot of journaling and thinking and walking,

1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:53.100
 you know, do a self-generated intensive.

1:16:53.100 --> 1:16:55.180
 Do you think there's utility to that?

1:16:55.180 --> 1:16:58.540
 I mean, there could be, but again, it depends by person

1:16:58.540 --> 1:17:00.860
 because there could also be something negative about that.

1:17:00.860 --> 1:17:04.780
 If it's, you know, someone who's not at the point, not ready for that, right?

1:17:04.780 --> 1:17:09.260
 I mean, we don't come at, you know, we don't come directly at the trauma immediately.

1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:12.220
 At least most of the time we don't do that, right?

1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:15.500
 And we often don't explore it in depth.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:19.180
 Like this idea that, oh, that person now has to go through every second of the trauma

1:17:19.180 --> 1:17:20.380
 is actually not true.

1:17:20.380 --> 1:17:25.340
 I mean, sometimes it is, but that's not the common situation, right?

1:17:25.340 --> 1:17:28.940
 It's more often that person has to acknowledge like the example of like,

1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:32.780
 I was sexually abused and if they acknowledge that into and say,

1:17:32.780 --> 1:17:35.260
 okay, like, gosh, what has that done to me?

1:17:35.260 --> 1:17:37.900
 That doesn't mean, well, let's parse out every moment of like,

1:17:37.900 --> 1:17:40.460
 how that was and the terror of that, right?

1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:43.020
 So that can lead people to a worse place, right?

1:17:43.020 --> 1:17:48.940
 So I think the idea of biting off small pieces, so to speak,

1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:51.980
 where a person is writing, right, or is talking,

1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:56.220
 but I think if one is writing, it is good to communicate with another, right?

1:17:56.220 --> 1:17:58.060
 Another trusted person.

1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:01.500
 And if there's not someone in one's personal life, you know, they're clergy members.

1:18:01.500 --> 1:18:04.860
 Even if one isn't affiliated with an organized religion,

1:18:04.860 --> 1:18:08.460
 you could probably go places and get a clergy to want to help you, right?

1:18:08.460 --> 1:18:10.940
 I mean, there are people out there who want to help other people.

1:18:10.940 --> 1:18:13.260
 So they say, what if someone has no one?

1:18:13.260 --> 1:18:16.060
 I mean, almost never do we have no one here, right?

1:18:16.060 --> 1:18:17.740
 Because we could probably go find someone,

1:18:17.740 --> 1:18:20.860
 but we need to take that in pieces.

1:18:20.860 --> 1:18:26.060
 So there's some risk to trying to do the intensive thing, you know, on one's own.

1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:29.900
 And that's where I would put it in, if a person's having suicidal thoughts

1:18:29.900 --> 1:18:32.540
 or even thoughts of death, of not wanting to be alive,

1:18:32.540 --> 1:18:33.740
 I don't deserve to be alive.

1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:36.460
 I mean, these are warning signs for really getting help.

1:18:36.460 --> 1:18:39.820
 So there are some signs that say, hey, don't try and do that on your own, right?

1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:41.340
 Go try and find a resource.

1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:45.180
 And it's, you know, things that get to that level of severity of,

1:18:45.180 --> 1:18:46.460
 and often a person knows that.

1:18:46.460 --> 1:18:49.340
 I mean, am I in a place where I know I'm not healthy

1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:51.980
 and I'm having, you know, kind of scary thoughts?

1:18:51.980 --> 1:18:56.060
 Then we need, that's a person who really shouldn't be doing that on their own.

1:18:56.060 --> 1:18:57.260
 Great. Thank you for that.

1:18:57.260 --> 1:18:58.300
 You're welcome.

1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:00.460
 So we've been talking a lot about talking.

1:19:00.460 --> 1:19:06.700
 And now I'd like to talk a little bit about chemistry, drugs.

1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:11.020
 So maybe first we could talk prescription drugs.

1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:13.660
 I mean, you're a psychiatrist, so you're approved to

1:19:13.660 --> 1:19:17.660
 and presumably do prescribed medication where appropriate.

1:19:17.660 --> 1:19:20.220
 And this is a vast landscape, of course.

1:19:20.220 --> 1:19:22.460
 We've got ADHD.

1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:25.180
 And I should just tell you, I get more questions about ADHD

1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:28.860
 and the drugs related to ADHD and dopamine than any other topic.

1:19:28.860 --> 1:19:29.360
 Mm-hmm.

1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:31.180
 Any other topic.

1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:37.180
 So there's ADHD, there's OCD, there's depression, there's antidepressants and so forth.

1:19:38.540 --> 1:19:42.620
 Is there some way that we can, you know, wrap our arms around all of that

1:19:42.620 --> 1:19:46.620
 as a way of wading into this drug question?

1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:51.180
 And just address, you know, how does one decide when medication is useful?

1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:56.700
 Because in the end, the dissection tool that the psychiatrist or therapist has is language.

1:19:56.700 --> 1:20:00.620
 And at some point, one has to make an assessment about dopamine or serotonin

1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:02.060
 or whether or not a given drug would help.

1:20:02.620 --> 1:20:09.100
 And most therapies, I believe, don't involve putting someone in a brain scanner.

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.540
 And to my knowledge, there still is not a very good blood test to assess,

1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:14.540
 oh, is this person's dopamine low or high?

1:20:14.540 --> 1:20:15.820
 Correct me if I'm wrong.

1:20:15.820 --> 1:20:19.020
 And ultimately that, and I know there are companies out there,

1:20:19.020 --> 1:20:20.540
 so I'm not trying to undermine those companies.

1:20:20.540 --> 1:20:21.980
 But if I happen to do that in this statement,

1:20:21.980 --> 1:20:25.740
 if you take a blood test and find that your serotonin metabolites are low,

1:20:25.740 --> 1:20:29.660
 my understanding is it's possible that you are too low in serotonin in the brain,

1:20:29.660 --> 1:20:32.780
 but that's a very indirect window into what's really going on.

1:20:32.780 --> 1:20:40.700
 So how do you think about prescription drugs in the context of treating trauma

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:42.540
 and other conditions?

1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:45.500
 And then maybe we'll drill into some of the more specific conditions.

1:20:45.500 --> 1:20:46.220
 Sure.

1:20:46.220 --> 1:20:49.900
 I mean, I would first comment that there aren't tests for these things.

1:20:49.900 --> 1:20:53.340
 And I think the tests for metabolites, I mean, things are so different.

1:20:53.340 --> 1:20:57.820
 You know, by the time what we're talking about has been metabolized,

1:20:57.820 --> 1:21:00.940
 you know, often to some very significant extent left the brain.

1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:04.220
 Now it's in the peripheral blood that we really don't learn from that.

1:21:04.220 --> 1:21:10.060
 And I think that we tend to overutilize medicines in this country

1:21:10.060 --> 1:21:15.340
 because we have a healthcare system that often that's so based on throughput

1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:18.220
 that we want to polish the hood when there's a problem in the engine, right?

1:21:18.220 --> 1:21:21.900
 So we overutilize medicines often as an end point, right?

1:21:21.900 --> 1:21:24.780
 Oh, we're going to make that person's depression better with an antidepressant.

1:21:25.340 --> 1:21:27.180
 Well, I mean, maybe, right?

1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:32.300
 But most of the time, for that person's depression to really get better and stay better,

1:21:32.300 --> 1:21:35.740
 they need to unravel what's driving the depression, right?

1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:39.740
 So the first step is, I think there are two steps to it, right?

1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:47.180
 The first assessment step is, is there a diagnosis that the vast majority of the time,

1:21:47.180 --> 1:21:50.460
 if not sometimes all the time, really warrants a medicine?

1:21:50.460 --> 1:21:54.940
 So the bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right?

1:21:54.940 --> 1:22:00.540
 These are diagnoses that we understand more about them and what's going on in the brain

1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:03.740
 and how medicines can treat or stabilize them,

1:22:03.740 --> 1:22:07.900
 which doesn't mean the medicine is necessarily, it's not a substitute for therapy, right?

1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:11.100
 But sometimes the medicine and therapy can go hand in hand.

1:22:11.100 --> 1:22:16.220
 So for OCD, for example, warrants therapy, but it almost, not always,

1:22:16.220 --> 1:22:20.620
 but it almost always warrants medicine, too, so that you can ease the systems

1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:23.820
 that are making the rigidity and the repetition in the brain.

1:22:23.820 --> 1:22:27.980
 So the first kind of branch point can be, what is the diagnosis?

1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:29.980
 What is the level of severity, right?

1:22:29.980 --> 1:22:32.060
 And I think that's very, very important.

1:22:32.860 --> 1:22:38.300
 Where I think it's a little more, maybe even interesting, is using medicines

1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:44.460
 to help the person engage in the therapy as productively as possible.

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:50.300
 And here's where I think we're so limited by how we categorize medicines

1:22:50.300 --> 1:22:58.140
 and this sort of pharmaceutical, insurance-driven medical system we have

1:22:58.780 --> 1:23:01.660
 that I think throws us off in tremendous ways.

1:23:01.660 --> 1:23:05.580
 So you think about how medicines are categorized, so antidepressants.

1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:09.180
 And the vast majority of people who are helped by antidepressants,

1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:12.460
 they don't have clinically severe depression, right?

1:23:12.460 --> 1:23:16.460
 Those medicines create more distress tolerance in us, right?

1:23:16.460 --> 1:23:19.420
 And if you think about how helpful that can be, if you're going to go,

1:23:19.420 --> 1:23:22.620
 now you're going to do something difficult, where you're going to bring that trauma

1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:25.020
 or the stressors to the surface and you're going to process

1:23:25.020 --> 1:23:27.020
 and you're going to try and make life change.

1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:32.700
 If we can make more distress tolerance in us, that can be so, so much better, right?

1:23:32.700 --> 1:23:35.820
 And think about the category of medicines that are called antipsychotics,

1:23:35.820 --> 1:23:38.460
 which really puts people off, right?

1:23:38.460 --> 1:23:43.500
 But most of the prescriptions for antipsychotics are not for psychosis, right?

1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:48.060
 And there are ways in which low dosing of some of those medicines

1:23:48.060 --> 1:23:51.820
 can help intervene in negative pathways, right?

1:23:51.820 --> 1:23:56.940
 In pathways that are about distress and sending out those tendrils of neurons

1:23:56.940 --> 1:24:01.340
 that are about hypervigilance and avoidance in our brain.

1:24:01.340 --> 1:24:03.340
 And we can often get at that.

1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:05.660
 And if you can improve someone's distress tolerance

1:24:05.660 --> 1:24:10.380
 and you can use medicines that take away what clinically is rumination, right?

1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:14.780
 Not the standard meaning of that word, but the clinical meaning of it

1:24:14.780 --> 1:24:18.860
 where there are distress centers in our brain that are overactive

1:24:18.860 --> 1:24:22.140
 and then we get stuck in these maladaptive negative pathways

1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:25.100
 where we think about something over and over and over again

1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:29.500
 with no real chance of solving it because that's not what's going on inside of us.

1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:35.100
 So medicines can help that, but we have to have some flexibility around their conception.

1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:42.220
 And the modern medical system of 15-minute visits to a psychiatrist that are weeks apart,

1:24:42.220 --> 1:24:45.980
 I mean, I don't understand how that goes well, right?

1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:48.300
 In the vast majority of times, I think it doesn't go well

1:24:48.300 --> 1:24:52.940
 because it's not enough time to do the therapy to even generate the understanding.

1:24:52.940 --> 1:24:55.100
 So then medicines get thrown at the person.

1:24:55.100 --> 1:24:59.580
 This is how we use, I think, approximately five times as much medicine,

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:02.940
 I think across the board as, say, the Dutch population, right?

1:25:02.940 --> 1:25:07.420
 They think, why is five times more is a lot more medicine, right?

1:25:07.420 --> 1:25:10.940
 And they have a healthcare system and a cultural system

1:25:10.940 --> 1:25:16.300
 that to the best of my understanding is more rooted in taking responsibility for oneself, right?

1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:19.340
 So if a person comes in and cholesterol is high, right?

1:25:19.340 --> 1:25:23.020
 The first order of business is, hey, you can take better care of yourself, right?

1:25:23.020 --> 1:25:26.540
 Like this person really needs to lose some weight, exercise more, right?

1:25:26.540 --> 1:25:28.780
 They're not just jumping to like, let me give you a medicine

1:25:28.780 --> 1:25:33.740
 and shift you through the healthcare system and out the other side of the door, right?

1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:37.180
 And the same thing is true in mental health, you know?

1:25:37.180 --> 1:25:42.220
 And I'm not trying to be critical to the psychiatrist or the nurse practitioners

1:25:42.220 --> 1:25:46.940
 or people who are practicing in that way because oftentimes there is no choice, right?

1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:53.580
 If they're working in a healthcare system that the standard is highly spaced,

1:25:53.580 --> 1:25:58.140
 or spaced apart 15-minute visits, what alternative is there, right?

1:25:58.140 --> 1:26:02.700
 But to look at, okay, I'm going to use medicines because I don't have another tool to bring to bear.

1:26:03.420 --> 1:26:07.500
 So I think the healthcare system and its focus on throughput and its short-term,

1:26:07.500 --> 1:26:10.620
 talk about, you know, we talk about short-term response, right?

1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:13.820
 Short-term soothing at the expense of long-term health.

1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:18.620
 And I think that is the metaphor that applies to our healthcare system, right?

1:26:18.620 --> 1:26:23.260
 Where if we are going to try and treat a symptom in a short term,

1:26:23.260 --> 1:26:24.860
 we're going to do it in a 15-minute visit,

1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:28.940
 that we're going to do it in a way that maybe it soothes the symptom, maybe it doesn't.

1:26:28.940 --> 1:26:31.660
 But it does not get at the problem.

1:26:31.660 --> 1:26:34.860
 We need to invest more resources to get at the problem.

1:26:34.860 --> 1:26:39.340
 And I think that's where a sort of protest, you know, if people as a society,

1:26:39.340 --> 1:26:42.380
 we say, look, we don't like the way our healthcare is going.

1:26:42.380 --> 1:26:45.660
 Like we need more focus on what the actual problems are.

1:26:45.660 --> 1:26:50.300
 That yes, we would spend more money, you know, treating people and taking care of people

1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:51.980
 because it's more human time.

1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:56.060
 But ultimately less suffering, less death, right?

1:26:56.060 --> 1:26:57.820
 And ultimately more productivity.

1:26:57.820 --> 1:27:02.620
 I think as an economy, we would save so much money if we spend money

1:27:02.620 --> 1:27:06.780
 on the human aspects of mental healthcare because people would be more functional.

1:27:06.780 --> 1:27:08.540
 They're spending less time in the hospital, right?

1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:11.020
 They're more productive when they're working.

1:27:11.820 --> 1:27:14.940
 There's less entry into the criminal justice system.

1:27:14.940 --> 1:27:20.700
 So I think medicines get overused in part for systemic reasons,

1:27:20.700 --> 1:27:25.420
 in large part for systemic reasons and also for some of these categorization reasons.

1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:28.380
 Oh, that person meets some technical criteria for depression.

1:27:28.380 --> 1:27:30.860
 We've got to give them this medicine instead of really thinking, wait,

1:27:30.860 --> 1:27:32.860
 what's going on in this person?

1:27:32.860 --> 1:27:34.220
 And I see this over and over again.

1:27:34.220 --> 1:27:37.420
 I see someone who's on seven medicines and they're on seven medicines

1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:39.340
 to treat seven different symptoms.

1:27:39.340 --> 1:27:41.580
 And now they have side effects from all those seven medicines.

1:27:41.580 --> 1:27:45.180
 Maybe two of them are to treat the side effects from the other five, right?

1:27:45.180 --> 1:27:47.740
 And that's bad, right?

1:27:47.740 --> 1:27:51.980
 And if you really get at what's going on in them, now they're doing much better

1:27:51.980 --> 1:27:54.380
 and maybe they're on two medicines, right?

1:27:54.380 --> 1:27:57.500
 So I don't know if that's a helpful answer to that.

1:27:57.500 --> 1:27:57.980
 It is.

1:27:57.980 --> 1:27:59.340
 It's a very helpful answer.

1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:03.260
 I mean, I think at least in the spheres that I run these days,

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:05.740
 I hear a lot of negative statements about antidepressants.

1:28:05.740 --> 1:28:08.460
 I think, you know, I'm old enough to remember the book,

1:28:08.460 --> 1:28:15.260
 Listening to Prozac, and I remember when Prozac and things like it first started showing up

1:28:15.260 --> 1:28:20.220
 and the excitement and then nowadays I hear more about the problems with all these drugs,

1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:23.020
 you know, and maybe that's just because I have arms in the,

1:28:23.020 --> 1:28:25.260
 both the scientific, but also in the kind of wellness community

1:28:25.260 --> 1:28:27.420
 where people think a lot about behavioral change.

1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:29.900
 Fortunately, I think that they do that.

1:28:29.900 --> 1:28:34.700
 But of course, these drugs, as you mentioned, can have enormous utility as well.

1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:39.420
 I'd like to just pick up on one theme that I haven't heard a lot about anywhere else,

1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:42.300
 which is the short term versus the long term use of these drugs.

1:28:42.300 --> 1:28:47.260
 Because I could imagine, you know, someone feeling like they're finally going to tackle

1:28:47.260 --> 1:28:49.740
 something that's been inside them for a long time,

1:28:49.740 --> 1:28:54.940
 either because they're really struggling or because they're just done with not working it through.

1:28:55.500 --> 1:29:01.980
 And they decide to start a medication that would give them

1:29:01.980 --> 1:29:05.500
 higher levels of distress tolerance for a short while.

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:11.740
 I mean, is there anything to say that someone couldn't take a properly prescribed medication

1:29:11.740 --> 1:29:17.340
 for a week or for the first three months of the work and then know that they can come off it?

1:29:17.340 --> 1:29:20.140
 Because I think that the black and white model of, okay,

1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:24.380
 you're either going to start this drug and stay on it forever or be taking some drugs forever,

1:29:25.020 --> 1:29:26.860
 or you're not going to take anything.

1:29:26.860 --> 1:29:30.700
 I mean, that just seems to, life doesn't, does life have to work that way?

1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:31.020
 Right.

1:29:31.020 --> 1:29:33.500
 Is there short term use that can be effective?

1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:35.180
 Yeah, absolutely. Yes.

1:29:35.180 --> 1:29:39.260
 In American medicine, we are so much better at starting medicines

1:29:39.260 --> 1:29:41.340
 than we are at taking them away.

1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:41.740
 Right.

1:29:41.740 --> 1:29:47.660
 And part of that, I think, is driven by such a strong presence of the pharmaceutical industry.

1:29:47.660 --> 1:29:51.980
 And the pharmaceutical industry does a lot of very good things.

1:29:51.980 --> 1:29:52.700
 Right.

1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:56.700
 But, you know, there's such thing as too much of a good thing.

1:29:56.700 --> 1:29:57.180
 Right.

1:29:57.180 --> 1:30:01.900
 And then as a society, when something seems positive, this, I think, also is human nature.

1:30:01.900 --> 1:30:03.260
 We can over invest in it.

1:30:03.260 --> 1:30:03.660
 Right.

1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:09.020
 So you think about when Prozac and those kinds of medicines came out, they were safer medicines,

1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:12.700
 they're billed as antidepressants, and the thought was, well, they're going to fix depression.

1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:13.180
 Right.

1:30:13.180 --> 1:30:15.420
 And it's not how that works.

1:30:15.420 --> 1:30:15.900
 Right.

1:30:15.900 --> 1:30:22.300
 So if we look at them as tools, right, then we can deploy them sometimes for the longer term,

1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:26.380
 because sometimes that's necessary, but absolutely for the shorter term.

1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:27.980
 I mean, absolutely.

1:30:27.980 --> 1:30:32.940
 If we thought of Prozac and those kind of medicines, not as, oh, they're antidepressants.

1:30:32.940 --> 1:30:40.140
 We thought, look, what they do is they seem to make there be more serotonin in certain circuits

1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:45.500
 that are important for mood regulation, anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.

1:30:45.500 --> 1:30:49.660
 So those medicines can really help somebody if they're very severely depressed and we

1:30:49.660 --> 1:30:51.740
 want to sort of get them feeling better.

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:57.100
 They can also help someone if they could use more distress tolerance in a discrete period

1:30:57.100 --> 1:30:57.980
 of time.

1:30:57.980 --> 1:30:58.380
 Right.

1:30:58.380 --> 1:31:03.740
 When we think about them that way, we think about them as tools that we could apply for

1:31:03.740 --> 1:31:04.860
 short term or long term.

1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:07.100
 We don't see them as fixes.

1:31:07.100 --> 1:31:07.420
 Right.

1:31:07.420 --> 1:31:13.180
 And we don't see them as then substitutes for the human to human work that needs to be done.

1:31:13.180 --> 1:31:18.300
 I mean, I've been sort of in my training at times in healthcare systems and I've seen

1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:21.900
 in many other circumstances that look at medicines as answers.

1:31:21.900 --> 1:31:27.100
 And this idea that, oh, that person is a, and a lot of times there'll be a number.

1:31:27.100 --> 1:31:27.580
 Right.

1:31:27.580 --> 1:31:27.740
 Right.

1:31:27.740 --> 1:31:32.220
 And the number is the diagnosis and that number gets this medicine.

1:31:32.220 --> 1:31:35.980
 And like, I'm not sure we could be more misguided than that.

1:31:35.980 --> 1:31:38.220
 And that's what leads to adding medicines, adding medicines.

1:31:38.220 --> 1:31:38.860
 It's not working.

1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:42.060
 Of course it's not working, you know, because no one's really paying attention to what's

1:31:42.060 --> 1:31:42.380
 going on.

1:31:42.380 --> 1:31:44.860
 So add more medicines and then medicines for the medicines.

1:31:44.860 --> 1:31:46.700
 And I mean, we know this is true.

1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:52.860
 We know this is true, but we haven't had the wherewithal as a society to say, like with

1:31:52.860 --> 1:31:55.900
 a lot of things in society to say, like, this isn't okay.

1:31:55.900 --> 1:31:56.140
 Right.

1:31:56.140 --> 1:31:57.340
 I mean, we need more.

1:31:57.340 --> 1:32:00.940
 Like give these people who are trying to help us, they need more latitude to help us.

1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:05.260
 We need more human to human contact to get at what's really going on.

1:32:05.260 --> 1:32:09.980
 And yes, that's an investment of time and energy and money in the short term.

1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:11.900
 And sometimes that's money from the systems.

1:32:11.900 --> 1:32:12.380
 Right.

1:32:12.380 --> 1:32:17.260
 But if we do that, my goodness, look at the payoff of that.

1:32:18.540 --> 1:32:26.300
 What is your thought about anxiety and ADHD as a separate phenomenon in terms of medication?

1:32:26.300 --> 1:32:31.820
 Again, ADHD is the thing that seems to come up most in questions.

1:32:31.820 --> 1:32:37.020
 I can't tell you the number of, especially students, but also young working professionals

1:32:37.020 --> 1:32:44.220
 and even people who are, you know, outside those categories who are interested in or

1:32:44.220 --> 1:32:53.020
 taking Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil, or Vyvanse because they seem to struggle focusing

1:32:53.020 --> 1:32:53.580
 without it.

1:32:53.580 --> 1:32:58.700
 Or, and I don't know, because I'm not one of those individuals, or because they seem

1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:03.260
 to just like how well they can focus when they do take those compounds.

1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:08.700
 And so my understanding is these compounds mainly increase dopaminergic transmission

1:33:08.700 --> 1:33:12.220
 in the brain, also adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain.

1:33:12.220 --> 1:33:13.580
 So they're more or less stimulants.

1:33:13.580 --> 1:33:17.020
 They look a lot like, at least chemically, they look a lot like cocaine and amphetamine,

1:33:17.020 --> 1:33:19.900
 although they're not quite cocaine and amphetamine.

1:33:19.900 --> 1:33:21.580
 So should we be concerned about this?

1:33:21.580 --> 1:33:23.740
 Is this a different sort of epidemic?

1:33:24.780 --> 1:33:29.020
 Can these drugs be used to train the brain to focus and then people can withdraw from

1:33:29.020 --> 1:33:30.060
 these drugs?

1:33:30.060 --> 1:33:34.940
 I mean, I think this is a huge topic and one that maybe warrants its own episode entirely.

1:33:34.940 --> 1:33:39.340
 But as long as we're on the topic, what are your thoughts about medication for ADHD?

1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:39.980
 Sure.

1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:44.220
 I think medication for ADHD can be extremely effective.

1:33:44.220 --> 1:33:47.020
 And the studies show us that, right?

1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:53.740
 They show us that if there is ADD, then medication for ADD is very, very helpful.

1:33:53.740 --> 1:33:55.500
 And that's true in youths.

1:33:55.500 --> 1:33:59.660
 It seems to be true if adults have adult ADHD or ADD.

1:33:59.660 --> 1:34:06.060
 Like we kind of know that's true, but all attention deficit is not attention deficit

1:34:06.060 --> 1:34:07.260
 disorder, right?

1:34:07.260 --> 1:34:13.100
 And there we go to the reflexive 15 minute visits, throw medicines at things, right?

1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:16.940
 Attention deficit can come from many, many places.

1:34:16.940 --> 1:34:19.820
 And one of them is anxiety, right?

1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:21.420
 There's so many other reasons.

1:34:21.420 --> 1:34:23.180
 Depression affects attention.

1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:24.780
 Poor sleep affects attention.

1:34:24.780 --> 1:34:26.700
 Poor diet can affect attention.

1:34:26.700 --> 1:34:29.020
 Stress in life can affect attention.

1:34:29.020 --> 1:34:33.900
 So, and certainly trauma and the thing, the problems that trauma spins off can affect

1:34:33.900 --> 1:34:34.460
 attention.

1:34:34.460 --> 1:34:42.140
 So, you know, this is really the truth that while teaching once about medicines and pharmacology,

1:34:42.140 --> 1:34:47.740
 I was frustrated about how the answer to everything was like, what medicine do we use?

1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:48.700
 What medicine do we use?

1:34:48.700 --> 1:34:51.420
 As opposed to like, this is just one piece of the puzzle.

1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:56.300
 And I told an anecdote, which I think it was a clinical anecdote.

1:34:56.300 --> 1:34:57.420
 Like, what do you think is going on?

1:34:57.420 --> 1:35:02.540
 And I think that if I told that to, I don't know, middle school students or something,

1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:07.260
 they would probably say, you just told the story of a person with a rock in their shoe,

1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:10.620
 which is what I, the story that I was actually telling, right?

1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:14.140
 But several people I was talking to, they're physicians, right?

1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:16.460
 ADD, right?

1:35:16.460 --> 1:35:19.820
 It's like, no, every time the person steps down, the rock hurts and they're not able

1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:21.420
 to maintain attention, right?

1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:22.780
 Like, that's what's going on.

1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:29.740
 But we're so programmed to think about medicines and inappropriate use of ADD medicines.

1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:31.980
 As you said, there's dopaminergic impact.

1:35:31.980 --> 1:35:34.380
 There's epinephrine, norepinephrine impact.

1:35:34.380 --> 1:35:39.180
 We're affecting what are called prefrontal alpha-2 receptors that like really need to

1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:41.180
 be helped if there's real ADD.

1:35:41.180 --> 1:35:46.460
 But if there isn't, that is not a good thing to do, which is why it is quite fascinating

1:35:46.460 --> 1:35:53.740
 that when people have ADD, they tolerate generally stimulants very well without the other problems

1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:55.020
 that can come of stimulants.

1:35:55.020 --> 1:35:59.580
 And again, I don't know why that is, but we see that phenomenon.

1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:04.700
 But when people are being treated for ADD and they don't have ADD, which sometimes they

1:36:04.700 --> 1:36:08.220
 know they don't have ADD, but the stimulants make them function better, so they go to somebody

1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:12.140
 and get the stimulants, that's not a good thing to do, right?

1:36:12.140 --> 1:36:16.860
 Because stimulants, when they're not needed over time, they do affect our physical function.

1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:18.380
 They affect our judgment, right?

1:36:18.380 --> 1:36:20.620
 There are a lot of negative things that come from that.

1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:22.780
 They can affect the vigilance inside of us.

1:36:22.780 --> 1:36:30.780
 So yes, it's a valid diagnosis, but it gets made when it's not present very often, which

1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:33.500
 we see with a lot of diagnoses that you can throw medicine at.

1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:35.740
 We see the same thing with bipolar disorder.

1:36:35.740 --> 1:36:40.860
 True bipolar disorder is extremely important to utilize medicines effectively, but how

1:36:40.860 --> 1:36:45.820
 many people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder who absolutely don't have bipolar disorder?

1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:52.620
 But it can be a catch-all diagnosis because there's, in a sense, something to do for it,

1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:53.660
 in quotes, right?

1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:55.420
 And you can throw medicine at it, right?

1:36:55.420 --> 1:36:57.500
 So I mean, what do we expect, right?

1:36:57.500 --> 1:37:01.500
 If we have a healthcare system where you have 15-minute visits with your psychiatrist, of

1:37:01.500 --> 1:37:03.340
 course we're going to throw medicines at everything.

1:37:03.340 --> 1:37:07.260
 And then the training paradigms are going to look at it through that lens.

1:37:07.260 --> 1:37:11.740
 And then very often, again, I give the example of seeing somebody on seven medicines.

1:37:11.740 --> 1:37:16.300
 I mean, the first thought I have is, how many of those medicines are actually counterproductive?

1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:20.860
 And a lot of the time, it's not like, oh, every now and then one is counterproductive.

1:37:20.860 --> 1:37:21.740
 No, that's the case.

1:37:22.380 --> 1:37:24.300
 That's the case a lot of the time.

1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:29.900
 And again, I come back to, if we're not putting thought into it, what other result would we

1:37:29.900 --> 1:37:30.400
 expect?

1:37:31.900 --> 1:37:33.180
 Thank you for that answer.

1:37:33.180 --> 1:37:37.820
 I am very curious what constitutes negative effects of stimulants.

1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:43.340
 So if somebody is taking Adderall or Ritalin in order to work longer hours or focus because

1:37:43.340 --> 1:37:46.700
 they have attention deficit, but not necessarily ADHD.

1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:48.460
 And again, I'm not recommending anyone do this.

1:37:48.460 --> 1:37:52.700
 I've just heard the numbers that have come back, at least from surveys and discussions

1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:58.140
 with colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere, other college campuses that upwards of 75%

1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:04.060
 of college students use semi-regularly these drugs off, not by prescription, just to study

1:38:04.060 --> 1:38:04.620
 and to learn.

1:38:05.980 --> 1:38:09.820
 I can imagine sleep issues because these are stimulants.

1:38:09.820 --> 1:38:14.380
 What sorts of other issues can they create for people, problems they can create?

1:38:14.380 --> 1:38:19.980
 I mean, I think a touchstone maybe that's running through our conversation is prioritizing

1:38:19.980 --> 1:38:26.940
 the short-term benefit over solving a long-term problem, which we might say is a human tendency

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:29.820
 and we see it across the topics that we're discussing.

1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:33.980
 So short-term use of stimulants, sure, people are more alert.

1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:35.500
 They can stay awake more.

1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:38.220
 They can study more intensely and longer.

1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:40.460
 Okay, there's some short-term benefit of that.

1:38:40.460 --> 1:38:42.620
 Over there, even there, there can be problems, right?

1:38:43.260 --> 1:38:47.020
 But we can say, let's just say for sake of argument that in the short-term, there's

1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:48.780
 something to be gained by doing that, right?

1:38:49.340 --> 1:38:55.100
 But, oh my goodness, there's so much that is, there's so much risk to that, right?

1:38:55.100 --> 1:38:58.540
 And how many times have I seen someone who they're doing that and they're just doing

1:38:58.540 --> 1:39:00.060
 that to study, right?

1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:05.820
 And now they're addicted to the amphetamines and their behavior changes and they don't

1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:06.220
 know it.

1:39:06.220 --> 1:39:12.620
 Talk about shifting our brain towards a more defensive, you know, sort of suspicious outward

1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:16.060
 look, you know, view of the world that we see a lot of that.

1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:22.220
 So we see judgment impairment, we see heightened levels of anxiety, we see more impulsivity

1:39:22.220 --> 1:39:28.060
 in decision-making, and sometimes we can get to the point of seeing frank psychosis.

1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:33.100
 Now that's not common, but if I've seen young people who've done exactly what you're

1:39:33.100 --> 1:39:37.580
 describing, right, they're using Adderall or they're using Ritalin to study, and then

1:39:37.580 --> 1:39:41.180
 I see them when they're coming into the hospital, you know, screaming about how someone's

1:39:41.180 --> 1:39:41.980
 trying to hurt them.

1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:48.300
 Boy, it's the worst case scenario, but it shows like that's where that can go and how

1:39:48.300 --> 1:39:53.980
 much is there between the, oh, I'm just using it to study, and that severe, you know, outcome

1:39:53.980 --> 1:39:56.540
 that is actually quite negative for a person.

1:39:56.540 --> 1:40:00.220
 It might change how they think about that friendship or that relationship, right?

1:40:00.220 --> 1:40:05.420
 A lot negative happens when we change our brains without an ability to see like, what

1:40:05.420 --> 1:40:06.540
 is it actually doing to us?

1:40:06.540 --> 1:40:09.420
 So, which is part of my whole theme about trauma, right?

1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:12.300
 It changes our brains and we don't know it, right?

1:40:12.300 --> 1:40:17.820
 Well, the same can be, the same is often true of amphetamines used inappropriately.

1:40:17.820 --> 1:40:22.380
 It shifts our brain and we don't realize that we're a little bit more impulsive in our

1:40:22.380 --> 1:40:24.620
 decision-making, a little bit less trusting.

1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:28.620
 These are significant negative things that if we don't know it, the person will just

1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:30.540
 say, oh, I'm just using it to study.

1:40:30.540 --> 1:40:31.580
 I'm using it to work more.

1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:36.380
 That's not, you know, that's not without its high level of risk.

1:40:37.580 --> 1:40:39.500
 What are your thoughts on cannabis?

1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:41.660
 I've said it many times on this podcast before.

1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:45.740
 I'll say again, I feel fortunate that I've never really been attracted to alcohol or

1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:52.540
 drugs of any kind in so much so that if all the alcohol and all the marijuana and all

1:40:52.540 --> 1:40:58.060
 the cocaine and amphetamine disappeared, I wouldn't notice any change in my life, right?

1:40:59.020 --> 1:41:03.820
 And I feel lucky in that way because I know a lot of people feel an attraction to these

1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:07.500
 things as almost a gravitational force from their first drink.

1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:11.340
 They just feel, I once heard it described in this, I think it was an Augustin Burroughs

1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:13.260
 book, Dry, where he was an alcoholic.

1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:18.620
 He said that the first drink he had, it felt like this magic elixir that meshed with the

1:41:18.620 --> 1:41:21.580
 physiology of his blood in the most seamless way.

1:41:21.580 --> 1:41:23.340
 And as I was reading this, I thought, oh my goodness.

1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:28.940
 First of all, that's the most foreign experience for me in terms of alcohol.

1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:31.820
 And second, gosh, that must be terrible.

1:41:31.820 --> 1:41:35.420
 And you can, but at the same time, you could really understand why someone would be drawn

1:41:35.420 --> 1:41:35.820
 to that.

1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:41.340
 So cannabis nowadays is legal or decriminalized in many areas of the US.

1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:51.020
 A lot of people seem to use the argument, it's better than drinking or they only do

1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:52.780
 it for sleep or anxiety management.

1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:57.500
 I'm not looking to demonize or support the cannabis.

1:41:57.500 --> 1:42:01.580
 So what are your thoughts about cannabis for anxiety management, depression, and maybe

1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.660
 even for ADHD for that matter?

1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:04.300
 Sure.

1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:06.860
 If I could make an alcohol comment, right?

1:42:06.860 --> 1:42:12.220
 The number of times I've seen alcohol, like having been a good idea for coping with something,

1:42:12.220 --> 1:42:13.980
 it approaches zero, right?

1:42:13.980 --> 1:42:17.900
 Like the alcohol for coping is just never good.

1:42:17.900 --> 1:42:23.100
 And there's an additional risk factor that there's certain genetic profiles where people

1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:25.500
 respond strongly to alcohol.

1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:29.420
 Like, as you're saying, it's not just, oh, there's a little bit of short-term relief

1:42:29.420 --> 1:42:32.460
 of distress, but there's a sort of euphoric response.

1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:35.340
 And those genetics, we don't understand them completely.

1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:40.620
 They seem to be in Northern European populations, more prevalent as you had West in Northern

1:42:40.620 --> 1:42:41.260
 Europe.

1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:45.660
 So we understand that where risk factors are demographically, but we can't pinpoint that

1:42:45.660 --> 1:42:47.020
 for any one person.

1:42:47.020 --> 1:42:51.820
 And there's a tremendous risk of that when a person responds so strongly to alcohol or

1:42:51.820 --> 1:42:53.420
 habituates coping to alcohol.

1:42:54.540 --> 1:42:56.460
 Cannabis is a little bit of a different story.

1:42:56.460 --> 1:43:01.820
 I mean, how I have seen that play out, and again, this isn't coming from any expertise

1:43:01.820 --> 1:43:07.420
 around the neuropharmacology of it, like how is this really working in the brain, but it

1:43:07.420 --> 1:43:13.820
 comes from an observation that what it seems to do is to narrow our attentional perspective,

1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:14.140
 right?

1:43:14.140 --> 1:43:18.700
 So it's why people will say, well, they want to use cannabis before watching a movie with

1:43:18.700 --> 1:43:19.820
 friends or something, right?

1:43:19.820 --> 1:43:25.580
 And I think, okay, I think why people are doing that is because a cognitive spectrum

1:43:25.580 --> 1:43:29.500
 narrows, and then instead of worrying about that thing at work or that relationship issue,

1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:30.780
 one can just be present, right?

1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:34.780
 For it gates out other attentional intrusions, right?

1:43:35.420 --> 1:43:39.660
 So in some ways, I mean, I've absolutely seen it be helpful to people.

1:43:39.660 --> 1:43:44.700
 I mean, it's been legalized in Oregon, which is where I spend a lot of my time, and it's

1:43:44.700 --> 1:43:46.460
 not where all of my practice is.

1:43:46.460 --> 1:43:50.540
 But what I have seen is it is at times helpful, say, around sleep, right?

1:43:50.540 --> 1:43:54.540
 Because a person can gate out other intrusive thoughts, and they can just relax and go to

1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:55.260
 sleep.

1:43:55.260 --> 1:44:00.540
 But there can be another side of that, too, that at higher levels of distress, right,

1:44:00.540 --> 1:44:06.300
 stress, at higher levels of tension, what it can do is narrow the focus of cognition

1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.620
 to the thing that is negative, right?

1:44:08.620 --> 1:44:15.260
 So the idea that, oh, like, this is a treatment for, you know, depression, anxiety, trauma

1:44:15.260 --> 1:44:16.940
 is not true, right?

1:44:16.940 --> 1:44:19.740
 Can it be helpful under certain circumstances?

1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:21.260
 Like, I think the answer to that is yeah.

1:44:21.260 --> 1:44:24.220
 I mean, I know the answer to that is yes, because I've seen it play out clinically that

1:44:24.220 --> 1:44:24.700
 way.

1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:26.700
 But it can also be harmful, too.

1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:31.660
 So there, again, like anything that has any power, power to influence our brains, we want

1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:33.500
 to be thoughtful and careful about it.

1:44:33.500 --> 1:44:35.580
 I mean, do I think that it's safer than alcohol?

1:44:36.140 --> 1:44:36.540
 Yes.

1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:39.260
 I mean, I think we so clearly see that.

1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:41.740
 Does that mean it was just uniformly safe?

1:44:41.740 --> 1:44:42.700
 No, right?

1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:47.500
 So we want to be respectful of anything that can change how our brain is working, and I

1:44:47.500 --> 1:44:51.340
 think that includes, certainly includes alcohol, and I think it certainly includes cannabis,

1:44:51.340 --> 1:44:51.820
 too.

1:44:51.820 --> 1:44:55.900
 I'd love to talk about psychedelics for two reasons.

1:44:56.540 --> 1:45:01.580
 One, there seems to be a tremendous amount of interest in psychedelics as a therapeutic

1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:02.700
 clinical tool.

1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:06.380
 I know there's also recreational use, and I'll just preface all this by saying that

1:45:07.260 --> 1:45:12.700
 my stance is we absolutely know for sure that these are controlled substances.

1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:16.860
 They're illegal to possess, sell, or use in most of the country.

1:45:16.860 --> 1:45:19.820
 There are a few areas where they are decriminalized.

1:45:19.820 --> 1:45:25.820
 Um, they are decriminalized, um, and psychedelics is a broad category, of course, and we can

1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:28.380
 touch on some of the different, um, different ones.

1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:35.100
 But whereas five years or so, five years ago or so, I was truly afraid to say the word

1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:37.100
 psychedelics in any kind of public venue.

1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:44.940
 There are laboratories at Stanford working on ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA, mostly in animal

1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:45.500
 models.

1:45:45.500 --> 1:45:51.180
 There's terrific work going on at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Matthew Johnson's

1:45:51.180 --> 1:45:56.220
 lab and others looking at the clinical applications, mainly of high-dose psilocybin and LSD.

1:45:56.220 --> 1:45:58.220
 There's the MAPS trials with MDMA.

1:45:58.220 --> 1:46:02.860
 So nowadays, it's safe for an academic like me to say the word psychedelics.

1:46:02.860 --> 1:46:07.900
 And I'd love to approach this question of psychedelics from a place of true exploration

1:46:07.900 --> 1:46:13.580
 and curiosity, but with the preface that, uh, we're talking about this in a legal

1:46:13.580 --> 1:46:14.540
 clinical setting.

1:46:14.540 --> 1:46:18.300
 Um, and the legality is something that's now in process.

1:46:19.020 --> 1:46:22.140
 I don't think it's completed, but that's my understanding.

1:46:22.140 --> 1:46:23.260
 But there are trials.

1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:29.740
 There are, you can go to clinicaltrials.gov, uh, and put in MDMA and you'll see a bunch

1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:32.860
 of clinical trials that are happening in the recruiting subjects.

1:46:32.860 --> 1:46:37.980
 Um, so I think it's safe to have the conversation now and, uh, I'd love your thoughts about

1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:38.700
 psychedelics.

1:46:38.700 --> 1:46:45.020
 Maybe we could start with, um, psilocybin and LSD as a, as a broad category of drugs

1:46:45.020 --> 1:46:49.900
 that at least my understanding is they touch on mainly the serotonin system, some specific

1:46:49.900 --> 1:46:56.780
 receptor activation and modulation tend to change notions of space and time, adjust internal

1:46:56.780 --> 1:46:57.340
 state.

1:46:57.340 --> 1:47:00.540
 Maybe we would start there and then maybe venture into some of the other ones.

1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:06.140
 So what are your thoughts on these drugs for therapeutic potential, also potential hazards,

1:47:06.860 --> 1:47:07.740
 et cetera?

1:47:07.740 --> 1:47:08.220
 Yeah.

1:47:08.220 --> 1:47:13.260
 I think if we look at the true psychedelic, so psilocybin and LSD, because ketamine and

1:47:13.260 --> 1:47:15.500
 MDMA, they're different categories of medicine.

1:47:15.500 --> 1:47:18.220
 They're these sort of novel tools to bring to bear.

1:47:18.860 --> 1:47:25.500
 But if we start with psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics, I think why it is, why they

1:47:25.500 --> 1:47:32.300
 have gained so much momentum over the last several years is because the data coming from

1:47:32.300 --> 1:47:38.140
 the, the labs and the academic centers, um, is so powerfully positive.

1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:42.780
 And as someone who's, I'm interested in anything that's potentially helpful, right?

1:47:42.780 --> 1:47:46.940
 And I want to learn and understand that because a lot of things that are potentially helpful,

1:47:46.940 --> 1:47:50.220
 you know, you go and look at the data and you see that that's not helpful or that's

1:47:50.220 --> 1:47:51.100
 harmful.

1:47:51.100 --> 1:47:56.780
 I think what we have seen with psychedelics is that they're so helpful, right?

1:47:56.780 --> 1:47:58.460
 And, and the trials are bearing that out.

1:47:58.460 --> 1:48:02.620
 And of course these are used in professional hands and with the right kind of guidance

1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:07.340
 are extremely powerful tools, but used in the right way by, by someone who knows how

1:48:07.340 --> 1:48:13.020
 to utilize them in the right set and setting can have an immense positive impact.

1:48:13.020 --> 1:48:18.620
 And that's why I think that the thought is there across people and more and more people

1:48:18.620 --> 1:48:21.180
 feel comfortable saying it and talking about it.

1:48:21.180 --> 1:48:25.180
 I mean, we're in the state of Oregon now where, where the, the thought is we're moving

1:48:25.180 --> 1:48:32.220
 towards legalization of psilocybin early in 2023 and it's part of the new data, right?

1:48:32.220 --> 1:48:34.540
 And how it meshes with the older data, right?

1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:39.660
 How it meshes with data from the sixties and seventies that showed such a strong, powerful

1:48:39.660 --> 1:48:41.180
 impact of these medicines.

1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:45.340
 And I have a whole set of thoughts about what's happening there and they're just, they're

1:48:45.340 --> 1:48:46.140
 conjectures, right?

1:48:46.140 --> 1:48:52.300
 But, but my read of, you know, as best I can try and understand the neuroscience and, and

1:48:52.300 --> 1:48:58.700
 and the clinical applicability and the changes is, you know, what happens is we see less

1:48:58.700 --> 1:49:03.100
 communication, less chatter in the outer parts of the brain, right?

1:49:03.100 --> 1:49:04.620
 The outer parts of the cortex.

1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:11.420
 And I think that as human beings, we sort of glorify the parts of the brain that only

1:49:11.420 --> 1:49:12.380
 we have.

1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:14.700
 I mean, certainly in my growing up, right?

1:49:14.700 --> 1:49:15.980
 I mean, what did I learn?

1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:18.700
 Even if you think about like learning about the brain in high school, right?

1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:23.420
 I learned that like, wow, we're great as humans because we have language and other animals

1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:27.980
 don't and we can use tools and like, aren't we so great because we have this part of the

1:49:27.980 --> 1:49:31.420
 brain that other animals don't and it lets us function, right?

1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:32.780
 Okay.

1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:34.540
 There's some truth to that, right?

1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:42.060
 That, that, that we can do things others can't do, but we, we get lost often in the outer

1:49:42.060 --> 1:49:46.220
 parts of the cortex, which I think are about survival, right?

1:49:46.220 --> 1:49:50.380
 So we come back to the things you and I talked about early on of like, why are these trauma

1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:51.820
 mechanisms in us, right?

1:49:51.820 --> 1:49:55.020
 So much of what's going on in our brains is about survival.

1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:58.460
 And I think living, so to speak, in the cortex, right?

1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:03.420
 In the outer part of the brain is consistent with a focus on survival.

1:50:03.420 --> 1:50:07.260
 So if you think that's where language is, that's where vision is, that's where executive

1:50:07.260 --> 1:50:10.940
 function is, so planning and task execution.

1:50:10.940 --> 1:50:16.380
 So, so much of that is about making our way in the world around us.

1:50:16.380 --> 1:50:20.620
 So we tend to glorify that and think, well, that's in a sense where our existence is,

1:50:20.620 --> 1:50:21.260
 right?

1:50:21.260 --> 1:50:24.060
 And I believe that is not true, right?

1:50:24.060 --> 1:50:25.580
 And again, can I say that for sure?

1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:26.780
 Of course not, right?

1:50:26.780 --> 1:50:31.340
 But my read of 20 years of doing clinical work and thinking about all sorts of medicines

1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:36.540
 and, and thinking about the psychedelics with a, in a lot of depth, I think that what they

1:50:36.540 --> 1:50:41.180
 do is they take us out of the cortex, right, because that's where we run into these problems.

1:50:41.180 --> 1:50:45.420
 That's where we bounce things over and over again, that the distress centers deep in our

1:50:45.420 --> 1:50:50.780
 brain, in the brainstem, kind of ally with the outer parts of the cortex.

1:50:50.780 --> 1:50:53.820
 And they say, right, we're in distress, we want to stay alive.

1:50:53.820 --> 1:50:58.140
 You know, often, a lot of us have had trauma that makes these changes in the brain.

1:50:58.140 --> 1:51:02.460
 And then we're thinking all the time, like, what would I do if, if there were war?

1:51:02.460 --> 1:51:05.180
 What would I do if there's civil war, if someone bombs us?

1:51:05.180 --> 1:51:07.580
 What will I do if the, if the economy collapses, right?

1:51:07.580 --> 1:51:09.260
 What will I do if somebody gets sick?

1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:15.580
 We're thinking all this future projection that is all coming from a place of fear, right?

1:51:15.580 --> 1:51:19.900
 It's all coming from a desire to think about things and control the future with this part

1:51:19.900 --> 1:51:23.500
 of the brain that is so uniquely human, right?

1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:29.020
 And I think when we take the neurotransmission out of those places, right, and we set it

1:51:29.020 --> 1:51:33.260
 in a part of the brain and say the insular cortex, right, the parts of the brain that

1:51:33.260 --> 1:51:38.380
 are sort of in the middle, right, which, which I think, I believe is where our humanness

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.340
 really is.

1:51:39.340 --> 1:51:44.460
 So the psychedelics make there be less chatter, communication, these other parts of the brain,

1:51:44.460 --> 1:51:51.020
 and then we become seated in the part of the brain that I believe is most about our experience

1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:56.300
 of true humanness, which is why when you read about, you know, people who have experiences,

1:51:56.300 --> 1:51:58.700
 and I've heard about them, people talk to me about this, right?

1:51:58.700 --> 1:52:01.180
 They've, they've utilized it, they talk with me.

1:52:01.180 --> 1:52:05.500
 So whether it's someone telling me their story or it's coming from research data, you know,

1:52:05.500 --> 1:52:11.660
 it's why people can sort of see with clarity that, oh, that trauma, like, that thing is

1:52:11.660 --> 1:52:13.020
 not my fault, right?

1:52:13.020 --> 1:52:17.500
 Like, we feel a sense of compassion for ourselves, we relieve ourselves, release ourselves from

1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:21.340
 guilt, and it's like, why is this so helpful to people?

1:52:21.340 --> 1:52:27.180
 And I think it's because it can do what we are trying to get at in good therapy, but

1:52:27.180 --> 1:52:32.860
 it can really catalyze that by just putting a person in that part of the brain that can

1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:37.740
 see it for what it is without all that chatter in the cortex about how you got to think it's

1:52:37.740 --> 1:52:40.860
 your fault or you won't avoid it again, and that makes the repetition compulsion.

1:52:40.860 --> 1:52:44.220
 How do I think ahead to the next thing that might happen and what else bad might happen?

1:52:44.220 --> 1:52:46.300
 I mean, we don't get anywhere doing that.

1:52:46.300 --> 1:52:51.100
 And I think where we get somewhere is when we seat ourselves deeper in the brain, which

1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:55.180
 I think we do if we're, like, doing really good therapy and we're, you know, we're in

1:52:55.180 --> 1:53:01.740
 the deep parts of the brain, but these psychedelics, the medicinal value, I believe, is putting

1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:05.500
 us in that part of the brain where a person can really find truth.

1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:12.140
 And that's why I think that it's come so far in these few years because I think that is

1:53:12.140 --> 1:53:17.420
 very clinically evident, and I think we're going to see more and more the value of that

1:53:17.420 --> 1:53:23.420
 and how what the psychedelics do can become, I believe, a heuristic for understanding,

1:53:23.420 --> 1:53:28.620
 like, wait, how are our brains really functioning and what are the parts that really matter

1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:31.420
 to our experience of being human?

1:53:31.420 --> 1:53:35.580
 It's those parts of the brain, right, the deep parts of the brain, the insular cortex

1:53:35.580 --> 1:53:42.060
 and the areas around it that, say, light up when a person has an experience of spiritual

1:53:42.060 --> 1:53:45.900
 ecstasy or an experience of connection with another person, right?

1:53:45.900 --> 1:53:50.940
 We kind of have these telltale markers that something is going on there that's very important

1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:55.260
 and very special, and I think we're more attracted to the outer parts of the brain in part because

1:53:55.260 --> 1:53:56.700
 they're easier to study, right?

1:53:56.700 --> 1:54:00.620
 I mean, as you know better than I do, we started studying the brain through lesion studies,

1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:04.220
 right, because it's easier to see if a person got hurt in this part of the brain or had

1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:06.700
 a stroke in that part of the brain, what changes?

1:54:06.700 --> 1:54:11.420
 So we look at the cortex because, one, it's easier to study, and we tend to glorify it,

1:54:11.420 --> 1:54:18.780
 and I think that has been misguided, and I think that we're learning about how that's

1:54:18.780 --> 1:54:24.540
 been misguided through the study of these novel modalities from Western perspectives,

1:54:24.540 --> 1:54:28.940
 which, of course, they've been used for a long, long time in other cultures, but novel

1:54:28.940 --> 1:54:29.900
 from our perspective.

1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:35.100
 Yeah, I'm fascinated by this idea that in these middle brain structures is where our

1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:42.380
 humanity lies, and as you said, I also wonder whether or not other animals experience life

1:54:42.380 --> 1:54:45.260
 more from that orientation with less chatter.

1:54:45.260 --> 1:54:52.860
 We can only guess, but, you know, the dog lover and being in the presence of animals

1:54:52.860 --> 1:54:57.340
 that seem to just be present in what's happening in their immediate environment, not too much

1:54:57.900 --> 1:54:58.940
 anticipation.

1:54:58.940 --> 1:55:03.740
 Right, I mean, what you're talking about is sentience is important, and sentience is extremely

1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:08.220
 important, right, and if we're going to overvalue, say, language, then I think we undervalue

1:55:08.220 --> 1:55:13.580
 sentience, right, which is why I think we tend to undervalue animals, right, and their

1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:16.780
 suffering, because, well, they're not saying anything about it, right, and, you know, they're

1:55:16.780 --> 1:55:21.020
 not writing about it, so, okay, it's easy to ignore, and we think about, again, the

1:55:21.020 --> 1:55:24.780
 hubris of that, right, though, because we can think and talk and write, like, we must

1:55:24.780 --> 1:55:28.140
 be feeling more than species that don't do that.

1:55:28.140 --> 1:55:33.500
 I mean, I think that is so true, and that we're going to understand more about sentience

1:55:33.500 --> 1:55:39.900
 and other species and how, you know, that's at the core of existence, and my hope would

1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:46.220
 be that we value more humans and animals, right, through the evolution of that understanding.

1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:55.900
 The hallucinations that accompany psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin have such an attractive

1:55:55.900 --> 1:56:02.700
 force to them as a concept and as an experience, and so I think most often when people hear

1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:07.900
 hallucinogens, they think, and psychedelics, they think about hallucinating, right, makes

1:56:07.900 --> 1:56:14.300
 sense why they would, but what's so interesting to me is nothing in your answer about psychedelics,

1:56:14.300 --> 1:56:17.740
 psilocybin, and LSD focused on hallucinations per se.

1:56:17.740 --> 1:56:22.620
 It was more about feeling states, accessing a feeling state or a relation to an event

1:56:22.620 --> 1:56:24.300
 or to a person or to oneself.

1:56:24.300 --> 1:56:29.580
 Maybe even I caught hints of maybe even empathy for oneself for the first time.

1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:36.300
 None of that had to do with seeing sounds or hearing colors and, you know, these kind

1:56:36.300 --> 1:56:38.940
 of cliche statements about hallucinations.

1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:44.300
 So I am aware of laboratories, one at University of California Davis in particular, but a few

1:56:44.300 --> 1:56:51.660
 others that are trying to generate chemical variants of psychedelics that lack the hallucinogenic

1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:57.500
 properties but maintain these other properties as therapeutic tools, and as I say that, I

1:56:57.500 --> 1:57:02.940
 realize that people in the psychedelic community are probably thinking, oh, that's horrible.

1:57:02.940 --> 1:57:07.820
 That's the dismantling of the core thing, but the simple question is, do you think the

1:57:07.820 --> 1:57:09.740
 hallucinations are valuable for anything?

1:57:09.740 --> 1:57:15.740
 And I think we're really getting into the philosophical, right, the ontological, right.

1:57:15.740 --> 1:57:21.500
 There's this sort of trying to understand being, right, and I don't claim to know the

1:57:21.500 --> 1:57:22.380
 answer to that.

1:57:22.380 --> 1:57:32.060
 I think that at times it seems like the hallucinations have a metaphorical or a symbolic way of being

1:57:32.060 --> 1:57:38.860
 helpful, right, because people will come to understand things that they hold dear and

1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:46.780
 true after the experience, right, that often, not always, come through the lens of the hallucinations.

1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:49.180
 So are the hallucinations necessary?

1:57:50.140 --> 1:57:53.420
 Are those hallucinations sometimes important, sometimes not?

1:57:53.420 --> 1:57:58.460
 I mean, I think we don't understand that, and I think we want to be respectful of sort

1:57:58.460 --> 1:57:59.740
 of mystery of that.

1:57:59.740 --> 1:58:05.020
 But what I think is fascinating is you think about like substance abuse and what that means

1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:09.580
 is, well, one aspect of that is that a person has experiences, thoughts, conceptions of

1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:13.900
 self in the world with the substance that without the substance they know are wrong,

1:58:13.900 --> 1:58:14.060
 right.

1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:17.500
 People talk about, you know, liquid courage, right, and okay, I feel better about myself

1:58:17.500 --> 1:58:19.420
 and I feel courageous because I've had a couple of drinks.

1:58:19.420 --> 1:58:25.100
 Now after that, I feel like normal about myself, and that was false, right.

1:58:25.100 --> 1:58:29.580
 And we see that like that's part of what substance intoxication means, right.

1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:35.260
 But what we see with the psychedelic medicines is something that's incredibly different,

1:58:35.260 --> 1:58:40.940
 right, that people are having experiences that are so de-linked from our normal experience

1:58:40.940 --> 1:58:42.060
 of reality.

1:58:42.060 --> 1:58:47.500
 And then when they come in a sense back online with in a normal cognitive way, they realize

1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:52.300
 like, wow, now I'm applying all those mechanisms of trying to understand truth and to that.

1:58:52.300 --> 1:58:54.620
 And what I see is that it's true.

1:58:54.620 --> 1:58:55.820
 And wow, it's true.

1:58:55.820 --> 1:59:00.060
 Like, I mean, we have that all the time, which tells me, hey, something different is going

1:59:00.060 --> 1:59:00.940
 on there.

1:59:00.940 --> 1:59:05.180
 And of course, these are powerful tools, so misused, like very bad things can happen.

1:59:05.180 --> 1:59:11.100
 But you think about the clinical utility and what does it mean that so many people change

1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:16.860
 for the healthier or even change their lives after an experience because it so resonates

1:59:16.860 --> 1:59:19.100
 as like, oh, now I understand something that's true.

1:59:19.100 --> 1:59:20.460
 And it's not something bizarre.

1:59:20.460 --> 1:59:23.420
 It's like I wasn't responsible for being raped that time.

1:59:23.420 --> 1:59:29.100
 Or, you know, I'm not less than even though my sexuality or my gender identity is different

1:59:29.100 --> 1:59:31.340
 from some silly binary concept, right?

1:59:31.340 --> 1:59:35.100
 Like people kind of often get it and they feel differently about themselves and guilt

1:59:35.100 --> 1:59:36.540
 and shame are impacted.

1:59:36.540 --> 1:59:42.860
 So I think we're likely to see that they are powerful anti-trauma mechanisms, again, used

1:59:42.860 --> 1:59:44.620
 clinically in the right hands.

1:59:44.620 --> 1:59:49.180
 And I think that we're also going to see that they're heuristic for understanding our brain

1:59:49.180 --> 1:59:53.900
 that goes against what I see as some of the reflexive hubris of, well, the outer parts

1:59:53.900 --> 1:59:57.900
 must be the best because that's what makes us human and other animals don't have it.

1:59:57.900 --> 1:59:59.100
 And we're better because we're human.

1:59:59.100 --> 2:00:00.220
 It means it makes no sense.

2:00:00.220 --> 2:00:00.940
 You know?

2:00:00.940 --> 2:00:02.860
 I'd like to talk about MDMA.

2:00:03.660 --> 2:00:06.380
 And I'll preface this by saying I was a participant.

2:00:06.380 --> 2:00:09.580
 Actually, technically, I'm still a participant in a clinical trial.

2:00:09.580 --> 2:00:11.980
 So I have experience of doing it twice.

2:00:12.860 --> 2:00:16.460
 The trial involves three separate dosings of this.

2:00:16.460 --> 2:00:23.500
 One is I was reluctant to do it outside of a clinical trial, mostly because I was aware

2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:25.180
 there can be some cardiac effects.

2:00:25.180 --> 2:00:27.260
 And I liked the idea there'd be a clinician on hand.

2:00:27.260 --> 2:00:35.580
 And I'll just say that I found the experiences to be profound, beneficial, and very different

2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:38.940
 from one session to the next.

2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:48.300
 The first one felt a whole collection of ideas and relational things came up that felt very

2:00:48.300 --> 2:00:49.660
 powerful and transformative.

2:00:49.660 --> 2:00:51.740
 And I do think that I learned there.

2:00:51.740 --> 2:00:53.740
 I exported a number of things.

2:00:53.740 --> 2:00:55.980
 My particular experience isn't relevant here.

2:00:55.980 --> 2:00:58.860
 But the second time I expected it to be the same way.

2:00:58.860 --> 2:01:07.420
 And it was very mellow and relaxing and was deeply tied to notions of acceptance.

2:01:07.420 --> 2:01:11.100
 So there weren't all these revelations and wow, new insights.

2:01:11.100 --> 2:01:16.460
 It was very much about grounding into a kind of a calmer state.

2:01:16.460 --> 2:01:21.580
 So I have the personal experience of benefiting from these in ways that I think still benefit

2:01:21.580 --> 2:01:25.340
 me and was very struck by the power of MDMA.

2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:31.260
 And my very crude understanding of the pharmacology and the state that is being under MDMA is

2:01:31.260 --> 2:01:37.500
 that it encourages or increases dopaminergic transmission, but also serotonergic transmission,

2:01:37.500 --> 2:01:41.740
 which is to my knowledge, a kind of a rare state for the brain to be in that typically

2:01:41.740 --> 2:01:47.260
 it's more of a seesaw of dopaminergic drive towards external goals or more serotonergic

2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:52.300
 drive towards more placidity or comfort with what one already has.

2:01:52.300 --> 2:01:56.700
 And so with both those systems amplified, the only way I can describe it subjectively

2:01:56.700 --> 2:02:02.140
 is that everything sort of funneled back in and it was almost like a pursuit of inner

2:02:02.140 --> 2:02:09.340
 landscape and I can only imagine what it would be like in the context of doing this with

2:02:09.340 --> 2:02:11.500
 somebody else also taking MDMA.

2:02:11.500 --> 2:02:12.780
 I have no idea what that's like.

2:02:13.500 --> 2:02:15.420
 That's my report of the experience.

2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:17.980
 I know that the experience can vary.

2:02:17.980 --> 2:02:23.820
 What are your thoughts about the chemistry and what sorts of states do you think MDMA

2:02:23.820 --> 2:02:31.100
 is creating that can explain why it's a useful therapeutic tool in some cases and what sorts

2:02:31.100 --> 2:02:32.940
 of cases those might be?

2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:33.740
 Sure, sure.

2:02:35.180 --> 2:02:39.580
 To clarify, I think part of what we're starting with is like this is very different than the

2:02:39.580 --> 2:02:43.500
 psychedelics, right, which are seeding our consciousness in these deep centers of the

2:02:43.500 --> 2:02:50.140
 brain, right, whereas what MDMA is doing is sort of flooding with positive neurotransmitters,

2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:51.820
 right, in certain parts of the brain.

2:02:51.820 --> 2:02:58.700
 And I think what that creates is a greater permissiveness inside to entertain or approach

2:02:59.260 --> 2:03:00.860
 different things, right.

2:03:00.860 --> 2:03:06.460
 So I think where we see it's tremendous, my read of the data is around potentially and

2:03:06.460 --> 2:03:10.380
 we're seeing in some of the trials, right, tremendous benefit for trauma, right.

2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:14.700
 And you think about what we were talking about earlier, how this reflexive guilt, shame,

2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:21.420
 hypervigilance avoidance, right, and when these systems are flooded with these neurotransmitters

2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:25.180
 it's more permissive to sort of think about that, right, and to think about that without,

2:03:25.180 --> 2:03:29.260
 again, all the chatter of that's your fault or you're never going to get anywhere because

2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:33.100
 of that or you know what that means, right, they can kind of go away and then we can think

2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:36.700
 about it in a way that isn't through the lens of fear, right.

2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:42.300
 And I think that's the power there is that it's permissive of approaching something,

2:03:42.300 --> 2:03:46.380
 contemplating something, you know, a different, a novelty.

2:03:46.380 --> 2:03:51.660
 We talk about a de novo approach and I think that's also why the experience can vary

2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:56.940
 because you could also see how if you're not thinking about something, right, so there's

2:03:56.940 --> 2:04:02.540
 not a clinical guidance to it, you could be in a state where like I just feel good, right,

2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:07.260
 and I'm thinking about good things and like that can feel good, right, but that's not

2:04:07.260 --> 2:04:09.340
 necessarily problem solving, right.

2:04:09.340 --> 2:04:14.460
 So the clinical guidance says, hey, let's take that state and do something with it,

2:04:14.460 --> 2:04:19.020
 right, now that you're in this state, hey, let's make cable, the sun is shining, right,

2:04:19.020 --> 2:04:23.660
 you're in a state where we can look at things that are traumatic, right, we can approach

2:04:23.660 --> 2:04:27.820
 them from a de novo perspective and I think it's part, I think that explains why you

2:04:27.820 --> 2:04:31.660
 had these different experiences from one to the other because your brain is just in a

2:04:31.660 --> 2:04:36.860
 state that's conducive to something, right, but if there's not the mechanism to have that

2:04:36.860 --> 2:04:40.780
 thing happen, like conducive to something therapeutic, then you might go there on your

2:04:40.780 --> 2:04:45.580
 own or you might just be in a state where you have a sense of well-being and you sit

2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:46.460
 with that.

2:04:46.460 --> 2:04:49.980
 Which sort of seems like a waste to me, I mean this is what I tell people when they

2:04:49.980 --> 2:04:56.140
 ask about MDMA, I said at least from my experience that the potential hazard there is that in

2:04:56.140 --> 2:05:01.340
 that very high dopaminergic, serotonergic state, there were moments where I felt like

2:05:01.340 --> 2:05:06.460
 I could get excited about any one specific concept that I might even just think about,

2:05:06.460 --> 2:05:11.740
 for instance, you know, water and how nourishing it is and really just go down the path of

2:05:11.740 --> 2:05:17.180
 water and the world and all the water and you can, you know, you're in a state that

2:05:17.180 --> 2:05:22.620
 is very prone to suggestion, internal suggestion and so the guidance turned out, the guidance

2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:27.420
 from the clinician turned out to be immensely valuable in allowing me to go into my own

2:05:27.420 --> 2:05:33.660
 head for bits of time but then also to resurface and share and exchange in a way that to, I'm

2:05:33.660 --> 2:05:37.180
 trying to really get something out of it that was useful and that I could export because

2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:40.940
 of course water is wonderful but I'm not really interested in growing my relationship

2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:46.140
 to water and I really felt like I could understand for the, I never went to raves or anything

2:05:46.140 --> 2:05:50.700
 growing up, I never did MDMA recreationally but I understood for the first time how people

2:05:50.700 --> 2:05:54.780
 could get really attached to an environment and feel connected to things because I think

2:05:54.780 --> 2:05:59.500
 with all that serotonin, you just feel connected to everything around you so I think it's

2:05:59.500 --> 2:06:05.180
 a slippery slope there and I don't know what the future of the clinical use of MDMA looks

2:06:05.180 --> 2:06:10.620
 like but I would hope that whoever's thinking about guiding these sessions is really thinking

2:06:10.620 --> 2:06:16.060
 carefully also about evolving the practice to help people really move through in a sequential

2:06:16.060 --> 2:06:18.780
 way so they can leave with something valuable.

2:06:18.780 --> 2:06:25.340
 Yes, 100% and 100%, these are such powerful tools and if they're powerful tools and we're

2:06:25.340 --> 2:06:31.980
 using them without respect for them, right, without clinical guidance, we incur risk,

2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:35.740
 right, I mean you know getting obsessed with water, well and it probably isn't going to

2:06:35.740 --> 2:06:41.340
 hurt you, right, but if someone is out using it, there's around other people, what one

2:06:41.340 --> 2:06:45.260
 can feel positively about or become sort of obsessed in the short term about can be very

2:06:45.260 --> 2:06:49.900
 counterproductive, right, there can be a lot of risk to that so I think it anchors back

2:06:49.900 --> 2:06:55.180
 to these are very powerful tools, we're coming to understand them much much more and we're

2:06:55.180 --> 2:07:00.140
 coming to understand that they have immense potential to be helpful to us but I think

2:07:00.140 --> 2:07:07.660
 and hope that that only also increases our respect for those modalities and what can

2:07:07.660 --> 2:07:11.100
 come, what negative can happen if we're not respectful.

2:07:11.660 --> 2:07:15.340
 This can be very interesting to see where all of this goes in the next few years, not

2:07:15.340 --> 2:07:19.660
 just in Oregon but elsewhere, it's one way or another, it's happening, it seems to have

2:07:19.660 --> 2:07:25.500
 a momentum that is not going to stop so very exciting area to be sure.

2:07:25.500 --> 2:07:25.980
 I agree.

2:07:27.020 --> 2:07:28.620
 I have a question about language.

2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:34.300
 In your book, you talk about how we need to be careful about the use of language around

2:07:34.300 --> 2:07:40.380
 trauma and maybe problem solving and problem describing in general, you know, on at one

2:07:40.380 --> 2:07:46.700
 extreme you hear that your brain and your body hear every word you say and you know

2:07:46.700 --> 2:07:51.420
 we have to be so careful with language and that actually frightened me for a number of

2:07:51.420 --> 2:07:54.620
 years because I would hear that and I thought, gosh, if I just think that something is bad,

2:07:54.620 --> 2:07:58.460
 now it's going to hurt me worse, which itself is part of that whole, you know, packing

2:07:58.460 --> 2:08:04.780
 down of an issue, very hard to avoid thoughts without distraction.

2:08:06.380 --> 2:08:08.140
 So that's one extreme.

2:08:08.140 --> 2:08:14.540
 On the other hand, you know, I can say, I can tell somebody I love them with a tone

2:08:14.540 --> 2:08:17.900
 of hatred, I can tell somebody I hate them with a tone of love.

2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:23.340
 So how should we think about language in parsing trauma?

2:08:23.340 --> 2:08:28.220
 And in your book, you talk about, you give some cautionary notes about talking about

2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:36.060
 depression, trauma, and PTSD in terms that might diminish their real severity in some

2:08:36.060 --> 2:08:39.180
 cases and I was really struck by that.

2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:44.300
 So maybe just touch on, you know, how should we talk about these things in a way that doesn't

2:08:44.300 --> 2:08:49.660
 diminish them for ourselves or for other people and at the same time honors the fact that

2:08:49.660 --> 2:08:54.540
 there's a lot of trauma out there and there's a lot of depression out there and we need

2:08:54.540 --> 2:08:55.660
 to talk about it.

2:08:55.660 --> 2:09:00.380
 Yeah, I think this is a very complicated and in many ways convoluted topic.

2:09:00.380 --> 2:09:05.580
 Like I think it's wonderful that we have language, but boy, language leads us astray

2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:06.620
 often too.

2:09:06.620 --> 2:09:09.340
 You think about how we, how people define words.

2:09:09.340 --> 2:09:13.340
 Like what, someone says a word, what is it, does a person know what that word means?

2:09:13.340 --> 2:09:15.100
 What nuance are they taking from it?

2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:20.220
 That we just have to be very careful what we're saying and what we're communicating.

2:09:20.220 --> 2:09:25.260
 And I think this doesn't mean because, you know, there's a sort of phenomenon now where

2:09:25.260 --> 2:09:27.820
 people are trying to control language, I think too much.

2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:30.380
 Like you can't say anything that someone else might find hurtful.

2:09:30.380 --> 2:09:35.260
 You have to refer to people in ways they choose to be referred to, even if those are ways

2:09:35.260 --> 2:09:40.540
 that others don't understand or ways they themselves have decided or ways that might

2:09:40.540 --> 2:09:43.660
 be psychologically or clinically unhelpful.

2:09:43.660 --> 2:09:49.820
 So I think the overcontrol of language is not good, but I think the specificity of language

2:09:49.820 --> 2:09:53.740
 of what are we trying to say, how are we defining it, even the word trauma.

2:09:53.740 --> 2:09:56.620
 We're talking about trauma, so we want to define what that means, right?

2:09:56.620 --> 2:09:59.580
 It doesn't just mean like anything kind of negative, right?

2:09:59.580 --> 2:10:02.540
 Because then that dilutes it down to meaning nothing, right?

2:10:02.540 --> 2:10:07.580
 It also doesn't just mean, you know, injury in combat, right?

2:10:07.580 --> 2:10:09.340
 Like we have to talk about what that is.

2:10:09.340 --> 2:10:13.180
 So I think anchoring it to something that rises to the magnitude of overwhelming our

2:10:13.180 --> 2:10:17.900
 coping skills and changing us, like then at least I define it that way and I can communicate

2:10:17.900 --> 2:10:21.580
 that to you and we can understand what we're talking about, right?

2:10:21.580 --> 2:10:26.620
 I think that another aspect of language, while again we need this middle ground and I don't

2:10:26.620 --> 2:10:32.780
 think that it is okay for the overcontrol of language to shut down expression, but we

2:10:32.780 --> 2:10:38.220
 also have to acknowledge, you know, how we're so much less distanced from each other through

2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:42.540
 social media and I think social media can do very, very good things as hopefully we're

2:10:42.540 --> 2:10:43.900
 doing now, right?

2:10:43.900 --> 2:10:48.300
 But it can also be used to harm people from a distance, right?

2:10:48.300 --> 2:10:53.900
 And how much hatefulness is there out there that I think comes from anger and frustration

2:10:53.900 --> 2:10:55.820
 in people, you know, back to trauma, right?

2:10:55.820 --> 2:10:59.980
 Where people just want to be angry and it's not really issues that they're talking about,

2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:06.060
 but then there's a target of that anger and, you know, people feel beleaguered by that

2:11:06.060 --> 2:11:11.900
 and the words that people use sometimes are so awful that someone reading that, like if

2:11:11.900 --> 2:11:14.860
 you're in the demographic that's being targeted, right?

2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:21.740
 And you're reading that, I mean, how does a person not feel, not feel beset upon, vulnerable,

2:11:21.740 --> 2:11:22.300
 right?

2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:26.700
 And then I think that also fuels, you know, things like we just had this terrible shooting

2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:27.500
 in Buffalo, right?

2:11:27.500 --> 2:11:29.820
 Like just hate motivated, right?

2:11:29.820 --> 2:11:34.220
 And I think that because that kind of language becomes very real to people who may take it

2:11:34.220 --> 2:11:38.380
 in, it fuels their hate, and then they do something to enact it, which of course creates

2:11:38.380 --> 2:11:41.260
 greater fear and vulnerability.

2:11:41.260 --> 2:11:47.660
 And I think there was some civility and decorum that was in our world not that long ago, right?

2:11:47.660 --> 2:11:50.620
 I mean, you know, I'm in my early 50s, I'm not that old, right?

2:11:50.620 --> 2:11:57.020
 But I remember a time when in political discourse, people were civil to one another, right?

2:11:57.020 --> 2:11:59.900
 Now, so much, I mean, it's not all of it, right?

2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:03.180
 But there's an acceptance of things that are just bombastic, right?

2:12:03.180 --> 2:12:09.980
 There's like, it's a circus sideshow sometimes of people being just angry and aggressive.

2:12:09.980 --> 2:12:13.740
 And it's not really linked to anything, although it's allegedly linked to something, but then

2:12:13.740 --> 2:12:15.820
 other people's anger can attach to it.

2:12:15.820 --> 2:12:19.260
 And it's not about what it's about, but it's about aligning with the anger.

2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:25.340
 And I think that there is so much damage that comes from that.

2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:31.900
 And I think, you know, should we have, should it be okay that people sometimes are talking,

2:12:31.900 --> 2:12:36.620
 communicating, using language in ways that would like get us suspended from middle school,

2:12:36.620 --> 2:12:37.260
 right?

2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:39.500
 Ways I don't want my eight-year-old to see.

2:12:39.500 --> 2:12:41.660
 I mean, is that really okay?

2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:45.020
 Or do we need to take a stand for the rational use of language?

2:12:45.020 --> 2:12:49.580
 I don't want my use of language to be over-controlled by someone who thinks they sort of understand

2:12:49.580 --> 2:12:52.460
 better than the rest of us, how to communicate with those, okay?

2:12:52.460 --> 2:12:53.180
 I don't want that.

2:12:53.180 --> 2:12:57.420
 What's stereotypically a sort of idea of the left, say, right?

2:12:57.420 --> 2:12:58.860
 At least in our society.

2:12:58.860 --> 2:13:07.420
 But I also don't want language that can be so angry and so aggressive that it is perpetuating

2:13:07.420 --> 2:13:11.980
 or spreading vulnerability and that it facilitates trauma.

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:17.100
 And I think we could set standards as a society where we say, look, I don't want anybody in

2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:19.500
 power who's going to behave that way, right?

2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:22.860
 I don't care if their whole agenda is like, make Paul Conte's life better.

2:13:22.860 --> 2:13:25.020
 I'm still not going to vote for you, right?

2:13:25.020 --> 2:13:28.780
 If you're behaving towards others in a way that's denigrating, you're behaving in a way

2:13:28.780 --> 2:13:31.660
 that I feel essentially ashamed of, right?

2:13:31.660 --> 2:13:33.100
 And I feel that a lot, right?

2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:36.060
 I see the politics, you know, I see things play out.

2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:39.580
 It's not always political, of course, not always political, but I see things play out

2:13:39.580 --> 2:13:41.660
 and I think, oh my gosh, I feel embarrassed.

2:13:41.660 --> 2:13:43.660
 Like we're somehow okay with this.

2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:47.260
 Well, it doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum it's coming to.

2:13:47.260 --> 2:13:53.980
 And I think that's an indicator that what we're doing is really hurtful to us.

2:13:53.980 --> 2:13:55.340
 People become more angry.

2:13:55.340 --> 2:13:56.620
 They attach to the anger.

2:13:56.620 --> 2:13:58.060
 People feel more beleaguered.

2:13:58.060 --> 2:14:02.140
 There's more divisions between us and it seems more and more like, well, we can only really

2:14:02.140 --> 2:14:05.340
 identify with people who are just like us and like, what does that really mean?

2:14:05.340 --> 2:14:11.580
 I mean, the divisions that it creates between us and that, you know, that promotes so many

2:14:11.580 --> 2:14:12.620
 negative things, right?

2:14:12.620 --> 2:14:15.340
 I mean, think about ways in which it promotes white supremacy, right?

2:14:15.340 --> 2:14:16.780
 It's just one example, right?

2:14:16.780 --> 2:14:22.860
 And we've seen that play out that this is really bad for us and we've got to look at that.

2:14:22.860 --> 2:14:27.180
 I mean, if we don't look at that, I don't think it's always something is going to happen.

2:14:27.180 --> 2:14:28.780
 Like something is happening, right?

2:14:28.780 --> 2:14:29.500
 It's happening now.

2:14:30.060 --> 2:14:30.460
 Yeah.

2:14:30.460 --> 2:14:35.660
 And it really, to my mind, it really seeps down into the soil of everything that we're

2:14:35.660 --> 2:14:38.220
 talking about on all sides.

2:14:38.220 --> 2:14:38.700
 Yes.

2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:40.380
 People are activated.

2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:45.020
 People are upset about one thing or the other, right?

2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:50.780
 No one is immune from upset regardless of political affiliation and everybody seems

2:14:50.780 --> 2:14:52.940
 to be upset nowadays.

2:14:52.940 --> 2:14:58.620
 And as I was hearing you talk about this, I feel a lot of resonance with what you said.

2:14:58.620 --> 2:15:00.940
 And I also am hoping you run for office.

2:15:00.940 --> 2:15:02.940
 Thank you.

2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:06.540
 I don't think I have the gumshoe for that, but thank you for that.

2:15:06.540 --> 2:15:07.980
 Oh, that would be wonderful.

2:15:07.980 --> 2:15:08.380
 Thank you.

2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:14.060
 I'd like to talk about a concept of taking care of oneself.

2:15:14.060 --> 2:15:15.500
 This comes up in the book.

2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:15.980
 Yes.

2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:18.060
 This is something we talk a lot about on this podcast.

2:15:18.060 --> 2:15:22.700
 I mean, I think people have heard me blab endlessly and I'll probably go into the grave

2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:26.460
 telling people to get sunlight in their eyes when they can and to try and get proper sleep

2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:33.340
 and to have a few tools for reducing their anxiety in real time and on and on and on.

2:15:33.340 --> 2:15:33.840
 Right.

2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:41.180
 You know, we hear about this concept of taking care of oneself and I think at a surface level,

2:15:41.180 --> 2:15:43.020
 it can sound a little bit light.

2:15:43.020 --> 2:15:45.820
 You know, oh, take care, take care, take good care.

2:15:45.820 --> 2:15:49.900
 You know, but to me, it's a deep and powerful concept.

2:15:49.900 --> 2:15:57.340
 And I was very happy to see it in your book and also to learn a lot of ideas about what

2:15:57.340 --> 2:16:02.780
 that really looks like because whether or not somebody is in the early stages of considering

2:16:02.780 --> 2:16:07.020
 whether or not they have trauma or is in the deep stages of working that through or has

2:16:07.020 --> 2:16:12.540
 made it through the tunnel some distance, taking one care of oneself is an ongoing process.

2:16:12.540 --> 2:16:20.860
 I'd love for you to just describe what taking care of oneself means to you as a clinician.

2:16:20.860 --> 2:16:25.180
 And of course, the practices and things that you encourage people to do.

2:16:25.180 --> 2:16:28.860
 But how should we think about taking care of oneself?

2:16:28.860 --> 2:16:36.060
 Because on one extreme, you could imagine massages or treats, vacations and chefs for

2:16:36.060 --> 2:16:38.220
 hire that take care of everything for ourselves.

2:16:38.220 --> 2:16:43.980
 And on the other extreme, you could say, you know, leaning into life in a way that you're

2:16:43.980 --> 2:16:46.860
 paying attention to small things while working very, very hard.

2:16:48.060 --> 2:16:49.820
 So, it's such a big concept.

2:16:49.820 --> 2:16:52.380
 But how do you think about taking care of oneself?

2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:54.220
 How should I take care of myself?

2:16:54.220 --> 2:16:55.820
 How should people take care of themselves?

2:16:55.820 --> 2:16:56.320
 Sure.

2:16:56.860 --> 2:17:00.780
 I see here what I think is a very fascinating dichotomy, right?

2:17:00.780 --> 2:17:04.540
 That in some ways, think about how complex our brains are, right?

2:17:04.540 --> 2:17:08.300
 How complex our psyches, our unconscious minds are.

2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:09.900
 There's so much complexity there.

2:17:10.540 --> 2:17:17.100
 But on the other hand, psychological concepts that are consistent with health are often

2:17:17.100 --> 2:17:18.620
 very simple, right?

2:17:18.620 --> 2:17:20.940
 By which I don't mean light, right?

2:17:20.940 --> 2:17:23.820
 But simple, straightforward, right?

2:17:23.820 --> 2:17:26.460
 And I think self-care is absolutely one of them.

2:17:26.460 --> 2:17:31.260
 I mean, how much is talked about how to take care of oneself that just skips over the basics

2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:33.660
 that are necessary as a building block for all else.

2:17:33.660 --> 2:17:39.020
 It doesn't matter how many chefs or vacations or whatever a person has if the basics of

2:17:39.020 --> 2:17:41.020
 self-care aren't squared away.

2:17:41.020 --> 2:17:46.220
 And it's not a light concept to say like, look, are you sleeping enough, right?

2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:47.340
 Are you eating well?

2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:49.420
 Are you getting natural light?

2:17:49.420 --> 2:17:52.860
 Are you interacting with people who are good to interact with, right?

2:17:52.860 --> 2:17:56.300
 Are you accepting negative interactions in your life?

2:17:56.300 --> 2:18:00.220
 Are you living in circumstances that make you feel okay or not?

2:18:00.220 --> 2:18:07.580
 They're very, very basic premises, but so often we're not looking at them at all, right?

2:18:07.580 --> 2:18:11.900
 We're not looking at them at all because we tend to skip over them.

2:18:11.900 --> 2:18:17.180
 And we tend to skip over them either because, again, in some automatic way that sometimes

2:18:17.180 --> 2:18:19.980
 is trauma-driven, we're not going to look at that, right?

2:18:19.980 --> 2:18:24.380
 And often not taking care of ourselves can have the punishment, distraction, right?

2:18:24.380 --> 2:18:30.780
 There's so much that can come into that or our sense of power is tied to not taking care

2:18:30.780 --> 2:18:31.260
 of ourselves.

2:18:31.260 --> 2:18:37.900
 I mean, an example is I tend to, for whatever reason, do reasonably well with very poor

2:18:37.900 --> 2:18:39.180
 self-care, right?

2:18:39.180 --> 2:18:43.020
 And like that was very adaptive when I was in some medical training, right?

2:18:43.020 --> 2:18:45.500
 And I'm like, okay, I can eat a lot today.

2:18:45.500 --> 2:18:46.460
 I can not eat, right?

2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:47.660
 I can sleep two hours.

2:18:47.660 --> 2:18:48.700
 I can sleep eight, right?

2:18:49.660 --> 2:18:51.580
 I mean, overall, that's not good.

2:18:51.580 --> 2:18:55.740
 And it hasn't been good for me as I've aged, but then I realized something.

2:18:55.740 --> 2:18:58.460
 Look, I'm doing all these things that make myself healthier, but like what?

2:18:58.460 --> 2:19:00.140
 I ignore that, right?

2:19:00.140 --> 2:19:01.180
 And why am I ignoring it?

2:19:01.180 --> 2:19:01.820
 That was a key question.

2:19:01.820 --> 2:19:03.020
 Why am I ignoring it?

2:19:03.020 --> 2:19:07.980
 Because somewhere inside of me as it was, and still to some extent is, this idea that

2:19:07.980 --> 2:19:12.940
 my ability to be really functional, right, to generate success in the world around me

2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:15.420
 is tied to my ability to do that, right?

2:19:16.060 --> 2:19:19.980
 But if I stop doing that and now I'm eating and sleeping regularly, then I'm going to

2:19:19.980 --> 2:19:25.500
 lose some edge and so even I think about this all the time, but I realize, hey, I'm also

2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:27.420
 I'm not doing it inside, you know?

2:19:27.420 --> 2:19:33.820
 And I think it's really grounding to the basics that really help us of like, what are the

2:19:33.820 --> 2:19:36.300
 basics of what I'm doing and not doing in my life?

2:19:36.300 --> 2:19:40.860
 Diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances, leisure activities.

2:19:40.860 --> 2:19:42.140
 I mean, sunlight.

2:19:42.140 --> 2:19:46.220
 I mean, I think immensely important and dramatically undervalued.

2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:50.700
 Well, I want to thank you for that and I want to thank you for today's discussion.

2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:56.380
 I found it to be incredibly informative and I know our listeners will also.

2:19:56.380 --> 2:19:58.460
 I also want to thank you for the work you do.

2:19:58.460 --> 2:20:04.140
 I mean, you obviously run an incredibly robust clinical practice that I'm aware that you're

2:20:04.140 --> 2:20:08.300
 constantly trying to improve, even though it's operating at the highest levels already.

2:20:08.300 --> 2:20:08.860
 I appreciate that.

2:20:08.860 --> 2:20:15.100
 And I really, the reason why you're here today is because I've done a wide and deep

2:20:15.100 --> 2:20:18.380
 search for people in these areas.

2:20:18.380 --> 2:20:25.100
 And there are so few who have the background in medical training and physiology in the

2:20:25.100 --> 2:20:32.060
 psychoanalytic and psychiatric realm and also have a grounding toward the future, you know,

2:20:32.060 --> 2:20:37.500
 of what's coming and who can encapsulate so many different orientations and bring them

2:20:37.500 --> 2:20:39.500
 together into a coherent piece.

2:20:39.500 --> 2:20:42.540
 So I really thank you.

2:20:42.540 --> 2:20:48.860
 Yeah, and for your book, which is incredible, I will go on record saying I think this is

2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:54.300
 the definitive book on trauma and I really encourage people to read it and will continue

2:20:54.300 --> 2:20:55.580
 to encourage people to read it.

2:20:55.580 --> 2:20:59.740
 It's so many valuable takeaways and insights and tools there.

2:20:59.740 --> 2:21:05.260
 So on behalf of the listeners and myself, thank you so much for joining us today.

2:21:05.820 --> 2:21:10.300
 You're very welcome and I take that to heart and I'm very appreciative of being here.

2:21:10.300 --> 2:21:12.780
 So you're very welcome and thank you as well.

2:21:12.780 --> 2:21:13.660
 Thank you.

2:21:13.660 --> 2:21:15.740
 Thank you for joining me for my discussion with Dr.

2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:16.780
 Paul Conte.

2:21:16.780 --> 2:21:22.780
 I also highly recommend that you explore his new book, which is trauma, the invisible epidemic,

2:21:22.780 --> 2:21:25.340
 how trauma works and how we can heal from it.

2:21:25.340 --> 2:21:29.740
 It's an exceptional resource, both for those that have trauma and those that don't have

2:21:29.740 --> 2:21:33.260
 trauma or those that suspect they might have trauma.

2:21:33.260 --> 2:21:38.860
 Again, it's a deep dive into what trauma is and offers many simple tools that anyone can

2:21:38.860 --> 2:21:42.940
 apply with a therapist or not in order to heal from trauma.

2:21:42.940 --> 2:21:44.460
 And if you'd like to learn more about Dr.

2:21:44.460 --> 2:21:50.380
 Conte and the work he does directly with patients, please check out his website, pacificpremiergroup.com.

2:21:50.380 --> 2:21:55.420
 We've also provided a link to both the book and pacificpremiergroup.com in the show note

2:21:55.420 --> 2:21:55.900
 captions.

 That is the best way to support this podcast.

2:22:29.500 --> 2:22:33.740
 Not so much in today's episode, but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,

2:22:33.740 --> 2:22:35.420
 we discuss supplements.

2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:39.820
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from

2:22:39.820 --> 2:22:44.620
 them for things like improving the transition time and the depth of sleep each night, for

2:22:44.620 --> 2:22:49.660
 improving focus, for managing anxiety, and for many other aspects of mental health, physical

2:22:49.660 --> 2:22:51.260
 health, and performance.

2:22:51.260 --> 2:22:55.980
 For that reason, the Huberman Lab podcast has partnered with Momentous Supplements because

2:22:55.980 --> 2:22:58.460
 first off, they are of the very highest quality.

2:22:58.460 --> 2:23:02.380
 They also ship internationally, which many other supplement companies do not.

2:23:02.380 --> 2:23:08.300
 And we wanted to have a one-stop location where people could find and access the supplements

2:23:08.300 --> 2:23:10.540
 that are discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:23:10.540 --> 2:23:15.900
 So if you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman, you will find many of the supplements that

2:23:15.900 --> 2:23:18.140
 are commonly discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:23:18.140 --> 2:23:22.220
 I should just mention that the catalog of supplements there will be expanding in the

2:23:22.220 --> 2:23:26.620
 weeks and months to follow, but already a number of them for sleep and focus and other

2:23:26.620 --> 2:23:31.260
 aspects of mental health, physical health, and performance are already there at livemomentous.com

2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:32.300
 slash Huberman.

2:23:32.300 --> 2:23:36.700
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

2:23:36.700 --> 2:23:40.860
 There I cover science and science-based tools, some of which overlaps with the content of

2:23:40.860 --> 2:23:44.780
 the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the information covered on

2:23:44.780 --> 2:23:45.980
 the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:23:46.620 --> 2:23:51.100
 We also have a newsletter called the Neural Network Newsletter, where we offer distilled

2:23:51.100 --> 2:23:51.980
 information.

2:23:51.980 --> 2:23:55.500
 So lists of protocols and key takeaways from podcast episodes.

2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:58.860
 If you want to sign up for the newsletter, all it requires is your email.

2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:01.260
 Please know that we do not share your email with anybody.

2:24:01.260 --> 2:24:03.340
 We have a very clear privacy policy.

2:24:03.340 --> 2:24:06.060
 You can find all that by going to HubermanLab.com.

2:24:06.060 --> 2:24:09.900
 There's a menu there where you can sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:24:09.900 --> 2:24:13.740
 You can also immediately get access to some example newsletters.

2:24:13.740 --> 2:24:16.300
 So you know what the newsletter is all about.

2:24:16.300 --> 2:24:20.300
 So thank you once again for joining me for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte.

2:24:20.300 --> 2:24:31.020
 And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
