00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.180
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.180 --> 00:13.180
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.180 --> 00:15.100
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.740
 Today, my guest is Dr. Eric Jarvis.

00:17.740 --> 00:20.500
 Dr. Jarvis is a professor at the Rockefeller University

00:20.500 --> 00:23.580
 in New York City, and his laboratory studies

00:23.580 --> 00:26.680
 the neurobiology of vocal learning, language,

00:26.680 --> 00:29.020
 speech disorders, and remarkably,

00:29.020 --> 00:32.620
 the relationship between language, music, and movement,

00:32.620 --> 00:34.500
 in particular, dance.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.180
 His work spans from genomics,

00:37.180 --> 00:40.860
 so the very genes that make up our genome,

00:40.860 --> 00:42.700
 and the genomes of other species

00:42.700 --> 00:44.280
 that speak and have language,

00:44.280 --> 00:46.840
 such as songbirds and parrots,

00:46.840 --> 00:48.420
 all the way up to neural circuits,

00:48.420 --> 00:50.700
 that is the connections in the brain and body

00:50.700 --> 00:53.180
 that govern our ability to learn and generate

00:53.180 --> 00:56.220
 specific sounds and movements coordinated with those sounds,

00:56.220 --> 00:58.180
 including hand movements,

00:58.180 --> 01:01.300
 and all the way up to cognition,

01:01.300 --> 01:04.040
 that is our ability to think in specific ways

01:04.040 --> 01:05.540
 based on what we are saying

01:05.540 --> 01:07.340
 and the way that we comprehend

01:07.340 --> 01:10.860
 what other people are saying, singing, and doing.

01:10.860 --> 01:14.680
 As you'll soon see, I was immediately transfixed

01:14.680 --> 01:18.020
 and absolutely enchanted by Dr. Jarvis's description

01:18.020 --> 01:20.300
 of his work and the ways that it impacts

01:20.300 --> 01:22.540
 all the various aspects of our lives.

01:22.540 --> 01:26.300
 For instance, I learned from Dr. Jarvis that as we read,

01:26.300 --> 01:28.660
 we are generating very low levels

01:28.660 --> 01:30.940
 of motor activity in our throat.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.500
 That is, we are speaking the words that we are reading

01:34.380 --> 01:36.940
 at a level below the perception of sound

01:36.940 --> 01:39.300
 or our own perception of those words,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.900
 but if one were to put an amplifier

01:40.900 --> 01:43.940
 or to measure the firing of those muscles

01:43.940 --> 01:45.220
 in our vocal cords,

01:45.220 --> 01:47.260
 we'd find that as we're reading information,

01:47.260 --> 01:49.860
 we are actually speaking that information.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.860
 And as I learned and you'll soon learn,

01:51.860 --> 01:55.060
 there's a direct link between those species in the world

01:55.060 --> 01:57.400
 that have song and movement,

01:57.400 --> 01:59.500
 which many of us would associate with dance,

01:59.500 --> 02:03.500
 and our ability to learn and generate complex language.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.540
 So for people with speech disorders like stutter

02:06.540 --> 02:07.860
 or for people who are interested

02:07.860 --> 02:09.900
 in multiple language learning,

02:09.900 --> 02:11.940
 bilingual, trilingual, et cetera,

02:11.940 --> 02:14.340
 and frankly, for anyone who is interested

02:14.340 --> 02:18.060
 in how we communicate through words written or spoken,

02:18.060 --> 02:19.780
 I'm certain today's episode is going to be

02:19.780 --> 02:22.660
 an especially interesting and important one for you.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.800
 Dr. Jarvis's work is so pioneering

02:24.800 --> 02:27.220
 that he has been awarded truly countless awards.

02:27.220 --> 02:28.460
 I'm not going to take our time

02:28.460 --> 02:30.980
 to list off all the various important awards

02:30.980 --> 02:32.180
 that he's received,

02:32.180 --> 02:33.780
 but I should point out that in addition

02:33.780 --> 02:35.780
 to being a decorated professor

02:35.780 --> 02:37.240
 at the Rockefeller University,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.420
 he is also an investigator

02:38.420 --> 02:40.160
 with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.260
 the so-called HHMI.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.820
 And for those of you that don't know,

02:43.820 --> 02:46.340
 HHMI investigators are selected

02:46.340 --> 02:49.060
 on an extremely competitive basis

02:49.060 --> 02:50.620
 that they have to re-up,

02:50.620 --> 02:53.120
 that is they have to re-compete every five years.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.060
 They actually receive a grade every five years

02:56.060 --> 02:57.280
 that dictates whether or not

02:57.280 --> 02:59.940
 they are no longer a Howard Hughes investigator,

02:59.940 --> 03:01.300
 whether or not they can advance

03:01.300 --> 03:03.920
 to another five years of funding

03:03.920 --> 03:05.400
 for their important research.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.820
 And indeed, Howard Hughes investigators are selected

03:07.820 --> 03:09.620
 not just for the rigor of their work,

03:09.620 --> 03:11.200
 but for their pioneering spirit

03:11.200 --> 03:13.460
 and their ability to take on high risk,

03:13.460 --> 03:15.460
 high benefit work,

03:15.460 --> 03:16.740
 which is exactly the kind of work

03:16.740 --> 03:20.100
 that Dr. Jarvis has been providing for decades now.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.560
 Again, I think today's episode

03:21.560 --> 03:23.500
 is one of the more unique and special episodes

03:23.500 --> 03:25.140
 that we've had on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

03:25.140 --> 03:27.680
 I single it out because it really spans

03:27.680 --> 03:29.500
 from the basic to the applied.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.140
 And Dr. Jarvis's story is an especially unique one

03:32.140 --> 03:35.060
 in terms of how he arrived at becoming a neurobiologist.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.620
 So for those of you that are interested

03:36.620 --> 03:38.800
 in personal journey and personal story,

03:38.800 --> 03:42.700
 Dr. Jarvis's is truly a special and important one.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.580
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:44.580 --> 03:46.900
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.140
 We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.820
 First of all, they ship internationally

03:50.820 --> 03:52.180
 because we know that many of you

03:52.180 --> 03:54.240
 are located outside of the United States.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.260
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

03:56.260 --> 03:58.800
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.480
 both in terms of purity and precision

04:00.480 --> 04:02.420
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.060
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

04:05.060 --> 04:07.260
 that are single ingredient supplements

04:07.260 --> 04:09.300
 and that are supplied in dosages

04:09.300 --> 04:12.280
 that allow you to build a supplementation protocol

04:12.280 --> 04:14.100
 that's optimized for cost,

04:14.100 --> 04:15.980
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

04:15.980 --> 04:18.140
 and that you can add things and remove things

04:18.140 --> 04:19.460
 from your protocol in a way

04:19.460 --> 04:21.260
 that's really systematic and scientific.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.420
 If you'd like to see the supplements

04:22.420 --> 04:23.760
 that we partner with Momentous on,

04:23.760 --> 04:26.860
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

04:26.860 --> 04:27.980
 There you'll see those supplements,

04:27.980 --> 04:30.460
 and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

04:30.460 --> 04:33.140
 the library of supplements available through Momentous

04:33.140 --> 04:34.100
 on a regular basis.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.640
 Again, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.020
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:39.020 --> 04:41.700
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.500
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:43.500 --> 04:46.060
 to bring zero cost and consumer information about science

04:46.060 --> 04:48.660
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:48.660 --> 04:49.660
 In keeping with that theme,

04:49.660 --> 04:52.360
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.580
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.900
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:56.900 --> 04:59.380
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:59.380 --> 05:00.860
 to help you better meet your immediate

05:00.860 --> 05:02.460
 and long-term health goals.

05:02.460 --> 05:05.180
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

05:05.180 --> 05:07.380
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

05:07.380 --> 05:09.220
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

05:09.220 --> 05:12.020
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.220
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

05:14.220 --> 05:16.100
 you can also get insight into, for example,

05:16.100 --> 05:17.480
 what your biological age is

05:17.480 --> 05:19.440
 and compare that to your chronological age.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.180
 The problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests,

05:22.180 --> 05:23.940
 however, is you get information back

05:23.940 --> 05:27.440
 about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth,

05:27.440 --> 05:28.860
 but you don't know what to do

05:28.860 --> 05:30.780
 with or about that information.

05:30.780 --> 05:33.540
 Inside Tracker solves that problem with a simple platform

05:33.540 --> 05:36.140
 that allows you to click on any specific factor,

05:36.140 --> 05:38.700
 learn more about it and what it does in your brain and body,

05:38.700 --> 05:41.380
 and also the various nutritional supplementation

05:41.380 --> 05:43.380
 and other types of interventions you can take

05:43.380 --> 05:45.420
 to bring the levels of that factor

05:45.420 --> 05:49.060
 into the ranges that are optimal for you and your health.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.440
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:50.440 --> 05:53.180

05:59.700 --> 06:02.060
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.020
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:04.020 --> 06:05.900
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.920
 They also have some really unique features

06:07.920 --> 06:10.100
 that make them especially attractive

06:10.100 --> 06:13.380
 from the standpoint of aesthetics and performance.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.380
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

06:15.380 --> 06:17.300
 from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses

06:17.300 --> 06:19.940
 and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.720
 Initially, the eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:21.720 --> 06:22.760
 were designed for sport,

06:22.760 --> 06:24.780
 that is for running and for cycling, et cetera.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.180
 And indeed, still their eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:27.180 --> 06:29.180
 are very lightweight and they won't slip off your face

06:29.180 --> 06:32.120
 if you get sweaty, but they also have a terrific aesthetic.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.740
 You can wear them to work, you can wear them out to eat.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.900
 I wear readers at night when I work or if I drive

06:37.900 --> 06:39.380
 and I wear sunglasses sometimes

06:39.380 --> 06:40.660
 during the middle of the day,

06:40.660 --> 06:43.380
 if it's too bright and I need sunglasses in order to see.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.020
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,

06:46.020 --> 06:48.540
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com

06:51.620 --> 06:53.420
 Again, that's R-O-K-A.com

06:53.420 --> 06:55.600
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.260
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.860
 Element is an electrolyte drink

06:59.860 --> 07:02.500
 that has everything you need and nothing you don't,

07:02.500 --> 07:07.140
 meaning no sugar, but plenty of the correct ratios

07:07.140 --> 07:09.760
 of sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.580
 And those three electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium

07:12.580 --> 07:15.060
 are critical for your neuron, your nerve cell function,

07:15.060 --> 07:16.900
 and for the function of all the cells

07:16.900 --> 07:18.580
 in your brain and body.

07:18.580 --> 07:20.520
 I've mentioned this before on the podcast,

07:20.520 --> 07:24.020
 but I'm a fan of salt, not taking too much salt,

07:24.020 --> 07:26.320
 but certainly not getting too little salt.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.180
 Element has 1000 milligrams, that is one gram of salt,

07:29.180 --> 07:31.420
 which might sound like a lot of salt, but for many people,

07:31.420 --> 07:34.220
 especially people who are following low carbohydrate diets

07:34.220 --> 07:37.700
 or who are exercising or sweating a lot or both,

07:37.700 --> 07:39.940
 that level of salt can actually help you

07:39.940 --> 07:41.100
 in many circumstances.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.540
 Getting the appropriate level of salt,

07:42.540 --> 07:44.260
 and certainly the appropriate levels of electrolytes

07:44.260 --> 07:45.740
 will improve your cognitive function

07:45.740 --> 07:48.180
 and will improve your physical performance.

07:48.180 --> 07:50.660
 If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,

07:50.660 --> 07:53.260
 that's lmnt.com slash Huberman,

07:53.260 --> 07:55.540
 and you'll get a free sample pack with your order.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.980
 That's drinklmnt.com slash Huberman.

07:58.980 --> 08:02.380
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Eric Jarvis.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.100
 Eric, so great to have you here.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.380
 Thank you.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.240
 Very interested in learning from you

08:07.240 --> 08:12.020
 about speech and language, and even as I asked the question,

08:12.020 --> 08:14.820
 I realized that a lot of people, including myself,

08:14.820 --> 08:17.220
 probably don't fully appreciate the distinction

08:17.220 --> 08:19.540
 between speech and language, right?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.440
 Speech I think of as the motor patterns,

08:21.440 --> 08:25.740
 the production of sound that has meaning, hopefully,

08:25.740 --> 08:29.100
 and language, of course, come in various languages

08:29.100 --> 08:31.860
 and varieties of ways of communicating.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.740
 But in terms of the study of speech and language

08:34.740 --> 08:37.260
 and thinking about how the brain organizes

08:37.260 --> 08:40.420
 speech and language, what are the similarities?

08:40.420 --> 08:41.380
 What are the differences?

08:41.380 --> 08:43.180
 How should we think about speech and language?

08:43.180 --> 08:46.800
 Yeah, well, I'm glad you invited me here,

08:46.800 --> 08:50.140
 and I'm also glad to get that first question,

08:50.140 --> 08:52.580
 which I can consider a provocative one.

08:52.580 --> 08:55.420
 The reason why, I've been struggling,

08:55.420 --> 08:57.380
 what is the difference with speech and language

08:57.380 --> 09:00.760
 for many years, and realize why am I struggling

09:00.760 --> 09:03.100
 is because there are behavioral terms,

09:03.100 --> 09:07.740
 let's call them psychology-developed kind of terms,

09:07.740 --> 09:12.660
 that don't actually align exactly with brain function, right?

09:12.660 --> 09:13.500
 And the question is,

09:13.500 --> 09:15.660
 is there a distinction between speech and language?

09:15.660 --> 09:18.000
 And when I look at the brain of work

09:18.000 --> 09:20.060
 that other people have done, work we have done,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.900
 also compared it with animal models,

09:21.900 --> 09:23.380
 like those who can imitate sounds,

09:23.380 --> 09:25.580
 like parrots and songbirds,

09:25.580 --> 09:29.580
 I start to see there really isn't such a sharp distinction.

09:29.580 --> 09:32.360
 So to get at what I think is going on,

09:32.360 --> 09:35.700
 let me tell you how some people think of it now,

09:35.700 --> 09:38.380
 that there's a separate language module in the brain

09:39.460 --> 09:42.280
 that has all the algorithms and computations

09:42.280 --> 09:46.300
 that influence the speech pathway on how to produce sound,

09:46.300 --> 09:51.140
 and the auditory pathway on how to perceive and interpret it

09:51.140 --> 09:55.120
 for speech or for sound that we call speech.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.120
 And it turns out, I don't think there is any good evidence

10:00.120 --> 10:02.120
 for a separate language module.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.800
 Instead, there is a speech production pathway

10:06.800 --> 10:10.040
 that's controlling our larynx, controlling our jaw muscles,

10:10.040 --> 10:14.160
 that has built within it all the complex algorithms

10:14.160 --> 10:18.200
 for spoken language, and there's the auditory pathway

10:18.200 --> 10:20.840
 that has built within it all the complex algorithms

10:20.840 --> 10:22.480
 for understanding speech,

10:22.480 --> 10:24.840
 not separate from a language module.

10:24.840 --> 10:30.160
 And this speech production pathway is specialized to humans

10:30.160 --> 10:32.560
 and parrots and songbirds,

10:32.560 --> 10:35.280
 whereas this auditory perception pathway

10:35.280 --> 10:38.120
 is more ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom,

10:38.120 --> 10:39.960
 and this is why dogs can understand,

10:39.960 --> 10:44.840
 sit, siente se, come here, boy, get the ball, and so forth.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.580
 Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.320
 Great apes, you can teach them for several thousand,

10:51.320 --> 10:52.760
 but they can't say a word.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.320
 Fascinating.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.100
 Because you've raised a number of animal species

10:58.100 --> 11:01.720
 early on here, and because I have basically an obsession

11:01.720 --> 11:03.560
 with animals since the time I was very small,

11:03.560 --> 11:08.560
 I have to ask, which animals have language?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.960
 Which animals have modes of communication

11:11.960 --> 11:14.120
 that are sort of like language?

11:14.120 --> 11:16.320
 You know, I've heard whale songs.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.560
 I don't know what they're saying.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.520
 They sound very beautiful,

11:18.520 --> 11:21.760
 but they could be insulting each other for all I know.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.160
 And they very well may be.

11:24.160 --> 11:28.480
 Dolphins, birds, I mean, what do we understand

11:28.480 --> 11:32.800
 about modes of communication that are like language

11:32.800 --> 11:36.400
 but might not be what would classically be called language?

11:36.400 --> 11:40.560
 Right, so modes of communication

11:40.560 --> 11:43.300
 that people would define as language,

11:43.300 --> 11:46.200
 more in a very narrow definition,

11:46.200 --> 11:49.020
 they would say production of sound, so speech.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.680
 But what about the hands, the gesturing with the hands?

11:51.680 --> 11:55.360
 What about a bird who is doing aerial displays in the air,

11:55.360 --> 11:59.680
 communicating information through body language, right?

11:59.680 --> 12:02.840
 Well, I'm gonna go back to the brain.

12:02.840 --> 12:07.840
 So what I think is going on is for spoken language,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.960
 we're using the speech pathway

12:09.960 --> 12:12.040
 in all the complex algorithms there.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.320
 Next to the brain regions that are controlling

12:14.320 --> 12:16.280
 spoken language are the brain regions

12:16.280 --> 12:19.400
 or the brain regions for gesturing with the hands.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.240
 And that hand parallel pathway

12:22.240 --> 12:25.400
 has also complex algorithms that we can utilize.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.560
 And some species are more advanced in these circuits,

12:28.560 --> 12:31.320
 whether it's sound or gesturing with hands,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.900
 and some are less advanced.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.300
 Now, we humans and a few others are the most advanced

12:37.300 --> 12:41.380
 for the speech sounds or the spoken language,

12:41.380 --> 12:45.320
 but a non-human primate can produce gesturing

12:45.320 --> 12:48.220
 in a more advanced form than they could produce sound.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.400
 I'm not sure I got that across clearly,

12:51.400 --> 12:54.960
 just to say that humans are the most advanced

12:54.960 --> 12:59.560
 at spoken language, but not necessarily as big a difference

12:59.560 --> 13:03.320
 at gestural language compared to some other species.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.520
 Very clear and very interesting

13:05.520 --> 13:08.440
 and immediately prompts the question,

13:08.440 --> 13:12.720
 have there been brain imaging or other sorts of studies

13:12.720 --> 13:17.560
 evaluating neural activity in the context of cultures

13:17.560 --> 13:19.260
 and languages, at least that I associate

13:19.260 --> 13:22.560
 with a lot of hand movement, like Italian versus,

13:22.560 --> 13:24.540
 I don't know, maybe you could give us some examples

13:24.540 --> 13:27.580
 of cultures where language is not associated

13:27.580 --> 13:29.540
 with as much overt hand movement.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.720
 Yes, so as you and I are talking here today

13:32.720 --> 13:35.040
 and people who are listening but can't see us,

13:35.040 --> 13:38.120
 we're actually gesturing with our hands as we talk

13:39.220 --> 13:42.460
 without knowing it or doing it unconsciously.

13:42.460 --> 13:45.040
 And if we were talking on a telephone,

13:45.040 --> 13:46.960
 I would have one hand here and I'd be gesturing

13:46.960 --> 13:50.420
 with the other hand without even you seeing me, right?

13:50.420 --> 13:52.520
 And so why is that?

13:52.520 --> 13:54.440
 Some have argued, and I would agree,

13:54.440 --> 13:56.160
 based upon what we've seen,

13:56.160 --> 13:58.720
 is that there's an evolutionary relationship

13:58.720 --> 14:00.880
 between the brain pathways that control

14:00.880 --> 14:03.380
 speech production and gesturing.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.960
 And the brain regions I mentioned

14:05.960 --> 14:07.440
 are directly adjacent to each other.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.480
 And why is that?

14:08.480 --> 14:11.120
 I think that the brain pathways that control speech

14:11.120 --> 14:13.160
 evolved out of the brain pathways

14:13.160 --> 14:16.120
 that control body movement, all right?

14:16.120 --> 14:21.120
 And that when you talk about Italian, French,

14:22.080 --> 14:25.680
 English, and so forth, each one of those languages

14:25.680 --> 14:29.160
 come with a learned set of gestures

14:29.160 --> 14:31.160
 that you can communicate with.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.160
 Now, how is that related to other animals?

14:33.160 --> 14:35.920
 Well, Coco, a gorilla, who was raised with humans

14:35.920 --> 14:40.920
 for 39 years or more, learned how to do gesture,

14:41.360 --> 14:44.120
 communication, learned how to sign language,

14:44.120 --> 14:45.620
 so to speak, right?

14:45.620 --> 14:48.040
 But Coco couldn't produce those sounds.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.360
 Coco could understand them as well

14:51.400 --> 14:56.180
 by seeing somebody sign or hearing somebody produce speech.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.800
 But Coco couldn't produce it with her voice.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.360
 And so what's going on there is that a number of species,

15:03.360 --> 15:05.080
 not all of them, a number of species

15:05.080 --> 15:07.160
 have motor pathways in the brain

15:07.160 --> 15:09.480
 where you can do learned gesturing,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.720
 rudimentary language if you wanted, say, with your limbs,

15:12.720 --> 15:14.840
 even if it's not as advanced as humans.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.800
 But they don't have this extra brain pathway for the sound.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.160
 So they can't gesture with their voice

15:21.160 --> 15:23.560
 in the way that they gesture with their hands.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.800
 I see.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.080
 One thing that I've wondered about for a very long time

15:27.080 --> 15:32.080
 is whether or not primitive emotions

15:32.080 --> 15:37.080
 and primitive sounds are the early substrate of language,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.840
 and whether or not there's a bridge that we can draw

15:39.840 --> 15:44.480
 between those in terms of just the basic respiration systems

15:44.480 --> 15:47.160
 associated with different extreme feelings.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.600
 Here's the way I'm imagining this might work.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.480
 When I smell something delicious,

15:53.480 --> 15:57.020
 I typically inhale more,

15:57.020 --> 16:00.280
 and I might say, mm, or something like that.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.040
 Whereas if I smell something putrid,

16:02.040 --> 16:04.240
 I typically turn away, I wince,

16:04.240 --> 16:07.900
 and I will exhale, or sort of kind of like turn away,

16:07.900 --> 16:10.040
 trying to not ingest those molecules

16:10.040 --> 16:11.840
 or inhale those molecules.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.920
 I could imagine that these are the basic

16:14.920 --> 16:18.980
 dark and light contrasts of the language system.

16:18.980 --> 16:19.820
 And as I say that,

16:19.820 --> 16:23.120
 I'm saying that from the orientation of a vision scientist

16:23.120 --> 16:26.120
 who thinks of all visual images built up

16:26.120 --> 16:29.160
 in a very basic way of a hierarchical model

16:29.160 --> 16:31.280
 of the ability to see dark and light.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.480
 So I could imagine this kind of primitive

16:33.480 --> 16:38.480
 to more sophisticated pyramid of sound to language.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.640
 Is this a crazy idea?

16:41.640 --> 16:45.520
 Do we have any evidence this is the way it works?

16:45.520 --> 16:47.120
 No, it's not a crazy idea.

16:47.120 --> 16:51.900
 And in fact, you hit upon one of the key distinctions

16:51.900 --> 16:54.520
 in the field of research that I had started out in,

16:54.520 --> 16:56.560
 which is vocal learning research.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.200
 So for vocal communication,

17:00.400 --> 17:03.720
 you have most vertebrate species vocalize,

17:03.720 --> 17:06.440
 but most of them are producing innate sounds

17:06.440 --> 17:10.280
 that they're born with producing.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.400
 That is babies crying, for example, or dogs barking.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.800
 And only a few species have learned vocal communication,

17:18.800 --> 17:20.480
 the ability to imitate sounds.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.520
 And that is what makes spoken language special.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.720
 When people think of what's special about language,

17:26.720 --> 17:29.320
 it's the learned vocalizations.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.200
 That is what's rare.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.840
 And so this distinction between innateness and learned

17:36.080 --> 17:38.440
 is more of a bigger dichotomy

17:38.440 --> 17:39.640
 when it comes to vocalizations

17:39.640 --> 17:42.880
 than for other behaviors in the animal kingdom.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.400
 And when you go in the brain, you see it there as well.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.560
 And so all the things you talked about,

17:49.560 --> 17:51.920
 the breathing, the grunting, and so forth,

17:51.920 --> 17:55.640
 a lot of that is handled by the brainstem circuits

17:55.640 --> 17:57.880
 right around the level of your neck and below,

17:58.960 --> 18:00.840
 like a reflex kind of thing.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.720
 So, or even some emotional aspects of your behavior

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
 in the hypothalamus and so forth.

18:06.720 --> 18:11.040
 But for a learned behavior, learning how to speak,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.840
 learning how to play the piano,

18:12.840 --> 18:15.600
 teaching a dog to learn how to do tricks

18:15.600 --> 18:18.160
 is using the forebrain circuits.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.760
 And what has happened is that there's a lot

18:20.760 --> 18:22.520
 of forebrain circuits that are controlling

18:22.520 --> 18:24.520
 learning how to move body parts in these species,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.360
 but not for the vocalizations.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.760
 But in humans and in parrots and some other species,

18:29.760 --> 18:33.320
 somehow we acquired circuits where the forebrain

18:33.320 --> 18:36.280
 has taken over the brainstem,

18:36.280 --> 18:39.200
 and now using that brainstem not only to produce

18:39.200 --> 18:41.360
 the innate behaviors or vocal behaviors,

18:41.360 --> 18:42.800
 but the learned ones as well.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.840
 Do we have any sense of when modern

18:46.840 --> 18:50.920
 or sophisticated language evolved?

18:50.920 --> 18:54.280
 Thinking back to the species that we evolved from

18:54.280 --> 18:56.640
 and even within Homo sapiens,

18:58.080 --> 18:59.520
 has there been an evolution of language?

18:59.520 --> 19:02.160
 Has there been a devolution of language?

19:02.160 --> 19:07.160
 Yeah, I would say, and to be able to answer that question,

19:08.920 --> 19:11.480
 it does come with the caveat that I think we humans

19:11.480 --> 19:15.040
 overrate ourselves when it compared to other species.

19:15.040 --> 19:19.200
 And so it makes even scientists go astray

19:19.200 --> 19:21.960
 in trying to hypothesize when you especially

19:21.960 --> 19:24.760
 don't find fossil evidence of language that easily

19:26.760 --> 19:30.480
 out there in terms of what happened in the past.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.800
 We, amongst the primates, which we humans belong to,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.200
 we are the only ones that have

19:37.200 --> 19:39.520
 this advanced vocal learning ability.

19:39.520 --> 19:44.520
 Now, when it was assumed that it was only Homo sapiens,

19:45.720 --> 19:49.720
 then you can go back in time now based upon genomic data,

19:49.720 --> 19:51.400
 not only of us living humans,

19:51.400 --> 19:55.120
 but of the fossils that have been found for Homo sapiens,

19:55.120 --> 19:59.000
 of Neanderthals, of Denisovan individuals,

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
 and discover that our ancestor, our human ancestors,

20:04.360 --> 20:08.720
 supposedly hybridized with these other hominid species

20:08.720 --> 20:11.680
 and it was assumed that these other hominid species

20:11.680 --> 20:13.560
 don't learn how to imitate sounds.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.160
 I don't know of any species today that's a vocal learner

20:18.160 --> 20:21.400
 that can have children with a non vocal learning species.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.160
 I don't see it, it doesn't mean it didn't exist.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.920
 And when we look at the genetic data

20:26.920 --> 20:31.000
 from these ancestral hominids that,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.560
 where we can look at genes that are involved

20:33.560 --> 20:35.560
 in learning vocal communication,

20:35.560 --> 20:39.000
 they have the same sequence as we humans do

20:39.000 --> 20:41.800
 for genes that function in speech circuits.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.320
 So I think Neanderthals had spoken language.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.960
 I'm not gonna say it's as advanced as what it is in humans,

20:46.960 --> 20:49.240
 I don't know, but I think it's been there

20:49.240 --> 20:53.200
 for at least between 500,000 to a million years

20:53.200 --> 20:56.480
 that our ancestors had this ability

20:56.480 --> 20:58.640
 and that we've been coming more and more advanced

20:58.640 --> 21:01.200
 with it culturally and possibly genetically,

21:02.480 --> 21:04.200
 but I think it's evolved so much

21:04.200 --> 21:06.000
 that I think it's evolved sometime

21:06.000 --> 21:08.320
 in the last 500,000 to a million years.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.160
 Incredible.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.920
 Maybe we could talk a little bit more

21:11.920 --> 21:14.480
 about the overlap between brain circuits

21:14.480 --> 21:17.440
 that control language and speech in humans

21:17.440 --> 21:18.680
 and other animals.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.240
 I was weaned in the neuroscience era

21:23.240 --> 21:27.600
 where bird song and the ability of birds

21:27.600 --> 21:31.000
 to learn their tutor song was and still is

21:31.000 --> 21:33.880
 a prominent field, subfield of neuroscience.

21:33.880 --> 21:37.520
 And then of course, neuroimaging of humans,

21:37.520 --> 21:39.520
 speaking and learning, et cetera.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.160
 And this notion of a critical period,

21:41.160 --> 21:44.400
 a time in which language is learned more easily

21:44.400 --> 21:46.200
 than it is later in life.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.800
 And the names of the different brain areas

21:48.800 --> 21:49.920
 were quite different.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.760
 One opens the textbooks, we hear Wernicke's and Broca's

21:53.760 --> 21:55.920
 for the humans and you look at the birds,

21:55.920 --> 21:57.720
 I remember, you know.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
 HPC.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.840
 Robust arch striatum area X.

22:00.840 --> 22:01.800
 That's right, yes.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.780
 Et cetera.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.600
 But for most of our listeners,

22:04.600 --> 22:07.000
 those names won't mean a whole lot.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.800
 But in terms of homologies between areas

22:11.800 --> 22:13.600
 in terms of function, what do we know?

22:13.600 --> 22:17.260
 And how similar or different are the brain areas

22:17.260 --> 22:19.120
 controlling speech and language in say,

22:19.120 --> 22:22.440
 a songbird and a young human child?

22:22.440 --> 22:23.600
 Yeah.

22:23.600 --> 22:27.520
 So going back to the 1950s and even a little earlier,

22:27.520 --> 22:30.360
 Peter Mahler and others who got involved

22:30.360 --> 22:34.120
 in neuroethology, the study of neurobiology

22:34.120 --> 22:36.340
 of behavior in a natural way, right?

22:37.480 --> 22:40.880
 You know, they start to find that behaviorally,

22:40.880 --> 22:43.600
 there are these species of birds like songbirds and parrots

22:43.600 --> 22:46.080
 and now we also know hummingbirds, just three of them

22:46.080 --> 22:48.080
 out of the 40 something bird groups out there

22:48.080 --> 22:51.460
 on the planet, orders, that they can imitate sounds

22:51.460 --> 22:52.720
 like we do.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.400
 And so that was the similarity.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.240
 In other words, they had this kind of behavior

22:56.240 --> 22:59.320
 that's more similar to us than chimpanzees have with us

22:59.320 --> 23:01.720
 or than chickens have with them, right?

23:01.720 --> 23:03.320
 They're close to relatives.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.680
 And then they discovered even more similarities,

23:05.680 --> 23:10.400
 these critical periods that if you remove a child,

23:10.400 --> 23:13.360
 this unfortunately happens where a child is feral

23:13.360 --> 23:15.660
 and is not raised with human and goes through

23:15.660 --> 23:18.040
 their puberty phase of growth,

23:18.040 --> 23:21.260
 it becomes hard for them to learn a language as an adult.

23:21.260 --> 23:24.080
 So there's this critical period where you learn best.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.420
 And even later on when you're in regular society,

23:26.420 --> 23:27.560
 it's hard to learn.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.520
 Well, the birds undergo the same thing.

23:30.520 --> 23:34.000
 And then it was discovered that if they become deaf,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.480
 we humans become deaf, our speech starts to deteriorate

23:37.480 --> 23:39.040
 without any kind of therapy.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
 If a non-human primate or let's say a chicken becomes deaf,

23:46.520 --> 23:50.400
 their vocalizations don't deteriorate, very little at least.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.920
 Well, this happens in the vocal learning birds.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.820
 So there were all these behavioral parallels

23:54.820 --> 23:56.560
 that came along in a package.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.960
 And then people looked into the brain.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.520
 Fernando Nadeva, my former PhD advisor,

24:01.520 --> 24:05.320
 and began to discover the area X you talked about,

24:05.320 --> 24:07.900
 the robust nucleus of the archipelium.

24:07.900 --> 24:12.000
 And these brain pathways were not found

24:12.000 --> 24:13.360
 in the species who couldn't imitate.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.000
 So there was a parallel here.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.440
 And then jumping many years later,

24:18.440 --> 24:21.400
 I started to dig down into these brain circuits

24:21.400 --> 24:23.800
 to discover that these brain circuits

24:23.800 --> 24:26.800
 have parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans,

24:26.800 --> 24:28.240
 even though they're by a different name

24:28.240 --> 24:30.880
 like Broca's and laryngomotor cortex.

24:30.880 --> 24:34.400
 And most recently, we discovered not only the actual

24:34.400 --> 24:36.500
 circuitry and the connectivity are similar,

24:36.500 --> 24:39.160
 but the underlying genes that are expressed

24:39.160 --> 24:41.840
 in these brain regions in a specialized way,

24:41.840 --> 24:44.440
 different from the rest of the brain are also similar

24:44.440 --> 24:46.820
 between humans and songbirds and parrots.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.160
 So all the way down to the genes,

24:48.160 --> 24:51.280
 and now we're finding the specific mutations

24:51.280 --> 24:54.880
 are also similar, not always identical, but similar,

24:54.880 --> 24:57.040
 which indicates remarkable convergence

24:57.040 --> 25:00.020
 for so-called complex behavior in species

25:00.020 --> 25:02.880
 separated by 300 million years from the common ancestor.

25:02.880 --> 25:07.400
 And not only that, we are discovering that mutations

25:07.400 --> 25:10.780
 in these genes that cause speech deficits in humans,

25:10.780 --> 25:15.200
 like in FOXP2, if you put those same mutations

25:15.200 --> 25:18.040
 or similar type of deficits in these vocal learning birds,

25:18.040 --> 25:19.760
 you get similar deficits.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.800
 So convergence of the behavior is associated

25:22.800 --> 25:25.640
 with similar genetic disorders of the behavior.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.920
 Incredible.

25:26.920 --> 25:31.040
 I have to ask, do hummingbirds sing or do they hum?

25:31.040 --> 25:32.960
 Hummingbirds hum with their wings

25:32.960 --> 25:34.800
 and sing with their syrinx.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.160
 In a coordinated way?

25:36.160 --> 25:37.580
 In a coordinated way.

25:37.580 --> 25:42.160
 There's some species of hummingbirds that actually will,

25:43.120 --> 25:47.000
 Doug Ashford showed this, that will flap their wings

25:47.000 --> 25:50.020
 and create a slapping sound with their wings

25:50.020 --> 25:52.320
 that's in unison with their song.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.240
 And you would not know it,

25:54.240 --> 25:57.560
 but it sounds like a particular syllable in their songs,

25:58.620 --> 26:00.360
 even though it's their wings

26:00.360 --> 26:02.120
 and their voice at the same time.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.520
 Hummingbirds are clapping to their song.

26:04.520 --> 26:08.280
 Clapping, they're snapping their wings together

26:08.280 --> 26:10.900
 in unison with a song to make it like,

26:10.900 --> 26:14.080
 if I'm going, ba da da da da da, ba da,

26:14.080 --> 26:15.800
 you know, and I banged on the table.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.120
 Except they make it almost sound like their voice

26:18.120 --> 26:19.060
 with their wings.

26:20.220 --> 26:21.060
 Incredible.

26:21.060 --> 26:21.880
 Yes.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.720
 I'm-

26:22.720 --> 26:23.560
 And they got some of the smallest-

26:23.560 --> 26:26.200
 I guess as the kids would say, mind blown, right?

26:26.200 --> 26:27.020
 Incredible.

26:27.020 --> 26:27.860
 Yes.

26:27.860 --> 26:28.760
 Incredible, I love hummingbirds.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.120
 And I always feel like it's such a special thing

26:31.120 --> 26:33.440
 to get a moment to see one because they move around so fast

26:33.440 --> 26:37.140
 and they flit away so fast in these ballistic trajectories

26:37.140 --> 26:40.720
 that when you get to see one stationary for a moment

26:40.720 --> 26:42.880
 or even just hovering there,

26:42.880 --> 26:44.400
 you feel like you're extracting so much

26:44.400 --> 26:47.160
 from their little microcosm of life.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.720
 But now I realize they're playing music essentially.

26:49.720 --> 26:50.560
 Right, exactly.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.040
 And what's amazing about hummingbirds

26:53.040 --> 26:56.360
 and we're gonna say vocal learning species in general

26:56.360 --> 26:58.240
 is that for whatever reason,

26:58.240 --> 27:01.880
 they seem to evolve multiple complex traits.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.880
 You know, this idea that the evolving language,

27:04.880 --> 27:06.860
 spoken language in particular,

27:06.860 --> 27:09.760
 comes along with a set of specializations.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.320
 Incredible.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.640
 When I was coming up in neuroscience,

27:13.640 --> 27:17.560
 I learned that, I think it was the work of Peter Marler,

27:17.560 --> 27:22.560
 that young birds learn, songbirds, learn their tutor's song

27:23.360 --> 27:26.320
 and learn it quite well,

27:26.320 --> 27:29.500
 but that they could learn the song of another tutor.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.160
 In other words, they could learn a different,

27:31.160 --> 27:32.880
 and for the listeners, I'm doing air quotes here,

27:32.880 --> 27:35.600
 a different language, a different bird song,

27:35.600 --> 27:37.600
 different than their own species song,

27:37.600 --> 27:39.660
 but never as well as they could learn

27:39.660 --> 27:44.440
 their own natural genetically linked song.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.280
 Yes.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.120
 Genetically linked, meaning that it would be like

27:47.120 --> 27:48.860
 me being raised in a different culture

27:48.860 --> 27:52.920
 and that I would learn the other language,

27:52.920 --> 27:55.720
 but not as well as I would have learned English.

27:55.720 --> 27:56.760
 This is the idea.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.600
 Yes.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.420
 Is that true?

27:58.420 --> 27:59.260
 That is true, yes.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.200
 And that's what I learned growing up as well

28:01.200 --> 28:04.520
 and talked to Peter Marler himself about before he passed.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.120
 Yeah, he used to call it

28:07.120 --> 28:09.520
 the innate predisposition to learn.

28:09.520 --> 28:13.920
 All right, so, which would be kind of the equivalent

28:13.920 --> 28:16.440
 in the linguistic community of universal grammar.

28:16.440 --> 28:21.240
 There is something genetically influencing

28:21.240 --> 28:25.520
 our vocal communication on top of what we learn culturally.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.640
 And so there is this balance between

28:27.640 --> 28:31.440
 the genetic control of speech or a song in these birds

28:31.440 --> 28:34.400
 and the learned cultural control.

28:34.400 --> 28:39.400
 And so, yes, if you were to take, you know,

28:39.800 --> 28:41.600
 I mean, in this case, we actually tried this

28:41.600 --> 28:42.960
 at Rockefeller later on,

28:42.960 --> 28:46.640
 take a zebra finch and raise it with a canary,

28:46.640 --> 28:49.080
 it would sing a song that was sort of like

28:49.080 --> 28:49.920
 a hybrid in between.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.920
 We call it a keninch, right?

28:51.920 --> 28:55.280
 And vice versa for the canary,

28:55.280 --> 28:56.840
 because there's something different about their

28:56.840 --> 29:00.560
 vocal musculature or the circuitry in the brain.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.640
 And with a zebra finch,

29:01.640 --> 29:03.760
 even with a closely related species,

29:03.760 --> 29:07.320
 if you would take a zebra finch, a young animal,

29:07.320 --> 29:08.840
 and in one cage next to it,

29:08.840 --> 29:12.120
 place its own species, adult male, right?

29:12.120 --> 29:15.480
 And in the other cage place a Bengalese finch next to it,

29:15.480 --> 29:17.680
 it would preferably learn the song

29:17.680 --> 29:20.400
 from its own species neighbor.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.160
 But if you remove its neighbor,

29:22.160 --> 29:24.920
 it would learn that Bengalese finch very well.

29:24.920 --> 29:25.760
 Fantastic.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.960
 So there's, it has something to do with also

29:27.960 --> 29:30.360
 the social bonding with your own species.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.600
 Incredible.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.080
 That raises a question that I based on something

29:34.080 --> 29:37.240
 I also heard, but I don't have any scientific

29:37.240 --> 29:38.960
 peer reviewed publication to point to,

29:38.960 --> 29:41.480
 which is this idea of pigeon, not the bird,

29:41.480 --> 29:45.760
 but this idea of when multiple cultures and languages

29:45.760 --> 29:47.680
 converge in a given geographic area,

29:47.680 --> 29:50.400
 that the children of all the different native languages

29:50.400 --> 29:53.240
 will come up with their own language.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.000
 I think this was in island culture,

29:55.000 --> 29:56.840
 maybe in Hawaii called pigeon,

29:56.840 --> 29:59.560
 which is sort of a hybrid of the various languages

29:59.560 --> 30:01.360
 that their parents speak at home.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.360
 And that they themselves speak.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.600
 And that somehow pigeon, again, not the bird,

30:06.600 --> 30:09.400
 but a language called pigeon for reasons I don't know,

30:10.440 --> 30:14.640
 harbors certain basic elements of all language.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.800
 Is that true?

30:15.800 --> 30:16.640
 Is that not true?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.400
 I haven't studied enough myself

30:19.400 --> 30:21.520
 in terms of pigeon specifically,

30:21.520 --> 30:24.160
 but in terms of cultural evolution of language

30:24.160 --> 30:27.560
 and hybridization between different cultures and so forth,

30:27.560 --> 30:30.560
 even amongst birds with different dialects.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.080
 And you bring them together.

30:33.760 --> 30:37.960
 What is going on here is cultural evolution

30:37.960 --> 30:41.160
 remarkably tracks genetic evolution.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.720
 So if you bring people from two separate populations

30:44.720 --> 30:47.360
 together that have been in their separate populations

30:47.360 --> 30:51.360
 evolutionarily at least for hundreds of generations.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.560
 So someone's speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.240
 And that child then is learning from both of them.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.680
 Yes, that child is gonna be able to pick up

31:00.680 --> 31:05.680
 and merge phonemes and words together

31:06.080 --> 31:08.560
 in a way that an adult wouldn't.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.720
 Because why they're experiencing both languages

31:11.720 --> 31:16.040
 at the same time during their critical period years

31:16.040 --> 31:19.760
 in a way that adults would not be able to experience.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.560
 And so you get a hybrid.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.600
 And the lowest common denominator

31:23.600 --> 31:25.360
 is gonna be what they share.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.800
 And so the phonemes that they've retained

31:27.800 --> 31:31.840
 in each of their languages is what's gonna be,

31:31.840 --> 31:33.600
 I imagine, used the most.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.200
 Interesting.

31:35.200 --> 31:40.120
 So we've got brain circuits in songbirds and in humans

31:40.120 --> 31:41.760
 that in many ways are similar,

31:41.760 --> 31:43.760
 perhaps not in their exact wiring

31:43.760 --> 31:45.920
 but in their basic contour of wiring.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.440
 And genes that are expressed in both sets of neural circuits

31:49.440 --> 31:53.240
 in very distinct species that are responsible

31:53.240 --> 31:56.840
 for these phenomenon we're calling speech and language.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.560
 What sorts of things are those genes controlling?

32:00.560 --> 32:02.520
 I could imagine they were controlling

32:02.520 --> 32:05.280
 the wiring of connections between brain areas,

32:05.280 --> 32:08.840
 essentially a map of a circuit,

32:08.840 --> 32:10.720
 basically like an engineer would design a circuit

32:10.720 --> 32:11.600
 for speech and language,

32:11.600 --> 32:14.800
 nature designed the circuit for speech and language.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.800
 But presumably other things too,

32:16.800 --> 32:21.800
 like the ability to connect motor patterns

32:22.440 --> 32:24.560
 within the throat of muscles within the throat

32:24.560 --> 32:26.000
 when the control of the tongue.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.760
 I mean, what are these genes doing?

32:27.760 --> 32:28.840
 You're pretty good.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.800
 Yeah, you've made some very good guesses there

32:30.800 --> 32:32.080
 that make sense.

32:33.240 --> 32:36.800
 So yes, one of the things that differ

32:36.800 --> 32:38.320
 in the speech pathways of us

32:38.320 --> 32:39.800
 and these song pathways of birds

32:39.800 --> 32:42.440
 is some of the connections are fundamentally different

32:42.440 --> 32:44.040
 than the surrounding circuits,

32:44.040 --> 32:47.920
 like a direct cortical connection

32:47.920 --> 32:50.280
 from the areas that control vocalizations in the cortex

32:50.280 --> 32:53.520
 to the motor neurons that control the larynx in humans

32:53.520 --> 32:54.920
 or the syrinx in birds.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.600
 And so we've actually made a prediction

32:57.600 --> 33:00.080
 that since some of these connections differ,

33:00.080 --> 33:03.640
 we're gonna find genes that control neural connectivity

33:03.640 --> 33:05.880
 and that specialize in that function, that differ.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.600
 And that's exactly what we found.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.520
 Genes that control what we call axon guidance

33:11.520 --> 33:12.880
 and form-instant connections.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.040
 And what was interesting,

33:14.040 --> 33:17.960
 it was sort of in the opposite direction that we expected.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.600
 That is, some of these genes,

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
 actually a number of them

33:21.600 --> 33:24.880
 that control neural connectivity were turned off

33:24.880 --> 33:26.000
 in the speech circuit.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.400
 And it didn't make sense to us at first

33:29.400 --> 33:31.760
 and so we started to realize the function of these genes

33:31.760 --> 33:34.520
 are to repel connections from forming.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.440
 So repulsive molecules.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.600
 And so when you turn them off,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.280
 they allow certain connections to form

33:40.280 --> 33:42.240
 that normally would have not formed.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.880
 So by turning it off,

33:43.880 --> 33:45.920
 you gotta gain a function for speech.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.720
 Other genes that surprised us

33:49.720 --> 33:54.040
 were genes involved in calcium buffering, neural protection,

33:54.040 --> 33:56.720
 like a parvalbumin or a heat shock protein.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.720
 So when your brain gets hot, these proteins turn on.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.320
 And we couldn't figure out for a long time

34:01.320 --> 34:03.000
 why is that the case?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.600
 And then the idea popped to me one day and said,

34:05.600 --> 34:08.120
 ah, when I heard the larynx

34:08.120 --> 34:11.720
 is the fastest firing muscles in the body, all right?

34:11.720 --> 34:13.840
 In order to vibrate sound

34:13.840 --> 34:16.720
 and modulate sound in the way we do,

34:16.720 --> 34:20.600
 you have to control, you have to move those muscles,

34:20.600 --> 34:23.120
 you know, three to four to five times faster

34:23.120 --> 34:25.480
 than just regular walking or running.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.920
 And so when you stick electrodes in the brain areas

34:29.920 --> 34:32.280
 that control larynx vocalizations in these birds

34:32.280 --> 34:34.480
 and I think in humans as well,

34:34.480 --> 34:36.920
 those neurons are firing at a higher rate

34:36.920 --> 34:38.760
 to control these muscles.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.960
 And so what is that gonna do?

34:40.960 --> 34:43.600
 You're gonna have lots of toxicity in those neurons

34:43.600 --> 34:45.440
 unless you upregulate molecules

34:45.440 --> 34:48.760
 that take out the extra load

34:48.760 --> 34:51.000
 that is needed to control the larynx.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.880
 And then finally, a third set of genes

34:52.880 --> 34:55.240
 that are specialized in these speed circuit

34:55.240 --> 34:56.920
 are involved in neuroplasticity.

34:57.880 --> 35:01.600
 Neuroplasticity meaning allowing the brain circuits

35:01.600 --> 35:05.520
 to be more flexible so you can learn better.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.800
 And why is that?

35:06.800 --> 35:09.240
 I think learning how to produce speech

35:09.240 --> 35:12.600
 is a more complex learning ability

35:12.600 --> 35:14.560
 than say learning how to walk

35:14.560 --> 35:18.400
 or learning how to do tricks and jumps and so forth

35:18.400 --> 35:19.720
 that dogs do.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.360
 Yeah, it's interesting as you say that

35:21.360 --> 35:24.640
 because I realized that many aspects of speech

35:24.640 --> 35:25.720
 are sort of reflexive.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.760
 I'm not thinking about each word I'm gonna say.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.080
 They just sort of roll out of my mouth.

35:29.080 --> 35:31.000
 Hopefully with some forethought,

35:31.000 --> 35:35.240
 we both know people that seem to think less,

35:35.240 --> 35:37.360
 fewer synapses between their brain and their mouth

35:37.360 --> 35:38.320
 than others, right?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.760
 A lot of examples out there.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.600
 And some people are very deliberate in their speech.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.440
 But nonetheless, much of speech has to be precise

35:46.440 --> 35:49.000
 and some of it less precise.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.320
 In terms of plasticity of speech,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.680
 and the ability to learn multiple languages,

35:53.680 --> 35:55.680
 but even just one language,

35:55.680 --> 35:57.880
 what's going on in the critical period,

35:57.880 --> 35:59.200
 the so-called critical period?

35:59.200 --> 36:02.960
 Why is it that, so my niece speaks Spanish,

36:02.960 --> 36:06.240
 she's Guatemalan, speaks Spanish and English incredibly well.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.160
 She's 14 years old.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.640
 I've struggled with Spanish my whole life.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.720
 My father's bilingual, my mother is not.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.000
 I've tried to learn Spanish as an adult.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.920
 It's really challenging.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.100
 I'm told that had I learned it when I was eight,

36:18.100 --> 36:19.200
 I would be better off.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.020
 That's right.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.680
 Or it would be installed within me.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.500
 So the first question is,

36:24.500 --> 36:26.360
 is it easier to learn multiple languages

36:26.360 --> 36:28.080
 without an accent early in life?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.260
 And if so, why?

36:29.260 --> 36:30.800
 And then the second question is,

36:30.800 --> 36:34.560
 if one can already speak more than one language

36:34.560 --> 36:36.640
 as a consequence of childhood learning,

36:36.640 --> 36:39.940
 is it easier to acquire new languages later on?

36:39.940 --> 36:42.800
 So the answer to both of those questions is yes.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.360
 In that, but to explain this,

36:47.360 --> 36:49.020
 I need to let you know,

36:49.020 --> 36:51.380
 actually the entire brain

36:51.380 --> 36:54.360
 is undergoing a critical period development,

36:54.360 --> 36:56.340
 not just the speech pathways.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.280
 And so it's easier to learn how to play a piano.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.120
 It's easier to learn how to ride a bike for the first time

37:02.120 --> 37:07.120
 and so forth as a young child than it is later in life.

37:07.220 --> 37:10.920
 What I mean easier in terms of when you start from,

37:10.920 --> 37:13.920
 you start from first principles of learning something.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.560
 So the very first time if you're gonna learn Chinese

37:16.560 --> 37:18.440
 as a child versus the very first time

37:18.440 --> 37:20.120
 you learn Chinese as an adult,

37:20.120 --> 37:22.900
 or learning to play piano as a child versus an adult.

37:24.360 --> 37:28.360
 But the speech pathways, or let's say speech behavior,

37:28.360 --> 37:32.720
 I think has a stronger critical period change to it

37:32.720 --> 37:34.320
 than other circuits.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.680
 And what's going on there in general?

37:39.600 --> 37:44.000
 Why do you need a critical period to make you more stable,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.200
 to make you more stubborn, so to speak?

37:47.200 --> 37:52.200
 The reason I believe is that the brain is not,

37:52.360 --> 37:55.600
 brain can only hold so much information.

37:55.600 --> 38:00.440
 And if you are undergoing rapid learning

38:00.440 --> 38:02.680
 to acquire new knowledge,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.800
 you also have to dump stuff,

38:05.800 --> 38:10.220
 put memory or information in the trash, like in a computer.

38:10.220 --> 38:13.000
 You only have so many gigabases of memory.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.280
 And so therefore, plus also for survival,

38:17.280 --> 38:19.640
 you don't wanna keep forgetting things.

38:19.640 --> 38:23.840
 And so the brain is designed, I believe,

38:23.840 --> 38:27.880
 to undergo this critical period and solidify the circuits

38:27.880 --> 38:29.400
 with what you learned as a child

38:29.400 --> 38:31.120
 and you use that for the rest of your life.

38:31.120 --> 38:36.000
 And we humans stay even more plastic in our brain functions

38:36.000 --> 38:38.480
 controlled by a gene called SR-GAP2.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.040
 We have an extra copy of it

38:40.040 --> 38:42.240
 that leaves our speech circuit in other brain regions

38:42.240 --> 38:44.520
 in a more immature state throughout life

38:44.520 --> 38:46.080
 compared to other animals.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.720
 So we're more immature.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.760
 We're still juvenile-like compared to other animals.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.600
 I knew it.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.880
 But we still go through the critical periods

38:52.880 --> 38:54.240
 like they all do.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.120
 And now the question you asked about

38:57.120 --> 39:01.720
 if you learn more languages as a child,

39:01.720 --> 39:03.480
 is it easier to learn as an adult?

39:03.480 --> 39:06.380
 And that's a common finding out there in the literature.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.140
 There are some that argue against it.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.800
 But for those that support it, the idea there is

39:10.800 --> 39:14.640
 that you are born with a set of innate sounds

39:14.640 --> 39:18.040
 you can produce of phonemes and you narrow that down

39:18.040 --> 39:20.400
 because not all languages use all of them.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.680
 And so you narrow down the ones you use

39:22.680 --> 39:26.140
 to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn

39:26.140 --> 39:29.320
 and you maintain those phonemes as an adult.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.640
 And here comes along another language

39:31.640 --> 39:34.440
 that's using those phonemes in different combinations

39:34.440 --> 39:36.240
 you're not used to.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.480
 And therefore, it's like starting from first principles.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.080
 But if you already have them

39:41.080 --> 39:43.240
 in multiple languages that you're using,

39:43.240 --> 39:45.080
 then it makes it easier to use them

39:45.080 --> 39:47.600
 in another third or fourth language.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.520
 I see.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.760
 Incredible.

39:49.760 --> 39:54.560
 So it's not like your brain has maintained greater plasticity

39:54.560 --> 39:57.440
 is your brain has maintained greater ability

39:57.440 --> 39:59.540
 to produce different sounds

39:59.540 --> 40:02.160
 that then allows you to learn another language faster.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.600
 Got it.

40:03.600 --> 40:08.020
 Are the hand gestures associated with sounds

40:08.020 --> 40:10.200
 or with meanings of words?

40:10.200 --> 40:11.920
 I think the hand gestures are associated

40:11.920 --> 40:14.480
 with both the sounds and the meaning.

40:14.480 --> 40:19.320
 When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right?

40:19.320 --> 40:22.840
 And you are making a loud screaming noise, right?

40:22.840 --> 40:25.120
 You may make hand gestures

40:25.120 --> 40:27.880
 that look like you're gonna beat the wall, right?

40:27.880 --> 40:31.440
 Because you're making loud sounds and loud gestures,

40:31.440 --> 40:32.680
 all right?

40:32.680 --> 40:35.900
 But if you wanna explain something like come over here,

40:35.900 --> 40:38.660
 what I just do now to you, for those who can't see me,

40:38.660 --> 40:41.880
 I swung my hand towards you and swung it here to me.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.480
 That has a meaning to it, to come here.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.800
 So just like with the voice,

40:46.800 --> 40:50.800
 the hand gestures are producing both qualities of sounds.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.880
 And for people that speak multiple languages,

40:55.880 --> 40:58.420
 especially those that learn those multiple languages

40:58.420 --> 40:59.760
 early in development,

40:59.760 --> 41:02.280
 do they switch their patterns of motor movements

41:02.280 --> 41:06.600
 according to, let's say, going from Italian to Arabic

41:06.600 --> 41:10.640
 or from Arabic to French in a way that matches

41:10.640 --> 41:13.960
 the precision of language that they're speaking?

41:13.960 --> 41:14.800
 You know what?

41:14.800 --> 41:17.120
 You just asked me a question I don't know the answer to.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.400
 I would imagine that would make sense

41:19.400 --> 41:24.020
 because of switching in terms of,

41:24.020 --> 41:25.920
 sometimes people might call this code switching,

41:25.920 --> 41:28.400
 even different dialects of the same language.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.560
 Could you do that with your gestures?

41:30.560 --> 41:34.320
 I imagine so, but I really don't know if that's true or not.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.880
 I certainly don't know from my own experience

41:35.880 --> 41:37.640
 because I only speak one language.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.880
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

41:41.880 --> 41:43.960
 I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,

41:43.960 --> 41:47.160
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.440
 Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,

41:49.440 --> 41:51.880
 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink

41:51.880 --> 41:54.940
 that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.680
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,

41:57.680 --> 42:00.100
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.720
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

42:01.720 --> 42:04.640
 and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day

42:04.640 --> 42:07.560
 is that it supplies total foundational coverage

42:07.560 --> 42:08.960
 of my vitamin mineral needs

42:08.960 --> 42:11.880
 and it supplies important nutrients that I need

42:11.880 --> 42:13.440
 to support my gut microbiome.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.180
 The gut microbiome, as many of you know,

42:15.180 --> 42:16.280
 supports the immune system.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.320
 It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,

42:18.320 --> 42:20.680
 which is vital for mood, for energy levels,

42:20.680 --> 42:23.020
 for regulating focus, and many other features

42:23.020 --> 42:24.500
 of our mental health and physical health

42:24.500 --> 42:27.000
 that impact our daily performance and high performance

42:27.000 --> 42:29.120
 in any endeavors we might be involved in.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.860
 to claim that special offer.

42:52.860 --> 42:57.560
 To go a little bit into the abstract, but not too far,

42:57.560 --> 42:59.440
 what about modes of speech and language

42:59.440 --> 43:03.040
 that seem to have a depth of emotionality and meaning,

43:03.040 --> 43:07.080
 but for which it departs from structured language?

43:07.080 --> 43:09.160
 Here's what I mean, poetry.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.160
 I think of musicians, like there are some Bob Dylan songs

43:13.160 --> 43:17.180
 that to me, I understand the individual words.

43:17.180 --> 43:20.240
 I like to think there's an emotion associated with it.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.960
 At least I experienced some sort of emotion

43:21.960 --> 43:25.660
 and I have a guess about what he was experiencing.

43:25.660 --> 43:29.480
 But if I were to just read it linearly without the music

43:29.480 --> 43:32.800
 and without him singing it or somebody singing it like him,

43:32.800 --> 43:33.840
 it wouldn't hold any meaning.

43:33.840 --> 43:37.200
 So in other words, words that seem to have meaning

43:37.200 --> 43:39.660
 but not associated with language,

43:39.660 --> 43:42.240
 but somehow tap into an emotionality.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.120
 Yep, absolutely.

43:44.120 --> 43:49.120
 So we call this difference semantic communication,

43:49.200 --> 43:52.600
 communication with meaning, and affective communication,

43:52.600 --> 43:56.200
 communication that has more of an emotional

43:56.200 --> 44:00.320
 feeling content to it, but not with the semantics.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.600
 And the two can be mixed up,

44:02.600 --> 44:05.720
 like with singing words that have meaning

44:05.720 --> 44:07.960
 but also have this affective emotional,

44:07.960 --> 44:12.040
 you just love the sound of the singer that you're hearing.

44:12.040 --> 44:17.040
 And initially, psychologists, scientists in general

44:18.800 --> 44:20.600
 thought that these were gonna be controlled

44:20.600 --> 44:23.080
 by different brain circuits.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.800
 And it is the case there are emotional brain centers

44:25.800 --> 44:29.760
 in the hypothalamus, in the cingulate cortex and so forth

44:29.760 --> 44:33.100
 that do give tone to the sounds.

44:33.100 --> 44:37.160
 But I believe based upon imaging work

44:37.160 --> 44:39.140
 and work we see in birds,

44:39.140 --> 44:42.740
 when birds are communicating semantic information

44:42.740 --> 44:45.680
 in their sounds, which is not too often but it happens,

44:45.680 --> 44:48.560
 versus affective communication,

44:48.560 --> 44:50.600
 sing because I'm trying to attract the mate,

44:50.600 --> 44:53.420
 my courtship song or defend my territory,

44:53.420 --> 44:54.720
 it's the same brain circuits.

44:54.720 --> 44:57.160
 It's the same speech-like or song circuits

44:57.160 --> 44:59.340
 are being used in different ways.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.280
 A friend of mine who's also a therapist said to me,

45:04.280 --> 45:07.960
 it's possible to say, I love you with intense hatred

45:07.960 --> 45:10.560
 and to say, I hate you with intense love.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.560
 And reminded me that it's possible to hear

45:12.560 --> 45:15.120
 both of those statements in either way.

45:15.120 --> 45:18.520
 So I guess it's not just limited to song

45:18.520 --> 45:23.520
 or poetry, it also, there's something about the intention

45:23.720 --> 45:27.280
 and the emotional context in which something's spoken

45:27.280 --> 45:29.080
 that it can heavily shape the way

45:29.080 --> 45:31.320
 that we interpret what we hear.

45:31.320 --> 45:35.440
 That's right, and I consider all of that actually meaning,

45:35.440 --> 45:37.580
 even though I defined it as,

45:37.580 --> 45:41.760
 as people commonly do semantic and affective communication,

45:41.760 --> 45:44.000
 affective communication to say I hate you

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
 but love, right, does have emotional meaning to it.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.760
 And so one's more like an object kind of meaning

45:53.760 --> 45:55.560
 or an abstract kind of meaning.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.600
 There's several other points here I think it's important

45:57.600 --> 46:00.460
 for those listening out there to hear,

46:00.460 --> 46:03.240
 is that when I say also this affective

46:03.240 --> 46:07.800
 and semantic communication being used

46:07.800 --> 46:08.860
 by similar brain circuits,

46:08.860 --> 46:11.320
 it also matters the side of the brain.

46:11.320 --> 46:16.320
 In birds and in humans, there's left right dominance

46:17.360 --> 46:21.520
 for learned communication, learned sound communication.

46:21.520 --> 46:25.680
 So the left in us humans is more dominant for speech.

46:25.680 --> 46:29.240
 But the right has a more balance for singing

46:29.240 --> 46:31.160
 or processing musical sounds

46:31.160 --> 46:32.840
 as opposed to processing speech.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.840
 Both get used for both reasons.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.600
 And so when people say your right brain

46:37.600 --> 46:40.080
 is your artistic brain and your left brain

46:40.080 --> 46:43.720
 is your thinking brain, this is what they're referring to.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.200
 And so that's another distinction.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.720
 The second thing that's useful to know

46:49.720 --> 46:53.300
 is that all vocal learning species use their learned sounds

46:53.300 --> 46:58.040
 for this emotional affective kind of communication.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.360
 But only a few of them like humans

47:00.360 --> 47:02.640
 and some parrots and dolphins use it

47:02.640 --> 47:06.640
 for the semantic kind of communication calling speech.

47:06.640 --> 47:11.320
 And that has led a number of people to hypothesize

47:11.320 --> 47:14.480
 that the evolution of spoken language of speech

47:14.480 --> 47:17.220
 evolved first for singing,

47:17.220 --> 47:21.400
 for this more like emotional kind of made attraction

47:21.400 --> 47:24.080
 like the Jennifer Lopez, the Ricky Martin kind of songs

47:24.080 --> 47:25.520
 and so forth.

47:25.520 --> 47:29.640
 And then later on, it became used for abstract communication

47:29.640 --> 47:31.200
 like we're doing now.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.240
 Interesting.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.720
 Well, that's a perfect segue for me

47:34.720 --> 47:38.400
 to be able to ask you about your background

47:38.400 --> 47:42.700
 and motor control, not only of the hands, but of the body.

47:42.700 --> 47:46.320
 So you have a number of important distinctions to your name,

47:46.320 --> 47:49.100
 but one of them is that you were a member

47:49.100 --> 47:52.560
 of the Alvin Ailey Dance School of Dance.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.040
 That's right.

47:54.040 --> 47:58.180
 So you're an accomplished and quite able dancer, right?

47:58.180 --> 48:00.880
 Tell us a little bit about your background

48:00.880 --> 48:03.120
 in the world of dance.

48:03.120 --> 48:07.480
 And how it informs your interest in neuroscience,

48:07.480 --> 48:10.560
 excuse me, and perhaps even how it relates specifically

48:10.560 --> 48:12.120
 to your work on speech and language.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.080
 Yes.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.520
 Well, it's interesting.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.320
 And then this kind of history even goes before my time.

48:17.320 --> 48:19.920
 So in my family, my mother and father's side,

48:19.920 --> 48:21.720
 they both went to the High School of Music and Art

48:21.720 --> 48:23.600
 here in New York City.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.220
 And particularly my mother's family,

48:25.220 --> 48:28.320
 going back multiple generations, they were singers.

48:28.320 --> 48:31.640
 And I even did my family genealogy and found out

48:31.640 --> 48:33.920
 not only we have some relationships

48:33.920 --> 48:35.480
 to some well-known singers,

48:35.480 --> 48:37.800
 distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,

48:37.800 --> 48:42.080
 but going back to the plantations in North Carolina

48:42.080 --> 48:45.840
 and so forth, my ancestors were singers in the church

48:45.840 --> 48:48.000
 for the towns and so forth.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.280
 And this somehow got passed on multiple generations

48:51.280 --> 48:52.120
 to my family.

48:52.120 --> 48:53.720
 And I thought I was gonna grow up

48:53.720 --> 48:55.440
 and be a famous singer, right?

48:55.440 --> 48:58.860
 And me and my brothers and sister formed a band

48:58.860 --> 49:01.160
 when we were kids and so forth.

49:01.160 --> 49:04.640
 And, but it turned out that I didn't inherit

49:04.640 --> 49:07.680
 the singing talents of some of my other family members,

49:07.680 --> 49:12.000
 even though it was okay, but not like my brother

49:12.000 --> 49:16.200
 or not like my mother or my aunts and my cousin Pudafe,

49:16.200 --> 49:19.040
 who's now a talented Native American singer.

49:19.040 --> 49:24.040
 And so that then influenced me to do other things.

49:24.040 --> 49:29.040
 And I started competing in dance contests.

49:29.040 --> 49:31.520
 Actually this is around the time of the Saturday Night Fever

49:31.520 --> 49:35.320
 and I was as a teenager and I started winning dance contests

49:35.320 --> 49:37.080
 and I thought, oh, I can dance.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.800
 And I auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts

49:39.800 --> 49:42.400
 and I got in here in New York City

49:42.400 --> 49:45.160
 and got into ballet dance and got in, right?

49:45.160 --> 49:47.840
 And thought if I learn ballet, I can learn everything else.

49:47.840 --> 49:50.000
 It was that idea, if you learn something classical,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.840
 it can teach you very little.

49:51.840 --> 49:54.280
 If you learn something classical, it can teach you

49:54.280 --> 49:56.000
 for everything else.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.640
 And I was, yeah, at Alvin Ailey Dance School,

49:58.640 --> 50:00.360
 Joffrey Ballet Dance School.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.840
 And at the end of my senior concert,

50:03.840 --> 50:06.680
 I had this opportunity to audition

50:06.680 --> 50:08.720
 for the Alvin Ailey Dance Company

50:08.720 --> 50:11.440
 and I had an opportunity to go to college.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.640
 And I also fell in love with another passion

50:13.640 --> 50:16.200
 that my father had, which was science.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.880
 And so I liked science in high school

50:18.880 --> 50:21.720
 and I found an overlap also between the arts

50:21.720 --> 50:23.120
 and the sciences.

50:23.120 --> 50:27.280
 Both required creativity, hard work, discipline,

50:27.280 --> 50:30.160
 new discovery, both weren't boring to me.

50:30.160 --> 50:34.280
 And the one decision I made at that senior dance concert

50:34.280 --> 50:37.200
 was talking to the Alvin Ailey recruiter

50:37.200 --> 50:39.800
 and thinking about it, I have to make a decision.

50:39.800 --> 50:43.200
 And I thought something my mother taught me,

50:43.200 --> 50:46.480
 because she was growing up in the 1960s cultural revolution,

50:46.480 --> 50:50.360
 do something that has a positive impact on society.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.040
 I thought I can do that better as a dancer

50:52.040 --> 50:53.640
 than a scientist.

50:53.640 --> 50:58.040
 So now jump, I get into college, undergraduate school,

50:58.040 --> 51:00.360
 I major in molecular biology and mathematics.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.360
 I decided I wanted to be a biologist,

51:02.360 --> 51:05.120
 got into graduate school, wanted to study the brain

51:05.120 --> 51:06.680
 at the Rockefeller University.

51:06.680 --> 51:09.040
 So I went from Hunter College to Rockefeller University.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.480
 And so now I got to the brain

51:11.480 --> 51:14.360
 and why did I choose the brain

51:14.360 --> 51:16.600
 is because it controls dancing.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.320
 But there wasn't anybody studying dancing.

51:20.320 --> 51:21.400
 I wanted to study the brain,

51:21.400 --> 51:25.120
 something that's really interesting and complex.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.600
 And I thought, ah, language is what it does.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.760
 You couldn't study that in mice,

51:28.760 --> 51:30.800
 you couldn't study in non-human primates,

51:30.800 --> 51:32.560
 but these birds do this wonderful thing

51:32.560 --> 51:34.880
 that Fernando Nadebaum was studying at Rockefeller.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.840
 And so that's what got me into the birds.

51:37.840 --> 51:42.840
 And then jumping now 15 years later,

51:44.320 --> 51:46.760
 yeah, that's right, even after I'm into

51:46.760 --> 51:49.880
 now having my own lab studying vocal learning

51:49.880 --> 51:52.600
 in these birds as a model for language in humans,

51:52.600 --> 51:57.600
 it turns out that Ani Patel and others

51:58.240 --> 52:02.600
 have discovered that only vocal learning species

52:02.600 --> 52:04.680
 can learn how to dance.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.520
 Is that right?

52:05.520 --> 52:07.520
 That's right, yes.

52:07.520 --> 52:10.040
 So I've seen these, I'm just scrolling through

52:10.040 --> 52:12.280
 the files here in my mind.

52:12.280 --> 52:14.040
 I think about every once in a while someone will,

52:14.040 --> 52:16.360
 I love parrots.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.880
 Every once in a while someone will send me

52:17.880 --> 52:20.200
 one of these little Instagram or Twitter videos

52:20.200 --> 52:22.600
 of a parrot doing what looks to me like dance.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.760
 Typically it's a cockatoo.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.920
 That's right, that's right.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.120
 Even foot stomping to the sound.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.640
 Famous one called snowball out there,

52:28.640 --> 52:31.440
 but there are many snowballs out there.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.800
 They're all, all the dancing birds are named snowball.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.040
 That's interesting tactic.

52:36.120 --> 52:40.160
 So only animals with language dance.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.800
 Yeah, vocal learning in particular,

52:41.800 --> 52:44.680
 the ability to imitate sounds, yes.

52:44.680 --> 52:45.520
 Incredible.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.320
 Yes, and this now is bringing my life full circle.

52:49.280 --> 52:54.280
 All right, and I, and so when that was discovered in 2009,

52:55.400 --> 52:59.520
 at that same time in my lab at Duke we discovered

52:59.520 --> 53:03.200
 that vocal learning brain pathways in songbirds

53:03.200 --> 53:06.280
 as well as in humans and in parrots, right,

53:06.280 --> 53:09.760
 like snowball, are embedded within circuits

53:09.760 --> 53:11.480
 that control learning how to move.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.400
 And that led us to a theory we called

53:14.400 --> 53:18.520
 the brain pathway or motor theory of vocal learning origin,

53:18.520 --> 53:21.600
 where the brain pathways for vocal learning and speech

53:21.600 --> 53:23.760
 evolve by a whole duplication

53:23.760 --> 53:25.240
 of the surrounding motor circuits

53:25.240 --> 53:27.920
 involving learning how to move.

53:27.920 --> 53:31.040
 Now, how does that explain dance, right?

53:31.040 --> 53:35.600
 Well, when snowball, the cockatoos are dancing,

53:35.600 --> 53:37.000
 they're using the brain regions

53:37.000 --> 53:38.800
 around their speech-like circuits

53:38.800 --> 53:41.120
 to do this dancing behavior.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.640
 And so what's going on there?

53:42.640 --> 53:46.200
 What we hypothesized and now like to test

53:46.200 --> 53:51.200
 is that when speech evolved in humans

53:51.680 --> 53:54.960
 and the equivalent behavior in parrots and songbirds,

53:54.960 --> 53:58.680
 it required a very tight integration

53:58.680 --> 54:01.600
 in the brain regions that can hear sound

54:01.600 --> 54:04.160
 with the brain regions that control your muscles

54:04.160 --> 54:06.960
 from moving your larynx and tongue and so forth

54:06.960 --> 54:08.760
 for producing sound.

54:08.760 --> 54:11.560
 And that tight auditory motor integration,

54:11.560 --> 54:15.960
 we argued then contaminated the surrounding brain regions.

54:15.960 --> 54:18.480
 And that contamination of the surrounding brain regions

54:18.480 --> 54:22.440
 now allows us humans in particular in parrots

54:22.440 --> 54:24.520
 to coordinate our muscle movements

54:24.520 --> 54:27.360
 of the rest of the body with sound

54:27.360 --> 54:30.360
 in the same way we do for speech sounds.

54:30.360 --> 54:33.240
 Well, so we're speaking with our bodies when we dance.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.080
 Incredible.

54:34.080 --> 54:37.080
 And I have to say that as poor as I am

54:37.080 --> 54:38.400
 at speaking multiple languages,

54:38.400 --> 54:41.000
 I'm even worse at dancing, so.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.920
 But I guarantee you're better than a monkey.

54:43.920 --> 54:45.600
 But not Snowball the Cockatoo.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.240
 Maybe not Snowball.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.560
 On YouTube, we have a video

54:48.560 --> 54:50.880
 where there's some scientists dancing with Snowball

54:50.880 --> 54:52.640
 and you'll see Snowball's doing better

54:52.640 --> 54:53.680
 than some of the scientists.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.200
 Okay, well, as long as I'm not the worst

54:55.200 --> 54:56.800
 of all scientists at dancing,

54:58.400 --> 55:00.200
 there's always neuroplasticity.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.800
 May it save me someday.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.200
 You said something incredible that I completely believe,

55:07.200 --> 55:10.320
 even though I have minimum to,

55:10.320 --> 55:12.720
 let's just say minimum dancing ability.

55:12.720 --> 55:14.640
 I can get by at a party or wedding

55:14.640 --> 55:16.280
 without complete embarrassment,

55:16.280 --> 55:18.920
 but I don't have any structured training.

55:20.040 --> 55:25.040
 So the body clearly can communicate with movement.

55:26.880 --> 55:29.680
 As a trained dancer and knowing other trained dancers,

55:30.840 --> 55:34.840
 I always think of dance and bodily movement

55:34.840 --> 55:36.600
 and communication through bodily movement

55:36.600 --> 55:38.640
 as a form of a wordlessness,

55:38.640 --> 55:40.240
 like a state of wordlessness.

55:40.240 --> 55:42.000
 In fact, the few times when I think

55:42.000 --> 55:45.840
 that maybe I'm actually dancing modestly well

55:45.840 --> 55:47.520
 for the context that I'm in,

55:47.520 --> 55:48.960
 where I see other people dancing

55:48.960 --> 55:51.400
 and they seem to just be very much in the movement,

55:51.400 --> 55:54.400
 it's almost like a state of non-language,

55:54.400 --> 55:55.720
 non-spoken language.

55:57.400 --> 55:59.640
 And yet what you're telling me

55:59.640 --> 56:02.720
 is that there's a direct bridge at some level

56:02.720 --> 56:05.680
 between the movement of the body and language.

56:05.680 --> 56:08.560
 So is there a language of the body

56:08.560 --> 56:12.040
 that is distinct from the language of speech?

56:12.040 --> 56:15.800
 And if so, or if not, how do those map onto one another?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.440
 What does that Venn diagram look like?

56:17.440 --> 56:21.360
 Yeah, yeah, so let me define first dance

56:21.360 --> 56:24.600
 in this context of vocal learning species.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.160
 This is the kind of dancing

56:26.160 --> 56:28.400
 that we are specialized in doing,

56:28.400 --> 56:31.400
 and the vocal learning species is specialized in doing,

56:31.400 --> 56:34.560
 is synchronizing body movements of muscles

56:34.560 --> 56:37.040
 to the rhythmic beat of music.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.560
 And for some reason, we like doing that.

56:39.560 --> 56:42.520
 We like synchronizing to sound

56:42.520 --> 56:45.400
 and doing it together as a group of people.

56:45.400 --> 56:49.120
 And that kind of communication amongst ourselves

56:49.120 --> 56:51.800
 is more like the effective kind of communication

56:51.800 --> 56:54.920
 I mentioned earlier, unlike the semantic kind.

56:54.920 --> 56:58.160
 So we humans are using our voices

56:58.160 --> 57:02.440
 more for the semantic abstract communication,

57:02.440 --> 57:04.480
 but we're using learned dance

57:04.480 --> 57:09.200
 for the effective emotional bonding kind of communication.

57:09.200 --> 57:11.120
 It doesn't mean we can't communicate

57:11.120 --> 57:13.640
 semantic information in dance, and we do it,

57:14.480 --> 57:16.640
 but it's not as popular.

57:16.640 --> 57:19.760
 Like a ballet in the Nutcracker,

57:19.760 --> 57:23.120
 it is popular where they are communicating,

57:23.960 --> 57:26.000
 the Arabian guy comes out,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.200
 which I was the Arabian guy in the ballet Nutcracker,

57:28.200 --> 57:29.400
 that's how I remember,

57:29.400 --> 57:32.200
 for the Westchester Ballet Company when I was a teenager.

57:32.200 --> 57:36.680
 We're trying to communicate meaning in our ballet dance

57:36.680 --> 57:39.680
 and it can go on with a whole story and so forth.

57:39.680 --> 57:43.040
 But people don't interpret that as clearly as speech.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.240
 They're seeing the ballet with semantic communication

57:46.240 --> 57:48.640
 with a lot of emotional content.

57:48.640 --> 57:50.360
 Whereas you go out to a club,

57:51.200 --> 57:55.240
 you're not communicating, okay, how are you feeling today?

57:55.240 --> 57:57.360
 Tell me about your day and so forth.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.000
 You're trying to synchronize with other people

58:00.000 --> 58:01.400
 in an effective way.

58:01.400 --> 58:06.400
 And I think that's because the dance brain circuit

58:06.960 --> 58:10.080
 inherited the more ancient part of the speech circuit,

58:10.080 --> 58:12.160
 which was for singing.

58:12.160 --> 58:16.200
 I always had the feeling that with certain forms of music,

58:16.200 --> 58:19.000
 in particular opera, but any kind of music

58:19.000 --> 58:23.320
 where there are some long notes sung,

58:23.320 --> 58:28.320
 that at some level there was a literal resonance

58:28.320 --> 58:31.160
 created between the singer and the listener.

58:31.160 --> 58:35.600
 That, or I think of like the deep voice of a Johnny Cash

58:35.600 --> 58:38.480
 or where at some level you can almost feel the voice

58:38.480 --> 58:40.040
 in your own body.

58:40.040 --> 58:45.040
 And in theory, that could be the vibration of the,

58:45.240 --> 58:46.600
 or the firing of the phrenic nerve

58:46.600 --> 58:48.800
 controlling the diaphragm for all I know.

58:48.800 --> 58:50.760
 Is there any evidence that there's a coordination

58:50.760 --> 58:53.080
 between performer and audience

58:53.080 --> 58:58.400
 at the level of mind and body?

59:00.400 --> 59:03.760
 I'm gonna say possibly yes.

59:03.760 --> 59:05.920
 And the reason why is because I just came back

59:05.920 --> 59:08.600
 from a conference on the neurobiology of dance.

59:10.120 --> 59:12.640
 Clearly I'm going to the wrong meetings.

59:12.640 --> 59:14.440
 Vision science can be so boring.

59:14.440 --> 59:15.280
 Yes.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.240
 Well, one of my colleagues, Tecumseh Fitch

59:17.240 --> 59:20.920
 and Jonathan Fritz, they organized a particular section

59:20.920 --> 59:23.400
 on this conference in Virginia.

59:23.400 --> 59:25.520
 And this is the first time I was in the room

59:25.520 --> 59:27.760
 with so many neuroscientists

59:27.760 --> 59:29.360
 studying the neurobiology of dance.

59:29.360 --> 59:32.200
 It's a new field now in the last five years.

59:32.200 --> 59:37.200
 And there was one lab where they were putting EEG electrodes

59:39.040 --> 59:42.400
 on the dancers, on two different dancers

59:42.400 --> 59:44.080
 partnering with each other,

59:44.080 --> 59:49.080
 as well as the audience seeing the dance.

59:49.080 --> 59:51.240
 And some argued, okay,

59:51.240 --> 59:52.840
 if you're listening to the music as well,

59:52.840 --> 59:53.680
 how are you responding?

59:53.680 --> 59:55.800
 Because you're asking a question about music

59:55.800 --> 59:58.120
 and I'm giving you an answer about dance.

59:58.120 --> 1:00:02.360
 And what they found is that the dancers,

1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:04.720
 when they resonated with each other during the dance

1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:07.840
 or the audience listening to the dancers and the music,

1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:09.760
 there's some resonance going on there

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:13.160
 that they score as higher resonance.

1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:16.520
 Their brain activity with these wireless EEG signals

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:18.240
 are showing something different.

1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:19.960
 And so that's why I say possible yet.

1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:23.240
 It needs more rigorous study.

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:25.760
 And this is some stuff they publish,

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:27.480
 but it's not prime time yet,

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:29.440
 but they're trying to figure this out.

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:30.280
 I love it.

1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:32.360
 So at least if I can't dance well,

1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:35.200
 maybe I can hear and feel what it is

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:36.680
 to dance in a certain way.

1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:37.720
 That's right.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.680
 And this will be, some people will think that they,

1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:43.800
 even songs that they hear

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:47.000
 and they can almost sing to themselves in their own head

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.640
 and they know what they want it to sound like.

1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:51.280
 And you know what it really sounds good,

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:52.640
 what it sounds like,

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:55.520
 but they can't get their voice to do it.

1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:58.360
 I'm raising, for those listening, I'm raising my hand.

1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:00.160
 No musical ability.

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:03.360
 Others in my household have tremendous musical ability

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:06.920
 with instruments and with voice, but not me.

1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:11.800
 And so this is one of my selfish goals

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:13.800
 of trying to find the genetics

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:18.200
 of why can some people sing really well and some not?

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:20.760
 Is there some genetic predisposition to that?

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.920
 And then can I modify my own muscles

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.480
 or brain circuits to sing better?

1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:26.080
 You're still after the sing.

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:27.040
 I guess this is what happens

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:30.800
 when siblings vary in proficiency

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:32.280
 is that that competitiveness

1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:34.840
 amongst brothers and sisters never goes away.

1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:35.680
 I've been trying to breathe

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:38.240
 as good as my brother, Mark and Victor,

1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:40.400
 for the rest of my entire life.

1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:41.480
 Watch out, Mark and Victor.

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:43.440
 He's coming for you with neuroscience

1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:45.000
 from the vacuum.

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.040
 Earlier, you said that you discovered that you could dance.

1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:51.360
 That caught my ear.

1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:52.960
 It sounds like you didn't actually have to,

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:54.880
 I'm not suggesting you didn't work hard at it,

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.560
 but that at the moment where you discovered it,

1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:00.280
 it just sort of was a skill that you had

1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:01.920
 that up until that point,

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:06.120
 you didn't target a life in the world of dance.

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.160
 But the fact that you, quote unquote,

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:10.160
 discovered that you could dance really well

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:11.920
 and then went to this incredible school of dance

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:16.400
 and did well tells me that perhaps there is an ability

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.760
 that was built up in childhood

1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:21.560
 and or that perhaps we do all have

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:24.920
 different genetic leanings for different motor functions.

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:25.920
 Yeah.

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:29.320
 Well, for me, both explanations could be possible.

1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:32.280
 For the first, I grew up in a family

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.520
 listening to Motown songs,

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:39.360
 dancing at parties and so forth, family parties,

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:41.560
 an African-American family, basically.

1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:46.560
 And so I grew up dancing from a young child,

1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:51.520
 but this discovery, you know,

1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:56.520
 maybe dancing even more so in terms of a talent,

1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:00.680
 the genetic component, if it really exists, I don't know.

1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:03.760
 You know, with my 23andMe results,

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:07.840
 it says I have the genetic substitutions

1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:11.480
 that are associated with high-intensity athletes

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:13.200
 and fast-twitch muscles.

1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:14.200
 And who knows?

1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:16.480
 Maybe that could have something to do with me

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:21.480
 being able to synchronize my body to rhythmic sounds.

1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.440
 Maybe, maybe better than some others.

1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:28.960
 It turns out that my genetics also show

1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:31.400
 that I have a genetic substitute

1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.720
 that makes it hard for me to sing on pitch.

1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:37.120
 And so that does correlate with my, you know,

1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:38.320
 even though I can sing on this pitch,

1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:41.680
 especially if I hear a piano or, you know, kind of playing it

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:44.760
 but, you know, maybe that's why my siblings, you know,

1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:47.120
 who didn't have that genetic predisposition

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:49.680
 in his 23andMe results, you know,

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:52.720
 could go along with the genetic component as well.

1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:56.280
 I'm imagining family gatherings with 23andMe data

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:58.400
 and intense arguments about it.

1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:01.320
 Innate and learned ability, fun.

1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:03.000
 Love to be an attendant.

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000
 I'm not inviting myself to your Thanksgiving dinner,

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.280
 by the way, but I suppose I am.

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:08.120
 You're welcome to.

1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:09.280
 Thank you.

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.520
 I'll bring my 23andMe data.

1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:14.680
 I'd love to chat a moment about facial expression

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:17.160
 because that's a form of motor pattern that, you know,

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:19.360
 I think for most people out there,

1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:22.360
 just think about smiling and frowning,

1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:24.480
 but there are of course, you know, thousands,

1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:28.640
 if not millions of micro expressions and things of that sort,

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:31.000
 many of which are subconscious.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.800
 And we're all familiar with the fact

1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:36.280
 that when what somebody says

1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:38.440
 doesn't match some specific feature

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.520
 of their facial expression, that it can call, you know,

1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:45.200
 that mismatch can cue our attention,

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:47.920
 especially among people that know each other very well.

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:50.440
 Like somebody will say, well, you said that,

1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:53.560
 but your right eye twitched to the, you know,

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:55.360
 a little bit in a way that tells me

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:57.680
 that you didn't really mean that, these kinds of things.

1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:01.800
 Or in the opposite example,

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:05.040
 when the emotionality and the content of our speech

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:07.200
 is matched to a facial expression,

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:11.200
 there's something that's just so wonderful about that

1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:13.520
 because it seems like everything's aligned.

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:16.240
 So how does the motor circuitry

1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:18.000
 that controls facial expression

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.960
 map onto the brain circuits that control language, speech,

1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:24.160
 and even bodily and hand movements?

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:26.080
 You ask a great question

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:29.120
 because we both know some colleagues like Winrich Freiwald

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:30.600
 at Rockefeller University,

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:33.760
 who study facial expression and the neurobiology behind it.

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:37.520
 And now we both share some students that were co-mentoring

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.320
 and talk about this same question that you brought up.

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:45.200
 And what I'm learning a lot is that non-human primates

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.720
 have a lot of diversity in their facial expression

1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:49.120
 like we humans do.

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:52.160
 And what we know about the neurobiology

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:55.600
 of brain regions controlling those muscles of the face

1:05:55.600 --> 1:05:58.240
 is that these non-human primates and some other species

1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:00.720
 that don't learn how to imitate vocalizations,

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:05.720
 they have strong connections from the cortical regions

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:09.320
 to the motor neurons that control facial expressions,

1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:12.400
 but absent connections or weak connections

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:14.720
 to the motor neurons that control the voice.

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:18.920
 So I think our diverse facial expression,

1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:21.000
 even though it's more diverse than these non-human primates,

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:25.640
 there was already a pre-existing diversity of communication,

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:28.040
 whether it's intentional or unconscious

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:31.360
 through facial expression in our ancestors.

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:35.760
 And on top of that, we humans now add the voice

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:38.080
 along with those facial expressions.

1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:39.720
 I see.

1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:42.760
 And in terms of language learning when we're kids,

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:45.200
 I mean, children fortunately are not told

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:47.000
 to fake their expressions or to smile

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:48.480
 when they say I'm happy.

1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:52.960
 So at some point, everybody learns for better or for worse

1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:57.240
 how to untangle these different components

1:06:57.240 --> 1:06:59.720
 of hand movement, body posture,

1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:02.080
 speech, and facial expression.

1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:05.680
 But in their best form, I would say,

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:07.440
 assuming that the best form is always,

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:10.040
 I guess there are instances where, for safety reasons,

1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:13.920
 one might need to feign some of these aspects of language.

1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:16.720
 But in most cases, when those are aligned,

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:19.040
 it seems like that could reflect

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:20.720
 that all the different circuitries

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.320
 are operating in parallel,

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:25.480
 but that the ability to misalign these

1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:29.920
 is also a powerful aspect to our maturation.

1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:31.840
 I even think of theater, for instance,

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:36.720
 where deliberate disentangling of these areas is important,

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:41.000
 but also we know when an actor, when it feels real,

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.520
 and when it looks like, when bad acting is oftentimes

1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.480
 when the facial expression or body posture

1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:48.760
 just doesn't quite match what we're hearing.

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:53.240
 So are these skills that people that learn and acquire

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.200
 according to adaptability and profession,

1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:57.840
 or do you think that all children

1:07:57.840 --> 1:07:59.320
 and all adults eventually learn

1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:02.440
 how to couple and uncouple these circuits a little bit?

1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:05.240
 Yeah, I think it's this similar argument

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.480
 I mentioned earlier about the innate

1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:09.680
 and the learned for the vocalizations.

1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:12.720
 And by the way, when I say we humans have facial expressions

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:14.640
 associated with our vocalizations

1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:17.040
 in a different way than primates, non-human primates,

1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:19.600
 it's the learned vocalizations I'm talking about.

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:23.680
 So there is a common view out there

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:26.440
 that facial expressions in non-human species,

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:30.240
 like non-human primates, or you can have them in birds too,

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:33.480
 are innate, all right?

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:36.240
 And so they're reflexive controlled.

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:37.080
 I don't believe that.

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:38.880
 I think there's some learned component to it,

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:41.880
 and I think we have more learning component to it as well,

1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:44.880
 but we also have an innate component.

1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:48.040
 And so if you try to put your hands behind your back

1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:49.920
 and hold your fists, or even just not,

1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:52.440
 and try to speak and try to communicate,

1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:53.760
 it's actually harder to do.

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.920
 You have to force yourself or put it by your side.

1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:58.360
 This comes naturally.

1:08:58.360 --> 1:08:59.880
 Facial expressions comes naturally

1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:01.880
 because there is an innate component.

1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:06.320
 And yes, you have to learn how to dissociate the two,

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:08.400
 communicate something angry with your hands

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:13.400
 or with your face, but politely with your voice.

1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:16.320
 It's very hard to separate at those two

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.320
 because there is that innate component

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:19.760
 that brings them together.

1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:22.400
 So it's like an email too.

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:25.680
 You're emailing and someone says something by email.

1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:29.440
 Someone can interpret that angrily or gently,

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:32.680
 and it becomes ambiguous.

1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:35.640
 The facial expressions get rid of that ambiguity.

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:37.040
 I'm so glad you brought that out

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.320
 because my next question was and is about written language.

1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:44.120
 The first question I'll ask is when you write,

1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:46.760
 either type or write things out by hand,

1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:51.760
 do you hear the content of what you want to write

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:54.480
 in your head, just you personally?

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:55.640
 Yes, I do.

1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:59.440
 Yeah, and I know that I do

1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:03.400
 because I was trying to figure out a debate about this issue

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:05.920
 and trying to resolve the debate

1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:09.000
 with my own self-experimentation on me.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.600
 I ask that because a quite well-known colleague of ours,

1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:14.560
 Carl Deisseroth at Stanford,

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:17.400
 who's been on this podcast and is of optogenetics fame

1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:19.120
 and psychiatry fame, et cetera.

1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:19.960
 I know him.

1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:21.480
 Yeah, he sends his regards.

1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:26.480
 And told me that his practice for writing

1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:32.280
 and for thinking involves a quite painful process

1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:36.200
 of forcing himself to sit completely still

1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:38.360
 and think in complete sentences,

1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:40.320
 to force thinking in complete sentences.

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:42.800
 And when he told me that, I decided to try this exercise

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:43.920
 and it's quite difficult.

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:45.400
 First of all, it's difficult for the reason

1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:48.360
 that you mentioned, which is that with many thoughts,

1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:49.440
 I want to look around

1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:52.120
 and I start to gesticulate with my hands.

1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:53.040
 So there it is again,

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:55.680
 the connection between language and hand movement,

1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:57.120
 even if one isn't speaking.

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.480
 And the other part that's challenging

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:05.160
 is I realized that while we write in complete sentences,

1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:08.200
 most of the time, we'll talk about how that's changing now

1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:10.160
 and texting, et cetera,

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:14.600
 that we don't often think in complete sentences

1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:18.760
 and specifically in simple declarative sentences,

1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.760
 that a lot of our thoughts would be,

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:23.320
 if they were written out onto a page,

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.320
 would look pretty much like passive language

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.360
 that a good copy editor or a good editor would say,

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:31.920
 oh, like we need to cross this out,

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:33.640
 make this simple and declarative.

1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:36.920
 So what I'm getting at here is what is the process

1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:41.920
 of going from a thought to language to written word?

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:46.920
 And I also wanted to touch on handwritten versus typed,

1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:49.680
 but thought to language to written word,

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:50.720
 what's going on there?

1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:53.080
 What do we know about the neural circuitry?

1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:55.480
 And I was gonna ask, why is it so hard?

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.760
 But now I want to ask, why is this even possible?

1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.600
 It seems like a very challenging

1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:02.240
 neural computational problem.

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:03.680
 Yeah, yeah.

1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:07.840
 And coming from the linguistic world

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:10.080
 and even just the regular neurobiology world,

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:11.600
 going back to something I said before

1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:14.560
 is about a separate language module in the brain.

1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:16.720
 There was this thought or hypothesis

1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:18.560
 that this language module

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:21.680
 has all these complex algorithms to them,

1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:24.480
 and they're signaling to the speech circuit,

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.440
 how to produce the sounds,

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:29.240
 the hand circuit, how to write them or gesture,

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:34.360
 the visual pathway on how to interpret them from reading,

1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:36.320
 and the auditory pathway for listening.

1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:39.920
 I don't think that's the case, all right?

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.160
 And that this thinking

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:43.880
 where there's this internal speech going on,

1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:45.600
 what I think is going on

1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.000
 is to explain what you're asking is about,

1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.480
 that I'm gonna take it from the perspective

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:51.680
 of reading something.

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:53.800
 You read something on a paper,

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.760
 the signal from the paper goes through your eyes,

1:12:56.760 --> 1:12:58.080
 it goes to the back of your brain

1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:01.480
 to your visual cortical regions eventually,

1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:04.080
 and then you now got to interpret that signal

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:07.120
 in your visual pathway of what you're reading.

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:09.280
 How are you gonna do that in terms of speech?

1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:12.720
 That visual signal then goes to your speech pathway

1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:15.760
 in the motor cortex in front here in Broca's area,

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:19.480
 and you silently speak what you read in your brain

1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:21.320
 without moving your muscles.

1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:24.080
 And sometimes, actually, if you put electrodes,

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:28.960
 EMG electrodes on your laryngeal muscles,

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:30.560
 even on birds, you can do this,

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:33.880
 you'll see activity there while reading

1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:36.400
 or trying to speak silently,

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:38.520
 even though no sound's coming out.

1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:43.520
 And so your speech pathway is now speaking

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.520
 what you're reading.

1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:47.560
 Now, to finish it off,

1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:49.800
 that signal is sent to your auditory pathway

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:53.280
 so you can hear what you're speaking in your own head.

1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:54.120
 That's incredible.

1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:56.120
 And this is why it's complicated,

1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:59.160
 because you're using like three different pathways,

1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:01.360
 the visual, the speaking motor one,

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:04.160
 and the auditory to read.

1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:06.880
 Oh, and then you gotta write, right?

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.680
 Okay, here comes the fourth one.

1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:11.480
 Now the hand area's next to your speech pathway

1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:13.280
 has gotta take that auditory signal

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:16.120
 or even the adjacent motor signals for speaking

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:19.320
 and translate it into a visual signal on paper.

1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.320
 So you're using at least four brain circuits,

1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:25.480
 which includes the speech production

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:28.400
 and the speech perception pathways to write.

1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:29.560
 Incredible.

1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:33.040
 And finally explains to me why,

1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:35.720
 so I was weaned teaching undergraduates,

1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:37.200
 graduate students, and medical students.

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:40.560
 And I've observed that when I'm teaching,

1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:42.000
 I have to stop speaking

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.280
 if I'm going to write something on the board.

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:46.960
 I just have to stop all speaking completely.

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:49.120
 It turns out this is an advantage to catch

1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:51.360
 because it allows me to catch my voice.

1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:53.880
 It allows me to slow down a bit,

1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:56.440
 breathe and inhale some oxygen and so on,

1:14:56.440 --> 1:14:57.680
 because I tend to speak quickly

1:14:57.680 --> 1:14:59.840
 if I'm not writing something out.

1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:02.040
 So there's a break in the circuitry for me,

1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:03.640
 or at least they are distinct enough

1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:06.480
 that I have to stop and then write something.

1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:10.360
 Yes, that does imply competing brain circuits

1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:13.880
 for your conscious attention.

1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:16.920
 We have colleagues up at Columbia Med

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.000
 who are known at least in our circles

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.560
 for voice dictating their papers,

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:23.600
 not writing them out,

1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:26.240
 but just speaking into a voice recorder.

1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:27.720
 I've written papers that way.

1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:31.440
 It doesn't feel quite as natural for me

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:32.880
 as writing things out,

1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:34.760
 but not because I can go quickly

1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:36.880
 from thought to language to typing.

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:38.240
 I type reasonably fast.

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:39.320
 I can touch type now.

1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:40.600
 I don't think I ever taught my,

1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:41.600
 I think I taught myself.

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.200
 I never took a touch typing course,

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:44.440
 but it just sort of happened now.

1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:47.360
 My motor system seems to know where the keys are

1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:51.320
 with enough accuracy that it works.

1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:56.280
 This is remarkable to me that any of us can do this,

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.320
 but when it comes to writing,

1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:02.960
 what I've found is that if my rate of thought

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:06.080
 and my rate of writing are aligned nicely,

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.040
 things go well.

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.400
 However, if I'm thinking much faster than I can write,

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.720
 that's a problem.

1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:15.160
 And certainly if I'm thinking more slowly

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:16.200
 than I want to write,

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:17.920
 that's also a problem.

1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:21.480
 And the solution for me has been to write with a pen.

1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:22.520
 I'm in love with these,

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.480
 and I have no relationship to the company,

1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:25.320
 at least not now,

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:27.840
 although if they want to work with us,

1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:29.840
 I love these Pilot V5, V7s,

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:33.600
 because not necessarily because of the ink or the feel,

1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:34.600
 although I like that as well,

1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:37.240
 but because of the rate that it allows me to write.

1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:38.560
 They write very well slowly

1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:40.480
 and they write very well quickly.

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:44.720
 And so I have this theory supported only

1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:48.240
 by my own ANIC data, no peer-reviewed study,

1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:53.240
 that writing by hand is fundamentally different

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:55.720
 than typing out information.

1:16:55.720 --> 1:17:00.720
 Is there any evidence that this motor pathway for writing

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:04.400
 is better or somehow different

1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:06.920
 than the motor pathway for typing?

1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:09.360
 Yeah, that's interesting.

1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:11.720
 And I don't know of any studies,

1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:13.480
 I have my own personal experience as well,

1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:16.200
 but trying to put this into the context,

1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:19.280
 if I had to design an experiment

1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:21.240
 to test the hypothesis here,

1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:23.680
 to explain your experience in mind,

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:28.680
 is that writing by hand, I would argue,

1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:33.760
 requires a different set of less skills with the fingers

1:17:33.800 --> 1:17:35.080
 than typing.

1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:37.720
 So you have to coordinate your fingers

1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:42.720
 more in opposite directions and so forth with typing,

1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:45.440
 but also writing by hand requires more arm movement.

1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:53.400
 And so therefore, I would argue that the difficulty there

1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:56.960
 could be in the types of muscles

1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:59.680
 and the fine motor control you need of those muscles

1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:02.040
 along with speaking in your brain at the same time.

1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:03.920
 So basically I'm coarse, I'm a brute,

1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:07.000
 and so it makes sense that a more primitive writing device

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:07.840
 would work.

1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:08.680
 That's right, yes.

1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:12.480
 But let me add to this in terms of the,

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:14.560
 in my own personal experience, right,

1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:19.560
 what I find is I can write something faster by hand

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.160
 for a short period of time compared to typing.

1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:28.360
 And that is because I think I run out of the energy

1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:32.400
 in my arm movements faster than I run out of muscle energy

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.040
 in my finger movements.

1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.120
 And I think it takes a longer time for us to write words

1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:43.400
 with our fingers because, and in terms of the speech.

1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:47.640
 So I think you're writing, whether it's by hand or typing,

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:51.280
 and your speech, it only will align very well

1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:54.120
 if you can type as fast as you can speak

1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.200
 or write as fast as you can speak in your head.

1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:57.040
 I love it.

1:18:57.040 --> 1:18:59.000
 So what you've done, if I understand correctly,

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.320
 is created a bridge between thought and writing,

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:04.320
 and that bridge is speech.

1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:07.400
 That bridge is speech, that's right, that's right.

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:08.720
 When you're writing something out,

1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:10.760
 you're speaking it to yourself.

1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:13.440
 And if you're speaking faster than you can type,

1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:14.440
 you got a problem.

1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:16.240
 Interesting.

1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:18.560
 I do a number of podcast episodes

1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:20.400
 that are not with guests, but solo episodes.

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:22.720
 And as listeners know, these are very long episodes,

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:24.600
 often two or more hours.

1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:27.600
 And we joke around the podcast studio

1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:30.560
 that I will get locked into a mode of speech

1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:34.320
 where some of it is more elaborative and anecdotal,

1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:38.480
 and then I'll punch out simple declarative sentences.

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:42.080
 I find it very hard to switch from one module to the next.

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:43.920
 The thing that I have done

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:47.400
 in order to make that transition more fluid

1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:49.920
 and prep for those podcast episodes

1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:53.440
 is actually to read the lyrics of songs

1:19:53.440 --> 1:19:55.720
 and to sing them in my head

1:19:55.720 --> 1:19:57.720
 as a way of warming up my vocal cords.

1:19:57.720 --> 1:20:00.440
 But luckily for those around me,

1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:03.720
 when I do that, I'm not actually singing out loud.

1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:08.160
 And so what you're telling me supports this idea

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:12.120
 that even when we are imagining singing

1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:16.480
 or writing in our mind, we are exercising our vocal cords.

1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:19.800
 You're actually getting little low potentials

1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:22.760
 of electrical currents reaching your muscles there,

1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:24.200
 which also means you're exercising

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:25.560
 your speech brain circuits too,

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:28.960
 without actually going with the flow of activity

1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:29.960
 in the muscles.

1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:30.800
 Incredible.

1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:31.640
 Yes.

1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:33.920
 And this idea of singing helps you as well.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.080
 Even with Parkinson's patients and so forth,

1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:39.040
 when they want to say something,

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:41.280
 singing or listening to music helps them move better.

1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:45.160
 And the idea there is that the brain circuits for singing,

1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:47.960
 or let's say the function of the brain circuits for speech

1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:51.480
 being used for singing first is the more ancestral trait.

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:54.280
 And that's why it's easier to do things with singing

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:56.240
 sometimes than it is with speaking.

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:57.080
 I love it.

1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:02.280
 Stutter is a particularly interesting case

1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:04.520
 and one that every once in a while,

1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:08.360
 I'll get questions about this from our audience.

1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:11.120
 Stutter is complicated in a number of ways,

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.560
 but culturally, in my understanding from these emails

1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:18.160
 that I receive is that stutter can often cause people

1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:22.000
 to hide and speak less because it can be embarrassing.

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.160
 And we are often not patient with stutter.

1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:27.560
 We also have the assumption that if somebody's stuttering,

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:28.600
 that their thinking is slow,

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:31.440
 but it turns out there are many examples historically

1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:33.160
 of people who could not speak well,

1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:35.400
 but who were brilliant thinkers.

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:37.920
 I don't know how well they could write,

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:40.400
 but they found other modes of communication.

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:44.040
 I realize that you're not a speech pathologist

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:48.240
 or therapist, but what is the current neurobiological

1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:51.920
 understanding of stutter and what's being developed

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.560
 in terms of treatments for stutter?

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:58.480
 Yeah, so we actually accidentally came across

1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:00.280
 stuttering in songbirds

1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:03.000
 and we've published several papers on this.

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.920
 So try to figure out the neurobiological basis.

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:08.400
 The first study we had was a brain area

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:11.640
 called the basal ganglia or the striatum part

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:14.880
 of the basal ganglia involved in coordinating movements,

1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:16.840
 learning how to make movements.

1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:21.840
 When it was damaged in a speech-like pathway in these birds,

1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:25.240
 what we found is that they started to stutter

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:27.160
 as the brain region recovered.

1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:31.880
 And unlike humans, they actually recovered

1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:33.760
 after three or four months.

1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:34.880
 And why is that the case?

1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:38.120
 Because bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:41.800
 in a way that human or mammal brains don't.

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:45.000
 And it was the new neurons that were coming in

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.880
 into the circuit, but not quite

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:51.440
 with the right proper activity was resulting

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:54.480
 in this stuttering in these birds.

1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:57.520
 And after it was repaired, not exactly the old song

1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:59.800
 came back after the repair,

1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:02.360
 but still it recovered a lot better.

1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:07.360
 And it's now known, they call this neurogenics stuttering

1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:10.480
 in humans, damage to the basal ganglia

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:13.280
 or some type of disruption to the basal ganglia

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:16.640
 at a young age also causes stuttering in humans.

1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:19.320
 And even those who are born with stuttering,

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.920
 it's often the basal ganglia that's disrupted

1:23:24.920 --> 1:23:26.480
 in some other brain circuit.

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:29.440
 And we think the speech part of the basal ganglia.

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:32.960
 Can adults who maintain a stutter from childhood

1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:34.400
 repair that stutter?

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:36.760
 They can repair it with a therapy,

1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:39.280
 with learning how to speak slower,

1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:41.960
 learning how to tap out a rhythm during such.

1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:43.720
 And yeah, I'm not a speech pathologist,

1:23:43.720 --> 1:23:45.600
 but I started reading this literature

1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:47.960
 and talking to others that, you know,

1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:50.440
 colleagues who actually study stuttering.

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:54.880
 So yes, there are ways to overcome the stuttering

1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.720
 through behavioral therapy.

1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:03.280
 And I think all of the tools out there

1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:07.760
 have something to do with sensory motor integration.

1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:11.320
 Controlling what you hear with what you output

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:15.920
 in a thoughtful controlled way helps reduce the stuttering.

1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:17.640
 There are a couple examples from real life

1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:18.600
 that I want to touch on.

1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:20.800
 And one is somewhat facetious,

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:25.800
 but now I realize is a serious neurobiological issue.

1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:28.640
 Serious meaning, I think, interesting,

1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:31.160
 which is that every once in a while

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.160
 I will have a conversation with somebody

1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:37.080
 who says the last word of the sentence along with me.

1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:39.880
 And it seems annoying in some instances,

1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:42.920
 but I'm guessing this is just a breakthrough

1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:43.880
 of the motor pattern

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:46.320
 that they're hearing what I'm saying very well.

1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:47.800
 So I'm going to interpret this kindly

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.040
 and think they're hearing what I'm saying.

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:53.560
 They're literally hearing it in their mind

1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:56.520
 and they're getting that low level electrical activity

1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:57.400
 to their throat.

1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:01.240
 And they're just joining me in the enunciation

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:04.680
 of what I'm saying, probably without realizing it.

1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:06.240
 Can we assume that that might be the case?

1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:08.320
 Well, I wouldn't be surprised.

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:10.800
 So the motor theory of speech perception

1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:12.080
 where this idea originally came,

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:15.440
 what you hear is going through your speech circuit

1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:18.280
 and then also activating those muscles slightly.

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:23.280
 So yes, so one might argue,

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.040
 okay, is that speech circuit now interpreting

1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:29.160
 what that person is speaking now you listening to me

1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:30.600
 and is going to finish it off

1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:33.520
 because it's already going through their brain

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:34.440
 and they can predict it.

1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:36.760
 That would be one theory.

1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:39.640
 I don't think the verdict out there is no, but that's one.

1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:44.640
 The other is synchronizing turn-taking in the conversation

1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:49.640
 where you're acknowledging that we understand each other

1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:51.880
 by finishing off what I say.

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.200
 And it's almost like a social bonding kind of thing.

1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:58.520
 The other could be, I want the person to shut out

1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:00.920
 so I can speak as well and take that turn.

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:05.920
 And each pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation.

1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.160
 And if you have somebody who's overtalkative

1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:10.520
 versus undertalkative or vice versa,

1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:13.360
 that rhythm can be lost in them finishing off

1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:14.840
 and going back and forth.

1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:18.840
 But I think having something to do with turn-taking as well

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.240
 makes a lot of sense.

1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:22.640
 I have a colleague at Stanford who says

1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:25.640
 that interruption is a sign of interest.

1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:27.160
 I'm not sure that everyone agrees.

1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:28.960
 I think it's highly contextual,

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.360
 but there is this form of a verbal nod

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:34.360
 of saying, or things of that sort.

1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.600
 And there are many of these,

1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:38.720
 and I'm often told by my audience

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:41.120
 that I'd interrupt my guests and things of that sort.

1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:43.440
 Oftentimes I'll just get caught in the natural flow

1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:44.840
 of the conversation.

1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:45.680
 But-

1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:48.000
 Well, I think we've had pretty good turn-taking here,

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:48.840
 I hope.

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:49.680
 That's so far, so good.

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:50.520
 I feel that way.

1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:51.360
 I'm glad you feel that way,

1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:53.280
 because especially in the context of a discussion

1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:55.640
 about language, this seems important.

1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:02.520
 Texting is a very, very interesting evolution of language,

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:07.840
 because what you've told us is that we have a thought,

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:10.400
 it's translated into one word,

1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:11.880
 translated into language.

1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:14.640
 It might not be complete sentences, but texting,

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:16.120
 I have to imagine this is the first time

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.960
 in human evolution where we've written with our thumbs.

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:21.560
 So I don't know, it seems more primitive to me

1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:23.040
 than typing with fingers around your hands,

1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:26.120
 but hey, who am I to judge the evolution of our species

1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.760
 in one direction or the other?

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:32.760
 But the shorthand, often grammatically deficient,

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:36.320
 incomplete sentence form of texting

1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:38.160
 is an incredible thing to see.

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:41.280
 Early in relationships, romantic relationships,

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:44.240
 people will often evaluate the other's text

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:47.080
 and their ability to use proper grammar

1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:48.480
 and spelling, et cetera.

1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:50.640
 This often quickly degrades,

1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:51.840
 and there's an acceptance

1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:54.320
 that we're just trying to communicate through shorthand.

1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:57.880
 Almost military-like shorthand,

1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:00.680
 but with internally consistent between people,

1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:02.920
 but there's no general consensus of what things mean.

1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:07.920
 But WTFs and OMGs and all sorts of things.

1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:11.360
 I wonder sometimes whether or not

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:14.800
 we are getting less proficient at speech

1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:17.160
 because we are not required

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:20.640
 to write and think in complete sentences.

1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:22.920
 I'm not being judgmental here.

1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:24.360
 I see this in my colleagues.

1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:25.960
 I see this in myself.

1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:28.980
 This is not a judgment of the younger generation.

1:28:28.980 --> 1:28:33.980
 I also know that slang has existed for decades,

1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:36.340
 if not hundreds of years,

1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:38.260
 but I also know that I don't speak the same way

1:28:38.260 --> 1:28:40.260
 that I did when I was a teenager

1:28:40.260 --> 1:28:42.340
 because I've suppressed a lot of that slang,

1:28:42.340 --> 1:28:45.300
 not because it's inappropriate or offensive,

1:28:45.300 --> 1:28:46.940
 although some of it was, frankly,

1:28:48.140 --> 1:28:50.540
 but because it's out of context.

1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:53.020
 So what do you think is happening to language?

1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:56.100
 Are we getting better at speaking, worse at speaking?

1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:58.980
 And what do you think the role of things like texting

1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:02.820
 and tweeting and shorthand communication, hashtagging,

1:29:02.820 --> 1:29:05.300
 what's that doing to the way that our brains work?

1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:09.700
 Yeah, I think that one, in terms of

1:29:11.540 --> 1:29:14.320
 measuring your level of sophistication and intelligence,

1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:16.220
 and you say OMG, right?

1:29:16.220 --> 1:29:19.100
 I think that also could be a cultural thing

1:29:19.100 --> 1:29:21.800
 that, ah, you belong to the next generation.

1:29:22.940 --> 1:29:23.900
 Or you're being cool.

1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:27.540
 If you're an older person using OMG and other things

1:29:27.540 --> 1:29:31.040
 that the younger generation would use.

1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:34.380
 But if I really think about it clearly,

1:29:36.340 --> 1:29:39.320
 texting actually has allowed

1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:43.340
 for more rapid communication amongst people.

1:29:43.340 --> 1:29:47.660
 I think without the invention of the phone before then,

1:29:47.660 --> 1:29:50.100
 or texting back and forth,

1:29:50.100 --> 1:29:53.380
 you had to wait days for a letter to show up.

1:29:53.380 --> 1:29:55.900
 You couldn't call somebody on the phone and talk as well,

1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:57.820
 you know, and so this rapid communication,

1:29:57.820 --> 1:29:59.380
 but in terms of the rapid communication

1:29:59.380 --> 1:30:00.600
 of writing in this case.

1:30:01.580 --> 1:30:06.540
 So I think actually, it's more like a use it or lose it

1:30:06.540 --> 1:30:10.140
 kind of a thing with the brain.

1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:13.620
 The more you use a particular brain region or circuit,

1:30:13.620 --> 1:30:16.320
 the more enhanced, it's like a muscle.

1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:19.120
 The more you exercise it, the more healthier it is,

1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:21.220
 the bigger it becomes and the more space it takes

1:30:21.220 --> 1:30:23.420
 and the more you lose something else.

1:30:23.420 --> 1:30:27.860
 So I think texting is not

1:30:27.860 --> 1:30:32.060
 decreasing the speech prowess

1:30:32.060 --> 1:30:34.260
 or the intellectual prowess of speech.

1:30:34.260 --> 1:30:38.080
 It's converting it and using it a lot in a different way.

1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:43.300
 In a way that may not be as rich in regular writing

1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:47.580
 because you can only communicate so much nuance

1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:49.660
 in short term writing.

1:30:49.660 --> 1:30:53.220
 But whatever is being done,

1:30:53.220 --> 1:30:55.700
 you got people texting hours and hours and hours

1:30:55.700 --> 1:30:56.600
 on the phone.

1:30:56.600 --> 1:30:58.980
 So whatever your thumb circuit

1:30:58.980 --> 1:31:01.060
 is gonna get pretty big actually.

1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:04.340
 I do wonder whether, you know,

1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:07.060
 many people have lost their jobs based on tweets.

1:31:08.140 --> 1:31:11.580
 The short latency between thought and action

1:31:11.580 --> 1:31:15.940
 and distribution of one's thoughts is incredible.

1:31:15.940 --> 1:31:18.660
 And I'm not just talking about people

1:31:18.660 --> 1:31:23.660
 who apparently would have poor prefrontal top-down control.

1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:25.300
 This is geek speak, by the way,

1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:27.380
 for people that lack impulse control.

1:31:27.380 --> 1:31:28.900
 But high-level academics,

1:31:28.900 --> 1:31:30.540
 I'm not gonna point fingers at anyone,

1:31:30.540 --> 1:31:33.380
 but examples of where you see these tweets

1:31:33.380 --> 1:31:35.900
 and you go, what were they thinking?

1:31:35.900 --> 1:31:39.860
 So presumably there's an optimal strategy

1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:44.420
 between the thought, speech, motor pathway,

1:31:44.420 --> 1:31:47.380
 especially when the motor pathway engages communication

1:31:47.380 --> 1:31:49.260
 with hundreds of thousands of people.

1:31:49.260 --> 1:31:50.700
 And retweets in particular,

1:31:50.700 --> 1:31:53.300
 and the cut and paste function and the screenshot function

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:55.780
 are often the reason why speech propagates.

1:31:55.780 --> 1:31:56.620
 Yep.

1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:58.620
 So to me, it's a little eerie

1:31:58.620 --> 1:32:03.620
 that just that the neural circuitry can do this

1:32:04.420 --> 1:32:08.920
 and that we are catching up a little bit more slowly

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:10.220
 to the technology,

1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:13.900
 and you've got these casualties of that mismatch.

1:32:13.900 --> 1:32:17.900
 I think that's a good adjective to use,

1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:20.420
 the casualties of what's going on.

1:32:20.420 --> 1:32:23.380
 Because yes, it is the case with texting,

1:32:23.380 --> 1:32:25.540
 what you're really losing there

1:32:25.540 --> 1:32:28.380
 is less so the ability to write,

1:32:28.380 --> 1:32:32.060
 but more the ability to interpret what is being written.

1:32:32.060 --> 1:32:36.480
 And you can undeterpit something that somebody means.

1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:39.420
 On the flip side of that,

1:32:39.420 --> 1:32:42.520
 when if somebody's writing something very quick,

1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:46.120
 they could be writing instinctually,

1:32:46.120 --> 1:32:49.280
 more instinctually, their true meaning.

1:32:49.280 --> 1:32:53.400
 And they don't have time to modify and color code

1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:55.080
 what they're trying to say.

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:56.960
 And that's what they really feel

1:32:57.960 --> 1:33:00.240
 as opposed to say in a more nuanced way.

1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:05.080
 So I think both sides of that casualty are present.

1:33:05.080 --> 1:33:10.080
 And that's a downturn, an unintended negative consequence

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:14.720
 of short word communication.

1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:17.280
 Yeah, I agree that this whole phenomenon

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:20.480
 could be netting people that normally

1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:22.160
 would only say these things out loud

1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:25.760
 once inside the door of their own home or not at all.

1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:28.160
 It's an interesting time that we're in

1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:30.800
 vis-a-vis speech and language and motor patterns.

1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:32.760
 So part of the human evolution for language.

1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:35.200
 I think this is all part of our evolution.

1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:36.400
 That's right.

1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:38.120
 So for those of you thinking terrible thoughts,

1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:40.040
 please put them in the world and be a casualty.

1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:41.360
 And for those of you that are not,

1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:44.040
 please be very careful with how proficient

1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:47.760
 your thought to language to motor action goes.

1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.840
 Maybe the technology companies should install some buffers,

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.480
 some AI-based buffers.

1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:55.360
 Right, that's taking some EEG signals from your brain

1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:56.680
 while you're texting to say,

1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:00.840
 okay, this is not a great thought, slow down.

1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:03.840
 Right, this doesn't reflect your best state.

1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:07.080
 That brings me to what was going to be

1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:08.560
 the next question anyway, which is,

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:10.720
 we are quickly moving toward a time

1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:15.080
 where there will be an even faster transition

1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:18.440
 from thought to speech to motor output

1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:20.560
 and maybe won't require motor output.

1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:23.160
 What I'm referring to here is some of the incredible work

1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:25.360
 of our colleagues, Eddie Chang at UCSF

1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:29.400
 and others who are taking paralyzed human beings

1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:32.320
 and learning to translate the electrical signals

1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:33.640
 of neurons in various areas,

1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:35.360
 including speech and language areas

1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:37.280
 to computer screens that type out

1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:38.240
 what these people are thinking.

1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:39.360
 In other words, paralyzed people

1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:42.160
 can put their thoughts into writing.

1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:45.000
 That's a pretty extreme and wonderful example

1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:50.000
 of recovery of function that is sure to continue to evolve.

1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:52.640
 But I think we are headed toward a time

1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:55.960
 not too long from now where my thoughts

1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:58.360
 can be translated into words on a page

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:00.280
 if I allow that to happen.

1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:02.800
 Yeah, so, and Eddie Chang's work,

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.360
 which I admire quite a bit and cite in my papers,

1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:10.160
 I think he's really one of those at the leading edge

1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:13.480
 of trying to understand within humans

1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:15.600
 the neurobiology of speech.

1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.680
 And he may not say it directly,

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:19.000
 but I talked to him about this,

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:21.960
 it supports this idea that the speech circuit

1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:23.640
 in the separate language module,

1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:26.840
 I don't really think that there's a separation there.

1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:29.040
 So with that knowledge, yes,

1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:31.320
 in putting electrodes in the human brain

1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:33.400
 and then translating those electrical signals

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.400
 to speech currents, yeah,

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:38.240
 we can start to tell what is that person thinking.

1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:41.160
 Why, because we often think in terms of speech

1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.960
 and without saying words.

1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:46.640
 And that's a scary thought.

1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:49.760
 And now imagine if you can now translate those

1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:52.680
 into a signal that transmits something wirelessly

1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:55.640
 and someone from some distant part of the planet

1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:58.680
 is hearing your speech from a wireless signal

1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:00.560
 without you speaking.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.800
 So probably that won't be done in an ethical way,

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:07.080
 who knows, but I mean,

1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:10.280
 the ethics of doing that probably might not happen,

1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:12.440
 but who knows, we have these songbirds,

1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:15.000
 we apply the same technique to them,

1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:16.440
 we can start to hear what they're singing

1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:18.480
 in their dreams or whatever,

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:19.840
 even though they don't produce sound.

1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:22.360
 So we can find out by testing on them.

1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:24.840
 It's coming, one way or another, it's coming.

1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:28.200
 For those listening who are interested

1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:32.520
 in getting better at speaking and understanding languages,

1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:34.720
 are there any tools that you recommend?

1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:37.880
 And here again, I realize you're not a speech therapist,

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.760
 but here I'm not thinking about ameliorating

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:42.240
 any kind of speech deficiency.

1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:44.080
 I'm thinking, for instance,

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:48.600
 do you recommend that people read different types of writing?

1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:51.400
 Would you recommend that people learn how to dance

1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:54.360
 in order to become better at expressing themselves verbally?

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:59.360
 And feel free to have some degrees of freedom

1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:00.800
 in this answer.

1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:03.640
 These are obviously not peer-reviewed studies

1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:06.640
 that we're referring to, although there may be,

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:09.560
 but I'm struck by the number of things

1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:10.960
 that you do exceedingly well,

1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:15.600
 and I can't help but ask, well, the singing,

1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:17.200
 which I realize it may,

1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:18.400
 your brother didn't pay me to say this,

1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:20.920
 may not be quite as good as your brother's yet,

1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.400
 but you'll surpass him, I'm guessing,

1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:24.560
 at some point in getting that.

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:25.400
 Getting there.

1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:27.680
 Exactly, there you go.

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:31.760
 You know, should kids learn how to dance

1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:35.480
 and read hard books and simple books?

1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:36.320
 What do you recommend?

1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:37.600
 Should adults learn how to do that?

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.560
 Everyone wants to know how to keep their brain

1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:41.280
 working better, so to speak,

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:44.080
 but also I think people want to be able to speak well,

1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:46.200
 and people want to be able to understand well.

1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:50.120
 Yeah, so what I've discovered personally, right,

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:55.120
 is that, so when I switched from pursuing a career

1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:57.800
 in science from a career in dance,

1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:02.120
 I thought one day I would stop dancing,

1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:05.600
 but I haven't because I find it fulfilling for me,

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:08.680
 just as a life experience.

1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:11.600
 So ever since I started college,

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:14.880
 my late teens and early 20s,

1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:17.880
 I kept dancing even till this day,

1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:19.040
 and there have been periods of time

1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:20.560
 like during the pandemic,

1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:22.800
 where I slowed down on dancing and so forth.

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.760
 And when you do that, you realize,

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:27.360
 okay, there are parts of your body

1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:29.400
 where your muscle tone decreases a little bit

1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:32.200
 and somewhat, or you could start to gain weight.

1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:33.920
 I somehow don't gain weight that easily,

1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:35.440
 and I think it's related to my dance,

1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:38.520
 if that's meaningful to your audience.

1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:42.680
 But what I found is, in science,

1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:45.600
 we like to think of a separation between movement

1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:47.880
 and action and cognition.

1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:50.200
 And there is a separation between perception

1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:53.160
 and production, cognition being perception,

1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:55.440
 production being movement, right?

1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:59.400
 But if the speech pathways is next to the movement pathways,

1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:04.400
 what I discover is by dancing, it is helping me think.

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.800
 It is helping keeping my brain fresh.

1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:08.880
 It's not just moving my muscles.

1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:12.640
 I'm moving or using the circuitry in my brain

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:16.040
 to control a whole big body.

1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:18.440
 You need a lot of brain tissue to do that.

1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:23.280
 And so I argue, if you wanna stay cognitively intact

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:26.240
 into your old age, you better be moving.

1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:27.960
 And you better be doing it consistently,

1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:30.720
 whether it's dancing, walking, running,

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:35.520
 and also practicing speech, oratory speech and so forth,

1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:38.160
 or singing, is controlling the brain circuits

1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:40.080
 that are moving your facial musculature.

1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:44.200
 And it's gonna keep your cognitive circuits also in tune.

1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:48.000
 And I'm convinced of that from my own personal experience.

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.120
 For me, long, slow runs are a wonderful way

1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:56.320
 to kind of loosen the joints for long podcasts,

1:39:56.320 --> 1:39:57.680
 especially the solo podcasts,

1:39:57.680 --> 1:39:59.680
 which can take many hours to record.

1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:02.840
 And without those long, slow runs,

1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:05.400
 at least the day before or even the morning of,

1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:07.760
 I don't think I could do it, at least not as well.

1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:10.320
 All right, well, you're experiencing something similar.

1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:11.520
 So that's an N of two.

1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:13.360
 Yeah, N of two.

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:15.840
 I'm tempted to learn how to dance

1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:18.680
 because there are a lot of reasons to learn how to dance.

1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:21.160
 People can use their imagination.

1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:23.760
 I definitely wanna get the opportunity

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.000
 to talk about some of the newer work

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:31.000
 that you're into right now about genomes of animals.

1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:32.520
 As you perhaps can tell

1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:35.200
 from my quite authentic facial expressions,

1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:38.040
 I adore the animal kingdom.

1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:39.240
 I just find it amazing.

1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:42.000
 And it's the reason I went into neurobiology, in part.

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.400
 So many animals, so many different patterns of movement,

1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.400
 so many body plans, so many specializations.

1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:51.960
 What is the value of learning the genomes

1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:53.160
 of all these animals?

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.760
 I can think of conservation-based schemes

1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:02.080
 of trying to preserve these precious critters,

1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:04.160
 but what are you doing with the genomes of these animals?

1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:06.520
 What do you wanna understand about their brain circuits?

1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:08.400
 And how does this relate to some of the discussion

1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:10.120
 we've been having up until now?

1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:13.360
 I've gotten very heavily involved in genomes,

1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:17.040
 not just to get at an individual gene

1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:21.560
 involved in the trait of interest, like spoken language,

1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:25.840
 but I realize that nature has done

1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:27.560
 natural experiments for us.

1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:31.680
 With all these species out there with these various traits,

1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:33.920
 and the one that I'm studying, like vocal learning,

1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:36.560
 has evolved multiple times among the animal kingdom.

1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:39.600
 Even if it's rare, it's multiple times.

1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:44.600
 And the similar genetic changes occurred in those species.

1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:48.560
 But to find out what those genetic changes

1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:50.760
 that are associated with the trait of interest,

1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:53.560
 and not some other trait like flying in birds

1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:55.680
 as opposed to singing,

1:41:56.680 --> 1:41:59.040
 you have to do what's called comparative genomics,

1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:01.120
 even in the context of studying the brain.

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.360
 And you need their genomes to compare the genomes

1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:07.400
 and do like a GWAS, a genome-wide association study,

1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:09.440
 not just within a species like humans,

1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:10.760
 but across species.

1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:13.680
 And so you need good genomes to do that.

1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:16.400
 Plus, I've discovered I'm also interested

1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:18.040
 in evolution and origins.

1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:21.120
 How did these species come about a similar trait

1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:26.120
 in the last 300 million years or 60 million years,

1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:28.160
 depending on who you're talking about?

1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:31.080
 And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that.

1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:32.800
 And to get a good phylogenetic tree,

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:34.800
 you also need their genomes.

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:36.120
 And so because of this,

1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:38.800
 I got involved in large-scale consortiums

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:41.960
 and produced genomes of many different species,

1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:45.240
 including my vocal learners and their closest relatives

1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:46.520
 that I'm fans of.

1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:49.360
 But I couldn't convince the funding agencies

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:52.760
 to give me the money to do that just for my own project.

1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:55.480
 But when you get a whole bunch of people together

1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:57.160
 who wanna study various traits,

1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:03.120
 heart disease or loss and gain of flight and so forth,

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:07.000
 suddenly we all need lots of genomes to do this.

1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.600
 And so now that got me into a project

1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:12.600
 to lead something called the Vertebrate Genomes Project

1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:16.640
 to eventually sequence all 70,000 species on the planet.

1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:20.680
 And Earth Biogenome Project, all eukaryotic species,

1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:21.920
 all 2 million of them.

1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:26.720
 And to no longer be in a situation

1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:28.880
 where I wish I had this genome,

1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:32.200
 now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet,

1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:34.680
 create a database of all their traits

1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.920
 and find the genetic association with everything out there

1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:41.520
 that makes a difference from one species to another.

1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:47.360
 One more piece of the equation to add to this story

1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:50.840
 is what I didn't realize as a neuroscientist

1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:55.120
 were that these genomes are not only incomplete,

1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:58.200
 but they have lots of errors in them.

1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:01.760
 False gene duplications where mother and father chromosomes

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:03.880
 were so different from each other

1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:06.680
 that the genome algorithm, assembly algorithms,

1:44:06.680 --> 1:44:08.280
 treated them as two different genes

1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:10.480
 in this part of the chromosome.

1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:12.840
 So there are a lot of these false duplicated genes

1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:16.120
 that people were thought were real, but were not,

1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:18.400
 or missing parts of the genome

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:21.680
 because the enzymes used to sequence the DNA

1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:23.800
 couldn't get through this regulatory region

1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:28.440
 that folded up on itself and made it hard to sequence.

1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:31.680
 And so I end up in these consortiums

1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:35.200
 pulling in the genome sequencing companies

1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:38.360
 developing the technology to work with us

1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:39.680
 to improve it further.

1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:41.880
 And the computer science guys

1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:44.200
 who then take that data and that technology

1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:45.920
 and try to make the complete genomes

1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:47.920
 and make the algorithms better

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:51.520
 to produce what we now just did recently,

1:44:51.520 --> 1:44:53.400
 led by an effort by Adam Philippi,

1:44:53.400 --> 1:44:56.160
 is the first human telomere to telomere genome

1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:00.400
 with no errors, all complete, no missing sequence.

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:02.040
 And now we're trying to do the same thing

1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:04.440
 with vertebrates and other species.

1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:06.560
 Actually, we improved that before we got

1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:08.680
 to what we call telomere to telomere,

1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:10.840
 from one end of the chromosome to another.

1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:14.760
 And what we're discovering is in this dark matter

1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:17.280
 of the genome that was missing before,

1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:20.160
 turns out to be some regulatory regions

1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:22.920
 that are specialized in vocal learning species

1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:26.280
 and we think are involved in developing speech circuits.

1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.720
 Incredible, so much to learn and that we're going to learn

1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:32.120
 from this information.

1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:35.280
 Early on in these genome projects and connectome projects,

1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:37.040
 I confess I was a little bit cynical.

1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:38.560
 This would be about 10, 15 years ago.

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:42.640
 I thought, okay, necessary, but not sufficient for anything.

1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:44.600
 We need it, but it's not clear what's going to happen.

1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:46.240
 But you just gave a very clear example

1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:49.640
 of what we stand to learn from this kind of information.

1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:52.600
 And I know from the conservation side,

1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:53.800
 there's a huge interest in this

1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:55.440
 because even though we would prefer

1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:58.840
 to keep all these species alive rather than clone them,

1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:01.360
 these sorts of projects do offer the possibility

1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:04.560
 of potentially recreating species that were lost

1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.440
 due to our own ignorance or missteps or what have you.

1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:12.200
 Yes, and along those lines,

1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:16.160
 because we got involved in genomics,

1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:19.400
 some of the first species that we start working on

1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:21.560
 are critically endangered species.

1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:26.560
 And I'm doing that not only for perspectives

1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:27.560
 to understand their brains

1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:29.440
 and the genes involved in their brain function,

1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:31.880
 but I feel like it's a moral duty.

1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:34.640
 So the fact that now I've become more involved

1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:37.720
 in genome biology and have helped develop these tools

1:46:37.720 --> 1:46:39.080
 for more complete genomes,

1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:43.920
 let's capture their genetic code now before they're gone.

1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:48.000
 And could we use that information to resurrect the species

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.040
 at some future time, if not in my lifetime,

1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:54.880
 in some time in the future and generations ahead of us?

1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:59.600
 And so in anticipation of that,

1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:02.120
 we created a database we call the Genome Arc,

1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:06.000
 and no pun intended, like NOAA's arc,

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.400
 meant to store the genetic code

1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:10.920
 as complete genome assemblies as possible

1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:14.720
 for all species on the planet to be used for basic science,

1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:17.360
 but also some point in the future.

1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:19.440
 And because of that,

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:21.720
 funding agencies or private foundations

1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:23.480
 that are interested in conservation

1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:26.680
 have been reaching out to me now, a neuroscientist,

1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:30.400
 to help them out in producing high quality genome data

1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:32.440
 of endangered species that they can use,

1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:34.200
 like Revive and Restore,

1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:36.560
 who want to resurrect the passenger pigeon,

1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:39.800
 or Colossal, who wants to resurrect the wooly mammoth.

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:43.040
 And so we're producing high quality genomes for these groups

1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:44.720
 for their conservation projects.

1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:47.280
 What a terrific and important initiative.

1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:49.160
 And I think for those listening today,

1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:52.120
 they now certainly understand the value

1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:56.520
 of deeply understanding the brain structures

1:47:56.520 --> 1:47:58.440
 and genomes of different species,

1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:00.360
 because I confess,

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:02.840
 even though I knew a bit of the songbird literature,

1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:03.920
 and I certainly understand

1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:05.480
 that humans have speech and language,

1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:08.080
 I had no idea that there was so much convergence

1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:10.280
 of function, structure, and genomes.

1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:14.120
 And to me, I feel a lot more like an ape

1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:15.760
 than I do a songbird.

1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:18.560
 And yet here we are with the understanding

1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.440
 that there's a lot more similarity

1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:22.680
 between songbirds and humans

1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:24.360
 than I certainly ever thought before.

1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:27.400
 Yeah, something very close to home for us humans,

1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:31.160
 I can give you an example of, is evolution of skin color.

1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:35.160
 In skin color, we use it, unfortunately,

1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:37.200
 for racism and so forth.

1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:38.640
 We use it also for good things,

1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:41.360
 to let in more light or let out less light,

1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:43.720
 depending on the part of the planet

1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:45.360
 our population evolved in.

1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:47.640
 And most people think dark-skinned people

1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:50.080
 all evolved from the same dark-skinned person,

1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:51.280
 and light-skinned people

1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:52.840
 all evolved from the same light-skinned person,

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:54.520
 but that's not the case.

1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:57.520
 Dark skin and light skin amongst humans

1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:00.720
 has evolved independently multiple times,

1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:03.720
 like in the Pacific Islands versus Africa.

1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:07.160
 And it's just depending on the angle of light

1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:08.520
 hitting the Earth,

1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:10.720
 as to whether you need more protection from the sun

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.800
 or less protection,

1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:16.800
 that's also associated with vitamin D synthesis in the skin.

1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:20.440
 And so, and each time

1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:26.200
 where a darker or lighter skin evolved independently,

1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:27.600
 it hit the same gene.

1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:32.600
 You know, the melatonin receptors, that's right, yes, yeah.

1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:37.160
 Genes that are involved in melanin formation.

1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:41.080
 And so, those genes evolved some of the same mutations,

1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:42.680
 even in different species.

1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:44.360
 It's not just humans.

1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:48.280
 In equatorial regions, there are darker-skinned animals

1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:50.600
 than going away from the equator.

1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.240
 All right, I think of arctic foxes and things like that.

1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:53.240
 Yes, that's right, that's right.

1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:54.720
 Polar bears, you know.

1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:59.720
 And so, some of the same genes are used

1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:03.200
 in an evolutionary perspective to evolve in a similar way

1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:05.160
 within and across species.

1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:06.200
 Incredible.

1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:08.360
 And that's the same thing happening in the brain too.

1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:10.040
 Language is no exception.

1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:12.760
 Well, I have to say, as somebody who is a, you know,

1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:15.880
 career neuroscientist, but as I mentioned several times now,

1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:18.320
 who also adores the animal kingdom,

1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:22.240
 but is also obsessed with speech and language

1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:27.240
 and at a distance, not as a practitioner of music and dance,

1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:31.360
 this has been an incredible conversation

1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:33.480
 and opportunity for me to learn.

1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:35.600
 I know I speak for a tremendous number of people,

1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:37.400
 and I just really want to say thank you

1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:38.880
 for joining us today.

1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:40.080
 You are incredibly busy.

1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:42.600
 It's clear from your description of your science

1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:44.240
 and your knowledge base that you are involved

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:47.360
 in a huge number of things, very busy.

1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:50.320
 So thank you for taking the time to speak to all of us.

1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:52.120
 Thank you for the work that you're doing,

1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:53.680
 both on speech and language,

1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:55.800
 but also this important work on genomes

1:50:55.800 --> 1:51:00.760
 and conservation of endangered species and far more.

1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:03.400
 And I have to say, if you would agree to come back

1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:05.040
 and speak to us again sometime,

1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:06.560
 I'm certain that if we were to sit down

1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.240
 even six months or a year from now,

1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:09.400
 there's going to be a lot more to come.

1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:10.760
 Yeah, we have some things cooking.

1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:13.400
 And thank you for inviting me here

1:51:13.400 --> 1:51:15.400
 to get the word out to the community

1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:18.440
 of what's going on in the science world.

1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:20.680
 Well, we're honored and very grateful to you, Eric.

1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:21.520
 Thank you.

1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:22.400
 You're welcome.

1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:23.480
 Thank you for joining me today

1:51:23.480 --> 1:51:25.680
 for my discussion with Dr. Eric Jarvis.

1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:28.360

 spelled J-A-R-V-I-S, lab, all one word, jarvislab.net,

1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.120
 and there you can learn about all the various studies

1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:38.940
 taking place in his laboratory,

1:51:38.940 --> 1:51:41.080
 as well as some of the larger overarching themes

1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:42.720
 that are driving those studies,

1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:45.980
 including studies on human genomics and animal genomics

1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:47.680
 that surely are going to lead

1:51:47.680 --> 1:51:51.200
 to the next stage discoveries of how we learn

1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:53.920
 and think about and indeed use language.

1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:17.640
 And the newsletter comes out once a month

1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:19.160
 and it is completely zero cost.

1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:21.200
 Again, just go to HubermanLab.com

1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:23.660
 and go to the Neural Network newsletter.

1:53:23.660 --> 1:53:25.960
 I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:27.160
 has a clips channel.

1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:29.480
 So these are brief clips,

1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:31.520
 anywhere from three to 10 minutes

1:53:31.520 --> 1:53:33.420
 that encompass single concepts

1:53:33.420 --> 1:53:37.000
 and actionable protocols related to sleep, to focus,

1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:38.280
 interviews with various guests.

1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:39.640
 We talk about things like caffeine,

1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:42.760
 when to drink caffeine relative to sleep, alcohol,

1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:44.720
 when and how and if anyone should ingest it

1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:48.400
 relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health,

1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:50.000
 physical health, and on and on,

1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:51.960
 all the things that relate to the topics

1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:53.300
 most of interest to you.

1:53:53.300 --> 1:53:55.960
 You can find that easily by going to YouTube,

1:53:55.960 --> 1:53:58.880
 look for Huberman Lab clips in the search area,

1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:00.440
 and it will take you there, subscribe,

1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:02.780
 and we are constantly updating those with new clips.

1:54:02.780 --> 1:54:04.320
 This is especially useful, I believe,

1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:06.340
 for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes

1:54:06.340 --> 1:54:07.960
 or you're still working through the back catalog

1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:09.040
 of Huberman Lab Podcasts,

1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:11.160
 which admittedly can be rather long.

1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:13.460
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:54:13.460 --> 1:54:15.260
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:54:15.260 --> 1:54:33.760
 I'll see you in the next one.
