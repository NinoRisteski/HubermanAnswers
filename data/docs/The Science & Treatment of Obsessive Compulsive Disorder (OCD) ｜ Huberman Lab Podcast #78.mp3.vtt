00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.380
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.380 --> 00:13.100
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.100 --> 00:15.020
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.020 --> 00:18.080
 Today, we are talking about obsessive-compulsive disorder,

00:18.080 --> 00:19.540
 or OCD.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.820
 We are also going to talk about

00:20.820 --> 00:23.580
 obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,

00:23.580 --> 00:25.100
 which, as you will soon learn,

00:25.100 --> 00:28.060
 is distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.940
 In fact, many people that refer to themselves

00:29.940 --> 00:32.160
 or others as obsessive or compulsive,

00:32.160 --> 00:34.420
 or quote-unquote having OCD,

00:34.420 --> 00:37.220
 or OCD about this or OCD about that,

00:37.220 --> 00:40.380
 do not have clinically diagnosable OCD.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.980
 Rather, many people have obsessive-compulsive

00:42.980 --> 00:44.900
 personality disorder.

00:44.900 --> 00:47.460
 However, there are many people in the world

00:47.460 --> 00:49.980
 that have actual OCD.

00:49.980 --> 00:50.900
 And for those people,

00:50.900 --> 00:52.620
 there's a tremendous amount of suffering.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.940
 In fact, OCD turns out to be number seven

00:55.940 --> 00:58.660
 on the list of most debilitating illnesses,

00:58.660 --> 01:02.060
 not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses,

01:02.060 --> 01:05.180
 which is remarkable and somewhat frightening.

01:05.180 --> 01:06.360
 The good news is,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.740
 thanks to the fields of psychiatry,

01:08.740 --> 01:11.300
 psychology, and science in general,

01:11.300 --> 01:14.020
 there are now excellent treatments for OCD.

01:14.020 --> 01:16.420
 We're going to talk about those treatments today.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.940
 Those treatments range from behavioral therapies

01:18.940 --> 01:22.220
 to drug therapies and brain stimulation,

01:22.220 --> 01:25.860
 and even some of the more holistic or natural therapies.

01:25.860 --> 01:27.220
 As you'll soon learn,

01:27.220 --> 01:29.260
 for certain people, they may want to focus more

01:29.260 --> 01:30.860
 on the behavioral therapies,

01:30.860 --> 01:34.220
 whereas for others, more on the drug-based therapies,

01:34.220 --> 01:35.880
 and so on and so forth.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.620
 One extremely interesting and important thing

01:37.620 --> 01:39.100
 I learned from this episode

01:39.100 --> 01:40.980
 is that the particular sequence

01:40.980 --> 01:43.940
 that behavioral and or drug and or holistic therapies

01:43.940 --> 01:47.120
 are applied is extremely important.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.660
 In fact, the outcomes of studies

01:48.660 --> 01:50.180
 often depend on whether or not people

01:50.180 --> 01:51.940
 start on drug treatment and then follow

01:51.940 --> 01:54.760
 with cognitive behavioral treatment or vice versa.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.280
 We're going to go into all those details

01:56.280 --> 01:59.140
 and how they relate to different types of OCD,

01:59.140 --> 02:01.100
 because it turns out there are indeed different types

02:01.100 --> 02:02.920
 of obsessions and compulsions,

02:02.920 --> 02:07.060
 and the age of onset for OCD, and so on and so forth.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.300
 What I can assure you is by the end of this episode,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.140
 you'll have a much greater understanding

02:11.140 --> 02:13.660
 of what OCD is and what it isn't,

02:13.660 --> 02:16.720
 and what obsessive compulsive personality disorder is

02:16.720 --> 02:18.020
 and what it is not,

02:18.020 --> 02:21.700
 and you'll have a rich array of different therapy options

02:21.700 --> 02:24.960
 to explore in yourself or in others

02:24.960 --> 02:26.260
 that are suffering from OCD.

02:26.260 --> 02:29.420
 And if neither you or others that you know suffer from OCD

02:29.420 --> 02:31.940
 or obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

02:31.940 --> 02:34.060
 the information covered in today's episode

02:34.060 --> 02:36.720
 will also provide insight into how the brain

02:36.720 --> 02:39.900
 and nervous system translate thought into action generally.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.140
 And also you're going to learn a lot

02:42.140 --> 02:44.800
 about goal-directed behavior generally.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.300
 My hope is that by the end of the episode,

02:46.300 --> 02:48.940
 you will both understand a lot about this disease state

02:48.940 --> 02:50.400
 that we call OCD.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.660
 You will have access to information

02:52.660 --> 02:54.220
 that will allow you to direct treatments

02:54.220 --> 02:56.640
 to yourself or others in better ways,

02:56.640 --> 02:59.820
 and that you will gain greater insight into how you function

02:59.820 --> 03:02.100
 and how human beings function in general.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.040
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce

03:04.040 --> 03:06.300
 that we partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.580
 We've done that for several reasons.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.620
 First of all, the quality of their supplements

03:09.620 --> 03:11.180
 is exceedingly high.

03:11.180 --> 03:13.260
 Second of all, we wanted to have a location

03:13.260 --> 03:14.860
 where you could find all of the supplements

03:14.860 --> 03:16.540
 discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:16.540 --> 03:18.540
 in one easy to find place.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.500
 You can now find that place at livemomentous.com

03:21.500 --> 03:22.860
 slash Huberman.

03:22.860 --> 03:26.220
 In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,

03:26.220 --> 03:28.060
 something that a lot of other supplement companies

03:28.060 --> 03:29.340
 simply do not do.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.220
 So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US

03:31.220 --> 03:32.300
 or you live abroad.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.060
 Right now, not all of the supplements

03:34.060 --> 03:36.900
 that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,

03:36.900 --> 03:38.580
 but that catalog of supplements

03:38.580 --> 03:40.300
 is being expanded very rapidly.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.060
 And a good number of them that we've talked about,

03:42.060 --> 03:44.460
 some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus

03:44.460 --> 03:46.700
 and other aspects of mental and physical health

03:46.700 --> 03:47.540
 are already there.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.340
 Again, you can find them at livemomentous.com

03:49.340 --> 03:50.400
 slash Huberman.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.020
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

03:52.020 --> 03:53.260
 that this podcast is separate

03:53.260 --> 03:55.380
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.260
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:57.260 --> 03:59.740
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:59.740 --> 04:02.480
 and science related tools to the general public.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.500
 In keeping with that theme,

04:03.500 --> 04:06.380
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.420
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

04:08.420 --> 04:09.900
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:09.900 --> 04:11.620
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink

04:11.620 --> 04:14.600
 that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.340
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012

04:17.340 --> 04:18.660
 and I've taken it every day since.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.140
 So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:21.140 --> 04:22.840
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

04:22.840 --> 04:24.380
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

04:24.380 --> 04:25.620
 once or twice a day

04:25.620 --> 04:28.380
 is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.220
 In fact, when people ask me,

04:29.220 --> 04:31.060
 what's the one supplement I should take?

04:31.060 --> 04:32.660
 I always say Athletic Greens

04:32.660 --> 04:34.300
 because by taking Athletic Greens,

04:34.300 --> 04:35.940
 you give support to your immune system,

04:35.940 --> 04:38.160
 to your endocrine system, to your nervous system

04:38.160 --> 04:41.420
 and to the so-called gut brain axis and the gut microbiome.

04:41.420 --> 04:42.900
 As many of you probably heard,

04:42.900 --> 04:45.180
 our gut, meaning everywhere from our mouth

04:45.180 --> 04:46.640
 down all the way through our intestine

04:46.640 --> 04:49.340
 is populated by trillions of little micro bacteria

04:49.340 --> 04:52.520
 that support the different systems of our body.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.020
 Athletic Greens has the probiotics

04:54.020 --> 04:55.340
 that support the microbiome

04:55.340 --> 04:56.940
 and in turn support things like mood,

04:56.940 --> 04:59.740
 endocrine function, immune system and so on.

04:59.740 --> 05:01.060
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:01.060 --> 05:03.540
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:03.540 --> 05:04.820
 and claim their special offer.

05:04.820 --> 05:06.620
 They'll give you five free travel packs

05:06.620 --> 05:09.420
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.420
 Many people are deficient in vitamin D3

05:11.420 --> 05:13.420
 and in general, vitamin D3 and K2

05:13.420 --> 05:16.540
 support a huge number of factors in your brain and body

05:16.540 --> 05:18.620
 that support your immediate and long-term health.

05:18.620 --> 05:21.460
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:21.460 --> 05:22.940
 to claim their special offer.

05:22.940 --> 05:25.460
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.780
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.940
 And frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.380
 I've said that on various podcasts

05:32.380 --> 05:33.500
 and on social media posts.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.260
 And the reason I'm not a fan of the word nootropics

05:35.260 --> 05:37.060
 is it means smart drugs.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.680
 But as a neuroscientist,

05:38.680 --> 05:41.260
 I know that we don't have circuits in the brain

05:41.260 --> 05:43.380
 or chemicals in the brain for being smart.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.500
 We have circuits in the brain for focus

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
 and for task switching and for creativity.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.900
 And oftentimes those circuits differ from one another,

05:49.900 --> 05:51.600
 although they collaborate to create things

05:51.600 --> 05:53.820
 that we think of as intelligence or focus

05:53.820 --> 05:55.580
 or creativity, et cetera.

05:55.580 --> 05:56.940
 Thesis understands this,

05:56.940 --> 05:59.440
 and for that reason has developed custom nootropics

05:59.440 --> 06:01.340
 that are matched to your particular goals

06:01.340 --> 06:03.740
 and to your particular biology.

06:03.740 --> 06:04.860
 They give you the opportunity to try

06:04.860 --> 06:06.800
 several different blends over the course of a month

06:06.800 --> 06:08.520
 and discover which ones work best for you

06:08.520 --> 06:10.060
 and which ones don't.

06:10.060 --> 06:11.580
 In addition to that personalization,

06:11.580 --> 06:12.500
 they take it a step further

06:12.500 --> 06:14.860
 by offering free consultations with a coach

06:14.860 --> 06:16.380
 to help you optimize your experience

06:16.380 --> 06:18.780
 and dial in your perfect formulas.

06:18.780 --> 06:21.100
 I've been using Thesis for about eight months now,

06:21.100 --> 06:23.440
 and I can confidently say that their nootropics

06:23.440 --> 06:25.220
 are the best that I've ever used.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.520
 My go-to formula is the clarity formula

06:27.520 --> 06:28.780
 or the motivation formula

06:28.780 --> 06:30.540
 when I'm going to work or work out,

06:30.540 --> 06:32.660
 meaning I'm going to do focus cognitive work

06:32.660 --> 06:33.740
 or I'm going to exercise.

06:33.740 --> 06:36.420
 I also like their energy formula prior to exercise.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.420
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

06:38.420 --> 06:41.580
 go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.

06:41.580 --> 06:42.820
 You can take a three minute quiz

06:42.820 --> 06:45.580
 that will help match you to the best custom nootropics

06:45.580 --> 06:47.500
 to start with, and Thesis will send you

06:47.500 --> 06:49.820
 four different formulas to try in that first month.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.540
 Again, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman

06:52.540 --> 06:54.020
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

06:54.020 --> 06:56.720
 to get 10% off your first order.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.380
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

06:59.380 --> 07:01.180
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

07:01.180 --> 07:04.340
 that have cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.860
 I've talked many times on this podcast

07:05.860 --> 07:08.160
 and on other podcasts and on social media

07:08.160 --> 07:09.900
 about the critical relationship

07:09.900 --> 07:12.460
 between temperature and sleep.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.380
 Generally speaking, your body temperature

07:14.380 --> 07:16.260
 has to drop by about one to three degrees

07:16.260 --> 07:19.060
 in order to get into and to stay in deep sleep.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.540
 And waking up has a lot to do with an increase

07:21.540 --> 07:24.020
 in body temperature of about one to three degrees.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.980
 So for many people like myself who run warm

07:25.980 --> 07:27.420
 during the night, I find myself waking up

07:27.420 --> 07:28.460
 in the middle of the night.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.720
 However, recently I started using

07:29.720 --> 07:31.180
 an Eight Sleep mattress cover.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.180
 And by programming in the specific temperatures

07:33.180 --> 07:35.020
 that work for me across the night,

07:35.020 --> 07:36.660
 I'm staying asleep through the whole night.

07:36.660 --> 07:39.380
 And as a consequence, I'm feeling far better during the day,

07:39.380 --> 07:40.900
 much more focus, alertness, et cetera,

07:40.900 --> 07:42.220
 all the great things that come

07:42.220 --> 07:45.100
 from getting excellent sleep consistently.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.540
 The ProPod cover by Eight Sleep

07:46.540 --> 07:48.260
 is their most advanced solution on the market

07:48.260 --> 07:49.740
 for thermal regulation during sleep.

07:49.740 --> 07:50.980
 That's the one I use.

07:50.980 --> 07:52.420
 It pairs dynamic cooling and heating

07:52.420 --> 07:53.500
 with biometric tracking.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.040
 It also has this really nice feature

07:55.040 --> 07:57.620
 where your mattress basically vibrates a little bit

07:57.620 --> 07:58.500
 right upon waking.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.820
 I like that as well.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.220
 You can cover any mattress with it.

08:01.220 --> 08:03.820
 You can start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit

08:03.820 --> 08:05.820
 or as warm as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.300
 And that range is available to you

08:07.300 --> 08:09.060
 simply because Eight Sleep understands

08:09.060 --> 08:10.860
 that people have a tremendous range

08:10.860 --> 08:13.940
 in natural body temperatures and sleeping environments.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.020
 If you want to try Eight Sleep,

08:15.020 --> 08:17.140
 you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman

08:29.100 --> 08:32.700
 Let's talk about OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.820
 First of all, as the name suggests,

08:34.820 --> 08:37.660
 OCD includes thoughts or obsessions

08:37.660 --> 08:40.520
 and compulsions, which are actions.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.420
 The obsessions and the compulsions are often linked.

08:43.420 --> 08:44.760
 In fact, most of the time,

08:44.760 --> 08:46.680
 the obsessions and the compulsions are linked

08:46.680 --> 08:49.460
 such that the compulsion, the behavior,

08:49.460 --> 08:52.660
 is designed to relieve the obsession.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.540
 However, one of the hallmark themes

08:54.540 --> 08:56.560
 of obsessive compulsive disorder

08:56.560 --> 08:59.140
 is that the obsessions are intrusive.

08:59.140 --> 09:00.900
 People don't want to have them.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.100
 They don't enjoy having them.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.960
 They just seem to pop into people's minds

09:03.960 --> 09:06.700
 and they seem to pop into their mind recurrently.

09:06.700 --> 09:11.500
 And the compulsions, unlike other sorts of behaviors,

09:11.500 --> 09:14.600
 provide brief relief to the obsession,

09:14.600 --> 09:18.840
 but then very quickly reinforce or strengthen the obsession.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.940
 This is a very key theme to realize

09:20.940 --> 09:22.480
 about obsessive compulsive disorder.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.980
 So I'm just going to repeat it again.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.260
 These two features,

09:25.260 --> 09:28.140
 first, the fact that the obsessions are intrusive

09:28.140 --> 09:31.940
 and recurrent, as well as the fact that the compulsions,

09:31.940 --> 09:34.300
 the behaviors, provide, if anything,

09:34.300 --> 09:36.720
 only brief relief for the obsessions,

09:36.720 --> 09:37.620
 but in most cases,

09:37.620 --> 09:40.060
 simply serve to make the obsession stronger,

09:40.060 --> 09:43.700
 are the hallmark features of obsessive compulsive disorder.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.400
 And it turns out to be very important to keep these in mind

09:46.400 --> 09:47.500
 as we go forward,

09:47.500 --> 09:50.500
 not just because they define obsessive compulsive disorder,

09:50.500 --> 09:52.240
 but they also define the sorts of treatments

09:52.240 --> 09:53.900
 that will and will not work

09:53.900 --> 09:55.660
 for obsessive compulsive disorder.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.260
 And then once you understand a little bit

09:57.260 --> 09:58.340
 about the neural circuitry

09:58.340 --> 10:00.100
 underlying obsessive compulsive disorder,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.000
 which we'll talk about in a few moments,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.740
 then you will clearly understand

10:03.740 --> 10:06.080
 why being a quote unquote obsessive person

10:06.080 --> 10:08.420
 or having obsessive compulsive personality

10:08.420 --> 10:10.680
 is not the same as OCD.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.620
 In fact, we can leap ahead a little bit

10:12.620 --> 10:14.680
 and compare and contrast OCD

10:14.680 --> 10:17.120
 with obsessive compulsive personality disorder

10:17.120 --> 10:20.160
 along one very particular set of features.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.120
 Again, I'll go into this in more detail later,

10:22.120 --> 10:25.820
 but it's fair to say that OCD is characterized

10:25.820 --> 10:28.480
 by these recurrent and intrusive obsessions.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.440
 And as I mentioned before,

10:29.440 --> 10:31.700
 the fact that those obsessions get stronger

10:31.700 --> 10:34.480
 as a function of people performing certain behaviors.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.560
 So unlike an itch that you feel

10:36.560 --> 10:38.300
 and then you scratch it and it feels better,

10:38.300 --> 10:39.940
 OCD is more like an itch that you feel,

10:39.940 --> 10:42.820
 you scratch it and the itch intensifies.

10:42.820 --> 10:45.460
 That contour or that pattern of behaviors

10:45.460 --> 10:47.840
 and thoughts interacting is very different

10:47.840 --> 10:50.300
 than obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

10:50.300 --> 10:54.020
 which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification

10:54.020 --> 10:56.500
 that people want and somewhat enjoy

10:56.500 --> 10:58.320
 because it allows them to function better

10:58.320 --> 10:59.840
 or more in line with how they would like

10:59.840 --> 11:01.260
 to show up in the world.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.380
 So again, OCD has mainly to do with obsessions

11:04.380 --> 11:05.520
 that are intrusive and recurrent,

11:05.520 --> 11:07.920
 whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder

11:07.920 --> 11:10.220
 does not have that intrusive feature to it.

11:10.220 --> 11:13.220
 People do not mind or in fact often invite

11:13.220 --> 11:15.580
 or like the particular patterns of thought

11:15.580 --> 11:18.540
 that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.260
 So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder

11:21.260 --> 11:24.020
 for the moment, let's focus a bit more on OCD

11:24.020 --> 11:26.820
 and define how it tends to show up in the world.

11:26.820 --> 11:31.120
 First of all, OCD is extremely common.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.460
 In fact, current estimates are that anywhere

11:33.460 --> 11:38.460
 from 2.5% to as high as three or even 4%

11:38.460 --> 11:40.980
 of people suffer from true OCD.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.860
 That is an astonishingly high number.

11:43.860 --> 11:45.860
 Now, the reason the range is so big,

11:45.860 --> 11:49.180
 2.5% all the way up to three or maybe even 4%,

11:49.180 --> 11:53.700
 is that a lot of the features of OCD go unnoticed,

11:53.700 --> 11:56.140
 both in the clinician's office

11:56.140 --> 11:58.840
 and simply because people don't report it

11:58.840 --> 12:00.300
 and don't talk about it.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.100
 In fact, it is possible to have recurrent

12:02.100 --> 12:04.600
 and intrusive obsessions and not engage

12:04.600 --> 12:06.760
 in the sorts of behaviors that would ever allow people

12:06.760 --> 12:09.280
 to notice that somebody has OCD.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.440
 That can be because some of the intrusive thoughts

12:12.440 --> 12:15.300
 don't actually lead to overt behaviors like hand-washing

12:15.300 --> 12:17.260
 or checking that other people would notice.

12:17.260 --> 12:20.700
 It can also be because people learn to disguise

12:20.700 --> 12:24.300
 or hide their obsessions and their compulsions out of shame

12:24.300 --> 12:27.620
 or fear of looking strange or whatever it might be,

12:27.620 --> 12:30.660
 such that they have these obsessive and intrusive thoughts

12:30.660 --> 12:32.540
 and they do little micro-behaviors,

12:32.540 --> 12:34.740
 like they might tap their fingers on their fly

12:34.740 --> 12:37.380
 as a way to avoid, at least in their own mind,

12:37.380 --> 12:39.140
 something catastrophic happening.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.900
 That might seem crazy to you, it might seem bizarre,

12:41.900 --> 12:43.060
 but this is the sort of thing

12:43.060 --> 12:45.420
 that operates in a lot of people.

12:45.420 --> 12:46.940
 And I really want to emphasize this

12:46.940 --> 12:50.060
 because the clinical literature that are out there

12:50.060 --> 12:54.020
 really point to the fact that many people have OCD,

12:54.020 --> 12:56.100
 full-blown OCD, and never report it

12:56.100 --> 12:59.500
 because of the kind of shame and hiding associated with it.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.260
 Another thing to point out is that OCD

13:02.260 --> 13:04.720
 is extremely debilitating.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.100
 I mentioned this a few minutes ago,

13:06.100 --> 13:08.980
 but OCD is currently listed as at number seven

13:08.980 --> 13:11.580
 in terms of the most debilitating illnesses,

13:11.580 --> 13:14.980
 not just mental illnesses or disorders,

13:14.980 --> 13:16.680
 but all types of illnesses,

13:16.680 --> 13:19.500
 including things like asthma and cancer, et cetera.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.300
 So you can imagine with that standing at number seven,

13:23.300 --> 13:25.620
 that it is both extremely common

13:25.620 --> 13:27.060
 and extremely debilitating.

13:27.060 --> 13:31.440
 And as a consequence, it's now realized that many hours,

13:31.440 --> 13:35.540
 days, weeks, months, or even years of work performance

13:35.540 --> 13:38.920
 or showing up at work, of relational interactions,

13:38.920 --> 13:41.460
 really suffer as a consequence of people having OCD.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.760
 So this is a vital problem that the scientific

13:43.760 --> 13:46.420
 and psychiatric and psychological communities understand.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.520
 And it's one of the reasons that I'm doing this podcast.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.380
 And of course, I received a ton of interest in OCD

13:52.380 --> 13:55.140
 because of this incredibly high incidence of OCD

13:55.140 --> 13:56.940
 and how debilitating it is.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.160
 We could go really deep into why it's so debilitating.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.380
 I don't want to spend too much time on that

14:01.380 --> 14:03.100
 because I think most of that is pretty obvious,

14:03.100 --> 14:04.500
 but some of it is not.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.660
 For instance, one of the things that makes OCD

14:06.660 --> 14:08.780
 so debilitating is of course the shame

14:08.780 --> 14:10.180
 that we talked about before,

14:10.180 --> 14:12.980
 but it's also the fact that when people are focusing

14:12.980 --> 14:14.600
 on their obsessions and their compulsions,

14:14.600 --> 14:16.560
 they're not able to focus on other things.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.960
 That's simply the way that the brain works.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.380
 We're not able to focus on too many things at once.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.580
 The other thing is that OCD takes a lot of time

14:23.580 --> 14:25.320
 out of people's lives.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.700
 With recurrent intrusive thoughts happening

14:27.700 --> 14:30.020
 at very high frequency or even at moderate frequency,

14:30.020 --> 14:32.820
 people are spending a lot of time thinking about this stuff

14:32.820 --> 14:34.740
 and they're thinking about the behaviors

14:34.740 --> 14:36.820
 they need to engage in and then engaging in the behaviors,

14:36.820 --> 14:37.840
 which as I mentioned before,

14:37.840 --> 14:39.440
 just serve to strengthen the compulsions.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.540
 And so they're not actually doing the other things

14:41.540 --> 14:43.300
 that make us functional human beings,

14:43.300 --> 14:46.300
 like commuting to work or doing homework or doing work

14:46.300 --> 14:48.780
 or listening when people are talking or interacting

14:48.780 --> 14:49.680
 or sports or working out.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.720
 All the things that make for a rich quality life

14:52.720 --> 14:56.020
 are taken over by OCD in many cases.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.820
 So while that might be obvious to some,

14:57.820 --> 14:59.520
 I'm not sure that it's obvious to everybody

14:59.520 --> 15:02.500
 just how much time OCD can occupy.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.220
 Another thing you'll soon learn is that sadly,

15:05.220 --> 15:07.860
 a lot of the obsessions and compulsions in OCD

15:07.860 --> 15:09.680
 often relate to taboo topics.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.720
 And that's because the general categories of OCD

15:12.720 --> 15:15.440
 fall into three different bins,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.820
 checking obsessions and compulsions,

15:17.820 --> 15:20.220
 repetition obsessions and compulsions

15:20.220 --> 15:22.380
 and order obsessions and compulsions.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.980
 The checking ones are somewhat obvious,

15:23.980 --> 15:26.300
 checking the stove or checking the locks,

15:26.300 --> 15:27.720
 which I think we all tend to do.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.480
 I'm somebody typically I'll head off to the car

15:30.480 --> 15:31.700
 to commute to work.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.160
 And I'll think I locked the front door

15:33.160 --> 15:34.580
 and I'll go back once.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.840
 But I won't go back twice or 50 times.

15:36.840 --> 15:40.320
 People with OCD will often go back 20 or 30 times

15:40.320 --> 15:42.500
 before they'll actually allow themselves to drive off.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.780
 And then it's a real challenge for them

15:44.780 --> 15:47.340
 to continue to drive off and discard with the idea

15:47.340 --> 15:48.580
 that they didn't check the stove

15:48.580 --> 15:49.660
 or they didn't check the locks

15:49.660 --> 15:52.340
 or they didn't check something else critical.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.660
 Repetition obsessions and compulsions

15:54.660 --> 15:57.840
 obviously can dovetail with the checking ones,

15:57.840 --> 16:00.000
 but those tend to be things like counting off

16:00.000 --> 16:02.200
 of a certain number of numbers,

16:02.200 --> 16:04.100
 like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

16:04.100 --> 16:05.500
 seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.380
 People will perform that repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly

16:08.380 --> 16:09.980
 or feel that they have to.

16:09.980 --> 16:12.100
 I remember years ago watching a documentary

16:12.100 --> 16:14.940
 about the band, the Ramones.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.360
 Most people heard of the Ramones, right?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.140
 Jeans, t-shirts, aviator glasses.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.700
 Everyone had to change their last name to Ramone.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.460
 They weren't actually all related to one another,

16:21.460 --> 16:23.500
 by the way, you had to change your last name to Ramone.

16:23.500 --> 16:27.360
 The Ramones had one band member who was admittedly

16:27.360 --> 16:29.420
 and known to others as having OCD.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.040
 And during that documentary, which I forget the name,

16:32.040 --> 16:33.900
 I think it was called, can't remember.

16:33.900 --> 16:37.100
 Anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.540
 But in this documentary,

16:38.540 --> 16:43.540
 the band members describe Joey Ramone as leaving hotels,

16:43.860 --> 16:45.640
 walking down the stairs to the parking lot,

16:45.640 --> 16:47.540
 but then having to walk up and down them seven or eight

16:47.540 --> 16:49.500
 times and sometimes getting out of the van again

16:49.500 --> 16:51.620
 and walking up and down them seven or eight times.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.580
 And it always had to be a certain number of times

16:53.580 --> 16:55.060
 given a certain number of stairs.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.660
 This appears quote unquote crazy,

16:56.660 --> 16:58.980
 but of course we don't want to think of this as crazy.

16:58.980 --> 17:03.220
 This is somebody who very likely had full-blown OCD.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.160
 Now that particular example, believe it or not,

17:05.160 --> 17:07.820
 is not all that uncommon.

17:07.820 --> 17:10.340
 It just so happens that that example entailed

17:10.340 --> 17:12.740
 certain compulsions and behaviors that were overt

17:12.740 --> 17:14.780
 and that other people could see.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.860
 And you can imagine how that would prevent somebody

17:16.860 --> 17:18.540
 from moving about their daily life easily.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.320
 A lot of people, as I mentioned before,

17:20.320 --> 17:22.740
 have obsessions and compulsions that they hide

17:22.740 --> 17:24.260
 and they do these little micro-behaviors

17:24.260 --> 17:26.380
 or they'll just count off in their head

17:26.380 --> 17:28.600
 as opposed to generating some sort of walking up

17:28.600 --> 17:31.420
 and down stairs or tapping or things of that sort.

17:31.420 --> 17:32.960
 So we have checking, we have repetition,

17:32.960 --> 17:34.580
 and then there's order.

17:34.580 --> 17:39.420
 Order oftentimes is thought of as putting cleanliness

17:39.420 --> 17:41.460
 or making sure everything is aligned

17:41.460 --> 17:43.720
 and perfect and orderly.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.360
 And oftentimes that is the case,

17:45.360 --> 17:48.100
 but there are other forms of order that people with OCD

17:48.100 --> 17:51.680
 can focus on in a obsessive and compulsive way.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.260
 Things like incompleteness,

17:53.260 --> 17:56.320
 the idea that one can't walk away from something

17:56.320 --> 17:58.600
 or stop doing something because something's not right

17:58.600 --> 18:00.540
 or complete in that picture.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.940
 It could be the way the table is set.

18:02.940 --> 18:05.060
 It could be the way that something's written on a page.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.700
 It could be an email.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.660
 Again, now we're still talking about OCD, the disorder.

18:09.660 --> 18:10.700
 We're not talking about

18:10.700 --> 18:13.820
 obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.160
 I'm aware of, well, I'll just be direct,

18:16.160 --> 18:18.480
 several colleagues of mine, and it's just remarkable,

18:18.480 --> 18:20.260
 the order in their emails.

18:20.260 --> 18:23.260
 Every email is perfect, punctuated perfect,

18:23.260 --> 18:25.860
 grammar perfect, everything's spaced perfect.

18:25.860 --> 18:26.780
 Do they have OCD?

18:26.780 --> 18:27.940
 Well, they might, they might not.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.320
 How would I know unless they disclose that to me?

18:31.320 --> 18:34.540
 But they might have obsessive compulsive personality disorder

18:34.540 --> 18:37.880
 or they just might be able to generate a lot of order

18:37.880 --> 18:39.160
 and they have a lot of discipline

18:39.160 --> 18:40.920
 around the way they write and the way they present

18:40.920 --> 18:43.620
 any communication with anybody at all.

18:43.620 --> 18:47.840
 So if somebody has a OCD that's in the domain of order,

18:47.840 --> 18:50.980
 it could be incompleteness and the constant feeling

18:50.980 --> 18:54.220
 of something not being completed and a need to complete it.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.140
 It can also be in terms of symmetry,

18:56.140 --> 18:58.680
 that everything be aligned and symmetric in some way.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.900
 This could be seen perhaps in young kids.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.020
 This is one example that I read in the literature

19:04.020 --> 19:06.540
 of children that need to arrange their stuffed animals

19:06.540 --> 19:11.540
 in exact same order every day and in a particular order

19:11.540 --> 19:13.600
 to the point where if you were to move

19:13.600 --> 19:15.900
 the little stuffed frog over next to the stuffed rabbit,

19:15.900 --> 19:19.520
 that the child would have an anxiety reaction to that

19:19.520 --> 19:23.500
 and feel literally compelled, driven to fix that,

19:23.500 --> 19:26.360
 maybe even multiple times over and over again.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.920
 We'll talk about OCD in children

19:27.920 --> 19:29.400
 versus adults in a little bit.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.620
 And then the other aspect of order,

19:31.620 --> 19:33.880
 which is a little bit less than intuitive

19:33.880 --> 19:35.580
 is this notion of disgust.

19:35.580 --> 19:37.440
 This idea that something is contaminated.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.240
 So we often think about OCD and hand-washing behavior

19:41.240 --> 19:44.200
 in response to people feeling that something is contaminated,

19:44.200 --> 19:46.260
 a space, a towel, et cetera,

19:46.260 --> 19:48.440
 or even simply somebody else's hand.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.780
 And so they're unwilling to shake somebody's hand.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.480
 You can imagine how these different bins of obsessions

19:53.480 --> 19:56.760
 and compulsions, checking repetition and order

19:56.760 --> 19:58.040
 could be extremely debilitating

19:58.040 --> 19:59.440
 depending on how severe they are

19:59.440 --> 20:02.760
 and how many different domains of life they show up in.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.640
 Because oftentimes in movies,

20:04.640 --> 20:06.640
 and even the way I'm describing it now,

20:06.640 --> 20:09.360
 it sounds as if, okay, well, somebody has to check the locks

20:09.360 --> 20:11.180
 but they don't have to also check the stove.

20:11.180 --> 20:14.880
 Or somebody has the need to count to seven back and forth

20:14.880 --> 20:16.040
 up to seven and down to seven,

20:16.040 --> 20:19.380
 seven times a day or something of that sort.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.180
 Where they need symmetry in very specific domains of life.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.820
 But it turns out that this recurrent

20:24.820 --> 20:29.200
 and intrusive aspect of obsessions leads people with OCD

20:29.200 --> 20:31.880
 to have checking repetition

20:31.880 --> 20:35.420
 and or order compulsions everywhere.

20:35.420 --> 20:38.100
 So whether or not somebody is at work or in school

20:38.100 --> 20:39.480
 or trying to engage in sport

20:39.480 --> 20:40.920
 or trying to engage in relationship

20:40.920 --> 20:43.580
 or just something simple like walking down the street,

20:43.580 --> 20:45.880
 the obsessions are so intrusive that they show up

20:45.880 --> 20:48.700
 and they compel people to do things in that domain

20:48.700 --> 20:51.120
 independent of whether or not

20:51.120 --> 20:53.040
 they happen to be in one location or another.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.640
 In other words, the thought patterns and the behaviors

20:56.640 --> 20:59.220
 take over the environment as opposed to the environment

20:59.220 --> 21:01.460
 driving the thought patterns and behaviors.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.100
 So it therefore becomes impossible

21:03.100 --> 21:05.200
 to ever find a room that's clean enough

21:05.200 --> 21:07.760
 to find a bed that's made well enough

21:07.760 --> 21:10.720
 to find anything that's done well enough

21:10.720 --> 21:13.180
 to remove the obsession.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.080
 And I know I've said it multiple times now,

21:15.080 --> 21:18.020
 but I'm going to say it many times throughout this episode

21:18.020 --> 21:21.940
 in a somewhat obsessive, but I believe justified way

21:21.940 --> 21:25.580
 that every time that one engages in the compulsion

21:25.580 --> 21:26.780
 related to the obsession,

21:26.780 --> 21:28.920
 the obsession simply becomes stronger.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.320
 So you can imagine what a powerful

21:31.320 --> 21:33.340
 and debilitating loop that really is.

21:33.340 --> 21:34.740
 So let's drill a little bit deeper

21:34.740 --> 21:36.460
 into how the obsessions and compulsions

21:36.460 --> 21:37.860
 relate to one another.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.100
 If we were to draw a line

21:39.100 --> 21:41.420
 between the obsessions and the compulsions,

21:41.420 --> 21:45.660
 that line could be described as anxiety.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.840
 Now we need to define what anxiety is.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.900
 And to be quite honest,

21:49.900 --> 21:51.820
 most of psychology and science

21:51.820 --> 21:53.980
 can't agree on exactly what anxiety is.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.220
 Typically the way we think about fear

21:56.220 --> 21:59.020
 is that it's a heightened state of autonomic arousal.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.940
 So increased heart rate, increased breathing,

22:00.940 --> 22:02.240
 sweating, et cetera,

22:02.240 --> 22:04.940
 in response to an immediate and present threat

22:04.940 --> 22:06.320
 or perceived threat.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.540
 Whereas anxiety, generally speaking

22:08.540 --> 22:09.960
 in the scientific literature,

22:09.960 --> 22:13.700
 relates to the same sorts of thought patterns

22:13.700 --> 22:15.820
 and somatic bodily responses,

22:15.820 --> 22:17.540
 heart rate, breathing, et cetera,

22:17.540 --> 22:20.700
 but without a clear and present danger

22:20.700 --> 22:22.980
 being in the environment or right there.

22:22.980 --> 22:23.820
 So that's the way

22:23.820 --> 22:25.820
 that we're going to talk about anxiety now.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.580
 And anxiety is really what binds the obsessions

22:28.580 --> 22:29.820
 and compulsions such that

22:29.820 --> 22:31.660
 someone will have an intrusive thought.

22:31.660 --> 22:34.140
 So for instance, someone will have the thought that

22:34.140 --> 22:36.900
 if they turn left on any street,

22:36.900 --> 22:38.780
 that something bad will happen, okay?

22:38.780 --> 22:39.620
 That's an obsession.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.380
 It's actually not all that uncommon.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.580
 Now, how bad and what the specificity

22:43.580 --> 22:45.380
 of that bad thing really is will vary.

22:45.380 --> 22:47.380
 Some people will think if I turn left,

22:47.380 --> 22:48.820
 something generally bad will happen.

22:48.820 --> 22:50.140
 It just makes me feel anxious.

22:50.140 --> 22:52.080
 So they always insist on going right.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.180
 Whereas other people will think if I turn left,

22:55.180 --> 22:58.180
 so-and-so will die or I will die

22:58.180 --> 23:00.420
 or something terrible will happen.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.620
 I'll get a disease or someone else will get a disease

23:02.620 --> 23:04.600
 or I'll be cursing myself or somebody else

23:04.600 --> 23:06.580
 in some very specific way.

23:06.580 --> 23:10.820
 This is unfortunately quite common in people with OCD.

23:10.820 --> 23:14.940
 So they have this feeling and the feeling can be generally

23:14.940 --> 23:17.200
 or specifically related to a particular outcome.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.060
 But beneath that is a feeling of anxiety,

23:20.060 --> 23:22.060
 a quickening of the heartbeat,

23:22.060 --> 23:23.540
 a quickening of breathing,

23:23.540 --> 23:26.260
 a narrowing of one's visual focus.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.080
 I've talked about this before on other podcasts,

23:28.080 --> 23:29.700
 the master stress and other podcasts.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.380
 But if you haven't heard those,

23:31.380 --> 23:32.740
 let me just briefly describe that

23:32.740 --> 23:34.580
 when we are in a state of increased

23:34.580 --> 23:38.180
 so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera,

23:38.180 --> 23:40.400
 our visual field literally narrows.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.940
 The aperture of our visual field gets smaller

23:42.940 --> 23:44.160
 and that's because of the relationship

23:44.160 --> 23:46.980
 between the autonomic nervous system and your visual system.

23:46.980 --> 23:49.700
 So you start seeing the world through sort of

23:49.700 --> 23:52.060
 soda straw view or through binocular like view

23:52.060 --> 23:53.580
 as opposed to seeing the big picture.

23:53.580 --> 23:54.580
 Why is that important?

23:54.580 --> 23:58.780
 Well, it literally sharpens and narrows your focus

23:58.780 --> 24:00.780
 toward the very thing that the obsessions

24:00.780 --> 24:02.040
 and the compulsions are focused on.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.380
 So the person walking down the street

24:03.380 --> 24:06.200
 who sees the opportunity to go left or right

24:06.200 --> 24:09.640
 will only see the bad decision.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.500
 Their visual field narrows very tightly

24:12.500 --> 24:15.180
 along that possibility of taking a left turn.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.620
 And I know as I described, this seems totally irrational,

24:17.620 --> 24:20.420
 but I want to emphasize that the person with OCD

24:20.420 --> 24:22.420
 knows it's irrational.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.860
 They might feel crazy because they're having these thoughts,

24:25.860 --> 24:27.980
 but they know it makes no sense whatsoever

24:27.980 --> 24:30.820
 that left somehow would be different than right

24:30.820 --> 24:33.500
 in terms of outcomes in this particular case.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.060
 And yet it feels as if it would.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.460
 In fact, in some cases, it feels as if they went left,

24:38.460 --> 24:40.820
 they would have a full-blown panic attack.

24:40.820 --> 24:43.980
 So the idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions

24:43.980 --> 24:48.260
 are bound by anxiety, but then by taking a right-hand turn,

24:48.260 --> 24:50.400
 again, in this one particular example,

24:50.400 --> 24:53.880
 by taking a right-hand turn, there's a very brief,

24:53.880 --> 24:57.660
 I should mention very brief relief of that anxiety

24:57.660 --> 25:01.700
 at the time of the decision to go right, not left.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.060
 And there's an additional drop in anxiety

25:05.060 --> 25:07.360
 while one takes the right-hand turn

25:07.360 --> 25:09.580
 as opposed to the left-hand turn.

25:09.580 --> 25:11.660
 And then as I alluded to before,

25:11.660 --> 25:14.300
 there's a reinforcement of the compulsion.

25:14.300 --> 25:16.100
 In other words, by going right,

25:16.100 --> 25:18.900
 it doesn't create a situation in the brain

25:18.900 --> 25:21.040
 and psychology of the person that,

25:21.040 --> 25:23.320
 oh, you know what, I'm not anxious anymore,

25:23.320 --> 25:25.100
 left would have probably been okay.

25:25.100 --> 25:28.420
 It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better

25:28.420 --> 25:30.220
 or turning right made me feel better

25:30.220 --> 25:32.660
 and going left would have been that much worse.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.660
 Again, it reinforces the obsession even further.

25:35.660 --> 25:40.200
 And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns

25:40.200 --> 25:41.860
 with something like hand-washing,

25:41.860 --> 25:44.180
 the feeling that something is contaminated

25:44.180 --> 25:45.740
 and the need to wash one's hands,

25:45.740 --> 25:47.820
 even though one already washed their hands

25:47.820 --> 25:49.980
 20, 30, 50 times prior.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.600
 And we're actually going to go back to that example

25:51.600 --> 25:53.620
 a little bit later when we talk about

25:53.620 --> 25:55.460
 one particular category of therapies

25:55.460 --> 25:58.620
 that are very effective in many people for OCD,

25:58.620 --> 26:01.420
 which are the cognitive behavioral and exposure therapies.

26:01.420 --> 26:02.840
 So I think some of you have heard

26:02.840 --> 26:04.900
 of cognitive behavioral and exposure therapies,

26:04.900 --> 26:07.060
 but the way they are used to treat OCD

26:07.060 --> 26:09.980
 is very much different than the way they're used to treat

26:09.980 --> 26:12.360
 other sorts of anxiety disorders

26:12.360 --> 26:14.680
 and other sorts of disorders generally.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.180
 So it's fair to say that up to 70% of people with OCD

26:19.180 --> 26:22.860
 have some sort of anxiety or elevated anxiety,

26:22.860 --> 26:25.120
 either directly related to the OCD

26:25.120 --> 26:26.820
 or indirectly related to the OCD.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.460
 And it's really hard to tease those apart

26:28.460 --> 26:31.640
 because OCD can create its own anxiety.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.700
 As I mentioned before, it can even increase its own anxiety.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.660
 And there's also an issue of depression.

26:37.660 --> 26:40.460
 Having OCD can be very depressing, right?

26:40.460 --> 26:43.560
 Especially if some of these OCD thoughts and behaviors

26:43.560 --> 26:46.180
 start to really impede people's ability to function in life

26:46.180 --> 26:47.700
 at work and school and relationship,

26:47.700 --> 26:49.780
 they can start feeling less optimistic about life.

26:49.780 --> 26:52.540
 And in fact, some people can become suicidally depressed.

26:52.540 --> 26:55.340
 That's how bad OCD can be for us.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.620
 So we have to be careful when saying

26:57.620 --> 27:00.540
 that 70% of people with OCD also have anxiety

27:00.540 --> 27:02.800
 or X number of people with OCD are also depressed

27:02.800 --> 27:04.140
 because we don't know whether or not

27:04.140 --> 27:06.700
 the depression led the OCD or the other way around,

27:06.700 --> 27:07.840
 or whether or not they're operating,

27:07.840 --> 27:09.800
 as we say in science, in parallel.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.820
 Some of the drug treatments for OCD and depression

27:11.820 --> 27:14.420
 and anxiety can tease some of that apart.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.600
 And we'll talk about that.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.040
 But I think it's fair to say that what binds the obsessions

27:19.040 --> 27:20.940
 and compulsions is anxiety,

27:20.940 --> 27:22.860
 that there's a feeling of it,

27:22.860 --> 27:25.060
 or I should say an urgent feeling of a need

27:25.060 --> 27:27.060
 to get rid of the obsession.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.700
 And the person feels as if the only way they can do that

27:29.700 --> 27:32.380
 is to engage in a particular compulsive behavior.

27:32.380 --> 27:33.680
 Some people are probably wondering

27:33.680 --> 27:36.260
 if there's a genetic component to OCD.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.940
 And indeed there is,

27:37.940 --> 27:40.500
 although the nature of it isn't exactly clear.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.620
 And oftentimes when people hear

27:42.620 --> 27:44.580
 that something has a genetic component,

27:44.580 --> 27:48.180
 they think it's always directly inherited from a parent.

27:48.180 --> 27:49.620
 And that's not always the case.

27:49.620 --> 27:52.720
 There can be genes that surface in siblings

27:52.720 --> 27:54.480
 or genes that surface in children

27:54.480 --> 27:56.540
 that are not readily apparent

27:56.540 --> 27:58.020
 in terms of what we call a phenotype.

27:58.020 --> 27:59.300
 So you have a genotype, the gene,

27:59.300 --> 28:00.420
 and then you have a phenotype,

28:00.420 --> 28:04.220
 the way it shows up as a body form or like eye color,

28:04.220 --> 28:06.860
 or how it shows up in terms of a behavior

28:06.860 --> 28:08.840
 or behavioral pattern.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.780
 Based on twin studies where researchers

28:11.780 --> 28:14.380
 have examined identical twins, fraternal twins,

28:14.380 --> 28:18.300
 even identical twins that share the same sac in utero,

28:18.300 --> 28:19.660
 what we call monochorionic.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.220
 So sitting in the same little bag during pregnancy

28:22.220 --> 28:23.700
 or in different little bags,

28:23.700 --> 28:24.800
 you can see different levels

28:24.800 --> 28:26.720
 of what's called genetic concordance.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.380
 But if we were to just sort of cut a broad swath

28:29.380 --> 28:31.100
 through all of the genetic data,

28:31.100 --> 28:35.320
 it's fair to say that about 40 to 50% of OCD cases

28:35.320 --> 28:36.740
 have some genetic component,

28:36.740 --> 28:40.180
 some mutation or some inherited aspect that's genetic

28:40.180 --> 28:43.140
 and that one could point to if they got their genome mapped.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.260
 Now, while that's interesting,

28:44.260 --> 28:46.560
 I don't think it's terribly useful for most people.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.940
 First of all, you can't really control your genes,

28:48.940 --> 28:50.740
 at least at this point in history,

28:50.740 --> 28:53.180
 even though there are things like epigenetic control

28:53.180 --> 28:55.740
 and people are very excited about technologies like CRISPR

28:55.740 --> 28:57.260
 for modifying the genome.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.600
 In humans at some point,

29:00.460 --> 29:02.580
 most people can't control their genetics, right?

29:02.580 --> 29:04.740
 You can't pick who your parents were, as they say.

29:04.740 --> 29:07.140
 So just know that there is a genetic component

29:07.140 --> 29:10.780
 in about half of people with OCD, but not always.

29:10.780 --> 29:13.260
 Now, as is typical for this podcast,

29:13.260 --> 29:15.940
 I want to focus on some of the neural mechanisms

29:15.940 --> 29:18.100
 and chemical systems in the brain and body

29:18.100 --> 29:20.720
 that generate obsessive compulsive disorder.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.020
 In fact, if you've watched this podcast before,

29:23.020 --> 29:24.580
 listened to this podcast before,

29:24.580 --> 29:26.300
 this is always how I structure things.

29:26.300 --> 29:30.020
 First, we introduce a topic and we explore that topic

29:30.020 --> 29:32.580
 in detail and really define what it is and what it isn't.

29:32.580 --> 29:36.020
 And then it's very important that we focus on what is known

29:36.020 --> 29:39.280
 and what is not known about the biological mechanisms

29:39.280 --> 29:41.300
 that generate whatever that thing happens to be,

29:41.300 --> 29:42.140
 in this case, OCD

29:42.140 --> 29:44.500
 or obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.940
 Now, I want to emphasize that even if you don't have

29:46.940 --> 29:48.740
 a background in biology,

29:48.740 --> 29:50.700
 I will make this information accessible to you.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.820
 And I also want to emphasize that for those of you

29:52.820 --> 29:54.380
 that are interested in treatments

29:54.380 --> 29:58.300
 and are anxiously awaiting the description of things

29:58.300 --> 30:02.860
 that can help with OCD, I encourage you, if you will,

30:02.860 --> 30:05.340
 to please try and digest some of the material

30:05.340 --> 30:06.620
 about the underlying mechanisms,

30:06.620 --> 30:08.700
 because understanding even just a little bit

30:08.700 --> 30:11.760
 of those biological mechanisms can really help shed light

30:11.760 --> 30:15.060
 on why particular drug and behavioral treatments

30:15.060 --> 30:18.100
 and other sorts of treatments work and don't work.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.940
 This is especially important in the case of OCD,

30:20.940 --> 30:23.560
 where it turns out that the order and type of treatment

30:23.560 --> 30:26.020
 can really vary according to individual.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.940
 And that's something really special and important about OCD

30:28.940 --> 30:31.160
 that we really can't say for a number of the other

30:31.160 --> 30:32.700
 sorts of disorders that we've described

30:32.700 --> 30:34.300
 on previous podcasts.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.660
 So let's take a step back and look at the neural circuitry.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.780
 What's going on in the brain and body of people with OCD?

30:40.780 --> 30:43.340
 Why the intrusive recurrent thoughts?

30:43.340 --> 30:44.380
 Why the compulsions?

30:44.380 --> 30:48.340
 Why is that whole system bound by anxiety?

30:48.340 --> 30:50.420
 And in some ways in thinking about that,

30:50.420 --> 30:53.840
 I want you to keep in mind that the brain

30:53.840 --> 30:55.580
 has two main functions.

30:56.420 --> 30:59.540
 The brain's main functions are to take care

30:59.540 --> 31:01.980
 of all the housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,

31:01.980 --> 31:03.020
 make sure the heart beats,

31:03.020 --> 31:05.180
 make sure you keep breathing no matter what,

31:05.180 --> 31:08.180
 make sure that you can see, you can hear,

31:08.180 --> 31:10.540
 you can smell, et cetera, the basic stuff.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.340
 And then there's an enormous amount of brain real estate

31:13.340 --> 31:15.700
 that's designed to allow you to predict

31:15.700 --> 31:16.920
 what's going to happen next,

31:16.920 --> 31:20.060
 either in the immediate future or in the long-term future.

31:20.060 --> 31:23.140
 And largely that's done based on your knowledge of the past.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.440
 So you also have memory systems.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.980
 And of course, you have systems in the brain and body

31:26.980 --> 31:29.740
 that are designed to bind what's happening

31:29.740 --> 31:31.820
 at the housekeeping level, like your heart rate,

31:31.820 --> 31:34.300
 to your anticipation of what's going to happen next.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.060
 So if you're thinking about something very fearful,

31:36.060 --> 31:37.620
 your body will have one type of reaction.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.260
 If you're thinking about something very pleasant

31:39.260 --> 31:41.900
 and relaxing, your body will have another type of reaction.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.900
 So whenever I hear about the brain-body distinction,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.980
 I have to just remind everybody

31:46.980 --> 31:49.700
 that there really is no distinction between brain and body

31:49.700 --> 31:51.420
 when you think about it through the nervous system.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.980
 The nervous system is the brain, the eyes, the spinal cord,

31:53.980 --> 31:55.380
 but of course, all their connections

31:55.380 --> 31:56.500
 with all the organs of the body

31:56.500 --> 31:58.240
 and the connections of all the organs of the body

31:58.240 --> 32:00.280
 with the brain, the spinal cord, et cetera.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.860
 So as I describe these neural circuits,

32:02.860 --> 32:03.820
 I don't want you to think of them

32:03.820 --> 32:05.700
 as just things happening in the head.

32:05.700 --> 32:07.720
 They are certainly happening in the head.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.660
 In fact, the circuits I'll describe most in detail

32:10.660 --> 32:13.260
 do exist within the confines of your cranial vault,

32:13.260 --> 32:14.980
 that's nerd speak for skull,

32:14.980 --> 32:19.160
 but those circuits are driving particular predictions

32:19.160 --> 32:21.380
 and therefore particular biases

32:21.380 --> 32:23.440
 towards particular actions in your body.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.980
 They're creating a state of readiness

32:24.980 --> 32:28.660
 or a state of desire to check or desire to count

32:28.660 --> 32:32.060
 or desire to avoid, et cetera, et cetera.

32:32.060 --> 32:33.420
 So what are these circuits?

32:33.420 --> 32:36.440
 Well, there's been a lot of wonderful research

32:36.440 --> 32:38.120
 exploring the neural circuits

32:38.120 --> 32:40.760
 underlying obsessive compulsive disorder,

32:40.760 --> 32:41.900
 and that's mainly been accomplished

32:41.900 --> 32:43.460
 through a couple of methods.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.940
 Most of those methods when applied in humans

32:45.940 --> 32:48.740
 involve getting some look

32:48.740 --> 32:51.560
 into which brain areas are active

32:51.560 --> 32:53.040
 when people are having obsessions

32:53.040 --> 32:55.740
 and when people are engaging in compulsions.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.380
 Now, that might seem simple to do,

32:57.380 --> 33:00.480
 but of course, your brain is housed inside the cranial vault

33:00.480 --> 33:01.740
 and in order to look inside it,

33:01.740 --> 33:04.060
 you have to use things like magnetic resonance imaging,

33:04.060 --> 33:07.500
 which is just fancy technology for looking at blood flow,

33:07.500 --> 33:10.980
 which relates to activation of neurons, nerve cells,

33:10.980 --> 33:13.980
 or things like PET, P-E-T imaging,

33:13.980 --> 33:15.660
 which has nothing to do with the verb pet

33:15.660 --> 33:17.580
 and has nothing to do with your house pet,

33:17.580 --> 33:20.420
 has everything to do with positron emission tomography,

33:20.420 --> 33:22.120
 which is just another way of seeing

33:22.120 --> 33:23.480
 which brain areas are active,

33:23.480 --> 33:24.740
 and then you can also use PET

33:24.740 --> 33:27.140
 to figure out what sorts of neurochemicals are active,

33:27.140 --> 33:29.180
 like dopamine, et cetera.

33:29.180 --> 33:32.620
 Many studies, we can fairly say dozens,

33:32.620 --> 33:35.360
 if not hundreds of studies have now identified

33:35.360 --> 33:38.440
 a particular circuit or loop of brain areas

33:38.440 --> 33:40.920
 that are interconnected and very active

33:40.920 --> 33:43.200
 in obsessive compulsive disorder.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.340
 That loop includes the cortex,

33:47.340 --> 33:50.880
 which is kind of the outer shell of the human brain,

33:50.880 --> 33:53.680
 the lumpy stuff, as it sometimes appears

33:53.680 --> 33:55.180
 if the skull is removed,

33:55.180 --> 33:57.460
 and it involves an area called the striatum,

33:57.460 --> 33:59.180
 which is involved in action selection

33:59.180 --> 34:00.860
 and holding back action.

34:00.860 --> 34:03.140
 The striatum is involved in what's commonly called

34:03.140 --> 34:05.420
 go and no-go types of behaviors.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.360
 So every type of behavior,

34:06.360 --> 34:08.940
 like picking up a pen or a mug of coffee,

34:08.940 --> 34:11.380
 involves a go type function.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.500
 It involves generating an action.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.080
 But every time I resist an action,

34:16.080 --> 34:17.680
 my nervous system is also doing that

34:17.680 --> 34:20.820
 using this brain structure, the striatum,

34:20.820 --> 34:24.060
 which includes, among other things, the basal ganglia.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.140
 Talked about that before.

34:25.140 --> 34:27.140
 I'm not trying to overload you with terminology here,

34:27.140 --> 34:29.480
 but I know some people are interested in terminology.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.440
 So you have go behaviors and you have no-go,

34:31.440 --> 34:35.700
 resisting of behaviors, not going toward behavior.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.540
 The cortex and the striatum

34:37.540 --> 34:39.980
 are in this intricate back-and-forth talk.

34:39.980 --> 34:41.320
 It's really loops of connections.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.060
 The cortex doesn't tell the striatum what to do.

34:43.060 --> 34:45.060
 The striatum doesn't tell the cortex what to do.

34:45.060 --> 34:45.940
 They're in a crosstalk.

34:45.940 --> 34:47.020
 Like any good relationship,

34:47.020 --> 34:49.860
 there's a lot of back-and-forth communication.

34:49.860 --> 34:53.660
 There's a third element in this corticostriatal loop,

34:53.660 --> 34:56.060
 as it's called, and that's the thalamus.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.420
 Now, the thalamus is not a structure

34:57.420 --> 34:59.580
 I've talked a lot about before on this podcast,

34:59.580 --> 35:01.980
 but it's one of my favorite structures to think about

35:01.980 --> 35:03.580
 and teach about in neuroanatomy,

35:03.580 --> 35:05.500
 which I teach back at Stanford

35:05.500 --> 35:07.440
 and have taught for many years elsewhere,

35:07.440 --> 35:10.580
 because the thalamus is this incredible egg-like structure

35:10.580 --> 35:12.340
 in the center of your brain

35:12.340 --> 35:14.480
 that has different channels through it,

35:14.480 --> 35:17.380
 channels for relaying visual information

35:17.380 --> 35:20.520
 or auditory information or touch information

35:20.520 --> 35:23.920
 from your environment up into your cortex,

35:23.920 --> 35:24.760
 and as a consequence,

35:24.760 --> 35:27.320
 making certain things that are happening to you,

35:27.320 --> 35:29.500
 and around you, apparent to you,

35:29.500 --> 35:30.560
 making you aware of them,

35:30.560 --> 35:34.420
 making you perceive them, and suppressing others.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.120
 So for instance, right now, if you're hearing me say this,

35:37.120 --> 35:40.420
 your thalamus has what are called auditory nuclei.

35:40.420 --> 35:41.820
 Those are just collections of neurons

35:41.820 --> 35:44.940
 that respond to sound waves

35:44.940 --> 35:46.940
 that are, of course, coming in through your ears,

35:46.940 --> 35:49.860
 and your thalamus is active in a way

35:49.860 --> 35:52.260
 that those particular regions of your thalamus

35:52.260 --> 35:54.860
 are allowed, literally permitted,

35:54.860 --> 35:57.100
 to pass the information coming from your ears

35:57.100 --> 35:58.600
 through some other steps,

35:58.600 --> 36:00.580
 but then to your thalamus, your auditory thalamus,

36:00.580 --> 36:01.580
 then up to your cortex,

36:01.580 --> 36:03.860
 and you can hear what I'm saying right now.

36:03.860 --> 36:06.820
 At the same time, your thalamus is surrounded

36:06.820 --> 36:07.880
 by a kind of a shell,

36:07.880 --> 36:09.940
 something called the thalamic reticular nucleus.

36:09.940 --> 36:11.400
 Again, you don't have to remember the names,

36:11.400 --> 36:13.180
 but this thalamic reticular nucleus

36:13.180 --> 36:15.700
 also sometimes called the reticular thalamic nucleus.

36:15.700 --> 36:18.220
 This is, believe it or not, a subject of debate in science.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.880
 There are people that literally hated each other,

36:19.880 --> 36:20.820
 probably still hate each other,

36:20.820 --> 36:22.220
 even though one of them's dead,

36:22.220 --> 36:23.580
 for decades because they would argue

36:23.580 --> 36:24.900
 it was the thalamic reticular nucleus,

36:24.900 --> 36:27.180
 the other was reticular thalamic nucleus.

36:27.180 --> 36:29.580
 Anyway, these are scientists, they're people.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.000
 They tend to debate.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.340
 But the thalamic reticular nucleus, as I'm going to call it,

36:34.340 --> 36:36.260
 serves as a sort of gate

36:36.260 --> 36:38.760
 as to which information is allowed to pass through

36:38.760 --> 36:41.800
 up to your conscious experience and which is not.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.160
 And that gating mechanism is strongly regulated

36:44.160 --> 36:45.900
 by the chemical GABA.

36:45.900 --> 36:50.420
 GABA is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory, as we say.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.420
 It serves to shut down

36:52.420 --> 36:54.980
 or suppress the activity of other neurons.

36:54.980 --> 36:59.920
 So the thalamic reticular nucleus is really saying no.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.160
 Touch information cannot come in right now.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.820
 You should not be thinking about the contact

37:04.820 --> 37:05.780
 of the back of your legs

37:05.780 --> 37:07.860
 with the chair that you're sitting on, Andrew.

37:07.860 --> 37:09.500
 You should be thinking about what you're trying to say

37:09.500 --> 37:11.200
 and what you're hearing and how your voice sounds

37:11.200 --> 37:13.900
 and what you see in front of you, et cetera.

37:13.900 --> 37:17.280
 Whereas if I'm about to get an injection from a doctor

37:17.280 --> 37:19.540
 or I'm in pain or I'm in pleasure,

37:19.540 --> 37:22.220
 I'm going to think about my somatic sensation

37:22.220 --> 37:23.460
 at the level of touch.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.700
 And I'm probably going to think less about

37:25.700 --> 37:26.740
 smells in the room,

37:26.740 --> 37:28.540
 although I might also think about smells in the room

37:28.540 --> 37:30.300
 or what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.

37:30.300 --> 37:33.300
 We can combine all these different sensory modalities,

37:33.300 --> 37:34.940
 but the thalamic reticular nucleus

37:34.940 --> 37:36.980
 really allows us to funnel,

37:36.980 --> 37:40.040
 to direct particular categories of sensory experience

37:40.040 --> 37:41.400
 into our conscious awareness

37:41.400 --> 37:45.600
 and suppress other categories of sensory experience.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.300
 In addition, the thalamic reticular nucleus

37:48.300 --> 37:52.540
 plays a critical role in which thoughts are allowed

37:52.540 --> 37:54.820
 to pass up to our conscious perception

37:54.820 --> 37:56.700
 and which ones are not.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.360
 So much so that some neuroscientists

37:59.360 --> 38:01.500
 and indeed some neurophilosophers,

38:01.500 --> 38:02.640
 if you want to call them that,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.380
 have theorized or philosophized

38:04.380 --> 38:07.140
 that the thalamic reticular nucleus

38:07.140 --> 38:09.300
 is actually involved in our consciousness.

38:09.300 --> 38:10.700
 Now, consciousness is in a topic

38:10.700 --> 38:12.300
 that I really want to talk about this episode

38:12.300 --> 38:14.620
 and it's a very kind of mushy, murky,

38:14.620 --> 38:17.120
 as we say in science, it's a schmooey term

38:17.120 --> 38:18.900
 because it doesn't really have clear definitions

38:18.900 --> 38:21.020
 so arguments about it often get lost in the fact

38:21.020 --> 38:22.960
 that people are arguing about different things.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.400
 But when I say consciousness,

38:24.400 --> 38:26.260
 what I mean is conscious awareness.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.760
 So let's zoom out and take a look at the circuit

38:28.760 --> 38:30.420
 that we've got and that we now know

38:30.420 --> 38:33.860
 based on neuroimaging studies is intimately involved

38:33.860 --> 38:36.720
 in generating obsessions and compulsions in OCD.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.220
 We have a cortex or neocortex,

38:39.220 --> 38:40.720
 which is involved in perception

38:40.720 --> 38:42.520
 and understanding of what's happening.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.700
 We have the striatum and basal ganglia,

38:44.700 --> 38:47.420
 which are involved in generating behaviors, GO,

38:47.420 --> 38:49.460
 and suppressing behaviors, NO-GO.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.100
 And we have the thalamus,

38:51.100 --> 38:54.360
 which collects all of our sensory experience in parallel,

38:54.360 --> 38:56.540
 hearing, touch, smell, et cetera,

38:56.540 --> 38:58.360
 not so much smell through the thalamus I should mention,

38:58.360 --> 39:00.820
 but the other senses that is.

39:00.820 --> 39:04.300
 And then that thalamus is encased

39:04.300 --> 39:06.300
 by the thalamic reticular nucleus,

39:06.300 --> 39:08.260
 which serves as a kind of a guard

39:08.260 --> 39:09.820
 saying you can pass through and you can pass through,

39:09.820 --> 39:12.020
 but you, you, you can't pass through

39:12.020 --> 39:15.220
 up to conscious understanding and perception.

39:15.220 --> 39:18.540
 So that loop, this corticostriatal thalamic loop,

39:18.540 --> 39:20.580
 corticostriatal thalamic loop

39:20.580 --> 39:24.540
 is the circuit thought to underlie OCD

39:24.540 --> 39:26.380
 and dysfunction in that circuit

39:26.380 --> 39:28.260
 is what's thought to underlie OCD.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.900
 Now, again, the circuit exists in all of us

39:29.900 --> 39:31.220
 and it can operate in healthy ways

39:31.220 --> 39:33.420
 or it can operate in ways that make us feel unhealthy

39:33.420 --> 39:36.460
 or even suffer from full blown OCD.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.640
 How do we know that this circuit is involved in OCD?

39:39.640 --> 39:42.780
 Well, there we can look to some really interesting studies

39:42.780 --> 39:46.660
 that involve bringing human subjects into the laboratory

39:46.660 --> 39:48.980
 and generating their obsessions and compulsions

39:48.980 --> 39:51.620
 and then imaging their brain using any variety of techniques

39:51.620 --> 39:53.660
 that we talked about before.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.180
 What would such an experiment look like?

39:55.180 --> 39:57.580
 Well, in order to do that sort of experiment,

39:57.580 --> 40:00.700
 first of all, you need people who have OCD

40:00.700 --> 40:02.880
 and of course you need control subjects that don't

40:02.880 --> 40:05.800
 and you need to be able to reliably evoke the obsessions

40:05.800 --> 40:06.740
 and the compulsions.

40:06.740 --> 40:08.620
 Now it turns out this is most easily,

40:08.620 --> 40:10.980
 or I should say most simply done

40:10.980 --> 40:12.860
 because it can't be easy for the people with OCD,

40:12.860 --> 40:15.180
 but this is most straightforward.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.260
 That's the word I was looking for.

40:16.260 --> 40:19.640
 Most straightforward when looking at the category

40:19.640 --> 40:21.340
 of obsessions and compulsions

40:21.340 --> 40:25.060
 that relate to order and cleanliness.

40:25.060 --> 40:27.500
 So what they do typically is bring subjects

40:27.500 --> 40:30.380
 into the laboratory who have a obsession

40:30.380 --> 40:32.660
 about germs and contamination

40:32.660 --> 40:34.900
 and a compulsion to hand wash.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.660
 And they give these people, believe it or not,

40:37.660 --> 40:40.980
 a sweaty towel that contains the sweat

40:40.980 --> 40:45.000
 and the odor and the liquid basically

40:45.000 --> 40:46.460
 from somebody else's hands.

40:46.460 --> 40:48.740
 In fact, they'll sometimes have someone wipe

40:48.740 --> 40:50.820
 their own sweat off the back of their neck

40:50.820 --> 40:51.660
 and put it on the towel

40:51.660 --> 40:53.720
 and then they'll put it in front of the person,

40:53.720 --> 40:55.580
 which as you can imagine for someone with OCD

40:55.580 --> 40:57.980
 is incredibly anxiety provoking

40:57.980 --> 41:01.300
 and almost always evokes these obsessions about,

41:01.300 --> 41:05.000
 oh, this is really bad, this is really bad,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.360
 I need to clean, I need to clean, I need to clean.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.620
 Now they're doing all this while someone

41:08.620 --> 41:11.360
 is in a brain scanner or while they're being imaged

41:11.360 --> 41:13.180
 for positron emission tomography.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.780
 And then they can also look at the patterns of activation

41:15.780 --> 41:18.980
 in the brain while the person is doing hand washing.

41:18.980 --> 41:20.980
 Although sometimes the apparatus associated

41:20.980 --> 41:22.300
 with these imaging studies make it hard

41:22.300 --> 41:23.300
 to do a lot of movement,

41:23.300 --> 41:25.320
 they can do these sorts of studies.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.580
 They have done these sorts of studies in many subjects

41:28.580 --> 41:31.620
 using different variations of what I just described.

41:31.620 --> 41:34.700
 And lo and behold, what lights up, when I say lights up,

41:34.700 --> 41:39.020
 what sorts of brain regions are more metabolically active,

41:39.020 --> 41:40.500
 more blood flow, more neural activity?

41:40.500 --> 41:44.820
 Well, it's this particular corticostriatal thalamic loop.

41:44.820 --> 41:47.700
 In addition to that, some of the drug treatments

41:47.700 --> 41:49.220
 that are effective in some,

41:49.220 --> 41:51.440
 and I want to emphasize some individuals

41:51.440 --> 41:54.300
 at suppressing obsessions and or compulsions

41:54.300 --> 41:57.420
 such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

41:57.420 --> 41:59.860
 or SSRIs, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

42:01.180 --> 42:02.920
 When people take those drugs,

42:02.920 --> 42:04.980
 they see not just a suppression

42:04.980 --> 42:08.420
 of the obsession and compulsion,

42:08.420 --> 42:12.300
 but also a suppression of these particular neural circuits.

42:12.300 --> 42:13.580
 They become less active.

42:13.580 --> 42:15.740
 Now I want to emphasize and telegraph

42:15.740 --> 42:18.380
 a little bit of what's coming later.

42:18.380 --> 42:22.020
 These drugs like SSRIs do not work for everybody with OCD.

42:22.020 --> 42:23.040
 And as many of you know,

42:23.040 --> 42:25.480
 they carry other certain problems and side effects

42:25.480 --> 42:28.060
 for many, but not all individuals.

42:28.060 --> 42:31.260
 But nonetheless, what we have now is an observation

42:31.260 --> 42:33.680
 that this circuit, the corticostriatal thalamic loop,

42:33.680 --> 42:35.020
 is active in OCD.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.100
 We have a manipulation that when people take a drug

42:38.100 --> 42:40.100
 that at least in those individuals is effective

42:40.100 --> 42:42.780
 in suppressing or eliminating the obsessions and compulsions

42:42.780 --> 42:44.860
 there's less activity in this loop.

42:44.860 --> 42:47.580
 And thanks to some very good animal model studies

42:47.580 --> 42:49.140
 that at least at this point in time

42:49.140 --> 42:51.060
 you really couldn't do in humans,

42:51.060 --> 42:53.060
 although soon that may change,

42:53.060 --> 42:57.320
 we now know in a causal way that the equivalent circuitry,

42:57.320 --> 42:59.820
 A, exists in other animals,

42:59.820 --> 43:02.180
 such as mice, such as cats, such as monkeys.

43:02.180 --> 43:05.820
 And that activation of those particular

43:05.820 --> 43:09.640
 corticostriatal thalamic circuits in animal models

43:09.640 --> 43:13.220
 can indeed evoke OCD in an individual

43:13.220 --> 43:16.220
 that prior to that did not have OCD.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.220
 So I'm just going to briefly describe one study.

43:18.220 --> 43:21.640
 This is a now classic study published in the journal Science,

43:21.640 --> 43:24.780
 one of the three apex journals in 2013.

43:24.780 --> 43:28.380
 The first author on this paper is Suzanne Amari,

43:28.380 --> 43:30.340
 A-H-M-A-R-I.

43:30.340 --> 43:32.200
 I will provide a link to this in the show notes.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.060
 It's a truly landmark paper

43:34.060 --> 43:37.400
 done in Renee Hen's lab at Columbia University.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.500
 And the title of the paper is

43:38.500 --> 43:41.380
 Repeated Corticostriatal Stimulation Generates,

43:41.380 --> 43:42.220
 that's the key word here,

43:42.220 --> 43:45.280
 Generates Persistent OCD-Like Behavior.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.020
 What they did is they took mice,

43:47.020 --> 43:49.780
 mice do mouse things, they move around,

43:49.780 --> 43:52.560
 they play with toys, they eat, they pee, they mate,

43:52.560 --> 43:55.820
 they do various things in their cage, but they also groom.

43:55.820 --> 43:59.420
 Humans groom, animals with fur groom.

43:59.420 --> 44:02.140
 Well, you hope most people groom, some people overgroom,

44:02.140 --> 44:04.040
 some people undergroom, but most people groom.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.900
 They'll comb their hair, they'll clean, et cetera.

44:05.900 --> 44:08.760
 Those are normal behaviors that humans engage in.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.860
 I'm not aware that mice comb their hair,

44:09.860 --> 44:11.080
 but mice adjust their hair.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.880
 So they'll kind of pet their hair and they'll do this.

44:12.880 --> 44:14.620
 They'll sometimes even do it to each other.

44:14.620 --> 44:15.660
 We used to have mice in the lab.

44:15.660 --> 44:16.940
 Now we only do human studies,

44:16.940 --> 44:19.820
 but the mice will groom themselves.

44:19.820 --> 44:22.340
 And typical, what we call wild type mice,

44:22.340 --> 44:24.580
 not because they're wild, but because they're typical,

44:24.580 --> 44:27.640
 will groom themselves at a particular frequency,

44:27.640 --> 44:30.020
 but not to the point where their hair is falling out,

44:30.020 --> 44:31.020
 not constantly.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.100
 They are grooming some of the time

44:33.100 --> 44:36.660
 and they're doing other mouse things, other mouse times.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.060
 So in this particular study,

44:38.060 --> 44:41.020
 what they did is they used some technology,

44:41.020 --> 44:43.580
 which actually was discussed on a previous episode

44:43.580 --> 44:44.980
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

44:44.980 --> 44:47.380
 This is technology that was developed by a psychiatrist

44:47.380 --> 44:49.300
 and bioengineer by the name of Karl Deisseroth,

44:49.300 --> 44:52.280
 one of my colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.220
 This is technology that allows researchers

44:54.220 --> 44:58.740
 to use the presentation of light to control neural activity

44:58.740 --> 45:03.180
 in particular brain areas in a very high fidelity way.

45:03.180 --> 45:05.620
 You control the activity in the cortex or the striatum

45:05.620 --> 45:07.780
 or the thalamus when you want and how you want.

45:07.780 --> 45:09.620
 It's really a beautiful technology.

45:09.620 --> 45:11.980
 In any event, what they did in this study is,

45:11.980 --> 45:14.300
 or I should say what Susan Amari and colleagues did

45:14.300 --> 45:19.300
 in the study, was to stimulate the corticostriatal circuitry

45:20.260 --> 45:22.900
 in animals that did not have any OCD-like behavior.

45:22.900 --> 45:24.140
 And when they did that,

45:24.140 --> 45:26.420
 those animals started grooming incessantly

45:26.420 --> 45:28.300
 to the point where their hair was falling out

45:28.300 --> 45:29.400
 or they even, you know,

45:29.400 --> 45:31.300
 they didn't take the experiments this far, fortunately,

45:31.300 --> 45:32.840
 but the animals would have a tendency

45:32.840 --> 45:34.540
 to almost rub themselves raw.

45:34.540 --> 45:37.020
 In the same way that somebody who has a compulsion

45:37.020 --> 45:40.220
 to hand wash would, sadly, people will hand wash

45:40.220 --> 45:42.460
 to the point where their hands are actually bleeding and raw.

45:42.460 --> 45:43.580
 It's really that bad.

45:43.580 --> 45:45.580
 I know that's tough imagery to imagine.

45:45.580 --> 45:47.440
 And you can't even imagine why someone would self-harm

45:47.440 --> 45:48.280
 in that way.

45:48.280 --> 45:51.580
 But again, that's that incredible anxiety relationship

45:51.580 --> 45:53.020
 between the compulsion, excuse me,

45:53.020 --> 45:54.900
 the obsession and the compulsion,

45:54.900 --> 45:57.580
 and the fact that engaging in the compulsion

45:57.580 --> 46:00.580
 simply strengthens the obsession and therefore the anxiety.

46:00.580 --> 46:04.580
 So that collection of studies, of data,

46:04.580 --> 46:08.340
 fMRI, PET scanning in humans, the treatment with SSRIs,

46:08.340 --> 46:11.980
 and these experiments where researchers

46:11.980 --> 46:15.740
 have actively triggered these particular circuits

46:15.740 --> 46:18.740
 in animal models that previously did not have

46:18.740 --> 46:20.020
 too much activity in these circuits,

46:20.020 --> 46:24.620
 and then they observe OCD emerging really points squarely

46:24.620 --> 46:27.460
 to the fact that the corticosteroidal thalamic loop

46:27.460 --> 46:30.320
 is likely to be the basis of OCD.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.900
 Now, of course, other circuits could also be involved,

46:32.900 --> 46:35.460
 but the corticosteroidal thalamic circuit

46:35.460 --> 46:39.340
 seems to be the main circuit generating OCD-like behavior.

46:39.340 --> 46:40.660
 That's a lot of mechanism.

46:40.660 --> 46:42.560
 Hopefully, it was described in a way

46:42.560 --> 46:44.380
 that you can digest and understand.

46:44.380 --> 46:46.540
 And some of you might be thinking, well, so what?

46:46.540 --> 46:47.380
 Why does that help me?

46:47.380 --> 46:50.060
 I can't reach into my brain and turn off my cortex.

46:50.060 --> 46:52.620
 I can't reach into my brain and turn off my thalamus.

46:52.620 --> 46:55.460
 And indeed, on the one hand, that's true.

46:55.460 --> 46:57.420
 But as you'll next learn,

46:57.420 --> 46:59.740
 when thinking about the various behavioral treatments

46:59.740 --> 47:03.540
 and drug treatments and holistic treatments for OCD,

47:03.540 --> 47:05.460
 what you'll notice is that each one taps

47:05.460 --> 47:06.820
 into a different component

47:06.820 --> 47:09.740
 of this corticosteroidal thalamic loop.

47:09.740 --> 47:11.660
 And by understanding that,

47:11.660 --> 47:14.540
 you can start to see why certain treatments might work

47:14.540 --> 47:17.280
 at one stage of the illness versus others.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.340
 You will also start to understand why obsessive-compulsive

47:20.340 --> 47:23.980
 personality disorder does not have the same sorts

47:23.980 --> 47:25.940
 of engagements of these neural loops,

47:25.940 --> 47:30.260
 and yet relies on other aspects of brain and body,

47:30.260 --> 47:33.700
 and therefore, responds best to other sorts of treatments.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.380
 Or in some cases,

47:35.380 --> 47:37.820
 people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

47:37.820 --> 47:40.300
 are not even seeking treatment, as I alluded to before.

47:40.300 --> 47:41.760
 The point here is that by understanding

47:41.760 --> 47:43.180
 the underlying mechanism,

47:43.180 --> 47:45.940
 why certain drugs and behavioral treatments work

47:45.940 --> 47:48.120
 and don't work will become immediately apparent.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.220
 And in thinking about that,

47:50.220 --> 47:53.420
 in knowing that, you'll be able to make excellent choices,

47:53.420 --> 47:56.180
 I believe, in terms of what sorts of treatments you pursue,

47:56.180 --> 47:57.880
 what sorts of treatments you abandon,

47:57.880 --> 48:00.720
 and most importantly, the order,

48:00.720 --> 48:04.000
 the sequence that you pursue and apply those treatments.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.060
 Before we go any further,

48:05.060 --> 48:07.140
 I'd like to give people a little bit of a window

48:07.140 --> 48:10.840
 into what a diagnosis for OCD would look like.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.060
 Give you a sense of the sorts of questions

48:13.060 --> 48:15.020
 that a clinician would ask

48:15.020 --> 48:18.100
 to determine whether or not somebody has OCD or not.

48:18.100 --> 48:18.920
 Now, I want to be clear,

48:18.920 --> 48:20.620
 I'm not going to do this in an exhaustive way.

48:20.620 --> 48:22.580
 I wouldn't want anyone to self-diagnose,

48:22.580 --> 48:24.660
 although I'm hoping that by sharing some of this,

48:24.660 --> 48:26.000
 that some of you might get insight

48:26.000 --> 48:28.660
 into whether or not you do have obsessions and compulsions

48:28.660 --> 48:30.820
 that might qualify for OCD

48:30.820 --> 48:33.260
 and perhaps even to seek out help.

48:33.260 --> 48:37.540
 The most commonly used test of OCD,

48:37.540 --> 48:38.880
 or for OCD, I should say,

48:38.880 --> 48:41.940
 is called the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.

48:41.940 --> 48:44.580
 And this is, you know, scientists love acronyms,

48:44.580 --> 48:46.900
 as do the military, and it's the Y box,

48:46.900 --> 48:51.340
 the Y-B-O-C-S, the Y box.

48:51.340 --> 48:53.680
 So typically, someone will go into the clinic,

48:53.680 --> 48:55.740
 either because a family member encouraged them to

48:55.740 --> 48:57.620
 or because they feel that they're suffering

48:57.620 --> 48:59.460
 from obsessions and compulsions.

48:59.460 --> 49:02.420
 And before the clinician would proceed

49:02.420 --> 49:03.980
 with any kind of direct questions,

49:03.980 --> 49:05.520
 they would very clearly define

49:05.520 --> 49:06.900
 what obsessions and compulsions are.

49:06.900 --> 49:09.160
 And here I'm actually reading from the Y box.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.000
 So, quote,

49:10.000 --> 49:11.660
 obsessions are unwelcome in distressing ideas,

49:11.660 --> 49:13.060
 thoughts, images, or impulses

49:13.060 --> 49:14.440
 that repeatedly enter your mind.

49:14.440 --> 49:16.540
 They may seem to occur against your will.

49:16.540 --> 49:17.820
 They may be repugnant to you.

49:17.820 --> 49:19.500
 You may recognize them as senseless,

49:19.500 --> 49:22.320
 and they may not fit your personality.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.740
 Then there are compulsions.

49:23.740 --> 49:25.540
 Quote, compulsions, on the other hand,

49:25.540 --> 49:27.660
 are behaviors or acts that you feel driven to perform,

49:27.660 --> 49:30.900
 although you may recognize them as senseless or excessive.

49:30.900 --> 49:32.880
 At times, you may try to resist doing them,

49:32.880 --> 49:34.220
 but this may prove difficult.

49:34.220 --> 49:36.700
 You may experience anxiety that does not diminish

49:36.700 --> 49:38.380
 until the behavior is completed.

49:38.380 --> 49:39.300
 And as I mentioned before,

49:39.300 --> 49:42.280
 in many cases, immediately after the behavior is completed,

49:42.280 --> 49:45.580
 the anxiety doesn't just return, it indeed can strengthen.

49:45.580 --> 49:46.860
 Now, there are a tremendous number of questions

49:46.860 --> 49:47.700
 on the Y box.

49:47.700 --> 49:49.640
 So, I'm just going to highlight

49:49.640 --> 49:51.220
 a few of the general categories.

49:52.140 --> 49:54.740
 Typically, the person will fill out a checklist.

49:54.740 --> 49:58.080
 So, they will designate whether or not currently

49:58.080 --> 50:00.860
 or in the past, they have, for instance,

50:00.860 --> 50:02.180
 aggressive obsessions,

50:02.180 --> 50:04.180
 fear that one might harm themselves,

50:04.180 --> 50:05.860
 fear that one might harm others,

50:05.860 --> 50:07.060
 fear that they'll steal things,

50:07.060 --> 50:09.880
 fear that they will act on unwanted impulses,

50:09.880 --> 50:12.020
 currently or in the past or both.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.100
 That's one category.

50:13.100 --> 50:14.820
 The other one are contamination obsessions.

50:14.820 --> 50:16.500
 So, concern with dirt or germs,

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
 bothered by sticky substances or residues,

50:18.500 --> 50:19.560
 et cetera, et cetera.

50:19.560 --> 50:22.060
 So, a bunch of different categories that include,

50:22.060 --> 50:24.280
 for instance, sexual obsessions,

50:24.280 --> 50:26.460
 what are called saving obsessions,

50:26.460 --> 50:28.420
 even moral obsessions, right?

50:28.420 --> 50:30.860
 Excess concern with right or wrong or morality,

50:30.860 --> 50:33.900
 concerned with sacrilege and blasphemy,

50:33.900 --> 50:35.780
 obsession with need for symmetry and exactness.

50:35.780 --> 50:37.720
 Again, all of these questions being answered

50:37.720 --> 50:40.980
 as either present in the past or not present in the past,

50:40.980 --> 50:43.340
 present currently or not present currently.

50:43.340 --> 50:47.580
 And then the test generally transitions over

50:47.580 --> 50:49.820
 to questions about target symptoms.

50:49.820 --> 50:52.040
 They're really trying to get people to identify

50:52.040 --> 50:54.620
 if they have obsessions, what are their exact obsessions?

50:54.620 --> 50:56.160
 Now, this turns out to be really important

50:56.160 --> 50:58.140
 because as we talk about some of the therapies

50:58.140 --> 50:59.860
 that really work,

50:59.860 --> 51:03.140
 I'll just give away a little bit of why they work best

51:03.140 --> 51:05.460
 in certain cases and why they don't work as well

51:05.460 --> 51:06.760
 in other cases,

51:06.760 --> 51:09.360
 it turns out that it becomes very important

51:09.360 --> 51:11.300
 for the clinician and the patient

51:11.300 --> 51:13.840
 to not just identify the obsessions

51:13.840 --> 51:15.460
 and the compulsions generally

51:15.460 --> 51:17.980
 in a kind of a generic or top contour way,

51:17.980 --> 51:21.180
 but to really encourage or even force the patient

51:21.180 --> 51:23.900
 to define very precisely

51:23.900 --> 51:27.480
 what the biggest, most catastrophic fear is,

51:27.480 --> 51:29.720
 what the obsession really relates to.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.380
 That turns out to be very important

51:31.380 --> 51:34.440
 in disrupting this corticostriatal thalamic loop

51:34.440 --> 51:37.620
 and getting relief from symptoms one way or the other.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.940
 So the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale,

51:39.940 --> 51:42.380
 this Y box, again, is very extensive.

51:42.380 --> 51:45.660
 It goes on for dozens of pages actually

51:45.660 --> 51:47.960
 and has all these different categories,

51:47.960 --> 51:50.760
 not so much designed to just pinpoint

51:50.760 --> 51:54.740
 what people obsess about or what they feel compelled to do,

51:54.740 --> 51:56.860
 but to also try and identify

51:56.860 --> 51:59.940
 what is the fear that's driving all this, right?

51:59.940 --> 52:02.140
 In the way that we've set this up thus far,

52:02.140 --> 52:03.980
 we've been talking about obsessions and compulsions

52:03.980 --> 52:05.900
 as kind of existing in a vacuum.

52:05.900 --> 52:08.260
 You're obsessed about germs and you're compelled

52:08.260 --> 52:09.100
 to wash your hands,

52:09.100 --> 52:10.800
 obsessed about germs, compelled to wash your hands,

52:10.800 --> 52:12.160
 or obsessed about symmetry,

52:12.160 --> 52:14.200
 compelled to put right angles on everything,

52:14.200 --> 52:17.360
 or obsessed about counting and therefore counting, et cetera.

52:17.360 --> 52:21.380
 But beneath that is a cognitive component

52:21.380 --> 52:23.220
 that is not at all apparent

52:23.220 --> 52:26.260
 from someone describing their obsession

52:26.260 --> 52:29.520
 and from someone describing or displaying their compulsion.

52:29.520 --> 52:34.260
 The deeper layer to all that is what is the fear exactly

52:34.260 --> 52:37.780
 if one were to not perform the compulsion,

52:37.780 --> 52:41.060
 meaning what is the fear that's driving the obsession?

52:41.060 --> 52:45.340
 So that brings us to a very powerful category of treatments

52:45.340 --> 52:49.420
 that I should say does not work in everybody with OCD,

52:49.420 --> 52:51.980
 but works in many people with OCD

52:51.980 --> 52:56.260
 and really speaks to the underlying neural circuitry

52:56.260 --> 52:58.660
 that generates OCD and how to interrupt it.

52:58.660 --> 53:02.180
 And that is the treatment of cognitive behavioral therapy

53:02.180 --> 53:04.860
 and in particular exposure based cognitive

53:04.860 --> 53:06.620
 behavioral therapy.

53:06.620 --> 53:08.420
 So we're going to talk about cognitive behavioral therapy

53:08.420 --> 53:11.820
 and exposure therapy now, but right at the outset,

53:11.820 --> 53:14.020
 I want to distinguish the kinds of cognitive behavioral

53:14.020 --> 53:15.760
 therapy and exposure therapies that are done

53:15.760 --> 53:17.380
 for obsessive compulsive disorder,

53:17.380 --> 53:19.580
 the sorts of cognitive behavioral therapies that are done

53:19.580 --> 53:23.020
 for other types of mental challenges and disorders.

53:24.260 --> 53:27.480
 Because cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD

53:27.480 --> 53:30.160
 really has everything to do with identifying

53:30.160 --> 53:32.820
 the utmost fear.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.060
 In some sense, we can think of fears

53:34.060 --> 53:35.820
 as kind of along a hierarchy, right?

53:35.820 --> 53:38.420
 In the example earlier of somebody being afraid

53:38.420 --> 53:41.820
 to turn left and therefore feeling compelled to turn right,

53:41.820 --> 53:44.600
 you would want to take that person and really understand

53:44.600 --> 53:47.420
 what do they fear most about turning left?

53:47.420 --> 53:48.980
 Now they might not be aware of it.

53:48.980 --> 53:51.340
 They might not be conscious to what that really is,

53:51.340 --> 53:53.660
 but if you were to probe them in a clinical setting,

53:53.660 --> 53:55.060
 you would eventually get to an answer.

53:55.060 --> 53:58.420
 That answer could be at first, I don't know,

53:58.420 --> 53:59.280
 it's just bad.

53:59.280 --> 54:01.220
 I don't know why it's bad, it makes no sense,

54:01.220 --> 54:03.380
 but it's just bad, I do not want to go left.

54:03.380 --> 54:04.800
 I don't know why, I don't know why.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.040
 But if you were to push that person a little bit

54:07.040 --> 54:10.500
 in a respectful and kind and caring way aimed

54:10.500 --> 54:11.900
 at their treatment, if you were to push them and say,

54:11.900 --> 54:13.620
 well, what do you mean by bad?

54:13.620 --> 54:16.180
 If you turn left, do you think the world would end?

54:16.180 --> 54:17.800
 They might say, no, the world's not going to end,

54:17.800 --> 54:20.940
 but someone is going to die suddenly.

54:20.940 --> 54:22.820
 I know that sounds crazy, but somebody's going to die

54:22.820 --> 54:25.700
 suddenly, this almost sounds like superstition.

54:25.700 --> 54:26.980
 We'll talk about superstitions later,

54:26.980 --> 54:29.340
 but indeed it is somewhat superstitious.

54:29.340 --> 54:32.020
 So for instance, you would say, who's going to die?

54:32.020 --> 54:33.620
 And they'd say, I don't know.

54:33.620 --> 54:35.820
 And you'd say, no, really, who's going to die?

54:35.820 --> 54:37.420
 If you think about this, are you going to die?

54:37.420 --> 54:38.420
 Is so-and-so going to die?

54:38.420 --> 54:43.020
 And very often, very often, what you find is that

54:43.020 --> 54:48.020
 people will start to reveal the underlying obsession

54:48.580 --> 54:51.580
 at a level of detail that both to the clinician

54:51.580 --> 54:53.340
 and to them can be somewhat astonishing,

54:53.340 --> 54:55.140
 even though they've been living with that detail

54:55.140 --> 54:57.220
 in their mind for a very long time.

54:57.220 --> 54:59.140
 Now, how could somebody start to reveal detail

54:59.140 --> 55:00.780
 about something that's existed in their mind

55:00.780 --> 55:04.180
 for a very long time, but not known about it, right?

55:04.180 --> 55:05.420
 Not been aware of it.

55:05.420 --> 55:06.300
 Now, some of you might think,

55:06.300 --> 55:07.980
 oh, it's repressed or something.

55:07.980 --> 55:10.300
 That's not at all what's happening.

55:10.300 --> 55:12.580
 If you think about the architecture of OCD,

55:12.580 --> 55:14.460
 typically people will have an obsession

55:14.460 --> 55:16.100
 and then they'll engage in the compulsion

55:16.100 --> 55:18.620
 as quickly as they can to relieve that obsession.

55:18.620 --> 55:21.540
 So in many ways, the disease itself prevents people

55:21.540 --> 55:24.500
 from ever getting to the bottom of that trough,

55:24.500 --> 55:25.460
 ever getting to the point

55:25.460 --> 55:27.960
 where they really clearly articulate to themselves

55:27.960 --> 55:30.540
 exactly what it is that they fear.

55:30.540 --> 55:33.420
 But it becomes so essential to articulate

55:33.420 --> 55:35.900
 exactly what it is that they fear

55:35.900 --> 55:37.800
 for a somewhat counterintuitive reason.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.020
 You might think, oh, the moment they realize

55:40.020 --> 55:42.480
 exactly what they fear, everything lifts.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.340
 The circuit turns off and they just feel better

55:44.340 --> 55:45.820
 because they realized it.

55:45.820 --> 55:47.040
 I wish I could tell you that's the case,

55:47.040 --> 55:48.820
 but it turns out it's the opposite.

55:48.820 --> 55:51.140
 What the clinician is actually trying to do

55:51.140 --> 55:55.180
 is get people to feel more anxiety, not less.

55:55.180 --> 55:56.300
 What they're trying to get them to do

55:56.300 --> 55:59.360
 is to short circuit, no pun intended,

55:59.360 --> 56:02.860
 to intervene in their own neural circuit, I should say,

56:02.860 --> 56:06.740
 with that relief of anxiety, however brief,

56:06.740 --> 56:09.340
 brought on by engaging in the compulsion

56:09.340 --> 56:10.700
 related to the obsession.

56:10.700 --> 56:14.380
 So whereas typically someone would feel the obsession

56:14.380 --> 56:16.220
 with, oh, I don't want to turn left

56:16.220 --> 56:17.300
 because something bad's going to happen,

56:17.300 --> 56:19.700
 someone's going to die, and then they turn right,

56:19.700 --> 56:22.620
 they never get the option or the opportunity

56:22.620 --> 56:26.600
 to really explore what would happen were they to turn left

56:26.600 --> 56:28.500
 or to not be able to turn right.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.980
 By forcing them down the path of inquiry,

56:30.980 --> 56:32.220
 that leads them to the place

56:32.220 --> 56:37.180
 where they very clearly identify the fear, the anxiety.

56:37.180 --> 56:39.500
 It raises the anxiety in them,

56:39.500 --> 56:43.660
 and that's actually what the clinician is after.

56:43.660 --> 56:47.060
 Cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy

56:47.060 --> 56:50.060
 in the context of OCD most often involves

56:50.060 --> 56:54.880
 trying to get people to tolerate, not relieve their anxiety.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.300
 This is extremely important,

56:56.300 --> 56:58.580
 and I realize there's variation to this

56:58.580 --> 57:01.580
 depending on the style of cognitive behavioral therapy,

57:01.580 --> 57:05.460
 the style of exposure therapy, but almost across the board,

57:05.460 --> 57:09.500
 the goal, again, is to get people to feel the anxiety

57:09.500 --> 57:12.820
 that normally they are able to at least partially relieve,

57:12.820 --> 57:15.820
 however briefly, by engaging in the compulsion.

57:15.820 --> 57:18.140
 So if we think back to that circuit

57:18.140 --> 57:21.100
 of corticostriatal thalamic, what's going on here?

57:21.100 --> 57:23.420
 Where is CBT intervening?

57:23.420 --> 57:26.340
 What part of the circuit is getting interrupted?

57:26.340 --> 57:27.180
 Well, as you recall,

57:27.180 --> 57:29.340
 the cortex is involved in conscious perception,

57:29.340 --> 57:31.580
 the thalamus and that thalamic reticular nucleus

57:31.580 --> 57:36.100
 are involved in the passage of certain types of experience

57:36.100 --> 57:38.060
 up to our conscious perception, not others,

57:38.060 --> 57:39.180
 and the striatum is involved

57:39.180 --> 57:42.420
 in this go, no-go type behavior.

57:42.420 --> 57:47.220
 When OCD is really expressing itself in its fullness,

57:47.220 --> 57:50.120
 people feel an anxiety around a particular thought,

57:50.120 --> 57:54.620
 and they either have a go, for instance, wash hands,

57:54.620 --> 57:58.500
 or a no-go, do not turn left type reaction.

57:59.740 --> 58:03.560
 By having people progressively in a kind of hierarchical way

58:03.560 --> 58:06.580
 reveal their precise source of anxiety,

58:06.580 --> 58:08.740
 their utmost fear in this context,

58:09.580 --> 58:12.040
 what happens is they feel enormous amounts

58:12.040 --> 58:13.800
 of autonomic arousal.

58:13.800 --> 58:16.360
 Now, in the context of anxiety treatment

58:16.360 --> 58:17.620
 or other types of treatments,

58:17.620 --> 58:19.740
 the goal would be to teach people to dampen,

58:19.740 --> 58:22.320
 to lessen their anxiety through breathing techniques

58:22.320 --> 58:24.740
 or through visualization techniques

58:24.740 --> 58:27.200
 or through self-talk or through social support,

58:27.200 --> 58:28.920
 any of the number of things that are well known

58:28.920 --> 58:31.340
 to help people self-regulate their own anxiety.

58:31.340 --> 58:32.820
 Here, it's the opposite.

58:32.820 --> 58:35.060
 What they're trying to get the patient to do

58:35.060 --> 58:38.280
 is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum,

58:38.280 --> 58:40.100
 but then do the exact opposite

58:40.100 --> 58:41.780
 of whatever the normal compulsion is.

58:41.780 --> 58:44.260
 So if normally the compulsion is to wash one's hands,

58:44.260 --> 58:46.640
 then the idea is to suppress hand washing

58:46.640 --> 58:49.800
 while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.700
 Or in the case of not turning left,

58:52.700 --> 58:55.300
 the person is expected to,

58:55.300 --> 58:59.240
 or would hopefully be able to actually turn left.

59:00.580 --> 59:04.020
 And as you can imagine, that would evoke tremendous anxiety

59:04.020 --> 59:06.080
 and yet to tolerate that anxiety.

59:06.080 --> 59:06.960
 Now, I want to be very clear.

59:06.960 --> 59:08.920
 This is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.820
 This is not the sort of thing you want to do for a friend.

59:10.820 --> 59:14.420
 This is done by trained licensed psychologists

59:14.420 --> 59:15.940
 and psychiatrists.

59:15.940 --> 59:19.180
 But nonetheless, it really points to the fact

59:19.180 --> 59:22.500
 that as a anxiety-related disorder,

59:22.500 --> 59:25.620
 OCD is distinct from other types of anxiety

59:25.620 --> 59:27.600
 and anxiety-related disorders,

59:27.600 --> 59:30.380
 things like PTSD and panic disorder, et cetera,

59:30.380 --> 59:32.920
 because the goal again is to bring the person

59:32.920 --> 59:36.380
 right up close to the thing that they fear the most

59:36.380 --> 59:38.620
 and then to interrupt the circuit.

59:38.620 --> 59:42.620
 And now you should be able to know just intuitively,

59:42.620 --> 59:44.540
 because you understand the mechanisms,

59:44.540 --> 59:46.220
 that the circuit you're trying to disrupt

59:46.220 --> 59:49.300
 is the pattern of information flow

59:49.300 --> 59:50.960
 from the thinking part of the brain,

59:50.960 --> 59:51.980
 the perception part of the brain,

59:51.980 --> 59:55.200
 which is the cortex, to the striatum, right?

59:55.200 --> 59:58.520
 The striatum has these neurons which are active

59:58.520 --> 59:59.980
 that essentially are,

59:59.980 --> 1:00:00.800
 I know it sounds a little bit

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:02.040
 like a discussion about free will,

1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:03.620
 but they're trying to get the person

1:00:03.620 --> 1:00:04.860
 to generate a certain behavior

1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:06.780
 or suppress a certain behavior.

1:00:06.780 --> 1:00:08.260
 And as anxiety ramps up,

1:00:08.260 --> 1:00:11.700
 it's sort of a hydraulic pressure to do that very thing

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:12.780
 that they've done for so long

1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:14.600
 and they suffer from so much.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:16.020
 We talked about hydraulic pressure

1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:18.760
 in the context of aggression in the aggression episode.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:20.760
 This is very similar, right?

1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:23.460
 There's a kind of a, now when I say hydraulic pressure,

1:00:23.460 --> 1:00:24.860
 it's not actual hydraulic pressure.

1:00:24.860 --> 1:00:26.900
 It's the confluence of a lot of different systems.

1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:28.580
 It's neurochemical, as we'll soon learn.

1:00:28.580 --> 1:00:30.460
 It's hormonal, it's electrical.

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:32.820
 It's a lot of different things operating in parallel.

1:00:32.820 --> 1:00:35.420
 So we can't point to one chemical or transmitter.

1:00:35.420 --> 1:00:37.400
 What's happening is the person is feeling compelled

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:39.640
 to act, act, act to relieve the anxiety.

1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:43.400
 And through a progressive type of exposure, right?

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:45.020
 You don't throw people in the deep end

1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:47.480
 in this kind of therapy right off the bat.

1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:49.180
 You gradually ratchet them toward

1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:50.880
 or move them toward the discussion

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:52.380
 of exactly what they fear the most.

1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:54.060
 And then eventually move them toward

1:00:54.060 --> 1:00:56.240
 the interruption of the compulsion

1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:58.740
 as they're feeling this extremely elevated anxiety.

1:00:58.740 --> 1:00:59.880
 Of course, within the context

1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:02.560
 of a supportive clinical setting.

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:05.260
 But in doing that, what you are teaching people

1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:08.500
 is that the anxiety can exist without the need

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:10.100
 to engage in the compulsion.

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:12.860
 Now, some of this might sound to people like,

1:01:12.860 --> 1:01:14.260
 oh, this is a lot of the kind of fancy

1:01:14.260 --> 1:01:15.860
 psychological neuroscience speak

1:01:15.860 --> 1:01:17.360
 around something that's kind of intuitive.

1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:20.820
 But I think for most people, this is not intuitive.

1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:25.220
 And for people with OCD, there's no really other way

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:29.460
 to put it, the impulse, the compulsion to avoid anxiety

1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:31.740
 is such a powerful driving force

1:01:31.740 --> 1:01:33.020
 that it should now make sense to you

1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:35.740
 as to why being able to tolerate anxiety

1:01:35.740 --> 1:01:38.100
 and really sit with it and do the exact opposite

1:01:38.100 --> 1:01:39.680
 of what you're normally compelled to do

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:41.460
 is going to be the path to treatment.

1:01:41.460 --> 1:01:44.980
 And indeed CBT has been shown to be enormously effective,

1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:47.820
 again, for a large number of people with OCD,

1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:48.940
 but not all of them.

1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:52.340
 And oftentimes it requires that it also be used

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:54.180
 in concert with certain drug treatments,

1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:56.220
 which we're going to talk about in a moment.

1:01:56.220 --> 1:01:58.580
 Next, let's talk about some of the really unique features

1:01:58.580 --> 1:02:00.740
 of cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy

1:02:00.740 --> 1:02:04.300
 in the context of OCD that you often don't see

1:02:04.300 --> 1:02:08.260
 in the use of CBT, that is cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:12.020
 for other types of psychiatric challenges and disorders.

1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:15.360
 The first element is one of staircasing.

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:17.020
 And I already mentioned this before,

1:02:17.020 --> 1:02:22.020
 but this gradual and progressive increase in the anxiety

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.500
 that you're trying to evoke from the patient,

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:26.960
 from the person suffering from OCD.

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.060
 That's done in the context of the office or the laboratory,

1:02:31.060 --> 1:02:33.840
 again, by a trained and licensed clinician.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:36.760
 But then the person leaves, right?

1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:40.180
 They leave the office, they leave the laboratory.

1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:43.860
 And a very vital component of CBT and exposure therapy

1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:47.140
 for people with OCD is that they have and perform

1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:50.120
 what's called homework, is literally what they call.

1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:51.960
 This might be seen in other sorts of treatments,

1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:55.280
 but for OCD, homework is extremely important

1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:57.780
 because within the context of a laboratory experiment

1:02:57.780 --> 1:03:00.780
 or the clinic, patients often feel so much support

1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:02.900
 that they can tolerate those heightened levels of anxiety

1:03:02.900 --> 1:03:04.740
 and interrupt their compulsions.

1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:07.220
 Whereas when they get home, oftentimes the familiarity

1:03:07.220 --> 1:03:09.160
 of the environment brings them to a place

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:11.580
 where all of a sudden those obsessions and compulsions

1:03:11.580 --> 1:03:13.160
 start interacting the same way

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:16.620
 and they have a very hard time suppressing the behaviors.

1:03:16.620 --> 1:03:17.700
 Why would that be?

1:03:17.700 --> 1:03:20.300
 Well, in neuroscience, we have a phrase,

1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:21.980
 it's called condition place preference

1:03:21.980 --> 1:03:23.660
 and condition place avoidance.

1:03:23.660 --> 1:03:24.680
 There's some other phrases too,

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:27.700
 but basically it all has to do with a simple thing,

1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:30.740
 which is when you feel something repeatedly

1:03:30.740 --> 1:03:31.700
 in a given environment,

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.920
 or sometimes even once within a given environment,

1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:36.340
 you tend to feel that same thing again

1:03:36.340 --> 1:03:38.880
 when you return to that or similar environments, okay?

1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:41.280
 So condition place blank or condition place that

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:44.340
 is simply fancy nerd speak for the fact that

1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:46.340
 when you're in a place and something good happens,

1:03:46.340 --> 1:03:48.040
 you tend to feel good if you return to that place

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:48.980
 or a place like it,

1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:51.300
 or if something bad happens in a given place,

1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:53.560
 you tend to feel bad when you return to that place

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:54.860
 or a place like it.

1:03:54.860 --> 1:03:57.260
 I think the most salient example that leaps to mind

1:03:57.260 --> 1:03:58.940
 is in unfortunately the category of bad,

1:03:58.940 --> 1:04:02.420
 but I had some friends years ago visit San Francisco.

1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:03.680
 There's been a ongoing,

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:05.460
 it seems like it's been happening forever,

1:04:05.460 --> 1:04:08.140
 but this is really in the last decade of daytime break-ins

1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:12.220
 and nighttime break-ins into cars to steal anything

1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:14.600
 from computers to what seems to be like a box of tissues.

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:16.440
 And there are numerous reasons for this.

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:17.280
 I don't want to get into,

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:18.720
 it's not the topic of today's podcast,

1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.120
 but I will use this as an opportunity to say,

1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:21.960
 if you're visiting anywhere in the Bay Area,

1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:23.100
 do not leave anything in your car

1:04:23.100 --> 1:04:24.900
 because the window will get broken into

1:04:24.900 --> 1:04:26.380
 sometimes in broad daylight.

1:04:26.380 --> 1:04:28.460
 Some good friends of mine were visiting the Bay Area

1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:30.840
 and I texted them and said,

1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:32.900
 hey, by the way, when you're headed to dinner, guys,

1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:36.300
 make sure you bring in all your luggage and computers,

1:04:36.300 --> 1:04:38.340
 however inconvenient that might be.

1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:41.260
 They wrote back, too late, everything got stolen.

1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:42.300
 So some years ago now,

1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:44.620
 I think five, six years ago, this happened.

1:04:44.620 --> 1:04:46.580
 Sadly, everything got stolen.

1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:47.540
 Most of it could be replaced,

1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:49.620
 but some of it was very sentimental to them.

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:51.860
 Every time we talk,

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.300
 every time we consider having a meeting

1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:54.420
 in a particular city,

1:04:54.420 --> 1:04:56.640
 this comes up as I don't want to be there,

1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:58.260
 I don't like that city anymore, et cetera.

1:04:58.260 --> 1:04:59.800
 And of course, San Francisco has some wonderful

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:00.640
 redeeming features,

1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:03.560
 but it only takes one bad incident in one location

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:07.820
 to kind of color the whole picture dark, so to speak.

1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:09.060
 The brain works that way.

1:05:09.060 --> 1:05:10.620
 The brain generalizes.

1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:12.300
 It's not a very specific organ.

1:05:12.300 --> 1:05:15.020
 Again, it's a prediction machine in addition to other things.

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:17.780
 So in the case of CBT therapy,

1:05:17.780 --> 1:05:20.820
 the reason there's homework is that when people go home,

1:05:20.820 --> 1:05:23.420
 oftentimes that's when they relapse,

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:24.420
 if you want to call it that,

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:26.260
 back into their obsessions and compulsions.

1:05:26.260 --> 1:05:30.380
 And that location, that conditioned place

1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:31.940
 is where it becomes most important

1:05:31.940 --> 1:05:34.860
 to challenge the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety,

1:05:34.860 --> 1:05:36.400
 to not try and suppress the anxiety

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:38.860
 through compulsions or other means.

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:41.700
 And when I say other means, I want to highlight something.

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:43.780
 We'll come up again a little bit later in the podcast

1:05:43.780 --> 1:05:47.280
 that substance abuse is very common in people with OCD

1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:48.920
 because of the anxiety component

1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:50.760
 and also because of people's feelings

1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:52.660
 that they just can't escape from the thoughts

1:05:52.660 --> 1:05:57.000
 or behavioral patterns that are so characteristic of OCD.

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.340
 So alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse

1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:04.340
 or other forms of narcotics abuse are very common in OCD.

1:06:05.380 --> 1:06:07.180
 Later, we'll talk about whether or not cannabis can

1:06:07.180 --> 1:06:11.840
 or cannot help with OCD, but needless to say,

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:15.340
 suppressing anxiety is exactly the wrong direction

1:06:15.340 --> 1:06:19.400
 that one should take if the goal is to ultimately relieve

1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:21.480
 or eliminate the OCD.

1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:25.240
 So we now have two characteristics of CBT exposure therapy

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.000
 that are extremely important for OCD

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.060
 and somewhat unique to the treatment of OCD.

1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:31.660
 And that's the staircasing up towards the really bad fear,

1:06:31.660 --> 1:06:34.900
 the really severe and specific articulation

1:06:34.900 --> 1:06:37.700
 and understanding and feeling of how bad things really

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:40.540
 would be if someone engaged in a particular behavior

1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:42.000
 or avoided a particular behavior.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:43.920
 Then there's the component of homework

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:46.420
 given by the clinician for the person to be able

1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:49.540
 to create a broader set of contexts

1:06:49.540 --> 1:06:52.680
 in which they can deal with the anxiety,

1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:54.420
 not engage in the compulsions.

1:06:54.420 --> 1:06:57.660
 And then a very unique feature of treatment of OCD

1:06:57.660 --> 1:07:00.800
 that you don't see in many other psychiatric disorders

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:02.140
 are home visits.

1:07:02.140 --> 1:07:03.620
 I find this fascinating.

1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:06.500
 I think that the field of psychiatry and psychology

1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:10.700
 traditionally doesn't allow for or invite home visits,

1:07:10.700 --> 1:07:15.020
 but this component of context, location and context

1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:19.860
 being so vital to the treatment and relief of OCD

1:07:19.860 --> 1:07:23.620
 has inspired many psychiatrists and psychologists

1:07:23.620 --> 1:07:26.080
 to get permission to do home visits

1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:27.700
 where they actually go visit their patients

1:07:27.700 --> 1:07:30.180
 in their native setting, in their home cages, right?

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.760
 They're not mice, but in their home home cages, right?

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:34.340
 I'm being facetious here, but people,

1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:36.100
 mice live in cages, at least in the laboratory

1:07:36.100 --> 1:07:39.500
 and humans generally live in houses or elsewhere.

1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:42.420
 So they visit them in their home

1:07:42.420 --> 1:07:44.580
 in order to see how they're interacting

1:07:44.580 --> 1:07:47.700
 and the particular locations that evoke the most anxiety

1:07:47.700 --> 1:07:48.620
 and the least anxiety.

1:07:48.620 --> 1:07:50.540
 Some of the, I don't want to call them crutches,

1:07:50.540 --> 1:07:53.140
 but some of the tools that people are using

1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:56.900
 to confront and deal with the obsessions and compulsions

1:07:56.900 --> 1:07:59.140
 and in particular, to try and identify

1:07:59.140 --> 1:08:03.200
 some of the tools and tricks that people are using

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:05.320
 to try and avoid that heightened anxiety.

1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:07.740
 Because once again, and I know I'm repeating myself,

1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:10.140
 but I think this is just so vital and so unique

1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:12.460
 about OCD and the treatment of OCD,

1:08:12.460 --> 1:08:14.140
 the critical need for the patient

1:08:14.140 --> 1:08:18.180
 to be able to tolerate extremely elevated levels of anxiety

1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:20.140
 is so crucial.

1:08:20.140 --> 1:08:23.140
 So if people are avoiding certain rooms in the house,

1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:25.940
 or if people are avoiding certain foods

1:08:25.940 --> 1:08:27.640
 or certain locations in the kitchen,

1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:29.500
 the clinician can start to identify that

1:08:29.500 --> 1:08:31.200
 by mere observation.

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:33.420
 And I should mention here that patients

1:08:33.420 --> 1:08:36.680
 are not always aware of how they are interacting

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:37.780
 with their home environment.

1:08:37.780 --> 1:08:41.060
 Some of these patterns are so deeply ingrained in people

1:08:41.060 --> 1:08:42.200
 that they don't even realize

1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:44.100
 that they're constantly turning to the left

1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:45.180
 or they don't even realize

1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:46.700
 that they're only washing their hands

1:08:46.700 --> 1:08:47.760
 on one side of the sink.

1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:49.980
 And so the clinician by visiting the home

1:08:49.980 --> 1:08:52.680
 can start to interrogate a bit in a polite way,

1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:54.300
 in a friendly, in a supportive way

1:08:54.300 --> 1:08:57.560
 as to do you ever think about why you always

1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.140
 flip the faucet to the left

1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:01.480
 or flip the faucet to the right, et cetera.

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:05.740
 Now, we all do a lot of things that are habitual.

1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:10.080
 We all do things that are somewhat regular from day to day.

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.080
 In fact, I would invite you to ask yourself,

1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:16.480
 do you always put your toothbrush in the same location?

1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:19.360
 Do you always cap the toothbrush before or after you use it?

1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:22.620
 What sorts of things do you wipe the little threading

1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:23.540
 on the toothpaste or not?

1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:26.400
 I'm somebody, I confess that I have,

1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:28.720
 well, I have about 3,500 pet peeves,

1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:30.440
 but one of my pet peeves is toothpaste

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.520
 kind of on the thread of the toothpaste.

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:33.360
 It really bothers me.

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:34.200
 I don't know why.

1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:36.840
 Almost as much as trying to wipe it off bothers me,

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:38.160
 which creates a certain challenge.

1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:39.700
 And if I talk about this any further,

1:09:39.700 --> 1:09:40.740
 then I think I would qualify

1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:43.420
 for obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:44.260
 But I have to say,

1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:45.860
 I don't experience a ton of anxiety about it.

1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:47.000
 It doesn't govern my life.

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.680
 In fact, I realized that right now

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:50.640
 there are tubes of toothpaste

1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:52.160
 that have toothpaste along the thread

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:54.400
 everywhere in the world, and it doesn't really bother me.

1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:55.800
 I can still sit here

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.560
 and provide some information about OCD to you.

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:02.200
 It's not intrusive, at least not to my awareness.

1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:03.920
 So by the home visit,

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:06.060
 the therapist can really start to explore

1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:08.040
 through direct questioning

1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:09.780
 and can allow the patient to explore

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:11.440
 through direct questioning of themselves

1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:12.760
 the things that it might be conscious of

1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:15.220
 and the things that they might not be conscious of

1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:17.600
 that would qualify for OCD.

1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:20.200
 So I'd like to just briefly summarize the key elements

1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:23.340
 of cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy

1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.160
 and how they can be combined with drug treatments

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:27.360
 that are very effective.

1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:29.880
 Much of what I'm going to talk about next

1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:33.520
 relates to the data and indeed the practice

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:38.200
 of an incredible research scientist and clinician.

1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:40.080
 So this is Helen Blair Simpson,

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:42.080
 or I should say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:44.400
 because she is indeed an MD, medical doctor,

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.000
 and a PhD research scientist

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.180
 at Columbia University School of Medicine.

1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:53.500
 And one of the world's foremost experts, if not the expert,

1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:54.720
 I would put her in a category

1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:56.680
 of maybe just one to three people

1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:01.440
 who is most knowledgeable about the mechanisms of OCD,

1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:04.720
 is actively researching OCD in humans,

1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:06.120
 trying to find new treatments,

1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:08.720
 trying to unveil new mechanisms

1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.720
 and expand on our current understanding

1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:14.600
 and who also treats OCD quite actively in her own clinic.

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:19.280
 Dr. Simpson gave a beautiful presentation

1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:22.560
 in which she summarized some of the core elements of CBT

1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:23.720
 and exposure therapy

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:26.160
 for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders.

1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:29.280
 She describes that the key procedures are exposures,

1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:33.520
 of course, done in person and with the actual thing

1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:36.400
 that evokes the obsessions and compulsions.

1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:39.600
 So this could be the sweaty towel as described earlier,

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:42.960
 or could be any number of different triggers

1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:45.040
 done with the patient in real time.

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:47.040
 So in vivo, as we say.

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:50.240
 And it could also be things that are imaginal,

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:53.320
 sitting somebody down in a chair in an office and saying,

1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:55.940
 okay, I want you to imagine the thing

1:11:55.940 --> 1:11:57.320
 that triggers the intrusive thought,

1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:01.000
 or let's just focus on the intrusive thought as it arises

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.140
 and then to explore and expose the patient

1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:04.760
 to their obsessions and compulsions that way.

1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:06.880
 So it can be real or it can be imaginal.

1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:10.240
 And the goal of course then is to gradually

1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:12.420
 and progressively increase the level of anxiety,

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:15.360
 but then to intervene in so-called ritual prevention

1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:18.280
 to prevent the person from engaging in the compulsion.

1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.900
 The goals, again, I'm paraphrasing here,

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:22.640
 are to, as she states,

1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:26.840
 disconfirm fears and challenge the beliefs

1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:29.720
 about the obsessions and compulsions,

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.580
 to intervene in the thoughts and the behaviors,

1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:34.080
 and to break the habit of ritualizing and avoiding.

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:35.420
 Now, how is this typically done?

1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:38.440
 What are the nuts and bolts of this procedure?

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:42.280
 Typically, this is done through two planning sessions

1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:43.120
 with the patient.

1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:45.420
 So describing to the patient what will happen

1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:47.760
 and when it will happen and how long it will happen

1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:51.080
 so they're not just thrown into this out of the blue.

1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:55.680
 And then 15 exposure sessions done twice a week or more.

1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:57.080
 So the one thing to really understand

1:12:57.080 --> 1:12:58.480
 about cognitive behavioral therapy

1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:00.200
 is that it can take some period of time,

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:03.440
 several or more weeks, as many as 10 or 12 weeks.

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:05.120
 However, as you'll soon learn,

1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:06.880
 many of the drug treatments that are effective

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.760
 in treating OCD either alone

1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:10.860
 or in combination with behavioral therapies

1:13:10.860 --> 1:13:13.920
 also can take eight, 10, 12 weeks or longer,

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:16.040
 and many of those never work at all.

1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:17.720
 So even though 10 to 12 weeks

1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:19.120
 seems like a long period of time,

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:20.360
 it's actually pretty standard.

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:22.520
 If you'd like to see more complete description

1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:24.580
 of the protocols for cognitive behavioral therapy

1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:26.680
 and exposure therapy for OCD,

1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:28.260
 I'll provide links to two papers,

1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:32.280
 COSAC and FOA, F-O-A, which is published in 1997,

1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:33.540
 which might seem like a long time ago,

1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:36.480
 but nonetheless, the protocols are still very useful.

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:38.640
 And then the second paper is by that last author,

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.720
 Faux et al. in 2012,

1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:42.900
 and we'll provide links to both of those.

1:13:42.900 --> 1:13:46.960
 In addition, Dr. Blair Simpson and others have explored

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:50.360
 what are the best treatments for patients with OCD

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:54.240
 by comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone, placebo,

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:57.020
 so essentially no intervention,

1:13:57.020 --> 1:13:59.080
 or something that takes an equivalent amount of time

1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:03.040
 but is not thought to be effective in treatment,

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:07.340
 as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

1:14:07.340 --> 1:14:09.400
 So what is an SSRI?

1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:13.040
 An SSRI is a drug that prevents the reuptake

1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:14.780
 of serotonin at the synapse.

1:14:14.780 --> 1:14:15.620
 What are synapses?

1:14:15.620 --> 1:14:17.520
 They're the little spaces between neurons

1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:19.520
 where neurons communicate with one another

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:22.660
 by vomiting little bits of chemical into the space,

1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:25.200
 the synapse, and then those chemicals

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:27.840
 either evoke or suppress the electrical activity

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:30.680
 of the next neuron across the synapse.

1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:32.560
 And in this case, the neurotransmitter,

1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:34.960
 the chemical that we're referring to is serotonin.

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.640
 SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:42.960
 prevent the reuptake of the chemical that's left,

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:45.360
 in this case, the serotonin that's left in the synapse

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:48.080
 after that, I called it vomiting to be dramatic,

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.120
 but it's not actually a vomiting,

1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:52.640
 the extrusion of the chemical into the synapse.

1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:55.760
 And as a consequence, there's more serotonin around

1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:57.680
 to have more of an effect over time,

1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:00.640
 the net effect being more serotonergic transmission,

1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:02.640
 more serotonin overall.

1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:04.420
 So not more serotonin being made,

1:15:04.420 --> 1:15:06.840
 more serotonin being available for use.

1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:08.640
 That's what an SSRI does.

1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:13.400
 So they compared cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs,

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:14.640
 they also had the placebo group

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.160
 and they had cognitive behavioral therapy

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:19.920
 plus the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:22.640
 This was a 12-week study done as described before,

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:25.360
 two times a week over the course of 12 weeks.

1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:28.360
 First of all, the most important thing, of course,

1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:29.500
 placebo did nothing.

1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:34.500
 It did not relieve the OCD to any significant degree, right?

1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:35.640
 How did they know that?

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.160
 They gave them the Y-box test that we talked about before,

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:41.500
 the Yale-Brown test with all those questions

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:42.920
 of which I read a few.

1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.480
 So the OCD severity that one has to have on the Y-box

1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:51.160
 is measured in terms of an index that goes from any here

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:52.840
 from eight all the way up to 28,

1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:53.840
 that shouldn't mean anything.

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:55.860
 So the number eight is kind of meaningless here.

1:15:55.860 --> 1:15:58.240
 It's in terms of an index that's only meaningful

1:15:58.240 --> 1:15:59.420
 for the Y-box.

1:15:59.420 --> 1:16:02.720
 But if somebody has a threshold of 16 or higher,

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:04.080
 it means that they're still having

1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:05.400
 somewhat debilitating symptoms

1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:07.120
 or very debilitating symptoms.

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:10.400
 Placebo did not reduce the obsessions or compulsions

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.240
 to any significant degree.

1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:14.440
 However, and I think quite excitingly,

1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:19.000
 cognitive behavioral therapy had a dramatic effect

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.280
 in reducing the obsessions and compulsions

1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:25.120
 such that by four weeks, that score,

1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:27.240
 that in this case range from eight to 28,

1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:31.360
 dropped all the way from 25 down to about 11.

1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:35.160
 So it's a huge drop in the severity of the symptoms.

1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:36.560
 Now, what's really interesting

1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:39.440
 is that when you look at the effects of SSRIs

1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:42.860
 in the treatment of OCD symptoms,

1:16:42.860 --> 1:16:44.780
 they had a significant effect

1:16:44.780 --> 1:16:47.000
 in reducing the symptoms of OCD

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:48.740
 that showed up first at four weeks

1:16:48.740 --> 1:16:51.260
 and then continued to eight weeks.

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:54.400
 In fact, there was a progressive and further reduction

1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:57.080
 in OCD symptoms from the four to eight week period.

1:16:57.080 --> 1:16:59.920
 Again, these are the people just taking the SSRI.

1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:01.600
 And then it sort of flattened out a little bit

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:03.060
 such that by 12 weeks,

1:17:03.060 --> 1:17:05.720
 there was still a significant reduction in OCD symptoms

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:08.980
 for people taking SSRIs as compared to placebo.

1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:11.360
 But the severity of their symptoms

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:13.220
 was still much greater

1:17:13.220 --> 1:17:16.560
 than those receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone.

1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:18.120
 So at least in this study,

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:19.620
 and I should tell you which study it is.

1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:21.960
 This is Faux Leibowitz et al. 2005

1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:23.360
 in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:24.760
 We'll also provide a link to this

1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:27.020
 so you can peruse the data if you like.

1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:28.400
 But at least in this study,

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:31.320
 cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective.

1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:35.100
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective.

1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:36.680
 So what happens when you combine them?

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:38.120
 Well, they explored that as well.

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:40.600
 And the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy

1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:42.760
 and the SSRIs together

1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.420
 did not lead to any further decrease in OCD symptoms.

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:51.440
 This points to the idea that cognitive behavioral therapy

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:52.800
 is the most effective treatment.

1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:54.520
 And again, when I say cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:17:54.520 --> 1:17:56.480
 now I'm still referring to cognitive behavioral

1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:58.220
 slash exposure therapy

1:17:58.220 --> 1:17:59.580
 done in the way that I detailed before.

1:17:59.580 --> 1:18:01.900
 Twice a week for 12 weeks or more.

1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:03.660
 So all of the data, at least in this study,

1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:05.840
 point to the fact that cognitive behavioral therapy

1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:08.400
 is really effective and the most effective.

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:11.880
 Does it alleviate OCD symptoms for everybody?

1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:13.440
 No. Is it very time consuming?

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:17.700
 Yes. Twice a week for two sessions or more of 15 minutes,

1:18:17.700 --> 1:18:19.740
 sometimes in the office, plus there's homework,

1:18:19.740 --> 1:18:22.240
 plus in an ideal case, there's also home visits

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:24.200
 from the psychiatrist or psychologist.

1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:28.500
 That's a lot of investment, a lot of time investment

1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:31.560
 to say nothing of the potential financial investment.

1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:34.320
 Now, Dr. Blair Simpson has given some beautiful talks

1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:37.240
 where she describes these data

1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.720
 and also emphasizes the fact that

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:43.120
 despite the demonstrated power of cognitive behavioral

1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:45.120
 therapy for the treatment of OCD,

1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:46.560
 most people are given drug treatments

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:49.020
 simply because of the availability of those drug treatments.

1:18:49.020 --> 1:18:50.200
 Now, when I say most people,

1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:52.220
 I want to emphasize that I'm referring to

1:18:52.220 --> 1:18:54.720
 most people who actually go seek treatment

1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:56.780
 because a really important thing to realize

1:18:56.780 --> 1:18:58.680
 is that most people with OCD

1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:01.880
 do not actually go seek evidence-based treatment.

1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:02.700
 I want to repeat that.

1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:05.540
 Most people with OCD do not seek evidence-based treatment,

1:19:05.540 --> 1:19:06.800
 which is a tragic thing.

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:09.540
 One of the motivations for doing this podcast episode

1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:11.120
 is to try and encourage people

1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:13.160
 who think they may have persistent obsessions

1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:16.080
 and compulsions to seek treatment,

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:19.720
 but most people don't for a variety of reasons

1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:22.640
 we spelled out earlier, shame, et cetera.

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:25.320
 Of those that do, the first line of attack

1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:29.360
 is typically a prescription, most often an SSRI,

1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:31.320
 although not always just SSRIs

1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:35.440
 because soon we'll talk about the somewhat common use

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:39.240
 of also prescribing a low dose of a neuroleptic

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:42.560
 or an antipsychotic, not always, but often.

1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:44.760
 So the important thing to understand here

1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:47.520
 is that excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson

1:19:47.520 --> 1:19:49.880
 understand that while there are treatments

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:53.720
 that we could say are best or are ideal based on the data,

1:19:53.720 --> 1:19:56.680
 that doesn't necessarily mean that's what's being deployed

1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:58.640
 most often in the general public.

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:01.440
 As a consequence, Dr. Simpson and others

1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:04.480
 have explored in a very practical way

1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:05.800
 whether or not it matters

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:09.800
 if somebody is getting SSRI treatment

1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:14.240
 and is experiencing that reduction in OCD symptoms

1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:15.880
 that as you may recall

1:20:15.880 --> 1:20:19.900
 is more than what they would experience with placebo alone,

1:20:19.900 --> 1:20:22.420
 but not as dramatic a reduction in OCD symptoms

1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:25.040
 as they would get with cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:26.020
 And as I mentioned before,

1:20:26.020 --> 1:20:29.160
 there was this exploration of combining drug treatment

1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:31.440
 with cognitive behavioral therapy from the outset,

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:34.120
 but they also quite impressively explored

1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:37.240
 what happens when people who are already taking SSRIs

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.480
 initiate cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:41.720
 This is a really wonderful thing that they've done this

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:44.080
 because in doing that, first of all,

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:46.280
 they're acknowledging that there are many people out there

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:47.200
 who have sought treatment

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.780
 and are getting some relief from those SSRIs,

1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:52.560
 but it perhaps is not as much relief as they could get.

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:55.300
 And they are actively acknowledging

1:20:55.300 --> 1:20:58.240
 that many people are getting these drug treatments first.

1:20:58.240 --> 1:20:59.340
 In fact, most often people

1:20:59.340 --> 1:21:01.200
 are getting these drug treatments first.

1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:04.580
 So what happens when you add in cognitive behavioral therapy?

1:21:04.580 --> 1:21:05.420
 Well, the good news is

1:21:05.420 --> 1:21:07.960
 when you add cognitive behavioral therapy

1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:10.800
 to someone who's already taking SSRIs,

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:13.200
 that further improves their symptoms.

1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:16.280
 Now that's different than the results

1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:20.460
 that I described before from the same laboratory in fact,

1:21:20.460 --> 1:21:23.480
 that if you combine cognitive behavioral therapy

1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:25.600
 with SSRIs from the outset,

1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:28.260
 there's no additional benefit of SSRI.

1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:30.800
 However, as I just described,

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:33.000
 if someone is already taking an SSRI

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.340
 and they're experiencing a reduction in their OCD symptoms,

1:21:37.340 --> 1:21:40.060
 by adding in cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:21:40.060 --> 1:21:44.260
 there's a further reduction in the symptoms of OCD.

1:21:44.260 --> 1:21:45.100
 So it's very important.

1:21:45.100 --> 1:21:46.740
 So for those of you that have sought treatment

1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:49.060
 and you're taking a SSRI,

1:21:49.060 --> 1:21:50.420
 or if you're thinking about treatment

1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:52.060
 and you're prescribed an SSRI,

1:21:52.060 --> 1:21:53.480
 the ideal scenario really would be

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:55.000
 to combine the drug treatment

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.420
 with cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:58.780
 or in some cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone,

1:21:58.780 --> 1:22:00.920
 although that's a decision that you really have to make

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:05.920
 with the close advice and oversight of a licensed physician,

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:08.680
 because of course these are prescription drugs.

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:11.380
 And anytime you're going to add or remove a prescription drug

1:22:11.380 --> 1:22:13.320
 or change dosage, you really want to do that

1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:16.580
 in close discussion with and on the advice of your physician.

1:22:16.580 --> 1:22:17.680
 I don't just say that to protect me,

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:18.560
 I say that to protect you

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:20.640
 and because it's just the right thing to do.

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:23.860
 So again, cognitive behavioral therapy is extremely powerful.

1:22:23.860 --> 1:22:25.880
 Drug treatments seem less powerful,

1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:27.320
 though if you're already on a drug treatment,

1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:29.620
 adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really help.

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:30.980
 So I've been talking about SSRIs

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:32.520
 and described a little bit about how they work

1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:33.780
 at a kind of superficial level

1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:36.560
 of keeping more serotonin in the synapse

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:39.540
 so that more serotonin can be in action

1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:42.520
 as opposed to gobbled back up by those neurons.

1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:43.360
 I should just mention

1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:46.180
 what some of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are.

1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:48.580
 So things like clomipramine,

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:52.700
 which is not entirely selective,

1:22:52.700 --> 1:22:54.820
 I should say that that one generally falls

1:22:54.820 --> 1:22:56.580
 into a category of less selective.

1:22:56.580 --> 1:23:01.260
 So it can impair or can enhance

1:23:01.260 --> 1:23:02.740
 some of the other neurotransmitter

1:23:02.740 --> 1:23:05.820
 or neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera.

1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:09.380
 The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are,

1:23:09.380 --> 1:23:11.900
 at least the classic ones are fluoxetine, Prozac,

1:23:11.900 --> 1:23:16.540
 fluvoxamine, fluvox, peroxetine, sertraline, citalopram,

1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:17.620
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:23:19.060 --> 1:23:21.860
 There are about six classic SSRIs.

1:23:21.860 --> 1:23:25.260
 Some of them like citalopram are used in children

1:23:25.260 --> 1:23:27.840
 and are available in pediatric doses.

1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:30.620
 Some like Prozac may or may not be used in children.

1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:33.700
 The details of which SSRIs, et cetera,

1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:36.140
 is a very extensive literature and discussion.

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:40.260
 And I think it's safe to say that which drugs to use

1:23:40.260 --> 1:23:43.700
 and at which dosage and whether or not to continue,

1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:45.080
 excuse me, the same dosage over time

1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:47.920
 depends a lot on the individual variation

1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:50.460
 that people express and the responses that they have.

1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:51.980
 All of these drugs, in fact,

1:23:51.980 --> 1:23:54.900
 I think we can say all drugs have side effects.

1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:57.780
 The question is how detrimental

1:23:57.780 --> 1:23:59.220
 those side effects are to daily life.

1:23:59.220 --> 1:24:02.380
 The SSRIs are well known to have effects on appetite.

1:24:02.380 --> 1:24:04.860
 In some cases, they abolish appetite.

1:24:04.860 --> 1:24:06.900
 In some cases, they just reduce it a little bit.

1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:09.120
 In some cases, they increase appetite,

1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:10.740
 really is highly individual.

1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:12.340
 They can have effects on libido.

1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:14.680
 For instance, they can reduce sex drive,

1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:17.140
 sometimes in a dose dependent way,

1:24:17.140 --> 1:24:19.340
 sometimes in a way that's more like a step function

1:24:19.340 --> 1:24:22.060
 where people are fine at say five or 10 milligrams,

1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:24.980
 but then they get to 15 milligrams

1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:27.900
 and there's a cliff for their libido.

1:24:28.820 --> 1:24:30.520
 That can happen, it really depends.

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:32.660
 Please don't take those dosages as exact values

1:24:32.660 --> 1:24:35.500
 because this is going to depend on what they're being used

1:24:35.500 --> 1:24:37.580
 for, depression or anxiety or OCD.

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:39.460
 And it's also going to depend on the drug, et cetera.

1:24:39.460 --> 1:24:41.980
 I just threw out those numbers as a way to illustrate

1:24:41.980 --> 1:24:43.860
 what a kind of a step function would look like.

1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:46.180
 It's not gradual, it's immediate at a given dose

1:24:46.180 --> 1:24:47.660
 is what that means.

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:50.860
 The other thing is that some of these drugs

1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:52.860
 will have transient effects.

1:24:52.860 --> 1:24:54.700
 So side effects that show up and then disappear,

1:24:54.700 --> 1:24:57.620
 or sadly people will sometimes take these drugs for a while

1:24:57.620 --> 1:24:59.080
 and then side effects will surface later

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:00.860
 that weren't there previously,

1:25:00.860 --> 1:25:03.040
 depending on life factors, nutrition factors.

1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:05.820
 So it's a very complicated landscape overall.

1:25:05.820 --> 1:25:07.480
 And that's why it's really important to explore

1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:09.980
 any kind of drug treatment, SSRI or otherwise,

1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:12.280
 really in close communication with a psychiatrist

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:14.140
 who really understands the pharmacokinetics

1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:17.100
 and has a lot of patient history and experience with them.

1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:18.340
 So what I'm about to tell you next

1:25:18.340 --> 1:25:20.780
 is most certainly going to come as a big surprise.

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:22.860
 Which is that despite the fact

1:25:22.860 --> 1:25:24.900
 that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

1:25:24.900 --> 1:25:27.660
 can be effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD,

1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:31.260
 at least somewhat, and certainly more than placebo,

1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:33.760
 there is very little, if any evidence

1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:36.820
 that the serotonin system is disrupted in OCD.

1:25:36.820 --> 1:25:39.480
 And I have to point out that this is a somewhat

1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:42.260
 consistent theme in the field of psychiatry.

1:25:42.260 --> 1:25:45.300
 That is a given drug can be very effective

1:25:45.300 --> 1:25:48.480
 or even partially effective in reducing symptoms

1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:50.860
 or in changing the overall landscape

1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:53.620
 of a psychiatric disorder or illness.

1:25:53.620 --> 1:25:56.880
 And yet there is very little, if any, evidence

1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:01.340
 that that particular system is what's causal for OCD

1:26:01.340 --> 1:26:03.780
 or anxiety or depression, et cetera.

1:26:03.780 --> 1:26:05.420
 This is just the landscape that we're living in

1:26:05.420 --> 1:26:07.620
 in terms of our understanding of the brain and psychiatry

1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:09.680
 and the ways of treating brain disorders.

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:12.460
 So as a consequence, there are a huge number

1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:14.780
 of academic reviews that clinicians

1:26:14.780 --> 1:26:16.340
 and research scientists have generated

1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:20.180
 and read and share one of the more,

1:26:20.180 --> 1:26:23.060
 I think, thorough ones in recent years

1:26:23.060 --> 1:26:24.720
 was published in 2021.

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:25.660
 I'll provide a link to this.

1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:29.100
 This is by an excellent, truly excellent researcher

1:26:29.100 --> 1:26:31.240
 from Yale University School of Medicine.

1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:32.460
 I should say not just a researcher,

1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:34.980
 but a clinician scientist, again, an MD, PhD.

1:26:34.980 --> 1:26:37.140
 This is Christopher Pittenger.

1:26:37.140 --> 1:26:38.300
 And the title of the review is

1:26:38.300 --> 1:26:43.300
 pharmacotherapeutic strategies and new targets in OCD.

1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:46.180
 And again, we'll provide a link to it.

1:26:46.180 --> 1:26:49.640
 This is a just gorgeous review describing,

1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:50.480
 as I just told you,

1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:53.340
 that the serotonin system isn't really disrupted in OCD

1:26:53.340 --> 1:26:56.000
 and yet SSRIs can be very effective.

1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:00.080
 The review goes on to explore even what sorts of receptors

1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:01.800
 for serotonin might be involved,

1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:06.620
 if it's in fact the case that serotonin is a culprit

1:27:06.620 --> 1:27:10.160
 in the creation of OCD symptoms.

1:27:11.380 --> 1:27:13.780
 Talk about the serotonin 2A receptor

1:27:13.780 --> 1:27:15.140
 and the serotonin 1A receptor.

1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:16.780
 Why am I mentioning all that detail

1:27:16.780 --> 1:27:19.220
 if in fact it's not clear serotonin is involved?

1:27:19.220 --> 1:27:21.800
 Because I'll just tell you right now,

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:23.140
 there is currently a lot of interest

1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:25.280
 in whether or not some of the psychedelics,

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:26.800
 in particular psilocybin,

1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:29.460
 can be effective in the treatment of OCD.

1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:32.540
 Psilocybin has been shown in various clinical trials,

1:27:32.540 --> 1:27:34.000
 in particular the clinical trials done

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:35.820
 at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine

1:27:35.820 --> 1:27:37.620
 by Matthew Johnson and others.

1:27:37.620 --> 1:27:39.380
 Matthew is on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:27:39.380 --> 1:27:40.980
 He's been on the Tim Ferriss Podcast.

1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:42.980
 He's been on the Lex Friedman Podcast.

1:27:42.980 --> 1:27:44.260
 He's a world-class researcher

1:27:44.260 --> 1:27:46.540
 on the use of psychedelics for depression

1:27:46.540 --> 1:27:49.460
 and other psychiatric challenges.

1:27:49.460 --> 1:27:52.680
 And there, psilocybin treatment has been seen,

1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:54.540
 at least in those trials, to be very effective

1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:58.040
 in the treatment of certain kinds of major depression.

1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:00.180
 Currently, the exploration of psilocybin

1:28:00.180 --> 1:28:03.720
 for the treatment of OCD has not yielded similar results,

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:05.420
 although the studies are ongoing.

1:28:05.420 --> 1:28:07.500
 Again, has not yielded similar effectiveness,

1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:09.060
 but the studies are ongoing.

1:28:09.060 --> 1:28:11.000
 And the serotonin 2A receptor

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.220
 and the serotonin 1A receptors are primary targets

1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:16.420
 for the drug psilocybin.

1:28:16.420 --> 1:28:17.840
 So I figured there were going to be some questions

1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:20.740
 about whether or not psychedelics help with OCD.

1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:23.000
 Thus far, it's inconclusive.

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.420
 If any of you have been part of clinical trials

1:28:25.420 --> 1:28:28.540
 or have knowledge or intuition about this relationship

1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:30.060
 or potential relationship, I should say,

1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:32.700
 between psilocybin or other psychedelics and OCD,

1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:33.880
 please put them in the comment section.

1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:35.940
 We'd love to hear from you.

1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:40.520
 One thing I should point out is that even though serotonin

1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:43.020
 has not been directly implicated in OCD,

1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:45.660
 serotonin and the general systems of serotonin,

1:28:45.660 --> 1:28:47.500
 the circuits in the brain that carry serotonin

1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:49.960
 and depend on it, have been shown

1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:53.860
 to impact cognitive flexibility and inflexibility,

1:28:53.860 --> 1:28:56.060
 which are kind of hallmark themes of OCD.

1:28:56.060 --> 1:28:59.080
 So in animals that have their serotonin depleted

1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:01.940
 or in humans that have very low levels of serotonin,

1:29:01.940 --> 1:29:05.820
 you can see evidence of cognitive inflexibility,

1:29:05.820 --> 1:29:07.460
 challenges in task switching,

1:29:07.460 --> 1:29:09.060
 challenges in switching the rules

1:29:09.060 --> 1:29:10.780
 by which one performs a game,

1:29:10.780 --> 1:29:14.780
 challenges in any kind of cognitive domain switching.

1:29:14.780 --> 1:29:17.940
 And so that does indirectly implicate serotonin

1:29:17.940 --> 1:29:20.060
 in some of the aspects of OCD.

1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:21.760
 Again, when one starts to explore

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:24.200
 the different transmitter systems that have been explored

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:27.780
 in animal models and in humans, it's a vast, vast landscape,

1:29:27.780 --> 1:29:30.860
 but serotonergic drugs do seem to be

1:29:30.860 --> 1:29:34.420
 the most effective drugs in treating OCD, despite the fact,

1:29:34.420 --> 1:29:37.200
 again, despite the fact that there's no direct evidence

1:29:37.200 --> 1:29:42.080
 that serotonin systems are the problem in OCD.

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:45.160
 If you recall the corticostriatal thalamic loop

1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:48.900
 that is so central to the etiology,

1:29:48.900 --> 1:29:52.460
 the presence and the patterns of symptoms in OCD,

1:29:52.460 --> 1:29:54.620
 of course, serotonin is impacting that system.

1:29:54.620 --> 1:29:57.360
 Serotonin is impacting just about every system in the brain,

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:00.580
 but there's no evidence that tinkering with serotonin levels

1:30:00.580 --> 1:30:02.780
 specifically in that network

1:30:02.780 --> 1:30:06.500
 is what's leading to the improvements in OCD.

1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:10.220
 However, if people go into a fMRI scanner

1:30:10.220 --> 1:30:11.540
 and those people have OCD

1:30:11.540 --> 1:30:13.360
 and they evoke the obsessions and compulsions,

1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.400
 you see activity in that corticostriatal thalamic loop.

1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:21.900
 Treatments like SSRIs that reduce the symptoms of OCD

1:30:21.900 --> 1:30:24.580
 equate to a situation where there is less activity

1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:26.100
 in that loop.

1:30:26.100 --> 1:30:29.180
 And I should point out cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:30:29.180 --> 1:30:30.860
 which we have no reason to believe

1:30:30.860 --> 1:30:32.540
 only taps into the serotonin system.

1:30:32.540 --> 1:30:33.980
 I think it would be,

1:30:33.980 --> 1:30:35.760
 the extreme stretch would be false actually

1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:38.020
 to say that cognitive behavioral therapy taps

1:30:38.020 --> 1:30:39.620
 only into the serotonin system.

1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:41.660
 Clearly it's going to affect a huge number of circuits

1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:43.000
 in neurochemical systems.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.620
 Well, people who do cognitive behavioral therapy

1:30:45.620 --> 1:30:47.500
 and find some relief for OCD,

1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:49.040
 they also show reductions

1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:51.780
 in those corticostriatal thalamic loops.

1:30:51.780 --> 1:30:53.220
 So basically we have a situation

1:30:53.220 --> 1:30:55.980
 where we have a behavioral therapy that works

1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:57.860
 in many people, not all,

1:30:57.860 --> 1:31:00.080
 and we have a pretty good understanding of about why it works.

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:01.900
 It increases anxiety tolerance

1:31:01.900 --> 1:31:06.900
 and interference with pattern execution,

1:31:06.980 --> 1:31:10.300
 getting people to not engage in the same sorts of behaviors

1:31:10.300 --> 1:31:12.140
 that are detrimental to them.

1:31:12.140 --> 1:31:14.220
 And we have drug treatments that work,

1:31:14.220 --> 1:31:15.180
 at least to some degree,

1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:16.460
 but we don't know how they work

1:31:16.460 --> 1:31:17.820
 or where they work in the brain.

1:31:17.820 --> 1:31:19.940
 One of the things that really unifies

1:31:19.940 --> 1:31:23.340
 the behavioral treatments and the drug treatments

1:31:23.340 --> 1:31:25.400
 is that they take some period of time.

1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:28.180
 Some relief from symptoms seems to show up around four weeks

1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:29.840
 and certainly by eight weeks

1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:33.180
 for both cognitive behavioral therapy and the SSRIs,

1:31:33.180 --> 1:31:36.360
 but it's really at the 10 to 12 week stage

1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:38.000
 when someone's been doing these twice a week

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:39.940
 cognitive behavioral sessions,

1:31:39.940 --> 1:31:43.600
 where they've been taking a SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks,

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:45.780
 that the really significant reduction

1:31:45.780 --> 1:31:49.140
 in OCD symptoms starts to really show up.

1:31:49.140 --> 1:31:51.120
 Now, up until now, I've been talking about the fact

1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.980
 that people are getting relief from these treatments,

1:31:53.980 --> 1:31:57.260
 but sadly, in the case of OCD,

1:31:57.260 --> 1:32:00.500
 there is a significant population

1:32:00.500 --> 1:32:03.740
 that simply does not respond to CBT

1:32:03.740 --> 1:32:06.580
 or to SSRIs or to their combination,

1:32:06.580 --> 1:32:09.660
 which is why psychiatrists also explore

1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:13.440
 the combination of SSRIs and neuroleptics

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:16.140
 or drugs that tap into the so-called dopamine system

1:32:16.140 --> 1:32:17.400
 or the glutamate system.

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:20.020
 These are other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators

1:32:20.020 --> 1:32:21.780
 that impact different circuits in the brain.

1:32:21.780 --> 1:32:23.020
 And just to really remind you

1:32:23.020 --> 1:32:25.140
 what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators do,

1:32:25.140 --> 1:32:28.080
 because this is important to contextualize all this,

1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:29.720
 neurotransmitters are typically involved

1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:32.820
 in the rapid communication between neurons.

1:32:32.820 --> 1:32:34.780
 And the two most common neurotransmitters for that

1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:37.160
 are the neurotransmitter glutamate,

1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:38.540
 which we say is excitatory,

1:32:38.540 --> 1:32:40.060
 meaning when it's released into the synapse,

1:32:40.060 --> 1:32:43.620
 it causes the next neuron to be more active or active,

1:32:43.620 --> 1:32:46.780
 and GABA, which is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory,

1:32:46.780 --> 1:32:48.620
 meaning when it's released into the synapse,

1:32:48.620 --> 1:32:49.560
 typically, not always,

1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:52.260
 but typically that GABA is going to encourage

1:32:52.260 --> 1:32:54.460
 the next neuron to be less electrically active

1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:56.100
 or even silence its activity.

1:32:57.280 --> 1:32:59.740
 The neuromodulators, by contrast,

1:32:59.740 --> 1:33:01.940
 so not neurotransmitters, but neuromodulators,

1:33:01.940 --> 1:33:05.060
 like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and acetylcholine,

1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:08.460
 and others, operate a little bit differently.

1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:10.580
 They intend to act a little bit more broadly.

1:33:10.580 --> 1:33:12.300
 They can act within the synapse,

1:33:12.300 --> 1:33:15.140
 but they can also change the general patterns

1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:16.340
 of activity in the brain,

1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:18.780
 making certain circuits more likely to be active

1:33:18.780 --> 1:33:21.380
 and other circuits less likely to be active.

1:33:21.380 --> 1:33:24.700
 So when we say dopamine does X or dopamine does Y

1:33:24.700 --> 1:33:26.500
 or serotonin does X or serotonin does Y,

1:33:26.500 --> 1:33:28.100
 they don't really do one thing.

1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:30.540
 They change the sort of overall tonality.

1:33:30.540 --> 1:33:32.060
 They make it more likely or less likely

1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:33.820
 that certain circuits will be active.

1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:36.460
 You can think of them as kind of activating playlists

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:39.500
 or genres of activity in the brain

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:42.340
 rather than being involved in the specific communication

1:33:42.340 --> 1:33:45.100
 or specific songs, if you will, in this analogy,

1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:47.380
 or discussions between particular neurons.

1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:51.500
 So when we hear that SSRIs increase serotonin

1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:53.380
 and reduce the symptoms of OCD,

1:33:53.380 --> 1:33:56.460
 or a neuroleptic reduces the amount of dopamine

1:33:56.460 --> 1:33:59.760
 and makes people feel calmer, for instance,

1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:04.760
 or can remove some stereotyped repetitive motor behavior,

1:34:05.020 --> 1:34:06.820
 which they can either generate

1:34:06.820 --> 1:34:09.380
 or reduce motor behavior, it turns out.

1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:11.820
 So when I say that, what I'm referring to is the fact

1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:14.720
 that these neuromodulators are turning up the volume

1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:15.740
 on certain circuits

1:34:15.740 --> 1:34:18.500
 and turning down the volume on other circuits.

1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:21.180
 I say that because if you are going

1:34:21.180 --> 1:34:25.420
 to explore drug treatments, again, with a licensed physician,

1:34:25.420 --> 1:34:28.340
 if you're going to explore drug treatments for OCD,

1:34:28.340 --> 1:34:31.780
 and in particular, if you are not getting results

1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:34.380
 from SSRIs or you're not getting results

1:34:34.380 --> 1:34:35.620
 from cognitive behavioral therapy

1:34:35.620 --> 1:34:37.540
 or the side effect profiles of the drugs

1:34:37.540 --> 1:34:41.340
 that you're taking for OCD are causing problems

1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:43.080
 that you don't want to take them,

1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:44.960
 well, then it's important to understand

1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:47.080
 that anytime you take one of these drugs,

1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:48.780
 they're not acting specifically

1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:51.460
 on the corticostriatal thalamic circuit.

1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:52.300
 That would be wonderful.

1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:54.260
 That's the future of psychiatry.

1:34:54.260 --> 1:34:58.300
 But as now, when you take a drug, it acts systemically.

1:34:58.300 --> 1:35:00.580
 So it's impacting serotonin in your gut.

1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:02.740
 It's also impacting serotonin in other areas of the brain,

1:35:02.740 --> 1:35:06.900
 hence the effects on things like digestion or libido

1:35:06.900 --> 1:35:08.980
 or any number of different things

1:35:08.980 --> 1:35:10.860
 that serotonin is involved in.

1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:13.980
 Likewise, if you take a neuroleptic like haloperidol

1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:17.540
 or something that reduces dopamine transmission,

1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:19.340
 well, then it's going to have some motor effects

1:35:19.340 --> 1:35:21.380
 because dopamine is involved in the generation

1:35:21.380 --> 1:35:23.660
 of motor sequences and smooth limb movement.

1:35:23.660 --> 1:35:24.740
 That's why people with Parkinson's

1:35:24.740 --> 1:35:27.020
 who don't have much dopamine will get a resting tremor,

1:35:27.020 --> 1:35:28.580
 have a hard time generating smooth movement.

1:35:28.580 --> 1:35:31.020
 And so the side effects start to make sense

1:35:31.020 --> 1:35:33.620
 given the huge number of different neural circuits

1:35:33.620 --> 1:35:35.940
 that these different neuromodulators are involved in.

1:35:35.940 --> 1:35:37.940
 I don't say that to be discouraging.

1:35:37.940 --> 1:35:40.820
 I say that to encourage patients

1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:43.000
 and careful systematic exploration

1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.540
 of different drug treatments for OCD,

1:35:45.540 --> 1:35:50.480
 always, again, with the careful and close guidance

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:52.060
 and oversight of a psychiatrist

1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:53.660
 because psychiatrists really understand

1:35:53.660 --> 1:35:56.140
 which side effect profiles make it likely

1:35:56.140 --> 1:36:00.460
 that you can or cannot or will never

1:36:00.460 --> 1:36:02.540
 or maybe someday we'll be able to take a given drug

1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:03.580
 at a given dose.

1:36:03.580 --> 1:36:05.260
 They are the ones that really have that knowledge.

1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:07.280
 This is not the sort of thing that you want a cowboy

1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:09.540
 and go try and figure out yourself.

1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:11.620
 Now, I also want to acknowledge

1:36:11.620 --> 1:36:13.500
 that there are other forms of drug treatments.

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:15.120
 We touched on psilocybin briefly,

1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:16.860
 but there are other forms of drug treatments

1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:19.220
 that have been explored for OCD.

1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:21.220
 Earlier, we talked a little bit about cannabis.

1:36:21.220 --> 1:36:25.640
 Why would cannabis be a place of exploration at all?

1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:26.580
 Well, first of all,

1:36:26.580 --> 1:36:29.580
 a number of people try and self-medicate for OCD.

1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:31.420
 There is some clinical evidence,

1:36:31.420 --> 1:36:32.700
 I'm not talking about recreational use,

1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:33.740
 I'm talking about clinical evidence

1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:35.600
 that cannabis can reduce anxiety.

1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:38.820
 Now, earlier, we were talking about not reducing anxiety,

1:36:38.820 --> 1:36:41.040
 but learning anxiety tolerance

1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:44.140
 in order to deal with and treat OCD

1:36:44.140 --> 1:36:46.840
 in the context of cognitive behavioral therapies.

1:36:47.820 --> 1:36:49.480
 That doesn't necessarily rule out cannabis

1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:52.920
 as a candidate for the treatment of OCD.

1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:54.620
 And in fact, this has been explored.

1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:59.200
 A study from Dr. Blair Simpson herself looked at this.

1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:00.940
 This was a fairly small scale study.

1:37:00.940 --> 1:37:02.260
 So first of all, I'll give you the title,

1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:03.360
 and again, we'll provide a link.

1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:05.500
 This is entitled Acute Effects of Cannabinoids

1:37:05.500 --> 1:37:07.620
 on Symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.420
 Human Laboratory Study.

1:37:09.420 --> 1:37:10.980
 Very briefly, this was 14 adults

1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:14.380
 with OCD, they had prior experience with cannabis.

1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:16.540
 This was randomized, placebo-controlled.

1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:19.080
 The cannabis was smoked.

1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.500
 They had different varietals, as they're called.

1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:22.400
 They had a placebo.

1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:24.980
 So this is basically a condition

1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:28.440
 in which certain subjects consumed a cigarette

1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:31.980
 that had 0% THC, others had 7% THC,

1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:33.180
 other groups, that is,

1:37:33.180 --> 1:37:37.940
 or some had 0.4% CBD and THC,

1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:39.020
 so they looked at CBD.

1:37:39.020 --> 1:37:41.320
 I know a lot of people out there are interested in CBD.

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:42.620
 There's one of the few studies I could find

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:46.580
 where they explored different percentages of THC and CBD

1:37:46.580 --> 1:37:50.960
 in these cannabis or marijuana cigarettes, basically.

1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.900
 The total amount that they consumed,

1:37:52.900 --> 1:37:54.620
 I believe, was 800 milligrams.

1:37:54.620 --> 1:37:56.680
 These, again, are not suggestions.

1:37:56.680 --> 1:37:58.660
 This was just simply reporting what's in this study.

1:37:58.660 --> 1:38:00.460
 You can, again, I'll provide a link.

1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:04.720
 They looked at OCD symptoms ratings.

1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:06.820
 They looked at cardiovascular effects.

1:38:06.820 --> 1:38:08.500
 They had a large number of different things

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:09.460
 that they explored.

1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:11.740
 And I should say, this study was done in 2020,

1:38:11.740 --> 1:38:15.060
 and it was the first placebo-controlled investigation

1:38:15.060 --> 1:38:18.060
 of cannabis in adults with obsessive compulsive disorder.

1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:19.180
 Pretty interesting.

1:38:19.180 --> 1:38:21.580
 And I'm just reading from their conclusions here.

1:38:21.580 --> 1:38:23.280
 The data suggests that smoked cannabis,

1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:26.480
 whether containing primarily THC or CBD,

1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:28.500
 remember, they looked at different concentrations of those,

1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:30.300
 has little acute impact,

1:38:30.300 --> 1:38:32.740
 meaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms,

1:38:33.820 --> 1:38:35.820
 and yields smaller reductions in anxiety

1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:37.140
 compared to placebo.

1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:40.380
 So they did not see a, when I say a positive effect,

1:38:40.380 --> 1:38:43.200
 I mean a ameliorative effect,

1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:47.620
 an effect in reducing symptoms of OCD from cannabis or CBD,

1:38:47.620 --> 1:38:49.660
 which, you know, it's unfortunate.

1:38:49.660 --> 1:38:51.580
 I think it's unfortunate anytime a treatment doesn't work,

1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:52.860
 but nonetheless, those are the data.

1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:54.500
 I'm sure there are going to be other studies.

1:38:54.500 --> 1:38:55.680
 I'm sure there are also going to be people

1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.260
 in the YouTube comments section saying that cannabis

1:38:58.260 --> 1:39:01.580
 and CBD helps their OCD symptoms.

1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:04.040
 At least I anticipate there probably will.

1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:05.100
 Almost everything I say here,

1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:06.700
 somebody will contradict it with something

1:39:06.700 --> 1:39:08.900
 from their experience, which I encourage, by the way.

1:39:08.900 --> 1:39:11.260
 I want to hear about your experience with certain things,

1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:14.380
 even if it's not from randomized placebo-controlled studies.

1:39:14.380 --> 1:39:16.140
 I still find it very interesting to know

1:39:16.140 --> 1:39:18.240
 what people are doing and what they're experiencing.

1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:19.740
 I think that's one of the better uses

1:39:19.740 --> 1:39:21.140
 of social media comment sections

1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:22.620
 is to be able to share some of that,

1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:25.220
 not in an advice-giving way or prescriptive way,

1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:27.400
 but simply as a way to share and encourage

1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:29.040
 different types of exploration.

1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:30.320
 There are other sorts of drug treatments

1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:32.940
 that are gaining popularity for OCD,

1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:34.720
 at least in the research realm.

1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:38.180
 One treatment that is a legal, L-E-G-A-L, right?

1:39:38.180 --> 1:39:39.160
 Sometimes when I say legal,

1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:40.460
 sometimes people think I say illegal,

1:39:40.460 --> 1:39:43.440
 but that is legal, at least by prescription

1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:45.860
 in the United States, is ketamine.

1:39:45.860 --> 1:39:49.340
 The actions of ketamine are somewhat complex.

1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:50.500
 Although we know, for instance,

1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:52.700
 that ketamine acts on the glutamate system,

1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:56.380
 it tends to disrupt the transmission

1:39:56.380 --> 1:40:00.260
 or the relationship, I should say, between glutamate,

1:40:00.260 --> 1:40:02.080
 right, not glutamine, not the amino acid,

1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:04.260
 but glutamate, the neurotransmitter,

1:40:04.260 --> 1:40:07.860
 and the so-called NMDA, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,

1:40:07.860 --> 1:40:10.560
 which is a receptor that's very special

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:11.400
 in the nervous system,

1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:14.340
 because when glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor,

1:40:14.340 --> 1:40:17.300
 it tends to offer the opportunity

1:40:17.300 --> 1:40:19.140
 for that particular synapse to get stronger,

1:40:19.140 --> 1:40:20.580
 so-called neuroplasticity,

1:40:20.580 --> 1:40:24.360
 and ketamine is essentially an antagonist,

1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.380
 although it works through a complicated mechanism,

1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:30.420
 it tends to block that binding of glutamate

1:40:30.420 --> 1:40:32.620
 to the NMDA receptor or the effectiveness of that.

1:40:32.620 --> 1:40:35.640
 Ketamine therapy is now being used quite extensively

1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:37.500
 for the treatment of trauma and for depression.

1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:39.500
 It leads to a dissociative state.

1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:42.500
 It's a so-called dissociative analgesic,

1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:44.640
 and there are a variety of ways in which that happens.

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:45.920
 We did an episode on depression.

1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:48.840
 We're going to do another entire episode all about ketamine,

1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:51.180
 describing the networks that ketamine impacts, et cetera.

1:40:51.180 --> 1:40:54.020
 Ketamine therapies are being explored for OCD.

1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:57.620
 As of now, the data look somewhat promising,

1:40:57.620 --> 1:41:00.500
 but there's still a lot more work that needs to be done.

1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:03.700
 My read of the data are that the more extensive

1:41:03.700 --> 1:41:06.380
 clinical trials have not happened yet.

1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:09.260
 The smaller studies that have happened

1:41:09.260 --> 1:41:11.340
 reveal that some patients do get some relief

1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:13.460
 from ketamine therapy for OCD,

1:41:13.460 --> 1:41:17.380
 but there was nothing overwhelmingly pointing to the fact

1:41:17.380 --> 1:41:21.520
 that ketamine is a magic bullet for OCD treatment.

1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:24.380
 So cannabis CBD, at least now,

1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:26.540
 even though it's one smaller study,

1:41:26.540 --> 1:41:30.820
 there's no real evidence that it can alleviate OCD symptoms.

1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:33.240
 If there are new studies published soon,

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:34.620
 I'll be sure to update you.

1:41:34.620 --> 1:41:36.520
 And if you see those studies, please send them to me.

1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.880
 Ketamine therapy, the jury is still out.

1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:40.820
 Psilocybin, the jury is still out.

1:41:40.820 --> 1:41:42.400
 These are early days.

1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:45.380
 Another treatment that's becoming somewhat common,

1:41:45.380 --> 1:41:47.680
 or at least people are commonly excited about,

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:49.980
 is transcranial magnetic stimulation.

1:41:49.980 --> 1:41:52.260
 So this is the use of a magnetic coil.

1:41:52.260 --> 1:41:53.880
 This is completely noninvasive,

1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:56.980
 placed on one portion of the skull,

1:41:56.980 --> 1:42:01.460
 and one can direct magnetic energy

1:42:01.460 --> 1:42:03.120
 toward particular areas of the brain

1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:04.920
 to either suppress or nowadays,

1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:07.400
 you can also activate particular brain regions.

1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:08.460
 There are some interesting data

1:42:08.460 --> 1:42:10.460
 showing that if TMS is applied

1:42:10.460 --> 1:42:11.900
 to areas of the brain involved

1:42:11.900 --> 1:42:13.980
 in the generation of motor action,

1:42:13.980 --> 1:42:15.740
 so the so-called motor areas

1:42:15.740 --> 1:42:18.580
 or supplementary motor areas, as they're called,

1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:23.140
 while people think about or have intrusive thoughts,

1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:27.100
 we know that the TMS coil can interrupt the motor behaviors,

1:42:27.100 --> 1:42:29.100
 the compulsive behaviors,

1:42:29.100 --> 1:42:32.220
 and at least in a small cohort of studies,

1:42:32.220 --> 1:42:35.080
 in a small number of patients within those studies,

1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:37.340
 this has been shown to be effective,

1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:39.420
 not just while the coil is on the head, of course,

1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:41.940
 but after the study has been performed

1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:45.620
 or the treatment's been performed in reducing OCD symptoms

1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:50.180
 by disrupting the tendency for the compulsive behavior

1:42:50.180 --> 1:42:51.540
 to be so automatic.

1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:54.780
 One of the key features of obsessive compulsive disorder

1:42:54.780 --> 1:42:58.620
 is that, especially if it's been around for a while,

1:42:58.620 --> 1:43:00.300
 the person's been dealing with it for a while,

1:43:00.300 --> 1:43:03.380
 there isn't a pattern in which the person thinks,

1:43:03.380 --> 1:43:07.380
 oh, I have this contamination fear, or I need symmetry,

1:43:07.380 --> 1:43:09.700
 or I'm kind of obsessed to count to the number seven,

1:43:09.700 --> 1:43:12.860
 and then they pause and they go, ooh, and then they do it.

1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:16.220
 No, typically there's a very close pairing

1:43:16.220 --> 1:43:18.540
 of the obsession and the compulsion in time

1:43:18.540 --> 1:43:19.940
 so that somebody is walking down the street

1:43:19.940 --> 1:43:22.340
 thinking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7,

1:43:22.340 --> 1:43:23.860
 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.140
 and then they're doing this in such rapid succession

1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:29.420
 because the obsessions are coming up so quickly, right?

1:43:29.420 --> 1:43:31.660
 Thoughts can be generated very quickly,

1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:33.220
 and then they're generating the compulsions

1:43:33.220 --> 1:43:36.680
 as a way to beat down or to try and suppress that anxiety,

1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:39.060
 and then it comes right back up again at even stronger,

1:43:39.060 --> 1:43:40.400
 as I described earlier.

1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:43.260
 So transcranial magnetic stimulation seems to intervene

1:43:43.260 --> 1:43:45.080
 in these various fast processes.

1:43:46.100 --> 1:43:48.300
 Right now, I don't think it's fair to say

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:50.740
 that TMS is a magic bullet either.

1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:52.460
 I think there's a lot of excitement about TMS,

1:43:52.460 --> 1:43:55.840
 and in particular, I really want to nail this point home.

1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:59.500
 In particular, there's excitement about the combination

1:43:59.500 --> 1:44:01.780
 of TMS with drug treatments,

1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:05.860
 or the combination of TMS with cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:44:05.860 --> 1:44:07.420
 and this is a really important point,

1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:08.660
 not just for sake of discussion

1:44:08.660 --> 1:44:10.200
 about obsessive-compulsive disorder,

1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:14.740
 but also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia,

1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:17.740
 any number of different psychiatric challenges

1:44:17.740 --> 1:44:21.460
 and disorders in most cases are going to respond best

1:44:21.460 --> 1:44:24.180
 to a combination of behavioral treatment that's ongoing

1:44:24.180 --> 1:44:26.040
 that occurs in the laboratory and clinical setting,

1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:28.700
 but also in the home setting where there's homework,

1:44:28.700 --> 1:44:29.900
 maybe even home visits.

1:44:31.140 --> 1:44:33.660
 Drug treatments often, not always,

1:44:33.660 --> 1:44:36.260
 are a terrific augment to those cognitive behavioral

1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:38.020
 therapies or other behavioral therapies,

1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:40.020
 and then now we are living in the age

1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:41.260
 of brain-machine interface.

1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:43.020
 You have companies like Neural Length

1:44:43.020 --> 1:44:45.580
 that I think it's fair to say are going to enter

1:44:45.580 --> 1:44:48.180
 the brain-machine interface world first

1:44:48.180 --> 1:44:51.900
 through the treatment of certain syndromes, right?

1:44:51.900 --> 1:44:53.900
 Movement syndromes or psychiatric syndromes,

1:44:53.900 --> 1:44:56.120
 probably before they start putting electrodes

1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:58.620
 into the brain to stimulate enhanced memory

1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:00.020
 or enhanced cognition, who knows?

1:45:00.020 --> 1:45:01.820
 I don't know exactly what they're doing

1:45:01.820 --> 1:45:04.180
 behind the walls of Neural Link, but I have to imagine,

1:45:04.180 --> 1:45:06.760
 in fact, I would wager, maybe not both arms,

1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:08.300
 but I'll wager my left arm,

1:45:08.300 --> 1:45:13.300
 that the first set of FDA-approved technologies

1:45:13.300 --> 1:45:15.940
 to come out of companies like Neural Link

1:45:15.940 --> 1:45:17.100
 are going to be those for the treatment

1:45:17.100 --> 1:45:19.180
 of things like Parkinson's and movement disorders

1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:22.140
 and cognitive disorders, rather than, shall we say,

1:45:22.140 --> 1:45:24.860
 kind of recreational cognitive enhancement

1:45:24.860 --> 1:45:26.060
 or things of that sort.

1:45:26.060 --> 1:45:28.500
 So transcranial magnetic stimulation is noninvasive.

1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:30.860
 It doesn't involve going down below the skull,

1:45:30.860 --> 1:45:33.660
 can have some effect, but most laboratories

1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:36.180
 that I'm aware of at Stanford and elsewhere

1:45:36.180 --> 1:45:38.360
 that are exploring TMS for things like OCD

1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:41.420
 and other types of psychiatric challenges

1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:44.540
 are using TMS in combination with drug therapies,

1:45:44.540 --> 1:45:46.940
 are using, in some cases, for instance,

1:45:46.940 --> 1:45:50.180
 a laboratory at Stanford, hope to get them on the podcast,

1:45:50.180 --> 1:45:52.940
 psychiatrist Nolan Williams is exploring TMS

1:45:52.940 --> 1:45:55.060
 in combination with psychedelic therapies,

1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:56.340
 not necessarily at the same time,

1:45:56.340 --> 1:45:58.020
 but nonetheless combining them

1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:00.460
 or exploring how they impact brain circuitry.

1:46:00.460 --> 1:46:03.220
 So if you have OCD, should you run out and get TMS

1:46:03.220 --> 1:46:05.180
 or should you try ketamine therapy, of course,

1:46:05.180 --> 1:46:06.380
 with a licensed physician?

1:46:06.380 --> 1:46:08.460
 I think it's too early to say yes.

1:46:08.460 --> 1:46:11.380
 I think the answer is we need to wait and see.

1:46:11.380 --> 1:46:13.700
 I think cognitive behavioral therapy, the SSRIs

1:46:13.700 --> 1:46:16.460
 and some other drug treatments like neuroleptics

1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:19.360
 combined with SSRIs and cognitive behavioral therapy

1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:22.500
 are where the real bulk of the data are.

1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:25.120
 I want to make one additional point about cannabis CBD

1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:27.820
 as it relates to obsessive compulsive disorder.

1:46:27.820 --> 1:46:32.100
 To me, it's not at all surprising that cannabis CBD

1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:34.340
 did not improve symptoms of OCD

1:46:34.340 --> 1:46:38.260
 because in my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte a few weeks ago

1:46:38.260 --> 1:46:40.780
 and as you mentioned, Dr. Conte is indeed a medical doctor,

1:46:40.780 --> 1:46:44.240
 a psychiatrist, we were talking about cannabis

1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:45.220
 and its various uses

1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:48.220
 because it does have some clinical applications.

1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:51.540
 And he mentioned that one of the main effects of cannabis

1:46:51.540 --> 1:46:56.540
 is to tighten focus and to enhance concentration on

1:46:57.620 --> 1:47:00.420
 and thoughts about one particular thing.

1:47:00.420 --> 1:47:03.060
 And in some cases that can be clinically beneficial

1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:06.100
 and in other cases that can be clinically detrimental.

1:47:06.100 --> 1:47:11.100
 If you accept the idea that cannabis increases focus

1:47:11.860 --> 1:47:15.860
 and you think about OCD and the networks involved

1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:18.140
 and you think about the anxiety and the relationship

1:47:18.140 --> 1:47:20.860
 between the obsession and compulsion,

1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:22.620
 well then it shouldn't come as any surprise

1:47:22.620 --> 1:47:26.100
 that cannabis did not improve the symptoms of OCD

1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:28.980
 because if anything, it would increase focus

1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:30.820
 on the obsessions and the compulsions.

1:47:30.820 --> 1:47:31.940
 Now that's not what they observed.

1:47:31.940 --> 1:47:35.380
 They did not see an exacerbation or a worsening

1:47:35.380 --> 1:47:37.340
 of the symptoms of OCD with cannabis.

1:47:37.340 --> 1:47:39.100
 At least that's not my read of the data

1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:41.060
 but they did not see an improvement

1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:44.100
 in OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD.

1:47:44.100 --> 1:47:46.060
 And to me, that's not surprising

1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.540
 given that cannabis CBD seems to increase focus.

1:47:49.540 --> 1:47:52.020
 Next, I'd like to talk about some of the research on

1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:55.060
 and the roles of hormones in OCD

1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:55.900
 because it turns out to be

1:47:55.900 --> 1:47:57.840
 a very interesting relationship there.

1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:00.260
 But before I do, I want to point out something that

1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:02.460
 I realize I probably should have said earlier

1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:05.560
 which is one of the key things for someone with OCD

1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:08.140
 to come to understand if they're going to experience

1:48:08.140 --> 1:48:09.780
 any relief of their symptoms,

1:48:09.780 --> 1:48:10.940
 whether or not they're doing drug treatments

1:48:10.940 --> 1:48:12.980
 or behavioral treatments or otherwise,

1:48:12.980 --> 1:48:17.980
 is that thoughts are not as bad as actions, right?

1:48:18.660 --> 1:48:20.720
 Thoughts are not as bad as actions.

1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:24.060
 One of the kind of rules that people with OCD

1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:26.900
 seem to adopt for themselves is that

1:48:26.900 --> 1:48:30.300
 thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions.

1:48:30.300 --> 1:48:31.860
 So they'll have an intrusive thought

1:48:31.860 --> 1:48:33.980
 and we haven't spent too much time on this today,

1:48:33.980 --> 1:48:36.280
 but earlier I touched on the fact that

1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:39.240
 some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in OCD

1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:40.420
 are really disturbing.

1:48:40.420 --> 1:48:44.060
 They can be really gross or at least gross to that person.

1:48:44.060 --> 1:48:49.000
 They can evoke imagery that is toxic or infectious

1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:52.840
 or is highly sexualized in a way that is disturbing to them,

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:54.440
 can be very taboo.

1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:57.140
 This is not uncommon when you start talking to people

1:48:57.140 --> 1:48:59.460
 with OCD and you start pulling on the thread.

1:48:59.460 --> 1:49:01.420
 Again, this would be a psychiatrist

1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:03.580
 who is trained to ask the right questions

1:49:03.580 --> 1:49:05.900
 and gain the comfort and trust of a patient.

1:49:05.900 --> 1:49:07.680
 They start to reveal that these thoughts

1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:09.620
 are really intrusive and kind of disturbing,

1:49:09.620 --> 1:49:11.180
 which is why they feel so compelled

1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:13.340
 to try and suppress them with behaviors.

1:49:13.340 --> 1:49:17.260
 One of the powerful elements of treatment for OCD

1:49:17.260 --> 1:49:20.440
 is to really support the patient

1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.240
 and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts

1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:26.500
 and that everyone has disturbing thoughts.

1:49:26.500 --> 1:49:28.340
 And that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts

1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:30.740
 arise at the most inconvenient

1:49:30.740 --> 1:49:32.060
 and sometimes what seems like

1:49:32.060 --> 1:49:34.980
 the most inappropriate circumstances.

1:49:34.980 --> 1:49:37.300
 And this relates to a whole larger discussion

1:49:37.300 --> 1:49:39.740
 that we could have about what are thoughts

1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:40.580
 and why do they surface

1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:43.500
 and how come when you stand at the edge of a bridge,

1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:45.140
 even if you do not want to jump off,

1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:46.780
 you think about jumping off.

1:49:46.780 --> 1:49:49.420
 And this has to do with the fact that your nervous system

1:49:49.420 --> 1:49:52.640
 as a prediction machine is oftentimes testing possibilities.

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:55.220
 And sometimes that testing goes way off

1:49:55.220 --> 1:50:00.220
 into the Netherlands of the thought patterns

1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:03.340
 and emotional patterns that we all have inside of us.

1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:05.820
 The big difference between a thought and an action

1:50:05.820 --> 1:50:09.660
 is that, of course, the nervous system is in one case

1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:12.220
 not translating those patterns of thinking

1:50:12.220 --> 1:50:14.000
 into motor sequences.

1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:18.620
 That nerdy way of saying thoughts aren't actions,

1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:20.300
 believe it or not, can be helpful for people

1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:22.220
 if they really think about that

1:50:22.220 --> 1:50:24.900
 and use it as an opportunity to realize that,

1:50:24.900 --> 1:50:27.340
 first of all, they're not crazy.

1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:30.280
 They're not thinking and feeling this stuff

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:32.140
 because they're bad or evil.

1:50:32.140 --> 1:50:34.140
 And of course, sometimes this can cross over

1:50:34.140 --> 1:50:37.380
 with other elements of life where we place moral judgment

1:50:37.380 --> 1:50:38.580
 on people for certain behaviors.

1:50:38.580 --> 1:50:40.640
 I think that's part of a healthy society, of course.

1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:42.140
 That's where we have laws and punishments

1:50:42.140 --> 1:50:45.660
 and rewards for that matter for certain types of behaviors.

1:50:45.660 --> 1:50:48.220
 But this idea that thoughts are not as bad as actions

1:50:48.220 --> 1:50:49.740
 and that thoughts can be tolerated

1:50:49.740 --> 1:50:52.480
 and the anxiety around thoughts can be tolerated

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:54.020
 and over time can diminish,

1:50:54.020 --> 1:50:56.280
 that's a very powerful hallmark theme

1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:57.420
 of the treatment of OCD.

1:50:57.420 --> 1:50:59.900
 So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.

1:50:59.900 --> 1:51:01.860
 Thoughts are not actions.

1:51:01.860 --> 1:51:03.020
 Actions can harm us.

1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:04.500
 They can harm other people.

1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:08.460
 They can soak up enormous amounts of time.

1:51:08.460 --> 1:51:10.860
 Thoughts can soak up enormous amounts of time.

1:51:10.860 --> 1:51:11.920
 They can be very troubling.

1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:13.140
 They can be very detrimental.

1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:15.780
 We, of course, want to be sensitive to that.

1:51:15.780 --> 1:51:18.780
 But when it really comes down to it,

1:51:18.780 --> 1:51:22.800
 the first step in treatment for OCD is this realization

1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:24.480
 or the approach to the realization

1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:27.260
 that thoughts are not as bad as actions.

1:51:27.260 --> 1:51:29.500
 So what about hormones in OCD?

1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:30.700
 Well, this has been explored,

1:51:30.700 --> 1:51:33.620
 albeit not as extensively as I would have liked to find.

1:51:33.620 --> 1:51:35.340
 But when I went into the literature,

1:51:35.340 --> 1:51:38.220
 I found one particularly interesting study

1:51:38.220 --> 1:51:40.180
 entitled Neurosteroid Levels in Patients

1:51:40.180 --> 1:51:43.100
 with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder for Sathur Erbe.

1:51:43.100 --> 1:51:45.460
 And as always, we'll provide a link to the study.

1:51:47.020 --> 1:51:49.520
 The objective of this study was to explore serum

1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:53.700
 within blood, neurosteroid levels in people with OCD.

1:51:53.700 --> 1:51:54.540
 Why?

1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:57.320
 Well, because of the relationship between OCD and anxiety

1:51:57.320 --> 1:51:59.640
 and the fact that in stress-related disorders,

1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:01.240
 such as anxiety and depression,

1:52:02.220 --> 1:52:04.100
 the hormones have been extensively explored,

1:52:04.100 --> 1:52:06.760
 but not so much in OCD, at least until this study.

1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:08.260
 So they compared serum levels

1:52:08.260 --> 1:52:10.340
 of a number of different hormones, progesterone,

1:52:10.340 --> 1:52:15.340
 pregnenolone, DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.

1:52:15.340 --> 1:52:17.260
 This was done in 30 patients with OCD

1:52:17.260 --> 1:52:19.560
 and 30 healthy controls.

1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:20.980
 So it's not a huge study,

1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:23.980
 but it's enough to draw some pretty nice conclusions.

1:52:23.980 --> 1:52:26.860
 These subjects were 18 to 49 years old,

1:52:26.860 --> 1:52:30.300
 and the controls were age and sex matched,

1:52:30.300 --> 1:52:32.820
 healthy volunteers, again, no OCD.

1:52:32.820 --> 1:52:34.220
 What was the basic takeaway from the study?

1:52:34.220 --> 1:52:35.860
 The basic takeaway from the study was that

1:52:35.860 --> 1:52:39.580
 in females with OCD, there was evidence

1:52:39.580 --> 1:52:43.620
 for significantly elevated cortisol and DHEA.

1:52:43.620 --> 1:52:46.860
 Now that's interesting because cortisol is well-known

1:52:46.860 --> 1:52:48.540
 to be associated with the stress system,

1:52:48.540 --> 1:52:50.660
 although every day, I should mention,

1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:52.980
 we all, male or female,

1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:55.740
 everybody experiences an increase in cortisol

1:52:55.740 --> 1:52:56.740
 shortly after awakening.

1:52:56.740 --> 1:52:59.000
 That's a healthy increase in cortisol.

1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:03.120
 Late shifted, I mean, late in the day peaks in cortisol,

1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:06.540
 where a shift in that cortisol peak to later in the day

1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:11.540
 is a known correlate of depression and anxiety disorders.

1:53:12.620 --> 1:53:15.780
 So the fact that cortisol is elevated in DHEA,

1:53:15.780 --> 1:53:19.260
 are elevated in female patients with OCD,

1:53:19.260 --> 1:53:23.660
 suggests that cortisol is either reflective of

1:53:23.660 --> 1:53:26.780
 or causal for the increase in anxiety.

1:53:26.780 --> 1:53:28.880
 We don't know the direction of that effect.

1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:31.640
 Now, in the male patients with OCD,

1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:33.780
 there was evidence for increased cortisol,

1:53:33.780 --> 1:53:36.980
 again, not surprising given the role of anxiety in cortisol,

1:53:36.980 --> 1:53:39.900
 or I should say, given the role of cortisol in anxiety

1:53:39.900 --> 1:53:42.840
 and the increasing anxiety seen in OCD,

1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:45.940
 but there were also significant reductions in testosterone,

1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:48.140
 which should also not surprise us

1:53:48.140 --> 1:53:51.980
 because cortisol and testosterone more or less compete

1:53:51.980 --> 1:53:54.940
 in some fashion for their own production.

1:53:54.940 --> 1:53:57.860
 Both are derived from the molecule cholesterol,

1:53:57.860 --> 1:53:59.620
 and there are certain biochemical pathways

1:53:59.620 --> 1:54:01.820
 that can either direct that cholesterol molecule

1:54:01.820 --> 1:54:05.180
 toward cortisol synthesis or testosterone synthesis,

1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:06.500
 but not both.

1:54:06.500 --> 1:54:07.320
 So they compete.

1:54:07.320 --> 1:54:09.460
 So when cortisol goes up in general, not always,

1:54:09.460 --> 1:54:12.540
 but in general, testosterone goes down and vice versa.

1:54:12.540 --> 1:54:14.280
 If you want to learn more about the relationship

1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:15.780
 between cortisol and testosterone,

1:54:15.780 --> 1:54:18.700
 and there are even some tools to try and optimize those

1:54:18.700 --> 1:54:20.380
 ratios in both males and females,

1:54:20.380 --> 1:54:23.100
 you can find that in our episode on optimizing testosterone

1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:25.740
 and estrogen, that's at Hubermanlab.com.

1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:28.940
 Now, I would say the most interesting aspect of this study

1:54:28.940 --> 1:54:32.680
 is not that DHEA and cortisol are elevated in females

1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:35.640
 with OCD or that cortisol and testosterone

1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:36.580
 have this opposite effect,

1:54:36.580 --> 1:54:40.080
 cortisol up and testosterone down in males with OCD,

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:43.020
 but rather the relationship between all of those,

1:54:43.020 --> 1:54:48.020
 DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone in terms of GABA.

1:54:48.700 --> 1:54:51.540
 GABA, again, being this inhibitory neurotransmitter

1:54:51.540 --> 1:54:56.020
 that tends to quiet certain neuronal pathways.

1:54:56.020 --> 1:54:58.780
 It does different things at different synapses,

1:54:58.780 --> 1:55:01.140
 but in general, the more GABA that's present,

1:55:01.140 --> 1:55:02.740
 the more inhibition that's present,

1:55:02.740 --> 1:55:05.500
 and therefore the more suppression of neural activity.

1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:10.500
 And DHEA is known to be a potent antagonist

1:55:10.500 --> 1:55:13.400
 of the GABA system, okay?

1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:18.400
 So here we have elevated DHEA in females,

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:21.060
 and I should also mention that testosterone

1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:23.800
 is also known to tap into the GABA system.

1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:26.120
 Typically when testosterone is elevated,

1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:29.720
 GABA transmission at least is slightly elevated.

1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:33.060
 So here we have a situation in which the pattern of hormones

1:55:33.060 --> 1:55:37.480
 in females and males with OCD are different

1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:40.760
 from those in people without OCD,

1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:43.820
 such that GABA transmission is altered,

1:55:43.820 --> 1:55:47.600
 and the net effect would be an overall reduction in GABA.

1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:51.320
 Now, GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter,

1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:52.600
 and broadly speaking,

1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:55.720
 is associated with lower levels of anxiety,

1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:57.720
 and it tends to create balance

1:55:57.720 --> 1:55:59.400
 within various neural circuits.

1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:00.600
 Now that's a very broad statement,

1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:03.520
 but we know for instance in epilepsy

1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:04.960
 that GABA levels are reduced,

1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:06.960
 and therefore you get runaway excitation

1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:08.320
 of certain circuits in the brain,

1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:09.640
 and therefore seizures,

1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:11.440
 either petit mal, mini seizures,

1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:13.300
 or grand mal, massive seizures,

1:56:13.300 --> 1:56:14.400
 or even drop seizures,

1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:16.800
 where people completely collapse to the floor in seizure.

1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:18.360
 You may have seen this before.

1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:19.200
 I certainly have.

1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:20.020
 It's very dramatic,

1:56:20.020 --> 1:56:22.960
 and it actually is quite debilitating for people

1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:24.000
 because obviously they don't know

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.200
 when these seizures are coming on most often,

1:56:26.200 --> 1:56:28.160
 and then they can fall into a stove

1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:29.880
 or while driving, et cetera.

1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:33.160
 So the situation with OCD is one in which,

1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:34.240
 for whatever reason,

1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:37.520
 we don't know the direction of effect.

1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:39.480
 Certain hormones are elevated in females,

1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:41.240
 and certain hormones are elevated in males,

1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:45.560
 and those hormones differ between males and females,

1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:48.060
 and yet they both funnel into a system

1:56:48.060 --> 1:56:51.160
 where GABAergic or GABA transmission in the brain

1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:53.400
 is reduced because of this ability

1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:57.200
 for those particular hormones to be antagonists to GABA,

1:56:57.200 --> 1:56:59.060
 and as a consequence,

1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:03.480
 there's likely to be overall levels of increased excitation

1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:05.340
 in certain networks in the brain,

1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:07.200
 and that brings us back

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:09.780
 to this corticostriatal thalamic loop,

1:57:09.780 --> 1:57:12.360
 this repetitive loop that seems to reinforce,

1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:15.480
 we can say reinforces obsession,

1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:17.820
 leads to anxiety, leads to compulsion,

1:57:17.820 --> 1:57:20.340
 leads to transient relief of anxiety,

1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:23.520
 but then increase in anxiety, increased obsession,

1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:25.440
 anxiety, compulsion, anxiety, compulsion,

1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:27.740
 anxiety, compulsion, and so on and so forth.

1:57:27.740 --> 1:57:30.660
 So I have not found studies

1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:34.320
 that have explored adjusting testosterone levels

1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:36.040
 through exogenous administration,

1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:37.620
 cream or injection or otherwise,

1:57:37.620 --> 1:57:42.200
 or that have focused on reducing DHEA in females.

1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:43.760
 If anyone is aware of such studies,

1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:46.840
 please put them in the comment section on YouTube

1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:47.800
 or send them to us.

1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:50.640
 We have a contact site on the website at HubermanLab.com,

1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:53.240
 but the comment section on YouTube would be best,

1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:56.200
 but because we know that hormones impact neuromodulators

1:57:56.200 --> 1:57:58.040
 and neurotransmitters, as I just described,

1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:00.080
 and that those neuromodulators and neurotransmitters

1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:02.200
 play an intimate role in the generation

1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:05.280
 and the treatment of things like OCD,

1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:08.320
 it stands to reason that manipulations

1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:11.600
 of those hormone systems, however subtle or dramatic,

1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:14.320
 might, I want to highlight, might prove useful

1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:16.200
 in adjusting the symptoms of OCD,

1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:17.480
 and I hope that this is an area

1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:20.920
 that researchers are going to pursue in the very near future

1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:24.560
 because many of the treatments for reducing DHEA

1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:27.040
 or increasing testosterone or reducing cortisol

1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:29.880
 have already made it through FDA approval.

1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:31.320
 They're out there.

1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:32.380
 They're readily prescribed.

1:58:32.380 --> 1:58:33.980
 Many of them are already in generic form,

1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:36.400
 which means that the patents have already lapsed

1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:39.160
 on the first versions of those drugs,

1:58:39.160 --> 1:58:41.480
 so when they're available as generic drugs,

1:58:41.480 --> 1:58:44.680
 very often they're available at significantly lower cost.

1:58:44.680 --> 1:58:46.040
 There's a whole discussion to be had there

1:58:46.040 --> 1:58:49.440
 about patent laws and prescription drugs,

1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:52.080
 but because these drugs are largely available

1:58:52.080 --> 1:58:55.680
 in prescription yet generic form,

1:58:55.680 --> 1:58:57.000
 I think there's a great opportunity

1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:00.580
 to explore how hormones, not just cortisol,

1:59:00.580 --> 1:59:04.080
 testosterone, and DHEA, but the huge category of hormones

1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:06.480
 might impact the symptoms of OCD,

1:59:06.480 --> 1:59:09.200
 especially since many of the symptoms of OCD

1:59:09.200 --> 1:59:11.220
 show up right around the time of puberty.

1:59:11.220 --> 1:59:13.080
 We haven't talked a lot about childhood OCD

1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:14.680
 because we're going to do an entire series

1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:17.600
 on childhood psychiatric disorders and challenges,

1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:21.980
 but many children develop OCD early,

1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:24.240
 as young as three or four, believe it or not,

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.000
 or even six or seven and 10,

1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.840
 and in adolescence and certainly around puberty

1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:31.400
 and in young adulthood, it is rare,

1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:32.560
 although it does happen,

1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:34.940
 that people will develop OCD very late in life,

1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:37.680
 around 40 or older, just kind of spontaneously.

1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:39.560
 Most often, when you look at their clinical history,

1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:41.560
 you find that either they were hiding it

1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:43.300
 or it was being suppressed in some way,

1:59:43.300 --> 1:59:46.080
 or if it does spontaneously show up late in life,

1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:49.020
 like mid-30s or in one's 40s,

1:59:50.040 --> 1:59:52.520
 typically there's a traumatic brain injury,

1:59:52.520 --> 1:59:55.220
 could be due to stroke or physical injury to the head

1:59:55.220 --> 1:59:57.120
 or something of that sort.

1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:00.600
 Nonetheless, there is a interesting correlation

2:00:00.600 --> 2:00:03.320
 between the onset of puberty in certain forms of OCD.

2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:05.380
 There's certain forms of, or I should say,

2:00:05.380 --> 2:00:08.120
 there's certain aspects of menopause that can relate to OCD.

2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:10.220
 You can find all these things in the literature,

2:00:10.220 --> 2:00:13.120
 all this to say that hormones impact neurotransmitters

2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:15.000
 and neuromodulators, which clearly impact

2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.200
 the kinds of circuits that are involved in OCD,

2:00:17.200 --> 2:00:19.080
 and it makes sense that,

2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:21.600
 and I would hope that there would be an exploration

2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:23.360
 of how these hormones impact OCD

2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:24.700
 in the not too distant future.

2:00:24.700 --> 2:00:26.080
 Now, there is an extensive literature

2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:27.940
 exploring how testosterone therapy,

2:00:27.940 --> 2:00:30.320
 both in males and females,

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:33.360
 can be effective in some cases

2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:36.520
 in the treatment of anxiety-related disorders,

2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:40.120
 but not, at least to my knowledge, in OCD in particular.

2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:43.100
 So this whole area of the use of testosterone

2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:46.280
 and estrogen therapy is DHEA, cortisol suppression,

2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:49.860
 or maybe even enhancement for the treatment of OCD

2:00:49.860 --> 2:00:54.240
 is essentially a big black box that very soon, I believe,

2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:56.520
 will be lit.

2:00:56.520 --> 2:00:58.880
 I realize that a number of listeners of this podcast

2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:02.560
 are probably interested in the non-typical

2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:04.660
 or holistic treatments for OCD.

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.860
 Dr. Blair Simpson's lab has at least one study

2:01:07.860 --> 2:01:11.360
 exploring the role of mindfulness meditation

2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:14.280
 for the treatment of OCD.

2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:17.300
 There, the data are a little bit complicated,

2:01:17.300 --> 2:01:21.280
 and I should mention that good things are happening,

2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:24.020
 at least in the United States, probably elsewhere as well,

2:01:24.020 --> 2:01:25.480
 but good things are happening

2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:29.040
 in terms of the exploration of things like meditation

2:01:29.040 --> 2:01:31.120
 and other, let's call them non-traditional

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:34.640
 or holistic forms of treatment for psychiatric disorders

2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:37.160
 because of the division of complementary health

2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:38.320
 that's now been launched

2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:39.600
 by the National Institutes of Health.

2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:43.520
 So whereas before people would think about meditation

2:01:43.520 --> 2:01:48.520
 or yoga nidra or even CBD supplementation for that matter

2:01:48.660 --> 2:01:50.920
 as kind of fringe maybe, or kind of woo,

2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:53.620
 or non-traditional at the very least,

2:01:53.620 --> 2:01:55.640
 the National Institutes of Health in the United States

2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:59.200
 has now devoted an entire division,

2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:02.360
 an entire institute purely for the exploration

2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:04.700
 of things like breathing practices, meditation, et cetera.

2:02:04.700 --> 2:02:06.120
 So there's a cancer institute,

2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:07.840
 there's a hearing and deafness institute,

2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:09.520
 there's a vision institute,

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:11.560
 and now there's this complementary health institute,

2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:14.560
 which I think is a wonderful addition

2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:17.960
 to the more traditional aspects of medicine.

2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:21.960
 I think no possible useful treatment should be overlooked

2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:23.680
 or unresearched in my opinion,

2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:25.780
 provided that can be done safely.

2:02:25.780 --> 2:02:28.600
 And as I mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab

2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:31.600
 has looked at the role of mindfulness meditation

2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:33.280
 in the treatment of OCD.

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:36.940
 Now we should all keep in mind, no pun intended,

2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:39.880
 that most of the data on mindfulness meditation

2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:43.800
 shows that it increases the ability to focus.

2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:46.400
 Now this brings us back to a kind of repeating theme today,

2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:49.280
 which is that increased focus may not be the best thing

2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:54.080
 for somebody with OCD because it might increase focus

2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:57.000
 on the obsession and or compulsion.

2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:59.640
 Turns out that mindfulness meditation can be useful

2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:00.960
 in the treatment of OCD,

2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:05.960
 but mainly by way of how it impacts the focus on

2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:10.000
 and the ability to engage in cognitive behavioral therapies.

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.260
 So it's very unlikely, at least by my read of the data,

2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:15.520
 to be a direct effect of meditation

2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:16.660
 on relieving the symptoms.

2:03:16.660 --> 2:03:19.500
 Rather, it seems that meditation is increasing focus

2:03:19.500 --> 2:03:23.000
 on things like cognitive behavioral therapy homework

2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:24.680
 and to not focus on other things

2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:28.080
 and therefore indirectly improving the symptoms of OCD.

2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:29.880
 Now, somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,

2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:32.600
 there have also been a fairly large number of studies

2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:35.560
 exploring how nutraceuticals,

2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:36.440
 as they're sometimes called,

2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:38.600
 supplements that are available over the counter

2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:41.720
 can impact the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder.

2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:44.960
 Now there's such an extensive number of different compounds

2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:47.280
 and supplements that fall under the category

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:49.260
 of nutraceuticals and that have been explored

2:03:49.260 --> 2:03:51.060
 in the treatment of OCD that I'd like to point you

2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:53.640
 to a review that is entitled

2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:54.920
 Nutraceuticals and the Treatment

2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:56.960
 of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.480
 a Review, excuse me, of Mechanistic and Clinical Evidence.

2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:04.440
 This was published in 2011, so it's over 10 years old.

2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:07.360
 And so by now, I have to imagine that there are

2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:10.240
 an enormous number of additional substances

2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:11.400
 that could be explored.

2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:14.360
 But there are just one or two here that I want to focus on.

2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:18.160
 Here in this review, they describe effects of 5-HTP

2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:21.040
 and tryptophan, so things that are in the serotonin pathway,

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:23.880
 which would make sense given what we know about the SSRIs

2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:26.000
 that people would explore how different supplements

2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:30.320
 that increase serotonergic transmission might impact OCD.

2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:32.980
 What you find is that they do have significant effects

2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:36.680
 in improving or reducing the symptoms of OCD

2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:39.400
 in somewhat similar way to some of the SSRIs.

2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:41.280
 But you of course have to be careful.

2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:44.180
 So anything that's going to tap into

2:04:44.180 --> 2:04:46.820
 a given neurochemical system to the same degree

2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:50.120
 may very likely have the same sorts of side effects

2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:51.620
 that a prescription drug would.

2:04:51.620 --> 2:04:53.420
 One compound that I'd like to focus on

2:04:53.420 --> 2:04:54.700
 in a little more depth, however,

2:04:54.700 --> 2:04:59.240
 because it's exciting and interesting to me is inositol.

2:04:59.240 --> 2:05:01.360
 Inositol is a compound that we are going to talk about

2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:05.060
 in several future podcasts because, well, first of all,

2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:07.420
 it seems that it can have pretty impressive effects

2:05:07.420 --> 2:05:09.000
 on reducing anxiety.

2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:10.540
 It also can have pretty impressive effects

2:05:10.540 --> 2:05:13.340
 in improving fertility in particular in women

2:05:13.340 --> 2:05:15.820
 with polycystic ovarian syndrome.

2:05:15.820 --> 2:05:18.540
 And here I'm referring specifically to myoinositol

2:05:18.540 --> 2:05:20.140
 because it comes in several forms.

2:05:20.140 --> 2:05:23.740
 And it does appear that 900 milligrams of inositol

2:05:23.740 --> 2:05:26.940
 can improve sleep and can reduce anxiety

2:05:26.940 --> 2:05:30.200
 perhaps when taken at that dosage or higher dosages.

2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:33.240
 I will just confess, first of all, I don't have OCD,

2:05:33.240 --> 2:05:35.480
 although I will also confess that when I was a child,

2:05:35.480 --> 2:05:37.180
 I had a transient tic.

2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:39.080
 I've talked about this on podcasts before.

2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:40.120
 It was a grunting tic.

2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:41.440
 So when I was about six or seven,

2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:44.740
 I recall a trip to Washington, D.C. with my family

2:05:44.740 --> 2:05:49.740
 where I was feeling a strong desire or need even,

2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:53.760
 as I recall, to grunt in order to clear something

2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:56.160
 in my throat, but I didn't have anything in my throat.

2:05:56.160 --> 2:05:58.080
 I didn't have a cold or any post-nasal drip.

2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:00.080
 It was really just the feeling that I needed to do that

2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:02.360
 to release some sort of tension.

2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:05.280
 And I remember my dad at the time telling me,

2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:06.720
 don't do that, don't do that.

2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:08.600
 It's not good to grunt or something like that.

2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:11.120
 I think he saw that it was kind of compulsive behavior.

2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:12.880
 And so I would actually hide in the backseat

2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:15.300
 of the rental car and do it, or I'd hide in my room.

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.020
 Fortunately for me, it was transient.

2:06:17.020 --> 2:06:19.680
 I think about six months or a year later, it disappeared.

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:22.760
 Although I did notice, actually an ex-girlfriend of mine

2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:24.500
 pointed out that when I get very tired

2:06:24.500 --> 2:06:26.040
 and I've been working very long hours,

2:06:26.040 --> 2:06:28.560
 sometimes that grunting tic will reappear.

2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:29.400
 What does that mean?

2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:30.320
 Do I have Tourette's?

2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:31.520
 I don't know, maybe.

2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:32.760
 I was never diagnosed with Tourette's.

2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:34.120
 Do I have OCD?

2:06:34.120 --> 2:06:35.440
 Maybe.

2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:37.100
 I certainly could be accused of having

2:06:37.100 --> 2:06:39.320
 obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:42.360
 which we'll talk about still in a few minutes.

2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:45.200
 But the point here is that many children

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:49.720
 transiently express tics or low-level Tourette's or OCD,

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:52.680
 and again, transiently and it disappears over time.

2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:54.800
 So inositol has been explored

2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:56.240
 in a bunch of different contexts,

2:06:56.240 --> 2:06:58.880
 including for tics and OCD, et cetera.

2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:03.300
 Going back to inositol and its current use,

2:07:03.300 --> 2:07:04.360
 or I should say my current use,

2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:07.200
 I've been taking 900 milligrams of inositol

2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:10.680
 as an addition to my existing toolkit for sleep,

2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:13.240
 which I've talked about many times on this podcast

2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:14.480
 and other podcasts,

2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:18.240
 consists of magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine.

2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:19.680
 If you want to know more about that kit,

2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:21.360
 you can go to our newsletter,

2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:23.580
 neural network newsletter at hubermanlab.com.

2:07:23.580 --> 2:07:24.800
 The toolkit for sleep is there.

2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:26.480
 You don't even have to sign up for the newsletter,

2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:27.880
 but it'll give you a flavor of the sorts of things

2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:29.040
 that are in the newsletter.

2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:32.960
 In any case, I've been experimenting a bit

2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:35.520
 with taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol,

2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:37.600
 either alone or in combination with that sleep kit.

2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:39.880
 And I must say the sleep I've been getting on inositol

2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:43.440
 is extremely deep and does seem to lead

2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:46.000
 to enhanced levels of focus and alertness during the day.

2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:46.920
 And perhaps you're noticing that

2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:48.480
 because I'm talking more quickly on this podcast

2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:49.440
 than in previous podcasts.

2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:50.260
 No, I'm just kidding.

2:07:50.260 --> 2:07:51.400
 I don't think the two things relate

2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:53.360
 in any kind of causal way.

2:07:53.360 --> 2:07:55.420
 The point here is that inositol

2:07:55.420 --> 2:07:59.360
 is known to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety,

2:07:59.360 --> 2:08:01.360
 but when taken at very high dosages.

2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:03.080
 Can it do the same at low dosages?

2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:03.920
 We don't know.

2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:06.560
 I would consider 900 milligrams a low dose.

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:08.760
 Most of this, given the fact

2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:11.800
 that most of the studies of inositol

2:08:11.800 --> 2:08:13.400
 have explored very high dosages,

2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:16.340
 like even 10 or 12 grams per day,

2:08:16.340 --> 2:08:18.760
 which I must say seems exceedingly high.

2:08:18.760 --> 2:08:20.500
 And they do report that some of the subjects

2:08:20.500 --> 2:08:23.360
 in those experiments actually stopped taking the inositol

2:08:23.360 --> 2:08:24.980
 because of gastric discomfort

2:08:24.980 --> 2:08:27.540
 or gastric distress as it's called.

2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:30.100
 So I've reported my results with sleep

2:08:30.100 --> 2:08:32.160
 in a kind of anecdotal way.

2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:33.520
 They certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies

2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:35.640
 that I described about my own experience

2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:36.880
 in an anecdotal way.

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.960
 But nonetheless, it's been explored

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:42.720
 that things like glycine, which is another,

2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:43.800
 which is an amino acid,

2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:45.760
 which also acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter

2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:47.400
 in the brain, taken at very high dose,

2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:49.140
 just 60 grams per day.

2:08:49.140 --> 2:08:52.840
 That is a absolutely astonishingly high amount of glycine.

2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:55.080
 I would not recommend taking that much glycine

2:08:55.080 --> 2:08:57.120
 unless you're part of a study where they tell you to

2:08:57.120 --> 2:08:58.940
 and you know it's safe.

2:08:58.940 --> 2:09:01.960
 18 grams, excuse me, of inositol.

2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:04.700
 These are very, very high dosages used in these studies.

2:09:04.700 --> 2:09:08.520
 Nonetheless, there's some interesting data about inositol

2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:13.520
 leading to some alleviation of OCD symptoms

2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:16.520
 or partial alleviation of OCD symptoms

2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.520
 in as little as two weeks

2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:21.760
 after initiating the supplement protocol.

2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:23.960
 So I think there's a great future for these nutraceuticals,

2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:26.040
 meaning I think more systematic exploration

2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:27.360
 in particular of lower dosages

2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:29.800
 in the context of OCD treatment.

2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:33.720
 And as we saw before for the SSRIs

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:35.580
 and other prescription drug treatments,

2:09:35.580 --> 2:09:37.680
 I think there really needs to be an exploration

2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:39.620
 of these nutraceuticals in combination

2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:41.120
 with behavioral therapies and who knows,

2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:42.480
 maybe with brain-machine interface

2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:45.220
 like cranial magnetic stimulation as well.

2:09:45.220 --> 2:09:47.120
 Now, way back at the beginning of the episode,

2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:50.420
 I alluded to the fact that OCD is one thing,

2:09:50.420 --> 2:09:52.860
 obsessive compulsive disorder, and it's truly a disorder,

2:09:52.860 --> 2:09:55.600
 and it's truly debilitating, and it's extremely common.

2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:58.000
 And then there's this other thing

2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.360
 called obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:01.900
 which is distinct from that,

2:10:01.900 --> 2:10:05.000
 does not have the intrusive component.

2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:06.600
 So people don't feel overwhelmed

2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:09.640
 or overtaken by these thoughts.

2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:12.480
 Rather, they find that the obsessions

2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:15.560
 can sometimes serve them or they even welcome them.

2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:17.660
 And I think many of us know people like this.

2:10:17.660 --> 2:10:20.120
 I perhaps even could be accused or who knows,

2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:21.600
 maybe have been accused of having

2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:25.020
 an obsessive compulsive personality at times.

2:10:25.020 --> 2:10:26.200
 Why do I draw this distinction?

2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:30.000
 Well, first of all, we've come to a point in human history,

2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.580
 I think in large part because of social media,

2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:34.920
 but also in large part because there are a number

2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:37.680
 of discussions being held about mental health

2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:42.680
 that have brought terms like trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera

2:10:43.420 --> 2:10:47.200
 into the common vernacular so that people will say,

2:10:47.200 --> 2:10:49.680
 oh, you're so OCD, or someone will say,

2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:53.040
 I was traumatized by that, or I was traumatized by this.

2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:54.440
 We should be very careful, right?

2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:56.760
 I'm certainly not the word police,

2:10:56.760 --> 2:10:59.640
 but we should be very careful in the use

2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:01.540
 of certain types of language,

2:11:01.540 --> 2:11:05.140
 especially language that has real psychiatric

2:11:05.140 --> 2:11:09.080
 and psychological definitions because it can really draw us

2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.900
 off course in providing relief for some of these syndromes.

2:11:11.900 --> 2:11:15.520
 For instance, the word trauma is thrown around left

2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:17.680
 and right nowadays, I was traumatized by this,

2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:20.500
 or that caused trauma, or you're giving me trauma.

2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:23.800
 Listen, I realize that many people are traumatized

2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:26.600
 by certain events, including things that are said to them.

2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:27.940
 I absolutely acknowledge that,

2:11:27.940 --> 2:11:31.040
 hence our episodes on trauma and trauma treatment,

2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:35.920
 several of them in fact, Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,

2:11:35.920 --> 2:11:39.120
 and then dedicated solo episodes with just me blabbing

2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:41.640
 about trauma and trauma treatment.

2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:44.920
 But as Dr. Conti so appropriately pointed out,

2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:50.780
 trauma is really something that changes our neural circuitry

2:11:50.780 --> 2:11:52.640
 and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors

2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:55.500
 in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us.

2:11:55.500 --> 2:11:57.620
 Not every bad event is traumatizing,

2:11:57.620 --> 2:11:59.840
 not everything that we dislike or even that we hate

2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:02.020
 or that feels terrible to us is traumatizing.

2:12:02.020 --> 2:12:04.840
 For something to reach the level of trauma,

2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:07.680
 it really needs to change our neural circuitry

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:09.640
 and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors

2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:12.560
 in a persistent way that is maladaptive for us.

2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:17.160
 Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing,

2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:20.080
 saying that someone has OCD or assuming one has OCD

2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:22.960
 simply because they have a personality or a phenotype,

2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:25.240
 as we say, where they need things in perfect order.

2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:27.040
 Like I find myself correcting these pens,

2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:30.420
 making sure that the caps are facing in the same direction,

2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:32.600
 for instance, right now.

2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:35.240
 That is not the same as OCD.

2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:37.160
 If, for instance, I can tolerate these pens

2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:38.420
 being at different orientation

2:12:38.420 --> 2:12:40.200
 or even throw the cap on the floor or something,

2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:42.000
 it doesn't create a lot of anxiety for me.

2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.160
 I confess I agree it's a little bit in the moment,

2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:45.960
 then I can forget about it and move on.

2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:47.680
 That's one of the key distinctions

2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:50.600
 between obsessive compulsive personality disorder

2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:54.800
 and obsessive compulsive disorder in its strictest form.

2:12:54.800 --> 2:12:56.880
 Now, once one hears that OCD

2:12:56.880 --> 2:12:59.880
 is different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder

2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:01.040
 because of this difference

2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:03.680
 in how intrusive the thoughts are or not,

2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:05.360
 then that's useful,

2:13:05.360 --> 2:13:07.200
 but it really doesn't tell us anything

2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:09.400
 about what is happening mechanistically

2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:11.520
 in one situation or another.

2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:13.480
 Fortunately, there are beautiful data,

2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:15.720
 again, from Dr. Blair Simpson's lab,

2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:17.900
 and you can tell based on the number of studies

2:13:17.900 --> 2:13:19.560
 that I've referred to from her laboratory,

2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:22.880
 that she's truly one of the luminaries in this field,

2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:26.740
 that there really are some fundamental wiring differences

2:13:26.740 --> 2:13:29.540
 and behavioral differences and psychological differences

2:13:29.540 --> 2:13:32.360
 between people who have obsessive compulsive disorder

2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:34.160
 and those who have obsessive compulsive

2:13:34.160 --> 2:13:36.440
 personality disorder.

2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:39.960
 So this is a study first authored by Pinto, P-I-N-T-O,

2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:42.200
 entitled Capacity to Delay Reward

2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:44.200
 Differentiates Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:47.400
 and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.

2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:48.720
 And the methods in this study

2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:50.860
 were to take 25 people with OCD

2:13:50.860 --> 2:13:54.800
 and 25 people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder

2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:57.360
 and 25 people who have both

2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:58.840
 because it is possible to have both,

2:13:58.840 --> 2:13:59.920
 and that's important to point out,

2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:02.000
 and 25 so-called healthy controls,

2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:02.840
 people that don't have

2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:04.600
 obsessive compulsive personality disorder

2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:07.160
 or obsessive compulsive disorder.

2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:08.720
 They take clinical assessments,

2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:11.200
 and then they took a number of tests

2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:15.680
 that probed their ability to defer gratification,

2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:17.020
 something called, in the laboratory,

2:14:17.020 --> 2:14:18.560
 we call it delayed discounting,

2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:22.200
 so their ability to defer gratification

2:14:22.200 --> 2:14:24.740
 through a task where they can either accept reward

2:14:24.740 --> 2:14:26.400
 right away or accept reward later.

2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:28.880
 Some of you may have heard of the two-marshmallow task.

2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:31.560
 This is based on a study that was performed years ago

2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:33.700
 on young children at Stanford and elsewhere,

2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:36.120
 where they take young children into a room,

2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:39.140
 they offer them a marshmallow,

2:14:39.140 --> 2:14:41.260
 kids like marshmallows generally,

2:14:41.260 --> 2:14:44.240
 and you say, you can eat the marshmallow right now,

2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:46.400
 or you can wait some period of time,

2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:49.360
 and if you are able to wait and not eat the marshmallow,

2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:50.960
 you can have two marshmallows.

2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:53.140
 And in general, children want two marshmallows

2:14:53.140 --> 2:14:54.660
 more than they want one marshmallow.

2:14:54.660 --> 2:14:56.360
 So really what you're probing is

2:14:56.360 --> 2:14:59.000
 their ability to access delayed gratification,

2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.520
 and they're very entertaining,

2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:06.520
 even truly amusing videos of this on the internet.

2:15:06.520 --> 2:15:09.440
 So if you just do two marshmallow task video,

2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:10.280
 and you go into YouTube,

2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:12.220
 what you'll find is that the children will use

2:15:12.220 --> 2:15:16.100
 all sorts of strategies to delay gratification.

2:15:16.100 --> 2:15:18.700
 Some of the kids will cover the marshmallow,

2:15:18.700 --> 2:15:20.340
 others will talk to the marshmallow and say,

2:15:20.340 --> 2:15:21.660
 I know you're not that delicious,

2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:23.380
 you look delicious, but no, you're not delicious.

2:15:23.380 --> 2:15:24.700
 They'll engage with the marshmallow

2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:25.740
 in all sorts of cute ways.

2:15:25.740 --> 2:15:27.920
 They'll turn around and try and, you know, avoidance,

2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:30.960
 which actually speaks to a whole category of behaviors

2:15:30.960 --> 2:15:32.580
 that people with OCD also use.

2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:34.220
 I'm not saying these kids had OCD,

2:15:34.220 --> 2:15:38.620
 but avoidance behaviors are very much a component of OCD.

2:15:38.620 --> 2:15:40.400
 People really trying to avoid the thing

2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:43.420
 that evokes the obsession.

2:15:43.420 --> 2:15:47.180
 Well, some kids are able to delay gratification, some aren't.

2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:48.640
 And it's debatable as to whether or not

2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:50.480
 the kids that are able to delay gratification

2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:52.340
 go on to have more successful lives or not.

2:15:52.340 --> 2:15:54.140
 Initially, that was the conclusion of those studies.

2:15:54.140 --> 2:15:55.380
 There's still a lot of debate about it.

2:15:55.380 --> 2:15:57.020
 We'll bring an expert on to give us

2:15:57.020 --> 2:15:58.140
 the final conclusion on this,

2:15:58.140 --> 2:15:59.680
 because there is one and it's very interesting

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.020
 and not intuitive.

2:16:01.020 --> 2:16:03.560
 Nonetheless, adults are also faced

2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:05.860
 with decisions every day, all day,

2:16:05.860 --> 2:16:08.840
 as to whether or not they can delay gratification.

2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:13.360
 And this study used a, not a two-marshmallow task,

2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:17.340
 but a game that involved rewards where people could delay

2:16:17.340 --> 2:16:19.280
 in order to get greater rewards later.

2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:20.640
 What is the conclusion?

2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:23.000
 Well, first of all, obsessive compulsive

2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.980
 and obsessive compulsive personality disorder subjects

2:16:25.980 --> 2:16:30.660
 both showed impairments in their psychosocial functioning

2:16:30.660 --> 2:16:31.820
 and quality of life.

2:16:31.820 --> 2:16:34.240
 They had compulsive behavior.

2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:36.300
 So these are people that are suffering in their life

2:16:36.300 --> 2:16:39.060
 because their compulsions are really strong.

2:16:39.060 --> 2:16:41.260
 So it's not just being really nitpicky

2:16:41.260 --> 2:16:42.580
 or really orderly in one case

2:16:42.580 --> 2:16:44.140
 and having full-blown OCD in the other,

2:16:44.140 --> 2:16:47.300
 both sets of subjects are challenged in life

2:16:47.300 --> 2:16:49.100
 because they're having relationship issues

2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:50.660
 or job-related issues, et cetera,

2:16:50.660 --> 2:16:52.360
 because they are that compulsive.

2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:54.780
 However, the individuals

2:16:54.780 --> 2:16:58.540
 with obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:16:58.540 --> 2:17:01.900
 they discounted the value of delayed gratification

2:17:01.900 --> 2:17:03.260
 significantly less than those

2:17:03.260 --> 2:17:05.360
 with obsessive compulsive disorder.

2:17:06.260 --> 2:17:07.420
 What do I mean?

2:17:07.420 --> 2:17:09.020
 They are both impairing disorders

2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:10.540
 that are marked by compulsive behaviors.

2:17:10.540 --> 2:17:12.180
 Here I'm paraphrasing,

2:17:12.180 --> 2:17:13.420
 but they can be differentiated

2:17:13.420 --> 2:17:15.460
 by the presence of obsessions in OCD.

2:17:15.460 --> 2:17:17.380
 So obsessions in OCD.

2:17:17.380 --> 2:17:22.380
 People with OCD are absolutely fixated on certain ideas

2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:24.260
 and those ideas are intrusive.

2:17:24.260 --> 2:17:26.180
 Again, that's the hallmark theme.

2:17:26.180 --> 2:17:29.180
 And by an excessive capacity to delay reward

2:17:29.180 --> 2:17:31.420
 in obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:17:31.420 --> 2:17:33.740
 that is people who have obsessive compulsive

2:17:33.740 --> 2:17:36.420
 personality disorder are really good

2:17:36.420 --> 2:17:38.180
 at delaying gratification.

2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:41.620
 So they are able to concentrate very intensely

2:17:41.620 --> 2:17:44.280
 and perform very intensely in ways

2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:46.260
 that allow them to instill order

2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:49.300
 such that they can delay reward.

2:17:49.300 --> 2:17:53.620
 Now you can see why this contour of symptoms,

2:17:53.620 --> 2:17:57.280
 meaning that the people with OCD

2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:00.880
 are experiencing intrusive thoughts,

2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:01.720
 whereas the people

2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:04.520
 with obsessive compulsive personality disorder

2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:07.800
 show an enhanced ability to defer gratification.

2:18:10.060 --> 2:18:11.360
 You could see how that would lead

2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:12.780
 to very different outcomes.

2:18:12.780 --> 2:18:15.520
 People with obsessive compulsive personality disorder

2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:18.600
 can actually leverage that personality disorder

2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:21.040
 to perform better in certain domains of life,

2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:22.160
 not all domains of life,

2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:25.320
 because remember, again, these people are in this study

2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:28.220
 and they're showing up as experiencing challenges in life

2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:31.360
 because of their obsessive compulsive personality disorder.

2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:33.800
 Nonetheless, people with obsessive compulsive

2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:35.260
 personality disorder, you can imagine,

2:18:35.260 --> 2:18:39.040
 would be very good at, say, architecture

2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:41.640
 or anything that involves instilling a ton of order,

2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:44.780
 maybe a sushi chef, for instance, maybe a chef in general.

2:18:44.780 --> 2:18:46.740
 I know chefs that just kind of throw things around

2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:48.840
 like the chef on the Muppets

2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:50.380
 and just throw things everywhere

2:18:50.380 --> 2:18:51.520
 and still produce amazing food.

2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:52.360
 And then there's some people

2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:54.240
 where they're incredibly exacting.

2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:55.760
 They're just incredibly precise.

2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:58.400
 I think that movie, what is it, Hero Dreams of Sushi,

2:18:58.400 --> 2:19:00.360
 that movie is incredible.

2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:01.720
 Certainly not saying he has obsessive

2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:03.040
 compulsive personality disorder,

2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:06.440
 but I think it's fair to say that he is obsessive

2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.120
 or extremely meticulous and orderly

2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:10.920
 about everything from start to finish.

2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:13.720
 You can imagine a huge array of different occupations

2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:16.320
 and life endeavors where this would be beneficial,

2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:17.480
 science being one of them,

2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:19.640
 where data collection and analysis

2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:22.000
 is exceedingly important that one be precise,

2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:25.660
 or mathematics or physics or engineering,

2:19:25.660 --> 2:19:28.180
 anything where precision has a payoff

2:19:28.180 --> 2:19:31.360
 and gaining precision takes time

2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:34.180
 and delay of immediate gratification,

2:19:34.180 --> 2:19:35.740
 you can imagine that obsessive compulsive

2:19:35.740 --> 2:19:38.040
 personality disorder would synergize well

2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:40.180
 with those sorts of activities and professions.

2:19:40.180 --> 2:19:43.080
 Whereas obsessive compulsive disorder is really intrusive.

2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:45.420
 It's preventing functionality

2:19:45.420 --> 2:19:47.680
 in many different domains of life.

2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:51.300
 So the key takeaway here is that

2:19:51.300 --> 2:19:53.680
 when we use the words obsessive compulsive,

2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:55.520
 or we call someone obsessive compulsive,

2:19:55.520 --> 2:19:57.220
 or we are trying to evaluate whether or not

2:19:57.220 --> 2:19:58.440
 we are obsessive compulsive,

2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:02.200
 it's very important that we highlight

2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.480
 that obsessive compulsive disorder is very intrusive.

2:20:05.480 --> 2:20:06.720
 It involves intrusive thoughts

2:20:06.720 --> 2:20:09.080
 and it interrupts with normal functioning in life.

2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:11.440
 Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:20:11.440 --> 2:20:14.220
 while it can interrupt normal functioning in life,

2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:16.560
 it also can be productive.

2:20:16.560 --> 2:20:18.120
 It can enhance functioning in life,

2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:21.080
 not just in work, but perhaps at home as well.

2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:23.400
 If you are somebody and you have family members

2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:24.800
 that really place enormous value

2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:27.540
 on having a beautiful and highly organized home,

2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:29.900
 well, then it could lend itself well to that.

2:20:29.900 --> 2:20:31.560
 It's going to be a matter of degrees, of course.

2:20:31.560 --> 2:20:33.120
 None of these things is an absolute,

2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:34.260
 it's going to be on a continuum.

2:20:34.260 --> 2:20:35.480
 But I think it is fair to say

2:20:35.480 --> 2:20:37.480
 that obsessive compulsive disorder,

2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:40.380
 whether or not in mild, moderate or severe form,

2:20:40.380 --> 2:20:43.360
 is impairing normal functioning.

2:20:43.360 --> 2:20:45.900
 Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:20:45.900 --> 2:20:48.240
 there's a range of expressions of that,

2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:49.540
 some of which can be adaptive,

2:20:49.540 --> 2:20:51.000
 some of which can be maladaptive.

2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.640
 And again, it's all going to depend on context.

2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:56.580
 Before we conclude, I do want to touch on something

2:20:56.580 --> 2:20:58.480
 that I think a lot of people experience,

2:20:58.480 --> 2:21:00.560
 and that's superstitions.

2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:02.040
 Superstitions are fascinating

2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:05.600
 and there's some fascinating research on superstitions.

2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:08.620
 One particular study that I'm a big fan of

2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:11.200
 is the work of Ben Solevsky at Harvard.

2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:14.520
 He studies motor sequences and motor learning.

2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:17.520
 And he has beautiful data on how people learn,

2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:19.480
 for instance, a tennis swing

2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:23.120
 and the patterns that they engage in early on.

2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:24.640
 And then the patterns of swinging,

2:21:24.640 --> 2:21:26.620
 that they, swinging the racket, that is,

2:21:26.620 --> 2:21:29.680
 that they engage in later as they acquire more skill.

2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:32.920
 And basically the takeaway is that the amount of error

2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:36.960
 or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced

2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:38.140
 as they acquire skill.

2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:41.320
 That's all fine and good.

2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:43.600
 And there's some beautiful mechanistic data

2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:46.120
 that he and others have discovered

2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:48.200
 to support how that comes to be.

2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:50.900
 But they also explore animal models,

2:21:50.900 --> 2:21:54.800
 in particular, rats pressing sequences of buttons

2:21:54.800 --> 2:21:57.300
 and levers to obtain a reward.

2:21:57.300 --> 2:21:59.480
 Believe it or not, rats are pretty smart.

2:21:59.480 --> 2:22:00.920
 I've seen this with my own eyes.

2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:04.400
 You can teach a rat to press a lever for a pellet of food.

2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:09.160
 Rats can also learn to press levers in a particular sequence

2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:11.280
 in order to gain a piece of food.

2:22:11.280 --> 2:22:15.320
 And they can actually learn to press an enormous number

2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:17.200
 of levers in very particular sequences

2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:19.180
 in order to obtain pellets of food.

2:22:19.180 --> 2:22:21.520
 You can also give them little buttons to press

2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:25.880
 or even a paddle to, or I should say a pedal, excuse me,

2:22:25.880 --> 2:22:27.360
 to stomp on with their foot

2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:29.160
 in order to obtain a pedal of food.

2:22:29.160 --> 2:22:32.080
 Basically, rats can learn exactly what they need to do

2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:34.720
 in order to obtain a piece of food,

2:22:34.720 --> 2:22:37.520
 especially if they're made a little bit hungry first.

2:22:37.520 --> 2:22:40.880
 Benson's lab has published beautiful data showing

2:22:40.880 --> 2:22:43.600
 that as animals and humans

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:45.760
 come to learn a particular motor sequence,

2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:49.040
 very often they will introduce motor patterns

2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:52.840
 in that sequence that are irrelevant to the outcome

2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:54.560
 and yet that persist.

2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:56.120
 If you've ever watched a game of baseball,

2:22:56.120 --> 2:22:58.060
 you've seen this before.

2:22:58.060 --> 2:23:00.260
 Oftentimes the pitcher up on the mound

2:23:00.260 --> 2:23:03.940
 will bring the ball to their chin,

2:23:03.940 --> 2:23:05.520
 they'll look over their shoulder,

2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:07.800
 they'll look back over the other shoulder,

2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:09.880
 and then they will, of course,

2:23:09.880 --> 2:23:11.760
 reel back and pitch the ball.

2:23:11.760 --> 2:23:13.000
 But if you watch closely,

2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.440
 oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence

2:23:15.440 --> 2:23:17.960
 which are completely unrelated to the pitch.

2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:19.400
 They're not looking necessarily

2:23:19.400 --> 2:23:21.120
 to see if someone's stealing a base.

2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:24.200
 They're not necessarily looking down at home plate

2:23:24.200 --> 2:23:25.980
 where the batter is.

2:23:25.980 --> 2:23:28.640
 They're also doing things like touching the back of their ear

2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:30.480
 before they bring the ball to their chin

2:23:30.480 --> 2:23:31.600
 or adjusting their hat.

2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.240
 And if you watch individual pitchers,

2:23:33.240 --> 2:23:35.240
 what you'll find is that they'll do the same sequence

2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:38.260
 of completely irrelevant motor patterns

2:23:38.260 --> 2:23:40.560
 before each and every single pitch.

2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:43.880
 Similarly, rats that have been trained to, for instance,

2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:47.040
 hit two levers and step on a pedal

2:23:47.040 --> 2:23:49.120
 with their left hind foot,

2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:53.180
 and then tap a button up above that is the red button,

2:23:53.180 --> 2:23:55.640
 will do that to gain a piece of food.

2:23:55.640 --> 2:23:57.680
 But sometimes they'll also introduce a pattern

2:23:57.680 --> 2:23:58.960
 into that motor sequence

2:23:58.960 --> 2:24:01.660
 where they will shake their tail a little bit,

2:24:01.660 --> 2:24:02.760
 or they'll turn their head a little bit,

2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:05.620
 or they'll move their ears a little bit, et cetera.

2:24:05.620 --> 2:24:08.920
 Motor patterns that have nothing to do with obtaining

2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:10.940
 the particular outcome in mind.

2:24:10.940 --> 2:24:13.560
 In other words, you could eliminate certain components

2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:15.380
 of the motor sequence and it would not matter.

2:24:15.380 --> 2:24:16.580
 The rat would still get the pellet.

2:24:16.580 --> 2:24:19.520
 The pitcher would still be able to pitch.

2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:21.740
 And yet that can introduce because somehow,

2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:25.680
 because they were performed again and again,

2:24:25.680 --> 2:24:28.800
 prior to successful trials,

2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:32.400
 the rat or the human baseball pitcher

2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:34.420
 comes to believe in some way

2:24:34.420 --> 2:24:37.160
 that it was involved in generating the outcome,

2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:39.100
 hence superstition, right?

2:24:39.100 --> 2:24:41.360
 I confess I have a few superstitions.

2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:43.440
 I occasionally will knock on wood.

2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:45.000
 I'll say something that I want to happen

2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.040
 and I'll say, oh, knock on wood, and I'll just do it.

2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:49.600
 And occasionally I'll challenge myself and think,

2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:50.640
 ah, I don't want to knock,

2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:52.280
 don't knock on wood, Andrew, don't do that.

2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:53.280
 You know, no one,

2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:55.320
 I don't think anyone wants to be superstitious.

2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:56.240
 I certainly don't.

2:24:56.240 --> 2:24:57.980
 And so every once in a while, I'll just challenge it

2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:00.880
 and I won't actually knock on wood.

2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:05.460
 I'm admitting this to you to kind of normalize some of this.

2:25:05.460 --> 2:25:09.180
 Some people have superstitions that border on

2:25:09.180 --> 2:25:12.000
 or even become compulsions.

2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.880
 They really come to believe that if they don't knock on wood

2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:16.300
 that something terrible is going to happen,

2:25:16.300 --> 2:25:18.200
 maybe something in particular,

2:25:18.200 --> 2:25:19.860
 or in the case of the baseball pitcher,

2:25:19.860 --> 2:25:21.560
 they come to believe that if they don't touch

2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:24.560
 their right ear before they reel back on the pitch,

2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:27.840
 that the pitch won't be any good

2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:29.120
 or that they're going to lose the game.

2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:30.520
 I don't know what their thought process is.

2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:32.720
 Now, I also don't know what the rat is thinking,

2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:36.160
 but the rat is clearly doing something

2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:40.000
 or thinking something is related to the final outcome.

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.240
 I don't know of any studies where they've intervened

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:46.000
 with the particular superstition-like behaviors of the rat

2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.620
 to see whether or not the rat somehow doesn't continue

2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:51.320
 to do the motor sequence to get the pellet.

2:25:51.320 --> 2:25:52.160
 We don't know.

2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:53.440
 The rats, I don't speak rat.

2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:54.280
 Most people don't.

2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:56.400
 Or if you speak to a rat, if it speaks back,

2:25:56.400 --> 2:25:57.240
 it's not in English.

2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:01.480
 Anyway, the point is that superstitions are beliefs

2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:05.840
 that we on an individual scale come to believe

2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:09.480
 are linked to the probability of an outcome

2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:11.560
 when in fact we know,

2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:14.000
 we actually know in our rational minds,

2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.960
 they have no real relationship to the outcome.

2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.960
 Superstitions can become full-blown compulsions

2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:25.160
 and obsessions when we repeat them often enough

2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:26.560
 that they become automatic.

2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:28.840
 And I think this is what we observe most of the time

2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:31.360
 when we see a pitcher touching their ear,

2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:33.680
 or for instance, in tennis, you see this a lot.

2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:36.940
 You'll see someone, they'll slap their shoes often.

2:26:36.940 --> 2:26:37.780
 I see this.

2:26:37.780 --> 2:26:39.540
 They'll slap the undersides of their soles.

2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:41.680
 They may tell themselves that this is, I don't know,

2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:43.520
 maybe moving out some of the dust or something

2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:45.700
 in the bottoms of their soles that gives them more traction

2:26:45.700 --> 2:26:47.520
 and they want that to be ready for the serve

2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:48.900
 or something like that.

2:26:48.900 --> 2:26:50.280
 And maybe there's some truth to that.

2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:53.440
 But here, what we're referring to are behaviors

2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:56.120
 that really have no rational relationship to the outcome.

2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:58.360
 And yet we perform in a compulsive way.

2:26:59.580 --> 2:27:03.340
 People with OCD, yes, tend to have more superstitions.

2:27:03.340 --> 2:27:05.520
 People with more superstitions, yes,

2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:08.360
 tend to have a tendency towards OCD.

2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:10.680
 And I should mention obsessive compulsive

2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:12.120
 personality disorder.

2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:15.760
 If you think way back to the first part of this episode,

2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:17.960
 when I was just describing what the brain does, right?

2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:18.780
 What does your brain do?

2:27:18.780 --> 2:27:20.680
 Housekeeping functions to keep you alive.

2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:22.960
 And it's a prediction machine.

2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:26.640
 Your neural circuits, you have an enormous amount

2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:29.200
 of biological investment of real estate,

2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:31.680
 literally cells and chemicals that are there

2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:34.600
 to try and make your world predictable

2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:36.560
 and to try and give you control

2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:39.340
 or at least the sense of control over that world.

2:27:39.340 --> 2:27:42.300
 And that's a normal process.

2:27:42.300 --> 2:27:45.880
 Low-level superstitions, moderate superstitions

2:27:45.880 --> 2:27:50.100
 represent a kind of a healthy range, I would say,

2:27:50.100 --> 2:27:55.080
 of behaviors that are aimed at generating predictability

2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:57.200
 that don't disrupt normal function.

2:27:57.200 --> 2:27:59.160
 Obsessive compulsive personality disorder,

2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:00.360
 provided it's not too severe,

2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:02.520
 would, I think, represent the next level

2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:04.420
 along that continuum.

2:28:04.420 --> 2:28:06.280
 And then obsessive compulsive disorder,

2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:07.720
 as I pointed out earlier,

2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:10.000
 is really a case of highly debilitating,

2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:14.180
 highly intrusive, really overtake of neural circuitry

2:28:14.180 --> 2:28:15.520
 over our thoughts and behaviors

2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:19.800
 that requires very dedicated, very persistent.

2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:22.160
 And very effective treatments

2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:25.160
 in order to stop those obsessions and compulsions

2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:29.120
 and the anxiety that links them somewhat counterintuitively

2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:31.580
 by teaching people to tolerate

2:28:31.580 --> 2:28:33.320
 that level of increased anxiety

2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:35.000
 and interrupt those patterns.

2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:36.980
 Unfortunately, as we described earlier,

2:28:36.980 --> 2:28:38.340
 such treatments exist.

2:28:38.340 --> 2:28:42.060
 Cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,

2:28:42.060 --> 2:28:43.340
 though also drug treatments

2:28:43.340 --> 2:28:46.240
 that tap into the glutamate system

2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:49.600
 and into perhaps also the dopamine system,

2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:50.880
 the so-called neuroleptics.

2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:53.280
 And then, as we described,

2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:54.920
 there's now an extensive exploration

2:28:54.920 --> 2:28:58.200
 of things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis.

2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:00.380
 The initial studies don't seem to hold much promise

2:29:00.380 --> 2:29:02.540
 for cannabis and CBD in the treatment of OCD,

2:29:02.540 --> 2:29:04.720
 but who knows, maybe more studies will come along

2:29:04.720 --> 2:29:06.600
 that will change that story.

2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:08.080
 And then, of course, brain-machine interface

2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:10.080
 like transcranial magnetic stimulation.

2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:11.240
 And then just to remind you

2:29:11.240 --> 2:29:12.660
 what I already told you before,

2:29:12.660 --> 2:29:15.360
 combinations of behavioral and drug treatments

2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:16.600
 and brain-machine interface,

2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:18.360
 I think is really where the future lies.

2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:21.800
 Fortunately, good treatments exist.

2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:24.960
 We cannot say that any one individual treatment

2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:26.180
 works for everybody.

2:29:26.180 --> 2:29:29.380
 There are fairly large percentages of people

2:29:29.380 --> 2:29:31.480
 that won't respond to one set of treatments or another,

2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:34.040
 and therefore one has to try different ones.

2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:37.780
 And then there are the so-called supplementation-based

2:29:37.780 --> 2:29:39.760
 or more holistic therapies.

2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:41.920
 Today, I've tried to cover each and all of these

2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:44.880
 in a fairly substantial amount of detail.

2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:47.600
 I realize this is a fairly long episode.

2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:49.560
 That is intentional.

2:29:49.560 --> 2:29:51.740
 Much like our episode on ADHD,

2:29:51.740 --> 2:29:54.140
 on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

2:29:54.140 --> 2:29:57.840
 I received an enormous number of requests to talk about OCD.

2:29:57.840 --> 2:30:00.040
 And my decision to make this a very long

2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:03.000
 and detailed episode about OCD

2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:04.640
 really doesn't stem from any desire

2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:07.560
 to subject you to too much information

2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:11.560
 or to avoid the opportunity to just list things off.

2:30:11.560 --> 2:30:13.560
 But what I've tried to provide is an opportunity

2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:15.960
 to really drill deep into the neural circuitry

2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:18.360
 and an understanding of where OCD comes from,

2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:20.760
 how OCD is different from things like

2:30:20.760 --> 2:30:22.920
 the personality disorders that I described,

2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:25.240
 and also to give you a sense of

2:30:25.240 --> 2:30:28.360
 how the individual behavioral and drug treatments work

2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:29.900
 and perhaps don't work

2:30:29.900 --> 2:30:32.460
 so that you can really make the best informed choices.

2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:34.580
 Again, highlighting the fact that OCD

2:30:34.580 --> 2:30:37.760
 is an extremely common, extremely common,

2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:40.400
 and yet extremely debilitating condition,

2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:42.420
 and one that I hope that if any of you have

2:30:42.420 --> 2:30:44.000
 or that you know people that have it,

2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:46.920
 that you'll both gain sympathy and understanding

2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:48.160
 for what they're dealing with,

2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:50.100
 perhaps as a consequence of some of the information

2:30:50.100 --> 2:30:54.560
 presented today, and maybe help them direct their treatment,

2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:56.040
 find better treatment,

2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:59.200
 and of course apply those treatments for some relief.

2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:01.400

 That's the best way to support us.

2:31:33.900 --> 2:31:36.340
 During today's podcast and on many previous episodes

2:31:36.340 --> 2:31:39.160
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.

2:31:39.160 --> 2:31:41.320
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:43.240
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:31:43.240 --> 2:31:46.260
 for things like sleep and focus and anxiety and so on.

2:31:46.260 --> 2:31:48.120
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered

2:31:48.120 --> 2:31:50.900
 with Momentous Supplements because Momentous Supplements

2:31:50.900 --> 2:31:52.620
 are of the very highest quality.

2:31:52.620 --> 2:31:55.240
 They ship everywhere in the world, not just in the US.

2:31:55.240 --> 2:31:57.760
 And we wanted to have one location where people could go

2:31:57.760 --> 2:32:00.240
 in order to access the supplements that we describe

2:32:00.240 --> 2:32:01.960
 and detail the various roles of

2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:03.800
 here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:32:03.800 --> 2:32:06.040
 If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:07.900
 you can find those supplements.

2:32:07.900 --> 2:32:09.640
 The catalog of supplements available there

2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:11.120
 is going to be expanding quite a bit

2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:12.420
 in the weeks and months to come.

2:32:12.420 --> 2:32:13.800
 But right now already there are a number

2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:15.920
 of different supplements for enhancing focus,

2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:18.280
 enhancing sleep and so on that are available.

2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:21.000
 Again, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:22.880
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab

2:32:22.880 --> 2:32:24.720
 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

2:32:24.720 --> 2:32:27.360
 There I cover science and science related tools,

2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:29.200
 some of which overlap with the contents

2:32:29.200 --> 2:32:31.440
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast and some of which is distinct

2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:33.500
 from the content on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:32:33.500 --> 2:32:35.680
 So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram

2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:38.000
 and Huberman Lab also on Twitter.

2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:39.200
 If you haven't already subscribed

2:32:39.200 --> 2:32:40.960
 to our neural network newsletter,

2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:42.180
 this is a monthly newsletter.

2:32:42.180 --> 2:32:44.000
 It's completely zero cost.

2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:46.280
 You go to HubermanLab.com.

2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:48.720
 You go into the menu, you click on newsletter.

2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:50.320
 You can see some example newsletters.

2:32:50.320 --> 2:32:51.840
 For instance, a toolkit for sleep.

2:32:51.840 --> 2:32:53.080
 You can download that right away.

2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:54.900
 You don't even have to sign up for the newsletter.

2:32:54.900 --> 2:32:57.600
 You can get the toolkit for neuroplasticity,

2:32:57.600 --> 2:32:59.700
 for the use of cold, for the use of heat

2:32:59.700 --> 2:33:01.640
 and health and et cetera.

2:33:01.640 --> 2:33:03.640
 All of that's there and if you sign up for the newsletter,

2:33:03.640 --> 2:33:05.940
 you'll get the monthly newsletter sent to you.

2:33:05.940 --> 2:33:09.080
 We don't share your email information with anybody

2:33:09.080 --> 2:33:11.200
 and we have a very clear privacy policies there.

2:33:11.200 --> 2:33:12.960
 So again, it's the neural network newsletter

2:33:12.960 --> 2:33:16.060
 available within the newsletter tab

2:33:16.060 --> 2:33:18.440
 under the menu at HubermanLab.com.
