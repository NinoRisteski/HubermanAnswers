00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.640
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.640 --> 00:13.720
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.720 --> 00:15.760
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.520
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.520 --> 00:19.360
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.400
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.400 --> 00:24.280
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

00:24.280 --> 00:27.360
 and science-related tools to the general public.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.540
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.540 --> 00:31.480
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.760
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.180
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:37.180 --> 00:39.480
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:39.480 --> 00:41.260
 to help you better understand your body

00:41.260 --> 00:43.680
 and help you reach your health goals.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.040
 I've long been a fan of getting blood work done.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.760
 And the simple reason for that

00:47.760 --> 00:49.980
 is that most of the things that you want to know

00:49.980 --> 00:53.680
 about your health, such as hormones, metabolic factors,

00:53.680 --> 00:55.480
 blood sugar levels, et cetera,

00:55.480 --> 00:57.880
 can only be analyzed from blood.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.360
 And nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests

01:00.360 --> 01:02.520
 that can also give you valuable information

01:02.520 --> 01:05.180
 about what's going on at the cellular, molecular,

01:05.180 --> 01:08.600
 even the neural circuit level within your brain and body.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.940
 Inside Tracker makes getting blood and DNA tests easy.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.840
 You can go to a testing site where they draw your blood,

01:14.840 --> 01:16.080
 they take your DNA sample,

01:16.080 --> 01:18.640
 or they can come to your home if you prefer that.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.920
 As well, they have a really amazing dashboard.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.360
 The dashboard lets you understand

01:23.360 --> 01:25.420
 what your levels of various hormones

01:25.420 --> 01:27.320
 and metabolic factors, et cetera, mean

01:27.320 --> 01:29.000
 and what you should do about them.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.480
 And I think that that's one of the main things

01:30.480 --> 01:32.320
 that really separates Inside Tracker

01:32.320 --> 01:34.560
 apart from other blood and DNA tests.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.900
 Most tests, you get the results back,

01:36.900 --> 01:39.160
 but there are no directives about what to do specifically

01:39.160 --> 01:41.200
 in order to bring the numbers into the ranges

01:41.200 --> 01:43.320
 that you would like for your goals.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.040
 Inside Tracker makes all of that extremely simple

01:46.040 --> 01:47.800
 and extremely clear.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.320
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

01:49.320 --> 01:52.320
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.160
 And if you do that,

01:53.160 --> 01:56.460
 you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.640

01:58.640 --> 02:01.320
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

02:01.320 --> 02:04.760
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.960
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.600
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

02:09.600 --> 02:12.040
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.920
 I started taking Athletic Greens back in 2012

02:14.920 --> 02:16.080
 and I've taken it ever since.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.600
 So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.600
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

02:20.600 --> 02:22.360
 and the reason I still take it now

02:22.360 --> 02:24.400
 is that Athletic Greens really lets me cover

02:24.400 --> 02:26.480
 all my nutritional bases in terms of vitamins,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.000
 minerals, and probiotics.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.080
 There's so much data now pointing to the fact

02:30.080 --> 02:32.760
 that the gut microbiome and the gut brain access

02:32.760 --> 02:35.920
 is important for metabolism and for endocrine health.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.240
 The vitamins, minerals, and probiotics in Athletic Greens

02:39.240 --> 02:42.080
 make me feel confident that I'm covering all my bases.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.200
 I do take other supplements, but with Athletic Greens,

02:44.200 --> 02:47.400
 I know that I've got all the foundational stuff handled.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.040
 It also tastes really good, tastes fine on its own.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.680
 You can mix it with water, which is what I do.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.000
 I add a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice

02:54.000 --> 02:56.600
 because I like a little tartness flavor in there as well.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.720
 But most people just mix it with water.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.200
 It mixes up super easily.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.960
 I drink it once or twice a day, usually once mid-morning

03:02.960 --> 03:04.980
 and once again in the afternoon.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.540
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

03:06.540 --> 03:09.800
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.400
 And if you do that, you can claim their special offer,

03:12.400 --> 03:15.920
 which is a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.200
 There is now a ton of evidence that vitamin D3

03:18.200 --> 03:22.120
 is involved in countless metabolic processes,

03:22.120 --> 03:24.760
 hormonal processes that are important for overall health

03:24.760 --> 03:26.020
 and wellbeing.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.020
 Vitamin D3, you can get from the sun, of course,

03:28.020 --> 03:31.000
 but most people are deficient in vitamin D3.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.840
 So if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

03:33.840 --> 03:35.080
 you'll get the Athletic Greens,

03:35.080 --> 03:37.440
 you'll get the year supply of vitamin D3 and K2,

03:37.440 --> 03:40.320
 and you'll get five free travel packs.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.240
 So once again, it's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:43.240 --> 03:45.760
 to get Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2,

03:45.760 --> 03:49.460
 that's a year supply plus the five free travel packs.

03:49.460 --> 03:52.800
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Monk Pack.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.480
 Monk Pack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks

03:55.480 --> 03:56.860
 that taste incredible,

03:56.860 --> 03:59.160
 but have just one gram of sugar or less.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.080
 And indeed, they taste incredible.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.740
 In fact, my production team here

04:02.740 --> 04:04.400
 at the Huberman Lab Podcast teases me

04:04.400 --> 04:06.360
 because I actually have to keep the boxes

04:06.360 --> 04:08.200
 of Monk Pack bars in my basement,

04:08.200 --> 04:10.360
 because otherwise I'll tear through all of them.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.200
 I remember the first time I tasted it,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.260
 I was like, all right, here we go, a keto bar.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.040
 I'm not a big fan of bars in general.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.400
 Most of them don't taste good to me.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.160
 And I tasted the Monk Pack bars

04:18.160 --> 04:20.020
 and they are absolutely awesome.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.760
 They come in a lot of different flavors.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.880
 I'm partial to the caramel sea salt one,

04:23.880 --> 04:26.440
 but they also have sea salt dark chocolate,

04:26.440 --> 04:27.560
 peanut butter dark chocolate.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.860
 They have a bunch of flavors.

04:28.860 --> 04:29.760
 They're all incredible.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.080
 I've tried them all, which is why I keep them in my basement.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.480
 As I've mentioned previously on this podcast,

04:35.480 --> 04:37.560
 I'm neither keto nor carbo.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.080
 I don't really follow a particular diet in that sense.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.720
 I eat in a way that maximizes my alertness

04:42.720 --> 04:45.520
 and my levels of focus during the day when I want to work,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.620
 and that maximize my transition to sleep at night.

04:48.620 --> 04:52.440
 So I basically eat low carb keto-ish during the day.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.040
 And I know the ketonistas will say that I'm not in ketosis

04:55.040 --> 04:56.900
 and I can manage to get into ketosis.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.440
 But the main idea is I keep my carbohydrates low

04:59.440 --> 05:00.280
 during the day.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.320
 And then at night I do eat carbohydrates.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.820
 So for me, the Monk Pack bars are a really good snack,

05:04.820 --> 05:07.320
 usually in the afternoon, maybe with a cup of coffee,

05:07.320 --> 05:09.480
 especially if I'm going to train soon after that,

05:09.480 --> 05:12.320
 or if I just want a snack and I'm going to continue working.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.240
 As I mentioned before, they're absolutely delicious.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.000
 They also don't have any of the stuff that's bad for you.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.500
 No soy, trans fat, sugar alcohols, artificial colors,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.920
 all that stuff that we know we should avoid.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.420
 If you want to try Monk Pack bars,

05:24.420 --> 05:28.720

05:38.160 --> 05:39.880
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout

05:39.880 --> 05:42.360
 to get 20% off your purchase.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.180
 This month, we're talking all about hormones.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.240
 Hormones are incredible,

05:46.240 --> 05:49.640
 and they control so many processes in the brain and body.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.240
 Last episode, we talked about the role

05:51.240 --> 05:53.400
 of estrogen and testosterone.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.280
 Today, we're going to talk about how hormones

05:55.280 --> 05:59.080
 impact feeding and hunger, as well as satiety,

05:59.080 --> 06:00.600
 the feeling that you don't want to eat

06:00.600 --> 06:02.760
 or that you've eaten enough.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.040
 Now, it's important to understand

06:04.040 --> 06:06.680
 that hormones don't work alone in this context.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.520
 Today, I'm going to describe some hormones

06:08.520 --> 06:10.760
 that have powerful effects on whether or not

06:10.760 --> 06:14.780
 you want to eat more or less or stop eating altogether,

06:14.780 --> 06:16.800
 but they don't do that on their own.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.800
 They do that in cooperation with the nervous system.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.080
 So today, I would say as much,

06:22.080 --> 06:24.680
 or perhaps even more than any other episodes,

06:24.680 --> 06:26.760
 we're going to hear a lot of biology,

06:26.760 --> 06:29.480
 but there are multiple what I'm going to call entry points

06:29.480 --> 06:31.680
 for tools that you can apply

06:31.680 --> 06:33.720
 in order to regulate your levels of hunger,

06:33.720 --> 06:36.560
 your meal timing, your levels of satiety,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.400
 of not wanting to eat more,

06:38.400 --> 06:41.360
 and many of this is actionable with behaviors,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.380
 but of course, we're also going to talk about supplements,

06:43.380 --> 06:44.720
 and we're actually going to talk about

06:44.720 --> 06:46.600
 a little bit of brain machine interface,

06:46.600 --> 06:48.520
 devices that can actually be involved

06:48.520 --> 06:50.520
 in manipulating these incredible things

06:50.520 --> 06:54.220
 that we think of as hunger and appetite and satiety.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.120
 So the first thing that you need to know

06:56.120 --> 06:57.820
 about the nervous system side,

06:57.820 --> 07:00.200
 the neural control over feeding and hunger,

07:00.200 --> 07:01.660
 is that there's an area of your brain

07:01.660 --> 07:03.240
 called the hypothalamus.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.280
 It's in the forebrain,

07:04.280 --> 07:06.040
 which tells you it's in the front of your brain,

07:06.040 --> 07:08.660
 and it's at the base of the forebrain.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.360
 Now, the hypothalamus contains

07:10.360 --> 07:11.880
 lots of different kinds of neurons

07:11.880 --> 07:13.820
 doing lots of different kinds of things.

07:13.820 --> 07:15.200
 There are neurons in your hypothalamus

07:15.200 --> 07:17.180
 controlling sexual behavior,

07:17.180 --> 07:18.600
 controlling body temperature,

07:18.600 --> 07:20.160
 controlling circadian rhythms,

07:20.160 --> 07:21.800
 the desire to sleep or be awake,

07:21.800 --> 07:23.920
 even neurons controlling rage.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.080
 There are actually neurons that if we were to stimulate them

07:27.080 --> 07:29.560
 would send you or anyone into a rage.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.600
 They're just powerful control centers

07:31.600 --> 07:32.800
 for the brain and body.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.120
 There's a particular area of the hypothalamus

07:36.120 --> 07:39.040
 called the ventromedial hypothalamus.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.480
 And it's one that researchers have been interested

07:41.480 --> 07:44.440
 for a long time now in terms of its relationship

07:44.440 --> 07:45.880
 to hunger and feeding.

07:45.880 --> 07:50.480
 And the reason is it creates these paradoxical effects.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.380
 What do I mean by that?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.960
 What they found was that sometimes lesioning

07:53.960 --> 07:56.840
 or disrupting the neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus

07:56.840 --> 07:59.200
 would make animals or people hyperphagic.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.500
 They would want to eat like crazy.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.700
 And other lesions in other individuals or animals

08:05.700 --> 08:07.000
 would make them anorexic,

08:07.000 --> 08:08.780
 would make them not want to eat at all.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.440
 It would make food aversive.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.920
 So that means that the ventromedial hypothalamus

08:12.920 --> 08:14.960
 is definitely an interesting control station

08:14.960 --> 08:16.880
 for hunger and feeding and satiety,

08:16.880 --> 08:18.920
 but it doesn't really tell you what's going on

08:18.920 --> 08:19.980
 at a deeper level.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.840
 In fact, it's a little bit confusing or paradoxical.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.760
 It turns out that there are multiple populations

08:24.760 --> 08:25.600
 of neurons in there.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
 We're going to talk about those.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.240
 Some are promoting feeding

08:28.240 --> 08:32.080
 and some are promoting not feeding or not eating.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.560
 Now, the other neural component of all this

08:34.560 --> 08:36.120
 that you need to know about

08:36.120 --> 08:37.980
 actually has to do with your mouth.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.280
 So there's an area of your cortex.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.920
 So that's a little bit further up in your brain

08:41.920 --> 08:43.560
 called the insular cortex.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.960
 And it processes a lot of different kinds of information,

08:45.960 --> 08:48.400
 mostly information about what's going on inside you,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.420
 so-called interoception.

08:50.420 --> 08:54.000
 The insular cortex has neurons that get input

08:54.000 --> 08:57.560
 from your mouth, from the touch receptors in your mouth.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.860
 An insular cortex has powerful control

08:59.860 --> 09:02.520
 over whether or not you're enjoying what you're eating,

09:02.520 --> 09:04.860
 whether or not you want to avoid what you're eating,

09:04.860 --> 09:06.200
 whether or not you've had enough

09:06.200 --> 09:09.020
 or whether or not you want to continue eating more.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.880
 And that has to do, believe it or not,

09:10.880 --> 09:13.460
 with the touch or sensation of eating.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.520
 I'm very familiar with this.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.940
 I'm one of these people I love eating so much

09:16.940 --> 09:19.720
 that I just like the mere act of chewing.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.720
 I like celery sticks enough.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.000
 I'm not crazy about them, but they taste fine to me

09:24.000 --> 09:25.060
 and I like chewing on celery sticks,

09:25.060 --> 09:27.560
 but I actually just like chewing on them.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.680
 I could eat all day long,

09:29.680 --> 09:32.060
 except that it's not healthy to do that.

09:32.060 --> 09:35.220
 But the mere act of chewing for me is very pleasurable.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.820
 People who chew gum feel this way as well.

09:37.820 --> 09:40.140
 And just as a point about gum or chewing,

09:40.140 --> 09:43.700
 if you chew something like celery or cucumber slices

09:43.700 --> 09:46.680
 or chew gum, provided it doesn't have any sugar

09:46.680 --> 09:48.240
 or caloric content,

09:48.240 --> 09:50.960
 it's not going to drive increased hunger.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.780
 That generally isn't the case.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.440
 But if you eat something with sugar,

09:54.440 --> 09:55.280
 as we'll find out,

09:55.280 --> 09:58.240
 it has a very specific action in the insular cortex

09:58.240 --> 09:59.640
 and in other areas of your nervous system

09:59.640 --> 10:01.720
 that promotes the desire to eat more.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.360
 But the key point right now is to know

10:03.360 --> 10:04.400
 you've got these two brain areas,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.080
 the ventromedial hypothalamus,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.420
 that's involved in hunger and lack of hunger,

10:09.420 --> 10:11.940
 sort of an accelerator and a brake on feeding.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.640
 And you have this insular cortex

10:13.640 --> 10:15.040
 that gets input from your mouth

10:15.040 --> 10:18.240
 and cares about chewing and the consistency of foods

10:18.240 --> 10:19.660
 and all sorts of interesting things

10:19.660 --> 10:21.120
 that are just very tactile.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.200
 And I think most people think about the touch receptors on,

10:23.200 --> 10:25.300
 excuse me, the taste receptors on the tongue,

10:25.300 --> 10:26.900
 but we often don't think about

10:26.900 --> 10:30.240
 the touch or tactile essence of food.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.840
 The thing that comes to mind just now

10:31.840 --> 10:33.720
 is I've gone to sushi several times

10:33.720 --> 10:35.600
 and some people really like the urchin.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.120
 I don't like the urchin, there's something about it

10:37.120 --> 10:38.880
 that kind of creeps me out about the consistency.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.000
 Other people love it.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.320
 So it's highly individual and it's probably learned

10:42.320 --> 10:44.780
 and there's some probably cultural background to this

10:44.780 --> 10:46.440
 if you were raised eating urchin.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.440
 Some people love that consistency or that touch.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.680
 So touch has a lot to do

10:51.680 --> 10:53.800
 with whether or not you want to eat or not.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.540
 Now let's get back to the ventromedial hypothalamus.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.280
 Sometimes it makes animals or people want to eat more,

10:59.280 --> 11:00.120
 sometimes less.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.320
 So what's going on there?

11:01.320 --> 11:03.640
 There's a classic experiment that was done

11:03.640 --> 11:06.200
 in which researchers took two rats

11:06.200 --> 11:08.760
 and so-called parabios to them to each other.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.560
 What that meant is that they did a little surgery

11:10.560 --> 11:12.380
 and they linked their blood supply

11:12.380 --> 11:15.120
 so that they were forever physically linked to one another

11:15.120 --> 11:17.620
 and could exchange factors in the blood,

11:17.620 --> 11:18.720
 but their brains were separate,

11:18.720 --> 11:19.680
 their mouths were separate,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.960
 and they essentially did everything separately

11:21.960 --> 11:23.280
 except that they were linked to one another.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.100
 So they had to walk together and go to the same places

11:25.100 --> 11:26.000
 in order to do it.

11:27.660 --> 11:29.680
 This parabiosis experiment

11:29.680 --> 11:31.720
 revealed something really important.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.860
 When they lesioned the ventromedial hypothalamus

11:33.860 --> 11:37.160
 in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat,

11:37.160 --> 11:39.920
 that rat got very, very fat.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.340
 It's just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.

11:43.340 --> 11:46.360
 The other one, however, got very thin.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.920
 It actually lost weight

11:47.920 --> 11:50.680
 despite consuming the same amount of food that it had

11:50.680 --> 11:53.080
 prior to the other one getting the lesion.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.080
 So what does this tell us?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.540
 This tells us that there's something in the blood

11:56.540 --> 11:59.080
 that's being exchanged between the two animals

11:59.080 --> 12:01.720
 because it was their blood supply that was linked,

12:01.720 --> 12:05.420
 and that tells us that there's hormone or endocrine signals

12:05.420 --> 12:07.640
 that are involved in the desire to eat

12:07.640 --> 12:09.280
 and hunger and appetite.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.560
 And so next, we're going to talk about

12:10.560 --> 12:12.520
 what those endocrine signals are,

12:12.520 --> 12:14.560
 and then I'm going to immediately point

12:14.560 --> 12:16.640
 to some entry points that you can use,

12:16.640 --> 12:18.200
 and you can use these

12:18.200 --> 12:20.780
 even if you're not parabiosed to anything,

12:20.780 --> 12:24.840
 and that can allow you to time your meal frequency

12:24.840 --> 12:27.580
 and predict when you're going to be hungry or not,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.200
 as well as drive up appetite.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.520
 Believe it or not, there are people out there

12:30.520 --> 12:32.320
 who are trying to eat more,

12:32.320 --> 12:35.300
 although I think far many more people are trying to eat less

12:35.300 --> 12:38.440
 because nowadays, the data just point to the fact

12:38.440 --> 12:41.520
 that there is essentially an epidemic of diabetes,

12:41.520 --> 12:43.440
 type 2 diabetes, and obesity.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.080
 And most everyone agrees now

12:46.080 --> 12:48.280
 that maintaining a healthy body weight

12:48.280 --> 12:49.680
 and body weight composition

12:49.680 --> 12:51.760
 is one of the best paths to longevity

12:51.760 --> 12:53.120
 and to just feeling very good

12:53.120 --> 12:54.360
 and actually being able to think.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.680
 Cognitive functioning is actually linked

12:56.680 --> 13:00.820
 to levels of adipose tissue and so forth.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.000
 So let's talk about the endocrine factors

13:03.000 --> 13:05.840
 that regulate feeding, hunger, and satiety.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.160
 One of the really exciting things to emerge

13:08.160 --> 13:12.600
 in the science of feeding and appetite in the last 20 years

13:12.600 --> 13:14.580
 is the discovery of another brain area,

13:14.580 --> 13:16.560
 not just the ventromedial hypothalamus,

13:16.560 --> 13:19.760
 but it's an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.880
 And the arcuate nucleus

13:21.880 --> 13:24.840
 has some really fascinating sets of neurons

13:24.840 --> 13:28.340
 that release even more incredible molecules

13:28.340 --> 13:30.400
 and chemicals into the blood.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.640
 And these chemicals act as accelerators

13:32.640 --> 13:35.080
 on feeding and appetite or breaks.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.320
 And the really cool thing

13:36.320 --> 13:39.280
 is that you can actually control these molecules

13:39.280 --> 13:40.480
 through simple behaviors.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.240
 And once you understand what these molecules are,

13:43.240 --> 13:45.480
 you'll start to understand why that's the case

13:45.480 --> 13:48.180
 and the control points that you have right now

13:48.180 --> 13:50.960
 in order to control your appetite in either direction,

13:50.960 --> 13:52.940
 increase or decrease.

13:52.940 --> 13:55.040
 So first of all, there are a set of neurons

13:55.040 --> 13:58.920
 in this arcuate nucleus called the PMOC neurons, okay?

13:58.920 --> 14:01.540
 I don't want to get into what the acronym stands for,

14:01.540 --> 14:03.000
 but I'll do it anyway.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.880
 It's the pro-opiomelanocortin system, okay?

14:06.880 --> 14:10.900
 So these are PMOC neurons, pro-opiomelanocortin.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.440
 And if you heard melano,

14:12.440 --> 14:15.780
 that should tell you it has something to do with pigmentation

14:15.780 --> 14:17.720
 in skin cells or in hair cells,

14:17.720 --> 14:20.800
 pigmentation of some sort because of melanin.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.520
 Last episode, I talked a little bit

14:22.520 --> 14:26.000
 about the relationship between light, dopamine, and melanin.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.520
 So you should already be thinking, wait,

14:27.520 --> 14:30.440
 melano means it probably has something to do

14:30.440 --> 14:33.180
 with that system, and indeed it does.

14:33.180 --> 14:37.180
 Now, the POMC neurons make something called alpha-MSH,

14:39.620 --> 14:42.000
 melanocyte stimulating hormone.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.120
 Alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.080
 If you don't want to remember any of the other acronyms

14:47.080 --> 14:50.880
 and terms I've talked about this episode so far,

14:50.880 --> 14:53.800
 do try and remember MSH, okay?

14:53.800 --> 14:57.360
 Mouse, Sam, hamster, MSH, okay?

14:57.360 --> 15:00.400
 MSH reduces appetite.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.760
 And it's a powerful molecule, all right?

15:02.760 --> 15:06.920
 So just put that on the shelf, MSH reduces appetite.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.880
 Now there's another population of neurons

15:08.880 --> 15:11.760
 in the arcuate nucleus called the AGRP neurons.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.660
 And there, I'm truly not going to read you

15:13.660 --> 15:15.280
 what that stands for because it's related

15:15.280 --> 15:17.380
 to the mouse strain it was first identified in,

15:17.380 --> 15:22.380
 but humans have these cells as well, but AGRP neurons.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.980
 The AGRP neurons stimulate eating.

15:26.980 --> 15:29.760
 And anytime you are approaching food

15:29.760 --> 15:32.820
 or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety,

15:32.820 --> 15:34.700
 because some people actually experience

15:34.700 --> 15:36.160
 a kind of heightened anxiety,

15:36.160 --> 15:38.760
 some people actually get a little bit of a resting tremor

15:38.760 --> 15:40.160
 before they eat, even if they don't have

15:40.160 --> 15:41.520
 any sort of eating disorder,

15:41.520 --> 15:44.660
 there's kind of a ramping up of autonomic activity.

15:44.660 --> 15:48.720
 That's largely due to the activity of these AGRP neurons.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.600
 So the activity in these AGRP neurons goes way up

15:53.600 --> 15:57.000
 when animals or people are starved.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.680
 And I don't mean starve for long periods of time,

15:58.680 --> 16:01.120
 but I mean, when they haven't eaten for a while.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.120
 And the activity of MSH,

16:04.120 --> 16:07.400
 the release of MSH goes up when we've eaten.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.000
 However, there are other things that will stimulate

16:10.000 --> 16:13.160
 the release of things like MSH.

16:13.160 --> 16:17.440
 So just briefly, the experimental evidence.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.600
 If you kill AGRP neurons, animals and people stop eating.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.200
 There are people who have lesions, they just stop eating.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.480
 They become anorexic.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.720
 That's actually, I know you're familiar with anorexia

16:25.720 --> 16:27.960
 as a clinical term, but that's actually a term

16:27.960 --> 16:29.940
 that's used in the scientific literature

16:29.940 --> 16:32.680
 about a pattern of behavior, okay?

16:32.680 --> 16:34.280
 As well as a clinical term, of course.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.740
 If you were to stimulate the AGRP neurons,

16:37.860 --> 16:39.920
 animals or people eat like crazy.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.860
 They will eat to the point where they burst,

16:41.860 --> 16:43.660
 which just sounds horrible, but it just tells you

16:43.660 --> 16:45.720
 this is the accelerator on eating.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.200
 And yes, as relationship to the ventromedial hypothalamus

16:48.200 --> 16:49.020
 I talked about earlier,

16:49.020 --> 16:51.160
 but I don't want to go back there just yet.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.640
 We will circle back.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.600
 So melanocyte stimulating hormone,

16:55.600 --> 16:57.400
 such an interesting hormone.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.440
 This thing can shut down the desire to eat.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.380
 The melanocyte stimulating hormone

17:05.040 --> 17:07.160
 is released from the medial pituitary.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.740
 We talked about the pituitary last time.

17:08.740 --> 17:12.440
 This is a gland that is very closely positioned

17:12.440 --> 17:13.400
 to the hypothalamus.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.960
 Actually, some of the hypothalamus neurons

17:14.960 --> 17:17.560
 actually project their neural connections

17:17.560 --> 17:20.160
 directly into the pituitary to release things

17:20.160 --> 17:22.680
 like gonadotropins and luteinizing hormone,

17:22.680 --> 17:23.780
 stuff we talked about last time

17:23.780 --> 17:26.560
 in reference to testosterone and estrogen.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.300
 But MSH is released from the medial portion

17:30.300 --> 17:34.440
 of the pituitary, and it stimulates the desire

17:34.440 --> 17:36.580
 to not eat, to cease eating.

17:36.580 --> 17:40.280
 What's really interesting is that melanocyte

17:40.280 --> 17:45.100
 stimulating hormone is activated by ultraviolet light.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.340
 And it's not activated by ultraviolet light to the skin

17:48.340 --> 17:49.900
 or directly to the pituitary.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.900
 It's activated by ultraviolet light to the eyes.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.240
 Now, if you've been watching this podcast

17:56.240 --> 17:58.160
 or listening to this podcast for any period of time,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.820
 or you've heard me on other podcasts,

17:59.820 --> 18:01.660
 or you follow my Instagram,

18:01.660 --> 18:04.180
 I am a big fan of this whole thing of getting morning light

18:04.180 --> 18:06.400
 in order to synchronize circadian rhythms, et cetera,

18:06.400 --> 18:09.000
 avoiding light in the middle of the night.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.600
 This is yet another reason why getting ample light,

18:13.600 --> 18:16.720
 ideally sunlight, but it could be other sources of UV light

18:16.720 --> 18:19.200
 to the eyes, stimulates MSH,

18:19.200 --> 18:21.680
 this has been shown over and over again,

18:21.680 --> 18:25.680
 and keeps the desire to eat or appetite in check

18:25.680 --> 18:27.280
 in healthy ranges.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.660
 This is also why in the spring and summer months,

18:30.660 --> 18:33.300
 animals and people eat less.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.000
 Now, for hibernating animals, it's different

18:35.000 --> 18:37.020
 because the bear hibernating,

18:37.020 --> 18:39.460
 actually bears don't truly hibernate technically

18:39.460 --> 18:41.820
 by scientific criteria, they don't hibernate,

18:41.820 --> 18:43.560
 but they go into a kind of torpor.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.520
 The hibernating animals, they don't eat much

18:46.520 --> 18:48.540
 because they're in burrows or dens

18:48.540 --> 18:50.120
 or they're just wrapped up in a little ball

18:50.120 --> 18:51.720
 or whatever it is that hibernating animals do.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.480
 So they're of course going to eat far less in the winter,

18:53.480 --> 18:54.600
 but that's a unique scenario.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.880
 We are not hibernating animals,

18:55.880 --> 18:59.480
 but humans generally have greater appetite

18:59.480 --> 19:01.300
 in the cold winter months.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.660
 It's not just because of the holidays

19:02.660 --> 19:05.120
 and the abundance of food that we're presenting ourselves

19:05.120 --> 19:07.760
 with, but when we get a lot of sun,

19:07.760 --> 19:12.240
 our appetite is reduced or at least it's easier to control.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.680
 And that is due in part,

19:14.680 --> 19:17.800
 because if you're getting ample sunlight to the eyes,

19:17.800 --> 19:21.440
 it's converted into a signal for the MSH neurons,

19:22.440 --> 19:24.360
 the neurons that release MSH, excuse me,

19:24.360 --> 19:26.320
 these POMC neurons release MSH,

19:26.320 --> 19:29.560
 and then MSH can bind its receptors

19:29.560 --> 19:34.280
 and can keep the brake on appetite in check.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.000
 So the takeaway tool from this

19:36.000 --> 19:38.360
 is make sure you're getting enough light,

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
 not just in the morning, but throughout the day.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.160
 And yes, it has to be light to your eyes

19:42.160 --> 19:44.520
 and blasting your eyes with sunlight or artificial light

19:44.520 --> 19:46.220
 to the point where it's damaging or painful

19:46.220 --> 19:48.200
 won't accelerate or improve this process.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.700
 It's about getting photons, ultraviolet light to the eyes

19:51.700 --> 19:53.560
 consistently throughout the day.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.720
 That's best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses

19:56.720 --> 19:59.000
 provided you can do that safely.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.160
 And if you don't have access to enough sunlight,

20:01.160 --> 20:03.520
 then you can do this with artificial light.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.880
 This also points again to our old friends, the blue blockers.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.840
 Many people know I'm not a huge fan of blue blockers,

20:09.840 --> 20:11.600
 especially not during the daytime

20:11.600 --> 20:13.720
 because they block a lot of the UV

20:13.720 --> 20:15.900
 and shorter wavelength light that you want

20:15.900 --> 20:17.600
 and need to create alertness,

20:17.600 --> 20:22.600
 but also to create release of MSH from the medial pituitary.

20:23.400 --> 20:28.320
 Now, there are people out there, subcultures,

20:28.320 --> 20:31.360
 that actually inject MSH,

20:31.360 --> 20:34.480
 that are taking MSH or things similar to it.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.640
 I am not suggesting people do that,

20:36.640 --> 20:40.240
 but there are three main consequences of doing that.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.960
 First of all, it reduces appetite, no surprise there.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.280
 They're actually using it as a dieting drug.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.000
 This is kind of in the underground.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.400
 I don't know what the legal status is.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.200
 And again, I'm not promoting that people do it.

20:50.200 --> 20:55.200
 Two, it makes them very, very tan, which makes sense, right?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.800
 Melanocyte stimulating hormone.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.780
 And the third is it purportedly, never tried it,

21:01.780 --> 21:04.820
 purportedly sends libido through the roof

21:04.820 --> 21:06.540
 to the point where it's actually distracting

21:06.540 --> 21:08.240
 for other activities.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.220
 It actually can create priapism,

21:10.220 --> 21:13.360
 which is a kind of chronic erection in males

21:13.360 --> 21:15.800
 to the point where it actually can be physically damaging

21:15.800 --> 21:16.960
 to the genitalia.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.120
 So this is a drug of,

21:19.120 --> 21:20.920
 or I don't know whether or not to call it a drug.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.960
 It's a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels,

21:24.960 --> 21:28.560
 with sunlight and perhaps artificial UV light.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.500
 I have not heard much about treatments for obesity

21:32.500 --> 21:35.900
 involving getting ample sunlight or getting ample UV light,

21:35.900 --> 21:38.720
 but to me, the logic is just very clear.

21:38.720 --> 21:42.040
 And so if you're pursuing those avenues,

21:42.040 --> 21:44.040
 you certainly should talk to your physician,

21:44.040 --> 21:45.120
 but you might want to think about

21:45.120 --> 21:46.960
 how some of those logic hangs together.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.300
 Absolutely fascinating hormone.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.320
 I think most people aren't aware of it.

21:50.320 --> 21:53.360
 And the subcultures that are aware of it

21:53.360 --> 21:55.900
 are using it to very particular endpoints,

21:55.900 --> 21:59.120
 and they're using it at super physiological levels.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.720
 That's enough about that, because I really don't know.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.920
 I've talked to a few people in research,

22:03.920 --> 22:05.000
 believe it or not, for this podcast.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.400
 I reached out to a few people and asked whether or not

22:07.400 --> 22:10.280
 these side effects, in air quotes,

22:10.280 --> 22:12.080
 that I've heard about are true, and indeed they're true.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.080
 But again, that's super physiological.

22:14.080 --> 22:18.260
 Controlling MSH, it's actually alpha MSH levels

22:18.260 --> 22:22.720
 through viewing ultraviolet light seems like an interesting

22:22.720 --> 22:25.800
 and mechanistically logical thing to do

22:25.800 --> 22:29.000
 if your goal is to keep appetite in check.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.520
 So MSH inhibits hunger.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.760
 Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide

22:33.760 --> 22:35.920
 that activates hunger.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.980
 And this is a really interesting one,

22:37.980 --> 22:40.880
 because it relates to when you get hungry,

22:40.880 --> 22:43.800
 in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.060
 And it's called ghrelin.

22:45.060 --> 22:49.600
 It's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.580
 Ghrelin is released actually from the GI tract.

22:53.580 --> 22:58.520
 And its main role is to increase your desire to eat.

22:58.520 --> 23:02.000
 And it does that through a variety of mechanisms.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.800
 Part of that is to stimulate some of the brain areas,

23:04.800 --> 23:08.040
 the actual neurons that make you want to eat.

23:08.040 --> 23:11.000
 In addition, it creates food anticipatory signals

23:11.000 --> 23:11.960
 within your nervous system.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.440
 So you start thinking about the things

23:13.440 --> 23:15.380
 that you happen to like to eat

23:15.380 --> 23:17.760
 at that particular time of day.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.800
 This is fascinating.

23:18.800 --> 23:23.040
 Ghrelin is sort of like a clock, a hormonal clock

23:23.040 --> 23:25.360
 that makes you want to eat at particular times.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.740
 Now, the signal for ghrelin

23:26.740 --> 23:30.120
 is reduced glucose levels in the blood.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.800
 We're going to talk a lot today about glucose and insulin,

23:33.800 --> 23:36.280
 ways to manage glucose and insulin.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.680
 But for now, the simple version of this

23:38.680 --> 23:40.840
 is you normally want your glucose

23:40.840 --> 23:43.640
 to be in a kind of modest range.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.880
 And I'll explain what that range is in a little bit.

23:46.880 --> 23:51.400
 But if it drops too low, ghrelin is secreted from your gut.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.880
 It activates neurons in your brain at various locations,

23:54.880 --> 23:58.200
 including the PMOC neurons

23:58.200 --> 24:00.800
 and the other neurons of the arcuate.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.920
 It also activates the VMH in particular ways.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.640
 And it might even activate some of these neurons

24:06.640 --> 24:08.440
 that are in the periphery in your mouth

24:08.440 --> 24:10.160
 that actually make you kind of salivate

24:10.160 --> 24:11.920
 and want to eat, right?

24:11.920 --> 24:14.860
 We all know about the famous Pavlovian experiments

24:14.860 --> 24:17.320
 the Pavlov's dogs, they start salivating to the bell

24:17.320 --> 24:19.240
 after the bell was presented with food, you remove the food

24:19.240 --> 24:21.960
 and then just the bell can stimulate the salivation.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.780
 We become Pavlovian at times,

24:23.780 --> 24:25.640
 but rarely has it ever discussed

24:25.640 --> 24:27.780
 what the neural pathways for that are.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.600
 And it turns out that these hormones

24:29.600 --> 24:31.080
 that are secreted from the gut

24:31.080 --> 24:34.480
 can stimulate the neurons to create a sensation

24:34.480 --> 24:37.680
 and a desire for certain foods at certain times of day.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.880
 You've done this experiment.

24:40.880 --> 24:45.140
 If you are somebody who eats breakfast at more or less

24:45.140 --> 24:46.180
 the same time each day,

24:46.180 --> 24:48.960
 let's say 8 AM plus or minus 20 minutes,

24:48.960 --> 24:52.720
 and then you eat lunch 1230 plus or minus 20 minutes,

24:52.720 --> 24:54.060
 or let's say you're somebody like me

24:54.060 --> 24:57.320
 who typically skips breakfast and just eats lunch

24:57.320 --> 25:00.100
 usually around 1130 or 12 or something like that,

25:01.180 --> 25:04.280
 your ghrelin secretion will start to match

25:04.280 --> 25:06.480
 when you typically eat.

25:06.480 --> 25:09.160
 And it does that and it's able to override

25:09.160 --> 25:11.620
 the low levels of glucose in your bloodstream

25:11.620 --> 25:15.080
 because the ghrelin system also gets input

25:15.080 --> 25:18.300
 from a clock in your liver

25:18.300 --> 25:21.120
 that is linked to the clock in your hypothalamus

25:21.120 --> 25:21.960
 in your brain.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.280
 And what this means is if you eat at regular meal times,

25:24.280 --> 25:25.840
 you will start to get hungry a few minutes

25:25.840 --> 25:26.920
 before those meals times.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.600
 If you've ever wondered why

25:28.600 --> 25:30.760
 your stomach kind of starts to growl

25:30.760 --> 25:32.880
 because it's a particular time of day,

25:32.880 --> 25:34.500
 you're like, oh, I must want to eat.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.000
 Well, that's ghrelin.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.680
 And for those of you that don't know

25:37.680 --> 25:38.940
 why your stomach growls,

25:38.940 --> 25:40.400
 I'll also tell you that today.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.000
 It's actually really interesting.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
 It's not at all what you expect.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.660
 And it's not just the gurgling of liquids in your stomach.

25:46.660 --> 25:47.860
 That's not what it is.

25:47.860 --> 25:50.760
 It's actually a muscular phenomenon.

25:50.760 --> 25:55.240
 So ghrelin is secreted as a kind of food anticipatory signal

25:55.240 --> 25:58.520
 to get you motivated to go eat at regular times.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.440
 So nowadays there's a lot of interest

26:00.440 --> 26:01.960
 in intermittent fasting.

26:02.820 --> 26:06.120
 There's also a lot of interest in just what meal plans

26:06.120 --> 26:08.320
 and schedules and what to eat in general

26:08.320 --> 26:11.720
 in order to maximize one's health and wellbeing.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.940
 And people have all sorts of cosmetic reasons

26:13.940 --> 26:16.220
 and brain reasons and metabolic reasons

26:16.220 --> 26:18.540
 for wanting to control this kind of stuff.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.120
 So let's make it really simple

26:20.120 --> 26:22.300
 by first looking at the extremes.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.040
 Some people need to eat every two or three hours.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.280
 They feel this, I need to eat every two or three hours

26:27.280 --> 26:29.500
 or else their blood sugar drops.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.320
 In general, blood sugar doesn't drop so low

26:33.320 --> 26:34.820
 that they truly need to eat

26:34.820 --> 26:37.560
 in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.760
 Although sometimes that can happen.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.440
 Some people are truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.920
 But most people, as the blood sugar starts to head down

26:45.920 --> 26:49.560
 towards the low-ish ranges, ghrelin is secreted.

26:49.560 --> 26:53.520
 And so for those people, not eating on the clock

26:53.520 --> 26:54.900
 is very disruptive to them

26:54.900 --> 26:57.480
 because it activates these neurons in the brain.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.260
 For people who eat once a day or twice a day

27:00.260 --> 27:03.200
 or tend to shift their meals, they might eat a lot,

27:03.200 --> 27:05.960
 but during a limited so-called feeding window,

27:05.960 --> 27:08.540
 it's kind of interesting, humans now eat

27:08.540 --> 27:10.560
 and talk about foods in ways that for years

27:10.560 --> 27:13.040
 I used to hear about in classes and courses

27:13.040 --> 27:15.240
 and research lectures about feeding animals,

27:15.240 --> 27:16.640
 restricted feeding windows.

27:16.640 --> 27:21.600
 And we owe a great deal of gratitude to Sachin Panda,

27:21.600 --> 27:23.920
 who was a colleague of mine when my lab was in San Diego

27:23.920 --> 27:27.840
 at the Salk Institute, who really is one of the pioneers

27:27.840 --> 27:30.520
 of this restricted feeding window work

27:30.520 --> 27:31.680
 and has done a beautiful work.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.540
 He has a book that's excellent called the Circadian Code

27:34.540 --> 27:35.720
 that I highly recommend.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.260
 And he's done a lot of important work on neurons

27:38.260 --> 27:40.360
 in the retina that control circadian timing,

27:40.360 --> 27:41.480
 but also the relationship

27:41.480 --> 27:44.240
 between feeding windows and health.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.360
 And he's sort of the major proponent out there,

27:48.360 --> 27:50.820
 among the major proponents, I should say, of circadian eating

27:50.820 --> 27:52.920
 that means eating during the daytime, not at night,

27:52.920 --> 27:55.280
 or intermittent fasting, restricting feeding windows

27:55.280 --> 27:58.520
 to anywhere from four to six to eight hours.

27:58.520 --> 28:01.540
 I'll use myself as an example of the transition

28:01.540 --> 28:06.440
 from regular feeding schedule to more intermittent-ish

28:06.440 --> 28:08.340
 fasting, although I don't really fall

28:08.340 --> 28:10.160
 into true intermittent fasting.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.240
 So I was one of these people that just got so accustomed

28:12.240 --> 28:16.280
 to waking up and eating about an hour after I woke up

28:16.280 --> 28:19.480
 that to go from eating every three or four hours

28:19.480 --> 28:21.920
 to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner,

28:21.920 --> 28:23.800
 maybe a couple of snacks in the afternoon or something,

28:23.800 --> 28:25.620
 at first was excruciating.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.600
 I remember thinking like,

28:26.600 --> 28:28.800
 this is really brutal, pushing out, feeding.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.580
 I didn't think I could exercise unless I had eaten first.

28:31.580 --> 28:35.440
 We now know that during most all forms of exercise,

28:35.440 --> 28:38.280
 unless you're really focused on optimal performance,

28:38.280 --> 28:39.720
 like you've got to hit key lifts

28:39.720 --> 28:42.920
 or you have to sprint at your maximum speed,

28:42.920 --> 28:46.040
 and maybe even then, that you can exercise faster just fine

28:46.040 --> 28:48.400
 because you're mainly relying on sources

28:48.400 --> 28:50.360
 like glycogen from the liver,

28:50.360 --> 28:52.140
 some undigested food sometimes,

28:52.140 --> 28:53.840
 as gross as that might seem, it's true,

28:53.840 --> 28:58.560
 as well as body fat if the exercise bout is extremely long.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.360
 But what that means is that if you suddenly go from eating

29:02.360 --> 29:04.960
 on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal

29:04.960 --> 29:08.560
 or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all,

29:08.560 --> 29:10.080
 you're going to have ghrelin in your system.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.660
 And that ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat

29:12.660 --> 29:14.400
 by acting at the level of your brain.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.140
 And it is indeed at that point, just mental.

29:17.140 --> 29:18.680
 When we hear about just mental, just physical,

29:18.680 --> 29:19.760
 it's really kind of the same thing

29:19.760 --> 29:21.640
 because it's all chemicals, brain and body,

29:21.640 --> 29:24.260
 but it's the stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.660
 You're stimulating the arcuate nucleus neurons

29:26.660 --> 29:29.260
 that make you want to eat those AGRP neurons.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.920
 So ghrelin stimulates the AGRP neurons,

29:31.920 --> 29:33.560
 which makes you want to eat.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.600
 So what can you do with this?

29:34.600 --> 29:37.760
 What this means is if you want to start shifting

29:37.760 --> 29:40.380
 your feeding schedule to one where you're not eating

29:40.380 --> 29:43.120
 quite as frequently, and there are some advantages to that

29:43.120 --> 29:46.560
 that aren't just in the biochemistry and health related,

29:46.560 --> 29:48.620
 cellular health related things,

29:48.620 --> 29:51.160
 but some of them include not having to think about

29:51.160 --> 29:52.820
 or buy food, right?

29:52.820 --> 29:54.800
 You actually don't have to think about food all day

29:54.800 --> 29:56.440
 if you're not eating so often.

29:56.440 --> 30:00.400
 The other is it gives you a far more social flexibility.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.720
 You can go to a noon meeting if you have to,

30:02.720 --> 30:04.960
 or you can go out to dinner at a particular time.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.520
 And I guess it makes it kind of tough

30:06.520 --> 30:08.040
 if you want to meet somebody for breakfast,

30:08.040 --> 30:09.880
 because then you're the dork who's just like

30:09.880 --> 30:11.800
 sipping black coffee and like refusing everything.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.420
 But anyway, I've been that dork.

30:14.420 --> 30:17.320
 So it's one of those things you just kind of work with.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.960
 But the fact of the matter is ghrelin secretion,

30:20.960 --> 30:24.140
 because of its relationship to the nervous system,

30:24.140 --> 30:28.960
 can be shifted by about 45 minutes per day.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.080
 Now it's going to vary.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.160
 Some of you have more so-called willpower, you know,

30:33.160 --> 30:35.840
 but if you really want to just start pushing

30:35.840 --> 30:39.260
 that first meal out or shifting it in any direction,

30:39.260 --> 30:40.900
 some people might want to eat in the early part of the day

30:40.900 --> 30:42.020
 and not in the evening,

30:42.020 --> 30:44.080
 trying to shift the meal times out,

30:44.080 --> 30:45.760
 the spacing by about 45 minutes

30:45.760 --> 30:50.360
 is what the neural circuits that link the ghrelin system

30:50.360 --> 30:52.120
 to the neural circuits that control feeding

30:52.120 --> 30:55.200
 really can handle, because it's a form of neuroplasticity.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.440
 And so what this would look like is

30:56.440 --> 30:58.600
 if you normally you eat breakfast at eight o'clock,

30:58.600 --> 31:00.260
 plus or minus 20 minutes,

31:00.260 --> 31:02.640
 and you want to start eating your first meal at noon,

31:02.640 --> 31:04.260
 you would take maybe four or five days

31:04.260 --> 31:05.480
 and just start pushing the meal out

31:05.480 --> 31:07.740
 by about 45 minutes to an hour each day,

31:07.740 --> 31:09.600
 so it's not quite as painful.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.400
 Or you can just take the plunge and just do it all at once.

31:12.400 --> 31:16.120
 I have a colleague who was a neurosurgeon at Stanford,

31:16.120 --> 31:18.040
 came up through my lab, he's now at Neuralink,

31:18.040 --> 31:19.140
 and he has a great practice.

31:19.140 --> 31:21.400
 He keeps his ghrelin system at random.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.760
 What he does is he skips one meal per day,

31:24.760 --> 31:27.200
 and he makes his external schedule dictate that.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.960
 So sometimes he skips breakfast,

31:28.960 --> 31:30.080
 sometimes he skips lunch,

31:30.080 --> 31:31.080
 sometimes he skips dinner,

31:31.080 --> 31:33.840
 he just skips one of the three major meals per day.

31:33.840 --> 31:34.760
 And in doing that,

31:34.760 --> 31:37.760
 the ghrelin system is always kind of kept off kilter,

31:37.760 --> 31:39.200
 and it probably also allows him

31:39.200 --> 31:41.020
 to have a lot of neural flexibility,

31:41.020 --> 31:42.380
 what we call top-down control,

31:42.380 --> 31:43.220
 just the knowledge,

31:43.220 --> 31:47.160
 oh, the hunger I'm feeling isn't necessarily hypoglycemia,

31:47.160 --> 31:49.420
 and in his case, it's almost certainly not,

31:49.420 --> 31:51.640
 and therefore what I'm feeling here

31:51.640 --> 31:54.200
 is an activation of these AGRP neurons,

31:54.200 --> 31:56.040
 and therefore I can push my meal schedule

31:56.040 --> 31:57.640
 around however I want.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.600
 Now, I should mention that top-down mechanisms

31:59.600 --> 32:02.080
 are powerful, belief, motivation,

32:02.080 --> 32:03.980
 these things can really shift neural circuits.

32:03.980 --> 32:06.560
 We're going to talk more about that a little bit later.

32:06.560 --> 32:10.300
 But there are also people who are genuinely hypoglycemic

32:10.300 --> 32:11.720
 and that need to take really good control

32:11.720 --> 32:14.000
 of their blood sugar levels and try and keep them stable.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.360
 And so, of course,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.200
 you want to do what's medically safe for you.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.460
 I'm not at all recommending that people

32:19.460 --> 32:22.320
 that suffer from hypoglycemia suddenly

32:22.320 --> 32:25.280
 disrupt their blood sugar patterns in any direction.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.480
 That wouldn't be healthy.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.540
 But for most people out there

32:27.540 --> 32:30.740
 who have reasonable blood glucose levels,

32:30.740 --> 32:32.280
 it's kind of interesting and kind of fun

32:32.280 --> 32:33.760
 to play with these parameters

32:33.760 --> 32:35.600
 in order to optimize what you want to do.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.600
 And sometimes that might change

32:36.600 --> 32:38.280
 across the year with schedules.

32:38.280 --> 32:42.200
 Many people find great benefit in having flexibility

32:42.200 --> 32:43.580
 over when they eat.

32:43.580 --> 32:47.040
 Regularity of eating equals regularity of ghrelin secretion

32:47.040 --> 32:50.080
 equals regularity of activity of these AGRP neurons,

32:50.080 --> 32:53.200
 meaning you will be hungry at very regular intervals.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.500
 So that's something that you can work with.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.140
 It's grounded in deep mechanism of hormone

32:57.140 --> 32:58.620
 and neural systems.

32:58.620 --> 33:00.400
 And there's a lot of modern research

33:00.400 --> 33:02.200
 to support what I just said.

33:02.200 --> 33:06.440
 So if MSH inhibits feeding, makes us want to eat less,

33:06.440 --> 33:10.140
 and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,

33:10.140 --> 33:14.680
 there's another hormone called CCK, cholecystokinin,

33:14.680 --> 33:19.480
 that is potent in reducing our levels of hunger.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.300
 Now, I learned about CCK back when I was an undergraduate,

33:22.300 --> 33:27.300
 so well over 20 years ago, when it was first discovered,

33:27.380 --> 33:30.440
 and there was a lot of excitement about CCK at that point

33:30.440 --> 33:32.440
 as a diet drug.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.940
 Anytime there's a molecule or a chemical

33:34.940 --> 33:38.520
 discovered in the brain or body that can suppress feeding,

33:38.520 --> 33:40.920
 the diet industry just goes wild.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.200
 They think, okay, this is going to be the thing

33:42.200 --> 33:45.320
 that's going to allow people to move from being obese

33:45.320 --> 33:48.820
 to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight, et cetera.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.700
 A similar phenomenon was observed with leptin.

33:51.700 --> 33:55.600
 Leptin is a hormone that's made by body fat

33:55.600 --> 33:58.840
 that signals to the brain when there's a lot of body fat,

33:58.840 --> 34:01.080
 and in animals, injections of leptin

34:01.080 --> 34:02.860
 can make fat animals thin.

34:02.860 --> 34:05.800
 They lose a lot of adipose or fat.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.000
 In humans, it didn't work out that way.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.020
 It just, the studies were done,

34:10.020 --> 34:12.840
 and leptin was successful in treating a certain rare form

34:12.840 --> 34:15.480
 of diabetes, but it really wasn't very potent

34:15.480 --> 34:17.340
 as an anti-obesity drug.

34:17.340 --> 34:22.340
 Similarly, CCK has been looked at as an obesity drug,

34:23.520 --> 34:25.520
 something to reduce obesity,

34:25.520 --> 34:29.120
 but it had some pretty unhappy side effects,

34:29.120 --> 34:31.400
 actually caused some pretty serious side effects.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.300
 Now that's as a drug.

34:33.300 --> 34:38.300
 However, CCK, when released at normal levels by your gut,

34:38.300 --> 34:42.140
 has a powerful effect in suppressing appetite

34:42.140 --> 34:44.620
 for a period of time, and there are healthy

34:44.620 --> 34:48.380
 and direct ways to activate CCK.

34:48.380 --> 34:52.060
 Now, CCK is in the GI tract.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.900
 It's released from the GI tract,

34:53.900 --> 34:56.640
 and its release is governed by two things.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.920
 One is a subset of very specialized neurons

34:59.920 --> 35:01.640
 that detect what's in the gut,

35:01.640 --> 35:04.240
 the specific contents of the gut,

35:04.240 --> 35:07.500
 and by certain elements of the mucosa,

35:07.500 --> 35:11.220
 the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microbiome.

35:11.220 --> 35:16.220
 So what's really interesting is that CCK is stimulated

35:16.700 --> 35:20.460
 by fatty acids and particular fatty acids

35:20.460 --> 35:23.540
 that we'll talk about, amino acids

35:23.540 --> 35:26.460
 and particular amino acids that we'll talk about,

35:26.460 --> 35:28.900
 as well as by sugar.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.060
 Now let's put sugar on the shelf for a moment.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.680
 We're going to talk a lot about sugar

35:32.680 --> 35:37.680
 because if CCK inhibits appetite and reduces feeding,

35:37.700 --> 35:42.160
 and it can be triggered by fatty acids, amino acids,

35:42.160 --> 35:43.860
 or sugars, then you might say,

35:43.860 --> 35:45.380
 well, then eating a lot of sugar

35:45.380 --> 35:47.240
 should make us not want to eat more,

35:47.240 --> 35:49.180
 but we all know that eating sugar

35:49.180 --> 35:52.120
 makes us want to eat far more.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.980
 That's the role of a lot of sugars,

35:53.980 --> 35:55.720
 and that has to do with a separate mechanism

35:55.720 --> 35:57.500
 we'll talk about today.

35:57.500 --> 36:02.100
 So which fatty acids in the gut stimulate the release of CCK?

36:02.100 --> 36:04.760
 It turns out it's the omega-3 fatty acids,

36:04.760 --> 36:08.160
 the ones that come from algae or krill or fish oil.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.840
 I talked about this in the episode on nutrition

36:10.840 --> 36:13.740
 and some of the things related to the gut microbiome,

36:13.740 --> 36:15.380
 but I'm going to revisit that now.

36:16.380 --> 36:21.380
 Omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,

36:21.980 --> 36:24.400
 either from food or from supplements,

36:24.400 --> 36:26.520
 stimulate the release of CCK,

36:26.520 --> 36:29.780
 which then reduces or at least blunts appetite.

36:29.780 --> 36:31.620
 And I'm not talking about blunting appetite

36:31.620 --> 36:33.920
 to anorexic levels where you don't want to eat at all.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.460
 I'm talking about regulating appetite

36:35.460 --> 36:38.580
 to the point where animals and people don't over-consume.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.960
 So it's keeping appetite at a healthy level.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.700
 The other thing that stimulates CCK that I mentioned

36:44.700 --> 36:46.180
 are amino acids.

36:46.180 --> 36:48.700
 So when we eat, we have the ability

36:48.700 --> 36:51.860
 to break down different macronutrients,

36:51.860 --> 36:55.700
 you know, carbohydrates, fats, or proteins

36:55.700 --> 36:59.380
 into sugars and glucose that then we can convert to ATP

36:59.380 --> 37:01.420
 and all that stuff from the Krebs cycle from high school.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.500
 We're not going to go into that today.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.140
 That's for a future episode.

37:04.140 --> 37:07.420
 But amino acids are one of the things

37:07.420 --> 37:09.100
 that we are eating for.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.740
 Amino acids both can be used as energy

37:12.740 --> 37:15.160
 through a process called gluconeogenesis

37:15.160 --> 37:17.360
 of converting proteins into energy,

37:17.360 --> 37:19.820
 or those amino acids can be broken down

37:19.820 --> 37:22.940
 and then rebuilt into things like preparing, excuse me,

37:22.940 --> 37:24.160
 repairing muscle tissue,

37:24.160 --> 37:26.440
 as well as other forms of cellular repair.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.500
 They're involved in all sorts of things

37:27.500 --> 37:29.660
 related to protein synthesis.

37:29.660 --> 37:31.240
 What does this mean?

37:31.240 --> 37:35.100
 If we eat the proper amino acids at the proper levels,

37:35.100 --> 37:38.740
 if we ingest omega-3s and CLAs, conjugated linoleic acids,

37:38.740 --> 37:41.540
 at the proper levels, or get them from supplements,

37:41.540 --> 37:43.400
 there is a blunting of appetite.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.480
 Appetite is kept clamped and we don't become hyperphagic.

37:46.480 --> 37:47.560
 We don't overeat.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.600
 We tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.660
 So this is very important

37:52.660 --> 37:56.140
 because most people don't understand

37:56.140 --> 37:57.520
 that when we're eating,

37:57.520 --> 38:02.020
 we are basically fat foraging and amino acid foraging.

38:02.020 --> 38:04.600
 And there are several studies now have shown

38:04.600 --> 38:07.160
 that people and animals will essentially eat

38:07.160 --> 38:11.540
 until they feel they've consumed enough omega-3s,

38:11.540 --> 38:15.620
 omega-6s, CLAs, and certain amino acids.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.540
 In other words, even if it's not conscious,

38:18.540 --> 38:21.780
 we are eating until we trigger the activation of CCK.

38:21.780 --> 38:24.580
 Now, there are other reasons why we shut down eating too.

38:24.580 --> 38:28.060
 Literally, the volume of food in our gut can be large

38:28.060 --> 38:29.980
 and we can feel very distended.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.420
 That's the physical reason, obviously.

38:33.420 --> 38:34.820
 There are other reasons.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.000
 Maybe we just have top-down control.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.940
 We have knowledge that this is the end of the meal

38:39.940 --> 38:41.340
 and we stop because we have to go back to work

38:41.340 --> 38:44.460
 or to a meeting, or we tell ourselves that we've had enough.

38:44.460 --> 38:48.060
 But at a subconscious level,

38:48.060 --> 38:52.140
 the gut is informing the brain via CCK and other mechanisms

38:52.140 --> 38:54.420
 when we've ingested enough of what we need.

38:54.420 --> 38:58.380
 And these omega-3s and CLAs and certain amino acids

38:58.380 --> 39:00.680
 are vital for sending out that signal

39:00.680 --> 39:01.800
 that we've had enough.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.600
 Now, which amino acids is actually really interesting?

39:04.600 --> 39:05.860
 We have essential amino acids

39:05.860 --> 39:07.980
 and we have non-essential amino acids.

39:07.980 --> 39:10.340
 Among the essential amino acids,

39:10.340 --> 39:12.700
 there's one in particular that can trigger the release

39:12.700 --> 39:16.700
 of CCK very potently, and that's glutamine.

39:16.700 --> 39:19.220
 Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.

39:19.220 --> 39:22.220
 First of all, it's been shown in a few studies

39:22.220 --> 39:25.340
 to play a role in bolstering the immune system.

39:25.340 --> 39:27.340
 It can increase the number of killer cells

39:27.340 --> 39:28.380
 in the immune system.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.560
 It is consumed in supplement form.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.540
 People can take a teaspoon of glutamine

39:33.540 --> 39:35.740
 or some people take glutamine throughout the day

39:35.740 --> 39:37.980
 if they're really into it or for whatever reason

39:37.980 --> 39:39.540
 they think they're battling off an infection

39:39.540 --> 39:41.060
 or something of that sort.

39:41.060 --> 39:43.580
 Glutamine can also, of course, be derived from foods.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.940
 And you can just put into the internet,

39:45.940 --> 39:47.400
 do an internet search and find out

39:47.400 --> 39:48.740
 what foods are rich with glutamine.

39:48.740 --> 39:51.140
 Some of the ones that I'm aware of off the top of my head

39:51.140 --> 39:53.180
 are like cottage cheese and things of that sort,

39:53.180 --> 39:55.180
 but other foods have glutamine as well.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.100
 Once a threshold level of glutamine

39:59.100 --> 40:01.420
 and other essential amino acids are reached,

40:01.420 --> 40:04.420
 once the threshold level of these Alpha-3,

40:04.420 --> 40:07.620
 excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids and CLAs are reached,

40:07.620 --> 40:11.660
 CCK is released and it helps reduce the activity

40:11.660 --> 40:14.900
 of those AGRP neurons that promote feeding.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.860
 So as you can see, feeding is an interplay

40:16.860 --> 40:18.420
 between brain and body.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.100
 And it's some of the micronutrients

40:20.100 --> 40:22.180
 and even the breakdown of particular nutrients

40:22.180 --> 40:24.100
 that's putting the accelerator

40:24.100 --> 40:26.040
 or the brake on the feeding process.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.700
 It's not just one thing.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.640
 So from an actionable standpoint,

40:31.140 --> 40:34.060
 you, we should probably all be trying to get

40:34.060 --> 40:37.460
 our Omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,

40:37.460 --> 40:39.180
 because they are antidepressant.

40:39.180 --> 40:41.720
 I talked about the peer-reviewed studies on that.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.020
 They are healthy for the gut microbiome

40:44.020 --> 40:47.420
 and we should be seeking sufficient glutamine.

40:47.420 --> 40:49.060
 Now, whether or not you decide to supplement

40:49.060 --> 40:50.920
 with glutamine or not is up to you.

40:52.260 --> 40:55.060
 One of the reasons why one might want to do that,

40:55.060 --> 40:56.840
 and again, you should always check with a doctor,

40:56.840 --> 40:59.280
 especially if you have any predisposition to cancers

40:59.280 --> 41:03.620
 or you have cancer, many cancers and tumors like glutamine.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.980
 So that's something to note.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.620
 But one reason why you might want to supplement

41:07.620 --> 41:09.580
 with glutamine or consider eating foods

41:09.580 --> 41:10.660
 that are rich in glutamine,

41:10.660 --> 41:13.700
 isn't just to keep your appetite in healthy ranges,

41:13.700 --> 41:18.500
 but as well, glutamine can actually reduce sugar cravings.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.940
 So this is very interesting.

41:19.940 --> 41:22.980
 I have a friend, he's an absolute chocolate sweets addict.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.940
 He's a grown adult, but he eats candy and chocolate

41:26.940 --> 41:29.820
 as if it was, you know, as if he was like a 14 year old kid

41:29.820 --> 41:31.620
 hanging out at the local convenience store.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.280
 It's really incredible.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.940
 And he has probably a sugar addiction,

41:36.940 --> 41:38.060
 but he's very aware of this

41:38.060 --> 41:40.380
 and he's managed to kick all other addictions.

41:40.380 --> 41:43.400
 So for whatever reason, it stimulates his brain and body

41:43.400 --> 41:45.880
 in the ways that make him want more, but he hates this.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.900
 It's actually quite frustrating for him.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.180
 And he's somebody who cares a lot about his health.

41:50.180 --> 41:53.400
 He took the approach that I know many other people have

41:53.400 --> 41:55.180
 who know about this role of glutamine

41:55.180 --> 41:58.740
 of taking a teaspoon or a couple of teaspoons of glutamine

41:58.740 --> 42:00.060
 several times throughout the day,

42:00.060 --> 42:02.620
 or anytime he craves sugar.

42:02.620 --> 42:05.940
 And indeed, glutamine will reduce sugar cravings.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.560
 Some people who are really on the kind of ketogenic front

42:09.560 --> 42:11.120
 will mix it with a little bit of half and half

42:11.120 --> 42:13.060
 and down that, because I guess it makes it taste better,

42:13.060 --> 42:14.320
 it's a little bit chalky.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.800
 So glutamine has some very interesting properties,

42:16.800 --> 42:18.680
 but I think for most people that aren't suffering

42:18.680 --> 42:20.900
 from adverse levels of craving,

42:22.020 --> 42:24.440
 making sure you're getting the right omega-3s,

42:24.440 --> 42:26.480
 that can come from a variety of sources.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.540
 Check out the episode we did on nutrition

42:29.540 --> 42:32.920
 if you want to learn more about that, and CLAs,

42:32.920 --> 42:35.040
 and making sure that you're getting enough glutamine

42:35.040 --> 42:36.440
 is going to be important for making sure

42:36.440 --> 42:39.220
 that the CCK signal gets through.

42:39.220 --> 42:41.100
 The one thing I do want to mention about glutamine,

42:41.100 --> 42:46.100
 it's a minor effect, but it alone can have a small increase,

42:46.100 --> 42:49.180
 excuse me, it alone can increase blood sugar.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.380
 It's not a huge increase in blood glucose,

42:51.380 --> 42:53.540
 but because the gut takes proteins

42:53.540 --> 42:55.620
 and breaks them down into these amino acids

42:55.620 --> 42:58.460
 and essentially looking for glutamine and things like it,

42:58.460 --> 43:00.280
 other essential amino acids as well,

43:01.140 --> 43:03.940
 when you ingest glutamine or branched-chain amino acids,

43:03.940 --> 43:08.820
 there is a small but real increase in blood glucose,

43:08.820 --> 43:11.300
 and that's because they are essentially food,

43:11.300 --> 43:13.380
 and there I'm talking about the supplemental version.

43:13.380 --> 43:17.660
 So just know glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly,

43:17.660 --> 43:19.380
 especially diabetics should know that.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.520
 It can reduce sugar cravings,

43:21.520 --> 43:25.060
 and just know that what your gut is doing at a core level

43:25.060 --> 43:26.580
 is it's forging, it's waiting,

43:26.580 --> 43:29.620
 and it's trying to assess levels of omega-3 fatty acids,

43:29.620 --> 43:31.460
 conjugated linoleic acid,

43:31.460 --> 43:33.360
 and glutamine and other essential amino acids.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.020
 You are essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients,

43:37.020 --> 43:39.360
 and then a signal can be deployed up to your brain

43:39.360 --> 43:42.900
 that you're not really interested in eating that much more.

43:42.900 --> 43:45.060
 Whenever preparing an episode for this podcast,

43:45.060 --> 43:47.260
 I'm always faced with a particular challenge,

43:47.260 --> 43:49.460
 which is how many tools should I offer

43:49.460 --> 43:51.620
 that involve doing something new,

43:51.620 --> 43:53.820
 you know, a new behavior or a new exercise,

43:53.820 --> 43:55.860
 supplements, something, things of that sort,

43:55.860 --> 43:58.860
 and how many should be related to not doing things,

43:58.860 --> 43:59.700
 avoiding things.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.380
 It's never really fun to talk about all the things

44:01.380 --> 44:02.540
 that we're supposed to avoid,

44:02.540 --> 44:04.780
 but some of them are so powerful

44:04.780 --> 44:08.120
 in light of the mechanisms of a given topic

44:08.120 --> 44:10.980
 that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them.

44:10.980 --> 44:14.240
 So now you understand how hormones and peptides

44:14.240 --> 44:16.800
 like CCK and ghrelin impact appetite.

44:17.700 --> 44:20.600
 There's one particular aspect of food

44:20.600 --> 44:22.740
 that can powerfully impact CCK,

44:22.740 --> 44:24.340
 and I think most people,

44:24.340 --> 44:26.460
 I'm guessing 99.9% of people out there

44:26.460 --> 44:28.320
 are not aware of this,

44:28.320 --> 44:30.940
 and it has to do with highly processed foods.

44:30.940 --> 44:32.700
 There's a lot of reasons why one would want

44:32.700 --> 44:34.980
 to avoid highly processed foods.

44:34.980 --> 44:36.580
 In fact, if you're interested in that topic

44:36.580 --> 44:38.860
 and the history of whole foods

44:38.860 --> 44:40.900
 transitioning to highly processed foods in this country,

44:40.900 --> 44:43.780
 I highly recommend you listen to a YouTube video

44:43.780 --> 44:45.460
 by Dr. Robert Lustig.

44:45.460 --> 44:47.500
 He's at University of California, San Francisco.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.580
 It's very easy to find.

44:48.580 --> 44:50.480
 Put Stanford, Robert Lustig.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.380
 It was a talk hosted by Stanford.

44:52.380 --> 44:55.540
 Gives a beautiful description of the history of this

44:55.540 --> 44:58.140
 and why the food industry started packing in

44:58.140 --> 44:59.780
 additional sugars and salts

44:59.780 --> 45:01.700
 and turning foods into commodities.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.420
 It's really fascinating.

45:03.420 --> 45:04.780
 It has no conspiracy theory.

45:04.780 --> 45:06.540
 It's just all scientific facts.

45:06.540 --> 45:07.940
 It's really a wonderful lecture.

45:07.940 --> 45:11.360
 It has millions of views, should be very easy to find.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.380
 We can provide a link to that and we will.

45:14.380 --> 45:16.140
 There's another reason to avoid

45:16.140 --> 45:18.220
 highly processed foods, however,

45:18.220 --> 45:22.020
 and that has to do with what's called emulsifiers.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.940
 Now, many of you are familiar with emulsifiers

45:23.940 --> 45:25.220
 even though you don't know it.

45:25.220 --> 45:28.180
 When you put detergent in the laundry,

45:28.180 --> 45:31.100
 that contains emulsifiers.

45:31.100 --> 45:33.620
 The goal of that detergent is to bring together

45:33.620 --> 45:36.220
 fatty molecules with water molecules

45:36.220 --> 45:38.420
 and be able to dissociate them and break them up

45:38.420 --> 45:42.140
 to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort.

45:42.140 --> 45:46.540
 There are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed foods.

45:46.540 --> 45:49.760
 And those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions

45:49.760 --> 45:52.120
 to occur that extends the shelf life of those foods.

45:52.120 --> 45:54.560
 So it's like candy bars and cereals

45:54.560 --> 45:57.520
 and all sorts of things that are in processed foods.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.340
 The worst of which are the typical kind of pastries

46:00.340 --> 46:01.540
 that you see at the convenience store,

46:01.540 --> 46:04.500
 but this extends into chips of various kinds

46:04.500 --> 46:06.380
 and even some meats of various kinds.

46:06.380 --> 46:07.700
 They pack this stuff into meats.

46:07.700 --> 46:10.560
 They have names like soy lecithin and other things.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.460
 Why are emulsifiers bad?

46:12.460 --> 46:14.000
 Okay, there are a lot of reasons why they're bad,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.340
 but the reason why they're bad for the mechanisms

46:16.340 --> 46:17.980
 that we've been talking about today

46:17.980 --> 46:20.380
 is that when you ingest those foods,

46:20.380 --> 46:23.060
 you're bringing those emulsifiers into your gut.

46:23.060 --> 46:26.100
 And those emulsifiers strip away

46:26.100 --> 46:28.220
 the mucosal lining of the gut,

46:28.220 --> 46:31.540
 and they actually cause the neurons that innervate the gut

46:31.540 --> 46:33.060
 that extend those little processes

46:33.060 --> 46:34.940
 that we call axons into the gut

46:34.940 --> 46:37.620
 to retract deeper into the gut.

46:37.620 --> 46:40.780
 And as a consequence, you're ingesting a bunch of food

46:40.780 --> 46:43.900
 and the signals like CCK never get deployed.

46:43.900 --> 46:46.220
 The signals that actually shut down hunger

46:46.220 --> 46:47.640
 are never actually triggered.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.940
 And so as a consequence, you want to eat far more

46:49.940 --> 46:51.680
 of these highly processed foods.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.060
 In addition, if you then go from eating

46:54.060 --> 46:57.420
 a highly processed food to non-highly processed foods,

46:57.420 --> 47:01.220
 you're not able to measure the amounts of amino acids,

47:01.220 --> 47:04.460
 sugars, and fatty acids in those foods as accurately.

47:04.460 --> 47:07.780
 You've actually done structural damage at a micro level,

47:07.780 --> 47:10.160
 but structural damage, excuse me,

47:10.160 --> 47:11.820
 to the mucosal lining of the gut.

47:11.820 --> 47:13.860
 Now, this can all be repaired if you stay away

47:13.860 --> 47:16.260
 from highly processed foods for some period of time,

47:16.260 --> 47:18.500
 but the negative effects of these emulsifiers

47:18.500 --> 47:19.740
 are quite real.

47:19.740 --> 47:22.340
 So to make it really clean and simple,

47:23.320 --> 47:25.660
 emulsifiers from highly processed foods

47:25.660 --> 47:27.620
 are limiting your gut's ability

47:27.620 --> 47:29.420
 to detect what's in the foods you eat

47:29.420 --> 47:31.800
 and therefore to deploy the satiety signals,

47:31.800 --> 47:33.680
 the signals that shut down hunger.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.700
 In addition to that, there's a parallel mechanism at play

47:36.700 --> 47:38.540
 that I talked about in a previous episode,

47:38.540 --> 47:41.380
 but I'll remind you again that you have neurons in your gut

47:41.380 --> 47:45.960
 that are sensing sugar and are sending a subconscious signal

47:45.960 --> 47:48.380
 up to the brain via the vagus nerve.

47:49.380 --> 47:52.300
 And those neurons trigger the release of dopamine,

47:52.300 --> 47:54.100
 which makes you crave more of that food.

47:54.100 --> 47:56.340
 So now you've got parallel signals

47:56.340 --> 47:58.240
 making you want to eat more sugar,

47:58.240 --> 48:00.420
 making you unaware of how much sugar you've eaten

48:00.420 --> 48:04.580
 and that are disrupting the inputs to the nervous system

48:04.580 --> 48:06.360
 that signal to the rest of your brain and body

48:06.360 --> 48:08.420
 that you've obtained enough fatty acids

48:08.420 --> 48:10.940
 and you've obtained enough amino acids.

48:10.940 --> 48:14.020
 So these highly processed foods are really terrible.

48:14.020 --> 48:16.140
 And I'm not out here to say,

48:16.140 --> 48:18.540
 never enjoy a processed food of any kind.

48:18.540 --> 48:19.380
 I'd be a hypocrite

48:19.380 --> 48:21.480
 because I do eat processed foods from time to time.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.140
 Although the ones that I tend to eat,

48:23.140 --> 48:24.760
 I try and make of the healthier variety,

48:24.760 --> 48:27.840
 but eating whole foods has tremendous value

48:27.840 --> 48:29.700
 and eating highly processed food

48:29.700 --> 48:32.860
 has tremendous negative impact on the gut

48:32.860 --> 48:34.500
 and on the gut brain axis.

48:34.500 --> 48:37.940
 And so recently there was a paper that came out in Cell,

48:37.940 --> 48:38.780
 Cell Press Journal.

48:38.780 --> 48:41.980
 It's kind of the apex of cell journals, which is phenomenal.

48:41.980 --> 48:45.580
 This paper showed that ingesting highly processed food

48:45.580 --> 48:49.400
 leads to more intake of not just highly processed foods,

48:49.400 --> 48:51.820
 but other types of food in general.

48:51.820 --> 48:54.060
 There was kind of an overeating compensation

48:54.060 --> 48:55.720
 generally across foods

48:55.720 --> 48:57.700
 for people that consume these highly processed foods.

48:57.700 --> 48:58.860
 And there are a lot of other reasons

48:58.860 --> 49:00.420
 to avoid highly processed foods.

49:00.420 --> 49:02.940
 So again, I don't like to focus too much on the do nots.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.320
 I like to arm you with tools to do,

49:05.320 --> 49:08.040
 but I think this visual of certain foods

49:08.040 --> 49:10.160
 and these emulsifiers actually stripping away

49:10.160 --> 49:12.520
 some of the critical lining of your gut

49:12.520 --> 49:14.280
 and disrupting the hormone signaling

49:14.280 --> 49:15.880
 to the brain controlling feeding

49:15.880 --> 49:19.220
 is important enough and cryptic enough,

49:19.220 --> 49:21.000
 meaning it hasn't been talked about,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.080
 it works at a subconscious level,

49:23.080 --> 49:25.960
 and that it's important that people are aware of it

49:25.960 --> 49:26.880
 so they can make decisions

49:26.880 --> 49:27.900
 about what they do want to eat

49:27.900 --> 49:29.900
 or not want to eat for themselves.

49:29.900 --> 49:31.980
 Before moving on, I just want to say one more thing

49:31.980 --> 49:34.240
 about highly processed foods.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.800
 There was an absolutely beautiful study

49:36.800 --> 49:39.200
 done by my colleague, Chris Garner at Stanford,

49:39.200 --> 49:41.160
 exploring whether or not certain diets

49:41.160 --> 49:42.180
 were better than others.

49:42.180 --> 49:45.880
 They looked at vegan, vegetarian, omnivore.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.840
 I don't know if they looked at all meat or not,

49:47.840 --> 49:49.340
 but they looked at the different forms of diets,

49:49.340 --> 49:50.800
 intermittent fasting, et cetera.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.600
 And they essentially found

49:52.600 --> 49:55.720
 that whichever diet people adhered to,

49:55.720 --> 49:57.240
 whichever one they followed,

49:57.240 --> 49:59.120
 was equivalent to the others,

49:59.120 --> 50:00.360
 provided that they followed it,

50:00.360 --> 50:02.440
 they lost the equivalent amount of weight.

50:02.440 --> 50:06.260
 There really wasn't a strong effect of the food type

50:06.260 --> 50:08.240
 or the pattern of eating, et cetera.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.920
 However, in a study like that,

50:09.920 --> 50:12.720
 adherence is very high because people are a part of a study.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.400
 And for many people,

50:14.400 --> 50:17.120
 the ability to adhere to a certain eating plan

50:17.120 --> 50:21.440
 is one of the most, if not the most powerful determinants

50:21.440 --> 50:23.120
 of whether or not a given diet,

50:23.120 --> 50:25.520
 meaning nutritional plan, works.

50:25.520 --> 50:28.400
 Now, this thing about highly processed foods, however,

50:28.400 --> 50:32.180
 is really diabolical because it truly says,

50:32.180 --> 50:35.000
 and I think the recent data in cell metabolism

50:35.000 --> 50:36.520
 and other journals really proves

50:36.520 --> 50:38.540
 that a calorie is not a calorie.

50:38.540 --> 50:41.080
 That's absolutely absurd because of these emulsifiers

50:41.080 --> 50:44.300
 and the content of these highly processed foods.

50:44.300 --> 50:47.840
 In fact, the data in humans points to this.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.760
 So what they did is they took inpatient adults,

50:50.760 --> 50:53.000
 so they had total control over their food intake,

50:53.000 --> 50:55.840
 and they received either ultra processed or unprocessed

50:55.840 --> 50:58.400
 diets for 14 days as a short study.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.600
 The diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat,

51:01.600 --> 51:03.200
 fiber, and macronutrients.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.160
 So everything else was matched,

51:04.160 --> 51:08.760
 just processed or non-processed is the major variable.

51:08.760 --> 51:12.360
 And basically what they found is that the people

51:12.360 --> 51:14.600
 who were eating the processed food diet

51:14.600 --> 51:16.840
 happened to eat much more, right?

51:16.840 --> 51:19.320
 This was after this period of putting them on either diet

51:19.320 --> 51:21.280
 and clamping for all other variables.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.040
 Then they would eat much more,

51:23.040 --> 51:25.140
 and the body weight changes were much more.

51:25.140 --> 51:28.780
 And those body weight changes were such

51:28.780 --> 51:30.040
 that they couldn't be accounted for

51:30.040 --> 51:31.640
 by just increased calories.

51:31.640 --> 51:34.680
 So the bottom line is that highly processed foods

51:34.680 --> 51:35.560
 are just bad for you.

51:35.560 --> 51:36.920
 They increase weight gain.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.120
 They disrupt the lining of your gut in a way

51:39.120 --> 51:42.680
 that disrupts things like CCK and proper satiety signals.

51:42.680 --> 51:46.160
 And they contain a bunch of things in particular sugars,

51:46.160 --> 51:47.600
 but other things as well,

51:47.600 --> 51:50.000
 that disrupt not just the hormonal systems,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.480
 but also the neural systems that control the desire to eat

51:53.480 --> 51:55.120
 after the diet is done.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.560
 So there's just so many reasons

51:56.560 --> 51:59.560
 why these highly processed foods are terrible.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.820
 And they can explain a lot of the ill health effects

52:01.820 --> 52:03.860
 that we've seen in the last 50 years,

52:03.860 --> 52:05.760
 not just in the United States, but all over the world.

52:05.760 --> 52:09.160
 The enormous increase in diabetes, juvenile diabetes.

52:10.280 --> 52:14.080
 It's just remarkable how far down the path of bad

52:14.080 --> 52:15.120
 we've gone.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.400
 And it's clear, it's almost a smoking gun

52:17.400 --> 52:18.560
 what the cause of this is.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.920
 If you'd like to learn more about that,

52:19.920 --> 52:22.160
 please refer to the Lustig lecture.

52:22.160 --> 52:27.080
 He also spells out why non-processed foods

52:27.080 --> 52:30.640
 is far more economical in terms of just at the level

52:30.640 --> 52:32.020
 of the household or individual,

52:32.020 --> 52:33.820
 as well as at the societal level.

52:33.820 --> 52:34.820
 Really interesting stuff.

52:34.820 --> 52:36.520
 I highly recommend you check it out.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.440
 So now let's move on to some other hormones

52:38.440 --> 52:41.040
 that regulate hunger and satiety.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.200
 In particular, insulin.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.140
 Now you've probably heard of insulin before.

52:45.140 --> 52:48.540
 Insulin is the thing that's lacking in type one diabetics.

52:48.540 --> 52:50.720
 That's why they have to inject insulin whenever they eat.

52:50.720 --> 52:53.320
 The reason they have to do that is because when they eat,

52:53.320 --> 52:55.800
 their foods are broken down into glucose.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.600
 And in order to shuttle glucose

52:57.600 --> 52:59.640
 to the appropriate tissues in the body,

52:59.640 --> 53:03.380
 and also to keep glucose levels in check, you need insulin.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.900
 So the simplest way to think about insulin and glucose

53:06.900 --> 53:09.000
 is that when you eat,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.180
 that food is broken down into sugars.

53:12.200 --> 53:15.360
 That's true whether or not it's fats or it's sugars,

53:15.360 --> 53:17.880
 or eventually if it's proteins.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.300
 They are oxidized into fuels, as we say.

53:21.400 --> 53:24.960
 And those fuels can be used, as the name fuel implies,

53:24.960 --> 53:25.800
 into energy.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.220
 They're eventually made into ATP.

53:27.220 --> 53:28.400
 There's a bunch of biochemical steps

53:28.400 --> 53:29.840
 that we're not going to go into today,

53:29.840 --> 53:30.820
 but that's essentially how it works.

53:30.820 --> 53:32.800
 You break down food into glucose.

53:32.800 --> 53:33.960
 Now, if you're ketogenic,

53:33.960 --> 53:36.080
 we'll talk about that in a little bit,

53:36.080 --> 53:40.440
 but in general, you eat, food is turned into glucose.

53:41.480 --> 53:44.360
 Your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.200
 Hypoglycemic means too low.

53:46.200 --> 53:48.540
 Hyperglycemic means too high.

53:48.540 --> 53:53.520
 And what they called euglycemic, E-U-glycemic,

53:53.520 --> 53:55.840
 is the healthy range.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.200
 Now, what those healthy ranges are,

53:59.200 --> 54:02.140
 in general, the healthy range, the euglycemic range,

54:02.140 --> 54:06.360
 is about 70 to 100 nanograms per deciliter,

54:06.360 --> 54:07.600
 but most of you aren't walking around

54:07.600 --> 54:08.920
 with a glucose monitor.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.980
 Some of you are, but most of you are not.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.480
 The more important question for us to address right now

54:14.480 --> 54:16.480
 is why is it important that glucose

54:16.480 --> 54:18.040
 be kept at a particular level?

54:18.040 --> 54:21.960
 Once you understand that, keeping glucose in check

54:21.960 --> 54:24.200
 starts to have a rationale behind it,

54:24.200 --> 54:27.320
 and the ways to do that start to make a lot more sense.

54:27.320 --> 54:32.320
 So the reason is, if glucose levels get too high,

54:32.460 --> 54:35.920
 because of the way that our cells, in particular neurons,

54:35.920 --> 54:37.680
 interact with glucose,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.640
 high levels of glucose can damage neurons.

54:41.640 --> 54:42.520
 It can actually kill them.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.920
 You can start getting what are called peripheral,

54:44.920 --> 54:46.640
 excuse me, neuropathies.

54:46.640 --> 54:49.120
 One of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes

54:49.120 --> 54:52.600
 is that people start losing the sensation of touch

54:52.600 --> 54:55.040
 in their fingers or their hands or their feet,

54:55.040 --> 54:56.560
 and they can start going blind.

54:56.560 --> 54:59.640
 There's diabetic retinopathies.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.560
 So it's very important

55:01.560 --> 55:04.600
 that insulin manage your glucose levels.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.680
 Now, there's also type 2 diabetes,

55:06.680 --> 55:10.920
 where there's insulin secreted from the pancreas,

55:10.920 --> 55:13.500
 but people are insulin insensitive.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.680
 There's a disruption in the receptors,

55:15.680 --> 55:18.200
 and insulin insensitivity

55:18.200 --> 55:20.760
 isn't quite the same as having no insulin at all,

55:20.760 --> 55:22.920
 but it parallels some of the same mechanisms.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.040
 Now, type 1 diabetes is often picked up

55:25.040 --> 55:28.520
 because someone has a sudden weight loss

55:28.520 --> 55:30.380
 because they're not processing blood sugar

55:30.380 --> 55:31.600
 the same way they were before.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.520
 Type 2 diabetes is often, although not always,

55:34.520 --> 55:37.960
 associated with being overweight and with obesity.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.820
 Both of them are challenging conditions.

55:40.820 --> 55:43.440
 Type 2 diabetes almost always can be managed

55:43.440 --> 55:45.580
 by managing one's weight.

55:46.600 --> 55:50.040
 And of course, there are prescription drugs

55:50.040 --> 55:51.860
 and supplements that can help manage those.

55:51.860 --> 55:53.640
 We're going to talk about all of that.

55:53.640 --> 55:56.200
 But for most people that don't have diabetes,

55:56.200 --> 55:58.080
 the important thing is to manage glucose,

55:58.080 --> 56:01.200
 to keep it in that euglycemic range.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.460
 And there are a number of different ways to do that.

56:03.460 --> 56:06.880
 Some of them are behavioral, some of them are diet-based,

56:06.880 --> 56:09.780
 and some of them are based on supplements

56:09.780 --> 56:10.680
 or prescription drugs.

56:10.680 --> 56:12.160
 So let's talk about those now.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.920
 So if you eat, and in particular, if you eat carbohydrates,

56:15.920 --> 56:17.320
 blood glucose goes up.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.160
 If you eat fats, blood glucose goes up

56:19.160 --> 56:20.640
 to a far less degree.

56:20.640 --> 56:23.920
 And if you eat proteins, depending on the protein,

56:23.920 --> 56:26.120
 it'll eventually be broken down for fuel

56:26.120 --> 56:29.400
 or assembled into amino acid chains for protein synthesis

56:29.400 --> 56:32.600
 and repair of other tissues and bodily functions.

56:32.600 --> 56:37.320
 But glucose goes up and then is kept in range.

56:37.320 --> 56:40.720
 When you are hungry, you secrete a different hormone,

56:40.720 --> 56:42.440
 and that's called glucagon.

56:42.440 --> 56:47.440
 And glucagon's main role is to pull stores of energy

56:47.900 --> 56:50.840
 out of the liver and the muscles.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.820
 And once those are depleted,

56:52.820 --> 56:55.680
 you'll eventually tap into body fat, okay?

56:55.680 --> 56:56.740
 So, and this is for people

56:56.740 --> 56:58.520
 that have a typical blood glucose range,

56:58.520 --> 57:02.080
 so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range.

57:02.080 --> 57:05.320
 So the two kind of push and pull systems

57:05.320 --> 57:07.480
 that we're going to think about now to keep this simple

57:07.480 --> 57:11.320
 is that you have the insulin system managing glucose,

57:11.320 --> 57:14.520
 and you've got the glucagon system pulling energy

57:14.520 --> 57:18.200
 out of your liver and muscles for immediate fuel.

57:18.200 --> 57:22.440
 And eventually you'll pull fuel out of body fat

57:22.440 --> 57:24.200
 if you've been active for a very long time

57:24.200 --> 57:26.460
 and all your glycogen stores are depleted

57:26.460 --> 57:28.360
 or close to depleted.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.960
 So what does this all mean?

57:29.960 --> 57:32.580
 There's a lot of important biochemistry

57:32.580 --> 57:34.720
 and a lot of important cellular processes involved

57:34.720 --> 57:37.140
 in whether or not you're anabolic or catabolic,

57:37.140 --> 57:38.420
 whether or not you're breaking things down

57:38.420 --> 57:39.520
 or building things up.

57:40.640 --> 57:44.340
 Let's talk about feeding in a simpler way, however,

57:44.340 --> 57:47.560
 and let's weave the tools to manage blood glucose

57:47.560 --> 57:50.240
 to keep it in check as we do that.

57:50.240 --> 57:52.280
 So let's say you had a meal

57:52.280 --> 57:56.220
 and that meal consisted of rice, a carbohydrate,

57:57.500 --> 58:00.720
 some meat or fish, let's say a piece of salmon,

58:00.720 --> 58:02.840
 and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable

58:02.840 --> 58:05.340
 like asparagus or cabbage or something like that.

58:06.280 --> 58:09.000
 If you were to eat all of that at once,

58:09.000 --> 58:10.920
 you take a bite of one, a bite of the other,

58:10.920 --> 58:12.520
 you mix it up, one of these,

58:12.520 --> 58:14.520
 it all ends up in the same place kind of people,

58:14.520 --> 58:17.920
 mix it all up, then you will experience an increase

58:17.920 --> 58:20.440
 in insulin and increase in blood glucose

58:20.440 --> 58:23.400
 that's moderately fast.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.760
 It's going to increase pretty quickly.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.320
 What's remarkable is that the order

58:27.320 --> 58:29.720
 that you consume each macronutrient

58:29.720 --> 58:31.360
 has a pretty profound influence

58:31.360 --> 58:35.960
 on the rate of insulin and glucose secretion

58:35.960 --> 58:39.000
 into the blood and how quickly those levels rise.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.140
 So if you, we'll make it really simple,

58:41.140 --> 58:42.520
 if you were to eat the rice first,

58:42.520 --> 58:44.920
 your glucose would rise in a sharp spike,

58:44.920 --> 58:46.680
 especially if it doesn't contain any fats

58:46.680 --> 58:48.540
 to slow the absorption.

58:48.540 --> 58:51.480
 Now, that might be good if you're very hungry

58:51.480 --> 58:53.880
 and you want to get an increase in glucose.

58:53.880 --> 58:54.880
 In fact, this is the reason

58:54.880 --> 58:57.620
 why you're often served bread before meals

58:57.620 --> 59:00.540
 because it's, and sometimes it's bread and butter,

59:00.540 --> 59:02.840
 but, or chips before meals or appetizer

59:02.840 --> 59:05.120
 are designed to get your blood glucose going up high

59:05.120 --> 59:07.900
 because big steep increases in blood glucose

59:08.900 --> 59:12.240
 tend to promote the desire to consume more glucose.

59:12.240 --> 59:14.800
 And this also relates to the dopamine system

59:14.800 --> 59:17.060
 and the way that something tasty in the mouth

59:17.060 --> 59:20.720
 and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the mouth

59:20.720 --> 59:23.400
 trigger the activation of a lot of systems

59:23.400 --> 59:26.380
 in the brain and body to consume more of whatever you have

59:26.380 --> 59:28.520
 or whatever is available to you.

59:28.520 --> 59:33.520
 So the basic idea is that eating carbohydrates and or fats

59:33.960 --> 59:37.320
 early in a meal will give a steep rise in blood glucose.

59:38.540 --> 59:40.960
 However, if you were to eat the fibrous thing first,

59:40.960 --> 59:43.520
 so a lot of chewing, but not a big rise in blood glucose,

59:43.520 --> 59:44.440
 because in general there's,

59:44.440 --> 59:45.900
 unless it's laden with sugar or something,

59:45.900 --> 59:50.640
 we're just talking about some vegetable, fibrous vegetable,

59:50.640 --> 59:54.640
 that will actually blunt the release of glucose

59:54.640 --> 59:57.300
 until you eat the fish and the rice,

59:57.300 --> 59:59.320
 but believe it or not, it will actually blunt

59:59.320 --> 1:00:02.980
 the glucose increase that the rice would cause.

1:00:02.980 --> 1:00:04.480
 Now I'm not talking about neurotically

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:06.680
 eating each macronutrient separately in sequence,

1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:07.880
 I'm just trying to give you a picture

1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:09.940
 of what's happening ordinarily.

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:12.380
 So what this means is if you feel

1:00:12.380 --> 1:00:14.900
 a lot of food-related anxiety,

1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:16.480
 or you feel you're one of these people

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:19.540
 that you can kind of sense like your blood sugar

1:00:19.540 --> 1:00:22.140
 increasing very quickly, a lot of people can sense this,

1:00:22.140 --> 1:00:23.760
 some people can't, has a lot to do

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:25.520
 with how well they manage their blood sugar,

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:27.560
 as well as some of the psychological factors.

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:29.800
 And yes, there are family and historical reasons

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.800
 where I've got friends who had a lot of siblings,

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:32.980
 and when they sit down to eat,

1:00:32.980 --> 1:00:34.420
 they have to really suppress the desire

1:00:34.420 --> 1:00:37.720
 to not beat up everyone else at the table

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:39.920
 and take all the food, it's sort of like not,

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:42.360
 it's hard for them to understand

1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:45.380
 that there's plenty to go around because of their upbringing,

1:00:45.380 --> 1:00:47.740
 so there are psychological top-down effects.

1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:50.340
 A lot of the psychology around food

1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:52.080
 is geared towards getting people to be relaxed

1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:53.760
 when they eat and these sorts of things,

1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:55.560
 but these blood sugar effects are real,

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.700
 just cellar and basic biochemistry

1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:02.800
 of how the body manages sugars ingested into the blood.

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.580
 So what does this all mean?

1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:07.700
 It means that if you want a steep increase in glucose,

1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:08.800
 you are very, very hungry,

1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:12.360
 then you should eat the carbohydrate-laden food first,

1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:15.000
 or you should eat a bunch of macronutrients combined,

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.980
 so that would be like the hamburger or the sandwich,

1:01:16.980 --> 1:01:20.780
 the bread, the whatever's in that sandwich altogether,

1:01:20.780 --> 1:01:23.880
 usually that's protein and vegetables as well.

1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:28.280
 If you want to have a kind of more modest

1:01:28.280 --> 1:01:30.100
 increase in glucose or you want to blunt

1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:31.200
 the increase in glucose,

1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:35.440
 then have at least some of the fibrous thing first,

1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:38.140
 and then the protein, and then the carbohydrate,

1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:39.760
 you will notice that your blood glucose

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:42.560
 will rise more steadily,

1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:45.800
 and that you'll achieve satiety earlier in the meal,

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:48.160
 or at least you won't get this huge peak,

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:50.360
 it's sort of the Thanksgiving meal effect,

1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:51.440
 some of you are international,

1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:53.400
 so if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving,

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:55.320
 it's a time of year where,

1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:57.280
 used to be the one time of year or two times a year

1:01:57.280 --> 1:01:58.920
 where Americans would give themselves permission

1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:00.840
 to eat enormous meals,

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:02.820
 now that seems to happen a lot more often,

1:02:02.820 --> 1:02:04.620
 but there is this effect of you're full

1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:05.900
 and yet you're hungry for more,

1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:07.800
 that's because your blood glucose has gone through the roof

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:10.100
 and it's triggered a number of other mechanisms.

1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:12.560
 There's also usually a lot of alcohol consumption,

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:17.640
 and alcohol itself, because it's a sugar,

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:21.080
 will increase blood glucose very, very sharply,

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:22.520
 it depends on the alcohol,

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:24.440
 some alcohols have more sugar than others,

1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:26.120
 but basically what you're trying to avoid

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.600
 are steep increases in blood sugar,

1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:28.960
 and the order that you eat foods

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:31.140
 has an enormous impact on that,

1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:32.800
 the other thing that has an enormous impact

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:36.380
 on how long and shallow or how steep

1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:39.440
 that curve of glucose is,

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:42.800
 depends on whether or not you recently were moving,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:45.560
 are moving, or start moving after you eat,

1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:48.880
 so it turns out that your blood glucose levels

1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:52.340
 can be modulated very, very powerfully by movement,

1:02:52.340 --> 1:02:55.020
 if you did any kind of intense exercise,

1:02:55.020 --> 1:02:58.120
 or even just walking or jogging or cycling,

1:02:58.120 --> 1:02:59.140
 anything before you eat,

1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:01.240
 your blood glucose levels will be dampened somewhat,

1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:04.500
 and that has to do with the release of something called,

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:07.020
 some people call it GLUT4, which sounds like glutton,

1:03:07.020 --> 1:03:08.940
 other people call it GLUT4,

1:03:08.940 --> 1:03:11.820
 these are things that are involved in shuttling glucose

1:03:11.820 --> 1:03:13.320
 to particular cells in the body,

1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:15.240
 namely toward muscle and glycogen stores

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:17.380
 and away from body fat stores,

1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:19.720
 it has to do a sequestering of glucose from the blood,

1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:21.800
 the point is that if you're somebody

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:23.520
 who struggles with blood sugar regulation,

1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.120
 in addition to getting your body weight in a healthy range,

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:29.720
 doing all the other sorts of things that you should be doing,

1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:34.280
 the key thing is to try and get some movement,

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.060
 sometime circa meal,

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:38.200
 now very few people can actually eat and walk

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.440
 at the same time, although I do it all the time,

1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:42.060
 not because I'm trying to regulate my blood sugar,

1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:44.040
 but just because I tend to be busy, I eat and drive,

1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:47.400
 so basically if I'm not giving this podcast or sleeping,

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:50.540
 I'm eating, except the early part of the day when I fast,

1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:53.680
 but the bottom line here is that if you, for instance,

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.300
 take a 30 minute walk after a meal,

1:03:57.300 --> 1:03:59.160
 your blood glucose will be blunted

1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:01.100
 in ways that are beneficial,

1:04:01.100 --> 1:04:04.740
 if you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal,

1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:05.740
 that can be beneficial,

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:07.840
 the order that you consume foods is beneficial,

1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:09.880
 and there are a few things that you can consume

1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:12.220
 that can also adjust blood glucose levels,

1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:13.360
 so let's talk about those,

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:15.800
 but I thought it was important to really tamp down

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:18.040
 that it's not just what you eat,

1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:19.120
 we talked about that before,

1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:21.300
 but also the order that you eat those things,

1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:22.140
 believe it or not,

1:04:22.140 --> 1:04:23.960
 whether or not you combine macronutrients,

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:27.940
 carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and fibrous vegetables,

1:04:27.940 --> 1:04:31.000
 and whether or not you've moved recently,

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.440
 the higher intensity of the movement,

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:35.020
 the greater the Glut4 increase,

1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:37.440
 and the more that the blood glucose will be blunted,

1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:38.520
 and you'll shuttle more of that

1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:40.160
 to glycogen and muscle stores,

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:42.440
 and even just moving after a meal,

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:44.940
 even just a calm, easy walk,

1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:46.340
 can really adjust the ways

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:49.080
 in which blood sugar regulated for the better.

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:50.320
 I don't want to perseverate

1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:54.160
 on this processed foods, hidden sugars thing too much,

1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:56.680
 but understanding now a little bit

1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:00.320
 about how insulin and glucose work,

1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:03.020
 you can probably imagine why hidden sugars

1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:04.280
 are such an attractive thing

1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:07.120
 from the standpoint of processed food manufacturers,

1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:10.980
 because if they can put sugar in that you can't even taste,

1:05:10.980 --> 1:05:13.880
 that sugar is going to amplify the amount of glucose,

1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:16.460
 it's going to increase the rate of glucose increases

1:05:16.460 --> 1:05:17.520
 into your bloodstream,

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:19.720
 and it's going to promote more feeding.

1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:21.600
 So in that case, you're really being tricked,

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:22.960
 it's not that you're actually reaching

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:24.420
 for the additional appetizer,

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:26.160
 and your blood glucose is going up,

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:27.440
 the food that you ate

1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:30.120
 is actually increasing your appetite as you eat it,

1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:32.920
 it's a positive feedback loop.

1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:35.720
 So don't want to demonize those any more than I already have,

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:38.500
 but you should be aware that these things are happening

1:05:38.500 --> 1:05:41.000
 at the level of your bloodstream and brain.

1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:44.480
 The other thing I'd like to address for a moment

1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:47.140
 is this notion of stable blood sugar

1:05:47.140 --> 1:05:50.600
 versus labile blood sugar, or unstable blood sugar.

1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:53.520
 Some people just have stable blood sugar,

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:55.680
 they can go long periods of time without eating

1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:57.920
 and feel fine, other people get really shaky,

1:05:57.920 --> 1:06:01.480
 really jittery, and or when they do eat,

1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:04.640
 they feel really keyed up, sometimes they'll even sweat,

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:06.920
 sometimes their vision will go blurry,

1:06:06.920 --> 1:06:08.760
 and some of that can actually be

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:12.000
 because they've become hyperglycemic.

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.520
 And those effects that you experience

1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:18.240
 when you are hyperglycemic are the early warning signs

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:20.280
 of the kinds of things that damage neurons

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:22.440
 and lead to the really terrible stuff

1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:24.520
 they talked about before, like peripheral neuropathies.

1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:26.260
 Now it takes some time for those things to occur,

1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:27.760
 those neuropathies to occur,

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:30.100
 but whether or not your blood sugar is all over the place

1:06:30.100 --> 1:06:32.020
 or whether or not it's stable

1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:34.720
 can be impacted by a number of things.

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:36.840
 One of those things is exercise.

1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:38.920
 So these days there's a lot of interest

1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:40.340
 in what they call zone two cardio,

1:06:40.340 --> 1:06:42.060
 which is that kind of steady state cardio

1:06:42.060 --> 1:06:43.560
 where you can just nasal breathe,

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:45.540
 even at pretty high output,

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:47.740
 where you could maybe have a conversation,

1:06:47.740 --> 1:06:50.060
 although I'm such a huge proponent

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:51.640
 of nasal breathing during exercise,

1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:54.400
 most forms of exercise, especially zone two cardio,

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.520
 that you probably shouldn't be talking

1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:57.760
 while you're doing that cardio

1:06:57.760 --> 1:06:59.920
 unless it's absolutely essential.

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:02.920
 But periods of zone two cardio

1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:06.980
 that last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour

1:07:06.980 --> 1:07:09.140
 or sometimes more for you endurance athletes

1:07:10.140 --> 1:07:13.280
 can create positive effects on blood sugar regulation

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:17.120
 such that you, people can sit down

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:19.600
 and enjoy whatever it is, the hot fudge sundae

1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:21.900
 or whatever the high sugar content food is.

1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:24.840
 And blood glucose management is so good,

1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:28.560
 your insulin sensitivity is so high, which is a good thing,

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:30.900
 that you can manage that blood glucose

1:07:30.900 --> 1:07:33.940
 to the point where it doesn't really make you shaky,

1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:35.640
 it doesn't disrupt you.

1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:39.400
 And to say nothing of the weight related issues

1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:41.760
 or the adipose fat gain, et cetera,

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:43.900
 that's a separate issue because people vary there.

1:07:43.900 --> 1:07:47.600
 But basically doing zone two cardio

1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:50.740
 for 30 to 60 minutes three to four times a week

1:07:50.740 --> 1:07:52.880
 makes your blood sugar really stable.

1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:55.620
 And that's an attractive thing for a variety of reasons.

1:07:55.620 --> 1:07:58.680
 On the flip side, high intensity interval training

1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:01.200
 or resistance training, AKA weight training,

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:04.560
 are very good at stimulating the various molecules

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.080
 that promote repackaging of glycogen.

1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:10.900
 So sprints, heavy weightlifting, circuit type weightlifting

1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:13.680
 provided there's some reasonable degree of resistance.

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:16.080
 Those are going to trigger all sorts of mechanisms

1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:18.800
 that are going to encourage the body

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:22.060
 to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,

1:08:22.060 --> 1:08:23.760
 convert into glycogen into muscle tissue,

1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:25.640
 restock the liver, et cetera.

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:28.360
 Depleting one's glycogen actually takes some time.

1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:31.100
 If you do a couple sets of tricep extensions

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:33.440
 and some crunches, you're not depleting your glycogen.

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:37.600
 Glycogen depleting workouts are very high intensity.

1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:39.720
 Generally they're less than an hour or so,

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:42.720
 but those are the sort that are going to lead

1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:44.800
 to big increases in the kinds of enzymes

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:47.440
 and metabolic pathways that are going to repack glycogen

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:51.400
 and shuttle most things towards restorage of foods,

1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:53.440
 not into adipose tissue, not into fat,

1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:55.860
 but taking glucose and making it into fuels

1:08:55.860 --> 1:08:58.600
 that you can access later for more of that high intensity

1:08:58.600 --> 1:08:59.560
 activity.

1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:01.480
 And I should mention that one of the advantages

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:04.240
 of high intensity interval training

1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:09.120
 or weightlifting of various kinds is that it also,

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:13.280
 it causes long standing increases in basal metabolic rate.

1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:14.760
 I don't want to go too far down this path

1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:16.200
 because we're going to do an entire month

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:19.680
 on human performance and athletic performance,

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:22.680
 but it's not just the increases in muscle

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:26.560
 that increase metabolism because muscle burns more energy

1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:28.640
 than other types of tissues, except your brain,

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:31.500
 which truly burns the most energy

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:34.760
 and is the main reason why your basal metabolic rate

1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:35.640
 is what it is.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:39.680
 Well, high intensity training, so it could be sprints,

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:41.240
 it could be a high intensity interval training

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.180
 of different kinds, it could be weight training,

1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:47.240
 also has an effect of increasing thermogenesis

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:50.520
 even long after you've completed the exercise.

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:51.680
 So there's a long tail,

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:54.560
 there's a kind of post-exercise metabolic effect

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:55.880
 that's also beneficial.

1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:57.400
 So it's not an either or,

1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:59.240
 it's really that high intensity interval training

1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:01.600
 and resistance training and things of that sort

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:03.500
 are very good for one reason.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:07.080
 And the zone two cardio is very good for other reasons.

1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:09.360
 And now you can see why it's just a healthy thing

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:11.420
 and why most people should probably be doing exercise

1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:14.180
 most days of the week, if not every day of the week.

1:10:14.180 --> 1:10:17.500
 If your goal is to manage blood glucose

1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:21.080
 and your goal is to manage some of the metabolic factors

1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:23.240
 that control repackaging of glycogen

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:25.680
 and encouraging excess glucose

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.400
 to not get diverted into body fat stores.

1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:30.640
 We haven't talked a lot about lipids today.

1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:33.980
 That's because most of today's discussion is about hormones

1:10:33.980 --> 1:10:36.120
 and insulin is the dominant hormone

1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:40.000
 in terms of mobilizing and managing glucose in the body,

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.240
 at least for most people.

1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:44.400
 But fats are very important

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:47.240
 and there's just a little anecdote about fats

1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:48.480
 that I think will be useful

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:50.440
 in thinking about why you want to manage

1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:52.920
 what they call the LDL or HDL ratios.

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:54.920
 And this is deserving in an entire episode,

1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:57.220
 many perhaps even several episodes,

1:10:57.220 --> 1:11:01.540
 but some of you may be familiar with LDLs and HDLs.

1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:02.580
 Some of you may not.

1:11:02.580 --> 1:11:05.320
 The LDL is low density lipoprotein.

1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:08.140
 This is the one that you don't want it to be too high.

1:11:08.140 --> 1:11:09.020
 Costello's dreaming.

1:11:09.020 --> 1:11:09.860
 He's barking.

1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:13.060
 He doesn't, he loves all forms of cholesterol,

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.640
 but that's just Costello dreaming.

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:18.000
 So LDLs are the ones that you want to keep low.

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.960
 You don't want those to go excessively high.

1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:22.320
 HDLs, the high density lipoproteins

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:26.080
 are the ones that are the so-called healthy lipoproteins.

1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:28.600
 That's all fine and good,

1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:30.960
 but you might ask yourself, what are they doing?

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.840
 What is the actual role of these things?

1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:36.680
 And why would you want healthy levels of HDL

1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:38.460
 and not too much LDL?

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:43.460
 Well, one of the reasons is that fats don't like water.

1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:45.600
 They are hydrophobic

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:48.920
 and yet you need to move fats in your bloodstream,

1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:51.140
 all tissues in your body need fats.

1:11:51.140 --> 1:11:52.720
 They need cholesterols.

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:54.400
 Last episode, we talked about how cholesterol

1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:56.520
 is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.760
 estrogen and testosterone and other hormones as well.

1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:04.280
 Well, HDL and LDL actually coat fats

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:07.120
 to allow them to be transported through the bloodstream.

1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.000
 They do a number of other things as well,

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.260
 but HDL is a key component of the delivery system

1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:15.620
 that brings those fats to the liver,

1:12:15.620 --> 1:12:18.380
 ovaries, testes and adrenals.

1:12:18.380 --> 1:12:22.280
 In other words, having adequate levels of HDL is good

1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:24.800
 because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues

1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:29.000
 that manufacture testosterone, estrogen, cortisol

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.460
 in healthy levels and the liver.

1:12:31.460 --> 1:12:35.300
 So this is why when LDLs are too high,

1:12:35.300 --> 1:12:37.240
 what's happening is you're not getting fats

1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:39.280
 to the correct tissues and you can get buildup

1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:41.260
 of fats like fatty liver disease

1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:44.000
 and some of these things can happen.

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.600
 High sugar content can even lead

1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:47.880
 to some of these fatty liver conditions

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:48.720
 that are starting to happen.

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:51.280
 This is actually the first time in human history perhaps

1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:52.780
 that we're aware of anyway,

1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:55.360
 that we're starting to see liver conditions

1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:59.140
 that normally were associated only with severe alcoholism

1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:00.560
 starting to come from sugar content.

1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:01.560
 So what does this mean?

1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:04.120
 This means keep your LDL and HDL ratios proper.

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.840
 You want those HDLs in order to deliver fatty molecules

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.920
 to the very tissues that use cholesterol

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:13.040
 in order to manufacture hormones.

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:16.120
 So how do you keep LDLs and HDLs in their proper ratios?

1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:19.000
 Well, a lot of people don't realize this,

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.680
 but the debate about dietary cholesterol

1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.080
 and its relationship to LDL and HDL ratios

1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:28.480
 is a barbed wire debate.

1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:30.020
 I don't want to get into it right now.

1:13:30.020 --> 1:13:32.280
 There are still a lot of open questions

1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:35.120
 as to how much dietary cholesterol

1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:36.920
 impacts LDL and HDL ratios.

1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:38.880
 I don't want to get into that now.

1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:40.860
 I'm not taking a stance either way.

1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:42.520
 But what is very clear

1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:45.840
 is that having highly elevated glucose

1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:48.700
 consuming too much sugar or not managing glucose

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:50.360
 in your body through some of the mechanisms

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:52.840
 that we've been talking about up until now

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:56.560
 can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.

1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:59.140
 So managing glucose goes way beyond

1:13:59.140 --> 1:14:00.920
 just managing blood sugar

1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:03.480
 and making sure that you don't lay down too much body fat,

1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:04.920
 making sure your metabolism stays high,

1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:06.500
 making sure you're not getting jittery at meals.

1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:08.880
 It also has to do with making sure

1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:12.120
 that you're creating enough of the molecules, HDL,

1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:15.660
 and not too many of the molecules, LDL,

1:14:15.660 --> 1:14:18.640
 that are going to disrupt the delivery of things

1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:20.160
 to the organs of your body

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:21.780
 that allow you to make healthy levels

1:14:21.780 --> 1:14:24.120
 of testosterone, estrogen, and so forth.

1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:27.060
 If that wasn't clear, let me make this ultra simple.

1:14:27.060 --> 1:14:29.360
 You want healthy levels of HDL

1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:31.800
 and you want low levels of LDL

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:33.600
 because if you have ovaries,

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:38.120
 it will allow the fats that need to get to the ovary

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.780
 to produce estrogen to get there.

1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:42.080
 And if you have testes,

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:45.440
 it will allow the fats and the cholesterol molecules

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:49.640
 that you need in order to manufacture testosterone

1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:51.280
 to get to the testes.

1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:54.200
 As well, in order to have proper adrenal function

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:55.440
 and proper liver function,

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:59.200
 you want HDL and LDL in the healthy, correct levels.

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:01.880
 So now we've talked a lot about behavioral tools

1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:04.080
 and the underlying biological mechanisms

1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:07.760
 that justify those tools in particular circumstances.

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:11.040
 Now I'd like to turn to supplements and prescription drugs

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:13.500
 that regulate the hormone systems

1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:16.000
 controlling feeding and satiety.

1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:17.540
 There are a huge number of these.

1:15:17.540 --> 1:15:19.960
 Some have more powerful effects than others.

1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:21.740
 There are two that I want to describe

1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.960
 because they've been getting a lot of attention recently.

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:28.240
 First of all, there's a prescription drug metformin,

1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:30.720
 which was developed as a treatment for diabetes

1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:34.440
 and it works potently to reduce blood glucose.

1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:38.560
 It has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose.

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:43.560
 Metformin involves changes to mitochondrial action

1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:44.520
 in the liver.

1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.440
 That's its main way of depleting or reducing blood glucose.

1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:52.280
 And it does so through the so-called AMPK pathway

1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:56.840
 and it increases insulin sensitivity overall.

1:15:56.840 --> 1:15:58.720
 Metformin is a powerful drug.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.460
 In fact, I'm surprised that so many people

1:16:01.460 --> 1:16:03.200
 have sought it out,

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.040
 given that most of the people that I'm aware of

1:16:06.040 --> 1:16:07.700
 that sought it out are not diabetic.

1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:10.800
 I think for diabetics, it seems to be a useful drug.

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:12.960
 For non-diabetics, it can also,

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:14.520
 of course, lower blood glucose.

1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:17.680
 It also has the potential to make people hypoglycemic,

1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:19.520
 genuinely hypoglycemic.

1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:23.000
 So you really need to approach metformin with caution.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.360
 I get a little concerned when I hear about people

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:28.920
 blasting metformin simply because fasted states

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:31.300
 or low blood sugar states are healthy.

1:16:32.260 --> 1:16:34.880
 Doing that pharmacologically can have longstanding effects.

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:37.580
 You really want to approach that with caution.

1:16:37.580 --> 1:16:41.160
 Now there's a comparable drug.

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:42.540
 It really should be called a drug,

1:16:42.540 --> 1:16:44.200
 but it's non-prescription

1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:46.300
 that's also in fairly prominent use out there

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:51.300
 called berberine, B-E-R, B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:58.100
 So berberine is a really interesting compound.

1:16:58.100 --> 1:17:01.340
 Its actions very much mimic metformin.

1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:04.040
 So let's talk about berberine for a second.

1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:06.440
 Berberine actually comes from various plants

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:08.380
 and tree bark.

1:17:08.380 --> 1:17:10.120
 It is sold in supplement stores.

1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:11.400
 It's sold online.

1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:13.520
 It is, as far as I know, unregulated.

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:14.600
 It is powerful.

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:16.400
 If you're going to experiment with berberine,

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:18.240
 you definitely want to talk to your doctor

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.800
 and you want to approach it with caution.

1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:25.800
 It also works to activate the so-called AMPK pathway.

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:28.680
 AMPK, by the way, stands for adenosine monophosphate

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:30.880
 activated protein kinase, AMPK,

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:34.100
 and it inhibits a protein tyrosine phosphase, 1B pathway.

1:17:34.100 --> 1:17:36.460
 I think that's enough nomenclature.

1:17:36.460 --> 1:17:39.040
 It activates a certain pathway that's associated

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:41.900
 with fasting and low blood glucose.

1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:46.340
 The effects of berberine are, as far as I can tell,

1:17:46.340 --> 1:17:49.660
 when looking at the literature, are very similar,

1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:51.800
 if not identical, to metformin.

1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:56.980
 Now, the number of studies out there on this are many.

1:17:56.980 --> 1:17:58.600
 So I'm just going to review a few of them

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:00.100
 and their major effects.

1:18:00.100 --> 1:18:03.820
 As always, I invite you to check out examine.com.

1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:05.500
 It's a wonderful website where you can put in

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:08.900
 any supplement or compound or biological goal

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:11.820
 for that matter, and it will list out the various effects

1:18:11.820 --> 1:18:14.460
 in the human effect matrix, so studies on humans,

1:18:14.460 --> 1:18:17.380
 if they're available, and it will tell you

1:18:17.380 --> 1:18:18.940
 whether or not there's strong effects or weak effects

1:18:18.940 --> 1:18:20.460
 or modest effects, and it will point

1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:24.060
 to the specific subject population, a wonderful resource.

1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:27.820
 So berberine, not surprisingly, has very strong effects

1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:28.980
 in lowering blood glucose.

1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:30.900
 There are four studies on this.

1:18:30.900 --> 1:18:33.260
 In fact, they say that berberine is one of the more,

1:18:33.260 --> 1:18:35.180
 if not the most effective supplements

1:18:35.180 --> 1:18:36.380
 for lowering blood glucose.

1:18:36.380 --> 1:18:38.140
 It talks about dosages there,

1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:41.220
 although I'll just mention that I've tried berberine,

1:18:41.220 --> 1:18:44.660
 and the dosages that are typical on the bottle

1:18:44.660 --> 1:18:49.140
 of most supplements is much higher than I needed.

1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:51.860
 So when I took berberine, two things happened.

1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:55.660
 First of all, I got a pretty splitting headache.

1:18:55.660 --> 1:18:57.180
 It gave me pretty vicious headache.

1:18:57.180 --> 1:18:59.860
 So for me, it was a no, almost immediately.

1:18:59.860 --> 1:19:03.260
 The other thing is I became so hypoglycemic

1:19:03.260 --> 1:19:05.420
 that in order to get my blood sugar back up,

1:19:05.420 --> 1:19:07.540
 I think I ate something like 10 donuts,

1:19:07.540 --> 1:19:10.880
 and I didn't feel like I had ingested all that much sugar.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:11.860
 It was really kind of weird.

1:19:11.860 --> 1:19:13.180
 I was hyperphagic for sugar.

1:19:13.180 --> 1:19:14.580
 I was craving sugar, craving sugar,

1:19:14.580 --> 1:19:16.500
 and I was very thirsty as well.

1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:19.660
 And so I don't want to promote any bad behavior,

1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:21.440
 but I know that certain people use this

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:22.980
 when they've overeaten sugars

1:19:22.980 --> 1:19:24.340
 or they're doing their cheat days,

1:19:24.340 --> 1:19:26.820
 something that I'm personally just not a fan of,

1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:28.620
 and they want to keep their blood sugar in check

1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:30.220
 or they know they're going to consume a huge meal,

1:19:30.220 --> 1:19:32.960
 they'll take berberine to keep blood glucose clamped.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:34.460
 And it does do that.

1:19:34.460 --> 1:19:36.260
 It has very strong effects,

1:19:36.260 --> 1:19:39.540
 three peer-reviewed studies on HbA1c levels.

1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:42.660
 HbA1c is something that can be measured in a blood test

1:19:42.660 --> 1:19:44.900
 that is sort of an average readout

1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:46.100
 of your blood sugar levels

1:19:46.100 --> 1:19:48.100
 over the previous two or three months,

1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:49.100
 sometimes shorter period,

1:19:49.100 --> 1:19:53.680
 but that's mostly what HbA1c is about.

1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:58.500
 So it radically decreases your blood sugar levels.

1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:00.200
 It actually lowers cholesterol.

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:01.940
 It acts, remember, on the liver,

1:20:01.940 --> 1:20:06.220
 and the liver is involved in cholesterol metabolism.

1:20:06.220 --> 1:20:09.300
 And remember, it's both sugars, blood glucose,

1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:12.500
 and dietary fats, perhaps.

1:20:12.500 --> 1:20:13.860
 It's still heavily debated

1:20:14.820 --> 1:20:17.260
 in terms of how your blood total cholesterol,

1:20:17.260 --> 1:20:18.820
 HDL and LDL are regulated.

1:20:18.820 --> 1:20:20.800
 So it seems to lower total cholesterol,

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:25.360
 and it seems like it lowers HDL and LDL in parallel.

1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:27.100
 So that's interesting.

1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:29.460
 One study showed a minor increase in HDL,

1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:31.220
 the so-called good cholesterol.

1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:32.940
 Insulin levels drop, not surprising.

1:20:32.940 --> 1:20:35.740
 Another study showed a slight decrease in LDL.

1:20:35.740 --> 1:20:37.020
 Those seem to be kind of minor.

1:20:37.020 --> 1:20:38.140
 Here's a kind of interesting one,

1:20:38.140 --> 1:20:39.740
 just to help you remember berberine,

1:20:39.740 --> 1:20:41.720
 as if the fact that it comes from tree bark

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:44.740
 isn't trigger enough to remember it.

1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:48.020
 Direct contact of berberine on canker sores

1:20:48.020 --> 1:20:50.140
 seems to eliminate canker sores very quickly,

1:20:50.140 --> 1:20:51.220
 which is kind of cool.

1:20:51.220 --> 1:20:52.620
 I haven't had canker sores in a few years,

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:55.700
 but when I did get them, they are extremely painful.

1:20:55.700 --> 1:20:56.540
 Don't like those.

1:20:56.540 --> 1:20:57.460
 So that's kind of interesting,

1:20:57.460 --> 1:20:59.820
 and there's some study references there.

1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:01.660
 I find it amazing that these compounds exist.

1:21:01.660 --> 1:21:03.420
 You've got this prescription drug metformin,

1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:05.720
 and then you've got berberine, the stuff from tree bark,

1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:06.560
 and they have effects

1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:08.820
 that are essentially equivalent to one another.

1:21:08.820 --> 1:21:11.020
 So again, I'm not promoting their use

1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:13.020
 or even their exploration,

1:21:13.020 --> 1:21:14.460
 but those compounds do exist.

1:21:14.460 --> 1:21:15.480
 They're out there.

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:17.840
 And check out examine.com if you'd like to learn more.

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.840
 Certainly do your reading, do your homework

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:21.840
 before you start just popping the stuff.

1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:26.840
 And if you have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia,

1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:28.940
 be especially careful.

1:21:28.940 --> 1:21:32.460
 And also do understand that dosages

1:21:32.460 --> 1:21:33.820
 and dose requirements vary.

1:21:33.820 --> 1:21:36.500
 So if you do go down this path,

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:37.900
 really approach things carefully.

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:40.320
 Always start with the lowest amount

1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:41.800
 that you could get away with.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:44.160
 For me, the headache thing just made it a no-go.

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:47.900
 I do keep a bottle of it in full disclosure

1:21:47.900 --> 1:21:50.740
 in the odd chance that I feel like eating

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.480
 a ton of donuts.

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:55.920
 It's not so much about not ingesting the calories.

1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:57.180
 It's just that I don't like the feeling

1:21:57.180 --> 1:21:59.320
 of being hyperglycemic, the blurry vision,

1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:00.720
 just feeling lousy.

1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:02.580
 I do love donuts.

1:22:02.580 --> 1:22:04.640
 Other things that impact blood glucose

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:07.140
 in supplement form, chromium has been shown

1:22:07.140 --> 1:22:09.980
 in 29 studies to have a minor,

1:22:09.980 --> 1:22:11.380
 I want to emphasize a minor effect

1:22:11.380 --> 1:22:13.080
 on reducing blood glucose.

1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:14.240
 Things like L-carnitine,

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.260
 something we've talked about here on the podcast before

1:22:16.260 --> 1:22:19.220
 in terms of its relationship to power output

1:22:19.220 --> 1:22:23.300
 and ATP production for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise

1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:26.940
 as well as sperm quality and egg quality.

1:22:26.940 --> 1:22:28.600
 We talked about that long ago.

1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:34.700
 Things like panache ginseng can have positive effects on,

1:22:35.540 --> 1:22:37.100
 I should say can have effects

1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:39.300
 of reducing blood glucose slightly.

1:22:39.300 --> 1:22:41.740
 I don't want to give a valence to or judgment

1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:43.180
 to whether or not it's positive or negative.

1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:44.380
 Here's something that's interesting

1:22:44.380 --> 1:22:45.220
 that you should know about.

1:22:45.220 --> 1:22:49.340
 Caffeine has very reliably been shown

1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:53.440
 to increase blood glucose just a little bit, okay?

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:56.500
 So I always thought that caffeine would drop blood glucose

1:22:56.500 --> 1:23:00.380
 but it actually can increase blood glucose just slightly.

1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:03.660
 Things like magnesium, talked about magnesium

1:23:03.660 --> 1:23:07.080
 as a tool for enhancing the passage into sleep,

1:23:07.940 --> 1:23:10.740
 in particular magnesium threonate and biglycinate.

1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:13.580
 Magnesium can also have a modest reduction

1:23:13.580 --> 1:23:14.820
 on blood glucose.

1:23:14.820 --> 1:23:15.740
 You're starting to get the impression

1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:17.140
 everything reduces blood glucose

1:23:17.140 --> 1:23:18.380
 but that's certainly not the case.

1:23:18.380 --> 1:23:21.420
 And then a couple episodes ago

1:23:21.420 --> 1:23:22.460
 when we were discussing nutrition

1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:24.060
 we talked about artificial sweeteners,

1:23:24.060 --> 1:23:27.300
 sucralose, aspartame, nutra-sweet.

1:23:28.420 --> 1:23:29.700
 Some of those are generic names.

1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:31.040
 Some of those might be brand names

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.740
 and how they have negative effects on the gut microbiome

1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:35.280
 and that's supported by a number of studies.

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:40.280
 There's one artificial sweetener, it's Stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A

1:23:41.260 --> 1:23:44.060
 which seems to lower blood glucose just slightly.

1:23:44.060 --> 1:23:47.860
 And I still can't find data on whether or not

1:23:47.860 --> 1:23:52.060
 Stevia impacts the gut microbiome in either direction.

1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:53.380
 Many of the things that I consume

1:23:53.380 --> 1:23:55.020
 do have small amounts of Stevia in them.

1:23:55.020 --> 1:23:56.860
 So I'd love to know if anyone out there

1:23:56.860 --> 1:23:59.500
 is aware of quality peer-reviewed research

1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:03.420
 as to whether or not Stevia impacts the gut microbiome

1:24:03.420 --> 1:24:07.500
 similarly or differently from other artificial sweeteners.

1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:09.360
 Please let me know, please send me the references.

1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:10.200
 I'd really appreciate it.

1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:11.340
 You can put it in the comment section

1:24:11.340 --> 1:24:14.740
 on YouTube or elsewhere, comment section on YouTube

1:24:14.740 --> 1:24:16.180
 would be the best place.

1:24:16.180 --> 1:24:18.500
 So Stevia seems to lower blood glucose a little bit

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:21.560
 which makes it kind of an attractive artificial sweetener

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:24.780
 if one is going to use artificial sweeteners.

1:24:24.780 --> 1:24:28.560
 But remember sweet taste itself stimulates the desire to eat

1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:30.260
 which will increase more blood glucose.

1:24:30.260 --> 1:24:32.260
 So I'm guessing that they probably cancel each other out.

1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:35.020
 So you have to think logically about these things.

1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:37.340
 Vitamin B3, so some of the B vitamins

1:24:37.340 --> 1:24:39.260
 do indeed stimulate appetite

1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:41.460
 by triggering increases in blood glucose.

1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:44.260
 Vitamin B3 in particular, I don't know if B6 does.

1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:46.460
 Things like zinc seem to lower blood glucose.

1:24:46.460 --> 1:24:49.080
 And then there've been an enormous number of other things

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:53.460
 that have been tested for their roles in blood glucose.

1:24:53.460 --> 1:24:56.100
 Apple cider vinegar, anything acidic.

1:24:56.100 --> 1:24:59.340
 This is well-known now that any kind of acidity,

1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:01.260
 so it could be lemon juice or lime juice

1:25:01.260 --> 1:25:04.740
 or apple cider vinegar lowers blood glucose slightly.

1:25:04.740 --> 1:25:06.500
 Some of those can also have other effects

1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:08.140
 that we're not talking about today.

1:25:08.140 --> 1:25:12.220
 So that's kind of interesting because there's a movement now

1:25:12.220 --> 1:25:14.540
 towards creating sort of people talk

1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:16.140
 about becoming more alkaline.

1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:18.000
 I hate to break it to you

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.260
 but you don't really want your body to be too alkaline.

1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:23.900
 You want to stay in the right pH or else you start,

1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:26.700
 there are conditions that make you more alkaline.

1:25:26.700 --> 1:25:29.280
 You don't want to be too acidic or too alkaline.

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:33.580
 If you see a beverage or something that purports

1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:34.980
 that ingesting that beverage

1:25:34.980 --> 1:25:37.060
 is going to make you more alkaline,

1:25:37.060 --> 1:25:38.380
 that is absolutely false.

1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:39.720
 There's no evidence for that.

1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:42.860
 It's impossible biochemically, it's just marketing.

1:25:42.860 --> 1:25:47.180
 But nonetheless, ingesting foods that are acidic

1:25:47.180 --> 1:25:51.860
 can make some slight adjustments to the pH of the gut

1:25:51.860 --> 1:25:55.860
 in ways that can slow or alter the absorption of foods

1:25:55.860 --> 1:25:57.920
 and can blunt blood glucose.

1:25:57.920 --> 1:25:59.260
 You can try this sometime if you want.

1:25:59.260 --> 1:26:01.340
 If ever you're feeling kind of over sugared out

1:26:01.340 --> 1:26:03.080
 like you ate something with too much sugar,

1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:05.060
 you can drink a small amount of lemon juice

1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:06.460
 mixed with water or lime juice.

1:26:06.460 --> 1:26:08.260
 And you'll notice that it will blunt

1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:11.420
 that kind of hyperglycemic effect just a little bit.

1:26:11.420 --> 1:26:14.380
 Again, you don't want to use this as a medical tool

1:26:14.380 --> 1:26:17.180
 but the effect is fairly potent.

1:26:17.180 --> 1:26:18.860
 And then, excuse me.

1:26:18.860 --> 1:26:20.980
 And then there are a number of other things

1:26:20.980 --> 1:26:22.980
 like capsaicin and hot chili peppers

1:26:22.980 --> 1:26:24.060
 that will lower blood glucose.

1:26:24.060 --> 1:26:25.580
 The list goes on and on.

1:26:25.580 --> 1:26:30.240
 The most powerful one is absolutely berberine and metformin

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:32.960
 but that's really heavy caliber stuff.

1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:36.100
 And the other ones I mentioned have more minor effects.

1:26:36.100 --> 1:26:37.580
 I do want to mention,

1:26:37.580 --> 1:26:38.860
 because I'm sure some of you out there

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:40.340
 are curious about the ketogenic diet.

1:26:40.340 --> 1:26:42.020
 I'm going to do an entire episode

1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:44.700
 about ketosis and the brain and the body.

1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:49.700
 But the ketogenic diet has been shown in 22 studies

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:51.800
 to have a notable decrease on blood glucose.

1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:53.140
 And that is not surprising

1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:56.700
 because the essence of the ketogenic diet

1:26:56.700 --> 1:27:00.820
 is that you're consuming very little or zero of the foods

1:27:00.820 --> 1:27:04.180
 that promote big spikes in insulin and glucose.

1:27:04.180 --> 1:27:06.380
 If you consume enough protein,

1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:09.180
 some of that protein can be converted into glucose,

1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:11.140
 of course, through gluconeogenesis.

1:27:11.140 --> 1:27:14.320
 But the ketogenic diet has very strong support

1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:19.240
 for its role in regulating blood sugar, which is glucose.

1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:22.440
 But the specific effects of the ketogenic diet

1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:25.380
 and one particular effect that I'll address later

1:27:25.380 --> 1:27:26.840
 but I'll mention now,

1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:29.560
 which is the ability of the ketogenic diet

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.980
 to adjust thyroid hormone levels

1:27:32.980 --> 1:27:34.520
 in ways that make it such

1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:36.560
 that if you return to eating carbohydrates

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:38.800
 after being in ketosis for too long,

1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:41.880
 you don't manage thyroid and carbohydrates as well.

1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:43.460
 That has been shown as well.

1:27:43.460 --> 1:27:45.140
 So we're going to dive deep into ketosis

1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:46.240
 in a future episode.

1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:48.800
 So for you ketonistas out there, don't worry.

1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:51.160
 I certainly have nothing against ketogenic diet.

1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:52.920
 I actually don't have anything for

1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:54.780
 or against any particular nutrition plan.

1:27:54.780 --> 1:27:57.400
 I know it works for me, at least at this stage of my life,

1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:58.960
 and I'll update it if I need to.

1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:00.920
 I'm simply trying to get you as much information

1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:03.720
 as I possibly can so that you can navigate

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:05.320
 through that landscape in a way

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:08.520
 that's in keeping with your particular goals.

1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:10.900
 So now you understand a lot about blood sugar

1:28:10.900 --> 1:28:12.520
 and how it's managed and the ways

1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:13.940
 that you can manage it better

1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:16.400
 depending on your particular needs.

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:19.860
 This is also a good opportunity for us to look back

1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:22.020
 at some of the medical literature

1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:25.320
 because it really points to just how far we've come

1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:28.020
 in terms of understanding these important mechanisms.

1:28:28.020 --> 1:28:31.100
 And it points us in the direction of some actionable

1:28:31.100 --> 1:28:32.440
 protocols.

1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:36.200
 So diabetes, which is these huge increases

1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:40.020
 in blood glucose because there's no insulin,

1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:43.400
 was known about as early as 1500 BC,

1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:45.240
 which is just incredible.

1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:49.760
 And the way physicians then understood

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:51.940
 that certain people had high blood glucose

1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:54.400
 without actually knowing what blood glucose was

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:57.400
 is that they would take the urine of particular patients

1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:01.760
 and they'd find that ants preferably moved toward

1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:06.320
 and consumed the urine of certain patients and not others.

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:09.320
 And they understood that there was something in that urine

1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:11.440
 that was correlated with the sudden weight loss

1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:13.800
 and some of the other probably very unfortunate

1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:17.200
 health symptoms that these people were experiencing.

1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:21.080
 So they knew that there was something in blood and urine.

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:25.200
 But you might not be asking yourself, wait, that's urine.

1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:29.920
 But as I tell every kid that I meet, two things,

1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:31.920
 I tell a kid, your brain is here.

1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:33.120
 I make them point to their head.

1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:35.120
 And then I tell them, do you know what?

1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:37.900
 Do you know that your urine is actually filtered blood?

1:29:37.900 --> 1:29:40.680
 And they usually go, I get parental permission

1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:41.520
 to do this first.

1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:44.400
 But most adults don't realize that your urine

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:46.640
 is actually just filtered blood.

1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:49.660
 And that's why if you see blood in your urine,

1:29:49.660 --> 1:29:50.700
 that's a problem.

1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:54.360
 You want to filter the blood, but urine is filtered blood.

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:59.360
 Now, this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine

1:29:59.880 --> 1:30:03.000
 has been something that lasted way beyond

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:06.240
 these early stages of 1500 BC.

1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:09.280
 Turns out that as late as 1674,

1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:13.760
 physicians at Oxford University were figuring out

1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:18.400
 who had pathologically high levels of blood glucose

1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:20.840
 by analyzing their urine.

1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:23.640
 And again, they were measuring the sweetness of their urine.

1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:26.240
 But, and this is medical fact, they would do this

1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:29.220
 by taking urine samples from different patients

1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:31.280
 and tasting them.

1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:34.460
 And they developed an intuitive sense

1:30:34.460 --> 1:30:39.000
 of what excessively sweet urine was relative

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:40.720
 to the other urines that they had tasted.

1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:42.640
 So for those of you that are in the medical profession

1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:45.360
 or those of you that are seeking out the medical profession,

1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:48.040
 do understand this is not done anymore.

1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:51.320
 And you can also just reflect on how far we've come

1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:53.720
 in terms of the medical profession itself

1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:55.800
 in our ability to measure things from the blood

1:30:55.800 --> 1:30:59.920
 and measure things from urine without having to ask ants

1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:04.920
 which urine is sweeter or ask oneself which urine is sweeter

1:31:04.920 --> 1:31:08.440
 so indeed we are making progress as a species.

1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:10.620
 Before we close out today, I want to talk about

1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:14.400
 one more tool that many of you will probably find useful.

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:18.140
 I certainly have, I'm a big consumer of caffeine,

1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:20.200
 although I don't consume a ton of it,

1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:21.720
 I consume it very consistently.

1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:24.440
 So I'm big on consuming mate,

1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:27.340
 which is a strong caffeinated tea

1:31:27.340 --> 1:31:30.140
 and I generally do that early in the day.

1:31:30.140 --> 1:31:32.440
 Although I do delay about two hours after I wake up

1:31:32.440 --> 1:31:34.440
 for reasons I've talked about in previous episode

1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:37.520
 to maintain that nice arc of alertness and focus.

1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:40.520
 I do drink black coffee as well, mushroom coffee as well,

1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:41.740
 I love that stuff.

1:31:41.740 --> 1:31:45.120
 But mate, also called yerba mate,

1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:49.440
 is an interesting compound because unlike coffee,

1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:51.060
 it has been shown to increase something called

1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:56.060
 glucagon-like peptide, GLP-1 and increase leptin levels.

1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:58.600
 Now we didn't talk a lot about glucagon today.

1:31:58.600 --> 1:32:01.580
 Glucagon is really elevated in the fasting state.

1:32:01.580 --> 1:32:04.560
 I mentioned that it's sort of the opposite of insulin

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:08.940
 in kind of rough terms, that's one way to think about it.

1:32:08.940 --> 1:32:13.260
 But GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide one

1:32:13.260 --> 1:32:15.720
 is increased by ingesting mate

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:19.800
 and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppressant.

1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:22.100
 Now I'm not trying to suppress my appetite.

1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.240
 I like to eat, as I mentioned before,

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:27.920
 but it works really well to stimulate the brain

1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:31.080
 and to give you a level of alertness

1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:33.160
 and to do a lot of the things that coffee does.

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:34.920
 It also contains electrolytes.

1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:39.400
 So we, meaning our neurons and our brain

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:42.920
 run on a variety of factors, electrical activity

1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:44.280
 and chemical transmission, et cetera,

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:46.880
 but they require adequate levels of sodium,

1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:48.820
 potassium, and magnesium.

1:32:48.820 --> 1:32:51.820
 Actually, if you were to learn the biology

1:32:51.820 --> 1:32:53.600
 or the physiology of the action potential,

1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:54.920
 the firing of a neuron,

1:32:54.920 --> 1:32:57.200
 something we teach every first year neuroscience student,

1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:00.360
 and I'd be happy to teach you if you're interested,

1:33:00.360 --> 1:33:03.200
 you'll hear about sodium rushing into cells

1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:06.360
 and potassium entering and leaving cells

1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:08.720
 in order to allow neurons to communicate.

1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:11.320
 Electrolytes are critically important

1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:13.480
 for the function of the nervous system.

1:33:13.480 --> 1:33:16.440
 And many things that act as diuretics

1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:20.240
 that promote excretion of water, like caffeine,

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:22.560
 can also take electrolytes out

1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:24.360
 along with, in particular, sodium.

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:25.920
 And sometimes the lightheadedness

1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:27.960
 or the brain fog that people experience

1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:29.520
 isn't just because electrolytes are low,

1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:31.840
 but because they're kind of out of balance.

1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:36.080
 So I like mate because it has electrolytes, it has caffeine.

1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:38.760
 It stimulates the release of this glucagon-like peptide,

1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:40.980
 GLP-1, and it's been a big help to me

1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:43.640
 in extending that early morning fasting window

1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:46.580
 out to about noon or so when I eat my first meal.

1:33:46.580 --> 1:33:48.040
 It also just tastes really good.

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:49.420
 I don't drink it out of the gourd,

1:33:49.420 --> 1:33:50.840
 even though I have Argentine lineage.

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:53.820
 The gourd to me is, it's just kind of an inconvenience.

1:33:53.820 --> 1:33:55.740
 I drink it out of a mug.

1:33:55.740 --> 1:33:56.960
 There's no promotional here.

1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:00.160
 I have no relationship to any yerba mate plantations

1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:01.960
 or companies.

1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:03.760
 I just happen to really like the stuff.

1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:08.560
 And the fact that glucagon-like peptide-1 is enriched

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:11.520
 or is released more when you drink mate,

1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:15.020
 and the fact that GLP-1 can regulate blood sugar

1:34:15.020 --> 1:34:17.280
 in ways that keep your blood sugar

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:20.160
 in that we called you got glycemic,

1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:22.200
 not too high, not too low mode

1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:26.040
 is one reason why ingesting mate is attractive to me.

1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:27.800
 If you go to South America,

1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:30.160
 what you'll see, especially among Uruguayans,

1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:32.640
 but also Argentines is people actually carry a thermos

1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:34.680
 of this stuff with them around

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:36.560
 and bring it to meals in restaurants.

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:38.380
 And that's just considered cultural convention.

1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:40.100
 It's not unusual to see that.

1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:41.940
 So we don't see that so much here in the States,

1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:43.520
 but I happen to really love this stuff.

1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:45.100
 I brew my own

1:34:45.100 --> 1:34:47.100
 because that's the most economical way to do it.

1:34:47.100 --> 1:34:48.520
 And I really enjoy it.

1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:50.960
 It can be a little bitter for some people.

1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:53.200
 The real key there, if you want to know the mate trick

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:55.860
 is to not use water that's really boiling hot.

1:34:55.860 --> 1:34:57.200
 You go just shy of boil

1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:01.980
 and then it doesn't have that same kind of tobacco-like

1:35:01.980 --> 1:35:04.720
 or really acidic flavor to it.

1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:07.040
 It's a little bit, just a little bit sweeter,

1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:08.580
 although not quite sweet.

1:35:08.580 --> 1:35:13.120
 So Yerba Mate GLP-1 can manage in healthy ways,

1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:16.200
 leptin levels, glucose levels, and glucagon levels

1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:19.720
 in ways that if it serves you, you might want to try.

1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:23.200
 So once again, we covered an enormous amount of material

1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.300
 focused on how hormones regulate feeding, hunger,

1:35:27.300 --> 1:35:30.280
 and when one feels they don't need to eat,

1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:33.040
 so-called satiety that you've had enough.

1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:35.000
 As always, we covered a lot,

1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.680
 but I could not be exhaustive about all the information

1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:39.880
 related to this topic.

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.080
 It's just so vast.

1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:43.920
 For instance, we did not talk about thyroid hormone,

1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.020
 an extremely important hormone and pathway

1:35:47.020 --> 1:35:48.360
 in the body and brain.

1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:50.640
 We are going to do an episode related to thyroid

1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:53.100
 and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise.

1:35:53.100 --> 1:35:54.640
 Having seen this episode,

1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:58.820
 you will be able to digest that material with far more ease.

1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:01.240
 We also didn't talk about the fact

1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:04.960
 that testosterone and estrogen can impact blood glucose

1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:07.200
 in ways that are opposite to one another,

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:09.200
 that when estrogen levels are high,

1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:11.640
 appetite tends to be reduced.

1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:13.680
 When testosterone levels are high,

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.120
 appetite tends to increase.

1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:17.220
 So there are all sorts of interesting interplays

1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:18.720
 between the various hormones,

1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:21.660
 but that's much too much of a deep dive for now.

1:36:21.660 --> 1:36:24.440
 Right now, we've just focused today mainly

1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:26.200
 on things like ghrelin,

1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:29.280
 on things like melanocyte-simulating hormone,

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:32.960
 incredible, powerful hormone that can suppress appetite,

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.560
 on things like cholecystokinin that comes from the gut

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.280
 and can suppress appetite,

1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:40.520
 on things like food emulsifiers,

1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.560
 on the fact that when you're eating,

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:44.720
 you are amino acid seeking,

1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:46.380
 even though you might not realize it,

1:36:46.380 --> 1:36:49.560
 that you are also seeking out particular fatty acids,

1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:53.400
 in particular, the conjugated linoleic acids and omega-3s.

1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:55.840
 So I've tried to give you a number of actionable tools.

1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:58.720
 Many of them are behavioral.

1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:00.960
 Some of them are based on supplements

1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:02.500
 or even prescription drugs.

1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:04.560
 Again, always do what's best for your health

1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:07.560
 and do that in company with a healthcare professional.

1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:08.400
 I'm not a physician.

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:09.840
 I don't prescribe anything.

1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:11.160
 I'm a professor.

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:12.420
 I profess a lot of things.

1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:13.880
 And I try and share with you what I think

1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:16.680
 to be the best high quality peer-reviewed literature.

1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:18.200
 So that's what I've done today.

1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:20.400
 Really appreciate your time and attention.

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:21.920
 Many of you have continued to ask

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:23.800
 how you can help support the podcast,

1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:26.080
 and we really appreciate the question.

1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:27.320
 There are several ways to do that.

1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:31.000
 The first is to like a video that you've seen

1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:32.120
 if you like it,

1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:34.360
 and please subscribe to the YouTube channel.

1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:35.740
 That's perhaps the most important thing

1:37:35.740 --> 1:37:37.080
 about the YouTube channel.

1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:38.540
 As well, leave us a comment.

1:37:38.540 --> 1:37:40.220
 If you leave us a comment in the comment section,

1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:41.300
 that helps us.

1:37:41.300 --> 1:37:43.120
 And please ask questions.

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:45.920
 Those questions and your comments do inform content

1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:46.900
 of future episodes.

1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:48.000
 We read them all.

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:49.420
 Except the negative ones, we don't read.

1:37:49.420 --> 1:37:50.260
 I'm just kidding.

1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:51.600
 We read them all.

1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:55.960
 In addition, please subscribe on Apple and or Spotify

1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:57.500
 or both if you like.

1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:59.260
 And on Apple, you have the opportunity

1:37:59.260 --> 1:38:01.160
 to leave us up to a five-star review

1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:02.400
 if you feel we deserve that.

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:04.520
 Apple also lets you leave a comment,

1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:06.760
 some feedback for us as well.

1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:08.220
 Please do check out our sponsors

1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:10.920
 that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:13.460
 That's the best way perhaps to support the podcast.

1:38:13.460 --> 1:38:15.240
 As well, we have a Patreon account.

1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:18.000
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:19.700
 and there you can support the podcast

1:38:19.700 --> 1:38:21.440
 at any level you like.

1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:24.640
 And today, as well as in previous episodes,

1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:26.380
 I've mentioned various supplements.

1:38:26.380 --> 1:38:28.600
 If you're interested in seeing what supplements I take

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.600
 and you want to explore for some other supplements as well,

1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:36.600
 you can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash U,

1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:38.940
 the letter U, slash Huberman.

1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:42.060
 Thorne is a supplement company that we believe

1:38:42.060 --> 1:38:45.300
 to have the highest stringency in terms of what they put

1:38:45.300 --> 1:38:47.420
 in the various supplements that they make

1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:49.400
 and the amounts that they put are very accurate.

1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:51.480
 They've partnered with the Mayo Clinic.

1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:53.600
 They've partnered with all the major sports teams

1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:56.080
 and we've partnered with them because we believe

1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:58.840
 in their levels of stringency and accuracy.

1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:03.840
 If you go to Thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:06.380
 you can see what I take and you'll also get 20% off

1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.020
 any of those supplements or any of the other supplements

1:39:09.020 --> 1:39:10.220
 that Thorne makes.

1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:13.120
 So that's where you can find out more about supplements

1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:14.280
 and the ones that I take.

1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:17.480
 And again, you get the 20% discount on any supplements

1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:18.800
 that Thorne makes.

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:21.680
 And last but not least, thank you for being with us.

1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:22.840
 I hope you learned a lot.

1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:25.380
 I hope you explore some of the tools

1:39:25.380 --> 1:39:27.840
 and that the mechanistic information that you learned today

1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:28.960
 will serve you well.

1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:31.360
 If you know anyone that's interested in this topic

1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:33.440
 or you think that someone could benefit from it,

1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:35.580
 please suggest the podcast to them as well.

1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:38.320
 And most of all, thank you for your interest in science.

1:39:38.320 --> 1:40:06.320
 And I'll see you in the next one.
