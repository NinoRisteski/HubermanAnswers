00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.060
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.060 --> 00:12.620
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.620 --> 00:14.500
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.860
 Today, we are going to discuss the gut and the brain,

00:17.860 --> 00:19.020
 and we are going to discuss

00:19.020 --> 00:21.500
 how your gut influences your brain

00:21.500 --> 00:24.140
 and your brain influences your gut.

00:24.140 --> 00:25.860
 As many of you probably know,

00:25.860 --> 00:28.640
 there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling,

00:28.640 --> 00:31.460
 which tends to be something that you seem to know

00:31.460 --> 00:33.900
 without really knowing how you know it.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.920
 That's one version of the gut feeling.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.020
 The other is that you sense something

00:38.020 --> 00:41.220
 in your actual gut, in your body,

00:41.220 --> 00:45.580
 and that that somehow drives you to think or feel or act

00:45.580 --> 00:48.120
 in a particular way, maybe to move towards something

00:48.120 --> 00:50.280
 or to move away from something.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.180
 Now, today, we aren't going to focus so much

00:52.180 --> 00:54.860
 on the psychology of gut feelings,

00:54.860 --> 00:57.280
 but on the biology of gut feelings

00:57.280 --> 00:59.100
 and how the gut and brain interact,

00:59.100 --> 01:01.580
 because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain

01:01.580 --> 01:05.100
 both directly by way of neurons, nerve cells,

01:05.100 --> 01:08.340
 and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body,

01:08.340 --> 01:09.980
 which permeates up to your brain

01:09.980 --> 01:12.940
 and impacts various aspects of brain function.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.820
 But it works in the other direction too.

01:14.820 --> 01:18.020
 Your brain is influencing your entire gut.

01:18.020 --> 01:20.280
 And when I say entire gut, I don't just mean your stomach,

01:20.280 --> 01:22.420
 I mean your entire digestive tract.

01:22.420 --> 01:23.740
 Your brain is impacting things

01:23.740 --> 01:26.260
 like how quickly your food is digesting,

01:26.260 --> 01:28.020
 the chemistry of your gut.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.360
 If you happen to be stressed or not stressed,

01:30.360 --> 01:33.640
 whether or not you are under a particular social challenge

01:33.640 --> 01:35.260
 or whether or not you're particularly happy

01:35.260 --> 01:38.020
 will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut

01:38.020 --> 01:40.300
 and the chemistry of your gut in turn

01:40.300 --> 01:42.740
 will change the way that your brain works.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.220
 I'll put all that together for you

01:44.220 --> 01:47.180
 in the context of what we call the gut microbiome.

01:47.180 --> 01:50.820
 The gut microbiome are the trillions of little bacteria

01:50.820 --> 01:54.060
 that live all the way along your digestive tract

01:54.060 --> 01:57.820
 and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works

01:57.820 --> 02:00.340
 at the level of metabolism, immune system,

02:00.340 --> 02:01.740
 and brain function.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.680
 And of course, we will discuss tools,

02:03.680 --> 02:06.400
 things that you can do in order to maintain

02:06.400 --> 02:08.460
 or improve your gut health.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.660
 Because as you'll also soon see,

02:10.660 --> 02:13.080
 gut health is immensely important

02:13.080 --> 02:15.560
 for all aspects of our wellbeing,

02:15.560 --> 02:18.500
 at the level of our brain, at the level of our body.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.240
 And there are simple actionable things that we can all do

02:21.240 --> 02:23.740
 in order to optimize our gut health

02:23.740 --> 02:26.940
 in ways that optimize our overall nervous system functioning.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.780
 So we will be sure to review those today.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.340
 This episode also serves as a bit of a primer

02:32.340 --> 02:34.980
 for our guest episode that's coming up next week

02:34.980 --> 02:38.300
 with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg from Stanford University.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.420
 Dr. Sonnenberg is a world expert in the gut microbiome

02:42.420 --> 02:45.780
 and so we will dive really deep into the gut microbiome

02:45.780 --> 02:47.500
 in all its complexity.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.980
 We'll make it all very simple for you.

02:48.980 --> 02:51.740
 We will also talk about actionable tools in that episode.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.740
 This episode is a standalone episode,

02:53.740 --> 02:55.820
 so you'll get a lot of information and tools,

02:55.820 --> 02:58.340
 but if you have the opportunity to see this episode first,

02:58.340 --> 03:00.180
 I think it will serve as a nice primer

03:00.180 --> 03:02.860
 for the conversation with Dr. Sonnenberg.

03:02.860 --> 03:04.620
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

03:04.620 --> 03:05.940
 that this podcast is separate

03:05.940 --> 03:08.220
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.260
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:10.260 --> 03:12.900
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:12.900 --> 03:15.740
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:15.740 --> 03:16.860
 In keeping with that theme,

03:16.860 --> 03:19.740
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.960
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.560
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:23.560 --> 03:26.060
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.500
 I've been using Athletic Greens,

03:27.500 --> 03:30.820
 which is now called AG1, since 2012,

03:30.820 --> 03:33.460
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.260
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

03:35.260 --> 03:36.820
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

03:36.820 --> 03:38.780
 once or twice a day is that it covers

03:38.780 --> 03:41.260
 all of my foundational vitamin and mineral needs

03:41.260 --> 03:44.680
 and also because it contains high quality probiotics

03:44.680 --> 03:46.900
 and prebiotics, which is a topic

03:46.900 --> 03:48.680
 that we're going to talk a lot about today.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.300
 With Athletic Greens, I can be sure

03:50.300 --> 03:52.900
 that I'm getting all the vitamins and minerals that I need,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.980
 so if I'm missing anything in my diet,

03:54.980 --> 03:57.540
 I can compensate for that with the Athletic Greens.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.320
 Plus, it has the probiotics and prebiotics

04:00.320 --> 04:02.500
 that can also compensate for any deficiencies

04:02.500 --> 04:05.460
 that I might have in creating the right environment

04:05.460 --> 04:07.060
 for my gut microbiome.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.400
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

04:08.400 --> 04:11.340
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:11.340 --> 04:12.700
 to claim a special offer.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.240
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

04:14.240 --> 04:16.720
 which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

04:16.720 --> 04:18.180
 while you're in the car or on a plane

04:18.180 --> 04:19.460
 or otherwise on the move,

04:19.460 --> 04:22.700
 and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.220
 While not everyone needs additional vitamin D3,

04:25.220 --> 04:28.180
 many people do, even if they're getting sufficient sunlight.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.820
 So you get the year supply of vitamin D3

04:29.820 --> 04:31.060
 and it also has K2 in there.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.100
 K2 has been shown to be important for various aspects

04:34.100 --> 04:37.020
 of calcium regulation, cardiovascular health, and so on.

04:37.020 --> 04:39.700

04:41.200 --> 04:44.180
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

04:44.180 --> 04:47.180
 Element is an electrolyte drink that contains no sugar.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.180
 It does, however, contain sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

04:51.180 --> 04:54.020
 I've talked about sodium on the podcast before.

04:54.020 --> 04:57.740
 I think sodium can indeed be problematic for some people

04:57.740 --> 04:59.900
 with hypertension or pre-hypertension,

04:59.900 --> 05:03.020
 but for many people, sodium is a great thing.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.140
 It can increase blood volume

05:04.140 --> 05:05.700
 in ways that can be helpful to them.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.540
 It can improve nerve cell function

05:07.540 --> 05:09.140
 in ways that can be helpful to them.

05:09.140 --> 05:12.580
 And for me, anytime I'm exercising and sweating a lot,

05:12.580 --> 05:13.980
 I want to replace my electrolytes,

05:13.980 --> 05:15.460
 and that means replacing sodium

05:15.460 --> 05:19.060
 for adequate neuron function, muscle function, and so on.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.700
 Element is formulated to help anyone

05:20.700 --> 05:22.060
 with their electrolyte needs

05:22.060 --> 05:23.580
 and is perfectly suited for people

05:23.580 --> 05:25.220
 who are following a ketogenic,

05:25.220 --> 05:27.840
 low carbohydrate, or paleo diet.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.300
 Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio

05:30.300 --> 05:32.660
 of 1,000 milligrams of sodium,

05:32.660 --> 05:34.140
 200 milligrams of potassium,

05:34.140 --> 05:36.420
 and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.580
 If you'd like to try Element,

05:37.580 --> 05:40.680
 you can go to drinkelement.com slash Huberman

05:40.680 --> 05:42.620
 to claim a free Element sample pack.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.280
 You only pay the cost of shipping.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.280

05:48.960 --> 05:51.900
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.300
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

05:54.300 --> 05:56.920
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

05:56.920 --> 05:58.500
 to help you better understand your body

05:58.500 --> 06:00.540
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.460
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

06:03.460 --> 06:05.640
 for the simple reason that many of the things

06:05.640 --> 06:07.700
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:07.700 --> 06:10.300
 can only be assessed with a quality blood test.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.160
 And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,

06:13.160 --> 06:15.420
 you can also get insights into, for instance,

06:15.420 --> 06:17.580
 what your biological age is

06:17.580 --> 06:20.220
 and how that compares to your chronological age.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.500
 Now, one of the major problems

06:21.500 --> 06:23.840
 with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there

06:23.840 --> 06:25.280
 is that you get numbers back.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.820
 They'll tell you if those numbers are in range

06:26.820 --> 06:28.780
 and out of range, but they don't tell you anything

06:28.780 --> 06:30.800
 about what to do with that information.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.300
 With Inside Tracker, they make everything very simple

06:33.300 --> 06:35.780
 in terms of directing you towards particular protocols.

06:35.780 --> 06:37.740
 So these could be nutrition protocols,

06:37.740 --> 06:39.300
 supplementation protocols,

06:39.300 --> 06:41.260
 or lifestyle behavioral protocols

06:41.260 --> 06:43.680
 to help you bring those numbers into the ranges

06:43.680 --> 06:45.220
 that are best for you.

06:45.220 --> 06:46.660
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

06:46.660 --> 06:49.260
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

06:49.260 --> 06:52.080

06:52.080 --> 06:55.940
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.360
 Okay, let's talk about the gut and the brain

06:58.360 --> 06:59.740
 and how your gut and your brain

06:59.740 --> 07:02.100
 communicate in both directions.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.620
 Because as I mentioned before,

07:03.620 --> 07:07.300
 your gut is communicating all the time with your brain

07:07.300 --> 07:10.380
 and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut.

07:10.380 --> 07:14.060
 And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another

07:14.060 --> 07:17.180
 that ordinarily is below your conscious detection.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.340
 Although you're probably familiar with the experience

07:19.340 --> 07:21.700
 of every once in a while getting a stomach ache

07:21.700 --> 07:23.740
 or of eating something that doesn't agree with you

07:23.740 --> 07:25.420
 or conversely eating something

07:25.420 --> 07:27.840
 that you find particularly delicious.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.800
 And that sensation or that experience rather

07:30.800 --> 07:32.760
 being a whole body experience.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.740
 Your mind is excited about what you're eating or just ate.

07:35.740 --> 07:39.140
 Your gut is excited about what you're eating or just ate.

07:39.140 --> 07:42.020
 And it seems to be a kind of unified perception

07:42.020 --> 07:44.100
 of both brain and body.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.260
 Today, we're going to talk about how that comes about

07:46.260 --> 07:47.640
 in the negative sense.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.520
 Like, you know, when you meet someone you really dislike

07:50.520 --> 07:52.860
 or when you have a stomach ache and in the positive sense,

07:52.860 --> 07:54.940
 when you interact with somebody that you really, really like

07:54.940 --> 07:57.140
 and you'd like to spend more time with them, for instance,

07:57.140 --> 07:59.900
 or when you eat something that you really, really like

07:59.900 --> 08:01.820
 and you'd like to spend more time with that food,

08:01.820 --> 08:03.060
 so to speak.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.580
 Now, the gut and the brain represent

08:05.580 --> 08:08.180
 what we call a biological circuit.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.860
 Meaning they include different stations.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.580
 So station A communicates with station B,

08:13.580 --> 08:16.220
 which communicates with station C and so on.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.500
 And as I mentioned earlier, it is bi-directional.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.260
 It's a two way street between gut and brain.

08:21.260 --> 08:24.000
 I want to make the important point at the outset

08:24.000 --> 08:27.420
 that when I say the word gut, when I refer to the gut,

08:27.420 --> 08:30.480
 I'm not just referring to the stomach.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.700
 Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach

08:33.700 --> 08:36.960
 because we think of having a gut or not having a gut

08:36.960 --> 08:39.740
 or having a gut feeling of some sort.

08:39.740 --> 08:43.200
 But in the context of gut brain signaling

08:43.200 --> 08:45.780
 and the related microbiome,

08:45.780 --> 08:49.500
 the gut includes the entire digestive tract.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.240
 That's right, from start to finish,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.060
 the entire digestive tract.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.740
 So much so that today we're going to talk about,

08:55.740 --> 08:58.800
 for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.420
 that reside in your gut,

09:00.420 --> 09:03.620
 that communicate to specific locations in the brain

09:03.620 --> 09:06.260
 and cause the release of specific neurochemicals,

09:06.260 --> 09:09.480
 such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin,

09:09.480 --> 09:12.760
 that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food

09:12.760 --> 09:14.980
 or type of interaction or behavior,

09:14.980 --> 09:18.520
 or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.580
 And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact,

09:21.580 --> 09:24.660
 reside in your intestines, not in your stomach.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.540
 They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine.

09:27.540 --> 09:31.120
 In fact, you actually have taste receptors and neurons

09:31.120 --> 09:33.780
 located all along your digestive tract.

09:33.780 --> 09:36.420
 You have neurons that are located all along your digestive

09:36.420 --> 09:39.420
 tract, and they are communicating to your brain

09:39.420 --> 09:42.780
 to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.300
 Okay, so for the gut brain axis,

09:44.300 --> 09:45.900
 we need to deal with the brain part,

09:45.900 --> 09:48.040
 and then we need to deal with the gut part.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.840
 Let's just quickly talk about the brain part,

09:49.840 --> 09:53.580
 because there, the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer,

09:53.580 --> 09:55.900
 in that when we say the gut brain axis,

09:55.900 --> 09:57.180
 it does include the brain,

09:57.180 --> 10:00.280
 but includes a lot of other things as well.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.660
 So as many of you probably know by now,

10:02.660 --> 10:04.780
 if you're listeners of this podcast, and if you don't,

10:04.780 --> 10:06.020
 that's fine.

10:06.020 --> 10:09.820
 Your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal

10:09.820 --> 10:11.980
 cord, and those together constitute what's called

10:11.980 --> 10:13.380
 the central nervous system.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.860
 Your neural retinas, which are the lining the back

10:17.860 --> 10:22.340
 of your eyes and are the light sensing portion of your eyes

10:22.340 --> 10:25.680
 are also part of your central nervous system.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.780
 So actually your eyes are part of your brain.

10:27.780 --> 10:29.600
 They're the only parts of your brain that are outside

10:29.600 --> 10:30.960
 the cranial vault.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.020
 So your retinas, your brain proper,

10:34.020 --> 10:36.580
 and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.580
 The other parts of your nervous system constitute what's

10:38.580 --> 10:40.960
 called the peripheral nervous system,

10:40.960 --> 10:43.240
 which are the components of your nervous system that reside

10:43.240 --> 10:46.620
 outside the retinas, brain, and spinal cord.

10:46.620 --> 10:48.660
 Now, this is very important because today we're going to

10:48.660 --> 10:52.100
 talk a lot about how the gut communicates with the brain.

10:52.100 --> 10:56.220
 And it does that by way of peripheral nervous system

10:56.220 --> 10:59.460
 components, meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut

10:59.460 --> 11:03.220
 and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain

11:03.220 --> 11:06.800
 and cross into the central nervous system to influence

11:06.800 --> 11:08.760
 what you think and what you feel.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.260
 So that's the nervous system part of what we call

11:11.260 --> 11:13.340
 the gut brain axis.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.460
 Brain, again, just being a shorthand for including

11:15.460 --> 11:17.820
 all the elements I just described.

11:17.820 --> 11:20.120
 Gut, as you now know, includes all the elements

11:20.120 --> 11:21.520
 of the digestive tract.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.620
 Let's talk about the architecture or the structure

11:24.620 --> 11:27.820
 of the gut of your digestive system.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.420
 Not surprisingly, your digestive system,

11:30.420 --> 11:34.100
 AKA your gut, begins at your mouth and ends at your anus.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.960
 And all along its length, there are a series of sphincters

11:37.960 --> 11:41.300
 that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract

11:41.300 --> 11:43.460
 from the other chambers.

11:43.460 --> 11:47.900
 Now, also along this tube that we call the digestive tract,

11:47.900 --> 11:52.100
 there's great variation in the degree of acidity or pH,

11:52.100 --> 11:53.420
 as it's sometimes called.

11:53.420 --> 11:57.960
 That variation in acidity turns out to give rise

11:57.960 --> 12:00.540
 to different little micro environments

12:00.540 --> 12:04.300
 in which particular microbiota, micro bacteria,

12:04.300 --> 12:07.620
 can thrive or fail to thrive.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.220
 And so the way I'd like you to think about

12:09.220 --> 12:11.980
 the digestive tract, this gut component

12:11.980 --> 12:15.620
 of the gut brain axis, is that it's not just one component.

12:15.620 --> 12:18.420
 It's not just your stomach with a particular acidity

12:18.420 --> 12:22.400
 and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well

12:22.400 --> 12:23.540
 to make you feel good

12:23.540 --> 12:27.060
 and make your digestive pathways work well.

12:27.060 --> 12:30.340
 It's a series of chambers, little micro environments

12:30.340 --> 12:33.280
 in which particular microbiota thrive

12:33.280 --> 12:35.740
 and other microbiota do not.

12:35.740 --> 12:38.580
 And certain behaviors that you undertake

12:38.580 --> 12:40.620
 and certain experiences that you have

12:40.620 --> 12:43.080
 will adjust those micro environments

12:43.080 --> 12:46.600
 in ways that make particular microbiota, certain bacteria,

12:46.600 --> 12:50.020
 more likely to thrive and others less likely to thrive.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.860
 We'll talk about how that was set up for you

12:51.860 --> 12:53.180
 early in life.

12:53.180 --> 12:55.340
 Actually from the moment that you came into the world,

12:55.340 --> 12:57.700
 that microbiome was being established.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.700
 It was actually strongly impacted,

13:00.700 --> 13:02.860
 depending on whether or not you were born by C-section

13:02.860 --> 13:04.960
 or by vaginal birth.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.920
 And it was strongly impacted by who handled you

13:07.920 --> 13:08.860
 when you came into the world.

13:08.860 --> 13:10.780
 Literally the hands that were on you,

13:10.780 --> 13:12.560
 how much skin contact you had,

13:12.560 --> 13:14.860
 whether or not you were a preemie baby or not,

13:14.860 --> 13:16.180
 whether or not you had pets at home,

13:16.180 --> 13:17.820
 whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt,

13:17.820 --> 13:19.260
 whether or not you were allowed to eat snails

13:19.260 --> 13:20.460
 or whether or not you were kept

13:20.460 --> 13:22.380
 in a very antiseptic environment.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.540
 All of those experiences shaped

13:24.540 --> 13:26.180
 these little micro environments

13:26.180 --> 13:28.980
 and shaped what constitutes best or worst

13:28.980 --> 13:30.860
 for those micro environments.

13:30.860 --> 13:34.240
 So you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract

13:34.240 --> 13:36.380
 and it's very, very long.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.580
 In fact, if we were to splay it out,

13:38.580 --> 13:40.860
 we were to take all the curves and turns

13:40.860 --> 13:43.900
 out of the intestine, we would find that it is very long.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.900
 It's approximately nine meters long.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.660
 Now the structure of that digestive tract

13:48.660 --> 13:50.280
 turns out to be very important

13:50.280 --> 13:52.260
 in terms of gut brain signaling.

13:53.580 --> 13:56.060
 Once again, it's a tube and the hollow of that tube

13:56.060 --> 13:59.180
 is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.

13:59.180 --> 14:02.420
 But the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth,

14:02.420 --> 14:04.440
 at least not for significant portions

14:04.440 --> 14:06.120
 of the digestive tract.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.000
 For much of the digestive tract,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.780
 there are bumps and grooves that look very much

14:11.780 --> 14:13.100
 like the folds in the brain,

14:13.100 --> 14:15.960
 but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.940
 They're made up of what's called a mucosal lining.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.060
 So there's a lot of mucus there.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.360
 And if we were to look really closely,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.500
 what we'd find is that there are little hairy

14:24.500 --> 14:29.020
 like cellular processes that we call microvilli

14:29.020 --> 14:32.620
 that are able to push things along the digestive tract.

14:34.260 --> 14:38.100
 The microbiota reside everywhere along the lumen

14:38.100 --> 14:41.160
 of the digestive tract, starting at the mouth

14:41.160 --> 14:43.000
 and all the way to the other end.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.820
 And they reside within those microvilli

14:45.820 --> 14:48.100
 and they reside within the lumen.

14:48.100 --> 14:51.100
 And if we were to look really closely

14:51.100 --> 14:54.300
 at the bumps and grooves along the digestive tract,

14:54.300 --> 14:56.980
 what we would find is that there are little niches,

14:56.980 --> 14:59.900
 little areas in which particular things

14:59.900 --> 15:02.420
 can grow and reside best.

15:02.420 --> 15:03.640
 Now that might sound kind of gross,

15:03.640 --> 15:05.300
 but it actually is a good thing,

15:05.300 --> 15:08.060
 especially if what's growing and residing there

15:08.060 --> 15:12.500
 are micro-bacterial organisms that are good for your gut

15:12.500 --> 15:14.260
 and that signal good things to your brain.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.420
 And we will talk about what that signaling looks like

15:16.420 --> 15:19.220
 and how that's done and accomplished in just a few moments.

15:19.220 --> 15:22.280
 But I want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut,

15:22.280 --> 15:23.940
 something that we don't often see.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.540
 And often when we think about the gut,

15:25.540 --> 15:27.780
 again, we just think about the hollow of the stomach,

15:27.780 --> 15:29.780
 food going in there and getting digested,

15:29.780 --> 15:31.100
 but it's far more complex

15:31.100 --> 15:33.140
 and actually far more interesting than that.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.340
 Now I've been referring to the gut microbiome

15:35.340 --> 15:38.300
 and to the microbiota and these bacteria.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.780
 Let me define those terms a little bit more specifically

15:40.780 --> 15:42.620
 just to avoid any confusion.

15:42.620 --> 15:46.900
 The microbiota are the actual bacteria.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.140
 The microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria,

15:50.140 --> 15:52.780
 but also all the genes that those bacteria make,

15:52.780 --> 15:54.680
 because it turns out that they make some important genes

15:54.680 --> 15:56.600
 that actually impact all of us.

15:58.420 --> 16:01.840
 You have loads and loads of these little microbiota,

16:01.840 --> 16:03.360
 these bacteria.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.020
 In fact, right now you are carrying with you

16:06.020 --> 16:08.180
 about two to three kilograms.

16:08.180 --> 16:11.760
 So that's more than six pounds of these microbiota,

16:11.760 --> 16:13.080
 these bacteria.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.880
 And if we were to look at them under a microscope,

16:14.880 --> 16:17.480
 what we would see is these are relatively simple

16:17.480 --> 16:19.820
 little organisms, some remain stationary.

16:19.820 --> 16:22.920
 So they might plop down into the mucosal lining,

16:22.920 --> 16:25.400
 or they might hang out on a particular microvilli,

16:25.400 --> 16:28.120
 or they might be in one of those little niches

16:28.120 --> 16:30.120
 and others can move about.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.960
 But they basically fill the entire lumen,

16:32.960 --> 16:37.320
 they surround and kind of coat the surface of the microvilli

16:37.320 --> 16:40.660
 and they're tucked up into any of those little niches

16:40.660 --> 16:43.180
 that are available to them to tuck into.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.800
 If you were to take the head of a pin

16:46.800 --> 16:49.160
 and look at it under the microscope,

16:49.160 --> 16:53.240
 you could fit many, many hundreds, if not thousands or more

16:53.240 --> 16:55.480
 of these little microbacteria.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.400
 And the reason I say many, many thousands or more,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.240
 I'm giving a kind of broad range there,

17:00.240 --> 17:02.080
 is that they do vary in size.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.840
 And again, they vary as to whether or not they can move

17:03.840 --> 17:05.580
 or they don't move.

17:05.580 --> 17:08.040
 Now they're constantly turning over in your gut,

17:08.040 --> 17:10.640
 meaning they're being born, so to speak,

17:10.640 --> 17:12.640
 and they're dying off.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.640
 And some will stay there for very long periods of time

17:15.640 --> 17:18.080
 within your gut and others will get excreted.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.920
 About 60% of your stool,

17:20.920 --> 17:23.480
 as unpleasant as that might be to think about,

17:23.480 --> 17:27.700
 is made up of live and dead microbacteria.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.160
 So you're constantly making

17:29.160 --> 17:32.220
 and excreting these microbacteria.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.320
 And which microbacteria you make

17:35.320 --> 17:39.640
 and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave,

17:39.640 --> 17:41.180
 meaning how many are excreted,

17:42.180 --> 17:45.280
 depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut

17:45.280 --> 17:48.720
 and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat

17:48.720 --> 17:50.880
 and the foods that you do not eat.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.440
 Now, just because what we eat strongly influences

17:53.440 --> 17:56.940
 our microbiome, meaning our microbacteria,

17:56.940 --> 18:00.440
 does not mean that there are not other influences

18:00.440 --> 18:02.860
 on what constitutes our microbiome.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.440
 Our microbiome is also made up by microbacteria

18:07.440 --> 18:10.000
 that access our digestive tract through our mouth,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.800
 through breathing, through kissing,

18:13.800 --> 18:16.080
 and through skin contact.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.660
 In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome

18:19.660 --> 18:21.620
 is who we interact with

18:21.620 --> 18:24.040
 and the environment that we happen to be in.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.180
 And that actually includes

18:25.180 --> 18:27.800
 whether or not we interact with animals.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.120
 In a little bit, I'll talk about some data

18:30.120 --> 18:33.320
 as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals,

18:33.320 --> 18:34.480
 whether or not you grew up in the home,

18:34.480 --> 18:36.360
 whether or not there was a lot of social contact,

18:36.360 --> 18:38.040
 meaning skin contact,

18:38.040 --> 18:39.400
 or whether or not you grew up

18:39.400 --> 18:43.600
 in a more animal-sparse, contact-sparse environment

18:43.600 --> 18:45.760
 and how that shapes your microbiome.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.320
 But the simple point is

18:47.320 --> 18:49.640
 that what you eat influences your microbiome,

18:49.640 --> 18:52.360
 but also what you do, what you think, and what you feel,

18:52.360 --> 18:55.100
 and many of the little microbacteria

18:55.100 --> 18:57.420
 that get into your digestive tract

18:57.420 --> 18:59.920
 do so by way of social interactions.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.520
 In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist

19:02.520 --> 19:04.620
 what the role of the microbiome is,

19:04.620 --> 19:06.940
 they'll tell you almost certainly

19:06.940 --> 19:10.220
 that it's there to impact brain function.

19:10.220 --> 19:14.400
 But if you have friends that are microbiologists,

19:14.400 --> 19:17.640
 such as I do, they'll tell you,

19:17.640 --> 19:19.440
 well, maybe the brain and nervous system

19:19.440 --> 19:21.000
 are there to support the microbiome.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.560
 It's the other way around.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.080
 You have all these little microorganisms

19:24.080 --> 19:26.760
 that are taking residence in our body.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.440
 They don't really know what they're doing as far as we know.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.400
 We don't know that they have a consciousness or they don't.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.800
 We can't rule that out, but it seems pretty unlikely.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.320
 Nonetheless, they are taking advantage

19:36.320 --> 19:39.760
 of the different environments all along your digestive tract.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.600
 They are taking advantage

19:41.600 --> 19:43.800
 of the sorts of social interactions.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.220
 For instance, the people you talk to and that breathe on you

19:46.220 --> 19:47.980
 the people that you shake hands with,

19:47.980 --> 19:50.120
 the people that you kiss or don't kiss,

19:50.120 --> 19:50.960
 the people that you happen

19:50.960 --> 19:52.840
 to be romantically involved with or not,

19:52.840 --> 19:54.880
 your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,

19:54.880 --> 19:59.080
 whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbiome.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.060
 There's absolutely no question about that.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.560
 So hopefully now you have some sense

20:02.560 --> 20:05.320
 of the architecture of the digestive pathway

20:05.320 --> 20:06.480
 and you have some sense

20:06.480 --> 20:09.240
 of the trillions of little microbacteria

20:09.240 --> 20:12.240
 that are living all along the different components

20:12.240 --> 20:14.320
 of that digestive pathway.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.920
 But what we haven't talked about yet

20:15.920 --> 20:17.600
 and what I'd like to talk about now

20:17.600 --> 20:21.240
 is what those little microbiota are actually doing

20:21.240 --> 20:23.120
 in your digestive tract.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.300
 In addition to just living there

20:24.300 --> 20:26.320
 for their own intents and purposes,

20:26.320 --> 20:29.480
 they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.820
 Many of the genes that those microbiota make

20:32.820 --> 20:35.300
 are genes that are involved in fermentation

20:35.300 --> 20:37.560
 and genes that are involved in digestion

20:37.560 --> 20:40.000
 of particular types of nutrients.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.920
 And in a little bit, we will talk about

20:41.920 --> 20:46.120
 how what you eat can actually change the enzymes

20:46.120 --> 20:49.080
 that those microbiome components make.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.720
 Enzymes largely being things

20:50.720 --> 20:52.720
 that are responsible for digestion.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.780
 They catalyze other sorts of cellular events,

20:54.780 --> 20:56.880
 but in the context of the digestive pathway,

20:56.880 --> 20:59.280
 we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.760
 So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.440
 And if you lack certain microbiota

21:04.440 --> 21:06.100
 that can help you digest,

21:06.100 --> 21:07.920
 it stands to reason that you would have challenges

21:07.920 --> 21:09.960
 digesting certain types of foods.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.480
 The other amazing thing that these microbiota do

21:13.480 --> 21:16.680
 is they change the way that your brain functions

21:16.680 --> 21:20.840
 by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism

21:20.840 --> 21:23.200
 of particular neurotransmitters.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.400
 So one of the ways that having certain microbiota

21:25.400 --> 21:28.200
 present in your gut can improve your mood

21:28.200 --> 21:31.080
 or degrade your mood, for instance,

21:31.080 --> 21:36.080
 is by way of certain microbiota being converted into

21:36.080 --> 21:40.980
 or facilitating the conversion of chemicals such as GABA.

21:40.980 --> 21:44.520
 GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

21:44.520 --> 21:48.860
 It's involved in suppressing the action of other neurons.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.780
 And that might sound like a bad thing,

21:50.780 --> 21:53.960
 but all types of sedatives, for instance,

21:53.960 --> 21:57.840
 alcohol and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA

21:57.840 --> 21:59.740
 can help quiet certain circuits in the brain.

21:59.740 --> 22:03.240
 For instance, circuits responsible for anxiety.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.240
 In people who have epilepsy,

22:05.240 --> 22:07.760
 the GABAergic neurons, as they're called,

22:07.760 --> 22:10.520
 can often be disrupted in their signaling,

22:10.520 --> 22:12.600
 meaning they're not cranking out as much GABA,

22:12.600 --> 22:15.120
 and therefore the excitatory neurons,

22:15.120 --> 22:17.880
 which typically release other molecules like glutamate,

22:17.880 --> 22:20.940
 can engage in what's called runaway excitation,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.960
 and that can give rise to seizures.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.420
 So the simple message here is that the microbiota,

22:26.420 --> 22:28.840
 by way of making neurochemicals,

22:28.840 --> 22:31.300
 can influence the way that your brain functions.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.000
 So you want to support those microbiota,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.780
 and we will give you tools to support those microbiota.

22:36.780 --> 22:40.600
 But the takeaway at this point is that those microbiota

22:40.600 --> 22:43.440
 are making things locally to help digest food.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.320
 Other microbiota are helping

22:45.320 --> 22:47.960
 to make certain neurotransmitters like GABA,

22:47.960 --> 22:50.560
 and we'll also talk about dopamine and serotonin.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.800
 And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut

22:54.800 --> 22:58.680
 have a profound influence on many, many biological functions,

22:58.680 --> 23:01.060
 especially immune system function,

23:01.060 --> 23:03.640
 brain function, and digestion.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.840
 So that should give you a fairly complete picture

23:05.840 --> 23:08.260
 of your gut microbiome.

23:08.260 --> 23:10.680
 Now I'd like to talk about how your microbiome

23:10.680 --> 23:12.440
 and your brain communicate,

23:12.440 --> 23:14.280
 or more accurately, how your microbiome

23:14.280 --> 23:16.880
 and the rest of your nervous system communicate.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.600
 Neurons, which simply means nerve cells,

23:19.600 --> 23:22.340
 are the cells that do most of the heavy lifting

23:22.340 --> 23:23.280
 in your nervous system.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.760
 There are, of course, other cell types

23:24.760 --> 23:26.480
 that are important, glial cells, for instance,

23:26.480 --> 23:28.360
 very, very important cell types.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.700
 You have endothelial cells,

23:29.700 --> 23:32.240
 which are responsible for blood flow, pericytes,

23:32.240 --> 23:33.720
 and other types of cells.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.640
 But the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting

23:36.640 --> 23:38.400
 for most of the things we think about

23:38.400 --> 23:40.300
 in terms of nervous system function.

23:41.380 --> 23:44.180
 You have neurons in your gut,

23:44.180 --> 23:46.080
 and that should not surprise you.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.900
 Neurons reside in your brain, your spinal cord, your eyes,

23:49.900 --> 23:51.720
 in fact, all over your body,

23:51.720 --> 23:54.040
 and you've got them in your heart,

23:54.040 --> 23:56.320
 and you've got them in your lungs,

23:56.320 --> 23:58.220
 and you've got them in your spleen,

23:58.220 --> 24:00.600
 and they connect to all the different organs

24:00.600 --> 24:02.780
 and tissues of your body.

24:02.780 --> 24:05.500
 So that's not surprising that you have neurons in your gut.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.200
 What is surprising, however,

24:07.200 --> 24:09.920
 is the presence of particular types of neurons

24:09.920 --> 24:13.880
 that reside near or in the mucosal lining

24:13.880 --> 24:16.740
 just next to that lumen of the gut,

24:16.740 --> 24:18.820
 and that are paying attention,

24:18.820 --> 24:20.800
 and I'll explain what I mean by paying attention,

24:20.800 --> 24:23.080
 to the components of the gut,

24:23.080 --> 24:26.700
 both the nutrients and the microbiota,

24:26.700 --> 24:31.180
 and thereby can send signals up to the brain

24:31.180 --> 24:34.740
 by way of a long wire that we call an axon,

24:36.220 --> 24:39.680
 and can communicate what the chemistry

24:39.680 --> 24:42.100
 and what the nutritional quality

24:42.100 --> 24:44.040
 and what the other aspects of the environment

24:44.040 --> 24:47.640
 are at the gut at a given location up to the brain

24:47.640 --> 24:49.920
 in ways that can influence the brain to, for instance,

24:49.920 --> 24:52.600
 seek out more of a particular food.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.460
 Let me give you a sort of action-based picture of this.

24:55.460 --> 24:59.220
 Let's say, like most people, you enjoy sweet foods.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.840
 I don't particularly enjoy sweet foods,

25:00.840 --> 25:01.900
 but there are a few that I like.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.460
 I'm a sucker for a really good dark chocolate,

25:05.460 --> 25:07.300
 or really good ice cream,

25:07.300 --> 25:10.820
 or I got this thing for donuts that seems to just not quit,

25:10.820 --> 25:13.320
 although I don't tend to indulge it very often.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.160
 I do like them.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.980
 If I eat that particular food,

25:16.980 --> 25:19.420
 obviously digestion starts in the mouth,

25:19.420 --> 25:21.020
 there are enzymes there, it gets chewed up,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.620
 the food goes down into the gut.

25:23.500 --> 25:27.260
 These neurons are activated,

25:27.260 --> 25:30.800
 meaning that causes the neurons to be electrically active

25:30.800 --> 25:32.440
 when particular components,

25:32.440 --> 25:35.340
 certain nutrients in those foods are present.

25:35.340 --> 25:37.100
 And for the cell types,

25:37.100 --> 25:40.540
 or I should say the neuron types that matter here,

25:40.540 --> 25:43.420
 the nutrients that really trigger their activation

25:43.420 --> 25:47.280
 are sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.280
 Now, these particular neurons

25:50.280 --> 25:53.160
 have the name enteroendocrine cells,

25:53.160 --> 25:57.200
 but more recently they've been defined as neuropod cells.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.360
 Neuropod cells were discovered by Diego Bohorquez's lab

26:00.360 --> 26:02.240
 at Duke University.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.860
 This is a phenomenal set of discoveries

26:03.860 --> 26:06.320
 made mostly in the last 10 years.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.720
 These neuropod cells, as I mentioned,

26:08.720 --> 26:12.520
 are activated by sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids,

26:12.520 --> 26:17.400
 but have a particularly strong activation to sugars.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.400
 They do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.920
 And even though I'm focusing on this particular example,

26:22.920 --> 26:25.680
 they represent a really nice example

26:25.680 --> 26:29.360
 of how a particular set of nerve cells in our gut

26:29.360 --> 26:31.860
 is collecting information about what is there

26:31.860 --> 26:33.400
 at a particular location in the gut

26:33.400 --> 26:36.000
 and sending that information up to our brain.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.220
 Now, they do that by way of a nerve pathway

26:39.220 --> 26:40.920
 called the vagus nerve.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.200
 The vagus nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system,

26:43.200 --> 26:46.380
 and the vagus nerve is a little bit complex to describe

26:46.380 --> 26:48.240
 if you're just listening to this.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.440
 If you're watching this,

26:49.440 --> 26:51.580
 I'll try and use my hands as a diagram,

26:51.580 --> 26:53.300
 but really the best thing to do

26:53.300 --> 26:55.600
 if you really want to learn neuroanatomy

26:55.600 --> 26:58.040
 is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can,

26:58.040 --> 26:59.840
 and if you can track down a picture of it, terrific.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.800
 But here's how it works.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.080
 Neurons have a cell body that we call a soma.

27:04.080 --> 27:07.420
 That's where all the DNA are contained.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.720
 That's where a lot of the operating machinery

27:09.720 --> 27:11.320
 of the cells are contained,

27:11.320 --> 27:13.320
 and a lot of the instructions for that cell

27:13.320 --> 27:16.320
 of what to be and how to operate are contained.

27:16.320 --> 27:20.080
 The cell bodies of these neurons, or the relevant neurons,

27:20.080 --> 27:22.040
 are actually up near the neck.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.280
 So you can think of them as kind of a clump of grapes

27:25.280 --> 27:28.340
 because cell bodies tend to be round or oval-ish.

27:28.340 --> 27:32.800
 And then they send a process that we call an axon

27:32.800 --> 27:36.420
 in one direction out to the gut,

27:36.420 --> 27:40.480
 and they'll send another process up into the brain.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.760
 And that little cluster near the neck that's relevant here

27:43.760 --> 27:47.360
 is called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.140
 The nodose ganglion is a little cluster of neurons

27:50.140 --> 27:51.840
 on either side of the neck.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.500
 It has a process that goes out to the gut

27:53.500 --> 27:55.680
 and a process that goes up into the brain.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.800
 And again, these are just one component

27:57.800 --> 27:59.320
 of the so-called vagus nerve.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.740
 The vagus nerve has many, many branches,

28:02.740 --> 28:03.840
 not just to the gut.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.360
 There are also branches to the liver,

28:06.360 --> 28:09.060
 branches to the lungs, branches to the heart,

28:09.060 --> 28:11.960
 branches to the larynx, and even to the spleen

28:11.960 --> 28:14.840
 and other areas of the body that are important.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.680
 But right now, we're just concentrating on the neurons

28:16.680 --> 28:19.200
 that are in the gut that signal up to the brain.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.560
 And what the Bohorkas lab has shown

28:22.560 --> 28:25.720
 is that these neuropod cells are part of this network.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.280
 They're sensing several different nutrients,

28:28.280 --> 28:30.280
 but in particular, when they send sugar,

28:30.280 --> 28:34.160
 they send signals in the form of electrical firing

28:34.160 --> 28:37.080
 up to the brain in ways that trigger activation

28:37.080 --> 28:40.520
 of other brain stations that cause you to seek out

28:40.520 --> 28:42.320
 more of that particular food.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.560
 Now, this brings us to some classic experiments

28:45.560 --> 28:48.440
 that, at least to me, are incredible.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.740
 And these are highly reproducible findings

28:50.740 --> 28:54.900
 showing, for instance, that even if you bypass taste

28:54.900 --> 28:59.900
 by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods into the gut

29:01.700 --> 29:04.460
 and people can never taste them with their mouth,

29:04.460 --> 29:07.760
 people will seek out more of that particular food.

29:07.760 --> 29:12.360
 And if you give them the option to have a sweet food

29:12.360 --> 29:15.300
 infused into their gut or a bitter food

29:15.300 --> 29:19.120
 infused into their gut or a sweet versus sour

29:19.120 --> 29:21.760
 or a more sweet versus less sweet food,

29:21.760 --> 29:25.160
 people have a selective preference for sweet foods

29:25.160 --> 29:27.280
 even if they can't taste them.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.860
 Now, this is important to understand

29:28.860 --> 29:30.420
 in the context of gut brain signaling,

29:30.420 --> 29:33.040
 because we always think that we like sweet foods

29:33.040 --> 29:34.760
 because of the way they taste.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.120
 And indeed, that's still true,

29:37.120 --> 29:41.460
 but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food

29:41.460 --> 29:43.740
 also has to do with a gut sensation

29:43.740 --> 29:46.340
 that is below our conscious detection.

29:46.340 --> 29:47.480
 How do we know that?

29:47.480 --> 29:51.000
 Well, the Bohorkas lab has performed experiments

29:51.000 --> 29:53.280
 using modern methods and their classic experiments

29:53.280 --> 29:56.920
 showing that animals and humans will actively seek out

29:56.920 --> 29:58.920
 more of a particular sweet food

29:58.920 --> 30:01.760
 even if it bypasses this taste system.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.020
 And the reverse is also true.

30:04.020 --> 30:07.240
 There have been experiments done in animals and in humans

30:07.240 --> 30:09.520
 that have allowed animals or humans

30:09.520 --> 30:11.740
 to select and eat sweet foods.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.680
 And indeed, that's what they do if they're given the option.

30:15.960 --> 30:20.680
 And yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these neurons

30:20.680 --> 30:23.660
 within the gut that can sense sweet foods.

30:23.660 --> 30:24.720
 Now, there are a couple of different ways

30:24.720 --> 30:26.200
 that those experiments have been done.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.440
 In classic experiments that date back to the 80s,

30:29.440 --> 30:32.480
 this was done by what's called subdiaphragmatic vagotomy.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.640
 So this means cutting off the branch of the vagus

30:34.640 --> 30:37.160
 that innervates the gut below the diaphragm

30:37.160 --> 30:38.920
 so that the other organs can still function

30:38.920 --> 30:40.620
 because the vagus is very important.

30:40.620 --> 30:43.440
 But basically cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut,

30:43.440 --> 30:44.840
 still giving people the opportunity

30:44.840 --> 30:46.320
 to taste sweet foods with their mouth,

30:46.320 --> 30:48.480
 and they don't actively seek out

30:48.480 --> 30:50.480
 quite as much of the sweet food

30:50.480 --> 30:52.800
 when they don't have this gut sensing mechanism

30:52.800 --> 30:55.960
 that we now know to be dependent on these neuropod cells.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.560
 More recent experiments involve selective silencing

30:59.560 --> 31:01.120
 of these neuropod cells,

31:01.120 --> 31:02.900
 and there've been a lot of different derivations

31:02.900 --> 31:03.920
 of this sort of thing.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.000
 But the takeaway from it is that our experience of

31:07.000 --> 31:09.020
 and our desire for particular foods

31:09.020 --> 31:11.480
 has everything to do with how those foods taste.

31:11.480 --> 31:15.460
 It also has to do, as you probably know, with their texture

31:15.460 --> 31:18.240
 and the sensation of those foods in our mouth,

31:18.240 --> 31:20.660
 and even indeed how they go down our throat

31:20.660 --> 31:23.160
 sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.160
 And it also has to do with the subconscious processing

31:28.160 --> 31:31.880
 of taste that occurs in the gut itself.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.480
 And again, when I say gut, I don't just mean in the stomach.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.260
 There are actually neurons, neuropod cells

31:37.260 --> 31:39.040
 further down your digestive tract,

31:39.040 --> 31:40.860
 which are signaling to your brain

31:40.860 --> 31:42.400
 about the presence of sweet foods,

31:42.400 --> 31:46.080
 as well as foods such as amino acid rich foods

31:46.080 --> 31:49.400
 or foods that are rich in particular types of fatty acids

31:49.400 --> 31:53.800
 signaling up to your brain and causing you to seek out

31:53.800 --> 31:57.160
 more of those foods or to consume more of those foods.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.280
 Now you're probably asking, what is the signal?

31:59.280 --> 32:01.880
 How does it actually make me want more of those foods

32:01.880 --> 32:03.300
 without me realizing it?

32:03.300 --> 32:05.360
 Well, it does that by adjusting the release

32:05.360 --> 32:07.800
 of particular neuromodulators.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.200
 For those of you that are not familiar with neuromodulators,

32:10.200 --> 32:11.740
 these are similar to neurotransmitters,

32:11.740 --> 32:13.760
 but they tend to act more broadly.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.240
 They tend to impact many more neurons all at once.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.000
 And they go by names like dopamine, serotonin,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.640
 acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.040
 Sometimes people refer to those as neurotransmitters.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.840
 Technically they are neuromodulators.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.840
 I'll refer to them almost always as neuromodulators.

32:28.840 --> 32:32.640
 The neuropod cells signal by way of a particular branch

32:32.640 --> 32:35.320
 of the vagus through the nodose ganglion

32:35.320 --> 32:36.960
 that we talked about before,

32:36.960 --> 32:39.720
 and through a number of different stations

32:39.720 --> 32:43.440
 in the brainstem eventually cause the release

32:43.440 --> 32:45.740
 of the neuromodulator dopamine.

32:45.740 --> 32:49.020
 Dopamine is often associated with a sense of pleasure

32:49.020 --> 32:52.240
 and reward, but it is more appropriately thought of

32:52.240 --> 32:54.720
 as a neuromodulator that impacts motivation,

32:54.720 --> 32:55.800
 craving, and pursuit.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.840
 It tends to put us into modes of action,

32:57.840 --> 33:00.580
 not necessarily running and moving through space,

33:00.580 --> 33:01.980
 although it can do that too.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.320
 But in the context of feeding,

33:03.320 --> 33:07.880
 it tends to make us look around more, chew more,

33:07.880 --> 33:10.720
 reach for things more, and seek out more of whatever it is

33:10.720 --> 33:15.720
 that's giving us that sensation of delight or satisfaction.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.600
 And again, that sense of delight and satisfaction

33:18.600 --> 33:20.960
 you might experience only consciously

33:20.960 --> 33:23.280
 as the way that something tastes on your mouth,

33:23.280 --> 33:25.200
 but it actually is caused again

33:25.200 --> 33:27.800
 by both the sensations in your mouth,

33:27.800 --> 33:31.080
 but also by the activation of these neuropod cells.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.120
 So this is an incredible system of gut brain signaling,

33:34.120 --> 33:36.680
 and it is but one system of gut brain signaling.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.740
 It turns out it's the system that we know the most about

33:39.740 --> 33:41.120
 at this point in time.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.160
 There are other components of gut brain signaling

33:43.160 --> 33:44.320
 that we'll talk about in a moment.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.860
 For instance, the serotonin system.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.440
 But in terms of examples of gut brain signaling

33:49.440 --> 33:51.800
 for which we know a lot of the individual elements

33:51.800 --> 33:55.960
 and how they work, I think this neuropod neuron sensing

33:55.960 --> 33:59.400
 of sweet foods, fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut,

33:59.400 --> 34:03.320
 and communicating that up to the brain by way of the vagus

34:03.320 --> 34:05.380
 and causing us to seek out more of the foods

34:05.380 --> 34:08.840
 that deliver those nutrients is an incredible pathway

34:08.840 --> 34:10.640
 that really delineates the beauty

34:10.640 --> 34:13.260
 and the power of this gut brain axis.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.560
 Let me talk about timescales.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.240
 Here I'm talking about a particular type of neuron

34:17.240 --> 34:20.920
 that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals

34:20.920 --> 34:23.040
 to cause us to want to seek out

34:23.040 --> 34:25.340
 a particular category of foods.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.760
 That's happening relatively fast

34:28.760 --> 34:31.040
 compared to the hormone pathways of the gut,

34:31.040 --> 34:32.600
 which also involve neurons.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.080
 So your gut is also communicating to your brain

34:35.080 --> 34:36.900
 by way of neurons, nerve cells.

34:36.900 --> 34:41.900
 But some of those nerve cells also release hormones.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.300
 And those hormones go by names like CCK,

34:44.300 --> 34:47.780
 glucagon-like peptide one, PYY, et cetera.

34:49.060 --> 34:51.700
 A good example of a hormone pathway

34:51.700 --> 34:54.420
 or what sometimes is called a hormone peptide pathway

34:54.420 --> 34:58.180
 that is similar to the pathway I've talked about before,

34:58.180 --> 35:01.740
 but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway.

35:01.740 --> 35:04.820
 Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N,

35:04.820 --> 35:07.620
 increases with fasting.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.100
 So the longer it's been since you've eaten

35:10.100 --> 35:12.220
 or if you're just eating very little food

35:12.220 --> 35:14.020
 compared to your caloric needs,

35:14.020 --> 35:16.360
 ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream

35:16.360 --> 35:18.740
 and they go up because of processes

35:18.740 --> 35:21.140
 that include processes within the gut

35:21.140 --> 35:22.900
 and include the nervous system.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.820
 So it's a slow pathway driving you

35:24.820 --> 35:27.060
 to seek out food generally.

35:27.060 --> 35:30.100
 As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial

35:30.100 --> 35:35.540
 to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on.

35:35.540 --> 35:38.500
 Ghrelin increases the longer it's been

35:38.500 --> 35:40.580
 since you've eaten sufficient calories

35:40.580 --> 35:44.140
 and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.980
 Well, how does it do that?

35:45.980 --> 35:48.260
 It does that again by impacting neural circuits

35:48.260 --> 35:50.700
 within the brain, neural circuits that include

35:50.700 --> 35:52.860
 what we call the brainstem autonomic centers.

35:52.860 --> 35:54.860
 So it tends to make you feel alert

35:54.860 --> 35:58.480
 and quite, we say high levels of autonomic arousal.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.940
 If you haven't eaten in a while,

35:59.940 --> 36:02.160
 you might think that you just get really exhausted, right?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.860
 Because we all hear that food is energy

36:03.860 --> 36:05.940
 and caloric energy is what we need to burn,

36:05.940 --> 36:08.340
 but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body

36:08.340 --> 36:12.820
 that you would be able to use if you really needed energy.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.340
 But typically we haven't eaten in a while,

36:14.340 --> 36:15.860
 we start to get agitated

36:15.860 --> 36:17.780
 and we get agitated by way of release

36:17.780 --> 36:20.020
 of the neuromodulator epinephrine,

36:20.020 --> 36:22.140
 which causes us to look around more,

36:22.140 --> 36:24.080
 move around more and seek out food.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.500
 That all occurs in brainstem autonomic centers

36:27.500 --> 36:28.540
 and in the hypothalamus.

36:28.540 --> 36:30.920
 We did an entire episode on feeding behavior

36:30.920 --> 36:32.640
 and metabolism as well,

36:32.640 --> 36:34.760
 and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.420
 So I don't want to go into a lot of detail

36:36.420 --> 36:38.660
 about hypothalamic and brainstem centers,

36:38.660 --> 36:40.760
 but there's a particular area of the brain

36:40.760 --> 36:43.220
 called the nucleus of the solitary tract,

36:43.220 --> 36:45.140
 the NST as it's called,

36:45.140 --> 36:48.240
 that's very strongly impacted by these circulating hormones

36:48.240 --> 36:50.700
 and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.900
 So the important point here is that we have a fast system

36:53.900 --> 36:56.060
 that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut

36:56.060 --> 36:57.660
 or the absence of nutrients in our gut

36:57.660 --> 36:59.560
 and stimulating us to seek out food

36:59.560 --> 37:01.300
 or to stop eating certain foods.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.660
 And we have a slower hormone-related system

37:04.660 --> 37:07.500
 that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain.

37:07.500 --> 37:12.340
 But all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding.

37:12.340 --> 37:14.040
 The neural circuits for feeding include things

37:14.040 --> 37:15.820
 like the arcuate nucleus, the hypothalamus,

37:15.820 --> 37:18.020
 they include a bunch of other neurochemicals,

37:18.020 --> 37:20.380
 but the point is that you've got a fast route

37:20.380 --> 37:25.040
 and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less,

37:25.040 --> 37:28.780
 to seek out food and consume it, or to stop eating,

37:28.780 --> 37:32.460
 to essentially kickstart the satiety mechanisms

37:32.460 --> 37:33.700
 as they're called.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.780
 And those are operating in parallel.

37:35.780 --> 37:38.020
 It's not like one happens first, then stops, then the other.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.620
 They're always operating in parallel.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.020
 And I bring this up because there's a bigger theme here,

37:42.020 --> 37:44.260
 which we see over and over again in biology,

37:44.260 --> 37:46.140
 which is the concept of parallel pathways.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.340
 You've always got multiple accelerators

37:48.340 --> 37:49.660
 and multiple breaks on a system.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.180
 It's very, very rare to have just one accelerator

37:52.180 --> 37:53.580
 and one break on the system.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.900
 And this will become important later

37:54.900 --> 37:58.260
 when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome

37:58.260 --> 38:00.580
 for healthy eating and for healthy digestion

38:00.580 --> 38:02.020
 and for healthy brain function.

38:02.020 --> 38:02.860
 I want to take a moment

38:02.860 --> 38:05.840
 and talk about glucagon-like peptide 1,

38:05.840 --> 38:08.980
 which is also called GLP-1.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.780
 GLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut

38:13.780 --> 38:16.060
 and by neurons in the brain.

38:16.060 --> 38:20.260
 This is a fairly recent discovery, but it's an important one.

38:20.260 --> 38:24.180
 GLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding

38:24.180 --> 38:26.400
 and tends to reduce appetite.

38:27.580 --> 38:31.800
 There are a number of drugs released on the market now.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.760
 One, for instance, goes by the name semaglutide,

38:34.760 --> 38:38.220
 which is essentially an GLP-1 agonist.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.380
 It causes the release of more GLP-1.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.560
 It's being used to treat type 2 diabetes,

38:42.560 --> 38:44.380
 which is insulin resistant diabetes.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.320
 This is different than type 1 diabetes,

38:46.320 --> 38:48.740
 where people don't actually make insulin.

38:48.740 --> 38:53.740
 It's also being used as a drug to reduce obesity.

38:53.740 --> 38:55.580
 And it seems pretty effective,

38:55.580 --> 38:57.900
 at least in certain populations.

38:57.900 --> 39:01.180
 There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP-1.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.280
 I've talked about a few of these on the podcast.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.540
 One that I'm a particular fan of

39:04.540 --> 39:07.900
 for entirely other reasons is yerba mate tea

39:07.900 --> 39:10.580
 can stimulate the release of GLP-1.

39:10.580 --> 39:13.260
 In South America, it's often used as an appetite suppressant,

39:13.260 --> 39:14.380
 probably in large part

39:14.380 --> 39:16.760
 because of its effects on GLP-1 release,

39:17.800 --> 39:20.380
 but probably also because it does contain caffeine,

39:20.380 --> 39:21.500
 which is a bit of a stimulant,

39:21.500 --> 39:23.300
 which also can be involved in lipolysis,

39:23.300 --> 39:25.400
 which is the utilization of fat stores for energy

39:25.400 --> 39:26.240
 and so forth.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.900
 A brief mention about yerba mate.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.860
 There are some reports out there

39:31.860 --> 39:35.240
 that yerba mate can increase certain types of cancers.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.960
 The data that I've seen on this

39:37.960 --> 39:39.720
 is that it tends to relate to whether or not

39:39.720 --> 39:43.020
 those are smoked versions of the yerba mate tea,

39:43.020 --> 39:45.660
 the amount of consumption, and the debate is still out.

39:45.660 --> 39:47.340
 So I invite you to look at those papers.

39:47.340 --> 39:49.020
 You can search for those online.

39:49.020 --> 39:54.020
 Nonetheless, yerba mate is one source of GLP-1 stimulation.

39:55.140 --> 39:56.700
 Semaglutide is another source.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.740
 It also can be stimulated by various foods,

39:58.740 --> 40:01.880
 nuts, avocados, eggs, and so forth.

40:01.880 --> 40:06.700
 Certain high fiber complex grains will also stimulate GLP-1.

40:06.700 --> 40:09.900
 I raise this as not necessarily a route

40:09.900 --> 40:12.680
 that you want to take in order to reduce food intake.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.540
 I don't even know that that's your goal,

40:14.540 --> 40:19.100
 but that GLP-1 is another one of these gut

40:19.100 --> 40:22.140
 to brain signaling mechanisms that adjusts appetite

40:22.140 --> 40:24.500
 that is dependent on diet,

40:24.500 --> 40:26.740
 depends on what you eat or drink,

40:26.740 --> 40:30.620
 and that the GLP-1 pathway does seem particularly sensitive

40:30.620 --> 40:32.660
 to the constituents of diet.

40:32.660 --> 40:35.160
 There's at least one quality study I was able to find

40:35.160 --> 40:37.480
 showing that the ketogenic diet, for instance,

40:37.480 --> 40:40.380
 which almost always involves ingestion

40:40.380 --> 40:44.100
 of very low levels of carbohydrate, can increase GLP-1.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.220
 Although, as I mentioned before,

40:45.220 --> 40:48.000
 there are other foods that fall outside the range

40:48.000 --> 40:49.340
 of what we would consider ketogenic

40:49.340 --> 40:50.900
 that can also stimulate GLP-1.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.500
 And as I mentioned, there are prescription drugs

40:52.500 --> 40:55.260
 like semaglutide, there are other ones as well now,

40:55.260 --> 40:57.460
 that stimulate GLP-1.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.460
 So how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?

40:59.460 --> 41:02.740
 It does that in part by changing the activity of neurons

41:02.740 --> 41:04.900
 in the hypothalamus, this cluster of neurons

41:04.900 --> 41:06.880
 just above the roof of our mouth

41:06.880 --> 41:09.700
 that themselves make GLP-1

41:09.700 --> 41:12.860
 and that cause the activation of motor circuits

41:12.860 --> 41:16.580
 for reaching, chewing, all the things that we associate

41:16.580 --> 41:18.040
 with feeding behavior.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.340
 So I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway

41:20.340 --> 41:22.660
 that you might choose to tap into by ingestion

41:22.660 --> 41:25.180
 of Yerba Monte or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,

41:25.180 --> 41:28.060
 or if it's something that interests you, ketogenic diet.

41:28.060 --> 41:30.060
 But I also mention it simply

41:30.060 --> 41:32.620
 because it's another beautiful example

41:32.620 --> 41:35.420
 of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity

41:35.420 --> 41:37.560
 of brain circuits that are directly involved

41:37.560 --> 41:39.360
 in a particular behavior.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.660
 So yet another example of how gut is communicating

41:42.660 --> 41:46.420
 to brain in order to change what we think we want

41:46.420 --> 41:49.060
 or to change what our actual behaviors are.

41:49.060 --> 41:51.380
 So the next time you find yourself reaching for food

41:51.380 --> 41:55.380
 or you find yourself wanting a particular sweet thing

41:55.380 --> 41:58.440
 or fatty thing or something that contains a lot

41:58.440 --> 42:01.620
 of amino acids, a protein rich food,

42:01.620 --> 42:03.780
 keep in mind that that's not just about the taste

42:03.780 --> 42:04.620
 of the food.

42:04.620 --> 42:06.620
 And it's not even necessarily about the nutrients

42:06.620 --> 42:09.180
 that you need or don't need, it could be,

42:09.180 --> 42:11.460
 but it's also about the subconscious signaling

42:11.460 --> 42:13.380
 that's coming from your body all the time,

42:13.380 --> 42:17.500
 waves of hormones, waves of nerve cell signals,

42:17.500 --> 42:19.620
 electrical signals that are changing the way

42:19.620 --> 42:21.420
 that your brain works.

42:21.420 --> 42:25.060
 And this raises for me a memory of the episode

42:25.060 --> 42:27.820
 that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,

42:27.820 --> 42:30.500
 who's a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford,

42:30.500 --> 42:34.180
 who is expert on things like hormones and behavior.

42:34.180 --> 42:36.320
 But we got into the topic of free will,

42:36.320 --> 42:38.500
 which is a bit of a barbed wire topic.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.940
 As many of you know, it gets into the realm

42:39.940 --> 42:42.580
 of philosophy, et cetera, and we were kind of batting back

42:42.580 --> 42:45.820
 and forth the idea, I was saying, well,

42:45.820 --> 42:48.100
 I think there's free will and can't there certainly

42:48.100 --> 42:51.300
 be free will or certainly the idea

42:51.300 --> 42:52.960
 that we can avoid certain choices.

42:52.960 --> 42:57.900
 And Robert was saying, no, in fact, he said, nah,

42:57.900 --> 42:59.820
 he doesn't believe that we have any free will.

42:59.820 --> 43:03.000
 He thinks that events in our brain are determined

43:03.000 --> 43:06.780
 by biological events that are below our conscious detection

43:06.780 --> 43:09.060
 and that occur seconds to milliseconds

43:09.060 --> 43:11.240
 before we make decisions or assessments.

43:11.240 --> 43:14.500
 And therefore we just can't control what we do,

43:14.500 --> 43:16.340
 what we think and what we feel.

43:16.340 --> 43:19.020
 And at the time I sort of didn't buy it.

43:19.020 --> 43:20.460
 I thought, I don't know.

43:20.460 --> 43:23.220
 I just, I guess I really wanted to believe in free will.

43:23.220 --> 43:25.020
 And to some extent I still do.

43:25.020 --> 43:27.580
 But as we talk about how these neurons in our gut

43:27.580 --> 43:30.620
 and these hormones in our gut are influencing our brain

43:30.620 --> 43:32.300
 and the decisions that we are making,

43:32.300 --> 43:34.660
 at the level of circuits like the hypothalamus

43:34.660 --> 43:36.540
 and the nucleus of the solitary tract,

43:36.540 --> 43:39.660
 these are areas of the brain way below our frontal cortex

43:39.660 --> 43:41.160
 and our conscious perception.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.700
 I think these are examples that really fall in favor

43:44.700 --> 43:46.900
 of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,

43:46.900 --> 43:49.620
 which is that events that are happening within our body

43:49.620 --> 43:51.140
 are actually changing the way our brain works.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.220
 So we might think that we want the cupcake.

43:53.220 --> 43:56.780
 We might think that we don't need to eat something

43:56.780 --> 43:58.140
 or do need to eat something.

43:58.140 --> 44:01.660
 And that is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge

44:01.660 --> 44:04.020
 and decision-making that we're making with our head.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.060
 But in fact, it's very clear to me

44:06.060 --> 44:08.420
 based on the work from the Bohork's lab,

44:08.420 --> 44:09.860
 classic work over the years,

44:09.860 --> 44:12.180
 dating back to the 80s and indeed back to the 50s

44:12.180 --> 44:13.680
 that we'll talk about in a moment,

44:13.680 --> 44:16.380
 that our body is shaping the decisions

44:16.380 --> 44:19.580
 that our brain is making and we're not aware of it at all.

44:19.580 --> 44:21.460
 Now, the good news is that whether or not

44:21.460 --> 44:23.180
 you believe in free will or not,

44:23.180 --> 44:26.300
 the simple knowledge that this whole process is happening

44:26.300 --> 44:27.900
 can perhaps be a benefit to you.

44:27.900 --> 44:31.060
 You can perhaps leverage it to get some insight

44:31.060 --> 44:32.820
 and understanding and perhaps even a wedge

44:32.820 --> 44:33.660
 into your own behavior.

44:33.660 --> 44:37.140
 You might think, ah, I think I want that particular food

44:37.140 --> 44:39.500
 or I think I want to avoid that particular food,

44:39.500 --> 44:41.900
 but actually that's not a decision

44:41.900 --> 44:44.160
 that I'm making on a purely rational basis.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.980
 It has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain.

44:46.980 --> 44:50.120
 So we've largely been talking about chemical communication

44:50.120 --> 44:51.740
 between the gut and the brain.

44:51.740 --> 44:55.580
 Chemical because even though these neuropod cells

44:55.580 --> 44:57.000
 are communicating with the brain

44:57.000 --> 44:59.040
 by way of electrical activity,

44:59.040 --> 45:00.620
 what we call action potentials,

45:00.620 --> 45:03.380
 and in neural language, we call those spikes,

45:03.380 --> 45:04.980
 spikes of action potentials.

45:06.540 --> 45:10.600
 Spikes of action potentials, meaning those neural signals,

45:10.600 --> 45:14.160
 cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.960
 So it's chemical transmission.

45:18.520 --> 45:21.380
 Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly,

45:21.380 --> 45:25.960
 hormones like neuropeptide Y, like CCK, like ghrelin,

45:25.960 --> 45:28.020
 they are signaling chemically.

45:28.020 --> 45:30.100
 They're moving through the body.

45:30.100 --> 45:32.940
 They're going in there affecting the chemical output

45:32.940 --> 45:34.140
 of different cells,

45:34.140 --> 45:36.140
 and they're changing the chemistry of those cells

45:36.140 --> 45:38.620
 and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to.

45:38.620 --> 45:41.580
 So that gives us one particular category of signaling

45:41.580 --> 45:44.900
 from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling.

45:44.900 --> 45:47.520
 But of course, there are other forms of signals,

45:47.520 --> 45:51.500
 and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling.

45:51.500 --> 45:52.820
 You're probably familiar with this.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.800
 If you've ever eaten a very large meal

45:54.800 --> 45:56.700
 or consumed a lot of fluid,

45:56.700 --> 45:59.220
 you experience that as distension of the gut,

45:59.220 --> 46:02.320
 and that doesn't just have to be distension of the stomach,

46:02.320 --> 46:06.060
 but distension of your intestines as well.

46:06.060 --> 46:08.260
 That distension is registered by neurons

46:08.260 --> 46:09.880
 that reside in your gut.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.220
 The signals go up to your brain

46:11.220 --> 46:12.780
 and communicate with areas of the brain

46:12.780 --> 46:15.780
 that are responsible for suppressing further consumption

46:15.780 --> 46:17.700
 of food and or fluid,

46:17.700 --> 46:21.540
 and under certain circumstances can also be associated

46:21.540 --> 46:23.860
 with the activation of neural circuits

46:23.860 --> 46:26.020
 that cause vomiting or the desire to vomit.

46:26.020 --> 46:28.040
 So if ever you've eaten too much

46:28.040 --> 46:30.260
 or you've eaten something that doesn't agree with you,

46:30.260 --> 46:33.940
 that information is communicated by way of mechanosensors

46:33.940 --> 46:36.180
 that sense the mechanics of your gut,

46:36.180 --> 46:37.860
 possibly also the chemistry of your gut,

46:37.860 --> 46:39.980
 but mostly the mechanics of your gut,

46:39.980 --> 46:42.840
 signal up to the brain and activate brain centers

46:42.840 --> 46:46.660
 that are involved in stopping the eating behavior

46:46.660 --> 46:50.460
 and activation of an area of the brainstem

46:50.460 --> 46:53.820
 that is affectionately referred to as the vomit center

46:53.820 --> 46:55.060
 among neuroanatomists.

46:55.060 --> 46:57.820
 This is a area that more appropriately

46:57.820 --> 46:59.820
 is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone,

46:59.820 --> 47:03.180
 the CTZ or area postrema and neurons in this area

47:03.180 --> 47:06.780
 actually will trigger the vomiting reflex.

47:06.780 --> 47:10.100
 So the way that the gut and the brain communicate

47:10.100 --> 47:11.960
 is both chemical and mechanical,

47:11.960 --> 47:13.420
 and it can be both for sake

47:13.420 --> 47:16.940
 of increasing certain types of behavior.

47:16.940 --> 47:18.740
 Today we're talking mainly about feeding behavior

47:18.740 --> 47:23.120
 up until now anyway, but also ceasing to eat,

47:23.120 --> 47:25.160
 closing your mouth, moving away from food,

47:25.160 --> 47:26.820
 turning away from food,

47:26.820 --> 47:28.260
 all behaviors that we're familiar with

47:28.260 --> 47:31.260
 anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation

47:31.260 --> 47:35.500
 of this mechanosensor for gastric distress.

47:35.500 --> 47:38.340
 So we've got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling.

47:38.340 --> 47:41.060
 And I also want to emphasize that we have direct

47:41.060 --> 47:44.020
 and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain.

47:44.020 --> 47:46.220
 Direct signaling is the kind of signaling

47:46.220 --> 47:48.740
 of the sort I've been talking about mainly up until now,

47:48.740 --> 47:51.340
 which is neurons in the gut,

47:51.340 --> 47:53.140
 communicating with neurons in the brainstem

47:53.140 --> 47:55.360
 that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.340
 And of course, those are also going to interact

47:57.340 --> 47:59.460
 with neurons of the prefrontal cortex,

47:59.460 --> 48:00.740
 which is the area of your brain involved

48:00.740 --> 48:02.400
 in decision-making, the, you know,

48:02.400 --> 48:05.220
 I think it was the shrimp that made me sick.

48:05.220 --> 48:07.320
 I'm going to, I just don't want any more of that.

48:07.320 --> 48:10.140
 Or I'm never going back to that restaurant again,

48:10.140 --> 48:12.960
 because after I ate there about an hour later,

48:12.960 --> 48:14.580
 I started feeling really not well.

48:14.580 --> 48:17.040
 I felt kind of feverish, but my gut didn't feel well.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.100
 My digestion was really off.

48:19.100 --> 48:21.400
 All of that kind of information is handled

48:21.400 --> 48:23.720
 in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level,

48:23.720 --> 48:25.980
 but the immediate decision to stop eating

48:25.980 --> 48:27.420
 or to eat more of something,

48:27.420 --> 48:28.780
 to move towards something or away from it,

48:28.780 --> 48:32.200
 that's made by neural circuits that reside at the,

48:32.200 --> 48:34.160
 we would say the subconscious level.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.820
 But what we really mean is below the level of the neocortex.

48:36.820 --> 48:38.900
 Below the cortex means essentially

48:38.900 --> 48:40.980
 below our level of conscious awareness.

48:40.980 --> 48:43.660
 So we talked about two types of information within the gut

48:43.660 --> 48:45.340
 that are communicated to the brain.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.580
 Chemical information, meaning information

48:47.580 --> 48:49.100
 about the nutrients that happen to be there

48:49.100 --> 48:50.420
 and mechanical information,

48:50.420 --> 48:53.380
 distension of the gut or lack of distension and so forth.

48:53.380 --> 48:55.580
 And we talked about how these neuropod cells

48:55.580 --> 48:56.980
 can signal the release of dopamine

48:56.980 --> 48:58.180
 in circuits within the brain

48:58.180 --> 49:00.580
 to cause you to seek out more of something.

49:00.580 --> 49:04.660
 Now, in a very logically consistent way,

49:04.660 --> 49:08.780
 dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.360
 You might think, well, that doesn't make any sense.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.100
 I thought dopamine was always a good thing.

49:12.100 --> 49:14.780
 It's involved in moderation and reward, et cetera.

49:14.780 --> 49:16.540
 But turns out the area postrema,

49:16.540 --> 49:19.460
 this vomit center and the brainstem

49:19.460 --> 49:22.220
 is chock-a-block full of dopamine receptors.

49:22.220 --> 49:24.700
 And if dopamine levels go too high,

49:24.700 --> 49:26.380
 it can actually trigger vomiting.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.500
 And this we see in the context of various drugs

49:29.500 --> 49:31.580
 that are used to treat things like Parkinson's.

49:31.580 --> 49:34.300
 Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine

49:34.300 --> 49:35.520
 or a lack of dopamine neurons,

49:35.520 --> 49:37.460
 typically that causes a resting tremor,

49:37.460 --> 49:38.580
 difficulty in movement,

49:38.580 --> 49:39.960
 because dopamine is also associated

49:39.960 --> 49:43.160
 with a lot of the neural circuits for movement.

49:43.160 --> 49:47.380
 Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson's like L-DOPA

49:47.380 --> 49:49.880
 increase levels of dopamine so much,

49:49.880 --> 49:52.820
 or at least activate dopamine receptors

49:52.820 --> 49:55.920
 to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain

49:55.920 --> 49:58.360
 that they can cause activation of things

49:58.360 --> 50:01.700
 like the trigger to vomit.

50:01.700 --> 50:04.180
 Now, this should also make sense in the natural context

50:04.180 --> 50:05.780
 of if you gorge yourself with food,

50:05.780 --> 50:08.100
 gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food,

50:08.100 --> 50:11.180
 the neurons in your gut that respond to that

50:11.180 --> 50:13.500
 are simply detecting the presence of nutrients,

50:13.500 --> 50:16.340
 but they don't really make decisions themselves.

50:16.340 --> 50:18.100
 They don't know to stop eating.

50:18.100 --> 50:21.260
 Your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food.

50:21.260 --> 50:23.580
 And so it's a wonderful thing that those neurons

50:23.580 --> 50:25.580
 are communicating with areas of the brain,

50:25.580 --> 50:27.900
 not just that stimulate consuming more food,

50:27.900 --> 50:31.080
 but that are communicating with areas of the brain,

50:31.080 --> 50:32.740
 for instance, areopostrema,

50:32.740 --> 50:34.980
 that when dopamine levels get too high,

50:35.940 --> 50:38.820
 cause us to either stop eating that food

50:38.820 --> 50:41.900
 or in the case of vomiting, to eject that food.

50:41.900 --> 50:43.540
 So I raise this,

50:43.540 --> 50:46.720
 and not to give you a kind of a disgusting counterexample

50:46.720 --> 50:49.220
 to what we call repetitive behaviors,

50:49.220 --> 50:51.080
 things that we like to do more of,

50:51.080 --> 50:54.460
 but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly

50:54.460 --> 50:56.340
 even these reflexes that we think of

50:56.340 --> 50:58.220
 as feeling sick and vomiting,

50:58.220 --> 51:00.220
 or the desire to seek out more food

51:00.220 --> 51:03.180
 are really being controlled by a kind of push-pull system,

51:03.180 --> 51:05.440
 by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.140
 And the same neurochemicals, in this case, dopamine,

51:08.140 --> 51:12.140
 are being used to create two opposite type behaviors,

51:12.140 --> 51:13.700
 one behavior to consume more,

51:13.700 --> 51:15.180
 one behavior to get rid of everything

51:15.180 --> 51:16.460
 you've already consumed.

51:16.460 --> 51:18.600
 So our brain is actually sensitive

51:18.600 --> 51:21.380
 to the amount of signaling coming from our gut,

51:21.380 --> 51:24.980
 not just the path by which that signal arrives.

51:24.980 --> 51:28.820
 Our brain is very carefully paying attention

51:28.820 --> 51:30.420
 to whether or not the levels of dopamine

51:30.420 --> 51:32.860
 that are being triggered are within a normal range

51:32.860 --> 51:34.220
 for typical eating behavior,

51:34.220 --> 51:35.700
 or whether or not we've gorged ourselves

51:35.700 --> 51:37.620
 to the point where enough already.

51:37.620 --> 51:41.060
 Now, of course, mechanical signals will also play

51:41.060 --> 51:44.980
 into areopostrema and into the vomiting reflex.

51:44.980 --> 51:47.260
 If we have a very distended gut, we feel lousy,

51:47.260 --> 51:49.500
 it just, it actually can hurt very badly,

51:49.500 --> 51:51.540
 and we will have the desire to vomit,

51:51.540 --> 51:53.080
 or we will just simply vomit.

51:54.900 --> 51:56.540
 Mechanical and chemical signals

51:56.540 --> 51:58.340
 are always arriving in parallel.

51:58.340 --> 52:00.940
 They never work in unison.

52:00.940 --> 52:04.660
 And so now we have chemical signals, mechanical signals,

52:04.660 --> 52:07.560
 and now I'd like to talk about direct and indirect signals,

52:07.560 --> 52:10.580
 because almost everything I've talked about up until now

52:10.580 --> 52:12.380
 are direct signals, a neural pathway

52:12.380 --> 52:13.400
 that converges in the brain

52:13.400 --> 52:15.920
 to create a particular feeling, thought, or behavior,

52:15.920 --> 52:18.280
 but there are also indirect pathways.

52:18.280 --> 52:21.220
 And that's what takes us back to the gut microbiome

52:21.220 --> 52:22.860
 and to these little microbiota.

52:22.860 --> 52:26.180
 And to just give you the takeaway message at the front here,

52:26.180 --> 52:28.360
 and then I'll give you a little more detail

52:28.360 --> 52:29.620
 as to how it comes about.

52:30.740 --> 52:33.820
 You have neurotransmitters in your brain

52:33.820 --> 52:35.540
 and in your spinal cord and in your eyes

52:35.540 --> 52:37.220
 and in your peripheral nervous system.

52:37.220 --> 52:39.820
 They cause the activation or the suppression

52:39.820 --> 52:41.100
 of nerve activity,

52:41.100 --> 52:44.060
 meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells

52:44.060 --> 52:46.340
 or they cause other nerve cells to be less electrically

52:46.340 --> 52:49.100
 active, and they do that by way of neurotransmitters.

52:50.100 --> 52:53.240
 But as it turns out, the gut microbiota

52:53.240 --> 52:55.740
 are capable of influencing metabolic events

52:55.740 --> 52:57.340
 and in some cases are capable

52:57.340 --> 53:00.180
 of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves.

53:00.180 --> 53:02.500
 So what that means is that these little bugs,

53:02.500 --> 53:05.120
 these little microbiota that are cargo in your gut,

53:05.120 --> 53:06.740
 the six pounds of cargo,

53:06.740 --> 53:08.540
 they actually can make neurochemicals

53:08.540 --> 53:11.440
 that can pass into the bloodstream and into your brain

53:11.440 --> 53:13.220
 and actually impact the other cells

53:13.220 --> 53:15.540
 of your body and brain indirectly.

53:15.540 --> 53:18.080
 So without involving these very intricate nerve pathways

53:18.080 --> 53:19.700
 that we've been talking about.

53:19.700 --> 53:22.460
 In other words, the foods you eat,

53:23.460 --> 53:25.760
 the environment of your gut microbiome

53:25.760 --> 53:27.900
 can actually create the chemical substrates

53:27.900 --> 53:30.320
 that allow your brain to feel one way or the other,

53:30.320 --> 53:32.160
 to feel great or to feel lousy,

53:32.160 --> 53:34.900
 to seek out more of a particular type of behavior

53:34.900 --> 53:36.340
 or to avoid that behavior.

53:36.340 --> 53:38.760
 And that would constitute indirect signaling.

53:38.760 --> 53:40.460
 So I've been talking a lot about the structure

53:40.460 --> 53:42.980
 and function of the gut to brain pathway,

53:42.980 --> 53:45.840
 focusing mainly on feeding behaviors

53:45.840 --> 53:47.900
 and in some cases, avoiding feeding

53:47.900 --> 53:51.020
 or even ejecting food from the digestive tract.

53:51.020 --> 53:52.740
 I'd like to drill a little bit deeper

53:52.740 --> 53:55.100
 into this indirect signaling pathway

53:55.100 --> 53:56.320
 from the gut to the brain,

53:56.320 --> 54:00.060
 because it bridges us nicely from neuronal signals

54:00.060 --> 54:01.460
 in the gut to the brain,

54:01.460 --> 54:04.020
 hormonal signals from the gut to the brain,

54:04.020 --> 54:06.540
 to what also includes the microbiome,

54:06.540 --> 54:08.020
 which is what we started talking about

54:08.020 --> 54:09.620
 at the beginning of the episode.

54:09.620 --> 54:12.300
 As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,

54:14.240 --> 54:16.960
 certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize

54:16.960 --> 54:19.680
 certain neurotransmitters that can go impact the brain.

54:19.680 --> 54:22.880
 And we actually have some knowledge about which microbiota

54:22.880 --> 54:25.200
 can synthesize particular neurotransmitters.

54:25.200 --> 54:28.200
 For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine

54:28.200 --> 54:33.200
 can be synthesized by or from bacillus and serratia.

54:34.040 --> 54:36.260
 Now, these are just names of microbiota.

54:36.260 --> 54:37.720
 I don't expect that any of you

54:37.720 --> 54:39.040
 would necessarily recognize them.

54:39.040 --> 54:39.960
 These aren't the sorts of things

54:39.960 --> 54:41.520
 that you necessarily would have run out and buy

54:41.520 --> 54:43.160
 to get more dopamine.

54:43.160 --> 54:47.200
 But the point is that particular gut microbiota

54:47.200 --> 54:49.760
 can create dopamine in our gut

54:49.760 --> 54:51.320
 that can get into our bloodstream

54:51.320 --> 54:55.120
 and can generally change our baseline levels of dopamine

54:55.120 --> 54:57.280
 within the brain and other areas of the body.

54:58.160 --> 55:00.000
 I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine

55:00.000 --> 55:03.500
 because as I talked about on an episode all about dopamine,

55:03.500 --> 55:07.140
 but I'll just repeat the basics here now,

55:07.140 --> 55:09.860
 we have baseline levels of neurotransmitters

55:09.860 --> 55:13.600
 or neuromodulators that act as sort of the level of the tide

55:13.600 --> 55:16.840
 the overall level, and then we can have peaks of dopamine

55:16.840 --> 55:19.120
 that are created by behaviors or by ingestion

55:19.120 --> 55:21.660
 of particular foods or drugs, et cetera.

55:21.660 --> 55:25.360
 So bacillus and serratia tend to increase

55:25.360 --> 55:28.100
 our baseline levels of dopamine.

55:28.100 --> 55:30.860
 So if it turns out that we are creating

55:30.860 --> 55:33.760
 the right gut microbiome environment

55:33.760 --> 55:37.960
 that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in,

55:37.960 --> 55:41.340
 well then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated.

55:41.340 --> 55:43.840
 And in general, that leads to enhancement of mood.

55:44.860 --> 55:48.600
 Similarly, there are other gut microbiota,

55:48.600 --> 55:53.240
 for instance, candida, streptococcus, various enterococcus.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.920
 These always have these kind of strange

55:54.920 --> 55:56.540
 and not so attractive names,

55:56.540 --> 55:58.400
 at least to me as a neurobiologist.

55:58.400 --> 56:01.840
 Nonetheless, those particular microbiota

56:01.840 --> 56:04.120
 support the production of,

56:04.120 --> 56:07.640
 or can even be metabolized into serotonin,

56:07.640 --> 56:10.760
 which is a neuromodulator associated with mood,

56:10.760 --> 56:13.020
 with social interactions, with a huge number

56:13.020 --> 56:15.780
 of different types of events and behaviors.

56:15.780 --> 56:20.200
 Again, these gut microbiota when present

56:20.200 --> 56:22.000
 and allowed to thrive in our gut

56:22.000 --> 56:25.640
 will increase our overall levels of serotonin

56:25.640 --> 56:29.000
 and riding on top of that level of serotonin

56:29.000 --> 56:31.700
 will be the serotonin that's specifically released

56:31.700 --> 56:33.640
 in response to certain behaviors.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.920
 And I really want to drive home this point

56:35.920 --> 56:37.680
 of baselines and peaks.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.760
 The baseline level of serotonin might set our overall mood,

56:40.760 --> 56:43.260
 whether or not we wake up feeling pretty good

56:43.260 --> 56:45.760
 or really lousy if our serotonin levels

56:45.760 --> 56:47.380
 happen to be very, very low.

56:47.380 --> 56:50.100
 Whether or not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space

56:50.100 --> 56:52.480
 or whether or not we tend to be somewhat irritable.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.880
 But then of course, individual events,

56:54.880 --> 56:57.440
 as we go about our day, maybe a compliment that we get

56:57.440 --> 56:59.880
 or maybe somebody says something irritating to us,

56:59.880 --> 57:02.880
 whatever it may be, will also influence levels of serotonin.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.800
 But those serotonin events are going to be related

57:05.800 --> 57:08.880
 to events at particular neural circuits in the brain.

57:08.880 --> 57:10.480
 And this is an important topic

57:10.480 --> 57:14.100
 because I think that a lot of people hear quite accurately,

57:14.100 --> 57:18.420
 oh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin is manufactured in the gut.

57:18.420 --> 57:19.280
 And indeed that's true.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.760
 It's manufactured from the sorts of microbiota

57:21.760 --> 57:23.680
 that I just described.

57:23.680 --> 57:25.140
 And there are many, many experiments now,

57:25.140 --> 57:28.000
 mostly in animal models, but also some in humans

57:28.000 --> 57:31.140
 that show that if the gut microbiome is deficient

57:31.140 --> 57:34.880
 in some way to these particular bacteria,

57:34.880 --> 57:37.420
 that serotonin levels drop and people's mood suffers,

57:37.420 --> 57:39.480
 maybe even their immune system functions,

57:39.480 --> 57:42.380
 maybe even exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.620
 However, a lot of people take that to mean

57:45.620 --> 57:50.120
 that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut

57:50.120 --> 57:51.560
 or mostly comes from the gut.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.380
 That's not the case.

57:52.380 --> 57:54.840
 It's still the case that you have neurons in the brain

57:54.840 --> 57:57.820
 that are responsible for releasing their serotonin directly

57:57.820 --> 58:00.160
 in response to certain things like social touch

58:00.160 --> 58:04.120
 or through other types of positive social experiences.

58:04.120 --> 58:07.540
 So we've got gut microbiota

58:07.540 --> 58:10.040
 that can literally be turned into dopamine

58:10.040 --> 58:11.800
 and raise our baseline levels of dopamine.

58:11.800 --> 58:12.980
 We've got gut microbiota

58:12.980 --> 58:16.360
 that can literally raise our baseline levels of serotonin.

58:16.360 --> 58:18.380
 And indeed there are other gut microbiota

58:18.380 --> 58:21.380
 like lactobacillus or bifidobacterium,

58:23.920 --> 58:27.420
 hard complex names to pronounce, bifidobacterium

58:27.420 --> 58:30.880
 that can give rise to increases in GABA levels,

58:30.880 --> 58:32.360
 this inhibitory neurotransmitter

58:32.360 --> 58:34.760
 that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative

58:34.760 --> 58:37.240
 can reduce irritability, et cetera.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.920
 But that's just the baseline,

58:38.920 --> 58:41.280
 the kind of tide of those neuromodulators.

58:41.280 --> 58:43.680
 Again, I want to emphasize that we still have neural circuits

58:43.680 --> 58:46.380
 within the brain and body that are specifically releasing

58:46.380 --> 58:50.080
 in a very potent way, dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.

58:50.080 --> 58:52.280
 So the two things act in concert.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.680
 Even though the gut and the brain are acting

58:54.680 --> 58:59.120
 both in parallel and directly influencing one another,

58:59.120 --> 59:01.840
 it is a powerful synergistic effect.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.240
 And there are now hundreds of studies,

59:04.240 --> 59:06.840
 maybe even thousands by this point,

59:06.840 --> 59:10.360
 mostly performed in animal models, typically mice,

59:10.360 --> 59:12.260
 but also some studies in humans

59:12.260 --> 59:15.560
 that show that creating the correct environment

59:15.560 --> 59:17.320
 for these gut microbiota to thrive

59:17.320 --> 59:20.560
 really does enhance mood and wellbeing.

59:20.560 --> 59:25.200
 And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy,

59:25.200 --> 59:28.780
 that it really can deplete our mood and sense of wellbeing.

59:28.780 --> 59:31.520
 Now, there are two major phases

59:31.520 --> 59:33.920
 to creating a healthy gut microbiome.

59:33.920 --> 59:35.560
 One you can control,

59:35.560 --> 59:38.620
 and the other one is less under your control.

59:38.620 --> 59:40.840
 I get into this in a lot of detail

59:40.840 --> 59:42.760
 in the episode with Dr. Sonnenberg,

59:42.760 --> 59:46.520
 which is coming out immediately after this one,

59:46.520 --> 59:48.500
 the following Monday, that is.

59:48.500 --> 59:51.040
 But for now, I want to just capture

59:51.040 --> 59:54.200
 a few of the main points about the early establishment

59:54.200 --> 59:55.440
 of the gut microbiome.

59:56.680 --> 1:00:01.060
 It turns out that the environment that we are exposed to,

1:00:01.060 --> 1:00:02.800
 the things that come into contact with our skin

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:05.440
 and digestive tract and any other mucosal lining,

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:08.380
 even the urethra, the nasal passages,

1:00:08.380 --> 1:00:10.160
 any opening to the outside world

1:00:10.980 --> 1:00:13.600
 that brings in certain, excuse me,

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:17.800
 certain microbiota in the first three years of life

1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:20.100
 is going to have a profound impact

1:00:20.100 --> 1:00:22.920
 on the overall menu of microbiota

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:27.280
 that we will be able to carry within our body.

1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.320
 And it really does seem that getting exposure to

1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:32.320
 and building a diverse microbiome

1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:34.880
 in those first three years is critical.

1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:37.560
 There's a lot of speculation and some data

1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:40.520
 as to cesarean delivered babies

1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:43.120
 having less diverse microbiomes

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:44.760
 compared to vaginally delivered babies.

1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:48.000
 There have been attempts, although not conclusive attempts,

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.640
 to link that to the presence of autism spectrum disorders,

1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:53.600
 which at least by some statistics

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.780
 seem to be of higher probability in cesarean deliveries.

1:00:57.780 --> 1:01:00.440
 Although there are other studies that refute that,

1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:01.940
 and I want to make that clear.

1:01:03.100 --> 1:01:06.240
 However, it's clear that babies do not get much,

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:10.480
 if any, exposure to microbiota inside of the womb.

1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:11.920
 Maybe a little bit, but not much.

1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:13.680
 But that is during the birth process

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:17.240
 and in the days and weeks immediately after

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:18.740
 they arrive in the world,

1:01:18.740 --> 1:01:20.880
 that their gut microbiome is established,

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:24.360
 that those gut microbiota take residence within the gut.

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.840
 So it will depend on whether or not

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:27.360
 they were breastfed or bottle fed.

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:28.540
 It will depend on whether or not

1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:30.780
 they were exposed to a household pet or not,

1:01:30.780 --> 1:01:33.360
 whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:36.200
 or just by one, whether or not they were a preemie baby

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:39.680
 and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:41.520
 in order to encourage their further development

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:43.700
 before they could be brought home or not.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:46.700
 I don't want to give the picture that if you were isolated

1:01:46.700 --> 1:01:48.760
 or you were delivered by C-section

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:50.800
 that you're somehow doomed to have a poor microbiome.

1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:52.520
 That's simply not the case.

1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:56.880
 However, it is the case that the more diversity of microbiota

1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:01.880
 that one can create early in life is really helpful

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:06.420
 for long-term outcomes in terms of brain to gut signaling,

1:02:06.420 --> 1:02:07.840
 gut to brain signaling,

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:11.800
 and for sake of the immune system.

1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:14.960
 There are some decent studies showing that

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:18.340
 if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment

1:02:18.340 --> 1:02:21.040
 early in life, that can be very detrimental

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:23.760
 to establishment of a healthy gut microbiome.

1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:27.240
 And fortunately, that reestablishing a healthy gut microbiome

1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:29.680
 can help rescue some of those deficits.

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:32.520
 So doctors nowadays are much more cautious

1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:35.180
 about the prescription of antibiotic drugs

1:02:35.180 --> 1:02:37.120
 to children in their early years,

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:38.240
 not just up to three years,

1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:40.960
 but extending out to five and seven and 10 years.

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:44.580
 And even in adults, they're very, very careful about that,

1:02:44.580 --> 1:02:46.120
 or they ought to be.

1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:49.320
 One reason is the existence, or I would say

1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:52.940
 the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria

1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:55.760
 that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere,

1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:57.500
 and that can cause serious problems.

1:02:57.500 --> 1:02:59.720
 But in addition to that, because of this understanding

1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:02.400
 that the gut microbiome is influencing

1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:03.980
 and actually creating neurotransmitters

1:03:03.980 --> 1:03:05.980
 that can impact mood and mental health,

1:03:05.980 --> 1:03:08.140
 impact immune health, and so on.

1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:09.760
 As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds,

1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:11.640
 if not thousands of studies

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:14.020
 emphasizing the key role of the microbiome

1:03:14.020 --> 1:03:18.040
 on brain health, psychiatric health, et cetera.

1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:20.560
 I want to just highlight a few of those studies,

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:23.880
 and in particular, some recent studies that come from labs

1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:25.040
 that have been working on this sort of thing

1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:26.600
 for a very long time.

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:28.000
 One of the more exciting studies

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.080
 comes from the work of Mauro Costa-Matioli's lab,

1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:33.200
 which is at Baylor College of Medicine.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:36.160
 Mauro's lab has been working on mouse models

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:39.140
 of autism spectrum disorder for a long time,

1:03:39.140 --> 1:03:41.280
 and looking at social behavior,

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:43.520
 using a mouse model for a long time.

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:46.220
 And they've been able to identify

1:03:46.220 --> 1:03:49.020
 particular types of microbiota

1:03:49.020 --> 1:03:52.440
 that when they take resonance in the gut

1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:56.480
 can help offset some of the symptoms of autism,

1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:57.840
 at least the symptoms of autism

1:03:57.840 --> 1:03:59.500
 that exist in these mouse models, okay?

1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:01.400
 So again, this is not human work.

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:03.000
 This is work being done on mouse models

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.020
 for the simple reason

1:04:04.020 --> 1:04:06.040
 that you can do these kinds of manipulations,

1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:07.880
 where basically they took mice

1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.280
 that were in germ-free environments

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.580
 or non-germ-free environments,

1:04:11.580 --> 1:04:13.960
 or they exposed mice to particular microbiota

1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:15.560
 and not other microbiota,

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:18.680
 and they discovered that a particular microbiota

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:23.680
 called L-reuteri, it's L period, R-E-U-T-E-R-I,

1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:26.760
 treatment with L-reuteri

1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:30.160
 corrects the social deficits present in these autism models.

1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:32.920
 And it does so by way of activating our old friend,

1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:34.300
 the vagus nerve,

1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:36.560
 but not simply because the vagus nerve

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:38.240
 triggers the release of dopamine,

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:41.120
 but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota,

1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:43.640
 L-reuteri, can correct the social deficits

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:45.960
 in this autism spectrum disorder model.

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:48.240
 It does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway

1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.940
 that stimulates both dopamine release

1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:50.980
 and oxytocin release.

1:04:50.980 --> 1:04:52.960
 And they established this really mechanistically

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:53.800
 by showing, for instance,

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:55.880
 if you get rid of the oxytocin receptor,

1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:57.480
 you don't see this rescue.

1:04:57.480 --> 1:04:58.640
 Now, those are mouse models,

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:01.720
 so we have to take those with the appropriate grain of salt,

1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:02.780
 but they're really exciting.

1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:06.080
 And they come to us in parallel

1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:07.760
 with other studies that are being done,

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:11.120
 taking the microbiomes of people

1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:13.760
 who have one condition or lack of condition

1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:15.240
 and putting it into people

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.400
 who have one condition or another condition.

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.160
 Let me explain what I mean by that.

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.320
 The early discovery of the gut microbiome

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:25.240
 and its potential to impact health

1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:28.480
 was not in the context of the gut to brain pathway,

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.800
 but rather it was in the context of colitis.

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.320
 This dates back to studies in the 50s,

1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:36.920
 whereby people with very severe intractable colitis

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:39.120
 for which no other treatment was going to work

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:40.840
 received fecal transplants.

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:42.720
 So yes, that's exactly as it sounds,

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:44.880
 taking the stool of healthy people

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:46.120
 who do not have colitis,

1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:49.560
 transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.360
 of people who do have colitis,

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:53.880
 and they saw significant improvement

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:55.940
 if not rescue of the colitis.

1:05:55.940 --> 1:05:57.420
 That was one of the first indications

1:05:57.420 --> 1:06:00.800
 that something within stool of all things

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:04.720
 could actually rescue another individual from disease,

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:07.040
 which sounds kind of wild and crazy

1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:09.380
 and may even sound disgusting to some of you,

1:06:09.380 --> 1:06:12.920
 but as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:17.920
 almost 60% of stool is live or dead bacteria, microbiota,

1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:21.740
 and it really opened up this entire field

1:06:21.740 --> 1:06:24.180
 of exploring how different microbiota

1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:26.360
 might have therapeutic effects.

1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:28.900
 And indeed that has been shown to be the case

1:06:28.900 --> 1:06:32.900
 also in fecal transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses.

1:06:32.900 --> 1:06:35.280
 These are still ongoing studies.

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:36.720
 They vary in quality.

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:40.380
 These are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons,

1:06:40.380 --> 1:06:42.120
 getting the appropriate patient populations,

1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:43.540
 getting agreement, et cetera,

1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:46.800
 making sure that everything's handled properly.

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:49.340
 But what this involves is fecal transplants

1:06:49.340 --> 1:06:53.160
 from individuals that lack a particular psychiatric condition

1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:54.440
 or metabolic condition

1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:57.960
 into people who have a particular metabolic condition.

1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:00.680
 And there has been tremendous success in some cases.

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:03.600
 One of the more powerful and salient examples

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:04.960
 is for obesity.

1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:06.060
 There are some people for which,

1:07:06.060 --> 1:07:09.420
 even if they ingest very low numbers of calories,

1:07:09.420 --> 1:07:11.440
 even if they go on a liquid protein diet,

1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:13.560
 simply can't lose weight.

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:14.920
 These are somewhat rare disorders,

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:16.960
 but these are people that would either do,

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:18.320
 get gastric bypass surgery.

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:20.380
 Some people are now getting these fecal transplants

1:07:20.380 --> 1:07:25.380
 from people that have healthy weight

1:07:25.380 --> 1:07:28.480
 and they take the stool from them,

1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:30.400
 they put it into lower digestive tract,

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:34.360
 and they can see substantial improvement in weight loss

1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:36.720
 in people that were otherwise unable to do that.

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:37.960
 In some cases, actually,

1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:40.340
 they can start eating relatively normal levels of food

1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:41.240
 and still lose weight.

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:42.260
 So pretty remarkable.

1:07:42.260 --> 1:07:44.480
 And that tells us there's something in these microbiota

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:45.860
 that's really powerful.

1:07:45.860 --> 1:07:49.120
 Now, how those effects are generated isn't clear.

1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:53.160
 One idea is that it's impacting the metabolome

1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:54.600
 components of the metabolism.

1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:56.580
 Almost certainly that's going to be the case.

1:07:56.580 --> 1:07:59.380
 Another idea is that it's impacting neurotransmitters,

1:07:59.380 --> 1:08:02.440
 which change behavior and food choices within the brain.

1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:03.280
 Although, as I mentioned,

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:05.660
 some of these people are already eating very little food

1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:06.720
 to begin with.

1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:10.720
 So that's a little bit harder of an argument to create.

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:13.180
 There are also some somewhat famous examples now

1:08:13.180 --> 1:08:16.780
 of how fecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes.

1:08:16.780 --> 1:08:19.420
 But those negative outcomes further underscore

1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:23.300
 the power of the microbiome in impacting bodily health.

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:26.700
 One key example of this, for instance,

1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:31.040
 is transfer of fecal matter into another person

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:33.220
 in order to treat something like colitis.

1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:35.840
 And it effectively does that.

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:39.620
 But if the donor of the stool of the fecal matter

1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:43.700
 happened to be obese or have some other metabolic syndrome,

1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:45.420
 it's been observed that the recipient

1:08:45.420 --> 1:08:47.900
 can also develop that metabolic syndrome

1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:51.700
 simply by way of receiving that donor's

1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:53.260
 particular microbiota.

1:08:53.260 --> 1:08:55.820
 So these microbiota can create positive outcomes

1:08:55.820 --> 1:08:57.960
 or they can create negative outcomes.

1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.280
 Now, most of us, of course, are not interested in

1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:01.740
 or pursuing fecal transplants.

1:09:01.740 --> 1:09:03.540
 Most people are interested in just creating

1:09:03.540 --> 1:09:05.720
 a healthy gut microbiome environment

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:07.540
 for sake of immune system and brain function.

1:09:07.540 --> 1:09:09.080
 And we will talk about how to do that

1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.700
 in just a few minutes.

1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:13.420
 But I just want to further underscore

1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:17.940
 the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry

1:09:17.940 --> 1:09:20.140
 and in shaping things like mood

1:09:20.140 --> 1:09:21.500
 or other aspects of mental health

1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:24.440
 that typically we don't associate with our gut.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.740
 There are several studies published in recent years.

1:09:26.740 --> 1:09:28.220
 One that I'll just highlight now,

1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:32.460
 first author, it's Tanya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:35.180
 The title of the paper is Association of Loneliness

1:09:35.180 --> 1:09:38.820
 and Wisdom with Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition,

1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:40.280
 an exploratory study.

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:43.960
 It's an interesting study looked at 184 community dwelling

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:48.960
 of adults, excuse me, ranging from 28 to 97 years old.

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:52.100
 They explored whether or not

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:54.580
 having enhanced microbial diversity

1:09:54.580 --> 1:09:56.760
 somehow related to these variables

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.580
 that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom.

1:09:58.580 --> 1:10:02.140
 They used a number of different tests to evaluate those.

1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:04.620
 Those are common tests in the psychology literature,

1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:06.380
 not so much in the biology literature,

1:10:06.380 --> 1:10:08.900
 but nonetheless, there are ways of measuring things

1:10:08.900 --> 1:10:10.800
 like loneliness and wisdom.

1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:16.500
 Wisdom in this case being the opposite of loneliness,

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:18.060
 at least in the context of this study.

1:10:18.060 --> 1:10:20.660
 And what they found was the more microbial diversity,

1:10:20.660 --> 1:10:22.940
 the more diverse one's microbiome was,

1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:25.840
 the lower incidence of loneliness.

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:28.100
 And they did this by taking fecal samples,

1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:29.500
 profiling them for RNA.

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:31.640
 So essentially doing gene sequencing of the stool,

1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:32.760
 of these individuals,

1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:35.720
 getting ratings of how lonely or not lonely they felt

1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:37.020
 and correlating those.

1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:38.720
 And that's just but one study.

1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:41.180
 I pointed out because it's particularly recent

1:10:41.180 --> 1:10:43.620
 and it looked like it was particularly well done.

1:10:43.620 --> 1:10:45.580
 There is another study that I'll just refer you to.

1:10:45.580 --> 1:10:49.240
 This was a study published in 2020 in Scientific Reports.

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:51.080
 The title of the study is emotional wellbeing

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:54.220
 and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.

1:10:54.220 --> 1:10:55.740
 What I particularly like about this study

1:10:55.740 --> 1:10:57.780
 is that they were able to correlate the presence

1:10:57.780 --> 1:10:59.900
 of certain microbiota

1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:02.620
 with feelings of subjective wellbeing

1:11:02.620 --> 1:11:05.140
 and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms.

1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:08.780
 They did high throughput gene sequencing

1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:10.540
 of the microbiomes of individuals.

1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:13.440
 So that meant measuring the microbiota,

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.660
 figuring out which microbiota were present,

1:11:15.660 --> 1:11:18.060
 how diverse their microbiome was in general,

1:11:18.060 --> 1:11:20.780
 gut microbiome diversity is a good thing.

1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:22.340
 And then to correlate that

1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:26.220
 with what's called the PANAS score.

1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:29.880
 PANAS stands for positive affect, negative affect schedule.

1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:31.900
 This is a test that my lab has used extensively

1:11:31.900 --> 1:11:34.860
 that other labs use to evaluate mood and wellbeing.

1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:38.620
 And they defined what were called three enterotypes,

1:11:38.620 --> 1:11:40.100
 three different categories of people

1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:42.140
 that ate very different diets

1:11:42.140 --> 1:11:44.040
 that tended to fall into categories

1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:48.080
 of having more or fewer emotional symptoms

1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:48.920
 that were negative

1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:52.040
 or more or fewer emotional symptoms that were positive,

1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:55.260
 and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious,

1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:57.740
 or have more stress-related behaviors, et cetera.

1:11:57.740 --> 1:12:00.980
 And what they were able to derive from this study

1:12:00.980 --> 1:12:02.760
 was some strong indications

1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:05.940
 about what types of things we should ingest in our diet,

1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:07.700
 maybe even certain things that we should avoid,

1:12:07.700 --> 1:12:10.100
 but certainly the types of things that we should ingest

1:12:10.100 --> 1:12:12.420
 that can enhance mood and wellbeing

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:14.620
 and can tend to shift people away

1:12:14.620 --> 1:12:16.820
 from more depressive-like anxiety

1:12:16.820 --> 1:12:18.240
 and stress-related symptoms.

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:20.940
 Before we get into what the particular food items were

1:12:20.940 --> 1:12:23.740
 that lend themselves to a healthy microbiome,

1:12:23.740 --> 1:12:25.740
 I want to raise a bigger and perhaps more important issue,

1:12:25.740 --> 1:12:28.480
 which is what is a healthy microbiome?

1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:32.060
 I think if you asked any number of world experts,

1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:33.880
 and I certainly ask this of Dr. Sonnenberg,

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.460
 what is a healthy microbiome?

1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:36.400
 They're all going to tell you

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.940
 it's a microbiome that has a lot of diversity,

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:42.140
 that includes a lot of different types of bacteria.

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:43.100
 And that makes sense

1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:46.460
 because it logically would include the bacteria

1:12:46.460 --> 1:12:48.860
 that produce GABA and dopamine and serotonin

1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:50.420
 and that support the immune system

1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:51.900
 and do a number of different things.

1:12:51.900 --> 1:12:54.140
 But is it simply the case

1:12:54.140 --> 1:12:58.420
 that adding microbiota diversity is always a good thing?

1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:02.180
 Well, that doesn't seem to be the case.

1:13:02.180 --> 1:13:04.020
 Probiotics and prebiotics,

1:13:04.020 --> 1:13:06.980
 both of which can enhance microbiota diversity,

1:13:06.980 --> 1:13:10.660
 can improve mood digestion, immune system, and so on.

1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:11.760
 That's been established,

1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:12.900
 but it's mainly been established

1:13:12.900 --> 1:13:15.880
 in the context of post-antibiotic treatment

1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:17.720
 or people that are recovering from illness

1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:20.900
 or people that have been very stressed

1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:24.020
 or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges,

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:25.260
 mental or physical,

1:13:25.260 --> 1:13:28.900
 and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome.

1:13:28.900 --> 1:13:33.900
 However, it's also clear that excessive microbiota

1:13:35.420 --> 1:13:38.700
 brought about by excessive intake of probiotics

1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:40.240
 can lead to things like brain fog.

1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:41.820
 There's actually some good studies

1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:44.520
 that point to the fact that certain metabolites

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.380
 of the microbiome,

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:49.480
 certain chemicals produced in the gut and in the body,

1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:51.840
 can actually lead to brain fog states.

1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:52.840
 This is thought to come about

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:55.860
 through the lactate pathways of the gut

1:13:55.860 --> 1:13:57.960
 that can then impact the brain.

1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:00.100
 If you want to look more into this issue

1:14:00.100 --> 1:14:04.340
 of whether or not probiotics taken in excess, perhaps,

1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:06.500
 can lead to brain fog,

1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:08.340
 I'd encourage you to look at a particular paper.

1:14:08.340 --> 1:14:09.300
 This is a paper published

1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:12.780
 in Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology,

1:14:12.780 --> 1:14:13.620
 and the title of the paper

1:14:13.620 --> 1:14:15.580
 is Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,

1:14:15.580 --> 1:14:19.580
 a link between SIBO probiotics and metabolic acidosis.

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:20.780
 It was published in 2018.

1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:22.420
 We can provide a link to this study.

1:14:22.420 --> 1:14:25.560
 And there are several other studies in the references

1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:29.900
 that point to the fact that in some cases,

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:31.540
 excessive intake of probiotics

1:14:31.540 --> 1:14:33.740
 and excessive proliferation of gut microbiota

1:14:33.740 --> 1:14:35.180
 can actually be problematic.

1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:37.740
 I mention this not to confuse you,

1:14:37.740 --> 1:14:41.100
 but because it is confusing out there.

1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:42.900
 We all would think that just increasing

1:14:42.900 --> 1:14:45.760
 microbiota diversity is always a good thing,

1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:47.940
 but there are thresholds

1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:50.780
 beyond which excessive microbiota diversity

1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:52.020
 might be problematic.

1:14:52.020 --> 1:14:53.020
 I think everyone agrees

1:14:53.020 --> 1:14:57.820
 that having too few microbial species living in us

1:14:57.820 --> 1:14:59.440
 is not a good idea.

1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:01.040
 Now, none of that answers the questions

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:03.940
 that I think everyone really wants answers to,

1:15:03.940 --> 1:15:06.420
 which are what should we do?

1:15:06.420 --> 1:15:09.280
 What should we not do to improve our gut microbiome?

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:11.760
 I mean, clearly we can't time travel back

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:13.980
 to when we were zero to three years old

1:15:13.980 --> 1:15:16.740
 and get a dog if we didn't have a dog,

1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:18.880
 get breastfed if we weren't breastfed,

1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:21.580
 be delivered vaginally as opposed to by C-section

1:15:21.580 --> 1:15:23.260
 if we didn't have that opportunity,

1:15:23.260 --> 1:15:25.260
 we just can't time travel and do that.

1:15:25.260 --> 1:15:26.700
 All of us, however, should be seeking

1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:29.340
 to improve the conditions of our gut microbiome

1:15:29.340 --> 1:15:30.580
 because of the critical ways

1:15:30.580 --> 1:15:33.140
 in which it impacts the rest of our brain

1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:34.660
 and bodily health.

1:15:34.660 --> 1:15:35.500
 So what should we do?

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:36.460
 What shouldn't we do?

1:15:36.460 --> 1:15:37.840
 Clearly we know that stress

1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:40.080
 can negatively impact the gut microbiome.

1:15:41.060 --> 1:15:44.000
 However, some forms of stress that can quote unquote,

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.220
 negatively impact the microbiome include fasting,

1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:49.240
 long periods of fast, which makes sense

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:52.860
 because a lot of microbiota need food in order to thrive.

1:15:52.860 --> 1:15:55.820
 In fact, many, if not all of them do at some point.

1:15:57.500 --> 1:15:59.460
 There are other questions such as,

1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:00.980
 should we eat particular foods

1:16:00.980 --> 1:16:02.960
 and how often should we eat those foods?

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:05.940
 We've all been told that fiber is incredibly important

1:16:05.940 --> 1:16:08.680
 because of the presence of prebiotic fiber,

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.660
 which can essentially feed the microbiome,

1:16:11.660 --> 1:16:15.000
 but is fiber really necessary?

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.940
 And how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microbiome?

1:16:17.940 --> 1:16:19.380
 Clearly there are a number of people

1:16:19.380 --> 1:16:21.620
 following relatively low fiber diets,

1:16:21.620 --> 1:16:22.900
 such as ketogenic diets,

1:16:22.900 --> 1:16:26.700
 and those can have in some cases anti-inflammatory effects

1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:31.060
 and can sometimes also improve certain microbiota species.

1:16:31.060 --> 1:16:32.460
 So it can all be rather confusing.

1:16:32.460 --> 1:16:35.900
 And for that matter, I asked our resident expert,

1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:39.820
 Dr. Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford, all of these questions.

1:16:39.820 --> 1:16:43.020
 And he answers them very systematically in the episode

1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:45.020
 that comes out after this one.

1:16:45.020 --> 1:16:46.660
 But I don't want to withhold anything from you.

1:16:46.660 --> 1:16:49.300
 So I'll just give a very top contour version

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:50.140
 of those answers,

1:16:50.140 --> 1:16:52.540
 and then you'll get more in-depth answers

1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:54.180
 during that episode.

1:16:54.180 --> 1:16:55.440
 I asked about fasting.

1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:57.860
 And the reason I asked about fasting is that years ago,

1:16:57.860 --> 1:16:58.860
 I was at a meeting

1:16:58.860 --> 1:17:02.140
 as part of the Pew Biomedical Scholars meeting.

1:17:02.140 --> 1:17:05.620
 And one of the other Pew Biomedical Scholars

1:17:05.620 --> 1:17:07.220
 was an expert in gut microbiome.

1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:11.580
 And I said, hey, are probiotics good for the microbiome?

1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:14.220
 And if so, which one should I take?

1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:15.500
 And his answer was very interesting.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.460
 He said, you know, in certain cases they can be,

1:17:18.460 --> 1:17:21.280
 especially if you're traveling or you're stressed,

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:24.800
 but it turns out that the particular bacteria

1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:26.720
 that they put in most probiotics

1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:30.700
 don't actually replenish the microbiota that you need most.

1:17:30.700 --> 1:17:32.940
 And I thought, oh, well, why don't they make ones

1:17:32.940 --> 1:17:35.620
 that replenish the microbiota that you need most?

1:17:35.620 --> 1:17:39.240
 And his answer was, well, they don't replenish those,

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:42.660
 but they replenish other ones that then in turn

1:17:42.660 --> 1:17:45.300
 encourage the development of the microbiota

1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:46.920
 that you do want once you start eating

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:47.920
 the appropriate foods.

1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:49.280
 So they changed the environment,

1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:50.480
 which makes the environment better,

1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:53.300
 which indirectly supports the proliferation

1:17:53.300 --> 1:17:55.580
 of quote unquote good microbiota.

1:17:55.580 --> 1:17:57.480
 Okay, so that was a somewhat convoluted answer,

1:17:57.480 --> 1:17:58.980
 but I did appreciate his answer.

1:17:58.980 --> 1:18:00.700
 Then I asked him about fasting.

1:18:00.700 --> 1:18:02.820
 I said, well, a lot of people are getting interested

1:18:02.820 --> 1:18:04.740
 in intermittent fasting now.

1:18:04.740 --> 1:18:06.900
 People are spending a significant portion

1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:08.900
 of each 24 hour cycle avoiding food

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:10.340
 for sake of time restricted feeding.

1:18:10.340 --> 1:18:11.780
 What does that do to the gut microbiome?

1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:14.480
 Does it make it healthier or does it make it unhealthier?

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:17.940
 Well, my colleague from Yale and Dr. Sonnenberg

1:18:17.940 --> 1:18:20.420
 both confirmed that during periods of fasting,

1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:22.420
 especially prolonged periods of fasting,

1:18:22.420 --> 1:18:23.940
 we actually start to digest away

1:18:23.940 --> 1:18:26.020
 much of our digestive tract.

1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:28.020
 Now, the whole thing doesn't start to disappear,

1:18:28.020 --> 1:18:29.860
 but there's thinning of the mucosal lining

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:31.820
 or at least disruption of the mucosal lining.

1:18:31.820 --> 1:18:35.340
 A lot of the microbiota species can start to die off.

1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:37.340
 And so it was surprising to me,

1:18:37.340 --> 1:18:39.620
 but nonetheless interesting that fasting

1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:44.020
 may actually cause a disruption to certain healthy elements

1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:45.260
 of the gut microbiome.

1:18:46.100 --> 1:18:47.400
 But again, there's a caveat.

1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:52.060
 The caveat is that when people eat after a period of fast,

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:55.080
 there may be a compensatory proliferation,

1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:58.220
 meaning an increase in healthy gut microbiota.

1:18:58.220 --> 1:18:59.420
 So you start to get the picture

1:18:59.420 --> 1:19:02.060
 that fasting is neither good nor bad.

1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:04.780
 You start to get the picture that particular diets,

1:19:04.780 --> 1:19:07.700
 meaning certain restriction diets

1:19:07.700 --> 1:19:10.660
 or macronutrient rich diets may not be good or bad

1:19:10.660 --> 1:19:11.740
 for the microbiome.

1:19:11.740 --> 1:19:15.500
 And yet there are some answers that arrive to us

1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:18.420
 from Dr. Sonnenberg, but from other experts in the field,

1:19:18.420 --> 1:19:20.920
 that there are certain foods

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:22.560
 and certain things that we can ingest,

1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:25.460
 which definitely enhance the microbiome

1:19:25.460 --> 1:19:27.620
 and make it healthier than it would be

1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:30.080
 were we to not ingest those foods.

1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:31.680
 So next I'd like to talk about

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:33.420
 what I think is a really pioneering

1:19:33.420 --> 1:19:35.180
 and important study in this area.

1:19:35.180 --> 1:19:38.660
 This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenberg lab

1:19:38.660 --> 1:19:41.060
 in collaboration with Chris Gardner's lab,

1:19:41.060 --> 1:19:43.780
 also at Stanford, where they compared

1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:47.120
 two general types of diets in humans,

1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:49.180
 diets that were fiber rich,

1:19:49.180 --> 1:19:51.460
 which has been proposed time and time again

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:54.260
 to enhance microbiota diversity

1:19:54.260 --> 1:19:56.460
 and to enhance gut brain signaling even

1:19:56.460 --> 1:19:59.220
 and to enhance the immune system, perhaps,

1:19:59.220 --> 1:20:01.200
 and diets that were enriched

1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:04.020
 in so-called low sugar fermented foods.

1:20:04.020 --> 1:20:06.840
 Before I dive into that study and what the conclusions were,

1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:07.980
 because they are very interesting

1:20:07.980 --> 1:20:10.060
 and very actionable for all of us,

1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:12.320
 I do want to touch on probiotics

1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:14.680
 because I want to avoid confusion.

1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:18.480
 It is not the case that ingestion of probiotics

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.180
 will always lead to brain fog.

1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:21.920
 I want to make that clear.

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:24.700
 It is the case that ingestion of probiotics,

1:20:24.700 --> 1:20:28.320
 even if those probiotics don't directly contain

1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:31.600
 the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate,

1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:35.840
 can be useful for improving microbiota diversity.

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:38.900
 In general, it seems that maintaining

1:20:38.900 --> 1:20:41.940
 a healthy gut microbiome involves ingesting

1:20:41.940 --> 1:20:42.980
 certain types of foods,

1:20:42.980 --> 1:20:45.520
 and we'll talk about those in a moment,

1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:50.040
 but perhaps also augmenting the microbiota system

1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:52.500
 through prebiotics or probiotics

1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:54.820
 at a fairly low level on a consistent basis.

1:20:54.820 --> 1:20:56.500
 So these are not high dose probiotics

1:20:56.500 --> 1:21:00.260
 except under conditions of dysbiosis,

1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:01.260
 where, for instance,

1:21:01.260 --> 1:21:04.340
 if somebody has done a round of antibiotics

1:21:04.340 --> 1:21:07.060
 and they need to replenish their gut microbiome,

1:21:07.060 --> 1:21:09.380
 there are foods and there are pill form

1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:11.940
 and powder form prebiotics and probiotics

1:21:11.940 --> 1:21:13.140
 that can be very useful,

1:21:14.140 --> 1:21:17.020
 or in cases where people have been very stressed

1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:19.500
 or are undergoing excessive travel

1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:22.540
 or have shifted their diet radically,

1:21:22.540 --> 1:21:24.560
 maybe that's due to travel, maybe that's due to illness,

1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:26.020
 maybe that's due to stress,

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:28.600
 but when there are a number of different converging events

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:33.600
 that are stressing or depleting microbiota diversity,

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:35.340
 that's when, at least I believe,

1:21:35.340 --> 1:21:37.900
 it can be useful to support the gut microbiome

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:41.980
 through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics.

1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:45.340
 So it would be under conditions where people are stressed

1:21:45.340 --> 1:21:47.740
 or their system is generally stressed

1:21:47.740 --> 1:21:50.680
 for environmental or illness-related reasons,

1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:54.060
 that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses

1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:57.780
 of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use,

1:21:57.780 --> 1:21:59.680
 but that under normal conditions,

1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:04.620
 that one would focus on quality nutrients through diet

1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:08.460
 and focus on ingestion of probiotics

1:22:08.460 --> 1:22:11.260
 at a fairly low to moderate level

1:22:11.260 --> 1:22:15.020
 and or prebiotics at a fairly low to moderate level.

1:22:15.020 --> 1:22:16.720
 That just seems like the logical approach

1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:18.960
 based on the experts that I've spoken to,

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:22.140
 but certainly if your doctor prescribes

1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:24.580
 or suggests that you take high levels of probiotics

1:22:24.580 --> 1:22:25.600
 for any reason,

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.180
 you should definitely pay attention to your physician

1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:29.220
 and you should obviously pay attention to your physician.

1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:32.360
 In any case, you should never add or remove anything

1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:34.980
 from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan

1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:37.100
 without consulting a physician.

1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:39.500
 So what should we do in order to maximize the health

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:42.100
 of our gut brain axis, as it's called?

1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:45.880
 How should we support the diversity of the good microbiota

1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:47.820
 that help us create all these neurotransmitters

1:22:47.820 --> 1:22:52.020
 that we want, improve our immune system function,

1:22:52.020 --> 1:22:53.860
 and so on and so forth?

1:22:53.860 --> 1:22:57.700
 Well, some of that is going to be through the basics.

1:22:57.700 --> 1:22:59.720
 When I say the basics, I mean the foundational things

1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:02.220
 that really set us up for overall health.

1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:05.260
 So this is going to be getting deep sleep

1:23:05.260 --> 1:23:09.600
 of sufficient duration 80 plus percent of the time.

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:11.340
 I mean, if you could get 100% of the time, that'd be great,

1:23:11.340 --> 1:23:12.940
 but very few people accomplish that.

1:23:12.940 --> 1:23:14.220
 It's going to be proper hydration.

1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:16.100
 It's going to be proper social interactions.

1:23:16.100 --> 1:23:17.680
 It's going to be proper nutrition.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:19.220
 And we'll talk more about nutrition in a moment.

1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:23.000
 It's going to be limiting excessive prolonged stressors

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.200
 or stress.

1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:26.260
 And indeed we've done episodes about

1:23:26.260 --> 1:23:29.000
 just about all of those things, but certainly about stress.

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.980
 We have an episode of the Huberman Lab podcast

1:23:30.980 --> 1:23:32.540
 that you can find at HubermanLab.com

1:23:32.540 --> 1:23:33.820
 all about mastering stress,

1:23:33.820 --> 1:23:37.180
 how to avoid long periods of intense stress,

1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:38.660
 what to do to offset those.

1:23:40.140 --> 1:23:43.420
 Given that stress can disrupt the microbiome,

1:23:43.420 --> 1:23:45.940
 whether or not you're fasting or not,

1:23:45.940 --> 1:23:48.460
 those tools ought to be useful.

1:23:48.460 --> 1:23:51.340
 Now, in what I consider to be a landmark study

1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:54.180
 exploring the relationship between the gut microbiome,

1:23:54.180 --> 1:23:57.220
 food intake, and overall health

1:23:57.220 --> 1:24:00.040
 is this paper from Justin Sonnenberg's lab

1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:03.620
 and Chris Gardner's lab, both of which are at Stanford.

1:24:03.620 --> 1:24:04.800
 And the paper entitled,

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:08.080
 Gut Microbiota Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status

1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:09.540
 was published in the journal Cell,

1:24:09.540 --> 1:24:11.760
 which is among the three top journals,

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:13.840
 perhaps in the world, Nature, Science, and Cell

1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:17.500
 really being the apex journals for overall science,

1:24:18.660 --> 1:24:21.120
 and especially for biomedical sciences.

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:23.420
 Now, this is a very interesting study.

1:24:23.420 --> 1:24:24.700
 It was done on humans.

1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:25.960
 There were two major groups.

1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:28.140
 One group of humans was instructed

1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:30.820
 to increase the amount of fiber in their diet

1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:33.380
 and in fact ate a high fiber diet.

1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:35.120
 The other group was instructed

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:38.660
 to eat a high fermented food diet.

1:24:38.660 --> 1:24:42.540
 Now, both groups started off not having eaten

1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:45.100
 a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods,

1:24:45.100 --> 1:24:47.780
 and were told to increase the amount of either fiber

1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:49.700
 or fermented foods that they were ingesting

1:24:49.700 --> 1:24:51.620
 over a four-week ramp up period.

1:24:51.620 --> 1:24:54.600
 And that was to avoid any major gastric distress.

1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:56.700
 It turns out that if you're not already accustomed

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:59.420
 to eating a lot of fiber, increasing your amount of fiber

1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:02.020
 dramatically can cause some gastric distress.

1:25:02.020 --> 1:25:04.620
 But if you ease into it over time, as we'll see,

1:25:04.620 --> 1:25:05.860
 there's a mechanism behind this,

1:25:05.860 --> 1:25:08.020
 which was unveiled in this study.

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:09.620
 But if you ease into it over time,

1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:11.540
 then the system can tolerate it.

1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:16.140
 Likewise, high fermented foods can be readily tolerated

1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:18.640
 if there's a ramp up phase of ingesting

1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:20.780
 maybe one serving a day, then maybe two servings,

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:23.180
 and ramping up, in this case,

1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:25.180
 as high as six servings per day.

1:25:25.180 --> 1:25:29.940
 However, after this ramp up period,

1:25:29.940 --> 1:25:32.060
 the group assigned to the high fiber condition

1:25:32.060 --> 1:25:34.900
 maintained high fiber intake for six weeks,

1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:36.620
 and the high fermented food group

1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:40.380
 maintained high fermented food intake for six weeks,

1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:44.220
 after which they went off either the high fiber

1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:45.580
 or the high fermented food diet,

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:47.660
 and there was a four-week follow-up period

1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:50.420
 during which they gradually returned to baseline.

1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:52.700
 Throughout the study, their gut microbiome

1:25:52.700 --> 1:25:56.200
 was evaluated for the diversity of gut microbiota,

1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:58.140
 and there were also a number of measures

1:25:58.140 --> 1:25:59.820
 of immune system function,

1:25:59.820 --> 1:26:03.180
 in particular measures of the so-called inflammatome.

1:26:03.180 --> 1:26:05.520
 The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved.

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:07.180
 I did a whole episode about the immune system.

1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:08.220
 If you're interested in learning

1:26:08.220 --> 1:26:09.820
 what some of those molecules are,

1:26:09.820 --> 1:26:11.940
 various cytokines and signaling molecules

1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:14.780
 that reflect either high inflammation states

1:26:14.780 --> 1:26:17.380
 or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body,

1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:19.100
 you're welcome to check out that episode.

1:26:19.100 --> 1:26:21.620
 It's also at hubermanlab.com.

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:24.020
 Regardless, in this study,

1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:27.400
 they explored the sorts of immune markers

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:29.580
 that were expressed in either of the two groups

1:26:29.580 --> 1:26:30.860
 and compared those.

1:26:30.860 --> 1:26:32.780
 The basic takeaway of this paper

1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:36.260
 was that contrary to what they predicted,

1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:39.100
 the high fiber diet did not lead

1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:41.420
 to increased microbiota diversity,

1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:43.020
 at least not in all cases,

1:26:43.020 --> 1:26:45.540
 and that was somewhat surprising.

1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:48.140
 You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber

1:26:48.140 --> 1:26:50.740
 and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables

1:26:50.740 --> 1:26:51.940
 and grains and so forth

1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:56.380
 are supposed to support microbiota diversity

1:26:56.380 --> 1:26:59.340
 and the proliferation of existing microbiota,

1:26:59.340 --> 1:27:01.640
 and that is not what they observed.

1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:03.580
 Although I want to be very clear in pointing out

1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:06.040
 that the results do not indicate

1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:10.060
 that fiber is not useful for health overall,

1:27:10.060 --> 1:27:11.280
 but it does point to the fact

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:13.020
 that increasing fiber intake

1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:15.120
 did not increase microbiota diversity,

1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:17.560
 which in general, as I mentioned before,

1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:21.940
 is associated with improvements in microbiota function,

1:27:21.940 --> 1:27:24.880
 health, and overall wellbeing.

1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.940
 Now, the high fermented food diet condition

1:27:26.940 --> 1:27:28.460
 was very interesting.

1:27:28.460 --> 1:27:31.540
 It resulted in increased microbiome diversity

1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:35.020
 and decreased inflammatory signals and activity.

1:27:35.020 --> 1:27:36.540
 So there was a twofer,

1:27:36.540 --> 1:27:39.220
 basically by ingesting high fermented foods

1:27:40.380 --> 1:27:41.580
 in fair abundance, right?

1:27:41.580 --> 1:27:43.620
 You know, four to six servings or more per day

1:27:43.620 --> 1:27:46.100
 is a lot of fermented food intake.

1:27:46.100 --> 1:27:48.120
 We'll talk about what some of those foods were,

1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.340
 but the outcome was very positive.

1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:53.540
 There was a clear increase in microbiome diversity

1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:56.040
 and decreased inflammatory signals.

1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:58.300
 So things like interleukin-6,

1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:00.700
 a number of other interleukins and cytokines

1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:03.500
 that are associated with increased inflammation

1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:06.420
 in the brain and body were reduced significantly.

1:28:06.420 --> 1:28:08.880
 Now, let's talk a little bit about this notion

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:11.060
 of number of servings, et cetera.

1:28:11.060 --> 1:28:13.960
 One somewhat minor point of the study,

1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:16.100
 but I think is useful in terms of taking

1:28:16.100 --> 1:28:18.000
 an actionable stance with this,

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.220
 is that the number of servings of fermented foods

1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:25.420
 was not as strong a predictor of improvements

1:28:25.420 --> 1:28:28.300
 in the inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation,

1:28:28.300 --> 1:28:30.960
 and improvements in microbiota diversity,

1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:34.760
 as was the duration of time that the individuals

1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:36.580
 were ingesting fermented foods.

1:28:36.580 --> 1:28:38.780
 In other words, the longer that one is consistently

1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:41.220
 ingesting fermented foods on a daily basis,

1:28:41.220 --> 1:28:44.160
 the better the outcomes in terms of the gut microbiome

1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:46.320
 and for reducing inflammation.

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:48.340
 So I think that's an important point.

1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:50.780
 And I make that point especially because

1:28:50.780 --> 1:28:53.340
 for a lot of people, even if you do this ramp up phase,

1:28:53.340 --> 1:28:55.660
 six servings per day of fermented foods

1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:57.340
 can seem like quite a lot.

1:28:57.340 --> 1:28:59.900
 So what are these fermented foods, right?

1:28:59.900 --> 1:29:03.440
 I think many of us are familiar with certain cheeses

1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:05.780
 and being fermented and beer being fermented

1:29:05.780 --> 1:29:07.580
 and kombucha is fermented.

1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:09.280
 In this study, they focus specifically

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:11.540
 on low sugar fermented foods.

1:29:11.540 --> 1:29:13.240
 So this would be plain yogurt,

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:17.860
 in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.

1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:19.540
 An important consideration, however,

1:29:19.540 --> 1:29:21.360
 is that it needs to contain

1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:23.140
 what are called live active cultures,

1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:26.460
 which means there actually have to be microbiota

1:29:26.460 --> 1:29:28.460
 that are alive inside the sauerkraut.

1:29:28.460 --> 1:29:30.240
 One way you know whether or not that's happening

1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:34.440
 is if you purchase sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi

1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:38.340
 from a jar or a container that's on the non-refrigerated

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.560
 shelf or the non-refrigerated section of your grocery store,

1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:44.980
 it is not going to contain live active cultures

1:29:44.980 --> 1:29:46.460
 of microbiota.

1:29:46.460 --> 1:29:50.420
 And likewise, if you consume yogurt that has a lot of sugar

1:29:50.420 --> 1:29:53.080
 or other components added to it,

1:29:53.080 --> 1:29:55.380
 it's not going to have the same positive effect

1:29:55.380 --> 1:29:57.940
 on the microbiome, at least that's the prediction

1:29:57.940 --> 1:29:59.940
 given some of the relationship between

1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:01.940
 the sorts of microbiota that live in sugar

1:30:01.940 --> 1:30:04.180
 versus plain type yogurts.

1:30:04.180 --> 1:30:05.980
 They gave people the option of consuming

1:30:05.980 --> 1:30:08.780
 any number of different low sugar fermented foods.

1:30:08.780 --> 1:30:10.920
 So again, that could be sauerkraut, kimchi,

1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:13.060
 things like kefir, natto.

1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:17.780
 In Japan, they consume natto, which is a fermented food.

1:30:17.780 --> 1:30:20.400
 Beer was not one of the fermented foods

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:22.860
 that was included in the fermented food list.

1:30:22.860 --> 1:30:25.100
 And when we say six servings per day,

1:30:25.100 --> 1:30:29.060
 that is indeed six ounce servings

1:30:29.060 --> 1:30:31.580
 or four to six ounce servings.

1:30:31.580 --> 1:30:34.820
 It was not six servings of what's listed on the package.

1:30:34.820 --> 1:30:36.740
 So again, that turns out to be

1:30:36.740 --> 1:30:38.300
 a fair amount of fermented foods.

1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:39.340
 How should you gauge whether or not

1:30:39.340 --> 1:30:40.180
 you're getting enough of this?

1:30:40.180 --> 1:30:43.380
 Well, if you decide to take on this protocol

1:30:43.380 --> 1:30:44.860
 of ingesting more fermented foods,

1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:47.140
 which at least by my read of this study

1:30:47.140 --> 1:30:49.180
 and some of the follow-up work that's being done,

1:30:49.180 --> 1:30:50.900
 sounds like a terrific idea.

1:30:50.900 --> 1:30:52.780
 If you want to improve your gut microbiome

1:30:52.780 --> 1:30:55.540
 for all the great reasons that one would want to,

1:30:55.540 --> 1:30:59.500
 brain, body, health, reduced inflammation and on and on.

1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:03.000
 Well, then you definitely want to focus on fermented foods

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.420
 that you enjoy consuming.

1:31:04.420 --> 1:31:07.780
 So for you, if that's kefir or for you that's plain yogurt

1:31:07.780 --> 1:31:09.180
 or for you that's sauerkraut,

1:31:09.180 --> 1:31:12.040
 which happens to be my personal favorite,

1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:14.660
 then you want to make sure that it's going to be something

1:31:14.660 --> 1:31:17.780
 that you are going to enjoy ingesting quite a lot of

1:31:17.780 --> 1:31:20.380
 and that you're going to be okay with ingesting

1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:21.860
 probably throughout the day.

1:31:21.860 --> 1:31:23.960
 Now, people follow different meal schedules, of course,

1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:26.100
 but this does require not just eating

1:31:26.100 --> 1:31:29.980
 all the fermented foods just before bedtime or one meal.

1:31:29.980 --> 1:31:31.540
 I suppose you could do that,

1:31:31.540 --> 1:31:33.340
 but in general, it's going to work best

1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:35.320
 in terms of limiting gastric distress

1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:37.500
 by spreading it out throughout the day.

1:31:37.500 --> 1:31:39.020
 I also want to mention brine.

1:31:39.020 --> 1:31:43.600
 Brine is the liquid that surrounds sauerkraut.

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:46.980
 It's that very salty fluid,

1:31:46.980 --> 1:31:49.700
 and that contains a lot of active live cultures.

1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:52.140
 And they did include,

1:31:52.140 --> 1:31:55.740
 or they allowed people to include brine in this study.

1:31:55.740 --> 1:31:57.860
 And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenberg,

1:31:57.860 --> 1:32:00.980
 which we'll go into in more detail on the episode

1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:02.180
 that comes out next week,

1:32:02.180 --> 1:32:04.140
 we talk a lot about the particular value

1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:05.360
 that brine might hold

1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:08.540
 in terms of bringing about microbiota diversity

1:32:08.540 --> 1:32:12.020
 because of the richness of live cultures that it contains.

1:32:12.020 --> 1:32:14.500
 I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition

1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:16.180
 because there were some interesting observations

1:32:16.180 --> 1:32:18.780
 about the people that were placed into that condition.

1:32:18.780 --> 1:32:23.140
 First of all, increasing the amount of fiber

1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:26.960
 definitely increased the number of enzymes

1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:29.820
 that can be used to digest fiber.

1:32:29.820 --> 1:32:32.860
 This is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up phase

1:32:32.860 --> 1:32:35.100
 where accumulation of more fiber intake

1:32:35.100 --> 1:32:37.660
 can over time lead to less gastric distress,

1:32:37.660 --> 1:32:39.560
 but also to more utilization of fiber,

1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:41.300
 which overall should be a good thing.

1:32:41.300 --> 1:32:43.780
 So while they didn't observe an increase

1:32:43.780 --> 1:32:45.520
 in immune system function

1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:47.680
 or an increase in microbiota diversity,

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:51.580
 there was an increase in these fiber digesting enzymes.

1:32:51.580 --> 1:32:52.420
 They also observed

1:32:52.420 --> 1:32:55.180
 what they called personalized immune responses.

1:32:55.180 --> 1:32:57.980
 There were some subgroups within the high fiber group

1:32:57.980 --> 1:33:02.700
 that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to,

1:33:02.700 --> 1:33:05.060
 or I should say their inflammatome,

1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:06.860
 meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed

1:33:06.860 --> 1:33:09.660
 as well as their microbiota diversity.

1:33:09.660 --> 1:33:11.060
 So there were essentially three groups.

1:33:11.060 --> 1:33:14.580
 One group actually showed an increase in inflammatory markers

1:33:14.580 --> 1:33:15.820
 so that was quite surprising

1:33:15.820 --> 1:33:19.580
 and probably not wonderful for the message

1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:21.140
 that fiber is always good for us,

1:33:21.140 --> 1:33:25.820
 but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group.

1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:28.660
 Another group and still another group

1:33:28.660 --> 1:33:31.860
 both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity,

1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:34.300
 although to varying degrees.

1:33:34.300 --> 1:33:36.660
 So I don't want to paint the picture that fiber is bad,

1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:39.060
 but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects

1:33:39.060 --> 1:33:40.780
 on microbiota diversity

1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:43.180
 that the high fermented food diet did.

1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:44.340
 So my read of this study,

1:33:44.340 --> 1:33:46.980
 and I think the stance that many others have taken

1:33:46.980 --> 1:33:48.620
 as a consequence of these data,

1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:52.540
 is that we should be increasing our fermented food intake,

1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:54.640
 that that's simply a good thing to do

1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:56.500
 in order to support our gut microbiome

1:33:56.500 --> 1:34:00.540
 and to reduce inflammatory signals in our brain and body.

1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:02.500
 And there are a number of different ways to do that.

1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:04.220
 I mentioned some of the particular foods.

1:34:04.220 --> 1:34:05.580
 However, anytime you're talking about

1:34:05.580 --> 1:34:07.420
 ingesting fermented foods,

1:34:07.420 --> 1:34:09.340
 especially the high quality ones

1:34:09.340 --> 1:34:12.220
 that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store

1:34:12.220 --> 1:34:16.440
 or that end that have low sugar content, et cetera,

1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:18.340
 we do have to be considerate of cost

1:34:18.340 --> 1:34:20.400
 because certain things like kombuchas, for instance,

1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:22.500
 can be quite costly.

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:23.820
 I should also mention some kombuchas

1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:24.980
 that actually contain alcohol.

1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:28.740
 Some do not or contain very little amounts of alcohol.

1:34:30.100 --> 1:34:32.840
 One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods

1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:34.580
 while still being able to accumulate

1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:35.940
 a lot of fermented food intake

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:38.300
 is to simply make those fermented foods yourself.

1:34:38.300 --> 1:34:40.540
 This is something that we've started exploring

1:34:40.540 --> 1:34:42.860
 and experimenting with in our home.

1:34:42.860 --> 1:34:43.980
 One simple way to do this

1:34:43.980 --> 1:34:45.620
 is to just make your own sauerkraut.

1:34:45.620 --> 1:34:47.020
 It involves very few ingredients.

1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:50.020
 It basically involves cabbage, water, and salt,

1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:52.140
 but there's a specific process that you need to follow

1:34:52.140 --> 1:34:56.180
 in order to create these large volumes of sauerkraut at home

1:34:56.180 --> 1:34:58.340
 using that low cost method.

1:34:58.340 --> 1:35:00.580
 The best resource that I know of

1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:04.560
 in order to follow a great recipe to make homemade sauerkraut

1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:07.100
 would be the recipe for homemade sauerkraut

1:35:07.100 --> 1:35:08.760
 that's contained in Tim Ferriss' book,

1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:09.820
 "'The 4-Hour Chef.'"

1:35:09.820 --> 1:35:11.520
 There's an excellent protocol there.

1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:13.100
 It involves chopping up the cabbage,

1:35:13.100 --> 1:35:16.500
 putting into a bowl, mashing it up with your hands,

1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:17.980
 which can be fun,

1:35:17.980 --> 1:35:19.940
 putting water in there, some salt, covering it,

1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:21.960
 and then keeping it in a particular environment,

1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:23.820
 and then routinely scraping off

1:35:23.820 --> 1:35:25.500
 some of the material from the surface.

1:35:25.500 --> 1:35:27.780
 You have to do that in order to make sure

1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:32.200
 that you're not getting microbes and things growing in it

1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:33.120
 that are bad for you,

1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:34.780
 so you definitely want to pay careful attention

1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:35.700
 to the protocol,

1:35:35.700 --> 1:35:37.580
 but that's a very, very low cost way

1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:40.020
 of generating lots and lots of fermented foods

1:35:40.020 --> 1:35:43.100
 so you don't go broke trying to improve your microbiome.

1:35:43.100 --> 1:35:44.060
 The other thing that you can do

1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:46.500
 if you're really obsessed with kombucha

1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:48.820
 or something like that to avoid the high cost of kombucha

1:35:48.820 --> 1:35:51.060
 is there are ways that you can get the SCOBY,

1:35:51.060 --> 1:35:52.260
 which basically allows you to make

1:35:52.260 --> 1:35:53.340
 your own kombucha at home.

1:35:53.340 --> 1:35:54.220
 I've never tried this,

1:35:54.220 --> 1:35:55.800
 but when I was a postdoc,

1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:57.200
 there was an undergraduate in the lab.

1:35:57.200 --> 1:35:59.740
 I think, well, I won't out him,

1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:01.780
 but he's now gone on to medical school,

1:36:01.780 --> 1:36:04.620
 and I think he's passed his residency

1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:06.340
 and is a practicing doctor,

1:36:06.340 --> 1:36:08.740
 but nonetheless, he was always making kombucha at home.

1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:10.340
 He told me it was exceedingly easy,

1:36:10.340 --> 1:36:11.940
 but then again, he had a number of other skills

1:36:11.940 --> 1:36:14.100
 and attributes that made me think

1:36:14.100 --> 1:36:15.860
 that he could do pretty much anything with ease,

1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:18.420
 whereas I tend to struggle with even basic cooking.

1:36:18.420 --> 1:36:20.740
 So maybe if you're feeling a little more adventurous,

1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:23.320
 you could explore making your own kombucha,

1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:24.740
 but there are a number of different protocols

1:36:24.740 --> 1:36:25.680
 and recipes out there

1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:28.380
 for making your own low sugar fermented foods.

1:36:28.380 --> 1:36:30.100
 So you needn't run out

1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:32.260
 and buy fresh sauerkraut all the time.

1:36:32.260 --> 1:36:33.500
 I should also mention for those of you

1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:37.500
 that are interested in getting your fermented intake

1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:40.820
 from pickles, jarred pickles rarely,

1:36:40.820 --> 1:36:42.660
 if ever contain ferment.

1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:45.180
 Mostly they're just soaked in vinegar water

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.060
 and with some spices,

1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:48.140
 but there are some that contain ferment.

1:36:48.140 --> 1:36:50.700
 You actually have to look for that on the container

1:36:50.700 --> 1:36:51.900
 and I don't know, maybe someone out there

1:36:51.900 --> 1:36:54.660
 knows how to make natto and knows how to make kimchi well

1:36:54.660 --> 1:36:56.180
 and things of that sort.

1:36:56.180 --> 1:36:59.120
 It certainly is the case based on the data from the study

1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:02.180
 that ingesting more servings of fermented food per day

1:37:02.180 --> 1:37:04.260
 ought to be beneficial for our gut microbiome.

1:37:04.260 --> 1:37:05.420
 And since this is an episode,

1:37:05.420 --> 1:37:08.480
 not just about gut microbiome, but gut brain health,

1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:11.000
 I should mention that one form of signaling

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:12.700
 between the gut microbiome and the brain,

1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:14.020
 which we did not discuss,

1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:15.980
 and I'll just touch on briefly,

1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:19.300
 is that when the inflammatome

1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:22.200
 or the genes and markers of inflammation

1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.220
 are kept in a healthy range,

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:27.100
 there's an active signaling

1:37:27.100 --> 1:37:29.400
 of that immune system status to the brain.

1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:31.520
 There's an intermediate cell type

1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:34.300
 that communicates immune status to the brain.

1:37:34.300 --> 1:37:36.220
 And that cell type is the microglial cell.

1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:38.700
 It's a type of glia as the name suggests.

1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:41.500
 When there's a lot of inflammation in the body,

1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:43.780
 these microglia actually get activated

1:37:43.780 --> 1:37:47.180
 and can start eating away at various components

1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:48.420
 of the brain and nervous system.

1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:49.760
 And I don't mean massive eating away.

1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:51.240
 They're not going to digest the whole brain,

1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:55.220
 but these microglia are sort of the resident macrophages

1:37:55.220 --> 1:37:56.060
 of the brain.

1:37:56.060 --> 1:37:57.420
 Macrophages are in the periphery

1:37:57.420 --> 1:37:59.820
 and they gobble up debris and things of that sort.

1:37:59.820 --> 1:38:03.380
 The microglia on a regular basis are eating up debris

1:38:03.380 --> 1:38:05.840
 that accumulates across waking cycles

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:08.140
 and in response to micro damage of the brain

1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:09.440
 that occurs on a daily basis.

1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:11.820
 So they have a lot of important basic everyday

1:38:11.820 --> 1:38:13.720
 what we call housekeeping functions.

1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:15.920
 But when there's a lot of inflammation in the body,

1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:18.700
 when there's a massive immune response,

1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:20.820
 the microglia can be hyperactivated

1:38:20.820 --> 1:38:21.820
 and that's thought to lead

1:38:21.820 --> 1:38:24.460
 to any number of different cognitive defects

1:38:24.460 --> 1:38:25.700
 or challenges, thinking,

1:38:25.700 --> 1:38:29.180
 or maybe even some forms of neurodegeneration over time.

1:38:29.180 --> 1:38:31.440
 Although that last point is more of a hypothesis

1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:34.060
 than a well tamped down fact at this point.

1:38:34.060 --> 1:38:36.700
 There's still a lot of investigation to be done in humans.

1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:39.560
 The animal data, however, are very, very strong

1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.500
 that when the immune system is activated

1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.140
 or chronically activated or hyperactivated,

1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:45.820
 that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue,

1:38:45.820 --> 1:38:47.980
 and other central nervous system tissue can suffer.

1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:49.700
 So there are a lot of reasons

1:38:49.700 --> 1:38:53.200
 to want to not just improve microbiome diversity,

1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:56.140
 but to also improve immune system function

1:38:56.140 --> 1:38:58.800
 and to limit the number of inflammatory markers

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:00.140
 that are present in the body

1:39:00.140 --> 1:39:02.340
 because of the way those inflammatory markers

1:39:02.340 --> 1:39:05.340
 can signal deleterious events in the brain.

1:39:05.340 --> 1:39:07.860
 And while eating fermented foods

1:39:07.860 --> 1:39:09.820
 and making your own fermented foods

1:39:09.820 --> 1:39:11.900
 and buying high quality fermented foods

1:39:11.900 --> 1:39:13.780
 might seem like an inconvenience,

1:39:13.780 --> 1:39:17.500
 I would say that from the perspective of cost benefit

1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:21.020
 or effort benefit, it's actually quite a good situation

1:39:21.020 --> 1:39:24.180
 where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods

1:39:24.180 --> 1:39:26.380
 or servings of fermented foods that you're eating per day

1:39:26.380 --> 1:39:27.700
 over a period of a few weeks

1:39:27.700 --> 1:39:30.220
 so that you're tolerating that well,

1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:32.240
 that ought to have a very positive effect

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:34.180
 on your microbiome diversity

1:39:34.180 --> 1:39:36.720
 and indeed on gut brain function.

1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:38.100
 And I'll be the last to suggest

1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.500
 that people completely forgo on fiber.

1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:41.860
 I think there's some debate out there

1:39:41.860 --> 1:39:43.420
 as to how much fiber we need

1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:46.100
 and whether or not certain forms of fiber

1:39:46.100 --> 1:39:47.260
 are better than others.

1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:48.620
 I'm not going to get into that debate.

1:39:48.620 --> 1:39:49.780
 It's barbed wire enough

1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:52.740
 without me injecting my own views into that debate.

1:39:52.740 --> 1:39:55.060
 But I think there's ample evidence to support the fact

1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:57.020
 that for most people,

1:39:57.020 --> 1:40:00.360
 ingesting a fair amount of fiber is going to be a good idea.

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:01.340
 I would just say that make sure

1:40:01.340 --> 1:40:04.160
 that you're also ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods.

1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:06.100
 And along the lines of fiber,

1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:08.660
 in an accompanying article published in Cell,

1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:11.660
 which was sort of what we call a news and views piece

1:40:11.660 --> 1:40:15.320
 about the Sonnenberg and Gardner paper,

1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:16.880
 they make a quite good point,

1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:19.620
 which is that the increase in fiber intake

1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:23.100
 that led to this increase in carbohydrate active enzymes,

1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:25.520
 these CAZ-zymes as they're called,

1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:28.260
 these are enzymes that help digest fiber,

1:40:28.260 --> 1:40:31.820
 quote, indicating an enhanced capacity for the microbiome

1:40:31.820 --> 1:40:35.380
 to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods.

1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:37.580
 So in other words,

1:40:37.580 --> 1:40:40.880
 eating more fiber and fibrous foods

1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:42.520
 allowed for an increase in these enzymes

1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:44.840
 that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods

1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:47.020
 or to better digest fibrous foods

1:40:47.020 --> 1:40:48.760
 that are coming in through other sources.

1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:52.580
 So there is at least one utility for increasing fiber,

1:40:52.580 --> 1:40:55.540
 even though it's separate from the gut microbiota diversity

1:40:55.540 --> 1:40:57.380
 and reducing inflammation.

1:40:57.380 --> 1:40:59.820
 And I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on some of the data

1:40:59.820 --> 1:41:02.460
 and controversy about artificial sweeteners

1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:04.440
 and the gut microbiome.

1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:06.780
 I want to be very clear that what I'm about to tell you

1:41:06.780 --> 1:41:09.260
 has only been established in animal models,

1:41:09.260 --> 1:41:11.780
 in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge.

1:41:11.780 --> 1:41:14.560
 What the studies have shown, and there were several,

1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:16.720
 but one published in the journal Nature a few years back

1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:18.700
 is the one that got the most amount of attention,

1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:20.740
 is that animals that consume large amounts

1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:22.200
 of artificial sweeteners,

1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:25.020
 in particular things like saccharin or sucralose,

1:41:25.020 --> 1:41:27.620
 show disruptions in their gut microbiome.

1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:29.360
 I'm not aware of any studies in humans

1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:30.700
 that show the equivalent effect,

1:41:30.700 --> 1:41:32.840
 and I'm not aware of any studies in humans

1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:34.700
 that show the equivalent effect

1:41:34.700 --> 1:41:37.820
 for things like plant-based low calorie sweeteners,

1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:41.040
 things like stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort.

1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:43.380
 And at least by my exploration,

1:41:43.380 --> 1:41:45.440
 I couldn't find any data specifically related

1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:47.740
 to the sweetener aspartame.

1:41:47.740 --> 1:41:50.340
 So right now it's somewhat controversial,

1:41:50.340 --> 1:41:52.840
 and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there

1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.780
 when one group will come out saying

1:41:54.780 --> 1:41:56.060
 that artificial sweeteners are bad

1:41:56.060 --> 1:41:58.060
 because they disrupt the gut microbiome.

1:41:58.060 --> 1:42:01.360
 The response generally from a number of people as well,

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:02.860
 that's only been shown in animal models,

1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:04.260
 and indeed that's true.

1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:06.820
 So right now I don't think that there's a strong case

1:42:06.820 --> 1:42:08.100
 one way or the other.

1:42:08.100 --> 1:42:10.220
 I think that people should basically ask themselves

1:42:10.220 --> 1:42:13.080
 whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not,

1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:15.540
 whether or not they're willing to risk it or not,

1:42:15.540 --> 1:42:18.100
 and obviously that's an individual choice.

1:42:18.100 --> 1:42:20.660
 I also want to point out a recent study

1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:22.980
 from Diego Bajorquez's lab,

1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:25.340
 which actually shows, however,

1:42:25.340 --> 1:42:28.620
 that neurons in the gut, those neuropod cells,

1:42:28.620 --> 1:42:30.700
 are actually capable of distinguishing

1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:33.780
 between real sugars and artificial sweeteners.

1:42:33.780 --> 1:42:36.220
 This is a really interesting body of work.

1:42:36.220 --> 1:42:40.580
 It was published just recently, I should say, February, 2022.

1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:41.720
 The title of the paper is

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:43.520
 "'The Preference for Sugar Over Sweetener'

1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:45.620
 Depends on a Gut Sensor Cell."

1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:47.160
 And to make a long story short,

1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:50.320
 what they showed was there's a category of neuropod cells

1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:52.980
 that recognize sugar in the gut

1:42:52.980 --> 1:42:55.040
 and signal that information

1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:57.300
 about the presence of sugar in the gut

1:42:57.300 --> 1:42:59.820
 to the brain via the pathways we talked about before,

1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:03.580
 the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.

1:43:03.580 --> 1:43:06.780
 Interestingly, the very same category of neurons

1:43:06.780 --> 1:43:10.260
 can respond to artificial sweeteners

1:43:10.260 --> 1:43:12.100
 and signal that information to the brain,

1:43:12.100 --> 1:43:14.720
 but the pattern of signaling,

1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:17.620
 and indeed the signature pattern

1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:20.660
 that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain

1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:22.740
 is actually quite a bit different

1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:25.780
 when these same neurons are responding

1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:29.700
 to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar.

1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:32.020
 This is very interesting because what it means is,

1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:36.140
 first of all, that neurons have incredible specificity

1:43:36.140 --> 1:43:37.660
 in terms of what they are signaling

1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:39.440
 from the gut to the brain.

1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:42.860
 And it also means that there may be a particular signal

1:43:42.860 --> 1:43:44.480
 that the brain receives that says,

1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:49.480
 I'm receiving some intake of food or drink that tastes sweet

1:43:49.900 --> 1:43:52.800
 but doesn't actually offer much nutrients

1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:53.960
 in the direction of sweetness,

1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:56.700
 meaning that it doesn't have calories despite being sweet.

1:43:56.700 --> 1:43:59.040
 Now, again, this is all subconscious processing.

1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:00.860
 And like with the previous studies,

1:44:00.860 --> 1:44:03.420
 we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners

1:44:03.420 --> 1:44:05.580
 generally and the gut microbiome generally,

1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:08.940
 it's unclear how this relates to humans

1:44:08.940 --> 1:44:10.180
 at this point in time.

1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:12.660
 But given the similarity of cellular processes

1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:15.860
 and molecular processes at the level of gut brain in mice,

1:44:15.860 --> 1:44:18.380
 I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells

1:44:18.380 --> 1:44:21.860
 very likely are capable of signaling presence

1:44:21.860 --> 1:44:23.700
 of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener

1:44:23.700 --> 1:44:24.900
 in humans as well,

1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:27.620
 although that still remains to be determined empirically.

1:44:27.620 --> 1:44:30.620
 So I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered today.

1:44:30.620 --> 1:44:33.340
 I started off by talking about the structure and function

1:44:33.340 --> 1:44:35.060
 of the gut brain axis.

1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:37.540
 I described the basic structure and function

1:44:37.540 --> 1:44:39.500
 of the digestive pathway

1:44:39.500 --> 1:44:42.820
 and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiota species,

1:44:42.820 --> 1:44:45.240
 meaning many, many little bacteria

1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:47.700
 that can signal all sorts of things

1:44:47.700 --> 1:44:49.860
 to the rest of the brain and body.

1:44:49.860 --> 1:44:51.460
 And indeed, we talked about the various ways

1:44:51.460 --> 1:44:52.460
 that they do that.

1:44:52.460 --> 1:44:54.460
 We talked about direct pathways,

1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:57.380
 literally nerve networks that extend from the gut

1:44:57.380 --> 1:45:00.400
 up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut.

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:02.880
 And we talked about indirect pathways,

1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:04.820
 how some of the gut microbiota

1:45:04.820 --> 1:45:06.980
 can actually synthesize neurotransmitters

1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:09.620
 that get out into the bloodstream, can impact the body,

1:45:09.620 --> 1:45:11.440
 can impact the immune system,

1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:13.120
 and can get into the brain

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.300
 and act as neurotransmitters in the brain,

1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:17.420
 just as would neurotransmitters

1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:19.500
 that originate from within the brain.

1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:22.700
 We also talked about what constitutes

1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:25.380
 a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.

1:45:25.380 --> 1:45:28.380
 And it's very clear that having a diverse microbiome

1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:32.800
 is healthier than having a non-diverse microbiome.

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:35.700
 But as I pointed out, there's still a lot of questions

1:45:35.700 --> 1:45:38.860
 as to exactly what microbiota species you want to enhance

1:45:38.860 --> 1:45:41.300
 and which ones you want to suppress in the gut

1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:44.460
 in order to achieve the best gut brain access function.

1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:47.080
 We talked about how things like fasting

1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:48.740
 might impact the microbiome

1:45:48.740 --> 1:45:51.180
 and how some of that might be a little bit counterintuitive

1:45:51.180 --> 1:45:54.060
 based on some of the other positive effects of fasting,

1:45:54.060 --> 1:45:56.180
 or if we're not just discussing fasting,

1:45:56.180 --> 1:45:58.840
 some other types of somewhat restrictive diets,

1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:00.100
 either restrictive in time

1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:02.900
 or restrictive in terms of macronutrient intake,

1:46:02.900 --> 1:46:05.140
 how those may or may not improve

1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:06.620
 the health of the gut microbiome.

1:46:06.620 --> 1:46:08.380
 And the basic takeaway was that

1:46:08.380 --> 1:46:11.420
 because we don't know exactly how specific diets

1:46:11.420 --> 1:46:13.020
 impact the gut microbiome,

1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:15.060
 and we don't know how fasting

1:46:15.060 --> 1:46:17.820
 either promotes or degrades the microbiome,

1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:20.460
 we really can't say whether or not they are improving

1:46:20.460 --> 1:46:22.920
 or degrading the microbiome at this time.

1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:25.880
 However, it is clear that stress,

1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:27.100
 in particular chronic stress,

1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:28.780
 can disrupt the gut microbiome.

1:46:28.780 --> 1:46:29.780
 It's also clear, of course,

1:46:29.780 --> 1:46:32.420
 that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome.

1:46:32.420 --> 1:46:33.740
 And that brings us to the topic

1:46:33.740 --> 1:46:35.780
 of prebiotics and probiotics.

1:46:35.780 --> 1:46:38.400
 And I emphasize the fact that for most people,

1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:41.980
 ingesting high quality non-processed foods

1:46:41.980 --> 1:46:44.680
 that includes some prebiotic fiber,

1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:47.380
 but also that includes some probiotics

1:46:47.380 --> 1:46:48.580
 will probably be healthy,

1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:50.860
 but not excessive levels of probiotics.

1:46:50.860 --> 1:46:52.820
 High levels of supplemented probiotics

1:46:52.820 --> 1:46:54.540
 of the sort that would come in a probiotic pill

1:46:54.540 --> 1:46:56.500
 or even prescription probiotics

1:46:56.500 --> 1:46:58.420
 would probably lend themselves best

1:46:58.420 --> 1:47:01.020
 to when people were under severe chronic stress

1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:03.260
 or had just come off a serious round

1:47:03.260 --> 1:47:06.740
 or an ongoing or repeated rounds of antibiotics.

1:47:06.740 --> 1:47:09.380
 That does not mean that ingesting probiotics

1:47:09.380 --> 1:47:11.520
 in any form or any kind is not good.

1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:14.940
 It just means that the very high dose probiotics,

1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:16.940
 again, typically found in prescription form

1:47:16.940 --> 1:47:18.900
 or capsule pill form,

1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:21.020
 probably are best reserved to cases where,

1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:22.820
 of course, your doctor prescribes them.

1:47:22.820 --> 1:47:24.720
 You should always follow your doctor's advice.

1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:27.300
 But in cases where perhaps you are jet lagged,

1:47:27.300 --> 1:47:29.780
 you're traveling excessively for any reason

1:47:29.780 --> 1:47:32.220
 or working excessively, you're not getting enough sleep,

1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:35.220
 or your diet is radically changed from normal.

1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:38.220
 And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber

1:47:38.220 --> 1:47:39.900
 in your diet might be useful

1:47:39.900 --> 1:47:43.100
 for increasing fiber digesting enzymes

1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:45.240
 and the assimilation of fibrous foods,

1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:47.980
 but that it's really the ingestion of fermented foods.

1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:50.020
 And in fact, getting anywhere from four

1:47:50.020 --> 1:47:52.400
 or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods

1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:53.980
 can be immensely beneficial

1:47:53.980 --> 1:47:56.660
 for reducing inflammatory markers in the body

1:47:56.660 --> 1:48:01.160
 and for improving microbiota diversity all along the gut

1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.700
 and thereby improving signaling

1:48:03.700 --> 1:48:07.620
 and outcomes along the gut brain axis.

1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:11.020
 So we went all the way from structure to function

1:48:11.020 --> 1:48:13.660
 to the four kinds of signaling, mechanical, chemical,

1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:17.680
 indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.

1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:19.820
 And I tossed in a little bit at the end there

1:48:19.820 --> 1:48:23.420
 also about ways that you can make your own fermented foods

1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:25.700
 at home in order to try and offset some of the costs.

1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:27.300
 Also, it's just kind of fun to do.

1:48:27.300 --> 1:48:29.560
 And some of those actually taste quite good.

1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:32.540
 I've actually found that the fermented sauerkraut

1:48:32.540 --> 1:48:35.460
 that we're making at home actually rivals the sauerkraut

1:48:35.460 --> 1:48:37.540
 that you can buy out of the refrigerated section

1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:39.260
 at the grocery store.

1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:42.980
 And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef

1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:45.600
 and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever.

1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:47.140
 So if I can do it, you can do it.

1:48:47.140 --> 1:48:49.060
 I hope you found this information useful

1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:51.780
 and perhaps also actionable.

1:48:51.780 --> 1:48:54.380
 One of my motivations for doing this episode

1:48:54.380 --> 1:48:56.820
 was, again, as a primer for the episode

1:48:56.820 --> 1:48:58.500
 with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg,

1:48:58.500 --> 1:49:00.740
 where we go really deep into the gut microbiome,

1:49:00.740 --> 1:49:02.560
 less so into the gut brain axis,

1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:04.480
 but really deep into the gut microbiome,

1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:06.540
 what it is, what it does, what it doesn't do,

1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:08.560
 and some of the emerging findings from his lab

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.220
 that are yet to be published.

1:49:10.220 --> 1:49:12.400
 And I also was excited to do this episode

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:14.400
 because I think many of us have heard

1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:15.620
 about the gut microbiome.

1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:17.860
 We hear about these bacteria that live in our gut.

1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:19.560
 We hear about the gut brain axis

1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:22.280
 or that 90% or more of the serotonin

1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:23.780
 that we make is made in our gut.

1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:26.460
 We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth.

1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:28.840
 But I think for many people,

1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:30.660
 they don't really have a clear picture

1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:32.380
 of what the gut microbiome is

1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:35.540
 and the pathways and mechanisms by which it can signal

1:49:35.540 --> 1:49:37.880
 to the brain and to the other parts of the body.

1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.420
 So I hope that today's information

1:49:39.420 --> 1:49:42.580
 at least improved the clarity around that topic

1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:44.600
 and leaves you with a more vivid picture

1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:48.180
 of this incredible system that is our gut brain axis.

 That's perhaps the best way to support this podcast.

1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:22.100
 And we have a Patreon.

1:50:22.100 --> 1:50:24.500
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:26.380
 and there you can support the podcast

1:50:26.380 --> 1:50:28.420
 at any level that you like.

1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:30.780
 On many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:50:30.780 --> 1:50:32.100
 we talk about supplements.

1:50:32.100 --> 1:50:34.300
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:50:34.300 --> 1:50:36.700
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:38.740
 One of the key issues with supplements, however,

1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:41.940
 is that the quality of supplements can vary tremendously

1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:45.120
 and oftentimes that relates to the precision,

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:46.640
 or I should say the lack of precision

1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:50.260
 with which companies put different amounts of supplements

1:50:50.260 --> 1:50:53.040
 in the capsules and tablets than are listed on the bottle.

1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:55.900
 For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:50:55.900 --> 1:50:58.240
 because Thorne supplements have the highest degree

1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:00.900
 of stringency in terms of the quality of ingredients

1:51:00.900 --> 1:51:03.460
 and the specificity of the amounts of the ingredients.

1:51:03.460 --> 1:51:05.820
 That is, what is listed on the bottle is actually

1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:08.360
 what is contained in the capsules and tablets and powders.

1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:10.420
 If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,

1:51:10.420 --> 1:51:13.780
 you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com,

1:51:13.780 --> 1:51:15.980
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:18.380
 and there you can see the Thorne supplements that I take.

1:51:18.380 --> 1:51:20.580
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements,

1:51:20.580 --> 1:51:22.940
 and if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site,

1:51:22.940 --> 1:51:25.560
 you can get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:26.500
 that Thorne makes.

1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:30.220
 That's thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.
