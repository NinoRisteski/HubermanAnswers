00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.560
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.560 --> 00:13.080
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.080 --> 00:15.120
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.040
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Craig Heller

00:18.040 --> 00:20.800
 as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.800
 Dr. Heller is a professor of biology

00:22.800 --> 00:25.240
 and neurosciences at Stanford.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.480
 His laboratory works on a range of topics,

00:27.480 --> 00:30.420
 including thermoregulation, down syndrome,

00:30.420 --> 00:32.120
 and circadian rhythms.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.400
 Today, we talk about thermoregulation,

00:34.400 --> 00:36.880
 how the body heats and cools itself

00:36.880 --> 00:39.660
 and maintains what we call homeostasis,

00:39.660 --> 00:41.760
 which is an equilibrium of processes

00:41.760 --> 00:43.560
 that keeps our neurons healthy,

00:43.560 --> 00:45.280
 our organs functioning well.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.000
 And as Dr. Heller teaches us,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.760
 thermoregulation can be leveraged

00:49.760 --> 00:53.380
 in order to greatly increase our performance in athletics

00:53.380 --> 00:55.700
 and mental performance as well.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.200
 Learning to control your core body temperature

00:58.200 --> 01:01.320
 is one of the most, if not the most powerful thing

01:01.320 --> 01:04.560
 that you can do to optimize mental and physical performance

01:04.560 --> 01:06.840
 regardless of the environment that you're in.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.720
 He also dispels many common myths

01:08.720 --> 01:10.880
 about heating and cooling the body,

01:10.880 --> 01:13.240
 including the idea that putting a cold pack

01:13.240 --> 01:15.080
 on your head or neck is the optimal way

01:15.080 --> 01:16.280
 to cool down quickly.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.880
 And in fact, as Dr. Heller tells us,

01:18.880 --> 01:20.480
 it actually can be counterproductive

01:20.480 --> 01:22.760
 and lead to hyperthermia.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.400
 It's a fascinating conversation

01:24.400 --> 01:26.160
 from which I learned a tremendous amount

01:26.160 --> 01:27.520
 of new information,

01:27.520 --> 01:29.560
 and we didn't even get into the other

01:29.560 --> 01:31.700
 incredibly interesting work that Dr. Heller does

01:31.700 --> 01:34.680
 on Down syndrome and circadian rhythms and sleep.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.320
 So we hope to have him back in the future

01:36.320 --> 01:38.400
 to discuss those topics.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.240
 As you'll soon see,

01:39.240 --> 01:41.480
 Dr. Heller is a wealth of knowledge

01:41.480 --> 01:44.760
 on all things human physiology, biology,

01:44.760 --> 01:46.400
 and human performance.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.240
 It's no surprise then that he's been

01:48.240 --> 01:51.200
 chair of the biology department at Stanford for many years,

01:51.200 --> 01:54.280
 as well as director of the human biology program.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.920
 So if you're interested in human biology

01:55.920 --> 01:57.860
 and how to improve your performance

01:57.860 --> 02:01.320
 in any context or setting, athletic or otherwise,

02:01.320 --> 02:04.160
 I think you'll very much enjoy today's conversation.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.000
 Before we begin,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.800
 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:06.800 --> 02:09.520
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.600
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

02:11.600 --> 02:13.520
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

02:13.520 --> 02:15.800
 about science and science related tools

02:15.800 --> 02:17.320
 to the general public.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.400
 In keeping with that theme,

02:18.400 --> 02:21.260
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.200
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.300
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:25.300 --> 02:27.860
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

02:27.860 --> 02:30.240
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.440
 I can tell you that the visual system

02:31.440 --> 02:32.640
 has to go through a lot of work

02:32.640 --> 02:35.360
 in order to maintain clarity of what you see

02:35.360 --> 02:36.760
 when there are shadows,

02:36.760 --> 02:38.600
 when you go into different types of indoor lighting

02:38.600 --> 02:39.440
 and so on.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.040
 And a lot of glasses don't work well

02:41.040 --> 02:44.280
 because you put them on and then you're in bright light

02:44.280 --> 02:46.040
 and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow

02:46.040 --> 02:47.160
 and then you have to take them off

02:47.160 --> 02:49.800
 and they don't adjust or they don't adjust quickly enough.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.720
 With Roca, their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed

02:52.720 --> 02:55.360
 with the visual system biology in mind.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.280
 So you always see things with perfect clarity.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.600
 The glasses are also terrific

02:58.600 --> 02:59.920
 because they're very lightweight

02:59.920 --> 03:02.280
 and they won't slip off your face if you're exercising,

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
 if you're running or biking.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.000
 In fact, they were designed for the purpose

03:05.000 --> 03:07.440
 of being able to be worn while you're engaging

03:07.440 --> 03:10.420
 in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.840
 I happen to wear readers at night

03:12.840 --> 03:14.360
 when I drive or when I work,

03:14.360 --> 03:15.800
 and I love their sunglasses

03:15.800 --> 03:17.280
 because I can wear them anywhere.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.600
 And also the aesthetics of their sunglasses

03:19.600 --> 03:20.920
 and eyeglasses are terrific.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.760
 Unlike a lot of other performance glasses

03:22.760 --> 03:25.180
 that frankly make people look like cyborgs,

03:25.180 --> 03:27.000
 the aesthetics on Roca's are really terrific.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.200
 You could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.680
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

03:42.040 --> 03:45.520
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.960
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

03:47.960 --> 03:50.360
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

03:50.360 --> 03:52.360
 to help you better understand your body

03:52.360 --> 03:54.320
 and help you reach your health goals.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.360
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.640
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

03:59.640 --> 04:01.600
 you can also analyze your DNA

04:01.600 --> 04:03.540
 to see what you ought to be doing

04:03.540 --> 04:05.920
 for your immediate and long-term health.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.760
 We hear a lot these days about optimization,

04:07.760 --> 04:09.960
 optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism,

04:09.960 --> 04:11.400
 optimizing this, optimizing that.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.440
 But unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors,

04:14.440 --> 04:17.960
 hormones, and other things that are in your blood and DNA,

04:17.960 --> 04:19.720
 you don't know what to optimize.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.520
 With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.720
 They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test,

04:24.720 --> 04:26.840
 or you can go to a nearby clinic.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.680
 They send you the information and you take those results.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.800
 And unlike a lot of laboratories

04:31.800 --> 04:34.040
 doing blood work out there and DNA tests,

04:34.040 --> 04:36.180
 they have a simple platform, a dashboard,

04:36.180 --> 04:38.160
 that walks you through your results

04:38.160 --> 04:40.560
 and helps you identify what sorts of nutritional

04:40.560 --> 04:42.880
 or behavioral or other types of practices

04:42.880 --> 04:44.600
 you might want to incorporate into your life

04:44.600 --> 04:46.500
 in order to positively impact

04:46.500 --> 04:48.480
 your immediate and long-term health.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.180
 It's a very easy system to use,

04:50.180 --> 04:51.760
 and you will gain a ton of information

04:51.760 --> 04:52.940
 simply by doing that test,

04:52.940 --> 04:54.340
 whether or not you end up making changes

04:54.340 --> 04:56.100
 to what you're doing or not.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.920
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:57.920 --> 05:00.960
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:00.960 --> 05:03.920

05:06.620 --> 05:09.720
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.260
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

05:11.260 --> 05:13.760
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.300
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,

05:16.300 --> 05:18.820
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.480
 The reason I started using Athletic Greens

05:20.480 --> 05:22.120
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

05:22.120 --> 05:23.640
 once or twice a day

05:23.640 --> 05:26.460
 is because it covers all of my nutritional bases.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.240
 In fact, if people ask me and I often am asked,

05:29.240 --> 05:31.120
 what supplement should I take?

05:31.120 --> 05:33.000
 I always recommend Athletic Greens.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.520
 And in fact, if you were to take just one supplement,

05:35.520 --> 05:38.160
 I recommend Athletic Greens for the simple reason

05:38.160 --> 05:41.940
 that the vitamins, minerals, and probiotics and adaptogens

05:41.940 --> 05:44.040
 cover all your nutritional bases

05:44.040 --> 05:46.900
 and the probiotics optimize gut brain health,

05:46.900 --> 05:49.560
 which we now know is essential for mood,

05:49.560 --> 05:52.260
 for immune system function, for metabolic function.

05:52.260 --> 05:54.600
 It's got so many great things in there.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.640
 I really do feel better

05:55.640 --> 05:57.280
 when I'm drinking my Athletic Greens.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.360
 I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice,

06:00.360 --> 06:03.960
 and as I mentioned before, I'll drink it once or twice a day.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.200
 If I travel, I might even drink it a third time

06:06.200 --> 06:09.720
 just because of the additional stress on my mind and body.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.040
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

06:11.040 --> 06:13.900
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:13.900 --> 06:15.480
 to claim a special offer.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.340
 They'll give you five free travel packs.

06:17.340 --> 06:19.320
 So these are travel packs that make it really easy

06:19.320 --> 06:20.320
 to mix up Athletic Greens

06:20.320 --> 06:23.040
 if you're on the plane or in the car.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.040
 And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.440
 There's now ample evidence that vitamin D3K2

06:30.440 --> 06:32.040
 is supportive of the immune system

06:32.040 --> 06:34.120
 and a bunch of other biological functions.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.700
 And K2 has been shown to be important

06:35.700 --> 06:37.140
 for cardiovascular health.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.860
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

06:39.860 --> 06:42.400
 you'll get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

06:42.400 --> 06:45.360
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.780
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Craig Heller.

06:48.780 --> 06:49.720
 Great to have you here.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.880
 It's good to be here.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.360
 It's been a long time coming.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.560
 I know that I and many people have a lot of questions

06:56.560 --> 06:58.860
 about the use of cold.

06:58.860 --> 07:02.440
 So one of the things that's happened in recent years

07:02.440 --> 07:05.640
 is that for many reasons,

07:05.640 --> 07:08.220
 people have become interested in things

07:08.220 --> 07:11.680
 like taking cold showers and taking ice baths

07:11.680 --> 07:13.760
 for many different purposes.

07:13.760 --> 07:18.240
 Sometimes this is introduced as just a general health tonic,

07:18.240 --> 07:20.760
 but other times people get specific

07:20.760 --> 07:22.840
 about how it can improve resilience

07:22.840 --> 07:25.660
 or it can improve one's metabolism.

07:27.040 --> 07:31.160
 Could you just tell me a little bit about what happens

07:31.160 --> 07:34.920
 when I get into a cold shower or an ice bath?

07:34.920 --> 07:36.920
 What are some of the basic responses

07:36.920 --> 07:38.860
 at the level of metabolism?

07:38.860 --> 07:41.500
 Obviously, psychologically, we don't know exactly.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.840
 It'll vary from person to person,

07:42.840 --> 07:46.160
 but what happens when I submerge myself into an ice bath

07:46.160 --> 07:48.220
 if I've never done it before?

07:49.120 --> 07:52.180
 Well, first of all, you get a tremendous shock.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.720
 And what that's going to translate into

07:54.720 --> 07:57.280
 is a bit of a shot of adrenaline.

07:57.280 --> 08:01.260
 And I think this is really the so-called benefit,

08:01.260 --> 08:04.620
 but I wouldn't call it a benefit of the cryochambers.

08:04.620 --> 08:06.800
 You go into a cryochamber and it's a shock,

08:06.800 --> 08:08.220
 so you get a shot of adrenaline.

08:08.220 --> 08:11.080
 So sure, you're going to feel different when you come out.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.880
 You've had a shot of adrenaline,

08:12.880 --> 08:16.840
 but it doesn't necessarily translate into any benefit

08:16.840 --> 08:21.040
 in terms of your physiology or performance and so forth.

08:21.040 --> 08:25.400
 Now, if you take a cold bath or a cold shower,

08:25.400 --> 08:26.980
 a couple of things are happening.

08:26.980 --> 08:30.440
 One is you're going to stimulate vasoconstriction.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.040
 So if anything, it's going to make it

08:32.040 --> 08:34.080
 a little bit more difficult for your body

08:34.080 --> 08:37.120
 to get rid of heat because you're shutting off

08:37.120 --> 08:40.240
 your avenues of heat loss.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.520
 If you're in a true cold bath,

08:43.520 --> 08:47.440
 the overall surface area of your body is so great

08:47.440 --> 08:49.840
 that it doesn't matter if you've vasoconstricted,

08:49.840 --> 08:51.320
 you're still going to lose heat.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.120
 Okay, so vasoconstriction, the constriction of,

08:55.120 --> 08:58.780
 is it capillaries, vessels, and arteries all constrict

08:58.780 --> 09:01.680
 or just one or two?

09:01.680 --> 09:05.340
 Well, this is an area of controversy.

09:05.340 --> 09:07.840
 In general, when people talk of vasoconstriction,

09:07.840 --> 09:10.360
 they talk of the overall skin surface,

09:10.360 --> 09:11.760
 and that is not true.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.140
 The primary sites of heat loss,

09:15.140 --> 09:17.080
 which we're going to get into,

09:17.080 --> 09:20.220
 are the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet,

09:20.220 --> 09:22.280
 and the upper part of your face.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.760
 And the reason these are avenues for heat loss

09:25.760 --> 09:28.880
 is they're underlain by special blood vessels.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.760
 And these blood vessels are able to shunt the blood

09:32.760 --> 09:35.760
 from the arteries, which are coming from the heart,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.960
 directly to the veins, which are returning to the heart,

09:38.960 --> 09:40.880
 and bypassing the capillaries,

09:40.880 --> 09:44.560
 which are the nutritive vessels, but high resistance.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.240
 So you can tell when you shake someone's hand

09:47.240 --> 09:49.700
 what his or her thermal status is,

09:49.700 --> 09:51.400
 the hand's hot or it's cold.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.240
 And sometimes it's-

09:52.240 --> 09:53.060
 Do you think that's part of the reason

09:53.060 --> 09:56.640
 why humans evolved this practice of shaking hands,

09:56.640 --> 09:58.520
 assessing each other's level of anxiety?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.040
 We all know that a limp handshake

10:00.040 --> 10:02.360
 is pretty indicative of something,

10:02.360 --> 10:04.480
 and a firm handshake is indicative of something,

10:04.480 --> 10:07.360
 as is the crushing handshake for that matter, right?

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
 Yeah, I really don't know

10:08.360 --> 10:10.880
 what the evolutionary origin of handshaking is

10:10.880 --> 10:14.720
 other than to get your hand away from your weapon, perhaps.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.720
 Right, a couple of questions

10:16.720 --> 10:21.320
 before we get into these specialized vascular compartments

10:21.320 --> 10:24.840
 on the soles, the palms, and the upper face.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.160
 You mentioned whole body immersion, like into an ice bath

10:28.160 --> 10:31.880
 or very cold water up to the neck versus a cold shower.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.560
 Is there something fundamentally different about those two

10:34.560 --> 10:36.280
 besides the fact that they both provide

10:36.280 --> 10:37.780
 this release of adrenaline?

10:37.780 --> 10:40.900
 Is there anything that's really important to understand

10:40.900 --> 10:43.700
 about the difference in the physiological response

10:43.700 --> 10:48.480
 evoked by cold shower versus immersion in cold?

10:48.480 --> 10:51.380
 Well, there are differences that are more physical

10:51.380 --> 10:52.400
 than anything else.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.420
 So if you are in a cold bath and you're still,

10:55.420 --> 10:57.740
 you develop a boundary layer.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.080
 If you're in a shower, you can't develop a boundary layer.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.800
 Could you explain what a boundary layer is?

11:01.800 --> 11:06.080
 Yes, it's best to explain it in terms of a hot bath

11:06.080 --> 11:08.000
 because everybody's experienced that.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.600
 You get into a hot bath and oh my God, it's really hot,

11:11.600 --> 11:14.640
 almost painful, and then you sit down

11:14.640 --> 11:17.760
 and eventually it doesn't feel so hot anymore

11:17.760 --> 11:21.880
 because the still water, which is close to your skin,

11:21.880 --> 11:24.200
 is coming into equilibrium with your skin.

11:24.200 --> 11:28.360
 So it's like having a blanket on you or an insulator on you.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.560
 And then if you move around, you disturb that still water

11:32.560 --> 11:35.880
 layer, you feel the hot temperature again.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.720
 I see.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.760
 So if I were to get into a cold ice bath

11:38.760 --> 11:43.000
 or a very cold body of water of some kind and stay still,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.840
 I'd likely feel warmer, at least until I start-

11:45.840 --> 11:47.700
 You're not going to be losing as much heat.

11:47.700 --> 11:48.540
 I see.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.360
 And then when I move it, I'll say-

11:49.360 --> 11:51.100
 If you flail around, if you flail around,

11:51.100 --> 11:52.440
 then you're going to lose more heat.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.280
 Got it.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.100
 Yeah.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.640
 But I think getting back to your original question

11:55.640 --> 11:58.800
 about benefits, you have to keep in mind

11:58.800 --> 12:01.760
 whether you're talking about aerobic activity

12:01.760 --> 12:05.440
 or anaerobic activity, if you're referring to performance

12:05.440 --> 12:07.440
 and exercise and so forth.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.960
 So if you're doing aerobic activity that you can sustain

12:10.960 --> 12:15.960
 for a long time, your production of heat is rising gradually

12:16.640 --> 12:19.600
 and is being distributed throughout your body.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.060
 So eventually your body temperature is going to come up

12:22.060 --> 12:25.240
 to a level that's going to impair your performance.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.160
 So the benefit of a cold bath or a cold shower

12:28.160 --> 12:32.620
 before aerobic activity is that you increase the capacity

12:32.620 --> 12:35.960
 of your body mass to absorb that excess heat.

12:35.960 --> 12:36.800
 I see.

12:36.800 --> 12:41.220
 So could you say that in a rough sense that a protocol

12:41.220 --> 12:43.160
 that one might use if they're going to head out

12:43.160 --> 12:47.000
 for a long run, even on a reasonably warm day,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.680
 not super hot, or maybe it is super hot,

12:49.680 --> 12:52.980
 would be to take a cool shower before they go run?

12:52.980 --> 12:53.820
 Would that be beneficial?

12:53.820 --> 12:56.860
 Sure, it'll take them longer to get to the sweat point

12:56.860 --> 12:57.760
 and to heat up.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.040
 And what will that translate to

12:59.040 --> 13:01.680
 in terms of a performance benefit?

13:01.680 --> 13:04.000
 Well, could increase your speed,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.880
 or it depends on how you use that benefit.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.040
 Some people are pacers, they will go at the same pace

13:10.040 --> 13:12.040
 and then they will go farther.

13:12.040 --> 13:17.040
 Or some people are, I want to say, pacers and regulators.

13:17.160 --> 13:22.000
 And no, no, pacers or forcers, they will take that advantage

13:22.000 --> 13:23.860
 and use it up as fast as they can.

13:23.860 --> 13:27.420
 So they will go faster, but not necessarily farther.

13:27.420 --> 13:28.260
 I see.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.400
 As far as I know, not many athletes,

13:30.400 --> 13:31.760
 at least not the ones that I know,

13:31.760 --> 13:33.600
 are getting into cool bodies of water,

13:33.600 --> 13:36.240
 taking cold showers before they head out to train.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.260
 But it sounds like there could be

13:37.260 --> 13:39.140
 a real performance benefit there.

13:39.140 --> 13:40.640
 It could be a benefit.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.680
 I know we're going to talk about our technology for cooling,

13:44.680 --> 13:47.960
 but at one point, I don't know if they're using it now,

13:47.960 --> 13:49.600
 but our cross-country team,

13:49.600 --> 13:51.720
 when they would go to compete in a very hot place,

13:51.720 --> 13:55.160
 they would do their warmup exercises, their stretching,

13:55.160 --> 13:57.780
 then they would extract heat

13:57.780 --> 13:59.760
 before the beginning of the race.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.240
 So I like to think of it as you have greater scope

14:03.240 --> 14:04.820
 for heat absorption.

14:04.820 --> 14:07.280
 Interesting, about how long would one need

14:07.280 --> 14:09.960
 to take one of these showers or cold immersions

14:09.960 --> 14:11.200
 before heading out for a run?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.360
 Roughly speaking, we don't have to get into details

14:13.360 --> 14:16.360
 because everyone's performance level and regimen

14:16.360 --> 14:17.200
 is going to be different,

14:17.200 --> 14:18.720
 where they live is going to be different, et cetera.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.600
 Right, it's not as long as you think, it's minutes.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.440
 Couple minutes.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.640
 Yeah, because what's going to happen

14:24.640 --> 14:27.920
 is as your core temperature goes down,

14:27.920 --> 14:30.920
 you will eventually shut off your heat loss

14:30.920 --> 14:35.220
 and that keeps it from going below normal.

14:35.220 --> 14:39.580
 So if you've warmed up and your temperature has risen

14:39.580 --> 14:41.760
 by half a degree, let's say,

14:41.760 --> 14:43.700
 it doesn't take more than a few minutes

14:43.700 --> 14:46.440
 to extract that heat if you're vasodilated.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.920
 Interesting, and what about for the anaerobic athlete,

14:49.920 --> 14:50.760
 the strength athlete?

14:50.760 --> 14:53.000
 Right, for the anaerobic athlete,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
 and let's say they're doing several sets

14:59.600 --> 15:01.800
 and how many reps, whatever they're doing,

15:02.720 --> 15:05.360
 their core temperature is not going to rise that fast

15:05.360 --> 15:08.840
 because it's only certain muscles which are being used,

15:08.840 --> 15:11.820
 but the temperature of those muscles will go up.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.080
 So it's a local effect?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.720
 It's a local effect, right.

15:14.720 --> 15:18.520
 So let's say for sake of today, maybe for this discussion,

15:18.520 --> 15:21.200
 if we assume that the basic workout,

15:21.200 --> 15:22.780
 even though people do variation on this,

15:22.780 --> 15:26.200
 is five sets of five or 10 sets of 10.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.680
 So for those listening, it would be five sets

15:29.680 --> 15:34.080
 of five repetitions or 10 sets of 10 repetitions,

15:34.080 --> 15:36.080
 10 by 10, five by five, yeah.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.940
 So if somebody, let's say,

15:37.940 --> 15:41.360
 is doing a large body compound movement

15:41.360 --> 15:44.040
 like barbell squats where there are a lot

15:44.040 --> 15:46.700
 of large body movements, hip hinging and et cetera,

15:46.700 --> 15:51.700
 but for instance, the biceps are not,

15:52.480 --> 15:54.700
 they're involved, but more or less indirectly.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.600
 Right.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.380
 So the effect is going to be to heat up the quadriceps,

15:58.380 --> 16:00.420
 heat up the hamstrings, heat up the glutes,

16:00.420 --> 16:01.260
 this kind of thing.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.580
 Right. I see.

16:02.580 --> 16:06.740
 And then during rest, that heat will leave the muscle,

16:06.740 --> 16:09.780
 but it's not fast, and certainly the heat

16:09.780 --> 16:12.580
 can't leave the muscle very fast while you're working out

16:12.580 --> 16:14.460
 because when the muscle contracts,

16:14.460 --> 16:18.180
 it squeezes the blood vessels, and the only way heat gets

16:18.180 --> 16:20.460
 out of a muscle is in the blood,

16:20.460 --> 16:23.100
 and your muscle metabolism can go up 50

16:23.100 --> 16:25.860
 or 60 fold during anaerobic activity.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.220
 That means the heat production

16:27.220 --> 16:30.020
 in the muscle goes up 50 or 60 fold.

16:30.020 --> 16:34.580
 The blood flow to that muscle cannot go up 50 or 60 fold.

16:34.580 --> 16:38.220
 So you literally have the capacity to cook your muscles.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.740
 So this is probably an appropriate time

16:41.740 --> 16:45.340
 to mention briefly what the underlying mechanism of this is.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.960
 Could you just, we will return to the specifics

16:47.960 --> 16:51.300
 of what one can do to mitigate this heating up,

16:51.300 --> 16:54.260
 but could you just explain the relationship

16:54.260 --> 16:58.100
 between energy production ATP and pyruvate kinase

16:58.100 --> 17:00.040
 and the role of heat there?

17:00.040 --> 17:00.880
 Sure.

17:02.380 --> 17:05.160
 We don't get something for nothing.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.180
 So like a steam engine,

17:07.180 --> 17:11.980
 most of the energy in our food is lost as heat.

17:11.980 --> 17:15.100
 So we are roughly about 20% efficient.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.820
 So of the energy that we take in in our food,

17:17.820 --> 17:20.420
 about 20% of that can go into doing work,

17:20.420 --> 17:22.880
 and the rest of it is lost as heat.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.520
 Now, we're mammals.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.980
 We use that heat to keep our body temperature

17:26.980 --> 17:29.500
 considerably above the environment.

17:29.500 --> 17:34.140
 But if you raise body temperature a few degrees higher,

17:34.140 --> 17:35.640
 you're in trouble.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.820
 That's hyperthermia.

17:37.820 --> 17:41.740
 So individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits

17:41.740 --> 17:45.500
 before you might experience it in the whole body.

17:45.500 --> 17:50.500
 So to keep you from damaging your muscle by hyperthermia,

17:50.660 --> 17:52.580
 we have fail-safe mechanisms.

17:52.580 --> 17:56.340
 And one of those fail-safe mechanisms is an enzyme

17:56.340 --> 17:59.540
 which is critical for getting fuel,

17:59.540 --> 18:04.420
 in other words, the results of metabolism of glucose,

18:04.420 --> 18:06.840
 getting that fuel into the mitochondria,

18:06.840 --> 18:11.800
 which is making our major coinage of energy exchange ATP.

18:12.740 --> 18:16.820
 So that particular enzyme is temperature sensitive.

18:16.820 --> 18:20.660
 So when the muscle temperature gets above 39 or 35,

18:20.660 --> 18:22.100
 it shuts off.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.300
 And that essentially shuts off the fuel supply

18:25.300 --> 18:26.400
 to the mitochondria.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.920
 That's when you cannot do one more rep.

18:28.920 --> 18:32.340
 So failure, could we say that one component

18:32.340 --> 18:36.180
 of muscular failure is overheating of the muscle locally?

18:36.180 --> 18:37.940
 There are probably other things too.

18:37.940 --> 18:40.540
 Well, yeah, if you lack oxygen,

18:40.540 --> 18:45.020
 but our oxygen delivery is pretty good to the muscle.

18:45.020 --> 18:48.220
 If you run out of glucose, yeah, that's going to impair you.

18:48.220 --> 18:53.220
 But the most immediate impairment of muscle activity,

18:53.840 --> 18:55.580
 muscle fatigue, in other words,

18:55.580 --> 18:57.700
 is the rise in temperature of the muscle.

18:57.700 --> 18:58.520
 Interesting.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.280
 I want to talk about how that muscle fails locally,

19:02.280 --> 19:04.460
 but I have this burning question in my mind

19:04.460 --> 19:07.980
 that I cannot seem to answer for myself.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.420
 I'm hoping you can answer it for me.

19:09.420 --> 19:13.040
 So let's say I'm doing five sets of five with squats.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.320
 I hit muscular failure at a given weight.

19:17.320 --> 19:21.400
 And according to what I now know,

19:21.400 --> 19:24.480
 it's my quadriceps and the muscles associated

19:24.480 --> 19:26.060
 with the squat that have failed

19:26.060 --> 19:29.860
 because of this mechanism triggered by heat

19:29.860 --> 19:31.660
 that shuts off the muscle.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.380
 But my biceps are nice and cool, you're telling me.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.060
 They're not doing too much work.

19:36.060 --> 19:37.500
 It's only indirect work.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.940
 So why is it that I can't set the bar down

19:40.940 --> 19:45.000
 in the squat rack, walk over and do barbell curls

19:45.000 --> 19:47.640
 with the same intensity that I could

19:47.640 --> 19:51.040
 if I were to do those barbell curls fresh,

19:51.040 --> 19:52.980
 not having done anything prior?

19:52.980 --> 19:55.460
 Well, you will still have a fatigue curve

19:55.460 --> 19:58.540
 with your upper body, okay?

19:58.540 --> 20:02.340
 And that will be influenced by any rise in temperature

20:02.340 --> 20:06.100
 that has been generated by your lower body exercise.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.900
 So temperature in both cases is the limiting factor.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.060
 It's one limiting factor.

20:12.060 --> 20:13.300
 It's one limiting factor.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.660
 I find that amazing.

20:14.660 --> 20:18.700
 I find that amazing because I always thought naively

20:18.700 --> 20:20.700
 that the reason muscles fail is because we, quote,

20:20.700 --> 20:23.380
 "'Don't have the strength to do another repetition'

20:23.380 --> 20:25.100
 or it's that you lack glycogen

20:25.100 --> 20:28.560
 or some ability to access that glycogen."

20:28.560 --> 20:30.980
 But of course we still have glycogen.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.180
 It's naive for me to think that

20:32.180 --> 20:34.500
 because if I wait three minutes and go back,

20:34.500 --> 20:35.920
 I can do those repetitions again.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.560
 So the glycogen wasn't restored in that three minutes.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.180
 Obviously it was there.

20:40.180 --> 20:42.980
 So I realized there might be other mechanisms involved.

20:42.980 --> 20:46.940
 Sounds like heat is if not the dominant mechanism

20:46.940 --> 20:49.220
 that prevents more work.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.500
 It's one of them.

20:50.500 --> 20:55.980
 It's one of them and it's a quick one, it's a fast one.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.420
 So it can happen with,

20:57.420 --> 21:01.820
 let's say you are a really experienced weightlifter, okay?

21:01.820 --> 21:04.380
 You may be doing very, very high weights

21:04.380 --> 21:07.540
 with sets of five or six.

21:07.540 --> 21:08.740
 Yeah, to be clear for the audience,

21:08.740 --> 21:11.540
 I'm not doing very high weights with sets of five.

21:11.540 --> 21:14.800
 Not particularly strong, I'm not super weak,

21:14.800 --> 21:15.700
 but I'm not particularly strong.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.020
 But Craig's referring in the general sense to you.

21:19.020 --> 21:24.020
 So why is it that if I finish a set of squats,

21:24.980 --> 21:27.800
 I can't simply cool off my quadriceps

21:27.800 --> 21:31.380
 by throwing a nice cool towel on my quadriceps?

21:31.380 --> 21:34.500
 Why is that not the best way to go about it?

21:34.500 --> 21:39.100
 Because your body surface is a very good insulator, okay?

21:39.100 --> 21:40.860
 We think we don't have fur

21:40.860 --> 21:42.640
 and therefore we're not insulated.

21:42.640 --> 21:47.640
 But the skin, the fascia, the muscles underneath,

21:47.640 --> 21:50.960
 underneath, they're all very good insulators.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.560
 And that's why I said earlier

21:52.560 --> 21:54.840
 that the way the heat gets out of the muscle

21:54.840 --> 21:56.580
 is in the blood.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.480
 So I want to step through a couple other portals

21:59.480 --> 22:02.680
 by which one might think that heating and cooling

22:02.680 --> 22:05.000
 would be ideal and then get back

22:05.000 --> 22:08.240
 to these specialized surfaces on the hands,

22:08.240 --> 22:09.720
 the feet, and the face.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.880
 So if throwing a cold towel or even ice cold towel

22:12.880 --> 22:14.320
 on my quadriceps isn't going to work

22:14.320 --> 22:15.440
 or standing in front of the fan

22:15.440 --> 22:17.200
 because I'm insulated from that cool,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.320
 I can't cool off my blood fast enough.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.680
 What about drinking 16 ounces of ice water?

22:22.680 --> 22:23.520
 Sure, you can do that,

22:23.520 --> 22:27.600
 but you can calculate how much heat that can absorb.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.040
 And you can't continue drinking liters of ice water.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.480
 You're going to dilute your blood and have other problems.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.760
 But yes, it'll help.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.960
 Sure, it will help.

22:36.960 --> 22:41.960
 But it doesn't have the full capacity you will need.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.520
 What about an ice pack to the back of my neck

22:44.520 --> 22:47.640
 or to my head or squeezing the cold sponge over the head?

22:47.640 --> 22:50.240
 I'm deliberately moving through these options

22:50.240 --> 22:52.440
 because these are the ones that we see most often.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.540
 We were actually just watching

22:53.540 --> 22:55.600
 the Olympic track and field trials last night

22:55.600 --> 22:56.440
 up in Oregon.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.820
 I'm a huge track and field fan.

22:57.820 --> 23:02.820
 And there were a lot of sponges on the backs of necks

23:03.080 --> 23:05.340
 before and between and after events.

23:05.340 --> 23:10.340
 And how good is that or how poor is that as a strategy?

23:10.860 --> 23:13.280
 Since now we know that being overheated

23:13.280 --> 23:15.400
 locally and systemically throughout the body

23:15.400 --> 23:18.300
 is a serious limiting factor on performance.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.060
 Well, you have to understand something

23:20.060 --> 23:22.880
 about our thermoregulatory system.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.620
 We have a thermostat,

23:24.620 --> 23:26.840
 just like you have a thermostat in your house.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.160
 And that thermostat is in the brain, okay?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.680
 Do we know the specific site?

23:31.680 --> 23:32.500
 Yes. Yes.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.580
 It's called the preoptic anterior hypothalamus.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.320
 It does many things in terms of physiological regulation,

23:39.320 --> 23:41.760
 but it serves as a thermostat.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.060
 Now that thermostat has to have information.

23:44.060 --> 23:45.700
 It has to have input.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.400
 Where does that input come from?

23:47.400 --> 23:49.500
 It comes from our overall body surface

23:49.500 --> 23:52.040
 where we sense temperature, okay?

23:52.040 --> 23:55.760
 So one of the things that can happen when you're overheated

23:55.760 --> 24:00.000
 is that you can send in a cold stimulus to your thermostat.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.760
 And that's sort of like wanting to cool your house

24:02.760 --> 24:06.040
 by putting a wet washcloth over your thermostat.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.840
 No, it's doing the wrong thing.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.720
 So we've actually had experiences

24:10.720 --> 24:14.040
 where we've had people exercising, getting overheated,

24:14.040 --> 24:16.020
 and then cooling the body surface.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.960
 And they say, it feels great.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.200
 This is fantastic.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.040
 And their core temperature's going up.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.920
 Well, I think this is such an important point.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.000
 First of all, I was weaned in a laboratory

24:26.000 --> 24:27.460
 where there were always battles

24:27.460 --> 24:29.640
 over the temperature in the lab.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.040
 So people were always putting ice packs on thermostats

24:33.040 --> 24:35.120
 or putting fans towards thermostats

24:35.120 --> 24:36.520
 and trying to play this game.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.560
 Good to know we were all being foolish,

24:38.560 --> 24:40.680
 even though we were neurobiologists.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.320
 Putting a cold towel over my torso

24:45.320 --> 24:47.960
 or putting ice on the back of my upper back,

24:47.960 --> 24:51.840
 you're saying could actually heat up my core.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.120
 It'll at least decrease your heat loss,

24:55.120 --> 24:56.960
 your rate of heat loss.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.880
 You're going to raise the issue a little later, I know,

25:00.880 --> 25:04.120
 and that is our natural portals for heat loss.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.280
 So you can think of the natural portals for heat loss

25:07.280 --> 25:09.480
 as our air conditioners, okay?

25:09.480 --> 25:11.120
 The thermostats in the brain

25:11.120 --> 25:13.680
 and the information to the thermostat

25:13.680 --> 25:16.400
 is coming from the overall body surface.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.720
 So what can happen if you, let's say,

25:18.720 --> 25:21.360
 cool the torso with an ice vest,

25:21.360 --> 25:25.640
 you can actually cause vasoconstriction of your portals,

25:25.640 --> 25:27.160
 your heat loss portals.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.560
 So that's what impairs the rate at which you're losing heat.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.820
 It feels good.

25:31.820 --> 25:34.220
 Now back to the head.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.960
 That's really interesting.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.080
 The major blood flow to the brain

25:38.080 --> 25:41.440
 comes up four arteries through the neck.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.080
 There's the carotid arteries

25:43.080 --> 25:45.220
 and there's the vertebral arteries.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.060
 So when you put a cold towel around the neck,

25:48.060 --> 25:53.060
 you're going to be putting a cold stimulus into the brain.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.340
 Well, that's great for protecting the brain.

25:55.340 --> 25:57.080
 You want to protect the brain,

25:57.080 --> 26:01.440
 but it's also going to make you feel cooler than you are.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.620
 So you will think you're ready to go again quickly

26:04.620 --> 26:09.200
 when you've just essentially cooled the thermostat.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.520
 This is an important point.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.320
 And there's a lot of interest nowadays

26:13.320 --> 26:14.640
 in people doing marathons

26:14.640 --> 26:16.480
 and there are even some people do these ultras,

26:16.480 --> 26:18.240
 ultra running, which I guess is everything longer

26:18.240 --> 26:21.840
 than a marathon and last man standing,

26:21.840 --> 26:24.580
 last man, last woman standing kind of thing.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.480
 So you're saying that if somebody is hyperthermic,

26:27.480 --> 26:31.400
 they could trick themselves into subjectively thinking

26:31.400 --> 26:33.880
 that they are cooling off by putting a cold towel

26:33.880 --> 26:36.380
 and that they can go further, but their brain could cook.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.000
 Well, if they stop the cooling,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.880
 then that hot blood from the body core

26:39.880 --> 26:41.360
 is going to go to the brain.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.240
 Interesting.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.880
 Well, it's a bit of a tangent,

26:44.880 --> 26:48.920
 but many people report after long bouts of exercise

26:48.920 --> 26:51.760
 or even just very intense bouts of exercise,

26:51.760 --> 26:54.720
 feeling a kind of brain fog or mental fatigue.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.160
 I assumed that that was due

26:58.160 --> 27:01.880
 to lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise,

27:01.880 --> 27:05.080
 but is it possible that there are some post-exercise effects

27:05.080 --> 27:06.840
 on heating and cooling of the brain

27:06.840 --> 27:09.080
 that might impact cognition

27:09.080 --> 27:11.560
 or I should say negatively impact cognition?

27:11.560 --> 27:14.120
 It's certainly possible because we know

27:14.120 --> 27:19.120
 that a rise in temperature decreases cognitive capacity.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.000
 I mean, you can experience that yourself.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.400
 You can get on a treadmill and follow your temperature

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
 and then just do a simple activity

27:27.400 --> 27:29.360
 like adding and subtracting.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.600
 You get to about 39 degrees,

27:31.600 --> 27:33.320
 so you can't do that anymore.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.120
 You can't just calculate

27:35.120 --> 27:36.700
 how long you've been on the treadmill.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.400
 So the phrase cool, common, collected is-

27:39.400 --> 27:40.240
 Cool, common, collected.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.200
 That's the goal in all pursuits.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.600
 That's right.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.080
 So I want to talk about these portals

27:47.080 --> 27:49.120
 because you've mentioned them a few times.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.260
 Before I ask about what the portals are exactly

27:53.260 --> 27:54.960
 and how they work and how they can be leveraged

27:54.960 --> 27:57.000
 for performance, there's a question

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
 that my neurobiologist self can't resist but ask.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.040
 We have this thermostat in the preoptic area

28:05.040 --> 28:07.240
 of the hypothalamus, which is interesting to me.

28:07.240 --> 28:10.000
 The medial preoptic area is also one

28:10.000 --> 28:12.640
 that's known to be sexually dimorphic

28:12.640 --> 28:16.400
 depending on testosterone exposure early in life, et cetera.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.840
 Although people should just note

28:18.840 --> 28:20.600
 that it's not actually testosterone

28:20.600 --> 28:23.240
 that creates these sexual dimorphisms, these differences.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.040
 It's actually testosterone converted into estrogen.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.800
 It's actually estrogen is the effector,

28:27.800 --> 28:29.480
 which is fascinating.

28:29.480 --> 28:33.400
 Nonetheless, we've got this area that acts as a thermostat,

28:33.400 --> 28:35.920
 and you said it's collecting information

28:35.920 --> 28:37.840
 from the whole body.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.160
 Does that mean that there are pathways

28:40.160 --> 28:43.500
 as the neuroscientists like you and I refer to them

28:43.500 --> 28:46.080
 as these afferent or input pathways

28:46.080 --> 28:48.600
 from the body to the preoptic area?

28:48.600 --> 28:51.640
 Is there a map of our body in the preoptic area?

28:51.640 --> 28:55.000
 Because I have to imagine that you can't have

28:55.000 --> 28:57.360
 the information just coming from the left shoulder,

28:57.360 --> 28:58.560
 just from the right toe.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.480
 It sounds like you need probably a pretty crude map,

29:02.480 --> 29:05.160
 but that you need a complete map of the body surface there.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.680
 Well, you don't need a complete map in the hypothalamus.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.600
 I mean, that thermal afferent information that you mentioned,

29:11.600 --> 29:14.800
 it also goes to the somatosensory cortex.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.940
 So you know if an ice cube has touched you on the back,

29:19.780 --> 29:23.200
 but that doesn't necessarily translate into a change

29:23.200 --> 29:27.360
 in let's say you're shivering or sweating.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.600
 So the information that's going to the hypothalamus

29:31.600 --> 29:36.360
 is more integrated, representation of body temperature.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.040
 So it's sort of an average of what's happening

29:38.040 --> 29:39.560
 across the body. It's an average.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.580
 So if I were to, let's say I get hot on a hot day

29:42.580 --> 29:44.520
 and popsicles when we were in summer camp,

29:44.520 --> 29:46.440
 I went to a sports camp near here actually,

29:46.440 --> 29:47.880
 and we'd run around like crazy,

29:47.880 --> 29:49.320
 and then we'd get into the shade if we could,

29:49.320 --> 29:50.880
 but we were popsicles.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.880
 Brain freeze.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.260
 Or the kids were putting ice cubes down each other's shirts

29:55.260 --> 29:58.120
 or something, but that's an average

29:58.120 --> 30:00.600
 because other parts of the body aren't exposed.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.000
 The mouth is exposed to the ice in the popsicle case

30:03.000 --> 30:05.640
 or the cold cubes or in the hands.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.480
 As you said, it feels really good.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.320
 It feels good, yeah.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.640
 But it sounds like it feels deceptively good

30:11.640 --> 30:16.600
 because in reality, it could still be quite warm internally.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.240
 Absolutely, yeah.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.080
 Interesting.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.980
 You can feel great and have a dangerously

30:22.980 --> 30:24.440
 hyperthermic temperature.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.220
 But I should say that when you get into the danger zone,

30:28.220 --> 30:29.680
 things get bad fast.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.720
 What are some of the symptoms

30:30.720 --> 30:34.240
 that people could be on the lookout for, for hyperthermia?

30:34.240 --> 30:36.800
 Essentially, it's almost ironic

30:36.800 --> 30:41.800
 that if individuals are transitioning into heat stroke,

30:42.540 --> 30:46.580
 they actually vasoconstrict and they stop sweating.

30:46.580 --> 30:50.260
 And that's a pathological situation.

30:50.260 --> 30:53.080
 I couldn't begin to explain it.

30:53.080 --> 30:57.940
 But essentially, you are just feeling exhausted.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.280
 You're feeling miserable.

31:03.460 --> 31:06.060
 The heart rate is very high.

31:06.060 --> 31:09.320
 Your heart rate goes up as your core temperature goes up,

31:10.340 --> 31:11.860
 called cardiac drift.

31:11.860 --> 31:15.880
 So you just feel rotten.

31:16.940 --> 31:21.540
 But that's why, since it's not a danger signal

31:21.540 --> 31:23.900
 that you can translate immediately into,

31:23.900 --> 31:25.900
 nope, I'm going into heat stroke,

31:25.900 --> 31:29.100
 that's why people can overcome their bad feeling

31:29.100 --> 31:32.540
 with motivation to continue going, to work harder.

31:32.540 --> 31:37.540
 So there have been a number of high profile athletic deaths

31:37.540 --> 31:42.120
 due to heat stroke that were during practice,

31:42.120 --> 31:45.360
 not in competition when people are really trying to do it,

31:45.360 --> 31:46.880
 but in practice,

31:46.880 --> 31:50.480
 which shows they were just motivated to push.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.880
 So let's talk about these magnificent portals

31:53.880 --> 31:56.920
 that not just humans, but other animals,

31:56.920 --> 31:58.760
 mammals are equipped with.

31:58.760 --> 32:02.320
 So if putting cold on the neck or on the head

32:02.320 --> 32:06.440
 or on the torso is not optimal, what is optimal?

32:06.440 --> 32:10.820
 And maybe walk us through a theory

32:10.820 --> 32:12.920
 as to why we would have these portals

32:12.920 --> 32:14.280
 located where they are,

32:14.280 --> 32:16.800
 and then we can talk about how one might leverage them

32:16.800 --> 32:18.160
 for performance.

32:18.160 --> 32:23.160
 Okay, where the portals are are in the glabrous skin,

32:23.680 --> 32:25.400
 big word, okay?

32:25.400 --> 32:28.080
 Glabrous just means no hair.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.600
 So it's the hairless skin.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.980
 You say, well, most of my body is without hair.

32:32.980 --> 32:36.880
 No, most of your body has hair follicles.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.240
 We are mammals.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.860
 Mammals have fur.

32:39.860 --> 32:43.240
 We've lost the fur, but we still have those,

32:43.240 --> 32:46.260
 that hairy skin phenotype all over our body,

32:46.260 --> 32:50.100
 except, except for those skin surfaces

32:50.100 --> 32:53.880
 where our mammal relatives didn't have fur.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.000
 So the pads of the feet.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.920
 And for the primates, upper part of the face.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.240
 For rabbits, no portions of the ears,

33:02.240 --> 33:03.080
 the inner surface of the ears.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.160
 No, I never thought about that.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.800
 For bears, not the tongue.

33:06.800 --> 33:10.000
 Bears have big tongues, huge tongues.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.880
 I didn't know that either.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.440
 I'm in that close to a bear yet.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.960
 Yeah, I've had a licking match with a bear.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.480
 Not yet, no.

33:17.480 --> 33:22.480
 So anyway, our mammalian relatives

33:23.200 --> 33:26.480
 can't lose heat over their overall body surface.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.180
 So probably very early on in mammalian evolution,

33:30.180 --> 33:32.600
 they evolved these special blood vessels

33:32.600 --> 33:36.200
 in the limited surface areas that don't have fur.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.840
 And as I said, what these blood vessels are

33:38.840 --> 33:42.160
 are shunts between the arteries and the veins.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.520
 Arteries and veins are both low resistance vessels.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.480
 So you can have high flow rate.

33:47.480 --> 33:50.840
 Capillaries, which normally are between arteries and veins,

33:50.840 --> 33:54.240
 are high resistance because they're very tiny, okay?

33:54.240 --> 33:57.400
 Is it fair to say that what I was taught

33:57.400 --> 34:01.640
 is that blood flows from arteries, then to capillaries,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.720
 and then to veins, and then back to the heart.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.940
 So it's sort of like from the heart through arteries,

34:05.940 --> 34:07.760
 then through these little capillaries,

34:07.760 --> 34:09.660
 which are like little estuaries and streams,

34:09.660 --> 34:11.400
 and then to the veins, back to the heart.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.800
 Is that generally true?

34:12.800 --> 34:13.800
 Yeah, absolutely.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.080
 So what I learned in basic physiology is still,

34:16.080 --> 34:18.640
 I wouldn't get an F in your class.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.600
 No.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.600
 Maybe a D or a C, but not an F.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.440
 So that's excellent.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.520
 Okay, and so you're saying that in this glabrous,

34:26.520 --> 34:28.300
 or beneath the glabrous skin.

34:29.240 --> 34:30.880
 There are these shunts.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.880
 And those go directly from arteries to veins.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.440
 So you skip the capillaries.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.280
 Yeah, I see.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.440
 And is it actually, as long as I say that in the skin,

34:41.440 --> 34:43.900
 you know, when I feel the pads in my hands,

34:45.680 --> 34:49.160
 how deep to the surface do these vessels reside?

34:49.160 --> 34:54.160
 They're below the, obviously, the epidermis.

34:54.160 --> 34:59.160
 So if you are warm and you look at the palms of your hands,

35:00.120 --> 35:02.320
 they are fairly red.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.340
 The backs of your hands aren't.

35:04.340 --> 35:06.760
 You don't have these vessels in the backs of your hands.

35:06.760 --> 35:11.760
 Now, if you take a glass, like a water tumbler, right,

35:12.000 --> 35:16.680
 and you grab it, you can see if you squeeze a little bit,

35:16.680 --> 35:18.960
 the hand goes white.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.520
 That's because you've shut off that blood flow.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.400
 Oh, interesting.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.800
 I'm going to do that little home experiment.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.240
 So if you're bicycling on a hot day,

35:26.240 --> 35:28.860
 you don't want to be grabbing your handlebars all the time.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.760
 You want to periodically.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.600
 Well, this is important.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.320
 I know you're privy to some really amazing results

35:35.320 --> 35:36.140
 that we're going to talk about,

35:36.140 --> 35:38.760
 but I actually heard you say this during this lecture

35:38.760 --> 35:41.680
 recently that Stanford held about human performance

35:41.680 --> 35:43.280
 that we're both part of.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.420
 And you mentioned this, that if you're cycling

35:46.420 --> 35:48.580
 and you're working hard and you want to be able

35:48.580 --> 35:52.480
 to do more work, we now know why you want to remain cool

35:52.480 --> 35:54.680
 in order to continue to do work.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.760
 And if you get too warm, that's bad.

35:56.760 --> 35:59.200
 That gripping the handlebars too tightly

35:59.200 --> 36:01.360
 will actually limit your performance.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.240
 And that's probably also true on the Peloton

36:03.240 --> 36:04.320
 or any other kind of device,

36:04.320 --> 36:06.860
 or the skier or anything like that.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.480
 So loosen the grip, or if you safely can,

36:09.480 --> 36:12.440
 you want to actually expose your hands to the world.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.240
 Now, what about for people wearing gloves?

36:14.240 --> 36:16.960
 What about the, to me, that just seems crazy

36:16.960 --> 36:18.580
 based on everything you're telling me?

36:18.580 --> 36:23.400
 Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss from the hands,

36:23.400 --> 36:27.000
 just as socks impede heat loss from the feet, okay?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.480
 So if you want to maximize your heat loss,

36:29.480 --> 36:31.760
 you want to have as thin a protectors

36:31.760 --> 36:33.760
 as possible on your hands.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.440
 And of course the feet are more problematical

36:36.440 --> 36:38.840
 because you have to be using them in certain ways.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.600
 Some people run barefoot.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.440
 Well, yeah.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.720
 That's become somewhat popular.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.000
 It seems like it kind of came and went.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.800
 They had those toe shoes things,

36:46.800 --> 36:49.140
 but they looked so ridiculous that I think most people

36:49.140 --> 36:51.760
 just were willing to take the performance hindrance

36:51.760 --> 36:52.720
 of regular shoes.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.840
 Actually, we had a track coach here at Stanford

36:54.840 --> 36:59.340
 who for a while was famous for introducing training

36:59.340 --> 37:00.760
 without shoes running.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.600
 Interesting.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.720
 And he thought it was because it changed the posture

37:03.720 --> 37:04.860
 of the runner.

37:04.860 --> 37:06.800
 And I think it was just due to the fact

37:06.800 --> 37:09.160
 that he was increasing the capacity

37:09.160 --> 37:10.560
 of his runners to lose heat.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
 Interesting.

37:11.560 --> 37:15.000
 Yeah, so heating up at the level of the hands

37:15.000 --> 37:16.360
 obviously is going to hinder performance.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.820
 So if I can, how about with running?

37:18.820 --> 37:22.020
 I noticed I ran across the country briefly in high school

37:22.020 --> 37:24.040
 and not particularly well at that,

37:24.040 --> 37:27.280
 but that we were told to run as if we were holding crackers

37:27.280 --> 37:29.920
 in our fingers or something, like very lightly,

37:29.920 --> 37:30.960
 and to keep hands kind of loose.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.600
 So running like this would actually be more beneficial

37:33.600 --> 37:36.600
 performance than, or gripping a phone,

37:36.600 --> 37:39.040
 which is probably what most people are doing nowadays.

37:39.040 --> 37:39.880
 Right?

37:39.880 --> 37:40.720
 Interesting.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.960
 And I once, I'll tell you an experience I had once.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.080
 I was in Alaska in the winter

37:46.080 --> 37:47.560
 and I went out running

37:47.560 --> 37:51.360
 and I absentmindedly forgot gloves.

37:51.360 --> 37:54.520
 And I realized this after a short period running

37:54.520 --> 37:58.740
 because the backs of my hands were aching from the cold.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.320
 The palms of my hands were sweating and were hot.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.520
 Oh, amazing.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.360
 Amazing.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.740
 So these compartments are a real thing.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.880
 And you mentioned the upper half of the face.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.320
 That's where our primate ancestors don't have fur.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.600
 And the bottoms of our feet.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.900
 So let's just take a moment and talk about

38:14.900 --> 38:17.800
 some of the more amazing results

38:17.800 --> 38:20.000
 that have been associated with proper cooling

38:20.000 --> 38:23.600
 of these glabrous skin surfaces.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.100
 Let me introduce one more thing.

38:25.100 --> 38:25.940
 Sure.

38:25.940 --> 38:27.240
 Because you asked earlier

38:27.240 --> 38:31.120
 about the pouring of water on the head.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.400
 One of the things which is not appreciated fully

38:34.400 --> 38:38.920
 is that the blood which is perfusing

38:38.920 --> 38:42.700
 these special blood vessels in the face above the beard line,

38:42.700 --> 38:45.200
 that's the non-hairy skin.

38:45.200 --> 38:50.200
 That blood then returns in the venous supply to the heart

38:50.360 --> 38:54.200
 but it actually does it in a very strange way.

38:54.200 --> 38:57.920
 It actually goes through what are called,

38:57.920 --> 38:59.240
 I'm blocking on the name now.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.200
 Take your time.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.500
 These are blood vessels that go through the skull, okay?

39:03.500 --> 39:05.760
 And that's why the scalp bleeds a lot

39:05.760 --> 39:07.560
 if you cut the scalp.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.760
 And these blood vessels which are called,

39:09.760 --> 39:11.880
 I want to say emergent but it's not emergent,

39:11.880 --> 39:14.440
 it's a word that means leaving.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.560
 And these blood vessels were primarily thought

39:17.560 --> 39:21.280
 to be ways that blood is leaving the brain.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.740
 But when you're overheated,

39:23.600 --> 39:28.200
 the direction of flow in those blood vessels reverses.

39:28.200 --> 39:33.200
 So the cooled blood that's coming from your facial region

39:33.300 --> 39:35.160
 goes into that circulation

39:35.160 --> 39:38.280
 and actually is a cooling source for the brain.

39:38.280 --> 39:41.080
 So you can cool the brain,

39:41.080 --> 39:42.880
 you can have a cooling effect on the brain

39:42.880 --> 39:45.920
 by pouring water on your head.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.360
 Interesting, so that practice which we,

39:48.360 --> 39:50.520
 at least for me, I most commonly associate

39:50.520 --> 39:53.080
 with combat sports where someone,

39:53.080 --> 39:54.500
 the fighter goes to their corner,

39:54.500 --> 39:56.920
 they usually sit down on a stool

39:56.920 --> 40:01.280
 unless they're trying to do some mental warfare

40:01.280 --> 40:04.300
 from the corner in which case they don't even take a seat.

40:04.300 --> 40:09.300
 And their corner crew will squeeze a glove,

40:09.300 --> 40:12.520
 excuse me, a sponge full of cold water over them.

40:14.180 --> 40:16.420
 That you're saying is somewhat effective

40:16.420 --> 40:17.540
 in cooling the brain.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.740
 Yeah, it's one of the natural mechanisms

40:19.740 --> 40:21.380
 for cooling the brain.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.680
 I want to return to this at some point as well,

40:23.680 --> 40:27.500
 but is there any known benefit to cooling the brain

40:27.500 --> 40:30.020
 in terms of offsetting physical damage,

40:30.020 --> 40:32.460
 offsetting the negative effects of concussion?

40:32.460 --> 40:35.620
 Because one of the reasons why fighters

40:35.620 --> 40:38.460
 will often get a cold on the back,

40:38.460 --> 40:41.020
 cold item on the back of the neck or on the head

40:41.020 --> 40:43.120
 is not just to cool them down,

40:43.120 --> 40:46.240
 but the theory is that it might offset

40:46.240 --> 40:48.480
 some of the damage of neurons.

40:50.100 --> 40:51.760
 I just can't comment on that.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.820
 I'm aware of those ideas, but they're controversial.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.740
 One of the things that you want to do

40:57.740 --> 41:01.900
 for injury to the brain is to decrease swelling.

41:01.900 --> 41:05.200
 And one of the ways that you decrease swelling

41:05.200 --> 41:08.780
 in many parts of the body is to cool.

41:10.140 --> 41:12.020
 It decreases inflammation.

41:12.020 --> 41:14.060
 It decreases the blood flow.

41:14.060 --> 41:18.560
 So I think it's a really interesting topic

41:18.560 --> 41:21.800
 and it's something that should be investigated.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.380
 It's kind of hard to investigate.

41:23.380 --> 41:26.260
 Yeah, interesting.

41:26.260 --> 41:31.260
 Okay, so I hear these stories and I've seen the data,

41:31.700 --> 41:33.520
 so I believe the stories.

41:33.520 --> 41:36.900
 Maybe tell us a story about an observation

41:36.900 --> 41:41.740
 that your group has made with respect to anaerobic exercise

41:41.740 --> 41:46.740
 and proper cooling of these glabrous surfaces.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.780
 And we can talk about the technology.

41:49.860 --> 41:52.420
 Maybe give us the dips example first.

41:52.420 --> 41:55.240
 Dips, of course, I think most people are familiar with dips.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.620
 You're supposed to, I guess, get down.

41:56.620 --> 41:57.660
 Raise and lower your body mass.

41:57.660 --> 42:00.140
 Yeah, raise and lower your body mass,

42:00.140 --> 42:01.540
 usually with your legs dangling down.

42:01.540 --> 42:04.180
 Sometimes people are strong enough to attach a weight there

42:04.180 --> 42:07.060
 and they'll do, it's essentially

42:07.060 --> 42:08.700
 a compound upper body exercise.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.580
 One dip would not be particularly impressive

42:12.580 --> 42:13.660
 for most people.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.300
 100 would be very impressive.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.220
 20 would be impressive for some, et cetera.

42:19.220 --> 42:23.060
 What happens when a skilled athlete comes in

42:23.060 --> 42:25.180
 and does dips for multiple sets?

42:25.180 --> 42:27.420
 And then what happens when they cool properly

42:27.420 --> 42:29.740
 using the glabrous skin surfaces?

42:29.740 --> 42:33.580
 This was a story that occurred early on

42:33.580 --> 42:37.060
 in our investigations when we first made the discoveries

42:37.060 --> 42:41.620
 that cooling has a benefit to increase your work volume,

42:41.620 --> 42:45.020
 your capacity to do more reps, okay?

42:45.020 --> 42:48.860
 So the word got over, I think, to the 49ers camp

42:49.800 --> 42:52.660
 and one of their players, Greg Clark,

42:52.660 --> 42:54.060
 who was a tight end at the time,

42:54.060 --> 42:56.280
 he had been tight end at Stanford,

42:56.280 --> 43:01.280
 and he decided, or I don't know if he was asked or what,

43:01.580 --> 43:03.980
 to come over and check it out.

43:03.980 --> 43:07.820
 So Greg came over and we said, Greg, what are you good at?

43:07.820 --> 43:09.860
 What activity do you like to do?

43:09.860 --> 43:10.860
 He said, dips.

43:10.860 --> 43:12.420
 I can do a lot of dips.

43:12.420 --> 43:15.260
 I can do 40 dips in a first set

43:15.260 --> 43:16.940
 and I can probably do five sets.

43:16.940 --> 43:19.140
 That's a usual workout for me.

43:19.140 --> 43:20.420
 And we said, okay.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.820
 So he came over to the gym one day

43:22.820 --> 43:24.460
 and that's exactly what he did.

43:24.460 --> 43:29.460
 He did 40 dips the first set and then maybe 25 and 15

43:30.660 --> 43:31.780
 and down from there.

43:31.780 --> 43:34.020
 Do you recall roughly what kind of rest periods

43:34.020 --> 43:35.020
 he was taking between sets?

43:35.020 --> 43:40.020
 Yeah, we standardized the rest period to three minutes

43:40.020 --> 43:43.880
 because that's what we had set on for cooling

43:43.880 --> 43:44.720
 as the intervals.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.980
 That's a good long rest period.

43:45.980 --> 43:46.820
 Yeah, it is.

43:46.820 --> 43:48.180
 It's still a lot of dips.

43:48.180 --> 43:50.180
 Yeah, it's actually a longer rest period

43:50.180 --> 43:54.060
 than many people would prefer during workouts.

43:54.060 --> 43:54.900
 They want to make the most of their time.

43:54.900 --> 43:58.740
 Not me, I prefer to take as much rest as I possibly can.

43:58.740 --> 44:00.580
 So several days later, he came back

44:00.580 --> 44:04.860
 and his first set he did, I think maybe 42.

44:04.860 --> 44:06.060
 A little bit better,

44:06.060 --> 44:07.980
 but now people were standing around watching.

44:07.980 --> 44:10.980
 So there was a little impetus there to show off.

44:12.340 --> 44:15.820
 So then his second set was, I don't remember the numbers,

44:15.820 --> 44:19.700
 but very much above the second set on the control day.

44:19.700 --> 44:21.700
 This was after we cooled his-

44:21.700 --> 44:22.780
 Okay, so he does.

44:22.780 --> 44:24.500
 When is he doing the cooling?

44:24.500 --> 44:27.300
 He's sitting down and putting his hands

44:27.300 --> 44:28.860
 in the devices that we had built,

44:28.860 --> 44:31.760
 which were cooling the palms of his hands.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.420
 For how long does that cooling take?

44:33.420 --> 44:35.420
 Can he do it inside of a three-minute rest period?

44:35.420 --> 44:36.660
 Yeah, that's what we were doing.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.940
 We standardized the interval

44:38.940 --> 44:42.220
 for resting or cooling to three minutes.

44:42.220 --> 44:45.820
 Okay, but the point is he got to his fifth set

44:45.820 --> 44:48.140
 and all of the sets were above

44:48.140 --> 44:50.560
 what he had done on the previous day.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.300
 And he said, you know, I'm not tired.

44:52.300 --> 44:53.900
 I can do another set.

44:53.900 --> 44:56.340
 And then I can do another set.

44:56.340 --> 44:57.780
 I can do another set.

44:57.780 --> 44:58.620
 I can do another set.

44:58.620 --> 45:03.480
 So from one day to two or three days later with cooling,

45:03.480 --> 45:06.460
 he doubled the total work volume.

45:06.460 --> 45:08.700
 He doubled the total number of dips.

45:08.700 --> 45:12.140
 By adding more sets and more repetitions to each set.

45:12.140 --> 45:13.200
 Right.

45:13.200 --> 45:17.740
 So then he kept coming back for four more weeks,

45:17.740 --> 45:18.900
 twice a week.

45:18.900 --> 45:21.980
 And by the end of that month,

45:21.980 --> 45:24.820
 he was doing 300 dips.

45:24.820 --> 45:25.660
 Wow, so what percentage?

45:25.660 --> 45:26.500
 So he tripled.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.260
 He essentially tripled.

45:28.260 --> 45:30.420
 And so here's a professional athlete

45:30.420 --> 45:32.260
 at peak physical conditioning

45:32.260 --> 45:34.820
 and he triples what he can do.

45:34.820 --> 45:35.820
 Amazing.

45:35.820 --> 45:38.060
 And in terms of his ability to recover,

45:39.060 --> 45:42.060
 was that explored or discussed at all?

45:42.060 --> 45:43.940
 Because my understanding is that

45:43.940 --> 45:47.740
 if we cause enough stress to a muscle

45:47.740 --> 45:49.640
 during anaerobic training,

45:49.640 --> 45:54.100
 we provide the stimulus for compensatory regrowth, et cetera.

45:54.100 --> 45:56.820
 But if we do more work,

45:56.820 --> 45:59.740
 we essentially scale up the amount of recovery that's needed

45:59.740 --> 46:00.700
 or the recovery time.

46:00.700 --> 46:02.260
 I'm very curious about whether or not

46:02.260 --> 46:03.600
 he needed longer to recover

46:03.600 --> 46:05.940
 between these super performing workouts.

46:05.940 --> 46:07.500
 That's very interesting.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.740
 That was a major discovery,

46:09.740 --> 46:13.460
 which we didn't realize we were making at the time.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.540
 There is this phenomenon you're referring to

46:15.540 --> 46:19.020
 as delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS.

46:19.020 --> 46:21.700
 And this is due to those little micro tears

46:21.700 --> 46:23.700
 and so forth that are happening

46:23.700 --> 46:28.700
 as we extend our workout capacity, volume.

46:29.980 --> 46:32.940
 So we've had this experience so many times

46:32.940 --> 46:36.740
 that an athlete or anyone will come in to the lab

46:36.740 --> 46:40.220
 and they will exceed what their previous goals were,

46:40.220 --> 46:42.140
 their previous expectations.

46:42.140 --> 46:44.900
 And I can always see the words coming out of their mouth.

46:44.900 --> 46:47.660
 I'm going to be so sore tomorrow.

46:47.660 --> 46:49.280
 They never are.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.120
 Interesting.

46:50.120 --> 46:53.360
 And we've actually demonstrated that with a naive group.

46:53.360 --> 46:58.120
 We had a class, a physical conditioning class,

46:58.120 --> 47:01.620
 and we had half of them.

47:01.620 --> 47:02.980
 The first days of the class,

47:02.980 --> 47:05.580
 we had to establish their true capacity,

47:05.580 --> 47:07.180
 what they could do.

47:07.180 --> 47:11.260
 So these were pretty heavy workouts for these new recruits.

47:11.260 --> 47:14.700
 And we gave half of them the benefit of cooling

47:14.700 --> 47:16.140
 and the other half not.

47:16.140 --> 47:19.300
 And then we had them record their subjective levels

47:19.300 --> 47:21.180
 of delayed onset muscle soreness.

47:21.180 --> 47:23.440
 And those that were cooled

47:23.440 --> 47:25.900
 didn't have significant muscle soreness.

47:25.900 --> 47:26.740
 Amazing.

47:26.740 --> 47:28.340
 And I know there are also published results

47:28.340 --> 47:30.740
 and we will provide links to some of these papers

47:30.740 --> 47:33.980
 for people seeing similar effects,

47:33.980 --> 47:36.780
 I should say similar performance enhancing effects

47:36.780 --> 47:41.100
 using bench presses, bench press or pushups

47:41.100 --> 47:42.700
 or other sorts of things.

47:42.700 --> 47:44.360
 Maybe you could give us an example

47:44.360 --> 47:48.860
 from the realm of endurance work or aerobic work,

47:48.860 --> 47:51.680
 running, cycling, things of that sort.

47:51.680 --> 47:55.340
 Well, one of the problems for us

47:55.340 --> 47:59.740
 is that our equipment now is not really portable.

47:59.740 --> 48:01.020
 I mean, it's portable in the sense

48:01.020 --> 48:03.980
 you can carry it to the gym or to the football field.

48:03.980 --> 48:04.820
 But you're not going to run with it.

48:04.820 --> 48:06.580
 But you're not going to run with it, right.

48:06.580 --> 48:07.780
 Or equip a bicycle with it.

48:07.780 --> 48:10.420
 Although when are the cooling handles on bicycles coming?

48:10.420 --> 48:11.840
 Yeah, that would be good.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.740
 But one itinerant activity is golfing

48:15.740 --> 48:17.740
 and people have put it on their golf carts

48:17.740 --> 48:18.580
 and they're out.

48:18.580 --> 48:20.900
 Do people really heat up that much in golf?

48:20.900 --> 48:21.740
 They do.

48:21.740 --> 48:23.100
 Not to be disparaging of the golfers,

48:23.100 --> 48:25.260
 but the way I conceptualize golf,

48:25.260 --> 48:26.740
 it's like a swing and then a walk

48:26.740 --> 48:29.500
 and then a cart ride and then a meal.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.740
 I probably just offended all the golfers out there.

48:31.740 --> 48:35.300
 Well, one time we were doing work

48:35.300 --> 48:38.980
 for the Department of Defense

48:38.980 --> 48:40.580
 and they wanted to check it out

48:40.580 --> 48:43.740
 whether or not what we were doing was really worthwhile.

48:43.740 --> 48:48.740
 So they sent out a team of special ops soldiers

48:48.860 --> 48:51.500
 to be our subjects and test it out.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.220
 They were here for a week.

48:53.220 --> 48:56.060
 So that was a fun week.

48:56.060 --> 48:57.880
 Yeah, I do some work with those guys.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.100
 They're hard driving guys.

49:00.100 --> 49:01.420
 They also know how to have fun.

49:01.420 --> 49:04.900
 But yeah, they definitely have,

49:04.900 --> 49:07.700
 if they have an off or a quit switch,

49:07.700 --> 49:11.400
 it's buried deep within their nervous system.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.640
 They don't like to hit that quit switch.

49:13.640 --> 49:16.260
 So the guy who wrote the final report,

49:16.260 --> 49:19.360
 he gave an addendum to the report and he said,

49:19.360 --> 49:22.700
 well, I'll tell you this, after I've gotten home,

49:22.700 --> 49:24.260
 it's added that technology.

49:24.260 --> 49:25.660
 They took the technology with them.

49:25.660 --> 49:26.500
 They wanted to keep it.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.020
 Oh yeah, that sounds about right.

49:28.020 --> 49:30.180
 I said, and using it,

49:30.180 --> 49:33.160
 it has added 20 yards to every club in my bag

49:33.160 --> 49:35.920
 and that's no effing small deal.

49:35.920 --> 49:38.180
 So it's allowing people to hit further,

49:38.180 --> 49:40.300
 hit the golf ball further.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.140
 Interesting.

49:42.740 --> 49:46.640
 All right, so for the golf players out there,

49:48.340 --> 49:52.440
 then that's the reward you get back from Craig

49:52.440 --> 49:54.040
 for all my little knocks on golf.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.080
 I actually, I don't have any knock on golf.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.280
 I just don't think about it as a sport

49:58.280 --> 50:00.980
 where heating up is a limiting factor.

50:00.980 --> 50:04.540
 So since they're getting more out of their drive,

50:04.540 --> 50:06.300
 what do you think is going on there?

50:06.300 --> 50:08.480
 Well, they can be heating up.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.320
 And they're wearing gloves, right?

50:09.320 --> 50:11.900
 They're wearing gloves on a hot day and so forth.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.660
 But let me just tell you one more serious story

50:14.660 --> 50:19.400
 about golfers and that is individuals with multiple sclerosis

50:19.400 --> 50:21.700
 are exceedingly temperature sensitive.

50:21.700 --> 50:22.540
 I didn't know that.

50:22.540 --> 50:24.780
 So they may still be mobile,

50:24.780 --> 50:27.020
 but they have to stay in cool locations

50:27.020 --> 50:31.220
 and not increase their exercise to any great extent.

50:31.220 --> 50:35.420
 But we've had subjects that have with multiple sclerosis

50:35.420 --> 50:38.340
 who have just essentially put the device on their golf cart

50:38.340 --> 50:39.540
 and they're back out playing golf

50:39.540 --> 50:40.540
 in the middle of the summer.

50:40.540 --> 50:41.660
 Oh, that's great.

50:41.660 --> 50:42.900
 That's great.

50:42.900 --> 50:45.780
 Anything that allows people to have normal levels

50:45.780 --> 50:50.640
 of livelihood and recreation is great.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.460
 We always think about performance

50:52.460 --> 50:54.460
 at these kind of like peak and elite levels

50:54.460 --> 50:56.260
 and pushing harder.

50:56.260 --> 50:57.660
 But yeah, anything that allows people

50:57.660 --> 51:00.440
 to be mobile and functional is great.

51:00.440 --> 51:04.860
 So what's your favorite example of endurance?

51:04.860 --> 51:06.780
 And feel free to give us the extreme one

51:06.780 --> 51:09.660
 and then we'll talk about averages to be,

51:09.660 --> 51:12.860
 make sure we're thorough about averages versus exceptions.

51:12.860 --> 51:13.700
 Right.

51:13.700 --> 51:16.740
 We haven't done a lot in the field.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.660
 I mean, outdoors.

51:18.660 --> 51:22.300
 Most of our endurance has been in a hot room

51:22.300 --> 51:24.060
 with treadmill work and so forth.

51:24.060 --> 51:26.380
 So the very first experiment we had,

51:26.380 --> 51:29.300
 I think maybe 18 subjects just off the street.

51:29.300 --> 51:32.100
 I mean, we just recruited people in the hallways,

51:32.100 --> 51:33.480
 come on in and do this.

51:33.480 --> 51:36.900
 And what we found is we could,

51:36.900 --> 51:39.900
 for this group with one trial with and without cooling,

51:39.900 --> 51:42.300
 we could double their endurance,

51:42.300 --> 51:43.600
 walking on the treadmill,

51:43.600 --> 51:45.960
 walking uphill on the treadmill in the heat,

51:45.960 --> 51:48.380
 like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature,

51:48.380 --> 51:49.540
 40 degrees centigrade.

51:49.540 --> 51:50.940
 So what does that experiment look like?

51:50.940 --> 51:54.080
 You're having people walk on an incline, it's really warm.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.300
 Some people are just going to hit the quit button

51:56.300 --> 51:58.700
 and say, I've had enough and get off the treadmill.

51:58.700 --> 51:59.540
 Right.

51:59.540 --> 52:00.540
 With proper cooling.

52:00.540 --> 52:01.980
 When are they doing the cooling?

52:01.980 --> 52:04.220
 They're doing it continuously.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.060
 I see.

52:05.060 --> 52:06.540
 Because in the laboratory,

52:06.540 --> 52:10.460
 we can suspend devices from the ceiling, for example.

52:10.460 --> 52:13.260
 Now we do have prototype wearable devices.

52:13.260 --> 52:18.260
 We did them in response to emails from Ebola workers

52:18.740 --> 52:21.940
 a number of years ago in Sierra Leone.

52:21.940 --> 52:24.120
 They said, we've read about your work with athletes.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.500
 Can't you do something for us?

52:25.500 --> 52:27.600
 I mean, we're in the personal protective gear

52:27.600 --> 52:28.940
 and we can't be in the hot zone

52:28.940 --> 52:31.500
 for more than 15 or 20 minutes.

52:31.500 --> 52:34.760
 So that was started us on the challenge

52:34.760 --> 52:39.180
 of developing wearable systems that could go under the PPE.

52:39.180 --> 52:40.780
 We've published that work now.

52:40.780 --> 52:41.620
 That's great.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.540
 And I'm guessing the military special operators

52:43.540 --> 52:45.460
 that are out in the desert and other locations

52:45.460 --> 52:47.940
 are probably excited about this technology.

52:47.940 --> 52:49.300
 Well, once they get it.

52:49.300 --> 52:50.140
 Once they get it.

52:50.140 --> 52:52.020
 It's coming, it's coming.

52:52.020 --> 52:55.620
 Yeah, I think some people might wonder

52:55.620 --> 52:56.740
 if there are all these studies

52:56.740 --> 52:59.180
 and there are these incredible results over the years,

52:59.180 --> 53:00.660
 why haven't we heard more about it?

53:00.660 --> 53:02.920
 And I will ask your opinion on that as well,

53:02.920 --> 53:04.860
 but I'll just editorialize a little bit.

53:04.860 --> 53:09.460
 Is that the best laboratory work

53:09.460 --> 53:11.060
 and its practical applications

53:11.060 --> 53:13.880
 oftentimes requires many studies.

53:14.860 --> 53:19.420
 And oftentimes there isn't a portal, so to speak,

53:19.420 --> 53:22.140
 to get that information out into the technology sector.

53:22.140 --> 53:25.740
 So there is a company that's developing this technology

53:25.740 --> 53:30.260
 for people to use, to purchase and use.

53:30.260 --> 53:31.420
 We might as well just tell us now,

53:31.420 --> 53:32.980
 what is the name of that company?

53:32.980 --> 53:34.820
 And do they have a website?

53:34.820 --> 53:36.540
 People are going to want to know

53:36.540 --> 53:39.140
 where can they get this magical technology?

53:39.140 --> 53:42.000
 And is there a poor man's version of it as well?

53:42.000 --> 53:46.220
 Well, the company is Arturia, A-R-T-E-R-I-A.

53:46.220 --> 53:51.220
 And the website is www.coolmit.com.

53:51.220 --> 53:56.220
 So coolmit is just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T, coolmit.com.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.260
 It's a great website.

53:58.260 --> 54:00.120
 When I went there, it says that right now

54:00.120 --> 54:01.660
 the technology is only available

54:01.660 --> 54:04.020
 to professional sports teams and military.

54:04.020 --> 54:04.860
 Is that true?

54:04.860 --> 54:07.660
 Well, where we stand now is the new version

54:07.660 --> 54:10.620
 of the technology is sort of in beta test versions.

54:10.620 --> 54:12.520
 We got it into the hands of people

54:12.520 --> 54:14.520
 who had used the technology before.

54:14.520 --> 54:17.980
 So there's NFL teams that are using,

54:17.980 --> 54:22.020
 there's college teams, there's Olympics,

54:22.020 --> 54:26.360
 there's the Navy Seals, Major League Baseball,

54:26.360 --> 54:29.460
 the NBA, the National Tennis Association.

54:29.460 --> 54:33.860
 They have locations where now they are trying this out

54:33.860 --> 54:35.540
 and reporting back, how's it working?

54:35.540 --> 54:36.520
 How could you change it?

54:36.520 --> 54:37.580
 How could you improve it?

54:37.580 --> 54:38.400
 Great.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.240
 And so forth.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.620
 So that's where we are.

54:40.620 --> 54:44.420
 But on the website, you can actually sign up

54:44.420 --> 54:48.020
 for being one who will be able to get one

54:48.020 --> 54:50.500
 when they are finally manufactured.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.920
 They're now being made in fairly small lots

54:52.920 --> 54:54.620
 because you want to change things

54:54.620 --> 54:57.020
 as you realize how it can be improved.

54:57.020 --> 54:58.420
 Yeah, this is Stanford after all.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.420
 You want to get the technology right.

55:00.420 --> 55:02.800
 I like to joke that one of the reasons

55:02.800 --> 55:04.540
 I like being at Stanford so much is that

55:04.540 --> 55:06.260
 not only are my colleagues amazing

55:06.260 --> 55:07.660
 and they're so forward thinking,

55:07.660 --> 55:09.300
 but they're all perfectionists.

55:09.300 --> 55:12.860
 And so the perfectionist mindset has to be perfect

55:12.860 --> 55:15.920
 before it can go live, so to speak.

55:15.920 --> 55:18.400
 Well, I think there will be a lot of interest.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.660
 Let's talk about the technology

55:20.660 --> 55:22.180
 in a little more detail for a moment.

55:22.180 --> 55:24.460
 And then let's talk about whether or not

55:24.460 --> 55:26.500
 cruder forms of that technology exist,

55:26.500 --> 55:29.140
 either for sake of safety and or performance.

55:30.140 --> 55:33.800
 So what is, the cool mitt, as I understand,

55:33.800 --> 55:35.660
 is it's a mitt, it's a glove.

55:35.660 --> 55:39.360
 You put your hand into, you hold on to a surface

55:39.360 --> 55:42.300
 and that surface cools your hand

55:42.300 --> 55:46.140
 and thereby through this specialized portal,

55:46.140 --> 55:47.800
 cools your core body temperature

55:47.800 --> 55:50.060
 and all the muscles of the body.

55:50.060 --> 55:53.200
 Subjectively, if I were to do this right now,

55:53.200 --> 55:55.260
 would I think that it was ice cold

55:55.260 --> 55:58.260
 or would I think it was just cool?

55:58.260 --> 55:59.140
 Just cool.

55:59.140 --> 55:59.980
 I see.

55:59.980 --> 56:01.580
 Ice cold is too cold.

56:01.580 --> 56:02.940
 So people always ask,

56:02.940 --> 56:04.420
 well, why can't you just stick your hand

56:04.420 --> 56:05.800
 in a bucket of ice water?

56:05.800 --> 56:07.100
 It's too cold.

56:07.100 --> 56:09.500
 What that does is that causes reflex

56:09.500 --> 56:12.740
 vasoconstriction of the very portals

56:12.740 --> 56:16.580
 that you're trying to maximize the heat loss from.

56:16.580 --> 56:18.840
 So you stick your hand in cold water

56:18.840 --> 56:20.300
 and when it comes out, it's cold.

56:20.300 --> 56:22.260
 You just sealed up all the heat in your body.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.980
 Yeah, right.

56:23.980 --> 56:27.820
 So what I sort of recommended to someone at one point,

56:27.820 --> 56:29.300
 they said, well, when I'm running,

56:29.300 --> 56:31.920
 can I just carry a frozen juice can

56:31.920 --> 56:33.380
 and it will gradually melt?

56:33.380 --> 56:36.340
 And I said, well, no, because that's going to decrease

56:36.340 --> 56:37.700
 the heat loss from that hand.

56:37.700 --> 56:41.060
 But if every couple of minutes you switched hands,

56:41.060 --> 56:41.900
 it might work.

56:41.900 --> 56:44.700
 Well, I have a feeling that there are people now doing that

56:44.700 --> 56:46.740
 as well as trying this.

56:46.740 --> 56:51.560
 So how long in the cool mitt at the proper temperature,

56:51.560 --> 56:55.420
 how long are people putting their hands into the mitt?

56:55.420 --> 56:59.300
 We, once again, had just standardized on three minutes.

56:59.300 --> 57:03.540
 And part of the reason for that is that the rate of heat

57:03.540 --> 57:07.580
 loss is an exponentially declining curve, okay?

57:07.580 --> 57:11.600
 And three minutes sort of gets the best part of the curve.

57:11.600 --> 57:14.240
 So you can go longer and get more benefit,

57:14.240 --> 57:15.840
 but the biggest bang for the buck

57:15.840 --> 57:18.420
 is in the first two, three minutes.

57:18.420 --> 57:19.260
 Okay.

57:19.260 --> 57:22.140
 You mentioned a number of impressive organizations,

57:22.140 --> 57:24.540
 sports teams, and military that are using this.

57:24.540 --> 57:26.320
 This is not something that I typically see

57:26.320 --> 57:29.460
 on the sidelines of games, although to be honest,

57:29.460 --> 57:31.700
 I haven't looked very carefully.

57:31.700 --> 57:35.080
 I'm guessing that they are probably keeping the technology

57:35.080 --> 57:36.700
 somewhat under wraps.

57:36.700 --> 57:38.580
 Where and how are they doing this?

57:38.580 --> 57:40.180
 Are they running back to the locker room?

57:40.180 --> 57:41.740
 I mean, the military special operators

57:41.740 --> 57:44.360
 are doing their thing, but in terms of the athletes,

57:44.360 --> 57:46.420
 is it possible, hypothetically,

57:46.420 --> 57:51.020
 the athletes are doing this somewhat incognito?

57:51.020 --> 57:53.860
 It's possible, but I really don't know.

57:53.860 --> 57:56.380
 People have mentioned here at Stanford,

57:56.380 --> 57:59.020
 they don't see the football team using it.

57:59.020 --> 58:00.980
 Well, the football team here at Stanford

58:00.980 --> 58:04.740
 is mostly playing in cold weather, cool weather.

58:04.740 --> 58:06.380
 The night games are cool.

58:06.380 --> 58:09.400
 Even date games are not very hot frequently here,

58:09.400 --> 58:13.580
 but when they go to a hot place like Arizona or Utah,

58:13.580 --> 58:17.880
 at least our coach, Shaw, says that they take it with them,

58:17.880 --> 58:20.180
 and that's when they find the benefit.

58:20.180 --> 58:21.220
 That's when they use it.

58:21.220 --> 58:22.740
 Interesting.

58:22.740 --> 58:27.740
 So is there a poor man or woman's version of this?

58:29.760 --> 58:31.680
 You mentioned the juice can passing back and forth.

58:31.680 --> 58:33.280
 You mentioned cooling the hands.

58:33.280 --> 58:36.740
 A number of people said to me

58:36.740 --> 58:38.580
 after learning a little bit about this science

58:38.580 --> 58:43.260
 and technology that they've experienced some big effects,

58:43.260 --> 58:46.380
 positive effects of cooling by,

58:46.380 --> 58:47.420
 and I confess I've done this,

58:47.420 --> 58:50.380
 taking a package of frozen blueberries

58:50.380 --> 58:52.260
 and just kind of passing it back and forth between my hands.

58:52.260 --> 58:53.440
 Now, talking to you,

58:53.440 --> 58:55.700
 I realize I probably didn't do it long enough.

58:55.700 --> 58:58.840
 I probably was, I was only doing maybe 30 seconds,

58:58.840 --> 59:00.660
 passing it back and forth between my hands

59:00.660 --> 59:02.420
 and then going back into sets.

59:02.420 --> 59:06.320
 I did see a performance enhancing effect, absolutely,

59:06.320 --> 59:10.900
 but I realized I probably wasn't optimizing the protocol.

59:10.900 --> 59:14.540
 If you were going to give a crude protocol for,

59:14.540 --> 59:15.700
 let's just say for the gym,

59:15.700 --> 59:17.520
 because with running, it's a little bit tricky,

59:17.520 --> 59:19.660
 but what would that look like

59:19.660 --> 59:21.500
 if people wanted to just play with this

59:21.500 --> 59:23.900
 in some sort of fashion?

59:23.900 --> 59:28.780
 Well, it would be experimental.

59:28.780 --> 59:31.340
 Sure, yeah, none of that is very controlled.

59:31.340 --> 59:34.500
 Your idea of frozen peas is a good idea.

59:34.500 --> 59:38.220
 And I think since there's been no actual study of that,

59:38.220 --> 59:40.820
 you would have to be you working out

59:40.820 --> 59:42.860
 what is the best for you.

59:42.860 --> 59:45.220
 But one way to figure it out is that

59:45.220 --> 59:50.220
 if after you hold the cold peas in one hand

59:50.380 --> 59:52.340
 and you switch it to the other hand,

59:52.340 --> 59:55.140
 if someone then comes and feels your hand,

59:55.140 --> 59:56.860
 is it warm or cold?

59:56.860 --> 59:59.940
 If it's cold, it means you've as a constricted.

59:59.940 --> 1:00:04.400
 If it's warm, it means the hot blood is still going there.

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:06.340
 Okay, so we do that in the lab.

1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:08.700
 And the key is for it to not vasoconstrict.

1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:09.540
 Right.

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:11.220
 Okay, so there's a test out there, folks.

1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:13.420
 If you're going to try this in kind of crude fashion,

1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:17.300
 at least until the cool mitt is available more broadly

1:00:18.460 --> 1:00:20.180
 to the general public,

1:00:20.180 --> 1:00:22.380
 you could assess, you want to assess

1:00:22.380 --> 1:00:25.420
 whether or not your palms actually feel cool

1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:27.660
 to the touch by somebody else.

1:00:27.660 --> 1:00:28.500
 And if it does,

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:30.380
 that means you've essentially shut down the port

1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:32.620
 or you're sealing in more heat, which is bad.

1:00:32.620 --> 1:00:37.620
 What about putting this cold pack of some sort on the face?

1:00:37.980 --> 1:00:39.320
 Or-

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:40.160
 Or the feet.

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:40.980
 More of the feet.

1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:41.820
 I work out at home.

1:00:41.820 --> 1:00:43.100
 I don't often work out barefooted,

1:00:43.100 --> 1:00:45.420
 but I suppose I could, like they did in the 70s,

1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:47.340
 you know, when those guys were walking around

1:00:47.340 --> 1:00:51.360
 without shoes and squatting without any shoes or socks on.

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:53.740
 Could I put my feet on them?

1:00:53.740 --> 1:00:54.620
 You could.

1:00:54.620 --> 1:00:59.060
 If you had simply had a water-perfused pad

1:00:59.060 --> 1:01:01.700
 and you were circulating cool water through it,

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:03.740
 you could just put your feet on it.

1:01:03.740 --> 1:01:04.580
 Okay?

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:12.340
 Part of the problem is that you don't want,

1:01:12.340 --> 1:01:16.660
 if, let's say you have just a cold pack of something.

1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:19.700
 The problem is back to boundary layers again.

1:01:19.700 --> 1:01:24.140
 If you don't have a convective stream of the cooling medium,

1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:25.960
 the heat sink is not as effective

1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:28.620
 because there'll be a boundary layer developed

1:01:28.620 --> 1:01:32.700
 between the heat sink material and your skin.

1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:35.340
 So that decreases its efficacy.

1:01:35.340 --> 1:01:36.180
 I see.

1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:39.160
 Maybe we should just for a moment talk about convection,

1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:41.380
 radiation and convection, and just make that clear.

1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:44.660
 Like if I put my hands, let's say it's a cold night

1:01:44.660 --> 1:01:46.660
 and I'm at a campfire and I take my hands

1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:47.980
 and I put them out to the fire.

1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:49.140
 You're getting radiation.

1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:50.420
 You're getting radiation.

1:01:50.420 --> 1:01:51.860
 Right, right.

1:01:51.860 --> 1:01:55.060
 And then if it's a windy, warm night,

1:01:55.060 --> 1:01:56.580
 no, I don't know if that's the best example.

1:01:56.580 --> 1:01:58.940
 Give us a good example of convection.

1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:01.420
 Convection sure is in a cool breeze.

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:04.580
 You know, the wind chill factor, that's due to convection.

1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:05.420
 Okay?

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:10.180
 But in terms of heat transfer between two objects,

1:02:10.180 --> 1:02:13.180
 if you have convection of the medium,

1:02:13.180 --> 1:02:17.780
 whether it's blood on the inside and water on the outside,

1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:22.260
 you increase the heat exchange if you have convection

1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:23.100
 on both sides.

1:02:23.100 --> 1:02:25.540
 Right, so this is why just planting my feet

1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:28.980
 on two packages of, my bare feet on two packages

1:02:28.980 --> 1:02:31.180
 of frozen peas, there's really no opportunity

1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:34.860
 for circulation and therefore heat transfer.

1:02:34.860 --> 1:02:38.140
 So it's not really optimal, which is, and I-

1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:40.460
 But once again, it depends on the surface area

1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:42.020
 to get any benefit at all.

1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:45.220
 We have a study that we published,

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:49.180
 which was investigating the standard treatment

1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:51.420
 for hyperthermia in the field.

1:02:51.420 --> 1:02:55.900
 And the standard treatment that's recommended

1:02:55.900 --> 1:03:00.060
 by medical organizations is you take cold packs

1:03:00.060 --> 1:03:03.180
 and you put them in the axilla, the groin.

1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:05.180
 The axilla or the armpits?

1:03:05.180 --> 1:03:08.100
 The armpits, yeah, the groin, which is-

1:03:09.900 --> 1:03:11.620
 Thin skin, lots of vasculature.

1:03:11.620 --> 1:03:14.420
 Right, and the neck.

1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:17.820
 So what we did is we did studies in which we made people

1:03:17.820 --> 1:03:20.420
 hyperthermic, and then we measured the rate

1:03:20.420 --> 1:03:24.420
 at which we could cool them by putting those positions

1:03:24.420 --> 1:03:29.100
 in those heat exchange bags in the recommended location

1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:33.580
 versus on the glabrous skin, versus palms, soles, and face.

1:03:33.580 --> 1:03:36.500
 The cooling rate was double.

1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:37.340
 Wow.

1:03:37.340 --> 1:03:42.020
 So we put the same ice packs, the same cold packs

1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:46.420
 on the heat portals rather than the axilla,

1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:47.900
 the groin, and the face.

1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:48.740
 Wow.

1:03:48.740 --> 1:03:49.820
 Or the neck.

1:03:49.820 --> 1:03:50.700
 Wow.

1:03:50.700 --> 1:03:53.280
 So face, hands, and bottoms of feet

1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.100
 will cool you twice as fast

1:03:56.340 --> 1:03:59.940
 as putting cold packs into your armpits,

1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:01.940
 your groin, or back of neck.

1:04:01.940 --> 1:04:05.900
 So I like to give the analogy of if your car is overheating,

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:09.040
 okay, and you have a hose, a garden hose,

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.060
 where should you spray your cooling system?

1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:15.640
 Should you spray the radiator or should you spray the tubes

1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:17.680
 going in and out of the radiator?

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:20.180
 Well, the rationale with putting these cold packs

1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:22.120
 in the axilla, the groin, and the neck

1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:25.420
 is that you're getting close to the major arteries.

1:04:25.420 --> 1:04:27.380
 Sure, that's going to be effective,

1:04:27.380 --> 1:04:30.620
 but it's much more effective if you actually increase

1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:33.580
 the heat loss capacity of the radiating surface,

1:04:33.580 --> 1:04:34.460
 the radiators.

1:04:34.460 --> 1:04:38.660
 So you cool the hot stuff heading toward the core.

1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:43.660
 That's essentially what the standard operating procedure is,

1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:46.580
 that you hit the arteries.

1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:47.400
 Amazing.

1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:48.900
 And the veins, the arteries and veins.

1:04:48.900 --> 1:04:50.420
 I'm going to just tell a brief story

1:04:50.420 --> 1:04:55.420
 that illustrates how almost everybody gets this stuff wrong,

1:04:56.120 --> 1:04:57.560
 and then I'm going to use that as an opportunity

1:04:57.560 --> 1:05:00.260
 to ask you about heating, deliberate heating,

1:05:00.260 --> 1:05:02.080
 as opposed to deliberate cooling.

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:06.460
 So about four months ago, a friend of mine, incidentally,

1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:08.900
 a guy who did nine years in the SEAL teams,

1:05:08.900 --> 1:05:10.820
 really skilled cold water swimmer.

1:05:10.820 --> 1:05:13.140
 We went out for a swim in the morning.

1:05:13.140 --> 1:05:17.400
 I'm not nearly even close to being in the same universe

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.740
 of his output potential.

1:05:19.740 --> 1:05:21.820
 We do these swims, I'm familiar with them.

1:05:21.820 --> 1:05:24.500
 I got enough blubber on me that I stay warm enough

1:05:24.500 --> 1:05:26.060
 in the cold Pacific, no wetsuits.

1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:28.980
 We do the morning cold swim for about a mile or so.

1:05:28.980 --> 1:05:32.900
 And we brought with us a young kid that I know real well

1:05:32.900 --> 1:05:35.380
 that hangs out with us sometimes and trains with us,

1:05:35.380 --> 1:05:37.740
 who's got very little body fat.

1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:39.980
 He's just exceptionally lean,

1:05:39.980 --> 1:05:42.500
 despite eating everything inside, right?

1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:47.500
 Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.

1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:49.100
 So we're out there swimming,

1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:51.460
 and at some point we're talking to him

1:05:51.460 --> 1:05:54.020
 and it's clear that he's gone hypothermic.

1:05:54.020 --> 1:05:56.980
 He's slurring his words, he's not doing well.

1:05:56.980 --> 1:05:59.820
 So we get him onto the beach, his teeth are turning yellow,

1:05:59.820 --> 1:06:03.260
 he's quaking, he's not, he's got, you know,

1:06:03.260 --> 1:06:06.220
 his saliva is taking on that consistency that's clear,

1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:07.900
 like he's hypothermic.

1:06:07.900 --> 1:06:10.140
 We go to the lifeguard station.

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:12.500
 Lifeguard says, okay, let's get his vitals,

1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:13.340
 let's do all this.

1:06:13.340 --> 1:06:17.340
 Meanwhile, trying stand next to him, you know,

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:19.660
 and heat him up by heating up his torso.

1:06:19.660 --> 1:06:23.980
 So there we are, like pressing against this guy, our friend,

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:24.940
 trying to heat him up.

1:06:24.940 --> 1:06:27.020
 They get a blanket on him.

1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:29.500
 He's, I'm realizing he was barefoot.

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:30.900
 His face was exposed,

1:06:30.900 --> 1:06:32.740
 although we did cover his head with the blanket.

1:06:32.740 --> 1:06:33.700
 And he eventually came back.

1:06:33.700 --> 1:06:36.660
 We got some warm liquids into him and he was okay.

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:37.700
 He was fine.

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:39.620
 I don't know that his mother is ever going to let him swim

1:06:39.620 --> 1:06:41.220
 with us again.

1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:43.760
 If I ever disappear and go missing,

1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:46.500
 it's because of that incident.

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:48.780
 Anyway, he did great.

1:06:48.780 --> 1:06:49.620
 He recovered.

1:06:49.620 --> 1:06:51.740
 He's back in the water and doing well.

1:06:51.740 --> 1:06:55.940
 But I realized that pretty much everything from the point

1:06:55.940 --> 1:06:59.860
 where we got back on the beach until he was back to normal

1:06:59.860 --> 1:07:01.380
 was we did incorrectly.

1:07:01.380 --> 1:07:03.200
 We heated his torso.

1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:06.700
 We left his extremities exposed.

1:07:06.700 --> 1:07:09.180
 And we assumed we were doing the right thing.

1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:11.060
 And the lifeguard is a skilled lifeguard

1:07:11.060 --> 1:07:13.260
 at a major public beach.

1:07:13.260 --> 1:07:15.460
 So I guess the simple question is,

1:07:15.460 --> 1:07:16.940
 did we get everything wrong?

1:07:16.940 --> 1:07:18.820
 Did we get anything right?

1:07:18.820 --> 1:07:21.040
 And what would have been the better option

1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:24.920
 to heat up a hypothermic person in that

1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:26.780
 or a similar situation?

1:07:26.780 --> 1:07:28.400
 Well, it's interesting you asked that

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:33.060
 because that is the way we got into this area

1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:34.340
 of investigation.

1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:39.180
 I worked on how the hypothalamus regulates body temperature

1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:40.940
 neurophysiology.

1:07:40.940 --> 1:07:45.640
 And one day we were having a discussion with a colleague

1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:48.020
 in the department of anesthesia.

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:51.640
 And he jokingly said to my colleague, he said,

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:54.560
 yeah, you guys think you know so much about temperature.

1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:56.700
 I bet you couldn't solve a problem we have

1:07:56.700 --> 1:07:58.660
 in the recovery room.

1:07:58.660 --> 1:07:59.860
 What's that?

1:07:59.860 --> 1:08:01.660
 Well, the patients come out of surgery,

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.880
 they're hypothermic and it takes us hours

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:06.340
 to get them to stop shivering.

1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:08.020
 What do they do in the recovery room?

1:08:08.020 --> 1:08:09.780
 Exactly what you suggested.

1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:11.340
 They put in warm blankets.

1:08:11.340 --> 1:08:13.820
 They put in heat lamps.

1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:16.880
 And it takes them an hour or two hours

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:18.940
 to get these patients to stop shivering

1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:20.580
 to bring them back up.

1:08:20.580 --> 1:08:22.740
 So we say, ah, it's a trivial problem.

1:08:22.740 --> 1:08:24.940
 No, it's a hard problem.

1:08:24.940 --> 1:08:28.380
 It's a hard problem because when you're under anesthesia,

1:08:28.380 --> 1:08:29.820
 you're vasodilated.

1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:31.580
 When you come out of anesthesia,

1:08:31.580 --> 1:08:34.420
 you're hypothermic and you vasoconstrict.

1:08:34.420 --> 1:08:38.220
 That makes it very difficult to get heat into the body.

1:08:38.220 --> 1:08:40.420
 So we got the idea that, well,

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:43.800
 if we could just take one appendage, like an arm,

1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:47.940
 and we put it in a environment wrapped in a heating pad

1:08:47.940 --> 1:08:51.260
 and a negative pressure, you know, suction,

1:08:51.260 --> 1:08:53.660
 that would pull more blood into that limb.

1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:55.020
 That blood would get heated

1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:57.360
 and it would warm the body up faster.

1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:01.980
 So my colleague built a prototype device.

1:09:01.980 --> 1:09:04.900
 You couldn't get such a device into the hospital these days.

1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:09.620
 But we were with our anesthesiologist friend.

1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:11.260
 We took it into the recovery room

1:09:11.260 --> 1:09:15.460
 and the first thing the patient said, no way.

1:09:15.460 --> 1:09:17.620
 You're not gonna put that on my patient.

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:22.620
 But he prevailed and first patient didn't shiver at all.

1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:25.340
 First patient was back to normal temperature,

1:09:25.340 --> 1:09:28.300
 core temperature in, I think it was eight minutes,

1:09:28.300 --> 1:09:29.260
 eight or nine minutes.

1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:31.540
 Is this now standard practice in hospitals?

1:09:31.540 --> 1:09:32.380
 No, no, no.

1:09:32.380 --> 1:09:35.380
 So this is another example where I don't get upset

1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:38.960
 about the, although it's upsetting to know that it's not,

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:41.460
 but I think that it's yet another case

1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:44.780
 where a fundamental problem exists.

1:09:44.780 --> 1:09:49.780
 There's a science-based solution

1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:52.300
 that makes sense at the level of physiology,

1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:55.900
 engineering and practice, and yet it's not being done.

1:09:55.900 --> 1:09:59.060
 And I mean, that's a whole other discussion

1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:00.680
 as to what the limitations are.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:03.300
 Well, perhaps in, I know a number of our listeners

1:10:03.300 --> 1:10:05.220
 are in the healthcare and medical profession

1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:06.380
 as well as military athletes,

1:10:06.380 --> 1:10:08.820
 and just also standard other types of jobs,

1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:11.400
 civilians doing other types of work.

1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:14.020
 It would be wonderful if people understood this.

1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:19.020
 So once again, is there a homegrown technology

1:10:19.180 --> 1:10:20.020
 that people could use?

1:10:20.020 --> 1:10:24.100
 If somebody is hypothermic, what is going to be the best way

1:10:24.100 --> 1:10:24.940
 for them to warm up?

1:10:24.940 --> 1:10:28.000
 Is it going to be holding a nice warm mug of cocoa

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:28.840
 or something like that?

1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:31.900
 But not too hot, I guess, is again the idea.

1:10:31.900 --> 1:10:36.900
 Yeah, well, actually you can go hotter on the glabrous skin.

1:10:37.860 --> 1:10:39.180
 Oh, because it'll dilate.

1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:42.500
 Because it takes the heat away faster, okay?

1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:44.260
 But back to the anesthesia,

1:10:44.260 --> 1:10:47.700
 what you can do is you can use warm pads.

1:10:47.700 --> 1:10:49.800
 They have them in all hospitals.

1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:52.780
 They have circulating water perfused pads.

1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:53.600
 Hot water bottle type stuff.

1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:54.660
 Put them on the feet.

1:10:54.660 --> 1:10:57.300
 So typically they'll slide them under your lower back

1:10:57.300 --> 1:10:58.140
 or something like that?

1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:00.180
 Yeah, put them on the feet.

1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:02.620
 Okay, sure, that will do it.

1:11:02.620 --> 1:11:07.360
 But it turns out that we discovered through this work

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:09.600
 that it had nothing to do with the whole arm.

1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:11.400
 It was only the hand.

1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:13.540
 And that's when we came to the realization

1:11:13.540 --> 1:11:15.400
 of these special blood vessels.

1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:17.160
 We didn't discover the blood vessels.

1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:19.180
 They're described in Grey's Anatomy,

1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:21.140
 but nobody knew what they were for.

1:11:21.140 --> 1:11:24.880
 And you mentioned bears earlier and other hairy animals.

1:11:26.580 --> 1:11:29.380
 Do they have these AVAs as well?

1:11:29.380 --> 1:11:31.020
 And I suppose we haven't defined AVAs.

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:32.880
 We've been pretty good about the no acronyms rule.

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:35.900
 AVAs is arteriovenous anastomosis.

1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:40.420
 So a connection between the arteries and the veins, yeah.

1:11:40.420 --> 1:11:41.820
 I actually use this technology.

1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:43.500
 I have a bulldog, bulldog mastiff.

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:47.860
 He has a very high propensity for overheating

1:11:47.860 --> 1:11:49.720
 because they're terrible at dumping heat

1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:53.020
 and bulldogs are great at pushing themselves

1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:54.740
 to the point of exhaustion or death.

1:11:54.740 --> 1:11:56.140
 It happens.

1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:59.540
 And so now we do what we call palmer cooling.

1:11:59.540 --> 1:12:00.960
 Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:02.880
 Where I'll take Costello and lower him

1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:05.140
 into a cool body of water,

1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:06.820
 just the bottoms of his paws.

1:12:06.820 --> 1:12:10.760
 Although I think animals instinctually know to do this

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:13.680
 and will go and stand in bodies of water.

1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:15.340
 They don't often lie down all the way.

1:12:15.340 --> 1:12:16.180
 Some do.

1:12:16.180 --> 1:12:17.140
 Yeah.

1:12:17.140 --> 1:12:20.020
 But they seem to know that's a great way

1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:21.140
 to cool themselves off.

1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:22.260
 Yeah.

1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:23.700
 Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:25.900
 And they get the advantage that their palms

1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:27.540
 and their feet are essentially the same thing.

1:12:27.540 --> 1:12:29.940
 So we actually built devices for dogs.

1:12:29.940 --> 1:12:30.780
 Did you really?

1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:31.600
 And tried them on.

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:34.780
 I did a rod sled dogs and it worked beautifully.

1:12:34.780 --> 1:12:38.100
 They had little backpacks with the equipment

1:12:38.100 --> 1:12:42.540
 and pads on all their feet and it worked beautifully.

1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:43.940
 Amazing. Amazing.

1:12:43.940 --> 1:12:47.200
 Along the lines of heating, deliberate heating,

1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:51.860
 wearing a knit cap is something that,

1:12:51.860 --> 1:12:53.860
 you see more of that on the East Coast.

1:12:53.860 --> 1:12:58.160
 People run around Boston and New England with a knit cap.

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.240
 I've always done that at the start of my runs

1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:01.940
 to try and warm up more quickly.

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:04.560
 And then I take it off, I shed layers as I go.

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:09.180
 Is that a rational practice the way I just described it?

1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:10.020
 Yeah.

1:13:10.020 --> 1:13:11.940
 Because warming up is important too.

1:13:11.940 --> 1:13:14.800
 There's a certain amount of quote unquote warming up

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:17.060
 that's required to lubricate joints

1:13:17.060 --> 1:13:19.380
 or at least to get the sense that joints are lubricated

1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:21.060
 and to be able to move more easily.

1:13:21.060 --> 1:13:21.900
 Yeah.

1:13:21.900 --> 1:13:24.380
 Do you still recommend that people warm up?

1:13:24.380 --> 1:13:28.800
 Yeah, but I think we're misled by the term warm up

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:33.120
 as if the major purpose is to raise temperature.

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.960
 I'm not aware of any data on this,

1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:39.600
 but I do think that the major contribution

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:41.700
 is increasing flexibility.

1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:44.700
 So you're going to avoid having damage

1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:48.220
 of joints and tendons and ligaments and so forth.

1:13:50.140 --> 1:13:54.860
 But also the ability of the mitochondria

1:13:54.860 --> 1:13:59.860
 to produce energy can be impaired at lower temperatures.

1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:01.940
 And you have to keep in mind

1:14:01.940 --> 1:14:04.940
 that we say our body temperature is 37 degrees,

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:06.540
 but that's not true.

1:14:06.540 --> 1:14:08.220
 Yeah, it varies across the day.

1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:10.860
 Well, it varies in parts of your body.

1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:14.500
 I mean, my hands and arms are not at 37 degrees right now.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:15.500
 They're much lower.

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:18.440
 So that raises an interesting question.

1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:22.460
 What is the best way to measure core body temperature?

1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:24.460
 Well, the best core temperature

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:28.020
 is that what we use is esophageal.

1:14:28.020 --> 1:14:30.820
 So we put a thermocouple up the nose

1:14:30.820 --> 1:14:32.860
 about two feet down the esophagus

1:14:32.860 --> 1:14:34.840
 so that it's about the level of your heart.

1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:37.860
 Not gym or home practical, although I don't know.

1:14:37.860 --> 1:14:40.260
 Some of those COVID swab tests go pretty far.

1:14:40.260 --> 1:14:42.120
 I can't even imagine it going any further.

1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:44.220
 I felt like my brain was getting tickled.

1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:46.860
 And it was really unpleasant.

1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:48.220
 Timpaniq is a pretty good-

1:14:48.220 --> 1:14:49.060
 So the ear.

1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:50.140
 The ear.

1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:53.420
 It's not foolproof because you have to actually

1:14:53.420 --> 1:14:56.180
 have it aimed properly at the tympanum.

1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:57.740
 And frequently what you're getting

1:14:57.740 --> 1:14:59.260
 is you're getting sort of a mixture

1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:02.340
 of tympanic plus ear canal temperature.

1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:04.540
 And for those listening and for those watching,

1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:06.900
 the tympanic is not going to be the pinna

1:15:06.900 --> 1:15:08.740
 that this part of the ear, the outer part of the ear,

1:15:08.740 --> 1:15:10.060
 the tympanic is going to be near the tympanic.

1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:11.860
 All headed towards the tympanic membrane.

1:15:11.860 --> 1:15:13.700
 And yes, I'm sticking my finger in my ear

1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:17.140
 because that's where the laser would actually have to go

1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:18.700
 to measure your temperature.

1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:20.220
 So when we're walking into restaurants

1:15:20.220 --> 1:15:21.260
 and other places nowadays,

1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:22.980
 and they're shining the laser at our forehead,

1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:25.740
 that's probably giving a pretty crude readout of temperature.

1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:28.420
 It is, but there's much less insulation

1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:31.020
 between your brain and your forehead skin

1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:34.480
 than there is between your biceps and your arm skin.

1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:37.900
 So if you're going to measure a surface temperature,

1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:39.060
 that's where you would do it.

1:15:39.060 --> 1:15:42.420
 And we do temperatures in the infrared.

1:15:42.420 --> 1:15:46.860
 We take infrared videos of athletes and our subjects.

1:15:46.860 --> 1:15:49.520
 And of course, the face lights up.

1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:51.300
 Okay, so if we're not,

1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:53.380
 I imagine there's going to be a technology coming soon

1:15:53.380 --> 1:15:56.140
 where you can point your smartwatch

1:15:56.140 --> 1:15:57.220
 or your smartphone at yourself

1:15:57.220 --> 1:15:58.700
 and you're going to get a heat map.

1:15:58.700 --> 1:15:59.540
 Right, right.

1:15:59.540 --> 1:16:01.020
 That's got to, if somebody out there

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:02.500
 hasn't already invented this

1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:04.820
 for the typical folks outside military,

1:16:04.820 --> 1:16:06.080
 somebody please invent that

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:10.180
 because I think there's growing interest in temperature

1:16:10.180 --> 1:16:11.600
 based on the work that you're doing.

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.460
 And also for sake of something I do want to touch on,

1:16:14.460 --> 1:16:16.500
 which is sleep and metabolism,

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.400
 although we don't want to open up those portals all the way

1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.540
 because we'd need several days to cover it.

1:16:22.820 --> 1:16:25.320
 Okay, so putting on the cap,

1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:28.940
 what about some of the helmets and gloves

1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:30.620
 that are used in typical sports?

1:16:30.620 --> 1:16:32.220
 Do you think that those can be improved

1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:34.420
 in order to improve performance

1:16:34.420 --> 1:16:36.180
 in terms of their ventilation ability

1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:40.100
 or keeping Palmer surfaces open, for instance?

1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:42.740
 Well, you mentioned about the knit cap

1:16:42.740 --> 1:16:44.500
 in cold weather especially,

1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:46.260
 and that is significant

1:16:46.260 --> 1:16:50.220
 because you do lose a lot of heat from your head,

1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:53.260
 but it's a constant heat loss.

1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:56.540
 It's not variable like your glibrous skin.

1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:59.740
 So if you decrease that heat loss,

1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:01.700
 you're going to be warmer.

1:17:01.700 --> 1:17:06.440
 So sure, that has an impact.

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:10.540
 Now, in terms of helmets, they should be ventilated.

1:17:10.540 --> 1:17:13.580
 I mean, they should have enough space in them

1:17:13.580 --> 1:17:17.180
 and holes in them so that air can circulate.

1:17:17.180 --> 1:17:22.180
 You don't want to thermally insulate your scalp.

1:17:22.460 --> 1:17:25.140
 That's going to decrease heat loss quite considerably.

1:17:25.140 --> 1:17:27.380
 You know, just for a resting individual,

1:17:27.380 --> 1:17:30.200
 the brain is about 20% of your metabolism.

1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:32.180
 So that's a lot of heat production.

1:17:32.180 --> 1:17:33.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:38.520
 I realized there was a question that I failed to ask earlier

1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:41.740
 that is burning in my mind now,

1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:43.740
 and I think is likely burning in the minds

1:17:43.740 --> 1:17:45.740
 of some of the listeners, which is,

1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:49.860
 so if you do this cooling in between sets in the gym,

1:17:49.860 --> 1:17:52.620
 you get this performance-enhancing effect.

1:17:52.620 --> 1:17:55.060
 You don't get the delayed onset muscle soreness,

1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:56.540
 which is great.

1:17:56.540 --> 1:17:59.080
 So presumably, the body is adapting.

1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:00.780
 You're getting better as a consequence

1:18:00.780 --> 1:18:03.180
 of being able to do more work per unit time

1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:06.140
 or to go harder in some way, of course.

1:18:07.580 --> 1:18:09.040
 You get that adaptation.

1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:12.620
 Does that mean that you see a performance-enhancing effect

1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:14.820
 even when you don't cool

1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:17.320
 if you've previously done the cooling workouts?

1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:19.740
 So for instance, let's say I can do 10 sets of 10 dips,

1:18:19.740 --> 1:18:21.660
 which I like to think I can.

1:18:21.660 --> 1:18:22.540
 Maybe I need to go try.

1:18:22.540 --> 1:18:24.020
 I don't know if I've done that recently.

1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:24.940
 I do the cooling.

1:18:24.940 --> 1:18:27.380
 I cool for three minutes between sets.

1:18:27.380 --> 1:18:30.260
 And let's say I get to the point

1:18:30.260 --> 1:18:33.900
 where I can do 20 for 10 sets,

1:18:33.900 --> 1:18:37.360
 10 sets of 20 repetitions, and then I don't cool.

1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:40.780
 Will I be able to match or approximate

1:18:40.780 --> 1:18:42.620
 my new, better performance?

1:18:42.620 --> 1:18:44.220
 You keep your gains.

1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:46.260
 It's a true conditioning effect.

1:18:46.260 --> 1:18:49.820
 You respond to the increased work volume

1:18:49.820 --> 1:18:52.460
 by all of those mechanisms you mentioned.

1:18:52.460 --> 1:18:53.280
 Amazing.

1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:55.140
 You increase the number of contractile elements

1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:56.180
 in your muscles.

1:18:56.180 --> 1:18:57.620
 The muscles get bigger.

1:18:57.620 --> 1:18:58.460
 Amazing.

1:18:58.460 --> 1:19:00.300
 We had an experiment that involved

1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:05.300
 some of our female students, not athletes,

1:19:05.420 --> 1:19:08.300
 but just regular, they were freshmen actually.

1:19:08.300 --> 1:19:12.460
 And the experiment was 10 sets of pushups

1:19:12.460 --> 1:19:15.220
 to muscle failure with or without cooling.

1:19:15.220 --> 1:19:17.300
 Same regimen, three minutes of cooling

1:19:17.300 --> 1:19:18.620
 in between sets of pushups?

1:19:18.620 --> 1:19:19.580
 Right.

1:19:19.580 --> 1:19:24.580
 Some of those young ladies reached over 800 pushups.

1:19:24.580 --> 1:19:26.840
 Now, the total duration of the workout

1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:28.600
 could be getting much longer as a consequence

1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:29.600
 of doing more work.

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:31.280
 No, it doesn't take you longer.

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:33.000
 Well, minor.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.560
 I mean, a pushup is pretty fast.

1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:35.500
 Yeah, it's pretty fast.

1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:40.080
 So you do 10 sets, the maximum 45 minutes total.

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:41.880
 That's a lot of pushups.

1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.600
 That's a lot of pushups.

1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:45.640
 So the interesting thing is they came in one day

1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:48.820
 and they said, Dr. Heller, you cost us a lot of money.

1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:49.660
 Why?

1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:51.200
 Well, we had a formal dance this weekend.

1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:53.320
 We all had to buy new sleeveless dresses.

1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:54.760
 Nice.

1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:56.260
 It's a good problem to have.

1:19:56.260 --> 1:19:57.360
 Good problem to have.

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:01.840
 Let's talk about steroids, anabolic steroids.

1:20:03.020 --> 1:20:05.080
 We're heading into an Olympics.

1:20:05.080 --> 1:20:07.240
 Every time the Olympics rolls around,

1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:10.100
 you hear about these cases of people getting popped,

1:20:10.100 --> 1:20:12.980
 as they call it, or caught for anabolic steroids.

1:20:12.980 --> 1:20:14.700
 There are some accusations out there now.

1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:16.280
 There'll be more.

1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:19.840
 This will get handled in the press

1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:22.000
 and in the various organizations.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:26.160
 Clearly athletes and non-athletes use anabolic steroids.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:27.800
 And typically anabolic steroids

1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:30.240
 are of the testosterone variety.

1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:32.720
 There are derivatives, et cetera.

1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:34.960
 And those derivatives do different things

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.920
 in anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera.

1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:41.480
 But typically the idea is, at least as I understand it,

1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:43.480
 in talking to some of these individuals,

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:47.520
 is that they allow people to train more

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:49.700
 because they recover faster.

1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:53.120
 They are able to synthesize more protein

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.680
 because they're basically getting a second puberty.

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:57.340
 Because as we all know, during puberty,

1:20:57.340 --> 1:20:59.140
 there's a lot of growth of the body.

1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:02.680
 And of course there are a lot of negative effects

1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:04.060
 of abuse of these things.

1:21:04.060 --> 1:21:07.820
 And they are banned from various sports organizations.

1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:10.140
 Especially, I should mention, in combat sports,

1:21:10.140 --> 1:21:13.760
 it's especially concerning because in combat sports,

1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:16.780
 a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody

1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:20.020
 more than you would be able to otherwise,

1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:21.940
 as opposed to in other sorts of sports,

1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:23.600
 just to conceptualize it.

1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:25.860
 And I'm not taking a moral stance on any of this.

1:21:25.860 --> 1:21:28.060
 I just want to ask you,

1:21:28.060 --> 1:21:32.940
 when you compare Palmer cooling to anabolic steroids

1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:37.940
 in terms of gym performance, what do you see?

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:41.620
 Well, we do not do research on steroids,

1:21:41.620 --> 1:21:46.620
 but there is a lot of research in the literature.

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:51.160
 A lot of that research in the strength conditioning

1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:55.320
 magazines is not very scientific.

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.400
 No. Okay.

1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:58.320
 Or it might not even be scientific at all.

1:21:58.320 --> 1:21:59.160
 Right. Right.

1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:02.760
 But we did do an analysis of reputable papers.

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:06.960
 And we did find, I think it was probably eight or nine,

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:11.960
 10 studies on bench press, increase in bench press

1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:15.160
 performance on steroids or not.

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:16.160
 Okay.

1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:18.000
 These were males or females?

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.640
 Well, these were all males,

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:22.200
 but I'll get back to the females.

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:23.520
 Okay.

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:28.400
 The bottom line is that in all of these independent studies,

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:33.400
 their rate of improvement was approximately 1% per week.

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:34.920
 Okay.

1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:35.740
 Okay.

1:22:35.740 --> 1:22:38.360
 And I just told you about studies

1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:42.680
 in which we've had 300% increase in a month.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:49.560
 It's an enormous, enormous difference.

1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:51.920
 So why would you endanger your health

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:55.400
 as well as your legal ability to compete

1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:58.280
 with such an ineffective tool?

1:22:58.280 --> 1:22:59.120
 Yeah.

1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:03.480
 No, I think the notion of performance enhancement

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:04.900
 is a really interesting one,

1:23:04.900 --> 1:23:07.880
 because people clearly pay attention to nutrition.

1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:10.800
 Sleep is now something that I think everybody,

1:23:10.800 --> 1:23:12.840
 but especially athletes are paying attention to.

1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:14.240
 Right.

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:17.400
 And I predict that temperature will be one

1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:21.440
 of the more powerful parameters

1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:23.180
 that people are going to be focusing on.

1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:24.020
 Yeah.

1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:25.820
 Because of the magnitude of the effects

1:23:25.820 --> 1:23:27.160
 that you're describing.

1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:30.960
 And also because so much of the variability

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:32.480
 around performance, as you mentioned,

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:35.840
 has to do with when you go to a new environment.

1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:39.360
 Everyone has their home environment worked out pretty well.

1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:40.880
 Sleep well in your own bed at home.

1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:42.600
 When you can control everything,

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:43.840
 your performance is always great.

1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:45.720
 This is why I think military special operators

1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:48.000
 are a particularly interesting group,

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.600
 because their whole world is centered around elite

1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:56.200
 and high performance with very high risk, high consequence,

1:23:56.200 --> 1:23:58.200
 under variable conditions.

1:23:58.200 --> 1:23:59.400
 The essence of their work

1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:01.900
 is variable, unpredictable conditions.

1:24:01.900 --> 1:24:05.280
 So you mentioned female athletes and steroids.

1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:06.600
 I'm curious about this.

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:08.720
 Yeah, because everybody has always said to us,

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:11.280
 well, you only use male subjects,

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:14.480
 and obviously they have this testosterone background.

1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:16.320
 They have higher levels of testosterone.

1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:18.200
 That's why you get these results.

1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:20.780
 So we did a comparative study on females.

1:24:20.780 --> 1:24:22.880
 We get the same results.

1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:23.720
 Impressive.

1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:25.920
 And these are our Stanford athletes or also-

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:27.280
 No, these were not Stanford athletes.

1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:31.120
 They were Stanford students, but not athletes.

1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:34.000
 Well, we have done, of course, work on some athletes,

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:37.420
 but in general, we don't do research on our teams,

1:24:37.420 --> 1:24:40.580
 our varsity teams, so they have their own protocols.

1:24:40.580 --> 1:24:42.440
 They have their own training programs.

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.560
 Yeah, they don't like us to get too close to them.

1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:46.680
 No, I work with some of these folks and the coaches,

1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:49.000
 and they are very skeptical, with good reason.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:54.000
 Also, and the reason I ask is that when you see these PAC-10

1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:56.320
 or Division I college athletes,

1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:58.120
 and then you see their peers,

1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:01.280
 there's clearly a difference, right?

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:05.000
 I mean, they are pedigreed throughout, right?

1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:10.320
 And more typical folks also have different goals.

1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:13.200
 They may not want to get infinitely stronger

1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:14.840
 or perform more endurance work.

1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:18.200
 So I want to ask you a couple of things

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.920
 about shivering and metabolism,

1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:22.960
 because I think they're very interesting

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:25.180
 and sufficiently related.

1:25:25.180 --> 1:25:29.940
 So my understanding is that shiver is an adaptation

1:25:29.940 --> 1:25:31.520
 that's designed to heat us up,

1:25:32.680 --> 1:25:36.880
 that we have brown fat that's in compartments

1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:39.680
 around our body that are activated by shiver

1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:41.900
 or coactivated by shiver,

1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:46.600
 and that shivering is useful for increasing metabolism.

1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:48.080
 Is that true?

1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:50.760
 And does it require that cold be the stimulus?

1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:53.260
 So two scenarios, I'll give you an experiment.

1:25:53.260 --> 1:25:56.060
 I put someone into cold water of some sort,

1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:58.520
 and then I make them get out or I have them stand near it,

1:25:58.520 --> 1:25:59.840
 and then they start shivering.

1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:03.740
 My understanding is that their metabolism will increase.

1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:06.900
 What if I take someone and I just have them shiver,

1:26:06.900 --> 1:26:08.120
 but they're not exposed by cold?

1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:09.940
 It's kind of a deliberate shivering.

1:26:09.940 --> 1:26:14.740
 Will that also create a substantial increase in metabolism?

1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:15.620
 Sure.

1:26:15.620 --> 1:26:19.180
 So deliberate shivering without cold

1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:21.680
 is essentially what happens when you get a fever.

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.400
 Your set point goes up and you're hypothalamus,

1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:28.760
 and you actually, even though you're normal body temperature

1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:31.080
 your thermostat is telling you you're too cold,

1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:33.220
 increase your metabolism, so shiver.

1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:39.140
 So sure, shivering is a good way of increasing metabolism,

1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:41.040
 but it only can take metabolism up

1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:43.040
 maybe three or four times resting.

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:48.120
 Whereas exercise can take you up 10 times.

1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:48.960
 Got it.

1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:51.120
 All right, I'm gonna ask a couple of more random questions

1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:53.720
 and seemingly random.

1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:55.380
 Do bears actually hibernate?

1:26:55.380 --> 1:26:56.320
 Oh yeah.

1:26:56.320 --> 1:26:58.200
 The true hibernation?

1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.240
 Well, it depends on how you define true.

1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:04.920
 A bear, actually we've done a lot of work on bears.

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.400
 Do you also put the nose thermocouple down in the esophagus?

1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:10.960
 We implant them surgically.

1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:12.800
 Okay, they're anesthetized when you implant them.

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:13.640
 Yes.

1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:14.460
 What kind of bears are these?

1:27:14.460 --> 1:27:15.300
 Black bears.

1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:16.140
 Okay.

1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:18.240
 And did this with colleagues at University of Alaska,

1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:19.920
 and we're analyzing the data now,

1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.480
 but what we've done is we've had now a total of 18 bears,

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:29.280
 and we implant them with EEG, EKG, temperature sensors,

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:31.840
 and sometimes we actually measure their oxygen consumption.

1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:32.900
 These are bears in the wild.

1:27:32.900 --> 1:27:34.120
 These are bears in the wild,

1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:36.800
 but they're brought in to University of Alaska

1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:38.940
 where we keep them in an outdoor enclosure,

1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:42.560
 so they're hibernating in a nest box in an enclosure,

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.360
 and we're recording this electrophysiological data

1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:47.200
 continuously for six months.

1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:48.040
 Amazing.

1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:49.440
 How do I get on this protocol?

1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:53.520
 Craig and I are doing some work together going forward,

1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.280
 and maybe you can slide me onto this protocol too.

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:57.320
 That sounds amazing.

1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:00.680
 Right now, it's a matter of just analyzing the gigabytes,

1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:03.840
 terabytes of data that have been collected.

1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:05.880
 But anyway, you asked about hibernation.

1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:10.880
 So bears only go down to about 33, 34 degrees centigrade

1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:15.120
 in core temperature, and that's been argued that,

1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:16.400
 well, they can't go lower

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:18.240
 because they have so much insulation.

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:21.060
 They're so big, their surface volume ratio and so forth,

1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:22.600
 and that's not true.

1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:23.640
 They shiver.

1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:27.320
 So if we have a day like minus 40,

1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:30.480
 which you get up in Alaska,

1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:32.780
 they will go through periods of shivering

1:28:32.780 --> 1:28:35.940
 and maintain a core temperature on 33, 34.

1:28:35.940 --> 1:28:38.660
 Now, the ground squirrels and the marmots,

1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:41.120
 which are smaller animals,

1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:44.400
 they will drop down to a body temperature,

1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:47.620
 maybe within a degree of the environment.

1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:50.600
 So they can go down to one or two degrees centigrade,

1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:54.320
 just above freezing during bouts of hibernation.

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:56.720
 So they'll stay in hibernation for seven or eight days,

1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:58.680
 and they'll come back up to normal body temperature

1:28:58.680 --> 1:28:59.520
 for a day.

1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:00.360
 Then they'll go back down and do another job.

1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:01.340
 What do they do during that day

1:29:01.340 --> 1:29:02.720
 when they're warming up again?

1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:03.560
 Do they go around?

1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:07.200
 They rearrange their nests, eat, if they've stored food.

1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:09.120
 Some species store lots of food.

1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:10.880
 Others just depend on their fat.

1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:14.760
 A former mentor of mine, my master's degree mentor,

1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:17.820
 and a colleague and friend of yours,

1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:21.320
 Irving Zucker at UC Berkeley, told me a story once,

1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:22.280
 told me a lot of stories.

1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:24.040
 He tells great stories, as you know.

1:29:24.040 --> 1:29:27.240
 He told me that when an animal comes out of hibernation

1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:31.440
 periodically, that it's a very dramatic thing to observe.

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:34.320
 That it's not like they wake up and yawn and look around,

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:37.660
 but it's like a complete epileptic seizure.

1:29:37.660 --> 1:29:39.360
 What's going on there?

1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:40.200
 Shivering.

1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:42.040
 It's just a very dramatic shiver.

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:45.600
 So at the low temperatures, they cannot shiver

1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:48.680
 because the effect of temperature on the conduction

1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:50.880
 of the nerves and the muscle fibers.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:52.080
 So they're shut down, basically.

1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:52.920
 They're shut down.

1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:54.320
 So there they use brown fat.

1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:55.680
 So activate brown fat.

1:29:55.680 --> 1:29:57.560
 And then when they get up to a temperature

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:59.840
 of maybe 15, 16 degrees centigrade,

1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:02.640
 then the shivering starts and it gets very, very violent.

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:05.320
 But they're still asleep.

1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:08.100
 Do we shiver in our sleep?

1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:12.380
 I would imagine we do, but it probably wakes us up.

1:30:12.380 --> 1:30:13.220
 Interesting.

1:30:13.220 --> 1:30:16.140
 So the brown fat is kind of like kindling.

1:30:16.140 --> 1:30:21.140
 The brown fat is a tissue which has lots of stored energy

1:30:22.220 --> 1:30:24.000
 because it's fat.

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.900
 But unlike our white fat, our regular fat,

1:30:26.900 --> 1:30:29.760
 it also has lots of these little powerhouses,

1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:32.740
 mitochondria, and lots of blood supply.

1:30:32.740 --> 1:30:36.880
 So essentially it is a tissue just to produce heat.

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:38.260
 That's what it's there for.

1:30:38.260 --> 1:30:40.260
 Now, in these hibernators,

1:30:40.260 --> 1:30:43.560
 there are big patches of brown fat at certain locations

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:46.800
 that are critical, like around the heart, for example.

1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:49.780
 For us, the brown fat is sort of distributed.

1:30:49.780 --> 1:30:51.740
 So for many, many years,

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:54.100
 it was thought humans don't have brown fat,

1:30:54.100 --> 1:30:55.560
 but indeed we do.

1:30:55.560 --> 1:30:59.020
 It's just not localized into discrete fat pads

1:30:59.020 --> 1:31:02.980
 like it is in ground squirrels, marmots.

1:31:02.980 --> 1:31:06.260
 I don't know why the phrase fat pads is so satisfying to say,

1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:08.460
 but it is fat pads.

1:31:08.460 --> 1:31:12.780
 Speaking of fat pads, I was taught that we have,

1:31:13.780 --> 1:31:15.020
 by the internet, I should say,

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:18.100
 I was taught by the internet that we have brown fat

1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:20.460
 between our scapulae and our upper neck.

1:31:20.460 --> 1:31:24.420
 Is that truly a source of brown enrichment for brown fat?

1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:26.500
 If you're a ground squirrel.

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:29.040
 So it's completely, this is all the drawings out there.

1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:32.180
 Okay, so what I'm hearing you say is that brown fat

1:31:32.180 --> 1:31:33.700
 is actually distributed in patches.

1:31:33.700 --> 1:31:38.420
 In humans, it's distributed along with other fat tissue.

1:31:38.420 --> 1:31:41.060
 It's not as discrete.

1:31:41.060 --> 1:31:44.640
 So the reason I'm kind of shocked and amused

1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:47.380
 and troubled by this

1:31:47.380 --> 1:31:52.380
 is because there is a somewhat standard protocol

1:31:52.600 --> 1:31:55.620
 in the performance wellness, whatever, world,

1:31:55.620 --> 1:31:56.760
 whatever you want to call it,

1:31:56.760 --> 1:31:59.860
 of putting ice packs on the upper back

1:31:59.860 --> 1:32:04.480
 as a way to stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:09.060
 I'm hearing some inhales of concern from the physiologist.

1:32:09.060 --> 1:32:12.100
 So tell me why, it sounds like that's probably not

1:32:12.100 --> 1:32:14.880
 the best way to stimulate brown fat activation.

1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:17.140
 Well, let's put it this way.

1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:18.760
 You're not attacking anyone specifically

1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.480
 because the whole world believes this.

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:21.420
 So it doesn't-

1:32:21.420 --> 1:32:26.140
 But it may not be totally facetious or false.

1:32:26.140 --> 1:32:27.540
 Think of what that's doing.

1:32:27.540 --> 1:32:31.100
 If you put ice right there where your spinal cord

1:32:31.100 --> 1:32:32.800
 is close to the surface,

1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:35.400
 that's where you're going to hit the vertebral arteries.

1:32:35.400 --> 1:32:38.060
 So you're essentially putting a cold source

1:32:38.060 --> 1:32:40.340
 into the brain to the hypothalamus.

1:32:40.340 --> 1:32:43.340
 The hypothalamus says you're too cold,

1:32:43.340 --> 1:32:47.860
 so it is going to turn on shivering and brown fat.

1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:49.160
 So-

1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:50.660
 Would there be a better site

1:32:51.900 --> 1:32:54.060
 for sake of activating brown fat?

1:32:54.060 --> 1:32:56.200
 Um...

1:32:56.200 --> 1:32:57.040
 Polymer cooling?

1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:03.680
 You know, I can't say because the activation of brown fat

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:07.620
 is a sympathetic nervous system response.

1:33:07.620 --> 1:33:10.680
 So any lowering of core temperature

1:33:10.680 --> 1:33:15.200
 that will let the thermostat say you're too cold

1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:16.960
 is going to turn on sympathetic.

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:20.640
 Now, people will have perhaps different amounts

1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:22.020
 of brown fat.

1:33:22.020 --> 1:33:25.760
 So newborn have more brown fat than adults.

1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:26.600
 And probably-

1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:27.700
 Because newborns can't shiver, correct?

1:33:27.700 --> 1:33:28.540
 I don't know.

1:33:28.540 --> 1:33:29.860
 Okay, that's what I read.

1:33:29.860 --> 1:33:30.700
 I don't know if it's true.

1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:32.080
 Yeah, I don't know.

1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:34.680
 I read that in what I believe to be credible sources,

1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:35.520
 but-

1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:36.340
 Yeah, it could be.

1:33:36.340 --> 1:33:37.180
 I just don't know.

1:33:37.180 --> 1:33:40.140
 It depends on if it's really newborn.

1:33:40.140 --> 1:33:42.300
 I can agree because you don't have

1:33:42.300 --> 1:33:46.320
 all of the motor pathways connected up yet.

1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:49.800
 That's something that occurs in early days of life

1:33:49.800 --> 1:33:52.200
 and is probably one of the functions of REM sleep,

1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:55.800
 which infants have a lot of.

1:33:55.800 --> 1:33:56.640
 Right.

1:33:56.640 --> 1:33:57.460
 Okay.

1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:59.560
 But how to activate brown fat?

1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:02.880
 If you are consistently exposed to cold,

1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:05.380
 so if you live in the Arctic

1:34:05.380 --> 1:34:08.080
 and you go out jogging in the winter,

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:11.040
 maybe that will increase the amount of brown fat you have.

1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:13.920
 If you live in the tropics, maybe you have less brown fat.

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:14.760
 I don't know.

1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:17.720
 I don't know of any studies which have looked into that.

1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:18.840
 Okay.

1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:20.420
 Ice headache.

1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:22.040
 Sometimes I'll drink a cold beverage

1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.920
 or I'll eat ice cream and my head will-

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:26.920
 Brain freeze.

1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:27.760
 Brain freeze.

1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:30.760
 And speaking of special forces, I was talking to,

1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:35.560
 we all see the images, the SEAL training slash screening

1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:37.680
 in Coronado where they're going in and out of the Pacific,

1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:38.920
 which is very cold.

1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:41.800
 But I know they also spend some time

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:44.720
 in the very cold waters of Kodiak, Alaska.

1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:46.680
 You mentioned Alaska.

1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:49.240
 Brain freeze, so-called ice headache,

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:54.240
 is a common occurrence there in those situations.

1:34:54.660 --> 1:34:56.220
 But we all have experienced this.

1:34:56.220 --> 1:34:58.560
 We eat ice cream, we get that brain freeze.

1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:00.940
 I can feel it right now a little bit subjectively.

1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:02.020
 I can induce it.

1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:04.000
 What's going on there?

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.200
 And I would always just rub my tongue

1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:07.220
 on the roof of my mouth.

1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:09.760
 Is there something that I'm doing that's functional there

1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:11.320
 just to try and alleviate it?

1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:12.160
 Good question.

1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:14.320
 The thing is that the roof of your mouth

1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:16.780
 is very close to your hypothalamus.

1:35:16.780 --> 1:35:20.000
 So if indeed it's a popsicle

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:21.600
 that's giving you the brain freeze,

1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:24.720
 it may be a direct cooling effect

1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:25.800
 from the roof of your mouth.

1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:26.860
 You put your tongue there,

1:35:26.860 --> 1:35:28.880
 you're insulating the roof of your mouth.

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:29.920
 I don't know.

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:30.760
 I'm guessing.

1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:32.720
 But what's the source of the brain freeze?

1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:34.200
 Is it a vasoconstriction?

1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:36.800
 It's a vasomotor change.

1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:37.980
 Whether it's constriction,

1:35:37.980 --> 1:35:39.960
 I think it's more likely a vaso,

1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:41.820
 an increase in blood pressure,

1:35:41.820 --> 1:35:45.600
 which will essentially cause an expansion of the arteries

1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:48.200
 and activate pain receptors.

1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:50.840
 We don't have pain receptors in the neural tissue,

1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:51.680
 in the brain.

1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:53.280
 We have them in the meninges

1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:56.320
 and predominantly associated with the blood vessels,

1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:57.880
 the walls of the blood vessels.

1:35:57.880 --> 1:35:58.840
 So if you have something

1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:03.840
 which will dramatically increase your blood pressure

1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:07.200
 going to the brain, you're likely to get a...

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:11.040
 We've had some preliminary data.

1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:12.400
 I even hate to mention this

1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:16.380
 because we have not been able to pursue it systematically,

1:36:16.380 --> 1:36:21.380
 but we've had some experience with people with migraine

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.980
 that say if they use one of our devices to heat,

1:36:26.980 --> 1:36:28.360
 that the migraine goes away.

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:31.920
 And I don't know.

1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:32.760
 You know, the idea-

1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:33.580
 It's very interesting.

1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:34.420
 A lot of people suffer from migraine.

1:36:34.420 --> 1:36:36.800
 I know there are a lot of different types of migraine.

1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:37.640
 Right.

1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:38.640
 I've been reading a lot about this lately

1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:41.960
 because I get so many questions about migraine.

1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:42.800
 But-

1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:43.640
 I hate to say anything.

1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:44.480
 Sure.

1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:46.120
 And we'll just underscore this as preliminary.

1:36:46.120 --> 1:36:49.420
 And people have been great about understanding

1:36:49.420 --> 1:36:50.720
 that when we say preliminary,

1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:54.680
 we mean it has not passed through the required filters

1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:57.960
 to call it hard fact yet.

1:36:57.960 --> 1:36:59.920
 We don't even have a decent data set.

1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:00.920
 Right.

1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:02.440
 These are anecdotal reports.

1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:04.000
 Anecdata, as people like to call it.

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:05.440
 But I don't even like to call it that

1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:07.520
 because then we don't want to give it more weight

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:08.360
 than it deserves.

1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:09.900
 That's interesting.

1:37:09.900 --> 1:37:12.560
 The ice headache and the increase in blood pressure

1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:15.380
 is interesting because the only thing that I've heard

1:37:15.380 --> 1:37:19.160
 is similar to it is something that comes from,

1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:20.380
 you know, they have these competitions

1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:22.960
 where people eat these very hot chili peppers.

1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:24.000
 You know, it's kind of a-

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:24.840
 Yeah.

1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:28.320
 An ego thing, I guess, for reasons that escape me,

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:29.840
 that eating really hot peppers.

1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:31.940
 And every once in a while, someone will eat one of these

1:37:31.940 --> 1:37:33.920
 and get what's called thunderclap headache,

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:36.920
 where a headache comes on extremely quickly.

1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:39.520
 And so quickly that it's caused,

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:42.120
 so severe, rather, that it's been known

1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:44.520
 to cause stroke and brain damage.

1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:46.680
 So these very, very hot peppers,

1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:48.380
 if you're not acclimated to them,

1:37:48.380 --> 1:37:49.560
 and maybe even if you are,

1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:52.260
 have been shown to actually cause brain damage.

1:37:52.260 --> 1:37:53.100
 Yeah.

1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:54.260
 Some good evidence for this.

1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:58.360
 I do want to talk about something

1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:01.640
 that we have not touched on yet,

1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:06.640
 which is NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis.

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:07.480
 Right?

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:11.280
 So non-activity associated thermogenesis

1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:12.940
 and the fidgeters, right?

1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:15.880
 So the classic work of like Rothwell and Stock

1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:19.840
 and the idea that some people who overeat

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:23.740
 are burning off that energy by way of shaking their knee

1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:24.840
 or moving around a lot.

1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:26.400
 These are the kind of nerve, they quote,

1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:28.040
 you know, quote unquote nervous types.

1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:31.920
 But they quoted in those studies,

1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:34.440
 a huge degree of caloric burn, you know,

1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:37.440
 800, 2,500 calories per day burned

1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:39.960
 above those who sit rather still.

1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:42.140
 Does that seem far-fetched?

1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:45.240
 Those are older data, but any comment on NEAT

1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:48.440
 or non-exercise induced thermogenesis?

1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:50.640
 Well, I do think it's pretty straightforward

1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:53.240
 that if you increase muscle activity of any kind,

1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:55.720
 you're increasing your energy consumption

1:38:55.720 --> 1:38:57.440
 and your heat production.

1:38:57.440 --> 1:38:59.760
 And no, the really extreme example

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:02.820
 is hyper and hypothyroidism.

1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:05.680
 People that are hyperthyroid are fidgety

1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:07.640
 and you know, they have a high metabolic rate

1:39:07.640 --> 1:39:09.360
 and they're hot.

1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:12.160
 And people that are hypothermic are cool.

1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:15.200
 They're not, they don't move very much.

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:17.800
 So any kind of muscle activity increases.

1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:20.540
 And when you say, you know, it's not much activity,

1:39:20.540 --> 1:39:23.440
 but remember it's only 20% effective.

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.900
 80% of the energy is going to heat.

1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:32.240
 So it may not exert much energy to tap your foot,

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:35.680
 but four times the amount of energy

1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:39.360
 that is going into the movement is being lost as heat.

1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:41.840
 That's very interesting.

1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:44.080
 A couple more quick questions.

1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:46.300
 There's a lot of excitement these days,

1:39:46.300 --> 1:39:48.920
 or at least usage these days of so-called energy drinks

1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:50.640
 or pre-workout drinks.

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.320
 Many of these contain thermogenic compounds.

1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:57.600
 So caffeine, things, there's a culture now

1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:01.880
 of taking arginine, things that support arginine.

1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:06.280
 So, you know, beet juice and L-citrulline,

1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.040
 things to dilate the blood vessels.

1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:10.520
 Sometimes this is for sake of increasing blood flow

1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:12.200
 to the muscles during resistance exercise.

1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:14.200
 But a lot of these are thermogenic.

1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:16.320
 It's to increase body temperature.

1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:19.160
 And is it possible that some of these energy drinks

1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:21.660
 are actually, or similar, you know,

1:40:21.660 --> 1:40:23.600
 six espresso or whatever it is,

1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:27.560
 are acting to prevent optimal performance

1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:29.320
 or reduce performance?

1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:33.660
 I don't think that the temperature rise is that.

1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:35.680
 I really don't know.

1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:38.800
 But what it does is it makes you more jittery

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:40.920
 and you're going to increase that neat

1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:42.360
 that you were talking about.

1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:45.480
 Or it's another thing, and that is that

1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:48.720
 when you are exercising your muscle

1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.320
 and it becomes slightly hypoxic,

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:56.780
 I mean, the oxygen supply is not enough,

1:40:56.780 --> 1:40:59.760
 the muscle releases adenosine.

1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:01.880
 And what adenosine does in the muscle

1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:05.660
 is cause the blood vessels to open up, to dilate.

1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:09.240
 So it's a way of increasing the blood flow to the muscle

1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:11.600
 and therefore the oxygen supply to the muscle.

1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:14.640
 And caffeine is essentially an adenosine antagonist.

1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:16.800
 An adenosine antagonist, right.

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:21.500
 So under the strict logic, ingesting caffeine

1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:23.480
 will reduce adenosine release

1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:27.480
 and will reduce oxygen utilization at the muscle.

1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:29.520
 So that would lead me to believe

1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:33.320
 that motivational support aside,

1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:37.040
 that caffeine will hinder muscular performance.

1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:38.120
 I would think so,

1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:43.120
 but I can't give you an authoritative answer on that.

1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:46.340
 Okay, we're just going through the logic

1:41:46.340 --> 1:41:48.080
 and the gymnastics around that.

1:41:49.820 --> 1:41:52.480
 I think it's a fascinating area that deserves attention

1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:56.400
 because the question of what one can ingest

1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:57.980
 in order to perform better,

1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:00.900
 to say nothing of hormone augmentation,

1:42:00.900 --> 1:42:05.900
 but has often leads back to stimulants.

1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:08.060
 And if those stimulants,

1:42:08.060 --> 1:42:10.760
 most of which include caffeine of some sort,

1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:13.080
 are inhibiting the adenosine system

1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:14.000
 and the adenosine system

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000
 is supporting the oxygenation of muscle,

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.960
 then I would imagine that avoiding them

1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:21.880
 might be the better option.

1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:26.880
 Yeah, I just am not aware of data that would...

1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:30.400
 So this is a general phenomenon of adenosine

1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:31.880
 and blood flow.

1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:34.360
 It has, of course, a different effect in the brain.

1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:38.600
 Adenosine causes sleep, so caffeine keeps you awake.

1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:40.280
 And if you stay awake,

1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:42.000
 you're going to have a higher metabolic rate

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.140
 than if you go to sleep.

1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:48.940
 So, and the thing is you say energy drinks.

1:42:48.940 --> 1:42:52.240
 The question is, what really is in them?

1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:54.320
 It's usually a cocktail of things.

1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:55.160
 I don't take these.

1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:56.020
 I don't like them at all,

1:42:56.020 --> 1:42:59.280
 but they're usually a combination of vasodilators,

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:01.320
 stimulant, caffeine, some sort of stimulant.

1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:02.760
 And a source of glucose.

1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:05.000
 Sometimes a source of glucose and sometimes not.

1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:10.000
 And oftentimes there are vasodilators

1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.160
 and there are compounds

1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:16.760
 that are thought to be so-called nootropics, smart drugs,

1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:18.840
 that basically increase acetylcholine

1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:21.060
 or norepinephrine transmission.

1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:25.280
 You know, in the 80s and 90s,

1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:28.680
 the beta-3 agonists like clambuterol were very popular,

1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:30.080
 but they were all banned.

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:32.320
 So those are all banned from...

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:33.920
 Although people use them recreationally,

1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:35.560
 which I do not recommend.

1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:36.880
 There were actually a number of deaths

1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:39.560
 due to dehydration, overheating,

1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:41.660
 as well as cardiac effects.

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:44.040
 Before we wrap up,

1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:46.800
 I know you've done a ton of work on sleep.

1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:48.700
 I think we're going to have to do another episode

1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:50.200
 about your work on sleep

1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:52.720
 because the amount of data that you produce there

1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:54.080
 is vast, actually.

1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:56.080
 So I first got to know you and your work

1:43:57.280 --> 1:43:59.400
 related to sleep and temperature.

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:02.960
 We all hear nowadays that it's good to keep the room

1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:05.480
 that you sleep in cool, keep it dark.

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:08.480
 I've talked a number of times on podcast episodes

1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:11.780
 about the role of light and shifting in circadian rhythms.

1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:15.140
 I have two questions related to sleep.

1:44:15.140 --> 1:44:18.240
 One is, are there any things

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:21.420
 that may or may not relate to temperature,

1:44:21.420 --> 1:44:26.000
 but that you think are very useful for getting better sleep

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.020
 that you don't hear that much about,

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:33.120
 that people might want to consider or try,

1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:34.480
 realizing that there are a lot of reasons

1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:36.480
 why people don't sleep great,

1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:39.280
 but what are some things that you don't hear

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:43.080
 that much about these days that you wish people knew?

1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:45.640
 Well, the sleep medicine community

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:50.640
 now puts a lot more emphasis on cognitive behavioral therapy

1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:53.120
 than on pharmacology.

1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:55.920
 So what cognitive behavioral therapy does

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:59.720
 is it essentially increases your sleep hygiene.

1:44:59.720 --> 1:45:02.720
 So there are certain just general rules.

1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:06.200
 So have a regular bedtime and a regular arousal time.

1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:08.840
 Don't be skipping back and forth all the time.

1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:10.160
 Arousal, you mean wake-up time.

1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:11.200
 Wake-up time, yeah.

1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:12.600
 Spoken like a true physiologist.

1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.600
 Yeah.

1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:20.780
 Another thing is don't use screens

1:45:20.780 --> 1:45:22.520
 within a couple hours of bedtime

1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:26.860
 because screens are predominantly rich in blue light.

1:45:26.860 --> 1:45:29.560
 And what that does is you mentioned the circadian system.

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:31.580
 That affects your circadian system.

1:45:31.580 --> 1:45:36.580
 That pushes off your circadian stimulus for sleep, okay?

1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:40.520
 Another thing is, of course, relax.

1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:42.600
 I mean, don't work right up till the time

1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:44.280
 you're going to bed.

1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:46.640
 Take some time to do something relaxing.

1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:50.180
 And then temperature, you've mentioned that.

1:45:50.180 --> 1:45:55.180
 And for many people, a warm bath is really conducive

1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:57.040
 to good sleep.

1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:01.480
 And people are now swearing by a cooler environment

1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:02.680
 for sleep.

1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:06.120
 And that makes sense in terms of the circadian effect

1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:07.700
 on body temperature.

1:46:07.700 --> 1:46:12.700
 So our circadian clock is affecting our thermostat.

1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:15.720
 So at the time we go to bed, our thermostat

1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:19.760
 is on its way down to a lower set point, okay?

1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:20.600
 So what happens?

1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:24.060
 You go to bed and you're feeling a little bit cool.

1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:26.960
 So you pile on lots of blankets.

1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:29.920
 And then what happens is you wake up a little bit later

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:31.340
 and you're hot, so you throw them off.

1:46:31.340 --> 1:46:35.200
 It's because your thermostat has set downward.

1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:37.760
 Now, why is it better to have a cool environment?

1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:39.380
 It's better to have a cool environment

1:46:39.380 --> 1:46:42.320
 because it's easier to thermoregulate.

1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:44.720
 So you can go to Europe in the summertime

1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:47.960
 and the hotel rooms still have these big comforters,

1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:50.040
 these down comforters.

1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:51.800
 So how do you deal with that?

1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:55.000
 You stick out your hands and your legs, okay?

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.200
 I've always slept with, I have one leg

1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:00.000
 that just kind of hangs out of the, yeah.

1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:03.400
 But that's, they're your heat loss surfaces, right?

1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:04.880
 So if you're in a cool environment,

1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:06.600
 you can take advantage of that.

1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:09.340
 You can take advantage by passively

1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:10.960
 regulating your body temperature.

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:13.840
 You don't have to get up and wake up and say,

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:16.060
 oh my God, I got to change the covers

1:47:16.060 --> 1:47:17.680
 or blankets or what have you.

1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:20.800
 If you're in a warm environment, what can you do?

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:23.600
 You need to sleep with one hand in the cool mitt, right?

1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:25.480
 And right now that's not available yet.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:26.960
 Right, it's not available.

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.760
 I've never heard about it that way.

1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:31.120
 I've always heard you want to sleep in a cool room

1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:33.120
 or keep the room cold.

1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:35.720
 But I never realized why that's useful,

1:47:35.720 --> 1:47:37.320
 which is, as you're saying,

1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:41.640
 that then you can move these glabrous surfaces in and out.

1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:43.200
 You could even, I'll sometimes even wake up

1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:45.320
 under the blanket completely.

1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:47.140
 Very, very interesting.

1:47:47.140 --> 1:47:51.940
 That finally a rational science grounded explanation

1:47:51.940 --> 1:47:53.640
 for why we need to sleep in a cool room.

1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:54.480
 Because I always thought, well,

1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:56.080
 if your temperature is going down anyway,

1:47:56.080 --> 1:47:57.620
 why do you have to sleep in a cool room?

1:47:57.620 --> 1:47:59.400
 What about wearing socks while you sleep?

1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:01.000
 That was big a few years ago where they said,

1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:02.820
 you know, you should put socks on.

1:48:02.820 --> 1:48:05.300
 Now I would think that's probably the wrong advice.

1:48:05.300 --> 1:48:06.140
 You probably just-

1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:08.260
 Well, I don't know if it's wrong advice.

1:48:08.260 --> 1:48:12.220
 There's an old, old study that was supported by,

1:48:12.220 --> 1:48:17.220
 I think, Eddie Bauer, the sleeping bag company.

1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:21.360
 And what the study showed, what the study was asking is,

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:24.340
 what are the most temperature sensitive spots in the body?

1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:26.000
 Where do you feel cold?

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.880
 And what that showed was it was the toes.

1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:29.720
 So-

1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:30.540
 Makes sense.

1:48:30.540 --> 1:48:31.720
 So when you sample water with your toe,

1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:33.560
 you always see that.

1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:37.600
 So the socks essentially are promoting thermal comfort

1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:40.900
 by insulating that area that's quite sensitive.

1:48:40.900 --> 1:48:42.120
 Now, of course, if it's too warm,

1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:43.420
 you're not going to put socks on.

1:48:43.420 --> 1:48:44.460
 Right.

1:48:44.460 --> 1:48:47.000
 Well, Craig, thank you so much.

1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.800
 You gave so much information

1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:51.760
 that's actionable and interesting.

1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:55.060
 I know a lot of people are going to be really interested

1:48:55.060 --> 1:48:58.560
 in the Palmer Cooling Technology from Coolmit.

1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:01.000
 We will be sure to provide resources to the website

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.020
 so that people can register interest.

1:49:03.020 --> 1:49:08.020
 I do encourage people to play around with, so to speak,

1:49:08.060 --> 1:49:12.600
 the Palmer Cooling Technology that we all have,

1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:15.040
 which are these glabrous surfaces.

1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:16.760
 And I also just want to thank you

1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:18.760
 for taking time out of your busy schedule

1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:20.600
 to share this information.

1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:21.680
 It was fun.

1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:22.840
 It was lots of fun.

1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:24.000
 I certainly learned a lot,

1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.560
 and I know a lot of people are going to learn a lot

1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:27.680
 that's useful to them.

1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:28.680
 Good questions.

1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:30.320
 Well, fabulous answers.

1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.160
 Thank you.

1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:31.980
 Thank you.

1:49:31.980 --> 1:49:33.220
 Thank you for joining for my discussion

1:49:33.220 --> 1:49:35.020
 with Dr. Craig Heller.

 That's a terrific way to support our podcast.

1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:07.080
 In addition, if you're interested in supporting research

1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:08.800
 in the Huberman Lab at Stanford,

1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:13.300
 you can go to hubermanlab.stanford.edu slash giving,

1:50:13.300 --> 1:50:15.560
 and there you can make a tax-deductible donation

1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:17.480
 to support research in my laboratory

1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:20.840
 on stress, human performance, sleep, and trauma,

1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:22.280
 and topics of that sort.

1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:24.760
 If you're not already following us at Huberman Lab

1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:27.600
 on Instagram or Twitter, you're welcome to do so.

1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:31.120
 On Instagram, I do short neuroscience tutorials

1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:33.040
 that are separate from the tutorials

1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:35.480
 that I tend to do on the podcast.

1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:38.040
 Often on this podcast, we discuss supplements.

1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:39.640
 One of the really important things

1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:41.120
 if you're going to take supplements

1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:43.900
 is that the supplements be of the highest quality ingredients

1:50:43.900 --> 1:50:46.320
 and that the amount of those ingredients

1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:48.580
 that's listed on the label actually matches

1:50:48.580 --> 1:50:50.900
 what is in those supplements.

1:50:50.900 --> 1:50:53.280
 We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:50:53.280 --> 1:50:55.760
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:58.920
 in terms of quality and how much of each supplement

1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:00.880
 they put in their products.

1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:02.600
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:05.280
 you can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com

1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:07.840
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:09.600
 and there you can see what I take.

1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:11.920
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements

1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:14.080
 if you enter the Thorne site through that portal.

1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:16.340
 And even if you navigate to other products

1:51:16.340 --> 1:51:18.720
 and other product pages within the Thorne site,

1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:20.780
 you can still get that 20% off.

1:51:20.780 --> 1:51:23.400
 So it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com

1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:26.020
 slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:28.160
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:30.080
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:58.080
 I'll see you next time.
