00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.260
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.260 --> 00:13.020
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.020 --> 00:14.860
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.580
 Today, my guest is Dr. Justin Sonnenberg.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.840
 Dr. Sonnenberg is a professor of microbiology and immunology

00:20.840 --> 00:22.780
 at Stanford School of Medicine,

00:22.780 --> 00:24.500
 and one of the world's leading experts

00:24.500 --> 00:26.380
 on the gut microbiome.

00:26.380 --> 00:29.020
 The gut microbiome is the existence

00:29.020 --> 00:32.700
 of trillions of little microorganisms throughout your gut.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.220
 And by your gut, I don't just mean your stomach,

00:35.220 --> 00:37.580
 I mean your entire digestive tract.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.460
 It turns out we also have a microbiome

00:39.460 --> 00:43.520
 that exists in our nose, in any other location

00:43.520 --> 00:46.680
 in which our body interfaces with the outside world.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.380
 In fact, there's a microbiome on your skin.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.020
 And while it might seem kind of intrusive

00:51.020 --> 00:52.660
 or kind of disgusting to have

00:52.660 --> 00:54.140
 all these little microorganisms,

00:54.140 --> 00:57.420
 they can be immensely beneficial for our health,

00:57.420 --> 01:00.080
 meaning our hormonal health, our brain health,

01:00.080 --> 01:01.820
 and our immune system function.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.460
 Dr. Sonnenberg teaches us about the gut microbiome,

01:04.460 --> 01:05.960
 how it's organized spatially,

01:05.960 --> 01:07.780
 meaning which microbiota live where.

01:07.780 --> 01:09.780
 He teaches us about these incredible things

01:09.780 --> 01:11.380
 called crypts and niches,

01:11.380 --> 01:14.200
 which are little caves within our digestive tract

01:14.200 --> 01:16.440
 that certain microbiota take residence.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.380
 And at that premier real estate,

01:18.380 --> 01:21.000
 they're able to do incredible things to support our health.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.020
 He also talks about the things that we can all do

01:23.020 --> 01:26.540
 to support our microbiome in order for our microbiome

01:26.540 --> 01:29.380
 to support our brain and body health.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.700
 Dr. Sonnenberg co-runs his laboratory

01:31.700 --> 01:34.280
 with his spouse, Dr. Erika Sonnenberg,

01:34.280 --> 01:36.640
 and together they've also written a terrific

01:36.640 --> 01:37.880
 and highly informative book called

01:37.880 --> 01:40.660
 ''The Good Gut, Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood,

01:40.660 --> 01:42.180
 and Your Long-Term Health.''

01:42.180 --> 01:44.140
 Even though that book was written a few years back,

01:44.140 --> 01:46.980
 the information still holds up very nicely.

01:46.980 --> 01:49.560
 And today he also builds on that information,

01:49.560 --> 01:52.340
 informing us about recent studies that for instance,

01:52.340 --> 01:55.300
 point to the important role of fermented foods

01:55.300 --> 01:59.180
 and the role of fiber in supporting a healthy gut microbiome.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.260
 So if you've heard about the gut microbiome,

02:01.260 --> 02:02.340
 or even if you haven't,

02:02.340 --> 02:03.700
 today you're going to hear about it

02:03.700 --> 02:06.140
 from one of the world's leading experts.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.940
 He makes it immensely clear as to what it is,

02:08.940 --> 02:11.180
 how it functions and how to support it

02:11.180 --> 02:13.100
 for your brain and body health.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.300
 During today's discussion,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.100
 we don't just talk about nutrition.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.100
 We also talk about the impact of behaviors

02:19.100 --> 02:20.500
 and the microbiome.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.960
 Behaviors such as who you touch, who you kiss, who you hug,

02:23.960 --> 02:26.920
 whether or not you interact with or avoid animals,

02:26.920 --> 02:28.900
 whether or not those animals belong to you,

02:28.900 --> 02:30.620
 or whether or not they belong to somebody else.

02:30.620 --> 02:32.580
 If all that sounds a little bit bizarre,

02:32.580 --> 02:35.300
 you'll soon understand that your microbiome

02:35.300 --> 02:38.880
 is constantly being modified by the behavioral interactions,

02:38.880 --> 02:42.080
 the nutritional interactions, and indeed your mood

02:42.080 --> 02:45.660
 and internal reactions to the outside world.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.520
 This is an incredible system.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.920
 Everyone has one.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.220
 Everyone should know how it works

02:50.220 --> 02:52.100
 and everyone should know how to optimize it.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.300
 And today you're going to learn all of that

02:54.300 --> 02:55.720
 from Dr. Sonnenberg.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.100
 I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events

02:58.100 --> 03:00.000
 in May, 2022.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.540
 The first live event will take place

03:01.540 --> 03:04.380
 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.020
 The second event will take place in Portland, Oregon

03:07.020 --> 03:08.620
 on May 18th.

03:08.620 --> 03:11.840
 Both are part of a series called the Brain Body Contract.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.980
 For this series, I will discuss science.

03:13.980 --> 03:15.640
 So I will discuss the mechanistic science

03:15.640 --> 03:18.380
 around things like sleep and focus and motivation,

03:18.380 --> 03:20.860
 physical performance, mental health, physical health,

03:20.860 --> 03:22.700
 a large number of topics that I believe

03:22.700 --> 03:23.960
 many people are interested in

03:23.960 --> 03:25.500
 and that certainly are important

03:25.500 --> 03:28.020
 for our health and wellbeing and performance.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.300
 In addition, I will of course describe tools

03:30.300 --> 03:31.500
 and actionable items,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.580
 most of which I have not discussed

03:33.580 --> 03:36.340
 on the Huberman Lab podcast or anywhere else.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.700
 Presale tickets for these two events go live Tuesday,

03:38.700 --> 03:41.220
 March 8th at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.380
 We've made these tickets exclusively available

03:43.380 --> 03:45.220
 to the listeners of the Huberman Lab podcast.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.100
 So they are password protected.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.580
 To find them, you can go to hubermanlab.com slash tour

03:50.580 --> 03:52.380
 and use the code Huberman.

03:52.380 --> 03:55.020
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:55.020 --> 03:57.820
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.760
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:59.760 --> 04:02.340
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:02.340 --> 04:05.060
 and science related tools to the general public.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.140
 In keeping with that theme,

04:06.140 --> 04:08.920
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:08.920 --> 04:13.060
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.460
 I've been taking AG1 since 2012.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.900
 So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:17.900 --> 04:19.420
 The reason I started taking AG1

04:19.420 --> 04:22.460
 and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day

04:22.460 --> 04:24.260
 is that it meets all my basic

04:24.260 --> 04:26.420
 foundational supplementation needs.

04:26.420 --> 04:29.400
 What I mean by that is it covers any vitamin

04:29.400 --> 04:32.260
 and nutritional deficiencies that I might have,

04:32.260 --> 04:34.540
 because I'm trying to be good about my nutrition and diet,

04:34.540 --> 04:37.460
 but I don't always manage to get everything that I need.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.760
 And I'm sure that there are a lot of gaps in there.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.900
 So it covers those gaps.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.260
 It also has probiotics.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.060
 And as you'll learn in today's episode,

04:45.060 --> 04:47.920
 and I've talked about on previous episodes,

04:47.920 --> 04:51.820
 the probiotics are essential for a healthy gut microbiome.

04:51.820 --> 04:55.420
 We need probiotics in order for our microbiome to thrive.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.900
 And our microbiome supports things like gut brain health,

04:57.900 --> 05:00.740
 indeed things like metabolism, mood, hunger.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.740
 It also supports the immune system.

05:02.740 --> 05:05.300
 So you'll learn today your gut microbiome

05:05.300 --> 05:07.600
 actually manufactures neurotransmitters,

05:07.600 --> 05:10.380
 the very chemicals that impact mood and brain function.

05:10.380 --> 05:11.980
 Athletic Greens primes your system

05:11.980 --> 05:14.200
 for a healthy gut microbiome,

05:14.200 --> 05:15.420
 something that can be achieved

05:15.420 --> 05:17.080
 with food and lifestyle factors,

05:17.080 --> 05:18.680
 but is often hard to achieve

05:18.680 --> 05:20.700
 with just food and lifestyle factors.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.160
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:22.160 --> 05:25.000
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:25.000 --> 05:26.340
 to claim a special offer.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.780
 They'll give you five free travel packs

05:27.780 --> 05:29.760
 to make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

05:29.760 --> 05:31.180
 while you're on the road,

05:31.180 --> 05:33.700
 and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.580
 Vitamin D3 has many important biological functions

05:36.580 --> 05:38.380
 that support your immediate and long-term health,

05:38.380 --> 05:40.460
 and K2 as well is very important

05:40.460 --> 05:42.260
 for things like cardiovascular health,

05:42.260 --> 05:43.980
 calcium regulation, and so on.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.800
 Again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

05:46.800 --> 05:47.980
 you can claim the special offer

05:47.980 --> 05:51.360
 of the five free travel packs and the vitamin D3K2.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.800
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.940
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:55.940 --> 05:58.660
 that I believe are of the very highest quality.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.740
 I've spent my lifetime working on the biology

06:00.740 --> 06:01.860
 of the visual system,

06:01.860 --> 06:03.960
 and I can tell you that the biology of the visual system

06:03.960 --> 06:06.200
 has a lot of mechanisms in there,

06:06.200 --> 06:07.140
 so that, for instance,

06:07.140 --> 06:09.980
 if you move from a bright environment to a dim environment,

06:09.980 --> 06:11.740
 your visual system needs to adapt.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.900
 One issue with a lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses

06:13.900 --> 06:15.900
 is you move from one environment to the next,

06:15.900 --> 06:17.820
 and you have to take the sunglasses or eyeglasses off.

06:17.820 --> 06:19.700
 You get a glare or you have to adjust

06:19.700 --> 06:21.680
 because of the way that the lenses are designed.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.460
 With Roka, they've taken the biology

06:23.460 --> 06:24.900
 of the visual system into account,

06:24.900 --> 06:26.500
 and so you never have to take them off and on

06:26.500 --> 06:28.820
 in order to move from one environment to the next.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.620
 They are also designed for movement and athletics,

06:31.620 --> 06:33.980
 or you can wear them for just things like work

06:33.980 --> 06:35.220
 and going out to dinner and so forth.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.280
 They have a terrific aesthetic.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.480
 They're extremely lightweight.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.980
 In fact, I often forget that they're even on my face.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.580
 I wear sunglasses when it's very bright

06:41.580 --> 06:42.900
 and when I'm driving into sunlight,

06:42.900 --> 06:44.780
 I wear readers at night.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.260
 I hardly ever remember that they're on my face.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.660
 They also won't slip off your face

06:48.660 --> 06:51.160
 if you use them when running or cycling.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.300
 The company was developed by two

06:52.300 --> 06:53.980
 all-American swimmers from Stanford.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.580
 So everything about these sunglasses and eyeglasses

06:56.580 --> 06:58.380
 was developed with performance in mind

06:58.380 --> 07:01.060
 in a lot of different situations and scenarios.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.540
 If you'd like to try Roka, you can go to roka.com,

07:03.540 --> 07:06.320
 that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman

07:06.320 --> 07:08.280
 to save 20% off your first order.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.480
 Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,

07:10.480 --> 07:12.600
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.260
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.700
 Helix makes mattresses and pillows

07:17.700 --> 07:20.500
 that are designed for your particular sleep needs.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.820
 What I mean by that is you can go to the Helix site,

07:22.820 --> 07:25.800
 you can take a very brief two or three minute quiz,

07:25.800 --> 07:27.640
 ask questions like, do you sleep on your side,

07:27.640 --> 07:28.680
 your back, your stomach?

07:28.680 --> 07:30.180
 Do you tend to run hot or cold through the night?

07:30.180 --> 07:31.840
 Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.580
 And then they match you to a mattress

07:34.580 --> 07:37.600
 that's designed for your particular sleep needs.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.420
 I matched to the DUSK, D-U-S-K, mattress.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.640
 I like a mattress that's not too firm, not too soft.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.600
 I tend to sleep on my side,

07:43.600 --> 07:45.560
 it's sort of in the like crawling soldier position.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.480
 It seems to be the most common position I sleep in.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.360
 And that really works terrifically well for me.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.640
 But you need to take the quiz

07:51.640 --> 07:54.560
 to see which mattress works best for you.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.260
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

07:56.260 --> 07:58.360
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

07:58.360 --> 07:59.300
 take the two minute quiz,

07:59.300 --> 08:01.360
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.360
 You can figure out how to get your optimal sleep,

08:03.360 --> 08:05.320
 which I've talked about on this podcast

08:05.320 --> 08:06.200
 so many times before.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.280
 Sleep is the foundation of all mental and physical health

08:09.280 --> 08:11.560
 and performance in any aspect of life.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.720
 Sleep is key.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.540
 And the mattress you sleep on is key to the sleep you get.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.580
 After matching you to a customized mattress,

08:17.580 --> 08:20.540
 you can get up to $200 off any mattress order

08:20.540 --> 08:21.940
 and two free pillows.

08:21.940 --> 08:22.780
 Again, if you're interested,

08:22.780 --> 08:25.140
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

08:25.140 --> 08:28.080
 to get up to $200 off and two free pillows.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.660
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg.

08:31.660 --> 08:33.360
 Justin, thanks so much for being here.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.200
 Great to be here.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.160
 Yeah.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.780
 I am a true novice when it comes to the microbiome.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.340
 So I'd like to start off with a really basic question,

08:43.340 --> 08:45.940
 which is what is the microbiome?

08:45.940 --> 08:50.200
 I imagine lots of little bugs running around in my gut,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.940
 and I don't quite like the image of that,

08:52.940 --> 08:57.000
 but I'm aware that our microbiome can be good for us,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.780
 but we can also have an unhealthy microbiome.

08:59.780 --> 09:03.320
 So if I were to look at the microbiome at the scale

09:03.320 --> 09:04.960
 that I could see the meaningful things,

09:04.960 --> 09:08.060
 what would it look like and what's going on in there?

09:08.060 --> 09:11.700
 Yeah, I mean, essentially you're correct.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.060
 I mean, we have all of these little microorganisms

09:14.060 --> 09:15.140
 running around in our gut.

09:15.140 --> 09:15.980
 I think, you know,

09:15.980 --> 09:18.580
 just to start off with clarifying terminology,

09:20.300 --> 09:23.980
 microbiome and microbiota quite often are referred to,

09:23.980 --> 09:27.100
 are used to refer to our microbial community interchangeably

09:27.100 --> 09:29.860
 and I'll probably switch between those two terms today.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.300
 The other important thing to realize

09:31.300 --> 09:35.020
 is that these microbes are not just in our gut,

09:35.020 --> 09:36.380
 but they're all over our body.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.700
 They're in our nose, they're in our mouths,

09:38.700 --> 09:42.100
 they're on our skin and so basically anywhere

09:42.100 --> 09:45.220
 that the environment can get to in our body,

09:45.220 --> 09:47.740
 which includes inside our digestive tract, of course,

09:47.740 --> 09:50.060
 is, you know, colonized with microbes

09:50.060 --> 09:55.060
 and the vast majority of these are in our distal gut

09:55.260 --> 09:58.060
 and in our colon and so this is the gut microbiota

09:58.060 --> 10:02.380
 or gut microbiome and the density

10:02.380 --> 10:04.340
 of this community is astounding.

10:04.340 --> 10:08.620
 I mean, it really is, if you get down to the scale

10:08.620 --> 10:13.180
 of, you know, being able to see individual microbes,

10:13.180 --> 10:15.800
 you know, you start off with a zoomed out view

10:15.800 --> 10:17.400
 and you see something that looks like, you know,

10:17.400 --> 10:21.420
 fecal material that I just inside the gut

10:21.420 --> 10:23.580
 and you zoom in and you start to, you know,

10:23.580 --> 10:26.240
 get to the microscopic level and see the microbes,

10:26.240 --> 10:29.340
 they are just packed, you know, side to side, end to end.

10:29.340 --> 10:32.100
 It's a super dense bacterial community,

10:32.100 --> 10:34.580
 almost like a biofilm, you know,

10:34.580 --> 10:36.620
 something that's just made up of microbes

10:36.620 --> 10:39.140
 to the point where it's thought that, you know,

10:39.140 --> 10:43.840
 around 30% of fecal matter is microbes, 30 to 50%.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.940
 So, you know, it's an incredibly dense microbial community.

10:47.940 --> 10:52.480
 We're talking of, you know, trillions of microbial cells

10:52.480 --> 10:54.580
 and all those microbial cells,

10:54.580 --> 10:58.860
 if you start to get to know them and see who they are,

10:58.860 --> 11:02.100
 break out in the gut probably to hundreds

11:02.100 --> 11:03.860
 to a thousand species,

11:03.860 --> 11:08.020
 depending upon how you define a microbial species.

11:08.020 --> 11:11.620
 And then most of these are bacteria,

11:11.620 --> 11:14.020
 but there are a lot of other life forms there.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.580
 There are archaea, which are little microbes

11:17.580 --> 11:20.940
 that are bacteria-like, but they're different.

11:20.940 --> 11:23.220
 There are eukaryotes.

11:23.220 --> 11:27.180
 So, you know, we commonly think of eukaryotes in the gut

11:27.180 --> 11:30.980
 as, you know, something like a parasite,

11:30.980 --> 11:34.600
 but there are eukaryotes, there are fungi,

11:34.600 --> 11:36.860
 there are also little viruses.

11:36.860 --> 11:41.060
 There are these bacteriophages that infect bacterial cells.

11:41.060 --> 11:44.840
 And so, and those actually outnumber the bacteria

11:44.840 --> 11:46.020
 like 10 to one.

11:46.020 --> 11:50.380
 So they're just everywhere there, they kill bacteria.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.180
 And so there's these really interesting

11:52.180 --> 11:53.980
 predator-prey interactions.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.940
 But overall, it's just this really dense,

11:56.940 --> 11:59.900
 complex, dynamic ecosystem.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.500
 And so, you know, we're talking about the human

12:03.500 --> 12:06.580
 as a single species, but we're also thinking of the human

12:06.580 --> 12:09.140
 as this complex, integrated ecosystem

12:09.140 --> 12:13.060
 of hundreds to thousands of species interacting in concert

12:13.060 --> 12:15.660
 to do all the fantastic things that we know

12:15.660 --> 12:17.100
 happen in the human body.

12:17.100 --> 12:17.940
 Amazing.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.860
 So we've got a lot of cargo.

12:19.860 --> 12:20.940
 Or maybe we're the cargo.

12:20.940 --> 12:25.060
 Yeah, I mean, there have been people that have likened

12:25.060 --> 12:28.140
 humans to just a really elaborate culturing flask

12:28.140 --> 12:32.060
 for microbes and that we've actually been designed

12:32.060 --> 12:37.060
 over the course of evolution, designed to just

12:37.060 --> 12:40.260
 efficiently propagate this microbial culture

12:40.260 --> 12:42.980
 from person to person, from generation to generation.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.140
 So it's a different way of thinking of the human body.

12:45.140 --> 12:45.980
 Interesting.

12:45.980 --> 12:50.980
 I believe that our pH, or the pH of our digestive system

12:52.540 --> 12:55.980
 varies as you descend, as you go from mouth to, you know,

12:55.980 --> 12:57.500
 to throat and stomach.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.900
 And you said that most of the microbiota

12:59.900 --> 13:01.740
 are in the distal colon.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.780
 Are there distinct forms of microbiota all along

13:05.780 --> 13:07.740
 the length of the digestive tract

13:07.740 --> 13:11.540
 and within these other interfaces with the outside world?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.380
 Totally, yeah.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.780
 So it starts like with our teeth and in our mouth

13:14.780 --> 13:18.620
 and saliva, there's oral microbiota.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.260
 These microbial species are very different

13:21.260 --> 13:23.580
 than the ones that you find in the digestive tract.

13:23.580 --> 13:28.580
 They're usually built to deal with oxygen very well.

13:29.220 --> 13:32.620
 They're in an area that is exposed to a lot of oxygen.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.540
 They, of course, see different nutrients than,

13:34.540 --> 13:37.060
 for instance, the colonic bacteria would see.

13:37.060 --> 13:41.620
 And they grow quite often in mats that live on teeth.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.940
 So they're very structured.

13:43.940 --> 13:48.820
 And not moving around a lot.

13:48.820 --> 13:51.180
 So they're very fairly stationary.

13:51.180 --> 13:52.780
 As you move down the digestive tract,

13:52.780 --> 13:55.140
 there are microbes in our esophagus and our stomach,

13:55.140 --> 13:58.540
 but those communities are not very dense

13:58.540 --> 14:00.140
 and actually not very well studied.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.420
 We know of a very, you know,

14:02.420 --> 14:04.380
 there's a very famous stomach bacteria

14:04.380 --> 14:06.380
 known as Helicobacter pylori,

14:06.380 --> 14:09.900
 which can cause stomach ulcers and cause gastric cancer

14:09.900 --> 14:14.420
 in some, you know, less frequent situations.

14:14.420 --> 14:19.420
 But, you know, this is a very different set of microbes.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.580
 They have to be adapted to a different environment

14:23.580 --> 14:26.900
 in the stomach, especially incredibly acidic environment,

14:26.900 --> 14:29.380
 but also very different in terms of their ability

14:29.380 --> 14:31.100
 to interact with other microbes,

14:31.100 --> 14:33.020
 just because the communities are less dense,

14:33.020 --> 14:36.820
 they're less dynamic, there's less nutrients that stay there

14:36.820 --> 14:38.940
 and passage through the community.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.980
 So a lot of times those communities are reliant

14:41.980 --> 14:44.100
 upon nutrients derived from the host,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.460
 as opposed to nutrients derived from our diet.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.140
 As you move down out of the stomach into the small intestine,

14:49.140 --> 14:51.140
 you start to see these communities,

14:51.140 --> 14:54.940
 which are the ones that are becoming more well studied.

14:54.940 --> 14:57.140
 Small intestine is still a bit of a black box

14:57.140 --> 14:58.740
 just because it's hard to access.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.860
 And so there's some really cool technologies out there

15:00.860 --> 15:05.260
 for using, for instance, capsules to do sampling

15:05.260 --> 15:08.100
 as the capsule passes through the digestive tract.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.900
 So that we have a better idea of what's going on

15:09.900 --> 15:11.140
 in the small intestine.

15:11.140 --> 15:14.540
 And then you get to the colon and this is the community

15:14.540 --> 15:17.860
 that's just so incredibly, you know, densely packed,

15:17.860 --> 15:21.340
 doing a ton of, there's a ton of metabolic activity

15:21.340 --> 15:25.420
 happening there and a bunch of interaction with the host.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.700
 And that's the study, that's the community

15:28.700 --> 15:30.540
 that's really the best studied.

15:30.540 --> 15:34.540
 Part of the reason for that is because stool is so easy

15:34.540 --> 15:36.140
 to obtain compared to, for instance,

15:36.140 --> 15:38.340
 something in the stomach or small intestine.

15:38.340 --> 15:41.300
 And that stool is fairly representative.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.020
 We know from studies that have been done

15:43.020 --> 15:44.820
 using colonoscopies and so forth,

15:44.820 --> 15:46.380
 stool is fairly representative

15:46.380 --> 15:48.300
 of what's happening in the colon.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.900
 So dense, super exciting community,

15:50.900 --> 15:53.940
 but also the best studied just because it's the easiest

15:53.940 --> 15:56.580
 to access in the lower digestive tract.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.540
 Very interesting.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.500
 I imagine these microbiota have to get in there

16:01.500 --> 16:02.980
 at some point.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.300
 Are microbiota seen in newborns?

16:05.300 --> 16:08.460
 In other words, where do they come from?

16:08.460 --> 16:12.580
 And dare I ask, what direction do they enter the body?

16:12.580 --> 16:14.780
 Or is it from multiple directions?

16:14.780 --> 16:16.260
 Yeah, yeah, great question.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.060
 So, you know, one of the burning questions

16:18.060 --> 16:19.380
 that we can come back to at the end of this

16:19.380 --> 16:21.100
 is where does our microbiota come from?

16:21.100 --> 16:23.460
 Because it is this kind of, you know,

16:23.460 --> 16:25.180
 existential question in the field,

16:25.180 --> 16:28.380
 like where is this community assembling from?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.940
 And the reason that it's such an interesting question

16:30.940 --> 16:35.180
 is that, you know, a fetus when it's in the womb

16:35.180 --> 16:37.820
 that's actually a sterile environment.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.940
 There have been some studies that have looked at

16:39.940 --> 16:41.900
 whether there are microbes in the womb

16:41.900 --> 16:45.580
 and microbes colonizing the fetus at that point.

16:45.580 --> 16:46.620
 There's some debate about this,

16:46.620 --> 16:48.980
 but overall it looks like that's not a big part

16:48.980 --> 16:51.420
 of the equation of microbial colonization.

16:51.420 --> 16:54.900
 And so each time an infant is born,

16:54.900 --> 16:56.780
 it's this new ecosystem.

16:56.780 --> 16:58.860
 It's like an island rising up out of the ocean

16:58.860 --> 17:00.220
 that has no species on it.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.060
 And suddenly there's this like land rush

17:02.060 --> 17:04.900
 for, you know, this open territory.

17:04.900 --> 17:09.100
 And so the, you know, we know that infants

17:09.100 --> 17:11.180
 go through this really complex process

17:11.180 --> 17:14.460
 of microbiota assembly over the first days,

17:14.460 --> 17:16.420
 weeks, months, years of life.

17:16.420 --> 17:20.700
 And then, you know, you get into switching to solid food,

17:20.700 --> 17:22.820
 two to three years of age.

17:22.820 --> 17:25.340
 There are some changes in childhood,

17:25.340 --> 17:27.540
 adolescents working into adulthood,

17:27.540 --> 17:32.540
 but that first, you know, zero to one year

17:32.540 --> 17:36.500
 is a super dynamic time with really kind of

17:36.500 --> 17:39.420
 stereotypical developmental changes in the gut microbiota

17:39.420 --> 17:43.980
 that appear to have the possibility of going wrong

17:43.980 --> 17:47.980
 and causing problems for infants in some instances.

17:47.980 --> 17:51.660
 But, you know, if you step away from that extreme side

17:51.660 --> 17:53.100
 of things going wrong,

17:53.100 --> 17:56.220
 there also are a lot of different trajectories

17:56.220 --> 17:57.820
 that developmental process can take

17:57.820 --> 18:01.940
 because our microbiota is so malleable and so plastic

18:01.940 --> 18:03.820
 and those trajectories can be affected

18:03.820 --> 18:06.380
 by all sorts of factors in early life.

18:06.380 --> 18:10.220
 So an example is whether an infant is born by C-section

18:10.220 --> 18:11.900
 or born vaginally.

18:11.900 --> 18:15.020
 We know from beautiful work that's been done in the field

18:15.020 --> 18:18.220
 that infants that are born by C-section

18:18.220 --> 18:21.900
 actually have a gut microbiota

18:21.900 --> 18:24.540
 that looks more like human skin

18:24.540 --> 18:28.940
 than it does like either the birth canal,

18:28.940 --> 18:33.940
 the vagina microbiota or the mother's stool microbiota.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.180
 Babies that are born through the birth canal

18:37.180 --> 18:40.940
 have initial colonization of vaginal microbes

18:40.940 --> 18:43.180
 and of stool microbes from their mother.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.820
 And so just these first days,

18:44.820 --> 18:46.140
 whether you're born by C-section

18:46.140 --> 18:48.500
 or through natural childbirth,

18:48.500 --> 18:51.060
 your gut microbiota looks very different.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.060
 And then compound on top of that,

18:53.060 --> 18:55.420
 whether you're breastfed or formula fed,

18:55.420 --> 18:58.460
 whether your family has a pet or doesn't have a pet,

18:58.460 --> 19:01.020
 whether you're exposed to antibiotics,

19:01.020 --> 19:02.500
 there are all these factors

19:02.500 --> 19:05.700
 that really can change that developmental process

19:05.700 --> 19:09.340
 and really change your microbial identity eventually in life.

19:09.340 --> 19:14.340
 The reason that the field is paying really close attention

19:14.700 --> 19:16.620
 to this and studying this right now

19:16.620 --> 19:20.780
 is because we know from animal studies

19:20.780 --> 19:25.660
 that depending upon the microbes that you get early in life,

19:25.660 --> 19:28.700
 you can send the immune system

19:28.700 --> 19:30.940
 or metabolism of an organism

19:30.940 --> 19:33.140
 or other parts of their biology

19:33.140 --> 19:35.500
 in totally different developmental trajectory.

19:35.500 --> 19:39.100
 So what microbes you're colonized with early in life

19:39.100 --> 19:40.460
 can really change your biology.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.740
 And we can come back to that later.

19:41.740 --> 19:45.220
 But getting back to that original question

19:45.220 --> 19:47.380
 of where do your microbes come from,

19:47.380 --> 19:49.260
 you'd think because you're born

19:49.260 --> 19:50.780
 through your mother's birth canal

19:50.780 --> 19:52.540
 or exposed to her skin microbes,

19:52.540 --> 19:55.740
 that a lot of your microbes would come from your mother.

19:55.740 --> 19:57.100
 But it actually turns out

19:57.100 --> 19:59.460
 that we can certainly detect that signal.

19:59.460 --> 20:02.700
 We certainly see maternal microbes in the infant,

20:02.700 --> 20:04.220
 but there are a lot of microbes

20:04.220 --> 20:06.540
 that are coming from other places,

20:06.540 --> 20:09.980
 surfaces, other people, perhaps other caregivers,

20:09.980 --> 20:12.260
 but perhaps strangers as well.

20:12.260 --> 20:16.620
 So we acquire our microbes from a variety of sources.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.500
 The first ones are from our mom

20:18.500 --> 20:20.640
 or from our caregivers from the hospital,

20:20.640 --> 20:22.780
 but then we add to that tremendously

20:22.780 --> 20:24.660
 over the first year or so of life.

20:24.660 --> 20:27.060
 Incredible, you even said pets.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.940
 So if a kid, if there's a dog in the home

20:30.940 --> 20:32.660
 or a parakeet in the home,

20:32.660 --> 20:35.080
 that clearly they have a microbiome also,

20:35.080 --> 20:38.780
 and potentially the child is deriving microbiota species

20:38.780 --> 20:40.660
 from those pets, correct?

20:40.660 --> 20:41.500
 Exactly, yeah.

20:41.500 --> 20:46.140
 And so the best studies that have been done

20:46.140 --> 20:48.860
 have just looked at pets in the household as a factor

20:48.860 --> 20:52.820
 and whether that changes the group of infants

20:52.820 --> 20:54.980
 that have a pet to look slightly different

20:54.980 --> 20:57.500
 than the group of infants that don't have a pet.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.340
 And then the question is,

20:58.340 --> 21:01.280
 what is the pet doing to change those microbes?

21:01.280 --> 21:03.940
 And some of it is probably actually contributing

21:03.940 --> 21:06.100
 direct members of the microbiota.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.700
 Actually, I have a dog,

21:08.700 --> 21:11.500
 that dog occasionally will lick my mouth

21:11.500 --> 21:13.540
 without me like paying attention,

21:13.540 --> 21:16.160
 and that's probably introducing microbes.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.180
 We also know that pets are down in the dirt,

21:20.180 --> 21:23.740
 they're outside, they're being exposed

21:23.740 --> 21:25.720
 to a lot of environmental microbes.

21:25.720 --> 21:30.100
 And so just pets serving as a conduit

21:30.100 --> 21:32.100
 for a bunch of microbes

21:32.100 --> 21:34.940
 that we wouldn't otherwise come in contact with

21:34.940 --> 21:36.780
 is a possibility as well.

21:36.780 --> 21:38.960
 I'll show you what, we will return to pets,

21:38.960 --> 21:41.300
 and in particular, your dog, an amazing dog, by the way.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.260
 I met your dog just the other day,

21:43.260 --> 21:44.460
 and I had to force myself,

21:44.460 --> 21:47.260
 I had to pry myself away from, it's a Havanese, right?

21:47.260 --> 21:48.900
 Incredible, what is your dog's name?

21:48.900 --> 21:50.700
 Louis, Louis Pasteur.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.420
 Louis Pasteur, I don't know how appropriate.

21:53.420 --> 21:55.980
 Amazing dog, what a personality on that dog.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.500
 The issue that I think a lot of people

22:00.500 --> 22:02.820
 are probably wondering is,

22:02.820 --> 22:04.820
 what is a healthy microbiome?

22:04.820 --> 22:06.820
 And what is it supporting?

22:06.820 --> 22:10.000
 We hear that you need a healthy microbiome

22:10.000 --> 22:11.940
 to support the immune system or metabolism,

22:11.940 --> 22:14.060
 or even the gut brain axis.

22:14.060 --> 22:17.700
 How do we define a healthy versus a unhealthy microbiome?

22:17.700 --> 22:19.860
 Some people might know the unhealthy microbiome

22:19.860 --> 22:23.660
 as dysbiosis is the word that I encounter in the literature.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.540
 But given that there are so many species of microbiota,

22:26.540 --> 22:28.640
 and given that I think we probably each have

22:28.640 --> 22:31.220
 a signature pattern of microbiota,

22:31.220 --> 22:34.040
 how do we define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota?

22:34.040 --> 22:36.320
 Is there a test for this?

22:36.320 --> 22:39.380
 Later, we'll talk about technologies for testing microbiota.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.040
 There are a lot of companies now,

22:41.040 --> 22:44.380
 a lot of people sending stool samples in the mail.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.180
 Never look at the postal service the same way again,

22:46.180 --> 22:49.380
 but it's out there and it's getting analyzed.

22:49.380 --> 22:50.820
 So how should I think about this?

22:50.820 --> 22:52.900
 I can think about things like heart rate,

22:52.900 --> 22:57.900
 heart rate variability, BMI, all sorts of metrics of health.

22:57.980 --> 22:59.740
 How should I think about the microbiota?

22:59.740 --> 23:02.060
 How do I know if my microbiome is healthy or unhealthy?

23:02.060 --> 23:05.300
 Yeah, it's a million dollar question right now in the field.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.220
 And there's a lot of different ways of thinking about that.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.340
 And I can talk about some of those,

23:08.340 --> 23:13.340
 but I would say that there are sessions at conferences,

23:13.420 --> 23:15.300
 there are review articles being commissioned.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.460
 There are all sorts of kind of thought pieces

23:17.460 --> 23:19.980
 about this right now, like what is a healthy microbiota?

23:19.980 --> 23:22.260
 What are the features that define it?

23:22.260 --> 23:25.020
 And I think before diving into this,

23:25.020 --> 23:30.020
 the important thing to realize is it's a complex topic.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.260
 Context matters a lot.

23:33.260 --> 23:35.460
 What's healthy for one person or one population

23:35.460 --> 23:38.760
 may not be healthy for another person or population.

23:38.760 --> 23:43.580
 And the microbiota is malleable.

23:43.580 --> 23:48.580
 It's plastic, it changes our human biology,

23:48.580 --> 23:52.740
 which I think is how we think about health quite often,

23:52.740 --> 23:56.380
 BMI and longevity, reproductive success,

23:56.380 --> 23:57.780
 however you wanna define it.

23:59.380 --> 24:04.380
 It certainly can accommodate a variety of configurations

24:04.380 --> 24:05.880
 of gut microbiota.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.280
 And we don't have, you know,

24:08.280 --> 24:11.960
 it's really hard to untangle all of the different factors

24:11.960 --> 24:14.000
 of what could be very healthy

24:14.000 --> 24:16.200
 versus a little bit less healthy.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.720
 So I will say that there's no single answer to this,

24:18.720 --> 24:20.880
 but there's some really important considerations.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.760
 And perhaps the best way to start talking about this

24:23.760 --> 24:27.160
 is to go back to the inception

24:27.160 --> 24:28.640
 of the Human Microbiome Project,

24:28.640 --> 24:31.380
 which was this program that NIH started.

24:31.380 --> 24:35.000
 They invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
 for really propelling the field of gut microbiome research.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.800
 It was becoming evident at that point

24:43.800 --> 24:46.360
 that this was not just a curiosity of human biology,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.600
 that it was probably really important for our health.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.640
 And they had all this wonderful sequencing technology

24:51.640 --> 24:54.340
 from the Human Genome Sequencing Project.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.640
 And with the human genome complete at that point,

24:56.640 --> 24:58.160
 they started turning that technology

24:58.160 --> 24:59.600
 to sequencing our gut microbes.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.880
 And, you know, it's important to contextualize

25:01.880 --> 25:05.520
 the amount of information that they're trying to document.

25:05.520 --> 25:09.120
 The, you know, collective genome of our gut microbes

25:09.120 --> 25:13.460
 is on the order of 100 to 500 times larger

25:13.460 --> 25:15.040
 than our human genome.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.440
 So it's just in terms of the number of genes.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.020
 So it's just this vast number of genes.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.200
 And then if you start getting

25:21.200 --> 25:22.680
 into some of the fine variation,

25:22.680 --> 25:24.920
 it's, you know, scales by 10 to 100 fold.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.200
 So really a huge amount of information

25:27.200 --> 25:28.200
 they're trying to document.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.920
 And so it was a wonderful investment

25:31.920 --> 25:34.880
 and it continues to pay dividends to this day.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.680
 But one of their goals of that project

25:36.680 --> 25:39.640
 was to try to define what a healthy microbiome is

25:39.640 --> 25:42.200
 versus a diseased microbiome in different contexts.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.720
 And so they started enrolling a bunch of healthy people

25:45.720 --> 25:47.100
 and a bunch of people with, for instance,

25:47.100 --> 25:49.460
 inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases.

25:49.460 --> 25:53.200
 And the idea was let's document those microbiomes,

25:53.200 --> 25:55.400
 what microbes are there, what genes are there.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.360
 And then we can start to get a sense of

25:57.360 --> 26:00.000
 what are the commonalities of the healthy people

26:00.000 --> 26:04.880
 and how can that go wrong in these different disease states.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.880
 And, you know, there were some answers from that,

26:10.560 --> 26:13.440
 but through those studies,

26:13.440 --> 26:14.960
 we really started to get the image

26:14.960 --> 26:17.600
 that there is this tremendous individuality

26:17.600 --> 26:18.980
 in the gut microbiome.

26:18.980 --> 26:23.980
 And so it's really hard to start drawing, you know,

26:23.980 --> 26:28.420
 conclusions after initial pass of that project

26:28.420 --> 26:30.580
 of what is a healthy microbiome.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.700
 But the other thing that we started to realize

26:32.700 --> 26:35.740
 at the same time, there were studies going on

26:35.740 --> 26:39.440
 documenting the gut microbiome of traditional populations

26:39.440 --> 26:41.660
 of humans, hunter-gatherers,

26:41.660 --> 26:43.980
 rural agricultural populations.

26:43.980 --> 26:46.880
 And those studies were really mind blowing

26:46.880 --> 26:48.560
 from the perspective of, you know,

26:48.560 --> 26:49.920
 all these people are healthy,

26:49.920 --> 26:52.460
 they're living very different lifestyles

26:52.460 --> 26:54.660
 and their microbiome doesn't look anything

26:54.660 --> 26:57.580
 like a healthy American microbiome.

26:57.580 --> 27:00.820
 So does that mean that the healthy American microbiome

27:00.820 --> 27:05.580
 is healthy, but only in the context of living

27:05.580 --> 27:09.080
 in the United States and consuming what's consumed here?

27:09.080 --> 27:12.500
 Or is it that there is a superior microbiome signature

27:12.500 --> 27:14.900
 somewhere in our history or currently in the world?

27:14.900 --> 27:17.500
 Yeah, you know, I think that's kind of

27:17.500 --> 27:19.540
 a big question right now.

27:19.540 --> 27:23.780
 I think, you know, there's a great quote from Dabchansky

27:23.780 --> 27:25.660
 that says, nothing in biology makes sense

27:25.660 --> 27:27.540
 except in the light of evolution.

27:27.540 --> 27:30.480
 And, you know, these traditional populations

27:30.480 --> 27:33.980
 are all modern people living on the planet now,

27:33.980 --> 27:37.440
 but their lifestyle does represent, you know,

27:37.440 --> 27:41.980
 the closest approximation to how our ancestors,

27:41.980 --> 27:43.340
 early humans lived.

27:43.340 --> 27:47.460
 And so those microbiomes, and now we know from sequencing

27:47.460 --> 27:50.380
 of paleo feces, the microbiome of these traditional

27:50.380 --> 27:53.660
 populations is representative, more representative

27:53.660 --> 27:56.540
 of the microbiome that we evolved with,

27:56.540 --> 27:59.420
 that potentially shaped our human genome.

27:59.420 --> 28:04.420
 And so one possibility is that in the industrialized world,

28:05.300 --> 28:08.660
 we have a different microbiome from traditional populations

28:08.660 --> 28:10.500
 and that microbiome is well adapted

28:10.500 --> 28:13.040
 to our current lifestyle and therefore healthy

28:13.040 --> 28:15.060
 in the context of an industrialized society.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.060
 And there probably are elements of that that are true.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.740
 But another possibility is that this is a microbiome

28:20.740 --> 28:24.180
 that's gone off the rails, that it is, you know,

28:24.180 --> 28:26.740
 deteriorating in the face of antibiotic use

28:26.740 --> 28:31.740
 and all the problems associated with industrialized diet,

28:32.420 --> 28:37.420
 Western diet, and that even though the human microbiome

28:38.660 --> 28:42.540
 project documented the microbiome of healthy people,

28:42.540 --> 28:45.340
 healthy Americans, that what they really may have been

28:45.340 --> 28:48.380
 documenting there is a perturbed microbiota

28:48.380 --> 28:51.740
 that's really predisposing people to a variety

28:51.740 --> 28:54.900
 of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.140
 It reminds me of the, as a neurobiologist,

28:58.140 --> 29:01.460
 was weaned in the landscape of so-called critical periods

29:01.460 --> 29:06.460
 where early life environment very strongly shapes the brain.

29:07.060 --> 29:09.280
 And so many studies were done on animals raised

29:09.280 --> 29:11.540
 in traditional cages with a water bottle and some food,

29:11.540 --> 29:14.180
 maybe a few other animals of the same species.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.980
 And then people came along and said,

29:15.980 --> 29:18.520
 wait, normally these species in the wild would have things

29:18.520 --> 29:20.620
 like things to climb over and things to go through

29:20.620 --> 29:22.720
 and you provide those very basic elements

29:22.720 --> 29:25.080
 and all of a sudden the architecture of neural circuits

29:25.080 --> 29:26.300
 looks very different and you realize

29:26.300 --> 29:29.100
 that you were studying a deprived condition.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.700
 And earlier you actually referred to,

29:30.700 --> 29:33.420
 if I understood correctly, to critical periods

29:33.420 --> 29:35.500
 for gut microbiome development.

29:36.420 --> 29:39.700
 Is it fair to say that there are critical periods?

29:39.700 --> 29:42.140
 Meaning if my, let's say my, let's aim it at me,

29:42.140 --> 29:46.420
 if my gut microbiome was dysbiotic,

29:46.420 --> 29:49.220
 it was off early in life,

29:49.220 --> 29:52.620
 can I rescue that through proper conditions and exercise?

29:52.620 --> 29:55.340
 Or is there some sort of fixed pattern

29:55.340 --> 29:57.220
 that's going to be hard for me to escape from?

29:57.220 --> 30:00.860
 Yeah, there's a big field that's emerging now

30:00.860 --> 30:05.340
 that we refer to as kind of reprogramming the gut microbiome.

30:05.340 --> 30:09.140
 And I think if we want to conceptualize humans

30:09.140 --> 30:12.580
 as this aggregate human microbial biology,

30:14.580 --> 30:16.020
 most people have heard of CRISPR

30:16.020 --> 30:19.140
 and the ability to potentially change our human genome

30:19.140 --> 30:21.980
 in ways that correct genetic problems.

30:23.220 --> 30:26.040
 That's a wonderful technology

30:26.040 --> 30:29.060
 and has kind of put on the table,

30:29.060 --> 30:31.300
 genetic engineering for curing disease,

30:31.300 --> 30:35.000
 but it's much easier to change gut microbes for a problem

30:35.000 --> 30:38.980
 just because that community is malleable.

30:38.980 --> 30:43.380
 The issue that I think we're seeing in the field

30:43.380 --> 30:47.100
 is that microbiomes quite often,

30:47.100 --> 30:50.860
 whether they're diseased or healthy, exist in stable states.

30:50.860 --> 30:55.740
 They kind of tend towards this well that has gravity to it,

30:55.740 --> 30:58.020
 in a way, biological gravity,

30:58.020 --> 31:01.500
 where it's really hard to dislodge that community

31:01.500 --> 31:02.660
 from that state.

31:02.660 --> 31:06.500
 So even individuals, for instance, that get antibiotics,

31:06.500 --> 31:09.140
 you take oral antibiotics,

31:09.140 --> 31:11.120
 the community takes this huge hit.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.380
 We know that a bunch of microbes die,

31:13.380 --> 31:15.400
 the composition changes,

31:15.400 --> 31:18.300
 and that represents a period of vulnerability

31:18.300 --> 31:20.220
 where pathogens can come in and take over

31:20.220 --> 31:21.060
 and cause disease.

31:21.060 --> 31:22.860
 But if that doesn't happen,

31:22.860 --> 31:25.500
 the microbiota kind of works its way back

31:25.500 --> 31:27.500
 to something that is not exactly like,

31:27.500 --> 31:31.140
 but similar to the pre-antibiotic treatment.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.220
 We know with dietary perturbations,

31:33.220 --> 31:36.980
 quite often you'll see a really rapid change

31:36.980 --> 31:38.260
 to the gut microbiome.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.980
 And then it's almost like a memory

31:39.980 --> 31:43.580
 where it snaps back to something that's very similar

31:43.580 --> 31:44.480
 to the original state,

31:44.480 --> 31:46.860
 even though the diet remains different.

31:46.860 --> 31:48.780
 And so there's this incredible,

31:48.780 --> 31:51.700
 what we refer to as resilience of the gut microbiome

31:51.700 --> 31:53.980
 and resistance to change,

31:53.980 --> 31:58.000
 or at least resistance to establishing a new stable state.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.660
 So that doesn't mean it's hopeless

31:59.660 --> 32:04.140
 to change an unhealthy microbiome to a healthy microbiome,

32:04.140 --> 32:06.340
 but it does mean that we need to think carefully

32:06.340 --> 32:10.140
 about restructuring these communities

32:10.140 --> 32:13.300
 in ways where we can achieve a new stable state

32:13.300 --> 32:15.840
 that will resist the microbial community

32:15.840 --> 32:18.160
 getting pulled back to that original state.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.740
 And one of the really kind of simplest

32:21.740 --> 32:25.340
 and nicest examples of this is an experiment

32:25.340 --> 32:29.580
 that we performed with mice

32:29.580 --> 32:33.060
 where we were feeding mice a normal mouse diet,

32:33.060 --> 32:35.460
 a lot of nutrients there for the gut microbiota,

32:35.460 --> 32:37.180
 things like dietary fiber,

32:37.180 --> 32:39.900
 and we switched those mice,

32:39.900 --> 32:42.480
 half the mice, to a low fiber diet.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.180
 And we were basically asking the question that

32:45.180 --> 32:47.700
 if you switch to kind of a Western-like diet,

32:47.700 --> 32:49.900
 a low fiber, higher fat diet,

32:49.900 --> 32:51.700
 what happens to the gut microbiota?

32:51.700 --> 32:54.900
 And we saw the microbiota change, it lost diversity.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.980
 It was very similar to what we see

32:56.980 --> 32:59.780
 in the difference between industrialized

32:59.780 --> 33:01.340
 and traditional populations.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.980
 But when we brought back a healthy diet,

33:03.980 --> 33:05.940
 a lot of the microbes returned.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.340
 You know, it was fairly,

33:07.340 --> 33:09.340
 you know, there was this kind of memory

33:09.340 --> 33:12.420
 where it went back to very similar to its original state.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.940
 The difference is that when we put the mice

33:14.940 --> 33:17.300
 on a low fiber, high fat diet,

33:17.300 --> 33:21.140
 and then kept them on that for multiple generations,

33:21.140 --> 33:23.560
 we saw this progressive deterioration

33:23.560 --> 33:25.200
 over the course of generations

33:25.200 --> 33:27.060
 where by the fourth generation,

33:27.060 --> 33:30.660
 the gut microbiome was a fraction

33:30.660 --> 33:31.700
 of what it originally was.

33:31.700 --> 33:35.060
 Let's say 30% of the species only remained,

33:35.060 --> 33:38.200
 something like 70% of the species had gone extinct

33:38.200 --> 33:40.420
 or appeared to have gone extinct.

33:40.420 --> 33:43.540
 We then put those mice back onto a high fiber diet

33:43.540 --> 33:45.360
 and we didn't see recovery.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.020
 So in that case, it's a situation

33:48.020 --> 33:50.580
 where a new stable state has been achieved.

33:50.580 --> 33:52.440
 In that case, it's probably because those mice

33:52.440 --> 33:56.300
 don't actually have access to the microbes they've lost.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.560
 And we actually know that we did the control experiment

33:59.560 --> 34:02.720
 of mice on a high fiber diet for four generations.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.280
 They maintain all their microbes.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.740
 If we take those fourth generation mice

34:06.740 --> 34:09.540
 with all the diversity and do a fecal transplant

34:09.540 --> 34:11.980
 into the mice that had lost their microbes,

34:11.980 --> 34:14.340
 but had been returned to a high fiber diet,

34:14.340 --> 34:16.580
 all of the diversity was reconstituted.

34:16.580 --> 34:19.520
 So it was, you know, so your question of like,

34:19.520 --> 34:21.600
 how do we establish new stable states?

34:21.600 --> 34:23.380
 How do we get back to a healthy microbiota?

34:23.380 --> 34:25.560
 If we have taken a lot of antibiotics

34:25.560 --> 34:27.460
 or have a deteriorated microbiota,

34:27.460 --> 34:29.940
 it's probably a combination of having access

34:29.940 --> 34:31.440
 to the right microbes.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.900
 And we can talk about what that access looks like.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.560
 It may look like therapeutics in the future.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.840
 There are a lot of companies working on creating cocktails

34:37.840 --> 34:40.200
 of healthy microbes, but it'll be a combination

34:40.200 --> 34:42.540
 of access to the right microbes

34:42.540 --> 34:46.940
 and nourishing those microbes with the proper diet.

34:46.940 --> 34:47.780
 Very interesting.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.620
 This multi-generational study reminds me of something

34:49.620 --> 34:51.780
 that I was told early in my training,

34:51.780 --> 34:56.220
 which was that it takes a long time for a trait to evolve,

34:56.220 --> 34:59.400
 but not a long time for traits to devolve.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.240
 Exactly.

35:00.240 --> 35:04.340
 Which generally is true of human behavior too,

35:04.340 --> 35:06.580
 although it depends.

35:06.580 --> 35:07.900
 We can all do better nonetheless.

35:07.900 --> 35:08.740
 Very interesting.

35:08.740 --> 35:13.380
 So I have a puzzle or a bit of a conundrum

35:14.300 --> 35:17.540
 around this notion of species of microbiota.

35:17.540 --> 35:21.900
 So if the pH, if the acidity differs

35:21.900 --> 35:23.780
 along the digestive tract,

35:23.780 --> 35:26.100
 but is more or less fixed for a given location, right?

35:26.100 --> 35:27.300
 I mean, unless something is really off,

35:27.300 --> 35:29.900
 the pH of the stomach is within a particular range

35:29.900 --> 35:32.540
 and the intestine and so forth.

35:32.540 --> 35:36.980
 And certain microbiota thrive at a given station,

35:36.980 --> 35:39.540
 a given location along the digestive tract.

35:39.540 --> 35:42.680
 And the pH is sort of fixed more or less.

35:43.580 --> 35:44.420
 I'm trying to figure out

35:44.420 --> 35:47.900
 what is allowing certain microbiota

35:47.900 --> 35:49.940
 to stay in a given location?

35:49.940 --> 35:51.660
 Why don't they migrate up or down?

35:51.660 --> 35:52.960
 So are they pH sensitive?

35:52.960 --> 35:56.260
 And that's what they're selecting for along the tract.

35:56.260 --> 36:01.060
 And I'm also trying to figure out how these changes in food

36:01.060 --> 36:03.400
 so robustly change the microbiome.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.580
 The way you describe it almost makes it sound like food

36:05.580 --> 36:07.800
 is the variable that's going to dictate

36:07.800 --> 36:09.740
 the quality of the microbiome.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.860
 Although I'm sure there are other factors as well.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.420
 And then in the back of my mind,

36:13.420 --> 36:15.220
 I don't know that I want to ask this question,

36:15.220 --> 36:16.660
 but I really want to ask this question,

36:16.660 --> 36:19.740
 which is where are they in there exactly?

36:19.740 --> 36:22.580
 And why don't they all get flushed out, right?

36:22.580 --> 36:26.580
 If 30% of fecal matter is microbiota,

36:27.460 --> 36:29.340
 then where are they living?

36:29.340 --> 36:32.580
 Are they along the lining

36:32.580 --> 36:34.980
 and the little microvilli of the intestine?

36:34.980 --> 36:38.140
 And what are they attaching to and interacting with?

36:38.140 --> 36:40.660
 We know there are neurons in there,

36:40.660 --> 36:41.900
 especially within the stomach.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.300
 There's a lot of work now being done on the gut neurons

36:45.300 --> 36:47.340
 and how they signal to the brain and so forth.

36:47.340 --> 36:51.680
 But who are they talking to in terms of the host cells?

36:51.680 --> 36:54.060
 And because if it's just from food,

36:54.060 --> 36:55.100
 I imagine that they're in there

36:55.100 --> 36:57.340
 having their good time or not.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.940
 And then some are getting flushed out or not,

36:59.940 --> 37:01.980
 but how do they actually stay in there?

37:01.980 --> 37:03.420
 Who are they attaching to?

37:03.420 --> 37:04.540
 What are they talking about?

37:04.540 --> 37:06.500
 What are they doing for fun and so forth?

37:06.500 --> 37:08.300
 Yeah, yeah, super interesting.

37:08.300 --> 37:11.780
 So I'll come back to the attachment question

37:11.780 --> 37:13.740
 and kind of like why they don't get washed out

37:13.740 --> 37:15.820
 because this is a super fascinating question.

37:15.820 --> 37:19.140
 And I think your initial point

37:19.140 --> 37:22.460
 of like the kind of regional differences

37:22.460 --> 37:24.660
 in what's happening in terms of physiology,

37:24.660 --> 37:26.800
 biochemistry along the length of the gut

37:26.800 --> 37:27.640
 is really interesting.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.300
 There certainly is a pH gradient

37:29.300 --> 37:30.580
 along the length of the gut.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.700
 There is actually bicarbonate that's secreted

37:33.700 --> 37:37.380
 into the small intestine to try to neutralize stomach acid.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.940
 There also is bile that's secreted.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.540
 That creates a different chemical environment

37:42.540 --> 37:44.660
 and there are bile-loving bacteria

37:44.660 --> 37:47.060
 that kind of live in that region of the gut.

37:47.060 --> 37:51.220
 And then there is a nutrient gradient

37:51.220 --> 37:54.060
 just because as food leaves the stomach,

37:55.300 --> 37:58.420
 a lot of the simple nutrients are absorbed.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.900
 And so you might see microbes in the small intestine,

38:01.900 --> 38:04.760
 for instance, that are better at consuming simple sugars,

38:04.760 --> 38:07.260
 but you won't find many microbes in the colon like that

38:07.260 --> 38:08.460
 because all the simple sugars

38:08.460 --> 38:10.660
 have been depleted at that point.

38:10.660 --> 38:13.820
 And then the immune system is a big factor as well.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.400
 And the immune system is incredibly active

38:16.400 --> 38:18.300
 in the small intestine.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.580
 The small intestine is this really interesting challenge

38:20.580 --> 38:22.860
 for the host because it's a tissue that's been,

38:22.860 --> 38:25.100
 its purpose is mainly absorptive.

38:25.100 --> 38:30.100
 And so there has to be flow of a lot of things,

38:30.420 --> 38:35.100
 a lot of nutrients from the luminal contents

38:35.100 --> 38:36.700
 into host cells.

38:36.700 --> 38:40.700
 And so that means the barrier can't be as fortified.

38:40.700 --> 38:44.340
 And so the immune system is incredibly active

38:44.340 --> 38:46.260
 in the small intestine to make sure

38:46.260 --> 38:48.420
 that microbes aren't getting so close.

38:48.420 --> 38:49.900
 And if they are getting close,

38:49.900 --> 38:51.860
 there's a response to them to put them back

38:51.860 --> 38:53.680
 in their right location.

38:53.680 --> 38:58.680
 So there's, and then along this whole kind of architecture

38:59.740 --> 39:04.000
 of the gut, there's the longitudinal gradients,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.120
 things like pH and so forth.

39:06.120 --> 39:09.500
 And I should say that pH starts to drop again in the colon

39:09.500 --> 39:12.220
 because a lot of those microbes are fermenting things

39:12.220 --> 39:13.840
 and producing acids.

39:13.840 --> 39:17.940
 And so you actually end up with the pH starting to drop,

39:17.940 --> 39:20.300
 not as low as the stomach, but starting to drop again

39:20.300 --> 39:23.840
 if there's a lot of fermentation happening in the colon.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.740
 In addition, you also have a gradient

39:25.740 --> 39:28.740
 from the host surface epithelium

39:28.740 --> 39:31.660
 out to the middle of the gut.

39:31.660 --> 39:36.660
 And that is likely the key for what is retained in the gut

39:38.180 --> 39:41.160
 and how the community isn't washed out.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.620
 So lining the gut, we have epithelial cells

39:44.620 --> 39:47.320
 in the small intestine, they're largely absorptive.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.780
 In the colon, there's a lot of mucus production.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.620
 And we also see this in the small intestine.

39:53.620 --> 39:58.460
 And this mucus lining is this substance that we secrete,

39:58.460 --> 40:01.020
 largely made of carbohydrate actually.

40:01.020 --> 40:04.940
 And the purpose of that is to keep microbes

40:04.940 --> 40:09.500
 in the right spot and to allow nutrients and water

40:09.500 --> 40:12.700
 to be absorbed in the small intestine and large intestine.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.580
 And so it's this mesh work

40:14.580 --> 40:17.180
 that is supposed to keep out large things like bacteria

40:17.180 --> 40:19.720
 and lead in small things like nutrients.

40:20.840 --> 40:25.840
 That mucus layer, it turns over more slowly

40:26.380 --> 40:29.460
 than the luminal contents passing by.

40:29.460 --> 40:34.120
 And so if a microbe learns to hold on to that mucus layer,

40:34.120 --> 40:39.120
 it can actually resist the flow of the contents of the gut.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.360
 And so there's many microbes in the gut

40:42.360 --> 40:44.580
 that are not just good at attaching to mucus,

40:44.580 --> 40:48.360
 but also good at nibbling on it, at eating it.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.980
 And there are these bacteria like acromancea,

40:50.980 --> 40:54.860
 muciniphila, mucus-loving, one of its main things it does

40:54.860 --> 40:58.580
 is actually eat mucus in the gut, that's its lifestyle.

40:58.580 --> 41:03.580
 And so there's an incredible gradient of activity

41:04.060 --> 41:05.780
 from the host tissue working your way

41:05.780 --> 41:07.260
 out to the middle of the gut.

41:07.260 --> 41:08.940
 What's amazing is some microbes

41:08.940 --> 41:11.100
 actually do penetrate past the mucus

41:11.100 --> 41:12.980
 and there are these invaginations

41:12.980 --> 41:15.200
 in the intestine known as crypts,

41:15.200 --> 41:17.520
 actually where the stem cells live,

41:17.520 --> 41:18.980
 that produce the epithelium.

41:18.980 --> 41:20.780
 And there are microbial communities

41:20.780 --> 41:22.780
 that can form in those crypts.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.300
 And we don't know completely what their function is,

41:25.300 --> 41:27.860
 but we've done some studies that appear to indicate

41:27.860 --> 41:30.620
 that if you can localize to a crypt,

41:30.620 --> 41:33.420
 you've hit the jackpot as a microbe

41:33.420 --> 41:36.460
 for being able to maintain dominance in the gut.

41:36.460 --> 41:40.380
 So if you sit in the crypt and something similar to you,

41:40.380 --> 41:42.920
 another microbe that's similar to you comes into the gut,

41:42.920 --> 41:45.400
 you can actually exclude that microbe.

41:45.400 --> 41:49.380
 And the thinking is that it can't find a spot

41:49.380 --> 41:52.080
 to resist being washed out of the gut.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.080
 So there probably are these little niches

41:54.080 --> 41:55.940
 close to host tissue in the mucus

41:55.940 --> 41:59.380
 that are absolutely essential for resisting

41:59.380 --> 42:02.860
 getting washed out with the flow of all the contents.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.480
 Incredible.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.600
 That raises a question about two things

42:06.600 --> 42:08.940
 that are reasonably popular.

42:08.940 --> 42:13.060
 One is this notion of cleanses from either direction.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.660
 People will consume things by mouth

42:14.660 --> 42:17.340
 to try and cleanse their digestive tract.

42:17.340 --> 42:19.060
 There's a long history of this.

42:19.060 --> 42:20.260
 I'm not recommending this.

42:20.260 --> 42:21.380
 There are differing opinions

42:21.380 --> 42:23.020
 on whether or not this is good or bad.

42:23.020 --> 42:26.900
 And the other is fasting or time restricted feeding.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.780
 The reason I ask about time restricted feeding

42:29.780 --> 42:31.260
 is my understanding is that

42:31.260 --> 42:33.980
 after a prolonged period of fasting,

42:33.980 --> 42:38.300
 there's some auto absorption or digestion

42:38.300 --> 42:41.860
 of one's own digestive tract that then gets renewed.

42:41.860 --> 42:42.700
 In other words,

42:42.700 --> 42:44.960
 your intestine and stomach start eating its own lining

42:44.960 --> 42:47.100
 to some extent in the absence of food.

42:47.100 --> 42:49.220
 So what do we know about cleanses?

42:49.220 --> 42:50.460
 Oh, and then I suppose there's cleanses

42:50.460 --> 42:51.860
 from the other direction too, right?

42:51.860 --> 42:53.260
 Which are less popular,

42:53.260 --> 42:55.780
 but I've never run the statistics,

42:55.780 --> 42:59.140
 but certainly exist out there.

43:00.340 --> 43:03.720
 What's the idea about cleanses and fasting

43:03.720 --> 43:05.020
 as it relates to the health

43:05.020 --> 43:07.500
 or the dysbiosis of the microbiota?

43:07.500 --> 43:09.060
 Yeah, you know, there hasn't been

43:09.060 --> 43:11.380
 a lot of high quality science in this area.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.860
 And so it's really hard to conclude

43:12.860 --> 43:15.780
 whether these are good for health or bad for health.

43:15.780 --> 43:17.500
 I think the fasting,

43:19.020 --> 43:21.460
 we're in a really interesting situation

43:21.460 --> 43:23.080
 in the industrialized world

43:23.080 --> 43:24.700
 because we have so many problems

43:24.700 --> 43:26.480
 associated with our digestive tract.

43:26.480 --> 43:30.100
 And that probably has to do with our highly processed diet

43:30.100 --> 43:31.820
 and perhaps having a microbiota

43:31.820 --> 43:33.980
 that's fairly perturbed as well.

43:33.980 --> 43:35.780
 And so, you know,

43:37.620 --> 43:42.620
 whether doing things like this are good or bad,

43:44.820 --> 43:46.940
 it's really hard to define

43:46.940 --> 43:50.380
 because we may be starting off in a fairly bad state anyway.

43:50.380 --> 43:52.340
 There are so many diseases

43:52.340 --> 43:53.260
 that we're dealing with,

43:53.260 --> 43:56.100
 metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,

43:56.100 --> 44:00.380
 that just put a massive portion of the population

44:00.380 --> 44:02.600
 in a very different category

44:02.600 --> 44:04.200
 than people that are thinking about

44:04.200 --> 44:05.480
 how do I maintain health?

44:05.480 --> 44:07.780
 How do I live a long life

44:07.780 --> 44:10.000
 from starting off in what we consider

44:10.000 --> 44:11.500
 a fairly healthy state?

44:11.500 --> 44:14.880
 And so things like fasting

44:14.880 --> 44:16.900
 and a lot of other therapies

44:16.900 --> 44:19.620
 that have been developed in the field,

44:19.620 --> 44:21.060
 I think ketogenic diet

44:21.060 --> 44:23.740
 may be kind of in this category as well.

44:23.740 --> 44:26.000
 There can be tremendous benefits

44:26.000 --> 44:28.620
 in terms of their impact

44:28.620 --> 44:30.900
 in the context of metabolic syndrome

44:30.900 --> 44:33.440
 and for people that are battling,

44:33.440 --> 44:36.340
 you know, eating a continual bad diet

44:36.340 --> 44:37.580
 or something like that.

44:37.580 --> 44:38.740
 And adherence.

44:38.740 --> 44:41.140
 I think one of the reasons for the popularity

44:41.140 --> 44:45.580
 of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,

44:45.580 --> 44:48.440
 and sort of, what do they call them now?

44:48.440 --> 44:51.380
 Exclusion diets where you entirely exclude meat

44:51.380 --> 44:54.140
 or you entirely exclude plants or whatever it is.

44:54.140 --> 44:56.940
 That adherence is sometimes easier in the all or none.

44:57.940 --> 45:00.980
 As neurobiologists, we think of it as a go-no-go circuitry.

45:00.980 --> 45:04.580
 It's harder to make decisions,

45:04.580 --> 45:06.380
 nuanced decisions often about food

45:06.380 --> 45:09.500
 than it is to just eliminate entire categories of food.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.500
 Not eating for many people

45:11.500 --> 45:13.800
 is easier than eating smaller portions.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:16.420 --> 45:19.180
 So some of it I think is neurobiological and psychological.

45:19.180 --> 45:20.020
 Absolutely.

45:20.020 --> 45:22.620
 And we've had gastroenterology fellows in our lab

45:22.620 --> 45:24.300
 that come in and we kind of,

45:24.300 --> 45:27.520
 you know, I think that to kind of slice through

45:27.520 --> 45:28.660
 the nuance of all this,

45:28.660 --> 45:30.100
 there's a very simple recipe

45:30.100 --> 45:33.060
 and a really well-accepted kind of broad definition

45:33.060 --> 45:34.300
 of what a healthy diet is.

45:34.300 --> 45:38.300
 You know, kind of the Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet

45:38.300 --> 45:40.060
 is, you know, there's just a ton of data

45:40.060 --> 45:43.020
 that particularly people of European ancestry,

45:43.020 --> 45:46.300
 but there's a pretty broad acceptance

45:46.300 --> 45:48.540
 that if you eat mostly plants,

45:48.540 --> 45:50.860
 for most people that's gonna be very healthy

45:50.860 --> 45:52.900
 to the point where, you know,

45:52.900 --> 45:55.880
 a wonderful colleague of ours, Christopher Gardner,

45:55.880 --> 45:58.900
 who's studied diet his whole life,

45:58.900 --> 46:00.900
 trying to establish what a healthy diet is

46:00.900 --> 46:02.200
 and people was giving advice.

46:02.200 --> 46:05.240
 I saw him giving advice to a dietician

46:05.240 --> 46:07.080
 who was trying to get all the rules

46:07.080 --> 46:09.480
 of like what she should be recommending

46:09.480 --> 46:11.120
 to people that she deals with

46:11.120 --> 46:12.820
 that are interested in a healthy diet.

46:12.820 --> 46:14.380
 And she said, so the number one,

46:14.380 --> 46:18.100
 I'm gonna say plant-based fiber is probably super important

46:18.100 --> 46:20.080
 and that should be, you know, very high on the list.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.420
 And she goes on to number two and he said, stop.

46:23.420 --> 46:26.580
 He said, if people do number one well,

46:26.580 --> 46:28.540
 you don't need to know any other rules.

46:28.540 --> 46:29.540
 I mean, it's basically like,

46:29.540 --> 46:33.480
 if you can have a high fiber plant-based diet,

46:33.480 --> 46:35.180
 for most people, at least, you know,

46:35.180 --> 46:36.360
 talking about the bucket of people

46:36.360 --> 46:38.200
 that are already in a healthy state,

46:38.200 --> 46:39.860
 you don't really need to think about other things

46:39.860 --> 46:41.340
 because you can't eat too much meat,

46:41.340 --> 46:42.580
 you can't eat too many sweets,

46:42.580 --> 46:45.780
 you've already eaten a huge amount of plant-based fiber.

46:45.780 --> 46:49.460
 Your gut is full, you're not gonna be hungry

46:49.460 --> 46:52.020
 and it kind of takes care of worrying

46:52.020 --> 46:54.300
 about what should I eat or what shouldn't I eat.

46:54.300 --> 46:56.860
 Just eat a ton of whole plant, you know,

46:56.860 --> 47:00.400
 whole grains, legumes, vegetables,

47:00.400 --> 47:02.740
 fruit that's high fiber-based, not high sugar.

47:02.740 --> 47:05.660
 Doesn't completely exclude meat and fish and dairy.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.980
 And he was saying like, you know,

47:06.980 --> 47:08.980
 people can add their own spins on this,

47:08.980 --> 47:11.880
 but I think that the main rule is just

47:11.880 --> 47:12.720
 start off with, you know,

47:12.720 --> 47:15.940
 and it kind of gets back to Michael Pollan's mantra,

47:15.940 --> 47:19.740
 you know, eat food, not too much, mostly plants.

47:19.740 --> 47:20.980
 You know, I think if you stick

47:20.980 --> 47:22.940
 with kind of these simple rules

47:22.940 --> 47:25.100
 and don't overthink like, should I have this,

47:25.100 --> 47:26.900
 you know, can I eat eggs, can I eat,

47:26.900 --> 47:28.760
 you know, just kind of stick to these simple rules,

47:28.760 --> 47:30.440
 it makes it very approachable.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.660
 But I agree, like, so these gastroenterology fellows

47:32.660 --> 47:34.580
 that we've had in our lab say that they,

47:34.580 --> 47:36.640
 it's really hard, we kind of say to them,

47:36.640 --> 47:38.560
 why won't you give this dietary advice?

47:38.560 --> 47:39.780
 It's really well known.

47:39.780 --> 47:42.260
 And they just said, well, it's really hard to get people

47:42.260 --> 47:44.580
 to change their diet unless you're doing

47:44.580 --> 47:46.620
 either a go, no go sort of thing,

47:46.620 --> 47:49.060
 like, or eliminating something.

47:49.060 --> 47:51.260
 So, you know, if carrots are giving you problems,

47:51.260 --> 47:52.080
 don't eat carrots.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.540
 And that's a very simple, easy instruction to follow,

47:55.540 --> 47:58.940
 but doesn't really deal with the root problem

47:58.940 --> 48:00.900
 of why can't you eat carrots?

48:00.900 --> 48:02.780
 Because you should be able to eat carrots.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.180
 Most people can eat carrots.

48:04.180 --> 48:09.180
 And so I think that, you know, there, we, yeah, we, we,

48:11.300 --> 48:15.300
 when we're thinking about things like fasting

48:15.300 --> 48:18.160
 and, you know, all these different dietary regimes

48:18.160 --> 48:20.500
 and cleanses that people do,

48:20.500 --> 48:22.420
 we have to step back for a moment and say,

48:22.420 --> 48:26.320
 okay, well, what are really the big high level rules

48:26.320 --> 48:27.660
 that we should take home?

48:27.660 --> 48:29.860
 And then if you are experiencing problems

48:29.860 --> 48:31.620
 and you wanna think about how to deal with them,

48:31.620 --> 48:33.900
 it's good to go to an evidence-based method

48:33.900 --> 48:35.900
 where there's actually data to back it up.

48:35.900 --> 48:39.380
 The, you know, the data in the field really shows

48:39.380 --> 48:41.940
 that with like fasting, particularly if you go

48:41.940 --> 48:44.100
 to like animals that hibernate or things like that

48:44.100 --> 48:45.700
 where there's really extended fast,

48:45.700 --> 48:49.580
 you actually have a microbiota come up that's,

48:49.580 --> 48:54.580
 that blooms in the absence of food coming in through diet.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.260
 That's really good at eating mucus.

48:57.260 --> 49:01.140
 So you have, you know, bacteria that specialize

49:01.140 --> 49:03.260
 in eating nutrients derived from the host

49:03.260 --> 49:05.560
 because there's no other nutrients to live on.

49:05.560 --> 49:08.420
 Now, whether this is good or bad, we don't know,

49:08.420 --> 49:13.420
 but it seems like the, you know, consumption of mucus

49:13.980 --> 49:17.940
 in excess is a problem from the standpoint

49:17.940 --> 49:20.460
 of microbes getting too close to host tissue

49:20.460 --> 49:21.660
 and inciting inflammation,

49:21.660 --> 49:23.260
 which is what we see in animal models

49:23.260 --> 49:25.780
 when we deprive of dietary fiber.

49:25.780 --> 49:28.460
 We see these mucus utilizers become abundant

49:28.460 --> 49:30.460
 and inflammatory markers start to come on.

49:30.460 --> 49:33.580
 So fasting short-term might be fine.

49:33.580 --> 49:36.260
 Probably, you know, there's definitely benefits

49:36.260 --> 49:37.940
 that are seen metabolically.

49:37.940 --> 49:40.540
 In terms of what it means for long-term health

49:40.540 --> 49:42.340
 from the standpoint of the gut microbiota,

49:42.340 --> 49:44.740
 I would say we don't have the answer to that yet.

49:44.740 --> 49:47.500
 In terms of the, you know, the cleanses and the flushes

49:47.500 --> 49:51.100
 and all this, personally, I think it's a terrible idea.

49:51.100 --> 49:54.220
 I mean, we know that like if, you know,

49:54.220 --> 49:55.500
 in studies that are being done now

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
 to reprogram the gut microbiota

49:57.500 --> 50:00.380
 to install a completely new microbial community,

50:00.380 --> 50:02.540
 the first step is to wash away

50:02.540 --> 50:04.940
 the resident microbial community that's there.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.420
 So if you're in the process

50:06.420 --> 50:08.380
 of acquiring a really good microbiota

50:08.380 --> 50:09.820
 and you know how to do that,

50:09.820 --> 50:12.740
 then the flushing everything out is great.

50:12.740 --> 50:16.140
 Otherwise, what is happening is you're kind of leaving

50:16.140 --> 50:19.660
 rebuilding of the community to chance, like, what is it?

50:19.660 --> 50:23.300
 And so, you know, what microbes are gonna colonize,

50:23.300 --> 50:26.660
 who's gonna take up space after you do this flush or cleanse

50:26.660 --> 50:30.140
 and, you know, that I think it's a little bit

50:30.140 --> 50:31.220
 like playing Russian roulette.

50:31.220 --> 50:34.100
 You may end up with a good microbial community

50:34.100 --> 50:34.940
 in there afterwards.

50:34.940 --> 50:36.100
 You may not.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.740
 You certainly want to pay close attention

50:37.740 --> 50:39.100
 to what you're eating

50:39.100 --> 50:41.420
 while you're doing the reconstitution of the community

50:41.420 --> 50:43.100
 after you do something like that.

50:43.100 --> 50:44.420
 Yeah.

50:44.420 --> 50:45.260
 Thank you for that.

50:45.260 --> 50:46.580
 I know a lot of people are interested

50:46.580 --> 50:48.500
 in these kinds of elimination diets

50:48.500 --> 50:52.100
 and intermittent fasting slash time restricted feeding

50:52.100 --> 50:53.740
 seems to be getting some traction in part

50:53.740 --> 50:57.860
 because at some level, we are all doing this when we sleep.

50:57.860 --> 50:59.780
 Most of us aren't eating while we sleep anyway.

50:59.780 --> 51:03.820
 And adjusting the numbers seems more accessible

51:03.820 --> 51:04.660
 for a lot of people.

51:04.660 --> 51:05.700
 We have a lot of colleagues at Stanford

51:05.700 --> 51:08.940
 who I know happen to follow that regimen

51:08.940 --> 51:10.780
 or a time restricted feeding regimen,

51:10.780 --> 51:13.700
 but also some who follow

51:13.700 --> 51:16.660
 the more traditional meal spacing as well, of course.

51:17.980 --> 51:21.340
 One of the things that I wonder about as we talk about

51:21.340 --> 51:23.780
 primarily plant-based with some, you know,

51:23.780 --> 51:25.060
 what did you say the pollen thing was?

51:25.060 --> 51:28.860
 It was eat mostly plants and then maybe some meat,

51:28.860 --> 51:30.500
 but not too much or not too much.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.460
 Eat food, mostly plants, not too much.

51:32.460 --> 51:33.300
 Got it.

51:33.300 --> 51:35.060
 Or sorry, eat food, not too much, mostly plants.

51:35.060 --> 51:36.100
 Got it.

51:36.100 --> 51:40.420
 You know, and just, I hear this again and again.

51:40.420 --> 51:42.060
 I know there are a number of people

51:42.060 --> 51:45.940
 who do seem to do well on a lower carbohydrate,

51:46.820 --> 51:49.100
 you know, even some people who report feeling much better

51:49.100 --> 51:53.500
 on a like really strictly almost meat organ only diet.

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
 And the only reason I raise this is not,

51:55.500 --> 51:56.900
 I don't participate in any other,

51:56.900 --> 52:01.060
 I'm one of those omnivores out there.

52:01.060 --> 52:04.540
 I do eat some meat and I do eat plants as well.

52:04.540 --> 52:06.700
 But the reason I raise this is that earlier

52:06.700 --> 52:09.020
 you were talking about communities

52:09.020 --> 52:13.340
 that may have microbiota that are healthier than ours

52:13.340 --> 52:14.980
 or at least different than ours.

52:14.980 --> 52:16.380
 And there are communities in the world

52:16.380 --> 52:20.580
 that subsist largely on animal products

52:20.580 --> 52:23.460
 or for which unprocessed animal products

52:23.460 --> 52:25.900
 are considered the richest nutrient foods

52:25.900 --> 52:27.100
 in those communities.

52:27.100 --> 52:30.860
 Protein is very scarce and ancestrally protein

52:30.860 --> 52:31.900
 was more scarce.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.700
 So eggs and meat and things of that sort.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.380
 So could there be a genetic component?

52:35.380 --> 52:37.620
 In other words, if we fast forward 10 years

52:37.620 --> 52:38.820
 and we actually can make sense

52:38.820 --> 52:40.260
 of all this human genome stuff,

52:40.260 --> 52:41.940
 are we going to find that someone

52:41.940 --> 52:45.580
 who has Scandinavian roots

52:45.580 --> 52:47.180
 or somebody who has South American roots

52:47.180 --> 52:49.700
 or somebody had descended from a different tribe

52:49.700 --> 52:52.540
 will do better on one particular diet versus another

52:52.540 --> 52:56.300
 and thereby, or I should say, and in parallel with that,

52:56.300 --> 52:58.580
 that their gut microbiome will have different signatures

52:58.580 --> 53:02.020
 that are, so your microbiome might thrive on plants

53:02.020 --> 53:04.180
 and mine might thrive on organ meats.

53:04.180 --> 53:06.900
 And as I say this, I'm not a big consumer of organ meats.

53:06.900 --> 53:09.300
 I'm just laying this out for sake of example.

53:09.300 --> 53:11.780
 Yeah, yeah, great.

53:11.780 --> 53:16.300
 So a few notes.

53:16.300 --> 53:18.900
 The first one has to do with the carbohydrates

53:18.900 --> 53:20.300
 and restriction of carbohydrates

53:20.300 --> 53:21.740
 and some people feeling healthier

53:21.740 --> 53:23.740
 when they cut carbohydrates out.

53:23.740 --> 53:28.740
 My guess is, this is my theory to be tested,

53:30.100 --> 53:33.300
 that people feel better cutting carbohydrates out

53:33.300 --> 53:37.460
 because the diet that we eat in the United States

53:37.460 --> 53:39.380
 and in industrialized countries,

53:39.380 --> 53:42.220
 the carbohydrates are largely crap.

53:42.220 --> 53:43.060
 Processed.

53:43.060 --> 53:43.900
 They're processed.

53:43.900 --> 53:46.340
 It's like starch, simple sugar.

53:46.340 --> 53:49.100
 It's things that contribute to glycemic index.

53:49.100 --> 53:52.220
 It's these sugars that we eat.

53:52.220 --> 53:54.260
 They make it to our small intestine.

53:54.260 --> 53:56.780
 They get chopped up into simple sugars

53:56.780 --> 53:58.180
 absorbed into our bloodstream

53:58.180 --> 54:00.860
 and we have a ton of glucose then coursing through our veins

54:00.860 --> 54:04.580
 which we know is bad and can lead to things like diabetes.

54:05.780 --> 54:08.940
 If the carbohydrates that were in our diet

54:08.940 --> 54:12.820
 were complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber,

54:12.820 --> 54:15.660
 and we like to refer to the subset of dietary fiber

54:15.660 --> 54:18.100
 that the microbiota can actually access

54:18.100 --> 54:21.540
 as microbiota accessible carbohydrates

54:21.540 --> 54:22.980
 and the reason that we like that term

54:22.980 --> 54:24.860
 is it has the word carbohydrate in it

54:24.860 --> 54:28.300
 and it's to point out that not all carbs are bad.

54:28.300 --> 54:31.300
 It's just there are bad carbs or carbs that are bad

54:31.300 --> 54:33.180
 if you consume them in too high a quantity,

54:33.180 --> 54:36.820
 things like table sugar and simple starches

54:36.820 --> 54:38.540
 but there are good carbs as well

54:38.540 --> 54:40.940
 and these microbiota accessible carbohydrates

54:40.940 --> 54:43.460
 are the complex ones that we can't digest

54:43.460 --> 54:46.220
 and fuel our gut microbiota,

54:46.220 --> 54:48.060
 our gut microbiota can ferment them

54:48.060 --> 54:53.060
 and so I think we probably all would be better off

54:55.620 --> 54:59.020
 with less of the carbs that were typically served

54:59.020 --> 55:03.420
 but most of us and probably the vast majority of us

55:03.420 --> 55:06.820
 would be better off by consuming a lot more carbs

55:06.820 --> 55:09.700
 that were complex, that were microbiota accessible

55:09.700 --> 55:11.580
 and I'll come back to why that's important

55:11.580 --> 55:12.660
 in terms of our biology.

55:12.660 --> 55:14.340
 There are some mechanisms that are known

55:14.340 --> 55:16.780
 as to why those complex carbohydrates

55:16.780 --> 55:19.580
 are so important for our health for most of us.

55:20.820 --> 55:23.860
 I think this aspect of human genetic adaptation to diet

55:23.860 --> 55:27.140
 is super interesting and then layer on top of that

55:27.140 --> 55:29.980
 gut microbiota adaptation to diet

55:29.980 --> 55:33.220
 which is another layer of this that is also fascinating.

55:33.220 --> 55:35.980
 It's very clear that over very short periods of time,

55:35.980 --> 55:38.620
 humans can adapt to differences in their diet.

55:38.620 --> 55:41.820
 Lactase persistence is kind of the classic example of this.

55:41.820 --> 55:44.700
 Just over the past 10,000 years,

55:44.700 --> 55:49.020
 humans, certain groups of humans have adapted

55:49.020 --> 55:53.660
 to being able to consume dairy by taking this enzyme,

55:53.660 --> 55:55.700
 lactase, that normally is just expressed

55:55.700 --> 55:58.220
 in most of the world's population early in life

55:58.220 --> 56:02.940
 to be able to metabolize lactose in breast milk.

56:02.940 --> 56:05.900
 By extending the expression of that throughout life,

56:05.900 --> 56:09.100
 now you can consume milk for your whole life

56:09.100 --> 56:12.540
 and so that is an example of specific populations

56:12.540 --> 56:16.700
 of human genome genetically adapting to diet

56:16.700 --> 56:18.020
 in a very short period of time.

56:18.020 --> 56:19.780
 And there are other examples of this

56:19.780 --> 56:22.540
 and undoubtedly this has happened throughout the world

56:22.540 --> 56:23.820
 to various aspects of diet.

56:23.820 --> 56:26.180
 So certainly it's important to remember

56:26.180 --> 56:30.060
 that there will be different diets

56:30.060 --> 56:31.980
 that are better for different groups

56:31.980 --> 56:35.260
 based on what genes you harbor

56:35.260 --> 56:37.540
 and have in your human genome.

56:37.540 --> 56:40.140
 The other aspect on top of that is that

56:40.140 --> 56:45.140
 there are good examples of the gut microbiome

56:45.460 --> 56:48.060
 adapting to cultural differences in diet.

56:48.060 --> 56:50.060
 And the classic example of this

56:50.060 --> 56:52.940
 is the degradation of seaweed.

56:52.940 --> 56:55.100
 So we know that most Americans,

56:55.100 --> 56:58.340
 if you eat sushi and there's nori there

56:58.340 --> 57:02.340
 and you eat some of this seaweed,

57:02.340 --> 57:05.820
 it has a dietary fiber in it known as porphyrin.

57:05.820 --> 57:09.180
 That porphyrin will shoot through most of us untransformed.

57:09.180 --> 57:12.620
 Inert substance, it'll do other things like retain water

57:12.620 --> 57:14.700
 and serve as kind of something like cellulose,

57:14.700 --> 57:17.780
 not be fermented at a high level.

57:17.780 --> 57:19.300
 If somebody from Southeast Asia

57:19.300 --> 57:22.220
 that's always consumed seaweed

57:22.220 --> 57:24.540
 and is part of a culture that consumes seaweed,

57:24.540 --> 57:27.220
 eats seaweed, they have a gut microbe

57:27.220 --> 57:30.220
 that can now metabolize porphyrin.

57:30.220 --> 57:33.580
 And so there are these very specific gene transfer events

57:33.580 --> 57:36.500
 where the genes for breaking down porphyrin

57:36.500 --> 57:40.220
 have been imported into the microbiome

57:40.220 --> 57:44.380
 of many people in Southeast Asia to...

57:44.380 --> 57:46.540
 We can think of it as helping digest porphyrin,

57:46.540 --> 57:49.180
 but it's really just a microbe that's found a niche,

57:49.180 --> 57:51.500
 found a way to make a living in the gut

57:51.500 --> 57:54.500
 by consuming something that's common in the diet there.

57:54.500 --> 57:55.740
 So there are these different layers.

57:55.740 --> 57:57.260
 There are human genetic adaptations

57:57.260 --> 57:59.900
 and there are microbiome adaptations that are cultural

57:59.900 --> 58:03.540
 and based on people's geographic location.

58:03.540 --> 58:06.460
 But there's no escaping the fact

58:06.460 --> 58:08.700
 that for much of human evolution,

58:08.700 --> 58:12.780
 the vast majority of people that are on this planet

58:12.780 --> 58:17.020
 had ancestors that were hunter-gatherers,

58:17.020 --> 58:21.100
 foraging, consuming huge quantities of plant material,

58:21.100 --> 58:23.380
 just because that's what was there.

58:23.380 --> 58:25.220
 And so one of the groups that we study,

58:25.220 --> 58:28.140
 the Hadza hunter-gatherers in Africa,

58:28.140 --> 58:31.260
 and I should take a moment just to say that

58:31.260 --> 58:35.300
 our research and research of many people in our field

58:35.300 --> 58:39.140
 and other fields rely on study of indigenous communities.

58:39.140 --> 58:42.900
 And it's really important to think of these communities

58:42.900 --> 58:45.580
 as our equals.

58:45.580 --> 58:47.780
 They're modern people on the planet.

58:47.780 --> 58:50.220
 They have interesting lifestyles that are informative

58:50.220 --> 58:53.820
 with regard to certain aspects of human biology.

58:53.820 --> 58:59.220
 But in many cases, they also are leading vulnerable existence.

58:59.220 --> 59:01.900
 And so we really take great care in our research program.

59:01.900 --> 59:03.500
 And it's important for people to realize

59:03.500 --> 59:06.660
 that these populations take partner research

59:06.660 --> 59:08.940
 because they're wonderful research partners.

59:08.940 --> 59:13.420
 And we need to be mindful of kind of thinking about how,

59:13.420 --> 59:16.300
 yeah, both we talk about them and use our data

59:16.300 --> 59:20.340
 that has been gained through their generous contribution

59:20.340 --> 59:22.020
 to our research program.

59:22.020 --> 59:23.980
 The Hadza hunter-gatherers, it's estimated,

59:23.980 --> 59:26.980
 consume on the order of 100 to 150 grams

59:26.980 --> 59:29.420
 of dietary fiber per day.

59:29.420 --> 59:32.660
 And that's in stark contrast to the typical American

59:32.660 --> 59:35.260
 that consumes about 15 grams.

59:35.260 --> 59:39.940
 So somewhere seven to tenfold decrease in the main nutrient

59:39.940 --> 59:43.460
 that feeds our gut microbiome in the American diet.

59:43.460 --> 59:47.740
 The Hadza are, you know, one example.

59:47.740 --> 59:50.460
 There are many different foraging populations,

59:50.460 --> 59:53.740
 but the vast majority of these populations

59:53.740 --> 59:56.460
 consume huge amounts of dietary fiber

59:56.460 --> 59:59.940
 because plants are the reliable, consistent source.

59:59.940 --> 1:00:03.660
 You know, if you, as a hunter-gatherer, go on a hunt,

1:00:03.660 --> 1:00:05.940
 usually that hunt is unsuccessful.

1:00:05.940 --> 1:00:08.020
 You know, I think the data that, you know,

1:00:08.020 --> 1:00:10.700
 one out of 20 to 30 hunts are successful

1:00:10.700 --> 1:00:13.460
 in landing actually big game for the Hadza.

1:00:13.460 --> 1:00:17.260
 They have, you know, birds that they shoot and small animals.

1:00:17.260 --> 1:00:19.580
 But quite often, day after day,

1:00:19.580 --> 1:00:24.620
 they're relying upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit.

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:27.340
 You know, they're relying on the plants in their environment.

1:00:27.340 --> 1:00:30.060
 And actually, if you go to the data

1:00:30.060 --> 1:00:33.100
 and look at what their food preferences are,

1:00:33.100 --> 1:00:35.660
 their food preferences are actually meat and honey.

1:00:35.660 --> 1:00:39.100
 So they don't eat a high-fiber diet because they love fiber.

1:00:39.100 --> 1:00:42.100
 They eat a high-fiber diet because that's what's available

1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:45.540
 and consistent for them to survive.

1:00:45.540 --> 1:00:48.700
 But, you know, our brains are wired for caloric density.

1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:51.340
 And so if you took a Hadza and put them in a restaurant

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:54.260
 in the United States, they would make the same crappy decisions

1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:56.300
 that we make because we, you know,

1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:59.180
 all want sugar and fat and calories.

1:00:59.180 --> 1:01:01.100
 It's how our brain is wired.

1:01:01.100 --> 1:01:03.420
 And protein and fat are essential for brain development

1:01:03.420 --> 1:01:04.420
 as far as we know, right?

1:01:04.420 --> 1:01:06.420
 So it sounds like the Hadza,

1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:08.140
 I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.

1:01:08.140 --> 1:01:11.740
 Oh, you said would prefer to eat meat and honey,

1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:15.220
 but they happen to consume a lot of plant fiber

1:01:15.220 --> 1:01:17.220
 as a consequence of what's available.

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:23.180
 One of the questions I have as it relates to all of this,

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:28.180
 is it sounds to me like there is no question

1:01:28.700 --> 1:01:33.700
 from the pure vegan all the way to the extreme opposite,

1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:37.220
 which would be pure meat diet,

1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:40.220
 that avoiding processed foods is a good idea

1:01:40.220 --> 1:01:42.500
 or heavily processed foods in general.

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:44.100
 And I mean, not that, you know,

1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:47.540
 the occasional consumption is necessarily bad,

1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:50.020
 but whether or not one is thinking

1:01:50.020 --> 1:01:52.100
 about one macronutrient profile or another,

1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:54.460
 it sounds like consuming processed foods

1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:56.380
 is just bad for the microbiome.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:58.180
 Can we say that categorically?

1:01:58.180 --> 1:01:59.020
 For sure.

1:01:59.020 --> 1:01:59.860
 Okay.

1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:01.300
 Whether, you know, so you're low carb person,

1:02:01.300 --> 1:02:04.180
 you're zero carb person, you're extreme vegan, no meat,

1:02:04.180 --> 1:02:06.180
 whether or not you're all meat, organ meat,

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:09.780
 sounds to me as if the number one thing,

1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:14.420
 maybe even dare I say above Chris's point about plants,

1:02:14.420 --> 1:02:15.740
 although I'm not going to challenge Chris Gardner

1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.060
 on nutrition, I would be way outside the lane lines

1:02:19.060 --> 1:02:19.900
 to do that.

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:23.940
 But is it to avoiding processed foods is paramount?

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:26.060
 Yeah, and I think that's completely compatible

1:02:26.060 --> 1:02:27.020
 with what Christopher was saying.

1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:30.220
 He was saying, if you prioritize getting a huge amount

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:35.020
 of whole plant-based food with a lot of fiber first,

1:02:35.020 --> 1:02:36.060
 you're not going to have room

1:02:36.060 --> 1:02:37.460
 for eating a lot of processed food.

1:02:37.460 --> 1:02:40.100
 So it's kind of the same as avoiding processed food.

1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:42.340
 So I think that those are exactly the same rule.

1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:44.740
 And I think that you're exactly right.

1:02:44.740 --> 1:02:46.540
 And we can break down, you know,

1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:48.460
 there's a lot of data of why different components

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.020
 of processed food are so bad for us

1:02:50.020 --> 1:02:51.460
 and so bad for our microbiome.

1:02:51.460 --> 1:02:53.700
 And I can talk about a few examples of that.

1:02:53.700 --> 1:02:57.620
 But the flip side of this is this mechanism of,

1:02:57.620 --> 1:02:59.860
 you know, and again, thinking about the spectrum

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:03.180
 of a plant-based diet versus a meat-based diet,

1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:08.180
 you know, there's a lot of data to tell us that meat

1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:12.820
 or ketogenic or high-fat diet may have big benefits

1:03:12.820 --> 1:03:14.580
 in terms of short-term metabolic health.

1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:17.180
 That's typically how people think about that diet.

1:03:17.180 --> 1:03:18.700
 There's also a lot of heart disease

1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:20.020
 that's linked with that as well.

1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:21.220
 There's good literature for that,

1:03:21.220 --> 1:03:25.100
 which is something for people to look at and be aware of.

1:03:25.100 --> 1:03:27.300
 The plant-based diet, if you're eating a bunch

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:31.900
 of complex, you know, fibers that feed your gut microbiota,

1:03:31.900 --> 1:03:34.740
 your gut microbiota produces these substances

1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:37.500
 called short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate.

1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:40.220
 And it's known that these short-chain fatty acids

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:41.980
 play really essential components,

1:03:41.980 --> 1:03:44.300
 both in terms of fueling colonocytes,

1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:46.940
 enforcing the barrier, keeping inflammation low,

1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:49.860
 regulating the immune system, regulating metabolism.

1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:53.500
 And so, you know, a lot of people think of dietary fiber

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:55.540
 as this inert substance that passes through,

1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:57.420
 makes us feel full maybe for a little bit,

1:03:57.420 --> 1:03:59.180
 but we get hungry afterwards right away.

1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:00.460
 If you're eating a lot of fiber

1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:02.180
 that's feeding your gut microbiota,

1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:06.300
 your gut microbiota is just producing this vast array

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:09.820
 of fermentation and products that then get absorbed

1:04:09.820 --> 1:04:12.580
 into our bloodstream and have all of these tremendous

1:04:12.580 --> 1:04:15.940
 cascading effects that appear to be largely beneficial

1:04:15.940 --> 1:04:17.100
 in our biology.

1:04:17.100 --> 1:04:19.900
 And so to think about that paradigm of simple carbs

1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:22.580
 versus complex carbs, in the case of simple carbs,

1:04:22.580 --> 1:04:24.580
 you end up with high blood sugar, you know,

1:04:24.580 --> 1:04:27.140
 something that will spike your insulin and, you know,

1:04:27.140 --> 1:04:29.380
 have all kinds of weird metabolic effects.

1:04:29.380 --> 1:04:31.620
 In the case of complex carbohydrates,

1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:34.060
 you'll end up with very low blood sugar

1:04:34.060 --> 1:04:36.580
 because most of those have low glycemic index

1:04:36.580 --> 1:04:38.380
 and a bunch of short-chain fatty acids

1:04:38.380 --> 1:04:39.860
 that are having regulatory rules.

1:04:39.860 --> 1:04:42.860
 So just to round out that topic,

1:04:42.860 --> 1:04:45.500
 I think there is a reason to think that, you know,

1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:48.420
 maybe not appropriate for absolutely everyone out there,

1:04:48.420 --> 1:04:51.140
 but I think the vast majority of people,

1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:53.380
 particularly given the statistics of what we know

1:04:53.380 --> 1:04:55.260
 people eat in the United States

1:04:55.260 --> 1:04:56.860
 and in industrialized countries,

1:04:56.860 --> 1:04:59.700
 most people would reap tremendous health benefits

1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:03.580
 from eating more whole plant-based dietary fiber.

1:05:03.580 --> 1:05:06.300
 Now, processed foods, I think, is this other dimension

1:05:06.300 --> 1:05:08.140
 where you have all of these weird chemicals,

1:05:08.140 --> 1:05:12.020
 artificial sweeteners, weird fats, you know,

1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:14.580
 a lot of refined simple nutrients.

1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:16.100
 The simple nutrients we've talked about,

1:05:16.100 --> 1:05:18.540
 but we know that, for instance, artificial sweeteners

1:05:18.540 --> 1:05:21.540
 can have a massive negative impact on the gut microbiome

1:05:21.540 --> 1:05:23.940
 and can lead us towards metabolic syndrome, actually.

1:05:23.940 --> 1:05:25.380
 There's been beautiful work

1:05:25.380 --> 1:05:27.220
 out of the Weizmann Institute on this.

1:05:27.220 --> 1:05:29.380
 And then emulsifiers, these compounds

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:31.180
 that are put in processed foods

1:05:31.180 --> 1:05:34.180
 to help them maintain shelf stability

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:37.060
 so things don't separate and so, you know,

1:05:37.060 --> 1:05:40.740
 all the moisture content is retained appropriately.

1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:45.060
 Many of these are known to disrupt the mucus layer,

1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:47.260
 and as soon as you start disrupting that barrier,

1:05:47.260 --> 1:05:49.780
 that can lead you in the direction of inflammation

1:05:49.780 --> 1:05:51.780
 and in animal models, we know that can lead

1:05:51.780 --> 1:05:53.380
 towards metabolic syndrome as well.

1:05:53.380 --> 1:05:56.900
 So there's components of processed food

1:05:56.900 --> 1:05:58.700
 that are, when studied in isolation,

1:05:58.700 --> 1:06:00.500
 known to have a direct negative impact

1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:02.980
 on gut biology and the microbiota.

1:06:02.980 --> 1:06:05.580
 The mention of artificial sweeteners is interesting.

1:06:05.580 --> 1:06:09.100
 I confess, it's a third rail on social,

1:06:09.100 --> 1:06:10.260
 talking about artificial sweeteners,

1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:13.700
 there are two camps, it seems, or at least two camps,

1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:15.660
 one that say artificial sweeteners

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.220
 are not detrimental at all,

1:06:17.220 --> 1:06:18.660
 another that says they're very detrimental,

1:06:18.660 --> 1:06:19.980
 mainly based on the mouse studies,

1:06:19.980 --> 1:06:21.180
 and then there are people in the middle

1:06:21.180 --> 1:06:23.140
 that are, I put myself in that category,

1:06:23.140 --> 1:06:25.020
 I drink the occasional diet soda,

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:26.500
 I don't consume them in large volume,

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:28.060
 but I'm sort of in the middle there.

1:06:28.060 --> 1:06:30.900
 However, and so I just throw that out there

1:06:30.900 --> 1:06:33.820
 because I know immediately people are jumping on that,

1:06:33.820 --> 1:06:36.300
 but I will just mention there's some recent data

1:06:36.300 --> 1:06:38.740
 out of Diego Borges' lab at Duke University

1:06:38.740 --> 1:06:40.500
 that the neurons that live in the gut mucosa,

1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:43.140
 these neuropod cells can actually distinguish

1:06:43.140 --> 1:06:46.700
 between artificial and true sweet,

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:50.260
 sugar versus artificial sweeteners.

1:06:50.260 --> 1:06:52.220
 They send different patterns of neural signals

1:06:52.220 --> 1:06:54.420
 up to the brain and the brain circuitry

1:06:54.420 --> 1:06:55.780
 seems strongly impacted.

1:06:55.780 --> 1:06:57.620
 So I think that as the data emerge,

1:06:57.620 --> 1:07:00.380
 we're hearing more and more of these artificial sweeteners

1:07:00.380 --> 1:07:02.980
 either are problematic or at least are signaling

1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:05.900
 different events in the gut.

1:07:05.900 --> 1:07:08.940
 I do want to make sure that we distinguish

1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:13.300
 artificial sweeteners from non-caloric plant-based sweeteners

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:15.220
 and this is based on a mistake that I've made

1:07:15.220 --> 1:07:16.940
 over and over again on the podcast

1:07:16.940 --> 1:07:20.060
 where I'll just kind of lump artificial sweeteners

1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:23.140
 into one big category and then I'll mention stevia.

1:07:23.140 --> 1:07:24.940
 So what about plant-based sweeteners

1:07:24.940 --> 1:07:26.540
 that are not artificial?

1:07:26.540 --> 1:07:28.100
 They weren't manufactured in a laboratory

1:07:28.100 --> 1:07:31.120
 like saccharin or sucralose or aspartame.

1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:34.880
 Do we know anything about plant-based non-caloric sweeteners

1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:36.940
 or low-caloric sweeteners?

1:07:36.940 --> 1:07:38.020
 Very little.

1:07:38.020 --> 1:07:41.500
 A lot of those have a lot more bang for the buck.

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:44.140
 They're incredibly sweet so it takes a really small amount

1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:46.340
 for them to trigger a huge amount of sweetness.

1:07:46.340 --> 1:07:51.180
 And so it's depending upon the mechanism of action

1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:54.660
 by which these sweeteners that are not sugar

1:07:54.660 --> 1:07:57.420
 are impacting our biology.

1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:02.260
 It may be that those are actually less negative

1:08:02.260 --> 1:08:05.820
 or more healthy than the ones that are artificial

1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:08.520
 just because it requires less of them in the food

1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.340
 for us to perceive that sweet taste.

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:12.500
 It may also be that because they're,

1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:14.580
 I don't think that everything that's natural

1:08:14.580 --> 1:08:17.420
 is better necessarily than things that are artificial

1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:21.380
 but it may be that because of kind of evolutionary exposure

1:08:21.380 --> 1:08:23.700
 to these compounds in our diet,

1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:26.340
 historically there are I think traditional populations

1:08:26.340 --> 1:08:31.340
 that use these for instance to sweeten different foods

1:08:31.340 --> 1:08:34.000
 that our bodies just kind of know how to deal

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.640
 with those compounds better than the ones

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:37.120
 that are synthetic.

1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:40.000
 But I think the studies still need to be done.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.480
 Do you actively avoid artificial sweeteners,

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:45.720
 sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, you personally?

1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:48.520
 Yeah, so I do.

1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:50.380
 I avoid them but I'm not,

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:55.960
 so I work closely with my wife Erica as you know.

1:08:55.960 --> 1:09:00.560
 We were in the lab together and we wrote this book,

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:03.520
 The Good Gut, where we kind of document our journey

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:06.640
 in changing our lifestyle, dietary habits,

1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:08.400
 choices we make based on the research

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:10.280
 as we've gotten to know it in the gut microbiota

1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:11.860
 over the past 15 years.

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:16.860
 And I think that one of the lessons that we've learned

1:09:17.980 --> 1:09:21.560
 is that just doing things in moderation

1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:24.080
 makes it a lot easier

1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:26.200
 and doing things slowly makes it a lot easier.

1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:29.640
 And so there are very few rules that I have

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:30.720
 that are hard and fast.

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:32.600
 I'm a pretty flexible eater.

1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:34.560
 I don't believe that having an artificial,

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:37.880
 having a diet Coke will somehow cascade

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:40.840
 into some terrible disease or something like that.

1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:42.140
 I try to avoid them.

1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:43.520
 I don't really like the flavor of them.

1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:47.120
 I'm super sensitive to the nuances of the flavor

1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:50.080
 even with the stevia and magra sites from monk fruit

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:51.380
 and stuff like that.

1:09:51.380 --> 1:09:53.720
 The off flavors are really hard for me to deal with.

1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:58.720
 But I also in this journey of changing our diet,

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.520
 when we started off in microbiome research,

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:03.480
 I was in the habit of, in the afternoons,

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:06.400
 having a sweet, a muffin or a cookie or something like that.

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:07.960
 And when we started to realize

1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:10.480
 that we should be eating less sweets

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.560
 and eating more dietary fiber,

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:14.940
 this was an incredibly difficult change for me to make.

1:10:14.940 --> 1:10:18.280
 I was just wired to kind of crave this.

1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:19.920
 Classic scientist.

1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:23.040
 Scientists love the pastry in the afternoon and the coffee.

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:25.720
 And in the old days, it used to be a cigarette too.

1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:26.560
 Right, exactly.

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:27.680
 When I started my training,

1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:29.080
 a lot of people still smoked.

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:29.920
 Yeah, right.

1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:32.160
 And it was only during my postdoctoral training

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:33.940
 that they eliminated smoking on campuses.

1:10:33.940 --> 1:10:37.240
 And productivity took a trough for a while.

1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:39.280
 And until these people developed other tools

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:41.080
 to focus their attention.

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:42.240
 Exactly, exactly.

1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:44.180
 So there is this kind of like need.

1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:46.040
 And then once you have an ingrained behavior

1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:47.340
 and maybe things that are addictive,

1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:50.800
 it becomes incredibly difficult to break that habit.

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:55.800
 And so I would say gradually over the course of like,

1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:58.200
 you know, five or more years,

1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:02.080
 we have, you know, migrated our diet away from sweet foods

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:05.860
 to things that are less sweet.

1:11:05.860 --> 1:11:07.960
 And it's, you know, it's been a journey.

1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:09.760
 It's been a slow process.

1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:10.960
 But we've gotten to the point now

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:12.800
 where we've just retrained our palates.

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:15.000
 And it's amazing how this happens now

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.720
 where I'll have something that, you know,

1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:20.760
 is something that I would have used to have like daily.

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:22.480
 And it's unpalatable.

1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:24.920
 I like, I just can't deal with the sweetness of it.

1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:28.960
 And so I avoid, I certainly avoid artificial sweeteners,

1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:31.480
 but I also avoid just sweet things in general

1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:33.040
 that have sugar in them,

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:35.000
 just because they now, they, you know,

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.560
 as originally I was trying to be disciplined

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:39.560
 and trying to change my diet,

1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:41.320
 but now they just don't taste good to me.

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:42.140
 Yeah, likewise.

1:11:42.140 --> 1:11:44.800
 I completely lost my appetite for sugar

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.000
 at the turn of the last year.

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.280
 And I don't know how to explain it,

1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:49.520
 but the way I, even though

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:51.300
 I don't have a mechanistic explanation,

1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:52.840
 I just, I say, I like sweet people.

1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:54.480
 I don't like sweet food anymore.

1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:55.380
 I just don't.

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:58.320
 I have not lost my appetite for fatty foods.

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:02.600
 I love cheese and certain meats for me.

1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:07.240
 I blame my Argentine lineage as I gravitate towards them.

1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:10.520
 But in any case, avoiding processed foods,

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:12.960
 probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers,

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:13.800
 these kinds of things.

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:15.840
 And for people listening or watching,

1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:17.800
 we're not setting up strict guidelines.

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:21.680
 We're just bouncing around the carnival

1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:24.160
 that is the microbiome and nutrition,

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:25.600
 because I think that these,

1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:28.480
 we hear this everywhere, eat this, don't eat that,

1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:30.720
 or this is best for microbiome or worse for microbiome,

1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:32.600
 but I'm hearing fiber again and again.

1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:34.040
 So we're going to come back to fiber,

1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:36.720
 but I want to make sure that we close the hatch

1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:39.180
 on this issue of fasting and cleansing.

1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:40.720
 Based on your answer earlier,

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:43.500
 it sounds to me like it is not necessary

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:46.740
 to do a cleanse or fast prior to an attempt

1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:48.640
 to repopulate the microbiome.

1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:51.240
 In other words, if I want to make my microbiome healthier,

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:52.720
 it sounds like I don't have to try

1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:56.280
 and flush all the current microbiota out of there first.

1:12:56.280 --> 1:12:57.120
 Is that correct?

1:12:57.120 --> 1:12:59.200
 Yeah, it's a very good question.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.920
 And I don't mean to suggest that those things

1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:03.800
 are known to be terrible,

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:06.780
 or I would just say the studies haven't been done.

1:13:06.780 --> 1:13:09.920
 And to me, wiping out this microbial community,

1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:13.440
 unless it's done with some sort of,

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:15.260
 unless it's done in an informed way,

1:13:15.260 --> 1:13:16.720
 and we don't really have the information

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:18.060
 for how that would be done,

1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:21.960
 it just seems like playing the lottery a little bit.

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:25.000
 And so I think, I don't want to say that those,

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.820
 it may be that when the study is done,

1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:28.500
 those are shown to be amazing,

1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:30.640
 but I just don't think we have the data to know that yet.

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:33.340
 So it's somewhat of an arbitrary thing.

1:13:33.340 --> 1:13:36.960
 If somebody out there feels way better when they do this

1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:39.360
 and are not experiencing problems with it,

1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:40.960
 then maybe it's the right thing for them.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:44.120
 But I certainly can't say that it's something great to do.

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:48.720
 I can't imagine a future where as the microbiome

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:51.400
 gets incorporated into this emerging paradigm

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:54.200
 of precision health, you go into a clinic,

1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:56.080
 somebody types your microbiome and says,

1:13:56.080 --> 1:13:59.400
 oh, there's this huge, massive misconfiguration.

1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:02.120
 You have all these engrafted bacteria that live

1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:04.080
 that are residents in your gut microbiome

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:06.120
 that are sending out molecules

1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:07.760
 that are not good for your health.

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:10.640
 It would be good if we do a mass reprogramming of it.

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:13.680
 The way that we do that is we flush your gut

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:16.120
 and we actually give a light antibiotic treatment

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:18.100
 to try to kill everything that's there.

1:14:18.100 --> 1:14:21.480
 And then we repopulate with this other consortium

1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:24.160
 of microbes that we've studied and know are healthy,

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.480
 know are compatible with your human genome

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:28.440
 and can be reinforced with a diet

1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:30.060
 that we know is good for you.

1:14:30.060 --> 1:14:31.720
 We'll install those microbes.

1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:33.960
 We'll help you along in the diet

1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:36.400
 so you know how to nourish those microbes.

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:38.480
 And that will be the way that we'll reconfigure

1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:39.400
 your gut microbiome.

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.880
 So I can't imagine a future where that sort of flushing

1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:46.700
 or cleansing is part of something for repopulating the gut.

1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:50.400
 But right now it seems a little half-baked to me, yeah.

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:51.920
 Great.

1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:54.920
 I'd love to talk about fiber and fermented foods

1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:58.460
 because you and Chris had a really,

1:14:58.460 --> 1:15:01.620
 what I think is a really interesting and exciting paper

1:15:01.620 --> 1:15:06.620
 at the end of last year about comparing the inflammatome,

1:15:06.900 --> 1:15:08.740
 so inflammatory markers of people

1:15:08.740 --> 1:15:11.280
 who ate a certain amount of fiber

1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:13.600
 or a certain amount of these fermented foods.

1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:16.680
 This study is amazing for several reasons,

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:21.680
 but almost as amazing is how diverse the interpretation

1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:24.640
 of this study was in the media.

1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:28.800
 If ever there was a study that was kind of hijacked

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:33.520
 by different priority schemes out there, it's this study.

1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:36.460
 So you performed the study with Chris

1:15:36.460 --> 1:15:39.300
 and your postdocs and graduate students and staff.

1:15:39.300 --> 1:15:40.960
 What are the major conclusions

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:43.080
 and what sorts of directives, if any,

1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:44.540
 emerge from this study?

1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:46.760
 And I'll just preface this again by saying,

1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:50.300
 if I wasn't clear, some news reports said,

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.140
 ah, this means fiber is not important.

1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:55.980
 And then others said, this means fermented foods

1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:57.460
 and fiber are important.

1:15:57.460 --> 1:16:00.100
 And others said, fermented foods are the thing

1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:03.360
 and the only thing, it was all over the place.

1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:06.960
 And one of the reasons for doing this podcast at all

1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:09.640
 is so that we can go straight to the people

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:10.880
 who perform the work.

1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:13.880
 And even though I'm certainly not an expert in microbiome,

1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:15.760
 give you the opportunity to share with me

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.440
 and me to ask the kinds of questions

1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:18.960
 that I have zero agenda.

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:20.820
 I do like sauerkraut.

1:16:20.820 --> 1:16:25.240
 I do drink the occasional kombucha.

1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:29.200
 I do like low sugar, not so sweet forms of fermented foods.

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.520
 So I would be delighted if fermented foods are good for me,

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:34.520
 but I have no steak in the fermented food industry.

1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:35.360
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:36.180
 Yeah.

1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:37.640
 Yeah, great.

1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:38.480
 Yeah, wonderful.

1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.480
 And an important note there is the one you pointed out

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.040
 that this is an incredible collaboration

1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:46.800
 with Christopher Gardner's lab and a bunch of people.

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:48.560
 Erika Sonnenberg helped lead this study

1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:51.460
 and then tons of, like you were saying, postdoc staff

1:16:51.460 --> 1:16:53.800
 and other people at Stanford

1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:55.160
 and then wonderful participants

1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:57.320
 that were part of this study.

1:16:57.320 --> 1:16:59.000
 So a huge team effort.

1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:02.580
 Before I dive into that study, let me take a step back

1:17:02.580 --> 1:17:04.880
 because I think the reason that we did this study

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.880
 and kind of Christopher's group and our group

1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:10.960
 has started to pursue this line

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:13.440
 of looking at dietary interventions

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:14.920
 and how they impact our microbiome,

1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:17.600
 how they impact human biology

1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:22.080
 goes back to this kind of epiphany that we had

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.600
 while studying the gut microbiome

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:26.540
 because I think when we started studying it at Stanford,

1:17:26.540 --> 1:17:27.520
 we were thinking about it

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:30.920
 as this kind of newly appreciated aspect of our biology,

1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:35.360
 almost like finding an organ that we didn't know was there

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:37.880
 and starting to think about all the drug targets

1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:38.720
 that were there.

1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:40.360
 Can we go in with small molecule drugs

1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:42.600
 and think of ways to manipulate this community

1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:44.260
 to ameliorate disease?

1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:47.360
 And this is largely the mindset of Western medicine

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:50.300
 and largely born out of the era of infectious disease.

1:17:50.300 --> 1:17:53.560
 You wait for an infection to start a bacterial infection,

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:54.820
 you treat with antibiotics

1:17:54.820 --> 1:17:56.840
 and that's the way medicine is practiced

1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:59.760
 and that's become less successful over time

1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:02.000
 as we've moved into this era

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.800
 of inflammatory Western diseases

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:09.080
 and with the exception of the current pandemic

1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:10.960
 that's sweeping the world,

1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:15.040
 largely moved out of the era of infectious diseases,

1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:17.260
 at least infectious bacterial diseases,

1:18:17.260 --> 1:18:21.200
 that this paradigm of waiting for diseases to appear

1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:25.000
 and come into the clinic is not really very effective

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.800
 in the context of inflammatory Western diseases,

1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:30.240
 autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome,

1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:32.280
 heart diseases and inflammatory disease,

1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:33.700
 the list goes on and on.

1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:37.920
 And so we started to think a lot about

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:39.360
 how can we get out in front of this?

1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:42.240
 How can we think about like preventative ways

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.480
 of dealing with this crisis

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:47.160
 of metabolic and inflammatory diseases

1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:50.120
 and this tremendous beautiful body of literature

1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:53.920
 started to come forward in the field about 10 years ago

1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:57.880
 that showed that the gut microbiome is absolutely critical

1:18:57.880 --> 1:18:59.720
 to modulating our immune status.

1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:01.720
 So if you change the microbiome,

1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:05.440
 you can fundamentally change how the immune system operates.

1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:09.440
 And we know that the immune system is at the basis

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:13.480
 of a lot of these diseases, inflammatory, chronic diseases.

1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:15.580
 And so it brought up this possibility

1:19:15.580 --> 1:19:18.600
 that maybe the fact that we're not nourishing

1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:19.760
 this community well enough,

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.720
 maybe the fact that it's deteriorated over time

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.520
 due to all of the things that go along

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:29.760
 with an industrialized lifestyle, antibiotics and so forth,

1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:32.660
 maybe we have a microbiome right now

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:34.140
 in the industrialized world

1:19:34.140 --> 1:19:36.780
 that is setting our immune system at a set point,

1:19:36.780 --> 1:19:39.460
 simmering inflammation that's driving us

1:19:39.460 --> 1:19:41.480
 towards these inflammatory diseases.

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:43.640
 And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could figure out

1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:48.640
 how to use diet specifically,

1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:52.000
 but just kind of learn the rules of how to reconfigure

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.840
 both the composition and function of our gut microbiome

1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:58.360
 so that inflammation was different in our bodies

1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:01.540
 so that each one of us was less likely to go on

1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:03.320
 and to develop an inflammatory disease

1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:07.080
 leading to better longevity and health

1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:08.400
 over the course of our life.

1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:13.400
 And so we were studying this actually in mouse models

1:20:14.420 --> 1:20:17.540
 and realizing that we really needed

1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:19.040
 to start doing human studies.

1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:23.280
 We needed to start studying microbiome in humans.

1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:25.600
 And because we were studying diet,

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:26.820
 we knew that this was something

1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:28.080
 we could go in and do right away.

1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:30.880
 We didn't have to apply for FDA approval for a drug

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:32.480
 before we could do a human study.

1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:35.280
 We could just start doing human dietary interventions,

1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:38.560
 longitudinally monitoring the immune system

1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:42.000
 and the microbiome and starting to put the pieces together

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.500
 of what is it in diet that can change our microbiome

1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:48.240
 in a healthy way, help us define what a healthy microbiome is

1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:51.360
 and monitor the immune system in great detail.

1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:53.820
 And so there were really two critical components of this

1:20:53.820 --> 1:20:56.120
 in addition to our microbiome expertise.

1:20:56.120 --> 1:20:58.560
 One was Christopher Gardner's group.

1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:00.520
 We wanted to do these human studies,

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:03.040
 but we're absolutely terrified of humans.

1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:06.640
 We work with mice, humans are terrifying in many ways.

1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:07.760
 But they house themselves.

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:10.040
 You don't have to pay for their housing.

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:10.880
 That's true, yeah.

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:13.880
 For those that can afford housing, of course, yeah.

1:21:13.880 --> 1:21:16.600
 Yeah, sadly, just for that portion of the population.

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.240
 So Christopher's group,

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:21.940
 they are masters at working with human populations.

1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:24.440
 And then the other wonderful thing that we have at Stanford

1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:26.720
 is this Human Immune Monitoring Center

1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:28.640
 run by Mark Davis and Holden Maker.

1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:30.840
 They started this beautiful center

1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:35.320
 for allowing people to do immunology in humans.

1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:37.740
 Critical element because a lot of the mouse studies

1:21:37.740 --> 1:21:39.140
 don't translate well to humans.

1:21:39.140 --> 1:21:41.040
 So if you can do the studies in humans,

1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:43.600
 similar to how we're thinking about the microbiome,

1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:45.920
 you learn something that you know is relevant to humans.

1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:49.000
 And so having that immune profiling capability

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.240
 where we can monitor hundreds to thousands

1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.160
 of different parameters in the immune system longitudinally

1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:57.040
 in people from a blood draw,

1:21:57.040 --> 1:21:59.460
 and not just know if CRP goes up

1:21:59.460 --> 1:22:01.500
 or if interleukin-6 goes up or down,

1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:03.400
 but to be able to see all these facets

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:05.280
 of the immune system change in concert

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.480
 as we're changing the microbiome with diet

1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:09.400
 was really a key component of this.

1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:14.040
 And so our flagship study supported by wonderful donors,

1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:17.320
 so this actually isn't funded by typical foundations

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:18.560
 and National Institutes of Health.

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:21.440
 It was funded by philanthropy.

1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:23.120
 We wanted to understand

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:26.000
 if we put people on a high fiber diet,

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.240
 how would that affect their microbiome and immune system?

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:30.720
 And if we put them on a high fermented food diet,

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:33.620
 a diet rich in live microbes and all the metabolites

1:22:33.620 --> 1:22:36.320
 that are present from fermentation and foods,

1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:38.520
 how would that change microbiome and immune system?

1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:39.600
 Could you give us some examples

1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:40.720
 of what those diets look like?

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:43.000
 And were you changing their basal diet

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.480
 or were you just adding things on top

1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:46.520
 of what they were already eating?

1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:47.560
 So-

1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:49.360
 Because it's hard to change people's diets.

1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:50.200
 It's very hard.

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:51.680
 And you have to trust that they actually do it

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:54.000
 and they're not sneaking and-

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:54.960
 Totally, yeah.

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:57.840
 And so we've started

1:22:57.840 --> 1:23:00.000
 the Center for Human Microbiome Studies at Stanford

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.600
 for doing a lot of these studies.

1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:04.760
 And a portion of the studies we do focus on supplements,

1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:07.940
 probiotics, microbes delivered in pill form,

1:23:07.940 --> 1:23:11.880
 prebiotics, which are purified forms of fiber.

1:23:11.880 --> 1:23:16.600
 And in those cases, we actually can have placebo groups

1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:19.340
 because it's more like a drug study

1:23:19.340 --> 1:23:22.120
 and we don't change people's diets.

1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:24.880
 So we can just administer this on top of what they're doing.

1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.780
 So in a way, they're a lot more controlled,

1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:28.300
 but it's not food.

1:23:28.300 --> 1:23:30.000
 When you start doing food studies,

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:31.480
 you can't do a placebo group

1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:33.040
 because people know what they're eating.

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:35.280
 And the other problem is that

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:39.400
 it's really hard to just change one thing

1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:41.700
 because as soon as you start adding something,

1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:43.520
 people usually eliminate something else.

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:46.840
 So the idea was to basically give these people

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:50.660
 simple instructions for, in the case of the high fiber diet,

1:23:50.660 --> 1:23:53.360
 just increasing plant-based fiber.

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:55.000
 So can you eat more whole grains,

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.600
 more legumes, more vegetables, nuts,

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:00.160
 get the fiber up in the range of,

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:04.380
 from 15 to 20 grams per day, up to over 40 grams per day.

1:24:04.380 --> 1:24:06.740
 So can you kind of double or more

1:24:06.740 --> 1:24:09.160
 the amount of fiber that you eat per day,

1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:12.280
 knowing that that would have a tremendous impact

1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:15.080
 on a lot of other facets of their diet.

1:24:15.080 --> 1:24:20.080
 They eat less meat, animal-based protein,

1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:23.860
 less animal-based fats as a product of this.

1:24:23.860 --> 1:24:27.580
 I will say that getting back to Christopher's rule

1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:31.900
 for a healthy diet, a lot of the macronutrient changes

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:35.200
 that we saw in their diet were consistent

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:39.380
 with healthy changes in diet, less saturated fat,

1:24:39.380 --> 1:24:42.580
 less animal-based protein, more plant-based protein.

1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:46.740
 So a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial

1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:48.660
 kind of came in concert with just telling people

1:24:48.660 --> 1:24:52.520
 to eat a high fiber diet, high plant-based fiber diet.

1:24:53.460 --> 1:24:57.360
 The people that were eating the high fermented food diet,

1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:00.860
 they were instructed to basically eat

1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:04.720
 foods that you could buy at a grocery store

1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:07.940
 that were naturally fermented and contain live microbes.

1:25:07.940 --> 1:25:11.740
 And so this largely consisted of yogurt,

1:25:11.740 --> 1:25:16.740
 kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, some fermented vegetables,

1:25:16.740 --> 1:25:21.180
 kind of brined fermented vegetables, pickles,

1:25:21.180 --> 1:25:24.540
 things like that, but one of the things

1:25:24.540 --> 1:25:27.100
 that I think is a pitfall in choosing fermented foods

1:25:27.100 --> 1:25:29.860
 is you can go down the canned food aisle

1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:32.420
 and there's this huge section of pickles

1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:34.460
 and jars that are canned.

1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:36.320
 Those are not fermented foods.

1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.500
 Those are cucumbers that they've put in,

1:25:38.500 --> 1:25:41.620
 acetic acid and vinegar to reconstitute

1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:44.700
 that fermented flavor, but there's no live microbes

1:25:44.700 --> 1:25:45.700
 involved in that.

1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:47.940
 And even sauerkrauts in the canned food aisle,

1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:49.760
 even if they were naturally fermented,

1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:50.620
 quite often they're not.

1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:54.140
 Quite often they're just brined in vinegar,

1:25:54.140 --> 1:25:56.020
 but even if they are naturally fermented,

1:25:56.020 --> 1:25:58.820
 all of the microbes are killed prior to canning

1:25:58.820 --> 1:26:00.420
 or during the process of canning.

1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:02.820
 And so what we use for this study,

1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:04.700
 and if you want to have live fermented foods

1:26:04.700 --> 1:26:06.860
 that contain live microbes, you need to buy those

1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:10.780
 out of the refrigerated section, essentially.

1:26:10.780 --> 1:26:13.280
 And I'm really glad you pointed this out

1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:18.280
 because you can find sauerkraut on the non-refrigerated shelf

1:26:18.700 --> 1:26:20.960
 that is indeed non-fermented.

1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:23.820
 A lot of fermented foods that are available in the US

1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.720
 can be high in sugar.

1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:29.960
 So was there any instruction as to getting people

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:32.300
 to make sure that they were consuming yogurts

1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:34.720
 that weren't loaded with sugar,

1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:39.200
 or did you let them just select for the stuff in the cold,

1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:40.860
 the cold section that is fermented?

1:26:40.860 --> 1:26:43.740
 No, it's a super important point, we instructed people

1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:46.120
 to eat non-sweetened yogurts.

1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:50.300
 I think a huge pitfall in this area

1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:52.640
 is you can have a yogurt loaded with bacteria,

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:54.660
 kind of the base of what's healthy,

1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:57.340
 and then a ton of artificial flavoring

1:26:57.340 --> 1:26:59.020
 and sugar loaded on top of that.

1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:01.940
 Manufacturers put a ton of sugar in after the fact

1:27:01.940 --> 1:27:04.460
 to kind of mask the sour taste of fermented foods,

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:07.420
 which is hard for some people to become accustomed to.

1:27:07.420 --> 1:27:09.900
 When we were switching to more fermented foods,

1:27:09.900 --> 1:27:11.700
 our daughters were young at that point,

1:27:11.700 --> 1:27:15.220
 we would take plain yogurt, which they didn't like,

1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:17.100
 just kind of neat.

1:27:17.100 --> 1:27:20.140
 We would mix in a little maple syrup or honey,

1:27:20.140 --> 1:27:23.180
 just a little bit, and gradually we reduced that over time

1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:25.660
 to the point where they're palate adjusted

1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:28.620
 and now they just really like plain yogurt.

1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:33.260
 But I think getting used to that sour flavor is difficult,

1:27:33.260 --> 1:27:35.120
 but people really should try to stay away

1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:37.820
 from those fermented foods that are loaded with sugar,

1:27:37.820 --> 1:27:40.140
 and that's what we instructed people in the study.

1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:42.440
 And beer was not included, right?

1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:43.540
 There were a number of people that asked

1:27:43.540 --> 1:27:46.860
 when I did a brief thing on social media about this study

1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:49.680
 and hopefully I got it right, I think I did,

1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:51.180
 but people just ask about beer.

1:27:51.180 --> 1:27:56.060
 I'm not a drinker, so for me, beer has no appeal anyway,

1:27:56.060 --> 1:28:00.100
 but beer is fermented, correct?

1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:03.180
 But were they instructed to avoid beer or to drink beer?

1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:05.300
 Just to go with their normal dietary habits,

1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:07.820
 but that did not count as a fermented food.

1:28:07.820 --> 1:28:09.100
 And kombucha was, as I recall.

1:28:09.100 --> 1:28:10.740
 Kombucha was, and kombucha can have

1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:12.900
 small amounts of alcohol in it.

1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:17.900
 But kombucha actually was one of the major things

1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:22.380
 that people consumed during the fermented food phase.

1:28:22.380 --> 1:28:27.380
 And the deal with beer is that there may be

1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:31.900
 beneficial properties of the microbial communities

1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:33.800
 in naturally fermented beer, but most of the beer

1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:36.260
 that we buy, again, is canned and filtered

1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:38.100
 and there's no live microbes there.

1:28:38.100 --> 1:28:41.580
 So very different than if you siphon it off of your homebrew

1:28:41.580 --> 1:28:44.500
 and drink it, probably, than if you buy it in a store.

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.340
 I will get to the results of the study in just one moment,

1:28:47.340 --> 1:28:49.580
 but I want to say a lot of people shy away

1:28:49.580 --> 1:28:51.940
 from the high quality fermented foods

1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:54.500
 because they can be quite costly.

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:56.260
 I'll just refer people to a resource

1:28:56.260 --> 1:28:58.700
 in Tim Ferriss' book, The 4-Hour Chef.

1:28:58.700 --> 1:29:00.340
 He actually gives an excellent recipe

1:29:00.340 --> 1:29:01.580
 for making your own sauerkraut,

1:29:01.580 --> 1:29:06.540
 which basically involves cabbage and water and salt,

1:29:06.540 --> 1:29:09.500
 but you have to do it properly because you can grow some,

1:29:09.500 --> 1:29:13.900
 not necessarily lethal, but some somewhat dangerous bacteria

1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:16.020
 if you don't scrape off the top layer properly.

1:29:16.020 --> 1:29:17.460
 But he gives beautiful instructions

1:29:17.460 --> 1:29:18.860
 for how to do this in vats.

1:29:18.860 --> 1:29:21.760
 We've started doing this at home now, actually,

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:22.700
 which is a ceramic vat.

1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:24.220
 And so you can make large amounts

1:29:24.220 --> 1:29:26.620
 of truly fermented sauerkraut

1:29:26.620 --> 1:29:28.900
 just from cabbage, water, and salt

1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:30.860
 if you're willing to follow the protocol.

1:29:30.860 --> 1:29:32.020
 And if you're interested in science,

1:29:32.020 --> 1:29:33.980
 that protocol looks a lot like what you'll do

1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:35.860
 for most of your graduate career,

1:29:35.860 --> 1:29:37.820
 except maybe some sequencing too.

1:29:37.820 --> 1:29:39.660
 So anyway, just to refer people to a source

1:29:39.660 --> 1:29:42.500
 that's very low cost compared to buying

1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:43.700
 the high quality fermented foods.

1:29:43.700 --> 1:29:45.620
 Even kombuchas, for some people,

1:29:45.620 --> 1:29:48.600
 it's like $5 a bottle, only this much.

1:29:48.600 --> 1:29:50.660
 And if you consume liquids the way I consume them,

1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:53.580
 that's just the start.

1:29:54.780 --> 1:29:56.900
 But if you can get your hands on a scoby,

1:29:56.900 --> 1:29:58.740
 kombucha is another one that's super simple.

1:29:58.740 --> 1:29:59.580
 It's like-

1:29:59.580 --> 1:30:00.420
 You can grow your own.

1:30:00.420 --> 1:30:02.500
 You can just make your own and it's super easy to do.

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:04.620
 I make it, I constantly have a batch

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:06.100
 of kombucha going at home.

1:30:06.100 --> 1:30:08.300
 And it's just, you know, it's a scoby,

1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:10.860
 a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast

1:30:10.860 --> 1:30:14.500
 that you brew tea, you add sugar to it,

1:30:14.500 --> 1:30:16.780
 and you put the scoby in and you wait a week or two,

1:30:16.780 --> 1:30:18.240
 depending upon the temperature.

1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:22.880
 And then you just move the scoby over to a new batch

1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:24.020
 and you're old.

1:30:24.020 --> 1:30:26.540
 What the scoby was in is kombucha and it's wonderful.

1:30:26.540 --> 1:30:27.380
 I love it.

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:28.660
 I would love it if members of this audience

1:30:28.660 --> 1:30:31.220
 would start to make their own kombucha and sauerkraut.

1:30:31.220 --> 1:30:33.220
 I've been having so much fun.

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:37.260
 I don't do it, but you know, it's done in our home.

1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:39.480
 I don't go anywhere near the food production

1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:41.120
 and it's for everyone's benefit.

1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:46.300
 So how much fermented food and then were they consuming?

1:30:46.300 --> 1:30:48.100
 And, cause you mentioned the number of grams,

1:30:48.100 --> 1:30:49.780
 approximately, of fiber,

1:30:50.940 --> 1:30:54.140
 but was it in servings, ounces,

1:30:54.140 --> 1:30:56.420
 how many times a day, early day, late day?

1:30:56.420 --> 1:31:00.780
 Right, yeah, so we had a wonderful dietician

1:31:00.780 --> 1:31:03.660
 instructing people for this and her name's Dahlia Perlman

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.460
 and she really was the key and is the key

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:06.880
 for many of our studies for getting people

1:31:06.880 --> 1:31:08.180
 to eat differently.

1:31:08.180 --> 1:31:11.840
 And the general instructions were for people

1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:14.820
 to eat as much fermented foods as possible, more is better.

1:31:14.820 --> 1:31:18.080
 And the reason is that with this initial study,

1:31:18.080 --> 1:31:21.260
 we really wanted to maximize our chance of seeing a signal

1:31:21.260 --> 1:31:23.880
 if there was something biological going on,

1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:27.660
 with the idea that if the dose was excessive

1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:30.260
 and not easily achievable by a lot of people in the end,

1:31:30.260 --> 1:31:33.040
 we can go back and say, okay, this is the point

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:35.260
 at which we lose the biological signal.

1:31:35.260 --> 1:31:38.660
 But people during the height of the intervention phase,

1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:40.820
 the intervention phase was six weeks,

1:31:40.820 --> 1:31:44.180
 during the height of that, we're up over six servings

1:31:44.180 --> 1:31:46.260
 on average per day of fermented foods.

1:31:46.260 --> 1:31:48.620
 So kind of two servings at each meal

1:31:48.620 --> 1:31:52.560
 and the ounces or weight or size,

1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:55.220
 it really depended on what the fermented food was.

1:31:55.220 --> 1:31:56.620
 And we just told them to stick

1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:59.780
 to what was a recommended dose on the package

1:31:59.780 --> 1:32:01.660
 that they were buying.

1:32:01.660 --> 1:32:03.580
 You know, for kombucha, it'd be like a six

1:32:03.580 --> 1:32:06.760
 to eight ounce glass sauerkraut, like a half cup

1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:08.680
 or something like that and the same with yogurt.

1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:12.500
 Great, so what were the results?

1:32:12.500 --> 1:32:17.140
 Yeah, so the results astounded us in a way,

1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:21.140
 but then thinking more deeply and it'll be evident

1:32:21.140 --> 1:32:24.660
 even after I explain it in the context of this conversation,

1:32:24.660 --> 1:32:27.720
 likely why we saw the results we saw.

1:32:27.720 --> 1:32:31.380
 The results were astounding because our hypothesis

1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:33.940
 going into this was that the high fiber diet

1:32:33.940 --> 1:32:35.580
 was going to give the massive signal.

1:32:35.580 --> 1:32:37.160
 We know that this is the big deficiency

1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:38.220
 in the Western diet.

1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:41.580
 All the mouse studies have told us

1:32:41.580 --> 1:32:44.300
 that high fiber really leads to a much healthier microbiota,

1:32:44.300 --> 1:32:47.100
 can lead to positive changes in the immune system.

1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:49.180
 And in fact, even when we had a limited,

1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:50.460
 we had wonderful donor support,

1:32:50.460 --> 1:32:51.780
 but still a limited amount of money

1:32:51.780 --> 1:32:53.780
 when we started this study.

1:32:53.780 --> 1:32:57.140
 My lab was really very eager to do the high fiber

1:32:58.580 --> 1:33:00.300
 part of this really well.

1:33:00.300 --> 1:33:02.580
 And Christopher kind of had to twist our arms

1:33:02.580 --> 1:33:04.660
 to do the fermented food side of it.

1:33:04.660 --> 1:33:07.360
 And we thought it was kind of quirky and neat,

1:33:07.360 --> 1:33:10.900
 like live microbes should be exciting, like let's try it.

1:33:10.900 --> 1:33:12.940
 So we put that in and it turns out

1:33:12.940 --> 1:33:15.560
 that we were very thankful that he twisted our arms

1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:18.460
 because it was that high fermented food arm

1:33:18.460 --> 1:33:20.140
 that really gave us the big signal.

1:33:20.140 --> 1:33:22.900
 Even though our hypothesis was that the high fiber

1:33:22.900 --> 1:33:25.120
 was gonna lead to more short chain fatty acids

1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:29.180
 produced in the gut, more diverse microbiota,

1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:31.420
 less inflammation in the immune system,

1:33:31.420 --> 1:33:33.500
 we didn't see that across the cohort.

1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:37.060
 We actually saw very individualized responses

1:33:37.060 --> 1:33:38.520
 to the dietary fiber.

1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:40.780
 And I'll come back to what those responses were.

1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:44.200
 The big signal really was in the fermented food group.

1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:46.900
 We saw all the things that you would hope to see

1:33:46.900 --> 1:33:49.820
 in a Western microbiota and Western human.

1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:52.420
 We saw this increase in microbiota diversity

1:33:52.420 --> 1:33:53.700
 over the course of the six weeks

1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:56.300
 while they were consuming the fermented foods.

1:33:56.300 --> 1:34:01.300
 And we can't always say that higher diversity is better

1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:03.340
 when it comes to our microbial communities.

1:34:03.340 --> 1:34:05.040
 We know there are cases, for instance,

1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:07.180
 bacterial vaginosis where higher diversity

1:34:07.180 --> 1:34:10.340
 is actually indicative of a disease state.

1:34:10.340 --> 1:34:13.620
 But we know in the context of the gut

1:34:13.620 --> 1:34:16.900
 and for people living in the industrialized world,

1:34:16.900 --> 1:34:19.700
 higher diversity is generally better.

1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:21.420
 We know that there's a spectrum of diversity.

1:34:21.420 --> 1:34:24.540
 People with higher diversity generally are healthier.

1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:26.180
 If you can push your diversity higher,

1:34:26.180 --> 1:34:27.340
 you're in better shape.

1:34:27.340 --> 1:34:29.660
 And so we saw that increase in diversity.

1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:31.420
 And then the major question is what happened

1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:33.340
 to the immune system as these people

1:34:33.340 --> 1:34:35.660
 were increasing their gut microbiota diversity

1:34:35.660 --> 1:34:37.100
 through the fermented foods.

1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:41.500
 So we did this massive immune profiling

1:34:41.500 --> 1:34:45.060
 and we see a couple dozen immune markers,

1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:48.980
 inflammatory markers decrease over the course of the study.

1:34:48.980 --> 1:34:51.980
 So we measure these at multiple time points

1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:52.980
 throughout the course of the study.

1:34:52.980 --> 1:34:55.820
 And there's kind of this stepwise reduction

1:34:55.820 --> 1:35:00.220
 in things like interleukin-6 and interleukin-12,

1:35:00.220 --> 1:35:03.820
 a variety of kind of famous inflammatory mediators.

1:35:03.820 --> 1:35:06.300
 And then even if you go into the immune cells

1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:08.820
 and you start looking at their signaling cascades,

1:35:08.820 --> 1:35:10.500
 we see that those signaling cascades

1:35:10.500 --> 1:35:13.080
 are less activated at the end of the study

1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:14.860
 compared to the beginning of the study

1:35:14.860 --> 1:35:17.020
 indicating an attenuation of inflammation.

1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:20.660
 So kind of exactly what we would hypothesize

1:35:20.660 --> 1:35:22.460
 would lead to less propensity

1:35:22.460 --> 1:35:24.780
 for inflammatory disease over time.

1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:28.380
 That's a huge extension of a very short study.

1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:29.460
 How long was this study again?

1:35:29.460 --> 1:35:33.980
 So the complete protocol I think was 14 to 17 weeks

1:35:33.980 --> 1:35:35.100
 or something like that.

1:35:35.100 --> 1:35:38.900
 The actual intervention phase consisted of a four-week ramp

1:35:38.900 --> 1:35:41.320
 and then a six-week maintenance period.

1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:43.220
 So the intervention itself was 10 weeks,

1:35:43.220 --> 1:35:45.220
 but there were six weeks of really kind of

1:35:45.220 --> 1:35:48.820
 hardcore high levels of fiber or fermented foods.

1:35:48.820 --> 1:35:51.220
 Yeah, and I'm glad you mentioned the ramp

1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:53.860
 because my experience with fermented foods

1:35:53.860 --> 1:35:56.600
 is that it can be beneficial to give the system

1:35:56.600 --> 1:35:57.780
 an opportunity to acclimate.

1:35:57.780 --> 1:36:01.100
 I mean, if you consume a giant bowl of sauerkraut,

1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:03.100
 it's not going to be the worst day and night of your life,

1:36:03.100 --> 1:36:05.540
 but you'll know you did.

1:36:05.540 --> 1:36:06.520
 We'll just leave it at that.

1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:08.740
 And so you want to kind of acclimate to it.

1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:11.360
 I'm at the point now where some people

1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:12.260
 might think this is as gross,

1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:15.140
 but after I exercise, I've been sweating a lot.

1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:16.660
 I like the saltiness of the,

1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:20.100
 I actually drink the liquid that the sauerkraut

1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:21.980
 has been stewing in.

1:36:21.980 --> 1:36:24.380
 And I'd like to think that I consume

1:36:24.380 --> 1:36:26.780
 some fermentation that way.

1:36:26.780 --> 1:36:30.860
 It's salty, it acts as kind of a post-training replenishment.

1:36:30.860 --> 1:36:34.460
 But if I had done that six months ago straight off,

1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:36.340
 I think it would have been pretty rough on my system.

1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:37.940
 I started taking little bits of it

1:36:37.940 --> 1:36:39.100
 and then adding it each day.

1:36:39.100 --> 1:36:41.580
 Totally, and so both with the fermented foods and the fiber,

1:36:41.580 --> 1:36:44.420
 it's well known that this kind of gradual ramping

1:36:44.420 --> 1:36:48.080
 is a really important way of mitigating bloating

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:50.360
 and other kind of digestive discomfort

1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:52.700
 that can happen when your microbiome reconfigures

1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:55.580
 and starts fermenting more and changing community members.

1:36:55.580 --> 1:36:58.640
 So you should take that ramp at your own pace.

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:00.220
 If something seems to be going wrong,

1:37:00.220 --> 1:37:01.620
 just kind of level off, stay there.

1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:03.500
 You know, we did this in a very delicate way

1:37:03.500 --> 1:37:05.140
 to get people up to the high dose.

1:37:05.140 --> 1:37:10.140
 The brine question, just a tangent here for a second.

1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:12.580
 That was actually one of the products

1:37:12.580 --> 1:37:16.780
 that we had people use in the fermented food phase.

1:37:16.780 --> 1:37:18.580
 There's actually a product called Gut Shots,

1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:21.960
 which is just the brine that they've marketed.

1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:24.420
 We actually are now studying it in the lab.

1:37:24.420 --> 1:37:27.300
 I just actually, before this came from a lab meeting

1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:31.300
 where a GI fellow in my lab is actually putting Gut Shots,

1:37:31.300 --> 1:37:35.300
 sterilized gut microbes or the fermentation microbes

1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:42.100
 removed or present into mice and looking at changes

1:37:42.100 --> 1:37:44.300
 in their mucosal immune system.

1:37:44.300 --> 1:37:46.100
 So we're studying this in detail now

1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:48.820
 because it's a rich source of lactate

1:37:48.820 --> 1:37:51.100
 and a bunch of other interesting metabolites.

1:37:51.100 --> 1:37:52.460
 I love that my weird behavior

1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:56.500
 is inadvertently being studied at Stanford Medicine.

1:37:56.500 --> 1:37:59.380
 I want to just mention something about the Gut Shots.

1:37:59.380 --> 1:38:02.100
 Those are sold as a drink.

1:38:02.100 --> 1:38:03.860
 Those also, just for certain listeners

1:38:03.860 --> 1:38:05.800
 in different budgets, they can be very expensive

1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:06.740
 if you really think about,

1:38:06.740 --> 1:38:08.760
 some of them are exceedingly expensive,

1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:10.220
 but what I described before

1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:14.260
 with making your own kombucha is not quite brining,

1:38:14.260 --> 1:38:17.980
 but the homemade sauerkraut, that protocol is out there

1:38:17.980 --> 1:38:20.860
 as I mentioned in Tim's book, The 4-Hour Chef,

1:38:20.860 --> 1:38:23.580
 and you get a lot of the brining from that,

1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:24.820
 an almost endless amount.

1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:28.480
 A cautionary note, I once went into the refrigerator

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:31.300
 and saw something similar to Gut Shot, it wasn't Gut Shot,

1:38:31.300 --> 1:38:33.860
 and I drank the whole 12-ounce bottle

1:38:33.860 --> 1:38:36.180
 and realized that it was 24 servings.

1:38:36.180 --> 1:38:39.340
 And that's where I got my initial experience

1:38:39.340 --> 1:38:41.340
 with what it is to not do a ramp-up phase.

1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:43.140
 I do not recommend doing that.

1:38:43.140 --> 1:38:45.380
 Some of these, it's very potent, it seems,

1:38:45.380 --> 1:38:47.900
 and you can consume even a half an ounce or an ounce.

1:38:47.900 --> 1:38:48.720
 It's quite-

1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:51.020
 I mean, very potent from the standpoint of fermentation,

1:38:51.020 --> 1:38:52.100
 but also very salty.

1:38:52.100 --> 1:38:55.060
 So there's a lot of effects that can-

1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:58.300
 Don't do what I do, at least not at the outset.

1:38:59.420 --> 1:39:02.940
 But so that is an experienced warning.

1:39:02.940 --> 1:39:04.380
 So they did this, as I recall,

1:39:04.380 --> 1:39:06.960
 there was a swap condition or there was a halt condition.

1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.740
 So you did controls, right?

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:10.060
 It wasn't just comparing groups.

1:39:10.060 --> 1:39:13.020
 You had individuals who were initially in one group

1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:16.140
 or the other move to a different group.

1:39:16.140 --> 1:39:18.660
 Or to stop and then return.

1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:20.580
 Yeah, we actually just did a stop

1:39:20.580 --> 1:39:22.260
 and followed them during a washout phase.

1:39:22.260 --> 1:39:26.900
 And the ideal situation for dietary interventions like this

1:39:26.900 --> 1:39:30.100
 are to do crossover studies, as you're suggesting.

1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:32.540
 We've recently completed a ketogenic

1:39:32.540 --> 1:39:34.380
 versus Mediterranean diet intervention.

1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:35.860
 Were those data published yet?

1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:37.360
 Not yet, but Christopher has been tweeting

1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:38.880
 a lot of these data and there's a paper

1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:39.740
 in revision right now.

1:39:39.740 --> 1:39:43.180
 So if you go to Christopher Gardner's Twitter feed,

1:39:43.180 --> 1:39:45.740
 you'll be able to find him reporting

1:39:45.740 --> 1:39:48.420
 some of the early results of this study.

1:39:48.420 --> 1:39:50.560
 Can you give us a snippet of, was there a superior-

1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:52.640
 Just give us a, you don't have to tell us which one,

1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:55.780
 but was there a superior condition

1:39:55.780 --> 1:39:57.740
 of either Mediterranean versus ketogenic?

1:39:57.740 --> 1:40:02.460
 So the metabolic effects of these, it's a beautiful study.

1:40:02.460 --> 1:40:04.380
 I should let his group comment on that.

1:40:04.380 --> 1:40:07.240
 The microbiota data we actually are just generating now.

1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:10.900
 So the study that his group has put together from this

1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:14.260
 is largely independent of the microbiota data.

1:40:14.260 --> 1:40:16.100
 And now we're doing a more in-depth analysis

1:40:16.100 --> 1:40:17.940
 and I'll have more to say about that in the future.

1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:19.380
 But that- We'll return to that, yeah.

1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:20.660
 But it's a super exciting study

1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:24.440
 because it is one of these where people eat a certain way.

1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:26.300
 And what's really beautiful about this

1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:29.620
 is we even got food delivered for part of the intervention.

1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:32.540
 So we had complete control over what they

1:40:32.540 --> 1:40:34.380
 at least had available to eat.

1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:39.380
 And then the second phase, they make the food on their own.

1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:43.540
 And then we cross over and do the same thing.

1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:45.500
 And so that's really like the,

1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:47.060
 if you have a good enough budget,

1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:48.220
 the right way to do a study like this.

1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:51.680
 For this, we didn't have the time or money

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:54.420
 to do a crossover, but we did do a washout phase

1:40:54.420 --> 1:40:57.540
 where people, we didn't make them stop eating whatever

1:40:57.540 --> 1:40:59.300
 if they were enjoying it, but we monitored

1:40:59.300 --> 1:41:01.580
 and there was some recidivism where there was a decrease

1:41:01.580 --> 1:41:03.040
 in fiber fermented food.

1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:04.780
 And we could see, for instance,

1:41:04.780 --> 1:41:06.820
 diversity start to plateau in reverse

1:41:06.820 --> 1:41:08.060
 in many of these people.

1:41:08.060 --> 1:41:10.500
 So there does appear to be like a need

1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:12.880
 for maintenance of the intervention

1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:15.940
 to maintain the perceived health benefits

1:41:15.940 --> 1:41:17.180
 that we were measuring.

1:41:17.180 --> 1:41:18.020
 Great.

1:41:18.020 --> 1:41:20.200
 We will provide a link to the study in the caption.

1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:23.820
 And thank you for that very clear and thorough description

1:41:23.820 --> 1:41:27.580
 from one of the investigators involved in the study.

1:41:27.580 --> 1:41:29.460
 It's great to go direct to the source.

1:41:29.460 --> 1:41:34.460
 So anecdotally, were there improvements in mood,

1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:38.420
 in resistance to colds and infection

1:41:38.420 --> 1:41:39.820
 during the course of the study?

1:41:39.820 --> 1:41:43.140
 And this is kind of a prelude to where I'm headed next,

1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:45.280
 which is there is a tremendous amount of interest

1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:46.620
 in the so-called gut brain access,

1:41:46.620 --> 1:41:49.220
 but also I want to make sure that we talk about

1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:52.260
 how these microbes and the conditions they're establishing

1:41:52.260 --> 1:41:55.880
 in the gut are creating positive or negative health effects.

1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:58.260
 I mean, actually basically how signals get out of the gut.

1:41:58.260 --> 1:41:59.140
 Totally.

1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:00.980
 So did people, I certainly noticed

1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:02.620
 that when I'm eating more fermented foods

1:42:02.620 --> 1:42:05.540
 or there's probiotics in drinks I consume and so forth,

1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:08.020
 that I feel, quote unquote, air quotes,

1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:09.820
 completely subjective, I feel better.

1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:11.220
 Yeah.

1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:14.700
 I wish there was an objective measure of feeling better,

1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:19.020
 but I seem to think more clearly, sleep better,

1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:21.500
 mood, et cetera, and I know I'm not alone in that.

1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:25.240
 And people, and anytime I've taken harsh antibiotics,

1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:27.060
 I feel worse, but then again, I'm usually taking them

1:42:27.060 --> 1:42:29.060
 because I'm feeling bad about something else, right?

1:42:29.060 --> 1:42:30.700
 I don't take them just because.

1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:33.540
 So did people say they were feeling better in any way?

1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:34.960
 And if so, what did you observe?

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:38.100
 And again, we're highlighting these as anic data.

1:42:38.100 --> 1:42:39.100
 Yeah, totally.

1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:43.100
 You know, we, as part of this effort

1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:48.100
 to look at how dietary interventions affect our health

1:42:48.180 --> 1:42:51.580
 and wellbeing and so forth and microbiome and immune system,

1:42:51.580 --> 1:42:55.860
 we interact with a lot of people who have like read our book

1:42:55.860 --> 1:42:59.620
 or kind of have become microbiome enthusiasts

1:42:59.620 --> 1:43:01.860
 and have implemented a lot of these changes

1:43:01.860 --> 1:43:02.700
 in their personal life.

1:43:02.700 --> 1:43:04.860
 And I hear the same thing that you're saying, Andrew,

1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:07.660
 that tons of people say they have more energy,

1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:09.760
 they think more clearly, they sleep better,

1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:11.840
 their family is nicer to each other,

1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:13.660
 like the number of crazy things.

1:43:13.660 --> 1:43:15.580
 And it's really hard to uncouple like,

1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:18.580
 is this because these people have taken charge now

1:43:18.580 --> 1:43:20.460
 of what they're eating and just feel better in general

1:43:20.460 --> 1:43:23.220
 for being in control of kind of what they're doing?

1:43:23.220 --> 1:43:26.700
 Or is there this cascading set of effects

1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:31.040
 that are actually impacting or kind of emanating

1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:32.400
 from the gut brain axis?

1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:36.780
 And so we actually implemented a bunch of questionnaires

1:43:36.780 --> 1:43:40.540
 and even a cognitive test to try to get at some of this.

1:43:40.540 --> 1:43:44.020
 And I should say, the list of this goes on and on.

1:43:44.020 --> 1:43:46.300
 There are people who claim that their complexion improves

1:43:46.300 --> 1:43:48.100
 and that their allergies,

1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:50.280
 and there's probably all sorts of ripple effects.

1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:52.860
 If you can affect your inflammation,

1:43:52.860 --> 1:43:54.700
 we know that you can affect your cognition.

1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.960
 We know that you can affect your skin

1:43:57.960 --> 1:43:59.980
 and inflammation that's occurring on your skin.

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:02.800
 So I really think that there is a basis

1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:04.620
 for a lot of those anecdotes.

1:44:04.620 --> 1:44:07.780
 It may just be hard to see in a short study

1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:12.780
 and in a small cohort of people over a short period of time,

1:44:13.100 --> 1:44:17.380
 but we didn't really see significant things

1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:19.940
 associated with cognition and moods

1:44:19.940 --> 1:44:24.060
 and all of the things that we were testing for,

1:44:24.060 --> 1:44:26.500
 which yeah, there could be a variety

1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:28.020
 of explanations for that.

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:33.020
 We also have a standardized stool measure that people use,

1:44:34.660 --> 1:44:38.140
 and there was kind of less constipation,

1:44:38.140 --> 1:44:40.180
 better bowel movements over the course

1:44:40.180 --> 1:44:41.300
 of both of these interventions.

1:44:41.300 --> 1:44:44.220
 So it did seem like bowel habits improved,

1:44:44.220 --> 1:44:46.780
 which a lot of times can lead to better moods,

1:44:46.780 --> 1:44:49.120
 but that we weren't able to measure that.

1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:53.220
 The classic psychoanalyst would have a field day with that.

1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:55.760
 What sorts of interesting things did you observe

1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:56.600
 in the fiber group?

1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:59.000
 Because it's clear that that group yielded

1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:02.500
 some unexpected findings in both directions,

1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:03.460
 things you expected to see,

1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:05.720
 you didn't see as to the same amplitude

1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:07.220
 as you did in the fermented food group,

1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:09.760
 but I'm guessing you also saw some very interesting things

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:11.180
 in the fiber group.

1:45:11.180 --> 1:45:12.020
 Totally, yeah.

1:45:12.020 --> 1:45:14.820
 So we started looking at the data in more detail

1:45:14.820 --> 1:45:17.820
 when we didn't see the cohort-wide response.

1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:20.180
 And one of the things we observed is that

1:45:20.180 --> 1:45:22.020
 in measuring all these immune parameters,

1:45:22.020 --> 1:45:24.600
 there appeared to be three different groups

1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:28.160
 of kind of immune responses that we were seeing.

1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:31.220
 One group that got overall less inflammatory,

1:45:31.220 --> 1:45:34.580
 and then two other groups that kind of had a mixed result,

1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:37.100
 partly more inflammatory, partly less inflammatory

1:45:37.100 --> 1:45:39.100
 in all these markers that we were looking at.

1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:43.340
 And when we started digging into like what aspect

1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:48.340
 of the biology of those people dictated or predicted

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:50.900
 which group they fell into,

1:45:50.900 --> 1:45:52.620
 the really interesting part is the people

1:45:52.620 --> 1:45:55.240
 with the highest diversity gut microbiomes

1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:59.200
 to start the study were the ones that were most likely

1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:03.460
 to have the decreases in inflammation.

1:46:03.460 --> 1:46:08.260
 And so the data seemed to be telling us that

1:46:08.260 --> 1:46:10.460
 if you start off with a diverse microbiota,

1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:13.740
 maybe one that's better equipped to degrade

1:46:13.740 --> 1:46:16.660
 a wide variety of dietary fiber,

1:46:16.660 --> 1:46:18.940
 you're more likely to respond positively to it.

1:46:18.940 --> 1:46:21.420
 If you have a very depleted gut microbiome,

1:46:21.420 --> 1:46:23.420
 you're not as likely to be able to respond to it.

1:46:23.420 --> 1:46:24.940
 And thinking back to that experiment

1:46:24.940 --> 1:46:25.860
 that we talked about before

1:46:25.860 --> 1:46:28.380
 with the multi-generational loss

1:46:28.380 --> 1:46:31.100
 of fiber-fermenting microbes in mice

1:46:31.100 --> 1:46:34.300
 that were fed a Western diet,

1:46:34.300 --> 1:46:38.380
 it may be that many of us in the industrialized world

1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:40.980
 have a microbiome that's so depleted now

1:46:40.980 --> 1:46:43.940
 that even if we consume a high fiber diet,

1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:45.580
 at least for a short period of time,

1:46:45.580 --> 1:46:47.580
 we don't have the right microbes in our gut

1:46:47.580 --> 1:46:48.860
 to degrade that fiber.

1:46:48.860 --> 1:46:50.740
 And this has actually been observed by other groups,

1:46:50.740 --> 1:46:53.060
 beautiful study out of University of Minnesota

1:46:53.060 --> 1:46:55.880
 looking at immigrants coming to the United States.

1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:57.900
 And within nine months,

1:46:57.900 --> 1:46:59.960
 but certainly over the course of years,

1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:04.460
 immigrants that come here lose a lot of the diversity

1:47:04.460 --> 1:47:05.640
 in their gut microbiome,

1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:08.420
 but a lot of the fiber-degrading capacity

1:47:08.420 --> 1:47:09.260
 in their gut microbiome too.

1:47:09.260 --> 1:47:11.020
 So it could be that over time,

1:47:11.020 --> 1:47:12.920
 this becomes a one-way street

1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:16.160
 and it's hard for us to recover the microbes

1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:18.000
 that actually can degrade the fiber.

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.020
 And I think that this probably intersects with sanitation

1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:21.860
 in our environment

1:47:21.860 --> 1:47:25.260
 and the fact that we don't have access to new microbes

1:47:25.260 --> 1:47:27.180
 that might help us degrade the fiber,

1:47:27.180 --> 1:47:30.420
 that we actually have lost these microbes

1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:32.780
 and they're in some ways irrecoverable

1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:34.440
 without deliberate reintroduction

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:35.840
 of fiber-degrading microbes.

1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:36.940
 I can recall from childhood,

1:47:36.940 --> 1:47:40.540
 there were kids that would eat dirt and snails

1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:42.540
 and stuff that just sounds totally disgusting,

1:47:42.540 --> 1:47:44.140
 but kids covered with mud

1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:47.740
 and that maybe not so much anymore.

1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:49.260
 And certainly during the pandemic,

1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:52.140
 there's been a lot more use of these hand sanitizers

1:47:52.140 --> 1:47:54.380
 that prior to that, people seemed pretty spooked about,

1:47:54.380 --> 1:47:57.500
 but then obviously they prioritize them.

1:47:57.500 --> 1:48:00.420
 So do you, while you have children,

1:48:00.420 --> 1:48:02.900
 do you encourage them to,

1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:05.700
 when they were young, did you encourage them to interact

1:48:05.700 --> 1:48:09.900
 with pets and dirt and stuff in the environment,

1:48:09.900 --> 1:48:12.020
 provided that stuff wasn't immediately toxic?

1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:12.860
 Exactly.

1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:13.700
 So this is really,

1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:17.340
 it's a continual cost benefit analysis.

1:48:17.340 --> 1:48:22.200
 I think I will say that with the pandemic now

1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:25.700
 and certainly just with infectious diseases in general,

1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:30.620
 it's really important to be aware of the possibility

1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:33.260
 for compromising your health through the spread of germs.

1:48:33.260 --> 1:48:36.020
 And so that is just, hand-washing is important

1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:40.260
 and we have to be careful with the spread of germs.

1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:45.260
 But I do think that the sanitization of our environment

1:48:47.500 --> 1:48:52.380
 has gone overboard with various things being impregnated

1:48:52.380 --> 1:48:55.740
 with antibiotics, shopping carts and things like that

1:48:55.740 --> 1:48:57.100
 and toothbrushes.

1:48:57.100 --> 1:49:02.100
 And it's like antibiotics and things for killing microbes

1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:03.960
 are everywhere.

1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:08.100
 And when we were raising, when our daughters were young

1:49:08.100 --> 1:49:10.280
 and we were making these decisions,

1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:14.100
 the calculations that we would make were really one,

1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:19.060
 how likely are they to encounter a disease-causing microbe?

1:49:19.060 --> 1:49:22.660
 If we've been out on a hike or in our garden,

1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:24.860
 just kind of working in the dirt or whatever,

1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:26.860
 maybe it's not as important to wash your hands

1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:27.760
 before you have lunch,

1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:29.840
 even if there's a little bit of dirt on them.

1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:31.460
 If they've been in a public playground

1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:34.660
 where maybe there's other kids with germs

1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:37.180
 or maybe even chemicals like pesticides

1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:39.300
 and herbicides that are being used,

1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:42.780
 maybe it's more important than to wash your hands.

1:49:42.780 --> 1:49:44.660
 Certainly if you've been in the grocery store

1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:47.800
 or on the subway, probably a good idea to wash your hands.

1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:49.400
 So I think you really need to think about

1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:50.940
 kind of the context of it.

1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:55.940
 And exposure to microbes from the environment

1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:59.880
 is likely an important part of educating our immune system

1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:01.880
 and keeping the proper balance in our immune system.

1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:03.660
 And it's just a matter of figuring out

1:50:03.660 --> 1:50:05.360
 the right way to do that safely.

1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:07.920
 And it may be that the fermented food result that we saw

1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:10.160
 is a way of tapping into those same pathways,

1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.120
 kind of an environmental exposure to microbes that's safe.

1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:14.500
 Interesting.

1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:17.680
 I'd like to touch on how signals get from the gut

1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:18.760
 to the rest of the body.

1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:22.440
 And we probably don't have time to go into all the systems

1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:24.720
 that benefit from having a diverse microbiome

1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:26.320
 or a healthy microbiome,

1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:28.900
 but we talked about the immune system.

1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:32.960
 There's active signaling and transport from the gut

1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:34.620
 all along its length, as far as I know,

1:50:34.620 --> 1:50:37.040
 into the bloodstream and to other organs and tissues.

1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:41.620
 So for the immune system, it seems straightforward.

1:50:41.620 --> 1:50:43.820
 You could reduce the amount or number

1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:46.520
 of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and so forth,

1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:49.080
 maybe increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines

1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:51.640
 like IL-10 and others.

1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:54.080
 But we know there's a gut-brain axis of neurons

1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:55.860
 that literally talk in both directions

1:50:55.860 --> 1:50:57.160
 between brain and gut.

1:50:57.160 --> 1:50:59.840
 But let's say I'm eating my fermented foods,

1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:03.340
 I'm doing all the right things and my gut is diverse

1:51:03.340 --> 1:51:06.420
 and I have all the goodies at all the right places.

1:51:06.420 --> 1:51:11.420
 How is it that the fact that those microbiota are thriving

1:51:11.820 --> 1:51:14.840
 is conveyed to the rest of the body?

1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:16.240
 Because they're in there doing their thing

1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:17.980
 and I don't know that they have a mind,

1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:19.940
 but they're probably not thinking of taking care of me,

1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:22.480
 Andrew, but I get feel better

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:25.080
 or I might get sick less often

1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:27.920
 or combat any illness more quickly.

1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:29.740
 How is that actually happening?

1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:32.320
 I mean, is it that the microbiota stay restricted

1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:35.300
 to the gut, but the signaling molecules

1:51:35.300 --> 1:51:38.440
 are all in a downstream way

1:51:38.440 --> 1:51:40.600
 are making good or bad things happen?

1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:43.440
 Or is there some sort of direct recognition

1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:45.840
 at the body level or are there cells in the body

1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:48.640
 that are responding to, ah, the gut microbiome is healthy

1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:51.520
 and therefore I can make more of the good stuff

1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:53.280
 and less of the bad stuff, so to speak.

1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:54.600
 Yeah, great.

1:51:56.140 --> 1:51:57.480
 You're right, it's super complex.

1:51:57.480 --> 1:52:02.200
 There's a huge array of ways that our body perceives

1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:05.400
 both the microbes and the molecules that they produce

1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:07.280
 in our gut and the molecules they produce

1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:09.420
 are of course a product of what microbes are there

1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:12.360
 and then what they receive as kind of metabolic inputs,

1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:15.060
 what we're eating and what other microbes are present

1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:17.600
 in the environment providing molecules to them.

1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:19.520
 So, you know, it's this complex matrix,

1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:24.040
 but probably the simplest place to start

1:52:24.040 --> 1:52:25.260
 is just the immune system.

1:52:25.260 --> 1:52:29.400
 We have an immune system that the vast majority

1:52:29.400 --> 1:52:31.760
 of immune cells in our body are located in our gut

1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:35.200
 just because there's such a dense population

1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:36.700
 of microbes there that have,

1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:41.440
 we consider them beneficial microbes,

1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:43.640
 but they're only beneficial if they're in the right spot

1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:44.460
 in the gut.

1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:45.800
 As soon as they mislocalize,

1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:48.760
 we know that they can become opportunistic pathogens.

1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:51.840
 And so the immune system really playing an important role

1:52:51.840 --> 1:52:56.280
 to keep them in place is essential for the system

1:52:56.280 --> 1:52:58.960
 not moving into a disease space.

1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:01.160
 The immune system has a variety of ways

1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.160
 of monitoring what microbes are there.

1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:06.160
 There are actually specialized structures in the gut

1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:10.860
 known as Peyer's patches that actually take up microbes.

1:53:10.860 --> 1:53:14.360
 They actually allow microbes to transit

1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:19.120
 into this population of immune cells

1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:20.760
 in a very controlled way

1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:23.720
 so that that set of immune cells becomes educated

1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:26.040
 as to what microbes are just on the other side

1:53:26.040 --> 1:53:26.880
 of the barrier.

1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:28.880
 Wow, it's kind of like a border patrol.

1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:29.880
 Exactly, yeah.

1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:33.420
 So they bring them in, they fingerprint them,

1:53:33.420 --> 1:53:38.420
 and then have kind of this set of responses

1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:41.360
 ready to go if needed.

1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:42.360
 Amazing.

1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.960
 There are other cells known as dendritic cells,

1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:48.760
 special types that actually send long arms,

1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:51.640
 these processes out into the lumen of the gut

1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:53.060
 and do the same thing.

1:53:53.060 --> 1:53:56.120
 Take up microbes, bring them back in and sample them.

1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:59.160
 In addition to these direct sampling mechanisms,

1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:03.040
 the cells that line the gut have a huge array of receptors,

1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:06.760
 specialized proteins that perceive patterns

1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:10.120
 that the molecular patterns that the microbes make.

1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:13.600
 So things like endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide,

1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:16.720
 just the cell wall of the bacteria.

1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:19.580
 We have specialized receptors that recognize those.

1:54:19.580 --> 1:54:21.760
 If those signals become too profound

1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:24.660
 or if they're perceived in the wrong place,

1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:26.760
 that can stimulate an inflammatory response.

1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:29.000
 So there's all these ways of kind of monitoring

1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.080
 the membership and where it is and how close it is.

1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:35.760
 But then there's this whole other set of ways

1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:37.920
 of perceiving metabolic activity

1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:38.760
 and what's happening in the gut.

1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:41.880
 And you mentioned before this direct,

1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:46.200
 these cell types that express taste receptors in the gut

1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:48.980
 and have ways of sampling dietary components.

1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:53.980
 They're those same types of analogous cells in our gut

1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:58.600
 that are perceiving metabolites produced by the microbiota

1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:00.600
 so that our bodies can perceive

1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:03.360
 what sort of metabolic activity is going on.

1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.780
 And then in addition to that,

1:55:05.780 --> 1:55:10.600
 there's this tremendously important enteric nervous system

1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:13.220
 that's sending signals back to the brain,

1:55:13.220 --> 1:55:15.660
 dictating things like motility.

1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:17.120
 Do I get rid of what's in here?

1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:18.480
 Do I move it along quickly?

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:20.680
 What actually is happening?

1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:23.200
 Do I need to interact with immune cells?

1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:27.080
 So there's this really complex array of interactions

1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:28.460
 between the different cell types.

1:55:28.460 --> 1:55:31.780
 And then a lot of the cells that are in the gut

1:55:31.780 --> 1:55:33.320
 perceiving all of these signals,

1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:37.120
 a lot of the immune cells can actually get up and leave.

1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:39.560
 They can get into the blood cycle through

1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:44.360
 and then home to other regions of the mucosal surfaces

1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:48.480
 so that mucosal surfaces are educated broadly

1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:51.280
 against what's passing through our gut.

1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:55.860
 So there's a variety of ways of cells communicating.

1:55:55.860 --> 1:56:00.600
 And then a lot of the molecules that the microbiota makes

1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:04.100
 can actually make their way into the bloodstream directly.

1:56:04.100 --> 1:56:08.600
 And so the array of molecules is still being defined.

1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:11.520
 We're trying to figure out what all these chemicals are.

1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:13.280
 We've mentioned the short chain fatty acids,

1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:15.360
 but those are just the tip of the iceberg.

1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:17.220
 They're really interesting compounds

1:56:17.220 --> 1:56:21.760
 like indole derivatives and phenols

1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:26.480
 and derived from amino acids metabolized by gut microbes

1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:28.200
 taken up into the bloodstream.

1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:30.440
 And then we further metabolize these.

1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:34.080
 They become kind of co-microbe host metabolites,

1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:37.180
 and then they can go on and bind to different receptors

1:56:37.180 --> 1:56:40.360
 throughout our body, anywhere our bloodstream has access to

1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.360
 and start to trigger signaling cascades.

1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:45.400
 Is it known whether or not any of those molecules

1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:47.960
 are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier?

1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:51.720
 Because the hypothesis and the current thinking

1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:55.560
 is that neurotransmitters manufactured in the gut

1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:57.720
 and signaling along the gut-brain axis,

1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:00.560
 literally neurons talking back and forth electrically

1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:02.440
 from brain to gut and gut to brain

1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:04.160
 is what regulates things like mood

1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:05.360
 or at least in animal models.

1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:07.900
 And there are some emerging human studies improvement

1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:11.400
 of symptoms in autism spectrum disorders,

1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:12.840
 maybe even in ADHD.

1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:15.920
 What I'm basically saying here is there is some evidence

1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:18.160
 emerging that improving the gut microbiome

1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:20.600
 can improve outcomes in psychiatric

1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:22.320
 and developmental disorders.

1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:26.140
 But what you're telling me is that the microbiota themselves

1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:27.880
 are manufacturing chemicals that can make it

1:57:27.880 --> 1:57:30.000
 into the bloodstream, and therefore I'm asking

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:31.880
 if those chemicals can move from the bloodstream

1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:33.400
 into the brain directly.

1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:37.360
 It may not be a gut-brain axis via neurons.

1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:39.760
 It actually could just be seepage of serotonin

1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:42.800
 into the brain or acetylcholine into the brain

1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:43.680
 for that matter.

1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:44.520
 Totally, yeah.

1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:49.520
 And the biology of most of these molecules

1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:53.260
 is not well understood, but certainly in like

1:57:53.260 --> 1:57:56.640
 cerebrospinal fluid that's been analyzed,

1:57:56.640 --> 1:57:59.560
 you can perceive these microbial metabolites.

1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:00.400
 So they are there.

1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:01.220
 That's the answer.

1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:03.400
 Some of them are getting across the barrier.

1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:05.960
 But so really interesting thing is I think a lot

1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:10.280
 of these molecules are, if they're experienced

1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:14.400
 at high enough doses, are toxic or have toxic properties.

1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:17.640
 We know that a lot of these metabolites

1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:19.400
 when they make their way into the bloodstream

1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:21.800
 eventually are excreted through the kidneys and urine.

1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:23.880
 So actually we can monitor the metabolism

1:58:23.880 --> 1:58:26.280
 that's going on in your gut by actually looking

1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:28.260
 at the metabolites that are present in your urine

1:58:28.260 --> 1:58:31.720
 because many of those originated in your gut

1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:33.080
 from your gut microbes.

1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:36.680
 But people with kidney disease whose kidneys

1:58:36.680 --> 1:58:39.280
 filtering processes not functioning properly

1:58:39.280 --> 1:58:44.000
 actually build up high levels of many of these metabolites

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:48.800
 into the bloodstream, and that can lead

1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:50.960
 to more of these molecules making it

1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.760
 across the blood-brain barrier.

1:58:52.760 --> 1:58:56.060
 And in fact, some of the transporters in the kidney

1:58:56.060 --> 1:58:58.420
 that are responsible for shuttling these molecules

1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:01.840
 out into urine are also found at the blood-brain barrier

1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:04.560
 for shuttling the molecules back into the bloodstream

1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:06.240
 if they do get across.

1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:09.080
 And we know that like mental fog is a big,

1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:12.160
 one of the big symptoms of kidney disease

1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:15.120
 potentially because a lot of these metabolites

1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:17.700
 accumulate in blood and then make their way

1:59:17.700 --> 1:59:20.060
 across the blood-brain barrier into, yeah,

1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:21.360
 the central nervous system.

1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:22.200
 Amazing.

1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:23.160
 I'm glad you mentioned mental fog.

1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:25.880
 A few years back there were some reports,

1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:30.060
 some scientific reports and as a consequence in the media

1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:33.840
 that excessive intake of pill-form probiotics

1:59:33.840 --> 1:59:35.560
 could create mental fog.

1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:37.960
 I don't know if that ever took hold.

1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:42.040
 And it raises a general question about pill-form probiotics.

1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:43.860
 I took them for a few years just thinking

1:59:43.860 --> 1:59:45.480
 that would be good for my gut microbiome,

1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:47.320
 and then I switched to the fermented food thing

1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:50.080
 but largely as a consequence of the work

1:59:50.080 --> 1:59:51.660
 that you and Chris published.

1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:55.240
 But what's the thought about probiotics

1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:57.220
 for the typical person that's not recovering

1:59:57.220 --> 1:59:58.880
 from a round of antibiotics

1:59:58.880 --> 2:00:01.120
 or that has been prescribed them?

2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:06.360
 I've heard that the species of microbiota

2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:10.000
 that they proliferate might not be the species

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.320
 that we want to proliferate,

2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:13.380
 but I've also heard that maybe that doesn't matter.

2:00:13.380 --> 2:00:14.520
 So what's your general stance?

2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:16.840
 They can be quite expensive also.

2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:18.360
 I know I've been talking about expense law today,

2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:19.560
 but I always want to take into account

2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:21.480
 that people are showing up to the table

2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:23.940
 with a variety of budgets.

2:00:23.940 --> 2:00:26.400
 And probiotics are one of the more expensive

2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:27.240
 supplements out there.

2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:29.420
 You can quickly get into the several hundreds of dollars

2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:32.520
 per month if you're getting the quote unquote

2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:33.880
 best quality ones.

2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:35.760
 And if they're actually causing brain fog,

2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:37.840
 then I'm not sure I'd want to use them.

2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:38.680
 No, completely.

2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:39.960
 And there's a ton of snake oil out there.

2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:41.960
 I mean, there's just people know that they,

2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:45.800
 I think that many of these companies are aware

2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:47.440
 that they can pray off of people's fears

2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:49.000
 and get a lot of money from them

2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:50.640
 with absolutely no data to back up

2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:52.600
 that their probiotic is doing anything.

2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:56.640
 So I think the first thing to say is buyer beware

2:00:56.640 --> 2:00:58.320
 because it's a supplement market.

2:00:58.320 --> 2:00:59.960
 It's largely unregulated.

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:02.480
 And that means that there are a lot of bad products

2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:05.740
 out there and a lot of products that,

2:01:05.740 --> 2:01:07.580
 even though they're not intended to be bad,

2:01:07.580 --> 2:01:09.400
 just don't have great quality control.

2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:11.680
 There have been several studies that have taken

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.800
 off the, over the counter,

2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:15.680
 just kind of off the shelf probiotics.

2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:18.960
 Surveyed what's in there based on sequencing

2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:22.540
 and shown that they, what is in there

2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:24.300
 does not match what's on the label.

2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.140
 So that's-

2:01:25.140 --> 2:01:26.180
 And that's true of many supplements

2:01:26.180 --> 2:01:27.720
 and unfortunately supplement companies.

2:01:27.720 --> 2:01:29.880
 This is something we get into on the podcast a lot there.

2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:32.200
 There are reputable brands and they go through

2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:34.340
 a lot of work to get things right.

2:01:34.340 --> 2:01:37.840
 And there are many that just for whatever reason,

2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:39.200
 it just doesn't match what's listed.

2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:40.040
 Exactly.

2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:44.760
 And so there are places that probiotic companies

2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:48.240
 can send their product to have it independently validated.

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:50.960
 So you want to look for that sort of validation

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:52.480
 on a product.

2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:55.480
 There also are names that are just very well known

2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.660
 and it's,

2:02:00.540 --> 2:02:02.220
 their reputations are on the line.

2:02:02.220 --> 2:02:04.140
 So they probably invest a little bit more

2:02:04.140 --> 2:02:06.720
 in quality control than maybe some of the other

2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:08.520
 lesser known names.

2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:13.520
 But there's a huge range of data on probiotics

2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:18.160
 and I think the thing that we kind of recommend

2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:22.440
 is try to find good products and then experiment

2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:24.200
 for yourself and see if you can find something

2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:25.040
 that works for you.

2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:28.100
 I know people who have experienced constipation

2:02:28.100 --> 2:02:31.080
 and don't want to change their diet

2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:33.860
 and have found a probiotic that helps them with that.

2:02:33.860 --> 2:02:36.800
 If you can find that right mix, great.

2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:38.480
 That's wonderful.

2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:40.840
 I would say that the data right now

2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:45.840
 is not overwhelmingly positive for what probiotics

2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:48.560
 do to the gut microbiota.

2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:50.660
 So there have been some nice studies looking at

2:02:50.660 --> 2:02:52.960
 the impact of probiotics on recovery

2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:56.240
 after antibiotic treatment and it appears to slow down

2:02:56.240 --> 2:02:59.200
 the recovery of the mucosal microbiota.

2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:03.280
 And some other studies that have,

2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:07.440
 where the big signal isn't seen, as you might hope,

2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:09.360
 with a probiotic that's supposed to treat

2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:10.360
 a different disease.

2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:12.880
 There have been meta-analysis that do suggest

2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:17.040
 in certain instances recovery from antibiotics

2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:19.680
 that there, even though it may cause your microbiota

2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.040
 to recover more slowly, that it may actually prevent

2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:26.360
 diarrheal disease, recovery from viral diarrhea,

2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:27.440
 probiotics may help.

2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:30.000
 But because there's such a huge range of products

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:33.080
 and because each person is their own little caper

2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:35.640
 when it comes to the microbiome, it's really hard

2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:39.520
 to know whether there are great products

2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:41.060
 for a given indication.

2:03:41.060 --> 2:03:44.160
 The really good advice that I've heard is try to find

2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:50.240
 a study that supports in a really well-designed study,

2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:52.360
 and this is very hard for people who aren't scientists

2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:55.280
 to evaluate, but so if you're experiencing

2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.660
 a medical problem or wanna consult a doctor,

2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:01.920
 that might be helpful, but finding a study

2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:05.320
 where a specific probiotic has successfully done

2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:07.840
 whatever it is you're looking for and then sticking

2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:11.200
 with that probiotic is really the best recipe

2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:13.320
 as a place to start in this space, I think.

2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:14.520
 And what about prebiotics?

2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:17.520
 Is there a number of reasons why I can imagine

2:04:17.520 --> 2:04:20.240
 that prebiotics would be beneficial?

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:23.840
 Which essentially, you're pushing the fiber system,

2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:25.080
 which we talked a lot about today.

2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:26.440
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:33.400
 The studies that have been done on prebiotics,

2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:37.680
 it's really kind of a mixed bag of results.

2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:41.140
 There have been studies done with purified fibers

2:04:41.140 --> 2:04:43.720
 where you actually see microbiota diversity plummet

2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:46.500
 over the course of the study because you get

2:04:46.500 --> 2:04:49.240
 a very specific bloom in a small number of bacteria

2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:52.120
 that are good at using that one type of fiber,

2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:54.300
 and that's at the expense of all the other microbes

2:04:54.300 --> 2:04:55.280
 that are in the gut.

2:04:55.280 --> 2:04:59.720
 And so it's really hard to replicate with purified fiber

2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:01.720
 what you'd get, for instance, at a salad bar

2:05:01.720 --> 2:05:04.720
 in terms of the array of complex carbohydrates

2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:06.820
 that you would be exposing your microbiota to.

2:05:06.820 --> 2:05:11.820
 And I think the kind of broad view of this in the field

2:05:13.740 --> 2:05:17.640
 is that consuming a broad variety of plants

2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:21.540
 and all the diverse fiber that comes with that

2:05:21.540 --> 2:05:24.880
 is probably better in fostering diversity in your microbiota

2:05:24.880 --> 2:05:26.180
 than purified fibers.

2:05:26.180 --> 2:05:29.640
 Now, there are, again, a lot of people who benefit

2:05:29.640 --> 2:05:32.880
 from purified fibers, either for GI motility

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:36.040
 or for other aspects of GI health problems

2:05:36.040 --> 2:05:37.440
 that they've been experiencing.

2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:38.720
 Again, I think it's the type of thing

2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:40.960
 where you have to try to find the thing

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:42.480
 that that's right for you.

2:05:42.480 --> 2:05:46.360
 But there also are studies that suggest

2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:50.880
 that if you layer rapidly fermentable fibers

2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:55.440
 on top of a Western diet, you actually can result

2:05:55.440 --> 2:05:58.680
 in weird metabolism happening in your liver

2:05:58.680 --> 2:06:01.680
 because you have this incredibly rapid fermentation of fiber

2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:04.720
 along with a lot of fat coming into the system.

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:06.720
 At least that's the theory.

2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:09.800
 And in a mouse study that was published a few years ago,

2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:11.840
 they actually see that a subset of the mice

2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:14.120
 develop hepatocellular carcinoma

2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:18.240
 when they're fed a high dose prebiotic liver cancer

2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:21.200
 on top of a Western diet.

2:06:21.200 --> 2:06:23.920
 So whether that's representative of human biology,

2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:27.120
 we don't know, but purified fibers

2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:29.160
 are definitely very different,

2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:30.920
 both in terms of the diversity of structures,

2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:34.280
 but also in terms of how rapidly they're fermented

2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:38.480
 in the gut, because if you are eating plants,

2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:41.640
 the complex structures there really slow the microbes down

2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:43.280
 in terms of fermentation and you end up

2:06:43.280 --> 2:06:45.400
 with a slow rate of fermentation

2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:46.840
 over the length of your colon,

2:06:46.840 --> 2:06:49.440
 as opposed to this big burst of fermentation

2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:50.880
 that can happen if you eat something

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:55.880
 that is highly soluble and easily accessed by the microbes.

2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:57.080
 Interesting. So I guess,

2:06:57.080 --> 2:06:59.240
 is it fair to come back to this idea,

2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:01.120
 trying to avoid processed foods,

2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:03.120
 the highly palatable foods,

2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:05.280
 they're all sometimes super highly palatable foods

2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:06.920
 they're now called that are packed

2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:08.280
 with hidden sugars, emulsifiers.

2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.000
 So it sounds like some fiber is good.

2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:13.840
 And despite the outcome of the study,

2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:16.360
 you identified that if you have the appropriate microbiota,

2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:18.320
 then you will background,

2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:21.600
 then one will respond even better to the fiber,

2:07:21.600 --> 2:07:24.440
 maybe a longer ramp up phase for those folks.

2:07:24.440 --> 2:07:26.320
 And then the fermented foods,

2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:27.880
 because there's no reason why you can't do both.

2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:29.520
 And as we've talked about before,

2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.640
 a lot of fermented foods have fiber.

2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:33.560
 So you can kill two birds with one stone.

2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:36.000
 Totally. And it could be that the diversity increase

2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.560
 that we saw in the high fermented food group

2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:41.640
 could be something that would aid the high fiber group.

2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:44.120
 And so now we're planning another study coming up

2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:46.680
 where we're doing high fiber, high fermented food,

2:07:46.680 --> 2:07:48.320
 and then fiber plus fermented food,

2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:50.120
 just to see if there's a synergistic effect there.

2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:51.760
 Great. I want to enroll.

2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:54.040
 Seriously, although I guess I'm biased

2:07:54.040 --> 2:07:56.360
 because I sort of know where you're trying to,

2:07:56.360 --> 2:07:58.440
 well, is it blood draws that you use

2:07:58.440 --> 2:08:00.040
 to measure the inflammatome?

2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:02.720
 Exactly. So we do blood draws like for two weeks.

2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:03.880
 So that's good.

2:08:03.880 --> 2:08:06.720
 So you've covered a tremendous amount of information

2:08:06.720 --> 2:08:07.960
 and I'm incredibly grateful.

2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:10.120
 This was a area of biology that,

2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:12.080
 despite having learned a lot about through papers

2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:16.040
 and going to talks and reading articles in the media,

2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:18.920
 has remained somewhat mysterious to me until today.

2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:20.600
 You've given us a very vivid picture

2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:22.440
 of how this system works.

2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:23.840
 Where can people find out more

2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:25.360
 about the work that you're doing?

2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:26.520
 We can certainly provide links.

2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:30.560
 And you and your wife who co-run your lab,

2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:31.960
 you have a book on this topic.

2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:33.000
 So could you tell us about the book

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:35.240
 where we can learn more about the Sonnenberg Lab

2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:36.840
 and the work that you're doing?

2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:38.360
 Maybe people will even try and enroll

2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:39.320
 in some of these studies.

2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:40.160
 Yeah, fantastic.

2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:42.080
 Yeah, it'd be great if we could get people to enroll.

2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:46.080
 We're always looking for willing participants.

2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:48.760
 Yeah, so Erica, my wife and I wrote a book

2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:50.000
 called The Good Gut.

2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:53.600
 And that really was a response

2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:56.120
 to how we were changing our lives

2:08:56.120 --> 2:08:57.720
 in response to being in the field,

2:08:57.720 --> 2:08:59.680
 being very familiar with the research,

2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:00.800
 seeing that a lot of our friends

2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:02.400
 that weren't studying the gut microbiome,

2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:03.760
 but were very well-informed,

2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:05.080
 many of them scientists,

2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:07.680
 were not doing the same things we were doing.

2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:09.360
 And it was very clear that it was just

2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:13.880
 the lack of information funneling out of the field

2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:15.200
 to other people.

2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:18.200
 And so we wanted to make that accessible

2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:20.640
 to people who are not microbiome scientists.

2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:22.320
 There's also a really interesting story.

2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:23.880
 We were at a conference site

2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:26.600
 that just has scientific conferences all summer long,

2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:29.040
 week after week after week, different fields.

2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:30.720
 And so it's people that work there

2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:32.400
 that are just dealing with these new groups

2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:33.840
 coming in week after week.

2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:37.320
 And the week we were there for a microbiome conference,

2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.240
 people that work in the dining commons came up to us

2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:43.600
 and they said, what group is this?

2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:44.440
 This is weird.

2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:45.280
 And we're like, what's weird?

2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:47.720
 And they said, we can't keep the salad bar stocked.

2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:50.360
 And it was very clear that nobody was doing

2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.920
 what we were doing until we'd go to a microbiome conference.

2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:54.960
 And then everybody was doing the same stuff

2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:55.800
 that we were doing.

2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:58.160
 And so anyway, we wrote this book

2:09:58.160 --> 2:09:59.400
 to talk about our personal journey

2:09:59.400 --> 2:10:01.320
 and kind of the science in the field.

2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:05.000
 And yeah, just to lay a foundation for people

2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000
 if they wanna start thinking about these changes.

2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.760
 And then in terms of kind of connecting with our research,

2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:13.680
 certainly there's the Center for Human Microbiome Studies

2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:15.760
 at Stanford, which is kind of our home base

2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:17.760
 for doing a lot of these dietary interventions.

2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:19.480
 We list the studies there,

2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:21.600
 give more information on what we're doing.

2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:23.360
 And then we have a lab website too

2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:26.440
 that people can go to and read more about our research.

2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:28.680
 Yeah, and we're always looking

2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:30.240
 for participants for our studies.

2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:33.400
 Great, well, we will provide links to all of those sources.

2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:35.600
 And I just wanna say thank you so much

2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:37.680
 for sharing with us your knowledge

2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:40.360
 for the incredible work that you and Erica,

2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:44.920
 your wife and Chris do and are continuing to do.

2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.040
 I think this is an area that when I started my training,

2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:51.000
 I heard a little bit about microbiota

2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:52.000
 and I always just thought those are people

2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.560
 that work on infectious disease and like all the bad stuff.

2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:58.600
 So it's interesting and really important

2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:01.480
 that people realize that we're carrying all this vital cargo

2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:03.040
 and we need to take care of the cargo

2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:04.800
 so it can take care of us.

2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:07.840
 So thank you so much for your time and for the work you do.

2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:09.240
 And I hope we can do it again.

2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:10.080
 Thanks, Andrew.

2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:11.560
 This was a great conversation.

2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:12.400
 Terrific.

2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:13.240
 Thank you for joining me today

2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:16.180
 for my discussion with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg,

2:11:16.180 --> 2:11:17.800
 all about the gut microbiome

2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:21.120
 and how to optimize your gut microbiome for health.

2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:23.480
 Please check out the Sonnenberg Lab webpage.

2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:28.480
 That's Sonnenberg spelled S-O-N-N-E-N-B-U-R-G-L-A-B

2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:30.920
.stanford.edu.

2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:34.260
 That's sonnenberglab.stanford.edu.

2:11:34.260 --> 2:11:36.860
 They often recruit for studies exploring

2:11:36.860 --> 2:11:38.960
 how different aspects of nutrition impact

2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:39.920
 the gut microbiome,

2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:42.520
 much as we discussed during today's episode.

2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:44.960
 Please also check out the book that he and his wife,

2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:47.560
 Dr. Erica Sonnenberg wrote called The Good Gut.

2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:49.720
 It's readily available on all the usual sites,

2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:51.380
 such as Amazon and so forth.

2:11:51.380 --> 2:11:53.660

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:31.200
 We also have a Patreon.

2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:33.960
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:35.720
 and there you can support the podcast

2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:37.280
 at any level that you like.

2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:39.100
 On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:39.940
 including today,

2:12:39.940 --> 2:12:41.480
 we discuss supplements.

2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:44.160
 While supplements are certainly not necessary for everybody,

2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:46.440
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:48.280
 for things like sleep and focus,

2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:51.180
 and indeed gut microbiome support.

2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:52.800
 The one issue with supplements, however,

2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:55.240
 is that many of the supplement companies out there

2:12:55.240 --> 2:12:57.560
 do not independently test their supplements.

2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:01.440
 So there isn't tremendous confidence in all supplements

2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:03.620
 that they contain the amounts of the ingredients

2:13:03.620 --> 2:13:04.880
 that are listed on the bottle,

2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:06.440
 and that the quality of the ingredients

2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:07.600
 is where it should be.

2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:09.340
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne,

2:13:09.340 --> 2:13:11.280
 that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:13.040
 because Thorne supplements are known

2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:15.120
 to have the very highest levels of stringency

2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:18.160
 with respect to the quality of the supplements

2:13:18.160 --> 2:13:21.200
 and the amounts of the supplements listed on their bottles

2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:23.560
 lists what's actually in the containers,

2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:24.940
 which is essential.

2:13:24.940 --> 2:13:26.840
 If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,

2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:31.840
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.400
 and you can get 20% off any of the Thorne supplements

2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:35.440
 that are listed there.

2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.720
 Also, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:40.680
 through that portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:43.400
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:45.080
 that Thorne makes.

2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:46.780
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab

2:13:46.780 --> 2:13:49.180
 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

2:13:49.180 --> 2:13:52.040
 There I cover topics about science and science-based tools,

2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:54.600
 some of which overlap with the content of this podcast,

2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:56.600
 much of which is separate and unique

2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:58.400
 from the content of this podcast.

2:13:58.400 --> 2:13:59.680
 We also have a newsletter.

2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:01.560
 It is called the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:04.920
 Once a month, we put out short summaries of podcast episodes

2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:08.200
 and key takeaways, actionable takeaways in particular.

2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:10.980
 You can sign up for that by going to hubermanlab.com.

2:14:10.980 --> 2:14:12.240
 You can look in the menu,

2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:13.780
 look for Neural Network Newsletter.

2:14:13.780 --> 2:14:15.660
 You can download previous newsletters

2:14:15.660 --> 2:14:18.120
 to take a look at what those are like and about

2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:19.360
 even before signing up.

2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:21.280
 If you subscribe, we don't share your information

2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:22.420

2:14:22.420 --> 2:14:25.680
 The privacy policy is made very clear at hubermanlab.com.

2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:27.220
 So thank you once again for joining me

2:14:27.220 --> 2:14:29.480
 for today's discussion about the gut microbiome.

2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:31.840
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:33.800
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:36.140
 I'll see you in the next one.
