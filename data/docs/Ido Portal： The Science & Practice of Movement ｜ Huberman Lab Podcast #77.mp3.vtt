00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.360 --> 00:13.260
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.260 --> 00:15.240
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.600
 Today, my guest is Ido Portal.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.880
 Ido Portal is somebody who truly defies formal definition.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.800
 He is, however, credited by many

00:23.800 --> 00:27.260
 to be the world expert in all things movement.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.060
 Movement is one of the more fascinating

00:29.060 --> 00:31.460
 and important aspects of our nervous system.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.680
 In fact, it was the great Nobel Prize winner, Sherrington,

00:34.680 --> 00:37.360
 that said, movement is the final common path.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.760
 And what he was referring to is the fact

00:39.760 --> 00:43.000
 that so much of our nervous system is dedicated to movement,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.680
 and in particular, that the human nervous system

00:45.680 --> 00:49.260
 can generate the greatest variety of forms of movement.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.240
 We can run, we can jump, we can crawl,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.000
 we can move at different speeds.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.280
 Far more variation in movement and different types

00:56.280 --> 00:57.140
 and speeds of movement

00:57.140 --> 01:00.640
 than any other animal in the animal kingdom can perform.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.800
 My interest in bringing Ido Portal onto this podcast

01:03.800 --> 01:05.920
 stemmed from a discussion about just that,

01:05.920 --> 01:08.740
 about Sherrington and the enormous range of movements

01:08.740 --> 01:10.200
 that humans can engage in.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.480
 Ido is both a practitioner and an intellectual.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.920
 We all know what a practitioner is.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.280
 It's somebody who walks the walk,

01:16.280 --> 01:18.220
 who actually performs the thing

01:18.220 --> 01:20.320
 that they are knowledgeable about.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.280
 And indeed, Ido has studied capoeira,

01:23.280 --> 01:26.140
 a number of other martial arts, dance, gymnastics,

01:26.140 --> 01:27.440
 various forms of sport.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.200
 He's trained top athletes like Conor McGregor,

01:30.200 --> 01:32.720
 and he has many, many other credits to his name

01:32.720 --> 01:35.120
 as a practitioner and teacher.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.900
 However, he is also a true intellectual of movement.

01:38.900 --> 01:41.080
 I define an intellectual as somebody

01:41.080 --> 01:44.280
 who can both think about and talk about a subject

01:44.280 --> 01:46.380
 at multiple levels of granularity.

01:46.380 --> 01:50.680
 That is, with exquisite detail and with exquisite simplicity

01:50.680 --> 01:51.920
 depending on their audience

01:51.920 --> 01:53.580
 and depending on the topic at hand.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.240
 And as you'll soon hear from my discussion with Ido,

01:56.240 --> 01:58.360
 he is both a practitioner

01:58.360 --> 02:01.500
 and a true intellectual of all things movement.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.060
 Today, through our discussion,

02:03.060 --> 02:06.080
 you will learn how the nervous system generates movement

02:06.080 --> 02:07.440
 and the different forms of movement,

02:07.440 --> 02:08.960
 the different speeds of movement.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.200
 You're also going to get an incredible insight

02:11.200 --> 02:15.580
 through Ido's mind and eyes of how movement can serve us

02:15.580 --> 02:17.640
 in the various contexts of life,

02:17.640 --> 02:20.440
 not just in sport, not just in exercise,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.800
 but in every aspect of our lives

02:22.800 --> 02:24.200
 from the time we get up in the morning

02:24.200 --> 02:26.140
 until the time we go to sleep at night,

02:26.140 --> 02:28.940
 how we engage with others, how we engage with ourselves,

02:28.940 --> 02:31.840
 indeed, how movement even informs relationships

02:31.840 --> 02:33.500
 of different kinds.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.640
 I found our discussion to be one of the most enlightening

02:36.640 --> 02:38.720
 and interesting discussions that I've ever had,

02:38.720 --> 02:42.100
 not just about movement, but about the nervous system.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.460
 I can assure you that by the end of this episode,

02:44.460 --> 02:47.820
 you will not only learn a tremendous amount about movement

02:47.820 --> 02:51.360
 through the eyes and mind of the one and only Ido Portal,

02:51.360 --> 02:54.960
 but you also will learn a tremendous amount of neuroscience

02:54.960 --> 02:57.260
 about how the cells and circuits and hormones

02:57.260 --> 03:00.720
 and neurotransmitters of your body assist in creating

03:00.720 --> 03:03.000
 the various forms of movement that you can generate,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
 that you're trying to learn and generate,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.240
 and that perhaps you should think about

03:07.240 --> 03:08.880
 trying to learn and generate.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.840
 And indeed, you'll learn some protocols and tools

03:10.840 --> 03:11.960
 for how to do that.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.800
 In science, we have a phrase, actually it's a title,

03:14.800 --> 03:18.320
 that's reserved for only the rarest of individuals.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.000
 We say that somebody is an N of one,

03:21.000 --> 03:22.920
 meaning a sample size of one.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.360
 And as you'll soon learn, Ido Portal is truly an N of one.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.880
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:29.880 --> 03:32.480
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.400
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:34.400 --> 03:36.840
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:36.840 --> 03:39.400
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.440
 In keeping with that theme,

03:40.440 --> 03:43.100
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.280
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.640
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral

03:47.640 --> 03:50.000
 probiotic drink that also has adaptogens

03:50.000 --> 03:51.520
 and digestive enzymes.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.400
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.640
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.660
 In fact, when people ask me what's the one supplement

03:58.660 --> 04:01.100
 they should take, I always say Athletic Greens,

04:01.100 --> 04:04.560
 because it covers all of those essential nutritional bases,

04:04.560 --> 04:07.800
 and the probiotics, adaptogens, and digestive enzymes

04:07.800 --> 04:09.960
 are vital for things like the gut microbiome.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.400
 Your gut microbiome is trillions of little microbacteria

04:13.400 --> 04:15.600
 that live in your gut and that support your immune system,

04:15.600 --> 04:18.280
 your endocrine system, and the so-called gut-brain axis,

04:18.280 --> 04:20.920
 which is important for mood and neurotransmitter production,

04:20.920 --> 04:24.560
 a huge number of biological systems in your brain and body.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.980
 Athletic Greens also tastes great.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.300
 I mix mine with water,

04:27.300 --> 04:29.500
 and I like a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice in there.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.240
 As I mentioned, I drink it twice a day,

04:31.240 --> 04:33.600
 usually once in the morning during the phase of the day

04:33.600 --> 04:36.080
 in which typically I'm fasting or around breakfast time,

04:36.080 --> 04:38.340
 and then again in the afternoon or even in the evening.

04:38.340 --> 04:39.600
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

04:39.600 --> 04:42.300
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:42.300 --> 04:43.760
 to claim a special offer.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.420
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

04:45.420 --> 04:47.600
 which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

04:47.600 --> 04:49.180
 while you're on the road,

04:49.180 --> 04:52.640
 and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.600
 Vitamin D3 and K2 are important for endocrine health,

04:56.600 --> 04:57.840
 for cardiovascular health,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.180
 for calcium regulation, and so on.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.780
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:02.780 --> 05:04.360
 to claim this special offer.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.000
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.880
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:08.880 --> 05:12.520
 that are of the absolute highest quality and practicality.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.580
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,

05:14.580 --> 05:15.960
 and I can tell you that your visual system

05:15.960 --> 05:18.020
 has to contend with an enormous number of challenges.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.960
 For instance, when you move from a shady area

05:19.960 --> 05:22.780
 to a bright area, your eyes have to adapt to that.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.600
 Roca understands the various challenges

05:24.600 --> 05:26.000
 that the visual system has to face,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.380
 and they've developed sunglasses and eyeglasses

05:28.380 --> 05:30.780
 with all of that biology in mind.

05:30.780 --> 05:31.840
 Their glasses were developed

05:31.840 --> 05:34.080
 by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,

05:34.080 --> 05:36.520
 and initially, Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses

05:36.520 --> 05:38.200
 were for athletes.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.900
 They designed eyeglasses that then and still now

05:40.900 --> 05:42.400
 will stay on your face if you get sweaty,

05:42.400 --> 05:43.420
 you can wear them running,

05:43.420 --> 05:44.840
 you can wear them cycling, et cetera.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.720
 They're very lightweight,

05:45.720 --> 05:47.080
 so lightweight, in fact, that most of the time

05:47.080 --> 05:49.080
 you don't even remember that they're on your face,

05:49.080 --> 05:50.720
 but Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:50.720 --> 05:52.240
 also come in a terrific aesthetic,

05:52.240 --> 05:53.400
 so you can wear them anywhere.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.560
 So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses out there

05:55.560 --> 05:57.240
 that make people look like cyborgs,

05:57.240 --> 05:59.300
 you can wear Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:59.300 --> 06:01.800
 when exercising, to dinner, to work.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.600
 Again, the aesthetics are really terrific

06:03.600 --> 06:05.920
 and really adaptable to all those different environments.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.420
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

06:07.420 --> 06:10.160
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

06:10.160 --> 06:13.540
 and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off your first order.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.820
 Again, that's R-O-K-A.com, enter the code Huberman

06:16.820 --> 06:17.660
 at checkout.

06:17.660 --> 06:20.200
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.360
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

06:22.360 --> 06:25.220
 that are customized to your sleep needs.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.880
 I've talked a lot on this podcast and on other podcasts

06:27.880 --> 06:30.760
 and on social media about the essential need for sleep.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.680
 Put simply, sleep is the foundation of all mental health,

06:33.680 --> 06:35.720
 physical health, and performance.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.800
 Just a few nights or even one night's poor sleep

06:37.800 --> 06:40.120
 can really hinder your mental health, physical health,

06:40.120 --> 06:43.080
 and performance in all aspects of life.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.960
 Helix has customized sleep products,

06:45.960 --> 06:47.640
 that is mattresses and pillows

06:47.640 --> 06:49.360
 that are designed to your sleep needs.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.800
 And you can figure out what those sleep needs are

06:50.800 --> 06:53.040
 very easily by going to the Helix website.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.060
 They have a quiz that takes just about two minutes

06:55.060 --> 06:57.200
 and asks you questions like, do you sleep on your back,

06:57.200 --> 06:58.080
 your side, or your stomach?

06:58.080 --> 07:00.560
 Do you tend to run hot or cold during sleep, et cetera?

07:00.560 --> 07:02.280
 Or maybe you don't even know the answers to those questions.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.100
 That's fine too.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.980
 That's an option that you can answer as well.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.480
 You take the brief two minute quiz

07:07.480 --> 07:09.120
 and then Helix will match you

07:09.120 --> 07:11.480
 to the ideal mattress and pillow for you.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.180
 I matched to the so-called dusk mattress.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.380
 I started sleeping on that well over a year ago now,

07:16.380 --> 07:17.880
 and it's the best sleep I've ever had.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.480
 I'm sleeping much longer and much better

07:21.480 --> 07:22.560
 through the entire night.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.280
 And as a consequence, I'm feeling much better,

07:24.280 --> 07:26.640
 more clear, more physically alert, et cetera,

07:26.640 --> 07:27.760
 throughout the day.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.360
 If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

07:29.360 --> 07:31.860
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman.

07:31.860 --> 07:32.960
 You can take that two minute quiz

07:32.960 --> 07:34.880
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.880
 And you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders

07:37.880 --> 07:39.340
 and two free pillows.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.480
 Again, if you're interested, you go to helixsleep.com,

07:41.480 --> 07:45.260
 slash Huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.560
 And now for my discussion with Ido Portal.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.720
 Ido, thank you for coming here today.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.460
 I've been looking forward to sitting down with you

07:53.460 --> 07:55.760
 to talk for a very long time.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.680
 I was first exposed to your work,

07:58.680 --> 08:02.160
 my post or a podcast, I believe,

08:02.160 --> 08:06.240
 of you had a group of people walking down handrails,

08:06.240 --> 08:08.200
 literally the handrails along stairwells.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.860
 And as a, I don't want to say former skateboarder,

08:10.860 --> 08:13.000
 once a skateboarder, always a skateboarder.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.580
 As a skateboarder, handrails have a particular meaning,

08:16.580 --> 08:19.960
 but I was really struck by, first of all,

08:21.160 --> 08:24.220
 the incredible range of skill that people had,

08:24.220 --> 08:27.680
 and yet their willingness to do this, right?

08:27.680 --> 08:29.760
 I think of handrails and walking on handrails

08:29.760 --> 08:32.200
 or skateboarding on handrails as a potential hazard.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.400
 And yet some of the incredible proficiency

08:35.400 --> 08:37.500
 that some of the people there, including yourself, had.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.340
 So like many people,

08:38.340 --> 08:41.080
 I was drawn to your practice and your work initially

08:41.080 --> 08:43.500
 through a wide-eyed, wow,

08:43.500 --> 08:46.280
 they're doing some incredible stuff on natural objects,

08:46.280 --> 08:49.100
 much as skateboarders or parkour folks do.

08:49.100 --> 08:52.160
 But over the years, we've been in communication

08:52.160 --> 08:55.600
 and I've come to realize that you're a true intellectual

08:55.600 --> 08:57.320
 of the topic of movement.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.080
 And I define an intellectual as somebody

08:59.080 --> 09:02.940
 who can understand a topic at multiple levels of granularity,

09:02.940 --> 09:06.540
 detailed, general, specific, connections, et cetera.

09:06.540 --> 09:11.200
 So to start off, could you share with us

09:11.200 --> 09:15.320
 your conception of this idea of movement?

09:16.800 --> 09:20.840
 Obviously, movement involves translation through space,

09:20.840 --> 09:23.880
 but when you talk about a movement practice,

09:23.880 --> 09:25.680
 what are you really thinking about?

09:25.680 --> 09:26.800
 What are we talking about

09:26.800 --> 09:29.080
 when we talk about a movement practice?

09:30.600 --> 09:33.180
 It's a big question.

09:33.180 --> 09:38.180
 I somehow left the definition,

09:38.860 --> 09:43.860
 the very tight definition of it out for myself

09:43.860 --> 09:46.380
 because I felt it was starting to constrict me

09:46.380 --> 09:47.220
 and be around me

09:47.220 --> 09:49.920
 and I let the practice itself really define it.

09:51.440 --> 09:55.940
 But I think part of our sense of everything

09:55.940 --> 09:58.300
 is actually a sense of movement

09:58.300 --> 10:02.340
 and then the stillness in the background of that.

10:02.340 --> 10:06.520
 So for me, this is the entity that I refer to as movement

10:06.520 --> 10:11.020
 and using that perspective for self-evolution,

10:11.020 --> 10:14.560
 development, of course, the physical side,

10:14.560 --> 10:16.300
 but also movement of emotions,

10:16.300 --> 10:21.300
 movement of thoughts and any other movement streams.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.180
 And by switching these layers

10:24.180 --> 10:26.180
 and examining it from different places,

10:26.180 --> 10:28.340
 you get a better and better sense of it.

10:28.340 --> 10:32.540
 I think the visuals nowadays and media

10:32.540 --> 10:36.200
 are what defines for people in the beginning things

10:36.200 --> 10:38.080
 and then little by little with experience,

10:38.080 --> 10:40.220
 they can dive deeper, which is good.

10:40.220 --> 10:45.040
 There is some aspects, sexy aspects or not so sexy aspects,

10:45.040 --> 10:48.200
 and then you pull on it and you start to examine

10:48.200 --> 10:51.880
 and dive deeper and then you receive

10:51.880 --> 10:54.960
 the gift of finding out more.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.540
 I heard you say once that we are not just a brain

10:58.540 --> 11:02.020
 with a body, but we are a body with a brain,

11:02.020 --> 11:05.220
 which I absolutely love because as a student

11:05.220 --> 11:07.380
 and a researcher of the nervous system,

11:07.380 --> 11:10.700
 I never think about the brain as its own isolated thing.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.820
 I think about the nervous system

11:11.820 --> 11:13.780
 and the fact that the brain and the spinal cord

11:13.780 --> 11:14.780
 are connected to the body

11:14.780 --> 11:19.260
 and the body is connected to the brain in every direction.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.960
 It's everything truly is connected

11:21.960 --> 11:24.980
 at the physical level, physiological level.

11:24.980 --> 11:26.780
 Could you just share for a moment

11:26.780 --> 11:29.400
 how you think about this body-brain relationship

11:29.400 --> 11:34.300
 in terms of, you mentioned movement of emotions,

11:34.300 --> 11:35.560
 movement of the body,

11:35.560 --> 11:37.900
 that you can't really separate the two.

11:37.900 --> 11:40.940
 And for the typical person who's listening to this,

11:40.940 --> 11:44.040
 they might not immediately understand what that means.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.980
 Maybe it's something that has to be experienced,

11:45.980 --> 11:49.580
 but when we think about the body and the brain

11:49.580 --> 11:52.420
 and the whole thing working as one cohesive whole,

11:52.420 --> 11:54.460
 what does that mean to you?

11:54.460 --> 11:58.520
 Or put simply, when you do a movement practice,

11:58.520 --> 11:59.780
 what are you focusing on?

11:59.780 --> 12:01.980
 Are you focusing on the movement of your limbs?

12:01.980 --> 12:03.140
 I have to imagine that's true,

12:03.140 --> 12:05.540
 but are you also focusing on how that makes you feel

12:05.540 --> 12:07.940
 or how your feelings make you move?

12:08.940 --> 12:09.780
 Okay.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.100
 Okay, so some thoughts.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.900
 I will try not to answer any of your questions

12:16.900 --> 12:17.960
 during this interview,

12:17.960 --> 12:20.380
 but I will definitely give some thoughts

12:20.380 --> 12:21.920
 and then we can play with it.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.820
 I think these definitions,

12:27.820 --> 12:30.820
 and in general the limitation of words,

12:30.820 --> 12:35.820
 ends up creating some kind of a corruptive process.

12:37.220 --> 12:41.900
 The words corrupt us and corrupt our understanding.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.420
 So I think the brain, body,

12:43.420 --> 12:46.680
 this Cartesian state of mind and thinking,

12:46.680 --> 12:49.680
 brought a lot of good,

12:49.680 --> 12:52.080
 but also brought a lot of problems.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.360
 And movement for me is the entity

12:54.360 --> 12:56.520
 that ties everything together.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.720
 It's the magic.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.080
 It's the forza anima.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.960
 It's when the coin spins

13:02.960 --> 13:06.240
 and you see both sides appear at the same time.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.240
 It's a beautiful analogy from a friend of mine,

13:09.240 --> 13:10.540
 Dr. Rasmus Olme.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.480
 So the mind and body are one of those pairs,

13:16.480 --> 13:19.640
 and I call it the movement, body, mind system.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.640
 When it's integrated, it's in motion.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.980
 There is also a stillness that appears there, of course.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.820
 Without it, there can be no motion,

13:28.820 --> 13:33.820
 but maybe that is a very good way

13:33.820 --> 13:35.280
 to start to think of things.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.200
 There is no really pure mental processes,

13:38.200 --> 13:39.320
 cognitive processes.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.420
 There is no pure physical processes.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.280
 Everything touches everything.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.360
 There is a wholeness, and that wholeness is in motion.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.860
 Yeah, the movement practice takes these bits

13:53.860 --> 13:58.200
 and examines them, and here is a pragmatic thing.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.660
 The scientist, the cerebral thinking about movement.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.720
 This is important.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.540
 The emotional side.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.480
 Coloring, feeling the colors and the textures of motion.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.000
 A lot of people who are involved with a movement practice

14:15.000 --> 14:17.400
 never end up feeling motions,

14:17.400 --> 14:19.840
 really focusing on how it makes you feel

14:19.840 --> 14:22.040
 or how it feels itself.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.500
 And then the actual movement, the action.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.480
 So it's action, emotion, and thought.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.680
 And those are three streams of movement,

14:29.680 --> 14:31.040
 and they interlace together

14:31.040 --> 14:36.040
 into this kind of braided experience and whole experience,

14:37.180 --> 14:40.340
 and I try to bring all these aspects into my practice

14:40.340 --> 14:43.200
 and the way that I live my life.

14:43.200 --> 14:48.200
 I think most people who embark on a movement practice

14:48.400 --> 14:52.520
 will first want to know which movements to do, right?

14:52.520 --> 14:57.520
 Squats, planks, push-ups, pirouettes, right?

14:58.520 --> 15:01.280
 Pick your movement, it could be any movement.

15:01.280 --> 15:05.860
 Are there any sort of just basic entry points

15:05.860 --> 15:09.180
 that you believe everybody should walk through

15:09.180 --> 15:10.760
 as they embrace a movement practice?

15:10.760 --> 15:12.860
 The first time and maybe even every time

15:12.860 --> 15:14.360
 they do a movement practice.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.600
 I mean, earlier today I had the great privilege

15:17.600 --> 15:21.520
 of being guided through a long series of movement practices,

15:21.520 --> 15:23.840
 and yet the first practice we did involved,

15:23.840 --> 15:27.320
 at first anyway, stillness, not movement.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.880
 So if you would, could you inform us

15:30.880 --> 15:32.360
 how people should think about

15:32.360 --> 15:34.960
 approaching a movement practice?

15:34.960 --> 15:39.960
 What is the first layer of any good movement practice?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.000
 So you touch the word movements,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.420
 and it's important for me to separate it

15:44.420 --> 15:47.500
 from the word movement, with a capital M.

15:48.680 --> 15:53.440
 Movements are the containers, and movement is the content,

15:53.440 --> 15:56.000
 and the content cannot be carried

15:56.000 --> 15:58.520
 in any way without containers.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.760
 So the first entry point is to choose containers,

16:01.760 --> 16:03.840
 and then the second thing to make sure

16:03.840 --> 16:08.440
 is to put specific content into those containers

16:08.440 --> 16:10.480
 and then enjoy them.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.960
 I tell people that it's like a cup of water,

16:12.960 --> 16:14.640
 and you're being handed that cup of water,

16:14.640 --> 16:17.040
 and nowadays, very often,

16:17.040 --> 16:19.460
 people will start to chew on the cup.

16:19.460 --> 16:20.920
 Instead of drinking the water,

16:20.920 --> 16:23.400
 making it yours, discard the cup.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.540
 And then maybe later, you want to have bone broth or soup,

16:26.540 --> 16:29.400
 so you use a different container, a bowl.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.500
 So a movement practice can start from anywhere.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.280
 It's a rhizome, it's an open system.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.680
 It has no center, it's decentralized,

16:38.680 --> 16:40.760
 and it can be approached from anywhere,

16:40.760 --> 16:45.360
 and that's its magic, and that's the benefit of it.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.480
 Some people find the body a good entry point.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.820
 Some people don't even enter from the body.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.760
 Sometimes you can enter from other perspectives,

16:55.760 --> 16:57.800
 and then inside the body, for example,

16:57.800 --> 17:00.040
 where should we enter if we decided

17:00.040 --> 17:01.760
 to take the body approach?

17:01.760 --> 17:03.560
 The spine can be a nice decision,

17:03.560 --> 17:05.700
 but some will choose just the pelvis.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.480
 Any one of those points are valid,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.920
 and then playfulness can be an entry point,

17:11.920 --> 17:15.120
 an attribute, or, and this is so open,

17:15.120 --> 17:19.600
 so I don't want to limit people and limit their minds

17:19.600 --> 17:21.520
 in the way that they engage with a practice,

17:21.520 --> 17:26.520
 but I also want to encourage the self-inquiry,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.360
 am I doing movements practice,

17:29.360 --> 17:32.200
 or am I doing a movement practice?

17:32.200 --> 17:34.040
 So could you help me distinguish the two

17:34.040 --> 17:34.880
 a little bit further?

17:34.880 --> 17:36.080
 I think I understand the difference

17:36.080 --> 17:39.280
 between sort of the noun versus the verbs,

17:39.280 --> 17:42.680
 and in some ways, here we are dealing with the challenge

17:42.680 --> 17:45.740
 of the barriers that language present

17:45.740 --> 17:47.000
 to something that's physical, right?

17:47.000 --> 17:51.480
 I mean, indeed, there may not be a,

17:51.480 --> 17:54.840
 I have to assume there is no perfect verbal language

17:54.840 --> 17:55.680
 for movement.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.600
 There are certain movements that defy language.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.080
 I could say somebody jumped at a particular trajectory,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.440
 at a particular speed, and moved this limb and that limb,

18:03.440 --> 18:07.680
 but by fractionating it, something is most definitely lost.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.040
 So if someone wanted to, let's say,

18:11.040 --> 18:14.060
 get in better touch with their body, in quotes,

18:14.060 --> 18:19.060
 in order to explore the infinite space that is movement,

18:19.560 --> 18:21.940
 how might they begin to approach that?

18:21.940 --> 18:25.880
 Does it begin with an awareness, with practice, or both?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.920
 It begins with education, and that's probably

18:28.920 --> 18:33.640
 the most stable point of entry, awareness to something

18:33.640 --> 18:36.320
 as a concept, that it is a concept,

18:36.320 --> 18:38.920
 that there is a validity or,

18:38.920 --> 18:41.420
 because sometimes people look for that,

18:41.420 --> 18:45.620
 to looking at this entity, this open entity,

18:45.620 --> 18:49.360
 and that's part of the reason why answering questions

18:49.360 --> 18:54.360
 is not something I can do or even attempt to do.

18:54.360 --> 18:59.360
 I believe in the power of the non-complete process,

18:59.920 --> 19:04.920
 like making this table, but leaving something undone,

19:05.840 --> 19:07.600
 not perfecting the product.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.440
 Why?

19:08.440 --> 19:11.720
 Because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution

19:11.720 --> 19:14.020
 that naturally unravels from it.

19:16.680 --> 19:21.040
 Almost like sometimes I do it, I count reps,

19:21.040 --> 19:22.760
 and I'll only count to nine,

19:22.760 --> 19:26.880
 because it tends to leave people in the count,

19:26.880 --> 19:29.760
 and it keeps going instead of giving them the 10.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.440
 Everyone wants to end on 10.

19:31.440 --> 19:36.000
 Yeah, which is because of the decimal system, et cetera.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.120
 So, all kinds of things like that is also important

19:40.120 --> 19:43.480
 with the movement idea is to discuss, to examine,

19:43.480 --> 19:46.040
 to look, to taste, to try,

19:46.040 --> 19:47.860
 but then also not to try to capture,

19:47.860 --> 19:51.360
 because if you like the invisible loop of Hofstätte,

19:51.360 --> 19:54.480
 if you look at it too closely, it's gone.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.240
 But if you look away, it functions

19:57.240 --> 19:59.680
 and exists just like us very powerfully

19:59.680 --> 20:04.680
 and obviously gives us the experiences that we have.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.840
 So, when people enter movement practice,

20:07.840 --> 20:09.760
 it is about education,

20:09.760 --> 20:11.480
 bringing some awareness to the fact

20:11.480 --> 20:14.560
 that they are living in a body,

20:14.560 --> 20:16.580
 that they are living in motion,

20:16.580 --> 20:19.460
 that their mind is a type of movement,

20:19.460 --> 20:22.280
 that their life is a type of movement,

20:22.280 --> 20:26.360
 bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well,

20:26.360 --> 20:28.320
 bringing just attention to the fact

20:28.320 --> 20:30.800
 that things are in motion,

20:30.800 --> 20:35.800
 the euracletus pantare, all in flux.

20:37.360 --> 20:42.360
 Nothing stops besides something that is the background of it

20:42.680 --> 20:46.200
 and allows it to express, and this is the beauty of things.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.960
 And this, for me, is the movement practice,

20:48.960 --> 20:52.680
 is this examination and bringing this awareness into things.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.320
 As we see it now here, I'm also aware of my body.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.160
 I'm also aware of the way that things make me feel,

21:01.160 --> 21:04.040
 the way that your face is communicating to me.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.560
 And I'm not just in some limited

21:08.680 --> 21:11.360
 and very verbal, overly verbal state,

21:11.360 --> 21:14.100
 because it misses a lot of the beautiful flux.

21:14.100 --> 21:18.920
 I'm going to inject some, or project some ideas,

21:18.920 --> 21:23.620
 and perhaps you would tell me if they're ridiculous,

21:23.620 --> 21:25.460
 potentially useful, or useful.

21:26.340 --> 21:29.100
 As I understand what we're talking about now

21:29.100 --> 21:32.060
 and what we've discussed earlier is that movement

21:32.060 --> 21:36.020
 can and should be incorporated into one's entire life.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.540
 I've even heard you say that even before

21:37.540 --> 21:38.680
 getting out of bed in the morning,

21:38.680 --> 21:41.740
 one can experience movement and it doesn't necessarily

21:41.740 --> 21:43.820
 have to be of the intimate kind with somebody else.

21:43.820 --> 21:47.880
 It can be paying attention to the rhythm of one's breath

21:47.880 --> 21:49.260
 or how you get out of the bed,

21:49.260 --> 21:52.380
 or actually in anticipation of you arriving here today,

21:52.380 --> 21:54.460
 I noticed that as I was going up and down the stairs

21:54.460 --> 21:59.220
 in this house, that I was injecting a little bit

21:59.220 --> 22:01.580
 of playfulness in the way that I might have many,

22:01.580 --> 22:04.820
 many decades ago, but haven't for a very long time.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.460
 And I asked myself whether or not

22:07.460 --> 22:10.700
 that's what Ido is referring to when he talks about

22:10.700 --> 22:13.940
 threading this body awareness throughout the day,

22:13.940 --> 22:17.580
 as opposed to, but of course not exclusive from just saying,

22:17.580 --> 22:21.040
 I have 45 minutes, I'm going to do movement practice

22:21.040 --> 22:23.100
 before I shower and have some dinner, right?

22:23.100 --> 22:24.380
 I have to imagine both are helpful,

22:24.380 --> 22:25.860
 but in terms of moving through the day

22:25.860 --> 22:27.520
 and having bodily awareness,

22:28.820 --> 22:30.380
 clearly there are an infinite number of ways

22:30.380 --> 22:31.540
 one could do that.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.540
 Maybe you could just share a few.

22:32.540 --> 22:35.040
 You mentioned, I mean, one could pay attention

22:35.040 --> 22:37.860
 to their breath, could pay attention to posture,

22:37.860 --> 22:40.580
 and this notion of play is a very attractive

22:40.580 --> 22:43.100
 or as we say in science, it's a sticky concept,

22:43.100 --> 22:45.540
 a concept that kind of draws one in.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.500
 Maybe if you would, could you share with us

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
 just some ideas to get people thinking about

22:49.500 --> 22:51.900
 or maybe even incorporating movement practice

22:51.900 --> 22:55.620
 into their day and maybe even touch on

22:55.620 --> 22:58.300
 the potential role of play or playfulness?

22:58.300 --> 22:59.140
 Okay.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.980
 Yeah, those are some good directions.

23:04.980 --> 23:09.420
 I think one thing is this, what you call wordlessness.

23:09.420 --> 23:14.220
 I have been recommending to people nonverbal experiences

23:14.220 --> 23:16.880
 and the awareness of the body,

23:16.880 --> 23:19.460
 which is not really the awareness of the body,

23:19.460 --> 23:23.340
 as you know, not purely or not fully,

23:23.340 --> 23:28.340
 the awareness of motion is a very good way to start,

23:28.820 --> 23:31.220
 to bring awareness to that layer

23:31.220 --> 23:33.340
 and that layer will start to get clarified

23:33.340 --> 23:35.660
 more and more and more the more you practice

23:35.660 --> 23:37.820
 and then it will enable for most people

23:37.820 --> 23:42.020
 a safe haven away from many states and difficulties

23:42.020 --> 23:47.020
 and will unlock a lot of potential attributes

23:47.340 --> 23:51.360
 and strengths and freshness and a lot of beautiful things.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.780
 Really, one of the really perspectives about who we are

23:56.780 --> 24:00.120
 comes from a person who influenced my thinking,

24:00.120 --> 24:03.020
 a lot Moshe Feldenkrais, the late Moshe Feldenkrais,

24:03.020 --> 24:07.080
 and he talks about the body as the core three elements,

24:07.080 --> 24:08.480
 the core nervous system.

24:09.820 --> 24:14.820
 Two is the mechanical system of muscle, skeleton, et cetera,

24:15.100 --> 24:17.280
 and the third is the environment,

24:17.280 --> 24:20.220
 which is a unique way to look at it.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.100
 And he talks about how the nervous system

24:22.100 --> 24:26.340
 is both receiving information from the outside

24:26.340 --> 24:29.140
 and from the inside and in the first years of life,

24:29.140 --> 24:34.140
 you work a lot on differentiating what is me

24:34.660 --> 24:36.380
 and what is not me.

24:36.380 --> 24:39.460
 And I think movement, when you feel movement,

24:39.460 --> 24:42.220
 you feel the movement of the outside

24:42.220 --> 24:45.420
 that is, of course, arriving to you and receiving this

24:45.420 --> 24:47.400
 and also your own internal movement

24:47.400 --> 24:49.740
 and the same can be said for stillness.

24:50.940 --> 24:54.380
 So, bringing the attention into those layers,

24:54.380 --> 24:55.540
 it's a tricky thing.

24:55.540 --> 24:58.840
 It's one of those elusive things to look at,

24:58.840 --> 25:02.760
 but it's definitely of huge benefit to start to train it,

25:02.760 --> 25:07.620
 start to practice it, to feel not our thoughts,

25:07.620 --> 25:10.460
 not necessarily our body,

25:10.460 --> 25:14.020
 but to start to recognize the dynamic nature,

25:14.020 --> 25:18.580
 the flux, the motion, and it occurs in all these layers.

25:18.580 --> 25:22.860
 So, you will need to find it in multiple locations

25:22.860 --> 25:27.260
 before you start to more and more make it your own,

25:27.260 --> 25:28.560
 make it really yours.

25:28.560 --> 25:33.440
 How, for example, simple pragmatic things.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.720
 I used to do this, I spent some time in Hong Kong.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.480
 I would need to get my practice in,

25:39.480 --> 25:43.680
 but I'm really turned off from commercial gyms

25:43.680 --> 25:46.740
 and there is not a lot of nature accessible there,

25:46.740 --> 25:48.900
 so I would just strap on my bag

25:48.900 --> 25:50.920
 and I would walk the streets of Hong Kong,

25:50.920 --> 25:52.320
 which are very crowded,

25:52.320 --> 25:55.720
 and then I would try to avoid touching anyone.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.100
 And it would be like two hours of just like moving,

25:59.100 --> 26:01.480
 involved, fully involved, fully in my body

26:01.480 --> 26:04.400
 and experiencing beautiful things

26:04.400 --> 26:07.000
 and enjoying and developing myself as well

26:07.000 --> 26:08.980
 in all kinds of scenarios, up and down,

26:08.980 --> 26:11.560
 and in the escalators and off.

26:11.560 --> 26:16.560
 So, this is an example of a way to practice.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.400
 And then the way that we're sitting, like these chairs,

26:20.400 --> 26:22.960
 for example, our chairs are not very dynamic,

26:22.960 --> 26:24.440
 but there is rocking chairs, right?

26:24.440 --> 26:27.760
 And this is something I recommend for a lot of kids.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.880
 Like in schools, I used to rock on the chair,

26:30.880 --> 26:32.280
 which is very common.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.120
 Yeah, I used to have my skateboard underneath my chair

26:34.120 --> 26:35.160
 and roll it back and forth

26:35.160 --> 26:37.560
 and the teacher would tell me to stop.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.040
 And I'm just slowly, little by little,

26:39.040 --> 26:40.680
 trying to get the most subtle movement I could

26:40.680 --> 26:43.660
 without them telling me they were going to take it away.

26:43.660 --> 26:44.500
 Or try.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.880
 Which is probably horrible,

26:45.880 --> 26:48.580
 horrible advice and instruction.

26:48.580 --> 26:51.760
 Just like sit up straight and chew with your mouth closed

26:51.760 --> 26:56.160
 because they remove a lot of the self-education

26:56.160 --> 26:57.720
 and a lot of the self-development

26:57.720 --> 27:00.400
 and the practicum and discoveries that are necessary

27:00.400 --> 27:03.360
 and even will damage focus

27:03.360 --> 27:07.320
 and thinking processes in some ways.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.840
 So, for example, I would make the chairs even more mobile

27:13.920 --> 27:16.960
 and I would support more motion

27:16.960 --> 27:19.160
 and then I would be able to bring attention there,

27:19.160 --> 27:22.240
 but I would also be able to bring attention away from it

27:22.240 --> 27:23.660
 into other things.

27:23.660 --> 27:26.240
 And it keeps refreshing me.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.200
 So I don't become stale, the water doesn't stand.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.840
 This is the beauty of movement.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.300
 So you can focus for long periods of time

27:33.300 --> 27:35.080
 and do incredible things with the mind,

27:35.080 --> 27:37.120
 with focus, with awareness, attention.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.240
 And it's with skin in the game.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.960
 So I'm not talking as some meditator

27:42.960 --> 27:46.600
 and he's describing the act of being very focused,

27:46.600 --> 27:49.280
 but then I put a stick on the edge of his fingers

27:49.280 --> 27:51.040
 and I tell him, balance it.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.800
 Everyone can do it for 10 seconds.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.520
 And I tell him, okay, now hold it 10 minutes.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.800
 And you see that the skill has, he has no skin in the game.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.040
 It wasn't developed in various scenarios,

28:03.040 --> 28:05.520
 so there is a delusion that start to develop.

28:07.280 --> 28:11.160
 And that's how movement keeps me very honest

28:11.160 --> 28:14.640
 and humble in the way that I view humility

28:14.640 --> 28:19.640
 and in a way that protects me and keeps me fresh.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.800
 I love the example of moving through the crowded street

28:27.800 --> 28:29.120
 with a backpack because of the way

28:29.120 --> 28:30.760
 in which it's completely adaptive

28:30.760 --> 28:32.840
 to the situation you happen to be in

28:32.840 --> 28:36.440
 and highlights the fact that one doesn't need a gym

28:36.440 --> 28:39.680
 or any specific scenario.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.240
 Although we will certainly touch

28:41.240 --> 28:43.800
 on ideal learning circumstances for movement

28:43.800 --> 28:47.600
 and some of the work that you're doing, of course.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.480
 The less of your own personal practice

28:50.480 --> 28:53.560
 and understanding and knowledge you've done,

28:53.560 --> 28:55.000
 the more toys you need.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.160
 The more you've really worked on yourself,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.760
 the more high-tech you are.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.760
 The more low-tech are your tools,

29:03.760 --> 29:05.240
 the more high-tech you are.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.680
 And this is the most advanced technology

29:08.680 --> 29:11.960
 by far on this planet with all the advancement.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.960
 It doesn't even start to scratch,

29:13.960 --> 29:17.560
 and you know it from the way that we understand the eyes

29:17.560 --> 29:21.640
 all the way to, with all due respect to the Boston Robotics,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.920
 a five-year-old motion movements

29:26.920 --> 29:30.200
 or animal motion was very underdeveloped

29:30.200 --> 29:33.040
 still relatively to us systems.

29:33.040 --> 29:37.040
 So important to remind ourselves.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.080
 A lot can be done with the body and gravity.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.320
 Floor, a piece of floor, a piece of wall.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.600
 A corner of a room is a beautiful scenario

29:45.600 --> 29:50.120
 which you can become, discover in and play in.

29:51.200 --> 29:55.000
 But we are not so developed, so we don't see those options.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.920
 And this is something that I try to stimulate,

29:56.920 --> 29:58.640
 and that's why I made it a point

29:58.640 --> 30:03.640
 to avoid any of the big sponsorship and high-tech tools.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.760
 At one point I brought a stick into big conventions,

30:07.760 --> 30:12.760
 or sometimes I use a shirt with holes in it,

30:12.760 --> 30:15.360
 just like I use shirt as a point to make

30:15.360 --> 30:19.560
 when I'm addressing a crowd to keep things

30:19.560 --> 30:21.480
 where it's important.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.520
 And it's important, we are important,

30:24.520 --> 30:27.080
 and our experience is important.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.600
 And we have to be very careful.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.720
 These habits and these directions,

30:33.720 --> 30:36.080
 they come from many times good intention,

30:36.080 --> 30:39.520
 but they are the devil many times.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.560
 They turn into the devil, just like our technology nowadays

30:43.560 --> 30:45.480
 and what is happening with people,

30:45.480 --> 30:48.920
 with depression, with meaninglessness,

30:50.600 --> 30:52.840
 also with the body in various perspectives,

30:52.840 --> 30:57.360
 or even I will also flip it into high-performance sports.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.520
 And their price, because for me

31:00.520 --> 31:01.760
 this is not a movement practice.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.880
 It erases the person in the center of it.

31:04.880 --> 31:09.920
 And then came places like skateboarding or breakdancing,

31:09.920 --> 31:12.240
 where somebody with a disability

31:12.240 --> 31:14.040
 becomes the best in the world,

31:14.040 --> 31:16.200
 turns it into the biggest advantage,

31:16.200 --> 31:19.400
 but you would never be accepted into gymnastics class.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.880
 And I love that.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.800
 And that change, to place change in the center,

31:24.800 --> 31:27.960
 it's important.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.520
 You touched on mention of a few sports.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.920
 Maybe it was Charles Polquin,

31:32.920 --> 31:36.920
 or maybe it was another trainer that I heard once say

31:36.920 --> 31:41.200
 that for kids, one of the worst things they can do

31:41.200 --> 31:44.120
 is over-specialize in a particular sport.

31:44.120 --> 31:48.520
 The idea being that it leads to improvements in performance

31:48.520 --> 31:49.840
 in a very narrow domain,

31:49.840 --> 31:52.680
 but they raise the idea of a sport that is

31:52.680 --> 31:55.960
 that it perhaps also constrains the development

31:55.960 --> 31:59.200
 of the nervous system such that certain emotional states,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.720
 certain intellectual abilities will forever be shut off

32:02.720 --> 32:06.000
 because of the intense plasticity that occurs early in life.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.920
 The more I learn from you,

32:07.920 --> 32:09.800
 the more I'm thinking that that statement

32:09.800 --> 32:11.840
 really should be extended to all of life.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.080
 And I loved to remind people,

32:14.080 --> 32:16.840
 because I started off as a developmental neurobiologist,

32:16.840 --> 32:18.880
 that development doesn't start and end.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.200
 You don't have to do that.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.760
 Just that development doesn't start and end.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.160
 You don't have childhood and adulthood.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.920
 Our life is one long developmental arc

32:25.920 --> 32:28.680
 from birth until death, however long that might be.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.800
 So if one is going to be anti-specialist,

32:32.800 --> 32:35.680
 maybe even we call that a generalist,

32:35.680 --> 32:36.680
 what does that look like?

32:36.680 --> 32:39.600
 What are the different domains of movement practice?

32:39.600 --> 32:44.600
 And as I asked this, I realized I am in serious danger

32:44.760 --> 32:48.280
 of fractionating movement into a list of words

32:48.280 --> 32:52.560
 like strength and speed and explosiveness and suppleness,

32:52.560 --> 32:54.440
 a word that I've heard you use before.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.520
 And yet I think for most people,

32:55.520 --> 32:58.440
 because we think in words often,

32:59.840 --> 33:01.520
 some of those categories can be useful.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.600
 So let's say I was going to embark on a movement practice

33:03.600 --> 33:06.920
 or a child was going to embark on a movement practice

33:06.920 --> 33:08.360
 either throughout the day

33:08.360 --> 33:10.880
 or for a dedicated period of time.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.760
 What are the sorts of categories of movement

33:12.760 --> 33:14.760
 that I might want to think about?

33:14.760 --> 33:17.040
 Ballistic movement, smooth movement.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.040
 Maybe you could just enrich us

33:19.040 --> 33:21.920
 with some of the landscape around that.

33:21.920 --> 33:26.640
 Okay, first I'll address the first part that you mentioned.

33:26.640 --> 33:31.320
 And I've learned from you about certain changes

33:31.320 --> 33:35.280
 in the way that things develop later in life

33:35.280 --> 33:36.960
 versus earlier in life.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.520
 And you're right, this was something

33:38.520 --> 33:40.320
 that Charles Poliquin also mentioned

33:40.320 --> 33:42.920
 and I learned from back in the day as well from him,

33:42.920 --> 33:47.800
 which can seem dark a bit and kind of hopeless,

33:47.800 --> 33:52.240
 but then you should go beyond that.

33:53.760 --> 33:58.760
 One thing that does seem to appear for me

33:59.880 --> 34:04.880
 when I look around is these concepts of unique postures.

34:08.120 --> 34:12.120
 And I think this is true for postures of thought,

34:12.120 --> 34:16.080
 emotional postures and movement postures.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.720
 Truly, earlier in life,

34:18.720 --> 34:21.800
 we are creating these unique postures

34:22.680 --> 34:27.680
 and they get into these drawers or like a language, letters.

34:29.880 --> 34:34.880
 Later in life, the process moves more towards integration

34:34.960 --> 34:39.120
 of these unique postures into all different organizations.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.800
 The beauty of it is that you can use very few postures

34:41.800 --> 34:44.240
 to create many possibilities,

34:44.240 --> 34:47.560
 just like Leibniz search for a language

34:47.560 --> 34:52.040
 that contain one symbol only versus two,

34:52.040 --> 34:53.200
 which he discovered.

34:56.200 --> 35:01.200
 And this is something that is often seen,

35:01.200 --> 35:04.920
 like you take someone who moves in a certain way

35:04.920 --> 35:08.200
 and you teach him all these new sports or techniques,

35:08.200 --> 35:11.480
 but essentially, if you look deeply and you're sensitive,

35:11.480 --> 35:14.080
 you see it's the same postures

35:14.080 --> 35:17.080
 that he will have to work with till the end of his life.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.600
 The same thinking postures.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.280
 And this is really problematic,

35:24.280 --> 35:29.280
 where we are not freeing the mind beyond

35:31.400 --> 35:36.400
 this, how would I say, a scaffolding of thinking

35:37.880 --> 35:40.360
 and we are actually letting go of the content.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.240
 We get more and more focused

35:43.240 --> 35:48.240
 on the way of thinking versus the thinking itself

35:50.360 --> 35:54.640
 or habitual ways and forms of thinking,

35:54.640 --> 35:58.640
 associative thinking, et cetera, and emotionally the same.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.080
 We are constructing these emotional postures

36:01.080 --> 36:03.360
 and then we have to go through the rest of our lives

36:03.360 --> 36:05.040
 working with that.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.600
 So, this is the dark side, right?

36:07.600 --> 36:11.880
 But of course, there are always possibilities,

36:11.880 --> 36:16.880
 both, I think, invading this early system to some extent,

36:17.960 --> 36:21.960
 even if it's 5% or 7% or whatever percent.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.920
 And also, on the freeing yourself

36:24.920 --> 36:27.840
 of going beyond all postures, period,

36:28.920 --> 36:30.960
 working with the postures you have,

36:30.960 --> 36:35.280
 but towards a posture-less way of doing things.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.040
 So, this is something interesting to work,

36:38.040 --> 36:40.440
 when people work with movements,

36:40.440 --> 36:44.480
 but finally are able to go into movement

36:44.480 --> 36:46.240
 and this magic starts to happen

36:46.240 --> 36:48.520
 and then the techniques fall apart

36:48.520 --> 36:53.520
 and something appears and it's a phase change.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.800
 It's a transformation.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.360
 It's not a, it's a binary moment.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.800
 There is a jump there, for sure,

37:00.800 --> 37:03.400
 and it's very rare to see,

37:03.400 --> 37:06.840
 both in thinking and emotionally and in other ways.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.320
 We have many names for it

37:08.320 --> 37:10.600
 and some talk about enlightenment

37:10.600 --> 37:13.520
 and some talk about all kinds of processes related to it

37:13.520 --> 37:18.520
 and I think most of them are shadows of the sun,

37:18.600 --> 37:20.640
 but it's not the sun itself, really.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.520
 And then talking about ways of thinking about movement.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.960
 This is where I use something I call my slice and dice.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.880
 Because of the problem of using words and definitions

37:32.880 --> 37:36.640
 and categories, I try to create a lot of them

37:36.640 --> 37:39.200
 and I write them on the paper

37:39.200 --> 37:42.240
 and then I crumble them, throw them into the bin

37:42.240 --> 37:44.840
 and I keep doing it all my life.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.880
 The writing them down and the geeking on it

37:47.880 --> 37:51.000
 is very important, also very important to let it go.

37:52.200 --> 37:57.000
 I tell people, what you forgot is not the same,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.920
 forgetting is not the same as never knowing it.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.400
 The crumbling and throwing away is a form of forgetting,

38:03.400 --> 38:07.280
 but it leaves some kind of a homeopathic trace behind.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.400
 So let's take some slice and dice and try to look at it.

38:14.400 --> 38:18.880
 Here is a physical one, contraction, relaxation.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.840
 That's a spectrum

38:21.840 --> 38:24.840
 and pretty much everything falls on this spectrum.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.440
 Also in terms of analyzing a person or yourself,

38:28.440 --> 38:31.800
 you can tell me if you feel closer to this side

38:31.800 --> 38:33.920
 or closer to that side.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.200
 And then it allows you to examine your practices,

38:36.200 --> 38:40.960
 how many of the practices are moving you towards balance

38:40.960 --> 38:43.040
 and how many it's your addiction

38:43.040 --> 38:46.120
 of just doing what you're good at versus what you need.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.240
 Here is another example, physical culture.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.920
 So we have the dance, really,

38:53.920 --> 38:58.720
 working with internal concepts and expressing them,

38:58.720 --> 39:01.160
 abstract concepts, expression.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.960
 Second perspective, the martial concept,

39:05.960 --> 39:09.680
 but not in the sense of just fighting, but also partnering,

39:09.680 --> 39:11.800
 working with another person,

39:11.800 --> 39:15.400
 a dynamic entity that is communicating with you.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.440
 The third one is I call the elements,

39:17.440 --> 39:19.520
 working with the environment.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.520
 The next one is a somatic one,

39:23.520 --> 39:25.800
 is the internal practice.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.880
 And of course they are all gray zones

39:27.880 --> 39:31.240
 and another one is object manipulatory,

39:31.240 --> 39:33.120
 which you can think of it also as the environment,

39:33.120 --> 39:36.280
 but it's more small objects, heavy objects,

39:36.280 --> 39:37.960
 many objects, few objects.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.680
 And then you can look at this way of thinking

39:40.680 --> 39:43.720
 and you can say, oh, I have many of my practices

39:43.720 --> 39:45.320
 in this direction, but not so,

39:45.320 --> 39:47.760
 and you can draw it for yourself.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.360
 So that's another perspective.

39:49.360 --> 39:53.040
 And this way I use dozens of perspectives

39:53.040 --> 39:56.440
 and with the years, it gives people a sense

39:56.440 --> 39:58.880
 of where they want to go, how they want to do it,

39:58.880 --> 40:00.440
 and what they need to address

40:00.440 --> 40:02.880
 versus what they like to address, et cetera.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.720
 Is it helpful?

40:03.720 --> 40:04.640
 Very helpful.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.800
 Those different bins are very helpful.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.240
 I really appreciate that you mentioned

40:10.240 --> 40:12.880
 that people will often practice what they're good at

40:12.880 --> 40:14.640
 as opposed to what they need.

40:14.640 --> 40:19.200
 In gym culture, we refer to this as the guy

40:19.200 --> 40:22.400
 that always skips leg day type person, right?

40:22.400 --> 40:23.880
 Big upper body, skinny legs,

40:23.880 --> 40:27.320
 or you'll see people that have these enormous thick torsos

40:27.320 --> 40:28.600
 and they're bench pressing all day,

40:28.600 --> 40:31.520
 but they clearly need to pull on an object

40:31.520 --> 40:33.360
 every once in a while to create some balance,

40:33.360 --> 40:37.640
 but they don't do it because they, for whatever reason,

40:37.640 --> 40:40.200
 they have an obsession with moving greater and greater

40:40.200 --> 40:41.800
 poundage or something like that,

40:42.920 --> 40:45.800
 which in certain sports like powerlifting

40:45.800 --> 40:47.560
 where aesthetics aren't the goal

40:47.560 --> 40:49.920
 and it's simply to push more weight off one's chest,

40:49.920 --> 40:52.240
 you could imagine that there's something beneficial there.

40:52.240 --> 40:55.880
 However, I think that it's really important

40:55.880 --> 40:59.920
 in intellectual endeavors and in movement endeavors,

40:59.920 --> 41:00.920
 if I understand correctly,

41:00.920 --> 41:03.840
 to bring oneself to a place of real challenge

41:03.840 --> 41:05.480
 on a regular basis.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.720
 In fact, earlier today,

41:06.720 --> 41:08.240
 I was in a state of constant challenge

41:08.240 --> 41:09.840
 because it was all new to me.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.400
 And as much as I told myself, beginner's mind,

41:12.400 --> 41:15.800
 beginner's mind, beginner's mind, it's hard, I confess,

41:15.800 --> 41:18.440
 to not want to do well, to perform well, right?

41:18.440 --> 41:21.640
 And I think that's a natural and healthy thing.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.840
 Not only natural, it is necessary.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.440
 But I want you to keep it on that side

41:28.440 --> 41:31.320
 and to bring something to balance it.

41:31.320 --> 41:35.840
 If there is not this challenge, the process will not work.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.440
 It has to be this scale.

41:37.440 --> 41:40.240
 And you're talking about scales of pain, pleasure,

41:40.240 --> 41:42.920
 and this is another scale.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.320
 And this discomfort, again, is necessary

41:46.320 --> 41:49.880
 and should be recognized as I'm in the right place.

41:49.880 --> 41:54.600
 When it becomes too high and I'm unable to resolve

41:54.600 --> 41:59.360
 to make any progress, I went overboard.

41:59.360 --> 42:03.400
 But when it's not present, I don't do nothing here.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.280
 Nothing that I'm truly interested in.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.680
 I'm just gratifying myself.

42:07.680 --> 42:11.160
 Wankery is, in essence,

42:13.080 --> 42:15.800
 it's not about searching for the discomfort,

42:16.640 --> 42:17.640
 but it's a marker.

42:17.640 --> 42:22.640
 And I think the question should be,

42:24.120 --> 42:25.480
 who am I serving?

42:26.600 --> 42:29.640
 Because people do not serve themselves, in essence.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.800
 They serve part, parts of it.

42:33.800 --> 42:37.800
 Some kind of a fraction of themselves.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.560
 And this separation of oneself from oneself,

42:41.560 --> 42:46.000
 and this is also a result of the practice, a good practice.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.520
 I think maybe the biggest gift I received

42:50.520 --> 42:54.120
 from the practice is I can say,

42:54.120 --> 42:58.120
 although it will take maybe a certain context,

42:58.120 --> 42:59.280
 I am not my friend.

43:01.480 --> 43:05.080
 At times I am, but many times I am not my friend.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.160
 And by creating this separation,

43:07.160 --> 43:10.480
 I can assume a certain stability

43:10.480 --> 43:14.080
 in the face of everything all the way up

43:14.080 --> 43:16.280
 to our own mortality and death,

43:16.280 --> 43:19.640
 which is, and maybe beyond, who knows?

43:20.520 --> 43:24.120
 Yeah, it was a striking moment for me earlier today

43:24.120 --> 43:25.720
 when I was really challenged

43:25.720 --> 43:28.920
 with one of the practices we were doing.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.160
 And you said, this is exactly

43:31.160 --> 43:33.120
 what I experienced this morning, Andrew.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.160
 That's what you said.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.360
 And I couldn't imagine that you were having challenges

43:37.360 --> 43:38.920
 doing what I was attempting to do.

43:38.920 --> 43:39.880
 And of course you weren't.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.200
 I believe what you were referring to

43:41.200 --> 43:44.560
 is that you had put yourself at that edge earlier in the day

43:44.560 --> 43:46.840
 in which you were making failures.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.600
 You were failing to execute

43:48.600 --> 43:51.920
 the way that you were attempting to execute movement.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.360
 I should just, to inject some neuroscience

43:54.360 --> 43:57.400
 and neuroplasticity there, I can't help myself.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.040
 This is what I do after all.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.800
 There are beautiful data in animals and humans

44:01.800 --> 44:05.120
 showing that in the seconds and minutes

44:05.120 --> 44:09.160
 after a failed attempt at a motor execution of something,

44:09.160 --> 44:11.720
 the forebrain is in a heightened state of focus.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.400
 And when you hear it, it suddenly makes perfect sense.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.680
 Of course, why would the nervous system change

44:16.680 --> 44:18.880
 unless it got a cue to change?

44:18.880 --> 44:23.280
 And the cue almost always comes in the form of frustration.

44:23.280 --> 44:26.680
 The ah, or as we said earlier, nah.

44:26.680 --> 44:29.680
 The nah signal is the one that preps you

44:29.680 --> 44:33.680
 to extract more learning from the subsequent trials.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.400
 And yet for a lot of people, they feel that,

44:36.400 --> 44:38.440
 oh, that failure to execute

44:38.440 --> 44:42.080
 or even to approximate execution,

44:42.080 --> 44:46.480
 and they feel and experience that ah, negative signal,

44:46.480 --> 44:49.000
 and they lean out of the practice.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.520
 They start to depart either mentally or physically or both.

44:52.520 --> 44:55.880
 And if there's anything I think that perhaps we can offer

44:55.880 --> 44:58.320
 is this understanding that that edge, as some people call it,

44:58.320 --> 45:01.200
 or that failures aren't just necessary,

45:01.200 --> 45:03.720
 they are part of the learning process.

45:03.720 --> 45:07.680
 They are the entry gate to neuroplasticity.

45:07.680 --> 45:12.240
 Yes, contextualizing or re-contextualizing,

45:12.240 --> 45:15.280
 that sensation is something I work a lot with

45:15.280 --> 45:19.000
 and I just remind it to people, and I also remind it to myself.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.640
 And if it wasn't difficult

45:20.640 --> 45:23.680
 and we didn't need to redo it again and again,

45:23.680 --> 45:27.240
 we wouldn't be again on the correct scale,

45:27.240 --> 45:31.400
 which is dynamic and moving, just like rolling downhill.

45:31.400 --> 45:35.680
 So there is definitely a necessity to succeed, to orient.

45:35.680 --> 45:39.200
 There is certain aspects that you want to achieve,

45:39.200 --> 45:43.640
 but then there is also the letting go of it

45:43.640 --> 45:45.800
 and the de-ambitioning of it.

45:45.800 --> 45:51.440
 And within that tension, the plus and the minus comes movement.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.720
 And that's how the...

45:52.720 --> 45:55.080
 And again, if I stretch it too far away

45:55.080 --> 45:57.440
 or if I increase one of them too much,

45:57.440 --> 45:59.080
 then I would have some issues.

45:59.080 --> 46:01.640
 But you will, with practice,

46:01.640 --> 46:07.080
 learn to recognize the optimal point of progression.

46:07.080 --> 46:12.920
 Of course, it takes many years and a lot of play and exposure

46:12.920 --> 46:18.040
 to get a sense of it regardless of the layer in which it is applied.

46:18.040 --> 46:22.240
 So I'm sure in your field and in your pursuits,

46:22.240 --> 46:26.120
 you are already aware of it and applying it in your life,

46:26.120 --> 46:30.880
 talking about focus, talking about ways of thinking, creativity, etc.

46:30.880 --> 46:34.000
 But then it's enough that I pull into another perspective

46:34.000 --> 46:36.320
 and you will see that people are specialists

46:36.320 --> 46:42.080
 and then they don't have really the real essence of the concept.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.280
 It's not theirs.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.680
 It's applied specifically.

46:45.680 --> 46:49.680
 The one who changes all the time gets the general component

46:49.680 --> 46:52.520
 because what appears when everything changes,

46:52.520 --> 46:54.360
 that is that new entity.

46:54.360 --> 46:58.040
 Everything changes, something stays.

46:58.040 --> 47:02.760
 That's what we want to get, this concept and this understanding.

47:02.760 --> 47:06.280
 I've heard the statement before, we are just a meat vehicle, right?

47:06.280 --> 47:11.440
 We're just a sack of cells and I truly despise that statement

47:11.440 --> 47:16.600
 because first of all, it deprives us of all meaning of our lives

47:16.600 --> 47:20.040
 and we can go down the route of philosophy

47:20.040 --> 47:22.200
 as to whether or not there's meaning or not.

47:22.200 --> 47:25.280
 But more importantly, it divorces us from the idea

47:25.280 --> 47:27.080
 that the body and brain are interconnected

47:27.080 --> 47:30.920
 and have at least equal value at any one moment.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.120
 They're informing each other.

47:32.120 --> 47:35.760
 Emotions inform movement, movement informs emotions.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.680
 One thing that I've heard you say before

47:37.680 --> 47:40.920
 and I'd really love to hear you embellish on

47:40.920 --> 47:44.440
 is this important principle that human beings

47:44.440 --> 47:48.360
 are truly unique in terms of the enormous range of movements

47:48.360 --> 47:50.600
 that we can perform.

47:50.600 --> 47:54.640
 And yet we are excellent, maybe superior to all other species

47:54.640 --> 47:57.320
 at certain types of movement.

47:57.320 --> 48:00.760
 The one that comes to mind is walking, strides, striding.

48:00.760 --> 48:05.440
 So maybe we could just explore that idea

48:05.440 --> 48:08.760
 because obviously a cheetah is very fast.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.960
 The gibbon seems to have a lot of proficiency

48:10.960 --> 48:12.840
 at grabbing and swinging from branches,

48:14.440 --> 48:17.360
 but human beings perform an enormous

48:17.360 --> 48:19.920
 or can potentially perform an enormous array of movements.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.520
 Do you think all human beings are potentially able

48:22.520 --> 48:25.800
 to explore all the different types of movement?

48:27.160 --> 48:29.680
 And if so, how does one approach that?

48:29.680 --> 48:33.080
 So basically what I'm doing is I'm tabling a concept

48:33.080 --> 48:35.720
 which is not range of motion, right?

48:35.720 --> 48:38.560
 For the gym rats, discard with range of motion.

48:38.560 --> 48:42.000
 I'm talking about the variety of movements.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.360
 First, it's not important what I think,

48:47.360 --> 48:49.480
 if it's possible or not possible,

48:49.480 --> 48:53.520
 or if it's even possible for you or not possible for you.

48:53.520 --> 48:58.520
 What is important is what you truly want to do,

48:58.600 --> 49:00.440
 what you truly are after.

49:00.440 --> 49:02.640
 And it's important for me because many times

49:02.640 --> 49:06.680
 this way of thinking about things is already limited.

49:07.880 --> 49:12.400
 I like to say a man doesn't go to the ocean

49:12.400 --> 49:14.200
 to empty it with a spoon.

49:14.200 --> 49:19.200
 A lot of the types of dressing up of the concepts nowadays

49:20.560 --> 49:25.040
 is trying to fit an elephant into the hole in the needle.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.400
 Like for example, the concept of practice.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.480
 And then our lives, as if we have a life.

49:36.800 --> 49:41.320
 We have some kind of a stream of behaviors.

49:41.320 --> 49:45.000
 We have, there is an argument of free will, et cetera.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.080
 There is a multiplicity.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.400
 Definitely a man is a legion.

49:49.400 --> 49:52.160
 That's the real meaning of that phrase.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.800
 One day you wake up like this.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.280
 I say, Andrew, let's meet tomorrow at 7 a.m.,

49:58.280 --> 50:00.560
 but I don't know who's gonna wake up tomorrow.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.360
 And then you send me a text message.

50:04.800 --> 50:09.520
 I'm feeling off, right, at 6.55 and go back to sleep.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.280
 So, examining that and seeing that,

50:12.280 --> 50:14.200
 I think, frees you up eventually

50:14.200 --> 50:17.600
 and start to orient you in a better direction.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.320
 So, what do you want to do and what,

50:22.320 --> 50:25.520
 but in the orientation of also what you need to do,

50:25.520 --> 50:29.000
 what you sense and what you are developing

50:29.000 --> 50:32.840
 as an evolutionary direction for you.

50:32.840 --> 50:34.440
 This is the important bit.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.400
 Is it possible for everyone to engage

50:37.400 --> 50:39.400
 in certain specific physical movement?

50:39.400 --> 50:41.880
 For example, in Scandinavian countries,

50:41.880 --> 50:44.680
 the squat is not very approachable.

50:44.680 --> 50:48.800
 It's very difficult.

50:48.800 --> 50:51.720
 They're more built for dragging heavy things

50:51.720 --> 50:55.400
 and also in this climate, I guess,

50:55.400 --> 50:57.880
 it makes less sense to squat

50:57.880 --> 50:59.440
 because you're gonna freeze there.

50:59.440 --> 51:03.880
 So, this is, and then you see the squat in warm climates

51:03.880 --> 51:07.040
 and it's like so open and accessible.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.680
 They are very good deadlifters, usually.

51:10.840 --> 51:13.040
 Not good squatters and the-

51:13.040 --> 51:14.520
 They wanna get away from the ground.

51:14.520 --> 51:18.800
 Yeah, the shallow hip socket, which allows one activity,

51:18.800 --> 51:21.200
 but then the stability of the deep hip socket,

51:21.200 --> 51:23.600
 the architecture of the hip,

51:24.600 --> 51:28.360
 the femur heads, the cue angles, the shapes, et cetera.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.280
 So, we are all unique and there are certain elements,

51:31.280 --> 51:34.800
 which like, for example, my squat challenge is like,

51:34.800 --> 51:37.480
 for most people, there is something there.

51:37.480 --> 51:39.720
 But you remind people what the squat challenge is?

51:39.720 --> 51:44.400
 The squat was my attempt to bring a new,

51:44.400 --> 51:48.200
 fresh state of mind into the word squat.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.480
 Not as a strength element,

51:51.480 --> 51:55.600
 it's a fundamental resting position, really.

51:55.600 --> 51:58.040
 Actually should be one of the most abundant ones.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.920
 We replaced it with sitting,

52:00.920 --> 52:02.600
 which is not really, doesn't work well

52:02.600 --> 52:04.540
 if you're in a natural environment.

52:04.540 --> 52:06.080
 It's not very comfortable, actually,

52:06.080 --> 52:07.500
 to sit for long periods of time,

52:07.500 --> 52:09.140
 rocks and different terrains.

52:09.140 --> 52:13.360
 So, you end up lying down, standing, and squatting a lot.

52:13.360 --> 52:15.620
 Also, when you're moving low and dynamic,

52:15.620 --> 52:17.440
 like even collecting berries,

52:17.440 --> 52:20.920
 the squat is much more dynamic and open.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.000
 And then elimination is happening there.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.720
 So, it's like, it's such a fundamental thing

52:24.720 --> 52:26.880
 and we totally eliminated it.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.520
 We eliminated many other things,

52:28.520 --> 52:32.040
 overhead movements, behind the back,

52:32.040 --> 52:35.400
 all kinds of back realm, what I call the back realm.

52:35.400 --> 52:39.240
 It's totally absent in people's awareness.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.420
 So, that was my attempt to bring it back into people.

52:41.420 --> 52:46.420
 And I recommend it in order to really get the transformation

52:47.360 --> 52:52.120
 going to accumulate 30 minutes a day in the squat position,

52:52.120 --> 52:53.760
 unloaded, just resting down.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.200
 Not correct, not erect.

52:55.200 --> 52:56.720
 Many people make this mistake.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.720
 They didn't read through the whole thing.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.480
 It's just resting down there.

53:00.480 --> 53:03.280
 And of course, you have to be mindful of dosages.

53:03.280 --> 53:06.680
 Some people will get hurt if they try to do it too quickly.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.040
 So, they might need a build-up process towards it.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.760
 And also, I'm not talking about 30 minutes straight,

53:13.040 --> 53:15.360
 but accumulation throughout the day.

53:15.360 --> 53:18.680
 And this does a lot of good for digestive problems,

53:18.680 --> 53:22.600
 for lower back pain, for hip pains, for knees,

53:22.600 --> 53:24.680
 and generally for aging,

53:24.680 --> 53:28.760
 because it's basically folding your body

53:28.760 --> 53:30.000
 in the most basic way.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.040
 Are you folding your body?

53:31.040 --> 53:32.840
 If you're not folding your body,

53:32.840 --> 53:35.160
 you will lose the foldability of your body.

53:35.160 --> 53:38.080
 And this is probably the easiest

53:38.080 --> 53:40.160
 and the most abundant way to fold a body.

53:43.040 --> 53:46.240
 But this is an example of something that can be very useful

53:46.240 --> 53:47.520
 with many, many people,

53:47.520 --> 53:50.680
 but there will always be unique individuals

53:50.680 --> 53:52.640
 which need something else.

53:52.640 --> 53:57.640
 And there are benefits in examining things,

53:57.640 --> 54:01.040
 and also there are benefits in getting hurt,

54:01.040 --> 54:02.280
 which is not often discussed,

54:02.280 --> 54:03.840
 especially not in these parts.

54:04.840 --> 54:09.240
 So, I'm one of the only ones, as a teacher,

54:09.240 --> 54:11.640
 that says I injured many of my students.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.440
 And if I did not do that,

54:14.440 --> 54:18.760
 I would be totally useless for them as well.

54:18.760 --> 54:23.760
 The totally safe system has nothing to offer, practically.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.400
 Nothing is totally safe,

54:25.400 --> 54:27.680
 and we can, of course, we don't approach it

54:27.680 --> 54:30.080
 with a ballsy or machoistic thing,

54:30.080 --> 54:31.880
 but we are aware that sometimes

54:31.880 --> 54:33.520
 we have to go beyond the boundaries.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.160
 And hopefully those would be the small injuries

54:36.160 --> 54:38.840
 that will help us avoid the big injuries.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.600
 But if you try to avoid the small injuries,

54:40.600 --> 54:43.440
 maybe you'll get those big injuries in there.

54:43.440 --> 54:47.440
 So, examining which types and forms of movement,

54:47.440 --> 54:49.920
 the location of the body,

54:49.920 --> 54:51.840
 speed of execution,

54:51.840 --> 54:54.200
 the type of organization of the body.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.960
 Which is a whole thing that we can discuss.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.120
 All of this is up for the grabs,

55:00.120 --> 55:01.960
 and it's something that we have to create

55:01.960 --> 55:04.800
 individual relationship with,

55:04.800 --> 55:06.640
 hopefully with good guidance,

55:06.640 --> 55:10.480
 where we can get the right scenarios,

55:10.480 --> 55:13.520
 a facilitator of good scenarios for our learning,

55:13.520 --> 55:15.240
 which is what I try to do.

55:15.240 --> 55:17.200
 And less of a technical state of mind,

55:17.200 --> 55:21.200
 do this ABC or, yeah, like chunking,

55:21.200 --> 55:23.360
 what I really dislike.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.960
 Really dislike from a long time is like,

55:26.960 --> 55:28.760
 many people, they tell me,

55:28.760 --> 55:30.200
 have you met this guy?

55:30.200 --> 55:31.480
 He's an amazing teacher,

55:31.480 --> 55:34.120
 because he chunked the process into these bits,

55:34.120 --> 55:36.160
 and not even in the correct places to chunk.

55:36.160 --> 55:38.600
 It's like, and it doesn't offer,

55:38.600 --> 55:40.920
 it locks us, this state of mind.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.000
 I talk about the chemistry model.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.320
 I call it my chemistry model,

55:44.320 --> 55:47.320
 where an atom, a molecule,

55:47.320 --> 55:49.360
 and then a compound is conceptualized

55:49.360 --> 55:50.920
 versus just chunking.

55:50.920 --> 55:53.080
 So there is an actual evolution,

55:53.080 --> 55:56.560
 like I call it also sketch learning.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.720
 I'm not going to try to draw you,

55:58.720 --> 56:01.280
 if I know anything about art and drawing.

56:01.280 --> 56:04.280
 I'm going to start by capturing something very rough.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.120
 And I need to practice that first,

56:06.120 --> 56:10.120
 that dynamic entity before I go into the rendering

56:10.120 --> 56:11.640
 and the shading, et cetera.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.280
 So the same way to learn things.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.600
 So big picture to small details.

56:18.600 --> 56:22.280
 And unlike many of my teachers that I ran into,

56:22.280 --> 56:25.120
 and I say with the greatest respect,

56:25.120 --> 56:26.840
 because I don't know who taught me more,

56:26.840 --> 56:29.040
 my good teachers or my worst teachers.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.880
 But some of them just teach from the small details

56:32.880 --> 56:35.640
 into a big picture that never arrives.

56:35.640 --> 56:39.440
 Given that humans can generate such a broad array

56:39.440 --> 56:43.320
 of types of movement, run, jump, duck, squat, leap,

56:43.320 --> 56:45.720
 all these types of movements,

56:45.720 --> 56:48.040
 do you think there's value in observing the movements

56:48.040 --> 56:49.280
 of other animal species?

56:49.280 --> 56:53.160
 I know I certainly enjoy watching other animals move.

56:54.840 --> 56:59.160
 I think the most, one of the more spectacular animal facts

56:59.160 --> 57:02.080
 that was shared with me is when I was a graduate student,

57:02.080 --> 57:05.240
 someone down the hall was working on the little pedals

57:05.240 --> 57:09.320
 of the chameleon, which can walk up walls.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.280
 And it was a great mystery is whether or not

57:11.280 --> 57:13.240
 they were suction, but it turns out they can do it

57:13.240 --> 57:15.040
 in a vacuum, so it's not suction.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.640
 Whether or not there was some sticky substance.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.680
 And it turned out, I don't know,

57:18.680 --> 57:20.000
 I feel compelled to share this with you,

57:20.000 --> 57:21.840
 so I'm going to do it because I have a feeling

57:21.840 --> 57:24.480
 it will lead us to an insight of some sort,

57:24.480 --> 57:27.320
 that those little tiny pedals are so thin

57:27.320 --> 57:31.520
 and so close together that the chameleon actually sticks

57:31.520 --> 57:34.480
 to the wall by what are called van der Waal forces,

57:34.480 --> 57:36.520
 meaning it's a very weak molecular force,

57:36.520 --> 57:38.600
 but strong enough to stick to the wall

57:38.600 --> 57:40.880
 because they are actually exchanging molecules

57:40.880 --> 57:43.040
 with the surface they're on.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.040
 So obviously we can't do that.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.760
 And yet I spent hours,

57:48.760 --> 57:50.280
 because they were in the lab next door,

57:50.280 --> 57:53.120
 watching videos of these little chameleons walk.

57:53.120 --> 57:56.720
 And the articulation of these feet is incredible

57:56.720 --> 57:59.720
 because they're literally rolling those little pedals along

57:59.720 --> 58:04.360
 in a way that kind of defies anything else I've ever seen.

58:04.360 --> 58:06.600
 I told myself this was useful,

58:06.600 --> 58:07.920
 A, because I thought it was interesting,

58:07.920 --> 58:10.040
 but B, because I never really thought

58:10.040 --> 58:12.080
 about how I articulate my foot.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.520
 I've thought about being a heel striker

58:13.520 --> 58:14.900
 or a toe striker when I run,

58:14.900 --> 58:17.440
 and no one can tell me which one I'm supposed to be.

58:17.440 --> 58:18.720
 Maybe you can tell me.

58:18.720 --> 58:23.720
 But the point is, or I suppose the question is,

58:23.720 --> 58:26.640
 do you think there's value in observing the extremes

58:26.640 --> 58:30.620
 of animal kingdom movement as a way to inform the play space

58:30.620 --> 58:31.920
 and the exploration space

58:31.920 --> 58:34.320
 of our own human movement practice?

58:35.640 --> 58:36.480
 I think so.

58:36.480 --> 58:40.480
 I think first it's inspiring, it opens up,

58:40.480 --> 58:44.200
 it opens up, but I will take it away

58:44.200 --> 58:47.360
 from the romantic point of view,

58:47.360 --> 58:50.260
 and I would offer another way to examine

58:50.260 --> 58:55.260
 all these movements existing us in ways, in certain ways,

58:56.240 --> 58:59.480
 like the work of Grokovetsky on the spine,

58:59.480 --> 59:04.480
 the spinal engine, and to see how these old ways

59:06.480 --> 59:09.240
 of moving, even all the way up to exoskeletons

59:09.240 --> 59:14.240
 and primary, very ancient, or even single-cell things

59:15.880 --> 59:17.860
 are still within us to a certain extent.

59:17.860 --> 59:20.600
 And then, of course, this gets developed,

59:22.400 --> 59:26.400
 like the Darwinian state of mind got stuck

59:26.400 --> 59:29.280
 for many years on the survival of the fittest.

59:30.360 --> 59:33.160
 But actually, I always believed,

59:33.160 --> 59:36.160
 and I saw some information about it lately,

59:36.160 --> 59:39.380
 that mutation is the heart of the model,

59:39.380 --> 59:41.200
 not survival of the fittest.

59:41.200 --> 59:43.240
 Yeah, people often hear the word mutation

59:43.240 --> 59:45.340
 and they think, well, mutations are bad.

59:45.340 --> 59:47.940
 There are maladaptive mutations,

59:47.940 --> 59:50.760
 and then there are adaptive mutations, for sure.

59:50.760 --> 59:54.520
 And in these places, the word change in the heart of it,

59:54.520 --> 59:58.200
 what it wants to do, change.

59:58.200 --> 1:00:00.960
 So it does not want to become better.

1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:05.960
 There is an inherent change in it.

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:11.440
 And then, of course, the become better at XYZ fittest

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:14.340
 is the secondary perspective that arrives

1:00:14.340 --> 1:00:15.780
 in relation to certain things,

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.840
 but there is still a stronger, more ancient driving force

1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:20.800
 into the process.

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:24.400
 So for me, this is cool to see these animals

1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:26.680
 take it all the way to this extreme,

1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:29.640
 but it's also still reflecting within us.

1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:31.520
 So I love to do, like, for example,

1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:34.480
 I introduce with people spinal waves.

1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:37.520
 And by bringing these waves into the body,

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:40.700
 sometimes you get weird experiences,

1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:45.260
 like emotional releases, and other times,

1:00:45.260 --> 1:00:48.720
 it can become an incredible tool to help an athlete

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:51.760
 which specialized and reached the top of the top,

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:54.960
 and then you defrag his system a little bit

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:59.360
 and offer him some freshness and some segmental movement,

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:01.720
 and first you fuck him up.

1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:03.480
 That's usually the case.

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:05.920
 Technically, he's off, his coordination's off,

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:08.840
 but later, the growth will arrive.

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.600
 It's a form of playfulness.

1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:12.920
 It's a form of examining things

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:15.360
 regardless of their success or failure,

1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:18.380
 more understanding that change is important.

1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:21.260
 And then after that, we can also look at

1:01:21.260 --> 1:01:24.360
 the more competitive state of mind

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:27.360
 and the more success and failure orientation.

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:30.760
 But there is no game without change.

1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:33.560
 So this is the primary one.

1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:35.920
 And that's why I say, okay, you want to succeed

1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:38.080
 in the tasks like we did earlier,

1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:40.640
 but you stayed within the game, to sustain the game,

1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:44.920
 the infinite versus finite game, right, perspective.

1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:49.180
 To sustain the game means to continue to change,

1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:53.700
 continue to transform, and then to win the game

1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:55.280
 sometimes means game over.

1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:59.860
 So it's like, yeah, within that tension,

1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:04.500
 I think it's beautiful to play and to exist and to be.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:06.140
 You mentioned something that for me

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:09.640
 is an incredibly important concept for a couple of reasons.

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.800
 And you mentioned these spinal waves, right?

1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:15.020
 I have to assume that's taking the torso for us,

1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:18.140
 you know, movement morons that I'll just refer to

1:02:18.140 --> 1:02:21.180
 in coarse terms instead of thoracic spine.

1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:23.380
 I mean, we'll stay away from the technical anatomy

1:02:23.380 --> 1:02:27.580
 and the torso and creating movement either side to side,

1:02:27.580 --> 1:02:32.220
 undulation or arching and extension of the spine.

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:34.660
 Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side to side,

1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:36.660
 rotational as well as spiraling.

1:02:39.940 --> 1:02:43.180
 Have you ever had the experience of yourself

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:45.340
 or other people engaging in those types of movements

1:02:45.340 --> 1:02:48.740
 and experiencing particular categories of emotions?

1:02:48.740 --> 1:02:50.460
 And I have a particular reason for asking this.

1:02:50.460 --> 1:02:51.900
 There's no right or wrong answer, of course,

1:02:51.900 --> 1:02:55.220
 but I'm just curious whether or not movement of the,

1:02:55.220 --> 1:02:56.640
 let's call it the core of the body,

1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:58.980
 things close to the midline as opposed to far away

1:02:58.980 --> 1:03:01.220
 from the midline, like the digits far.

1:03:01.220 --> 1:03:03.500
 Is there any, do you have any evidence

1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:07.960
 that that can evoke a certain category of emotional states?

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:10.820
 Evidence, I have none, but I have experience

1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:12.760
 and I have some thoughts about it.

1:03:14.220 --> 1:03:18.980
 Ida Rolf is known to have created Rolfing

1:03:18.980 --> 1:03:20.200
 or structural integration,

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:23.060
 as I said, the issues are in the tissues.

1:03:23.060 --> 1:03:27.660
 And around the spine, the spine is us, as you know.

1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:30.100
 It's like you can take an arm off a limb,

1:03:30.100 --> 1:03:35.100
 but there's been attempts, but there is no brainy alone,

1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:38.420
 this cerebral thing alone,

1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:42.240
 that the spine and maybe more parts of end systems

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:44.020
 inside the torso are important.

1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:46.820
 So that's why I like to start from that core entity.

1:03:46.820 --> 1:03:49.660
 And then these little fluctuations,

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:54.660
 they create, they unblock things,

1:03:55.140 --> 1:03:56.820
 they start to move things,

1:03:56.820 --> 1:03:59.740
 and you can avoid, funny enough,

1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:04.620
 mobilizing those areas by doing big frame motions

1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:07.540
 and competitive motions and techniques all your life.

1:04:08.500 --> 1:04:11.220
 So even some, most yogis, for example,

1:04:11.220 --> 1:04:13.580
 they look extremely mobile,

1:04:13.580 --> 1:04:16.220
 but then when you're actually going into the small,

1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:17.640
 what I call the small frame,

1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:20.220
 I borrowed this from Chinese martial arts,

1:04:20.220 --> 1:04:21.580
 small frame, big frame.

1:04:21.580 --> 1:04:24.620
 The big frame is these big changes

1:04:24.620 --> 1:04:28.260
 of our total body in space posture.

1:04:28.260 --> 1:04:30.380
 And then the small frame is barely moving,

1:04:30.380 --> 1:04:32.420
 but mobilizing the little bits

1:04:32.420 --> 1:04:35.800
 that comprise the same pretty much posture.

1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:37.220
 So these are very beneficial,

1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:41.740
 and it has totally disappeared from our physical culture.

1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.280
 When you introduce it back,

1:04:44.780 --> 1:04:47.180
 the small frame offers the big frame,

1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:49.420
 but the big frame doesn't offer the small frame

1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:51.580
 because, of course, the small detail

1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:53.460
 come together into the big picture.

1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:56.100
 So if I wanna place my body in a specific position

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:58.160
 and I have all these bits moving well,

1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:00.820
 I can construct it in whatever way I want.

1:05:00.820 --> 1:05:02.680
 But if I just work on the big one,

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:07.420
 most chances are I just mobilize certain areas

1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:11.060
 while other areas are totally held or blocked,

1:05:11.060 --> 1:05:14.580
 and then I'm specialized one more time.

1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:17.880
 Take me out of this realm and I'll have difficulties.

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:20.300
 What will sit there in this stagnation?

1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:25.120
 Emotion, material, thoughts, traumas.

1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:27.440
 That's why people get discharges.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:32.520
 The body, the memory is not what we think it is.

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:33.360
 That's how I believe.

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:36.780
 It is stored everywhere.

1:05:38.300 --> 1:05:40.620
 And I've had those experiences.

1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:42.640
 A lot of people have the opposite.

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:45.060
 When a certain emotion is evoked,

1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:47.060
 they start to undulate the spine.

1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:50.340
 So this can be worked from this direction

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:51.300
 or from this direction,

1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:55.460
 and I believe by applying such a practice,

1:05:57.180 --> 1:05:58.840
 it is wise.

1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:01.540
 You basically turn over the land

1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:06.380
 and you are allowing things to shift

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:08.360
 and to move and to adapt.

1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:09.940
 So I highly recommend it,

1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:13.760
 and we teach it in a very elaborate and gradual way.

1:06:15.420 --> 1:06:18.140
 And this is needed really because people,

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:20.860
 when they just go into some general recommendation,

1:06:20.860 --> 1:06:23.340
 they usually just get stuck into a new pattern.

1:06:23.340 --> 1:06:25.500
 Ah, that spinal wave, okay.

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:26.340
 That's it.

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:28.060
 So I've been using, again, these slice and dice,

1:06:28.060 --> 1:06:31.700
 like teaching dozens of systems of moving the torso

1:06:31.700 --> 1:06:35.020
 until a person is freed to really move the torso,

1:06:35.020 --> 1:06:36.860
 like the language is created,

1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:40.720
 the small enough units are created in your understanding

1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:43.620
 from all these systems, and then you improvise.

1:06:43.620 --> 1:06:45.820
 You reach the highest level of the practice.

1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:48.420
 I love the answer.

1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:51.320
 Let me tell you a bit of why I asked.

1:06:52.540 --> 1:06:56.440
 So there's a principle in neuroscience,

1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:59.940
 but especially in neuroevolution, they call it evo-devo,

1:06:59.940 --> 1:07:02.540
 sometimes evolution and development, how those link.

1:07:02.540 --> 1:07:05.060
 If you look at, so we have motor neurons, as you know,

1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:07.220
 but for the audience that live in our spinal cord

1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:09.660
 that cause transmission and contraction of the muscles

1:07:09.660 --> 1:07:11.460
 allow us to move our limbs.

1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:13.020
 And then we have motor neurons up here

1:07:13.020 --> 1:07:15.060
 called upper motor neurons that control the motor,

1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:15.900
 lower ones.

1:07:15.900 --> 1:07:17.500
 So once something is reflexive or learned,

1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:19.700
 we're not thinking about it, so to speak.

1:07:19.700 --> 1:07:21.340
 We mainly use the lower motor neurons.

1:07:21.340 --> 1:07:23.220
 We know this because you can do an experiment.

1:07:23.220 --> 1:07:24.580
 It's a rather barbaric experiment,

1:07:24.580 --> 1:07:26.600
 but it's been done many times,

1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:28.900
 called creating a decerebrate cat.

1:07:28.900 --> 1:07:30.860
 You actually remove the neocortex,

1:07:30.860 --> 1:07:32.980
 and these cats will walk on a treadmill.

1:07:32.980 --> 1:07:34.380
 It's called fictive motion.

1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:35.520
 No problem at all.

1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:38.380
 There are human beings who don't have a neocortex,

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:40.380
 or much of their neocortex is missing.

1:07:40.380 --> 1:07:42.620
 They generate perfectly fine movement.

1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:44.260
 The pattern has been downloaded.

1:07:44.260 --> 1:07:45.100
 That's right.

1:07:45.100 --> 1:07:47.840
 And it's truly downloaded into the spine

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:49.940
 and the connection between the spine and muscles.

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:53.820
 Now, the motor neurons that control the spinal waves,

1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:58.260
 as you call them, are of a particular category.

1:07:58.260 --> 1:08:01.180
 They have a molecular signature, a physiological signature.

1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:03.380
 They were identified by, he's dead now,

1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:07.100
 but a biologist at Columbia University named Tom Jessel

1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:08.960
 and many of his scientific offspring.

1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:10.680
 Here's what's interesting.

1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:14.940
 In fish or in animals that really only have the opportunity

1:08:14.940 --> 1:08:19.000
 to undulate and flap their little, you know, fins,

1:08:20.540 --> 1:08:24.540
 the motor neurons that control undulation in those animals

1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:27.000
 are identical molecularly to the motor neurons

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.560
 that control the spinal undulation in humans.

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:32.900
 What's been added in human evolution

1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:35.020
 are extra rows, literally,

1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:37.340
 categories of molecularly distinct neurons

1:08:37.340 --> 1:08:40.680
 so that as you move from the center of the body outward,

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.480
 unlike a fish, which can move its fins,

1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:45.860
 but can't actually, it doesn't have digits,

1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:49.020
 we have special motor neurons to move these little bits,

1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:53.020
 these bits, these bits, and I can't do a spinal wave,

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:57.400
 but I can do the mudras thing, like the belly thing.

1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:59.860
 That comes from seeing the movie E.T. when I was a kid

1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:01.700
 and puffing out my stomach and then realizing

1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:04.340
 that I could wave it, but only in one direction

1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:05.820
 and currently not up.

1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:10.540
 Anyway, the yogis out there can chuckle at that, but-

1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:12.460
 The yogis actually do it to the side.

1:09:12.460 --> 1:09:13.300
 Oh, do they?

1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:14.120
 Yeah.

1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:15.540
 I don't know if I can do that.

1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:19.540
 Anyway, my spinal wave is weak, but I'll work on it.

1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:23.500
 But what I find so interesting about these layers of,

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:24.980
 I don't want to say sophistication,

1:09:24.980 --> 1:09:28.720
 but with evolution came the addition

1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:30.900
 of more pools of opportunity.

1:09:30.900 --> 1:09:32.420
 These motor neuron pools, as they're called,

1:09:32.420 --> 1:09:35.140
 are opportunity to engage in new,

1:09:35.140 --> 1:09:36.980
 more elaborate types of movement.

1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:39.760
 But with each new pool became the opportunity

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.740
 to create combinations of new movement.

1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:45.300
 And so the reason I asked you why spinal waves

1:09:45.300 --> 1:09:47.500
 create one category of movement is that

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:50.220
 if you touch a fish on one side of its body,

1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:51.880
 it moves to the opposite side.

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:53.540
 It never moves toward it.

1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:55.780
 But earlier we were doing a practice somewhat similar

1:09:55.780 --> 1:09:58.200
 of testing this similar reflex.

1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:02.900
 And sometimes I or someone will move toward a touch.

1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:05.540
 We don't deviate to the opposite side.

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:10.540
 So I have this untested, at least formally tested hypothesis

1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:16.540
 that movements of small digits and portions of our distal,

1:10:16.540 --> 1:10:19.680
 as they're called, far from the midline body parts,

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.600
 evoke different sensations,

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:23.800
 maybe even far more subtle sensations

1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:25.780
 than movements of the core of our body

1:10:25.780 --> 1:10:29.140
 and the stuff closer to the spine.

1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:30.540
 Again, it's just a theory,

1:10:30.540 --> 1:10:33.340
 but I'm grateful for your answer

1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:36.180
 because it lands at least in the general vector direction

1:10:36.180 --> 1:10:39.540
 of my idea here.

1:10:39.540 --> 1:10:44.540
 The central orientation is mostly gone from our culture.

1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:47.960
 We don't even walk, basically, these days.

1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:49.780
 If you look at traditional culture,

1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:53.020
 the amount of walking you do on a rest day,

1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:54.020
 it's huge.

1:10:54.020 --> 1:10:57.660
 And so we started to create technologies

1:10:57.660 --> 1:11:00.540
 to bring everything into the periphery,

1:11:00.540 --> 1:11:02.700
 controlling it with the fingertips, et cetera.

1:11:02.700 --> 1:11:05.900
 So we have incredible neurological development

1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:09.860
 relating to this, but our central patterns,

1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:13.740
 swimming, running, jumping, throwing,

1:11:13.740 --> 1:11:15.860
 throwing is not pushing away.

1:11:15.860 --> 1:11:17.180
 That's an example, right?

1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:19.500
 Some people, when you give them a ball to throw,

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:21.220
 you can tell if they've never thrown a ball before.

1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:23.460
 Yeah, they throw like a girl.

1:11:23.460 --> 1:11:25.340
 That is often said here in the US.

1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:26.780
 And it's, of course, unfair,

1:11:26.780 --> 1:11:29.500
 but it relates to experience, right?

1:11:29.500 --> 1:11:34.380
 That is less maybe promoted or offered for females.

1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:37.860
 So you get this peripheral pattern

1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:40.420
 instead of a central generated pattern

1:11:40.420 --> 1:11:43.140
 that progresses towards the extremities.

1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:48.100
 One thing I wanted to ask you is,

1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:51.500
 I know an area that is not often mentioned

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:54.500
 is that some of these ancient patterns and systems

1:11:55.660 --> 1:11:57.780
 are primary in many ways.

1:11:57.780 --> 1:12:01.460
 Hence, those newer developments inside of us

1:12:01.460 --> 1:12:04.660
 are constrained by using the connections

1:12:04.660 --> 1:12:06.980
 running through these ancient systems.

1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:11.980
 Hence, we are much more limited by the gene pool.

1:12:15.460 --> 1:12:19.860
 We are hitchhikers on a piece of DNA, I like to say.

1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:23.940
 And that gene pool is driving something so primary

1:12:23.940 --> 1:12:28.740
 that even when you are in kind of the driver's seat

1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:30.860
 in your eyes, you're actually not,

1:12:30.860 --> 1:12:34.340
 or you're being totally constrained by that.

1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:37.780
 And I wanted to hear about this.

1:12:37.780 --> 1:12:41.460
 Yeah, recently we had a guest on the podcast

1:12:41.460 --> 1:12:42.420
 named Eric Jarvis.

1:12:42.420 --> 1:12:44.340
 He's a professor at Rockefeller

1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:47.380
 who was offered a position to dance

1:12:47.380 --> 1:12:49.020
 with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company.

1:12:49.020 --> 1:12:51.820
 So an accomplished dancer and comes from a musical family,

1:12:51.820 --> 1:12:53.500
 chose to become a neuroscientist instead

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:55.100
 and study speech and language.

1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:56.580
 But he said something incredible,

1:12:56.580 --> 1:12:58.260
 several incredible things.

1:12:58.260 --> 1:13:00.860
 Really looking forward to getting your reflections on.

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:05.820
 First of all, he said that when you look at the species

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:09.100
 in the kingdom of animals, including us,

1:13:09.100 --> 1:13:12.880
 that have elaborate language and true song,

1:13:14.140 --> 1:13:18.060
 they all also have the capacity to dance.

1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:20.780
 All the, it turns out hummingbirds actually have a dance

1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:25.180
 and a song capacity that perhaps,

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:27.620
 and this is the going idea now in neuroscience

1:13:27.620 --> 1:13:29.620
 and evolution of the brain,

1:13:29.620 --> 1:13:34.620
 that singing actually came before finally articulated

1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:36.320
 speech and language.

1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:39.540
 That voice involved first to sing, to communicate.

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:43.100
 I mean, to enunciate, ugh, or ugh, or you know, or mm.

1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:46.220
 But then song may have come first.

1:13:46.220 --> 1:13:49.020
 Where you have song, you have dance

1:13:49.020 --> 1:13:50.120
 and the capacity to dance,

1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:52.060
 which of course is movement of the body.

1:13:52.060 --> 1:13:54.300
 And where you have song and dance,

1:13:54.300 --> 1:13:56.660
 you always find that those species

1:13:56.660 --> 1:13:58.940
 can generate elaborate language.

1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:01.500
 Now, the simple version of this is, okay,

1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:03.820
 sophisticated brains tend to create clusters

1:14:03.820 --> 1:14:07.060
 of sophisticated capabilities, but the other possibility,

1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:08.700
 and it's the one that Jarvis proposes,

1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:10.860
 and I think it's in line with what you're perhaps

1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:14.420
 raising here, is the idea that movement of the body

1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:17.760
 and range and sophistication of movement of the body

1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:20.060
 through all these different systems

1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:24.140
 may have actually promoted or even driven the evolution

1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:27.860
 of the things that we think of as, you know,

1:14:27.860 --> 1:14:32.140
 speech and language and the ability to have multiple words

1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:34.660
 for the same concept or to have elaborate

1:14:34.660 --> 1:14:36.240
 articulation of speech.

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:39.500
 I find this incredibly attractive as an idea

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:43.220
 because certainly from, as a hierarchy of needs,

1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:45.620
 we needed to move first to survive and to mate

1:14:45.620 --> 1:14:47.460
 and to flee and to attack.

1:14:48.300 --> 1:14:49.940
 It makes perfect sense to me that the layers

1:14:49.940 --> 1:14:52.580
 would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind

1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:55.160
 and not the other way around.

1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:56.200
 So that's one piece.

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:59.280
 And then the other piece, which I'll just share

1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:00.660
 for any reflections you might have,

1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:05.660
 that just blew me away was Jarvis told me that when we read,

1:15:08.180 --> 1:15:10.500
 if, and this has been done experimentally,

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:14.540
 if one records the EMG, the low level muscular activity

1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:16.100
 in the larynx and pharynx,

1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:19.580
 we are actually repeating the words that we read,

1:15:19.580 --> 1:15:23.660
 but so subtly so that we don't actually speak them out

1:15:23.660 --> 1:15:26.140
 unless there's some sort of neurologic deficit,

1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:27.280
 which some people have.

1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:28.520
 Some people mumble why they read,

1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:33.040
 but what that tells me is that language is movement

1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:35.060
 and movement is language.

1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:37.180
 So again, we have this convergence,

1:15:37.180 --> 1:15:39.180
 but at a very basic level,

1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:42.020
 I'd love your reflections on, those are all his ideas.

1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:44.180
 I want to say, I'm just repeating what he said

1:15:44.180 --> 1:15:47.540
 and not nearly as precisely as he did,

1:15:47.540 --> 1:15:51.160
 but how do you think of movement

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:54.500
 as either the foundation of language

1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:58.640
 or as its own language that perhaps even defies words?

1:16:01.700 --> 1:16:04.860
 Wow, those are beautiful perspectives

1:16:04.860 --> 1:16:07.280
 and I definitely feel the same.

1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:11.200
 There's a lot to say about singing and dancing as well

1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:16.200
 and also as a form of ancient programs of transmission.

1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:24.520
 Sometimes there is this, in some ancient practices,

1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:29.520
 the mantras and people don't realize

1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:33.840
 that they are tantric practices.

1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:38.520
 They contain a form of vibrating and breathing

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:45.560
 all tied together into a very elaborate way

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:48.020
 to promote a certain effect.

1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:50.480
 And how would you do something like this in ancient times?

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:52.120
 This is ingenious.

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:54.480
 We, even until today, we need a full book

1:16:54.480 --> 1:16:55.320
 to describe something like this

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:57.440
 and it wouldn't work as well.

1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.500
 So it's like a very ancient form of transmission.

1:17:00.500 --> 1:17:05.160
 The more accurate we became with the language,

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:08.680
 the more dead it became

1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:12.560
 because it is less of a movement entity.

1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:15.880
 It is less of a dynamic entity from its nature.

1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.720
 And that's why Yukio Mishima says it's corrupting.

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:20.960
 It corrupts us.

1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:26.320
 So definitely, definitely the,

1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:30.800
 the conducing force or the primary force for me

1:17:30.800 --> 1:17:34.880
 is movement that is experienced.

1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:37.160
 Every time we talk about movement,

1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:41.200
 basically, even now, we are spilling it into a container

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:44.540
 to call it what it is, but it is beyond that.

1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:49.000
 So then it is applied into dancing,

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.160
 into singing, into language.

1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:56.160
 There is no other language that I see as a primary mode.

1:17:56.460 --> 1:18:01.360
 And this is a nature of space, time, things moving.

1:18:03.340 --> 1:18:07.260
 So I think everything moves into the direction

1:18:07.260 --> 1:18:09.420
 of understanding that more and more.

1:18:09.420 --> 1:18:12.980
 And maybe it's not so popular to call it movement.

1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:15.740
 People have some connotations and it's okay.

1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:17.880
 You can throw away this word and put another word

1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:20.820
 and we probably need to do that also, like regularly.

1:18:20.820 --> 1:18:24.080
 Like, I start to see the end of this word for me.

1:18:25.460 --> 1:18:29.080
 Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:32.800
 and then we need a new word.

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:36.700
 And that's, even that word is only needed for communication

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:41.460
 and for specific processes of education, exchange.

1:18:41.460 --> 1:18:44.300
 It's important to stay within the experiences.

1:18:44.300 --> 1:18:47.160
 It's important to continue to promote scenarios

1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:49.420
 in which the experience is primary.

1:18:49.420 --> 1:18:52.780
 A more open experience, let's say,

1:18:52.780 --> 1:18:57.780
 and not try to hold down and define overly accurately,

1:18:59.820 --> 1:19:03.440
 or if it's done, throwing it away and starting again.

1:19:04.380 --> 1:19:05.920
 So there is no winning concept.

1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:08.320
 You got to the winning concept, you got nothing.

1:19:09.860 --> 1:19:12.740
 You were able to grab it, you were able to,

1:19:12.740 --> 1:19:14.600
 this is very science, right?

1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:16.600
 Like, we got it, we got it.

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:19.260
 And then it turns out to be nothing.

1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:23.180
 And more and more time passes,

1:19:23.180 --> 1:19:26.740
 I feel science is becoming more humble

1:19:26.740 --> 1:19:31.740
 and things are being discussed in this way.

1:19:32.180 --> 1:19:37.180
 And because really what the science do,

1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:41.820
 report the sun came up a certain amount

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:45.180
 of billions of times and then tomorrow

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.580
 it will come up again, statistics.

1:19:47.580 --> 1:19:49.460
 Yeah, it's good prediction.

1:19:49.460 --> 1:19:51.480
 Yeah, but we can go beyond.

1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:54.740
 There is something inside of us that can go beyond.

1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:58.020
 Hard to communicate, I can't offer it right now here,

1:19:58.020 --> 1:20:01.540
 but I have the experience and thankfully I have a practice

1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:05.740
 and a way to sense it, to feel it, and to re-examine it.

1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:09.500
 And then we can talk about it and have something from that.

1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:13.260
 Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist,

1:20:13.260 --> 1:20:15.060
 he actually founded the field of sociobiology,

1:20:15.060 --> 1:20:17.700
 E.O. Wilson, they call him Edward Wilson,

1:20:17.700 --> 1:20:20.300
 had this beautiful word and indeed named a book.

1:20:20.300 --> 1:20:22.500
 Actually the word was better than the book, sorry Wilson,

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:25.580
 but the book was a little bit meandering for my taste.

1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:29.060
 But then again, he's the Harvard professor, not me.

1:20:29.060 --> 1:20:30.980
 Well, Stanford's pretty darn good.

1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:35.300
 This word is consilience, this idea of a leaping together

1:20:35.300 --> 1:20:37.040
 of divergent forms of knowledge

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:40.980
 to create a truly valuable concept, which I love.

1:20:40.980 --> 1:20:43.220
 I love it because of course I'm formally trained

1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:44.740
 as a scientist, I look at things mainly

1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:45.860
 through the lens of neuroscience,

1:20:45.860 --> 1:20:50.860
 but experience is real and observation is real.

1:20:51.460 --> 1:20:52.920
 And even in the field of medicine,

1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:56.300
 you have double blind placebo controlled clinical trials

1:20:56.300 --> 1:21:01.100
 and then you have case studies, N of one, right?

1:21:01.100 --> 1:21:02.360
 Not often discussed, right?

1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:06.280
 I mean, H.M., the most famous example in neuroscience

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:09.720
 of a patient that had no hippocampus informed us more

1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:11.860
 about the process of memory and indeed the function

1:21:11.860 --> 1:21:15.380
 of the hippocampus than thousands

1:21:15.380 --> 1:21:17.420
 of independent experiments that followed.

1:21:17.420 --> 1:21:20.680
 So you can't have one, you need all these different forms

1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:25.260
 of exploration, which is, I think we share the belief,

1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:28.540
 if I may, that convergent forms of knowledge,

1:21:28.540 --> 1:21:30.940
 eventually this process of consilience

1:21:30.940 --> 1:21:33.460
 can eject a new concept.

1:21:33.460 --> 1:21:36.460
 And yet the challenge again is that if we don't have

1:21:36.460 --> 1:21:38.860
 a language for it, it becomes hard to transmit.

1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:43.860
 One of the things that I find incredibly,

1:21:44.340 --> 1:21:46.040
 I'll use this word again, sticky,

1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:48.600
 is this notion of movement culture.

1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:50.260
 I don't know who coined that phrase,

1:21:50.260 --> 1:21:53.560
 or I've seen it in the circles and accounts

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:56.160
 around your Instagram account and others,

1:21:56.160 --> 1:21:58.860
 I don't know if that's a phrase that you coined,

1:21:58.860 --> 1:22:01.960
 but this idea of engaging in movement practice with others,

1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:05.400
 whether or not it's dance or other movement practices,

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:09.040
 because it's so dynamic, there's the unpredictability of it.

1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:11.700
 Even to like today, two practitioners

1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:14.680
 at vastly different levels of knowledge and experience

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:16.720
 in movement practice, there's information,

1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:19.680
 I like to think, to be gained from both sides.

1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:24.680
 So one thing that I've heard you say before,

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:27.960
 which really resonated with me is this idea

1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:31.100
 that people have, maybe in particular in the US,

1:22:31.100 --> 1:22:35.060
 have this concept of, oh, I have my yoga friends

1:22:35.060 --> 1:22:37.200
 or the people I dance with are distinct

1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:39.760
 from my family friends, are distinct from,

1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:43.880
 but as you pointed out, gathering around movement

1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:48.160
 is an age-old tradition, and that perhaps

1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:50.200
 we'd be better off not thinking about people

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:52.200
 we exercise with or train with,

1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:56.860
 but that friendship and connection made through movement

1:22:56.860 --> 1:23:00.720
 is perhaps the most valuable form of connection.

1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:03.520
 Yeah, I think it's a product of those practices

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:08.520
 that are maybe not so aware or not so movement-oriented

1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:13.360
 in the open sense, and then you get this sensation

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:16.000
 with people, but alone we do nothing.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:20.160
 So much so that we're never alone, also on the inside,

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.160
 and we will manufacture and produce entities inside.

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:30.280
 So we're constantly in a dynamic exchange,

1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:33.520
 cultural exchange, and practically,

1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:35.600
 I learned this lesson in Capoeira.

1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:39.600
 It's a cultural manifestation.

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:43.960
 Things happen within this context.

1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:45.940
 We rub against reality.

1:23:45.940 --> 1:23:50.940
 We rub against each other, and their movement occurs,

1:23:51.980 --> 1:23:56.980
 and their insight is to be gained, and development happens.

1:23:56.980 --> 1:24:01.980
 And then comes other thoughts, collective knowledge

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:05.920
 versus self-knowledge.

1:24:06.860 --> 1:24:08.800
 We are transmitting knowledge.

1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:12.720
 If we go on top of some mountain, 20 people,

1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:17.720
 20 normal individuals, and we spend 20 years

1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:23.960
 just fighting, four hours in the morning,

1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:25.540
 four hours in the afternoon.

1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:30.540
 We do it for 20 years, but we're isolated

1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:32.380
 from any other source of knowledge.

1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:34.980
 We would still not reach anything

1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:39.980
 that a very young fighter these days has.

1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:44.780
 We will be unable to develop those techniques,

1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:45.980
 those insights.

1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:47.660
 That's where collective knowledge comes in,

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:51.220
 and transmission jumps us forward.

1:24:51.220 --> 1:24:53.540
 But what is the problem with that?

1:24:53.540 --> 1:24:56.700
 Staying within just those technical constraints,

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:58.240
 and never making it yours.

1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.880
 That's the part of self-knowledge.

1:25:01.900 --> 1:25:05.580
 The digestion of this collective information

1:25:05.580 --> 1:25:09.540
 until it becomes digested and becomes part of yourselves,

1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:14.140
 and then you are it versus you are doing it.

1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:17.420
 And this is a clear separation that you can see in sports

1:25:17.420 --> 1:25:21.100
 on a very high level and on a not so high level.

1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:24.620
 Even though I would be honest if I say

1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:27.420
 that some people reach very far

1:25:27.420 --> 1:25:28.880
 just with collective knowledge

1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:31.260
 and a very technical approach,

1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:36.260
 and others reach extremely far with very little of it.

1:25:36.340 --> 1:25:38.420
 And there is always outliers.

1:25:38.420 --> 1:25:41.020
 There are always outliers in that case.

1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:45.020
 Another thought I had when you mentioned evo-devo.

1:25:45.900 --> 1:25:49.580
 Evolution, development is also the Greek concepts

1:25:49.580 --> 1:25:53.860
 of poiesis and pisis.

1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:58.760
 The growing of the seed into the tree,

1:26:01.020 --> 1:26:03.580
 and the other process of the manufacturing

1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:06.100
 of the chair from the tree.

1:26:07.860 --> 1:26:12.860
 Two processes of development, evolution, very different.

1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:15.820
 One from everything to something,

1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:18.220
 the other from nothing to something.

1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:22.060
 One is accumulation-based, one is subtraction-based.

1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:26.220
 Both of these processes relate to collective knowledge,

1:26:26.220 --> 1:26:29.620
 self-knowledge, but they're not exactly just that.

1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:31.500
 And what should we do?

1:26:31.500 --> 1:26:34.220
 This is a question that my friend Rasmus,

1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:38.260
 he asks in his thesis and thoughts.

1:26:38.260 --> 1:26:40.620
 What is the ultimate for us?

1:26:40.620 --> 1:26:43.500
 Should we manufacture our chair

1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:46.900
 or should we grow into the tree?

1:26:46.900 --> 1:26:49.860
 Civilize the mind, live savage the body.

1:26:49.860 --> 1:26:51.140
 Is it in this way?

1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:55.280
 Or should the mind also be left wild?

1:26:58.140 --> 1:27:01.940
 Wild and wise is a nice combination of words

1:27:01.940 --> 1:27:05.140
 that I like to place together, wild-wise.

1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:08.540
 So, this is something that I try to bring

1:27:08.540 --> 1:27:10.940
 into the way that I live my life and my practice.

1:27:10.940 --> 1:27:15.940
 And I try to bring the information and the wisdom

1:27:15.940 --> 1:27:20.520
 and the collective knowledge,

1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:24.100
 but I also try to let go of more and more

1:27:24.100 --> 1:27:28.400
 until an essence is gleaned, until something is appearing

1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:31.040
 and because everything was already there.

1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:34.300
 For example, if I'm sitting here,

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:40.620
 all the movements are already occurring.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:44.880
 All the possibilities are...

1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:48.680
 So, it's just about, I open this window,

1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:49.840
 the air would come from here.

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:51.560
 If I open this window, the air would come.

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:53.540
 I don't need to drive my motion.

1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:56.480
 I need to discover what is stopping it from happening.

1:27:57.600 --> 1:28:01.640
 Something is constantly holding and when we remove this,

1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:03.160
 immediately movement appears.

1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:08.160
 This is real deep movement versus the driven movement

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:11.360
 that is very wasteful at times, like walking.

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:13.240
 You see people pushing through the walk.

1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.000
 Instead of the controlled falling that it should be,

1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:23.320
 fighting, punching, to manufacture the strength

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.840
 and then to have someone who knows how to facilitate

1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:32.440
 the conditions in which you are knocked out.

1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:34.160
 It doesn't knock you out.

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:38.200
 It hits versus I hit, like Bruce Lee said.

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.960
 So, this is a beautiful thing to examine

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:42.320
 and to work within that.

1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:46.480
 So, to see, am I skateboarding?

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:51.480
 Am I using this perspective or am I trying to control

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:54.640
 because of risk and danger, I'm trying to overly control

1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:57.180
 something that actually can never be controlled.

1:28:57.180 --> 1:29:00.220
 The way to control it is to let go of the control

1:29:00.220 --> 1:29:03.800
 and then, okay, but what about all this collection

1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.080
 of information, knowledge that I can bring in?

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:08.840
 Where do I wanna play?

1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:11.960
 I can play down here or I can play up here.

1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:15.000
 The collective knowledge is maybe take you further in

1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:18.040
 and then you're still gonna need to do your individual work.

1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:20.080
 A lot of people like to romanticize on that

1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:24.260
 and you don't need teachers, we don't need nothing,

1:29:24.260 --> 1:29:25.840
 we don't need information.

1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:27.320
 It's not fully honest.

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:31.080
 You don't need, but depends on where you wanna function

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:32.360
 and how you wanna function.

1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:33.800
 They shouldn't be demonized,

1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:37.000
 but they shouldn't be overly glorified as well.

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.560
 You mentioned about the opportunity for movement,

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.040
 perhaps even all forms of movement

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:42.560
 coming from deep within.

1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:46.780
 It raises to mind in the neuroscience of motor systems,

1:29:46.780 --> 1:29:49.040
 we talk about motor neurons, as I described,

1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:52.680
 the ones that actually evoke contraction of muscles.

1:29:52.680 --> 1:29:55.000
 And then there's this category of neurons

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:58.080
 that isn't often discussed, but certainly exist,

1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:01.600
 aren't often discussed in kind of popular nomenclature

1:30:01.600 --> 1:30:04.460
 of neuroscience, which is the premotor system.

1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:07.320
 Most of our movements are the reflection

1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:11.960
 of certain patterns of transmission breaking through

1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:14.840
 from the premotor to the actual motor.

1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:16.860
 In other words, we are always

1:30:16.860 --> 1:30:20.920
 in a anticipatory mode of movement.

1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:23.560
 And I think you, the way you describe it,

1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:25.360
 you clearly intuitively understand this,

1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:27.760
 you feel it and you recognize it.

1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:30.100
 Think of it as it's like a layer of neurons

1:30:30.100 --> 1:30:33.360
 that's constantly humming, ready to go.

1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:35.020
 And it's the release of these gates

1:30:35.020 --> 1:30:37.760
 that allows movement to occur in a particular way,

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:40.320
 could be very smooth, could be very ballistic.

1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:44.000
 Which is DNA, the same, turning off and on,

1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:47.000
 but all the information is already there.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.460
 And then the possibilities are just allowed.

1:30:49.460 --> 1:30:54.460
 So I'm allowed, I don't do free will already,

1:30:55.440 --> 1:30:58.760
 but I am allowed to do.

1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:01.600
 I am, there are possibilities

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:06.600
 and I am dancing within that dance,

1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:09.400
 but I am not the only dancer.

1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:14.280
 So that's my sensation, at least with most

1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:20.160
 states of being, let's say.

1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:25.160
 Maybe there is other states that could be reached,

1:31:25.620 --> 1:31:28.960
 a stability that will arrive from the waters,

1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:31.120
 from the movement of the waters.

1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:35.640
 This humming, these potential possibilities,

1:31:35.640 --> 1:31:38.760
 to be in that state, to vibrate like this

1:31:38.760 --> 1:31:41.360
 is very powerful for our lives.

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:45.160
 To wake up in the morning and feel that living thing

1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:46.560
 is the feeling of movement,

1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:48.960
 and for me it's a result of the practice.

1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:53.040
 And so then it's easy not to stagnate

1:31:53.040 --> 1:31:55.400
 and then the mind can stay focused for hours

1:31:55.400 --> 1:31:59.480
 like we've done today and I can listen and tune in

1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:02.000
 and I won't lose you, which is very difficult.

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:05.520
 Like I haven't had a good conversation here in the US.

1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:08.240
 It's very difficult and I've had your attention

1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:10.280
 and you're listening, but it's rare.

1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:11.840
 It's rare that somebody can do that

1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:14.560
 and it's a struggle, always a struggle,

1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:18.440
 but it's definitely my trick, my dirty trick.

1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:21.000
 In the, you said you're allowed.

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:22.960
 And again, when I'm taking some of the language

1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:25.280
 and what you report about your experience

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:27.920
 and I'm trying to map it to some concepts

1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:29.600
 that relate to neural circuits,

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:32.480
 in the principles of neuroscience,

1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:36.760
 we talk about instructiveness versus permissiveness.

1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.880
 There are instructive cues, like for instance,

1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:41.120
 the ability to pick up this pen, right?

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:44.960
 There's an instruction, clearly there's a motor command,

1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:46.760
 but that's just one way of looking at it.

1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:49.720
 The way it actually works is that there's a pre-motor system

1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:51.760
 that's already generating that movement.

1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:53.680
 And what we've done is we flung open the gate

1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:56.040
 and allowed that movement to occur precisely.

1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:00.160
 Surfing it, surfing that current or this current

1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:02.560
 or another current or opening the window.

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:03.560
 Exactly.

1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:08.560
 And if you look at the formal study of movement

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:10.880
 and improvement of movement,

1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:13.880
 the most basic example I can give is like a tennis serve.

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:16.880
 And they, if you just, they've done this many times over,

1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:19.280
 you map the trajectories and in a novice,

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:21.000
 the lines are all over the place.

1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:25.900
 It ends up looking more like a tangle of rubber band ball.

1:33:25.900 --> 1:33:28.880
 Whereas in the Federer or the expert,

1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:31.600
 you almost wonder if it's just one line being drawn,

1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:35.000
 but it's the trajectories are incredibly stereotyped.

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:37.480
 That's the reflection of one little narrow gate opening

1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:39.800
 again and again and again, of course.

1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:42.160
 Let me, let me inject something here

1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:47.160
 from an old neurologist, you can say Berenstain,

1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:51.560
 the Soviet, and he talked about degrees of freedom.

1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:54.600
 And they did, in order to increase productivity

1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:59.200
 in Soviet Union, I don't know if you've heard this story,

1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:03.600
 he was brought in to examine the movement habits

1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:08.600
 of the workers and he collected some information.

1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:12.520
 He placed, he was one of the first kinetic,

1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:14.380
 I don't know how it's called in English,

1:34:14.380 --> 1:34:17.620
 the kinetic capturing of motion

1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:20.360
 with moving pictures in that time.

1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:24.440
 And so he placed these thoughts and they took these photos

1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:26.720
 which became kind of moving.

1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:30.200
 And what he discovered was something very interesting.

1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:34.180
 The accuracy of the hit of the sledgehammer

1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:40.920
 increased while the variance in the various points

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:43.920
 became more, not less.

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:47.520
 So it wasn't a fixed pattern, it was a meta pattern.

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:52.560
 And this pattern is adjusted in this way

1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:55.860
 to achieve the perfect execution.

1:34:55.860 --> 1:34:57.400
 Those were very early findings.

1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:00.740
 I'm not sure how does that sit with everything,

1:35:00.740 --> 1:35:04.300
 but I'm sure there is some truth to it from my experience.

1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:09.320
 Basically, the self-adjusting dynamic nature of the system

1:35:09.320 --> 1:35:14.320
 allows you to reach a very constant and stable end result

1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:19.480
 by being so open and letting go of your control.

1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:22.940
 The example you give fits very well

1:35:22.940 --> 1:35:24.700
 with the one that I described before

1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:26.560
 because I'm recalling the experiment.

1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:28.220
 If people want to look this up, it's a paper,

1:35:28.220 --> 1:35:29.860
 we'll put it in the show note caption.

1:35:29.860 --> 1:35:32.140
 The guy also happens to be at Harvard

1:35:32.140 --> 1:35:34.360
 named Benza Oliveski, a Hungarian,

1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:36.940
 I'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong, but I know Benza.

1:35:36.940 --> 1:35:39.860
 And I remember the slide in my mind's eye

1:35:39.860 --> 1:35:41.180
 and the trajectory that was mapped

1:35:41.180 --> 1:35:42.620
 was the movement of the tennis racket,

1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:45.620
 not of the limbs themselves in the Federer case.

1:35:45.620 --> 1:35:48.660
 So that I think aligns well with what you're describing.

1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:51.260
 Yeah, that exploration of degrees of freedom

1:35:51.260 --> 1:35:56.260
 is where the opportunity for real advancement

1:35:56.620 --> 1:35:58.580
 and expansion of skill shows up.

1:35:58.580 --> 1:35:59.900
 I think the way it's been described to me

1:35:59.900 --> 1:36:03.300
 is that we go from unskilled to skilled,

1:36:03.300 --> 1:36:05.720
 and then there's mastery, and then there's this top tier,

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:07.940
 which is this beautiful thin layer

1:36:07.940 --> 1:36:10.660
 that so few people occupy, which is virtuosity,

1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:13.860
 in which the practitioner invites variability

1:36:13.860 --> 1:36:18.860
 and chance back in as an opportunity to do truly new things.

1:36:22.180 --> 1:36:23.980
 It made me think many years ago,

1:36:23.980 --> 1:36:28.340
 this kind of thinking about, so what is that entity?

1:36:28.340 --> 1:36:30.660
 Because obviously it's not technique.

1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.340
 And it wouldn't even be honest to say

1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:34.340
 it's a movement pattern.

1:36:34.340 --> 1:36:37.100
 There is too much diversity there.

1:36:37.100 --> 1:36:40.300
 I started to talk about, I called it movement sleeves

1:36:40.300 --> 1:36:42.100
 or meta technique.

1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:46.280
 But the word technique is already misleading.

1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:51.420
 So there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve

1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:53.700
 in which you can move.

1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:56.060
 As long as you're not out of this sleeve,

1:36:56.060 --> 1:36:58.220
 you're still within the boundaries

1:36:58.220 --> 1:37:01.740
 of achieving the result that you're after.

1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:04.500
 And then there is all this adaptation

1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:07.740
 of all these elements inside to keep you in the sleeve.

1:37:07.740 --> 1:37:11.320
 The sleeve is not constricted as we once thought.

1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:13.320
 Oh, beautiful technique.

1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:15.660
 There are many ways to skin a cat.

1:37:17.020 --> 1:37:20.060
 And that experience and that variety,

1:37:20.060 --> 1:37:23.420
 that diversity goes into virtuosity.

1:37:23.420 --> 1:37:27.620
 It's true freedom because your focus is on the right thing.

1:37:27.620 --> 1:37:30.460
 You don't point at the moon, look at your finger.

1:37:30.460 --> 1:37:35.140
 And that's really in essence being a virtuoso for me,

1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:39.060
 like mastery, let's say, if there is such a thing.

1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:43.080
 Oh, I do believe there is such a thing and I'll flatter

1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:44.500
 and attempt to embarrass you by saying,

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.040
 I think that I'm not alone in viewing you

1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:47.620
 as a virtuoso movement.

1:37:47.620 --> 1:37:50.260
 I think that's what comes to mind

1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:51.620
 because there's this notion

1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:54.420
 that not everything is pre-planned,

1:37:54.420 --> 1:37:57.360
 that even you might not know what you're going to do next

1:37:57.360 --> 1:37:59.020
 until the moment of execution.

1:37:59.020 --> 1:38:02.540
 But that here I'm projecting my own assumptions.

1:38:02.540 --> 1:38:07.540
 I'd like to talk about mindsets

1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:10.920
 in approaching practice a little bit more,

1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:13.700
 but I want to wade into that territory

1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:16.780
 by talking about vision in the eyes,

1:38:16.780 --> 1:38:19.300
 something that we both share a deep interest in.

1:38:19.300 --> 1:38:21.520
 I, from the background of visual neuroscience,

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:22.900
 but also from the realization

1:38:22.900 --> 1:38:25.480
 that we have this incredible ability

1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:27.660
 to adjust the aperture of our visual window.

1:38:27.660 --> 1:38:31.400
 We can focus very narrowly and we can focus very broadly.

1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:32.740
 This was something I encountered, I think,

1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:33.580
 first as a child,

1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:36.940
 realizing that I could spend all day watching ants play

1:38:36.940 --> 1:38:39.900
 in a very fine domain and then look up and go inside

1:38:39.900 --> 1:38:42.620
 and realize there's a whole world and realizing,

1:38:42.620 --> 1:38:45.940
 wow, I'll never be able to consume the full range

1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:48.580
 of experiences at any one moment.

1:38:48.580 --> 1:38:50.740
 There are ants probably in the corner of this room

1:38:50.740 --> 1:38:51.700
 doing their thing.

1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:56.220
 And so too, our approach to movement can be,

1:38:56.220 --> 1:38:58.100
 as you mentioned, very big and dynamic

1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:00.420
 in terms of the broad movements of our limbs

1:39:00.420 --> 1:39:02.260
 or fine articulation.

1:39:02.260 --> 1:39:04.560
 When you begin a practice or,

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.620
 and as you move through a practice,

1:39:06.620 --> 1:39:11.620
 do you apply a regimented way of focusing your vision?

1:39:12.860 --> 1:39:14.380
 Are you in panoramic vision?

1:39:14.380 --> 1:39:16.700
 Are you in a very narrow field of view

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:18.500
 or does it entirely depend?

1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:20.580
 And for the person who's a true beginner,

1:39:20.580 --> 1:39:22.500
 true novice like myself,

1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:25.820
 how should I show up to the practice with my eyes?

1:39:25.820 --> 1:39:29.860
 Yeah, the eyes are a good starting point

1:39:29.860 --> 1:39:33.580
 as you help a lot of people to understand.

1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:37.300
 And when you encounter difficulties with other layers,

1:39:37.300 --> 1:39:39.940
 it's very powerful to start with the eyes.

1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:44.120
 Another thing important to understand and to experience,

1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.120
 you can't believe me or you gotta examine it for yourself,

1:39:49.620 --> 1:39:54.460
 we do not move the eyes as well as we think we do.

1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:57.660
 Because as long as you can see and move the eyes,

1:39:57.660 --> 1:40:00.140
 people never think about it,

1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:03.360
 that it can be trained, that it can be improved, et cetera.

1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:06.320
 And the effects of it are far reaching.

1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:09.980
 The eyes lead to the inner eye.

1:40:09.980 --> 1:40:13.020
 You can think of it in a beautiful metaphorical way.

1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:18.580
 And it's a representation of the way

1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:23.580
 that we use various cognitive and mind processes.

1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:25.880
 And also of course affect the body.

1:40:26.860 --> 1:40:31.860
 The eyes lead in many ways and the head is also a very,

1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:36.480
 because all of these inputs are coming in here.

1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:38.960
 So it's very easy to lead the body

1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:41.540
 if you look at the centered weight from the head.

1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:43.500
 It's a very powerful and easy thing.

1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:47.900
 For example, when you teach boxers how to bob,

1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:50.580
 usually it's not done in the way

1:40:50.580 --> 1:40:53.880
 that I believe it should be done.

1:40:53.880 --> 1:40:56.320
 You teach it with the periphery.

1:40:56.320 --> 1:40:58.540
 They teach it from the feet.

1:40:58.540 --> 1:41:00.540
 Because they have the idea, which is correct,

1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:04.420
 that you need to do it in spatial conditions,

1:41:04.420 --> 1:41:07.260
 in movement, in space.

1:41:07.260 --> 1:41:10.060
 But in reality, the head will organize the feet for you.

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:14.060
 Instead, you are now putting two elements together

1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:15.600
 and then with years of practice,

1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:18.100
 you hope of tying them together well.

1:41:18.100 --> 1:41:19.440
 I prefer to do something else

1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:21.740
 because if I'll pull your head now to the side,

1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:25.940
 you will immediately start to organize your feet under you.

1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:28.860
 So I give you just one element to manipulate the system from.

1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:32.120
 That's how I would teach someone something like this.

1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:34.280
 Many animals hunt with the head.

1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:36.400
 So you can see the body running forward

1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:38.180
 while the head is turning to the side.

1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:40.260
 The whole thing follows afterwards.

1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:42.420
 So it's a very powerful way to address movement.

1:41:42.420 --> 1:41:43.460
 Not the only one.

1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:45.980
 There are many modes, thankfully,

1:41:45.980 --> 1:41:47.620
 and we're very adaptable in that,

1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:50.260
 but definitely a primary one.

1:41:50.260 --> 1:41:52.580
 And then the use of the eyes is, of course,

1:41:52.580 --> 1:41:55.960
 maybe the most important element with that, usually.

1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:02.020
 Yeah, what else can I say about the eyes?

1:42:02.020 --> 1:42:03.020
 How do you come in?

1:42:03.020 --> 1:42:04.540
 Well, it depends on the practice.

1:42:04.540 --> 1:42:08.420
 You need to start to have some kind of a checklist

1:42:08.420 --> 1:42:11.260
 of what you're looking to do.

1:42:11.260 --> 1:42:13.580
 And then by this, you can start to tailor

1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:15.900
 the way that you use your eyes.

1:42:15.900 --> 1:42:18.300
 The same thing I do for posture,

1:42:18.300 --> 1:42:20.140
 the same thing I do for stance,

1:42:20.140 --> 1:42:22.580
 the same thing, eventually, I do for state.

1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:25.060
 And there is different flavors.

1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:26.860
 There is no correct way to use the eyes.

1:42:26.860 --> 1:42:28.540
 Sometimes it's very peripheral,

1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.860
 soft, open, awareness orientation.

1:42:31.860 --> 1:42:33.720
 Sometimes it's very focused.

1:42:34.620 --> 1:42:38.340
 Notice that I'm pulling these two opposites,

1:42:38.340 --> 1:42:39.860
 awareness and focus,

1:42:39.860 --> 1:42:42.700
 which is often put together and confused.

1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:47.700
 And then the eyes are the immediate

1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:51.300
 and the easiest entry point into that.

1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:54.700
 Another thing is the placement of the head and the eyes.

1:42:55.900 --> 1:42:59.100
 Like, for example, when we lower our chin,

1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:01.560
 we seem to see better.

1:43:02.500 --> 1:43:04.840
 When we raise the eyebrows,

1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:08.280
 there is too much exposure of top light sources.

1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:09.860
 And so people would usually,

1:43:09.860 --> 1:43:11.140
 when looking into the distance,

1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:13.340
 will tilt their chin in.

1:43:13.340 --> 1:43:17.120
 And in many scenarios, tilting of the chin to the side

1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:20.800
 or placing, just like listening with the ear,

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:23.700
 placing a certain eye or dominant eye,

1:43:23.700 --> 1:43:26.460
 depending on various scenarios.

1:43:26.460 --> 1:43:31.160
 And this is all information that I can come in cerebrally

1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:34.680
 and think about and jump my practice forward.

1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.480
 Instead of just letting the experience teach me that,

1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:40.480
 I'm using some kind of a thinking process

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:43.100
 to improve and this is not cheating.

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:44.380
 This is great.

1:43:44.380 --> 1:43:45.420
 Will it work?

1:43:45.420 --> 1:43:46.580
 We got to try.

1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:48.880
 It's a process.

1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:51.580
 Those are some thoughts to start to play with.

1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:52.620
 Yeah.

1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:56.040
 I love that you mentioned chin down

1:43:56.040 --> 1:43:57.720
 because we all have a natural reflex.

1:43:57.720 --> 1:43:59.380
 When chin goes down, eyes goes up.

1:43:59.380 --> 1:44:03.260
 And the opposite is true when head goes up, eyes go down.

1:44:03.260 --> 1:44:05.540
 And there are two separate clusters of neurons

1:44:05.540 --> 1:44:09.260
 in these cranial nerve nuclei that, as we call them,

1:44:09.260 --> 1:44:13.520
 when eyes are up, it increases our level

1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:14.960
 of alertness overall.

1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:18.000
 This is not, you know, this is not woo science.

1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:22.060
 This is the function of these cranial nerve nuclei.

1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:25.580
 When our eyes are down, we go into states

1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:27.260
 of more calm and quiescence.

1:44:27.260 --> 1:44:28.340
 And this makes perfect sense.

1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:29.960
 You know, and then the eyelids usually go down

1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:31.540
 and then people fall asleep.

1:44:31.540 --> 1:44:33.660
 Eyes up does not mean head up,

1:44:33.660 --> 1:44:35.820
 because as you said, there's a very dynamic control

1:44:35.820 --> 1:44:38.380
 over the amount of luminance, depending on the environment.

1:44:38.380 --> 1:44:41.300
 So that, and then as you mentioned,

1:44:41.300 --> 1:44:43.840
 this difference between focus and awareness,

1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:46.140
 I think is a really important one.

1:44:46.140 --> 1:44:48.860
 When we are in this more panoramic soft gaze

1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:53.820
 and broad awareness, big swaths of visual field, as we say,

1:44:53.820 --> 1:44:56.220
 the neurons that control that come through a pathway

1:44:56.220 --> 1:44:57.420
 called magnocellular pathway.

1:44:57.420 --> 1:44:59.460
 In any event, those neurons are much thicker,

1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:00.300
 thicker cables.

1:45:00.300 --> 1:45:03.100
 They transmit much faster, just like thick pipes

1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:05.560
 can carry more water more quickly.

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:09.260
 And your reaction time is at least four times

1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:11.740
 what it is in this awareness mode

1:45:11.740 --> 1:45:14.080
 than it is when you're narrowly focused on something.

1:45:14.080 --> 1:45:16.440
 And this is counterintuitive, I think, to a lot of people.

1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:18.240
 But the person who is running to catch the ball

1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:21.620
 is not tracking the ball in a smooth movement.

1:45:21.620 --> 1:45:23.500
 Most of their vision is in peripheral vision.

1:45:23.500 --> 1:45:25.700
 When we drive, we're in this peripheral vision

1:45:25.700 --> 1:45:28.500
 and our reaction times are much, much faster.

1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:32.660
 So I don't know if, I'm reluctant to encourage people

1:45:32.660 --> 1:45:34.940
 to shift toward a particular type of practice

1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:36.120
 or to a particular type of vision.

1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:40.280
 I think what you and I, I hope, agree on,

1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:41.120
 correct me if I'm wrong,

1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:44.560
 is that exploring these different extremes

1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:46.920
 and everything in between is where the real value is.

1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.180
 Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down,

1:45:51.180 --> 1:45:54.140
 head down, eyes up, playing with it and exploring it

1:45:55.460 --> 1:45:58.820
 as opposed to, for the first 10 minutes of practice,

1:45:58.820 --> 1:46:00.020
 being panoramic vision.

1:46:00.020 --> 1:46:03.020
 You know, the sort of, earlier today we were joking about

1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:05.380
 and kind of lamenting the fact

1:46:05.380 --> 1:46:07.420
 that this word biohacking exists

1:46:07.420 --> 1:46:09.800
 or that the optimal performance.

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:12.260
 They're unfortunate terms because they suggest

1:46:12.260 --> 1:46:13.500
 that if you just plug it in,

1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:15.100
 it's going to be like two plus two equals four

1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:17.580
 and you're going to get it right every time.

1:46:17.580 --> 1:46:20.660
 Another pragmatic bit here, if I can offer, is

1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:27.180
 since our culture has been more geared

1:46:27.180 --> 1:46:28.940
 in pushing us towards focus,

1:46:28.940 --> 1:46:32.020
 the focus use of the eyes and primary language reading

1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:36.540
 and other things, we have less opportunities

1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:39.580
 to work with the more open panoramic one.

1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:42.180
 So, it would be smart to start

1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:45.540
 to balance things out a bit more.

1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:48.760
 When you're in nature, you don't look at each leaf.

1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:52.260
 Everything is moving and you are kind of immersed in that

1:46:52.260 --> 1:46:53.960
 and then something attracts your attention.

1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.740
 Oh, it's a bird and you focus

1:46:55.740 --> 1:46:59.140
 and you go back into the general state,

1:46:59.140 --> 1:47:02.780
 the basic state, which is open awareness.

1:47:02.780 --> 1:47:05.820
 Here, we switch things around in our modern culture.

1:47:05.820 --> 1:47:10.100
 We are mostly focused and then we sanitize daydream,

1:47:10.100 --> 1:47:12.580
 which is maybe some kind of a,

1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:17.540
 some kind of a balancing act that comes from deep within.

1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:20.860
 I don't know, maybe you can share some information

1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:24.440
 about that, but I see that many times people need to,

1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:29.440
 the focus is overly done by far in our lives.

1:47:29.460 --> 1:47:30.780
 I couldn't agree more.

1:47:30.780 --> 1:47:33.340
 And I think a lot of, I'll even venture so far as to say

1:47:33.340 --> 1:47:36.420
 that a lot of the visual deficits

1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:38.340
 that we now see in young people,

1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:41.360
 myopia, literally nearsightedness occurs

1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:43.540
 because if we look at things that are too close to us,

1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:46.800
 as children or as adults, the eyeball actually gets longer.

1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:50.780
 The lens focuses the visual image in front

1:47:50.780 --> 1:47:53.240
 of nearer to the lens, nearsighted,

1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:56.720
 then in front of where it should land.

1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:01.140
 And basically it's a lack of panoramic vision

1:48:01.140 --> 1:48:04.540
 that is, or open awareness that's driving these changes.

1:48:04.540 --> 1:48:06.820
 And nowadays we are essentially,

1:48:06.820 --> 1:48:11.140
 most people are 90% of the time in this narrow focus mode.

1:48:11.140 --> 1:48:12.900
 Right before recording, we took a break

1:48:12.900 --> 1:48:14.340
 and went up to look at a vista

1:48:14.340 --> 1:48:15.620
 and to look off to the distance.

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:19.700
 Incredibly useful, easy practice at some level,

1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:22.220
 but I think most people are not doing this sort of thing.

1:48:22.220 --> 1:48:23.940
 And the way that it shapes the mind

1:48:23.940 --> 1:48:25.540
 and the perception of time, of course,

1:48:25.540 --> 1:48:28.320
 is a whole other kingdom of ideas.

1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:32.720
 But one thing I'd like to relate this element of vision to

1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:34.820
 and open awareness is earlier you mentioned

1:48:34.820 --> 1:48:36.500
 the cone of auditory attention,

1:48:36.500 --> 1:48:38.860
 the other sense that we can play with

1:48:38.860 --> 1:48:42.380
 in as in our practice and throughout the day.

1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:47.560
 Do you see any value to both paying attention to things

1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:49.580
 in a very narrow cone of auditory attention,

1:48:49.580 --> 1:48:52.840
 but also just walking and listening to all the sounds

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:53.680
 at once?

1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:55.340
 I could imagine that could be useful.

1:48:55.340 --> 1:48:58.620
 And in terms of physical movement practices,

1:48:58.620 --> 1:49:00.260
 I was going to say, where are your ears?

1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:02.060
 Your ears are always more or less in the same place,

1:49:02.060 --> 1:49:05.400
 but where is your hearing when you approach your practice?

1:49:06.620 --> 1:49:09.600
 Another set of parameters to think about

1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:11.840
 and to play with and to be aware of.

1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:17.380
 Also, I have the experience that some people are

1:49:17.380 --> 1:49:22.380
 better at using this system or that system.

1:49:22.500 --> 1:49:26.160
 And you would be amazed how differently

1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:28.980
 the same results, seemingly outside results,

1:49:28.980 --> 1:49:30.920
 are done by different practitioners

1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:32.280
 and in different scenarios.

1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:38.420
 This goes into this mutation and change ideas.

1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:40.860
 What really jumps us forward eventually

1:49:40.860 --> 1:49:42.740
 is some kind of a mutation.

1:49:42.740 --> 1:49:47.320
 So it's like all of our culture and practices and success

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:50.160
 puts us closer and closer to each other.

1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:54.420
 So we have the same opinions everywhere around the world

1:49:54.420 --> 1:49:58.660
 becoming more and more the same, less and less different.

1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:02.480
 But the real hope comes from the different.

1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:07.480
 So we have a difficulty in promoting that.

1:50:10.140 --> 1:50:13.380
 So this is another thing that can be promoted

1:50:13.380 --> 1:50:16.460
 with the right practices, the right,

1:50:16.460 --> 1:50:19.300
 for example, I work with corporates

1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:22.120
 or even worked with governments before

1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:24.060
 to bring in some of that freshness

1:50:24.060 --> 1:50:26.600
 with simple habits in the workday

1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:31.600
 or in the education of children or in companies,

1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:34.740
 increasing productivity.

1:50:34.740 --> 1:50:36.700
 I don't really give a fuck,

1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:41.320
 but I am there to give what I view is important.

1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:45.140
 And what is important maybe increases productivity,

1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:47.180
 but it's more important to me

1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:50.400
 that it improves people's lives who are involved

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:55.400
 and improves being and becoming,

1:50:56.060 --> 1:50:59.140
 being and becoming these two entities.

1:50:59.140 --> 1:51:02.860
 I'm not there, I'm on my way, I'm a process.

1:51:02.860 --> 1:51:06.700
 So thinking about hearing,

1:51:06.700 --> 1:51:09.020
 the way that people use their ears,

1:51:09.020 --> 1:51:10.900
 the way that people use listening.

1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:14.540
 Again, we can talk about placement of the head

1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:19.060
 and posture, sometimes angling as well,

1:51:19.060 --> 1:51:20.660
 sharper angle, chin down.

1:51:20.660 --> 1:51:24.780
 Some people tend to use the shape of the ear,

1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:28.820
 people with different ears closer or further out.

1:51:28.820 --> 1:51:31.460
 This is, if you're very sensitive

1:51:31.460 --> 1:51:32.340
 and you're looking around,

1:51:32.340 --> 1:51:37.220
 you would see this is affecting people's motion,

1:51:37.220 --> 1:51:39.340
 even the shape of our face,

1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:43.180
 like the development of the vocal cords and speaking

1:51:43.180 --> 1:51:46.280
 will totally change how we look,

1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:51.200
 but how we listen also will do the same.

1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:52.520
 I don't have any proof of it,

1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:56.540
 but it is something I believe in.

1:51:56.540 --> 1:51:59.140
 Well, people will even make their ears bigger, right?

1:51:59.140 --> 1:52:03.140
 We try and become like little fennec foxes or something.

1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:04.140
 I mean, a lot of people don't realize

1:52:04.140 --> 1:52:05.260
 that's actually why we do this,

1:52:05.260 --> 1:52:07.360
 is to capture more sound waves, right?

1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:10.040
 And the leaning is that the localization of sound

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:12.200
 is based on a simple brainstem calculation

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:14.340
 of interaural time differences,

1:52:14.340 --> 1:52:16.320
 the time in which something,

1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:19.060
 the brain intuitively, it just knows,

1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:20.860
 because it's a pretty hardwired circuit,

1:52:20.860 --> 1:52:23.440
 that if a sound arrives first to this ear, then that ear,

1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:26.500
 that it's likely coming from over here.

1:52:26.500 --> 1:52:28.140
 Whereas if it's dead center,

1:52:28.140 --> 1:52:30.620
 it arrives at the two at the same time.

1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:33.420
 It's almost ridiculously simple when one hears it,

1:52:33.420 --> 1:52:34.460
 no pun intended,

1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:39.460
 but it is an incredibly valuable way of thinking

1:52:39.460 --> 1:52:42.520
 about how the architecture of the body

1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:44.740
 changes our experience.

1:52:44.740 --> 1:52:46.220
 I went along those lines.

1:52:46.220 --> 1:52:47.340
 Earlier, you mentioned something

1:52:47.340 --> 1:52:50.420
 and it flagged an important question for me.

1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:55.020
 When I see people walking,

1:52:55.020 --> 1:52:57.080
 I sometimes, you know, sometimes I think, wow,

1:52:57.080 --> 1:52:59.280
 they really move in a strange way.

1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:01.700
 Occasionally, you see somebody, they walk really,

1:53:01.700 --> 1:53:04.220
 it's impressive for whatever reason, you know,

1:53:04.220 --> 1:53:07.500
 and you just think, wow, they sort of glide along.

1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:09.300
 People come in different shapes and sizes,

1:53:09.300 --> 1:53:11.680
 short torsos, long arms, et cetera.

1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:16.220
 Do you think that if people have a body type

1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:19.300
 that facilitates certain kinds of movement and not others,

1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:22.820
 that they should intentionally try and move in the way

1:53:22.820 --> 1:53:26.220
 that is right at the edge of the kind of friction

1:53:26.220 --> 1:53:31.220
 and challenge in order to shape new possibilities?

1:53:31.780 --> 1:53:33.120
 Or do you think that they should lean

1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:34.860
 into the smooth execution

1:53:34.860 --> 1:53:36.660
 of what comes most naturally to them?

1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:41.660
 Yeah, I think a good practice is to have many walks

1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:47.460
 because they're required.

1:53:47.460 --> 1:53:49.820
 Of course, there is a very efficient

1:53:49.820 --> 1:53:52.780
 and endurance stamina-oriented thing

1:53:52.780 --> 1:53:54.900
 that if you have the experience,

1:53:54.900 --> 1:53:57.560
 it will naturally develop and unravel.

1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:00.940
 And if not, you can get some collective knowledge

1:54:00.940 --> 1:54:01.900
 and improve.

1:54:01.900 --> 1:54:06.580
 And then there is a lot of emotional things,

1:54:06.580 --> 1:54:08.860
 related to walk, like how I'm walking

1:54:08.860 --> 1:54:10.380
 into a business meeting,

1:54:13.180 --> 1:54:18.020
 or how I'm walking out of a bad situation.

1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:24.220
 And there is a lot of beautiful things to research there,

1:54:24.220 --> 1:54:25.900
 practically with yourself,

1:54:25.900 --> 1:54:28.940
 trying to approach someone with the chin slightly down,

1:54:28.940 --> 1:54:32.060
 very linear, very efficient, in the straightest line,

1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:34.820
 or trying to approach someone a little bit more rounded

1:54:34.820 --> 1:54:36.060
 from the side.

1:54:36.060 --> 1:54:37.700
 And tilting your head,

1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:40.540
 and you will see totally different results,

1:54:40.540 --> 1:54:42.140
 totally different communication

1:54:42.140 --> 1:54:45.100
 that happens over people's heads.

1:54:45.100 --> 1:54:47.300
 But if you're sensitive, you realize that,

1:54:47.300 --> 1:54:49.200
 wow, this opened the door.

1:54:50.220 --> 1:54:52.140
 Many people, you start on the minus.

1:54:52.140 --> 1:54:54.540
 My sister, my big sister, Tali, she always says,

1:54:54.540 --> 1:54:56.540
 I started on the minus.

1:54:56.540 --> 1:54:58.960
 Why don't I start on the zero with them?

1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:02.620
 But it's part of the approach.

1:55:02.620 --> 1:55:03.580
 You can affect that.

1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:05.440
 And you can start even on the plus,

1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:10.440
 if you are the sly man, as the practitioner needs to be.

1:55:10.620 --> 1:55:14.300
 So this is something to play with and to work with.

1:55:14.300 --> 1:55:17.080
 And then you have, of course, body proportions and ways.

1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:20.520
 And we have all these like technical invasions,

1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:23.580
 mathematics and trigonometry and architecture.

1:55:23.580 --> 1:55:25.080
 They invaded our bodies.

1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:27.260
 They invaded our nervous system.

1:55:27.260 --> 1:55:30.080
 And now our walk and our physical practices,

1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:32.680
 they look linear and efficient.

1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:34.780
 The path between two points is a straight line.

1:55:34.780 --> 1:55:36.580
 It's not, this is biomechanics.

1:55:36.580 --> 1:55:37.960
 It's not mechanics.

1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:41.420
 Nothing there is given.

1:55:41.420 --> 1:55:43.260
 There's no gospel.

1:55:43.260 --> 1:55:47.380
 So the walk is sometimes have to go around

1:55:47.380 --> 1:55:49.060
 or sway from side to side.

1:55:49.060 --> 1:55:51.680
 And there is coiling, uncoiling, and there are moving bits.

1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:54.580
 And what about the coordination of my breathing

1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:55.420
 with my walk?

1:55:55.420 --> 1:55:57.380
 Because if I walk too linearly,

1:55:57.380 --> 1:56:00.340
 there is less pumping of the air naturally in and out.

1:56:00.340 --> 1:56:03.300
 So now I have to forcefully bring it in and out.

1:56:03.300 --> 1:56:04.900
 I'm wasteful.

1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:07.760
 And that's why you see in last years,

1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:12.020
 these incredible runners, especially in long distance,

1:56:12.020 --> 1:56:16.380
 doing things we never thought were possible

1:56:16.380 --> 1:56:19.660
 in the most, in the worst possible way

1:56:19.660 --> 1:56:21.640
 that we used to think.

1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:24.060
 Pronation and all kinds of things.

1:56:24.060 --> 1:56:29.060
 Like our technical thoughts were totally misguided and wrong.

1:56:29.060 --> 1:56:34.060
 And then somebody comes in and does it in some way

1:56:36.100 --> 1:56:37.040
 that is totally wrong.

1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:40.580
 And he gets results we could never get.

1:56:40.580 --> 1:56:44.220
 That's the beauty of playfulness, experimentation,

1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:46.120
 change, being different.

1:56:48.140 --> 1:56:49.460
 As you're describing this, I'm smiling

1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:52.260
 because one of my favorite neuroscientists,

1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:55.960
 he's out of the University of Chicago, was in a meeting.

1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:58.220
 There was an argument about evolution of the nervous system.

1:56:58.220 --> 1:57:02.100
 And he said at the end, and people were arguing about

1:57:02.100 --> 1:57:04.660
 whether or not this gene in one animal was homologous

1:57:04.660 --> 1:57:07.920
 to this gene in humans, et cetera, it can get very dicey.

1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:10.820
 And he said, very appropriately,

1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:13.500
 that one of the major jobs of evolution

1:57:13.500 --> 1:57:16.140
 is to take existing cell types and circuits

1:57:16.140 --> 1:57:17.720
 and give them new functions.

1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:21.420
 But that can only be done through the playful exploration

1:57:21.420 --> 1:57:23.140
 of new possibilities.

1:57:23.140 --> 1:57:25.740
 Which I think maps very well to what you're saying.

1:57:25.740 --> 1:57:30.060
 That at the extreme thresholds of technical execution,

1:57:30.060 --> 1:57:32.240
 mastery, mastery, mastery,

1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:34.900
 your obviously performance is very high,

1:57:34.900 --> 1:57:37.700
 but the opportunity for evolution of the sport

1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:40.700
 or the music or the dance or the intellectual endeavor

1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:44.020
 is limited because you're not introducing variability.

1:57:44.020 --> 1:57:46.780
 In the attempt to get proper execution,

1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:48.980
 you're limiting oneself.

1:57:48.980 --> 1:57:53.100
 Hence, I want to offer something that is relating to you.

1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:58.100
 We should be wary of defining the mechanisms

1:58:03.500 --> 1:58:08.500
 and putting certain meaning with certain processes and ways

1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:11.500
 because just history and experience shows

1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:15.140
 it doesn't work well for us most times.

1:58:15.140 --> 1:58:18.560
 Or it becomes like this much more elaborate thing,

1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:22.500
 even if we were somewhat in the right direction.

1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:26.100
 Because even thinking this way can offer a lot.

1:58:26.100 --> 1:58:30.460
 Like for example, your advice about heat, dopamine, light,

1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:34.420
 offers a lot of benefit but also can create problems.

1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:38.380
 And it can enclose something

1:58:38.380 --> 1:58:43.380
 which the improviser will find, the MacGyvers, right?

1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:48.100
 Like take some paperclip

1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:51.100
 and you make it into something great.

1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:53.140
 And this is really our,

1:58:54.260 --> 1:58:56.340
 we are the biggest improvisers around.

1:58:56.340 --> 1:58:58.340
 Like that's what made us who we are.

1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:01.340
 I think this is incredible what we can do with it.

1:59:02.420 --> 1:59:07.420
 You know, the Russian-American space exploration story

1:59:07.420 --> 1:59:10.100
 with the space pen, famous story

1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:12.740
 about the development of the space pen.

1:59:12.740 --> 1:59:13.980
 No, the space pen?

1:59:13.980 --> 1:59:14.820
 Yeah.

1:59:14.820 --> 1:59:15.660
 No, I don't know about this.

1:59:15.660 --> 1:59:17.780
 I think it's an urban myth.

1:59:17.780 --> 1:59:21.100
 I don't know if it's true, but I like it, so I use it.

1:59:21.100 --> 1:59:25.660
 So there was this, of course, space competition

1:59:25.660 --> 1:59:29.540
 and the Russians put the first animal in space.

1:59:29.540 --> 1:59:30.380
 And the first-

1:59:30.380 --> 1:59:31.980
 I think it was a macaque monkey or something like that.

1:59:31.980 --> 1:59:32.820
 Yeah.

1:59:32.820 --> 1:59:37.660
 And then Leica and they put the first Sputnik,

1:59:37.660 --> 1:59:40.180
 the satellite and man in space,

1:59:40.180 --> 1:59:43.860
 but Americans took the man on the moon.

1:59:43.860 --> 1:59:46.540
 And on the way, a lot of technologies got developed

1:59:46.540 --> 1:59:49.140
 and the Americans, because of lack of gravity out there,

1:59:49.140 --> 1:59:51.860
 developed the space pen with a huge investment.

1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:53.340
 The Russians used the pencil.

1:59:56.540 --> 1:59:58.740
 So I don't know if it's true.

1:59:58.740 --> 1:59:59.580
 I don't think it is,

1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:02.460
 but it represents something in the state of mind.

2:00:02.460 --> 2:00:03.580
 Like you look at, for example,

2:00:03.580 --> 2:00:06.660
 the military equipment in Soviet equipment,

2:00:06.660 --> 2:00:09.540
 it all can do multiple things.

2:00:09.540 --> 2:00:12.580
 And it means that it's heavier, it's less efficient.

2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.100
 It's not as light.

2:00:14.100 --> 2:00:19.100
 But even the Navy SEALs will still carry an AK

2:00:19.260 --> 2:00:21.380
 with certain conditions.

2:00:21.380 --> 2:00:22.220
 Why?

2:00:22.220 --> 2:00:23.740
 Because you can pour a whole bucket of sand

2:00:23.740 --> 2:00:26.100
 into the mechanism and it will keep running.

2:00:26.100 --> 2:00:29.260
 While the most advanced German heckler and kuchen,

2:00:29.260 --> 2:00:31.700
 accurate and light weapons,

2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:35.140
 for every grain can get stuck and overly specialized.

2:00:35.140 --> 2:00:36.820
 And there is something about this openness

2:00:36.820 --> 2:00:39.380
 that we humans need to keep.

2:00:39.380 --> 2:00:42.340
 And also maybe something for our leaders

2:00:42.340 --> 2:00:45.980
 to be more of less specialist and more in this openness,

2:00:45.980 --> 2:00:48.740
 less capable in this or that way,

2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:51.080
 but more capable of doing the whole thing.

2:00:53.660 --> 2:00:55.020
 I love the story.

2:00:55.020 --> 2:00:57.260
 Whether or not it's a legend or not,

2:00:57.260 --> 2:01:00.460
 it's legendary because it's fantastic.

2:01:00.460 --> 2:01:01.540
 As you say, in the laboratory,

2:01:01.540 --> 2:01:03.360
 whenever someone takes on a project in my lab,

2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:05.580
 I always say, you have to ask yourself

2:01:05.580 --> 2:01:09.060
 how much technical detail and challenge you want to take on

2:01:09.060 --> 2:01:12.140
 because with more technology, advanced technology,

2:01:12.140 --> 2:01:13.940
 yes, there's the opportunity for more discovery,

2:01:13.940 --> 2:01:15.300
 but more downtime.

2:01:15.300 --> 2:01:17.540
 Your PhD will literally take longer

2:01:17.540 --> 2:01:18.820
 if you're going to use a microscope

2:01:18.820 --> 2:01:21.680
 that's out of commission 30% of the time.

2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:23.460
 And you just have to understand that.

2:01:23.460 --> 2:01:26.280
 So there's a dynamic interplay there.

2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:28.940
 By the way, I think that scientists get it right.

2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:30.820
 It's where you transmit the knowledge

2:01:30.820 --> 2:01:32.860
 out of the scientific field

2:01:32.860 --> 2:01:35.420
 because science have debate and everything.

2:01:35.420 --> 2:01:36.940
 You're not so connected.

2:01:36.940 --> 2:01:38.240
 Of course, this can happen as well,

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:43.240
 but then when it goes out and the simple person

2:01:43.300 --> 2:01:46.880
 without the experience takes it more as a gospel,

2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:50.100
 as a fixed thing, and then it was just a report.

2:01:50.100 --> 2:01:53.220
 It was just reporting some functions here and play with it.

2:01:53.220 --> 2:01:55.100
 See what it does for you.

2:01:55.100 --> 2:01:58.980
 Because with all the greatest information that I can give,

2:01:58.980 --> 2:02:00.420
 the person will examine it

2:02:00.420 --> 2:02:03.980
 and it might be not useful at all for him.

2:02:03.980 --> 2:02:05.460
 This is the practitioner.

2:02:05.460 --> 2:02:06.700
 Make it your own.

2:02:06.700 --> 2:02:10.700
 Go practice, try heat, cold, light,

2:02:10.700 --> 2:02:14.120
 movement, awareness to this, awareness to this.

2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:16.380
 And this is up to you to make it yours.

2:02:16.380 --> 2:02:19.800
 But we don't like to have this responsibility.

2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:22.140
 No, people prefer to have the,

2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:24.020
 this will work the first time every time

2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:27.780
 and will serve you best compared to everything else.

2:02:27.780 --> 2:02:31.440
 And while there are more reliable tools than others,

2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:34.220
 in my mind, the more reliable tools tend to be ones

2:02:34.220 --> 2:02:38.060
 that are grounded in our innate physiology

2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:41.780
 as opposed to some, I don't like the word hack.

2:02:41.780 --> 2:02:43.660
 In fact, I loathe the word biohack

2:02:43.660 --> 2:02:45.900
 as we were talking about again earlier,

2:02:45.900 --> 2:02:48.340
 because the hack in my mind is something

2:02:48.340 --> 2:02:51.460
 that is designed for one purpose that's used for another.

2:02:51.460 --> 2:02:54.540
 It's not the most efficient use of that tool

2:02:54.540 --> 2:02:57.420
 nor is it naturally the best solution.

2:02:57.420 --> 2:02:59.860
 Whereas biology has some very good solutions,

2:02:59.860 --> 2:03:02.020
 but they don't always work, not every time.

2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:05.100
 I, earlier today, we did a practice in which,

2:03:05.100 --> 2:03:08.660
 which involved invasion, shall we say,

2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:10.540
 of peripersonal space.

2:03:10.540 --> 2:03:13.420
 We weren't standing super close for any particular reason,

2:03:13.420 --> 2:03:14.260
 but there was-

2:03:14.260 --> 2:03:15.100
 God forbid.

2:03:15.100 --> 2:03:15.940
 God forbid.

2:03:15.940 --> 2:03:19.340
 But we, but there was, we were close enough together

2:03:19.340 --> 2:03:21.020
 that we could touch one's torsos

2:03:21.020 --> 2:03:23.340
 and we were doing that as part of this practice.

2:03:23.340 --> 2:03:26.140
 And you encouraged me to pay attention to, you know,

2:03:26.140 --> 2:03:27.660
 how does it feel to have someone

2:03:27.660 --> 2:03:29.540
 in your peripersonal space?

2:03:29.540 --> 2:03:31.460
 And then this notion of reactivity.

2:03:31.460 --> 2:03:33.620
 I find this an immensely interesting

2:03:33.620 --> 2:03:36.140
 and potentially powerful practice

2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:37.940
 because I think a lot of people,

2:03:37.940 --> 2:03:41.220
 I know a lot of people suffer from anxiety

2:03:41.220 --> 2:03:43.500
 just being in a face-to-face conversation.

2:03:43.500 --> 2:03:45.420
 Some people have a lot of anxiety

2:03:45.420 --> 2:03:47.100
 about being physically close to people,

2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:48.940
 whether or not they know them or not.

2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:50.740
 And many people are reactive.

2:03:50.740 --> 2:03:52.580
 They are in that anticipatory state

2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:53.980
 of something is going to happen.

2:03:53.980 --> 2:03:55.660
 And sometimes this relates to trauma

2:03:55.660 --> 2:03:57.380
 and negative experience, but sometimes no.

2:03:57.380 --> 2:04:00.140
 Sometimes they're just not used to being in dynamic,

2:04:00.140 --> 2:04:04.620
 dynamic, excuse me, exchange with other beings.

2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:08.100
 And so one thing that I love about the movement practice

2:04:08.100 --> 2:04:10.300
 and how dynamic is that one can explore that space.

2:04:10.300 --> 2:04:13.540
 Maybe you could talk about that a little bit more.

2:04:13.540 --> 2:04:14.380
 Yeah.

2:04:16.700 --> 2:04:21.700
 Touch, proximity, all these things also taking very,

2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:28.940
 it takes a very, I think, limited place in our lives.

2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:32.100
 People are not touched and they don't touch enough.

2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:35.500
 There is certain bubbles of peripersonal space

2:04:35.500 --> 2:04:37.860
 according to culture, according to environment,

2:04:37.860 --> 2:04:39.180
 what is right, what is wrong.

2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:41.060
 And then came all the, of course,

2:04:41.060 --> 2:04:45.300
 politically correctness and harassment and all kinds.

2:04:45.300 --> 2:04:46.660
 And this is a problem.

2:04:46.660 --> 2:04:50.140
 It's a problem to navigate all this scenario.

2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:53.620
 And I think there is definitely this side

2:04:53.620 --> 2:04:55.380
 which is suffering.

2:04:55.380 --> 2:04:59.700
 People go to BJJ classes to touch, not to learn BJJ.

2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:03.100
 Most of it, they're not even aware of it.

2:05:03.100 --> 2:05:05.900
 Before they would go to a prostitute, maybe.

2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:10.780
 It would not be honest to say that,

2:05:13.380 --> 2:05:16.980
 yeah, this is not required or necessary more in our lives.

2:05:18.220 --> 2:05:19.740
 Children who are not touched,

2:05:19.740 --> 2:05:22.620
 there is a lot of information about that and the problems.

2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:24.500
 But adults who are not touched,

2:05:24.500 --> 2:05:25.900
 there is not a lot of information.

2:05:25.900 --> 2:05:27.980
 And I think it's no less of a problem

2:05:27.980 --> 2:05:32.140
 because it's something that has to be constantly present.

2:05:32.140 --> 2:05:37.140
 And then proximity, being able to, as you said,

2:05:37.260 --> 2:05:41.100
 remove certain reactivity and to learn to control

2:05:43.380 --> 2:05:47.780
 that volume control over how reactive I am

2:05:47.780 --> 2:05:49.100
 and in other scenarios,

2:05:49.100 --> 2:05:51.260
 how do I remove this reactivity altogether

2:05:51.260 --> 2:05:54.460
 is very important for performance and also for our lives.

2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.340
 For clear thinking, et cetera.

2:05:56.340 --> 2:05:58.540
 Because everything is moving through us

2:05:58.540 --> 2:06:01.060
 and is being monitored by us.

2:06:01.060 --> 2:06:03.860
 So everything has the potential to detract us

2:06:03.860 --> 2:06:07.300
 from a certain direction of exploration.

2:06:08.260 --> 2:06:10.260
 And if you're reactive, you're a slave.

2:06:11.500 --> 2:06:13.540
 It becomes worse and worse and worse.

2:06:14.460 --> 2:06:18.540
 Or for example, a fighter or a football player, et cetera,

2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:21.060
 has to know what to take, what not to take.

2:06:21.060 --> 2:06:22.940
 The fact that you can sense more

2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:25.260
 doesn't mean you should react to it.

2:06:25.260 --> 2:06:26.820
 And the practice helps that

2:06:26.820 --> 2:06:29.140
 by bringing people into these scenarios,

2:06:29.140 --> 2:06:31.340
 but oftentimes disarming them.

2:06:31.340 --> 2:06:34.020
 Like when we were working closely today

2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:37.180
 and because you have a certain background

2:06:37.180 --> 2:06:39.300
 with boxing or fighting,

2:06:39.300 --> 2:06:43.620
 I can tell you you are missing some kind of a way

2:06:43.620 --> 2:06:46.380
 to be in that space that is not martial.

2:06:47.580 --> 2:06:50.300
 So you carry a certain tone,

2:06:50.300 --> 2:06:52.260
 although you're a very kind person,

2:06:52.260 --> 2:06:56.060
 but oftentimes you help me without realizing

2:06:56.060 --> 2:06:59.420
 you're holding me with a lot of strength, for example.

2:06:59.420 --> 2:07:03.420
 And it just, it was clear to me

2:07:03.420 --> 2:07:06.260
 you're not fully aware of what is unfolding

2:07:06.260 --> 2:07:09.420
 and it's just, of course, a question of experience.

2:07:09.420 --> 2:07:11.020
 So to be able to be in this scenario,

2:07:11.020 --> 2:07:12.860
 but do something else,

2:07:12.860 --> 2:07:17.020
 which is not geared towards winning, losing competition

2:07:17.020 --> 2:07:19.860
 or just being able to play with another person.

2:07:19.860 --> 2:07:21.860
 Like for example, contact improvisation

2:07:21.860 --> 2:07:24.300
 took that and played with that

2:07:24.300 --> 2:07:25.980
 and the work of Steve Paxton

2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:28.580
 for the ones who are not familiar.

2:07:29.620 --> 2:07:34.620
 So this is where I call it the hybrids become very useful.

2:07:35.580 --> 2:07:40.020
 Like we don't, when you are practicing in this open way,

2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:43.700
 you are not bound by specific rule set

2:07:43.700 --> 2:07:44.940
 or ways of doing things.

2:07:44.940 --> 2:07:49.940
 It can be a fight, but it can be a dance a moment after.

2:07:49.940 --> 2:07:51.940
 Another thing that I learned from Capoeira,

2:07:52.940 --> 2:07:54.740
 the situation is very tricky there

2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:58.300
 because I've seen kids doing cartwheels in Brazil

2:07:58.300 --> 2:08:01.860
 and scissors fall from their pockets.

2:08:01.860 --> 2:08:05.740
 Why would you go with a scissor in your pocket?

2:08:05.740 --> 2:08:08.380
 Obviously there is certain intentions.

2:08:08.380 --> 2:08:10.180
 And then at other times you see backflips

2:08:10.180 --> 2:08:14.700
 and beautiful things, but people die in Capoeira every year.

2:08:15.820 --> 2:08:17.540
 Neck breaks or something.

2:08:17.540 --> 2:08:18.860
 Kicks to the face.

2:08:18.860 --> 2:08:23.100
 Kicks to the face from various violence.

2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:27.340
 It's, I've explored other martial arts and boxing.

2:08:27.340 --> 2:08:30.380
 I was involved with MMA and BJJ,

2:08:30.380 --> 2:08:32.780
 but I tell you the most violent arena is that.

2:08:32.780 --> 2:08:34.900
 Why? Because it's unknown.

2:08:34.900 --> 2:08:36.540
 One moment it's smiles,

2:08:36.540 --> 2:08:38.860
 another moment it's something else and it's uncontrolled.

2:08:38.860 --> 2:08:40.460
 There is no categories, no weights,

2:08:40.460 --> 2:08:42.660
 and it's a street phenomenon.

2:08:42.660 --> 2:08:44.500
 So you have musical instruments.

2:08:44.500 --> 2:08:46.300
 Sometimes they break it on your head.

2:08:46.300 --> 2:08:47.300
 People don't see that,

2:08:47.300 --> 2:08:49.460
 but you can look online on YouTube

2:08:49.460 --> 2:08:51.820
 and see some of that side of Capoeira,

2:08:51.820 --> 2:08:56.300
 which is actually the day-to-day in Brazil

2:08:56.300 --> 2:08:59.540
 and the reality and how things unfolded.

2:08:59.540 --> 2:09:04.460
 So it's very important to explore many ways of being

2:09:04.460 --> 2:09:08.020
 within different distances and spaces from other people

2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.380
 and touched in different ways

2:09:10.380 --> 2:09:14.740
 and not contextualizing it always in the same way.

2:09:14.740 --> 2:09:17.620
 I can touch your chest in one way.

2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:20.700
 I can touch it with the exact same pressure and speed,

2:09:20.700 --> 2:09:22.940
 but it will feel very different.

2:09:22.940 --> 2:09:24.580
 The parameters, I'm not sure.

2:09:24.580 --> 2:09:29.420
 Certain intentions, certain combination of postures or ways,

2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:32.140
 and this is beautiful exploration.

2:09:32.140 --> 2:09:36.100
 Again, I would encourage you and others

2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:38.140
 to explore the discomfort.

2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:42.500
 For example, certain discomfort to be with a man

2:09:42.500 --> 2:09:44.300
 in a certain scenario or with a woman

2:09:44.300 --> 2:09:46.980
 and trying to see what is that,

2:09:46.980 --> 2:09:48.980
 because if we are truly strong,

2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:51.700
 we are not afraid of anything.

2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:56.700
 If we truly know who we are and we are in that exploration,

2:09:56.940 --> 2:10:00.140
 we don't know the end result, but we are in a research

2:10:00.140 --> 2:10:03.140
 and then we are not afraid of being in that order

2:10:03.140 --> 2:10:05.260
 and we don't come out of boundaries

2:10:05.260 --> 2:10:07.780
 and this will improve our culture tremendously.

2:10:07.780 --> 2:10:09.860
 Of course, there must be agreement.

2:10:09.860 --> 2:10:10.940
 You never force yourself,

2:10:10.940 --> 2:10:13.220
 but you meet someone who is also interested

2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:15.460
 in that exploration and then you do it.

2:10:17.100 --> 2:10:19.100
 And there are many scenarios to do that

2:10:19.100 --> 2:10:22.620
 with traditional practices like learning to grapple

2:10:22.620 --> 2:10:27.500
 or going to contact improvisation and studying there

2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:31.260
 or going to dance, to Latin dance class.

2:10:31.260 --> 2:10:35.500
 And there is, of course, my favorite is to create

2:10:35.500 --> 2:10:39.740
 and to come up with your own hybrids of that and scenarios.

2:10:39.740 --> 2:10:42.540
 Communicating with your loved one through movement,

2:10:42.540 --> 2:10:45.180
 not sitting around food and talking,

2:10:46.180 --> 2:10:48.100
 moving together in all kinds of ways.

2:10:48.100 --> 2:10:50.020
 Sometimes it's walking together,

2:10:50.020 --> 2:10:54.300
 but sometimes it's all kinds of, it can be game, playful,

2:10:54.300 --> 2:10:58.220
 it can be romantic and there are many shades.

2:10:58.220 --> 2:11:01.700
 Sex doesn't start here and here, right?

2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:03.100
 It's like, it's continuum

2:11:03.100 --> 2:11:06.140
 and we don't even need to define it in that way.

2:11:06.140 --> 2:11:11.020
 So with time, I think it unlocks a lot of things.

2:11:11.020 --> 2:11:13.860
 People become much stronger in a good sense,

2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:18.860
 in sense of becoming, being, and we abuse less

2:11:19.060 --> 2:11:24.060
 and we can approach, yeah, other aspects to us.

2:11:25.020 --> 2:11:27.300
 I love the idea that through the exploration

2:11:27.300 --> 2:11:30.860
 of a range of physical contacts,

2:11:30.860 --> 2:11:34.500
 provided one knows they can always return to their center,

2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:37.580
 so to speak, then there's a lot of opportunity

2:11:37.580 --> 2:11:38.700
 that opens up.

2:11:38.700 --> 2:11:43.220
 I wish there was more of that encouraged in children's play,

2:11:43.220 --> 2:11:47.020
 but also, as you mentioned, in adult environments,

2:11:47.020 --> 2:11:51.020
 because yeah, nowadays, for all sorts of reasons

2:11:51.020 --> 2:11:52.900
 that you've touched on,

2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:55.220
 the idea of keeping at least an arm's length distance

2:11:55.220 --> 2:11:56.260
 has become critical.

2:11:56.260 --> 2:11:57.180
 There are a lot of environments

2:11:57.180 --> 2:11:59.900
 actually where hugging is not allowed.

2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:01.460
 I don't know what it's like in Israel,

2:12:01.460 --> 2:12:03.820
 but in the States, many institutions here,

2:12:03.820 --> 2:12:06.860
 you're not allowed to touch anyone else's body.

2:12:06.860 --> 2:12:08.540
 There's actually a wonderful study that comes to mind

2:12:08.540 --> 2:12:09.980
 from an Israeli laboratory,

2:12:09.980 --> 2:12:12.500
 a guy named Noam Sobol is over there,

2:12:13.860 --> 2:12:18.460
 who has shown that by recording people's first interactions,

2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:22.460
 that when people meet, if they shake hands,

2:12:22.460 --> 2:12:24.260
 they almost always,

2:12:24.260 --> 2:12:26.500
 I think it's greater than 85% of the time,

2:12:26.500 --> 2:12:29.060
 they will then wipe the chemicals from the other person

2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.380
 onto their own eyes, typically their eyes or their face.

2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:35.780
 This changed a little bit during the whole pandemic thing,

2:12:35.780 --> 2:12:39.740
 but this is thought to be a carryover

2:12:39.740 --> 2:12:40.940
 from what other animals do

2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:43.500
 in terms of exchanging microbiome elements,

2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:44.460
 exchanging chemicals,

2:12:44.460 --> 2:12:47.940
 that we're constantly feeding our subconscious

2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:52.900
 with the chemical, knowledge of the chemical constituents

2:12:52.900 --> 2:12:54.180
 of other people, right?

2:12:54.180 --> 2:12:57.220
 So it goes way beyond how people smell,

2:12:57.220 --> 2:12:58.780
 how they look, et cetera.

2:12:58.780 --> 2:13:01.780
 More touch seems to me just, as you said,

2:13:01.780 --> 2:13:02.740
 provided it's consensual,

2:13:02.740 --> 2:13:05.740
 it seems like it's just a really good thing overall.

2:13:05.740 --> 2:13:09.860
 And I think maybe also important for discharging,

2:13:09.860 --> 2:13:12.340
 discharging certain experiences,

2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:13.940
 remodeling, reframing.

2:13:13.940 --> 2:13:16.620
 So it's like touch is very powerful in that.

2:13:16.620 --> 2:13:19.580
 If you're touched and you're touching a lot,

2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:22.540
 you're unpacking and you experience that touch

2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:26.060
 that maybe has been traumatic and you're reframing it,

2:13:26.060 --> 2:13:27.420
 you have the opportunity,

2:13:29.540 --> 2:13:31.060
 which is something interesting.

2:13:31.060 --> 2:13:36.060
 I've heard some story about some traditional culture

2:13:36.620 --> 2:13:39.660
 in which when you were burned by mistake,

2:13:39.660 --> 2:13:41.620
 they would immediately burn you again.

2:13:43.020 --> 2:13:44.220
 And it made me think,

2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:46.620
 and then there would not be any burn marks

2:13:47.780 --> 2:13:50.900
 and there would not be the same side effects.

2:13:50.900 --> 2:13:51.940
 That's the claim.

2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:55.300
 It made me think, it's like, what's the source of this?

2:13:55.300 --> 2:13:58.220
 And I realized that maybe it allows

2:13:58.220 --> 2:14:00.980
 a certain completion to happen.

2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:04.020
 That in the traumatic moment is not there.

2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:06.980
 So the re-exposure, while you're still open,

2:14:06.980 --> 2:14:08.820
 the pores are still open,

2:14:08.820 --> 2:14:11.340
 allows you to reframe the experience.

2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:15.020
 And then the unfolding of the rest of the event

2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:16.540
 is very different.

2:14:16.540 --> 2:14:19.020
 This is if you're touching and you're practicing

2:14:19.020 --> 2:14:20.900
 the day-to-day and you're working with people

2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:22.980
 and you're being touched and people come closer

2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:25.060
 or further away, it happens naturally.

2:14:27.380 --> 2:14:30.140
 Yeah, and if you pass a certain limit

2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:32.340
 and it becomes too much,

2:14:32.340 --> 2:14:34.420
 there is always, of course, communication

2:14:34.420 --> 2:14:36.500
 that has to be present.

2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:40.660
 Certain cultures make this communication pre.

2:14:40.660 --> 2:14:43.300
 Certain cultures post.

2:14:43.300 --> 2:14:46.940
 The Israeli, for example, post, here, pre.

2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:48.540
 Ah, so in Israel, they'll say,

2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:50.540
 that didn't feel good to me or that felt good

2:14:50.540 --> 2:14:51.900
 or that was fine?

2:14:51.900 --> 2:14:53.660
 Yeah, it would be more common.

2:14:55.180 --> 2:14:57.340
 Here in the airport, the guy's telling me,

2:14:57.340 --> 2:15:00.740
 I'm gonna slide my hands up towards your crotch

2:15:00.740 --> 2:15:02.900
 until I meet a hard stop.

2:15:03.980 --> 2:15:06.820
 And then he does this in a way

2:15:06.820 --> 2:15:10.940
 that is supposed to show me I have no enjoyment in that.

2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:13.140
 And for me, it just feels aggressive.

2:15:14.060 --> 2:15:17.140
 But his intention is good, showing me.

2:15:17.140 --> 2:15:19.100
 But if it was a loving touch,

2:15:19.100 --> 2:15:21.500
 it would be nicer for me, actually.

2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:24.580
 Personally, it would be gentle,

2:15:24.580 --> 2:15:27.020
 but he goes up there and he shows me,

2:15:27.020 --> 2:15:29.020
 I have no enjoyment in this.

2:15:29.020 --> 2:15:33.420
 But, oh, that's my testicle right there.

2:15:33.420 --> 2:15:37.300
 So it's different choices.

2:15:37.300 --> 2:15:38.740
 I don't think it's like worse,

2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:42.380
 but this description can be a bit dissociated

2:15:42.380 --> 2:15:44.020
 and what does it make me think?

2:15:44.020 --> 2:15:46.660
 Is it truly what he feels or not?

2:15:46.660 --> 2:15:49.500
 Because it feels robotic, so it's not,

2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:51.580
 so sometimes I'd rather not say it

2:15:51.580 --> 2:15:54.340
 and I'm going to touch your chest

2:15:54.340 --> 2:15:57.000
 and just place my hand on the chest

2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.980
 and of course, we can't avoid the problem.

2:16:00.980 --> 2:16:02.460
 I'm not suggesting that there is,

2:16:02.460 --> 2:16:04.140
 but there is an examination

2:16:04.140 --> 2:16:06.820
 and because I moved around the world,

2:16:06.820 --> 2:16:09.420
 I've seen many things and I've seen benefits here,

2:16:09.420 --> 2:16:13.380
 benefits there and in the practice,

2:16:13.380 --> 2:16:15.820
 I think it's important to discuss this, to examine this.

2:16:15.820 --> 2:16:19.620
 I don't have a solution, but it's something to talk about.

2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:20.920
 It is something to talk about

2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:23.060
 and I'm glad you raised it because I think that

2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:26.340
 it's so clear to me that much of the value

2:16:26.340 --> 2:16:28.940
 of a movement practice involves this dynamic interaction

2:16:28.940 --> 2:16:30.420
 with somebody else, where as you pointed out,

2:16:30.420 --> 2:16:32.340
 it can be performed on one's own

2:16:32.340 --> 2:16:34.420
 and practiced throughout one's day,

2:16:34.420 --> 2:16:39.060
 but the unpredictability is a key element to all of it

2:16:39.060 --> 2:16:43.420
 and bringing out all the potential that you've described.

2:16:44.460 --> 2:16:48.620
 In reference to this notion of trauma and burn and re-burn,

2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:50.460
 my colleague at Stanford, David Spiegel,

2:16:50.460 --> 2:16:54.100
 he works on trauma and he's a,

2:16:54.100 --> 2:16:55.180
 actually on this podcast,

2:16:55.180 --> 2:16:58.080
 he voiced that he's against things like trigger warnings

2:16:58.080 --> 2:16:59.860
 because of the way that it puts the nervous system

2:16:59.860 --> 2:17:02.540
 into this state of readiness and reactivity

2:17:02.540 --> 2:17:05.280
 that can exacerbate problems,

2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:09.540
 whereas it's very clear from the literature on trauma

2:17:09.540 --> 2:17:12.100
 and trauma relief that the way to deal with that

2:17:12.100 --> 2:17:14.040
 is through a controlled,

2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.660
 but clearly a controlled re-exposure to the trauma

2:17:17.660 --> 2:17:20.580
 in order to diminish the emotional response over time.

2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:21.900
 I mean, it's very clear.

2:17:21.900 --> 2:17:23.240
 If we avoid the thing,

2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:25.100
 obviously we don't want to re-injure ourselves

2:17:25.100 --> 2:17:26.140
 or re-traumatize,

2:17:26.140 --> 2:17:28.100
 but if one avoids the thing that makes them upset

2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:28.940
 over and over,

2:17:28.940 --> 2:17:30.020
 all it does is serve to create

2:17:30.020 --> 2:17:31.480
 a heightened state of readiness.

2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:33.420
 It primes more trauma.

2:17:33.420 --> 2:17:35.020
 So I think it makes good sense.

2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:38.260
 I think impressions are very useful here also

2:17:38.260 --> 2:17:42.240
 when stepping into an area in which trauma can occur.

2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:46.160
 And then by going through the impression

2:17:46.160 --> 2:17:47.720
 that it already occurred,

2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:50.720
 you create some kind of a thermal layer of protection.

2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:55.720
 So I've already been hit when I'm entering that space.

2:17:56.700 --> 2:17:58.420
 It's so beneficial.

2:17:58.420 --> 2:18:01.900
 Or I've already been touched in a way that I didn't like

2:18:01.900 --> 2:18:03.960
 if I go to a contact improvisation class.

2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:06.500
 And just running this scenario in your head

2:18:07.660 --> 2:18:10.220
 protects so well.

2:18:10.220 --> 2:18:11.140
 Yeah.

2:18:11.140 --> 2:18:13.100
 I'm glad you mentioned running scenarios in your head.

2:18:13.100 --> 2:18:15.780
 I've been curious all day as to whether or not

2:18:15.780 --> 2:18:18.900
 you do visualization or mental rehearsal

2:18:18.900 --> 2:18:21.080
 of physical movement.

2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:24.560
 This seems to be a popular idea in the States.

2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:26.260
 People are always asking me,

2:18:26.260 --> 2:18:29.840
 can you just imagine a movement and learn it better

2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:32.380
 than were you to actually perform it?

2:18:32.380 --> 2:18:33.660
 My hunch based on,

2:18:33.660 --> 2:18:35.780
 and my understanding of the scientific literature

2:18:35.780 --> 2:18:39.300
 is that visualization can be useful to some extent

2:18:39.300 --> 2:18:41.740
 for people that are very good at visualization,

2:18:41.740 --> 2:18:43.900
 but for many people, it doesn't help.

2:18:43.900 --> 2:18:47.400
 And that there's nothing like real physical practice

2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:50.640
 to improve physical practice.

2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:53.580
 Yeah, the word visualization is not good, obviously.

2:18:54.740 --> 2:18:57.980
 It has to be experientialization

2:18:59.140 --> 2:19:02.240
 in a very complete way, not just visually, of course.

2:19:03.820 --> 2:19:08.820
 And unless you already developed certain experience,

2:19:10.540 --> 2:19:14.820
 tangible experience that has benefited from feedback,

2:19:14.820 --> 2:19:16.160
 from outside feedback,

2:19:16.160 --> 2:19:20.160
 it is not a very useful thing to do.

2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:24.360
 And it ends up being fabrications.

2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:25.860
 But if you're very experienced

2:19:25.860 --> 2:19:29.160
 and you already gained the benefit of being burnt here

2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:30.960
 or overextended here,

2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:32.520
 then you have a certain experience

2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:35.400
 and then you can strengthen certain aspects of it,

2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:38.300
 but you gotta be careful because you do not have feedback.

2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:41.040
 And because of the missing feedback,

2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:43.120
 you might develop delusions.

2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:46.560
 It might be that you develop a stronger patterning,

2:19:46.560 --> 2:19:49.640
 but ultimately, this would lead you away

2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:54.360
 from the aliveness of the movement itself.

2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:56.600
 Drilling, for example.

2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:01.600
 Very useful to learn a general infrastructure

2:20:01.720 --> 2:20:04.360
 of the movement sleeve or the technique.

2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:07.340
 But then to dress it up, you need feedback.

2:20:07.340 --> 2:20:09.440
 You need it to be alive.

2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:14.160
 You need to receive something corrective.

2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:15.760
 I love it.

2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:18.240
 For many people, they approach movement

2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:21.540
 in the form of weight training or yoga or running.

2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:24.020
 Yoga's a bit more dynamic,

2:20:24.020 --> 2:20:29.020
 but fairly linear types of exercise and movement.

2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:33.040
 Peloton, rowing, those kinds of things.

2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:37.000
 I think most people will probably not depart

2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:38.720
 from those practices entirely

2:20:38.720 --> 2:20:39.680
 because they like them.

2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:41.160
 I'm speaking about myself.

2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:42.340
 I like some of those very much.

2:20:42.340 --> 2:20:43.180
 I enjoy them.

2:20:44.260 --> 2:20:47.680
 But in terms of thinking about adding a movement practice

2:20:47.680 --> 2:20:51.060
 to one's already existing exercise regime,

2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:54.360
 I can imagine threading it throughout the day.

2:20:54.360 --> 2:20:56.760
 I can imagine having a dedicated movement practice.

2:20:56.760 --> 2:20:59.720
 One thing that I have started doing

2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:01.840
 on the basis of some of your teachings,

2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:03.200
 and I just sort of created this idea,

2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:05.880
 is rather than statically standing there and lifting weights,

2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:08.600
 actually walking as I alternate repetitions,

2:21:08.600 --> 2:21:13.600
 it occurred to me that I'd never done a bicep curl

2:21:13.800 --> 2:21:15.960
 with one foot in front of the other,

2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.840
 and then I'd never actually switched that up.

2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:20.280
 And it's kind of an odd stance

2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:22.280
 to be standing in parallel and curling one's arm.

2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:23.680
 It's kind of a ridiculous movement

2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:24.840
 when one thinks about it.

2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:26.120
 So I started incorporating some of that.

2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:27.560
 You get some strange looks in the gym,

2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:29.760
 but I just give them strange looks back.

2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:32.320
 So what are your thoughts

2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:34.740
 about these very linear forms of exercise?

2:21:34.740 --> 2:21:39.580
 And do you encourage people to expand the play space,

2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:43.020
 as it were, for these kinds of exercise?

2:21:43.020 --> 2:21:44.640
 Or do you think that movement practice

2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:49.640
 is just best explored through three-dimensionality,

2:21:50.040 --> 2:21:52.940
 gravity, and maybe a stick or a ball?

2:21:54.700 --> 2:21:58.100
 It's definitely a problem, and it's approachable.

2:21:58.100 --> 2:22:00.900
 People want a quick, people want a hack.

2:22:00.900 --> 2:22:05.620
 People want the icing, there is no cake, there is no cake.

2:22:05.620 --> 2:22:08.620
 And it's just like industries of icing, icing.

2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:09.780
 Icing on what?

2:22:09.780 --> 2:22:11.300
 What are you putting it on?

2:22:11.300 --> 2:22:16.140
 So for me, that's why I'm going towards this side.

2:22:16.140 --> 2:22:18.100
 It's like, I have my life.

2:22:18.100 --> 2:22:21.180
 Now tell me what movement practices I should pursue.

2:22:22.300 --> 2:22:23.540
 You are movement.

2:22:24.580 --> 2:22:28.140
 In essence, you are not thinking of yourself

2:22:28.140 --> 2:22:32.060
 in any serious way through my eyes.

2:22:32.940 --> 2:22:35.960
 There is a dynamic entity to you.

2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:39.820
 The body is a huge part of it, communicating.

2:22:39.820 --> 2:22:42.540
 You have genetic layers.

2:22:42.540 --> 2:22:45.180
 There is personalities that got developed

2:22:45.180 --> 2:22:47.420
 and built around various influences,

2:22:47.420 --> 2:22:49.900
 but then there is also some kind of an essence,

2:22:49.900 --> 2:22:53.660
 something that reeks from within the cells.

2:22:53.660 --> 2:22:56.420
 And if you grew up in my family

2:22:56.420 --> 2:22:57.660
 and I grew up in your family,

2:22:57.660 --> 2:22:59.660
 and it would still be the same.

2:22:59.660 --> 2:23:02.500
 And it's something that I always try to think about.

2:23:02.500 --> 2:23:04.040
 What is that inside of me?

2:23:06.460 --> 2:23:09.340
 So I think these practices, they're very good,

2:23:09.340 --> 2:23:11.980
 but they're not designed for the goal

2:23:11.980 --> 2:23:14.520
 that we think they were designed to.

2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:17.380
 It orients towards something else.

2:23:17.380 --> 2:23:19.300
 For example, yoga.

2:23:19.300 --> 2:23:22.120
 There is a good book called The Yoga Body,

2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:25.260
 which will destroy a lot of people's yoga practice.

2:23:25.260 --> 2:23:29.620
 And it goes into, how did we get to this yoga?

2:23:29.620 --> 2:23:32.140
 The influence of Swedish gymnastics

2:23:32.140 --> 2:23:35.900
 and Mongolian contortionists

2:23:35.900 --> 2:23:40.580
 and the Western, the West, affecting it.

2:23:40.580 --> 2:23:42.100
 And then the ancient practice,

2:23:42.100 --> 2:23:47.100
 which was barely asana-related posture, position.

2:23:47.260 --> 2:23:49.500
 So actually, you said yoga is less linear.

2:23:49.500 --> 2:23:53.540
 Yoga is very linear, very linear these days, these lines.

2:23:53.540 --> 2:23:55.420
 Look at all the traditional dances.

2:23:55.420 --> 2:23:58.060
 They look like nothing like yoga.

2:23:58.060 --> 2:23:59.580
 Look at Thai dance.

2:23:59.580 --> 2:24:02.260
 Look at Chinese dances, martial arts.

2:24:02.260 --> 2:24:03.660
 It's all rounded, it's all curled.

2:24:03.660 --> 2:24:06.780
 It's like out nature, what you see in nature

2:24:06.780 --> 2:24:09.340
 and the movement of the animals.

2:24:09.340 --> 2:24:11.820
 So where does it come from?

2:24:11.820 --> 2:24:13.220
 These are things to understand

2:24:13.220 --> 2:24:16.060
 because it designs you now, it shapes you.

2:24:16.060 --> 2:24:19.620
 You're placing yourself in these forces of change

2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:21.500
 and these streams of change.

2:24:21.500 --> 2:24:22.820
 And you have a good intention.

2:24:22.820 --> 2:24:27.100
 You just want this or that, but the joke is on us.

2:24:27.100 --> 2:24:32.020
 And this is the movement practice for me is first education.

2:24:32.020 --> 2:24:33.620
 Let's start to think about this.

2:24:33.620 --> 2:24:37.820
 I have nothing that I can just sprinkle now,

2:24:37.820 --> 2:24:41.060
 some magic powder that will help resolve this

2:24:41.060 --> 2:24:43.820
 because it's a start of a deep investigation.

2:24:45.300 --> 2:24:48.500
 And then some of the things, let's talk pragmatically

2:24:48.500 --> 2:24:51.980
 because what you described is not about you placing

2:24:51.980 --> 2:24:53.780
 the foot in front when you're curling.

2:24:53.780 --> 2:24:56.420
 It's about the examination.

2:24:56.420 --> 2:25:00.220
 This is why it is a very good direction.

2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:02.460
 And then you will need another one, another one.

2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:04.780
 Don't get stuck on that foot in front

2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:06.940
 and try to do with the eyes closed

2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:08.180
 or with a different head posture

2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:11.820
 and you will see things arrive, unrelated things

2:25:11.820 --> 2:25:14.580
 because the associative mind, the thinking,

2:25:14.580 --> 2:25:17.580
 this relates to this doesn't get to the heart of it, never.

2:25:17.580 --> 2:25:22.580
 So just infusing these elements like in a cup

2:25:26.020 --> 2:25:30.060
 will create endless combinations, possibilities

2:25:30.060 --> 2:25:31.940
 and a lot of discovery.

2:25:31.940 --> 2:25:34.500
 And this for me is humility of the practitioner.

2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:37.260
 I don't know, I try, like today with you,

2:25:37.260 --> 2:25:41.100
 I tried various combinations and oh, I discover something.

2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:43.300
 Oh, this is a playful approach

2:25:43.300 --> 2:25:45.500
 and this is a researcher approach.

2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:49.540
 I don't try to fit my truth into something.

2:25:49.540 --> 2:25:51.820
 I'm there to examine.

2:25:51.820 --> 2:25:53.580
 I don't have a motive yet.

2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:54.980
 Why?

2:25:54.980 --> 2:25:56.660
 Because I'm fine.

2:25:56.660 --> 2:25:59.300
 I don't depend on that to define myself.

2:25:59.300 --> 2:26:02.660
 I'm a human being, but if I don't have that sense of worth,

2:26:02.660 --> 2:26:06.100
 I'm already like geared towards I need to do this.

2:26:06.100 --> 2:26:07.060
 I need to prove this.

2:26:07.060 --> 2:26:08.340
 I have this agenda.

2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:10.860
 And this is how we get all the lies in the world

2:26:10.860 --> 2:26:13.700
 and all the problems and difficulties.

2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:17.540
 So these practices, they are related to it,

2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:19.820
 to prove this, that, this way,

2:26:20.900 --> 2:26:23.900
 why we need muscles for X, Y, Z.

2:26:23.900 --> 2:26:28.900
 And a lot of the reported outcomes

2:26:29.460 --> 2:26:32.380
 are often from my places like funny.

2:26:32.380 --> 2:26:33.900
 I hear about something like,

2:26:33.900 --> 2:26:36.620
 I heard you say about gratitude practice,

2:26:37.540 --> 2:26:41.740
 that actually experiencing from outside

2:26:41.740 --> 2:26:44.260
 as if somebody else or you are receiving gratitude

2:26:44.260 --> 2:26:45.580
 is actually more powerful.

2:26:46.540 --> 2:26:48.900
 It's true, but I see why it's true.

2:26:48.900 --> 2:26:50.620
 I'm not sure everybody sees.

2:26:50.620 --> 2:26:53.340
 If somebody tries to feel gratitude,

2:26:53.340 --> 2:26:57.740
 just sit with the eyes closed or watch a movie

2:26:57.740 --> 2:27:00.500
 and sense the gratitude there, it would be clear to you.

2:27:00.500 --> 2:27:03.860
 One is very difficult to do and the other is very easy.

2:27:03.860 --> 2:27:06.500
 Hence, if gratitude is achieved easier this way,

2:27:06.500 --> 2:27:08.420
 that's why it works like that.

2:27:08.420 --> 2:27:11.860
 Although all the traditional practices are about you,

2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:16.420
 and by challenging yourself to sense that gratitude yourself

2:27:16.420 --> 2:27:17.820
 they achieve much more powerful thing.

2:27:17.820 --> 2:27:19.980
 But this is not the research people,

2:27:19.980 --> 2:27:21.500
 the people in the research.

2:27:21.500 --> 2:27:23.460
 We don't have a lot of those people.

2:27:23.460 --> 2:27:27.300
 So a lot of the things that can arrive to us,

2:27:27.300 --> 2:27:29.540
 weight training, the benefits,

2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:34.060
 or the way that the hormonal effects,

2:27:34.060 --> 2:27:37.260
 the effect over cognition, et cetera.

2:27:37.260 --> 2:27:39.700
 When you open a bit and you go far out,

2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:42.420
 you see certain things, not the truth,

2:27:42.420 --> 2:27:44.500
 but maybe less delusion.

2:27:45.780 --> 2:27:48.020
 There is nothing definite,

2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:53.020
 but there is something maybe more wholesome that appears.

2:27:58.500 --> 2:28:03.500
 Yeah, I think this is a state of exploration.

2:28:03.500 --> 2:28:08.500
 Exploration, I don't want to have the same thought

2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:09.860
 if I already had it.

2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:14.300
 Why would I want to have the same thought?

2:28:14.300 --> 2:28:15.980
 I already had it.

2:28:15.980 --> 2:28:18.540
 I don't want to have the same practice.

2:28:18.540 --> 2:28:22.220
 I don't want it, I curled already in this way.

2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:23.820
 I want to experience something else.

2:28:23.820 --> 2:28:26.620
 I want to, there is a benefit to gain.

2:28:26.620 --> 2:28:27.940
 No, but that was better.

2:28:27.940 --> 2:28:32.940
 The better is better, is not more, is not faster.

2:28:37.140 --> 2:28:40.180
 Better is better, and better isn't,

2:28:40.180 --> 2:28:41.940
 we don't know what better is, right?

2:28:41.940 --> 2:28:43.460
 So it's like, it's open.

2:28:43.460 --> 2:28:45.740
 Oh, this is better, I don't know.

2:28:45.740 --> 2:28:48.260
 It's just more weight, it's one more kilo.

2:28:48.260 --> 2:28:50.140
 But maybe if I remove one kilo,

2:28:51.820 --> 2:28:54.860
 I discover something like, for example,

2:28:54.860 --> 2:28:58.940
 our development that has been shown

2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:01.420
 to gain certain benefits when you lighten the load

2:29:01.420 --> 2:29:03.940
 and you accelerate it more in certain conditions.

2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:05.020
 But who discovered it?

2:29:05.020 --> 2:29:07.380
 A practitioner, a math person.

2:29:08.700 --> 2:29:11.420
 Not Verkhoshensky, Zatsyorsky.

2:29:11.420 --> 2:29:16.340
 They reported something, but it was already

2:29:16.340 --> 2:29:19.100
 within the grasp of the practitioners.

2:29:19.100 --> 2:29:24.100
 And I think, and as a researcher, this is very powerful

2:29:24.100 --> 2:29:27.540
 to remind yourself this and to work with that.

2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:29.620
 And as a practitioner, as a living human being,

2:29:29.620 --> 2:29:32.620
 for everyone, I think something very useful.

2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:35.420
 And then those plays that you're doing,

2:29:37.300 --> 2:29:40.660
 people give you the weird looks, and it's like,

2:29:40.660 --> 2:29:43.060
 yeah, I tell people, you don't want to be normal.

2:29:45.060 --> 2:29:46.460
 If you don't get the weird looks,

2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:49.220
 you're not moving in the right direction.

2:29:49.220 --> 2:29:53.580
 You're moving in a very fixed and,

2:29:53.580 --> 2:29:55.620
 you already know the result of that direction,

2:29:55.620 --> 2:29:57.460
 let's say at least that.

2:29:57.460 --> 2:30:00.980
 So continue to play with that, continue to play,

2:30:00.980 --> 2:30:03.580
 look elsewhere, look at places you didn't look at,

2:30:03.580 --> 2:30:05.500
 because this is still like within the same layer,

2:30:05.500 --> 2:30:07.860
 one foot in front, one foot behind.

2:30:07.860 --> 2:30:10.940
 What happens when you do it with a smile?

2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:14.380
 The same workout, and when you do it with a frown.

2:30:16.220 --> 2:30:20.380
 Or what happens, breath-holding or blood restrictions?

2:30:20.380 --> 2:30:25.380
 All this is great play and I think very beneficial

2:30:25.540 --> 2:30:26.620
 to do, to go through.

2:30:28.060 --> 2:30:29.020
 Love it.

2:30:29.020 --> 2:30:31.580
 I think it's a wonderful message.

2:30:31.580 --> 2:30:34.780
 What I keep hearing from you over and over again is too,

2:30:34.780 --> 2:30:39.140
 that people should explore, explore, explore.

2:30:39.140 --> 2:30:44.140
 And listen, I want to thank you for your time today,

2:30:44.140 --> 2:30:47.140
 first of all, for the incredible teachings

2:30:47.140 --> 2:30:50.140
 here at this table, but also the introduction

2:30:50.140 --> 2:30:52.140
 to a movement practice.

2:30:52.140 --> 2:30:53.220
 Although now I'm tempted to say

2:30:53.220 --> 2:30:54.540
 that I've been moving my whole life.

2:30:54.540 --> 2:30:56.100
 I've just didn't know I was,

2:30:56.100 --> 2:30:57.940
 that it was such a vast landscape.

2:30:59.580 --> 2:31:03.860
 Also that your willingness to tread out in this journey

2:31:03.860 --> 2:31:07.220
 that is truly unique, the greatest compliment

2:31:07.220 --> 2:31:08.940
 that one can give in science is the one

2:31:08.940 --> 2:31:10.460
 that I'm going to tell you now,

2:31:10.460 --> 2:31:11.780
 because it's entirely appropriate,

2:31:11.780 --> 2:31:14.420
 which is we say you're an N of one, right?

2:31:14.420 --> 2:31:16.060
 That, and you truly are.

2:31:16.060 --> 2:31:19.820
 I don't think there's anyone that has been as willing

2:31:19.820 --> 2:31:23.060
 to embrace existing practices, evolve them,

2:31:23.060 --> 2:31:28.020
 create new practices, and to share so broadly

2:31:28.020 --> 2:31:31.140
 to really be willing to give and teach so much knowledge.

2:31:31.140 --> 2:31:33.620
 You know, earlier you made the mention of your goals

2:31:33.620 --> 2:31:37.440
 of in part of being wild and wise,

2:31:37.440 --> 2:31:41.200
 and I'm here to tell you that you are both wild and wise.

2:31:41.200 --> 2:31:43.020
 And so thank you so much.

2:31:43.020 --> 2:31:43.980
 Thank you very much.

2:31:43.980 --> 2:31:44.900
 Thank you.

2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:46.860
 Thank you for joining me today for my discussion

2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:33.640
 And if you have suggestions about topics or podcast guests

2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:35.560
 that you'd like us to cover on the podcast,

2:32:35.560 --> 2:32:37.440
 if you have criticism or questions,

2:32:37.440 --> 2:32:40.260
 please put those in the comment section on YouTube.

2:32:40.260 --> 2:32:42.520
 We do read all those comments.

2:32:42.520 --> 2:32:44.220
 Please also check out the sponsors mentioned

2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:45.740
 at the beginning of today's podcast.

2:32:45.740 --> 2:32:48.140
 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:32:48.140 --> 2:32:49.260
 Not on today's episode,

2:32:49.260 --> 2:32:51.820
 but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:32:51.820 --> 2:32:53.300
 we discuss supplements.

2:32:53.300 --> 2:32:55.440
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:32:55.440 --> 2:32:57.500
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:32:57.500 --> 2:33:00.280
 or could derive tremendous benefit from them.

2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:02.180
 For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:04.640
 has decided to partner with Momentus.

2:33:04.640 --> 2:33:07.060
 We decided to partner with Momentus because first of all,

2:33:07.060 --> 2:33:08.980
 they are of the absolute highest quality.

2:33:08.980 --> 2:33:11.020
 Second of all, they ship anywhere in the world.

2:33:11.020 --> 2:33:13.020
 And third, we wanted to have one site

2:33:13.020 --> 2:33:14.740
 that people could go to where they could find

2:33:14.740 --> 2:33:16.980
 the supplements that are discussed on this podcast

2:33:16.980 --> 2:33:19.660
 in the various dosages and single ingredient forms

2:33:19.660 --> 2:33:23.460
 that we often suggest or point people to on the podcast.

2:33:23.460 --> 2:33:25.420
 So if you'd like to see the supplements that I take

2:33:25.420 --> 2:33:27.380
 or that have been mentioned on the podcast,

2:33:27.380 --> 2:33:30.300
 please go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman

2:33:30.300 --> 2:33:32.860
 and they're listed there as well as available there.

2:33:32.860 --> 2:33:35.220
 If you're not already following us on social media,

2:33:35.220 --> 2:33:38.700
 we are Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.

2:33:38.700 --> 2:33:41.040
 Both places I do short posts about science

2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:42.260
 and science related tools,

2:33:42.260 --> 2:33:43.860
 some of which overlap with the content

2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:45.380
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:33:45.380 --> 2:33:47.920
 and other of which is distinct from the information

2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:49.100
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:33:49.100 --> 2:33:50.680
 So again, that's Huberman Lab on Twitter

2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:52.540
 and Huberman Lab on Instagram.

2:33:52.540 --> 2:33:55.180
 We also have a newsletter that many people find useful.

2:33:55.180 --> 2:33:57.240
 This is a completely zero cost newsletter.

2:33:57.240 --> 2:33:59.220
 You can find it by going to HubermanLab.com,

2:33:59.220 --> 2:34:00.820
 click on the menu and go to newsletter

2:34:00.820 --> 2:34:01.940
 and you sign up with your email.

2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:03.740
 We do not share your email with anybody

2:34:03.740 --> 2:34:06.680
 and we have a very clear privacy policy listed there.

2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:09.220
 You can also get access at the very same site

2:34:09.220 --> 2:34:11.220
 to newsletters from the past

2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:14.100
 to see if those newsletters are indeed of interest to you.

2:34:14.100 --> 2:34:16.660
 We have newsletters about a toolkit for sleep, for instance,

2:34:16.660 --> 2:34:19.020
 or a neuroplasticity super protocol

2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:21.260
 that incorporates a lot of different podcast episodes

2:34:21.260 --> 2:34:23.580
 and themes that you might find useful.

2:34:23.580 --> 2:34:26.260
 Again, that's HubermanLab.com and go to the menu

2:34:26.260 --> 2:34:28.540
 and click on newsletter and sign up.

2:34:28.540 --> 2:34:30.640
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:32.500
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:34:32.500 --> 2:34:44.500
 I'll see you in the next one.
