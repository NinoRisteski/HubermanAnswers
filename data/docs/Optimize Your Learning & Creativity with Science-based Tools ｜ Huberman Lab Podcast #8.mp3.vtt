00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.880
 My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:10.880 --> 00:13.920
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.920 --> 00:15.980
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.980 --> 00:17.700
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.700 --> 00:19.420
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.460
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.460 --> 00:23.380
 to bring you zero cost to consumer information

00:23.380 --> 00:26.260
 about science and science-related tools.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.460
 In keeping with that theme,

00:27.460 --> 00:30.400
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.960
 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.260
 InsideTracker analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:36.260 --> 00:38.160
 to help you better understand your body

00:38.160 --> 00:40.620
 and health and health needs.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.160
 I've been getting my blood tested for many years now

00:43.160 --> 00:46.240
 because it just turns out that many of the things

00:46.240 --> 00:47.940
 that are important to our health and wellbeing

00:47.940 --> 00:51.740
 can only be detected in a blood test or a DNA test.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.900
 InsideTracker makes that really easy.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.740
 They can come to your house to take those samples

00:55.740 --> 00:59.860
 if you like, or you can go to a nearby clinic as well.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.900
 The major problem with most blood tests and DNA tests

01:02.900 --> 01:04.460
 is that it's very hard to make sense

01:04.460 --> 01:05.740
 of the information you get.

01:05.740 --> 01:08.260
 You get a lot of numbers related to metabolic factors,

01:08.260 --> 01:10.180
 endocrine factors, et cetera.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.920
 InsideTracker makes it very easy to decipher

01:12.920 --> 01:16.840
 what those levels in your blood and DNA mean

01:16.840 --> 01:18.540
 and what to do about them.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.540
 They have a very easy to use dashboard

01:20.540 --> 01:23.620
 that if you go to it, it can inform about lifestyle choices

01:23.620 --> 01:26.720
 such as adding or subtracting certain forms of exercise

01:26.720 --> 01:30.220
 or nutrition, other things related to supplementation.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.140
 It's a really powerful and easy to use program.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.320
 If you wanna try InsideTracker,

01:35.320 --> 01:38.500
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

01:38.500 --> 01:41.300
 and put Huberman at checkout to get 25% off

01:41.300 --> 01:42.660
 any of their programs.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.380
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

01:45.380 --> 01:46.920
 and put Huberman at checkout.

01:48.340 --> 01:51.900
 The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.640
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral

01:54.640 --> 01:56.300
 probiotic drink.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.300
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

01:59.300 --> 02:01.940
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:01.940 --> 02:03.520
 I started using Athletic Greens

02:03.520 --> 02:05.700
 and I still use Athletic Greens

02:05.700 --> 02:09.340
 because I find it very complicated and almost dizzying

02:09.340 --> 02:11.620
 to figure out which vitamins and minerals I need to take

02:11.620 --> 02:14.540
 in order to just cover my nutritional basis.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.860
 Taking Athletic Greens makes that very easy.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.220
 It also tastes very good.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.860
 I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon juice

02:20.860 --> 02:23.880
 and I really like it so I drink it once or twice a day.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.940
 The probiotics that are in Athletic Greens

02:25.940 --> 02:27.500
 are also important to me

02:27.500 --> 02:29.420
 because there are a lot of data now showing

02:29.420 --> 02:33.100
 that the gut microbiome, which is supported by probiotics,

02:33.100 --> 02:35.600
 is important for things like the gut brain access,

02:35.600 --> 02:38.540
 mood, endocrine factors, metabolism,

02:38.540 --> 02:40.620
 many, many biological functions.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.260
 And so by taking Athletic Greens,

02:42.260 --> 02:44.300
 I get the vitamins, the minerals and the probiotics

02:44.300 --> 02:48.380
 all in one easy to consume, great tasting drink.

02:48.380 --> 02:49.940
 If you wanna try Athletic Greens,

02:49.940 --> 02:53.140
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

02:53.140 --> 02:56.380
 And if you do that, you'll also get a one-year supply

02:56.380 --> 02:59.300
 of liquid vitamin D3K2.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.420
 There are a lot of data now as well showing

03:01.420 --> 03:04.400
 that vitamin D3 is important for immune function,

03:04.400 --> 03:06.460
 for mood, endocrine factors,

03:06.460 --> 03:09.680
 as well as other systems in the brain and body.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.020
 That's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.620
 And I should also mention, if you do that,

03:13.620 --> 03:16.520
 you won't just get the vitamin D3K2, your supply,

03:16.520 --> 03:20.680
 you'll also get five free travel packs of Athletic Greens.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.500
 Mixing up powders when one is on the road,

03:22.500 --> 03:25.820
 either in the car or in a hotel or on the plane, et cetera,

03:25.820 --> 03:26.660
 can be kind of messy.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.180
 These little travel packs make it really clean and easy.

03:29.180 --> 03:32.260
 So once again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:32.260 --> 03:34.640
 you'll get a special offer of your Athletic Greens,

03:34.640 --> 03:38.220
 but you'll also get the year supply of vitamin D3K2

03:38.220 --> 03:40.460
 and the five free travel packs.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.460
 The third sponsor of today's podcast is Made For.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.300
 Made For is a behavioral science company

03:45.300 --> 03:47.820
 that makes attaining positive changes

03:47.820 --> 03:51.420
 and growth mindset easy through a simple set of steps

03:51.420 --> 03:53.060
 and a monthly program.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.000
 The company was founded by former Navy Seal,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.620
 Patrick Dossett and Tom's founder, Blake Mycoskie.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.740
 I'm the head of their scientific advisory board.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.580
 And the other members of the advisory board

04:02.580 --> 04:05.260
 include people like the director of the Chronobiology Unit

04:05.260 --> 04:07.220
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

04:07.220 --> 04:08.900
 members of Harvard Medical School,

04:08.900 --> 04:11.700
 and many other people who are serious about taking science

04:11.700 --> 04:14.460
 and developing protocols that can be applied

04:14.460 --> 04:17.580
 towards positive habits and growth mindset.

04:17.580 --> 04:19.260
 If you want to check out Made For,

04:19.260 --> 04:21.380
 you can go to getmadefor.com

04:21.380 --> 04:23.340
 and if you purchase any of their products

04:23.340 --> 04:25.180
 and put Huberman at checkout,

04:25.180 --> 04:27.020
 you'll get 20% off their program.

04:27.020 --> 04:30.100
 In addition to that, we do a monthly Zoom call

04:30.100 --> 04:31.920
 where the members of Made For get on

04:31.920 --> 04:35.720
 and Patrick and myself, sometimes Blake as well,

04:35.720 --> 04:38.500
 discuss the Made For program and the personal goals

04:38.500 --> 04:40.420
 and things that people are trying to achieve

04:40.420 --> 04:41.260
 with the program.

04:41.260 --> 04:44.340
 So it's a dialogue back and forth on Zoom call once a month.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.260
 Once again, that's getmadefor.com,

04:46.260 --> 04:47.700
 put in Huberman at checkout,

04:47.700 --> 04:49.660
 and you'll be able to get the 20% off

04:49.660 --> 04:52.940
 as well as access the monthly Zoom calls with us.

04:52.940 --> 04:55.520
 Let's talk about neuroplasticity.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.660
 More specifically, let's talk about

04:57.660 --> 05:00.860
 how we can optimize our brains.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.540
 Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature

05:03.540 --> 05:06.740
 of our nervous system that allows it to change itself

05:06.740 --> 05:10.300
 even in ways that we consciously decide.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.060
 Now that's an incredible property.

05:12.060 --> 05:14.860
 Our liver can't decide to just change itself.

05:14.860 --> 05:17.700
 Our spleen can't decide to just change itself

05:17.700 --> 05:19.080
 through conscious thought

05:19.080 --> 05:22.240
 or through feedback from another person.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.180
 The cells in those tissues can make changes, sure,

05:25.180 --> 05:26.860
 but it's our nervous system

05:26.860 --> 05:29.360
 that harbors this incredible ability

05:29.360 --> 05:34.360
 to direct its own changes in ways that we believe

05:34.860 --> 05:37.740
 or we're told will serve us better.

05:37.740 --> 05:39.460
 Now, today's a really special episode

05:39.460 --> 05:42.820
 because while we are going to talk about science,

05:42.820 --> 05:45.560
 and as always, we will delve into mechanism,

05:46.580 --> 05:49.020
 today's episode is really geared toward answering

05:49.020 --> 05:50.700
 your most common questions

05:50.700 --> 05:53.420
 about how to leverage neuroplasticity.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.880
 The previous episodes were about focus

05:55.880 --> 05:58.860
 and how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity

05:58.860 --> 06:00.180
 as well as the last episode,

06:00.180 --> 06:03.100
 which is what are some of the portals into plasticity

06:03.100 --> 06:04.200
 that relate to movement,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.560
 how behavior can activate plasticity

06:06.560 --> 06:10.060
 as well as how to activate plasticity for behavior itself,

06:10.060 --> 06:12.920
 how to get better at learning certain movements.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.140
 Today's podcast is really directed

06:15.140 --> 06:17.940
 toward answering your most common questions

06:17.940 --> 06:21.080
 and the bigger theme of how does one go about

06:21.080 --> 06:22.240
 optimizing their brain

06:22.240 --> 06:24.500
 or even think about optimizing the brain?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.860
 What is this thing that we're calling optimizing the brain?

06:27.860 --> 06:29.360
 In doing so, I'm also going to share

06:29.360 --> 06:32.600
 some of my typical routines and tools.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.140
 I don't share these because I think that they are

06:34.140 --> 06:35.860
 the only ones that are available out there.

06:35.860 --> 06:36.980
 Certainly they're not,

06:36.980 --> 06:38.700
 nor do I share them because I think that everyone

06:38.700 --> 06:42.000
 should do them just because I do them, certainly not.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.140
 I share them because many of you

06:44.140 --> 06:48.700
 have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when

06:48.700 --> 06:50.020
 and so I'll share those with you

06:50.020 --> 06:51.780
 and you can decide whether or not those protocols

06:51.780 --> 06:53.500
 are for you or not.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.780
 Everybody's different, but there are some common features

06:56.780 --> 06:58.980
 of how we are all put together

06:58.980 --> 07:01.220
 at the level of the nervous system and body

07:01.220 --> 07:04.220
 that direct us toward particular practices,

07:04.220 --> 07:07.020
 particular routines that can be especially powerful

07:07.020 --> 07:08.980
 for neuroplasticity.

07:08.980 --> 07:12.140
 So I want to open up the discussion today

07:12.140 --> 07:15.660
 by emphasizing something that's fundamentally important,

07:15.660 --> 07:19.300
 which is that plasticity is not the goal.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.700
 Plasticity is never the goal.

07:21.700 --> 07:25.660
 Plasticity is simply a state or a capacity

07:25.660 --> 07:27.620
 for our nervous system to change.

07:27.620 --> 07:30.900
 And so nothing makes me more frustrated perhaps

07:30.900 --> 07:34.300
 than when I hear, oh, you know, this pill, this potion,

07:34.300 --> 07:38.320
 this practice, it gives you plasticity.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.520
 Plasticity is just change.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.740
 The real question is, what are you trying to change?

07:42.740 --> 07:46.700
 And specifically, what end goal are you trying to achieve?

07:46.700 --> 07:50.500
 Specific end goals might be extremely specific,

07:50.500 --> 07:53.600
 like you want to learn how to speak a particular language

07:53.600 --> 07:55.840
 or you want to learn a new motor skill

07:55.840 --> 07:58.060
 or you want to get very good at calculus

07:58.060 --> 08:01.140
 or you'd like to forget the bad emotions related

08:01.140 --> 08:04.500
 to a particular human being or experience.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.740
 Or it can be more general,

08:05.740 --> 08:08.260
 like you'd like to be more creative.

08:08.260 --> 08:11.340
 We'll actually talk about creativity today.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.460
 Or you would like to achieve more focus

08:13.460 --> 08:15.240
 or you'd like to be less stressed.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.740
 So it's very important that you understand that plasticity

08:19.740 --> 08:23.660
 and achieving plasticity is the first step

08:23.660 --> 08:26.380
 in what we call optimizing your brain.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.560
 You don't want your brain to be plastic all the time.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.900
 In fact, one of the major questions,

08:30.900 --> 08:33.340
 one of the major unsolved mysteries of neuroscience

08:33.340 --> 08:36.260
 is how each and every one of us wakes up every day

08:36.260 --> 08:38.540
 and knows who we are.

08:38.540 --> 08:39.980
 Why should that be?

08:39.980 --> 08:41.700
 Well, the brain is plastic.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.060
 It has a capacity to change throughout the lifespan,

08:44.060 --> 08:47.820
 but it's not so plastic that every night when we go to sleep

08:47.820 --> 08:50.260
 or in our waking that the connections get reconfigured

08:50.260 --> 08:52.020
 so much so that we forget who we are

08:52.020 --> 08:53.800
 or how to walk or how to eat.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.560
 It's a good thing that we don't have such robust plasticity

08:58.560 --> 09:00.160
 or ongoing plasticity

09:00.160 --> 09:02.220
 that we have to restructure ourselves each day.

09:02.220 --> 09:04.460
 It's part of what gives our life continuity.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.300
 So remember, plasticity is not and is never the goal.

09:08.300 --> 09:12.520
 The goal is to figure out how to access plasticity

09:12.520 --> 09:16.840
 and then to direct that plasticity toward particular goals

09:16.840 --> 09:19.520
 or changes that you would like to achieve.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.400
 And I should just mention there's no rule that in life

09:23.400 --> 09:25.400
 you have to leverage this incredible thing

09:25.400 --> 09:26.560
 called neuroplasticity.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.120
 No one said you had to do that.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.400
 This podcast and this episode is particularly for people

09:31.400 --> 09:35.040
 who are either happy or unhappy with where they're at

09:35.040 --> 09:37.000
 with a particular aspect of their life

09:37.000 --> 09:39.800
 and they want to shift it in some positive way.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.940
 And many of you listening might say,

09:40.940 --> 09:42.360
 well, wouldn't everyone want to do that?

09:42.360 --> 09:44.240
 Well, actually there are a certain number of people

09:44.240 --> 09:45.440
 that are pretty good where they're at

09:45.440 --> 09:47.120
 and they don't want to change and that's terrific.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.960
 And I tip my hat to them and I think that's wonderful.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.840
 If ever they decide that they want to leverage

09:52.840 --> 09:54.280
 these plasticity mechanisms,

09:54.280 --> 09:57.080
 they can at any stage throughout the lifespan.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.760
 Let's start by talking about the different systems

10:01.760 --> 10:05.720
 within the nervous system that are available for plasticity.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.960
 And in doing so, I'll frame them in the context

10:07.960 --> 10:11.800
 of what I do on a daily basis, on a weekly basis

10:11.800 --> 10:13.320
 and on a yearly basis.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.680
 First of all, there are several forms of plasticity.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.200
 They have names like long-term potentiation,

10:21.200 --> 10:23.260
 long-term depression, which has nothing to do

10:23.260 --> 10:24.760
 with emotional depression, by the way,

10:24.760 --> 10:27.920
 and things like spike timing dependent plasticity.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.140
 Those names are used to describe cellular phenomenon,

10:32.140 --> 10:33.820
 the actual ways that the synapses,

10:33.820 --> 10:36.060
 the connections between neurons change.

10:36.060 --> 10:38.120
 I'll mention those things and I'll give a little more meat

10:38.120 --> 10:41.020
 as to what they are as I mentioned them.

10:41.020 --> 10:43.500
 But that's probably not the best way to think

10:43.500 --> 10:46.560
 about plasticity in terms of optimizing your brain.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.760
 The best way to think about it is in terms of short-term,

10:49.760 --> 10:53.320
 medium-term and long-term plasticity.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.380
 Short-term plasticity is any kind of shift

10:56.380 --> 11:00.480
 that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day,

11:00.480 --> 11:03.320
 but that you don't necessarily wanna hold on to forever.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.280
 And so what kinds of things are those?

11:05.280 --> 11:08.360
 Well, for instance, short-term plasticity might be

11:08.360 --> 11:11.860
 you wake up earlier than you would like to catch a flight.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.420
 You're not feeling particularly alert

11:14.420 --> 11:16.920
 and you want to use a protocol

11:16.920 --> 11:18.500
 or you decide to use a protocol,

11:18.500 --> 11:20.760
 which could be coffee or it could be a certain form

11:20.760 --> 11:22.640
 of breathing or it could be some other tool

11:22.640 --> 11:24.240
 to become more alert at a time of day

11:24.240 --> 11:26.040
 when normally you aren't that alert.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.600
 But your expectation is that when you return home,

11:29.600 --> 11:33.280
 you will discard with the need to do that at 5.30 AM

11:33.280 --> 11:35.000
 because you'll be asleep at 5.30 AM.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.280
 So there's short-term plasticity, behavioral plasticity.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.160
 Then there's medium-term plasticity,

11:40.160 --> 11:42.200
 which are changes that you might wanna make.

11:42.200 --> 11:47.000
 I call this with respect and a little bit of humor,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.240
 or at least my kind of humor.

11:48.240 --> 11:53.240
 I call this the undergraduate pre-med phenomenon.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.840
 For those of you that have worked with pre-meds

11:55.840 --> 11:56.960
 and have tremendous respect

11:56.960 --> 11:59.240
 for medical students and pre-meds,

11:59.240 --> 12:02.140
 there is a kind of a stereotype,

12:02.140 --> 12:04.600
 which I don't necessarily agree with.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.420
 But the stereotype is that they wanna know

12:06.420 --> 12:08.060
 what they need to know for sake of the exam,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.080
 but they don't really wanna know.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.280
 They just want the A.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.680
 And I don't think that's always true.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.720
 I've worked with a number of different pre-meds

12:13.720 --> 12:16.000
 over the years and there are many of them

12:16.000 --> 12:20.900
 that are absolutely passionate about the knowledge itself.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.440
 And they also wanted the A.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.840
 But the pre-med phenomenon,

12:23.840 --> 12:25.980
 as it's discussed among professors and TAs,

12:25.980 --> 12:28.280
 is that you've got these students,

12:28.280 --> 12:29.700
 they just wanna know what they need to know

12:29.700 --> 12:31.040
 so they can get the A, right?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.480
 It's medium-term plasticity.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.880
 They don't actually want it to be embedded

12:33.880 --> 12:35.360
 in their memory too long

12:35.360 --> 12:37.240
 or else they would actually care about the information.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.400
 So that's medium-term information.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.140
 And sometimes that's useful, for instance,

12:41.140 --> 12:43.640
 if you go on vacation to Costa Rica

12:43.640 --> 12:45.640
 and you don't know your way around Costa Rica,

12:45.640 --> 12:48.020
 you wanna learn the different town and the routes there,

12:48.020 --> 12:50.040
 but you don't have any intention of going back.

12:50.040 --> 12:50.920
 It's just medium-term.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.160
 You wanna just program it in for sake of your time there

12:53.160 --> 12:54.780
 and then you wanna discard it.

12:54.780 --> 12:56.360
 Most of the time when we think about

12:56.360 --> 12:57.740
 or talk about optimizing the brain,

12:57.740 --> 13:00.120
 we're talking about long-term plasticity.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.840
 We're talking about the kinds of changes

13:01.840 --> 13:02.680
 that people wanna make

13:02.680 --> 13:06.640
 so that their brain reflexively works differently.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.880
 This is what a child does

13:07.880 --> 13:09.720
 when it goes from not knowing how to walk

13:09.720 --> 13:10.720
 to knowing how to walk.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.080
 It doesn't have to think about it

13:12.080 --> 13:15.200
 after it learns how to walk, it becomes reflexive.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.500
 Long-term plasticity is almost always the big goal.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.280
 It's I wanna know how to speak that language.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.060
 I wanna be able to do that skill.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.720
 I wanna be able to feel this way

13:24.720 --> 13:26.920
 without having to put much work into it.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.280
 And there are tools and protocols

13:28.280 --> 13:29.600
 that one can do to achieve that.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.080
 And we are going to talk about those.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.020
 We've talked about a few of them in previous episodes,

13:33.020 --> 13:35.380
 but I will revisit those protocols today.

13:37.020 --> 13:41.080
 I'm gonna frame all this in the context of the daily life,

13:41.080 --> 13:44.680
 the weekly life, and the yearly life.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.080
 And that's because neural plasticity

13:47.080 --> 13:49.080
 and optimizing your brain

13:50.040 --> 13:53.460
 rides on a deeper foundation

13:53.460 --> 13:56.680
 of this thing that governs plasticity

13:56.680 --> 14:00.080
 and in fact governs all our life called autonomic arousal,

14:00.080 --> 14:02.680
 which is that we're asleep for part of the 24 hour cycle

14:02.680 --> 14:04.360
 and we are awake almost always.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.700
 If we push ourselves and stay awake, we're okay.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.160
 We can do that for a night or two,

14:08.160 --> 14:10.400
 but almost always we are asleep for a portion of it

14:10.400 --> 14:12.300
 and we are awake for a portion of it.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.820
 I've said it before, but I'll say it again.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.660
 The trigger for plasticity and learning

14:16.660 --> 14:19.780
 occurs during high focus, high alertness states,

14:19.780 --> 14:21.580
 not while you're asleep.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.620
 And the focus and alertness are both key

14:23.620 --> 14:26.660
 because of the neurochemicals associated with those states.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.160
 But the actual rewiring

14:29.160 --> 14:31.540
 and the reconfiguration of the brain connections

14:31.540 --> 14:33.640
 happens during non-sleep deep rest,

14:33.640 --> 14:37.880
 which we'll talk more about as always, and deep sleep.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.140
 So you trigger the change and in sleep, you get the change.

14:41.140 --> 14:44.220
 So some of the things that we'll talk about today

14:44.220 --> 14:47.920
 about optimizing the brain are centered around not sleep,

14:47.920 --> 14:50.600
 but around the autonomic arousal system.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.280
 We have this system of neurons in our brain and body

14:53.280 --> 14:57.860
 that's just incredible that wake us up and make us alert.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.580
 And when we're not accessing that system well,

15:00.580 --> 15:04.220
 we cannot access plasticity, we cannot optimize our brain.

15:04.220 --> 15:08.180
 Likewise, if we cannot sleep well and we can't rest well,

15:08.180 --> 15:11.780
 we will not access plasticity and rewire our brain

15:11.780 --> 15:13.660
 because that's when the actual configuration

15:13.660 --> 15:15.520
 between the connections occurs.

15:15.520 --> 15:20.260
 So to set this in context, I wake up each day

15:20.260 --> 15:22.940
 and I'll be totally honest,

15:22.940 --> 15:26.120
 I usually don't feel like bouncing right out of bed.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.820
 I usually don't feel completely rested.

15:28.820 --> 15:31.040
 And that's not because I don't get enough sleep.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.080
 It's probably because I'm not terrific

15:33.080 --> 15:35.340
 about timing my sleep so well.

15:35.340 --> 15:36.840
 Now this month isn't about sleep,

15:36.840 --> 15:37.840
 that was the previous month,

15:37.840 --> 15:39.980
 but I really wanna emphasize a few points.

15:41.120 --> 15:46.020
 I wake up generally more tired and groggy than I would like

15:46.020 --> 15:48.340
 because I tend to go to sleep too late.

15:48.340 --> 15:49.940
 It's just something that I do.

15:49.940 --> 15:52.940
 I tend to get up early either because I set an alarm,

15:52.940 --> 15:54.300
 because I have things to do,

15:54.300 --> 15:56.140
 or because I naturally wake up early

15:56.140 --> 15:58.740
 because of the light coming in and so forth.

15:58.740 --> 16:02.260
 Well, what that tells me is that I'm probably somebody

16:02.260 --> 16:05.100
 who's natural circadian rhythm.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.340
 You may have heard of chronotypes.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.020
 These are genetically programmed things,

16:08.020 --> 16:10.620
 but chronotype is shorter than 24 hours.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.920
 It means that the cycle of waking and alertness for me

16:12.920 --> 16:15.780
 is probably shorter than 24 hours,

16:15.780 --> 16:18.460
 which means that getting some light in the late afternoon

16:18.460 --> 16:21.860
 will help me shift and make my cycle a little bit longer.

16:21.860 --> 16:22.980
 It will phase delay me.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.020
 If that doesn't make any sense, see a previous episode.

16:25.020 --> 16:25.860
 But what it really means

16:25.860 --> 16:27.340
 is getting some light in the afternoon

16:27.340 --> 16:29.820
 will allow me to stay up a little bit later.

16:29.820 --> 16:33.780
 But what it means is that I'm not really matching

16:33.780 --> 16:38.420
 my hardwired needs of going to bed

16:38.420 --> 16:41.980
 probably at 8.30 or nine and waking up at 4 a.m.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.180
 I tend to go to sleep around 10.30, 11,

16:44.180 --> 16:46.940
 lately around 11.30 or 12, and then I wake up at six,

16:46.940 --> 16:48.740
 and so of course I'm going to feel groggy.

16:48.740 --> 16:52.900
 So neuroplasticity will allow me to optimize my wakefulness,

16:52.900 --> 16:56.060
 but I have to do something in order to access that.

16:56.060 --> 16:58.100
 And some of you may already be anticipating

16:58.100 --> 16:59.800
 what I'm about to say, which is, oh no,

16:59.800 --> 17:01.700
 he's going to tell us to get sunlight in our eyes

17:01.700 --> 17:03.420
 in the first 30 minutes of the day.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.620
 I am going to tell you to do that,

17:04.620 --> 17:06.420
 but I'm going to also tell you two things

17:06.420 --> 17:08.780
 that I have not discussed before,

17:08.780 --> 17:11.220
 which relate to the plasticity

17:11.220 --> 17:14.660
 between the melanopsin cells, these sunlight detecting,

17:14.660 --> 17:16.380
 bright light detecting cells in our eye,

17:16.380 --> 17:18.180
 and the circadian clock.

17:18.180 --> 17:19.900
 I've never said this before in this podcast,

17:19.900 --> 17:21.720
 but it turns out that the connections

17:21.720 --> 17:24.860
 between these melanopsin cells and the circadian clock

17:24.860 --> 17:27.620
 are plastic throughout the lifespan.

17:27.620 --> 17:30.260
 There's a massive configuration of the connections there

17:30.260 --> 17:32.040
 and a cell type called the astrocytes,

17:32.040 --> 17:35.460
 which are a glial cell, are actively removing

17:35.460 --> 17:37.100
 and reinforcing connections

17:37.100 --> 17:40.440
 between the eye and that clock every day.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.820
 Now, this is incredible because other aspects of your brain

17:42.820 --> 17:46.920
 that, for instance, represent you knowing who you are

17:46.920 --> 17:49.540
 when you wake up in the morning or what your name is,

17:49.540 --> 17:50.420
 assuming that you're old enough

17:50.420 --> 17:52.140
 that you've already learned your name.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.660
 One of the first things kids learn

17:53.660 --> 17:55.500
 is something we rarely ever forget.

17:56.980 --> 18:00.280
 Those connections are changing all the time

18:00.280 --> 18:01.460
 every 24 hour cycle.

18:01.460 --> 18:04.220
 So there's an opportunity for short-term plasticity.

18:04.220 --> 18:05.980
 So that's why I view sunlight first thing in the day,

18:05.980 --> 18:07.340
 it helps me wake up.

18:07.340 --> 18:10.580
 The other thing that I do is that there's a circuit

18:10.580 --> 18:13.500
 that exists between the circadian clock and our adrenals

18:13.500 --> 18:14.700
 that I've talked about before

18:14.700 --> 18:16.420
 that triggers the release of cortisol

18:16.420 --> 18:18.600
 first thing in the morning that wakes us up,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.400
 especially when we view light.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.720
 So if you're groggy in the morning,

18:21.720 --> 18:23.800
 that's why viewing light is helpful.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.100
 But the interesting thing is if you start viewing light

18:27.100 --> 18:28.780
 frequently in the morning,

18:28.780 --> 18:31.980
 then those connections between the melanopsin cells

18:31.980 --> 18:36.340
 and the circadian clock become primed or potentiated,

18:36.340 --> 18:38.020
 we would say, they become stronger

18:38.020 --> 18:39.780
 for the anticipation of light.

18:39.780 --> 18:42.000
 And you naturally start waking up earlier,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.460
 feeling more alert.

18:43.460 --> 18:46.020
 So what this says is, and what I do

18:46.020 --> 18:47.380
 is I get that regular light

18:47.380 --> 18:48.780
 because I know that some mornings

18:48.780 --> 18:50.260
 I'm just not going to feel very alert,

18:50.260 --> 18:51.940
 I'll feel especially tired.

18:51.940 --> 18:53.700
 And I might not be able to access sunlight

18:53.700 --> 18:55.460
 because it's really overcast or I'm traveling

18:55.460 --> 18:57.580
 or some other feature, but the system is plastic

18:57.580 --> 18:59.900
 so it's shifted in the right direction.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.380
 Now it will shift back

19:01.380 --> 19:02.740
 because it's short-term plasticity

19:02.740 --> 19:03.880
 after about two, three days.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.580
 So you wanna try and get the sunlight exposure

19:05.580 --> 19:07.060
 on a regular basis.

19:07.060 --> 19:11.060
 The other thing that I do is I delay my intake of caffeine

19:11.060 --> 19:12.980
 for the first two hours that I'm awake.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.820
 Now, this can be very painful for people,

19:15.820 --> 19:19.360
 but earlier we talked about the adenosine system

19:19.360 --> 19:22.700
 and how the accumulation of adenosine makes us sleepy

19:22.700 --> 19:27.540
 and caffeine suppresses adenosine, it makes us feel alert.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.740
 But we know that if you ingest caffeine

19:30.740 --> 19:32.620
 immediately on waking,

19:32.620 --> 19:35.740
 the signal to the adrenals to release cortisol,

19:35.740 --> 19:38.060
 which is a healthy release of cortisol

19:38.060 --> 19:40.060
 and the suppression of adenosine

19:40.060 --> 19:43.060
 that happens as we come out of sleep

19:44.100 --> 19:46.180
 and in deep sleep, the suppression of adenosine.

19:46.180 --> 19:48.380
 If you ingest caffeine too early,

19:48.380 --> 19:50.640
 there's a mechanism by which the adenosine

19:50.640 --> 19:53.060
 competes for the receptors, et cetera,

19:53.060 --> 19:55.780
 so that you have a mid-morning crash.

19:55.780 --> 19:59.220
 Because if caffeine, the way it works is if caffeine

19:59.220 --> 20:01.340
 is occupying the adenosine receptor,

20:01.340 --> 20:04.680
 then the natural endogenous mechanisms

20:04.680 --> 20:06.740
 for suppressing adenosine

20:06.740 --> 20:08.860
 are not actually gonna have their actions.

20:08.860 --> 20:13.620
 So the brain to adrenal axis is subject to plasticity also.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.280
 And so by delaying caffeine

20:15.280 --> 20:17.580
 until about two hours after waking,

20:17.580 --> 20:21.340
 I'm able to capture and reinforce to potentiate

20:21.340 --> 20:24.100
 the neural circuit that exists between the circadian clock

20:24.100 --> 20:26.260
 and the cortisol release in the adrenals,

20:26.260 --> 20:30.660
 as well as leave those adenosine receptors unoccupied

20:30.660 --> 20:34.600
 so that I can then use the caffeine to get a natural lift

20:34.600 --> 20:36.740
 in alertness and focus two hours later,

20:36.740 --> 20:39.940
 as opposed to using it just to wake myself up

20:39.940 --> 20:41.380
 out of sleepiness.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.860
 So while I'm sure there are some eye rolls out there

20:43.860 --> 20:45.380
 and some yawns about,

20:45.380 --> 20:47.580
 oh no, it's the sunlight in the morning thing again,

20:47.580 --> 20:50.780
 it's a powerful tool for readjusting these circuits,

20:50.780 --> 20:52.340
 so the short-term plasticity.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.180
 And the reason for delaying caffeine

20:54.180 --> 20:55.460
 for the first two hours of the day,

20:55.460 --> 20:58.020
 even if it's painful to do for the first couple of days

20:58.020 --> 21:01.380
 is that then you naturally start to wake up

21:01.380 --> 21:03.760
 more readily in the morning without caffeine

21:03.760 --> 21:06.860
 because the adenosine is suppressed

21:06.860 --> 21:09.400
 and you don't have these competing,

21:09.400 --> 21:11.700
 it's called a competing antagonist

21:11.700 --> 21:15.040
 for the adenosine receptor.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.480
 So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.060
 Lately, because I wake up very early,

21:19.060 --> 21:23.540
 I do use a bright light to stimulate alertness.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.300
 It's not actually designed for that purpose.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.700
 It's just a light board that has about 900 lux.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.180
 And then I delay caffeine.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.820
 Some of you have asked,

21:31.820 --> 21:34.780
 and again, I'm not saying that anyone has to do this,

21:34.780 --> 21:35.980
 what exactly do you drink?

21:35.980 --> 21:37.940
 I'm a big believer in black coffee.

21:37.940 --> 21:39.500
 I just happen to like black coffee.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.740
 People have asked me about,

21:40.740 --> 21:42.140
 and I don't wanna name brand names here

21:42.140 --> 21:45.620
 about this type of coffee or that type of coffee

21:45.620 --> 21:48.100
 mixed with these other kinds of things.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.960
 Will that increase focus?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.900
 You know, I'm gonna talk today a lot

21:51.900 --> 21:55.260
 about the use of diet and fasting and timing of foods

21:55.260 --> 21:56.580
 and certain kinds of foods.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.560
 But to be honest, black coffee is just a simple choice

21:59.560 --> 22:00.880
 that's always worked for me.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.180
 I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.260
 There's plenty of data now showing

22:05.260 --> 22:08.480
 that even a slight increase in dehydration,

22:08.480 --> 22:10.340
 meaning just when you're lacking water,

22:10.340 --> 22:12.260
 can make people have headaches.

22:12.260 --> 22:14.720
 It can provide some additional photophobia.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.820
 For those of you that are migraine prone,

22:16.820 --> 22:18.400
 bright light can trigger migraines.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.640
 That's no surprise to those of you

22:19.640 --> 22:20.820
 that get headaches and migraines.

22:20.820 --> 22:25.260
 But dehydration can compound the vulnerability

22:25.260 --> 22:26.320
 to migraine and headache.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.940
 So I drink water, I drink black coffee, or I drink mate,

22:28.940 --> 22:31.420
 which is just because I have Argentine lineage,

22:31.420 --> 22:33.780
 which is just a high caffeine drink

22:33.780 --> 22:34.620
 first thing in the morning.

22:34.620 --> 22:38.060
 But I delay it until two hours after I wake up.

22:38.060 --> 22:41.140
 And that's because I want the circuits

22:41.140 --> 22:44.700
 between my eye and my circadian clock and my adrenals

22:44.700 --> 22:46.840
 to be functioning in a particular way

22:46.840 --> 22:49.220
 so that then later the caffeine is an addition,

22:49.220 --> 22:50.960
 it adds more alertness.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.280
 Now, this is a discussion about how to optimize your brain.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.540
 Many people who wake up quickly

22:56.540 --> 22:59.100
 and just naturally feel like bouncing out of bed,

22:59.100 --> 23:00.920
 I envy these people,

23:00.920 --> 23:05.060
 they will do just fine by going into a learning bout

23:05.060 --> 23:07.180
 or taking care of whatever it is

23:07.180 --> 23:08.140
 that they need to take care of.

23:08.140 --> 23:10.380
 Sometimes that's kind of more mundane tasks

23:10.380 --> 23:12.980
 like email and whatnot.

23:12.980 --> 23:15.580
 Here's a more or less a rule

23:15.580 --> 23:17.520
 about how the brain functions

23:17.520 --> 23:20.860
 vis-a-vis focus, learning, and creativity.

23:20.860 --> 23:24.580
 And I'm gonna discuss this much more in future episodes.

23:24.580 --> 23:27.260
 Generally, states of high alertness,

23:27.260 --> 23:29.060
 when we're very, very alert,

23:29.060 --> 23:32.360
 are great for strategy implementation.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.780
 When we already know how to do something

23:34.780 --> 23:38.380
 and it's just simply a matter of plugging

23:38.380 --> 23:41.120
 the correct elements into the correct boxes.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.900
 Things I've talked before about duration, path, and outcome

23:44.900 --> 23:47.740
 as the three things that the deliberate conscious brain

23:47.740 --> 23:51.020
 is trying to figure out in order to perform certain tasks,

23:51.020 --> 23:52.900
 even cognitive tasks.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.100
 This is the sort of thing that we are very good at

23:56.100 --> 23:58.720
 when we're well-rested and we're focused

23:58.720 --> 24:01.460
 and our autonomic arousal or our alertness rather

24:01.460 --> 24:03.420
 as it is at a high level.

24:03.420 --> 24:06.420
 If you are somebody who is hitting that alertness

24:06.420 --> 24:09.580
 phase of your day very early, right after you wake up,

24:09.580 --> 24:12.180
 that's a great time to move right into things

24:12.180 --> 24:14.760
 that at least the research says,

24:14.760 --> 24:16.660
 you already know have the strategy

24:16.660 --> 24:19.100
 and you just wanna implement the strategy.

24:19.100 --> 24:21.820
 This is where I fundamentally depart from the idea that,

24:21.820 --> 24:23.420
 oh, you have to do the hardest

24:23.420 --> 24:24.940
 or most critical tasks throughout the day.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.260
 Sometimes the hardest and most critical tasks

24:27.260 --> 24:29.480
 are tasks that require creativity.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.600
 And as we'll soon talk about,

24:31.600 --> 24:35.040
 creativity and tasks related to it,

24:35.040 --> 24:38.260
 oftentimes come to us best

24:38.260 --> 24:40.220
 or the brain is best at achieving those

24:40.220 --> 24:44.380
 when we're in states of calm or even slightly drowsy,

24:44.380 --> 24:47.060
 which is something that's interesting and we'll get into.

24:47.060 --> 24:48.460
 But for me, for instance,

24:48.460 --> 24:51.220
 I get up, I'm not terribly alert first thing.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.380
 And so I try and just get my brain

24:53.380 --> 24:54.900
 and my thoughts organized.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.960
 It's not a time for me to be responding

24:56.960 --> 24:58.980
 in a very linear fashion to emails

24:58.980 --> 25:01.020
 or carrying out calculations.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.580
 That comes about two hours later.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.740
 And I think many people out there will relate,

25:04.740 --> 25:06.700
 mid morning is when we tend to,

25:06.700 --> 25:08.640
 when many people tend to achieve their peak

25:08.640 --> 25:10.440
 in alertness and focus.

25:10.440 --> 25:15.020
 Now, many times I get the question and this is,

25:15.020 --> 25:16.740
 what I'm about to say is directly related

25:16.740 --> 25:19.780
 to the hundreds of questions I got about this.

25:19.780 --> 25:23.080
 Should I use background music in order to learn?

25:23.080 --> 25:26.300
 Should I have construction next door?

25:26.300 --> 25:27.820
 Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

25:27.820 --> 25:30.260
 Is it better to be in complete silence, et cetera?

25:30.260 --> 25:31.180
 Now this will vary.

25:31.180 --> 25:33.460
 Some people can tolerate their own noise

25:33.460 --> 25:34.980
 within their head much better than others.

25:34.980 --> 25:37.540
 Other people find that having some background noise

25:37.540 --> 25:39.860
 helps cancel that out.

25:39.860 --> 25:42.700
 But there's a simple rule of thumb that one can use

25:42.700 --> 25:45.860
 because at least my experience is that sometimes

25:45.860 --> 25:48.540
 background music, background noise is very helpful

25:48.540 --> 25:50.140
 for allowing me to focus.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.700
 And other times it's very distracting.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.820
 So what actually governs that?

25:54.820 --> 25:57.220
 Well, we have to ask ourselves,

25:57.220 --> 26:01.500
 what is at the source of the lack of focus?

26:01.500 --> 26:04.620
 If our lack of focus is because our autonomic arousal,

26:04.620 --> 26:06.540
 our alertness is very, very high.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.400
 We had a little too much coffee or if there is such a thing,

26:09.400 --> 26:11.440
 slept a little too long or we're really stressed

26:11.440 --> 26:15.260
 or really activated and we can't seem to focus.

26:15.260 --> 26:18.900
 In that case, eliminating background noise

26:18.900 --> 26:21.160
 and really just trying to get silence

26:21.160 --> 26:25.020
 so that we can quiet some of that autonomic arousal

26:25.020 --> 26:29.420
 is going to be best for learning and for implementation

26:29.420 --> 26:31.340
 of things we already know how to do

26:31.340 --> 26:33.920
 for any kind of focus linear task,

26:33.920 --> 26:36.840
 which basically learning is a focus linear task

26:36.840 --> 26:38.980
 is that you're just not necessarily performing it well

26:38.980 --> 26:39.820
 all the time.

26:39.820 --> 26:41.160
 Last time we talked about making errors.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.620
 So as a rule of thumb, if you're feeling too keyed up,

26:44.620 --> 26:47.440
 then silence and quiet is going to be helpful.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.220
 In fact, if you're very keyed up,

26:50.080 --> 26:53.720
 a particular circuit related to the basal ganglia

26:53.720 --> 26:55.720
 starts getting triggered more easily.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.660
 And this circuit I'm going to talk about in depth,

26:57.660 --> 27:00.400
 but it's called the go, no go circuit.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.780
 We have circuits that connect our forebrain

27:02.780 --> 27:05.220
 to our structure in our brain called the basal ganglia,

27:05.220 --> 27:07.280
 which is actually a collection of structures.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.800
 And the forebrain, which is involved in rational thought

27:10.800 --> 27:12.280
 and thinking and planning and action

27:12.280 --> 27:15.060
 is always trying to plan what should I do

27:15.060 --> 27:16.540
 and then implement that action.

27:16.540 --> 27:18.860
 And the basal ganglia are intimately involved

27:18.860 --> 27:19.700
 in that discussion.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.240
 There's a reciprocal loop of communication

27:22.240 --> 27:24.400
 between basal ganglia and cortex.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.180
 The basal ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex

27:28.180 --> 27:30.280
 and the cortex back to the basal ganglia

27:30.280 --> 27:35.200
 that facilitates go, it facilitates action.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.920
 And the molecule, the neuromodulator dopamine

27:38.820 --> 27:40.820
 triggers the activation of go.

27:40.820 --> 27:43.320
 It tends to make us want to do more things.

27:43.320 --> 27:46.420
 It tends to make us bias toward action

27:46.420 --> 27:48.320
 by the way that dopamine binds

27:48.320 --> 27:50.020
 to something called the D1 receptors,

27:50.020 --> 27:52.120
 just a particular type of dopamine receptor

27:52.120 --> 27:54.400
 for those of you that want to know.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.600
 The no go pathway, the pathway in the basal ganglia

27:58.600 --> 28:00.940
 and cortex that suppresses action

28:02.080 --> 28:04.920
 involves dopamine binding to this other receptor

28:04.920 --> 28:06.840
 called the D2 receptor.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.580
 Now D1, D2 receptors, you can't just consciously decide,

28:09.580 --> 28:11.200
 oh, I only want my D1 receptors

28:11.200 --> 28:13.520
 and my D2 receptors to be active.

28:13.520 --> 28:18.440
 You have to think about which sorts of states of mind

28:18.440 --> 28:23.440
 and body facilitate go and which ones facilitate no go.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.560
 Now this is critically important

28:26.560 --> 28:29.920
 because doing focused work, accessing plasticity

28:29.920 --> 28:33.540
 and learning involve doing certain things

28:33.540 --> 28:35.700
 and not doing others.

28:35.700 --> 28:36.680
 So here's how it works

28:36.680 --> 28:39.220
 and here's how I apply it on a daily basis.

28:40.320 --> 28:44.360
 Because I tend to be most alert first thing mid morning

28:44.360 --> 28:47.720
 or so and then I generally will have my caffeine mid morning

28:47.720 --> 28:52.520
 my peak of alertness in the early part of the day

28:52.520 --> 28:55.620
 is occurring for me sometime between 9.30 and 11 a.m.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.680
 That's just me, other people might experience that

28:57.680 --> 28:59.160
 immediately after rolling out of bed,

28:59.160 --> 29:01.440
 they might be wide awake and ready to go.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.800
 Which case they should be cautious

29:02.800 --> 29:04.180
 about throwing caffeine into the mix

29:04.180 --> 29:06.960
 because then it's gonna make them very, very alert.

29:06.960 --> 29:11.560
 There are three sort of levels of autonomic arousal

29:11.560 --> 29:16.560
 of alertness that bias us more toward go, no go or both.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.880
 And this relates to a question that I've gotten now

29:21.880 --> 29:23.960
 hundreds of times from you

29:23.960 --> 29:26.420
 in the comment section for this podcast,

29:26.420 --> 29:29.400
 which is, is it better for me to listen to music

29:29.400 --> 29:31.840
 in the background while I work and learn

29:31.840 --> 29:34.400
 or should I have complete silence?

29:34.400 --> 29:37.280
 And the answer is it depends

29:37.280 --> 29:40.160
 but it doesn't depend randomly on who you are

29:40.160 --> 29:42.280
 or even necessarily time of day.

29:42.280 --> 29:47.160
 It depends on your overall level of autonomic arousal

29:47.160 --> 29:50.080
 and it depends because autonomic arousal,

29:50.080 --> 29:53.000
 level of alertness biases the extent to which

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
 we are more prone to goes, to action or to no goes,

29:58.480 --> 30:00.280
 to suppress action.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.880
 And dopamine is this molecule that's swimming around

30:02.880 --> 30:05.120
 and it's going to bias one or the other responses.

30:05.120 --> 30:05.960
 So here's how it works.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.760
 Let's say I'm very alert.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.400
 Maybe I got a particularly good night's sleep

30:09.400 --> 30:12.300
 the night before, I had a little too much coffee

30:12.300 --> 30:14.720
 and I'm gonna sit down to some work.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.500
 The thing to know and what I always tell myself

30:17.500 --> 30:22.500
 is when I'm very alert, I am very prone to go to action

30:22.500 --> 30:27.500
 but I'm also prone to not no go, right?

30:27.940 --> 30:30.460
 I'm not gonna be very good at suppressing action.

30:30.460 --> 30:31.600
 So those are two different things,

30:31.600 --> 30:32.780
 being biased toward action

30:32.780 --> 30:35.100
 and being biased towards suppressing action

30:35.100 --> 30:37.520
 are two different things, okay?

30:37.520 --> 30:41.940
 So those are push-pull, toward action, suppress action.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.620
 So when you're very alert,

30:43.620 --> 30:46.340
 the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.740
 This is why when people say, well,

30:47.740 --> 30:50.580
 should I just take a drug like that will increase

30:50.580 --> 30:52.180
 my level of epinephrine and alertness,

30:52.180 --> 30:53.180
 will that help me learn better?

30:53.180 --> 30:55.700
 No, because it will make you do things

30:55.700 --> 30:57.620
 but it will also make you less good

30:57.620 --> 31:00.720
 at suppressing actions that you need to suppress.

31:00.720 --> 31:04.120
 So if I'm very alert, particularly alert for me

31:04.120 --> 31:06.340
 and I recognize what that state is of course

31:06.340 --> 31:08.940
 cause everyone will be different, I know what it is for me.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.620
 Then I want silence for learning.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.940
 I want it shut down my internet, which I do.

31:13.940 --> 31:17.660
 I sometimes use a program that I believe is a free program

31:17.660 --> 31:21.460
 called Freedom where it actually locks you out

31:21.460 --> 31:23.340
 of the internet for a particular time.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.540
 They're not a sponsor of the podcast,

31:24.540 --> 31:26.540
 I just happen to use it.

31:26.540 --> 31:27.800
 There's another version of Freedom

31:27.800 --> 31:30.440
 where you go to the wireless thing and you turn it off,

31:30.440 --> 31:32.380
 you disconnect from the wireless, that's the other one.

31:32.380 --> 31:36.140
 Although many people have a hard time not reactivating it.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.340
 So I'm trying to shut down the go pathway

31:39.340 --> 31:41.380
 towards distraction.

31:41.380 --> 31:43.040
 And the other thing that I'll do

31:43.040 --> 31:45.180
 is I'll generally turn off my phone,

31:45.180 --> 31:46.620
 put the phone outside in the car

31:46.620 --> 31:49.460
 or in really extreme cases, I'll throw it up on the roof

31:49.460 --> 31:51.340
 which is hard for me to retrieve.

31:51.340 --> 31:52.560
 So that I can't get to it.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.000
 So if I'm very alert,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.980
 I'm aware that I will have a bias toward action.

31:57.980 --> 32:00.620
 It will be hard for me to suppress non-action

32:00.620 --> 32:03.280
 but that it's very non-specific

32:03.280 --> 32:06.920
 because the next kind of level down of alertness

32:06.920 --> 32:10.160
 or autonomic arousal is clear, calm and focused

32:10.160 --> 32:12.460
 where we have that kind of sweet spot

32:12.460 --> 32:16.620
 between our willingness to pursue action.

32:16.620 --> 32:19.100
 We're in a mode of go and it's not always physical action

32:19.100 --> 32:21.980
 but it can be pursuing hard bouts of learning

32:21.980 --> 32:26.380
 but that our ability to suppress is also very good.

32:26.380 --> 32:27.340
 And this is because,

32:27.340 --> 32:29.120
 and I don't want to get into too many details

32:29.120 --> 32:31.260
 because of the way that dopamine competes

32:31.260 --> 32:33.580
 for these dopamine one receptors in the go pathway

32:33.580 --> 32:36.020
 and dopamine two receptors in the no-go pathway.

32:37.260 --> 32:39.080
 They're always in this kind of push pull.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.500
 And so there is a sweet spot

32:40.500 --> 32:42.500
 and that sweet spot isn't flow

32:42.500 --> 32:44.180
 where it is in some sort of state

32:44.180 --> 32:46.180
 where all of a sudden things come naturally to us.

32:46.180 --> 32:47.660
 The state that we're trying to achieve

32:47.660 --> 32:49.860
 that's optimal for learning is one in which

32:49.860 --> 32:52.180
 we have the energy and focus to pursue

32:52.180 --> 32:55.340
 but we also have the energy and focus to suppress action.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.020
 So the basal ganglia are kind of working

32:57.020 --> 33:00.100
 in a perfect kind of sing songy manner

33:00.100 --> 33:01.860
 through this parallel pathway.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.180
 Now, as we get tired or as we round out

33:04.180 --> 33:06.700
 an ultradian cycle of about 90 minutes,

33:07.640 --> 33:09.400
 what happens is our fatigue,

33:09.400 --> 33:10.800
 even if it's not a physical fatigue

33:10.800 --> 33:12.420
 that makes us want to go to sleep

33:12.420 --> 33:14.600
 but our mental fatigue starts to accumulate

33:14.600 --> 33:17.140
 because these pathways of go, no-go

33:17.140 --> 33:20.100
 are actually very metabolically consuming.

33:20.100 --> 33:23.820
 So what I recognize is that as I start to falter,

33:23.820 --> 33:26.860
 I have a harder time engaging and going.

33:26.860 --> 33:30.300
 I also know, or going toward the goal rather.

33:30.300 --> 33:35.300
 I also know that my reflex toward actions

33:35.340 --> 33:36.700
 that are unrelated to the learning

33:36.700 --> 33:38.080
 are also going to start increasing

33:38.080 --> 33:42.820
 because I'm not going to be able to suppress action

33:42.820 --> 33:44.380
 and activate the no-go pathway.

33:44.380 --> 33:45.920
 So if this all sounds like a mouthful,

33:45.920 --> 33:47.420
 let's make it very simple for you.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.180
 When you are very alert,

33:49.180 --> 33:52.740
 the best situation for learning is going to be silence.

33:52.740 --> 33:55.140
 It's going to be complete quiet.

33:55.140 --> 33:58.020
 If you are low arousal and you're tired

33:58.020 --> 33:59.220
 and you're kind of sleepy,

33:59.220 --> 34:02.060
 a lot of people find that having some background chatter

34:02.060 --> 34:03.740
 and some background noise

34:03.740 --> 34:06.260
 can help elevate their level of autonomic arousal.

34:06.260 --> 34:08.300
 And that's because our auditory system

34:08.300 --> 34:10.260
 and our visual system are linked

34:10.260 --> 34:13.140
 and are part of really what's called the salience network,

34:13.140 --> 34:14.360
 which is that we're always scanning

34:14.360 --> 34:15.860
 our environment for things.

34:15.860 --> 34:19.220
 And when we have a lot of things in our environment to scan,

34:19.220 --> 34:21.700
 generally our level of alertness goes up.

34:21.700 --> 34:24.740
 This is why environments that are very stark

34:24.740 --> 34:27.880
 or have very little or very few objects in them

34:27.880 --> 34:29.700
 tend to make us feel kind of calm

34:29.700 --> 34:31.940
 because our salience network kind of shuts off.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.080
 A lot of people don't like that.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.380
 They'll go to a meditation retreat

34:35.380 --> 34:36.860
 or they'll go into an environment

34:36.860 --> 34:39.220
 where there's very little clutter, especially city people.

34:39.220 --> 34:40.900
 And all of a sudden they start feeling

34:40.900 --> 34:42.300
 really, really anxious.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.140
 And that's because their internal level

34:44.140 --> 34:45.740
 of autonomic arousal is really high

34:45.740 --> 34:46.980
 and it's not being occupied

34:46.980 --> 34:48.580
 by all this stuff to pay attention to.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.980
 And so their salience network starts to turn inward.

34:50.980 --> 34:54.080
 They move from exteroception to interoception.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.740
 They're not looking outside themselves.

34:55.740 --> 34:56.820
 They're looking inside themselves

34:56.820 --> 34:58.780
 and there's a lot of noise in there.

34:58.780 --> 35:01.220
 So as a rule of thumb,

35:01.220 --> 35:04.720
 if you tend to be kind of on the high level of alertness

35:04.720 --> 35:06.540
 and kind of anxiety,

35:06.540 --> 35:08.740
 and I'm not talking about clinical levels of anxiety,

35:08.740 --> 35:11.380
 but you tend to be pretty high energy,

35:11.380 --> 35:14.560
 well then you are definitely going to benefit more

35:14.560 --> 35:17.220
 in a learning bout from learning to go

35:17.220 --> 35:20.140
 as well as activate the no-go pathway.

35:20.140 --> 35:21.700
 And that requires a lot of energy.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.300
 And when you have a lot of distractions in your environment,

35:24.300 --> 35:25.700
 there's a high probability

35:25.700 --> 35:28.020
 that you're going to be distracted from the learning.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.380
 Now, some people are just naturally more calm.

35:30.380 --> 35:33.580
 They're like my bulldog Costello, who's exceedingly calm.

35:33.580 --> 35:34.580
 They're pretty mellow.

35:34.580 --> 35:37.460
 They're kind of clear, calm, and focused all of the time.

35:37.460 --> 35:40.980
 And those people actually are going to be less flappable.

35:40.980 --> 35:43.980
 They're not going to be yanked around by background noise

35:43.980 --> 35:46.900
 or they're not going to be bothered from their learning

35:46.900 --> 35:49.240
 or from their studying by a clanging of a pot

35:49.240 --> 35:50.980
 from somebody in the kitchen.

35:50.980 --> 35:54.020
 So each one of us generally tends to ride up and down

35:54.020 --> 35:57.500
 this autonomic ladder, so to speak,

35:57.500 --> 35:58.500
 at different times of the day.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.920
 For most people, three hours after waking,

36:01.920 --> 36:04.420
 those three hours, not three hours on the mark,

36:04.420 --> 36:05.620
 but that three hour bin,

36:05.620 --> 36:07.060
 tends to be the period in which

36:07.060 --> 36:08.520
 they're most alert throughout the day.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.100
 Except I'll tell you later about a unique time

36:11.100 --> 36:14.020
 right before sleep in which you're also very, very alert,

36:14.020 --> 36:15.380
 naturally.

36:15.380 --> 36:18.640
 So that morning three hours is quite vital.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.660
 Now, many of you might ask about exercise

36:21.660 --> 36:23.220
 and when to exercise.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.380
 I think I may have mentioned this

36:24.380 --> 36:25.820
 on a previous podcast episode,

36:25.820 --> 36:28.780
 but the research shows that at least for performance,

36:28.780 --> 36:30.560
 afternoon exercise might be better

36:30.560 --> 36:32.140
 in terms of avoiding injury, et cetera.

36:32.140 --> 36:34.340
 But in terms of rising body temperatures,

36:35.700 --> 36:38.620
 and matching body temperature to mental alertness, et cetera,

36:38.620 --> 36:42.000
 it's pretty clear that exercising early in the day,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.780
 not only biases us towards waking up earlier,

36:44.780 --> 36:47.220
 but that it also triggers the release of things

36:47.220 --> 36:50.200
 like epinephrine and other neuromodulators

36:50.200 --> 36:53.540
 that lend itself to a situation

36:53.540 --> 36:56.360
 where we have heightened levels of arousal

36:56.360 --> 36:58.880
 and mental acuity in the late morning

36:58.880 --> 37:00.540
 and even into the afternoon.

37:00.540 --> 37:01.820
 This can be very good

37:01.820 --> 37:04.700
 because if you want to restrict most of your focus learning

37:04.700 --> 37:05.860
 to the early part of the day,

37:05.860 --> 37:09.960
 exercising early in the day does set a neurochemical context

37:09.960 --> 37:11.700
 or milieu for go.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.660
 It tends to trigger activation of the go pathway.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.380
 And so for those of you like myself,

37:16.380 --> 37:17.940
 who have a hard time kind of engaging

37:17.940 --> 37:19.780
 and getting into action early in the day,

37:19.780 --> 37:22.460
 early morning exercise within an hour of waking

37:22.460 --> 37:25.440
 and certainly no later than three hours after waking

37:25.440 --> 37:28.860
 will give you quote unquote more energy throughout the day.

37:28.860 --> 37:31.220
 It will make you feel more biased for action.

37:31.220 --> 37:32.820
 You won't feel as lethargic.

37:32.820 --> 37:35.840
 So in kind of reviewing what I've said up until now,

37:35.840 --> 37:37.520
 I do the morning light thing,

37:37.520 --> 37:40.500
 I delay my caffeine two hours after waking,

37:40.500 --> 37:44.900
 and then I generally try and get exercise in the first hour

37:44.900 --> 37:47.440
 or ideally within the first three hours of waking up

37:47.440 --> 37:49.980
 and then I'll move into a focused learning bout.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.520
 Now, some of you wrote to me and said,

37:52.520 --> 37:53.780
 if I exercise early in the day,

37:53.780 --> 37:55.380
 then I feel a crash afterwards.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.420
 If that exercise is very, very intense,

37:57.420 --> 37:59.060
 so you're depleting all your glycogen,

37:59.060 --> 38:01.060
 so you're doing heavy deadlifts, et cetera,

38:01.060 --> 38:04.700
 chances are after you eat, you will start to feel a crash.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.820
 So this relates to timing of nutrition.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.180
 And in just as a general rule of thumb,

38:09.180 --> 38:12.540
 fasted states and low carbohydrate states,

38:12.540 --> 38:14.740
 I'm not talking about a keto diet

38:14.740 --> 38:16.320
 round the clock or all week,

38:16.320 --> 38:20.860
 but fasted states and low carbohydrate states

38:20.860 --> 38:22.300
 lend themselves to alertness.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.740
 And that's because carbohydrates are rich in tryptophan

38:25.740 --> 38:28.860
 and they tend to lend themselves to sleepiness.

38:28.860 --> 38:31.700
 Of course, ingesting large amounts of any kind of food,

38:31.700 --> 38:35.260
 any substance that fills your gut will divert blood

38:35.260 --> 38:37.460
 to your gut, so if you eat a lot of food,

38:37.460 --> 38:38.300
 regardless of whether or not

38:38.300 --> 38:39.780
 it's a lot of carbohydrate or not,

38:39.780 --> 38:42.260
 you're going to generally feel more sleepy.

38:42.260 --> 38:45.180
 Now, many people, including everyone,

38:45.180 --> 38:49.580
 use food to modulate their levels of autonomic arousal.

38:49.580 --> 38:53.220
 And typically eating shifts us more towards a state of calm

38:53.220 --> 38:55.900
 and fasting shifts us more toward a state of alertness.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.420
 And these are hardwired circuits

38:57.420 --> 38:59.660
 that relate to the need and desire to find food,

38:59.660 --> 39:02.240
 which requires action, or the so-called

39:02.240 --> 39:05.560
 rest and digest system, which diverts our resources

39:05.560 --> 39:08.320
 and our energy towards digestion and makes us feel calm.

39:08.320 --> 39:13.320
 So I personally rely on water, mate, and black coffee

39:13.480 --> 39:16.180
 first thing in the day in order to exercise

39:16.180 --> 39:19.140
 and get into the first round of work.

39:19.140 --> 39:20.740
 If I find that I'm too alert,

39:20.740 --> 39:23.760
 and then I generally will tend to eat

39:23.760 --> 39:26.060
 and kind of bring down my level of alertness

39:26.060 --> 39:27.460
 and we'll continue working.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.700
 Now, this isn't a strict thing,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.300
 and since people ask me what I do,

39:31.300 --> 39:33.860
 and I'm not dictating that people follow it exactly,

39:33.860 --> 39:35.340
 of course, or even generally,

39:35.340 --> 39:36.580
 but I'll just tell you what I do.

39:36.580 --> 39:39.200
 It is possible if you're drinking black coffee

39:39.200 --> 39:42.220
 and you're, or mate, and you're ingesting a lot of water,

39:42.220 --> 39:44.340
 that you're going to dehydrate yourself somewhat

39:44.340 --> 39:46.560
 because of excretion of sodium.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.960
 Provided you don't have hypertension,

39:47.960 --> 39:49.620
 salt is a really good thing.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.120
 A lot of people think that they are low on blood sugar

39:52.120 --> 39:53.820
 because they're shaky and they can't think

39:53.820 --> 39:56.620
 or they have a headache when actually they're low on sodium.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.120
 And especially if you're drinking a lot of caffeine.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.640
 So I'm a big believer in salt.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.800
 So I drink salt water first thing in the morning

40:02.800 --> 40:03.920
 because I drink black coffee,

40:03.920 --> 40:05.940
 and that keeps my levels of alertness really good.

40:05.940 --> 40:08.220
 I always thought that I had messed up blood sugar.

40:08.220 --> 40:11.320
 I had shaky hands and I didn't know what was going on.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.660
 I'd drink a little bit of coffee and feel too amped up.

40:13.660 --> 40:16.060
 It turns out that it was a sodium issue.

40:16.060 --> 40:19.120
 And if I just drank water with a little bit of sea salt

40:19.120 --> 40:22.100
 and or even just a general table, typical table salt,

40:22.100 --> 40:24.860
 then I'd felt rock solid in terms of my blood sugar.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.860
 Now, again, I'm not a physician.

40:26.860 --> 40:29.160
 I'm a professor, so I don't prescribe anything,

40:29.160 --> 40:30.600
 but I profess lots of things.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.600
 So I don't want people who have diabetes

40:32.600 --> 40:34.840
 or blood sugar issues to go off the rails.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.080
 You're responsible for your health, not me.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.320
 But it's an interesting parameter to think about

40:39.320 --> 40:42.320
 and experiment with provided that your doctor says it's okay

40:42.320 --> 40:44.440
 because I think a lot of people

40:44.440 --> 40:45.660
 probably ingest too much sodium,

40:45.660 --> 40:47.400
 but a lot of people might be sodium deficient

40:47.400 --> 40:50.240
 in particular, the people that are fasting.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.900
 I typically eat my first meal right around midday,

40:54.900 --> 40:56.720
 whether or not I've exercised or not.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.940
 And the food content there is actually quite important to me.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.560
 I don't know why this is.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.040
 I don't have a scientific mechanism for this,

41:05.040 --> 41:08.040
 but if I eat hot food for lunch, I get sleepy after lunch.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.380
 So I generally don't eat hot food for lunch.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.200
 I might have a little bit of soup or something like that.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.840
 But in general, I rely on a low carbohydrate meal.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.040
 I'll eat meat or salad or some variation of that

41:18.040 --> 41:20.680
 and nuts and fats and things like that

41:20.680 --> 41:22.960
 because of the choline content for focus,

41:22.960 --> 41:25.440
 because the protein's good in my belief,

41:25.440 --> 41:27.620
 and because I believe in eating fruits and vegetables,

41:27.620 --> 41:28.460
 I do that too.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.820
 If I've exercised very hard early in the day,

41:30.820 --> 41:33.500
 I do ingest starches like oatmeal or rice

41:33.500 --> 41:34.820
 and fruit and things like that.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.040
 Now, why am I telling you all this?

41:36.040 --> 41:39.920
 Because hundreds, if not a thousand people ask me,

41:39.920 --> 41:42.000
 is fasting good for focus?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.900
 And indeed, fasting will increase alertness.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.640
 But if you're so hungry or preoccupied with food

41:47.640 --> 41:48.880
 that you can't focus,

41:48.880 --> 41:50.400
 well, then it's not going to be good for learning.

41:50.400 --> 41:53.060
 It's only going to be good for agitation.

41:53.060 --> 41:57.440
 Now, I'm just going to continue to march through my day.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.260
 And this is, of course, what I experienced.

42:00.260 --> 42:01.740
 Some people are quite different.

42:01.740 --> 42:04.520
 But what I find is around two or 3 p.m.,

42:04.520 --> 42:07.560
 I start getting a little groggy, a little bit sleepy.

42:07.560 --> 42:10.020
 I will tend to shift my work

42:10.020 --> 42:13.340
 from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome,

42:13.340 --> 42:17.480
 really careful analysis and activation of the no-go pathway,

42:17.480 --> 42:19.480
 meaning I'm trying to suppress the impulse

42:19.480 --> 42:21.900
 to look at my phone or answer email or do other things.

42:21.900 --> 42:23.340
 This is why I haven't emailed you back

42:23.340 --> 42:25.360
 until three in the afternoon, by the way,

42:25.360 --> 42:26.800
 or responded to your text messages,

42:26.800 --> 42:28.100
 whoever you are out there.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.520
 Around early afternoon,

42:31.520 --> 42:35.500
 I find I can do kind of typical, more mundane tasks

42:35.500 --> 42:40.500
 because those tasks require less cognitive load,

42:42.040 --> 42:45.600
 and they can be done more or less in and out of sequence.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.000
 I can answer a couple of email here,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.500
 maybe answer that email there.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.000
 I don't have to do it in pure linear fashion.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.320
 Any kind of linear work or learning work

42:53.320 --> 42:54.840
 is going to take a lot of focus.

42:54.840 --> 42:59.840
 And then typically around 4 p.m. or so, I do two things.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.520
 Sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later,

43:01.520 --> 43:03.260
 but I do two things.

43:03.260 --> 43:05.440
 One is I make sure I hydrate

43:05.440 --> 43:07.480
 because if you're exercising and you're eating,

43:07.480 --> 43:09.700
 you need to digest that food, et cetera.

43:09.700 --> 43:11.680
 I make sure I hydrate so I drink water.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.200
 I try and refrain from drinking coffee in the afternoon.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.400
 This is a new thing for me.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.800
 I sometimes do it, but I try and refrain from that.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.800
 And then I always do a non-sleep deep rest protocol

43:22.800 --> 43:23.900
 sometime in the afternoon.

43:23.900 --> 43:26.880
 This is sometimes a 10-minute yoga nidra type protocol

43:26.880 --> 43:29.720
 or a 30-minute yoga nidra type protocol.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.720
 These are protocols that I have no relationship to,

43:31.720 --> 43:33.560
 no business relationship to whatsoever.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.520
 I've been doing them for years now.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.600
 They involve listening to a script.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.980
 We'll provide the links again,

43:38.980 --> 43:41.560
 although we've provided them before.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.960
 Or I'll do a hypnosis protocol from Reverie Health,

43:44.960 --> 43:48.120
 which is my colleague David Spiegel's website

43:48.120 --> 43:50.440
 that has these free hypnosis apps

43:50.440 --> 43:52.920
 or scripts that you can listen to.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.540
 And those take me into a state of really deep rest,

43:56.540 --> 43:58.520
 sometimes so much so that I fall asleep.

43:58.520 --> 43:59.600
 And I always set an alarm

43:59.600 --> 44:01.480
 so that I don't sleep for longer than 90 minutes.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.600
 But typically this goes for about 30 minutes.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.760
 And I do that because for me, by about 4.30 in the afternoon

44:07.760 --> 44:10.280
 I'm capable of doing basically nothing.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.740
 I am just a complete Costello.

44:12.740 --> 44:17.320
 I can't think, I can't do, I can't respond to email.

44:17.320 --> 44:21.460
 I've just completely trough my ability to function.

44:21.460 --> 44:24.960
 I personally find it a mistake to at that point

44:24.960 --> 44:28.200
 down a double espresso and charge really hard.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.300
 It just doesn't work for me.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.380
 I end up really disrupting my sleep schedule.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.080
 I end up disrupting a lot of different things.

44:33.080 --> 44:36.400
 So for me, I do the non-sleep deep rest protocol.

44:36.400 --> 44:39.200
 It really helps me later when I need to fall asleep.

44:39.200 --> 44:42.320
 It helps with all sorts of things, as I mentioned before.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.600
 But I usually emerge from that a little groggy

44:45.600 --> 44:49.940
 or feeling like I have another whole day, second wind.

44:49.940 --> 44:51.760
 Like I could just work, work, work, work, work.

44:51.760 --> 44:55.400
 And then I'll do a second bout of learning.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.760
 I'll do some sort of work

44:56.760 --> 45:00.360
 that either involves linear analysis of something.

45:00.360 --> 45:04.660
 So maybe numerical work or I'm trying to learn something.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.800
 I generally try and really use those bouts

45:07.800 --> 45:10.920
 of 90 minute focused energy after the non-sleep deep rest.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.480
 And as I mentioned in previous episodes,

45:12.480 --> 45:14.000
 there's a lot of evidence

45:14.000 --> 45:15.840
 that these non-sleep deep rest protocols

45:15.840 --> 45:18.120
 can enhance and accelerate plasticity.

45:18.120 --> 45:22.440
 The most, I think, recent and striking one

45:22.440 --> 45:24.660
 is the study that we referenced last time

45:24.660 --> 45:25.760
 in the caption notes.

45:25.760 --> 45:29.800
 It was the Cell Press article, Cell Reports, great journal,

45:29.800 --> 45:33.960
 was showing that these 20 minute kind of shallow naps

45:33.960 --> 45:35.000
 in non-sleep deep rest

45:35.000 --> 45:37.520
 can facilitate sensory motor learning.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.920
 So then I'll go into another learning bout

45:38.920 --> 45:40.280
 that's caffeine free.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.280
 This learning bout is very different than the morning one.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.080
 This is a work bout or learning bout

45:45.080 --> 45:47.400
 that's more in the clear common focus regime

45:47.400 --> 45:50.180
 because I've come out of this non-sleep deep rest.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.640
 I'm not ingesting caffeine

45:51.640 --> 45:52.480
 because I want to make sure

45:52.480 --> 45:54.960
 that I can sleep later that night really well.

45:54.960 --> 45:59.060
 And this tends to be more when I do creative type work.

45:59.060 --> 46:00.480
 Now, creativity is a topic

46:00.480 --> 46:02.960
 that we're going to spend the entire month on

46:02.960 --> 46:04.200
 coming up soon.

46:04.200 --> 46:07.280
 But creativity is a very interesting state of mind

46:07.280 --> 46:09.920
 in which we're taking existing elements,

46:09.920 --> 46:12.200
 things that we already know

46:12.200 --> 46:15.840
 and rearranging them in ways that are novel.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.240
 And I'd say, well, duh, that's what creativity is.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.300
 But creativity has two parts.

46:21.300 --> 46:25.020
 It has a creative discovery mode

46:25.020 --> 46:26.720
 where you're kind of shuffling things around

46:26.720 --> 46:28.960
 in a very relaxed way and kind of being playful

46:28.960 --> 46:31.600
 or exploring different configurations.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.880
 And then creativity also has

46:33.880 --> 46:36.840
 an absolutely linear implementation mode

46:36.840 --> 46:40.160
 in which you take the idea or the design you've come up with

46:40.160 --> 46:43.600
 and you create something very robust and concrete.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.460
 And so creativity is really a two-part thing.

46:46.460 --> 46:48.040
 And the first part

46:48.040 --> 46:50.880
 of actively exploring different configurations,

46:50.880 --> 46:52.560
 sometimes in a playful way,

46:52.560 --> 46:56.200
 sometimes in a way that's almost random

46:56.200 --> 46:58.320
 and just kind of exploring,

46:58.320 --> 47:02.320
 that state is definitely facilitated

47:02.320 --> 47:06.200
 by being relaxed and almost sleepy.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.440
 That is not a state that I personally can access

47:08.440 --> 47:09.680
 very well early in the day.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.560
 I've tried to access it coming out of sleep

47:11.560 --> 47:12.500
 because one would say,

47:12.500 --> 47:13.900
 well, you're still sleepy early in the day.

47:13.900 --> 47:14.740
 And it just doesn't work.

47:14.740 --> 47:15.760
 Most of what I write down,

47:15.760 --> 47:18.000
 most of what I do is complete garbage.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.840
 And so what I found is there's this block in the afternoon

47:20.840 --> 47:24.540
 of about 90 minutes where I can do creative type writing

47:24.540 --> 47:29.360
 or creative type imagination of scientific ideas

47:29.360 --> 47:30.720
 or experiments we might want to do.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.560
 Science might not seem like a creative endeavor

47:32.560 --> 47:33.840
 to many of you, but it is,

47:33.840 --> 47:36.480
 has a lot of imagining what if this,

47:36.480 --> 47:39.200
 or we could combine that and thinking of novel concepts

47:39.200 --> 47:40.920
 or ways of arranging things.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.240
 So when you find yourself

47:42.240 --> 47:44.480
 in that kind of clear, calm, and focused mode,

47:44.480 --> 47:47.440
 creative works tend to come about very well

47:47.440 --> 47:49.000
 in those regimes.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.360
 Now, I know that a lot of people out there

47:50.360 --> 47:53.940
 rely on substances to access creative states.

47:53.940 --> 47:55.400
 I'm not a marijuana user.

47:55.400 --> 47:59.000
 It's just not the drug for me for a variety of reasons.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.440
 I'm not a drinker.

48:00.440 --> 48:04.040
 It's not the substance for me for a variety of reasons.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.400
 You know, I'm not a cop.

48:05.400 --> 48:06.600
 I'm not out here to tell people

48:06.600 --> 48:08.160
 what they should do or shouldn't do.

48:08.160 --> 48:11.740
 The problem with using substances to access creativity

48:11.740 --> 48:13.840
 is that generally the ones that,

48:13.840 --> 48:15.880
 the substances that relax people

48:15.880 --> 48:19.780
 will allow them to get into that creative brainstorming mode

48:19.780 --> 48:23.800
 but not so good at the linear implementation mode.

48:24.640 --> 48:28.460
 You know, the other day I was remarking with a friend

48:28.460 --> 48:30.880
 that there are some ads, some advertisements

48:30.880 --> 48:34.880
 that I've seen over the years that are just incredible.

48:34.880 --> 48:35.800
 I'll just tell you what they are

48:35.800 --> 48:36.920
 so that it's not cryptic or anything.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.000
 I'm revealing my taste here.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.320
 There's a particular perfume ad that Spike Jones made

48:42.320 --> 48:43.760
 that is just amazing.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.880
 It's just, I'll put a link to it

48:44.880 --> 48:46.680
 because it's just so cool.

48:46.680 --> 48:48.960
 And it's just so, and it has an,

48:48.960 --> 48:49.900
 I don't want to give away the end,

48:49.900 --> 48:50.900
 but it has a feature of it

48:50.900 --> 48:54.720
 that is particularly interesting to me as a neuroscientist.

48:54.720 --> 48:55.560
 And it's just so cool.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.740
 And I, because I grew up in the skateboarding thing,

48:57.740 --> 48:59.760
 I knew a little bit about Spike's movies and skateboarding.

48:59.760 --> 49:02.240
 And he's of course made a lot of very impressive,

49:02.240 --> 49:05.200
 popular movies as well, full length features.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.860
 I don't know him personally, so this isn't a plug,

49:07.860 --> 49:10.340
 not that he needs my endorsement for anything at all.

49:10.340 --> 49:14.760
 But the amazing thing about this advertisement

49:14.760 --> 49:17.280
 is it's a kind of, it's a collection of things

49:17.280 --> 49:19.880
 that you would never really think would be combined.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.120
 And it involves different speeds of motion

49:22.120 --> 49:23.600
 and all sorts of effects.

49:23.600 --> 49:24.880
 I mean, it's like a real classic,

49:24.880 --> 49:26.960
 like Spike Jones kind of delivery.

49:26.960 --> 49:30.460
 But what's incredible is when you think about

49:30.460 --> 49:32.840
 not just the fact that someone had to imagine that,

49:32.840 --> 49:35.280
 but to actually implement the steps

49:35.280 --> 49:37.060
 in order to create that.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.780
 When you see this, you'll realize that was a ton of work.

49:39.780 --> 49:41.520
 You can't just put that together randomly.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.400
 And so a lot of people, not Spike clearly,

49:45.400 --> 49:49.640
 but a lot of people who have an incredible mind

49:49.640 --> 49:53.440
 for ideas and novel arrangements of things,

49:53.440 --> 49:55.360
 they are great at accessing that state,

49:55.360 --> 49:58.080
 but not so good at accessing the implementation state.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.900
 And then it's also true that a lot of people

50:00.900 --> 50:03.000
 and some who tend to fall on what we would call

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
 the kind of like more Asperger's

50:05.000 --> 50:06.760
 or autism end of the spectrum

50:06.760 --> 50:09.160
 are very good at linear implementation.

50:09.160 --> 50:11.200
 Now I'm not talking about all forms of autism, of course,

50:11.200 --> 50:13.120
 I'm sensitive to the fact that there are many forms

50:13.120 --> 50:14.260
 on the spectrum.

50:14.260 --> 50:17.880
 But some people are very good at linear implementation.

50:17.880 --> 50:22.200
 And that's a separate state from a creative states.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.600
 So that afternoon block is when I try

50:24.600 --> 50:27.980
 and access the freer kind of looser mindset

50:27.980 --> 50:29.280
 that's associated with the fatigue

50:29.280 --> 50:30.980
 that comes later in the afternoon.

50:31.980 --> 50:36.160
 And for some of you, that state that favors creativity

50:36.160 --> 50:39.040
 and creative learning might be better in the morning.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.680
 I don't know, you're going to have to decide.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.720
 For some of you, you're going to be late shifted.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.340
 Some of you are going to be morning shifted.

50:44.340 --> 50:45.720
 But where we have alertness,

50:45.720 --> 50:47.860
 generally we are good at linear implementation.

50:47.860 --> 50:50.080
 We're good at activating the no-go pathway

50:50.080 --> 50:51.240
 and suppressing action.

50:51.240 --> 50:54.960
 And we are good at pursuing particular goals

50:54.960 --> 50:56.800
 and strategy implementation.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.000
 And where we tend to be more relaxed

50:59.000 --> 51:01.080
 and we tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode.

51:01.080 --> 51:02.800
 So for me coming out of one of these non-sleep,

51:02.800 --> 51:04.800
 deep rest modes or sleep,

51:04.800 --> 51:08.680
 that's when we tend to be better at novel configurations

51:08.680 --> 51:11.120
 of existing elements, which is creativity.

51:11.120 --> 51:15.240
 And this brings about a question that I get all the time,

51:15.240 --> 51:18.200
 which is what about psychedelics?

51:18.200 --> 51:22.480
 So I am going to talk to some experts on psychedelics.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.480
 I hope to bring some of them in.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.120
 Actually speaking of people coming in

51:26.120 --> 51:28.320
 or creatures coming in,

51:28.320 --> 51:30.200
 a creature that's definitely not on psychedelics

51:30.200 --> 51:33.220
 who doesn't need any is Costello and he just arrived.

51:33.220 --> 51:35.760
 He seems to be in a sleepy state most all the time.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.760
 Hey buddy, how you doing?

51:37.760 --> 51:38.980
 You come in?

51:38.980 --> 51:39.820
 Yeah.

51:39.820 --> 51:44.200
 He's working on his 15th sleep deep rest episode of the day,

51:44.200 --> 51:45.300
 which is generally followed

51:45.300 --> 51:48.580
 by a 10 to 12 hour deep rest episodes,

51:48.580 --> 51:51.360
 almost exclusively comprised of Rem.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.920
 And I know this because his eyes are open

51:52.920 --> 51:53.760
 because they're so droopy.

51:53.760 --> 51:54.640
 He can't close them all away

51:54.640 --> 51:56.400
 and his eyes are going like this

51:56.400 --> 51:58.120
 and he's going down for the count.

51:58.120 --> 52:01.560
 So yeah, nice and big yawn.

52:01.560 --> 52:04.520
 Okay, so psychedelics.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.240
 First of all, I want to be very clear.

52:06.240 --> 52:09.640
 I am neither a proponent nor am I somebody

52:09.640 --> 52:13.180
 who rejects the potential role of psychedelics.

52:13.180 --> 52:15.880
 I do however, think that psychedelics

52:15.880 --> 52:18.160
 can be particularly hazardous

52:18.160 --> 52:21.260
 for people who have preexisting psychological issues

52:21.260 --> 52:25.040
 and are not working with a board certified psychiatrist

52:25.040 --> 52:29.680
 or physician, as well as for essentially all kids.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.040
 I think that the young brain is basically

52:32.040 --> 52:34.680
 in its own psychedelic state and just naturally

52:35.620 --> 52:37.520
 and all kidding aside,

52:37.520 --> 52:40.360
 I think that the young brain is so subject

52:40.360 --> 52:43.080
 to neuroplasticity that drugs,

52:43.080 --> 52:45.880
 which like psychedelics, which are very powerful

52:45.880 --> 52:48.240
 can be detrimental to the developing brain.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.320
 That's just my stance.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.660
 If anyone disagrees with me,

52:50.660 --> 52:52.700
 I'd be happy to chat with you about it

52:52.700 --> 52:55.480
 in a polite and discourse.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.480
 I'll be happy to listen as well as tell you more

52:57.480 --> 52:59.640
 why I believe that based on the data.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.760
 I'm mentioning psychedelics because many of you asked,

53:03.760 --> 53:05.920
 here's the deal with psychedelics.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.820
 At least here's how they work.

53:07.820 --> 53:12.400
 In a nutshell, psychedelics were thought

53:12.400 --> 53:16.560
 to unleash sensory processing and to make it less filtered.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.300
 We have a lot of different inputs from our eyes,

53:18.300 --> 53:20.200
 from our ears, from our nose, from our taste, et cetera,

53:20.200 --> 53:22.120
 that you're coming in all the time in parallel.

53:22.120 --> 53:25.120
 And we have mechanisms that suppress some of those

53:25.120 --> 53:26.720
 and allow us to only focus on things

53:26.720 --> 53:28.120
 that are happening visually.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.880
 Generally, we don't have synesthesia

53:29.880 --> 53:32.040
 unless some of us happen to have synesthesia.

53:32.040 --> 53:34.460
 We don't blend what we see with what we hear

53:34.460 --> 53:37.280
 in a way that is confusing to us.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.540
 We know what's making sounds

53:38.540 --> 53:42.660
 and we know what is a visual stimulus.

53:42.660 --> 53:46.220
 On psychedelics, people report being able to smell colors

53:46.220 --> 53:49.800
 or to hear trees, et cetera.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.840
 And that's because there's a lot of sensory blending.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.440
 However, that's led to the misconception

53:54.440 --> 53:58.080
 that sensory blending itself is a creative process.

53:58.080 --> 54:01.060
 There's nothing creative about sensory blending.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.580
 The essence of a creative process

54:05.580 --> 54:08.980
 is that some novel configuration of elements,

54:08.980 --> 54:11.040
 whether or not it's notes on a piano

54:11.040 --> 54:12.400
 or whether or not it's words on a page,

54:12.400 --> 54:15.040
 whether or not it's numbers or whether or not it's movement,

54:15.040 --> 54:20.040
 that some way in which those are configured in some new way,

54:20.840 --> 54:25.040
 that the algorithm, the way in which they are configured

54:25.040 --> 54:27.280
 makes sense to the observer.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.500
 And this is a key thing.

54:28.500 --> 54:30.120
 It seems to me that when people report

54:30.120 --> 54:31.760
 their psychedelic experiences,

54:31.760 --> 54:34.520
 it makes a lot more sense to the person who experiences it

54:34.520 --> 54:35.840
 than to the observer.

54:35.840 --> 54:40.260
 And so creative works, by definition,

54:40.260 --> 54:43.640
 are new ways of configuring things that lend themselves

54:43.640 --> 54:47.920
 to a bigger or greater or deeper or novel understanding

54:47.920 --> 54:49.820
 on the part of the observer.

54:49.820 --> 54:52.900
 And just sensory blending is not going to accomplish that.

54:52.900 --> 54:54.960
 Now it is true, and there's a great review

54:54.960 --> 54:56.880
 in the journal Cell, excellent journal,

54:56.880 --> 54:58.260
 about how psychedelics work.

54:58.260 --> 55:00.920
 And it turns out they don't just work

55:00.920 --> 55:03.840
 by allowing for more sensory blending.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.560
 They do, because of the way that they activate

55:06.560 --> 55:08.420
 certain serotonin receptors, et cetera,

55:08.420 --> 55:11.640
 they do lend themselves to more lateral connectivity

55:11.640 --> 55:14.920
 between different brain areas, more novel associations.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.720
 So in principle, in principle, I should say,

55:17.720 --> 55:20.000
 not necessarily in practice, but in principle,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.900
 they do allow different areas of the brain,

55:22.900 --> 55:24.360
 maybe even the two sides of the brain,

55:24.360 --> 55:27.660
 to communicate more broadly than they would normally.

55:27.660 --> 55:31.840
 So that has certain elements that speak to creativity,

55:31.840 --> 55:33.920
 but it can't simply be the case

55:33.920 --> 55:37.520
 that psychedelics are the portal to creativity,

55:37.520 --> 55:39.760
 because creativity, as I mentioned before,

55:39.760 --> 55:42.720
 involves not just novel associations

55:42.720 --> 55:45.360
 and a breaking of kind of space-time rules.

55:45.360 --> 55:48.400
 It also involves reconfiguring things

55:48.400 --> 55:52.080
 such that the new space-time rule that one comes up with

55:52.080 --> 55:55.740
 is interesting, stimulating, and kind of, in many cases,

55:55.740 --> 55:58.100
 delightful to the observer.

55:58.100 --> 56:01.040
 And that's why many claims

56:01.040 --> 56:03.560
 that psychedelics open plasticity

56:03.560 --> 56:06.240
 or they increase creativity,

56:06.240 --> 56:08.640
 that's not sufficient for me personally.

56:08.640 --> 56:09.720
 I'm curious about,

56:09.720 --> 56:13.040
 does it not just open the creative thinking process,

56:13.040 --> 56:14.640
 this novel configuration process,

56:14.640 --> 56:16.800
 but does it also lend itself

56:16.800 --> 56:19.040
 to the implementation of creative works?

56:19.040 --> 56:21.220
 And the answer is no.

56:21.220 --> 56:23.800
 In most cases, it has nothing to do

56:23.800 --> 56:25.600
 with creative implementation.

56:25.600 --> 56:29.200
 Now, I think that there may come a time,

56:29.200 --> 56:30.520
 and certainly there are clinical trials

56:30.520 --> 56:31.580
 that are happening now,

56:31.580 --> 56:32.920
 where psychedelics are leveraged

56:32.920 --> 56:34.920
 toward particular clinical goals.

56:34.920 --> 56:37.720
 And I want to tip my hat to the work at Johns Hopkins

56:37.720 --> 56:38.960
 that's happening now,

56:38.960 --> 56:42.480
 which really lends itself to the idea,

56:42.480 --> 56:44.560
 the early preliminary data and some of the papers

56:44.560 --> 56:46.480
 that are coming out of there are really fantastic,

56:46.480 --> 56:50.500
 showing that there may be some excellent roles

56:50.500 --> 56:53.160
 for certain psychedelics in certain clinical contexts.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.960
 These are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present

56:56.800 --> 56:58.400
 that is authorized to do that,

56:58.400 --> 57:01.000
 that can help people through depression, trauma, et cetera.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.600
 And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about that,

57:03.600 --> 57:06.360
 including with some of those folks running those studies.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.880
 So we can look forward to that.

57:07.880 --> 57:10.000
 So all of this is to say that,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.400
 no, I don't take psychedelics to access creative states.

57:13.400 --> 57:16.840
 That's not where I think the major role,

57:16.840 --> 57:19.280
 the important role of psychedelics might show up

57:19.280 --> 57:20.720
 if it's going to for humanity.

57:20.720 --> 57:23.480
 I think that it may have these important roles

57:23.480 --> 57:24.760
 in the clinical context,

57:24.760 --> 57:27.400
 provided it's done legally and safely.

57:27.400 --> 57:31.920
 I think that the creative process being a two-stage process

57:31.920 --> 57:34.900
 means that I am personally best served

57:34.900 --> 57:39.440
 by having this period of non-linear exploration of concepts,

57:39.440 --> 57:42.640
 whatever it is I happen to be working on in the afternoon,

57:42.640 --> 57:44.960
 but then I'll actually shelve that work.

57:44.960 --> 57:48.140
 I'll just set it aside and then I'll revisit it the next day

57:48.140 --> 57:50.840
 or even the next day to see whether or not

57:50.840 --> 57:53.520
 that the work itself is ready

57:53.520 --> 57:55.560
 for deliberate linear implementation,

57:55.560 --> 57:57.320
 which I would want to do during one of these

57:57.320 --> 57:58.500
 highly focused states.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.600
 So the long and short way of saying this is that

58:01.600 --> 58:04.620
 when we're very alert, do linear type of operations.

58:04.620 --> 58:07.360
 When we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed,

58:07.360 --> 58:11.120
 that's when creative works can first be conceived,

58:11.120 --> 58:15.440
 but their implementation requires high levels of alertness.

58:15.440 --> 58:20.320
 Now that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon evening.

58:20.320 --> 58:22.360
 Now I am, as I've mentioned before,

58:22.360 --> 58:26.080
 I'm a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well.

58:26.080 --> 58:30.400
 This is a critical thing that I have not mentioned before.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.140
 Here's how it works.

58:32.140 --> 58:33.760
 Many people now have heard me say

58:33.760 --> 58:35.900
 getting light early in the day is important,

58:35.900 --> 58:38.680
 but that will advance one's clock.

58:38.680 --> 58:41.520
 It'll make you want to get up earlier the next day.

58:41.520 --> 58:43.020
 By getting light in the evening,

58:43.020 --> 58:44.600
 it accomplishes two things for me.

58:44.600 --> 58:47.400
 First of all, it makes sure that I don't get up too early,

58:47.400 --> 58:49.420
 that I'm not waking up at three or four in the morning

58:49.420 --> 58:52.120
 because it's going to shift my clock.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.880
 It's going to delay it a little bit.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.880
 And so this is really important.

58:55.880 --> 58:59.800
 If you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine

58:59.800 --> 59:02.320
 on a regular 24-hour cycle

59:02.320 --> 59:04.760
 and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness

59:04.760 --> 59:05.940
 drifting all over the place,

59:05.940 --> 59:07.240
 and you want some predictability

59:07.240 --> 59:08.760
 to how your mind is going to work

59:08.760 --> 59:11.040
 in order to optimize learning and performance,

59:11.040 --> 59:13.300
 well, then you need to get morning light and evening light.

59:13.300 --> 59:15.140
 The morning light is going to advance my clock,

59:15.140 --> 59:16.880
 make my system want to get up earlier,

59:16.880 --> 59:19.360
 and the evening light is going to delay my clock

59:19.360 --> 59:20.640
 a little bit so that on average,

59:20.640 --> 59:23.240
 it kind of bookends my circadian mechanisms,

59:23.240 --> 59:25.260
 and I'll basically want to go to sleep

59:25.260 --> 59:26.800
 at more or less the same time each night

59:26.800 --> 59:30.200
 and wake up more or less at the same time each morning.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.400
 That's how it works.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.000
 And that's a hardwired mechanism.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.520
 That's not some subjective thing that I tell myself.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.720
 That's a hardwired mechanism.

59:38.720 --> 59:41.100
 So that gets us to the evening.

59:41.100 --> 59:42.360
 And generally in the evening,

59:42.360 --> 59:44.040
 I'll get that light by going outside,

59:44.040 --> 59:44.960
 or sometimes I'll do it

59:44.960 --> 59:47.120
 by turning up artificial lights brightly,

59:47.120 --> 59:49.000
 and then I'll start to dim them for the evening

59:49.000 --> 59:50.540
 because as I've mentioned many times before,

59:50.540 --> 59:52.160
 and I'm not going to belabor the point,

59:52.160 --> 59:54.360
 you want to minimize your light exposure,

59:54.360 --> 59:56.280
 especially overhead bright light exposure,

59:56.280 --> 59:58.560
 regardless of whether or not it's blue light or not,

59:58.560 --> 1:00:01.080
 in the evening from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.

1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:02.280
 Some of you asked,

1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:04.560
 wait, I thought it was 11 p.m. to 4 a.m.

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:08.080
 Well, it is, but 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. is even better.

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:11.960
 It's just that when I originally said 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,

1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:12.800
 people were like,

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:14.600
 that's impossible for most people to adhere to.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:18.660
 So for me, it screens off, it's dim lights,

1:00:18.660 --> 1:00:21.000
 and that's what favors falling asleep

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.180
 in a good night's sleep for me.

1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:24.640
 Since we were talking about food earlier,

1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:27.180
 I'll just revisit a little bit of what I said before.

1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:30.800
 My evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate rich,

1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:33.240
 if I have proteins, it'll be like eggs, fish,

1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:35.840
 or chicken or something of that sort, or no protein,

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.760
 and I eat high carbohydrates.

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:40.080
 So I'm not one of these people that's keto

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:43.120
 or high meat only or anything like that.

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.440
 Remember, fasting in low carbohydrate states

1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:47.540
 facilitate alertness.

1:00:47.540 --> 1:00:51.440
 Carbohydrate rich foods facilitate calmness and sleepiness.

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:53.160
 They stimulate the release of tryptophan

1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:55.120
 and the transition to sleep.

1:00:55.120 --> 1:00:56.540
 So that's why I do them late in the day.

1:00:56.540 --> 1:00:59.300
 Also, if you've exercised early in the day,

1:00:59.300 --> 1:01:01.080
 especially if it's weight-bearing exercise,

1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:02.640
 or everything's weight-bearing exercise,

1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:03.880
 I suppose, unless you're an astronaut,

1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:05.680
 but, and you're in space.

1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:08.400
 But if you're early in the day exercising with weights

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:10.920
 or you're doing a long run or something, sooner or later,

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:12.760
 you need to replenish glycogen.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.700
 And I realized that the ketonistas out there are gonna say,

1:01:15.700 --> 1:01:18.380
 well, gluconeogenesis will allow you

1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:20.200
 to replenish glycogen, et cetera.

1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:24.120
 I'm just gonna call out the lie right now

1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:25.360
 because I feel like doing it,

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:27.820
 and because I think it just hasn't been stated,

1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:32.160
 which is that not everybody, but a lot of the people

1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:36.800
 that are proponents of high meat keto diets, fine.

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:39.320
 That's fine if that's what they wanna do.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:42.960
 And as you recall, I do relatively ketogenic diet

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:46.080
 during the day for alertness or fasting,

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:50.320
 but a lot of those people can replenish glycogen really well

1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:53.420
 without ingesting carbohydrates, so-called gluconeogenesis

1:01:53.420 --> 1:01:55.580
 and enhanced protein synthesis,

1:01:55.580 --> 1:01:57.800
 because they are hormone-enhanced.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:00.840
 And it's just, I've been around a while.

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:01.960
 I know what this looks like.

1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:04.400
 They're either thyroid-enhanced or hormone-enhanced,

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.140
 and I don't pass any judgment.

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:09.240
 But when you look at people who look amazing on keto

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:11.040
 and are able to have a lot of energy

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.660
 and replenish their glycogen on keto,

1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:18.420
 they are, in many cases, not all,

1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:20.320
 but in many cases, they're hormone-enhanced.

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:22.400
 They're taking exogenous hormones

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:26.380
 that allow them to synthesize and repair muscle

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:28.080
 in ways that people who aren't taking

1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:29.520
 those exogenous hormones can't.

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.460
 This is not just true of the men, by the way.

1:02:31.460 --> 1:02:32.760
 This is also true of the women.

1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:34.320
 And this is a whole discussion unto itself,

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.680
 probably not directly related to this month of the podcast.

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.880
 So I don't mind that people do this,

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:43.720
 but one problem is when people are following

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.680
 ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep

1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:46.780
 and they have trouble with sleep,

1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:48.280
 or they're doing long bouts of fasting

1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:50.120
 and they're having trouble falling asleep,

1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:50.940
 that makes sense.

1:02:50.940 --> 1:02:52.320
 It's because their autonomic arousal

1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:54.840
 is tilted towards epinephrine release,

1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:57.200
 norepinephrine release, and dopamine release.

1:02:57.200 --> 1:02:58.200
 So they have a lot of energy,

1:02:58.200 --> 1:02:59.620
 but they have a hard time calming down

1:02:59.620 --> 1:03:01.400
 and getting into deep sleep.

1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:04.180
 I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates,

1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:06.340
 and it also replenishes glycogen.

1:03:06.340 --> 1:03:08.960
 So again, I'm not trying to draw any fire,

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:12.520
 but if I do, I'd be happy to have a conversation

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:13.960
 about all that.

1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:16.600
 Again, no judgment, but I think that most people out there

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:19.400
 are not aware of some of the other variables.

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.720
 Remember, good science is about isolating variables.

1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:24.640
 And so oftentimes what we're seeing in social media

1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:27.000
 is we're getting presented single variables

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.560
 and we're not seeing the full context

1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:31.120
 of the other variables that are being manipulated.

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:34.280
 So I eat pasta and rice and vegetables

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:35.320
 and things like that in the evening.

1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.080
 Also, I just find,

1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:39.960
 maybe I'm becoming one of the last people that does that,

1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:40.800
 although I hope not,

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.760
 I hope there are others out there like me,

1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:45.160
 but I just, from all the literature,

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:48.000
 speaks to the fact that carbohydrates not only do that,

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.260
 but they also help maintain healthy thyroid function,

1:03:50.260 --> 1:03:51.100
 et cetera.

1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:52.840
 So that's my bias, that's what I do.

1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:55.760
 I do avoid caffeine and whatnot in the evening.

1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:58.220
 I do take supplements and I'll be happy at some point

1:03:58.220 --> 1:03:59.920
 to put out the complete list of supplements

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:01.920
 that I take out there.

1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:05.160
 But in general, these are the core things that I do

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.820
 and they relate to a lot of the questions

1:04:06.820 --> 1:04:09.200
 that you've been asking over time.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.960
 The next piece of scientific data that I'm going to describe

1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:14.520
 is a very important piece of scientific data

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:16.780
 for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain

1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:17.900
 and access sleep.

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:22.220
 It also can help and avoid a lot of anxiety issues.

1:04:22.220 --> 1:04:26.240
 And these relate to data from Charles Zeisler, doctor,

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:29.340
 he's an MD, Chuck Zeisler's lab at Harvard Medical School.

1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:31.400
 He's run a sleep lab out of Harvard Medical School

1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:34.360
 for a long time now, does very impressive work.

1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:37.840
 What he's shown is that the peak output

1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:40.480
 of the circadian clock for wakefulness,

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:42.600
 in other words, the peak of our wakefulness

1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:45.920
 and the suppression of the sleep signal

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:49.100
 actually happens very late in the day.

1:04:49.100 --> 1:04:52.360
 So we have this trough of activity

1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:55.460
 and body temperature is lowest right before waking.

1:04:55.460 --> 1:04:57.720
 Then as we wake up, our body temperature goes up

1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:00.120
 and into the afternoon, it continues to go up, up, up, up,

1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:02.260
 and then it tends to fall in the evening

1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:03.960
 and towards bedtime.

1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:08.760
 But there's a brief blip of release of peptides

1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:13.040
 and other substances from the sleep centers in the brain

1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:14.880
 and the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:17.520
 The sleep center is this pre-optic area

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:19.080
 that if you wanna look that up,

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:21.520
 this pre-optic area not far from the circadian clock

1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:23.760
 that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness

1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:26.920
 about an hour before bedtime.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:28.340
 And you say, well, that's really weird,

1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:29.860
 but a lot of people get into bed,

1:05:29.860 --> 1:05:32.680
 they're ready to go to sleep and they're wide awake.

1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:34.260
 And they think this is an unnatural thing

1:05:34.260 --> 1:05:36.260
 or there's something wrong with them.

1:05:36.260 --> 1:05:37.780
 And actually it's not.

1:05:37.780 --> 1:05:40.800
 This it's believed, I don't know,

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:42.900
 again, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,

1:05:42.900 --> 1:05:45.080
 but this is, it's believed,

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:47.920
 is a signal that is helpful to human beings

1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:50.320
 to start gathering up resources

1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:52.380
 and securing themselves for a night's sleep

1:05:52.380 --> 1:05:55.200
 during which we historically were very vulnerable

1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.880
 to attack from other humans and from animals and so forth.

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:02.140
 And so that desire to run around and clean the kitchen

1:06:02.140 --> 1:06:03.000
 or organize things,

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.440
 or just a general feeling of internal anxiety

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:06.880
 late in the evening,

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:09.940
 that's a natural blip that naturally passes

1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:12.360
 after about 45 to 60 minutes.

1:06:12.360 --> 1:06:15.240
 Now that's often the time when people start stressing

1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:17.120
 about the fact that they have something to do the next day

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:18.640
 and they worry about not being able to sleep

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.800
 and it can cascade into a whole set of things.

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:23.280
 So another thing that I do throughout my day

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.240
 is I know that early day I'm gonna be alert,

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:27.880
 afternoon I'm gonna be kind of sleepy.

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:30.120
 And then as the evening comes around,

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:32.480
 in addition to doing all the other things I'm doing,

1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:37.240
 I anticipate a peak in alertness and activity

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:38.840
 and I don't worry about it.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:41.080
 I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:42.960
 But basically I just go through,

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:45.260
 if I'm gonna do anything, it's gonna be very mundane tasks

1:06:45.260 --> 1:06:48.560
 like cleaning or things that require almost zero effort.

1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:51.680
 And that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too.

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:53.600
 But the fact of the matter is

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:56.680
 we don't just go drift off into sleep.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.680
 There's this blip of alertness right before sleep

1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:00.640
 that I hope just cognitively knowing about

1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:02.400
 will be helpful to people.

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:05.000
 And that raises yet another theme

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.280
 that I think is going to be very important,

1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:11.540
 which is physiological mechanisms

1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:15.440
 like these changes in alertness or using breathing tools,

1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:17.260
 something we'll talk about in future episodes,

1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:20.440
 to shift our levels of autonomic arousal.

1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:24.240
 Those are concrete biological phenomenon.

1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:25.520
 So is fasting.

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:27.000
 Fasting will increase alertness that way.

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.040
 So is caffeine, not everybody's susceptible to caffeine

1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:31.280
 to the same degree or others,

1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:33.360
 but it's a physiological mechanisms.

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:35.760
 We know the receptors, we know the ligands as they're called

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:37.160
 which bind to the receptors.

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:38.380
 We know the mechanisms,

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:40.920
 they involve cortisol and epinephrine.

1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:43.400
 Those are the sorts of things that I personally try

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:47.320
 and leverage toward my learning and optimization of my brain

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:48.820
 and my activity.

1:07:48.820 --> 1:07:51.560
 Doing physical activity early in the day, for instance,

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:54.480
 tends to give us a longer duration wake up signal

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:57.120
 and tends to accelerate waking up early in the day.

1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:58.480
 That's why working out late in the day

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:01.760
 can sometimes cause people to have trouble falling asleep.

1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:03.520
 It will also phase delay you make it

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:05.440
 so that you want to wake up later the next day.

1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:06.500
 It's not just because you're tired,

1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:07.700
 it's because you shifted your clock

1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:09.200
 with activity and temperature.

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:14.200
 Many people ask me about subjective tools for plasticity.

1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:16.480
 What about visualization?

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:19.720
 Can we just imagine doing a particular activity?

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:23.480
 Will that help us get better at that activity?

1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:26.120
 There are some evidence that visualization can do that.

1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:30.240
 It's true, but here's the important distinction

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:31.360
 and here's why I personally

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.900
 don't do much deliberate visualization.

1:08:33.900 --> 1:08:37.820
 First of all, I get my best ability

1:08:37.820 --> 1:08:39.880
 or achieve my best ability to visualize things

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.520
 when I'm in kind of a sleepy state.

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.160
 I don't know why, but that's when I'm able

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:46.560
 to direct my brain towards internal visualization

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:47.520
 with my eyes closed.

1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:50.040
 And generally I fall asleep and I can't remember anything

1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:51.660
 that I was thinking about before.

1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:54.840
 Some people, and these are work that was done many years ago

1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:57.940
 by Roger Shepherd and by others, Roger was at Stanford,

1:08:57.940 --> 1:09:00.680
 but in other labs have done this too, of course,

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:03.640
 of rotating objects physically in their mind

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:06.780
 as a way of improving or looking at the speed

1:09:06.780 --> 1:09:09.740
 of spatial calculations and so forth.

1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:14.000
 Some people are very good at visualization.

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000
 They can close their eyes and they can just see objects

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.920
 and rotate them deliberately, et cetera.

1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:21.520
 A lot of people like me, when we start doing that,

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:23.440
 our mind drifts too easily.

1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:25.920
 But I like to think I'm a reasonably focused person

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:28.580
 in the waking state.

1:09:28.580 --> 1:09:31.600
 So visualization has, it's interesting

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.140
 because I think people are very attracted to the idea

1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:35.540
 that they can just think about something

1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:37.040
 and then get better at it that way.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.040
 And it's probably true if you can be very linear

1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:43.640
 in the way that you visualize things.

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:44.460
 So I wanna repeat that.

1:09:44.460 --> 1:09:47.040
 I think visualization does have certain power

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:50.920
 if you can remain very linear and deliberate and focused

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:52.440
 in the visualization.

1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:55.200
 But many people like myself who are challenged

1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:59.320
 with maintaining that linear focus with eyes closed

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:01.080
 and in visualization,

1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:03.440
 they don't get much out of visualization.

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:06.520
 And I think the data on performance really supports that.

1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:09.000
 Now, there are examples where, for instance,

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.480
 people will injure one limb

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:13.600
 and then they will exercise the intact limb

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:15.600
 or the non-injured limb rather,

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.720
 and they will visualize the opposite limb.

1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:19.620
 Sometimes there's even the use of mirror boxes

1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:22.000
 so that let's say my left limb is injured,

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.100
 I'm maintaining activity with my right limb,

1:10:25.100 --> 1:10:26.200
 but I'm using a mirror box

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:28.480
 so it looks like my left limb is working well.

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.120
 Yes, there's some top-down or feedback mechanisms

1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:34.360
 that support the idea that the injured limb

1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:36.960
 can rehabilitate more quickly, et cetera.

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:39.700
 But those are fairly elaborate schemes.

1:10:39.700 --> 1:10:40.540
 These aren't the kinds,

1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:42.520
 I don't have mirror boxes around my house.

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:45.880
 I think these are specialized circumstances.

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:48.360
 They're a little bit like the examples

1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:49.520
 that we see in the news

1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:51.280
 where oh, so-and-so has a stroke

1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:53.560
 and then spontaneously speaks a new language.

1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:57.480
 I don't know what the answer to that is.

1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:00.180
 It shows that the brain has associative networks

1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:02.960
 that are typically suppressed and those can be unleashed,

1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:04.200
 but you certainly don't want to go out

1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.500
 and give yourself a stroke deliberately

1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:07.040
 to try and unmask some skill

1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:11.880
 because there's no concrete way to go about that

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.160
 in a way that you could really know

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:14.020
 that you were going to offset

1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:16.360
 the detrimental effects of the stroke.

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:18.320
 In fact, I think it'd be a terrible idea.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.320
 So I think what I'm trying to describe is how a typical,

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:24.320
 I don't know if I'm typical or normal.

1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:26.760
 I mean, I've been told otherwise.

1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:28.040
 It's certainly not normal.

1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:30.880
 But in terms of the way that I structure my day,

1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:32.640
 I think that's normal.

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:33.660
 That's pretty normal.

1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:35.800
 I tend to wake up right around, I don't know,

1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:38.000
 somewhere between 5.30 and 7 a.m.,

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.500
 depending on what I've been doing the night before.

1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:41.760
 I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10.30, 11.

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.540
 I tend to have one bout in the morning

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:45.880
 where I can do really focused, hard work

1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:48.920
 and I can really activate the go pathway

1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:51.240
 while also activating the no-go pathway

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:52.680
 so that I can really stay focused,

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:54.120
 but I rely on some tools.

1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:56.400
 I have a period in the afternoon where I get sleepy

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:58.500
 and kind of out of it like I think most people.

1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:00.480
 And I tend to come out of that

1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:02.620
 with recognizing the opportunity

1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:05.280
 of that slightly sleepy state for creative work

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.900
 and for thinking about things in novel ways.

1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:09.700
 I get light a couple times a day.

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:11.800
 I eat low carb during the day and I eat,

1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:16.160
 I don't say high, but higher carb, I eat starches

1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:19.160
 in the evening, so in a way I can sleep.

1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:21.920
 And then I really anticipate

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:24.700
 that late afternoon peak and alertness,

1:12:24.700 --> 1:12:27.280
 excuse me, late night peak and alertness

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:31.480
 that many people confuse for insomnia or challenges

1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:33.760
 when actually they're really quite normal

1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.600
 in their circadian cycle.

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:39.720
 And then I fall asleep and if all goes well,

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.000
 I stay asleep for four or five hours,

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.300
 typically it's three or four, and then I wake up.

1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:45.340
 I think I'm like most people,

1:12:45.340 --> 1:12:47.140
 I wake up during the middle of the night.

1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:49.500
 Now, one thing that I don't think has been discussed a lot,

1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:52.200
 but that one of my colleagues at the Stanford Sleep Lab

1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:54.920
 tells me is that every hour and a half or so,

1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:56.120
 we all wake up.

1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:58.280
 Some of you even look around, believe it or not,

1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:01.160
 and go right back to sleep and you don't recognize it.

1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:04.160
 Waking up periodically during sleep is the norm.

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:05.200
 It is not abnormal.

1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:08.360
 I don't know why this has been discussed more prominently.

1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:10.800
 I tend to wake up and if there's a bright light

1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:14.200
 coming through the blinds or if there's some noise upstairs,

1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:17.360
 if Costello's snoring particularly loud, I might get up,

1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:22.360
 I might go use the restroom, I might pick up a book

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.080
 and read under low light or something

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:25.800
 and then I generally fall back asleep

1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:28.320
 and wake up, typical time for me again,

1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:30.640
 5.30 to 7 a.m. in the morning.

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.600
 This waking up in the middle of the night thing,

1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:35.360
 as I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast episode today

1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:37.040
 is not necessarily abnormal.

1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:41.520
 What it probably reflects is that the real time,

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:43.600
 meaning the time that I should go to sleep

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:45.240
 is probably closer to eight o'clock.

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:48.560
 The word midnight was literally supposed to mean midnight.

1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:51.080
 We, many, meaning all of us,

1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:53.760
 were meant to go to sleep and wake up with the rise,

1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:56.360
 you know, with the setting and rising of the sun

1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:59.360
 and we know this because this beautiful study

1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:02.360
 from University of Colorado where they took people

1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:05.040
 out into the wilderness to reset their circadian clocks

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:08.200
 by way of, you know, measured by way of melatonin

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:10.660
 and cortisol and they had them,

1:14:10.660 --> 1:14:11.900
 they were completely out of whack

1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:13.220
 from interacting with screens

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:14.400
 and staying up too late, et cetera

1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:16.800
 and they basically had them view the sunrise

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.160
 and view the sunset each evening

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.840
 and almost all of them, not all of the students,

1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:23.080
 but all of them got onto a schedule

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.040
 where they naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset

1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:28.720
 and wake up around sunrise or just before sunrise,

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:30.000
 even when they were brought back

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.080
 into a normal artificial light setting.

1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:34.720
 So I think that's the natural pattern

1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:37.160
 and we've just deviated from it with artificial lights.

1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:40.520
 So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. doesn't necessarily mean

1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.840
 that there's something screwed up about you

1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:45.640
 or that, you know, you have anxiety or something,

1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:47.320
 although you might.

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.960
 What it likely means is that you were supposed

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.720
 to go to bed much earlier and because of this asymmetry

1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:54.400
 in the autonomic nervous system where it's much easier

1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:57.720
 for us to push and to delay our sleep time

1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:00.040
 than it is to accelerate our wake-up time.

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:03.040
 In other words, it's easier to stay up

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:04.120
 and hang out at the party,

1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.240
 even if you don't wanna be there than it is to wake up

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:09.240
 when you're exhausted and you're fast asleep.

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:11.440
 Most people are pushing through

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:13.680
 into the late hours of the evening and night

1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:14.760
 and going to bed much later

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.600
 than they naturally would want to.

1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:19.360
 And so I personally don't want to go to bed at 8 p.m.

1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:24.160
 A lot of good things happen between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.880
 And so I wanna enjoy those

1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:28.360
 and I push through the evening hours,

1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:31.160
 but as a consequence, I'm running out of melatonin.

1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.120
 My melatonin release is basically subsided

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.940
 by about 3 or 4 a.m. and so it makes sense

1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:37.260
 that I would wake up.

1:15:37.260 --> 1:15:39.200
 I don't take melatonin for reasons discussed

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:41.140
 in previous episodes.

1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:44.120
 I do rely on things like magnesium glycinate

1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:47.080
 or magnesium threonate, things like theanine.

1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:48.880
 I'm not saying any of you need to take those.

1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:50.160
 That's just what I happen to take

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:51.600
 in order to facilitate my sleep

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:53.760
 and it's been of great benefit to me.

1:15:54.900 --> 1:15:56.140
 If I wake up in the middle of the night

1:15:56.140 --> 1:15:59.040
 and I'm anxious for whatever reason and my mind is looping,

1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:00.320
 I have a couple rules.

1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:03.880
 One is I don't trust anything I think about

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:05.840
 when I wake up in the middle of the night, any of it.

1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:07.260
 Unless I've had a magnificent dream

1:16:07.260 --> 1:16:08.320
 and I wanna write it down,

1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:09.920
 I'll do that every once in a while.

1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:11.220
 Typically when I go back and read it,

1:16:11.220 --> 1:16:13.160
 it's not at all magnificent.

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:16.200
 I can't ever remember coming up

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:19.040
 with anything really fantastic in one of my dreams

1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:22.000
 that stuck with me or that I implemented.

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.060
 I don't really trust the kind of thinking that happens

1:16:24.060 --> 1:16:27.040
 in those wee hours of the circadian cycle for me.

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:30.400
 There's just nothing either for me terribly creative

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:33.420
 or worth linear implementation at that time.

1:16:33.420 --> 1:16:35.480
 But one thing that has been very helpful

1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:37.240
 is to sometimes do one of these

1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:38.960
 non-sleep deep rest protocols

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:40.960
 as a way to go back into sleep.

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:43.340
 So a hypnosis app by,

1:16:43.340 --> 1:16:44.920
 or some of the scripts by Michael Sealy

1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:46.300
 that I've mentioned before,

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:50.400
 or the Reverie Health or a Yoga Nidra protocol.

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:52.800
 Those for me have been very useful

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.660
 at helping me turn off kind of looping thinking

1:16:55.660 --> 1:16:58.320
 in the middle of the night and fall back asleep.

1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:01.140
 In reviewing my schedule for you,

1:17:01.140 --> 1:17:03.260
 just as a context for how to implement

1:17:03.260 --> 1:17:06.640
 certain types of tools for optimizing learning,

1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:08.440
 realize that it gives the impression

1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:10.760
 that there's a 90 minute bout of learning and work

1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:12.960
 in the morning and then a 90 minute bout

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.680
 of creative type work in the afternoon and that's it.

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:17.400
 There are a lot of hours in between of course

1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:19.160
 and I just wanna be very clear.

1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:21.720
 Those hours for me are occupied by pretty,

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:25.840
 not mundane tasks, but things that are kind of random.

1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:29.000
 Those are things like email or attending to Zoom meetings

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.680
 or meeting with colleagues and students

1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:33.240
 and things of that sort.

1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:37.120
 I sometimes will read just for sake of my own enrichment.

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:38.960
 I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:40.920
 because those are the two 90 minute bouts

1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:44.640
 where I'm trying to expand on the mental capacities

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:46.000
 that I already have.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.280
 They're really where I'm trying to stretch and grow

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:51.040
 what I'm able to do on a regular basis reflexively.

1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:53.080
 So I wanna emphasize that the whole day

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:56.080
 doesn't just consist of those two 90 minute bouts.

1:17:56.080 --> 1:17:57.440
 That's not the way my schedule works

1:17:57.440 --> 1:17:59.120
 and that's not the way my lifestyle is arranged,

1:17:59.120 --> 1:17:59.940
 which is fortunate

1:17:59.940 --> 1:18:01.640
 because I enjoy all those other things as well.

1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:04.000
 And so for many of you out there who are in school

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.280
 or who have a family demands or other demands,

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:09.680
 the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments

1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:13.300
 of about 90 minutes, one or two, or maybe more per day,

1:18:13.300 --> 1:18:15.560
 you're trying to slot those in wherever you can

1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:18.240
 amidst your other obligations

1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:19.860
 and things that you need to do.

1:18:19.860 --> 1:18:22.440
 But you wanna do that in an intelligent way

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.360
 that's anchored to your biology

1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:25.800
 and then you wanna do a number of things

1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:26.880
 which I've talked about today

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:28.840
 in order to optimize those sessions

1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:30.240
 to get the most out of them.

1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:34.780
 So as we round up, I acknowledge that once again,

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:37.080
 I've covered a huge range of topics

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:41.280
 related to how to optimize learning and brain change

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:43.840
 and essentially mental performance.

1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:45.560
 And I've set that in the context

1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:48.240
 of some biological mechanism like the basal ganglia,

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:51.760
 go-no-go pathways, the circadian autonomic system,

1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:55.920
 and some of the relationship between food and fasting

1:18:55.920 --> 1:18:59.060
 and particular types of food in alertness or sleepiness,

1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:03.000
 how linear focus and strategy implementation

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.440
 is best served by high alert states, although not too alert,

1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:07.920
 and how creative states,

1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:09.880
 at least the first phase of creativity,

1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:12.220
 which is the creative arrangement,

1:19:12.220 --> 1:19:14.200
 kind of brainstorming stage,

1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:17.360
 is supported by states of kind of relaxation

1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:18.720
 or even slightly sleepy,

1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:20.120
 but the creative implementation

1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.820
 is a very linear and focused and deliberate process,

1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:26.840
 much like the highly focused state that I described.

1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:28.560
 I described how I do these things,

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:29.880
 just to give you a context.

1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:31.920
 A lot of you asked for what I do

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:33.400
 in order to set it within a context,

1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:35.420
 but by no means are these rigid times

1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:36.640
 and ways of doing things,

1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:38.420
 but I think it's fair to say

1:19:38.420 --> 1:19:41.640
 that what I do has a circadian logic.

1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:45.180
 It also has grounding in biological mechanisms.

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:48.440
 They're very concrete that we know the cells and mechanisms

1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:49.720
 and neurotransmitters,

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:51.920
 and then some of them are a little bit headed out

1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:55.840
 into the what we would call kind of emerging,

1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:58.600
 or I don't want to say cutting edge,

1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:00.520
 but maybe front edge of what neuroscience

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:03.240
 is starting to understand about creativity and so forth.

1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:07.760
 Those are areas that are just now coming to some clarity,

1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:10.160
 and there's certainly still a lot more work to do.

1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:12.900
 A lot of different ways to arrange one's routine,

1:20:12.900 --> 1:20:15.800
 but hopefully the tools and practices that I described

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:17.800
 will be useful to you.

1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:20.000
 I want to mention that a lot of people ask me

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:23.420
 about specific tools and practices.

1:20:23.420 --> 1:20:25.840
 They ask me about Wim Hof breathing, about ice baths.

1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:27.960
 I've talked a little bit about ice baths before,

1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:29.440
 I think, and cold exposure,

1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:32.240
 about binaural beats and things of those sort.

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:35.440
 I think the way to look at any tool

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:37.960
 to modulate or measure the nervous system

1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:41.960
 is ask whether or not it's going to move you up or down

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:43.760
 the state of autonomic arousal,

1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:45.100
 whether or not it's going to make you more alert

1:20:45.100 --> 1:20:47.760
 or more calm, more focused or less focused.

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:49.560
 That's kind of the two axes here

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:51.360
 that we need to think about.

1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:53.220
 Sometimes you want to be more alert than you are,

1:20:53.220 --> 1:20:56.320
 and indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths,

1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:58.180
 super oxygenation, Wim Hof-type breathing

1:20:58.180 --> 1:21:00.400
 will bring your level of alertness up.

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:02.520
 There's some cautionary notes associated with each of those.

1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:04.960
 You need to read and understand those cautionary notes

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:06.820
 for yourself, everybody's different.

1:21:06.820 --> 1:21:09.680
 And some of those carry certain dangers

1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:11.140
 under certain conditions.

1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:13.100
 Others have huge margins for safety.

1:21:15.020 --> 1:21:17.200
 An ice bath generally wakes you up.

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:20.080
 A warmer hot bath generally calms you down, right?

1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:22.800
 Binaural beats, there aren't a lot of data

1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:24.340
 in quality peer-reviewed journals.

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.120
 I did put in the effort to go search it out.

1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:27.960
 There are a few.

1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:31.320
 Binaural beats are listening to frequencies of sound

1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:34.220
 that slightly differ or offset for the two ears.

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:37.080
 It has been shown, can shift the brain

1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:38.200
 into particular states.

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:40.240
 You'll notice today I didn't really talk about alpha

1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:41.900
 or theta or gamma rhythms.

1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:45.200
 I personally, in reviewing the literature,

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:47.280
 I don't think it's fair to say that alpha states

1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:50.640
 are great for X and theta states are great for Y.

1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:52.640
 And besides, most of us aren't walking around our homes

1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:54.900
 and our workplaces geared up to EEG machines

1:21:54.900 --> 1:21:56.240
 or with wires down below our skull,

1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:58.760
 so we don't know when we're in those states anyway.

1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:02.560
 I think the subjective reading of whether or not one

1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:06.520
 is alert or calm and whether or not that alertness

1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:09.560
 or calmness matches the goal or the thing

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:11.780
 that we're trying to achieve in terms of learning,

1:22:11.780 --> 1:22:16.680
 including sleep, is the most valuable internal tool

1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:18.220
 and recognition that we can all have.

1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:20.040
 In other words, if I want to be very alert

1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:22.180
 and I need to be very alert and I'm exhausted,

1:22:22.180 --> 1:22:24.440
 there might be tools that I should use to wake up.

1:22:24.440 --> 1:22:27.040
 It might also speak to the fact that I might not have slept

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.240
 as well as I could have or should have the night before.

1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:32.120
 So it's really about a match between where we are

1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:33.840
 on that autonomic arousal scale

1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:36.320
 and what we're trying to achieve.

1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:38.400
 And indeed, there are going to be a lot of tools,

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:40.720
 including supplements and other prescription drugs

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:42.500
 and things that can help move us along

1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:45.820
 that autonomic continuum up toward more alertness

1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:47.600
 or toward more calmness.

1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:50.680
 But ultimately, it's about tailoring that alertness

1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:53.040
 and calmness to the specific types of learning

1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:55.960
 and activities that you are going to do and perform.

1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:59.540
 And it's reciprocal, meaning some of those activities

1:22:59.540 --> 1:23:02.200
 like exercise early in the day will increase your level

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:04.440
 of autonomic arousal and alertness.

1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:07.280
 Certain foods will tend to wake you up.

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:09.320
 Certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy.

1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:11.720
 And the volume of food and the timing of food

1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:12.920
 is a factor also.

1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:14.720
 So it's a huge parameter space.

1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:17.360
 It's a huge set of variables that impacts whether or not

1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:18.880
 we're feeling well, performing well,

1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:21.040
 learning great or not learning great.

1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:24.120
 And the key thing is to become an observer

1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:26.520
 of your own system and what works for you.

1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:29.900
 And to recognize that there are two bins of tools

1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:33.160
 for optimizing learning and brain performance.

1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:35.400
 One are tools that are really anchored

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:36.720
 in biological mechanism.

1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:38.600
 And we are certain of what those are.

1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:39.600
 I've talked about some of those.

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.140
 The other, the more subjective tools.

1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:45.060
 For some of you, visualization might work terrifically well.

1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:47.560
 For some of you, one song might really wake you up

1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:49.680
 because of the associations you have with it.

1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:53.280
 And for me, it might repel me from the room

1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:55.960
 because I don't like it or it might put me to sleep.

1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:58.720
 But of course, volume is kind of a universal.

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:00.340
 Loud music tends to wake people up.

1:24:00.340 --> 1:24:03.400
 Soft music doesn't tend to wake them up quite as much.

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:07.080
 So part of today is really getting you to think about

1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:09.620
 in a scientific way, in a structured way,

1:24:09.620 --> 1:24:13.560
 about the non-negotiable elements,

1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.320
 which are that you're going to have a period

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.620
 of every 24 hour cycle when you tend to be more awake

1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:19.280
 and a period when you tend to be more asleep

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:20.560
 and how to leverage those

1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:22.400
 so you're not fighting an uphill battle

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:26.080
 to wake up when you actually would want to be

1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:29.360
 and should be sleepy and not trying to go to sleep

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:32.960
 when you are naturally going to be most awake.

1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:34.660
 So a lot of it is really anchors back

1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:36.600
 to those core mechanisms of biology.

1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:38.680
 And then you start layering on the different protocols

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:40.880
 of food and supplementation, et cetera.

1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.520
 And I think it's important to recognize

1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:46.040
 that some people are just more go, go, go, go, go,

1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:50.120
 and no go, and some people are just calmer

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:52.800
 and have a harder time getting into action and an activity.

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:54.340
 It's just the way that we're wired.

1:24:54.340 --> 1:24:56.040
 Some of us have autonomic nervous systems

1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:59.320
 that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states.

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.520
 One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog,

1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:04.460
 is that they are very calm animals.

1:25:04.460 --> 1:25:06.920
 In fact, they make no spontaneous movements

1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:08.960
 unless there's something to respond to.

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.140
 And I find that incredibly relaxing.

1:25:11.140 --> 1:25:12.700
 Other animals like pit bulls,

1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:15.020
 who I also really like and enjoy and other species,

1:25:15.020 --> 1:25:16.280
 their tail's always wagging

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:17.800
 and that they're always in a position

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:19.800
 to make a movement at any second

1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:20.680
 because they tend to ride

1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:22.980
 at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal.

1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:24.600
 They pop up really quickly

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.480
 when you say it's time to go for a walk.

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:30.000
 Costello does it one limb at a time

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.880
 and sometimes he just goes back to sleep.

1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:34.280
 And so there are people like that too.

1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:35.980
 And so you have to know where you are

1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:38.540
 and what particular goals you're trying to pursue.

1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:42.280
 As a final closure to this,

1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:45.280
 I want to emphasize that today, as always,

1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:47.020
 I've strived to be accurate.

1:25:47.020 --> 1:25:49.200
 I'm sure if I made mistakes, some of you will point it out

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.200
 and I appreciate that and I'll post a correction

1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:56.220
 if we agree that I indeed misspoke or missighted something.

1:25:57.120 --> 1:25:59.920
 But by no means was I exhaustive.

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:01.480
 I mean, I might've exhausted some of you,

1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:03.680
 but the information wasn't exhaustive.

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:05.960
 Meaning there's no way that I could cover

1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:08.600
 all the ways in which we optimize

1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:11.020
 or can optimize learning and performance.

1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:12.680
 I think we've touched on a number of them

1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:15.120
 that I hope that you'll find value in

1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:17.320
 and that you'll explore in your own lives.

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:19.880
 We are continuing with this theme

1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:21.800
 because that's what we do for this podcast.

1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:24.020
 We stay on one theme for an entire month.

1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:25.280
 For the next episode,

1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:29.040
 we're going to explore two very essential aspects

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:31.320
 of neuroplasticity that actually relate

1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:33.880
 to learning, which are pain,

1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:37.800
 pain management and neural regeneration.

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:40.600
 And for those of you that don't have injuries

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:42.680
 or don't suffer from chronic pain,

1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:45.440
 the discussion is still going to be a very important one

1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:47.400
 because it's not just going to be about pain

1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:48.440
 that you're trying to get rid of.

1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:51.500
 It's also going to be about how certain sensory experiences

1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:55.060
 within the pain network can become amplified

1:26:55.060 --> 1:26:57.600
 as well as how we can use top-down modulation.

1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:01.520
 We can use our mind to suppress the pain response.

1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:02.360
 We're also going to talk about

1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:05.320
 some of the hardwired mechanisms that are bottom-up

1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:09.160
 that exist in our periphery, in our body to control pain.

1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:10.720
 And we're also going to discuss

1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:12.280
 a number of interesting interactions

1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:15.020
 between the pain system and the learning system.

1:27:15.020 --> 1:27:19.180
 So again, if you're not interested in pain per se,

1:27:19.180 --> 1:27:22.100
 it still is going to be a very valid conversation

1:27:22.100 --> 1:27:25.320
 for sake of understanding how to optimize brain performance.

1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:27.500
 And neural regeneration goes hand in hand

1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:28.920
 with that discussion.

1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:30.680
 So I hope you'll join us for that.

1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:33.800
 I suppose I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:37.520
 that Costello has been snoring extremely loudly today.

1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:39.760
 You know, a good long walk this morning,

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:41.720
 which means up the driveway, down the driveway.

1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:42.860
 He's an old dog.

1:27:42.860 --> 1:27:44.560
 So if you've been hearing him in the background

1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:46.800
 and it's been distracting, now you know why.

1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:49.120
 It probably relates to where you were

1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:51.240
 on your level of autonomic arousal.

1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:52.640
 And I'll leave it to you to answer

1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:54.840
 that question for yourself.

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.400
 Many of you continue to graciously ask

1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:59.440
 how you can help support the podcast.

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:01.400
 We really appreciate the question.

1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:03.640
 The best way is to subscribe wherever it is

1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:05.220
 you happen to be listening or watching.

1:28:05.220 --> 1:28:07.320
 So for those of you that it's YouTube,

1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:09.440
 please subscribe to the YouTube channel.

1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:12.160
 If it's Apple, subscribe to the podcast on Apple,

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.680
 or if it's Spotify, subscribe there.

1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:15.500
 Maybe you subscribe to all three.

1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:17.320
 If you have comments and feedback for us,

1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:20.940
 suggestions for future podcast episodes or topics to cover,

1:28:20.940 --> 1:28:24.400
 please place those in the comment section on YouTube.

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:26.020
 Apple also provides a section

1:28:26.020 --> 1:28:27.960
 where you can give us a rating.

1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:29.560
 We would love it if you gave us a five-star rating

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.080
 or whatever it is that you feel that we deserve.

1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:35.960
 And in general, if you could tell people about the podcast,

1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:37.260
 we hope that you would tell them

1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:38.420
 because you think the information

1:28:38.420 --> 1:28:39.920
 would be of use to them, of course.

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:42.840
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your coworkers,

1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:44.940
 because as we expand the podcast,

1:28:44.940 --> 1:28:47.520
 the support for the podcast just grows along with it.

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:49.560
 So that's a terrific way to support us.

1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:51.360
 As always, check out our sponsors,

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:53.240
 which were mentioned at the beginning.

1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:56.320
 And in addition to that, we've now set up a Patreon account.

1:28:56.320 --> 1:28:57.920
 Some of you asked specifically

1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:59.400
 how you can help support the podcast,

1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:01.620
 but you weren't interested in our sponsors

1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:03.920
 or you were already engaged with our sponsors.

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:05.640
 So we have a Patreon account.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:09.540
 You can find it at patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:14.960
 Finally, in previous episodes today and in future episodes,

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:16.480
 I mentioned supplements.

1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.600
 Supplements are one way, certainly not the only way,

1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:22.280
 but they're one way in which we can modulate

1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:25.160
 our nervous system for sake of better sleep,

1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:28.920
 learning, alertness, and several other things as well.

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:30.320
 If you're interested in supplements,

1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:33.960
 we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.800
 because Thorne supplements have very high stringency

1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:38.880
 in terms of what's in the bottle,

1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:40.220
 the amounts of the substances

1:29:40.220 --> 1:29:43.180
 that are in each capsule or pill, et cetera.

1:29:43.180 --> 1:29:45.580
 And they have partnered with other groups

1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:47.960
 such as the Mayo Clinic, all the major sports teams.

1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:50.000
 So there's very high rigor associated with Thorne,

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.160
 which is why we've decided to partner with them.

1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:53.840
 If you'd like to check out Thorne supplements

1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:55.520
 and see the supplements that I take,

1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:58.520
 you can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:29:58.520 --> 1:30:01.720
 dot com slash U slash Huberman,

1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:03.520
 and you'll see a list of some of the supplements

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:04.660
 that I take.

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:08.320
 As well, you'll get 20% off any of the supplements

1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:10.980
 listed there as well as anywhere else on the Thorne website.

1:30:10.980 --> 1:30:13.520
 So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:16.760
 dot com slash U slash Huberman

1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:19.880
 for 20% off any Thorne supplements.

1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:23.920
 Last but not least, on behalf of me and Costello,

1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:26.280
 I want to thank you for your time and attention today.

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:29.480
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:51.480
 And as always, thank you for your time and attention today.
