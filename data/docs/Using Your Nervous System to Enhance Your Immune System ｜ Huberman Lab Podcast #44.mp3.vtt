00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.360 --> 00:13.040
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.040 --> 00:15.280
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.220
 Today, we are discussing the immune system,

00:18.220 --> 00:20.600
 and we are also discussing the nervous system,

00:20.600 --> 00:22.120
 which is the brain, spinal cord,

00:22.120 --> 00:23.960
 and the connections of the brain and spinal cord

00:23.960 --> 00:25.720
 with all the organs of the body.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.240
 We are also going to discuss how the nervous system

00:29.240 --> 00:33.680
 can be used to activate and control the immune system.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.920
 Now, about 10, 20 years ago,

00:35.920 --> 00:38.020
 if somebody said that the mind

00:38.020 --> 00:40.040
 could control the immune system,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.920
 it'd probably get laughed out of most academic conferences,

00:42.920 --> 00:44.520
 and certainly the work wouldn't be published

00:44.520 --> 00:45.520
 in quality journals.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.000
 But nowadays, there are dozens, if not hundreds,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.520
 of quality peer-reviewed studies

00:51.520 --> 00:54.660
 on how the mind and how the nervous system

00:54.660 --> 00:58.200
 can control activation of the immune system.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.800
 This is a wonderful growing body of research.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.400
 And just to give you a hint

01:02.400 --> 01:04.180
 of where we are headed with this,

01:04.180 --> 01:05.760
 just this last week,

01:05.760 --> 01:07.920
 there was a paper published in Nature,

01:07.920 --> 01:11.040
 which is the apex journal for scientific publishing,

01:11.040 --> 01:13.720
 premier journal, extremely stringent.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.480
 A paper published in Nature from Chufu Ma's lab

01:17.480 --> 01:19.200
 at Harvard Medical School

01:19.200 --> 01:24.200
 explored how acupuncture can reduce inflammation in the body

01:24.560 --> 01:28.080
 and I will describe this study in a bit more detail later,

01:28.080 --> 01:32.660
 but what they discovered was that by stimulating the body

01:32.660 --> 01:36.440
 in particular ways at particular sites on the body,

01:36.440 --> 01:41.000
 they were able to liberate certain cells and molecules

01:41.000 --> 01:43.920
 that enhance the function of the immune system

01:43.920 --> 01:45.200
 and potentially can be used

01:45.200 --> 01:47.560
 to combat different types of infection.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.600
 And just to give you another little hint,

01:49.600 --> 01:53.280
 they found that a particular type of organ tissue

01:53.280 --> 01:55.580
 called fascia, some of you may have heard of fascia,

01:55.580 --> 01:57.940
 fascia surrounds our muscles,

01:57.940 --> 01:58.780
 just to look at it,

01:58.780 --> 02:00.340
 you might think it's a kind of useless tissue,

02:00.340 --> 02:02.120
 it's sort of like a dense bag

02:02.120 --> 02:04.000
 in which the muscles are contained.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.100
 Well, it turns out that those dense bags

02:06.100 --> 02:07.400
 are much smarter than we thought,

02:07.400 --> 02:08.580
 they don't have a mind of their own,

02:08.580 --> 02:10.860
 but by stimulating the fascia

02:10.860 --> 02:13.280
 in a particular location on the body,

02:13.280 --> 02:16.500
 there's a pathway leading out of that fascia

02:16.500 --> 02:20.400
 directly to an organ called the adrenal medulla,

02:20.400 --> 02:21.600
 I'll explain what all this means,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.280
 that could liberate particular chemicals

02:23.280 --> 02:26.940
 that had a potent anti-inflammatory effect.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.400
 So what we're basically saying

02:28.400 --> 02:31.800
 is that the nervous system acts as a set of highways

02:31.800 --> 02:33.800
 between the different tissues of your body,

02:33.800 --> 02:36.360
 calling into action the immune system,

02:36.360 --> 02:38.000
 liberating particular molecules

02:38.000 --> 02:42.360
 that can reduce inflammation and lead to faster healing.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.400
 And I will explain how all of that works

02:44.400 --> 02:47.660
 as well as some other non-acupuncture methods

02:47.660 --> 02:49.680
 for activating and enhancing

02:49.680 --> 02:51.000
 the function of the immune system.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.220
 So today we're going to be talking

02:52.220 --> 02:55.120
 all about healing with the mind

02:55.120 --> 02:59.040
 in a completely non-mystical, non-abstract sense.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.080
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

03:01.080 --> 03:02.580
 that this podcast is separate

03:02.580 --> 03:04.900
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.160
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:07.160 --> 03:09.220
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

03:09.220 --> 03:11.540
 about science and science-related tools

03:11.540 --> 03:13.040
 to the general public.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.240
 In keeping with that theme,

03:14.240 --> 03:17.260
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.560
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.940
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:21.940 --> 03:24.880
 that are absolute superb quality.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.260
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.680
 And I can tell you that one of the major issues

03:29.680 --> 03:31.800
 our visual system has to contend with

03:31.800 --> 03:35.000
 is how to see things clearly in bright environments

03:35.000 --> 03:37.440
 or dimmer environments, et cetera.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.100
 Roca clearly understands the science of the visual system

03:40.100 --> 03:42.360
 because one thing that's wonderful about their sunglasses

03:42.360 --> 03:45.040
 is that you can be in a very bright environment

03:45.040 --> 03:47.040
 and then walk into a shadowed environment

03:47.040 --> 03:48.860
 and you don't even notice the transition.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.620
 Everything is still seen with crystal clarity.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.980
 Their eyeglasses as well allow you to see things

03:54.980 --> 03:58.740
 regardless of how bright or dim internal lighting is.

03:58.740 --> 03:59.780
 I wear readers at night.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.420
 I wear sunglasses during the day.

04:01.420 --> 04:04.300
 And Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are particularly nice

04:04.300 --> 04:05.960
 because they're very lightweight.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.480
 I often forget that they're even on my face.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.820
 They also don't slip off if you get sweaty.

04:10.820 --> 04:12.580
 They were actually designed to be used

04:12.580 --> 04:14.220
 while running or cycling.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.900
 And so I can use them while exercising.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.100
 They also have a great aesthetic.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.220
 So you can go from exercising to dinner or to work

04:20.220 --> 04:22.260
 without having to change from one set of glasses

04:22.260 --> 04:23.540
 to the next.

04:23.540 --> 04:25.040
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

04:25.040 --> 04:26.740
 you can go to roca.com.

04:26.740 --> 04:29.700

04:32.280 --> 04:35.820
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.620
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:37.620 --> 04:40.060
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.780
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.660
 And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.660
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

04:47.660 --> 04:49.280
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

04:49.280 --> 04:51.820
 once or twice per day is because it allows me

04:51.820 --> 04:54.460
 to cover all of my basic nutritional bases.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.580
 It's got the vitamins and minerals

04:56.580 --> 04:59.060
 that make sure that no matter what I'm eating,

04:59.060 --> 05:01.420
 I'm covering all of my micronutrient bases.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.060
 And it has the probiotics.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.820
 And probiotics, we now know,

05:04.820 --> 05:06.980
 are essential for a healthy gut microbiome.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.180
 And a healthy gut microbiome, we know,

05:09.180 --> 05:12.340
 is essential for many important biological functions

05:12.340 --> 05:15.060
 related to human health, like metabolic needs,

05:15.060 --> 05:17.800
 endocrine function, immune function, and so on.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.040
 With Athletic Greens, I can mix that up with water.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.180
 I usually add some lemon or lime juice.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.300
 It tastes delicious.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.140
 I like it very much,

05:24.140 --> 05:25.780
 and I'll drink it once early in the day,

05:25.780 --> 05:28.040
 and once again later in the afternoon.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.420
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:30.420 --> 05:33.220
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.620
 And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.260
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

05:37.260 --> 05:39.380
 which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens,

05:39.380 --> 05:42.300
 whether you're in the car or on a plane or on the move,

05:42.300 --> 05:46.180
 and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.260
 There is now a lot of data showing that vitamin D3

05:49.260 --> 05:51.580
 is important for many biological functions

05:51.580 --> 05:53.860
 that impact our immediate and long-term health,

05:53.860 --> 05:56.240
 and most people do not get enough vitamin D3,

05:56.240 --> 05:57.820
 even if they're getting a lot of sunshine.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.100
 And K2 is also important,

06:00.100 --> 06:03.120
 or has been shown to be important for heart health

06:03.120 --> 06:05.420
 and for blood lipid function, et cetera.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.460
 So again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

06:07.460 --> 06:10.540
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:10.540 --> 06:12.960
 to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

06:12.960 --> 06:15.820
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:15.820 --> 06:19.140
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.700
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:21.700 --> 06:24.520
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:24.520 --> 06:26.100
 to help you better meet your immediate

06:26.100 --> 06:28.060
 and long-term health goals.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.980
 I've long been a fan of getting regular blood work done

06:30.980 --> 06:33.560
 for the simple reason that many of the things

06:33.560 --> 06:35.900
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:35.900 --> 06:38.500
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.940
 There's just simply no other body surface marker

06:41.940 --> 06:43.860
 that you can look at somebody or yourself and say,

06:43.860 --> 06:47.240
 ah, I know that my blood lipids or my cholesterol are good,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.540
 or that my hormone levels are X, Y, or Z.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.240
 We really need numbers on those things

06:51.240 --> 06:53.260
 to know where they sit.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.180
 The problem with a lot of blood tests, however,

06:55.180 --> 06:56.700
 is you get all those numbers back.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.760
 You don't know what to do with that information.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.340
 Inside Tracker has solved that problem.

07:00.340 --> 07:03.460
 They have a very easy to use dashboard

07:03.460 --> 07:05.900
 where when you get your numbers back,

07:05.900 --> 07:07.460
 it can tell you, for instance,

07:07.460 --> 07:10.220
 where your numbers are high or low or on target,

07:10.220 --> 07:14.420
 and they can suggest very specific dietary interventions,

07:14.420 --> 07:17.260
 supplemental interventions, and behavioral interventions

07:17.260 --> 07:19.020
 that can allow you to bring those numbers

07:19.020 --> 07:20.380
 to where you would like them to be.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.960
 So they've simplified the whole process.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.500
 And in terms of getting the blood tests,

07:23.500 --> 07:25.580
 you can go to a local center to get the blood drawn,

07:25.580 --> 07:27.300
 or they can even send somebody to your house.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.980
 They've made the whole thing very, very easy

07:28.980 --> 07:30.440
 from start to finish.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.320
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:32.320 --> 07:35.420
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:35.420 --> 07:38.700
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.640
 You just use the code Huberman at checkout.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.380
 Okay, let's talk about the immune system

07:44.380 --> 07:47.260
 and the nervous system and how the two interact

07:47.260 --> 07:49.720
 and how you can control your immune system

07:49.720 --> 07:51.700
 to serve you better.

07:51.700 --> 07:55.380
 We are going to talk a lot of mechanistic science,

07:55.380 --> 07:56.240
 a little bit of detail.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.500
 You learned some new language around the immune system,

07:59.500 --> 08:01.300
 names of the different cell types and so forth,

08:01.300 --> 08:03.180
 but I promise to make it all very clear

08:03.180 --> 08:04.900
 regardless of your background.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.400
 We are also going to discuss a lot of tools.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.160
 And I think many of you are probably here

08:09.160 --> 08:11.060
 because you want to know what you can do

08:11.060 --> 08:13.460
 in order to boost or enhance the function

08:13.460 --> 08:14.560
 of your immune system.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.580
 That's a very reasonable question to ask.

08:18.940 --> 08:21.860
 I want to begin by just acknowledging that

08:21.860 --> 08:24.640
 if one were to put that question into the internet,

08:24.640 --> 08:27.200
 you would get back a lot of answers.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.620
 And there is now a sort of generic form of that answer

08:30.620 --> 08:32.460
 that deserves our respect,

08:32.460 --> 08:35.340
 but is not going to be the topic of conversation today.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.620
 I just want to tip my hat to it, however,

08:38.620 --> 08:41.800
 and list off a few of the things that we know

08:41.800 --> 08:44.940
 set us up to be healthier than we would be

08:44.940 --> 08:45.900
 if we didn't do these things.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.020
 So the first of course,

08:47.020 --> 08:49.100
 is the foundation of all mental and physical health,

08:49.100 --> 08:52.300
 which is to get adequate sleep, meaning enough sleep,

08:52.300 --> 08:55.500
 whatever it is for you that you require to get deep sleep.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.340
 So it's got to be of high quality

08:57.340 --> 08:59.620
 and to time that sleep correctly,

08:59.620 --> 09:01.280
 meaning you can't sleep during the day one day

09:01.280 --> 09:02.220
 and at night the next day

09:02.220 --> 09:04.060
 and expect your system to function well.

09:04.060 --> 09:05.840
 Talked a lot about that before on this podcast,

09:05.840 --> 09:08.620
 you need a relatively consistent sleep schedule

09:08.620 --> 09:11.480
 most of the time, about 80% of the time,

09:11.480 --> 09:13.360
 or even better would be 90% of the time.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.060
 But the realities of life make it that

09:16.060 --> 09:18.020
 we can't always go to bed at the same time

09:18.020 --> 09:20.140
 and wake up at the exact same time, okay?

09:20.140 --> 09:21.540
 So we need sleep.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.700
 We do need sunshine.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.700
 Why do we need sunshine?

09:23.700 --> 09:26.820
 Because it sets our rhythm into a regular state

09:26.820 --> 09:29.540
 where the genes in all of our cells

09:29.540 --> 09:31.260
 can be expressed at the correct times.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.340
 We're sort of a factory of cells, if you will,

09:33.340 --> 09:35.060
 and that factory can only run properly

09:35.060 --> 09:37.980
 if it knows when certain things should be active

09:37.980 --> 09:40.300
 and when certain cells should not be active.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.840
 And the best way to coordinate all of those activities

09:42.840 --> 09:45.700
 of all the cells is to get sunshine in your eyes

09:45.700 --> 09:47.940
 in the morning and again in the evening

09:47.940 --> 09:50.180
 and not to get too much bright light in your eyes

09:50.180 --> 09:51.540
 in the middle of the night.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.860
 That's just foundational.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.860
 And then any lists that you'll find

09:55.860 --> 09:58.220
 on any number of websites on the internet would say,

09:58.220 --> 10:03.040
 okay, get good sleep, get sun, get exercise,

10:03.040 --> 10:04.160
 how much exercise?

10:04.160 --> 10:06.660
 We should all be getting 150 to 180 minutes

10:06.660 --> 10:08.420
 of zone two cardio.

10:08.420 --> 10:10.440
 That's cardiovascular exercise

10:10.440 --> 10:12.820
 where we can just barely hold a conversation

10:12.820 --> 10:15.480
 or maybe not per week.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.660
 We should be eating well.

10:16.660 --> 10:19.240
 We're always told we have to get good nutrition.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.660
 What good nutrition means to you is going to be different

10:21.660 --> 10:22.940
 than what it means to somebody else.

10:22.940 --> 10:26.460
 But we acknowledge that food intake

10:26.460 --> 10:28.600
 and quality of food in particular,

10:28.600 --> 10:31.260
 avoiding processed foods, that's going to be important.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.680
 Social connection is important.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.860
 Hydration is important.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.660
 You're starting to get the picture.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.860
 We can take all that, acknowledge it as useful

10:40.860 --> 10:43.640
 and foundational for mental and physical health.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.100
 But of course, there are many people who still struggle

10:46.100 --> 10:51.100
 with getting ill too often or with not being able to heal

10:51.500 --> 10:53.660
 from physical injuries and wounds

10:53.660 --> 10:56.900
 or from various bacterial and viral infections

10:56.900 --> 10:59.180
 quickly enough or deal with chronic disease.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.740
 And so today is really about how you can take all

11:01.740 --> 11:05.020
 of that information, acknowledge it and follow it.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.900
 But in addition to that, there are things that you can do

11:07.900 --> 11:10.220
 to leverage your nervous system in order

11:10.220 --> 11:12.860
 to enhance the function of your immune system

11:12.860 --> 11:14.760
 in very robust ways.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.380
 So that's where I'd like to shift the conversation to.

11:17.380 --> 11:21.060
 The first topic we have to attack is the question

11:21.060 --> 11:23.760
 of what is the immune system and how does it work?

11:23.760 --> 11:27.140
 I think many of you have heard of antibodies

11:27.140 --> 11:30.500
 or killer cells or the various organs of the body

11:30.500 --> 11:32.780
 that are involved in the immune system like the bone marrow,

11:32.780 --> 11:35.220
 the spleen, the thymus and the lymph nodes.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.380
 I'd like to just take a moment

11:37.380 --> 11:42.380
 and do a sort of brief immune system 101.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.780
 Really simple, cover the basic elements of the immune system

11:45.780 --> 11:49.120
 so that everyone listening or watching this

11:49.120 --> 11:52.660
 can get a clear sense of how the immune system functions

11:52.660 --> 11:55.160
 and what its basic parts are.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.340
 For some of you, this might be too basic.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.940
 It might be a little bit of background

11:58.940 --> 11:59.960
 that you already know.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.540
 I think for most of you, this information will be new.

12:02.540 --> 12:05.340
 And I promise you, you don't need a biology

12:05.340 --> 12:07.260
 or medicine background in order to understand this.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.540
 It's actually really simple

12:09.540 --> 12:12.540
 because it is truly elegant in design.

12:12.540 --> 12:17.540
 You have three main layers of defense for your health.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.580
 These are the three things that are constantly at work

12:21.580 --> 12:25.540
 to protect you from invasion and illness,

12:25.540 --> 12:30.240
 from bacteria, from viruses and from parasites.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.140
 And the first of those three is a physical barrier

12:34.140 --> 12:36.100
 that we call your skin.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.460
 And that might seem kind of obvious,

12:37.460 --> 12:42.300
 but everything about you is contained in this compartment

12:42.300 --> 12:45.300
 that is boundaried by your skin.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.100
 And your skin is a very important aspect

12:48.100 --> 12:49.780
 of your immune system.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.080
 If you've ever had a cut,

12:51.080 --> 12:53.900
 you essentially have a breach of the boundary

12:53.900 --> 12:55.840
 that is your immune system.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.960
 And you would notice a number of things would happen.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.220
 You might get some swelling around that cut.

13:01.220 --> 13:02.740
 You might get a scab.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.520
 Likely you would get a scab over time.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.860
 If it got dirty, there were some bacteria that got in there.

13:07.860 --> 13:10.100
 You might see some accumulation of white blood cells,

13:10.100 --> 13:10.920
 what's called pus.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.220
 I know it's kind of gross, but that's what that is.

13:13.220 --> 13:15.020
 It might take on a yellow tint

13:15.020 --> 13:18.060
 because of the accumulation of some dead cells there.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.720
 But basically your skin is the primary barrier

13:20.720 --> 13:23.140
 through which you keep things from the outside

13:23.140 --> 13:26.900
 that could harm you from getting to the inside.

13:26.900 --> 13:30.600
 Now, still in category one,

13:30.600 --> 13:32.780
 your body and your external surface,

13:32.780 --> 13:36.300
 you have openings to that surface, right?

13:36.300 --> 13:40.940
 You're not just a round or a body shaped,

13:40.940 --> 13:43.460
 completely covered up with skin, you have openings.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.300
 What are those openings?

13:44.300 --> 13:47.140
 Well, let's start at the top and work our way down.

13:47.140 --> 13:51.100
 A primary site of potential infection are your eyes.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.980
 You have your ears, you have your nostrils,

13:52.980 --> 13:54.100
 you have your mouth, okay?

13:54.100 --> 13:56.200
 Those are going to be the primary sites

13:56.200 --> 13:58.900
 by which things can get into your system.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.260
 And you need to put things into your system.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.300
 You need to drink and eat

14:01.300 --> 14:02.820
 and you need to get light into your system.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.620
 That's why you have those openings.

14:04.620 --> 14:07.780
 But bad things, meaning things that can harm you,

14:07.780 --> 14:10.100
 can get into those systems.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.540
 And then of course, along the back of your throat,

14:14.780 --> 14:18.180
 all the way down to your stomach and your digestive system

14:18.180 --> 14:20.260
 and through your intestines and out your rectum,

14:20.260 --> 14:24.400
 you have a tube that you are basically a series of tubes.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.780
 I've said that before in this podcast,

14:25.780 --> 14:28.460
 and this is one such tube by which you extract nutrients

14:28.460 --> 14:30.140
 from the outside environment.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.460
 But all along that tube,

14:32.460 --> 14:37.140
 including your nose and your mouth, it's lined with mucus.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.320
 And while mucus might seem kind of gross to some of you,

14:39.320 --> 14:40.380
 the more you learn about mucus,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.420
 the more you realize that mucus is really, really cool

14:43.420 --> 14:46.140
 because mucus essentially acts as a filter,

14:46.140 --> 14:49.420
 as a trap for bacteria and viruses.

14:49.420 --> 14:53.380
 And it has certain ways of scrubbing or killing

14:53.380 --> 14:55.980
 those bacteria and viruses.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.860
 Now, the mucus is constantly being turned over.

14:58.860 --> 15:00.060
 As we'll talk about later,

15:00.060 --> 15:03.120
 the chemistry of that mucus is really important

15:03.120 --> 15:06.060
 in order to make sure that certain things

15:06.060 --> 15:07.180
 don't make it into your system

15:07.180 --> 15:09.400
 and other things are allowed to move through your system

15:09.400 --> 15:11.540
 and you can extract nutrients from them.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.680
 So the reason I'm talking about this first category

15:14.680 --> 15:17.440
 of a barrier for immune system in such detail

15:17.440 --> 15:21.140
 is I'd like you to envision yourself as a human, of course,

15:21.140 --> 15:25.500
 but as a human that is a clear entity from everything else,

15:25.500 --> 15:26.920
 and you have to bring in the right things

15:26.920 --> 15:29.860
 and you have to keep out the wrong things or kill them.

15:30.860 --> 15:34.500
 Now, inevitably, bacteria, viruses,

15:34.500 --> 15:38.220
 and parasitic infections are going to make their way

15:38.220 --> 15:39.540
 into our body.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.560
 But whether or not they are killed off

15:41.560 --> 15:44.540
 or whether or not they take over and cause us harm

15:44.540 --> 15:48.060
 is going to be determined by layers two and three.

15:48.060 --> 15:51.260
 So layers two and three are the so-called

15:51.260 --> 15:54.620
 innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.340
 So the innate immune system

15:56.340 --> 15:58.340
 is what I would call the second layer of defense.

15:58.340 --> 15:59.460
 It's very fast.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.880
 So whether or not it's bacteria, virus, or parasite,

16:02.880 --> 16:06.880
 what happens when you have something enter your body,

16:06.880 --> 16:09.380
 maybe you swallowed it, maybe it got in through your eyes,

16:09.380 --> 16:12.020
 maybe you shook somebody's hand

16:12.020 --> 16:14.540
 who is carrying a particular kind of illness,

16:14.540 --> 16:16.200
 and then you wiped your eyes.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.820
 And I've talked about on this podcast before,

16:17.820 --> 16:19.860
 very soon after we meet another person,

16:19.860 --> 16:22.200
 usually within 30 seconds, believe it or not,

16:22.200 --> 16:24.660
 most people wipe that person's chemicals

16:24.660 --> 16:26.980
 somewhere on their face or on their body surface.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.740
 This has been demonstrated over and over again.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.800
 If you want to learn more about that,

16:30.800 --> 16:32.780
 we did an episode all about chemical signaling

16:32.780 --> 16:33.620
 where you can learn about it.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.380
 I know it sounds weird and you might say,

16:35.380 --> 16:39.580
 I don't do that, but indeed you do most of the time.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.380
 Most everybody does.

16:41.380 --> 16:45.220
 Okay, so this innate immune system is this rapid response.

16:45.220 --> 16:47.580
 When something enters our system

16:47.580 --> 16:49.940
 and our body doesn't recognize it,

16:49.940 --> 16:52.860
 it's not food, it's not clean air,

16:52.860 --> 16:57.140
 it's something that's either a bacteria, virus, or parasite.

16:57.140 --> 17:00.980
 And the innate immune system involves the release

17:00.980 --> 17:03.980
 of particular cells that are waiting dormant,

17:03.980 --> 17:06.620
 ready to attack whatever this invader is.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.480
 And some of these cell types you've heard of before,

17:09.480 --> 17:12.740
 the most typical one are the so-called white blood cells.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.860
 So the white blood cells will actively go to the site

17:15.860 --> 17:18.700
 of invasion and will start to encapsulate

17:18.700 --> 17:23.020
 or try and surround that given invader.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.720
 The other names of these different cell types

17:24.720 --> 17:27.140
 are things like neutrophils, macrophages,

17:27.140 --> 17:28.900
 natural killer cells,

17:28.900 --> 17:31.580
 just a few of the many types of immune cells.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.980
 So there's kind of like an ambulance system,

17:33.980 --> 17:36.180
 but rather than go and try and heal something

17:36.180 --> 17:37.460
 like a paramedic would,

17:37.460 --> 17:39.940
 they go there and they try and surround and kill

17:39.940 --> 17:41.440
 whatever this invader is.

17:42.700 --> 17:47.700
 They work in concert with two other assistants.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.180
 And those assistants are called the complement proteins.

17:51.180 --> 17:54.220
 Complement proteins exist in the blood.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.800
 And what they do is they travel to sites

17:56.800 --> 18:00.820
 where there's an invasion and they mark certain things

18:00.820 --> 18:03.180
 for being engulfed and eaten.

18:03.180 --> 18:06.700
 So they sort of put an eat me tag on it.

18:06.700 --> 18:10.220
 They basically put a chemical tag onto invaders

18:10.220 --> 18:12.820
 that then allows those white blood cells,

18:12.820 --> 18:15.540
 neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells

18:15.540 --> 18:18.620
 to say, ah, I need to basically wrap,

18:18.620 --> 18:20.860
 you'll kill this thing and then wrap it in a body bag

18:20.860 --> 18:22.020
 and send it off, kill that thing,

18:22.020 --> 18:23.520
 wrap it in a body bag and send it off.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.460
 And I'm using the analogy of the body bag,

18:25.460 --> 18:29.380
 but in a sense it is one, it's the right one rather,

18:29.380 --> 18:31.780
 because the cells that come in and kill things,

18:31.780 --> 18:34.340
 the way they do that is actually to engulf

18:34.340 --> 18:36.720
 the invading bacteria virus or parasite.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.020
 So they actually surround it.

18:38.020 --> 18:40.900
 And when you see pus or you see infection

18:42.260 --> 18:45.420
 in maybe a cut on the skin or something like that,

18:45.420 --> 18:49.720
 or even in an ingrown hair that gets some bacteria in it,

18:49.720 --> 18:52.000
 that pus and that the white part,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.220
 I know it's kind of gross to talk about,

18:53.220 --> 18:54.980
 but those are the white blood cells.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.360
 And those are the dead, oftentimes it's dead cells,

18:58.360 --> 19:00.420
 and that's the dead invader sitting there.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.660
 So it's trying to create an isolated compartment

19:02.660 --> 19:04.980
 because it wants to keep it in that part of the body.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.960
 So you've got the innate immune system.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.100
 The compliment comes through blood

19:09.100 --> 19:11.360
 and helps it by tagging certain things

19:11.360 --> 19:12.860
 with an eat me signal.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.740
 And then there are the cells that are either damaged

19:16.740 --> 19:19.100
 from the injury or from the parasite

19:19.100 --> 19:21.820
 or are suffering because of the bacteria

19:21.820 --> 19:23.360
 or the virus itself.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.780
 And the cells of your body will also release

19:27.780 --> 19:30.420
 an alarm signal, which is not an eat me signal,

19:30.420 --> 19:31.720
 but a help me signal.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.040
 And those help me signals come in the form

19:34.040 --> 19:35.740
 what we call cytokines.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.440
 And the cytokines are things like interleukin-1,

19:38.440 --> 19:41.620
 interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha.

19:41.620 --> 19:42.900
 You may have heard of these things

19:42.900 --> 19:45.580
 if you are at all curious about

19:45.580 --> 19:47.460
 or been learning about the health space,

19:47.460 --> 19:49.560
 online health space, especially in the last few years,

19:49.560 --> 19:51.940
 inflammation is all the buzzword now.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.040
 Everyone's talking about inflammation,

19:53.040 --> 19:54.300
 inflammation, inflammation.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.380
 What do we mean when we say inflammation?

19:56.380 --> 19:58.800
 Well, inflammation is a physical response,

19:58.800 --> 20:01.060
 but it's also a chemical response.

20:01.060 --> 20:04.660
 And many times the markers of inflammation

20:04.660 --> 20:08.380
 that are measured in people or an animal model,

20:08.380 --> 20:10.060
 excuse me, where this research is done

20:10.060 --> 20:14.060
 are things like interleukin-1, interleukin-6,

20:14.060 --> 20:15.720
 tumor necrosis factor alpha.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.340
 So when those go up in the blood,

20:17.340 --> 20:19.500
 it's a sign that somewhere there's a cell

20:19.500 --> 20:20.840
 that's saying, help me, help me,

20:20.840 --> 20:22.020
 and it's secreting these things,

20:22.020 --> 20:25.040
 which calls in those neutrophils, macrophages,

20:25.040 --> 20:27.820
 natural killer cells, and white blood cells, okay?

20:27.820 --> 20:29.880
 And it might help to remember all this

20:29.880 --> 20:34.200
 but by just telling people that what interleukin means

20:34.200 --> 20:36.540
 is to communicate, right?

20:36.540 --> 20:38.500
 So the interleukin is shouting out, help me,

20:38.500 --> 20:41.580
 the complement proteins are coming in and saying, eat this,

20:41.580 --> 20:44.300
 and tagging the invader with an eat me signal,

20:44.300 --> 20:46.840
 and then the killer cells and the white blood cells

20:46.840 --> 20:49.320
 are doing the job of trying to kill off that thing.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.140
 That's the innate immune system.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.940
 So your skin and your mucus lining,

20:54.940 --> 20:57.700
 plus your innate immune system

20:57.700 --> 21:02.260
 are a beautiful two-layered set of defenses

21:02.260 --> 21:05.580
 against various kinds of invaders and infections.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.080
 And then there's the third type,

21:07.080 --> 21:09.020
 which is the adaptive immune system.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.300
 And you'll notice that leading up until now,

21:11.300 --> 21:14.060
 I haven't said the word antibody at all,

21:14.060 --> 21:16.180
 and that's because it is the job,

21:16.180 --> 21:20.480
 not of the skin or the mucus or the microbiome

21:20.480 --> 21:23.820
 or the innate immune system to produce antibodies

21:23.820 --> 21:25.840
 that can recognize specific invaders,

21:25.840 --> 21:29.140
 but rather it is the job of the adaptive immune system

21:29.140 --> 21:33.740
 to create antibodies against bacteria, viruses,

21:33.740 --> 21:37.500
 and even parasites and even physical intruders

21:37.500 --> 21:38.860
 to your system.

21:38.860 --> 21:43.320
 So the adaptive immune system has this incredible ability

21:43.320 --> 21:45.980
 to show up at the site of invasion

21:45.980 --> 21:47.520
 or infection or inflammation.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.420
 It's called there by various cues,

21:50.420 --> 21:53.380
 including the cytokines that we talked about earlier.

21:53.380 --> 21:58.380
 And what it does is it actually attaches to

21:58.840 --> 22:02.680
 and creates a sort of an imprint of the shape

22:02.680 --> 22:05.400
 of whatever invader happens to be there.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.580
 So if that particular invading bacteria or virus

22:09.580 --> 22:12.660
 has a contour that's kind of rippled or kind of spiky

22:12.660 --> 22:15.120
 or whatever shape it happens to have,

22:15.120 --> 22:17.340
 it creates an imprint of that.

22:17.340 --> 22:22.340
 And then using that imprint in concert with some other cells

22:22.340 --> 22:25.420
 creates antibodies that are specific

22:25.420 --> 22:26.900
 to recognize that invader

22:26.900 --> 22:31.160
 should the body ever have that invader inside of it again.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.940
 Now that's why it's called the adaptive immune system.

22:33.940 --> 22:38.860
 And in many ways, it creates a memory of a prior infection

22:38.860 --> 22:42.560
 so that these antibodies can be made anytime

22:42.560 --> 22:45.060
 that same invader comes back again, all right?

22:45.060 --> 22:47.860
 And so this is the basis of what we call immunity.

22:47.860 --> 22:51.580
 This is the basis of what we call an enhanced ability

22:51.580 --> 22:54.060
 to combat certain types of infections.

22:54.060 --> 22:55.500
 And it's really a wonderful,

22:55.500 --> 22:59.060
 and I mean, just, I can't even state

22:59.060 --> 23:00.780
 how incredible this really is

23:00.780 --> 23:03.640
 that all of our bodies have this capacity, right?

23:03.640 --> 23:06.980
 We have something called leukocytes.

23:06.980 --> 23:09.740
 These are essentially white blood cells.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.620
 We have red blood cells and white blood cells,

23:11.620 --> 23:15.340
 and they both are derived from the same type of origin cell.

23:15.340 --> 23:16.540
 It's a stem cell.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.780
 When you hear stem cell, a stem cell just means

23:18.780 --> 23:23.260
 a cell that can become many different types of other cells.

23:23.260 --> 23:25.060
 We sometimes hear about stem cells

23:25.060 --> 23:27.840
 in terms of people that are getting injections of stem cells

23:27.840 --> 23:30.740
 or the potential therapeutic effects of,

23:30.740 --> 23:31.940
 or potential of stem cells,

23:31.940 --> 23:35.220
 but we all harbor certain stem cells within us as well

23:35.220 --> 23:37.020
 that can become lots of different cell types.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.100
 And there's one particular type of stem cell,

23:39.100 --> 23:41.060
 which is the hemopoietic stem cell,

23:41.060 --> 23:44.380
 which can give rise to red blood cells and white blood cells.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.960
 And in general, these reside in the marrow,

23:46.960 --> 23:49.180
 at least in adults.

23:49.180 --> 23:50.340
 So in our bone marrow,

23:50.340 --> 23:53.180
 we have this ability to make certain cells

23:53.180 --> 23:57.400
 that can go out when they are called out chemically,

23:57.400 --> 23:59.020
 they're called out to sites of infection

23:59.020 --> 24:00.700
 and create antibodies,

24:00.700 --> 24:03.660
 and then maintain those antibodies in our system

24:03.660 --> 24:06.940
 or have a memory of that particular infection

24:06.940 --> 24:09.060
 so that if the infection comes back again,

24:09.060 --> 24:10.620
 we can kill it off immediately.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.680
 And it doesn't have to pass through these multiple stages

24:13.680 --> 24:16.640
 of first the innate response, then the adaptive response,

24:16.640 --> 24:17.580
 taking some time.

24:17.580 --> 24:18.740
 Now, there are a lot more details

24:18.740 --> 24:20.360
 to the adaptive immune system,

24:20.360 --> 24:23.600
 but I just want to emphasize a few points

24:23.600 --> 24:25.380
 that might be relevant.

24:25.380 --> 24:30.380
 First of all, the name of the antibodies that are created

24:30.500 --> 24:35.500
 sometimes come in the form of IgM and IgG,

24:35.620 --> 24:36.780
 things of that sort.

24:36.780 --> 24:39.500
 This isn't a full deep dive immunology class,

24:39.500 --> 24:43.420
 but Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay?

24:43.420 --> 24:45.180
 So the immunoglobulins are part

24:45.180 --> 24:48.740
 of the adaptive immune response in creating antibodies.

24:49.580 --> 24:54.580
 If you hear IgM, the IgM is the first

24:54.700 --> 24:57.260
 of the adaptive immune responses,

24:57.260 --> 24:58.760
 and it tends to come on earlier.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.980
 So if somebody is immunopositive for IgM

25:01.980 --> 25:05.380
 for a particular type of viral or bacterial invader,

25:05.380 --> 25:08.040
 that means that it was a fairly recent infection.

25:08.940 --> 25:12.180
 Later, one creates the adaptive immune system,

25:12.180 --> 25:14.060
 I should say, creates an IgG,

25:14.060 --> 25:16.980
 which is the more stable form of the specific antibody

25:16.980 --> 25:19.840
 that's going to recognize a given invader.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.900
 So IgG tends to come up a little bit later.

25:21.900 --> 25:26.060
 So just to recap, something gets into your system

25:26.060 --> 25:30.040
 through your eyes, through some hole in your skin,

25:30.040 --> 25:31.720
 a cut through your mouth.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.100
 Sexually transmitted diseases come in

25:35.100 --> 25:39.180
 through the mucous membranes that are on the genitalia

25:39.180 --> 25:40.520
 or in the genitalia.

25:40.520 --> 25:44.760
 Sexually transmitted disease, airborne disease,

25:44.760 --> 25:47.900
 gets into the mucus, somehow gets into the bloodstream.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.320
 Then there's the innate response,

25:50.320 --> 25:52.960
 which is a more general response of trying to contain

25:52.960 --> 25:55.240
 and combat the infection or invader.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.000
 And then the adaptive response is the one

25:57.000 --> 25:58.240
 that generates the antibodies.

25:58.240 --> 26:02.520
 First, the IgM response, the immunoglobulin M response,

26:02.520 --> 26:07.000
 and then the immunoglobulin G response, IgG response.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.640
 So how do we keep these three barriers

26:11.640 --> 26:14.920
 or these three defense systems to infection tuned up?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.640
 Well, leaving aside the list of things

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
 that I mentioned before

26:18.640 --> 26:20.760
 that generally enhances their function,

26:20.760 --> 26:23.440
 things like sleep and sunlight and good nutrition, et cetera,

26:23.440 --> 26:26.680
 the sort of generic things for good health,

26:26.680 --> 26:28.520
 one of the key ways we can do that

26:28.520 --> 26:32.040
 is to keep that mucus lining in really good shape.

26:32.040 --> 26:32.860
 And what does that mean?

26:32.860 --> 26:36.380
 Well, the mucus lining needs to turn over quite often,

26:36.380 --> 26:38.600
 and it needs to be the correct chemistry

26:38.600 --> 26:41.440
 to be a trap for the bad stuff

26:41.440 --> 26:45.560
 and for it to be permeable to the good stuff,

26:45.560 --> 26:47.240
 to the nutrients that we need.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.560
 And it is now very clear from hundreds,

26:49.560 --> 26:50.860
 if not thousands of studies,

26:50.860 --> 26:52.760
 that the best way to do that is to maintain

26:52.760 --> 26:55.340
 a healthy so-called microbiome.

26:55.340 --> 26:58.700
 The microbiome being these little bacterial organisms

26:58.700 --> 27:03.600
 that are good for us that live all along our mucus pathways

27:03.600 --> 27:05.020
 and even in our eyes.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.420
 Now, just to be really clear,

27:07.420 --> 27:09.560
 it's not just about the gut microbiome.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.880
 We actually have a microbiome in our eyes.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.520
 We have one that's specific to our mouth.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.320
 We have a nasal-specific microbiome.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.240
 There's one all along the gut,

27:18.240 --> 27:19.960
 and the species of microbiota

27:19.960 --> 27:22.240
 that live all along the digestive tract

27:22.240 --> 27:24.080
 differ from the mouth to the throat

27:24.080 --> 27:27.160
 to the stomach, intestines, and to the rectum.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.720
 It's well-established that there are healthy microbiota

27:29.720 --> 27:31.240
 that live all along that length

27:31.240 --> 27:33.740
 and they differ along that length.

27:33.740 --> 27:36.760
 There's also a urethral microbiota,

27:36.760 --> 27:38.640
 and there's a vaginal microbiota

27:38.640 --> 27:41.160
 that promotes health of that environment as well.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.540
 So how is it that one can maintain the healthy microbiota

27:45.540 --> 27:48.960
 and not favor growth of harmful bacteria

27:48.960 --> 27:52.840
 or allow that mucus lining to become too permeable

27:52.840 --> 27:55.740
 to the bad stuff that can come in from the environment?

27:55.740 --> 27:57.960
 Well, as far as we know,

27:57.960 --> 28:00.680
 there are three main ways to do that.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.920
 The first two are purely structural and mechanical.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.840
 It's very clear now from work,

28:07.840 --> 28:11.220
 some of which was done at Stanford, but elsewhere as well,

28:11.220 --> 28:15.680
 that the nasal microbiome is particularly good

28:15.680 --> 28:18.840
 at scrubbing bacteria,

28:18.840 --> 28:21.180
 at preventing certain types of infections.

28:21.180 --> 28:24.920
 So this is a reminder that whenever possible,

28:24.920 --> 28:26.520
 unless eating or speaking,

28:26.520 --> 28:28.680
 you want to be nasal breathing,

28:28.680 --> 28:30.120
 not breathing through your mouth.

28:30.120 --> 28:35.120
 Your nose is a much better filter for viruses and bacteria

28:35.200 --> 28:36.500
 than is your mouth.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.960
 The mouth contains certain structural features,

28:38.960 --> 28:40.920
 even organs and cell types

28:40.920 --> 28:43.840
 that can protect against incoming infection,

28:43.840 --> 28:46.740
 but you don't want to be a mouth breather

28:46.740 --> 28:48.060
 for a variety of reasons.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.600
 And there's a terrific book called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic,

28:51.600 --> 28:52.740
 which was written by my colleagues,

28:52.740 --> 28:54.920
 Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford

28:54.920 --> 28:55.980
 and Stanford Medicine

28:55.980 --> 28:58.720
 with a forward by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.440
 So it's really a lot of heavy hitters on that book

29:00.440 --> 29:04.040
 that talks about the increase in infection

29:04.040 --> 29:07.580
 that one gets when breathing through the mouth,

29:07.580 --> 29:08.640
 as opposed to the nose.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.480
 Now, of course, during hard exercise,

29:10.480 --> 29:11.540
 one breathes through the mouth.

29:11.540 --> 29:14.640
 That's not necessarily bad when one is eating or speaking.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.400
 That's not necessarily bad at all.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.960
 I guess it depends on what you're saying.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.860
 It was a joke.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.920
 But in general, when possible,

29:20.920 --> 29:22.640
 you want to be breathing through your nose.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.660
 Many people have trouble breathing through their nose

29:24.660 --> 29:26.480
 because of so-called deviated septums

29:26.480 --> 29:28.780
 or chronically collapsed sinuses.

29:28.780 --> 29:30.800
 The best way to dilate those sinuses

29:30.800 --> 29:32.200
 is actually to breathe through your nose.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.440
 So it can take a little bit of time,

29:33.440 --> 29:36.800
 but there is some plasticity to the sinuses.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.600
 And so be a nose breather, not a mouth breather.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.540
 You will combat more of the infections

29:42.540 --> 29:44.080
 that you are constantly confronted with.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.240
 I should mention that we are always bombarded

29:46.240 --> 29:48.040
 with different types of bacteria, viruses,

29:48.040 --> 29:49.560
 and parasites in our environment.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.360
 And the goal, of course, is to reinforce your immune system

29:53.360 --> 29:56.460
 so you can keep these things at bay and not get sick.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.320
 There's actually a paper that was published in Cell Report,

30:00.320 --> 30:01.780
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,

30:01.780 --> 30:04.180
 that showed that the nasal microbiome,

30:04.180 --> 30:08.040
 it has particular species of microbiota

30:08.040 --> 30:10.360
 that are good at fighting off infection.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.800
 There has not been a direct link

30:12.800 --> 30:15.420
 between particular patterns of nasal breathing

30:15.420 --> 30:17.200
 and the nasal microbiome yet,

30:17.200 --> 30:19.100
 but oxygenation of that environment

30:19.100 --> 30:20.480
 by breathing through your nose

30:20.480 --> 30:22.960
 turns out to be quite important overall

30:22.960 --> 30:24.920
 for enhancing it as a filter.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.520
 So don't just think of your nose

30:26.520 --> 30:28.800
 as something to smell foods and to bring in air.

30:28.800 --> 30:33.680
 It's also an active filter for things that could invade you.

30:33.680 --> 30:37.880
 The other way to try and keep out bad things

30:37.880 --> 30:39.800
 and to avoid getting sick is the advice

30:39.800 --> 30:42.240
 that your mother and certainly my mother gave me,

30:42.240 --> 30:45.440
 which is to not touch your eyes

30:45.440 --> 30:49.440
 after touching other people or touching other surfaces.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.480
 And as I mentioned earlier,

30:51.480 --> 30:53.720
 we tend to do this subconsciously.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.180
 But the reason to avoid doing that

30:55.180 --> 30:58.080
 is the eyes are a primary entry point

30:58.080 --> 31:00.340
 for a lot of bacteria and viruses.

31:00.340 --> 31:02.400
 You're constantly lubricating the surface of your eyes

31:02.400 --> 31:04.920
 with the so-called lacrimal glands and tears

31:04.920 --> 31:06.680
 and things of that sort.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.240
 If you've ever noticed when you wake up in the morning,

31:08.240 --> 31:10.160
 you have some sleep in your eyes,

31:10.160 --> 31:11.240
 either the kind of crusty stuff

31:11.240 --> 31:14.440
 in the corners of your eyes or on your eyelashes,

31:14.440 --> 31:19.140
 that sleep, that crust are actually dead bacteria

31:19.140 --> 31:22.960
 that you've successfully battled during the night.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.800
 That's what that is.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.640
 It's not the accumulation of some healthy tissue.

31:26.640 --> 31:30.080
 It's the accumulation of your healthy mucous membranes

31:30.080 --> 31:31.440
 and tears and other things

31:31.440 --> 31:35.380
 that are specifically combating those bacteria.

31:35.380 --> 31:37.040
 So I know that sounds a little bit gross,

31:37.040 --> 31:37.900
 but that's what that is.

31:37.900 --> 31:41.320
 So you're wiping away the casualties of a battle

31:41.320 --> 31:43.040
 that you fought at night.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.820
 So during the daytime, you don't want to introduce viruses

31:45.820 --> 31:48.080
 and things to your eyes as much as possible.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.660
 It is a primary site of entry.

31:49.660 --> 31:52.880
 This is why people wear goggles in surgical units

31:52.880 --> 31:54.440
 and things of that sort

31:54.440 --> 31:57.840
 to try and avoid getting things into their eyes.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.040
 Very, very important.

31:59.040 --> 32:03.720
 And then the third way to keep a healthy line of defense

32:03.720 --> 32:07.200
 for your entire mucus tract

32:07.200 --> 32:12.160
 is to enhance the proliferation of good gut microbiota.

32:12.160 --> 32:16.000
 The best way to enhance the quality of your gut microbiome

32:16.000 --> 32:20.040
 and the mucus lining that serves as this protective layer

32:20.040 --> 32:24.520
 all along your body is to ingest two to four servings a day

32:24.520 --> 32:27.160
 of fermented foods, low sugar fermented foods.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.840
 I've talked about this before a bunch of times

32:28.840 --> 32:30.140
 on the podcast, but these are data

32:30.140 --> 32:33.600
 from my colleague Justin Sonnenberg's lab at Stanford Med,

32:33.600 --> 32:35.120
 and there I just wiped my eyes.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.040
 Yep, you got me.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.480
 But a paper published in the journal Cell,

32:40.480 --> 32:43.780
 which is a absolutely spectacular journal,

32:43.780 --> 32:47.520
 really points to the fact that when people eat

32:47.520 --> 32:50.160
 fermented foods, two to four servings per day,

32:50.160 --> 32:53.500
 it helps reduce the activity of certain cytokines.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.900
 Now you know what those are, right?

32:54.900 --> 32:57.560
 Cells make cytokines to call out, help me, help me,

32:57.560 --> 33:01.140
 to reduce the amount of cytokines,

33:01.140 --> 33:02.400
 the so-called inflammatome.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.440
 Now that doesn't render those cells more vulnerable.

33:04.440 --> 33:08.120
 The reason they saw a reduction in IL-6 and IL-1

33:08.120 --> 33:09.400
 and some of these other cytokines

33:09.400 --> 33:12.320
 is because when people have a healthy gut microbiome,

33:12.320 --> 33:15.080
 there are fewer cells in the body being infected

33:15.080 --> 33:18.060
 from outside infections and therefore less of a reason

33:18.060 --> 33:19.460
 for cells to be crying out help

33:19.460 --> 33:22.600
 because they are thriving, not suffering.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.240
 So don't wipe your eyes, keep your hands clean.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.240
 Everyone tells you that, right?

33:27.240 --> 33:29.120
 But keep your hands clean, don't wipe your eyes.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.200
 Be a nasal breather, not a mouth breather,

33:31.200 --> 33:33.840
 unless you're speaking, exercising, or eating,

33:33.840 --> 33:36.200
 and keep a healthy gut microbiome

33:36.200 --> 33:38.360
 by eating two to four servings a day

33:38.360 --> 33:40.840
 of quality low sugar fermented foods,

33:40.840 --> 33:43.120
 things like sauerkraut, things like natto,

33:43.120 --> 33:44.920
 if you can access that.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.520
 I've tried it before, it's interesting.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.920
 It's sort of an acquired taste.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.760
 Kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources

33:51.760 --> 33:53.320
 are going to be the sources

33:53.320 --> 33:55.880
 that are going to be most effective for this.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.440
 So now you're armed with three ways

33:58.440 --> 34:00.380
 to enhance the function of your immune system

34:00.380 --> 34:03.860
 and combat infection that is, I like to think,

34:03.860 --> 34:07.160
 separate from the typical type of information that you get,

34:07.160 --> 34:09.320
 such as get good sleep, good nutrition,

34:09.320 --> 34:10.520
 good social connection, et cetera.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.800
 All that stuff still holds true,

34:11.800 --> 34:14.200
 but these three other points,

34:14.200 --> 34:16.280
 I think can really make a substantial difference

34:16.280 --> 34:19.560
 in terms of bolstering the immune system,

34:19.560 --> 34:20.720
 your immune system.

34:20.720 --> 34:21.900
 I do want to mention,

34:21.900 --> 34:24.520
 because these names are going to come up several times

34:24.520 --> 34:25.760
 during this episode,

34:25.760 --> 34:29.880
 that while interleukins like IL-6 and IL-1

34:30.800 --> 34:32.180
 encourage inflammation,

34:32.180 --> 34:33.420
 they are these help me signals

34:33.420 --> 34:36.820
 that call in cells to gobble up invaders.

34:36.820 --> 34:39.440
 There are some interleukins that are anti-inflammatory,

34:39.440 --> 34:41.500
 and the one that I'd like to highlight in particular,

34:41.500 --> 34:43.520
 because it will come up again in a little bit,

34:43.520 --> 34:45.200
 is interleukin-10.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.940
 So not all of the IL, insert number,

34:48.940 --> 34:51.440
 not all of the interleukins are inflammatory,

34:51.440 --> 34:53.880
 some are anti-inflammatory.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.300
 So that's an important point to keep in mind

34:55.300 --> 34:56.400
 as we go forward.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.680
 Next, I'd like to talk about

34:57.680 --> 34:59.720
 what's called sickness behavior.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.580
 And indeed, there is a category of behavior

35:02.580 --> 35:04.640
 that we call sickness behavior

35:04.640 --> 35:06.840
 that is very informative

35:06.840 --> 35:09.120
 as to the things that we can do

35:09.120 --> 35:10.920
 to avoid getting sick.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.620
 Now, this notion of sickness behavior

35:12.620 --> 35:14.960
 goes back several decades or more,

35:14.960 --> 35:18.240
 and it's a very interesting way of looking

35:18.240 --> 35:20.480
 at the function of the immune system,

35:20.480 --> 35:24.400
 because what it does is it bridges us from this thing

35:24.400 --> 35:25.600
 that we're calling the immune system,

35:25.600 --> 35:30.220
 where it's T cells and B cells and cytokines and leukocytes,

35:30.220 --> 35:32.480
 and it starts taking us into the realm of the nervous system

35:32.480 --> 35:35.640
 because, of course, the nervous system controls behavior.

35:35.640 --> 35:40.040
 So sickness behavior is a suite of responses

35:40.040 --> 35:44.180
 that we tend to all undergo when we are feeling sick.

35:44.180 --> 35:47.640
 So this is going to vary from person to person,

35:47.640 --> 35:49.360
 but there's some general categories of things

35:49.360 --> 35:52.180
 that we all do and that happen to all of us

35:52.180 --> 35:54.180
 after we are wounded or sick

35:54.180 --> 35:56.020
 or dealing with an infection of any kind.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.500
 And by examining sickness behavior in some detail,

35:59.500 --> 36:01.340
 it can be really informative

36:01.340 --> 36:03.980
 as to routes that we can take to health.

36:03.980 --> 36:06.980
 So the main thing about sickness behavior

36:06.980 --> 36:09.540
 is that it tends to involve a slowing

36:09.540 --> 36:11.540
 of our usual levels of activity.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.600
 People start to feel lethargic

36:13.600 --> 36:15.720
 or they feel like the activities

36:15.720 --> 36:18.600
 that previously they could do with relative ease

36:18.600 --> 36:22.400
 are very difficult for them or somewhat overwhelming.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.600
 The other thing you start to see

36:23.600 --> 36:27.360
 is that people and animals, by the way, stop grooming.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.880
 They stop taking care of themselves,

36:28.880 --> 36:30.300
 not necessarily stop showering,

36:30.300 --> 36:31.640
 although oftentimes that's the case,

36:31.640 --> 36:34.280
 but they will stop doing their hair.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.520
 They'll stop putting on makeup.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.880
 You know, depending on whether or not they did that before,

36:38.880 --> 36:39.720
 they might stop.

36:39.720 --> 36:43.040
 Animals will stop licking and grooming themselves.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.760
 People will stop taking care of their cosmetic appearance.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.300
 Now, it's not just because they don't care

36:49.300 --> 36:50.420
 how they look when they're sick.

36:50.420 --> 36:53.280
 It's because there's this overall suppression

36:53.280 --> 36:54.880
 of certain kinds of activities

36:54.880 --> 36:57.040
 and an enhancement of other kinds of activities.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.240
 And this is really important.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.980
 Sickness behavior is actually a motivated state.

37:02.980 --> 37:06.720
 It's a state that's designed to accomplish certain things.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.560
 One of the other features of sickness behavior,

37:09.560 --> 37:12.120
 in addition to being lethargic, loss of grooming,

37:12.120 --> 37:15.800
 will be a loss of appetite, right?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.880
 Oftentimes people who have a great appetite

37:17.880 --> 37:20.240
 normally just won't feel hungry at all.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.580
 And there are several theories as to why this would be.

37:22.580 --> 37:25.680
 One prominent idea in the literature

37:25.680 --> 37:29.920
 is that it's to discourage vomiting and diarrhea,

37:29.920 --> 37:33.320
 which of course can be infectious to other people.

37:33.320 --> 37:35.080
 So that's a theory.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.500
 I don't know that that's ever been tested directly,

37:37.500 --> 37:39.200
 but that's one idea.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.160
 The other idea is that it's simply

37:41.160 --> 37:44.800
 to harbor more resources for sake of repair.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.200
 And I want to talk about that

37:46.200 --> 37:50.120
 because we are all told to get extra sleep

37:50.120 --> 37:52.440
 when we aren't feeling well or to rest.

37:52.440 --> 37:55.680
 But just like any good two or three-year-old

37:55.680 --> 37:58.260
 constantly asks, why, why?

37:58.260 --> 38:02.400
 Good scientists, good people who are interested

38:02.400 --> 38:04.900
 in health information should always be asking,

38:04.900 --> 38:06.240
 why, why should I get more sleep?

38:06.240 --> 38:07.880
 What happens in sleep

38:07.880 --> 38:09.520
 that I should get more sleep when I'm sick?

38:09.520 --> 38:11.160
 Why shouldn't I just push through this?

38:11.160 --> 38:13.280
 And there are a couple reasons for this

38:13.280 --> 38:15.160
 that have been established in the literature.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.520
 The first is that there does seem to be something useful

38:18.520 --> 38:21.840
 about slowing circulation when we are ill.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.340
 One idea that has some data to support it

38:24.340 --> 38:27.000
 is that when we slow our circulation,

38:27.000 --> 38:28.560
 our blood circulation,

38:28.560 --> 38:30.900
 so not running around so much or running at all,

38:30.900 --> 38:34.460
 but rather lying down, getting extra rest,

38:34.460 --> 38:37.240
 maybe sleeping, maybe even just remaining still

38:37.240 --> 38:39.380
 is that the lymphatic system,

38:39.380 --> 38:42.560
 which carries a lot of the immune-related cells and fluids

38:42.560 --> 38:45.560
 is able to ramp up its levels of activity.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.880
 So this is interesting, right?

38:46.880 --> 38:49.240
 So reducing circulation of the blood,

38:49.240 --> 38:52.840
 but increasing circulation of the lymphatic system.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.920
 You've all probably been familiar with the lymphatic system.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.320
 When you're combating an infection,

38:57.320 --> 38:59.320
 your lymph nodes can get sore.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.720
 You've got lymph nodes behind your ears

39:00.720 --> 39:02.920
 and your groin, your armpits, around your throat,

39:02.920 --> 39:06.560
 around near your thyroid, in your throat, et cetera.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.900
 So that's the other reason.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.880
 Now, some people, when they get sick,

39:13.240 --> 39:16.800
 psychologically go into a very vulnerable state

39:16.800 --> 39:19.180
 where they really, really want people,

39:19.180 --> 39:20.860
 other people to take care of them.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.840
 You've probably witnessed this

39:22.840 --> 39:25.300
 or you feel this way yourself.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.660
 About 50% of people have that response.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.360
 They really want to be taken care of.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.000
 Now, when you think about it from an adaptive perspective,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.480
 this makes sense, right?

39:33.480 --> 39:36.100
 A member of our species is ill

39:36.100 --> 39:39.460
 and they more or less will cry out for help

39:39.460 --> 39:42.460
 in one form or another to the other members of their species

39:42.460 --> 39:44.200
 to take care of them.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.720
 And of course, this will be especially apparent

39:46.720 --> 39:48.900
 in cases where people are young enough

39:48.900 --> 39:50.120
 or incapacitated enough

39:50.120 --> 39:52.720
 that they can't actually get resources on their own.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.720
 If you've ever been really sick,

39:53.720 --> 39:55.160
 just getting up and going to the fridge

39:55.160 --> 39:59.920
 or to the restroom can feel like a monumental task.

39:59.920 --> 40:04.080
 So about 50% of people report or describe

40:04.080 --> 40:06.660
 seeking of help and support when they are sick.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.560
 But you could also imagine

40:08.560 --> 40:11.800
 how this would be a very non-adaptive response

40:11.800 --> 40:14.040
 because it increases the opportunity

40:14.040 --> 40:16.380
 to spread infection to the caretaker.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.200
 So that's an interesting consideration.

40:20.100 --> 40:24.720
 Another 50% of people seem to have the opposite response

40:24.720 --> 40:25.560
 when they're sick.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.140
 So somehow, regardless of how they were

40:28.140 --> 40:29.800
 prior to getting ill,

40:29.800 --> 40:32.200
 the sickness behavior that's engaged

40:32.200 --> 40:34.040
 by these neural circuits in the brain,

40:34.040 --> 40:35.760
 they are indeed neural circuits in the brain,

40:35.760 --> 40:37.640
 create a stay away from me.

40:37.640 --> 40:38.640
 I don't want to be bothered.

40:38.640 --> 40:39.660
 I want to be left alone.

40:39.660 --> 40:41.240
 I don't want to be taken care of, right?

40:41.240 --> 40:42.720
 It's not stubbornness.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.840
 It's literally a lack of interest or a disinterest

40:46.840 --> 40:48.640
 in social connection when one is sick.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.160
 And you see this in animals too.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.920
 Some animals will seek out other members of their species.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.840
 Others, like my unfortunately now passed away,

40:55.840 --> 40:57.360
 Bulldog Costello, when he was sick,

40:57.360 --> 40:59.160
 I always knew because he would go around

40:59.160 --> 41:00.720
 the back of the house and he would just hide there.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.600
 He would just take himself away from everybody else.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.400
 He did not want to be taken care of.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.480
 And it was just a natural response to him.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.840
 I don't think he was trying to prevent me

41:08.840 --> 41:11.140
 from getting whatever it was that he had.

41:11.140 --> 41:14.400
 So if ever somebody doesn't want to be taken care of,

41:14.400 --> 41:15.640
 or if they do want to be taken care of,

41:15.640 --> 41:19.400
 realize that people tend to fall into these two bins naturally

41:19.400 --> 41:21.880
 and animals tend to fall into these bins,

41:21.880 --> 41:24.880
 regardless of what species they are, it's about 50-50.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.480
 And again, this sickness behavior is a motivated state.

41:28.480 --> 41:31.580
 It's designed to slow circulation of the blood,

41:31.580 --> 41:33.520
 increase circulation of the lymph

41:33.520 --> 41:36.320
 and the other killer cells in the body,

41:36.320 --> 41:38.900
 reduce the probability of infecting others

41:38.900 --> 41:42.020
 by reducing its thought, diarrhea and vomit,

41:42.020 --> 41:45.240
 but also breathing on others, interacting with others.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.300
 And in some cases it will activate this,

41:48.300 --> 41:50.040
 I don't want to call it a regressed state,

41:50.040 --> 41:54.060
 but many people feel somewhat more if they are adults,

41:54.060 --> 41:56.380
 they feel more childlike when they are ill

41:56.380 --> 41:58.340
 and they want to be taken care of very badly.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.300
 Some of it might be learned,

41:59.300 --> 42:02.620
 some of it might be innate, we don't know,

42:02.620 --> 42:05.040
 but the sickness behavior is very interesting

42:05.040 --> 42:06.080
 for a couple of reasons.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.120
 First of all, it mimics another state

42:09.120 --> 42:11.760
 that has been described in the neuroscience literature,

42:11.760 --> 42:13.540
 which is major depression.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.760
 And in both sick individuals,

42:17.760 --> 42:20.160
 sick from bacterial viral infection,

42:20.160 --> 42:21.720
 and in people with major depression,

42:21.720 --> 42:24.760
 it's been shown that there are robust increases

42:24.760 --> 42:27.720
 in the levels of interleukin-6

42:27.720 --> 42:29.800
 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.

42:29.800 --> 42:33.580
 So there is an idea now circulating that depression

42:33.580 --> 42:37.600
 involves these inflammatory cytokines being very active.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.920
 And we know that illness involves inflammatory cytokines

42:40.920 --> 42:42.180
 being very active.

42:42.180 --> 42:43.020
 So if you think about it,

42:43.020 --> 42:45.920
 the similarity between major depression and being sick

42:46.920 --> 42:49.960
 ought to be able to point us in a direction of interventions

42:49.960 --> 42:52.680
 that could help us either prevent illness

42:52.680 --> 42:55.100
 or move through illness more quickly.

42:55.100 --> 42:58.160
 But as we head in that direction,

42:58.160 --> 43:00.040
 because indeed that's the case,

43:00.040 --> 43:02.720
 I just want to emphasize that sickness behavior

43:02.720 --> 43:04.280
 is what provides this bridge

43:04.280 --> 43:07.720
 between the immune system and the nervous system.

43:07.720 --> 43:11.400
 And what we'll soon see also is that healthy behavior,

43:11.400 --> 43:13.660
 behavior that allows us to avoid infection

43:13.660 --> 43:16.320
 also points to a clear bridge

43:16.320 --> 43:18.800
 between the nervous system and the immune system.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.600
 That it isn't just that we have a brain

43:20.600 --> 43:21.880
 and body and our organs,

43:21.880 --> 43:23.040
 and then we have an immune system.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.920
 That's true, but they're interacting all the time.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.960
 And this is going to lead us to a place

43:27.960 --> 43:29.920
 where it's going to be very clear

43:29.920 --> 43:33.500
 and not at all surprising how certain patterns of thinking

43:33.500 --> 43:36.760
 and certain behaviors that we can elect to take

43:36.760 --> 43:40.680
 can help enhance our immune system function and vice versa.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.200
 There are two other features of sickness behavior

43:43.200 --> 43:45.260
 definitely worth pointing out.

43:45.260 --> 43:48.680
 One is a theory, which is that the reduced appetite,

43:48.680 --> 43:53.320
 in particular appetite for protein-rich foods when sick

43:53.320 --> 43:56.680
 is thought to be an attempt,

43:56.680 --> 43:59.600
 a subconscious attempt of the organism

43:59.600 --> 44:02.880
 to reduce the amount of iron that it's taking in.

44:02.880 --> 44:05.460
 Now, typically the amount of iron intake

44:06.560 --> 44:09.440
 that's recommended or more or less is for men,

44:09.440 --> 44:11.760
 it's about eight milligrams per day.

44:11.760 --> 44:14.740
 For women, it's anywhere from 18 to 27 milligrams per day,

44:14.740 --> 44:16.240
 depending on whether or not they're pregnant,

44:16.240 --> 44:18.860
 lactating or menstruating, et cetera.

44:18.860 --> 44:20.080
 The ranges can vary.

44:21.240 --> 44:24.640
 But, and indeed it's true that if iron levels in the blood

44:24.640 --> 44:28.880
 go too high, like over 45 milligrams per day,

44:28.880 --> 44:30.920
 it can be very toxic to the system.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.720
 But the theory that's prominent in the biology literature

44:34.720 --> 44:37.020
 and in the health literature is that the reduction

44:37.020 --> 44:41.160
 in appetite is actually an attempt to reduce iron intake

44:41.160 --> 44:44.240
 specifically because many bacteria

44:44.240 --> 44:46.860
 and other forms of infection seem to thrive

44:46.860 --> 44:49.840
 when levels of iron in the blood are high.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.840
 Now, I don't want to see anyone take this to extreme

44:51.840 --> 44:53.680
 and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet

44:53.680 --> 44:55.960
 in order to get well.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.160
 But it's an interesting theory that I'd be remiss

44:58.160 --> 45:01.540
 if I didn't mention, because it makes good sense.

45:01.540 --> 45:04.800
 Iron is actually attached to hemoglobin

45:04.800 --> 45:06.760
 and red blood cells in the bloodstream.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.220
 Normally that can help us quite a lot.

45:10.220 --> 45:11.360
 It's also in muscle.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.360
 I should mention that iron can be sequestered into muscle

45:14.360 --> 45:19.080
 and iron serves a lot of important health promoting roles,

45:19.080 --> 45:24.080
 but by reducing appetite and thereby reducing iron intake,

45:24.600 --> 45:27.120
 it does reduce the capacity of certain things,

45:27.120 --> 45:29.300
 including infections to travel

45:29.300 --> 45:31.580
 in certain compartments within the body.

45:31.580 --> 45:33.320
 So again, that's just theory,

45:33.320 --> 45:35.600
 but I think many of you are probably familiar

45:35.600 --> 45:38.480
 with not having an appetite when you're sick.

45:39.940 --> 45:42.920
 The other thing that's very typical

45:42.920 --> 45:46.160
 of people with major depression is loss of appetite.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.840
 Not always, but often loss of appetite.

45:47.840 --> 45:49.720
 So here again, we have loss of appetite

45:49.720 --> 45:52.560
 in sickness behavior, loss of appetite in major depression.

45:52.560 --> 45:55.220
 And perhaps not surprisingly,

45:55.220 --> 45:58.140
 one of the major symptoms of sickness behavior

45:58.140 --> 46:01.880
 and major depression that map more or less onto one another

46:01.880 --> 46:04.260
 is loss of libido or interest,

46:04.260 --> 46:05.720
 not just in social interactions,

46:05.720 --> 46:07.280
 but in sex and reproduction.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.480
 And so again,

46:08.480 --> 46:10.740
 if you think about sickness behavior and depression,

46:10.740 --> 46:12.920
 they are very, very similar.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.720
 Okay, so sickness behavior and major depression

46:15.720 --> 46:19.280
 have certain core features in common.

46:20.400 --> 46:24.520
 We need to therefore ask ourselves why and how

46:24.520 --> 46:27.160
 does being sick influence the way that we think

46:27.160 --> 46:32.160
 and perceive our environment and impact our appetite,

46:32.540 --> 46:34.440
 whether or not we want to be cared for more

46:34.440 --> 46:35.400
 or cared for less.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.800
 Again, people tend to diverge

46:36.800 --> 46:39.040
 into two different bins there.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.340
 And believe it or not,

46:40.340 --> 46:43.760
 the pathway for this has been identified.

46:43.760 --> 46:47.280
 When we have an infection someplace in our body,

46:47.280 --> 46:48.840
 and it could be up in our head,

46:48.840 --> 46:50.340
 it could be a sinus infection,

46:50.340 --> 46:51.920
 it could be an ear infection,

46:51.920 --> 46:55.740
 or I should also mention many of these same mechanisms

46:55.740 --> 46:57.780
 can also be the consequence of a wound

46:57.780 --> 46:59.400
 or an injury to the body,

46:59.400 --> 47:02.680
 you know, a back injury or a slipped disc,

47:02.680 --> 47:04.720
 or I guess it's called a herniated disc

47:04.720 --> 47:07.700
 is the way that you hear it described.

47:07.700 --> 47:10.080
 When we have that, we can be kind of irritable.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.760
 We don't want to do certain things

47:11.760 --> 47:13.880
 and we just want to be left alone.

47:13.880 --> 47:14.760
 Things are harder.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.160
 How, why?

47:16.160 --> 47:18.920
 Well, there's a known pathway,

47:18.920 --> 47:21.800
 which is the so-called vagus nerve

47:21.800 --> 47:24.360
 that connects the body and the brain,

47:24.360 --> 47:26.940
 signals to particular brain sites

47:26.940 --> 47:30.980
 to engage this category of motivational state

47:30.980 --> 47:32.540
 that we call sickness behavior.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.800
 Many of you have probably heard of the vagus,

47:35.800 --> 47:37.480
 V-A-G-U-S, vagus.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.960
 The vagus nerve is a very extensive nerve pathway.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.080
 It's the 10th cranial nerve

47:42.080 --> 47:45.920
 comes out of the back of the brainstem,

47:45.920 --> 47:49.400
 heads into the body and branches out extensively

47:49.400 --> 47:53.160
 to innervate or connect to many of our organs,

47:53.160 --> 47:55.400
 including our lungs, our heart, our gut, et cetera.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.780
 And all of those organs are able also

47:57.780 --> 48:00.440
 to send neural signals back up to the brain.

48:01.480 --> 48:02.860
 We sometimes hear the vagus

48:02.860 --> 48:06.600
 as the route to calming ourselves down.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.920
 Unfortunately, that's more or less a myth

48:08.920 --> 48:10.960
 that I don't know how it got propagated.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.060
 You have lots of different pathways in the vagus.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.560
 Usually vagal stimulation

48:14.560 --> 48:17.160
 actually creates more arousal and alertness,

48:17.160 --> 48:19.160
 although it does have multiple pathways.

48:19.160 --> 48:23.520
 But there have now been many studies of the vagus

48:23.520 --> 48:25.880
 in various contexts, including in sickness behavior.

48:25.880 --> 48:29.040
 And it's very clear that the vagus nerve

48:29.040 --> 48:33.640
 is the fast pathway by which an infection in the body

48:33.640 --> 48:34.840
 is signaled to the brain

48:34.840 --> 48:36.200
 to a particular location in the brain

48:36.200 --> 48:37.400
 called the hypothalamus,

48:37.400 --> 48:40.180
 which harbors a lot of different types of neurons.

48:40.180 --> 48:42.280
 Neurons, for instance, in the preoptic area

48:42.280 --> 48:45.240
 that increase body temperature and fever, right?

48:45.240 --> 48:46.560
 That's one of the most important things

48:46.560 --> 48:48.320
 is to increase body temperature

48:48.320 --> 48:50.440
 in order to, it's the body's attempt

48:50.440 --> 48:52.880
 to kill off this invader

48:52.880 --> 48:57.000
 because many viruses and many bacteria

48:57.000 --> 48:59.200
 don't survive well at elevated heat.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.520
 That's the function of a fever.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.160
 A fever actually has a functional role.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.960
 So in biology, we like complicated words.

49:04.960 --> 49:07.800
 So we call anything that increases body temperature

49:07.800 --> 49:11.040
 or creates a fever a pyrogen.

49:11.040 --> 49:14.100
 Many years ago in my undergraduate years,

49:14.100 --> 49:16.320
 I was working on pyrogens,

49:16.320 --> 49:19.200
 injecting something called lippy polysaccharide

49:19.200 --> 49:22.880
 into the belly, which then gives you a fever.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.320
 The way it does that is LPS causes

49:25.320 --> 49:28.000
 an inflammation response in the gut.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.620
 The gut doesn't know what is happening.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.520
 The stomach cells don't know what's happening.

49:31.520 --> 49:35.860
 So they just start secreting the IL-6, the IL-1,

49:35.860 --> 49:38.740
 all those cytokines, the killer cells migrate into the gut.

49:38.740 --> 49:40.280
 That's why you sometimes get a stomach ache

49:40.280 --> 49:41.160
 when you don't feel well,

49:41.160 --> 49:43.000
 you have a flu or something like it.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.300
 So a neural signal, electrical signals get sent up

49:46.300 --> 49:47.340
 to the hypothalamus.

49:47.340 --> 49:48.180
 The hypothalamus says,

49:48.180 --> 49:49.840
 oh, I don't know what's going on out there,

49:49.840 --> 49:51.500
 but there's a signal something's going on.

49:51.500 --> 49:53.140
 Let's just heat up the body.

49:53.140 --> 49:56.060
 Let's just start cooking whatever it is out there.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.800
 And of course, you don't want fever to go too high

49:57.800 --> 49:59.540
 because you can kill brain cells,

49:59.540 --> 50:02.480
 but within a particular range,

50:02.480 --> 50:06.780
 the fever is a functional and adaptive response, okay?

50:06.780 --> 50:09.720
 So if you're taking drugs to try and lower the fever,

50:09.720 --> 50:11.140
 that might make you feel more comfortable,

50:11.140 --> 50:14.020
 but actually that's limiting the response

50:14.020 --> 50:15.060
 that your body is creating

50:15.060 --> 50:17.900
 in order to try and kill off that invader.

50:17.900 --> 50:20.900
 And again, you don't want fever to go too high.

50:20.900 --> 50:23.420
 This is going to vary depending on age.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.340
 You can look up online

50:24.340 --> 50:27.220
 what the tolerable ranges are for fever,

50:27.220 --> 50:29.780
 but when you're trying to lower body temperature,

50:29.780 --> 50:31.380
 when you have a fever,

50:31.380 --> 50:34.820
 unless you're heading into dangerous levels of heating up,

50:34.820 --> 50:36.860
 that's actually the wrong way to take your system

50:36.860 --> 50:40.180
 if you do indeed want to kill off that invader.

50:40.180 --> 50:42.280
 Okay, so the vagus nerve is the quick response.

50:42.280 --> 50:46.700
 It also sends input to areas of the brain

50:46.700 --> 50:49.200
 that change your perception of the outside world.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.860
 One of the most obvious of these,

50:51.860 --> 50:56.060
 obvious once I tell it to you, is photophobia, right?

50:56.060 --> 50:57.460
 I love bright sunshine.

50:57.460 --> 51:00.140
 I love bright lights when I want to be alert.

51:00.140 --> 51:02.940
 We all have different levels of light sensitivity,

51:02.940 --> 51:05.780
 but most people, when they are sick,

51:05.780 --> 51:08.420
 when there's an inflammation response in the body,

51:08.420 --> 51:10.640
 they feel like bright lights are kind of aversive.

51:10.640 --> 51:14.060
 They get a well-described kind of classical photophobia.

51:14.060 --> 51:17.820
 And that's mediated by a pathway that goes from your eye

51:17.820 --> 51:20.880
 to an area of your thalamus

51:20.880 --> 51:24.040
 called the anterior nucleus of the thalamus.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.980
 This is work that was done by Clifford Saper

51:25.980 --> 51:27.860
 at Harvard Medical School.

51:27.860 --> 51:30.000
 It's really beautiful work.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.580
 And then from there up to the outer lining of the brain,

51:34.580 --> 51:36.020
 which is the meninges,

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
 just sort of on the outside of the brain

51:38.020 --> 51:39.420
 where the brain starts to interface

51:39.420 --> 51:41.380
 with some of the other connective tissues.

51:41.380 --> 51:43.040
 We'll talk more about these later.

51:43.040 --> 51:46.540
 It can actually create a photophobia and a headache

51:46.540 --> 51:47.500
 when one is ill.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.580
 So here's the pathway.

51:49.580 --> 51:51.900
 Some invader gets into your system

51:51.900 --> 51:53.940
 because you wiped your eyes or it got in through your mouth.

51:53.940 --> 51:55.100
 You didn't listen to your mother

51:55.100 --> 51:57.100
 and got in through your eyes.

51:57.100 --> 51:58.200
 You're feeling sick.

51:59.100 --> 51:59.980
 Something's going on there.

51:59.980 --> 52:00.860
 You have a stomach ache

52:00.860 --> 52:03.180
 because of all the inflammation there.

52:03.180 --> 52:05.540
 The signal goes up from your vagus nerve.

52:05.540 --> 52:07.320
 You're heating up with a fever.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.260
 You've got photophobia

52:09.260 --> 52:12.140
 because you've activated this pathway

52:12.140 --> 52:15.220
 by which what would normally be tolerable light

52:15.220 --> 52:19.100
 is triggering this thalamic nucleus, the anterior thalamus.

52:19.100 --> 52:20.780
 That's projecting up to the meninges.

52:20.780 --> 52:23.120
 You've got a headache in response to looking at light.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.320
 It's basically triggering an overall pathway

52:25.320 --> 52:28.400
 to get you to go into a quiet, dark place and rest.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.420
 And the last element I'd like to talk about is the rest.

52:31.420 --> 52:33.440
 There's something that gets triggered

52:33.440 --> 52:35.940
 from the body to the brain to the hypothalamus.

52:35.940 --> 52:38.460
 And we think we know which hypothalamic area it is.

52:38.460 --> 52:40.740
 It's the supraoptic nucleus, we think.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.260
 Supraoptic because it's right above

52:42.260 --> 52:43.900
 your so-called optic chiasm.

52:43.900 --> 52:45.100
 If you want to look up where that is,

52:45.100 --> 52:46.740
 it's right above the roof of your mouth.

52:46.740 --> 52:51.740
 And there are nuclei there that promote the desire to sleep

52:52.060 --> 52:54.280
 even during the daytime,

52:54.280 --> 52:55.740
 what would normally be the active phase

52:55.740 --> 52:57.800
 of your circadian cycle.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.060
 Now, that is really interesting

53:00.060 --> 53:01.500
 because what's happening here

53:01.500 --> 53:04.660
 is you've got multiple pathways that are saying,

53:04.660 --> 53:08.860
 avoid light, reduce your amount of behavior,

53:08.860 --> 53:11.200
 heat up all the things that are making you sick.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.220
 This is sickness behavior,

53:12.220 --> 53:15.580
 and it's going from your body to your mind

53:15.580 --> 53:18.060
 to make you do the right thing.

53:18.060 --> 53:20.560
 Now, there's also a slow pathway

53:20.560 --> 53:23.100
 that's purely mediated by the blood,

53:23.100 --> 53:25.660
 so-called humoral factors, not because they're funny,

53:25.660 --> 53:28.720
 but humoral factors are factors of the blood.

53:28.720 --> 53:33.720
 As you have an infection for many hours or days,

53:33.720 --> 53:38.720
 the amount of IL-6 and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor

53:39.560 --> 53:41.780
 and other inflammatory cytokines

53:41.780 --> 53:45.280
 is starting to increase such that the total amount

53:45.280 --> 53:47.380
 in your circulation gets high enough

53:47.380 --> 53:49.740
 and is communicated to the brain.

53:49.740 --> 53:52.400
 And it tends to enter the brain

53:52.400 --> 53:54.260
 through a particular type of tissue

53:54.260 --> 53:56.240
 that's really interesting called choroid,

53:56.240 --> 53:58.880
 C-H-O-R-O-I-D.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.640
 Choroid is really interesting.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.120
 It's kind of this fluffy tissue

54:03.120 --> 54:04.260
 that sits in your ventricles.

54:04.260 --> 54:06.160
 The ventricles are the spaces in your brain,

54:06.160 --> 54:07.520
 and the spaces in your brain

54:07.520 --> 54:09.900
 have what's called cerebral spinal fluid in them.

54:09.900 --> 54:11.120
 The cerebral spinal fluid contains

54:11.120 --> 54:12.380
 a number of important things,

54:12.380 --> 54:16.080
 but the choroid starts releasing and responding

54:16.080 --> 54:19.640
 to these cytokines, the inflammatory cytokines,

54:19.640 --> 54:23.320
 and then the brain actually starts to experience

54:23.320 --> 54:27.340
 all sorts of changes in terms of inflammation to neurons.

54:27.340 --> 54:29.040
 Your memory tends to get poor.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.280
 Your cognition tends to get poor.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.980
 These are transient things most often.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.580
 Eventually these things will pass,

54:35.580 --> 54:36.960
 but this is deep into sickness

54:36.960 --> 54:38.320
 when you're really feeling lousy.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.880
 You can't read, you can't watch a movie,

54:39.880 --> 54:40.720
 you can't do anything.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.160
 So if you ever get sick

54:42.160 --> 54:44.620
 and you just can't be bothered by anything,

54:44.620 --> 54:47.380
 it's probably because you've had that fast response

54:47.380 --> 54:50.320
 from the body, and you've also had this slower response

54:50.320 --> 54:52.920
 where you literally have a set of tissues in your brain

54:52.920 --> 54:56.260
 that are sending out these inflammatory signals,

54:56.260 --> 54:58.880
 and now your whole brain is starting to cope

54:58.880 --> 55:00.880
 or is trying to cope with this infection.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.280
 So you've got a slow pathway and a fast pathway.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.480
 That all sounds really terrible.

55:06.480 --> 55:09.160
 So now I'd like to talk about what you can do

55:09.160 --> 55:12.500
 to reduce the probability of getting sick,

55:12.500 --> 55:16.600
 and there are actually things that one can do

55:16.600 --> 55:19.120
 as you start to get sick and once you're sick

55:19.120 --> 55:23.320
 to accelerate the healing process by flipping the equation.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.640
 Up until now, we've been talking about

55:24.640 --> 55:28.080
 how the body activates certain areas in the brain

55:28.080 --> 55:29.380
 to create sickness behavior

55:29.380 --> 55:30.920
 that's very much like depression.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.080
 You're probably all familiar with this

55:32.080 --> 55:33.640
 from any time you've had a cold or a flu

55:33.640 --> 55:35.900
 or something really lousy or an injury.

55:35.900 --> 55:39.080
 Now let's flip the equation and ask,

55:39.080 --> 55:41.880
 what can we do with our nervous system

55:41.880 --> 55:45.120
 in order to enhance the function of our immune system

55:45.120 --> 55:47.280
 in order to be able to heal and recover

55:47.280 --> 55:49.560
 from illness and injury more quickly?

55:49.560 --> 55:52.600
 So let's say you are in that unfortunate circumstance

55:52.600 --> 55:57.000
 of waking up one day or coming home,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.980
 and you've got that tickle in your throat,

55:59.980 --> 56:02.600
 or when you breathe, your nasal passages

56:02.600 --> 56:03.760
 don't feel the same way,

56:03.760 --> 56:04.820
 you've got a little bit of a headache,

56:04.820 --> 56:06.160
 you're feeling kind of off.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.320
 We all know what we should do.

56:08.320 --> 56:12.060
 We should all hydrate, drink some water, and go to sleep.

56:12.060 --> 56:14.360
 Right, that's what we are all told.

56:14.360 --> 56:18.200
 But there are actually things that you can actively do

56:18.200 --> 56:20.400
 in order to get your immune system

56:20.400 --> 56:23.860
 to deploy a more robust response

56:23.860 --> 56:27.700
 at that early phase of potential infection.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.740
 Let's focus first on the rest component.

56:32.620 --> 56:34.520
 Yes, of course, we are all told

56:34.520 --> 56:36.720
 that we should take a hot shower and go to sleep,

56:36.720 --> 56:38.680
 and get nine or 10 hours of sleep.

56:38.680 --> 56:42.280
 But there's an interesting way of looking at sleep

56:42.280 --> 56:47.080
 specifically for its role in enhancing the immune system.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.760
 And there's a wonderful review.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.220
 I'll put the review in the captions

56:52.220 --> 56:55.020
 that looked specifically at the literature

56:55.020 --> 56:59.240
 surrounding sleep that is different

56:59.240 --> 57:02.720
 because it occurs in support of the immune system.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.160
 So normally when we go to sleep,

57:04.160 --> 57:05.640
 we have slow wave sleep predominantly

57:05.640 --> 57:06.920
 in the early phase of the night.

57:06.920 --> 57:09.160
 And then over time, as we sleep longer and longer,

57:09.160 --> 57:11.520
 we get more so-called REM, rapid eye movement sleep.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.200
 Talked all about this on the episodes on sleep.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.200
 Of course, you have slow wave sleep and REM sleep

57:16.200 --> 57:17.440
 throughout the night always,

57:17.440 --> 57:19.080
 but it's the fraction of slow wave sleep

57:19.080 --> 57:20.480
 to REM sleep that shifts.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.860
 And they have different functions, et cetera.

57:23.760 --> 57:26.260
 There is some evidence that the sleep

57:26.260 --> 57:29.120
 associated with an infection,

57:29.120 --> 57:31.680
 in particular early stage of infection,

57:31.680 --> 57:36.240
 is associated with elevated levels of serotonin in the brain

57:36.240 --> 57:39.120
 that either through an adaptive mechanism

57:39.120 --> 57:40.720
 or for whatever reason,

57:40.720 --> 57:42.460
 the brain, the neurons in the brain

57:42.460 --> 57:43.920
 of the so-called raffae nucleus

57:43.920 --> 57:46.380
 start releasing more serotonin.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.280
 And that that serotonin and its related pathways

57:50.280 --> 57:53.840
 can help enhance some of the immune system function

57:53.840 --> 57:56.160
 that could combat the infection.

57:56.160 --> 57:59.520
 There is starting to be some data,

57:59.520 --> 58:00.920
 and I emphasize starting

58:00.920 --> 58:03.480
 because it's not a very robust literature yet,

58:03.480 --> 58:06.520
 looking at whether or not supplementing precursors

58:06.520 --> 58:09.240
 to serotonin like 5-HTP,

58:09.240 --> 58:12.480
 which can be taken in a supplement form,

58:12.480 --> 58:17.480
 or consuming foods that increase serotonin naturally.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.300
 So these would be any foods

58:19.300 --> 58:20.760
 that contain high levels of tryptophan.

58:20.760 --> 58:21.960
 You can look up what those are.

58:21.960 --> 58:25.160
 So white meat turkey, for instance,

58:25.160 --> 58:27.480
 certain complex carbohydrates

58:27.480 --> 58:30.440
 can often be rich with tryptophan.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.040
 That consuming those foods

58:32.040 --> 58:34.020
 can enhance the amount of serotonin

58:34.020 --> 58:36.000
 that's available in the brain and blood,

58:36.000 --> 58:39.200
 and thereby lead to the particular quality of sleep

58:39.200 --> 58:41.440
 that allows for more deep healing,

58:41.440 --> 58:43.240
 or for, when I say deep healing,

58:43.240 --> 58:46.180
 I mean for a more robust immune response.

58:46.180 --> 58:49.880
 Now, again, those are still emerging data.

58:49.880 --> 58:52.040
 What is very clear, however,

58:52.040 --> 58:53.640
 is that during sleep,

58:53.640 --> 58:55.200
 and in particular during sleep

58:55.200 --> 58:56.920
 that's associated with the early stage

58:56.920 --> 58:59.620
 of any kind of viral or bacterial infection,

58:59.620 --> 59:02.480
 the so-called glymphatic system

59:02.480 --> 59:05.020
 is much more active than it would be normally.

59:05.020 --> 59:06.400
 What's the glymphatic system?

59:06.400 --> 59:07.400
 The glymphatic system

59:07.400 --> 59:10.480
 is actually a relatively recent discovery.

59:10.480 --> 59:14.000
 I mentioned lymph and the lymphatic system earlier.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.520
 The glymphatic system with a G

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
 is a system in the brain

59:18.520 --> 59:22.240
 by which debris that accumulates throughout the day,

59:22.240 --> 59:23.800
 but in particular,

59:23.800 --> 59:27.200
 debris that accumulates under conditions of neuroinflammation

59:27.200 --> 59:29.840
 and inflammation of the body

59:29.840 --> 59:33.080
 is cleared out or is washed out of the brain.

59:33.080 --> 59:36.280
 And the activity of this glymphatic system

59:36.280 --> 59:38.200
 is extremely important

59:38.200 --> 59:41.800
 for the recovery from infection of any kind.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.880
 And it's now becoming clear

59:43.880 --> 59:46.840
 is important for recovery from traumatic head injury

59:46.840 --> 59:49.720
 and maybe even from psychological trauma.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.760
 So the glymphatic system

59:51.760 --> 59:53.680
 can be thought of more or less as a plumbing system

59:53.680 --> 59:55.160
 that runs through the ventricles,

59:55.160 --> 59:57.620
 but also mainly through the lining

59:57.620 --> 59:59.680
 that sits between the brain and the skull

59:59.680 --> 1:00:03.020
 and some of the other tissues and things of that sort.

1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:05.160
 The choroid is involved as well.

1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:07.200
 Brain imaging reveals the glymphatic system

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:08.640
 is very active during deep sleep,

1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:11.400
 and there's this kind of washout of the glymphatic system.

1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:14.440
 And I'm aware of some studies that are ongoing now

1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:17.240
 where augmenting the serotonin system

1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:21.680
 through either supplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:24.600
 or even serotonin itself, these are laboratory studies,

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.080
 is being looked at for its capacity

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.520
 to increase the amount of circulation

1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:30.000
 in the glymphatic system.

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.580
 And the idea is that it might, and I want to underscore,

1:00:32.580 --> 1:00:35.600
 might potentially lead to more rapid recovery

1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:39.280
 from injury and illness and potentially ramp up,

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:41.840
 if you will, the activity of the immune system.

1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:43.620
 So it essentially is a ramping up

1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:45.320
 of the activity of the immune system.

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.660
 Now, regardless of whether or not you decide to,

1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:52.060
 for instance, supplement with 5-HTP before sleep or not,

1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:54.260
 I'll talk about what that might look like in a moment,

1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:56.440
 there is a way that you can increase the activity

1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:00.160
 of your glymphatic system under normal circumstances.

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:02.680
 Because of the mechanics of the glymphatic system,

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:06.720
 it turns out that if you elevate your heels

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:08.360
 by about 12 degrees,

1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:10.000
 it doesn't have to be exactly 12,

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000
 as you sleep by putting maybe a rolled pillow

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.800
 or two pillows underneath your feet,

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.480
 by having the head below your legs,

1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:20.100
 it seems that there's more glymphatic washout

1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:21.960
 or clearance during sleep.

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:23.600
 And this is without taking any compound

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:25.160
 to adjust the serotonin system.

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:27.420
 So I would say, if you're not feeling well,

1:01:27.420 --> 1:01:28.600
 yes, take the hot shower.

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:30.640
 Yes, get into bed and go to sleep,

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:33.440
 but elevate your feet to try and increase the activity

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:34.680
 of the glymphatic system.

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:39.680
 Some might even consider that if you have to be awake,

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:42.900
 that you might want to be awake with your feet

1:01:42.900 --> 1:01:45.000
 elevated above your head.

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.960
 Now that might not be practical for the workplace,

1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:50.640
 but it might be practical for a short nap during the day

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:51.780
 or something of that sort.

1:01:51.780 --> 1:01:54.280
 The glymphatic system is not just active during sleep,

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:56.400
 it's also active during certain phases of waking,

1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:00.000
 in particular, when we are in a deep state of relaxation.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.380
 So as many of you probably know,

1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:04.800
 I'm a big proponent of self-hypnosis

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:07.260
 because of the quality scientific literature on this.

1:02:07.260 --> 1:02:08.840
 If you're interested in self-hypnosis,

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:11.960
 you can go to Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.960
 Reveri is a cost-free app for Apple and Android

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:18.080
 that was developed by my colleague, David Spiegel,

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:20.380
 and others at the Stanford University School of Medicine

1:02:20.380 --> 1:02:23.240
 based on quality studies and peer-reviewed data

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:26.800
 showing that deep states of relaxation can be used

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:28.960
 to improve pain management,

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.720
 improve transition time to sleep,

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.400
 and a number of other things.

1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:36.040
 You can select the various sort of outcomes

1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:37.920
 that you're seeking using Reveri.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.320
 It's a great thing that,

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:40.840
 especially for people that are challenged

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.320
 with meditation could use

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:43.560
 because you just listen to the script,

1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.080
 involves deep relaxation.

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:47.640
 I would suggest using that script,

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:48.800
 or the script for sleep,

1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:50.800
 but with feet elevated to increase activity

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:52.040
 of the glymphatic system.

1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:56.000
 Now, if you do decide that you want to test out

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.180
 this serotonin hypothesis on your own,

1:02:58.180 --> 1:02:59.520
 obviously check with a doctor.

1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:00.920
 I'm not a doctor, I'm a professor,

1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:02.720
 so I'm professing things, not suggesting things.

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:06.600
 But 5-HTP is a supplement that I've talked about before

1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:10.360
 on this podcast that I actually do not recommend

1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:12.400
 for most people for sake of sleep

1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:16.240
 because it can disrupt the normal architecture of sleep

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:18.540
 and create a deep sleep early in the night

1:03:18.540 --> 1:03:19.960
 and then a spontaneous waking

1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:21.760
 with some trouble to get back to sleep.

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:23.840
 And that's because of the way that the serotonin system

1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:25.920
 and the melatonin system interact.

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:28.880
 However, under conditions where one is feeling

1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:30.200
 like they might have an infection

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.540
 or an early stage of illness,

1:03:32.540 --> 1:03:35.800
 in that case, 5-HTP might be a useful supplement

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.200
 in order to access these states of sleep

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:39.720
 that are not typical.

1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:42.800
 They're not the typical deep sleep that you would achieve

1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:43.880
 when you're feeling healthy.

1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:47.140
 These are states of sleep that are specifically there

1:03:47.140 --> 1:03:50.420
 in order to try and repair some of the immune system

1:03:50.420 --> 1:03:52.560
 related inflammation that's occurring.

1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:55.720
 If you'd like to explore the 5-HTP approach

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.780
 and you feel it's right and safe for you

1:03:57.780 --> 1:03:59.560
 and you've talked to your doctor,

1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:03.420
 it's 300 to 500 milligrams taken about 30 to 60 minutes

1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:06.360
 before going to sleep for the night.

1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:08.580
 That's the typical protocol.

1:04:08.580 --> 1:04:10.440
 Not incidentally,

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:15.740
 increasing serotonin is also one typical approach

1:04:15.740 --> 1:04:17.080
 for the treatment of major depression.

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:19.880
 This is the basis for things like SSRI,

1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:21.840
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:26.440
 like Prozac and Zoloft and so forth.

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:29.860
 The 5-HT approach is a much milder approach

1:04:29.860 --> 1:04:31.520
 than prescription drug, of course,

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:36.240
 but will allow more serotonin to be synthesized

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.400
 and or released.

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:39.900
 Now, for those of you that are interested

1:04:39.900 --> 1:04:41.680
 in learning more about the glymphatic system,

1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:43.120
 it's a fascinating system,

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:44.840
 and you might want to do a deep dive there

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:46.360
 in terms of the behavioral protocols

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:47.200
 and what's known about it.

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:49.920
 There's a wonderful article called

1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:52.560
 The Glymphatic System, A Beginner's Guide.

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:55.000
 This is a scientific article.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:59.480
 The first author is Jessen is the last name, J-E-S-S-E-N.

1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:01.960
 If you put in Jessen, the glymphatic system,

1:05:01.960 --> 1:05:02.800
 A Beginner's Guide,

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.320
 you can access the full length manuscript easily online.

1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.240
 It'll show up immediately in your search.

1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:11.120
 And in a really interesting way,

1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:14.480
 the glymphatic system has now also been tied

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:17.220
 to the iron deposition system.

1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:18.640
 Earlier, we were talking about iron

1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:21.080
 and how, of course, getting enough dietary iron

1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:23.960
 is important, but if levels of iron are too high,

1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:27.120
 it isn't good for a number of reasons.

1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:28.920
 There's a very interesting article

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:30.680
 that just came out last year called

1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:34.120
 Dysfunction of the Glymphatic System Might Be

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.000
 Related to Iron Deposition in the Normal Aging Brain.

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.920
 So we're starting to see these links

1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:42.640
 between iron levels being too high,

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:46.360
 the glymphatic system not being active enough,

1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:49.760
 and so forth, leading to sickness behavior,

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:52.460
 inflammation, and maybe even damage to neurons

1:05:52.460 --> 1:05:54.080
 associated with aging.

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.440
 We can flip that on its head and say that

1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:58.920
 increasing the activity of the glymphatic system,

1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:01.440
 feet elevated during deep sleep,

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:05.140
 maybe even feet elevated above the head,

1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:09.400
 while awake during a nap or doing a reverie script

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:11.400
 once a day or something of that sort,

1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:13.740
 could increase the activity of the glymphatic system,

1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:18.740
 lowering iron to a point that's probably below

1:06:18.740 --> 1:06:22.720
 the typical intake during periods of infection,

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:24.860
 perhaps, perhaps I should say,

1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:27.460
 can enhance the glymphatic system and vice versa.

1:06:27.460 --> 1:06:30.460
 And then you've got this specialized sleep

1:06:30.460 --> 1:06:32.700
 that's related to sickness behavior

1:06:32.700 --> 1:06:35.480
 that seems to have heightened levels of serotonin

1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:39.840
 that might be augmented by increasing, excuse me,

1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:42.900
 that might be augmented by ingesting 5-HTP.

1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:44.900
 Again, not on a regular basis.

1:06:44.900 --> 1:06:47.060
 I don't suggest that people take compounds

1:06:47.060 --> 1:06:49.120
 that increase serotonin unless it's prescribed to you

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:50.700
 for depression or something,

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:55.180
 but not doing it by supplement with tryptophan or 5-HTP

1:06:55.180 --> 1:06:57.700
 on a regular basis, but only under conditions where,

1:06:57.700 --> 1:07:00.080
 as I mentioned, you might be starting to feel sick

1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:01.140
 or you're coming down with something

1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:03.500
 or you're combating some sort of infection.

1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:06.680
 So if we consider the advice that we typically get

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:08.580
 when we're not feeling well of take a hot shower,

1:07:08.580 --> 1:07:10.380
 get into bed and go to sleep,

1:07:10.380 --> 1:07:14.420
 and we've now touched on ways to potentially increase

1:07:14.420 --> 1:07:17.120
 the efficacy of the sleep part through the glymphatic

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.500
 and the serotonin system.

1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:20.100
 What about the take a hot shower part?

1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:20.940
 Is that good advice?

1:07:20.940 --> 1:07:21.780
 Well, it turns out it is,

1:07:21.780 --> 1:07:24.080
 and there's actually a way to do even better.

1:07:25.060 --> 1:07:27.780
 There's a study, very interesting study.

1:07:27.780 --> 1:07:29.660
 The title reveals where I'm going with this.

1:07:29.660 --> 1:07:33.500
 It's effect of a single finish sauna session

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:36.260
 on white blood cell profile and cortisol levels.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.460
 In this case, it was done in athletes and non-athletes,

1:07:38.460 --> 1:07:40.340
 which is kind of nice.

1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:44.220
 This involves taking athletes and non-athletes

1:07:44.220 --> 1:07:46.000
 and exposing them to sauna.

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.740
 It wasn't particularly hot.

1:07:47.740 --> 1:07:49.900
 It was 96 degrees, which isn't cool,

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:50.940
 but it's not really hot.

1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:53.860
 Nowadays, you hear about people doing very, very hot sauna.

1:07:53.860 --> 1:07:55.480
 The humidity of the sauna, if you want to know,

1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:57.220
 is 15 plus or minus 3%.

1:07:57.220 --> 1:07:58.940
 But basically what they found

1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:01.280
 was that just one 15-minute sauna session

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:03.540
 could really increase white blood cell profiles

1:08:03.540 --> 1:08:05.960
 and could adjust cortisol levels in ways

1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:08.740
 that were beneficial for combating infection.

1:08:08.740 --> 1:08:11.060
 And now there are many other studies like this.

1:08:11.060 --> 1:08:12.940
 Now, this should immediately make sense

1:08:12.940 --> 1:08:14.540
 based on what we said before about fever.

1:08:14.540 --> 1:08:17.780
 Heating up can actually help combat infection.

1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:18.940
 But for those of you that have listened

1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:20.820
 to the episodes on temperature,

1:08:20.820 --> 1:08:22.900
 what you probably know is that when you get into a sauna

1:08:22.900 --> 1:08:24.300
 or any kind of hot environment,

1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:26.540
 your body is also going to be actively pushing

1:08:26.540 --> 1:08:28.160
 to cool itself off.

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:30.720
 So there's probably an increase in heat.

1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.300
 There is an increase in heating,

1:08:32.300 --> 1:08:34.320
 that then afterwards your body will cool off,

1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:36.420
 maybe even with a dip below baseline.

1:08:36.420 --> 1:08:38.520
 I do want to provide a cautionary note

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:40.880
 that if you are already running a fever,

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:43.240
 getting into a sauna could take your body temperature

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:44.740
 into dangerously high levels,

1:08:44.740 --> 1:08:46.460
 dangerously meaning you can kill neurons.

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:48.940
 And once you kill neurons, they do not come back.

1:08:48.940 --> 1:08:50.700
 So please don't kill your neurons.

1:08:51.740 --> 1:08:53.900
 I don't recommend getting into a sauna

1:08:53.900 --> 1:08:55.180
 if you're already running a fever.

1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:56.900
 So this would be something to do

1:08:56.900 --> 1:08:58.620
 at the initial stage of an infection

1:08:58.620 --> 1:09:00.340
 or if you're feeling a little bit off.

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:04.020
 So this is kind of a ramping up or a super protocol

1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:05.740
 of the typical advice of take a hot shower

1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:06.580
 and get into bed.

1:09:06.580 --> 1:09:07.400
 That is good advice.

1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:09.860
 Now we're talking about a hot sauna,

1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:12.400
 probably showering off and then getting into bed,

1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:14.340
 maybe augmenting serotonin.

1:09:14.340 --> 1:09:16.540
 I know many people don't have access to sauna.

1:09:16.540 --> 1:09:19.580
 So in that case, a very hot bath or shower,

1:09:19.580 --> 1:09:21.100
 don't scald yourself of course,

1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:23.620
 but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate

1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:26.180
 or right at that edge of what you can tolerate

1:09:26.180 --> 1:09:27.360
 would be a good idea.

1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:29.980
 Some people I've heard are creating saunas in their bathrooms

1:09:29.980 --> 1:09:32.440
 by running hot water and creating a ton of steam.

1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:35.520
 Anything that really heats you up,

1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:36.860
 but not to dangerously high levels

1:09:36.860 --> 1:09:38.160
 is going to be beneficial.

1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:41.240
 If you have access to a sauna, terrific.

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:44.840
 This again was only 15 minutes.

1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:47.800
 They'd had a cool off session.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:50.160
 Would you get more of an increase?

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:51.920
 People always want to know if you did it twice as much,

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:53.380
 would you get twice increase?

1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:54.760
 Those data don't really exist yet.

1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:56.360
 However, if you are interested

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:58.600
 in maximizing the effects of sauna,

1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:01.540
 it is clear that a cool off period is important.

1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:04.320
 So it's not that a 15 minute sauna is good

1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:05.880
 and a 30 minute sauna is better.

1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:09.080
 If you are going to take that route of exploring more,

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.380
 it does seem that doing a 15 minute heating period

1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:14.600
 followed by a five to 10 minute cooling period

1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:18.600
 and then getting back into the heat can be beneficial.

1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:19.580
 And this is interesting.

1:10:19.580 --> 1:10:23.420
 It gets to the mechanisms by which the hypothalamus

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:25.980
 that areas, the areas of the hypothalamus that is,

1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:28.220
 that generate increases in body heat.

1:10:28.220 --> 1:10:32.600
 The activation of those neurons occurs as you heat up.

1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:35.500
 And then were you to just stay in that heated environment,

1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:36.680
 they would actually shut off

1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:38.720
 and some other neurons would be handling the job,

1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:39.640
 so to speak.

1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:42.200
 But by getting in and out of the heated environment,

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.420
 you actually force that system to send repeated pulses

1:10:45.420 --> 1:10:47.800
 of these cortisol lowering

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:51.320
 and white cell stimulating signals to the body.

1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:53.000
 Some of you have probably heard the phrase,

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.200
 feed a fever, starve a cold.

1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:57.920
 I don't know who first said that.

1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.380
 I couldn't find the citation, but we hear this

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:05.420
 and we can speculate that the reason that phrase,

1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:08.140
 feed a fever, starve a cold came to be

1:11:08.140 --> 1:11:10.740
 is because of the adaptive function of fever

1:11:10.740 --> 1:11:13.000
 that increases in body temperature,

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.340
 make it challenging for intruding viruses

1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:19.140
 and bacteria to survive.

1:11:19.140 --> 1:11:20.380
 Even though of course,

1:11:20.380 --> 1:11:23.100
 highly elevated body temperatures pose a danger

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:24.600
 to the host organism, to you.

1:11:27.220 --> 1:11:30.980
 Feeding, eating does cause an increase in body temperature

1:11:30.980 --> 1:11:33.440
 through the so-called thermogenic effect of food.

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:36.700
 So I can understand the logic of feed a fever.

1:11:36.700 --> 1:11:38.660
 It would mean that when you have a fever,

1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:40.540
 it's your body's natural attempt

1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:44.100
 to heat up and kill some invading thing.

1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:45.040
 And by eating,

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:47.900
 you would further increase your body temperature.

1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:51.180
 Why you would want to starve a cold, I don't know, however.

1:11:52.300 --> 1:11:55.260
 Maybe it's because when your nasal passages are congested,

1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:58.020
 it's uncomfortable to eat or something of that sort.

1:11:58.020 --> 1:11:59.900
 So the feed a fever part makes sense to me

1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:02.860
 that the starve a cold part is still mysterious to me.

1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:06.820
 I couldn't find any logical reason why that would be good.

1:12:06.820 --> 1:12:08.340
 There are communities out there

1:12:08.340 --> 1:12:11.820
 that believe that fasting is a viable way

1:12:11.820 --> 1:12:14.700
 to combat certain types of infection.

1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:18.340
 Fasting in particular prolonged fast

1:12:18.340 --> 1:12:21.500
 do increase the amount of adrenaline,

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:24.260
 also called epinephrine in the brain and body.

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:27.900
 And as we will next explain epinephrine,

1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.020
 adrenaline does have a powerful effect

1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:33.220
 on the various inflammatory cytokines

1:12:33.220 --> 1:12:35.340
 and on the immune system in general.

1:12:35.340 --> 1:12:38.140
 So let's talk about a behavioral protocol

1:12:38.140 --> 1:12:39.160
 that anyone can use.

1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:40.660
 It doesn't involve any equipment.

1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:42.220
 You don't need a sauna.

1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:43.660
 You don't need anything at all

1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:45.620
 that has been demonstrated

1:12:45.620 --> 1:12:47.540
 in excellent peer reviewed research

1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:49.940
 to enhance the function of the immune system

1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:52.900
 and actually allow people to combat infection

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:54.740
 in very dramatic ways.

1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:58.860
 Next, I'd like to do an in-depth analysis of a study

1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:01.740
 that has achieved some prominence out there,

1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:05.060
 not just in the scientific literature, but on the internet,

1:13:05.060 --> 1:13:09.480
 because it relates to how particular types of breathing

1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:11.580
 can impact the immune system

1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:14.620
 and the ability to combat infection.

1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:17.820
 The title of this paper is voluntary activation

1:13:17.820 --> 1:13:19.580
 of the sympathetic nervous system

1:13:19.580 --> 1:13:23.980
 and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans.

1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:27.220
 This is a paper that was published in PNAS,

1:13:27.220 --> 1:13:28.980
 which is the Proceedings of the National Academy

1:13:28.980 --> 1:13:30.080
 of Sciences USA.

1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:32.180
 It's a very prestigious journal.

1:13:33.140 --> 1:13:34.500
 For those of you that know PNAS,

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.580
 you know that there are certain papers published in PNAS

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:39.340
 or there used to be that were not peer reviewed.

1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:40.180
 In recent years,

1:13:40.180 --> 1:13:42.300
 I think all of them have moved to peer reviewed papers.

1:13:42.300 --> 1:13:46.340
 So this is a peer reviewed, very high quality study.

1:13:46.340 --> 1:13:50.140
 And I just want to describe the basic contour of the study.

1:13:50.140 --> 1:13:51.340
 I'll explain the findings,

1:13:51.340 --> 1:13:52.660
 and then I want to go in depth

1:13:52.660 --> 1:13:55.780
 and explain the mechanistic basis for these findings

1:13:55.780 --> 1:14:00.040
 and the protocol that we can all export from these findings.

1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:01.800
 So here we go.

1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:04.480
 First of all, a couple of terms

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.380
 so that everybody is on the same page.

1:14:07.380 --> 1:14:09.040
 The sympathetic nervous system

1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:11.460
 is one division of our nervous system.

1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:14.680
 It's a set of neurons down the middle of our spinal cord

1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:19.500
 and in our brain that generally lead to a heightened state

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:20.980
 of arousal and alertness.

1:14:20.980 --> 1:14:23.500
 It's associated with epinephrine release in the brain

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.640
 and adrenaline release in the body.

1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:27.820
 It's the so-called fight or flight system

1:14:27.820 --> 1:14:29.380
 when it's really active,

1:14:29.380 --> 1:14:33.220
 but it's the system that's active when we are wide awake.

1:14:34.420 --> 1:14:37.820
 And we already talked about the innate immune system.

1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:39.620
 That's that first line of defense

1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:42.080
 after the skin barrier, of course,

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:44.620
 whereby some infection comes into the body

1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:48.660
 and there's this rapid response of increasing inflammation.

1:14:48.660 --> 1:14:52.060
 And that's also about the time that you first feel lousy.

1:14:52.060 --> 1:14:52.900
 So when you start to feel like,

1:14:52.900 --> 1:14:54.140
 oh, I think I've got something.

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.020
 I don't feel right.

1:14:55.020 --> 1:14:55.860
 I have a headache.

1:14:55.860 --> 1:14:56.980
 I feel nauseous.

1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:57.820
 I'm heating up.

1:14:57.820 --> 1:14:58.660
 I don't feel good.

1:14:58.660 --> 1:15:02.060
 That's the innate immune system kicking in.

1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:05.220
 That's what they did in this study.

1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:07.700
 And by the way, I should say they,

1:15:07.700 --> 1:15:10.840
 this is the first author is Cox, K-O-X,

1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.540
 last author, last name Pickers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S.

1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:20.160
 What they did was they exposed human subjects

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:21.540
 to an endotoxin.

1:15:21.540 --> 1:15:26.300
 In other words, they injected people with E. coli,

1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:27.860
 there's a bacteria,

1:15:27.860 --> 1:15:31.300
 which makes people, all people feel terrible.

1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:36.300
 See nauseous, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, very unpleasant.

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:39.060
 These people voluntarily signed up for this study.

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:42.620
 However, some of the subjects in this study

1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:47.140
 performed a behavioral protocol

1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:50.700
 that can best be described as cyclic hyperventilation.

1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:53.180
 My lab works on these types of breathing protocols.

1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:54.620
 This is not work that my lab did,

1:15:54.620 --> 1:15:57.820
 but basically subjects hyperventilate,

1:15:57.820 --> 1:16:00.100
 followed by breath retention, by breath holds.

1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:02.180
 And I'll explain exactly what they did.

1:16:02.180 --> 1:16:05.560
 They also looked at other forms of behavioral protocols,

1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:06.960
 but let's focus on that one.

1:16:08.340 --> 1:16:09.820
 So they're comparing controls

1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:12.080
 that do just sort of a basic meditation

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:14.400
 versus people that do this intense breathing

1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:15.900
 followed by some breath holds.

1:16:16.740 --> 1:16:18.440
 I'm just paraphrasing here.

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:20.460
 In the intervention group, the breathing group,

1:16:20.460 --> 1:16:24.540
 plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,

1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:27.740
 so this is a cytokine that lowers inflammation,

1:16:27.740 --> 1:16:32.120
 increased after endotoxin administration,

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:35.780
 and that was triggered by an increase

1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:37.060
 in epinephrine and adrenaline.

1:16:37.060 --> 1:16:39.500
 So in other words, doing a particular pattern of breathing

1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:42.340
 allowed an anti-inflammatory cytokine to be turned on,

1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:45.420
 whereas that was not the case in the subjects

1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:49.860
 that did not do this particular breathing protocol.

1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:53.700
 And they discovered that levels of pro-inflammatory

1:16:53.700 --> 1:16:56.360
 TNF alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha,

1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:59.420
 IL-6, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8,

1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:01.240
 which you should all be familiar with now,

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.620
 as pro-inflammatory cytokines

1:17:03.620 --> 1:17:05.560
 were lower in the intervention group,

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:07.760
 whereas these IL-10 levels

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.500
 that are anti-inflammatory went up.

1:17:10.700 --> 1:17:13.160
 Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower

1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:14.500
 in the intervention group.

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:16.740
 So this is an amazing finding, right?

1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:18.340
 These are human subjects.

1:17:18.340 --> 1:17:21.300
 One group of subjects is doing this breathing protocol.

1:17:21.300 --> 1:17:23.420
 The other group of subjects is just meditating.

1:17:23.420 --> 1:17:25.320
 They both, both sets of subjects

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:28.520
 have been injected with E. coli,

1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:31.500
 so you know everyone's getting the same amount

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.460
 placed into their system.

1:17:33.460 --> 1:17:35.720
 This is very, very interesting,

1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:38.940
 and it leads to the question that every good scientist,

1:17:38.940 --> 1:17:41.280
 two-year-old, or health information seeker asks,

1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:42.940
 which is, why?

1:17:42.940 --> 1:17:43.780
 How?

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:44.780
 How in the world does this work?

1:17:44.780 --> 1:17:45.940
 Why does this work?

1:17:45.940 --> 1:17:49.720
 Well, to make a long story short-ish,

1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:51.980
 because I am going to go into depth here,

1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:53.960
 the reason it works is because

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:55.880
 the sympathetic nervous system,

1:17:55.880 --> 1:18:00.780
 the so-called stress part of our nervous system,

1:18:00.780 --> 1:18:01.640
 it's not really called that,

1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:04.140
 but the part of our nervous system that triggers stress

1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:07.420
 from mild stress to severe stress, even to panic,

1:18:08.660 --> 1:18:11.340
 causes the release of adrenaline and epinephrine

1:18:11.340 --> 1:18:13.020
 in the brain and body.

1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:15.260
 And under normal circumstances,

1:18:15.260 --> 1:18:18.500
 when we have some sort of invading infection,

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:21.980
 our body is able to push back on that to resist it

1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:23.920
 by engaging the stress response.

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:27.940
 So what's happening here is there's a behavioral protocol

1:18:27.940 --> 1:18:29.420
 involving the nervous system,

1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:30.640
 because all behaviors are generated

1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:32.380
 from the nervous system, of course,

1:18:32.380 --> 1:18:36.180
 a behavioral protocol that people are deliberately employing

1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:39.820
 that allows them to activate the sympathetic nervous system,

1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:43.580
 which in turn allows them to activate the normal pathways

1:18:43.580 --> 1:18:48.320
 by which immune system function is enhanced, okay?

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:51.260
 Now, the reason I'm underscoring this is that

1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:53.860
 the common interpretation of this study is that

1:18:53.860 --> 1:18:57.860
 somehow it blocks the normal immune response,

1:18:57.860 --> 1:18:59.740
 but that's not really what's happening here.

1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:03.500
 Yes, there's a reduction in inflammatory cytokines

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:06.380
 and there's an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines,

1:19:06.380 --> 1:19:08.300
 but that's not really the same thing

1:19:08.300 --> 1:19:10.580
 as blocking the immune response.

1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:12.460
 This could just as easily be viewed

1:19:12.460 --> 1:19:14.060
 as enhancing the immune response

1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:18.100
 and combating the intruder, in this case, E. coli.

1:19:18.100 --> 1:19:21.920
 So let's parse this study a little bit more closely.

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:24.880
 First of all, what is this magical pattern of breathing?

1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:26.300
 Some of you may recognize this

1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:28.100
 as so-called Wim Hof breathing.

1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:29.780
 Wim, of course, the Dutchman.

1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:31.100
 I think his occupation online

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:33.500
 used to be listed as Daredevil, believe it or not.

1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:37.340
 On Wikipedia, that's a pretty cool occupation.

1:19:37.340 --> 1:19:42.340
 Wim is best known for his activities with cold exposure.

1:19:42.620 --> 1:19:44.980
 He holds multiple world records for that,

1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:48.460
 swimming under icebergs and other incredible feats

1:19:48.460 --> 1:19:50.780
 that you definitely don't want to try

1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:52.380
 unless you're extremely skilled

1:19:52.380 --> 1:19:54.700
 and really know what you're doing as he does,

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:56.860
 but also for the use of breath work.

1:19:56.860 --> 1:20:00.380
 The breathing that is so-called Wim Hof breathing

1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:02.340
 is very similar, not exactly the same,

1:20:02.340 --> 1:20:05.380
 but very similar to Tummo breathing

1:20:05.380 --> 1:20:07.380
 as it's been described historically.

1:20:07.380 --> 1:20:09.720
 In the science and physiology community

1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:12.540
 and in my laboratory, because I run a university laboratory,

1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:14.620
 we refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation,

1:20:14.620 --> 1:20:17.940
 which just means repeated deep breaths in and out,

1:20:17.940 --> 1:20:19.340
 and then there are these retention.

1:20:19.340 --> 1:20:23.100
 So because I'm here in the hot seat anyway,

1:20:23.100 --> 1:20:24.860
 I might as well demonstrate it for you

1:20:24.860 --> 1:20:26.120
 so you know what this looks like.

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:27.380
 There are variations on this.

1:20:27.380 --> 1:20:31.080
 So with respect to Wim, with respect to Tummo practitioners,

1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:34.100
 with respect to the cyclic hyperventilators everywhere,

1:20:34.100 --> 1:20:35.980
 this is one general theme of it.

1:20:35.980 --> 1:20:40.380
 It involves 20 to 30 deep inhales

1:20:40.380 --> 1:20:42.820
 and then exhales through the mouth,

1:20:42.820 --> 1:20:47.740
 followed by a exhale of all one's air and a breath hold.

1:20:47.740 --> 1:20:49.780
 That's the retention.

1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:53.300
 And then at some point, 15 to 60 seconds later,

1:20:53.300 --> 1:20:55.460
 repeating the 25 or 30 breaths,

1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:59.020
 and then again, a breath hold with lungs empty.

1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:01.820
 There are variations on this, but in our laboratory

1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:04.460
 and in this particular study,

1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:05.940
 it looks something like this, okay?

1:21:05.940 --> 1:21:07.380
 I'm not going to do the whole thing right now,

1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:09.100
 but it goes something like this.

1:21:09.100 --> 1:21:14.100
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.900
 Okay, so let's assume I did that for 30 breaths.

1:21:20.900 --> 1:21:23.820
 I can already feel myself perspiring a little bit.

1:21:23.820 --> 1:21:26.260
 You're heating up, that's the release of adrenaline.

1:21:26.260 --> 1:21:27.580
 It's caused by that breathing pattern

1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:28.980
 and then exhaling all of one's air,

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:30.860
 no speaking in between like I'm doing.

1:21:30.860 --> 1:21:31.700
 Ah.

1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:37.780
 And then sitting, lungs empty

1:21:37.780 --> 1:21:39.820
 until one feels the impulse to breathe

1:21:39.820 --> 1:21:42.100
 and then repeating for several rounds,

1:21:42.100 --> 1:21:43.720
 two or three or even four rounds.

1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:45.880
 Now, some people will also introduce

1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:48.440
 a big inhale and breath hold at the end

1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:50.740
 and find that indeed they can hold their breath

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:53.000
 much longer than they normally would be able to

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.580
 because the trigger to breathe is normally activated

1:21:56.580 --> 1:21:59.660
 by increases in carbon dioxide in our blood.

1:21:59.660 --> 1:22:01.540
 We have neurons in our brainstem

1:22:01.540 --> 1:22:04.220
 and in our various regions of our brain actually

1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:07.220
 that respond to when carbon dioxide is too high

1:22:07.220 --> 1:22:08.700
 and trigger the reflex to breathe.

1:22:08.700 --> 1:22:10.940
 But when we exhale deeply,

1:22:10.940 --> 1:22:12.820
 we blow off a lot of carbon dioxide

1:22:12.820 --> 1:22:15.820
 so we don't feel that impulse to breathe come quite as soon.

1:22:17.860 --> 1:22:21.020
 Basically, this study looked at people doing

1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:24.420
 these cyclic hyperventilation with retention,

1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:26.700
 25 or 30 breaths, then the retention,

1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:29.500
 25 or 30 breaths, then retention, 25 or 30 breaths,

1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:30.340
 then the retention.

1:22:30.340 --> 1:22:33.460
 So three rounds of 25 to 30 breaths followed by exhale,

1:22:33.460 --> 1:22:37.180
 hold in between of various duration,

1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:40.940
 but in general, 15 to 60 seconds is typical.

1:22:40.940 --> 1:22:43.400
 What happened physiologically?

1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:46.260
 This is one of the reasons I like this study.

1:22:46.260 --> 1:22:47.780
 What happened physiologically?

1:22:47.780 --> 1:22:49.460
 Well, a couple of things.

1:22:49.460 --> 1:22:52.740
 Of course, blood oxygenation drops.

1:22:52.740 --> 1:22:55.380
 You would expect that based on hyperventilation

1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:56.820
 and especially based on the exhale

1:22:56.820 --> 1:22:58.100
 of so much carbon dioxide.

1:22:58.100 --> 1:22:59.200
 We could explain why that is,

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:03.540
 but blood levels of oxygen drop.

1:23:03.540 --> 1:23:08.540
 The pH, the alkalinity of the body goes way up.

1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:10.100
 This is very interesting.

1:23:10.100 --> 1:23:11.400
 If you look up this paper,

1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:13.500
 you can look at figure one, panel C.

1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:14.700
 The pH goes way up.

1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:15.800
 People become alkaline.

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:18.220
 You've heard before of alkaline water.

1:23:18.220 --> 1:23:19.060
 I hate to say this.

1:23:19.060 --> 1:23:20.560
 I probably lose some friends for this,

1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:21.860
 but yeah, don't waste your money

1:23:21.860 --> 1:23:24.100
 on drinking alkaline water.

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:27.380
 You can't really shift the alkalinity of your body.

1:23:27.380 --> 1:23:30.300
 There are cases where some compartment in your body

1:23:30.300 --> 1:23:31.920
 needs to be more alkaline than the rest.

1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:33.500
 Your gut is a different alkalinity

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:35.780
 than other areas of your body, et cetera,

1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:38.260
 but ingesting high alkaline water

1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:40.460
 isn't going to shift your overall alkalinity.

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:43.120
 If someone can send me a quality reference

1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:44.900
 that shows different,

1:23:44.900 --> 1:23:46.420
 then I'm happy to revise that statement,

1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:48.460
 but in any case,

1:23:48.460 --> 1:23:50.860
 doing that pattern of breathing that I just described

1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:52.500
 greatly increases the pH.

1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:53.700
 Greatly, I should say,

1:23:53.700 --> 1:23:55.320
 it doesn't send it off into dangerous levels.

1:23:55.320 --> 1:23:57.400
 It takes it from 7.4 to 7.6,

1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:01.220
 which is a significant increase in alkalinity.

1:24:01.220 --> 1:24:03.460
 So as pH levels,

1:24:03.460 --> 1:24:04.580
 for those of you who remember high school

1:24:04.580 --> 1:24:06.060
 or college chemistry,

1:24:06.060 --> 1:24:08.700
 as the numbers on the pH go down,

1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:10.140
 you're becoming more acidic.

1:24:10.140 --> 1:24:12.980
 As they go up, you're becoming more alkaline, okay?

1:24:12.980 --> 1:24:14.060
 Or more basic.

1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:18.900
 So the subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6 during the breathing,

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:20.660
 and then afterwards it returned to normal.

1:24:20.660 --> 1:24:22.780
 But that shift in alkalinity

1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:24.900
 is thought to be important here.

1:24:24.900 --> 1:24:25.860
 So what's going on here?

1:24:25.860 --> 1:24:30.660
 How is the breathing leading to these shifts in,

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:35.020
 or I should say reduction in inflammatory cytokines

1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:38.740
 and an increase in the liberation

1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:41.220
 of these anti-inflammatory cytokines?

1:24:41.220 --> 1:24:43.420
 Well, the authors make some good arguments

1:24:43.420 --> 1:24:47.740
 as to why it's not the shift in pH per se,

1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:51.980
 or the shift in carbon dioxide levels in the blood,

1:24:51.980 --> 1:24:55.540
 but rather it's the release of epinephrine.

1:24:55.540 --> 1:24:57.700
 And there's some good reason to believe why that's the case.

1:24:57.700 --> 1:24:59.140
 It's beyond the scope of this discussion,

1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:02.260
 but that it's actually the release of epinephrine,

1:25:02.260 --> 1:25:03.780
 AKA adrenaline,

1:25:03.780 --> 1:25:07.140
 that's causing this reduction in inflammation.

1:25:07.140 --> 1:25:10.580
 And that's actually supported

1:25:10.580 --> 1:25:13.340
 by something that you've probably experienced before,

1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:15.140
 which is if you've ever worked, worked, worked,

1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:16.020
 worked really hard,

1:25:16.020 --> 1:25:18.180
 or you've been a caretaker for somebody else

1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:20.100
 or studying for exams,

1:25:20.100 --> 1:25:21.540
 and people around you are getting sick

1:25:21.540 --> 1:25:23.660
 and you're just powering through it

1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:24.620
 and you're not getting sick,

1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:27.540
 but then you stop, you turn in your final exam,

1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:29.880
 you stop taking care of somebody else,

1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:31.340
 or you finally stop and rest,

1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:34.020
 or you go on vacation and then you get sick.

1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:37.860
 Well, you've just experienced the effect

1:25:37.860 --> 1:25:40.140
 that adrenaline, epinephrine can have

1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:42.000
 in activating your immune system

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.020
 by way of the nervous system

1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:47.660
 in order to keep fighting and combating infection.

1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:49.440
 And that brings us to a larger theme,

1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:52.940
 which is that stress and combating infection or a wound

1:25:52.940 --> 1:25:56.460
 is not one unique system.

1:25:56.460 --> 1:25:57.740
 It's the same stress system

1:25:57.740 --> 1:26:00.060
 that you use to combat psychological stress.

1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:01.780
 So when you're very, very stressed,

1:26:01.780 --> 1:26:03.620
 at least in the short term,

1:26:03.620 --> 1:26:06.640
 because you release so much adrenaline and epinephrine,

1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:09.300
 you're actually better able to combat infections

1:26:09.300 --> 1:26:10.680
 and you reduce inflammation

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:12.580
 and the whole feeling lousy response, right?

1:26:12.580 --> 1:26:14.780
 Remember, reduced flu-like symptoms here.

1:26:14.780 --> 1:26:18.060
 So this pattern of breathing is actually a very useful tool.

1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:19.920
 And I confess, I use this pattern of breathing

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:22.300
 anytime I am at the initial stages

1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:23.760
 of getting some sort of bug.

1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:26.400
 If I feel like I've been running myself ragged,

1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:28.420
 or if I somehow, for whatever reason,

1:26:28.420 --> 1:26:29.720
 have a tickle in my throat,

1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:31.900
 or I have that kind of sensation in my nose,

1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:35.300
 like I might've caught a bug of some sort,

1:26:35.300 --> 1:26:37.740
 I will do this pattern of breathing.

1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:39.540
 I've been doing it consistently, gosh,

1:26:39.540 --> 1:26:42.380
 for the last four years or more.

1:26:42.380 --> 1:26:45.140
 You know, now this is just anecdotal reports,

1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:47.880
 but I find that it allows me indeed

1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:51.700
 to either have those early symptoms disappear,

1:26:51.700 --> 1:26:54.540
 or it allows me to just kind of push through

1:26:54.540 --> 1:26:55.740
 and harder longer.

1:26:55.740 --> 1:26:59.260
 I don't suggest people continue to push through

1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:00.580
 exposure to infections.

1:27:00.580 --> 1:27:03.080
 Obviously you don't want to infect other people,

1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:04.340
 nor do you want to crash

1:27:04.340 --> 1:27:07.220
 and suddenly get a massive illness of some sort

1:27:07.220 --> 1:27:09.100
 because you stopped doing this breathing.

1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:10.780
 But I do think it's a useful tool.

1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:13.140
 It's a purely behavioral intervention

1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:15.160
 that has been shown here,

1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:17.800
 and now there are additional studies on the way

1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:21.260
 to enhance the function of your immune system

1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:22.700
 and to reduce inflammation.

1:27:22.700 --> 1:27:24.420
 And this is to me,

1:27:24.420 --> 1:27:28.820
 one of the most concrete examples of a zero cost tool

1:27:28.820 --> 1:27:32.260
 that bridges the activation of the nervous system

1:27:32.260 --> 1:27:35.380
 through breathing with the immune system

1:27:35.380 --> 1:27:38.180
 by way of releasing adrenaline

1:27:38.180 --> 1:27:41.660
 and thereby reducing the terrible effects

1:27:41.660 --> 1:27:45.600
 or feelings of lousiness from a,

1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:48.020
 in this case, an E. coli infection.

1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:52.220
 Now I'd like to focus on a couple of important points

1:27:52.220 --> 1:27:55.800
 that I haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere,

1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:58.620
 which is that the hyperventilation

1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:01.640
 and the breath retention are both important.

1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:03.780
 So you can't simply hyperventilate

1:28:03.780 --> 1:28:08.780
 to get this effect at the level of epinephrine release

1:28:09.180 --> 1:28:11.820
 and reduction in inflammatory cytokines.

1:28:11.820 --> 1:28:15.220
 It's been shown before that the hyperventilation phase

1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:16.580
 and the hypoxia,

1:28:16.580 --> 1:28:19.900
 which is a kind of low oxygen saturation

1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:21.980
 due to the breath retention,

1:28:21.980 --> 1:28:26.080
 they both combine to increase epinephrine adrenaline levels.

1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:30.000
 So you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.220
 and then the retention, 25 or 30 breaths,

1:28:32.220 --> 1:28:33.060
 then the retention,

1:28:33.060 --> 1:28:34.740
 meaning that the exhale with the breath hold

1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:36.700
 in order to get the full effect.

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:39.780
 I also want to provide a critical cautionary note.

1:28:39.780 --> 1:28:43.700
 Don't do this anywhere near water or while driving a car.

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:45.580
 These things might seem kind of obvious,

1:28:45.580 --> 1:28:49.700
 but obviously in the off chance that you black out

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:51.260
 or something like that, it could be disastrous.

1:28:51.260 --> 1:28:53.340
 So please be careful.

1:28:53.340 --> 1:28:56.540
 And again, don't try and push the breath hold.

1:28:56.540 --> 1:28:58.940
 The moment you feel the impulse to breathe, just breathe.

1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:01.020
 And it did seem that the three rounds

1:29:01.020 --> 1:29:03.940
 of 25 to 30 breaths with interventions,

1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:06.600
 excuse me, with breath hold retentions in between

1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:08.500
 was the ideal protocol.

1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:11.580
 There's one last very interesting feature of this study

1:29:11.580 --> 1:29:12.940
 that I want to emphasize.

1:29:12.940 --> 1:29:15.460
 And that was that they actually measured

1:29:15.460 --> 1:29:17.980
 the so-called catecholamine concentrations.

1:29:17.980 --> 1:29:20.200
 Catecholamines are things like dopamine,

1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:21.960
 epinephrine, norepinephrine.

1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:25.240
 These are chemicals in your nervous system

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:28.580
 and body that promotes states of alertness.

1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:29.420
 Dopamine, of course,

1:29:29.420 --> 1:29:32.720
 part of the reward and motivation pathways.

1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:36.100
 They explored the levels of these molecules in blood,

1:29:36.100 --> 1:29:41.140
 in plasma, during and after this breathing protocol.

1:29:41.140 --> 1:29:42.900
 And as interesting, as I mentioned,

1:29:42.900 --> 1:29:45.180
 before epinephrine showed robust increases

1:29:45.180 --> 1:29:46.520
 compared to the control group,

1:29:46.520 --> 1:29:49.480
 norepinephrine, significant increases occurred

1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:51.260
 in the breathing group,

1:29:51.260 --> 1:29:53.660
 but in the cyclic hyperventilation,

1:29:53.660 --> 1:29:57.900
 retention breathing group, of course, but less so.

1:29:57.900 --> 1:30:01.580
 And dopamine levels actually dropped somewhat.

1:30:01.580 --> 1:30:03.220
 But this is very interesting

1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:07.500
 because there's a new and emerging literature

1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:12.500
 largely from ISA, A-Y-S-A, Rolz Lab in Israel.

1:30:13.380 --> 1:30:15.620
 What her laboratory has shown is that

1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:22.300
 motivational state and mindset has a powerful impact

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:25.200
 on various aspects of the immune system

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:27.220
 that were thought to be independent

1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:29.380
 of the brain and mind and thinking.

1:30:29.380 --> 1:30:32.840
 So this brings us back to something that we discussed

1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:34.220
 at the very beginning of this episode,

1:30:34.220 --> 1:30:37.140
 which is that 20, 30 years ago,

1:30:37.140 --> 1:30:39.420
 the idea that you could heal the body with the mind

1:30:39.420 --> 1:30:41.500
 was considered kind of quackery.

1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:45.300
 I think that there was an intervening period up until now

1:30:45.300 --> 1:30:46.580
 where people might've said,

1:30:46.580 --> 1:30:49.180
 sure, if you're stressed out, it's going to make things worse

1:30:49.180 --> 1:30:50.460
 I mean, I think everyone agrees

1:30:50.460 --> 1:30:53.440
 that stress makes everything worse at some level,

1:30:54.280 --> 1:30:56.580
 outcomes to neurodegeneration,

1:30:56.580 --> 1:31:00.480
 performance in physical endeavors and mental endeavors.

1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:04.340
 If stress is too high for too long,

1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:07.460
 people experience different challenges

1:31:07.460 --> 1:31:09.900
 and essentially every major psychiatric disorder,

1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:11.020
 everything suffers.

1:31:11.020 --> 1:31:13.860
 But in the short term, stress can actually be beneficial

1:31:13.860 --> 1:31:15.180
 in the ways that we just described.

1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:18.220
 And stress, if we break it down

1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:20.860
 is really a neurochemical state, right?

1:31:20.860 --> 1:31:23.260
 It's the release of these catecholamines.

1:31:23.260 --> 1:31:26.720
 And what ISA, Rolz's laboratory has shown

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:29.880
 is that when the so-called dopamine system,

1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:31.220
 and at several episodes I described

1:31:31.220 --> 1:31:32.720
 there are multiple dopamine systems,

1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:35.260
 but the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway

1:31:35.260 --> 1:31:38.800
 involving areas like the nucleus accumbens, et cetera.

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:43.540
 When the reward system that's associated with dopamine

1:31:43.540 --> 1:31:45.980
 and norepinephrine is activated,

1:31:47.220 --> 1:31:50.900
 you see incredible effects, including for instance,

1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:55.940
 highly significant reduction in tumor size in cancers.

1:31:55.940 --> 1:31:57.520
 Now, why would that be?

1:31:57.520 --> 1:32:02.520
 How is it that mindset dopamine and tumors growth

1:32:02.520 --> 1:32:03.580
 are somehow linked?

1:32:04.940 --> 1:32:06.200
 We now know how this occurs,

1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:09.180
 largely through the incredible work of ISA, Rolz and others.

1:32:09.180 --> 1:32:13.120
 So now I'd like to turn our focus to how it is specifically

1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:17.280
 that certain mindsets impact the immune system

1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:18.460
 in ways that we can actually point

1:32:18.460 --> 1:32:20.160
 to specific biological pathways

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:23.720
 and also specific protocols related to mindset.

1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:27.640
 I guess a simple way to frame all this would be to say

1:32:27.640 --> 1:32:30.160
 that most of us are aware that yes, indeed,

1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:32.340
 you can worry yourself sick.

1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:33.180
 We've been told that.

1:32:33.180 --> 1:32:35.120
 You're going to worry yourself sick.

1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:37.800
 And actually there was a paper published in Science,

1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:39.920
 again, one of the top three journals out there,

1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:43.120
 the top three really being Nature, Science and Cell.

1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:45.520
 And then other, of course, excellent journals exist,

1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:49.440
 but this was a paper that came out in Science last year.

1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:53.520
 First author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A,

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.480
 describing psychogenic stress and fever.

1:32:58.480 --> 1:33:01.360
 So this was looking or asking the question,

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:05.060
 are there areas of the brain that actually underlie

1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:08.160
 this notion that we can worry ourselves sick?

1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:09.840
 And they discovered a new pathway

1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:12.640
 and they were able to both activate this pathway

1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:16.240
 independent of worry and stress and see illness occur.

1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:18.160
 And they were able to inhibit this pathway,

1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:20.220
 block activity in this neural pathway

1:33:20.220 --> 1:33:22.840
 and prevent psychogenic fever

1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:26.120
 and the worrying of oneself sick.

1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:29.760
 So they were able to do this in a very controlled way.

1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:31.880
 I'll just mention the pathway in case

1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:34.260
 you want to look it up in more detail.

1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:37.520
 This is a corticolimbic pathway.

1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:39.980
 So for just to orient us,

1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:42.720
 the cortex is more or less the outer shell of the brain.

1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:44.560
 It's involved in thinking and sensation

1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:46.520
 and perceptions and learning

1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:49.040
 and maintenance of a lot of memories are stored there.

1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:52.760
 We all hear that you learn and remember in the hippocampus,

1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:55.040
 that's the initial side of learning and memory.

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:56.620
 But then that information, believe it or not,

1:33:56.620 --> 1:33:57.800
 is passed off to the cortex

1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:00.040
 where it's stored in kind of a long, long-term

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:01.840
 hard drive type storage.

1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:06.840
 So the corticolimbic pathway is one in which your thoughts,

1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:11.200
 your prior experiences can literally in a structural way,

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:13.720
 feed down onto the areas of the brain

1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:15.800
 that control very basal processes,

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.080
 including temperature regulation.

1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:20.280
 So this is a corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway.

1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:21.680
 We talked earlier about the hypothalamus

1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:22.660
 is controlling temperature

1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:25.160
 and a lot of sickness-related behavior, right?

1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:26.840
 Remember vagus up to the hypothalamus

1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:30.000
 and all the sleep more, less appetite, fever, okay?

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:31.400
 That's all in the hypothalamus.

1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:36.400
 This is a top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway,

1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:38.040
 and it has a fancy name.

1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:42.880
 It's the dorsopeduncular cortex, dorsotonia tecta.

1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:44.880
 The short of that is the DPDTT.

1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:46.920
 So let's just call it the DPDTT

1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:49.800
 to the dorsomedial hypothalamus.

1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:51.160
 Not a lot of Ds.

1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:52.480
 It shouldn't mean anything.

1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:55.160
 Doesn't really matter what we call it,

1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:59.040
 but what's important is conceptually,

1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:02.400
 it's a pathway that originates in sites of the brain

1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:04.800
 that are associated with thinking,

1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:07.440
 with emotion and with prior history,

1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:09.380
 and feeds directly into an area of the brain

1:35:09.380 --> 1:35:11.460
 that's involved in basic physiological,

1:35:11.460 --> 1:35:13.640
 subconsciously controlled processes.

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:15.280
 So that's incredible, right?

1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:18.300
 And it points to a physical pathway

1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:20.600
 by which the way we think about something

1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:23.720
 changes something core about our physiology.

1:35:23.720 --> 1:35:25.680
 Now, in some ways that shouldn't be surprising, right?

1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:27.360
 If you think about something that excites you,

1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:28.820
 your heart rate can increase.

1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:30.040
 You think about something that terrifies you,

1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:31.060
 your heart rate can increase.

1:35:31.060 --> 1:35:33.560
 So the idea that thinking controls our physiology

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:35.280
 is not a new concept at all,

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.420
 but somehow human beings,

1:35:38.420 --> 1:35:41.360
 we have been challenged with the idea

1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:44.640
 that we could actually think ourselves into being sick.

1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:48.160
 But this paper from Kataoka shows that

1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:52.320
 if you expose somebody to a psychological stress,

1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:56.440
 you can actually activate this pathway and create a fever.

1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:57.280
 And how did they do that?

1:35:57.280 --> 1:35:59.720
 Well, you can do this by exposing subjects

1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:02.920
 to a very stressful real event,

1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:05.040
 and you cue it through associative learning.

1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:07.960
 So maybe like my pilot V5s, which I love so much,

1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:10.280
 we could traumatize me to the pilot V5.

1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:11.880
 If I had some horrible experience happen to me

1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:14.480
 while I'm looking at and concentrating on the pilot V5,

1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:15.980
 then you take away the horrible experience,

1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:17.240
 you give me the pilot V5,

1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:19.880
 and I start to experience a lot of the symptoms

1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:22.360
 associated with that terrible event.

1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:23.320
 They were able to do this

1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:26.600
 using sickness-inducing stimuli and so forth.

1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.280
 They did all the various derivations

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:33.100
 and identified this pathway that when activated,

1:36:33.100 --> 1:36:35.180
 even in the absence of some horrible event,

1:36:35.180 --> 1:36:39.800
 could create fever and illness-like behavior and so forth.

1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:42.540
 And if they blocked certain stations

1:36:42.540 --> 1:36:44.560
 along this neural pathway, they could block that effect.

1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:48.320
 So this is really concrete evidence, proof, if you will,

1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:51.280
 that there are dedicated pathways in the mammalian brain,

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.760
 your brain and mine,

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:55.620
 that allow us to turn thoughts into illness.

1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:58.240
 That's kind of a depressing idea.

1:36:58.240 --> 1:36:59.520
 What about the inverse?

1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:02.260
 What about turning thoughts into health?

1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:04.580
 Well, that's the work of ISA roles.

1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:10.600
 They explored the well-established psychological phenomenon

1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:15.600
 that when cancer patients or very ill people

1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:18.600
 or people who are suffering from very debilitating injuries,

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:23.600
 when they had or when people had or reported a sense of hope,

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:26.660
 their rates of recovery were much higher, right?

1:37:26.660 --> 1:37:29.640
 Sounds very subjective.

1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:32.040
 But what is a sense of hope?

1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:34.840
 A sense of hope is a sense of the future.

1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:36.960
 A sense of the future is tightly associated

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:38.620
 with the dopamine system.

1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:40.940
 Dopamine, again, being this molecule of reward

1:37:40.940 --> 1:37:42.880
 and motivation and movement,

1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:47.880
 but movement and motivation are about things

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:49.800
 that are beyond the confines of our skin

1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:51.400
 and are about the future.

1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:54.120
 And so what they've discovered and through other studies

1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:57.360
 from other groups have discovered is that stimulation

1:37:57.360 --> 1:37:58.560
 of the dopamine pathway,

1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:02.120
 either simply by thinking about a future,

1:38:03.100 --> 1:38:04.380
 ideally a positive future,

1:38:04.380 --> 1:38:07.060
 but thinking about a positive future leads to activation

1:38:07.060 --> 1:38:09.560
 of this so-called mesolimbic reward pathway

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:11.720
 and could reduce the size of tumors,

1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:13.560
 could accelerate wound healing,

1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:18.360
 could greatly accelerate the passage from a state of illness

1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:21.200
 to a state of health and wellbeing.

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:25.720
 So there are many, many studies now starting to wick out

1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:27.240
 related to this.

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:30.700
 There's also the idea that augmenting the dopamine system

1:38:30.700 --> 1:38:33.200
 can increase the rate of healing.

1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:35.680
 And so there are individuals out there who opt,

1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:38.820
 for instance, to take things that increase dopamine.

1:38:38.820 --> 1:38:42.240
 Now, obviously drugs of abuse would not be a good idea

1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:44.240
 in this context, even though they increase dopamine,

1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:45.300
 they lead to big crashes,

1:38:45.300 --> 1:38:48.000
 they have addictive properties, et cetera.

1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000
 I've talked before on this podcast about things

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:53.440
 like L-tyrosine, take it anywhere from 500

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:57.400
 to 750 milligrams can increase dopamine

1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:00.100
 because tyrosine is a dopamine precursor, of course,

1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:02.080
 things like micuna purines, which are L-DOPA,

1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:04.200
 the immediate precursor to dopamine.

1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:06.560
 Some of these will lead to somewhat of a crash

1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:08.400
 in certain individuals,

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:10.560
 other people tolerate them a little bit better.

1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:11.820
 Again, you have to talk to your doctor,

1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:13.120
 you have to figure out what's right for you.

1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:16.200
 If you have bipolar or mania or schizophrenia,

1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:19.240
 these things are, I would not recommend them at all.

1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:20.360
 I'm not recommending them all,

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:22.600
 I'm just mentioning them for potential exploration

1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:24.200
 if it's safe and right for you.

1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:28.400
 But the point is this, the dopamine system when activated

1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:30.140
 can accelerate healing.

1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:34.160
 It can accelerate the recovery from injury of all kinds.

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:38.760
 And that shouldn't come as a mystery or surprise result

1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:41.920
 to us, it's because this reward pathway

1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:45.160
 and the fact that it's related to a sense of the future

1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:48.400
 seems to liberate entire systems within the body

1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:52.760
 that make inflammatory cytokines go down

1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:55.560
 and anti-inflammatory cytokines go up

1:39:55.560 --> 1:40:00.300
 exactly as was demonstrated in the beautiful PNAS study

1:40:00.300 --> 1:40:04.000
 where breathing, cyclic hyperventilation

1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.600
 was used to increase epinephrine, increase norepinephrine,

1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:10.760
 and to augment the catecholamine system.

1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:14.560
 So I think that the bridges between these studies

1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:15.400
 are really relevant.

1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:16.500
 In one case, I'm talking about

1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:19.340
 potentially taking an over-the-counter compound

1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:21.240
 to increase dopamine to accelerate healing.

1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.340
 In another case, we're talking about using breathing.

1:40:24.340 --> 1:40:27.620
 There's also the use of cold water exposure

1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:28.540
 to increase dopamine.

1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:30.260
 I talked about this several episodes ago,

1:40:30.260 --> 1:40:32.000
 but it's been shown that cold water,

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.960
 immersing oneself in cold water up to the neck or so,

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:37.000
 how cold, well, it depends on what you can tolerate,

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.280
 but uncomfortably cold,

1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:40.160
 but not so cold that you become hypothermic,

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:42.840
 but where it's challenging to get in,

1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:46.240
 but you can stay there for three to 10 minutes or so

1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:50.440
 has been shown to lead to very significant

1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:53.780
 doubling or more of baseline dopamine levels

1:40:53.780 --> 1:40:56.840
 and epinephrine levels that go on for several hours.

1:40:56.840 --> 1:41:01.200
 This may be the basis for why people will do cold showers

1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:03.080
 or ice baths and then get into a sauna.

1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.840
 So what's called contrast, cold heat contrast therapy

1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:09.280
 as a way to augment these neurotransmitters.

1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:11.160
 Today, we've been talking about how these neurotransmitters

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:14.920
 can be used to enhance the function of the immune system.

1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:17.840
 And so just keep in mind that anytime you're talking about

1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:19.280
 increasing neurotransmitter levels,

1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:22.160
 that can be done pharmacologically through supplementation,

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:24.520
 or it can be done behaviorally through exposure

1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:26.320
 to cold water, for instance,

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:29.200
 or it can be done even just simply by breathing

1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:31.280
 in a particular way, cyclic hyperventilation

1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:32.860
 followed by retention.

1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:36.400
 The catecholamines, noradrenaline, dopamine,

1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:39.740
 and norepinephrine are the bridge of activation

1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:42.360
 for the immune system and the nervous system.

1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:44.460
 They are the way that the nervous system calls out

1:41:44.460 --> 1:41:48.000
 to the immune system, aha, we have a problem,

1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.240
 we need to counter this.

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:51.360
 So you can think of them,

1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:54.840
 them meaning dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine

1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:59.840
 as being able to deploy larger amounts of immune cells,

1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:02.060
 all the types of immune cells that we talked about

1:42:02.060 --> 1:42:04.080
 at the beginning of the episode.

1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:06.940
 Okay, so thus far, we've been discussing

1:42:06.940 --> 1:42:09.840
 how one can prevent getting sick

1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:12.700
 or when one starts to feel ill,

1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:14.680
 how one might be able to shorten the course

1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:17.380
 of that infection by ramping up the activity

1:42:17.380 --> 1:42:18.940
 of the immune system.

1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:22.400
 But what about when you're already experiencing symptoms,

1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:25.800
 the runny nose, stuffed up nose, congestion,

1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:27.840
 headache, et cetera?

1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:30.380
 Well, there are many ways to address that

1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:31.560
 at the symptom level.

1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:34.040
 You're probably aware of all the over-the-counter

1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:39.040
 medications, many of which focus on the epinephrine system.

1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:43.120
 Things that are of the Sudafed variety prevent

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:46.040
 or reduce congestion because of the way

1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:48.500
 that they cause release of epinephrine

1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:52.160
 and some of the effects on dilating the bronchioles

1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:54.500
 and dilating the nasal passages and so forth.

1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:57.440
 I'm not going to speak to whether or not

1:42:57.440 --> 1:42:59.120
 those are good or bad choices.

1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:02.120
 They do have a couple of effects that are not so great

1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:05.640
 for the course of treating the underlying cause,

1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:09.120
 which are, first of all, they can cause dehydration.

1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:10.840
 So you have to make sure that you're hydrating well,

1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:13.520
 both fluids and electrolytes.

1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:16.800
 And they also can interfere with sleep

1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:20.320
 because as I've talked about in the episodes on sleep,

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.680
 one of the hallmarks of deep sleep and in particular,

1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:27.160
 REM sleep is that epinephrine adrenaline levels are low.

1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:29.800
 This is what allows you to have intense,

1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:33.740
 often very emotionally laden dreams during REM sleep

1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:36.320
 and not act those out.

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:40.080
 And low adrenaline epinephrine during REM sleep

1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:43.320
 is basically a signature, a neurochemical signature

1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:45.080
 of the REM sleep state, which is so vital

1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:48.120
 for emotional and physical repair and so forth.

1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:50.440
 So the fact that they can inhibit sleep,

1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:52.520
 the fact that they can cause dehydration,

1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:53.440
 the fact that they can make people

1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:55.240
 feel kind of lightheaded and jittery

1:43:55.240 --> 1:43:59.000
 makes them not terrific choices for a number of people.

1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.120
 There is an interesting alternative choice.

1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:04.080
 And when I say alternative, I do mean alternative.

1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:06.620
 The choice I'm referring to is spirulina,

1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:09.000
 which is actually a form of algae.

1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:12.000
 Years ago, I think when I first heard about spirulina,

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.240
 it sounded very much of the kind of 1970s, 80s,

1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:17.240
 health food store variety.

1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:19.920
 It seemed really kind of mystical and wacky,

1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:22.400
 but actually now there are some really nice studies

1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:25.200
 and some data and also an understanding of the mechanism

1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:27.960
 by which spirulina can have potent effects

1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:29.880
 in reducing what's called rhinitis,

1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:33.400
 which is a fancy word for congestion of the nose

1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:34.780
 and inflammation of the nose.

1:44:34.780 --> 1:44:39.780
 Basically, anytime you hear a word that includes itis,

1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:41.800
 at least if it's in the medical or health context,

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:44.160
 it generally means inflammation of some tissue.

1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:48.620
 So rhinitis just being inflammation of the nasal passages,

1:44:48.620 --> 1:44:50.480
 but that's one of the most uncomfortable symptoms

1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:52.040
 of any kind of infection.

1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:54.300
 So there are two studies I'd like to highlight

1:44:54.300 --> 1:44:55.140
 just very quickly.

1:44:55.140 --> 1:44:58.180
 One is the effects of spirulina on allergic rhinitis,

1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:00.000
 and the other is a clinical comparison

1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:03.000
 to the efficacy of spirulina platensis,

1:45:05.280 --> 1:45:06.600
 that's a technical name,

1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.600
 and cetirizine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:13.560
 These looked at humans, so this is not a mouse study,

1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:14.820
 this is a study on humans.

1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:18.760
 Both sexes, so males and females,

1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:22.240
 in one case looking at 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects,

1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:24.680
 the other 65 subjects, so a decent number of subjects,

1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:27.440
 randomized trial, double-blind,

1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:32.440
 both cases saw significant decreases in nasal obstruction,

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:36.200
 improved ability to smell, improved sleep,

1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:39.980
 daily working, cytokine,

1:45:39.980 --> 1:45:42.280
 inflammatory cytokines were reduced as well,

1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:44.420
 reduction in nasal itching,

1:45:44.420 --> 1:45:47.520
 all the stuff that you'd like to experience, I can imagine,

1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:50.560
 after taking two grams, two grams, not milligrams,

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:52.740
 but two grams of spirulina,

1:45:52.740 --> 1:45:55.180
 sometimes had to be taken for a short while

1:45:55.180 --> 1:45:56.720
 before the effect kicked in.

1:45:56.720 --> 1:45:59.440
 So that's pretty impressive, I would say,

1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:01.280
 but it doesn't really speak to mechanism,

1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:03.720
 but in exploring the underlying mechanisms

1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:08.260
 for spirulina's effects on reducing rhinitis,

1:46:08.260 --> 1:46:10.680
 it's interesting to find that spirulina

1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:14.800
 actually can inhibit the formation and or activity

1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:19.520
 of so-called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells.

1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:21.580
 We haven't talked a lot about mast cells,

1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:23.760
 but they are a very interesting cell type

1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:25.560
 in the immune response,

1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.480
 essentially what they are, little packets of histamine,

1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:34.480
 and when we have some sort of injury

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:38.440
 or irritant, rather, to the skin,

1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:41.080
 so a mosquito bite, for instance, or poison oak

1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:44.820
 or poison ivy, something that causes an itch

1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:47.040
 or something that causes inflammation internally,

1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:48.540
 doesn't just have to be on the skin,

1:46:48.540 --> 1:46:50.400
 these mast cells are these little bubbles

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:52.800
 that contain histamine that go to that site

1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:56.160
 and release their histaminergic contents

1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:58.520
 and cause swelling and inflammation

1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:01.640
 of whatever cells are affected locally.

1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:03.000
 That's caused, you might think,

1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.960
 well, why would I want to have a mechanism in my body

1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:06.720
 that would cause swelling and inflammation?

1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:11.120
 Ah, well, then those cells in turn send out cytokine signals

1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:15.000
 that recruit the very cell types that we were talking about

1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.640
 way back at the beginning of the episode,

1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:19.480
 the cells that are characteristic

1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:21.740
 of the innate immune system that come in,

1:47:21.740 --> 1:47:24.280
 the macrophages and the other types of cells

1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.960
 that will come in and gobble up the foreign invaders

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:29.880
 or will help sequester and move away,

1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:34.040
 say, the poison from a bite or from whatever irritant.

1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:36.880
 Again, it doesn't just have to be at the skin surface.

1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:39.720
 I'm describing an example at the skin.

1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:43.140
 For instance, if you've ever had hives of any kind,

1:47:43.140 --> 1:47:47.040
 that almost certainly involved mast cells.

1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:49.660
 So when you take an antihistamine, antihistamine,

1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:53.360
 in order to deal with seasonal allergies, for instance,

1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.760
 you're dealing, you're, excuse me,

1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:58.680
 you're taking a compound that's reducing histamines

1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:01.320
 in mast cells, and spirulina has also been used

1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:04.880
 quite effectively as a way to treat seasonal allergies

1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:06.280
 and some of the symptomology,

1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:09.040
 equally on par with some of the major prescription

1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:11.360
 and over-the-counter drugs for that.

1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:13.960
 One cautionary note, spirulina does,

1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:16.600
 can carry some side effects for people

1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:19.080
 that are, have a genetic mutation

1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:20.320
 leading to something called PKU.

1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:21.400
 These people know who they are.

1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:24.600
 They're very sensitive to phenylalanine.

1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:26.920
 These same people cannot drink any sort of

1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:29.320
 nutrients to eat or diet soda for reasons

1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:30.960
 that they understand it could be quite dangerous.

1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:33.280
 It's a rare genetic disorder, but nonetheless,

1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:36.360
 spirulina can be an issue for those people.

1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:40.280
 For most people, the side effect profile is pretty minimal.

1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:42.040
 And just to be clear, I don't have any relationship

1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:43.720
 to a spirulina company or anything.

1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:46.440
 I just find it interesting that there are these compounds

1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:49.040
 that sound rather, forgive the phrase,

1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:53.480
 but rather new agey because they come from a algae,

1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:55.660
 from a plant, but when you look at the underlying mechanism,

1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:56.960
 it makes perfect sense.

1:48:56.960 --> 1:48:59.440
 So that's often what we like to point out here

1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:03.300
 is that if there are these so-called alternative therapies,

1:49:03.300 --> 1:49:05.000
 alternative because most people haven't heard of them,

1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.000
 it's always nice if they map to a specific logical mechanism

1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:09.840
 and framework by which that compound would work

1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:11.480
 as opposed to just some anecdote of,

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:13.480
 oh, I hear spirulina is great for allergies.

1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:14.540
 Well, now we know why.

1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:17.280
 It inhibits mast cells and histaminergic mast cells

1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:18.760
 in particular.

1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:22.320
 Earlier, I mentioned a new and very exciting study

1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:24.520
 published as a full article in Nature.

1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:28.080
 Full article means that it is a major finding.

1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:30.680
 It, at the journal Nature, they have letters,

1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:32.080
 which are important findings.

1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:34.000
 They're still very high stringency

1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.560
 for getting a letter in Nature published,

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:38.760
 but the full articles,

1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:41.880
 generally there's only one or two per issue

1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:44.680
 in the weekly edition of Nature.

1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:47.720
 And just last week, there was a very exciting article

1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:51.360
 published from Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School.

1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:53.300
 Chufu, I've known for a number of years.

1:49:53.300 --> 1:49:54.760
 His group has done phenomenal work

1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:57.480
 on the mechanisms of itch and pain

1:49:57.480 --> 1:49:59.520
 and discovering some of the receptors and pathways

1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:00.360
 for itch and pain.

1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:02.400
 And more recently, they've been exploring

1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:05.600
 the mechanistic basis of acupuncture.

1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:07.480
 And the title of the article

1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:10.680
 is a neuroanatomical basis for electroacupuncture

1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:13.120
 to drive the vagal adrenal axis.

1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.160
 And while that's a mouthful,

1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:18.520
 now most all of you are probably familiar

1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:21.480
 with what I mean when I say vagal adrenal axis.

1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.480
 Vagal, meaning of the vagus,

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:25.260
 and adrenal of the adrenal glands.

1:50:25.260 --> 1:50:27.920
 And so perhaps we should not be surprised,

1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:30.200
 although excited nonetheless,

1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:35.200
 that Wen-Chufu's lab looked at stimulation

1:50:35.340 --> 1:50:38.640
 of the body with so-called electroacupuncture.

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:39.800
 So these are needles

1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.560
 where a small bit of electrical current,

1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:46.120
 low level of electrical current is passed into the needle

1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:47.520
 and therefore into the body.

1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:50.160
 They located sites on the body

1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:52.480
 that can increase inflammation

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:55.080
 by way of releasing inflammatory cytokines.

1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:57.600
 These areas included the abdomen.

1:50:57.600 --> 1:50:59.160
 And they found areas on the body,

1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:01.680
 such as the lower limbs,

1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:03.580
 the hind limbs in this case,

1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:07.340
 that can stimulate the vagal adrenal reflex

1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:10.740
 and can lead to reduced inflammation.

1:51:10.740 --> 1:51:12.560
 And what was really interesting

1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:14.400
 is that they figured out

1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:17.200
 that it was activation of nerve endings

1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:19.080
 that resided in the fascia.

1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:20.560
 I mentioned earlier what fascia is,

1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:21.440
 but just to remind you,

1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:25.180
 the fascia is a really thick sheath of tissue

1:51:25.180 --> 1:51:26.920
 that surrounds muscle.

1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:28.560
 If ever you've heard of rolfing,

1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:31.400
 rolfing is a form of very intense massage.

1:51:31.400 --> 1:51:32.320
 I've never had this done,

1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:33.200
 but I've heard about this.

1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:37.040
 It involves, among other things,

1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:40.800
 actually separating the muscle away from the fascia somewhat.

1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:43.440
 So it's a very, very deep tissue massage.

1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:44.600
 Actually, a good friend of mine

1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:47.320
 who had this done told me

1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:50.840
 that it was probably the most challenging experience

1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:52.800
 at physical experience that he'd ever been through

1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:54.220
 going through this rolfing procedure.

1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:57.120
 Maybe some of you have been rolfed, as they say,

1:51:57.120 --> 1:51:59.000
 and can report to the experience

1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.580
 whether or not it was pleasant or unpleasant

1:52:00.580 --> 1:52:02.100
 or you felt benefits or not.

1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:04.920
 In any case, this study isn't about rolfing per se,

1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:06.520
 but it is about the fascia.

1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:08.320
 And so what they discovered is

1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:10.500
 there's a specific population of neurons.

1:52:10.500 --> 1:52:13.120
 Those neurons have a name, as they often do in science.

1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:15.200
 Name isn't important, but if you want to look it up,

1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:20.200
 it's the Prok R2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2 neurons.

1:52:20.200 --> 1:52:22.620
 And they send a connection

1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:26.060
 deep into the limb fascial tissue, okay?

1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:27.860
 And then they send another connection.

1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:30.100
 The connections we're referring to are axons.

1:52:30.100 --> 1:52:33.140
 Neurons have axons, so a wire in one direction

1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.700
 that goes into the deep fascial tissue

1:52:35.700 --> 1:52:39.460
 of the lower limb and near the calf and thigh.

1:52:39.460 --> 1:52:44.020
 And then they send another wire up into the spinal cord

1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:46.860
 and to a region of the hindbrain

1:52:46.860 --> 1:52:48.380
 in the back of your brain, kind of near your neck,

1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:51.140
 called the medulla, in the medulla oblongata.

1:52:51.140 --> 1:52:53.540
 That neuron also has a name called the DMZ, doesn't matter.

1:52:53.540 --> 1:52:56.820
 And that neuron connects to the adrenal gland

1:52:56.820 --> 1:52:58.820
 to release our good old friends,

1:52:58.820 --> 1:53:02.800
 the catecholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine,

1:53:02.800 --> 1:53:06.300
 or norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine.

1:53:06.300 --> 1:53:11.300
 And their release causes a reduction in inflammation,

1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:13.660
 even in response to an injection

1:53:13.660 --> 1:53:15.140
 of something called lipopolysaccharide,

1:53:15.140 --> 1:53:16.360
 which can actually induce fever.

1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:17.260
 So what is all this saying?

1:53:17.260 --> 1:53:21.460
 This is saying that activation of the deep fascial tissue

1:53:21.460 --> 1:53:25.460
 causes a chain of neural reactions

1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:27.260
 that leads eventually to the release

1:53:27.260 --> 1:53:31.300
 of norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine,

1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:33.440
 and once again, lowers inflammation,

1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:35.860
 very much like the breathing study

1:53:35.860 --> 1:53:36.980
 that we talked about earlier

1:53:36.980 --> 1:53:39.660
 in the pattern of cyclic hyperventilation with retention,

1:53:39.660 --> 1:53:41.720
 leading to reductions in inflammation.

1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:43.300
 I can't tell you how happy this makes me.

1:53:43.300 --> 1:53:44.620
 I had nothing to do with this work,

1:53:44.620 --> 1:53:45.860
 but the reason it makes me happy

1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:49.340
 is because I have a particular fondness

1:53:49.340 --> 1:53:53.240
 for when practices that have existed for many centuries

1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:55.760
 or even thousands of years, such as acupuncture,

1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:57.700
 such as respiration work,

1:53:58.660 --> 1:54:00.940
 start to converge with some of the

1:54:00.940 --> 1:54:02.740
 hardcore mechanistic science.

1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.580
 And the reason this excites me

1:54:04.580 --> 1:54:06.320
 is not because we want to take science

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:09.340
 and erase the previous tools and methods

1:54:09.340 --> 1:54:11.660
 of these ancient practices, not at all.

1:54:11.660 --> 1:54:12.900
 And it certainly isn't the case

1:54:12.900 --> 1:54:15.820
 that we just want to name things or rename things

1:54:15.820 --> 1:54:17.140
 with modern science.

1:54:17.140 --> 1:54:20.840
 What's very exciting is when we can discover mechanism

1:54:20.840 --> 1:54:23.640
 that explains why certain practices work.

1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:28.440
 First of all, that validates those as legitimate practices,

1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:31.220
 maybe even insurance will start to cover them,

1:54:31.220 --> 1:54:33.060
 whereas maybe they previously had not.

1:54:33.060 --> 1:54:34.520
 I don't know what the current status is

1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:36.700
 for insurance coverage of acupuncture.

1:54:36.700 --> 1:54:38.460
 I'm guessing there are places that do it,

1:54:38.460 --> 1:54:40.400
 maybe others that don't.

1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:43.360
 I personally am not somebody who receives acupuncture.

1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:44.780
 I have in the past, but I'm,

1:54:44.780 --> 1:54:47.360
 it's not that I'm a particular fan of it,

1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:48.740
 but I think that there are a number of people

1:54:48.740 --> 1:54:49.760
 that have benefited from it.

1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:51.600
 So I think that's wonderful.

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:53.580
 Breath work and respiration work

1:54:53.580 --> 1:54:55.900
 is something that I've cultivated as a practice

1:54:55.900 --> 1:54:56.740
 over the years.

1:54:56.740 --> 1:54:58.860
 I mentioned earlier how I use it to push back

1:54:58.860 --> 1:55:00.700
 on incoming infections and so forth.

1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:04.340
 And now that doesn't sound like total,

1:55:04.340 --> 1:55:05.980
 like just a figment of my imagination.

1:55:05.980 --> 1:55:06.940
 There's actually a mechanism,

1:55:06.940 --> 1:55:09.100
 published mechanism to explain it.

1:55:09.100 --> 1:55:11.620
 But the most exciting thing to me about all this

1:55:11.620 --> 1:55:15.080
 is that practices that traditionally have been shrouded

1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:17.480
 in complicated language or were the unique domain

1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:21.180
 of the practitioners and relied on phrases

1:55:21.180 --> 1:55:23.840
 like the meridians or the chakras,

1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:25.820
 of which I think is perfectly valid language,

1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:27.300
 but doesn't inform mechanism.

1:55:27.300 --> 1:55:29.980
 And then in a separate community,

1:55:29.980 --> 1:55:32.380
 the community I come from, the community of scientists,

1:55:32.380 --> 1:55:35.900
 have used language like our two neurons,

1:55:35.900 --> 1:55:38.300
 medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis,

1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:40.740
 and basically no one can communicate with one another

1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:41.940
 because the language is shrouding.

1:55:41.940 --> 1:55:44.540
 What we're now starting to see is that

1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:48.120
 at their convergence is a common mechanism.

1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:49.640
 And with that understanding,

1:55:49.640 --> 1:55:52.420
 what's going to be really terrific

1:55:52.420 --> 1:55:55.060
 is as new protocols start to emerge.

1:55:55.060 --> 1:55:57.340
 So in understanding mechanisms and pathways

1:55:57.340 --> 1:56:01.340
 and in being able to understand the base set of practices,

1:56:01.340 --> 1:56:04.120
 like breathing, like electroacupuncture and so forth,

1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:07.980
 we can now start to daydream in a very realistic way

1:56:07.980 --> 1:56:10.300
 about the development of new protocols,

1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:11.660
 more effective protocols,

1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:14.780
 protocols that perhaps one can do at home without needles,

1:56:14.780 --> 1:56:17.240
 perhaps protocols such as the breathing

1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:18.820
 that you can do anywhere, anytime,

1:56:18.820 --> 1:56:21.560
 and be confident that you're actually impacting

1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:23.620
 the IL-6 and the IL-8 pathways,

1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:25.780
 reducing those and increasing IL-10.

1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:29.160
 So we are no longer wandering around in the fog,

1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:31.140
 hearing about these magical techniques

1:56:31.140 --> 1:56:32.540
 without understanding why they work,

1:56:32.540 --> 1:56:34.900
 nor are we just seeing a bunch of science

1:56:34.900 --> 1:56:38.020
 that is descriptive but not mechanistic

1:56:38.020 --> 1:56:39.700
 or pointing to specific protocols.

1:56:39.700 --> 1:56:41.340
 So I'm just delighted.

1:56:41.340 --> 1:56:42.800
 Again, I had nothing to do with this work,

1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:47.800
 but really terrific work, Chufu and colleagues.

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:50.220
 And I also want to acknowledge a journal

1:56:50.220 --> 1:56:53.580
 as prominent as nature for featuring this upfront

1:56:53.580 --> 1:56:55.580
 because I think it really does mark the beginning

1:56:55.580 --> 1:56:58.920
 of a new path in medicine.

1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:02.220
 And just to underscore that point a little bit further,

1:57:02.220 --> 1:57:03.860
 the National Institutes of Health, of course,

1:57:03.860 --> 1:57:05.780
 has a cancer institute, an eye institute

1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:07.460
 that deal with trying to combat cancer

1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:10.420
 and to cure blindness and so forth.

1:57:10.420 --> 1:57:12.820
 And now they have what's called NCCIH,

1:57:12.820 --> 1:57:14.580
 which is complementary health.

1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:18.060
 And so there are good tax dollars being put

1:57:18.060 --> 1:57:20.140
 to the kinds of explorations that we're talking about

1:57:20.140 --> 1:57:23.260
 that undoubtedly are going to lead to better treatments

1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:26.500
 for immunological diseases, neurological diseases,

1:57:26.500 --> 1:57:29.020
 the convergence of the immune system and the nervous system,

1:57:29.020 --> 1:57:30.460
 very exciting times.

1:57:30.460 --> 1:57:32.660
 And I hope that by learning about some of this new

1:57:32.660 --> 1:57:35.780
 and emerging science and hearing about some of the protocols

1:57:35.780 --> 1:57:38.740
 that are either zero cost or low cost,

1:57:38.740 --> 1:57:41.220
 certainly for respiration, that's the case,

1:57:41.220 --> 1:57:43.100
 or for the use of heat or cold

1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:45.020
 or maybe even electroacupuncture,

1:57:45.020 --> 1:57:46.380
 if you have access to that,

1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:50.060
 that we can really see that we're starting to evolve

1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:52.260
 as a field of health and medicine and science

1:57:52.260 --> 1:57:53.260
 and ancient practices,

1:57:53.260 --> 1:57:54.920
 and that they're really starting to converge

1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:56.380
 and have a vector, as we say,

1:57:56.380 --> 1:57:59.140
 in a new and more exciting direction.

1:57:59.140 --> 1:58:01.220
 Once again, we've covered a lot of information.

1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:02.780
 Today, we learned about the immune system,

1:58:02.780 --> 1:58:05.340
 the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system,

1:58:05.340 --> 1:58:07.660
 and the nervous system and how those interact.

1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:10.700
 And throughout, we discuss protocols that can allow you

1:58:10.700 --> 1:58:12.480
 to tap into this relationship

1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:14.620
 between the nervous system and immune system

1:58:14.620 --> 1:58:18.240
 and hopefully avoid and or shorten the course

1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:21.220
 of any illnesses, injuries, or inflammation

1:58:21.220 --> 1:58:22.960
 that you might encounter.

1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:26.660

 And we have a Patreon.

1:58:58.100 --> 1:59:00.540
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:59:00.540 --> 1:59:02.440
 And there you can support the podcast

1:59:02.440 --> 1:59:04.500
 at any level that you like.

1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:06.000
 A few times during this episode

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.160
 and in many previous episodes, I mentioned supplements.

1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:10.780
 Not everybody needs to take supplements,

1:59:10.780 --> 1:59:13.000
 but many people find benefit from them.

1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:14.800
 A key thing if you're going to take supplements

1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:16.780
 is to know that the quality of the supplements

1:59:16.780 --> 1:59:19.220
 that you're taking is very high.

1:59:19.220 --> 1:59:21.500
 And that's not always the case with many supplement brands.

1:59:21.500 --> 1:59:23.020
 That's why we partnered with Thorne.

1:59:23.020 --> 1:59:25.340
 That's T-H-O-R-N-E.

1:59:25.340 --> 1:59:26.640
 Thorne supplements are known to be

1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:27.960
 of the very highest quality

1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:31.660
 and the specificity of the ingredients is very high as well,

1:59:31.660 --> 1:59:32.820
 meaning what they list on the bottle

1:59:32.820 --> 1:59:34.860
 is actually what's contained in that bottle.

1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:36.060
 They've worked with the Mayo Clinic,

1:59:36.060 --> 1:59:37.200
 all the major sports teams.

1:59:37.200 --> 1:59:40.480
 So trust is very, very high with Thorne products.

1:59:40.480 --> 1:59:42.020
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:59:42.020 --> 1:59:47.020
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:59:47.020 --> 1:59:49.240
 And there you can see all the supplements that I take.

1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:51.540
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements.

1:59:51.540 --> 1:59:53.780

1:59:53.780 --> 1:59:56.980
 you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

1:59:56.980 --> 2:00:01.980
 That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash the letter U slash Huberman

2:00:03.420 --> 2:00:04.940
 to see the supplements that I take

2:00:04.940 --> 2:00:08.100
 or get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

 There I teach neuroscience and health-related topics

2:00:15.020 --> 2:00:16.840
 sometimes, but not always overlapping

2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:19.340
 with the content of the podcast.

2:00:19.340 --> 2:00:22.380
 We are also Huberman Lab on Twitter.

2:00:22.380 --> 2:00:24.580
 And last but not least,

2:00:24.580 --> 2:00:26.340
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:00:26.340 --> 2:00:27.340
 I'll see you next time.

2:00:27.340 --> 2:00:56.340
 I'll see you next time.
