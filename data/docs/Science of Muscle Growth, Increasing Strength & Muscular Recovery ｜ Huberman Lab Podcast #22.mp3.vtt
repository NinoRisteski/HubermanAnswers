00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.140
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.140 --> 00:15.300
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.060
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.060 --> 00:18.860
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:18.860 --> 00:21.000
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.000 --> 00:23.060
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.060 --> 00:25.180
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.180 --> 00:26.780
 to the general public.

00:26.780 --> 00:27.960
 In keeping with that theme,

00:27.960 --> 00:30.880
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.640
 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.180
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:36.180 --> 00:38.640
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:38.640 --> 00:40.220
 to help you better understand your body

00:40.220 --> 00:42.160
 and reach your health goals.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.840
 I've long been a fan of getting blood work done

00:44.840 --> 00:47.440
 for the simple reason that many of the things

00:47.440 --> 00:49.820
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

00:49.820 --> 00:52.840
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.800
 And now, with the advent of modern DNA tests,

00:55.800 --> 00:59.320
 we can also get insight into things like metabolic factors

00:59.320 --> 01:02.420
 that tell us whether or not we metabolize caffeine well

01:02.420 --> 01:04.320
 or certain proteins well,

01:04.320 --> 01:07.640
 what our fat metabolism genes are like.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.540
 Things of that sort can only be analyzed

01:09.540 --> 01:12.240
 from quality blood and DNA tests.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.500
 In addition, many of the factors that impact our hormones,

01:15.500 --> 01:17.760
 our metabolism, our brain health,

01:17.760 --> 01:20.240
 those come back in a blood and DNA test,

01:20.240 --> 01:22.220
 and there are many blood and DNA tests out there,

01:22.220 --> 01:23.800
 but with InsideTracker,

01:23.800 --> 01:26.320
 they give you a lot of clear insight

01:26.320 --> 01:29.500
 into what those markers mean and how to adjust them.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.280
 They have this terrific platform

01:31.280 --> 01:33.240
 that doesn't just give you the numbers back

01:33.240 --> 01:35.520
 and tell you if you're high or low in some factor,

01:35.520 --> 01:38.040
 but rather it tells you what your levels are

01:38.040 --> 01:39.080
 of all those factors

01:39.080 --> 01:42.080
 and gives you very simple and clear directives

01:42.080 --> 01:44.360
 of changes you might make in your diet,

01:44.360 --> 01:47.740
 changes that you might make in your exercise regimen

01:47.740 --> 01:48.980
 or sleep, et cetera,

01:48.980 --> 01:51.640
 in order to get those markers where they ought to be

01:51.640 --> 01:52.920
 and where you would like them to be

01:52.920 --> 01:55.180
 in order to optimize yourself.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.320
 So they make everything very easy, start to finish.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.300
 They can even come to your home

01:58.300 --> 02:00.760
 to take the blood and DNA tests if you like.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.320
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

02:02.320 --> 02:05.440
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

02:05.440 --> 02:06.460

02:12.020 --> 02:13.760
 Today's podcast is also brought to us

02:13.760 --> 02:15.920
 by Belcampo Meat Company.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.480
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

02:18.480 --> 02:20.100
 that raises organic grass-fed

02:20.100 --> 02:23.040
 and finished certified humane meats.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.440
 While I don't eat a lot of meat,

02:24.440 --> 02:28.300
 when I do, I insist that that meat be of very high quality.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.840
 How the animals were cared for is extremely important to me

02:31.840 --> 02:33.200
 and the life that the animal had

02:33.200 --> 02:36.300
 and what it consumed is very important to me.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.280
 So the way that I eat,

02:37.280 --> 02:38.880
 I've discussed on this podcast before,

02:38.880 --> 02:41.400
 but very briefly, I basically fast until about noon.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.600
 Then I eat a piece of beef or chicken

02:43.600 --> 02:45.620
 with lunch and a salad.

02:45.620 --> 02:46.620
 So that's basically my lunch.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.760
 That's what optimizes my levels of alertness

02:48.760 --> 02:50.400
 for work throughout the day.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.360
 Then in the evening,

02:51.360 --> 02:54.060
 I shift over to eating primarily carbohydrates.

02:54.060 --> 02:56.480
 That's what allows me to sleep very well.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.720
 So I'm not eating huge volumes of meat,

02:58.720 --> 03:01.520
 but I am eating meat every day.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.820
 Conventionally raised animals are confined to feed lots

03:03.820 --> 03:05.600
 and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

03:05.600 --> 03:06.540
 which is bad for them,

03:06.540 --> 03:09.140
 and it's bad for us when we eat their meat.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.320
 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

03:11.320 --> 03:12.300
 and seasonal grasses,

03:12.300 --> 03:14.140
 resulting in meat that is higher in nutrients

03:14.140 --> 03:15.040
 and healthy fats.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.240
 And I've talked before

03:16.240 --> 03:18.420
 about the importance of omega-3 fatty acids

03:18.420 --> 03:20.360
 for both brain and body health.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.880
 And Belcampo meats are high in omega-3 fatty acids.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.940
 The way Belcampo raises its animals

03:25.940 --> 03:27.120
 isn't just better for your health.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.660
 It also has a positive impact on the environment.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.040
 It's what's called climate positive and carbon negative,

03:32.040 --> 03:35.440
 which means good for the planet and good for us.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.000
 My favorite meats from Belcampo

03:37.000 --> 03:39.160
 are the ribeye and the flank steaks.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.320
 That's typically what I eat.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.120
 I think I probably eat about three or four of those

03:43.120 --> 03:43.940
 across the week,

03:43.940 --> 03:46.140
 and then I'll eat chicken on some other days.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.100
 They're really delicious.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.540
 And as I mentioned, they're very good for us.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.840
 You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats

03:51.840 --> 03:53.080
 to be delivered straight to your door

03:53.080 --> 03:57.840
 using my code Huberman at belcampo.com slash Huberman.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.400
 If you do that, you'll get 20% off first time order.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.720
 That's belcampo.com slash Huberman

04:03.720 --> 04:06.120
 for 20% off your first order.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.240
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

04:09.240 --> 04:13.100
 Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies

04:13.100 --> 04:16.780
 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

04:16.780 --> 04:18.760
 So I've been meditating on and off

04:18.760 --> 04:23.360
 since I was about 15, 16 years old, mostly off at first.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.040
 What I've found is that

04:25.040 --> 04:26.960
 I'll sometimes start a meditation practice,

04:26.960 --> 04:28.800
 but it's very hard to stay with.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.400
 And then a few years ago, I discovered Headspace

04:31.400 --> 04:33.160
 and I started meditating more regularly.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.960
 In fact, very recently,

04:34.960 --> 04:38.040
 because I've had an exorbitant amount of work on my plate

04:38.040 --> 04:40.540
 and I've been getting less sleep than I would like

04:40.540 --> 04:41.740
 in order to complete that work,

04:41.740 --> 04:45.440
 I've brought back a regular meditation practice twice a day,

04:45.440 --> 04:47.400
 not just my usual once a day.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.000
 Headspace makes it really easy.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.120
 They have so many meditations on there

04:51.120 --> 04:52.920
 and they guide you into the meditation

04:52.920 --> 04:54.600
 and out of the meditation in a way

04:54.600 --> 04:56.580
 that just makes it very simple

04:56.580 --> 04:59.920
 and makes maintaining the practice really straightforward.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.640
 Right now, if you want to try Headspace,

05:01.640 --> 05:04.760
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.860
 And if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial.

05:07.860 --> 05:09.200
 So that's totally free

05:09.200 --> 05:12.160
 with their full library of meditations for every situation.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.840
 So there's no meditations

05:13.840 --> 05:15.720
 that you can't get access to with this offer.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.680
 You can get access to everything they've got.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.680
 You just go to headspace.com slash special offer.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.320
 You get a free one month trial

05:22.320 --> 05:23.920
 and hopefully you'll decide to stay with it.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.760
 I've found that staying with meditation

05:25.760 --> 05:29.120
 has been immensely beneficial for all aspects of my life.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.200
 Today's episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast

05:31.200 --> 05:33.500
 is our fourth and final episode in this month,

05:33.500 --> 05:37.720
 which is all about skills and athletic performance.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.360
 Now, in a previous episode,

05:39.360 --> 05:41.320
 we talked about science-based,

05:41.320 --> 05:43.680
 in particular neuroscience-based tools

05:43.680 --> 05:46.220
 for accelerating fat loss.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.060
 Previous to that,

05:47.060 --> 05:49.920
 we talked about ways to improve skill learning,

05:49.920 --> 05:53.120
 motor movements, which also included things like music

05:53.120 --> 05:56.720
 and piano playing, not just athletic performance.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.240
 And we've also been exploring other aspects

05:59.240 --> 06:02.120
 of physical performance throughout the entire month.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.880
 Today, I want to talk about something

06:03.880 --> 06:05.720
 that is vitally important

06:05.720 --> 06:07.840
 for not just athletic performance,

06:07.840 --> 06:11.600
 but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.440
 and that's muscle.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.240
 Now, many of you, when you hear the word muscle,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.960
 think muscle growth and building big muscles.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.280
 And while we will touch on muscle hypertrophy,

06:20.280 --> 06:21.760
 muscle growth today,

06:21.760 --> 06:26.080
 and science-based protocols to enhance hypertrophy,

06:26.080 --> 06:28.400
 we will mainly be talking about muscle

06:28.400 --> 06:30.800
 as it relates to the nervous system.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.440
 And I can't emphasize this enough.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.480
 The whole reason why you have a brain

06:36.480 --> 06:38.200
 is so that you can move.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.680
 And one of the things that's exquisite and fantastic

06:41.680 --> 06:44.240
 about the human brain is that it can direct

06:44.240 --> 06:46.840
 all sorts of different kinds of movement,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.760
 different speeds of movement,

06:48.760 --> 06:50.800
 movement of different durations.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.080
 We can train our musculature

06:53.080 --> 06:55.120
 to lift heavier and heavier objects,

06:55.120 --> 06:56.800
 or we can train our musculature

06:56.800 --> 06:59.720
 to take us further and further, so-called endurance.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.700
 We can also build smoothness of movement, excuse me,

07:03.700 --> 07:05.600
 smoothness of movement,

07:05.600 --> 07:09.960
 as well as speed of movement, suppleness of movement.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.760
 All of that is governed by the relationship

07:13.760 --> 07:16.400
 between the nervous system, neurons,

07:16.400 --> 07:19.040
 and their connections to muscle.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.120
 So when you hear the science of muscle

07:21.120 --> 07:22.840
 and muscle hypertrophy,

07:22.840 --> 07:23.800
 you might think, oh, well,

07:23.800 --> 07:25.720
 I'm not interested in building muscle,

07:25.720 --> 07:28.600
 but muscle does many critical things.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.560
 It's important for movement.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.800
 It's important for metabolism.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.160
 The more muscle you have, and not just muscle size,

07:36.160 --> 07:39.480
 but the quality of muscle, that's a real thing,

07:39.480 --> 07:41.740
 the higher your metabolism is,

07:41.740 --> 07:44.120
 and indeed the healthier you are.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.860
 It turns out that jumping ability

07:47.860 --> 07:49.680
 and ability to stand up quickly

07:49.680 --> 07:51.500
 and to get up off the floor quickly

07:51.500 --> 07:54.540
 is one of the most predictive markers of aging

07:54.540 --> 07:56.960
 and biological aging, and no surprise,

07:56.960 --> 08:00.720
 that is governed by the brain-to-muscle connection.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.280
 In addition, muscle and musculature is vital for posture,

08:05.280 --> 08:08.260
 and we don't talk about posture enough.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.180
 We all have been told we need to sit up straight

08:10.180 --> 08:11.880
 or stand up straight,

08:11.880 --> 08:14.860
 but posture is vitally important

08:14.860 --> 08:17.520
 for how the rest of our body works.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.260
 It's vital to how we breathe.

08:19.260 --> 08:23.440
 It's actually even vital to how alert or sleepy we are.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.440
 So we're going to talk about the musculature for posture.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.360
 We also are going to talk about muscle

08:28.360 --> 08:30.640
 as it relates to aesthetic things.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.080
 Now, these are all linked.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.120
 Muscle for metabolism, movement, posture, and aesthetics,

08:35.120 --> 08:36.540
 of course, are linked, right?

08:36.540 --> 08:38.880
 As our posture changes, our aesthetic changes.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.520
 As our posture and aesthetic changes, how we move changes,

08:42.520 --> 08:45.600
 and as we improve muscle quality,

08:45.600 --> 08:48.680
 whether or not that's increasing muscle size or not,

08:48.680 --> 08:51.280
 that changes the way that our entire system,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.960
 not just our nervous system and our muscular system,

08:53.960 --> 08:57.640
 but our immune system and the other organs of the body work.

08:57.640 --> 08:58.940
 So today, as always,

08:58.940 --> 09:01.360
 we're going to talk a little bit of mechanism.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.920
 I'm going to explain how neurons control muscle,

09:04.920 --> 09:08.120
 and then we're going to look at muscle metabolism,

09:08.120 --> 09:09.760
 how muscle uses energy.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.700
 I promise to make all of this very simple.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.040
 I'm actually going to keep it very brief,

09:14.040 --> 09:16.000
 probably about 10 minutes total.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.380
 And by the end of that 10 minutes,

09:17.380 --> 09:19.000
 you will understand a lot

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
 about the neuromuscular connection,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.540
 how your brain and nervous system control your muscle

09:23.540 --> 09:25.700
 and how those muscles work.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.680
 Then we are going to talk about how muscles use energy

09:29.680 --> 09:32.200
 and can change how they use energy

09:32.200 --> 09:34.360
 for sake of getting stronger.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.800
 If you like, for also increasing the size,

09:36.800 --> 09:38.860
 so-called hypertrophy of muscle,

09:38.860 --> 09:40.760
 and for improving endurance,

09:40.760 --> 09:45.760
 as well as for improving posture and how you move generally.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.440
 We will touch on some nutritional themes

09:48.440 --> 09:49.560
 and how that relates to muscle,

09:49.560 --> 09:52.000
 in particular, a specific amino acid

09:52.000 --> 09:55.400
 that if it's available in your bloodstream frequently enough

09:55.400 --> 09:58.720
 and at sufficient levels can help you build

09:58.720 --> 10:01.760
 and improve the quality of muscle.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.600
 And we'll talk about specific exercise regimes

10:04.600 --> 10:07.580
 as well as, of course, supplementation

10:07.580 --> 10:09.680
 and things that can enhance

10:09.680 --> 10:12.280
 neuromuscular performance overall.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.920
 We are also going to talk about recovery.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.800
 Recovery, as everybody knows, is when things improve.

10:18.800 --> 10:23.320
 That's when neurons get better at controlling muscle.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.640
 That's when muscle grows.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.040
 That's when muscle gets more flexible.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.160
 None of that actually happens during training.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.840
 It happens after training.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.480
 And there is a lot of confusion

10:32.480 --> 10:34.220
 about how to optimize recovery

10:34.220 --> 10:37.240
 and how to measure whether or not you are recovered

10:37.240 --> 10:38.880
 and ready to come back in

10:38.880 --> 10:41.680
 for another neuromuscular training session.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.760
 So we'll talk about that as well.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.360
 Today is going to have a lot of protocols

10:46.360 --> 10:48.320
 and you're going to come away with a lot of understanding

10:48.320 --> 10:49.920
 about how you move, how you work,

10:49.920 --> 10:52.120
 and these incredible organs

10:52.120 --> 10:55.860
 that we call the nervous system and the musculature,

10:55.860 --> 10:58.520
 the so-called neuromuscular system.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.760
 Before we dive into today's topic,

11:00.760 --> 11:03.280
 I want to just take about three minutes

11:03.280 --> 11:07.740
 and cover some essential summary of the previous episode.

11:07.740 --> 11:10.800
 In the previous episode, we talked about fat loss,

11:10.800 --> 11:12.600
 talked about shiver-induced fat loss.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.080
 We talked about neat non-exercise activity thermogenesis

11:16.080 --> 11:19.780
 for increasing caloric burn and fat oxidation.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.200
 And we talked about how to use cold

11:22.200 --> 11:25.120
 specifically to enhance fat loss.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.360
 I described a protocol involving

11:27.360 --> 11:29.320
 getting into cold of some sort,

11:29.320 --> 11:31.920
 whether or not it's ice bath, cold shower,

11:31.920 --> 11:34.480
 some form of cold, it could even be a river or an ocean

11:34.480 --> 11:35.960
 if you have access to that,

11:35.960 --> 11:38.800
 and inducing shiver and then getting out,

11:38.800 --> 11:41.120
 not crossing your arms or huddling,

11:41.120 --> 11:43.320
 but allowing that cold to evaporate off you

11:43.320 --> 11:44.360
 and continuing to shiver

11:44.360 --> 11:47.280
 and then getting back into the colder environment of water

11:47.280 --> 11:49.000
 or stream or shower, et cetera.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.600
 All of that is described

11:51.600 --> 11:54.180
 in a beautifully illustrated protocol

11:54.180 --> 11:55.840
 that I didn't illustrate,

11:55.840 --> 11:57.520
 that's why it's beautifully illustrated,

11:57.520 --> 11:59.440
 at thecoldplunge.com.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.100
 They've made that protocol for you

12:02.100 --> 12:05.040
 and they've made it available free of charge for you.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.720
 So there's no obligation there of any kind financially,

12:07.720 --> 12:09.980
 you can go to thecoldplunge.com.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.760
 There's a little tab that says protocols

12:11.760 --> 12:13.240
 and you can download that protocol.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.960
 Someone there, I don't know who exactly illustrated it,

12:15.960 --> 12:17.520
 and you can come away with a PDF

12:17.520 --> 12:19.280
 of what I described in the previous episode.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.220
 So I just wanted to make sure

12:20.220 --> 12:22.520
 that you're aware of that resource.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.080
 The other announcement I'd like to make

12:24.080 --> 12:25.820
 is that many of you have asked

12:25.820 --> 12:27.500
 how you can help support the podcast

12:27.500 --> 12:29.460
 and there's a very straightforward,

12:29.460 --> 12:31.000
 zero cost way to do that

12:31.000 --> 12:33.560
 and that's to subscribe to our YouTube channel.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.200
 So if you go to YouTube,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.400
 if you're not already there watching this now,

12:37.400 --> 12:39.040
 hit the subscribe button,

12:39.040 --> 12:40.360
 that helps us tremendously

12:40.360 --> 12:43.420
 to get the word out more broadly about the podcast

12:43.420 --> 12:45.500
 and we thank you for your support.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.660
 Most people, when they hear the word muscle,

12:47.660 --> 12:49.440
 they just think about strength,

12:49.440 --> 12:53.080
 but of course muscles are involved in everything that we do.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.260
 They are involved in speaking,

12:54.260 --> 12:56.280
 they're involved in sitting and standing up,

12:56.280 --> 13:00.140
 they're involved in lifting objects, including ourselves.

13:00.140 --> 13:05.140
 They are absolutely essential for maintaining how we breathe,

13:05.240 --> 13:08.960
 they're absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving,

13:08.960 --> 13:11.900
 and for skills of any kind.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.180
 So when we think about muscle,

13:14.180 --> 13:16.400
 we don't just want to think about muscle,

13:16.400 --> 13:18.160
 the meat that is muscle,

13:18.160 --> 13:20.240
 but what controls that muscle.

13:20.240 --> 13:25.000
 And no surprise, what controls muscle is the nervous system.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.520
 The nervous system does that

13:26.520 --> 13:29.840
 through three main nodes of control, areas of control,

13:29.840 --> 13:32.140
 and I've talked about these before on a previous podcast,

13:32.140 --> 13:33.900
 so I will keep this very brief.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.240
 Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our motor cortex,

13:38.240 --> 13:40.280
 so those are in our skull,

13:40.280 --> 13:42.260
 and those are involved in deliberate movement.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.440
 So if I decide that I'm going to pick my pen up

13:44.440 --> 13:46.520
 and put it down, which is what I'm doing right now,

13:46.520 --> 13:48.200
 my upper motor neurons were involved

13:48.200 --> 13:49.920
 in generating that movement.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.960
 Those upper motor neurons send signals

13:51.960 --> 13:53.320
 down to my spinal cord,

13:53.320 --> 13:56.040
 where there are two categories of neurons.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.840
 One are the lower motor neurons,

13:58.840 --> 14:01.880
 and those lower motor neurons send little wires

14:01.880 --> 14:04.640
 that we call axons out to our muscles

14:04.640 --> 14:06.360
 and cause those muscles to contract.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.620
 They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle.

14:08.620 --> 14:12.100
 In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.220
 I've talked before about acetylcholine in the brain,

14:15.220 --> 14:17.620
 which is vitally important for focus

14:17.620 --> 14:19.940
 and actually can gate neuroplasticity,

14:19.940 --> 14:23.160
 the brain's ability to change in response to experience.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.480
 But in the neuromuscular system,

14:25.480 --> 14:27.960
 acetylcholine released from motor neurons

14:27.960 --> 14:32.960
 is the only way that muscles can contract.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.280
 Now, there's another category of neurons in the spinal cord

14:36.280 --> 14:38.960
 called central pattern generators or CPGs,

14:38.960 --> 14:41.940
 and those are involved in rhythmic movements.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.980
 Anytime we're walking or doing something

14:43.980 --> 14:45.520
 where we don't have to think about it

14:45.520 --> 14:48.840
 to do it deliberately, it's just happening reflexively,

14:48.840 --> 14:51.320
 that central pattern generators and motor neurons.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.480
 Anytime we're doing something deliberately,

14:53.480 --> 14:56.040
 the top-down control, as we call it,

14:56.040 --> 14:57.960
 from the upper motor neurons comes in

14:57.960 --> 15:00.040
 and takes control of that system.

15:00.040 --> 15:00.880
 So it's really simple.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.120
 You've only got three ingredients.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.220
 You've got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor neurons,

15:04.220 --> 15:06.320
 and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive,

15:06.320 --> 15:08.800
 you've also got the central pattern generators.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.880
 So it's a terrifically simple system at that level.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.320
 But what we're going to focus on today

15:15.320 --> 15:17.960
 is how that system can control muscle

15:17.960 --> 15:20.960
 in ways that make that system better.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.240
 Now, when I say better, I want to be very specific.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.800
 If your goal is to build larger muscles,

15:27.800 --> 15:30.200
 there's a way to use your nervous system

15:30.200 --> 15:32.600
 to trigger hypertrophy,

15:32.600 --> 15:35.100
 to increase the size of those muscles,

15:35.100 --> 15:38.320
 and it is indeed controlled by the nervous system.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.120
 So you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory

15:41.120 --> 15:43.820
 or that muscles grow in response to something

15:43.820 --> 15:45.760
 that's just happening within the muscle.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.500
 It's the nerve-to-muscle connection

15:47.500 --> 15:50.080
 that actually creates hypertrophy.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.240
 I'll talk exactly about how to optimize that process.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.580
 In addition, if you want to improve endurance

15:55.580 --> 15:59.440
 or improve flexibility or suppleness or explosiveness,

15:59.440 --> 16:02.320
 that is all accomplished by the way

16:02.320 --> 16:05.700
 that the nervous system engages muscles specifically.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.400
 And so what that means is we have to ask ourselves,

16:08.400 --> 16:10.940
 are we going to take control of the upper motor neurons,

16:10.940 --> 16:12.520
 the central pattern generators,

16:12.520 --> 16:15.480
 or the lower motor neurons, or all three

16:15.480 --> 16:17.680
 in order to get to some end point

16:17.680 --> 16:20.160
 of how the nervous system controls muscle.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.320
 So neurophysiology 101.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.840
 I'll give you one piece of history

16:24.840 --> 16:27.040
 because it's important to know.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.000
 Sherrington, who won the Nobel Prize,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.280
 called movement the final common path.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.880
 Why did he say that?

16:34.880 --> 16:38.040
 Well, the whole reason for having a nervous system,

16:38.040 --> 16:39.480
 the whole reason for having a brain

16:39.480 --> 16:42.000
 is so that we can control our movements

16:42.000 --> 16:43.680
 in very dedicated ways.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.160
 That is one of the reasons,

16:45.160 --> 16:48.800
 perhaps the predominant reason why the human brain

16:48.800 --> 16:50.280
 is so large.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.020
 You might think, oh, it's so large for thinking

16:52.020 --> 16:53.300
 and for creativity.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.140
 Ah, no.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.440
 When you look at the amount of real estate in the brain

16:56.440 --> 16:59.400
 that's devoted to different aspects of life,

16:59.400 --> 17:04.400
 it's mainly vision, our ability to see, and movement,

17:04.500 --> 17:07.140
 our ability to engage in lots of different kinds

17:07.140 --> 17:09.160
 of movements, slow movements, fast movements,

17:09.160 --> 17:10.680
 explosive, et cetera.

17:10.680 --> 17:14.800
 Other animals don't have that ability

17:14.800 --> 17:17.760
 because they don't have the mental real estate.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.840
 They don't have the neural real estate in their brain.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.420
 They have neuromuscular junctions.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.720
 They have central pattern generators.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.700
 What they don't have are these incredible upper motor neurons

17:26.700 --> 17:28.560
 that can direct activity of the muscles

17:28.560 --> 17:30.100
 in very specific ways.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.680
 So we can all feel blessed that we have this system.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.620
 And today I'm going to teach you how to use that system

17:35.620 --> 17:37.680
 toward particular end points.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.040
 So if we decide that we are going to direct our muscles

17:40.040 --> 17:42.660
 in some particular movement of any kind,

17:42.660 --> 17:44.760
 whether or not it's a weightlifting exercise

17:44.760 --> 17:46.400
 or whether it's a yoga movement,

17:46.400 --> 17:49.520
 or simply picking up and putting down a pen,

17:49.520 --> 17:52.100
 we are engaging flexors and extensors.

17:52.100 --> 17:55.600
 And our body is covered with flexors and extensors all over.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.720
 So for instance, our bicep is a flexor

17:57.720 --> 17:59.080
 and our tricep is an extensor.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.920
 Those are what are called antagonistic muscles.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.440
 They move the limbs in opposite directions.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.520
 So if you bring your wrist closer to your shoulder,

18:06.520 --> 18:08.640
 that's flexion using your bicep.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.120
 If you move your wrist further away from your shoulder,

18:11.120 --> 18:13.600
 that's extension using your tricep.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.840
 And without getting into a lot of detail,

18:15.840 --> 18:19.180
 the way that the nerves and brain are wired up to muscle,

18:19.180 --> 18:22.920
 make it such that when a flexor is activated,

18:22.920 --> 18:26.600
 when the nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto the muscle

18:26.600 --> 18:31.200
 to activate the biceps, the triceps is inhibited.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.720
 It's prevented from engaging.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.960
 There are ways to bypass this,

18:35.960 --> 18:37.820
 but that's the typical mode of action.

18:39.420 --> 18:40.840
 The converse is also true.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.080
 When our tricep is inactivated,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.400
 when we move our wrist away from our shoulder,

18:46.400 --> 18:48.240
 our bicep is inhibited.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.080
 And we have flexors like our abdominal muscles

18:51.080 --> 18:54.040
 and we have extensors in our lower back.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.460
 Many of you probably know this,

18:55.460 --> 18:56.640
 but some of you probably don't,

18:56.640 --> 19:00.160
 that your spine has flexors to move basically your chin

19:00.160 --> 19:01.080
 toward your waist.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.840
 And those are your abdominal muscles among others.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.660
 And you have extensors that move your chin basically back,

19:08.660 --> 19:09.940
 like looking up toward the ceiling,

19:09.940 --> 19:11.440
 and those are your extensors.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.840
 You have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles

19:13.840 --> 19:14.680
 and things of that sort,

19:14.680 --> 19:17.020
 but those movements of flexion and extension

19:17.020 --> 19:19.520
 and the fact that they are what we call

19:19.520 --> 19:22.100
 reciprocally innervated or mutual inhibition,

19:22.100 --> 19:23.740
 you hear different language around this,

19:23.740 --> 19:28.740
 is characteristic of most of our limb movements, okay?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.580
 So hamstring and quadricep,

19:30.580 --> 19:33.640
 the hamstring brings the ankle closer back

19:33.640 --> 19:35.000
 towards the glutes.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.660
 Basically it's lifting your heel up, right?

19:38.660 --> 19:40.800
 Which is almost always done toward the back.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.540
 Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor,

19:43.540 --> 19:44.800
 opposite to the hamstrings.

19:44.800 --> 19:45.700
 So you get the idea.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.120
 So there's flexors and extensors,

19:47.120 --> 19:51.220
 and it's the neurons that control those flexors and extensors

19:51.220 --> 19:53.620
 that allow us to move in particular ways.

19:53.620 --> 19:57.200
 So now you have heard neuromuscular physiology

19:57.200 --> 19:59.960
 in its simplest form, but I do want this to be accessible.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.100
 I want to get just briefly,

20:02.100 --> 20:05.160
 just briefly into some of the underlying metabolism

20:05.160 --> 20:08.620
 of how muscles use and create energy

20:08.620 --> 20:09.700
 because in doing that,

20:09.700 --> 20:11.620
 we will be in a great position to understand

20:11.620 --> 20:13.100
 all the tools that follow

20:13.100 --> 20:15.340
 about how to optimize the neuromuscular system

20:15.340 --> 20:16.820
 for your particular goals.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.860
 So in the previous episode about fat loss,

20:18.860 --> 20:20.340
 we talked about lipolysis,

20:20.340 --> 20:22.900
 the breakdown of fat into fatty acids

20:22.900 --> 20:24.860
 so it can be used as fuel.

20:24.860 --> 20:27.840
 And it ended in a step where we got ATP,

20:27.840 --> 20:30.940
 which is the bottleneck and final common path

20:30.940 --> 20:34.960
 for all energy producing functions in the body.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.960
 There are other ways,

20:35.960 --> 20:39.520
 but basically ATP is the key element there.

20:39.520 --> 20:43.780
 Now with muscles, they don't function on fats normally.

20:43.780 --> 20:46.780
 What they are going to function on their ability to move

20:46.780 --> 20:48.460
 and their ability to do things

20:48.460 --> 20:51.420
 and allow us to move in any way that we want to

20:51.420 --> 20:53.880
 is based on a process of glycolysis,

20:53.880 --> 20:57.140
 the breakdown of things like glycogen

20:57.140 --> 20:59.440
 and glucose into energy.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.580
 And it's a very simple process.

21:01.580 --> 21:03.000
 You don't have to know any chemistry.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.020
 So if I say the words carbon or hydrogen

21:05.020 --> 21:05.840
 or something like that,

21:05.840 --> 21:06.680
 you don't have to freak out.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.060
 You don't have to understand any chemistry.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.360
 But basically what happens

21:10.360 --> 21:14.500
 is you've got this available sugar resource

21:14.500 --> 21:17.060
 that's stored in muscle, okay?

21:17.060 --> 21:18.940
 And that's glucose.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.780
 And that glucose has six carbons

21:21.780 --> 21:24.780
 and six waters basically.

21:25.620 --> 21:30.620
 That can be broken down into two sets of three carbons.

21:31.740 --> 21:32.580
 All right?

21:32.580 --> 21:33.560
 So basically you take glucose

21:33.560 --> 21:37.100
 and you break it into these two little batches of carbons

21:37.100 --> 21:38.380
 that we call pyruvates.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.900
 So six divided by two is three.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.660
 So you get three and three pyruvates.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.540
 And that generates a little bit of ATP of energy,

21:44.540 --> 21:46.420
 but just a little bit.

21:46.420 --> 21:49.580
 Now, if there's oxygen available, okay?

21:49.580 --> 21:52.380
 If there's sufficient oxygen there,

21:52.380 --> 21:55.260
 what can happen is that pyruvate

21:55.260 --> 21:57.740
 can be brought to the mitochondria

21:57.740 --> 21:59.180
 and through a whole set of things

21:59.180 --> 22:01.340
 that you probably don't want to hear about right now,

22:01.340 --> 22:05.140
 like the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle.

22:05.140 --> 22:07.760
 What happens is it's broken down

22:07.760 --> 22:12.060
 and you get 28 to 30 ATP, which is a lot of ATP.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.780
 So the only things you need to know,

22:13.780 --> 22:15.540
 the only things you need to know about this process

22:15.540 --> 22:19.420
 is that glucose and glycogen are broken down into pyruvate.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.340
 You get a little bit of energy from that.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.720
 And when I say energy, I mean the ability to move.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.560
 It's fuel.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.460
 It literally just gets burned up.

22:26.460 --> 22:29.900
 But if there's oxygen available, and that's key,

22:29.900 --> 22:34.040
 then within the mitochondria, you can create 28 to 30 ATP,

22:34.040 --> 22:35.980
 which is a lot of ATP.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.020
 Now, what does this mean?

22:37.020 --> 22:40.020
 This means that movement of muscle

22:40.020 --> 22:41.740
 is metabolically expensive.

22:41.740 --> 22:43.780
 And indeed, compared to other tissues,

22:43.780 --> 22:46.140
 compared to fat, compared to bone,

22:46.140 --> 22:49.540
 compared to almost all other tissues except brain tissue,

22:49.540 --> 22:52.440
 muscle is the most metabolically demanding,

22:52.440 --> 22:54.920
 which is why people who have more muscle

22:54.920 --> 22:57.900
 relative to adipose tissue to fat,

22:57.900 --> 22:59.980
 they can eat more and they're more of a furnace.

22:59.980 --> 23:02.820
 They just kind of burn that up, okay?

23:02.820 --> 23:05.780
 So even if you didn't understand anything that I just said,

23:05.780 --> 23:08.820
 what you probably did hear and that I hope you heard

23:08.820 --> 23:10.980
 is that if you have oxygen around,

23:10.980 --> 23:13.200
 you can create energy from this fuel source

23:13.200 --> 23:16.220
 that we call glycogen and glucose.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.940
 But what if there isn't oxygen around?

23:18.940 --> 23:20.260
 And what is that like?

23:20.260 --> 23:22.520
 Well, you've experienced that.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.380
 I'm not talking about oxygen in the environment.

23:24.380 --> 23:26.180
 I'm talking about oxygen in the muscle.

23:26.180 --> 23:29.060
 So if you've ever carried a box while moving,

23:29.060 --> 23:32.260
 or you were carrying heavy groceries to the car,

23:32.260 --> 23:34.380
 or you were exercising particularly hard

23:34.380 --> 23:36.220
 and you felt the burn,

23:36.220 --> 23:40.580
 well, that burning, which most people think is lactic acid,

23:40.580 --> 23:44.900
 is actually a process by which pyruvate,

23:44.900 --> 23:45.940
 which as I said before,

23:45.940 --> 23:48.620
 normally could be converted into ATP if there's oxygen.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.340
 Well, if there's not enough oxygen

23:50.340 --> 23:53.220
 because that muscle is working too hard or too long,

23:53.220 --> 23:56.260
 what ends up happening is that a hydrogen molecule

23:56.260 --> 23:59.100
 comes in there and you get something called lactate.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.540
 So believe it or not, humans don't make lactic acid.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.620
 That's another species.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.500
 We make lactate and we think,

24:05.500 --> 24:07.620
 and we hear that lactate is bad.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.940
 We need to buffer the burn or avoid the burn,

24:10.940 --> 24:14.180
 that lactic acid and lactate are what prevent us

24:14.180 --> 24:17.600
 for performing as well as we ought to be able to,

24:17.600 --> 24:20.340
 or for going as far as we possibly could

24:20.340 --> 24:21.980
 in an endurance event.

24:21.980 --> 24:24.180
 Guess what, that's not true at all.

24:24.180 --> 24:25.940
 Lactate has three functions,

24:25.940 --> 24:28.500
 all of which are really interesting and really important.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.760
 First of all, it's a buffer against acidity.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.600
 You don't want muscle to get too acidic

24:34.600 --> 24:35.640
 because it can't function.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.880
 You don't want any body tissue to get too acidic.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.740
 So that burn that you feel is acidity in that environment,

24:41.740 --> 24:45.320
 that, and lactate, what most people call lactic acid,

24:45.320 --> 24:46.780
 but again, we don't make lactic acid,

24:46.780 --> 24:49.040
 lactate is there to buffer that,

24:49.040 --> 24:51.920
 to reduce the amount of burn.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.700
 So most people have this exactly backwards.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.580
 So when you feel that burn, that is not lactic acid,

24:57.580 --> 25:02.080
 that is lactate that's present to suppress the burn,

25:02.080 --> 25:03.620
 to suppress acidity.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.480
 It's also a fuel.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.140
 When you feel that burn,

25:08.140 --> 25:11.500
 lactate is shuttled to those areas of the muscle,

25:11.500 --> 25:14.340
 and there's an actual fuel burning process

25:14.340 --> 25:16.120
 where in the absence of oxygen,

25:16.120 --> 25:18.980
 you can continue to generate muscular contractions.

25:18.980 --> 25:19.980
 Now, this is informative

25:19.980 --> 25:21.920
 because it also tells us that that burning,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.200
 that acidity that we feel

25:24.200 --> 25:27.400
 can inhibit the way that our muscles work,

25:27.400 --> 25:28.680
 but that lactate comes in

25:28.680 --> 25:31.760
 and allows our muscles to continue to function.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.100
 So we'll talk a little bit more

25:33.100 --> 25:36.520
 about what this whole lactate thing and the burn means,

25:36.520 --> 25:38.000
 but it's a really important process,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.880
 and it's amazing to me that most people understand it

25:40.880 --> 25:42.840
 in exactly the incorrect way.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.440
 They think, oh, lactic acid is bad and the burn is bad.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.960
 No, it reveals a number of really important things

25:47.960 --> 25:50.720
 are going on with this vital molecule lactate,

25:50.720 --> 25:53.640
 which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn,

25:53.640 --> 25:55.960
 as well as act as a fuel.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.200
 Now, here's where it gets really, really cool,

25:58.200 --> 26:01.800
 and if you don't have enough of an incentive to exercise

26:01.800 --> 26:03.320
 based on all the information out there

26:03.320 --> 26:05.080
 about how it'll make you live longer

26:05.080 --> 26:07.200
 and make your heart better, et cetera,

26:07.200 --> 26:10.760
 here's a reason that regardless

26:10.760 --> 26:12.180
 of what kind of exercise you do,

26:12.180 --> 26:15.800
 if it's weight training or running or cycling or swimming,

26:15.800 --> 26:19.920
 that every once in a while, about 10% of the time,

26:19.920 --> 26:22.840
 you should exercise to the point of intensity

26:22.840 --> 26:26.840
 where you start to feel that so-called burn, right?

26:26.840 --> 26:29.600
 The reason for that is that lactate

26:29.600 --> 26:34.540
 shows up to the site of the burn, so to speak,

26:34.540 --> 26:36.760
 and it acts as a hormonal signal

26:36.760 --> 26:41.200
 for other organs of the body in a very positive way, okay?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.880
 As you may recall from a very early episode

26:43.880 --> 26:45.040
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

26:45.040 --> 26:47.680
 I talked about what a hormone is and how it works.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.800
 We have lots of different kinds of hormones,

26:49.800 --> 26:51.900
 but hormones are chemicals that are released

26:51.900 --> 26:53.980
 in one location in the body and travel,

26:53.980 --> 26:57.540
 have effects on lots of other organs of the body.

26:57.540 --> 27:02.240
 So when I say that lactate acts as a hormonal signal,

27:03.720 --> 27:06.480
 what I mean is that it's in a position to influence tissues

27:06.480 --> 27:09.640
 that are outside of the muscle,

27:09.640 --> 27:14.240
 and basically it can send signals to the heart,

27:14.240 --> 27:16.720
 to the liver, and to the brain,

27:16.720 --> 27:18.360
 and it can have effects on the heart,

27:18.360 --> 27:21.640
 the liver, and the brain that are very positive, okay?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.180
 So just to zoom out for a second,

27:23.180 --> 27:25.400
 I promise we won't get any more technical than this.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.200
 We will get into tools and protocols

27:27.200 --> 27:28.820
 that are really straightforward,

27:28.820 --> 27:33.460
 but what I'm telling you is that if you feel a burn

27:33.460 --> 27:35.760
 from a particular exercise or movement,

27:37.740 --> 27:40.240
 that burn is going to be buffered

27:40.240 --> 27:42.800
 by this molecule we call lactate.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.860
 Lactate will then provide additional fuel

27:44.860 --> 27:45.960
 for additional work.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.720
 So this is a good incentive provided you can do it safely

27:48.720 --> 27:51.000
 to quote unquote work through the burn.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
 That burn acts as a beacon to the lactate,

27:56.600 --> 27:58.480
 which comes in and allows you to do more work.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.800
 It's not a signal to stop necessarily.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.540
 I mean, stop if you're doing something unsafe,

28:02.540 --> 28:05.480
 but it's a signal that lactate should come in

28:05.480 --> 28:07.760
 and allow you to continue to do work,

28:07.760 --> 28:10.880
 and it can act as a hormonal signal.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.160
 Lactate can then travel to the heart

28:14.160 --> 28:16.040
 and to the liver and to the brain

28:16.040 --> 28:18.440
 and can enhance their function in positive ways,

28:18.440 --> 28:19.720
 not just in those moments,

28:19.720 --> 28:22.760
 but in the period of time that follows.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.920
 So many people are curious about how they can exercise

28:25.920 --> 28:27.280
 to make their brain better.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.800
 That's one of the most common questions I get.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.600
 What I'm telling you is that provided you can do it safely

28:34.320 --> 28:36.480
 by engaging the so-called burn,

28:36.480 --> 28:39.040
 which is a different threshold for everybody, right?

28:39.040 --> 28:41.620
 Your hill run will be different than my hill run

28:41.620 --> 28:43.000
 to generate the burn,

28:43.000 --> 28:47.160
 but provided you can do that for about 10% of your workouts

28:47.160 --> 28:52.160
 or of an individual workout or activity of any kind,

28:52.160 --> 28:54.160
 you are generating the activity

28:54.160 --> 28:56.700
 of this lactate-based hormonal signal

28:56.700 --> 29:00.360
 that can improve the function of neurons.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.720
 And it does that, if you want to know for the aficionados,

29:02.720 --> 29:04.600
 by improving the function of another cell type

29:04.600 --> 29:07.520
 called the astrocytes, which are a glial cell type, okay,

29:07.520 --> 29:09.440
 which are very involved in clearance of debris

29:09.440 --> 29:10.360
 from the brain.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.560
 They're involved in the formation of synapses,

29:12.560 --> 29:14.440
 connections between neurons in the brain.

29:14.440 --> 29:18.360
 So put simply, if you're an exerciser,

29:18.360 --> 29:19.960
 if you're doing movement of any kind,

29:19.960 --> 29:23.040
 and you're interested in allocating some of that movement

29:23.040 --> 29:27.020
 toward enhancing brain, heart, and liver health,

29:27.020 --> 29:30.720
 there is a nice set of scientific data

29:30.720 --> 29:32.960
 that points to the fact that getting lactate

29:32.960 --> 29:37.600
 shuttled to the muscles by engaging this burning sensation

29:37.600 --> 29:40.920
 is advantageous for the health of those other tissues.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.140
 So as I mentioned, that burn is present

29:43.140 --> 29:45.960
 from lack of oxygen being present,

29:45.960 --> 29:49.160
 and then the hydrogen comes in and you get this lactate.

29:49.160 --> 29:53.440
 But this process of lactate acting as a buffer of fuel

29:53.440 --> 29:55.960
 and a positive hormonal signal for other tissues

29:56.860 --> 29:59.080
 occurs only if there's oxygen.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.520
 So if you feel the burn,

30:01.520 --> 30:05.280
 you definitely want to focus on your breathing at that point

30:05.280 --> 30:07.920
 that would be the time to take deep inhales

30:07.920 --> 30:10.620
 and try and bring more oxygen into your system.

30:10.620 --> 30:12.480
 It's definitely not a time to hold your breath.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.040
 And if ever you've run to the point of feeling the burn

30:15.040 --> 30:17.840
 and then you were exercising in any way on the treadmill

30:17.840 --> 30:19.920
 or on the bike or whatever, and felt that burn,

30:19.920 --> 30:22.780
 and then you held your breath, it feels much more intense.

30:22.780 --> 30:26.840
 By breathing, you bring lactate to the site

30:26.840 --> 30:30.200
 and you are able to allow lactate to act more

30:30.200 --> 30:33.880
 as a buffer of fuel and a hormonal signal.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.520
 And the reason I brought this up today is because,

30:36.520 --> 30:38.220
 as I mentioned, so many people are interested

30:38.220 --> 30:40.840
 in using exercise, not just for sake of improving

30:40.840 --> 30:43.900
 physical health and wellbeing and performance,

30:43.900 --> 30:46.320
 but also for enhancing their brain.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.680
 And there are a lot of data out there

30:48.680 --> 30:53.680
 speaking to the findings that exercise of various kinds

30:53.680 --> 30:57.600
 can increase neurogenesis, the creation of new neurons.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.900
 Well, the unfortunate news is that while that's true in mice,

31:01.900 --> 31:05.640
 there is very little evidence for enhanced neurogenesis

31:05.640 --> 31:08.040
 from exercise or otherwise in humans.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.740
 There's a little bit, and there are a few sites

31:09.740 --> 31:11.540
 within the brain, such as the dentate gyrus

31:11.540 --> 31:13.840
 of the hippocampus, which may be involved

31:13.840 --> 31:15.640
 in the formation of new memories.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.860
 To be clear, the dentate gyrus is definitely involved

31:17.860 --> 31:19.160
 in the formation of new memories.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.320
 Whether or not the new neurons that are added there

31:21.320 --> 31:24.680
 in humans are involved in new memories is,

31:24.680 --> 31:27.920
 the evidence for that is weak at best, frankly,

31:27.920 --> 31:30.660
 whereas in animals, the data are quite strong.

31:30.660 --> 31:32.920
 But most of the data point to the fact

31:32.920 --> 31:36.480
 that hormonal signals, things that are transported

31:36.480 --> 31:38.480
 in the blood during exercise,

31:38.480 --> 31:42.120
 are what are beneficial for the brain, excuse me,

31:42.120 --> 31:46.200
 and that those signals are not causing the increase

31:46.200 --> 31:49.520
 in the number of neurons in the dentate gyrus or otherwise,

31:49.520 --> 31:51.440
 that it's more about the health of the connections

31:51.440 --> 31:53.980
 between the neurons, growth factors of various kinds,

31:53.980 --> 31:56.840
 things like IGF-1, there's a long list of these things.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.140
 So if you've heard that exercise increases the number

31:59.140 --> 32:01.680
 of neurons in your brain, well, that's not true.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.560
 And that probably is a good thing, frankly,

32:03.560 --> 32:05.580
 because we always hear more neurons,

32:05.580 --> 32:07.320
 more neurons as if it's a good thing,

32:07.320 --> 32:09.800
 but the brain doesn't do so well

32:09.800 --> 32:12.240
 with bringing in entirely new elements.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.600
 It has a hard time negotiating that

32:14.600 --> 32:16.080
 and making use of those new elements.

32:16.080 --> 32:19.320
 We know about this from things like the cochlear implant,

32:19.320 --> 32:20.920
 where deaf people are given a device

32:20.920 --> 32:22.340
 where they suddenly can hear.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.560
 Some people really like that.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.680
 Deaf people really like that and can benefit from it.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.600
 Other deaf people find that it's very intrusive,

32:29.600 --> 32:33.900
 that it's hard to take an existing neural circuit

32:33.900 --> 32:35.840
 in the brain and incorporate a lot

32:35.840 --> 32:37.100
 of new information into it.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.000
 So new neurons, as great as that sounds,

32:39.000 --> 32:40.440
 more neurons, more neurons,

32:40.440 --> 32:42.600
 it actually might not be the best way

32:42.600 --> 32:44.900
 for the nervous system to change and modify itself

32:44.900 --> 32:46.480
 and to promote its own longevity.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.260
 So when I tell you not such great evidence

32:50.260 --> 32:52.480
 for new neurons past puberty,

32:52.480 --> 32:55.400
 that's what the data really show in humans.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.320
 And I sort of knock back the data

32:57.320 --> 32:59.320
 on exercise and neurogenesis.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.600
 Don't let that depress you.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.920
 If you have dementia in your family,

33:01.920 --> 33:06.680
 don't translate that into necessarily

33:06.680 --> 33:08.360
 that you will develop dementia.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.800
 Understand that exercise is still beneficial

33:10.800 --> 33:13.480
 for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system,

33:13.480 --> 33:14.680
 but that it's going to be doing it

33:14.680 --> 33:16.400
 through these hormonal signals,

33:16.400 --> 33:20.560
 things like IGF-1, things like this lactate pathway

33:20.560 --> 33:22.560
 when you experience the burn from exercise.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.680
 And again, you don't want to try

33:23.680 --> 33:25.400
 and get this feeling of a burn

33:25.400 --> 33:28.600
 throughout the entire episode of exercise.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.360
 That'll be far too intense and would inhibit your recovery.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.200
 I don't think it'd be good for performance either.

33:33.200 --> 33:36.340
 It's only about 10% of your total effort

33:36.340 --> 33:38.120
 in any one exercise bout

33:38.120 --> 33:40.060
 that's going to give you this positive effect.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.000
 So now you know how to devote a small portion

33:42.000 --> 33:44.080
 of your exercise, 10%,

33:44.080 --> 33:48.600
 in order for muscle and lactate to benefit other tissues,

33:48.600 --> 33:51.660
 namely your heart, your liver, and your brain.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.160
 I'd now like to shift our attention

33:53.160 --> 33:57.320
 to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction

33:57.320 --> 34:00.400
 to improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth,

34:00.400 --> 34:03.240
 as well as improving muscle strength.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.480
 There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.300
 And I should just mention that it's not always the case

34:09.300 --> 34:12.240
 that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger.

34:12.240 --> 34:14.280
 There are ways for muscles to get stronger

34:14.280 --> 34:15.440
 without getting bigger.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.200
 However, increasing the size of a muscle

34:19.200 --> 34:22.360
 almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle,

34:22.360 --> 34:24.140
 at least to some degree.

34:24.140 --> 34:26.160
 Reasons why most everyone

34:26.160 --> 34:28.240
 should want to get their muscles stronger

34:28.240 --> 34:32.020
 is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker

34:32.020 --> 34:33.620
 across the lifespan.

34:33.620 --> 34:34.860
 So when I say getting stronger,

34:34.860 --> 34:37.860
 it's not necessarily about being able to move

34:37.860 --> 34:40.560
 increasing amounts of weight in the gym.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.920
 Although if that's your goal,

34:41.920 --> 34:44.920
 what I'm about to discuss will be relevant to that.

34:44.920 --> 34:49.080
 But rather to offset some of the normal decline

34:49.080 --> 34:52.720
 in strength and posture and the ability to generate

34:52.720 --> 34:56.520
 a large range of movement safely that occurs as we age.

34:56.520 --> 34:57.880
 As I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

34:57.880 --> 35:01.400
 we just tend to lose function in this neuromuscular system

35:01.400 --> 35:02.520
 as we get older.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.860
 And doing things to offset that

35:04.860 --> 35:07.520
 has been shown again and again to be beneficial

35:07.520 --> 35:11.420
 for the neuromuscular system, for protection of injury,

35:11.420 --> 35:14.800
 for enhancing the strength of bones and bone density.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.960
 So there are a lot of reasons to use resistance exercise

35:17.960 --> 35:19.520
 that extend far beyond

35:19.520 --> 35:22.320
 just the desire to increase muscle size.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.400
 Because I know many of you

35:23.400 --> 35:25.720
 are interested in increasing muscle size,

35:25.720 --> 35:27.820
 but many of you are not.

35:27.820 --> 35:30.440
 So there's an important principle of muscle physiology

35:30.440 --> 35:32.760
 called the Henneman size principle.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.040
 And the Henneman size principle essentially says that

35:36.040 --> 35:40.060
 we recruit what are called motor units.

35:40.060 --> 35:41.800
 Motor units are just the connections

35:41.800 --> 35:46.800
 between nerve and muscle in a pattern that staircases

35:47.360 --> 35:50.240
 from low threshold to high threshold.

35:50.240 --> 35:54.840
 What this means is when you pick up something that is light,

35:54.840 --> 35:56.720
 you're going to use the minimum amount

35:56.720 --> 36:00.060
 of nerve to muscle energy in order to move that thing.

36:00.060 --> 36:03.740
 Likewise, when you pick up an object that's heavy,

36:03.740 --> 36:05.520
 you're going to use the minimum amount

36:05.520 --> 36:08.240
 of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy

36:08.240 --> 36:10.780
 in order to move that object.

36:10.780 --> 36:14.800
 So it's basically a conservation of energy principle.

36:14.800 --> 36:19.400
 Now, if you continue to exert effort of movement,

36:19.400 --> 36:21.720
 what will happen is you will tend to recruit

36:21.720 --> 36:24.840
 more and more motor units with time.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.620
 And that process of recruiting more neurons,

36:27.620 --> 36:29.720
 more lower motor neurons,

36:29.720 --> 36:31.440
 as if you recall from the beginning of the episode,

36:31.440 --> 36:33.220
 these lower motor neurons are in our spinal cord

36:33.220 --> 36:36.720
 and they actually dump a chemical, acetylcholine on muscle,

36:36.720 --> 36:38.480
 cause the muscles to contract.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.840
 As you recruit more and more of these motor units,

36:41.840 --> 36:43.940
 these connections between these lower motor neurons

36:43.940 --> 36:47.580
 and muscle, that's when you start to get changes

36:47.580 --> 36:48.720
 in the muscle.

36:48.720 --> 36:52.000
 That's when you open the gate for the potential

36:52.000 --> 36:54.820
 for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger,

36:54.820 --> 36:56.400
 if that's what your goal is.

36:56.400 --> 36:59.960
 And so the way this process works

36:59.960 --> 37:03.760
 has been badly misunderstood in the kind of online

37:03.760 --> 37:06.020
 literature of weight training and bodybuilding

37:06.020 --> 37:08.080
 and even in sports physiology.

37:08.080 --> 37:12.160
 The Henneman size principle is kind of a foundational

37:12.160 --> 37:14.440
 principle within muscle physiology,

37:14.440 --> 37:18.160
 but many people have come to interpret it by saying

37:18.160 --> 37:21.700
 that the way to recruit high threshold motor units,

37:21.700 --> 37:23.240
 the ones that are hard to get to,

37:23.240 --> 37:25.760
 is to just use heavy weights.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.960
 And that's actually not the case.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.240
 As we'll talk about, the research supports

37:30.240 --> 37:35.240
 that weights in a very large range of sort of a percentage

37:36.000 --> 37:40.180
 of your maximum, anywhere from 30 to 80%.

37:40.180 --> 37:42.480
 So weights that are not very light,

37:42.480 --> 37:46.960
 but are moderately light, too heavy can cause changes

37:46.960 --> 37:48.680
 in the connections between nerve and muscle

37:48.680 --> 37:52.480
 that lead to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy.

37:52.480 --> 37:57.280
 Put differently, heavy weights can help build muscle

37:57.280 --> 37:59.840
 and strength, but they are not required.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.560
 What one has to do is adhere to a certain number

38:02.560 --> 38:05.160
 of parameters, just a couple of key variables

38:05.160 --> 38:06.480
 that I'll spell out for you.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.900
 And if you do that, you can greatly increase

38:09.900 --> 38:13.900
 muscle hypertrophy, muscle size, and or muscle strength

38:13.900 --> 38:15.760
 if that's what you want to do.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.640
 And you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights

38:18.640 --> 38:19.720
 in order to do that.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.280
 Now I'm sure the power lifters and the people

38:22.280 --> 38:25.080
 that like to move heavy weights around will say,

38:25.080 --> 38:26.440
 no, if you want to get strong,

38:26.440 --> 38:28.580
 you absolutely have to lift heavy weights.

38:28.580 --> 38:31.580
 And that might be true if you want to get very strong,

38:31.580 --> 38:33.800
 but for most people who are interested

38:33.800 --> 38:36.120
 in supporting their muscular,

38:36.120 --> 38:39.920
 such that they offset any age-related decline in strength

38:39.920 --> 38:44.160
 or in increasing hypertrophy and strength to some degree,

38:44.160 --> 38:46.800
 there really isn't a need to lie

38:46.800 --> 38:48.360
 about the Henneman size principle,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.040
 which many people out there are doing,

38:50.040 --> 38:52.540
 and claiming that you absolutely need to use

38:52.540 --> 38:53.700
 the heaviest weights possible

38:53.700 --> 38:55.400
 in order to build strength and muscle.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.920
 So I'm going to explain how all of this works in simple terms.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.360
 So first of all, let's just talk about what hypertrophy is

39:02.360 --> 39:05.680
 and what strength changes in the muscle are.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.760
 We can make this very simple as well.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.520
 If this were a muscle physiology class,

39:09.520 --> 39:13.240
 we would talk all about myofibrils and sarcomeres

39:13.240 --> 39:14.080
 and all that stuff.

39:14.080 --> 39:14.900
 We're not going to do that.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.200
 That's not the purpose of today's conversation.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.620
 If you're interested in that,

39:18.620 --> 39:20.580
 as well as a lot of the other information

39:20.580 --> 39:23.480
 that I'm going to discuss in more detail,

39:23.480 --> 39:27.320
 I highly encourage you to check out the YouTube channel

39:27.320 --> 39:30.280
 and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.520
 He's a PhD and a full professor in exercise physiology.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.760
 He's extremely knowledgeable in this entire area

39:36.760 --> 39:39.560
 of science-based tools for hypertrophy,

39:39.560 --> 39:41.720
 how strength and hypertrophy really work.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.100
 His lab does everything from biopsy on muscles,

39:44.100 --> 39:46.840
 working with athletes and typical folks as well.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.780
 A lot of the information that you're going to hear from me

39:48.780 --> 39:50.380
 in the next 15 minutes or so

39:50.380 --> 39:53.920
 comes from an extensive exploration of the work

39:53.920 --> 39:55.600
 that he and his colleagues have done,

39:55.600 --> 39:57.840
 as well as folks like Brad Schoenfeld,

39:57.840 --> 39:59.520
 another academic who's superb

39:59.520 --> 40:01.560
 in this whole space of muscle physiology,

40:01.560 --> 40:05.280
 and from a lengthy conversation that I had with Andy,

40:05.280 --> 40:08.160
 Dr. Galpin, prior to this episode.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.620
 So if we want to think about muscle hypertrophy,

40:11.620 --> 40:13.400
 we have to ask what is changing

40:13.400 --> 40:15.220
 when muscles get larger or stronger?

40:15.220 --> 40:17.800
 And there are really just three ways

40:17.800 --> 40:20.480
 that muscles can be stimulated to change.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.820
 So let's review those three ways

40:21.820 --> 40:24.320
 and talk about what happens inside the muscle.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
 So there are three major stimuli

40:26.320 --> 40:29.400
 for changing the way that muscle works

40:29.400 --> 40:33.560
 and making muscles stronger, larger, or better in some way.

40:33.560 --> 40:37.880
 And those are stress, tension, and damage.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.360
 Those three things don't necessarily all have to be present,

40:42.360 --> 40:44.660
 but stress of some kind has to exist.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.520
 Something has to be different

40:46.520 --> 40:49.000
 in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle

40:49.000 --> 40:51.840
 and the way that the muscle contracts or performs

40:51.840 --> 40:54.960
 that makes the muscle need to change.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.040
 So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the brain.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.120
 Something needs to happen.

41:00.120 --> 41:01.760
 Certain chemicals need to be present.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.760
 Certain processes need to happen,

41:03.760 --> 41:06.560
 or else a tissue simply won't change itself.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.680
 But if those processes and events do happen,

41:09.680 --> 41:12.280
 then the tissue has essentially no option

41:12.280 --> 41:14.680
 except but to change.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.920
 So muscles move, as I mentioned,

41:17.920 --> 41:20.680
 because nerves dump chemical onto the muscles,

41:20.680 --> 41:24.520
 but they move because they have these things called myosin

41:24.520 --> 41:25.560
 and actin filaments.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.000
 And if you want to read up on this,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.320
 you can look on the internet.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.180
 You can put the sliding filament theory

41:31.180 --> 41:32.200
 of muscle contraction

41:32.200 --> 41:34.340
 if you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.300
 It's interesting.

41:35.300 --> 41:38.060
 You can learn about this in a muscle physiology class.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.560
 But basically, along the length of the muscle,

41:41.560 --> 41:43.200
 you have what's called myosin.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.680
 And just think of myosin as kind of like a wire.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.560
 It's like a bunch of beads and wires

41:49.560 --> 41:51.200
 that extend across the muscle.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.420
 I think that's the simplest way to describe it.

41:53.420 --> 41:55.060
 And the myosin is surrounded

41:55.060 --> 41:57.260
 by these little beads called actin.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.400
 The way muscles get bigger

42:00.400 --> 42:04.740
 is that basically the myosin gets thicker.

42:04.740 --> 42:06.160
 It's a protein, right?

42:06.160 --> 42:07.460
 And it gets thicker.

42:07.460 --> 42:09.360
 So put this in your mind.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.300
 If you're listening to this,

42:10.300 --> 42:12.280
 or even if you're watching it on YouTube,

42:12.280 --> 42:14.480
 the way to think about this whole actin-myosin thing

42:14.480 --> 42:15.480
 and muscles getting bigger

42:15.480 --> 42:18.920
 is imagine that you're holding a bouquet of balloons,

42:18.920 --> 42:21.080
 a bunch of balloons by their strings,

42:21.080 --> 42:23.700
 except you're not holding the strings all at their bottom.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.360
 So the bouquet isn't nicely arranged.

42:25.360 --> 42:28.040
 It's not like some balloons that are all up at the top

42:28.040 --> 42:30.480
 and you're holding the strings down at the bottom.

42:30.480 --> 42:32.480
 Imagine that one of the balloons

42:32.480 --> 42:33.640
 is very close to your hand.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.340
 Another one is a little bit higher up.

42:35.340 --> 42:37.300
 And so this bouquet is very disorganized.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.680
 In other words, the string extending out of your hand,

42:39.680 --> 42:41.560
 the strings, rather, extending out of your hand

42:41.560 --> 42:43.040
 are all different lengths.

42:43.040 --> 42:45.920
 And so the balloons are all over the place.

42:45.920 --> 42:49.280
 That's essentially what myosin looks like in the muscle.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.880
 And those strings are what we call the filaments.

42:51.880 --> 42:56.040
 And then the myosin head is the balloon.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.600
 When you stress a muscle properly,

42:58.600 --> 43:00.920
 or you give it sufficient tension,

43:00.920 --> 43:04.320
 or you damage the muscle just enough,

43:04.320 --> 43:06.600
 there's an adaptive response that takes place

43:06.600 --> 43:08.440
 where protein is synthesized,

43:08.440 --> 43:11.360
 and it's a very specific protein, it's myosin.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.920
 The myosin gets thicker.

43:12.920 --> 43:16.400
 In other words, the balloons get bigger.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.800
 So the way to think about muscle growth

43:18.800 --> 43:21.960
 and the way to think about muscles getting stronger

43:21.960 --> 43:24.560
 is that those balloons get bigger

43:24.560 --> 43:26.900
 and the muscle gets thicker.

43:26.900 --> 43:28.960
 Now, the question then should be,

43:28.960 --> 43:31.360
 as always, how does that happen?

43:31.360 --> 43:33.680
 I mean, the muscle doesn't really know anything

43:33.680 --> 43:36.320
 about what's happening in the outside world.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.540
 The way it happens is the nerve,

43:38.540 --> 43:42.160
 the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.280
 And it does that through what we call a signaling cascade.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.020
 It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals.

43:47.020 --> 43:49.600
 It doesn't whisper to it or shout, hey, get bigger.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.860
 What it does, it releases certain chemicals

43:51.860 --> 43:53.620
 that within the muscle,

43:53.620 --> 43:55.120
 there are certain chemicals released, rather,

43:55.120 --> 43:57.900
 that make those balloons, as I'm referring to them,

43:57.900 --> 43:59.520
 the myosin gets thicker.

43:59.520 --> 44:02.240
 So let's talk about the stimulus for doing that.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.720
 And if already in your mind you're imagining,

44:04.720 --> 44:06.500
 oh my goodness, these balloons of muscle

44:06.500 --> 44:07.920
 are going to get thick, thick, thick, thick, thick,

44:07.920 --> 44:10.720
 and it's just going to spiral out of control,

44:10.720 --> 44:11.680
 don't worry about that.

44:11.680 --> 44:13.600
 People invest a ton of time and energy

44:13.600 --> 44:15.680
 into trying to make their muscles larger.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.800
 It's actually much harder for people to do

44:17.800 --> 44:19.040
 than you might think.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.840
 But I do want to give one exception

44:20.840 --> 44:22.940
 because it illustrates an important principle

44:22.940 --> 44:24.900
 of where we're headed next.

44:24.900 --> 44:29.900
 Everybody has imbalances in how muscles can grow,

44:32.440 --> 44:35.200
 how well muscles can grow or how poorly

44:35.200 --> 44:37.820
 or how challenging it is for their muscles to grow.

44:37.820 --> 44:41.720
 Now, many people who are afraid of like getting too bulky,

44:41.720 --> 44:43.720
 for instance, are afraid of lifting weights.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.680
 But I think the research shows now

44:45.680 --> 44:48.040
 that everyone of pretty much every age

44:48.040 --> 44:50.140
 should be doing some sort of resistance exercise,

44:50.140 --> 44:52.480
 even if that's body weight exercises,

44:52.480 --> 44:55.560
 in order to offset this age-related decline

44:55.560 --> 44:58.960
 in muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera,

44:58.960 --> 45:00.560
 improved bone density.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.060
 There's nothing good about getting frail and weak over time.

45:05.060 --> 45:09.160
 And people who invest the effort into doing resistance

45:09.160 --> 45:11.880
 exercises of some kind, whether or not it's with bands

45:11.880 --> 45:13.880
 or with weights or with body weight,

45:13.880 --> 45:17.280
 really benefit tremendously at a whole body level,

45:17.280 --> 45:20.320
 at a systemic level, as well as in terms of muscle strength.

45:21.780 --> 45:25.460
 There is a good predictor of how well

45:25.460 --> 45:28.600
 or how efficient you will be in building the strength

45:28.600 --> 45:32.200
 and or if you like the size of a given muscle.

45:32.200 --> 45:34.820
 And it has everything to do with those upper motor neurons

45:34.820 --> 45:37.240
 that are involved in deliberate control of muscle.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.440
 You can actually do this test right now.

45:39.440 --> 45:42.640
 You can just kind of march across your body mentally

45:42.640 --> 45:46.400
 and see whether or not you can independently contract

45:46.400 --> 45:48.320
 any or all of your muscles.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.780
 So for instance, if you are sitting in a chair

45:50.780 --> 45:53.320
 or you're standing, see whether or not

45:53.320 --> 45:55.600
 you can contract your calf muscle

45:55.600 --> 45:57.560
 just using those upper motor neurons,

45:57.560 --> 45:59.460
 sending a signal down and deliberately

45:59.460 --> 46:01.740
 isolating the calf muscle, okay?

46:01.740 --> 46:05.060
 If you can contract the calf muscle hard

46:05.060 --> 46:07.440
 to the point where that muscle almost feels

46:07.440 --> 46:08.340
 like it's starting to cramp,

46:08.340 --> 46:10.840
 like it hurts just a little bit,

46:10.840 --> 46:12.240
 it's not going to be extremely painful

46:12.240 --> 46:15.640
 nor is it going to have no sensation whatsoever,

46:15.640 --> 46:18.640
 chances are you have very good upper motor neuron

46:18.640 --> 46:20.320
 to calf control.

46:20.320 --> 46:23.700
 And chances are, if you can isolate that,

46:23.700 --> 46:26.560
 what they call the brain or mind muscle connection,

46:26.560 --> 46:28.100
 and you can contract the muscle to the point

46:28.100 --> 46:29.800
 where it cramps a little bit,

46:29.800 --> 46:33.040
 that you hold a decent to high potential

46:33.040 --> 46:36.320
 to change the strength and the size of that muscle

46:36.320 --> 46:37.940
 if you train it properly.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.980
 Now, if you have a hard time doing that,

46:39.980 --> 46:43.300
 chances are you won't be able to do that.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.680
 If, for instance, you focus on your back muscle,

46:47.680 --> 46:50.140
 like we all have these muscles called the lat,

46:50.140 --> 46:51.440
 the latissimus dorsi muscles,

46:51.440 --> 46:53.460
 which basically are involved in chin ups

46:53.460 --> 46:55.060
 and things like that, but their function

46:55.060 --> 46:58.200
 from a more of a kinesiology standpoint

46:58.200 --> 47:01.520
 is to move the elbow back behind the body, okay?

47:01.520 --> 47:02.860
 So it's not about flexing your bicep,

47:02.860 --> 47:05.280
 it's about moving your elbow back behind your body.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.560
 If you can do that mentally,

47:08.560 --> 47:10.360
 or you can do that physical movement

47:10.360 --> 47:12.220
 of moving your elbow back behind your body

47:12.220 --> 47:14.120
 and you can contract that muscle hard,

47:14.120 --> 47:16.680
 chances are that you have the capacity

47:16.680 --> 47:19.560
 to enhance the strength and or size

47:19.560 --> 47:21.280
 of that particular muscle

47:21.280 --> 47:24.540
 because you have the neural control of that muscle.

47:24.540 --> 47:27.720
 This is a key feature of the neuromuscular system

47:27.720 --> 47:30.280
 to appreciate as we begin to talk more

47:30.280 --> 47:32.480
 about specific protocols

47:32.480 --> 47:36.160
 because everything about muscle hypertrophy,

47:36.160 --> 47:38.840
 about stimulating muscle growth

47:38.840 --> 47:42.240
 is about generating isolated contractions,

47:42.240 --> 47:47.240
 about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.600
 Whereas with strength,

47:49.600 --> 47:51.960
 it's about using musculature as a system,

47:51.960 --> 47:55.640
 moving weights, moving resistance, moving the body.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.800
 The specific goal of hypertrophy

47:58.800 --> 48:02.260
 is to isolate specific nerve to muscle pathways

48:02.260 --> 48:04.340
 so that you stimulate the chemical

48:04.340 --> 48:06.500
 and signaling transduction events in muscles

48:06.500 --> 48:09.340
 so that those muscles respond by getting larger.

48:09.340 --> 48:11.000
 So there's a critical distinction

48:11.000 --> 48:12.780
 in terms of getting stronger

48:12.780 --> 48:15.940
 versus trying to get muscles to be larger,

48:15.940 --> 48:17.820
 hypertrophy per se,

48:17.820 --> 48:21.340
 and it has to do with how much you isolate those muscles.

48:21.340 --> 48:24.460
 Muscle isolation is not a natural phenomenon.

48:24.460 --> 48:25.800
 It's not something that we normally do.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.140
 When we walk, we don't think,

48:27.140 --> 48:29.900
 okay, right calf contract, left calf contract.

48:29.900 --> 48:32.080
 No, you just generate those rhythmic movements.

48:32.080 --> 48:33.500
 And of course, there's no reason for them

48:33.500 --> 48:36.700
 to get stronger or larger in response to those movements.

48:36.700 --> 48:39.380
 Let's say you were to do a kind of strange experiment

48:39.380 --> 48:41.620
 of attaching 30 pound weights to your ankles

48:41.620 --> 48:43.620
 and you were to do those movements.

48:43.620 --> 48:46.900
 Well, if you weren't specifically contracting your calves

48:46.900 --> 48:49.260
 in each step, there's no reason for the calves

48:49.260 --> 48:51.460
 to take on the bulk of the work

48:51.460 --> 48:52.820
 and you would distribute that work

48:52.820 --> 48:54.800
 across your hip flexors and other aspects

48:54.800 --> 48:55.640
 of your musculature.

48:55.640 --> 48:58.500
 Your whole nervous system seeks to gain efficiency.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.180
 It seeks to spread out the effort.

49:01.180 --> 49:04.700
 So you can nest this as a principle for yourself,

49:04.700 --> 49:06.760
 which is if you want to get stronger,

49:06.760 --> 49:10.540
 it's really about moving progressively greater loads

49:10.540 --> 49:13.080
 or increasing the amount of weight that you move.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.220
 Whereas if you're specifically interested

49:15.220 --> 49:17.540
 in generating hypertrophy,

49:17.540 --> 49:20.780
 it's all about trying to generate those really hard,

49:20.780 --> 49:24.180
 almost painful localized contractions of muscle.

49:24.180 --> 49:25.780
 Now, of course, how much weight you use

49:25.780 --> 49:27.500
 in order to generate those contractions

49:27.500 --> 49:29.820
 will also impact hypertrophy.

49:29.820 --> 49:31.900
 But I think most people don't really understand

49:31.900 --> 49:33.100
 the mind muscle connection.

49:33.100 --> 49:34.620
 It sounds like a great thing,

49:34.620 --> 49:37.620
 but it's actually one of the things you want to avoid

49:37.620 --> 49:40.420
 if your goal is simply to become more supple

49:40.420 --> 49:42.820
 or to become stronger.

49:42.820 --> 49:45.900
 You want to do the movements properly and safely, of course,

49:45.900 --> 49:48.820
 but it's the opposite of hypertrophy

49:48.820 --> 49:50.860
 where with hypertrophy, you're really trying to make

49:50.860 --> 49:53.780
 that particular muscle, sometimes two muscles,

49:53.780 --> 49:56.580
 do the majority, if not all the work.

49:56.580 --> 49:58.360
 Whereas in moving force loads,

49:58.360 --> 50:02.060
 in trying to generate activity of any kind,

50:02.060 --> 50:04.500
 like lifting a bar or doing a chin up or something,

50:04.500 --> 50:06.020
 those so-called compound movements

50:06.020 --> 50:07.900
 that involve a lot of muscle groups,

50:07.900 --> 50:10.900
 if your goal is to be better at those,

50:10.900 --> 50:14.660
 you want to avoid isolating any one particular muscle.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.980
 Now, I know this probably comes across

50:15.980 --> 50:18.380
 as a kind of a obvious duh,

50:18.380 --> 50:21.020
 especially to the folks that have spent a lot of time

50:21.020 --> 50:24.180
 in the gym aimed at getting hypertrophy,

50:24.180 --> 50:25.720
 but I think most people don't appreciate

50:25.720 --> 50:27.700
 that it's the nerve to muscle connections

50:27.700 --> 50:30.180
 and the distinction between isolating nerve

50:30.180 --> 50:33.140
 to muscle connections versus distributing the work

50:33.140 --> 50:35.660
 of nerve to muscle connections that's vital

50:35.660 --> 50:38.180
 in determining whether or not you generate hypertrophy,

50:38.180 --> 50:40.280
 isolated nerve to muscle contractions,

50:40.280 --> 50:44.140
 versus strength and offsetting strength loss,

50:44.140 --> 50:47.400
 which would be distributed nerve to muscle connections.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.820
 If ever there was an area of practical science

50:49.820 --> 50:53.260
 that was very confused, very controversial,

50:53.260 --> 50:55.540
 and almost combative at times,

50:55.540 --> 50:58.240
 it would be this issue of how best to train.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.960
 I suppose the only thing that's even more barbed wire

51:00.960 --> 51:04.060
 of a conversation than that is how best to eat for health.

51:04.060 --> 51:09.060
 Those seem to be the two most common areas of online battle.

51:09.220 --> 51:12.020
 And the scientific literature has a lot to say

51:12.020 --> 51:13.700
 about both of those things.

51:13.700 --> 51:16.420
 Again, my sources for what I'm about to tell you

51:16.420 --> 51:19.540
 are Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues.

51:19.540 --> 51:20.940
 I know there are other excellent people

51:20.940 --> 51:23.580
 out there in the field, but I really trust his work.

51:23.580 --> 51:26.380
 He does very controlled studies.

51:26.380 --> 51:27.760
 He spent a lot of time in this space.

51:27.760 --> 51:29.500
 And what's really exciting is that

51:29.500 --> 51:32.380
 in just the last three years or so,

51:32.380 --> 51:34.300
 there's been a tremendous amount of information

51:34.300 --> 51:37.060
 to come out about the practical steps that one can take

51:37.060 --> 51:40.380
 in order to maximize the benefits

51:40.380 --> 51:43.300
 of resistance exercise of any kind.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.720
 So I'm going to talk about those

51:44.720 --> 51:46.300
 and I'm going to talk about the research.

51:46.300 --> 51:48.060
 I will provide some links,

51:48.060 --> 51:50.960
 both to a couple of the more in-depth tutorials

51:50.960 --> 51:54.160
 from Dr. Galpin, as well as some of the papers

51:54.160 --> 51:56.860
 that the information I'm about to tell you stems from.

51:59.060 --> 52:00.820
 There's a lot of information saying

52:00.820 --> 52:05.100
 that you need to move weights that are 80 to 90%

52:05.100 --> 52:07.100
 of your one rep maximum or 70%

52:07.100 --> 52:08.620
 or cycle that for three weeks on

52:08.620 --> 52:09.780
 and then go to more moderate weights.

52:09.780 --> 52:12.660
 There are a lot of paths, as some people say,

52:12.660 --> 52:16.180
 there are a lot of ways to add up numbers to get 100.

52:16.180 --> 52:17.740
 There's a near infinite number of ways

52:17.740 --> 52:20.220
 to add up different numbers to get to 100.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.280
 And what's very clear now

52:22.280 --> 52:24.700
 from all the literature that's transpired

52:24.700 --> 52:27.220
 and especially from the literature in this last three years

52:27.220 --> 52:32.220
 is that once you know roughly your one repetition maximum,

52:32.260 --> 52:34.540
 the maximum amount of weight

52:34.540 --> 52:37.820
 that you can perform an exercise with

52:37.820 --> 52:41.940
 for one repetition in good form, full range of motion,

52:41.940 --> 52:46.340
 that it's very clear that moving weights

52:46.340 --> 52:51.140
 or using bands or using body weight, for instance,

52:51.140 --> 52:54.740
 in the 30 to 80% of one rep maximum,

52:54.740 --> 52:57.420
 that is going to be the most beneficial range

52:57.420 --> 52:59.640
 in terms of muscle hypertrophy and strength,

52:59.640 --> 53:01.500
 so muscle growth and strength.

53:01.500 --> 53:02.880
 And there will be a bias.

53:02.880 --> 53:07.000
 If you're moving weights that are in the 75%, 80% range,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.780
 or maybe even going above that 85 and 90%,

53:09.780 --> 53:12.420
 you're going to bias your improvements

53:12.420 --> 53:14.980
 towards strength gains, this is true.

53:14.980 --> 53:16.300
 And if you use weights

53:16.300 --> 53:19.140
 that are in the 30% of your one repetition maximum

53:19.140 --> 53:23.340
 or 40% or 50% and doing many more repetitions, of course,

53:23.340 --> 53:25.720
 then you are biasing towards hypertrophy

53:25.720 --> 53:27.940
 and what some people like to call muscle endurance,

53:27.940 --> 53:29.960
 but that's a little bit of a complicated term

53:29.960 --> 53:32.360
 because endurance we almost always think of

53:32.360 --> 53:34.180
 as relating to running or swimming

53:34.180 --> 53:36.500
 or some long bouts of activity.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.440
 So 30 to 80% of one repetition maxims,

53:39.440 --> 53:43.340
 it doesn't really seem to matter for sake of hypertrophy,

53:43.340 --> 53:44.760
 except at the far ends

53:44.760 --> 53:47.340
 when you're really trying to bias for strength.

53:47.340 --> 53:50.300
 Now, it is clear, however,

53:50.300 --> 53:55.300
 that one needs to perform those sets to failure

53:55.660 --> 53:58.080
 where you can't perform another repetition

53:58.080 --> 54:01.740
 in good form again or near to failure.

54:01.740 --> 54:03.660
 And there's all sorts of interesting nomenclature

54:03.660 --> 54:05.440
 that's popping up all over the internet,

54:05.440 --> 54:06.580
 some of which is scientific,

54:06.580 --> 54:07.940
 some of which is not scientific

54:07.940 --> 54:10.660
 about how you are supposed to perceive

54:10.660 --> 54:13.020
 how close you were to failure, et cetera.

54:13.020 --> 54:15.920
 But there are some very interesting principles

54:15.920 --> 54:18.340
 that relate to how the nerves connect to the muscles

54:18.340 --> 54:20.740
 that strongly predict whether or not this exercise

54:20.740 --> 54:23.480
 that you're performing will be beneficial for you or not.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.900
 So here's how it goes.

54:24.900 --> 54:27.440
 For individuals that are untrained,

54:27.440 --> 54:30.240
 meaning they have been doing resistance exercise

54:31.360 --> 54:35.100
 for anywhere from zero, probably out to about two years,

54:35.100 --> 54:37.860
 although for some people it might be zero to one year,

54:37.860 --> 54:39.540
 but those are the so-called beginners.

54:39.540 --> 54:41.320
 They're sort of untrained.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.460
 For those people, the key parameter

54:43.460 --> 54:46.460
 seems to be to perform enough sets

54:46.460 --> 54:50.340
 of a given exercise per muscle per week, okay?

54:50.340 --> 54:52.640
 The same is also true for people that have been training

54:52.640 --> 54:54.620
 for one or two years or more.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.460
 What differs is how many sets to perform

54:58.340 --> 55:00.080
 depending on whether or not you're trained or untrained.

55:00.080 --> 55:00.920
 So let's say you're somebody

55:00.920 --> 55:03.540
 who's been doing some resistance exercise

55:03.540 --> 55:06.460
 kind of on and off over the years,

55:06.460 --> 55:08.200
 and you decide you want to get serious about that

55:08.200 --> 55:09.740
 for sake of sport or offsetting

55:09.740 --> 55:11.840
 age-related declines in strength.

55:12.900 --> 55:16.660
 The range of sets to do in order to improve strength,

55:16.660 --> 55:19.300
 to activate these cascades in the muscle

55:19.300 --> 55:21.980
 ranges anywhere from two, believe it or not,

55:21.980 --> 55:23.560
 to 20 per week.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.080
 Again, these are sets per week,

55:25.080 --> 55:27.500
 and they don't necessarily all have to be performed

55:27.500 --> 55:29.100
 in the same weight training session.

55:29.100 --> 55:31.220
 I will talk about numbers of sessions.

55:31.220 --> 55:35.660
 So it appears that five sets per week

55:35.660 --> 55:40.340
 in this 30% to 80% of the one repetition maximum range,

55:40.340 --> 55:42.980
 getting close to failure,

55:42.980 --> 55:46.820
 or occasionally actually going to full muscular failure,

55:46.820 --> 55:48.380
 which isn't really full muscular failure,

55:48.380 --> 55:51.860
 but the inability to generate a contraction of the muscle

55:51.860 --> 55:53.520
 or move the weight in good form,

55:53.520 --> 55:54.820
 I'll go deeper into that in a moment,

55:54.820 --> 55:57.140
 but about five sets per week is what's required

55:57.140 --> 55:58.940
 just to maintain your muscles.

55:58.940 --> 55:59.820
 So think about that.

55:59.820 --> 56:01.180
 If you're somebody who's kind of averse

56:01.180 --> 56:02.500
 to resistance training,

56:02.500 --> 56:05.340
 you are going to lose muscle size and strength,

56:05.340 --> 56:08.100
 your metabolism will drop, your posture will get worse,

56:08.100 --> 56:11.220
 everything in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity

56:11.220 --> 56:12.920
 will get worse over time,

56:13.820 --> 56:18.820
 unless you are generating five sets or more

56:19.180 --> 56:23.780
 of this 30% to 80% of your one repetition maximum per week.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.340
 Okay, so what this means is for the typical person

56:26.340 --> 56:27.760
 who hasn't done a lot of weight training,

56:27.760 --> 56:31.520
 you need to do at least five sets per muscle group.

56:31.520 --> 56:33.420
 Now that's just to maintain,

56:33.420 --> 56:35.820
 and then there's this huge range that goes all the way up

56:35.820 --> 56:38.660
 to 15 and in some case, 20 sets per week.

56:38.660 --> 56:41.820
 Now, how many sets you perform is going to depend

56:41.820 --> 56:45.100
 on the intensity of the work that you perform.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.180
 This is where it gets a little bit controversial,

56:47.180 --> 56:50.020
 but I think nowadays most people agree

56:50.020 --> 56:54.260
 and Dr. Galpin confirmed that 10%,

56:54.260 --> 56:57.060
 not to be confused with the 10% we discussed earlier,

56:57.060 --> 57:01.420
 but 10% of the sets of a given workout

57:01.420 --> 57:05.300
 or 10% of workouts overall

57:05.300 --> 57:07.520
 should be of the high intensity sort

57:07.520 --> 57:09.740
 where one is actually working to muscular failure.

57:09.740 --> 57:11.740
 Now I say not true muscular failure,

57:11.740 --> 57:14.460
 because in theory you have a concentric movement,

57:14.460 --> 57:15.940
 which is the kind of lifting of the weight,

57:15.940 --> 57:17.340
 and then you have the eccentric portion

57:17.340 --> 57:19.260
 of muscle contraction, which is the lowering.

57:19.260 --> 57:20.660
 And the eccentric movements,

57:20.660 --> 57:22.960
 because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen

57:22.960 --> 57:26.520
 and that sliding actin myosin that we talked about before,

57:26.520 --> 57:28.860
 you're always stronger in lowering something

57:28.860 --> 57:31.500
 than you are in lifting it.

57:31.500 --> 57:34.600
 But the point being that most of your training,

57:34.600 --> 57:38.740
 most of your sets should be not to failure.

57:38.740 --> 57:40.680
 And the reason for that is it allows you

57:40.680 --> 57:43.640
 to do more volume of work

57:43.640 --> 57:46.100
 without fatiguing the nervous system

57:46.100 --> 57:48.660
 and depleting the nerve to muscle connection

57:48.660 --> 57:50.660
 in ways that are detrimental.

57:50.660 --> 57:52.900
 So we can make this simple.

57:52.900 --> 57:56.060
 Perform anywhere from five to 15 sets

57:56.060 --> 58:01.060
 of resistance exercise per week, and that's per muscle,

58:01.460 --> 58:03.740
 and that's in this 30 to 80%

58:03.740 --> 58:05.500
 of what your one repetition maximum.

58:05.500 --> 58:08.780
 That seems to be the most scientifically supported way

58:08.780 --> 58:12.540
 of offsetting any decline in muscle strength

58:12.540 --> 58:14.520
 if you're working in the kind of five set range

58:14.520 --> 58:17.100
 and in increasing muscle strength

58:18.120 --> 58:21.360
 when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.380
 Now the caveat to that is everyone varies

58:24.380 --> 58:27.480
 and muscles vary in terms of their recoverability.

58:28.460 --> 58:30.660
 Depending on how well you can control

58:30.660 --> 58:33.620
 the contraction of muscles deliberately,

58:33.620 --> 58:35.960
 and you can actually figure that out by sort of marching.

58:35.960 --> 58:36.940
 You might take five minutes

58:36.940 --> 58:38.340
 and just kind of march across your body

58:38.340 --> 58:42.260
 and mentally try and control the contractions of muscles

58:42.260 --> 58:43.740
 in a very deliberate way to the point

58:43.740 --> 58:45.620
 where you can generate a hard contraction.

58:45.620 --> 58:46.740
 And you may have to move a limb

58:46.740 --> 58:47.820
 in order to do this by the way.

58:47.820 --> 58:50.740
 I'm not talking about just mentally contracting your bicep

58:50.740 --> 58:51.680
 without moving your wrist.

58:51.680 --> 58:54.620
 I'm talking about doing that without any weight in hand

58:54.620 --> 58:56.820
 or any band or any resistance.

58:56.820 --> 58:59.420
 If you can generate a high intensity contraction

58:59.420 --> 59:00.740
 using these upper motor neuron

59:00.740 --> 59:03.820
 to lower motor neuron pathways to muscle,

59:04.760 --> 59:09.300
 you might think, well, I should perform many more sets.

59:09.300 --> 59:11.460
 But actually the opposite is true.

59:12.400 --> 59:15.480
 If you can generate high intensity muscular contractions

59:15.480 --> 59:17.740
 using your brain, using your neurons,

59:17.740 --> 59:22.260
 it will take fewer sets in order to stimulate the muscle

59:22.260 --> 59:25.500
 to maintain itself and to stimulate the muscle

59:25.500 --> 59:28.160
 in order to grow or get stronger.

59:28.160 --> 59:32.220
 So the more efficient you are in recruiting motor units,

59:32.220 --> 59:34.000
 remember Henneman's size principle,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.140
 the recruitment of more motor units,

59:36.140 --> 59:39.140
 which isn't just muscles, it's nerve to muscle connections.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.940
 The better you are at doing that,

59:40.940 --> 59:41.960
 the more you will recruit

59:41.960 --> 59:43.900
 these so-called high threshold motor units,

59:43.900 --> 59:45.460
 the ones that are hard to get to,

59:45.460 --> 59:47.620
 the more you will kick off the cascades of things

59:47.620 --> 59:52.200
 within muscle that stimulate muscle growth and strength.

59:52.200 --> 59:56.280
 So if you have muscles that are challenging to contract,

59:56.280 --> 59:58.180
 it's going to take more sets

59:58.180 --> 1:00:02.180
 in order to stimulate the desired effect in those muscles,

1:00:02.180 --> 1:00:04.420
 not fewer, okay?

1:00:04.420 --> 1:00:06.300
 If you have muscles that you are very good

1:00:06.300 --> 1:00:09.540
 at generating force within, it's going to take fewer sets.

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:10.660
 Now, how many sets?

1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:12.580
 You are going to have to determine that.

1:00:12.580 --> 1:00:13.420
 It's going to depend.

1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:15.300
 For those of you that are using like 50%

1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:17.480
 of your one repetition maximum,

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:19.300
 because you're doing a lot of repetitions,

1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:21.240
 you might find that three or four,

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:24.120
 five sets will maintain the muscle.

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.860
 You might decide to do that once at one point in the week

1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:28.500
 and then do it again, right?

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:29.740
 So if you're going for 10 sets a week,

1:00:29.740 --> 1:00:31.180
 you can divide that among two sessions,

1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:33.800
 or you can do that all in one session.

1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:36.760
 The data really show it doesn't matter.

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:39.820
 There are some differences in terms of

1:00:39.820 --> 1:00:42.360
 whether or not you're trying to generate maximum intensity

1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:43.620
 within a workout or whether or not you want

1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:44.440
 to spread that out.

1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:46.760
 But in general, resistance workouts of any kind

1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:49.900
 tend to be best favored by workouts

1:00:49.900 --> 1:00:53.700
 that are somewhere between 45 minutes and 60 minutes.

1:00:53.700 --> 1:00:55.680
 And generally not longer than 60 minutes,

1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:58.500
 because that's when all the things like cortisol

1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:00.660
 and some of the inflammatory pathways really start

1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:04.060
 to create a situation in the muscle and in the body

1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:05.420
 that's not so great for you.

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:07.460
 So it's not a hard and fast rule, you know,

1:01:07.460 --> 1:01:10.120
 that the ax doesn't drop at 60 minutes,

1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:11.980
 but it's pretty clear that performing

1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:14.260
 this five to 15 sets per week,

1:01:14.260 --> 1:01:15.660
 whether or not it's in one workout

1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:17.980
 or whether that's divided up across multiple workouts

1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:19.520
 is really what's going to be most beneficial.

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.760
 And please do keep in mind Henneman's size principle

1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:24.060
 and the recruitment of motor units.

1:01:24.060 --> 1:01:26.300
 And remember the better you are at contracting

1:01:26.300 --> 1:01:28.700
 particular muscles and isolating those muscles,

1:01:28.700 --> 1:01:30.860
 the fewer sets likely you need to do

1:01:30.860 --> 1:01:33.260
 in order to get the desired effect.

1:01:33.260 --> 1:01:35.420
 Now, what about people who have been training for a while?

1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:37.180
 If you're somebody who's been doing weight training

1:01:37.180 --> 1:01:40.460
 for a while, the data point to the fact

1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:43.120
 that more volume can be beneficial,

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.620
 even for muscles that you are very efficient

1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:47.180
 at contracting.

1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:50.420
 Now, the curve on this, the graph on this

1:01:50.420 --> 1:01:52.800
 begins again at about five sets per week

1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:54.540
 for maintaining a given muscle group

1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:59.140
 and extends all the way out to 25 or 30 sets per week.

1:01:59.140 --> 1:02:03.660
 However, there are individuals who for whatever reason

1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:05.260
 can generate so much force,

1:02:05.260 --> 1:02:07.860
 they're so good at training muscles

1:02:07.860 --> 1:02:09.620
 that they can generate so much force

1:02:09.620 --> 1:02:12.700
 in just four or six or eight sets

1:02:12.700 --> 1:02:14.460
 that doing this large volume of work

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:16.640
 is actually going to be counterproductive.

1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:19.180
 So everyone needs to figure out for themselves,

1:02:19.180 --> 1:02:21.780
 first of all, how often you're willing to do resistance

1:02:21.780 --> 1:02:23.200
 exercise of any kind.

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:25.180
 And again, it doesn't matter if you're using bands

1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:26.500
 or weights or body weight.

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:28.700
 For instance, if you're doing chin ups,

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.100
 chances are, unless you are very strong,

1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:32.500
 that you're not using weights,

1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:34.780
 you're just using something that you can hold onto.

1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:36.260
 Or if you're doing pushups,

1:02:36.260 --> 1:02:39.580
 some of you will be working in that 30 to 80%

1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:41.660
 of your one repetition maximum range.

1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:43.740
 It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be

1:02:43.740 --> 1:02:46.220
 moving weights in a gym, for instance.

1:02:46.220 --> 1:02:49.140
 So the purpose here is to figure out

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:50.900
 what muscles you're trying to train.

1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:53.140
 That's an issue that we'll talk about in a moment.

1:02:53.140 --> 1:02:55.500
 And then it does appear that somewhere between

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:59.560
 five and 15 sets per week is going to be

1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:01.860
 what's the thing that's going to work for most people.

1:03:01.860 --> 1:03:03.900
 Now this is based on a tremendous amount of work

1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:05.680
 that was done by Andy Galpin and colleagues,

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:08.380
 Brad Schoenfield and colleagues and others.

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:13.060
 Mike Roberts, there's a huge group

1:03:13.060 --> 1:03:15.500
 of people out there doing exercise physiology

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:18.300
 and a small subset of them that are linking them

1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:20.220
 back to real world protocols

1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:22.180
 that don't just pertain to athletes.

1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:23.980
 So that's mainly what I'm focusing on today.

1:03:23.980 --> 1:03:26.160
 And surely there will be exceptions.

1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:30.500
 Now, if you are going to divide the sets across the week,

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:32.540
 you're not going to do all 10 sets, for instance,

1:03:32.540 --> 1:03:34.540
 for a given muscle group in one session,

1:03:34.540 --> 1:03:36.820
 then of course it's imperative that the muscles

1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:38.220
 recover in between sessions.

1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:40.020
 And we are going to talk about recovery

1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:43.220
 both at the systemic level, the whole nervous system

1:03:43.220 --> 1:03:46.060
 and at the local level, the nerve to muscle

1:03:46.060 --> 1:03:47.780
 and local even muscle level.

1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:49.700
 We'll talk about that in about 10 minutes

1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:51.540
 when we talk about recovery.

1:03:51.540 --> 1:03:53.540
 I do want to mention something very important,

1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:55.700
 which is that everything I'm referring to here,

1:03:55.700 --> 1:03:58.780
 it has to do with full range of motion, okay?

1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:02.100
 And you might ask, well, what about the speeds of movements?

1:04:02.100 --> 1:04:03.200
 This is actually turns out to be

1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:05.180
 a really interesting data set

1:04:05.180 --> 1:04:08.000
 for generating explosiveness and speed.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.600
 So for sprinters or throwing sports,

1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:13.640
 or for people that want to generate a lot of jumping power,

1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:16.180
 it does appear that learning to move weights

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:18.680
 as fast as you safely can,

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:21.460
 especially under moderate to heavy loads

1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:24.860
 can increase explosiveness and speed.

1:04:24.860 --> 1:04:29.860
 And most of that effect is from changes in the neurons.

1:04:30.260 --> 1:04:31.940
 It's not from changes in the muscle,

1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:34.860
 it's from changes in the way that the upper motor neurons

1:04:34.860 --> 1:04:37.220
 communicate with the lower motor neurons

1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:41.060
 and generating a pathway, a neural circuit, as we call it,

1:04:41.060 --> 1:04:44.460
 that is very efficient at generating action potentials,

1:04:44.460 --> 1:04:46.340
 which are the electricity within neurons

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:47.280
 to trigger the muscle.

1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:48.660
 Now, of course, there are events that happen

1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:49.880
 from nerve to muscle,

1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:53.620
 but the takeaway from that enormous literature, frankly,

1:04:53.620 --> 1:04:56.440
 is that if you want to get faster,

1:04:56.440 --> 1:04:59.520
 yes, it can be beneficial to get stronger,

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:02.340
 but if you want to dedicate resistance training

1:05:02.340 --> 1:05:07.340
 specifically to jumping higher, to running faster,

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:10.660
 to throwing further and these sorts of things,

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:14.520
 that learning to generate force with increasing speed

1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:15.820
 is going to be beneficial.

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:17.940
 On the flip side of that,

1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:19.660
 for people that want to get stronger,

1:05:19.660 --> 1:05:21.980
 it appears that the slowing down of the weight

1:05:21.980 --> 1:05:24.500
 as things get harder is a key parameter

1:05:24.500 --> 1:05:27.020
 in recruiting those high threshold motor units.

1:05:27.020 --> 1:05:29.420
 So let me phrase that a little bit differently.

1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:31.000
 Think about a set in the gym

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.560
 or think about a set of pushups or a set of pull-ups.

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:36.740
 Initially, you can move very fast if you like.

1:05:36.740 --> 1:05:38.260
 If you want to generate hypertrophy,

1:05:38.260 --> 1:05:40.820
 the goal really is not necessarily to move super slow,

1:05:40.820 --> 1:05:41.940
 but to isolate the muscle

1:05:41.940 --> 1:05:43.360
 and therefore not to use momentum,

1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:46.860
 rather than lift weights, as they say, challenge muscles.

1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:48.060
 If you want to get stronger,

1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:49.660
 you're going to be distributing that effort

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:52.280
 over more muscles and more of your nervous system.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:55.700
 For generating explosiveness and speed,

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:59.180
 it's very clear that learning to generate forces quickly

1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:03.020
 and to move heavy or moderately heavy loads quickly

1:06:03.020 --> 1:06:04.200
 is going to be beneficial

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:07.220
 because of the way that you train the motor neurons.

1:06:07.220 --> 1:06:09.280
 And of course, changes in the muscle.

1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:12.260
 But this could look different for different sports.

1:06:12.260 --> 1:06:14.260
 And obviously, you want to make safety paramount.

1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:16.300
 If you're injured, you're not going to be able to train

1:06:16.300 --> 1:06:19.680
 at all for sport or for any purpose that is.

1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:20.780
 And so what this would involve

1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:24.980
 is something like 60 to 75% of a one repetition maximum.

1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:26.500
 And then in a controlled way,

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:28.940
 moving that as quickly as one can

1:06:28.940 --> 1:06:30.300
 throughout the entire set.

1:06:30.300 --> 1:06:32.440
 And certainly not going to failure

1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:33.940
 because as you approach failure,

1:06:33.940 --> 1:06:36.140
 the inability to move the weight with good form,

1:06:36.140 --> 1:06:38.240
 the weight inevitably slows down.

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:41.080
 In fact, there are a lot of new technologies now

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.840
 that are focused on informing people

1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:46.420
 of how quickly the bar or weight is moving.

1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:48.900
 I saw an advertisement for this the other day.

1:06:48.900 --> 1:06:51.420
 There are things that people can attach to bars

1:06:51.420 --> 1:06:53.580
 that will literally speak to you as you're doing a set

1:06:53.580 --> 1:06:55.820
 and inform you whether or not you're moving

1:06:55.820 --> 1:06:58.340
 four times more slowly per rep

1:06:58.340 --> 1:06:59.480
 than you were at the beginning

1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:02.420
 and trying to hone in on the exact speed of movement.

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:05.540
 In talking to these experts prior to this episode,

1:07:05.540 --> 1:07:08.540
 it does appear that for sake of hypertrophy,

1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:11.380
 as long as you're not moving the muscle so quickly

1:07:11.380 --> 1:07:12.940
 that you start to distribute the effort

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:16.760
 to lots of other muscles, it doesn't really matter.

1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:20.260
 Because as the set gets harder,

1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:23.380
 the motor units that you recruit will increase,

1:07:23.380 --> 1:07:24.960
 the number of neurons that you recruit

1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:26.100
 and the number of muscle fibers,

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:27.800
 in particular these high threshold muscle fibers

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:28.640
 will increase.

1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:31.780
 And so it's really only for purposes of hypertrophy

1:07:31.780 --> 1:07:33.620
 that you really need to be concerned

1:07:33.620 --> 1:07:37.080
 about how quickly the weight is slowing down.

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:39.860
 However, if you're trying to get faster, more explosive

1:07:39.860 --> 1:07:43.380
 and generate more speed and jumping power,

1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:45.720
 throwing power, things of that sort,

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:47.480
 you never really want to use a weight

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:49.180
 or get to a portion of the set

1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:51.340
 where you're moving the bar very, very slowly.

1:07:51.340 --> 1:07:52.420
 And I'm sure as I say that,

1:07:52.420 --> 1:07:53.780
 some of the exercise physiologists

1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:55.300
 and advanced trainers out there

1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:57.280
 will come after me with pitchforks, which is fine.

1:07:57.280 --> 1:07:58.900
 I'd love to see the literature that shows

1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:01.860
 that low gear, slow movements with very heavy weights

1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:04.720
 can indeed improve explosiveness.

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.420
 And that may in fact be the case,

1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:08.620
 but the data that I was able to access

1:08:08.620 --> 1:08:10.980
 was essentially as I described just a moment ago.

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:12.480
 So as you're probably starting to realize,

1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:16.280
 you need to customize a resistance practice

1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:18.300
 for your particular needs and goals.

1:08:18.300 --> 1:08:21.060
 And I certainly am not the first to suggest

1:08:21.060 --> 1:08:23.100
 that people periodize their training,

1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:24.220
 that they do things from anywhere

1:08:24.220 --> 1:08:27.120
 from one month to six months and to see how it goes.

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.340
 And to make modifications as they go.

1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:30.760
 Because the nervous system,

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.780
 in particular the neuromuscular system,

1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:35.340
 changes very quickly at the beginning of training.

1:08:35.340 --> 1:08:37.900
 In fact, some of the changes that one can see

1:08:37.900 --> 1:08:42.900
 when they first embrace or start a resistance training

1:08:43.100 --> 1:08:46.380
 can be very remarkable, but they tend to slow over time.

1:08:46.380 --> 1:08:47.860
 So we've talked about a few principles.

1:08:47.860 --> 1:08:49.780
 The fact that you need to get sufficient volume,

1:08:49.780 --> 1:08:51.420
 you need at least five sets to maintain,

1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:53.540
 and you probably need about 10 sets per muscle group

1:08:53.540 --> 1:08:55.380
 in order to improve muscle.

1:08:55.380 --> 1:08:58.660
 That moving weights of moderate to moderately heavy weight

1:08:58.660 --> 1:09:00.620
 quickly is going to be best for explosiveness.

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:04.380
 That isolating muscles and really contracting muscles hard,

1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:06.420
 something that you can test by just

1:09:06.420 --> 1:09:08.140
 when you're outside the training session,

1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:09.620
 seeing whether or not you can cramp the muscle hard,

1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:13.160
 will really, will tell you your capacity

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:15.020
 to improve hypertrophy

1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:18.040
 or to engage strength changes in that muscle.

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:20.800
 That your ability to contract a muscle hard

1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:23.180
 is inversely related to the number of sets

1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:25.300
 that you should do in order to isolate

1:09:25.300 --> 1:09:27.600
 and stimulate that muscle.

1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:30.480
 And there are some other things that can enhance

1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.220
 the whole process of building nerve to muscle connections,

1:09:34.220 --> 1:09:36.740
 making them more efficient and generating, if you like,

1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:39.080
 more strength and hypertrophy.

1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:42.660
 One of them, I loathe to say,

1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:46.580
 I was told is in-between set contractions.

1:09:46.580 --> 1:09:49.540
 The other name for this is the people in the gym,

1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:52.260
 does typically seem to be guys in the gym

1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:54.420
 flexing their muscles in-between sets.

1:09:54.420 --> 1:09:57.620
 And indeed, the research supports the fact

1:09:57.620 --> 1:10:00.220
 that contractions of about 30 seconds

1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:02.240
 in-between the actual work sets,

1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:05.260
 they're not going to favor better performance

1:10:05.260 --> 1:10:06.100
 on the work sets.

1:10:06.100 --> 1:10:07.840
 If anything, they're going to compromise them,

1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:10.780
 but those hard contractions in-between sets

1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:14.420
 for a variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism,

1:10:14.420 --> 1:10:16.060
 as well as what we talked about before,

1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:18.060
 which are stress, tension, and damage,

1:10:18.060 --> 1:10:20.900
 they seem to improve stress, tension, and damage

1:10:20.900 --> 1:10:22.460
 and the nerve to muscle contraction

1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:24.460
 in ways that facilitate hypertrophy.

1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:26.980
 In other words, if you see that person flexing

1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:28.700
 in-between sets in the gym,

1:10:28.700 --> 1:10:31.460
 provided that they're really isolating that muscle

1:10:31.460 --> 1:10:35.220
 and provided it's one that they ought to be improving,

1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:37.300
 not one of these people that always skips leg day

1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:41.140
 type of people, these people are highly asymmetric,

1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:42.520
 although that's up to them,

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:45.380
 that process of flexing in-between sets

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:48.860
 does seem to improve the nerve to muscle connection

1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:51.020
 and enhance hypertrophy.

1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:52.420
 And I say I was loath to say it

1:10:52.420 --> 1:10:54.040
 because nowadays with phones,

1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:58.300
 it seems like the end of every set includes a selfie,

1:10:58.300 --> 1:11:00.300
 and that's sort of like the 11th rep of every set.

1:11:00.300 --> 1:11:03.000
 I like to joke, it seems like very few people are capable

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.860
 of actually going into the gym and doing a workout

1:11:05.860 --> 1:11:07.100
 without taking a picture of themselves,

1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:10.000
 which I think is fine if that's your thing.

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.960
 Although I must say that the athletes that I know,

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.220
 and even the recreational athletes that I know

1:11:15.220 --> 1:11:17.500
 who seem to get the most out of their training

1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:18.900
 and who also seem to get the most

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:20.300
 out of other aspects of their life

1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:22.140
 seem to be able to control their phone behavior

1:11:22.140 --> 1:11:24.100
 both in the gym and outside of the gym.

1:11:24.100 --> 1:11:26.880
 But that's more of an editorial point there.

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:28.000
 In an earlier episode,

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.720
 I talked about estrogen and testosterone.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:31.820
 And during that discussion,

1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:34.220
 I talked about the use of resistance exercise

1:11:34.220 --> 1:11:37.340
 specifically for increasing testosterone,

1:11:37.340 --> 1:11:39.420
 both in men and in women.

1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:44.100
 And indeed that is a powerful effect of resistance exercise.

1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:48.660
 And indeed it's mediated by the nerve to muscle connections.

1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:51.220
 We talked about that in that earlier episode.

1:11:51.220 --> 1:11:53.100
 I just want to briefly mention that protocol

1:11:53.100 --> 1:11:54.620
 since it's distinctly different

1:11:54.620 --> 1:11:56.980
 from the other protocols I've talked about today.

1:11:56.980 --> 1:11:59.820
 The protocols I've talked about today thus far

1:11:59.820 --> 1:12:04.420
 of explosive movements or of hypertrophy based training

1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:07.500
 provided the training is 60 minutes or less

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.380
 will cause increases in serum testosterone

1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:12.960
 that's been shown over and over again.

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:16.580
 And if the session extends too long past 75 minutes

1:12:16.580 --> 1:12:18.620
 and is of sufficiently high intensity,

1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:21.960
 chances are testosterone levels will start to drop

1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:24.380
 and cortisol levels will go up

1:12:24.380 --> 1:12:26.460
 in ways that can be detrimental to recovery

1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:28.700
 and the goals of the training.

1:12:28.700 --> 1:12:31.100
 But that's different than training

1:12:31.100 --> 1:12:34.760
 that's specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.

1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:36.780
 Duncan French, who's one of the directors

1:12:36.780 --> 1:12:38.740
 of the UFC Performance Center,

1:12:38.740 --> 1:12:40.220
 when he was a graduate student

1:12:40.220 --> 1:12:43.060
 at University of Connecticut stores did some beautiful work.

1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:46.660
 He and his colleagues found the ideal training protocols

1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:48.780
 for stimulating testosterone release,

1:12:48.780 --> 1:12:50.860
 which is something that many people want to do

1:12:50.860 --> 1:12:52.580
 for a variety of reasons.

1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:57.580
 And that involved doing six sets of 10 repetitions

1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:02.220
 even if it requires lightening the weight

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:06.020
 on one set to the next with about two minutes,

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:08.260
 120 seconds rest in between sets,

1:13:08.260 --> 1:13:12.540
 which if you think about it is pretty short rest

1:13:12.540 --> 1:13:15.500
 and is pretty darn hard work.

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:16.540
 Now what's interesting

1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:18.740
 is that there's a very limited threshold

1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:20.100
 for increasing testosterone.

1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:24.820
 That protocol of six sets of 10 repetitions

1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:27.980
 led to these big increases in serum testosterone.

1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:29.880
 But if people did 10 sets of 10,

1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:32.260
 so just four more repetitions per set,

1:13:32.260 --> 1:13:34.420
 then testosterone did not increase.

1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:35.260
 In fact, you got more

1:13:35.260 --> 1:13:37.280
 of this catabolic cortisol-like pathway.

1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:38.420
 You get other benefits

1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:41.160
 from the so-called 10 sets of 10 protocol,

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:43.040
 but not the testosterone increase

1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:45.940
 and maybe even reductions in testosterone.

1:13:45.940 --> 1:13:46.940
 Now it's important to point out

1:13:46.940 --> 1:13:48.460
 that that six sets of 10 was done

1:13:48.460 --> 1:13:50.300
 with big compound movements.

1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:53.020
 So things like squats or deadlifts or chin ups

1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:54.100
 or things of that sort.

1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:56.340
 And those were done as single sessions,

1:13:56.340 --> 1:13:59.720
 not in concert with a bunch of other exercise.

1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:02.380
 Although if athletes are doing that,

1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:03.940
 there's no reason why they couldn't also do

1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:06.740
 other types of training elsewhere in the week.

1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:07.740
 I asked Duncan about this

1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:09.820
 and he mentioned that that done twice a week

1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:14.140
 is probably the maximum amount that anyone could do that

1:14:14.140 --> 1:14:16.540
 and still maintain this increase in testosterone.

1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:18.580
 It's a very interesting protocol

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:21.780
 because as a neuroscientist,

1:14:21.780 --> 1:14:24.840
 it's amazing to me that six sets of 10 repetitions

1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:27.860
 with something causes a distinctly, excuse me,

1:14:27.860 --> 1:14:30.300
 causes a distinctly different result

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:31.980
 in terms of hormone output

1:14:31.980 --> 1:14:34.900
 than 10 sets of 10 of the exact same movement.

1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:37.820
 And it speaks to the exquisite way

1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:40.140
 in which nerve to muscle connections

1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:43.960
 dictate the whole physiology of your entire system.

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:46.540
 If there's a theme that I really want to bring forward today

1:14:46.540 --> 1:14:50.360
 is that weight training or resistance training of any kind

1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:53.700
 is really used for either systemic effects, right?

1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:56.140
 10% of training done where you're feeling that burn

1:14:56.140 --> 1:14:57.800
 which means lactate will be present

1:14:57.800 --> 1:14:59.420
 and sending signals to your brain

1:14:59.420 --> 1:15:01.940
 and to your heart and to your liver that are beneficial

1:15:01.940 --> 1:15:05.220
 or isolating muscles which may also generate

1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:07.380
 a kind of a lactate

1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:10.500
 or which is associated with the burn result

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:13.060
 but that isolation of muscles is distinctly different.

1:15:13.060 --> 1:15:15.260
 So systemic versus isolated.

1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:16.980
 Those are the two general ways

1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:19.580
 in which resistance training can be applied.

1:15:19.580 --> 1:15:21.460
 So I just wanted to mention that earlier protocol

1:15:21.460 --> 1:15:24.340
 because it's well supported by the literature.

1:15:24.340 --> 1:15:27.280
 If you were to incorporate that protocol, you might ask,

1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:29.080
 well then can you do any other weight training

1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:29.920
 during the week?

1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:32.360
 Sure, of course you can provided you're recovering.

1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:35.340
 So let's talk about how you know if you're recovering,

1:15:35.340 --> 1:15:36.940
 how you know if a muscle is recovered

1:15:36.940 --> 1:15:39.460
 and how you know if your whole system is recovered

1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:42.340
 because recovery is what dictates whether or not

1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:44.780
 you can come back and do more work of a different kind.

1:15:44.780 --> 1:15:48.380
 Meaning, I don't know, you do leg training one day,

1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:49.900
 can you and should you come back

1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:52.300
 and do upper body training the next day?

1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:55.100
 And it dictates whether or not you'll see any improvement

1:15:55.100 --> 1:15:56.980
 from session to session at all.

1:15:56.980 --> 1:15:58.280
 Before I talk about recovery,

1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.440
 I just want to make sure I nail down the details

1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:03.160
 that I was able to extract from the literature

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:05.580
 and from my conversation with Dr. Galpin.

1:16:05.580 --> 1:16:08.900
 If you're wondering how quickly to perform repetitions

1:16:08.900 --> 1:16:11.500
 for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,

1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:14.100
 anywhere from a half a second per repetition,

1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:16.140
 all the way up to eight seconds per repetition,

1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:18.220
 it doesn't seem to matter.

1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:20.140
 Again, if you're thinking about explosiveness

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:21.380
 or building speed,

1:16:21.380 --> 1:16:23.280
 or you're specifically using resistance training

1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:25.380
 to build endurance, that's a separate matter.

1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:27.180
 We talked about explosiveness and speed,

1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:29.380
 I'll talk about endurance in a few moments.

1:16:29.380 --> 1:16:32.700
 We also talked about in-between set contractions,

1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:36.020
 the so-called selfie effect of people flexing

1:16:36.020 --> 1:16:36.920
 a particular muscle,

1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:39.260
 isolating a particular muscle between sets.

1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:42.000
 Just want to mention that would be a terrible thing to do

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.180
 if your goal is performance on sets.

1:16:44.180 --> 1:16:46.900
 So moving a particular amount of weight,

1:16:46.900 --> 1:16:49.020
 that's actually going to diminish the amount of weight

1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:51.980
 that you can move, it's going to enhance muscle growth

1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:55.500
 and it's going to enhance the nerve to muscle isolation

1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:57.060
 of that particular pathway.

1:16:57.060 --> 1:16:59.640
 So again, that flexing between sets

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:03.780
 is going to favor hypertrophy, not performance.

1:17:03.780 --> 1:17:06.200
 If you're trying to get stronger,

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:07.560
 you're trying to move more weights,

1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:09.100
 you're trying to distribute work

1:17:09.100 --> 1:17:11.040
 and you're trying to do maybe skill training

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:13.560
 with resistance, then flexing between sets

1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:16.500
 is absolutely the wrong thing to do for obvious reasons,

1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:18.160
 you're fatiguing the muscle further.

1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:21.100
 Just remaining still or walking around a little bit

1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:23.060
 has been shown to be beneficial

1:17:23.060 --> 1:17:25.860
 in terms of moving some of the lactate out of the muscle,

1:17:25.860 --> 1:17:28.100
 as well as just recovering between sets.

1:17:28.100 --> 1:17:30.060
 Now, how long to recover between sets?

1:17:30.060 --> 1:17:32.560
 There's a question for the testosterone protocol,

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:33.900
 Duncan French and colleagues found

1:17:33.900 --> 1:17:35.060
 that it was about two minutes,

1:17:35.060 --> 1:17:38.540
 keeping that really on the clock, two minutes, not longer.

1:17:38.540 --> 1:17:41.080
 For hypertrophy and for strength gains,

1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:43.780
 it does seem that resting anywhere from two minutes

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:47.140
 or even three or four, even five or six minutes

1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:48.180
 can be beneficial.

1:17:48.180 --> 1:17:51.460
 And if you're interested in expanding the volume of work

1:17:51.460 --> 1:17:53.860
 that you can do in a given session,

1:17:53.860 --> 1:17:57.240
 at high capacity, at high intensity with a given weight,

1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:00.700
 please see the episode that I did on cold and performance

1:18:00.700 --> 1:18:02.080
 about supercharging performance,

1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:04.540
 which is based on the work of my colleague, Craig Heller

1:18:04.540 --> 1:18:06.180
 in the biology department at Stanford,

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:07.820
 which talks about palmer cooling,

1:18:07.820 --> 1:18:10.140
 about how you can cool the core of the body

1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:11.480
 best through the palms

1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:14.120
 using these particular venous portals

1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:16.680
 that are only present in your hands.

1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:20.020
 People are now doing this with ice packs or with gel packs,

1:18:20.020 --> 1:18:21.460
 there are a number of different ways one can do this,

1:18:21.460 --> 1:18:23.220
 I talk all about that in that episode,

1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:27.380
 it allows you to do more repetitions and more work

1:18:27.380 --> 1:18:29.080
 at a given weight over time.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:31.540
 So rather than getting 10 repetitions

1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:33.780
 and then eight and then seven and then six

1:18:33.780 --> 1:18:35.820
 through proper use of palmer cooling,

1:18:35.820 --> 1:18:39.300
 one can do 10, 10, 10, 10, and even add sets.

1:18:39.300 --> 1:18:41.340
 And that's one way that one can accomplish

1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:43.040
 higher volume work

1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:45.500
 without having to drop the weight considerably.

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:48.020
 So that's where you can hit that really sweet spot

1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:50.220
 if that's your goal of getting strong

1:18:50.220 --> 1:18:52.180
 and generating some hypertrophy.

1:18:52.180 --> 1:18:55.380
 Because as soon as you have to drop to lighter weights,

1:18:55.380 --> 1:18:56.220
 excuse me,

1:18:56.220 --> 1:18:59.180
 then you're shifting more towards hypertrophy and endurance

1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:01.420
 and less toward strength in a given muscle.

1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:03.220
 So check out that episode.

1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:06.660
 The last thing besides between set contractions

1:19:06.660 --> 1:19:08.740
 and whether or not you're distributing work

1:19:08.740 --> 1:19:11.300
 or whether or not you're really trying to isolate muscles

1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:14.340
 is this notion of pre-exhausting muscles.

1:19:14.340 --> 1:19:16.700
 It's been shown over and over again

1:19:16.700 --> 1:19:17.580
 that for instance,

1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:21.020
 if you want to generate force in a given muscle

1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:22.460
 and really isolate that,

1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:25.140
 doing the isolation work before a compound movement.

1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:28.060
 So this would be leg extensions,

1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:28.880
 the thing where you sit

1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:31.360
 and you extend your toes up toward the ceiling,

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:35.060
 leg extensions before squats will allow the squats

1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:37.460
 to target that muscle group more effectively.

1:19:37.460 --> 1:19:39.260
 And that makes perfectly good sense

1:19:39.260 --> 1:19:41.620
 based on the Henneman size principle

1:19:41.620 --> 1:19:43.040
 and fatiguing motor units.

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:44.780
 It should be obvious why that's the case.

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:48.300
 But of course that's going to be anti-performance

1:19:48.300 --> 1:19:50.020
 in terms of how much weight you can lift

1:19:50.020 --> 1:19:51.720
 and maybe even the form that you can maintain

1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:53.760
 when you move to the bigger compound movement.

1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:56.120
 So you really have to ask yourself a number of questions.

1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.980
 How good are you at isolating a given muscle?

1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:01.140
 Therefore, how many sets do you want to do?

1:20:01.140 --> 1:20:03.700
 How often are you willing to train?

1:20:03.700 --> 1:20:05.500
 Therefore, how many sets are you going to do

1:20:05.500 --> 1:20:06.660
 in a given session

1:20:06.660 --> 1:20:09.460
 versus how many are you going to distribute across the week?

1:20:09.460 --> 1:20:10.860
 Are you aiming for performance?

1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:12.460
 Are you going to distribute that work

1:20:12.460 --> 1:20:14.500
 across the nervous system and musculature?

1:20:14.500 --> 1:20:15.660
 Are you trying to move weights?

1:20:15.660 --> 1:20:17.160
 Are you trying to challenge muscles?

1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:18.800
 If you're trying to challenge muscles,

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:20.620
 then you really want to focus on things

1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:21.780
 like this pre-exhausting,

1:20:21.780 --> 1:20:24.540
 the isolation of a muscle before the compound movement.

1:20:24.540 --> 1:20:26.360
 Your performance on compound movements

1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:28.500
 will absolutely suffer,

1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:30.540
 but your ability to isolate that muscle

1:20:30.540 --> 1:20:31.920
 and generate hypertrophy

1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:34.360
 through the accumulation of larger myosin,

1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:36.920
 those bigger balloons, will benefit.

1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:39.500
 And once again, if you're trying to get faster,

1:20:39.500 --> 1:20:42.440
 then the speed of the movement really matters.

1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:43.940
 So how do we know if we've recovered?

1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:45.560
 How can we test recovery?

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:47.900
 And this is not just recovery from resistance training.

1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:49.660
 This is recovery from running,

1:20:49.660 --> 1:20:51.260
 recovery from swimming.

1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:53.180
 Up until now, I've been talking about resistance training

1:20:53.180 --> 1:20:54.680
 more or less in a vacuum.

1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:56.740
 I haven't even touched on the fact

1:20:56.740 --> 1:20:57.920
 that many people are running

1:20:57.920 --> 1:20:59.400
 and they're doing resistance training,

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:02.500
 or they're swimming and they're doing resistance training.

1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:06.060
 It's not simply the case that if a given muscle is fatigued,

1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:07.580
 you can just work other muscles

1:21:07.580 --> 1:21:11.380
 because even if you've beautifully isolated a muscle,

1:21:11.380 --> 1:21:13.380
 let's say you have incredible abilities

1:21:13.380 --> 1:21:16.980
 to isolate just your quadriceps, for instance,

1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:19.300
 and you do a workout where you isolate your quadriceps,

1:21:19.300 --> 1:21:21.020
 you do your six sets of intense work,

1:21:21.020 --> 1:21:22.240
 or maybe use Palmer cooling

1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:24.800
 and you're able to do 12 sets of intense work,

1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:29.260
 and you're done, and that muscle group the next day

1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:30.640
 is certainly not going to be recovered

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:33.220
 unless you're somebody who's extraordinary at recovery

1:21:33.220 --> 1:21:36.020
 or you're enhancing your recovery through chemical means,

1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:38.040
 which we'll talk about at the end.

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:41.580
 Well, you can assess systemic recovery,

1:21:41.580 --> 1:21:43.660
 meaning your nervous system

1:21:43.660 --> 1:21:46.940
 and your nervous system's ability to generate force

1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:51.260
 both distributed and isolated through three main tests.

1:21:51.260 --> 1:21:54.260
 And fortunately, these tests are very simple

1:21:54.260 --> 1:21:57.420
 and two of them are essentially zero costs

1:21:57.420 --> 1:21:58.680
 require no equipment.

1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:02.460
 HRV, heart rate variability,

1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:04.640
 has made its way finally

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:07.200
 into the forefront of exercise physiology

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:09.380
 and even into the popular discussion.

1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:11.280
 I've talked about HRV before,

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:13.420
 how when we exhale our heart rate slows down

1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:14.660
 because of the way that our diaphragm

1:22:14.660 --> 1:22:16.440
 is connected to our heart and to our brain

1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:18.360
 and the way our brain is connected to our heart.

1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:19.200
 Excuse me.

1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:21.380
 When we inhale, our heart rate speeds up

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:23.980
 and that is the basis of heart rate variability.

1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:26.180
 Heart rate variability is good.

1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:28.480
 It means that you're breathing properly.

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:29.900
 And when I say it's good,

1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:32.300
 it means you want a lot of heart rate variability.

1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:34.060
 You don't want a heart rate

1:22:34.060 --> 1:22:37.240
 that is high or low consistently over time.

1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:38.820
 That might come as a bit of a surprise

1:22:38.820 --> 1:22:40.340
 for you endurance athletes

1:22:40.340 --> 1:22:42.140
 who probably are trying to accomplish

1:22:42.140 --> 1:22:44.180
 your endurance work at a steady cadence

1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:45.660
 and really hit that nice sweet spot

1:22:45.660 --> 1:22:47.060
 where you're breathing rhythmically,

1:22:47.060 --> 1:22:48.300
 your heart rate's going rhythmically,

1:22:48.300 --> 1:22:49.820
 you're in that steady heart rate

1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:50.960
 and then away from exercise,

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:53.220
 you have a nice low heart rate as they say.

1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:54.780
 Well, nice low heart rate

1:22:54.780 --> 1:22:56.880
 isn't necessarily always so nice.

1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:58.540
 Turns out that introducing bouts

1:22:58.540 --> 1:23:00.540
 of increasing your heart rate during exercise

1:23:00.540 --> 1:23:02.360
 and even through your waking day,

1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:05.260
 through stressful events even is provided there brief

1:23:05.260 --> 1:23:06.420
 is beneficial.

1:23:06.420 --> 1:23:10.160
 A good nerve to heart system

1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:12.480
 benefits from being able to increase heart rate

1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:13.420
 and decrease heart rate.

1:23:13.420 --> 1:23:15.780
 Heart rate variability is good.

1:23:15.780 --> 1:23:16.980
 So you don't want high heart rate,

1:23:16.980 --> 1:23:19.960
 you don't want low heart rate all the time.

1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:21.260
 But heart rate variability

1:23:21.260 --> 1:23:23.260
 is difficult for a lot of people to measure.

1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:25.380
 There are some devices that will allow you to do that,

1:23:25.380 --> 1:23:27.940
 various watches and devices.

1:23:27.940 --> 1:23:31.100
 There are more devices becoming available all the time.

1:23:31.100 --> 1:23:33.500
 Hopefully soon some that are integrated with your phone

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:36.660
 that involve no contact or anything on your body.

1:23:36.660 --> 1:23:39.620
 But those do carry some costs

1:23:39.620 --> 1:23:41.300
 and they are not perfect yet.

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:42.780
 The measures of heart rate variability

1:23:42.780 --> 1:23:45.100
 that one can use while in movement

1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:48.220
 are still in that phase I would say

1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:51.000
 of technology development where everyone isn't using them.

1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.340
 Let's leave it at that.

1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:53.580
 There are two measures however,

1:23:53.580 --> 1:23:54.780
 whether or not you recovered

1:23:54.780 --> 1:23:56.540
 that you can use first thing in the morning

1:23:56.540 --> 1:23:57.660
 when you wake up,

1:23:57.660 --> 1:23:59.640
 maybe after five, 10 minutes if you like,

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:02.020
 but ideally right when you wake up

1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:04.740
 in order to assess how well recovered you are

1:24:04.740 --> 1:24:06.680
 and therefore whether or not you should train

1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:09.000
 your whole system at all that day.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.440
 The first one is grip strength.

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:15.460
 Grip strength, the ability to generate force

1:24:15.460 --> 1:24:17.220
 at the level of squeezing the fist

1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:19.480
 or squeezing down on something

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:22.540
 might seem like kind of a trivial way to assess recovery

1:24:22.540 --> 1:24:25.140
 but it's not because it relates to your ability

1:24:25.140 --> 1:24:26.700
 to use your upper motor neurons

1:24:26.700 --> 1:24:28.260
 to control your lower motor neurons

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:30.700
 and to generate isolated force.

1:24:30.700 --> 1:24:33.520
 And so that's really what you're assessing when you do that.

1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:37.620
 Some people will use one of these grip tools

1:24:37.620 --> 1:24:39.940
 or there's a Costello has this toy

1:24:39.940 --> 1:24:43.720
 that's shaped like a donut and it's this hard rubber.

1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:45.080
 And I've tried this before,

1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:47.660
 if I've been working really hard, not sleeping very well

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:48.760
 or I've been training a lot,

1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:51.540
 any one or combination of those things, my grip suffers.

1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:53.280
 I can't actually squeeze that thing down

1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:54.120
 as much as I can.

1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:57.360
 Costello because he was born with like a 24 inch neck

1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:59.260
 and even though he's never touched a weight,

1:24:59.260 --> 1:25:01.340
 somehow he can just clamp down on that thing

1:25:01.340 --> 1:25:03.700
 and he can turn it into a pancake with ease

1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:06.040
 and he likes to chuckle while I struggle with this thing.

1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:07.640
 But on a good day, I can squeeze this thing

1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:10.240
 so that I eliminate the hole in the donut, so to speak.

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:13.700
 You can also take a floor weight and, excuse me,

1:25:13.700 --> 1:25:16.360
 a floor scale and squeeze the scale

1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:18.460
 and see how much force you can generate.

1:25:18.460 --> 1:25:20.780
 I would do that as a baseline to establish

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:22.980
 what you can do when you're well rested.

1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:24.180
 And then if you do that in the morning,

1:25:24.180 --> 1:25:25.620
 you can see whether or not you're able

1:25:25.620 --> 1:25:27.420
 to generate the same amount of force

1:25:27.420 --> 1:25:29.380
 or you could use the rubber donut or something.

1:25:29.380 --> 1:25:30.780
 A lot of this is very subjective.

1:25:30.780 --> 1:25:32.760
 With the scale, you're really trying to assess

1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:35.060
 whether or not you can generate the same amount of force.

1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:39.060
 If you start seeing a 10% or 20% certainly reduction in that,

1:25:39.060 --> 1:25:39.900
 that's concerning.

1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:43.180
 It means that your system, your nervous system as a whole,

1:25:43.180 --> 1:25:45.420
 it's not necessarily fatigued.

1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:48.500
 It's that the pathways from nerve to muscle

1:25:48.500 --> 1:25:51.160
 are still in the process of rewiring themselves

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:52.700
 in order to generate force.

1:25:52.700 --> 1:25:55.100
 And you might think, well, I trained one muscle group one day

1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:56.580
 why am I having a hard time doing this

1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:58.180
 for a completely different muscle group?

1:25:58.180 --> 1:25:59.340
 Doesn't make any sense.

1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:01.440
 But there's something about the upper motor neuron

1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:04.020
 to lower motor neuron pathway generally

1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:06.380
 that allows you to use something like grip strength

1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:09.780
 as a kind of a thermometer, if you will,

1:26:09.780 --> 1:26:11.100
 of your ability to recover.

1:26:11.100 --> 1:26:13.540
 So look for your ability to generate force in grip

1:26:13.540 --> 1:26:14.820
 when you first wake up.

1:26:14.820 --> 1:26:17.340
 It's not going to be as good as it is at 3 p.m.

1:26:17.340 --> 1:26:19.720
 after a cup of coffee and a couple meals,

1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:22.660
 but the point isn't performance overall.

1:26:22.660 --> 1:26:24.060
 The point is to assess whether or not

1:26:24.060 --> 1:26:27.180
 you're getting better, worse, or the same from day to day.

1:26:27.180 --> 1:26:28.540
 The other one that's really terrific

1:26:28.540 --> 1:26:30.620
 and that Andy Galpin's group is using,

1:26:30.620 --> 1:26:31.820
 and I'm delighted about this

1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:32.980
 because it relates to something

1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:34.920
 that my lab is very excited about as well,

1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:36.900
 is carbon dioxide tolerance.

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:38.680
 So this is a really interesting tool

1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:41.700
 that endurance athletes, strength athletes,

1:26:41.700 --> 1:26:43.140
 I think can all benefit from.

1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:45.460
 In fact, athletes and people of all kinds,

1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:46.580
 even if you're not an athlete,

1:26:46.580 --> 1:26:48.340
 even if you're not exercising at all,

1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:49.600
 there's a good question of whether or not

1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:53.500
 your system as a whole is doing okay or not.

1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:54.820
 We rely on the thermometer.

1:26:54.820 --> 1:26:56.060
 Do we have a fever or not?

1:26:56.060 --> 1:26:58.000
 We rely on subjective things.

1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.380
 Do I feel good or not?

1:26:59.380 --> 1:27:00.700
 Am I digesting well or not?

1:27:00.700 --> 1:27:02.880
 Those are all subjective.

1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.880
 The carbon dioxide tolerance test is its objective

1:27:08.060 --> 1:27:10.680
 in that it measures your capacity to engage

1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:13.000
 the so-called parasympathetic arm of your nervous system,

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.440
 which is the calming aspect of your nervous system,

1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:18.720
 and it measures your ability to consciously control

1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:21.840
 a particular skeletal muscle, which is your diaphragm.

1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:24.520
 So here's how you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.

1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:25.740
 You wake up in the morning.

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:27.800
 If you have to use the restroom first, do that,

1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:30.240
 but try and stay away from your phone.

1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:32.380
 If you have your phone, put it on airplane mode,

1:27:32.380 --> 1:27:34.760
 go to the timer or use a hand watch

1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:37.760
 or some other way of measuring time.

1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:40.500
 Stay off social media for just a few seconds.

1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:41.760
 It'll be okay.

1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:43.960
 And what you're going to do is you're going to inhale

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:45.860
 through your nose as deeply as you can.

1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:49.320
 You can do this lying down, sitting, whatever.

1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.700
 Inhale through your nose and then exhale all the way.

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:54.900
 So that's one.

1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.280
 You're going to repeat that four times, okay?

1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:02.280
 So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:05.100
 inhale, exhale, four times.

1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:07.520
 And ideally you're inhaling through the nose

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:09.040
 and you're exhaling through the mouth.

1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:10.800
 That's just the beginning

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:13.340
 of this carbon dioxide tolerance test.

1:28:13.340 --> 1:28:16.560
 Then you take a fifth inhale as deep as you can

1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:19.400
 through your nose, fill your lungs as much as you can.

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:22.280
 And if you can try and expand your,

1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:23.880
 make your stomach go out while you do that,

1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:26.000
 that means that your diaphragm is really engaged.

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:29.060
 So you're inhaling as much as you possibly can.

1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:33.440
 Then hit the timer and your goal is to release that air

1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:36.880
 as slowly as possible through your mouth.

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:39.520
 So it looks like you have a tiny, tiny little straw

1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:41.280
 in your mouth and you're letting it go

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:46.960
 as slowly as you possibly can.

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:50.680
 Measure what we call the carbon dioxide blow off time

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:52.020
 or discard rate.

1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:55.680
 I know you can all sit with lungs empty

1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:59.860
 after you eliminate all that air, but don't lie to yourself.

1:28:59.860 --> 1:29:02.560
 Don't stop the timer when you've been sitting

1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:04.060
 with your lungs empty for a while,

1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:07.760
 stop the timer when you are finally no longer able

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:09.840
 to exhale any more air.

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:14.080
 So you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:15.960
 inhale, exhale slowly.

1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:17.960
 I just said it quickly for sake of time.

1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:20.560
 Then you do this fifth big inhale through your mouth

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:22.220
 and then,

1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:28.400
 and I'm not going to do it for the full duration.

1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:30.500
 And then you're measuring that time.

1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:34.840
 Your carbon dioxide discard rate will be somewhere

1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:39.320
 between one second and presumably two minutes.

1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:42.520
 Two minutes would be a heroic carbon dioxide discard time.

1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:45.400
 30 seconds would be more typical.

1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:47.760
 20 seconds would be fast.

1:29:47.760 --> 1:29:52.640
 If your carbon dioxide discard time is 20

1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:55.520
 or 25 seconds or less,

1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:58.600
 you are not necessarily recovered

1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:01.520
 from your previous day's activities.

1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:02.860
 There's ways to push through this,

1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:05.160
 but hold onto that thought for a moment.

1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:07.860
 If your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere

1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:12.020
 between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds,

1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:16.800
 you are in what we would call kind of the green zone

1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:21.800
 where you are in a position to do more physical work.

1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:24.560
 And if your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere

1:30:24.560 --> 1:30:28.480
 between 65 and 120 seconds,

1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:31.080
 well then you have almost certainly

1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:33.160
 recovered your nervous system.

1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:34.600
 I'm not talking about the individual muscles,

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:37.680
 but your nervous system is prepared to do more work.

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:40.080
 And Andy's lab has great data on this

1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:41.880
 as it relates to exercise physiology.

1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:43.040
 I think that story should be out

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:44.800
 in the not too distant future.

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:47.360
 My lab has been using carbon dioxide discard time

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:50.620
 to look at anxiety and recovery from bouts of anxiety.

1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:52.920
 So two totally independent projects,

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:54.680
 but using the same measure.

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:58.080
 So you've got HRV, which requires some technology usually.

1:30:58.080 --> 1:30:59.680
 You've got grip strength,

1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:02.520
 which you can assess subjectively

1:31:02.520 --> 1:31:04.560
 or you can use a floor scale.

1:31:04.560 --> 1:31:06.760
 And now you have carbon dioxide tolerance.

1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:09.880
 You want to do this in the morning when you wake up

1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:12.420
 and keep track, just write down in a little book

1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:13.860
 or maybe just keep track in your mind

1:31:13.860 --> 1:31:15.840
 of your carbon dioxide discard time.

1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:19.120
 If you find that your discard times are dropping,

1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.760
 even if they're in the 40 second range or 50 second range,

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:26.380
 but normally you can do 75 seconds or 120 seconds.

1:31:26.380 --> 1:31:30.840
 If they're starting to drop by anywhere from 15 to 20%,

1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:33.400
 you're veering in the direction of not recovering.

1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:35.680
 And I'm really keen on this tool

1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:38.820
 because everybody has different recovery abilities.

1:31:38.820 --> 1:31:41.240
 Some people are eating really well and sleeping really well.

1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:42.560
 Some people have minimal stress

1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:44.800
 or can buffer stress really well.

1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:48.840
 Other people, they dissolve into a puddle of tears

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:53.520
 if they read one text message that's troubling or whatever.

1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:55.440
 And I realize, and I say that with sympathy,

1:31:55.440 --> 1:31:56.640
 I realize people have varying levels

1:31:56.640 --> 1:31:58.520
 of stress and demand in their life.

1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:02.400
 It's just impossible to prescribe an entire protocol

1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:04.200
 that says, okay, yes, you should train today

1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:05.480
 and this is exactly what you should do.

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:06.300
 No, you shouldn't.

1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:08.160
 Use carbon dioxide discard rate

1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:10.900
 because A, it's valuable, it's informative.

1:32:10.900 --> 1:32:14.120
 B, it's zero cost.

1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:16.080
 And C, it's something that you can track

1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:17.420
 objectively over time.

1:32:17.420 --> 1:32:18.760
 And that's really the key.

1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:21.800
 And I just should, I'd be remiss if I didn't say

1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:25.000
 that what carbon dioxide discard rate is tapping into

1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000
 is your ability to mechanically control your diaphragm.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.100
 Certainly that's one aspect of it,

1:32:30.100 --> 1:32:33.320
 but that relates in a very direct way to your ability

1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:36.720
 to put the brake on your stress system,

1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:39.120
 to engage the so-called parasympathetic

1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:41.880
 or calming arm of your autonomic nervous system.

1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:45.480
 And another thing that Andy Galpin's group is testing

1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:48.960
 is at the offset of training, after your run,

1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:50.840
 after your weight training session,

1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:53.540
 maybe even after your plyometrics session,

1:32:53.540 --> 1:32:55.900
 we didn't really talk about jumping and throwing

1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:57.160
 and that sort of thing.

1:32:57.160 --> 1:32:59.640
 Maybe we'll talk about it in a future episode.

1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:04.640
 But they and other groups, including some elite athletes

1:33:04.840 --> 1:33:06.640
 and other groups that are very interested

1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:10.200
 in physical performance are using a tool

1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:13.560
 where they deliberately disengage for five minutes

1:33:13.560 --> 1:33:14.740
 at the end of training.

1:33:14.740 --> 1:33:17.300
 They deliberately engage this calming

1:33:17.300 --> 1:33:19.640
 or parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.

1:33:19.640 --> 1:33:22.040
 And you can do that through any number of different tools.

1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:24.440
 I'm a big fan of respiration tools

1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:25.720
 because they're always available to you.

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.480
 Your breathing is always there.

1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:29.800
 I talk about some of these tools in previous episodes,

1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:32.800
 but you could use things like non-sleep deep rest and SDR

1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:34.240
 at the end of a training session.

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:37.240
 You could do 10 physiological size,

1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:40.180
 double inhales through the nose, followed by long exhales.

1:33:40.180 --> 1:33:41.340
 That will definitely engage

1:33:41.340 --> 1:33:44.640
 the parasympathetic nervous system at the end of training.

1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:46.560
 So rather than finish your training session

1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:50.600
 and then just hop onto your phone, serious athletes

1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:52.680
 and people who are serious about recovery,

1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:56.680
 initiate that recovery at the very end of their training.

1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:00.480
 And they start to kickstart that recovery process rather.

1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:02.440
 And they measure CO2 tolerance in the morning.

1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:04.160
 So there are several groups that are doing that.

1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:07.720
 In fact, I know several groups because I'm working with them

1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:10.980
 that are using physiological size between sets

1:34:10.980 --> 1:34:12.880
 in order to recover their nervous system

1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:16.320
 and maintain nerve to muscle contractibility,

1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:18.900
 maintain focus throughout their training session,

1:34:18.900 --> 1:34:22.200
 enhance their focus by doing a few physiological size.

1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:25.140
 So double inhale, exhale in between sets.

1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:27.760
 So they're getting very focused and very intense

1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:29.640
 about their strength work or explosiveness work

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:31.400
 or muscle isolation work during their sets.

1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:32.960
 And then in between sets,

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:35.280
 they're deliberately disengaging the nervous system

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:37.600
 and then they're re-engaging it again.

1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:39.500
 So I just wanted to emphasize that.

1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:41.520
 So recovery is a complex process.

1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:42.960
 It's got a lot of things,

1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:46.120
 but the CO2 tolerance set should be a valuable tool.

1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:47.760
 Now, another tool for recovery

1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:49.480
 that people are very excited about

1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:51.520
 is the use of cold and the ice bath.

1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:53.000
 And this is important.

1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.480
 If you are somebody who uses cold through cold shower

1:34:56.480 --> 1:34:59.280
 or ice bath or jumping in a lake or a river,

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:01.240
 whatever it is that you use to generate cold

1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:03.600
 as a recovery tool, you should be aware

1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:05.520
 that there are data starting to emerge

1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:09.040
 that if your goal is recovery or strength improvements,

1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:13.520
 using cold within the four hours following a workout,

1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:14.620
 I'm not talking about polymer cooling,

1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:15.840
 I'm talking about whole body cooling

1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:17.940
 or cooling from the neck down.

1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:19.840
 Yes, it will reduce inflammation.

1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:21.720
 Yes, it will reduce the amount

1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:23.680
 of delayed onset muscle soreness.

1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:27.060
 One readout of how intense or damaging a given workout was,

1:35:27.060 --> 1:35:28.640
 not the only readout,

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:31.320
 but it does seem to interfere with some of the things

1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:32.640
 like mTOR pathways,

1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:34.760
 the mammalian targeted rapamycin pathway

1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:38.060
 and other pathways related to inflammation

1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:41.440
 that promote muscle repair, remember, and muscle growth.

1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:43.880
 Remember, stress, tension and damage

1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:46.760
 are the stimulus for nerve to muscle connections to change

1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:49.200
 and for muscles to get bigger, stronger and better.

1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:52.140
 And so if you're getting into the ice bath after training

1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:53.560
 or taking a really cold shower

1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:55.320
 after doing resistance training,

1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:58.020
 you are likely short circuiting the improvements

1:35:58.020 --> 1:35:59.580
 that you're trying to create.

1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:03.160
 Now, athletes who are trying to recover quickly

1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:06.100
 so that they can get back into more training sessions,

1:36:06.100 --> 1:36:08.840
 or let's say you're somebody who doesn't really want

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:12.040
 to gain much strength or hypertrophy,

1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:13.880
 and you're mainly focused on endurance

1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:15.320
 and you want to do more endurance work

1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:16.180
 and you've been weight training,

1:36:16.180 --> 1:36:19.000
 well, then exposing yourself to cold can be beneficial,

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.680
 but you're not going to get as great of benefits

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:23.480
 from the resistance training.

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:25.640
 In other words, cold after resistance training

1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:27.540
 seems to short circuit some of the benefits

1:36:27.540 --> 1:36:29.080
 of that resistance training.

1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:31.040
 There are some other things that can short circuit

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:33.240
 the benefits of resistance training as well.

1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:36.980
 One of those is antihistamines.

1:36:36.980 --> 1:36:39.260
 Some interesting data were published recently,

1:36:39.260 --> 1:36:41.920
 I believe it was in Scientific Reports, yes,

1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:45.900
 that showed that antihistamines can prevent

1:36:45.900 --> 1:36:48.880
 some of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise,

1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:51.640
 of endurance type work, so running, swimming,

1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:53.840
 fairly long duration, or even sprint type work,

1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:55.960
 as well as inhibit some of the processes

1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:59.160
 associated with resistance training.

1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:01.840
 Remember, resistance training or endurance training,

1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:04.240
 that's a stimulus for stress,

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:07.380
 and the adaptation to that stress is how you get better,

1:37:07.380 --> 1:37:11.280
 that you can run further, faster, lift more weight,

1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:12.680
 hypertrophy the muscle, et cetera.

1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:14.320
 So antihistamines can be a problem.

1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:16.040
 Obviously, don't compromise your ability

1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:19.840
 to breathe completely, but antihistamines generally work

1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:22.920
 by blocking what are called mast cells, M-A-S-T.

1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:24.600
 Mast cells are really interesting cells

1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:27.920
 that we'll talk about in our month on neuroimmune function.

1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:29.200
 They travel in the bloodstream,

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:31.120
 and they're these little packets that burst open

1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:32.440
 at sites of inflammation.

1:37:33.460 --> 1:37:36.200
 Muscle damage and inflammation is a signal

1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:37.640
 that something needs to change,

1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:40.160
 and so taking antihistamines, it appears,

1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:42.620
 can disrupt some of that inflammatory process.

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:44.120
 So you actually want inflammation

1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:46.060
 during and immediately after a workout,

1:37:46.060 --> 1:37:48.900
 then you want to bring inflammation down later,

1:37:48.900 --> 1:37:50.260
 and I'll mention how to do that.

1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:52.960
 The other thing are non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.

1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:54.200
 You know their trade names.

1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:56.480
 These are painkillers that many people take.

1:37:56.480 --> 1:37:58.320
 Those, as I've mentioned in a previous episode,

1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:01.960
 can interfere with the benefits of endurance training

1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:03.960
 and the benefits of resistance training.

1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:06.200
 In addition to that, they block pain signals,

1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:09.040
 and pain is a very good signal

1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:11.240
 that you might be doing something wrong,

1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:13.500
 and so while nobody likes to be in pain,

1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:14.840
 I suppose there are probably a few people out there

1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:16.560
 like to be in pain, but that's a different story,

1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:18.380
 but nobody likes to be in pain,

1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:20.320
 the non-steroid anti-inflammatories,

1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:22.220
 the NSAIDs as they're called,

1:38:22.220 --> 1:38:25.360
 and the antihistamines seem to prevent a lot of the gains,

1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:28.320
 the improvements in endurance strength and size

1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:31.620
 that people are specifically using exercise for.

1:38:31.620 --> 1:38:33.320
 So be cautious about your use

1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:35.920
 of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:38.480
 especially within the four hours preceding

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:41.520
 or the four hours following exercise.

1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:43.300
 So I hope you're starting to get the picture.

1:38:43.300 --> 1:38:46.040
 In order to change the nerve to muscle connectivity

1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:48.160
 in ways that will better serve you,

1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:51.820
 you need a stressor during the actual training,

1:38:51.820 --> 1:38:54.740
 which particular stressor depends on your training goals,

1:38:54.740 --> 1:38:58.520
 but that stressor is almost always going to be associated

1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:00.760
 with inflammation, and then after the training,

1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:01.600
 you want to try and get

1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:03.600
 into a state of reduced inflammation,

1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:06.980
 and that's why you would do some sort of protocol,

1:39:06.980 --> 1:39:09.760
 non-sleep deep rest, which we will link to in our caption,

1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:12.300
 or perhaps you would use the hypnosis app

1:39:12.300 --> 1:39:16.800
 that we've talked about before, reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:20.460
 There's a great app for accessing deep rest states

1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:23.440
 or the physiological side to try and get the system,

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:27.080
 your system, to calm down after training.

1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:30.740
 There are also tools that one can use to reduce inflammation

1:39:30.740 --> 1:39:33.840
 at a kind of foundational level away from training,

1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:35.560
 and these are tools that I've talked

1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:39.520
 about many times before, but I'll just restate them again.

1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:42.120
 The kind of golden three, according to Andy Galpin

1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:45.160
 and the ones that he recommends are sufficient omega-3s.

1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:47.560
 Again, that can be accomplished through diet,

1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:48.540
 through whole food intake,

1:39:48.540 --> 1:39:50.360
 or through supplementation, or both.

1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:52.860
 So in general, getting above 1,000 milligrams

1:39:52.860 --> 1:39:57.580
 of EPA per day to keep inflammation low or relatively low,

1:39:57.580 --> 1:40:01.920
 vitamin D, and in some cases, magnesium malate.

1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:04.320
 Magnesium malate seems to be particularly effective

1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:07.580
 in offsetting delayed onset muscle soreness.

1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:10.040
 Soreness itself is not required

1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:13.840
 for improvements in strength, improvements in explosiveness,

1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:15.680
 improvements in hypertrophy.

1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:16.500
 That's a myth.

1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:19.240
 Now, if you do experience delayed onset muscle soreness,

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:23.240
 chances are you stressed that particular muscle pretty well,

1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:25.080
 or even maybe too well.

1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.400
 Maybe you stressed it too much and you need longer recovery.

1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:30.840
 There's a total debate out there

1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:32.240
 about whether or not you should train again

1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:33.360
 when a muscle is still sore.

1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:34.880
 I think the general takeaway is no,

1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:36.200
 that means it's not recovered.

1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.680
 And there are things, of course, like massage,

1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:41.040
 like fascial release and things of that sort,

1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:46.040
 sauna, cold, that can perhaps accelerate the movement

1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:49.360
 from soreness to not sore.

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:51.620
 But in general, the omega-3 vitamin D

1:40:51.620 --> 1:40:54.040
 and magnesium malate, excuse me,

1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:57.020
 trio seem to be an effective way to reduce inflammation

1:40:57.020 --> 1:40:58.500
 at kind of a systemic level.

1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:00.120
 But remember, you want inflammation

1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:01.860
 provided you're not damaging the muscle so much

1:41:01.860 --> 1:41:04.160
 that you're injured during the training session

1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:08.320
 because that's the stimulus for change in those muscles.

1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:10.200
 I want to talk about a few other things

1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:13.600
 that support the process of nerve to muscle communication

1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:15.440
 and touch on some of the things

1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:16.800
 that a lot of people are doing

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:19.200
 to try and quote unquote enhance their workouts

1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:21.200
 and evaluate whether or not those are, in fact,

1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.440
 enhancing workouts or not because weight training,

1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.480
 unlike a lot of other forms of exercise,

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:30.920
 has a unique aspect to it,

1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:33.600
 which is this feature that I guess some people call it

1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:36.520
 the pump, which is the fact that blood goes into the muscle

1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:37.560
 when you train.

1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:38.760
 It's the only kind of training

1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:41.360
 where you actually get a window into what the result

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:42.720
 might actually look like

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:44.520
 before you actually accomplish that result.

1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:46.680
 So if you think about when you go out for a hard run

1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:49.240
 and let's say you go out for a two mile run,

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:50.920
 let's say your goal is to break,

1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:52.480
 you want to do a sub 10 two mile.

1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:54.700
 Actually, when I went to university,

1:41:54.700 --> 1:41:57.900
 I was running cross country my senior year of high school,

1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:01.420
 and I wanted to walk on for the cross country team.

1:42:01.420 --> 1:42:02.840
 And so I went out there

1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:06.400
 and it turned out you had to do a sub 10 two mile.

1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:09.360
 And I think the best mile I ever ran in high school

1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:11.300
 was a 457, which isn't terrible.

1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:12.640
 I can't do that now.

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:15.120
 It's not even close to what high school athletes,

1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:17.120
 the best high school athletes can do now,

1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:19.680
 but that would have meant doing it back to back.

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:22.900
 So sub 10 minute two mile, they even come close.

1:42:22.900 --> 1:42:24.540
 I told Costello this story the other day

1:42:24.540 --> 1:42:25.960
 and he just kind of laughed at me.

1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:28.840
 He was like, why would you even want to run two miles?

1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:31.560
 Because Costello is built almost exclusively

1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:33.420
 of these type two fast twitch muscles

1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:35.000
 that are designed for moving objects.

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.560
 He's incredibly strong.

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:38.580
 He has been since he was a puppy.

1:42:38.580 --> 1:42:41.080
 I mean, that dog could probably drag a tractor

1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:45.320
 if he wanted to, but he can't really go far.

1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:47.000
 Whereas a greyhound or a whippet

1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.760
 or some of these other site hounds or scent hounds

1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:49.600
 can go, go, go.

1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:50.440
 They have a higher percentage

1:42:50.440 --> 1:42:52.760
 of the so-called slow twitch muscle fibers.

1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:54.980
 They are much better at endurance.

1:42:54.980 --> 1:42:58.800
 So a sub 10 two mile would have been very, very challenging.

1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:01.280
 No chance I could have done that.

1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:03.320
 I don't think even with a lot of training,

1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:08.260
 but let's say that you want to improve your performance

1:43:08.260 --> 1:43:09.740
 in a given type of exercise.

1:43:09.740 --> 1:43:12.320
 Let's talk about some of the things that seem to work

1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:17.000
 across the board to improve strength, improve hypertrophy,

1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:20.680
 and improve nerve to muscle communication and performance.

1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:22.620
 The first thing that's absolutely key

1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:24.540
 for nerve to muscle communication

1:43:24.540 --> 1:43:27.100
 and physical performance of any kind,

1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:28.600
 might not sound that exciting to you,

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:32.480
 but it is very exciting, and that's salt.

1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.520
 Nerves, nerve cells, neurons communicate with each other

1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:39.800
 and communicate with muscle by electricity,

1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:43.120
 but that electricity is generated by particular ions

1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:45.120
 moving into and out of the neuron.

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:50.120
 And the rushing in of a particular ion, sodium, salt,

1:43:50.340 --> 1:43:52.840
 is what allows nerve cells to fire.

1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:55.860
 If you don't have enough salt in your system,

1:43:55.860 --> 1:43:57.240
 your neurons and your brain

1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:00.580
 and your nerve to muscle communication will be terrible.

1:44:00.580 --> 1:44:03.680
 If you have sufficient salt, it will be excellent.

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.280
 How much salt will depend on how much water you're drinking,

1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:07.580
 how much caffeine you're drinking,

1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.820
 and how much food you're ingesting.

1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:11.920
 So, and whether or not you're taking any diuretics,

1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:14.240
 how hot it is, et cetera, how much you're sweating.

1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:16.000
 So you want to make sure that you have enough salt,

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.120
 potassium, and magnesium in your system

1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:19.660
 if you want to perform well.

1:44:19.660 --> 1:44:23.340
 I realize that salt isn't a very glamorous performance tool,

1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:24.760
 but it is vital.

1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:26.000
 It is absolutely vital.

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.160
 And the endurance athletes

1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:29.000
 and the people that train in high heat

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.160
 can speak to the fact that when your electrolytes are low,

1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:34.320
 your brain doesn't function,

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:36.040
 your body doesn't function nearly as well.

1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:38.460
 In fact, even for mental work,

1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:42.480
 for studying and for writing and for doing math and coding,

1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:43.840
 doing analytic work of any kind,

1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:46.840
 even a hard conversation that's important to you,

1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:48.800
 having sufficient electrolytes is really going to help

1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:51.000
 and being low on electrolytes won't help.

1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:52.320
 And just drinking water won't help

1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:54.600
 because you need electrolytes.

1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:57.760
 The other thing that's been shown over and over again,

1:44:57.760 --> 1:44:59.900
 numerous well-controlled studies

1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:03.320
 to improve muscle performance is creatine.

1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:06.120
 Early on, there was a lot of controversy about creatine,

1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:07.600
 but there are many studies.

1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:09.500
 If you want, you can go to this website

1:45:09.500 --> 1:45:10.880
 that everyone now knows I love,

1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:13.860
 which is this free website, examine.com,

1:45:13.860 --> 1:45:18.860
 that there are no fewer than 18 studies there, 66 studies.

1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:22.240
 So 18 studies supporting that muscle creatine content

1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:24.240
 can be increased by ingesting creatine.

1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:25.200
 How much creatine?

1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:28.400
 Well, I asked the experts and they tell me

1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:31.760
 that for somebody who's about 180 pounds,

1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:35.140
 five grams a day should be sufficient or so.

1:45:35.140 --> 1:45:36.840
 Heavier than 180, so if you've got like,

1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:39.700
 if you're a 220-pound or 230-pound person,

1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:41.580
 10 to 15 grams of creatine,

1:45:41.580 --> 1:45:43.060
 people lighter than 180 pounds,

1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:45.000
 maybe three to five grams of protein,

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.320
 excuse me, creatine, or even one to three grams.

1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:52.320
 Creatine is a fuel source for early in bouts of activity,

1:45:53.320 --> 1:45:54.760
 for high-intensity activity.

1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:57.920
 It is also a fuel source for neurons in the brain

1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:01.560
 and it can have some cognitive-enhancing effects.

1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:03.320
 So creatine is a very interesting molecule.

1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:06.200
 Early on, when it was released as a supplement,

1:46:06.200 --> 1:46:09.560
 it was thought that you had to load it

1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:11.120
 in higher dosages for a few days

1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:14.160
 and then maintain it at lower dosages.

1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:16.000
 So you'd take 20 or 30 grams a day,

1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:17.880
 then back off to five or 10.

1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:19.000
 It doesn't seem to be the case

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:19.960
 that you can get all the benefits

1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:22.920
 from taking the dosages at the low level.

1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:24.920
 I just mentioned a few moments ago

1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:26.960
 as they relate to body weight throughout.

1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:30.260
 So salt and electrolytes, absolutely key.

1:46:30.260 --> 1:46:31.100
 You need those present.

1:46:31.100 --> 1:46:32.600
 You need to be well-hydrated.

1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:36.560
 Creatine seems to have a performance-enhancing effect.

1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:39.360
 There are 66 studies, 66,

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:42.880
 showing that power output is greatly increased,

1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:46.200
 anywhere from 12 to 20%.

1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:48.120
 And this is sprinting and running and jumping

1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:50.660
 as well as weightlifting by creatine.

1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:55.080
 The ability to hydrate your body is improved by creatine

1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:58.120
 because of the way that it brings more water

1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:00.400
 into cells of various kinds.

1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:03.600
 As an indirect effect, it can help increase lean mass

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:05.600
 because of the way that it brings more water into muscle

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:07.160
 and probably also because of the way

1:47:07.160 --> 1:47:09.860
 that if you get stronger, you can generate more force

1:47:09.860 --> 1:47:11.540
 and generate more hypertrophy.

1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:13.020
 It reduces fatigue.

1:47:13.020 --> 1:47:15.600
 Seven studies have shown that it reduces fatigue.

1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:18.500
 There are even some interesting effects

1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:20.640
 on improving cognition after traumatic brain injury.

1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:23.040
 Although that's a serious medical condition in situations,

1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:25.860
 you absolutely should talk to a board-certified physician

1:47:25.860 --> 1:47:28.560
 before adding anything or taking anything

1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:30.960
 out of your current regimen.

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:31.840
 There are a few other effects

1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:34.440
 that are interesting and notable,

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:36.600
 but the big ones are the ones that I referred to before

1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:39.080
 about increased power output, et cetera.

1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:40.920
 And I just want to emphasize

1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:43.220
 that creatine can increase this hormone

1:47:43.220 --> 1:47:45.080
 that we talked about in the testosterone episode,

1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:48.640
 dihydrotestosterone, which is testosterone

1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:52.660
 converted by 5-alpha reductase into dihydrotestosterone.

1:47:52.660 --> 1:47:56.200
 It's the more dominant androgen in humans,

1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:59.240
 leads to increases in strength and libido and so forth.

1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:01.640
 It also can increase male pattern baldness.

1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:03.720
 Some people, not everybody,

1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:05.660
 experience some hair loss with creatine.

1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:06.500
 Other people don't.

1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:08.560
 Some people experience accelerated beard growth

1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:11.440
 because basically DHE has the opposite effect

1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:13.880
 on hair follicles on the face as it does on the scalp.

1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:15.380
 Some people don't.

1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:18.560
 Women who ingest creatine,

1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.280
 there are essentially no data showing

1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:23.880
 that it increases hair loss or facial hair growth,

1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:25.520
 but of course everyone is different.

1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:26.960
 So you can go to examine.com.

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:28.380
 You can explore those studies.

1:48:28.380 --> 1:48:30.520
 So creatine definitely a powerful

1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:32.240
 performance enhancing molecule.

1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:35.100
 The other one, one that personally I've never tried,

1:48:35.100 --> 1:48:37.800
 but that seems to have a very strong

1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:41.180
 and well-supported effects is beta-alanine.

1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:43.560
 Now, beta-alanine is interesting

1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:45.160
 because when you hear about weight training,

1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:47.160
 you think about heavy deadlifts and bench presses,

1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:49.080
 all that kind of stuff that people are doing,

1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:53.000
 but beta-alanine seems to support exercises

1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.040
 that is of slightly longer duration.

1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.960
 So a mix of anaerobic and aerobic type movement.

1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:01.680
 So things, these are physical performance

1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:04.300
 in the 60 to 240 second range.

1:49:04.300 --> 1:49:06.800
 So you can use your mind and kind of figure out

1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:09.240
 like things that weights of the,

1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:11.940
 that limit you to eight to 15 repetitions.

1:49:11.940 --> 1:49:16.080
 Cardiovascular exercise of the sort like rowing or sprinting.

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:18.900
 So interval work, it seems to help with that kind of work.

1:49:18.900 --> 1:49:20.060
 So we're not talking about long runs.

1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:21.840
 We're not talking about heavy deadlifts.

1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:24.200
 The standard dose is somewhere between two and five grams.

1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:26.340
 Again, as always check with a doctor,

1:49:26.340 --> 1:49:28.260
 make sure these things are safe for you.

1:49:28.260 --> 1:49:29.520
 I'm not responsible for your health.

1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:31.440
 You are, I don't say that just to protect me.

1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:34.240
 I'd say that also to protect you,

1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:38.120
 but it really seems to improve muscular endurance,

1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:41.940
 improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.

1:49:41.940 --> 1:49:43.040
 There are even some interesting effects

1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:45.960
 on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass.

1:49:45.960 --> 1:49:49.320
 So creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes,

1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:51.920
 these are kind of the core three things

1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:54.800
 that seem to improve performance and are well supported

1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.880
 by the scientific literature.

1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.720
 And in the earlier episode on supercharging performance,

1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:01.180
 we talked about palmar cooling.

1:50:01.180 --> 1:50:03.860
 That's certainly a performance enhancing tool.

1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:04.720
 It's nothing you ingest.

1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:06.960
 You're cooling your palms in a very specific way.

1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:07.920
 That's very powerful.

1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:10.420
 Now, what about for longer duration bouts of exercise?

1:50:10.420 --> 1:50:12.600
 We've mainly been focusing on resistance training,

1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:14.900
 but what about for long runs, long swims,

1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:16.040
 these kinds of things?

1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:19.280
 Well, it does seem that beet juice and ingesting things

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:22.480
 like arginine and citrulline can improve performance

1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:25.280
 for those long bouts of exercise.

1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:27.360
 That's mainly going to be due to effects

1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:29.680
 of those compounds on vasodilation.

1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:31.280
 It's going to open up the vasculature

1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:33.700
 and allow more blood flow.

1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:36.200
 Do note that things like citrulline and arginine

1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:39.920
 can have some side effects, if you will.

1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:42.080
 They can increase the likelihood

1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:45.820
 of having herpes cold sore outbreaks on the mouth.

1:50:45.820 --> 1:50:48.360
 The arginine is in the pathway by which,

1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:49.200
 I don't know if people know this,

1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:51.360
 but the herpes virus lives on neurons

1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:54.080
 of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the lips

1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:57.560
 and the eyes and the mucus membranes of the face.

1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:00.040
 So this is the herpes type one simplex virus.

1:51:00.040 --> 1:51:03.280
 The virus lives on those neurons

1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:05.880
 and then periodically inflames those neurons

1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:07.080
 and that's what leads to the cold sore.

1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:09.480
 It seems like arginine and citrulline

1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:13.600
 can lead to increases in cold sores and canker sores

1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:15.640
 and outbreaks of those kinds.

1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:17.440
 So you want to be aware of that.

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:22.440
 That's not everybody, and not everybody is carrying HSV-1.

1:51:23.780 --> 1:51:28.340
 Just be aware that I think it's now 80 or 90% of people.

1:51:28.340 --> 1:51:30.100
 By the time they are 12 years old,

1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:31.820
 they've contracted HSV-1.

1:51:31.820 --> 1:51:35.060
 It's very contagious and typically people will get

1:51:35.060 --> 1:51:37.900
 one outbreak and then only under conditions of stress

1:51:37.900 --> 1:51:39.900
 or heightened arginine or citrulline ingestion,

1:51:39.900 --> 1:51:41.380
 we'll have them later.

1:51:41.380 --> 1:51:46.380
 Again, this is not necessarily a sexually an STI.

1:51:46.380 --> 1:51:49.820
 This is a sexually transmitted infection.

1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:52.820
 This is an infection that is passed very easily

1:51:52.820 --> 1:51:55.100
 from mucus membranes, just in terms of touching objects

1:51:55.100 --> 1:51:56.100
 and things of that sort.

1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:58.980
 Very common in the general population.

1:51:58.980 --> 1:52:03.160
 Any discussion about muscle and muscle performance

1:52:03.160 --> 1:52:05.300
 would not be adequate if we didn't mention something

1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:07.820
 about nutrition, but rather than have a whole discussion

1:52:07.820 --> 1:52:09.640
 about nutrition, because there's lots of information

1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:11.020
 about that online.

1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:12.740
 Like for instance, if you want to gain muscle

1:52:12.740 --> 1:52:15.180
 that you need to have a caloric surplus

1:52:15.180 --> 1:52:19.180
 of about 10 to 15%, you could have a caloric surplus

1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:22.140
 of more if you want to avoid gaining weight,

1:52:22.140 --> 1:52:24.700
 then you would not create a caloric surplus, et cetera.

1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:26.260
 You can find all that information online.

1:52:26.260 --> 1:52:28.740
 That's not what this podcast is really about.

1:52:28.740 --> 1:52:32.180
 We had a month where we talked a lot about hormones

1:52:32.180 --> 1:52:33.380
 and food and moods.

1:52:33.380 --> 1:52:35.660
 We talked about foods, but more as they relate

1:52:35.660 --> 1:52:36.780
 to the nervous system.

1:52:36.780 --> 1:52:40.100
 When it comes to supporting muscle,

1:52:40.100 --> 1:52:43.340
 to supporting the synthesis of larger,

1:52:43.340 --> 1:52:45.280
 what I call myosin balloons,

1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:50.080
 it does seem that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams

1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:52.340
 of the essential amino acid leucine

1:52:52.340 --> 1:52:53.620
 with each meal is important.

1:52:53.620 --> 1:52:56.840
 Now that does not necessarily mean from supplements.

1:52:56.840 --> 1:53:01.620
 In fact, most people recommend that you get your protein,

1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:04.520
 you get your amino acids, including your essential amino

1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.620
 acids and your leucine from whole foods.

1:53:06.620 --> 1:53:10.220
 High quality proteins, high density proteins.

1:53:10.220 --> 1:53:11.060
 What do you mean by that?

1:53:11.060 --> 1:53:14.200
 Well, it is true that a lot of sources of protein

1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:17.060
 are found in things like beans and nuts

1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:19.060
 and things like that, that all the essential amino acids

1:53:19.060 --> 1:53:20.780
 can be found there.

1:53:20.780 --> 1:53:25.440
 But per unit calorie, if it's in your practice,

1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:28.100
 if it's in your ethics to ingest animal proteins,

1:53:28.100 --> 1:53:32.180
 it's true that for instance, 200 calories of steak

1:53:32.180 --> 1:53:35.840
 or chicken or fish or eggs will have a higher density

1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:38.240
 of essential amino acids than the equivalent amount

1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:40.840
 of calories from nuts or plants.

1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:42.500
 That's just simply the way it works.

1:53:42.500 --> 1:53:44.280
 So I'm not, for the vegans and vegetarians,

1:53:44.280 --> 1:53:46.480
 I'm certainly not saying there's no way

1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:48.140
 that you can support muscle growth.

1:53:48.140 --> 1:53:49.380
 You absolutely can.

1:53:49.380 --> 1:53:51.700
 Some of them might want to supplement leucine,

1:53:51.700 --> 1:53:55.900
 but this 700 to 3000 milligrams of leucine per meal

1:53:55.900 --> 1:53:57.800
 is one of the best ways that's been shown

1:53:57.800 --> 1:54:00.960
 to support the synthesis of more myosin

1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:02.900
 if your goal is hypertrophy.

1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:05.700
 And it's also the way that you would support muscle repair

1:54:05.700 --> 1:54:07.300
 if your goal is strength.

1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:10.020
 So that's specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy

1:54:10.020 --> 1:54:10.940
 and strength.

1:54:10.940 --> 1:54:12.620
 And I encourage you to think about

1:54:12.620 --> 1:54:15.380
 this protein density issue

1:54:15.380 --> 1:54:19.460
 and whether or not you ingest animal proteins

1:54:19.460 --> 1:54:21.940
 or you don't to think about whether or not

1:54:21.940 --> 1:54:25.580
 you're getting sufficient essential amino acids,

1:54:25.580 --> 1:54:27.000
 especially leucine.

1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:30.420
 Now, many people have addressed the question

1:54:30.420 --> 1:54:33.380
 of whether or not you need to eat six or seven times a day.

1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:34.580
 It turns out that you don't.

1:54:34.580 --> 1:54:35.920
 That's kind of the old school thinking

1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:37.340
 that you need to eat very frequently.

1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:40.580
 I think for certain athletes who are very active

1:54:40.580 --> 1:54:41.900
 for drug assisted,

1:54:41.900 --> 1:54:44.380
 meaning people that are enhancing their testosterone levels

1:54:44.380 --> 1:54:45.780
 to super physiological levels

1:54:45.780 --> 1:54:48.040
 where they are experiencing very heightened levels

1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:50.340
 of protein synthesis and they can utilize all that,

1:54:50.340 --> 1:54:51.220
 that might make sense.

1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:52.620
 Again, I'm not supporting the use

1:54:52.620 --> 1:54:54.220
 of those performance enhancing drugs,

1:54:54.220 --> 1:54:55.500
 but there are people doing that.

1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:59.000
 And that's one of the reasons why they eat so frequently

1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:00.340
 and so much protein.

1:55:00.340 --> 1:55:02.200
 For typical people who are not doing that,

1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.300
 I imagine most of you are not,

1:55:04.300 --> 1:55:08.000
 then it does appear that you need to eat,

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.380
 but you don't need to eat six or seven times a day.

1:55:10.380 --> 1:55:13.200
 It does seem like not eating once a day is also important.

1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:16.300
 So somewhere between one meal a day and six meals a day

1:55:16.300 --> 1:55:18.260
 lies the more reasonable two or three

1:55:18.260 --> 1:55:20.520
 or maybe four times a day.

1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:23.820
 I think that a whole discussion about this is warranted

1:55:23.820 --> 1:55:25.940
 and we'll have this discussion with Dr. Galpin

1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:29.600
 at a future time of whether or not eating protein

1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:33.020
 more frequently can enhance this myosin synthesis.

1:55:33.020 --> 1:55:35.380
 But I think the simple takeaway from the literature

1:55:35.380 --> 1:55:37.700
 that I was able to extract and from my discussion

1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:39.960
 with him is eating two to four times a day,

1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:42.980
 making sure you're getting sufficient amino acids

1:55:42.980 --> 1:55:45.100
 in a way that's compatible with your ethics

1:55:45.100 --> 1:55:46.660
 and with your nutritional regimen

1:55:46.660 --> 1:55:50.460
 is going to support muscle repair, muscle growth,

1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:53.520
 strength improvements, et cetera, just fine.

1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:55.640
 There's one more thing that I'd like to cover,

1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:58.160
 which is the relationship between particular kinds

1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:00.660
 of exercise and our ability to think

1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:03.480
 and perform cognitive functions.

1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:06.680
 We all hear that exercise is so vital for our brain

1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:08.620
 that it supports our brain health and our body health.

1:56:08.620 --> 1:56:12.380
 And indeed that's true provided it's done correctly.

1:56:12.380 --> 1:56:16.020
 However, many of us are familiar with the experience

1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:18.220
 of going for a run or going for a swim

1:56:18.220 --> 1:56:19.780
 or working out hard in the gym

1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:21.620
 and then not being able to use our brain

1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:24.240
 to be essentially useless for cognitive functions

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:26.220
 for the rest of the day.

1:56:26.220 --> 1:56:29.420
 I discussed this with Dr. Galpin this morning

1:56:29.420 --> 1:56:30.780
 and I learned something very interesting,

1:56:30.780 --> 1:56:33.700
 which is that hard bouts of exercise

1:56:33.700 --> 1:56:35.740
 of the sort where you're training near failure

1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:39.580
 or you're generating focused muscular contractions

1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:42.340
 for obsession that lasts anywhere from,

1:56:42.340 --> 1:56:44.940
 I don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes

1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:46.860
 or a long run where you're engaging

1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:49.540
 in some interval training during that run.

1:56:49.540 --> 1:56:52.440
 After exercise, there's a reduction

1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:54.340
 in oxygenation of the brain.

1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:56.140
 So there's actually a quite significant dip

1:56:56.140 --> 1:56:58.600
 in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting

1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:00.420
 and therefore your ability to think.

1:57:00.420 --> 1:57:03.060
 So it's important that you control the intensity

1:57:03.060 --> 1:57:05.040
 and the duration of your training sessions

1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:07.600
 so that you're still able to do well in life

1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:09.900
 and lean into life the way you need to,

1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:12.580
 because I'm guessing most of you are not in a position

1:57:12.580 --> 1:57:14.340
 to just prioritize your physical training.

1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:16.740
 You also need to use your minds.

1:57:16.740 --> 1:57:19.060
 I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise

1:57:19.060 --> 1:57:20.460
 but also the requirement of needing

1:57:20.460 --> 1:57:23.580
 to perform cognitive work throughout the day.

1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:27.220
 It also turns out that you can leverage something

1:57:27.220 --> 1:57:30.480
 interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work

1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:33.900
 in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus.

1:57:33.900 --> 1:57:36.300
 And it has to do with the way that your body

1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:38.540
 and your nervous system predict bouts

1:57:38.540 --> 1:57:40.320
 of intense focused effort.

1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:42.640
 So let's say you're doing resistance training two

1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:44.740
 or three times a week, maybe even four times a week,

1:57:44.740 --> 1:57:47.240
 and you're doing it consistently at a given time.

1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:51.800
 There are clocks, literally biological clocks

1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:54.020
 within the liver and within the brain

1:57:54.020 --> 1:57:57.920
 that learn to predict that focus and that intense work.

1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:02.800
 If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done,

1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:06.420
 you might try scheduling that cognitive work

1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:09.320
 on the days when you don't do physical training

1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:11.580
 at the same time when you normally would do

1:58:11.580 --> 1:58:14.700
 that intense focused physical training.

1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:16.520
 Because the systems of the body

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:18.140
 that generate acetylcholine release

1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:20.580
 and other neuromodulators, the systems of the body

1:58:20.580 --> 1:58:22.680
 and brain that generate focused effort,

1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:26.200
 those are on this sort of clock mechanism

1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:28.760
 in a way that you likely will find

1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:31.120
 that after just a week of training at regular times,

1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:34.740
 you will be able to focus readily on other things

1:58:34.740 --> 1:58:35.960
 when you're not training,

1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:38.960
 provided you do it during the period of time of day

1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:40.880
 when you normally would train.

1:58:40.880 --> 1:58:43.400
 So this is kind of an indirect positive effect.

1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:46.360
 You're harnessing the focus and the expectation of focus

1:58:46.360 --> 1:58:48.920
 in your nervous system for that particular time of day.

1:58:48.920 --> 1:58:50.720
 And of course, we'd be remiss

1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:53.200
 if we didn't talk about time of day for training.

1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:56.760
 Turns out that whether or not you train in the morning

1:58:56.760 --> 1:58:59.420
 or in the afternoon, it doesn't really seem to matter

1:58:59.420 --> 1:59:02.760
 for sake of things like hypertrophy and strength, et cetera.

1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:04.160
 Everyone seems to have a time of day

1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:05.980
 that they prefer to train.

1:59:05.980 --> 1:59:07.800
 I've said before, and there are reasons

1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:12.260
 based on body temperature rhythms and cortisol release

1:59:12.260 --> 1:59:16.520
 that training 30 minutes, three hours or 11 hours

1:59:16.520 --> 1:59:18.960
 after your normal waking time can be very beneficial

1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:21.840
 and can provide a sort of predictability or regularity

1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:25.280
 to when your body will be ready to train

1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:27.800
 and best apt to train well.

1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:30.080
 There is some evidence that training in the afternoon

1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:31.400
 is better for performance,

1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:33.920
 whereas training for body composition changes

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:35.600
 and strength changes, et cetera,

1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:37.120
 doesn't really matter when you train.

1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:38.880
 So you also want to make it compatible with sleep,

1:59:38.880 --> 1:59:39.960
 compatible with work.

1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:42.560
 That really gets down into the weeds of optimization.

1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:44.080
 But I think it's interesting to note

1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:47.160
 that if you're going to train at a regular time,

1:59:47.160 --> 1:59:50.240
 you can take the days when you don't train

1:59:50.240 --> 1:59:52.880
 and use that to enhance your cognitive focus

1:59:52.880 --> 1:59:55.360
 for things that have nothing to do with exercise.

1:59:55.360 --> 1:59:57.480
 So this might be writing or reading or music or math,

1:59:57.480 --> 1:59:58.720
 et cetera.

1:59:58.720 --> 2:00:01.280
 Typically, I restrict these podcast episodes

2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:02.680
 to about 90 minutes,

2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.620
 so-called ultradian cycle for learning.

2:00:04.620 --> 2:00:06.240
 Today was a bit longer,

2:00:06.240 --> 2:00:09.560
 and I admit that I tried to pack a lot into this.

2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:11.720
 It is the last episode in this month

2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:12.840
 on physical performance.

2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:15.360
 I figured in this case, more is better,

2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:18.200
 especially since everything is timestamped for you.

2:00:18.200 --> 2:00:20.440
 You certainly don't have to watch it all at once,

2:00:20.440 --> 2:00:22.480
 and you can come back to it over and over again

2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:25.160
 into the precise locations in the episode that you like

2:00:25.160 --> 2:00:26.680
 in order to take notes

2:00:26.680 --> 2:00:29.240
 or extract the information that you need.

2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:32.780
 I'd like to point you to Dr. Andy Galpin's page.

2:00:32.780 --> 2:00:36.140
 I highly recommend looking into the work that he's doing

2:00:36.140 --> 2:00:37.720
 if you want more details.

2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:40.320
 He's very, very skilled, excellent communicator.

2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:41.480
 He's superb at what he does.

2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:42.320
 He's a professor.

2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:43.320
 He works with athletes.

2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:45.680
 He works with typical folks in the exercise

2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:47.320
 and muscle physiology world.

2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:48.400
 Brad Schoenfield's work,

2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:49.600
 I also have a lot of respect for.

2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:50.420
 I've never met him.

2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:51.260
 I don't know him.

2:00:51.260 --> 2:00:52.520
 There's no paid endorsement here.

2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:55.240
 They're not sponsors or related to the podcast in any way.

2:00:55.240 --> 2:00:57.760
 I just think the work is of very high quality,

2:00:57.760 --> 2:00:59.240
 and they are both on the academic side

2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:00.360
 and the practical side,

2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:02.760
 and of course, there are other people out there

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:04.960
 doing fabulous work in this area as well.

2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:08.080
 If you like this podcast and you're benefiting

2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:09.640
 from the information that you're learning

2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:11.040
 and you want to support us,

2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:13.200
 the simplest and most straightforward way to do that

2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:16.560
 is a zero cost way, which is to subscribe to, excuse me,

2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:18.880
 subscribe to the podcast on YouTube,

2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:20.680
 click the subscribe button,

2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:23.840
 and to subscribe on Apple and Spotify as well.

2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:24.780
 That really helps us.

2:01:24.780 --> 2:01:26.720
 It helps us get the message about the podcast out

2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:28.320
 more broadly generally,

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:30.920
 and it ensures that you don't miss any episodes.

2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:32.880
 We release episodes every Monday,

2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:35.320
 but starting soon and from time to time,

2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:37.760
 we release shorter episodes in between.

2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:40.300
 So you're sure to hear about those episodes.

2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:41.840
 In addition, check out the sponsors

2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:44.340
 that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

2:01:44.340 --> 2:01:45.840
 If you like, and if you're able to,

2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:47.520
 supporting us through those sponsors

2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:49.480
 is a terrific way to support our production staff

2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:51.400
 and the podcast generally.

2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:53.160
 A zero cost way to support the podcast

2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:55.020
 is to tell your friends, tell your neighbors,

2:01:55.020 --> 2:01:56.200
 tell anyone that you think

2:01:56.200 --> 2:01:57.800
 might benefit from the information.

2:01:57.800 --> 2:01:59.840
 The way this podcast is set up,

2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:03.480
 the information is batched into four or five episodes,

2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:06.080
 all centered around a given theme or topic,

2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:07.840
 like hormones, like sleep.

2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:09.480
 So the episodes on sleep, for instance,

2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:11.920
 that were way back in January,

2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:13.420
 or what seems like way back,

2:02:13.420 --> 2:02:15.640
 are still every bit as relevant today

2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:17.520
 as they were back in January

2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:19.560
 for somebody that has challenges with sleep

2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:21.680
 and wants to understand sleep and get better at sleep

2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:23.000
 or wants to understand their dreams

2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.160
 or how to use sleep and dreaming

2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:27.920
 to leverage neuroplasticity and learning.

2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:30.180
 So if you pass information along about the podcast,

2:02:30.180 --> 2:02:31.020
 that's great.

2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:31.920
 We also have a Patreon.

2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:35.320
 You can go to patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:36.840
 There, you can support the podcast

2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:38.800
 at any level that you like.

2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:41.880
 And as always, please put your questions

2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:44.760
 about the podcast episodes and suggestions

2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:46.820
 for future episodes in the comment section.

2:02:46.820 --> 2:02:49.480
 I really do read through all those comments.

2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:51.480
 It takes me some time, but I do read through those.

2:02:51.480 --> 2:02:54.580
 I reply to as many of them as I can, but I do read them.

2:02:54.580 --> 2:02:56.920
 And they're a great way for us to get feedback.

2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.960
 On Apple, you can give us a five-star review

2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:00.640
 if you think we deserve that.

2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:02.880
 And if you want to do all these things, you're welcome to.

2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:05.220
 If you want to do just one of them, we understand.

2:03:05.220 --> 2:03:06.380
 And if you do none of them,

2:03:06.380 --> 2:03:08.020
 we still appreciate that you come here

2:03:08.020 --> 2:03:09.200
 to digest the information

2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:11.540
 about science and science-related tools.

2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:14.980
 In today's episode, I mentioned various supplements,

2:03:14.980 --> 2:03:19.480
 various compounds that if you deem it right and safe for you

2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:21.660
 can benefit athletic performance

2:03:21.660 --> 2:03:24.720
 and muscle physiology, et cetera.

2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:27.480
 We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:28.960
 because Thorne supplements,

2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:31.560
 we believe are of the highest possible stringency

2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:32.580
 and quality.

2:03:32.580 --> 2:03:34.960
 What you see on the bottle is what's in the bottle.

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:37.200
 And the quality of ingredients that they include

2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:38.480
 are excellent.

2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:40.680
 So much so that they partnered with the Mayo Clinic

2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:42.420
 and all the major sports teams.

2:03:42.420 --> 2:03:45.960
 If you go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com

2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:48.580
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:03:48.580 --> 2:03:50.520
 you can see all the supplements that I take

2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:53.140

 as well as 20% off any of the other supplements

2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:07.340
