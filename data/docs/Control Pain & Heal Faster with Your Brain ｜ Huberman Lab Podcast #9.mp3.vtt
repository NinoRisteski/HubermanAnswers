00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.120
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.120 --> 00:15.800
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.640
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.640 --> 00:19.480
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.620
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.620 --> 00:23.800
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.800 --> 00:25.920
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.920 --> 00:27.360
 to the general public.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.720
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.720 --> 00:31.620
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.960
 Our first sponsor is ExpressVPN.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.600
 ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

00:36.600 --> 00:39.380
 that keeps your data secure by routing your data

00:39.380 --> 00:42.080
 and online activities through their servers

00:42.080 --> 00:44.360
 and keeping your data safe and secure,

00:44.360 --> 00:47.680
 but also not selling your data to third parties.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.240
 I started using ExpressVPN because unfortunately,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.580
 I had my bank accounts hacked.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.880
 I was traveling a lot,

00:54.880 --> 00:58.840
 and I typically go on hotel or airline

00:58.840 --> 01:02.500
 or other public wifi from time to time.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.680
 And I don't know how it happened,

01:04.680 --> 01:07.360
 but somehow my information got out there.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.480
 And as I learned more from my friends

01:09.480 --> 01:12.760
 and people that work in the tech community,

01:12.760 --> 01:15.600
 turns out that many networks are not secure.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.520
 So with ExpressVPN, it keeps all your information secure.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.120
 It keeps information about your password secure.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.060
 It keeps information about the websites that you visit

01:25.060 --> 01:27.720
 secure, and as I mentioned earlier,

01:27.720 --> 01:30.360
 they never give away or sell your data.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.680
 The nice thing is you can use ExpressVPN.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.000
 It runs in the background,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.060
 and you don't even really realize that it's on.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.280
 It works on your phone.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.760
 It works on your laptop.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.720
 It even works on your smart TV.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.660
 If you'd like to try ExpressVPN,

01:42.660 --> 01:46.660
 you can go to expressvpn.com slash Huberman

01:46.660 --> 01:49.860
 to get three months free on their one-year program.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.080
 I love ExpressVPN.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.320
 I use it even when I'm at home.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.360
 And so if you wanna try it,

01:54.360 --> 01:57.880
 you can go to expressvpn.com slash Huberman,

01:57.880 --> 02:00.720
 and you'll get three months free on their one-year program.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.040
 The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.380
 Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

02:07.380 --> 02:10.280
 I started taking Athletic Greens in 2012

02:10.280 --> 02:13.340
 because I wanted to cover my vitamin and mineral bases.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.840
 I didn't know which things to take.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.840
 I found it really dizzying to know which vitamins

02:16.840 --> 02:18.320
 and minerals to purchase.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.340
 And Athletic Greens allowed me to get all the things

02:20.340 --> 02:23.680
 I needed to cover my bases in one easy-to-consume formula

02:23.680 --> 02:25.480
 that also happens to taste really good.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.740
 I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.280
 The probiotics in Athletic Greens

02:30.280 --> 02:31.560
 are also really important to me

02:31.560 --> 02:33.980
 because now there's an abundance of data

02:33.980 --> 02:35.840
 showing that the gut microbiome,

02:35.840 --> 02:37.760
 which is supported by probiotics,

02:37.760 --> 02:40.120
 is important for gut-brain axis,

02:40.120 --> 02:43.000
 mood, metabolic function, hormone function,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.120
 just a huge number of biological functions

02:46.120 --> 02:47.880
 and health parameters.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.400
 If you wanna try Athletic Greens,

02:49.400 --> 02:52.720
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.640
 And if you do that,

02:53.640 --> 02:57.180
 they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

02:57.180 --> 02:59.680
 Vitamin D3 also has a lot of support

02:59.680 --> 03:00.960
 from the scientific literature

03:00.960 --> 03:04.520
 showing that it's important for immune function.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.320
 So if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

03:07.320 --> 03:08.640
 you'll get Athletic Greens

03:08.640 --> 03:11.020
 plus the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

03:11.020 --> 03:14.200
 And they'll give you five free travel packets.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.040
 Mixing up powders is a little bit messy sometimes

03:17.040 --> 03:17.860
 when you're on the road.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.880
 You're in the car, you're on the plane,

03:19.880 --> 03:21.360
 or you're on the move.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.240
 These travel packets make everything really clean

03:23.240 --> 03:24.400
 and really easy.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.480
 Once again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:27.480 --> 03:30.400
 for Athletic Greens, the five free travel packets,

03:30.400 --> 03:33.200
 and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.760
 Many of you have graciously asked

03:34.760 --> 03:37.880
 how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.720
 There are several ways that you can do that.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.820
 One is to check out our sponsors.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.280
 The other is we've set up a Patreon account.

03:44.280 --> 03:47.640
 You can go to patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.720
 And that allows you to donate to the podcast

03:49.720 --> 03:52.160
 at a variety of different levels.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.020
 In addition, if you could subscribe

03:54.020 --> 03:56.920
 to the podcast on YouTube, that's terrific.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.160
 If you haven't done that already, please do so.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.400
 And please leave a comment.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.840
 If you want to make suggestions about future episodes,

04:03.840 --> 04:06.400
 please also put that in the comment section.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.700
 If you subscribe on Apple or Spotify or both,

04:09.700 --> 04:10.760
 that helps us.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.180
 And as well, Apple gives you the opportunity

04:13.180 --> 04:16.460
 to leave a review and give us a five-star rating

04:16.460 --> 04:19.040
 if you feel we deserve a five-star rating.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.600
 And of course, please recommend the podcast

04:21.600 --> 04:23.640
 to your friends, to your family members,

04:23.640 --> 04:26.440
 anyone that you think would benefit from the information.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.960
 So really the answer to your question

04:27.960 --> 04:29.820
 of how you can support the podcast is

04:29.820 --> 04:31.200
 you don't have to buy products,

04:31.200 --> 04:32.880
 although checking all the sponsors does help.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.160
 You don't have to donate to Patreon.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.440
 We, of course, can't require you to subscribe

04:38.440 --> 04:40.640
 and fill out reviews and things of that sort.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.740
 But we like to think that we're providing

04:42.740 --> 04:45.520
 a number of different ways to support the podcast,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.600
 some of which are zero cost, some of which, if you like,

04:48.600 --> 04:51.680
 gives you the opportunity to contribute financially.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.240
 That's terrific as well.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.240
 So thank you so much.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.560
 We really appreciate your interest

04:55.560 --> 04:57.740
 in helping us keep this coming your way.

04:57.740 --> 04:58.580
 Thank you.

04:58.580 --> 05:02.500
 Let's continue our discussion about neuroplasticity,

05:02.500 --> 05:04.400
 this incredible feature of our nervous system

05:04.400 --> 05:06.280
 that allows it to change itself

05:06.280 --> 05:09.260
 in response to experience and even in ways

05:09.260 --> 05:13.160
 that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.660
 That's an incredible feature.

05:14.660 --> 05:17.720
 No other organ in our body has that capability.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.800
 Our nervous system, which governs everything

05:19.800 --> 05:22.420
 about who we are, how we feel, and what we do,

05:22.420 --> 05:24.400
 does have that capability.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.040
 The issue is most people don't know

05:26.040 --> 05:28.400
 how to access neuroplasticity.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.760
 Children readily access neuroplasticity

05:30.760 --> 05:32.960
 and they don't even realize that they're doing it.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.080
 Adults want neuroplasticity.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.040
 And so that's what this entire month

05:37.040 --> 05:39.200
 of the Huberman Lab podcast has been about.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.220
 We've explored neuroplasticity

05:41.220 --> 05:43.920
 from a variety of different perspectives.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.920
 We talked about representational plasticity.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.640
 We talked about the importance of focus and reward.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.000
 We talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect

05:52.000 --> 05:53.600
 of the vestibular system,

05:53.600 --> 05:57.380
 how altering our relationship to gravity.

05:57.380 --> 06:01.100
 And in addition to that, making errors as we try and learn

06:01.100 --> 06:03.320
 can open up windows to plasticity.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.280
 But we have not really talked so much

06:06.280 --> 06:09.440
 about directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes.

06:09.440 --> 06:13.680
 And thus far, we really haven't talked yet

06:13.680 --> 06:18.000
 about how to undo things that we don't want.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.280
 I've talked about learning and I say learn a language,

06:20.280 --> 06:24.320
 learn free throws, learn a particular motor skill, et cetera.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.240
 But what about what we would call unlearning

06:26.240 --> 06:29.960
 or about removing some aspect of our experience

06:29.960 --> 06:31.000
 that we don't want?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.440
 And so today we are going to explore

06:33.440 --> 06:35.600
 that aspect of neuroplasticity

06:35.600 --> 06:38.500
 and we are going to do that in the context

06:38.500 --> 06:41.960
 of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic,

06:41.960 --> 06:45.320
 which is pain regeneration,

06:45.320 --> 06:48.480
 and in some cases injury to the nervous system.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.760
 Now, for those of you that are fortunate enough

06:50.760 --> 06:55.760
 to not have or had a concussion or not have

06:56.160 --> 06:59.720
 or know someone who's experiencing chronic or acute pain,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.360
 I encourage you to stay in here with us

07:01.360 --> 07:04.740
 because a lot of the information that we are going to cover

07:04.740 --> 07:09.740
 has direct relevance to neuroplasticity for other purposes.

07:09.740 --> 07:13.120
 We, as always here on this podcast,

07:13.120 --> 07:14.920
 are going to discuss some of the science,

07:14.920 --> 07:16.600
 we get into mechanism,

07:16.600 --> 07:20.740
 but we also really get at principles.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.480
 Principles are far more important than any one experiment

07:24.480 --> 07:26.100
 or one description of mechanism,

07:26.100 --> 07:29.180
 and certainly far more important than any one protocol

07:29.180 --> 07:31.080
 because principles allow you to think

07:31.080 --> 07:33.280
 about your nervous system and work with it

07:33.280 --> 07:35.020
 in ways that best serve you.

07:35.020 --> 07:38.600
 They are very flexible batches of information.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.180
 So we are going to talk about the principles

07:41.180 --> 07:44.240
 of neuroplasticity for removing pain

07:44.240 --> 07:45.960
 and wound healing and injury.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.360
 We're going to talk about acupuncture of all things.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.660
 We are going to talk about modern medicine's attempt

07:52.660 --> 07:55.840
 to try and restore youth to the aging

07:55.840 --> 07:59.440
 or injured or demented brain.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.940
 And we are going to definitely talk about tools.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.960
 Got a lot of tools.

08:03.960 --> 08:08.280
 I consulted a number of fantastic colleagues at Stanford,

08:08.280 --> 08:09.600
 at Harvard Medical School,

08:09.600 --> 08:13.360
 and in the greater community of tissue rehabilitation,

08:13.360 --> 08:16.480
 injury and pain management in preparation for this podcast.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.480
 I do want to be very clear and just remind you

08:20.480 --> 08:22.280
 that I'm not a medical doctor.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.680
 I'm a professor, so I don't prescribe anything.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.960
 I profess things.

08:25.960 --> 08:26.980
 I have my beliefs,

08:26.980 --> 08:29.500
 but the podcast is for information purposes.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.600
 I do hope that the tools that we discuss

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
 will be of benefit to you.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.440
 But as always, you should talk to your doctor

08:37.440 --> 08:39.760
 or healthcare provider about any tools

08:39.760 --> 08:42.640
 that you plan to add or are looking to explore,

08:42.640 --> 08:45.280
 as well as anything that you might look to remove

08:45.280 --> 08:46.560
 from your daily protocols.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.840
 In other words, don't change anything

08:47.840 --> 08:49.920
 without consulting an expert first.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.200
 You're responsible for your health, not me.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.480
 And I say this not just to protect me,

08:54.480 --> 08:56.800
 but also to protect you.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.440
 So please keep that in mind as we move forward.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.700
 And I'm very excited to share with you this information

09:02.700 --> 09:05.100
 because I do feel that it can be of great benefit

09:05.100 --> 09:06.360
 to a number of people.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.840
 So let's start our discussion about pain and sensation

09:10.840 --> 09:13.160
 and regeneration and wound healing

09:13.160 --> 09:16.060
 with a discussion about a very important system

09:16.060 --> 09:16.900
 in the nervous system,

09:16.900 --> 09:19.280
 which is the somatosensory system.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.840
 The somatosensory system is, as the name implies,

09:22.840 --> 09:26.120
 involved in understanding touch,

09:26.120 --> 09:28.600
 physical feeling on our body.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.200
 And the simplest way to think about

09:30.200 --> 09:33.940
 the somatosensory system is that we have little sensors,

09:33.940 --> 09:36.160
 and those sensors come in the form of neurons,

09:36.160 --> 09:38.640
 nerve cells, that reside in our skin

09:38.640 --> 09:40.700
 and in the deeper layers below the skin.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.880
 And indeed we do.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.360
 We have some that correspond to,

09:45.360 --> 09:48.980
 and we should say respond to mechanical touch.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.880
 So, you know, pressure on the top of my hand

09:51.880 --> 09:55.700
 or a pinpoint or other sensors, for instance,

09:55.700 --> 09:58.000
 respond to heat, to cold.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.900
 Some respond to vibration.

10:00.900 --> 10:04.600
 We have a huge number of different receptors in our skin

10:04.600 --> 10:07.200
 and they take that information

10:07.200 --> 10:10.420
 and send it down these wires that we call axons

10:10.420 --> 10:12.080
 in the form of electrical signals

10:12.080 --> 10:14.360
 to our spinal cord and then up to the brain.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.900
 And within the spinal cord and brain,

10:16.900 --> 10:19.760
 we have centers that interpret that information,

10:19.760 --> 10:21.920
 that actually makes sense of those electrical signals.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.800
 And this is amazing because none of those sensors

10:25.800 --> 10:29.100
 has a different unique form of information that it uses.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.800
 It just sends electrical potentials into the nervous system.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.600
 So the nervous system, you somehow decode

10:35.600 --> 10:38.300
 what a given stimulus on your skin is.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.240
 So maybe it's the wind blowing gently

10:41.240 --> 10:44.100
 and deflecting some of the hairs on your arm,

10:44.100 --> 10:48.480
 or maybe it's a sharp pinprick or a hot stove

10:48.480 --> 10:51.120
 or the warmth of a glowing fire.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.440
 That all arrives in your nervous system

10:53.440 --> 10:55.680
 in the form of these electrical things

10:55.680 --> 10:57.820
 we call action potentials, which is just amazing.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.280
 And then the brain computes them and makes sense of them.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.720
 So we have peripheral sensors

11:03.720 --> 11:05.880
 and we've got stations up in our brain

11:05.880 --> 11:07.080
 and within our spinal cord

11:07.080 --> 11:10.080
 that makes sense of all the stuff coming in.

11:10.080 --> 11:14.960
 Pain and the sensation of pain is, believe it or not,

11:14.960 --> 11:17.960
 a controversial word in the neuroscience field.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.760
 People prefer to use the word nociception.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.080
 Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin

11:24.080 --> 11:27.600
 that detect particular types of stimuli.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.600
 It actually comes from the Latin word nocera,

11:29.600 --> 11:30.920
 which means to harm.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.440
 And why would neuroscientists not want to talk about pain?

11:33.440 --> 11:35.240
 Well, it's very subjective.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.780
 It has a mental component and a physical component.

11:38.780 --> 11:42.880
 We cannot say that pain is simply an attempt

11:42.880 --> 11:45.640
 to avoid physical harm to the body.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.100
 And here's why.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.080
 They actually can be dissociated from one another.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.460
 A good example would be if, God forbid,

11:53.460 --> 11:55.940
 you were exposed to high levels of radiation,

11:57.160 --> 11:59.440
 such as working with some sort of material

11:59.440 --> 12:02.020
 that was radioactive or, you know,

12:02.020 --> 12:04.040
 you were near a former radioactive plant

12:04.040 --> 12:07.580
 or some radiation, excessive x-rays, et cetera,

12:07.580 --> 12:09.980
 you wouldn't feel any pain during the x-rays.

12:09.980 --> 12:10.820
 In fact, you don't.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.920
 If you've ever had x-rays, as I have,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.380
 you don't feel anything.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.920
 They put you under that lead blanket,

12:15.920 --> 12:17.240
 they run behind a wall, and then they,

12:17.240 --> 12:19.280
 in my case, they take these pictures of your teeth

12:19.280 --> 12:21.580
 and it's really scary because you go,

12:21.580 --> 12:23.240
 something really terrible must be happening here,

12:23.240 --> 12:25.040
 but you don't feel anything.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.740
 But there can be a lot of tissue damage.

12:27.740 --> 12:31.040
 There can be mutations introduced to cells, et cetera.

12:31.040 --> 12:31.880
 I've had x-rays.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.200
 I'm not saying people shouldn't have x-rays,

12:33.200 --> 12:35.040
 but excessive x-rays certainly are not good

12:35.040 --> 12:36.520
 for human beings.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.240
 Likewise, with excessive exposure to any radiation.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.960
 So there can be tissue damage

12:40.960 --> 12:43.720
 without the physical perception

12:43.720 --> 12:46.840
 or mental perception of pain at all.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.140
 As well, there can be the belief of pain

12:50.140 --> 12:52.800
 or the feeling of pain without there being tissue damage.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.460
 And there's a famous case that was published

12:55.460 --> 12:57.540
 in the British Journal of Medicine

12:57.540 --> 13:00.160
 where a construction worker,

13:00.160 --> 13:03.420
 I think he fell is how the story went,

13:03.420 --> 13:08.420
 and a 14 inch nail went through his boot

13:08.840 --> 13:09.960
 and up through the boot.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.000
 And he was in excruciating pain,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.240
 just beyond anything he'd experienced.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.560
 He reported that he couldn't even move in any dimension,

13:18.560 --> 13:21.480
 even a tiny bit without feeling excruciating pain.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.540
 They brought him into the clinic, into the hospital.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.240
 They were able to cut away the boot

13:26.240 --> 13:29.940
 and they realized that the nail had gone between two toes

13:29.940 --> 13:33.200
 and it had actually not impaled the skin at all.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.340
 His visual image of the nail going through his boot

13:37.340 --> 13:41.280
 gave him the feeling, the legitimate feeling,

13:41.280 --> 13:43.800
 that he was experiencing the pain of a nail

13:43.800 --> 13:44.720
 going through his foot,

13:44.720 --> 13:47.240
 which is incredible because it speaks to the power

13:47.240 --> 13:50.440
 of the mind in this pain scenario.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.000
 And it also speaks to the power of the specificity.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.040
 It's not like he thought that his foot was on fire.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.200
 He thought because he saw a nail going through his foot,

13:59.200 --> 14:01.060
 what it was going through his boot,

14:01.060 --> 14:02.920
 but he thought it was going through his foot,

14:02.920 --> 14:05.760
 that it was sharp pain of the sort

14:05.760 --> 14:07.440
 that a nail would produce.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.740
 And there are thousands of these kinds

14:09.740 --> 14:11.640
 of case reports out there.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.240
 Now that is not to say that all pain that we experience

14:14.240 --> 14:15.720
 is in our head,

14:15.720 --> 14:18.420
 but it really speaks to the incredible capacity

14:18.420 --> 14:19.940
 that these top-down,

14:19.940 --> 14:22.880
 these higher level cognitive functions have

14:22.880 --> 14:25.040
 in interpreting what we're experiencing

14:25.040 --> 14:26.040
 out in the periphery,

14:26.040 --> 14:28.580
 even just on the basis of what we see.

14:28.580 --> 14:31.740
 And the example of radiation speaks to the fact

14:31.740 --> 14:34.600
 that pain and tissue damage are dissociable

14:34.600 --> 14:36.340
 from one another, okay?

14:36.340 --> 14:38.340
 So why are we talking about pain

14:38.340 --> 14:41.460
 during a month on neuroplasticity?

14:41.460 --> 14:44.240
 Well, it turns out that the pain system offers us

14:44.240 --> 14:47.160
 a number of different principles that we can leverage

14:47.160 --> 14:51.040
 to A, ensure that if we are ever injured,

14:51.040 --> 14:52.640
 we are able to understand the difference

14:52.640 --> 14:55.880
 between injury and pain, because there is a difference,

14:55.880 --> 14:57.120
 that if we're ever in pain,

14:57.120 --> 14:58.340
 that we can understand the difference

14:58.340 --> 15:00.760
 between injury and pain,

15:00.760 --> 15:02.900
 that we will be able to interpret our pain.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.880
 And during the course of today's podcast,

15:04.880 --> 15:08.880
 I'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain

15:08.880 --> 15:11.000
 from both ends of the spectrum,

15:11.000 --> 15:14.300
 from the periphery at the level of the injury,

15:14.300 --> 15:17.840
 and through these top-down mental mechanisms.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.320
 A lot of times on this podcast,

15:19.320 --> 15:22.460
 in fact, mostly I tend to center on the physiology,

15:22.460 --> 15:26.180
 on the really objective things that you can describe

15:26.180 --> 15:28.300
 and talk about diaphragmatic movement or sunlight

15:28.300 --> 15:30.260
 of a particular number of photons, et cetera.

15:30.260 --> 15:33.160
 But today's a really exciting opportunity

15:33.160 --> 15:35.320
 for us to discuss some of the more subjective things.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.760
 Believe it or not, we're going to talk about love.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.920
 A colleague of mine at Stanford,

15:39.920 --> 15:42.060
 who runs a major pain clinic,

15:43.040 --> 15:47.820
 is working on and has published quality peer review data

15:47.820 --> 15:52.360
 on the role of love in modulating the pain response.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.280
 Only there's a twist to it,

15:54.280 --> 15:55.620
 and I'm not going to reveal it just yet,

15:55.620 --> 15:59.760
 but it turns out that the specific type of connection

15:59.760 --> 16:03.720
 one has to a romantic partner actually dictates

16:03.720 --> 16:05.640
 whether or not their love for them

16:05.640 --> 16:07.440
 will alleviate physical pain.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.320
 And the effects are really robust.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.760
 It's an amazing literature.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.200
 And so what we're talking about today

16:12.200 --> 16:14.640
 is plasticity of perception,

16:14.640 --> 16:18.880
 which has direct bearing on emotional pain

16:18.880 --> 16:20.860
 and has direct bearing on trauma.

16:20.860 --> 16:23.020
 And other things that we've discussed in previous episodes

16:23.020 --> 16:25.800
 a little bit, but that we're going to explore even more

16:25.800 --> 16:28.680
 in an entire month about those topics.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.360
 So let's get started in thinking about

16:31.360 --> 16:34.040
 what happens with pain.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.920
 And I will describe some examples

16:36.920 --> 16:39.080
 of some kind of extreme cases.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.440
 For instance, I will tell you just now

16:41.440 --> 16:43.680
 that there is a mutation, a genetic mutation,

16:43.680 --> 16:45.120
 in a particular sodium channel.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.360
 A sodium channel is one of these little holes in neurons

16:48.360 --> 16:50.300
 that allows them to fire action potentials.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.680
 It's important to the function of the neuron.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.500
 It's also important for the development of certain neurons.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.300
 And there's a particular mutation.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.900
 There are kids that are born without this sodium channel 1.7

16:59.900 --> 17:01.220
 if you want to look it up.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.740
 Those kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever.

17:04.740 --> 17:07.120
 And it is a terrible situation.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.000
 They burn themselves.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.520
 They tend to rest on their limbs too long.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.520
 They don't make the micro adjustments.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.880
 You might see me swiveling around in my chair,

17:14.880 --> 17:15.740
 moving around a lot.

17:15.740 --> 17:18.160
 Those micro adjustments are actually normal,

17:18.160 --> 17:20.440
 healthy micro adjustments that prevent us

17:20.440 --> 17:21.280
 from going into pain.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.400
 They don't make those adjustments.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.920
 They don't get the feedback

17:23.920 --> 17:25.360
 that they're in a particular position.

17:25.360 --> 17:26.860
 And so they never make those adjustments

17:26.860 --> 17:30.940
 and their joints get destroyed essentially.

17:30.940 --> 17:33.180
 They don't tend to live very long due to accidents.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.860
 It's a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance.

17:35.860 --> 17:39.040
 Some people have a mutation in the same channel

17:39.040 --> 17:40.600
 where they make too much of this channel

17:40.600 --> 17:41.720
 so they feel too much pain.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.220
 In fact, it's reasonable to speculate

17:45.220 --> 17:46.640
 that one of the reasons, not all,

17:46.640 --> 17:48.840
 but one of the reasons why people might differ

17:48.840 --> 17:52.560
 in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation

17:52.560 --> 17:56.760
 in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.440
 People who make too much of this receptor

17:59.440 --> 18:02.960
 experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.200
 Now, the good news is there are good drug treatments

18:06.200 --> 18:10.640
 that can block specifically this sodium channel 1.7.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.800
 And so those people get a lot of relief

18:12.800 --> 18:14.560
 from taking such drugs.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.720
 So pain and how much pain we are sensitive to

18:18.720 --> 18:21.720
 or insensitive to probably has some genetic basis.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.360
 And then of course, there are things that we can do

18:24.360 --> 18:26.920
 to make sure that we experience less pain,

18:26.920 --> 18:29.280
 although pain has this adaptive role.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.720
 So let's talk about some of the features

18:31.720 --> 18:35.740
 of how we're built physically and how that relates to pain

18:35.740 --> 18:38.020
 and how we can recover from injury.

18:38.020 --> 18:43.020
 So first of all, we have maps of our body surface

18:43.280 --> 18:44.120
 in our brain.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.920
 It's called a homunculus.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.920
 In a rat, believe it or not, I'm not making this up,

18:48.920 --> 18:50.420
 it's called a ratunculus.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.960
 In Costello, my dog is snoring behind me.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.600
 It's a dogunculus.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.920
 I could get into the nomenclature and why it's called this,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.680
 but it's basically a representation of the body surface.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.840
 That representation is scaled

19:03.840 --> 19:06.720
 in a way that matches sensitivity.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.720
 So the areas of your body that are most sensitive

19:09.720 --> 19:12.680
 have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.220
 Your back is an enormous piece of tissue

19:15.220 --> 19:16.880
 compared to your fingertip,

19:16.880 --> 19:19.640
 but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it

19:19.640 --> 19:21.640
 and the representation of your back in your brain

19:21.640 --> 19:23.560
 is actually pretty small,

19:23.560 --> 19:26.680
 whereas the representation of your finger is enormous.

19:26.680 --> 19:31.680
 So how big a brain area is devoted to a given body part

19:32.800 --> 19:35.980
 is directly related to the density of receptors

19:35.980 --> 19:38.120
 in that body part, not the size of the body part.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.680
 And that's why if we were to draw your homunculus

19:40.680 --> 19:42.840
 or Costello's dogunculus,

19:42.840 --> 19:45.880
 what we would find is that certain areas like the lips,

19:45.880 --> 19:48.260
 like the fingertips, like the genitalia,

19:48.260 --> 19:51.080
 like the eyes and the area around the face

19:51.080 --> 19:53.240
 would have a huge representation.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.800
 Whereas the back, the torso and areas of the body

19:55.800 --> 19:57.580
 that are less sensitive

19:57.580 --> 19:59.920
 are going to have smaller representation.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.940
 So it'd be a very distorted map.

20:01.940 --> 20:06.940
 You can actually know how sensitive a given body part is

20:07.500 --> 20:10.600
 and how much brain area is devoted to it

20:10.600 --> 20:12.720
 through what's called two-point discrimination.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.960
 You can do this experiment if you want.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.620
 I think I've described this once or twice before,

20:15.620 --> 20:18.960
 but basically if you have someone put,

20:18.960 --> 20:23.440
 maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart

20:23.440 --> 20:26.560
 on your back and touch while you're facing away

20:26.560 --> 20:29.840
 and they'll ask you how many points they're touching you

20:29.840 --> 20:31.880
 and you say two,

20:31.880 --> 20:34.320
 but if they move those closer together, say three inches,

20:34.320 --> 20:37.680
 you're likely to experience it as one point of contact.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.040
 Whereas on your finger,

20:39.040 --> 20:41.320
 you could play that game all day

20:41.320 --> 20:44.480
 and as long as there's a millimeter or so spacing,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.760
 you will know that it's two points as opposed to one

20:46.760 --> 20:48.200
 and that's because there's more pixels,

20:48.200 --> 20:50.560
 more density of receptors.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.360
 This has direct bearing to pain

20:52.360 --> 20:54.280
 because it says that areas of the body

20:54.280 --> 20:55.360
 that have denser receptors

20:55.360 --> 20:58.640
 are going to be more sensitive to pain than to others.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.500
 And where we have more receptors,

21:01.500 --> 21:05.480
 we tend to have more blood vessels and glia,

21:05.480 --> 21:07.000
 which are these support cells

21:07.000 --> 21:10.360
 and other cells that lend to the inflammation response

21:10.360 --> 21:12.000
 and that's really important.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.280
 So just as a rule of thumb,

21:14.280 --> 21:17.280
 areas of your body that are injured that are large areas

21:17.280 --> 21:19.840
 that have low sensitivity before injury

21:19.840 --> 21:23.120
 likely are going to experience less pain

21:23.120 --> 21:28.120
 and the literature shows will heal more slowly

21:28.240 --> 21:31.040
 because they don't have as many cells around

21:31.040 --> 21:32.520
 to produce inflammation.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.160
 And you might say, wait, I thought inflammation is bad.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.220
 Well, one of the things I really want to get across today

21:37.220 --> 21:40.120
 is that inflammation is not bad.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.960
 Inflammation out of control is bad,

21:41.960 --> 21:43.860
 but inflammation is wonderful.

21:43.860 --> 21:46.680
 Inflammation is the tissue repair response

21:46.680 --> 21:49.920
 and we are going to talk about subjective and objective ways

21:49.920 --> 21:53.260
 to modulate inflammation after tissue injury,

21:53.260 --> 21:56.660
 even after just exercise that's been too intense.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.520
 Okay, so you have this map of your body surface,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.740
 it's sensitive in different ways, now you know why.

22:01.740 --> 22:05.800
 So you've got your neurobiology of somatic sensation 101

22:05.800 --> 22:07.320
 under your belt now.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.440
 We didn't cover everything,

22:08.440 --> 22:10.620
 but we'll touch on some of the other details

22:10.620 --> 22:12.080
 as we go forward.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.800
 I thought it might be a nice time to just think about

22:14.800 --> 22:17.160
 the relationship between the periphery and the central maps

22:17.160 --> 22:19.220
 in a way that many of you have probably heard about before,

22:19.220 --> 22:22.520
 which will frame the discussion a little bit better,

22:22.520 --> 22:24.760
 which is phantom limb pain.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.300
 Now, some of you are probably familiar with this,

22:26.300 --> 22:31.300
 but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger

22:31.740 --> 22:35.080
 or some other portion of their body amputated,

22:35.080 --> 22:38.000
 it's not uncommon for those people to feel

22:38.000 --> 22:40.520
 as if they still have that limb or appendage

22:40.520 --> 22:42.620
 or piece of their body intact.

22:42.620 --> 22:47.120
 And typically, unfortunately, the sensation of that limb

22:47.120 --> 22:49.780
 is not one of the limb being nice and relaxed

22:49.780 --> 22:52.360
 and just there.

22:52.360 --> 22:56.600
 The sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain

22:56.600 --> 23:00.000
 or is contorted in the specific orientation that it was

23:00.000 --> 23:01.440
 around the time of the injury.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.480
 So if someone has a blunt force to the hand

23:04.480 --> 23:06.320
 and they end up having their hand amputated,

23:06.320 --> 23:08.760
 typically they will continue to feel pain

23:08.760 --> 23:11.800
 in their phantom hand, which is pretty wild.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.840
 And that's because the representation of that hand

23:14.840 --> 23:18.200
 is still intact in the cortex, in the brain,

23:18.200 --> 23:21.220
 and it's trying to balance its levels of activity.

23:21.220 --> 23:22.640
 Normally, it's getting what's called

23:22.640 --> 23:24.180
 proprioceptive feedback.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.080
 Proprioception is just our knowledge

23:26.080 --> 23:27.600
 of where our limbs are in space.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.440
 It's an extremely important aspect

23:29.440 --> 23:31.640
 of our somatosensory system.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.600
 And there's no proprioceptive feedback.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
 And so a lot of the circuits start to ramp up

23:36.600 --> 23:39.520
 their levels of activity and they become very conscious

23:39.520 --> 23:41.200
 of the phantom limb.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.560
 Now, before my lab was at Stanford, I was at UC San Diego.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.640
 And one of my colleagues was a guy,

23:46.640 --> 23:49.520
 everyone just calls him by his last name, Ramachandran,

23:49.520 --> 23:52.880
 who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon

23:52.880 --> 23:54.240
 and developing a very simple,

23:54.240 --> 23:56.520
 but very powerful solution to it

23:56.520 --> 23:59.940
 that speaks to the incredible capacity

23:59.940 --> 24:01.600
 of top-down modulation.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.640
 And top-down modulation, the ability to use one's brain,

24:04.640 --> 24:07.960
 cognition, and senses to control pain in the body

24:07.960 --> 24:09.520
 is something that everyone,

24:09.520 --> 24:12.160
 not just people missing limbs or in chronic pain

24:12.160 --> 24:14.000
 can learn to benefit from because it is a way

24:14.000 --> 24:18.080
 to tap into our ability to use our mind

24:18.080 --> 24:22.280
 to control perceptions of what's happening in our body.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.760
 And this is not a mystical statement.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.440
 This is not about mind, I guess, as much as his brain

24:27.440 --> 24:29.120
 to control our perceptions of our body.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.080
 So what did Ramachandran do?

24:32.080 --> 24:37.080
 Ramachandran had people who were missing a limb

24:37.640 --> 24:42.520
 put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it

24:42.520 --> 24:44.400
 such that when they looked in the box

24:44.400 --> 24:47.160
 and they moved their intact limb,

24:47.160 --> 24:51.260
 the opposite limb, which was a reflection of the intact limb

24:51.260 --> 24:52.960
 because they're missing the opposite limb,

24:52.960 --> 24:55.920
 they would see it as if it was intact.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.000
 And as they would move their intact limb,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.680
 they would visualize with their eyes

25:01.920 --> 25:05.360
 the limb that's in the place of the absent limb,

25:05.360 --> 25:06.840
 so this is all by mirrors,

25:06.840 --> 25:10.480
 moving around and they would feel immediate relief

25:10.480 --> 25:13.040
 from the phantom pain.

25:13.040 --> 25:16.060
 And he would tell them and they would direct their hand

25:16.060 --> 25:20.360
 toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.120
 Then they would exit the mirror box,

25:22.120 --> 25:24.720
 they would take their hand out

25:24.720 --> 25:27.800
 and they would feel as if the hand was now

25:27.800 --> 25:29.380
 in its relaxed normal position.

25:29.380 --> 25:32.160
 So you could get real time in moments

25:32.160 --> 25:35.040
 remapping of the representation of the hand.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.140
 Now that's amazing.

25:36.140 --> 25:37.440
 This is the kind of thing that all of us

25:37.440 --> 25:39.880
 would like to be able to do if we are in pain.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.760
 If you stub your toe, if you break your ankle,

25:41.760 --> 25:43.640
 if you take a hard fall on your bike,

25:43.640 --> 25:45.440
 or if you're in chronic pain,

25:45.440 --> 25:50.440
 wouldn't it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick,

25:50.480 --> 25:51.880
 but it's not a trick, right?

25:51.880 --> 25:54.100
 Because it's real visual imagery

25:54.100 --> 25:57.820
 to remap your representation of your body surface

25:57.820 --> 25:59.220
 and where your body is.

25:59.220 --> 26:02.500
 That is something that we could all benefit from

26:02.500 --> 26:05.960
 because if you do anything for long enough, including live,

26:05.960 --> 26:08.120
 you're going to experience pain of some sort.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.960
 And this, again, I just want to remind you,

26:09.960 --> 26:12.560
 isn't just about physical injuries and pain,

26:12.560 --> 26:16.120
 this has direct relevance to emotional pain as well,

26:16.120 --> 26:18.560
 which we, of course, we'll talk about.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.280
 So the Ramachandran studies were really profound

26:21.280 --> 26:22.520
 because they said a couple of things.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.200
 One, plasticity can be very fast,

26:25.200 --> 26:28.880
 that it can be driven by the experience of something,

26:28.880 --> 26:29.940
 just the visual experience.

26:29.940 --> 26:32.440
 He had people do this mirror box thing,

26:32.440 --> 26:34.120
 but not look into the mirror box

26:34.120 --> 26:35.400
 and they didn't get the remapping.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.900
 So it required visual imagery coming in.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.120
 We also know, for instance,

26:41.120 --> 26:45.680
 that in cases like where people are congenitally deaf,

26:46.700 --> 26:50.360
 the cochlear implant, which is simply a way of putting,

26:50.360 --> 26:53.240
 it's not simple, but it's a way of putting in a device

26:53.240 --> 26:54.720
 that replaces the cochlea,

26:54.720 --> 26:58.400
 the device that we're normally born with,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.520
 in the ear that has these little,

27:00.520 --> 27:01.360
 what are called hair cells

27:01.360 --> 27:02.840
 that deflect according to sound waves

27:02.840 --> 27:04.280
 and allow us to hear

27:04.280 --> 27:07.440
 by replacing the normal hearing apparatus

27:07.440 --> 27:09.800
 that's deficient in deaf people

27:09.800 --> 27:12.040
 with this cochlear implant,

27:12.040 --> 27:15.760
 the brain can make sense of this artificial ear, basically.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.280
 It's not the outside ear, not the pinna,

27:17.280 --> 27:21.620
 but the inner ear, and they can start to hear sounds.

27:21.620 --> 27:26.620
 Now, some people really like the artificial cochlea.

27:26.820 --> 27:28.580
 They really benefit from it.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.920
 It restores their ability to hear and they like it.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.960
 Other people don't.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.420
 Some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.000
 can be very disruptive to them.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.760
 And some of that might have to do with

27:38.760 --> 27:39.920
 the need for further,

27:39.920 --> 27:42.440
 better engineering of these artificial cochleas.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.680
 But all this really speaks to the fact

27:44.680 --> 27:47.840
 that the brain is an adaptive device.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.140
 It will respond to what you give it.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.040
 It is not a device that is fixed.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.640
 In fact, the essence of the brain,

27:53.640 --> 27:54.920
 especially the human brain,

27:54.920 --> 27:59.320
 is to take sensory inputs and to make sense of those,

27:59.320 --> 28:01.000
 meaning cognitive sense,

28:01.000 --> 28:02.720
 and then to interpret those signals.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.160
 And so this may come as a shock to some of you,

28:05.160 --> 28:07.100
 and by no means am I trying to be insensitive,

28:07.100 --> 28:10.000
 but pain is a perceptual thing

28:10.000 --> 28:11.920
 as much as it's a physical thing.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.560
 It's a belief system

28:13.560 --> 28:15.480
 about what you're experiencing in your body.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.220
 And that has important relevance

28:17.220 --> 28:19.080
 for healing different types of injury

28:19.080 --> 28:21.620
 and the pain associated with that injury.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.260
 In people's pursuit for neuroplasticity,

28:24.260 --> 28:26.820
 a question that comes up every once in a while

28:26.820 --> 28:28.260
 is people will say,

28:28.260 --> 28:30.800
 if I just brush my teeth with the opposite hand

28:30.800 --> 28:34.160
 for a couple nights in a row, will I get neuroplasticity?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.280
 And the answer is probably yes.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.600
 I mean, it's a deliberate action.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.520
 You're focusing on it.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.360
 There's an end goal.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.760
 You're very likely to make errors

28:40.760 --> 28:43.500
 like dropping an anterior lip and gums at first

28:43.500 --> 28:44.560
 and then getting better at it.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.200
 And as you heard in last episode,

28:46.200 --> 28:48.100
 making errors is really important

28:48.100 --> 28:49.740
 because those errors are the signal

28:49.740 --> 28:51.360
 that plasticity needs to happen.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.200
 And then when you get the actions correct,

28:54.200 --> 28:56.440
 then those correct actions are programmed in.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.200
 I'm not sure that brushing one's teeth

29:00.200 --> 29:04.080
 with the opposite hand is the most effective use

29:04.080 --> 29:05.780
 of this incredible thing that we have,

29:05.780 --> 29:06.640
 which is plasticity.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.480
 It's not going to open up plasticity for many other things.

29:09.480 --> 29:13.340
 So if that were really important to you for whatever reason,

29:13.340 --> 29:14.880
 maybe you have a crowded bathroom

29:14.880 --> 29:17.140
 and it's easier to do on one side or the other, then fine.

29:17.140 --> 29:18.240
 But it's kind of hard to imagine

29:18.240 --> 29:20.680
 why this would be a highly adaptive behavior,

29:20.680 --> 29:22.160
 unless of course you have an injured limb

29:22.160 --> 29:23.280
 or you're missing a limb.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.480
 And that gets me to some really exciting

29:25.480 --> 29:28.000
 and important studies that were performed

29:28.000 --> 29:31.180
 mostly in the 90s, as well as in the 2000s.

29:31.180 --> 29:34.340
 And that for now there is really a solid base of data.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.960
 There's really a center of mass

29:35.960 --> 29:39.280
 around a particular set of experiments

29:39.280 --> 29:41.640
 that point to particular protocols

29:41.640 --> 29:44.920
 for how to overcome motor injury.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.720
 And this may resonate with some of you

29:46.720 --> 29:48.320
 who've ever been injured to the point

29:48.320 --> 29:51.720
 where you couldn't walk well temporarily,

29:51.720 --> 29:53.720
 I hope, or even longer.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.200
 So think about a sprained ankle scenario

29:56.200 --> 29:58.040
 or a broken arm scenario.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.240
 We're all familiar with the stories

30:01.240 --> 30:04.160
 of people having a cast on and then getting the cast off.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.840
 And that the particular limb that wasn't being used

30:06.840 --> 30:10.140
 that was casted is much smaller and atrophied.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.380
 Most of that atrophy, you might be surprised to learn,

30:13.380 --> 30:15.980
 is not because the muscles aren't being used.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.020
 It's because the nerves sending signals to those muscles

30:19.020 --> 30:20.360
 are not active.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.600
 And therefore the muscles aren't contracting.

30:24.580 --> 30:26.840
 Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert

30:27.840 --> 30:30.160
 and his graduate students and postdocs,

30:30.160 --> 30:33.600
 Teresa Jones and others, in the 90s and 2000s,

30:33.600 --> 30:36.180
 showed something really wonderful

30:36.180 --> 30:38.120
 that I think we can all benefit from

30:38.120 --> 30:39.420
 should we have an injury,

30:39.420 --> 30:43.420
 and even if we simply want to balance out imbalances

30:43.420 --> 30:44.880
 in our motor activity.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.480
 And I think all of us tend to be stronger

30:47.480 --> 30:49.000
 on one side or the other side.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.400
 Usually a right-handed person

30:51.400 --> 30:54.040
 will be stronger in their left arm,

30:54.040 --> 30:57.680
 not always, for compensatory reasons.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.240
 Some other time we can talk about handwriting.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.400
 The lefties likely will be stronger in their right arm,

31:02.400 --> 31:03.840
 although it kind of depends on whether or not

31:03.840 --> 31:05.280
 people are hook righties.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.220
 That's when you kind of hook around and right from the top

31:07.220 --> 31:08.540
 or hook lefties.

31:08.540 --> 31:09.840
 There are all sorts of theories about this

31:09.840 --> 31:11.000
 that we can talk about,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.780
 right brain, left brain, math proficiency, et cetera.

31:13.780 --> 31:16.440
 In any event, what Schallert and colleagues showed

31:16.440 --> 31:19.920
 was that if we have damage to our brain

31:20.920 --> 31:23.540
 in the sensory motor pathways,

31:23.540 --> 31:25.400
 any number of different sensory motor pathways,

31:25.400 --> 31:28.960
 or we have damage to a limb,

31:28.960 --> 31:31.400
 could be a leg, could be an arm, could be a hand,

31:31.400 --> 31:34.380
 there's great benefit

31:34.380 --> 31:38.160
 to restricting the use of the opposite,

31:38.160 --> 31:43.160
 better performing uninjured limb or hand

31:43.620 --> 31:45.880
 or other part of the body.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.420
 They had about a dozen papers showing

31:48.420 --> 31:50.420
 that if there was damage centrally in the brain,

31:50.420 --> 31:52.100
 or there was damage to a limb,

31:52.100 --> 31:55.220
 so unilateral damage, as we say, one side,

31:55.220 --> 32:00.220
 the thing to do is not to cast up the damaged side,

32:00.220 --> 32:02.820
 although you need to do that to protect the limb,

32:02.820 --> 32:04.100
 of course, from further damage.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.940
 So if it's a broken arm, you need to cast the arm

32:05.940 --> 32:07.560
 or you need to brace the arm,

32:07.560 --> 32:11.580
 but that the key thing was to restrict movement

32:11.580 --> 32:14.920
 of the intact uninjured opposite limb.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.940
 And when they did that,

32:16.940 --> 32:20.420
 it forced some movement in the injured limb

32:21.260 --> 32:24.300
 and remarkably through connections

32:24.300 --> 32:26.400
 from the two sides of the brain,

32:26.400 --> 32:27.500
 through the corpus callosum,

32:27.500 --> 32:28.780
 this huge fiber pathway

32:28.780 --> 32:30.700
 that links the two sides of the brain,

32:30.700 --> 32:34.060
 they saw plasticity on both sides of the brain.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.460
 So this makes sense when you hear it.

32:36.460 --> 32:39.620
 Let's say I injure my left ankle

32:39.620 --> 32:42.920
 and I'm limping along or I'm using crutches.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.400
 You would think, well, the last thing you want to do

32:44.400 --> 32:46.580
 is injure your opposite limb

32:46.580 --> 32:48.140
 or not use your opposite limb,

32:48.140 --> 32:49.980
 my right ankle is perfectly fine.

32:49.980 --> 32:53.080
 But if I lean too hard on my right limb

32:53.080 --> 32:55.860
 and I take all the work out of the left limb,

32:55.860 --> 32:57.420
 the left ankle,

32:57.420 --> 32:59.180
 that's actually setting up a situation

32:59.180 --> 33:01.240
 where there's going to be runaway asymmetry

33:01.240 --> 33:02.740
 in the central pathways

33:02.740 --> 33:06.460
 and the nerve to muscle pathways on my left side.

33:06.460 --> 33:07.780
 And so what they suggested

33:07.780 --> 33:10.720
 and what they showed in a variety of experiments

33:10.720 --> 33:14.420
 was that by encouraging activity of the injured limb

33:14.420 --> 33:16.660
 provided it could be done without pain

33:17.500 --> 33:21.420
 and importantly, not just exercising that limb

33:21.420 --> 33:22.240
 or part of the body,

33:22.240 --> 33:25.980
 but restricting the opposite healthy part of the body

33:25.980 --> 33:30.980
 that the speed of recovery was significantly faster.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.120
 Now I want to repeat,

33:32.120 --> 33:34.020
 you don't want to go injuring something further.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.140
 That's probably the worst thing you could do.

33:36.140 --> 33:39.260
 But in some cases where people have damage in their brain,

33:39.260 --> 33:40.660
 the limbs are perfectly fine,

33:40.660 --> 33:42.900
 but the motor signals aren't getting down to the limbs.

33:42.900 --> 33:45.380
 And in that case, the limb is fine.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.700
 So you actually are free

33:46.700 --> 33:49.800
 to use either limb as much as you want.

33:49.800 --> 33:50.640
 And in that case,

33:50.640 --> 33:53.400
 you don't want to rely on the uninjured pathway too much.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.200
 In fact, you want to restrict the uninjured pathway.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.420
 So I find these studies remarkable

33:58.420 --> 34:00.460
 and they've been followed up on at the molecular level,

34:00.460 --> 34:02.540
 at the cellular level many times.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.460
 And I think the physiotherapists out there

34:04.460 --> 34:07.120
 and the rest of you who are involved in sports medicine

34:07.120 --> 34:08.500
 and some of the physicians will say,

34:08.500 --> 34:10.100
 well, of course that makes perfect sense.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.940
 But oftentimes this is not what happens.

34:12.940 --> 34:15.460
 Oftentimes what happens is it's all about resting

34:15.460 --> 34:17.560
 and limiting inflammation, et cetera,

34:17.560 --> 34:19.460
 of the injured limb

34:19.460 --> 34:23.820
 or the limbs corresponding to the injured part of the brain.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.560
 And these experiments and the collection of them

34:27.560 --> 34:30.780
 point to the fact that the balance between the right

34:30.780 --> 34:33.340
 and left side of our body is always dynamic.

34:33.340 --> 34:36.100
 It's always being updated at the level of neural circuitry.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.940
 The Ramachandran studies with the mirror box

34:37.940 --> 34:39.020
 support that too.

34:39.020 --> 34:41.480
 And that even slight imbalances

34:41.480 --> 34:43.980
 in the two sides of the body can get amplified.

34:43.980 --> 34:46.700
 And so when you're in a situation where one side is injured

34:46.700 --> 34:49.240
 or the brain is injured representing one side of the body,

34:49.240 --> 34:52.620
 the key thing to do is to really overwork

34:52.620 --> 34:54.740
 the side that needs the work

34:54.740 --> 34:57.500
 and to restrict the activity of the side

34:57.500 --> 34:59.860
 that doesn't need the work because it's healthy.

34:59.860 --> 35:04.420
 And this has great semblance to ocular dominance plasticity

35:04.420 --> 35:06.360
 which I talked about a couple episodes ago.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.780
 I won't go into it in detail,

35:07.780 --> 35:10.760
 but where the Nobel prize winning neurobiologists

35:10.760 --> 35:12.240
 Torrance Wiesel and David Hubel showed

35:12.240 --> 35:15.440
 that if one eye is closed early in development,

35:15.440 --> 35:19.040
 that the representation of the opposite eye in the brain

35:19.040 --> 35:22.300
 is completely overtaken by the intact eye.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.620
 So this is important.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.500
 It means that all of our senses and our movements

35:27.500 --> 35:30.340
 are competing for space in our brain.

35:30.340 --> 35:32.640
 And so the way to think about the principle

35:32.640 --> 35:36.700
 is anytime you're injured and you're hobbling along,

35:36.700 --> 35:38.700
 you don't want to injure yourself further,

35:38.700 --> 35:41.460
 but you want to try and compensate

35:41.460 --> 35:44.820
 in the ways that respect this competition

35:44.820 --> 35:46.220
 for neural real estate.

35:46.220 --> 35:48.660
 And what that usually means is not relying

35:48.660 --> 35:50.780
 on where you're still strong

35:50.780 --> 35:53.260
 because that's just going to create runaway plasticity

35:53.260 --> 35:54.660
 that's going to make it very hard

35:54.660 --> 35:57.100
 for you to recover the motor function

35:57.100 --> 36:00.620
 and in some cases the sensory function of the damaged limb.

36:00.620 --> 36:03.300
 Some of you may be wondering how long

36:03.300 --> 36:05.820
 and how often one should restrict the activity

36:05.820 --> 36:10.820
 of the intact or healthy limb or limbs in some cases.

36:11.260 --> 36:13.100
 And the answer is you don't have to do that

36:13.100 --> 36:14.220
 all day every day.

36:14.220 --> 36:17.840
 These experiments centered on doing one or two hours

36:17.840 --> 36:21.080
 of dedicated work, sensory motor work,

36:21.080 --> 36:25.100
 or so for instance, if you had a sprained ankle on the left,

36:25.100 --> 36:28.220
 you might spend part of the day where your left leg,

36:28.220 --> 36:31.060
 provided it's not too painful, can be exercised,

36:31.940 --> 36:34.820
 again, in a way that's not damaging to the injury,

36:34.820 --> 36:37.700
 and the right limb can't contribute to that exercise.

36:37.700 --> 36:42.180
 So this might be pedaling unilaterally on a stationary bike.

36:42.180 --> 36:45.140
 If you can do that for a different type of limb injury,

36:45.140 --> 36:48.540
 like an arm injury, this might be reaching

36:48.540 --> 36:50.980
 provided the shoulder is mobile, doing reaching.

36:50.980 --> 36:54.860
 It might be even writing with the damaged side

36:54.860 --> 36:56.900
 and then intentionally not writing

36:56.900 --> 36:59.500
 with the preferred or undamaged side.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.580
 This has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity

37:03.580 --> 37:05.300
 and the recovery of function,

37:05.300 --> 37:07.400
 which I think is what most people want.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.180
 When people are injured, they want to get back

37:09.180 --> 37:10.980
 to doing what they were doing previously

37:10.980 --> 37:14.660
 and they want to be able to do that without pain.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.740
 Now, this brings up another topic,

37:16.740 --> 37:20.420
 which is definitely related to neuroplasticity and injury,

37:20.420 --> 37:23.820
 but is a more general one that I hear about a lot,

37:23.820 --> 37:25.260
 which is traumatic brain injury.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.780
 Many injuries are not just about the limb

37:27.780 --> 37:29.820
 and the lack of use of the limb,

37:29.820 --> 37:31.900
 but concussion and head injury.

37:31.900 --> 37:34.300
 And I want to emphasize, I'm not a neurologist.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.380
 I have many colleagues that are.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.740
 At some point, we will do a whole month on TBI

37:38.740 --> 37:40.500
 because it's such a serious issue

37:40.500 --> 37:43.160
 and it's such a huge discussion.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.340
 But I want to talk a little bit about what is known

37:46.340 --> 37:48.060
 about recovery from concussion.

37:48.060 --> 37:52.820
 And this is very important because it has implications

37:52.820 --> 37:54.500
 for just normal aging as well

37:54.500 --> 37:58.180
 and offset setting some of the cognitive decline

37:58.180 --> 38:01.520
 and physical decline that occurs with normal aging.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.980
 So we shouldn't think of TBI

38:02.980 --> 38:04.420
 as just for the football players

38:04.420 --> 38:06.040
 or just for the kids that had an injury

38:06.040 --> 38:07.740
 or just for the person that was in the car accident.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.060
 We want to learn about TBI

38:09.060 --> 38:11.060
 and understand TBI for those folks.

38:11.060 --> 38:14.180
 But we're also going to talk about TBI

38:14.180 --> 38:18.460
 as it relates to general degradation of brain function

38:18.460 --> 38:20.980
 because there's a certain semblance there

38:20.980 --> 38:23.860
 of TBI to general brain aging.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.060
 Typically after TBI,

38:25.060 --> 38:26.560
 there are a number of different things that happen

38:26.560 --> 38:30.020
 and there are a huge range of things that can create TBI.

38:30.980 --> 38:34.000
 Neurologists and the emergency room physicians

38:34.000 --> 38:35.080
 are going to want to know,

38:35.080 --> 38:38.900
 was the skull itself injured

38:38.900 --> 38:41.160
 or did the brain rattle around in the skull?

38:42.420 --> 38:45.260
 Was there actually a breach through the skull?

38:45.260 --> 38:47.560
 Is there a physical object in there?

38:47.560 --> 38:49.240
 How many concussions has the person had?

38:49.240 --> 38:51.300
 I mean, everyone's situation with TBI

38:51.300 --> 38:52.700
 is incredibly different,

38:52.700 --> 38:55.420
 but there's a constellation of symptoms that many people,

38:55.420 --> 38:57.100
 if not all people with TBI report,

38:57.100 --> 39:00.100
 which is headache, photophobia,

39:00.100 --> 39:01.900
 that lights become kind of aversive,

39:01.900 --> 39:04.280
 sleep disruption, trouble concentrating,

39:04.280 --> 39:06.680
 sometimes mood issues.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.940
 There's a huge range

39:07.940 --> 39:10.580
 and of course the severity will vary, et cetera.

39:11.660 --> 39:15.100
 In a previous episode, I mentioned the Kennard principle.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.880
 The Kennard principle, named after the famous neurologist,

39:18.880 --> 39:22.620
 named by and after the famous neurologist, Margaret Kennard,

39:22.620 --> 39:24.100
 said that if you're going to get a brain injury,

39:24.100 --> 39:26.180
 better to get it early in life than later in life

39:26.180 --> 39:28.060
 and that's because the brain has a much greater

39:28.060 --> 39:30.580
 or heightened capacity for repairing itself

39:30.580 --> 39:32.300
 early in life than later.

39:32.300 --> 39:34.280
 But of course, none of us want TBI

39:34.280 --> 39:36.220
 and you can't pick when you get your TBI.

39:36.220 --> 39:39.020
 You can avoid certain activities that would give you TBI,

39:39.020 --> 39:42.180
 but really when it comes to TBI,

39:42.180 --> 39:43.060
 there are a couple of things

39:43.060 --> 39:46.020
 that are agreed upon across the board.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.980
 The first one is as much as possible,

39:47.980 --> 39:51.020
 you want to avoid a second traumatic brain injury

39:51.020 --> 39:52.020
 or concussion.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.700
 Now that's going to be a tough one for some of the athletes

39:54.700 --> 39:57.440
 and even recreational athletes to swallow

39:57.440 --> 40:00.260
 because they want to continue in their sport

40:00.260 --> 40:02.740
 and I'm not here to tell you that you should or you shouldn't

40:02.740 --> 40:07.260
 but that's simply the way that it is.

40:07.260 --> 40:08.900
 For folks that are in military

40:08.900 --> 40:11.420
 or that are in certain professions,

40:11.420 --> 40:14.300
 construction is a place where we see a lot of TBI.

40:14.300 --> 40:15.620
 It's not always just football.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.020
 A lot of construction workers are dealing

40:17.020 --> 40:19.840
 with heavy objects swinging around in space.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.480
 They wear those hard hat helmets,

40:21.480 --> 40:23.340
 which unfortunately don't protect much

40:23.340 --> 40:25.980
 against a lot of those blunt forces

40:25.980 --> 40:28.500
 and certainly not against falls and things of that sort.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.340
 So many people in order to survive and feed their families

40:31.340 --> 40:33.420
 have to go back to work.

40:33.420 --> 40:36.140
 It's very clear that regardless of whether or not

40:36.140 --> 40:37.260
 there was a skull break

40:37.260 --> 40:39.500
 and regardless of when the TBI happened

40:39.500 --> 40:41.740
 or how many times it's happened,

40:41.740 --> 40:45.500
 that the system that repairs the brain, the adult brain,

40:46.360 --> 40:49.500
 is mainly centered around this lymphatic system

40:49.500 --> 40:53.000
 that we call for the brain, the glymphatic system.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.900
 Now the brain wasn't thought to have a lymphatic system.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.260
 It wasn't thought to have circulating immune cells

40:58.260 --> 41:01.820
 but about 10 years ago, it was sort of rediscovered

41:01.820 --> 41:02.880
 because if you look in the literature,

41:02.880 --> 41:04.700
 you realize this stuff was around longer,

41:04.700 --> 41:05.980
 that there's a glymphatic system.

41:05.980 --> 41:09.580
 It's sort of like a sewer system that clears out

41:09.580 --> 41:11.780
 the debris that surrounds neurons,

41:11.780 --> 41:13.340
 especially injured neurons.

41:13.340 --> 41:17.460
 And the glymphatic system is very active during sleep.

41:17.460 --> 41:20.100
 It's been imaged in functional

41:20.100 --> 41:21.900
 and magnetic resonance imaging.

41:21.900 --> 41:23.580
 And the glymphatic system is something

41:23.580 --> 41:24.980
 that you want very active

41:24.980 --> 41:26.760
 because it's going to clear away the debris

41:26.760 --> 41:28.900
 that sits between the neurons

41:28.900 --> 41:31.980
 and the cells that surround the connections

41:31.980 --> 41:34.440
 between the neurons called the glia,

41:34.440 --> 41:36.260
 those cells are actively involved

41:36.260 --> 41:40.140
 in repairing the connections between neurons when damaged.

41:40.140 --> 41:45.140
 So the glymphatic system is so important that many people,

41:46.340 --> 41:47.780
 if not all people who get TBI,

41:47.780 --> 41:50.740
 are told get adequate rest, you need to sleep.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.100
 And that's kind of twofold advice.

41:52.100 --> 41:54.180
 On the one hand, it's telling you to get sleep

41:54.180 --> 41:56.260
 because all these good things happen in sleep.

41:56.260 --> 41:59.140
 It's also about getting those people

41:59.140 --> 42:01.860
 to not continue to engage in their activity full-time

42:01.860 --> 42:03.620
 or really try and hammer through it.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.980
 You might say, well, if you have trouble sleeping,

42:06.980 --> 42:09.080
 how are you supposed to get deep sleep?

42:09.080 --> 42:11.100
 Most of the activity of the glymphatic system,

42:11.100 --> 42:12.580
 this washout of the debris

42:12.580 --> 42:15.080
 is occurring during slow wave sleep.

42:15.080 --> 42:18.080
 Slow wave sleep, as I mentioned in a previous episode,

42:18.080 --> 42:19.220
 is something that happens typically

42:19.220 --> 42:21.220
 in the early part of the evening.

42:21.220 --> 42:23.060
 So even for those of you that are falling

42:23.060 --> 42:24.460
 or early part of the night, rather,

42:24.460 --> 42:25.300
 if you're falling asleep

42:25.300 --> 42:26.900
 and then waking up three, four hours later,

42:26.900 --> 42:30.700
 it's important that you continue to get sleep,

42:30.700 --> 42:32.620
 but know that the slow wave sleep

42:32.620 --> 42:35.600
 is mainly packed toward the early part of the night.

42:35.600 --> 42:39.500
 So that hopefully will alleviate some of the anxiety

42:39.500 --> 42:41.060
 of the three and 4 a.m. wake up,

42:41.060 --> 42:43.620
 although you really should follow some of the protocols

42:43.620 --> 42:45.620
 that I've suggested in your physicians' protocols

42:45.620 --> 42:47.180
 in order to try and get regular,

42:47.180 --> 42:49.340
 longer sleep of seven, eight hours.

42:49.340 --> 42:51.000
 Later, we're going to talk about the eight-hour mark

42:51.000 --> 42:52.900
 as a prerequisite for repair.

42:52.900 --> 42:56.880
 The glymphatic system has been shown

42:56.880 --> 43:00.480
 to be activated further in two ways.

43:00.480 --> 43:05.480
 One is that sleeping on one side, not on back or stomach,

43:05.540 --> 43:09.500
 seems to increase the amount of washout,

43:09.500 --> 43:12.860
 or wash through, I should say, of the glymphatic system.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.200
 There aren't a ton of data on this,

43:14.200 --> 43:17.060
 but the data that exist are pretty solid.

43:17.060 --> 43:19.180
 Again, sleeping on one side

43:19.180 --> 43:23.380
 or with feet slightly elevated as well

43:23.380 --> 43:26.540
 has been shown to increase the rate of clearance

43:26.540 --> 43:27.780
 of some of the debris,

43:27.780 --> 43:31.260
 and that's because the way that the glymphatic system works

43:31.260 --> 43:35.580
 is it has a physical pressure fluid dynamic to it

43:35.580 --> 43:38.920
 that allow it to work more efficiently

43:38.920 --> 43:40.460
 when one is sleeping on their side

43:40.460 --> 43:42.100
 or with feet slightly elevated.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.220
 So this means not falling asleep

43:44.220 --> 43:46.100
 in a chair while watching TV.

43:46.100 --> 43:49.620
 This means, if possible, not falling asleep on one's back

43:49.620 --> 43:52.180
 or on one's stomach, sleeping on one's side,

43:52.180 --> 43:53.540
 and if you can't do that,

43:53.540 --> 43:55.020
 I don't really like to sleep on my side.

43:55.020 --> 43:56.500
 I sleep with my feet slightly elevated.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.540
 I put out the kind of thin pillow under my ankles.

43:58.540 --> 44:00.420
 I don't have TBI,

44:00.420 --> 44:03.540
 but I have had a few concussions before,

44:03.540 --> 44:05.480
 but right now I feel fine,

44:05.480 --> 44:08.180
 but I find that putting the pillow under my ankles

44:08.180 --> 44:10.000
 helps me sleep much more deeply,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.780
 and I wake up feeling much more refreshed.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.460
 The other thing that has been shown

44:15.460 --> 44:18.020
 to improve the function of the glymphatic system,

44:18.860 --> 44:21.820
 and this is, again, is for sake of TBI

44:21.820 --> 44:25.460
 as well as for everyone, even without brain injury,

44:25.460 --> 44:27.860
 is a certain form of exercise,

44:27.860 --> 44:29.740
 and I want to be very, very clear here.

44:29.740 --> 44:32.440
 I will never, and I am not suggesting

44:32.440 --> 44:35.300
 that people exercise in any way

44:35.300 --> 44:38.120
 that aggravates their injury

44:38.120 --> 44:41.400
 or that goes against their physician's advice.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.000
 Take your physician's advice

44:43.000 --> 44:45.940
 as to whether or not you should be exercising at all

44:45.940 --> 44:48.220
 and how much and into what intensity.

44:48.220 --> 44:51.300
 However, there's some interesting data,

44:51.300 --> 44:54.500
 and we can provide a link to the review on this.

44:54.500 --> 44:57.180
 It shows that exercise of what,

44:57.180 --> 45:00.060
 I guess people would nowadays call it zone two cardio,

45:00.060 --> 45:02.540
 which is kind of low-level cardio

45:02.540 --> 45:04.900
 that one could do while talking to somebody else.

45:04.900 --> 45:06.420
 You could maintain a conversation,

45:06.420 --> 45:08.300
 although you don't have to talk to somebody else.

45:08.300 --> 45:10.980
 It just gives you a sense of the intensity of the exercise.

45:10.980 --> 45:14.220
 That zone two cardio for 30 to 45 minutes

45:14.220 --> 45:19.220
 three times a week seems to improve the rates of clearance

45:19.500 --> 45:22.360
 of some of the debris after injury,

45:22.360 --> 45:24.620
 and in general, injury or no,

45:24.620 --> 45:28.760
 to accelerate and improve the rates of flow

45:28.760 --> 45:31.100
 for the glymphatic system.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.540
 I find this really interesting

45:32.540 --> 45:34.540
 because I think nowadays there's such an obsession

45:34.540 --> 45:36.740
 with high-intensity interval training

45:36.740 --> 45:39.140
 and people trying to pack in as much as they can

45:39.140 --> 45:41.220
 into a short workout, which is great

45:41.220 --> 45:42.540
 if it brings people to the table

45:42.540 --> 45:44.420
 who haven't been exercising before,

45:44.420 --> 45:47.520
 but I think it's really important that we know

45:47.520 --> 45:49.180
 that the data on exercise

45:49.180 --> 45:51.180
 and its relationship to brain health

45:51.180 --> 45:54.540
 speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes

45:54.540 --> 45:57.940
 of this kind of what we call low-level cardio.

45:57.940 --> 45:59.580
 It could be fast walking.

45:59.580 --> 46:00.900
 It could be jogging.

46:00.900 --> 46:03.060
 If you can do that with your injury safely,

46:03.060 --> 46:04.640
 it could be cycling.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.460
 This is not the kind of workout

46:06.460 --> 46:08.620
 that's designed to get your heart rate up

46:08.620 --> 46:10.880
 to the point where you're improving your fitness levels

46:10.880 --> 46:14.300
 at some sort of massive rate

46:14.300 --> 46:18.060
 or taking huge jumps in your VO2 max or anything like that.

46:18.060 --> 46:19.120
 This is exercise.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.020
 I do this, and I know a number of other people,

46:22.020 --> 46:23.180
 especially people in communities

46:23.180 --> 46:24.700
 where there is a lot of TBI

46:24.700 --> 46:27.000
 are now starting to adopt this,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.420
 that the 30 to 45 minutes, three times a week or so,

46:30.420 --> 46:34.700
 could be more, of this zone two type cardio

46:34.700 --> 46:37.820
 can be very beneficial for washout of debris from the brain.

46:37.820 --> 46:40.340
 And this is really interesting outside of TBI

46:40.340 --> 46:42.740
 because what we know from aging

46:42.740 --> 46:45.420
 is that aging is a nonlinear process.

46:45.420 --> 46:47.240
 It's not like with every year of life,

46:47.240 --> 46:48.860
 your brain gets a little older.

46:48.860 --> 46:50.660
 It has, sometimes it follows

46:50.660 --> 46:52.100
 what's more like a step function.

46:52.100 --> 46:55.720
 Like you get these big jumps in markers of aging.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.440
 I guess that we could think of them as jumps down

46:57.440 --> 47:00.020
 because it's a negative thing for most everybody

47:00.020 --> 47:00.980
 would like to live longer

47:00.980 --> 47:02.740
 and be healthier in brain and body.

47:02.740 --> 47:06.260
 And so the types of exercise I'm referring to now

47:06.260 --> 47:09.100
 are really more about brain longevity

47:09.100 --> 47:11.340
 and about keeping the brain healthy

47:11.340 --> 47:14.180
 than they are about physical fitness.

47:14.180 --> 47:15.640
 There's no reason why you couldn't do this

47:15.640 --> 47:19.160
 and also provided again, it's safe for you

47:19.160 --> 47:21.840
 given your brain state and injury state, et cetera.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.820
 There's no reason why you couldn't also combine it

47:24.820 --> 47:27.220
 with weight training and other forms of cardio.

47:27.220 --> 47:28.620
 So I think this is really interesting.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.740
 And if some of you would like to know the mechanism

47:30.740 --> 47:33.280
 or at least the hypothesized mechanism,

47:33.280 --> 47:36.860
 there's a molecule called aquaporin-4.

47:36.860 --> 47:40.120
 It almost sounds like the fourth in a sequel of movies

47:40.120 --> 47:40.960
 or something like that.

47:40.960 --> 47:44.580
 But aquaporin-4 is a molecule

47:44.580 --> 47:47.580
 that is related to the glial system.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.700
 So glia, it means glue in Latin,

47:49.700 --> 47:51.340
 are these cells in the brain,

47:51.340 --> 47:53.340
 the most numerous cells in the brain, in fact,

47:53.340 --> 47:56.100
 that in sheath synapses, but they're very dynamic cells.

47:56.100 --> 47:57.780
 They're like little ambulance cells.

47:57.780 --> 48:01.340
 The microglia will run in and will gather up debris

48:01.340 --> 48:04.500
 and soak it up and then run out after an injury.

48:04.500 --> 48:06.700
 Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed by the glial cell

48:06.700 --> 48:07.900
 called the astrocyte.

48:07.900 --> 48:09.980
 Astro, it looks like a little star.

48:09.980 --> 48:11.720
 Incredibly interesting cells.

48:11.720 --> 48:16.060
 And the thing to remember is that the astrocytes

48:16.060 --> 48:19.720
 bridge the connection between the neurons,

48:19.720 --> 48:22.980
 the synapse, the connections between them

48:22.980 --> 48:25.320
 and the vasculature, the blood system

48:25.320 --> 48:27.060
 and the glymphatic system.

48:27.060 --> 48:28.500
 So they kind of sit at the interface

48:28.500 --> 48:30.940
 and they kind of imagine somebody on an emergency site,

48:30.940 --> 48:33.260
 car crash site, who's directing everybody around

48:33.260 --> 48:34.100
 as to what to do.

48:34.100 --> 48:36.860
 Get that person on a stretcher, bandage them up,

48:36.860 --> 48:38.880
 call their mother, et cetera, et cetera,

48:38.880 --> 48:41.220
 get this out of the road, put down some flares.

48:41.220 --> 48:43.420
 The astrocytes kind of work in that capacity

48:43.420 --> 48:45.860
 as well as doing some things more directly.

48:45.860 --> 48:49.860
 So this glymphatic system and the glial astrocyte system

48:49.860 --> 48:52.780
 is a system that we want chronically active

48:52.780 --> 48:54.900
 throughout the day as much as possible.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.020
 So low level walking, zone two cardio,

48:57.020 --> 48:59.300
 and then at night during slow wave sleep

48:59.300 --> 49:02.260
 is then really when this glymphatic system kicks in.

49:02.260 --> 49:04.740
 So that should hopefully be an actionable takeaway

49:04.740 --> 49:07.400
 provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely

49:07.400 --> 49:09.660
 that I believe everybody should be doing

49:09.660 --> 49:11.240
 who cares about brain longevity,

49:11.240 --> 49:13.700
 not just people who are trying to get over TBI.

49:14.820 --> 49:16.460
 Now I'd like to return a little bit

49:16.460 --> 49:20.680
 to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation

49:20.680 --> 49:24.140
 because I think it's so interesting and so actionable

49:24.140 --> 49:26.800
 that everyone should know about this.

49:26.800 --> 49:30.620
 And in this case, we can also say that regardless

49:30.620 --> 49:32.200
 of whether or not you're experiencing pain,

49:32.200 --> 49:35.940
 acute or chronic, what I'm about to tell you

49:35.940 --> 49:39.860
 is as close as anything is to proof,

49:39.860 --> 49:41.580
 in science we rarely talk about proof,

49:41.580 --> 49:44.880
 we talk about evidence in favor or against a hypothesis,

49:44.880 --> 49:49.700
 but as close as possible to proof that our interpretation,

49:49.700 --> 49:52.380
 our subjective interpretation of a sensory event

49:52.380 --> 49:54.580
 is immensely powerful for dictating

49:54.580 --> 49:59.580
 our experience of the event, here are a couple examples.

49:59.660 --> 50:03.380
 First of all, anyone who's ever done combat sports

50:03.380 --> 50:07.900
 or martial arts knows that it's incredible

50:07.900 --> 50:11.820
 how little a punch hurts during a fight

50:11.820 --> 50:15.120
 and it's incredible how much it hurts after a fight.

50:15.120 --> 50:18.780
 The molecule adrenaline when it's liberated into our body

50:20.020 --> 50:22.980
 truly blunts our experience of pain.

50:22.980 --> 50:27.980
 We all know the stories of people walking miles

50:28.140 --> 50:32.220
 on stumped legs, people doing all sorts of things

50:32.220 --> 50:35.980
 that were incredible feats that allowed them

50:35.980 --> 50:38.020
 to move through what would otherwise be pain

50:38.020 --> 50:40.660
 and afterward they do experience extreme pain,

50:40.660 --> 50:42.600
 but during the event oftentimes

50:42.600 --> 50:44.300
 they are not experiencing pain

50:44.300 --> 50:46.900
 and that's because of the pain blunting effects

50:46.900 --> 50:47.980
 of adrenaline.

50:47.980 --> 50:50.540
 I'll tell you exactly how this works in a few minutes

50:50.540 --> 50:52.400
 when we talk about acupuncture,

50:52.400 --> 50:55.900
 but norepinephrine binding to particular receptors,

50:55.900 --> 50:57.840
 adrenaline binding to particular receptors

50:57.840 --> 51:00.480
 actually shuts down pain pathways.

51:02.900 --> 51:06.420
 People who anticipate an injection of morphine

51:06.420 --> 51:11.420
 immediately report the feeling of loss of pain.

51:11.780 --> 51:12.940
 Their pain starts to diminish

51:12.940 --> 51:16.020
 because they know they're going to get pain relief

51:16.020 --> 51:17.260
 and it's a powerful effect.

51:17.260 --> 51:19.460
 Now, all of you are probably saying placebo effect.

51:19.460 --> 51:21.220
 Placebo effects are very real.

51:21.220 --> 51:24.300
 Placebo effects and belief effects as they're called

51:24.300 --> 51:26.660
 have a profound effect on our experience

51:26.660 --> 51:29.500
 of noxious stimuli like pain

51:29.500 --> 51:31.160
 and they can also have a profound effect

51:31.160 --> 51:32.740
 on positive stimuli and things

51:32.740 --> 51:35.020
 that we're looking forward to.

51:35.020 --> 51:37.860
 One study that I think is particularly interesting here

51:37.860 --> 51:39.780
 is from my colleague at Stanford, Sean Mackey.

51:39.780 --> 51:41.580
 They did a neuroimaging study.

51:41.580 --> 51:43.000
 They subjected people to pain.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.220
 In this case, it was a heat pain.

51:45.220 --> 51:47.780
 People have very specific thresholds to heat

51:47.780 --> 51:50.780
 at which they cannot tolerate any more heat,

51:50.780 --> 51:52.260
 but they explored the extent

51:52.260 --> 51:54.980
 to which looking at an image of somebody,

51:54.980 --> 51:57.740
 in this case, a romantic partner that the person loved,

51:58.780 --> 52:02.160
 would allow them to adjust their pain response.

52:03.220 --> 52:05.100
 And it turns out it does.

52:05.100 --> 52:07.100
 If people are looking at an image

52:07.100 --> 52:11.500
 or thinking about a person that they love

52:11.500 --> 52:14.420
 or even a thing that they love, a pet that they love,

52:14.420 --> 52:17.600
 studies previous to the one that Mackey and colleagues did

52:17.600 --> 52:20.980
 showed that their experience of pain was reduced.

52:20.980 --> 52:23.060
 Their threshold for pain was higher.

52:23.060 --> 52:25.380
 They could tolerate more pain

52:25.380 --> 52:27.520
 and they reported it as not as painful.

52:28.420 --> 52:30.180
 But there's a twist there,

52:30.180 --> 52:32.100
 which is it turns out that the extent

52:32.100 --> 52:37.100
 to which love will modulate pain has everything to do

52:37.940 --> 52:41.620
 with how infatuated and obsessed somebody is

52:41.620 --> 52:44.520
 with the object of their love.

52:44.520 --> 52:49.260
 People that report thinking about somebody or a pet

52:49.260 --> 52:52.540
 for many hours of the day,

52:52.540 --> 52:54.380
 kind of having an obsessive nature,

52:54.380 --> 52:56.340
 like almost like kind of what people might call,

52:56.340 --> 52:57.860
 quote, unquote, codependency.

52:57.860 --> 52:58.820
 For those of you that are listening,

52:58.820 --> 53:00.100
 I'm just providing air quotes

53:00.100 --> 53:02.220
 because codependency is kind of a clinical thing now,

53:02.220 --> 53:04.460
 although it's thrown around a lot all the time.

53:04.460 --> 53:05.540
 It's sort of like gaslighting.

53:05.540 --> 53:07.040
 People talk about gaslighting all the time.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.860
 Now, gaslighting is a real thing,

53:08.860 --> 53:10.560
 but then people talk about gaslighting

53:10.560 --> 53:15.000
 for many things outside the clinical description.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.340
 If people are very obsessed with somebody,

53:18.340 --> 53:21.400
 they have a kind of obsessive love of somebody's face,

53:21.400 --> 53:22.940
 even if the other person doesn't know them,

53:22.940 --> 53:24.140
 which is a little weird,

53:25.420 --> 53:29.600
 that response, that feeling of love internally

53:29.600 --> 53:34.180
 can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree.

53:34.180 --> 53:36.140
 These are not small effects.

53:36.140 --> 53:38.820
 So it's not just that love can protect us from pain.

53:38.820 --> 53:41.140
 It's that infatuation and obsession

53:41.140 --> 53:42.260
 can protect us from pain.

53:42.260 --> 53:45.940
 And not surprisingly, how early a relationship is,

53:45.940 --> 53:48.340
 how new a relationship is,

53:48.340 --> 53:51.480
 directly correlates with people's ability, they showed,

53:51.480 --> 53:55.860
 to use this love, this internal representation of love

53:55.860 --> 53:58.140
 to blunt the pain response.

53:58.140 --> 54:00.300
 So for those of you that have been with your partners

54:00.300 --> 54:02.060
 for many years and you love them very much

54:02.060 --> 54:04.180
 and you're obsessed with them, terrific.

54:04.180 --> 54:06.460
 You have a pre-installed,

54:06.460 --> 54:07.540
 well, I suppose it's not pre-installed.

54:07.540 --> 54:09.460
 You had to do the work because relationships are work,

54:09.460 --> 54:14.060
 but you've got a installed mechanism for blunting pain.

54:14.060 --> 54:16.400
 And again, these are not minor effects.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.420
 These are major effects.

54:18.420 --> 54:20.900
 And it's all going to be through that top-down modulation

54:20.900 --> 54:21.740
 that we talked about,

54:21.740 --> 54:24.380
 not unlike the mirror box experiments with phantom limb

54:24.380 --> 54:26.220
 that relieve phantom pain

54:26.220 --> 54:29.020
 or some other top-down modulation.

54:29.020 --> 54:31.280
 And the opposite example is the nail through the boot,

54:31.280 --> 54:33.260
 which is a visual image that made the person

54:33.260 --> 54:35.780
 think it was painful when in fact it was painful,

54:35.780 --> 54:37.960
 even though there was no tissue damage.

54:37.960 --> 54:39.900
 It was all perceptual.

54:39.900 --> 54:41.900
 So the pain system is really subject

54:41.900 --> 54:44.460
 to these perceptual influences,

54:44.460 --> 54:47.420
 which is remarkable because really,

54:47.420 --> 54:49.120
 when we think about the somatosensory system,

54:49.120 --> 54:50.460
 it has this cognitive component,

54:50.460 --> 54:52.220
 it's got this peripheral component,

54:52.220 --> 54:54.220
 but there's another component,

54:54.220 --> 54:56.700
 which is the way in which our sensation,

54:56.700 --> 54:58.380
 our somatosensory system is woven in

54:58.380 --> 55:00.340
 with our autonomic nervous system.

55:00.340 --> 55:01.620
 And we're going to get to that next,

55:01.620 --> 55:04.740
 but I want to just raise the idea

55:04.740 --> 55:07.340
 that the reason that this kind of infatuation

55:07.340 --> 55:10.560
 and obsessive love can blunt the pain response

55:10.560 --> 55:13.220
 and increase one's threshold for pain

55:13.220 --> 55:16.740
 may have to do, I would say almost certainly has to do,

55:16.740 --> 55:20.500
 but it hasn't been measured yet with dopamine release,

55:20.500 --> 55:23.160
 because dopamine is absolutely the molecule

55:23.160 --> 55:26.580
 that's liberated in our brain and body

55:26.580 --> 55:30.900
 when there's a new kind of obsession or infatuation,

55:30.900 --> 55:34.460
 it's very distinct from the kind of love chemicals,

55:34.460 --> 55:37.700
 if you will, I don't even like calling them love chemicals,

55:37.700 --> 55:38.620
 that just feels weird,

55:38.620 --> 55:40.400
 if this were text, I would delete that line,

55:40.400 --> 55:45.380
 but from the chemicals associated with warmth and connection

55:45.380 --> 55:47.560
 such as serotonin and oxytocin,

55:47.560 --> 55:49.600
 which tend to be for more stable,

55:49.600 --> 55:50.900
 long lasting relationships,

55:50.900 --> 55:53.620
 dopamine is what dilates the pupils,

55:53.620 --> 55:54.820
 which gets people really excited,

55:54.820 --> 55:56.420
 they can't stop thinking about somebody,

55:56.420 --> 55:58.580
 the text messages are even exciting,

55:58.580 --> 56:00.860
 they write to them and they can't wait

56:00.860 --> 56:02.360
 for the text message to come back,

56:02.360 --> 56:03.740
 the dot, dot, dot on the screen,

56:03.740 --> 56:05.660
 the text message is excruciating,

56:05.660 --> 56:07.200
 they don't respond for two minutes

56:07.200 --> 56:08.600
 and people are getting flipped out,

56:08.600 --> 56:12.340
 I'm not here to support that kind of whatever,

56:12.340 --> 56:16.220
 what I'm saying is that that obsessive type of love,

56:16.220 --> 56:18.780
 which without question is going to be associated

56:18.780 --> 56:19.860
 with the dopamine pathway,

56:19.860 --> 56:23.380
 does seem to have a utility in the context

56:23.380 --> 56:28.340
 of reducing the unpleasantness of physical pain

56:28.340 --> 56:30.220
 and probably has a lot to do with reducing

56:30.220 --> 56:31.540
 the unpleasantness of a lot of life,

56:31.540 --> 56:32.940
 like sitting in traffic, et cetera,

56:32.940 --> 56:34.900
 because when we talk about pain,

56:34.900 --> 56:36.500
 emotional pain and physical pain

56:36.500 --> 56:38.500
 start to become one in the same,

56:38.500 --> 56:40.980
 they are so closely intertwined

56:40.980 --> 56:44.700
 that the lines between them neurally become very blurry,

56:44.700 --> 56:45.820
 what do I mean by that?

56:45.820 --> 56:50.820
 Well, if love and infatuation can reduce pain,

56:51.120 --> 56:52.980
 presumably through the release of dopamine,

56:52.980 --> 56:56.380
 well then does dopamine release itself, blunt pain,

56:56.380 --> 56:59.340
 should we be chasing dopamine release

56:59.340 --> 57:01.500
 as a way to treat chronic and acute pain?

57:01.500 --> 57:03.760
 And that's exactly what we're going to talk about now,

57:03.760 --> 57:04.860
 independent of love,

57:04.860 --> 57:06.420
 we're going to talk about something quite different,

57:06.420 --> 57:08.540
 which is putting needles and electricity

57:08.540 --> 57:09.820
 in different parts of the body,

57:09.820 --> 57:11.020
 so-called acupuncture,

57:11.020 --> 57:14.180
 something that for many people,

57:15.820 --> 57:19.240
 it's been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine,

57:19.240 --> 57:21.480
 but now there are excellent laboratories

57:21.480 --> 57:25.100
 exploring what's called electroacupuncture and acupuncture,

57:25.100 --> 57:26.660
 these are big university centers,

57:26.660 --> 57:30.140
 in fact, my source for everything I'm about to tell you next

57:30.140 --> 57:33.400
 is Professor Chufu Ma at Harvard Medical School

57:33.400 --> 57:34.300
 and his papers,

57:34.300 --> 57:35.580
 I stand behind the information

57:35.580 --> 57:36.580
 that I'm going to provide today,

57:36.580 --> 57:40.720
 but it's extracted largely from the Ma lab's papers,

57:40.720 --> 57:45.720
 which are very rigorous, variable isolating experiments

57:46.100 --> 57:49.540
 to address just how does something like acupuncture work?

57:49.540 --> 57:51.260
 And I think what you'll be interested in

57:51.260 --> 57:53.860
 and surprised to learn is that it does work,

57:53.860 --> 57:57.020
 but sometimes it can exacerbate pain

57:57.020 --> 57:59.220
 and sometimes it can relieve pain

57:59.220 --> 58:01.740
 and it all does that through very discrete pathways

58:01.740 --> 58:04.000
 for which we can really say,

58:04.000 --> 58:05.460
 this neuron connects to that neuron,

58:05.460 --> 58:06.460
 connects to the adrenals

58:06.460 --> 58:08.820
 and we can tie this all back to dopamine

58:08.820 --> 58:09.660
 because in the end,

58:09.660 --> 58:11.340
 it's the chemicals and neural circuits

58:11.340 --> 58:13.380
 that are giving rise to these perceptions

58:13.380 --> 58:14.980
 or these experiences rather

58:14.980 --> 58:17.600
 of things that we call pain, love, et cetera.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.520
 In a previous podcast episode,

58:19.520 --> 58:23.220
 I mentioned my experience of visiting an acupuncturist

58:23.220 --> 58:25.280
 and getting acupuncture,

58:25.280 --> 58:30.100
 the acupuncture itself didn't really do that much for me,

58:30.100 --> 58:32.040
 but I wasn't there for any specific reason.

58:32.040 --> 58:35.260
 It was gifted to me by somebody and I wanted to try it.

58:35.260 --> 58:37.740
 I'm not passing judgment on acupuncture.

58:37.740 --> 58:39.140
 In fact, I know a number of people

58:39.140 --> 58:41.580
 that really derive tremendous benefit

58:41.580 --> 58:45.620
 from acupuncture for pain and for gastrointestinal issues.

58:45.620 --> 58:48.980
 There are actually a lot of really good peer reviewed studies

58:48.980 --> 58:50.900
 supporting the use of acupuncture

58:50.900 --> 58:55.760
 for in particular GI tract issues.

58:55.760 --> 58:57.660
 In recent years, there's been an emphasis

58:57.660 --> 58:59.580
 on trying to understand the mechanism

58:59.580 --> 59:03.140
 of things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself,

59:03.140 --> 59:05.220
 not to support acupuncture

59:05.220 --> 59:07.080
 or to try to get everybody to do acupuncture,

59:07.080 --> 59:08.740
 but as a way to try and understand

59:08.740 --> 59:12.880
 how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people

59:12.880 --> 59:15.660
 who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system

59:15.660 --> 59:18.260
 or brain-body relationship in general.

59:18.260 --> 59:21.580
 And actually the National Institutes of Health

59:21.580 --> 59:26.260
 in the United States now has a entire subdivision,

59:26.260 --> 59:29.640
 an institute within the National Institutes of Health,

59:29.640 --> 59:32.180
 which is complimentary health.

59:32.180 --> 59:36.820
 And that institute is interested in things like acupuncture

59:36.820 --> 59:38.620
 and a variety of other practices

59:38.620 --> 59:41.060
 that I think 10, 15 years ago,

59:41.060 --> 59:43.040
 people probably thought were really alternative

59:43.040 --> 59:46.360
 and maybe even counterculture, at least in the States.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.260
 And it's exciting.

59:47.260 --> 59:49.060
 I think people are starting to really take a look

59:49.060 --> 59:51.300
 at what's going on under the hood

59:51.300 --> 59:53.820
 for certain types of treatments that are very useful.

59:53.820 --> 59:55.540
 And I think it's very likely to lead

59:55.540 --> 59:57.480
 to an expanded number of treatments

59:57.480 --> 59:59.380
 for a number of different conditions.

1:00:00.620 --> 1:00:02.800
 What I want to talk about in terms of acupuncture

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:06.520
 is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:10.620
 the crosstalk between the somatosensory system,

1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:13.960
 our ability to feel stuff externally,

1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:16.780
 exteroception, internally, interoception,

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:21.620
 and how that somatosensory system is wired in with

1:00:21.620 --> 1:00:23.960
 and communicating with our autonomic nervous system

1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:27.960
 that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness.

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:33.460
 After that, I'm going to talk about how the acupuncture

1:00:33.460 --> 1:00:36.540
 that's being done right now also points to relief

1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:38.780
 for what's called referred pain.

1:00:38.780 --> 1:00:41.300
 So this takes us all back to the homunculus.

1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:42.140
 Let's start there.

1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:44.640
 We have this representation of our body surface

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:47.440
 in our brain.

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:50.940
 That representation is what we call somatotopic.

1:00:50.940 --> 1:00:54.180
 And what somatotopy is is it just means

1:00:54.180 --> 1:00:56.760
 that areas of your body that are near one another,

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:59.220
 so your thumb and your forefinger, for instance,

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:00.740
 are represented by neurons

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:03.000
 that are nearby each other in the brain.

1:01:04.020 --> 1:01:05.420
 Now you might say, well, duh,

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:06.980
 but actually it didn't have to be that way.

1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:09.080
 The neurons that represent the tip of my forefinger

1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:11.640
 and the neurons that represent my thumb on the same hand

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:13.740
 could have been distantly located.

1:01:13.740 --> 1:01:16.380
 And therefore the map of my body surface,

1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:17.820
 the homunculus would be really disordered,

1:01:17.820 --> 1:01:18.660
 but it's not that way.

1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:20.860
 It's very ordered, it's very smooth.

1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:22.780
 As let's say you were to image my brain,

1:01:22.780 --> 1:01:24.940
 if you were to stimulate my finger, my forefinger,

1:01:24.940 --> 1:01:27.220
 and then march that stimulation across my finger,

1:01:27.220 --> 1:01:29.620
 across the palm into the nearby thumb,

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:31.120
 you would see that neurons in the brain

1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:32.900
 would also make a sort of J shape

1:01:32.900 --> 1:01:34.940
 in their pattern of activation.

1:01:34.940 --> 1:01:37.880
 So that means they're so-called somatotopy,

1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:40.500
 but the connections from those brain neurons

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:42.340
 are sent into the body

1:01:42.340 --> 1:01:45.340
 and they are synchronized with,

1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:49.700
 meaning they cross wire with and form synapses

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:53.780
 with some of the input from the viscera,

1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:56.920
 from our guts, from our diaphragm, from our stomach,

1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:00.380
 from our spleen, from our heart.

1:02:00.380 --> 1:02:02.780
 Our internal organs are sending information

1:02:02.780 --> 1:02:06.120
 up to this map in our brain of the body surface,

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:07.840
 but it's about internal information,

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:09.340
 what we call interoception,

1:02:09.340 --> 1:02:11.780
 our ability to look inside or imagine inside

1:02:11.780 --> 1:02:14.020
 and feel what we're feeling inside.

1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:17.020
 So the way to think about this accurately

1:02:17.020 --> 1:02:19.660
 is that our representation of ourself

1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:22.620
 is a representation of our internal workings,

1:02:22.620 --> 1:02:25.260
 our viscera, our guts, everything inside our skin

1:02:25.260 --> 1:02:27.340
 and the surface of our skin

1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:30.100
 and the external world, what we're seeing.

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:31.940
 Those three things are always being combined

1:02:31.940 --> 1:02:36.100
 in a very interesting, complex, but very seamless way.

1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:40.500
 Acupuncture involves taking needles

1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:43.680
 and sometimes electricity and or heat as well

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:47.220
 and stimulating particular locations on the body.

1:02:47.220 --> 1:02:49.920
 And through these maps of stimulation

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:52.880
 that have been developed over thousands of years,

1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:55.260
 mostly in Asia,

1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:58.500
 but now this is a practice that's being done

1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:00.380
 many places throughout the world,

1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:02.480
 they have these maps that speak to,

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:04.420
 oh, well, if you stimulate this part of the body,

1:03:04.420 --> 1:03:05.460
 you get this response.

1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:07.300
 And if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue,

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:09.900
 like their guts are moving too quick, they have diarrhea,

1:03:09.900 --> 1:03:10.960
 you stimulate this area

1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:12.840
 and it'll slow their gut motility down.

1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:15.500
 Or if their gut motility is too slow, they're constipated,

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.680
 you stimulate someplace else and it accelerates it.

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.240
 And hearing about this, it sounds kind of to a Westerner

1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:24.300
 who's not thinking about the underlying neural circuitry,

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:25.740
 it could sound kind of wacky.

1:03:25.740 --> 1:03:27.140
 It really sounds like alternative

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:29.760
 or even kind of really out there kind of stuff.

1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:32.360
 But when you look at the neural circuitry, the neuroanatomy,

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:33.540
 it really starts to make sense.

1:03:33.540 --> 1:03:36.820
 And Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School

1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:39.780
 is an excellent laboratory,

1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:43.860
 has been exploring how stimulation of different types,

1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:47.680
 intense or weak, with heat or without heat

1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:50.060
 on different parts of the body

1:03:50.060 --> 1:03:53.660
 can modulate pain and inflammation.

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:57.940
 And what they've shown in a particularly exciting study

1:03:57.940 --> 1:04:00.060
 is that stimulation of the abdomen

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000
 anywhere on the midsection weekly does nothing.

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:08.180
 That's not very interesting, you might say.

1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:11.080
 Intense stimulation of the abdomen, however,

1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:14.900
 with this electroacupuncture has a very strong effect

1:04:15.860 --> 1:04:19.620
 of increasing inflammation in the body.

1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:21.780
 And this is important to understand

1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:25.380
 because it's not just that stimulating the gut does this

1:04:25.380 --> 1:04:28.100
 because you're activating the gut area,

1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:30.940
 it activates a particular nerve pathway.

1:04:30.940 --> 1:04:34.520
 For the aficionados, it's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis

1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:38.500
 if you really want to know, and it's pro-inflammatory

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:40.020
 under most conditions.

1:04:40.020 --> 1:04:43.260
 However, there are other conditions where if, for instance,

1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:46.300
 the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection

1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:48.100
 that can be beneficial.

1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:51.020
 And this goes back to a much earlier discussion

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:52.500
 that we had on a previous podcast

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.380
 that we'll revisit again and again,

1:04:54.380 --> 1:04:56.060
 which is that the stress response

1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:58.000
 was designed to combat infection.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.160
 So it turns out that there are certain patterns

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.560
 of stimulation on the abdomen

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:04.060
 that can actually liberate immune cells

1:05:04.060 --> 1:05:07.060
 from our immune organs, like our spleen,

1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:08.860
 and counter infection

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:11.620
 through the release of things like adrenaline.

1:05:11.620 --> 1:05:15.120
 Chufu's lab also showed that stimulation

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:20.120
 of the feet and hands can reduce inflammation.

1:05:21.300 --> 1:05:23.380
 And again, this was done mechanistically.

1:05:23.380 --> 1:05:26.260
 This was done by blocking certain pathways

1:05:26.260 --> 1:05:28.380
 with the appropriate control experiments.

1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:31.980
 This was done not in any kind of subjective way.

1:05:31.980 --> 1:05:34.580
 This was also done by measuring particular molecules,

1:05:34.580 --> 1:05:36.420
 IL-6 and cytokines,

1:05:36.420 --> 1:05:39.100
 and things that are related to the inflammation response.

1:05:39.100 --> 1:05:41.780
 And what they showed is that the stimulation of the,

1:05:41.780 --> 1:05:46.780
 in particular, the hind limbs at low intensity

1:05:47.380 --> 1:05:51.380
 led to increases in the activity of this vagal pathway,

1:05:51.380 --> 1:05:53.340
 the vagus nerve being this 10th cranial nerve

1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:56.260
 that serves the kind of rest and digest and parasympathetic,

1:05:56.260 --> 1:05:58.180
 in other words, calming response.

1:05:58.180 --> 1:06:00.940
 So what this means is that we are now at the front edge

1:06:00.940 --> 1:06:03.820
 of this research field that's just,

1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:05.100
 it's early days still,

1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:07.420
 but it's discovering that depending on whether or not

1:06:07.420 --> 1:06:10.020
 the stimulation is intense or mild,

1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:13.260
 and depending on where the stimulation is done on the body,

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:14.680
 you can get very different effects.

1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:16.820
 So this points to the idea that

1:06:16.820 --> 1:06:20.020
 you can't say acupuncture good or acupuncture bad.

1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:22.940
 There has to be a systematic understanding

1:06:22.940 --> 1:06:26.300
 of what exactly the effect is that you're trying to achieve.

1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.820
 And the underlying basis for this is really relevant

1:06:28.820 --> 1:06:31.500
 to the thing about adrenaline that I said before,

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:34.700
 that in a fight, it's rare that you ever feel pain

1:06:34.700 --> 1:06:35.540
 when you get hit.

1:06:35.540 --> 1:06:38.460
 I've experienced that, but later it hurts a lot.

1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:40.940
 It turns out that when you stimulate these pathways

1:06:40.940 --> 1:06:43.940
 that activate, in particular, the adrenals,

1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:47.460
 the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine and epinephrine,

1:06:47.460 --> 1:06:49.140
 and the brain does as well,

1:06:49.140 --> 1:06:50.180
 it binds to what are called

1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:52.540
 the beta-noreadrenergic receptors.

1:06:52.540 --> 1:06:54.500
 Okay, so this is really getting kind of down into the weeds,

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:57.980
 but the beta-noreadrenergic receptors activate the spleen,

1:06:57.980 --> 1:07:01.180
 which liberates cells that combat infection,

1:07:01.180 --> 1:07:03.920
 and it's anti-inflammatory.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:06.660
 That's the short-term quick response.

1:07:06.660 --> 1:07:11.620
 The more intense stimulation of the abdomen and other areas

1:07:11.620 --> 1:07:14.020
 can be pro-inflammatory

1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:16.940
 because of the ways that they trigger certain loops

1:07:16.940 --> 1:07:18.380
 that go back to the brain

1:07:18.380 --> 1:07:20.500
 and trigger the sort of anxiety pathways,

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:22.420
 and that place people into a state of anxiety

1:07:22.420 --> 1:07:24.180
 that exacerbates pain.

1:07:24.180 --> 1:07:27.300
 So one pathway stimulates norepinephrine and blunts pain.

1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:28.740
 The other one doesn't.

1:07:28.740 --> 1:07:29.780
 What does all this mean?

1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.820
 How are we supposed to put all of this together?

1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:32.660
 Well, there's a paper

1:07:32.660 --> 1:07:34.980
 that was published in Nature Medicine in 2014,

1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:36.900
 this is an excellent journal,

1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:40.460
 that describes how dopamine

1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:43.260
 can activate the vagus peripherally,

1:07:43.260 --> 1:07:45.300
 not dopamine in the brain, peripherally,

1:07:45.300 --> 1:07:49.260
 and norepinephrine can activate the vagus peripherally

1:07:49.260 --> 1:07:50.820
 and reduce inflammation.

1:07:50.820 --> 1:07:53.620
 And I'm not trying to throw a ton of facts at you and say,

1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:55.260
 well, what am I supposed to do with all this information?

1:07:55.260 --> 1:07:58.340
 What this means is that there are real maps

1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:00.700
 of our body surface that when stimulated

1:08:01.620 --> 1:08:04.140
 communicate with our autonomic nervous system,

1:08:04.140 --> 1:08:06.820
 the system that controls alertness or calmness,

1:08:06.820 --> 1:08:09.580
 and thereby releases either molecules

1:08:09.580 --> 1:08:10.980
 like norepinephrine and dopamine,

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:14.980
 which make us more alert as we would be in a fight

1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:17.460
 and blunt our response to pain,

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:20.340
 and they reduce inflammation.

1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:23.660
 But there are yet other pathways that when stimulated

1:08:23.660 --> 1:08:26.340
 are pro-inflammatory, and that brings us to the question

1:08:26.340 --> 1:08:28.300
 of what is all this inflammation stuff

1:08:28.300 --> 1:08:29.180
 that people are talking about?

1:08:29.180 --> 1:08:32.660
 One of the things that bothers me so much these days,

1:08:32.660 --> 1:08:34.140
 and I'm not easily irritated,

1:08:34.140 --> 1:08:36.420
 but what really bothers me is when people

1:08:36.420 --> 1:08:38.600
 are talking about inflammation, like inflammation is bad,

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:39.880
 inflammation is terrific,

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.820
 inflammation is the reason why cells

1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:44.180
 are called to the site of injury to clear it out.

1:08:44.180 --> 1:08:46.160
 Inflammation is what's going to allow you

1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:47.900
 to heal from any injury.

1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:50.060
 Chronic inflammation is bad,

1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:52.960
 but acute inflammation is absolutely essential.

1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:54.920
 Remember those kids that we talked about earlier

1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:57.820
 that have mutations in these receptors for sensing pain,

1:08:57.820 --> 1:08:59.160
 they never get inflammation,

1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:03.260
 and that's why their joints literally disintegrate.

1:09:03.260 --> 1:09:04.220
 It's really horrible

1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:06.780
 because they don't actually have the inflammation response

1:09:06.780 --> 1:09:09.860
 because it was never triggered by the pain response.

1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:13.320
 So inflammation can be very beneficial.

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:16.340
 There's a lot of interest nowadays in taking things

1:09:16.340 --> 1:09:17.940
 and doing things to limit inflammation.

1:09:17.940 --> 1:09:19.940
 One of the ones that comes up a lot is turmeric.

1:09:19.940 --> 1:09:22.340
 I'm sure the moment anyone starts talking about inflammation

1:09:22.340 --> 1:09:24.580
 the question is, what about turmeric?

1:09:24.580 --> 1:09:28.540
 I have talked before about turmeric elsewhere.

1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:30.660
 I am very skeptical of turmeric

1:09:30.660 --> 1:09:32.500
 and I might lose a few friends,

1:09:32.500 --> 1:09:34.220
 although that'd be weird if my friend,

1:09:34.220 --> 1:09:35.540
 that would say something about my friendships

1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:38.340
 if I lost friends over a discussion about turmeric.

1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:40.940
 But in any case,

1:09:40.940 --> 1:09:44.260
 turmeric does have anti-inflammatory properties.

1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:45.480
 There's no question about that.

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:47.980
 But as we've just described,

1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:49.500
 inflammation can be a very good thing,

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:50.820
 at least in the short term.

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:52.000
 The other thing about turmeric

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.540
 is there was a study published out of Stanford

1:09:54.540 --> 1:09:56.580
 in collection with some work from other universities

1:09:56.580 --> 1:09:58.860
 showing that a lot of turmeric

1:09:58.860 --> 1:10:01.300
 is heavily contaminated with lead.

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:04.580
 The lead is used to get that really rich, dense,

1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:08.240
 you know, orange coloring to it that everyone wants to see.

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:10.020
 So you have to check your sources of turmeric.

1:10:10.020 --> 1:10:13.660
 The other thing is for men in particular,

1:10:13.660 --> 1:10:17.780
 turmeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrotestosterone.

1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:21.620
 Dihydrotestosterone is the more dominant form of androgen

1:10:21.620 --> 1:10:23.780
 in human males.

1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:27.100
 And it's involved in things like aggression and libido

1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:28.340
 and things of that sort.

1:10:28.340 --> 1:10:32.180
 Many people that I've talked to who have taken turmeric

1:10:32.180 --> 1:10:35.620
 get a severe blunting of affect and libido.

1:10:35.620 --> 1:10:39.060
 So for some people, that might be a serious negative.

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:40.700
 I certainly avoid turmeric.

1:10:40.700 --> 1:10:43.320
 I don't like turmeric for that reason.

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:45.100
 I also think that the inflammation response

1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:46.740
 is a healthy response.

1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:48.700
 You have to keep it in check.

1:10:48.700 --> 1:10:50.400
 And we're going to talk about specific practices

1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:52.740
 for wound, healing, and injury in a moment.

1:10:52.740 --> 1:10:55.900
 But this idea that just inflammation is bad

1:10:55.900 --> 1:10:57.720
 and you want to reduce inflammation across the board,

1:10:57.720 --> 1:10:59.300
 nothing could be further from the truth.

1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:01.860
 We have pathways that exist in our body

1:11:01.860 --> 1:11:03.920
 specifically to increase inflammation.

1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:06.820
 It's the inflammation that goes unchecked,

1:11:06.820 --> 1:11:09.640
 just like stress, which is problematic

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:11.380
 for repair from brain injury

1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:14.580
 and that can exacerbate certain forms of dementia, et cetera.

1:11:14.580 --> 1:11:16.720
 But I'd like to create a little bit more nuance

1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:18.260
 or a lot more nuance if possible

1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:20.740
 in the conversation around inflammation

1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:23.540
 because people have just taken this discussion

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:26.140
 around inflammation to be this idea

1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:27.860
 that just inflammation is bad

1:11:27.860 --> 1:11:30.460
 and nothing could be further from the truth.

1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:33.540
 Before I continue, I just thought I'd answer a question

1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:37.020
 that I get a lot, which is what about Wim Hof breathing?

1:11:37.020 --> 1:11:38.100
 I get asked about this a lot.

1:11:38.100 --> 1:11:41.660
 Wim Hof, also called AKA the Iceman,

1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:44.580
 has this breathing that's similar to Tummo breathing

1:11:44.580 --> 1:11:45.700
 as it was originally called,

1:11:45.700 --> 1:11:47.460
 involves basically hyperventilating

1:11:47.460 --> 1:11:49.620
 and then doing some exhales and some breath holds.

1:11:49.620 --> 1:11:50.660
 A couple of things about that,

1:11:50.660 --> 1:11:52.660
 it should never be done near water.

1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:53.780
 People who have done it near water,

1:11:53.780 --> 1:11:55.180
 unfortunately, have drowned.

1:11:56.340 --> 1:11:58.620
 It's certainly not for everybody

1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:01.420
 and I'm not here to either promote it

1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:03.520
 nor discourage people from doing it.

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:04.780
 But I think we should ask ourselves,

1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:06.180
 what is the net effect of that?

1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:08.860
 Because a number of people have asked me about it

1:12:08.860 --> 1:12:10.860
 in relation to pain management.

1:12:10.860 --> 1:12:13.100
 The effect of doing that kind of breathing,

1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:14.380
 it's not a mysterious effect,

1:12:14.380 --> 1:12:17.220
 it liberates adrenaline from the adrenals.

1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:18.820
 There is a paper published in the proceeds

1:12:18.820 --> 1:12:20.240
 of the National Academy of Sciences,

1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:21.620
 which is a very fine journal,

1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:23.480
 showing that that breathing pattern

1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:26.480
 can counter infection from endotoxin.

1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:29.420
 And that's because when you have adrenaline in your system

1:12:29.420 --> 1:12:31.220
 and when the spleen is very active,

1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:36.940
 that response is used to counter infection

1:12:36.940 --> 1:12:39.820
 and stress counters infection.

1:12:39.820 --> 1:12:41.420
 We'll talk about this more going forward,

1:12:41.420 --> 1:12:44.700
 but the idea that stress lends itself to infection is false.

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:48.060
 Stress counters infection by liberating killer cells

1:12:48.060 --> 1:12:49.200
 in the body.

1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:50.340
 You don't want the stress response

1:12:50.340 --> 1:12:52.540
 to stay on indefinitely, however.

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:56.280
 Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,

1:12:56.280 --> 1:12:57.780
 anything that releases adrenaline

1:12:57.780 --> 1:13:00.300
 will counter the infection.

1:13:01.300 --> 1:13:03.440
 But you want to regulate the duration

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:05.180
 of that adrenaline response.

1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:06.160
 This should make perfect sense.

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:08.280
 We, as a species, had to evolve

1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:09.740
 under conditions of famine and cold.

1:13:09.740 --> 1:13:12.080
 Actually, Texas right now is an extreme case

1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:13.540
 of cold and power outage.

1:13:13.540 --> 1:13:15.160
 I've seen the pictures and there are a lot of people

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.080
 out there really suffering.

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:19.680
 Their systems are releasing a ton of adrenaline.

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:20.740
 They're cold.

1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:22.820
 Some of them are likely to be hungry.

1:13:22.820 --> 1:13:24.360
 They're probably stressed.

1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:26.900
 They're releasing a lot of adrenaline,

1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:29.360
 which is keeping them safe from infection.

1:13:30.300 --> 1:13:32.880
 After they get their heat back on and they relax

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:34.500
 and they can finally warm up again,

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.420
 which we would like for them very soon.

1:13:37.420 --> 1:13:38.880
 Hopefully by the time this podcast comes out,

1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:40.500
 that will have already happened.

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:42.480
 That's typically when people get sick

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:44.500
 because the immune response is blunted

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.980
 as the stress response starts to subside.

1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:51.420
 So stress, inflammation, countering infection

1:13:51.420 --> 1:13:52.680
 that comes from endotoxin,

1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:54.140
 that comes from any number of things,

1:13:54.140 --> 1:13:56.220
 can be from cold, it can be from hyperventilation,

1:13:56.220 --> 1:13:58.040
 it can be from a physical threat,

1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:02.680
 it can be from the stress of an exam or an upcoming surgery.

1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:05.380
 This adrenaline thing and the inflammation associated

1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:08.740
 with it is adaptive, it's highly adaptive.

1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:11.580
 It is a short-term plasticity that is designed

1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:14.100
 to make us better for what we're experiencing

1:14:14.100 --> 1:14:16.860
 and challenged with, not worse.

1:14:16.860 --> 1:14:19.100
 And so hopefully that will add an additional layer

1:14:19.100 --> 1:14:21.140
 to this whole idea that stress is bad,

1:14:21.140 --> 1:14:23.260
 inflammation is bad, et cetera.

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:25.780
 Again, I'm not suggesting people do

1:14:25.780 --> 1:14:28.500
 or don't do something like Wim Hof Tummo breathing.

1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:29.780
 I just want to point to the utility.

1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:32.100
 It's very similar to the utility from cold showers,

1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:34.580
 ice baths, and other forms of anything

1:14:34.580 --> 1:14:36.500
 that increase adrenaline.

1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:38.060
 Every episode, I want to make sure

1:14:38.060 --> 1:14:39.660
 that every listener comes away

1:14:39.660 --> 1:14:42.020
 with as much knowledge as possible,

1:14:42.020 --> 1:14:44.340
 but also actionable tools.

1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:46.360
 And today we've talked about a variety of tools,

1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:50.120
 but I want to center in on a particular sequence of tools

1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:52.260
 that hopefully you won't need,

1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:55.540
 but presumably if you're a human being and you're active,

1:14:55.540 --> 1:14:57.100
 you will need at some point.

1:14:57.100 --> 1:15:02.100
 It's about managing injury and recovering and healing fast,

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:04.320
 or at least as fast as possible.

1:15:05.900 --> 1:15:07.340
 It includes removing the pain,

1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:10.000
 it includes getting mobility back

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.360
 and getting back to a normal life,

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:14.140
 whatever that means for you.

1:15:14.140 --> 1:15:17.340
 I want to emphasize that what I'm about to talk about next

1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:20.980
 was developed in close consultation with Kelly Starrett,

1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:24.160
 who many of you probably have heard of before.

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.900
 Kelly can be found at The Ready State.

1:15:25.900 --> 1:15:27.380
 He's a formally trained,

1:15:27.380 --> 1:15:30.780
 so degreed and educated exercise physiologist.

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:32.340
 He's a world expert in movement

1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:34.980
 and tissue rehabilitation, et cetera.

1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:36.780
 They're not sponsors of the podcast.

1:15:36.780 --> 1:15:38.500
 Kelly is a friend and a colleague.

1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:40.240
 He's somebody that I personally trust

1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:44.120
 and his views on tissue rehabilitation and injury,

1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:47.900
 I think are really grounded extremely well

1:15:47.900 --> 1:15:50.300
 in both medicine, physiology,

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.460
 and the real cutting edge of what's new

1:15:53.460 --> 1:15:56.580
 and what you might not get in terms of advice

1:15:56.580 --> 1:15:58.120
 from the typical person.

1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:00.100
 All that said, you always, always, always

1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:01.340
 should consult with your physician

1:16:01.340 --> 1:16:05.640
 before adopting any protocols or removing any protocols.

1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:07.620
 So I asked Kelly, I made it really simple.

1:16:07.620 --> 1:16:10.660
 I said, okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle

1:16:10.660 --> 1:16:14.060
 or break my arm or injure my knee or ACL tear

1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:16.740
 or something like that, or shoulder injury.

1:16:16.740 --> 1:16:20.440
 What are the absolute necessary things to do

1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:21.740
 regardless of situation?

1:16:21.740 --> 1:16:25.020
 And what science is this grounded in?

1:16:25.020 --> 1:16:27.580
 And then I made it a point to go find the studies

1:16:27.580 --> 1:16:32.040
 that either supported or refuted what he was telling me

1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:34.480
 because that's why I'm here.

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:37.400
 So the first one is a very basic one

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:39.660
 that now you have a lot of information to act on,

1:16:39.660 --> 1:16:43.900
 which is in terms of what we know about tissue rehabilitation

1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:46.380
 both brain and body, we know that sleep is essential.

1:16:46.380 --> 1:16:49.820
 And so we both agreed that eight hours minimum

1:16:49.820 --> 1:16:51.280
 in bed per night is critical.

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:52.780
 Now, what was interesting, however,

1:16:52.780 --> 1:16:55.940
 is that it doesn't have to be eight hours of sleep.

1:16:55.940 --> 1:16:58.220
 We acknowledge that some of that time

1:16:58.220 --> 1:16:59.940
 might be challenging to get to sleep,

1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:03.040
 especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited.

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:05.260
 We forget how often we roll over in bed

1:17:05.260 --> 1:17:09.020
 or how the conditions of our sleeping

1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:11.060
 can impact those injuries too.

1:17:11.060 --> 1:17:14.720
 So Kelly acknowledged and I agree

1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:17.000
 that eight hours of sleep would be ideal,

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.180
 but if not at least eight hours immobile,

1:17:19.180 --> 1:17:20.300
 and that speaks to the power

1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:22.500
 of these non-sleep deep rest protocols too.

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:25.340
 If you can't sleep doing non-sleep deep rest protocols,

1:17:25.340 --> 1:17:26.860
 we've provided links to them before,

1:17:26.860 --> 1:17:28.240
 we're going to continue to provide links

1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.460
 to the previous ones and new ones are coming soon,

1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:32.780
 that is extremely beneficial.

1:17:32.780 --> 1:17:36.320
 So that's a non-negotiable in terms of getting

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:39.380
 the foundation for allowing for glymphatic clearance

1:17:39.380 --> 1:17:41.020
 and tissue clearance, et cetera.

1:17:41.020 --> 1:17:42.820
 The other is, if possible,

1:17:42.820 --> 1:17:45.460
 unless it's absolutely excruciating

1:17:45.460 --> 1:17:47.900
 or you just can't do it, a 10 minute walk per day,

1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:50.000
 of course, you don't want to exacerbate the injury,

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.820
 at least a 10 minute walk per day and probably longer.

1:17:53.820 --> 1:17:55.060
 This is where it gets interesting.

1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:57.620
 I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself,

1:17:57.620 --> 1:17:58.900
 you're supposed to ice something,

1:17:58.900 --> 1:17:59.980
 you're supposed to put ice on it,

1:17:59.980 --> 1:18:01.180
 but I didn't realize this,

1:18:01.180 --> 1:18:03.940
 but when speaking to exercise physiologists

1:18:03.940 --> 1:18:05.140
 and some physicians,

1:18:05.140 --> 1:18:08.960
 they said that the ice is really more of a placebo.

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:12.060
 It numbs the environment of the injury,

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.100
 which is not surprising,

1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:15.980
 and will eliminate the pain for a short while,

1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:18.340
 but it has some negative effects

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:21.080
 that perhaps offset its use.

1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:24.420
 One, it sludges, it creates sludging within the blood

1:18:24.420 --> 1:18:25.800
 and other lymphatic tissue.

1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:28.420
 So it actually can create some like clotting and sludging

1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:33.420
 of the tissue and fluids, the fascial interface with muscle,

1:18:34.260 --> 1:18:36.180
 and a number of the stuff

1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:38.700
 that's supposed to be flowing through there can slow up

1:18:38.700 --> 1:18:40.660
 and increase inflammation in the wrong way,

1:18:40.660 --> 1:18:44.940
 can actually restrict movement out of the injury site,

1:18:44.940 --> 1:18:47.740
 which is bad because you want the macrophages

1:18:47.740 --> 1:18:50.500
 and the other cell types, phagocytosing,

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:53.020
 eating up the debris and injury

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:56.280
 and moving it out of there so that it can repair.

1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:57.520
 So that was surprising to me,

1:18:57.520 --> 1:18:59.700
 which made me ask, well, then what about heat?

1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:03.060
 Well, it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial.

1:19:03.060 --> 1:19:04.840
 A lot of people talk about heat shock proteins

1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:07.700
 and all these genetic pathways and protein pathways

1:19:07.700 --> 1:19:09.200
 that can be activated by heat.

1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:13.020
 Very little data to support the idea

1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:15.060
 that heat shock proteins are part

1:19:15.060 --> 1:19:16.820
 of the wound healing process,

1:19:16.820 --> 1:19:19.880
 at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:22.380
 that one could use like a hot water bottle

1:19:22.380 --> 1:19:25.540
 or a hot bath or a hot compress.

1:19:25.540 --> 1:19:27.660
 The major effects seem to be explained

1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:31.240
 by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues

1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:35.380
 and the clearance and the perfusion of fluid,

1:19:35.380 --> 1:19:38.820
 blood, lymph, and other fluids out of the injury area.

1:19:38.820 --> 1:19:39.680
 So that's really interesting.

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:40.520
 I didn't know this.

1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:41.980
 I thought, well, you're supposed to ice something.

1:19:41.980 --> 1:19:44.340
 I said, well, whenever I would like see a kid get injured

1:19:44.340 --> 1:19:47.340
 in soccer, never me, of course, no, of course,

1:19:47.340 --> 1:19:48.860
 I got injured in soccer from time to time,

1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:49.860
 they give you an ice pack.

1:19:49.860 --> 1:19:52.300
 And the ice pack removes some of the pain.

1:19:52.300 --> 1:19:54.420
 I think the consensus now,

1:19:54.420 --> 1:19:56.540
 which was surprising to me is that the ice pack

1:19:56.540 --> 1:19:58.780
 is actually more of the top-down modulation.

1:19:58.780 --> 1:20:01.420
 You think you're doing something for the pain.

1:20:01.420 --> 1:20:02.780
 There's some interesting studies

1:20:02.780 --> 1:20:05.000
 that actually showed the placebo effect of the ice pack.

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:07.540
 So ice packs are placebo, perhaps.

1:20:07.540 --> 1:20:08.380
 That's interesting.

1:20:08.380 --> 1:20:10.080
 I'll underline perhaps because who knows,

1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:11.240
 maybe there's some people out there

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:13.700
 that are gonna say this is totally crazy

1:20:13.700 --> 1:20:15.620
 and the ice is actually very beneficial,

1:20:15.620 --> 1:20:20.620
 but it seems like heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement.

1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:22.860
 And it turns out that the movement itself

1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:24.900
 can act as a bit of an analgesic.

1:20:24.900 --> 1:20:26.720
 It can actually reduce the pain.

1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:28.420
 Whereas the ice reduces the pain,

1:20:28.420 --> 1:20:32.020
 but sludges the tissue and keeps the cells

1:20:32.020 --> 1:20:35.560
 that need to be removed from leaving the area.

1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:38.820
 Now, what's also interesting is in neuroscience,

1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:42.540
 we know that if we wanna kill neurons or silence neurons,

1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:43.860
 we cool them.

1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:46.500
 This is a well-known tool in the laboratory.

1:20:46.500 --> 1:20:50.380
 Some of the early and most important studies in neuroscience

1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:52.140
 that form the basis for the textbooks

1:20:52.140 --> 1:20:53.740
 were lowering a cooling probe

1:20:53.740 --> 1:20:56.020
 into a particular area of the brain or a peripheral nerve

1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:57.700
 in order to shut down that nerve.

1:20:57.700 --> 1:21:00.040
 So the cooling will shut down the nerve.

1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:03.100
 But another very well-known fact

1:21:03.100 --> 1:21:06.240
 in neuroscience textbooks is that when the activity

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.860
 of the nerve pathway or neurons comes back,

1:21:08.860 --> 1:21:11.140
 there's what's called homeostatic plasticity

1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:13.460
 that it rebounds with greater pain

1:21:13.460 --> 1:21:14.940
 with a higher level of intensity,

1:21:14.940 --> 1:21:17.100
 which in the pain system would equate to greater pain.

1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:19.660
 So regardless of where these neurons are in the body,

1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:22.020
 if you stimulate a neuron, it's active.

1:21:22.020 --> 1:21:24.000
 If you cool it, it becomes inactive.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.060
 And when the neuron heats back up after being cooled,

1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:28.940
 it becomes hyperactive.

1:21:28.940 --> 1:21:32.380
 And so this makes really good sense as to why heat,

1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:34.520
 provided it's not damaging levels of heat,

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:37.500
 would be more beneficial for wound healing

1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:40.460
 and for reducing pain in the short and long run

1:21:40.460 --> 1:21:45.460
 than would be cold or ice, which I find very interesting.

1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:49.460
 Now, in terms of chronic pain, the manuscripts on this,

1:21:49.460 --> 1:21:52.940
 my discussion with Kelly and with others point to the fact

1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:56.100
 that chronic pain is basically plasticity gone wrong.

1:21:56.100 --> 1:21:59.260
 It's sort of like PTSD for the emotional system

1:21:59.260 --> 1:22:00.620
 and the stress system.

1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:03.260
 And chronic pain is going to involve a number

1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:07.340
 of different protocols to rewire both the brain centers

1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:09.620
 and the peripheral centers associated with chronic pain.

1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:11.820
 Certain things like fibromyalgia, for instance,

1:22:11.820 --> 1:22:16.460
 which is whole body pain, relate to too little inhibition.

1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:18.460
 In the brain, you have excitation and inhibition.

1:22:18.460 --> 1:22:19.860
 They come from different sources of neurons.

1:22:19.860 --> 1:22:24.280
 The inhibition is mainly from GABA and glycine

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:25.480
 and things like that.

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:29.620
 In fibromyalgia, there's too little central

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:33.740
 within the brain modulation of the pain responses

1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:36.060
 so that people experience whole body pain.

1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:38.420
 So in that case, the emerging therapies

1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:39.240
 are really interesting.

1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:40.220
 I have a friend who works

1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:41.420
 for the National Institutes of Health

1:22:41.420 --> 1:22:44.100
 who unfortunately suffers from fibromyalgia

1:22:44.100 --> 1:22:45.580
 who asked me about this a lot.

1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:48.860
 And his question and what he's now actually exploring

1:22:48.860 --> 1:22:50.260
 is red light therapy.

1:22:50.260 --> 1:22:53.380
 Something that I've talked about on various Instagram posts,

1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:55.060
 red light therapy typically is talked about

1:22:55.060 --> 1:22:56.960
 in terms of mitochondria.

1:22:56.960 --> 1:22:59.540
 And the data on that are not so terrific,

1:22:59.540 --> 1:23:02.340
 at least not really published in blue ribbon journals

1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:04.920
 in most cases, except for one study that I'm aware of

1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:07.540
 from Glenn Jeffrey's lab at University College London

1:23:07.540 --> 1:23:09.660
 showing that red light stimulation to the eyes

1:23:09.660 --> 1:23:12.700
 in people 40 or older can offset some of the effects

1:23:12.700 --> 1:23:14.860
 of macular degeneration by improving the health

1:23:14.860 --> 1:23:16.580
 of the photoreceptors.

1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:19.820
 People with fibromyalgia, which is this whole body pain

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:22.940
 are now starting to use red light therapies.

1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:26.800
 And I asked Kelly and others and some experts in pain,

1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:29.500
 what are your thoughts on this red light therapy

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:32.180
 for things like fibromyalgia and pain,

1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:33.940
 especially red light local therapy?

1:23:34.820 --> 1:23:38.480
 Their idea, and I don't think this is a field

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:39.820
 that's progressed far enough now

1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:42.360
 to really place any firm conclusions on,

1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:45.780
 but the idea is that red light therapy locally

1:23:45.780 --> 1:23:49.300
 may have some effect, but the systemic red light therapy,

1:23:49.300 --> 1:23:52.820
 this is like wearing protection to the eyes in some cases,

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:55.100
 so not from the treatment of macular degeneration,

1:23:55.100 --> 1:23:56.420
 but wearing protection to the eyes

1:23:56.420 --> 1:23:59.500
 and getting very bright red light therapy,

1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:02.460
 in many ways may be, to use Kelly's words,

1:24:02.460 --> 1:24:04.320
 approximating the effects of nature.

1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:06.060
 These are like surrogate technologies

1:24:06.060 --> 1:24:07.780
 for getting outside in the sunshine.

1:24:07.780 --> 1:24:09.420
 When you're in the sun, it might not look red,

1:24:09.420 --> 1:24:12.060
 but there are a lot of red wavelengths coming toward you.

1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:14.880
 So the red light therapies may have some utility,

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:16.780
 but getting into sunlight

1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:19.940
 may actually have as much or more effect.

1:24:19.940 --> 1:24:21.860
 Of course, if these wounds are on a part of the body

1:24:21.860 --> 1:24:23.300
 that you can't expose,

1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:25.300
 then you could imagine why the red light therapy

1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:26.180
 might be good, I don't know,

1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:27.660
 depending on the neighborhood you live in,

1:24:27.660 --> 1:24:29.460
 that may or may not be a weird thing to go outside

1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:31.100
 and expose your body to sunlight.

1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:33.760
 Probably a number of factors that dictate

1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:34.940
 whether or not that'd be weird or not,

1:24:34.940 --> 1:24:36.620
 but that's up to you, not me.

1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:41.620
 And it seems that, so movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep,

1:24:44.700 --> 1:24:47.560
 and in some cases, the use,

1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:48.940
 and I'll talk about this in a moment,

1:24:48.940 --> 1:24:52.500
 some cases, the use of restricting above and below the injury

1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:54.540
 to then release and then increase perfusion

1:24:54.540 --> 1:24:58.500
 through the site, so may actually accelerate

1:24:58.500 --> 1:24:59.560
 the wound healing.

1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:01.980
 So all of this might sound just like common sense knowledge,

1:25:01.980 --> 1:25:04.660
 but to me, at least as a 45-year-old,

1:25:04.660 --> 1:25:07.100
 I always just thought it's ice, it's non-steroid,

1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:08.700
 anti-inflammatory drugs,

1:25:08.700 --> 1:25:10.780
 it's things that block prostaglandin,

1:25:10.780 --> 1:25:14.300
 so things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen,

1:25:14.300 --> 1:25:16.420
 those things generally work by blocking things

1:25:16.420 --> 1:25:21.420
 like they're called cox prostaglandin blockers

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.120
 and things of that sort, things in that pathway.

1:25:24.980 --> 1:25:28.420
 Those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation

1:25:28.420 --> 1:25:29.860
 may not be so great at the beginning

1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:31.340
 when you want inflammation,

1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:33.460
 they may be important for limiting pain

1:25:33.460 --> 1:25:35.380
 so people can be functional at all,

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:37.660
 but the things that I talked about today

1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:41.180
 really are anchored in three principles.

1:25:41.180 --> 1:25:44.940
 One is that the inflammation response is a good one.

1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:45.820
 This is what we're learning

1:25:45.820 --> 1:25:48.800
 from Chufu Ma's lab's work on acupuncture.

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:51.120
 The immediate acute inflammation response is good.

1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:53.900
 It calls to the site of injury,

1:25:53.900 --> 1:25:56.800
 things that are going to clean up the injury in bad cells.

1:25:57.820 --> 1:25:58.860
 Then there are going to be things

1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:00.460
 that are going to improve perfusion

1:26:00.460 --> 1:26:03.740
 like the glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,

1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:06.040
 feet elevated, sleeping on one side,

1:26:07.540 --> 1:26:11.060
 low level zone two cardio three times a week.

1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:13.180
 Red light perhaps is going to be useful

1:26:13.180 --> 1:26:15.380
 although sunlight might be just as good

1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:16.820
 depending on who you talk to.

1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:20.420
 And we talk about that probably more at length

1:26:20.420 --> 1:26:21.620
 in a future episode.

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:24.580
 A number of people will ask me I'm sure about stem cells

1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:27.500
 and I don't want to take more of your time

1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:29.900
 by going into an hour long discussion about stem cells.

1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:31.820
 Stem cells exist in all of us during development.

1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:33.820
 We were created from stem cells

1:26:33.820 --> 1:26:36.420
 which are cells that can become essentially anything.

1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:39.160
 Later cells get what's called restricted in their lineage.

1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:40.220
 So a skin cell,

1:26:40.220 --> 1:26:44.200
 unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it,

1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:46.860
 you can't actually turn that cell into a neuron.

1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:49.060
 Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize

1:26:49.060 --> 1:26:51.100
 for finding these Yamanaka factors

1:26:51.100 --> 1:26:53.060
 which you could give a skin cell to turn into a neuron

1:26:53.060 --> 1:26:55.540
 but that's not an approved therapy at this time.

1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:59.220
 But many people ask me about platelet rich plasma,

1:26:59.220 --> 1:27:00.860
 so-called PRP.

1:27:00.860 --> 1:27:04.140
 They take blood, they enrich for platelets

1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:06.340
 and then they re-inject it back into people.

1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:07.180
 Here's the deal.

1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.740
 This deserves an entire episode.

1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:13.500
 It has never been shown whether or not the injection itself

1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:16.140
 is what's actually creating the effect.

1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:17.920
 This is something that the acupuncture literature

1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:19.420
 suffered from for a long time

1:27:19.420 --> 1:27:22.040
 that the sham control as it's called,

1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:23.340
 sham we don't mean it's a sham

1:27:23.340 --> 1:27:24.980
 but in science you say a sham control

1:27:24.980 --> 1:27:26.860
 meaning you do everything

1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:28.760
 that exactly the same way you would like.

1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:30.140
 So for acupuncture,

1:27:30.140 --> 1:27:33.380
 you would bring the needle right up to the skin

1:27:33.380 --> 1:27:35.420
 but you wouldn't actually poke it into the skin.

1:27:35.420 --> 1:27:37.960
 For instance, that would be a sham control.

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:38.900
 With a drug treatment,

1:27:38.900 --> 1:27:41.860
 you would inject a drug into a person

1:27:41.860 --> 1:27:43.620
 and then the control, the sham control

1:27:43.620 --> 1:27:45.580
 would be that you would bring the injection over.

1:27:45.580 --> 1:27:47.780
 You might do the injection or not do the injection

1:27:47.780 --> 1:27:49.340
 because you imagine that the injection itself

1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:50.560
 could have an effect.

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:52.620
 It's never really been shown whether or not PRP

1:27:52.620 --> 1:27:53.900
 has effects that are separate

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:56.980
 from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue.

1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:00.020
 The claims that PRP actually contains stem cells

1:28:00.020 --> 1:28:02.940
 are very, very feeble.

1:28:02.940 --> 1:28:05.220
 And when you look at the literature

1:28:05.220 --> 1:28:08.300
 and you talk to anyone expert in the stem cell field,

1:28:08.300 --> 1:28:12.500
 they will tell you that the number of stem cells in PRP

1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:14.220
 is infinitesimally small.

1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:18.700
 In fact, so much so that these places that inject PRP

1:28:18.700 --> 1:28:21.580
 for injuries are not allowed to advertise

1:28:21.580 --> 1:28:23.420
 through the use of the words stem cells.

1:28:23.420 --> 1:28:24.980
 It's actually illegal at this point.

1:28:24.980 --> 1:28:26.100
 At least as far as I know,

1:28:26.100 --> 1:28:28.260
 it was through the end of last year

1:28:28.260 --> 1:28:30.580
 and I'm guessing it still is now.

1:28:30.580 --> 1:28:32.940
 Stem cells are an exciting area of technology.

1:28:32.940 --> 1:28:35.940
 However, there's a clinic down in Florida

1:28:35.940 --> 1:28:37.820
 that was shut down a couple of years ago

1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:41.300
 for injecting stem cells harvested from patients

1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:43.100
 into the eye for macular degeneration.

1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:46.460
 These were people that were suffering from poor vision

1:28:46.460 --> 1:28:49.400
 and very shortly after injecting these stem cells

1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:51.860
 into the eyes, they went completely blind.

1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:56.240
 So I'm somebody who is very skeptical

1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:59.740
 of the stem cell treatment work that's out there.

1:28:59.740 --> 1:29:01.820
 It's actually very hard to get in the United States

1:29:01.820 --> 1:29:03.860
 for this reason, it's not approved.

1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:06.320
 The PRP treatments are very complicated.

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:11.320
 The marketing around them is shaky at best.

1:29:11.540 --> 1:29:14.060
 I'm sure a number of people will say that they had PRP

1:29:14.060 --> 1:29:17.060
 and benefited from it tremendously and I don't doubt that.

1:29:17.060 --> 1:29:18.340
 Whether or not it was placebo,

1:29:18.340 --> 1:29:20.260
 today we talked a lot about top-down control.

1:29:20.260 --> 1:29:24.220
 That's just a variant on the word placebo, belief effects.

1:29:24.220 --> 1:29:26.940
 Whether or not it was placebo or not, I don't know.

1:29:26.940 --> 1:29:29.740
 I wasn't there, that's for you to decide.

1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:31.000
 And I'm not here to tell you

1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:32.320
 that you should or shouldn't do something,

1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:34.800
 but I do think that anything involving stem cells,

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.340
 one should be very cautious of.

1:29:36.340 --> 1:29:37.780
 You should also be very cautious of anyone

1:29:37.780 --> 1:29:41.000
 that tells you that PRP is injecting a lot of stem cells.

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:42.480
 This is an evolving area

1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:45.420
 that really needs a lot more work and attention.

1:29:45.420 --> 1:29:49.160
 The major issue with stem cells that I think is concerning

1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:52.220
 is that stem cells are cells

1:29:52.220 --> 1:29:54.240
 that want to become lots of different things,

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:56.020
 not just the tissue that you're interested in.

1:29:56.020 --> 1:29:57.000
 So if you damage your knee

1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:00.060
 and you inject stem cells into your knee,

1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:02.700
 you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells

1:30:02.700 --> 1:30:05.580
 so that they don't become tumor cells, right?

1:30:05.580 --> 1:30:08.540
 A tumor is a collection of stem cells, right?

1:30:08.540 --> 1:30:10.260
 So when you get something horrible

1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:11.900
 like glioblastoma in the brain,

1:30:11.900 --> 1:30:14.240
 which is a terrible thing to have,

1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:18.080
 it's glial cells that returned to stemness,

1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:19.980
 excessive stemness, they've started to produce

1:30:19.980 --> 1:30:21.580
 too many of themselves.

1:30:21.580 --> 1:30:25.000
 And glioblastoma is often deadly, not always.

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.420
 So injecting stem cells, it sounds great,

1:30:27.420 --> 1:30:29.960
 and it sounds like something that one would want to do,

1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:33.100
 but one needs to approach this with extreme caution,

1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:36.580
 even if it's your own blood or stem cells

1:30:36.580 --> 1:30:37.440
 that you're re-injecting.

1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:40.440
 I think those technologies are coming, they're on the way.

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:44.940
 If any of you are devotees of PRP,

1:30:44.940 --> 1:30:46.500
 tell me your experiences with them.

1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:48.200
 I'm curious, I want to see the papers,

1:30:48.200 --> 1:30:49.220
 I want to know the evidence.

1:30:49.220 --> 1:30:51.400
 And of course, there are always folks out there that say,

1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:52.820
 I don't care what the scientists

1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:56.820
 and the physicians and the FDA say, I just want to do this.

1:30:56.820 --> 1:30:58.660
 And if that's your stance, that's your stance.

1:30:58.660 --> 1:31:00.340
 I'm not here to govern that.

1:31:00.340 --> 1:31:02.500
 But I do think that people should be informed.

1:31:02.500 --> 1:31:06.660
 And in thinking about tissue recovery and injury,

1:31:06.660 --> 1:31:08.300
 that's what I was able to glean.

1:31:08.300 --> 1:31:12.220
 Again, check out what Kelly and his coworkers are doing

1:31:12.220 --> 1:31:13.940
 at the ReadyState, it's phenomenal.

1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:16.840
 And they've worked with all the top people in

1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:18.640
 just about every domain of life it seems,

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:20.120
 very high integrity folks.

1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:23.520
 Some of you are probably saying, well, I'm not injured,

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:25.620
 I'm not an athlete, I don't want stem cell injections.

1:31:25.620 --> 1:31:27.780
 I don't have, again, I think you shouldn't get

1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:29.580
 stem cell injections for now.

1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:31.620
 Please hold off until the field learns more

1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:33.180
 about how to do that safely.

1:31:33.180 --> 1:31:38.060
 But I want to talk about and end with a really interesting

1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:43.060
 and somewhat weird technology, which is baby blood.

1:31:43.060 --> 1:31:46.760
 I have a colleague at Stanford, his name is Tony Weiss Corey.

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:50.920
 And in 2014, his laboratory published a study showing

1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:55.920
 that the blood of young rodents, mice and rats,

1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:01.040
 when transfused into old demented rodents, mice and rats,

1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:05.960
 made those old demented rodents recover much of their memory

1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:10.960
 and seem much more vital and energetic,

1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:15.960
 better recall of different spatial learning tasks,

1:32:16.180 --> 1:32:19.380
 tissue and wound healing, they've since shown

1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:22.080
 can be improved in these older animals.

1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:23.220
 It's pretty incredible.

1:32:24.100 --> 1:32:26.380
 They went on to show several years later

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:31.380
 that blood from umbilical cords, I'm not making this up,

1:32:31.420 --> 1:32:35.280
 blood from umbilical cords can do the same.

1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:37.740
 And this is the basis of a biotech company,

1:32:37.740 --> 1:32:39.460
 actually one of my former postdocs

1:32:39.460 --> 1:32:41.820
 is now an employee there.

1:32:41.820 --> 1:32:46.200
 They've isolated the molecules from young blood

1:32:46.200 --> 1:32:51.200
 that seems to vitalize or revitalize the old brain

1:32:52.220 --> 1:32:54.140
 and body and one of those molecules

1:32:54.140 --> 1:32:56.940
 goes by the name TIMP2, T-I-M-P, two.

1:32:58.340 --> 1:32:59.860
 Where's all this going?

1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:02.980
 Well, I don't know how long it's going to be

1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:04.540
 before there are treatments based

1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:07.900
 on these blood transfusions.

1:33:07.900 --> 1:33:11.380
 I doubt that blood transfusions themselves

1:33:11.380 --> 1:33:13.700
 from young people into old people

1:33:13.700 --> 1:33:16.740
 is going to be used for the treatment of dementia.

1:33:16.740 --> 1:33:19.900
 Although it might, as weird as it seems,

1:33:19.900 --> 1:33:22.660
 we know that transfusions of all sorts of stuff,

1:33:22.660 --> 1:33:24.380
 for instance, fecal transplants

1:33:24.380 --> 1:33:25.740
 are being used to treat obesity.

1:33:25.740 --> 1:33:28.700
 The gut microbiome of thin people

1:33:28.700 --> 1:33:32.980
 is being not transfused but is being transplanted

1:33:32.980 --> 1:33:36.100
 into the colons and guts of obese people

1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:37.440
 and leading to weight loss,

1:33:37.440 --> 1:33:40.540
 which sounds really wild and is not a topic

1:33:40.540 --> 1:33:42.580
 I particularly enjoy talking about.

1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:45.780
 But nonetheless, it points to the importance

1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:47.860
 of the gut microbiome in regulating things

1:33:47.860 --> 1:33:51.820
 like blood sugar and health as it relates to obesity

1:33:51.820 --> 1:33:54.780
 and diabetes and all sorts of things.

1:33:54.780 --> 1:33:57.300
 So it does appear that there are things,

1:33:57.300 --> 1:34:01.840
 factors in the blood of young members of a given species

1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:06.840
 that are lost over time in the older members of that species.

1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:08.300
 I am not going to give you a tool

1:34:08.300 --> 1:34:10.160
 on the basis of these findings today.

1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:14.720
 I am not going to tell you to consume any fluid

1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.420
 from any other member of your species, our species,

1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:21.520
 for any reason.

1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:23.680
 But I do think that it's important to mention

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.400
 that the science is asking questions

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:31.600
 such as what are the factors within the brain

1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:34.840
 that allow the young brain to recover so much better

1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:37.000
 than the older brain from injury,

1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:40.940
 from all sorts of things, events, et cetera.

1:34:40.940 --> 1:34:43.740
 And what are the factors in the older brain

1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:45.160
 that are limiting?

1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:49.040
 And thinking about identifying which factors

1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:53.560
 are going to allow people to restore cognitive function,

1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:56.320
 physical function, wound healing, and so forth.

1:34:56.320 --> 1:34:57.720
 It's a really exciting area.

1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:00.160
 I mention it not to be sensationalist,

1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:02.220
 but because it's happening

1:35:02.220 --> 1:35:05.680
 and because there's a lot of excitement about it.

1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:08.660
 And because I think it's clear

1:35:08.660 --> 1:35:12.020
 that the young brain and body and blood

1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:16.240
 are very different from the old brain, body, and blood.

1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:18.880
 And the goal of science is to identify

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:21.920
 and isolate those factors that make that so

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:27.040
 such that people who would otherwise get dementia

1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:29.880
 or perhaps even have dementia will be allowed to recover.

1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:34.340
 Again, not an actionable item at this point,

1:35:34.340 --> 1:35:38.580
 but one to think about, perhaps not too long,

1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:39.960
 but one to think about.

1:35:40.860 --> 1:35:42.220
 So I'm going to close there.

1:35:42.220 --> 1:35:44.980
 I've talked about a lot of tools today.

1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:48.100
 I've talked a lot about somatosensation,

1:35:48.100 --> 1:35:51.740
 about plasticity, about pain, about acupuncture,

1:35:51.740 --> 1:35:55.800
 some of the nuance of acupuncture, inflammation, stress.

1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.180
 We even talked a little bit about high intensity breathing.

1:35:59.180 --> 1:36:01.700
 I've talked about restricting limb movement

1:36:01.700 --> 1:36:05.560
 to get compensatory regrowth of pathways,

1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:08.060
 or I should say reactivation of pathways

1:36:08.060 --> 1:36:09.700
 that have been injured or damaged.

1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:13.780
 So as always, we take kind of a whirlwind tour

1:36:13.780 --> 1:36:18.160
 through a given topic, lay down some tools as we go.

1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:22.380
 Hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury,

1:36:22.380 --> 1:36:24.900
 but also neuroplasticity in general today

1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:26.860
 in the context of the somatosensory system

1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:28.260
 will be of use to all of you.

1:36:28.260 --> 1:36:31.020
 I don't wish injury on any of you,

1:36:31.020 --> 1:36:34.580
 but I do hope that you'll take this information to mind

1:36:34.580 --> 1:36:35.780
 and that you will think about it

1:36:35.780 --> 1:36:38.300
 if ever you find yourself in a situation

1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:39.580
 where you have to ask,

1:36:39.580 --> 1:36:41.800
 what's the difference between my perception

1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:43.020
 and the actual tissue damage?

1:36:43.020 --> 1:36:44.340
 Is it injury and pain?

1:36:44.340 --> 1:36:45.180
 Is it the same?

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.020
 Well, no.

1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:48.660
 Do I have some control over my experience of pain?

1:36:48.660 --> 1:36:49.880
 Absolutely.

1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:51.780
 Does all of that involve taking drugs

1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:53.100
 or doing certain therapeutics?

1:36:53.100 --> 1:36:54.180
 No, not necessarily.

1:36:54.180 --> 1:36:56.900
 There's an incredible subjective component.

1:36:56.900 --> 1:37:00.940
 There also is a need sometimes to treat the injury

1:37:00.940 --> 1:37:03.360
 at the level of the pain receptors

1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:05.180
 at the site of the wound.

1:37:05.180 --> 1:37:09.400
 So please take the information, do with it what you will.

1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:11.020
 And in the meantime,

1:37:11.020 --> 1:37:13.380
 thank you so much for your time and attention.

1:37:13.380 --> 1:37:15.420
 Before we go, I just want to remind you

1:37:15.420 --> 1:37:17.740
 to please subscribe to the YouTube channel,

1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:19.380
 Apple and or Spotify,

1:37:19.380 --> 1:37:21.100
