00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.260
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.260 --> 00:15.660
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.400
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.400 --> 00:19.060
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.060
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.060 --> 00:23.100
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.100 --> 00:25.340
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.340 --> 00:26.960
 to the general public.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.220
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.220 --> 00:31.220
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.540
 Our first sponsor is Four Sigmatic.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.460
 Four Sigmatic is a wellness company

00:36.460 --> 00:38.060
 that makes mushroom coffee.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.180
 And if you're asking yourself,

00:39.180 --> 00:41.380
 why would you want to put mushrooms in coffee?

00:41.380 --> 00:42.340
 First of all, let me tell you,

00:42.340 --> 00:44.460
 these are not psychedelic mushrooms,

00:44.460 --> 00:47.020
 and no, the coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.660
 The coffee is delicious,

00:48.660 --> 00:50.900
 and you don't taste mushrooms at all.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.980
 I know this because I've been using Four Sigmatic coffee

00:53.980 --> 00:56.940
 and been stocking it in my laboratory for several years now,

00:56.940 --> 00:58.900
 long before I ever had the podcast,

00:58.900 --> 01:01.100
 or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.520
 The two kinds of mushrooms that are in Four Sigmatic coffee

01:03.520 --> 01:06.220
 are lion's mane and chaga mushrooms,

01:06.220 --> 01:07.260
 both of which have been shown

01:07.260 --> 01:10.600
 to have a slight anxiolytic effect to reduce anxiety.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.460
 And lion's mane has also been shown in several studies

01:13.460 --> 01:16.440
 to lower the symptoms of depression just slightly,

01:16.440 --> 01:19.120
 although I wouldn't consider it a treatment for depression.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.640
 That's an attractive benefit,

01:20.640 --> 01:24.020
 as well as have some effect at offsetting cognitive decline.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.140
 Albeit slightly, the effects were real

01:26.140 --> 01:28.600
 in the studies that I found.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.220
 So if you'd like to try Four Sigmatic,

01:30.220 --> 01:33.700

01:49.660 --> 01:53.100
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.760
 Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books

01:55.760 --> 01:58.320
 condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways

01:58.320 --> 02:00.480
 that you can read or listen to.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.200
 I'm a big reader and I'm a big consumer of nonfiction.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.820
 And most of the time I consume books

02:05.820 --> 02:06.940
 in their traditional form,

02:06.940 --> 02:09.380
 like a book where you flip the pages and so forth.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.640
 I also listen to full length audio books.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.620
 However, over time, we know that we forget lots of things.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.820
 And even though sometimes I think

02:16.820 --> 02:19.300
 I got all the critical information from a book,

02:19.300 --> 02:22.220
 when I listen to Blinkist and I get the 15 minute rundown,

02:22.220 --> 02:24.820
 either in audio or in written form,

02:24.820 --> 02:26.400
 what I find is there are key points

02:26.400 --> 02:27.940
 that oftentimes I missed.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.980
 And so it's a great way for me to both jog my memory

02:30.980 --> 02:32.260
 and to bring forward ideas

02:32.260 --> 02:34.360
 that I hadn't considered previously.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.860
 They have thousands of nonfiction titles

02:36.860 --> 02:39.320
 and some really terrific ones in the science category.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.100
 For example, David Eagleman's book, Livewired,

02:42.100 --> 02:44.840
 which came out recently as a book I read in full length form

02:44.840 --> 02:48.000
 and I've listened to the Blinkist version of it as well.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.140
 Livewired is a book about neuroplasticity,

02:50.140 --> 02:53.420
 the brain's ability to change in response to experience.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.300
 I get so many questions and requests

02:55.300 --> 02:57.220
 for books about neuroplasticity.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.140
 In my opinion, Livewired is the most recent and up to date

03:00.140 --> 03:02.340
 and the best one to date.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.420
 So that's there.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.660
 David Sinclair's book, Lifespan.

03:05.660 --> 03:08.220
 David, as many of you know,

03:08.220 --> 03:10.840
 is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.900
 Lifespan is this terrific book about aging as a disease

03:13.900 --> 03:17.540
 and the future and present of longevity treatments.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.860
 Very interesting book.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.180
 As well as Matt Walker's book, Why We Sleep.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.500
 Matt, of course, is a professor at UC Berkeley

03:23.500 --> 03:25.480
 and Why We Sleep is a terrific book

03:25.480 --> 03:27.940
 about why we sleep, the science of sleeping

03:27.940 --> 03:29.620
 and things you can do to improve your sleep.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.360
 All of those are on Blinkist.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.220
 But with Blinkist, you get unlimited access

03:33.220 --> 03:35.820
 to their massive library of nonfiction.

03:35.820 --> 03:37.180

04:05.940 --> 04:08.920
 This episode is also brought to us by Monkpack.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.680
 Monkpack is a company that makes keto friendly snacks

04:12.680 --> 04:14.060
 that taste incredible,

04:14.060 --> 04:17.020
 but have just one gram of sugar or less.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.820
 As I've said before on this podcast,

04:18.820 --> 04:22.040
 I am not in ketosis, I'm not ketogenic.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.980
 I don't advocate or follow any one particular diet.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.940
 For me, what works is to fast in the early part of the day

04:27.940 --> 04:31.560
 and to eat low carb and keto-ish throughout the day.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.980
 That's for alertness and attention so I can work and focus

04:34.980 --> 04:37.340
 and I don't feel sluggish or brain fog.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.060
 And then at night and in the evening

04:39.060 --> 04:41.100
 is when I tend to eat my carbohydrates

04:41.100 --> 04:42.660
 to aid the transition to sleep.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.180
 That's what works for me.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.580
 Monkpack bars are a terrific snack,

04:46.580 --> 04:48.120
 whether or not your keto all the time,

04:48.120 --> 04:50.580
 whether or not you're low carb, or even if you're not,

04:50.580 --> 04:52.320
 they are absolutely delicious.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.740
 And I don't say that lightly.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.840
 I'm not a big fan of bars in general.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.180
 Most bars to me taste like a combination of a metal bumper

05:00.180 --> 05:02.820
 mixed with some cardboard and some lawn trimmings

05:02.820 --> 05:04.140
 and some artificial sugar.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.900
 Monkpack bars, when they were sent to me,

05:05.900 --> 05:06.960
 I was like, all right, I'll try them.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.420
 I tried it like, uh-oh, this is a problem

05:09.420 --> 05:11.140
 because I like them very, very much.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.580
 And when I say it's a problem, it really is a problem.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.660
 I actually keep the Monkpack boxes in my basement

05:16.660 --> 05:18.520
 so that I don't tear through them all at once.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.380
 I'm a huge fan of the caramel sea salt flavor.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.820
 It's delicious, just talking about it.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.200
 It makes me hungry for one.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.180
 But they also have sea salt, dark chocolate,

05:26.180 --> 05:27.880
 peanut butter, dark chocolate.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.000
 They're terrific.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.360
 In addition to being keto friendly,

05:30.360 --> 05:33.660
 they're also gluten-free, plant-based, non-GMO,

05:33.660 --> 05:36.820
 no soy, trans fat, sugar alcohols, or artificial colors.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.380
 So all the bad stuff that you don't want.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.540
 And as I mentioned before,

05:40.540 --> 05:43.420
 their keto less than one gram of sugar.

05:43.420 --> 05:46.540
 If you want to try Monkpack, you can go to monkpack.com.

 to get 20% off your purchase.

06:03.180 --> 06:05.740
 This month, we've been talking all about hormones,

06:05.740 --> 06:08.820
 which are these absolutely incredible chemicals

06:08.820 --> 06:10.660
 in our brain and body.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.540
 They impact our entire lifespan.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.100
 So from the time that we are in the womb,

06:16.100 --> 06:17.460
 they are controlling the development

06:17.460 --> 06:19.500
 of our brain and our bodies.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.420
 After we are born, they're still controlling

06:22.420 --> 06:25.340
 the development of our brain and bodies.

06:25.340 --> 06:26.500
 And I did say development

06:26.500 --> 06:29.220
 and that's because contrary to what most people think,

06:29.220 --> 06:31.980
 development lasts the entire lifespan.

06:31.980 --> 06:35.040
 From the time you're conceived until the time you die,

06:35.040 --> 06:36.720
 you are developing, you are changing,

06:36.720 --> 06:40.600
 and hormones are constantly updating and changing

06:40.600 --> 06:42.700
 the different functions of your body.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.020
 They have two major kinds of effects.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.500
 One are immediate effects.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.620
 So they can actually bind to

06:48.620 --> 06:50.940
 or kind of park in parking spots on cells

06:50.940 --> 06:52.880
 and impact all sorts of things

06:52.880 --> 06:54.860
 like the growth of cells, et cetera.

06:54.860 --> 06:57.300
 They also can control gene expression.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.200
 This is the way that hormones during puberty

06:59.200 --> 07:02.320
 control body hair growth and breast development

07:02.320 --> 07:05.120
 and growth of muscles and limbs and height

07:05.120 --> 07:06.100
 and all sorts of things.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.580
 They are incredible.

07:07.580 --> 07:10.180
 We've talked about testosterone and estrogen.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.720
 We talked about insulin and glucagon

07:12.720 --> 07:13.980
 and some of the other things.

07:13.980 --> 07:17.740
 Today, we are going to talk about metabolism,

07:17.740 --> 07:20.620
 mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone

07:20.620 --> 07:24.300
 and growth hormone and some other related pathways.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.840
 I'm going to explain to you the logic

07:26.840 --> 07:30.140
 of how thyroid hormone and growth hormone work.

07:30.140 --> 07:32.620
 It will become obvious why I've paired

07:32.620 --> 07:36.780
 thyroid and growth hormone together in the same episode.

07:36.780 --> 07:40.680
 And I will of course talk about tools that you can use

07:40.680 --> 07:43.700
 to elevate or reduce thyroid hormone.

07:43.700 --> 07:44.700
 There are cases where people

07:44.700 --> 07:46.580
 want to reduce thyroid hormone.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.140
 I will talk about tools that you can use

07:48.140 --> 07:50.140
 to elevate growth hormone.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.500
 There are rare cases where people

07:51.500 --> 07:52.900
 want to reduce growth hormone.

07:52.900 --> 07:56.360
 Most people are interested in increasing growth hormone.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.740
 So today is going to be rich with information,

07:58.740 --> 08:00.980
 rich with actionable tools.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.060
 And as always, the idea is to spell out

08:04.060 --> 08:05.500
 an organizational logic

08:05.500 --> 08:07.060
 so you can come away from this episode.

08:07.060 --> 08:09.780
 And in fact, the entire month on hormones,

08:09.780 --> 08:12.180
 really understanding at some level

08:12.180 --> 08:14.940
 what these things we call hormones are and how they work.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.580
 And that's really to arm you

08:16.580 --> 08:18.740
 to encounter information going forward,

08:18.740 --> 08:21.020
 whether or not it comes from me or from somebody else,

08:21.020 --> 08:24.060
 a book or a course, someplace else online,

08:24.060 --> 08:27.780
 to make sense of how to work with these incredible chemicals

08:27.780 --> 08:30.000
 we call hormones.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.900
 Before we begin to talk about thyroid and growth hormone

08:32.900 --> 08:37.500
 and how our metabolism works and how to control metabolism,

08:37.500 --> 08:39.140
 I want to answer a few questions

08:39.140 --> 08:42.380
 that I received from you, from the audience.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.240
 Every once in a while,

08:43.240 --> 08:46.540
 someone will send me a quite earnest question

08:46.540 --> 08:49.140
 about something they saw on the internet.

08:49.140 --> 08:52.820
 And one of the things I've heard about quite a bit

08:52.820 --> 08:53.780
 in the last couple of weeks

08:53.780 --> 08:57.480
 is we've been talking about hormones and food intake

08:57.480 --> 08:59.120
 and how those interact,

08:59.120 --> 09:02.620
 is this question of are certain foods

09:02.620 --> 09:06.640
 particularly good for certain organs of the body

09:06.640 --> 09:09.540
 and can that be predicted on the basis

09:09.540 --> 09:12.140
 of the shape of those foods?

09:12.140 --> 09:13.060
 So, first of all,

09:13.060 --> 09:15.760
 I want to acknowledge the question as a valid one

09:15.760 --> 09:18.580
 because I see this every once in a while out there,

09:18.580 --> 09:19.420
 people will say,

09:19.420 --> 09:21.740
 well, walnuts are in the shape of the brain

09:21.740 --> 09:24.420
 and therefore they are good for your brain

09:24.420 --> 09:27.900
 or a particular fruit like the beet

09:27.900 --> 09:30.860
 often looks like a heart and it's good for your heart.

09:30.860 --> 09:34.400
 And I certainly invite questions of all kinds

09:34.400 --> 09:36.140
 provided they are sincere questions.

09:36.140 --> 09:41.140
 However, I am not aware of any science whatsoever

09:41.220 --> 09:44.800
 supporting the idea that the shape of a given food

09:44.800 --> 09:46.620
 or object for that matter

09:46.620 --> 09:51.160
 is relevant to its functional role in the body

09:51.160 --> 09:52.500
 in reference to biology.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.620
 Now, beets contain something

09:54.620 --> 09:55.680
 that we're going to talk about today.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.380
 They contain a substance called arginine,

09:58.380 --> 10:01.540
 which actually can control the dilation of blood vessels

10:01.540 --> 10:02.780
 and arteries.

10:02.780 --> 10:06.580
 So it has some relationship to heart and heart health.

10:06.580 --> 10:10.860
 Walnuts contain various fatty acids that maybe,

10:10.860 --> 10:12.180
 I want to underscore maybe,

10:12.180 --> 10:15.200
 beneficial for certain aspects of brain health,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.980
 but there's no evidence whatsoever

10:17.980 --> 10:20.940
 that the shape of the food itself is relevant.

10:20.940 --> 10:22.740
 And I think what's happened is,

10:22.740 --> 10:24.900
 is that people have gone out there

10:24.900 --> 10:27.340
 and found foods that contain certain substances

10:27.340 --> 10:29.100
 like carrots and vitamin A

10:29.100 --> 10:31.500
 or walnuts and particular fatty acids

10:31.500 --> 10:33.920
 or beets and arginine,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.060
 and they've selected the foods

10:36.060 --> 10:38.380
 that happen to be in the shape of the thing,

10:38.380 --> 10:41.380
 the organ that the particular substance

10:41.380 --> 10:44.420
 like vitamin A or fatty acids and so forth

10:44.420 --> 10:46.540
 might benefit or support.

10:46.540 --> 10:49.340
 But of course, there are many, many other sources

10:49.340 --> 10:53.580
 of these nutrients that don't come from walnuts

10:53.580 --> 10:56.060
 or from beets or from carrots.

10:56.060 --> 10:58.620
 And so I guess the short way to put it

10:58.620 --> 11:02.340
 is that the idea that the shape of some food

11:02.340 --> 11:04.980
 is an indication of whether or not that food

11:04.980 --> 11:06.980
 would be healthy for a particular organ in the body

11:06.980 --> 11:09.580
 is absolutely unfounded.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.540
 I don't know of any evidence for it.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.140
 And I'm not out to quash anybody's great love

11:15.140 --> 11:15.960
 of these foods.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.980
 I enjoy all the foods I just described,

11:17.980 --> 11:21.480
 but the shape of things in the physical universe

11:21.480 --> 11:26.480
 bears very little, if any, relevance to the nutrients

11:26.480 --> 11:31.480
 that it contains and therefore the organs that it supports.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.360
 So thank you for your question.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.380
 But if you see that out there,

11:35.380 --> 11:38.600
 I don't even think you need to tell the person

11:38.600 --> 11:40.880
 who's putting that information out into the world.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.600
 I would just back away slowly.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.480
 One other thing before we move into today's material.

11:46.480 --> 11:51.040
 Last episode, I talked about the problems with emulsifiers

11:51.040 --> 11:52.880
 in highly processed foods

11:52.880 --> 11:54.080
 and the way that they can strip

11:54.080 --> 11:55.840
 the mucosal lining of the gut

11:55.840 --> 11:59.040
 and they can limit the signaling of hormones like CCK

11:59.040 --> 12:01.140
 that can signal to the brain satiety,

12:01.140 --> 12:03.260
 the signal to stop eating.

12:03.260 --> 12:05.360
 And then we got into a discussion

12:05.360 --> 12:07.480
 about artificial sweeteners.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.960
 And I threw out Stevia as an artificial sweetener

12:10.960 --> 12:13.920
 and several people reached out to correct me

12:13.920 --> 12:17.040
 that Stevia is not an artificial sweetener.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.000
 It is a non-caloric sweetener and you are correct.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.920
 I lumped artificial and non-caloric sweeteners together.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.140
 And thanks to many of you that also sent me some references,

12:27.140 --> 12:28.780
 it does not appear that Stevia

12:28.780 --> 12:31.260
 can negatively impact the gut microbiome.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.920
 It does seem unique among non-caloric sweeteners.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.880
 There are probably others out there.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.120
 The other thing that we discussed

12:37.120 --> 12:42.120
 is how Stevia can lead to slight increases in blood glucose

12:42.120 --> 12:44.920
 but can also improve insulin management just slightly,

12:44.920 --> 12:46.320
 probably cancels to zero

12:46.320 --> 12:48.800
 in terms of its impact on blood glucose

12:48.800 --> 12:51.160
 provided it's not at concentrations

12:51.160 --> 12:53.320
 that are super, super sweet.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.440
 Ingestion of anything that's very sweet,

12:55.440 --> 12:57.640
 whether or not it contains calories or not,

12:57.640 --> 13:00.980
 artificial or not, will create an insulin response.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.680
 In fact, just walking past a bakery

13:02.680 --> 13:05.200
 and smelling delicious baked goods

13:05.200 --> 13:08.120
 can increase your insulin secretion.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.260
 And so I just want to point that out.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.960
 Thank you for the information

13:12.960 --> 13:14.220
 and the references that you found.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.480
 Please send additional ones if you do find them.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.440
 And I appreciate that you allow me to make corrections.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.640
 Every once in a while I misspeak here

13:21.640 --> 13:23.080
 and the opportunity to make corrections

13:23.080 --> 13:24.740
 keeps us all on the same page.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.480
 And please do keep any feedback

13:26.480 --> 13:28.200
 that you have about particular things

13:28.200 --> 13:29.760
 I cover here coming my way.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.680
 There is so much interest in metabolism.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.820
 We hear about having a high or a low metabolism.

13:37.660 --> 13:38.880
 There are some people out there

13:38.880 --> 13:41.160
 who would like to reduce their metabolism.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.280
 They simply can't eat enough to maintain their weight.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.800
 Most people, however, struggle with the opposite issue.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.440
 They struggle to maintain a healthy weight

13:50.440 --> 13:53.060
 and or their metabolism is too low.

13:53.060 --> 13:54.480
 Now, there are a variety of reasons

13:54.480 --> 13:56.160
 why metabolism can be low.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.240
 Today, we are going to talk about two hormones,

13:59.240 --> 14:02.440
 thyroid hormone and its related pathways

14:02.440 --> 14:05.760
 and growth hormone and its related pathways,

14:05.760 --> 14:08.520
 which arguably are the two hormones

14:08.520 --> 14:12.060
 and two systems in the body that are most significant

14:12.060 --> 14:15.040
 for setting your overall level of metabolism.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.240
 Before we dive into those,

14:17.240 --> 14:20.880
 I just want to cover a little bit of what metabolism is.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.920
 And I want to talk about which organs in your body

14:23.920 --> 14:25.360
 use the most energy.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.480
 So metabolism is the consumption of energy,

14:28.480 --> 14:29.820
 not necessarily eating,

14:29.820 --> 14:34.080
 but it's the use of energy in the cells of the body

14:34.080 --> 14:37.480
 for growth of tissues, for repair of tissues,

14:37.480 --> 14:41.800
 and also just for day-to-day maintenance of function.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.420
 A good example of maintenance of function

14:43.420 --> 14:44.680
 would be your brain.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.800
 Most of your metabolic needs,

14:46.800 --> 14:49.920
 your so-called basal or resting metabolic needs

14:50.920 --> 14:52.800
 are for your brain, for thinking.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.680
 If you were to just sit in a bed all day

14:54.680 --> 14:56.800
 and do nothing but think,

14:56.800 --> 15:01.560
 that consumes about 75% of your metabolic needs.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.800
 Now, there's also moving around.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.520
 If you have a job that requires a lot of heavy labor

15:07.520 --> 15:09.400
 or lifting things, or you're a new parent

15:09.400 --> 15:10.480
 and you're carrying kids around

15:10.480 --> 15:11.620
 and you're going up and down the stairs

15:11.620 --> 15:16.080
 or back and forth to the refrigerator for formula, et cetera,

15:16.080 --> 15:17.700
 well, then you're burning more energy,

15:17.700 --> 15:18.760
 burning more calories.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.400
 But even if you are very physically active,

15:21.400 --> 15:23.940
 unless you're an ultra marathoner or a marathoner,

15:23.940 --> 15:27.680
 chances are that 75% of your metabolic needs

15:27.680 --> 15:29.520
 are coming just from your brain.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.360
 And that's because neurons consume a lot of energy.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.220
 Neurons, of course, are just the nerve cells of your brain.

15:35.220 --> 15:39.640
 So these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone,

15:39.640 --> 15:42.880
 we think of as related to metabolism of things in the body,

15:42.880 --> 15:45.920
 keeping body fat low and keeping muscles strong

15:45.920 --> 15:48.780
 and tendons strong and repairing themselves, et cetera.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.980
 But they are also key for brain function,

15:51.980 --> 15:54.200
 for the ability to maintain cognitive function

15:54.200 --> 15:55.760
 throughout the lifespan.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.960
 So the big theme I'd like to introduce

15:58.960 --> 16:03.360
 is that metabolism isn't just about losing weight,

16:03.360 --> 16:06.000
 but having a high metabolism provided it's not too high

16:06.000 --> 16:06.840
 is great.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.560
 It means that you will have more lean tissue,

16:08.560 --> 16:12.120
 more bone and muscle and less adipose tissue, fat.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.080
 And we know that that's healthy.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.320
 How much fat and how much muscle?

16:16.320 --> 16:18.040
 Well, that varies and the numbers on this

16:18.040 --> 16:19.200
 are always shifting.

16:19.200 --> 16:24.200
 But in general, muscle and its related tissues

16:25.300 --> 16:28.820
 burns more energy than does adipose tissue or fat.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.440
 And the water in your body doesn't consume any energy.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.320
 So metabolism can be increased simply

16:34.320 --> 16:37.480
 by adding muscle to your body and reducing fat

16:37.480 --> 16:39.500
 or adjusting the ratio of the two.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.480
 But regardless, even if you're not interested

16:41.480 --> 16:43.720
 in changing body composition,

16:43.720 --> 16:46.160
 these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone

16:46.160 --> 16:49.520
 are super important for metabolism of all kinds,

16:49.520 --> 16:51.860
 including tissue repair after injury,

16:51.860 --> 16:54.680
 including maintaining cognitive function and wellbeing

16:54.680 --> 16:56.640
 and the ability to think clearly as you age,

16:56.640 --> 16:58.680
 offsetting dementia and so forth.

16:58.680 --> 17:03.680
 So the big theme here really includes the previous episodes.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.040
 You don't have to have seen those episodes,

17:06.040 --> 17:09.100
 but for the last three episodes and today as well,

17:09.100 --> 17:10.440
 we've been talking about hormones,

17:10.440 --> 17:12.360
 these substances that are released from one location

17:12.360 --> 17:15.140
 in the body that go and act other locations in the body.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.280
 I'm going to tell you how that works

17:16.280 --> 17:17.880
 for thyroid and growth hormone.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.600
 But now that you've heard about testosterone and estrogen

17:20.600 --> 17:24.000
 and you're going to hear about thyroid and growth hormone,

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
 I want you to realize that there's a repeating logic.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.520
 First of all, there are neurons in your brain

17:31.520 --> 17:33.980
 in an area called the hypothalamus,

17:33.980 --> 17:36.160
 which it just means it's below the thalamus, hypo.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.000
 It sits at the base of your brain in the front,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.320
 it's part of the forebrain.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.160
 So it's more or less above the roof of your mouth,

17:41.160 --> 17:42.960
 maybe about a centimeter or so,

17:42.960 --> 17:46.020
 and then about a centimeter forward in most people.

17:46.020 --> 17:51.020
 And neurons in the hypothalamus release hormones

17:51.760 --> 17:54.260
 that are called releasing hormones.

17:54.260 --> 17:58.000
 So we've talked in previous episodes about, for instance,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.560
 gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.160
 So those are little neurons that then signal

18:03.160 --> 18:05.240
 another brain area called the pituitary

18:05.240 --> 18:06.860
 to release other hormones.

18:06.860 --> 18:09.040
 Today, we're going to see this again.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.800
 In the brain, you have neurons

18:11.800 --> 18:16.800
 that release thyrotropin or thyroid-releasing hormone.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.800
 You also have growth hormone-releasing hormone.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.760
 So anytime you hear releasing,

18:21.760 --> 18:25.200
 chances are those are neurons that are in your brain

18:25.200 --> 18:27.200
 and they extend little wires we call axons

18:27.200 --> 18:28.520
 into your pituitary,

18:28.520 --> 18:31.380
 and the pituitary releases a bunch of hormones

18:31.380 --> 18:32.520
 into the bloodstream,

18:32.520 --> 18:34.380
 and the pituitary releases things

18:34.380 --> 18:37.540
 that most often have the name of stimulating hormone

18:37.540 --> 18:39.660
 because they stimulate organs.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.400
 So in keeping with the theme of thyroid hormone,

18:42.400 --> 18:45.500
 you have thyroid-releasing hormone in the brain,

18:45.500 --> 18:49.600
 tells the pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone,

18:49.600 --> 18:52.540
 and then the thyroid, which we'll talk about in a moment,

18:52.540 --> 18:54.440
 releases thyroid hormones.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.960
 In the testosterone and estrogen episode,

18:56.960 --> 18:57.800
 we talked about how you have

18:57.800 --> 18:59.500
 gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.320
 There's the releasing again up in the brain.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.060
 Remember, releasing hormone comes from the brain.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.420
 Then you had things like luteinizing hormone

19:06.420 --> 19:08.020
 and follicle-stimulating hormone,

19:08.020 --> 19:09.360
 which were in the pituitary,

19:09.360 --> 19:11.520
 and those traveled to the ovaries or the testes

19:11.520 --> 19:13.700
 and acted on those tissues, okay?

19:13.700 --> 19:16.680
 So please try and embed this logic.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.500
 If you hear the word releasing hormone,

19:18.500 --> 19:20.120
 it's coming from the brain,

19:20.120 --> 19:22.560
 and that makes it actionable in certain ways

19:22.560 --> 19:24.600
 that we'll return to later.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.760
 In addition, the pituitary is letting go

19:27.760 --> 19:29.320
 of all these hormones into the bloodstream

19:29.320 --> 19:31.480
 that are stimulating different tissues.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.680
 So for thyroid, it's thyroid-stimulating hormone,

19:34.680 --> 19:35.860
 and then it goes to the thyroid,

19:35.860 --> 19:39.160
 and the thyroid is a little butterfly-shaped gland

19:39.160 --> 19:41.200
 that's right around the Adam's apple.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.840
 If you want to see yours,

19:42.840 --> 19:44.760
 not directly because it's got skin over it,

19:44.760 --> 19:47.080
 what you would do is you'd take a sip of water,

19:47.080 --> 19:50.080
 you'd look in the mirror, and you'd swallow.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.320
 And the thing that moves up and down,

19:52.320 --> 19:54.160
 that is your thyroid.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.080
 Now, some people call it your Adam's apple

19:56.080 --> 19:59.800
 because it sits right near this protrusion in the trachea,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.640
 which is the Adam's apple.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.320
 No matter whether or not you're male, female,

20:04.320 --> 20:06.520
 or regardless of what your chromosomal background is,

20:06.520 --> 20:08.400
 everyone has an Adam's apple.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.680
 It tends to be more pronounced,

20:09.680 --> 20:11.480
 and people, they got a surge of testosterone

20:11.480 --> 20:12.340
 early in development

20:12.340 --> 20:15.600
 because it has a testosterone sensitivity to it,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.720
 and that actually controls the timbre,

20:17.720 --> 20:20.200
 the so-called deepness of the voice.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.520
 So the thyroid gland sits right there,

20:23.520 --> 20:25.520
 and it's got four little bumps behind it

20:25.520 --> 20:26.980
 called the parathyroid gland,

20:26.980 --> 20:30.440
 and it releases two hormones into the blood

20:30.440 --> 20:32.760
 to stimulate different tissues and their metabolism,

20:32.760 --> 20:35.400
 and those hormones are called T4 and T3.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.720
 So if this is already sounding like a lot of information,

20:37.720 --> 20:40.020
 it's really easy, I promise.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.480
 Releasing hormone comes from the brain,

20:42.480 --> 20:44.560
 stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary,

20:44.560 --> 20:47.240
 and in this case, we're talking about the thyroid

20:47.240 --> 20:49.620
 binding up that stimulating hormone and saying,

20:49.620 --> 20:50.920
 oh, I need to release something

20:50.920 --> 20:52.900
 that releases T4 and T3, and guess what?

20:52.900 --> 20:54.920
 You can basically forget about T4.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.100
 T4, it's not completely inactive, it has some roles,

20:58.100 --> 21:00.840
 but T3 is the one that's more or less active.

21:00.840 --> 21:04.000
 Now, what does thyroid hormone do?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.560
 A lot of people think, oh, thyroid, it's like metabolism,

21:06.560 --> 21:07.800
 and people who are hypothyroid

21:07.800 --> 21:09.600
 all have bulging eyes and are real thin,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.840
 and people who have hypothyroid are overweight,

21:11.840 --> 21:16.400
 and their eyes are half closed or something,

21:16.400 --> 21:18.780
 and indeed, thyroid hormone controls

21:18.780 --> 21:20.840
 a lot of the features of the face and the eyes,

21:20.840 --> 21:25.120
 and it can control amounts of adipose tissue and so forth,

21:25.120 --> 21:30.120
 but the main role of thyroid hormone, of T3,

21:30.120 --> 21:32.840
 is to promote metabolism,

21:32.840 --> 21:35.920
 and that doesn't just mean the consumption of energy,

21:35.920 --> 21:37.840
 it means the utilization of energy,

21:37.840 --> 21:40.240
 including the buildup of tissues,

21:40.240 --> 21:43.680
 so it acts on all sorts of target tissues in the body.

21:43.680 --> 21:47.340
 It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,

21:47.340 --> 21:51.080
 it acts on the cartilage, it acts on the bone,

21:51.080 --> 21:53.440
 and it's not just involved in using energy,

21:53.440 --> 21:55.000
 it's also converting energy.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.760
 I do realize I said that twice.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.720
 It's involved in taking fats

21:58.720 --> 22:00.960
 and breaking them down into fatty acids

22:00.960 --> 22:03.440
 and converting those into ATP,

22:03.440 --> 22:07.760
 which is an important thing for cells to use energy.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.180
 It's also involved in taking sugars

22:10.180 --> 22:12.120
 and turning those into energy,

22:12.120 --> 22:15.560
 and yes, it goes to adipose tissue, to fat.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.460
 We have different kinds of fat that we'll talk about today,

22:17.460 --> 22:18.520
 but it goes to white fat,

22:18.520 --> 22:21.920
 and it liberates or helps liberate some of the fats

22:21.920 --> 22:25.600
 from those fat cells and use them for energy,

22:25.600 --> 22:26.960
 and this is why higher thyroid

22:26.960 --> 22:29.360
 is associated with leaner bodies.

22:29.360 --> 22:33.400
 Lower thyroid is associated with less lean bodies.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.600
 So one thing that's absolutely key and is actionable,

22:37.600 --> 22:42.360
 we're right there already in discussing tools, is iodine.

22:42.360 --> 22:47.280
 Iodine comes from things in the ocean, right?

22:47.280 --> 22:50.160
 And here are a couple of interesting facts about iodine,

22:50.160 --> 22:51.000
 and then we'll talk about

22:51.000 --> 22:54.960
 whether or not you should be supplementing iodine or not.

22:54.960 --> 22:59.960
 First of all, iodine is most common in sea salt,

23:01.580 --> 23:04.040
 in kelp, and in seaweed,

23:04.040 --> 23:06.960
 and most people can get enough iodine

23:06.960 --> 23:10.720
 from the food they eat and or the table salt they consume.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.600
 Almost all table salt from all over the world,

23:14.600 --> 23:17.060
 regardless of where you are, contains iodine.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.960
 The thyroid needs iodine in order to produce thyroid hormone

23:22.960 --> 23:24.960
 and you need sufficient levels of thyroid hormone.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.180
 Not too much, but you need it.

23:27.180 --> 23:30.540
 So chances are you are getting enough iodine,

23:30.540 --> 23:32.160
 although you might not,

23:32.160 --> 23:33.840
 especially those of you following

23:33.840 --> 23:36.040
 a particularly quote-unquote clean diet

23:36.040 --> 23:38.320
 might not be getting enough iodine.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.720
 Here's the deal with iodine.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.320
 Iodine combines with an amino acid

23:42.320 --> 23:45.400
 that we've talked about before called L-tyrosine.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.680
 L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.840
 There are some plant-based sources as well.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.720
 It is the precursor to dopamine,

23:52.720 --> 23:57.720
 but in the thyroid, iodine combines or works with L-tyrosine

23:58.000 --> 24:01.220
 to produce T3 and T4, the thyroid hormone.

24:01.220 --> 24:04.440
 So you absolutely need sufficient iodine,

24:04.440 --> 24:06.880
 you need sufficient L-tyrosine,

24:06.880 --> 24:08.180
 and then you also need something else

24:08.180 --> 24:09.220
 which is called selenium,

24:09.220 --> 24:11.740
 and we'll talk about selenium in a moment.

24:11.740 --> 24:14.080
 So there's a condition

24:14.080 --> 24:16.440
 that shows up in little pockets in the world.

24:16.440 --> 24:21.440
 It's not super common, meaning it's not very widespread,

24:21.440 --> 24:25.020
 but in certain areas that are far away from the ocean,

24:25.020 --> 24:27.120
 at one point, this was historically

24:27.120 --> 24:30.000
 in the Midwestern states of the United States,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.520
 in some mountain regions of other countries,

24:32.520 --> 24:37.520
 in some areas of Africa that were far from the ocean,

24:38.160 --> 24:42.260
 people would get extremely swollen bulges in their necks,

24:42.260 --> 24:44.520
 and this was called goiter.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.080
 And the reason they were getting those swollen bulges

24:47.080 --> 24:50.680
 is because the thyroid itself was hypertrophy,

24:50.680 --> 24:55.680
 it was growing in an attempt to churn out more thyroid,

24:56.800 --> 25:00.480
 and because it was getting a lot of stimulating hormone

25:00.480 --> 25:02.000
 from the pituitary,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.120
 but, and I don't want to go too far off track here,

25:05.120 --> 25:08.320
 but as you recall, the brain and the pituitary

25:08.320 --> 25:11.040
 are paying attention in a cellular sense

25:11.040 --> 25:12.920
 to the levels of hormones in the blood,

25:12.920 --> 25:14.740
 and when those hormones get too high,

25:14.740 --> 25:16.280
 they shut off the stimulating hormone,

25:16.280 --> 25:17.720
 they shut down the signal to make more,

25:17.720 --> 25:19.000
 kind of like a thermostat.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.760
 When the levels are too low,

25:20.760 --> 25:22.880
 like there's not enough testosterone in the bloodstream,

25:22.880 --> 25:23.980
 or there's not enough estrogen,

25:23.980 --> 25:26.540
 the brain will continue to push out the signal

25:26.540 --> 25:28.120
 to make more.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.640
 Similarly, if there's not enough thyroid circulating,

25:31.640 --> 25:34.240
 or there's not enough iodine to make thyroid,

25:34.240 --> 25:36.880
 therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating,

25:36.880 --> 25:40.480
 the thyroid gland itself is not getting shut down,

25:40.480 --> 25:42.800
 there's tons of stimulating hormone and releasing hormone

25:42.800 --> 25:44.580
 coming from the brain, like release, release, release,

25:44.580 --> 25:46.400
 and there's no way they can make thyroid hormone,

25:46.400 --> 25:48.340
 instead the gland just gets bigger and bigger and bigger,

25:48.340 --> 25:49.880
 and so people get goiter.

25:49.880 --> 25:54.240
 This is one of the reasons why table salt has iodine in it,

25:54.240 --> 25:55.200
 although there are other foods

25:55.200 --> 25:57.420
 that have iodine in it as well.

25:57.420 --> 26:00.360
 So how much iodine do you need?

26:00.360 --> 26:02.400
 Well, you don't need a whole lot.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.140
 Some people who are hypothyroidal might,

26:06.140 --> 26:07.100
 and I want to emphasize might,

26:07.100 --> 26:08.760
 you absolutely should talk to your doctor.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.960
 This is a serious matter.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.120
 Anytime you're talking about hormones

26:12.120 --> 26:13.860
 or manipulating levels of thyroid,

26:13.860 --> 26:15.680
 you absolutely want to talk to your doctor.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.320
 Some people benefit from supplementing iodine.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.920
 It is contained in most salts.

26:19.920 --> 26:23.680
 It's in Himalayan salt, not always, but often.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.960
 I know these days there's a lot of excitement

26:25.960 --> 26:27.600
 about pink salts and sea salts,

26:27.600 --> 26:29.880
 and the kind of artisan salt thing

26:29.880 --> 26:33.420
 has kind of taken off in the foodie land, which is great.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.360
 Some of them are actually quite tasty.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.200
 You can just take it directly if you like the taste of salt,

26:39.200 --> 26:42.280
 but iodine can be supplemented through things like kelp

26:42.280 --> 26:43.920
 and seaweed and kelp tablets.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.960
 Now, if you are hyperthyroidal,

26:45.960 --> 26:48.760
 you make too much thyroid, that actually can be a problem.

26:48.760 --> 26:51.280
 So really the best way to figure this out

26:51.280 --> 26:55.060
 is to get your blood levels tested of thyroid hormone.

26:55.060 --> 26:58.960
 But there's so much iodine in the ocean

26:58.960 --> 27:01.520
 that believe it or not, people that live near the coast

27:01.520 --> 27:03.520
 can actually just absorb it through the air

27:03.520 --> 27:05.320
 just by breathing ocean air.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.480
 So that gives you a sense of just how little iodine

27:08.480 --> 27:10.640
 you actually need to consume in food or in salt.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.260
 So if you're within a few miles of the ocean

27:12.260 --> 27:14.600
 or you visit the ocean from time to time,

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
 you're probably getting plenty.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.520
 It does have to come together, as I mentioned,

27:17.520 --> 27:18.840
 with L-tyrosine.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.740
 And this is why foods that contain L-tyrosine

27:22.700 --> 27:25.960
 and provided that you have sufficient iodine in your diet,

27:26.920 --> 27:30.000
 and if you have sufficient selenium in your diet,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.600
 does serve to increase your metabolism.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.880
 And that is, again, is for the growth and repair of tissues.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.560
 And that's really important.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.520
 It's not just about keeping your metabolism high

27:40.520 --> 27:42.920
 so that you can be on the leaner side of things

27:42.920 --> 27:45.100
 or adjust your body weight, excuse me,

27:45.100 --> 27:47.760
 your body composition ratios the way you like.

27:47.760 --> 27:51.040
 Repair of injuries, repair of brain tissue,

27:51.040 --> 27:52.840
 clearance of any damage from neurons,

27:52.840 --> 27:55.440
 clearance of any damage to the body

27:55.440 --> 27:57.160
 is also going to depend on thyroid.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.840
 Again, metabolism being this kind of rate

27:59.840 --> 28:02.440
 of fuel consumption and use in the body generally,

28:02.440 --> 28:05.960
 not just about body mass indexes and things of that sort.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.800
 So let's talk about selenium because it's really important.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.760
 And even though most people are getting a lot

28:10.760 --> 28:12.740
 of sufficient iodine,

28:13.640 --> 28:17.280
 and most people are probably getting enough L-tyrosine,

28:17.280 --> 28:21.520
 I'm guessing most people may not be getting enough selenium

28:21.520 --> 28:23.800
 if their goal is to increase thyroid hormone,

28:23.800 --> 28:26.060
 at least that's what the literature says.

28:26.060 --> 28:28.480
 Without going into the biochemistry,

28:28.480 --> 28:31.920
 selenium is important in order for thyroid hormone

28:31.920 --> 28:35.960
 to be made because of the way that it allows L-tyrosine

28:35.960 --> 28:39.480
 and iodine to interact.

28:39.480 --> 28:44.120
 And the thing is most people aren't getting enough selenium

28:44.120 --> 28:46.040
 because they don't eat foods that are high in selenium.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.600
 Now, how much selenium you need

28:47.600 --> 28:48.880
 will depend on where you live.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.920
 It actually varies country by country.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.640
 Some countries I found say that you should get

28:54.640 --> 28:58.560
 100 micrograms, some say 200, some say 155.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.720
 The average was about 155 micrograms,

29:00.720 --> 29:02.340
 the countries I looked at.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.740
 People who are trying to increase thyroid levels

29:04.740 --> 29:06.960
 might want to consume more selenium.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.520
 And if you consume a vitamin, of course,

29:08.520 --> 29:11.320
 you want to make sure if it has selenium

29:11.320 --> 29:12.240
 that you're not overdoing it

29:12.240 --> 29:15.080
 by consuming a lot of selenium-rich foods either.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.340
 But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say

29:17.340 --> 29:19.920
 that most people probably could do well

29:19.920 --> 29:23.040
 by ingesting slightly more selenium than they currently are,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.220
 although, of course, always talk to your doctor.

29:26.220 --> 29:28.760
 Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods

29:28.760 --> 29:30.440
 to get selenium from.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.640
 It has very high concentrations of selenium.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.600
 In just six or eight Brazil nuts

29:35.600 --> 29:40.400
 contain something like 550 micrograms of selenium.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.240
 It's also present in fish.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.940
 So certain fish like yellowfin tuna,

29:44.940 --> 29:48.120
 although nowadays, whenever I mention tuna or shellfish,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.860
 which is the other rich source of selenium,

29:50.860 --> 29:53.360
 people will tell me immediately

29:53.360 --> 29:55.200
 there are all sorts of issues around farm,

29:55.200 --> 29:57.120
 not farm, mercury, et cetera.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.200
 So I've never particularly liked eating fish

30:00.200 --> 30:01.600
 because of the way it tastes.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.760
 So that's why I avoid it.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.880
 But for those of you that like it,

30:03.880 --> 30:05.400
 I'm sure you're much more skilled

30:05.400 --> 30:07.200
 in knowing which fish to buy

30:07.200 --> 30:08.600
 and which fish not to buy.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.800
 Ham, of all things, contains a lot of selenium.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.480
 For whatever reason, pork does.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.240
 I'm not a big consumer of pork.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.840
 Beef has some selenium.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.280
 But what's interesting, if you look at the sources,

30:20.280 --> 30:23.160
 pork, beef, turkey, chicken, cottage cheese,

30:23.160 --> 30:28.000
 eggs, brown rice, what you want to understand

30:28.000 --> 30:30.100
 is that Brazil nuts, six to eight Brazil nuts,

30:30.100 --> 30:33.940
 has 550 micrograms of selenium,

30:33.940 --> 30:36.080
 and all the other foods I mentioned

30:36.080 --> 30:37.680
 at much greater portion size

30:37.680 --> 30:40.740
 than equivalent to six to eight Brazil nuts,

30:40.740 --> 30:43.640
 either by volume or by calories,

30:43.640 --> 30:47.520
 they have something like 30 to 50 micrograms of selenium.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.840
 So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,

30:48.840 --> 30:51.400
 and I'm guessing most people aren't,

30:51.400 --> 30:54.120
 and you're not eating a lot of animal-based foods,

30:54.120 --> 30:55.720
 which I know many of you aren't,

30:55.720 --> 30:58.880
 then you're probably not getting enough selenium.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.320
 And again, you can have these levels measured,

31:01.320 --> 31:03.640
 or you can just check what you're consuming

31:03.640 --> 31:06.360
 and figure out whether or not you're meeting the ration

31:06.360 --> 31:09.840
 that you need in order to get healthy levels of thyroid.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.280
 It is present in things like mushrooms,

31:12.280 --> 31:14.880
 but again, in a bowl of mushrooms,

31:15.840 --> 31:17.920
 what is the equivalent to a bowl of mushrooms?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.560
 12 micrograms of selenium.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.160
 And if the daily ration is something

31:21.160 --> 31:23.480
 in the 100 to 200 range,

31:23.480 --> 31:25.160
 again, look it up for the area you are,

31:25.160 --> 31:27.200
 you can see really quickly why,

31:27.200 --> 31:29.200
 even though things like mushrooms and spinach

31:29.200 --> 31:31.040
 and milk and yogurt and lentils and cashews,

31:31.040 --> 31:33.360
 so now we're into the vegetarian segment

31:33.360 --> 31:35.000
 in the list that I constructed,

31:35.000 --> 31:36.720
 you're probably not getting enough selenium.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.920
 So it's kind of an interesting thing

31:38.920 --> 31:40.360
 if you're an experimenter

31:40.360 --> 31:42.120
 and you get the clearance from your doctor,

31:42.120 --> 31:43.920
 you could try increasing your selenium levels

31:43.920 --> 31:46.080
 and see how that impacts your metabolism.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.320
 Again, Brazil nuts are probably going to be

31:48.320 --> 31:52.000
 the most direct way to get sufficient selenium levels,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.160
 but because levels are so high in Brazil nuts,

31:54.160 --> 31:56.680
 it also means that you could overdo it as well.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.660
 I'm not really aware of what the consequences are

32:00.660 --> 32:03.280
 of getting too much selenium,

32:03.280 --> 32:04.960
 although you can get too much of anything

32:04.960 --> 32:07.440
 and I'm guessing those consequences aren't good.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.600
 I also want to mention that for children,

32:10.600 --> 32:13.680
 their daily requirements of selenium are much lower,

32:13.680 --> 32:18.680
 as low as 30 or 40 micrograms for kids 14 years or younger.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.960
 And in some areas, I really want to underscore this,

32:21.960 --> 32:25.100
 the amount of selenium that's recommended daily

32:25.100 --> 32:28.040
 is as low as 55 micrograms.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.980
 So it's not that you should be shooting for thousands

32:30.980 --> 32:34.760
 or even high levels of hundreds of micrograms of selenium.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.280
 And again, that's micrograms, not milligrams.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.600
 So again, look into what you need,

32:38.600 --> 32:40.700
 but if you're somebody who's interested

32:40.700 --> 32:45.700
 in keeping thyroid function healthy and productive,

32:45.700 --> 32:47.760
 then you certainly want to make sure

32:47.760 --> 32:48.920
 you're getting enough iodine,

32:48.920 --> 32:50.760
 you're getting enough selenium

32:50.760 --> 32:52.600
 and you're getting enough l-tyrosine.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.060
 And it's interesting when you start looking

32:54.060 --> 32:56.920
 at the various foods, especially highly processed foods,

32:56.920 --> 32:59.800
 then you start to realize that perhaps many people,

32:59.800 --> 33:01.520
 maybe you, are not.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.800
 Not incidentally, selenium has some other effects on health

33:05.800 --> 33:07.400
 that can be quite positive.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.520
 And even though these don't relate

33:08.520 --> 33:11.360
 to thyroid or growth hormone function specifically,

33:11.360 --> 33:13.280
 I think you might want to know about them

33:13.280 --> 33:15.360
 given that we're on the topic of selenium.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.640
 The first is that there are three studies,

33:17.640 --> 33:21.360
 all of which showed very high efficacy

33:21.360 --> 33:26.360
 for reducing the risk of something called preeclampsia.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.800
 Preeclampsia is seizures that are related

33:30.800 --> 33:32.040
 to blood pressure issues

33:32.040 --> 33:36.200
 during or around the delivery of a new baby.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.840
 And it actually, it's a rare-ish condition,

33:38.840 --> 33:41.360
 but it actually can be quite deadly.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.840
 And so the fact that selenium is important

33:44.840 --> 33:47.800
 for offsetting preeclampsia risk is interesting.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.440
 I don't know the exact mechanism,

33:49.440 --> 33:51.460
 and I'm guessing there are only a few of you out there

33:51.460 --> 33:55.160
 that are either pregnant or thinking of conceiving soon,

33:55.160 --> 33:56.440
 but that's worth noting.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.560
 Obviously, anything related to pregnancy or lactation,

33:59.560 --> 34:02.040
 especially talk to your doctor.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.160
 I'm guessing that selenium

34:03.160 --> 34:05.540
 is probably in a lot of prenatal formulas,

34:05.540 --> 34:10.540
 but that's one clear benefit of having sufficient selenium.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.140
 The other is a reduced prostate cancer risk.

34:13.140 --> 34:16.120
 There's a study showing that having sufficient selenium

34:16.120 --> 34:18.200
 can reduce prostate cancer risk.

34:18.200 --> 34:22.520
 And there is some evidence that if you consume foods

34:22.520 --> 34:25.420
 from areas with soil that's low in selenium,

34:25.420 --> 34:26.760
 that can be a problem.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.860
 And last episode, we talked about all these issues

34:28.860 --> 34:31.960
 related to soil quality,

34:31.960 --> 34:33.320
 things that are making their way into food

34:33.320 --> 34:36.020
 that are disrupting hormones and so forth.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.260
 But having sufficient selenium from food

34:40.260 --> 34:43.600
 could offset the low content in any soil.

34:43.600 --> 34:46.800
 And so that apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.320
 It's a minor effect, but it's a statistically

34:49.320 --> 34:50.160
 significant one.

34:50.160 --> 34:52.440
 And the other one is a reduction in acne,

34:52.440 --> 34:53.280
 which is interesting.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.680
 I'm guessing that that probably has to do

34:55.680 --> 34:57.220
 with the thyroid hormone pathway

34:57.220 --> 35:01.080
 because of the way thyroid hormone can impact the liver.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.880
 And it turns out that the liver

35:02.880 --> 35:07.000
 and various biochemical reactions in the liver

35:07.000 --> 35:08.380
 can impact acne.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.720
 And that's probably an episode all into itself,

35:10.720 --> 35:13.080
 but those are just some additional benefits

35:13.080 --> 35:15.160
 of getting sufficient selenium.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.040
 Okay, so we're already deep into tools

35:17.040 --> 35:20.040
 related to making sure that you have sufficient

35:20.040 --> 35:23.040
 selenium, iodine, and L-tyrosine

35:23.040 --> 35:25.400
 in order to make enough thyroid hormones

35:25.400 --> 35:28.620
 that can support your metabolic processes

35:28.620 --> 35:30.460
 in your liver, your muscles, your tendons,

35:30.460 --> 35:31.320
 for whatever purpose,

35:31.320 --> 35:35.160
 keeping your metabolism high for body composition reasons,

35:35.160 --> 35:39.780
 or for healing, for keeping your brain working well.

35:39.780 --> 35:42.540
 Earlier, I mentioned there are people

35:42.540 --> 35:44.680
 who are following very clean diets.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.640
 So these are people that consume no processed foods.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.720
 Any starch they might eat is going to be

35:49.720 --> 35:51.280
 maybe a rice or a grain,

35:51.280 --> 35:54.880
 or any protein they might consume

35:54.880 --> 35:56.420
 is going to be either from,

35:56.420 --> 35:59.980
 let's hope from humanely raised animal sources,

35:59.980 --> 36:02.460
 or maybe they're pure plant-based.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.300
 Believe it or not,

36:03.300 --> 36:08.300
 those folks are actually very susceptible to low iodine

36:08.900 --> 36:13.720
 because it turns out that diets that are very meat rich

36:13.720 --> 36:15.300
 and don't have many vegetables,

36:15.300 --> 36:18.120
 as well as diets that are very vegetable rich,

36:18.120 --> 36:21.100
 but don't have many meats or salts,

36:22.460 --> 36:25.300
 are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone

36:25.300 --> 36:27.900
 by way of the iodine pathway and other pathways.

36:27.900 --> 36:30.700
 And so let me try and simplify this for you.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.760
 Chances are if people are doing the all meat diet,

36:32.760 --> 36:33.720
 they're not sprinkling,

36:33.720 --> 36:36.540
 they're not wrapping those steaks in seaweed,

36:36.540 --> 36:40.220
 and they may or may not be supplementing with iodine.

36:40.220 --> 36:43.000
 Chances are they're probably consuming iodine salt,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.400
 but their requirements go up

36:45.400 --> 36:46.840
 if they're not consuming vegetables.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.600
 People who are consuming vegetables,

36:48.600 --> 36:49.440
 it's kind of interesting,

36:49.440 --> 36:50.560
 we always hear that we should have

36:50.560 --> 36:52.480
 our cruciferous vegetables,

36:52.480 --> 36:53.700
 and those are so important,

36:53.700 --> 36:56.040
 but they're actually substances,

36:56.040 --> 37:00.760
 compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables

37:00.760 --> 37:03.660
 that can interfere with thyroid hormone function.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.960
 So if you're eating a lot of that stuff,

37:05.960 --> 37:08.640
 a lot of cabbages and just look up your other,

37:08.640 --> 37:10.600
 I think broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable,

37:10.600 --> 37:11.920
 and I won't read off the whole list,

37:11.920 --> 37:13.860
 you could just put into the internet.

37:13.860 --> 37:14.860
 But if you're, you know,

37:14.860 --> 37:16.100
 we're always told to eat a lot

37:16.100 --> 37:18.540
 of the dark leafy green stuff.

37:18.540 --> 37:23.540
 Well, unless that dark leafy green stuff is kelp or seaweed,

37:23.560 --> 37:26.920
 chances are that we're not getting enough iodine

37:26.920 --> 37:29.360
 unless we're adding salt to our food,

37:29.360 --> 37:31.800
 and chances are that we may be lowering

37:31.800 --> 37:33.920
 the total amount of thyroid that we're making,

37:33.920 --> 37:37.920
 as well as the fact that in plant-rich diets,

37:37.920 --> 37:39.680
 it's hard to get enough L-tyrosine.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.240
 And I don't want, you know, I'm not here to inflame

37:42.240 --> 37:45.020
 any of the vegans or the carnivore folks.

37:45.020 --> 37:47.360
 I don't take a stance either way on any of that.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.960
 I'm just learning, trying to report the science.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.720
 The point I want to make is your health is important.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.680
 So if you are purely plant-based

37:54.680 --> 37:56.400
 and you're eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.200
 make sure you're getting enough iodine.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.360
 It does seem like the cruciferous vegetables

38:00.360 --> 38:03.480
 can increase the need for further iodine.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.240
 And same thing if you're purely,

38:05.240 --> 38:07.640
 and you're on this all meat diet or your keto,

38:07.640 --> 38:09.960
 and you're not ingesting many vegetables.

38:09.960 --> 38:13.080
 So I always thought that the cleaner the diet, the better,

38:13.080 --> 38:15.000
 but it turns, and probably that's true

38:15.000 --> 38:19.080
 from the standpoint of, you know, hormone regulation,

38:19.080 --> 38:22.680
 you know, estrogen and testosterone and other hormones,

38:22.680 --> 38:25.460
 the highly processed foods really are terrible.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.040
 There's so much evidence for that.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.720
 The phthalates in plastics and the processed foods

38:30.720 --> 38:31.640
 and the emulsifiers,

38:31.640 --> 38:33.840
 all the stuff we talked about previous episode,

38:33.840 --> 38:38.240
 but it does seem to be that people that are not getting

38:38.240 --> 38:40.160
 enough iodine for whatever reason,

38:40.160 --> 38:43.220
 really need to check out whether or not

38:43.220 --> 38:45.440
 their iodine levels need to be increased

38:45.440 --> 38:48.200
 because of the fact that they are consuming so many plants

38:48.200 --> 38:50.500
 or so many meats, and in some cases,

38:50.500 --> 38:52.720
 plants that actually lower thyroid hormone.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.440
 And not to beat a dead horse or cabbage,

38:55.440 --> 38:58.460
 but there are a number of things that iodine can do

38:58.460 --> 39:00.960
 that are positive, that are sort of,

39:00.960 --> 39:03.140
 they're related to thyroid, not directly.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.560
 They're kind of offshoots of the thyroid pathway.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.960
 They're downstream of it, we would say,

39:07.960 --> 39:10.360
 in terms of how they impact metabolic function.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.480
 One of those is to reduce something called

39:12.480 --> 39:13.880
 C-reactive protein.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.920
 Some of you may have heard of CRP or C-reactive protein.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.960
 C-reactive protein is something that you want to keep

39:18.960 --> 39:20.880
 at modestly low levels.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.360
 It's associated with inflammation

39:22.360 --> 39:23.840
 and various forms of heart disease

39:23.840 --> 39:26.580
 and even eye disease, macular degeneration.

39:26.580 --> 39:30.060
 So it does appear that iodine supplementation

39:30.060 --> 39:32.240
 or getting sufficient iodine from food,

39:32.240 --> 39:37.240
 either works, is associated with reduced levels

39:38.060 --> 39:40.060
 of C-reactive protein in the blood

39:40.060 --> 39:41.580
 and an anti-inflammatory effect.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.960
 And the anti-inflammatory effect brings us back

39:43.960 --> 39:45.760
 to our old friend interleukin-6.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.440
 Remember, there are these inflammatory cytokines.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.140
 They have many, many names

39:50.140 --> 39:52.000
 because there are many, many of them.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.280
 Interleukin-10 is the one that's anti-inflammatory.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.280
 Interleukin-6 is the one that's inflammatory.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.480
 Anytime you see IL-6, that usually means

40:01.480 --> 40:04.660
 that there's an inflammatory response, there's a wound,

40:04.660 --> 40:06.280
 there's inflammation of the brain,

40:06.280 --> 40:09.120
 somebody is either sleep deprived or had a brain injury,

40:09.120 --> 40:11.960
 or they're dealing with some sort of infection,

40:11.960 --> 40:15.080
 IL-6 is kind of a catchall for inflammation.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.040
 And it does appear that iodine supplementation

40:18.040 --> 40:22.100
 can reduce circulating IL-6 associated with inflammation.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.520
 So in that sense, iodine can have

40:24.520 --> 40:26.280
 an anti-inflammatory effect.

40:26.280 --> 40:29.640
 So by now, it should be abundantly clear

40:29.640 --> 40:31.200
 if you care about thyroid hormone,

40:31.200 --> 40:33.920
 if you care about the pathways that it impacts,

40:33.920 --> 40:36.480
 like having a high level of metabolism,

40:36.480 --> 40:39.280
 which I guess if for no other reason is attractive,

40:39.280 --> 40:40.560
 because then you can eat more

40:40.560 --> 40:43.740
 and still maintain a healthy body composition,

40:43.740 --> 40:48.580
 but also for brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair,

40:48.580 --> 40:50.740
 all that stuff, keeping C-reactive protein low,

40:50.740 --> 40:53.440
 keeping IL-6 low, make sure you're getting enough iodine,

40:53.440 --> 40:55.200
 selenium, and L-tyrosine.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.520
 If you're curious how thyroid actually increases metabolism,

40:58.520 --> 40:59.880
 allows you to eat more, et cetera,

40:59.880 --> 41:02.160
 it relates to something we covered last issue,

41:02.160 --> 41:03.640
 which is glucose.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.840
 Remember, when you eat something, blood sugar goes up,

41:05.840 --> 41:08.320
 insulin is secreted from the pancreas,

41:08.320 --> 41:10.440
 and it makes sure that blood glucose doesn't go too high,

41:10.440 --> 41:12.440
 which can damage tissues, or too low,

41:12.440 --> 41:14.100
 which can make you hypoglycemic.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.060
 Thyroid increases glucose uptake by various tissues,

41:19.060 --> 41:21.320
 in particular muscle and bone.

41:21.320 --> 41:23.680
 It actually can increase bone mineral density,

41:23.680 --> 41:26.000
 which is a really good thing as you get older.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.660
 Injuries, when I say older, I mean basically 30 and older,

41:29.660 --> 41:32.800
 the reason you can recover more quickly from injuries

41:32.800 --> 41:36.280
 if you have a healthy thyroid and healthy thyroid pathways

41:36.280 --> 41:38.700
 is because you can consume energy,

41:38.700 --> 41:41.780
 that energy is diverted toward bone repair,

41:41.780 --> 41:43.880
 and muscle repair, and cartilage repair.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.760
 And so the way it does this again is by increasing ATP,

41:47.760 --> 41:52.760
 but the whole idea here is that iodine, selenium,

41:52.920 --> 41:55.400
 L-tyrosine allow thyroid to be at healthy levels

41:55.400 --> 41:58.720
 so that thyroid then can take glucose in the blood

41:58.720 --> 42:01.280
 and divert it to tissues for it to be used,

42:01.280 --> 42:02.540
 in particular your brain,

42:02.540 --> 42:05.360
 and that's why these things that we're talking about

42:05.360 --> 42:07.720
 supplementing or getting from food

42:07.720 --> 42:10.900
 can actually improve or support brain function.

42:10.900 --> 42:11.920
 People are always asking me,

42:11.920 --> 42:14.820
 what is the food that I should eat for my brain?

42:14.820 --> 42:16.440
 Like, are blueberries good for your brain?

42:16.440 --> 42:18.820
 Or they do ask me, are walnuts good for your brain

42:18.820 --> 42:20.200
 because it looks like a brain?

42:20.200 --> 42:21.540
 We talked about that earlier.

42:21.540 --> 42:24.200
 The fact of the matter is that what you need

42:24.200 --> 42:27.820
 are nutrients that support hormones and biological pathways

42:27.820 --> 42:28.720
 that support the brain.

42:28.720 --> 42:29.920
 That's the way to think about it.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.180
 And I realize when people ask,

42:31.180 --> 42:32.640
 what should I eat to support my brain?

42:32.640 --> 42:35.720
 That's basically what they're asking in short form.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.980
 So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy,

42:38.980 --> 42:40.680
 at healthy levels that is,

42:40.680 --> 42:42.480
 is going to be terrific for your brain

42:42.480 --> 42:45.660
 because 75% of your metabolism is from your brain.

42:45.660 --> 42:48.220
 The ability of your brain to use glucose or ketones

42:48.220 --> 42:50.040
 for that matter is going to be aided

42:50.040 --> 42:52.200
 by having healthy thyroid.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.480
 So do the things, take the things,

42:54.480 --> 42:56.360
 eat the things that are going to allow you

42:56.360 --> 42:58.980
 to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone.

42:58.980 --> 43:00.800
 I'm sure a number of you are out there wondering,

43:00.800 --> 43:03.280
 do I have healthy levels of thyroid hormone?

43:03.280 --> 43:04.840
 Those can be measured from the blood.

43:04.840 --> 43:08.520
 There's some telltale signs of having really high thyroid

43:08.520 --> 43:10.160
 or really low thyroid.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.560
 And I could start listing those off.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.560
 They're easy to find online as well.

43:13.560 --> 43:17.320
 Things like bulging eyes, inability to maintain weight,

43:17.320 --> 43:20.620
 shaky, anxiety, that's kind of hyperthyroidal,

43:20.620 --> 43:22.520
 thinning of hair, this kind of thing.

43:22.520 --> 43:26.720
 I don't want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism

43:26.720 --> 43:27.840
 and hyperthyroidism.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.300
 It's just impossible because you're there and I'm here

43:30.300 --> 43:31.540
 and we're kind of shouting back and forth

43:31.540 --> 43:34.400
 through a tunnel of video and comments.

43:34.400 --> 43:37.140
 If you're concerned about having excessively high

43:37.140 --> 43:39.600
 or excessively low levels of thyroid hormone,

43:39.600 --> 43:41.980
 absolutely look up what the symptoms are,

43:41.980 --> 43:43.880
 talk to your physician.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.580
 And there are a number of good treatments.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.360
 I didn't talk about prescription drugs

43:47.360 --> 43:51.740
 that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyperthyroid.

43:51.740 --> 43:55.180
 Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.

43:55.180 --> 43:57.700
 So if you don't make enough thyroid, you can take thyroid.

43:57.700 --> 43:59.140
 It's by prescription.

43:59.140 --> 44:01.180
 If you have too much thyroid,

44:01.180 --> 44:03.640
 sometimes they'll take out the thyroid gland

44:03.640 --> 44:05.580
 or they can administer drugs

44:05.580 --> 44:07.900
 that will either block receptors

44:07.900 --> 44:10.120
 or will interfere with some of the pathways

44:10.120 --> 44:12.100
 from the brain to the pituitary

44:12.100 --> 44:13.980
 or from the pituitary to the thyroid

44:13.980 --> 44:16.740
 in order to adjust thyroid hormone that way.

44:16.740 --> 44:21.100
 So there are the big guns in terms of the treatments

44:21.100 --> 44:23.100
 for different thyroid disorders,

44:23.100 --> 44:25.020
 but we're not talking about thyroid disorders.

44:25.020 --> 44:26.540
 We're talking about how to get

44:26.540 --> 44:29.340
 and maintain thyroid levels in healthy ranges

44:29.340 --> 44:31.300
 and some straightforward ways to do that

44:31.300 --> 44:33.740
 through diet and supplementation.

44:33.740 --> 44:35.140
 There's also a lot of evidence

44:35.140 --> 44:36.460
 that for people who menstruate,

44:36.460 --> 44:38.940
 levels of thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically

44:38.940 --> 44:40.540
 across the menstrual cycle.

44:40.540 --> 44:43.820
 So that's really going to be a process of experimentation.

44:43.820 --> 44:47.460
 I don't know that you could, in theory,

44:47.460 --> 44:50.280
 take blood at different phases of your cycle

44:50.280 --> 44:52.080
 and figure out whether or not your thyroid hormone

44:52.080 --> 44:53.240
 was excessively high or low

44:53.240 --> 44:54.660
 at different phases of the cycle.

44:54.660 --> 44:56.520
 That's going to be pretty tough to do

44:56.520 --> 44:57.940
 if you have an endocrinologist

44:57.940 --> 45:00.380
 that's willing to do that with you, terrific.

45:00.380 --> 45:02.700
 I think most people are going to have to figure out

45:02.700 --> 45:04.620
 how supplementing the sorts of things

45:04.620 --> 45:07.100
 that we talked about before or getting them from foods

45:07.100 --> 45:09.340
 relates to different aspects of their cycle.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.260
 In general, the first half of the cycle before ovulation,

45:12.260 --> 45:15.620
 people create carbohydrates and sweets more related to the,

45:15.620 --> 45:17.460
 and that makes total sense

45:17.460 --> 45:20.340
 based on the biology of the menstrual cycle.

45:20.340 --> 45:23.760
 Thyroid hormone is going to go up as you,

45:23.760 --> 45:26.820
 as anyone, male or female, menstruating or not,

45:26.820 --> 45:29.520
 increases more starchy carbohydrates.

45:29.520 --> 45:32.340
 This is interesting because ketogenic diets

45:32.340 --> 45:34.620
 have been shown to slightly lower thyroid levels.

45:34.620 --> 45:37.940
 And that makes sense because in ketogenic diets,

45:37.940 --> 45:40.180
 blood glucose levels are very low

45:40.180 --> 45:43.900
 and thyroid hormone is secreted in large part

45:43.900 --> 45:48.060
 in proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream

45:48.060 --> 45:51.760
 and how much that glucose needs to be regulated.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.020
 So I'm not trying to demonize the ketogenic diet.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.380
 I think it definitely has its place.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.980
 There are 22 studies now showing

45:58.980 --> 46:01.900
 that it can dramatically reduce blood glucose.

46:01.900 --> 46:03.700
 And about a third of those show

46:03.700 --> 46:07.100
 that thyroid hormone levels are slightly reduced,

46:07.100 --> 46:10.800
 sometimes significantly, if not more,

46:10.800 --> 46:12.500
 in the ketogenic diet.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.980
 That may explain, I want to highlight,

46:14.980 --> 46:17.820
 may explain the fact that when people go back

46:17.820 --> 46:19.280
 to a more traditional diet,

46:19.280 --> 46:22.660
 if they've been on a ketogenic diet for a long time,

46:22.660 --> 46:25.960
 that oftentimes they will gain weight very quickly

46:25.960 --> 46:28.600
 as they bring carbohydrates back into their diet.

46:28.600 --> 46:31.220
 Some people are cycling between ketogenic and non-ketogenic

46:31.220 --> 46:33.500
 every three, four days, so-called cyclic ketogenic diet.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.780
 Some people are staying ketogenic for long periods of time.

46:35.780 --> 46:37.420
 Some people, six days on, one day off.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.700
 So there's a huge variation there.

46:39.700 --> 46:43.340
 The point is that carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates

46:43.340 --> 46:45.820
 in particular, support the healthy production

46:45.820 --> 46:47.500
 of T3 and T4.

46:47.500 --> 46:50.500
 And so if you're very low carbohydrate,

46:50.500 --> 46:53.220
 you're going to have a reduction in T3 and T4.

46:53.220 --> 46:55.180
 And so if you're going to bring carbohydrates

46:55.180 --> 46:56.320
 back into your diet,

46:56.320 --> 46:57.760
 then you might want to do it more gradually.

46:57.760 --> 46:59.380
 And for those of you that menstruate

46:59.380 --> 47:01.520
 and are craving carbohydrates

47:01.520 --> 47:02.700
 in the early part of the cycle,

47:02.700 --> 47:05.940
 that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle.

47:05.940 --> 47:10.020
 If any of you have had a healthy cycle on a ketogenic diet,

47:10.020 --> 47:10.860
 that would be interesting.

47:10.860 --> 47:12.460
 Maybe let me know through the comments

47:12.460 --> 47:14.400
 or point me in the direction of some research

47:14.400 --> 47:15.500
 if you're aware of it.

47:15.500 --> 47:16.420
 So as you can start to see,

47:16.420 --> 47:18.080
 there's this really beautiful interplay

47:18.080 --> 47:19.200
 between the different hormones,

47:19.200 --> 47:21.020
 between insulin and glucose,

47:21.020 --> 47:23.800
 between estrogen and thyroid,

47:23.800 --> 47:28.240
 between thyroid and blood glucose and the ketogenic diets.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.740
 It all starts to fit together

47:29.740 --> 47:31.560
 in ways that make a lot of sense

47:31.560 --> 47:33.640
 once you understand just kind of the core elements

47:33.640 --> 47:34.700
 of what the hormones are

47:34.700 --> 47:36.980
 and the variety of tissues that they work on.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.380
 The simple version of this is

47:38.380 --> 47:41.380
 if you haven't had a carbohydrate for a year,

47:41.380 --> 47:44.860
 then your T3, T4 levels are going to be pretty low.

47:44.860 --> 47:46.660
 And I'm sure there's some ketonistas out there.

47:46.660 --> 47:47.500
 They're going to say,

47:47.500 --> 47:50.040
 wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go up with keto.

47:50.040 --> 47:52.640
 That might be true for other reasons,

47:52.640 --> 47:55.620
 indirect reasons related to hormone pathways

47:55.620 --> 47:58.220
 that are cascade from being in ketosis

47:58.220 --> 48:00.000
 for long periods of time, great.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.660
 But for most people that don't consume any carbohydrate,

48:02.660 --> 48:04.240
 T3, T4 are going to go down.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.480
 And when they start to consume foods

48:06.480 --> 48:08.920
 that require thyroid metabolism

48:08.920 --> 48:11.680
 in order to work with, to metabolize,

48:11.680 --> 48:14.820
 then weight gain can sometimes happen more quickly.

48:14.820 --> 48:16.500
 So it's just something to consider

48:16.500 --> 48:19.820
 and it's something to work with carefully

48:19.820 --> 48:23.260
 if you're going to be cyclic ketogenic, long-term ketogenic.

48:23.260 --> 48:24.480
 And if you're not ketogenic

48:24.480 --> 48:27.020
 and you're consuming carbohydrates

48:27.020 --> 48:29.460
 and the three things that we talked about earlier,

48:29.460 --> 48:31.540
 selenium, tyrosine, and iodine,

48:31.540 --> 48:35.180
 chances are, unless there's an underlying condition there,

48:35.180 --> 48:36.340
 that your levels of thyroid

48:36.340 --> 48:38.180
 are going to be in healthy range.

48:38.180 --> 48:41.100
 Next, we're going to talk about growth hormone.

48:41.100 --> 48:43.740
 Growth hormone has received a ton of attention

48:43.740 --> 48:45.060
 in the last 20 years.

48:45.060 --> 48:47.300
 I actually remember when it was first sequenced.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.140
 This was a huge deal.

48:48.140 --> 48:50.580
 There was a huge patent drama.

48:50.580 --> 48:52.780
 I won't mention the universities or the people involved.

48:52.780 --> 48:56.300
 There were companies and monster patents and payouts,

48:56.300 --> 48:57.700
 and it was really interesting.

48:57.700 --> 48:59.200
 You can look that up online

48:59.200 --> 49:01.660
 if you're interested in some of the scientific history.

49:01.660 --> 49:04.460
 Growth hormone is a pretty straightforward one

49:04.460 --> 49:05.460
 for you to understand now

49:05.460 --> 49:09.260
 because it follows the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.

49:09.260 --> 49:12.740
 In fact, their functions are so closely overlapping

49:13.780 --> 49:15.820
 when we first look at the face of it

49:15.820 --> 49:17.020
 that you're probably going to think,

49:17.020 --> 49:18.660
 why do you have these two systems?

49:18.660 --> 49:23.660
 So just very briefly, growth hormone releasing hormone,

49:23.860 --> 49:25.820
 so remember, releasing means it comes from the brain,

49:25.820 --> 49:26.900
 comes from the brain,

49:26.900 --> 49:29.580
 and tells the pituitary to release growth hormone,

49:29.580 --> 49:31.740
 and then growth hormone is released into the bloodstream

49:31.740 --> 49:34.020
 where it goes and acts on a ton of tissues,

49:34.020 --> 49:38.380
 muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et cetera,

49:38.380 --> 49:39.940
 to increase metabolism.

49:39.940 --> 49:43.420
 It sounds just like thyroid hormone,

49:43.420 --> 49:44.780
 and they do work in parallel,

49:44.780 --> 49:46.020
 and that's why we've lumped them together

49:46.020 --> 49:46.860
 in the same episode.

49:46.860 --> 49:50.420
 They increase metabolism and repair and growth of tissues.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.740
 A conversation about growth hormone would be incomplete

49:54.740 --> 49:56.620
 if we didn't talk about the kind of extremes.

49:56.620 --> 49:58.140
 There are certain people who are born

49:58.140 --> 50:00.200
 that don't make enough growth hormone,

50:00.200 --> 50:03.060
 and they end up very short in stature.

50:03.060 --> 50:05.920
 There are certain people who make a ton of growth hormone,

50:05.920 --> 50:07.860
 and they end up very, very large.

50:07.860 --> 50:10.140
 They tend to have very large appendages.

50:10.140 --> 50:12.160
 They have something called acromegaly.

50:12.160 --> 50:15.700
 It's kind of like a ridging of the forehead.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.700
 It's actually a bone ridge.

50:17.700 --> 50:21.380
 They are giant, and it used to be called giantism,

50:21.380 --> 50:26.260
 and most people, of course, are in a range of height

50:26.260 --> 50:28.140
 and appendage length.

50:28.140 --> 50:29.220
 That doesn't imply

50:29.220 --> 50:31.900
 that there's a growth hormone disruption there.

50:31.900 --> 50:34.680
 Growth hormone received a lot of attention

50:34.680 --> 50:36.140
 after it was sequenced,

50:36.140 --> 50:39.980
 because that meant the opportunity to inject growth hormone

50:39.980 --> 50:41.860
 and replace growth hormone that was lost,

50:41.860 --> 50:43.860
 and there was actually a lot of cases

50:43.860 --> 50:46.380
 of people taking their kids

50:46.380 --> 50:49.700
 and trying to get them to be taller for whatever reason

50:49.700 --> 50:51.740
 by injecting growth hormone.

50:51.740 --> 50:53.360
 Today, we're going to talk about the things

50:53.360 --> 50:56.060
 that anyone can do to increase growth hormone,

50:56.060 --> 50:57.220
 and there are reasons why

50:57.220 --> 50:58.540
 certain people would want to do that.

50:58.540 --> 51:00.100
 People who overproduce growth hormone

51:00.100 --> 51:01.360
 certainly would not want to do that.

51:01.360 --> 51:05.340
 People who underproduce it would probably want to do that.

51:05.340 --> 51:08.680
 People that make normal, quote-unquote,

51:08.680 --> 51:12.400
 levels of growth hormone might want to do that as they age,

51:12.400 --> 51:14.920
 because during puberty and development,

51:14.920 --> 51:17.780
 the pituitary is churning out tons of growth hormone.

51:17.780 --> 51:20.780
 It's responsible for the growth, not surprising,

51:20.780 --> 51:23.540
 of the body and all its features,

51:23.540 --> 51:26.180
 height just being one of those.

51:26.180 --> 51:29.020
 And so as we age, we make less growth hormone,

51:29.020 --> 51:31.000
 and that is one of the reasons

51:31.000 --> 51:34.180
 why we recover more slowly from injuries.

51:34.180 --> 51:37.540
 It's one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat,

51:37.540 --> 51:40.220
 and it's one of the reasons why our metabolism slows.

51:40.220 --> 51:42.740
 And so growth hormone replacement therapy

51:42.740 --> 51:46.620
 has been tremendously popular in the last 20 years,

51:46.620 --> 51:49.500
 which is not to say it doesn't carry its problems, it does.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.200
 Here's one of the major problems

51:51.200 --> 51:53.460
 with injecting growth hormone.

51:53.460 --> 51:54.900
 Not saying people shouldn't do this

51:54.900 --> 51:56.300
 if the doctor has approved it

51:56.300 --> 51:59.980
 or it's in keeping with their particular life goals,

51:59.980 --> 52:04.400
 but growth hormone, if it's in levels that are too high,

52:05.420 --> 52:07.500
 will cause growth of all tissues.

52:07.500 --> 52:11.100
 So not just muscle, not just reduction in body fat

52:11.100 --> 52:15.540
 by metabolizing, by allowing fatty acids

52:15.540 --> 52:18.140
 to be pulled out of storage and used for ATP,

52:18.140 --> 52:22.220
 but it will also cause increase in growth of the heart

52:22.220 --> 52:24.620
 and the lungs and the liver and the spleen.

52:24.620 --> 52:28.060
 And so this is the concern with abuse of growth hormone.

52:28.060 --> 52:28.900
 So we're not going to be talking

52:28.900 --> 52:30.100
 about abuse of growth hormone.

52:30.100 --> 52:33.660
 We will, however, talk about tools that anyone can use

52:33.660 --> 52:35.860
 to increase levels of growth hormone.

52:35.860 --> 52:36.900
 Some of them are behavioral,

52:36.900 --> 52:38.580
 some of them are supplement-based,

52:38.580 --> 52:42.260
 and some of them interact with behaviors and supplements.

52:42.260 --> 52:45.340
 And what's cool about the discussion about growth hormone

52:45.340 --> 52:47.740
 is that the tools that exist out there

52:47.740 --> 52:50.900
 to increase growth hormone are very actionable.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.340
 Most people can do these without the need for any equipment

52:53.340 --> 52:54.380
 or even any supplement,

52:54.380 --> 52:57.860
 although there are some supplement-related themes

52:57.860 --> 53:00.040
 for tools for growth hormone increase.

53:00.040 --> 53:03.620
 And also the increases that one can get in growth hormone

53:03.620 --> 53:05.180
 are substantial.

53:05.180 --> 53:07.460
 So normally when you talk about the difference

53:07.460 --> 53:10.300
 between taking something as an exogenous substance

53:11.260 --> 53:12.840
 like testosterone or estrogen

53:12.840 --> 53:15.820
 versus using supplements or behaviors to increase them,

53:15.820 --> 53:18.220
 you're talking about tenfold differences

53:18.220 --> 53:20.940
 from administering the prescription compound.

53:21.860 --> 53:22.880
 In terms of growth hormone,

53:22.880 --> 53:24.940
 there are things that can increase growth hormone

53:24.940 --> 53:29.060
 three, four, 500% or more.

53:29.060 --> 53:32.180
 And even though that's a short-lived increase,

53:32.180 --> 53:34.440
 they can have very powerful effects on metabolism

53:34.440 --> 53:35.820
 and on repair of tissues.

53:35.820 --> 53:37.460
 So let's talk about those.

53:37.460 --> 53:39.460
 Okay, let's go step-by-step

53:39.460 --> 53:41.660
 in terms of the things that anyone,

53:41.660 --> 53:43.140
 perhaps everyone should be doing

53:43.140 --> 53:45.980
 in order to maintain healthy growth hormone levels

53:45.980 --> 53:48.180
 or increase growth hormone levels.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.220
 Unless you have overproduction of growth hormone,

53:51.220 --> 53:54.280
 chances are these things are going to benefit you.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.960
 However, as always, I want to emphasize,

53:57.960 --> 54:00.700
 talk to a doctor before you do anything,

54:00.700 --> 54:03.300
 including remove any treatments.

54:03.300 --> 54:06.100
 So anything you would add or take away,

54:06.100 --> 54:09.220
 that's a responsibility of you and your healthcare provider.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.780
 Okay, I don't just say that to protect me,

54:10.780 --> 54:12.900
 I say that to protect you.

54:12.900 --> 54:15.700
 First of all, growth hormone is released

54:15.700 --> 54:17.540
 every night when you go to sleep,

54:17.540 --> 54:20.140
 and it's released in the early part of sleep

54:20.140 --> 54:22.040
 during so-called slow wave sleep.

54:23.020 --> 54:25.760
 So the two conditions that have to be met

54:25.760 --> 54:29.160
 in order for growth hormone to be secreted regularly

54:29.160 --> 54:31.580
 for tissue repair, et cetera,

54:31.580 --> 54:34.580
 are you need to get into slow wave sleep,

54:34.580 --> 54:36.500
 the so-called deep sleep,

54:36.500 --> 54:41.500
 and you need blood insulin and glucose to be relatively low.

54:41.760 --> 54:45.180
 So eating within two hours of sleep, excuse me,

54:45.180 --> 54:47.260
 eating within two hours of going to sleep

54:47.260 --> 54:49.160
 is going to suppress growth hormone release.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.660
 That's very clear.

54:50.660 --> 54:52.920
 However, some people are going to have problems

54:52.920 --> 54:55.420
 falling asleep if they are too hungry.

54:55.420 --> 54:56.940
 So you have to work with that

54:56.940 --> 54:59.480
 and decide what you're going to eat

54:59.480 --> 55:01.380
 and when you're going to eat that thing

55:01.380 --> 55:02.600
 so that you're not so hungry

55:02.600 --> 55:04.820
 that you're having trouble falling asleep.

55:04.820 --> 55:06.620
 The episodes on sleep that were covered

55:06.620 --> 55:08.020
 in episodes two, three, and four

55:08.020 --> 55:09.740
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast

55:09.740 --> 55:11.300
 has, I believe, more tools there

55:11.300 --> 55:13.900
 than you could ever want or make use of

55:13.900 --> 55:15.420
 in terms of how to optimize sleep.

55:15.420 --> 55:17.580
 So you can refer to those if you like.

55:17.580 --> 55:19.800
 So don't eat too close to sleep

55:19.800 --> 55:21.380
 and then get into slow wave sleep.

55:21.380 --> 55:24.300
 And as I talked about in one of those earlier episodes,

55:24.300 --> 55:25.780
 the first half of the night,

55:25.780 --> 55:28.340
 slow wave sleep and deep sleep predominate.

55:28.340 --> 55:29.220
 The second half of the night,

55:29.220 --> 55:31.860
 it's another kind of sleep we call REM sleep.

55:31.860 --> 55:36.020
 So what is special about this early phase of sleep?

55:36.020 --> 55:37.340
 This is how you should be thinking

55:37.340 --> 55:39.180
 if you listen to this podcast.

55:39.180 --> 55:40.000
 You should be thinking,

55:40.000 --> 55:41.940
 okay, I hear that something is important,

55:41.940 --> 55:43.540
 it's related, it's in the pathway,

55:43.540 --> 55:46.660
 but mechanistically, when we say get into slow wave sleep,

55:46.660 --> 55:48.020
 get into deep sleep,

55:48.020 --> 55:49.940
 that's when growth hormone is secreted.

55:49.940 --> 55:51.700
 The question you should be asking yourselves

55:51.700 --> 55:55.760
 as scientists of yourselves is,

55:55.760 --> 55:57.640
 wait, why slow wave sleep?

55:57.640 --> 56:01.440
 What in particular about slow wave deep sleep

56:01.440 --> 56:04.340
 allows the pituitary to release growth hormone?

56:04.340 --> 56:06.380
 Like what is it?

56:06.380 --> 56:08.240
 Because if you can understand that,

56:08.240 --> 56:10.440
 if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,

56:10.440 --> 56:12.760
 there are actually ways that you can increase

56:12.760 --> 56:15.780
 the amount of growth hormone that you release

56:15.780 --> 56:18.220
 both in sleep and out of sleep.

56:18.220 --> 56:22.580
 So the answer is it's a delta wave activity in the brain.

56:22.580 --> 56:26.280
 Delta waves are these big giant waves of activity

56:26.280 --> 56:29.900
 in the brain that correlate with slow wave sleep,

56:29.900 --> 56:31.500
 as opposed to faster waves of activity

56:31.500 --> 56:34.420
 that is associated with rapid eye movement sleep.

56:34.420 --> 56:37.760
 So slow wave sleep and the delta activity

56:37.760 --> 56:40.760
 actually triggers the neurons in the brain,

56:40.760 --> 56:42.540
 the releasing hormone, right?

56:42.540 --> 56:44.340
 Growth hormone releasing hormone neurons

56:44.340 --> 56:46.020
 to signal to the pituitary.

56:46.020 --> 56:47.280
 Now, how do I know this is true?

56:47.280 --> 56:48.180
 And what can you do with this?

56:48.180 --> 56:50.460
 Well, we know this is true because researchers

56:50.460 --> 56:52.340
 have taken people and sleep deprived them

56:52.340 --> 56:54.060
 and they just asked,

56:54.060 --> 56:57.060
 well, is it just one period of time every 24 hours

56:57.060 --> 56:59.220
 and then the pituitary releases growth hormone?

56:59.220 --> 57:00.460
 If that were the case,

57:00.460 --> 57:02.640
 that would say that growth hormone is just released

57:02.640 --> 57:06.340
 in a so-called circadian dependent way every 24 hours,

57:06.340 --> 57:07.540
 there's the pulse of it.

57:07.540 --> 57:11.260
 But no, it's always relating to slow wave deep sleep

57:11.260 --> 57:12.380
 and delta waves.

57:12.380 --> 57:14.860
 And this is cool because what it means is that

57:14.860 --> 57:16.980
 even if you're not measuring your brain waves during sleep,

57:16.980 --> 57:19.440
 which most of you probably are not,

57:19.440 --> 57:21.580
 you might be measuring slow wave sleep or deep sleep

57:21.580 --> 57:24.180
 using a device like a whoop or an aura.

57:24.180 --> 57:26.180
 And even if you're not,

57:26.180 --> 57:29.460
 what this means is that during the day,

57:29.460 --> 57:32.180
 there's the potential to also increase

57:32.180 --> 57:34.460
 growth hormone release if you can get the brain

57:34.460 --> 57:36.420
 into the so-called delta waves.

57:36.420 --> 57:38.900
 And it turns out there are things you can do in waking

57:38.900 --> 57:41.260
 as well to increase growth hormone release.

57:41.260 --> 57:42.860
 So we're going to talk about those next,

57:42.860 --> 57:45.260
 but as a tool and to just really make sure

57:45.260 --> 57:47.180
 that we put brackets around this,

57:47.180 --> 57:49.340
 try and have blood glucose not too high.

57:49.340 --> 57:50.820
 So if you do need to eat close to bed,

57:50.820 --> 57:51.980
 you wouldn't want to eat anything

57:51.980 --> 57:54.580
 that would increase blood glucose too much.

57:54.580 --> 57:57.040
 Try and not eat too close to bedtime,

57:57.040 --> 57:58.980
 get into deep sleep early in the night,

57:58.980 --> 58:00.940
 get the growth hormone release,

58:00.940 --> 58:03.940
 and understand that it's the delta waves of activity,

58:03.940 --> 58:06.140
 these sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons

58:06.140 --> 58:08.860
 that stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary.

58:08.860 --> 58:10.540
 Because once you understand that,

58:10.540 --> 58:13.080
 then you have something to anchor to in terms of thinking,

58:13.080 --> 58:15.780
 what are the things I can do in waking

58:15.780 --> 58:18.160
 that will allow me to release more growth hormone,

58:18.160 --> 58:20.940
 which for most people is going to be a good thing.

58:20.940 --> 58:23.580
 Several times before on this podcast,

58:23.580 --> 58:25.900
 I've talked about the fact that I'm not a big fan

58:25.900 --> 58:30.220
 of melatonin supplementation for most purposes.

58:30.220 --> 58:33.360
 It might be helpful under conditions of jet lag.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.900
 However, there are a lot of reasons

58:35.900 --> 58:38.240
 why I personally don't like melatonin.

58:38.240 --> 58:40.980
 It interacts with the reproductive hormones,

58:40.980 --> 58:42.380
 testosterone and estrogen,

58:42.380 --> 58:45.500
 and that whole axis in ways that are unattractive,

58:45.500 --> 58:48.740
 at least to me, it suppresses puberty during development.

58:48.740 --> 58:53.060
 It's present in much, much higher doses in most supplements

58:53.060 --> 58:57.200
 than one would normally make, like 100 fold, 300 fold.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.200
 However, today I'm going to talk about an instance

59:00.200 --> 59:03.840
 where very low levels of melatonin supplementation

59:03.840 --> 59:06.140
 might actually be advantageous.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.860
 And that is aiding the transition

59:08.860 --> 59:12.020
 to the delta wave slow wave sleep I just described,

59:12.020 --> 59:13.980
 because that's the pattern of sleep

59:13.980 --> 59:17.900
 and brainwave activity that triggers growth hormone release.

59:17.900 --> 59:21.500
 So whereas most melatonin supplements are one milligram,

59:21.500 --> 59:24.880
 three milligrams, 12 milligrams, this kind of thing,

59:24.880 --> 59:27.300
 that is super physiological.

59:27.300 --> 59:30.260
 There are some data showing that microgram,

59:30.260 --> 59:35.260
 maybe 500 micrograms of melatonin, so half a milligram,

59:36.360 --> 59:38.940
 can be beneficial in shifting the pattern

59:38.940 --> 59:39.960
 of early night sleep

59:39.960 --> 59:43.620
 toward more of the slow wave deep sleep delta activity

59:43.620 --> 59:45.900
 and improving growth hormone release.

59:45.900 --> 59:49.580
 Not a lot of studies, but the ones that I saw are quality.

59:49.580 --> 59:52.180
 They were done in subjects that, you know,

59:52.180 --> 59:55.620
 both sexes, sufficient numbers, et cetera.

59:55.620 --> 59:56.540
 So this is interesting.

59:56.540 --> 59:59.980
 So if you're interested in melatonin supplementation,

59:59.980 --> 1:00:03.820
 you might think about it just at very low levels, you know,

1:00:03.820 --> 1:00:06.960
 hundreds of micrograms as opposed to the milligram dosages.

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:08.400
 Most of the ones out there

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:10.260
 are going to be in milligram dosages.

1:00:10.260 --> 1:00:14.620
 So that's one way that some studies have shown

1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:17.040
 that you can increase the amount of growth hormone

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:19.940
 that's secreted in early phases of sleep.

1:00:19.940 --> 1:00:21.660
 Now, the delta wave activity

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:24.260
 and the slow wave activity in the brain

1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:27.340
 being very important for growth hormone release

1:00:27.340 --> 1:00:29.380
 and growth hormone release being so important

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:33.360
 for metabolic functions and peeling away unwanted body fat

1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:36.860
 and repairing tissues, et cetera, forces us to ask,

1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:39.380
 well, what other things can we do in waking

1:00:39.380 --> 1:00:41.940
 in order to increase growth hormone release?

1:00:41.940 --> 1:00:43.060
 So let's start with the ones

1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:46.480
 that have a potentially big effect,

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:48.340
 but are a little bit harder to access.

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:51.180
 And for that, I want to point toward a book,

1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:52.680
 which is really kind of interesting.

1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:54.420
 It's not focused on growth hormone,

1:00:54.420 --> 1:00:56.940
 but the book is called Altered Traits.

1:00:56.940 --> 1:00:58.420
 This is the book.

1:00:58.420 --> 1:01:00.340
 It's an excellent book.

1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:03.140
 Altered Traits by Goleman and Davidson,

1:01:03.140 --> 1:01:05.260
 Science Reveals How Meditation Changes

1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:07.380
 Your Mind, Brain, and Body.

1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:09.100
 Very interesting book.

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:11.540
 For those of you that are interested in meditation,

1:01:11.540 --> 1:01:14.140
 and perhaps those of you who are not,

1:01:14.140 --> 1:01:15.260
 but are considering it,

1:01:16.220 --> 1:01:18.220
 what they talk about in this book is the fact

1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:21.120
 that meditation has two separate lines of effects.

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:23.380
 One of those lines of effects

1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:25.220
 are things that change your state.

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:27.880
 So you're stressed, you sit down, you meditate,

1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:29.860
 and you relax, and you go into a particular state.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:32.620
 The other are the changes that occur over time,

1:01:32.620 --> 1:01:34.620
 and those are changes in trait.

1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:36.660
 So personality can actually change

1:01:36.660 --> 1:01:41.660
 with long bouts of TM meditation or repeated meditation.

1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:44.060
 In any case, the reason we're talking

1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:46.260
 about altered traits today

1:01:46.260 --> 1:01:50.900
 is because certain types of meditation

1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:53.640
 can get people's brains into states

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:56.540
 that very closely mimic slow wave sleep.

1:01:56.540 --> 1:01:58.140
 If you hear snoring in the background,

1:01:58.140 --> 1:02:01.420
 Costello is, it sounds like he's in slow wave sleep,

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:04.260
 these big oscillatory snores

1:02:04.260 --> 1:02:07.920
 that he's in 23.6 hours per day.

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.300
 So what this means is for people that are interested

1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.580
 in increasing growth hormone,

1:02:13.580 --> 1:02:15.580
 a meditation practice that allows you

1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:20.580
 to get into these slow wave delta type frequency activity

1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:24.780
 in the brain may be very beneficial

1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:25.860
 because as I mentioned before,

1:02:25.860 --> 1:02:28.020
 that's what's gating growth hormone release.

1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:29.860
 It's not just a circadian phenomenon.

1:02:29.860 --> 1:02:32.960
 It's actually controlled by these brain waves.

1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:34.920
 I did look up binaural beats.

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:36.940
 I get so many questions about binaural beats,

1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:38.580
 and it's a really attractive idea, right?

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:39.900
 Binaural beats, for those of you who don't know,

1:02:39.900 --> 1:02:41.940
 you listen to one frequency of tone,

1:02:41.940 --> 1:02:43.040
 doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, in one ear,

1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:44.540
 and another frequency of tone in the other ear,

1:02:44.540 --> 1:02:48.220
 doo, doo, doo, doo, and then the brain essentially

1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:50.080
 takes the average of the two,

1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:52.820
 or there's some other wiring in the brainstem

1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:54.020
 that makes it not quite the average,

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:57.560
 but takes the average of the two for sake of discussion,

1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:00.280
 and that frequency is what the brain entrains

1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:01.900
 or maps onto.

1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:03.800
 There are a lot of apps that are claiming

1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:05.800
 that you can get the brain into delta waves

1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:06.860
 using binaural beats.

1:03:06.860 --> 1:03:09.840
 I could not find quality peer review studies

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:11.900
 supporting that, but I know there are a lot of fans

1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:13.220
 out there of binaural beats.

1:03:13.220 --> 1:03:15.500
 If you know of any literature that's independent

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:18.660
 of the company that makes the binaural beat technology,

1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:21.960
 so unbiased research, please send it my way,

1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:26.960
 but in Altered Traits, Goleman and Davidson talk about

1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:30.460
 the fact that people who do 20 minutes of sitting meditation

1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:35.460
 per day can access these slow wave sleep-like brain states.

1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:40.360
 Now I've talked a lot on here about non-sleep deep rest,

1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:42.580
 things like yoga nidra and hypnosis.

1:03:42.580 --> 1:03:44.580
 I'm not aware that those will put people

1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:48.840
 into slow wave sleep per se, or delta waves per se.

1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:50.380
 So we're really talking about 20 minutes

1:03:50.380 --> 1:03:52.260
 of more traditional type meditation.

1:03:52.260 --> 1:03:55.700
 Okay, so we talked about very low doses of melatonin

1:03:55.700 --> 1:03:57.200
 as a way to trigger delta waves

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:59.580
 and more growth hormone release in sleep.

1:03:59.580 --> 1:04:00.820
 There are science to support that.

1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:05.100
 We've now talked about a waking behavior of 20 minutes

1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:08.020
 of sort of what I would call standard meditation

1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:09.980
 of just sitting there concentrating on one's breathing

1:04:09.980 --> 1:04:13.880
 to try and access delta waves, binaural beats,

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.540
 no science yet, who knows,

1:04:15.540 --> 1:04:17.280
 maybe there's science to support it.

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:18.900
 If you're aware of it, let me know.

1:04:18.900 --> 1:04:21.580
 Now let's move to the things that one can do

1:04:21.580 --> 1:04:25.060
 that have been shown to have, let's just be honest,

1:04:25.060 --> 1:04:28.900
 pretty enormous effects on growth hormone release in waking.

1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:31.900
 And these are things that are very actionable.

1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:34.260
 One of the things that can have a dramatic effect

1:04:34.260 --> 1:04:37.100
 on levels of growth hormone release in waking,

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:42.020
 as well as in sleep the following night is exercise.

1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:46.580
 But the key is the type of exercise and the duration.

1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:48.860
 Now there's a logic to this.

1:04:48.860 --> 1:04:51.300
 There are hundreds, if not thousands of studies

1:04:51.300 --> 1:04:54.400
 measuring growth hormone, both during

1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:59.740
 or sometimes after exercise or the following night.

1:04:59.740 --> 1:05:03.180
 And the conclusion that one takes away from all of these

1:05:03.180 --> 1:05:07.780
 is that exercise has to be of particular duration

1:05:07.780 --> 1:05:10.780
 and intensity in order to get growth hormone release.

1:05:10.780 --> 1:05:13.480
 So first I'm just going to tell you what I found to be

1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:15.880
 the maximum amount of growth hormone release

1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:18.900
 as it relates to a particular form of exercise.

1:05:18.900 --> 1:05:22.220
 The particular form of exercise is either weight training

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:25.820
 or it can be endurance training,

1:05:25.820 --> 1:05:28.140
 but the endurance training and the weight training

1:05:28.140 --> 1:05:31.420
 actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes,

1:05:31.420 --> 1:05:32.320
 not much longer.

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:35.900
 Now this is important because it's been shown

1:05:35.900 --> 1:05:40.060
 over and over again that if one exercise is too long

1:05:40.060 --> 1:05:42.000
 with weights or endurance exercise,

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.580
 that cortisol levels go high enough

1:05:44.580 --> 1:05:47.500
 that it starts to inhibit the testosterone

1:05:47.500 --> 1:05:49.660
 and even the estrogen pathways.

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:53.420
 This is why I believe people who over exercise

1:05:53.420 --> 1:05:55.760
 or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles,

1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:57.140
 they stop menstruating.

1:05:57.140 --> 1:05:59.060
 It's why you get suppressions and testosterone

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:01.360
 if people train too long and too hard.

1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:04.500
 The cutoff has always been 60 to 75 minutes

1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:06.340
 of the hard work part.

1:06:06.340 --> 1:06:08.780
 It's going to vary a lot from person to person,

1:06:08.780 --> 1:06:10.740
 but in terms of growth hormone,

1:06:10.740 --> 1:06:12.540
 the conditions that seem to lead

1:06:12.540 --> 1:06:17.540
 to the greatest growth hormone release are one, get warm.

1:06:17.740 --> 1:06:19.380
 This is interesting, we're going to talk about temperature.

1:06:19.380 --> 1:06:22.980
 So a proper warmup seems to accelerate

1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:24.840
 the release of growth hormone

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:27.240
 once the hard work phase starts.

1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:29.980
 So 10 minutes of warmup or so

1:06:29.980 --> 1:06:32.980
 was the number that I extracted from all these studies.

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:35.880
 There's a beautiful review on this by the way.

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:38.940
 Growth hormone response is a varying, excuse me,

1:06:38.940 --> 1:06:43.260
 growth hormone arginine and exercise.

1:06:43.260 --> 1:06:44.920
 We'll talk about arginine in a few minutes.

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:49.920
 That's by Kannalei, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y.

1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:51.900
 It was published in Current Opinion

1:06:51.900 --> 1:06:54.480
 in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Clear.

1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:55.700
 The Current Opinion journals

1:06:55.700 --> 1:06:57.780
 are generally of pretty high quality

1:06:58.780 --> 1:07:00.100
 in terms of the reviews,

1:07:00.100 --> 1:07:01.820
 just because they tend to be pretty recent.

1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:06.140
 And then the references they're in are also quite good.

1:07:06.140 --> 1:07:07.500
 So what does this mean?

1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:09.860
 This means warm up and when you say warm up,

1:07:09.860 --> 1:07:12.560
 it doesn't mean just warm up the limbs and tissues

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:14.100
 that you're going to use so you don't get injured,

1:07:14.100 --> 1:07:15.960
 actually warm the body.

1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:17.540
 So there was actually some discussion

1:07:17.540 --> 1:07:19.360
 about whether or not in cold winter months,

1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:21.860
 people should wear like a stocking cap,

1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:25.200
 bringing the conditions of making the room warm.

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:27.540
 So getting the body warm as a warm up

1:07:27.540 --> 1:07:30.360
 seems to be important because temperature of the body

1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:32.600
 seems to be an important condition

1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:35.580
 or prerequisite for certain patterns of exercise

1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:37.720
 to maximize growth hormone release.

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:39.940
 So this is really interesting to me.

1:07:39.940 --> 1:07:41.920
 I have an obsession with how body temperature,

1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:44.060
 light exercise and food interact.

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:47.620
 We're going right there with the fact that if you get warm,

1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:49.940
 you bring up the body temperature a degree or two

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:53.780
 or maybe three and then start exercise.

1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:57.620
 It does appear that high intensity exercise,

1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:01.160
 but again, as discussed in a previous episode,

1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:05.220
 not exercise that brings muscles to failure,

1:08:05.220 --> 1:08:06.220
 but close to it.

1:08:06.220 --> 1:08:08.080
 So if it's weight-bearing exercise,

1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:11.120
 it would be getting close to that final repetitions

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:12.140
 where you can't complete them,

1:08:12.140 --> 1:08:14.660
 but not pushing through those or even going to failure,

1:08:14.660 --> 1:08:19.420
 but getting close leads to anywhere from 300 to 500%

1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:21.940
 increases in resting growth hormone levels

1:08:21.940 --> 1:08:26.060
 and 300 to 500% increases in growth hormone

1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:28.300
 the following night when you go to sleep,

1:08:28.300 --> 1:08:30.220
 which is incredible.

1:08:30.220 --> 1:08:33.200
 Now I want to dissect this properly, okay?

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:37.060
 So one of the other conditions that seemed to be important

1:08:37.060 --> 1:08:40.460
 again was to have relatively low blood glucose.

1:08:40.460 --> 1:08:43.180
 So it's looking a lot like the conditions you need for sleep

1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:45.960
 in order to get maximum growth hormone release in sleep.

1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:49.100
 So not having blood glucose too high or too low,

1:08:49.940 --> 1:08:51.580
 that's a discussion unto itself.

1:08:51.580 --> 1:08:54.200
 You want to have sufficient energy to do the exercise,

1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:56.420
 but getting warm, not having blood glucose

1:08:56.420 --> 1:08:57.260
 too high or too low,

1:08:57.260 --> 1:08:59.740
 so probably not eating too close to exercise

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:04.260
 or not ingesting a lot of sugars during the exercise.

1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:06.260
 That was supported by the fact that ingestion

1:09:06.260 --> 1:09:09.300
 of a sports drink that contains caloric sugar

1:09:09.300 --> 1:09:12.200
 immediately flat-lined the growth hormone levels.

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.140
 So really interesting relationship

1:09:14.140 --> 1:09:17.040
 between insulin, glucose, and growth hormone.

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.340
 So then doing the training for anywhere from 60 to 75 minutes

1:09:21.340 --> 1:09:23.060
 to maximize growth hormone release.

1:09:23.060 --> 1:09:25.880
 And then the other interesting thing

1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:28.560
 was that even after the exercise,

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:31.480
 taking body temperature back down to normal levels

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:35.100
 relatively quickly seemed to be associated

1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:37.120
 with these big spikes in growth hormone.

1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:39.040
 Otherwise, what would happen is you get these big spikes

1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:41.960
 in growth hormone, but if the exercise went too long

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:44.760
 or if body temperature remained too high for too long,

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:47.500
 then you didn't get the second increase in growth hormone

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:48.900
 the following night, okay?

1:09:48.900 --> 1:09:50.700
 So I hope I made that abundantly clear.

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:53.100
 Warm up well, get body temperature up,

1:09:53.100 --> 1:09:55.560
 exercise 60 to 75 minutes.

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:57.060
 Don't go to absolute failure

1:09:57.060 --> 1:10:00.820
 if your interest is in growth hormone release

1:10:00.820 --> 1:10:04.180
 both during the exercise and later that night.

1:10:04.180 --> 1:10:07.260
 And if you can bring body temperature back down

1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:08.780
 to normal levels by cooling off,

1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:11.040
 maybe cool shower or maybe ice pack or something,

1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:13.960
 or maybe just turning off the heat in the room

1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:15.820
 or going outside, whatever it is,

1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:17.380
 then you increase the probability

1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:19.680
 that you're going to increase growth hormone

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.540
 the following night as well.

1:10:21.540 --> 1:10:24.140
 And again, these are big increases, 300 to 500%.

1:10:24.140 --> 1:10:27.180
 And it's almost like you're getting a second sleep during

1:10:27.180 --> 1:10:28.940
 the day, but if the exercise is too hard,

1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:31.580
 if body temperature stays too high for too long,

1:10:31.580 --> 1:10:33.140
 you disrupt the whole process

1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:35.820
 and you don't get the effect of increased growth hormone.

1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:37.380
 Growth hormone is really powerful,

1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:39.060
 but it doesn't work alone.

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:42.100
 In fact, a lot of the effects of growth hormone are mediated

1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:43.660
 by its effects on the liver.

1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:45.560
 So growth hormone is released, goes to the liver,

1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.940
 and then the liver releases something called IGF-1,

1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:50.380
 insulin growth factor one.

1:10:50.380 --> 1:10:53.400
 Insulin growth factor one was popular

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:55.660
 in the neuroscience community as an area of focus

1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:59.020
 because of its ability to trigger improvements in memory

1:10:59.020 --> 1:11:01.380
 and learning after exercise.

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:03.620
 And indeed, exercise triggers both the release

1:11:03.620 --> 1:11:05.900
 of growth hormone and IGF-1.

1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:08.660
 IGF-1 seems responsible for a lot of the effects

1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:10.560
 of improved memory.

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:14.100
 Some people report that that is due to increased number

1:11:14.100 --> 1:11:16.540
 of neurons or neurogenesis, birth of new neurons.

1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:18.180
 It's pretty clear that in humans,

1:11:18.180 --> 1:11:19.820
 that's not what's happening.

1:11:19.820 --> 1:11:21.220
 Yes, in animals, not in humans.

1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:23.440
 IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:25.240
 on memory and cognition.

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:27.340
 And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release

1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:30.460
 and growth hormone release is through exercise.

1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:32.460
 Now, the interesting thing,

1:11:32.460 --> 1:11:35.020
 and the reason I'm bringing up IGF-1 here,

1:11:35.020 --> 1:11:37.460
 is that certain patterns of exercise,

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:39.340
 actually duration of exercise,

1:11:39.340 --> 1:11:42.440
 have different effects on IGF-1 and growth hormone,

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.140
 depending on whether or not the exercise is done

1:11:46.140 --> 1:11:47.560
 by men or women.

1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:50.500
 There's what we call a sex dependent effect.

1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:53.800
 And the sex dependent effect is as follows.

1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:55.960
 In this particular study and several others,

1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:58.440
 what they did is they had people exercise,

1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:01.720
 they measured growth hormone and IGF-1 levels

1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:05.660
 from the blood before, during, and after exercise.

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:08.340
 And they could see when the greatest increases occurred.

1:12:08.340 --> 1:12:11.700
 This was standard sorts of resistance exercise.

1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:16.700
 So some squats, there was a sprint-like activity.

1:12:16.700 --> 1:12:21.700
 It doesn't really matter what the specific exercises were.

1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:22.880
 None of them were to failure.

1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:26.580
 These were in kind of the 10 repetition or less range,

1:12:26.580 --> 1:12:28.800
 six sets, so kind of standard weight training stuff

1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:31.600
 that anyone might do.

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:34.460
 But what was interesting is that women were able

1:12:34.460 --> 1:12:37.040
 to access the biggest peak in growth hormone

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:40.920
 and IGF-1 early in the exercise, so in the first 30 minutes.

1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:45.160
 So what this means is even if you just have 30 minutes,

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:48.860
 at least for women, there's going to be a big increase

1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:51.000
 in growth hormone and IGF-1 in the first 30 minutes.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.920
 For men, the biggest increase occurred later

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:58.920
 in the exercise, which was 60 minutes or so total.

1:12:59.540 --> 1:13:02.580
 And so the sex dependent effects are interesting.

1:13:02.580 --> 1:13:04.500
 They point to the fact that things like cortisol,

1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:06.580
 testosterone, and estrogen, which of course vary

1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:08.620
 in different levels in men and women,

1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:12.700
 are going to impact the release of things like IGF-1

1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:13.540
 and growth hormone.

1:13:13.540 --> 1:13:16.260
 And yes, they did control for all sorts of things

1:13:16.260 --> 1:13:18.900
 like diet, and they controlled for weight

1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:19.980
 and prior experience.

1:13:19.980 --> 1:13:21.760
 It's actually a quite nice study.

1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:25.340
 If you'd like to check it out, it's by Pierce et al.

1:13:25.340 --> 1:13:28.500
 Growth Hormone and Insulin Glow Factor-1 Molecular Weight.

1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:32.180
 Isoform response to resistance exercise are sex dependent

1:13:32.180 --> 1:13:34.060
 in frontiers and endocrinology.

1:13:34.060 --> 1:13:37.100
 Fine Journal in 2020, so it's quite recent.

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:38.420
 So what does this mean?

1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:41.180
 This means if you're exercising

1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:43.800
 and you want growth hormone release, warm up,

1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:46.100
 do the type of exercise we've been discussing.

1:13:47.380 --> 1:13:48.980
 Women in the first 30 minutes

1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:50.660
 is when you're going to get the maximum benefit

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:52.580
 in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.

1:13:52.580 --> 1:13:55.860
 Men, you have to keep going for the entire 60 minutes,

1:13:55.860 --> 1:13:58.220
 so don't tap out early if you're interested

1:13:58.220 --> 1:14:00.860
 in getting the growth hormone and IGF-1 release.

1:14:00.860 --> 1:14:04.120
 And the same conditions apply about then cooling down

1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:06.220
 and not making the exercise last so long

1:14:06.220 --> 1:14:08.180
 that you don't get the increase in growth hormone

1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:09.820
 the following night.

1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:13.280
 My experience thus far in doing this podcast

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:16.120
 is that people fall into one of two categories.

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:18.900
 There are the, just tell me what to take people,

1:14:18.900 --> 1:14:21.980
 the people that are really eager to try supplements

1:14:21.980 --> 1:14:24.180
 and maybe even prescription compounds.

1:14:24.180 --> 1:14:25.020
 And then there are people

1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:28.460
 who are a little bit more shy about supplementation.

1:14:28.460 --> 1:14:30.640
 They are more focused on what they can do with diet

1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:32.900
 and behaviors and things of that sort.

1:14:32.900 --> 1:14:34.100
 I don't have a bias either way.

1:14:34.100 --> 1:14:36.540
 I try and offer tools that are supported

1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:38.240
 by the scientific literature.

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:41.320
 And I always point to safety margins.

1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:44.380
 There are supplements that can increase growth hormone

1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:46.320
 to a considerable degree.

1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:49.080
 And no, these aren't growth hormone itself,

1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:51.080
 although that of course will increase growth hormone

1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:52.060
 to a considerable degree.

1:14:52.060 --> 1:14:54.160
 We will talk about prescription drugs at the end,

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:55.440
 not just growth hormone,

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:58.440
 but some other things that are quite prominently

1:14:58.440 --> 1:14:59.520
 in use right now,

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:02.760
 in particular in the entertainment industry.

1:15:03.740 --> 1:15:06.260
 It's pretty interesting compounds.

1:15:06.260 --> 1:15:07.920
 But first let's talk about supplements.

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.500
 So this has been known about for some time,

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:14.280
 but arginine, the amino acid arginine,

1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:17.020
 as well as the amino acid ornithine

1:15:17.020 --> 1:15:20.540
 can increase growth hormone levels substantially.

1:15:20.540 --> 1:15:24.620
 Now, arginine has a number of effects.

1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:27.180
 You can get it from food, you can get it from supplements.

1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:30.780
 Some people take it in pill form or capsule form.

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:34.900
 Some people will actually take it by IV, intravenously.

1:15:34.900 --> 1:15:39.620
 The levels and the amounts of arginine required

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:42.580
 to get big growth hormone release increases

1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:43.700
 is pretty substantial.

1:15:43.700 --> 1:15:46.860
 So some people will take arginine before bedtime.

1:15:46.860 --> 1:15:49.740
 Some people will take it before exercise.

1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:53.380
 The prerequisite again is low blood glucose.

1:15:53.380 --> 1:15:56.820
 Blood glucose is high, it's going to quash the effect.

1:15:56.820 --> 1:15:59.720
 The amounts of arginine that people take

1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:04.260
 are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams

1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:05.660
 or sometimes even more.

1:16:05.660 --> 1:16:09.580
 Although this is definitely a case of more is not better.

1:16:09.580 --> 1:16:12.820
 There is a threshold at which growth hormone release

1:16:12.820 --> 1:16:16.380
 is actually blunted by taking more than nine grams

1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:17.840
 of arginine.

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:20.700
 Now, nine grams of arginine orally is a lot of pills.

1:16:20.700 --> 1:16:23.020
 It's at minimum nine pills.

1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:26.640
 And it can cause some GI disturbance, right?

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:27.780
 People can feel nauseous.

1:16:27.780 --> 1:16:29.060
 Some people will throw it up.

1:16:29.060 --> 1:16:34.240
 Some people will get some constipation or diarrhea, et cetera,

1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:35.540
 or just stomach aches.

1:16:35.540 --> 1:16:37.740
 I'm certainly not suggesting people do this,

1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:39.460
 that they take arginine,

1:16:39.460 --> 1:16:42.700
 but that's the reason why most of the studies

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:46.140
 that looked at the role of arginine on growth hormone levels

1:16:46.140 --> 1:16:50.200
 did it by IV, intravenous infusion.

1:16:50.200 --> 1:16:52.600
 So what's interesting, however,

1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:56.980
 is that whether or not it's by mouth or by vein,

1:16:56.980 --> 1:17:00.180
 taking arginine can dramatically increase

1:17:00.180 --> 1:17:01.600
 growth hormone release.

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:05.380
 And the levels or the amount of increase

1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:09.640
 raised was anywhere from 100 on the low end,

1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:13.300
 but anywhere from basically from 400 to 600%

1:17:13.300 --> 1:17:14.140
 above baseline.

1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:17.740
 So these are huge increases in growth hormone.

1:17:17.740 --> 1:17:19.340
 Now, I've never tried arginine.

1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:22.860
 Arginine is out there for a number of different purposes.

1:17:22.860 --> 1:17:24.940
 One of them is to increase growth hormone.

1:17:24.940 --> 1:17:27.780
 Some of the supplements out there to increase growth hormone

1:17:27.780 --> 1:17:30.300
 include arginine and ornithine.

1:17:30.300 --> 1:17:35.200
 Arginine does have the effect of dilating arterioles

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:39.180
 and it basically increases blood supply.

1:17:39.180 --> 1:17:42.140
 The arginine pathway is involved in vasodilation.

1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:44.580
 It's actually the pathway that's downstream

1:17:44.580 --> 1:17:47.700
 of a lot of drugs that are used to treat things

1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:49.020
 like erectile dysfunction.

1:17:49.020 --> 1:17:51.860
 And anytime people have problems

1:17:51.860 --> 1:17:55.020
 with peripheral blood flow of any kind,

1:17:55.020 --> 1:18:00.020
 they focus on compounds that will either disrupt the enzymes

1:18:01.060 --> 1:18:03.980
 or will adjust the levels of amino acids

1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:05.340
 to get more vasodilation.

1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:07.500
 So taking arginine for the purpose

1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:10.300
 of increasing growth hormone will also have the effect

1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:11.980
 of dilating blood vessels.

1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:14.380
 And for people with blood, excuse me, with heart conditions,

1:18:14.380 --> 1:18:17.220
 that actually can be a serious issue.

1:18:17.220 --> 1:18:19.300
 Now, here is something really important

1:18:19.300 --> 1:18:20.780
 and interesting to note,

1:18:20.780 --> 1:18:24.900
 which is that increasing arginine levels

1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:28.420
 with the specific goal of increasing growth hormone release

1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:33.420
 can actually short circuit the effects of exercise

1:18:33.420 --> 1:18:34.340
 on growth hormone.

1:18:34.340 --> 1:18:37.660
 Several studies I looked at looked at the interaction

1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:42.100
 of taking arginine and the exercise

1:18:42.100 --> 1:18:44.780
 or just the arginine or just the exercise alone.

1:18:44.780 --> 1:18:47.060
 And so you don't, unfortunately,

1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:48.660
 if growth hormone increases your goal,

1:18:48.660 --> 1:18:52.160
 you don't unfortunately get to increase growth hormone 800%

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:53.840
 by taking arginine and exercising.

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:57.580
 It always seems to be clamped at about 300 to 500% increases,

1:18:57.580 --> 1:18:59.180
 still large increases.

1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:00.900
 So I make that point for several reasons.

1:19:00.900 --> 1:19:04.620
 First of all, be aware that arginine has these other effects

1:19:04.620 --> 1:19:06.940
 on vasodilation, take those seriously

1:19:06.940 --> 1:19:08.180
 if you have a heart condition

1:19:08.180 --> 1:19:10.620
 or take them seriously in any case.

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:13.500
 Second of all, you can supplement with arginine,

1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:17.120
 not exercise and get these big increases in growth hormone

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:19.140
 by taking them before sleep.

1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:23.300
 But if you're taking the arginine before exercise,

1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:25.340
 you are going to short circuit

1:19:25.340 --> 1:19:29.020
 or clamp the effects of exercise on growth hormone, okay?

1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:31.720
 So it's something that one could use,

1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:35.420
 but it doesn't have a synergistic effect with exercise.

1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:39.180
 The two more or less cancel each other out, not to zero,

1:19:39.180 --> 1:19:41.100
 but you end up with the same effect you would

1:19:41.100 --> 1:19:42.840
 had you done one or the other.

1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:44.280
 So hopefully that's clear.

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:46.260
 The other thing is if one's goal

1:19:46.260 --> 1:19:48.580
 is really to increase arginine in the blood

1:19:48.580 --> 1:19:49.460
 for whatever reason,

1:19:49.460 --> 1:19:53.140
 arginine may not actually be the best way to do that

1:19:53.140 --> 1:19:56.180
 because of the way it's metabolized in the gut.

1:19:56.180 --> 1:20:00.080
 It doesn't have access or get access to the tissues

1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:01.620
 that you're most interested in

1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:03.220
 in terms of increasing growth hormone

1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:04.860
 or vasodilation for that matter.

1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:08.220
 And in that case, there's something else called L-citrulline

1:20:08.220 --> 1:20:11.860
 which has powerful effects on vasodilation,

1:20:11.860 --> 1:20:16.860
 powerful effects on potentially on growth hormone levels

1:20:17.580 --> 1:20:19.180
 via the arginine pathway.

1:20:19.180 --> 1:20:23.540
 But basically L-citrulline acts as sort of a donor

1:20:23.540 --> 1:20:25.880
 or let's say it's kind of a biological prerequisite

1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:29.780
 for arginine and can lead to even bigger arginine increases

1:20:29.780 --> 1:20:32.180
 than you would get if you took arginine itself.

1:20:32.180 --> 1:20:34.660
 And so L-citrulline is out there.

1:20:34.660 --> 1:20:37.680
 Keep in mind that anything that dilates the blood vessels

1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:39.100
 will lower blood pressure.

1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:42.020
 So L-citrulline, yes, will lead to increased blood flow

1:20:42.020 --> 1:20:44.620
 for whatever purpose you want to use it for,

1:20:44.620 --> 1:20:47.180
 whether or not that's pumps in the gym or whatever.

1:20:48.180 --> 1:20:50.440
 It also can lead to big increases

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:52.080
 in arginine and growth hormone,

1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:54.220
 but it will lower blood pressure.

1:20:54.220 --> 1:20:56.140
 So be aware of that

1:20:56.140 --> 1:20:58.700
 and understand that the biology isn't so straightforward.

1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:00.400
 L-citrulline may actually be the better way

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:03.900
 to get arginine increases than arginine itself.

1:21:03.900 --> 1:21:07.780
 And ornithine can also increase growth hormone,

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:10.140
 although that's also through an indirect pathway.

1:21:10.140 --> 1:21:13.460
 And nowadays there isn't a lot of focus on ornithine

1:21:13.460 --> 1:21:15.420
 as a way to increase growth hormone.

1:21:15.420 --> 1:21:17.700
 That was kind of all the rage in the 90s,

1:21:17.700 --> 1:21:18.740
 not so much anymore.

1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:20.560
 Nowadays, the people who are really in the know

1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:23.380
 for this stuff tend to focus on L-citrulline.

1:21:23.380 --> 1:21:26.540
 And if you're interested in L-citrulline or arginine,

1:21:26.540 --> 1:21:30.340
 I highly recommend you go to our old friend,

1:21:30.340 --> 1:21:32.540
 good friends examine.com,

1:21:32.540 --> 1:21:35.900
 because there you can put it into the list.

1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:39.420
 You can just put search and it's totally free.

1:21:39.420 --> 1:21:41.380
 And it will tell you that blood pressure

1:21:41.380 --> 1:21:42.460
 will be slightly decreased.

1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:44.460
 Power output in the gym will increase.

1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:46.360
 There's very strong effects on blood glucose.

1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:48.800
 Fatigue is reduced notably.

1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:51.200
 Big increases in nitric oxide.

1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:54.020
 That's also related to the increase in vasodilation.

1:21:54.020 --> 1:21:58.180
 Plasma, arginine, very high, excuse me,

1:21:58.180 --> 1:22:01.980
 notable effects, very high support for studies

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:03.860
 which allow people more training volume,

1:22:03.860 --> 1:22:06.420
 aerobic exercise, arterial stiffness is brought down.

1:22:06.420 --> 1:22:07.860
 There's a huge list of things.

1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:09.660
 Increase in growth hormone.

1:22:09.660 --> 1:22:13.500
 So two studies showing this was done double-blind.

1:22:13.500 --> 1:22:14.980
 Great, you always want to see double-blind,

1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:16.080
 placebo-controlled.

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:18.940
 This was only done in males, not in females.

1:22:18.940 --> 1:22:21.740
 Unfortunately, just have data from males.

1:22:21.740 --> 1:22:23.780
 But increases in growth hormone,

1:22:23.780 --> 1:22:27.380
 it's a small but a real significant effect.

1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:29.300
 And again, from quality studies.

1:22:29.300 --> 1:22:31.340
 So there's a huge number of effects there.

1:22:31.340 --> 1:22:34.660
 And some of the other kind of more interesting ones

1:22:34.660 --> 1:22:38.980
 about L-citrulline that you might not have thought about

1:22:38.980 --> 1:22:42.060
 are things like muscle oxygenation,

1:22:44.100 --> 1:22:47.260
 as we scroll down, decreases in C-reactive protein.

1:22:47.260 --> 1:22:50.260
 So a lot of the same things that you might expect,

1:22:50.260 --> 1:22:53.020
 excuse me, from the same sorts of compounds we saw before.

1:22:53.020 --> 1:22:56.140
 The takeaway here is if you want to increase growth hormone,

1:22:56.140 --> 1:22:57.780
 think about the arginine pathway,

1:22:57.780 --> 1:23:01.060
 but arginine itself might not be the best direct route

1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:01.900
 to get there.

1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:03.860
 L-citrulline might be a better option,

1:23:03.860 --> 1:23:07.100
 but please do consider and take very seriously

1:23:07.100 --> 1:23:08.600
 the effects on blood pressure.

1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:11.860
 So we've been talking about big effects

1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:15.380
 from supplementation or exercise on growth hormone,

1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:17.700
 this extremely powerful hormone.

1:23:17.700 --> 1:23:20.340
 And one thing to note is that

1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:24.200
 the profile of growth hormone as we age changes.

1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:25.500
 I mentioned that earlier,

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:28.540
 but it's important to understand how it changes.

1:23:28.540 --> 1:23:30.200
 One thing that's particularly interesting to me

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:31.980
 as somebody who's in his 40s

1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:36.620
 is that it's actually between ages 30 and 40,

1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:39.100
 that the amount of growth hormone that you release

1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:42.940
 each night is reduced by two to threefold.

1:23:42.940 --> 1:23:44.660
 That's really incredible.

1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.740
 We hear so much about testosterone levels going down

1:23:47.740 --> 1:23:49.980
 as we age or estrogen levels going down.

1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:53.360
 But if you recall from the testosterone and estrogen episode

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:55.980
 talked about the fact that if you really look at the data,

1:23:55.980 --> 1:23:58.100
 just for instance, on testosterone,

1:23:58.100 --> 1:24:00.580
 there are men in their 90s,

1:24:00.580 --> 1:24:02.860
 and they are not rare, it turns out,

1:24:02.860 --> 1:24:06.220
 that are making as much testosterone and DHT,

1:24:06.220 --> 1:24:09.780
 dihydrotestosterone, as they were in their 20s, okay?

1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:11.900
 So we hear so much nowadays about how

1:24:11.900 --> 1:24:13.360
 testosterone levels are dropping,

1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:15.520
 sperm levels are dropping, et cetera.

1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:17.420
 And I don't dispute that.

1:24:17.420 --> 1:24:19.540
 I talked about that in that episode.

1:24:19.540 --> 1:24:21.260
 But it's clear that testosterone levels

1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:23.980
 vary tremendously from person to person.

1:24:23.980 --> 1:24:26.500
 And just getting older does not necessarily mean

1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:28.740
 that testosterone levels are dropping.

1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:31.380
 Growth hormone levels, it seems,

1:24:31.380 --> 1:24:33.900
 are dropping when people are in their 30s and 40s,

1:24:33.900 --> 1:24:35.340
 and they're dropping substantially.

1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:37.580
 And that seems to be the case across the board.

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:38.940
 You're just not going to find people

1:24:38.940 --> 1:24:40.460
 in their 40s, 50s, and 60s

1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:42.540
 that are making as much growth hormone

1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:44.780
 as they were in their teens and 20s.

1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:48.300
 And as somebody who, I feel really good,

1:24:48.300 --> 1:24:50.660
 but as somebody who definitely noticed

1:24:50.660 --> 1:24:51.940
 that as I got into my 40s,

1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:54.160
 that even if I slept the same amount,

1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:56.940
 I wasn't feeling quite as,

1:24:56.940 --> 1:25:01.940
 I would say, able to recover from exercise or wound healing,

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:03.500
 even with the same amount of sleep.

1:25:03.500 --> 1:25:05.880
 And I was trying to optimize a great number of things.

1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:07.620
 This business of growth hormone

1:25:07.620 --> 1:25:09.380
 became of particular interest to me.

1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:11.780
 And since the ways to manipulate growth hormone

1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:14.060
 in men and in women are so straightforward,

1:25:14.060 --> 1:25:15.940
 and since everybody goes through this

1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:18.500
 age-related decline very dramatically,

1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:19.980
 it seems to me that the things

1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:21.460
 that we're supposed to be doing anyway,

1:25:21.460 --> 1:25:24.620
 like exercising, like trying not to eat too close to bedtime,

1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:25.700
 trying to optimize sleep,

1:25:25.700 --> 1:25:27.100
 all of these are wonderful tools

1:25:27.100 --> 1:25:31.540
 that we should be pursuing and perhaps using,

1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:34.220
 and they can actually offset

1:25:34.220 --> 1:25:36.340
 the two to three-fold decrease, right?

1:25:36.340 --> 1:25:38.100
 If we're talking about a two to three-fold decrease

1:25:38.100 --> 1:25:40.220
 for people that are in their 30s and 40s,

1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:43.260
 and then we're talking about increases from exercise

1:25:43.260 --> 1:25:45.160
 or from maybe from supplementation,

1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:48.980
 but certainly from exercise of 300 to 500%,

1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:50.960
 well, then all of a sudden we're in a position

1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:53.180
 to actually offset the age-related decline

1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:55.780
 and growth hormone completely just through behaviors.

1:25:55.780 --> 1:25:59.140
 And I think that's quite interesting and quite powerful.

1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:00.380
 Now I'd like to discuss a way

1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:02.160
 that anyone can increase their levels

1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:04.140
 of growth hormone dramatically.

1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:06.520
 And when I say dramatically, I mean dramatically.

1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:08.380
 I'll get to the numbers in a couple of minutes,

1:26:08.380 --> 1:26:12.420
 but we have to remember how growth hormone

1:26:12.420 --> 1:26:14.460
 is released in the first place.

1:26:14.460 --> 1:26:18.020
 Remember, it all starts in the brain, in the hypothalamus.

1:26:18.020 --> 1:26:19.460
 The hypothalamus is a brain area

1:26:19.460 --> 1:26:22.340
 that controls things like sexual behavior,

1:26:22.340 --> 1:26:25.580
 temperature regulation, circadian behavior,

1:26:25.580 --> 1:26:26.800
 meaning when you want to be awake

1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:30.460
 and when you want to be asleep, aggression, all of that.

1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:32.140
 There are other brain areas involved too,

1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:35.180
 but it has a rich collection of different neurons

1:26:35.180 --> 1:26:38.860
 involved in all these very basic functions.

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:42.580
 Now, as we talked about, the releasing hormones,

1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:44.920
 the growth hormone releasing hormone

1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:47.300
 comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.

1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:49.740
 Those then communicate with the pituitary

1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:52.940
 and the pituitary releases growth hormone.

1:26:52.940 --> 1:26:54.180
 And then the growth hormone acts

1:26:54.180 --> 1:26:55.300
 on all these different tissues,

1:26:55.300 --> 1:26:58.400
 muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.

1:26:59.700 --> 1:27:01.220
 Makes them use energy.

1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:02.260
 That's why you lose body fat

1:27:02.260 --> 1:27:03.860
 when growth hormone levels are high.

1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:07.460
 It makes you grow muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera.

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.640
 Now, one of the things that has a profound effect

1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:17.260
 on growth hormone levels, growth hormone release

1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:18.780
 is temperature.

1:27:18.780 --> 1:27:21.020
 Now, the data on this are very strong

1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:23.220
 and the data come from both animal studies

1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:25.100
 and human studies.

1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:27.040
 So there are a number of studies that have explored

1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:31.580
 how making animals cold or hot can increase growth hormone.

1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:35.220
 And if you're guessing which direction this is going to go,

1:27:35.220 --> 1:27:38.140
 you can probably imagine that making animals

1:27:38.140 --> 1:27:41.100
 or people warmer is the way to go

1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:43.220
 if you want to increase growth hormone.

1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:45.940
 Now, anytime you're going to increase temperature

1:27:45.940 --> 1:27:49.660
 of yourself or anyone else or an animal, it is risky.

1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:51.180
 I want to be really clear about this.

1:27:51.180 --> 1:27:54.140
 Not everyone should engage in the behaviors

1:27:54.140 --> 1:27:56.060
 I'm about to describe.

1:27:56.060 --> 1:27:59.100
 But, and I should just say the reason it's risky

1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:01.020
 is it doesn't take much of a temperature increase

1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:03.780
 in the brain to cook the brain, to cook neurons.

1:28:03.780 --> 1:28:06.620
 And after that point, neurons can't come back

1:28:06.620 --> 1:28:09.540
 and people can die from hyperthermia.

1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:11.420
 We have a much greater range in terms of cold.

1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:12.980
 You can also die of hypothermia.

1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:14.940
 You can freeze to death.

1:28:14.940 --> 1:28:18.180
 But you have a much greater range of getting cold

1:28:18.180 --> 1:28:20.400
 than you do warming up the brain.

1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:24.780
 However, there are really strong data pointing to the fact

1:28:24.780 --> 1:28:29.780
 that sauna, aka deliberate hyperthermia,

1:28:30.540 --> 1:28:32.380
 not too high, however,

1:28:32.380 --> 1:28:35.340
 that sauna can increase the release of growth hormone

1:28:35.340 --> 1:28:37.020
 and other hormones.

1:28:37.020 --> 1:28:39.060
 And what's so dramatic about this literature

1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:42.660
 is the size of the effects that are reported.

1:28:42.660 --> 1:28:45.140
 So first of all, let's talk about

1:28:45.140 --> 1:28:46.380
 these temperature increases.

1:28:46.380 --> 1:28:49.460
 And yes, I will refer to things that people can do

1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:52.340
 even if you don't own a sauna.

1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:54.780
 Because I realize not everybody has a sauna

1:28:54.780 --> 1:28:57.020
 in their backyard or has access to a sauna.

1:28:57.020 --> 1:29:01.500
 So first of all, recall our study about exercise

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:04.940
 where warming up a few degrees before the exercise

1:29:04.940 --> 1:29:08.580
 led to bigger and quicker increases in growth hormone

1:29:08.580 --> 1:29:11.100
 during the exercise bout itself.

1:29:11.100 --> 1:29:12.660
 So that already pointed in the direction

1:29:12.660 --> 1:29:14.460
 that temperature was important.

1:29:14.460 --> 1:29:17.700
 Now, the degrees, no pun intended,

1:29:17.700 --> 1:29:21.620
 that we're talking about increasing body temperature

1:29:21.620 --> 1:29:25.140
 is by entering saunas that are somewhere

1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:28.140
 between 176 degrees Fahrenheit,

1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:30.220
 so that's 80 degrees Celsius,

1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:36.540
 and all the way up to like 210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:39.480
 I personally know people that go even higher than that,

1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:41.420
 but they've trained themselves to deal with

1:29:41.420 --> 1:29:42.260
 with very high heat.

1:29:42.260 --> 1:29:43.740
 So again, high heat is dangerous.

1:29:43.740 --> 1:29:45.600
 You must clear this with your doctor.

1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:47.460
 Now, what happens in high heat?

1:29:47.460 --> 1:29:48.740
 Couple of things happen in high heat.

1:29:48.740 --> 1:29:51.940
 First of all, you start getting bigger stroke volume

1:29:51.940 --> 1:29:53.500
 of the heart, kind of like an exercise.

1:29:53.500 --> 1:29:55.700
 Once you get well-trained in endurance activity,

1:29:55.700 --> 1:29:57.180
 your stroke volume, the amount of blood

1:29:57.180 --> 1:29:59.640
 that your heart can pump each time gets larger.

1:30:00.700 --> 1:30:02.860
 You dilate the blood vessels, right?

1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:04.000
 There are a lot of things that happen also.

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.660
 You're sweating, your body's trying to unload heat.

1:30:06.660 --> 1:30:11.420
 So dilation of blood vessels, arginine increases in heat.

1:30:11.420 --> 1:30:14.620
 We're starting to see and hear a common theme,

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:17.160
 but it appears that getting into,

1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:19.900
 I'm not saying getting the body up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,

1:30:19.900 --> 1:30:21.140
 I want to be very clear,

1:30:21.140 --> 1:30:22.460
 not talking about getting the body

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:25.460
 up to 100 degrees Celsius, that would be terrible.

1:30:25.460 --> 1:30:26.420
 You would die.

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:30.160
 But entering environments where it's very hot

1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:31.380
 for short periods of time,

1:30:31.380 --> 1:30:34.180
 anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,

1:30:34.180 --> 1:30:38.980
 where the temperature is 80 degrees Celsius

1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:40.340
 to 100 degrees Celsius,

1:30:40.340 --> 1:30:43.240
 or 175 degrees Fahrenheit, more or less,

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:46.600
 to about 210 degrees Fahrenheit, more or less,

1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:51.600
 has been shown to increase growth hormone release 16 fold.

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:55.780
 That's right, 16 fold, that's 1,600%.

1:30:55.780 --> 1:30:58.020
 Now, there are also effects on other hormones,

1:30:58.020 --> 1:31:00.500
 prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.

1:31:00.500 --> 1:31:03.980
 So the pattern that was described in this study,

1:31:03.980 --> 1:31:05.780
 and there've been many studies now,

1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:11.840
 endocrine effects of rupita sauna were done in 17 humans.

1:31:14.260 --> 1:31:16.500
 This was from doing this repeatedly.

1:31:16.500 --> 1:31:17.860
 So it wasn't the first time they did this.

1:31:17.860 --> 1:31:19.900
 They actually had to do this three days in a row.

1:31:19.900 --> 1:31:23.380
 And the pattern was to get into the sauna for 20 minutes,

1:31:23.380 --> 1:31:25.420
 followed by a 30 minute cooling period.

1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:26.860
 Remember, you don't want to spend long periods

1:31:26.860 --> 1:31:27.740
 of time at high heat.

1:31:27.740 --> 1:31:30.800
 You can cook your brain and other tissues.

1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:33.320
 Be very careful as you approach this if you decide to.

1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:36.540
 But 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,

1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:38.140
 followed by 30 minutes of cooling,

1:31:38.140 --> 1:31:40.620
 followed by 20 minutes sauna, again,

1:31:40.620 --> 1:31:42.680
 led to a five-fold increase in growth hormone.

1:31:42.680 --> 1:31:47.180
 And then by doing that day after day after day,

1:31:47.180 --> 1:31:50.140
 on the third day, you would see these huge increases

1:31:50.140 --> 1:31:52.640
 of like 16 fold, up to 16 fold.

1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:54.440
 And there are now many studies like this.

1:31:54.440 --> 1:31:57.460
 This was described a few years ago.

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:02.540
 But since then, there have been a number of other studies

1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:04.020
 that have pointed in the direction

1:32:04.020 --> 1:32:08.700
 of deliberate hyperthermia, but not too hot,

1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:11.900
 that you kill yourself in order to increase growth hormone.

1:32:11.900 --> 1:32:13.740
 And I know I keep highlighting the dangers there,

1:32:13.740 --> 1:32:16.660
 but again, anytime you're going to mess with heat,

1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:18.980
 you have to be cautious, you have to be careful.

1:32:18.980 --> 1:32:21.920
 So standard sauna can be useful.

1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:23.500
 If you don't have access to a sauna,

1:32:23.500 --> 1:32:25.280
 one way that people do this,

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:27.620
 we have to look to our friends, the wrestlers, right?

1:32:27.620 --> 1:32:31.240
 They wear plastics, which are basically body suits

1:32:31.240 --> 1:32:33.700
 that are fairly inexpensive that you can buy

1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:38.700
 on any online purchase platform, I should say.

1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:41.380
 Some people in the old days

1:32:41.380 --> 1:32:46.380
 before they had these plastics things so readily available,

1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:49.420
 I actually knew people that wrap themselves in garbage bags

1:32:49.420 --> 1:32:50.660
 and then throw on sweats and a hoodie

1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:52.140
 and then go out for a jog.

1:32:52.140 --> 1:32:53.500
 Again, you have to be really careful,

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:56.680
 especially on a hot day, overheating can equate to death,

1:32:56.680 --> 1:32:58.940
 but that's another way to heat up.

1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:00.620
 You don't actually need a sauna.

1:33:00.620 --> 1:33:02.700
 I've known people who will do this in hotel rooms

1:33:02.700 --> 1:33:03.960
 while they're traveling.

1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:06.620
 They'll turn on the heat, make a hot bath.

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:08.420
 They won't actually get in the bath,

1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:10.300
 but they'll fill the room with steam and heat

1:33:10.300 --> 1:33:14.000
 and they'll put on a hoodie and some sweat pants

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:15.900
 and they'll sit there with wool socks on

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:17.580
 and they'll get warm for 20 minutes.

1:33:17.580 --> 1:33:20.780
 Then they'll take a cool shower and then they'll do it again.

1:33:20.780 --> 1:33:22.700
 I guess when the hotel's paying the water bill,

1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:24.080
 you don't worry about it too much.

1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:25.520
 Some people of course own saunas.

1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:26.360
 There are a lot of ways to do that.

1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:27.740
 I have friends who were in the military

1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:30.660
 who made saunas out of cars while they were overseas,

1:33:30.660 --> 1:33:31.700
 all sorts of things.

1:33:31.700 --> 1:33:32.900
 You do have to be careful.

1:33:32.900 --> 1:33:34.200
 I know I've said it many, many times.

1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:35.740
 I just don't want anyone to hurt themselves,

1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:38.060
 but these increases in growth hormone are tremendous

1:33:38.060 --> 1:33:40.260
 and what they probably stem from

1:33:40.260 --> 1:33:43.900
 are increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus

1:33:43.900 --> 1:33:46.820
 that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary.

1:33:46.820 --> 1:33:49.900
 And that's probably because the growth hormone

1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:52.700
 releasing hormone neurons in the hypothalamus

1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:56.100
 sit very closely and may even be intermixed

1:33:56.100 --> 1:33:58.280
 with some of the neurons in the hypothalamus

1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:00.780
 that regulate heat and body temperature.

1:34:00.780 --> 1:34:03.480
 Remember metabolism is in part a heat.

1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:06.120
 It's like a furnace of how much energy you're consuming

1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:11.060
 and using for building or for energy usage purposes.

1:34:11.060 --> 1:34:13.620
 So sauna can be very, very interesting.

1:34:13.620 --> 1:34:16.100
 And again, it's 20 minutes, 30 minute cooling,

1:34:16.100 --> 1:34:20.260
 20 minutes again, proceed with extreme caution,

1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:23.200
 but nonetheless, these are pretty extreme effects

1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:26.460
 in terms of their abilities to increase growth hormone

1:34:26.460 --> 1:34:27.360
 levels.

1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:29.460
 Along the lines of temperature and hormones,

1:34:29.460 --> 1:34:32.700
 I just want to mention a very recent study just came out

1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:36.100
 March, April, 2021, endocrine effects

1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:38.000
 of repeated hot thermal stress

1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.480
 and cold water immersion in young adult men.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:41.500
 Unfortunately, it was just in men.

1:34:41.500 --> 1:34:43.360
 They didn't look at women, but nonetheless,

1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:45.300
 I think the data are relevant to everybody

1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:46.600
 as a general theme.

1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:48.840
 This is Podstowski et al.

1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:52.500
 I will put a link to the study in the caption

1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:56.040
 and they looked at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol,

1:34:56.040 --> 1:34:57.060
 et cetera.

1:34:57.060 --> 1:35:01.860
 And what they found was that the sauna does indeed lead

1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:05.040
 to a significant decrease in cortisol, a stress hormone,

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:07.620
 a hormone that you want to be released early in the day

1:35:07.620 --> 1:35:08.740
 when you wake up,

1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:12.520
 but sauna definitely led to a significant decrease

1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:15.940
 in cortisol, but did not change testosterone, DHEA

1:35:15.940 --> 1:35:17.500
 or prolactin levels.

1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:19.080
 So that's interesting.

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:23.100
 And it turns out that the cold did affect

1:35:23.100 --> 1:35:24.620
 some of these hormones,

1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:27.600
 but the results there were a little bit more mixed.

1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:30.500
 So the takeaway here is that heat seems to have

1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:33.340
 positive effects on growth hormone, big effects.

1:35:33.340 --> 1:35:35.060
 It seems to have positive effects

1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:37.620
 on reducing cortisol levels.

1:35:37.620 --> 1:35:40.020
 And it does not seem to have effects on things

1:35:40.020 --> 1:35:42.780
 like testosterone, DHEA or prolactin directly.

1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:44.620
 You can imagine that a shift in any hormone

1:35:44.620 --> 1:35:47.180
 is going to alter the levels of other hormones

1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:49.400
 down the line, sort of indirect effects,

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:51.340
 but in terms of direct effects,

1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:54.820
 just during or immediately after the sauna bath,

1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:57.000
 there were no effects.

1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.540
 So we've talked about diet, supplementation,

1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:03.460
 behavioral tools, and of course,

1:36:03.460 --> 1:36:06.800
 we talked about the underlying biology and logic.

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:10.060
 And hopefully you heard the safety precautions

1:36:10.060 --> 1:36:11.820
 for all of those.

1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:14.880
 Now I'd like to just briefly talk about

1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:17.340
 the prescription side of all this.

1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:21.580
 There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone

1:36:21.580 --> 1:36:23.420
 because it's been prescribed to them by a doctor.

1:36:23.420 --> 1:36:25.580
 And presumably there are people taking growth hormone

1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:27.860
 even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor,

1:36:27.860 --> 1:36:30.020
 which is none of my business.

1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:34.580
 But the point here is that most all of the hormones

1:36:34.580 --> 1:36:37.260
 that we make have been synthesized.

1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:40.060
 So there are versions of them in little bottles

1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:42.780
 or little ampules that people can inject.

1:36:42.780 --> 1:36:44.760
 Here are a couple of important things to consider.

1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:46.860
 If you're going to go that route.

1:36:46.860 --> 1:36:49.260
 First of all, talk to a physician, right?

1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:52.360
 They actually are only legally available through a physician.

1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:55.700
 Second of all, anytime you're injecting something,

1:36:55.700 --> 1:36:57.540
 you're going to shut down your own production.

1:36:57.540 --> 1:36:59.380
 That's the way that the hormone system works.

1:36:59.380 --> 1:37:00.660
 If you take thyroid hormone,

1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:04.060
 you won't make thyroid hormone, at least in the long run.

1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:06.460
 If you take testosterone,

1:37:06.460 --> 1:37:09.500
 you will shut down your own production of testosterone.

1:37:09.500 --> 1:37:12.900
 If you take estrogen, the system's a little more resilient,

1:37:12.900 --> 1:37:14.140
 but eventually you will shut down

1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:15.680
 your production of estrogen.

1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:18.020
 And the same is true for growth hormone.

1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:22.420
 So a decision to go that route of taking something

1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:25.140
 is often not always a decision to do it forever.

1:37:25.140 --> 1:37:27.660
 However, if you're willing to sustain a period

1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:29.980
 of being without a given hormone,

1:37:29.980 --> 1:37:33.460
 some people can do things and then stop taking them

1:37:33.460 --> 1:37:35.420
 and then wait out the period

1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:37.980
 in which they're not making testosterone,

1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:40.180
 estrogen, or growth hormone, and then it will come back.

1:37:40.180 --> 1:37:41.920
 Sometimes, and sometimes it won't.

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:46.060
 There's a kind of new area that's developing now

1:37:46.060 --> 1:37:48.160
 that I think deserves our attention,

1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:51.320
 not because I'm encouraging it, but because it is happening.

1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.240
 And in keeping with the science

1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.000
 and in keeping with trying to keep things modern,

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.420
 it's worth us discussing, and those are peptides.

1:38:00.420 --> 1:38:02.960
 So these days you hear a lot about peptides.

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:06.000
 I'd like to clarify a little bit about what peptides are.

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.800
 Peptides is a really huge category of biological compounds.

1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:13.920
 Peptides are just strings of amino acids, right?

1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:16.400
 So we've talked about L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.

1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:17.240
 Those are amino acids.

1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:18.760
 Those are individual amino acids.

1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:22.960
 And those are put together into little small peptides

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:25.220
 or they're what are called polypeptides,

1:38:25.220 --> 1:38:27.040
 which are just longer peptides.

1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:31.320
 Turns out that for any substance like growth hormone

1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:32.920
 or growth hormone-releasing hormone,

1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:34.520
 it's made up of different amino acids

1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:36.960
 in different sequences, just like your genes are made up

1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:39.440
 of As and Gs and Cs and Ts,

1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:41.040
 nucleotides in different sequences.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.280
 It's like a recipe.

1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.080
 Peptides tend to be short sequences of amino acids

1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:50.760
 that resemble a hormone enough

1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:53.440
 or resemble some other peptide enough

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:55.960
 that it can lead to the similar or same effects

1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:57.100
 when you inject them.

1:38:57.100 --> 1:39:01.320
 So for example, we make growth hormone-releasing hormone

1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:03.220
 from our brain, which stimulates growth hormone

1:39:03.220 --> 1:39:04.060
 from the pituitary.

1:39:04.060 --> 1:39:07.060
 You're probably getting tired of me saying that by now.

1:39:07.060 --> 1:39:11.620
 But people now will take things like sermorelin,

1:39:11.620 --> 1:39:16.620
 S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,

1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:19.520
 which is not the entire peptide sequence

1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:21.460
 of growth hormone-releasing hormone,

1:39:21.460 --> 1:39:23.040
 but it's a subset of those.

1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:25.480
 And when people inject it before they go to sleep at night,

1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:27.600
 is typically how it's done on an empty stomach,

1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:30.160
 then that stimulates the release of growth hormone

1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:31.280
 from the pituitary.

1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:33.520
 So this is not taking growth hormone.

1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:36.040
 This is taking the stimulating hormone

1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:40.160
 or what's often called a secretagogue or a mimic, all right?

1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:44.020
 It causes a secretion of the hormone that one wants.

1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.720
 People will do this for thyroid hormone too.

1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:48.080
 Some people are doing this by prescription

1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:49.240
 with a real medical need.

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:52.120
 Other people are doing it for just longevity reasons,

1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:54.040
 which kind of falls into that gray zone

1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:55.760
 of they wouldn't die without it,

1:39:55.760 --> 1:39:57.480
 but they want to enhance their life.

1:39:57.480 --> 1:39:58.600
 And so they're doing that

1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:00.360
 because they believe it's the right thing for them.

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.060
 Prescription, sermorelin is prescription.

1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:03.960
 Do they work?

1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:05.480
 Yes.

1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:08.000
 Do they shut down your natural production

1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.720
 of growth hormone-releasing hormone?

1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:13.300
 Well, the answer is yes,

1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:16.360
 but some of these peptides actually have the effect

1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.380
 of changing gene expression.

1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:19.640
 Remember way back to the beginning

1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:21.000
 when I was talking about hormones,

1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:22.720
 they can actually change gene expression

1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:25.600
 and they can actually set pathways in motion

1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.540
 for continued production of a hormone

1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:29.880
 even if you stop taking the compound.

1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:31.740
 Now that can be good or that can be bad

1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:33.600
 because as you recall, growth hormone

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.000
 in big increases in growth hormone that are short-lived

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.840
 like sauna or I should say exercise or arginine or sauna,

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:43.700
 it seems like has these huge effects,

1:40:45.220 --> 1:40:49.120
 or early nights, first phase of sleep early in the night,

1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:50.880
 these sorts of things.

1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:52.700
 Those are transient,

1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:56.280
 but when one is injecting over and over a constant level,

1:40:56.280 --> 1:40:59.280
 you can put into action gene expression programs

1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:00.400
 that can be long-lived.

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:03.400
 And let's say you have a particular tumor in the body,

1:41:03.400 --> 1:41:05.540
 tumors will grow when they see growth hormone

1:41:05.540 --> 1:41:08.320
 even if that tumor is unhealthy for you, right?

1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:10.080
 You've got growth of tissues all over the body.

1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:11.400
 So again, I'm not saying whether or not

1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:13.080
 people should do these things or not doing them.

1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:16.700
 One thing I do know is that they are in very prominent use

1:41:16.700 --> 1:41:17.780
 in the movie industry,

1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:19.660
 people who want to peel off body fat quickly,

1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:22.920
 they do increase recovery time, they increase healing rates,

1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:26.160
 people are also injecting things like gastric peptides,

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:28.200
 they're actually stomach peptides

1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:30.040
 that we talked about in the previous episode,

1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:32.700
 things related to the ghrelin pathway

1:41:32.700 --> 1:41:34.420
 and other things from the liver

1:41:34.420 --> 1:41:37.600
 that can improve the rate of tissue and wound healing.

1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.920
 You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics,

1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:42.440
 a lot of people are using peptides and compounds

1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:44.800
 and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone in particular,

1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:47.280
 it's just this is separate from hormone augmentation

1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:50.000
 of like injecting gh or injecting testosterone.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.660
 People are now working further up the pathways.

1:41:52.660 --> 1:41:54.060
 Other names of some of the peptides

1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:58.920
 are things like hypermorulin, tessomorulin.

1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:00.840
 Some of these have clinical uses,

1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:04.120
 others have just been made as compounds for people

1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:06.760
 in the kind of longevity field

1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:09.600
 or the self-augmentation field, if you will.

1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:11.240
 So again, not promoting their use,

1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:12.200
 but they're definitely out there

1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.140
 and so now if you hear about them

1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:15.600
 or someone's talking to you about them,

1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.160
 now hopefully you have a better understanding

1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:18.580
 about their underlying biology

1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:20.740
 and you can think rationally about whether or not

1:42:20.740 --> 1:42:23.800
 they are the right decision for you.

1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:28.080
 Okay, once again, covered an enormous amount of material.

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.360
 Hopefully now you understand thyroid hormone

1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:32.740
 and what it does and a little bit about its mechanism

1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:35.320
 or maybe a lot and growth hormone and what it does

1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:38.920
 and how both of them take care of our metabolism.

1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:42.440
 They dictate how many nutrients we can eat and make use of.

1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:45.500
 They can pull from body fat stores, repair muscle,

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:48.520
 repair cartilage, they really are incredible compounds

1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:50.040
 and they are actionable.

1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:50.960
 They're things that we can do

1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:53.480
 like getting that early phase of sleep,

1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:56.620
 perhaps supplementing with arginine, maybe not,

1:42:56.620 --> 1:43:00.160
 hopefully getting adequate exercise, warming up properly,

1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:03.080
 not making the exercise too long or too intense will help,

1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:05.600
 maybe sauna or things like it,

1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:09.560
 deliberate safe hyperthermia, the emphasis on safe

1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:11.640
 might be things that are of use.

1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:13.960
 Regardless, even if you're not interested in the thyroid

1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:16.000
 or the growth hormone pathways,

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.240
 this brings to a close our month on hormones

1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:20.120
 and so now hopefully you understand

1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:21.640
 not just thyroid and growth hormone,

1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:24.320
 but the logic that underlies thyroid hormone,

1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:26.960
 growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone,

1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:31.160
 why we eat, why we stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin.

1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:33.040
 If these names don't mean anything to you,

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.120
 then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes

1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:37.760
 but regardless, I hope that you come away from this

1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:40.480
 with a deeper understanding about these hormones

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.800
 which are so powerful in controlling

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:44.200
 the way our brain functions

1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:46.640
 and the interplay between the brain and hormones

1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:50.080
 because it is really a bi-directional conversation.

1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:52.180
 The brain is telling the body what hormones to make,

1:43:52.180 --> 1:43:54.440
 the hormones are influencing all the tissues of the body

1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:56.760
 but also telling the brain whether or not to eat more

1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:59.920
 or grow more or think more, et cetera.

1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:02.760
 So I really appreciate your time and attention.

1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:42.100
 We release episodes every Monday

1:44:42.100 --> 1:44:44.800
 but sometimes we also release short clips in between.

1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:47.660
 That way you're sure to never miss an episode.

1:44:47.660 --> 1:44:49.480
 If you want to support us further,

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:51.200
 please check out the sponsors we talk about

1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:53.300
 at the beginning of the podcast episode.

1:44:53.300 --> 1:44:54.700
 That really helps us.

1:44:54.700 --> 1:44:56.460
 We also have a Patreon account.

1:44:56.460 --> 1:44:59.840
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:01.280
 There you can support the podcast

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:03.560
 at any level that you like.

1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:06.320
 And I mentioned supplements this episode.

1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:07.820
 I often mentioned supplements.

1:45:07.820 --> 1:45:09.400
 They are certainly not necessary

1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:11.280
 but for those of you interested in supplements,

1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:14.620
 we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E

1:45:14.620 --> 1:45:17.180
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

1:45:17.180 --> 1:45:19.140
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients

1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:21.100
 and the amount of the ingredients

1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:24.620
 in each capsule, tablet, powder, et cetera.

1:45:24.620 --> 1:45:26.920
 If you want to see the supplements that I take

1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:28.840
 as well as get a discount on any of those

1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:31.200
 or any of the supplements that Thorne makes,

1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:36.200
 it's thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman

1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:40.240
 and you can get 20% off any of the supplements they make.

1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:43.120
 I should mention Thorne works with the Mayo Clinic.

1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:44.080
 They partnered with them.

1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:45.880
 They work with all the major sports teams.

1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:47.960
 So really the highest levels of stringency.

1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:50.200
 We're quite happy to be working with them.

1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:52.080
 And last but not least,

1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:53.840
 I thank you for your time and attention

1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:56.140
 and above all for your interest in science.
