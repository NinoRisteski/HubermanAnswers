00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.280
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.280 --> 00:13.220
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.220 --> 00:15.040
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.640
 Today, my guest is Dr. Casey Halpern.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.640
 Dr. Halpern is the chief of neurosurgery

00:19.640 --> 00:22.580
 at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

00:22.580 --> 00:26.560
 His laboratory focuses on bulimia, binge eating disorder,

00:26.560 --> 00:29.500
 and other forms of obsessive compulsive behaviors.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.380
 Normally, when we hear about eating disorders

00:31.380 --> 00:33.960
 or obsessive compulsive disorders of other kinds,

00:33.960 --> 00:35.460
 the conversation quickly migrates

00:35.460 --> 00:39.480
 to pharmacologic interventions and serotonin or dopamine

00:39.480 --> 00:41.160
 or talk therapy interventions,

00:41.160 --> 00:43.300
 many of which can be effective.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.680
 The Halpern Laboratory, however,

00:44.680 --> 00:46.440
 takes an entirely different approach.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.600
 While they embrace pharmacologic and behavioral

00:48.600 --> 00:50.120
 and talk therapy interventions,

00:50.120 --> 00:53.120
 their main focus is the development and application

00:53.120 --> 00:56.000
 of engineered devices to go directly into the brain

00:56.000 --> 00:58.200
 and stimulate the neurons, the nerve cells,

00:58.200 --> 00:59.920
 that generate compulsions,

00:59.920 --> 01:02.520
 that cause people to want to eat more

01:02.520 --> 01:04.720
 even when their stomach is full.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.960
 In other words, they do brain surgery of various kinds,

01:07.960 --> 01:09.780
 sometimes removing small bits of brain,

01:09.780 --> 01:12.020
 sometimes stimulating small bits of brain

01:12.020 --> 01:13.120
 with electrical current,

01:13.120 --> 01:16.240
 and even stimulating the brain through the intact skull,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.520
 that is, without having to drill down beneath the skull

01:18.520 --> 01:19.680
 in order to alleviate

01:19.680 --> 01:22.160
 and indeed sometimes cure these conditions.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.600
 Today's discussion with Dr. Halpern

01:23.600 --> 01:25.920
 was an absolutely fascinating one for me

01:25.920 --> 01:28.000
 because it represents the leading edge

01:28.000 --> 01:30.640
 of what's happening in modification of brain circuits

01:30.640 --> 01:33.840
 and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.360
 For instance, they just recently published a paper

01:36.360 --> 01:40.120
 in Nature Medicine, one of the premier journals out there

01:40.120 --> 01:43.200
 entitled Pilot Study of Responsive Nucleus Accumbens

01:43.200 --> 01:45.920
 Deep Brain Stimulation for Loss of Control Eating.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.780
 The nucleus accumbens is an area of our brains

01:48.780 --> 01:50.520
 that we all have, in fact, we have two of them,

01:50.520 --> 01:52.180
 one on each side of the brain,

01:52.180 --> 01:55.480
 that is intimately involved in the release of dopamine

01:55.480 --> 01:57.480
 for particular motivated behaviors.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.080
 And while most often we think about dopamine

01:59.080 --> 02:01.720
 for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in,

02:01.720 --> 02:04.820
 in this context, they are using stimulation

02:04.820 --> 02:07.720
 and control of neuronal activity in nucleus accumbens

02:07.720 --> 02:10.160
 to control loss of control eating,

02:10.160 --> 02:11.960
 something that when people suffer from it,

02:11.960 --> 02:13.720
 despite knowing that they shouldn't eat,

02:13.720 --> 02:15.180
 despite not even wanting to eat,

02:15.180 --> 02:16.680
 they find themselves eating.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.120
 So again, this represents really the leading edge

02:19.120 --> 02:20.760
 of where neuroscience is going,

02:20.760 --> 02:22.700
 and it certainly is going to be an area of neuroscience

02:22.700 --> 02:24.600
 that's going to expand in the years to come.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.320
 And Dr. Halpern and the members of his laboratory

02:27.320 --> 02:30.280
 are among a very small group of scientists in the world

02:30.280 --> 02:31.640
 that are using the types of approaches

02:31.640 --> 02:33.080
 that I described a minute ago,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.320
 and that you're going to hear more about in today's episode

02:35.320 --> 02:37.540
 in order to resolve some of the most difficult

02:37.540 --> 02:39.560
 and debilitating human conditions.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.480
 During today's discussion, you will also learn

02:41.480 --> 02:44.440
 about the use of deep brain stimulation and other approaches

02:44.440 --> 02:46.480
 for the treatment of movement disorders,

02:46.480 --> 02:49.120
 such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease,

02:49.120 --> 02:50.840
 and various types of dystonias,

02:50.840 --> 02:52.640
 which are challenges in generating

02:52.640 --> 02:54.240
 particular types of movement.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.600
 So whether or not you or somebody that you know

02:56.600 --> 02:58.120
 suffers from an eating disorder,

02:58.120 --> 02:59.920
 from obsessive compulsive disorder,

02:59.920 --> 03:01.480
 or from a movement disorder,

03:01.480 --> 03:03.400
 today's episode is sure to teach you

03:03.400 --> 03:05.880
 not only about what's happening in those arenas,

03:05.880 --> 03:08.720
 but also in the arenas of neuroscience generally.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.160
 In fact, I would say today's episode

03:10.160 --> 03:11.640
 is especially important for anyone

03:11.640 --> 03:14.280
 that wants to understand how the brain works

03:14.280 --> 03:16.780
 and what the future of brain modification

03:16.780 --> 03:19.120
 really looks like for all of us.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.860
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:21.860 --> 03:24.640
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.920
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:26.920 --> 03:29.520
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:29.520 --> 03:32.360
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.420
 In keeping with that theme,

03:33.420 --> 03:36.200
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.200
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.240
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:40.240 --> 03:42.200
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.280
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

03:44.280 --> 03:46.880
 from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses

03:46.880 --> 03:50.560
 and sunglasses were created with performance in mind.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.480
 I've spent a lifetime working on the biology

03:52.480 --> 03:53.720
 of the visual system, and I can tell you

03:53.720 --> 03:55.260
 that your visual system has to contend

03:55.260 --> 03:57.200
 with a number of very important challenges

03:57.200 --> 03:59.180
 in order for you to be able to see clearly.

03:59.180 --> 04:01.140
 For instance, when you go from a sunny area

04:01.140 --> 04:03.120
 to a more shaded area and then back out again.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.720
 It's a very complex process.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.400
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were built,

04:07.400 --> 04:10.320
 that is engineered, with that sort of biology in mind.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.140
 And as a consequence, no matter where you are wearing them

04:13.140 --> 04:14.220
 and where you happen to be,

04:14.220 --> 04:16.440
 you always see through them with crystal clarity.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.600
 The aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:18.600 --> 04:19.960
 is also worth mentioning.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.200
 Unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there,

04:22.200 --> 04:25.080
 which only come in the kind of cyborg variety,

04:25.080 --> 04:27.280
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in those varieties,

04:27.280 --> 04:28.760
 but they also come in varieties

04:28.760 --> 04:30.800
 that you would feel very comfortable wearing out to dinner

04:30.800 --> 04:33.540
 or to work or to school, really anywhere that you go.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.120
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,

04:35.120 --> 04:37.680

04:43.480 --> 04:45.840
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.440
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.800
 Eight Sleep makes mattress covers

04:49.800 --> 04:52.440
 with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking ability.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.800
 I've talked many times before on this podcast

04:54.800 --> 04:57.000
 about the close relationship between temperature

04:57.000 --> 05:00.080
 and your ability to stay asleep and emerge from sleep.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.640
 The way Eight Sleep mattress covers work

05:01.640 --> 05:03.680
 is that they allow you to program the temperature

05:03.680 --> 05:07.360
 of your mattress so that you can fall asleep quickly,

05:07.360 --> 05:09.520
 get into deep sleep, stay in deep sleep,

05:09.520 --> 05:12.260
 and emerge from that sleep feeling especially rested

05:12.260 --> 05:14.360
 by dropping the temperature of that surface

05:14.360 --> 05:16.680
 by one to three degrees at the beginning of the night,

05:16.680 --> 05:18.560
 dropping it a little bit further into the night,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.280
 and then raising the temperature towards morning

05:20.280 --> 05:22.320
 because waking up requires that one to three degree

05:22.320 --> 05:24.600
 re-increase in body temperature.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.440
 I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover

05:26.440 --> 05:28.200
 for the last six months or so now,

05:28.200 --> 05:32.640
 and I can assert that it is the absolute biggest game changer

05:32.640 --> 05:34.460
 in the quality and duration of my sleep.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.940
 In fact, I don't really like traveling as much as I used to

05:36.940 --> 05:39.060
 because the Eight Sleep doesn't go with me

05:39.060 --> 05:41.480
 and they don't seem to have them yet in Airbnbs and hotels.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.760
 So this is also a call to action.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.120
 Airbnbs and hotels, please put Eight Sleep mattresses

05:46.120 --> 05:49.600
 on your beds and I'll be more apt to stay in those hotels

05:49.600 --> 05:51.020
 and Airbnbs.

05:51.020 --> 05:51.860
 With that said,

05:51.860 --> 05:53.720
 if you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,

05:53.720 --> 05:56.500
 you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman,

 And please note that Eight Sleep currently ships

06:04.320 --> 06:07.640
 in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU

06:07.640 --> 06:08.560
 and Australia.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.460
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.780
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:17.780 --> 06:20.360
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:20.360 --> 06:21.880
 to help you better understand your body

06:21.880 --> 06:23.760
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.940
 Now I've long been a believer

06:24.940 --> 06:26.300
 in getting regular blood work done

06:26.300 --> 06:28.760
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:28.760 --> 06:31.000
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:31.000 --> 06:33.420
 can only be assessed with a quality blood test.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.340
 One of the major issues with the various blood tests

06:35.340 --> 06:38.440
 out there is that you get information back about lipids

06:38.440 --> 06:40.960
 and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,

06:40.960 --> 06:43.120
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.080
 With Inside Tracker, they make knowing what to do

06:45.080 --> 06:47.800
 with the information you get about your biological health

06:47.800 --> 06:48.880
 extremely easy.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.200
 They have this very easy to use dashboard

06:51.200 --> 06:53.240
 and that dashboard tells you, for instance,

06:53.240 --> 06:54.860
 what to change in your nutrition,

06:54.860 --> 06:58.000
 what supplements you may want or may not want to take

06:58.000 --> 07:00.340
 as well as other behavioral and other types of interventions

07:00.340 --> 07:02.240
 that can allow you to move those numbers

07:02.240 --> 07:04.880
 related to metabolic hormone and other factors

07:04.880 --> 07:06.640
 into the precise range that's optimal

07:06.640 --> 07:08.560
 for your immediate and long-term health.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.920
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:09.920 --> 07:12.800
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

 to get 20% off.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.660
 On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

07:21.660 --> 07:23.200
 we talk about supplements.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.320
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.840
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.480
 Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep

07:30.480 --> 07:33.220
 or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability

07:33.220 --> 07:36.500
 or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels

07:36.500 --> 07:38.080
 to optimal range for you.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.800
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered

07:39.800 --> 07:41.160
 with Momentous Supplements.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.820
 We partner with Momentous for a number of important reasons.

07:43.820 --> 07:46.260
 First of all, the quality of their ingredients

07:46.260 --> 07:48.540
 is exceptional, it's really second to none.

07:48.540 --> 07:50.320
 Second of all, they ship internationally

07:50.320 --> 07:51.400
 and that was important to us

07:51.400 --> 07:53.040
 because a number of you reside outside

07:53.040 --> 07:54.120
 of the United States.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.660
 Third, we've worked with Momentous very closely

07:56.660 --> 07:59.080
 to develop single ingredient formulations.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.000
 Now, this turns out to be very important

08:01.000 --> 08:03.200
 because if you're going to take supplements,

08:03.200 --> 08:05.600
 you want to know what's working for you and what isn't.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.800
 And of course, you want to optimize the cost efficiency

08:08.800 --> 08:11.840
 and the biological efficiency of those supplements.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.160
 To find the supplements we discuss

08:13.160 --> 08:14.360
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

08:14.360 --> 08:17.000
 you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.560
 livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.960
 And I should just mention that the library

08:20.960 --> 08:23.140
 of those supplements is constantly expanding.

08:23.140 --> 08:26.220
 Again, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

08:26.220 --> 08:29.400
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern.

08:29.400 --> 08:34.220
 Casey, I should say Dr. Halpern for those listening, welcome.

08:34.220 --> 08:35.280
 Thank you, great to be here.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.580
 Yeah, it's been a long time coming.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.740
 We were colleagues at Stanford.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.600
 And then recently you moved, of course,

08:41.600 --> 08:43.120
 to University of Pennsylvania,

08:43.120 --> 08:44.760
 also an incredible institution.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.520
 We're sorry to lose you.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.720
 It was bittersweet for me too.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.920
 Stanford's loss is UPenn's gain.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.480
 But let's talk about your work, past and present.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.960
 As I've told the listeners already,

08:57.960 --> 08:59.080
 you're a neurosurgeon,

08:59.080 --> 09:01.640
 which I consider the astronauts of neuroscience

09:01.640 --> 09:04.520
 because you're in somewhat uncharted territory

09:04.520 --> 09:05.840
 or very uncharted territory.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.760
 And yet precision is everything, right?

09:08.760 --> 09:12.320
 The margins of error are very, very small.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.800
 So for those that aren't familiar with the differences

09:14.800 --> 09:17.760
 between neurosurgery, neurology, psychiatry,

09:17.760 --> 09:19.720
 you just educate us a bit.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.760
 What does a neurosurgeon do?

09:21.760 --> 09:26.080
 And what does the fact that you're a neurosurgeon

09:26.080 --> 09:27.840
 do for your view of the brain?

09:27.840 --> 09:30.800
 How do you think about and conceptualize the brain?

09:30.800 --> 09:34.480
 Yeah, the scope of neurosurgery is quite broad.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.320
 When I was in medical school, I was drawn to neurosurgery

09:37.320 --> 09:40.620
 because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.960
 When I was at Penn as a college student,

09:42.960 --> 09:45.800
 I actually watched my first deep brain stimulation surgery

09:45.800 --> 09:47.000
 performed by Gordon Baltuck,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.300
 who to date is one of my career mentors.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.480
 Deep brain stimulation is one surgery

09:53.480 --> 09:55.000
 that neurosurgeons offer,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.960
 but it's actually sort of a very small minority

09:58.960 --> 10:01.200
 of what neurosurgery does.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.760
 So we take out brain tumors,

10:04.760 --> 10:06.820
 we clip aneurysms in the brain,

10:07.880 --> 10:09.200
 we take care of patients

10:09.200 --> 10:11.080
 that have had traumatic brain injury,

10:11.080 --> 10:14.000
 concussion, spine surgeries,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.680
 90% of what neurosurgeons do around the country,

10:17.600 --> 10:21.020
 taking care of herniated discs and lumbar fusions.

10:21.020 --> 10:26.020
 So the scope is the entire central nervous system,

10:26.200 --> 10:27.960
 including the peripheral nervous system,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.000
 we take care of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome

10:30.000 --> 10:31.360
 and nerve disorders.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.220
 Now, over the course of the past two decades or so,

10:35.220 --> 10:39.300
 there's been a mission in the field to subspecialize.

10:39.300 --> 10:43.120
 And so historically, neurosurgeons did everything

10:43.120 --> 10:46.160
 in that domain, but now we subspecialize

10:46.160 --> 10:48.540
 and I'm lucky to be at Penn Medicine

10:48.540 --> 10:53.540
 where we can focus on one of these areas.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.240
 So I'm chief of stereotactic functional neurosurgery.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.800
 All I do is deep brain stimulation surgery

11:00.800 --> 11:02.880
 and a compliment to that is focus ultrasound

11:02.880 --> 11:05.140
 or transcranial focus ultrasound,

11:05.140 --> 11:08.480
 which is a non-invasive way to do an ablation in the brain,

11:08.480 --> 11:10.160
 recently FDA approved,

11:10.160 --> 11:12.560
 and it's FDA approved for tremor at the moment.

11:13.480 --> 11:18.480
 These two procedures are for me, my every day,

11:18.800 --> 11:23.140
 but still the minority of what neurosurgeons have to offer.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.760
 The majority of neurosurgery in my mind

11:25.760 --> 11:30.560
 is a bit more structural than it is physiology

11:30.560 --> 11:35.440
 or deeply rooted in how the brain functions.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.600
 When we take out a brain tumor,

11:36.600 --> 11:40.960
 we have to find a safe trajectory to get to the brain tumor

11:40.960 --> 11:42.320
 and then we remove it

11:42.320 --> 11:45.240
 and we help the patient recover in the ICU,

11:45.240 --> 11:46.680
 similar to a brain aneurysm.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.160
 Often we don't have to go into the brain

11:48.160 --> 11:50.520
 to clip a brain aneurysm, but we go around the brain

11:50.520 --> 11:52.780
 or under the brain to get there.

11:52.780 --> 11:56.480
 And in my mind, those surgeries are a bit more structural.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.160
 Deep brain stimulation, the surgery that I do routinely,

12:00.160 --> 12:04.740
 is a procedure where, yes, there is structure involved.

12:04.740 --> 12:08.500
 Of course, we have to place a very thin wire

12:08.500 --> 12:12.000
 that's insulated deep into a part of the brain

12:12.000 --> 12:15.040
 that's involved in Parkinson's disease, for example.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.160
 But that's actually not the therapy.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.600
 The therapy is delivering electrical stimulation

12:21.600 --> 12:24.680
 through the tip of that wire or one of the tips,

12:24.680 --> 12:26.540
 as there actually are multiple contacts

12:26.540 --> 12:27.880
 at the bottom of the wire.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.880
 They're very small.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.920
 But that's all done out of the operating room.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.720
 This stimulation wire is connected to a battery pack

12:36.720 --> 12:39.560
 or a pulse generator that's kind of like a pacemaker.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.720
 And so we deliver this therapy and I always tell patients,

12:42.720 --> 12:47.040
 it's a bit more like I have to implant a tool

12:47.040 --> 12:48.900
 to deliver you a medication,

12:48.900 --> 12:51.680
 but that medication is gonna be in the form of electricity

12:51.680 --> 12:52.560
 and it's gonna be delivered

12:52.560 --> 12:54.960
 into a very small region of the brain.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.100
 And it's that procedure that's inspired me

12:57.100 --> 12:59.040
 to not just become a neurosurgeon,

12:59.040 --> 13:02.600
 but has really defined the focus

13:02.600 --> 13:04.300
 of my research laboratory as well.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.880
 Maybe by way of anecdote,

13:08.880 --> 13:13.880
 you could tell us one of the more outrageous or surprising,

13:14.660 --> 13:17.460
 or who knows, delightful and thrilling things

13:17.460 --> 13:19.640
 about the brain that you've observed

13:19.640 --> 13:22.520
 as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas.

13:22.520 --> 13:26.920
 In textbooks, we always hear about the kind of dark stuff,

13:26.920 --> 13:29.400
 stimulate one brain area, somebody goes into a rage,

13:29.400 --> 13:31.080
 stimulate another brain area,

13:31.080 --> 13:33.680
 person starts laughing uncontrollably.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.920
 First of all, given that some of the information,

13:36.920 --> 13:37.760
 let's hope not much,

13:37.760 --> 13:40.540
 but some of the information in textbooks is incorrect,

13:40.540 --> 13:41.920
 are those sorts of statements true?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.760
 Can one observe those in the clinic?

13:43.760 --> 13:47.180
 And what are some of the more interesting

13:47.180 --> 13:49.280
 and I don't necessarily mean entertaining,

13:49.280 --> 13:51.460
 but surprising things that you've seen

13:51.460 --> 13:53.880
 when you've poked around in the brain,

13:53.880 --> 13:55.060
 deliberately, of course.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.420
 And what have you seen?

13:57.420 --> 13:58.920
 What have you heard?

13:58.920 --> 14:03.160
 I have to say, I am amazed by these effects every day.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.480
 Yeah, I'm very privileged to be able to interact

14:05.480 --> 14:06.720
 with the human brain in this way.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.800
 It's always with the goal of trying to provide somebody

14:10.800 --> 14:11.960
 with a meaningful therapy.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.200
 But when we deliver electrical stimulation,

14:14.200 --> 14:17.920
 these electrodes, while they might be sitting

14:17.920 --> 14:19.500
 in a very small region of the brain,

14:19.500 --> 14:22.440
 there are regions within a few millimeters

14:22.440 --> 14:24.880
 of where these electrodes are that, if stimulated,

14:24.880 --> 14:28.160
 could cause a temporary, very brief side effect,

14:28.160 --> 14:29.760
 a moment of laughter, like you said,

14:29.760 --> 14:31.200
 or a moment of panic.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.720
 And of course, we can just shut that electrode off.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.240
 But often, these side effects could be therapeutic.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.480
 And actually, that's how we have discovered ways

14:39.480 --> 14:42.160
 to use deep brain stimulation,

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
 not just for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease,

14:44.320 --> 14:47.000
 but for example, patients with Parkinson's disease

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
 that have a psychiatric comorbidity like depression

14:52.760 --> 14:54.880
 or obsessive compulsive disorder.

14:54.880 --> 14:59.120
 A lot of these patients are highly compulsive and impulsive.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.580
 Sometimes, these problems actually melt away.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.140
 And we're trying to help their tremor,

15:05.140 --> 15:07.840
 but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue

15:07.840 --> 15:10.240
 has gotten better or their mood has improved.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.080
 And why is that?

15:11.080 --> 15:13.800
 Well, there's probably more than one reason.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.040
 You can help somebody's mood

15:15.040 --> 15:17.180
 by making their tremor go away, of course,

15:17.180 --> 15:20.020
 but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes.

15:20.020 --> 15:20.860
 And why is that?

15:20.860 --> 15:23.580
 And that's because we're stimulating parts of the brain

15:23.580 --> 15:26.000
 that are not just involved in these motor circuits,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.120
 but they're also involved in what we call a limbic circuit

15:29.120 --> 15:31.120
 or part of the brain involved in emotion.

15:31.120 --> 15:35.860
 And if we learn how to modulate those areas therapeutically,

15:35.860 --> 15:38.360
 step-by-step, we can actually develop these therapies

15:38.360 --> 15:40.840
 for other indications like depression.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.040
 I would say the most impressive and consistent effect

15:44.040 --> 15:46.200
 we have when we have a patient with tremor

15:46.200 --> 15:48.160
 who has been tremoring for the past 20 years,

15:48.160 --> 15:50.360
 if we can deliver stimulation through that electrode

15:50.360 --> 15:52.920
 in the clinic, we have immediate relief of tremor.

15:52.920 --> 15:56.040
 And that is the effect that inspired me

15:56.040 --> 15:57.960
 to be a neurosurgeon when I was in college.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.400
 I've never really wanted to do anything else

16:00.400 --> 16:03.720
 except help develop that type of therapeutic

16:03.720 --> 16:06.440
 for another kind of symptom.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.960
 I'm very interested in obesity and related eating disorders,

16:09.960 --> 16:14.640
 compulsive behavior, the urge to have something

16:14.640 --> 16:18.920
 that might be delicious but dangerous or unhealthy

16:18.920 --> 16:23.920
 or a drug or a compulsion like we see in OCD

16:24.400 --> 16:26.000
 or obsessive compulsive disorder.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.280
 Interestingly, like we see tremor melt away

16:30.280 --> 16:34.000
 when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.140
 we can see these more psychiatric problems.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.600
 They're not all psychiatric disorders,

16:38.600 --> 16:42.160
 but let's say disorders of the brain,

16:42.160 --> 16:44.640
 we can see symptoms of those disorders also improve

16:44.640 --> 16:47.360
 and often immediately, just like we do with tremor.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.720
 So I see it all the time.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.080
 To pick out one would be a challenge

16:53.080 --> 16:55.780
 because for me, this is my everyday.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.400
 The speed of the relief that you described for tremor

16:59.400 --> 17:02.480
 is really incredible.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.960
 Just thinking about drug therapies

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
 and there too, there are side effects,

17:05.960 --> 17:08.880
 but there are still a lot of mysteries

17:08.880 --> 17:13.120
 as to, for instance, why SSRIs even work when they work.

17:13.120 --> 17:13.960
 And-

17:13.960 --> 17:16.620
 The timing is always a challenge.

17:16.620 --> 17:18.780
 Timing, dosage, yes, absolutely.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.300
 I'd love to learn more from you about OCD.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.140
 I have several reasons for asking this.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.400
 First of all, I'm a somewhat obsessive person.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.960
 I tend to be very narrowly focused,

17:30.960 --> 17:33.160
 although I confess it's not a step function.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.920
 It takes me some time to turn off the chatter,

17:34.920 --> 17:36.500
 but once I'm into a thought train

17:36.500 --> 17:40.600
 or a mode of being and thinking and work,

17:40.600 --> 17:42.920
 it's very hard for me to exit that mode.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.000
 It's like a deep trench.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.440
 Adaptive in some circumstances, less adaptive.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.640
 In others, as you know.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.280
 The other is that when I was a kid,

17:50.280 --> 17:52.600
 I had a little bit of a grunting tic.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.600
 I used to, I had this intense, intense desire

17:56.600 --> 18:01.600
 to clear my throat to the point where my dad said,

18:01.640 --> 18:02.480
 you need to stop that.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.220
 He used to squeeze my hand every time I do it.

18:04.220 --> 18:05.920
 And I used to hide in the backseat of the car

18:05.920 --> 18:07.000
 or in the closet to do it

18:07.000 --> 18:09.460
 because it provided so much relief.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.800
 And then it eventually passed.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.760
 I wasn't medicated.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.400
 They never did anything about it.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.120
 Every once in a while now, if I'm very fatigued,

18:17.120 --> 18:20.000
 if I've been working a lot, I notice it starts to come back.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.680
 I'll do this like kind of grunting.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.880
 And so it's been sort of like a pet neurological symptom

18:25.880 --> 18:29.300
 for me that reminds me that these circuits exist

18:29.300 --> 18:32.920
 in all of us and that sometimes they go haywire

18:32.920 --> 18:35.440
 and sometimes they just have subtle, you know,

18:35.440 --> 18:37.840
 overexcitation or something of that sort.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.600
 And then the third reason is that I get thousands

18:40.600 --> 18:42.160
 of questions about OCD.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.960
 Could you perhaps just tell us what is OCD?

18:44.960 --> 18:46.120
 Sure.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.140
 What are some brain areas involved?

18:48.140 --> 18:50.720
 What are the current range of treatments?

18:50.720 --> 18:54.800
 And what's the difference between someone who is obsessive

18:54.800 --> 18:57.840
 and somebody who has true OCD?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.600
 So a brief disclosure, as a neurosurgeon,

19:00.600 --> 19:03.160
 I do take care of patients with severe obsessive

19:03.160 --> 19:04.340
 compulsive disorder.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.680
 But my perspective on OCD may be a little bit different

19:08.680 --> 19:12.200
 than a psychiatrist who lives and breathes OCD

19:12.200 --> 19:15.560
 and sees patients every single day with OCD.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.160
 I probably take care of three to five patients a year

19:19.160 --> 19:20.200
 with deep brain stimulation

19:20.200 --> 19:22.280
 for obsessive compulsive disorder.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.120
 So I don't see these patients as routinely,

19:24.120 --> 19:27.760
 but my laboratory is geared as a researcher.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.120
 I'm very focused on trying to improve outcomes

19:31.120 --> 19:33.760
 of deep brain stimulation for OCD.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.780
 So I do feel I have expertise and a perspective to share,

19:37.780 --> 19:39.420
 but just a brief disclosure.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.040
 I do feel that as a neurosurgeon,

19:46.040 --> 19:49.600
 I am obligated to better understand

19:49.600 --> 19:51.860
 where the obsessions in the brain come from

19:51.860 --> 19:54.560
 and how we can interrupt them to stop the compulsion

19:54.560 --> 19:57.240
 that's associated with the obsession,

19:57.240 --> 20:01.160
 sort of the intrinsic most feature of OCD,

20:02.320 --> 20:04.440
 better than we're actually doing it.

20:04.440 --> 20:08.560
 For example, if we were to offer a patient with tremor,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.160
 deep brain stimulation surgery,

20:10.160 --> 20:12.000
 of course there's some risk to the procedure,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.760
 but the outcome is so consistent and positive

20:15.760 --> 20:18.400
 that many patients are willing to take on that risk.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.600
 For obsessive compulsive disorder,

20:22.600 --> 20:26.840
 the surgery risk is about the same.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.520
 However, the benefit is not quite as robust.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.700
 And so a lot of patients,

20:31.700 --> 20:33.060
 and they're referring psychiatrists,

20:33.060 --> 20:35.740
 are reluctant to refer these patients to us,

20:35.740 --> 20:38.160
 and it's completely understandable.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.520
 I've been leading an endeavor

20:40.520 --> 20:42.280
 with a number of collaborators around the country

20:42.280 --> 20:47.280
 to try to better understand these circuits in the brain,

20:48.120 --> 20:51.560
 study them in humans, both invasively and noninvasively.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.200
 That would be with an electrode-based surgery,

20:54.200 --> 20:55.320
 sort of like we do in epilepsy,

20:55.320 --> 20:57.120
 understand where seizures come from,

20:57.120 --> 20:59.200
 we wanna understand better where obsessions come from,

20:59.200 --> 21:01.120
 but we're also working with imaging experts

21:01.120 --> 21:03.880
 and geneticists to understand OCD

21:03.880 --> 21:05.400
 at a broader level as well.

21:06.920 --> 21:11.920
 I consider OCD to be a spectrum disorder in a way,

21:11.960 --> 21:16.100
 and I apologize to those who might feel

21:16.100 --> 21:17.920
 that I'm using that term incorrectly.

21:17.920 --> 21:22.220
 I'm using it in a way to describe patients

21:22.220 --> 21:25.020
 that have obsessions and even some related compulsions.

21:25.020 --> 21:28.080
 It might not meet criteria for OCD.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.520
 It may be something, Andrew, that you have,

21:30.520 --> 21:34.080
 and as a neurosurgeon, I'm really obsessive about safety

21:34.080 --> 21:36.560
 and compulsive about my surgical procedures.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.020
 So I think that some aspect of OCD,

21:40.020 --> 21:41.320
 which we often joke about,

21:41.320 --> 21:43.100
 but we should consider seriously,

21:43.100 --> 21:45.560
 because people do suffer from this,

21:45.560 --> 21:47.780
 some aspect of it helps us.

21:47.780 --> 21:51.200
 There are famous CEOs

21:51.200 --> 21:55.320
 that probably have some level of OCD, surgeons

21:55.320 --> 21:56.480
 and scientists alike.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.540
 So perhaps if it can be controlled, it's an asset,

22:02.320 --> 22:05.060
 but if it goes awry and is uncontrollable,

22:05.060 --> 22:08.000
 then it becomes obsessive compulsive disorder.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.600
 And I tend to see the patients that are the most severe,

22:11.600 --> 22:13.480
 so they have failed medication,

22:13.480 --> 22:15.200
 and there are multiple medications

22:15.200 --> 22:16.520
 that are worth trying for OCD.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.560
 Some can actually be very helpful.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.360
 Which neurotransmitter systems do they tend to poke at?

22:21.360 --> 22:25.480
 Well, SSRIs are sort of the first line for OCD,

22:25.480 --> 22:27.160
 but also tricyclics can be helpful.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.060
 So this is still the serotonin system.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.000
 But as we know, the serotonin system interacts

22:32.000 --> 22:36.160
 with the neuro-genergic system and the dopamine system.

22:36.160 --> 22:41.160
 So it's hard to be specific to one of these things.

22:41.540 --> 22:43.600
 And I think that's also why it's hard for us

22:43.600 --> 22:46.760
 to predict how these medications are going to work

22:46.760 --> 22:48.120
 for these kinds of patients.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.200
 But tricyclics and SSRIs can be very helpful

22:51.200 --> 22:53.000
 and are definitely first line.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.660
 And there's others.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.900
 Exposure response prevention

22:56.900 --> 22:59.760
 is probably the most effective option,

22:59.760 --> 23:01.680
 which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy,

23:01.680 --> 23:04.240
 but these are different and offered by psychologists.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.160
 And this is a whole field.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.620
 And there's a field, or I should say a whole clinic

23:09.620 --> 23:14.620
 at my institution focused, started by Ed Nafoa at Penn,

23:14.620 --> 23:19.620
 who this is what they do for these patients,

23:20.220 --> 23:22.980
 is offer these types of cognitive therapies,

23:22.980 --> 23:26.620
 exposure to the stressor and to try to get patients

23:26.620 --> 23:28.940
 to habituate to whatever it is that stresses them

23:28.940 --> 23:32.700
 and causes these compulsions to help these patients

23:32.700 --> 23:35.140
 live in every day and function.

23:35.140 --> 23:39.000
 These are all fabulously helpful therapies

23:39.000 --> 23:40.340
 for a variety of patients,

23:40.340 --> 23:42.640
 but there's still about 30% of patients

23:42.640 --> 23:46.220
 that still suffer from OCD and some of them have severe OCD.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.020
 Sometimes it's moderate to severe.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.020
 And those are the patients

23:49.020 --> 23:51.580
 that I'm really motivated to try to help.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.420
 Our therapies for those patients right now,

23:54.420 --> 23:58.420
 I would say are worth pursuing, but not optimal.

23:59.260 --> 24:00.940
 And so it's one of those things

24:00.940 --> 24:02.420
 that we have to balance as a researcher,

24:02.420 --> 24:04.520
 because when you see patients like this,

24:04.520 --> 24:05.780
 you wanna do everything you can to help them.

24:05.780 --> 24:08.060
 And I think it's important to educate patients

24:08.060 --> 24:09.640
 on the risks and benefits of them.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.560
 This is deep brain stimulation surgery,

24:11.560 --> 24:14.860
 but also capsulotomy, which is more of an ablation approach,

24:14.860 --> 24:16.520
 a little bit like deep brain stimulation,

24:16.520 --> 24:19.060
 but rather than delivering stimulation through an electrode,

24:19.060 --> 24:22.180
 you can actually heat the tissue and even destroy it.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.660
 Some would say this part of the brain

24:23.660 --> 24:25.140
 is very safe to destroy.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.620
 It's kind of like an appendix.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.480
 Others would say it's safer to modulate.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.980
 I have seen patients do very well with these ablations.

24:32.980 --> 24:35.220
 And so, you asked me earlier

24:35.220 --> 24:37.140
 what I find so amazing about the brain,

24:37.140 --> 24:38.420
 these effects that we can have.

24:38.420 --> 24:41.700
 Sometimes the lack of effect is what's so amazing.

24:41.700 --> 24:44.920
 You can actually traverse parts of the brain

24:44.920 --> 24:48.220
 without having any adverse effects on patients' function,

24:48.220 --> 24:50.460
 at least that you can test,

24:50.460 --> 24:52.460
 but you can also destroy small parts of the brain.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.700
 We're talking three or four millimeters in size.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.460
 These little ablations can be really helpful for patients,

24:57.460 --> 25:00.180
 but have no obvious side effects that we can tell,

25:00.180 --> 25:03.100
 perhaps after a short recovery from surgery.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.820
 But nonetheless, despite how safe they might be,

25:05.820 --> 25:08.100
 these surgical procedures still are surgical procedures,

25:08.100 --> 25:10.620
 and patients are hesitant to proceed,

25:10.620 --> 25:12.300
 especially when they know that their chance

25:12.300 --> 25:14.840
 of a transformative effect is quite low.

25:14.840 --> 25:19.840
 We can generally achieve a responder rate of about 50%,

25:21.620 --> 25:24.240
 and responders still have symptomatic OCD.

25:24.240 --> 25:29.240
 So I'm really sort of inspired to really find a way

25:29.780 --> 25:32.900
 to deliver these therapies in a more disease-specific

25:32.900 --> 25:34.700
 or symptom-specific way,

25:34.700 --> 25:37.700
 but we're years away probably from that therapy

25:37.700 --> 25:40.580
 since it's all part of a research study at the moment.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.020
 What brain areas should I think about

25:43.020 --> 25:44.100
 when I think about OCD?

25:44.100 --> 25:46.620
 Years ago, I remember opening a textbook,

25:46.620 --> 25:48.420
 I think I was an undergraduate still,

25:48.420 --> 25:50.380
 and work from Judith Rappaport

25:50.380 --> 25:51.980
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

25:51.980 --> 25:54.080
 this would be late 80s, early 90s,

25:55.900 --> 25:59.140
 had done some neuroimaging, or maybe it was PET,

26:00.260 --> 26:02.000
 or some other imaging technique,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.980
 and had identified portions of the basal ganglia,

26:04.980 --> 26:09.180
 caudate, putatum-type structures in OCD,

26:09.180 --> 26:12.660
 and maybe some differences in boys versus girls.

26:12.660 --> 26:15.100
 So what brain areas are there sex differences

26:15.100 --> 26:20.100
 in terms of OCD, and were one to come into your clinic

26:20.980 --> 26:25.500
 for this sort of a work of ablations or stimulation,

26:25.500 --> 26:28.620
 where would you first start to probe in the brain?

26:28.620 --> 26:33.620
 Yeah, this is a disorder of both cortex

26:33.620 --> 26:35.940
 and the subcortex.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.900
 The cortical control areas,

26:39.900 --> 26:42.340
 areas that are involved in inhibitory control,

26:42.340 --> 26:46.420
 we have found to not function properly in patients with OCD.

26:46.420 --> 26:48.580
 So areas like the overall frontal cortex

26:48.580 --> 26:50.380
 and the prefrontal cortex,

26:50.380 --> 26:51.980
 if you image these areas,

26:51.980 --> 26:55.460
 or study them even in a rodent model of OCD,

26:55.460 --> 26:57.420
 which quite honestly, these models,

26:57.420 --> 27:01.380
 they model aspects of OCD, but OCD is a human condition.

27:01.380 --> 27:04.100
 You can't really model this whole condition

27:04.100 --> 27:05.540
 in a mouse or a rat,

27:05.540 --> 27:09.860
 but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat, sure.

27:09.860 --> 27:10.940
 Pulling out their hair.

27:10.940 --> 27:11.780
 Yeah, exactly.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.540
 You know, that's not necessarily

27:13.540 --> 27:15.140
 obsessive compulsive disorder,

27:15.140 --> 27:16.580
 but that is compulsive behavior,

27:16.580 --> 27:19.100
 and perhaps if you can ameliorate that in a rat,

27:19.100 --> 27:20.900
 that might be helpful for a patient with OCD,

27:20.900 --> 27:25.380
 but we have to approach animal modeling of OCD thoughtfully,

27:25.380 --> 27:27.900
 and most scientists do, I think.

27:27.900 --> 27:32.820
 And when we study OCD in models or in humans with imaging,

27:32.820 --> 27:35.860
 and we're trying to do it invasively with electrodes

27:35.860 --> 27:38.020
 like we do in epilepsy patients,

27:38.020 --> 27:40.100
 we find that areas in the cortex

27:40.100 --> 27:42.140
 like the prefrontal and the prefrontal cortex

27:42.140 --> 27:44.060
 are not functioning the way they would

27:44.060 --> 27:45.380
 in a non-OCD patient.

27:45.380 --> 27:48.420
 They are often hyper-functioning,

27:48.420 --> 27:50.460
 such that while you might say,

27:50.460 --> 27:51.380
 well, they're hyper-functioning,

27:51.380 --> 27:53.580
 so aren't these patients, you know,

27:53.580 --> 27:55.380
 functioning better?

27:55.380 --> 27:56.220
 Hyper-focused.

27:56.220 --> 27:58.260
 Hyper-focused, exactly.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.820
 No, I would say it's not so much an up or a down.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.620
 It's more that they're just dysfunctional,

28:02.620 --> 28:04.180
 and we need to find a way

28:04.180 --> 28:07.020
 to try to restore normal function to these areas.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.180
 It's not so much directional, really.

28:09.180 --> 28:11.980
 We tend to oversimplify brain function

28:11.980 --> 28:15.260
 by thinking about it with directionality too much.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.300
 Unfortunately, imaging studies

28:16.300 --> 28:20.220
 sometimes demonstrate activation or hypoactivation,

28:20.220 --> 28:22.020
 and that's where I think these kinds of things

28:22.020 --> 28:23.380
 can be misconstrued,

28:23.380 --> 28:26.180
 but what I would call the cortical areas of OCD

28:26.180 --> 28:27.860
 is that they're dysregulated,

28:27.860 --> 28:28.700
 and we need to find a way

28:28.700 --> 28:30.580
 to try to normalize their function.

28:30.580 --> 28:32.620
 So the frontal lobe is huge,

28:32.620 --> 28:34.820
 but areas of the frontal lobe that are a bit more basal,

28:34.820 --> 28:36.780
 like the OFC or orbital frontal cortex

28:36.780 --> 28:38.180
 and the prefrontal cortex,

28:38.180 --> 28:40.620
 definitely consistently seem to be implicated

28:40.620 --> 28:42.740
 in patients with OCD,

28:42.740 --> 28:44.740
 and then there are projections to the subcortex.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.900
 This is the basal ganglia, like you were saying,

28:46.900 --> 28:49.100
 caudate putamen or the dorsal striatum,

28:49.100 --> 28:51.020
 and these are interconnected with the ventral striatum.

28:51.020 --> 28:51.860
 This is an area of the brain

28:51.860 --> 28:55.020
 that I focus a lot of my energy in.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.060
 This is the ventral striatum,

28:56.060 --> 28:59.660
 which is not limited to but includes the nucleus accumbens.

28:59.660 --> 29:00.940
 This is an area of the brain

29:00.940 --> 29:03.100
 that we know to be involved

29:03.100 --> 29:05.140
 in gating reward-seeking behavior.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.900
 When it's perturbed, it seems to gait compulsive behavior,

29:07.900 --> 29:10.860
 meaning a rat will pursue a reward despite punishment,

29:10.860 --> 29:12.860
 despite foot shock, for example,

29:12.860 --> 29:15.780
 and that can be similar to an OCD patient.

29:15.780 --> 29:19.420
 They will check their home for safety

29:19.420 --> 29:21.940
 until 3 a.m. in the morning and not sleep that night.

29:21.940 --> 29:26.660
 In a way, that is similar to a rat seeking out a food reward

29:26.660 --> 29:28.380
 despite a foot shock,

29:28.380 --> 29:32.180
 doing something because of the urge but despite the risk,

29:32.180 --> 29:37.180
 and perhaps there is some normal judgment there.

29:38.380 --> 29:42.180
 We all have to take risks to function in everyday society.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.220
 To be successful, we have to take a risk.

29:45.460 --> 29:46.820
 To take care of patients with surgery,

29:46.820 --> 29:48.180
 there's some risk there.

29:48.180 --> 29:52.860
 We make a judgment call, and that's not a condition.

29:52.860 --> 29:55.060
 That's just normal.

29:55.060 --> 30:00.060
 But when our judgment consistently sort of puts us at risk,

30:00.540 --> 30:03.620
 that's where we have something like OCD.

30:03.620 --> 30:06.540
 But OCD is also, you know, it's one of many conditions

30:06.540 --> 30:08.060
 that suffer from these kinds of problems.

30:08.060 --> 30:09.620
 We tend to label them

30:09.620 --> 30:11.860
 because they tend to present in a consistent way.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.260
 So we have patients with OCD

30:13.260 --> 30:18.260
 that have hyper-checking behavior or contamination behavior

30:19.020 --> 30:20.780
 where if they feel contaminated,

30:20.780 --> 30:23.020
 they will wash their hands for hours repeatedly,

30:23.020 --> 30:25.020
 or if they drop their toothbrush on the floor,

30:25.020 --> 30:27.220
 this will lead to a compulsive behavior

30:27.220 --> 30:30.340
 of cleaning a toothbrush or brushing your teeth consistently.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.420
 Very, very common symptoms that we see

30:32.420 --> 30:35.580
 or signs that the patients report to us or that we observe.

30:36.980 --> 30:39.820
 But, you know, patients with eating disorders,

30:39.820 --> 30:42.540
 they tend to, if they have binging disorder,

30:42.540 --> 30:43.580
 they'll overeat.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.500
 If they have bulimia, they might purge,

30:45.500 --> 30:47.460
 despite the risk of these things.

30:47.460 --> 30:50.140
 And so addiction is similar.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.900
 We tend to drug-seek if we're addicted.

30:53.820 --> 30:57.660
 We'll pay off a dealer in order to get our fix,

30:57.660 --> 30:58.780
 despite the risk.

30:58.780 --> 31:01.660
 And that type of urge, despite the risk,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.740
 is something that I've always been really interested in.

31:03.740 --> 31:06.820
 And it's a common denominator to all of these problems.

31:06.820 --> 31:08.180
 And if you think about these problems,

31:08.180 --> 31:10.460
 I mean, these are some of the most common conditions

31:10.460 --> 31:12.140
 in our society today.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.660
 I'd like to take a quick break

31:13.660 --> 31:16.560
 and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.020
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,

31:19.020 --> 31:21.380
 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink

31:21.380 --> 31:24.280
 that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.980
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

31:26.980 --> 31:29.180
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.780
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

31:30.780 --> 31:32.860
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

31:32.860 --> 31:34.860
 once or usually twice a day

31:34.860 --> 31:37.180
 is that it gets me the probiotics that I need

31:37.180 --> 31:38.460
 for gut health.

31:38.460 --> 31:39.540
 Our gut is very important.

31:39.540 --> 31:42.100
 It's populated by gut microbiota

31:42.100 --> 31:43.860
 that communicate with the brain, the immune system,

31:43.860 --> 31:46.260
 and basically all the biological systems of our body

31:46.260 --> 31:49.900
 to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.780
 And those probiotics in Athletic Greens

31:51.780 --> 31:55.580
 are optimal and vital for microbiota health.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.140
 In addition, Athletic Greens contains

31:57.140 --> 31:59.060
 a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals

31:59.060 --> 32:00.940
 that make sure that all of my foundational

32:00.940 --> 32:04.400
 nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.860
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

32:05.860 --> 32:09.240
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

32:09.240 --> 32:11.220
 and they'll give you five free travel packs

32:11.220 --> 32:13.540
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

32:13.540 --> 32:14.820
 while you're on the road, in the car,

32:14.820 --> 32:16.100
 on the plane, et cetera.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.520
 And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.220
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

32:22.220 --> 32:23.580
 to get the five free travel packs

32:23.580 --> 32:26.620
 and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

32:26.620 --> 32:29.320
 Yeah, I really appreciate that you're building this bridge

32:29.320 --> 32:30.940
 from OCD to nucleus accumbens,

32:30.940 --> 32:33.340
 which is, of course, associated with reward

32:33.340 --> 32:35.940
 in various forms, and we'll get to that.

32:35.940 --> 32:40.940
 I'll share a personal anecdote as a form of question.

32:41.380 --> 32:44.600
 When I was in college and studying a lot,

32:44.600 --> 32:47.800
 I relied on caffeine as a stimulant.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.540
 I've never really been into drugs or alcohol.

32:49.540 --> 32:50.740
 I've been lucky in that sense.

32:50.740 --> 32:54.100
 I don't drink and I care less if alcohol disappeared.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.660
 Never really liked recreational drugs,

32:55.660 --> 32:57.780
 so I was never drawn to them.

32:57.780 --> 33:00.580
 However, when I was in college,

33:00.580 --> 33:04.220
 at the time there were these little epinephrine pills

33:04.220 --> 33:07.660
 that were common in a lot of sports supplements.

33:07.660 --> 33:10.120
 These were like pre-workout type things.

33:10.120 --> 33:13.500
 Not unlike energy drinks now, which I completely avoid.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
 And I had this experience of taking one of these

33:15.500 --> 33:16.620
 and drinking some coffee,

33:16.620 --> 33:18.300
 and of course it gave me a lift in energy.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.160
 These are very similar to amphetamine.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.100
 They were legal over the counter at the time.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.380
 They're now either banned or illegal.

33:24.380 --> 33:26.000
 I do not recommend them.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.260
 And I had a lot of energy,

33:27.260 --> 33:30.500
 but what I noticed is that my grunting tick came back

33:30.500 --> 33:33.180
 and I had, I made one mistake.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.780
 I still think of this as one mistake,

33:34.780 --> 33:38.000
 which was I engaged in a superstitious behavior.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.540
 I knocked on wood.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.700
 And then somehow it felt very rewarding.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.340
 Like it gave me some totally irrational,

33:44.340 --> 33:48.020
 but internally rational sense of security around.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.900
 I forget what I was knocking on wood about.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.340
 And I found that I couldn't break

33:51.340 --> 33:52.780
 that knock on wood compulsion.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.680
 I felt I needed to knock on wood.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.540
 And so then I started sneaking knock on woods,

33:56.540 --> 33:58.140
 like in mid-exam and studying.

33:58.140 --> 34:01.780
 And pretty soon I was knocking on wood often.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.780
 I developed a superstition.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.740
 And so I'm curious about the role of superstition

34:05.740 --> 34:07.740
 and compulsion and the crossover there.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.020
 It makes sense logically to me,

34:09.020 --> 34:11.580
 but I was equally shocked to learn

34:11.580 --> 34:14.340
 that when I stopped taking this stimulant,

34:14.340 --> 34:16.900
 which I was quite happy to stop

34:16.900 --> 34:18.180
 because it did make me feel too alert,

34:18.180 --> 34:20.160
 couldn't sleep well, et cetera,

34:20.160 --> 34:22.880
 that the superstition went away as well.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.340
 And I'm guessing this has something to do

34:24.340 --> 34:27.620
 with some of the reward circuitry,

34:27.620 --> 34:30.480
 as it's called, related to stimulants.

34:30.480 --> 34:34.780
 Again, I am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants,

34:34.780 --> 34:37.340
 although healthy use of caffeine or safe use of caffeine

34:37.340 --> 34:40.160
 might be the one universally accepted stimulant.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.320
 It was really surprising to me how quickly this came on,

34:43.320 --> 34:47.960
 how quickly it engaged my thinking and my behavior,

34:47.960 --> 34:49.920
 the obsessions and the compulsions,

34:49.920 --> 34:52.100
 and how quickly it turned off

34:52.100 --> 34:55.120
 when I stopped taking this sports stimulant

34:55.120 --> 34:55.940
 or whatever it was.

34:55.940 --> 34:56.780
 I don't even remember.

34:56.780 --> 34:58.560
 I think it was some form of epinephrine, ephedrine.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.840
 It's not epinephrine, excuse me, I misspoke, ephedrine.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.720
 Does what I described sound totally outside the bounds

35:06.720 --> 35:11.440
 of logic or am I imagining it all?

35:11.440 --> 35:12.440
 It did happen.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.400
 I'm certain it happened.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.520
 Yeah, no, I don't think you're imagining it at all.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.940
 The grunting that you mentioned to me,

35:18.940 --> 35:20.880
 first of all, I didn't comment,

35:20.880 --> 35:23.880
 but that sort of, not to put a label on it,

35:23.880 --> 35:25.280
 but it sounds like a tick.

35:25.280 --> 35:29.680
 And ticks in young males, extremely common,

35:29.680 --> 35:31.120
 and they do tend to go away.

35:31.120 --> 35:31.960
 Blinking ticks like this.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.160
 I have a good friend who,

35:33.160 --> 35:34.700
 he's actually a famous neuroscientist,

35:34.700 --> 35:35.840
 I won't mention who it is,

35:35.840 --> 35:39.040
 who's worked very hard to suppress his blinking ticks.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.120
 And when he gets fatigued, it comes back

35:41.120 --> 35:44.280
 and he's very high functioning in his personal life

35:44.280 --> 35:45.760
 and his professional life.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.680
 But when you're talking to him and he starts doing this,

35:47.680 --> 35:50.760
 so you kind of start wondering what's going on.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.760
 Yeah, and it's unfortunate, people with these problems,

35:53.760 --> 35:55.020
 especially as they get more severe,

35:55.020 --> 35:57.240
 then you get Tourette's syndrome.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.600
 It's hard to function in our society.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.480
 I have some friends that have Tourette's.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.240
 I'll tell you, I'm just so inspired

36:03.240 --> 36:07.680
 because they're so confident.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.580
 And people obviously notice these problems,

36:10.580 --> 36:13.680
 but they just live their life and they're very successful.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.440
 And that's not typical.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.720
 I have friends that I went to Penn with undergrad

36:18.720 --> 36:19.860
 that had these kinds of problems,

36:19.860 --> 36:23.100
 and I was always just so happy and inspired by them.

36:23.100 --> 36:27.600
 But what's more typical is these problems cause people

36:27.600 --> 36:32.600
 to lose their confidence and not pursue their profession

36:34.100 --> 36:38.360
 as they may have done or things of that nature.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.160
 So I think it's all related to the fact

36:41.160 --> 36:43.480
 that our brains are very vulnerable.

36:43.480 --> 36:46.760
 And to get back to your question about the stimulant,

36:46.760 --> 36:50.080
 I think your brain was very vulnerable to it.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.080
 You sort of may have had a predisposition to it.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.680
 You mentioned that you're a little obsessive,

36:55.680 --> 36:58.240
 and with the tick there, maybe you have this kind of,

36:58.240 --> 37:01.940
 you know, on the mild side of the spectrum OCD.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.720
 And I probably do as well, by the way.

37:03.720 --> 37:07.440
 So I also have avoided drugs for that reason in my life.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.120
 I'll drink a little bit of wine here and there,

37:09.120 --> 37:10.560
 but that's about it.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.480
 But I think most people don't avoid these things.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.540
 And we see these problems in relation

37:17.540 --> 37:19.620
 to not just taking a stimulant,

37:19.620 --> 37:21.800
 but any kind of environmental exposure.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.240
 Our own society causes so much stress.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.480
 And that's why I think we have these human conditions.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.200
 These are human conditions.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.160
 We try to model them in animals,

37:31.160 --> 37:34.160
 but most animals don't have these kinds of problems.

37:34.160 --> 37:38.760
 I've heard that an animal like a monkey in the wild

37:38.760 --> 37:41.580
 can have depression, a monkey's version of depression,

37:41.580 --> 37:43.960
 but I don't think it's really typical

37:43.960 --> 37:45.360
 or human depression, you know?

37:45.360 --> 37:47.400
 And certainly it's not as prevalent as depression is

37:47.400 --> 37:48.240
 in our human society.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.400
 I think, you know, we haven't evolved

37:50.400 --> 37:53.080
 to manage the stresses that are in this society

37:53.080 --> 37:54.200
 that we currently have.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.200
 And stimulants is probably one of them, you know?

37:56.200 --> 37:59.160
 And I suspect you were probably a little bit vulnerable.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.900
 It's possible the stimulant led to an overdrive

38:02.900 --> 38:04.900
 of your prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex,

38:04.900 --> 38:07.120
 and even brought out a little OCD behavior

38:07.120 --> 38:09.960
 related to this super, this superstition that you had.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.360
 So, no, I believe that entirely.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.520
 And I also think, you know, that's why things like OCD

38:15.520 --> 38:17.280
 and other kinds of psychiatric disorders

38:17.280 --> 38:19.080
 tend to present themselves in college

38:19.080 --> 38:22.540
 when people leave their home and they're in school

38:22.540 --> 38:25.560
 and they're stressed and they're getting exposed to things

38:25.560 --> 38:27.360
 that they haven't been exposed to before

38:27.360 --> 38:28.780
 outside of the home.

38:28.780 --> 38:31.480
 And, you know, their brains aren't evolved

38:31.480 --> 38:35.680
 and sophisticated enough yet to help them

38:35.680 --> 38:37.160
 cope with these kinds of stresses

38:37.160 --> 38:40.140
 and how it manifests is in these kinds of conditions.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.200
 And I don't want to put a label on those conditions,

38:42.200 --> 38:43.740
 but certainly it could be a psychiatric disorder,

38:43.740 --> 38:45.920
 but it could also just be lots of anxiety.

38:45.920 --> 38:49.320
 It could also be the kind of problems that you had as well.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.900
 So, and I think the nucleus accumbens

38:51.900 --> 38:54.220
 and the cortical areas that we've been discussing

38:54.220 --> 38:56.900
 that sort of send projections to these areas

38:56.900 --> 39:00.640
 are probably at least one of the main circuits

39:00.640 --> 39:02.280
 involved in these kinds of things.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.040
 Well, I'm relieved it's no longer present,

39:05.040 --> 39:08.400
 but I confess it, I always feel it close by.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.960
 A long run helps.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.200
 So, you know, being a slightly fatigued,

39:12.200 --> 39:14.120
 not overly fatigued, but slightly fatigued

39:14.120 --> 39:16.400
 seems to move out the kind of physical compulsion,

39:16.400 --> 39:18.360
 but tried to channel it,

39:18.360 --> 39:19.960
 never taken any medication for it,

39:19.960 --> 39:22.200
 and here I am, so I'm still going.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.520
 I may call you for a referral at some point,

39:24.520 --> 39:27.220
 but at this point I'm feeling okay.

39:28.340 --> 39:31.640
 Let's talk about nucleus accumbens and reward circuitry

39:31.640 --> 39:36.640
 and the relationship between OCD, reward, addiction,

39:36.880 --> 39:39.520
 and to just give you a sense of where I'm headed with this

39:39.520 --> 39:42.220
 is into the realm of food-related

39:42.220 --> 39:45.640
 and eating-related behaviors and disorders,

39:45.640 --> 39:49.360
 because I know you're doing some very important work there.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.940
 What is nucleus accumbens?

39:50.940 --> 39:55.320
 I know we all have one or two, one on each side of the brain.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.200
 What is it, what roles does it play

39:58.200 --> 40:01.720
 in healthy brain behavior and in pathology?

40:01.720 --> 40:05.800
 Yeah, the nucleus accumbens is a part of the brain,

40:05.800 --> 40:07.760
 part of our reward circuits,

40:07.760 --> 40:09.220
 the hub of the reward circuits

40:09.220 --> 40:12.080
 that I've always been most fascinated in.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.460
 There are scientists around the world,

40:15.460 --> 40:16.760
 some of the leading,

40:16.760 --> 40:19.160
 arguably some of the leading scientists in the world,

40:19.160 --> 40:21.960
 the father of addiction neuroscience, I call him,

40:21.960 --> 40:23.540
 although he tells me I'm nuts,

40:23.540 --> 40:25.800
 Rob Malenka, who has studied the nucleus accumbens

40:25.800 --> 40:27.580
 since the beginning of his career

40:27.580 --> 40:30.440
 and who I worked with when I was at Stanford.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.080
 Fabulous scientist and mentor,

40:32.080 --> 40:34.860
 taught me so much, taught the world so much.

40:34.860 --> 40:38.560
 Incredible person, scientist, and physician as well.

40:38.560 --> 40:42.360
 Yes, MD, PhD, and brilliant in both ways,

40:42.360 --> 40:45.960
 and very fatherly in a lot of way

40:45.960 --> 40:48.520
 in terms of teaching people how to do science

40:48.520 --> 40:50.680
 and be good citizens as well.

40:52.240 --> 40:56.960
 But the nucleus accumbens is an area

40:56.960 --> 40:58.560
 that is also very complicated

40:58.560 --> 41:01.300
 because it has a lot of functions.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.360
 It interconnects with many parts of the brain.

41:05.360 --> 41:09.160
 But there are some things about the nucleus accumbens

41:09.160 --> 41:10.480
 that are very consistent.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.840
 So when I started getting interested in reward

41:15.840 --> 41:18.160
 and what I could do as a surgeon

41:18.160 --> 41:22.960
 to try to improve how we manage rewards,

41:22.960 --> 41:24.280
 and what I mean by that specifically

41:24.280 --> 41:28.040
 is if you have an urge for a reward,

41:28.040 --> 41:29.960
 that's a normal phenomenon.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.940
 That's not something we're trying to stop.

41:31.940 --> 41:34.760
 The issue is if you have an urge for a reward

41:34.760 --> 41:37.040
 that either puts you or somebody else at risk,

41:37.040 --> 41:39.420
 it's probably a reward we shouldn't have.

41:39.420 --> 41:40.260
 I suppose you could say,

41:40.260 --> 41:41.600
 well, it depends on the size of the reward

41:41.600 --> 41:42.580
 and the size of the risk

41:42.580 --> 41:44.980
 and how that fits into your societal norms.

41:46.160 --> 41:49.240
 But for example, if you're obese

41:49.240 --> 41:53.880
 and you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight

41:53.880 --> 41:56.020
 and try to control your eating habits,

41:57.180 --> 42:00.760
 perhaps better food choices is an important way

42:00.760 --> 42:01.760
 for you to be healthier,

42:01.760 --> 42:04.160
 and not pursuing those better food choices,

42:04.160 --> 42:06.940
 that's an urge that we probably need to treat.

42:08.040 --> 42:13.040
 If you're a drug addict and you use heroin or opiate,

42:13.620 --> 42:16.240
 considering the opiate crisis right now,

42:16.240 --> 42:21.240
 or cocaine, which is untreatable at the moment,

42:22.680 --> 42:26.320
 you know, that cocaine might make you feel

42:26.320 --> 42:28.200
 like you have some more energy that day

42:28.200 --> 42:29.560
 to deal with your work,

42:29.560 --> 42:31.200
 or that opiate might make you feel better

42:31.200 --> 42:32.540
 because life is stressful.

42:32.540 --> 42:35.760
 But the risk of doing those things is really high,

42:35.760 --> 42:37.480
 in fact, potentially lethal.

42:38.540 --> 42:41.640
 So that's an urge that's treatable.

42:41.640 --> 42:46.640
 If you have OCD and you can't sleep at night

42:46.640 --> 42:48.760
 because you're so nervous that you didn't lock the door

42:48.760 --> 42:51.260
 and you've checked 30 times,

42:51.260 --> 42:54.800
 that's a reality for some people with severe OCD.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.040
 That's an urge we got to treat.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.360
 Eating disorder is the same.

42:58.360 --> 43:01.880
 Eating disorders and obesity are obviously linked

43:01.880 --> 43:04.760
 because of the relationship of a patient with food,

43:04.760 --> 43:06.320
 but they're also quite distinct.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.760
 Not everybody with obesity has an eating disorder,

43:08.760 --> 43:09.800
 and obviously not everybody

43:09.800 --> 43:12.480
 with an eating disorder has obesity.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.440
 I'm particularly interested in patients

43:14.440 --> 43:17.160
 that have binge eating disorder as well as obesity

43:17.160 --> 43:18.860
 because they're so heavily linked.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.280
 Not everybody with binge eating disorder has obesity,

43:22.280 --> 43:24.360
 but on average, most are overweight.

43:25.560 --> 43:28.320
 We are doing a deep brain stimulation trial at Penn

43:28.320 --> 43:31.200
 where we're trying to modulate the nucleus accumbens

43:31.200 --> 43:32.740
 and understand it better in patients

43:32.740 --> 43:34.480
 that have failed gastric bypass surgery,

43:34.480 --> 43:38.840
 the most aggressive form of treatment for obesity.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.760
 And we believe they failed gastric bypass surgery

43:41.760 --> 43:43.560
 because of binge eating disorder,

43:43.560 --> 43:45.600
 meaning they just can't control how much they eat.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.600
 So their obesity is either related or even due to overeating,

43:49.600 --> 43:54.600
 not some predisposition to that body habitus.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.240
 Obesity is a phenotype, something that we can see.

43:57.240 --> 43:59.160
 Not everybody is obese because of the same thing.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.120
 So it's very important.

44:00.120 --> 44:03.400
 I was taught this by a close mentor and friend, Tom Wadden,

44:03.400 --> 44:07.360
 when he was the director of the obesity center at Penn

44:07.360 --> 44:09.880
 or the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders.

44:09.880 --> 44:12.560
 And he said to me, you know, Casey,

44:12.560 --> 44:14.160
 be careful with obesity.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.700
 You're interested in addiction,

44:15.700 --> 44:17.240
 and I understand you're interested

44:17.240 --> 44:20.480
 in the addictive tendencies of certain patients with obesity

44:23.120 --> 44:24.720
 and their relationship with food,

44:24.720 --> 44:26.840
 but not everybody with obesity has that problem.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.800
 And in fact, it's probably present

44:28.800 --> 44:30.860
 in about 20% of patients with obesity.

44:31.880 --> 44:32.800
 But now taking a step back,

44:32.800 --> 44:35.520
 20% of patients with obesity is still a massive problem

44:35.520 --> 44:37.160
 of epidemic proportions.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.200
 And perhaps some of these patients

44:39.200 --> 44:41.760
 have either some form of binge eating disorder

44:41.760 --> 44:44.560
 or I should say some degree of binge eating disorder,

44:44.560 --> 44:47.900
 or at least loss of control eating, which is common to both.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.680
 So that's a feature that I think eating disorder experts,

44:52.680 --> 44:55.060
 obesity experts, neurosurgeons,

44:55.060 --> 45:00.060
 obesity medicine experts would agree

45:00.140 --> 45:03.020
 is common to eating disorders and obesity.

45:03.020 --> 45:05.460
 And I also believe is common to addicts

45:05.460 --> 45:07.260
 and perhaps patients with OCD

45:07.260 --> 45:10.320
 is sort of a loss of control disorder.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.460
 It's actually not a disorder known by like the DSM-5,

45:14.460 --> 45:16.100
 some diagnostic manual,

45:16.100 --> 45:17.860
 but a feature, I should say,

45:17.860 --> 45:19.580
 of these conditions that's common.

45:19.580 --> 45:24.580
 And that common denominator I believe can be restored

45:24.580 --> 45:26.760
 or at least this problem can be ameliorated

45:26.760 --> 45:29.920
 or improved upon by a better understanding

45:29.920 --> 45:32.220
 and a tailored treatment

45:32.220 --> 45:34.120
 to the nucleus accumbens specifically.

45:35.120 --> 45:38.460
 We have learned in mice that if you expose a mouse,

45:38.460 --> 45:39.880
 now this is just a model,

45:39.880 --> 45:42.700
 if you expose a mouse to high fat food,

45:42.700 --> 45:44.240
 not food that they would normally eat,

45:44.240 --> 45:48.440
 food that is like 60% fat, high fat, it's like butter.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.440
 We've learned that if you expose them to food like that,

45:52.440 --> 45:55.780
 within two weeks, their nucleus accumbens is not functioning

45:55.780 --> 45:58.520
 like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food.

45:58.520 --> 46:01.840
 There's aspects of it that are hyperactive, I could say,

46:01.840 --> 46:03.880
 and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive

46:03.880 --> 46:05.800
 or decreased activity.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.320
 But either way, it's not functioning properly.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.000
 And most likely that function

46:10.000 --> 46:12.880
 is predisposing continued behavior.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.000
 And then probably eventually leads to things like a habit

46:16.000 --> 46:16.840
 that gets developed.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.400
 And that's a whole nother area of these kinds of problems

46:19.400 --> 46:22.580
 that is very complicated and poorly understood.

46:22.580 --> 46:26.940
 But in any case, if we just focus on the behavior at hand,

46:26.940 --> 46:28.960
 it seems that repeated exposure

46:28.960 --> 46:32.480
 to something like high fat food, a drug of abuse,

46:32.480 --> 46:37.480
 or any type of reward that is a really strong reward,

46:37.960 --> 46:40.680
 in a way it can hijack normal functioning

46:40.680 --> 46:41.600
 of the nucleus accumbens.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.640
 So the goal of our invasive trial

46:44.640 --> 46:46.680
 is to try to restore normal functioning

46:46.680 --> 46:48.880
 to that nucleus accumbens.

46:48.880 --> 46:51.120
 In mice, there seems to be a signal

46:51.120 --> 46:54.400
 that predicts when they're going to lose control.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.960
 And we can use that signal

46:55.960 --> 46:58.840
 to deliver a sort of a real-time therapy

46:58.840 --> 47:00.240
 in the form of deep brain stimulation,

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
 just a brief amount of stimulation.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.460
 And that actually blocks the behavior.

47:04.460 --> 47:05.580
 And what's interesting is over time,

47:05.580 --> 47:08.740
 that signal actually decreases in frequency,

47:08.740 --> 47:12.540
 which suggests some level of restoring normal function

47:12.540 --> 47:13.640
 to that circuit in a mouse.

47:13.640 --> 47:16.540
 And we're trying to do that now in a human trial.

47:16.540 --> 47:19.320
 Fascinating, where is the stimulation provided?

47:19.320 --> 47:21.040
 Because I would imagine that if one were

47:21.040 --> 47:22.560
 to stimulate nucleus accumbens,

47:22.560 --> 47:26.800
 you would see a reinforcement

47:26.800 --> 47:30.420
 of whatever behavior coincided or preceded the stimulation.

47:30.420 --> 47:35.160
 So the stimulation, it's a brief delivery of stimulation,

47:35.160 --> 47:37.320
 anywhere between five and 10 seconds,

47:37.320 --> 47:42.320
 that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling

47:42.480 --> 47:45.140
 that's happening in the nucleus accumbens.

47:45.140 --> 47:49.080
 There are disorders like depression, let's say,

47:49.080 --> 47:52.400
 that I would describe as a bit more of a state disorder.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.720
 And this is obviously oversimplified

47:54.720 --> 47:56.580
 because we know that there's fluctuations

47:56.580 --> 47:57.800
 in mood and depression as well.

47:57.800 --> 48:01.320
 So don't let me oversimplify it too much.

48:01.320 --> 48:05.160
 But for now, let's forgive the oversimplification.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.660
 If we accept that depression is a state disorder,

48:07.660 --> 48:10.200
 or maybe Parkinson's disease is a state disorder,

48:10.200 --> 48:11.960
 recognizing that they do fluctuate,

48:11.960 --> 48:16.960
 these types of problems most likely, but not definitely,

48:17.100 --> 48:20.260
 most likely need a continuous therapy of some form,

48:20.260 --> 48:22.500
 a therapy that's consistent,

48:22.500 --> 48:24.820
 perhaps a therapy that fluctuates with the condition,

48:24.820 --> 48:26.500
 but nevertheless still consistent.

48:29.420 --> 48:34.020
 Binge eating disorder or OCD or addiction

48:35.260 --> 48:37.960
 and binge eating disorder in the context of obesity,

48:37.960 --> 48:39.340
 a lot of these patients are functioning

48:39.340 --> 48:40.700
 quite normally every single day.

48:40.700 --> 48:43.000
 It's just that intermittently throughout the day,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.820
 there's brief interruptions in their normal function

48:45.820 --> 48:47.500
 such that they have thoughts about food

48:47.500 --> 48:50.980
 or the drug of abuse that they're really longing to have.

48:50.980 --> 48:54.620
 And so we wanna deliver a episodic therapy

48:54.620 --> 48:59.260
 delivered at the right time and only at the right time

48:59.260 --> 49:04.260
 to try to interrupt the circuit aberration

49:04.860 --> 49:06.940
 or the problem at hand

49:06.940 --> 49:09.060
 that is gonna lead to that dangerous behavior

49:09.060 --> 49:10.860
 and to kind of get the patient back on track

49:10.860 --> 49:11.940
 to what they're doing.

49:13.660 --> 49:18.580
 I don't necessarily think that it leads to a reinforcement.

49:18.580 --> 49:21.540
 It's possible, we have to study that more,

49:21.540 --> 49:24.900
 but rather the goal is to just disrupt

49:24.900 --> 49:27.100
 perhaps what is kind of habitual

49:28.420 --> 49:33.140
 or at least this kind of recurring problem that is happening.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.860
 People that have binge eating disorder,

49:34.860 --> 49:35.940
 at least at a severe level,

49:35.940 --> 49:38.020
 they tend to binge about once a day,

49:38.020 --> 49:39.740
 but they don't binge all day long, of course.

49:39.740 --> 49:42.480
 They have a moment perhaps when they get home from work

49:42.480 --> 49:43.780
 and they're stressed

49:43.780 --> 49:48.300
 where they might have a bout of binge.

49:48.300 --> 49:49.820
 What constitutes a binge?

49:49.820 --> 49:52.120
 And I also want to know,

49:52.120 --> 49:55.140
 does binge eating disorder come on suddenly,

49:55.140 --> 49:57.840
 meaning as an entire disorder?

49:57.840 --> 49:59.600
 One day people wake up,

49:59.600 --> 50:00.940
 suddenly they have binge eating disorder,

50:00.940 --> 50:03.620
 or is this a few too many buffets?

50:03.620 --> 50:07.900
 And I'm being entirely serious here, unlimited food.

50:07.900 --> 50:10.140
 And a circuit gets flipped

50:10.140 --> 50:13.900
 or it kind of starts moving into the high RPMs, so to speak.

50:14.780 --> 50:15.740
 So how does it come on?

50:15.740 --> 50:20.340
 And I'm actually surprised to hear that it's once a day.

50:20.340 --> 50:22.500
 I would think just hearing binge eating disorder,

50:22.500 --> 50:23.740
 I assumed it's like OCD,

50:23.740 --> 50:26.460
 which it probably fluctuates across the day as well.

50:26.460 --> 50:29.140
 But I would have thought anytime people around food,

50:29.140 --> 50:31.060
 they just simply can't control their intake of food.

50:31.060 --> 50:31.880
 Yes.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.100
 So what does this look like

50:33.100 --> 50:35.400
 in terms of the onset of the disorder?

50:35.400 --> 50:38.020
 And then what do you think underlies this once a day

50:38.020 --> 50:39.020
 type of phenomenon?

50:39.020 --> 50:40.180
 That's pretty interesting.

50:40.180 --> 50:43.460
 Yeah, so severe binge eating disorder,

50:43.460 --> 50:45.580
 these patients will binge about once a day.

50:45.580 --> 50:46.620
 It could be a couple of times a day,

50:46.620 --> 50:48.340
 but in general, it's not more than that.

50:48.340 --> 50:51.140
 Moderate is about three to four times a week, for example.

50:52.100 --> 50:56.340
 The reason I think that that seems surprising to you,

50:56.340 --> 50:59.940
 and if you think about it, it is surprising,

51:01.420 --> 51:02.260
 and I agree with you,

51:02.260 --> 51:04.320
 but the reason for that is actually just

51:04.320 --> 51:06.460
 in the definitions of the word.

51:06.460 --> 51:09.940
 And as a neurosurgeon, in full disclosure, as I mentioned,

51:09.940 --> 51:12.060
 I don't see these patients clinically.

51:12.060 --> 51:14.540
 I see them for research trial purposes,

51:14.540 --> 51:17.100
 and I try to understand the literature

51:17.100 --> 51:18.220
 around eating disorders.

51:18.220 --> 51:19.620
 And I obviously collaborate

51:19.620 --> 51:23.140
 with fabulous eating disorders in these problems

51:23.140 --> 51:25.100
 that are highly innovative people.

51:26.640 --> 51:29.220
 But the word binge is a definition.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.780
 There's a definition to that word,

51:30.780 --> 51:34.660
 and you can't necessarily binge all day

51:34.660 --> 51:36.660
 because our stomachs are not big enough.

51:37.700 --> 51:40.900
 And so there's a limit to how much one can eat.

51:40.900 --> 51:42.420
 And to meet criteria for a binge,

51:42.420 --> 51:45.600
 you have to have a sense of loss of control.

51:45.600 --> 51:47.740
 You have to eat an enormous amount of food

51:47.740 --> 51:49.920
 in a brief period of time.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.140
 And yes, generally, that doesn't happen

51:52.140 --> 51:53.780
 more than about once a day

51:53.780 --> 51:56.120
 in a patient with severe binge eating disorder.

51:57.180 --> 52:00.460
 However, they can lose control quite often.

52:00.460 --> 52:02.640
 And in fact, perhaps even at every meal,

52:02.640 --> 52:05.600
 they might meet criteria for a bout of loss of control

52:05.600 --> 52:07.280
 where they, yes, they may have lost control,

52:07.280 --> 52:09.360
 but they might not have eaten enough

52:09.360 --> 52:13.180
 to constitute what we would define as a binge.

52:13.180 --> 52:14.820
 And that would be,

52:14.820 --> 52:17.180
 there's no specific number to that, by the way.

52:17.180 --> 52:20.320
 It's really just compared to their normal meal,

52:20.320 --> 52:23.340
 perhaps it's 50% of their daily calories

52:23.340 --> 52:25.340
 in that one brief moment.

52:26.180 --> 52:29.340
 So that's why I think it seems surprising

52:29.340 --> 52:32.400
 that binges aren't happening more often than that.

52:32.400 --> 52:35.500
 What I would say is if we replace the term binge

52:35.500 --> 52:37.100
 with loss of control eating,

52:37.100 --> 52:40.740
 loss of control eating could happen dozens of times a week.

52:40.740 --> 52:43.260
 And in fact, the patients that we're studying,

52:43.260 --> 52:47.300
 we've seen patients that lose control 20, 30 times a week.

52:47.300 --> 52:49.460
 And that's probably the term you have in mind

52:49.460 --> 52:51.940
 when you're surprised that it's just one time a day.

52:51.940 --> 52:53.380
 And it's specifically related to the fact

52:53.380 --> 52:56.100
 that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food

52:56.100 --> 52:58.540
 in such a brief period of time.

52:58.540 --> 53:00.220
 So it's hard to do that more than once a day.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.060
 I see.

53:01.940 --> 53:05.660
 You mentioned that some pre-existing anxiety

53:05.660 --> 53:08.880
 might bias somebody to have a binge.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.840
 I'm also fascinated by something I've observed before,

53:11.840 --> 53:12.900
 which was when I was in college,

53:12.900 --> 53:17.100
 my girlfriend had a roommate who we were aware was bulimic

53:18.100 --> 53:20.520
 and would binge and then purge.

53:20.520 --> 53:24.220
 And often when she ingested alcohol,

53:24.220 --> 53:25.500
 that would lead to a binge.

53:25.500 --> 53:26.340
 Sure.

53:26.340 --> 53:28.500
 Which is kind of the opposite of anxiety

53:28.500 --> 53:30.020
 when I think about alcohol as something

53:30.020 --> 53:32.980
 that slightly reduces prefrontal activity,

53:32.980 --> 53:34.100
 somewhat of a sedative

53:34.100 --> 53:36.660
 or certainly a sedative at higher dosages.

53:36.660 --> 53:39.860
 So this brings you to something that you said,

53:39.860 --> 53:42.900
 I'm just going to, I won't say it as eloquently as you did,

53:42.900 --> 53:45.580
 that it seems like it's neither the case

53:45.580 --> 53:48.040
 that anxiety leads to binging

53:48.040 --> 53:51.820
 nor that hypo reduced activation of the forebrain

53:51.820 --> 53:54.100
 and lower anxiety leads to binging.

53:54.100 --> 53:56.500
 It's this dysregulation of circuitry

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
 that the seesaw could go either way

53:58.500 --> 54:00.140
 and it can throw things off,

54:00.140 --> 54:02.140
 it's off balance in both cases.

54:04.020 --> 54:08.260
 And that seems to be, that seems to pose a problem.

54:08.260 --> 54:11.060
 It seems like it's a particularly tricky problem

54:11.060 --> 54:15.180
 and kind of explains to me in my nonclinical awareness

54:15.180 --> 54:18.180
 why medication might be really hard to use

54:18.180 --> 54:19.020
 as a way to treat this,

54:19.020 --> 54:20.980
 but that being able to poke around in the brain

54:20.980 --> 54:23.620
 and assay in real time, how do you feel?

54:23.620 --> 54:24.620
 Do you feel like binging now

54:24.620 --> 54:28.500
 or do you feel further from the binge impulse?

54:29.420 --> 54:30.860
 Is that what you do with these patients?

54:30.860 --> 54:32.900
 Are they awake while you're stimulating the brain?

54:32.900 --> 54:33.780
 Because it's one thing to say,

54:33.780 --> 54:36.400
 I stimulate a brain area and the binging goes away

54:36.400 --> 54:38.820
 or partial relief or complete relief,

54:38.820 --> 54:39.860
 but how do you know?

54:39.860 --> 54:44.100
 Are they in there with a donut and you're tempting them?

54:44.100 --> 54:47.300
 So how do you actually know if a blading of brain area

54:47.300 --> 54:50.780
 is going to lead to a relief or exacerbation

54:50.780 --> 54:54.260
 or no impact on this disorder?

54:54.260 --> 54:57.840
 Yeah, so there's a lot to unpack there.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.460
 I'll try to go one step at a time.

54:59.460 --> 55:00.820
 And if I miss something, please remind me.

55:00.820 --> 55:02.780
 And I tend to ask these three-part questions

55:02.780 --> 55:04.100
 specifically of neurosurgeons

55:04.100 --> 55:06.140
 because I like to challenge you guys.

55:06.140 --> 55:08.220
 Because again, you are the astronauts of neuroscience.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.500
 Also, I'm just going to take a moment to poke at neurosurgeons

55:10.500 --> 55:13.660
 because I have a couple close friends who are neurosurgeons

55:13.660 --> 55:14.940
 and I consider Casey a friend.

55:14.940 --> 55:16.080
 I don't know if he considers me a friend,

55:16.080 --> 55:17.520
 but I consider him a friend.

55:17.520 --> 55:19.400
 I'm teasing there too, which is first of all,

55:19.400 --> 55:21.700
 they all have incredible hands, right?

55:21.700 --> 55:24.260
 They have, I'm not, they all guard their hands

55:24.260 --> 55:28.940
 with the kind of protection that you would guard,

55:28.940 --> 55:31.660
 the tools of, the most important tools of your trade.

55:31.660 --> 55:33.040
 So they're very careful with their hands.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.500
 You're not going to see them doing heavy deadlifts.

55:35.500 --> 55:39.060
 You're not because of the way that impacts the motor neurons.

55:39.060 --> 55:40.940
 It's all about fine control.

55:40.940 --> 55:42.840
 So if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts,

55:42.840 --> 55:45.740
 you might want to consider getting a different neurosurgeon.

55:45.740 --> 55:47.180
 Hope I didn't put anyone out of work there.

55:47.180 --> 55:52.180
 And then the other thing is that you all are,

55:52.220 --> 55:55.100
 tend to be very calm people, at least on the exterior.

55:55.100 --> 55:57.300
 We'll return to this later,

55:57.300 --> 55:59.500
 but I do throw three or four questions out at once.

55:59.500 --> 56:03.340
 So elevated autonomic arousal and alertness,

56:03.340 --> 56:05.700
 as well as decreased autonomic arousal and alertness,

56:05.700 --> 56:07.500
 both seem to be able to lead to binging.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.980
 And then there's this question of how do you know

56:09.980 --> 56:12.900
 whether or not to stimulate or to ablate

56:12.900 --> 56:14.700
 or whether or not to leave a structure alone?

56:14.700 --> 56:16.140
 In other words, what does one of these experiments

56:16.140 --> 56:17.260
 look like in the laboratory?

56:17.260 --> 56:18.480
 Yeah, sort of a-

56:18.480 --> 56:19.380
 Clinic, excuse me.

56:19.380 --> 56:20.220
 Yeah, of course.

56:20.220 --> 56:23.340
 Yeah, these are questions I think about all the time.

56:24.540 --> 56:29.140
 And I do want to come back to the deadlifting comment.

56:29.140 --> 56:34.140
 But regarding, and you referred to this earlier as well,

56:35.500 --> 56:38.100
 and I don't know if I addressed it sufficiently either,

56:38.100 --> 56:40.020
 is sort of like what comes first here

56:40.020 --> 56:41.380
 or how does this develop?

56:41.380 --> 56:46.380
 I think, first of all, I like to understand

56:47.400 --> 56:50.800
 these kinds of problems in sort of the construct

56:50.800 --> 56:54.700
 of what I consider to be a bit of a two-hit hypothesis.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.620
 So you sort of need, like in the concussion literature,

56:57.620 --> 56:59.840
 you need, the second hit can be devastating.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.320
 So if you have a concussion, you know,

57:01.320 --> 57:04.560
 you want to only return to play when your symptoms are gone

57:04.560 --> 57:06.200
 and cleared by a physician.

57:07.800 --> 57:10.600
 So in the context of eating disorders,

57:10.600 --> 57:11.880
 or let's say binge eating disorder,

57:11.880 --> 57:13.520
 and first of all, I didn't mention earlier,

57:13.520 --> 57:15.280
 but this is the most common eating disorder,

57:15.280 --> 57:18.000
 affects anywhere between three and 5% of the population.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.400
 Wow.

57:19.400 --> 57:23.200
 And is probably under-diagnosed in obesity, by the way.

57:23.200 --> 57:25.900
 And if obesity affects 35% of our population,

57:25.900 --> 57:27.160
 most likely binge eating disorder

57:27.160 --> 57:28.880
 affects more than three to 5%.

57:28.880 --> 57:32.560
 But that's the current literature estimate

57:32.560 --> 57:33.760
 on the prevalence.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.120
 So how do we develop binge eating disorder

57:37.120 --> 57:41.240
 and is it related to this anxiety question?

57:41.240 --> 57:43.280
 You know, I think that there is a predisposition,

57:43.280 --> 57:44.320
 that's the first hit.

57:46.200 --> 57:48.080
 I actually think all humans have this predisposition,

57:48.080 --> 57:50.000
 just some have it more than others.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.600
 I don't think that we've evolved to live in a society

57:52.600 --> 57:55.440
 where foods are so readily available

57:55.440 --> 57:57.120
 and enormously delicious,

57:57.120 --> 57:59.320
 and have so much sugar and fat in them.

57:59.320 --> 58:01.200
 Not that there's any particular problem

58:01.200 --> 58:03.120
 with either of these macronutrients,

58:03.120 --> 58:07.000
 it's just the excess of it and how they're refined

58:07.000 --> 58:08.400
 that I think is the problem.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.480
 You know, there's high fructose corn syrup

58:11.480 --> 58:13.840
 in almost everything we eat, it's in bread.

58:13.840 --> 58:15.480
 I don't even know why it's in bread sometimes.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.040
 It's just kind of crazy.

58:17.040 --> 58:21.280
 So I don't think we're evolved to live in a society

58:23.280 --> 58:25.880
 that has food that's so readily available like that,

58:25.880 --> 58:27.440
 and cheap, by the way.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.160
 In fact, the cheaper the foods are,

58:29.160 --> 58:32.480
 sort of the more refined and palatable,

58:32.480 --> 58:34.400
 and I would argue, dangerous to eat.

58:34.400 --> 58:37.080
 I think they change our reward circuits for the worse,

58:38.080 --> 58:39.920
 and put us at risk for wanting more.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.440
 I tend to get a headache when I eat food like that,

58:43.440 --> 58:46.800
 and perhaps that's an evolutionary advantage

58:46.800 --> 58:48.400
 because I don't want to eat those foods

58:48.400 --> 58:50.200
 because they actually do make me sick.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.600
 So in a lot of ways, I kind of wish

58:53.600 --> 58:54.600
 that headache on everybody

58:54.600 --> 58:57.240
 because perhaps we wouldn't have all these problems,

58:57.240 --> 58:59.200
 or at least some of them would go away.

58:59.200 --> 59:00.800
 So I think that's the first issue,

59:00.800 --> 59:05.800
 is a predisposition to, or a vulnerability

59:05.840 --> 59:07.800
 to these types of foods,

59:09.320 --> 59:12.000
 which we undoubtedly all have to a certain extent,

59:12.000 --> 59:13.160
 but some more than others.

59:13.160 --> 59:16.280
 And then, so that's the first hit,

59:16.280 --> 59:18.360
 is this predisposition in the context

59:18.360 --> 59:21.560
 of this sort of food-focused society.

59:21.560 --> 59:26.560
 And then the second hit is probably a stressful event,

59:26.760 --> 59:28.160
 or a stressful life,

59:28.160 --> 59:30.640
 and probably a recurring stressful event.

59:30.640 --> 59:32.280
 I'm not sure this is published.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.200
 I've never sat down with like a eating disorder expert

59:35.200 --> 59:37.520
 and had this question about how this develops,

59:37.520 --> 59:39.800
 and I'm not sure it's actually well-known.

59:41.440 --> 59:42.280
 But in a lot of ways,

59:42.280 --> 59:45.760
 I think that that answer anybody would agree with,

59:45.760 --> 59:48.080
 that we need sort of a predisposition in the exposure,

59:48.080 --> 59:50.960
 the environmental exposure and the genetic predisposition,

59:52.880 --> 59:54.880
 but also a stressor.

59:54.880 --> 59:57.200
 And that stressor is probably one that's recurring,

59:57.200 --> 59:59.600
 and it's obvious in our society,

59:59.600 --> 1:00:00.840
 these stressors are everywhere,

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.840
 and how we can manage them is often poor.

1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:06.480
 And I think we can all relate with that.

1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:08.240
 And then there's something else in the background

1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:09.880
 that I think is really important to mention,

1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:13.280
 is that patients with these kinds of problems are embarrassed

1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:16.960
 because our society doesn't think fondly

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:18.680
 of these kinds of patients.

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:21.560
 Binging disorder patients, they do tend to be overweight.

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:23.840
 That's obviously a stigma.

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:26.480
 Obesity is another stigma.

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:29.240
 Then there's the opposite, in a way it's an opposite,

1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:32.000
 by the way, from a phenotype standpoint, that's anorexia.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.400
 I mean, that's another stigma.

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:39.400
 And gosh, not to make this about one sex over another,

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:45.200
 but when girls are told they're pretty because they're thin,

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:47.320
 it just reinforces this problem.

1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:49.760
 And of course you want to compliment people

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.640
 and make them feel good about themselves,

1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:55.200
 but the problem is that in this vulnerable society,

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:56.600
 that that can lead to problems

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:57.840
 because people start thinking,

1:00:57.840 --> 1:00:59.600
 oh, I should be thin or thinner.

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:05.840
 So I think that it's a little bit of a societal understanding

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:08.400
 that our brains are very vulnerable.

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:10.880
 And I think that will really help changing society.

1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:11.720
 It's hard.

1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:15.480
 And most of society is not ill-meaning.

1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:17.640
 It's all done by accident,

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:19.400
 but that is the society that we live in.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:23.320
 So if we can try to improve that stigma

1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:27.160
 and be kinder to people in that way,

1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:28.680
 I think a lot of these problems would get better.

1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:30.440
 People that are obese,

1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:33.800
 that feel embarrassed by their obesity, it doesn't help.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:36.360
 It only makes it worse because they give up.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.360
 Same thing might be true for anorexics.

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:41.360
 So I really think it's important

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:42.760
 to consider all of these things.

1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:44.280
 And that's why it's so complicated.

1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:46.960
 And it would be so hard to do a well-controlled study

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:47.800
 to understand it better

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:50.320
 because there's so many of these variables to control for

1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:52.240
 that you really can't control for.

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:53.400
 You might be able to control for them

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:54.960
 in a mouse's home cage,

1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:57.200
 but not in the society that we live in.

1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:02.200
 So that's kind of my brief sort of summary

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:04.800
 of how I would answer your first question.

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:07.400
 Then I think your second question,

1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:08.560
 I sort of take that as,

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:12.760
 well, how do you study such a complicated problem

1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.920
 in the operating room and in the clinic?

1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:17.080
 Because I mentioned the operating room

1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:19.720
 because that's sort of the first step here.

1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:22.400
 First, we have, just to clarify,

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:27.400
 we have a NIH-funded trial approved by the FDA for research

1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:30.200
 to do this first in human study.

1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:32.880
 We've treated two patients.

1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:34.720
 We have four more to come at Penn.

1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:38.280
 And in this study,

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:40.960
 it's something I've been working towards my entire career.

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:46.960
 What we don't know is where in the nucleus accumbens

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:49.280
 in the nucleus accumbens.

1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:54.280
 Will we identify cells or regions

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:59.200
 that seem to be involved

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:02.400
 in this sort of reward-seeking behavior?

1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:04.280
 I would call it appetitive.

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:06.280
 It's kind of like appetite,

1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:09.520
 but the word appetitive is I think a good word to use.

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:11.680
 What part of the nucleus accumbens is appetitive?

1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:12.960
 Is the whole thing appetitive?

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:13.800
 Probably not.

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:14.620
 It's huge.

1:03:14.620 --> 1:03:15.600
 In my world, it's huge.

1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:17.840
 As a neurosurgeon, I target parts of the brain

1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:19.960
 that are three or four millimeters in size.

1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:22.360
 The nucleus accumbens is almost a centimeter in size.

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:23.200
 Wow.

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.320
 I didn't realize it was that large.

1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:25.160
 Yeah.

1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:26.380
 This sort of reminds me of discussions

1:03:26.380 --> 1:03:27.220
 around the amygdala.

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:28.800
 Everyone thinks amygdala fear,

1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:31.260
 but amygdala's got a lot of different subregions.

1:03:31.260 --> 1:03:33.840
 And stimulation of certain areas of the amygdala

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:34.840
 makes people feel great.

1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:35.680
 That's right.

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:36.840
 And stimulation of other areas

1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:38.420
 makes them feel terribly afraid.

1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:39.260
 Exactly.

1:03:39.260 --> 1:03:40.320
 And that shouldn't surprise us

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:43.560
 because when we treat patients with Parkinson's disease,

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:46.520
 for tremor, if we're in one part of the subthalamic nucleus,

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:47.480
 we'll help their tremor.

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:49.520
 If we're in another part of the subthalamic nucleus,

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:50.920
 the neurologist is looking at me like,

1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:52.440
 why isn't this working?

1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:53.540
 And that shouldn't surprise us.

1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:57.280
 We already know that two or three millimeters deviation

1:03:57.280 --> 1:03:59.540
 or two or three millimeters away from where we wanna be,

1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:01.160
 and you might not have the result you want.

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:02.360
 And that's probably also true

1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:04.080
 for these more limbic structures

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:07.000
 like the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens.

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.540
 So regarding the nucleus accumbens,

1:04:09.540 --> 1:04:13.260
 we traverse some of the nucleus accumbens, not all of it,

1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:16.440
 in order to place the electrode that we want to use

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:21.000
 to detect when cravings are happening, for example,

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.500
 and to try to block the cravings

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:27.080
 from leading to the behavior related to the reward seeking,

1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:28.960
 which is the overeating in this case.

1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:34.140
 So what we decided to do in the operating room

1:04:34.140 --> 1:04:38.360
 was to actually try to leverage a tool

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:39.440
 that we use all the time

1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:41.360
 when we take care of patients with Parkinson's.

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:43.220
 So with Parkinson's, a lot of these patients,

1:04:43.220 --> 1:04:45.040
 not all, have tremor.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:47.040
 And so when we place an electrode

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.840
 into this motor structure

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:52.560
 to try to improve their movement disorder,

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:55.280
 we often can hear tremor cells,

1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:58.440
 and they sound, we convert their electrical signal

1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:00.740
 to an audible signal so we can actually hear it.

1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:03.960
 And it sounds kind of like the tremor looks,

1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:05.520
 like the frequency of the signal

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:07.480
 is the same as the hand shaking.

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:09.600
 So a zzz, zzz, zzz, zzz. Exactly.

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:13.600
 And so the patient with Parkinson's is trembling.

1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:14.560
 They're awake.

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.480
 And you're poking around in a dedicated,

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:19.600
 careful way, of course.

1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:20.420
 One poke at a time.

1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:22.600
 One poke at a time with a very fine wire,

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:25.720
 a set of wires, listening to the electrical activity

1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:29.020
 until you encounter some cells

1:05:29.020 --> 1:05:31.880
 that are sending out electrical activity

1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:33.240
 at a similar frequency.

1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:34.060
 Exactly.

1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:36.220
 And then you can stimulate them or quiet them

1:05:36.220 --> 1:05:37.600
 and see if the tremor goes away.

1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:39.200
 So we are very confident

1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:41.640
 that when we stimulate that area of,

1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:43.700
 in this case, the subthalamic nucleus,

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:46.820
 we will make that tremor,

1:05:46.820 --> 1:05:48.880
 we will disrupt that tremor circuit

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.720
 and that tremor will dissolve.

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:51.560
 And it does.

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:54.160
 That's why Parkinson's is so beautiful and inspiring

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:55.000
 and from a surgical-

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:55.920
 And tractable.

1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:57.040
 Yeah, exactly.

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:57.880
 But what is the-

1:05:57.880 --> 1:05:59.720
 It makes us feel we understand the brain,

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:01.040
 at least in that limited way.

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:05.000
 So what is the analog to tremor

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.280
 in terms of appetite and desire to binge?

1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:08.340
 Craving.

1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:11.880
 So craving is a term that,

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.520
 there's probably other terms we could use by the way,

1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:15.480
 but that's the term we've chosen to use

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:16.800
 for a number of reasons.

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:19.020
 One, because people relate with that term.

1:06:19.020 --> 1:06:22.160
 People that have binge eating disorder or obesity,

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:23.680
 they, if you ask them if they crave,

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:25.880
 the answer will often be yes.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:28.480
 If you ask them if they lose control or binge,

1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:29.820
 they might not know what you mean,

1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:31.700
 or they might not actually feel out of control,

1:06:31.700 --> 1:06:32.640
 even when they are.

1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:37.280
 So, but the word craving is relatable.

1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:41.720
 And so we set out to see if we could identify craving cells.

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:46.500
 In a patient with OCD, which is related,

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:49.100
 in fact, we target a very similar part of the brain,

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:54.560
 we tried to identify cells related to obsessions.

1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:56.360
 And we believe we did do that.

1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:59.580
 It was a single case study where we tried to optimize

1:06:59.580 --> 1:07:01.200
 where our electrode was placed.

1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:03.560
 So we had some proof of concept

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:05.220
 that we would be able to elicit

1:07:05.220 --> 1:07:08.840
 a sort of disease-specific symptom in the operating room,

1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:11.320
 assuming the patient could tolerate being awake.

1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:13.500
 Not everybody needs to be awake for this procedure,

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:15.360
 but at least for these first human trials

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:18.560
 where we're trying to establish

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.440
 where in the brain we need to be,

1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:22.640
 I think this type of approach is really critical.

1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:27.440
 And by the way, none of this has been published,

1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:30.580
 but I think it's so important for people to know this.

1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:32.580
 So I am willing to share some aspects

1:07:32.580 --> 1:07:37.580
 of what we're trying to do, but that's really the first goal

1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:41.680
 of this trial is to identify

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:43.020
 where in the nucleus accumbens

1:07:43.020 --> 1:07:44.660
 we can detect these craving cells.

1:07:44.660 --> 1:07:47.100
 So we have to provoke food craving in the operating room.

1:07:47.100 --> 1:07:48.060
 That's the first thing.

1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:49.440
 How do you do that?

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:54.440
 Ah, well, there are some somewhat validated ways to do that.

1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:59.000
 So for example, we asked patients to provide pictures

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.280
 of food that they rate very highly

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:03.600
 as something that they would typically crave.

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.640
 And, you know, depending on the patient,

1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:07.240
 it might be something that's very salty.

1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:09.040
 It could be very sweet, like a donut.

1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:11.080
 Donuts are good.

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:11.920
 I love donuts.

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:13.160
 Right, donuts are great.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:15.360
 You should try the Cronut when you're here in New York City.

1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:17.880
 I just might, I try not to eat that sort of thing.

1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:19.800
 For all the reasons they change your brain,

1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:21.280
 it's worth one bite.

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:22.920
 Just try to stop yourself after that one bite.

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:24.200
 So if I were one of these patients,

1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:29.200
 given the fact that the binges come on pretty seldom

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:31.960
 once a day, do you, I imagine you have them come

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:35.240
 to the operating room fasted or semi-fasted?

1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:36.060
 They're fasted, yep.

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:37.320
 Okay, they're fasted, which probably,

1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:39.920
 there are probably surgical reasons for wanting that too.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:40.920
 Yes, they kind of have to be.

1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:44.200
 Right, and then you've done the craniotomy,

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:45.840
 you've removed a patch of skull,

1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:48.360
 lowered the wire into the nucleus accumbens,

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.940
 and then they are viewing pictures of food that they crave

1:08:51.940 --> 1:08:52.800
 and thinking about it.

1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:56.000
 Do they have olfactory cues, smells of Cronuts and donuts?

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.460
 Yeah, I would love to do the olfactory cues.

1:08:57.460 --> 1:08:58.480
 We haven't implemented that,

1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:00.760
 but that is a great thank you,

1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:02.000
 and I'll give you full credit when we do.

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.120
 Sure, I didn't review the grant, but it sounds,

1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:06.280
 I'm so glad this work is funded because I mean,

1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:09.240
 this is what I, I'll make, this time it's not a joke.

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:13.260
 When I referred to you all, you neurosurgeons,

1:09:14.300 --> 1:09:16.240
 as the astronauts of the brain,

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:21.240
 this is out on the extreme edge of what we don't know

1:09:21.820 --> 1:09:23.340
 about how the brain functions.

1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:25.200
 And this is so far and away different

1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.240
 than giving a mouse access to a high fat food.

1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:30.440
 Not that that, I'm not being disparaging of the mouse work,

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:34.640
 but so the person says, well, I'm the patient in this case,

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:36.400
 so I might say, you know, I'm hungry,

1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:38.600
 a donut sounds really good right now,

1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:41.720
 but craving to me is like, I, you know,

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:46.360
 I'll cross the street, cross town, be late for my meeting,

1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:49.640
 eat three of these, maybe even hide that

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:51.660
 from somebody that cares about me,

1:09:51.660 --> 1:09:53.520
 that doesn't want me doing this, this kind of thing,

1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:55.360
 hide it from myself.

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.280
 This, these kinds of behaviors I'm projecting,

1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:01.240
 I'm fortunate that I have cravings for things in life,

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:03.980
 but donuts are not among the more extreme of them.

1:10:03.980 --> 1:10:07.380
 So this is all happening in real time

1:10:07.380 --> 1:10:08.840
 and you're listening to the cells

1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:10.440
 the same way you would listen to it

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:11.680
 and search for tremor cells.

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:13.080
 Exactly, same exact tools.

1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:15.480
 And you're doing that by recording

1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:18.120
 from a small population of cells in the area?

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:21.320
 Yeah, in fact, we do get multi-unit activity,

1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:24.560
 which is multiple cells, but we really try to find one,

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:26.840
 a single unit to listen to.

1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:27.680
 One neuron.

1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:30.440
 Yeah, because it's just much easier to understand

1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:32.280
 what that one neuron is doing

1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:33.960
 versus trying to listen to multiple.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:37.200
 And we also measure local field potential recordings,

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:38.680
 but those are analyzed,

1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:41.640
 which is more of a population response, thousands of cells.

1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:43.200
 Kind of a chorus of cells.

1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:45.940
 Exactly, that we measure offline.

1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:52.160
 The device that we use to sort of treat these patients

1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:55.040
 or intervene that we're studying,

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:57.080
 it can't do single unit recordings.

1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:59.320
 It's only doing these more population responses.

1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:01.960
 So we correlate what we see in the operating room

1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:04.620
 at the single unit level to the population response,

1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:07.000
 but we do that all offline.

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.880
 I can explain that in a moment.

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:14.320
 But yeah, so we try to identify these craving cells

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:18.320
 and because this is a feasibility study

1:11:19.260 --> 1:11:21.960
 and we can't be in the operating room

1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:23.960
 searching for hours and hours and hours,

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:25.560
 we do have some sort of,

1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:27.800
 we have guidelines that we've set for ourselves,

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:31.600
 that we've developed with the NIH or the FDA

1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:33.620
 to make sure that what we're doing

1:11:33.620 --> 1:11:35.960
 is feasible and safe as well.

1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.160
 So we will spend a limited time

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:40.400
 trying to identify these craving cells.

1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:44.240
 But another sort of strategy

1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:45.880
 that we think is really important

1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:48.980
 is the effect of the stimulation.

1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:50.240
 So a lot of patients,

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:51.920
 and this gets to sort of your question earlier

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:54.120
 about what comes first.

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.260
 A lot of people when they binge

1:11:58.260 --> 1:12:03.120
 or they lose control over food or seek drugs,

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.560
 that moment of vulnerability is preceded

1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:11.560
 by what we call a moment of sort of pre-meal negative affect

1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:15.120
 which basically means right before they binge,

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:18.600
 they're feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious

1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:23.600
 and they compensate for that momentary symptom

1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.400
 by binging or losing control over food.

1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:29.000
 Not everybody meets criteria for a binge

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.160
 so I try to specify

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:32.960
 that we are looking at loss of control eating

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:36.240
 specifically just because the criterion of a binge

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:37.860
 is not as critical for us.

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:44.280
 So what we wanna be able to do is trigger stimulation

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:46.640
 when this craving is detected by the device.

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:51.640
 But we trigger it only when the craving is there

1:12:51.860 --> 1:12:54.780
 and we believe that if we can sort of

1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:58.540
 temporarily elevate their mood ever so briefly,

1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:01.720
 again this is about five to 10 seconds of stimulation only,

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:04.060
 that perhaps that elevation in mood

1:13:04.060 --> 1:13:09.060
 could actually sort of disrupt the craving to binge cycle.

1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:12.900
 Maybe that's a habit, maybe it's not.

1:13:12.900 --> 1:13:15.140
 But if you crave and then you binge,

1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:19.000
 if we can interrupt that with this moment of feeling good,

1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:22.540
 that might be a really good therapy for a patient.

1:13:22.540 --> 1:13:25.920
 And in fact, when we do deep brain stimulation

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:28.100
 for obsessive compulsive disorder,

1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:32.720
 we can fairly reliably induce a positive affect.

1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:35.140
 The problem is that it's not sustained

1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:37.140
 and the reason it's likely not sustained

1:13:37.140 --> 1:13:39.780
 is because with obsessive compulsive disorder,

1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:44.040
 we treat that condition with continuous stimulation.

1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:46.180
 And it's not surprising that over time

1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:47.780
 the effect kind of goes away.

1:13:47.780 --> 1:13:49.700
 So when they're in the clinic and we turn the device on,

1:13:49.700 --> 1:13:51.300
 our patients feel great

1:13:51.300 --> 1:13:54.340
 and we feel like we've solved the problem.

1:13:54.340 --> 1:13:56.420
 But they call us the next day and they're like,

1:13:56.420 --> 1:14:00.140
 my depression came back or my OCD hasn't gotten better

1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:02.200
 and my mood's back to where it was.

1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:03.940
 Can you get it back to where it was yesterday?

1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:05.140
 Because that felt great.

1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:07.060
 The brain loves homeostatic regulation.

1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:07.900
 It does.

1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:10.060
 And it does not like to shift patterns.

1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:11.060
 It's regression to the norm.

1:14:11.060 --> 1:14:12.020
 Right.

1:14:12.020 --> 1:14:15.220
 And I think there's sort of a tolerance effect there

1:14:15.220 --> 1:14:19.660
 that is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation.

1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:23.320
 And actually in a mouse, if you do continuous stimulation,

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:27.340
 the sort of blockade of binge eating goes away.

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:30.980
 So actually in a mouse, we've actually demonstrated,

1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:33.500
 we published this not too long ago in PNAS,

1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:37.320
 that if you deliver stimulation intermittently

1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:40.240
 and only when sort of a craving signal is detected,

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.940
 so to speak, that effect will be the most robust

1:14:44.940 --> 1:14:46.500
 and durable.

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:48.380
 But if you deliver it continuously,

1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:50.100
 actually the benefit goes away over time.

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:52.380
 So I've always encouraged my colleagues

1:14:52.380 --> 1:14:55.440
 to consider more of an episodic stimulation approach

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.280
 rather than continuous deep brain stimulation.

1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:00.380
 But of course that's for these more episodic conditions.

1:15:00.380 --> 1:15:02.900
 Whereas these more quote unquote state disorders,

1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:04.300
 as I oversimplified earlier,

1:15:04.300 --> 1:15:06.060
 they might need more of a continuous therapy.

1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:07.720
 So that's definitely subject

1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:10.400
 for a lot of research in the future.

1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:12.940
 So in any case, the goal in the operating room

1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:15.940
 was to identify a craving cell,

1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:20.020
 deliver stimulation safely,

1:15:20.020 --> 1:15:23.240
 but also to capture a moment of elevated mood.

1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.300
 We were able to do that

1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:28.340
 as we are in our OCD patients as well.

1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:31.540
 And also to get an intraoperative CAT scan.

1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:33.760
 We have devices now in the operating room

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:35.900
 that allow us to get imaging in real time.

1:15:35.900 --> 1:15:39.460
 They're fabulous tools that we didn't have 10 years ago.

1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:41.000
 So we can confirm accuracy.

1:15:42.660 --> 1:15:45.060
 You can see where the electrode is precisely.

1:15:45.060 --> 1:15:46.340
 Exactly.

1:15:46.340 --> 1:15:48.460
 With 0.5 millimeters of error.

1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:50.340
 So super precise,

1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:52.340
 or as precise as we think we need to be.

1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:55.940
 And we use connectomics.

1:15:55.940 --> 1:16:00.380
 So there's a tool in brain imaging called tractography

1:16:01.220 --> 1:16:03.980
 where we can actually measure circuit connections.

1:16:03.980 --> 1:16:05.660
 It's an indirect assay,

1:16:05.660 --> 1:16:07.420
 but we believe it's powerful.

1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:10.300
 It has its assumptions,

1:16:10.300 --> 1:16:13.300
 but like anything in science.

1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:16.940
 But we can actually map out

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:18.340
 where the nucleus accumbens

1:16:18.340 --> 1:16:21.480
 connects to the prefrontal cortex.

1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:25.020
 Sort of the cortical control and inhibitory control pathway

1:16:25.020 --> 1:16:26.660
 and where that pathway intersects

1:16:26.660 --> 1:16:27.940
 with the nucleus accumbens.

1:16:27.940 --> 1:16:31.580
 And we can target that area structurally.

1:16:31.580 --> 1:16:34.320
 So those three goals of the surgery

1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:37.060
 we aim to set out to accomplish.

1:16:37.060 --> 1:16:39.860
 And we believed if we achieved two of those three

1:16:39.860 --> 1:16:43.900
 that we would have a successful result in our early trial.

1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:45.620
 Amazing.

1:16:45.620 --> 1:16:49.020
 Given that at least to me, the non-clinician,

1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:54.020
 that anorexia is the mirror image of binge eating disorder.

1:16:54.540 --> 1:16:57.500
 And at least from what I learned,

1:16:57.500 --> 1:17:00.300
 one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions,

1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:02.940
 but also quite common.

1:17:02.940 --> 1:17:05.260
 Yes.

1:17:05.260 --> 1:17:07.500
 Is it possible that nucleus accumbens,

1:17:07.500 --> 1:17:10.460
 this so-called reward circuit,

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:12.820
 is also involved in anorexia,

1:17:12.820 --> 1:17:16.100
 but somehow it is the resistance to eating,

1:17:16.100 --> 1:17:18.220
 the craving of the fasted state

1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:20.940
 or something like that that's being reinforced.

1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:22.460
 And I asked this for two reasons.

1:17:22.460 --> 1:17:25.640
 One, because I'm genuinely curious about anorexia.

1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:27.780
 I've observed anorexia in a number of people I know,

1:17:27.780 --> 1:17:31.700
 and it's a striking thing to see somebody

1:17:31.700 --> 1:17:36.180
 just resist food despite all better knowledge

1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:38.500
 of the fact that they're getting quite ill,

1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:40.580
 maybe even at risk of death.

1:17:40.580 --> 1:17:45.580
 But the other reason is that if in fact nucleus accumbens

1:17:45.620 --> 1:17:50.620
 is the site which can harbor cells to promote craving

1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:55.940
 and craving of fasted states, so to speak,

1:17:55.940 --> 1:17:58.260
 then that I think might tell us something fundamental

1:17:58.260 --> 1:17:59.140
 about how the brain works,

1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:02.500
 which is that structures don't control functions per se,

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:05.980
 structures control dynamics of interactions.

1:18:05.980 --> 1:18:09.940
 Sort of like a orchestra conductor

1:18:09.940 --> 1:18:12.140
 has a certain number of operations that they perform,

1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:13.540
 but really their main function

1:18:13.540 --> 1:18:16.100
 is to coordinate the actions of a lot of things,

1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:18.420
 not to make sure that the violins always play

1:18:18.420 --> 1:18:21.500
 in a certain way alongside the oboes.

1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:23.100
 You can tell I'm not a musician here.

1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:26.040
 I actually have an appreciation for the oboes.

1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:27.020
 Those usually get left out.

1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:27.860
 What's that, the oboes?

1:18:27.860 --> 1:18:29.860
 Yeah, they usually get ignored.

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:31.020
 My partner plays the oboes.

1:18:31.020 --> 1:18:31.860
 Oh, wow.

1:18:31.860 --> 1:18:32.700
 Yeah, so.

1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:34.740
 I think it's a great analogy, by the way.

1:18:36.260 --> 1:18:38.780
 I make this statement, it's a little controversial,

1:18:38.780 --> 1:18:40.940
 but I actually think people would understand

1:18:40.940 --> 1:18:43.980
 where I'm coming from across all of these

1:18:43.980 --> 1:18:46.820
 sort of subspecialties of medicine.

1:18:46.820 --> 1:18:49.420
 But I actually think, especially with obesity,

1:18:49.420 --> 1:18:52.320
 remember it's a phenotype that's reflective often,

1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:54.660
 but not always of a behavior.

1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:57.660
 But if you consider patients that have obesity

1:18:57.660 --> 1:19:00.620
 and they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards food,

1:19:00.620 --> 1:19:03.300
 so they overeat despite the risk of it,

1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:06.020
 I think those kinds of patients are more similar

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:08.340
 to anorexics than they are different.

1:19:08.340 --> 1:19:11.620
 Anorexia and obesity are both phenotypes that are,

1:19:11.620 --> 1:19:15.180
 at least in this specific case of obesity and anorexia,

1:19:15.180 --> 1:19:18.300
 a result of a compulsion to either over or under eat

1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:20.380
 despite the risk.

1:19:20.380 --> 1:19:24.060
 These types of compulsions are driven by societal pressures,

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:27.660
 brain vulnerabilities that are probably more similar

1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:29.300
 than they are different.

1:19:29.300 --> 1:19:32.740
 They just happen to manifest differently.

1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:34.860
 Why they manifest differently is probably related

1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:37.740
 to each patient's predisposition,

1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:40.220
 or perhaps preference, that's hard to know.

1:19:41.100 --> 1:19:43.220
 Like you, I have a personal connection

1:19:43.220 --> 1:19:45.580
 to these eating disorders, anorexia included,

1:19:45.580 --> 1:19:49.940
 and yeah, I think it's very scary.

1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:54.940
 And it's a condition that often instills fear

1:19:55.860 --> 1:20:00.860
 in psychiatrists, because I think not everybody,

1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:03.740
 by the way, I have some phenomenal psychiatrists

1:20:03.740 --> 1:20:06.860
 that I work with, both at Stanford and at Penn.

1:20:06.860 --> 1:20:08.500
 They're also involved in my obesity study

1:20:08.500 --> 1:20:09.660
 that take care of these patients.

1:20:09.660 --> 1:20:12.460
 I mean, these are heroes, but there's a lot of psychiatrists

1:20:12.460 --> 1:20:15.140
 that are not in this domain that find anorexia scary

1:20:15.140 --> 1:20:15.980
 for the reason you said.

1:20:15.980 --> 1:20:19.460
 It has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions.

1:20:19.460 --> 1:20:22.260
 That includes depression, because not only

1:20:22.260 --> 1:20:23.500
 can these patients die of suicide,

1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:25.420
 but they die of metabolic complications

1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:26.540
 of being underweight.

1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:31.300
 So it is a scary condition.

1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:33.340
 I relate with that.

1:20:33.340 --> 1:20:37.140
 I am trying, over time, to bridge what I'm doing

1:20:37.140 --> 1:20:39.780
 in obesity and binging disorder to anorexia,

1:20:39.780 --> 1:20:40.620
 for two reasons.

1:20:40.620 --> 1:20:42.780
 One, because I think these problems are more similar

1:20:42.780 --> 1:20:45.820
 than they are different, and two, because of the need.

1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:50.060
 And I think we're well positioned to sort of tackle

1:20:50.060 --> 1:20:54.780
 anorexia using similar approaches, not identical,

1:20:54.780 --> 1:20:56.860
 but similar approaches.

1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:59.260
 The nucleus accumbens has been studied in patients

1:20:59.260 --> 1:21:01.500
 with anorexia in China.

1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:03.980
 Actually, my postdoc, my first postdoc,

1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:07.140
 who I had the honor to train when I was at Stanford

1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:10.180
 as a neurosurgeon in China, before he came to me,

1:21:10.180 --> 1:21:12.300
 actually was involved in a trial of anorexia

1:21:12.300 --> 1:21:13.500
 that had some benefits.

1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:18.500
 And there's studies in Europe and elsewhere

1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:22.940
 that have examined, preliminarily, the effects

1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:25.740
 of deep brain stimulation targeting the nucleus accumbens.

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:29.940
 Four anorexia colleagues of mine in Canada,

1:21:29.940 --> 1:21:33.660
 Andres Lozados, a wonderful neurosurgeon scientist,

1:21:33.660 --> 1:21:36.420
 has been studying the effects of going after area 25,

1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:39.060
 which is directly connected to the nucleus accumbens

1:21:39.060 --> 1:21:42.460
 by, you know, it's a monosynaptic connection,

1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:44.060
 so in a lot of ways, you know,

1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:47.300
 perhaps delivering stimulation there could be very similar

1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:49.100
 to delivering stimulation with the nucleus accumbens.

1:21:49.100 --> 1:21:52.300
 It's all part of one critical inhibitory control circuit.

1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:54.260
 He's seen benefits as well.

1:21:56.340 --> 1:21:58.500
 So I definitely think there's some evidence

1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:01.900
 that this is an area that we need to be studying.

1:22:01.900 --> 1:22:03.500
 I think our more episodic approach

1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:06.620
 with responsive stimulation going after sort of a signal

1:22:06.620 --> 1:22:09.020
 in the nucleus accumbens that seems to be related

1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:12.580
 to the compulsion to withhold for meeting,

1:22:12.580 --> 1:22:15.380
 I think is what we will be trying to accomplish

1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:16.220
 in our study.

1:22:16.220 --> 1:22:19.260
 It's right now just being conceived, though.

1:22:20.460 --> 1:22:22.740
 These studies, they move so slowly

1:22:22.740 --> 1:22:24.500
 because you have to get a grant.

1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:26.300
 That grant gets reviewed by the NIH

1:22:26.300 --> 1:22:28.300
 six months after you submit it,

1:22:28.300 --> 1:22:31.220
 often gets rejected because it's too innovative

1:22:31.220 --> 1:22:34.260
 and too high risk, so then you have to edit it

1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:35.620
 and decrease the risk.

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:38.700
 So it takes, my obesity study took two years to get funded.

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:41.300
 And I worry about that timeframe

1:22:41.300 --> 1:22:43.500
 because that's a lot of time for patients

1:22:43.500 --> 1:22:45.900
 with anorexia to suffer that I might be able to help

1:22:45.900 --> 1:22:47.500
 at least in a small sample of patients.

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:51.020
 So, but that is the nature of how these things go.

1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:52.340
 You also have to get FDA approval

1:22:52.340 --> 1:22:53.580
 to do these kinds of things.

1:22:53.580 --> 1:22:54.980
 We try to do all of this in parallel.

1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:56.780
 It's an enormous undertaking.

1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.700
 And in a lot of ways, we're starting from scratch,

1:22:58.700 --> 1:23:00.860
 but in some ways, we have some preliminary data

1:23:00.860 --> 1:23:01.900
 to go after this.

1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:03.700
 So my hope is in about a year,

1:23:03.700 --> 1:23:06.100
 we'll have a similar trial for anorexia at Penn,

1:23:06.100 --> 1:23:08.540
 so more to come on that.

1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:11.540
 And we're not the only lab that's trying to go after it

1:23:11.540 --> 1:23:14.220
 because of the clear need, so.

1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:17.460
 What is the status of non-invasive brain stimulation,

1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:20.340
 ablation, and blocking activity in the brain?

1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:21.340
 I get a lot of questions

1:23:21.340 --> 1:23:23.620
 about transcranial magnetic stimulation.

1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:26.180
 I've actually had that done as a research subject.

1:23:26.180 --> 1:23:27.020
 Sure.

1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:27.940
 When I was at Berkeley, Rich Ivory's lab

1:23:27.940 --> 1:23:29.180
 put a coil on my head.

1:23:29.180 --> 1:23:33.100
 I was tapping my finger in concert to a drum beat.

1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:35.860
 And then all of a sudden, because of the stimulation,

1:23:35.860 --> 1:23:38.100
 it was impossible for me to keep time.

1:23:38.100 --> 1:23:38.940
 Yes.

1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:39.780
 With the drum beat.

1:23:39.780 --> 1:23:40.620
 That's cool.

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:44.220
 It's a pretty wild experience to not have motor control

1:23:44.220 --> 1:23:47.860
 and then to have motor control returned

1:23:47.860 --> 1:23:49.580
 at the flip of a switch

1:23:49.580 --> 1:23:51.340
 when someone else is controlling the switch.

1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:52.780
 It makes it especially eerie.

1:23:53.820 --> 1:23:55.140
 So my understanding is

1:23:55.140 --> 1:23:56.700
 that transcranial magnetic stimulation

1:23:56.700 --> 1:23:57.940
 is being used to treat depression

1:23:57.940 --> 1:24:02.380
 and a number of other brain syndromes non-invasively,

1:24:02.380 --> 1:24:03.960
 so no drilling through the skull.

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:04.940
 Surgeons don't like that.

1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:07.620
 Surgeons love to cut and drill with purpose,

1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:08.460
 but they do.

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:09.300
 With purpose, yes.

1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:13.540
 But my understanding is that the spatial precision

1:24:13.540 --> 1:24:14.620
 isn't that great.

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:15.700
 Yes.

1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:19.640
 Ultrasound is something I hear a lot about these days.

1:24:19.640 --> 1:24:21.340
 And my understanding is that ultrasound

1:24:21.340 --> 1:24:23.580
 can allow researchers and clinicians

1:24:23.580 --> 1:24:25.460
 to stimulate specific brain areas,

1:24:25.460 --> 1:24:27.440
 perhaps with more precision.

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.420
 Maybe you could just give us a brief coverage

1:24:29.420 --> 1:24:31.020
 of what those are being used for.

1:24:31.020 --> 1:24:36.020
 What are your thoughts on these forms of non-invasive,

1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:37.140
 non-invasive,

1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:39.920
 meaning no flipping open of a piece of the skull

1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:44.380
 type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity?

1:24:44.380 --> 1:24:45.220
 Sure.

1:24:45.220 --> 1:24:46.500
 Yeah, I wanted to clarify also.

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:49.820
 These surgeries generally don't, by the way,

1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:51.980
 require a full craniotomy.

1:24:51.980 --> 1:24:53.340
 It's usually just a small opening

1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:55.000
 about the size of a dime in the bone.

1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.660
 So just to clarify.

1:24:56.660 --> 1:24:58.100
 Painless too, right?

1:24:58.100 --> 1:24:59.420
 Well, usually without pain.

1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:01.260
 Yeah, a little bit of scalp numbing.

1:25:01.260 --> 1:25:02.580
 We give a scalp block

1:25:02.580 --> 1:25:04.540
 and the patients are getting IV sedation.

1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:06.620
 So they, in general, don't feel anything.

1:25:06.620 --> 1:25:07.780
 And if they do, they tell me

1:25:07.780 --> 1:25:09.160
 and we give them more local anesthetic,

1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:11.700
 but they're usually asleep during that part.

1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:12.800
 So it's minimally invasive.

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:14.860
 But in a lot of ways, there's no such thing

1:25:14.860 --> 1:25:17.340
 as a minimally invasive procedure in the brain.

1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:18.160
 It's kind of a misnomer.

1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:19.740
 I'm so glad to hear you say that.

1:25:19.740 --> 1:25:22.820
 Oh no, I am not one of those neurosurgeons

1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:24.080
 that you've probably encountered.

1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:26.160
 And we have mutual friends that,

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:29.300
 and these mutual friends are some of my favorite people

1:25:29.300 --> 1:25:30.140
 in neurosurgery.

1:25:30.140 --> 1:25:32.500
 And they probably actually think more like me than not.

1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:34.100
 But there are neurosurgeons

1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:34.940
 that you're absolutely right.

1:25:34.940 --> 1:25:36.180
 And this is true for all surgeries.

1:25:36.180 --> 1:25:38.380
 They really, in a lot of ways,

1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:40.420
 they think what they do is sort of the ground truth

1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:42.260
 or closer to the ground truth.

1:25:42.260 --> 1:25:47.060
 And I get that, you know, probing with purpose.

1:25:47.060 --> 1:25:48.980
 I actually really liked that.

1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:50.620
 I'm gonna use that, if you don't mind.

1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:54.220
 It's just describing what you do.

1:25:54.220 --> 1:25:57.620
 But I actually have always said this.

1:25:57.620 --> 1:25:58.500
 I've said it publicly.

1:25:58.500 --> 1:25:59.740
 I've said it to my boss.

1:25:59.740 --> 1:26:02.260
 I've said this to my team.

1:26:02.260 --> 1:26:04.500
 We need to embrace non-invasive approaches.

1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:08.340
 Some of them are a little fluffy.

1:26:09.260 --> 1:26:12.340
 Fluffy in that we don't understand how they work.

1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:13.220
 We don't necessarily understand

1:26:13.220 --> 1:26:16.380
 how deep brain stimulation works, by the way.

1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:18.820
 But because we don't know exactly how they work,

1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:20.660
 they're not as precise as we would like them to be.

1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:21.780
 So we have work to do there.

1:26:21.780 --> 1:26:24.420
 And I actually think that work is doable

1:26:24.420 --> 1:26:25.640
 and actually underway.

1:26:27.420 --> 1:26:29.020
 At Stanford, we have great collaborators

1:26:29.020 --> 1:26:30.520
 that I think are doing this.

1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:32.900
 People like Nolan Williams and Connor Liston

1:26:32.900 --> 1:26:34.440
 at Cornell and others.

1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:39.060
 So we, I think that TMS,

1:26:39.060 --> 1:26:41.060
 transprinomagnetic stimulation,

1:26:41.060 --> 1:26:43.280
 it is FDA-approved for depression, by the way.

1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:46.500
 It's also FDA-approved for OCD and for nicotine addiction.

1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:49.820
 Where do they put the coil for those three, or more or less?

1:26:49.820 --> 1:26:52.500
 Yeah, so they put it over, well, it's always on the scalp

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:54.980
 and over the frontal lobe.

1:26:54.980 --> 1:26:56.560
 And there's different parts of the frontal lobe

1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:59.580
 that have been demonstrated to be a little better

1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:00.820
 or a little bit worse.

1:27:01.700 --> 1:27:04.860
 But what the FDA has approved for depression,

1:27:04.860 --> 1:27:09.020
 I believe is similar to what's been approved for OCD.

1:27:09.020 --> 1:27:11.420
 But for addiction, I believe it is a different target.

1:27:11.420 --> 1:27:14.100
 But we'd have to ask our TMS experts on that.

1:27:14.100 --> 1:27:16.500
 Can they direct the transprinomagnetic stimulation

1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:17.580
 deep below the cortex?

1:27:17.580 --> 1:27:18.660
 They try.

1:27:18.660 --> 1:27:22.280
 And we're actually studying this in OCD patients now.

1:27:23.820 --> 1:27:26.500
 As a part of our invasive trial,

1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:29.420
 we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial

1:27:29.420 --> 1:27:31.940
 that's in parallel to what we're doing,

1:27:31.940 --> 1:27:34.640
 all funded by the Foundation for OCD Research,

1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:40.260
 where we believe we can use TMS to define a circuit

1:27:40.260 --> 1:27:45.260
 that, if modulated, improves OCD, albeit temporarily.

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:47.500
 And in those patients, if it's temporary,

1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:49.700
 they would be appropriate for an invasive study.

1:27:49.700 --> 1:27:52.820
 So something we're actively working on.

1:27:52.820 --> 1:27:55.480
 I've always believed that neurosurgeons need to be part

1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:57.940
 of the discussion with these non-invasive approaches.

1:27:57.940 --> 1:27:59.780
 We don't need to do them.

1:27:59.780 --> 1:28:03.920
 But I think we can help make them more precise

1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:07.380
 and to probe non-invasively with purpose,

1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:13.180
 rather than this more kind of, I don't know,

1:28:13.180 --> 1:28:17.060
 a non-invasive blast effect kind of, you know,

1:28:17.060 --> 1:28:19.820
 I just can't imagine how that is gonna be as effective

1:28:19.820 --> 1:28:21.780
 as probing with purpose.

1:28:21.780 --> 1:28:23.500
 But you can do that non-invasively as well.

1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:26.140
 And I think we need to do better in that way.

1:28:26.140 --> 1:28:27.240
 I do believe that's possible,

1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:30.100
 and I think people are actively trying to do it.

1:28:30.100 --> 1:28:31.420
 Getting deep in the brain with TMS,

1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:32.620
 I think, will always be hard.

1:28:32.620 --> 1:28:34.580
 But you can get there indirectly

1:28:34.580 --> 1:28:36.540
 by using connectivity assays

1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:38.820
 and targeting superficial structures

1:28:38.820 --> 1:28:42.780
 that have high connectivity to deep structures.

1:28:43.660 --> 1:28:46.260
 So for example, perhaps one day,

1:28:46.260 --> 1:28:50.120
 there will be a TMS target for anorexia and obesity.

1:28:51.540 --> 1:28:53.380
 If we are scratching the surface

1:28:53.380 --> 1:28:55.940
 with invasive approaches to these problems,

1:28:55.940 --> 1:28:59.920
 we're even doing less with the brain stimulation.

1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:01.640
 So we have so much work to do there.

1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:06.000
 Eating disorders and TMS have been so sort

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.880
 of scarcely studied,

1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:12.360
 or there have been such little research done in that space.

1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:14.920
 So it is an area that we need to work on.

1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:17.460
 For the obvious reason, for example,

1:29:17.460 --> 1:29:20.000
 in a patient with anorexia, just thinking practically,

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.740
 you know, placing a device in a patient

1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:23.640
 who is significantly underweight

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:25.360
 might not be the best approach.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:28.480
 You know, wound erosion and issues like that could come up.

1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:31.340
 So developing a non-invasive approach, I think, is critical.

1:29:31.340 --> 1:29:34.680
 The problem is, where do we target?

1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:37.880
 And so the only way to answer that, I think, reliably,

1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:40.640
 is to accept that we have to get into the brain

1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:42.560
 before we're out of the brain.

1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:43.720
 And with these kinds of conditions,

1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.200
 we're only just starting to get into the brain, you know?

1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:49.320
 So I worry that we're a long way away

1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:50.840
 from a non-invasive approach

1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:52.700
 that really works consistently.

1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:55.940
 I'm sorry to interrupt.

1:29:55.940 --> 1:29:57.940
 I want to make sure we touch on ultrasound.

1:29:57.940 --> 1:30:02.620
 Because historically it seemed

1:30:02.620 --> 1:30:04.620
 that there was a bit more permission

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:06.600
 for people to probe around in the human brain.

1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:11.200
 I sometimes refer podcasts to some of these papers

1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:14.300
 that were done allowing patients

1:30:14.300 --> 1:30:16.100
 to self-stimulate in the brain.

1:30:16.100 --> 1:30:18.500
 These are work done in the sixties,

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:21.180
 and now his name escapes me, Robert.

1:30:21.180 --> 1:30:22.860
 Anyway, there's a couple of papers published in Science

1:30:22.860 --> 1:30:24.520
 allowing patients to stimulate

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:25.540
 a couple of different brain areas,

1:30:25.540 --> 1:30:26.940
 asking which ones they preferred.

1:30:26.940 --> 1:30:29.900
 And I was always shocked and slightly intrigued

1:30:29.900 --> 1:30:31.860
 by the fact that the brain area

1:30:31.860 --> 1:30:33.460
 that all three of these patients,

1:30:33.460 --> 1:30:34.900
 who I don't think had any syndromes,

1:30:34.900 --> 1:30:37.180
 I think they volunteered for these experiments.

1:30:37.180 --> 1:30:38.580
 I don't think you could do this anymore.

1:30:38.580 --> 1:30:43.140
 Yes, regulatory was not the same as it is now.

1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:45.380
 Things have changed, fortunately.

1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:48.620
 But all three of them

1:30:48.620 --> 1:30:50.880
 seem to like some midline thalamic structure,

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:52.180
 which for those listening is just an area

1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:56.400
 kind of in the dead center of the brain, more or less,

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:59.660
 that evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger,

1:30:59.660 --> 1:31:01.700
 which surprised me because I would have thought,

1:31:01.700 --> 1:31:03.780
 oh, it's Robert Heath, these experiments,

1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:05.920
 rather than patients preferring to stimulate areas

1:31:05.920 --> 1:31:07.460
 that evoke laughter or joy

1:31:07.460 --> 1:31:10.700
 or a feeling of drunkenness or delight.

1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:13.500
 It also explains a lot of what I observe in social media,

1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:17.880
 the sort of kind of people repeatedly engaging in battles

1:31:17.880 --> 1:31:19.060
 that are kind of trivial.

1:31:19.060 --> 1:31:20.540
 It seems like frustration and anger

1:31:20.540 --> 1:31:23.100
 might have its own reward circuitry.

1:31:23.100 --> 1:31:25.220
 Anyway, I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole,

1:31:25.220 --> 1:31:27.020
 but it-

1:31:27.020 --> 1:31:27.840
 It's a deep one.

1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:28.680
 It's a deep one.

1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:32.260
 And kind of gets to our nature as humans

1:31:32.260 --> 1:31:34.820
 and what we find interesting or rewarding.

1:31:34.820 --> 1:31:39.820
 But the inability to probe around the brain in a safe way

1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:46.220
 without the need for somebody to be very sick

1:31:46.220 --> 1:31:48.100
 would be, I think, would be enormously powerful.

1:31:48.100 --> 1:31:50.380
 And at least to my mind, if I were in charge,

1:31:50.380 --> 1:31:53.500
 which I'm not, would offer the opportunity

1:31:53.500 --> 1:31:55.820
 to really come to an understanding

1:31:55.820 --> 1:31:58.780
 about how the human brain works without all these issues

1:31:58.780 --> 1:32:00.580
 of how to translate for mouse studies.

1:32:00.580 --> 1:32:02.700
 And again, there's huge value to animal studies

1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:03.540
 as we both agree,

1:32:03.540 --> 1:32:06.980
 but so many of the things that we want to know

1:32:06.980 --> 1:32:09.780
 about the human brain involve asking the person,

1:32:09.780 --> 1:32:12.180
 hey, what do you feel when that set of neurons

1:32:12.180 --> 1:32:14.820
 is stimulated and what don't you feel?

1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:16.920
 And a mouse, we can ask and ask,

1:32:16.920 --> 1:32:17.760
 but they're not going to tell us them.

1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:19.740
 They do tell us, they're not going to tell us in English.

1:32:19.740 --> 1:32:23.040
 So how do we overcome this challenge?

1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:27.380
 But first ultrasound, or if you prefer after ultrasound,

1:32:27.380 --> 1:32:28.780
 is ultrasound going to be really useful

1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:30.440
 towards solving these clinical issues

1:32:30.440 --> 1:32:31.480
 and these basic issues?

1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:35.420
 Yeah, so I think, let's start with ultrasound

1:32:35.420 --> 1:32:37.000
 and then we'll come back to it.

1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.020
 So ultrasound right now,

1:32:39.020 --> 1:32:44.020
 transcranial magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound.

1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:49.020
 So this is an FDA approved method

1:32:49.460 --> 1:32:54.460
 to deliver an ablation to the brain noninvasively.

1:32:54.860 --> 1:32:57.380
 There are researchers, myself included,

1:32:57.380 --> 1:33:00.540
 that are trying to use transcranial magnetic guided,

1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:02.580
 magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound

1:33:02.580 --> 1:33:04.460
 or MRI guided focus ultrasound

1:33:05.740 --> 1:33:08.420
 to use it in a modulatory way, not just as an ablation,

1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:11.940
 but to drive neuronal activity or inhibit it perhaps.

1:33:11.940 --> 1:33:13.700
 We're still learning how to do that.

1:33:13.700 --> 1:33:17.380
 There are trials that are trying to understand

1:33:17.380 --> 1:33:19.540
 if you can use ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier

1:33:19.540 --> 1:33:23.940
 so you can deliver a medication to that specific area,

1:33:23.940 --> 1:33:26.660
 perhaps for a brain tumor or something like that.

1:33:26.660 --> 1:33:29.780
 So it's a very exciting field

1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:32.020
 and it is FDA approved for tremor right now.

1:33:32.020 --> 1:33:34.460
 And so I actually do it routinely

1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:37.180
 for patients with tremor,

1:33:37.180 --> 1:33:39.380
 with Parkinson's or a central tremor.

1:33:39.380 --> 1:33:41.580
 And so I love doing it.

1:33:41.580 --> 1:33:44.380
 It's often just kind of a miracle

1:33:44.380 --> 1:33:45.540
 because there's no incision.

1:33:45.540 --> 1:33:47.120
 I don't have to place an electrode into the brain

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:49.100
 to achieve a similar result.

1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:52.540
 How early into the pathology of Parkinson's

1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:54.260
 can someone think about approaching this?

1:33:54.260 --> 1:33:57.540
 So for instance, if somebody has a parent or a sibling

1:33:57.540 --> 1:33:59.780
 and they're developing some resting tremor,

1:33:59.780 --> 1:34:01.380
 obviously they should talk to a neurologist,

1:34:01.380 --> 1:34:02.940
 but a neurosurgeon,

1:34:02.940 --> 1:34:06.820
 but this noninvasive approach could be incredible for them

1:34:06.820 --> 1:34:09.720
 as opposed to just only taking drugs

1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:11.180
 to increase dopamine levels.

1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:13.900
 Yeah, so depending on the reason you have tremor

1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:15.980
 would dictate the kind of medication you would use.

1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:16.900
 It could be Parkinson's,

1:34:16.900 --> 1:34:18.420
 but if it's not, it might be a central tremor.

1:34:18.420 --> 1:34:20.220
 By the way, central tremor is 10 times

1:34:20.220 --> 1:34:22.140
 as common as Parkinson's.

1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:24.780
 Essential tremor is the most common neurologic condition

1:34:24.780 --> 1:34:27.060
 in patients over the age of 70.

1:34:27.060 --> 1:34:29.520
 We often aren't aware of that.

1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:30.460
 People with a central tremor

1:34:30.460 --> 1:34:31.860
 feel they have their forgotten disease

1:34:31.860 --> 1:34:34.940
 because there's no Michael J. Fox for a central tremor.

1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:36.260
 I sent a letter to Bill-

1:34:36.260 --> 1:34:38.180
 Sorry, is it essential tremor or-

1:34:38.180 --> 1:34:39.700
 Yes, essential tremor.

1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:41.940
 Yeah, E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A-L.

1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:46.180
 I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton.

1:34:46.180 --> 1:34:48.740
 I've observed tremor in him

1:34:48.740 --> 1:34:50.620
 and I think he's actually disclosed that he has it

1:34:50.620 --> 1:34:52.780
 and I hoped he'd become a champion

1:34:52.780 --> 1:34:55.200
 for patients with a central tremor.

1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:56.620
 Sandra Day O'Connor does as well.

1:34:56.620 --> 1:34:57.780
 She's also public about it,

1:34:57.780 --> 1:35:00.180
 but I was not able to get them eager

1:35:00.180 --> 1:35:01.920
 to become the champion for this condition,

1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:03.480
 but like Michael J. Fox,

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:05.660
 these patients need a champion like that,

1:35:05.660 --> 1:35:10.100
 but unfortunately, it's a bit of a forgotten disease.

1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:12.420
 Nevertheless, because of the FDA approval

1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:14.280
 of Focus Ultrasound for tremor,

1:35:15.860 --> 1:35:17.660
 they're just trying to get some attention for sure

1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:20.540
 and it's fabulously effective for these patients.

1:35:20.540 --> 1:35:21.780
 It treats patients on one side,

1:35:21.780 --> 1:35:24.220
 usually their dominant hand or their worse hand,

1:35:24.220 --> 1:35:27.320
 and it really speaks to the fact that, wow,

1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:31.020
 you can deliver noninvasively an ablation to the brain

1:35:31.020 --> 1:35:34.540
 in a hypothesized zone that we think is related

1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:35.840
 to the problem at hand,

1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:38.580
 and at least with tremor, it works really well.

1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:41.300
 Could this be effective for psychiatric disease,

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:44.040
 obesity, eating disorders?

1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:46.820
 Well, perhaps.

1:35:46.820 --> 1:35:48.620
 Actually, that would be the ideal.

1:35:48.620 --> 1:35:51.580
 The problem is we don't know where to do the ablation.

1:35:52.820 --> 1:35:55.260
 There is a trial that we would like to do for OCD

1:35:55.260 --> 1:35:56.940
 where we would deliver an ablation

1:35:56.940 --> 1:35:58.220
 to the same area of the brain

1:35:58.220 --> 1:36:00.420
 that we've been delivering ablations to for years

1:36:00.420 --> 1:36:02.200
 for patients with OCD and it helps a bit.

1:36:02.200 --> 1:36:05.340
 That's called a capsulotomy, but really,

1:36:05.340 --> 1:36:07.100
 the outcome is probably gonna be about the same.

1:36:07.100 --> 1:36:09.860
 It's a nice method because it's noninvasive,

1:36:09.860 --> 1:36:13.260
 but we need to find a new target for these conditions,

1:36:13.260 --> 1:36:17.340
 and because of the common denominator of the urge

1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:20.160
 despite the risk, sort of that compulsion,

1:36:21.220 --> 1:36:22.580
 perhaps it could be the same target.

1:36:22.580 --> 1:36:25.440
 I don't know, but I would argue we need

1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:28.700
 to do these modulatory experiments either with a device

1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:32.480
 or with invasive recordings to better understand

1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:34.380
 where these problems are coming from

1:36:34.380 --> 1:36:37.880
 to define where we should do an ultrasound treatment.

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.860
 So you're right.

1:36:39.860 --> 1:36:43.540
 Historically, without much regulation,

1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:45.160
 we've probed the brain.

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:49.020
 The problem, we can't learn a lot

1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:52.740
 from those experiments now, well, in this way at least.

1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:54.780
 We don't know exactly where those electrodes were.

1:36:54.780 --> 1:36:57.900
 We didn't have MRI scanning or high-quality CAT scanning

1:36:57.900 --> 1:37:01.180
 to know where those electrodes were with certainty,

1:37:01.180 --> 1:37:03.660
 and we know two or three millimeters matters,

1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:06.560
 and we also didn't have the tools to place electrodes

1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:08.820
 in a precise way back then.

1:37:08.820 --> 1:37:10.720
 So unfortunately, we can't learn a lot

1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:12.760
 from those experiments right now.

1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:14.620
 So we're sort of redesigning them,

1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:17.260
 and there is a way to do it now.

1:37:17.260 --> 1:37:19.860
 Patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time.

1:37:19.860 --> 1:37:22.140
 There has been a revolution in America.

1:37:22.140 --> 1:37:24.220
 It was in Europe before it was in America

1:37:24.220 --> 1:37:26.860
 where we would do stereoencephalography,

1:37:26.860 --> 1:37:29.460
 which is basically like doing an EEG

1:37:29.460 --> 1:37:32.760
 of patients with epilepsy, but with invasive electrodes,

1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:34.480
 and we would place tiny little wires,

1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:36.160
 less than a millimeter in diameter,

1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:38.020
 all throughout the brain into parts of the brain

1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:40.280
 that we believe are involved in seizures,

1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:42.380
 and we would admit the patients to the hospital

1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.440
 and figure out where the seizures were starting

1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:47.580
 and propagating, and then we could stimulate

1:37:47.580 --> 1:37:49.380
 through these electrodes to see if there was a symptom

1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:52.740
 that was important and try to identify a region

1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:55.940
 that we thought we could either remove surgically,

1:37:55.940 --> 1:37:59.520
 ablate with a laser, or put a stimulator in it, perhaps.

1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:02.480
 That's commonplace now for epilepsy,

1:38:03.780 --> 1:38:06.340
 and it works extremely well, and it's very safe.

1:38:06.340 --> 1:38:08.660
 Of course, it's still a brain procedure,

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:12.540
 but the complication rate is surprisingly low,

1:38:12.540 --> 1:38:15.440
 quite honestly, for the amount of electrodes that we place,

1:38:16.440 --> 1:38:17.620
 and it's extremely well tolerated.

1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:18.940
 Most of these patients leave the hospital,

1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:21.180
 and they don't even feel like they've had surgery.

1:38:21.180 --> 1:38:23.300
 So there's actually a lot of interest

1:38:23.300 --> 1:38:27.480
 in using that procedure to study mental health disorders.

1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:30.660
 We are trying to do it for patients

1:38:30.660 --> 1:38:32.500
 with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:35.140
 We're awaiting an FDA decision on that,

1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:38.700
 but actually, I credit our colleagues at Baylor

1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:42.360
 and at UCSF for studying this already.

1:38:43.300 --> 1:38:45.920
 We have fabulous colleagues at UCSF

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:49.080
 that have studied depression using this type of approach,

1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:52.780
 a mutual friend of ours, you know, Eddie Chang,

1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:55.380
 who's a wonderful friend and colleague,

1:38:55.380 --> 1:38:58.260
 somebody I've emulated for many years as well,

1:38:58.260 --> 1:39:01.260
 and the psychiatry team at UCSF have worked together

1:39:01.260 --> 1:39:05.020
 on this, sort of bringing together the epilepsy technique

1:39:05.020 --> 1:39:07.220
 and the psychiatry expertise to study

1:39:07.220 --> 1:39:11.340
 how we could better target electrodes in depression,

1:39:11.340 --> 1:39:14.540
 and I'll tell you, if they have a consistent target,

1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:18.260
 perhaps there becomes an ultrasound target,

1:39:18.260 --> 1:39:21.220
 but right now, the approach is a bit more reversible

1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:23.380
 because you can always shut that electrode off

1:39:23.380 --> 1:39:25.340
 or even remove the electrode

1:39:25.340 --> 1:39:27.540
 if perhaps it's not in the optimal location

1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:28.740
 to treat the depression,

1:39:29.900 --> 1:39:32.980
 but actually, after a large volume of cases,

1:39:32.980 --> 1:39:35.660
 perhaps they could pool that data

1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:39.460
 to develop a new ultrasound target for depression.

1:39:39.460 --> 1:39:40.640
 I think that would be fabulous

1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:43.460
 and probably is their long-term goal,

1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:44.620
 not to speak for them,

1:39:44.620 --> 1:39:47.580
 but that would be something that I'm sure is on their radar,

1:39:47.580 --> 1:39:51.140
 and Baylor's trying to do the same thing for depression.

1:39:51.140 --> 1:39:52.740
 Their approaches are a little bit different,

1:39:52.740 --> 1:39:55.540
 but a similar tool to try to understand depression,

1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:59.740
 and we're working with all of these types of colleagues,

1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:00.700
 some of these are our friends,

1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:03.340
 to try to bring this to OCD as well,

1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:06.200
 and it makes sense to try to do this for addiction

1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:08.500
 and obesity and anorexia.

1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:10.000
 You might ask, well, why aren't you doing this

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000
 for obesity right now in our study,

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.460
 and the reason is that we've developed a target for obesity

1:40:17.460 --> 1:40:20.440
 and binge eating disorder developed out of mice

1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:23.780
 that we believe is relevant for the human state,

1:40:23.780 --> 1:40:26.340
 because you can model this problem in a mouse

1:40:26.340 --> 1:40:30.060
 a bit better than you can model depression or OCD,

1:40:30.060 --> 1:40:34.100
 so we feel like we can rely on the preclinical studies more,

1:40:34.100 --> 1:40:36.280
 whereas with these perhaps more,

1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:37.480
 I don't wanna say more complicated,

1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:39.940
 but more human mental health conditions

1:40:39.940 --> 1:40:42.700
 that are hard to model in a mouse,

1:40:42.700 --> 1:40:45.620
 you really have to study it in the human,

1:40:45.620 --> 1:40:47.660
 and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient,

1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:49.020
 a patient that has electrodes

1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:51.980
 that try to provoke a depressed state or study epileptics,

1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:53.540
 like Dr. Chang has done,

1:40:53.540 --> 1:40:56.420
 that have comorbid depression, for example,

1:40:56.420 --> 1:40:59.060
 and that can really validate this approach as well,

1:40:59.060 --> 1:41:01.400
 but in the end, it's getting into the human brain

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:04.700
 that we need to do in the disease specifically

1:41:05.580 --> 1:41:09.640
 that will eventually lead to a non-invasive approach,

1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:11.740
 either a lesion or a modulatory approach.

1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:13.220
 Modulatory would be like TMS,

1:41:13.220 --> 1:41:15.780
 or lesion approach would be with ultrasound.

1:41:15.780 --> 1:41:19.500
 I couldn't agree more.

1:41:19.500 --> 1:41:22.940
 Meanwhile, because there are many, many millions

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:25.900
 of people suffering from depression, eating disorders,

1:41:25.900 --> 1:41:29.760
 Parkinson's and essential tremor, et cetera.

1:41:30.900 --> 1:41:32.420
 Well, first of all, I should say,

1:41:32.420 --> 1:41:34.940
 based on everything you've told me thus far,

1:41:34.940 --> 1:41:39.440
 it's amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work

1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:41.380
 because of how systemic they are

1:41:41.380 --> 1:41:44.500
 and impacting serotonergic neurons over here

1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:45.980
 and dopaminergic neurons over there

1:41:45.980 --> 1:41:47.980
 and not targeting any specific batch of cells.

1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:49.000
 It makes perfect sense

1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.240
 as to why all the side effects exist.

1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:52.460
 But earlier you said something

1:41:52.460 --> 1:41:54.800
 that really grabbed my attention I want to come back to,

1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:59.060
 which is that if people can be made to feel

1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:02.340
 or make themselves feel just a little bit better,

1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:05.580
 a little less anxious just prior to a craving episode

1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:06.740
 or a binge episode,

1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:09.820
 maybe even if people can become better

1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:12.180
 at detecting their own internal states

1:42:12.180 --> 1:42:14.540
 and when they're kind of veering toward a binge

1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:16.340
 or veering toward using a drug

1:42:16.340 --> 1:42:20.780
 or maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking.

1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:23.820
 Based on what you said earlier,

1:42:23.820 --> 1:42:28.820
 that those kind of pre-behavioral states

1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:31.260
 kind of drift on the steering,

1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:37.400
 those sound like powerful levels of awareness,

1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:41.000
 at least for now until we have specific sites in the brain

1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:42.700
 that we can target non-invasive methods

1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:44.940
 that could be deployed to millions and millions of people.

1:42:44.940 --> 1:42:47.860
 Seems like that awareness seems like

1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:50.780
 maybe among the best tools that people could develop.

1:42:50.780 --> 1:42:52.340
 Yes, I 100% agree with you.

1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:55.020
 You know, so for the person with OCD

1:42:55.020 --> 1:42:58.140
 who suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder

1:42:58.140 --> 1:42:59.800
 and to their clinicians,

1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:01.660
 I just want to highlight that you said that.

1:43:01.660 --> 1:43:03.540
 I mean, again, I'm not a clinician.

1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:05.080
 I always say this, I don't prescribe anything.

1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:06.340
 I profess things.

1:43:06.340 --> 1:43:11.340
 But awareness of one's thinking

1:43:11.860 --> 1:43:14.580
 seems immensely powerful in this context.

1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:20.540
 And after all, it is the clinical probe that you use

1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:23.180
 because let's say the patient were to lie to you

1:43:23.180 --> 1:43:27.340
 about their experience of what happens in their mind

1:43:27.340 --> 1:43:30.080
 when you stimulate, you could basically,

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:31.740
 the whole thing, the whole surgery,

1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:34.580
 the whole procedure could go badly wrong.

1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:37.100
 So it's up to the patient to be, of course,

1:43:37.100 --> 1:43:40.100
 honest with you and they're incentivized to do that.

1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:42.940
 But to be honest with themselves about,

1:43:42.940 --> 1:43:45.780
 ah, you know, I've gone all day without a binge,

1:43:45.780 --> 1:43:48.460
 but you know, the smell of a donut

1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:49.420
 or the thought of a donut

1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:51.660
 is starting to have a particular allure.

1:43:51.660 --> 1:43:54.500
 That awareness seems like an incredibly powerful thing

1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:57.060
 to own and to build and cultivate.

1:43:57.060 --> 1:44:00.300
 Yes, I've always thought that if we could improve awareness,

1:44:00.300 --> 1:44:01.780
 we can improve outcomes.

1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:04.540
 I think that's probably true for many of these patients.

1:44:04.540 --> 1:44:06.740
 The problem I think comes down to the fact

1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:10.620
 that some of these patients are so resistant to treatment.

1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:14.180
 And the patients that we see as a surgeon, for example,

1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:16.460
 are the patients that they've tried

1:44:16.460 --> 1:44:18.140
 cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:19.420
 certainly they've tried medications,

1:44:19.420 --> 1:44:21.580
 they've tried behavioral management.

1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:23.860
 They are aware of their problem

1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:24.900
 and they've shown that to us.

1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:27.460
 They can tell us when they're craving,

1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:29.760
 but despite the craving and despite being involved

1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:32.500
 in this invasive brain surgical trial,

1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:36.140
 highly, you know, first in human novel study,

1:44:36.980 --> 1:44:38.480
 which I think will have a positive effect,

1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:40.020
 but it's still experimental.

1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:42.780
 They still can't stop themselves.

1:44:42.780 --> 1:44:47.700
 So they're sort of as made aware as could possibly be.

1:44:47.700 --> 1:44:49.220
 Did I use grammar there correctly?

1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:50.060
 I think so.

1:44:51.260 --> 1:44:53.700
 They're as aware as they could possibly be

1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:55.860
 and they still lose control.

1:44:55.860 --> 1:44:57.840
 We've had this studied in the lab.

1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:59.820
 So we will bring patients to the laboratory

1:44:59.820 --> 1:45:03.700
 with this implanted device to try to provoke

1:45:03.700 --> 1:45:05.780
 this electrographic electrical signal

1:45:06.860 --> 1:45:08.820
 that can be detected by the actual device

1:45:08.820 --> 1:45:11.920
 that will stimulate them when they're at home.

1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:13.700
 But before we actually initiate stimulation,

1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:16.180
 we want to see can this device detect

1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:19.300
 this craving cell signal,

1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:20.140
 which is gonna be different

1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:21.020
 than what we saw in the operating room

1:45:21.020 --> 1:45:22.180
 because that's a single cell,

1:45:22.180 --> 1:45:23.980
 but these devices, these electrodes

1:45:23.980 --> 1:45:25.460
 are about a millimeter in diameter

1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:27.500
 instead of like a 10th of a millimeter,

1:45:27.500 --> 1:45:30.300
 which is what we use in the operating room.

1:45:30.300 --> 1:45:33.220
 So they're only hearing or detecting,

1:45:33.220 --> 1:45:36.540
 I should say, thousands of cells' responses.

1:45:36.540 --> 1:45:41.540
 And we actually have a way to provoke binges.

1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:43.420
 It's called a mood provocation.

1:45:43.420 --> 1:45:46.060
 It's very well validated.

1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:47.660
 It's a little bit like provoking seizures

1:45:47.660 --> 1:45:48.980
 in the epilepsy monitoring unit,

1:45:48.980 --> 1:45:53.540
 but here in the sort of psychiatric monitoring unit

1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:55.360
 or the food monitoring unit,

1:45:55.360 --> 1:45:58.360
 we actually have a psychiatrist

1:45:58.360 --> 1:45:59.680
 and each sort of specialist come

1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.760
 and induce a mood that is related

1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:08.760
 to each patient's sort of self-described binge episode.

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:10.760
 So the psychiatrist comes in

1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:15.640
 and provokes a feeling that can evoke

1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:17.440
 the negative behavior.

1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:18.280
 That's exactly right.

1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:21.200
 So that we can video and synchronize the video

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:23.480
 to the brain signal recordings.

1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:25.840
 The patients all wear an eye tracker

1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:28.200
 so we can see what they're eating at all times

1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:30.380
 and what they're looking at specifically.

1:46:30.380 --> 1:46:33.800
 And that allows us to have

1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:36.380
 the best temporal resolution possible

1:46:36.380 --> 1:46:39.960
 to understand what is happening right before the bite.

1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:41.680
 And even under video surveillance

1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:45.900
 through a one-way mirror in a laboratory setting

1:46:45.900 --> 1:46:48.480
 when patients are very well aware

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:50.780
 that they're there to be studied

1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:53.040
 if they're going to binge,

1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:54.400
 they still do.

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:57.560
 And we believe they do because they just can't control it

1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:00.360
 as aware as they are of it.

1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:03.000
 And it's probably because they're the most severe.

1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.760
 So I think if we can improve awareness,

1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:07.140
 not just the societal awareness

1:47:07.140 --> 1:47:08.120
 that I was talking about earlier,

1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:11.400
 but the patient awareness around their problem,

1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:13.120
 I think that could be a powerful way

1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:14.520
 to help so many of these patients.

1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:18.120
 And that's sort of the role of cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:19.760
 The problem with cognitive behavioral therapy

1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:21.160
 or I should say the limitation of it,

1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:22.520
 I actually don't have any problem with it.

1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:24.320
 I think it's a wonderful treatment,

1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:27.580
 is that if you stop it,

1:47:27.580 --> 1:47:30.760
 many of these patients go back to their old behaviors.

1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:31.760
 I don't want to say old habits,

1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:34.560
 but it might be a habit, but the old behaviors.

1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:37.920
 And so that's the problem is that it's not necessarily

1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:39.720
 lasting in the absence of continued

1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:40.680
 cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:43.520
 Some people can benefit from it long-term, but some can't.

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:48.400
 But I think in the less severe patients,

1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:50.200
 improving awareness, key.

1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:51.720
 But in these really refractory patients,

1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:54.240
 this is kind of like, this is the disease.

1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:56.960
 Despite the awareness, they can't control themselves.

1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.400
 And that's what we're trying to restore

1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:01.840
 is that improved ability to control their behavior.

1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:03.880
 Do you think there's a role for machines

1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:06.360
 and artificial intelligence here?

1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:08.400
 There are a couple laboratories up

1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:10.040
 at the University of Washington

1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:15.040
 that are using particular signature patterns

1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:20.400
 within voice to try and help suicidal,

1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:23.040
 people who are suicidally depressed,

1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:24.800
 know when they're headed towards an episode

1:48:24.800 --> 1:48:26.720
 before they even can consciously know.

1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:28.240
 So this gets right down to issues of free will

1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:30.360
 and whether or not machines can be smarter than we are.

1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:33.400
 But one could argue that some of the search algorithms

1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:35.040
 on Google and other search engines

1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:37.940
 are actually more aware of our preferences than we are.

1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:40.840
 Basically what these are,

1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:43.400
 these are devices that are listening to people talk all day.

1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:45.440
 They're also paying attention to patterns of breathing

1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:46.840
 and how well people slept, et cetera.

1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:49.560
 Integrating a huge number of cues

1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:53.200
 and then signaling somebody with a yellow light,

1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:55.280
 like you're headed into a depressive episode

1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:56.120
 and the person might say,

1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:58.060
 oh, I feel fine or I feel pretty good.

1:48:58.060 --> 1:48:59.880
 This is kind of baseline state for me.

1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:01.080
 And they say, ah, ah.

1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:04.980
 This is where you were preceding the last episode

1:49:04.980 --> 1:49:06.560
 that took you down a deep, dark trench

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:09.000
 and it took months to get out of.

1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.320
 I wonder whether or not some of these devices

1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.160
 could help with the sorts of things

1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:14.400
 that we're talking about today.

1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:16.700
 Yeah, I think so.

1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:19.040
 I've always said we have to get in the brain

1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:20.280
 before we get out of it.

1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:21.380
 And if we get in the brain

1:49:21.380 --> 1:49:23.720
 and understand what these signals look like,

1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:26.520
 we'll know what those non-invasive signals are.

1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.120
 I think it's possible

1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:32.520
 that we are scientifically sophisticated enough

1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:35.480
 to use machine learning

1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:39.120
 and sort of this kind of bot technique

1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:43.040
 to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive.

1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:44.560
 Suicide is the most dangerous impulse.

1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:49.560
 It's something that is immensely a focus of the lab

1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:50.880
 is impulsivity.

1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:53.120
 We've talked mostly about compulsion.

1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:56.320
 Compulsion being going after a reward

1:49:56.320 --> 1:49:58.320
 or the urge despite the risk.

1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:01.520
 Impulsivity is similar but different.

1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:05.640
 It's kind of going after something a little bit.

1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:08.240
 If you model impulsivity in a mouse,

1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:13.240
 it's related to going after a food reward

1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:16.200
 without the sort of paired tone

1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:18.200
 that the mouse is supposed to wait for.

1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:19.400
 The mouse doesn't want to wait anymore.

1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:21.440
 They just go after the food.

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:22.360
 I've been that mouse.

1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:24.520
 Yeah, we all have been.

1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:26.920
 We can all relate with this to a certain extent.

1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:28.120
 Again, it's the spectrum.

1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:33.140
 So in any case, non sequitur.

1:50:33.140 --> 1:50:36.960
 But I certainly think that there is a way

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:40.640
 to use our own body's physiology

1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:45.360
 to anticipate when these impulses are coming online.

1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:46.940
 How best to do that?

1:50:46.940 --> 1:50:48.640
 I think we're just scratching the surface

1:50:48.640 --> 1:50:52.720
 but these are the kinds of solutions we need.

1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:55.480
 These are, some of these problems

1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:57.440
 are of epidemic proportions.

1:50:57.440 --> 1:50:59.680
 Largest public health problems in this country,

1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:00.520
 in this world.

1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:03.760
 Obesity, opiate crisis, depression, suicidality.

1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:06.680
 I mean, that's like a third of our country, maybe more.

1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:08.800
 Probably more if you think about it.

1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:10.720
 And a colleague of ours at Stanford Psychiatry

1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:13.180
 told me something that still just blows my mind

1:51:13.180 --> 1:51:18.180
 which is that something like 75% of the antidepressant

1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:21.480
 and anti-anxiety medication that exists in the world

1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:23.480
 is consumed in the United States.

1:51:23.480 --> 1:51:24.320
 It's amazing.

1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:26.500
 Which is, I mean, that's an outrageous number.

1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:29.640
 Yeah, we do have an obsession in this country for pharmacy.

1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:32.880
 And the pharmaceutical industry is very powerful here

1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:35.720
 and probably related to some aspect of capitalism.

1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:38.600
 I'm capitalistic and just like everybody else.

1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:41.120
 But I do worry about that a little bit.

1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:44.700
 But we tend to over-prescribe

1:51:44.700 --> 1:51:49.600
 and I think we as patients tend to over-want medication.

1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:50.900
 We like quick solutions

1:51:50.900 --> 1:51:53.000
 and sometimes medications provide it, sometimes not.

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.400
 Or they're often just a band-aid.

1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:56.200
 It depends on the problem, of course.

1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:02.680
 But I agree that we need scalable solutions.

1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:03.840
 I'm a neurosurgeon.

1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:07.040
 I'm only gonna be able to treat the most severe of patients

1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:08.440
 with these problems.

1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:12.200
 You know, we've only done about 200,000

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:15.440
 deep brain stimulation surgeries ever.

1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.220
 So, I mean, the problem we're talking about here

1:52:18.220 --> 1:52:20.880
 is 50 million Americans.

1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:23.000
 There's no possibility that surgeons

1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:24.560
 can address that problem.

1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:28.040
 But we could help inspire an initiative

1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:29.480
 to go after that kind of problem

1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:31.320
 or help make it more rigorous.

1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:32.640
 Because the last thing we need

1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.560
 is some sort of wearable fancy tool

1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:40.460
 that wastes people's money and time.

1:52:40.460 --> 1:52:42.200
 We need real therapies for these things.

1:52:42.200 --> 1:52:44.800
 Not that these devices that we're discussing are not.

1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:47.000
 I think actually there's lots of promise.

1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.960
 We use machine learning in the lab all the time.

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:51.520
 I'm not an electrical engineer

1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:52.960
 or the computational neuroscientist

1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:54.080
 doing this type of work.

1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:56.360
 I just help develop the hypotheses around it

1:52:56.360 --> 1:52:58.360
 and help fundraise around it.

1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:01.600
 But I definitely think there's a future for it.

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:05.360
 I suspect we're scratching the surface on how best to do it.

1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:07.100
 Let's talk about your hands.

1:53:07.100 --> 1:53:08.460
 Yeah, sure.

1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:09.880
 All the neurosurgeons I know

1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:13.520
 are very faithfully protect their hands.

1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:14.360
 And let's talk about-

1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:16.080
 It's because hand insurance is too expensive.

1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:17.680
 That's right.

1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:20.720
 But I'm guessing that you all are not the ones

1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:23.040
 to reach into the garbage disposal

1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:24.520
 even if your eye is on the switch

1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:26.440
 to make sure that it isn't going to get turned on.

1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:27.360
 They're just too precious.

1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:28.640
 They are your livelihood.

1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:31.920
 And earlier we talked about deadlifts.

1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:34.240
 There are other forms of exercise.

1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:35.960
 There are things like tennis.

1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:38.880
 They're drawing and painting a full range of things

1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:40.040
 that one can do with their hands.

1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:41.240
 Use your imagination, folks.

1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:42.800
 Sure.

1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:44.960
 Is it true that neurosurgeons

1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:49.400
 don't do any really heavy grip activity

1:53:49.400 --> 1:53:54.300
 because it can refine the motor circuits

1:53:54.300 --> 1:53:55.920
 in the brain and elsewhere

1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:59.640
 that can throw off their neurosurgery game?

1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:04.640
 I would say that many neurosurgeons avoid activities

1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:07.960
 that put their hands at risk.

1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:09.160
 Another one, by the way,

1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:13.080
 there's an annual softball tournament

1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:17.160
 that neurosurgeons come to in New York City

1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:19.220
 in Central Park and play. With a very softball.

1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:20.060
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:54:20.060 --> 1:54:24.360
 Well, actually it's actually a very typical hard softball.

1:54:24.360 --> 1:54:25.800
 I don't know why they call it softball.

1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:29.120
 And actually two close colleagues of mine

1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:31.600
 have gotten injured at that tournament.

1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:34.280
 It's also, I must say, and here I'm poking fun,

1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:35.280
 but for those of you who are going

1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:36.420
 to the medical profession,

1:54:36.420 --> 1:54:39.400
 it's also one of the more, how should I say this?

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.680
 Well, I'm just going to say it.

1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:44.560
 There's a steep hierarchy of training in neurosurgery.

1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:47.180
 There's a certain harshness that's been conveyed to me

1:54:47.180 --> 1:54:50.180
 about the training, much like astronaut training,

1:54:50.180 --> 1:54:51.560
 to be totally fair.

1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:54.740
 And so maybe this is a tactic to weed out

1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:57.720
 either the younger or the older generation.

1:54:57.720 --> 1:54:58.760
 This is evolution, right?

1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:03.000
 We have to evolve and weed out the weak, I guess.

1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000
 Well, I could say that one of the individuals

1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.120
 that got injured is one of the more senior surgeons

1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.780
 that I work with now and is one of the best athletes

1:55:09.780 --> 1:55:11.560
 that I know and he's definitely not weak.

1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:13.720
 But you can get injured playing these sports.

1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:16.840
 And that being said, I can tell you briefly

1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:21.720
 is I think that, it's funny, my mother came to me recently.

1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:25.480
 She has osteopenia and she told me, her doctor told her,

1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:26.760
 she's not allowed to do deadlifts.

1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:30.480
 And I was like, okay, that's fine.

1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:31.960
 I'm not telling you you should do deadlifts.

1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:34.480
 I just don't exactly understand the relationship.

1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:39.200
 But I can say that I do think,

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:40.800
 I'll give you a little story here.

1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:43.500
 The reason why I'm being a little hesitant to confirm

1:55:43.500 --> 1:55:45.560
 that I agree with you on the deadlifts is

1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:48.320
 when I was operating,

1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:50.840
 this was when I was at Stanford University operating.

1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:53.320
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:55:53.320 --> 1:55:55.000
 we get an intraoperative CAT scan

1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:56.200
 to confirm accuracy of our lectures.

1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:57.960
 I do this for all of my surgeries.

1:55:57.960 --> 1:55:59.520
 When I was reviewing that CAT scan,

1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:02.640
 the X-ray technician looked at me and said,

1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:04.080
 whispered into my ear, he's like,

1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:06.880
 your posture is really bad.

1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:08.080
 It's embarrassing.

1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:10.000
 Your physical posture while doing your surgeries.

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.000
 Yeah.

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.880
 And I looked at him and I kind of wanted to say,

1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:15.440
 I won't curse, but I, yeah, exactly.

1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:17.640
 I've been doing it intermittently during our conversation

1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:19.040
 because he made me realize

1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:20.840
 that I really did have bad posture.

1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:23.840
 And we kind of had a little brief aside

1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:26.160
 and I learned he was a personal trainer.

1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:27.880
 And his name was Zach.

1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:32.200
 And he said to me, your posture is weak because,

1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:34.320
 or your posture is poor because you're weak.

1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:37.800
 You need to strengthen your body and strengthen your core.

1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:39.200
 I was like, how?

1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:41.560
 He's like, powerlifting.

1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:43.840
 And I'm like, I'm a little hesitant to do this.

1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:46.160
 And I'll tell you, I started very slowly

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:48.080
 and I can't prescribe powerlifting to everybody

1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:49.400
 for the exact reason you said.

1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:52.400
 And I've gotten hurt doing it, by the way.

1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:56.560
 But I do think, I wish I started a little younger.

1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:59.960
 And I would argue that with close supervision

1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:04.960
 and very well, if you have a very experienced trainer,

1:57:06.160 --> 1:57:09.200
 which I would argue if you're a neurosurgeon or an astronaut

1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:11.280
 or have a highly specialized profession

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:15.120
 where you need your limbs to function,

1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:17.200
 dentists, things like that.

1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:18.440
 If you're gonna take something on like this,

1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:21.040
 it really needs to be extremely carefully supervised.

1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:24.320
 And I can tell you that my trainer had a profound impact

1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:27.680
 on my life and my posture and my physical health.

1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:30.840
 And so we did deadlift, I'll admit.

1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:33.160
 So when you brought it up, I kind of chuckled to myself.

1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:37.120
 But yes, I have gotten mildly hurt deadlifting,

1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:38.480
 but it was when I was doing it by myself

1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:41.120
 and I was kind of cocky and I wasn't paying attention.

1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:45.200
 But when I was with him and he was all over my technique,

1:57:45.200 --> 1:57:46.760
 it actually was the most efficient way

1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:48.320
 for me to feel stronger.

1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:51.640
 And it improved my posture significantly.

1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:54.080
 And I miss him since I've left California.

1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:56.440
 I have a new trainer in Philadelphia who's great,

1:57:57.840 --> 1:57:59.520
 and I still deadlift occasionally with him.

1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:04.440
 But I can say I am opposed to deadlifting callously.

1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:07.600
 But if you're extremely well monitored

1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:11.520
 by an experienced personal trainer or weightlifter,

1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:13.520
 I think it could be a great exercise.

1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:16.520
 Great, I'd love to be wrong in this case

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:18.640
 because I'm a huge proponent.

1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:20.080
 And now on the podcast, I go on and on.

1:58:20.080 --> 1:58:23.200
 I mean, there's so much data now pointing to the fact

1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:27.880
 that 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio

1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:30.200
 kind of jogging, cycling, swimming type behavior

1:58:30.200 --> 1:58:31.720
 is very healthy for everybody.

1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:33.680
 And we should all be doing that, at least that.

1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:34.920
 Yes, I need to as well.

1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:38.520
 And that resistance training on the order of, you know,

1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:40.640
 six hard sets per muscle group per week

1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:43.520
 is really important just to offset deterioration of muscles.

1:58:43.520 --> 1:58:44.360
 And-

1:58:44.360 --> 1:58:45.180
 I'm learning as we go here.

1:58:45.180 --> 1:58:47.080
 All function and tendon strength,

1:58:47.080 --> 1:58:48.540
 and that's just to maintain.

1:58:48.540 --> 1:58:51.000
 We're not talking about all outsets to absolute failure,

1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:53.880
 but as you point out with proper form.

1:58:53.880 --> 1:58:56.920
 So even the neurosurgeons are doing this,

1:58:56.920 --> 1:58:58.760
 which I think is wonderful.

1:58:58.760 --> 1:58:59.600
 Yes.

1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:04.600
 As a final question, but one that I think really,

1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:06.800
 or maybe second to final question,

1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:10.080
 earlier I commented on the remarkable calm,

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:13.600
 at least perceived calm of neurosurgeons.

1:59:13.600 --> 1:59:16.720
 It could be cause or it could be effect of the training,

1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:20.920
 but it's obvious to me why one would want that trait

1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:22.340
 in their neurosurgeon.

1:59:23.400 --> 1:59:25.040
 I wouldn't want a hyperactive,

1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:26.920
 certainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon,

1:59:26.920 --> 1:59:30.960
 given that the margins of error are so, so tiny

1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:33.560
 spatial scale and probably on the temporal scale too.

1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:34.400
 Yes.

1:59:34.400 --> 1:59:35.880
 You don't want people doing things in time

1:59:35.880 --> 1:59:38.320
 that are, you know, or being spontaneous at all.

1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:43.040
 Do you think that this branch of medicine that you're in

1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:47.720
 selects for people that at least can know how to control

1:59:47.720 --> 1:59:50.040
 any kind of fluctuations in autonomic arousal,

1:59:50.040 --> 1:59:52.040
 they can calm themselves in real time?

1:59:52.040 --> 1:59:53.900
 And here's a specific question.

1:59:53.900 --> 1:59:55.700
 I've never operated on the human brain,

1:59:55.700 --> 1:59:57.080
 although I've had the privilege of being

1:59:57.080 --> 1:59:58.680
 in the operating room and seeing this

1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:01.240
 with some of our experiments with people in VR.

2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:02.800
 It's a remarkable thing.

2:00:02.800 --> 2:00:04.820
 I wish for everybody that would get this experience

2:00:04.820 --> 2:00:06.720
 at some point, not hopefully as a patient,

2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:09.240
 unless they have a need, but to observe it.

2:00:09.240 --> 2:00:14.240
 But what was just striking to me is the various

2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:17.920
 stereotype behaviors of the surgeon.

2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:19.920
 And when I did surgeries as a graduate student,

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:22.600
 as a postdoc in the brains of other types of animals,

2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:23.440
 I would find, for instance,

2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:24.880
 that if I started to tremble a little bit,

2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:28.760
 if I tapped my left foot, that my hand would stabilize a bit

2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:30.560
 that there's this kind of need to move the body

2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:31.560
 or one feels the impulse.

2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:35.200
 Maybe that's my Tourette's-like compulsions again,

2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:39.600
 but that one can kind of siphon off some of that energy

2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:42.640
 into another limb so that you could remain precise.

2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:46.100
 So are these sorts of things that I'm talking about,

2:00:46.100 --> 2:00:47.920
 maybe it's entirely my imagination,

2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:50.340
 but are these the sorts of things that one learns

2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:54.180
 as a neurosurgeon how to still the body and still the mind?

2:00:54.180 --> 2:00:55.760
 Do you have a meditative practice?

2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:57.520
 When you go into the operating room,

2:00:57.520 --> 2:00:59.780
 if you had a particularly challenging morning

2:00:59.780 --> 2:01:01.600
 or a poor night's sleep,

2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:04.760
 do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself

2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:06.720
 and get yourself into the zone?

2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:08.640
 I think this would be very interesting for people

2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:09.940
 to get some insight into,

2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:11.760
 even if they don't want to be a neurosurgeon.

2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:13.220
 Yeah, I completely agree.

2:01:13.220 --> 2:01:17.300
 And I appreciate the earlier reference to neurosurgeons

2:01:17.300 --> 2:01:20.720
 as astronauts, because I've also heard us

2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:22.020
 compared to cowboys before,

2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:23.920
 and it's a little bit less flattering.

2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:30.440
 Some of what we do surgically really does require

2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:32.200
 a substantial amount of confidence.

2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:37.040
 And that confidence hopefully comes from years

2:01:37.040 --> 2:01:39.060
 of training and experience.

2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:43.680
 You always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced,

2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:45.600
 and that is problematic.

2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:47.580
 Luckily, you so rarely see that,

2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:50.240
 because our training is so rigorous.

2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:53.080
 We have a board of,

2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:54.680
 American Board of Neurological Surgeons

2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:59.680
 that sort of allows and assesses surgeons

2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:03.860
 to continue practice and holds us to a really high bar.

2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.360
 I do think it tends to attract a certain personality.

2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:12.520
 In my subspecialty, as a deep brain stimulation surgeon,

2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:15.320
 we call it stereotactic and functional neurosurgery.

2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:16.480
 Some people have likened us

2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:19.400
 to the neurologists with a scalpel.

2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:21.360
 We tend to be a bit more intellectual.

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:27.360
 Maybe bedside manner is a little bit friendlier.

2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:29.320
 And then there's the vascular neurosurgeon

2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:31.720
 who doesn't sleep, and so they're not as friendly.

2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:34.560
 There's the spine surgeons who operate the most,

2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:36.960
 and so they're busy, busy, busy.

2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:40.120
 There are some of these kind of reputations going around.

2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:41.120
 But I agree with you.

2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:44.320
 There is sort of a common feature of a calmness

2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:45.760
 across neurosurgeons.

2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:48.480
 And there's some of my, obviously my favorite people,

2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:49.560
 my closest friends.

2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.680
 And I can relate with them probably because of that.

2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:56.200
 Sort of a big picture.

2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:00.240
 They don't get sort of flustered.

2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:04.440
 They tend to be really good

2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.800
 at figuring out how to have quality time

2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:08.040
 because we work really hard.

2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:10.480
 Our hours are significant.

2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:13.600
 And so the time with our families, our friends,

2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:15.880
 is less than we would like it to be.

2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:18.800
 Obviously, that's true for people who work hard

2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:19.840
 across any profession,

2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:21.880
 but definitely true for neurosurgeons.

2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:23.960
 And I think that we're very good at figuring out

2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:26.640
 how to make that time high quality.

2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:30.400
 You know, even just texting with some of my friends

2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:31.600
 that are neurosurgeons,

2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:34.000
 a great friend of mine just became chairman at Duke,

2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:38.160
 and just connecting with him by text, which takes seconds,

2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:40.280
 you know, we feel connected, you know?

2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:43.520
 And I think that's a trait amongst neurosurgeons.

2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:46.000
 We sort of know how to cut to the chase in a way

2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.200
 and prioritize our time.

2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:51.720
 It's a skill that we probably have innately,

2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:53.160
 but it's also part of the training.

2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:55.200
 You know, when we are interns now,

2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:57.360
 there's a lot of work hour regulations

2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:00.000
 that is probably quite appropriate, by the way.

2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:05.000
 I think our hours before were bordering on not necessarily,

2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.760
 let's just say they were not ideal

2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:10.920
 for mental health and sleep,

2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:13.480
 which we know are very important components.

2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:15.320
 Certainly, we had no time for meditation.

2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:16.320
 I definitely did not.

2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:17.400
 I wish I did.

2:04:18.840 --> 2:04:21.120
 Now, knowing what I know about meditation,

2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:22.120
 my wife's a health coach.

2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:26.520
 I get it, I see it, I practice it myself with her.

2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:28.280
 I see the value.

2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:30.320
 I wish I had that tool when I was in training

2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:31.560
 because it's stressful.

2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:34.720
 Even with the work hour restrictions,

2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:35.840
 we still don't sleep very much.

2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:39.280
 We're still at work a lot, about 80 hours a week.

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:41.480
 Throughout the entire career?

2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:42.760
 There are times when it's more,

2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:46.920
 because after training, there's no work hour restrictions.

2:04:46.920 --> 2:04:50.680
 So sometimes I feel like as faculty, we get abused,

2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:53.040
 and the trainees are a little bit more protected now.

2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:55.120
 It definitely was the reverse at one point.

2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:58.160
 That's also a huge problem, probably more of a problem.

2:04:58.160 --> 2:04:59.080
 And I'm joking a little bit.

2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:00.760
 I don't necessarily think we're abused,

2:05:00.760 --> 2:05:03.480
 but certainly our hours are significant.

2:05:04.880 --> 2:05:08.480
 But they come a bit more here and there.

2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:11.320
 On my OR days when I'm operating, those are long days,

2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:15.360
 but on the days that I'm lucky enough to be a researcher,

2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:17.520
 like you, those days tend to be a bit gentler

2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:18.440
 unless I'm grant writing.

2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:20.440
 Those days can be long, as you know.

2:05:20.440 --> 2:05:23.920
 So to answer your question,

2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:26.080
 I do think we're sort of self-selected for it,

2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:27.560
 but I also think it's part of the training.

2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:29.600
 You know, because of the long hours

2:05:29.600 --> 2:05:30.760
 that we're in the hospital,

2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:32.680
 we're taking care of sick patients,

2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:36.800
 and we have sort of a type A mentor approach

2:05:36.800 --> 2:05:39.080
 where our mentors are hard on us.

2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:41.480
 You know, we learn to cope with our stress

2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:44.840
 and be efficient and prioritize things

2:05:44.840 --> 2:05:47.400
 despite the stress of it all.

2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:51.720
 And I think we take from that this sort of calm demeanor,

2:05:51.720 --> 2:05:56.720
 and perhaps it just amplifies what we're probably drawn to,

2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:59.520
 because before we come to neurosurgery,

2:05:59.520 --> 2:06:01.240
 we might rotate in neurosurgery.

2:06:01.240 --> 2:06:05.200
 We might spend a month pretending to be a neurosurgeon,

2:06:05.200 --> 2:06:08.200
 learning from residents and faculty

2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:10.040
 that are practicing the specialty.

2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:13.280
 But prior to actually starting your training,

2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:14.840
 you never experience anything

2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:17.760
 like being a resident in neurosurgery.

2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:20.360
 The stress and the volume of patients

2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:23.000
 that you have to take care of and the long nights.

2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:25.280
 It can be quite lonely, by the way.

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:26.720
 You develop friends in the hospital,

2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:29.440
 but sometimes you're on your own when you're on call,

2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:30.280
 and you have backup.

2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:32.840
 You can call your chief resident or your attending,

2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:33.800
 but you really have to learn

2:06:33.800 --> 2:06:35.920
 how to take care of patients yourself.

2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:38.360
 You obviously form teams with nurses and staff

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:39.880
 and things like that and other residents,

2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:41.320
 but it can be lonely.

2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:42.760
 It can be really challenging.

2:06:42.760 --> 2:06:45.200
 And I think because of those experiences

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:47.280
 that all neurosurgeons go through,

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:54.720
 we tend to have this sort of unflappable personality

2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.720
 that perhaps we started with a bit

2:06:56.720 --> 2:06:58.800
 compared to the average person,

2:06:58.800 --> 2:07:01.120
 but the training definitely amplifies it.

2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:04.600
 And do you have tools that you implement

2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:07.760
 if you ever feel that you're getting slightly off-center?

2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:08.680
 I do now.

2:07:08.680 --> 2:07:13.680
 You know, when I was in training,

2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:17.880
 I actually remember in my second year,

2:07:17.880 --> 2:07:20.320
 so most neurosurgery programs,

2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:21.840
 when you're a junior resident,

2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:24.800
 in some ways that's your toughest year, not in every way.

2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:29.040
 It is your toughest year because you're young

2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:30.120
 and you're inexperienced

2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:32.400
 and you don't know what you don't know.

2:07:32.400 --> 2:07:34.200
 And that's why it's such a tough year

2:07:34.200 --> 2:07:36.280
 because you have to learn a lot very quickly

2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:39.600
 for patient safety reasons, for self-survival.

2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:41.400
 You know, you just have to learn a lot

2:07:42.360 --> 2:07:44.640
 and you're on call by yourself in the hospital.

2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:46.760
 And it's a real challenge.

2:07:46.760 --> 2:07:48.760
 And I think that, you know,

2:07:48.760 --> 2:07:51.280
 personally, I gained a lot of weight during that year.

2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:54.560
 The only exercise I did consciously was taking the stairs.

2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:56.160
 I refused to take the elevator.

2:07:56.160 --> 2:08:00.240
 And I was at Penn, at HUP, where I currently practice now.

2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:02.400
 And I remember I would see patients

2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:04.200
 anywhere from sort of the ground floor

2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:06.200
 where the trauma bay was or the ER,

2:08:06.200 --> 2:08:08.320
 all the way up to Founders 12, the 12th floor.

2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:09.720
 And I would never take an elevator.

2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:10.880
 That was my rule for the year

2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:13.400
 because I knew I would not have time to exercise,

2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:14.720
 but I would just take the stairs.

2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:15.960
 And in the beginning of the year,

2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:18.520
 I would be a little winded when I got to the 12th floor.

2:08:18.520 --> 2:08:19.960
 But by the end of the year, actually,

2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:20.800
 it didn't really faze me

2:08:20.800 --> 2:08:22.840
 and it became a great habit to have.

2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:25.160
 The problem with that, though,

2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:27.000
 is I paired that, unfortunately,

2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:29.320
 with a lot of sleepless nights,

2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:31.440
 or not enough sleep, let's say.

2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:33.800
 And I had this terrible habit

2:08:33.800 --> 2:08:36.640
 of drinking coffee late at night

2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:38.160
 and I would put a lot of sugar in it.

2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:41.280
 And it was sort of the only way for me to get a quick,

2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:43.800
 you know, a quick bout of energy

2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:46.600
 that for some reason I prioritized at that time,

2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:49.000
 obviously knowing that I would crash, which I always did.

2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.320
 And I always kind of regretted it, but I still did it anyway.

2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:55.120
 And I attribute that to poor decision-making,

2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:59.160
 inexperience, and perhaps being a little vulnerable,

2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:00.160
 like I think we all are.

2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:02.960
 That's why I relate with a lot of the research that I do.

2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:05.400
 And I remember I got married in my third year,

2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:07.000
 the year after my second year.

2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.600
 And my wife and I, or my fiance at the time,

2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:11.880
 we started going to the gym together in the morning

2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:13.720
 and my hours were a little better.

2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:15.200
 So I would actually be able to exercise

2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:16.880
 before I operated that day.

2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:19.440
 And I operated almost every day as a third year resident.

2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:21.120
 So I remember I'd get to the gym really early.

2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:23.240
 And in three months I lost like 20 pounds

2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:24.360
 and I wasn't trying to lose weight.

2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:27.320
 I just was sleeping better and taking care of myself.

2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:28.880
 And I remember when we got married,

2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:32.680
 I fit into a tuxedo that I had in college

2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:33.720
 or it would have fit me in college.

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:35.240
 It actually was a new tuxedo admittedly,

2:09:35.240 --> 2:09:37.440
 but it was the same size as my tuxedo from college.

2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:41.360
 So I think that I've always related with the problems

2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:43.840
 that our patients have to a certain extent.

2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:47.200
 And when I've been most vulnerable,

2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:49.200
 which is when I was working the hardest

2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:51.800
 with the least amount of sleep, I related with it the most.

2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:55.720
 And yes, exercise for me has always been my tool.

2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:00.860
 More recently, exercise, some strength training,

2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:03.600
 I think is important, paired with cardio.

2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:06.560
 I don't do enough of either, but I definitely do some.

2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:07.840
 And that helps.

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:09.200
 Meditation helps me a bit.

2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:11.300
 I do that every night before I go to sleep.

2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:14.320
 I use an app for it.

2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:16.480
 It's probably not the best way to do meditation, but-

2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:17.840
 If it keeps you doing it regularly,

2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:19.440
 it's the best way to do it.

2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:21.040
 Andrew, I couldn't agree with you more.

2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:21.880
 It's one of those things

2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:23.340
 where I look forward to it every night.

2:10:23.340 --> 2:10:26.880
 And sometimes my wife falls asleep

2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:28.880
 and I come to bed a little later and I whisper,

2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:30.580
 I'm like, are you okay if I turn the app on?

2:10:30.580 --> 2:10:32.560
 So, you know, and she does the same to me

2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:33.960
 because I think we both value it.

2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:35.720
 And I think that's been very helpful.

2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:38.960
 And I didn't have that tool probably when I needed it most,

2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:41.720
 but I have it now and it's very helpful.

2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:44.360
 I really appreciate you sharing those tools.

2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:46.840
 A number of people, I'm guessing out there,

2:10:46.840 --> 2:10:48.240
 might want to become neurosurgeons.

2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.880
 I really believe that in hearing today's conversation

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:53.360
 that you will spark an interest in medicine

2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:54.560
 and or neurosurgery.

2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:55.520
 I hope so.

2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:57.660
 Well, certainly you need to be a physician

2:10:57.660 --> 2:10:58.840
 before you can become a neurosurgeon.

2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:00.840
 So end neurosurgery in some cases,

2:11:00.840 --> 2:11:02.120
 and that would be beautiful.

2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:04.640
 And I predict that will happen, excuse me,

2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:07.960
 as a consequence of what you've shared today.

2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:10.560
 I really appreciate your mentioning

2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:15.560
 of the emphasis and appreciation on quality time.

2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:17.720
 I very much see this as quality time.

2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:20.700
 I know that our listeners will as well.

2:11:20.700 --> 2:11:22.640
 Really want to thank you for taking time out of your,

2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:25.160
 not just immensely busy, but very important schedule

2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:27.440
 because again, the work that you're doing

2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:30.920
 is really out there on that cutting,

2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:31.920
 I don't want to say bleeding edge,

2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.720
 because in this context, it's not going to sound right,

2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:37.000
 but on that extreme cutting edge of what we understand

2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:40.000
 about how the human brain works and how it can be repaired.

2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:41.560
 They're doing marvelous work.

2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:44.140
 We will point people to various places

2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:45.680
 they can find you online,

2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:49.600
 and should they need the help of your clinic,

2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:52.200
 to your clinic and your laboratory as well.

2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:55.240
 So on behalf of everybody and myself as well,

2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:57.120
 thank you so, so very much.

2:11:57.120 --> 2:11:57.960
 I'm honored.

2:11:57.960 --> 2:11:59.120
 Thank you so much for having me.

2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:00.160
 Thank you for joining me today

2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:02.340
 for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern

2:12:02.340 --> 2:12:04.440
 about the use of deep brain stimulation

2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:07.360
 and novel technologies for the treatment of eating disorders

2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:09.460
 and movement disorders of various kinds.

2:12:09.460 --> 2:12:10.560

 Not so much today, but in many previous episodes

2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:56.720
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.

2:12:56.720 --> 2:12:58.920
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:00.920
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:02.900
 for things like enhancing sleep and focus

2:13:02.900 --> 2:13:04.580
 and hormone optimization.

2:13:04.580 --> 2:13:06.040
 The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered

2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:07.240
 with Momentous Supplements.

2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:08.320
 If you'd like to see the supplements

2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:09.800
 that the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered

2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:12.280
 with Momentous on, you can go to Live Momentous,

2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:15.720
 spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:17.680
 And there you'll see a number of the supplements

2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:19.640
 that we talk about regularly on the podcast.

2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:21.580
 I should just mention that that catalog of supplements

2:13:21.580 --> 2:13:23.060
 is constantly being updated.

2:13:23.060 --> 2:13:24.000
 If you haven't already signed up

2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:25.200
 for the neural network newsletter,

2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:27.960
 this is a monthly Huberman Lab Podcast newsletter

2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:31.000
 in which you get some brief show notes summaries,

2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.960
 as well as a lot of actionable tools in summary form.

2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:36.880
 Many people find these very useful for distilling out

2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:39.560
 the vast amount of information that we cover on the podcast.

2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:41.880
 So for instance, if you go to HubermanLab.com,

2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:43.640
 you can click on the menu,

2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:47.040
 click to neural network newsletter or simply newsletter,

2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:49.000
 and you can sign up, just give us your email.

2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:50.880
 We do not share your email with anybody.

2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:53.180
 And again, it's completely zero cost.

2:13:53.180 --> 2:13:55.360
 We also have examples of previous newsletters

2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:56.500
 that you can download immediately

2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:57.880
 without having to sign up for anything

2:13:57.880 --> 2:13:59.540
 and decide whether or not you want to sign up.

2:13:59.540 --> 2:14:01.120
 Again, that's the neural network newsletter

2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:02.880
 at HubermanLab.com.

2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:04.960
 If you're not already following us on social media,

2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:08.080
 we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, on Twitter, on Facebook,

2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.080
 and on LinkedIn, and especially on Instagram and on Twitter,

2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:14.360
 I cover many of the tools that are discussed

2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:15.380
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:14:15.380 --> 2:14:17.220
 but also a lot of science and science-based tools

2:14:17.220 --> 2:14:19.400
 not covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:21.640
 Again, it's Huberman Lab on all platforms.

2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:23.320
 Once again, thank you for joining me today

2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:25.300
 for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern.

2:14:25.300 --> 2:14:27.400
 I hope you learned as much as I did,

2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:30.280
 and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:57.280
 I'll see you in the next one.
