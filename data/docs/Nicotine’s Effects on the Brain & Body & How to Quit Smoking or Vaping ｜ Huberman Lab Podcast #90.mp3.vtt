00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.300
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.300 --> 00:13.260
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.260 --> 00:15.100
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.200
 Today, we are discussing nicotine.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.860
 Nicotine is one of the most commonly consumed substances

00:19.860 --> 00:21.620
 on the entire planet.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.720
 There are literally billions of people

00:23.720 --> 00:26.620
 that ingest nicotine on a daily basis.

00:26.620 --> 00:29.660
 Most of those people consume nicotine via smoking

00:29.660 --> 00:31.860
 and in particular, smoking tobacco.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.420
 Tobacco contains nicotine

00:33.420 --> 00:35.920
 and it contains a bunch of other things as well,

00:35.920 --> 00:37.140
 which we will talk about.

00:37.140 --> 00:39.380
 And the burning of tobacco liberates nicotine

00:39.380 --> 00:41.840
 and makes it accessible to the various cells

00:41.840 --> 00:43.140
 and tissues of the body.

00:43.140 --> 00:45.700
 But of course, there are other sources of nicotine as well.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.220
 Some people consume nicotine through dip,

00:48.220 --> 00:51.140
 that is placing tobacco on the inside of the lip

00:51.140 --> 00:52.820
 or in the cheek.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.420
 Some people consume nicotine via snuff,

00:55.420 --> 00:57.740
 which is literally the shoving of tobacco leaves

00:57.740 --> 01:00.460
 up the nostrils and allowing the tobacco

01:00.460 --> 01:03.900
 to access the nervous system and other areas of the body

01:03.900 --> 01:06.460
 by permeating into the mucosal membranes,

01:06.460 --> 01:09.940
 as is the lining, the soft lining of the nasal passages.

01:09.940 --> 01:12.700
 And of course, there are nicotine patches, nicotine gum,

01:12.700 --> 01:14.340
 there's nicotine in pill form,

01:14.340 --> 01:17.160
 there are toothpicks dipped in nicotine, et cetera.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.860
 Today, we are going to separate our discussion of nicotine

01:19.860 --> 01:22.220
 from a discussion of smoking and vaping

01:22.220 --> 01:24.540
 and the other forms of delivery for nicotine.

01:24.540 --> 01:27.080
 We will be talking about smoking and vaping

01:27.080 --> 01:29.500
 and other routes of nicotine administration,

01:29.500 --> 01:33.820
 both for sake of highlighting their detriments to health

01:33.820 --> 01:37.540
 and believe it or not, in certain cases,

01:37.540 --> 01:40.040
 keep in mind, very specific certain cases,

01:40.040 --> 01:43.040
 the possible health benefits of delivering nicotine

01:43.040 --> 01:45.540
 through specific modalities.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.900
 It turns out those modalities

01:46.900 --> 01:50.780
 do not include smoking cigarettes or vaping.

01:50.780 --> 01:53.700
 And we are going to pay particular attention to vaping today

01:53.700 --> 01:56.300
 because vaping use is on the rise,

01:56.300 --> 01:58.580
 in particular in young people,

01:58.580 --> 02:02.900
 and vaping use and the fact that most tobacco

02:02.900 --> 02:04.140
 that's consumed through vaping

02:04.140 --> 02:06.740
 includes quite amount of nicotine

02:06.740 --> 02:09.040
 has created a scenario where nicotine,

02:09.040 --> 02:11.500
 because of its ability to change certain chemicals

02:11.500 --> 02:14.220
 in the brain, can actually lead to addiction

02:14.220 --> 02:16.500
 for a number of other substances

02:16.500 --> 02:19.500
 related to vaping and vaping-associated behaviors.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.860
 If all of that seems like a lot to get your arms

02:21.860 --> 02:24.060
 and your mind around right here at the outset,

02:24.060 --> 02:26.400
 don't worry, I'll walk you through this,

02:26.400 --> 02:27.240
 regardless of whether or not

02:27.240 --> 02:28.940
 you have a background in biology or not,

02:28.940 --> 02:30.420
 I promise that you'll come through

02:30.420 --> 02:33.060
 at the end of this episode with a deep understanding

02:33.060 --> 02:35.220
 of how nicotine works in the brain and body,

02:35.220 --> 02:38.300
 some of its benefits, some of its potential drawbacks,

02:38.300 --> 02:39.860
 and you will have clear optics

02:39.860 --> 02:42.420
 as to why smoking and vaping

02:42.420 --> 02:43.940
 and other forms of nicotine delivery

02:43.940 --> 02:45.740
 have the effects that they do

02:45.740 --> 02:47.860
 on your biology and psychology.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.740
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:49.740 --> 02:52.060
 is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.280
 We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.980
 First of all, they ship internationally

02:55.980 --> 02:57.900
 because we know that many of you are located

02:57.900 --> 02:59.380
 outside of the United States.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.400
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

03:01.400 --> 03:03.940
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

03:03.940 --> 03:05.620
 both in terms of purity and precision

03:05.620 --> 03:07.560
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.200
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

03:10.200 --> 03:12.380
 that are single ingredient supplements

03:12.380 --> 03:14.460
 and that are supplied in dosages

03:14.460 --> 03:17.420
 that allow you to build a supplementation protocol

03:17.420 --> 03:19.260
 that's optimized for cost,

03:19.260 --> 03:21.140
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

03:21.140 --> 03:23.280
 and that you can add things and remove things

03:23.280 --> 03:24.620
 from your protocol in a way

03:24.620 --> 03:26.400
 that's really systematic and scientific.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.580
 If you'd like to see the supplements

03:27.580 --> 03:28.900
 that we've partnered with Momentus on,

03:28.900 --> 03:32.020
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.140
 There you'll see those supplements,

03:33.140 --> 03:35.600
 and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

03:35.600 --> 03:38.300
 the library of supplements available through Momentus

03:38.300 --> 03:39.240
 on a regular basis.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.860
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

03:41.860 --> 03:42.900
 Before we go any further,

03:42.900 --> 03:45.140
 I just want to highlight a key takeaway

03:45.140 --> 03:46.380
 from a previous episode,

03:46.380 --> 03:48.920
 which is our episode on focus,

03:48.920 --> 03:51.780
 and in fact was a toolkit for focus.

03:51.780 --> 03:53.540
 So during the toolkit for focus episode,

03:53.540 --> 03:55.980
 we talked about a large number of behavioral pharmacologic

03:55.980 --> 03:58.120
 and other interventions that you can use

03:58.120 --> 04:00.620
 to increase your level of concentration and focus

04:00.620 --> 04:02.980
 for whatever purpose, cognitive endeavors,

04:02.980 --> 04:05.180
 learning languages, focusing in school,

04:05.180 --> 04:08.180
 on work, et cetera, or physical pursuits.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.960
 Now, one of the key takeaways

04:09.960 --> 04:13.500
 is that there are really two key protocols

04:13.500 --> 04:15.820
 that I believe everyone should understand and know about

04:15.820 --> 04:18.500
 and why they work, because they are so effective

04:18.500 --> 04:20.740
 and also because they dovetail nicely

04:20.740 --> 04:21.740
 with some of the information

04:21.740 --> 04:23.380
 that we're going to talk about today,

04:23.380 --> 04:25.060
 which will explain why nicotine

04:25.060 --> 04:28.140
 is so effective in increasing focus.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.620
 And these two protocols are as follows.

04:30.620 --> 04:33.740
 Data based on studies done in Wendy Suzuki's lab

04:33.740 --> 04:35.460
 at New York University.

04:35.460 --> 04:37.940
 Of course, Wendy was a guest on this podcast,

04:37.940 --> 04:39.740
 so you can check out that episode if you like,

04:39.740 --> 04:41.740
 but studies done in her laboratory

04:41.740 --> 04:44.060
 point to the fact that a daily, very brief,

04:44.060 --> 04:47.060
 in fact, only 13 minute meditation

04:47.060 --> 04:50.400
 can vastly increase focus and focus ability,

04:50.400 --> 04:53.580
 not just immediately after the meditation practice,

04:53.580 --> 04:55.640
 but at all other times as well.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.580
 So again, this is a meditation practice done daily

04:58.580 --> 04:59.660
 for just 13 minutes.

04:59.660 --> 05:01.180
 It's a very simple meditation practice

05:01.180 --> 05:04.460
 where one sits or lies down, closes your eyes,

05:04.460 --> 05:07.420
 and directs your attention to a place

05:07.420 --> 05:09.740
 just between your two eyes and right above it,

05:09.740 --> 05:11.800
 so on your forehead, but just inside of that.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.540
 And please understand that your brain

05:13.540 --> 05:14.820
 does not have sensory receptors.

05:14.820 --> 05:16.700
 So unlike focusing on your fingertips

05:16.700 --> 05:19.540
 and the sensations there, if you focus on your brain,

05:19.540 --> 05:21.420
 you can't actually sense anything in your brain

05:21.420 --> 05:22.240
 except your thoughts.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.380
 So the idea then is that you continually bring your focus

05:25.380 --> 05:28.060
 back to that location just about an inch

05:28.060 --> 05:30.140
 behind your forehead over and over again.

05:30.140 --> 05:33.340
 And it's the refocusing of your attention to that location

05:33.340 --> 05:35.420
 after it drifts that succeeds

05:35.420 --> 05:37.000
 in increasing your focus ability,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.280
 again, not just during the meditation and afterward,

05:39.280 --> 05:40.900
 but at other times as well.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.660
 So this 13 minute a day meditation is exceedingly simple

05:43.660 --> 05:45.460
 and exceedingly effective.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.900
 It should be performed every day,

05:46.900 --> 05:49.000
 but if you miss a day, just go back to doing it,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.380
 don't despair too much,

05:50.380 --> 05:52.760
 and you will see these positive effects save the data,

05:52.760 --> 05:54.500
 also increase effects on mood

05:54.500 --> 05:57.340
 and other positive aspects of mental health and performance.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.140
 So that's the first tool in protocol.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.820
 The second tool in protocol relates to the general,

06:01.820 --> 06:04.660
 what I call the aero model of focus.

06:04.660 --> 06:07.300
 This was a model that I created in order to simplify

06:07.300 --> 06:09.980
 the vast amounts of data on focus and concentration

06:09.980 --> 06:12.780
 and how they are created by the various chemical systems

06:12.780 --> 06:14.020
 within your brain.

06:14.020 --> 06:15.860
 We're going to hear a lot about these chemical systems

06:15.860 --> 06:17.420
 again today in the context of nicotine,

06:17.420 --> 06:19.400
 and they are as follows.

06:19.400 --> 06:23.140
 You can think about focus on any goal or any endeavor

06:23.140 --> 06:23.980
 as an aero.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.740
 So just imagine an aero which has an aero head and a shaft,

06:26.740 --> 06:29.820
 and we'll add a third component to it in a moment.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.680
 The head of the aero, meaning the direction of your focus

06:32.680 --> 06:35.140
 is largely set by acetylcholine,

06:35.140 --> 06:36.660
 which is a chemical in the brain.

06:36.660 --> 06:41.060
 The shaft of the aero is set by a chemical called adrenaline,

06:41.060 --> 06:42.540
 also called epinephrine.

06:42.540 --> 06:43.420
 Those are the same thing.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.220
 In the brain, typically, it's referred to as epinephrine,

06:46.220 --> 06:48.380
 and in the body, it's more commonly referred to

06:48.380 --> 06:51.040
 as adrenaline, but those are the same neurochemical.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.280
 Epinephrine slash adrenaline represents the shaft

06:54.280 --> 06:57.480
 of the aero, and it's providing the energy

06:57.480 --> 06:59.180
 for which to focus.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.660
 And then we can put behind that aero a little propeller

07:01.660 --> 07:03.140
 or a motor, if you like.

07:03.140 --> 07:04.900
 And the propeller or motor in the context

07:04.900 --> 07:07.420
 of this neurochemistry model is dopamine,

07:07.420 --> 07:09.140
 which provides ongoing motivation.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.660
 It pushes that aero forward continually

07:11.660 --> 07:15.140
 as you strive to focus on a particular thing.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.700
 This particular aero model,

07:16.700 --> 07:19.620
 that is your ability to increase your focus,

07:19.620 --> 07:21.180
 can be enhanced, therefore,

07:21.180 --> 07:24.640
 by increasing acetylcholine, epinephrine,

07:24.640 --> 07:26.660
 and dopamine simultaneously.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.360
 And there are a lot of different ways to do that,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.380
 but one of the more effective ways to do that

07:30.380 --> 07:34.160
 via supplement protocols is so-called alpha-GPC.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.780
 Alpha-GPC taken in 300 milligram form,

07:37.780 --> 07:40.380
 10 to 30 minutes before a bout of cognitive work

07:40.380 --> 07:43.060
 or a bout of physical work will increase your focus

07:43.060 --> 07:45.700
 by way of increasing acetylcholine and to some extent,

07:45.700 --> 07:48.820
 increasing epinephrine as well.

07:48.820 --> 07:50.820
 The dopamine increase will have to be achieved

07:50.820 --> 07:53.140
 either through cognitive processing,

07:53.140 --> 07:54.840
 that is telling yourself you're doing a good job

07:54.840 --> 07:57.140
 and moving forward because thoughts really do impact

07:57.140 --> 08:00.740
 your levels of dopamine, or some other sort of pro-dopamine

08:00.740 --> 08:02.860
 or dopamine increasing protocol,

08:02.860 --> 08:05.120
 also discussed in the toolkit for focus

08:05.120 --> 08:08.020
 and our episode on dopamine for motivation and drive.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.460
 So the key thing here to understand

08:09.460 --> 08:11.540
 is that the 13 minute a day meditation

08:11.540 --> 08:14.180
 is a very effective way to increase focus capacity.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.460
 And then in the short term,

08:15.460 --> 08:18.580
 if you want to provide a boost now and again to focus,

08:18.580 --> 08:21.360
 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC can be very effective.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.700
 There are various sources for that,

08:22.700 --> 08:26.020
 then we'll link to one of them in the show note captions.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.740
 By no means am I saying that you need to take alpha-GPC,

08:28.740 --> 08:30.700
 a number of people will certainly opt not to,

08:30.700 --> 08:32.980
 and a number of people might be saying,

08:32.980 --> 08:35.360
 well, I've heard that alpha-GPC can increase focus

08:35.360 --> 08:38.020
 by way of increasing acetylcholine and norepinephrine

08:38.020 --> 08:41.060
 or epinephrine, but it can also increase TMAO,

08:41.060 --> 08:44.140
 which is a kind of a negative marker of cardiac health

08:44.140 --> 08:45.640
 and cardiovascular health.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.980
 For that reason, I and many others will take 600 milligrams

08:48.980 --> 08:53.340
 of a garlic capsule, which can offset that TMAO increase.

08:53.340 --> 08:56.320
 It remains uncertain as to how much alpha-GPC

08:56.320 --> 08:59.260
 one needs to take before increasing TMAO levels

08:59.260 --> 09:00.620
 to a point where it's of concern

09:00.620 --> 09:02.740
 that you would even need to take the garlic capsule.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.520
 But I just mention it in any case

09:04.520 --> 09:06.300
 because it's a pretty simple fix.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.720
 Garlic has other health benefits too, of course.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.740
 And for most people, 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC

09:11.740 --> 09:13.220
 taken every once in a while.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.780
 I certainly don't encourage people to take alpha-GPC

09:15.780 --> 09:17.620
 every time they want to focus.

09:17.620 --> 09:20.580
 I always emphasize behavioral tools first,

09:20.580 --> 09:22.820
 then focusing on nutritional tools,

09:22.820 --> 09:25.460
 and on occasion using supplement-based tools

09:25.460 --> 09:28.980
 to encourage increased levels of focus.

09:28.980 --> 09:29.860
 And then of course,

09:29.860 --> 09:33.880
 there are a number of different prescription compounds

09:33.880 --> 09:36.100
 that if you're working with a board certified physician,

09:36.100 --> 09:38.680
 they could prescribe you if you need additional tools

09:38.680 --> 09:40.420
 for focus, things like Ritalin, Adderall,

09:40.420 --> 09:43.120
 Modafinil, Armodafinil, Vyvanse, et cetera,

09:43.120 --> 09:44.860
 for many people are going to be important

09:44.860 --> 09:48.100
 and maybe even necessary for people with ADHD, et cetera.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.620
 But that's a category into itself.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.260
 And as I always say, I'm not a physician,

09:51.260 --> 09:52.740
 so I don't prescribe anything.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.340
 I'm a professor, so I profess many things.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.740
 And today, I just wanted to pass along

09:57.740 --> 10:01.500
 or redirect your attention to that episode on focus

10:01.500 --> 10:02.800
 and highlight those two tools,

10:02.800 --> 10:04.740
 the 13-minute-a-day meditation

10:04.740 --> 10:08.700
 and 300-milligram Alpha-GPC for increasing focus capacity

10:08.700 --> 10:11.440
 and for acutely, that is temporarily,

10:11.440 --> 10:14.460
 giving an additional boost for about a focus.

10:14.460 --> 10:17.060
 And of course, if you choose not to use those protocols,

10:17.060 --> 10:18.200
 that's perfectly fine too.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.500
 There's certainly no obligation.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.740
 They are simply available to you

10:20.740 --> 10:22.900
 should you choose to try them.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.820
 And if nothing else, you now have in mind

10:25.820 --> 10:28.060
 the neurochemistry of acetylcholine,

10:28.060 --> 10:30.460
 epinephrine slash adrenaline, and dopamine,

10:30.460 --> 10:32.980
 and that will really set the stage for understanding

10:32.980 --> 10:37.140
 just how effective and why nicotine is so effective

10:37.140 --> 10:39.020
 at increasing focus, motivation,

10:39.020 --> 10:40.700
 and even, as you'll soon hear,

10:40.700 --> 10:42.820
 working memory and cognitive capacity.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.580
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

10:44.580 --> 10:45.940
 that this podcast is separate

10:45.940 --> 10:48.220
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

10:48.220 --> 10:50.540
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

10:50.540 --> 10:52.460
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

10:52.460 --> 10:54.620
 about science and science-related tools

10:54.620 --> 10:55.880
 to the general public.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.940
 In keeping with that theme,

10:56.940 --> 10:59.580
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.580
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

11:01.580 --> 11:03.780
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

11:03.780 --> 11:06.980
 And to be quite direct, I do not like the word nootropics

11:06.980 --> 11:09.560
 because it translates to smart drugs.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.820
 And to be direct, again,

11:11.820 --> 11:13.840
 there is no such thing as a smart drug.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.960
 That is, there's no such thing as a drug

11:15.960 --> 11:17.440
 that can make you smarter

11:17.440 --> 11:19.940
 because there is no circuit in the brain for being smart.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.300
 There are circuits in the brain for focus.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.700
 There are circuits in the brain for task switching.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.020
 There are circuits in the brain related to creativity

11:26.020 --> 11:27.300
 and so on and so forth.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.600
 So the idea that there would be a single smart drug

11:29.600 --> 11:32.620
 or nootropic is simply foolish.

11:32.620 --> 11:35.120
 And fortunately, Thesis understands this

11:35.120 --> 11:38.000
 and therefore has created custom nootropics

11:38.000 --> 11:40.420
 that are designed to get you into the states of mind

11:40.420 --> 11:42.700
 and body that are optimal for your goals.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.100
 I've been taking thesis nootropics for quite a while now,

11:45.100 --> 11:47.800
 and I've been extremely pleased with the results.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.380
 I take a clarity formula that's specifically designed

11:50.380 --> 11:53.060
 for me prior to long bouts of cognitive work.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.240
 And I take an energy formula prior

11:55.240 --> 11:57.700
 to particularly challenging physical workouts.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.900
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

11:59.900 --> 12:03.420
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

12:03.420 --> 12:04.620
 take a three minute quiz,

12:04.620 --> 12:06.860
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

12:06.860 --> 12:08.200
 to try in your first month.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.980
 Again, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman

12:14.780 --> 12:17.460
 Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.900
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

12:19.900 --> 12:22.300
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

12:22.300 --> 12:24.620
 to help you better reach your health goals.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.540
 I've long been a believer

12:25.540 --> 12:26.940
 in getting regular blood work done

12:26.940 --> 12:29.140
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

12:29.140 --> 12:31.040
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

12:31.040 --> 12:33.660
 can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.980
 One of the major issues with blood tests or DNA tests,

12:35.980 --> 12:38.580
 however, is that typically you'll get your data back

12:38.580 --> 12:40.660
 and you won't know what to do with those data.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.420
 InsideTracker has solved this problem

12:42.420 --> 12:44.600
 by creating a personalized platform

12:44.600 --> 12:45.780
 where when you get numbers back

12:45.780 --> 12:48.460
 about your hormones, metabolic factors, et cetera,

12:48.460 --> 12:50.500
 it will direct you to specific protocols

12:50.500 --> 12:53.540
 in the realms of nutrition, exercise, supplementation,

12:53.540 --> 12:56.540
 and that includes things to do, things to consider,

12:56.540 --> 12:59.020
 and things not to do in order to bring those numbers

12:59.020 --> 13:00.620
 into the ranges that are optimal

13:00.620 --> 13:02.660
 for your immediate and long-term goals.

13:02.660 --> 13:04.060
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

13:04.060 --> 13:06.780

13:13.700 --> 13:16.140
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

13:16.140 --> 13:18.020
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

13:18.020 --> 13:19.980
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.980
 The company was founded by two All-American swimmers

13:21.980 --> 13:24.540
 from Stanford and everything about Roka eyeglasses

13:24.540 --> 13:27.300
 and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.980
 I've spent a lifetime working on the biology

13:28.980 --> 13:29.820
 of the visual system,

13:29.820 --> 13:31.380
 and I can tell you that your visual system

13:31.380 --> 13:33.480
 has to contend with a number of important challenges

13:33.480 --> 13:35.300
 in order for you to be able to see clearly.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.480
 Now, Roka understands this,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.820
 and everything about their eyeglasses were designed

13:38.820 --> 13:40.780
 in order for you to see with optimal clarity

13:40.780 --> 13:42.140
 regardless of activities.

13:42.140 --> 13:44.700
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are superb

13:44.700 --> 13:46.820
 for wearing while you run or cycle.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.860
 In fact, they were originally designed for that purpose.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.060
 They're extremely lightweight.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.020
 In fact, most of the time I can't even remember

13:52.020 --> 13:53.340
 that they're on my face,

13:53.340 --> 13:56.220
 and they won't fall off if you get sweaty.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.940
 In addition, Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

13:58.940 --> 14:00.340
 have a terrific aesthetic.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.780
 So while a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses out there

14:02.780 --> 14:04.620
 will make you look like a cyborg if you want to,

14:04.620 --> 14:05.980
 and they do have those varieties,

14:05.980 --> 14:09.020
 they also have varieties of aesthetic choices

14:09.020 --> 14:11.220
 that you would be very comfortable wearing to work

14:11.220 --> 14:13.140
 or to school or just out and about.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.220
 And that's one of the reasons I like them.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.940
 I don't really have to think about having too many pairs

14:15.940 --> 14:17.500
 of sunglasses or eyeglasses.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.300
 I can just have one or two of each pair,

14:19.300 --> 14:21.560
 and I'm good to go no matter where I go.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.180
 If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,

14:24.180 --> 14:26.660
 you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,

14:26.660 --> 14:29.140
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off

14:29.140 --> 14:30.020
 on your first order.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.380
 Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,

14:32.380 --> 14:34.820
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

14:34.820 --> 14:36.140
 Let's talk about nicotine

14:36.140 --> 14:39.560
 and how nicotine impacts our brains, our bodies,

14:39.560 --> 14:42.180
 our mental performance, our mental health,

14:42.180 --> 14:45.100
 our physical performance, and our physical health.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.700
 And once again, I want to remind everybody

14:46.700 --> 14:48.580
 that we really need to separate out

14:48.580 --> 14:50.300
 a discussion about nicotine

14:50.300 --> 14:53.740
 from the discussion about the delivery device for nicotine.

14:53.740 --> 14:56.080
 In other words, when we're talking about nicotine,

14:56.080 --> 14:58.640
 we are not necessarily talking about smoking,

14:58.640 --> 14:59.980
 although we might be.

14:59.980 --> 15:03.460
 There are things associated with smoking and with vaping

15:03.460 --> 15:06.820
 and other means of getting nicotine into our system

15:06.820 --> 15:08.600
 that have their own effects,

15:08.600 --> 15:12.000
 both negative and in some cases, positive.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.780
 Indeed, later we will talk about

15:13.780 --> 15:15.620
 how you can actually use nicotine

15:15.620 --> 15:17.100
 to get over smoking addiction.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.180
 This won't come as a surprise to many people,

15:19.180 --> 15:21.380
 but what perhaps will come as a surprise

15:21.380 --> 15:22.420
 is the fact that many people

15:22.420 --> 15:26.040
 actually use nicotine-like substances or nicotine itself

15:26.040 --> 15:28.500
 in order to relieve nicotine addiction.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.420
 So we'll talk about that and what that looks like

15:30.420 --> 15:34.220
 and offer various protocols for you later in the episode.

15:34.220 --> 15:35.700
 I also want to mention here at the outset

15:35.700 --> 15:38.620
 that I have a longstanding interest in nicotine.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.680
 In fact, early in my scientific career,

15:40.680 --> 15:44.500
 I did research on nicotine and its role in brain development

15:44.500 --> 15:47.880
 and I've had a longstanding interest in neuroplasticity,

15:47.880 --> 15:50.500
 the brain's ability to change in response to experience.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.620
 And so experiments that have been done by close colleagues

15:52.620 --> 15:55.120
 and friends of mine have really emphasized the fact

15:55.120 --> 15:57.420
 that acetylcholine and in particular,

15:57.420 --> 16:01.340
 when acetylcholine activates so-called nicotinic receptors,

16:01.340 --> 16:03.620
 something you'll learn more about in a little bit,

16:03.620 --> 16:06.900
 that can actually serve as a gateway or a trigger

16:06.900 --> 16:09.180
 for directed rewiring of the brain.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.100
 So this is fascinating.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.380
 We think of nicotine as something that we take,

16:12.380 --> 16:14.660
 but actually we have receptors,

16:14.660 --> 16:16.700
 that is locations in the brain

16:16.700 --> 16:20.660
 to which nicotine binds and can exert its effects.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.300
 And those receptors did not come about

16:22.300 --> 16:24.140
 because of the existence of tobacco

16:24.140 --> 16:25.940
 or the existence of vaping pens

16:25.940 --> 16:28.980
 or because of the existence of anything in the outside world.

16:28.980 --> 16:32.560
 The fact that there are nicotinic receptors

16:32.560 --> 16:36.500
 in our brain and body tells you that acetylcholine

16:36.500 --> 16:38.980
 and nicotine themselves have very important roles

16:38.980 --> 16:41.660
 in normal brain and body function.

16:41.660 --> 16:44.540
 So much so that I often like to point to an anecdote

16:44.540 --> 16:48.300
 of a very well-known Nobel prize-winning neuroscientist.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.460
 I won't reveal who they are.

16:49.460 --> 16:50.960
 They're not a faculty member at Stanford,

16:50.960 --> 16:54.300
 but many neuroscientists know of this person

16:54.300 --> 16:56.460
 and many people in the outside world know of this person.

16:56.460 --> 17:00.940
 And they are also well-known for their love of nicotine.

17:00.940 --> 17:03.420
 I once sat in this person's office and he,

17:03.420 --> 17:04.820
 I will reveal that as a he,

17:05.880 --> 17:10.340
 consumed no fewer than three pieces of nicotine gum

17:10.340 --> 17:12.380
 during that relatively short conversation

17:12.380 --> 17:13.860
 of about 45 minutes.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.500
 And that was surprising to me.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.280
 And I asked him why he was taking so much nicotine

17:19.280 --> 17:20.700
 through nicotine gum.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.700
 And he replied that for years he had been a chronic smoker,

17:23.700 --> 17:26.160
 which on the one hand had greatly impaired

17:26.160 --> 17:28.020
 his cardiovascular health and his fitness,

17:28.020 --> 17:28.860
 no surprise there.

17:28.860 --> 17:29.980
 And we'll talk a little bit more about

17:29.980 --> 17:31.620
 what the underlying reasons are.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.900
 But most everyone, if not everyone knows

17:33.900 --> 17:37.260
 that smoking cigarettes or smoking in general

17:37.260 --> 17:38.840
 really impairs lung health.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.680
 There's just simply no question about it.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.860
 There are some more or less unhealthy ways to smoke,

17:44.860 --> 17:48.480
 but the quite honest message is that smoking of any kind

17:48.480 --> 17:51.220
 is going to disrupt lung endothelial function,

17:51.220 --> 17:53.620
 lung function, blood vessels, and so forth.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.500
 It's going to make it harder to breathe with vigor,

17:55.500 --> 17:58.840
 take deep breaths, deliver oxygen to tissues, et cetera.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.280
 That said, he also pointed out

18:01.280 --> 18:04.660
 that the data on nicotine specifically

18:04.660 --> 18:08.220
 are pointing to the fact that nicotine can be,

18:08.220 --> 18:10.980
 can be protective against certain forms

18:10.980 --> 18:12.620
 of cognitive impairment.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.820
 And that is why he continued to chew

18:14.820 --> 18:16.300
 nicotine containing gum.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.540
 And he swore by the focus enhancing

18:18.540 --> 18:20.060
 and motivation enhancing effects

18:20.060 --> 18:22.220
 of nicotine containing gum.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.700
 Now that is not a call to arms for you to run out

18:24.700 --> 18:28.520
 and start chewing or consuming nicotine containing products.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.760
 We will talk about those products later in the episode,

18:30.760 --> 18:32.220
 some of their potential advantages,

18:32.220 --> 18:34.120
 some of their potential disadvantages.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.380
 Now I share this anecdote because it nicely separates

18:37.380 --> 18:39.220
 nicotine from the delivery device

18:39.220 --> 18:41.340
 through which nicotine arrives.

18:41.340 --> 18:43.980
 Now, I haven't talked to this individual in a few years

18:44.980 --> 18:46.740
 to see whether or not the nicotine is working

18:46.740 --> 18:49.600
 to stave off any kind of Alzheimer's or neurodegenerative

18:49.600 --> 18:52.180
 or cognitive impairment that would come with age.

18:52.180 --> 18:55.020
 This gentleman is getting up in the years

18:55.020 --> 18:57.200
 and seems quite sharp nonetheless,

18:57.200 --> 19:00.160
 but then again was always exceedingly sharp.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.740
 The point is nicotine is a substance

19:03.740 --> 19:06.660
 that can both promote cognitive function

19:06.660 --> 19:10.820
 and under some conditions if taken to inappropriate

19:10.820 --> 19:12.680
 or I should say to extreme dosages

19:12.680 --> 19:14.740
 can also impair cognitive function.

19:14.740 --> 19:17.200
 So today we really need to have a nuanced conversation

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
 about nicotine.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.020
 One that includes some of the benefits,

19:20.020 --> 19:23.380
 some of the drawbacks in particular for children,

19:23.380 --> 19:25.680
 certainly for people that are pregnant,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.840
 for people that have addictive tendencies

19:27.840 --> 19:29.780
 and for people that have depression

19:29.780 --> 19:32.340
 and any other kind of mood disorders.

19:32.340 --> 19:35.480
 What I will tell you soon is that nicotine

19:35.480 --> 19:38.620
 can be very powerful as a mood modulator

19:38.620 --> 19:41.420
 and many people who have tried to quit nicotine,

19:41.420 --> 19:43.460
 mainly through the form of smoking,

19:43.460 --> 19:46.380
 will find that their mood can drop substantially.

19:46.380 --> 19:49.140
 So nicotine does a lot of things in the brain and body

19:49.140 --> 19:50.940
 and so I'd like to begin by talking about

19:50.940 --> 19:52.940
 what exactly nicotine is

19:52.940 --> 19:55.340
 and how it impacts your brain and body.

19:55.340 --> 19:57.540
 So what is nicotine and where is it found?

19:57.540 --> 20:00.420
 Obviously nicotine is found in the tobacco plant,

20:00.420 --> 20:03.700
 but nicotine is also found in nightshades,

20:03.700 --> 20:07.180
 that is tomatoes, eggplants and sweet peppers.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.240
 Although the concentrations of nicotine

20:09.240 --> 20:11.100
 in tomatoes, eggplants and sweet peppers

20:11.100 --> 20:15.060
 is vastly lower than it is in the tobacco plant.

20:15.060 --> 20:18.140
 You actually can also find nicotine in potatoes.

20:18.140 --> 20:21.800
 Now, why is nicotine present in potatoes and tomatoes

20:21.800 --> 20:24.120
 and in the tobacco plant at all?

20:24.120 --> 20:26.460
 Well, nicotine is a plant alkaloid,

20:26.460 --> 20:28.340
 we'll get into alkaloids a little bit later,

20:28.340 --> 20:31.940
 but it is thought that these alkaloids evolved in plants

20:31.940 --> 20:35.980
 as a way to prevent insects from eating them.

20:35.980 --> 20:38.240
 And without going into a lot of insect biology,

20:38.240 --> 20:40.940
 the reason or the rationale behind this explanation

20:40.940 --> 20:44.420
 is that nicotine is not only a substance in tobacco

20:44.420 --> 20:46.340
 that people use or in the various medications

20:46.340 --> 20:49.260
 that people use, but it's also used as a pesticide

20:49.260 --> 20:51.660
 because it can dramatically disrupt

20:51.660 --> 20:54.020
 the nervous system of insects.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.780
 It can render them infertile,

20:55.780 --> 20:58.380
 which is not to say that it renders humans infertile.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.380
 I want to say again, it is not the case

21:00.380 --> 21:02.300
 that nicotine renders humans infertile,

21:02.300 --> 21:04.660
 but it can make certain insects infertile.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.760
 It can actually disrupt their motor function

21:06.760 --> 21:07.980
 and their brain function.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.440
 And the reasons that it has such different effects

21:10.440 --> 21:13.060
 on insects, in other words, it can kill them

21:13.060 --> 21:14.900
 or prevent them from reproducing

21:15.780 --> 21:18.540
 and therefore explains why plants probably evolved

21:18.540 --> 21:20.620
 to have this plant alkaloid, nicotine.

21:20.620 --> 21:23.180
 In humans, because of the differences

21:23.180 --> 21:25.980
 in receptors for nicotine,

21:25.980 --> 21:28.380
 where they're located in the types of receptors,

21:28.380 --> 21:31.340
 the effects of nicotine on humans is quite a bit different.

21:31.340 --> 21:33.940
 And again, it does not cause infertility in humans.

21:33.940 --> 21:35.700
 Although I will talk a little bit later

21:35.700 --> 21:37.380
 about some double-blind peer-reviewed studies

21:37.380 --> 21:41.600
 conducted in humans that indicate that, for instance,

21:41.600 --> 21:44.260
 nicotine can reduce penile girth,

21:44.260 --> 21:45.460
 that is the girth of the penis,

21:45.460 --> 21:48.700
 and can lead to certain forms of sexual dysfunction.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.300
 And those changes are largely downstream

21:51.300 --> 21:54.980
 of changes in blood flow and endothelial cell function.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.300
 Endothelial cells are the cells

21:56.300 --> 21:59.780
 that make up blood vessels and other vascular-type tissues

21:59.780 --> 22:00.940
 within the brain and body.

22:00.940 --> 22:02.940
 So nicotine is found in these plants.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.260
 And what we can know for sure

22:05.260 --> 22:07.940
 is that at some point in human evolution,

22:07.940 --> 22:09.940
 somebody or some group of people,

22:09.940 --> 22:12.340
 either, and here I'm completely guessing,

22:12.340 --> 22:14.440
 it's a just-so story,

22:14.440 --> 22:18.940
 but someone or some group must have inhaled the smoke

22:18.940 --> 22:20.700
 from the tobacco plant

22:20.700 --> 22:24.200
 or put the dried leaves of the tobacco plant

22:24.200 --> 22:25.980
 against some mucosal tissue,

22:25.980 --> 22:27.880
 any of the different mucosal linings of their body

22:27.880 --> 22:31.140
 by which substances can pass through, that's right.

22:31.140 --> 22:34.460
 Any of the mucosal soft-lining tissues of the body

22:34.460 --> 22:36.180
 will allow certain substances,

22:36.180 --> 22:37.940
 not all certain substances, to pass in.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.760
 That's why people can put tobacco in their mouth

22:39.760 --> 22:40.720
 and a certain amount of nicotine

22:40.720 --> 22:41.940
 makes it into the bloodstream,

22:41.940 --> 22:43.620
 put tobacco up their nose,

22:43.620 --> 22:45.360
 certain amount of nicotine gets into the bloodstream.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.180
 I haven't heard of people putting tobacco

22:47.180 --> 22:48.580
 in other orifices of their body,

22:48.580 --> 22:49.680
 containing mucosal tissue,

22:49.680 --> 22:51.720
 and I'm certainly not suggesting people do that,

22:51.720 --> 22:52.740
 but you get the idea

22:52.740 --> 22:54.820
 and how nicotine gets from these plants,

22:54.820 --> 22:57.500
 these dried leaves, into the bloodstream.

22:58.420 --> 23:02.260
 Burning tobacco leads to a heat-induced change

23:02.260 --> 23:04.020
 in the availability of nicotine,

23:04.020 --> 23:08.720
 and this is why smoking tobacco or vaping tobacco

23:08.720 --> 23:12.220
 simply by heating it up allows the nicotine to be liberated

23:12.220 --> 23:13.780
 and go into the bloodstream

23:13.780 --> 23:15.300
 simply by inhaling it into the lungs.

23:15.300 --> 23:18.100
 We will get back to smoking of various kinds later,

23:18.100 --> 23:20.620
 but right now let's just keep our attention

23:20.620 --> 23:24.180
 on how nicotine is pulled from these plants

23:24.180 --> 23:25.880
 and into the human body.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.660
 Now, whether by inhalation

23:27.660 --> 23:30.220
 or whether or not by placing it in contact

23:30.220 --> 23:31.740
 with the mucosal tissue of the mouth

23:31.740 --> 23:36.020
 or other mucosal-containing orifice of the body,

23:36.020 --> 23:38.380
 the nicotine then gets into the bloodstream.

23:38.380 --> 23:40.260
 And once it's in the bloodstream,

23:40.260 --> 23:41.980
 it only exerts its effects

23:41.980 --> 23:46.460
 because it binds to certain so-called nicotinic receptors.

23:46.460 --> 23:49.020
 Okay, so the nicotinic receptors

23:49.020 --> 23:51.820
 are of the acetylcholinergic variety.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.940
 I know this is a lot to think about and a lot to hear

23:53.940 --> 23:54.780
 if you haven't heard about this,

23:54.780 --> 23:56.060
 but it's actually quite simple.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.700
 Anyone can understand this.

23:57.700 --> 24:02.260
 Acetylcholin is a molecule, a chemical that is,

24:02.260 --> 24:05.720
 that's released in the brain and body,

24:05.720 --> 24:07.620
 and when it binds to receptors,

24:07.620 --> 24:09.660
 that is little parking spots on cells,

24:09.660 --> 24:11.880
 it changes the way those cells behave.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.840
 Those cells can increase their activity

24:13.840 --> 24:14.920
 and release other chemicals.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.220
 They can become electrically active.

24:16.220 --> 24:19.100
 They can do any number of different things.

24:19.100 --> 24:22.780
 When we ingest nicotine, it gets into the bloodstream,

24:22.780 --> 24:24.640
 and eventually some of that will get into the brain

24:24.640 --> 24:26.120
 and some of it gets into the body.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.660
 And in both the brain and body,

24:27.660 --> 24:30.740
 there are these so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

24:30.740 --> 24:34.300
 Now the so-called family, and indeed they are a family,

24:34.300 --> 24:36.860
 this is how we refer to groups of receptors

24:36.860 --> 24:40.780
 of related design and genetic background, just like humans.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.620
 You have a family of these acetylcholine receptors

24:43.620 --> 24:44.940
 that are of the nicotinic variety.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.900
 So, you know, maybe on one street in your neighborhood,

24:46.900 --> 24:48.460
 you know the Joneses on another street,

24:48.460 --> 24:49.780
 you know the Chows on another street.

24:49.780 --> 24:50.980
 Well, in your body,

24:50.980 --> 24:53.160
 you have the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,

24:53.160 --> 24:54.000
 and then you have the so-called

24:54.000 --> 24:56.140
 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

24:56.140 --> 24:57.200
 Today it's really simple.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.020
 Nicotine only binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

25:00.020 --> 25:01.660
 and there are a bunch of different ones

25:01.660 --> 25:03.220
 on a bunch of different tissues.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.980
 And the differences in those receptors

25:05.980 --> 25:08.700
 dictate what sorts of effects

25:08.700 --> 25:11.420
 the nicotine will have on those tissues.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.060
 So let's talk about what those effects are

25:13.060 --> 25:15.520
 and let's do that by dividing the effects of nicotine

25:15.520 --> 25:17.120
 into effects on the brain,

25:17.120 --> 25:19.660
 so everything from the neck up and on the body,

25:19.660 --> 25:22.140
 the so-called central nervous system and the periphery.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.560
 Although I want to point out that your spinal cord

25:23.560 --> 25:24.780
 is part of the central nervous system,

25:24.780 --> 25:27.380
 so in fairness to the reality,

25:27.380 --> 25:30.400
 your brain and spinal cord are all central nervous system,

25:30.400 --> 25:32.900
 everything else is considered the periphery.

25:32.900 --> 25:33.940
 Now, there are a lot of different

25:33.940 --> 25:35.740
 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,

25:35.740 --> 25:37.300
 but for those of you that want to know,

25:37.300 --> 25:38.340
 you have aficionados,

25:38.340 --> 25:40.780
 or if you're ultra curious about this,

25:40.780 --> 25:43.540
 the main effects of nicotine in the brain

25:43.540 --> 25:46.300
 are mediated by nicotine binding

25:46.300 --> 25:49.820
 to the so-called alpha-4 beta-2 receptor,

25:49.820 --> 25:52.140
 alpha-4 beta-2 receptor.

25:52.140 --> 25:54.560
 Even if you don't care about receptor subtypes,

25:54.560 --> 25:56.420
 that's going to come up later when we discuss

25:56.420 --> 25:59.380
 why nicotine suppresses appetite.

25:59.380 --> 26:00.680
 In fact, one of the major reasons

26:00.680 --> 26:02.980
 why people don't want to quit smoking

26:02.980 --> 26:06.540
 or they quit smoking or another form of ingesting nicotine

26:06.540 --> 26:10.140
 and then they relapse, they go back to smoking

26:10.140 --> 26:12.040
 or ingesting nicotine in some other way

26:12.040 --> 26:15.860
 is because indeed nicotine will increase metabolism

26:15.860 --> 26:18.180
 and reduce hunger in large part

26:18.180 --> 26:20.840
 by binding to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor

26:20.840 --> 26:21.920
 in a particular area of the brain.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.060
 We're going to return to that in a little bit,

26:23.060 --> 26:26.020
 but if you've ever heard that nicotine kills the appetite,

26:26.020 --> 26:27.440
 indeed it does.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.060
 It's not the behavior of smoking itself,

26:29.060 --> 26:30.700
 it's not because you always have a cigarette in your mouth

26:30.700 --> 26:32.020
 that you're not eating more food,

26:32.020 --> 26:34.220
 although I suppose that might be a minor effect.

26:34.220 --> 26:37.480
 There are direct effects of nicotine on both appetite,

26:37.480 --> 26:38.900
 that is it reduces appetite,

26:38.900 --> 26:40.700
 and direct effects on metabolism,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.320
 that is it increases metabolism

26:42.320 --> 26:43.940
 through its effects on some other areas

26:43.940 --> 26:45.860
 of the brain and body we'll talk about in a moment.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.220
 And within the brain,

26:47.220 --> 26:51.220
 nicotine binds to this alpha-4 beta-2 receptor

26:51.220 --> 26:52.900
 in various locations in the brain.

26:52.900 --> 26:55.180
 And there are three and maybe a fourth

26:55.180 --> 26:58.420
 that we'll talk about neurochemical effects of nicotine

26:58.420 --> 26:59.540
 after you ingest it.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.940
 First things first, when you ingest nicotine

27:01.940 --> 27:05.340
 by smoking nicotine containing tobacco,

27:05.340 --> 27:09.820
 or if you place tobacco in contact with the mucosal lining

27:09.820 --> 27:12.140
 of the nasal passages of the mouth,

27:12.140 --> 27:15.380
 it takes about two to 15 minutes

27:15.380 --> 27:16.840
 for that nicotine to enter the bloodstream.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.860
 Smoking hits the bloodstream faster,

27:18.860 --> 27:21.360
 vaping even faster, I should mention,

27:21.360 --> 27:22.780
 for a variety of reasons,

27:22.780 --> 27:26.100
 and placing tobacco directly in contact

27:26.100 --> 27:28.740
 with the mucosal lining is going to be the slowest.

27:28.740 --> 27:29.940
 Now, as I mentioned before,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.420
 nicotine gets into the bloodstream,

27:31.420 --> 27:33.420
 and then because nicotine can pass

27:33.420 --> 27:36.620
 through the so-called blood-brain barrier, the BBB,

27:36.620 --> 27:39.060
 which is basically a fence around the brain,

27:39.060 --> 27:41.300
 because it can pass through the blood-brain barrier,

27:41.300 --> 27:43.540
 it's going to have very rapid effects on the brain

27:43.540 --> 27:46.960
 in these four major categories of neurochemicals

27:46.960 --> 27:48.820
 and neural circuits.

27:48.820 --> 27:50.380
 The first of those categories,

27:50.380 --> 27:52.060
 and this is a very important one,

27:52.060 --> 27:53.660
 this is one that was brought up in the episode

27:53.660 --> 27:55.100
 on dopamine motivation and drive,

27:55.100 --> 27:57.180
 and I think not just all scientists,

27:57.180 --> 28:00.200
 but all human beings should know that within their brain,

28:00.200 --> 28:05.200
 they have what is called the mesolimbic reward pathway.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.580
 The mesolimbic reward pathway,

28:06.580 --> 28:09.320
 if you just want to call it the dopamine reward pathway,

28:09.320 --> 28:11.060
 is, as the name suggests,

28:11.060 --> 28:12.940
 a set of connections between a brain area

28:12.940 --> 28:14.460
 called the ventral tegmental area.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.460
 You don't have to remember the names of these things,

28:16.460 --> 28:18.740
 of course, but if you want to, that's fine too.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.180
 The ventral tegmental area, or VTA,

28:21.180 --> 28:24.860
 connects to another area called the nucleus accumbens.

28:24.860 --> 28:26.400
 Now, here's what's very important.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.380
 Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine

28:30.380 --> 28:31.660
 from the nucleus accumbens.

28:31.660 --> 28:34.720
 This is what gives nicotine its rewarding properties.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.100
 It increases motivation.

28:36.100 --> 28:39.220
 It tends to give a not so subtle,

28:39.220 --> 28:42.860
 but very transient increase in feelings of wellbeing

28:42.860 --> 28:44.740
 and alertness and motivation,

28:44.740 --> 28:46.760
 and that's because of the increase in dopamine

28:46.760 --> 28:50.560
 caused by nicotine directly within the nucleus accumbens.

28:52.020 --> 28:55.260
 Nicotine also triggers the release of certain neurochemicals

28:55.260 --> 28:57.500
 from the ventral tegmental area itself,

28:57.500 --> 28:59.820
 and those impinge on nucleus accumbens

28:59.820 --> 29:02.180
 and increase dopamine levels further.

29:02.180 --> 29:04.560
 This is what makes the rewarding properties,

29:04.560 --> 29:07.180
 or sometimes referred to as the reinforcing properties

29:07.180 --> 29:08.700
 of nicotine, so powerful.

29:08.700 --> 29:13.080
 This is why so many billions of people ingest nicotine

29:13.080 --> 29:14.100
 in one form or another.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.100
 It's also why nicotine is so hard to quit,

29:18.100 --> 29:20.820
 because there's a potent increase in dopamine

29:20.820 --> 29:23.080
 from multiple neural circuit pathways

29:23.080 --> 29:26.300
 within this mesolimbic reward circuitry.

29:26.300 --> 29:29.020
 Now, within the mesolimbic reward circuitry,

29:29.020 --> 29:29.940
 there's an interesting feature.

29:29.940 --> 29:32.020
 There are accelerators that essentially

29:32.020 --> 29:34.860
 push out more dopamine, get more dopamine released,

29:34.860 --> 29:37.780
 and there are breaks of the so-called GABAergic variety.

29:37.780 --> 29:39.920
 GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.040
 You don't need to know too much about it

29:41.040 --> 29:45.620
 to just understand that nicotine both increases dopamine,

29:45.620 --> 29:49.340
 but also decreases the activity of GABA,

29:49.340 --> 29:52.720
 and so this is like pushing on the accelerator for dopamine,

29:52.720 --> 29:54.660
 but also removing the break.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.920
 So there's a two-pronged effect of nicotine

29:57.920 --> 30:01.260
 on reinforcement reward dopamine-related pathways,

30:01.260 --> 30:03.940
 the feel-good motivation pathways,

30:03.940 --> 30:06.400
 and that is an increase in dopamine

30:06.400 --> 30:08.500
 and a decrease in GABA,

30:08.500 --> 30:09.860
 and again, that's all mediated

30:09.860 --> 30:11.340
 through this mesolimbic reward pathway

30:11.340 --> 30:13.260
 involving the ventral tegmental area

30:13.260 --> 30:14.660
 and the nucleus accumbens.

30:14.660 --> 30:15.860
 So if you can conceptualize

30:15.860 --> 30:18.260
 even just 5% of what I just told you,

30:18.260 --> 30:19.540
 or even if you can just remember,

30:19.540 --> 30:21.260
 nicotine increases dopamine,

30:21.260 --> 30:22.620
 and that's why it feels so good.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.660
 It makes you want more of it.

30:24.660 --> 30:27.340
 You will have everything you need to know in mind

30:27.340 --> 30:32.340
 in order to understand both why nicotine is so highly used

30:32.700 --> 30:35.220
 and indeed abused, why it's so hard to quit,

30:35.220 --> 30:36.780
 and that will point to avenues

30:36.780 --> 30:39.120
 as to how to quit or reduce intake,

30:39.120 --> 30:42.200
 and it also points to how nicotine can actually be used

30:42.200 --> 30:45.700
 in an antidepressant way should you choose,

30:45.700 --> 30:48.220
 and we will talk about what the various criteria are

30:48.220 --> 30:49.380
 for choosing that,

30:49.380 --> 30:53.060
 but just understand nicotine increases motivation,

30:53.060 --> 30:55.700
 it decreases negative feelings of mood,

30:55.700 --> 30:58.460
 it increases positive feelings of mood and motivation.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.700
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

31:00.700 --> 31:02.780
 I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,

31:02.780 --> 31:05.980
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

31:05.980 --> 31:08.260
 Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,

31:08.260 --> 31:10.720
 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink

31:10.720 --> 31:13.780
 that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.

31:13.780 --> 31:16.500
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,

31:16.500 --> 31:18.940
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.540
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

31:20.540 --> 31:23.500
 and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day

31:23.500 --> 31:26.380
 is that it supplies total foundational coverage

31:26.380 --> 31:27.780
 of my vitamin mineral needs,

31:27.780 --> 31:30.300
 and it supplies important nutrients

31:30.300 --> 31:32.260
 that I need to support my gut microbiome.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.020
 The gut microbiome, as many of you know,

31:34.020 --> 31:35.120
 supports the immune system.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.140
 It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,

31:37.140 --> 31:38.660
 which is vital for mood,

31:38.660 --> 31:40.780
 for energy levels, for regulating focus,

31:40.780 --> 31:42.620
 and many other features of our mental health

31:42.620 --> 31:44.940
 and physical health that impact our daily performance

31:44.940 --> 31:46.560
 and high performance in any endeavors

31:46.560 --> 31:47.960
 we might be involved in.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.340
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

31:49.340 --> 31:52.020
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

31:52.020 --> 31:53.620
 and claim a special offer.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.300
 They're giving away five free travel packs

31:55.300 --> 31:59.180
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order,

31:59.180 --> 32:01.400
 and of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital

32:01.400 --> 32:03.440
 for all sorts of things like hormone health

32:03.440 --> 32:05.860
 and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health

32:05.860 --> 32:07.040
 and calcium regulation.

32:07.040 --> 32:10.260
 Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

32:10.260 --> 32:11.780
 to claim that special offer.

32:11.780 --> 32:14.460
 The second major effect that nicotine has in the brain

32:14.460 --> 32:17.100
 is that it increases acetylcholine.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.940
 Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator

32:18.940 --> 32:20.520
 that exists in you and me.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.540
 It is released from multiple sites in the brain,

32:23.540 --> 32:27.420
 and the two major sites are the nucleus basalis.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.740
 So these are a collection of neurons

32:29.740 --> 32:32.140
 in the front and base of your brain

32:32.140 --> 32:33.980
 and from some brain stem areas,

32:33.980 --> 32:35.980
 and there are a bunch of different ones back there

32:35.980 --> 32:37.900
 in your brain stem, which is indeed in the back,

32:37.900 --> 32:39.760
 that release acetylcholine.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.400
 That include the locus coeruleus as kind of a minor site,

32:42.400 --> 32:44.300
 the pedunculopontine nucleus.

32:44.300 --> 32:46.740
 There are a bunch of these different areas,

32:46.740 --> 32:48.220
 the parabigeminal nucleus.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.800
 There are a bunch of these things back there.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.260
 We don't have to go into all the names,

32:51.260 --> 32:53.140
 but just understand that there are little pockets

32:53.140 --> 32:55.920
 of neurons, nerve cells, located in the front and the back

32:55.920 --> 32:57.500
 and to some extent in the middle of your brain,

32:57.500 --> 32:59.400
 but really in the front and the back of your brain

32:59.400 --> 33:02.300
 that can serve two major roles.

33:02.300 --> 33:03.980
 Here they are.

33:03.980 --> 33:06.500
 Acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis

33:06.500 --> 33:09.580
 leads to a sort of spotlighting or highlighting

33:09.580 --> 33:11.780
 of particular neural circuits in the brain.

33:11.780 --> 33:12.620
 What do I mean by this?

33:12.620 --> 33:14.820
 Well, let's say you're working on a puzzle.

33:14.820 --> 33:15.900
 Let's say it's a cognitive puzzle.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.540
 Maybe you're doing a word puzzle,

33:17.540 --> 33:19.500
 or nowadays I've heard of this wordle thing.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.980
 I'm on Twitter and people are always posting

33:20.980 --> 33:22.880
 their wordle thing, and I have no idea what it is,

33:22.880 --> 33:24.580
 but I'm guessing it's some sort of puzzle.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.040
 I'm guessing it's like a crossword puzzle,

33:26.040 --> 33:27.780
 and here, if I'm wrong, I don't know, educate me.

33:27.780 --> 33:28.620
 Tell me what wordle is.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.940
 Somebody put it in the comments

33:29.940 --> 33:32.180
 and tell me if I should play it or not.

33:32.180 --> 33:33.020
 Here's the deal.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.860
 When acetylcholine is released from nucleus basalis,

33:36.860 --> 33:39.440
 the neurons are there in the base of the brain,

33:39.440 --> 33:41.020
 but they extend axons,

33:41.020 --> 33:43.100
 which are like little wires elsewhere in the brain,

33:43.100 --> 33:45.020
 and when acetylcholine is released,

33:45.020 --> 33:47.700
 it tends to be released at particular locations in the brain

33:47.700 --> 33:49.580
 that are associated with whatever activity

33:49.580 --> 33:50.500
 we happen to be doing.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.340
 So if I'm doing wordle,

33:52.340 --> 33:54.220
 here I'm talking about it as if I've ever done it,

33:54.220 --> 33:56.020
 doing a crossword puzzle or wordle,

33:56.020 --> 33:57.300
 well, the neurons that we're involved in

33:57.300 --> 33:59.060
 trying to figure out the solution to that wordle

33:59.060 --> 34:00.900
 or crossword puzzle are active,

34:00.900 --> 34:03.640
 and then acetylcholine is released from the little wires,

34:03.640 --> 34:06.540
 the little endings of these cells in nucleus basalis,

34:06.540 --> 34:09.460
 and all of a sudden, those neural circuits get a boost.

34:09.460 --> 34:12.660
 They become more active, and believe it or not,

34:12.660 --> 34:14.620
 our ability to perform that crossword puzzle,

34:14.620 --> 34:17.780
 or at least focus on that wordle or crossword puzzle,

34:17.780 --> 34:19.020
 gets enhanced.

34:19.020 --> 34:20.400
 It literally increases.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.780
 Our attention for that and not anything else is enhanced.

34:23.780 --> 34:27.820
 So it's literally like a neurochemical attentional spotlight.

34:27.820 --> 34:31.020
 Nicotine increases acetylcholine and thereby

34:31.020 --> 34:33.440
 focus and concentration and mental performance,

34:33.440 --> 34:36.020
 not by changing the neural circuits

34:36.020 --> 34:37.740
 that are activated per se,

34:37.740 --> 34:42.100
 but rather by making more acetylcholine available

34:42.100 --> 34:43.580
 at those release sites.

34:43.580 --> 34:46.320
 So it's as if the spotlighter got more intense.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.380
 The highlighter is more intense than it would be otherwise.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.840
 And I should also mention

34:50.840 --> 34:52.820
 because of the so-called pharmacokinetics,

34:52.820 --> 34:55.940
 the time course in which nicotine has its effects,

34:55.940 --> 34:57.400
 which are pretty short-lived,

34:57.400 --> 34:58.700
 talk about those in a moment,

34:58.700 --> 35:02.300
 this enhancement in cognitive performance and attention

35:02.300 --> 35:03.380
 is going to be very transient,

35:03.380 --> 35:06.820
 probably on the order of about 30, maybe 45 minutes.

35:06.820 --> 35:07.980
 The half-life of nicotine,

35:07.980 --> 35:09.180
 depending on how it's ingested

35:09.180 --> 35:10.380
 and whether or not you have food in the gut

35:10.380 --> 35:12.060
 and what else is in the bloodstream, et cetera,

35:12.060 --> 35:14.460
 it's going to be anywhere from one to two hours.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.340
 But typically the effects of nicotine will come on

35:16.340 --> 35:18.940
 in about two to 15 minutes, as I mentioned before,

35:18.940 --> 35:22.440
 and then will last anywhere from about 30 to 45 minutes.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.000
 This is why in the old days,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.420
 and still to some extent in certain areas of the world,

35:26.420 --> 35:28.220
 but less so in the United States

35:28.220 --> 35:30.100
 and certainly in Europe as well,

35:30.100 --> 35:32.660
 we don't see quite as many people smoking cigarettes

35:32.660 --> 35:34.860
 for reasons we can discuss later,

35:34.860 --> 35:37.120
 but you would see these chain smokers

35:37.120 --> 35:39.780
 who are trying to maintain constant levels

35:39.780 --> 35:41.980
 of nicotine in their brain and bloodstream.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.580
 Now, perhaps they didn't know

35:43.580 --> 35:46.340
 that nicotine has this one to two hour half-life,

35:46.340 --> 35:48.700
 but they could sense, no doubt,

35:48.700 --> 35:50.960
 the cognitive and the physical effects of nicotine,

35:50.960 --> 35:52.840
 including this cognitive enhancement effect

35:52.840 --> 35:55.240
 and highlighting of the neural circuits effect.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.580
 And they would notice, they would smoke a cigarette,

35:57.580 --> 36:00.140
 and then for the next five to 45 minutes

36:00.140 --> 36:01.060
 have heightened focus,

36:01.060 --> 36:02.100
 and then it would start to drop off,

36:02.100 --> 36:03.140
 so they smoke another cigarette.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.360
 So in other words, they're trying to maintain

36:05.360 --> 36:07.320
 a constant level of nicotine

36:07.320 --> 36:09.300
 for whatever activities they needed to perform.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.760
 Obviously chain smoking,

36:10.760 --> 36:13.560
 because of the terrible effects of smoking,

36:13.560 --> 36:14.780
 I'll talk about those terrible effects,

36:14.780 --> 36:16.700
 but I'm sure you've heard of them before,

36:16.700 --> 36:20.660
 cancer, depletion of just about every organ and body tissue

36:20.660 --> 36:22.780
 to the point that it can actually be measured

36:22.780 --> 36:24.660
 how many years of your life you're peeling off

36:24.660 --> 36:27.340
 in terms of lifespan and healthspan by smoking.

36:27.340 --> 36:31.380
 Well, the terrible effects of smoking are indisputable,

36:31.380 --> 36:35.180
 but the positive effects of nicotine on this circuitry

36:35.180 --> 36:37.780
 are part of the reason why people would chain smoke

36:37.780 --> 36:38.960
 in the first place,

36:38.960 --> 36:41.700
 rather than get one big peak of concentration and focus

36:41.700 --> 36:44.500
 and then just let it disappear after 45 minutes.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.840
 Okay, so what we have is a scenario

36:46.840 --> 36:49.540
 where dopamine is going up in the mesolimbic pathway.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.380
 That's why smoking or ingesting nicotine in any other way

36:52.380 --> 36:54.660
 feels good and makes us feel motivated.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.220
 And then the increase in acetylcholine,

36:56.220 --> 36:58.580
 especially from nucleus basalis in the front of the brain

36:58.580 --> 37:01.340
 is the reason why it can increase our ability

37:01.340 --> 37:04.220
 to focus on particular types of endeavors,

37:04.220 --> 37:05.820
 particular mental work that we're doing,

37:05.820 --> 37:07.660
 or maybe even particular physical work.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.780
 Although I should mention anytime I'm pairing

37:09.780 --> 37:11.800
 the words nicotine and physical work,

37:11.800 --> 37:13.700
 it's obvious that because of the ways

37:13.700 --> 37:16.200
 that smoking impairs lung function,

37:16.200 --> 37:18.540
 those two things really run counter to one another.

37:18.540 --> 37:21.340
 In other words, if you are thinking about ingesting nicotine

37:21.340 --> 37:22.380
 through smoking or vaping

37:22.380 --> 37:25.140
 in order to improve physical performance,

37:25.140 --> 37:26.400
 that's a terrible idea.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
 The logic isn't there

37:27.400 --> 37:29.220
 and the health detriments are certainly there.

37:29.220 --> 37:32.640
 The third neurochemical pathway that's strongly activated

37:32.640 --> 37:35.060
 when nicotine is brought into the central nervous system,

37:35.060 --> 37:39.300
 into the brain is epinephrine or in particular norepinephrine

37:39.300 --> 37:40.600
 which is related to epinephrine.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.180
 Now, earlier I said epinephrine is the same as adrenaline.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.260
 That's still true.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.280
 Norepinephrine is closely related to epinephrine.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.420
 And for today's discussion,

37:47.420 --> 37:48.860
 we're going to use them interchangeably.

37:48.860 --> 37:51.160
 Although I realize as I say that,

37:51.160 --> 37:53.100
 that the medical students and some biology students

37:53.100 --> 37:54.860
 are probably going to have a minor seizure

37:54.860 --> 37:57.060
 when I lump norepinephrine and epinephrine.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.980
 I don't do that to be too much of a lumper.

37:59.980 --> 38:01.820
 In science, we talk about lumpers and splitters.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.040
 Lumpers are people that like to oversimplify a little bit.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.940
 Splitters are people that really like to detail.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.860
 You'll see a lot of splitters on social media

38:07.860 --> 38:08.700
 from time to time.

38:08.700 --> 38:09.620
 They'll say, wait, you know,

38:09.620 --> 38:13.060
 you didn't mention the alpha-2 beta-6 receptor subunit.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.580
 Okay, look, I get it.

38:14.580 --> 38:17.100
 And I am all for having splitters in the room.

38:17.100 --> 38:18.900
 But for sake of today's discussion

38:18.900 --> 38:21.980
 and for ease of digestibility of some of this,

38:21.980 --> 38:24.100
 just want to point out that norepinephrine, epinephrine,

38:24.100 --> 38:26.340
 and adrenaline, I'm going to treat as a common pool

38:26.340 --> 38:29.100
 of similar, in fact, very similar molecules

38:29.100 --> 38:31.700
 that all have the same net effect,

38:31.700 --> 38:33.200
 at least in the context of this discussion.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.340
 And that's to increase levels of alertness,

38:35.340 --> 38:37.020
 energy, and arousal.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.580
 And the way that nicotine accomplishes those increases

38:39.580 --> 38:42.860
 in alertness and arousal and energy within the brain

38:42.860 --> 38:44.620
 is by triggering the release of norepinephrine

38:44.620 --> 38:46.380
 from a little cluster of neurons in the back of the brain

38:46.380 --> 38:49.900
 called locus coeruleus, tiny cluster of neurons

38:49.900 --> 38:52.580
 that offers up, or I should say has,

38:52.580 --> 38:54.980
 because they're always there from birth,

38:54.980 --> 38:58.040
 has these little wires, these axons that extend many,

38:58.040 --> 38:59.780
 many places in the brain, not every place,

38:59.780 --> 39:02.620
 but virtually every place and can sprinkler the brain

39:02.620 --> 39:03.980
 with norepinephrine and essentially serve

39:03.980 --> 39:07.260
 as a wake-up signal, elevating levels of energy.

39:07.260 --> 39:10.020
 And when that combines with the acetylcholine

39:10.020 --> 39:12.140
 from nucleus basalis,

39:12.140 --> 39:14.020
 which causes attentional spotlighting,

39:14.020 --> 39:16.500
 increases in concentration and focus,

39:16.500 --> 39:19.300
 and with the feel-good properties of dopamine

39:19.300 --> 39:21.620
 and the motivating properties of dopamine released

39:21.620 --> 39:23.700
 from the mesolimbic reward pathway,

39:23.700 --> 39:25.580
 now you can start to get a picture

39:25.580 --> 39:30.140
 of why nicotine is such a powerful molecule.

39:30.140 --> 39:32.020
 It's making people feel motivated and good.

39:32.020 --> 39:33.540
 It's making people feel focused

39:33.540 --> 39:36.300
 and it makes people feel alert

39:36.300 --> 39:38.460
 when they would otherwise feel a little bit sleepy.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.400
 So this is a really powerful compound.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.020
 In fact, going back to our earlier discussion

39:43.020 --> 39:45.120
 about focus and some tools for focus,

39:45.120 --> 39:46.500
 and I encourage you, if you're interested,

39:46.500 --> 39:48.040
 to please check out the episode on focus.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.740
 There are a number of different tools

39:49.740 --> 39:51.660
 and protocols there to increase focus,

39:51.660 --> 39:56.500
 but here we're talking about one molecule, nicotine,

39:56.500 --> 39:59.180
 found in plants like tomatoes and potatoes

39:59.180 --> 40:00.760
 and the tobacco plant,

40:00.760 --> 40:03.220
 and it can be synthesized in a laboratory

40:03.220 --> 40:07.320
 and ingested through a patch or a gum or even a pill

40:07.320 --> 40:09.440
 or a toothpick dipped in nicotine.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.980
 One molecule that can trigger activation

40:12.980 --> 40:16.540
 of all the circuits for focus and motivation

40:17.460 --> 40:19.100
 in one fell swoop.

40:19.100 --> 40:20.660
 That is remarkable.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.140
 That is absolutely remarkable.

40:22.140 --> 40:23.060
 And here we haven't even touched

40:23.060 --> 40:25.160
 on some of the psychological components of focus, right?

40:25.160 --> 40:26.600
 Whether or not we're interested in something,

40:26.600 --> 40:28.860
 whether or not we're excited about it or not.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.340
 This is a very, very powerful system.

40:31.340 --> 40:32.980
 So powerful, in fact,

40:32.980 --> 40:35.980
 that I think we can really place nicotine right up there

40:35.980 --> 40:38.620
 at the top, right next to caffeine

40:38.620 --> 40:42.780
 as the molecule that has fundamentally changed

40:42.780 --> 40:46.780
 human evolution, human consciousness, and human experience.

40:46.780 --> 40:49.340
 Even if you're somebody who's never ingested nicotine,

40:49.340 --> 40:50.780
 this absolutely has to be true

40:50.780 --> 40:52.700
 because you have these nicotinic receptors,

40:52.700 --> 40:55.540
 which is to say that acetylcholine that's naturally released

40:55.540 --> 40:58.900
 without any external trigger within your brain and body,

40:58.900 --> 41:01.140
 or I should say without any trigger from nicotine

41:01.140 --> 41:02.300
 in particular,

41:02.300 --> 41:05.420
 is binding these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

41:05.420 --> 41:07.700
 and is creating these effects in your brain and body.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.460
 It's just absolutely staggering.

41:09.460 --> 41:12.180
 Now, earlier I mentioned the appetite suppressing

41:12.180 --> 41:15.500
 and indeed metabolism increasing effects of nicotine.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.180
 And while that's a fairly niche component

41:18.180 --> 41:20.540
 of what nicotine does, I mean, it's an important one,

41:20.540 --> 41:22.260
 but it's not the major reason

41:22.260 --> 41:23.860
 why most people consume nicotine.

41:23.860 --> 41:25.920
 I'd like to take a moment and talk about that now

41:25.920 --> 41:27.460
 because we are in the brain

41:27.460 --> 41:29.500
 and we're talking about the effects of nicotine in the brain

41:29.500 --> 41:31.220
 and so it seems to me the appropriate time

41:31.220 --> 41:32.120
 to talk about this.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.500
 Now, we can have this conversation about nicotine

41:34.500 --> 41:35.700
 and appetite and metabolism

41:35.700 --> 41:38.020
 in a very simple and straightforward way.

41:38.020 --> 41:42.140
 If you'd like to learn more about the biology of metabolism

41:42.140 --> 41:44.540
 and appetite and how those things are mediated

41:44.540 --> 41:46.180
 by neural components,

41:46.180 --> 41:48.180
 so not just stuff like your liver, et cetera,

41:48.180 --> 41:49.220
 we have episodes on that,

41:49.220 --> 41:52.140
 but really the neural components of hunger and appetite.

41:52.140 --> 41:53.500
 I encourage you to check out our episode

41:53.500 --> 41:55.260
 on hunger and appetite.

41:55.260 --> 41:58.180
 But in that episode, we had a discussion

41:58.180 --> 42:00.760
 and it's one that I'll just briefly summarize now

42:00.760 --> 42:02.300
 that you have a collection of neurons

42:02.300 --> 42:04.660
 that sits right above the roof of your mouth or so

42:04.660 --> 42:06.040
 called the hypothalamus.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.540
 Hypo means below and thalamus is right above it,

42:08.540 --> 42:09.500
 hypothalamus.

42:09.500 --> 42:12.660
 So the small collection of neurons in the hypothalamus

42:12.660 --> 42:15.540
 do a number of different things related to sex behavior,

42:15.540 --> 42:19.060
 aggression, mediating the temperature of your body, et cetera,

42:19.060 --> 42:22.100
 but also appetite and suppressing appetite.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.220
 And within the hypothalamus,

42:23.220 --> 42:26.120
 there's a compact collection of these little neurons,

42:26.120 --> 42:28.980
 which are referred to as the POMC, P-O-M-C neurons.

42:28.980 --> 42:29.940
 And the name comes from the fact

42:29.940 --> 42:31.220
 that they express certain peptides

42:31.220 --> 42:32.720
 and we won't get into that now,

42:32.720 --> 42:37.020
 but the POMC neurons have a very profound impact

42:37.020 --> 42:38.620
 on whether or not you feel hungry

42:38.620 --> 42:40.980
 or whether or not you do not feel hungry,

42:40.980 --> 42:43.380
 whether or not your appetite is suppressed.

42:43.380 --> 42:45.540
 It turns out that when nicotine gets into the bloodstream

42:45.540 --> 42:46.840
 and then into the brain,

42:46.840 --> 42:51.740
 some of that nicotine binds to nicotinic alpha-4 beta-2

42:51.740 --> 42:53.820
 containing nicotinic receptors.

42:53.820 --> 42:55.180
 Again, these subunits are receptors,

42:55.180 --> 42:56.340
 but basically the nicotine binds

42:56.340 --> 42:58.020
 to one of those parking spots, parks there.

42:58.020 --> 43:00.900
 And as a consequence, these POMC, P-O-M-C neurons

43:00.900 --> 43:03.400
 increase their electrical activity

43:03.400 --> 43:05.680
 and appetite is suppressed.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.540
 And that's because the POMC neurons have outputs

43:08.540 --> 43:10.580
 to various areas of the brain and body

43:10.580 --> 43:13.940
 controlling everything from how full we feel

43:13.940 --> 43:17.380
 to whether or not our blood sugar goes up or down,

43:17.380 --> 43:18.980
 which can impact our hunger.

43:18.980 --> 43:20.140
 And believe it or not,

43:20.140 --> 43:21.320
 whether or not we have a tendency

43:21.320 --> 43:24.720
 to want to move the jaw of our mouth in order to chew food.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.780
 Yes, believe it or not,

43:25.780 --> 43:28.140
 the neural circuitry associated with appetite

43:28.140 --> 43:29.620
 and suppression of appetite

43:29.620 --> 43:32.660
 actually dictates whether or not you prefer to,

43:32.660 --> 43:35.460
 or I should say are more biased or less biased

43:35.460 --> 43:38.260
 to moving your mouth, that is chewing,

43:38.260 --> 43:40.660
 which makes perfect sense when you hear it, right?

43:40.660 --> 43:44.820
 One way to suppress appetite is to sew the jaw shut neurally

43:44.820 --> 43:47.060
 or at least make it less likely to open your mouth

43:47.060 --> 43:48.660
 and put food in it.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.180
 Actually, that reminds me of a story.

43:50.180 --> 43:52.380
 I'll just interrupt myself to tell a brief story,

43:52.380 --> 43:53.760
 that there's a famous Nobel Laureate

43:53.760 --> 43:55.180
 who won the Nobel Prize

43:55.180 --> 43:57.060
 for something totally distant from appetite,

43:57.060 --> 44:00.540
 but once turned to a friend of mine at a meeting and said,

44:00.540 --> 44:05.540
 I discovered the biological mechanism for losing weight.

44:05.540 --> 44:08.280
 And my friend said, well, of course,

44:08.280 --> 44:11.320
 it's a ingest fewer calories than you burn, right?

44:11.320 --> 44:12.260
 Calories in, calories out,

44:12.260 --> 44:13.920
 fundamental rule of thermodynamics

44:13.920 --> 44:15.480
 and basically the fundamental rule

44:15.480 --> 44:18.080
 of weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance.

44:18.080 --> 44:21.440
 And he said, no, it's actually the gene

44:21.440 --> 44:23.920
 that controls whether or not you open your mouth.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.800
 Now he was making a very nerdy joke.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.520
 So if you didn't register that as a joke,

44:27.520 --> 44:30.900
 that's about as funny as neuroscience or biology jokes get.

44:30.900 --> 44:31.800
 There are a couple of funnier ones,

44:31.800 --> 44:33.600
 but that one's kind of considered on the funnier side.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.480
 So this is why we're not considered comedians.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.400
 But the point of the matter is that

44:39.400 --> 44:42.400
 whether or not you crave or desire

44:42.400 --> 44:45.460
 or impulsively want to put things in your mouth and chew it

44:45.460 --> 44:47.740
 will actually dictate how many calories that you eat.

44:47.740 --> 44:50.460
 And so I find it remarkable and indeed important to know

44:50.460 --> 44:52.840
 that these POMC neurons are actually inhibiting

44:52.840 --> 44:55.120
 the opening and the movement of the mouth for chewing.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.220
 So when we smoke or when we ingest nicotine

44:57.220 --> 44:59.760
 in any other way, you activate these POMC neurons,

44:59.760 --> 45:01.160
 you suppress appetite, but in part,

45:01.160 --> 45:04.280
 you do that by actually limiting the impulse to chew.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.900
 Incredible, at least to me.

45:05.900 --> 45:08.080
 Now, in addition to limiting appetite

45:08.080 --> 45:11.320
 by changing one's desire to ingest food and chew it

45:11.320 --> 45:13.420
 and actual craving of food

45:13.420 --> 45:15.380
 by regulation of blood sugar, et cetera,

45:15.380 --> 45:18.520
 there do seem to be some quite direct effects

45:18.520 --> 45:21.160
 of nicotine on metabolism.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.300
 And the effects on metabolism aren't enormous.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.080
 These are increases in metabolism

45:25.080 --> 45:28.800
 that are about 2% up to about 5%.

45:28.800 --> 45:32.400
 But I want to emphasize that those are transient increases

45:32.400 --> 45:33.880
 in metabolism.

45:33.880 --> 45:37.400
 Nonetheless, people that quit smoking often find

45:37.400 --> 45:38.560
 that their appetite goes up.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.780
 They sometimes gain weight.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.400
 They sometimes do not, depending on whether or not

45:41.400 --> 45:43.480
 they offset that increase in appetite

45:43.480 --> 45:45.060
 with increased physical exercise

45:45.060 --> 45:47.280
 or with decreased food intake in other ways.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.040
 But there does seem to be this direct effect

45:49.040 --> 45:51.040
 of ingesting nicotine on metabolism,

45:51.040 --> 45:52.440
 which I find is interesting

45:52.440 --> 45:53.880
 because if you look in the literature,

45:53.880 --> 45:57.040
 one of the reasons why people are reluctant

45:57.040 --> 45:59.780
 to quit ingesting nicotine,

45:59.780 --> 46:04.000
 if for instance, they want to quit using the delivery device

46:04.000 --> 46:06.280
 to nicotine that's causing such problems for their health,

46:06.280 --> 46:08.080
 like smoking or vaping,

46:08.080 --> 46:11.340
 or whether or not they find themselves quote unquote

46:11.340 --> 46:15.440
 addicted to or have the habit of ingesting nicotine,

46:15.440 --> 46:19.040
 in part that's likely due to be the dopamine effects, right?

46:19.040 --> 46:21.140
 Because dopamine is highly reinforcing and rewarding.

46:21.140 --> 46:23.360
 It feels good, so people want to do more of it.

46:23.360 --> 46:25.560
 But it's also that for many people,

46:25.560 --> 46:27.140
 and here the data really points to the fact

46:27.140 --> 46:29.600
 that a lot of the younger female smokers

46:29.600 --> 46:32.540
 or younger female vapers,

46:32.540 --> 46:34.160
 or when I say that, of course,

46:34.160 --> 46:38.840
 I mean younger females that vape are doing that

46:38.840 --> 46:41.260
 because they like the appetite suppressing effects,

46:41.260 --> 46:43.300
 which of course opens up an entire conversation

46:43.300 --> 46:46.280
 about the sociology of body imagery, et cetera,

46:46.280 --> 46:47.920
 a topic for a future podcast.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.960
 Okay, so nicotine has certain effects on the brain

46:50.960 --> 46:54.360
 by virtue of the fact that nicotine binds

46:54.360 --> 46:56.360
 these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,

46:56.360 --> 46:58.080
 and those receptors are found on some,

46:58.080 --> 47:00.180
 but not all neural circuits within the brain.

47:00.180 --> 47:01.960
 And we talked about some of them already,

47:01.960 --> 47:04.340
 mesolimbic, the POMC neurons, et cetera.

47:04.340 --> 47:05.880
 Now, when we ingest nicotine,

47:05.880 --> 47:08.120
 it goes from the bloodstream

47:08.120 --> 47:10.720
 to all the tissues and organs of the body.

47:10.720 --> 47:11.960
 How does it do that?

47:11.960 --> 47:12.800
 I mean, amazing.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.600
 It can pass to everything, the brain, the body.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.020
 It does that because nicotine is fat soluble.

47:19.020 --> 47:20.860
 And now when anytime people hear the word fat,

47:20.860 --> 47:23.640
 they tend to think about body fat, subcutaneous fat,

47:23.640 --> 47:25.820
 or maybe they think about dietary fat.

47:25.820 --> 47:27.760
 What I mean by fat soluble in the context

47:27.760 --> 47:31.520
 of nicotine being fat soluble is that the cells

47:31.520 --> 47:35.640
 of your body have an outer layer, so-called outer membrane,

47:35.640 --> 47:37.760
 and it's made up of lipid, of fat,

47:37.760 --> 47:39.760
 very particular types of lipids in fact.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.840
 Nicotine has this remarkable ability

47:42.840 --> 47:46.640
 to move through that fatty tissue.

47:46.640 --> 47:50.320
 Not all molecules have that ability, but nicotine does.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.180
 So it can move relatively freely through the brain and body

47:53.180 --> 47:56.200
 and relatively freely from outside of cells,

47:56.200 --> 47:59.240
 extracellular space to intracellular space.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.380
 So it can get into cells.

48:00.380 --> 48:01.280
 It can do that with the brain.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.320
 We talked about those effects

48:02.320 --> 48:04.180
 and it can do that within the body.

48:04.180 --> 48:06.260
 Now, anytime we're talking about the body,

48:06.260 --> 48:07.780
 we can be talking about any number of things,

48:07.780 --> 48:10.840
 but today I'm going to refer to the periphery and the body

48:10.840 --> 48:11.840
 in more or less the same way,

48:11.840 --> 48:15.700
 but keep in mind in the back of your head, pun intended,

48:16.600 --> 48:20.080
 you have your brain, your eyes, and the spinal cord,

48:20.080 --> 48:22.720
 and those three things make up your central nervous system.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.700
 The peripheral nervous system and the periphery,

48:24.700 --> 48:26.080
 which is the rest of your body,

48:26.080 --> 48:27.840
 that contain your organs and so forth

48:27.840 --> 48:29.540
 outside of the nervous system,

48:29.540 --> 48:31.700
 things like your liver and your stomach, et cetera,

48:31.700 --> 48:33.540
 that's what we're going to talk about now,

48:33.540 --> 48:36.220
 because nicotine has profound effects

48:36.220 --> 48:38.760
 on the organs of the body that are separate from,

48:38.760 --> 48:41.560
 but that occur in parallel at the same time

48:41.560 --> 48:44.080
 as the effects of nicotine on the brain.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.040
 So let's talk about what some of those effects are.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.760
 When nicotine makes it into the bloodstream,

48:47.760 --> 48:50.080
 again, within two to 15 minutes of ingesting it,

48:50.080 --> 48:53.080
 depending on the delivery device,

48:53.080 --> 48:55.640
 your heart rate will increase,

48:55.640 --> 48:57.520
 blood pressure will increase,

48:57.520 --> 49:00.080
 and the contractibility of the heart tissue

49:00.080 --> 49:01.880
 will actually increase.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.720
 So what that essentially speaks to

49:04.720 --> 49:07.160
 is an increase in so-called sympathetic tone.

49:07.160 --> 49:09.640
 And when I say that, I don't mean an increase in sympathy

49:09.640 --> 49:11.440
 for others of the emotional sort.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.720
 What I mean is an increase in the sympathetic activity

49:15.720 --> 49:18.020
 of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,

49:18.020 --> 49:21.560
 which is a real mouthful and mindful of ideas,

49:21.560 --> 49:24.760
 but all you need to know is that it's a generalized system

49:24.760 --> 49:28.600
 that increases levels of alertness and physical readiness.

49:28.600 --> 49:29.800
 So it makes you ready for action,

49:29.800 --> 49:31.520
 makes you ready for thought.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.300
 It's balanced by a whole other system

49:33.300 --> 49:35.200
 called the parasympathetic nervous system,

49:35.200 --> 49:38.040
 which is basically the so-called rest and digest system,

49:38.040 --> 49:40.600
 which is a system of neurons and organs, et cetera,

49:40.600 --> 49:43.080
 that put your body and your brain into a state

49:43.080 --> 49:45.160
 of not being able to think clearly,

49:45.160 --> 49:46.960
 to digest and to fall asleep.

49:46.960 --> 49:50.160
 Okay, so nicotine increases heart rate, blood pressure,

49:50.160 --> 49:51.560
 and contractibility of the heart.

49:51.560 --> 49:54.560
 So it's going to cause more blood flow in theory,

49:54.560 --> 49:58.040
 although it also tends to constrict blood vessels

49:58.040 --> 49:59.640
 in many locations in the body.

49:59.640 --> 50:03.080
 This explains the decrease in penile girth effect

50:03.080 --> 50:04.520
 of nicotine, in particular,

50:04.520 --> 50:07.300
 nicotine ingested by smoking or vaping.

50:07.300 --> 50:11.540
 That's right, smoking and vaping reduces penis size,

50:11.540 --> 50:14.720
 and also will have damaging effects

50:14.720 --> 50:18.160
 on the bloodlining endothelial tissue.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.720
 So over time, it actually is impairing blood's ability

50:20.720 --> 50:23.240
 to get to the penis chronically,

50:23.240 --> 50:25.180
 as well as to other organs of the body.

50:25.180 --> 50:27.800
 But when people ingest nicotine acutely,

50:27.800 --> 50:30.280
 and let's say they do that by Nicorette patch

50:30.280 --> 50:32.420
 or by toothpick dipped in nicotine,

50:32.420 --> 50:34.440
 it will have some of these same effects.

50:34.440 --> 50:37.420
 But when not smoking tobacco,

50:37.420 --> 50:39.260
 when bringing nicotine into the bloodstream

50:39.260 --> 50:40.800
 through other mechanisms,

50:40.800 --> 50:42.580
 many, if not all of the disruption

50:42.580 --> 50:46.000
 of the endothelial cell function can be bypassed.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.340
 But the effects on penile girth,

50:49.340 --> 50:52.040
 the effects on reducing blood flow to various tissues

50:52.040 --> 50:55.340
 is still present during the effects of nicotine,

50:55.340 --> 50:57.520
 which as I mentioned, last about one to two hours.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.200
 The half-life is about one to two hours,

50:59.200 --> 51:00.780
 depending on the number of factors.

51:00.780 --> 51:03.120
 Not interesting for today's discussion.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.460
 So when nicotine gets into the bloodstream,

51:05.460 --> 51:06.840
 it's making us more alert.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.800
 It's preparing our body for readiness.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.200
 The heart is pumping harder.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.060
 Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,

51:13.060 --> 51:14.740
 is released from the adrenal glands,

51:14.740 --> 51:16.840
 which ride atop our kidneys.

51:16.840 --> 51:20.720
 So everything is pointed toward creating more readiness

51:20.720 --> 51:22.880
 to move, more readiness to think.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.240
 And again, this is happening in parallel

51:24.240 --> 51:26.200
 with all the effects of neurochemistry

51:26.200 --> 51:27.160
 that are happening with the brain

51:27.160 --> 51:29.700
 that we talked about a few minutes ago.

51:29.700 --> 51:31.400
 And what's interesting about nicotine

51:31.400 --> 51:34.460
 is that while it causes this global increase in readiness

51:34.460 --> 51:37.200
 and alertness and attention and mood, et cetera,

51:37.200 --> 51:42.000
 it also has the effect of somewhat relaxing skeletal muscle.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.480
 Now that might seem counterintuitive

51:43.480 --> 51:45.600
 to those of you out there that already know,

51:45.600 --> 51:47.120
 what I'm about to tell the rest of you

51:47.120 --> 51:49.520
 who didn't know it previously,

51:49.520 --> 51:53.200
 that your muscles are able to contract

51:53.200 --> 51:56.520
 because of the effects of acetylcholine

51:56.520 --> 51:59.680
 released from neurons in your spinal cord

51:59.680 --> 52:02.400
 that spit out acetylcholine onto the muscle

52:02.400 --> 52:04.260
 and bind to what?

52:04.260 --> 52:07.840
 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, put into plain English,

52:07.840 --> 52:10.500
 nicotinic receptors are also the ways

52:10.500 --> 52:12.720
 in which your muscles can get activated.

52:12.720 --> 52:15.280
 So therefore, why would it be that increasing nicotine

52:15.280 --> 52:17.960
 would cause relaxation of the muscles?

52:17.960 --> 52:19.920
 And that has to do with some of the neural circuits

52:19.920 --> 52:21.360
 that are upstream of the muscles.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.480
 And it has to do with a little bit

52:22.480 --> 52:24.240
 of how the autonomic nervous system

52:24.240 --> 52:26.500
 is arranged in terms of which receptors go where.

52:26.500 --> 52:30.080
 A topic and kind of rabbit hole of conversation,

52:30.080 --> 52:31.340
 far too deep for right now,

52:31.340 --> 52:32.920
 at least in the context of this already

52:32.920 --> 52:35.900
 somewhat detailed discussion of the effects of nicotine.

52:35.900 --> 52:37.780
 But if we were to zoom out

52:37.780 --> 52:39.760
 and just think about the effects of nicotine,

52:39.760 --> 52:41.480
 we now have a very clear picture.

52:43.020 --> 52:45.680
 Reward pathways are turned on, attention is turned on,

52:45.680 --> 52:47.560
 alertness is turned on.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.920
 You feel better than you felt a few minutes ago.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.560
 Your blood pressure is up.

52:52.560 --> 52:54.560
 Your heart rate is up.

52:54.560 --> 52:59.440
 Your preparedness for thinking is elevated as well.

52:59.440 --> 53:02.560
 And yet your body is somewhat relaxed.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.040
 That's a very interesting state of mind and body.

53:06.040 --> 53:11.040
 Interesting because it's somewhat ideal for cognitive work.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.560
 If you were going to sit down and work on a book,

53:13.560 --> 53:14.400
 or you're going to sit down

53:14.400 --> 53:16.300
 and try and figure out a hard math problem,

53:16.300 --> 53:17.340
 or you're going to write a letter

53:17.340 --> 53:19.080
 that's been really challenging for you to write,

53:19.080 --> 53:21.700
 or maybe that you're really excited to write,

53:21.700 --> 53:24.020
 but that you've been slow to get out the door

53:24.020 --> 53:24.860
 for whatever reason.

53:24.860 --> 53:27.480
 Here I'm talking about my own habits of procrastination.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.480
 Well, that state of being very alert

53:29.480 --> 53:31.200
 but your body being relaxed

53:31.200 --> 53:34.320
 is almost if not the optimal state

53:34.320 --> 53:36.300
 for getting mental work done.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.260
 Because if you're feeling agitated in your body

53:38.260 --> 53:39.460
 and you want to physically move your body,

53:39.460 --> 53:40.760
 it's very hard to do cognitive work,

53:40.760 --> 53:42.060
 at least the sorts of cognitive work

53:42.060 --> 53:45.180
 that involve typing or writing or these sorts of things.

53:45.180 --> 53:48.320
 It's also the exact opposite of the optimal state

53:48.320 --> 53:49.640
 for physical performance,

53:49.640 --> 53:53.480
 which is one of, yes, also alertness.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.700
 Yes, also motivation and elevated mood.

53:55.700 --> 53:59.400
 That's all wonderful stuff to have in mind, literally,

53:59.400 --> 54:01.880
 when you are exercising or competing in sport

54:01.880 --> 54:03.440
 or something of that sort.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.600
 But under those conditions,

54:04.600 --> 54:08.160
 you really also want to have a fast reaction time,

54:08.160 --> 54:09.960
 a low latency for muscle activation

54:09.960 --> 54:11.520
 so that you can make coordinated muscle movements

54:11.520 --> 54:12.920
 in the ways that you need to,

54:12.920 --> 54:15.680
 which is of course what's required of physical endeavors.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.680
 That tells us a few things.

54:16.680 --> 54:18.360
 First of all, it tells us that nicotine

54:18.360 --> 54:21.480
 is going to be generally a bad idea

54:21.480 --> 54:24.920
 for a pre-workout tool

54:24.920 --> 54:28.340
 or for enhancing physical performance.

54:28.340 --> 54:31.360
 However, it's apt to be, and in fact is,

54:31.360 --> 54:34.420
 an excellent tool for enhancing cognitive ability.

54:34.420 --> 54:36.400
 And of course, that triggers my mind

54:36.400 --> 54:37.560
 to return to the anecdote

54:37.560 --> 54:39.400
 about my Nobel Prize-winning colleague

54:39.400 --> 54:42.920
 who ingests nicotine by way of nicotine-containing gum

54:42.920 --> 54:45.440
 in order to increase levels of cognitive focus,

54:45.440 --> 54:47.520
 certainly not for going out and playing sport.

54:47.520 --> 54:50.940
 In fact, despite the fact that he is very, very tall,

54:50.940 --> 54:55.880
 he often points to himself in an appropriately funny way

54:55.880 --> 54:58.720
 that despite being on the basketball team of his high school

54:58.720 --> 55:00.960
 he's probably the worst player that ever existed

55:00.960 --> 55:02.800
 and they only positioned him there because of his height.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.380
 And I guess his head was designed

55:04.380 --> 55:07.320
 to prevent balls from entering the basket.

55:07.320 --> 55:10.960
 In any event, nicotine does seem to be very good

55:10.960 --> 55:14.440
 at enhancing cognitive function, at least in the short term,

55:14.440 --> 55:16.680
 which is not to say that it isn't without its side effects,

55:16.680 --> 55:17.960
 which we will talk about.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.000
 And again, those are side effects

55:19.000 --> 55:20.920
 that are independent of smoking or vaping

55:20.920 --> 55:23.480
 or other forms of ingesting nicotine.

55:23.480 --> 55:27.520
 For instance, dipping or chewing tobacco

55:27.520 --> 55:30.640
 is known to cause a 50-fold, yes, five zero,

55:30.640 --> 55:34.560
 50-fold increase in mouth cancers, things like leukoplakia

55:34.560 --> 55:37.420
 and just generally is terrible for your health.

55:37.420 --> 55:39.960
 I'm sorry to break it to you, but if you're dipping

55:39.960 --> 55:42.480
 or you're using snuff or things of that sort,

55:42.480 --> 55:44.320
 certainly I'm not going to tell people what to do.

55:44.320 --> 55:46.440
 That's not my role in life,

55:46.440 --> 55:49.720
 but you are dramatically increasing the probability

55:49.720 --> 55:52.800
 of an oral cancer or of a mucosal lining cancer

55:52.800 --> 55:54.100
 of some sort.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.040
 So it's not just that smoking and vaping

55:56.040 --> 55:56.880
 are bad for your health.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.660
 These other forms of delivery from nicotine

55:58.660 --> 56:00.080
 can be bad for your health as well.

56:00.080 --> 56:01.520
 And whether or not ingesting nicotine

56:01.520 --> 56:05.120
 by way of nicotine containing gum or patch or toothpick

56:05.120 --> 56:07.800
 or other method is dangerous.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.400
 For other reasons is a discussion that's important.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.600
 Right now, it appears that provided the dosages

56:14.600 --> 56:16.720
 are kept reasonable,

56:16.720 --> 56:18.820
 and we'll talk about what reasonable means a little later,

56:18.820 --> 56:21.640
 and the frequency is kept relatively low,

56:21.640 --> 56:24.360
 so not relying on these things constantly,

56:24.360 --> 56:27.000
 there may in fact be some benefit to ingesting nicotine

56:27.000 --> 56:27.840
 from time to time,

56:27.840 --> 56:32.360
 provided that you are not still developing your brain.

56:32.360 --> 56:33.360
 Now, in reality,

56:33.360 --> 56:35.960
 neuroplasticity goes on throughout the lifetime.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.860
 Your life is actually one long developmental arc.

56:37.860 --> 56:40.240
 It's not only development occurs and then stops,

56:40.240 --> 56:43.160
 but certainly for people before puberty, during puberty,

56:43.160 --> 56:47.200
 and probably for the next 15 to 20 years after puberty,

56:47.200 --> 56:49.800
 avoiding nicotine is probably a good idea.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.200
 Now, of course, development is your entire life.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.800
 It's not like development starts and then ends,

56:53.800 --> 56:58.120
 but certainly for people that are 25 years old or younger,

56:58.120 --> 57:00.800
 ingesting nicotine as a way to enhance cognitive function

57:00.800 --> 57:02.400
 is probably not the best idea.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.960
 And certainly, please,

57:03.960 --> 57:07.360
 for those of you that are 15 years old or younger,

57:07.360 --> 57:09.120
 ingesting nicotine in any form,

57:09.120 --> 57:10.560
 unless it's prescribed by your doctor

57:10.560 --> 57:13.160
 for a very specific clinical reason,

57:13.160 --> 57:15.240
 to me seems just like a terrible idea

57:15.240 --> 57:17.000
 based on all the data that I've read.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.720
 And the reason for that is it's going to create a scenario

57:19.720 --> 57:22.280
 of nicotine dependence in order to achieve heightened levels

57:22.280 --> 57:25.240
 of mood and alertness, et cetera, and that's bad.

57:25.240 --> 57:26.520
 And what we're effectively talking about

57:26.520 --> 57:28.420
 is an addiction for nicotine directly,

57:28.420 --> 57:30.720
 not necessarily the delivery device method

57:30.720 --> 57:33.200
 like smoking or vaping, although it could pull that in

57:33.200 --> 57:35.780
 as an addictive or habit-forming behavior as well.

57:35.780 --> 57:37.800
 But you want to let your neural circuits develop

57:37.800 --> 57:39.880
 to the point where, again,

57:39.880 --> 57:41.920
 unless there's a clinical need for a prescribed drug

57:41.920 --> 57:44.680
 from a licensed physician or psychiatrist, et cetera,

57:44.680 --> 57:47.600
 that you're not relying on chemical enhancement

57:47.600 --> 57:48.580
 of these circuits.

57:48.580 --> 57:53.460
 For people who are 25 years or older,

57:53.460 --> 57:54.820
 and again, that's not a strict cutoff,

57:54.820 --> 57:56.680
 but roughly 25 years or older,

57:56.680 --> 58:00.100
 but for those of you that are thinking about using nicotine

58:00.100 --> 58:03.020
 to enhance cognitive function as adults

58:03.020 --> 58:06.020
 and your brain development is slowing down, right?

58:06.020 --> 58:08.420
 Never ceases, but it's slowing down

58:08.420 --> 58:09.860
 or has slowed down to the point

58:09.860 --> 58:13.000
 where we would say developmental plasticity is largely over

58:13.000 --> 58:14.300
 and you're now operating

58:14.300 --> 58:17.900
 in the context of adult neuroplasticity.

58:17.900 --> 58:20.020
 Well, in that case, there may be instances

58:20.020 --> 58:24.020
 in which increasing acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,

58:24.020 --> 58:26.940
 by way of nicotine ingestion might be a good idea,

58:26.940 --> 58:28.860
 but certainly not by smoking, vaping,

58:28.860 --> 58:31.500
 or by direct contact of tobacco

58:31.500 --> 58:34.140
 to the mucosal lining tissue of the mouth or nose,

58:34.140 --> 58:35.660
 so-called dipping or snuffing.

58:35.660 --> 58:37.000
 For the last 20 minutes or so,

58:37.000 --> 58:38.340
 we've been talking about the biology

58:38.340 --> 58:40.780
 of nicotine specifically, how it impacts the brain,

58:40.780 --> 58:42.960
 how it impacts the body, why it feels so good,

58:42.960 --> 58:44.500
 why it can enhance focus.

58:44.500 --> 58:48.820
 And we've largely set aside smoking, vaping,

58:48.820 --> 58:50.980
 dipping tobacco, and snuffing,

58:50.980 --> 58:53.620
 and the negative effects that those all have

58:53.620 --> 58:55.580
 on mental and physical health.

58:55.580 --> 58:56.860
 Working down from the top of the head

58:56.860 --> 58:58.140
 to the bottom of the feet,

58:58.140 --> 59:02.920
 we can say that smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing

59:02.920 --> 59:05.380
 negatively impact every organ and tissue system

59:05.380 --> 59:08.180
 and cell of the body by virtue of the fact

59:08.180 --> 59:11.360
 that they all damage the endothelial cells.

59:11.360 --> 59:13.100
 Again, the endothelial cells are the cells

59:13.100 --> 59:14.680
 that make up the vasculature,

59:14.680 --> 59:18.120
 which delivers blood and other nutrients

59:18.120 --> 59:21.040
 to all the cells and organs and tissues of the body.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.760
 And those endothelial cells are strongly

59:23.760 --> 59:26.580
 and negatively impacted by all of the practices

59:26.580 --> 59:28.280
 that I just described.

59:28.280 --> 59:30.000
 Now, the way that that happens varies a little bit

59:30.000 --> 59:31.060
 from each one to the next.

59:31.060 --> 59:33.840
 For instance, it has been estimated

59:33.840 --> 59:35.520
 that cigarettes contain anywhere

59:35.520 --> 59:38.380
 from 4,000 to 7,000 toxins.

59:38.380 --> 59:40.380
 Now, the word toxins is a real buzzword these days.

59:40.380 --> 59:42.740
 You hear about detoxes and toxins,

59:42.740 --> 59:46.880
 but more specifically, we know that it contains carcinogens.

59:46.880 --> 59:49.360
 These are cancer promoting compounds.

59:49.360 --> 59:52.120
 For instance, we know that the tar in cigarettes,

59:52.120 --> 59:53.740
 even low tar cigarettes,

59:53.740 --> 59:55.700
 as well as the ammonia within cigarettes,

59:55.700 --> 59:58.780
 as well as the formaldehyde contained within cigarettes,

59:58.780 --> 1:00:00.840
 as well as the carbon dioxide that's generated

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:04.000
 from smoking those cigarettes are all carcinogens.

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.420
 Carbon dioxide also has the negative effect

1:00:06.420 --> 1:00:08.760
 of depleting the amount of oxygen that's delivered

1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:10.440
 to any and all of our tissues

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:14.000
 by way of the impact of carbon dioxide,

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.640
 binding hemoglobin and preventing hemoglobin

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.440
 from delivering oxygen to the tissues of the body.

1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:23.440
 So while there may be 4,000 or 4,500 or 7,000 toxins,

1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:24.600
 depending on which cigarette,

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.520
 which papers they happen to be rolled in,

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:28.320
 whether or not they're filtered or non-filtered,

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.880
 the type of tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:33.440
 there are a tremendous number of toxins

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.820
 and there are some very potent carcinogens

1:00:35.820 --> 1:00:37.860
 within that long list of toxins.

1:00:37.860 --> 1:00:41.080
 Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde and carbon dioxide

1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:43.640
 being the most potent of those carcinogens.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.640
 Now, the fact that there are carcinogens in cigarettes

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:47.080
 sometimes leads cigarette smokers

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:48.960
 and particularly the cigarette smokers

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:50.340
 that have the hardest time quitting

1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:52.320
 or that enjoy their cigarettes the most from saying,

1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:54.320
 well, listen, everything is a carcinogen

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:55.140
 or everything kills you.

1:00:55.140 --> 1:00:58.840
 Well, certainly that's not a true statement.

1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:01.480
 And while there are other carcinogens in the environment,

1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:04.360
 so environmental hazards like solvents

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.100
 and even if you work in a laboratory, for instance,

1:01:07.100 --> 1:01:09.860
 we use in the laboratory DNA intercalating dyes.

1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:11.400
 These are literally dyes that allow us

1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:13.200
 to see the DNA structure of cells

1:01:13.200 --> 1:01:14.540
 and see the proteins they make

1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:16.160
 and see the RNAs they make.

1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:17.480
 And it's very important to wear gloves

1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:18.360
 when you work with those things

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:20.440
 because as the name suggests, they intercalate,

1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:22.560
 they actually get in between the strands of DNA

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:23.660
 and separate them.

1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:26.160
 They are mutagens, they mutate DNA.

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:27.820
 They are often carcinogens as well.

1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:29.120
 So we have them in our laboratory,

1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:30.400
 but we take certain precautions

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:32.560
 to not have them negatively impact our health,

1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:34.100
 safety protocols and so on.

1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:38.140
 We hear that there are carcinogens in car exhaust

1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:41.020
 and bus exhaust and in all sorts of things like pesticides.

1:01:41.020 --> 1:01:42.260
 And that's all true.

1:01:42.260 --> 1:01:45.060
 So in the argument of probabilities, one would say,

1:01:45.060 --> 1:01:47.440
 well, if there are all these other carcinogens

1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:48.280
 in the environment,

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:51.340
 why would you compound their carcinogenic effect

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:54.460
 by smoking or vaping or dipping or snuffing?

1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:56.360
 But that usually doesn't get people to quit smoking

1:01:56.360 --> 1:01:57.200
 or doing those things

1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:58.820
 because of the powerful reinforcing effects

1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:00.140
 of nicotine itself.

1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:02.920
 So again, nicotine is the reinforcing element

1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:05.980
 by way of triggering that dopamine reinforcement pathway,

1:02:05.980 --> 1:02:07.700
 the mesolimbic reward pathway.

1:02:07.700 --> 1:02:11.380
 And of course there are all the other additional effects

1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:13.060
 of increased focus,

1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:15.660
 such as increased ability to pay attention to work

1:02:15.660 --> 1:02:17.540
 or to others that lead to other rewards.

1:02:17.540 --> 1:02:19.940
 And so then it becomes a situation of compounding reward.

1:02:19.940 --> 1:02:21.460
 So it's not really about the cigarette,

1:02:21.460 --> 1:02:22.380
 it's about the nicotine.

1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:23.580
 And it's not really about the nicotine,

1:02:23.580 --> 1:02:25.580
 it's about the dopamine that the nicotine evokes.

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:27.180
 And then it's not really about the dopamine

1:02:27.180 --> 1:02:30.000
 that the nicotine evokes directly per se,

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.820
 but also about all the positive effects

1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:34.500
 that that increased dopamine results in.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:37.140
 So we can easily circle back to the negative effects

1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:40.180
 of smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing

1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:43.540
 and say the endothelial cells are disrupted.

1:02:43.540 --> 1:02:46.060
 The endothelial cells are involved in delivery of blood

1:02:46.060 --> 1:02:48.300
 and other nutrients to every tissue of the body

1:02:48.300 --> 1:02:51.020
 and smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing

1:02:51.020 --> 1:02:53.540
 contain carcinogens, which are cancer promoting.

1:02:53.540 --> 1:02:55.780
 And because the epidemiological studies are out there,

1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:58.040
 we can actually arrive at some very clear numbers

1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:01.420
 as to how much life one will lose

1:03:01.420 --> 1:03:05.300
 from ingesting nicotine by way of those four delivery

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:07.620
 devices, or I should say any one

1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:09.380
 of those four delivery devices.

1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:11.260
 Although I should also mention that many people

1:03:11.260 --> 1:03:13.280
 who are vaping are also smoking cigarettes,

1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:14.740
 this is becoming increasingly common.

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:16.820
 A lot of people are using vaping in one context

1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:18.020
 and cigarettes in another,

1:03:18.020 --> 1:03:20.060
 dipping in one context, vaping in another.

1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:23.040
 But even for those that only smoke or only vape

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.440
 or only dip or only snuff,

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:30.020
 the negative effects are dramatic and calculable.

1:03:30.020 --> 1:03:32.880
 So it is thought that for every pack of cigarettes

1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:35.560
 consumed per day, so you could average that out

1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:37.940
 if you're a two a day cigarette smoker

1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:41.500
 or a pack a day cigarette smoker or two pack a day,

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:44.740
 for every pack of cigarettes smoked per day,

1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:50.720
 we can reliably estimate a 14 year reduction in lifespan.

1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:55.120
 So cigarettes are literally peeling years off your life.

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:57.020
 Now, because of the way that the brain works

1:03:57.020 --> 1:04:00.480
 and the way that human beings anticipate the future

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:03.820
 and can be grounded both in the present and the future

1:04:03.820 --> 1:04:04.900
 or the present and the past,

1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:06.180
 that's just how the mind works, right?

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:07.500
 That's why we can think about the future,

1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:10.500
 but also realize where we are in time and space today.

1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:11.800
 Because of that, many people will say,

1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:15.040
 well, I enjoy cigarettes or I enjoy vaping.

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:16.560
 And so at least while I'm here, I'm enjoying it.

1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:19.660
 And that's because the dopamine system is not very good

1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:22.720
 at understanding opportunity costs.

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:25.500
 That is what we would be doing in those 14 years

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:26.740
 and what we would be enjoying.

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:28.440
 And the enrichment that we would get

1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:30.680
 if we were to live into those 14 years.

1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:33.700
 So at some level, the smoker, the vapor is being rational

1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:35.740
 when they say, yeah, but I enjoy this.

1:04:35.740 --> 1:04:39.240
 And so the years lost, I can't really register that

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:41.080
 because it's hard to register what you don't have

1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:43.040
 and what you've never had, right?

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:46.500
 On the other hand, we can also point to the statistic

1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:49.860
 that there is this 50 fold increase in mouth cancers

1:04:49.860 --> 1:04:53.400
 from dipping and there are nasal cancers as well

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:56.280
 that are greatly increased by snuffing.

1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:01.280
 And from smoking, and now we know based on data from vaping

1:05:01.700 --> 1:05:05.520
 that the endothelial cell damage and the direct effects

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:07.320
 of damage to the lungs from TARS.

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:08.740
 And even if people are vaping,

1:05:08.740 --> 1:05:11.920
 which tends to have lower TARS than do cigarettes,

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:13.640
 even for people that are vaping,

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:17.080
 greatly increased probability of stroke,

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.760
 of peripheral vascular disease.

1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:21.240
 So this is peripheral pain because remember,

1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:23.920
 blood is delivering not just blood, but other nutrients

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:26.320
 and it's clearing things out from tissues.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:29.440
 So there's an accumulation of literally toxins and debris

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:31.660
 that cells generate all the time, which is healthy,

1:05:31.660 --> 1:05:35.300
 but then normally is cleared away by the endothelial cells

1:05:35.300 --> 1:05:38.120
 and by other cell types of the immune system.

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:41.180
 That's all increased in people that engage

1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:43.700
 in these nicotine delivery device behaviors.

1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:47.100
 Rates of heart attack, rates of stroke,

1:05:47.100 --> 1:05:49.920
 rates of cognitive decline are all increased.

1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:51.000
 Now you might say cognitive decline,

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.120
 I thought that nicotine increases the likelihood

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:56.160
 that we can maintain healthy neuronal function

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:57.480
 and cognitive capacity.

1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:00.120
 It might even increase cognitive capacity in a potent way

1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:01.880
 in the short term, and indeed it does.

1:06:01.880 --> 1:06:06.160
 However, cigarette smoking and vaping are now known

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:10.100
 to dramatically decrease cognitive function

1:06:10.100 --> 1:06:12.320
 because one of the key things about the brain

1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:15.040
 is that it is the most metabolically demanding organ,

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:16.640
 which means it consumes a lot of glucose.

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:18.800
 Or even if you're ketogenic, you need ketones,

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:20.640
 you need nutrients getting to the neurons

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:22.760
 and other cell types of the brain and nervous system

1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:24.440
 in order for it to function properly.

1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:26.280
 And when you disrupt the vasculature

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:28.700
 through this endothelial cell dysfunction,

1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:30.200
 you got things like interstitial,

1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:32.420
 which just means in the spaces between dysfunction.

1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:35.580
 So it's not just beating up the endothelial cells themselves

1:06:35.580 --> 1:06:38.160
 but the spaces between the cells is being disrupted.

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:39.920
 There's a lot of debris that accumulates there.

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:41.520
 And as a consequence,

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:44.360
 the brain just simply will not function as well.

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:46.280
 So you start getting short-term memory lapses,

1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:47.800
 you start getting working memory lapses.

1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:49.280
 Working memory is a sort of memory

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:52.500
 if someone tells you their seven digit phone number,

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:54.400
 typically nowadays people just share their info,

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.720
 but seven digit phone number or a sequence of numbers

1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:58.700
 or an address and your inability to remember that.

1:06:58.700 --> 1:07:00.160
 So you're walking back to the kitchen sink

1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:02.440
 and you can't remember what you were trying to remember

1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:04.540
 just a short moment ago, that's working memory.

1:07:04.540 --> 1:07:07.320
 Working memory suffers long-term memory,

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.480
 projective or interrogate memories into the future.

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:13.560
 How can you remember things in the future

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:14.440
 that haven't occurred yet?

1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:17.400
 Well, this is more of a memory for future plans

1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:20.680
 or ideas and planning for things that are to come.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:23.240
 So what we can very reliably say is that currently

1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:25.760
 more than 1 billion, billion,

1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:29.240
 more than 1 billion people consume tobacco

1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:30.940
 in order to get their nicotine,

1:07:30.940 --> 1:07:34.060
 because that's really the reinforcing element within tobacco.

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:37.360
 More than 1 billion people consume tobacco

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:41.000
 in the form of cigarettes every day.

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.720
 A growing number of people,

1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:46.920
 more than half a billion people now are starting to vape.

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:50.520
 The estimates range from 200 million to 500 million.

1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:52.000
 And there's a lot of debate about this

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.920
 because a lot of people are hybrid smokers and vapers,

1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:57.000
 meaning they do one or both,

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.520
 depending on time of day and location,

1:07:58.520 --> 1:07:59.880
 as I mentioned before.

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:04.120
 But now you start to see how you can get to the number

1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:06.480
 that billions of people are consuming tobacco,

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:08.200
 because of course you also have your people

1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:10.360
 that are dipping and your people that are snuffing.

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:11.280
 And as I mentioned before,

1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:12.840
 you have people that are engaging

1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:15.520
 in multiple of these behaviors.

1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:18.540
 So billions of people on planet earth,

1:08:18.540 --> 1:08:22.500
 anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of human beings,

1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:23.960
 incredible, right?

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:26.160
 Anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of human beings

1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:28.800
 are consuming tobacco in one form or another

1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:32.740
 in order to get their nicotine one way or another.

1:08:32.740 --> 1:08:36.560
 And as a consequence are peeling ears off their life,

1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:40.120
 dramatically increasing the probability of cancer, stroke,

1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:45.120
 heart attack, peripheral neuropathies, brain dysfunction,

1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:46.560
 meaning cognitive dysfunction,

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:49.840
 memory impairment, sexual dysfunction.

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:50.680
 There are a number of studies

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:52.680
 that have looked at increases in cortisol,

1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:55.680
 and while minor, those increases do exist,

1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:57.160
 decreases in growth hormone,

1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:00.260
 and while minor, those decreases exist.

1:09:00.260 --> 1:09:05.040
 But even setting aside the negative impact on endocrine,

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:08.460
 on hormone factors, it's very, very clear

1:09:08.460 --> 1:09:13.000
 that smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.480
 are among the worst things that we can do for our health.

1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:19.720
 They are among the leading causes of preventable death

1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:21.860
 and debilitating life conditions,

1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:24.800
 which may lead you to the question

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:29.020
 as to why in the world would people do this?

1:09:29.020 --> 1:09:33.000
 Well, it turns out most of them don't want to.

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.120
 In the best surveys that one can find

1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:37.540
 of if you could quit smoking,

1:09:37.540 --> 1:09:39.940
 if you could quit vaping, would you?

1:09:39.940 --> 1:09:43.240
 What you find is that at least for cigarette smokers,

1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:47.540
 70%, seven zero, want to quit.

1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:49.200
 They would love to quit,

1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:52.040
 and yet they find that to be exceedingly difficult.

1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:54.520
 And the reason they find it to be exceedingly difficult

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:56.600
 is because of all the brain neurochemistry

1:09:56.600 --> 1:09:57.520
 that we talked about before.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:59.400
 The reason I spent close to 20 minutes

1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:01.980
 talking about dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway,

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:04.440
 acetylcholine in the nucleus basalis,

1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:08.000
 and epinephrine and the relaxation of muscles

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.920
 in the periphery and the increase in readiness

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:13.780
 in the body and brain is that all of those combined

1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:15.800
 to make nicotine one of the most powerful

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:17.640
 and potent cognitive enhancers,

1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:19.800
 and to some extent, physical enhancer,

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:21.520
 although, as I mentioned before,

1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:25.000
 the total number of physical exercise

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.640
 or physical sport promoting effects of nicotine

1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:31.740
 is very, very small, if not zero.

1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:33.160
 There are certain conditions

1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:36.120
 under which one might imagine using nicotine

1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:37.900
 specifically for cognitive enhancement

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:41.400
 where performance of complex motor skills

1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:43.880
 would sort of outweigh the negative effects

1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.060
 on the neuromuscular system,

1:10:45.060 --> 1:10:47.720
 our ability to generate coordinated movements.

1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:49.260
 There's actually an excellent study

1:10:49.260 --> 1:10:51.280
 looking at the effects of nicotine,

1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:52.560
 not by smoking delivery,

1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:55.120
 but by a different delivery mechanism

1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:59.440
 in which they looked at performance of hitters in baseball.

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:01.180
 The experiment was kind of an interesting one.

1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:03.340
 Even though these were fairly skilled baseball players,

1:11:03.340 --> 1:11:05.840
 what they had them do was hit a ball off a tee.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:08.620
 As I recall growing up, and admittedly,

1:11:08.620 --> 1:11:09.640
 I didn't play much baseball,

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:12.040
 but you start off on tee ball and then you would go,

1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:13.280
 I think it was to pitching machine,

1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:15.400
 then they would use actual pitchers who throw the ball.

1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:16.440
 But in this case,

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:19.200
 it was a couple of different baseball-related tasks.

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:21.760
 They'd have people hit the ball off a tee,

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.520
 but they had to direct that hit

1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:25.800
 toward a ball atop another tee.

1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:28.080
 So it's fairly precise targeting that's required

1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:30.000
 in order to knock that ball off the other tee.

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.680
 So this is an activity that involves not just motor output,

1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:34.440
 but coordinated motor output,

1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.680
 and not just coordinated motor output,

1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:40.640
 but directed coordinated output that requires some,

1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.480
 as we would say, top-down processing, right?

1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:44.820
 This isn't the kind of thing that can be done reflexively.

1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:47.280
 This is the kind of thing where the forebrain,

1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:48.640
 the prefrontal cortex in particular

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.740
 has to be heavily involved

1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:51.660
 in order to suppress certain actions

1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:53.220
 and then create other actions.

1:11:53.220 --> 1:11:54.640
 So the basic takeaway of the study

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:57.960
 is that nicotine delivered by way of nicotine gum,

1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:00.160
 not by smoking, dipping, or snuffing,

1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:04.280
 was able to increase cognitive performance and motor output.

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:09.000
 So a rare circumstance where a specific set of demands

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.480
 that involve both cognitive engagement

1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:12.840
 and physical engagement

1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:15.560
 showed a slight but significant improvement.

1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:17.640
 But again, in most cases,

1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:21.240
 nicotine is just simply not going to improve physical output

1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.920
 if it's delivered through a smoked cigarette,

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:27.780
 through vaping, through dipping, or through snuffing.

1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:29.840
 So if all these behaviors are terrible

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:32.480
 for essentially every aspect of our health, frankly,

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:33.440
 I mean, when you look at the literature,

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:34.580
 it's terrible for pregnant women.

1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:35.620
 It's terrible for kids.

1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:37.340
 It's terrible for older people.

1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:38.860
 It's terrible for younger people.

1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:40.840
 I mean, you really cannot find a scenario

1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:43.820
 in which smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing

1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:44.920
 are good for us.

1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:47.320
 And yet people like the effects on the brain

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:49.540
 and they feel quite addicted to them,

1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:50.920
 even if they say they're not.

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.140
 Most of those people would be unwilling to give up

1:12:54.140 --> 1:12:56.900
 their practice of nicotine delivery

1:12:56.900 --> 1:12:58.100
 for more than a few hours.

1:12:58.100 --> 1:13:00.080
 In fact, if you look at the effects of withdrawal,

1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:02.280
 and we are going to talk about what withdrawal

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:05.060
 of nicotine looks like, what you find is that

1:13:05.060 --> 1:13:09.880
 as soon as four hours after the last ingestion of nicotine

1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:13.440
 by way of cigarette or vaping or dipping or snuffing,

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:16.320
 what people start to experience is some agitation,

1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:18.240
 craving for nicotine, of course.

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:20.820
 And while craving is kind of a vague concept,

1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:23.360
 it's actually a very specific biological mechanism.

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:26.840
 It's the drop in dopamine that's starting to occur,

1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:29.960
 so much so that there's a drop in dopamine below baseline.

1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:31.920
 That is the increase in dopamine

1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:35.360
 that would normally be experienced from smoking, vaping,

1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:38.000
 dipping, or snuffing is now not happening.

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.160
 And in fact, the levels of dopamine are dropping

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:41.600
 below where they would have been

1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:44.520
 even without performing that behavior.

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.780
 So that's what craving is,

1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:50.160
 and withdrawal is an increased sense of that craving,

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.480
 as well as a lot of negative stuff like stomach aches

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:54.900
 or nausea or irritability,

1:13:54.900 --> 1:13:56.960
 and often collections of all of those.

1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:58.880
 So because these nicotine delivery approaches

1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:01.120
 are so terrible for our health,

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.000
 and also because as many as 70% of people who smoke

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.320
 would like to quit, but either feel they can't

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:11.280
 because they've tried and failed repeatedly often,

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.200
 or because it's just too scary,

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:15.360
 meaning the reinforcing properties are too strong

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:18.280
 and therefore they can't imagine living without them,

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:20.960
 or the withdrawal effects are too strong

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:23.720
 and they can't imagine living with those,

1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:26.960
 well then is there hope for quitting smoking,

1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:29.280
 vaping, snuffing, or dipping?

1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:31.880
 And the short answer, fortunately, is yes.

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:33.320
 There are excellent ways to do that,

1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:36.920
 and some of them are single event treatments.

1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:39.500
 And we're going to talk about those shortly.

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:40.360
 But before we do that,

1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:42.440
 I want to highlight one very brief point,

1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:46.580
 which is that nicotine is not the cause of cancer.

1:14:46.580 --> 1:14:48.700
 Nicotine is not the carcinogen.

1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:52.080
 It's the other things in tobacco

1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:55.800
 or associated with the nicotine delivery device

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:57.360
 that are causing cancer,

1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:00.520
 and I should mention the other negative impacts

1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:02.060
 on our health in particular

1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:06.080
 by way of disrupted endothelial blood vessel function.

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:07.880
 Now that leads us to this issue of vaping,

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:11.040
 because as many of you know, and probably are thinking

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:13.920
 as I've been delivering this information,

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.860
 people don't vape tobacco.

1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:19.160
 The way that vaping pens are designed

1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:22.740
 is that it includes some liquid, it involves heat,

1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:25.640
 and it does not involve the burning off of tobacco.

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:28.680
 In fact, there's a constant updating

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:30.920
 of the engineering of these vape pens

1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:33.120
 so that they can be very low heat.

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:37.240
 In some cases, they use even non-heating approaches

1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:39.040
 to vaporize the nicotine

1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:42.600
 and allow it to enter the bloodstream very quickly.

1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:47.600
 I must say in a lot of ways, vaping resembles crack cocaine.

1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:51.140
 The reason why vaping and crack cocaine are so similar

1:15:51.140 --> 1:15:55.120
 is the speed of entry of nicotine into the bloodstream.

1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:57.380
 This isn't an episode about cocaine,

1:15:57.380 --> 1:15:59.320
 but I just want to very briefly touch

1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:01.320
 on some of the delivery routes for cocaine

1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:04.120
 because they parallel a lot of the delivery routes

1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:06.320
 for nicotine, and we can learn a lot

1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:09.600
 about drug pharmacokinetics and dopamine

1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:13.200
 if we look at the parallels between cocaine and nicotine.

1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:18.320
 I'll preface this by saying cocaine is a terrible drug.

1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:21.140
 It is actually a schedule II drug in the United States,

1:16:21.140 --> 1:16:23.760
 which means that it has a very, very limited

1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:25.560
 yet still present medical application,

1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:29.680
 mainly as an anesthetic in certain laboratory

1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:31.520
 and hospital conditions.

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.680
 But aside from that, it's very clear

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.840
 that cocaine is one of the most debilitating drugs

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:37.800
 that humans can use because of the way

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:39.600
 that it impacts the dopamine system.

1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:43.120
 And it basically creates a loop whereby the only thing

1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:46.860
 that can really trigger dopamine release is cocaine.

1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:50.200
 And as I've said before, the way that I define addiction

1:16:50.200 --> 1:16:52.260
 is it's a progressive narrowing of the things

1:16:52.260 --> 1:16:53.320
 that bring people pleasure.

1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:55.400
 Cocaine certainly falls into the category

1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:58.720
 of addictive drugs, strongly addictive drugs.

1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:01.540
 And in fact, it has the additionally pernicious feature

1:17:01.540 --> 1:17:04.840
 that after using cocaine for some period of time,

1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:06.520
 the amount of dopamine that's released

1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:08.920
 becomes progressively lower and lower and lower

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:10.980
 so that people can never get back to a state

1:17:10.980 --> 1:17:13.860
 in which dopamine release is ever as great

1:17:13.860 --> 1:17:15.600
 as it was the first time they did cocaine

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:17.620
 or prior to doing cocaine.

1:17:17.620 --> 1:17:22.620
 Now, with a long period of no cocaine use whatsoever

1:17:22.620 --> 1:17:25.820
 and protecting the dopamine system

1:17:25.820 --> 1:17:29.240
 in a number of different ways, people can often,

1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:32.700
 not always, but often recover their dopamine system,

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.220
 if not completely, then near completely.

1:17:35.220 --> 1:17:38.980
 So by all means, if you have a problem with cocaine, quit,

1:17:38.980 --> 1:17:41.100
 find a way to quit, get treatment,

1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:42.740
 get over that one way or another.

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:46.300
 We have an episode with an expert guest, Dr. Anna Lemke,

1:17:46.300 --> 1:17:47.900
 who's a physician and the chief

1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:49.540
 of the Stanford School of Medicine

1:17:49.540 --> 1:17:51.700
 Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic.

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:54.780
 She's a world expert in dopamine and addictive substances

1:17:54.780 --> 1:17:56.180
 and addictions of all kinds.

1:17:56.180 --> 1:17:58.460
 You can find that episode at Hubermanlab.com.

1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:01.020
 It's filled with information about how to get over

1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:03.120
 different types of addictions, including cocaine addiction.

1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:05.320
 Also check out her absolutely phenomenal

1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:07.220
 and indeed important book, Dopamine Nation,

1:18:07.220 --> 1:18:09.660
 which touches on some of this as well.

1:18:09.660 --> 1:18:11.980
 And in the show note captions for the episode

1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:14.120
 where Dr. Lemke was my guest,

1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:16.560
 you can also find some additional resources related to that.

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:17.740
 So cocaine is terrible.

1:18:17.740 --> 1:18:19.300
 That needs to be acknowledged.

1:18:19.300 --> 1:18:21.100
 It should be avoided and you should find a way

1:18:21.100 --> 1:18:23.260
 to quit it if you are currently using.

1:18:24.380 --> 1:18:27.580
 With that said, the delivery mechanism for cocaine

1:18:27.580 --> 1:18:30.900
 strongly parallels the delivery mechanisms for nicotine.

1:18:30.900 --> 1:18:32.600
 That is people will snort cocaine,

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:34.720
 which is a lot like snuffing or dipping.

1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.260
 That is when people snort cocaine,

1:18:36.260 --> 1:18:38.780
 they're bringing cocaine into proximity or into contact

1:18:38.780 --> 1:18:41.820
 really with the mucosal lining of the nasal passages,

1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:44.620
 which then allows the psychoactive substances

1:18:44.620 --> 1:18:46.960
 to permeate into the bloodstream.

1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:49.100
 Very seldom do people eat it,

1:18:49.100 --> 1:18:52.100
 although that does happen from time to time.

1:18:52.100 --> 1:18:55.060
 People will inject it, then a so-called main lining,

1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:57.020
 which is a very rapid entry into the bloodstream

1:18:57.020 --> 1:18:59.680
 because it's direct application to the bloodstream

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:00.780
 by way of injection.

1:19:00.780 --> 1:19:02.280
 And then there's crack cocaine,

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.140
 which is essentially like a vaporizing of the cocaine

1:19:05.140 --> 1:19:07.660
 from a so-called cocaine rock

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:12.660
 that somewhat resembles vaping of nicotine.

1:19:12.660 --> 1:19:15.360
 So while the vape pen involves a liquid

1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:17.740
 that sold a cartridge that contains nicotine

1:19:17.740 --> 1:19:20.340
 and often other flavors as well,

1:19:20.340 --> 1:19:21.820
 flavorings I should say,

1:19:23.340 --> 1:19:27.860
 both crack cocaine and vaping cause very rapid increases

1:19:27.860 --> 1:19:29.880
 in the relative substances that are psychoactive.

1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:32.100
 In the case of cocaine, that would be cocaine

1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:34.880
 and the increase in dopamine in the brain and body,

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:35.720
 I should mention.

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:37.060
 And in the case of vaping,

1:19:37.060 --> 1:19:39.780
 there's a very rapid increase in blood concentrations

1:19:39.780 --> 1:19:43.340
 of nicotine, much faster than occur with cigarette smoking

1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:45.780
 or other modes of nicotine delivery.

1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:49.740
 So that speed of onset turns out to be a critical parameter

1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:52.520
 because the speed of onset of nicotine

1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:56.100
 is going to also determine the speed of release of dopamine

1:19:56.100 --> 1:19:58.180
 in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area,

1:19:58.180 --> 1:20:00.520
 that mesolimbic reward pathway.

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:02.180
 And with the mesolimbic reward pathway,

1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:04.440
 it's not just about the peak,

1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:08.180
 meaning the maximal amount of dopamine that's released,

1:20:08.180 --> 1:20:11.020
 but it's the time course, how steep the curve is,

1:20:11.020 --> 1:20:12.680
 how quickly that dopamine increases,

1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:15.180
 that's going to determine how reinforcing,

1:20:15.180 --> 1:20:17.560
 how habit forming and indeed how addictive

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:19.380
 a particular substance is.

1:20:19.380 --> 1:20:21.580
 So one of the major important differences

1:20:21.580 --> 1:20:23.400
 between vaping and cigarette smoking

1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:27.620
 is that the onset of dopamine release from vaping is faster.

1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:30.420
 And even a subtle increase in the rate

1:20:30.420 --> 1:20:33.860
 at which dopamine increases in the mesolimbic reward pathway

1:20:33.860 --> 1:20:37.180
 can make a given amount of nicotine

1:20:37.180 --> 1:20:40.780
 much more habit forming and addictive.

1:20:40.780 --> 1:20:44.580
 This probably explains the fact that many, many more people

1:20:44.580 --> 1:20:47.300
 in particular young people, age 25 and younger

1:20:47.300 --> 1:20:50.300
 are vaping at phenomenal rates now.

1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:52.780
 People are starting to vape in just about everywhere.

1:20:52.780 --> 1:20:54.740
 You see this in restaurants, you see it on the street.

1:20:54.740 --> 1:20:57.220
 Indeed, you even see it in the classroom.

1:20:57.220 --> 1:21:00.300
 This has actually become sort of sport of sorts.

1:21:00.300 --> 1:21:02.020
 It's certainly not something I encourage.

1:21:02.020 --> 1:21:05.020
 In fact, when I learned about this from a college student,

1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:06.220
 new college student,

1:21:06.220 --> 1:21:08.180
 he's telling me that many college students

1:21:08.180 --> 1:21:10.020
 are actually bringing vape pens into the classroom.

1:21:10.020 --> 1:21:11.860
 I think this is also happening in high schools

1:21:11.860 --> 1:21:13.820
 and even junior high schools.

1:21:13.820 --> 1:21:16.580
 This is a really concerning practice.

1:21:16.580 --> 1:21:17.860
 And here, I'm not trying to come across

1:21:17.860 --> 1:21:20.060
 as the anti-vaping crusader,

1:21:20.060 --> 1:21:22.520
 but I must say given the negative effects

1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.280
 on one's health in the longterm,

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:28.060
 but also given these exceedingly powerful reward properties

1:21:28.060 --> 1:21:30.760
 of nicotine entering the bloodstream quickly

1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:33.340
 and dopamine being released very quickly

1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:35.680
 from the mesolimbic reward pathway,

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:38.300
 what we're seeing out there makes total sense.

1:21:38.300 --> 1:21:42.020
 Young people's brains are essentially getting wired

1:21:42.020 --> 1:21:44.160
 to the expectation that dopamine

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:47.140
 is going to be increased dramatically and quickly

1:21:47.140 --> 1:21:48.200
 under their control,

1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:50.100
 except it's under their control

1:21:50.100 --> 1:21:52.500
 only in a very narrow set of circumstances.

1:21:52.500 --> 1:21:54.320
 Recall the definition of addiction,

1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:56.300
 a progressive narrowing of the things

1:21:56.300 --> 1:21:57.140
 that bring you pleasure.

1:21:57.140 --> 1:21:59.780
 We can change that statement

1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:04.780
 to also say a progressive narrowing and specific kinetics,

1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:07.460
 that is specific time course

1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:09.180
 of the things that bring you pleasure.

1:22:09.180 --> 1:22:10.780
 Now that's a bit of a nerdier statement

1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:12.060
 than a progressive narrowing of the things

1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:12.880
 that bring you pleasure,

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:16.560
 but what we're going to see in the next few years, I believe,

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:18.980
 is an entire generation of young people

1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:21.880
 for which a very large percentage of them

1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:25.520
 are going to be seeking out a pattern or feeling,

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:26.660
 because to the person taking it,

1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:28.200
 they're not looking at their dopamine levels

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:29.280
 rising in their blood,

1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:31.340
 they're experiencing this as an increase in focus,

1:22:31.340 --> 1:22:32.380
 an increase in alertness,

1:22:32.380 --> 1:22:34.340
 an increase in mood and wellbeing

1:22:34.340 --> 1:22:37.380
 that is very rapid, very dramatic,

1:22:37.380 --> 1:22:40.220
 and that simply cannot be recreated

1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:41.940
 by any other substance,

1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:44.540
 and that's a very concerning scenario,

1:22:44.540 --> 1:22:47.620
 concerning because that mesolimbic reward pathway

1:22:47.620 --> 1:22:49.420
 is the only pathway,

1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:52.400
 the only pathway by which you can achieve

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:55.540
 the rewarding properties of any kind of endeavor,

1:22:55.540 --> 1:22:57.900
 not just vaping, of course,

1:22:57.900 --> 1:23:00.260
 it is the way in which people achieve satisfaction

1:23:00.260 --> 1:23:03.980
 from reaching a relationship goal or an athletic goal

1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:05.820
 or an educational goal,

1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:08.180
 any kind of goal or sense of satisfaction,

1:23:08.180 --> 1:23:10.360
 and so it comes as no surprise

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:12.620
 that vaping is strongly associated

1:23:12.620 --> 1:23:14.420
 with increased levels of depression,

1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:16.580
 especially when vaping use drops off,

1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:17.460
 why would that be?

1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:19.260
 If people are getting so much more dopamine

1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:20.660
 so much more quickly from vaping,

1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:22.500
 shouldn't they be feeling better?

1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:24.860
 That brings us back to the critical,

1:23:24.860 --> 1:23:26.500
 and I should say defining feature

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:28.060
 of the dopamine reward pathway

1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:29.860
 for motivation and wellbeing,

1:23:29.860 --> 1:23:33.100
 which is that initially a given substance will cause,

1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:35.900
 let's say an eight out of 10, again, arbitrary units,

1:23:35.900 --> 1:23:39.100
 but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine,

1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:40.520
 but with repeated use,

1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:43.480
 what ends up happening is that even at similar

1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:45.280
 or higher levels of ingestion,

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:47.380
 so not just one inhalation a minute,

1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:49.060
 but maybe two inhalations a minute

1:23:49.060 --> 1:23:51.540
 or inhalation every 30 seconds,

1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:54.660
 now it's level four out of 10 activation of dopamine

1:23:54.660 --> 1:23:55.780
 and then three and then two,

1:23:55.780 --> 1:23:58.040
 and eventually it drops below baseline.

1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:00.260
 Now the whole system can be recovered by abstinence

1:24:00.260 --> 1:24:02.740
 from nicotine consumption,

1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:04.980
 but the dopamine system is applied to everything,

1:24:04.980 --> 1:24:07.580
 all sense of wellbeing, all sense of motivation.

1:24:07.580 --> 1:24:10.300
 So during the period in which one is abstaining

1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:12.800
 from nicotine and vaping in particular,

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.980
 people do not feel good, they feel miserable,

1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.120
 that's why it's called withdrawal,

1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:20.420
 it's associated with a bunch of psychological

1:24:20.420 --> 1:24:24.020
 and physiological symptoms that all lead back

1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:27.580
 to trying to get to the same levels of dopamine release

1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:29.900
 in the same patterns that were experienced

1:24:29.900 --> 1:24:32.140
 when one initially started vaping.

1:24:32.140 --> 1:24:33.980
 So I'm not trying to paint a dark picture here,

1:24:33.980 --> 1:24:36.600
 but frankly, the picture is very dark.

1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:40.320
 I'm very concerned about a practice of ingesting something

1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:42.800
 that powerfully modulates the dopamine system

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:44.480
 with the sorts of kinetics that one sees

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:46.780
 from ingestion of crack cocaine in young people

1:24:46.780 --> 1:24:48.860
 that has all these other negative health effects

1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:51.260
 that in the short term is very powerfully rewarding,

1:24:51.260 --> 1:24:53.460
 increased focus, wellbeing, et cetera,

1:24:53.460 --> 1:24:56.320
 but that over a very brief period of time

1:24:56.320 --> 1:25:00.780
 leads to a state in which the entire dopamine reward system

1:25:00.780 --> 1:25:03.820
 is impaired and can become permanently impaired

1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:06.820
 unless one intervenes in a very deliberate way.

1:25:06.820 --> 1:25:09.940
 So people are directly controlling the rate of dopamine

1:25:09.940 --> 1:25:12.080
 and the frequency of dopamine release

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:15.420
 by the duration and frequency of inhalations

1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:16.780
 off the vape pen.

1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:19.940
 And that's an incredible thing because what it does

1:25:19.940 --> 1:25:22.260
 is it sets up the mesolimbic reward pathway

1:25:22.260 --> 1:25:24.860
 for an expectation that dopamine will be delivered

1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:26.560
 on that schedule.

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:30.320
 So that's one of the things that makes vaping in particular

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:32.400
 so hard to quit.

1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:35.980
 Vaping is actually harder to quit than cigarette smoking

1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:37.900
 for most people.

1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:39.540
 Now, does that mean that cigarette smoking

1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:41.900
 is fairly easy to quit for most people?

1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:43.260
 No.

1:25:43.260 --> 1:25:45.340
 70% of people who smoke cigarettes report

1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:48.860
 that they would like to quit if they thought they could.

1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:51.120
 The success rate of quitting smoking

1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:53.120
 when people try to go just cold turkey,

1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:54.900
 just quit with no assistance whatsoever,

1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.220
 they might tell their family and friends,

1:25:56.220 --> 1:25:59.360
 hey, I'm quitting, that's it, is exceedingly low.

1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:01.360
 It's 5%.

1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.820
 So 5% of the people that say, that's it,

1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:08.220
 I'm not smoking again, despite cancer diagnosis,

1:26:08.220 --> 1:26:09.060
 I'm not smoking again,

1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:10.660
 despite the fear of the negative health effects,

1:26:10.660 --> 1:26:12.640
 I'm not going to ever smoke again,

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:16.060
 despite the financial costs, the health costs.

1:26:16.060 --> 1:26:18.220
 I mean, I could list off the huge number of things

1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:19.100
 that it does that are negative,

1:26:19.100 --> 1:26:21.020
 but you already know these or you've heard them.

1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:22.960
 It makes your skin worse.

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:26.840
 As I mentioned, it lowers libido, it disrupts hormones,

1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:30.600
 it disrupts vascular function, brain function,

1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:31.800
 it does all these terrible things,

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.240
 and yet most people who try and quit simply can't.

1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:36.940
 And of the 5% that succeed in quitting,

1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:40.540
 a full 65% of them relapse within a year.

1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:42.860
 So that's a very depressing picture,

1:26:42.860 --> 1:26:45.000
 but it's not to say that people cannot quit,

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:45.940
 and in fact, they can.

1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:47.480
 There are a couple of methods that have been shown

1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:49.420
 to help people quit.

1:26:49.420 --> 1:26:53.040
 Some are behavioral and some are pharmacologic.

1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:55.400
 I just want to touch on the behavioral ones first,

1:26:55.400 --> 1:26:58.820
 because it turns out that there's a quite powerful method

1:26:58.820 --> 1:27:01.240
 for quitting nicotine ingestion

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:02.740
 by way of cigarette smoking,

1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:04.720
 which also carries over to vaping.

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:07.480
 This is beautiful work that's been done by my colleague,

1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:08.720
 in fact, close collaborator,

1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:10.240
 although I was not involved in the research

1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:12.160
 that I'm about to describe, at Stanford,

1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:14.360
 and his name is Dr. David Spiegel.

1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:16.560
 He is our associate chair of psychiatry.

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:18.800
 He's been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:21.800
 and he is a world expert, if not the world expert,

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:24.120
 in the clinical applications of hypnosis.

1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:25.240
 Now, when I say hypnosis,

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:26.980
 a lot of people think stage hypnosis,

1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:28.540
 which is the hypnotist trying to get people

1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:30.920
 to do certain things and say certain things,

1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:32.920
 not necessarily against their will,

1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:34.120
 because they actually have to agree,

1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:36.000
 but the hypnotist is dictating

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.840
 what the person thinks, says, and does.

1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:41.860
 Clinical hypnosis is vastly different from that.

1:27:41.860 --> 1:27:45.000
 Clinical hypnosis is where the person, the patient,

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.880
 actually directs their own brain changes

1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:51.120
 toward a specific emotional or behavioral goal.

1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:55.360
 Work from Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory, done in 1993,

1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:57.620
 but that now has been repeated many, many times,

1:27:57.620 --> 1:27:59.480
 has carried over into some more modern studies,

1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:01.920
 and I will provide links to those studies

1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:04.740
 in the show note caption so that you can access them.

1:28:04.740 --> 1:28:06.000
 Those studies have shown

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.920
 that using a specific form of hypnosis,

1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:13.940
 people can achieve complete and total cessation

1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:15.680
 of cigarette smoking,

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:16.760
 and there's no reason to believe

1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:19.080
 this doesn't also carry over to vaping

1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:21.760
 through one single hypnosis session.

1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:24.360
 And the success rates are incredibly high

1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:25.800
 when one considers that normally

1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:28.280
 it would be only a 5% success rate.

1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:30.440
 The success rate with this particular hypnosis

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:32.280
 developed at Stanford School of Medicine

1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:35.920
 by Dr. David Spiegel is 23% of people

1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:39.600
 who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking.

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:43.580
 Now, in the old days, which actually wasn't that long ago,

1:28:43.580 --> 1:28:45.700
 before the advent of smartphones

1:28:45.700 --> 1:28:48.280
 and before the internet took off to the extent

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:49.360
 that it has now,

1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:52.700
 this was done by having someone come into the clinic,

1:28:52.700 --> 1:28:55.320
 and Dr. Spiegel himself or one of his colleagues

1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:57.360
 would take somebody through the hypnosis.

1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:00.560
 Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis.

1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:02.160
 There's a wonderful app

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:05.240
 that was developed by Dr. David Spiegel and others.

1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:07.840
 It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:10.000
 I've talked about this app a few times on the podcast before

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.280
 because there are hypnosis scripts within the app

1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:14.880
 for enhancing sleep, for improving ability to fall asleep

1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:16.480
 if you wake up in the middle of the night,

1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:18.160
 for focus and a number of other

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:20.520
 behavioral and emotional changes.

1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:23.000
 There's also a function in the Reveri app

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:24.660
 for smoking cessation,

1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:28.880
 which exactly parallels the sort of in laboratory

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.940
 and in clinic approaches that Dr. Spiegel would use

1:29:31.940 --> 1:29:34.440
 for you to show up at his clinic or in his laboratory.

1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:35.920
 And since that's not possible

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:37.860
 for the large number of people out there,

1:29:37.860 --> 1:29:40.720
 if you or somebody else is trying to quit smoking

1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:45.140
 or vaping or dipping or snuffing for that matter,

1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:47.840
 I strongly encourage you to check out the Reveri app.

1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:50.780
 You can find it easily by going to reveri.com.

1:29:50.780 --> 1:29:52.660
 It's available in various formats.

1:29:52.660 --> 1:29:54.000
 Some of it is available free,

1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:55.580
 some of it is behind a paywall,

1:29:55.580 --> 1:29:58.880
 but given the tremendously negative impact of smoking,

1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:00.420
 vaping, dipping, and snuffing,

1:30:01.260 --> 1:30:05.380
 the hypnosis for smoking cessation that Reveri has

1:30:05.380 --> 1:30:08.560
 seems at least to me as a very powerful

1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:09.600
 and worthwhile resource.

1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:11.080
 So please check that out if you're somebody

1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:13.860
 who's trying to quit ingesting nicotine

1:30:13.860 --> 1:30:16.600
 by any of the four methods that I just described.

1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:17.760
 Now, of course, there are other methods

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:19.760
 that people have used to successfully quit smoking

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:22.960
 or vaping or other forms of nicotine delivery.

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:25.380
 And there's actually an excellent review on this topic.

1:30:25.380 --> 1:30:27.240
 So before diving into a few of the specifics

1:30:27.240 --> 1:30:31.220
 about some of the pharmacology of using nicotine itself

1:30:31.220 --> 1:30:34.040
 to quit smoking or nicotine itself to quit vaping,

1:30:34.040 --> 1:30:35.720
 or the use of various things,

1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:40.360
 even SSRIs, antidepressants, to quit smoking or vaping,

1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:42.080
 I just want to point you to a review article

1:30:42.080 --> 1:30:43.680
 that if you'd like to get a complete survey

1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:45.600
 of all the options that are available,

1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:47.700
 there's an excellent review on this.

1:30:47.700 --> 1:30:50.160
 It was published just a couple of years ago in 2020.

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.600
 The title of the article is pharmacologic approach

1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:53.860
 to smoking cessation,

1:30:53.860 --> 1:30:56.560
 an updated review for daily clinical practice.

1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:59.840
 And even though this is mainly focused on smoking cessation,

1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:02.400
 it carries over quite nicely to vaping.

1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:04.240
 And it details a number of statistics,

1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:07.460
 the fact that every year 700,000 or more people die

1:31:07.460 --> 1:31:08.940
 because of smoking related diseases.

1:31:08.940 --> 1:31:12.000
 So there again, you have the negative health effects

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:13.340
 that younger people are smoking,

1:31:13.340 --> 1:31:14.940
 that women are smoking more nowadays,

1:31:14.940 --> 1:31:16.360
 and that even though you see less smoking

1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:18.000
 typically in the US and Canada,

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.900
 and even in Northern Europe, some places,

1:31:19.900 --> 1:31:21.400
 there's still many, many people are smoking

1:31:21.400 --> 1:31:22.680
 who would like to quit.

1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:24.800
 But that 75% of people,

1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:26.960
 at least according to this review earlier, I said 70%,

1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:29.640
 but estimates are as high as 75% of people

1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:32.720
 who try to quit smoking relapse within the first week.

1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:34.240
 The first week, they just go right back to it.

1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:36.780
 That's how powerfully reinforcing the nicotine is.

1:31:36.780 --> 1:31:38.680
 Remember, it's the nicotine in the cigarette

1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:39.880
 that's powerfully reinforcing,

1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:44.880
 but it's also the oral habit, the motor habit.

1:31:45.320 --> 1:31:47.780
 There is this thing about density of sensory receptors

1:31:47.780 --> 1:31:48.620
 in the lips.

1:31:48.620 --> 1:31:51.440
 People like bringing things to their lips,

1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:56.440
 food, cigarettes, other lips in some cases, et cetera.

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.960
 There is a reinforcement pathway related to that

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.440
 for sort of obvious adaptive reasons.

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:05.440
 And as a consequence, there is a reinforcement

1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:06.560
 both from the behavior

1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:09.140
 and from the dopamine released from the nicotine itself.

1:32:09.140 --> 1:32:10.520
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:12.680
 from the positive reinforcement

1:32:12.680 --> 1:32:13.920
 that comes from increased focus,

1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:15.240
 so the money that you make through work

1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:16.640
 or your attentional ability,

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:17.520
 or the fact that you're alert

1:32:17.520 --> 1:32:18.600
 and people feel you present,

1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:21.860
 all of that funnels back into positive reinforcement,

1:32:21.860 --> 1:32:23.760
 behavioral reinforcement,

1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:26.240
 and then what we would call addiction.

1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:28.520
 So this review covers all of that

1:32:28.520 --> 1:32:30.220
 and then steps beautifully

1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:33.760
 through nicotine replacement therapy and various compounds,

1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:35.740
 several of which I'm going to talk about now,

1:32:35.740 --> 1:32:37.980
 which have been shown to increase that number

1:32:37.980 --> 1:32:40.620
 that we talked about earlier of only 5% of people

1:32:40.620 --> 1:32:43.080
 who try to quit with no other support,

1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:44.880
 pharmacologic or hypnosis or otherwise,

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:47.040
 just say, that's it, I'm not going to smoke again,

1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:48.680
 or I'm not going to vape again.

1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:50.880
 Only 5% of people succeed in doing that.

1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:53.760
 And even among those, many end up relapsing later.

1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.860
 There are a couple of pharmacologic approaches.

1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:57.800
 One of the main ones that's received a lot of attention

1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.080
 in recent years is Bupriperone,

1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:04.080
 sometimes referred to by its commercial name, Wellbutrin.

1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:07.800
 Now, Bupriperone is a compound

1:33:07.800 --> 1:33:10.020
 that increases the release of dopamine

1:33:10.020 --> 1:33:11.900
 and to a lesser extent epinephrine

1:33:11.900 --> 1:33:13.600
 and some other neurochemicals as well.

1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:15.600
 It's used for the treatment of depression

1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:17.720
 and for smoking cessation.

1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:19.920
 Now, I want to point out again, I'm not a psychiatrist,

1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:22.120
 so I'm not telling you to take Bupriperone,

1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:24.520
 AKA Wellbutrin, but I'm going to give you a little bit

1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:26.640
 of the contour of what's typically done

1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:28.460
 in terms of Bupriperone administration

1:33:28.460 --> 1:33:30.360
 to help people get relief

1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:32.240
 from some of the withdrawal symptoms

1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:33.900
 of trying to quit smoking or vaping

1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:36.540
 or other forms of nicotine ingestion.

1:33:36.540 --> 1:33:38.760
 Typically, Bupriperone is taken

1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:41.440
 in 300 milligram per day doses

1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:44.160
 divided into two dosages of 150 milligrams each,

1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:47.200
 or sometimes there's a slow release formula.

1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.900
 The dosages will vary from person to person.

1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:51.400
 I want to really emphasize

1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:54.640
 that there is an increased seizure risk with Bupriperone.

1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:56.940
 It only occurs in a small fraction of the population,

1:33:56.940 --> 1:33:58.960
 but nonetheless is a real concern

1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:00.380
 for those members of the population.

1:34:00.380 --> 1:34:02.220
 So for those of you with seizure risk,

1:34:02.220 --> 1:34:03.620
 whether you know it or not,

1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:06.120
 that's going to be a valid concern

1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:07.960
 in terms of potential side effects.

1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:11.720
 The other thing about Bupriperone is that it has to be used

1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:13.720
 with caution in patients that have liver disease

1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:15.960
 or renal disease that can impact

1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:17.400
 the amount that anyone can take,

1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:19.660
 meaning sometimes people have to take a much lower dose

1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:22.200
 if they have renal disease or liver disease,

1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:23.900
 and sometimes they can't take it at all.

1:34:23.900 --> 1:34:26.240
 Sometimes if people are taking benzodiazepines

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:28.180
 for whatever reason or other sedatives,

1:34:28.180 --> 1:34:29.740
 there are contraindications there.

1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:33.360
 So Bupriperone isn't a kind of one-size-fits-all

1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:35.480
 or magic bullet for quitting smoking.

1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:38.040
 Nonetheless, for people that can take it safely,

1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:39.840
 and again, this is a prescription drug,

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:42.160
 a board certified psychiatrist or other physician

1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:43.560
 is going to have to prescribe it for you

1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:44.640
 if it's appropriate for you,

1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:47.440
 and it moves that number of 5% success rate

1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:50.520
 to about what one sees with the clinical hypnosis

1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:53.320
 to about 20% of people

1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:56.760
 will successfully overcome their nicotine,

1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:00.240
 or I should say their smoking or vaping addiction.

1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:03.080
 Now it's important to ask why this would work, right?

1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:05.160
 I mean, it's not as if Bupriperone

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:08.200
 is increasing nicotine per se.

1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:09.560
 What it's doing is it's tapping

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:12.280
 on that mesolimbic reward pathway, increasing dopamine,

1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:13.760
 or at least allowing dopamine levels

1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:16.560
 to stay substantially elevated enough

1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:19.880
 that people don't experience some of the drop in dopamine

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:21.380
 that leads to the withdrawal symptoms,

1:35:21.380 --> 1:35:22.840
 the lessening of mood, et cetera,

1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:24.600
 and it's no coincidence that Bupriperone

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:26.400
 is also an antidepressant.

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:27.920
 It's a common antidepressant

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:29.720
 for people that experience negative side effects

1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:31.320
 with the so-called SSRIs,

1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:33.840
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:35.360
 that prevent them from taking those things

1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:37.160
 like lessen libido or appetite,

1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:39.280
 or in some cases increased appetite,

1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:41.620
 or any number of other side effects that some people,

1:35:41.620 --> 1:35:43.720
 not all, but some people experience with SSRIs.

1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:46.680
 They'll be prescribed Wellbutrin, Bupriperone

1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:48.160
 is the generic name.

1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:49.880
 So Wellbutrin being the commercial name,

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:53.140
 again, Bupriperone is what they'll be prescribed instead.

1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:57.560
 With the caveats of seizure risk, renal disease,

1:35:57.560 --> 1:35:58.880
 liver disease, et cetera,

1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:02.400
 the outcomes with Wellbutrin for smoking cessation

1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:03.240
 are pretty good.

1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:05.920
 I mean, if you think about an increase from 5% to 20%,

1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:07.080
 that's pretty dramatic,

1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:10.320
 and yet I also want to refer back to the incredible success

1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:12.080
 of the clinical hypnosis approach.

1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:14.680
 Again, you can find that at reverie.com.

1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:18.800
 The clinical hypnosis approach has a success rate of 23%.

1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:20.740
 So it's very closely aligned with,

1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:24.400
 if not exceeding the success rate with Bupriperone.

1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:26.560
 Of course, there are other pharmacologic approaches

1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:29.580
 to quitting smoking or vaping.

1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:33.020
 All of them generally circle back to increasing dopamine

1:36:33.020 --> 1:36:34.360
 and or norepinephrine

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:37.000
 in order to offset some of the withdrawal symptoms

1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.680
 of smoking sensation or vaping cessation.

1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:42.740
 A very common approach for people to try and quit smoking

1:36:42.740 --> 1:36:46.860
 or vaping is to use nicotine itself

1:36:46.860 --> 1:36:49.820
 to try and prevent people from seeking nicotine

1:36:49.820 --> 1:36:52.260
 through a cigarette or a vape pen.

1:36:52.260 --> 1:36:55.240
 What I mean by that is people using a nicotine patch

1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:59.040
 or nicotine gum or other nicotine delivery device

1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:01.980
 that is not cigarettes and not vaping

1:37:01.980 --> 1:37:05.200
 in order to maintain levels of nicotine

1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:07.060
 in their bloodstream,

1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:09.240
 which of course means maintain levels of nicotine

1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:11.160
 in their brain and body

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.040
 to the same extent that they would

1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:15.000
 if they were smoking or vaping,

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:18.960
 maybe even gradually taking down the total amount of nicotine

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:22.680
 in their brain and body by reducing the number

1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.400
 or size of nicotine gum pieces that they ingest each day

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:29.000
 or keeping the patch on for a shorter amount of time

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.340
 or getting a lower dose patch

1:37:30.340 --> 1:37:34.300
 that releases less nicotine total or over time.

1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:37.180
 All of those approaches have been shown

1:37:37.180 --> 1:37:39.120
 to be reasonably successful.

1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:40.160
 I'll get to the numbers in a few minutes,

1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:43.320
 but reasonably successful in allowing people

1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:47.120
 to quit smoking or vaping.

1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:49.740
 Again, most of the data is on cigarette smoking

1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:52.200
 because vaping is a relatively new phenomenon,

1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:54.440
 although quite troublingly,

1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:57.800
 it's a very rapidly increasing behavior,

1:37:57.800 --> 1:37:59.300
 especially in the young population.

1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:01.420
 So that's why I'm kind of lumping these two things together

1:38:01.420 --> 1:38:05.400
 because I think very soon we are going to need

1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:09.560
 an all out campaign for how to counter vaping addiction.

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:11.900
 So what do we know about smoking sensation

1:38:11.900 --> 1:38:13.520
 using nicotine itself?

1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:14.780
 Is the patch best?

1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:16.520
 Is nicotine gum best?

1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:20.500
 It turns out that a combination of approaches is best.

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:21.600
 So somewhat surprising,

1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:22.820
 but it was very clear from the literature

1:38:22.820 --> 1:38:26.160
 that I was able to find that using nicotine patches

1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:29.080
 for some period of time and then switching to a gum

1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.120
 and then perhaps switching to a nasal spray,

1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:34.940
 that's going to be the most effective.

1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:38.080
 Then the question is how long to continue each of those

1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:39.580
 and whether or not to overlap them.

1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:42.080
 It seems as if doing one for about a week

1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:43.680
 and then switching to another for about a week

1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:46.880
 and then switching to another is one rational

1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:47.780
 and reasonable approach

1:38:47.780 --> 1:38:50.160
 that many people have used successfully.

1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:51.000
 Why would that be?

1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:52.720
 Well, it all has to do with the different rates

1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:55.400
 of absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream

1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:57.720
 and then the downstream consequences of that

1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:00.420
 on the dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine,

1:39:00.420 --> 1:39:02.600
 and other systems of the brain and body.

1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:05.960
 And while there hasn't been an extremely detailed study

1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:08.840
 of the exact kinetics of how the nasal sprays

1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:11.400
 versus the transdermal patches versus the gums, et cetera,

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:13.520
 work, there's a logical structure to it

1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:14.840
 that will immediately make sense to you.

1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:17.300
 First of all, the transdermal patches

1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:20.140
 provide a fairly steady state dopamine release

1:39:20.140 --> 1:39:21.380
 across the day.

1:39:21.380 --> 1:39:23.760
 And oftentimes people are wearing them at night as well.

1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:26.800
 This is relevant because if people are ingesting nicotine

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:29.300
 by way of smoking and vaping,

1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:31.920
 hopefully they're not waking up in the middle of the night

1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:33.300
 just to smoke or vape, or believe it or not,

1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:34.160
 some people do that.

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:36.360
 But of course, while people are asleep,

1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.520
 they are not smoking or vaping.

1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:39.440
 They always tell you don't fall asleep

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:40.260
 with a cigarette in your mouth,

1:39:40.260 --> 1:39:42.300
 you burn the whole house down.

1:39:42.300 --> 1:39:45.480
 But exceedingly rare to have people

1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:47.000
 who are smoking in their sleep.

1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:48.560
 So people wake up in the morning

1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:51.520
 and because the half-life of nicotine from smoking or vaping

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:54.000
 is very short, anywhere from one to two hours,

1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.620
 they are essentially in a state of withdrawal

1:39:55.620 --> 1:39:57.000
 at the point where they wake up in the morning.

1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:57.820
 How can I say that?

1:39:57.820 --> 1:40:00.440
 Well, remember withdrawal sets in about four hours

1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:03.160
 after the last ingestion of nicotine by cigarette

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:05.060
 or by inhalation from the vape pen.

1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:07.720
 So people are waking up in nicotine withdrawal

1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:09.520
 and then immediately going into

1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:10.920
 the behavior of ingesting nicotine

1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:13.600
 or very soon after waking for most people.

1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:16.560
 So nicotine patch is going to be very effective

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:17.600
 for a week or so.

1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:18.620
 Again, talk to your physician

1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:20.480
 about the best approach for this,

1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:23.900
 but then switching to a nasal spray

1:40:23.900 --> 1:40:26.140
 or switching to nicotine gum for about a week,

1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:27.600
 which is going to change the kinetics

1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.680
 of that nicotine absorption to the bloodstream

1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:32.120
 and change the release of dopamine

1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:33.760
 and other neurochemicals within the brain.

1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:37.200
 That's going to keep the system intentionally off balance

1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:40.880
 so that it never comes to expect one single pattern

1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:44.020
 or amplitude of dopamine release.

1:40:44.020 --> 1:40:47.640
 And that is a very powerful way for a,

1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:51.700
 let's just call it a quitting method to work

1:40:51.700 --> 1:40:53.320
 because as I've always said,

1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:56.240
 the most powerful schedule of dopamine

1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:59.120
 is going to be this random intermittent reward.

1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:00.880
 This is what's used in the casinos

1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:02.080
 in order to take your money.

1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:03.760
 And generally they do on average,

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.320
 they take your money more than you take theirs

1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:09.360
 and they take more of it, not just more often,

1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:11.840
 because they use this random intermittent schedule.

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:13.860
 The random intermittent schedule is one in which

1:41:13.860 --> 1:41:15.940
 you don't really know when the peaks in dopamine

1:41:15.940 --> 1:41:17.300
 are going to arrive.

1:41:17.300 --> 1:41:19.800
 And so there isn't this expectation and craving.

1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:21.480
 And then all of a sudden when dopamine is released,

1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:22.380
 it's extremely high.

1:41:22.380 --> 1:41:23.760
 That's how they get you to continue playing

1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:25.320
 even though basically you're losing money

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:26.320
 and your dopamine is dropping.

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:29.240
 They elevate it every once in a while.

1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:31.740
 Nicotine replacement can be used in a similar way,

1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:34.720
 but in a benevolent way in order to help you get over

1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:37.560
 smoking or vaping by keeping the total amounts

1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:40.720
 of dopamine variable around the clock.

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:43.560
 And by changing the amount of dopamine that's released,

1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:46.960
 it seems to help people behaviorally and psychologically

1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:48.400
 because they don't come to expect

1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:49.920
 having a particular amount of dopamine

1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:51.720
 in their brain and blood at any given time.

1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:54.960
 And this is an important point because it brings us

1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:56.820
 to this notion of homeostasis.

1:41:56.820 --> 1:41:59.480
 Homeostasis is this tendency for biological systems

1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:01.120
 to try and reach equilibrium.

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:02.560
 What goes up, goes down, et cetera,

1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:04.840
 and to some extent to the same degree.

1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:06.400
 So I'll talk about this right now in the context

1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:09.840
 of nicotine use, withdrawal,

1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:12.280
 and then the period in which people

1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:14.500
 no longer crave nicotine.

1:42:14.500 --> 1:42:16.940
 So you can imagine that if we were to measure

1:42:16.940 --> 1:42:18.440
 your heart rate, your blood pressure,

1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:21.260
 and your overall levels of alertness and wellbeing and mood,

1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:23.080
 let's just give that some value.

1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:24.720
 Let's say it runs from zero to 10.

1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:25.760
 Again, arbitrary units.

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:28.000
 Let's just take all those physiological measures

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.640
 and the subjective measure of your mood,

1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:33.940
 and let's measure it four times an hour across the day,

1:42:33.940 --> 1:42:34.960
 across the waking hours.

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:36.920
 What we would find is a line that would kind of

1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:39.160
 squiggle a bit, maybe a nice text comes in

1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:42.000
 that you really like, maybe you get a not so good news

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.320
 and your kind of autonomic arousal is all over the place.

1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:47.500
 But on average, it's kind of a squiggly line

1:42:47.500 --> 1:42:48.800
 where it increases in the morning

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:50.720
 because that's typically when body temperature

1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:52.160
 and autonomic arousal increase.

1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:53.240
 And then towards the afternoon,

1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:54.260
 it's going to come sloping down.

1:42:54.260 --> 1:42:56.320
 And then right before sleep, there'll be an increase again.

1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:57.160
 If you've ever felt that,

1:42:57.160 --> 1:42:58.320
 you kind of run around a lot before sleep,

1:42:58.320 --> 1:42:59.280
 and then it goes down.

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:03.200
 That's kind of the typical contour of autonomic arousal,

1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:05.720
 mood, et cetera, across the day.

1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:07.760
 Removing, of course, life events

1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:11.000
 and things like psychiatric illness and depression

1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.920
 and et cetera, that's the typical arc of that.

1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:18.040
 Now let's superimpose on whatever that contour is for you,

1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:18.860
 nicotine.

1:43:18.860 --> 1:43:21.740
 So get a little bolus, as we say,

1:43:21.740 --> 1:43:23.920
 a little bit of nicotine from smoking a cigarette

1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:25.640
 or from taking inhalation on a vape pen.

1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:27.360
 What ends up happening is there's an increase

1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:28.760
 in blood pressure, increase in heart rate,

1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:30.360
 increase in mood, increase in alertness,

1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:32.260
 all the things we talked about earlier.

1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:37.200
 Over time, the body starts to adjust

1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:40.800
 so that the baseline upon which

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:45.320
 that nicotine-induced increase in arousal would occur

1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:47.600
 is actually reduced, right?

1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:48.440
 Why would that be?

1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:51.140
 Well, the body and the brain,

1:43:51.140 --> 1:43:53.000
 your physiology seeks homeostasis.

1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.020
 So if there's a big increase in all those things

1:43:56.020 --> 1:43:57.920
 like blood pressure and mood, et cetera,

1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:00.700
 typically your baseline will drop a little bit

1:44:00.700 --> 1:44:02.200
 to compensate for that over time

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:05.020
 after a couple of days or even weeks of ingesting nicotine.

1:44:05.020 --> 1:44:06.140
 So let's say you wake up,

1:44:06.140 --> 1:44:08.840
 you typically take an inhalation off your vape

1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:11.640
 or you have a cigarette around nine or 10 a.m.

1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.280
 and you do that daily.

1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:15.720
 You get used to a certain level of mood and alertness

1:44:15.720 --> 1:44:17.400
 and wellbeing for that time of day.

1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:20.120
 And then if you smoke again in the afternoon, let's say,

1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:21.960
 you also get accustomed to a certain level

1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:25.040
 of mood and alertness and wellbeing for that time of day.

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:26.820
 Again, it'll vary depending on life events,

1:44:26.820 --> 1:44:28.440
 but your system sort of gets used to it

1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:31.000
 and your baseline will drop to compensate for those peaks

1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.180
 so that the peaks aren't quite as high as they were

1:44:33.180 --> 1:44:35.280
 when you first started using nicotine.

1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:36.440
 Now you decide to quit.

1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:38.440
 So now what we're talking about is transitioning

1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:40.580
 from the consumption

1:44:40.580 --> 1:44:43.100
 to what we're going to call the withdrawal phase.

1:44:43.100 --> 1:44:44.600
 Now what happens is you say, that's it,

1:44:44.600 --> 1:44:46.120
 I'm going cold turkey.

1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:47.800
 I know there's only a 5% success rate,

1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:49.000
 but I'm going to just go cold turkey.

1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:50.760
 Or somebody will say, no,

1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:52.000
 I'm going to use the Reverie app.

1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:53.720
 Or somebody says, no,

1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:55.920
 I'm going to use buprenorphine or another method

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:57.920
 or nicotine patch or something of that sort.

1:44:57.920 --> 1:44:59.640
 Well, setting aside the nicotine patch

1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:01.500
 or the nicotine delivery device,

1:45:01.500 --> 1:45:04.200
 and only focusing on approaches

1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:05.860
 for getting through withdrawal

1:45:05.860 --> 1:45:09.240
 that have no direct effects on nicotine, okay?

1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:10.620
 So not using the nicotine patch,

1:45:10.620 --> 1:45:14.160
 but say the hypnosis or buprenorphine,

1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:15.540
 which can increase dopamine,

1:45:15.540 --> 1:45:18.400
 but it doesn't increase nicotine directly.

1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:19.440
 What happens?

1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:21.020
 The day that you quit,

1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:25.120
 that homeostatic mechanism in your brain and body

1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:27.900
 that sets your level of mood and arousal, et cetera,

1:45:27.900 --> 1:45:30.920
 does not know and hasn't adjusted to the fact

1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:32.340
 that you're not bringing in nicotine.

1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:33.440
 You're not having that cigarette.

1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:35.840
 You're not having that inhalation on the vape pen.

1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:38.080
 So what ends up happening is that baseline,

1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:41.560
 which has been adjusted down to offset the increases

1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:43.680
 in mood and alertness, et cetera,

1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:48.280
 when you smoke or vape is lower than it normally would be.

1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:52.900
 So that 9 a.m. cigarette time or vape inhalation time

1:45:52.900 --> 1:45:55.440
 no longer feels above baseline.

1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:57.400
 It actually feels below baseline

1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:02.400
 because what you're seeing is the lower amplitude of arousal

1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:05.880
 that was there to offset the increase you were getting

1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:07.240
 from vaping or smoking.

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:08.320
 And then in the afternoon,

1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:10.480
 if normally you have a kind of phase of your afternoon

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:11.720
 you really enjoy, you go outside,

1:46:11.720 --> 1:46:13.480
 you have a vape or a cigarette,

1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:14.760
 you normally are feeling relaxed

1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:16.040
 or you go out at night and you'd like to vape

1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:18.040
 and you say, nope, I'm not going to do that anymore,

1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:20.960
 you're going to feel much, much worse

1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:23.400
 than you would have had you never started smoking or vaping.

1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:25.880
 Now that's not much help to anyone

1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:27.780
 who's already started smoking or vaping,

1:46:27.780 --> 1:46:30.840
 but I say this because it's very important to understand

1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:32.520
 that the reason why relapse rates

1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:34.000
 are so high within the first week,

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.880
 75% of people relapse within one week

1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:39.960
 and overall failure rates are 95%

1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:43.240
 is because people don't expect to feel even worse

1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:46.040
 than they did prior to ever smoking or vaping.

1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:48.760
 So that first week is absolutely critical.

1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:50.220
 And the beauty of understanding this

1:46:50.220 --> 1:46:52.600
 is that if you can get through that first week

1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:55.840
 either by sheer grit or by finding other methods

1:46:55.840 --> 1:46:58.800
 to increase dopamine, healthy methods, I would hope,

1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:01.040
 and certainly cold showers, ice baths

1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:03.560
 have been shown to do that by the way.

1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:05.360
 This was described in Dr. Anna Lemke's book,

1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:07.360
 ''Dopamine Nation''.

1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:09.520
 Cold showers can increase dopamine exercise,

1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:11.360
 positive social interactions.

1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:13.780
 It's very likely that people will need to use

1:47:13.780 --> 1:47:17.160
 other healthy methods to offset that reduction in dopamine

1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:19.800
 if ever they stand to get through that first week.

1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:22.340
 And again, if you can get through that first week,

1:47:22.340 --> 1:47:24.280
 chances are quite a bit higher

1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.260
 that you'll be able to maintain

1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:29.080
 the cessation of smoking or vaping.

1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:31.040
 And of course, hypnosis,

1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:33.240
 things like buprenparone can also assist in that.

1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:34.840
 Buprenparone by way of increasing

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.240
 dopamine pharmacologically,

1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:39.100
 hypnosis through changes in neural circuitry

1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:40.340
 that aren't completely understood,

1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:42.480
 but seem to involve a remapping

1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:44.800
 of some of the so-called default networks

1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:46.400
 and some of the networks that are involved

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:48.880
 in kind of understanding of your own internal state.

1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:50.040
 This stuff gets a little bit complicated

1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:50.920
 and we're going to return to this

1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:54.160
 in an upcoming episode of the Huberton Lab Podcast,

1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:56.840
 but there are indeed legitimate changes

1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:59.680
 in neural circuitry caused by clinical hypnosis

1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:01.280
 that can at least partially explain

1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:04.320
 why it is so effective in helping treat

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:07.000
 or allow people to stop smoking and vaping.

1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:08.400
 So for those of you out there

1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:11.760
 that either hear or are saying yourselves,

1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:15.200
 I just can't seem to quit smoking or vaping

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:17.280
 or dipping or snuffing,

1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:18.880
 hopefully an understanding

1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:21.280
 of how that homeostasis process works

1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:23.440
 and the time course of nicotine,

1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:25.160
 depending on the delivery device,

1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:26.680
 hopefully understanding that

1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:29.880
 will allow you to develop a protocol,

1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:30.960
 maybe it involves hypnosis,

1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:32.560
 maybe it involves just understanding

1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:36.820
 that the typical times in which you ingested nicotine

1:48:36.820 --> 1:48:38.320
 through any of the different approaches

1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:40.040
 of bringing it into your system

1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:41.300
 are going to be particularly hard,

1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:43.160
 but I don't just mean particularly hard,

1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:44.000
 I mean particularly hard

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.080
 and you're going to need to do something specific

1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:50.520
 to offset that decrease in overall autonomic arousal

1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:52.160
 and dopamine, et cetera.

1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:53.440
 Hopefully an understanding of that

1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:55.020
 will allow you to get through that first week

1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:56.880
 and if you can make it past that first week,

1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:59.680
 you stand a very good chance of never going back.

1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:02.400
 However, I did consult with Dr. David Spiegel

1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:04.340
 in anticipation of this episode,

1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:07.200
 regardless of the method that you used

1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:11.960
 to quit smoking or vaping, snuffing or dipping.

1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:15.520
 There's good evidence that a routine,

1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:17.700
 maybe once a month or even once a week

1:49:17.700 --> 1:49:20.800
 hypnosis type approach

1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:23.480
 to replenish or even enhance the neural circuits

1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:25.640
 that are allowing you to stay away from nicotine

1:49:25.640 --> 1:49:27.080
 is going to be a very good idea.

1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:31.400
 And given that it's a purely behavioral intervention,

1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:33.000
 I can see no reason as to why

1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:34.000
 people wouldn't want to do that.

1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.700
 Go in and reinforce, tighten the bolts on that circuitry

1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:39.840
 that are allowing you to not feel the impulse to smoke,

1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:41.560
 not feel the impulse to vape.

1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.840
 And just a very brief mention,

1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:46.540
 there is a vast literature on the fact

1:49:46.540 --> 1:49:48.820
 that when people have quit smoking or vaping

1:49:48.820 --> 1:49:51.360
 or other form of consuming nicotine,

1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:52.720
 that when they consume alcohol,

1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:54.340
 there's a much higher probability of relapse.

1:49:54.340 --> 1:49:56.160
 There are interactions between alcohol and nicotine

1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:57.840
 that we'll cover in future episodes.

1:49:57.840 --> 1:49:59.400
 But for those of you that want to quit,

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:00.760
 I want to assure you,

1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:03.400
 despite the fact that 95% of people fail

1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:05.000
 with the appropriate tools,

1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.560
 and I like to think with an additional understanding

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:09.580
 of the underlying biology and psychology

1:50:09.580 --> 1:50:11.880
 and what you can expect and when to really dig your heels

1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:14.120
 and when to reinforce your system with more dopamine

1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:16.160
 through any of the number of the different protocols

1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:17.600
 and tools that we've offered here

1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:18.680
 and that you can find elsewhere

1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:21.200
 and other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:22.940
 I have a high degree of confidence

1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:27.640
 that you can quit smoking or vaping, dipping or snuffing.

1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:29.280
 So today, typical of, frankly,

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:30.840
 all episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:33.440
 we've covered a lot about the biology

1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:34.680
 of a particular system.

1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.000
 We talked about the biology of nicotine in particular.

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.120
 We talked about vaping and smoking, dipping and snuffing,

1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:45.420
 and the negative health consequences associated with those.

1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:48.000
 I want to reemphasize that nicotine is not

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.460
 what causes cancer, it is the delivery device

1:50:50.460 --> 1:50:53.440
 that causes cancer and the other negative health effects.

1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:56.440
 That is not to say that people should be ingesting nicotine

1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:57.360
 through any different methods

1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:58.840
 simply to get a cognitive boost.

1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:00.160
 There are certain circumstances

1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:01.920
 where that might be appropriate,

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:03.440
 for the occasional work bout,

1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:05.980
 certainly not for physical exercise,

1:51:05.980 --> 1:51:07.640
 given what we talked about earlier.

1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:09.860
 But of course, there are more and more approaches

1:51:09.860 --> 1:51:12.060
 to increasing, not just nicotine,

1:51:12.060 --> 1:51:13.760
 but acetylcholine generally,

1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:15.360
 in order to achieve cognitive enhancement

1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:16.520
 or physical enhancement,

1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:19.300
 or I should say physical performance enhancement.

1:51:19.300 --> 1:51:22.020
 Some of those we talked about earlier, such as alpha-GPC.

1:51:22.020 --> 1:51:25.560
 In any event, nicotine, it should now be clear,

1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:27.800
 is an immensely powerful substance,

1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:29.940
 one of the most commonly ingested substances

1:51:29.940 --> 1:51:32.800
 on the face of the earth and has been for a very long time.

1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:34.820
 And now that you understand the underlying biology

1:51:34.820 --> 1:51:36.280
 and the way in which it changes

1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:38.100
 your psychology and physiology,

1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:39.760
 that should come as no surprise.

1:51:39.760 --> 1:51:41.920

 That is the best way to support this podcast.

1:52:09.860 --> 1:52:12.400
 During today's episode and on various previous episodes

1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:14.560
 of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.

1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:16.520
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:18.500
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:52:18.500 --> 1:52:21.600
 for things like enhancing sleep, hormone function,

1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:22.880
 focus, and so on.

1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:24.280
 The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered

1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:28.120
 with Momentous Supplements, spelled Momentous O-U-S.

1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:29.480
 You can find those supplements

1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:32.340
 at livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

1:52:32.340 --> 1:52:33.520

 We provide summaries of different podcasts

1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:41.860
 and we provide summaries of specific tools

1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:43.760
 that you can use to enhance sleep, for instance,

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:45.280
 or enhance dopamine.

1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:46.820
 We talk about deliberate cold exposure,

1:52:46.820 --> 1:52:47.860
 deliberate heat exposure.

1:52:47.860 --> 1:52:49.200
 It's very easy to sign up for

 we are Huberman Lab on Twitter, Huberman Lab on Instagram,

1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:11.200
 and Huberman Lab on Facebook.

1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:12.720
 And at all of those locations,

1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:14.600
 I describe science and science-related tools,

1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:16.320
 some of which overlap with the content

1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:17.680
 of the Huberman Lab podcast,

1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:20.060
 much of which is distinct from the content covered

1:53:20.060 --> 1:53:21.620
 on the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:53:21.620 --> 1:53:23.800
 So once again, I'd like to thank you for joining me today

1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:25.560
 for a discussion about the biology

1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:27.440
 and psychological effects of nicotine,

1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:29.360
 this incredibly powerful substance.

1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:32.300
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
