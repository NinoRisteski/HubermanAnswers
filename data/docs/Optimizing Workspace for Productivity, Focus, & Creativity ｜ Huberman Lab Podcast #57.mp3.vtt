00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.140
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.900
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.900 --> 00:14.740
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.220
 Today, we're going to talk all about

00:16.220 --> 00:19.840
 how to optimize your workspace for maximum productivity.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.780
 Indeed, that means to heighten levels of focus,

00:22.780 --> 00:25.080
 to increase levels of creativity,

00:25.080 --> 00:27.500
 to improve your ability to task switch.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.020
 And this could be for say, go school or for work,

00:30.020 --> 00:32.280
 creative endeavors, personal endeavors.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.120
 This really extends to everybody.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.280
 Most often when we hear about how to focus

00:36.280 --> 00:39.060
 or how to get the most out of our work sessions,

00:39.060 --> 00:42.520
 we hear about the biology and the psychology of that.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.960
 We hear about dopamine and we hear about serotonin

00:44.960 --> 00:46.420
 and we hear about caffeine.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.460
 And indeed, those are topics that I've covered a lot

00:48.460 --> 00:50.140
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:50.140 --> 00:51.780
 Today, we will touch on each of those,

00:51.780 --> 00:53.600
 but we are mainly going to focus on

00:53.600 --> 00:56.140
 how we arrange our physical environment

00:56.140 --> 00:58.020
 and indeed how we arrange ourselves

00:58.020 --> 00:59.540
 in that physical environment

00:59.540 --> 01:02.700
 in order to bring out the best in our neurobiology.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.300
 That is how to put ourselves into a heightened state

01:05.300 --> 01:07.180
 of focus by virtue of things

01:07.180 --> 01:10.620
 as simple as where we place our screen relative to our eyes

01:10.620 --> 01:11.900
 at a given time of day.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.120
 Believe it or not, there's excellent research on this

01:14.120 --> 01:15.900
 and there's excellent research, for instance,

01:15.900 --> 01:18.280
 on whether or not you should or should not listen to music,

01:18.280 --> 01:21.020
 whether or not you should use things like binaural beats,

01:21.020 --> 01:23.300
 and if so, what frequency of binaural beats.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.820
 We are going to cover all of that.

01:24.820 --> 01:27.080
 And by the end, you will have a checklist of things

01:27.080 --> 01:31.200
 that you can do to optimize your workspace on any budget.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.980
 I will mention various products and apps

01:32.980 --> 01:34.420
 that some of you might find useful

01:34.420 --> 01:36.500
 for optimizing your workspace,

01:36.500 --> 01:38.100
 but I want to emphasize at the outset

01:38.100 --> 01:40.460
 that none of those that I mentioned

01:40.460 --> 01:41.940
 are any products or apps

01:41.940 --> 01:43.900
 that we have a financial relationship to.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.340
 And more importantly, you don't need them.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.140
 I'm going to explain how for zero cost,

01:49.140 --> 01:51.060
 you can arrange your workspace in ways

01:51.060 --> 01:54.340
 that makes you maximally productive, maximally focused,

01:54.340 --> 01:56.620
 and allows you to adapt your workspace

01:56.620 --> 01:58.560
 to different environments, whether or not you're traveling,

01:58.560 --> 02:01.140
 working with others, working alone, et cetera.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.380
 Just to give you a little hint of where we are going,

02:03.380 --> 02:05.980
 I will mention a zero cost app

02:05.980 --> 02:09.340
 that will deliver binaural beats at a particular frequency

02:09.340 --> 02:11.480
 that peer-reviewed research has shown

02:11.480 --> 02:13.880
 can enhance certain types of learning and memory.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.420
 However, peer-reviewed research also shows

02:16.420 --> 02:19.980
 that it can diminish performance in other types of tasks.

02:19.980 --> 02:22.060
 So stay tuned, we'll go into all the details

02:22.060 --> 02:24.220
 so that you can optimize your workspace

02:24.220 --> 02:26.040
 for zero cost and get the most out

02:26.040 --> 02:27.900
 of your efforts and endeavors.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.640
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

02:29.640 --> 02:31.040
 that this podcast is separate

02:31.040 --> 02:33.280
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.340
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:35.340 --> 02:37.920
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:37.920 --> 02:40.500
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.540
 In keeping with that theme,

02:41.540 --> 02:44.460
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.580
 Our first sponsor is Element.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.460
 Element is an electrolyte drink

02:48.460 --> 02:50.340
 that has everything you need

02:50.340 --> 02:51.700
 and none of the things you don't.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.720
 And when we say everything you need,

02:53.720 --> 02:55.940
 the main one is salt.

02:55.940 --> 02:59.760
 Now, salt, AKA sodium, has kind of a bad rap.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.340
 We've all heard that too much salt is bad for us.

03:02.340 --> 03:05.060
 However, if you look into the research on salt,

03:05.060 --> 03:08.260
 and in fact, if you go to one of the highest-level

03:08.260 --> 03:11.500
 peer-reviewed scientific publications, Science Magazine,

03:11.500 --> 03:14.780
 you can find a review article in Science some years ago

03:14.780 --> 03:17.020
 that shows that most of what we think and understand

03:17.020 --> 03:19.380
 about the science of salt is completely wrong.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.220
 And in fact, salt does a number of things

03:21.220 --> 03:22.380
 that's extremely important.

03:22.380 --> 03:24.500
 For instance, our neurons,

03:24.500 --> 03:26.780
 which signal to one another through electricity

03:26.780 --> 03:28.220
 and through chemical signaling,

03:28.220 --> 03:31.180
 critically rely on having enough sodium

03:31.180 --> 03:33.300
 in order to generate what we call action potentials

03:33.300 --> 03:34.860
 or electrical firing of neurons.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.340
 If your sodium levels are too low,

03:36.340 --> 03:38.300
 your neurons simply won't work.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.120
 One of the main deficits from being dehydrated

03:41.120 --> 03:44.520
 is lack of sodium, not just lack of water.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.340
 Getting sufficient sodium does a number of things

03:46.340 --> 03:47.340
 that's very important.

03:47.340 --> 03:48.820
 It can raise your blood volume.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.740
 It can help you retain water in a healthy way,

03:50.740 --> 03:51.880
 not excess amounts.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.260
 It allows neurons to fire for sake of thinking,

03:54.260 --> 03:56.540
 for sake of athletic performance, and so on.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.340
 Other electrolytes that are in Element

03:58.340 --> 04:00.400
 are things like magnesium and potassium,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.460
 which are also essential for neuronal function

04:02.460 --> 04:04.900
 and indeed all organ function.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.220
 Element has a lot of salt, some magnesium,

04:07.220 --> 04:08.460
 and some potassium.

04:08.460 --> 04:09.300
 So unless you're somebody

04:09.300 --> 04:11.040
 who really has chronic hypertension,

04:11.040 --> 04:14.040
 elevating your level of salt intake can often be beneficial.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.260
 You should check with your doctor,

04:15.260 --> 04:17.600
 but indeed it can often be beneficial.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.340
 Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio

04:20.340 --> 04:23.020
 of 1000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,

04:23.020 --> 04:24.660
 200 milligrams of potassium,

04:24.660 --> 04:26.580
 and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.580
 It tastes delicious.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.580
 I happen to like the raspberry or citrus flavors.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.200
 In fact, I like all of the flavors.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.780
 Put in some water.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.540
 You can make it as dense,

04:34.540 --> 04:36.760
 meaning as high concentration as you like.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.640
 So some people will put it in eight ounces of water.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.380
 I like mine in about 16 ounces of water

04:40.380 --> 04:42.500
 and I'll drink that before and after exercise.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.460
 And I usually will have another one throughout the day,

04:44.460 --> 04:46.860
 just sip on it as I'm doing work and so forth.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.100

05:03.340 --> 05:06.000
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.300
 now referred to as AG1.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.420
 I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.

05:11.420 --> 05:13.740
 And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.340
 The reason I started taking AG1

05:15.340 --> 05:18.140
 and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day

05:18.140 --> 05:20.260
 is that it helps me meet all of my foundational

05:20.260 --> 05:22.220
 vitamin, mineral and probiotic needs.

05:22.220 --> 05:23.220
 And when people ask me,

05:23.220 --> 05:25.100
 what's the one supplement I should take?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.820
 If they were to only take one supplement,

05:26.820 --> 05:31.500
 I always recommend AG1 for the simple reason that vitamins,

05:31.500 --> 05:34.460
 the minerals and the probiotics support metabolic health,

05:34.460 --> 05:37.380
 they support endocrine health, they support brain health

05:37.380 --> 05:40.400
 and the probiotics and prebiotics in there in particular

05:40.400 --> 05:42.740
 support the so-called gut brain axis.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.780
 There is now a plethora of data supporting the fact

05:45.780 --> 05:47.960
 that when we have a healthy gut microbiome,

05:47.960 --> 05:49.460
 that is little microbes that live in our gut

05:49.460 --> 05:52.180
 that are good for us, our gut signals to our brain

05:52.180 --> 05:53.500
 and our brain signals back to our gut

05:53.500 --> 05:55.180
 in ways that support our immune system,

05:55.180 --> 05:57.540
 our digestion, even our mood.

05:57.540 --> 06:00.100
 They can even support healthy levels of dopamine signaling,

06:00.100 --> 06:02.260
 an important molecule for motivation

06:02.260 --> 06:04.760
 and high levels of mood or positive mood.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.120

06:15.420 --> 06:18.320
 Vitamin D3K2 has been shown to be important

06:18.320 --> 06:20.140
 for metabolic health, endocrine health

06:20.140 --> 06:21.980
 and K2 in particular for heart health

06:21.980 --> 06:25.580
 and regulating appropriate amounts of calcium in your bones.

06:29.740 --> 06:33.140
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.140
 Theragun is a handheld percussive device

06:35.140 --> 06:37.560
 that releases deep muscle tension.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.380
 I was first introduced to Theragun on a shark diving trip,

06:40.380 --> 06:43.900
 we were way out in the Pacific filming great white sharks

06:43.900 --> 06:46.620
 for my laboratory where we study fear.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.540
 And everyone was diving all day

06:48.540 --> 06:50.400
 carrying what are called pelican cases,

06:50.400 --> 06:52.180
 which aren't actual pelicans with wings,

06:52.180 --> 06:54.860
 but cases for these cameras, they're very heavy.

06:54.860 --> 06:57.740
 We're moving things all day, we're working really hard.

06:57.740 --> 06:58.740
 We got really sore.

06:58.740 --> 07:01.460
 I got particularly sore from all that physical labor.

07:01.460 --> 07:02.860
 Someone brought a Theragun along,

07:02.860 --> 07:05.120
 I'd never seen one of these things before or tried one.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.300
 And I spent the rest of the trip

07:06.300 --> 07:08.460
 trying to get as much time with the Theragun as I could,

07:08.460 --> 07:10.700
 at least when I was on board the boat.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.820
 With Theragun, you can get what is effectively

07:12.820 --> 07:15.700
 a deep tissue massage to any area of your body.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.360
 And you can just do that for minutes or hours

07:18.360 --> 07:20.220
 for as long as you like, it's really wonderful.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.660
 If you have someone else there who's willing to use

07:21.660 --> 07:23.940
 the Theragun on hard to reach places like your back,

07:23.940 --> 07:25.220
 that's even better.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.660
 Whether or not you want to treat muscle tension

07:26.660 --> 07:28.060
 from working out, an injury,

07:28.060 --> 07:30.580
 or just deal with daily stress from everyday life,

07:30.580 --> 07:32.500
 there's really no substitute for the Theragun.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.180
 You know, professional massage is wonderful,

07:34.180 --> 07:35.680
 but a professional massage of course

07:35.680 --> 07:37.340
 involves going to a masseuse.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.980
 It's quite expensive often, et cetera.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.620
 If you're interested in getting a Theragun,

07:41.620 --> 07:44.060
 they start at only $199.

07:44.060 --> 07:47.460

07:55.520 --> 07:58.040
 Let's talk about workspace optimization.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.460
 This is a topic that's intrigued me for a very long time

08:01.460 --> 08:05.640
 because my undergraduate advisor, my graduate advisor,

08:05.640 --> 08:09.020
 and my postdoc advisor had many things in common,

08:09.020 --> 08:10.760
 including being great scientists,

08:10.760 --> 08:12.900
 being kind people and terrific mentors,

08:12.900 --> 08:14.260
 but they had another thing in common

08:14.260 --> 08:15.800
 which always perplexed me,

08:15.800 --> 08:19.180
 which is that their offices were a complete disaster.

08:19.180 --> 08:22.520
 They had mountains of books, mountains of papers,

08:22.520 --> 08:24.220
 mountains of all sorts of stuff,

08:24.220 --> 08:27.380
 and yet all of them were extremely productive

08:27.380 --> 08:29.240
 and could remain extremely focused

08:29.240 --> 08:31.740
 in that incredibly cluttered environment.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.380
 Now I'm somebody who doesn't like clutter.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.080
 I find it very hard to focus in cluttered environments.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.040
 And indeed there's tremendous variation among people

08:39.040 --> 08:40.780
 as to whether or not they can remain focused

08:40.780 --> 08:42.180
 or whether or not they struggle to focus

08:42.180 --> 08:44.540
 in physically cluttered environments.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.220
 There's no right or wrong to this,

08:46.220 --> 08:47.580
 but the question we should ask ourselves is

08:47.580 --> 08:50.180
 why were they all able to be so focused?

08:50.180 --> 08:52.260
 And it turns out that the reason

08:52.260 --> 08:53.500
 they were able to be so focused

08:53.500 --> 08:56.560
 is that they all captured one single

08:56.560 --> 09:00.140
 and yet fundamental variable of workspace optimization.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.260
 And we'll talk about what that variable is.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.780
 In fact, we're going to talk about

09:03.780 --> 09:06.620
 what all the variables of optimizing a workspace are.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.420
 Things like vision, things like light,

09:09.420 --> 09:10.800
 things like noise in the room,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.380
 whether or not you listen to music or not,

09:12.380 --> 09:15.860
 whether or not you use noise canceling headphones or not.

09:15.860 --> 09:17.880
 We're going to talk about all of that.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.020
 And we're going to do that in a way

09:20.020 --> 09:21.660
 that you can optimize your workspace

09:21.660 --> 09:23.680
 regardless of whether or not you are at home,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.800
 whether or not you're on the road, et cetera.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.220
 Because the last thing I would ever want to do

09:28.220 --> 09:29.420
 is to create a situation

09:29.420 --> 09:31.700
 where you find the optimal workspace

09:31.700 --> 09:34.620
 and then you are a slave to that optimal workspace.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.100
 That's just not the way the world works.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.940
 What you want to do, or my goal for you rather,

09:38.940 --> 09:40.860
 is that you will have a short checklist of things

09:40.860 --> 09:43.900
 that you can look to anytime you sit down to do work.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.340
 And you can think about the underlying variables

09:46.340 --> 09:48.500
 that impact your brain and your body

09:48.500 --> 09:51.380
 and allow your brain and body to get into the optimal state

09:51.380 --> 09:54.220
 in order to learn, in order to be productive,

09:54.220 --> 09:56.260
 and the need to move through your work bouts

09:56.260 --> 09:58.340
 in a very relaxed and pleasureful way

09:58.340 --> 09:59.780
 while maintaining focus

09:59.780 --> 10:01.820
 and while pursuing any of the number of things

10:01.820 --> 10:02.740
 that you're doing.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.900
 The first variable we want to think about

10:04.900 --> 10:09.260
 in terms of workspace optimization is vision and light.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.420
 Now, on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast

10:11.420 --> 10:13.200
 devoted all to habits,

10:13.200 --> 10:16.700
 I talked about the importance of dividing your 24-hour day

10:16.700 --> 10:18.180
 into three different phases.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.380
 And for those of you that haven't heard that episode,

10:20.380 --> 10:23.420
 I'm just going to briefly summarize what I described.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.340
 From the time you wake up in the morning

10:26.340 --> 10:28.900
 until about six or seven or eight,

10:28.900 --> 10:30.300
 sometimes nine hours later,

10:30.300 --> 10:32.180
 your brain is in a unique state.

10:32.180 --> 10:35.260
 It is in a state of high levels of dopamine,

10:35.260 --> 10:38.140
 a neuromodulator, and high levels of epinephrine,

10:38.140 --> 10:40.860
 as well as hormones like cortisol and so forth.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.140
 Without going into the biology of those things,

10:43.140 --> 10:45.940
 they set your brain into a state of high alertness.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.580
 And this is true whether or not

10:47.580 --> 10:49.760
 you indulge in caffeine or not.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.600
 I know some of you say,

10:50.600 --> 10:52.480
 oh, I really don't wake up until the afternoon.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.300
 I'm much more alert and focused in the afternoon.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.420
 We will talk about that phase of the 24-hour day

10:57.420 --> 10:58.400
 in a moment.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.140
 But that early part of the day is a time of day

11:01.140 --> 11:04.080
 in which for sake of workspace optimization,

11:05.320 --> 11:07.340
 being in a brightly lit environment

11:07.340 --> 11:11.780
 can lend itself to optimal work throughout the day,

11:11.780 --> 11:13.620
 not just during that early phase.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.460
 And so while on many episodes of this podcast,

11:16.460 --> 11:17.940
 I've also emphasized the importance

11:17.940 --> 11:19.660
 of getting morning sunlight in your eyes

11:19.660 --> 11:21.520
 within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.580
 Not as often, but now and again,

11:24.580 --> 11:26.540
 I will also mention that it's important

11:26.540 --> 11:29.140
 to light your daytime environment

11:29.140 --> 11:31.500
 as brightly as you safely can.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.220
 So if you are going to be doing work in this early,

11:34.220 --> 11:36.640
 what I call phase one portion of your day,

11:36.640 --> 11:38.220
 you want to have as much light

11:38.220 --> 11:40.420
 and indeed as much overhead light

11:40.420 --> 11:42.840
 shining on you as safely possible.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.600
 Now, of course, you don't want it so bright

11:44.600 --> 11:47.200
 that it's glaring and you have to squint, et cetera,

11:47.200 --> 11:50.020
 but you want as much light as is safely possible.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.020
 And you can do that a couple of simple ways.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.260
 One is if you do own,

11:54.260 --> 11:56.620
 or you're in an environment where you have overhead lights,

11:56.620 --> 11:58.520
 turn on those overhead lights.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.780
 What's special about overhead lights for setting alertness

12:01.780 --> 12:03.820
 is that the neurons in our eyes,

12:03.820 --> 12:05.820
 which are called melanopsin ganglion cells,

12:05.820 --> 12:07.180
 that's the fancy name,

12:07.180 --> 12:10.440
 melanopsin ganglion cells are mainly enriched

12:10.440 --> 12:13.520
 in the lower half of our retinas, in our eyes,

12:13.520 --> 12:15.740
 and view the upper visual field.

12:15.740 --> 12:17.720
 Those neurons send little wires

12:17.720 --> 12:19.100
 to an area of our hypothalamus

12:19.100 --> 12:20.680
 right above the roof of our mouth

12:20.680 --> 12:23.280
 that creates a state of alertness.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.200
 Now, early in the day, we want to be as alert as possible.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.380
 And this phase one of our circadian cycle

12:28.380 --> 12:32.420
 is when we are best at doing analytic detail type work.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.740
 So we're going to go into other aspects

12:33.740 --> 12:36.860
 of workspace optimization that are important for phase one.

12:36.860 --> 12:38.980
 But during phase one, again,

12:38.980 --> 12:41.780
 within zero to about eight or nine hours after waking,

12:41.780 --> 12:43.500
 bright lights in your environment,

12:43.500 --> 12:44.620
 in particular overhead lights,

12:44.620 --> 12:46.600
 are going to facilitate focus.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.740
 They're going to facilitate further release

12:48.740 --> 12:50.980
 of things like dopamine and norepinephrine

12:50.980 --> 12:52.900
 and healthy amounts of cortisol.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.020
 And we want that to happen early in the day

12:55.020 --> 12:56.420
 for a variety of reasons.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.140
 For instance, we don't want that cortisol peak

12:58.140 --> 13:00.020
 to happen too late in the day.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.240
 That's actually associated with depression and insomnia

13:02.240 --> 13:04.340
 and a number of things that we just don't want.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.940
 So one of the things that I've done for my workspace

13:06.940 --> 13:09.060
 is to make sure that when I wake up in the morning,

13:09.060 --> 13:10.620
 I do go get my sunlight.

13:10.620 --> 13:11.620
 If the sun isn't out,

13:11.620 --> 13:13.620
 I turn on as many bright artificial lights

13:13.620 --> 13:15.260
 as I can manage or tolerate,

13:15.260 --> 13:17.340
 and then I go get my sunlight exposure.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.460
 But once I set out to do some work

13:19.460 --> 13:21.880
 that all the overhead lights in that room are on,

13:21.880 --> 13:24.100
 as well as lights in front of me.

13:24.100 --> 13:27.180
 And that's, again, to stimulate heightened levels of focus

13:27.180 --> 13:29.260
 and further release of these neuromodulators

13:29.260 --> 13:30.100
 that I mentioned before,

13:30.100 --> 13:32.920
 dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.260
 Now, the way that one could do that

13:34.260 --> 13:36.380
 could be a very low cost way of having, for instance,

13:36.380 --> 13:38.520
 a desk lamp and those overhead lights.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.500
 If you're somebody that wants to take this

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
 to the next level, you can purchase a ring light,

13:43.500 --> 13:45.180
 which is, I think those are mainly made

13:45.180 --> 13:47.940
 for people doing selfie-type videos,

13:47.940 --> 13:49.780
 for Instagram posts and things of that sort.

13:49.780 --> 13:52.820
 Ring lights can be pretty cost-effective,

13:52.820 --> 13:53.940
 and yet they're very bright,

13:53.940 --> 13:55.840
 and they have the sort of bright blue light

13:55.840 --> 13:57.960
 that is going to optimally stimulate

13:57.960 --> 13:59.900
 those melanopsin ganglion cells.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.160
 So some people I know will have a blue light

14:02.160 --> 14:04.700
 or a bright LED on their desk in front of them.

14:04.700 --> 14:05.780
 And indeed, I have one of these.

14:05.780 --> 14:06.780
 I don't use a ring light.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.480
 I use a light pad.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.400
 The particular light pad I use, I bought on Amazon.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.260
 I can mention the brand,

14:13.260 --> 14:15.320
 but again, I have no financial affiliation to them.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.340
 This is the Artograph light pad.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.200
 It's designed for drawing,

14:19.200 --> 14:22.040
 and it says on it, 930 lux.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.160
 Lux is just a measure of brightness.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.060
 So I placed that on the desk in front of me,

14:26.060 --> 14:27.620
 and I turn it on essentially

14:27.620 --> 14:29.380
 throughout this phase one of the day.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.440
 Even if I walk away from the desk, I tend to keep it on.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.940
 It doesn't consume that much energy.

14:32.940 --> 14:36.060
 And in that way, I'm constantly being bombarded with photons

14:36.060 --> 14:38.020
 that keep my levels of alertness up,

14:38.020 --> 14:39.260
 because the early part of the day

14:39.260 --> 14:41.700
 is when I do the majority of that focused work.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.200
 Again, you don't need the light pad.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.100
 You can use a ring light,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.340
 or you can simply use any kind of other lights

14:46.340 --> 14:48.520
 that you might happen to have, artificial lights.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.120
 For those of you that can place your desk near a window,

14:52.120 --> 14:53.840
 and even better to open the window,

14:53.840 --> 14:55.340
 that would be really fantastic.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.300
 I don't have access to that.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.860
 Why would I say open the window?

14:58.860 --> 15:00.140
 Well, it turns out that sunlight

15:00.140 --> 15:01.900
 is going to be the best stimulus

15:01.900 --> 15:04.020
 for waking up your brain and body

15:04.020 --> 15:06.600
 through this melanopsin to hypothalamus system.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.100
 And by looking at sunlight through a window,

15:09.100 --> 15:12.280
 it's 50, five, zero times less effective

15:12.280 --> 15:13.980
 than if that window were to be open,

15:13.980 --> 15:15.860
 mostly because those windows filter out

15:15.860 --> 15:17.560
 a lot of the wavelengths of blue light

15:17.560 --> 15:19.980
 that are essential for stimulating the eyes

15:19.980 --> 15:21.700
 and this wake-up signal.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.460
 So all of this rests on the premise

15:23.460 --> 15:26.160
 that we need to be alert in order to do our work,

15:26.160 --> 15:27.360
 in particular, focused work.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.300
 And I've talked about before in the habits episode,

15:29.300 --> 15:31.860
 and I'm saying again now, that first phase of the day,

15:31.860 --> 15:34.600
 that first seven or eight or nine hours of the day

15:34.600 --> 15:37.580
 is really the time in which our neurochemistry

15:37.580 --> 15:41.560
 is primed for getting the most amount of focused,

15:41.560 --> 15:43.100
 kind of challenging work done

15:43.100 --> 15:45.340
 where a lot of precision and detail is required.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.820
 So you want to brightly light your work environment

15:47.820 --> 15:49.500
 during that first phase.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.400
 Again, from the time you wake up, try and get sunlight,

15:52.400 --> 15:54.900
 but then even if you're going to get exercise

15:54.900 --> 15:55.740
 or do other things,

15:55.740 --> 15:57.100
 you want to get as much bright light in your eyes

15:57.100 --> 15:58.260
 as you safely can,

15:58.260 --> 16:00.920
 and then you want to light your work environment.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.580
 Now in the afternoon, starting at about nine

16:03.580 --> 16:07.240
 and continuing until about 16 hours after waking,

16:07.240 --> 16:10.240
 you want to start dimming the lights in that environment.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.780
 Now you don't want to make it dark

16:11.780 --> 16:12.900
 because you don't want to get sleepy

16:12.900 --> 16:14.140
 at two o'clock in the afternoon

16:14.140 --> 16:15.460
 unless you're going to take a brief nap,

16:15.460 --> 16:16.960
 which I do and is perfectly fine

16:16.960 --> 16:20.660
 as long as it doesn't interfere with your nighttime sleep.

16:20.660 --> 16:23.860
 But the idea is that in this so-called phase two

16:23.860 --> 16:25.500
 of the 24 hour cycle,

16:25.500 --> 16:28.960
 from about nine to 16 hours after waking,

16:29.900 --> 16:32.860
 you want to bring the level of lights down a bit.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.900
 And when I say down, I literally mean down.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.660
 Having lights that are in front of you is fine,

16:37.660 --> 16:40.840
 but overhead lights at that time are not going to be optimal

16:40.840 --> 16:43.720
 for the sorts of neurochemical states

16:43.720 --> 16:45.120
 that your brain wants to be in.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.740
 The states that I'm referring to are a shift

16:47.740 --> 16:49.460
 from the dopamine and norepinephrine

16:49.460 --> 16:51.220
 that's highest early in the day

16:51.220 --> 16:53.580
 to increases in things like serotonin

16:53.580 --> 16:56.140
 and other neuromodulators that put your brain

16:56.140 --> 16:59.000
 into a state that's better for creative endeavors

16:59.000 --> 17:00.900
 or for more abstract thinking.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.740
 Now, as we'll soon see,

17:02.740 --> 17:04.040
 there are other things you can do

17:04.040 --> 17:06.620
 to improve creative thinking and abstract thinking.

17:06.620 --> 17:07.660
 And in fact, there are things you can do

17:07.660 --> 17:08.940
 to improve analytic thinking.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.100
 We will talk about those,

17:10.100 --> 17:11.460
 things that are distinct from light,

17:11.460 --> 17:13.260
 but right now we're just focusing on light.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.980
 So what I recommend doing and what I personally do

17:15.980 --> 17:18.780
 is I will turn off overhead lights in the afternoon.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.200
 It's not completely dim, it's not completely dark,

17:21.200 --> 17:24.040
 but I will start to reduce the amount of overhead light

17:24.040 --> 17:25.780
 and just simply keep the light pad on

17:25.780 --> 17:28.420
 and whatever other lamps I happen to be using.

17:28.420 --> 17:31.340
 Now, one thing we haven't talked about is screen brightness.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.940
 This is highly individual.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.280
 People have different retinal sensitivities.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.660
 What I mean by that is everybody differs

17:37.660 --> 17:40.200
 in terms of how bright they can tolerate

17:40.200 --> 17:42.480
 their visual environment and their screen.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.160
 And whether or not you are sensitive to light or not

17:45.160 --> 17:46.420
 will depend on a lot of factors.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.500
 Some of it is eye color.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.540
 Indeed, people with darker color eyes

17:49.540 --> 17:52.940
 generally can tolerate more bright light than others.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.260
 I have green eyes.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.480
 I am very, very sensitive to light.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.340
 If I'm outdoors at a cafe or something

17:58.340 --> 18:00.380
 and the table has any kind of reflective properties

18:00.380 --> 18:01.780
 and it's a sunny day,

18:01.780 --> 18:04.380
 I can barely see the person across the table from me

18:04.380 --> 18:06.300
 unless I'm wearing sunglasses.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.080
 Some people, other members of my family, for instance,

18:09.080 --> 18:11.100
 have dark brown eyes and can just sit there

18:11.100 --> 18:12.900
 and have a conversation without the need

18:12.900 --> 18:14.580
 for sunglasses at all.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.340
 So there's tremendous variation there.

18:16.340 --> 18:20.420
 One or the other isn't healthy or advantageous necessarily.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.740
 Just understand that you never want to be in an environment

18:22.740 --> 18:26.240
 where it's painful to maintain looking at whatever it is

18:26.240 --> 18:27.080
 that you're looking at.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.160
 If something's painful to look at,

18:28.160 --> 18:29.420
 it could be damaging to your eyes.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.420
 So you do want to protect your eyes.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.320
 Now, in this second phase of the day,

18:34.320 --> 18:35.900
 since most of us are working indoors,

18:35.900 --> 18:37.740
 but even if you're working outdoors,

18:37.740 --> 18:40.380
 you want to try and get the amount of light

18:40.380 --> 18:43.340
 reduced overall, but in particular that overhead light.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.260
 And you also want to start reducing the amount of blue light

18:46.260 --> 18:47.620
 that you're being exposed to.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.660
 So somewhere around four or 5 p.m.,

18:49.660 --> 18:53.620
 which for me is about 12 hours after I've been awake

18:53.620 --> 18:55.500
 or 14 hours after I've been awake,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.440
 I will turn off that light pad

18:57.440 --> 19:00.020
 and start to transition the lights in my environment

19:00.020 --> 19:02.060
 to more yellows and reds.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.220
 Now, I can't always do this.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.060
 I have friends that actually have converted

19:05.060 --> 19:07.980
 their entire homes from blue light early in the day

19:07.980 --> 19:09.180
 to red light late in the day.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.740
 That's really cool and fantastic.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.100
 I haven't done that.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.780
 It's, you know, there's a cost to doing that,

19:13.780 --> 19:17.140
 and it is optimal in terms of optimizing productivity

19:17.140 --> 19:18.060
 and sleep and so forth,

19:18.060 --> 19:20.380
 but it's not feasible for a lot of people.

19:20.380 --> 19:24.060
 But what I do is I simply switch to using yellow lamps.

19:24.060 --> 19:26.440
 I will turn off that LED in the later afternoon,

19:26.440 --> 19:28.180
 again, around four or 5 p.m.,

19:28.180 --> 19:30.880
 and I tend to wake up around 6 a.m. or so.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.900
 I'll turn those off.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.180
 And what I'll try and do also

19:33.180 --> 19:35.580
 is I'll try and dim the screen that I'm working on

19:35.580 --> 19:37.300
 so that I can still manage to see everything

19:37.300 --> 19:40.020
 that I need to see, but it's quite a bit dimmer

19:40.020 --> 19:41.460
 than it was early in the day.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.980
 So that's phase two of the day,

19:42.980 --> 19:45.020
 and that's how we want to think about light.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.500
 And then I'll just mention,

19:46.500 --> 19:47.980
 because I know there are people

19:47.980 --> 19:49.660
 who are working in the middle of the night,

19:49.660 --> 19:50.500
 there's phase three,

19:50.500 --> 19:53.820
 which is about 17 to 24 hours after waking.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.540
 And I realized that for shift workers

19:55.540 --> 19:57.620
 or for people that are pulling all-nighters

19:57.620 --> 20:00.100
 or for students, oftentimes you need to be awake

20:00.100 --> 20:01.100
 and studying in the middle of the night.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.060
 I myself am somebody who for years would pull

20:04.060 --> 20:06.980
 anywhere from five to 10 all-nighters per year.

20:06.980 --> 20:08.820
 I still pull an all-nighter now and again

20:08.820 --> 20:10.340
 because of deadlines and so forth.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.220
 I don't recommend it.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.280
 If you can avoid it, great,

20:12.280 --> 20:13.820
 but many people just simply have to do this

20:13.820 --> 20:16.700
 for sake of shift work or because of impending deadlines

20:16.700 --> 20:19.140
 or procrastination or all of the above.

20:19.140 --> 20:21.220
 If you are going to be doing work

20:21.220 --> 20:24.020
 in that third phase of your circadian cycle,

20:24.020 --> 20:26.900
 you really want to limit the amount of bright light

20:26.900 --> 20:28.500
 that you're getting in your eyes

20:28.500 --> 20:30.140
 to just the amount that allows you

20:30.140 --> 20:31.900
 to do the work that you're doing.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.600
 Because if you get light in your eyes

20:33.600 --> 20:35.260
 that's any brighter than that,

20:35.260 --> 20:37.980
 you're going to severely deplete your melatonin levels.

20:37.980 --> 20:40.580
 You're going to severely shift your circadian clock

20:40.580 --> 20:43.380
 and it's effectively like traveling to another time zone.

20:43.380 --> 20:46.540
 So if you stay up from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m.

20:46.540 --> 20:49.720
 or 2 a.m. until 4 a.m. working on a term paper

20:49.720 --> 20:50.660
 or something of that sort

20:50.660 --> 20:52.580
 and you're getting bright light in your eyes,

20:52.580 --> 20:55.440
 you are effectively flying six hours

20:55.440 --> 20:56.580
 to a different time zone

20:56.580 --> 20:58.540
 or at least that's what your body registers it as.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.680
 And it can really throw your sleep and your metabolism

21:00.680 --> 21:03.100
 and a number of other things out of whack.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.220
 Now there's an exception to this,

21:04.220 --> 21:06.140
 which is if you really want to be awake,

21:06.140 --> 21:07.500
 it can often be beneficial

21:07.500 --> 21:09.100
 to flipping on all the lights in the room

21:09.100 --> 21:10.480
 and keeping them really bright.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.660
 One of the hardest things to do

21:11.660 --> 21:13.600
 is to stay up all night studying

21:13.600 --> 21:15.640
 when you're in a dim environment.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.580
 So you have to determine the trade-off

21:17.580 --> 21:20.020
 between whether or not you want to shift your clock

21:20.020 --> 21:21.840
 or whether or not you want to get the work done.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.260
 And I would say the ideal situation is to sleep at night

21:25.260 --> 21:27.880
 and to do your work during the day and in the afternoon.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.540
 But if you do have to be awake in the middle of the night,

21:30.540 --> 21:32.740
 do understand that you want to dim those lights overall.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.460
 You would not want to use that LED.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.140
 You would not want to have overhead lights on

21:36.140 --> 21:38.320
 unless you're really struggling to stay awake,

21:38.320 --> 21:39.220
 in which case you want to get

21:39.220 --> 21:40.940
 as many bright lights on as possible.

21:40.940 --> 21:42.700
 So there are a couple of tricks to all-nighters.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.300
 I don't really want people pulling all-nighters

21:44.300 --> 21:45.520
 unless they have to,

21:45.520 --> 21:47.580
 but there are a few things that you can do

21:47.580 --> 21:50.420
 without taking stimulants in order to stay up all night

21:50.420 --> 21:53.560
 that can be beneficial that maximize on your biology.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.780
 One of them that's a little less commonly known

21:56.780 --> 21:59.460
 is you can drink 32 ounces of water

21:59.460 --> 22:02.720
 and commit to not going to the bathroom for 90 minutes

22:02.720 --> 22:03.560
 at least.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.860
 It turns out that there's a circuit

22:04.860 --> 22:06.260
 that goes from your bladder,

22:06.260 --> 22:08.000
 literally neurons that go from your bladder

22:08.000 --> 22:09.260
 to your brainstem.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.660
 And when you have to urinate, it makes you very alert,

22:11.660 --> 22:13.140
 as many of you have probably experienced.

22:13.140 --> 22:14.140
 This is actually what wakes us up

22:14.140 --> 22:15.180
 in the middle of the night

22:15.180 --> 22:16.380
 when we have to use the bathroom

22:16.380 --> 22:19.060
 is this circuit for alertness that goes from full bladder.

22:19.060 --> 22:21.780
 It's signaled by the bladder being full to the brainstem.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.800
 And this is the circuit that is disrupted

22:23.800 --> 22:25.680
 in kids that have bedwetting issues.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.580
 And there are a number of cognitive behavioral approaches

22:27.580 --> 22:28.400
 to that.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.140
 Sometimes bedwetting in very young kids

22:30.140 --> 22:32.300
 is because the circuit hasn't developed yet.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.080
 Most adults, fortunately, are not bedwetting,

22:34.080 --> 22:37.940
 but you can increase the amount of alertness in your system

22:37.940 --> 22:39.360
 and remain awake in the middle of the night

22:39.360 --> 22:43.020
 by drinking a little bit more water than you normally would

22:43.020 --> 22:44.780
 and then refraining from going to the restroom.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.480
 That certainly will lend itself to alertness.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.580
 You know how difficult it is to fall asleep

22:48.580 --> 22:50.780
 when you have to use the restroom, for instance.

22:50.780 --> 22:51.640
 So that's one tool.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.500
 The other thing is, again,

22:52.500 --> 22:53.820
 to flip on as many bright lights

22:53.820 --> 22:55.620
 in the environment as possible.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.180
 And then, of course, people will rely on stimulants

22:58.180 --> 23:00.660
 like caffeine or even more aggressive stimulants.

23:00.660 --> 23:03.100
 That's not something I necessarily recommend.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.820
 You'll each have to determine that for you.

23:04.820 --> 23:07.340
 But if you do, in fact, have to use all nighters

23:07.340 --> 23:09.780
 for any reason, you can maximize this bladder

23:09.780 --> 23:12.380
 to brain approach and the bright light approach.

23:12.380 --> 23:14.560
 Okay, so that more or less covers how bright

23:14.560 --> 23:16.340
 to keep your overall environment

23:16.340 --> 23:17.740
 and how bright to keep your screen.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.500
 If you really want to get nerdy about this,

23:19.500 --> 23:21.580
 there is a free app called Light Meter

23:21.580 --> 23:24.100
 where you can start measuring how many lux,

23:24.100 --> 23:26.620
 how many photons are in a given environment.

23:26.620 --> 23:29.380
 It's actually measuring reflectance of photons and so on.

23:29.380 --> 23:32.740
 Maybe you can look up what a lux meter does if you like.

23:32.740 --> 23:34.340
 I don't necessarily recommend doing that.

23:34.340 --> 23:37.820
 I don't want to set a critical threshold by which,

23:37.820 --> 23:39.580
 for instance, we say once your environment

23:39.580 --> 23:41.980
 is more than 1500 lux, then it's too bright

23:41.980 --> 23:43.700
 or not bright enough, et cetera.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.600
 Everyone has different retinal sensitivities.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.740
 Everyone will find that different levels of brightness

23:47.740 --> 23:49.260
 will cause them to be alert.

23:49.260 --> 23:52.540
 Different levels of dimness, if you will, in the room

23:52.540 --> 23:54.200
 will cause them to feel sleepy.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.020
 You really want to just modulate across the 24 hour cycle

23:57.020 --> 23:58.580
 where it's very bright.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.380
 As bright as it safely can be early in the day

24:00.380 --> 24:01.380
 so that you are alert,

24:01.380 --> 24:04.060
 you can do your focus detailed work in that first phase.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.620
 And then in the afternoon,

24:05.620 --> 24:07.860
 as you move into more creative type works

24:07.860 --> 24:10.380
 or abstract thinking or working with other people

24:10.380 --> 24:12.340
 in kind of a brainstorming mode

24:12.340 --> 24:14.820
 that you would shift to dimmer lights, yellow lights,

24:14.820 --> 24:17.020
 eliminate the blue lights as much as possible.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.740
 Now that's light, but there's another aspect of vision

24:19.740 --> 24:21.960
 that has been shown to be critically important

24:21.960 --> 24:24.400
 for how alert we are going to be

24:24.400 --> 24:27.360
 and how well we can maintain that alertness.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.740
 And that has to do with where our visual focus is

24:30.740 --> 24:32.160
 in a given environment.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.660
 So I'm not talking about overall brightness.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.580
 What I'm referring to now is simply

24:35.580 --> 24:37.700
 where you place your phone or your tablet

24:37.700 --> 24:39.460
 or computer screen or book,

24:39.460 --> 24:41.520
 whatever it is that you happen to be looking at.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.380
 There's a very underappreciated

24:43.380 --> 24:46.340
 and yet incredible aspect of our neurology

24:46.340 --> 24:48.580
 that has to do with the relationship

24:48.580 --> 24:52.180
 between where we look and our level of alertness.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.860
 And it works in a very logical way.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.940
 We have clusters of neurons in our brainstem

24:56.940 --> 25:00.940
 and those clusters of neurons control our eyelid muscles

25:00.940 --> 25:03.420
 and they control our eye movements up and down

25:03.420 --> 25:04.260
 and to the sides.

25:04.260 --> 25:06.380
 And indeed, if you were to look at an eyeball,

25:06.380 --> 25:08.440
 I've looked at a lot of eyeballs in my lab

25:08.440 --> 25:11.460
 and I teach neuroanatomy, so we do this from time to time,

25:11.460 --> 25:14.140
 we would see that there are six muscles

25:14.140 --> 25:15.960
 attached to your eyeball.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.800
 Now, four of them are located at the top, the bottom,

25:19.800 --> 25:21.380
 and the two sides of your eyeball,

25:21.380 --> 25:24.700
 sort of at the 12 o'clock, six o'clock, three o'clock,

25:24.700 --> 25:26.580
 and nine o'clock of your eyeball.

25:26.580 --> 25:29.460
 And those muscles can move your eye in the socket

25:29.460 --> 25:31.140
 from side to side and up and down.

25:31.140 --> 25:32.940
 And then we also have some muscles

25:32.940 --> 25:35.580
 that can actually pull the eyeballs at angles, okay?

25:35.580 --> 25:38.620
 So we have different muscles that can move the eyes

25:38.620 --> 25:39.740
 at different angles as well.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.140
 And that's why we can look up into the side

25:41.140 --> 25:41.980
 or down into the side,

25:41.980 --> 25:44.180
 not just from side to side or up or down.

25:44.180 --> 25:46.500
 Now, the neurons that control those muscles

25:46.500 --> 25:48.660
 have a very interesting feature,

25:48.660 --> 25:53.500
 which is that when we are looking down toward the ground

25:53.500 --> 25:58.300
 or anywhere below basically the central region of our face,

25:59.140 --> 26:02.140
 the neurons that control that eye movement

26:02.140 --> 26:04.740
 are intimately related to areas of the brainstem

26:04.740 --> 26:06.980
 that release certain types of neuromodulators

26:06.980 --> 26:08.620
 and neurotransmitters.

26:08.620 --> 26:10.660
 And they activate areas of the brain

26:10.660 --> 26:12.420
 that are associated with calm

26:12.420 --> 26:14.780
 and indeed even with sleepiness.

26:14.780 --> 26:17.700
 And there's an active inhibition

26:17.700 --> 26:22.660
 or prevention of neurons that increase alertness.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.360
 Now, the opposite is also true.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.920
 We have neurons that place our eyes into an upward gaze

26:27.920 --> 26:30.140
 above the sort of level of our nose

26:30.140 --> 26:31.940
 and up above our forehead,

26:31.940 --> 26:35.360
 literally looking up while keeping the head stationary.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.140
 Or if you tilt your head back and you look up,

26:37.140 --> 26:38.980
 these neurons are still active.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.820
 Those neurons don't just control the position of the eyes

26:41.820 --> 26:43.380
 and cause them to move up.

26:43.380 --> 26:46.160
 They also trigger the activation of brain circuits

26:46.160 --> 26:48.540
 that are associated with alertness.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.160
 Now, this is a fundamental feature

26:51.160 --> 26:54.500
 of the way that our eyes and brain are wired together

26:54.500 --> 26:57.300
 and how they relate to what we call autonomic arousal.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.380
 And there are a bunch of details there.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.620
 We will actually have a guest in a few weeks

27:00.620 --> 27:03.420
 who has learned to exploit these neurons

27:03.420 --> 27:05.500
 and the fact that they control these different states

27:05.500 --> 27:09.640
 of calm or alertness in order to generate hypnotic states,

27:09.640 --> 27:11.900
 to place people into very atypical states

27:11.900 --> 27:14.900
 in which they are both very alert and very calm.

27:15.820 --> 27:17.640
 Save that for a future episode.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.820
 But the important thing to understand

27:19.820 --> 27:23.140
 is when you are looking down below the level of your nose,

27:23.140 --> 27:26.100
 you are essentially decelerating your alertness.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.960
 You're reducing your amount of alertness.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.180
 It might be subtle, but it's happening.

27:30.180 --> 27:31.660
 Whereas when you look straight ahead

27:31.660 --> 27:33.860
 or in particular when you look up,

27:33.860 --> 27:36.180
 you're increasing your level of alertness.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.240
 Now, this has some obvious implications.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.420
 When we get sleepy, our eyelids tend to close

27:40.420 --> 27:42.020
 and we tend to nod down.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.860
 When we're wide awake, we tend to be wide-eyed.

27:44.860 --> 27:46.500
 We don't tend to blink as often.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.300
 And we tend to be chin up

27:48.300 --> 27:50.300
 and kind of on vigilance and alertness.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.380
 So this has a evolutionary

27:52.380 --> 27:54.940
 or at least an adaptive component to it.

27:56.380 --> 27:59.300
 This can be exploited and indeed it's been researched

27:59.300 --> 28:01.100
 in terms of how it can be used

28:01.100 --> 28:03.400
 to optimize work environments.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.360
 Contrary to what most people do,

28:06.360 --> 28:10.180
 which is to look down at their laptop, tablet, or phone,

28:10.180 --> 28:11.420
 if you want to be alert

28:11.420 --> 28:14.200
 and you want to maintain the maximum amount of focus

28:14.200 --> 28:16.460
 for whatever it is that you're reading or doing,

28:16.460 --> 28:19.020
 you want that screen or whatever it is

28:19.020 --> 28:21.260
 that you're looking at to at least be at eye level

28:21.260 --> 28:23.900
 and ideally slightly above it.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.660
 Now, I haven't seen many workspaces

28:26.660 --> 28:28.380
 that take advantage of this

28:28.380 --> 28:30.680
 very hardwired neurobiological fact.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.240
 So what should you do with this information?

28:32.240 --> 28:34.500
 Well, if you're somebody who sits down to do work

28:34.500 --> 28:37.660
 and starts to feel sleepy or simply unfocused,

28:37.660 --> 28:40.960
 unable to attend to whatever it is that you're doing,

28:40.960 --> 28:44.340
 I highly recommend that you take your laptop or tablet.

28:44.340 --> 28:46.940
 I do hope that most people aren't doing serious work

28:46.940 --> 28:49.120
 on their phones because it's such a small visual window

28:49.120 --> 28:51.240
 and we can talk about why that's an issue later.

28:51.240 --> 28:54.820
 And the idea would be to place that screen of your tablet

28:54.820 --> 28:57.740
 or your laptop or other computer

28:57.740 --> 29:00.800
 and try and get it elevated at least to nose level,

29:00.800 --> 29:03.020
 your nose level, or even higher.

29:03.020 --> 29:05.040
 I realize that can be complicated to do.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.780
 I've long just used a stack of books

29:07.780 --> 29:09.900
 or I'll sometimes take a box and turn it upside down

29:09.900 --> 29:10.820
 and set it there.

29:10.820 --> 29:12.800
 I do use a mixed standing seated desk.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.960
 I'll talk about that in a few minutes.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.280
 There are a number of different ways that you could do this.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.780
 You could wall mount a monitor.

29:18.780 --> 29:20.520
 I think many people are working with laptops.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.380
 It's a little bit harder to do that with a laptop.

29:23.380 --> 29:25.720
 Some people though will configure a second screen.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.180
 You have to decide what's right for you and your budget.

29:28.180 --> 29:30.980
 But again, in addition to having a brightly lit room

29:30.980 --> 29:33.020
 to be able to focus and attend

29:33.020 --> 29:34.380
 to whatever it is you're working on,

29:34.380 --> 29:36.060
 you want to have that screen position

29:36.060 --> 29:37.660
 high in your visual environment.

29:37.660 --> 29:39.780
 Now you wouldn't want it on the ceiling necessarily.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.340
 Oh, that would be pretty cool.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.220
 But you do want it above you.

29:44.220 --> 29:46.160
 Now there are a couple of solutions to this

29:46.160 --> 29:49.980
 that don't involve a wall mount or stacking books or boxes.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.060
 For instance, you could be one of those people

29:52.060 --> 29:54.140
 that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa

29:54.140 --> 29:55.840
 and get your screen up above you

29:55.840 --> 29:57.580
 by putting pillows on your knees.

29:57.580 --> 30:00.420
 I used to actually do a lot of my writing and work

30:00.420 --> 30:01.260
 in the middle of the night.

30:01.260 --> 30:02.940
 I don't do this anymore and I don't recommend it,

30:02.940 --> 30:04.620
 but I used to do a lot of work from bed.

30:04.620 --> 30:08.760
 Now I no longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.440
 I just really try and keep the bedroom for sleeping

30:11.440 --> 30:12.500
 or whatever else.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.340
 But in terms of lying down on the couch,

30:15.340 --> 30:18.140
 it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you.

30:18.140 --> 30:20.900
 You can kind of slide underneath that screen and get typing.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.180
 But there's a problem with that.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.420
 And we'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment,

30:24.420 --> 30:26.740
 but it turns out that your posture,

30:26.740 --> 30:29.760
 literally the position of your body relative to gravity

30:29.760 --> 30:32.640
 also has important implications for how alert you are.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.660
 So ideally you would be standing or seated.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.420
 I would say the ideal would be standing,

30:37.420 --> 30:39.220
 second best would be seated.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.820
 And your screen will be either directly in front of you

30:41.820 --> 30:43.100
 or slightly above you.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.660
 Or if you wanted to get really fancy,

30:44.660 --> 30:47.180
 you could create a situation where it was above you

30:47.180 --> 30:48.700
 and slightly tilted toward you

30:48.700 --> 30:50.340
 so that you actually had to maintain

30:50.340 --> 30:51.920
 kind of proper neck posture.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.380
 This accomplishes a number of things.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.980
 In addition to making you more alert,

30:54.980 --> 30:57.300
 you also get away from the so-called text neck.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.860
 People are starting to look more like Cs nowadays,

30:59.860 --> 31:01.840
 the shape of the letter C,

31:01.840 --> 31:03.780
 because we're constantly looking down.

31:03.780 --> 31:05.860
 I do every once in a while see somebody

31:05.860 --> 31:08.260
 who's texting in public with it at eye level.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.020
 It always looks a little odd that they're doing that,

31:10.020 --> 31:12.140
 but I always admire their posture at the same time.

31:12.140 --> 31:14.220
 So we shouldn't give them a hard time.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.980
 So this is another feature that you can arrange

31:16.980 --> 31:18.740
 into your physical workspace.

31:18.740 --> 31:19.880
 Again, whether or not you're seated

31:19.880 --> 31:22.320
 or you're standing throughout the day,

31:22.320 --> 31:24.300
 try and get that screen elevated.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.260
 Now with reference to posture,

31:26.260 --> 31:28.060
 there are beautiful data illustrating

31:28.060 --> 31:30.560
 that when we are standing up,

31:30.560 --> 31:32.420
 those same neurons in our brainstem,

31:32.420 --> 31:34.820
 locus coeruleus neurons, which release,

31:34.820 --> 31:37.780
 I should mention things like norepinephrine and epinephrine,

31:37.780 --> 31:40.500
 those neurons become active when we are standing.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.320
 They become even more active when we are ambulatory,

31:43.320 --> 31:44.160
 when we are moving.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.540
 And we will talk about treadmilling and cycling at your desk

31:46.540 --> 31:48.200
 and so forth in a little bit.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.180
 But when you sit, they become a little less active.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.700
 And when you lie down,

31:52.700 --> 31:55.380
 and indeed anytime that you start to get your feet

31:55.380 --> 31:59.180
 up above your waist or your head tilted back,

31:59.180 --> 32:01.860
 those neurons fire less and neurons in your brain

32:01.860 --> 32:03.500
 that are involved in calming

32:03.500 --> 32:05.560
 and indeed putting you to sleep start increasing

32:05.560 --> 32:06.980
 their level of firing.

32:06.980 --> 32:08.580
 It's a really beautiful system.

32:08.580 --> 32:09.780
 So beautiful in fact,

32:09.780 --> 32:10.740
 that there are studies that show

32:10.740 --> 32:14.540
 that as you adjust the angle of the body back,

32:14.540 --> 32:17.500
 you actually get a sort of dose dependent increase

32:17.500 --> 32:19.420
 in sleepiness and calmness

32:19.420 --> 32:22.860
 and a dose dependent decrease in alertness.

32:22.860 --> 32:26.100
 And so as we were all told to sit up straight

32:26.100 --> 32:28.080
 or even better to stand up straight.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.100
 And now I'm also telling you to get that visual thing

32:31.100 --> 32:32.760
 that you're attending to screen or otherwise

32:32.760 --> 32:35.760
 up in front of you or ideally above you.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.660
 Those things combine to generate maximum alertness.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.100
 So you can think about how you might work this

32:40.100 --> 32:43.300
 into various aspects of your homework environment

32:43.300 --> 32:44.980
 or office work environment.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.340
 But as I described this,

32:46.340 --> 32:48.020
 many of you are probably thinking what I'm thinking,

32:48.020 --> 32:49.960
 which is gosh, most of what we do

32:49.960 --> 32:52.300
 is in complete opposite direction

32:52.300 --> 32:55.280
 to all of this neurobiologically grounded advice.

32:55.280 --> 32:58.140
 Most of us are looking down at our laptop while seated,

32:58.140 --> 32:59.380
 or we are lying down,

32:59.380 --> 33:01.100
 which is going to make us more sleepy,

33:01.100 --> 33:04.220
 or we are positioning our computers in front of us,

33:04.220 --> 33:07.060
 but we really aren't in an environment that's bright enough

33:07.060 --> 33:08.420
 and so on and so forth.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.340
 So as you can tell,

33:09.340 --> 33:11.060
 we're starting to layer in the various things

33:11.060 --> 33:11.900
 that you can do.

33:11.900 --> 33:12.980
 First, brightness in the room.

33:12.980 --> 33:14.620
 Second, get that screen up

33:14.620 --> 33:18.020
 and try and put yourself into a posture for work

33:18.020 --> 33:21.780
 that lends itself or promotes alertness.

33:21.780 --> 33:23.300
 If indeed you want to be alert for that work.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.660
 If your goal is to take a nap,

33:24.660 --> 33:26.820
 get your feet elevated about 10 to 15 degrees

33:26.820 --> 33:27.660
 above your head,

33:27.660 --> 33:29.700
 maybe put a pillow underneath it, lie down and take a nap.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.920
 But that's not what we're talking about today.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.860
 We're talking about workspace optimization.

33:32.860 --> 33:36.600
 And I suppose you could also exploit that all-nighter trick

33:36.600 --> 33:37.980
 that I talked about earlier.

33:37.980 --> 33:40.260
 I actually did this when I was an undergraduate.

33:40.260 --> 33:42.460
 I was a little bit masochistic in this way.

33:42.460 --> 33:46.980
 I would drink coffee and water at fairly high volume.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.980
 I wasn't forced drinking or anything like that,

33:49.980 --> 33:52.060
 but I actually wouldn't allow myself to get up

33:52.060 --> 33:53.800
 and use the bathroom except on a timer.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.360
 So I think the longest I ever went was three and a half

33:56.360 --> 33:57.200
 hours.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.460
 It was kind of excruciating.

33:58.460 --> 34:01.140
 I actually don't think that's necessarily a healthy advice,

34:01.140 --> 34:04.060
 but again, you can use slight, I mentioned,

34:04.060 --> 34:05.900
 slight over-consumption of fluids

34:05.900 --> 34:07.560
 in order to generate alertness.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.580
 That was just me really trying to get as much work done

34:09.580 --> 34:10.420
 as I could.

34:10.420 --> 34:13.040
 I had a very, very demanding class schedule,

34:13.040 --> 34:15.260
 and it was just the only way that I could get work done.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.080
 If I was getting up every few minutes to use the restroom,

34:17.080 --> 34:19.260
 I found it hard to re-engage in that work

34:19.260 --> 34:20.480
 and maintain focus,

34:20.480 --> 34:22.380
 which is what I just want to briefly mention now.

34:22.380 --> 34:24.940
 I talked about this in the episode on focus,

34:24.940 --> 34:27.040
 but one thing that is completely unreasonable

34:27.040 --> 34:29.000
 and that you should never ask yourself to do

34:29.000 --> 34:31.400
 is to sit down or stand up

34:31.400 --> 34:33.140
 and immediately focus on something,

34:33.140 --> 34:35.720
 unless you're stressed about what you're looking at,

34:35.720 --> 34:37.280
 or you're very, very excited by it.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.560
 If you're very stressed about some sort of information

34:39.560 --> 34:40.540
 or a deadline,

34:40.540 --> 34:42.480
 or you're very, very excited about something,

34:42.480 --> 34:44.400
 you'll find that you can focus instantly

34:44.400 --> 34:45.560
 just within a moment.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.680
 And that's because of the deployment of neurochemicals

34:47.680 --> 34:48.920
 like dopamine and norepinephrine

34:48.920 --> 34:50.720
 that bring about our levels of alertness.

34:50.720 --> 34:53.320
 However, most of us, including myself,

34:53.320 --> 34:56.080
 will go to begin a workout and we'll find that our mind

34:56.080 --> 34:58.940
 doesn't quite engage at the level of depth and focus

34:58.940 --> 35:01.000
 that we would like right off the bat.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.620
 I've timed this and other studies have timed this

35:03.620 --> 35:04.960
 in a more rigorous way.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.000
 Mine is just what we call anic data.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.040
 So I've timed it for myself,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.680
 but there are studies that have looked at this.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.160
 And the data point to the fact that

35:12.160 --> 35:15.200
 even at our most heightened levels of focus,

35:15.200 --> 35:18.240
 most people can only maintain focus before switching tasks

35:18.240 --> 35:19.900
 for about three minutes,

35:19.900 --> 35:23.120
 which is depressingly short period of time.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.940
 However, you can extend that period of time,

35:24.940 --> 35:27.100
 and I've talked about that in the episode on focus,

35:27.100 --> 35:27.960
 but more importantly,

35:27.960 --> 35:30.920
 when you sit down to start a workout of any kind,

35:30.920 --> 35:35.060
 any kind, expect that it would take about six minutes

35:35.060 --> 35:37.440
 for you to engage these neural circuits.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.080
 You wouldn't expect yourself to walk into the gym

35:39.080 --> 35:42.900
 and do a PR lift or start running and do your best sprint

35:42.900 --> 35:45.680
 or just head out the door without warming up at all.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.680
 You know, a little walk jog at first,

35:47.680 --> 35:49.640
 or, you know, a few warmup sets.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.200
 I mean, that's, we expect that.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.480
 We are not surprised that we need that.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.240
 And yet we sort of expect that our brain should be able

35:55.240 --> 35:58.200
 to lock on and do work in a very focused way immediately.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.520
 And that's just a ridiculous assumption.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.620
 It's an unfair assumption, I should say.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.560
 So assume that it will take about six minutes

36:04.560 --> 36:07.760
 to engage in your workout and that those neurochemical

36:07.760 --> 36:10.720
 systems will take some time to rev up and engage.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.480
 The other things that I'm describing about lighting

36:12.480 --> 36:13.800
 and screen positioning and posture,

36:13.800 --> 36:16.820
 those will also help maximize your focus

36:16.820 --> 36:19.920
 and will limit that ramp up time into a focused state.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.600
 And I think what you'll find is that

36:21.600 --> 36:23.560
 as you maximize your workspace,

36:23.560 --> 36:25.360
 the time, the latency, as we say,

36:25.360 --> 36:28.520
 to get into that focus will start to shorten.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.640
 It'll especially start to shorten if you use tools

36:30.640 --> 36:33.580
 to limit distraction, we will talk about distraction,

36:33.580 --> 36:36.040
 but things like Freedom, which is an app,

36:36.040 --> 36:38.000
 a free app that allows you to lock yourself

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
 out of the internet or turning off your phone, for instance.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.760
 But even if you're doing work on your phone

36:42.760 --> 36:44.700
 or that involves your phone or the internet,

36:44.700 --> 36:47.080
 as many of us, including myself do,

36:47.080 --> 36:50.720
 expect there to be a ramp up time for you to focus.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.100
 There's another aspect of our vision

36:52.100 --> 36:54.800
 that's absolutely critical for optimizing our workspace.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.620
 And that has to do with this really interesting feature

36:57.620 --> 37:01.520
 of our visual pathways in that it has two major channels.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.040
 Those two major channels have names,

37:03.040 --> 37:04.400
 although you don't have to remember the names.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.600
 The first one is the so-called parvocellular channel,

37:07.600 --> 37:10.680
 which is involved in looking at things at specific points

37:10.680 --> 37:13.920
 in space and at high resolution or detail.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.880
 And then there's the so-called magnocellular channel

37:16.880 --> 37:20.920
 that's involved in looking at big swaths of visual space

37:20.920 --> 37:22.360
 and at lower resolution.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.460
 So you can think of the parvocellular system

37:24.460 --> 37:26.840
 as kind of a high pixel density.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.080
 Think about your most modern smartphone,

37:29.080 --> 37:31.480
 the recent smartphone with the best, best camera,

37:31.480 --> 37:33.440
 and think about the magnocellular system

37:33.440 --> 37:36.500
 as being lower resolution, kind of an older smartphone,

37:36.500 --> 37:38.040
 lower pixels, et cetera.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.600
 You might ask, why would you want a system

37:39.600 --> 37:41.040
 that's low resolution?

37:41.040 --> 37:42.640
 Well, the low resolution system is better

37:42.640 --> 37:44.200
 at things like detecting motion

37:44.200 --> 37:46.600
 and not so much at detail and vice versa.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.080
 Now, again, you don't have to remember the names.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.400
 What you do have to remember, however,

37:50.400 --> 37:53.040
 is that you're going to create the maximum amount

37:53.040 --> 37:55.260
 of alertness in your system,

37:55.260 --> 37:57.720
 the maximum amount of ability to focus

37:57.720 --> 38:01.120
 when your system is in that parvocellular mode,

38:01.120 --> 38:03.960
 when you're bringing your eyes to a common point,

38:03.960 --> 38:07.840
 what we call a vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.080
 I've said this before on the podcast

38:09.080 --> 38:10.480
 and people said virgin eye movement.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.800
 No, vergence eye movement, as in convergence,

38:13.800 --> 38:16.720
 bringing your eyes to a single point in space

38:16.720 --> 38:19.740
 will create a narrower aperture of a visual window,

38:19.740 --> 38:21.880
 meaning your visual world actually shrinks,

38:21.880 --> 38:23.360
 at least perceptually.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.940
 Whereas when you relax your eyes and dilate your gaze,

38:26.940 --> 38:29.320
 you can do this now by whatever environment you're in,

38:29.320 --> 38:32.140
 trying to see without moving your head off to the side,

38:32.140 --> 38:34.820
 above, below you, as broadly as possible.

38:34.820 --> 38:36.320
 Maybe you can dilate your gaze so much

38:36.320 --> 38:38.300
 that you can see yourself, your body,

38:38.300 --> 38:39.300
 in that visual environment.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.760
 You'll notice that your resolution of vision

38:40.760 --> 38:42.280
 isn't nearly as high as when you do

38:42.280 --> 38:44.000
 that vergence eye movement.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.480
 Vergence eye movements are incredibly powerful

38:46.480 --> 38:48.960
 for creating heightened states of alertness and focus.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.840
 And indeed, they create heightened states

38:50.840 --> 38:52.920
 of cognition, of thinking.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.160
 And that's because your brain follows your vision

38:55.160 --> 38:56.760
 in terms of focus.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.340
 When we say, I can't focus,

38:58.340 --> 39:02.160
 what we often are experiencing is an inability,

39:02.160 --> 39:06.020
 excuse me, to not focus visually.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.680
 Whereas when we are in a very focused state,

39:07.680 --> 39:10.640
 we are in a state often where we can focus visually.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.560
 Now, we can also do this with our auditory system

39:12.560 --> 39:13.600
 or to touch, et cetera.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.720
 But right now we're just talking about the visual system.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.380
 Now, in terms of workspace optimization,

39:17.380 --> 39:20.520
 what this means is we never really want to be looking

39:20.520 --> 39:24.400
 at a square or rectangle or target area for our work

39:24.400 --> 39:26.720
 that is too far beyond our ears.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.060
 How far is too far?

39:28.060 --> 39:31.600
 Really, you want to try and keep the blinders on,

39:31.600 --> 39:33.240
 or I should say the invisible blinders,

39:33.240 --> 39:34.840
 so that whatever you're looking at falls

39:34.840 --> 39:37.560
 within the region of visual space in front of you

39:37.560 --> 39:39.640
 that is present if you were to cup your hands

39:39.640 --> 39:41.160
 and put them right next to your eyes.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.600
 Now, this is a rough estimation, but I'm doing this now.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.840
 For those of you that are watching on YouTube,

39:44.840 --> 39:45.800
 I'm doing this now.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.020
 I'm trying to simulate like a horse with blinders on.

39:48.020 --> 39:48.880
 For those of you that are listening,

39:48.880 --> 39:50.480
 just imagine me looking silly

39:50.480 --> 39:52.300
 with my hands cupped near my eyes.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.860
 But if we are to, for instance,

39:54.860 --> 39:56.960
 look at a screen that's very, very big

39:57.840 --> 39:58.920
 and we're too close to it,

39:58.920 --> 40:00.400
 or even if we're standing back from it,

40:00.400 --> 40:03.460
 it's going to be hard for us to attend to everything

40:03.460 --> 40:05.300
 within that screen space.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.240
 So this is actually support for the idea

40:08.240 --> 40:11.860
 of using a phone or a tablet or a laptop.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.840
 My laptop is about 15 inches in diameter,

40:13.840 --> 40:15.480
 I think is the one that I have.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.360
 Some are 13, some are 17.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.000
 Some of you like to use big monitors.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.880
 Make sure that whatever it is that you're looking at,

40:20.880 --> 40:22.480
 if you want to remain focused,

40:22.480 --> 40:26.840
 it doesn't extend too far beyond where your eyes are,

40:26.840 --> 40:28.300
 the size of your head that is.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.880
 So just think blinders on a horse.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.940
 And actually that's the reason they put blinders on a horse

40:31.940 --> 40:33.960
 so that they're not looking off into the periphery.

40:33.960 --> 40:37.440
 Horses, unlike humans, don't have the same shaped pupil.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.540
 They don't have a visual system

40:38.540 --> 40:40.040
 that's organized in quite the same way.

40:40.040 --> 40:44.020
 They mostly see in panorama, in magnocellular vision.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.440
 And so those blinders are designed

40:45.440 --> 40:47.200
 to keep their visual focus straight ahead.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.020
 So they physically restrict it.

40:49.020 --> 40:52.120
 Now, some people will actually go to lengths

40:52.120 --> 40:55.720
 to further restrict their visual focus.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.000
 They will do things like putting on a hoodie

40:58.000 --> 41:00.280
 or wearing a hat, for instance,

41:00.280 --> 41:01.960
 to restrict their visual window.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.540
 And indeed that works quite well.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.280
 But as we'll talk about in a moment,

41:05.280 --> 41:07.740
 when you really restrict your visual window

41:07.740 --> 41:12.060
 down to a very, very narrow portion of visual space,

41:12.060 --> 41:14.600
 that actually changes the types of information

41:14.600 --> 41:16.440
 that you are best at processing.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.140
 And we'll talk about that in terms of something

41:18.140 --> 41:20.780
 that's called the cathedral effect in a few moments.

41:20.780 --> 41:23.320
 But for now, here's the principle.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.880
 Make sure that whatever you're looking at

41:24.880 --> 41:26.080
 is directly in front of you

41:26.080 --> 41:28.600
 and doesn't extend too far out to the side.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.800
 Once you get out to say six or 12 or certainly 18 inches

41:32.800 --> 41:34.320
 on either side of your eyes,

41:34.320 --> 41:36.120
 you are dilating your gaze.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.780
 By definition, you're dilating your gaze.

41:37.780 --> 41:39.120
 It's completely subconscious,

41:39.120 --> 41:41.720
 and it becomes very hard to maintain attention.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.960
 Now, the caveat to this is that

41:43.960 --> 41:46.400
 if you are going to look at a narrow space,

41:46.400 --> 41:48.020
 a narrow window for any period of time,

41:48.020 --> 41:49.680
 whether or not it's a book or a laptop

41:49.680 --> 41:52.780
 or a tablet or a phone,

41:52.780 --> 41:55.940
 those virgins eye movements not only create alertness,

41:55.940 --> 41:57.880
 but they also require energy.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.800
 And they also can fatigue the eyes

41:59.800 --> 42:01.600
 because there's a process called accommodation

42:01.600 --> 42:04.440
 whereby the shape of your eye literally has to change

42:04.440 --> 42:05.580
 so that the lens can move

42:05.580 --> 42:07.280
 so that you can focus at that location.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.100
 Accommodation is an incredible process,

42:09.100 --> 42:10.400
 but it is a demanding one.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.620
 And that's the reason that your eyes get tired

42:12.620 --> 42:14.600
 when you focus on something for too long.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.560
 So here's a principle extracted

42:16.560 --> 42:18.840
 from the ophthalmology and neuroscience literature

42:18.840 --> 42:20.440
 that you can adopt.

42:20.440 --> 42:25.080
 For every 45 minutes in which you are focusing on something

42:25.080 --> 42:29.400
 like a phone or a tablet or a book page or your computer,

42:29.400 --> 42:33.400
 you want to get into magnocellular panoramic vision

42:33.400 --> 42:35.280
 for at least five minutes.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.740
 And the way that I suggest to do this

42:36.740 --> 42:39.060
 is actually to take a walk ideally outside.

42:39.060 --> 42:41.080
 We're going to talk about ambulation, about movement,

42:41.080 --> 42:42.700
 and about how that can maintain alertness

42:42.700 --> 42:43.760
 throughout the day.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.680
 So for every 45 minutes or so,

42:45.680 --> 42:48.240
 try and get five minutes of relaxing your eyes.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.980
 This is something that's not often done,

42:49.980 --> 42:52.140
 especially in today's homeschooling

42:52.140 --> 42:53.320
 and where people are,

42:53.320 --> 42:55.080
 where kids are going to school by Zoom

42:55.080 --> 42:56.800
 and adults are working by Zoom.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.040
 This is a serious problem.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.140
 People are getting eye fatigue.

43:00.140 --> 43:01.160
 They're getting headaches.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.600
 Indeed, some people are getting migraines.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.420
 They're having all sorts of issues, neck pain.

43:05.420 --> 43:09.640
 Much of that, if not all of that in some cases,

43:09.640 --> 43:12.240
 can be alleviated by this 45 to five rule.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.720
 For every 45 minutes of focused work that you do,

43:14.720 --> 43:17.200
 get five minutes where you get outside

43:17.200 --> 43:18.520
 or if you have to be indoors,

43:18.520 --> 43:20.220
 where you can dilate your gaze.

43:20.220 --> 43:21.780
 Now, some of you may be saying,

43:21.780 --> 43:24.880
 well, that spits in the face of your 90 minute rule.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.080
 You've told us before that we should focus for 90 minutes.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.600
 I would still want you to take breaks

43:28.600 --> 43:30.260
 within those 90 minutes

43:30.260 --> 43:33.740
 if you're looking at a narrow piece of visual world,

43:33.740 --> 43:36.380
 meaning at a phone or a laptop or so forth.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.280
 And again, the best way to do this would be to go outside,

43:38.280 --> 43:40.680
 just relax your eyes, look off into the distance.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.000
 Looking at a horizon will automatically trigger

43:43.000 --> 43:46.760
 this panoramic gaze, which is very relaxing to the eyes

43:46.760 --> 43:49.920
 and will allow you to go back into a focused work bout.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.740
 The one thing you absolutely do not want to do

43:52.740 --> 43:54.940
 is to go outside and check your phone

43:54.940 --> 43:56.520
 because if you're outside checking your phone

43:56.520 --> 43:57.800
 or you're taking a break and checking your phone,

43:57.800 --> 44:00.320
 you're still in that vergence eye movement, okay?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.200
 So this is very, very important

44:02.200 --> 44:06.900
 because vergence eye movements increase focus and attention,

44:06.900 --> 44:09.400
 and you can exploit that to increase focus and attention

44:09.400 --> 44:10.320
 when you want to,

44:10.320 --> 44:13.440
 but you absolutely need to relax the system.

44:13.440 --> 44:14.760
 Again, for every 45 minutes

44:14.760 --> 44:16.520
 in which you've been in that focused mode,

44:16.520 --> 44:20.240
 you want to get at least five minutes of panoramic vision.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.980
 If you can take a 15 minute walk, even better.

44:22.980 --> 44:24.040
 Next, I'd like to talk about

44:24.040 --> 44:26.440
 an aspect of workspace optimization

44:26.440 --> 44:28.360
 that can actually bias whether or not

44:28.360 --> 44:31.120
 our brain and nervous system are better suited

44:31.120 --> 44:36.040
 for detailed analytic work or more abstract work.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.280
 In fact, there's a way

44:37.280 --> 44:39.560
 that you can arrange your work environment,

44:39.560 --> 44:42.800
 or I should say there's a way that you can place yourself

44:42.800 --> 44:46.760
 into certain environments that will allow abstract thinking,

44:46.760 --> 44:51.100
 creative thinking, and indeed expansive thinking to emerge.

44:51.100 --> 44:53.620
 There are other environments that you can put yourself in

44:53.620 --> 44:55.400
 that will make your brain shift

44:55.400 --> 44:56.960
 towards more analytic work,

44:56.960 --> 45:00.080
 toward more detailed and precise types of work.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.680
 Now, I just briefly want to mention

45:01.680 --> 45:04.320
 something that was covered again on the habits episode

45:04.320 --> 45:05.900
 that I did a few weeks ago,

45:05.900 --> 45:07.620
 but again, you don't need to see that episode

45:07.620 --> 45:09.800
 in order to digest this information.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.440
 It goes back to this issue of three phases

45:12.440 --> 45:14.940
 within the circadian 24 hour cycle.

45:14.940 --> 45:16.640
 Phase one, which as I mentioned,

45:16.640 --> 45:19.020
 is about zero to eight hours after waking.

45:19.020 --> 45:21.400
 Phase two, nine to 16 hours after waking.

45:21.400 --> 45:24.520
 And phase three, 17 to 24 hours after waking.

45:24.520 --> 45:27.920
 Phase one, being ideal for analytic,

45:27.920 --> 45:30.920
 precise, detailed types of work.

45:30.920 --> 45:33.500
 Phase two, better suited for most people

45:33.500 --> 45:35.660
 for creative kind of abstract thinking,

45:35.660 --> 45:39.040
 expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.880
 There are some exceptions to that,

45:40.880 --> 45:43.480
 but most people follow that pattern

45:43.480 --> 45:45.520
 because of the different neuromodulators

45:45.520 --> 45:46.720
 and hormones and so forth

45:46.720 --> 45:48.380
 that are released into the brain and body

45:48.380 --> 45:49.880
 at those different phases.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.460
 What I'm about to tell you is a way

45:53.460 --> 45:56.020
 in which you can use your physical environment

45:56.020 --> 45:59.000
 to further shift your brain and nervous system

45:59.000 --> 46:01.800
 into a mode that's either primed for analytic

46:01.800 --> 46:04.020
 or abstract and creative thinking.

46:04.020 --> 46:07.020
 What I'm about to describe is called the cathedral effect.

46:07.020 --> 46:10.240
 The cathedral effect has been discussed,

46:10.240 --> 46:12.080
 well, really for many, many decades,

46:12.080 --> 46:13.320
 maybe even hundreds of years,

46:13.320 --> 46:16.560
 but formally has been discussed since the early 2000s

46:16.560 --> 46:18.520
 in which it seemed that people

46:18.520 --> 46:21.760
 who were in high ceilinged environments,

46:21.760 --> 46:23.700
 hence the phrase cathedral,

46:23.700 --> 46:27.040
 would shift their thinking and their ideas

46:27.040 --> 46:30.360
 to more abstract and creative lofty type thinking.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.860
 So literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking,

46:32.860 --> 46:34.640
 higher aspirations.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.900
 This was observed in terms of the language that they use,

46:37.900 --> 46:40.560
 but also the sorts of ideas that they would generate.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.840
 And conversely, that people

46:43.840 --> 46:46.680
 that were in lower ceilinged environments

46:46.680 --> 46:51.060
 would be more oriented toward using language

46:51.060 --> 46:53.760
 that was more restricted, literally more detailed,

46:53.760 --> 46:56.600
 analytic about things in their immediate space.

46:56.600 --> 46:59.160
 Now, this seems kind of wild on the one hand,

46:59.160 --> 47:01.880
 but actually if we go back to our understanding

47:01.880 --> 47:03.720
 of the neurobiology of the visual system

47:03.720 --> 47:07.120
 and the way that our brains and bodies evolved

47:07.120 --> 47:10.000
 in different environments, it actually makes a lot of sense.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.540
 We don't have time to go into a long lecture

47:11.540 --> 47:13.320
 about evolutionary neurobiology,

47:13.320 --> 47:15.460
 but we have to remember that our nervous system

47:15.460 --> 47:16.360
 has a number of features

47:16.360 --> 47:18.040
 that are adapted to different environments.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.840
 And indeed we are able to go from big open prairies

47:21.840 --> 47:25.840
 or mountain tops or large cathedrals or concert halls

47:25.840 --> 47:29.360
 into small environments and everything scales with it.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.320
 When we're outdoors in a big expansive space,

47:31.320 --> 47:32.760
 our vision tends to go long.

47:32.760 --> 47:35.520
 We tend to be in panoramic, magnocellular vision.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.280
 Our hearing tends to extend long.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.200
 Even if we're having a conversation with somebody,

47:39.200 --> 47:41.760
 we tend to also be attending somewhat

47:41.760 --> 47:44.840
 to the screech of hawks off in the distance

47:44.840 --> 47:46.240
 or to the rush of a river.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.980
 Whereas when we were in small spaces,

47:47.980 --> 47:50.400
 everything, our vision, our hearing,

47:50.400 --> 47:52.000
 and indeed even our physical movements

47:52.000 --> 47:52.920
 become more restrained,

47:52.920 --> 47:54.760
 even if we can still extend our hands out

47:54.760 --> 47:56.160
 as far as we want.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.120
 What do I mean by that?

47:57.120 --> 47:59.080
 Let's say you're in an elevator.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.480
 That's a small space compared to outside on a field.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.060
 This has been measured over and over again.

48:04.060 --> 48:06.940
 People's, the size or the amplitude

48:06.940 --> 48:08.360
 of people's spontaneous movements

48:08.360 --> 48:10.680
 actually scales down in smaller environments

48:10.680 --> 48:12.040
 even if they aren't completely restricted

48:12.040 --> 48:13.700
 from extending their limbs all the way.

48:13.700 --> 48:14.960
 Whereas when we were outdoors,

48:14.960 --> 48:18.600
 we feel a natural impulse to move further

48:18.600 --> 48:22.400
 away from our body, our torso with our limbs.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.220
 This is just feels like more appropriate behavior.

48:25.220 --> 48:26.100
 And when I say appropriate,

48:26.100 --> 48:30.740
 I don't mean in any kind of social context necessarily.

48:30.740 --> 48:32.080
 There's actually a reason for this.

48:32.080 --> 48:35.560
 The visual system and the so-called vestibular motor system

48:35.560 --> 48:37.200
 are intimately linked.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.240
 And I can just tell you briefly one way

48:39.240 --> 48:40.740
 in which you can test this and observe this

48:40.740 --> 48:41.600
 and even use this.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.400
 It's a little off topic from today's episode,

48:43.400 --> 48:46.400
 but let's say you have a certain amount of flexibility.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.000
 You can extend your arms off like wings

48:49.000 --> 48:50.400
 is what I'm doing for those either listening,

48:50.400 --> 48:52.560
 not watching, off to your sides with arms straight.

48:52.560 --> 48:57.140
 And you reach a maximum positioning of flexibility.

48:58.160 --> 49:03.160
 You can do a quick experiment where you sit still.

49:03.320 --> 49:04.720
 You would bring your arms in for a moment.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.040
 You can put them on your knees if you like

49:06.040 --> 49:07.240
 or in front of you.

49:07.240 --> 49:10.520
 And you can move your eyes very far off

49:10.520 --> 49:12.040
 into the periphery of your visual field.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.480
 So you actually, I'm going to do this now.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.320
 It looks kind of silly,

49:14.320 --> 49:15.920
 but moving my eyes without moving my head

49:15.920 --> 49:19.320
 off into the periphery all the way to the right,

49:19.320 --> 49:20.720
 then all the way to the left,

49:20.720 --> 49:21.980
 all the way up, all the way down,

49:21.980 --> 49:23.480
 but especially all the way to the left,

49:23.480 --> 49:25.600
 almost looking over my shoulder

49:25.600 --> 49:28.600
 without turning my head all the way to my right.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.800
 And you will find that you actually can extend

49:31.800 --> 49:34.080
 your arms further back subsequent to that.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.400
 And that's not magic.

49:35.400 --> 49:38.160
 It has to do with the ways in which your cerebellum,

49:38.160 --> 49:39.520
 which actually means mini brain,

49:39.520 --> 49:42.080
 and your eyes, your visual system are connected,

49:42.080 --> 49:44.060
 and the way in which your cerebellum controls

49:44.060 --> 49:45.740
 some of the spindles and other aspects

49:45.740 --> 49:48.680
 of the neuromuscular architecture of your nervous system,

49:48.680 --> 49:50.080
 because your nerves control your muscles,

49:50.080 --> 49:52.560
 and allow those muscles to move further out.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.280
 So for those of you that lack flexibility,

49:54.280 --> 49:56.480
 you can actually exploit your visual system for this.

49:56.480 --> 49:58.280
 Now that's, again, a bit of a tangent,

49:58.280 --> 49:59.840
 but it's a fun one that relates back

49:59.840 --> 50:02.200
 to this so-called cathedral effect.

50:02.200 --> 50:05.880
 The cathedral effect is a way in which our thinking

50:05.880 --> 50:07.900
 becomes more restricted and restrained

50:07.900 --> 50:11.640
 in tighter, smaller, more confined visual environments.

50:11.640 --> 50:16.100
 Or if the ceiling is higher, we are in expansive space

50:16.100 --> 50:20.040
 with a lot of distance above us or space above us

50:20.040 --> 50:21.880
 and out to the sides, maybe even out on a field,

50:21.880 --> 50:24.960
 our thinking goes into these more broad,

50:24.960 --> 50:29.920
 abstract, and loftier future thinking in particular.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.480
 This has actually been measured.

50:31.480 --> 50:32.600
 There's a really nice paper.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.840
 I will post a link to this.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.260
 The authors are Joan Myers Levy and Rui,

50:37.260 --> 50:39.040
 and then in parentheses, Juliet Zou.

50:39.040 --> 50:41.080
 I'm going to assume that they go by Juliet.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.480
 The title of the paper is the influence of ceiling height,

50:43.480 --> 50:45.400
 the effect of priming on the type of processing

50:45.400 --> 50:46.320
 that people use.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.220
 And I won't go into all the details of this paper,

50:48.220 --> 50:50.840
 but what's really cool about this paper

50:50.840 --> 50:52.840
 is they looked with very rigorous statistics,

50:52.840 --> 50:55.040
 and they have a fair number of subjects,

50:55.040 --> 50:57.240
 and everything about this paper looks solid to me,

50:57.240 --> 51:00.720
 at the difference in cognitive processing

51:00.720 --> 51:03.880
 and abstract thinking and detailed analytic work

51:03.880 --> 51:07.360
 that people are able to perform in environments

51:07.360 --> 51:10.440
 that have a 10-foot ceiling versus an eight-foot ceiling,

51:10.440 --> 51:12.400
 which is not that much of a difference.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.960
 It's just two-foot difference there.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.360
 And what they found were significant effects

51:17.360 --> 51:19.840
 whereby high ceilings activate concepts

51:19.840 --> 51:22.160
 related to abstraction,

51:22.160 --> 51:25.560
 whereas low ceilings prime confinement-related concepts

51:25.560 --> 51:28.080
 but promote the kind of detailed thinking

51:28.080 --> 51:31.600
 that lends itself well to sort of spreadsheet-type work

51:31.600 --> 51:33.180
 or accounting-type work,

51:33.180 --> 51:35.280
 whereas abstract creative work was supported

51:35.280 --> 51:36.720
 by these higher ceilings.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.820
 And the way they analyze this was really interesting.

51:38.820 --> 51:40.760
 Again, we don't have time to go into all the details,

51:40.760 --> 51:45.160
 but they asked people to sort of generate word sets

51:45.160 --> 51:47.920
 related to particular topics like sports.

51:47.920 --> 51:50.040
 And so people would talk about soccer, football,

51:50.040 --> 51:51.400
 baseball, golf, et cetera,

51:51.400 --> 51:53.000
 and talk about some of the equipment and other things.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.680
 And then they had a kind of a challenge,

51:56.680 --> 51:57.520
 a cognitive challenge,

51:57.520 --> 51:59.840
 whereby people had to link different concepts

51:59.840 --> 52:01.240
 along different dimensions

52:01.240 --> 52:03.040
 so that you depart from the dimension of sport

52:03.040 --> 52:05.640
 and you start thinking about sports that involve teams

52:05.640 --> 52:07.640
 or sports that involve a ball, et cetera.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.700
 And so in the same conditions,

52:09.700 --> 52:11.320
 you can, except for the fact

52:11.320 --> 52:14.040
 that the ceiling height is different, eight feet or 10 feet,

52:14.040 --> 52:16.480
 what one finds is that the kinds of language

52:16.480 --> 52:17.800
 and the kinds of associations

52:17.800 --> 52:20.160
 that people start to create are vastly different.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.560
 And there are actually two experiments in this study.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.920
 You're welcome to go look at it.

52:23.920 --> 52:25.180
 So it wasn't just about sports.

52:25.180 --> 52:27.640
 There were some other things that were analyzed as well.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.740
 And in the references of this paper,

52:29.740 --> 52:31.640
 it also points to other examples now

52:31.640 --> 52:33.040
 of the cathedral effect,

52:33.040 --> 52:34.840
 which I find very interesting

52:34.840 --> 52:36.520
 because as a vision scientist

52:36.520 --> 52:38.360
 and someone who spends his life thinking about

52:38.360 --> 52:40.940
 and indeed talking about the nervous system,

52:40.940 --> 52:43.520
 we know that our cognition follows our vision.

52:43.520 --> 52:45.960
 For low vision or blind people,

52:45.960 --> 52:47.760
 it will follow mostly their hearing

52:47.760 --> 52:49.080
 and to some extent their touch.

52:49.080 --> 52:51.360
 But for most people who are sighted,

52:51.360 --> 52:52.640
 as most people are sighted,

52:52.640 --> 52:56.600
 our cognition follows our visual environment.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.640
 So what does this mean for workspace optimization?

52:58.640 --> 53:01.520
 Well, most of us have a fixed ceiling level

53:01.520 --> 53:03.040
 in our home,

53:03.040 --> 53:05.120
 but you might have rooms in which the ceiling is higher

53:05.120 --> 53:06.720
 and rooms in which the ceiling is lower.

53:06.720 --> 53:07.560
 If that were the case,

53:07.560 --> 53:09.160
 I recommend if you want to do creative work

53:09.160 --> 53:10.000
 during phase two,

53:10.000 --> 53:13.840
 the nine to 16 hours of your circadian cycle,

53:13.840 --> 53:15.780
 nine to 16 hours after waking, that is,

53:15.780 --> 53:17.200
 that you do that in the high ceiling room

53:17.200 --> 53:19.960
 or maybe even outdoors out on a deck or on a patio

53:19.960 --> 53:22.400
 because the highest ceiling of course is the sky.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.560
 Whereas if you're going to do detailed analytic work in,

53:26.560 --> 53:28.680
 I would suggest doing that during phase one of the day.

53:28.680 --> 53:29.680
 But even if you're going to do it

53:29.680 --> 53:31.120
 during phase two of the day,

53:31.120 --> 53:32.080
 for whatever reason,

53:32.080 --> 53:34.260
 scheduling or other sorts of constraints,

53:34.260 --> 53:36.620
 that you do that in the lower ceiling environment.

53:36.620 --> 53:39.220
 Now, if you are interested in controlling your,

53:39.220 --> 53:40.520
 the height of your visual world,

53:40.520 --> 53:42.480
 but you don't have control over your,

53:42.480 --> 53:44.720
 the ceiling height of the environment that you're in,

53:44.720 --> 53:46.080
 there is another way to do that.

53:46.080 --> 53:47.760
 And I used to observe this in the cafes

53:47.760 --> 53:49.320
 and around Stanford in the Bay area

53:49.320 --> 53:51.480
 where you would see somebody who,

53:51.480 --> 53:53.240
 despite the weather would be in a hoodie,

53:53.240 --> 53:55.960
 maybe with a baseball cap or other form of hat

53:55.960 --> 53:59.700
 or some sort of blinder above their eyebrows,

53:59.700 --> 54:01.680
 which is actually another way of just lowering

54:01.680 --> 54:03.480
 the ceiling height very, very low

54:03.480 --> 54:04.760
 and restricting your visual field.

54:04.760 --> 54:06.840
 Not unlike blinders that we talked about before

54:06.840 --> 54:07.960
 that one would put on a horse

54:07.960 --> 54:09.640
 or one would put on them themselves

54:09.640 --> 54:12.440
 by restricting their visual angle of focus

54:12.440 --> 54:13.440
 to directly in front of them,

54:13.440 --> 54:15.960
 but not too far out beyond the sides of their head.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.800
 So these cathedral effects,

54:17.800 --> 54:18.880
 I think can be leveraged

54:18.880 --> 54:21.360
 toward doing particular types of work best.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.000
 And again, the lower the ceiling

54:23.000 --> 54:25.200
 or the lower your visual environment,

54:25.200 --> 54:27.120
 the more that one tends to do,

54:27.120 --> 54:32.120
 or I should say, performs detailed analytic work accurately.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.160
 And the more that one's thinking is oriented

54:35.160 --> 54:38.460
 towards detailed sort of correct answer type work.

54:39.760 --> 54:42.560
 Whereas when the ceiling is higher or there's no ceiling,

54:42.560 --> 54:46.020
 the more that the brain and the rest of the processing

54:46.020 --> 54:47.960
 that we call cognitive processing

54:47.960 --> 54:51.160
 is related to abstract reasoning, brainstorming,

54:51.160 --> 54:55.240
 and indeed can pull from broader swaths of memory resources.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.440
 Because really what abstract reasoning is,

54:57.440 --> 54:59.180
 is it's taking existing elements

54:59.180 --> 55:02.520
 and maneuvering them or arranging them into novel ways.

55:02.520 --> 55:05.040
 So you can think about like notes on a piano,

55:05.040 --> 55:06.880
 playing a particular song, learning scales,

55:06.880 --> 55:07.800
 that's very analytic.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.280
 There's a correct answer

55:09.280 --> 55:11.420
 that you're trying to arrive at or generate.

55:11.420 --> 55:14.300
 Whereas writing music or writing poetry

55:14.300 --> 55:17.960
 or generating new material of any kind

55:17.960 --> 55:19.800
 involves taking existing elements, right?

55:19.800 --> 55:20.620
 You're not going to use words

55:20.620 --> 55:22.580
 that you don't have committed to your memory

55:22.580 --> 55:24.140
 or that you're not aware of,

55:24.140 --> 55:26.080
 and arranging them in novel ways.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.440
 So I think the cathedral effect can be leveraged.

55:28.440 --> 55:30.460
 And again, you don't need to move into a different home

55:30.460 --> 55:33.360
 or build a slanted roof and work at one side of the room

55:33.360 --> 55:34.200
 at one part of the day

55:34.200 --> 55:35.160
 and the other side of the room at the other.

55:35.160 --> 55:38.320
 Although, hey, if that's the way you want to swing it,

55:38.320 --> 55:39.160
 that's great.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.020
 Most of us don't have that flexibility,

55:41.020 --> 55:44.380
 but it's very clear that the height of the ceiling

55:44.380 --> 55:45.800
 of the visual environment that we're in

55:45.800 --> 55:48.720
 has a profound effect on the types of cognitive processes

55:48.720 --> 55:50.400
 that we are able to engage.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.860
 Now I'd like to shift our attention

55:51.860 --> 55:53.840
 to the auditory environment

55:53.840 --> 55:56.280
 or the noise in the room or the music in the room

55:56.280 --> 55:58.240
 or the music or noise in the headphones,

55:58.240 --> 56:00.960
 because it turns out that there is a lot

56:00.960 --> 56:03.640
 of quality scientific data out there

56:03.640 --> 56:08.120
 that speaks to whether or not listening to particular sounds

56:08.120 --> 56:10.280
 can enhance our cognition.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.800
 And indeed the answer is yes,

56:11.800 --> 56:14.840
 but there are very particular types of things to listen to

56:14.840 --> 56:17.120
 under very particular types of conditions

56:17.120 --> 56:19.120
 that allow one to do that.

56:19.120 --> 56:22.900
 First off, I want to say that people vary tremendously

56:22.900 --> 56:24.480
 in the extent to which they can tolerate

56:24.480 --> 56:26.800
 background noise for work.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.160
 In fact, individuals will vary tremendously

56:30.160 --> 56:32.700
 from one day to the next, or even within the same day

56:32.700 --> 56:35.680
 in the extent to which they can tolerate background noise.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.040
 I've experienced this myself.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.000
 There've been times in which I've been working at home

56:39.000 --> 56:40.940
 and I felt like for whatever reason,

56:40.940 --> 56:42.800
 I just could not engage in focus.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.480
 And what worked to generate more focus for me

56:46.480 --> 56:49.240
 was to go to a cafe or to a library

56:49.240 --> 56:51.440
 or someplace where there's actually more commotion,

56:51.440 --> 56:53.440
 more people moving about, maybe even more noise,

56:53.440 --> 56:55.120
 maybe even music in the room.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.140
 And we have to all be in touch

56:57.140 --> 56:59.140
 with when we want more background noise

56:59.140 --> 57:00.880
 or when we want less background noise.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.760
 There is no hard and fast rule.

57:02.760 --> 57:05.240
 If you look across the literature

57:05.240 --> 57:10.040
 for studies that involve complete silence or white noise

57:10.040 --> 57:13.120
 or binaural beats or music or classical music

57:13.120 --> 57:13.960
 or rock and roll,

57:13.960 --> 57:17.720
 you can find results to support any type of environment

57:17.720 --> 57:19.600
 as being more beneficial.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.320
 However, as we'll talk about in a moment,

57:21.320 --> 57:23.680
 there are a few types of environments to really avoid

57:23.680 --> 57:26.920
 and a few types of sounds that really can enhance

57:26.920 --> 57:28.920
 the cognition and your ability to focus

57:28.920 --> 57:31.540
 in your workspace environment across the board

57:31.540 --> 57:33.540
 that really seem to work for all people.

57:33.540 --> 57:36.040
 Let's talk about background noise to avoid.

57:36.040 --> 57:37.960
 And here we're talking about background noise to avoid

57:37.960 --> 57:39.960
 because it actually can cause

57:39.960 --> 57:42.780
 some pretty severe deficits in cognition.

57:42.780 --> 57:46.680
 There's a paper, first author, Jordan Love, cool name.

57:46.680 --> 57:48.880
 Last author, Alexander Francis.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.920
 The title of the paper has to do with

57:51.920 --> 57:54.800
 psychophysiological responses to potentially annoying

57:54.800 --> 57:56.860
 heating ventilation and air conditioning noise

57:56.860 --> 57:59.780
 during mentally demanding work, which is a mouthful.

57:59.780 --> 58:04.740
 But basically what this paper identifies is a large dataset

58:04.740 --> 58:06.760
 in which workplace and environmental noise,

58:06.760 --> 58:09.240
 mostly the humming of air conditioners that's very loud

58:09.240 --> 58:11.500
 or the humming of heaters that's very loud and ongoing,

58:11.500 --> 58:13.780
 just incessant, doesn't let up,

58:13.780 --> 58:16.240
 can really increase mental fatigue

58:16.240 --> 58:18.940
 and can vastly decrease cognitive performance.

58:18.940 --> 58:20.300
 And if you're interested in looking at the cognitive

58:20.300 --> 58:25.120
 performance data, the authors are Banbury and Berry, 2005.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.280
 That paper is the one that supports the fact

58:27.280 --> 58:29.160
 that cognitive performance is worse

58:29.160 --> 58:31.240
 when there's just the hum of an air conditioner

58:31.240 --> 58:32.720
 in the background or the hum of a heater

58:32.720 --> 58:35.800
 and otherwise complete silence.

58:35.800 --> 58:38.480
 There's also evidence, which I discussed on the episode

58:38.480 --> 58:41.280
 about hearing, which is that in young children,

58:41.280 --> 58:44.680
 white noise can cause some impairments in the development

58:44.680 --> 58:46.600
 of the auditory system.

58:46.600 --> 58:48.080
 Now, I don't want parents to freak out.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.820
 And if you're exposed to white noise as a sleep aid,

58:50.820 --> 58:55.300
 as a child, which I know many of you were, don't freak out.

58:55.300 --> 58:56.840
 But it turns out that white noise,

58:56.840 --> 58:58.380
 especially if it's loud white noise,

58:58.380 --> 59:00.720
 can cause some disruption in the auditory maps,

59:00.720 --> 59:03.360
 the representation of different frequencies of sound

59:03.360 --> 59:06.720
 in the brain that can lead to some deficits in auditory

59:06.720 --> 59:08.280
 and even language processing.

59:08.280 --> 59:11.760
 So we really have to be careful about long-term exposure,

59:11.760 --> 59:16.080
 extended exposure to white noise or air conditioning noise

59:16.080 --> 59:17.240
 that's really at a high level.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.720
 I wouldn't worry if it's in the background

59:18.720 --> 59:20.840
 and it's shutting off and turning on again

59:20.840 --> 59:23.720
 as the thermostat kicks off and on,

59:23.720 --> 59:28.200
 but really trying to avoid work in loud fan-filled

59:28.200 --> 59:32.420
 or ventilation generating or heat generating environments,

59:32.420 --> 59:34.300
 because it really can cause damage

59:34.300 --> 59:35.960
 to the auditory system long-term.

59:35.960 --> 59:39.640
 And as we described, it can impair cognitive performance

59:39.640 --> 59:41.140
 and overall increase fatigue.

59:41.140 --> 59:43.260
 I think we've all experienced that when you're in a room

59:43.260 --> 59:44.840
 and there's some ongoing background noise

59:44.840 --> 59:45.940
 and all of a sudden it stops

59:45.940 --> 59:48.320
 and you just feel this enormous relief.

59:48.320 --> 59:52.200
 And the reason for this is that our auditory system

59:52.200 --> 59:53.880
 has a parallel to our visual system.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.200
 In our visual system, that light entering the eyes

59:56.200 --> 59:58.280
 triggers the activation of those melanopsin cells,

59:58.280 --> 1:00:00.280
 which triggers activation of the hypothalamus,

1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:01.920
 a particular area of the hypothalamus,

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:04.280
 which generates alertness, generates the release

1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:06.920
 even of cortisol, a stress hormone.

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:09.960
 In the auditory system, when there's ongoing sound,

1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:11.840
 your auditory system hears that,

1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:13.600
 even if you're not paying attention to it,

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:14.840
 if you're paying attention to something else,

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:17.000
 it still registers those little hair cells,

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:18.480
 as they're called in your inner ear,

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.000
 are fluttering, the eardrum is beating

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.520
 and in concert to that sound frequency.

1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:27.380
 And there's a brainstem mechanism that generates alertness

1:00:27.380 --> 1:00:28.320
 and a kind of vigilance.

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.720
 So when you have a sound that's ongoing in the background,

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:33.600
 it shuts off, all of a sudden you experience that piece,

1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:35.760
 which is the turning off of those brainstem circuits

1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:37.520
 that are associated with vigilance.

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:39.620
 The locus coeruleus, which we talked about earlier,

1:00:39.620 --> 1:00:42.440
 which release epinephrine and norepinephrine

1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:44.180
 and generate that heightened state of alertness

1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:46.800
 in your brain and body, those neurons then can turn off

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:48.620
 and you experience that as relaxation.

1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:51.000
 So does that mean that we shouldn't listen to white noise

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.480
 or pink noise or brown noise while we're working?

1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:54.660
 Certainly a lot of people do.

1:00:54.660 --> 1:00:56.760
 In fact, if you want to know what white noise,

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:58.380
 pink noise and brown noise are,

1:00:58.380 --> 1:01:00.900
 they're just different constellations

1:01:00.900 --> 1:01:03.360
 of auditory frequencies that are played together.

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:07.080
 Most of us think of white noise as the shh on a screen,

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:09.680
 all the black and white pixels going all around,

1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:11.140
 like they call it visual snow.

1:01:12.420 --> 1:01:16.860
 But pink noise has certain sound frequencies

1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:18.460
 notched out, taken out.

1:01:18.460 --> 1:01:19.580
 Brown noise has others.

1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:22.120
 It has different frequencies that are included

1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:23.600
 at higher amplitude, et cetera.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:25.240
 You can look this stuff up on YouTube if you want.

1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:26.320
 You just put brown noise.

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:27.560
 None of it sounds terrific.

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:28.440
 It doesn't sound like music.

1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:29.560
 It's literally just noise,

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:32.120
 mixed frequencies and no particular arrangement.

1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:34.720
 There is some evidence that playing white noise

1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:36.960
 in the background or on headphones or pink noise

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:39.540
 or brown noise can facilitate cognition,

1:01:39.540 --> 1:01:41.600
 but it's mainly through an increase

1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:45.680
 in this overall alertness as a consequence

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:48.280
 of areas like locus coeruleus and other brainstem areas

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:51.320
 that are associated with autonomic arousal from that noise.

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.240
 So it's a lot like the air conditioner effect.

1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:55.520
 And I think done in a restricted way,

1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:57.240
 meaning not for hours and hours,

1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:59.620
 but maybe if your focus is waning

1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:01.760
 and you're having a hard time engaging in work,

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:03.720
 you might put on some brown noise or white noise

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.580
 or pink noise and work that way for 45 minutes or so

1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:08.620
 before you go to your panoramic vision walk

1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:09.720
 and get some sunlight.

1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:11.320
 That should be fine.

1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:13.440
 There's really no reason to suspect, however,

1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:15.720
 that those particular patterns of noise

1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:19.500
 are going to optimize particular mental functions.

1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:21.660
 So what I'd like to turn to next

1:02:21.660 --> 1:02:23.960
 are particular patterns of sounds

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:26.160
 that indeed have been shown in peer-reviewed studies

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:29.040
 to optimize certain types of mental processing,

1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:30.320
 because you can incorporate these

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.540
 into your optimized workspace environment

1:02:33.540 --> 1:02:35.060
 through headphones or through speakers,

1:02:35.060 --> 1:02:36.800
 whatever mechanism that you want

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:39.560
 in order to get more out of your work efforts.

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:42.100
 If you were to search for apps or go online

1:02:42.100 --> 1:02:45.840
 and try and find sounds that can improve thinking

1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:47.600
 or change your emotions,

1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:49.800
 you're generally going to find three types.

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.880
 One are called isochronic tones.

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:55.020
 These are tones usually of a common frequency.

1:02:55.020 --> 1:02:58.360
 So it might be a beep and then a pause

1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:01.200
 and then beep of the same frequency and then beep.

1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:04.000
 Forgive my terrible beeping.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.640
 I don't know what good beeping would sound like,

1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:10.320
 but contrast isochronic tones with monaural beats.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.420
 Monaural beats would be repetitive,

1:03:12.420 --> 1:03:15.920
 almost percussive-like beats delivered to just one ear.

1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:18.520
 Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:19.360
 this kind of thing.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:21.760
 Okay, you can find apps that can deliver monaural beats.

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:26.200
 You can find also apps that deliver so-called binaural beats.

1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:28.540
 You can also find YouTube scripts or channels

1:03:28.540 --> 1:03:29.960
 that will deliver binaural beats.

1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:31.660
 Binaural beats, as the name suggests,

1:03:31.660 --> 1:03:34.080
 are beats delivered to the two ears.

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:36.620
 One pattern of kind of percussive beat to one ear

1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:38.400
 and a different pattern,

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.560
 or at least a pattern that's out of phase,

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:43.180
 that's not synchronized, delivered to the other ear.

1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:45.160
 So on one ear, you hear doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:48.080
 and then the other ear, you've got doo, doo, doo.

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:50.680
 And what happens is because of the way

1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:53.760
 that the auditory system converges in the brainstem

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:57.200
 and generates what are called intraoral time differences,

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:58.400
 I'll explain what that means in a moment,

1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:00.320
 intraoral time differences,

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:03.200
 the difference between the two patterns of beats

1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:06.920
 that are heard by each of the two different ears

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:10.960
 leads to a third pattern that the brain entrains to

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:12.280
 and kind of maps onto

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:15.360
 and generates particular types of brain waves, okay?

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.560
 So without going into a lot of detail,

1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:19.780
 intraoral time differences are the ways

1:04:19.780 --> 1:04:22.380
 in which if you were to hear something off to your right,

1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:23.780
 like I just snapped my finger

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:25.980
 just to the right of my right ear,

1:04:25.980 --> 1:04:29.800
 that a signal arrives in my right ear

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:32.040
 before that sound signal,

1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:33.480
 those sound waves arrive in my left ear.

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.720
 So there's an intraoral between ears time difference.

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:41.560
 And there's a brainstem area in which signals from one ear

1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:43.360
 and signals from the other ear converge,

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:46.320
 and there's literally a math done by your nervous system

1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:50.040
 that says this signal arrived before the other signal.

1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:51.680
 And the difference between those signals

1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:53.160
 is the intraoral time difference.

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.560
 So if I were to snap my fingers on both sides,

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:58.600
 on my left and on my right side at the exact same time,

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.120
 and they arrive at the same time,

1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:01.600
 the intraoral time difference is zero.

1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:04.680
 Whereas if one goes first on the right and then the left,

1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:05.880
 I'm terrible at snapping on the left.

1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:07.720
 It's a weak snap, but it was there.

1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:09.860
 Then there's a delay in the intraoral time difference

1:05:09.860 --> 1:05:11.140
 has a particular value.

1:05:11.140 --> 1:05:11.980
 Okay, you get it.

1:05:11.980 --> 1:05:13.800
 It's almost ridiculously simple.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:16.500
 Binaural beats have been generated

1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:20.280
 in ways that create a particular pattern

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:21.840
 of intraoral time differences

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:25.240
 that then cascades up to the rest of the brain

1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:27.600
 and puts the forebrain and other areas of the brain

1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:29.520
 that are involved in cognition and action

1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:30.880
 into a particular rhythm.

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:34.120
 And some of the rhythms or waves of brain activity

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:35.360
 are ones that you may have heard of.

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:39.280
 Things like alpha waves or theta waves or gamma waves.

1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:41.040
 Now, I don't like to get too attached

1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:42.960
 to particular brain waves

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:45.720
 as excellent for particular kinds of thinking.

1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:47.160
 This is something that was really popular

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:48.920
 in the 90s and 2000s

1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:52.800
 when ways of measuring brain activity noninvasively

1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:55.040
 with electrodes on the outside

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.460
 enabled people to identify

1:05:56.460 --> 1:05:58.200
 that indeed alpha brain waves

1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.840
 are associated with alertness states

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:01.600
 and some are other brain waves

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:04.080
 that are kind of larger amplitude, slow waves,

1:06:04.080 --> 1:06:06.680
 like delta waves are associated

1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:08.920
 with kind of sleepiness or relaxation.

1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:10.980
 But in general, the way that the brain works

1:06:10.980 --> 1:06:11.960
 is that different brain waves

1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:13.880
 are generated in different structures at different times

1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:17.640
 and those combine to give us a sense of happiness

1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:19.360
 or give us a sense of focus

1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:21.340
 or give us a sense of creativity.

1:06:21.340 --> 1:06:24.440
 Nonetheless, if you look across the board

1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:26.200
 at the studies of binaural beats

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:29.280
 and you ask what sorts of binaural beats

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:32.360
 appear to be useful for people to enhance

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:34.960
 their brain function for particular kinds of tasks,

1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:37.720
 we arrive at some very interesting answers.

1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:39.640
 So we'll review what those are now.

1:06:39.640 --> 1:06:41.220
 The frequency of binaural beats

1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:43.040
 that appears to bring about

1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:47.520
 improved cognitive functioning at the level of memory,

1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.640
 improved reaction times,

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:54.640
 and improved verbal recall seems to be 40 Hertz.

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:57.460
 Now, is it exactly 40 Hertz?

1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:58.420
 We don't know,

1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:01.880
 but if one wants to look up a great reference on this,

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:06.880
 the reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al, 2017,

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:09.160
 describes in here, I'm quoting,

1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:10.000
 so this is a direct quote,

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:10.980
 the present findings are in line

1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:11.980
 with those of a recent study,

1:07:11.980 --> 1:07:14.020
 which also found faster reaction times

1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:16.300
 in participants that listen to binaural beats of 40 Hertz.

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:20.260
 And you can find many examples of this in the literature

1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:23.300
 where binaural beats of about 40 Hertz

1:07:23.300 --> 1:07:25.480
 were exactly 40 Hertz in some cases,

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:29.020
 somehow brought the brain into a state

1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:31.460
 that made it optimal for learning, for memory,

1:07:31.460 --> 1:07:32.780
 and for certain types of recall,

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:35.380
 including verbal recall, math learning, et cetera.

1:07:35.380 --> 1:07:38.340
 So for those of you that are interested in binaural beats,

1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:40.320
 there are a number of free apps out there.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:41.660
 I'm not going to recommend any in particular.

1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:45.020
 You just have to search for one that you happen to like.

1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:46.380
 One thing that you will find

1:07:46.380 --> 1:07:51.060
 is that many of those apps super impose binaural beats

1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:53.980
 onto raindrops or ocean sounds,

1:07:53.980 --> 1:07:56.080
 or rather they superimpose ocean sounds

1:07:56.080 --> 1:07:57.980
 and raindrops onto the binaural beats.

1:07:57.980 --> 1:08:00.200
 That does not appear to be as effective

1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:02.500
 as pure binaural beats.

1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:03.780
 There has been an exploration

1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:06.200
 of lower frequency binaural beats.

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:08.140
 So for instance, seven Hertz,

1:08:08.140 --> 1:08:10.960
 which is theta binaural beats done for 30 minutes

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:14.060
 with an overlay of rain sound or rain sounds only,

1:08:14.060 --> 1:08:15.440
 that's been analyzed.

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:16.580
 And believe it or not,

1:08:16.580 --> 1:08:18.460
 that showed immediate recall memory

1:08:18.460 --> 1:08:20.740
 was significantly decreased, okay?

1:08:20.740 --> 1:08:23.540
 So that's a negative effect of binaural beats on memory.

1:08:23.540 --> 1:08:24.900
 So the idea that binaural beats

1:08:24.900 --> 1:08:28.500
 are just great for us across the board, I think is wrong.

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:31.560
 It does appear that the higher frequency binaural beats

1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:33.420
 as one moves up toward 40 Hertz

1:08:33.420 --> 1:08:35.600
 are going to be the most beneficial.

1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:37.540
 There are instances in which,

1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:40.000
 for instance, 15 Hertz binaural beats

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.420
 increased response accuracy

1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:44.460
 on a spatial verbal memory task.

1:08:44.460 --> 1:08:46.380
 This is a complicated working memory task.

1:08:46.380 --> 1:08:48.020
 Working memory is the kind of memory

1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:49.420
 of remembering a phone number.

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:53.700
 So if I say, for instance, 4932931,

1:08:53.700 --> 1:08:55.540
 and you have to remember that number,

1:08:55.540 --> 1:08:58.380
 keeping it online is what we call your working memory.

1:08:58.380 --> 1:08:59.400
 It's likely that you would forget

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:00.900
 that two or three days later.

1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:02.720
 You can get improvements in working memory

1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:05.220
 with 15 Hertz binaural beats.

1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:07.260
 Whereas the other control conditions,

1:09:07.260 --> 1:09:09.020
 five Hertz and 10 Hertz binaural beats

1:09:09.020 --> 1:09:12.260
 all decreased accuracy of working memory.

1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:14.140
 However, when I look at the literature

1:09:14.140 --> 1:09:16.980
 and I examined a number of different studies,

1:09:16.980 --> 1:09:19.260
 what I always seem to come back to

1:09:19.260 --> 1:09:23.180
 was that 40 Hertz or so plus or minus five Hertz

1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:26.640
 seem to be optimal for generating improvements

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.780
 in cognition, in math performance,

1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:31.820
 and even in various types of memory recall

1:09:31.820 --> 1:09:33.340
 and even in musical performance.

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:34.540
 You might wonder, well, how can people do

1:09:34.540 --> 1:09:36.980
 musical performance that are listening to binaural beats?

1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:38.820
 Here's another surprise.

1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:40.700
 Many of the studies that I looked at

1:09:40.700 --> 1:09:42.820
 didn't have people listening to binaural beats

1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:44.260
 while they were doing the tasks,

1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:46.420
 the memory task or the music learning, et cetera.

1:09:46.420 --> 1:09:48.820
 They would do it beforehand for 30 minutes.

1:09:48.820 --> 1:09:51.220
 There were instances in which people were listening

1:09:51.220 --> 1:09:53.100
 to binaural beats during the task.

1:09:53.100 --> 1:09:54.860
 But if you decide to employ binaural beats,

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:58.100
 I recommend this 40 Hertz as a great place to start.

1:09:58.100 --> 1:10:00.740
 I don't recommend doing it for all of your work bouts.

1:10:00.740 --> 1:10:02.780
 I think there's a good reason to believe

1:10:02.780 --> 1:10:04.560
 that you could attenuate to it.

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:06.780
 But if you are going to try it, you might try it both ways.

1:10:06.780 --> 1:10:08.420
 You might try listening to binaural beats

1:10:08.420 --> 1:10:10.700
 for about 30 minutes while doing something else,

1:10:10.700 --> 1:10:12.820
 and then maybe eating lunch or something of that sort

1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:15.660
 or taking a walk and then going into the work bout.

1:10:15.660 --> 1:10:18.540
 Because remember, the moment that you start listening

1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:19.380
 to these binaural beats,

1:10:19.380 --> 1:10:20.860
 the brain doesn't immediately switch

1:10:20.860 --> 1:10:23.580
 into a particular pattern of oscillation or brainwaves.

1:10:23.580 --> 1:10:24.420
 It takes some time.

1:10:24.420 --> 1:10:26.760
 Neural circuits, again, take time to engage.

1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:29.320
 The only neural circuits that are going to engage instantly

1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:31.700
 are going to be the ones that are of a sort of reflexive

1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:33.980
 sort, like you step on a sharp object

1:10:33.980 --> 1:10:35.600
 and you have to retract your limb,

1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:38.900
 or you suddenly are stressed by a distressing text message,

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:42.280
 or you're suddenly delighted about a delightful text message.

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:44.580
 But when it comes to shifting your whole brain state

1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:47.760
 toward optimizing work, it takes a little bit of time.

1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.340
 So again, 40 hertz binaural beats, many, many apps,

1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:53.220
 many YouTube scripts out there,

1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:55.260
 probably other resources for binaural beats,

1:10:55.260 --> 1:10:57.040
 hopefully zero cost so you can access those

1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:59.920
 without any need to shell out any money.

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:01.580
 If you find one that you particularly like,

1:11:01.580 --> 1:11:02.800
 maybe put it in the comment section

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.020
 so other people can find it,

1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:06.100
 YouTube would be the best place to do that.

1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:08.360
 Feel free to put a link or just a description.

1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:10.020
 That would be wonderful.

1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:13.220
 And again, you don't need to listen to binaural beats

1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:14.920
 at the exact same time that you're doing the work,

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.920
 although that could also enhance your productivity.

1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:19.420
 Some of you out there might be craving

1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:21.860
 a little bit more mechanism by which binaural beats

1:11:21.860 --> 1:11:25.360
 can influence things like focus or reduced reaction time.

1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:27.380
 This has actually been explored.

1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:31.060
 This 40 hertz binaural beats pattern

1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:34.340
 seems to have an effect on what's called striatal dopamine.

1:11:34.340 --> 1:11:36.260
 We have dopamine as a neuromodulator,

1:11:36.260 --> 1:11:38.540
 of course, involved in many things in motivation.

1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:40.980
 It's actually involved in adaptation to light in the retina,

1:11:40.980 --> 1:11:42.820
 something that most people don't know,

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:44.640
 but it's involved in movement,

1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.020
 which is why people with Parkinson's

1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:48.020
 who have a depletion of dopamine neurons

1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:50.100
 actually have movement deficits and so on.

1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:52.540
 But striatal dopamine is closely related

1:11:52.540 --> 1:11:54.980
 to motivation and focus.

1:11:54.980 --> 1:11:58.580
 And 40 hertz binaural beats

1:11:58.580 --> 1:12:01.380
 appears to increase striatal dopamine release.

1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:03.380
 And this has actually been measured indirectly

1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:06.060
 by what we call spontaneous blink rate.

1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:08.000
 I've been accused on various Instagram posts

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.060
 and even on this podcast of being a non-blinker,

1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:14.140
 let's call it, or a minimal blinker.

1:12:14.140 --> 1:12:16.120
 And as an important aside,

1:12:17.020 --> 1:12:18.700
 there is no evidence whatsoever

1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:20.140
 that people that don't blink very much

1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:21.800
 are sociopaths or lie.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:25.260
 Also, you will hear that people who blink a lot

1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:27.220
 are sociopaths and are lying.

1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:28.580
 There is absolutely no evidence

1:12:28.580 --> 1:12:30.180
 that blink frequency correlates

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:32.680
 with anything except alertness.

1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:35.820
 Now, longer blinks are associated with less alertness.

1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:38.000
 As we get tired, we tend to blink longer and longer

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.180
 until we take the long blink that is sleep.

1:12:41.180 --> 1:12:42.760
 I guess the long blink would be death,

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:46.340
 but the long-ish blink would be sleep.

1:12:46.340 --> 1:12:48.800
 But it turns out that the more firing

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:52.480
 of striatal dopamine neurons that's occurring,

1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:54.180
 the more frequently we blink.

1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:57.180
 And so it is associated with a resetting

1:12:57.180 --> 1:12:58.140
 of our visual window.

1:12:58.140 --> 1:12:59.340
 That's what happens when we blink.

1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:00.580
 And there's a whole relationship

1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:02.180
 between blinking and time perception

1:13:02.180 --> 1:13:04.460
 that we covered in the episode on time perception.

1:13:04.460 --> 1:13:07.300
 But here's the bottom line for sake of this discussion.

1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:08.660
 40 hertz binaural beats

1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:11.000
 appears to increase spontaneous blink rates

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.620
 because it increases dopamine transmission

1:13:13.620 --> 1:13:16.240
 in the brainstem and in the striatum,

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:18.100
 in several locations, in fact.

1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:20.740
 And so the way in which these binaural beats

1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:22.300
 set a rhythm in the brain,

1:13:22.300 --> 1:13:24.080
 recruits dopamine release,

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:26.420
 that dopamine release leads to heightened levels

1:13:26.420 --> 1:13:28.300
 of motivation and focus.

1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:29.720
 Why motivation and focus?

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.900
 Well, dopamine is actually the substrate

1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:33.300
 by which epinephrine is made.

1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:34.420
 Dopamine, the molecule,

1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:37.020
 is actually converted into epinephrine, adrenaline.

1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:38.960
 And they work together like close cousins,

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.280
 dopamine and epinephrine,

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:42.340
 in order to put us on a path of movement,

1:13:42.340 --> 1:13:45.680
 or if we are doing work of mental movement toward a goal.

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:48.100
 So that's a little bit of mechanistic meat

1:13:48.100 --> 1:13:50.220
 to explain at least part of the reason

1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:53.740
 why 40 hertz binaural beats can enhance our focus,

1:13:53.740 --> 1:13:54.880
 reduce our reaction times,

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:56.740
 and improve indeed learning and memory.

1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:59.060
 Next, I'd like to talk about the role of movement

1:13:59.060 --> 1:14:01.080
 in optimizing our workspace.

1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:04.660
 And whether or not standing, sitting, lying down,

1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:07.240
 treadmilling, or even, believe it or not, cycling,

1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:10.540
 can enhance our work output and performance.

1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:11.380
 Before we do that,

1:14:11.380 --> 1:14:14.540
 I want to touch on two aspects of optimizing workspace

1:14:14.540 --> 1:14:16.740
 that will come up at some point

1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:19.020
 in your work or school life.

1:14:19.020 --> 1:14:21.660
 Alas, there isn't a lot of science around this,

1:14:21.660 --> 1:14:23.780
 but I think they are worth mentioning.

1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:25.860
 And I think I can offer a little bit of advice

1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:27.320
 in terms of how to navigate these

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:29.300
 in a way that would be beneficial to you.

1:14:29.300 --> 1:14:31.780
 The first one is interruptions.

1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:34.140
 You know, if you go online and you ask about, you know,

1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:35.660
 how to avoid interruptions, people will say,

1:14:35.660 --> 1:14:38.060
 okay, well, if you have kids at home, or even if you don't,

1:14:38.060 --> 1:14:40.320
 or at work, you'll have a light, like a recording,

1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:42.860
 like recording is on, we're busy now,

1:14:42.860 --> 1:14:44.640
 or have a sign on the door that says,

1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:46.360
 bother only in the case of emergency,

1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:49.380
 or fine to knock, or don't knock at all.

1:14:49.380 --> 1:14:51.220
 I've used a different policy throughout the years.

1:14:51.220 --> 1:14:53.820
 I am somebody who works pretty hard

1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:55.940
 to control my time and focus.

1:14:55.940 --> 1:14:58.500
 But of course, as a laboratory director,

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:01.620
 I have people coming by and who want to talk about things.

1:15:01.620 --> 1:15:03.980
 And of course, we have phones and we have computers

1:15:03.980 --> 1:15:06.080
 and people's opportunity to reach us.

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:08.820
 Interruptions really are deadly

1:15:08.820 --> 1:15:11.340
 to our ability to generate focus.

1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:14.540
 And it's not just about the distraction that occurs

1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:16.460
 of say a minute or two minutes or five minutes

1:15:16.460 --> 1:15:17.420
 when we were interrupted.

1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:19.580
 It's also about the additional time

1:15:19.580 --> 1:15:22.740
 to get those brain circuits re-engaged to a mode of focus.

1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:24.520
 So it's really kind of a double whammy.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.740
 Now, none of us, including myself,

1:15:26.740 --> 1:15:30.100
 want to be harsh or cruel or shut off from the world.

1:15:30.100 --> 1:15:32.720
 And oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insights

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:34.300
 and people are providing support

1:15:34.300 --> 1:15:37.060
 and very useful things that are essential to my workday

1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:40.420
 and presumably to your workday and school day as well.

1:15:40.420 --> 1:15:42.620
 But there's a simple method that I learned

1:15:42.620 --> 1:15:45.900
 from my graduate advisor that works very, very well.

1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:47.580
 Again, no peer-reviewed data to support it.

1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:49.400
 This is just my experience.

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:52.500
 But this is somebody who had immense powers of focus,

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:54.720
 had a very, very demanding life, a long commute,

1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:58.380
 two children, extensive laboratory, et cetera.

1:15:58.380 --> 1:16:01.680
 And what she would do was if I came by and asked a question

1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:03.860
 or if anyone came by and asked a question,

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:05.540
 she would acknowledge their presence

1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:07.460
 but would not shift her body toward them.

1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:09.980
 So she purposely did not position her computer

1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:13.220
 facing the door, which I think is a deadly,

1:16:13.220 --> 1:16:15.460
 or I should say deadly to focus way

1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:17.500
 of positioning your workspace.

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:18.900
 So her computer was facing the wall.

1:16:18.900 --> 1:16:21.340
 The door was perpendicular to that.

1:16:21.340 --> 1:16:22.980
 And I would come by and I say, I have a question.

1:16:22.980 --> 1:16:24.000
 And she would say, yes.

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.200
 So she would acknowledge my presence,

1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:27.700
 but she wouldn't actually orient her body toward me,

1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:29.260
 which told me that this conversation

1:16:29.260 --> 1:16:30.520
 was not going to last very long.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.660
 And no matter how long I stood there or what I asked,

1:16:32.660 --> 1:16:34.020
 she would never orient toward me,

1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:36.700
 which generally kept these conversations very, very short.

1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:37.960
 We had other designated meetings

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:39.540
 where we would be face-to-face.

1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:42.600
 The other approach, which I confess colleagues of mine

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.460
 have used before, not necessarily at Stanford,

1:16:45.460 --> 1:16:48.800
 but elsewhere is to simply say no

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:51.420
 to everything that somebody requests or comes by.

1:16:51.420 --> 1:16:52.880
 So if someone would knock on the door,

1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:55.080
 they would just shout no through the door.

1:16:55.080 --> 1:16:56.980
 Or if someone would say, can I bother you for a second?

1:16:56.980 --> 1:16:57.920
 They would say no.

1:16:57.920 --> 1:16:59.500
 Or if someone would say, I have something I want to tell you,

1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:01.200
 they would just say no, and they would just continue

1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:02.520
 doing this until the person went away.

1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:04.060
 That was actually very effective.

1:17:04.060 --> 1:17:06.920
 These were some of the most productive people I know,

1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:09.680
 not always the kindest people,

1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:11.320
 but some of them were very kind.

1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:12.440
 The other approach that I've seen,

1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:15.840
 and actually this is an approach that was used

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.720
 by someone who has been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:22.320
 someone who's immensely productive, was that he,

1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:26.160
 so I'm constraining who this might be by saying he,

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:29.160
 he actually, despite having the option

1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:30.240
 to have a very large office,

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.320
 would place himself in a workspace

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:35.900
 that was literally a coat closet,

1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:39.260
 cleared out with a desk, small lamp, completely dark.

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:42.680
 So this violates everything that I've talked about before

1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:45.020
 or prior to this, everything about high ceilings,

1:17:45.020 --> 1:17:47.840
 bright light, et cetera, and would work, still works,

1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:51.600
 underneath a desk lamp in a completely dark closet,

1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:53.040
 minimal ventilation.

1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:55.220
 This is my definition of hell,

1:17:55.220 --> 1:17:58.080
 and yet is one of the most productive people on the planet.

1:17:58.080 --> 1:17:59.720
 Also very, very hard to find.

1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:01.280
 I actually know where his closet is.

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:03.380
 It turns out he has several of them that he migrates from

1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:05.380
 in order to avoid distractions.

1:18:05.380 --> 1:18:07.000
 So I mentioned these as kind of extremes.

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.660
 I think that most of us exist on the other extreme,

1:18:09.660 --> 1:18:10.500
 and that's why I mention it,

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:13.760
 which is that most of us like some social engagement

1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:17.420
 and kind of welcome or at least set our work environment

1:18:17.420 --> 1:18:19.120
 in a way that welcomes interruption,

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.180
 and we have to be very, very careful about this.

1:18:21.180 --> 1:18:22.880
 Now in the digital realm,

1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:25.920
 I already mentioned a few of the things that we can do

1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:28.760
 as practical tools to limit interruptions.

1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.320
 One is to use the program freedom.

1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:32.640
 The other would be to simply turn off the wifi.

1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:34.760
 If you do need to be online and navigating,

1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.280
 you're doing research of any kind,

1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:37.680
 that's not going to be possible.

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:39.100
 Turning off one's phone.

1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:41.920
 I've at times put my phone on airplane mode.

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:43.720
 If that didn't work, I've locked it in a safe.

1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:45.460
 I've done that. I've left it in the car outside.

1:18:45.460 --> 1:18:47.360
 It all depends on one's levels of self-discipline,

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:49.960
 which as you probably know from your own experience

1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:51.360
 tends to kind of wax and wane.

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:54.240
 Sometimes we are better at avoiding these distractions

1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:55.080
 than others.

1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:57.160
 If you find yourself in a place where it's very hard

1:18:57.160 --> 1:18:59.240
 to reduce those distractions,

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.640
 you may need to go to more elaborate lengths.

1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:04.800
 I will say that a graduate student in my lab

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:06.840
 who was immensely productive and focused

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:09.160
 had the habit of coming in each day.

1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:11.000
 She would take her phone,

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000
 I don't know if she turned it on, off or not,

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.860
 and she would just place it in a door, excuse me,

1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:18.720
 in a drawer, and would then go start doing experiments.

1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:20.760
 We do experiments all day, attend courses,

1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:22.960
 engage in discussions avidly with the rest of us,

1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:25.200
 and then would take her phone out at the end of the day

1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:26.040
 and leave.

1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:29.840
 And I don't think that behavior was not correlated

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:31.680
 with her immense productivity.

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:35.800
 I think the ability to untether ourselves from the phone

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.300
 is going to be the way in which many of us

1:19:38.300 --> 1:19:41.400
 are either going to succeed or fail in our various pursuits.

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:44.440
 I'm somebody who engages with the phone on a regular basis

1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:46.340
 throughout the day for various reasons,

1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:48.480
 but I do try and have large swaths of the day

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:50.080
 in which it's either on airplane mode

1:19:50.080 --> 1:19:52.280
 or it's completely physically separated from me.

1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:53.880
 And when I mean large swaths,

1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:56.800
 I might do every other hour with the phone on airplane mode

1:19:56.800 --> 1:19:58.760
 or even a two or three hour bout

1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:01.680
 where I just am simply not engaged with the phone at all.

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:03.040
 So is it better to sit

1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:05.360
 or is it better to stand when doing work,

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:07.840
 at least as it relates to focus and productivity?

1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:10.100
 And the answer is both.

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.800
 There've been a number of systematic studies

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:15.640
 exploring what are called sit-stand desks.

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:18.800
 So these are desks that can be set to a height

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:22.240
 that makes standing the best practice,

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:24.300
 and then they can be lowered to a height

1:20:24.300 --> 1:20:26.480
 that makes sitting the best practice

1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:28.520
 or the easiest practice, I should say.

1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:33.440
 And it turns out that just sitting is terrible for us, okay?

1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:36.080
 And there's an enormous number of studies out there

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:39.860
 that point to the fact that people who sit for five or six

1:20:39.860 --> 1:20:43.320
 or seven hours a day doing work have all sorts of issues

1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:46.640
 related to sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers,

1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:49.240
 the number of cardiovascular effects, even digestion.

1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:52.460
 There may even actually be some almost pressure effects

1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:54.360
 on the pelvic floor and things of that sort,

1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:56.780
 depending on the chairs that one uses,

1:20:56.780 --> 1:21:01.160
 but that people who stand are in a slightly better situation

1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:04.160
 where many of those health metrics improve,

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:06.140
 but that people that do a combination of sitting

1:21:06.140 --> 1:21:07.920
 and standing at the same desk throughout the day

1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:09.800
 or move from one desk to another

1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:11.600
 if they don't have a combination sit-stand desk,

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.640
 that that's going to be best.

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:16.100
 The good news is it's very easy to convert a sit desk

1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:16.940
 into a stand desk.

1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:17.980
 You can just stack some boxes.

1:21:17.980 --> 1:21:19.880
 I've done this at times or stack books.

1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:21.400
 There are also some pedestals and things

1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:24.020
 that you can purchase if that's your preference

1:21:24.020 --> 1:21:25.800
 in order to set your computer at a particular height.

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:28.280
 And of course there are desks that have motors

1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:29.420
 and there are ones that have cranks

1:21:29.420 --> 1:21:31.020
 and there are all sorts of variations,

1:21:31.020 --> 1:21:33.440
 both in terms of the types and whether or not

1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:36.160
 they have motors, as well as the cost to these things.

1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:38.640
 So they can go from very low costs like placing boxes

1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:41.440
 or books to create a standing desk

1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:43.680
 to very high cost in some cases.

1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:46.440
 Now, what's interesting if you look

1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:49.080
 at the scientific literature is that people

1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:53.540
 who decreased their sitting time by about half each day.

1:21:53.540 --> 1:21:55.680
 So they took, let's say they were working

1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:59.480
 for seven hours a day, three and a half hours of that day,

1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:00.600
 they decide to stand.

1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:02.080
 And it's not even clear that it matters

1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:04.160
 that they do all those three hours in one bout

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:06.960
 or they divide that up into shorter bouts of a half an hour

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:08.200
 and then sit for half an hour, et cetera,

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:09.680
 alternating back and forth,

1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:12.600
 showed incredibly significant effects

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.840
 on reduced neck and shoulder pain,

1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:16.260
 increase in subjective health,

1:22:16.260 --> 1:22:18.760
 vitality in work-related environments,

1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:20.080
 and perhaps most importantly,

1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:21.660
 for sake of today's discussion,

1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:25.400
 improvement in cognitive conditioning

1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:27.960
 and the ability to embrace new tasks

1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:29.840
 and cognitive performance.

1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:32.000
 There are several studies that if one wanted to explore,

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.200
 they could explore this in more detail.

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.520
 I'll put a link to this as well.

1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:38.700
 The article that I'm referring to is called

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:41.760
 Effect of Workplace Sit-Stand Desk Intervention

1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:43.440
 on Health and Productivity.

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:46.140
 And I like this paper because many of the papers out there

1:22:46.140 --> 1:22:49.680
 focus on the effects of sit-stand desks on health

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:52.420
 in trying to get people to burn more calories,

1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.120
 improve their posture, relieve neck pain,

1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:56.920
 slumped over, et cetera, but not on productivity.

1:22:56.920 --> 1:22:58.340
 And this particular paper focuses

1:22:58.340 --> 1:23:00.460
 also on the metrics of productivity.

1:23:00.460 --> 1:23:01.440
 It has its own study

1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:03.660
 and also references a number of important studies.

1:23:03.660 --> 1:23:04.880
 What does this mean for you and me?

1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:06.900
 Well, I've long used a standing desk

1:23:06.900 --> 1:23:08.540
 or some variation thereof.

1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:10.200
 What this means is that we should probably spend

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:12.360
 about half of our work time standing

1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:14.420
 and about half of it sitting,

1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:16.800
 but not all sitting or not all standing.

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.000
 If you had to do all one or the other,

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.240
 standing is going to be better than sitting.

1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:23.040
 What happens if we just stand?

1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:26.400
 Well, that can also generate some postural issues

1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:28.800
 in terms of stabilization and fatigue.

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:31.840
 I have a good friend who's in the movement

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:34.760
 and physical rehabilitation and physiology space.

1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:36.600
 His name is Kelly Starrett.

1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:39.200
 He's very impressive in all those domains.

1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.500
 And he always says, you know,

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:41.840
 we weren't designed to sit all day,

1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:43.660
 but we also weren't designed to stand all day.

1:23:43.660 --> 1:23:44.500
 And I think that's true.

1:23:44.500 --> 1:23:46.080
 If we were to look back at our species

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:48.980
 over tens or hundreds or thousands of years,

1:23:48.980 --> 1:23:51.140
 we would find that indeed we did sit down.

1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:52.020
 We did lie down.

1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:54.100
 It wasn't that we were standing all day long.

1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:57.400
 That said, most everybody, at least in the US,

1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:01.360
 is not getting sufficient cardiovascular exercise

1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:02.640
 or movement throughout the day.

1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:04.160
 And standing at one's desk

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:06.600
 can improve some of those health metrics

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:08.560
 and again can improve productivity,

1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:10.920
 probably because of those postural effects

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:12.360
 that I talked about earlier,

1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:13.620
 that when we lie down,

1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:16.880
 there tends to be less alertness in our brainstem,

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.360
 if you will, there's less activation

1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:20.440
 of those brainstem circuits involved in alertness.

1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:22.760
 And indeed the circuits that involve

1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:26.120
 kind of a calming effect on the body get activated.

1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:30.220
 And as we become upright, standing or sitting,

1:24:30.220 --> 1:24:31.740
 but especially standing,

1:24:31.740 --> 1:24:34.500
 then those brainstem circuits for alertness kick on,

1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:37.480
 which are going to make it easier to remain focused.

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:40.080
 If you are going to start standing for half of your work

1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:42.440
 time, you will notice that it takes a few days to adapt.

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.880
 You'll notice a lot of shifting from side to side.

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:46.280
 Definitely want to wear comfortable shoes.

1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:48.080
 Some people do this on a wooden floor.

1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:50.240
 Other people feel uncomfortable unless they're on carpet.

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:51.640
 You have to figure out what works for you,

1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:53.700
 but it can take a little bit of time to adapt.

1:24:53.700 --> 1:24:56.840
 I have to say after now about 10 years of working

1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:58.500
 at a sit-stand desk,

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.760
 I find I can't sit for too long before I want to stand.

1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:02.440
 And my standing bouts can be anywhere

1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:04.620
 from 30 minutes to two hours,

1:25:04.620 --> 1:25:06.000
 although two hours would be a little bit long.

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:07.880
 And then I catch myself kind of leaning on the desk

1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:08.920
 off to the side.

1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:10.580
 So again, the idea is to stand,

1:25:10.580 --> 1:25:13.040
 but not be leaning on the desk.

1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:14.440
 Obviously, if you're typing or you're writing,

1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:15.700
 there'll be some leaning involved,

1:25:15.700 --> 1:25:17.760
 but that's what the literature support.

1:25:18.740 --> 1:25:20.920
 There is also a literature on whether or not

1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:23.740
 physical movement under your desk, meaning treadmilling,

1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:26.680
 or in fact, there are now bicycles

1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:28.260
 that allow people to pedal.

1:25:28.260 --> 1:25:30.020
 It's kind of a unicycle like thing,

1:25:30.020 --> 1:25:32.300
 although not a unicycle under the desk,

1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:34.840
 can be beneficial for workplace performance.

1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:36.920
 So let's take a look at what those data say.

1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:39.280
 The study that I'm referring to has a first author,

1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:44.040
 Frodsham, F-R-O-D-S-H-A-M, Frodsham et al.

1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:48.280
 This is a research article published in PLOS One.

1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:50.120
 And the title of the article is,

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:52.480
 Does Type of Active Workstation Matter?

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:54.520
 A Randomized Comparison of Cognitive

1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:57.060
 and Typing Performance Between Rest, Cycling,

1:25:57.060 --> 1:25:59.120
 and Treadmill Active Workstations.

1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:00.380
 It's amazing that people do this science.

1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:01.720
 I think it's great.

1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:04.080
 Where else would we get peer reviewed data

1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:05.920
 on these types of questions?

1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:09.000
 First things first, there were no significant differences

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.120
 between cycling or treadmill workstations

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:13.380
 on any cognitive or typing outcomes.

1:26:13.380 --> 1:26:16.260
 So it does not seem to matter whether or not

1:26:16.260 --> 1:26:18.280
 people are treadmilling under the desk.

1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:20.160
 So these would be stationary treadmills.

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:22.800
 It's like a little conveyor that people are walking on,

1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:23.760
 sometimes very slowly.

1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:25.520
 I'm guessing some people walk more quickly.

1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:27.560
 The New Yorkers probably treadmill quicker.

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:30.120
 The Californians probably treadmill a little slower.

1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:33.220
 I'm a Californian, so I can make that quote unquote joke.

1:26:33.220 --> 1:26:35.860
 But nonetheless, there were no significant differences

1:26:35.860 --> 1:26:38.200
 between that and a cycling station where people are sitting

1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:41.400
 and pedaling as they type away or as they work

1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:43.260
 or as they're on phone calls, et cetera.

1:26:43.260 --> 1:26:44.380
 So it really doesn't seem to matter.

1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:47.380
 So if you're going to embrace these active workstations,

1:26:47.380 --> 1:26:51.240
 as they're called, just decide what you would prefer to use.

1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:53.280
 It doesn't seem to matter in terms of outcomes.

1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:58.280
 Now, this study involved looking at 137 young adults.

1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:03.280
 They had multiple sessions where they at first completed

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:06.360
 cognitive and typing tests.

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:07.960
 These tests have different names and you're welcome

1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:11.160
 to look those up if you like, as well as flanker tasks.

1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:13.840
 So these are tasks of attention and things of that sort.

1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:17.280
 And then they either engaged in treadmill or cycling.

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.040
 And then there was a comparison and the statistics were run.

1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:24.060
 And basically what they found was there was a statistically

1:27:24.060 --> 1:27:27.480
 significant improvement in attention and cognitive control

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.560
 scores during any kind of active session,

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.400
 as opposed to just a mere seated session.

1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:36.260
 Okay, so they compared seated to cycling to treadmilling.

1:27:36.260 --> 1:27:40.600
 However, verbal memory scores actually got worse

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:41.680
 during active sessions.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:43.280
 So I'll repeat that.

1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:47.800
 Treadmilling or the cycling workstations improved attention

1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:50.560
 and cognitive control scores as compared to people

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:52.600
 that were just seated and working.

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:55.520
 However, verbal memory scores got worse

1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:56.600
 during the active sessions.

1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:58.520
 And again, just to repeat, there was no difference

1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:00.800
 between cycling and treadmill workstations.

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:01.720
 So this is interesting.

1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:04.600
 I suggest that as the authors say that active workstations,

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.640
 whether walking or cycling are not only useful

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:10.480
 to improve caloric output and physical activity,

1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:14.160
 circulation, and so on, but particularly when completing

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:16.520
 tasks like cognitive tasks or tasks that require focus

1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:18.800
 that do not require verbal memory recall.

1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:23.040
 Now, why verbal memory recall was negatively impacted,

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:24.040
 we don't know.

1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:25.920
 Could be because people were breathing a little bit harder.

1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:27.760
 It could be that there's something about walking

1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:30.860
 and talking that seems incompatible in the nervous system,

1:28:30.860 --> 1:28:31.960
 although I'm not aware of that.

1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:33.240
 I know a number of people who can walk

1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:34.920
 and talk at the same time.

1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:38.680
 But if you are going to explore these treadmills

1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:40.440
 or you're going to explore these cycling stations,

1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:43.080
 you probably wouldn't want to do that for highly verbal

1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:46.360
 work, maybe more for mathematical work or for analytic work

1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:48.840
 or even creative work, but anything that involves

1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:51.840
 very precise or detailed verbal recall,

1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:56.100
 sitting or standing seems to be the better option.

1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:59.700
 And if you're wondering why cycling or treadmilling

1:28:59.700 --> 1:29:02.920
 would enhance various aspects of cognition,

1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:04.560
 we can speculate.

1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:06.020
 I've talked before about this,

1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:09.060
 but anytime we are generating forward movement

1:29:09.060 --> 1:29:11.780
 through our own actions, our own efforts,

1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:15.140
 typically if we are outside, we're not on a treadmill

1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:17.100
 or we're on a bicycle or we're running

1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:19.340
 or even on a motorcycle or in a car,

1:29:19.340 --> 1:29:20.980
 we have what's called optic flow.

1:29:20.980 --> 1:29:25.100
 And that optic flow is known to quiet certain areas

1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:27.080
 of the brain that are associated with vigilance

1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:27.920
 and indeed fear.

1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:30.660
 This is the basis of things like EMDR,

1:29:30.660 --> 1:29:33.300
 eye movement to sensitization reprocessing.

1:29:33.300 --> 1:29:37.220
 However, the mere act of engaging what are called

1:29:37.220 --> 1:29:38.640
 our central pattern generators,

1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:41.400
 the neurons in our brainstem and in our spinal cord

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:45.140
 that engage repetitive movements also can reduce

1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:46.660
 some of the areas of the brain that are associated

1:29:46.660 --> 1:29:47.820
 with anxiety and vigilance.

1:29:47.820 --> 1:29:49.560
 So one, pure speculation,

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:52.620
 but nonetheless grounded speculation would be that

1:29:52.620 --> 1:29:55.760
 treadmilling or cycling at a desk would reduce anxiety

1:29:55.760 --> 1:29:57.740
 that would allow performance to improve.

1:29:57.740 --> 1:30:00.740
 The other, what I think is more likely explanation

1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:02.860
 is that anytime we are in ambulation,

1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:05.460
 we recruit the release of neuromodulators

1:30:05.460 --> 1:30:08.100
 like epinephrine, dopamine, and things of that sort

1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:10.660
 that further increase overall levels of alertness.

1:30:10.660 --> 1:30:12.260
 I think that's the more likely explanation

1:30:12.260 --> 1:30:14.620
 because it's hard to imagine how just a reduction

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:18.380
 in anxiety could lead to these improvements in cognition

1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:19.540
 in a direct way.

1:30:19.540 --> 1:30:22.300
 Whereas the subjects in the study I just mentioned

1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:26.360
 on average experienced an increase in cognitive performance

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:27.940
 merely by movement, okay?

1:30:27.940 --> 1:30:30.380
 And this does not include any optic flow

1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:31.980
 because it's stationary, the treadmill

1:30:31.980 --> 1:30:33.280
 or the cycle is stationary.

1:30:33.280 --> 1:30:35.340
 And so we can rule out that optic flow.

1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:39.180
 And that points to the idea that when we are in movement,

1:30:39.180 --> 1:30:41.260
 we recruit neuromodulators associated

1:30:41.260 --> 1:30:43.180
 with the so-called reticular activating system,

1:30:43.180 --> 1:30:45.940
 the striatal system and so forth that would place the brain

1:30:45.940 --> 1:30:48.420
 into some pattern, we don't know,

1:30:48.420 --> 1:30:50.140
 we only can speculate some pattern,

1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:52.740
 perhaps it's gamma waves or some other wave pattern

1:30:52.740 --> 1:30:55.560
 that would engage heightened levels of focus and attention.

1:30:55.560 --> 1:30:59.500
 Nonetheless, treadmilling, cycling at a desk

1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:00.940
 does improve cognition.

1:31:00.940 --> 1:31:03.580
 So we've been discussing workspace optimization

1:31:03.580 --> 1:31:06.460
 with the understanding that you're not always going to work

1:31:06.460 --> 1:31:09.060
 in the same place every day.

1:31:09.060 --> 1:31:11.060
 What I've tried to do is give you a set

1:31:11.060 --> 1:31:13.700
 of high potency tools that can improve your focus

1:31:13.700 --> 1:31:16.680
 and cognition and to place that within a framework

1:31:16.680 --> 1:31:18.180
 for particular kinds of work.

1:31:18.180 --> 1:31:20.300
 Let's just review some of the basic elements

1:31:20.300 --> 1:31:21.660
 of what we've covered today.

1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:24.240
 First of all, in the first part of your day,

1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:26.340
 that zero to nine hours after waking,

1:31:26.340 --> 1:31:28.460
 you want bright lights, especially overhead lights,

1:31:28.460 --> 1:31:29.800
 as bright as you can keep them

1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:31.300
 without feeling uncomfortable

1:31:31.300 --> 1:31:33.780
 or certainly not without feeling any pain in your eyes

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:35.280
 or elsewhere in your body.

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:39.860
 Bright lights make for the maximum state of alertness.

1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:42.480
 In addition, try and place whatever it is

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:44.460
 that you're focusing on directly in front of you,

1:31:44.460 --> 1:31:45.920
 but not have it extend too far out

1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:47.640
 to either side of your eyes.

1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:50.320
 Try and generate a fairly restricted visual window,

1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:51.460
 as we call it.

1:31:51.460 --> 1:31:54.860
 And if you can, try and place whatever it is

1:31:54.860 --> 1:31:57.560
 you're focusing on at least at nose level or above.

1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:00.940
 It might take some engineering or some ingenuity

1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:02.860
 and creativity in order to figure out how to do that,

1:32:02.860 --> 1:32:04.980
 but that's going to be most beneficial.

1:32:04.980 --> 1:32:07.620
 Try and avoid reclining, try and avoid sitting,

1:32:07.620 --> 1:32:11.020
 try and stand for at least half of your workday.

1:32:11.020 --> 1:32:11.940
 That's a good goal.

1:32:11.940 --> 1:32:14.480
 And it may take some time to work up to that goal.

1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:17.660
 In addition, if you're going to use sound as a stimulus

1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:19.980
 for increasing focus and alertness,

1:32:19.980 --> 1:32:22.220
 try and avoid exposure to white noise,

1:32:22.220 --> 1:32:25.380
 pink noise or brown noise for extended periods of time

1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:26.940
 for more than an hour or so.

1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:29.900
 That might actually be damaging to the auditory system.

1:32:29.900 --> 1:32:32.340
 And at the very least is kind of stressful,

1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:33.460
 even though you might not notice it,

1:32:33.460 --> 1:32:35.540
 it's kind of a background level of anxiety and stress

1:32:35.540 --> 1:32:37.180
 that is not going to serve you well.

1:32:37.180 --> 1:32:39.120
 Rather, if you're going to pursue

1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:41.200
 particular types of sound frequencies,

1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:45.140
 consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats, not monaural beats,

1:32:45.140 --> 1:32:47.540
 but 40 Hertz binaural beats

1:32:47.540 --> 1:32:49.860
 done during a particular work bout

1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:53.160
 or for 30 minutes prior to that work bout.

1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:55.580
 I would not rely on binaural beats all the time.

1:32:55.580 --> 1:32:57.020
 Every day I think that could cause them

1:32:57.020 --> 1:32:58.460
 to lose their potency

1:32:58.460 --> 1:33:00.780
 just because of the way the auditory system attenuates.

1:33:00.780 --> 1:33:02.500
 And actually you've experienced that attenuation.

1:33:02.500 --> 1:33:04.240
 The mere fact that you can go into an environment

1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:05.820
 where there's an air conditioner blowing,

1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.000
 blowing, blowing, and then it stops

1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:08.100
 and you feel that relaxation,

1:33:08.100 --> 1:33:10.420
 but you weren't thinking about the air conditioner before,

1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:11.780
 tells you that your auditory system

1:33:11.780 --> 1:33:13.180
 had kind of attenuated to it

1:33:13.180 --> 1:33:15.320
 and yet it was still impacting your system.

1:33:15.320 --> 1:33:18.620
 You were sensing it, we would say, but not perceiving it.

1:33:19.540 --> 1:33:20.600
 There are other things that you can do

1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:23.480
 to improve your workspace optimization,

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.860
 such as standing for half the day, as I mentioned before,

1:33:26.860 --> 1:33:28.780
 but if you're interested in this

1:33:28.780 --> 1:33:30.340
 or you feel like it suits you,

1:33:30.340 --> 1:33:32.220
 to treadmill, find a stationary treadmill

1:33:32.220 --> 1:33:33.520
 that you can walk on.

1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:35.100
 I've never tried this before.

1:33:35.100 --> 1:33:36.260
 Maybe after this episode,

1:33:36.260 --> 1:33:38.260
 given what I've read in the peer-reviewed research,

1:33:38.260 --> 1:33:39.820
 and it's pretty compelling,

1:33:39.820 --> 1:33:42.200
 that treadmilling seems like an interesting way

1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:44.780
 to increase alertness and cognitive performance.

1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:47.700
 I'm not sure that I would do the cycling method

1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:49.580
 because I can't imagine just cycling and typing

1:33:49.580 --> 1:33:50.420
 at the same time.

1:33:50.420 --> 1:33:52.320
 That sort of feels like I actually can do

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:54.900
 the rub your tummy, top of your head kind of thing,

1:33:54.900 --> 1:33:56.700
 but it still feels like a little bit

1:33:56.700 --> 1:34:01.020
 of a sort of a cognitive motor collision for me

1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:03.140
 for whatever reason, but that's just my bias.

1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:04.420
 I do know how to ride a bicycle,

1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:06.500
 but anyway, you pick your preference.

1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:07.780
 Some other things that you could do

1:34:07.780 --> 1:34:10.620
 in order to improve your workplace performance

1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:13.060
 would be to consider the cathedral effect.

1:34:13.060 --> 1:34:15.220
 If you're going to do analytic work

1:34:15.220 --> 1:34:17.180
 for any part of the day, phase one or phase two,

1:34:17.180 --> 1:34:20.060
 as I described them, but really in any time of day,

1:34:20.060 --> 1:34:21.420
 that detailed analytic work

1:34:21.420 --> 1:34:23.260
 for which there is a correct answer,

1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:25.340
 learning scales of music, learning mathematics,

1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:27.180
 trying to figure out the solution to a problem

1:34:27.180 --> 1:34:28.700
 where there is indeed a solution.

1:34:28.700 --> 1:34:31.060
 It could be an interpersonal problem as well.

1:34:31.060 --> 1:34:32.580
 Then try and get into an environment

1:34:32.580 --> 1:34:34.100
 with a relatively low ceiling.

1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:36.060
 If you don't have access to a low ceiling environment,

1:34:36.060 --> 1:34:39.040
 you might consider using a brimmed hat or even a hoodie,

1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:41.000
 or even just facing down,

1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:43.700
 or even putting your hand above your eyes,

1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:46.420
 as you will, at the level of your eyebrows.

1:34:46.420 --> 1:34:47.620
 In other words, lower the ceiling.

1:34:47.620 --> 1:34:49.620
 That's the basis of the cathedral effects

1:34:49.620 --> 1:34:52.400
 on analytic performance.

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:55.820
 In contrast, if you're interested in doing brainstorming,

1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:59.100
 creative work, you're writing new things,

1:34:59.100 --> 1:35:01.300
 you're creating new things of any kind, artwork,

1:35:01.300 --> 1:35:02.820
 consider getting into a high ceiling

1:35:02.820 --> 1:35:04.900
 or no ceiling environment,

1:35:04.900 --> 1:35:06.420
 or if you're wearing a brimmed hat

1:35:06.420 --> 1:35:08.920
 or you're wearing a hoodie, maybe peel that back.

1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:12.020
 Again, the data within the peer-reviewed literature

1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.900
 are there to support these sorts of practices.

1:35:14.900 --> 1:35:16.700
 And if you'd like to start layering these protocols,

1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:18.420
 by all means, please do that.

1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:20.900
 There's no reason why you couldn't do one

1:35:20.900 --> 1:35:22.940
 or just two of these protocols.

1:35:22.940 --> 1:35:24.340
 There's no reason why, for instance,

1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:25.860
 you couldn't use binaural beats

1:35:25.860 --> 1:35:28.200
 and try and get into a low ceiling environment

1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:30.740
 to do detailed work a couple of times a week,

1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:32.980
 but you could also employ all of these.

1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:34.700
 Now, of course, there are an enormous number

1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:36.140
 of other things that you can do

1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:38.580
 to improve work performance and productivity.

1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:40.560
 And I've talked about those in previous episodes,

1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:42.740
 in particular, in the episode on focus

1:35:42.740 --> 1:35:44.580
 and the episode on motivation.

1:35:44.580 --> 1:35:46.540
 There are supplements you can take

1:35:46.540 --> 1:35:48.220
 that can increase dopamine, for instance.

1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:51.620
 There are tools that you can use to increase your focus.

1:35:51.620 --> 1:35:53.940
 For instance, focusing your visual attention

1:35:53.940 --> 1:35:56.700
 on one location for 30 to 60 seconds

1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:58.740
 prior to entering a focused work bout.

1:35:58.740 --> 1:36:00.560
 This has been shown again and again

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.200
 through work from Emily Balsettis at NYU.

1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:05.660
 In the episode on focus, I cited a number of studies

1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:07.480
 where this has actually been tested and deployed

1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:11.060
 in various schools, having kids do a focus task

1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:12.660
 where they look at a particular visual target

1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:15.140
 for 30 to 60 seconds, then doing some mathematics

1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:17.140
 and seeing pretty impressive improvement

1:36:17.140 --> 1:36:18.340
 in focus and attention,

1:36:18.340 --> 1:36:20.420
 even in people that have attention deficit

1:36:20.420 --> 1:36:22.780
 hyperactivity disorder and so on.

1:36:22.780 --> 1:36:26.260
 So there's no reason why you can't and shouldn't combine

1:36:26.260 --> 1:36:29.460
 the sort of practical workspace optimization solutions

1:36:29.460 --> 1:36:30.720
 that we talked about today

1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:33.540
 with the kind of neural optimization solutions

1:36:33.540 --> 1:36:35.500
 that we talked about in the episode on focus

1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:38.680
 and the episode on ADHD and the episode on motivation.

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:40.340
 By all means, layer those together.

1:36:40.340 --> 1:36:43.380
 That's how you're going to achieve the optimal focus bouts.

1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:44.620
 That's how you're going to achieve

1:36:44.620 --> 1:36:47.540
 the optimal creativity bouts.

1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:48.940
 I do want to acknowledge again,

1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:51.520
 the fact that I realize people are showing up

1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:54.020
 to this challenge of workspace optimization

1:36:54.020 --> 1:36:55.900
 with different budgets, with different constraints.

1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:57.080
 Some people have kids at homes.

1:36:57.080 --> 1:36:58.500
 There are a lot of interruptions.

1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:01.420
 Some people do not, nonetheless,

1:37:01.420 --> 1:37:03.780
 I hope that the information I was able to provide today

1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:05.520
 will allow you to make subtle

1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:07.620
 or maybe even drastic rearrangements

1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.200
 in your workspace environment.

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:11.340
 There's one other point related to that

1:37:11.340 --> 1:37:14.060
 that I did not cover and that I'd like to cover just briefly

1:37:14.060 --> 1:37:16.120
 which is that there's nothing to say

1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:17.540
 that you have to always work

1:37:17.540 --> 1:37:19.860
 in the same location all the time.

1:37:19.860 --> 1:37:21.700
 You can move from house to cafe.

1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:24.380
 If that works for you, you can move from office to home.

1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:27.360
 You can also move from different locations within your home.

1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.020
 I have a brief anecdote about this.

1:37:29.020 --> 1:37:31.180
 I used to attend a lot of scientific meetings

1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:33.260
 when a lot of scientific meetings were in person

1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:35.660
 and there were always a few individuals

1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:36.980
 that seemed to stay engaged

1:37:36.980 --> 1:37:39.180
 throughout these very long meetings.

1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:40.760
 We're talking seven, eight hour days,

1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:41.980
 sometimes evening sessions,

1:37:41.980 --> 1:37:44.860
 and sometimes these meetings would go on

1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:47.500
 for four or five or even six days.

1:37:47.500 --> 1:37:48.460
 These were long meetings

1:37:48.460 --> 1:37:50.820
 and the quality of talks varied tremendously.

1:37:50.820 --> 1:37:52.560
 And I always noticed the individuals

1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:54.920
 that managed to stay engaged and awake

1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:57.380
 for the entire meeting.

1:37:57.380 --> 1:37:59.500
 And I noticed that people

1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:02.060
 that could maintain high levels of alertness

1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:04.820
 in this one conference room had a habit

1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:07.460
 of moving to a different seat after each session,

1:38:07.460 --> 1:38:09.180
 sometimes even between talks.

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:10.540
 And I actually discussed this

1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:11.860
 with one of my colleagues who was doing this.

1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:12.840
 I said, is this conscious?

1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:14.700
 Are you always moving from place to place?

1:38:14.700 --> 1:38:16.420
 And they said, yeah, if I just stay in one place

1:38:16.420 --> 1:38:18.420
 and I just look from this one particular visual angle

1:38:18.420 --> 1:38:20.620
 at the screen, I find after one or two talks,

1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:23.140
 regardless of how interesting the talks are,

1:38:23.140 --> 1:38:25.940
 that I start to kind of drift, my mind isn't as engaged

1:38:25.940 --> 1:38:27.460
 and indeed sometimes can fall asleep.

1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:30.540
 And so I started this practice of moving from space to space

1:38:30.540 --> 1:38:32.500
 or I should say seat to seat within an auditorium

1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:33.580
 and it works quite well.

1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:35.880
 And I think it works quite well because again,

1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:39.060
 of the relationship between our visual system driving

1:38:39.060 --> 1:38:41.300
 the majority of our cognition, right?

1:38:41.300 --> 1:38:42.780
 Our visual system drives our thinking

1:38:42.780 --> 1:38:45.920
 and that novel visual environments

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:47.020
 are going to lend themselves

1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:49.300
 to heightened levels of alertness.

1:38:49.300 --> 1:38:51.540
 You don't want things to be so novel and scary

1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:53.740
 or threatening or anxiety provoking or loud

1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:55.740
 that they draw your attention away from your work.

1:38:55.740 --> 1:38:58.540
 But I think this is part of the reason why turning on music

1:38:58.540 --> 1:39:02.340
 or moving to an office or a cafe or an outdoor environment

1:39:02.340 --> 1:39:04.500
 from an indoor environment or vice versa,

1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:06.160
 maybe even within a single day,

1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:08.980
 can bring about more heightened levels of productivity.

1:39:08.980 --> 1:39:11.340
 I'd also like to acknowledge that what I covered today

1:39:11.340 --> 1:39:14.960
 is most certainly not exhaustive for all the types

1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:18.300
 of workspace optimization tools that one could create.

1:39:18.300 --> 1:39:21.580
 For that reason, I'd love for you to suggest

1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:23.360
 any of your workspace optimization tools

1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:24.500
 that you found useful.

1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:26.540
 Please put those in the comment section on YouTube.

1:39:26.540 --> 1:39:27.380
 That would be the best place

1:39:27.380 --> 1:39:28.940
 then other people can see them.

1:39:28.940 --> 1:39:32.180
 Also read through those and perhaps in a future episode,

1:39:32.180 --> 1:39:33.980
 I'll call about some of the ones that I've tried

1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:35.820
 on the basis of your suggestions.

1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:38.100

 We also have an Instagram and a Twitter account.

1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:21.380
 It's Huberman Lab and there I teach neuroscience

1:40:21.380 --> 1:40:23.300
 and neuroscience related tools.

1:40:23.300 --> 1:40:26.400
 Oftentimes that information and those tools overlap

1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:27.540
 with themes on the podcast,

1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:30.060
 but sometimes they are distinct from themes

1:40:30.060 --> 1:40:31.500
 and topics covered on the podcast.

1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:34.260
 So please follow us on Instagram and Twitter.

1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:36.340
 This episode, we didn't talk too much about supplements,

1:40:36.340 --> 1:40:39.140
 but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:41.020
 we talk about supplementation.

1:40:41.020 --> 1:40:43.100
 And while supplementation isn't required

1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:44.180
 or great for everybody,

1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:47.660
 some people do derive tremendous benefit from supplements.

1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:50.180
 We talk about supplements for focus, for sleep,

1:40:50.180 --> 1:40:52.620
 for creativity, all sorts of things.

1:40:52.620 --> 1:40:54.180
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:40:54.180 --> 1:40:57.260
 you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com

1:40:57.260 --> 1:40:59.420
 slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:01.060
 There you can see the supplements that I take,

1:41:01.060 --> 1:41:03.140
 you can get 20% off those supplements.

1:41:03.140 --> 1:41:05.340
 And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

1:41:05.340 --> 1:41:08.300
 through that portal, Thorne, thorne.com

1:41:08.300 --> 1:41:10.300
 slash the letter U slash Huberman,

1:41:10.300 --> 1:41:13.140
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:41:13.140 --> 1:41:14.300
 that Thorne makes.

1:41:14.300 --> 1:41:15.960
 The reason we partnered with Thorne

1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:17.580
 is because one of the major issues

1:41:17.580 --> 1:41:18.780
 in the supplement industry

1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:20.620
 is that many of the supplements out there

1:41:20.620 --> 1:41:23.500
 don't contain sufficient quantity

1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:25.680
 or they contain too much of a given supplement

1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:28.980
 and the quality of the ingredients can vary tremendously.

1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:31.520
 With Thorne supplements, there's immense stringency

1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:33.420
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients

1:41:33.420 --> 1:41:35.820
 and the precision of the amounts of those ingredients

1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:37.780
 that they include in each product.

1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:40.460
 Once again, thank you for joining me for this discussion

1:41:40.460 --> 1:41:42.600
 about the science and peer-reviewed literature

1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:44.240
 on workspace optimization.

1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:46.540
 I hope some, if not all of the tools

1:41:46.540 --> 1:41:47.940
 will be beneficial for you.

1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:50.680
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:41:50.680 --> 1:42:15.680
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
