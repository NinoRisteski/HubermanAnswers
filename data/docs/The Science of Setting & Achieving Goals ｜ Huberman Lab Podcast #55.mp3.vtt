00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.420 --> 00:10.380
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.380 --> 00:12.940
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.940 --> 00:14.780
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.860
 Today, we're talking all about goals

00:16.860 --> 00:20.820
 and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.300
 There's a tremendous amount of information on the internet

00:23.300 --> 00:26.120
 and in books and so forth about how to set goals

00:26.120 --> 00:28.380
 and assess your progress towards goals

00:28.380 --> 00:31.220
 and update your goals and so forth.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.740
 In fact, there are so many programs out there

00:33.740 --> 00:35.720
 that include so many different acronyms

00:35.720 --> 00:37.660
 that it can be a little bit overwhelming.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.580
 Today's conversation about goals

00:39.580 --> 00:41.260
 is going to be quite a bit different.

00:41.260 --> 00:43.700
 Indeed, we are going to talk about setting goals.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.320
 We are also going to talk about

00:45.320 --> 00:47.660
 how to assess progress towards goals,

00:47.660 --> 00:51.060
 and we are going to talk about goal execution.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.380
 However, we're going to do all of this

00:53.380 --> 00:55.800
 in the context of neuroscience,

00:55.800 --> 00:59.900
 because it turns out that there are not hundreds

00:59.900 --> 01:03.380
 or dozens or even several neural circuits in your brain

01:03.380 --> 01:06.900
 that control goal setting and movement toward your goals.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.160
 There is one.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.620
 And while it includes many different brain areas,

01:10.620 --> 01:13.100
 that one circuit is the same circuit

01:13.100 --> 01:16.420
 that's responsible for pursuing all goals.

01:16.420 --> 01:19.140
 And it relates to some very basic neurochemical mechanisms

01:19.140 --> 01:20.400
 that are understood.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.300
 So while there's a wealth of information out there

01:22.300 --> 01:24.860
 about goals and goal setting and goal achievement

01:24.860 --> 01:27.840
 and so forth, there's comparatively little information

01:27.840 --> 01:29.500
 that's been available to the public

01:29.500 --> 01:32.940
 about the neuroscience of goal setting and goal achievement.

01:32.940 --> 01:35.060
 So that's what we're going to focus on today.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.940
 I promise that we're going to get into the neuroscience.

01:37.940 --> 01:40.020
 We're going to touch on a little bit of the psychology

01:40.020 --> 01:42.100
 and how the neuroscience relates to what's known

01:42.100 --> 01:43.840
 in the psychology literature.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.940
 And we are going to establish several,

01:45.940 --> 01:48.060
 in fact, four specific protocols

01:48.060 --> 01:51.020
 that you can use for goal setting, goal assessment,

01:51.020 --> 01:53.700
 and goal execution in an ongoing basis,

01:53.700 --> 01:56.600
 regardless of what your personal goals happen to be.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.660
 Before we dive into our conversation about goals

01:58.660 --> 02:00.580
 and goal setting and goal achievement,

02:00.580 --> 02:02.780
 I'd like to highlight some recent scientific findings

02:02.780 --> 02:05.100
 that I think are going to be interesting and actionable

02:05.100 --> 02:07.220
 for many of you out there.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.980
 In earlier podcasts, we talked about neuroplasticity,

02:09.980 --> 02:11.700
 which is the brain's ability to change

02:11.700 --> 02:12.820
 in response to experience.

02:12.820 --> 02:16.540
 In fact, neuroplasticity underlies all forms of learning,

02:16.540 --> 02:19.140
 whether or not it's language learning or learning music

02:19.140 --> 02:21.900
 or math or a physical skill,

02:21.900 --> 02:25.140
 all forms of learning involve the reorganization

02:25.140 --> 02:26.940
 of connections in the nervous system,

02:26.940 --> 02:28.700
 the brain and spinal cord and body.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.340
 One of the key principles of neuroplasticity

02:32.340 --> 02:34.900
 is this notion of making errors

02:34.900 --> 02:37.420
 as a good thing toward neuroplasticity.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.020
 It's a little bit counterintuitive,

02:39.020 --> 02:41.360
 but what the scientific literature tells us

02:41.360 --> 02:43.420
 is that whenever we're trying to learn something new,

02:43.420 --> 02:46.380
 if we make an error, we know it feels frustrating,

02:46.380 --> 02:48.220
 but that state of frustration

02:48.220 --> 02:51.060
 actually cues up particular brain areas

02:51.060 --> 02:54.000
 to be more alert so that on subsequent attempts

02:54.000 --> 02:56.400
 to learn that thing, we have a heightened level of focus

02:56.400 --> 02:58.980
 and a higher probability of learning the new skill,

02:58.980 --> 03:00.980
 regardless of what that skill is.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.340
 And I've talked about this before in various episodes

03:03.340 --> 03:07.980
 as encouraging people to embrace errors or pursue errors,

03:07.980 --> 03:11.240
 not as their own end goal, but errors as an entry point

03:11.240 --> 03:13.020
 for making the brain more plastic.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.640
 And if you think about it, it really makes sense.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.780
 Why would the brain change at all

03:15.780 --> 03:18.060
 if it's performing everything perfectly?

03:18.060 --> 03:21.100
 When you make errors, well, in the immediate seconds

03:21.100 --> 03:22.820
 and minutes after those errors,

03:22.820 --> 03:25.440
 you are in a better position to learn.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.220
 A common question I get, however,

03:27.220 --> 03:29.740
 is what should be the rate of errors,

03:29.740 --> 03:31.100
 which is really just a way of saying

03:31.100 --> 03:34.780
 how hard should the given task be

03:34.780 --> 03:37.140
 that you're trying to learn or perform?

03:37.140 --> 03:38.540
 And it turns out there's an answer.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.300
 There's a recent paper that was published

03:40.300 --> 03:42.680
 in a great journal, Nature Communications.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.740
 This is a paper, a last author, Jonathan Cohen,

03:45.740 --> 03:50.740
 and the paper is entitled the 85% Rule for Optimal Learning.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.140
 This paper we will make available by a link

03:53.140 --> 03:54.980
 in the show note captions.

03:54.980 --> 03:56.980
 But basically what this paper shows

03:56.980 --> 03:59.720
 is that when trying to learn something new,

03:59.720 --> 04:01.020
 you want to make the difficulty

04:01.020 --> 04:01.940
 of what you're trying to learn

04:01.940 --> 04:05.980
 such that you're getting things right about 85% of the time,

04:05.980 --> 04:08.900
 that you're making errors about 15% of the time.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.780
 And the reason I like this paper

04:10.780 --> 04:12.860
 is it really points specifically

04:12.860 --> 04:14.740
 to some protocols that we can implement

04:14.740 --> 04:17.700
 because people always say, okay, you want to set a high goal.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.920
 You want to try and achieve something that's really lofty,

04:19.920 --> 04:21.660
 but you don't want to make the goal so lofty

04:21.660 --> 04:23.640
 that you don't make any progress at all.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.980
 Other people say you really want to start

04:24.980 --> 04:26.400
 with really small goals

04:26.400 --> 04:28.060
 and make things very, very incremental,

04:28.060 --> 04:30.980
 only set out to do things that you know you can accomplish

04:30.980 --> 04:33.140
 and that will feed back on your self-esteem

04:33.140 --> 04:34.700
 and all these positive feedback loops.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.260
 And then, you know, layer by layer, layer by layer,

04:37.260 --> 04:38.900
 you'll eventually get where you want to go.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.400
 Well, it turns out that neither is true.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.220
 You need to set the level of difficulty

04:42.220 --> 04:45.180
 such that you're making errors about 15% of the time.

04:45.180 --> 04:48.080
 And I want to emphasize about 15% of the time

04:48.080 --> 04:51.660
 because there's no way to configure protocols

04:51.660 --> 04:53.860
 for sport or language or math or anything else

04:53.860 --> 04:56.980
 where you're going to have exactly 15% of errors.

04:56.980 --> 05:00.420
 So anyway, this paper, the 85% rule for optimal learning,

05:00.420 --> 05:01.820
 again, we will supply the link,

05:01.820 --> 05:02.820
 but it really points to the idea

05:02.820 --> 05:05.380
 of making things pretty hard,

05:05.380 --> 05:07.600
 but not so hard that you're failing every attempt

05:07.600 --> 05:09.100
 or even half of the attempts.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.420
 Failing about 15% of the time seems optimal for learning.

05:13.420 --> 05:14.840
 Hopefully, that information will be useful

05:14.840 --> 05:17.180
 to any of you that are trying to learn something.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.140
 Hopefully, it will also be useful to those of you

05:19.140 --> 05:21.980
 that are teaching kids or other adults.

05:21.980 --> 05:22.820
 If you're teaching,

05:22.820 --> 05:26.060
 keep in mind that you want to keep the students reaching

05:26.060 --> 05:29.020
 for higher and higher levels of proficiency

05:29.020 --> 05:30.820
 in whatever that is that you're teaching

05:30.820 --> 05:33.820
 and that 15% of the time they should be failing.

05:33.820 --> 05:35.860
 If it gets to 20%, that's probably okay.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.780
 If they start failing about half the time,

05:37.780 --> 05:39.940
 then probably what they're trying to learn

05:39.940 --> 05:42.260
 is too difficult for them at that point.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.740
 Now, of course, this is going to be controlled

05:43.740 --> 05:45.300
 by all sorts of external factors,

05:45.300 --> 05:47.300
 like whether or not they slept well the night before,

05:47.300 --> 05:48.860
 whether or not you slept well the night before

05:48.860 --> 05:51.060
 and you're being clear in your instructions

05:51.060 --> 05:52.340
 to them, et cetera.

05:52.340 --> 05:55.020
 But I think the 15% rule, as we may call it,

05:55.020 --> 05:56.820
 is a good metric to aim for

05:56.820 --> 05:59.100
 and it can serve both students and teachers.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.140
 In other words, it can serve both those teaching

06:01.140 --> 06:03.100
 and those that are learning.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.500
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

06:05.500 --> 06:08.260
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.140
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

06:10.140 --> 06:12.560
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

06:12.560 --> 06:15.180
 and science-related tools to the general public.

06:15.180 --> 06:16.180
 In keeping with that theme,

06:16.180 --> 06:18.900
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.940
 Our first sponsor is Element.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.580
 Element is an electrolyte drink mixed

06:22.580 --> 06:24.780
 with everything you need and nothing you don't.

06:24.780 --> 06:26.140
 That means lots of salt,

06:26.140 --> 06:28.700
 some other electrolytes, and no sugar.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.420
 As I've mentioned before on this podcast

06:30.420 --> 06:33.460
 and in various interviews, I'm a big fan of salt.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.400
 I sort of discovered this a few years ago

06:35.400 --> 06:36.560
 when Science Magazine,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.900
 one of the preeminent magazines out there

06:38.900 --> 06:40.740
 that publishes research on science,

06:40.740 --> 06:42.460
 but also news articles about science,

06:42.460 --> 06:44.900
 talked about the myth of salt research.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.060
 It turns out that, contrary to what I had believed,

06:48.060 --> 06:50.720
 which was that salt is going to cause hypertension

06:50.720 --> 06:52.320
 or that salt is really bad for us,

06:52.320 --> 06:54.700
 there's an innate need for salt in our system.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.380
 And indeed, if you dive into the textbooks on salt balance,

06:57.380 --> 07:00.020
 we have entire biological systems or kidneys

07:00.020 --> 07:02.140
 and fluid management, et cetera,

07:02.140 --> 07:04.380
 that are involved in making sure that we get enough salt.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.200
 In fact, neurons, nerve cells, function

07:07.200 --> 07:10.940
 because salt, sodium, actually enters those cells quickly

07:10.940 --> 07:13.380
 and that's what causes them to fire action potentials,

07:13.380 --> 07:17.780
 the common syllable or language of neurons, if you will.

07:17.780 --> 07:21.180
 When we are low in sodium, our neurons don't work as well.

07:21.180 --> 07:22.100
 And a few years later,

07:22.100 --> 07:24.580
 I had the experience of feeling kind of shaky

07:24.580 --> 07:25.980
 and I thought I had blood sugar issues.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.100
 I went and got my blood sugar checked and it was fine.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.680
 And a physician made the recommendation

07:29.680 --> 07:31.700
 that I actually upped my salt intake.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.420
 My intake wasn't particularly low, I didn't think,

07:34.420 --> 07:37.260
 but I quickly found was that if I consumed enough salt,

07:37.260 --> 07:38.340
 usually I would do this in the form

07:38.340 --> 07:40.780
 of putting a little pinch of salt into some water,

07:40.780 --> 07:42.340
 adding a little lemon juice or something like that,

07:42.340 --> 07:44.380
 or salting my food a little bit more,

07:44.380 --> 07:48.040
 that I lost any kind of shakiness in my hands,

07:48.040 --> 07:49.900
 that my mental functioning was better,

07:49.900 --> 07:52.140
 my sports performance was better, et cetera.

07:52.140 --> 07:53.860
 So it was really interesting to see that shift

07:53.860 --> 07:56.020
 simply by increasing my salt intake,

07:56.020 --> 07:57.380
 something that's really counterintuitive

07:57.380 --> 07:58.860
 to a lot of what's out there.

07:58.860 --> 08:02.520
 Salt isn't just important for the function of neurons,

08:02.520 --> 08:04.320
 it's important for blood volume

08:04.320 --> 08:06.680
 and working alongside the other electrolytes,

08:06.680 --> 08:08.240
 magnesium and potassium,

08:08.240 --> 08:11.040
 it ensures that cells in our body function properly.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.280
 And I think we're starting to see a shift out there now

08:14.280 --> 08:15.880
 in the perception of what salt

08:15.880 --> 08:17.720
 and the other electrolytes do,

08:17.720 --> 08:19.640
 really seeing magnesium,

08:19.640 --> 08:21.560
 which is one of the electrolytes, potassium,

08:21.560 --> 08:24.760
 and especially salt as not necessarily something to avoid,

08:24.760 --> 08:26.400
 but in fact, something to embrace

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
 provided that they're used properly.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.760
 Element is formulated to help anyone

08:30.760 --> 08:32.520
 reach their electrolyte needs,

08:32.520 --> 08:34.080
 and is particularly well-suited to people

08:34.080 --> 08:36.760
 following a keto, low carb, or paleo diet.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.260
 For people following a low carb diet

08:39.260 --> 08:40.840
 or doing intermittent fasting,

08:40.840 --> 08:42.120
 what many people don't know

08:42.120 --> 08:44.000
 is that carbohydrate holds water,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.180
 it actually brings water into the system,

08:46.180 --> 08:48.360
 and you don't want your system to be low on water,

08:48.360 --> 08:50.580
 that's one form of dehydration.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.440
 Salt holds water as well,

08:52.440 --> 08:55.280
 meaning it keeps the water in your system,

08:55.280 --> 08:57.560
 which is beneficial for brain and body function.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.040
 Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio

09:00.040 --> 09:03.440
 of 1000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,

09:03.440 --> 09:07.120
 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium,

09:07.120 --> 09:10.360
 and they use the very best forms of salt, potassium,

09:10.360 --> 09:12.520
 and magnesium that are out there.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.840
 So the way I use Element is I usually will mix up one packet

09:15.840 --> 09:18.680
 into about 16 to 30 ounces of water in the morning

09:18.680 --> 09:21.400
 and drink that first thing in the morning when I wake up,

09:21.400 --> 09:23.280
 or around breakfast time, doesn't really matter,

09:23.280 --> 09:24.600
 I kind of sip on it through the morning,

09:24.600 --> 09:26.400
 or if I'm real thirsty, I'll drink it all at once.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.860
 And then I always make sure to drink a volume of water

09:29.860 --> 09:32.340
 with an Element packet in it somewhere around my exercise,

09:32.340 --> 09:34.180
 sometimes it's during the exercise,

09:34.180 --> 09:36.240
 if I'm running, I'll wait until afterwards,

09:36.240 --> 09:38.000
 I'll hydrate with it before and after

09:38.000 --> 09:39.220
 if it's a really hot day.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.080
 If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,

09:42.080 --> 09:45.000

09:55.200 --> 09:58.080
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.600
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

09:59.600 --> 10:01.940
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

10:01.940 --> 10:04.440
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

10:04.440 --> 10:06.860
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.520
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

10:08.520 --> 10:10.560
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

10:10.560 --> 10:12.340
 is that it covers all of my foundational

10:12.340 --> 10:14.780
 vitamin mineral probiotic needs.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.520
 We of course need vitamins, we of course need minerals,

10:17.520 --> 10:20.440
 and we do need a healthy gut microbiome,

10:20.440 --> 10:23.720
 and probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.960
 There's now a wealth of quality scientific published data

10:26.960 --> 10:29.800
 showing that the microbiota, meaning the little microbes

10:29.800 --> 10:32.420
 that live in our gut are good for us,

10:32.420 --> 10:34.720
 and our gut when it functions properly

10:34.720 --> 10:35.800
 communicates with our brain,

10:35.800 --> 10:37.380
 and our brain communicates with our gut

10:37.380 --> 10:39.600
 through the so-called gut brain axis,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.860
 and that gut brain axis is vital for things

10:41.860 --> 10:45.460
 like immune system, endocrine system, meaning hormones,

10:45.460 --> 10:47.820
 and for mood and overall brain function.

10:47.820 --> 10:50.080
 With Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins, my minerals,

10:50.080 --> 10:52.360
 and the probiotics I need to support

10:52.360 --> 10:55.160
 a healthy gut microbiome and gut brain axis

10:55.160 --> 10:56.720
 without having to worry about taking

10:56.720 --> 10:58.100
 a bunch of other things.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.200
 In fact, when people ask me what's the one supplement

11:00.200 --> 11:02.440
 I should take that's going to make me feel better,

11:02.440 --> 11:03.840
 I always say Athletic Greens,

11:03.840 --> 11:05.720
 because indeed it makes me feel better,

11:05.720 --> 11:07.280
 and it happens to taste terrific.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.360
 I drink it twice a day typically.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.320
 I'll have one in the morning, I mix it with water

11:11.320 --> 11:13.520
 and a little bit of lemon or lime juice,

11:13.520 --> 11:15.680
 and I'll typically have it again in the afternoon

11:15.680 --> 11:18.160
 or late afternoon, again mixed with water,

11:18.160 --> 11:19.520
 some lemon or lime juice.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.120
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

11:21.120 --> 11:23.960
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

11:23.960 --> 11:25.320
 to claim a special offer.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.800
 They'll give you five free travel packs

11:26.800 --> 11:28.780
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

11:28.780 --> 11:31.820
 while you're in the car or traveling by plane, et cetera.

11:31.820 --> 11:35.580
 Plus, they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.840
 Many of us are deficient in vitamin D3,

11:37.840 --> 11:39.480
 and even for those of us that are getting

11:39.480 --> 11:41.920
 sufficient sunshine, many of us still need

11:41.920 --> 11:43.300
 to supplement with vitamin D3.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.080
 Vitamin D3 is involved in metabolism,

11:45.080 --> 11:48.000
 immune system, brain function, hormones, et cetera.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.380
 It has so many important functions,

11:49.380 --> 11:51.200
 and K2 has been shown to be important

11:51.200 --> 11:52.400
 for a variety of things,

11:52.400 --> 11:54.560
 not the least of which is cardiovascular health.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.240
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

11:57.240 --> 11:58.480
 you can claim a special offer.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.880
 They'll give you five free travel packs

11:59.880 --> 12:02.440
 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.400
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

12:05.400 --> 12:06.980
 to claim the special offer.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.500
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.560
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

12:11.560 --> 12:13.680
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.440
 I spent a lifetime working on the science

12:15.440 --> 12:17.080
 of the visual system, and I can tell you

12:17.080 --> 12:19.160
 that your visual system, everywhere from your eyes

12:19.160 --> 12:22.120
 to your brain, includes a ton of different mechanisms

12:22.120 --> 12:24.040
 so that as you move through different environments,

12:24.040 --> 12:27.080
 you can see things clearly, and even if it's bright out

12:27.080 --> 12:29.280
 or there's shadows or it's really dim outside

12:29.280 --> 12:32.280
 or it's getting dark, that your visual system can try

12:32.280 --> 12:34.640
 and manage to resolve what's out there in the world

12:34.640 --> 12:36.000
 so you can see things clearly.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.840
 Many people need corrective lenses, they need eyeglasses.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.760
 Other people, they need sunglasses as well,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.440
 or just simply need sunglasses,

12:42.440 --> 12:44.880
 because if it's too bright, it's very hard to see things.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.440
 One problem with a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses

12:47.440 --> 12:50.140
 out there, however, is they don't take into account

12:50.140 --> 12:52.560
 the nuanced biology of the visual system.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.760
 You may have experienced this.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.320
 If you ever put on a pair of sunglasses

12:55.320 --> 12:57.860
 that aren't so great, you move from a really bright area

12:57.860 --> 13:00.200
 into a dimly lit area, and you have

13:00.200 --> 13:01.360
 to take the eyeglasses off.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.160
 Your eyes just don't seem to adjust.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.940
 With Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,

13:04.940 --> 13:07.860
 everything they've done to design those glasses and lenses

13:07.860 --> 13:09.760
 is with the science of the visual system in mind,

13:09.760 --> 13:12.040
 so you can move seamlessly from one environment to the next,

13:12.040 --> 13:14.940
 and you always see things with crystal clarity.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.080
 Their sunglasses and eyeglasses are really terrific

13:17.080 --> 13:18.840
 because they can be used for anything.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.920
 They have a terrific aesthetic,

13:19.920 --> 13:22.740
 so you can wear them to work, to dinner, et cetera.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.040
 They look great, and they're also designed

13:25.040 --> 13:26.240
 for athletic performance.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.760
 You can use them while running or while cycling.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.580
 If you get sweaty, they won't slip off your face.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.940
 They're extremely lightweight.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.200
 In fact, I often forget that they're even on my face.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.720
 I wear readers at night, and sometimes when I drive,

13:36.720 --> 13:39.160
 and I wear sunglasses when it's really bright outside

13:39.160 --> 13:40.680
 and I need sunglasses.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.940
 If you want to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,

13:42.940 --> 13:46.280

13:52.640 --> 13:54.940
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.720
 Let's talk about the science, and in particular,

13:56.720 --> 14:01.120
 the biology and neuroscience of setting and achieving goals.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.360
 Setting and achieving goals

14:02.360 --> 14:05.440
 is not a uniquely human endeavor.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.600
 Other animals set and attempt to achieve goals.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.120
 A honeybee attempts to collect honey

14:10.120 --> 14:11.840
 and bring it back to the hive.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.920
 A herbivore will go out and forage for plants,

14:14.920 --> 14:17.540
 and will also have a need to reproduce

14:17.540 --> 14:18.600
 at some point in its life.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.800
 So we'll need to find a mate and maybe even raise the young,

14:21.800 --> 14:23.500
 depending on what species that is.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.320
 Predators will have to hunt and kill and eat their food,

14:28.320 --> 14:30.800
 and they have to avoid getting injured in that process.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.840
 They also have to raise young, et cetera.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.520
 So humans are among the other animals,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.040
 or we could say the animals are among us,

14:38.040 --> 14:39.880
 in the need to set goals

14:39.880 --> 14:43.220
 and to make efforts to achieve those goals.

14:43.220 --> 14:46.240
 Now, why do I emphasize this commonality of process?

14:46.240 --> 14:48.800
 The reason I emphasize this commonality of process

14:48.800 --> 14:52.360
 is that it turns out that there is one basic system

14:52.360 --> 14:54.880
 by which all animals, including humans,

14:54.880 --> 14:57.360
 set and attempt to achieve goals.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.900
 Now, humans are unique in our ability

14:59.900 --> 15:03.560
 to orient our mind toward immediate goals,

15:03.560 --> 15:04.960
 moderately termed goals,

15:04.960 --> 15:07.200
 meaning things that might exist on the scale of a week

15:07.200 --> 15:08.720
 or a month or even a year,

15:08.720 --> 15:12.080
 and very long-term goals, like a lifetime goal,

15:12.080 --> 15:13.760
 or a goal that lasts a decade

15:13.760 --> 15:15.760
 or it takes a decade to achieve.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.320
 That's what makes us unique.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.440
 And of course, we don't have access to the mindset

15:19.440 --> 15:22.040
 or the thinking or the emotions of other animals,

15:22.040 --> 15:25.220
 but what we do know is that common neural circuits,

15:25.220 --> 15:28.400
 meaning brain areas that are present in animal species

15:28.400 --> 15:30.040
 and in humans,

15:30.040 --> 15:33.120
 are responsible for orienting our thinking

15:33.120 --> 15:35.800
 and our action toward particular goals.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.800
 Another thing that's really unique about the human brain

15:38.800 --> 15:41.200
 is that we are able to have multiple goals

15:41.200 --> 15:42.720
 interacting at once.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.400
 So for instance, we probably all have fitness goals,

15:46.400 --> 15:48.240
 goals in relationships of different kinds,

15:48.240 --> 15:50.160
 friendships and romantic partnerships,

15:50.160 --> 15:52.300
 as well as maybe scholastic goals.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.480
 Maybe you're in school,

15:53.480 --> 15:54.800
 you're pursuing some kind of learning

15:54.800 --> 15:56.480
 outside of the school environment,

15:57.480 --> 16:00.120
 and or you have business goals or financial goals.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.280
 We are able to have multiple goals at once.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.320
 And other animals do this,

16:03.320 --> 16:04.960
 but humans are unique in the ability

16:04.960 --> 16:06.720
 to juggle a lot of goals.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.220
 And actually one of the major challenges in pursuing goals

16:09.220 --> 16:11.840
 is that goal pursuit often interacts.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.560
 Meaning if you can spend 100% of your time

16:14.560 --> 16:16.120
 chasing one particular goal,

16:16.120 --> 16:17.840
 that might be very effective for that goal,

16:17.840 --> 16:20.780
 but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.160
 You can imagine how this plays out.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.640
 If you're working very, very hard,

16:24.640 --> 16:26.520
 you're solely focused on business,

16:26.520 --> 16:28.040
 often your health will suffer.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.480
 If you're solely focused on your health,

16:29.480 --> 16:30.720
 often other things will suffer.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.680
 And so we have to juggle both our goal setting

16:32.680 --> 16:33.520
 and our goal pursuits.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.820
 And today we're going to talk about

16:34.820 --> 16:36.880
 a number of different ways to work with

16:36.880 --> 16:40.420
 what could very well be called these interleaving goals

16:40.420 --> 16:43.540
 by focusing on a common practice

16:43.540 --> 16:45.620
 or common set of mechanisms

16:45.620 --> 16:48.980
 that are present in all aspects of goal seeking.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.440
 What is that process?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.140
 Well, it turns out it's a neural circuit.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.580
 A neural circuit is simply a collection of brain areas

16:56.580 --> 16:59.240
 that when active in a particular sequence,

16:59.240 --> 17:02.920
 give rise to a particular behavior or perception.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.360
 So for instance, when you feel happy,

17:05.360 --> 17:07.060
 it's not because you have a brain area

17:07.060 --> 17:10.960
 that's the happy brain area that is electrically active,

17:10.960 --> 17:14.200
 rather it's going to involve numerous brain areas

17:14.200 --> 17:16.680
 being active in concert and to different degrees,

17:16.680 --> 17:21.240
 in the same way that the keys on a piano together

17:21.240 --> 17:23.720
 played in the appropriate sequence

17:23.720 --> 17:25.500
 represent a particular song.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.480
 You would never say that one key on the piano

17:27.480 --> 17:30.240
 represents that song, but that key is necessary.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.680
 Similarly in the brain,

17:31.680 --> 17:33.820
 we can say that a brain area might be necessary,

17:33.820 --> 17:37.220
 but not sufficient to give us a particular experience

17:37.220 --> 17:38.920
 or generate a particular behavior.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.240
 So when we think about goal seeking

17:41.240 --> 17:43.720
 and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain,

17:43.720 --> 17:45.920
 it doesn't matter what the goal is,

17:45.920 --> 17:49.240
 it involves a common set of neural circuits.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.540
 And the neural circuit that I'd like to orient us

17:51.540 --> 17:53.840
 toward today, and we will return to it a few times,

17:53.840 --> 17:55.440
 involves learning a couple of names,

17:55.440 --> 17:57.720
 but you don't have to worry so much about memorizing these,

17:57.720 --> 18:00.440
 just more important is to understand the logic

18:00.440 --> 18:01.360
 of how it's put together.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.120
 And I will explain that and make it very clear.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.120
 If you want to learn the names, that's great.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.240
 One of the brain areas is the so-called amygdala.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.640
 The amygdala is most often associated with fear.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.720
 So you might say, wow, how is that involved

18:11.720 --> 18:13.200
 in goal-directed behavior?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.220
 Well, a lot of our goal-directed behavior

18:15.220 --> 18:17.280
 is to avoid punishments,

18:17.280 --> 18:20.320
 including things like embarrassment or financial ruin

18:20.320 --> 18:21.720
 or things of that sort.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.940
 And so the amygdala and some sense of anxiety or fear

18:24.940 --> 18:26.880
 is actually built in to the circuits

18:26.880 --> 18:28.960
 that generate goal seeking

18:28.960 --> 18:31.140
 and our motivation to pursue goals.

18:31.140 --> 18:35.140
 The other areas are the so-called ventral striatum.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.000
 The striatum is part of what's called the basal ganglia.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.120
 The basal ganglia is a neural circuit

18:40.120 --> 18:43.020
 that can very simply be described as a neural circuit

18:43.020 --> 18:44.700
 that helps us generate go,

18:44.700 --> 18:47.980
 meaning the initiation of action and no go,

18:47.980 --> 18:51.480
 the prevention of action type scenarios.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.920
 Let me make that even simpler.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.560
 The ventral striatum is part of this thing

18:54.560 --> 18:55.560
 called the basal ganglia.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.640
 The basal ganglia has sort of two circuits within it.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.740
 One circuit is involved in getting us to do things.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.200
 Like I'm going to get up tomorrow

19:02.200 --> 19:04.760
 and I'm going to run five miles first thing in the morning.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.900
 I don't know if I'm actually going to do that,

19:05.900 --> 19:08.080
 but I'm just using that as an example.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.040
 Another circuit within the basal ganglia

19:10.040 --> 19:11.120
 is a no-go circuit.

19:11.120 --> 19:11.960
 It's the one that says,

19:11.960 --> 19:14.900
 no, I'm not going to go for the second cookie

19:14.900 --> 19:16.080
 or the third cookie.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.980
 I'm not going to eat that.

19:17.980 --> 19:19.600
 And then the go circuit would be the one

19:19.600 --> 19:22.680
 that's responsible for instead eating something else.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.560
 Okay, so we have go and no-go circuits

19:24.560 --> 19:26.120
 within the basal ganglia.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.440
 So we've got amygdala.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.160
 So think of as kind of fear and anxiety and avoidance.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.000
 We've got the basal ganglia,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
 which are for initiating action and preventing action.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.680
 And then there is the so-called cortex.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.440
 The cortex is the outer shell of the brain

19:39.440 --> 19:41.000
 and there are two sub regions of the cortex

19:41.000 --> 19:43.360
 that are involved in goal-directed behavior.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.360
 One is the lateral prefrontal cortex.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.760
 Prefrontal cortex is involved

19:46.760 --> 19:49.680
 in so-called executive function, things like planning,

19:49.680 --> 19:52.000
 thinking about things under different timescales.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
 So not just what we want in the immediate term,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.860
 but what we might want tomorrow or the next day

19:56.860 --> 19:58.160
 and how our actions currently

19:58.160 --> 19:59.880
 are going to relate to the future.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.800
 And the so-called orbitofrontal cortex.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.480
 Orbitofrontal cortex has a large number of functions,

20:05.480 --> 20:08.060
 but one of the key functions of the orbitofrontal cortex,

20:08.060 --> 20:10.740
 it's involved in meshing some emotionality

20:10.740 --> 20:13.600
 with our current state of progress

20:13.600 --> 20:17.580
 and comparing that emotionality to where it might be

20:17.580 --> 20:20.400
 when we are closer to a goal, okay?

20:20.400 --> 20:23.680
 So there are basically four areas, one involved in anxiety,

20:23.680 --> 20:27.380
 one involved in emotion, one involved in planning

20:27.380 --> 20:30.400
 and another involved in this go, no-go action.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.480
 So that's a bunch of detail,

20:31.480 --> 20:34.140
 but if I wanted to make it really simple for everyone,

20:34.140 --> 20:35.960
 I would say there are four areas.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.200
 One is an area associated with anxiety and fear,

20:39.200 --> 20:40.080
 it's the amygdala.

20:40.080 --> 20:43.720
 The second is involved in action and inaction.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.000
 Remember go and no-go, so that's the basal ganglia.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.920
 The other one is involved in planning and thinking

20:50.920 --> 20:52.120
 across different timescales.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.960
 So that's lateral prefrontal cortex.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.960
 And then the fourth one is involved in emotionality,

20:57.960 --> 21:00.520
 where we sit emotionally at present

21:00.520 --> 21:03.040
 compared to where we think we will be emotionally

21:03.040 --> 21:05.280
 when we reach some particular goal,

21:05.280 --> 21:07.680
 and that's the orbitofrontal cortex, okay?

21:07.680 --> 21:09.760
 Again, you don't need to know all those names.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.680
 You don't need to know all the details.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.960
 Just understand that those different elements are involved

21:14.960 --> 21:16.880
 in the decision-making processes

21:16.880 --> 21:18.840
 that lead us toward particular goals

21:18.840 --> 21:22.060
 and have us update our goal seeking, et cetera.

21:22.060 --> 21:26.360
 One key thing is it doesn't matter what the goal is,

21:26.360 --> 21:28.360
 the same circuits are involved.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.860
 So whether or not you're trying to build a company

21:30.860 --> 21:33.120
 that's a billion dollar company that's going to go public,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.800
 or you're thinking about planning a crafts day at home

21:35.800 --> 21:37.440
 with the kids or for yourself,

21:37.440 --> 21:39.320
 or you're thinking about what movie to go see,

21:39.320 --> 21:42.340
 goals, goal seeking and assessing progress towards goals

21:42.340 --> 21:45.320
 all involve the exact same neural circuits.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.440
 It's really remarkable.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.800
 It's also very convenient for our discussion today.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.000
 What's going on in these circuits can basically be boiled

21:53.000 --> 21:55.360
 down to two particular things.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.920
 The first is value information,

21:57.920 --> 21:59.480
 trying to understand whether or not

21:59.480 --> 22:02.600
 something is really worth pursuing or not, okay?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.620
 So placing a value on a particular goal.

22:05.620 --> 22:08.100
 The other component of this neural circuit

22:08.100 --> 22:09.720
 is associated with action,

22:09.720 --> 22:13.240
 which actions to take and which actions not to take

22:13.240 --> 22:16.420
 given the value of a particular goal

22:16.420 --> 22:18.480
 in a given moment's time.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.520
 I want to say that again.

22:19.520 --> 22:23.560
 The other component of the circuit is involved in action,

22:23.560 --> 22:26.420
 whether or not you should act or should not act

22:26.420 --> 22:29.920
 based on your assessment of the value of a goal

22:29.920 --> 22:32.340
 at a particular moment in time.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.960
 And you're going to hear me say

22:33.960 --> 22:35.400
 over and over again in this episode,

22:35.400 --> 22:38.640
 the value information about a goal is so key.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.440
 Here's why.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.720
 There is basically one neurotransmitter

22:42.720 --> 22:45.660
 or rather neuromodulator system

22:45.660 --> 22:49.200
 that governs our goal setting, goal assessment

22:49.200 --> 22:50.120
 and goal pursuit.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.360
 And that is the neuromodulator dopamine.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.920
 Dopamine is the common currency

22:53.920 --> 22:56.440
 by which we assess our progress

22:56.440 --> 22:59.200
 toward particular things of particular value.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.820
 In fact, dopamine is the way that we assess value

23:02.820 --> 23:04.000
 of our pursuits.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.120
 And so as we take a moment and we shift our attention

23:08.120 --> 23:10.240
 to the psychology of goal setting,

23:10.240 --> 23:12.360
 the things that you've probably heard a bit more about,

23:12.360 --> 23:14.200
 about what sorts of goals are good

23:14.200 --> 23:16.900
 and how to set goals and how to categorize goals,

23:16.900 --> 23:19.480
 I want you to think about how dopamine

23:19.480 --> 23:22.760
 could possibly be involved in these different processes.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.200
 And the reason I want you to do this

23:24.200 --> 23:27.320
 is that all of the psychology of goal setting

23:27.320 --> 23:28.820
 and goal pursuit is wonderful

23:28.820 --> 23:31.380
 because it places things into different categories.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.140
 It allows us to parse our thinking

23:33.140 --> 23:36.360
 and organize our thinking, but what's not often seen,

23:36.360 --> 23:38.560
 in fact, I'm not aware of any literature out there,

23:38.560 --> 23:42.220
 scientific or literature in the popular press

23:42.220 --> 23:43.560
 or in popular books,

23:43.560 --> 23:47.480
 is an understanding of how the underlying neurobiology

23:47.480 --> 23:51.520
 can be layered on top of the psychology of goal setting

23:51.520 --> 23:54.780
 to allow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively.

23:54.780 --> 23:55.960
 And that's what we're going to do today.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.600
 We are eventually going to arrive

23:57.600 --> 23:59.520
 at a set of four practices

23:59.520 --> 24:01.400
 that when performed on a regular basis

24:01.400 --> 24:03.800
 will allow you to assess what is the value

24:03.800 --> 24:06.840
 of this next particular action step?

24:06.840 --> 24:11.460
 How worthwhile is it to do behavior A versus behavior B

24:11.460 --> 24:13.620
 in order to achieve a particular goal?

24:13.620 --> 24:15.180
 If any of this is vague now,

24:15.180 --> 24:17.920
 I'm going to make it all very clear for you.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.740
 You're going to come away

24:18.740 --> 24:21.860
 with some very specific lists of takeaways

24:21.860 --> 24:23.560
 that you can put down on paper if you like,

24:23.560 --> 24:26.560
 and that you can use to set goals, assess goals,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.600
 and execute goals more effectively

24:28.600 --> 24:31.660
 using the neuroscience of the circuits I just described

24:31.660 --> 24:34.660
 and an understanding of the neuromodulator dopamine.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.400
 Let's take a look at the psychology

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
 of goal setting and goal pursuit.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.160
 This is an enormous literature,

24:40.160 --> 24:41.680
 meaning there are tens of thousands,

24:41.680 --> 24:44.680
 if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers

24:44.680 --> 24:48.200
 about the topic of goal setting and goal pursuit.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.120
 There's also a lot of information on the internet

24:50.120 --> 24:51.520
 about goal pursuit.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.160
 And in looking over this information,

24:54.160 --> 24:56.500
 one comes to appreciate pretty quickly

24:56.500 --> 24:59.500
 that acronyms are a big thing.

24:59.500 --> 25:03.240
 Acronyms seem to dominate the area of goal setting,

25:03.240 --> 25:05.760
 especially as it relates to things in the business sector,

25:05.760 --> 25:07.400
 but also in the relationship sector.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.940
 Now, acronyms are wonderful.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.840
 They allow us to organize our thinking into lists

25:11.840 --> 25:14.360
 and conceptually, they can be very useful.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.940
 But as I moved through this literature,

25:15.940 --> 25:17.980
 I started to see some redundant themes.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.360
 And so what I've attempted to do

25:19.360 --> 25:21.360
 is distill out the redundant themes

25:21.360 --> 25:23.520
 that regardless of the person teaching

25:23.520 --> 25:25.740
 or the scientific laboratory

25:25.740 --> 25:28.920
 that happened to come up with these acronyms,

25:28.920 --> 25:32.040
 that they boil down to some common features.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.200
 So let's talk about that literature.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.920
 And I think we'll come away with an understanding

25:34.920 --> 25:39.320
 of some basic elements that are common to all goals.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.280
 Now, the modern science or the modern psychological science

25:43.280 --> 25:46.160
 of trying to understand goal setting and pursuit

25:46.160 --> 25:48.200
 actually dates back to the 1930s.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.720
 And we have to be sure that members of our species

25:50.720 --> 25:52.640
 were focused on goal setting and goal pursuit

25:52.640 --> 25:55.220
 long before the scientific literature emerged.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.680
 It just stands to reason that since the human brain

25:57.680 --> 25:59.000
 hasn't evolved that much,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.760
 we don't think in the last 10,000 years

26:01.760 --> 26:04.120
 that people would be thinking about these things.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.800
 They just didn't get them down into papers

26:05.800 --> 26:07.760
 that we could evaluate on PubMed and so forth.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.880
 But now we can, so we can look at those papers.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.480
 And what you find is that acronyms abound

26:12.480 --> 26:14.000
 in the psychology literature

26:14.000 --> 26:15.960
 about goal setting and goal pursuit.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.900
 So for instance, you'll hear about

26:18.900 --> 26:21.800
 the work of Locke and Small, for instance,

26:21.800 --> 26:24.640
 these are the last names of various researchers,

26:24.640 --> 26:26.200
 the so-called ABC method,

26:26.200 --> 26:28.640
 that a goal should be achievable,

26:28.640 --> 26:31.200
 it should be believable, and that the person be committed.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.520
 It's sort of obvious once you hear it, but the ABC method.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.940
 Then people came along and expanded on that.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.880
 They talk about the so-called SMART method,

26:37.880 --> 26:40.640
 SMART being another acronym, that it be specific,

26:40.640 --> 26:43.240
 that the goal be measurable, that the goal be attainable,

26:43.240 --> 26:45.720
 that the goal be realistic, and that it be time-bound,

26:45.720 --> 26:47.720
 meaning that you set a certain period of time

26:47.720 --> 26:50.280
 in which a given goal should be performed.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.120
 And then people come along and modify these.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.920
 This is the way that psychology research is done.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.120
 I'm not laughing at it.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.560
 I'm just chuckling because it seems like the acronyms

26:57.560 --> 26:59.400
 get longer and longer and longer.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.840
 They developed the SMART-er approach,

27:01.840 --> 27:06.560
 adding an ER to the acronym SMART, S-M-A-R-T-E-R.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.520
 They added ethical and rewarding,

27:08.520 --> 27:11.080
 which fortunately are good things, I believe,

27:11.080 --> 27:12.160
 ethical and rewarding.

27:13.820 --> 27:14.800
 What does all this mean?

27:14.800 --> 27:18.460
 Well, what it means is that any kind of goal pursuit,

27:18.460 --> 27:21.420
 any kind of goal setting really has to involve

27:21.420 --> 27:24.720
 a number of different states and neural circuits

27:24.720 --> 27:25.800
 in the brain and body.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.880
 At least that's how I view this literature.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.720
 Why would I do that?

27:28.720 --> 27:31.760
 Well, let's think about the very modern version

27:31.760 --> 27:35.120
 of the kind of acronyms that I talked about a moment ago,

27:35.120 --> 27:38.900
 dating back to the 1930s and extending into the 1990s.

27:38.900 --> 27:42.700
 You can find beautiful talks online from people

27:42.700 --> 27:44.920
 who have worked with some of the biggest companies

27:44.920 --> 27:47.360
 and greatest high performers out there

27:47.360 --> 27:48.880
 to achieve incredible things.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.120
 And they will talk about generating

27:51.120 --> 27:54.480
 a sort of objective mindset for goal setting.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.160
 They'll talk about goals needing to be significant.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.360
 That has to be a big goal, that it has to be concrete.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.100
 So you have to be able to describe what the goal is.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.560
 It has to be action oriented.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.200
 It has to be inspirational, has to be time bound.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.520
 You have to have reasonable, realistic, verifiable measures.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.500
 You have to constantly up the ante.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.860
 If it's starting to sound repetitive,

28:11.860 --> 28:13.480
 it's because it is repetitive.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.500
 There are basically only three or four elements

28:15.500 --> 28:17.660
 to goal setting and goal pursuit.

28:17.660 --> 28:20.680
 Basically an individual or set of individuals

28:20.680 --> 28:23.240
 has to identify a specific thing

28:23.240 --> 28:24.240
 that they're going to attain.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.440
 In some communities, they talk about knowing

28:27.440 --> 28:30.280
 what right looks like, meaning being able

28:30.280 --> 28:31.960
 to define a very specific goal.

28:31.960 --> 28:36.400
 You can't just say, I want to be a champion athlete.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.040
 You have to say what sport

28:38.040 --> 28:40.680
 and you have to understand what the path to that is.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.760
 So any big goal, of course,

28:41.760 --> 28:44.320
 is broken up into a series of smaller goals,

28:44.320 --> 28:45.300
 but the whole thing starts

28:45.300 --> 28:47.120
 with thinking about the end in mind.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.800
 And in a few minutes, we will talk about

28:48.800 --> 28:50.900
 whether or not visualization of the end in mind

28:50.900 --> 28:54.080
 is actually beneficial or detrimental to achieving goals.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.380
 There's actually great neuroscience

28:55.380 --> 28:57.600
 and psychology data on that now.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.520
 So I mentioned all these acronyms,

28:59.520 --> 29:01.600
 not as an attempt to disparage them.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.620
 I think they're wonderful.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.920
 And I mentioned all that psychology literature,

29:04.920 --> 29:06.880
 not in an attempt to disparage it,

29:06.880 --> 29:11.440
 but rather to just say that goal setting is the first step.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.240
 Assessment of whether or not one is making progress

29:14.240 --> 29:16.680
 towards those goals is a second but necessary step.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.260
 And then there's the business of goal execution.

29:19.260 --> 29:21.560
 And that brings us back to the neural circuit components.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.440
 Remember, this neural circuit involving

29:23.440 --> 29:24.360
 those four things earlier,

29:24.360 --> 29:26.920
 the amygdala striatum over frontal cortex

29:26.920 --> 29:29.340
 and the prefrontal cortex,

29:29.340 --> 29:31.740
 they work together to divide the whole process,

29:31.740 --> 29:34.440
 as I mentioned before, into two general categories.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.640
 The first is assessing value,

29:36.640 --> 29:39.860
 knowing whether or not where one is at one given moment

29:39.860 --> 29:42.600
 relates to some external thing.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.600
 Are things going well or are things going poorly?

29:45.600 --> 29:47.840
 And knowing how to gauge that accurately.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.840
 And then action steps, goes and no goes,

29:50.840 --> 29:52.280
 do more of this, do less of that,

29:52.280 --> 29:54.480
 do this, don't do that, et cetera.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.400
 So now we are going to shift back to the neuroscience

29:57.400 --> 30:00.400
 and we're going to talk about the practical applications

30:00.400 --> 30:02.260
 of the information I just described,

30:02.260 --> 30:04.600
 because I've given you a lot of kind of academic information.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.000
 And as we do this, I'd like you to keep in mind,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.240
 what are some things that you've either accomplished

30:10.240 --> 30:12.640
 or that you'd like to accomplish going forward?

30:12.640 --> 30:13.560
 Because as we do this,

30:13.560 --> 30:15.920
 we can build toward a set of protocols that at the end,

30:15.920 --> 30:19.400
 you'll be able to very quickly plug in your particular goals

30:19.400 --> 30:21.280
 and a route to those particular goals

30:21.280 --> 30:22.560
 that's grounded in the science

30:22.560 --> 30:24.440
 and I think are going to be very effective

30:24.440 --> 30:26.960
 in allowing you to reach those goals more quickly

30:26.960 --> 30:29.400
 and with indeed less effort.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.960
 In fact, let's start with a tool now,

30:31.960 --> 30:35.140
 because as we move through all this information,

30:35.140 --> 30:37.600
 I want to make sure that people are coming away

30:37.600 --> 30:39.800
 with some practical things that they can implement

30:39.800 --> 30:41.400
 and indeed some things that you can even do

30:41.400 --> 30:45.040
 during the course of listening to or watching this podcast.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.940
 The first thing to do is to understand the difference

30:48.940 --> 30:52.880
 between peripersonal space and extra personal space.

30:52.880 --> 30:57.600
 Peripersonal space is all the space literally

30:57.600 --> 31:00.600
 that's within inside your body, the surface of your skin

31:00.600 --> 31:02.720
 and in your immediate environment.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.420
 Peripersonal space is a key concept in neuroscience

31:06.420 --> 31:08.320
 because you have particular neural circuits

31:08.320 --> 31:11.400
 and particular chemicals that are geared toward

31:11.400 --> 31:13.320
 what are called consummatory behaviors,

31:13.320 --> 31:15.840
 meaning using things and consuming things

31:15.840 --> 31:18.260
 and enjoying things that are in your immediate

31:18.260 --> 31:19.840
 peripersonal space.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.840
 Let me give you an example of this for myself

31:21.840 --> 31:23.040
 just to make it concrete.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.940
 You can imagine similar examples for yourself right now.

31:25.940 --> 31:30.420
 Within my current peripersonal space is my interoception,

31:30.420 --> 31:34.400
 my understanding or perception of my internal body.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.080
 So how quickly I'm breathing, my heart rate,

31:37.080 --> 31:39.920
 the feelings on the surface of my skin, et cetera.

31:39.920 --> 31:43.380
 But also within the confines of my peripersonal space

31:43.380 --> 31:45.280
 is this coffee mug that if you're listening to this,

31:45.280 --> 31:47.660
 you can't see this, but I'm lifting up a coffee mug,

31:47.660 --> 31:50.000
 I'm going to take a sip of coffee.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.320
 That's a consummatory behavior.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.280
 I have the coffee.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.080
 I don't have to do much or motivate much to get it.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.240
 I have other things here, pens and computer, et cetera.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.920
 Okay, so things in your peripersonal space

31:59.920 --> 32:03.000
 and consuming those things is generally governed

32:03.000 --> 32:06.480
 by a set of neurochemicals that center around

32:06.480 --> 32:08.260
 the neuromodulator serotonin.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.560
 And there are a few others as well,

32:09.560 --> 32:11.940
 things like oxytocin, but mainly serotonin.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.080
 Contrast that with the so-called extra personal space.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.000
 Extra personal space is everything beyond

32:18.000 --> 32:19.420
 the confines of my reach.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.120
 It would be something in the next room.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.780
 It would be something down the street.

32:22.780 --> 32:26.160
 It will be something at some other location

32:26.160 --> 32:28.480
 in space and time.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.680
 And the neuromodulators and neurochemicals

32:30.680 --> 32:33.840
 that are associated with any kind of thinking about

32:33.840 --> 32:36.000
 anything in the extra personal space

32:36.000 --> 32:38.420
 are distinct from the neurochemicals and neuromodulators

32:38.420 --> 32:40.520
 that are involved in thinking about

32:40.520 --> 32:43.720
 or making actions towards the peripersonal space.

32:43.720 --> 32:47.000
 And the molecule that's most associated with thinking about

32:47.000 --> 32:49.260
 or orienting toward the extra personal space,

32:49.260 --> 32:51.260
 again, things beyond the confines of my skin

32:51.260 --> 32:53.960
 or your skin is dopamine.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.760
 And this is a vitally important concept to understand

32:56.760 --> 32:59.000
 when you're setting goals and seeking goals.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.780
 If we are to be good at goal-seeking,

33:03.780 --> 33:07.600
 if we are to be good at setting goals and assessing goals,

33:07.600 --> 33:09.800
 if we are to achieve our goals,

33:09.800 --> 33:13.880
 we have to be able to toggle back and forth

33:13.880 --> 33:18.440
 between a clear understanding of our peripersonal space,

33:18.440 --> 33:22.200
 what we have and how we feel in the immediate present,

33:22.200 --> 33:25.980
 and our ability to understand what's out there

33:25.980 --> 33:28.160
 in the extra personal space

33:28.160 --> 33:31.820
 and our ability to move into that extra personal space.

33:31.820 --> 33:33.720
 And a simple way to conceive of all this

33:33.720 --> 33:38.720
 is that we evaluate our progress in the peripersonal space.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.920
 We evaluate how we feel about some pursuit,

33:42.920 --> 33:45.200
 even if we haven't initiated that pursuit yet.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.440
 How we feel about a particular goal

33:47.440 --> 33:50.120
 is truly a feeling that we experience in the here and now,

33:50.120 --> 33:52.640
 even though the goal is in the future, okay?

33:54.040 --> 33:55.640
 If we are going to evaluate whether or not

33:55.640 --> 33:58.400
 we made progress today or yesterday or not,

33:58.400 --> 34:00.760
 that's an evaluation of how we feel

34:00.760 --> 34:03.200
 in the immediate peripersonal space.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.960
 However, moving toward any goal

34:06.960 --> 34:09.160
 involves orienting our thinking

34:09.160 --> 34:11.640
 towards the extra personal space.

34:11.640 --> 34:13.700
 And as we go through today's episode,

34:13.700 --> 34:15.320
 I'm going to teach you a technique

34:15.320 --> 34:17.640
 or rather a neuroscience-based tool

34:17.640 --> 34:21.000
 that will allow you to continually transition back and forth

34:21.000 --> 34:24.560
 between the peripersonal space and the extra personal space

34:24.560 --> 34:28.220
 in a way that will allow you to update and evaluate

34:28.220 --> 34:30.480
 and better execute your goal-seeking.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.600
 The whole principle behind this

34:33.600 --> 34:36.400
 is that human beings like other animals

34:36.400 --> 34:38.360
 have to make evaluations about whether or not

34:38.360 --> 34:40.520
 they are on the right track.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.480
 However, the important thing to understand

34:42.480 --> 34:45.440
 is that humans in particular can do this

34:45.440 --> 34:47.100
 over different timescales.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.120
 We don't just pursue food because we are hungry,

34:49.120 --> 34:53.200
 we pursue food, excuse me, for a particular meal

34:53.200 --> 34:55.660
 that we might be having with people tomorrow, right?

34:55.660 --> 34:57.240
 We can modulate the timescale

34:57.240 --> 34:59.040
 in a way that other animals don't.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.920
 That's how we adjust our goal-seeking

35:00.920 --> 35:02.400
 to different timescales.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.360
 And in addition to that,

35:04.360 --> 35:08.160
 humans are exquisitely good at biasing our behavior

35:08.160 --> 35:12.000
 toward particular goals over very long periods of time.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.780
 But there are a lot of mistakes out there.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.280
 In fact, things that are outright wrong in the literature

35:16.280 --> 35:17.480
 and in particular in the internet

35:17.480 --> 35:19.440
 and then the kind of wellness and fitness

35:19.440 --> 35:21.800
 and cognitive fitness space

35:21.800 --> 35:24.540
 that send people down the wrong path.

35:24.540 --> 35:27.140
 And those things we will talk about in a few minutes,

35:27.140 --> 35:29.240
 but things like visualization,

35:29.240 --> 35:31.960
 that visualization and visualization of this big goal

35:31.960 --> 35:34.240
 is the best way to achieve your goals.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.160
 In fact, that's not the case.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.840
 There's a much better approach to doing all this.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.520
 So now I'd like to shift gears

35:40.520 --> 35:42.440
 towards talking about a few of the things

35:42.440 --> 35:44.640
 that most people get badly wrong

35:44.640 --> 35:48.680
 in setting and assessing and executing goals.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.840
 This is based on peer-reviewed research.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.420
 So I think it's very solid.

35:52.420 --> 35:53.940
 I know it is very solid.

35:53.940 --> 35:57.560
 And it runs counter to what many of us have been taught.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.040
 Let's start with a simple one.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.680
 We've all heard that multitasking is bad, okay?

36:01.680 --> 36:03.220
 We hear multitasking is bad.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.340
 It doesn't allow for focus.

36:04.340 --> 36:05.740
 If you want to achieve anything,

36:05.740 --> 36:08.840
 you want to accomplish anything, you should not multitask.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.020
 Well, it turns out that's wrong.

36:11.020 --> 36:14.320
 It turns out that there is a role for multitasking,

36:14.320 --> 36:18.500
 but the multitasking has to be placed at a particular time

36:18.500 --> 36:22.520
 within your goal seeking behavior in order to be effective.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.520
 Really nice studies done at Carnegie Mellon University

36:27.520 --> 36:31.080
 and the Dabish Lab evaluated how long people are able

36:31.080 --> 36:33.280
 to focus in different environments,

36:33.280 --> 36:35.860
 how long they were able to stay concentrated on their work.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.120
 And it turns out that number is exceedingly low.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.540
 It turns out that most people,

36:40.540 --> 36:42.360
 whether or not they're doing computer work

36:42.360 --> 36:45.160
 or whether or not they're doing writing or accounting work

36:45.160 --> 36:48.200
 or anything of that sort can hold their attention

36:48.200 --> 36:49.960
 for about three minutes at a time

36:49.960 --> 36:52.240
 before they shift their attention off.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.440
 That's ridiculously low when you first hear it,

36:55.440 --> 36:59.860
 but that probably reflects a basic state of brain function

36:59.860 --> 37:02.760
 that hearkens back to a time when we were hunter gatherers.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.340
 I doubt that we were maintaining focus solidly

37:05.340 --> 37:06.520
 for hours and hours and hours

37:06.520 --> 37:08.480
 unless we were under some particular threat

37:08.480 --> 37:10.880
 or in some particular crisis.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.180
 Rather, you could imagine that people collected seeds

37:13.180 --> 37:14.640
 and nuts and berries for about three minutes

37:14.640 --> 37:15.480
 and then probably stood up,

37:15.480 --> 37:17.360
 looked around and then kept going, okay?

37:17.360 --> 37:19.120
 Or that they were hunting animals

37:19.120 --> 37:21.720
 or in some sort of pursuit, fishing, et cetera,

37:21.720 --> 37:23.120
 and focused, focused, focused.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.080
 And then every three minutes or so,

37:24.080 --> 37:26.480
 they might've looked up and taken a look at the sky

37:26.480 --> 37:27.600
 or looked around to make sure

37:27.600 --> 37:30.480
 that other people were there or not there, et cetera.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.240
 It all stands to reason that that will be the case.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.640
 Again, the neural circuits haven't evolved much.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.300
 Now, multitasking has been shown

37:37.300 --> 37:41.400
 to have a very interesting physiological signature.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.440
 When we multitask,

37:42.440 --> 37:45.320
 when we jump back and forth between things,

37:45.320 --> 37:49.120
 there is an increase in the level of the neurotransmitter,

37:49.120 --> 37:50.920
 also sometimes called a neuromodulator,

37:50.920 --> 37:53.240
 but basically same thing for sake of this discussion.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.600
 There's an increase in the neurotransmitter epinephrine,

37:55.600 --> 37:57.040
 which is adrenaline.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.440
 And so there are really nice studies now

37:59.440 --> 38:02.360
 pointing to the fact that doing a bit of multitasking

38:02.360 --> 38:07.160
 prior to jumping into some focused goal-directed behavior,

38:07.160 --> 38:09.040
 whether or not it's mental behavior or physical behavior,

38:09.040 --> 38:12.520
 it can actually be useful because it gets us into action.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.920
 So we've all been told that multitasking is terrible.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.880
 But if you, for instance,

38:15.880 --> 38:17.360
 find yourself cleaning up your house

38:17.360 --> 38:19.240
 and also checking your phone and doing a number of things

38:19.240 --> 38:22.080
 right at the point where you should be sitting down to write

38:22.080 --> 38:23.620
 or do some focused work,

38:23.620 --> 38:26.020
 it probably reflects some adaptive mechanism

38:26.020 --> 38:29.760
 where you use action and somewhat varied multitasking action

38:29.760 --> 38:31.820
 in order to generate adrenaline in your system,

38:31.820 --> 38:34.480
 because adrenaline just gets you into action.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.680
 Now that's great,

38:36.680 --> 38:38.520
 but you don't want to multitask

38:38.520 --> 38:42.020
 throughout any kind of goal seeking or goal pursuit behavior

38:42.020 --> 38:44.260
 because what's also very clear,

38:44.260 --> 38:47.940
 and we're going to talk about this in exquisite depth today,

38:47.940 --> 38:49.860
 is that visual focus,

38:49.860 --> 38:52.200
 and in particular contracting your visual window,

38:52.200 --> 38:56.560
 bringing the aperture of what you see to a very fine point

38:56.560 --> 39:01.400
 can absolutely increase your clarity of goal seeking

39:01.400 --> 39:04.680
 and the likelihood that you will pursue your goals.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.720
 I've talked about this a little bit before on the podcast

39:06.720 --> 39:09.960
 as a way of increasing focus for any kind of pursuit.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
 I've talked about a practice whereby

39:11.960 --> 39:15.020
 you can literally look at a dot or a line

39:15.020 --> 39:17.320
 placed on a wall or on your computer in front of you

39:17.320 --> 39:19.440
 for 30 to 60 seconds,

39:19.440 --> 39:21.840
 and then moving into some dedicated work

39:21.840 --> 39:22.740
 where you need to focus,

39:22.740 --> 39:25.360
 and indeed just looking at a narrow piece

39:25.360 --> 39:26.200
 of the visual world,

39:26.200 --> 39:28.500
 a small piece of the visual world for some period of time

39:28.500 --> 39:31.400
 and forcing yourself to hold that gaze on that location

39:31.400 --> 39:32.940
 as best you can,

39:32.940 --> 39:35.480
 can increase your level of cognitive attention

39:35.480 --> 39:38.320
 and your ability to focus and stay focused.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.820
 And this is not magic.

39:39.820 --> 39:41.160
 It is the consequence of the fact

39:41.160 --> 39:45.120
 that most of your cognition follows your visual perception.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.020
 For those of you that are low vision or no vision,

39:47.020 --> 39:49.460
 meaning you're blind or you have trouble seeing,

39:50.400 --> 39:52.360
 my lab does a lot of work with people

39:52.360 --> 39:54.120
 who are low vision, no vision.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.000
 They tend to use their auditory system,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.160
 their hearing as a way to anchor their attention

39:58.160 --> 39:59.280
 to particular things, okay?

39:59.280 --> 40:02.400
 But most people out there can see and see pretty well,

40:02.400 --> 40:05.880
 and visual focus is the way to do that.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.800
 Now, earlier we were talking about this notion

40:08.800 --> 40:13.400
 of peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.160
 And I'm just going to seed a little bit

40:15.160 --> 40:16.520
 of the later conversation by saying

40:16.520 --> 40:20.840
 that when we focus on an external point,

40:20.840 --> 40:23.320
 we are in a process of exteroception,

40:23.320 --> 40:25.520
 focus on the extrapersonal space,

40:25.520 --> 40:27.860
 not the peripersonal space.

40:27.860 --> 40:32.080
 So when we focus on something, say a line on the wall

40:32.080 --> 40:35.400
 for 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer for 30 to 60 seconds

40:35.400 --> 40:38.800
 and just look at it and then move into any kind of action,

40:38.800 --> 40:41.340
 whether or not it's work action or physical action,

40:41.340 --> 40:43.600
 we are at its very core,

40:43.600 --> 40:46.800
 we are engaging in this pursuit of extrapersonal space.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.360
 We are placing our focus outside our body

40:49.360 --> 40:51.240
 and therefore we are placing the brain

40:51.240 --> 40:53.120
 into goal pursuit mode.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.680
 Work at NYU, in particular in the laboratory

40:57.680 --> 41:01.000
 of a phenomenal researcher in their psychology department

41:01.000 --> 41:05.440
 by the name of Emily Balcetis, B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S,

41:05.440 --> 41:08.820
 Emily Balcetis has done really nice work on this.

41:08.820 --> 41:11.440
 They've done is they've had people focus

41:11.440 --> 41:14.540
 their visual attention on a goal line of some sort,

41:14.540 --> 41:17.560
 and then to engage in some sort of behavior

41:17.560 --> 41:18.840
 that requires a lot of effort.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.280
 And they've done a lot of different experiments like this,

41:21.280 --> 41:22.580
 but I'll just explain one.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.240
 They always include a control group

41:24.240 --> 41:27.420
 where people have to go through the same physical effort

41:27.420 --> 41:30.380
 or mental effort, but they don't focus their attention

41:30.380 --> 41:31.840
 just on one location.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.040
 The long and short of these studies

41:34.040 --> 41:37.000
 is that when people have to focus their attention

41:37.000 --> 41:39.260
 on one location, like a goal line,

41:39.260 --> 41:42.040
 they are much more effective in reaching those goals

41:42.040 --> 41:45.080
 and they achieve them with the perception

41:45.080 --> 41:47.020
 that they expended less effort.

41:47.020 --> 41:49.580
 I'll give you an example of one particularly nice study

41:49.580 --> 41:50.960
 from the Balcetis lab.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.040
 So this particular study involves physical exercise,

41:54.040 --> 41:55.020
 although, as I mentioned before,

41:55.020 --> 41:58.680
 they've done similar studies looking at cognitive type work.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.720
 And what they did is they had a group of people

42:01.720 --> 42:05.360
 exercise wearing 15 pound ankle weights,

42:05.360 --> 42:07.580
 and they had to basically move a certain distance

42:07.580 --> 42:10.280
 or run a certain distance to reach a goal line.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.520
 One group was focused on the goal line,

42:12.520 --> 42:14.280
 visually focused on the goal line.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.740
 The other group was not told to visually focus

42:16.740 --> 42:17.720
 on the goal line.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.880
 And what they found was that the group

42:19.880 --> 42:21.360
 that focused on the goal line

42:22.200 --> 42:25.000
 was able to achieve reaching that goal

42:25.000 --> 42:29.880
 with 17% less effort, they measured effort,

42:29.880 --> 42:33.120
 and it got there 23% quicker.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.040
 That's a remarkable difference, right?

42:35.040 --> 42:37.800
 So same distance traveled with same workload

42:37.800 --> 42:41.260
 because everyone's wearing the same 15 pound weights

42:41.260 --> 42:42.100
 on their ankles.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.400
 One group is simply looking at the goal line.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.680
 The other group is not told to look at the goal line.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.400
 Simply by looking at the goal line does something

42:49.400 --> 42:52.620
 to the psychology and physiology of these people

42:52.620 --> 42:57.000
 that allows them to move forward with less perceived effort

42:57.000 --> 42:58.360
 and to do it more quickly.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.280
 That's remarkable, right?

43:00.280 --> 43:02.120
 And in this case, they're focused on the goal line,

43:02.120 --> 43:03.800
 but in a few moments, we'll talk about

43:03.800 --> 43:06.040
 how one can use updating of goal lines,

43:06.040 --> 43:07.160
 so incremental goal lines,

43:07.160 --> 43:08.840
 starting with an intermediate goal

43:08.840 --> 43:11.160
 and then extending the goal line further and further.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.400
 But just sit back for a second and think about that.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.860
 Just by changing where a person looks,

43:16.860 --> 43:19.020
 they change their perceived effort

43:19.020 --> 43:22.840
 and their ability to do something more effectively,

43:22.840 --> 43:27.080
 more quickly than a group that is not deliberately focusing

43:27.080 --> 43:29.340
 their visual attention on one location.

43:29.340 --> 43:30.520
 That's incredible.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.120
 And it's so incredible, in fact, you might say,

43:32.120 --> 43:33.860
 well, how could that possibly be?

43:33.860 --> 43:36.120
 Well, it turns out it has a very specific

43:36.120 --> 43:38.000
 underlying physiological reason,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
 and that has to do with changes

43:40.000 --> 43:42.040
 in our so-called autonomic nervous system,

43:42.040 --> 43:44.120
 the aspects of our nervous system

43:44.120 --> 43:46.760
 that prepare us for readiness and action,

43:46.760 --> 43:50.280
 or that prepare us for resting and relaxing.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.560
 So what is special about focusing one's visual attention

43:53.560 --> 43:55.280
 at a given location?

43:55.280 --> 43:56.960
 Well, it turns out that we have two branches

43:56.960 --> 43:57.880
 of our visual system.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.680
 So visual information all comes in through our eyes,

44:00.680 --> 44:03.440
 but then it can head down two different pathways.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.080
 One pathway is engaged when our vision

44:06.080 --> 44:07.300
 is brought to a common point,

44:07.300 --> 44:08.720
 what we call a vergence eye movement.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.360
 So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point,

44:11.360 --> 44:14.460
 regardless of how far away from us that point is,

44:14.460 --> 44:17.640
 our visual system engages a certain set of neurons,

44:17.640 --> 44:21.480
 neural circuits, that are involved in resolving fine detail,

44:21.480 --> 44:23.560
 and that can evaluate small changes

44:23.560 --> 44:24.880
 over small periods of time.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.500
 Just think of it as a very detailed camera

44:27.500 --> 44:30.160
 of the visual world, and it tends to be very restricted.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.260
 The other pathway through the visual system

44:32.260 --> 44:33.920
 is a so-called magnocellular pathway,

44:33.920 --> 44:35.480
 and this is a pathway that's involved

44:35.480 --> 44:37.240
 in taking in global information

44:37.240 --> 44:39.960
 about lots of things that are happening around us,

44:39.960 --> 44:41.200
 movement of things to our right,

44:41.200 --> 44:42.440
 movement of things to our left,

44:42.440 --> 44:43.860
 things that are happening down on the ground

44:43.860 --> 44:46.520
 and all around us, and that pathway

44:46.520 --> 44:49.700
 involves a sort of relaxation, if you will,

44:49.700 --> 44:51.560
 of the neural circuits that are associated

44:51.560 --> 44:52.920
 with alertness and attention.

44:52.920 --> 44:53.880
 When you walk down the street

44:53.880 --> 44:54.840
 and you're not thinking about much,

44:54.840 --> 44:56.440
 provided you're not looking at your phone,

44:56.440 --> 44:58.560
 you're not focusing on one location,

44:58.560 --> 45:00.620
 you're more or less in a relaxed state

45:00.620 --> 45:02.760
 compared to when you're looking for a particular sign,

45:02.760 --> 45:04.680
 you're looking for a bus or a train that's coming

45:04.680 --> 45:05.680
 or a particular person,

45:05.680 --> 45:07.760
 and that should inherently make sense.

45:07.760 --> 45:10.000
 When your level of attention and alertness goes up,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.840
 there's sort of a small but perceptible increase

45:12.840 --> 45:14.160
 in your level of arousal.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.020
 It's not really stress necessarily,

45:16.020 --> 45:18.200
 but arousal of alertness.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.640
 And it turns out that the visual system

45:20.640 --> 45:23.200
 accomplishes this increase in alertness

45:23.200 --> 45:26.280
 by communicating with your circulatory system

45:26.280 --> 45:28.520
 and the system that delivers blood and nutrients

45:28.520 --> 45:31.080
 and oxygen to the rest of the tissues in your body.

45:31.080 --> 45:33.800
 So let's talk for a second about what focusing our vision

45:33.800 --> 45:35.160
 on a particular location does,

45:35.160 --> 45:37.100
 because in this study from the Balcetas lab,

45:37.100 --> 45:39.040
 what they found was focusing on a goal line

45:39.040 --> 45:41.520
 allows people to move more effectively toward that goal.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.880
 This is something you can leverage in all aspects

45:43.880 --> 45:46.080
 of all goal pursuits.

45:46.080 --> 45:49.660
 What happens when we focus on a particular location?

45:49.660 --> 45:50.720
 Believe it or not,

45:50.720 --> 45:52.840
 there's an increase in a particular feature

45:52.840 --> 45:54.640
 of our blood pressure.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.120
 Now your body has, of course,

45:56.120 --> 45:58.820
 arteries, veins, and capillaries,

45:58.820 --> 46:01.660
 and your heart pumps blood first to the arteries

46:01.660 --> 46:04.480
 and then to the other components of your vascular system.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.960
 And we have so-called blood pressure, right?

46:06.960 --> 46:09.300
 Blood pressure is just how much the fluid volume

46:09.300 --> 46:12.400
 is pressing on those arteries, veins, and capillaries, right?

46:12.400 --> 46:13.260
 So you can imagine a pipe

46:13.260 --> 46:15.120
 with very little fluid moving through it,

46:15.120 --> 46:16.000
 that's low pressure.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.340
 You have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it,

46:18.340 --> 46:19.240
 that's even more pressure.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.480
 You have a pipe with a lot of very viscous,

46:21.480 --> 46:24.200
 meaning very kind of sticky thick stuff moving forward,

46:24.200 --> 46:25.560
 that's even more pressure.

46:25.560 --> 46:26.620
 We have blood pressure,

46:26.620 --> 46:28.560
 and you've probably had your blood pressure measured.

46:28.560 --> 46:29.980
 There's always two numbers, right?

46:29.980 --> 46:32.720
 You have a top number, which is the systolic blood pressure,

46:32.720 --> 46:35.080
 and then there's the bottom number below the line,

46:35.080 --> 46:37.200
 which is the diastolic pressure.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.480
 So the important thing to understand

46:38.480 --> 46:41.320
 is that your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats

46:41.320 --> 46:43.880
 because there's more fluid moving through those pipes

46:43.880 --> 46:46.160
 that are your arteries, your veins, and your capillaries.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.940
 And that top number is called the systole

46:48.940 --> 46:50.740
 or the systolic blood pressure,

46:50.740 --> 46:52.300
 because that's the pressure

46:52.300 --> 46:55.160
 at the time when your heart contracts, okay?

46:55.160 --> 46:56.380
 So the top number,

46:56.380 --> 46:58.680
 which normally if you have a healthy blood pressure

46:58.680 --> 47:01.960
 is somewhere in the range of 90 to 120 millimeters

47:01.960 --> 47:02.800
 of mercury.

47:02.800 --> 47:03.680
 Millimeters of mercury is just the way

47:03.680 --> 47:04.800
 that pressure is measured.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.840
 That top number, your systole,

47:06.840 --> 47:08.600
 your systolic blood pressure

47:08.600 --> 47:11.720
 is what's measured when the heart contracts, okay?

47:11.720 --> 47:15.200
 So that's the amount of pressure when there's a heartbeat

47:15.200 --> 47:18.000
 and it's moving through your vasculature.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.640
 Now, between beats, right?

47:19.640 --> 47:21.600
 The heart beats, but then it relaxes.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.960
 Your blood pressure is going to drop to a lower value, right?

47:24.960 --> 47:27.060
 Because fluid isn't being pumped through the system

47:27.060 --> 47:28.160
 at those moments.

47:28.160 --> 47:31.320
 And that's the bottom value, the diastolic pressure.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.640
 And typically for healthy people,

47:32.640 --> 47:35.680
 that's going to be 60 to 80 millimeters of mercury.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.760
 So you might hear about a normal blood pressure

47:37.760 --> 47:41.760
 being about, again, this is an approximate, 120 over 80.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.080
 What that means is at the point where blood was being pumped

47:45.080 --> 47:47.600
 through your arteries and veins, boom,

47:47.600 --> 47:50.840
 that it's 120 millimeters of mercury.

47:50.840 --> 47:53.240
 But then when the heart relaxes for a second

47:53.240 --> 47:57.340
 before the next beat, then it drops to 80, okay?

47:57.340 --> 47:58.940
 So there's high pressure, low pressure,

47:58.940 --> 48:00.240
 high pressure, low pressure.

48:00.240 --> 48:03.180
 The fluid is being pumped through the system.

48:03.180 --> 48:04.400
 Now, why am I telling you all this?

48:04.400 --> 48:07.160
 Well, it turns out that there are neural circuits

48:07.160 --> 48:09.640
 that link your visual system

48:09.640 --> 48:13.160
 and focusing on a particular point with that top number,

48:13.160 --> 48:14.680
 the systolic blood pressure.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.960
 And when you focus your eyes on a particular location,

48:17.960 --> 48:20.320
 that systolic blood pressure goes up,

48:20.320 --> 48:23.000
 and there are some other systems that are coordinated with

48:23.000 --> 48:26.480
 it in your brain and body that start releasing adrenaline,

48:26.480 --> 48:28.660
 low amounts of adrenaline in most cases,

48:28.660 --> 48:32.040
 and that adrenaline further readies your body for action.

48:32.040 --> 48:36.020
 So bringing our visual focus to a particular location

48:36.020 --> 48:37.800
 does a number of things to the brain

48:37.800 --> 48:40.920
 and the whole system of the body to prepare it,

48:40.920 --> 48:43.520
 to place it into a state of readiness

48:43.520 --> 48:47.160
 that makes us more likely to lean into our goals,

48:47.160 --> 48:48.240
 into action.

48:48.240 --> 48:49.600
 And if we step back and think about this,

48:49.600 --> 48:51.080
 this makes perfect sense.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.600
 The brain and body need to be coordinated.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.260
 We can't just think about a goal.

48:54.260 --> 48:57.640
 In fact, a deer or a lion can't just think about a goal.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.560
 It has to think about a goal

48:59.560 --> 49:03.400
 and then has to feel some sort of activation energy,

49:03.400 --> 49:06.180
 some willingness or desire to move forward

49:06.180 --> 49:07.660
 in pursuit of that goal.

49:07.660 --> 49:11.480
 So imagining a goal has to be coupled

49:11.480 --> 49:13.120
 to the physical pursuit of the goal.

49:13.120 --> 49:16.000
 So our visual system in a beautiful way

49:16.000 --> 49:18.800
 brings together a focus, literally a visual focus

49:18.800 --> 49:21.440
 on a particular point outside us.

49:21.440 --> 49:25.040
 Then it recruits an increase in systolic blood pressure,

49:25.040 --> 49:28.760
 which creates a systemic, a body-wide and brain-wide

49:28.760 --> 49:32.660
 increase in fuel utilization, in oxygen availability,

49:32.660 --> 49:35.100
 in our willingness to move forward as a body,

49:35.100 --> 49:37.040
 as a whole coherent system.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.360
 And then there are also neurotransmitter systems

49:39.360 --> 49:42.840
 like epinephrine, as we will soon see dopamine,

49:42.840 --> 49:44.240
 that get recruited as well

49:44.240 --> 49:47.040
 to place us into a continual mode of action.

49:47.920 --> 49:51.960
 This to me is a remarkable feature of our physiology.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.600
 And it gets right to the point

49:53.600 --> 49:55.640
 of some of the psychological phenomenon

49:55.640 --> 49:56.920
 that we were talking about earlier.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.320
 Let's just recall what some of those are.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.800
 I won't list them all, but you know,

49:59.800 --> 50:02.360
 a goal has to be significant, they say, okay?

50:02.360 --> 50:04.400
 All the psychologists, all the popular stuff online

50:04.400 --> 50:07.420
 says it has to be significant, has to be inspirational,

50:07.420 --> 50:08.980
 and it has to be action-oriented.

50:08.980 --> 50:11.520
 Okay, so let's say you look out into the landscape

50:11.520 --> 50:12.860
 of what's available to you,

50:12.860 --> 50:14.240
 whether or not it's just in your mind,

50:14.240 --> 50:15.760
 or you look at a specific point.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.560
 You say, ah, I want to go to that particular restaurant

50:18.560 --> 50:20.020
 to eat that particular food,

50:20.020 --> 50:22.160
 and you orient towards it and you move towards it.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.780
 This is the way that your brain and body

50:23.780 --> 50:25.760
 are coordinating their actions together.

50:25.760 --> 50:29.800
 Conversely, when our visual system

50:29.800 --> 50:31.760
 is in a mode of looking at everything,

50:31.760 --> 50:34.500
 when the aperture of our visual system is very broad,

50:35.440 --> 50:37.840
 we know that there's also a reduction

50:37.840 --> 50:39.240
 in our goal-directed behavior

50:39.240 --> 50:42.280
 and a reduction in the systolic blood pressure.

50:42.280 --> 50:45.800
 It's as if our peripersonal space is sufficient.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.880
 We don't need to get beyond our current state.

50:47.880 --> 50:50.980
 We're not oriented toward any one thing in particular.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.320
 Okay, so I've now described some of the psychology

50:53.320 --> 50:55.440
 and some of the underlying physiology.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.140
 Now I'd like to mesh this within the context

50:58.140 --> 51:01.560
 of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit,

51:01.560 --> 51:03.280
 because what many of you are probably thinking is,

51:03.280 --> 51:05.380
 okay, well, that's some physiology, there's some psychology,

51:05.380 --> 51:07.300
 but how do you actually apply this

51:07.300 --> 51:09.080
 towards setting and achieving goals?

51:09.080 --> 51:13.600
 Well, you do that by understanding that your mental frame

51:13.600 --> 51:16.920
 and your attention are always either positioned

51:16.920 --> 51:18.580
 to your peripersonal space,

51:18.580 --> 51:22.160
 focused on your immediate possessions and state,

51:22.160 --> 51:23.920
 or towards things outside you,

51:23.920 --> 51:26.400
 but that you also have the ability to dynamically travel

51:26.400 --> 51:27.680
 back and forth between those.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.920
 And so next we're going to talk about

51:28.920 --> 51:32.120
 what the literature says about things like visualization,

51:32.120 --> 51:34.360
 immediate and intermediate goals,

51:34.360 --> 51:36.840
 long-term goals, and how to best achieve those.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.300
 And then we're going to move specifically

51:38.300 --> 51:40.080
 into the protocols that you can use.

51:40.080 --> 51:42.800
 It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you,

51:42.800 --> 51:45.260
 the listeners, in order to incorporate all the science

51:45.260 --> 51:48.520
 into a best practice that you can do anytime,

51:48.520 --> 51:51.740
 any place to really identify what it is specifically

51:51.740 --> 51:54.220
 that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue

51:54.220 --> 51:55.460
 and achieve that goal.

51:55.460 --> 51:58.560
 Focusing our visual attention on one particular point

51:58.560 --> 52:01.760
 is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit.

52:01.760 --> 52:04.000
 And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies

52:04.000 --> 52:06.760
 or read a review of the scientific studies

52:06.760 --> 52:09.880
 that have looked at how narrowing one's visual attention

52:09.880 --> 52:13.560
 can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals,

52:13.560 --> 52:14.880
 I'll put a link to this study.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.820
 The title of the study is keeping the goal in sight,

52:17.820 --> 52:20.340
 testing the influence of narrowed visual attention

52:20.340 --> 52:21.720
 on physical activity.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.940
 And this is a paper from Emily Balsettis' lab,

52:24.940 --> 52:26.780
 focuses mainly on physical activities,

52:26.780 --> 52:28.760
 but it mentioned some other things as well.

52:28.760 --> 52:31.480
 This is a article published in Personality

52:31.480 --> 52:33.580
 and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020.

52:33.580 --> 52:37.440
 So it's recent, it's exceptional paper in my opinion,

52:37.440 --> 52:39.640
 really gets to the heart of how all this works

52:39.640 --> 52:41.780
 and some examples of where it's been implemented.

52:41.780 --> 52:45.060
 So let's apply this visual tool in a very simple way

52:45.060 --> 52:47.480
 to any type of goal that you want to pursue.

52:47.480 --> 52:51.120
 If you already know what goal you want to pursue,

52:51.120 --> 52:52.000
 maybe it's a workout,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.740
 maybe it's a cognitive work of some particular sort.

52:54.740 --> 52:56.400
 Again, the process is very simple.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.000
 You're going to focus your visual attention

52:58.000 --> 53:01.240
 on one point beyond your peripersonal space.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.360
 So it could be on your computer, it could be on the wall,

53:03.360 --> 53:06.040
 it could be a horizon, it could be at a distance,

53:06.040 --> 53:08.260
 and you're going to focus your visual attention there.

53:08.260 --> 53:09.100
 And with some effort,

53:09.100 --> 53:10.560
 you're going to hold your visual attention

53:10.560 --> 53:12.300
 for 30 to 60 seconds.

53:12.300 --> 53:14.080
 You might blink, that's okay,

53:14.080 --> 53:14.920
 but you're going to try

53:14.920 --> 53:16.040
 and hold your visual attention there.

53:16.040 --> 53:17.780
 So no moving your head around,

53:17.780 --> 53:19.720
 no diverting your attention to other locations.

53:19.720 --> 53:21.320
 Some people will find it very easy to do,

53:21.320 --> 53:23.040
 other people will find it quite hard.

53:23.040 --> 53:25.660
 Your mind may drift cognitively, that's okay,

53:25.660 --> 53:27.440
 but try and bring your visual attention

53:27.440 --> 53:28.620
 to that common point.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.320
 Several episodes ago, I talked about

53:31.320 --> 53:32.700
 how there are actually studies

53:32.700 --> 53:35.280
 looking at developing this kind of training in students

53:35.280 --> 53:38.720
 for ADHD and the data on that are actually quite encouraging.

53:38.720 --> 53:41.240
 So for people who have ADHD and focus issues

53:41.240 --> 53:43.340
 and attentional issues, this can be effective.

53:43.340 --> 53:46.280
 For people who don't, this can also be effective.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.240
 Again, it places your brain and body

53:48.240 --> 53:49.440
 into a state of readiness.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.480
 And then the idea is to move into the particular actions

53:52.480 --> 53:54.240
 that bring you closer to your goal, okay?

53:54.240 --> 53:56.240
 We haven't yet talked about how to set goals

53:56.240 --> 53:57.440
 and how to assess progress.

53:57.440 --> 54:00.520
 This is simply how to pursue goals, okay?

54:00.520 --> 54:02.880
 But the visual component is important.

54:02.880 --> 54:05.760
 In fact, I would argue that the visual system

54:05.760 --> 54:08.300
 and harnessing your visual attention to a narrow point

54:08.300 --> 54:10.340
 is going to be the most effective way

54:10.340 --> 54:12.720
 to get your brain and body into a mode of action

54:12.720 --> 54:15.800
 to pursue whatever goal it is you're trying to pursue.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.620
 That practice is in stark contrast to multitasking,

54:18.620 --> 54:20.920
 where by definition, your attention is moving

54:20.920 --> 54:22.660
 from place to place to place, right?

54:22.660 --> 54:24.760
 I mentioned that multitasking can be effective

54:24.760 --> 54:26.620
 in getting your system into somewhat

54:26.620 --> 54:29.080
 of an increased level of activation

54:29.080 --> 54:30.860
 so that you can pursue a more focused goal.

54:30.860 --> 54:33.180
 But the visual attention to a particular point

54:33.180 --> 54:34.800
 is going to be the most effective way

54:34.800 --> 54:36.620
 to bring your system into a state of readiness

54:36.620 --> 54:38.160
 and action for goal pursuit.

54:38.160 --> 54:39.820
 There's another really interesting way

54:39.820 --> 54:41.700
 that you can leverage your visual system

54:41.700 --> 54:43.620
 toward long-term goals.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.400
 The Balcetas Lab has also done

54:46.400 --> 54:47.880
 some really interesting experiments

54:47.880 --> 54:50.600
 looking at people's ability to set

54:50.600 --> 54:52.260
 and stick to long-term goals.

54:52.260 --> 54:54.600
 And the long-term goal that they looked at

54:54.600 --> 54:58.600
 was one related to saving money for later in life.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.380
 This is something that a lot of people struggle with.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.400
 A lot of people have a hard time investing money

55:02.400 --> 55:04.080
 or saving money for later in life,

55:04.080 --> 55:06.160
 simply because as human beings,

55:06.160 --> 55:08.820
 we vary in the extent to which we worry

55:08.820 --> 55:10.800
 about what's going to happen later.

55:10.800 --> 55:14.400
 There's also a phenomenon of so-called delayed discounting.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.400
 Delayed discounting is the fact

55:16.400 --> 55:18.700
 that goals become less rewarding

55:18.700 --> 55:21.280
 when they exist further out in the future, okay?

55:21.280 --> 55:23.460
 You may have experienced this walking past a donut shop.

55:23.460 --> 55:24.300
 I love donuts.

55:24.300 --> 55:26.040
 I'm just going to admit it over and over again on the spot.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.920
 I love the smell of them, I love the taste of them.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.760
 I try not to eat them

55:28.760 --> 55:30.280
 because I'm told they're not that good for me

55:30.280 --> 55:32.300
 and indeed, I don't think they are.

55:32.300 --> 55:35.060
 I occasionally cave and I eat one or many,

55:35.060 --> 55:37.840
 but in general, I try not to cave

55:37.840 --> 55:40.080
 to the immediately rewarding properties

55:40.080 --> 55:42.860
 of the smell and the taste of the donut.

55:42.860 --> 55:46.500
 But what we know is that if you smell a donut

55:46.500 --> 55:48.960
 or you smell a wonderful piece of food,

55:48.960 --> 55:51.920
 in the immediate term, it brings your level of focus,

55:51.920 --> 55:54.560
 your mental focus to the immediate phase

55:54.560 --> 55:55.920
 and it feels very rewarding.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.560
 Like if you had it now, it would just be so good.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.480
 But if you actually extend that reward out to tomorrow

56:01.480 --> 56:02.320
 or the next thing you think,

56:02.320 --> 56:04.840
 oh, you know, today happens to be a Saturday

56:04.840 --> 56:06.320
 that we're recording, but oh, you know,

56:06.320 --> 56:08.460
 on Tuesday morning, I'm going to get a donut.

56:08.460 --> 56:11.780
 It doesn't have the same value because the reward system

56:11.780 --> 56:15.640
 doesn't work as well for long-term goals.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.940
 It's not as salient, it's not as tangible a goal,

56:18.940 --> 56:20.560
 especially for something like a donut.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.480
 Whereas the kinds of goals that work

56:22.480 --> 56:24.320
 when you place them out into the longer term

56:24.320 --> 56:26.380
 and can create a heightened sense of motivation

56:26.380 --> 56:28.600
 tend to be things that are much more rewarding to us.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.160
 So delayed discounting simply says

56:30.160 --> 56:32.880
 that the further out in time that a given goal is,

56:32.880 --> 56:35.400
 the less effective that reward will be

56:35.400 --> 56:36.980
 in motivating one's behavior.

56:36.980 --> 56:39.720
 And indeed, you see this with saving money for retirement,

56:39.720 --> 56:42.320
 you see this with all sorts of long-term investment.

56:43.520 --> 56:46.140
 The Balsetis lab therefore did an experiment

56:46.140 --> 56:49.320
 where they looked at people's tendency

56:49.320 --> 56:52.160
 to save money for later in life.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.760
 But the groups that they created in the study

56:54.760 --> 56:55.600
 were really interesting.

56:55.600 --> 56:58.520
 They had one group imagine what it would be like

56:58.520 --> 57:01.040
 to be 30 or 40 years older,

57:01.040 --> 57:03.840
 and then to invest a certain amount of money

57:03.840 --> 57:05.280
 according to whatever it is

57:05.280 --> 57:06.400
 they thought that they would need.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.400
 And they measured the amount that they had set aside

57:08.400 --> 57:10.980
 and saved for later in life.

57:11.960 --> 57:15.500
 The other group actually viewed photos of themselves.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.480
 So picture images of themselves

57:17.480 --> 57:20.920
 that were artificially digitally aged

57:20.920 --> 57:22.440
 so that they could see themselves

57:22.440 --> 57:25.020
 30 or 40 years into the future.

57:25.020 --> 57:27.520
 And it turns out that people in that second group

57:27.520 --> 57:32.440
 simply by perceiving their own image in the future

57:32.440 --> 57:35.920
 invested far more money into later life.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.960
 They set aside more money.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.460
 Somehow it bridged the gap

57:38.460 --> 57:40.520
 between their immediate experience of life

57:40.520 --> 57:44.160
 and the longer arc toward what it was going to be like

57:44.160 --> 57:45.640
 in 30 or 40 years.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.660
 So a very powerful result in my opinion,

57:47.660 --> 57:49.160
 because what it says again

57:49.160 --> 57:51.880
 is that our visual perception of the future

57:51.880 --> 57:54.480
 or our visual perception of the present

57:54.480 --> 57:57.480
 is what allows us to anchor our goal-directed systems

57:57.480 --> 58:00.280
 and our motivation to take on things

58:00.280 --> 58:03.200
 that in the immediate term might not seem that useful.

58:03.200 --> 58:06.480
 So you can imagine all sorts of variations on this.

58:06.480 --> 58:09.660
 You can imagine that every time I want a donut,

58:09.660 --> 58:11.360
 I'd see a vision of myself

58:11.360 --> 58:14.160
 or an actual physical picture of myself

58:14.160 --> 58:17.040
 as a consequence of having eaten many donuts every day

58:17.040 --> 58:18.080
 for the next 10 years.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.200
 I don't know what that image would look like

58:19.200 --> 58:21.200
 because I've never seen it.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.160
 That's not an experiment that I necessarily need to do

58:23.160 --> 58:25.580
 because I'm not that motivated to eat donuts.

58:25.580 --> 58:27.400
 But I have to confess,

58:27.400 --> 58:31.340
 somebody who I think I'm pretty good at managing resources,

58:31.340 --> 58:33.720
 but I think if I were to see an image of myself

58:33.720 --> 58:35.460
 at 70 or 75,

58:35.460 --> 58:36.760
 there's so many things that are associated

58:36.760 --> 58:37.640
 with visual images,

58:37.640 --> 58:39.400
 like what our body must feel like,

58:39.400 --> 58:42.480
 what our needs are probably going to be like in that state

58:42.480 --> 58:43.920
 or in that age,

58:43.920 --> 58:46.740
 what sorts of things we may or may not still be able to do

58:46.740 --> 58:47.760
 at that age.

58:47.760 --> 58:50.800
 And that anchors back to immediate goal-directed behaviors,

58:50.800 --> 58:52.820
 such as setting aside money for retirement,

58:52.820 --> 58:55.600
 such as investing in one's health practices.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.920
 And indeed, there's a study that has looked at

58:57.920 --> 59:01.580
 how people will invest in exercise and healthy eating.

59:01.580 --> 59:04.240
 If they just think about the future

59:04.240 --> 59:06.700
 and what they might be like in the future

59:06.700 --> 59:09.560
 versus seeing images of themselves in the future

59:09.560 --> 59:12.420
 if they were to go down a healthy or unhealthy route.

59:12.420 --> 59:14.820
 So again, the point is that the visual system,

59:14.820 --> 59:18.740
 what we see is principally important

59:18.740 --> 59:20.900
 in defining what we do in the immediate term,

59:20.900 --> 59:22.520
 even if what we see relates to something

59:22.520 --> 59:24.560
 in the far off distance.

59:24.560 --> 59:26.080
 I think these are phenomenal studies

59:26.080 --> 59:28.280
 and they get right down to an important issue

59:28.280 --> 59:31.360
 that's been kicked around over and over in the literature

59:31.360 --> 59:32.800
 and in the discussion about goal-seeking,

59:32.800 --> 59:34.440
 which is visualization.

59:34.440 --> 59:38.380
 We hear, keep the big goal in mind, focus on the big goal.

59:38.380 --> 59:39.680
 So now we're going to address

59:39.680 --> 59:43.480
 what does the science say about visualizing big goals?

59:43.480 --> 59:45.340
 If you're somebody who's interested in business

59:45.340 --> 59:47.520
 or let's say you're focused on relationship

59:47.520 --> 59:49.880
 is thinking about the perfect relationship

59:49.880 --> 59:50.960
 and what that would look like

59:50.960 --> 59:53.600
 and the family that you would have and where you would live,

59:53.600 --> 59:56.380
 is that effective in generating the kinds of behaviors

59:56.380 --> 59:57.480
 that will lead you to that?

59:57.480 --> 1:00:00.720
 Is it effective to think about the big win at the end?

1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:02.600
 Well, it turns out it is,

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:05.080
 but you have to be very, very careful with when

1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:07.020
 and how you implement that visualization

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:08.600
 because if you do it correctly,

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:10.660
 it can really serve your goal-seeking well.

1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:12.160
 And if you do it incorrectly,

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:14.520
 it can undermine the entire process.

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:17.040
 So does visualization work?

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:21.400
 Well, it turns out that visualization of the big win,

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:23.840
 the end goal, so the Super Bowl win

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:26.480
 or eight gold medals in the Olympics

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:30.040
 or graduation from the university of your choice

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:31.400
 or making a certain amount of money

1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:34.720
 or finding the partner of your choice, et cetera,

1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:37.080
 that visualization is effective

1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:40.360
 in getting the goal pursuit process started,

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.660
 but it actually is a pretty lousy

1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:44.780
 and maybe even counterproductive way

1:00:44.780 --> 1:00:48.040
 of maintaining pursuit of that goal,

1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:51.300
 meaning continuing to engage the sort of actions

1:00:51.300 --> 1:00:54.180
 that are going to get you to eventually achieve that goal.

1:00:54.180 --> 1:00:57.440
 I think this is going to be surprising to people at first,

1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:00.120
 but if we think back to our discussion

1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:03.960
 about the physiology of the blood pressure system,

1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:04.980
 it'll make sense.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.420
 Good scientific studies have been done

1:01:09.420 --> 1:01:11.800
 where people are told to imagine

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:14.520
 or even script out their long-term vision

1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:15.460
 and goal for themselves.

1:01:15.460 --> 1:01:16.520
 What is the big goal?

1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:19.860
 And they're taught to or told to imagine it

1:01:19.860 --> 1:01:21.720
 with a rich amount of detail to think about

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:24.360
 how it's going to feel in their body and the big win.

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.920
 And basically what happens is

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:27.280
 if you measure people's blood pressure

1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:29.000
 or other metrics of physiology,

1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.400
 you see an increase in that systolic blood pressure.

1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:34.660
 There's kind of a ramping up of the readiness

1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:36.940
 and excitement for that goal,

1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:40.160
 but that increase in blood pressure quickly wanes.

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.800
 And over time, that visual of the long-term goal

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:47.280
 becomes a poor thing to rely on

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.320
 in order to generate the actions that are required

1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:52.120
 to reach that goal.

1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:54.280
 In fact, there's a much better way

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:57.720
 to maintain ongoing action toward a goal

1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:00.140
 that also involves visualization,

1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:03.560
 but it turns out it's not about visualizing success,

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:05.700
 it's about visualizing failure.

1:02:05.700 --> 1:02:08.040
 The Balcetas lab and other labs

1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:10.840
 have looked at whether or not people make progress

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:13.260
 toward goals of different types,

1:02:13.260 --> 1:02:16.040
 whether or not they're thinking about the goal,

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:17.340
 they're thinking about that goal line

1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:18.740
 and what they want to achieve,

1:02:18.740 --> 1:02:19.740
 that long-term goal

1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:21.920
 and all the wonderful things associated with it,

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:23.560
 or whether or not they're thinking about

1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:25.480
 all the ways in which they could fail

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.680
 and route to that goal, right?

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.580
 This is not typically what we are encouraged to do.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:32.860
 Typically we are told, don't imagine failure,

1:02:32.860 --> 1:02:34.280
 push failure out of your mind,

1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:37.280
 only focus on success, fake it till you make it,

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:39.620
 or it's a phrase that I absolutely hate, frankly,

1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:41.440
 because it's not even clear what that means

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:44.120
 and it's not even clear what the ethical form of that is.

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:46.960
 I think it means continue despite any anxiety

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.680
 or fear that things won't work out.

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:52.220
 But if you look at the literature, the scientific literature,

1:02:52.220 --> 1:02:54.180
 what the Balcetas lab and other labs have shown

1:02:54.180 --> 1:02:56.280
 is that there's a near doubling,

1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:00.800
 near doubling in the probability of reaching one's goal

1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:05.800
 if you focus routinely on foreshadowing failure,

1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:09.200
 you think about the ways in which things could fail

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:12.280
 if you take action A or you take action B,

1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:14.460
 and instead therefore you take action C.

1:03:14.460 --> 1:03:16.780
 You're supposed to think about how things could fail

1:03:16.780 --> 1:03:19.000
 if you don't get up and run each morning

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.720
 if your goal is say a fitness goal.

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.460
 So let's use that as an example,

1:03:22.460 --> 1:03:25.040
 because even though I realize people are in pursuit

1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:27.020
 of many things, not just fitness,

1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:29.400
 fitness goals and physical goals are a very concrete thing

1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:31.720
 that we can all get on the same page about

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:33.840
 because they're related to actions.

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:38.840
 Let's say somebody sets a goal of running five miles

1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:41.440
 four times a week minimum and as many as seven

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.480
 four times a week minimum before 8 a.m.

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:45.060
 Okay, in a previous podcast on habits,

1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:47.480
 I talked about the benefits of not necessarily

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:49.360
 setting specific times that one will do things,

1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:51.360
 but setting time blocks that one will do things.

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:54.300
 So you say before 8 a.m. you're going to run five miles

1:03:54.300 --> 1:03:57.580
 and that's going to happen up to seven days a week, okay?

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.920
 One version of this would be, okay, sit back in a chair

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.740
 and think about how great you're going to feel and look

1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:04.800
 if you're doing this every day,

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:06.320
 how your health is going to improve,

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:08.500
 how everything's going to, your blood markers of lipids,

1:04:08.500 --> 1:04:10.440
 et cetera, are going to improve, okay, fine.

1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:14.840
 That's the visualization goal of visualizing the endpoint.

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:16.760
 Turns out that is far less effective

1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:20.200
 and maybe even counterproductive compared to thinking about

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:22.720
 what's going to happen if you don't do this,

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:25.000
 the negative health outcomes that are going to occur,

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.980
 the disappointment you're going to have in yourself,

1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:29.400
 the fact that you're going to wait until 7.30,

1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:32.140
 that's not long enough for many people to run five miles,

1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:34.120
 you got to put it on your shoes and it can be pouring rain

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.700
 or even hailing or snowing outside

1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:37.520
 and now you're not going outside unless you're somebody

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:40.260
 who's particularly motivated to do that, okay?

1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:43.620
 So foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way

1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:45.440
 to motivate toward goal pursuit.

1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:46.880
 In fact, as I mentioned before,

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:48.640
 there's a near doubling in the likelihood

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.680
 that people will reach goals of any kind

1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:52.120
 when they're constantly thinking about

1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:54.460
 how bad it's going to be if they fail.

1:04:54.460 --> 1:04:56.460
 If we think back to the neural circuit

1:04:56.460 --> 1:05:01.060
 associated with assessing value in our goal pursuits,

1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:02.040
 this makes perfect sense.

1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:03.780
 The amygdala, that center of the brain

1:05:03.780 --> 1:05:06.280
 that's involved in anxiety and fear and worry,

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:09.360
 well, the amygdala is one of the four core components

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:12.520
 of our goal setting and goal pursuit circuitry.

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:14.100
 And there's no bypassing that,

1:05:14.100 --> 1:05:16.800
 there is no one listening to this or watching this

1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:19.280
 whose amygdala is not involved in their goal setting

1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:21.280
 and goal pursuit behavior.

1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:23.020
 And so while I'd love to be able to tell you

1:05:23.020 --> 1:05:25.840
 that all you should think about is rainbows and puppies

1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:27.700
 and all the wonderful rewarding things

1:05:27.700 --> 1:05:30.400
 that are going to happen when you achieve your goals,

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.720
 the truth is you should be thinking mainly

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:35.920
 about how bad it's really going to get if you don't do it,

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:37.840
 how disappointing yourself you're going to feel,

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:40.400
 how it will negatively impact you

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:42.520
 if not in the immediate term, in the longterm,

1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:44.980
 if indeed your goal is to reach your goal.

1:05:44.980 --> 1:05:48.160
 So I want to emphasize that I'm not interested

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:50.520
 in encouraging people to flagellate themselves,

1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:54.280
 I'm encouraging people to achieve their goals.

1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:55.760
 And it turns out the best way to do that

1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:57.520
 is by foreshadowing failure.

1:05:57.520 --> 1:06:00.800
 And the more specific you can get by writing down

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:03.480
 or thinking about or talking about how bad it will be

1:06:03.480 --> 1:06:04.780
 if you don't achieve your goals,

1:06:04.780 --> 1:06:07.720
 the more likely you are to achieve those goals.

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:10.880
 Part of the reason for that almost certainly has to do

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:13.080
 with increases in systolic blood pressure

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:15.700
 and increases in readiness in your system

1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:16.920
 when you imagine failure.

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:20.960
 The brain and body are much better at moving away

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:23.360
 from fearful things than towards things we want.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:24.900
 I wish I could tell you that wasn't the case,

1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:27.920
 but there is a true asymmetry in the way we are built.

1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:30.240
 In fact, the brain and body can engage

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:31.640
 in what's called one trial learning.

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:32.920
 When something bad happens,

1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:34.240
 we eat a food that makes us sick,

1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:36.020
 we have an interaction with a person or place

1:06:36.020 --> 1:06:37.420
 that we really don't like,

1:06:37.420 --> 1:06:41.220
 it only takes one trial to really, one event, one time,

1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:43.800
 to reorient or rewire our neural circuitry

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:45.360
 so that we have a bias toward moving away

1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:46.760
 from that thing in the future.

1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:49.240
 When things go well, unfortunately,

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:50.300
 that doesn't often occur.

1:06:50.300 --> 1:06:51.820
 If things go really, really well,

1:06:51.820 --> 1:06:53.200
 it might orient our brain and body

1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:54.500
 toward wanting more of that thing

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:56.160
 and we'll have neural circuitry changes

1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:57.480
 that will lead us to engage

1:06:57.480 --> 1:07:00.100
 in that particular behavior interaction again,

1:07:00.100 --> 1:07:04.280
 but it is never as effective as these avoidance circuits.

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:05.960
 So again, foreshadow failure.

1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:08.420
 If you're going to visualize in a positive way,

1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:10.600
 do that at the very beginning of some goal pursuit,

1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:12.400
 maybe intermittently, every once in a while,

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:15.900
 you imagine the big win of scoring perfect on an exam

1:07:15.900 --> 1:07:18.080
 or winning the championship or the great relationship,

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:20.400
 but most of the time, if you want to be effective,

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:22.500
 you should be focusing on avoiding failure

1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:23.460
 and you should be really clear

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:25.880
 about what those failures would look like and feel like.

1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:28.180
 Now let's talk about goal setting.

1:07:28.180 --> 1:07:30.080
 Going back to that prominent literature,

1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:31.720
 the psychology and popular literature,

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:36.520
 again, we can hear some of these themes start to emerge.

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:38.640
 The goal should be significant, we are told.

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:40.520
 It should be inspirational.

1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:43.240
 It should be aggressive yet realistic.

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:45.600
 Well, okay, that's all fine and good,

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:47.920
 but let's get semi-quantitative about this.

1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:50.240
 Let's at least get biological about this.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.960
 How inspirational does it need to be?

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:53.080
 Does it need to be the kind of thing

1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:55.820
 that is so inspiring to me that I can't sleep at all?

1:07:55.820 --> 1:07:58.460
 Well, that wouldn't be good because I believe,

1:07:58.460 --> 1:07:59.920
 and I know many of you have heard me

1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:03.120
 say many, many times before, regular deep sleep,

1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:05.160
 80% or more of the nights that you go to sleep

1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:06.620
 is going to be crucial to your cognitive

1:08:06.620 --> 1:08:07.980
 and mental functioning and your ability

1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:09.720
 to achieve your goals in the long-term.

1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:11.120
 That's absolutely clear.

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:13.640
 So it's got to be inspirational and exciting,

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.200
 but what does that really look like

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:16.640
 and what does that correspond to

1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:18.780
 and how do we actually make that happen?

1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:21.600
 Well, once again, there is a mismatch

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:23.320
 between what the real data show

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:25.000
 and what we're most often told.

1:08:25.900 --> 1:08:29.620
 Turns out that, again, work in Balsedis' lab,

1:08:29.620 --> 1:08:32.120
 but also other laboratories has addressed

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:37.120
 whether or not the probability of achieving a goal

1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.560
 goes up or down depending on whether or not one visualizes

1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:46.560
 or sets a goal that is easy, moderate or impossible.

1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:49.720
 Okay, an impossible goal would be, for instance,

1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:53.860
 if I say, I'm going to jump from my front driveway

1:08:53.860 --> 1:08:55.160
 all the way up to the road,

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:56.560
 the road's quite a distance away,

1:08:56.560 --> 1:08:58.560
 it's more than 20 meters away, it's just not going to happen.

1:08:58.560 --> 1:08:59.640
 It's not going to happen in this lifetime,

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:01.640
 it's not going to happen in any other lifetime,

1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:04.200
 not unless it involves some elaborate technology

1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:06.360
 that I'm not aware of, a jet pack or something like that.

1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:08.440
 It's just not going to happen, right?

1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:11.120
 An easy goal would be something like, can you jump

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:12.880
 or could I jump two feet in front of me?

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:13.720
 Obviously, yes.

1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:15.440
 Okay, now I'm using a trivial example here,

1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:17.500
 but this could be translated to any kind of goal,

1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:19.840
 school goal, physical goal, et cetera.

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:23.800
 Turns out that when people set goals,

1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:26.320
 whether or not they are nutritional goals,

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.120
 eat more of this or eat less of that,

1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:30.760
 whether or not they're fitness goals, run more, lift more,

1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:33.400
 or some other goal, swim less, swim more,

1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:35.440
 whatever it is their goal happens to be,

1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.440
 some learning goal, some relationship goal,

1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:41.000
 some attempt to modify their behavior,

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.560
 turns out that if the goal is too easy,

1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:45.320
 it's too within reach,

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:49.240
 it doesn't recruit enough of the autonomic nervous system

1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:52.920
 to make pursuit of that goal likely.

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:54.180
 Now that might be surprising,

1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:55.240
 at least it was surprising to me,

1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.800
 you think, well, something is really, really easy,

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.900
 there's a very low bar to achieve it,

1:09:59.900 --> 1:10:01.640
 people are probably more likely to do it,

1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:02.920
 but it turns out that's not the case.

1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:05.000
 When we hear that a goal needs to be inspirational,

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:05.920
 what do we mean?

1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:08.360
 When we hear that something's too easy to recruit our action,

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:09.200
 what do we mean?

1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:12.200
 Well, Balsettia's lab measured systolic blood pressure

1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:14.760
 and found that when goals were too easy

1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:15.960
 for people to attain,

1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:18.200
 they didn't get that increase in systolic blood pressure

1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.680
 and recruitment of the other neural and vascular systems,

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:22.700
 meaning the blood systems and the nervous system,

1:10:22.700 --> 1:10:24.600
 that would place them into ongoing effort,

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:26.000
 and so they quickly gave up.

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.880
 Also, if a goal was too lofty,

1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.440
 if it was too far from their current abilities,

1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:36.240
 it didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure.

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:38.360
 Even if people could get very excited

1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:39.780
 about something mentally,

1:10:39.780 --> 1:10:42.840
 it simply didn't place their body into a state of readiness

1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:44.400
 because it wasn't tangible

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:47.540
 that they could actually perhaps really achieve it.

1:10:47.540 --> 1:10:51.060
 So it turns out that when goals were moderate,

1:10:51.060 --> 1:10:54.200
 when they were just outside of one's immediate abilities,

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:55.440
 or that one felt that, yeah,

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:57.100
 that would take a lot of effort,

1:10:57.100 --> 1:11:00.460
 but it's within range or maybe in range,

1:11:00.460 --> 1:11:02.980
 like maybe I can do it, maybe I can't,

1:11:02.980 --> 1:11:05.940
 then there was a near doubling

1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:08.220
 of the systolic blood pressure in the good sense.

1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:10.240
 It didn't go into the unhealthy range

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:13.640
 and a doubling or more of the likelihood

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:17.000
 that they would engage in the ongoing pursuit

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.400
 of that particular goal.

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:19.760
 So here we're talking about goal setting.

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:23.000
 What we're saying is set goals that are realistic,

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.120
 but that aren't so realistic

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:26.460
 that they're easy.

1:11:26.460 --> 1:11:29.920
 The goals need to be realistic and truly challenging.

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.100
 Don't set goals that are so challenging and so lofty

1:11:33.100 --> 1:11:36.480
 that they crash that blood pressure system

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:37.400
 in the other direction

1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:40.260
 and make you or anyone feel unmotivated.

1:11:40.260 --> 1:11:41.600
 In hearing this, it makes sense,

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.120
 but I don't think I would have predicted it

1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:45.720
 had they not done this very controlled study.

1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:47.780
 I would have thought the loftier the goal,

1:11:47.780 --> 1:11:48.820
 the bigger the goal,

1:11:48.820 --> 1:11:51.280
 the more that it recruits the autonomic system

1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:54.180
 and the more that people are likely to lean into the energy

1:11:54.180 --> 1:11:57.020
 and effort to pursue and attain that goal.

1:11:57.020 --> 1:11:58.040
 I also would have thought

1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:00.740
 that if a goal is really easy to achieve,

1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:04.080
 that it would engage the systems of action

1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:05.160
 in the brain and body enough

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:06.760
 that people would sort of get into motion

1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:07.580
 and pursue that goal.

1:12:07.580 --> 1:12:08.520
 But neither is the case.

1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:12.740
 Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve,

1:12:12.740 --> 1:12:17.160
 but that are not so lofty that they collapse your system

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.440
 and that you feel overwhelmed.

1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:22.200
 And the important thing here is that how we perceive a goal,

1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:24.320
 whether or not we think it's within reach or not,

1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:26.640
 of course, will vary depending on whether or not

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:27.480
 we are rested,

1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:29.480
 depending on whether or not other aspects of our life

1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:30.300
 are going well.

1:12:30.300 --> 1:12:33.000
 I mean, we can think that we are hot on the heels

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.680
 of a lifetime goal and everything's going well.

1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:39.300
 And then there'll be some crisis, interpersonal crisis,

1:12:39.300 --> 1:12:41.560
 or there'll be a health crisis and you'll be shut down.

1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:44.120
 And then that goal seems very, very hard to attain.

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:46.560
 So we will talk about how to update goals

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:48.500
 under different contexts in a few minutes.

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:50.760
 But of course, this is going to be an averaging.

1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:52.680
 This isn't something that you do just once.

1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:54.160
 But the takeaway again is very simple,

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.000
 set goals that are moderately hard to hard,

1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.840
 but not so hard nor so easy that they don't engage

1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:02.360
 your brain and body properly.

1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:06.200
 Moderate goals are best if you want to achieve your goals.

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.400
 Now I'd like to talk about three particular areas

1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:12.180
 of scientific study that point to goal pursuit,

1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:14.220
 goal assessment, and goal achievement.

1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:19.160
 Previously, I told you that it's great

1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:20.540
 to foreshadow failure,

1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:22.120
 that that's a great way to get your system

1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:23.420
 into a state of activation.

1:13:23.420 --> 1:13:26.060
 I also told you that you want to set goals

1:13:26.060 --> 1:13:27.540
 that are challenging, but possible.

1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:29.160
 And again, here, I'm paraphrasing

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:30.680
 from the work of Emily Balsettis.

1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:31.880
 I want to be very clear.

1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:35.640
 There are a few other things that one can do

1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:39.400
 in order to bias the likelihood that you will succeed

1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:41.120
 in trying to achieve your goals.

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:44.520
 First of all, limit your options.

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.800
 Trying to pursue too many goals at once

1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:48.400
 can definitely be counterproductive.

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.760
 Now I realize that life is complicated.

1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:53.240
 We all have multiple goals that we're trying to pursue,

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:56.200
 but if we have particular goals that are important to us,

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:59.280
 we have to be careful to not get distracted by other goals.

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:01.060
 And many people run into this problem.

1:14:01.060 --> 1:14:05.280
 So setting one or two or maybe three major goals

1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:07.800
 for a given year is going to be more than enough

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.020
 for most people and is actually going to be challenging

1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:11.080
 for most people.

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:12.960
 Now, of course, we have daily goals and monthly goals

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.840
 and yearly goals, but if we have big lofty goals,

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:18.680
 we need to be careful not to contaminate our mental space

1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:20.520
 and our visual space with too many goals.

1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:22.240
 And why do I say visual goals?

1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:26.480
 Well, what various department stores and supermarkets

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:31.080
 have discovered is that the greater the number of things

1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.740
 in our visual attention, the more that we can draw

1:14:34.740 --> 1:14:37.640
 our attention and our goals off a line of pursuit.

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:38.760
 What does that mean?

1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:40.640
 Well, let's think about it in the practical context.

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.200
 This has actually been done.

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:44.000
 Big department stores have figured out

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.480
 that if they stock their shelves chock-a-block

1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:50.080
 with many, many options of food or clothing items

1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:52.000
 or objects or anything like that,

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.920
 people simply buy more stuff.

1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:58.720
 People are very prone to orienting their attention

1:14:58.720 --> 1:14:59.820
 to whatever's in front of them.

1:14:59.820 --> 1:15:01.020
 You put a lot of stuff in front of them,

1:15:01.020 --> 1:15:01.880
 their attention drifts.

1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:03.740
 You put fewer things in front of them,

1:15:03.740 --> 1:15:05.960
 their attention is more narrow.

1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:09.040
 In a later episode, we'll talk about designing a workspace

1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:11.080
 that's optimized on the basis of this.

1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:12.920
 It doesn't mean being in a room with nothing

1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:14.760
 except just your desk and a computer.

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.920
 It doesn't have to be that sparse,

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.960
 but visual sparseness actually can help us

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:23.080
 orient our focus and our behavior.

1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:25.080
 When we have a lot of things in our visual environment

1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:27.120
 or a lot of things in our cognitive environment,

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:28.440
 it's the same thing.

1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:30.920
 And so if you're going to try and pursue a fitness goal,

1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:33.060
 a relationship goal, an academic goal,

1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:35.280
 and a long-term life financial goal all at once,

1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:36.440
 that's four things.

1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:38.140
 And you're going to have to come up with systems

1:15:38.140 --> 1:15:42.520
 that allow you to isolate those goals in a very rigid way.

1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:45.040
 And if you do have multiple interleaving goals

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.800
 and overlapping goals and simultaneous goals,

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:49.580
 in a few minutes, we're going to talk about a process

1:15:49.580 --> 1:15:52.080
 that will allow you to use your visual system

1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:55.000
 to align towards each of those goals sequentially

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.840
 in a way that makes it much more likely

1:15:56.840 --> 1:15:57.960
 that you'll achieve them.

1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:01.160
 So now let's talk about specificity of goals.

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:03.680
 We've all heard that the more specific a goal is

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:06.400
 and the more specific we are about when and how

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:08.560
 we are going to execute that goal,

1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:10.840
 the higher probability that we will actually

1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:12.320
 achieve that goal.

1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:13.420
 And indeed that's the case,

1:16:13.420 --> 1:16:16.720
 but there's an additional feature that's not often discussed

1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:18.220
 that is vitally important.

1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:22.120
 And in fact, maybe more important than having a specific

1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:25.080
 time of day or a specific end point in mind.

1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:27.580
 There's a really nice study that was done

1:16:27.580 --> 1:16:29.400
 looking at recycling.

1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:32.120
 And this is something that a number of groups, businesses,

1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:34.680
 households, and individuals are trying to do more of.

1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:37.920
 They're trying to lower carbon footprint or contribute to

1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:41.760
 the world in some general way by throwing away fewer things

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:44.840
 that could potentially be recycled.

1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:46.500
 So this has been studied in the context

1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:50.660
 of the work environment where a business decides

1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:53.800
 and lets everybody know that there's going to be

1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:57.000
 a greater effort toward recycling cans or bottles

1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:58.720
 or bottles and cans, et cetera.

1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:01.440
 And then the way these studies were done is that

1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:04.960
 the janitorial staff was swapped out temporarily

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:07.320
 for researchers that actually measured the number

1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:11.420
 of recyclable items that showed up in the trash

1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:13.280
 and not in the recycle

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:14.800
 as a function of the total amount of trash.

1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:16.340
 Why did I say as a function of the total amount of trash?

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:18.600
 Well, it's a way of controlling for differences

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:20.440
 in beverage consumption from one week to the next.

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:23.640
 Anyway, the point is they were able to very carefully

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:28.240
 measure how much people are recycling before

1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.320
 and after this call to action to recycle more.

1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:33.560
 What they found was if they said,

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:35.480
 we are going to try and recycle more,

1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:38.180
 try not to put cans and bottles in the trash.

1:17:38.180 --> 1:17:41.360
 There of course was an improvement in recycling,

1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:43.260
 but it was pretty modest.

1:17:43.260 --> 1:17:46.580
 Whereas when there was a very concrete plan

1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:48.740
 and everyone knew what that concrete plan was,

1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:51.360
 for instance, to place all bottles and cans

1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:53.320
 into the recycle, not the trash,

1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:57.800
 or to limit the amount of trash by 50%

1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:01.160
 or to eliminate all recyclable items from the trash.

1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:02.920
 So when they made it very concrete,

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:05.880
 exactly what the action steps were,

1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:07.680
 there was a remarkable, I mean,

1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:12.180
 close to a hundred fold or more improvement in recycling

1:18:12.180 --> 1:18:14.840
 behavior that lasted many months

1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:17.600
 after this call to action was made.

1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:19.460
 The takeaway from this is quite straightforward.

1:18:19.460 --> 1:18:22.720
 It means that having a concrete plan is essential.

1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:25.200
 You can't just say, I'm going to become a better recycler,

1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:26.560
 or I'm going to do things that are better

1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:27.380
 for the environment,

1:18:27.380 --> 1:18:29.640
 or I'm going to become more physically fit.

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:33.240
 It has to be a specific set of action steps

1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:35.120
 that get right down to details

1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:37.760
 about what success would look like.

1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:39.040
 I've heard this before described

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:40.840
 as what does right look like?

1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:44.040
 What is the actual outcome that one would like to achieve

1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:45.720
 in terms of action steps?

1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:47.480
 So not necessarily feeling states.

1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:48.840
 It wasn't that they all sat around and said,

1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:50.400
 how great we're all going to feel about ourselves

1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:52.480
 in the world when we accomplish this goal.

1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:54.680
 It was very concrete statements,

1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:57.600
 very concrete plans about action steps

1:18:57.600 --> 1:18:59.520
 that would deliver one to one's goal.

1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:01.520
 Somewhat straightforward and intuitive,

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:03.700
 but nonetheless worthwhile.

1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:05.800
 What it suggests is that for all of us,

1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:08.020
 if we have certain goals that we want to achieve,

1:19:08.020 --> 1:19:10.840
 we need to be exquisitely detailed

1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:13.560
 about what the action steps are that we're going to take

1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:15.900
 and to constantly update those action steps

1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:17.420
 so that we have a higher probability

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:19.200
 of meeting those action steps.

1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:20.460
 Some of you may be asking,

1:19:20.460 --> 1:19:24.240
 how often should one assess progress?

1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:26.320
 Well, that of course will depend on the given goal

1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:27.640
 that you're trying to pursue.

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:30.940
 But in the studies that I've been referring to here,

1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:32.480
 the assessment of progress

1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:35.880
 and the updating of concrete plans was done weekly.

1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:38.760
 So it seems like weekly is a good starting place

1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:42.080
 to address how well one performed in the previous week.

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:43.960
 And then based on that performance

1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:46.680
 to update the action plan for the upcoming week.

1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:49.880
 So weekly seems like a good solid rule of thumb

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:52.560
 for setting particular action goals

1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:54.720
 and assessing one's progress

1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:57.400
 towards the immediate and longer-term goals.

1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:00.360
 Any discussion about goals and goal pursuit

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:02.320
 would be incomplete without a discussion

1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:04.200
 about the molecule dopamine.

1:20:05.160 --> 1:20:07.360
 Dopamine is often thought of as the molecule

1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:09.000
 of pleasure and reward,

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:12.560
 but actually it is the molecule of motivation.

1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:15.580
 This is best illustrated by a classic set of studies

1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:18.640
 that have been carried out in both animals and in humans.

1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:22.060
 The animal study can be described the following way.

1:20:22.060 --> 1:20:24.560
 Two rats, each in a separate cage.

1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:27.000
 You can provide those rats with the opportunity

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.240
 to indulge in something that they like,

1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:34.240
 like food or mating or heat if it's cold in the environment

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:36.740
 or a cool spot in the cage,

1:20:36.740 --> 1:20:39.560
 if it's warm in the environment and so forth.

1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:41.600
 And what you find is that rats

1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:46.160
 will very readily approach the rewarding thing.

1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:47.920
 They will mate, they will eat,

1:20:47.920 --> 1:20:51.880
 they will pursue something that is of pleasure.

1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:54.280
 Now, if you are to take one of those rats

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:56.200
 and deplete its dopamine neurons,

1:20:56.200 --> 1:20:57.780
 you can eliminate its dopamine neurons

1:20:57.780 --> 1:20:59.960
 or block dopamine in the brain.

1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:02.140
 What you find is that those animals

1:21:02.140 --> 1:21:05.720
 will still enjoy pleasure.

1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:08.560
 They will consume the food, they will mate, et cetera.

1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:12.780
 However, their motivation to achieve pleasure

1:21:12.780 --> 1:21:14.720
 is vastly reduced.

1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:17.240
 In fact, if you place the item of pleasure,

1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:19.320
 the mate, the food, et cetera,

1:21:19.320 --> 1:21:22.600
 even just one rat's length away from that rat,

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:25.720
 the rat without dopamine will not even move one length

1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:29.020
 of its own body in order to achieve that pleasure.

1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:31.280
 And there are naturally occurring experiments in humans

1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:34.060
 that mimic that result very accurately.

1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:36.220
 There are certain conditions in humans

1:21:36.220 --> 1:21:37.820
 where there's a depletion of dopamine.

1:21:37.820 --> 1:21:40.820
 And what you find is that the depletion of dopamine

1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:42.740
 does not inhibit an ability

1:21:42.740 --> 1:21:45.100
 to experience pleasure necessarily.

1:21:45.100 --> 1:21:47.460
 It inhibits an ability to pursue

1:21:47.460 --> 1:21:49.880
 or go through the series of action steps

1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:52.080
 in order to achieve pleasure.

1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:54.240
 So dopamine really sits at the heart

1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:57.940
 of our motivational state to seek out goals

1:21:57.940 --> 1:21:59.080
 and to seek pleasure.

1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:01.240
 And this is true for immediate goals

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:04.360
 that take place within a timeframe of minutes

1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:06.760
 or a timeframe of a day or the timeframe of a week

1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:09.000
 or the timeframe of a lifetime.

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:12.960
 Dopamine is the common currency by which we pursue goals.

1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:15.120
 Now, dopamine does a number of things

1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:16.620
 that are very interesting.

1:22:16.620 --> 1:22:17.920
 I'm going to describe a few of them

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:20.720
 as they relate to goal-seeking behavior.

1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:23.560
 First of all, there's a fundamental feature

1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:27.680
 of how our brain releases and uses dopamine

1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:29.640
 that's called reward prediction error.

1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:31.000
 And the simplest way to think about

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.160
 dopamine reward prediction error

1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:36.760
 is that dopamine is released in the greatest amount

1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:40.440
 and places us into a greater state of motivation

1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:44.640
 when something happens that's positive and novel.

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.840
 Now, an important thing to understand about dopamine

1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:51.520
 is that it's not always released on the same schedule.

1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:53.600
 There are a couple of different ways that dopamine is released

1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:57.640
 and when it is released relative to your anticipation

1:22:57.640 --> 1:22:59.180
 of a reward is key.

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:03.000
 If you don't expect something positive to happen,

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:04.220
 you're just going about your day

1:23:04.220 --> 1:23:05.920
 and something positive happens,

1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:09.400
 dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released.

1:23:09.400 --> 1:23:10.560
 I had this happen recently.

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:13.120
 I had no idea that I was going to be receiving

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:16.080
 something in the mail, but I went to the mail,

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:18.720
 I looked in the mail and I got something very positive

1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:20.440
 and I was really, really excited about it.

1:23:20.440 --> 1:23:23.080
 This is a real event that happened just today.

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:26.880
 However, if we anticipate something positive

1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:29.740
 is going to happen and then that thing happens,

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:34.320
 we experience dopamine as part of the anticipation.

1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:36.460
 So even before we get the reward,

1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:38.280
 there's an increase in dopamine.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:41.840
 It's not as high as it would be if something really novel

1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:43.720
 and unexpected and positive happened,

1:23:43.720 --> 1:23:45.440
 but we do get an increase in dopamine.

1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:49.340
 And then when we actually experience the reward,

1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:51.100
 we experienced the positive thing,

1:23:51.100 --> 1:23:53.360
 there's a smaller increase in dopamine.

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:55.320
 So again, the biggest increases in dopamine

1:23:55.320 --> 1:23:59.520
 are response to things that are positive and unexpected.

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:01.880
 Lesser dopamine is released

1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:04.840
 when we anticipate something good will happen.

1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:07.280
 And when that happens, yes, we get some dopamine

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:08.560
 and we also get some dopamine

1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:09.720
 when the positive thing happens.

1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:12.020
 Think about anticipating a great meal with friends.

1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:14.360
 We have some dopamine churning, friends come over,

1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:15.400
 then we have the meal

1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:16.920
 and we also get some dopamine from that,

1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:19.160
 but not nearly as much as we would

1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:22.480
 if it had all happened as a part of a big surprise.

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:24.920
 Then there's also the case in which we predict

1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:27.100
 that something good will happen.

1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:29.160
 When that happens, there's an increase in dopamine

1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:30.640
 just as there was before.

1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:32.200
 But then if that thing doesn't happen,

1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:34.300
 for instance, our friends don't show up for dinner,

1:24:34.300 --> 1:24:38.400
 then there's a drop in dopamine below our initial baseline.

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:41.240
 That drop in dopamine is the chemical essence

1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:43.600
 of what we call disappointment.

1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:47.660
 Now, this dopamine reward prediction error, as it's called,

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:50.920
 can be leveraged toward trying to reach our goals

1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:55.440
 because it tells us where we should set our milestones.

1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:58.680
 We can't be in a mode of simply being focused

1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:00.240
 on the finish line.

1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:04.340
 Very few people can do that over long periods of time

1:25:04.340 --> 1:25:05.400
 in a way that's effective.

1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:06.760
 Now, earlier I talked about a study

1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:09.080
 where people were focused on a finish line visually

1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:10.400
 and they were moving through space

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:11.560
 with these ankle weights on,

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:13.780
 but that was a very short-term goal, okay?

1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:16.280
 So if a goal is within minutes

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:17.840
 or maybe even within an hour or is in

1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:20.360
 with our immediate visuals environment,

1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:21.600
 maybe we can do that.

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:24.460
 But most goals of the sort that most people are pursuing,

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:26.320
 fitness goals, academic goals, business goals,

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:29.940
 relationship goals, et cetera, involve some milestones.

1:25:29.940 --> 1:25:34.280
 So understanding what we know about reward prediction error,

1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:35.840
 we can make better choices

1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:37.920
 about where to place the milestones,

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:41.200
 how far out in the future to place milestones.

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:43.440
 So then the question becomes how often

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:47.240
 or at what intervals should one assess progress?

1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:49.100
 And it turns out this is very subjective,

1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:51.760
 but that there's a way to make it objective.

1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:56.280
 Now, in a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:58.960
 I had a discussion with the great Robert Sapolsky,

1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:01.360
 and we were talking about how the brain

1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.540
 can subjectively change whether or not a given behavior

1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:06.520
 or experience is positive or negative.

1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:10.400
 And the example that Robert gave is a really phenomenal one.

1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:13.140
 It's a study that's been done in rats and also in humans,

1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:15.740
 where it took a rat, they had a rat run on a running wheel.

1:26:15.740 --> 1:26:18.720
 Rats, turns out, like to run on running wheels.

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:20.840
 And the blood pressure of that animal,

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:23.800
 the health metrics for that animal, the lipid profiles,

1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:25.680
 many, many things improved, okay?

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:27.480
 The rat was exercising and it got healthier

1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:28.560
 and presumably got happier.

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:29.400
 We don't know.

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:31.380
 We could have asked it, but we wouldn't know.

1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:33.700
 Doesn't know how to tell us, but we can measure blood lipids.

1:26:33.700 --> 1:26:36.160
 We can measure blood pressure and all sorts of things.

1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:38.720
 And indeed, when that rat exercised

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:42.080
 or when people exercise, they generally get healthier.

1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:44.240
 Except in that particular experiment,

1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:49.240
 they had another animal where every time rat number one ran,

1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:53.480
 rat number two was forced to run.

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:55.440
 It was on a running wheel and it was forced to run,

1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:58.640
 not because it wanted to, but because it was forced to.

1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:01.720
 And what was remarkable is that the physiological effects

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:03.720
 of being forced to do something

1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:06.560
 were in the complete opposite direction as they were

1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:09.560
 when those same behaviors were undertaken voluntarily.

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:12.200
 In other words, the rat that was choosing to run

1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:15.400
 got healthier and the rat that was forced to run

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:16.480
 became unhealthy.

1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:18.100
 Blood pressure went up in a direction

1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:19.720
 that wasn't effective and useful.

1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:20.880
 Blood lipids got worse.

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.880
 Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera.

1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:25.040
 And you see the same thing in humans.

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:29.920
 Now, what this says is that our subjective understanding

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:33.840
 of why we are doing something is fundamentally important

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:36.560
 for the effects that we will get from that behavior.

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:39.560
 And indeed the effects that that behavior will have on us.

1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:41.480
 So this has two major implications.

1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:44.040
 First of all, in terms of reward schedules,

1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:46.560
 we can decide to use any reward schedule

1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:48.420
 that we want for a given behavior.

1:27:48.420 --> 1:27:51.600
 We can decide that the milestones for a,

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:53.120
 let's say a plan of getting

1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:56.080
 in really terrific cardiovascular shape over the next year,

1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:00.440
 we can decide to assess every day and ask ourselves,

1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:01.560
 how good was our progress?

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:02.560
 And if we made progress,

1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:03.760
 then we're going to reward ourselves.

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:05.400
 We could do that every third day.

1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:06.760
 We could do it every week.

1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:08.140
 We could do it every five minutes

1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:10.200
 if we actually have the time to do that.

1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:12.760
 The reward schedule, the dopamine system

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:15.960
 is highly susceptible to the subjective effects,

1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:18.640
 the so-called top-down effects of when we decide

1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:20.640
 that something is going to be good for us,

1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:23.160
 if we analyze it on a given timeframe,

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:25.320
 well, then it's going to be good for us.

1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:29.020
 So what I suggest people do is pick a particular interval

1:28:29.020 --> 1:28:31.040
 at which they are going to assess progress.

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:34.320
 And if you've been making regular progress towards a goal

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:37.000
 that you reward yourself and the reward indeed

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.320
 is all cognitive, it's all mental.

1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:42.100
 It's telling yourself, yes, I'm on the right track.

1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:44.320
 Now, some people will say, wait,

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:46.760
 but I want to know exactly how often I should do that.

1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:49.040
 You need to do that at an interval

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:51.600
 that you can maintain consistently, okay?

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:54.440
 So you're not going to reward yourself every minute

1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:56.880
 or every step of every jog that you take,

1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:58.760
 unless you can do it every minute of every step

1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:00.040
 of every jog that you take.

1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:02.720
 For that reason, I think that daily

1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:05.800
 or ideally weekly assessments are going to be best.

1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:07.360
 I think that checking in at the end of a week,

1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:08.840
 looking back on the previous week

1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:11.120
 and assessing how well you performed

1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:12.740
 in pursuit of a given goal,

1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:15.760
 how many times a week you ran or how many times you studied

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:17.760
 or how many times you did something that you wanted to do

1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:19.760
 or avoided something that you didn't want to do.

1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:24.300
 I think that's a reasonable and tractable schedule

1:29:24.300 --> 1:29:26.640
 to assess once a week.

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:29.840
 So that's one point that pick a milestone

1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:32.900
 that you can maintain consistently throughout the pursuit

1:29:32.900 --> 1:29:33.880
 of a goal.

1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:37.560
 The second thing is that the subjective effects

1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:40.080
 that were described by that Sapolsky study

1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:44.840
 or that Sapolsky described rather are absolutely essential

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:47.360
 for all aspects of goal-seeking behavior.

1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:49.440
 We cannot underestimate the extent

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:51.040
 to which the dopamine system

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:53.520
 and our sense of whether or not we are on the right track

1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:56.020
 is under our cognitive control.

1:29:56.020 --> 1:29:58.440
 If we constantly place ourselves

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:01.380
 into a mode of thinking that we are failing,

1:30:01.380 --> 1:30:02.880
 well, then indeed,

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:05.000
 we are not going to churn out much dopamine.

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:08.880
 Now, earlier I said we need to predict and visualize failure

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:10.680
 but that is not the same thing

1:30:10.680 --> 1:30:13.280
 as thinking about ourselves as failing.

1:30:13.280 --> 1:30:16.960
 We need to predict what the outcome would be if we failed,

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:20.560
 but then encountering that and in behaving in a certain way

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:21.560
 and thinking in a certain way

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:24.720
 and pursuing our goals in an effective way,

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:26.480
 maybe checking in on that each week,

1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:29.620
 we definitely need to reward ourselves cognitively

1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:32.680
 for the correct and successful pursuit.

1:30:32.680 --> 1:30:35.640
 What this means is that anticipate and think about failure

1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:38.080
 as a mechanism of generating motivation

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.620
 and indeed fear and anxiety

1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:41.560
 so that you lean into the correct behaviors

1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:43.640
 and you lean away from the incorrect behaviors

1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:44.800
 to reach your goal.

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:46.500
 But then weekly or so,

1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:48.700
 whatever you can maintain consistently,

1:30:48.700 --> 1:30:51.500
 you absolutely want to reward yourself cognitively

1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:53.480
 by telling yourself, I'm on the right track.

1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:56.260
 I got another week where I accomplished whatever it is

1:30:56.260 --> 1:30:57.800
 that I'm trying to accomplish.

1:30:57.800 --> 1:30:59.560
 A concrete example that I'm following now

1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:02.520
 is this 150 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week

1:31:02.520 --> 1:31:04.280
 because that's shown to be very effective

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:07.540
 in improving mental and physical health metrics.

1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:09.200
 So once a week, I'll check in with myself.

1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:13.240
 If I reach that 150 to 200 minute threshold,

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:15.780
 then I'll reward myself simply by checking off a box

1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:19.020
 and saying, okay, I'm on track, I'm on track, I'm on track.

1:31:19.020 --> 1:31:22.160
 This dopamine system is critical to re-up,

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:24.000
 to remind ourselves that we are on track

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:25.680
 if indeed we are on track

1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:30.040
 because dopamine itself provides a state of motivation

1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:31.640
 and readiness to continue

1:31:31.640 --> 1:31:33.480
 in the regular pursuit of our goals.

1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:38.280
 Dopamine, the molecule is actually used

1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:40.800
 to manufacture epinephrine and norepinephrine,

1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:43.000
 which are other molecules in our brain and body,

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.420
 which put us into that readiness and action state.

1:31:45.420 --> 1:31:47.200
 They're actually the molecules that help generate

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:49.280
 that increase in systolic blood pressure

1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:51.860
 that puts us into a state of readiness.

1:31:51.860 --> 1:31:55.760
 So you can think about dopamine as a self amplifying system

1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:59.640
 provided that you are leveraging the dopamine system

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:01.800
 on a consistent schedule.

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:05.180
 Now, by also following a consistent schedule of self reward,

1:32:05.180 --> 1:32:09.600
 you set yourself up for any positive unanticipated rewards

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:10.560
 that may happen.

1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:13.400
 So for instance, if you're checking in with yourself weekly,

1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:15.800
 telling yourself that you're doing well, if indeed you are,

1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:19.140
 and then out of nowhere, for instance, you're out on a run

1:32:19.140 --> 1:32:21.280
 or you're doing something, I'm using fitness as an example,

1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:22.120
 but you're doing something,

1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:24.200
 you find yourself performing particularly well,

1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:26.960
 that's a unexpected dopamine reward

1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:29.380
 that will further amplify the system.

1:32:29.380 --> 1:32:31.000
 Now, I know many people out there

1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:32.960
 having heard me talk about dopamine before,

1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:35.340
 worry, well, can I release too much dopamine

1:32:35.340 --> 1:32:36.760
 and then the whole system will crash

1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.520
 and then I'll run out of motivation.

1:32:38.520 --> 1:32:40.320
 In general, that doesn't happen

1:32:40.320 --> 1:32:42.560
 unless people are using pharmacology,

1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:44.360
 supplements or prescription drugs

1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:46.640
 or illicit drugs to increase dopamine.

1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:50.000
 This is why I'm a big fan of things like cold showers

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.520
 and cold water exposure which has been shown

1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:57.480
 to lead to long lasting 2.5X increases in dopamine

1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.560
 or in some cases, supplementation with things

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:01.960
 like L-tyrosine which are precursors to dopamine

1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:03.880
 or in some cases, caffeine which can increase

1:33:03.880 --> 1:33:05.960
 the number of dopamine receptors that we have

1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:08.080
 so that whatever dopamine we have floating around

1:33:08.080 --> 1:33:10.000
 can be more effective in activating

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:11.920
 these motivational states.

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:14.920
 But things that really increase dopamine

1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:17.480
 and then cause it to crash can be problematic.

1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:19.120
 One way to conceive of dopamine

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:21.400
 is as a sort of dopamine wave pool.

1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:22.640
 You've probably seen these wave pools

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.920
 where some pressure is pushed into the pool

1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:26.380
 and then you get these waves going.

1:33:26.380 --> 1:33:29.280
 If those waves are consistent enough

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:31.040
 and they're of high enough amplitude,

1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:35.120
 the waves can continue to go up and down and up and down.

1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:36.560
 But if it's a giant wave,

1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:39.000
 if you get a huge blast of dopamine,

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.840
 well, then a bunch of the water sloshes

1:33:40.840 --> 1:33:42.800
 out of the wave pool and then you basically have

1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:45.780
 to take some time off, reset that dopamine level.

1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:47.000
 That's what happens in addiction

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.800
 and when people start pushing in a lot of drugs

1:33:50.800 --> 1:33:51.900
 or other things into the system

1:33:51.900 --> 1:33:53.840
 that increase dopamine too much.

1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:55.840
 So today we've almost exclusively been talking

1:33:55.840 --> 1:33:57.720
 about behavioral tools.

1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:00.680
 It is possible to incorporate supplements

1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:02.520
 and things of that sort that can increase dopamine

1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:06.120
 as a way to getting into ongoing motivational states.

1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:09.800
 But I caution people about relying on those too much.

1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:12.520
 Really what you want is you want a situation

1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:14.500
 where your own positive feedback,

1:34:14.500 --> 1:34:16.300
 your own understanding that you are reaching

1:34:16.300 --> 1:34:19.160
 the milestones that you've set out for yourself,

1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:20.640
 that you're achieving those

1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:22.520
 and that is what's causing these waves

1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:23.840
 or these increases in dopamine

1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:26.880
 that will further amplify your motivational states.

1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:29.280
 Another very interesting aspect of dopamine

1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:32.360
 that I've not talked about at all on this podcast before

1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:34.440
 is actually how the dopamine system

1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:36.680
 interacts with the visual system.

1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:38.360
 We've talked a lot about how harnessing

1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:41.420
 your visual attention to a particular point is great

1:34:41.420 --> 1:34:45.740
 and can help serve your ability to both set

1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:46.960
 and achieve goals.

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:50.820
 Really wonderful work that was done by Wolfram Schultz,

1:34:50.820 --> 1:34:53.680
 who's one of the great pioneers in this area of dopamine

1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:55.720
 and dopamine reward prediction error,

1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:58.880
 showed that for people that have normal levels of dopamine,

1:34:58.880 --> 1:34:59.960
 their visual search,

1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:01.720
 meaning how they scanned visual environments

1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:03.020
 tends to be pretty constrained.

1:35:03.020 --> 1:35:04.420
 They might move their eyes around

1:35:04.420 --> 1:35:07.060
 a particular visual environment searching somewhat.

1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:10.740
 For people that lack dopamine,

1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:13.320
 they actually have very little movement of their eyes.

1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:16.320
 They don't actually tend to look very far into the horizon.

1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:18.660
 They don't have that very focused vergence point

1:35:18.660 --> 1:35:19.960
 that we're talking about that kind of,

1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:21.200
 I guess for lack of a better phrase,

1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:23.460
 that kind of eye of the tiger focus on a goal,

1:35:23.460 --> 1:35:26.720
 rather their eye movements are depleted

1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:29.160
 and they're not actually evaluating horizons

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:30.080
 off in their future.

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:34.080
 They're not focused so much on the extra personal space.

1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:36.400
 And this actually can be restored in some of these

1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:38.360
 that took place in Parkinson's patients

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:40.360
 and other people who have dopamine depleted,

1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:43.480
 that when dopamine is restored pharmacologically,

1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:46.880
 their visual focus is re-enhanced again.

1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:48.720
 Now, there are a lot of details to this study

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:50.280
 that don't map perfectly onto everything

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:51.200
 that I've talked about.

1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:52.680
 But the point is this,

1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:55.920
 when we are focused on a particular point in visual space

1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:59.060
 or a particular goal or horizon,

1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:01.800
 all those systems, our blood pressure, epinephrine,

1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:03.880
 and indeed dopamine get recruited

1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:06.600
 to put us into a state of readiness and willingness

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:10.000
 to go pursue things in that extra personal space.

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.200
 When our visual attention is very diffuse,

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:15.880
 all of that relaxes and we tend to be more comfortable

1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:19.920
 staying in the place that we are in our peripersonal space.

1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:23.020
 And the effect works in the other direction too.

1:36:23.020 --> 1:36:24.780
 When dopamine is increased,

1:36:24.780 --> 1:36:26.820
 our visual attention for particular things

1:36:26.820 --> 1:36:28.300
 out in space increase.

1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:30.920
 So the way it works is reciprocal.

1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:34.040
 When we use our visual system in a particular way,

1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:35.220
 bring it to a point of focus,

1:36:35.220 --> 1:36:37.240
 it recruits chemical and neural systems

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:38.080
 in our brain and body

1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:40.840
 that put us into a state of readiness and pursuit.

1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:45.360
 And when we increase certain chemicals in our brain and body

1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:47.300
 like epinephrine, like dopamine,

1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:50.440
 then we also allow our visual system

1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:54.100
 to be in a state of looking out at particular locations

1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:55.260
 in our visual world.

1:36:55.260 --> 1:36:57.440
 So the system works in both directions.

1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:00.320
 And some people leverage this by using things like caffeine

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:03.040
 or taking things like L-tyrosine to increase dopamine.

1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:04.520
 And again, it works both ways.

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:06.380
 There's no right or wrong way to do it.

1:37:06.380 --> 1:37:09.580
 I'm a particular fan of using behavioral tools

1:37:09.580 --> 1:37:12.900
 always prior to using supplementation

1:37:12.900 --> 1:37:14.380
 or any kinds of other tools

1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:16.900
 because behavioral tools have a very unique feature

1:37:16.900 --> 1:37:20.260
 that supplementation and other chemical tools don't,

1:37:20.260 --> 1:37:23.260
 which is that behavioral tools used over time

1:37:23.260 --> 1:37:25.040
 engage neuroplasticity.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.600
 As we start to practice using our visual system

1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:29.680
 to harness our attention to particular locations

1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:31.920
 and in that way move toward particular goals,

1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:34.120
 we get better and better at using those systems.

1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:36.840
 In fact, the systems for focus and motivation

1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:38.140
 themselves have plasticity.

1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:40.940
 So we get better at being motivated and focused

1:37:40.940 --> 1:37:44.380
 when we place our visual attention at a given location.

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.080
 Using chemical assistance of a safe kind,

1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:48.220
 of course, check with your doctor,

1:37:48.220 --> 1:37:50.800
 but things like L-tyrosine or caffeine or those combined,

1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:52.280
 yes, it will increase dopamine

1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:53.840
 and will increase our ability

1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:56.000
 to engage in visual focus somewhat.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.480
 But those compounds alone don't modify the circuitry

1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:00.480
 in the way that we want.

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:02.840
 So I always say behavioral tools first,

1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:05.040
 then nutritional tools, then supplementation tools,

1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:06.940
 and then if it's right for you and safe,

1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:08.340
 maybe you advance into some of the other

1:38:08.340 --> 1:38:09.920
 more sophisticated tools.

1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:11.380
 I'd like to just briefly recap

1:38:11.380 --> 1:38:13.020
 what I've covered up until now.

1:38:13.020 --> 1:38:14.960
 And again, emphasize that much of what I've covered

1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.380
 has been based on the beautiful work

1:38:16.380 --> 1:38:18.220
 of Emily Balcetas and colleagues.

1:38:18.220 --> 1:38:21.360
 I do hope to get her as a guest on the podcast, by the way.

1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:24.480
 First of all, set goals that are challenging but possible.

1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:27.780
 Those moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult,

1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:29.720
 but moderately challenging goals

1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:31.200
 seem to be the most effective

1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:33.160
 in moving people towards their goals

1:38:33.160 --> 1:38:34.700
 over the short and long term.

1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:36.840
 Second, plan concretely.

1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:38.280
 You need a concrete set of actions

1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.800
 that you're going to follow in order to reach your goals.

1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:44.180
 Third, foreshadow failure.

1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:46.560
 This is a somewhat surprising one to me.

1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:49.400
 I would have anticipated that imagining success

1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:50.780
 is the way to go.

1:38:50.780 --> 1:38:53.960
 It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success

1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:56.360
 can be useful at the outset of a goal

1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:59.580
 and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal,

1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:02.140
 but that it's not terrific for putting you

1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:04.100
 in constant pursuit of that goal.

1:39:04.100 --> 1:39:06.840
 Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure

1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:09.120
 and all the terrible things that it's going to bring

1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:11.140
 seems to be more effective and that maps very well

1:39:11.140 --> 1:39:12.640
 to what's known about the neural circuitry

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:14.440
 and the involvement of the amygdala.

1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:18.280
 Focus on particular visual points

1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:22.320
 as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors.

1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:25.780
 Removing distractors and getting your body and brain

1:39:25.780 --> 1:39:27.200
 into a mode of activation,

1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:29.720
 getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure

1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:32.520
 that puts you into forward motion towards your goals

1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:33.920
 is absolutely key.

1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:35.360
 So that's a brief summary

1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:37.080
 of what I've covered up until now.

1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:38.460
 There were other things too, of course,

1:39:38.460 --> 1:39:43.340
 the dopamine system and the power of subjective

1:39:43.340 --> 1:39:46.960
 top-down control in regulating that dopamine system.

1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:49.680
 But I want to be sure to include a tool

1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:51.580
 that's been especially powerful for me,

1:39:51.580 --> 1:39:53.800
 that's grounded in the neuroscience research

1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:55.680
 and in the psychology research.

1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:57.840
 And as I describe this tool next,

1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:00.840
 I think you'll see the ways in which it meshes nicely

1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:04.400
 with the work that Emily Balcetas and colleagues have done.

1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:06.880
 This is something that I've personally been doing

1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:08.880
 for many years based on my understanding

1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:11.800
 of the visual system and the understanding

1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:16.080
 that indeed we can move our cognition and our perception

1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:18.920
 from a place of interoception

1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:21.360
 and focusing on our peripersonal space,

1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:23.880
 that space within us and immediately around us

1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:27.120
 and on the things that are immediately accessible to us,

1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:28.720
 that we can shift from that mode

1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:32.120
 to this mode of exteroception of focusing on things

1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:34.440
 outside the confines of our skin

1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:36.080
 and that are beyond our reach,

1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:38.180
 that are literally goal-directed behaviors

1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:40.120
 and goal-directed thoughts.

1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:42.060
 And this is something that in the past

1:40:42.060 --> 1:40:43.880
 I've talked about a little bit

1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:46.040
 and I've talked about something called space-time bridging.

1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:48.360
 And we haven't talked too much about the time domain

1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.180
 of the visual system today,

1:40:50.180 --> 1:40:53.440
 but space-time bridging is simply a way

1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:55.300
 of using one's visual system

1:40:55.300 --> 1:40:58.560
 to focus on the peripersonal space and interoception

1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:00.720
 and then gradually in a deliberate way,

1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:04.080
 stepping one's focus into the extra personal space

1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:06.160
 and then back to the peripersonal space

1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:09.860
 in a way that gives you a lot of flexibility and control

1:41:09.860 --> 1:41:13.240
 over that ability in your daily life.

1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:15.580
 So I'm going to first describe the tool

1:41:15.580 --> 1:41:18.400
 and then I will explain more about the underlying science

1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:19.840
 and the underlying mechanism.

1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:22.780
 Here's how you would do this.

1:41:22.780 --> 1:41:25.680
 You could do this indoors or outdoors,

1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:28.360
 although ideally you would do it in a location

1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:29.580
 where you could view a horizon.

1:41:29.580 --> 1:41:30.520
 It could be through a window

1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:33.140
 or ideally outdoors without a window.

1:41:33.140 --> 1:41:34.340
 It could be done any time of day.

1:41:34.340 --> 1:41:36.160
 At night, it might be a little more challenging,

1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:38.520
 but it goes the following way.

1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:41.760
 What you first do is you would close your eyes.

1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:43.140
 This could be done seated or standing,

1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:44.480
 but you would close your eyes

1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:48.720
 and you would focus as much of your attention,

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:51.820
 including your visual attention on your inner landscape,

1:41:51.820 --> 1:41:52.980
 on your interoception.

1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:54.820
 So that would be your breathing, your heart rate,

1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:56.220
 maybe even the surface of your skin,

1:41:56.220 --> 1:41:57.960
 but really focusing internally.

1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:00.120
 Now, how can you focus your visual attention internally

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.240
 if your eyes are closed?

1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:04.880
 Well, you do that by imagining your inner landscape, okay?

1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:06.440
 So you don't have to imagine your heart beating

1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:07.560
 and so forth, but what you're trying to do

1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:10.200
 is eliminate perception of the outside world.

1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:11.800
 You're eliminating exteroception

1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:14.860
 and you're focusing all of your cognitive attention

1:42:14.860 --> 1:42:16.200
 and your perceptual attention

1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:19.640
 on what you're experiencing within the confines of your skin

1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:21.980
 or at the level of the surface of your skin

1:42:21.980 --> 1:42:23.120
 and inside your body.

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:25.860
 And you would do that for a duration

1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:29.280
 of approximately three slow breaths, okay?

1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:30.200
 So close your eyes.

1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.440
 You would do breath one, breath two, and breath three,

1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:37.320
 concentrating all your attention on your internal landscape.

1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:39.480
 Then you would open your eyes

1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:41.120
 and you would focus your visual attention

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.440
 on some area on the surface of your body.

1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:44.920
 So for me, the way that I typically do this

1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:47.400
 will be to focus on, say, the palm of my hand.

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:49.560
 So I'll focus my visual attention on the palm of my hand.

1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:52.960
 And I then do three breaths again,

1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:55.140
 focusing on my internal state,

1:42:55.140 --> 1:42:58.220
 but now I'm splitting out a little bit of my attention

1:42:58.220 --> 1:43:00.200
 from interoception to exteroception.

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:01.960
 I'm focusing on something outside me.

1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:05.640
 The ratio or the split of attention is about 90-10.

1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:08.420
 About 90% of my attention is focused internally,

1:43:08.420 --> 1:43:12.640
 but I'm also focusing some of my attention externally.

1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:14.560
 Most people can do this pretty easily.

1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:17.040
 Then there's a third, what I call station.

1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:20.640
 I now move my visual attention to outside my body,

1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:22.240
 to some location in the room,

1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:24.020
 or if I'm outside in the external environment,

1:43:24.020 --> 1:43:26.800
 something in the range of five to 15 feet away.

1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:29.960
 And I'm trying to move 90% of my attention

1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:31.160
 to that external object.

1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:33.240
 So now I'm really biasing my perception

1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:35.800
 and my attention towards exteroception.

1:43:37.540 --> 1:43:39.800
 As I breathe, I'm paying attention to those three breaths.

1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:41.160
 So that's why there's still 10%

1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:43.000
 that's focused on my internal landscape,

1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.040
 because I want to pay attention to those three breaths,

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:49.160
 but I'm focusing as much of my attention outside of myself,

1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:51.700
 maintaining just a little bit on my internal state

1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:55.140
 so I can measure the cadence of those three breaths.

1:43:55.140 --> 1:43:58.000
 Then I move my visual attention to yet another station,

1:43:58.000 --> 1:43:58.840
 which is further away,

1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:00.520
 typically a horizon or something

1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:03.340
 as far off in the distance as I can possibly see,

1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:06.680
 again, for the duration of three breaths.

1:44:06.680 --> 1:44:10.520
 And at that point, I'm trying my very best to move 99,

1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:14.420
 if not 100% of my attention to that external location.

1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:18.720
 And then what I typically will do

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:23.720
 is I will try and expand both my vision and my cognition

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:25.120
 to a much broader sphere.

1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:26.580
 This is that magnocellular vision

1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:28.060
 that we talked about before,

1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:30.080
 where I'm not focusing on a particular location

1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:30.920
 on the horizon,

1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:33.000
 I'm trying to dilate the aperture of my field of view

1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.360
 so I can see as much of the visual landscape

1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:36.740
 as I'm in as possible.

1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:39.520
 If you're in an internal, excuse me,

1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:42.740
 if you're in indoors, then that might be the ceiling,

1:44:42.740 --> 1:44:45.040
 the walls, and the floor of the environment you're in.

1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:45.880
 If you're outdoors,

1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:47.720
 it would be to expand your visual focus

1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:50.000
 as broadly as you possibly can,

1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.300
 again, for the duration of three breaths.

1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:56.880
 Then I would return immediately to my internal landscape.

1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:59.760
 I would close my eyes and I would do three more breaths

1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:03.080
 focusing entirely on my interoception,

1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:05.120
 on my internal landscape,

1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:07.960
 what we call before my peripersonal space.

1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:12.800
 And I would then repeat that peripersonal space, 100%.

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:15.480
 Focused on my hand, 90%,

1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:18.760
 10% on my peripersonal space or my internal landscape.

1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:20.460
 Stepping out to another location

1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:22.600
 where it's mostly exteroception,

1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:25.600
 maybe a little bit of recognition of my internal state.

1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:28.540
 Then to the horizon, then to this broader visual sphere,

1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:29.640
 then back into my body.

1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:31.880
 And I would work through each of those stations

1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:33.160
 maybe two or three times.

1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:36.580
 The entire thing takes about 90 seconds to three minutes,

1:45:36.580 --> 1:45:38.580
 depending on how many breaths you do.

1:45:38.580 --> 1:45:41.000
 I said three, but you could do one or 10,

1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.480
 it doesn't really matter.

1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.060
 Or it's also going to depend on, for instance,

1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:47.400
 how slowly you're breathing,

1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:49.060
 because your breathing might be faster than mine

1:45:49.060 --> 1:45:49.960
 or vice versa.

1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:52.140
 What is all of this doing?

1:45:52.140 --> 1:45:54.240
 Why do I call this space time bridging?

1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:56.560
 And why is this useful for goal setting?

1:45:56.560 --> 1:45:58.680
 The reason I call it space time bridging

1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:03.080
 is that the visual system is not just about analyzing space,

1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:05.280
 it's actually how we batch time.

1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:06.840
 It's how we carve up time.

1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:08.260
 And the simple way to state this

1:46:08.260 --> 1:46:10.480
 is that when we focus our visual attention

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:14.800
 on a very narrow point that's close to our body

1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:16.400
 and our immediate experience,

1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.200
 we tend to slice up time very finely.

1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:20.840
 We're focused on our breathing.

1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:22.800
 We're focused on our heartbeats.

1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:25.040
 In fact, our breathing and our internal landscape

1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:27.560
 and our heartbeats become the sort of seconds hand,

1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:29.480
 if you will, on our experience.

1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:30.780
 We are carving up time

1:46:30.780 --> 1:46:34.280
 according to our immediate physiological experience.

1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:37.960
 Whereas when we focus our visual attention outside our body,

1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:40.640
 not only do we engage that exteroceptive

1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:42.120
 extra personal space system,

1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:43.880
 and we start to engage the dopamine system,

1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:45.780
 the goal-directed system,

1:46:45.780 --> 1:46:49.280
 but we also start batching time differently.

1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:50.900
 When we focus our visual system

1:46:50.900 --> 1:46:52.680
 into a broader sphere of space

1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:55.480
 or into a space beyond the confines of our skin,

1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:59.220
 we start carving up time, our frame rate changes.

1:46:59.220 --> 1:47:02.480
 Now, this is useful in the context of goal setting,

1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:04.200
 goal assessment, and goal pursuit,

1:47:04.200 --> 1:47:09.200
 because with the exception of a very few isolated examples,

1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:13.920
 almost all goals involve setting some goal

1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:15.600
 that's off in the future,

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.940
 and then carving up the time between now

1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:19.760
 and the achievement of that goal

1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:23.160
 into milestones that range in duration.

1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:24.640
 And the rewards,

1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:26.640
 even if we try and just make them every week,

1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:29.720
 are going to come at some unexpected intervals.

1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:32.200
 And that's actually can be helpful for reinforcing behavior.

1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:35.440
 Intermittent reward that's intermittent and random

1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:37.860
 is the most effective reward schedule we know.

1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:40.600
 But the problem is always,

1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:43.880
 how do we keep our cognition in line with the long-term goal

1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:46.400
 while also being focused on these more immediate goals?

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:47.840
 And so this particular practice

1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:49.120
 that I call space-time bridging,

1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:50.520
 but we could give it a different name.

1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:51.520
 I'm sure there are better names.

1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:52.400
 Maybe you can suggest some

1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:54.520
 in the comment section on YouTube

1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.300
 that are more accurate or more mapped to it better.

1:47:57.300 --> 1:48:00.280
 But this behavior, or this practice, rather,

1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:02.720
 is teaching us to use our visual system

1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:04.640
 and thereby our cognitive system

1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:07.200
 and thereby our reward systems

1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:09.800
 to orient to different locations in space

1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:12.840
 and therefore at different locations in time.

1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:16.280
 And that is the essence of goal-directed behavior.

1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:18.500
 That is the essence of setting a goal.

1:48:18.500 --> 1:48:20.480
 It's about thinking about what you want.

1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:23.360
 Then it's about setting milestones

1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.680
 that are intermediate to that goal.

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:26.960
 Then it's about assessing

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:28.840
 whether or not you're reaching those milestones.

1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:31.200
 And then it's, of course, about updating your goals

1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:32.980
 if you need to update your goals.

1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:37.020
 All of that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges

1:48:37.020 --> 1:48:38.640
 if you think about it all at once.

1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:40.780
 But if you break it down into these elements

1:48:40.780 --> 1:48:43.080
 that the visual system can help you find

1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:44.600
 and move towards those milestones,

1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:46.560
 I think there's ample evidence to support that,

1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:49.160
 and that your control over your visual system

1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:50.100
 is indeed yours,

1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:52.360
 that you can deliberately set it to different locations,

1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:54.500
 and then you make a practice

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:57.380
 of stepping through these different stations

1:48:57.380 --> 1:48:58.340
 on a regular basis.

1:48:58.340 --> 1:48:59.760
 Again, I do this each morning.

1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:01.000
 I do this once a day.

1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:03.560
 Rarely have I done it twice a day.

1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:04.960
 Rarely have I missed a day.

1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:07.520
 But by doing that, you can be very effective

1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:09.920
 in teaching the systems of your brain

1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:11.880
 that are related to goal setting and reward

1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:13.880
 to map to different timeframes.

1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:16.920
 So I found this to be a very effective protocol.

1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:21.720
 The Balsettis work has mainly focused on visual tools

1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:23.560
 that are of a single horizon.

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:24.960
 Here, I'm talking about multiple,

1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:27.200
 what I called stations or horizons.

1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:30.360
 But what's very clear is that an ability to move

1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.320
 from different visual stations,

1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:34.400
 and to do that in a deliberate way,

1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:36.740
 in a focused and conscious way,

1:49:36.740 --> 1:49:40.280
 clearly maps to an ability to conceive of different goals

1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:41.840
 over different periods of time,

1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:44.320
 and I do believe can be greatly beneficial

1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:47.120
 in allowing one to set particular goals

1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:49.400
 and then move through the milestones to those goals,

1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:52.400
 and to constantly update one's pursuit and reward

1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:53.680
 in reaching those milestones,

1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:55.920
 and eventually the overall goal.

1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:58.040
 Per usual, I covered a lot of material today.

1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.400
 We talked about some of the neuroscience and psychology

1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:05.420
 and popular understanding of goal-seeking behavior,

1:50:05.420 --> 1:50:07.400
 how to assess goals, et cetera.

1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:09.320
 Talked about the beautiful work of Emily Balsettis

1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:12.680
 at New York University and her work

1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:16.640
 on the use of the visual system to better achieve goals.

1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:19.380
 And indeed, things like visualization

1:50:19.380 --> 1:50:21.560
 and why forecasting failure can be more effective

1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:23.120
 than forecasting success,

1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:25.360
 as counterintuitive as that might seem,

1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:26.920
 that's what the data point to.

1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:29.760
 And we talked about the importance of setting concrete plans

1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:31.400
 and really what that means,

1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:34.840
 and what intervals at which to assess progress,

1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:37.520
 and what intervals at which to assess reward

1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.560
 and how the dopamine system is involved.

1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:41.640
 And in addition, I described this practice

1:50:41.640 --> 1:50:45.600
 that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice

1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:46.920
 of so-called space-time bridging,

1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:49.320
 of using the visual system and your ability

1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:51.780
 to deliberately step your visual system

1:50:51.780 --> 1:50:54.280
 from stations that are within your body,

1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:57.120
 so-called peripersonal or interoceptive space,

1:50:57.120 --> 1:50:58.640
 out into the world further and further,

1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:00.400
 and then back again in sequence,

1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:02.920
 as a way to harness and cultivate

1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:07.700
 and build up these systems that link vision, space, time,

1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:09.800
 reward systems, and so forth.

1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:13.400
 Ultimately, as you set out to accomplish your goals,

1:51:13.400 --> 1:51:15.640
 there are going to be a number of basic steps

1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:16.880
 that everyone will have to follow.

1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:18.320
 You'll have to clearly identify

1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:20.640
 what the long-arching ultimate goal is.

1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:23.880
 You'll have to identify what the milestones will be.

1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:25.480
 You might not know all of them at the outset,

1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:27.680
 but you ought to have some idea about the intervals

1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:30.980
 at which you are going to set those milestones

1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:35.120
 and set your reward schedule for assessing progress

1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:37.960
 in route to those milestones and your ultimate goal.

1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:40.540
 My hope is that you'll be able to incorporate these tools,

1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:44.120
 if not all of them, perhaps just one of them or two of them,

1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:46.200
 in pursuit of whatever particular goals

1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:49.880
 you happen to be focused on at this point and in the future.

 That's perhaps the best way to support this podcast.

1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:21.800
 And in addition, we have a Patreon.

1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:24.400
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:26.720
 and there you can support the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:28.280
 at any level that you like.

1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:29.120
 In today's episode,

1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:31.200
 and in previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:32.680
 we talked about supplements.

1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:34.780
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:52:34.780 --> 1:52:36.920
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:39.400
 for things like sleep and focus and so forth.

1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:40.760
 It's really important that if you're going to take

1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:43.880
 supplements, that they be of the absolute highest quality.

1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:46.520
 For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-I-N-E,

1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:48.780
 because Thorne supplements have the highest levels

1:52:48.780 --> 1:52:51.200
 of stringency with respect to the ingredients they include

1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:53.360
 and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients

1:52:53.360 --> 1:52:55.120
 they include in their products.

1:52:55.120 --> 1:52:56.880
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

1:52:56.880 --> 1:53:01.880
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

1:53:01.900 --> 1:53:03.480
 and you can see the supplements that I take

1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:05.780
 and get 20% off any of those supplements.

1:53:05.780 --> 1:53:08.040
 And if you navigate further into the Thorne site

1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:10.980
 through thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:13.640
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:14.800
 that Thorne makes.

1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:16.560

1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:19.160
 on Instagram and or Twitter, please do so.

1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:22.040
 There I teach neuroscience and neuroscience related tools

1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:24.360
 that sometimes overlap with the content of the podcast,

1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:27.480
 but oftentimes is unique from the content of the podcast.

1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:29.120
 Also, if you haven't already done so,

1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:30.920
 please subscribe to the Huberman Lab

1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:32.640
 neural network newsletter.

1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:35.040
 The neural network newsletter is a monthly

1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:38.920
 zero cost newsletter where I very succinctly spell out

1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:41.440
 or list out protocols for things like sleep,

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:44.860
 learning, neuroplasticity, and other topics as well.

1:53:44.860 --> 1:53:47.540
 You can go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,

1:53:47.540 --> 1:53:50.320
 go to newsletter, it's a simple signup.

1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:52.800
 We will not give out your email information to anybody.

1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:55.360
 All our privacy policy is there, again at zero cost

1:53:55.360 --> 1:53:57.880
 and the tools that are there very cleanly spell out

1:53:57.880 --> 1:53:59.560
 a number of the protocols that you can hear about

1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:00.820
 on the podcast.

1:54:00.820 --> 1:54:03.280
 And in closing, I want to thank you once again

1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:07.400
 for joining me in this discussion about the biology science

1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:10.400
 and in particular, the neuroscience of goal setting,

1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:13.220
 goal assessment, and achieving goals.

1:54:13.220 --> 1:54:15.780
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:54:15.780 --> 1:54:17.720
 thank you for your interest in science.
