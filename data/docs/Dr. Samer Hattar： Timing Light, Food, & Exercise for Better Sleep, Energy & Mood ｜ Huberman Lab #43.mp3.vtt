00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.240
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.240 --> 00:15.520
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.800
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Samir Hattar

00:18.800 --> 00:21.600
 as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.680
 Dr. Hattar is the chief of the section

00:23.680 --> 00:25.600
 on light and circadian rhythms

00:25.600 --> 00:27.560
 at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:27.560 --> 00:29.500
 in Bethesda, Maryland.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.120
 Dr. Hattar has many important discoveries to his name.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.720
 He was one of a handful of groups

00:34.720 --> 00:38.440
 that discovered the light-sensing neurons in the eye

00:38.440 --> 00:40.560
 that set the circadian clock.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.620
 This was a fundamental discovery made in the early 2000s

00:44.620 --> 00:48.160
 that has led to an enormous number of additional discoveries

00:48.160 --> 00:52.120
 on how light regulates our sleep, our immune system,

00:52.120 --> 00:56.440
 our mood, mental health, metabolism, feeding,

00:56.440 --> 00:59.360
 and many other important processes.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.160
 If ever there was somebody who understands

01:01.160 --> 01:03.680
 how all of these processes interact

01:03.680 --> 01:07.600
 and can inform best practices for our daily behaviors,

01:07.600 --> 01:09.160
 it's Dr. Hattar.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.460
 During our discussion today,

01:10.460 --> 01:13.780
 Dr. Hattar answers questions that are absolutely essential

01:13.780 --> 01:16.840
 for us to know about our health and wellbeing.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.280
 For instance, how to align our sleep schedule

01:20.280 --> 01:22.920
 with our activity schedule, such as exercise,

01:22.920 --> 01:26.720
 and how to align light activity and exercise

01:26.720 --> 01:28.760
 with our feeding rhythms.

01:28.760 --> 01:33.040
 He presents a new model of how light activity

01:33.040 --> 01:36.240
 and feeding rhythms converge to support optimal health,

01:36.240 --> 01:39.220
 and when those are not aligned correctly,

01:39.220 --> 01:41.960
 how our mental and physical health can suffer.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.240
 It's a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism,

01:45.240 --> 01:48.280
 made clearly, of course, so everybody can understand,

01:48.280 --> 01:51.720
 as well as specific protocols to deal with shifts

01:51.720 --> 01:54.280
 in day length, shifts in activity,

01:54.280 --> 01:57.720
 and in order to optimize sleep, metabolism,

01:57.720 --> 01:59.600
 and wellbeing of various kinds.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.200
 I learned so much from Samir, as I always do.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.520
 He is an absolute wealth of knowledge

02:04.520 --> 02:07.280
 on all things related to light and circadian rhythms,

02:07.280 --> 02:09.320
 physiology, and neuroscience.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.720
 I don't think you'll find anyone else

02:10.720 --> 02:13.040
 as knowledgeable about these topics as Samir,

02:13.040 --> 02:15.920
 and so I'm delighted that he joined us here on the podcast

02:15.920 --> 02:17.460
 to share this information.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.920
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:19.920 --> 02:22.720
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.760
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:24.760 --> 02:27.400
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:27.400 --> 02:30.000
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
 In keeping with that theme,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.120
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.960
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.120
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

02:38.120 --> 02:40.440
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.160
 I've spent my career working on the science

02:42.160 --> 02:44.440
 of the visual system, and I can tell you that one

02:44.440 --> 02:46.700
 of the things that our visual system has to contend with

02:46.700 --> 02:49.880
 is adjusting so that when we go from a very bright area

02:49.880 --> 02:53.180
 to a dim or shadowed area, we can still see things clearly.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.520
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed

02:55.520 --> 02:57.360
 with the science of the visual system in mind,

02:57.360 --> 02:59.080
 and so they make those transitions seamless.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.360
 You always see things with crystal clarity.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.760
 Another great thing about these glasses

03:02.760 --> 03:03.880
 is that they're very lightweight,

03:03.880 --> 03:06.160
 so you don't even really remember that they're on your face,

03:06.160 --> 03:09.840
 and they won't slip off if you get sweaty.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.760
 The glasses were designed initially for running

03:12.760 --> 03:15.080
 and for cycling and for active wear,

03:15.080 --> 03:17.840
 but they work great for that, and they work great,

03:17.840 --> 03:21.120
 and they also happen to look great for work,

03:21.120 --> 03:22.760
 if you go out to dinner, for social settings,

03:22.760 --> 03:25.960
 so they can really be worn in essentially any circumstances.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.600
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses, you can go to Roca,

03:36.820 --> 03:39.800
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.300
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

03:42.300 --> 03:44.880
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

03:44.880 --> 03:46.620
 to help you better understand your body

03:46.620 --> 03:48.660
 and help you reach your health goals.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.680
 I've long been a believer in getting blood work done

03:51.680 --> 03:54.040
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

03:54.040 --> 03:56.240
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

03:56.240 --> 03:59.720
 can only be detected in a quality blood test.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.800
 The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,

04:01.800 --> 04:03.700
 is you get numbers back, but you don't know what to do

04:03.700 --> 04:05.420
 about those numbers specifically.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.860
 Roca solved that problem at a number of levels.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.480
 First of all, they make getting the blood tests very easy.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.600
 They'll come to your house if you like,

04:11.600 --> 04:12.960
 you can go to a local clinic.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.060
 Second of all, once you get your numbers back,

04:16.060 --> 04:18.320
 there's a very easy to use dashboard

04:18.320 --> 04:21.360
 where you can identify obviously what the numbers are,

04:21.360 --> 04:22.820
 but also the various things that you can do

04:22.820 --> 04:25.700
 to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want

04:25.700 --> 04:28.560
 through either behavioral practices like exercise,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.440
 through nutritional practices or supplementation, et cetera.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.220
 So they made the whole thing very easy start to finish

04:34.220 --> 04:37.640
 in a way that allows you to best direct your health goals.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.040
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

04:39.040 --> 04:41.640

04:46.800 --> 04:49.780
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.

04:49.780 --> 04:54.360
 Magic Spoon is a zero sugar grain-free keto friendly cereal.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.160
 I am not ketogenic,

04:56.160 --> 04:58.560
 meaning I don't follow a purely ketogenic diet.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.800
 I tend to fast in the early part of the day.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.560
 I tend to eat kind of low carb-ish

05:02.560 --> 05:04.040
 through the middle of the day.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.800
 And then in the evening I eat carbohydrates.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.280
 That's what works best for me

05:07.280 --> 05:09.300
 and allows me to feel alert all day long

05:09.300 --> 05:11.800
 and to sleep really well at night.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.900
 Magic Spoon is a terrific snack for me

05:13.900 --> 05:15.560
 because it tastes terrific.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.680
 It's got some sweetness,

05:16.680 --> 05:18.800
 but it doesn't take me out of that state

05:18.800 --> 05:20.060
 that I want to be in during the day

05:20.060 --> 05:22.000
 where I'm sort of keto-ish, I would say.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.600
 I'm not actually in ketosis,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.820
 but I'm following more or less a low carb diet

05:25.820 --> 05:27.640
 during the day, which keeps me alert.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.900
 So either fasting or low carb,

05:28.900 --> 05:31.060
 and Magic Spoon is consistent with that.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.760
 And then as I mentioned before in the evening,

05:32.760 --> 05:34.860
 I do eat carbohydrates.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.280
 Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,

05:37.280 --> 05:39.020
 13 to 14 grams of protein,

05:39.020 --> 05:41.840
 and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.680
 So I think it qualifies as low carb-ish or low carb.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.080
 In addition, it only has 140 calories per serving.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.340
 It's also just delicious.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.320
 They have flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter,

05:52.320 --> 05:54.600
 frosted, I particularly like the frosted one

05:54.600 --> 05:55.720
 because it tastes like donuts

05:55.720 --> 05:57.160
 and I particularly like donuts,

05:57.160 --> 05:59.920
 although I try not to eat them too often, if ever.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.440
 If you want to try Magic Spoon,

06:01.440 --> 06:04.360

06:13.200 --> 06:15.960
 and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.640
 And now my conversation with Dr. Samer Hatar.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.240
 Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.080
 My pleasure.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.440
 Yeah, we go way back.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.760
 So you are best known in scientific circles

06:28.760 --> 06:32.320
 for your work on how light impacts mood,

06:32.320 --> 06:37.040
 learning, feeding, hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.400
 So just to kick the ball out onto the field, so to speak,

06:42.780 --> 06:45.600
 how does light impact the way we feel?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.740
 So when I get up in the morning,

06:47.740 --> 06:49.760
 I have the opportunity to interact with light

06:49.760 --> 06:52.220
 in certain ways or to avoid light in certain ways.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.120
 I have the opportunity to interact with sunlight

06:54.120 --> 06:56.000
 or with artificial light.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.560
 Maybe you could just wade us into what the relationship is

07:00.560 --> 07:02.640
 between light and these things

07:02.640 --> 07:04.080
 like mood and hunger, et cetera.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.200
 Sure.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.080
 So I mean, you do appreciate the effect of light for vision.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.840
 So when you wake up in a beautiful area, beautiful ocean,

07:13.840 --> 07:15.240
 light is essential.

07:15.240 --> 07:20.120
 The sunrise, the sunset, blue sky, beautiful mountains.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.140
 So that's your conscious perception of light.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.720
 But light has a completely different aspect

07:25.720 --> 07:28.360
 that is independent of conscious vision

07:28.360 --> 07:30.480
 or image-forming functions.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.120
 And that's how it regulates

07:32.120 --> 07:34.680
 many important functions in your body.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.940
 I think the best that is well-studied and well-known

07:37.940 --> 07:39.960
 is your circadian clock.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.680
 And the word circadian comes from the word circa,

07:42.680 --> 07:45.200
 which is approximate, and dn is day.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.600
 So it's an approximate day.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.520
 Why is it an approximate day?

07:48.520 --> 07:51.080
 Because if I put you or any other human being

07:51.080 --> 07:54.920
 who have a normal circadian clock in a constant conditions

07:54.920 --> 07:58.900
 with no information about feeding time, about sleep time,

07:58.900 --> 08:01.080
 about what time it is outside,

08:01.080 --> 08:02.880
 you still have a daily rhythm,

08:02.880 --> 08:04.800
 but it's not exactly 24 hours.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.000
 So it will shift out of the solar day

08:08.000 --> 08:09.840
 because it's not exactly 24 hours

08:09.840 --> 08:11.340
 and hence the name circadian.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.400
 So just to ask a quick question about that,

08:13.400 --> 08:17.760
 when you say you have this about 24-hour rhythm,

08:17.760 --> 08:20.820
 how does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our body?

08:20.820 --> 08:22.520
 Great, so great question.

08:22.520 --> 08:26.200
 So it shows up at every level that we know we studied.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.480
 It shows up at the level of the cell,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.320
 it shows up at the level of the tissue,

08:30.320 --> 08:32.120
 and it shows up at your behavior.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.360
 The most obvious for you is your sleep-wake cycle.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.680
 You sleep and you're awake and sleep at the 24-hour rhythms.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.720
 And if you measure the sleep-wake cycle

08:41.720 --> 08:44.520
 of humans who are maintained in constant conditions,

08:44.520 --> 08:47.040
 you will see that the period length of the sleep rhythm,

08:47.040 --> 08:49.640
 on average, is more than 24 hours.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.840
 In humans, it's 24.2 hours.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.240
 So you'll be drifting.2 hours every day

08:55.240 --> 08:57.540
 out of the solar day if you don't get the sunlight.

08:57.540 --> 09:01.520
 So the sunlight adjusts that approximate day

09:01.520 --> 09:05.040
 to an exact day, so now your behavior is adjusted

09:05.040 --> 09:08.020
 to the light-dark environment or the solar day.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.640
 Okay, so if I understand correctly,

09:09.640 --> 09:12.280
 if I were to go into a cave or I were to be

09:12.280 --> 09:15.880
 in constant light and I didn't close my eyes

09:15.880 --> 09:19.040
 in constant light, that I would still sleep

09:19.040 --> 09:22.540
 in one coherent bout and I would still be awake

09:22.540 --> 09:25.520
 for more or less one coherent bout, maybe a nap.

09:25.520 --> 09:30.520
 But the total duration of my day, so to speak,

09:31.300 --> 09:34.840
 would be a little bit longer than 24 hours.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.860
 But if I'm in a condition like most people are,

09:37.860 --> 09:40.040
 where the sun goes up and the sun goes down

09:40.040 --> 09:43.120
 and I have some understanding of that sunrise and sunset.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.840
 You don't have to have the understanding.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.580
 You don't have to have conscious understanding.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.160
 You have the detection.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.680
 So circadian photoentrainment is the word we use

09:51.680 --> 09:55.260
 in training the circadian clock to the photic environment.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.920
 It's completely subconscious.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.100
 You're not aware of it.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.760
 It's not like vision or image forming

10:00.760 --> 10:02.840
 where you actually know what you're looking at.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.400
 So it's all hypothalamic.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.540
 It's part of the brain that is not consciously driven.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.740
 So you actually do not know when it happens

10:10.740 --> 10:11.700
 or when it doesn't happen.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.120
 And that's what we'll get into when I tell you

10:14.120 --> 10:16.400
 why light affects your mood and why sometimes

10:16.400 --> 10:18.160
 people don't know how to deal with light

10:18.160 --> 10:20.240
 to improve their mood, for example.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.320
 Okay, so this is a subconscious vision.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.160
 Yes.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.440
 Okay.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.640
 Before you tell us about how light impacts mood,

10:26.640 --> 10:30.200
 I'm curious, what is the relevance of adjusting

10:30.200 --> 10:33.200
 this clock from a little bit longer

10:33.200 --> 10:35.040
 than 24 hours to 24 hours?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.440
 I mean, it seems like a small difference.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.000
 24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.400
 Like, what's the relevance?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.320
 I mean, why should we care about that short difference?

10:44.320 --> 10:45.400
 So let's do the math.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.560
 If you shift out 0.2 hours a day,

10:47.560 --> 10:49.520
 in five days you're shifting out one hour.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.120
 So you're literally one hour off

10:52.120 --> 10:54.480
 in your social behavior in five days.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.560
 In 10 days, you're two hours off.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.600
 And if you're an organism that is living in the wild,

10:59.600 --> 11:02.100
 shifting out of the right phase of the cycle,

11:02.100 --> 11:04.920
 you could either miss food or you could become food.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.000
 So it's really essential for survival.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.600
 I think it's one of the strongest aspects of survival

11:10.600 --> 11:13.680
 for animals to have the anticipation

11:13.680 --> 11:16.440
 and the adjustment to the solar cycle.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.840
 And for humans as well, when you say animals,

11:18.840 --> 11:20.160
 I'm assuming that applies to us.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.200
 Absolutely, yeah.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.040
 I see.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.640
 So even though it's just a short bit longer than 24,

11:25.640 --> 11:28.320
 if that accumulates over days,

11:28.320 --> 11:30.880
 then you could find yourself very much out of phase

11:30.880 --> 11:33.560
 with the rest of your species, essentially.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.400
 So let's say it's 0.2 hours.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.840
 So in five days, it's one hour.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.440
 In 25 days, it could be five or six hours.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.280
 You could be in New York and you're feeling

11:43.280 --> 11:45.200
 as if you traveled from New York to London.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.380
 So you will be having jet lag in New York,

11:48.380 --> 11:50.800
 even though you didn't do a jet lag travel.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.680
 So it's very important for the adjustment.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.960
 And if we have time, maybe we could talk about

11:55.960 --> 11:58.000
 why this is important for seasonality,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.660
 because also it allows animals to anticipate

12:00.660 --> 12:02.320
 the change in season.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.320
 And the more you're high in the north or the south,

12:06.320 --> 12:10.240
 the more that these weather changes occur very harshly

12:10.240 --> 12:12.120
 and you have to be ready for them.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.080
 And that happens in us as well.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.920
 All right, we will definitely get into seasonality.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.560
 Okay, so we've got this subconscious vision

12:20.560 --> 12:24.480
 that aligns us with the turn of the earth.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.680
 How does that work?

12:25.680 --> 12:30.680
 What is the machinery that allows that to happen?

12:30.680 --> 12:33.880
 And how does that machinery work?

12:33.880 --> 12:37.000
 Yeah, so we knew that in mammals, including us,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.560
 we are mammals, humans,

12:38.560 --> 12:40.520
 that the eyes are required for this function.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.340
 So if humans are born without eyes

12:43.340 --> 12:45.400
 or the optic nerves are damaged,

12:45.400 --> 12:48.840
 humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.080
 So we know that the eyes are required.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.840
 And since we thought we knew about the eyes a lot

12:53.840 --> 12:55.880
 before 2000, we thought that-

12:55.880 --> 12:57.320
 What did you say, before the year 2000?

12:57.320 --> 12:59.040
 Before the year 2000, yes.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.700
 We thought it's these photoreceptors in your retina

13:02.700 --> 13:03.720
 that allow you to see.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.640
 So in the human retinas,

13:05.640 --> 13:08.160
 there are two types of photoreceptors.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.400
 They are called rods and cones because of their shapes.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.400
 And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy,

13:14.400 --> 13:16.080
 which light is made of,

13:16.080 --> 13:18.680
 and they change it in a way to an electrical signal

13:18.680 --> 13:22.400
 that allow us to build the image of the environment

13:22.400 --> 13:23.500
 in our cortices.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.560
 Subconsciously?

13:24.560 --> 13:26.960
 Consciously, in this situation, because it's vision, right?

13:26.960 --> 13:30.280
 It's image-forming vision, it's a visual cortex

13:30.280 --> 13:32.560
 and associative cortices,

13:32.560 --> 13:34.600
 which allow you to build conscious perception

13:34.600 --> 13:36.360
 of the environment.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.900
 However, people have found,

13:38.900 --> 13:41.320
 including me with the work of David Berson

13:41.320 --> 13:42.520
 and Ignacio Provencio,

13:42.520 --> 13:45.560
 that there is a subset of ganglion cells.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.800
 The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina,

13:48.800 --> 13:51.760
 their axon, leave the retina, and project to the brain.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.400
 So these words are stored to only relay

13:54.400 --> 13:56.800
 rod and cone information from the light environment

13:56.800 --> 13:58.080
 to the brain.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.520
 We found that a small subset of these ganglion cells

14:01.520 --> 14:04.760
 are themselves photoreceptors that were completely missed

14:04.760 --> 14:06.020
 in the retina.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.080
 And these are the photoreceptors

14:08.080 --> 14:11.160
 that relay light environment subconsciously

14:12.080 --> 14:15.020
 to the areas in the brain that have and house

14:15.020 --> 14:18.100
 the circadian clock or the circadian pacemaker,

14:18.100 --> 14:20.560
 which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies

14:20.560 --> 14:23.840
 to the central brain clock that allows them to entrain

14:23.840 --> 14:27.400
 to the 24 hour light dark cycle.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.240
 Incredible.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.040
 So in the year, as I recall,

14:30.040 --> 14:31.520
 because I was a graduate student at the time,

14:31.520 --> 14:34.420
 in the year 2000, there was this landmark discovery

14:34.420 --> 14:37.960
 made by you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson, and others,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.320
 that these cells exist that can communicate

14:40.320 --> 14:42.680
 day and night information to the brain

14:42.680 --> 14:45.440
 in this very small subset of cells.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.200
 Since then, I've heard, but maybe you can confirm or refute,

14:49.200 --> 14:52.880
 that this system that connects the eyes

14:52.880 --> 14:54.340
 to the rest of the brain

14:54.340 --> 14:56.300
 is actually the most ancient form of vision,

14:56.300 --> 14:58.200
 that this is probably the form of vision

14:58.200 --> 15:01.480
 that some early version of human beings had

15:01.480 --> 15:03.080
 before they had pattern vision,

15:03.080 --> 15:05.200
 before they could see colors and shapes and motion

15:05.200 --> 15:06.420
 and all that.

15:06.420 --> 15:11.340
 And that the same cells that perform this role

15:11.340 --> 15:14.820
 are actually similar to insect eyes.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.480
 I think I heard David Berson say once

15:16.480 --> 15:19.040
 that we actually have a little bit of the fly eye

15:19.040 --> 15:19.860
 in our eye.

15:19.860 --> 15:20.880
 What's he talking about?

15:20.880 --> 15:23.460
 Yeah, so it's really interesting, actually,

15:23.460 --> 15:27.040
 because these same IPRGCs we discovered,

15:27.040 --> 15:29.520
 they contribute a little bit to image formation

15:29.520 --> 15:31.360
 and now work from Tiffany Schmidt,

15:31.360 --> 15:34.160
 specifically have proven that they do contribute

15:34.160 --> 15:36.240
 to image forming functions.

15:36.240 --> 15:41.160
 But they contribute to very limited aspect

15:41.160 --> 15:42.000
 of image formation.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.640
 So it fits your hypothesis

15:43.640 --> 15:45.800
 that these are an ancient photoreceptors.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.640
 The other thing that adds to that hypothesis

15:48.640 --> 15:50.140
 is that they are expressed in cells

15:50.140 --> 15:52.040
 that don't have any modification

15:52.040 --> 15:54.080
 that make them look like photoreceptors.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.300
 So the photoreceptors that I told you about

15:56.300 --> 15:59.800
 that are important for vision, image formation,

15:59.800 --> 16:02.360
 they have very specialized structures

16:02.360 --> 16:04.640
 that allow them to pack these structures

16:04.640 --> 16:05.780
 with photopigments.

16:05.780 --> 16:09.040
 These are the photo detecting proteins.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.120
 So they could detect a high sensitivity of photons

16:12.120 --> 16:13.640
 that pass through them.

16:13.640 --> 16:18.160
 These new photoreceptors don't have

16:18.160 --> 16:20.400
 these specialized structures.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.440
 So they just really need a lot of light at the time.

16:24.440 --> 16:28.080
 We thought they need a lot of light to be activated.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.080
 So that's why we think they are ancient

16:30.080 --> 16:33.400
 and that's why I think they adjust to ancient functions

16:33.400 --> 16:36.760
 that are as important as regulating your body,

16:36.760 --> 16:39.240
 circadian clock to the solar environment,

16:39.240 --> 16:42.160
 to solar day or to the light cycle.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.280
 So you mentioned IPRGCs, intrinsically photosensors.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.040
 So these are cells that connect the eye of the brain

16:47.040 --> 16:49.320
 that behave like photoreceptors, essentially.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.680
 And then you mentioned melanopsin,

16:51.680 --> 16:54.560
 which is the actual pigment that converts the light

16:54.560 --> 16:57.520
 into the electrical signal, more or less.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.200
 And my understanding is that melanopsin

17:00.200 --> 17:04.140
 was identified first in frog melanophores.

17:04.140 --> 17:06.080
 So does that mean that we have like little pieces

17:06.080 --> 17:08.000
 of frog skin in our eyes?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.940
 So honestly, David Berson say you have a fly in your eye

17:10.940 --> 17:12.460
 because it sounds better.

17:12.460 --> 17:15.520
 The more accurate I think is that you have a frog skin

17:15.520 --> 17:17.600
 in your eye, it's not as catchy.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.920
 But really melanopsin, really the name melanopsin

17:20.920 --> 17:23.240
 is from melanocyte opsin.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.360
 So it's melanopsin because it was found

17:25.360 --> 17:26.680
 in the frog melanocytes.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.280
 You know the frogs can change their color depending on light

17:30.280 --> 17:32.720
 and melanopsin drives this response.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.920
 So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered

17:35.920 --> 17:39.240
 these opsins in frogs, luckily he was smart enough

17:39.240 --> 17:41.720
 to see if they are expressed in the frog eye.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.340
 They were expressed in the frog eye

17:43.340 --> 17:45.840
 and it what appears to be retinal ganglion cells,

17:45.840 --> 17:48.480
 which I told you the one that connect the eye to the brain.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.040
 He had the insight to go and see if they are expressed

17:51.040 --> 17:54.400
 in the monkey eye and he found that they are also expressed

17:54.400 --> 17:56.760
 in what appears to be retinal ganglion cells.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.480
 And really that what opened the field wide open.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.920
 Then David Berson did the seminal experiment

18:02.920 --> 18:07.200
 where he went to the brain where the central oscillator,

18:07.200 --> 18:09.840
 the oscillator that drives circadian rhythm in the brain

18:09.840 --> 18:11.840
 called the suprachiasmatic nucleus

18:11.840 --> 18:15.800
 that has been known for many years to receive retinal input.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.360
 And he labeled the cells that project there

18:18.360 --> 18:21.320
 and then he found that even if you destroy rods and cones,

18:21.320 --> 18:23.560
 you could get light responses from these cells.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.380
 So you could imagine he nearly fainted

18:26.380 --> 18:29.760
 when he saw that these cells can respond independent,

18:29.760 --> 18:32.720
 completely in the absence of rod and cone input.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.840
 Yeah, I'll never forget reading those papers in 2000, 2001.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.520
 I was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio,

18:40.520 --> 18:43.720
 we call him Iggy, showed this image of this,

18:43.720 --> 18:47.200
 basically what is frog melanophores in the human eye.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.700
 And everyone was like, oh my goodness, this is the thing.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.960
 And I want to get into how light actually

18:52.960 --> 18:55.240
 can control circadian rhythms at the moment.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.320
 But I think it's worth mentioning now

18:57.320 --> 19:00.120
 that people who are pattern vision blind,

19:00.120 --> 19:03.960
 so people who cannot see and no conscious vision,

19:03.960 --> 19:07.620
 but have eyes, many of them still have these cells,

19:07.620 --> 19:10.080
 these melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells

19:10.080 --> 19:14.240
 and can essentially match or entrain, as we say,

19:14.240 --> 19:16.000
 onto the light dark cycle.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
 In fact, they possibly have no problems

19:18.000 --> 19:19.400
 in circadian photo entrainment.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.560
 They'll have enormous sleep-wake cycle.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.580
 But they're totally blind.

19:22.580 --> 19:24.160
 But they are totally image blind.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.620
 And what's really interesting is that,

19:26.620 --> 19:28.480
 and this story I heard from Chuck Sizler,

19:28.480 --> 19:29.800
 so I'll give him credit,

19:29.800 --> 19:32.200
 that some of these people who are image blind,

19:32.200 --> 19:35.620
 usually they get dry eyes and they give them a lot of pain.

19:35.620 --> 19:39.240
 And doctors used to think, oh, since they are image blind

19:39.240 --> 19:40.400
 and they're getting dry eye,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.060
 why don't you just remove their eyes?

19:42.060 --> 19:43.640
 They're not using them anymore.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.960
 And the minute they would remove their eyes,

19:45.960 --> 19:48.200
 they start having cyclical sleep problems,

19:48.200 --> 19:50.720
 indicating that now they are not entraining

19:50.720 --> 19:54.600
 to the light dark cycle and are having cyclical jet lags

19:54.600 --> 19:57.960
 when their clock shifts through the light dark cycle.

19:57.960 --> 19:58.920
 That's really interesting.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.480
 And I hear from a number of blind people,

20:02.480 --> 20:04.560
 in my various aspects of my job,

20:04.560 --> 20:08.160
 and a lot of them have issues with sleep, I think,

20:08.160 --> 20:09.960
 in part because they don't realize

20:09.960 --> 20:11.540
 that they too need to see light

20:11.540 --> 20:13.160
 at particular times of day or night

20:13.160 --> 20:15.840
 in order to match their schedule.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.280
 Well, I think that's a perfect segue for us

20:18.280 --> 20:22.280
 to talk about how light and viewing light

20:22.280 --> 20:24.560
 can impact our sleep-wake rhythms.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.120
 And then we will move into some of the other ways

20:27.120 --> 20:30.320
 in which light can impact other forms of bodily function.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.240
 Yeah, so I love the way you set it up

20:33.240 --> 20:37.240
 because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect

20:37.240 --> 20:40.520
 of trying to educate people about light effect

20:40.520 --> 20:43.800
 on subconscious vision is that it's subconscious.

20:43.800 --> 20:47.200
 So we're all aware of what we think is intensity

20:47.200 --> 20:48.580
 because we see the room.

20:48.580 --> 20:52.400
 But if you talk to people who know how to take photographs

20:52.400 --> 20:53.560
 and stuff like that,

20:53.560 --> 20:56.140
 they know that the intensity varies greatly.

20:56.140 --> 20:59.100
 But our system, because we have to see the same way

20:59.100 --> 21:02.140
 in very bright conditions and very dim conditions,

21:02.140 --> 21:06.080
 we're not very good at estimating intensity consciously.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.440
 So when you try to tell people about intensity,

21:08.440 --> 21:11.580
 you really struggle because they think they know intensities

21:11.580 --> 21:12.680
 but they really don't.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.700
 You mean light intensity.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.760
 Light intensity.

21:14.760 --> 21:18.880
 So that the cones themselves have an incredible ability

21:18.880 --> 21:21.480
 to adapt to different light conditions.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.520
 So you can see at all different conditions,

21:23.520 --> 21:24.880
 otherwise it'd be a disaster.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.000
 You know, if you don't change the setting on your camera

21:28.000 --> 21:30.040
 and you go from inside the room to the outside,

21:30.040 --> 21:32.640
 it becomes completely white, you don't see anything.

21:32.640 --> 21:36.000
 So if your cones don't adapt to the environment,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.560
 then you're not gonna be able to see in this room

21:38.560 --> 21:41.000
 and on the beach, right?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.200
 But the problem is your IPRGCs,

21:44.200 --> 21:46.400
 the cells that we talked about,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.600
 they measure intensity pretty well.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.380
 They really know what intensity is.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.240
 They have a very good linear measurement of intensity.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.880
 They don't adapt as well,

21:54.880 --> 21:58.480
 they don't adapt actually that much, to be honest.

21:58.480 --> 22:03.320
 So that tells you that subconsciously the system is used

22:03.320 --> 22:06.520
 to measuring light intensity in a natural environment.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.800
 Because when you're in a natural environment,

22:08.800 --> 22:12.120
 you don't have industrialized lighting,

22:12.120 --> 22:15.520
 then your system is functioning very well.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.140
 But now when we change these environments,

22:18.140 --> 22:19.640
 we could really mess up ourselves.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.440
 So you have to teach people how to understand intensity.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.960
 And that's something that you have to explain to people.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.960
 And I think I love to do it myself.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.240
 I do it in what is called the lowest amount of light

22:31.240 --> 22:33.520
 required to allow you to see comfortably.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.460
 So you have to do this as a fun experiment.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.760
 Okay, so explain to me how this goes.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.600
 And maybe we could break it up in the day

22:40.600 --> 22:42.880
 into three or four parts.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.720
 So let's say, assuming that most people wake up

22:45.720 --> 22:48.560
 in the morning, as opposed to night shift workers, et cetera,

22:48.560 --> 22:49.680
 we could talk about later.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.500
 But they wake up in the morning,

22:51.500 --> 22:52.880
 so let's divide the day into quarters.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.040
 What is the proper way to interact with light

22:57.040 --> 22:59.640
 in the first part of the day?

22:59.640 --> 23:02.880
 So I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.360
 Get as much light as you can.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.200
 It's your eyes.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.460
 Yeah, it's really nice.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.840
 Your system is primed.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.880
 If you're entrained, it's primed to get light.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.640
 The sun should be out.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.040
 Most animals in the wild,

23:14.040 --> 23:16.280
 they actually seem to track the sun.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.720
 The sun has a huge influence on life on earth.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.880
 It's actually, life on earth is because of sun.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.040
 So that's easy.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.000
 In the morning, when you wake up, you need light.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.040
 Okay, so what is the behavioral practice

23:28.040 --> 23:29.960
 that you recommend?

23:29.960 --> 23:32.120
 Does it, let's say somebody is in a condition

23:32.120 --> 23:33.680
 where there's a lot of cloud cover.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.520
 Yeah.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.600
 Is it important to get outside?

23:35.600 --> 23:37.900
 So I have to tell you, the cloudiest day

23:37.900 --> 23:40.120
 is gonna be much more brighter than your room.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.320
 You could ask any photographer.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.460
 A cloudy day, unless it's really dark, dark clouds,

23:45.460 --> 23:48.800
 usually cloudy days have much more bright outside

23:48.800 --> 23:49.840
 than inside the room,

23:49.840 --> 23:52.740
 even when you have good lighting inside the room.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.960
 So I think in the outside is usually,

23:55.960 --> 23:56.920
 even when it's cloudy,

23:56.920 --> 23:58.560
 you're gonna get enough intensity

23:58.560 --> 24:01.740
 to help you adjust your cycle to the day-night cycle.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.020
 So how long do you, these are general rules of thumb,

24:05.020 --> 24:07.080
 but how long do you recommend people go outside?

24:07.080 --> 24:09.920
 So if you do it daily, you possibly need very,

24:09.920 --> 24:11.680
 if you do it daily, because remember,

24:11.680 --> 24:13.480
 this thing is gonna happen on a daily matter.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.320
 So it's like 15 minutes.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.080
 So the clock is tracking it on a regular day.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.600
 Absolutely, it's photon counting, it's tracking,

24:19.600 --> 24:20.680
 I would say 15 minutes.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.600
 If you don't do it daily, you may wanna increase it.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.000
 And we'll talk about when you travel what you could do.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.960
 But yeah, 15 minutes should be fun.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.840
 You do it more, it doesn't hurt.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.360
 And through a window, I was,

24:31.360 --> 24:33.200
 my understanding is that through a window,

24:33.200 --> 24:34.440
 it dramatically decreases

24:34.440 --> 24:35.880
 the amount of light energy coming in.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.680
 It depends of how, you know,

24:37.680 --> 24:40.200
 how thick the windows are and how dark they are.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.840
 So it, but it's also nice to go outside

24:42.840 --> 24:44.440
 and to feel the season.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.040
 Sunglasses off.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.400
 I don't use sunglasses.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.600
 Yeah, but you have the, your Jordanian photo pigment,

24:50.600 --> 24:52.200
 you know, so yeah.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.320
 Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?

24:54.320 --> 24:56.840
 No, so I, but I personally,

24:56.840 --> 24:58.200
 you know, if I'm in the shade

24:58.200 --> 25:00.200
 or if it's not incredibly bright,

25:00.200 --> 25:02.000
 I try to, especially in the morning,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.560
 but I'm also an early person.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.200
 So we have to differentiate between early.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.200
 What time do you wake up?

25:06.200 --> 25:07.760
 I wake up at 4.30 in the morning.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.840
 But the sun isn't out yet.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.120
 It's not out yet, so it's.

25:10.120 --> 25:10.960
 So what do you do?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.080
 You turn on artificial lights?

25:12.080 --> 25:14.160
 I usually don't turn on artificial light

25:14.160 --> 25:16.520
 because I know the sun is gonna come up eventually.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.920
 But that's why I don't like the change

25:18.920 --> 25:20.520
 in the timing that they do.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.720
 Wait, well, what do you do between 4.30 a.m. and 7 a.m.?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.520
 I mean, I look at my computer.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.360
 Oh, I see.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.000
 So possibly I get enough light.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.320
 But in reality, I mean,

25:30.320 --> 25:33.840
 as long as you let your body get the morning sunlight,

25:33.840 --> 25:36.200
 which I think is really, to me,

25:36.200 --> 25:38.080
 and there is no evidence, but to me,

25:38.080 --> 25:40.840
 this is, if you look at all animals, plants,

25:40.840 --> 25:44.360
 this morning sunlight seems to be very important.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.400
 And I, you know, we don't have experiments to show it,

25:47.400 --> 25:48.800
 but I have a gut feeling

25:48.800 --> 25:51.680
 that it has a huge impact on humans.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.360
 Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab

25:54.360 --> 25:57.120
 has shown that these early morning light flashes

25:57.120 --> 25:59.640
 can adjust the total amount of sleep

25:59.640 --> 26:02.120
 that one will get, makes it easier to get into sleep.

26:02.120 --> 26:02.960
 Absolutely.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.960
 Okay, so.

26:03.960 --> 26:08.240
 And Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments

26:08.240 --> 26:09.080
 that showed that.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.600
 Right, maybe you should describe those

26:10.600 --> 26:11.840
 because those are beautiful experiments.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.160
 They are beautiful experiments.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.900
 He took these, you know, college students

26:15.900 --> 26:19.640
 that had the late onset of sleep and late waking time.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.280
 And then he said, let's go camping

26:21.280 --> 26:23.760
 and just don't use any artificial light

26:23.760 --> 26:27.760
 and you could go to sleep as late or as early as you want

26:27.760 --> 26:29.280
 and wake up as late as early.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.000
 And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern

26:33.000 --> 26:35.400
 just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.240
 I mean, so.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.680
 And it lasted.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.500
 And it lasted.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.340
 Even after they came back.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.180
 Exactly.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.000
 I think it was two days of camping,

26:41.000 --> 26:41.840
 reset the circadian clock.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.380
 Seven days, but it lasted.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.960
 Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.760
 Yeah, it's really incredible.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.800
 Okay, so get bright light of some sort

26:50.800 --> 26:52.720
 early in the day, ideally sunlight.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.760
 Even on a cloudy day,

26:53.760 --> 26:55.720
 it's going to be brighter than indoor light.

26:55.720 --> 26:56.600
 So that's easy.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
 Okay, so then.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.040
 And the other thing that I would like to mention to people.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.400
 If you think it's very dim outside,

27:02.400 --> 27:04.560
 let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.300
 So remember, intensity is only one component.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.840
 Duration is also important

27:08.840 --> 27:11.520
 because remember that the circadian system

27:11.520 --> 27:12.960
 is not like the image system.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.340
 In the image system, you have to change every second

27:15.340 --> 27:17.000
 because you're looking at different objects.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.040
 You have to change your perception.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.840
 But for the circadian system,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.240
 it's trying to figure out where am I

27:23.240 --> 27:24.960
 in the day-night cycle.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.040
 So the more you give them the information,

27:27.040 --> 27:28.040
 the better you are.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.560
 So if it's very bright, you don't need a lot

27:30.560 --> 27:33.720
 because it's clearly going to make you fire like crazy.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.680
 But if it's not bright, stay longer.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.240
 Stay for one hour.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.740
 Have your coffee outside or something like that.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.220
 It's just going to help.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.080
 I think you said something extremely important,

27:43.080 --> 27:45.260
 which is that this circadian system

27:45.260 --> 27:48.220
 is trying to figure out when you are in time.

27:48.220 --> 27:50.200
 Not where you are in space.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.540
 I said where you are in time, I meant when you are.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.700
 Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you.

27:53.700 --> 27:56.060
 I just meant that, I think fundamentally,

27:56.060 --> 27:59.880
 that's the incredible thing about this system,

27:59.880 --> 28:02.800
 that you have this clock, this 24-hour clock in your brain,

28:02.800 --> 28:05.560
 but it needs to be synchronized to the outside.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.840
 So could we go a little deeper

28:07.840 --> 28:10.440
 into this circadian setting behavior

28:10.440 --> 28:13.320
 and come up with some general rules of thumb?

28:13.320 --> 28:17.260
 So let's say it's a very bright day, extremely bright.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.540
 No clouds, sun's out.

28:20.940 --> 28:22.800
 You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.020
 And I'll tell you, if you're sensitive,

28:25.020 --> 28:26.720
 you don't even have to go in the sun.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.120
 You could be in the shade.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.240
 There's going to be so many photons out there in the shade.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.320
 It's going to be perfect.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.360
 You don't even have to see the sun.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.120
 You don't have to have the sun.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.320
 It's great for vitamin D.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.280
 That's a different story.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.160
 You could do this for your skin and protect your skin.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.780
 That's not my area of expertise.

28:43.780 --> 28:47.720
 But for that effect on the circadian system,

28:47.720 --> 28:50.960
 as long as you're outside in the shade and it's a sunny day,

28:50.960 --> 28:53.560
 10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.040
 Okay, and then let's say it's kind of overcast.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.320
 You know, it's not particularly bright

28:59.320 --> 29:00.940
 or there's, you know, solid cloud cover,

29:00.940 --> 29:02.880
 but, you know, obviously the sun is out,

29:02.880 --> 29:05.280
 but it's not as bright.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.360
 How long do you think it would take to set the clock?

29:07.360 --> 29:09.300
 10 to 15 should be sufficient.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.760
 Stay for half an hour, stay for 45 minutes.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.540
 If it's very dark cloud, yeah, stay for longer.

29:14.540 --> 29:17.600
 Okay, and if for some reason one finds themselves

29:17.600 --> 29:22.600
 very far north and it's very, very dense cloud cover,

29:22.600 --> 29:26.000
 how long and at what point should somebody consider

29:26.000 --> 29:30.200
 using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight?

29:30.200 --> 29:32.560
 Yeah, honestly, this is where we don't have

29:32.560 --> 29:34.200
 a lot of information still,

29:34.200 --> 29:36.960
 because this is where we're going to discuss this

29:36.960 --> 29:40.000
 maybe in more detail that if you put humans

29:40.000 --> 29:42.040
 in artificial conditions,

29:42.040 --> 29:45.600
 the circadian system is very sensitive to light.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.840
 But in reality, in the real environment,

29:48.840 --> 29:51.220
 light also is affecting other aspects

29:51.220 --> 29:53.540
 that are independent of the setting

29:53.540 --> 29:55.280
 of the circadian basemaker.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.120
 Okay.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.000
 And these which we call the direct effect of light

29:58.000 --> 29:59.960
 on mood, for example.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.160
 So that is very hard to figure out

30:02.160 --> 30:03.760
 what intensity you need to use,

30:03.760 --> 30:05.320
 and we haven't done enough experiments,

30:05.320 --> 30:07.920
 because the system has been discovered just recently.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.980
 But I would say if you use bright light in the morning,

30:11.980 --> 30:14.580
 and I mean, it's hard for me to give numbers,

30:14.580 --> 30:16.100
 it can get complicated.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.620
 But yeah, I mean, if you're,

30:19.620 --> 30:21.460
 honestly if you're that far north

30:21.460 --> 30:23.220
 and you're in the winter and you want to get,

30:23.220 --> 30:25.580
 make sure you don't use these light boxes,

30:25.580 --> 30:28.740
 I would suggest that personally, but that's it.

30:28.740 --> 30:31.700
 I use, it's actually not designed for circadian setting,

30:31.700 --> 30:35.940
 but I have a 930 lux light pad that I bought,

30:35.940 --> 30:38.060
 and I bought it, they're very affordable

30:38.060 --> 30:40.860
 compared to the Dawn simulating lights,

30:40.860 --> 30:43.460
 which are quite expensive, frankly.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.960
 And I put it there, and so I just basically,

30:45.960 --> 30:47.020
 when I wake up in the morning,

30:47.020 --> 30:48.900
 I use that until the sun comes out,

30:48.900 --> 30:51.180
 and then I make sure once the sun is out, I go outside.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.280
 But I keep that thing on all day.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.100
 And I don't know if that's good or bad.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.100
 Is it good or bad?

30:56.100 --> 30:59.340
 I honestly, I don't think being exposed to bright light

30:59.340 --> 31:00.820
 in the day is going to ever be bad,

31:00.820 --> 31:03.740
 because really, if you're outside in the day,

31:03.740 --> 31:06.100
 unless, you know, the worst is gonna happen

31:06.100 --> 31:07.660
 if the temperature is very high,

31:07.660 --> 31:10.340
 your body's gonna say don't dehydrate and go to sleep.

31:10.340 --> 31:13.940
 So you could tell actually sometimes when it's very hot,

31:13.940 --> 31:15.820
 the more you get exposed to bright light,

31:15.820 --> 31:17.780
 the sleepier you feel in the afternoon,

31:17.780 --> 31:19.260
 which is counterintuitive.

31:20.180 --> 31:21.020
 So, but.

31:21.020 --> 31:23.340
 And that's to protect us, you think, against dehydration?

31:23.340 --> 31:26.020
 I think if you think about the human evolution

31:26.020 --> 31:28.420
 from near the equator in the,

31:28.420 --> 31:31.620
 between noon and a certain time in the afternoon,

31:31.620 --> 31:34.600
 it would have been very hard for you to maintain

31:34.600 --> 31:36.620
 physiological homeostatic function,

31:36.620 --> 31:39.700
 being active at this very high temperature time.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.060
 So I think napping was a way,

31:42.060 --> 31:44.060
 that's why I think it has a major function,

31:44.060 --> 31:47.100
 which is still, napping was a way to somehow

31:47.100 --> 31:49.180
 take you away from that dangerous zone.

31:49.180 --> 31:51.820
 And maybe that's why people in the north,

31:51.820 --> 31:54.100
 they say in the winter, we can't wake up in the morning

31:54.100 --> 31:55.680
 because they don't have this long light,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.280
 so they sleep it more at night.

31:57.280 --> 32:00.320
 But in the summer, they say we feel like we can't go to sleep

32:00.320 --> 32:02.940
 we have to put all these dark curtains.

32:02.940 --> 32:06.940
 So I think, you know, venturing that much north,

32:06.940 --> 32:09.820
 up north, has been, came up with problem

32:09.820 --> 32:13.100
 because evolution was used to a certain light environment

32:13.100 --> 32:16.380
 that was completely changed with a human,

32:16.380 --> 32:19.360
 with other animals, I think, that lived there longer.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.740
 They have come up with very interesting adaptation

32:22.740 --> 32:26.180
 of actually measuring even very small changes

32:26.180 --> 32:29.060
 in the light, in the light intensities that still occur.

32:29.060 --> 32:32.260
 So even if you're near the poles,

32:32.260 --> 32:33.900
 even though it's always light,

32:33.900 --> 32:36.020
 but there is a change in the light intensity

32:36.020 --> 32:37.180
 across the day and night cycle.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.020
 So your system, if it's linear,

32:39.020 --> 32:42.820
 and remember I told you that IP RGCs are incredibly linear,

32:42.820 --> 32:46.460
 can still measure, oh, this is lower light than higher light

32:46.460 --> 32:49.740
 if the organism has the ability to do that.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.200
 I see, you know, it's interesting,

32:51.200 --> 32:54.520
 I've spent so much time learning from you,

32:54.520 --> 32:56.580
 fortunately, about these cells,

32:56.580 --> 33:00.020
 and yet I never really appreciated until now how,

33:00.020 --> 33:03.160
 on the one hand, they are tracking the amount of light

33:03.160 --> 33:05.420
 to understand when we are in time

33:05.420 --> 33:07.820
 relative to the 24-hour cycle,

33:07.820 --> 33:09.860
 but also that you keep mentioning

33:09.860 --> 33:11.860
 this linear measurement of intensity,

33:11.860 --> 33:13.860
 that they really are trying to figure out

33:13.860 --> 33:16.500
 when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.900
 And of course, the sun is the most intense source

33:18.900 --> 33:21.020
 of light available to us.

33:21.020 --> 33:24.180
 So, okay, so I think we've nailed down

33:24.180 --> 33:25.900
 that first part of the day.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.600
 Basically, it's get 10 to 30 minutes,

33:27.600 --> 33:29.000
 depending on how bright it is,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.420
 and try and do that as often as possible

33:31.420 --> 33:32.580
 to give the system a regular-

33:32.580 --> 33:33.420
 Daily is the best.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.820
 This system is really about,

33:35.820 --> 33:38.460
 and you'll see that even for the effect on depression,

33:38.460 --> 33:40.580
 it's about multiple days.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.280
 So you don't have to worry if you missed it one day,

33:43.280 --> 33:45.140
 you know, stay longer if you want,

33:45.140 --> 33:48.140
 but if you're in a hurry and you want to do other stuff,

33:48.140 --> 33:49.980
 that's a great recommendation.

33:49.980 --> 33:51.980
 So you might want to compensate with some extra time

33:51.980 --> 33:53.740
 if you missed a day or two.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.900
 And this is why I've heard you say before,

33:55.900 --> 33:58.940
 it's entirely possible to get severely jet-lagged

33:58.940 --> 33:59.880
 without traveling.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.720
 Absolutely.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.980
 Simply by staying in, being on your phone too much,

34:02.980 --> 34:03.980
 not getting the sunlight.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.060
 And you saw this during the pandemic.

34:06.060 --> 34:07.380
 A lot of people mentioned

34:07.380 --> 34:09.800
 that their sleep-wake cycles suffered a lot.

34:10.740 --> 34:12.980
 Because if you're not going out,

34:12.980 --> 34:14.500
 and if you're staying at home,

34:14.500 --> 34:16.380
 and you don't have big windows,

34:16.380 --> 34:18.740
 and you're waking late, waking up late,

34:18.740 --> 34:21.540
 and then you're using very bright light till late at night,

34:21.540 --> 34:23.180
 your body's going to shift.

34:23.180 --> 34:26.060
 And now your day is going to start instead of,

34:26.060 --> 34:27.580
 like really when the sun comes up,

34:27.580 --> 34:29.320
 let's say at six o'clock in the morning,

34:29.320 --> 34:30.160
 it's going to,

34:30.160 --> 34:32.060
 your day is going to start at 11 o'clock in the morning.

34:32.060 --> 34:33.660
 That's what your body's going to think

34:33.660 --> 34:35.780
 is the beginning of the day.

34:35.780 --> 34:38.340
 So then you're not going to be able to sleep

34:38.340 --> 34:39.700
 at 10 o'clock at night,

34:39.700 --> 34:43.340
 because now that's really for your body

34:43.340 --> 34:45.340
 is completely different timing.

34:45.340 --> 34:48.020
 And you could see this happen during the pandemic

34:48.020 --> 34:49.500
 at a very high scale.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.680
 People get delayed in their sleep-wake cycle a lot.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.900
 And there is this idea of chronotypes

34:54.900 --> 34:59.100
 that we all each intrinsically have a best rhythm

34:59.100 --> 35:00.940
 of either being a morning person,

35:00.940 --> 35:02.540
 you called yourself an early person,

35:02.540 --> 35:03.740
 or a night owl,

35:03.740 --> 35:05.820
 or more of a kind of standard,

35:05.820 --> 35:08.920
 to bed around 10, 30, up around seven type thing.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.260
 And I think there are now good data,

35:11.260 --> 35:12.740
 correct me if I'm wrong,

35:12.740 --> 35:15.060
 from the National Institutes of Mental Health and elsewhere,

35:15.060 --> 35:19.100
 showing that the more we deviate from that intrinsic rhythm,

35:19.100 --> 35:21.220
 the more mental health issues

35:21.220 --> 35:23.100
 and physical health issues start to crop up.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.900
 So there is great data on this,

35:24.900 --> 35:27.100
 and there is a couple of things that complicate this.

35:27.100 --> 35:30.460
 The first is the people who usually are late,

35:30.460 --> 35:32.940
 they tell you that the society doesn't accommodate.

35:32.940 --> 35:34.900
 What, by late, what do you mean?

35:34.900 --> 35:36.540
 People that wake up late and go to sleep late?

35:36.540 --> 35:38.580
 Go to sleep late and wake up late.

35:38.580 --> 35:42.060
 They have an overwhelmingly higher level of depression

35:42.060 --> 35:43.460
 and failures.

35:43.460 --> 35:44.660
 I mean, clearly, I mean,

35:44.660 --> 35:48.820
 the reason that people say sleep early, wake up early,

35:48.820 --> 35:49.660
 you're better,

35:49.660 --> 35:52.540
 because human notice that people who wake up,

35:52.540 --> 35:54.300
 go to sleep early and wake up early,

35:54.300 --> 35:55.460
 they do better in life.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.300
 They notice that.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.340
 They just perform better.

35:57.340 --> 35:58.180
 They perform.

35:58.180 --> 36:01.380
 But the question is, is that intrinsic to the system,

36:01.380 --> 36:02.460
 or is that society?

36:02.460 --> 36:05.080
 Because society start things usually early or late.

36:05.080 --> 36:05.920
 That's a hard question to ask.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.940
 We discriminate against late risers.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.640
 In a way, we discriminate, right?

36:09.640 --> 36:12.940
 But the other explanation is Ken Wright's experiment.

36:12.940 --> 36:14.700
 These late riser,

36:14.700 --> 36:18.140
 if they were truly chronotypically late,

36:18.140 --> 36:21.720
 why would they shift so easily when you put them in the,

36:21.720 --> 36:23.940
 if you were really chronotypically late,

36:23.940 --> 36:25.820
 and there is a phase relation

36:25.820 --> 36:27.300
 between the light-dark environment

36:27.300 --> 36:28.820
 and your circadian clock,

36:28.820 --> 36:30.580
 then doing this camping experiment

36:30.580 --> 36:32.460
 should not have caused much changes,

36:32.460 --> 36:37.260
 because it's not that light is gonna affect you

36:37.260 --> 36:38.100
 in a certain way.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.820
 It's that this is the relationship that your body decided,

36:40.820 --> 36:43.820
 that I'm a late sleeper, late waking.

36:43.820 --> 36:48.120
 So, honestly, I'm still unable to figure out

36:48.120 --> 36:50.300
 how much of this late waking up

36:50.300 --> 36:52.580
 is controlled by the light environment,

36:52.580 --> 36:53.820
 and how much is intrinsic.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.840
 I'm sure there are differences.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.540
 But are they as big as we see in the environment?

36:58.540 --> 37:02.800
 Because you have people that go up to sleep at 7 p.m.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.140
 and wake up at 1 a.m.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.220
 These are clearly advanced phase.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.020
 So people that go to sleep at 7 p.m.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.380
 and wake up at 1 a.m.

37:09.380 --> 37:11.060
 and feel good doing that.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.740
 I'm not so sure they feel good,

37:12.740 --> 37:14.800
 but a lot of the time you talk to people,

37:14.800 --> 37:17.060
 they say they are high achievers,

37:17.060 --> 37:20.300
 but they suffer because they go to 7 p.m.,

37:20.300 --> 37:22.540
 wake up advanced phase sleep syndrome,

37:22.540 --> 37:25.380
 they call it, they call it a syndrome.

37:25.380 --> 37:28.300
 But then you have people who would not be able

37:28.300 --> 37:29.780
 to sleep till 5 a.m.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.580
 and not be able to wake up till 3 p.m., right?

37:33.580 --> 37:35.880
 And I'm not so sure that the circadian system

37:35.880 --> 37:38.100
 is that variable in the human population.

37:38.100 --> 37:40.740
 I mean, clearly there are maybe some genetic factors

37:40.740 --> 37:43.820
 that make a small percentage of everything

37:43.820 --> 37:45.420
 with a bell shape.

37:45.420 --> 37:47.120
 But I think most of the time,

37:47.120 --> 37:49.100
 the light environment may play a role.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.460
 And once, as we've talked about,

37:51.460 --> 37:53.800
 this is a long-term effect of light.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.900
 Once you get into a rhythm,

37:55.900 --> 37:58.060
 and I don't mean it as a pun in reality,

37:58.060 --> 37:59.400
 once you get into a rhythm,

37:59.400 --> 38:01.800
 it's hard to break out of that rhythm.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.780
 Because if you start sleeping late and waking up late,

38:04.780 --> 38:06.740
 you're not getting the morning sunlight.

38:06.740 --> 38:07.580
 Right.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.620
 And so you're just gonna be late.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.940
 And if you're like me, waking up early,

38:11.940 --> 38:13.300
 you're getting the morning sunlight.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.800
 You're getting what Zeisler said, I said his last name wrong,

38:19.420 --> 38:21.020
 the one in Stanford who did the-

38:21.020 --> 38:22.180
 Oh, Jamie Zeisler.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.540
 Zeisler, yeah.

38:23.540 --> 38:27.420
 He actually worked for Zeisler, so Zeisler and Zeisler.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.600
 Yeah, there are a lot of Zs and Is in their names.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.260
 Both phenomenal scientists.

38:32.260 --> 38:35.700
 Well, what it seems to me is the case

38:35.700 --> 38:38.280
 is that the only way to really know

38:38.280 --> 38:41.460
 if you're meant to be an early bird, as they call it,

38:41.460 --> 38:43.500
 an early person or a late person,

38:43.500 --> 38:46.220
 or somewhere in between, is to get morning sunlight

38:46.220 --> 38:48.260
 and figure out whether or not that makes you feel better.

38:48.260 --> 38:52.500
 And to understand, to be educated

38:52.500 --> 38:54.780
 about how to measure intensity,

38:54.780 --> 38:57.180
 how to measure, I put it between quotation,

38:57.180 --> 38:59.740
 because you either get a measuring device,

38:59.740 --> 39:03.560
 but you cannot depend on your eye to measure intensity.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.500
 Okay, so how do we do that?

39:04.500 --> 39:06.120
 Because you keep coming back to this,

39:06.120 --> 39:08.020
 so that tells me that it's important.

39:08.020 --> 39:08.860
 It's very important.

39:08.860 --> 39:12.820
 So there are apps, like free apps, like Light Meter,

39:12.820 --> 39:14.560
 where you can walk around and hold the button down

39:14.560 --> 39:17.860
 and see how many lux are in the environment.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.060
 These are complicated because you have to point them

39:20.060 --> 39:21.540
 to specific regions.

39:21.540 --> 39:25.080
 So how do people start to develop an intuitive sense

39:25.080 --> 39:27.260
 of the measurement of intensity?

39:27.260 --> 39:30.900
 Yeah, I think at one point I posted on Instagram

39:30.900 --> 39:33.540
 how I keep my nighttime at home.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.920
 And I found out that my night vision is very strong.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.620
 So I found out that I, especially in the winter,

39:39.620 --> 39:41.180
 I only need candle light.

39:41.180 --> 39:43.620
 So I literally use these tea lights,

39:43.620 --> 39:45.820
 and I put like 15 or 20 of them.

39:45.820 --> 39:46.700
 How romantic.

39:46.700 --> 39:47.760
 And it's so nice.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.140
 I could see it clearly doesn't affect my circadian system.

39:51.140 --> 39:52.180
 You and your cats.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.220
 And my wife.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.060
 And your wife, of course.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.800
 It's just great, it's just great, right?

39:55.800 --> 39:56.980
 But I don't expect people

39:56.980 --> 39:59.380
 to have the same night vision as me.

39:59.380 --> 40:03.020
 So the simple, I mean, I tell people, do the experiment.

40:03.020 --> 40:07.220
 So if you put three or four lights in your room,

40:07.220 --> 40:10.440
 switch to, sit for 15 minutes, switch two off.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.280
 Switch two off.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.740
 Let's say you're using five.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.580
 And see, after 15 minutes,

40:14.580 --> 40:17.340
 you will not recognize you switched these two off.

40:17.340 --> 40:19.820
 My gut feeling is that most people would need

40:19.820 --> 40:24.000
 at least 10 times less light than they use at night to see.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.500
 The problem people use it,

40:25.500 --> 40:27.380
 because most of the time they didn't see

40:27.380 --> 40:28.260
 the morning sunlight.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.060
 They are actually hungry for light without their knowledge.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.020
 So they come switch all these lights on,

40:33.020 --> 40:36.180
 but at the wrong time, because they woke up late.

40:36.180 --> 40:37.820
 Okay, now I understand.

40:37.820 --> 40:41.280
 So this morning light viewing goes way beyond

40:41.280 --> 40:42.940
 setting your clock.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.740
 It's also a way to determine

40:44.740 --> 40:48.120
 how little light you need later in the day.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.120
 And we're going to talk about this in a moment,

40:50.120 --> 40:53.220
 but how little light you get later in the day

40:53.220 --> 40:55.040
 is a very strong determinant of things

40:55.040 --> 40:56.080
 like when you will wake up,

40:56.080 --> 40:58.380
 whether or not you wake up feeling refreshed, et cetera.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.220
 Let's-

40:59.220 --> 41:00.260
 And that's why.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.100
 Yeah.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.860
 I'm going to break it on your show, Andrew,

41:02.860 --> 41:04.020
 that I'm going to tell you,

41:04.020 --> 41:06.020
 I think there is something else

41:06.020 --> 41:07.340
 that people need to think about,

41:07.340 --> 41:09.540
 which is the tripartite model.

41:09.540 --> 41:12.340
 That this model incorporate three components

41:12.340 --> 41:13.860
 we should talk about in details

41:13.860 --> 41:17.780
 that allows us humans and all animals

41:17.780 --> 41:20.360
 to incorporate the circadian clock

41:20.360 --> 41:22.020
 and its relation to light,

41:22.020 --> 41:24.040
 the homeostatic drive,

41:24.040 --> 41:26.140
 and the direct effect of the environment,

41:26.140 --> 41:29.180
 which includes stress, light, all kinds of stuff.

41:29.180 --> 41:31.320
 They have to be incorporated together.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.540
 If you think, that's what I think right now,

41:33.540 --> 41:35.480
 if you think of one alone,

41:35.480 --> 41:37.700
 you will always miss something.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.940
 And when you think of them as a whole,

41:39.940 --> 41:41.480
 things really become clear.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.020
 It's actually quite amazing.

41:43.020 --> 41:45.540
 Okay, well, we will definitely want to hear

41:45.540 --> 41:47.380
 about your tripartite theory

41:47.380 --> 41:50.620
 and go into detail about this homeostatic mechanisms.

41:50.620 --> 41:53.980
 I want to make sure that for people who are thinking now,

41:53.980 --> 41:56.860
 I'm sure, about light and how it impacts them.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.940
 So the morning light viewing behavior,

41:58.940 --> 42:01.160
 I like to think we've tacked down clearly.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
 And thank you for that

42:02.160 --> 42:03.920
 because there's so much information out there

42:03.920 --> 42:06.020
 and I've tried to relay that information.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.260
 Of course, you're my primary source

42:07.260 --> 42:09.500
 for all things circadian,

42:09.500 --> 42:12.020
 as well as Jamie and others, of course, Matt Walker.

42:12.020 --> 42:15.940
 But I think you've made that very, very clear.

42:15.940 --> 42:20.460
 Now, let's say I've gotten my morning sunlight, okay?

42:20.460 --> 42:21.620
 Made my bright artificial light.

42:21.620 --> 42:23.860
 And throughout the day, you said to get a lot of light.

42:23.860 --> 42:25.020
 So I'm working at my desk.

42:25.020 --> 42:27.860
 Maybe I'll go out during the day a few times,

42:27.860 --> 42:30.500
 but I'm working at my computer, I'm doing things.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.100
 Is there anything about light viewing

42:32.100 --> 42:35.540
 in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind?

42:35.540 --> 42:37.660
 Or can they just sort of freestyle it,

42:37.660 --> 42:38.540
 depending on what they're doing?

42:38.540 --> 42:42.580
 Most people are not in a dark room throughout the day.

42:42.580 --> 42:45.540
 My gut feeling, if you got your morning sunlight,

42:45.540 --> 42:49.700
 you walk from your car slowly or you walk to work,

42:49.700 --> 42:50.860
 you didn't wear sunglasses

42:50.860 --> 42:53.380
 when the lights were still dim in the morning,

42:53.380 --> 42:55.000
 that you could freestyle it.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.700
 That even if you don't get a lot of light,

42:57.700 --> 43:01.060
 there is a way to just, you know, in the day,

43:01.060 --> 43:02.340
 you don't have to just worry

43:02.340 --> 43:03.820
 about getting a lot of bright light.

43:03.820 --> 43:05.820
 But personally, I like to do that.

43:05.820 --> 43:09.660
 So I go out at lunch and have my lunch outside as well.

43:09.660 --> 43:13.540
 This reminds the body that here it is even brighter now.

43:13.540 --> 43:16.620
 But the evidence is that you could literally

43:16.620 --> 43:20.380
 help your circadian clock by giving lights at dawn and dusk.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.860
 But again, if you think of the tripartite model,

43:22.860 --> 43:25.060
 this may be important versus circadian clock,

43:25.060 --> 43:27.900
 but is it important for your mood?

43:27.900 --> 43:31.260
 So that's where I think you need, or the homeostatic drive.

43:31.260 --> 43:33.620
 So that's where you need to think about it.

43:33.620 --> 43:36.780
 So for the clock, for entraining your clock,

43:36.780 --> 43:39.820
 you literally can entrain it only by the dawn sunlight.

43:39.820 --> 43:41.580
 You actually don't need dawn and dusk.

43:41.580 --> 43:42.820
 You can even forget that.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.840
 Yeah, and I appreciate that you're distinguishing

43:44.840 --> 43:47.660
 between circadian effects and other effects of light.

43:47.660 --> 43:51.580
 You're being very precise, which is appreciated.

43:51.580 --> 43:53.660
 Until we hear about this tripartite model,

43:53.660 --> 43:57.320
 which we will cover, for the sake of the discussion,

43:57.320 --> 43:59.580
 let's treat the light viewing behavior

43:59.580 --> 44:04.260
 as what are the benefits or drawbacks of viewing light

44:04.260 --> 44:07.380
 for all biological purposes, not just circadian settings.

44:07.380 --> 44:10.820
 So in the morning, it's clearly going to set the clock.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.820
 And then during the day, if I understand correctly,

44:13.820 --> 44:15.860
 the idea is to get as much bright light as you can

44:15.860 --> 44:17.280
 because you're feeding, it sounds like,

44:17.280 --> 44:19.820
 a sort of light hunger.

44:19.820 --> 44:20.660
 Exactly.

44:20.660 --> 44:21.500
 I see.

44:21.500 --> 44:22.320
 I love this way to put it.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.260
 I think there is a weird light hunger.

44:24.260 --> 44:27.700
 Considering that we're not photosynthetic organisms,

44:27.700 --> 44:29.880
 there is a weird light hunger in animals

44:29.880 --> 44:33.180
 that they need to measure, they need measure.

44:33.180 --> 44:35.140
 And I think that relates to the season

44:35.140 --> 44:38.220
 because the whole reproduction cycle of animals

44:38.220 --> 44:41.700
 is gonna depend on the availability of food

44:41.700 --> 44:42.640
 in the environment.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.300
 And if you don't know when the season's gonna happen,

44:45.300 --> 44:47.040
 they don't have calendars,

44:47.040 --> 44:48.740
 it's gonna be very hard to survive.

44:48.740 --> 44:51.100
 So I think that's why we have this light hunger.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.700
 That's a major hypothesis.

44:52.700 --> 44:54.020
 It's not been tested.

44:54.020 --> 44:54.860
 Interesting.

44:54.860 --> 44:59.100
 So then afternoon and evening start to approach.

44:59.100 --> 45:00.780
 So I've had this weird experience.

45:00.780 --> 45:02.820
 Maybe you can psychologically

45:02.820 --> 45:05.260
 or biologically diagnose me now, Sameer.

45:05.260 --> 45:07.840
 So where if I go into a movie in the afternoon,

45:07.840 --> 45:11.540
 like a matinee, and I come out and it's dark,

45:11.540 --> 45:15.180
 I notice a significant drop in my mood

45:15.180 --> 45:17.840
 and my ability to go to sleep.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.460
 Whereas if I get some view of the light in the evening,

45:21.460 --> 45:22.700
 it doesn't have to be the sunset,

45:22.700 --> 45:23.900
 although sunsets are nice,

45:23.900 --> 45:26.780
 but I get some light pulse in the afternoon

45:26.780 --> 45:29.180
 that I have no trouble whatsoever.

45:29.180 --> 45:32.980
 And this happens in a daily, on a single time to watch?

45:32.980 --> 45:33.820
 More or less.

45:34.700 --> 45:35.520
 That's interesting.

45:35.520 --> 45:37.260
 And then you mentioned the camping experiment

45:37.260 --> 45:38.400
 where when they went camping,

45:38.400 --> 45:41.140
 they're seeing the sunrise and the sunset.

45:41.140 --> 45:46.140
 So what should people do in the afternoon slash evening time

45:46.140 --> 45:48.180
 in terms of their light viewing behavior?

45:48.180 --> 45:49.580
 I mean, the best thing to do

45:49.580 --> 45:53.100
 is to let the natural light creep in into darkness, right?

45:53.100 --> 45:54.680
 That would be the best.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.060
 But clearly that would be inefficient.

45:57.060 --> 45:59.740
 You wanna go home, you wanna read,

45:59.740 --> 46:01.720
 you wanna talk to your kids,

46:01.720 --> 46:03.400
 you wanna talk to your family.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.000
 So I think, you know, it's nice to extend the day.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.140
 I don't think that's wrong.

46:07.140 --> 46:10.220
 If you somehow can block that light

46:10.220 --> 46:12.100
 from affecting your circadian clock.

46:12.100 --> 46:15.420
 So should people use blue blockers in the evening?

46:15.420 --> 46:19.020
 I personally do not like any blockers

46:19.020 --> 46:20.980
 that take a single wavelength of light.

46:20.980 --> 46:24.220
 Because again, if you think of a holistic approach,

46:24.220 --> 46:26.180
 yes, the blue blocker is gonna prevent you

46:26.180 --> 46:29.580
 from affecting your circadian clock very much,

46:29.580 --> 46:31.720
 but then your vision is gonna be distorted

46:31.720 --> 46:34.220
 because we always see in full spectrum.

46:34.220 --> 46:36.860
 The sun has this beautiful spectrum, right?

46:36.860 --> 46:39.280
 And then when you start seeing without the blue,

46:40.420 --> 46:43.740
 things look yellow and it can get really weird, right?

46:43.740 --> 46:46.380
 I mean, so I personally,

46:46.380 --> 46:49.420
 I've tried the blue blocker and I couldn't even wear them.

46:49.420 --> 46:52.980
 I thought they were just really horrendous, to be honest.

46:52.980 --> 46:54.940
 Well, along the lines of blue blockers,

46:54.940 --> 46:58.340
 I think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long.

46:58.340 --> 46:59.660
 Oh my God, that would be very bad.

46:59.660 --> 47:01.260
 A lot of people do that.

47:01.260 --> 47:02.180
 A lot of people do that.

47:02.180 --> 47:04.060
 They think that the blue light is bad.

47:04.060 --> 47:07.940
 I think that the concept of blue light being bad

47:07.940 --> 47:10.380
 led to a lot of product development.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.900
 And a lot of people are just assuming

47:11.900 --> 47:14.580
 that viewing blue light is what was giving them headaches

47:14.580 --> 47:16.060
 when, in fact, it might have just been looking

47:16.060 --> 47:17.940
 at screens at close distance.

47:17.940 --> 47:19.460
 So here's the problem, right?

47:19.460 --> 47:22.060
 I mean, the blue light got the bad reputation

47:22.060 --> 47:24.100
 because people who gave a pure blue light

47:24.100 --> 47:26.980
 showed that it caused a huge retinal damage.

47:26.980 --> 47:30.420
 But again, if you're using blue light in its pure form,

47:30.420 --> 47:33.620
 it has a lot of energy because it's shorter wavelength.

47:33.620 --> 47:36.380
 But we're talking about full spectrum light.

47:36.380 --> 47:39.700
 There are ways now where you could change the spectrum

47:39.700 --> 47:43.300
 of the light and keep it white between day and night

47:43.300 --> 47:47.580
 and change the content of the color without you noticing.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.780
 So you don't even have to affect your vision.

47:49.780 --> 47:51.500
 So how would you go about doing that?

47:51.500 --> 47:53.780
 So you just lower the level of the blue light.

47:53.780 --> 47:54.940
 You don't have to eliminate it.

47:54.940 --> 47:56.260
 So just dim the lights.

47:56.260 --> 47:59.220
 Dim the blue, then increase the yellow,

47:59.220 --> 48:02.860
 but keep all the colors in a certain white

48:02.860 --> 48:06.820
 so you could have different warmness of white.

48:06.820 --> 48:08.260
 And people know how to do this.

48:08.260 --> 48:09.660
 Physicists know how to do this.

48:09.660 --> 48:11.580
 People who work with light know how to do this.

48:11.580 --> 48:14.260
 Well, maybe somebody in the wellness slash,

48:14.260 --> 48:15.100
 I don't like the word,

48:15.100 --> 48:18.620
 but biohacking or optical community will do this.

48:18.620 --> 48:20.140
 I think it's really important.

48:20.140 --> 48:22.380
 I see so many people wearing blue lockers.

48:22.380 --> 48:24.020
 I don't know why they love blue.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.180
 Well, I think they're just uninformed.

48:25.180 --> 48:26.020
 I think, frankly-

48:26.020 --> 48:27.860
 And to be honest, it's easy, right?

48:27.860 --> 48:30.100
 It's easier to explain to somebody,

48:30.100 --> 48:32.540
 if IPRCCs respond mostly to blue,

48:32.540 --> 48:34.700
 remove blue, you'll be fine, right?

48:34.700 --> 48:36.260
 But that's not as simple as that

48:36.260 --> 48:38.340
 because they also receive road and cone input.

48:38.340 --> 48:39.980
 So you want to actually,

48:39.980 --> 48:41.860
 and we could go into details

48:41.860 --> 48:43.300
 that's boring for you listeners,

48:43.300 --> 48:45.740
 but it also affect the adaptation properties

48:45.740 --> 48:47.140
 of the whole retina.

48:47.140 --> 48:49.580
 So you don't want to do something so drastic

48:49.580 --> 48:51.820
 that you take just one color of the spectrum.

48:51.820 --> 48:56.500
 It just seems very counterintuitive to me, to be honest.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.620
 You've told me before as well

48:58.620 --> 49:02.380
 that just because these intrinsically photosensitive

49:02.380 --> 49:05.220
 circadian setting ganglion cells

49:05.220 --> 49:07.180
 respond best to blue light,

49:07.180 --> 49:08.780
 if the light is bright enough,

49:08.780 --> 49:12.380
 because they also get input from other components of the eye,

49:12.380 --> 49:14.940
 it doesn't matter if you block the blues.

49:14.940 --> 49:16.500
 If you're looking at bright light at night,

49:16.500 --> 49:18.500
 you're going to disrupt your circadian cycle.

49:18.500 --> 49:20.860
 And that's why I didn't want to go into the boring details,

49:20.860 --> 49:22.660
 but themselves, the photoreceptors

49:22.660 --> 49:25.300
 have a wide range of responsiveness.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.340
 So they are most sensitive to blue light,

49:27.340 --> 49:30.260
 but that doesn't mean they don't respond to green light

49:30.260 --> 49:32.180
 or to shorter than blue light.

49:32.180 --> 49:35.300
 They respond to very, very wide spectrum

49:35.300 --> 49:36.980
 with different sensitivities.

49:36.980 --> 49:40.660
 So unless you understand the system, just removing 480,

49:40.660 --> 49:41.660
 I don't think it's going to do anything.

49:41.660 --> 49:43.460
 480 nanometers, yeah.

49:43.460 --> 49:48.460
 So your home is a cave at night, basically.

49:48.540 --> 49:49.740
 It's a nice cave.

49:49.740 --> 49:52.340
 It's a nice cave with candles, right?

49:52.340 --> 49:56.140
 And you and your cats and your lovely wife,

49:56.140 --> 49:58.260
 who I know who's also a phenomenal scientist

49:58.260 --> 49:59.100
 in her own right.

49:59.100 --> 49:59.940
 Thank you, yeah, she is.

49:59.940 --> 50:00.780
 She is.

50:01.860 --> 50:06.140
 But you do keep your home quite dim to dark at night.

50:06.140 --> 50:10.100
 In fact, I did go to meetings with some of my friends

50:10.100 --> 50:12.300
 who work on this and they really struggled with me.

50:12.300 --> 50:14.580
 They said we could have broken our legs

50:14.580 --> 50:16.980
 living in the same light environment that you do.

50:16.980 --> 50:20.460
 So I am an extreme, but I measured it for myself

50:20.460 --> 50:22.900
 and I asked Reiji, my wife, if she's okay with it.

50:22.900 --> 50:24.220
 She also liked the dimness.

50:24.220 --> 50:27.140
 Both of us can see well in dim conditions

50:27.140 --> 50:29.300
 and that helps us a lot.

50:30.540 --> 50:32.740
 But I think you have to measure it for yourself.

50:32.740 --> 50:36.460
 You really have to do, it's a very simple experiment.

50:36.460 --> 50:38.980
 Just try to dim the light as much as you can.

50:38.980 --> 50:41.540
 I call it the minimum amount of light

50:41.540 --> 50:44.260
 you require to see comfortably.

50:44.260 --> 50:47.140
 And that's how you want your environment ideally at night.

50:47.140 --> 50:49.940
 This is what I think is the game changer.

50:49.940 --> 50:53.380
 If you reach to a level where it's just barely,

50:53.380 --> 50:56.580
 you're literally on the cusp of seeing uncomfortably

50:56.580 --> 50:58.780
 versus seeing very comfortably,

50:58.780 --> 51:01.540
 you are gonna be very much better

51:01.540 --> 51:04.260
 than I don't like to make it completely dark.

51:04.260 --> 51:08.140
 I think complete darkness induce anxiety in humans,

51:08.140 --> 51:10.740
 to be honest, so I don't like complete darkness.

51:11.820 --> 51:12.660
 In fact-

51:12.660 --> 51:13.500
 Kids don't like complete darkness.

51:13.500 --> 51:14.860
 They like night light.

51:14.860 --> 51:17.540
 Even nocturnal animals don't like complete darkness.

51:17.540 --> 51:21.020
 I mean, we have studies in animals that are nocturnal

51:21.020 --> 51:22.580
 that if you put them in complete darkness

51:22.580 --> 51:26.460
 for several weeks, they have severe anxiety

51:26.460 --> 51:28.260
 and depression-like effect.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.060
 So keep the light dim.

51:30.060 --> 51:33.980
 You know, use red light that is very dim

51:33.980 --> 51:36.740
 if you wanna keep the room for sleeping.

51:36.740 --> 51:40.260
 Red light that is very dim has very small effect

51:40.260 --> 51:43.180
 on circadian clock.

51:43.180 --> 51:44.940
 And below 10 lux of red light

51:44.940 --> 51:47.420
 literally doesn't affect sleep at all.

51:47.420 --> 51:49.300
 So there are ways to do it.

51:49.300 --> 51:51.220
 It's just we need to educate the public.

51:51.220 --> 51:55.580
 And I feel like you literally need a whole lecture

51:55.580 --> 51:58.700
 to just explain to the people how to deal with light

51:58.700 --> 52:01.060
 because it's not as simple as people think.

52:01.060 --> 52:02.260
 Well, that's what we're doing here.

52:02.260 --> 52:03.980
 We're stepping through it piece by piece.

52:03.980 --> 52:06.420
 And the reason we're doing that

52:06.420 --> 52:08.140
 is because it's not as simple as saying

52:08.140 --> 52:10.580
 just block blue light or get a lot of light during the day.

52:10.580 --> 52:13.420
 I mean, just put it in perspective to tell it,

52:13.420 --> 52:17.220
 we only have three different cones in our retina

52:17.220 --> 52:20.020
 that respond to three different colors.

52:20.020 --> 52:23.100
 We call them red cones for simplicity,

52:23.100 --> 52:25.260
 green cones and blue cones.

52:25.260 --> 52:27.100
 Yet we have only three of these,

52:27.100 --> 52:30.620
 but we could see massive palette of colors.

52:30.620 --> 52:32.300
 So that tells you something.

52:32.300 --> 52:35.780
 If the system was just simply about a single color

52:35.780 --> 52:39.900
 and it's just removing 480 or just blue is sufficient,

52:39.900 --> 52:42.420
 then we should only see in red, yellow and blue.

52:42.420 --> 52:45.100
 We shouldn't see all these different hues of color.

52:45.100 --> 52:47.140
 But because the system is not that,

52:47.140 --> 52:49.700
 we see all these different colors.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.940
 And that's why it's important to remind people

52:51.940 --> 52:55.500
 that the white light is made of many different colors.

52:55.500 --> 52:56.940
 It's actually like the rainbow.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.020
 That's why you see the rainbow.

52:58.020 --> 52:59.660
 It's made of many colors.

52:59.660 --> 53:01.620
 White light is never truly white.

53:01.620 --> 53:03.820
 It's made of lot of different colors.

53:03.820 --> 53:05.420
 It's like the Pink Floyd album cover.

53:05.420 --> 53:07.980
 Exactly, exactly, exactly.

53:09.500 --> 53:12.980
 So dim at night, maybe dim red light ideally,

53:12.980 --> 53:16.340
 or candlelight, find that minimum required light level.

53:17.380 --> 53:19.340
 Just make sure when you lower the light,

53:19.340 --> 53:21.660
 sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.700
 Let your system adapt.

53:23.700 --> 53:26.660
 Because if you had it bright light and you switch it off,

53:26.660 --> 53:27.860
 surely you're gonna suffer

53:27.860 --> 53:29.460
 because your system didn't adapt it.

53:29.460 --> 53:31.900
 It was used to very bright light.

53:31.900 --> 53:33.820
 So you want to engage your rods,

53:33.820 --> 53:36.780
 which take a long time to dark adapt.

53:36.780 --> 53:39.620
 So that's why I tell you, just wait a little bit.

53:39.620 --> 53:42.380
 Don't just switch it off, I don't see, put it on.

53:42.380 --> 53:44.740
 Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes,

53:44.740 --> 53:48.580
 ideally 15 minutes, and then see how you see.

53:48.580 --> 53:50.300
 And then once you do that,

53:50.300 --> 53:51.940
 you will notice that actually,

53:51.940 --> 53:56.940
 yeah, I could see quite well, even with much less light.

53:57.580 --> 54:00.420
 What do you do regarding screens?

54:00.420 --> 54:02.500
 Yeah, that's the hardest thing.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.340
 Again, I mean, there are beautiful programs

54:05.340 --> 54:08.740
 that change the whole intensity and color of the screen.

54:08.740 --> 54:11.060
 These could help dim your screen at night

54:11.060 --> 54:11.980
 to the lowest part.

54:11.980 --> 54:13.500
 I mean, yes, you won't see it

54:13.500 --> 54:14.580
 when you wake up in the morning,

54:14.580 --> 54:16.820
 but then you can increase the intensity.

54:16.820 --> 54:18.220
 So try to decrease.

54:18.220 --> 54:20.740
 I mean, just what we were talking about.

54:20.740 --> 54:25.180
 Think of light intensity, duration, color, and time of day.

54:25.180 --> 54:28.780
 You really have to keep these four things together, right?

54:28.780 --> 54:31.220
 We've roomed together at a couple of meetings

54:31.220 --> 54:32.660
 from time to time, no longer,

54:32.660 --> 54:34.700
 because one of us, not to be named,

54:34.700 --> 54:36.780
 has a severe snoring issue

54:36.780 --> 54:39.420
 that made the other one pseudo homicidal.

54:41.260 --> 54:42.820
 You can guess who that was.

54:44.340 --> 54:49.340
 But I've seen you check your phone after dark once or twice,

54:49.340 --> 54:54.340
 and you did it by pointing your phone away from you, right?

54:54.460 --> 54:56.900
 And actually I'm sort of half joking,

54:56.900 --> 54:58.940
 and you dim it quite a bit.

54:58.940 --> 54:59.940
 I'm sort of half joking,

54:59.940 --> 55:01.380
 but it actually makes sense

55:01.380 --> 55:03.300
 that if you shine a flashlight in your eye,

55:03.300 --> 55:05.140
 it's much brighter than if you shine a flashlight.

55:05.140 --> 55:07.660
 So if you just look on the side,

55:07.660 --> 55:09.340
 most of the light is going to go this way,

55:09.340 --> 55:11.140
 and you're only seeing this way.

55:11.140 --> 55:14.060
 Okay, and as silly as that might seem to people listening,

55:14.060 --> 55:15.820
 I mean, what it means is that

55:15.820 --> 55:18.260
 getting bright light in your eyes at night

55:18.260 --> 55:21.020
 is something that you really want to avoid,

55:21.020 --> 55:22.980
 but there is the reality then.

55:22.980 --> 55:24.620
 And even when I check sometimes,

55:24.620 --> 55:28.180
 if I have something and I check it so fast

55:28.180 --> 55:29.260
 and switch it off so fast,

55:29.260 --> 55:31.500
 so I'm also aware of the duration.

55:31.500 --> 55:34.740
 I'm also aware of the duration, right?

55:34.740 --> 55:38.220
 So duration, intensity, color, and time of day.

55:38.220 --> 55:41.140
 Ideally, I should not check iPhones and iPads.

55:41.140 --> 55:42.580
 I don't use iPad at night

55:42.580 --> 55:44.940
 because it's hard to lower it enough,

55:44.940 --> 55:46.420
 because it's huge.

55:46.420 --> 55:49.460
 But even my iPhone, I try not to use it at night.

55:49.460 --> 55:52.420
 And like, once it becomes 8.30 or 9,

55:52.420 --> 55:53.700
 I don't look at it at all.

55:53.700 --> 55:55.540
 Unless it's World Cup or Euro Cup,

55:55.540 --> 55:57.940
 in which case, Sandra's on 24 hours, everybody.

55:57.940 --> 55:59.740
 That's only every four years.

55:59.740 --> 56:02.180
 He's a big soccer fan.

56:02.180 --> 56:06.340
 All right, this has been incredibly, no pun, illuminating.

56:07.740 --> 56:10.420
 Let's talk about the relationship between light

56:10.420 --> 56:13.580
 and some of these other non-circadian

56:13.580 --> 56:15.860
 or pseudo-circadian effects.

56:15.860 --> 56:19.140
 And we will try and link those.

56:19.140 --> 56:23.340
 But you had what I consider absolutely landmark,

56:23.340 --> 56:26.900
 beautiful paper published in Nature a few years ago,

56:26.900 --> 56:31.900
 showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light

56:32.740 --> 56:34.940
 or the timing of the exposure to light,

56:34.940 --> 56:38.100
 that there are dramatic effects on the stress system

56:38.100 --> 56:39.980
 and on the learning and memory system.

56:41.220 --> 56:44.380
 We could talk about each of those separately or together.

56:44.380 --> 56:48.020
 What are the effects on stress and the effects on learning

56:48.020 --> 56:50.940
 when light viewing behavior

56:50.940 --> 56:53.180
 and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted?

56:53.180 --> 56:54.260
 Yeah.

56:54.260 --> 56:57.500
 So just to remind you, you know that,

56:57.500 --> 56:59.260
 but to remind your listeners

56:59.260 --> 57:01.700
 that I was trained as a circadian biologist.

57:01.700 --> 57:05.820
 So I really was indoctrinated into thinking

57:05.820 --> 57:07.620
 that light has to affect the clock,

57:07.620 --> 57:10.100
 which then cause all these different effects.

57:10.100 --> 57:11.860
 So that's what I believe.

57:11.860 --> 57:12.700
 That's my dogma.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.660
 That's what would have made me really happy.

57:14.660 --> 57:18.860
 And then Tara LeGates and Cara Ultimas joined the lab

57:18.860 --> 57:21.580
 and said, and we started discussing a lot of data

57:21.580 --> 57:24.140
 and we said, what if there is a direct effect of light

57:24.140 --> 57:27.180
 that we're missing independent of the circadian clock?

57:27.180 --> 57:29.940
 So this is not an easy question to answer

57:29.940 --> 57:32.020
 because as we've been talking all along,

57:32.020 --> 57:33.620
 light affects the circadian clock.

57:33.620 --> 57:37.420
 So how could you give light at different times of the day

57:37.420 --> 57:39.260
 and not mess up the circadian clock?

57:39.260 --> 57:41.020
 Luckily, we came up with such a way

57:41.020 --> 57:44.900
 and that's why it was important to do this experiment

57:44.900 --> 57:46.420
 the way we did them.

57:46.420 --> 57:48.860
 And we proved that this light-dark cycle

57:48.860 --> 57:50.300
 does not disrupt the clock.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.420
 There is still a circadian rhythm

57:52.420 --> 57:55.860
 and does not cause sleep deprivation.

57:55.860 --> 57:58.100
 And yet, surprisingly,

57:58.100 --> 58:00.100
 if you give light at the wrong time of the day,

58:00.100 --> 58:02.740
 even without disrupting the circadian clock

58:02.740 --> 58:04.980
 or without causing sleep deprivation,

58:04.980 --> 58:08.580
 as you mentioned, you get huge mood changes

58:08.580 --> 58:12.700
 in the organisms and you get learning deficit.

58:12.700 --> 58:15.500
 So this really, and at the time,

58:15.500 --> 58:17.820
 people have really hit us hard.

58:17.820 --> 58:21.100
 I mean, it was really hard to publish this work

58:21.100 --> 58:22.700
 and you could, yeah.

58:22.700 --> 58:26.820
 Well, it came out in nature, so in the end you prevailed.

58:26.820 --> 58:28.300
 But I want to make sure that I understand.

58:28.300 --> 58:30.940
 So you're saying that, yes,

58:30.940 --> 58:33.020
 there are effects of light on the circadian rhythm.

58:33.020 --> 58:33.860
 Absolutely.

58:33.860 --> 58:35.380
 Sleep, meaning sleep and wake fullness.

58:35.380 --> 58:36.220
 Yes.

58:36.220 --> 58:37.380
 And their timing.

58:37.380 --> 58:40.820
 However, there are direct effects of light on mood

58:40.820 --> 58:42.220
 that can be dissociated

58:42.220 --> 58:44.820
 from the effects on sleep and waking.

58:44.820 --> 58:47.140
 So if I interpret that correctly,

58:47.140 --> 58:50.900
 that could mean that when we view light

58:50.900 --> 58:54.980
 and how much light could make us feel happier

58:54.980 --> 58:56.780
 or less happy or even depressed,

58:56.780 --> 58:58.540
 stress, learning, et cetera.

58:59.620 --> 59:00.460
 Bingo.

59:00.460 --> 59:01.980
 Even if we're sleeping

59:01.980 --> 59:03.860
 and waking up at the appropriate time.

59:03.860 --> 59:04.700
 Bingo.

59:04.700 --> 59:06.020
 I mean, eventually,

59:06.020 --> 59:08.020
 because we're talking about the whole system,

59:08.020 --> 59:10.380
 eventually when you start having the other problems,

59:10.380 --> 59:12.860
 you also develop sleep problems.

59:12.860 --> 59:14.140
 But you're absolutely right.

59:14.140 --> 59:17.660
 And in fact, now research from Diego Fernandez

59:17.660 --> 59:20.580
 in the lab have found that now we know

59:20.580 --> 59:23.060
 that they actually require different brain regions.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.140
 So we don't only have a theory,

59:25.140 --> 59:26.900
 we don't only have a light environment

59:26.900 --> 59:29.180
 that showed they can be dissociated.

59:29.180 --> 59:32.260
 We know that they use completely different brain regions.

59:32.260 --> 59:34.540
 So the SCN that I told you about earlier,

59:34.540 --> 59:36.660
 the place where the central pacemaker is,

59:36.660 --> 59:39.380
 the one that receives direct input from the retina

59:39.380 --> 59:43.060
 through the iPRGCs to adjust your circadian clock

59:43.060 --> 59:45.980
 is not the area that receives the light input

59:45.980 --> 59:47.020
 for mood regulation.

59:47.020 --> 59:48.980
 It's a completely different brain region.

59:48.980 --> 59:50.140
 What's the brain region called?

59:50.140 --> 59:51.020
 So the brain region,

59:51.020 --> 59:54.020
 we called it the perihabineular nucleus.

59:54.020 --> 59:55.820
 I'm not so sure how good or bad the name,

59:55.820 --> 59:57.980
 but doesn't matter, it's the PHB.

59:57.980 --> 59:59.140
 And what's really amazing,

59:59.140 --> 1:00:02.700
 this region also receives direct input from the iPRGCs,

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:04.500
 but projects to areas in the brain

1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:06.220
 that are known to regulate mood,

1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:10.540
 including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex,

1:00:10.540 --> 1:00:13.140
 which has been studied for many years

1:00:13.140 --> 1:00:15.980
 to be impacted in a human depression.

1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:19.820
 So just by this amazing serendipity

1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:24.820
 to find that a region that is so deep in the advanced brain,

1:00:25.060 --> 1:00:29.020
 like the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain,

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:32.020
 one of the most elaborated in humans,

1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:34.020
 to see that they receive input

1:00:34.020 --> 1:00:38.220
 from these ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us

1:00:38.220 --> 1:00:40.380
 and told us how much we didn't understand

1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:43.100
 the importance of light on a human behavior.

1:00:43.100 --> 1:00:47.620
 So how does that finding inform daily protocols

1:00:47.620 --> 1:00:48.940
 for you or for other people?

1:00:48.940 --> 1:00:52.460
 I realize you can't leap to always from one paper

1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:53.660
 to daily protocols,

1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:57.100
 but if light indeed does control prefrontal cortex,

1:00:57.100 --> 1:01:02.100
 executive function, learning, stress, and mood,

1:01:02.420 --> 1:01:05.180
 and let's say I'm waking up each morning and I'm sleeping,

1:01:05.180 --> 1:01:06.660
 what should I do differently?

1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:08.900
 That's why we came up with the tripartite model,

1:01:08.900 --> 1:01:12.140
 because yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock

1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:14.860
 with lights in and being dark throughout the day,

1:01:14.860 --> 1:01:16.380
 but that may not be important

1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:17.900
 for your whole physiological function.

1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:21.660
 So now if we include these other effects of light,

1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:24.700
 that's why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day.

1:01:24.700 --> 1:01:26.900
 I don't wanna be in very dim light condition

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:27.740
 throughout the day.

1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:28.580
 I see.

1:01:28.580 --> 1:01:30.660
 So even though it doesn't affect your clock,

1:01:30.660 --> 1:01:32.140
 as you beautifully said, Andrew,

1:01:32.140 --> 1:01:34.780
 it may affect your mood and learning and memory.

1:01:34.780 --> 1:01:36.580
 It may affect your alertness level,

1:01:36.580 --> 1:01:38.540
 which is gonna allow you to learn better.

1:01:38.540 --> 1:01:41.140
 It may affect your homeostatic drive.

1:01:41.140 --> 1:01:43.500
 Maybe your homeostatic factor will go higher

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:45.260
 so you could sleep earlier.

1:01:45.260 --> 1:01:47.580
 So it's important to think of light

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:49.820
 as stimulating all these brain regions,

1:01:49.820 --> 1:01:52.340
 which means it's producing more activity,

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:53.260
 which in reality,

1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:55.620
 this is how people think of the homeostatic drive,

1:01:55.620 --> 1:01:57.180
 that the more active you are,

1:01:57.180 --> 1:01:59.740
 the more the homeostatic drive is built up,

1:01:59.740 --> 1:02:01.500
 the better you sleep.

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.580
 So that's why we came up with the tripartite model,

1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:06.540
 because as a circadian biologist,

1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:07.700
 I only thought of light

1:02:07.700 --> 1:02:10.240
 through the circadian clock affecting behavior.

1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:11.300
 As a sleep biologist,

1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.460
 they only thought of the homeostatic drive

1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.780
 affecting sleep, affecting behavior.

1:02:15.780 --> 1:02:18.620
 And for people who study light for vision and other things,

1:02:18.620 --> 1:02:21.000
 they thought only of the environmental input.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.860
 But now if you put them all together,

1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:24.700
 you get with this tripartite model

1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:26.660
 where it's really mind-boggling,

1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:28.320
 and it makes so much sense.

1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:31.620
 The organism doesn't wanna depend on a single component,

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:34.700
 but if you could incorporate these three together,

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:38.080
 you could have a beautiful system that is well-adapted.

1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:40.340
 So let me tell you the sleep-wake cycle, right?

1:02:40.340 --> 1:02:43.580
 So we know there is a homeostatic drive to affect sleep.

1:02:43.580 --> 1:02:45.860
 We've had beautiful talks about that.

1:02:45.860 --> 1:02:47.460
 Which is basically the longer you're awake,

1:02:47.460 --> 1:02:48.420
 the more you wanna be asleep.

1:02:48.420 --> 1:02:50.300
 So that's your homeostatic drive.

1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:52.900
 We've talked about the circadian influence of sleep

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:54.980
 and the fact that light-dark cycle affect

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:58.060
 the circadian system, which eventually affects sleep.

1:02:58.060 --> 1:03:00.260
 So these two components are well-understood.

1:03:00.260 --> 1:03:03.180
 Now the third factor is your direct light

1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:04.780
 or environmental input.

1:03:04.780 --> 1:03:07.280
 How much stress, how much light you get from there

1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:09.640
 also can highly impact sleep.

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:13.320
 So even if you have a good circadian and homeostatic drive,

1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:15.780
 if you're getting light at the wrong time of the day,

1:03:15.780 --> 1:03:18.100
 or if you're being stressed and thinking,

1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:19.820
 then your sleep's gonna suffer.

1:03:19.820 --> 1:03:22.660
 So you have to think of the three together

1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:25.840
 to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:28.100
 And that's why we came up with the tripartite motor.

1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:29.700
 The same thing happens with feeding.

1:03:29.700 --> 1:03:31.740
 I could beautifully put it to people.

1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:34.280
 Your hunger, your energy level is measured

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.140
 by the arcuate nucleus.

1:03:36.140 --> 1:03:38.300
 Your daily intake of food is, again,

1:03:38.300 --> 1:03:41.140
 dependent on the SCN and light-dark input.

1:03:41.140 --> 1:03:43.960
 We found that if food is not available,

1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:48.540
 there is yet a third input that is not dependent on the SCN,

1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:49.780
 not dependent on the arcuate,

1:03:49.780 --> 1:03:52.820
 depending on a completely different brain regions.

1:03:52.820 --> 1:03:54.980
 So the animal can actually start looking,

1:03:54.980 --> 1:03:58.520
 or the human can start looking for food when it's scarce,

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:01.520
 even at time when they are not supposed to be active.

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:03.180
 So that's how the organism think.

1:04:03.180 --> 1:04:07.340
 They have to evaluate multiple inputs for them to decide

1:04:07.340 --> 1:04:10.320
 what is the best physiological outcome at that moment,

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:11.300
 at that season.

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:12.940
 I see.

1:04:12.940 --> 1:04:14.680
 So I wanna get into arcuate and feeding,

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:17.380
 but just to make sure we can keep our hands

1:04:17.380 --> 1:04:19.500
 around this tripartite model.

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:20.640
 So if I understand correctly,

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:23.000
 we've got the circadian influence,

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.500
 then you've also got the drive to sleep.

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:27.540
 Actually, one of the ways that I think

1:04:27.540 --> 1:04:30.700
 that can be best understood is if somebody ever pulls

1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:35.340
 an all-nighter, they get tired around 11 or 12 or so,

1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:38.500
 and then very tired around three, four a.m.,

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:40.340
 but then even if you stay up,

1:04:40.340 --> 1:04:41.980
 sometime right around seven or eight a.m.,

1:04:41.980 --> 1:04:44.140
 your normal wake-up time, you start to feel alert again.

1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:47.960
 And that's because the sleep drive is extremely strong,

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:50.380
 but there's a circadian rhythm that drives wakefulness

1:04:50.380 --> 1:04:51.220
 in the morning.

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:53.720
 Okay, so that's two of the components.

1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:55.300
 Before we get into the feeding component,

1:04:55.300 --> 1:04:58.020
 I wanna talk about these direct effects of light on mood.

1:04:58.020 --> 1:04:59.880
 Okay, Diego Fernandez's data.

1:05:01.100 --> 1:05:03.560
 And this perihabenular thing.

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:06.240
 So let's just, for the moment,

1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:08.740
 set aside the tri part of the tripartite model

1:05:08.740 --> 1:05:10.860
 and just focus on what are the direct effects

1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:12.180
 of light on mood?

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:14.340
 And the way that I interpret what you've said so far

1:05:14.340 --> 1:05:16.580
 is that the protocol that emerges from this,

1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:19.120
 if one is trying to optimize their mood,

1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:21.980
 is yes, see light, view light, I should say,

1:05:21.980 --> 1:05:24.560
 early in the day in order to set your circadian clock,

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:26.540
 maybe also in the evening as well.

1:05:26.540 --> 1:05:28.660
 And of course, avoid light at night,

1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:30.460
 get it as dim as possible.

1:05:30.460 --> 1:05:35.380
 However, you said it's also a good idea

1:05:35.380 --> 1:05:37.260
 to get as much bright light during the day

1:05:37.260 --> 1:05:40.560
 as you safely can in order to improve your mood

1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:43.140
 independently of regulating your sleep-wake cycle.

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:44.340
 And that's a hypothesis.

1:05:44.340 --> 1:05:46.140
 Here's the problem where it's not gonna be

1:05:46.140 --> 1:05:48.280
 as satisfying as the circadian,

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:49.980
 is that, as you know, this brain region

1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:52.060
 has been discovered very recently.

1:05:52.060 --> 1:05:52.900
 Habenula.

1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:54.020
 The perihabenular region.

1:05:54.020 --> 1:05:55.260
 We've known about it a long time,

1:05:55.260 --> 1:05:56.260
 but nobody knew what it did.

1:05:56.260 --> 1:05:57.780
 So we knew about the habenula,

1:05:57.780 --> 1:05:59.740
 but that's why the name is confusing.

1:05:59.740 --> 1:06:01.680
 It's actually not the habenula itself.

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:02.660
 It's the perihabenula.

1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:03.500
 No, near the habenula.

1:06:03.500 --> 1:06:04.340
 It's near the habenula.

1:06:04.340 --> 1:06:06.180
 Why don't you just call it the Samaratatar nucleus?

1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:08.500
 I should have, I don't know why I've done that.

1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:10.480
 Maybe because if you do that, it's not okay.

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:14.460
 Okay, so for herever after, the perihabenular nucleus,

1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:16.220
 we should probably call it the hotar-

1:06:16.220 --> 1:06:17.340
 The hotar fernandas.

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:19.500
 How about hotar fernandas bursa nucleus?

1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:22.100
 Okay, this is like nerdy science attribution stuff,

1:06:22.100 --> 1:06:24.700
 but I'm just gonna call it the hotar nucleus.

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:26.060
 Wikipedia, line it up.

1:06:27.060 --> 1:06:29.340
 Okay, so this structure is taking light

1:06:29.340 --> 1:06:32.320
 and independent of sleep rhythms and circadian rhythms,

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:34.140
 it's driving changes in mood.

1:06:34.140 --> 1:06:35.020
 How does it do that?

1:06:35.020 --> 1:06:36.460
 Is this through the dopamine system,

1:06:36.460 --> 1:06:37.620
 the serotonin system?

1:06:37.620 --> 1:06:38.940
 We still recently,

1:06:38.940 --> 1:06:41.100
 we haven't identified this region very well.

1:06:41.100 --> 1:06:43.180
 We don't know what light does to it.

1:06:43.180 --> 1:06:44.700
 We don't know how it interacts.

1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:47.620
 So this is an area that is ripe for discoveries

1:06:47.620 --> 1:06:49.620
 and we're working on this right now.

1:06:49.620 --> 1:06:51.780
 But that's why I said it's not satisfying.

1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:54.020
 This is like the function of sleep.

1:06:54.020 --> 1:06:55.200
 Why do we sleep?

1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:57.040
 We know sleep is very important to us,

1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:59.160
 but we still don't have a satisfying function

1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:00.860
 of why do we sleep, right?

1:07:00.860 --> 1:07:03.460
 I see, but the why questions,

1:07:03.460 --> 1:07:05.640
 I think it's our good friend and colleague

1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:07.320
 at University of Washington, Russ Van Gelder,

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:09.380
 who always says, when somebody asks why,

1:07:09.380 --> 1:07:11.120
 the best answer is just to say,

1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:13.060
 I wasn't consulted at the design phase.

1:07:13.060 --> 1:07:13.900
 Exactly.

1:07:13.900 --> 1:07:15.060
 Right, none of us really know why.

1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:17.700
 No, but the point is, maybe I shouldn't have said why.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.220
 What is the function of sleep?

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:21.340
 It's still very hard to know.

1:07:21.340 --> 1:07:24.700
 Why would, what is the reason organisms

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:27.260
 have to go offline for so long?

1:07:28.140 --> 1:07:29.900
 You know, people assume it's for repair,

1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:31.420
 assume it's for learning and memory,

1:07:31.420 --> 1:07:32.740
 assume all kinds of stuff,

1:07:32.740 --> 1:07:37.240
 but there is really no clear function for sleeping.

1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.860
 There is no clear function for sleeping.

1:07:39.860 --> 1:07:42.380
 I mean, if you talk to people, there are hypotheses.

1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:44.340
 I mean, all we know is that if you don't sleep,

1:07:44.340 --> 1:07:46.820
 or your sleep is very fractured, you get messed up.

1:07:46.820 --> 1:07:48.440
 And you could die even, right?

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:51.700
 I mean, it's really bad if you don't sleep,

1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:54.800
 but we don't know what is the function,

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:58.260
 what is that sleep have gone to organisms

1:07:58.260 --> 1:08:00.740
 that couldn't have done with rest?

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:03.000
 What if you just could rest without sleeping,

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.140
 just sit down and rest?

1:08:04.140 --> 1:08:05.780
 Well, my lab's trying to figure out

1:08:05.780 --> 1:08:08.020
 whether or not these non-sleep deep rest protocols

1:08:08.020 --> 1:08:09.700
 can compensate for sleep.

1:08:09.700 --> 1:08:12.100
 And I mean, obviously sleep is better,

1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:14.580
 but many people are not getting the sleep that they need.

1:08:14.580 --> 1:08:18.320
 But okay, so, and if people are sensing

1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:19.980
 that Samir and I are about to start talking

1:08:19.980 --> 1:08:21.020
 over each other and arguing,

1:08:21.020 --> 1:08:23.500
 that's always the goal when we talk, right?

1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:25.500
 Unlike other scientists I interact with,

1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:26.680
 when Samir and I get together,

1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:28.900
 it's considered a successful conversation

1:08:28.900 --> 1:08:31.700
 if we get into a big fight and then go for a big meal

1:08:31.700 --> 1:08:33.240
 where I pick the restaurant.

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:38.100
 Okay, so let's talk about food and eating and appetite.

1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:42.560
 You had yet another, yes,

1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:45.820
 I greatly admire your success in this way.

1:08:45.820 --> 1:08:48.740
 Yet another incredible discovery showing

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:52.860
 that there are direct, excuse me, effects of light

1:08:52.860 --> 1:08:55.220
 on appetite and feeding behavior.

1:08:55.220 --> 1:08:58.460
 Maybe you could just summarize those results for people.

1:08:58.460 --> 1:09:00.600
 Honestly, that paper is the one that allowed us

1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:02.140
 to come with the tripartite model

1:09:02.140 --> 1:09:04.860
 because we were thinking completely wrong about it.

1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:08.660
 We wanted, this experiment, it'd be fun for your audience

1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:10.880
 to hear why we started this experiment.

1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:14.020
 Remember that when we discovered the IPRGCs,

1:09:14.020 --> 1:09:17.200
 we figured if they are the only relay

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.260
 to entrain the circadian clock,

1:09:19.260 --> 1:09:22.740
 then you could kill them and have an animal opposite

1:09:22.740 --> 1:09:24.900
 to the one that we spoke, or a human opposite

1:09:24.900 --> 1:09:26.380
 to the one that we spoke about earlier,

1:09:26.380 --> 1:09:29.380
 where instead of having no pattern vision

1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:31.540
 and have circadian photo entrainment,

1:09:31.540 --> 1:09:33.960
 we could produce an animal that have pattern vision

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:36.080
 but no circadian photo entrainment.

1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:37.560
 So circadian blind.

1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:40.740
 Circadian blind, but pattern sighted.

1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:42.820
 And we succeeded in that.

1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:44.500
 The problem when you have these animals,

1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:46.820
 which I've told you many times already,

1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:49.660
 is that they don't adjust to the day-night cycle.

1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:53.420
 So doing experiments on them become very complicated.

1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:55.780
 What is their behavior like if you don't have these cells?

1:09:55.780 --> 1:09:57.180
 Are they awake and then asleep, awake and then asleep?

1:09:57.180 --> 1:09:59.780
 They just drift like the humans we've talked about.

1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:01.220
 They think they're in Las Vegas.

1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:02.940
 They drift, exactly.

1:10:02.940 --> 1:10:04.420
 They stay up later every night.

1:10:04.420 --> 1:10:06.380
 They come either, depends on their clock.

1:10:06.380 --> 1:10:08.620
 If their clock is shorter, they come in earlier.

1:10:08.620 --> 1:10:10.140
 If their clock is longer, they come in.

1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:11.160
 So they're really messed up.

1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:12.960
 They really don't adjust to the,

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.140
 if they were in the wild,

1:10:14.140 --> 1:10:16.000
 they'll be eliminated in a second, right?

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000
 There is no way they'll survive.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.900
 So me and Diego started talking and we're like,

1:10:20.900 --> 1:10:23.640
 what if we use non-light entraining agent?

1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:26.860
 And what is the strong non-light entraining agent?

1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:28.020
 Food.

1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:32.660
 So we thought that the light-defective animals

1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:34.860
 will have more sensitivity to food entrainment

1:10:34.860 --> 1:10:36.440
 because as you know more than me,

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.860
 this is an area that you've worked really well on.

1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:41.020
 For vision, if you're image-blind,

1:10:41.020 --> 1:10:44.860
 your hearing and somatosensory get improved, right?

1:10:44.860 --> 1:10:49.660
 The lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation.

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:51.340
 But we found actually that

1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:53.400
 if you don't have the light system,

1:10:54.540 --> 1:10:56.140
 actually you're feeding,

1:10:56.140 --> 1:10:57.900
 the food ability to entrain the animal

1:10:57.900 --> 1:10:59.820
 goes completely to the ground,

1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:02.740
 completely opposite to what we predicted.

1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:06.400
 So light viewing and feeding behavior

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:08.860
 are interacting in ways that support one another.

1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:10.980
 And that's why we came with the tripartite model.

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:12.260
 We figured it's different

1:11:12.260 --> 1:11:14.280
 than sensation of the environment.

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:15.740
 When you sense with vision,

1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:17.660
 vision and hearing interact,

1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:20.180
 but your vision is a real full modality.

1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:23.180
 You want to see, that's what vision want to do.

1:11:23.180 --> 1:11:25.620
 You want to hear, that's what hearing want to do.

1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:28.260
 You want to sense, that's what sensing want to do.

1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:32.340
 But for the circadian system, light, food,

1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:33.820
 all these entraining agent,

1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:38.280
 they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system.

1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:40.180
 You don't just assume if you remove light,

1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:41.420
 this one is going to be stronger.

1:11:41.420 --> 1:11:43.700
 No, they need to know each other's.

1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:46.380
 The light informs when the animal's going to eat.

1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:49.200
 Well, what I like about this so much is that,

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:52.580
 you know, in the other, in the world outside of science,

1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:55.220
 in which I don't really exist in,

1:11:55.220 --> 1:11:57.740
 but that I see a lot of this kind of wellness,

1:11:57.740 --> 1:11:58.620
 you know, stuff with this,

1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:00.840
 all this mind-body integration stuff.

1:12:01.940 --> 1:12:05.060
 It's interesting because people view the body

1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:06.580
 more as a system, right?

1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.400
 A system of organs that interact,

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:11.540
 as opposed to the way that standard science

1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:13.140
 and medical profession is like,

1:12:13.140 --> 1:12:15.740
 you work on the liver or your ear, nose and throat,

1:12:15.740 --> 1:12:18.340
 or heart and lung, or brain, or.

1:12:18.340 --> 1:12:20.060
 That's a great way of thinking.

1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:22.060
 But the biology is integrated.

1:12:22.060 --> 1:12:22.900
 Yeah.

1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:26.700
 I mean, and so for somebody who's interested

1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:29.340
 in affecting their eating behavior,

1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:31.620
 something that you are familiar with

1:12:31.620 --> 1:12:33.940
 and that we will talk more about your experiences of

1:12:33.940 --> 1:12:34.780
 in a moment,

1:12:36.300 --> 1:12:37.940
 how should they use light

1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:40.660
 in order to adjust their eating behavior?

1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:41.500
 Right.

1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:44.180
 So now that I've told you about all these interactions

1:12:44.180 --> 1:12:47.780
 between the different inputs to the circadian clock,

1:12:47.780 --> 1:12:49.740
 just you think about it as an engineer,

1:12:49.740 --> 1:12:51.300
 what would be the best thing?

1:12:51.300 --> 1:12:53.260
 The best thing is to know

1:12:53.260 --> 1:12:56.100
 when your food times happen in the day,

1:12:56.100 --> 1:12:57.380
 when should you get light,

1:12:57.380 --> 1:13:02.060
 and when is your circadian clock in your system, right?

1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:05.500
 So if you eat at very specific times of the day,

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:08.140
 that's another signal that is telling your body,

1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.620
 your clock, you're in a certain time of the day.

1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:13.320
 So if you're having lunch at the correct time every day,

1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:14.620
 and you're getting bright light,

1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:18.060
 now you have two systems that are informing your clock,

1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:19.540
 your clock is gonna be better.

1:13:19.540 --> 1:13:21.020
 So regular meal times.

1:13:21.020 --> 1:13:24.180
 Regular meal times that fit your circadian clock.

1:13:24.180 --> 1:13:26.380
 So, and in fact, if you do that,

1:13:26.380 --> 1:13:28.380
 when I started doing this,

1:13:28.380 --> 1:13:30.100
 and it helped me lose weight,

1:13:30.100 --> 1:13:31.700
 is that I'm exposing myself

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:34.020
 to the right amount of light, dark cycle.

1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:35.940
 I'm eating at regular time.

1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:37.020
 It is amazing.

1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:38.140
 You will be not hungry,

1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:39.620
 let's say you eat at noon.

1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:42.620
 You will not feel any hunger at 11.45,

1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:45.220
 and then all of a sudden the hunger jumps.

1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:47.100
 This is clearly not an energy issue

1:13:47.100 --> 1:13:49.380
 because it could not be that drastic.

1:13:49.380 --> 1:13:51.540
 Right, no, the desire to eat is mainly driven

1:13:51.540 --> 1:13:55.940
 by these cues, these hormone cues,

1:13:55.940 --> 1:14:00.860
 that are very exquisitely timed to sleep-wake cycle,

1:14:00.860 --> 1:14:02.300
 but also to light.

1:14:02.300 --> 1:14:03.140
 Exactly.

1:14:03.140 --> 1:14:04.540
 And you know, in the wild,

1:14:04.540 --> 1:14:06.420
 you could imagine why energy level

1:14:06.420 --> 1:14:08.420
 through the arcuate nucleus-

1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:10.120
 You should explain to people what the arcuate is,

1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:11.940
 because I don't think we've done that adequately.

1:14:11.940 --> 1:14:14.300
 The arcuate nucleus is an area of the hypothalamus

1:14:14.300 --> 1:14:16.720
 that drives hunger and feeding behavior.

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.300
 And what we're talking about is the fact

1:14:18.300 --> 1:14:23.140
 that it's taking cues from your viewing of light,

1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:26.260
 believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger.

1:14:26.260 --> 1:14:29.900
 And this is a non-trivial way

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.860
 in which your timing of hunger and amount of hunger

1:14:32.860 --> 1:14:36.780
 is regulated by when and how much light you view.

1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:38.780
 So let me ask you a couple of practical-

1:14:38.780 --> 1:14:41.260
 Can I just, this is really, before you ask me,

1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:43.500
 sorry, Andrew, we said we're going to fight,

1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:46.980
 but to me, it's the interesting thing to think about it.

1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:48.980
 In the wild, when you didn't have the availability

1:14:48.980 --> 1:14:50.660
 of food that we have,

1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:53.220
 the arcuate plays a huge, important role,

1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:57.380
 because if you weren't successful in getting food,

1:14:57.380 --> 1:14:58.620
 then the arc is going to tell you,

1:14:58.620 --> 1:15:01.160
 look, you have to take risk and go get food

1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:03.220
 because your energy level is very low.

1:15:03.220 --> 1:15:04.100
 And that's great.

1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:06.420
 That's tons of great research about that.

1:15:06.420 --> 1:15:09.660
 But I think what's missing is the fact in humans,

1:15:09.660 --> 1:15:12.800
 we're not getting to a situation, most of us,

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.060
 we're not getting to a situation

1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:16.400
 where we have low energy levels.

1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:19.340
 Most of the time, actually, we eat not because we want to,

1:15:19.340 --> 1:15:21.420
 because we really have low energy,

1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:23.020
 but because we want to eat.

1:15:23.020 --> 1:15:26.360
 So I think that's why I feel that the timing

1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:28.020
 is very important for us

1:15:28.020 --> 1:15:31.540
 because we always have enough energy level for us to eat.

1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:33.860
 Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much that I'll eat

1:15:33.860 --> 1:15:35.860
 just for the sensation of chewing.

1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:38.260
 I mean, I enjoy the taste too,

1:15:38.260 --> 1:15:40.960
 and I enjoy the social aspects when those are a part of it,

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.800
 but I literally enjoy the physical act of chewing,

1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:46.160
 absolutely.

1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:47.500
 Which explains a lot.

1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:53.700
 Okay, so how regular are you,

1:15:53.700 --> 1:15:56.240
 or do you recommend people be about meal times?

1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:01.020
 Because what I'm hearing is that light viewing behavior

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:01.940
 is pretty straightforward.

1:16:01.940 --> 1:16:03.880
 Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day,

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:07.380
 minimize it in the evening and at night, generally speaking,

1:16:07.380 --> 1:16:09.120
 for sake of mood and circadian rhythm,

1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:14.120
 but for sake of regulating timing and quality,

1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:15.760
 I should also say a food intake,

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.520
 because people clearly make better choices

1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:20.700
 about food intake when they are anticipating a meal

1:16:20.700 --> 1:16:22.680
 and they aren't constantly hungry.

1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:24.760
 And so the ability to regulate hunger

1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:27.080
 for particular phases of the circadian cycle

1:16:27.080 --> 1:16:29.120
 is quite valuable for all people,

1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:32.300
 not just people trying to lose weight, but all people.

1:16:32.300 --> 1:16:33.980
 Are we talking about down to the minute?

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:34.820
 Like if I-

1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:35.640
 Absolutely not.

1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:40.000
 All right, so 12 noon is my normal lunch, let's say,

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.400
 plus or minus?

1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:42.240
 Half an hour.

1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:43.080
 Okay.

1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:45.720
 So eat around between 11.30 and 12.30.

1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:47.960
 If that's the time, and it depends,

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:49.600
 if you also do multiple meals.

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.000
 Remember, three meals, that's a decision

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.440
 that somebody came up with.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:54.280
 I don't know why.

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:56.400
 Nowadays, fewer people are doing that, I think.

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:57.240
 Yeah.

1:16:57.240 --> 1:16:59.000
 Given our friend Sachin Panda's work.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.220
 Right, I mean, so you could have two meals.

1:17:01.220 --> 1:17:04.760
 You could have very multiple meals

1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:07.920
 that are distributed across your active time.

1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:10.720
 I agree with Sachin Panda's work

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:13.260
 that try to avoid eating when your system

1:17:13.260 --> 1:17:14.840
 is supposed to be relaxing,

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:18.560
 when you're supposed to be at non-active time.

1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:21.000
 So, you know, limit your eating

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.600
 to the active time of your cycle.

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:24.960
 And that seemed to be,

1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:28.160
 and Joe Takahashi is doing some beautiful stuff on this.

1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.100
 That seems to be incredibly important

1:17:30.100 --> 1:17:33.300
 for aspect of the circadian-

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:34.140
 And for health.

1:17:34.140 --> 1:17:34.960
 And for health.

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:35.800
 Yeah, I mean, Sachin,

1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:37.520
 we're referring to Sachin Panda's work.

1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:39.840
 He wrote a beautiful book called The Circadian Code.

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.480
 Maybe, Samer, with some luck,

1:17:41.480 --> 1:17:43.440
 you'll write a book as well,

1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:46.080
 meaning the world would be lucky to have that book.

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:49.580
 But Sachin's data really strongly points to the fact

1:17:49.580 --> 1:17:52.960
 that liver health, brain health,

1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:56.180
 metabolic factors and endocrine factors

1:17:56.180 --> 1:17:58.580
 of various systems and organs

1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:00.720
 all seem to benefit from having a period

1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:03.620
 of each 24-hour day in which we are not eating anything

1:18:03.620 --> 1:18:05.620
 and then eating at very regular times.

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:08.560
 Let's talk about eating in meal times

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:10.280
 and let's move a little bit away

1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:12.120
 from the science for the moment,

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:13.440
 although we will return to it,

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:16.660
 and talk a little bit more about your experience

1:18:16.660 --> 1:18:18.480
 with eating in meal times.

1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:21.440
 So you're looking in good shape lately.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:22.280
 Thank you.

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:23.520
 I know you've been putting work into it.

1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:24.360
 Yeah.

1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:25.920
 We talk a lot and you've been exercising

1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:30.480
 and you've been eating well, meaning quality food.

1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:31.540
 You just came back from Jordan

1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:33.480
 where I'm assuming the food is amazing.

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:34.440
 It's the food is amazing.

1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:37.760
 And honestly, usually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan,

1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:40.000
 but this time I didn't gain any weight,

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.840
 which was really nice, so.

1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:45.120
 Yeah, when I met you,

1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:49.800
 you were probably about 100 pounds heavier than you are now.

1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:53.800
 Yeah, 275 pounds, I'm 219 now, it's crazy.

1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:54.920
 You had a lot of vigor then

1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:56.680
 and you have a lot of vigor now,

1:18:56.680 --> 1:19:01.520
 but I know that you undertook a very specific protocol

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:03.720
 in order to lose the weight.

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:06.280
 Based on your understanding of the circadian system

1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:09.160
 and of light and appetite and mood,

1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:10.520
 maybe you could just tell us a little bit

1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:12.280
 about what that schedule looks like.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.960
 And we realize that this is not a prescriptive for everybody,

1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:17.000
 but you found what worked for you.

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:17.840
 Yeah.

1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:18.760
 Maybe just describe those changes.

1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:21.560
 I mean, honestly, I followed my circadian cycle, right,

1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:23.960
 of what we've talked about, right?

1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:25.800
 So I dimmed the light at night.

1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:27.920
 I slept at regular hours.

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:31.020
 I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch

1:19:31.020 --> 1:19:33.640
 when I'm really active and I'm really hungry.

1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.720
 And at night, when I avoid dinner

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:38.320
 because my circadian system really shuts off at three,

1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:39.860
 I'm an early person,

1:19:39.860 --> 1:19:42.360
 like you could give me anything I would eat before three.

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.760
 After three, nothing appeals to me anymore.

1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:46.080
 My system is shut off.

1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:47.240
 What time are you going to sleep

1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:48.080
 and what time are you waking up?

1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:50.440
 Oh, so in my case, I should have put this up.

1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:53.360
 I mean, I go to sleep literally at 9 p.m.

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:56.560
 I mean, I literally, five minutes after 9 p.m.,

1:19:56.560 --> 1:19:58.380
 I'm completely out.

1:19:58.380 --> 1:20:01.000
 And I wake up between 4.30 and 5.00 a.m.

1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:03.560
 So if I extend it, I go to 6.00 a.m.

1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:06.600
 But very rarely, depends on how tired I was.

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:10.600
 And that, as I recall, was an important set of changes

1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:12.800
 for you to be able to regulate your food intake.

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:16.760
 Absolutely, because then I'm having very big breakfast

1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:19.440
 and again, for different people, it's different.

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:22.840
 I have a big breakfast at 7 a.m. maximum.

1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:25.840
 So I have a big breakfast, coffee and all this stuff.

1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:29.020
 Then I have some simple snack around 10.

1:20:29.020 --> 1:20:32.800
 Then I have regularly lunch at noon or between noon to one.

1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:34.360
 Then I have another snack at three.

1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:36.200
 And the hardest time to regulate the food

1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:37.400
 is between 12 and three.

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:39.520
 This is when I really feel hungry.

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:41.500
 This is your equivalent of kind of late evening

1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:42.340
 for most people.

1:20:42.340 --> 1:20:44.560
 So for me, it would probably be between seven and 10 p.m.

1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:46.360
 Exactly, exactly.

1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.980
 And then at night, I'm completely not hungry.

1:20:48.980 --> 1:20:52.620
 But usually, as you said, the enjoyment of food.

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:56.080
 Like when my wife cooks some really beautiful Indian food,

1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:58.160
 I eat, but I'm not hungry.

1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:01.120
 And I notice if I eat with that, I usually gain weight.

1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:04.400
 But if I regulate that at night, I also lose weight.

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:07.000
 So there is a combination of all these things

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.240
 that help you adjust the input of food,

1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:13.640
 the input of light, the input of the clock

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:14.880
 and the drive to hunger.

1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:17.440
 Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that.

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:19.440
 And I want to emphasize that some people

1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:21.160
 are not hungry early in the day.

1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:22.640
 They might be late shifted people.

1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:24.100
 In which case, eating later in the day

1:21:24.100 --> 1:21:24.940
 will work well for them.

1:21:24.940 --> 1:21:27.440
 It will work as long as they don't eat early in the morning.

1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:29.840
 That's just, you have to work with your schedule,

1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:31.400
 with your active schedule.

1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:32.800
 Yeah, you and I have been talking about this

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:33.720
 offline for years.

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:36.680
 I'm glad we're finally having this discussion publicly now.

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:37.680
 What we're talking about really

1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:39.800
 is finding your ideal sleep schedule.

1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:40.680
 Exactly.

1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:43.120
 And finding your ideal eating schedule.

1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:43.960
 Exactly.

1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:46.400
 And understanding how those two things interact.

1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:48.040
 And you know, the nice thing, as you said,

1:21:48.040 --> 1:21:49.680
 finding them out is going to help you

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:51.360
 to understand how they interact.

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:53.480
 Because we know from the Tripartite model

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:55.840
 that they are all interconnected.

1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:57.040
 And for each person,

1:21:57.040 --> 1:21:59.600
 they're going to be interconnected differently.

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:03.680
 So for each person, you would, you know, for me,

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:05.340
 if I exercise at night,

1:22:05.340 --> 1:22:07.000
 I'm going to mess up my whole system.

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:07.840
 Believe it.

1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:08.660
 So when do you exercise?

1:22:08.660 --> 1:22:09.500
 Morning.

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:10.440
 Morning works great for me.

1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:11.800
 I mean, it's amazing.

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:14.800
 Morning exercise for me works great.

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:17.240
 I tried one time because it was easier for me

1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:19.240
 to exercise at night before I leave

1:22:19.240 --> 1:22:21.360
 when the traffic is there from the night.

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:22.740
 And I think that messed me up

1:22:22.740 --> 1:22:24.640
 because I couldn't sleep well,

1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:26.040
 and I couldn't wake up well,

1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:27.840
 and that led to more changes in my food.

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:30.840
 I gained weight again, actually, believe it or not,

1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:32.600
 even though I was exercising.

1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:35.360
 So I think this really makes me think

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.160
 that you have to think of the Tripartite model

1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:41.320
 to see where is the best times

1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:43.200
 and what is the best interrelation

1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:45.880
 between the different component, as you beautifully said,

1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:48.320
 between your meal times, your light exposure,

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:50.800
 and your sleep that works for you.

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:51.620
 Well, thank you for that.

1:22:51.620 --> 1:22:53.360
 Usually Samir's insulting me today.

1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:54.560
 He's complimenting me.

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:57.120
 I'm going to compliment him right back by saying,

1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:01.480
 this is the first time that I've ever really understood

1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:04.460
 how, yes, light can control sleep.

1:23:04.460 --> 1:23:06.240
 Yes, it can control mood.

1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:09.040
 Yes, it can impact feeding,

1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:11.700
 but that it's really about doing the self-exploration

1:23:11.700 --> 1:23:14.560
 to align those in the way that works best.

1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:16.520
 And what I'm hearing, tell me if I'm wrong,

1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:19.320
 but what I'm hearing is that once you understand

1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:21.960
 what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle,

1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:25.500
 then you should exercise during the period of time

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:27.640
 in which you feel most alert.

1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:30.680
 And if it works for your schedule,

1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:32.900
 ideally you would also eat during the time

1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:35.800
 in which you feel most alert and then stop eating

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:38.280
 and stop light viewing behavior as you head towards sleep.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:39.120
 Right.

1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:42.240
 So the only thing I would say that complicates all of this,

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:45.100
 and that's what makes me sad, is your light exposure.

1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:45.940
 Mine personally?

1:23:45.940 --> 1:23:47.640
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:49.860
 The people's light exposure, right?

1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:51.400
 This is what complicates it

1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:55.000
 because you're not going to be able to figure all this out

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.740
 if you're shifting yourself out of your comfort zone

1:23:57.740 --> 1:24:01.240
 by viewing light at the wrong time of the day.

1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:06.240
 So let's say if you were under an idle natural conditions,

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.240
 you're a person who would sleep later than me,

1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:12.960
 let's say we'll sleep at midnight and wake up at 8 a.m.

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:15.000
 Let's say you don't eat anything till noon,

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.860
 and as you said, you eat late in the evening,

1:24:17.860 --> 1:24:19.600
 then this would be perfect for you.

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:21.440
 But now see what happens

1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:23.320
 if now you include the light component.

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:26.820
 Now if you push your sleep from midnight to 4 a.m.,

1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:29.280
 now you're waking up in the morning

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:31.880
 and you're actually really not the morning,

1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:35.040
 you're working up, sorry, at noon instead of eight o'clock,

1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:37.480
 and the time where you're not supposed to be hungry,

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.740
 now you're gonna start eating directly at noon

1:24:39.740 --> 1:24:42.260
 or something like that, or even delay it.

1:24:42.260 --> 1:24:43.960
 And now you're shifting your whole cycle

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:45.680
 and you don't know if this interaction

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:48.440
 between your sleep feeding and the light dark environment

1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:50.600
 are still gonna be maintained or not.

1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:52.520
 And that's the problem that people have.

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:56.680
 So as I'm hearing this, what I'm realizing is most of us,

1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:00.400
 probably me included, are messing up at least one,

1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:02.440
 two, or three of these components.

1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:06.480
 But that the probe, the way to figure out

1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:08.000
 what's right for oneself

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.640
 is to start manipulating light exposure.

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:13.880
 And I'm gonna be honest, I'm biased,

1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:18.000
 because I believe that light is the strongest time giver.

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.600
 And a lot of people disagree.

1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:21.080
 Some people think feeding is.

1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:23.360
 I always thought that light was the primary zeitgeber,

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.200
 the primary light.

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:25.800
 Yeah, but a lot of people think it's food.

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:28.600
 A lot of people even sometimes mention social interactions.

1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:29.960
 And they read the literature?

1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:31.040
 I agree with you.

1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:32.440
 I totally agree with you.

1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:33.940
 I mean, my understanding is that light

1:25:33.940 --> 1:25:36.040
 is the most powerful driver of the things we're talking about.

1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:38.680
 That's why I think we need to regulate this first

1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:40.420
 and everything else fits.

1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:42.200
 And you know, the nice thing is that

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:45.820
 your sleep-wake cycle and exercise tell you really bluntly

1:25:45.820 --> 1:25:47.200
 if you're doing it right or not.

1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:48.120
 Tell me more about that.

1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:48.960
 I'll tell you more.

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:51.440
 When I shifted my exercise,

1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:54.280
 honestly, things fell apart like never before.

1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:56.600
 When you moved from exercising early in the day

1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:57.520
 to late in the day.

1:25:57.520 --> 1:25:59.480
 It completely fell apart for me.

1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:01.480
 I didn't enjoy exercise at night.

1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:04.280
 My pain tolerance for exercise wasn't as good.

1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:06.480
 I'm talking with N equals one, and I'm aware of this.

1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:08.680
 I've never tested this empirically.

1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:12.360
 But at least to me, it really messed up everything.

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:13.480
 I started having problems,

1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:15.560
 because my body temperature will go up,

1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:17.000
 and that will affect my sleep.

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.440
 I possibly was running in the gym with a lot of lights,

1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:21.400
 so maybe the light was a component.

1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.680
 But for me, exercising in the morning,

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:26.520
 it's so much better for me.

1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.220
 But a lot of people can't even think

1:26:28.220 --> 1:26:29.760
 of exercising in the morning.

1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:31.960
 So it depends on when you feel comfortable

1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:34.160
 in your sleep-wake cycle and your exercise.

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:35.880
 I think that tells you if your system

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:38.480
 is in synchrony with one another.

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:39.480
 That's really interesting.

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.120
 You know, we're good friends.

1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:43.660
 Our friend Pat Dossett, right, that we both know,

1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:45.720
 you know, did nine years in the SEAL teams,

1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:47.120
 and he's one of these people.

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.380
 He says, you know, he's happy to go for a run or swim

1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:52.560
 any time between 4.30 a.m. and 6 a.m.

1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:54.160
 And he'll train in the afternoon, too,

1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:55.800
 because, you know, he's a SEAL team guy,

1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:57.380
 and they'll do whatever any time.

1:26:57.380 --> 1:26:58.820
 That's part of the phenotype.

1:26:58.820 --> 1:27:01.480
 But he feels best doing that, right?

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:04.360
 I'm a mid, I like to exercise mid-morning,

1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:08.160
 and I'm happy to skip eating until 12 or one.

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.160
 And I like to go to sleep around 11, 30, 12,

1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:12.020
 because I'm a normal human being rather than you

1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:12.860
 who goes to bed at 9 p.m.

1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:15.960
 What about Pat, actually, I've never asked him what time.

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:18.080
 So, Pat's ideal to sleep time.

1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:20.800
 I've asked him, this would be around 8.30 or 9.

1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:21.800
 Oh, I sound like Pat.

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:25.880
 No, but he has, yes, but he has two young children,

1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:27.600
 two years old and a newborn,

1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:29.680
 and so the cycle is disrupted, right?

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:31.320
 Yeah, but that's known, right?

1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:33.480
 I mean, the effect of childbearing,

1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:35.600
 and I think we could talk about this,

1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:39.080
 that's more complicated, but that's pretty much, yeah.

1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:41.520
 Yeah, I mean, I think we need to come up with a new name

1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:44.840
 for a chronotype, because chronotype implies

1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:47.000
 that it's just about sleep and wake,

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.800
 being an early bird or a night owl,

1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:51.200
 and what we're also talking about is how exercise

1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:53.000
 and eating match onto those.

1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:54.800
 And the phase relation between them.

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:56.840
 Right.

1:27:56.840 --> 1:27:59.400
 And the phases between different components, as you said.

1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:00.400
 Because they interact.

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:01.240
 Because they interact.

1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:02.060
 Right.

1:28:02.060 --> 1:28:03.480
 And they don't have to be in the same phase.

1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:05.520
 Like, let's say my light and food

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:06.960
 could be very close to each other's,

1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:09.320
 your light and food could be different, right?

1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:11.840
 The phases don't have to be, they can't be plastic.

1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:14.120
 So you have to find this for yourself.

1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:17.000
 You may be a person who eats late at night,

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.920
 exercises late at night,

1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:21.480
 or you may be a person who exercises early, eat later.

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:25.200
 So it doesn't, as long as the phase is good,

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:27.320
 that's what you have to find out.

1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:28.880
 Okay, and if I understand correctly,

1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.320
 when you're talking about phase relationship,

1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:34.080
 it means you want to lump exercise, feeding, and light for-

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:34.920
 And sleep.

1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:37.360
 And sleep, in a way that,

1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:39.600
 as a coherent and total system,

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:41.160
 makes you feel really good.

1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:43.260
 Temporally, in a great order.

1:28:43.260 --> 1:28:44.100
 Uh-huh.

1:28:44.100 --> 1:28:44.920
 Absolutely.

1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:45.760
 Yeah, that's, and I think that-

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:47.520
 And I could tell you, to me,

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:50.880
 is literally getting exposed to sun,

1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:52.480
 you know, clearly in the morning,

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:53.960
 clearly at noon I go out,

1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:57.400
 I keep my windows in the office completely open,

1:28:57.400 --> 1:28:59.760
 eating mostly in the early time of the day,

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.400
 and exercising, and literally at the end part of the day,

1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:07.640
 I'm literally in a more thoughtful, vegetative state.

1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:10.360
 Like, I really can't, like after five,

1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:11.200
 I tell my students,

1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:13.120
 if you want to tell me anything complicated,

1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:14.360
 you're wasting your time.

1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:16.360
 My brain just doesn't function.

1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:17.900
 So even though I only sleep at night,

1:29:17.900 --> 1:29:21.160
 but I'm really starting to shut off, ramp down,

1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:23.120
 really, I mean, it's, you know,

1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:26.160
 I could send the email, talk about brainless stuff,

1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:30.560
 but my power, my energy to do powerful stuff

1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:32.280
 really dropped tremendously.

1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:34.320
 So all my students who know me very well,

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:36.960
 they put the meetings with me early in the morning,

1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:38.600
 because they know this is when I'm,

1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:41.600
 so everything for me, and for me, it's very tight.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.040
 So it could be different for,

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:45.960
 it's very clustered in the morning, it's all tied together,

1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:48.880
 and literally the remaining part seems to be just a,

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:50.240
 you know, vegetative state.

1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:54.640
 Yeah, you and my bulldog Costello,

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:56.400
 who unfortunately passed away recently,

1:29:56.400 --> 1:29:57.240
 had that in, yeah.

1:29:57.240 --> 1:29:58.120
 Oh no, I did not, that's so sad.

1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.540
 Sam and Costello were good friends.

1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:01.540
 Yeah, sorry to break it to you here.

1:30:01.540 --> 1:30:04.420
 Yeah, he had a good long life and he went easy,

1:30:04.420 --> 1:30:06.220
 but he had a circadian clock

1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:09.720
 that basically would just sleep around 24 hours a day.

1:30:09.720 --> 1:30:12.840
 Minimal activity interspersed every third day or so.

1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:16.160
 You do have this morning vigor,

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:18.800
 and that's, I think other people are going to have

1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:19.860
 more of an afternoon vigor.

1:30:19.860 --> 1:30:23.020
 Do you think that this can change across the lifespan?

1:30:23.020 --> 1:30:27.220
 It's, the rumor is that teenagers naturally want

1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:29.400
 to sleep in later and stay up later.

1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:30.800
 Do you think that social rhythm,

1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:32.480
 or do you think that that's actually biological?

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:33.840
 Yeah, that's a tough question.

1:30:33.840 --> 1:30:37.400
 I mean, it could be both.

1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:40.640
 One thing that worries me is that it seems that

1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:44.760
 if anything with age, this morning rigor gets stronger.

1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.600
 You mean you want people to become more of morning?

1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:47.440
 More of morning.

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:48.260
 But why is that worry you?

1:30:48.260 --> 1:30:49.100
 I think that's good.

1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:51.720
 Because for me, I'm already a very shifted morning.

1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:53.720
 I don't want to be one of these 7 p.m.

1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:55.800
 to 1 a.m. sleepers at some point.

1:30:55.800 --> 1:30:57.600
 Yeah, on the other hand, it's also kind of nice

1:30:57.600 --> 1:30:59.440
 because it's quiet and you can get work done.

1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:03.660
 But honestly, from 4.30 to 7.30, when my wife wake up,

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.800
 it can be very lonely.

1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:08.920
 Yes, you achieve a lot, but it's quiet outside.

1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:12.120
 It's, you know, so I don't want to be at 1 a.m.

1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:12.960
 Let's put it this way.

1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:13.800
 I don't want to.

1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:15.560
 You can tell Samra is more social than I am.

1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:16.380
 That's right.

1:31:16.380 --> 1:31:17.220
 That is true.

1:31:17.220 --> 1:31:18.580
 But we should touch on that actually.

1:31:18.580 --> 1:31:22.080
 So your wife is, she follows a different schedule.

1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:22.920
 Yeah.

1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:26.320
 And so the social rhythm is important.

1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:27.840
 I think, what should we do?

1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:29.740
 How should we conceptualize

1:31:29.740 --> 1:31:31.680
 and how should we adjust ourselves

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:32.520
 according to the social rhythm?

1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:35.360
 And I honestly love this hypothesis

1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:39.320
 that people came up with and Pat's kids reminded me of.

1:31:39.320 --> 1:31:42.880
 Because kids are really gonna disrupt your sleep-wake cycle,

1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:46.640
 it seems like there is a chrono attraction

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:48.980
 that usually people who attract each others

1:31:48.980 --> 1:31:51.840
 have actually different sleep-wake schedule.

1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:54.200
 And the idea being is that this allows them

1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:57.520
 to take care of their kids throughout the day-night cycle.

1:31:57.520 --> 1:31:58.720
 And have a peaceful marriage.

1:31:58.720 --> 1:32:01.200
 And have a peaceful marriage in a way, right?

1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:03.440
 So, I mean, we didn't have kids me and Rachel,

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:06.520
 so maybe this is, but it seems like evolutionary,

1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:09.920
 it makes sense that if you want to protect your kids,

1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:12.040
 you don't want everybody to be mourning rigor

1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:13.640
 and then the kids don't have,

1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:15.880
 so you want the distributed across.

1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:16.700
 It makes sense.

1:32:16.700 --> 1:32:17.840
 It's a reasonable argument.

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:20.160
 I've heard that one of the reasons

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:24.640
 that people think that the clock is not exactly 24 hours,

1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:28.400
 but is 24 hours plus or minus 20 minutes or so

1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:33.400
 is because we believe that we evolved in clans or groups,

1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:37.040
 villages, whatever, that we're about 100 to 200 people.

1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:40.240
 And in order to have protection around

1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:43.900
 the early morning hours when we're vulnerable to predation,

1:32:43.900 --> 1:32:46.160
 and in the late night hours that you would want

1:32:46.160 --> 1:32:49.080
 some individuals of our species to be naturally

1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:51.260
 more like night owls and some more like early people.

1:32:51.260 --> 1:32:55.920
 So your theory of parenting is similar in that way.

1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:56.760
 Right.

1:32:56.760 --> 1:32:59.160
 The social rhythm is a powerful rhythm though.

1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:02.600
 Meaning if I go out and I'm tired,

1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:04.880
 let's say I'm tired at like 9.30, I don't want to go out,

1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:05.720
 like I'm gonna need it.

1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:06.840
 So can I just say something about that?

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:11.380
 I think the social rhythm is powerful at the obvious levels,

1:33:11.380 --> 1:33:13.240
 like it affects your sleep,

1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:15.860
 it affects how much you wake up or eat,

1:33:15.860 --> 1:33:17.720
 but I'm not so sure it's as powerful

1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:19.760
 as people think on the clock.

1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:21.760
 Now, eventually it will mess up the clock

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:24.720
 because now if you're doing a lot of social at night,

1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:27.000
 getting enough light, eating at the wrong time of the day,

1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:29.760
 eventually you're gonna have an effect.

1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:33.840
 But I don't think that's the social interactions themselves

1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:36.280
 have been shown to affect your clock very strongly

1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:37.400
 for some reason.

1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:38.580
 That's good to know.

1:33:38.580 --> 1:33:40.560
 Well, for people hearing this,

1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:42.220
 they're probably getting the impression,

1:33:42.220 --> 1:33:45.340
 like I'm the night owl and then Samir is the one

1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:48.860
 that's in bed at nine and then, you know, wakes up at four,

1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:51.300
 but having attended many meetings with Samir,

1:33:51.300 --> 1:33:53.480
 I can tell you that he's the party animal.

1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:55.960
 So let's talk about that.

1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:58.640
 I mean, let's talk about the fact that you're the partier

1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:01.800
 who's up until two dancing at these various meetings,

1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:05.620
 which I've seen, actually a good dancer I'm told,

1:34:05.620 --> 1:34:10.620
 but what should we do when we do stay up very late

1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:11.880
 for whatever reason?

1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:13.740
 Could be because we had to take a midnight trip

1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:15.640
 to the hospital, unfortunate reason,

1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:18.360
 or it could be because you're in the presence of people

1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:19.640
 that you don't see very often,

1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:22.940
 and you go out for a really nice night out on the town

1:34:22.940 --> 1:34:26.180
 and you get to sleep around 2.30 or three in the morning.

1:34:27.180 --> 1:34:29.120
 How should one get back on schedule?

1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:31.320
 Do you force yourself to then get up and view light

1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:33.440
 at the normal time that you would get up and view light,

1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:35.000
 or do you allow yourself to sleep in?

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.280
 What's the optimal protocol?

1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:37.800
 I would allow myself to sleep in,

1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:39.980
 and remember, this is a long-term effect.

1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:42.600
 This is something that you live with for a long period.

1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:45.200
 And remember, I told you about the experiments

1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:46.240
 we did with the mood.

1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:48.920
 These require two weeks of that light schedule

1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:50.520
 to cause mood disturbances.

1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:52.740
 So these don't happen just in a single day.

1:34:52.740 --> 1:34:55.080
 So this is the way you justify staying out late

1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:55.900
 every once in a while?

1:34:55.900 --> 1:34:58.040
 Well, in the meetings you've seen me,

1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:00.600
 and I've done this for five or six days continuously,

1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:03.400
 but what you didn't see that when I came back to my home,

1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:05.920
 it took me two weeks, as if I did a jet lag.

1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:08.240
 So I really do suffer for two weeks

1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:12.120
 after doing a six crazy night of staying up at night,

1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:14.000
 drinking at the wrong time of the day.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.880
 So it's not that I'm completely okay with it.

1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:18.520
 When I go back, everything goes back.

1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:21.340
 It takes me actually literally two weeks to recover

1:35:21.340 --> 1:35:23.200
 from the circadian rhythm meeting

1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:25.840
 that you've seen me partying at at some point.

1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:28.400
 Which is kind of ironic, the circadian rhythm meeting.

1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:30.560
 People are totally disrupting the circadian cycle,

1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:32.640
 but scientists are human beings too.

1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:37.640
 Right, so I think if you do it at very little occasions,

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:40.960
 I think you should not worry too much

1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:42.800
 that this will have a lasting impact.

1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:45.940
 And the good news is that if you readjust your schedule,

1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:47.160
 you could come back to it.

1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:50.280
 The problem is when you maintain these wrong schedule

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:53.120
 for a prolonged team, it becomes chronic,

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:54.240
 prolonged periods of time.

1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:55.960
 That's when you have the problems

1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:58.120
 and the accumulation of the problems.

1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:00.320
 So when you have sleeping problem,

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:01.720
 you produce metabolic problem.

1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:02.980
 When you have metabolic problems,

1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:04.820
 you produce lack of exercise,

1:36:04.820 --> 1:36:08.340
 and you could see how things can spiral out very quickly,

1:36:08.340 --> 1:36:11.040
 and then it would be hard to come back to it.

1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:13.960
 Well, certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of

1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:18.960
 and a cause of almost all mental health disorders, right?

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:22.040
 And certainly the metabolic syndromes

1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:25.080
 that people are talking about nowadays and all of this,

1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:28.040
 it all funnels back to light.

1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:30.040
 This is what's so remarkable.

1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:31.720
 And so we have these devices,

1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:35.160
 and I use my phone and I use my computer,

1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:38.480
 but do you think that the mere dimming of the screen

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:42.080
 or not interacting with screens after,

1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:45.760
 with say 90 minutes or two hours before bedtime,

1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:47.560
 according to what we're saying today,

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:52.120
 this should have a profound effect on all these factors.

1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:53.520
 And I really believe it does.

1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:58.520
 And I, again, I think as Pat has did these inventions

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:02.880
 where you get a pouch where you put your phone in a pouch.

1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:06.120
 So what Samra's referring to is our friend, Pat,

1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:08.840
 this former SEAL team member that we,

1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:10.620
 who's also a very impressive person

1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:12.760
 in the landscape of business and family, et cetera,

1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:15.940
 a real superhuman from, by any regard,

1:37:17.220 --> 1:37:19.000
 has this habit of taking his phone

1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.600
 and putting it into a sealed pouch in the evening.

1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:22.560
 So it's basically-

1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:26.200
 And in his program, he sends you actually these seal,

1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:27.040
 you know, patches.

1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:30.280
 And so that I think is a great idea

1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:33.400
 because not only it will take away the light from you,

1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:35.200
 but it also take away the distraction

1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:39.860
 because you wanna repair and recover and sleep does that.

1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:42.280
 And if you have your phone dinging all the time

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.000
 or the light flashing from it,

1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:46.640
 you're just not getting enough sleep

1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:49.100
 and you're causing yourself major problems.

1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:51.960
 I never asked you this,

1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:56.960
 but I realize now that I should have long ago,

1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:58.200
 but I'll ask you now,

1:37:59.100 --> 1:38:02.360
 why and how did you get into all this stuff?

1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:05.100
 Yeah, I mean, honestly, I, first of all,

1:38:05.100 --> 1:38:07.160
 I wanted to become a, you know,

1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:08.660
 I wanted to study genetics

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:11.860
 and I knew I wanted to do PhD in genetics,

1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:14.520
 but I only got accepted in one university at the time

1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:16.860
 and I joined the learning and memory lab.

1:38:16.860 --> 1:38:18.120
 And I liked learning and memory.

1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:19.840
 At the beginning, I worked in the snails

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:21.280
 on a plesia californica

1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:23.200
 and started looking at learning and memory,

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:26.720
 but then the same lab was looking at these daily variation.

1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:28.440
 I was really struck.

1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:31.040
 Like you never think about it outside of science.

1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:36.040
 It really struck me that organisms can measure day,

1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:39.120
 biologically, that was very shocking to me.

1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:41.160
 And I just really got attracted

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:44.540
 and I wanted to see why does this happen?

1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:46.400
 What is the effect of different times of day?

1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:47.720
 And I just stuck with it.

1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:50.140
 It's just, it was mind blowing for me,

1:38:50.140 --> 1:38:52.000
 who was in medical school

1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.380
 that I've never heard about it before.

1:38:54.380 --> 1:38:56.200
 You know, it's really amazing medicine.

1:38:56.200 --> 1:38:58.960
 I think still now we are very good

1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:01.160
 at looking at stuff spatially,

1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:04.640
 but we're very bad at looking at temporal aspects.

1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:06.920
 So we always, you know, like to see images,

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:09.520
 static images, spatial information.

1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:11.280
 Take an X-ray, measure a temperature,

1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:12.120
 measure a blood pressure.

1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:14.880
 Exactly, but we don't think of temporal.

1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:17.480
 And you know, you talk to John Huganash right now

1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:20.480
 and he's telling you the importance of chronomedicine

1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:24.040
 or chrono pharma, pharma two, whatever the word is.

1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:27.680
 And it just, it really just getting the drugs

1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:29.000
 at the right time of the day

1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.480
 is gonna be essential for our health.

1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:33.960
 Do you think that's gonna come from using better trackers

1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:37.320
 like aura rings, whoop straps, these kinds of things?

1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:38.400
 I love the trackers,

1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:40.840
 but I think there's even more exciting discoveries.

1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.920
 Now you could take a single blood sample

1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:45.600
 and measure many biological components

1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:48.160
 and figure where you are in the circadian clock,

1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:50.640
 something that was very hard to do before.

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.480
 So if you have a marker to know where you are in the clock,

1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:56.080
 you could actually understand more the effect

1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:58.760
 of everything, exercise, feeding, light input.

1:39:58.760 --> 1:39:59.960
 What is the marker?

1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:03.440
 So there are some papers from, what's her name,

1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:06.960
 Phyllis Zee and from Haim Kramer,

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:08.840
 where they measure multiple RNAs

1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:11.840
 that are known to tell you what phase of the clock is

1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.640
 or multiple proteins or biological reactions.

1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:19.160
 And depending on a combination of factor,

1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:20.120
 not a single factor,

1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:23.360
 you could tell where you are in the circadian clock.

1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:25.880
 So they could, instead of just measuring temperature

1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:27.840
 or melatonin, just one measurement.

1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:29.880
 And melatonin specifically is also complicated

1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:32.760
 by the fact that melatonin is affected by light.

1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:36.120
 And temperature, your temperature and sleep

1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:38.280
 can be easily dissociatable, right?

1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:40.320
 When you travel across different times on your sleep

1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:43.280
 at different times in the temperature cycle.

1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:46.000
 So having multiple components measured

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:49.760
 will give you a better determination of your circadian phase

1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:53.200
 and understanding your circadian phase in humans

1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:54.680
 will tell you what is the effect

1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:56.000
 of giving certain drugs

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.680
 at certain times of the circadian phase.

1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:00.280
 So in the future, this is gonna be studied

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.600
 at a much higher level when you can determine the phase

1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.480
 in relation to all the other stuff.

1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:12.000
 It's striking to me that in all animals, besides humans,

1:41:12.040 --> 1:41:15.280
 if they deviate too much from the appropriate exposure

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:16.840
 to light and light-dark cycle,

1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:20.480
 they essentially don't mate and or die

1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:22.320
 and or get killed off.

1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:25.080
 But in humans, we are able to override that

1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:26.600
 at least to some extent.

1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:31.360
 But the ways in which we suffer appear to be things like

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.240
 obesity, metabolic syndromes, reproductive syndromes

1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:38.360
 that accompany the other syndromes, endocrine syndromes

1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:41.240
 and mood and depressive disorders.

1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:45.600
 Is there any effort at the level of the nationally

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:47.600
 or laboratories that you're aware of

1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.360
 to try and use light in order to improve mood

1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:52.400
 and mental health?

1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:54.520
 I mean, honestly, this is my mantra.

1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:57.200
 This is the thing that I think people,

1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:01.360
 because I say, don't take a pill, take a photon.

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.000
 I mean, you take pills, it's important.

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.240
 I'm just making it that really,

1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.440
 we have an opportunity right now

1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:10.440
 with the incredible advances of LED lights,

1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:15.440
 of changing spectrum of light, of regulating intensities.

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:19.000
 And just for simple changes,

1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.880
 you could really improve sleep-wake cycle, productivity,

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:25.520
 and still you could actually get more done

1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:27.480
 because as we've talked about,

1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:29.520
 when you have all these messed up,

1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:32.880
 now you have to sleep more, but your sleep is fragmented.

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:34.040
 It's not very good.

1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:34.880
 And you can't focus when you use it.

1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:37.440
 And you can't focus when you don't have alertness

1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:39.280
 when you need the alertness.

1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:43.160
 So having all these could allow you to do even more

1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:45.200
 actually at the end than less.

1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:47.920
 And that's the exciting part of it.

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:50.400
 One of the questions I get asked most often about

1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:52.200
 is about ADHD.

1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:54.120
 I think there's a lot of self-prescribed

1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:56.200
 as well as clinically prescribed ADHD.

1:42:56.200 --> 1:42:58.880
 People are having a tremendously difficult time focusing

1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:00.560
 and not just because they're sleepy,

1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:02.240
 they just can't seem to anchor their attention.

1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:04.160
 And there could be multiple reasons for this,

1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:06.800
 but there are now several clinical trials ongoing

1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:09.880
 using light to try and anchor people's attention

1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:12.000
 and mood and wellbeing for sake of focus.

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.480
 And I think that while I love this saying

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:17.640
 that you mentioned, take a photon, not a pill,

1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:21.480
 and with due respect to the need for pharmacology

1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:24.600
 for certain people, I think most people

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:27.160
 just haven't really dialed in their relationship to light

1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:28.680
 in a way that allows them to rule out

1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:30.560
 whether or not they need medication.

1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:31.400
 Absolutely.

1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:32.640
 That's the best way to put it.

1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:33.840
 I can't add to that.

1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:39.480
 Let's talk about jet lag, but not in the context of,

1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:42.640
 okay, if somebody's traveling from Europe to Japan

1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:44.840
 or from the East Coast, because that varies tremendously,

1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:45.680
 right?

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:47.000
 I mean, there's as many different variations

1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.640
 on travel as there are individuals out there

1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:52.440
 and with goals and jobs, et cetera,

1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:55.840
 but rather let's talk about what are the two or three things

1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:59.400
 that people can do to adjust their schedule quickly.

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:01.720
 Yesterday, I called you and said, look,

1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:04.040
 I know somebody who's traveling six hours.

1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:05.440
 I won't even mention in which direction

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:08.120
 because I don't want people to anchor to that example.

1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:13.120
 And you described some very simple tools of viewing light

1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:15.760
 a little bit earlier than normal

1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:18.560
 and getting on the local food schedule, et cetera,

1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:20.720
 that would allow them to shift more quickly.

1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:22.920
 And the reason I want to have this conversation is yes,

1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:25.800
 for the travelers and for the shift workers,

1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:30.160
 but mostly because of the fact that you've proven

1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:33.600
 again and again that people are disrupted

1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:36.280
 in their circadian behavior at home.

1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:39.000
 So what are the, aside from what we've already talked about,

1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:42.320
 how can one adjust quickly to a new schedule?

1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:44.080
 Like let's say fall classes are starting,

1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.320
 you start a new job or you have a baby or a puppy

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:48.480
 or whatever, what is the best way

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:50.200
 to shift the clock quickly?

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.600
 So it's very simple as we've talked yesterday.

1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:57.600
 So imagine you're in the outside with no industrial light.

1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:02.080
 If your body thinks you're in early evening

1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:04.960
 and you see a bright light, what does this tell you?

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:07.600
 Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet.

1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:11.160
 It's still early afternoon or late afternoon.

1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:14.880
 So I have to delay my clock to go back to late afternoon.

1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:18.120
 So if you get light early in the evening,

1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:20.040
 it delays your clock.

1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:20.880
 So what does-

1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:22.840
 Meaning that makes you want to go to sleep later.

1:45:22.840 --> 1:45:24.000
 Yes, it delays your clock.

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:27.760
 So you're in New York, right?

1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:29.760
 People in Italy have an advanced clock

1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:33.000
 because they are six hours ahead of us.

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.800
 So if you're in New York and you get light early

1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:39.440
 in the evening, you delay even further from Italy.

1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:42.080
 So now you're delaying away from Italy.

1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:43.600
 Now, the same thing happens.

1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:45.720
 Let's say you thought dawn came up

1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:47.720
 and you thought it's already dawn,

1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:49.800
 but it was, let's say, three o'clock in the morning

1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:50.840
 or four o'clock in the morning.

1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:52.720
 And then you get a bright light and you say,

1:45:52.720 --> 1:45:55.800
 oh, wait a minute, dawn is not up yet.

1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:57.400
 So I should advance my clock.

1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:01.400
 Or I'm at night, but I'm getting bright light

1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:04.640
 so I should run because dawn is already up.

1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:09.240
 So then later in the night, later in your night,

1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:11.920
 and actually it just happens that the humans,

1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:14.800
 you get a temperature in the day or later in the night,

1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:16.520
 low temperature in your body.

1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.040
 After that, light start advancing your clock.

1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:21.560
 So if you want to go to Italy,

1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:23.440
 instead of getting light early in the evening,

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:26.680
 you want to get light after the temperature low.

1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:30.040
 So you could advance your clock even before you go to Italy

1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:32.920
 and you're catching up to the Italians just by using light.

1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:34.360
 It's as simple as that.

1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:36.680
 So you could do it for every region.

1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:39.960
 You could calculate how much they are advanced of you.

1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:43.000
 You could know how much these light shifts happen per day,

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.920
 and you can calculate what you need to do,

1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:49.880
 very simple math, to adjust either in direction of delaying,

1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:51.720
 if you're going from New York to California,

1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:53.360
 you want to delay your clock,

1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:56.280
 or advancing if you're going from New York to Italy.

1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.560
 So in order to make that a visual,

1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:00.200
 and because a lot of people are listening to this,

1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:01.800
 not looking at it on video,

1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:06.800
 we will put a zero-cost downloadable figure of this

1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:10.280
 on the Hubermanlab.com website related to this episode.

1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:14.440
 But I think I can summarize it in language as well.

1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:17.520
 If I understand correctly, what you're saying is,

1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:21.160
 if your typical wake-up time is, say, 7 a.m.,

1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:23.000
 then your low point in temperature

1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.280
 probably occurs somewhere around 5 a.m.

1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:29.360
 And if you view light right around then,

1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:31.720
 it's going to essentially advance your clock.

1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:33.720
 Because then your body thinks,

1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:35.640
 oh, it's 7 o'clock, so it'll advance your clock

1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:37.000
 by one to two hours.

1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.760
 But if I were to view light, say, at 3 a.m.,

1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:42.680
 then it would probably delay my clock.

1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:43.880
 Yeah. Okay.

1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:47.160
 Yeah, so, and then let's say I land in a new schedule.

1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:48.320
 I want to adjust to a new schedule.

1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:50.000
 Let's say I didn't manage to do anything

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:51.440
 with my light viewing before I went,

1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:53.480
 and I didn't anticipate the trip.

1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:56.200
 Suddenly, I'm on a new schedule, okay?

1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:59.760
 I was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock

1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:02.080
 and to avoid gastrointestinal issues

1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:05.240
 is to eat on the local schedule,

1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:08.240
 to start basically behaving like a local,

1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:10.400
 even though your circadian clock

1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:11.960
 will take a little bit of time to catch up.

1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:12.800
 Absolutely.

1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:15.360
 But you have to remember the light, right?

1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:17.960
 So let's, now that we explained it very simply,

1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:20.800
 let's take a very simple example, right?

1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:22.160
 New York to Italy.

1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:23.840
 That's a simple example.

1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:26.800
 New York time, Italy time, six-hour difference, right?

1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:29.640
 So let's say you fly from New York at night.

1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:31.840
 You reach Italy at eight o'clock in the morning.

1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:34.800
 What is the time in your New York time?

1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:35.640
 Although you reach-

1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:36.480
 Six hours back.

1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:37.320
 Six hours back.

1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:38.480
 It's two a.m.

1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:39.800
 So when you land Italy,

1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:42.160
 you want to avoid light like the plague.

1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:43.200
 Yeah, you could eat,

1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:44.960
 but you really don't want to get a light.

1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:45.800
 Right, because otherwise it's going to delay you.

1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:46.840
 It's going to delay you.

1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:48.320
 It's going to send you to California

1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:49.640
 instead of sending you to Italy.

1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:51.560
 Right, and so this is such a key point.

1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:52.920
 If anyone's confused about this,

1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:54.240
 we will put some diagrams up,

1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:57.720
 but what Samir's saying is so crucial.

1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:00.120
 Just because getting bright light in your eyes

1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:02.440
 early in the day is really beneficial when you're at home.

1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:04.920
 When you travel to a new time zone,

1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:09.480
 you have to take into account what your body thinks,

1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:10.520
 what, excuse me,

1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:11.960
 you have to take into account

1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:13.480
 where your body thinks you are.

1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:15.520
 And so if you're looking at the Italian sunrise,

1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:17.880
 having just flown from New York to Italy,

1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:19.400
 and you didn't prepare for that trip

1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:21.600
 by waking up a little bit earlier in anticipation.

1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:22.440
 Multiple days, yeah.

1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:24.640
 And you view light at two a, excuse me,

1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:27.560
 at six or seven a.m. Italian time.

1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:29.360
 Beautiful Italian sunrise.

1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:31.040
 You are going to delay your clock.

1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:33.920
 You're going to basically throw yourself back to California,

1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:35.200
 but you are in Italy.

1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:37.240
 You're going to throw your biology back to California

1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:38.320
 and you are going to be up

1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:40.000
 in the middle of the Italian night

1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.400
 and you're going to be miserable.

1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:44.120
 I'll tell a brief anecdote

1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:47.560
 because I called Samir in desperation a few years ago.

1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:50.760
 I traveled to Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi to give a seminar.

1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:53.040
 12 hours out of phase, it's a 12 hour flip.

1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:55.160
 And I thought I could just muscle it.

1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:56.000
 I thought I'll get up,

1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.320
 I'll just view sunlight when the sun comes up.

1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:02.040
 And I fell apart mentally and physically.

1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:04.280
 And Samir came to my rescue.

1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:05.120
 I called him.

1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:06.040
 I said, I don't know what to do.

1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:08.720
 And he said, go to the gym,

1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:12.560
 went at the local dawn,

1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:14.920
 work out, eat,

1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:18.320
 and then view sunlight starting the next day.

1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:19.880
 And that basically got me onto schedule.

1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:22.160
 So I used food and exercise to adjust myself

1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:24.040
 because my light viewing activity

1:50:24.040 --> 1:50:25.520
 was just completely out of whack.

1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:28.080
 Yeah, I mean, and we talked about other details.

1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:29.640
 So you have to calculate it,

1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:31.040
 but you're absolutely right.

1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:34.120
 I mean, it's very important

1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:36.760
 to avoid getting the wrong light information

1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:38.360
 when you're trying to adjust your body

1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:41.800
 because otherwise it shifts you to the other side.

1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:43.200
 Absolutely right.

1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:47.400
 Well, you are one of these people that has such vigor.

1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:48.280
 It's one of these things

1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:50.200
 where having known you all these years,

1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:52.720
 you have a tremendous capacity for work

1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:57.000
 and for soccer and for arguing, respectful arguing.

1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:58.520
 And, you know, sometimes, you know-

1:50:58.520 --> 1:50:59.880
 It's getting worse with age.

1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:01.800
 Yeah, well, we could talk about that offline,

1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:04.400
 but I think a lot of your vigor

1:51:04.400 --> 1:51:06.840
 and a lot of your ability to work hard and focus

1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:10.160
 and really do so many things at an impressive level

1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:11.800
 is because you think about these issues

1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:13.840
 and you think about when you're going

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:15.560
 to be optimal for focus,

1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:17.440
 when you're going to be optimal for exercise,

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:20.440
 when, and the when is the key.

1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:22.440
 And I think a lot of people live in the landscape

1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:25.120
 of feeling like there's something broken inside them

1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:26.520
 because they can't focus.

1:51:26.520 --> 1:51:27.880
 It's subconscious, right?

1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:30.840
 Remember, it's all subconscious, these effects.

1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:32.120
 And you're absolutely right.

1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:35.200
 Now, honestly, joking aside about age,

1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:37.960
 I really agree with you that I think part of the reason

1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:40.000
 I'm continuing to be able to do this,

1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.120
 that I really think about it

1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:45.360
 and I make sure that I keep everything aligned.

1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:47.600
 And that actually helps me a lot.

1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:49.920
 Like I don't suffer in sleep.

1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:51.120
 I don't suffer in waking up.

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:53.560
 I never use a timer to wake up.

1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:55.160
 I mean, people say, aren't you scared?

1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:57.920
 Like you have to give a lecture at eight or 7.30.

1:51:57.920 --> 1:51:58.760
 Honestly, I was like,

1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:01.080
 there is no way I'm going to go beyond that.

1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:02.480
 It just, even if I try,

1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:05.680
 I can't sleep beyond 6 a.m. in my regular times.

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:07.400
 It's just, it's not going to happen.

1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:10.720
 By 4.30, my eyes are wide awake and I'm in bed.

1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:14.560
 It's just, system is so aligned, it works.

1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:17.160
 A lot of times people will say,

1:52:17.160 --> 1:52:18.320
 how come I go to sleep?

1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:19.400
 I fall asleep fine,

1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:21.160
 but then I wake up at three or four in the morning

1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:22.720
 and can't fall back asleep.

1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:24.200
 Is it possible that those people

1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:26.320
 were supposed to go to bed at 8 p.m.?

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:27.200
 It's possible.

1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:28.760
 I mean, it is possible.

1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:31.560
 It is also possible that sometimes people will wake up

1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:32.720
 and go back to sleep.

1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:35.480
 But yeah, I mean, it is possible,

1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:38.560
 or it's possible that their clock is completely misaligned,

1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:41.520
 that they are getting maybe a nap time at night

1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:42.360
 when they are supposed,

1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:44.400
 and then they possibly feel so sleepy in the day.

1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:46.880
 So all these are possible combinations.

1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:48.600
 Well, that's an interesting idea and considered.

1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:50.680
 So what they think is their sleep,

1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:53.520
 their body is so out of whack with the light dark cycle

1:52:53.520 --> 1:52:55.160
 that it's actually a nap.

1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:57.080
 Or the weaker part of the sleep.

1:52:57.080 --> 1:52:59.760
 I mean, you see this when you travel

1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:02.240
 to different time zones before you adjust.

1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:03.920
 You go to sleep really well,

1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:06.360
 but two hours later you're fully up.

1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:07.320
 Two hours.

1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:09.840
 If you were so tired and this is your regular sleep,

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:13.280
 there's no way you're gonna wake up in two hours.

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:16.360
 So then you feel very sleepy later in the day

1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:17.280
 or something like that.

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:20.120
 So it depends on how your whole system

1:53:20.120 --> 1:53:21.560
 is aligned to the environment.

1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:23.080
 That's a very interesting idea.

1:53:23.080 --> 1:53:26.880
 I think that's gonna resonate with a lot of people.

1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:30.560
 I wake up every morning around three or four.

1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:32.440
 I generally use the bathroom

1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:34.720
 and then I fall back asleep very deeply.

1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:37.360
 Doesn't seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness.

1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:40.360
 And I think a lot of people obsess over that waking up

1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:41.760
 and worry there's something wrong.

1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:43.800
 Provided they can go back to sleep, it's okay.

1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:46.560
 If you can't go use the bathroom, go back to sleep,

1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:48.120
 that should not be a problem.

1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:50.280
 Maybe some people when they go to use the bathroom,

1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:51.560
 they use very bright light

1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:53.680
 and then they get an alerting signal.

1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:57.120
 So if you, maybe that could be as simple as that,

1:53:57.120 --> 1:53:57.960
 that affects you.

1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:00.400
 Maybe when you wake up, you put tons of light

1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:02.440
 or you start reading your iPad.

1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:04.120
 So there's all these combination

1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:05.680
 that we still don't know about

1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:08.040
 that could be affecting their sleep wake rhythms

1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:10.360
 and their sleep maintenance.

1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:13.440
 Do you use melatonin or do you take melatonin?

1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:14.680
 I don't need it to be honest.

1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:16.880
 In my case, there is no reason to use it

1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:20.840
 because I could guarantee you that by maybe eight o'clock,

1:54:20.840 --> 1:54:23.080
 my melatonin has already started to go up.

1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:25.600
 And by the time I sleep, my melatonin is very high

1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:29.120
 because I don't use a lot of lights after sunset.

1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:30.640
 And light inhibits melatonin.

1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:33.480
 And life really blocks melatonin level.

1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:36.440
 You hear this myth that the pineal gland

1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:38.280
 calcifies as we get older.

1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.640
 Is that, do you know anything about that?

1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:42.400
 I mean, I've heard about that, but I don't know what does,

1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:44.280
 I mean, there is not very clear evidence

1:54:44.280 --> 1:54:45.440
 that affects the sleep.

1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:47.480
 I don't know much about it, to be honest.

1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:49.080
 The evidence that I've seen is that yes,

1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:51.240
 there's some calcification around the pineal,

1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:53.800
 just because of where it sits in the brain.

1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:57.720
 It's close to some bony structures,

1:54:57.720 --> 1:54:59.480
 but I don't think there's any evidence

1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:01.600
 that it has negative effects.

1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:04.560
 I mean, if you still have, you could measure melatonin

1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:06.040
 and that should tell you if it has any,

1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:08.040
 it's such an easy thing to do.

1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:11.080
 I think this is more of a internet wellness thing

1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:14.360
 that got outside the cage.

1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:15.440
 I think you're absolutely right.

1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:18.040
 Yeah, it sounds terrible calcification

1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:20.120
 of the thing, right?

1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:21.240
 The hard thing, right?

1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:22.360
 Yeah, exactly.

1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:26.080
 Let's talk about seasonality a little bit.

1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.240
 I learned, and I don't know if this is still true,

1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.160
 but that most suicides occur in April, in the spring.

1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:38.800
 I think there's a poem that says,

1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.160
 April is the cruelest month, I think is the poem begins.

1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:47.160
 Are there data that suicides are more frequent

1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:48.560
 at particular times of year?

1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:50.760
 And if so, is the spring that time of year?

1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:53.000
 Yeah, I mean, a lot of people talk about this.

1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.960
 And one of the hypothesis is that the winter months

1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:59.520
 that are very bad for mood

1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:01.960
 make people not wanting to do anything.

1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:05.480
 And they get into such deep level of depression

1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.040
 that when the sun comes up,

1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:09.920
 they get actually the energy to act on their depression,

1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:12.720
 which sounds really terrible, and it is terrible.

1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:13.760
 It's terrible.

1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:16.000
 So that's the idea that the lack of light

1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.040
 throughout the winter caused them to go into such depression

1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:21.640
 that they don't feel like doing anything.

1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:25.000
 And when the light comes in with rigor in the spring,

1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.360
 it gives them that,

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.160
 after all the depression they suffered,

1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:33.160
 gives them that push to take that sad final act, I guess.

1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:36.920
 What other seasonal effects have been demonstrated

1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:37.760
 in humans?

1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:39.280
 Yeah, I mean, I think in humans,

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:42.440
 it's not very clear because we don't think about seasonality.

1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:45.400
 But if you start thinking about us,

1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:47.960
 I think we go through major seasonal changes.

1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:48.800
 I really do.

1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:51.680
 I think our eating pattern change across the year,

1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:54.520
 I could tell you that me thinking about this,

1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:58.440
 there's a clear changes that happens to me across the year.

1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:00.800
 But for animals, this is really essential.

1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:05.280
 Because for animals, they have to time their mating behavior

1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:07.920
 was when they deliver their progeny

1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:10.680
 in the most abundant amount of food.

1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:13.920
 And artificial light is causing major disruption

1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:16.560
 because if you change the way these animals

1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.920
 are receiving the light information,

1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:22.040
 they either start mating much earlier or much later,

1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:23.560
 and their numbers dwindle,

1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:25.800
 and they get into the dangers

1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:28.960
 of really completely getting eliminated or extinct.

1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:31.400
 Well, human birth rates are definitely going down.

1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:33.880
 I mean, in the U.S. in particular.

1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:35.320
 Some areas, not others.

1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:36.440
 Not others, right.

1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:41.360
 But are there other effects of seasonality on humans

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:42.840
 that we are aware of?

1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:44.400
 Honestly, like you could see it,

1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:46.840
 honestly, you could see it perfectly, I think,

1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:48.280
 in Scandinavia.

1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:51.280
 I mean, you could talk to people who live in.

1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:53.080
 Sure, they get seasonal depression.

1:57:53.080 --> 1:57:54.600
 Well, seasonal depression is one,

1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:57.000
 but actually when you start asking them questions,

1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:58.600
 they tell you like in the winter,

1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.600
 they barely could wake up,

1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:03.520
 they barely have the energy before even depression.

1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:05.960
 Even people who don't get seasonal depression,

1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:08.080
 they'll tell you our energy level is lower,

1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:11.280
 our ability to go to work is not the same.

1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:15.000
 And in the summer, most people actually sleep very little.

1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.560
 They tell you we really can,

1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:21.280
 we feel like we're manic, we have all this energy,

1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:23.720
 and not in a negative way, in a funny way, right?

1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:25.240
 I mean, but if you wanna sleep,

1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:27.120
 we have to put this curtain.

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.160
 I think in these situations,

1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:32.600
 you could really appreciate the seasonality of humans.

1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:35.600
 I think we kind of destroyed our seasonality

1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:39.760
 because we don't get exposed to that much natural light.

1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:41.440
 We have all this artificial light.

1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:43.280
 But I think, honestly,

1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.360
 one of the things that is gonna happen,

1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:47.320
 if they follow your recommendations

1:58:47.320 --> 1:58:49.640
 about giving light at the same time,

1:58:49.640 --> 1:58:51.080
 giving food, giving exercise.

1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:52.680
 Wait, let's be clear, those are your recommendations.

1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:56.080
 Well, I mean. No, I'm just fair attribution.

1:58:56.080 --> 1:58:58.480
 What I'm saying is that this is gonna cause them

1:58:58.480 --> 1:59:01.680
 to also experience some changes across the season

1:59:01.680 --> 1:59:04.920
 because now, they're gonna see the sun differently.

1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:07.400
 If you're gonna go out in the morning,

1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:09.480
 in the summer, you're gonna get a much brighter,

1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:11.200
 that's why I don't like the change in time.

1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:14.640
 I know people think, oh, because you're biased,

1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:15.480
 because I think.

1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:16.440
 Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:18.160
 The change now, are you talking about daylight savings?

1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:20.480
 Daylight savings, it's such a bad idea

1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:24.160
 because it disrupts that rhythm that you're having.

1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:27.040
 Because I think your body, if you keep that rhythm,

1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:28.800
 you will see the whole seasonality.

1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:32.160
 And I look at it from a different aspect than other people.

1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:34.200
 It really, and people say I'm biased

1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:37.120
 because I'm a morning person, and it may be true.

1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:38.960
 But there's situation.

1:59:38.960 --> 1:59:41.040
 Secret conspiracy about morning people.

1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:43.720
 Yeah, but there is, if you think about it, Andrew,

1:59:43.720 --> 1:59:46.840
 there is a situation where you're getting light

1:59:46.840 --> 1:59:48.480
 perfectly well, and then all of a sudden,

1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:50.640
 they delay it by one hour.

1:59:50.640 --> 1:59:53.040
 And then, even though it's the summer,

1:59:53.040 --> 1:59:55.600
 your body now, if you're still not adjusting,

1:59:55.600 --> 1:59:57.360
 think, oh, wait, what happened?

1:59:57.360 --> 1:59:58.480
 What kind of happened?

1:59:58.480 --> 1:59:59.760
 Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up

1:59:59.760 --> 2:00:03.080
 because I always thought, what's the big deal?

2:00:03.080 --> 2:00:04.200
 One hour, right?

2:00:04.200 --> 2:00:06.400
 One hour shift, spring forward, fall back.

2:00:06.400 --> 2:00:08.000
 It's so hard to adjust to one hour action.

2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:11.680
 But this goes back to the beginning of our discussion.

2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:13.160
 It's not just one hour.

2:00:13.160 --> 2:00:14.000
 Right.

2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.120
 Because it's one hour across that one day,

2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:18.520
 but there's this cumulative effect on the clock

2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:22.920
 and these three elements of your tripartite model.

2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:25.880
 The homeostatic sleep and the direct effects on mood.

2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:29.600
 And when it's so close, it's sometimes hard to figure out

2:00:29.600 --> 2:00:32.160
 how to adjust it perfectly because, you know,

2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:34.600
 we're already sleep deprived in our society.

2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:36.680
 And then you shift it by, you know,

2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:40.720
 so it just, it all accumulates and it has no benefit.

2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:42.800
 Well, you work at a major government organization,

2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:44.200
 National Institute of Mental Health.

2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:46.040
 Why don't we campaign for-

2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:47.560
 Honestly, I have no idea.

2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:48.400
 I mean, it makes no sense.

2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:50.040
 No, I'm saying, why don't we go campaign?

2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:51.000
 Yeah, I would love to.

2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:54.400
 I mean, it makes no sense to have the summer light

2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:56.360
 goes up at 9 p.m.

2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:59.800
 The light goes down where I live in Baltimore at 9 p.m.

2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:03.240
 And then all of a sudden, when you really want to

2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:04.840
 see the light longer in the day,

2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:06.520
 you now shift the other way.

2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:08.360
 And now it goes all of a sudden at 6 p.m.

2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:10.040
 Why do you do these drastic changes?

2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:13.600
 Well, let it blend across the whole season.

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.120
 You know, yes, later, earlier at night,

2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:17.960
 but it's at least consistent.

2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:20.120
 It goes in a very consistent manner.

2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:22.040
 I just don't understand why they do this.

2:01:22.040 --> 2:01:23.360
 It makes no sense.

2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:25.840
 Well, I think that the reason they do it

2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:28.320
 is because they don't understand the biology.

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:30.280
 Because one hour seems trivial,

2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:33.040
 unless you understand the repercussions

2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:34.480
 of that one hour shift.

2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:36.880
 Because what's also clear now,

2:01:36.880 --> 2:01:37.760
 based on what you're saying,

2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:40.080
 is that that one hour shift is taking you

2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:42.680
 out of alignment with the natural light dark cycle

2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:44.840
 in exactly the wrong direction.

2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:48.280
 It's pushing people to get even later in the summer

2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:51.000
 when light is going to push you later anyway.

2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:52.160
 It doesn't make sense.

2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:53.120
 You put it beautifully.

2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.320
 I just rambled and this is new.

2:01:55.320 --> 2:01:56.800
 No, no, you made it clear.

2:01:56.800 --> 2:01:59.400
 I mean, it's like literally it made you,

2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:02.040
 it made people who are having problem

2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:05.200
 having an advanced sleep rhythm because they are delayed.

2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:08.120
 Now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed.

2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:10.840
 You push them even later in the day and night cycle.

2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:13.280
 It just doesn't make sense at all.

2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:16.640
 I think 2022 should be the year

2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:18.960
 that we abolish bad daylight savings.

2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:20.480
 That would be the day for me, honestly.

2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:25.480
 Well, also if it has a positive effect on the,

2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:28.960
 what is essentially an epidemic of mental health issues

2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:30.520
 and other issues related to

2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:33.280
 improper interactions with light,

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:37.200
 that I think is a well worthwhile cause.

2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:38.880
 And we can explore.

2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:41.040
 So for once we're going to fight with some,

2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:43.280
 with another group, a common battle

2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:44.120
 as opposed to with one another.

2:02:44.120 --> 2:02:46.080
 I mean, the circadian people, honestly,

2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.320
 to give them credit have been trying for years

2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:49.960
 to abolish daylight saving.

2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:52.400
 Yeah, the problem is they all go to sleep at 9 p.m.

2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:54.400
 and wake up at 4 a.m. so we never see them.

2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:55.720
 That's right.

2:02:55.720 --> 2:02:59.200
 No, the circadian community has done an amazing job

2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:02.840
 of figuring out what we need.

2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:05.000
 And then the challenge of course is

2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.360
 making sure that people get what they need

2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:09.720
 and making sure that at a societal level,

2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:12.120
 we're not vaulting ourselves into the wrong direction.

2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:16.440
 The biggest problem is that the late waking people,

2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:18.200
 they think that really,

2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:20.680
 and I'm going to try to put it in a better way now,

2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:22.680
 they think, oh, because you're a morning person,

2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:24.120
 you want to see the sun early,

2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:27.280
 so you want me to suffer it dropping late.

2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:29.040
 But that's not the case,

2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:32.760
 because what happens is when they shift it back

2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:34.640
 after the daylight saving,

2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:36.800
 now they're going to make you suffer really badly

2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:39.400
 because now it's going to be earlier.

2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:40.360
 Right, in the fall.

2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:42.240
 In the fall when there's not enough light.

2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:43.800
 If they keep it the same way,

2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:47.280
 so try to convince them that actually this at the end

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:50.120
 causes more trouble when you need the light

2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:52.840
 for your late schedule in the fall

2:03:52.840 --> 2:03:54.440
 when they shift it back.

2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:57.000
 Then they say keep it daylight saving all the time.

2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.200
 And that has been proven.

2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:00.640
 That is very bad.

2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:02.160
 Like people have done studies

2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:05.240
 that literally two areas close to each other's

2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:08.440
 and areas that were the whole year on daylight saving

2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:10.520
 has much more problems,

2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:12.560
 even in cancer rates and depression.

2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:14.080
 So you don't want to do that.

2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:16.840
 So that's what trying to convince people

2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:20.240
 that you need to prevent that switch

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:22.800
 and you don't need daylight saving at all.

2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:25.080
 That's where the problem happens.

2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:26.160
 Interesting.

2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:27.840
 I had not thought about that,

2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:30.280
 but yes, you late risers that in the fall,

2:04:30.280 --> 2:04:32.840
 when they fall back, as they say,

2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:35.240
 spring forward, fall back, you dial back the clock.

2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:39.520
 It's really compounding the problem that already exists.

2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:42.360
 And it's really nice if you keep it consistent.

2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:45.880
 In the spring, you get the equinox

2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:47.920
 and then the days start going up

2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:50.000
 and then even in the summer start going down

2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.440
 and then the fall, you get the other equinox and go back.

2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.640
 So it's very symmetrical, right?

2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:57.880
 It goes into short day, longer, long, long, long,

2:04:57.880 --> 2:04:59.440
 then short day again.

2:04:59.440 --> 2:05:01.360
 But now you're getting these bumps

2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:04.160
 in both sides of the spring and fall.

2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:05.200
 Why would you do that?

2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:07.480
 Something that is beautifully symmetrical,

2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:10.040
 beautifully smooth, you're putting bumps into it.

2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:13.080
 Well, and not just beautiful because it's there,

2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:14.880
 but evolved.

2:05:14.880 --> 2:05:16.640
 I mean, essentially this is the system we evolved in

2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:18.800
 for hundreds of thousands of years.

2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:21.320
 Even apart from the exact equator,

2:05:21.320 --> 2:05:23.640
 every part of the earth has seasonality.

2:05:25.240 --> 2:05:26.760
 I want to briefly touch on something

2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:29.720
 which is individual and genetic variation

2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:31.840
 in sensitivity to light.

2:05:31.840 --> 2:05:36.840
 So not chronotype, but first of all, a very basic question.

2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:42.240
 Do people with light eyes, light colored eyes,

2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:43.760
 are they more sensitive to light

2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:46.000
 than people with darker pigmented eyes?

2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.640
 I mean, honestly, it makes sense they will be more

2:05:48.640 --> 2:05:51.320
 because if you think of my dark pupil,

2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:52.760
 it's blocking more light.

2:05:52.760 --> 2:05:56.640
 So if you have light pupil, yes, for vision,

2:05:56.640 --> 2:05:58.000
 it may not be very obvious,

2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.440
 but for something that is measuring the amount of light,

2:06:00.440 --> 2:06:02.360
 you're getting more light than me.

2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:06.320
 So you'll probably need less light to be effective

2:06:06.320 --> 2:06:08.600
 as somebody who's darker.

2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:11.680
 And that maybe could explain why sometimes lighter people

2:06:11.680 --> 2:06:14.040
 say I don't want to go into very bright conditions

2:06:14.040 --> 2:06:15.480
 because it's really bright.

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:18.120
 Yeah, I can't even be at a cafe

2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:20.800
 without one of these reflective tables, like a metal table,

2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:22.560
 unless I have very dark sunglasses on.

2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:23.400
 Exactly.

2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:24.560
 It's so bright it's painful for me.

2:06:24.560 --> 2:06:25.800
 Whereas some people like you,

2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:28.200
 we've sat outside and had meals and you're like, fine.

2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:31.280
 I assumed it was kind of Jordanian toughness versus, you know.

2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:33.440
 It's really the pupil blocks more light.

2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:36.200
 So I think it is possible that it's as simple

2:06:36.200 --> 2:06:39.040
 as the pupil blocking more light can have sensitivity.

2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:41.480
 But your question also goes deeper.

2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:44.520
 Are there more sensitivity differences?

2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:45.880
 And my understanding would be,

2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:48.360
 I would think that it may be depends

2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:51.880
 on how effective your cells are in responding to light,

2:06:51.880 --> 2:06:54.880
 how healthy your IPRGC's are.

2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:58.160
 So I would, but there's not many studies to show that.

2:06:58.160 --> 2:07:00.400
 What is really clear that is happening

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:03.480
 is that patients with bipolar,

2:07:03.480 --> 2:07:06.000
 they seem to have different sensitivities to light.

2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:07.920
 So it seems that at least people

2:07:07.920 --> 2:07:12.360
 who have psychological changes,

2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:15.400
 they may have differences to the sensitivity of light.

2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:16.240
 So.

2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:20.000
 Are those differences in a particular direction?

2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:21.360
 I don't remember the exact.

2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:22.720
 We'll have to, we can look it up.

2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:23.560
 Yeah.

2:07:23.560 --> 2:07:24.400
 Yeah.

2:07:25.400 --> 2:07:27.440
 And people have heard me say this ad nauseum

2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:29.240
 to the point where they actually roll their eyes,

2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:32.120
 but you know that these are the only two pieces of brain.

2:07:32.120 --> 2:07:33.320
 I'm pointing to my eyes folks

2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:35.040
 that are outside the cranial vault.

2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:36.320
 They are two pieces of brain

2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:38.160
 that it basically inform the brain

2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:40.320
 about whether or not to be alert or asleep.

2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:41.160
 Absolutely.

2:07:41.160 --> 2:07:43.080
 But you can imagine that those two little pieces of brain

2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:46.520
 that we call eyes would have genetic variations.

2:07:46.520 --> 2:07:49.200
 Of course, eye color is genetically modular.

2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:50.380
 Is that determined?

2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:53.280
 That there would be genetic variations

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:55.960
 based on whether or not your ancestry evolved

2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:59.020
 near the equator or further from the equator, right?

2:07:59.020 --> 2:08:01.200
 I mean, you see more blue eyes in Scandinavia

2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:02.040
 than you do in the equator. Absolutely.

2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:03.400
 I mean, it's the lack of light

2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:06.020
 that said you need less inhibition

2:08:06.020 --> 2:08:07.620
 because there's not enough light, right?

2:08:07.620 --> 2:08:10.000
 So that's the idea of the change in color.

2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:13.680
 So yeah, I totally agree with you.

2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:16.840
 I mean, I think this is an area that will be studied later

2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:19.600
 and will be empirically determined.

2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:22.160
 The problem we have in this field right now,

2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:24.360
 which I think is the biggest problem,

2:08:24.360 --> 2:08:26.700
 is we don't have a way to measure

2:08:26.700 --> 2:08:29.200
 the IP RGC sensitivities in humans.

2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:33.300
 So we still, like it's easy to measure your rod cone function

2:08:33.300 --> 2:08:35.040
 if you go to an optometrist.

2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:36.960
 They measure all the details, right?

2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:37.800
 Contrast detection.

2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:40.400
 You look at the chart, you look at the Snellen chart,

2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:42.260
 you look at the letters at the DMV, yeah.

2:08:42.260 --> 2:08:44.560
 But for the non subconscious,

2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:47.640
 we still don't have a good measuring systems

2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:50.600
 to figure out what is Andrew's sensitivity?

2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:51.920
 What is Samer's sensitivity?

2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:53.360
 What is this person's sensitivity?

2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:56.560
 And I think we're starting to work on something like that

2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:58.320
 to hopefully develop these techniques,

2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:00.260
 but till we develop them,

2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:02.440
 it's gonna be very hard to figure out

2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:04.160
 if there is a sensitivity difference,

2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:07.560
 how do they relate on men and women,

2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:10.080
 you know, dark and light and all that,

2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:13.240
 you know, normal versus psychologically effect

2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:14.480
 and stuff like that.

2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:16.120
 Fascinating.

2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:19.940
 And every time you talk, I learned so much.

2:09:19.940 --> 2:09:24.440
 It's like in the best way, the best sense of the term,

2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:27.420
 it's a waterfall of knowledge.

2:09:27.420 --> 2:09:30.440
 As a final question, I have a question about sensitivity

2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:32.500
 of a whole other kind.

2:09:32.500 --> 2:09:36.520
 And that's the sensitivity to spicy food.

2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:38.960
 Now, the reason I'm asking this question,

2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:41.480
 what seemingly out of the blue is that

2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:45.280
 I made the mistake once of having Samer cook for me.

2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:48.420
 And I said, not too spicy.

2:09:48.420 --> 2:09:50.640
 And he said, okay, not too spicy.

2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:52.600
 He actually said, okay, not too spicy.

2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:55.720
 And it almost killed me.

2:09:55.720 --> 2:09:57.940
 Like it was like two or three days.

2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:00.740
 So you know a lot about biology

2:10:00.740 --> 2:10:02.880
 outside the visual system, light, et cetera.

2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:04.240
 You've been around a while.

2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:09.120
 Are there known genetic or inherited

2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:12.240
 of any kind sensitivities to spicy food,

2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:14.200
 to things like red peppers and capsaicin?

2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:17.040
 Because what you call mild,

2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:20.440
 my friend almost put me into the hospital.

2:10:20.440 --> 2:10:23.000
 I think this is similar to you swimming in the ocean

2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:24.440
 and I need to get developed.

2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:25.460
 Okay, true, true.

2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:27.680
 I like cold water swims and Samer's not a fan,

2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:29.160
 but that's going to change.

2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:30.000
 It's adaptable.

2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:31.400
 That's going to change.

2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:32.700
 That's my belief.

2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:34.720
 Before I met Reiji, I was like you.

2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:37.480
 And once I started eating a lot of spicy food,

2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:40.560
 I lost touch of how spicy my food is.

2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:43.240
 So I nearly killed you, Andrew, and I apologize.

2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:44.080
 I forgive you.

2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:45.480
 So basically what you're saying is that marriage

2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:46.320
 toughened you up.

2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:48.240
 Toughened me up, exactly.

2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.080
 Maybe that's the solution.

2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:51.400
 That's what you need, yeah.

2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:55.240
 Samer, this has been an amazing march

2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:57.240
 through the importance of light,

2:10:57.240 --> 2:10:59.520
 not just for regulating sleep and wakefulness,

2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:03.560
 but also for food timing, the interactions with mood,

2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:05.580
 the interactions with exercise.

2:11:05.580 --> 2:11:08.760
 I'm certain that people are going to start thinking

2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:11.240
 about how to change their relationship with light

2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:14.720
 as a way to anchor everything that they do

2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:16.240
 and that's important to their health.

2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:18.480
 And I just, on behalf of all of them

2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:20.800
 and just directly from me as your friend

2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:23.420
 and as a colleague for many years now,

2:11:23.420 --> 2:11:24.400
 I just want to say thank you

2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:26.160
 for the incredible work you're doing

2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:27.560
 and for sharing it with us.

2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:28.400
 Thank you so much.

2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:30.840
 And actually now thinking about all of this,

2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:32.600
 and you said, I should write a book,

2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:35.640
 I should write a book and call it the tripartite model.

2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:38.440
 I think that would put all these components together

2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:41.320
 would be very interesting to do at some point.

2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:42.960
 You should write a book.

2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:44.640
 You should write, they'll probably try and change the title

2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:48.720
 to like Food, Mood and You, you know, or something because,

2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:51.200
 but you can put in little print on the tripartite model

2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:55.200
 or whatever, but regardless of what it's called,

2:11:55.200 --> 2:11:57.000
 you absolutely should write a book.

2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:00.440
 And so if you'd like Samir to write a book

2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:01.780
 or if you'd like to learn more about him,

2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:03.640
 let's talk a little bit about where people can find you.

2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:05.240
 Your laboratory is at the National Institutes

2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:06.360
 of Mental Health.

2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:07.960
 He is head of the Chronobiology Unit,

2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:09.980
 all these things that I've mentioned earlier,

2:12:09.980 --> 2:12:13.480
 but you are active on Twitter and Instagram.

2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:14.320
 Right.

2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:15.920
 So what is your Twitter handle?

2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:18.160
 It's at Samir Hattar.

2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:20.760
 And we will provide a link for that in the show notes.

2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:23.640
 Sorry, yes, at the Twitter at Samir Hattar

2:12:23.640 --> 2:12:26.000
 and I think the same for Instagram, yeah, actually.

2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.580
 And Samir has been coaxed onto Instagram.

2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:30.400
 So he does post from time to time,

2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:34.140
 mostly pictures of food that is incredibly spicy,

2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:37.840
 but also information about chronobiology.

2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:40.020
 He comes on for an Instagram live every once in a while

2:12:40.020 --> 2:12:42.560
 with me and so definitely give him a follow there

2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:44.080
 and on Twitter.

2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:48.920
 And I'm sure that he'll be happy to answer questions

2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:53.720
 and entertain any and all discussions about chronobiology.

2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:57.260
 Absolutely, yeah, and light, yeah.

2:12:57.260 --> 2:12:58.340
 Great, thank you, Samir.

2:12:58.340 --> 2:12:59.880
 Awesome, thank you, Andrew.
