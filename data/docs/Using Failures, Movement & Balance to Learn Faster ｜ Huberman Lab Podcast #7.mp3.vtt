00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.620 --> 00:10.780
 My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:10.780 --> 00:13.540
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.540 --> 00:15.380
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.500
 This podcast is separate

00:16.500 --> 00:18.860
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

00:18.860 --> 00:20.820
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:20.820 --> 00:22.940
 to bring you zero cost to consumer information

00:22.940 --> 00:25.860
 about science and science-related tools.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.940
 In keeping with that theme,

00:26.940 --> 00:29.740
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:29.740 --> 00:32.460
 Our first sponsor is Headspace.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.860
 Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.

00:35.860 --> 00:39.020
 I've been meditating on and off now for about 30 years,

00:39.020 --> 00:41.560
 although I confess more off than on.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.220
 And that's because I think like for a lot of people,

00:44.220 --> 00:47.600
 sticking to a meditation practice can be pretty challenging.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.900
 I started using Headspace a few years ago,

00:49.900 --> 00:51.660
 and I found that it's really allowed me

00:51.660 --> 00:54.460
 to stick to a meditation practice on a regular basis.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.660
 I meditate anywhere from five to seven times a week.

00:57.660 --> 01:00.600
 The app includes meditations that are all backed

01:00.600 --> 01:02.980
 by scientific peer-reviewed studies,

01:02.980 --> 01:04.980
 and it makes it really easy to start

01:04.980 --> 01:06.660
 and complete the meditations.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.060
 I started using these meditations

01:08.060 --> 01:10.380
 while I was flying a few years back.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.300
 On JetBlue flights,

01:11.300 --> 01:12.940
 they started offering Headspace meditation,

01:12.940 --> 01:14.300
 so that's where I initially started,

01:14.300 --> 01:17.100
 and then I moved over to the app, and I really enjoy it,

01:17.100 --> 01:19.220
 and I derive great benefit from it.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.740
 If you'd like to try Headspace,

01:20.740 --> 01:24.140
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer,

01:24.140 --> 01:26.460
 and if you do that, you'll get all the meditations

01:26.460 --> 01:28.980
 that Headspace offers for free for one month.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.140
 That's headspace.com slash special offer.

01:32.140 --> 01:33.500
 You get all the meditations for free,

01:33.500 --> 01:35.860
 which is the best offer that Headspace has

01:35.860 --> 01:37.220
 available right now,

01:37.220 --> 01:39.380
 so if you're interested in it, check it out.

01:39.380 --> 01:42.620
 The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.380
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

01:44.380 --> 01:47.060
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.100
 I started using Athletic Greens in 2012,

01:50.100 --> 01:52.800
 and I've been using it continuously ever since.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.420
 I started using Athletic Greens

01:54.420 --> 01:56.500
 because I found it rather dizzying to know

01:56.500 --> 01:58.660
 which vitamins and minerals to take,

01:58.660 --> 02:00.700
 and Athletic Greens allows me to get

02:00.700 --> 02:03.220
 the full base of all the necessary vitamins and minerals

02:03.220 --> 02:05.640
 in one easy-to-consume drink.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.980
 It also turns out that the drink tastes quite good.

02:07.980 --> 02:10.260
 I mix mine with some lemon juice and some water.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.380
 I'll drink it once or twice a day.

02:12.380 --> 02:15.140
 The probiotics in Athletic Greens are also important to me

02:15.140 --> 02:16.500
 because there are a lot of data now

02:16.500 --> 02:19.540
 supporting the fact that the gut microbiome

02:19.540 --> 02:21.560
 is important for the gut-brain axis,

02:21.560 --> 02:24.500
 for various aspects of cognitive function, immune function,

02:24.500 --> 02:26.020
 metabolic function.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.400
 There's just a huge number of things

02:27.400 --> 02:29.140
 that having a healthy gut microbiome

02:29.140 --> 02:30.580
 has been shown to be important for,

02:30.580 --> 02:32.300
 so by taking Athletic Greens,

02:32.300 --> 02:33.940
 I have that base covered as well.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.360
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

02:36.360 --> 02:39.660
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

02:39.660 --> 02:42.100
 and if you do that, they'll give you a year's supply

02:42.100 --> 02:44.880
 of liquid vitamin D3K2.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.340
 There are also a lot of data now showing

02:46.340 --> 02:48.440
 that vitamin D3 is very important

02:48.440 --> 02:51.240
 for a number of different biological functions.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.460
 In addition, they'll give you five free travel packs

02:54.460 --> 02:55.660
 with your order.

02:55.660 --> 02:58.460
 It can be difficult to mix up powders while on the road,

02:58.460 --> 03:00.540
 you know, when in a car or, you know,

03:00.540 --> 03:03.180
 in a hotel or on a plane, et cetera.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.620
 The travel packs make everything really clean and easy,

03:05.620 --> 03:08.420
 so you'll get the year supply of vitamin D3K2

03:08.420 --> 03:09.940
 plus the five free travel packs

03:09.940 --> 03:13.680
 if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.500
 The third sponsor of today's podcast is Made For.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.160
 Made For is a behavioral science company

03:18.160 --> 03:21.740
 that makes learning positive habits and growth mindset easy.

03:21.740 --> 03:24.380
 I've been involved with Made For since the beginning

03:24.380 --> 03:27.100
 as the lead of their scientific advisory.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.980
 Other members of the scientific advisory include,

03:28.980 --> 03:31.060
 for instance, the head of the Chronobiology Unit

03:31.060 --> 03:33.180
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

03:33.180 --> 03:35.620
 as well as psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School

03:35.620 --> 03:38.080
 and elsewhere, all of whom are serious about science

03:38.080 --> 03:40.660
 and science-related tools for developing positive habits

03:40.660 --> 03:42.500
 and growth mindset.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.580
 The program is a 10-month program

03:44.580 --> 03:47.980
 during which each month you engage in a specific activity

03:47.980 --> 03:50.860
 designed to encourage and cultivate

03:50.860 --> 03:53.220
 positive habits and growth mindset.

03:53.220 --> 03:55.180
 As well, we hold a monthly Zoom call

03:55.180 --> 03:57.060
 during which we discuss the program,

03:57.060 --> 03:58.860
 people's progress, and answer any questions

03:58.860 --> 04:00.140
 they have directly.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.900
 If you'd like to try Made For,

04:01.900 --> 04:04.460
 you can go to getmadefor.com,

04:04.460 --> 04:06.300
 and if you put Huberman in at checkout,

04:06.300 --> 04:07.980
 you'll get 20% off the program.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.580
 That's getmadefor.com.

04:09.580 --> 04:13.680
 Put Huberman in at checkout and get 20% off the program.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.860
 Today, we're going to talk about

04:14.860 --> 04:18.000
 how to change your nervous system for the better.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.460
 As you recall, your nervous system

04:19.460 --> 04:22.280
 includes your brain and your spinal cord,

04:22.280 --> 04:24.500
 but also all the connections that your brain

04:24.500 --> 04:27.500
 and spinal cord make with the organs of your body

04:27.500 --> 04:30.320
 and all the connections that the organs of your body

04:30.320 --> 04:32.540
 make with your brain and spinal cord.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.180
 This thing that we call the nervous system

04:34.180 --> 04:36.820
 is responsible for everything we know,

04:36.820 --> 04:39.400
 all our behavior, all our emotions,

04:39.400 --> 04:42.080
 everything we feel about ourselves and the outside world,

04:42.080 --> 04:45.140
 everything we think and believe, it's really at the center

04:45.140 --> 04:48.440
 of our entire experience of life and who we are.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.420
 Fortunately, in humans, unlike in other species,

04:53.420 --> 04:55.520
 we can change our nervous system

04:55.520 --> 04:58.980
 by taking some very specific and deliberate actions.

04:58.980 --> 05:02.140
 And today, we're really going to focus on the actions,

05:02.140 --> 05:07.140
 the motor commands and the aspects of movement and balance

05:07.560 --> 05:09.860
 that allow us to change our nervous system.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.260
 It turns out that movement and balance

05:12.260 --> 05:16.140
 actually provide windows or portals into our ability

05:16.140 --> 05:18.620
 to change our nervous system the way we want,

05:18.620 --> 05:22.620
 even if those changes are not about learning new movements

05:22.620 --> 05:26.300
 or learning how to balance, and soon you'll understand why.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.020
 So today, we're going to talk a lot

05:28.020 --> 05:31.520
 about the basic science of neuroplasticity.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.100
 I promise to not use excessive nomenclature,

05:34.100 --> 05:35.240
 there'll be a little bit,

05:35.240 --> 05:37.820
 but I'll try and make it as clear as possible.

05:37.820 --> 05:41.540
 And we're also going to talk a lot about protocols and tools

05:41.540 --> 05:45.620
 that the scientific literature points to and supports

05:45.620 --> 05:47.400
 for changing our nervous system.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.380
 Again, not just for sake of learning new motor movements

05:50.380 --> 05:54.000
 or how to balance better, but for how to feel differently

05:54.000 --> 05:57.740
 about particular experiences, both past, present and future,

05:57.740 --> 06:00.660
 as well as how to learn faster.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.640
 We're not going to discuss hacks, a word I loathe,

06:03.640 --> 06:05.600
 we're not going to discuss gimmicks,

06:05.600 --> 06:09.160
 we're going to discuss mechanism and scientific data

06:09.160 --> 06:10.920
 and the tools that those mechanisms

06:10.920 --> 06:12.980
 and scientific data point to

06:12.980 --> 06:16.300
 so that you can tailor your practices around learning

06:16.300 --> 06:19.300
 to your specific needs and goals.

06:19.300 --> 06:23.100
 So let's begin by just examining the big picture question,

06:23.100 --> 06:27.100
 which is does the brain control behavior?

06:27.100 --> 06:30.580
 And my hope is that everyone is immediately thinking yes.

06:30.580 --> 06:33.240
 The brain and nervous system, we really should say,

06:33.240 --> 06:35.580
 because the brain is just one component of the nervous system

06:35.580 --> 06:37.820
 controls our behavior.

06:37.820 --> 06:39.300
 How does it do that?

06:39.300 --> 06:41.060
 Well, there are a couple of different levels

06:41.060 --> 06:42.400
 that it does that.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.140
 First of all, if we're talking about movement,

06:45.140 --> 06:47.680
 behavior generally means movement.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.100
 If we're talking about movement,

06:50.100 --> 06:53.940
 we have two categories of neurons that are very important

06:53.940 --> 06:56.180
 to think about in the context of neuroplasticity.

06:56.180 --> 07:00.980
 First of all, we have what are called lower motor neurons.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.900
 These are motor neurons that live in our spinal cord.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.520
 If for the aficionados out there,

07:06.520 --> 07:08.500
 for those of you that might be head to medical school

07:08.500 --> 07:09.940
 or just want to learn more about the anatomy,

07:09.940 --> 07:11.860
 they live in the ventral horn of the spinal cord,

07:11.860 --> 07:13.260
 but that doesn't matter.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.540
 If you don't want to know that,

07:14.540 --> 07:15.700
 just know that you have these things

07:15.700 --> 07:17.700
 called lower motor neurons.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.180
 These are neurons that are in the spinal cord,

07:20.180 --> 07:22.580
 but they extend a wire that we call an axon

07:22.580 --> 07:26.180
 out into the peripheral nervous system, into the body.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.900
 And those neurons connect with muscle.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.060
 They send electrical potentials out there

07:33.060 --> 07:35.860
 that allow our muscles to twitch and to contract.

07:35.860 --> 07:39.500
 As a little point of fact, actually,

07:39.500 --> 07:41.020
 we don't have muscle memory.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.920
 There's no such thing as muscle memory.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.300
 Muscles are dumb.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.900
 They don't know anything.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.260
 They don't have a history.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.320
 They don't have a memory.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.300
 They don't know anything.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.460
 It is the neurons that control those muscles

07:52.460 --> 07:56.500
 and their firing patterns in which all the information

07:56.500 --> 07:58.820
 for motor patterns are stored.

07:58.820 --> 08:01.400
 So your ability to walk is not muscle memory.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.140
 It's neural memory.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.500
 Now, the lower motor neurons,

08:06.500 --> 08:09.180
 while smarter than the muscle, so to speak,

08:09.180 --> 08:12.180
 are not the most brilliant of the motor neurons.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.340
 They are generally involved in doing what they are told.

08:16.340 --> 08:20.140
 And they are told what to do from two sources.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.580
 We have circuits in our brainstem.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.540
 So this would be kind of around your neck deep in the brain

08:25.540 --> 08:28.180
 that are called central pattern generators.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.940
 These are sometimes called CPGs.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.980
 Central pattern generators are what allow us

08:31.980 --> 08:34.780
 to generate repetitive patterns of movement.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.360
 So inhaling and exhaling, inhaling and exhaling,

08:37.360 --> 08:41.160
 subconsciously is controlled by a central pattern generator.

08:41.160 --> 08:43.000
 That just means a collection of neurons.

08:43.000 --> 08:43.840
 If you really want to know,

08:43.840 --> 08:45.220
 they're called the pre-bot singer neurons

08:45.220 --> 08:47.860
 discovered by Jack Feldman and colleagues at UCLA.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.020
 These neurons in the brainstem send information

08:51.020 --> 08:54.620
 down the phrenic nerve and control the diaphragm.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.700
 So it goes inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.840
 And you don't have to think about that.

08:58.840 --> 08:59.780
 You could think about it,

08:59.780 --> 09:02.140
 and you could change the durations of inhales and exhales

09:02.140 --> 09:03.380
 and change that up.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.060
 But the motor neurons that control that

09:06.060 --> 09:09.340
 are just responding to what the brain is telling it to do.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.180
 The other central pattern generators

09:13.180 --> 09:15.860
 include things like walking.

09:15.860 --> 09:19.840
 The right limb, left limb, right limb, left limb pattern

09:19.840 --> 09:21.820
 that we normally associate with walking

09:21.820 --> 09:23.300
 was learned during childhood.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.620
 And the central pattern generator, sometimes called CPGs,

09:26.620 --> 09:29.980
 tell our lower motor neurons fire.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.380
 Now you fire, now you fire.

09:31.380 --> 09:34.600
 So they are literally saying right, left, right, left.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.000
 They are the marching orders from the brainstem

09:37.000 --> 09:38.380
 to the lower motor neurons.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.320
 So these lower motor neurons do what they are told.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.140
 They are obedient little soldiers

09:42.140 --> 09:43.980
 and they do what they are told.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.220
 And their job is to make the muscles

09:46.220 --> 09:49.440
 contract at specific times.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.140
 Okay, that's all simple.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.360
 But then there are the upper motor neurons.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.820
 The upper motor neurons actually reside in our motor cortex

09:58.820 --> 10:01.020
 way up on top of the brain.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.360
 And they are involved in sending signals

10:04.360 --> 10:06.500
 for deliberate action.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.340
 Okay, so they send signals to the lower motor neurons

10:09.340 --> 10:10.260
 which are the effectors,

10:10.260 --> 10:12.860
 the ones that actually control the muscles,

10:12.860 --> 10:14.940
 but the upper motor neurons are the ones

10:14.940 --> 10:17.020
 that send very specific signals.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.180
 For instance, the signals that would allow you

10:19.180 --> 10:20.940
 to make a cup of coffee in the morning

10:20.940 --> 10:24.020
 or to deliberately engage in any kind of behavior.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.200
 Now you can probably make a cup of coffee in the morning

10:26.200 --> 10:27.640
 without having to think about it too much.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.640
 It's almost reflexive for you now,

10:29.640 --> 10:31.940
 which means that a lot of the information

10:31.940 --> 10:34.540
 about how to perform that particular movement

10:34.540 --> 10:37.220
 has been passed off to circuitry

10:37.220 --> 10:40.020
 that's now more or less in the brainstem

10:40.020 --> 10:42.260
 and below the motor cortex.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.380
 Now, why am I giving you all this detail?

10:44.380 --> 10:48.200
 Well, if you want to change motor patterns,

10:48.200 --> 10:51.740
 you have to know where in the circuitry changes are possible

10:51.740 --> 10:54.260
 and you ought to know where the changes

10:54.260 --> 10:56.300
 are most likely to occur.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.980
 You also need to know how do you signal

10:58.980 --> 11:03.500
 to the brain and nervous system that a change is necessary.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.560
 So let's just pause there,

11:05.560 --> 11:07.800
 return to the initial question that we started with,

11:07.800 --> 11:10.180
 which is does the brain control behavior?

11:10.180 --> 11:12.740
 And the answer is yes, and now you know how.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.780
 It's upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.680
 You've got these things called central pattern generators

11:17.680 --> 11:18.880
 and some connection with the muscle.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.720
 So there you go.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.660
 So we've just got basically what was the equivalent

11:22.660 --> 11:25.260
 of the introduction to a college lecture

11:25.260 --> 11:27.560
 on motor control in the nervous system,

11:27.560 --> 11:30.220
 but the point today is all about plasticity.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.940
 How can that be leveraged in order to open up

11:33.940 --> 11:36.740
 this magical thing that we call plasticity

11:36.740 --> 11:40.500
 in order to access changes to our emotional experience

11:40.500 --> 11:45.500
 or to our belief system or to our ability to remember

11:45.500 --> 11:47.380
 and use specific kinds of information

11:47.380 --> 11:50.380
 for say math or language, et cetera?

11:50.380 --> 11:52.980
 Well, what I'm not going to tell you

11:52.980 --> 11:56.340
 is that you need to go running or you need to go biking

11:56.340 --> 11:59.260
 or that simply going through motor patterns

11:59.260 --> 12:00.840
 is going to open up plasticity,

12:00.840 --> 12:02.340
 because I hate to tell you this,

12:02.340 --> 12:04.960
 but as beneficial as exercise is,

12:04.960 --> 12:09.960
 it does not open plasticity unless you do certain things.

12:10.180 --> 12:11.440
 And I will tell you exactly

12:11.440 --> 12:13.620
 what those certain things are today.

12:13.620 --> 12:16.120
 To be clear, I think exercise is wonderful and healthy,

12:16.120 --> 12:17.660
 can improve cardiovascular function,

12:17.660 --> 12:20.420
 maintain strength, bone density, all that good stuff,

12:20.420 --> 12:23.600
 but just working out or doing your exercise

12:23.600 --> 12:26.680
 of various kinds will not change your nervous system.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.860
 It will maintain it

12:27.860 --> 12:30.320
 and it can certainly improve other health metrics,

12:30.320 --> 12:33.920
 but it is not going to open up the window for plasticity.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.680
 The question we need to ask

12:37.680 --> 12:40.260
 is can behavior change the brain?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.240
 We already agreed that the brain can change behavior,

12:43.240 --> 12:46.220
 but can behavior change the brain?

12:46.220 --> 12:47.740
 And the answer is yes,

12:47.740 --> 12:52.580
 provided that behavior is different enough in specific ways

12:52.580 --> 12:55.820
 from the behaviors that you already know how to perform.

12:55.820 --> 12:56.920
 Let me repeat that.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.880
 Can behavior change the brain?

12:58.880 --> 13:00.420
 And the answer is yes,

13:00.420 --> 13:03.160
 provided that behavior is different enough

13:03.160 --> 13:04.480
 from the sorts of behaviors

13:04.480 --> 13:06.940
 that you already know how to perform.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.280
 And I should have added the word well,

13:09.280 --> 13:11.740
 because you can't obviously perform a behavior

13:11.740 --> 13:13.540
 that you don't know how to perform

13:13.540 --> 13:14.940
 because you don't know how to do it yet.

13:14.940 --> 13:19.440
 But there's a key element to accessing neuroplasticity

13:19.440 --> 13:22.000
 that frankly, I don't see out there

13:22.000 --> 13:25.060
 in the general discussion about neuroplasticity.

13:25.060 --> 13:27.220
 In the general discussion about neuroplasticity

13:27.220 --> 13:29.200
 and about learning, I hear all these gimmicks

13:29.200 --> 13:31.100
 about using different ways to remember

13:31.100 --> 13:32.220
 lots of people's names

13:32.220 --> 13:34.600
 and arranging things into their first letters

13:34.600 --> 13:36.320
 and mnemonics and all this kind of stuff,

13:36.320 --> 13:38.860
 which frankly to me feels really gimmicky.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.320
 And I think that if you look at super learners,

13:42.320 --> 13:44.960
 they tend to be people that have a process

13:44.960 --> 13:47.440
 of say extreme memory,

13:47.440 --> 13:49.800
 but people who have extreme memory,

13:49.800 --> 13:51.760
 generally the literature shows us

13:51.760 --> 13:53.760
 are pretty poor at other things.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.240
 So I don't think most of us are interested

13:56.240 --> 13:58.880
 in walking around knowing how to remember everything.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.900
 In fact, there are some interesting studies

14:00.900 --> 14:04.600
 looking at humans who over-remember

14:04.600 --> 14:06.040
 and they suffer tremendously

14:06.040 --> 14:07.520
 because they remember all sorts of things

14:07.520 --> 14:09.880
 like the number at the top of the receipt at the bodega

14:09.880 --> 14:12.400
 that they bought at Coca-Cola 10 years ago.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.120
 This is useless information for most people.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.960
 They don't do well in life really.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.720
 So the goal isn't to remember everything,

14:20.720 --> 14:23.600
 the goal is to be selective about your brain changes.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.200
 And when we talk about brain changes,

14:25.200 --> 14:28.300
 I want to highlight adaptive changes.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.800
 There's a whole category of things

14:29.800 --> 14:30.680
 that we're going to discuss

14:30.680 --> 14:33.000
 when we talk about traumatic brain injury and dementia,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.480
 a topic for a future episode,

14:35.480 --> 14:38.840
 about all the things that happen when you have damaged

14:38.840 --> 14:40.520
 your nervous system or you're missing neurons.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.000
 But today I really want to talk about something

14:43.000 --> 14:45.200
 that I think is very near and dear to many of your hearts,

14:45.200 --> 14:47.880
 which is what are the behaviors that you can engage in

14:47.880 --> 14:50.120
 to access neuroplasticity

14:51.220 --> 14:54.400
 so that then you can apply that plasticity

14:54.400 --> 14:57.420
 to the specific things that you want to learn or unlearn.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.360
 This is very important because I don't want people

15:01.360 --> 15:03.920
 to get the impression that we're really talking

15:03.920 --> 15:05.880
 about learning a bunch of motor movements.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.840
 You may be an athlete, you might not be an athlete.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.260
 You might want to learn how to dance, you might not.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.560
 You might want to learn how to dance

15:11.560 --> 15:14.120
 and get better at remembering and learning languages,

15:14.120 --> 15:16.640
 for instance, or at unlearning

15:16.640 --> 15:19.720
 some difficult emotional experience,

15:19.720 --> 15:21.680
 meaning you want to remove the emotional load

15:21.680 --> 15:24.080
 from a particular memory of an experience.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.320
 What we're talking about today is using behavior

15:26.320 --> 15:30.840
 as a gate to enter states of mind and body

15:30.840 --> 15:33.880
 that allow you to access plasticity.

15:35.020 --> 15:37.220
 So let's talk about the different kinds of plasticity

15:37.220 --> 15:39.420
 that are available to us,

15:39.420 --> 15:41.480
 because those will point directly

15:41.480 --> 15:44.800
 towards the type of protocols that we should engage in

15:44.800 --> 15:46.580
 to change ourselves for the better,

15:46.580 --> 15:48.500
 the so-called adaptive plasticity.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.740
 There is something called representational plasticity.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.200
 Representational plasticity

15:54.200 --> 15:57.280
 is just your internal representation of the outside world.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.220
 So you have a map of auditory space, believe it or not,

16:00.220 --> 16:02.080
 meaning you have neurons that respond

16:02.080 --> 16:04.300
 when something over on my right happens,

16:04.300 --> 16:06.360
 like I'm snapping my fingers over to my right,

16:06.360 --> 16:07.560
 can't snap as well on my left,

16:07.560 --> 16:11.000
 which is the whole thing into itself.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.840
 Yeah, weak over there on the left side.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.400
 But when I do that,

16:14.400 --> 16:17.320
 there are different neurons respond to those.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.240
 We have a map of visual space.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.520
 Certain neurons are seeing things

16:20.520 --> 16:22.640
 in certain portions of visual space and not others.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.300
 We have a map of motor space,

16:25.300 --> 16:27.760
 meaning when we move our limbs in particular directions,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.020
 we know where those limbs are,

16:30.020 --> 16:32.200
 because even if we can't see them,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.440
 we have what's called proprioceptive feedback.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.580
 So we have knowledge about where our limbs are.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.960
 In fact, people that lack certain neurons

16:38.960 --> 16:41.060
 for proprioceptive feedback,

16:41.060 --> 16:44.120
 they are very poor at controlling their motor behavior.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.200
 They get injured a lot.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.520
 It's actually a terrible situation.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.920
 So we've got all these representations inside,

16:51.920 --> 16:56.160
 and we have maps of our motor commands.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.340
 We know that, for instance,

16:57.340 --> 16:59.180
 if I want to reach out and grab the pen in front of me,

16:59.180 --> 17:01.460
 that I need to generate a certain amount of force,

17:01.460 --> 17:03.260
 so I rarely overshoot.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.760
 I rarely miss the pen, okay?

17:05.760 --> 17:08.480
 So our maps of the motor world

17:08.480 --> 17:11.440
 and our maps of the sensory world are merged.

17:12.420 --> 17:16.520
 The way to create plasticity

17:16.520 --> 17:21.280
 is to create mismatches or errors in how we perform things.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.220
 And this, I think, is an amazing and important feature

17:24.220 --> 17:27.000
 of neuroplasticity that is highly underappreciated.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.800
 The way to create plasticity

17:30.800 --> 17:35.340
 is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong,

17:35.340 --> 17:38.840
 something is different, and something isn't being achieved.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.480
 I think this will completely reframe

17:40.480 --> 17:42.240
 the way that most people think about plasticity.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.240
 Most of us think about plasticity as,

17:44.240 --> 17:47.080
 okay, we're going to get into this optimal learning state

17:47.080 --> 17:49.240
 or flow, and then suddenly we're going to be able

17:49.240 --> 17:51.460
 to do all the things that we wish that we could do.

17:51.460 --> 17:52.400
 Well, I hate to break it to you,

17:52.400 --> 17:56.920
 but flow is an expression of what we already know how to do.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.760
 It is not a state for learning.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.840
 And I'm willing to go to bat

17:59.840 --> 18:02.880
 with any of the flow anistas out there

18:02.880 --> 18:04.680
 that want to challenge me on that one.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.960
 Flow is an expression of nervous system capabilities

18:07.960 --> 18:10.760
 that are already embedded in us.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.360
 Errors and making errors out of sync

18:14.360 --> 18:16.080
 with what we would like to do

18:16.080 --> 18:18.360
 is how our nervous system is cued

18:18.360 --> 18:20.960
 through very distinct biological mechanisms

18:20.960 --> 18:23.480
 that something isn't going right,

18:23.480 --> 18:26.680
 and therefore certain neurochemicals are deployed

18:26.680 --> 18:30.920
 that'll signal the neural circuits that they have to change.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.480
 So let's talk about the experiments

18:32.480 --> 18:33.640
 that support what I just said,

18:33.640 --> 18:36.160
 because I'm about to tell you that making errors

18:36.160 --> 18:38.280
 over and over and over again

18:38.280 --> 18:40.280
 is the route to shaping your nervous system

18:40.280 --> 18:43.080
 so that it performs better and better and better.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.380
 And I'm not going to tell you that the last rep of a set

18:46.380 --> 18:47.920
 where you hit failure in the gym

18:47.920 --> 18:50.280
 is anything like neuroplasticity.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.240
 You hear that too, that it's pushing to that point

18:53.240 --> 18:55.900
 of a cliff where you just can't function anymore.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.900
 That's the signal, that's not the signal.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.800
 That's a distinct neuromuscular phenomenon

18:59.800 --> 19:01.520
 that bears zero resemblance

19:01.520 --> 19:03.720
 to what it takes to get neuroplasticity.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.560
 So let's talk about errors and making errors

19:06.560 --> 19:09.720
 and why and how that triggers the release of chemicals

19:09.720 --> 19:11.920
 that then allow us to not just learn the thing

19:11.920 --> 19:13.840
 that we're doing in the motor sense,

19:13.840 --> 19:15.940
 play the piano, dance, et cetera,

19:15.940 --> 19:19.800
 but it also creates an environment to milieu within the brain

19:19.800 --> 19:23.800
 that allows us to then go learn how to couple

19:23.800 --> 19:26.200
 or uncouple a particular emotion to an experience

19:26.200 --> 19:29.760
 or better language learning or better mathematical learning.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.200
 It's a really fundamental aspect of how we're built.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.480
 And when you look at it,

19:34.480 --> 19:36.000
 it's actually very straightforward.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.920
 It's a series of logical steps

19:37.920 --> 19:40.120
 that once you learn how to open those hatches,

19:40.120 --> 19:43.020
 it becomes very straightforward to deploy.

19:43.020 --> 19:45.680
 Last episode, we discussed some of the basic principles

19:45.680 --> 19:47.520
 of neuroplasticity.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.520
 If you didn't hear that episode, no problem.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.280
 I'll just review it quickly,

19:52.280 --> 19:56.440
 which is that it's a falsehood that everything that we do

19:56.440 --> 19:58.360
 and experience changes our brain.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.600
 The brain changes when certain neurochemicals,

20:00.600 --> 20:04.080
 namely acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine

20:04.080 --> 20:07.880
 are released in ways and in the specific times

20:07.880 --> 20:10.840
 that allow for neural circuits to be marked for change

20:10.840 --> 20:13.120
 and then the change occurs later during sleep.

20:13.120 --> 20:13.980
 I'll review that later,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.600
 but basically you need a certain cocktail of chemicals

20:16.600 --> 20:19.120
 released in the brain in order for a particular behavior

20:19.120 --> 20:22.620
 to reshape the way that our brain works.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.880
 So the question really is,

20:23.880 --> 20:26.580
 what allows those neurochemicals to be released?

20:26.580 --> 20:28.960
 And last episode, it talked all about focus.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.500
 If you haven't seen or heard that episode,

20:31.500 --> 20:32.760
 you might want to check it out

20:32.760 --> 20:35.060
 about some specific tools and practices

20:35.060 --> 20:37.740
 that can allow you to build up your capacity for focus

20:37.740 --> 20:40.320
 and release certain chemicals in that cocktail.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.180
 But today we're going to talk about the other chemicals

20:42.180 --> 20:45.560
 in the cocktail, in particular dopamine.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.560
 And we're really going to center our discussion

20:48.560 --> 20:51.820
 around this issue of making errors

20:51.820 --> 20:54.760
 and why making errors is actually the signal

20:54.760 --> 20:57.000
 that tells the brain, okay, it's time to change,

20:57.000 --> 21:01.240
 or more generally, it's time to pay attention to things

21:01.240 --> 21:03.220
 so that you change.

21:03.220 --> 21:07.400
 And I really want to distinguish this point really clearly,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.320
 which is that I'm going to talk today a lot about motor

21:10.320 --> 21:12.880
 and vestibular, meaning balance programs,

21:12.880 --> 21:16.800
 but not just for learning motor commands and balance,

21:16.800 --> 21:18.720
 not just for learning new motor skills and balance,

21:18.720 --> 21:21.980
 but also for setting a stage or a kind of condition

21:21.980 --> 21:24.760
 in your brain where you can go learn other things as well.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.540
 So let's talk about some classic experiments

21:27.540 --> 21:31.040
 that really nail down what's most important

21:31.040 --> 21:33.540
 in this discussion about plasticity.

21:33.540 --> 21:34.720
 So I mentioned last episode,

21:34.720 --> 21:36.440
 and I'll just tell you right now, again,

21:36.440 --> 21:40.320
 the brain is incredibly plastic from about birth

21:40.320 --> 21:42.040
 until about age 25.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.600
 Passive experience will shape the brain

21:44.600 --> 21:46.880
 just because of the way that the chemicals

21:46.880 --> 21:48.380
 that are sloshing around in there

21:48.380 --> 21:50.000
 and the way that the neurons are arranged

21:50.000 --> 21:51.200
 and all sorts of things.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.620
 The brain's job is to customize itself

21:53.620 --> 21:55.080
 in response to its experience.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.280
 And then somewhere about 25,

21:57.280 --> 21:59.640
 it's not like the day after your 26th birthday,

21:59.640 --> 22:01.040
 plasticity closes.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.600
 There's a kind of tapering off of plasticity,

22:03.600 --> 22:06.120
 and you need different mechanisms

22:06.120 --> 22:08.220
 to engage plasticity as an adult.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.520
 We're mostly going to be talking about adult plasticity today

22:11.520 --> 22:13.480
 but I got a lot of questions about,

22:13.480 --> 22:15.920
 well, what about if I'm younger than 25?

22:15.920 --> 22:17.620
 Well, first of all, that's great.

22:18.760 --> 22:22.200
 I wish I had a time machine, but I don't.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.840
 Because as I've said before,

22:23.840 --> 22:25.560
 the stinger is when you're young,

22:25.560 --> 22:26.660
 your brain is very plastic,

22:26.660 --> 22:28.620
 but you have less control over your experience.

22:28.620 --> 22:29.520
 When you're older,

22:29.520 --> 22:31.520
 generally you have more control over your experience,

22:31.520 --> 22:33.360
 but your brain is less plastic.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.080
 So if you're already asking the question

22:35.080 --> 22:36.800
 as a 20-year-old or a 15-year-old,

22:36.800 --> 22:40.200
 what can I do now that's really gonna enhance my brain?

22:40.200 --> 22:42.080
 I guess the simple question would answer,

22:42.080 --> 22:43.600
 excuse me, would be an aside

22:43.600 --> 22:46.640
 which we get the broadest education you can possible.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.600
 That means math, chemistry, physics, literature, music,

22:50.600 --> 22:51.760
 learn how to play an instrument.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.440
 I'm saying that because I wish I had, et cetera.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.560
 Get a broad training in a number of things

22:56.560 --> 22:59.000
 and find the thing that really captures your passion

22:59.000 --> 23:03.220
 and excitement and then put a ton of additional effort there.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.480
 That's what I recommend, including emotional development.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.560
 Maybe a topic for a future episode.

23:08.560 --> 23:13.560
 But if you are an adult or if you are a young person,

23:14.640 --> 23:17.760
 knowing how to tap into these plasticity mechanisms

23:17.760 --> 23:19.800
 is very powerful.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.680
 You need these chemicals deployed in the nervous system

23:22.680 --> 23:25.880
 in order to mark whatever nerve cells happen to be firing

23:25.880 --> 23:27.760
 in the time afterward for change.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.720
 And people are obsessed with asking,

23:30.720 --> 23:34.360
 what supplements, what drugs, what conditions,

23:34.360 --> 23:37.000
 what machines will allow for that?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.500
 But there's a natural set of conditions that allow for that.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.360
 When we came into this world,

23:42.360 --> 23:46.960
 we learned to take our different maps of experience,

23:46.960 --> 23:50.460
 our motor maps, our auditory maps, our visual maps,

23:50.460 --> 23:53.840
 and to link them, we align those maps.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.000
 The simplest example is the one I gave before.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.480
 If I hear something off to my right, like a click,

23:58.480 --> 24:00.160
 like that, it could come from my finger snapping

24:00.160 --> 24:03.660
 or it could come from something generated by somebody else

24:03.660 --> 24:07.360
 or something else to my right, I look to my right.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.920
 If I hear it on the left, I look to my left.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.580
 If I hear it right in front of me,

24:11.580 --> 24:12.880
 I keep looking right in front of me.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.920
 And if I hear it behind me, I turn around.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.720
 And that's because our maps of visual space

24:18.720 --> 24:23.720
 and our maps of auditory space and our maps of motor space

24:23.840 --> 24:27.120
 are aligned to one another in perfect register.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.160
 It's an incredible feature of our nervous system.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.700
 It takes place in a structure called the superior colliculus,

24:31.700 --> 24:33.920
 although you don't need to know that name.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.840
 Superior colliculus has layers,

24:35.840 --> 24:39.620
 literally stacks of neurons like in a sandwich

24:39.620 --> 24:42.520
 where the zero point right in front of me,

24:42.520 --> 24:45.000
 or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right

24:45.000 --> 24:47.220
 or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left

24:47.220 --> 24:50.560
 are aligned so that the auditory neurons,

24:50.560 --> 24:54.340
 the ones that care about sounds at 15 degrees to my right,

24:54.340 --> 24:58.140
 sit directly below the neurons that look at 15 degrees

24:58.140 --> 25:00.040
 to my right in my visual system.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.080
 And when I reach over to this direction,

25:03.080 --> 25:05.960
 there's a signal that's sent down through those layers

25:05.960 --> 25:07.720
 that says 15 degrees off to the right

25:07.720 --> 25:11.180
 is the direction to look, it's the direction to listen,

25:11.180 --> 25:14.200
 and it's the direction to move if I need to move.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.920
 So there's an alignment, and this is really powerful.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.920
 And this is what allows us to move through space

25:18.920 --> 25:22.220
 and function in our lives in a really fluid way.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.240
 It's set up during development,

25:24.240 --> 25:26.880
 but there have been some important experiments

25:26.880 --> 25:30.860
 that have revealed that these maps are plastic,

25:30.860 --> 25:34.120
 meaning they can shift, they're subject to neuroplasticity,

25:34.120 --> 25:38.280
 and there are specific rules that allow us to shift them.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.800
 So here's the key experiment.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.600
 The key experiment was done by a colleague of mine,

25:44.600 --> 25:47.440
 who's now retired, but whose work is absolutely fundamental

25:47.440 --> 25:50.280
 in the field of neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.860
 The Knudsen lab and many of the Knudsen lab

25:52.860 --> 25:57.440
 scientific offspring showed that if one

25:57.440 --> 26:01.300
 is to wear prism glasses that shift the visual field,

26:02.320 --> 26:05.040
 that eventually there'll be a shift

26:05.040 --> 26:08.520
 in the representation of the auditory and motor maps too.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.800
 Now, what they initially did

26:09.800 --> 26:12.040
 is they looked at young subjects,

26:12.900 --> 26:16.080
 and what they did is they moved the visual world

26:16.080 --> 26:18.440
 by making them wear prism glasses,

26:18.440 --> 26:21.800
 so that for instance, if my pen is out in front of me

26:21.800 --> 26:23.620
 at five degrees off center,

26:23.620 --> 26:24.880
 so just a little bit off center,

26:24.880 --> 26:25.720
 if you're listening to this,

26:25.720 --> 26:28.280
 this would be like just a little bit to my right,

26:28.280 --> 26:30.440
 but in these prism glasses,

26:30.440 --> 26:34.760
 I actually see that pen way over far on my right,

26:34.760 --> 26:37.880
 so it's actually here, but I see it over there

26:37.880 --> 26:39.920
 because I'm wearing prisms on my eyes.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.800
 What happens is in the first day or so,

26:41.800 --> 26:45.120
 you ask people or you ask animal subjects or whatever

26:45.120 --> 26:47.360
 to reach for this object,

26:47.360 --> 26:49.400
 and they reach to the wrong place

26:49.400 --> 26:52.440
 because they're seeing it where it isn't.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.920
 This gets especially complicated

26:53.920 --> 26:55.360
 when you start including sounds,

26:55.360 --> 26:59.600
 when you have a thing off to your right making a sound,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.720
 but the thing is actually right here,

27:01.720 --> 27:03.860
 so you're hearing the sound at one location

27:03.860 --> 27:06.140
 and you're seeing the object at another location

27:06.140 --> 27:07.600
 because you're wearing these prisms,

27:07.600 --> 27:10.340
 so your image of the world is totally distorted.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.840
 Or in experiments done by other groups,

27:13.840 --> 27:16.360
 they wear glasses, subjects wear glasses

27:16.360 --> 27:18.920
 that completely invert the visual world

27:18.920 --> 27:20.620
 so that everything is upside down,

27:20.620 --> 27:24.040
 which is an extreme example of these representational maps

27:24.040 --> 27:25.500
 being flipped or shifted.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.760
 But what you find is that in young individuals,

27:29.760 --> 27:31.560
 within a day or two,

27:31.560 --> 27:34.600
 they start adjusting their motor behavior

27:34.600 --> 27:36.680
 in exactly the right way

27:36.680 --> 27:39.080
 so that they always reach to the correct location.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.720
 So they hear a sound at one location,

27:40.720 --> 27:43.440
 they see the object that ought to make that sound

27:43.440 --> 27:44.560
 at a different location,

27:44.560 --> 27:48.120
 and they somehow are able to adjust their motor behavior

27:48.120 --> 27:50.520
 to reach to the correct location.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.720
 It's incredible, it's absolutely incredible.

27:52.720 --> 27:53.720
 Or in the case of the people

27:53.720 --> 27:55.840
 who look at the world upside down,

27:55.840 --> 27:59.800
 they somehow are able to navigate this upside down world

27:59.800 --> 28:01.840
 even though we're completely used to

28:01.840 --> 28:03.980
 our feet being on the floor and not on the ceiling

28:03.980 --> 28:05.120
 and people not walking at us

28:05.120 --> 28:08.640
 by hanging off the ceiling like bats, amazing.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.000
 And what it tells us is that these maps

28:11.000 --> 28:12.520
 that are aligned to one another

28:12.520 --> 28:17.520
 can move and shift and rotate and even flip themselves.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.200
 And it happens best in young individuals.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.760
 If you do this in older individuals,

28:23.760 --> 28:26.740
 in most cases it takes a very long time

28:26.740 --> 28:29.580
 for the maps to shift and in some cases they never shift.

28:29.580 --> 28:31.680
 So this is a very experimental scenario

28:31.680 --> 28:33.460
 but it's an important one to understand

28:33.460 --> 28:36.840
 because it really tamps down the fact

28:36.840 --> 28:41.060
 that we have the capacity to create dramatic shifts

28:41.060 --> 28:43.220
 in our representation of the outside world.

28:43.220 --> 28:48.220
 So how can we get plasticity as adult

28:49.480 --> 28:53.160
 that mimics the plasticity that we get when we are juveniles?

28:53.160 --> 28:56.160
 Well, the Knudsen lab and other labs have looked at this

28:56.160 --> 28:57.960
 and it's really interesting.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.040
 First of all, we have to ask

28:59.040 --> 29:00.720
 what is the signal for plasticity?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.760
 Is it just having prism glasses on?

29:02.760 --> 29:05.760
 No, because they did that experiment and ruled that out.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.740
 Is it just the fact that the visual thing is over to my,

29:09.740 --> 29:11.360
 appears to be far over to my right

29:11.360 --> 29:13.040
 when in fact it's right in front of me?

29:13.040 --> 29:17.800
 No, the signal that generates the plasticity

29:17.800 --> 29:21.160
 is the making of errors.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.480
 It's the reaches and failures

29:23.480 --> 29:28.480
 that signal to the nervous system that this is not working

29:29.140 --> 29:32.600
 and therefore the shifts start to take place.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.640
 And this is so fundamentally important

29:34.640 --> 29:36.740
 because I think most people think,

29:36.740 --> 29:38.440
 oh, well, practice is gonna be,

29:38.440 --> 29:40.340
 I have to access beginner's mind,

29:40.340 --> 29:41.640
 which is a great concept actually.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.840
 It's about approaching things, expecting to make errors,

29:43.840 --> 29:44.680
 which is great.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.360
 I think I am a believer in beginner's mind,

29:47.360 --> 29:50.880
 but people understandably get frustrated.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.640
 Like they're trying to learn a piece on the piano

29:52.640 --> 29:54.080
 and they don't know, they can't do it

29:54.080 --> 29:55.480
 or they're trying to write a piece of code

29:55.480 --> 29:57.800
 or they're trying to access some sort of motor behavior

29:57.800 --> 29:58.880
 and they can't do it.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.760
 And the frustration drives them crazy.

30:00.760 --> 30:01.900
 And like, I can't do it, I can't do it.

30:01.900 --> 30:05.520
 When they don't realize that the errors themselves

30:05.520 --> 30:07.560
 are signaling to the brain and nervous system,

30:07.560 --> 30:09.000
 something's not working.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.480
 And of course the brain doesn't understand the words,

30:11.480 --> 30:13.280
 something isn't working.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.040
 The brain doesn't even understand frustration

30:15.040 --> 30:16.640
 as an emotional state.

30:16.640 --> 30:20.720
 The brain understands the neurochemicals that are released,

30:20.720 --> 30:24.680
 namely epinephrine and acetylcholine,

30:24.680 --> 30:27.560
 but also, and we'll get into this, the molecule dopamine,

30:27.560 --> 30:30.200
 when we start to approximate the correct behavior

30:30.200 --> 30:34.260
 just a little bit and we start getting a little bit right.

30:34.260 --> 30:37.000
 So what happens is when we make errors,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.760
 the nervous system kind of, I don't wanna say freaks out

30:39.760 --> 30:42.380
 because it's a very mechanistic and controlled situation,

30:42.380 --> 30:45.080
 but the nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters

30:45.080 --> 30:46.880
 and neuromodulators that say,

30:46.880 --> 30:49.000
 we better change something in the circuitry.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.240
 And so errors are the basis for neuroplasticity

30:52.240 --> 30:53.280
 and for learning.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.400
 And I wish that this was more prominent out there.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.520
 I guess this is why I'm saying it.

30:58.520 --> 31:02.000
 And humans do not like this feeling of frustration

31:02.000 --> 31:03.220
 and making errors.

31:03.220 --> 31:07.400
 The few that do, do exceedingly well in whatever pursuits

31:07.400 --> 31:09.080
 they happen to be involved in.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.040
 The ones that don't generally don't do well.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.520
 They generally don't learn much.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.360
 And if you think about it,

31:14.360 --> 31:16.980
 why would your nervous system ever change?

31:16.980 --> 31:18.480
 Why would it ever change?

31:18.480 --> 31:20.760
 Unless there was something to be afraid of,

31:20.760 --> 31:22.620
 something that made us feel awful will signal

31:22.620 --> 31:24.360
 that the nervous system needs to change,

31:24.360 --> 31:26.800
 or there's an error in our performance.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.040
 So it turns out that the feedback of these errors,

31:30.040 --> 31:32.560
 the reaching to the wrong location

31:32.560 --> 31:34.880
 starts to release a number of things.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.600
 And now you've heard about them many times,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.280
 but this would be epinephrine, it increases alertness,

31:40.220 --> 31:41.760
 acetylcholine focus.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.280
 And this is why frustration that leads us

31:44.280 --> 31:46.600
 to just kind of quit and walk away from the endeavor

31:46.600 --> 31:48.500
 is the absolute worst thing.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.080
 But because if acetylcholine is released,

31:51.080 --> 31:55.240
 it creates an opportunity to focus on the error margin,

31:55.240 --> 31:57.680
 the distance between what it is that you're doing

31:57.680 --> 31:59.800
 and what it is that you would like to do.

31:59.800 --> 32:03.760
 And then the nervous system starts to make changes

32:03.760 --> 32:05.440
 almost immediately in order to try

32:05.440 --> 32:06.800
 and get the behavior right.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.080
 And when you start getting it even a little bit right,

32:09.080 --> 32:11.960
 that third molecule comes online or is released,

32:11.960 --> 32:13.240
 which is dopamine,

32:13.240 --> 32:16.240
 which allows for the plastic changes to occur very fast.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.200
 Now, this is what all happens very naturally

32:18.200 --> 32:21.020
 in young brains, but in old brains,

32:21.020 --> 32:25.200
 it tends to be pretty slow except for in two conditions.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.920
 So let me just pause and just say this.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.360
 If you are uncomfortable making errors

32:29.360 --> 32:32.620
 and you get frustrated easily,

32:32.620 --> 32:37.520
 if you leverage that frustration

32:37.520 --> 32:40.120
 toward drilling deeper into the endeavor,

32:40.120 --> 32:41.520
 you are setting yourself up

32:41.520 --> 32:46.040
 for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.360
 But if you take that frustration

32:47.360 --> 32:49.360
 and you walk away from the endeavor,

32:49.360 --> 32:52.280
 you are essentially setting up plasticity

32:52.280 --> 32:55.260
 to rewire you according to what happens afterwards,

32:55.260 --> 32:57.340
 which is generally feeling pretty miserable.

32:57.340 --> 32:59.780
 So now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is

32:59.780 --> 33:02.020
 that continuing to drill into a process

33:02.020 --> 33:03.260
 to the point of frustration,

33:03.260 --> 33:06.500
 but then staying with that process for a little bit longer,

33:06.500 --> 33:08.920
 and I'll define exactly what I mean by a little bit,

33:08.920 --> 33:13.920
 is the most important thing for adult learning,

33:14.320 --> 33:15.640
 as well as childhood learning,

33:15.640 --> 33:17.200
 but adult learning in particular.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.460
 Now, the Newton Lab did two very important

33:19.460 --> 33:21.160
 sets of experiments.

33:21.160 --> 33:24.640
 The first one was published in Nature,

33:24.640 --> 33:26.560
 very important study,

33:26.560 --> 33:31.020
 which showed that juveniles can make these massive shifts

33:31.020 --> 33:32.260
 in their map representations,

33:32.260 --> 33:35.400
 meaning you can shift the visual world using visual prisms

33:35.400 --> 33:36.560
 a huge amount,

33:36.560 --> 33:39.460
 and very quickly young individuals

33:39.460 --> 33:41.860
 can shift their representations of the world

33:41.860 --> 33:44.120
 so that they learn to reach to the correct location.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.520
 They get a lot of plasticity all at once,

33:47.520 --> 33:48.600
 and it happens very fast

33:48.600 --> 33:51.320
 in the period of just a couple of days.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.160
 In adults, it tends to be very slow,

33:54.160 --> 33:56.760
 and most individuals never actually accomplish

33:56.760 --> 33:58.840
 the full map shift.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.400
 They don't get the plasticity.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.720
 And here, we're talking about map shifts,

34:01.720 --> 34:04.640
 but this could be learning a new language.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.080
 This could be any number of different things

34:06.080 --> 34:07.320
 that one were attempting.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.540
 So what we're saying is what I already said before,

34:09.540 --> 34:11.720
 which is that we learn very well as youngsters,

34:11.720 --> 34:14.520
 but not as adults after 25.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.360
 But then what they did

34:17.360 --> 34:20.680
 is they started making the increment of change smaller.

34:20.680 --> 34:24.520
 So instead of shifting the world a huge amount

34:24.520 --> 34:27.760
 by putting prisms that shifted the visual world

34:27.760 --> 34:29.360
 all the way over to the right,

34:29.360 --> 34:30.760
 they did this incrementally.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.240
 So first, they put on prisms

34:32.240 --> 34:34.300
 that shifted it just a little bit,

34:34.300 --> 34:37.040
 just like seven degrees, I believe was the exact number.

34:37.040 --> 34:40.240
 And then it was 14 degrees, and then it was 28 degrees.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.960
 And so what they found was that the adult nervous system

34:42.960 --> 34:47.200
 can tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time,

34:47.200 --> 34:49.580
 but that you can stack those errors

34:49.580 --> 34:51.240
 so that you can get a lot of plasticity.

34:51.240 --> 34:54.480
 Put simply, incremental learning as an adult

34:54.480 --> 34:55.760
 is absolutely essential.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.920
 You are not gonna get massive shifts

34:57.920 --> 35:00.120
 in your representations of the outside world.

35:00.120 --> 35:03.560
 So how do you make small errors as opposed to big errors?

35:03.560 --> 35:08.560
 Well, the key is smaller bouts of focused learning

35:09.120 --> 35:12.160
 for smaller bits of information.

35:13.020 --> 35:17.080
 It's a mistake to try and learn a lot of information

35:17.080 --> 35:19.560
 in one learning bout as an adult.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.980
 What these papers from the Knudsen Lab show

35:21.980 --> 35:24.160
 and what others have gone on to show

35:24.160 --> 35:26.560
 is that the adult nervous system is fully capable

35:26.560 --> 35:30.320
 of engaging in a huge amount of plasticity,

35:30.320 --> 35:32.460
 but you need to do it in smaller increments

35:32.460 --> 35:35.920
 per learning epoch or per learning episode.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.840
 So how would you do this?

35:36.840 --> 35:39.920
 Well, let's say, for instance, I'm terrible at free throws.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.600
 So let's say I wanted to learn free throws.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.540
 I'm 45 years old, so I'm well past the 25 and under mark.

35:47.540 --> 35:50.600
 I'm gonna make errors, I'm gonna make a lot of errors.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.560
 If I go into learning free throws,

35:53.560 --> 35:58.560
 knowing that errors are the gate to plasticity,

35:59.400 --> 36:00.840
 well, then I feel a little bit better,

36:00.840 --> 36:03.400
 but I still have to aim for the rim of the basket

36:03.400 --> 36:07.400
 or the net, basically showing how little

36:07.400 --> 36:08.380
 I know about basketball.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.640
 But I think I know the general themes around basketball.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.520
 It involves a net, a backboard, and a ball, of course.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.820
 So I go to the free throw line and I'll throw.

36:15.820 --> 36:16.720
 How long should I go?

36:16.720 --> 36:19.380
 Well, until I'm hitting the point of frustration,

36:19.380 --> 36:24.380
 and at that point, continuing probably for anywhere

36:24.480 --> 36:28.860
 from 10 to 100 more trials should be my limit, right?

36:28.860 --> 36:31.500
 That should be my limit if I want to improve

36:31.500 --> 36:34.020
 some specific aspect of the motor behavior.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.020
 And so the question then is,

36:36.020 --> 36:37.620
 what should I be paying attention to?

36:37.620 --> 36:38.640
 What should I be focusing on?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.840
 Well, obviously trying to get the ball into the basket,

36:40.840 --> 36:43.580
 but the beauty of motor learning is that the circuits

36:43.580 --> 36:46.140
 for auditory and visual and motor

36:46.140 --> 36:48.060
 more or less teach themselves.

36:48.060 --> 36:50.340
 I don't necessarily have to be paying attention

36:50.340 --> 36:55.340
 to exactly what the contact of my fingers with the ball

36:55.660 --> 36:57.060
 or some random feature,

36:57.060 --> 36:59.140
 like whether or not I'm bending my knees or not.

36:59.140 --> 37:02.220
 The key is to try a number of different parameters

37:02.220 --> 37:04.680
 until I start to approximate the behavior

37:04.680 --> 37:06.260
 that I want to get a little bit better

37:06.260 --> 37:08.620
 and then trying to get consistent about that.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.780
 Now, many of you involved in sports learning will say,

37:10.780 --> 37:13.380
 okay, well, that's obvious, it's just incremental learning.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.820
 But the key thing is in those errors.

37:15.820 --> 37:19.880
 By isolating the errors and making a number of errors

37:19.880 --> 37:22.080
 in a particular aspect of the motor movement,

37:22.080 --> 37:24.200
 it signals to the brain that it's plastic.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.420
 And if I leave that episode of going

37:27.420 --> 37:30.020
 and trying to learn how to shoot free throws,

37:30.020 --> 37:31.620
 my brain is still plastic.

37:31.620 --> 37:34.900
 Plasticity is a state of the brain and nervous system.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.120
 It's not just geared toward the specific thing

37:37.120 --> 37:38.340
 I'm trying to learn.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.180
 So there are two aspects to plasticity

37:40.180 --> 37:41.420
 that I think we really need to highlight.

37:41.420 --> 37:44.700
 One is that there's plasticity geared toward the thing

37:44.700 --> 37:46.780
 that you are trying to learn specifically.

37:46.780 --> 37:48.880
 And then there are states of mind and body

37:48.880 --> 37:51.700
 that allow us to access plasticity.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.120
 Now, toward the end of this episode,

37:53.120 --> 37:54.820
 I'm going to spell out specific protocols

37:54.820 --> 37:55.780
 in a little more detail.

37:55.780 --> 37:59.300
 That free throw example might not correlate

37:59.300 --> 38:00.720
 with what you want to learn.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.780
 Actually, I don't have a huge desire to learn free throws.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.060
 I've more or less given up on basketball

38:06.020 --> 38:07.560
 and free throws in particular.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.300
 But I think that it's important to understand

38:10.300 --> 38:13.480
 that motor movements are the most straightforward way

38:13.480 --> 38:15.420
 to access states of plasticity.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.640
 And that can be for sake of learning the motor movement

38:17.640 --> 38:20.340
 or for sake of accessing plasticity more generally.

38:21.200 --> 38:26.200
 One very important aspect to getting plasticity as an adult

38:27.200 --> 38:30.620
 is not just smaller increments, meaning shorter bouts.

38:30.620 --> 38:33.480
 So I gave an example of another 100 free throws or something

38:33.480 --> 38:37.000
 but going out there and just getting my 10,000 free throws

38:37.000 --> 38:41.280
 all at once or packing as much as I can into one episode

38:41.280 --> 38:43.480
 is not going to be as efficient for me

38:43.480 --> 38:47.720
 as shorter bouts of intense learning as an adult.

38:47.720 --> 38:51.200
 Because the error signals are not as well defined.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.040
 To my nervous system,

38:52.040 --> 38:54.340
 it's not going to know what needs to change.

38:54.340 --> 38:55.940
 And so this is really the key element

38:55.940 --> 38:57.220
 of incremental learning,

38:57.220 --> 38:59.160
 is that you're trying to signal to the nervous system

38:59.160 --> 39:01.100
 at least one component that needs to change.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.040
 The nervous system needs to know what the error is.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.840
 Now, when I shoot free throws, Lord knows,

39:06.840 --> 39:08.640
 there are a lot of different kinds of errors that happen.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.000
 Probably the way I'm bending my knees, the arc of the ball,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.400
 the way I'm organizing my shoulder

39:12.400 --> 39:15.120
 is probably where my eyes are, lots of things.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.160
 So which ones to focus on.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.220
 And that's what I said before,

39:18.220 --> 39:19.680
 the beauty of the motor system is

39:19.680 --> 39:21.840
 I don't have to worry about all of that.

39:21.840 --> 39:25.400
 I just need to get the reps in a number of times

39:25.400 --> 39:27.360
 and the nervous system will figure out

39:27.360 --> 39:30.460
 how far off my motor commands are

39:30.460 --> 39:32.800
 at the level of these maps that I described earlier,

39:32.800 --> 39:37.800
 how far those deviate from the desired behavior,

39:37.960 --> 39:40.120
 getting the ball into the basket.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.540
 And it will start making adjustments.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.020
 But as I make adjustments,

39:45.020 --> 39:47.280
 or as my nervous system makes adjustments for me,

39:47.280 --> 39:51.040
 the key thing is to not start adding a variety of new errors

39:51.040 --> 39:52.200
 because then it gets confused.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.260
 And so this is why short learning bouts

39:54.260 --> 39:55.880
 are absolutely essential.

39:55.880 --> 39:59.040
 So let's say it's for learning an instrument as an adult,

39:59.040 --> 40:04.040
 probably anywhere from seven minutes to 30 minutes

40:05.440 --> 40:09.240
 provided that you're fully attending, you're very focused,

40:09.240 --> 40:12.760
 is going to be a pretty significant stimulus

40:12.760 --> 40:15.320
 to inspire plasticity in the nervous system.

40:15.320 --> 40:19.000
 Now, there is one way to get a lot of plasticity

40:19.000 --> 40:20.160
 all at once as an adult.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.420
 There is that kind of holy grail thing

40:22.420 --> 40:26.360
 of getting massive plasticity

40:26.360 --> 40:31.320
 as you would when you were a young person, but as an adult.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.760
 And the Knudsen lab revealed this

40:34.760 --> 40:39.760
 by setting a very serious contingency on the learning.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.400
 What they did was they had a situation

40:42.400 --> 40:46.280
 where subjects had to find food

40:46.280 --> 40:48.080
 that was displaced in their visual world,

40:48.080 --> 40:49.640
 again, by putting prisms,

40:49.640 --> 40:52.680
 and they had to find the food and the food made a noise.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.680
 There was a noise set kind of the location of the food

40:54.680 --> 40:56.640
 through an array of speakers.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.760
 Basically, what they found was that

40:58.760 --> 41:01.240
 if people have to adjust their visual world

41:01.240 --> 41:04.360
 in order to get food, the plasticity would eventually occur,

41:04.360 --> 41:06.800
 but it was very slow as an adult.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.960
 It was very, very slow.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.700
 Unless they actually had to hunt that food.

41:12.700 --> 41:17.240
 They actually, in order to eat at all,

41:17.240 --> 41:18.960
 they needed plasticity.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.380
 And then what happened was remarkable.

41:21.380 --> 41:24.900
 What they observed is that the plasticity as an adult

41:24.900 --> 41:29.820
 can be as dramatic, as robust as it is in a young person

41:29.820 --> 41:32.260
 or in a young animal subject,

41:32.260 --> 41:35.000
 provided that there's a serious incentive

41:35.000 --> 41:37.200
 for the plasticity to occur.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.400
 And this is absolutely important to understand,

41:39.400 --> 41:44.120
 which is that how badly we need or want the plasticity

41:44.120 --> 41:47.760
 determines how fast that plasticity will arrive,

41:47.760 --> 41:51.280
 which is incredible because the brain is just neurons

41:51.280 --> 41:52.540
 and soup of chemicals.

41:52.540 --> 41:55.640
 So with this, but this means that the importance of something

41:55.640 --> 41:57.480
 how important something is to us

41:57.480 --> 41:59.800
 actually gates the rate of plasticity

41:59.800 --> 42:01.880
 and the magnitude of plasticity.

42:01.880 --> 42:06.240
 And this is why just passively going through most things,

42:06.240 --> 42:07.880
 going through the motions, as we say,

42:07.880 --> 42:10.720
 or just getting our reps in quote unquote

42:10.720 --> 42:14.880
 is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.320
 This study, a beautiful study

42:18.200 --> 42:20.820
 published in the Journal of Neuroscience shows

42:20.820 --> 42:24.800
 that if we actually have to accomplish something

42:24.800 --> 42:29.800
 in order to eat or in order to get our ration of income,

42:29.800 --> 42:33.180
 we will reshape our nervous system very, very quickly.

42:33.180 --> 42:37.680
 So the nervous system has a capacity to change

42:37.680 --> 42:40.780
 at a tremendous rate to an enormous degree

42:40.780 --> 42:43.540
 at any stage of life,

42:43.540 --> 42:46.860
 provided it's important enough that that happened.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.380
 And I think some of you might be saying,

42:48.380 --> 42:49.740
 well, duh, that's obvious.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.140
 If it's really crucial,

42:51.140 --> 42:53.240
 then of course it's gonna change faster,

42:53.240 --> 42:55.020
 but it didn't have to be that way.

42:55.020 --> 42:57.020
 And for most people who are trying to learn

42:57.020 --> 43:00.300
 how to learn faster or learn better,

43:00.300 --> 43:04.260
 they probably, in most cases,

43:04.260 --> 43:07.100
 they are hitting a limit

43:07.100 --> 43:11.820
 because the need to change is not crucial enough.

43:11.820 --> 43:13.640
 And I think there are a number of places

43:13.640 --> 43:15.260
 where this has an important relevance

43:15.260 --> 43:19.620
 in the people who are battling addiction, for instance.

43:19.620 --> 43:22.420
 I will be the first to say that I sympathize with the fact

43:22.420 --> 43:24.880
 that addictions have a biological component.

43:24.880 --> 43:29.080
 There's clearly cases where people struggle tremendously

43:29.080 --> 43:31.160
 to change their behavior and their nervous system,

43:31.160 --> 43:32.980
 in some cases, is so disrupted

43:32.980 --> 43:35.100
 by whatever substance they've been abusing

43:35.100 --> 43:36.960
 or behavior that they've been engaging in

43:36.960 --> 43:39.540
 that it's that much harder for them to change.

43:39.540 --> 43:42.080
 But we've also seen incredible examples

43:42.080 --> 43:46.600
 where when people have to change from an internal standpoint

43:46.600 --> 43:49.640
 from their own belief and desire to change,

43:49.640 --> 43:52.120
 that massive change is possible.

43:52.120 --> 43:55.140
 And so I think that the studies that Knudsen did

43:55.140 --> 43:56.980
 showing that incremental learning

43:56.980 --> 44:00.460
 can create a huge degree of plasticity as an adult,

44:00.460 --> 44:04.400
 as well as when the contingency is very high,

44:04.400 --> 44:07.340
 meaning we need to eat or we need to make an income

44:07.340 --> 44:10.980
 or we need to do something that's vitally important for us,

44:10.980 --> 44:15.240
 that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps

44:15.240 --> 44:19.120
 just like they can in adolescence and young adulthood.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.160
 That points to the fact

44:20.160 --> 44:22.840
 that it has to be a neurochemical system.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.680
 There has to be an underlying mechanism, right?

44:25.680 --> 44:28.480
 This wasn't a case of sticking a wire into the brain

44:28.480 --> 44:30.240
 or taking a particular drug.

44:30.240 --> 44:33.120
 All the chemicals that we're about to talk about

44:33.120 --> 44:36.400
 are released from drug stores, if you will,

44:36.400 --> 44:39.840
 chemical stores that already reside in all of our brains.

44:39.840 --> 44:43.240
 And the key is how to tap into those stores.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.120
 And so we're going to next talk about

44:45.120 --> 44:47.320
 what are the specific behaviors

44:47.320 --> 44:51.460
 that liberate particular categories of chemicals

44:51.460 --> 44:54.520
 that allow us to make the most of incremental learning

44:54.520 --> 44:57.800
 and that set the stage for plasticity

44:57.800 --> 44:59.680
 that is similar enough

44:59.680 --> 45:02.640
 or mimics these high contingency states

45:02.640 --> 45:03.900
 like the need to get food

45:03.900 --> 45:06.920
 or really create a sense of internal urgency,

45:06.920 --> 45:08.980
 chemical urgency, if you will.

45:08.980 --> 45:12.160
 If you've heard previous episodes of this podcast,

45:12.160 --> 45:14.120
 you may have heard me talk about ultradian rhythms,

45:14.120 --> 45:16.780
 which are these 90 minute rhythms

45:16.780 --> 45:20.240
 that break up our 24 hour day.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.580
 They help break up our sleep into different cycles of sleep

45:23.580 --> 45:25.200
 like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.040
 And in waking states, they help us,

45:27.920 --> 45:31.000
 or I should say they break up our day in ways

45:31.000 --> 45:32.600
 that allow us to learn best

45:32.600 --> 45:34.540
 within 90 minute cycles, et cetera.

45:34.540 --> 45:35.560
 So some of you might be saying,

45:35.560 --> 45:37.360
 wait, you've been talking about ultradian cycles

45:37.360 --> 45:39.000
 and a moment ago you were talking about

45:39.000 --> 45:42.080
 seven minute or 12 minute or 30 minute learning cycles.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.360
 Today we're really talking about

45:43.360 --> 45:46.080
 how to tap into plasticity

45:46.080 --> 45:49.340
 through the completion of a task

45:49.340 --> 45:53.520
 or working towards something repetitively and making errors.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.000
 And so just to frame this

45:56.000 --> 45:58.460
 in the context of the ultradian cycle,

45:58.460 --> 45:59.880
 you might sit down,

45:59.880 --> 46:04.080
 decide that you're going to learn a conversational French,

46:04.080 --> 46:05.160
 which would mean that you probably

46:05.160 --> 46:06.560
 don't already speak French.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.860
 So you're going to sit down,

46:07.860 --> 46:09.140
 you're going to decide,

46:09.140 --> 46:11.520
 you're going to learn some nouns and some verbs.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.040
 You might do some practice sets.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.560
 The ultradian cycle says that

46:14.560 --> 46:17.880
 for the first five to 10 minutes of doing that,

46:17.880 --> 46:19.220
 your mind is going to drift

46:19.220 --> 46:21.300
 and your focus will probably kick in

46:21.300 --> 46:24.880
 provided that you're restricting your visual world

46:24.880 --> 46:26.720
 to just the material in front of you,

46:26.720 --> 46:28.840
 something we talked about last episode,

46:28.840 --> 46:31.000
 somewhere around the 10 or 15 minute mark.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.280
 And then at best,

46:32.280 --> 46:33.940
 you're probably going to get about an hour

46:33.940 --> 46:38.400
 of deliberate kind of tunnel vision learning in there.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.880
 Your mind will drift.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.160
 And then toward the end of that,

46:42.160 --> 46:45.460
 what is now an hour and 10 or hour and 20 minute cycle,

46:45.460 --> 46:46.300
 you're going to,

46:46.300 --> 46:48.440
 your brain will start to flicker in and out.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.240
 You might start thinking about what you need to eat

46:50.240 --> 46:52.020
 or the fact that you have to use the bathroom or something.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.200
 And then by the 90 minutes,

46:53.200 --> 46:55.040
 it's probably time to just stop the learning bout

46:55.040 --> 46:56.720
 and go do something else,

46:56.720 --> 46:59.300
 maybe return for a second learning bout later,

46:59.300 --> 47:01.760
 but maybe take a nap afterwards

47:01.760 --> 47:03.200
 or something to enhance the learning,

47:03.200 --> 47:05.640
 but that it's going to happen within

47:05.640 --> 47:06.760
 about a 90 minute block,

47:06.760 --> 47:09.440
 you're going to go through that cycle of learning.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.760
 But when I refer to the seven or 12 or 30 minutes

47:12.760 --> 47:13.680
 of making errors,

47:13.680 --> 47:15.920
 what I mean is when you're really in a mode

47:15.920 --> 47:19.400
 of repeating errors, not deliberately,

47:19.400 --> 47:21.120
 you're trying your best to accomplish something

47:21.120 --> 47:22.440
 and you're failing.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.020
 You're absolutely failing.

47:24.020 --> 47:28.320
 You're trying to remember, say, the sign language alphabet.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.080
 I was trying to teach myself this recently,

47:30.080 --> 47:31.620
 and then I keep repeating and repeating,

47:31.620 --> 47:32.460
 and then you get to a certain point

47:32.460 --> 47:33.840
 where I kept making errors,

47:33.840 --> 47:35.920
 making errors, making errors.

47:35.920 --> 47:39.780
 You want to keep making errors for this period of time

47:39.780 --> 47:41.320
 that I'm saying will last anywhere

47:41.320 --> 47:42.640
 for about seven to 30 minutes.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.920
 It is exceedingly frustrating,

47:44.920 --> 47:48.860
 but that frustration, it liberates the chemical cues

47:48.860 --> 47:50.960
 that signal that plasticity needs to happen.

47:50.960 --> 47:55.260
 And they also signal the particular neurons that are active.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.160
 So in the case of sign language,

47:57.160 --> 47:59.040
 it might be the ones that control my hand movements

47:59.040 --> 48:02.160
 as well as me thinking about what the different letters are.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.800
 It's signaling different components within the networks

48:05.800 --> 48:07.520
 of between the brain and body.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.940
 And it's trying to figure out,

48:08.940 --> 48:10.860
 wait, where are these errors coming from?

48:10.860 --> 48:11.880
 Where are the errors coming from?

48:11.880 --> 48:13.540
 Ah, it's those neurons.

48:13.540 --> 48:14.840
 They're making the mistakes.

48:14.840 --> 48:15.800
 They're making the mistakes.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.180
 They're making the mistakes.

48:17.180 --> 48:21.580
 And it essentially highlights that pathway for change.

48:21.580 --> 48:24.280
 And it is the case that when we come back a day or two later

48:24.280 --> 48:26.760
 in a learning bout after a nap or a night or two

48:26.760 --> 48:29.400
 of deep rest, then what we find is that

48:29.400 --> 48:32.360
 we can remember certain things and the motor pathways work.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.800
 And we don't always get it perfectly,

48:33.800 --> 48:37.040
 but we get a lot of it right whereas we got it wrong before.

48:37.040 --> 48:41.440
 So that seven to 30 minute intense learning bout

48:41.440 --> 48:43.020
 is within the ultradian cycle.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.080
 And I want to be clear about that.

48:45.080 --> 48:47.440
 And some people can tolerate many of these per day.

48:47.440 --> 48:51.720
 Most people can only tolerate one or two, maybe three.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.920
 This is intense work.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.720
 If, you know, shooting free throws,

48:54.720 --> 48:55.880
 you could probably do it all day.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.100
 But what I'm talking about is really trying

48:58.100 --> 49:02.420
 to accelerate plasticity by having a period

49:02.420 --> 49:05.980
 of the seven to 30 minutes per learning bout

49:05.980 --> 49:10.400
 that is specifically about making errors.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.500
 I want to really underscore that.

49:12.500 --> 49:15.120
 And it's not about, as I mentioned before,

49:15.120 --> 49:16.920
 coming up with some little hack or trick

49:16.920 --> 49:19.720
 or something of that sort.

49:19.720 --> 49:22.640
 It's really about trying to cue the nervous system

49:22.640 --> 49:23.960
 that something needs to change

49:23.960 --> 49:26.560
 because otherwise it simply won't change.

49:26.560 --> 49:30.480
 Now, there's another aspect to learning.

49:30.480 --> 49:31.720
 I think it's only fair to mention,

49:31.720 --> 49:36.460
 which is that we can all learn very easily

49:36.460 --> 49:38.440
 when there's something very bad happens to us.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.020
 And I don't wish this on anyone,

49:41.020 --> 49:43.440
 but it is the case that if something really terrible happens

49:43.440 --> 49:47.300
 that we will have a lifetime memory for that event.

49:47.300 --> 49:50.160
 There are processes that allow us to uncouple

49:50.160 --> 49:51.600
 the emotional load of that event.

49:51.600 --> 49:55.040
 I talked about some of those a few episodes back,

49:55.040 --> 49:57.640
 the episode on dreams, trauma, and hallucinations.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.640
 And we're going to return to trauma release, PTSD,

50:00.640 --> 50:03.000
 and some of those other themes in a future episode.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.860
 But the reason why negative experiences

50:06.860 --> 50:08.840
 can be wired into us so quickly

50:08.840 --> 50:12.280
 is because our nervous system's main job is to keep us safe.

50:12.280 --> 50:15.920
 But at a deeper level, it's because negative experiences

50:15.920 --> 50:17.780
 cue us to the fact that whatever's happening

50:17.780 --> 50:19.120
 that's really bad is very different

50:19.120 --> 50:22.480
 than the other things that tend to happen before.

50:22.480 --> 50:25.180
 So most of our experience doesn't remap us,

50:25.180 --> 50:26.960
 but those negative experiences

50:26.960 --> 50:29.240
 deploy high levels of norepinephrine,

50:29.240 --> 50:33.360
 high levels of acetylcholine, and really make,

50:33.360 --> 50:36.100
 so that whatever it is that we experience

50:36.100 --> 50:40.560
 in that bad episode is essentially cued up.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.120
 And so we're on the lookout for it.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.800
 And this has a number of negative effects,

50:43.800 --> 50:46.520
 but in terms of psychological and emotional effects,

50:46.520 --> 50:50.360
 but it is really a process designed to keep us safe.

50:50.360 --> 50:54.360
 The other ways in which we can learn more quickly

50:54.360 --> 50:56.120
 besides just making errors

50:56.120 --> 50:58.800
 is when something really surprises us.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.320
 And if we're positively surprised by something,

51:01.320 --> 51:04.340
 or we are just flooded with this molecule dopamine,

51:04.340 --> 51:08.200
 then there's a great opportunity for plasticity.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.400
 Dopamine is a molecule

51:09.400 --> 51:11.920
 that's almost always associated with pleasure

51:11.920 --> 51:14.200
 and with the accomplishment of a particular goal,

51:14.200 --> 51:17.640
 but it's really also a molecule of motivation.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.920
 It's a molecule that is released inside of us

51:19.920 --> 51:22.320
 when we think we're on the right path.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.920
 And it does have a capacity to increase neuroplasticity,

51:25.920 --> 51:29.320
 motivation, et cetera, it's released in response

51:29.320 --> 51:31.000
 to a number of natural behaviors,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.600
 just that help with the progression of ours

51:33.600 --> 51:37.540
 and other species, things like food, sex,

51:39.580 --> 51:41.200
 in some sense, social connection,

51:41.200 --> 51:42.720
 although that's more serotonin,

51:42.720 --> 51:46.880
 and serotonin doesn't have the same effects on plasticity,

51:46.880 --> 51:49.320
 quite the same, and we'll talk about a few later.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.940
 But dopamine is when we think we're on the right path

51:52.940 --> 51:56.400
 toward an external goal, a little bit is released,

51:56.400 --> 51:59.040
 and it tends to give us more motivation toward that goal.

51:59.040 --> 52:02.500
 I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning

52:02.500 --> 52:04.480
 by doing the following.

52:04.480 --> 52:07.900
 Learn to attach dopamine in a subjective way

52:07.900 --> 52:10.120
 to this process of making errors,

52:10.120 --> 52:13.480
 because that's really combining two modes of plasticity

52:13.480 --> 52:16.840
 in ways that together can accelerate the plasticity.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.780
 So earlier I talked about making errors

52:18.780 --> 52:21.540
 and having a focus bout of learning

52:21.540 --> 52:23.940
 that includes making a lot of errors

52:23.940 --> 52:25.380
 inside of that learning bout,

52:25.380 --> 52:26.880
 that is going to be frustrating,

52:26.880 --> 52:30.520
 but the frustration itself is the cue,

52:30.520 --> 52:33.960
 and epinephrine will be very high under those conditions,

52:33.960 --> 52:38.380
 but if you can just subjectively associate that experience

52:38.380 --> 52:40.800
 with something good and that you want to continue

52:40.800 --> 52:42.520
 down that path as opposed to quitting

52:42.520 --> 52:43.880
 when you hit the point of frustration,

52:43.880 --> 52:46.860
 well, then you now start to create a synergy

52:46.860 --> 52:48.520
 between the dopamine that's released

52:48.520 --> 52:50.800
 when we subjectively think something is good

52:50.800 --> 52:52.640
 or tell ourselves something is good,

52:52.640 --> 52:55.220
 and that situation of making failures.

52:55.220 --> 52:59.580
 In other words, making failing repetitively,

52:59.580 --> 53:02.000
 provided we're engaged in a very specific set of behaviors

53:02.000 --> 53:04.320
 when we do it, as well as telling ourselves

53:04.320 --> 53:07.680
 that those failures are good for learning and good for us,

53:07.680 --> 53:11.080
 creates an outsized effect on the rate of plasticity.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.380
 It accelerates plasticity.

53:13.380 --> 53:16.180
 Now, some of you might be asking, and I get asked a lot,

53:16.180 --> 53:18.480
 well, how do I get dopamine to be released?

53:18.480 --> 53:20.340
 Can I just tell myself that something is good

53:20.340 --> 53:21.180
 when it's bad?

53:21.180 --> 53:23.840
 Well, actually, yes, believe it or not.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.180
 The thing about dopamine is it's highly subjective.

53:26.180 --> 53:27.500
 What's funny to one person

53:27.500 --> 53:28.760
 is not necessarily funny to the next,

53:28.760 --> 53:32.900
 so it has to have some sense of authenticity for you,

53:32.900 --> 53:35.000
 but if you really want to be learning the thing

53:35.000 --> 53:36.460
 that you're trying to learn,

53:36.460 --> 53:38.880
 that should be reason enough to tell yourself,

53:38.880 --> 53:40.720
 well, I'm frustrated,

53:40.720 --> 53:44.560
 but the frustration is the source of accelerated learning.

53:44.560 --> 53:47.560
 Dopamine is one of these incredible molecules

53:47.560 --> 53:50.960
 that both can be released according to things

53:50.960 --> 53:53.640
 that are hardwired in us to release dopamine.

53:53.640 --> 53:57.280
 Again, things like food, sex, warmth when we're cold,

53:57.280 --> 53:59.220
 cool environments when we're too warm.

53:59.220 --> 54:03.040
 It's that kind of pleasure molecule overall,

54:03.040 --> 54:07.240
 but it's also highly subjective

54:07.240 --> 54:09.860
 what releases dopamine in one person versus the next.

54:09.860 --> 54:11.320
 So everyone releases dopamine

54:11.320 --> 54:14.120
 in response to those very basic kind of behaviors

54:14.120 --> 54:15.360
 and activities,

54:15.360 --> 54:18.340
 but dopamine is also released

54:18.340 --> 54:21.400
 according to what we subjectively believe is good for us,

54:21.400 --> 54:22.960
 and that's what's so powerful about it.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.520
 In fact, a book that I highly recommend

54:24.520 --> 54:26.220
 if you want to read more about dopamine

54:26.220 --> 54:27.800
 is a book that, frankly, I wish I had written.

54:27.800 --> 54:28.800
 It's such a wonderful book.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.480
 It's called The Molecule of More,

54:30.480 --> 54:32.440
 and it really talks about dopamine

54:32.440 --> 54:35.360
 not just as a molecule associated with reward,

54:35.360 --> 54:38.100
 but a molecule associated with motivation and pursuit

54:38.100 --> 54:41.560
 and just how subjectively controlled dopamine can be.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.040
 So make lots of errors.

54:44.040 --> 54:47.440
 Tell yourself that those errors are important and good

54:47.440 --> 54:48.920
 for your overall learning goals.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.600
 So learn to attach dopamine,

54:50.600 --> 54:53.860
 meaning release dopamine in your brain

54:53.860 --> 54:55.360
 when you start to make errors.

54:55.360 --> 54:58.480
 Keep the bouts of learning relatively short

54:58.480 --> 54:59.720
 if you're an adult.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.040
 Younger people can probably engage

55:02.040 --> 55:03.700
 in more bouts of learning,

55:03.700 --> 55:05.240
 and it's probably one of the reasons

55:05.240 --> 55:07.200
 why they learn so much faster.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.200
 They can just pack so much more information

55:09.200 --> 55:11.600
 into the brains and nervous systems compared to adults.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.160
 You know, it's a little bit like, I'll use the example

55:14.160 --> 55:15.760
 of performance-enhancing drugs.

55:15.760 --> 55:16.840
 You know, some of those drugs

55:16.840 --> 55:18.560
 probably do enhance performance

55:18.560 --> 55:21.500
 at the level of increasing red blood cell count, et cetera,

55:21.500 --> 55:23.440
 but a lot of what those drugs do

55:23.440 --> 55:26.180
 is they allow athletes to recover faster

55:26.180 --> 55:27.300
 so they can just train more.

55:27.300 --> 55:28.960
 They allow them to do more work.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.440
 And so being a child is a little bit

55:30.440 --> 55:33.600
 like being in a performance-enhanced brain milieu.

55:33.600 --> 55:37.960
 Their brains are kind of unnatural, healthy neurochemicals

55:37.960 --> 55:41.680
 that afford them a lot more learning should they pursue it.

55:41.680 --> 55:45.540
 So this goes back to my advice for young people early on.

55:45.540 --> 55:47.400
 If you're young, what should you do?

55:47.400 --> 55:48.520
 Learn as much as you can

55:48.520 --> 55:50.340
 about as many things as you possibly can.

55:50.340 --> 55:52.440
 And I suggest specializing in something.

55:52.440 --> 55:56.320
 I guess I'm not in a position to give anyone direct advice,

55:56.320 --> 56:00.760
 but I would say hopefully by about age 30,

56:00.760 --> 56:03.160
 hopefully younger, you have some sense of what excites you

56:03.160 --> 56:05.200
 and try and get really good at that thing

56:05.200 --> 56:08.080
 provided it serves the world for better.

56:09.480 --> 56:12.940
 But that's all I'll say in terms of parenting advice.

56:12.940 --> 56:16.880
 It's not my place, but maybe sometime I'll have an episode

56:16.880 --> 56:21.160
 completely devoted to sort of youth and learning in youth.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.960
 But once you're attaching dopamine

56:23.960 --> 56:26.520
 to this process of making errors,

56:26.520 --> 56:28.320
 then I start getting lots of questions

56:28.320 --> 56:30.000
 that really are the right questions,

56:30.000 --> 56:33.040
 which are, you know, how often should I do this?

56:33.040 --> 56:34.560
 And when should I be doing this?

56:34.560 --> 56:35.400
 And at what time?

56:35.400 --> 56:36.440
 Well, I've talked a little bit about this

56:36.440 --> 56:38.800
 in previous episodes, but as long as we're now

56:38.800 --> 56:41.640
 kind of into the nitty gritty of tools and application,

56:41.640 --> 56:44.200
 each of us have some natural times throughout the day

56:44.200 --> 56:47.640
 when we are going to be much better

56:47.640 --> 56:51.280
 at tolerating these errors and much more focused

56:51.280 --> 56:52.480
 on what it is that we're trying to do.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.440
 Last episode was about focus,

56:54.440 --> 56:57.920
 but chances are that you can't focus as well at 4 p.m.

56:57.920 --> 56:59.120
 as you can at 10 a.m.

56:59.120 --> 57:01.980
 It differs for everybody depending on when you're sleeping

57:01.980 --> 57:04.320
 and your kind of natural chemistry and rhythms.

57:04.320 --> 57:07.400
 But find the time or times of day

57:07.400 --> 57:10.960
 when you naturally have the highest mental acuity.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.720
 And that's really when you want to engage

57:12.720 --> 57:14.360
 in these learning bouts.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.600
 And then get to the point where you're making errors

57:16.600 --> 57:19.680
 and then keep making errors for seven to 30 minutes.

57:19.680 --> 57:22.320
 Just keep making those errors and drill through it.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.540
 And you're almost seeking frustration.

57:24.540 --> 57:26.520
 And if you can find some pleasure in the frustration,

57:26.520 --> 57:28.280
 yes, that is a state that exists.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.320
 You have created the optimal neurochemical milieu

57:31.320 --> 57:33.560
 for learning that thing.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.280
 But then here's the beauty of it.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.840
 You also created the optimal milieu

57:37.840 --> 57:40.720
 for learning other things afterward.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.320
 If you leave that bout of,

57:42.320 --> 57:43.760
 I give the example of free throws,

57:43.760 --> 57:44.900
 or maybe it's playing tennis,

57:44.900 --> 57:46.760
 or maybe it's some other skill,

57:47.640 --> 57:49.340
 and you sit down to read a book,

57:49.340 --> 57:51.860
 your brain is in a heightened state

57:51.860 --> 57:54.460
 to learn and retain the information.

57:54.460 --> 57:56.580
 Because those chemicals don't get released

57:56.580 --> 57:57.560
 and then shut down.

57:57.560 --> 57:58.960
 You're creating a whole milieu,

57:58.960 --> 58:01.440
 an environment of these chemicals.

58:01.440 --> 58:05.160
 And the tale of how long these chemicals stay

58:05.160 --> 58:07.240
 sloshing around in your brain has too many factors

58:07.240 --> 58:08.660
 for me to put a hard number on it.

58:08.660 --> 58:10.840
 It's going to depend on transporters and enzymes

58:10.840 --> 58:12.200
 and all sorts of things.

58:12.200 --> 58:15.320
 But at least for an hour or so, I would say,

58:15.320 --> 58:18.360
 you're going to be in a state of heightened learning

58:18.360 --> 58:21.520
 and the ability to learn, not just the motor patterns,

58:21.520 --> 58:24.000
 but cognitive information, language information.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.980
 Maybe you go to therapy right after that

58:25.980 --> 58:28.180
 and you work on something in a very deliberate way

58:28.180 --> 58:29.600
 that you're trying to work on.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.040
 Maybe you don't go to therapy.

58:31.040 --> 58:34.380
 Maybe you do something else that's important to you.

58:34.380 --> 58:37.960
 Again, there are just a variety of examples I could give.

58:37.960 --> 58:40.400
 There are a number of things that allow us

58:40.400 --> 58:44.160
 to powerfully access the states of error

58:44.160 --> 58:47.860
 that are kind of surprising, but also kind of fun.

58:47.860 --> 58:49.780
 And these aren't, again, these aren't gimmicks.

58:49.780 --> 58:52.960
 These tap into these basic mechanisms of plasticity.

58:52.960 --> 58:57.040
 And the three that I'd like to talk about next

58:57.040 --> 59:01.240
 are balance, meaning the vestibular system,

59:01.240 --> 59:05.960
 as well as the two sides of what I call limbic friction

59:05.960 --> 59:07.420
 or autonomic arousal.

59:07.420 --> 59:08.680
 And if none of that makes sense,

59:08.680 --> 59:11.680
 I'm going to put a fine point on each one of those

59:11.680 --> 59:13.740
 and what it is and why it works

59:13.740 --> 59:15.880
 for opening up neuroplasticity.

59:15.880 --> 59:18.160
 Let's talk about limbic friction.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.920
 Now, limbic friction is not a term

59:19.920 --> 59:21.580
 you're going to find in the textbooks.

59:21.580 --> 59:23.520
 So if any of my colleagues are listening,

59:23.520 --> 59:25.840
 I want to repeat limbic friction.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.980
 I realize it's not something you're going to find

59:27.980 --> 59:29.600
 in any of the textbooks.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.300
 But it is an important principle

59:32.300 --> 59:36.240
 that captures a lot of information that is in textbooks,

59:36.240 --> 59:38.300
 both neurobiology and psychology,

59:38.300 --> 59:41.260
 and it has some really important implications.

59:42.800 --> 59:46.680
 Limbic friction is my attempt to give a name to something

59:46.680 --> 59:50.440
 that is more nuanced and mechanistic than stress.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.900
 Because typically when we hear about stress,

59:52.900 --> 59:56.800
 we think of heartbeat going too fast, breathing too fast,

59:56.800 --> 59:59.080
 sweating, and not being in a state that we want.

59:59.080 --> 1:00:01.640
 We're too alert and we want to be more calm.

1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:03.960
 And indeed, that's one condition

1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:06.700
 in which we have limbic friction,

1:00:06.700 --> 1:00:10.420
 meaning our limbic system is taking control

1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:12.600
 of a number of different aspects of our autonomic

1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:15.160
 or automatic biology.

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:18.740
 And we are struggling to control that

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:20.220
 through what we call top-down mechanisms.

1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:23.040
 We're trying to calm down in order to reduce

1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:24.960
 that level of arousal.

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:25.980
 We're all familiar with this.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:27.580
 It's called the stress response.

1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:30.400
 However, there's another aspect of stress

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:33.800
 that's just as important, which is when we're tired

1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:36.600
 and we're fatigued and we need to engage,

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:38.720
 we need to be more alert than we are.

1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:40.720
 And so what I call limbic friction

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:42.680
 is really designed to describe the fact

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.160
 that when our autonomic nervous system

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:45.280
 isn't where we want it,

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:47.320
 meaning we're trying to be more alert

1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:49.180
 or we're trying to be less alert,

1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:51.100
 both of those feel stressful to people.

1:00:51.100 --> 1:00:53.720
 So the other way to put it is that the word stress

1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:55.440
 is not a very good word to describe

1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:57.160
 what most people experience as stressful

1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:59.920
 because it can either be being too tired

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:01.220
 or being too alert.

1:01:01.220 --> 1:01:02.620
 Now, why am I bringing this up

1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:04.040
 in the discussion about neuroplasticity?

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.560
 This is not a discussion about stress.

1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:07.280
 At some point, we will talk about stress

1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:09.640
 and tools to deal with stress.

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.680
 But the reason I'm bringing this up

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:15.280
 is that in order to access neuroplasticity,

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.580
 you need these components of focus.

1:01:17.580 --> 1:01:21.560
 You need the component of attaching subjective reward.

1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:23.380
 You need to make errors, all this stuff.

1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:25.780
 And a lot of people find it difficult

1:01:25.780 --> 1:01:30.160
 to just get into the overall state to access those things.

1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:31.860
 So now there's a series of gates

1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:34.280
 that people are having a hard time accessing.

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:36.960
 They're too tired and they can't focus, for instance.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:39.920
 Well, here's the beauty of it.

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:44.440
 If you are too alert, meaning you're too anxious

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:47.400
 and you want to calm down in order to learn better,

1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:49.020
 there are things that you can do.

1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:51.600
 The two that I've spoken about previously

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:52.640
 on various podcasts,

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.120
 and I'll just review them really quickly,

1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.700
 are the double inhale-exhale.

1:01:55.700 --> 1:01:57.060
 So inhaling twice through the nose

1:01:57.060 --> 1:01:58.580
 and exhaling once through the mouth.

1:01:58.580 --> 1:02:02.200
 This is not some yogic trick or some hack.

1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:04.040
 This is what's called a physiological psi.

1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:06.300
 It offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs.

1:02:06.300 --> 1:02:07.680
 It has a number of different effects.

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:08.940
 These were described in textbooks

1:02:08.940 --> 1:02:12.000
 and dating back to the 30s.

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.720
 And a number of laboratories have explored

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:16.160
 the neural circuitry underlying

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.100
 these so-called physiological psi.

1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:20.120
 That will calm you down faster than anything else

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:21.920
 that I'm aware of.

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:25.040
 The other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision.

1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:27.120
 When you use tunnel vision, you're very focused.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:30.040
 That epinephrine is released by dilating your field of gaze,

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.100
 so-called panoramic vision.

1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:32.940
 Great.

1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:36.520
 So now you can start to sort of move up and down

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:39.160
 this level of autonomic arousal.

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:42.640
 The key is you want to be in a state of arousal

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:44.080
 that's ideally matched to the thing

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:45.460
 that you're trying to perform or learn.

1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:47.100
 So if I'm really anxious

1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:48.960
 and I can't even pick up the basketball

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:51.260
 or I feel like I'm shaking or my muscles are too tight,

1:02:51.260 --> 1:02:52.720
 I don't have that kind of looseness.

1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:53.840
 Now when I move like that,

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:56.520
 it almost makes it look like I could throw a free throw,

1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:59.360
 but I miss 95% of the time,

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:02.160
 unless the basket is very, very low

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:03.480
 and I place it indirectly.

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:06.080
 But I guess that's not a free throw, is it?

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:09.960
 In any case, the point being that you want to be

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:12.380
 in a state of alertness, but calm.

1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:14.360
 And so you need to have ways to calm yourself down

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:16.380
 when you're too amped up.

1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:19.520
 But the other side of limbic friction is important too.

1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:22.600
 If you are too tired and you can't focus,

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:23.960
 well then it's going to be impossible

1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:26.840
 to even get to the starting line, so to speak,

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:28.720
 for engaging in neuroplasticity

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:30.500
 through incremental learning, et cetera.

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:31.900
 So in that case,

1:03:31.900 --> 1:03:34.160
 there are other methods that you can do to wake yourself up.

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:36.020
 The best thing you should do is get a good night's sleep,

1:03:36.020 --> 1:03:37.160
 but that's not always possible

1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:39.860
 or use a NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol.

1:03:39.860 --> 1:03:42.360
 But if you've already done those things

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:46.160
 or you're simply exhausted for whatever other reason,

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:49.540
 then there are other things that I often get asked about,

1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:52.500
 like sure, a cup of coffee or super oxygenation breathing,

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:54.500
 which means inhaling more than exhaling

1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:56.480
 on average in a breathing bout.

1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:59.000
 These are, now we're sort of getting toward the realm

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.440
 of like how you could trick your nervous system

1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:01.320
 into waking up.

1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:02.920
 And if you bring more oxygen in

1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:04.520
 by making your inhales deeper and longer,

1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:06.180
 you will become more alert.

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:08.240
 You'll start to actually deploy norepinephrine

1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:09.640
 if you breathe very fast.

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:12.520
 So there are things that you can do to move up or down

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.560
 this so-called autonomic arousal arc.

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.980
 And what you want to ask before you undergo

1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:21.160
 any learning bout is how much limbic friction

1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:22.080
 am I experiencing?

1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:24.800
 Am I too alert and I want to be calmer

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:26.920
 or am I too calm and too sleepy

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:27.960
 and I want to be more alert?

1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:30.940
 You're going to need to engage in behaviors

1:04:30.940 --> 1:04:33.920
 that bring you to the starting line in order to learn.

1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:37.000
 There are other things that you can do

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.440
 in order to then learn better and faster

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:41.800
 besides incremental learning

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:43.820
 and those center on the vestibular system.

1:04:43.820 --> 1:04:45.840
 And this may come as a surprise to some people,

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:49.360
 but probably not as a surprise to some of you

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:52.000
 whose professions or whose recreation

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.400
 involves a lot of motor activity

1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:56.760
 and sort of what we call high dimensional skill activity,

1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:58.320
 not just running or cycling

1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:00.280
 or very linear activities like weightlifting,

1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:01.960
 but things that involve inversions

1:05:01.960 --> 1:05:03.640
 and a lot of lateral movement,

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.640
 actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:09.640
 these kinds of things, gymnastics type stuff.

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:13.340
 Why the vestibular system to access neuroplasticity?

1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:16.820
 Well, we have a hardwired system for balance

1:05:16.820 --> 1:05:19.400
 and here's how it works in as simple terms

1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:20.960
 as I can possibly come up with.

1:05:22.300 --> 1:05:27.300
 As we move through space or even if we're stationary,

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:29.920
 there are really three main planes of movement.

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:31.560
 Now I realize some people are just listening to this

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.160
 so I'm going to do this for both the folks

1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:34.080
 that are just listening

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:36.200
 and for those of you that are watching on video.

1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:39.120
 So there are three main modes of movement

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.400
 and it turns out that your brain doesn't really know

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:43.080
 where your body is except when

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:45.100
 through that proprioceptive feedback.

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:49.160
 The main way it knows is through three planes of movement

1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:51.840
 that we call pitch, which is like nodding.

1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:54.740
 So if I nod like this, that's pitch.

1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:57.400
 Then there's yaw, which is side to side,

1:05:57.400 --> 1:05:59.480
 which is like shaking my head, no.

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:01.640
 And then there's roll from side to side,

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:05.640
 like when a puppy looks at you like, that kind of thing.

1:06:05.640 --> 1:06:08.480
 So pitch, yaw, and roll.

1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:09.800
 And the pilots out there will know

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:11.320
 exactly what I'm talking about.

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:15.880
 The brain knows the orientation and position

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.120
 of your body relative to gravity,

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:21.680
 depending on whether or not your brain and your head

1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:25.180
 actually is engaging more in pitch, yaw, or roll,

1:06:25.180 --> 1:06:26.120
 or some combination.

1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:28.000
 Because if I lean down like so,

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.160
 or like so, it's a combination of pitch, yaw, and roll.

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:32.980
 Now you might say like, what is going on here?

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:35.920
 Well, we have these little things in our inner ear

1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:37.580
 called the semicircular canals.

1:06:37.580 --> 1:06:39.640
 Just like our eyes have two main functions,

1:06:39.640 --> 1:06:41.400
 one is to see objects in space,

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:43.800
 and the other is to set our circadian clocks

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:45.080
 through subconscious mechanisms,

1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:48.000
 our ears have two main roles.

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.120
 One is to hear, right, to perceive sound waves

1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:54.160
 or take in sound waves for perception, so-called hearing.

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:56.600
 And the other is balance or vestibular function.

1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:59.160
 So sitting in our ears are these semicircular canals,

1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:02.160
 and they're these little tubes where these little stones,

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:03.480
 they're actually little bits of calcium,

1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:05.440
 roll back and forth like little marbles.

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:07.520
 When we roll this way, they roll this way.

1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:09.520
 When we pitch, when we go from side to side,

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:10.860
 there's some that sit flat like this,

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:14.120
 and they go like marbles inside of a hula hoop.

1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:15.120
 And then we have roll.

1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:17.240
 There's some that are kind of at 45 degrees to those,

1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.400
 and it's kind of pitch, yaw, and roll.

1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:20.700
 So yeah, okay, great.

1:07:20.700 --> 1:07:23.260
 That sends signals to the rest of our brain and body

1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:25.040
 that tell us how to compensate

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:27.680
 for shifts relative to gravity.

1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:28.520
 And I say, okay, wait,

1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:29.700
 I thought we were talking about plasticity,

1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:33.160
 but this is where it gets really, really cool.

1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:38.160
 Errors in vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:42.560
 meaning when we are off balance and we have to compensate

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:44.800
 by looking at, thinking about,

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:47.440
 or responding to the world differently,

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:50.080
 cause an area of our brain called the cerebellum,

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:51.420
 it actually means mini brain,

1:07:51.420 --> 1:07:52.980
 and it looks like a little mini brain

1:07:52.980 --> 1:07:56.360
 like tucked below our cortex in the back,

1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:58.360
 cause the cerebellum to signal

1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:00.420
 some of these deeper brain centers

1:08:00.420 --> 1:08:03.720
 that release dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.

1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:08.720
 And that's because these circuits in the inner ear,

1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:12.100
 et cetera, and the cerebellum,

1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:16.880
 they were designed to recalibrate our motor movements

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:19.560
 when our relationship to gravity changes,

1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:21.000
 something fundamental to survival.

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.880
 We can't afford to be falling down all the time

1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.160
 or missing things that we grabbed for,

1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:28.420
 or running in the wrong direction

1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:29.940
 when something is pursuing us.

1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:31.480
 These are hardwired circuits

1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:34.620
 that tap right into these chemical pathways.

1:08:34.620 --> 1:08:38.620
 And those chemical pathways are the gates to plasticity.

1:08:38.620 --> 1:08:40.800
 So I really want to spell this out clearly

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:43.280
 cause I've given a lot of information today.

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:45.160
 The first thing is how are you arriving

1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:47.040
 to the learning bout?

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:48.360
 You need to make sure your level

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.060
 of autonomic arousal is correct.

1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:54.120
 The ideal state is going to be clear, calm, and focused,

1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:56.620
 maybe a little bit more on the arousal level,

1:08:56.620 --> 1:08:58.300
 like heightened arousal.

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:00.080
 So understand limbic friction,

1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:01.420
 understand that you can be too tired,

1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:02.340
 in which case you're going to need

1:09:02.340 --> 1:09:03.920
 to get yourself a little more alert,

1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:06.480
 or you can be too alert

1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:09.220
 and you're going to need to get yourself calmer.

1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:11.240
 That gets you to the starting line.

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:12.480
 When you're at the starting line,

1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:13.920
 then you're going to go into a learning bout

1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:16.840
 and that's when you want to start making these errors, okay?

1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:20.160
 But what I'm saying is there's a layer in between

1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:24.800
 where if you are interested in using motor patterns

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:27.440
 as a way to open up plasticity for all kinds of learning,

1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:28.640
 not just motor learning,

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:34.920
 disrupting your vestibular motor relationship,

1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:37.840
 meaning, and I'll tell you how to do that in a moment,

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:41.280
 can deploy or release neurochemicals in the brain

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:43.480
 that place you into a state

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:47.000
 that makes you much better at learning

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.400
 and making errors much more pleasureful.

1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:52.200
 You're much more willing to do that.

1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:54.480
 Now, some of you are probably saying flow state, flow state.

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:57.120
 Okay, I have friends that work on flow states

1:09:57.120 --> 1:09:58.920
 and who are involved in flow states

1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:00.300
 and trying to figure out what they are.

1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:01.800
 I have great respect for those people.

1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:06.800
 So I want to tip my hat to them, very important work.

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:08.980
 But again, flow is an expression

1:10:08.980 --> 1:10:10.920
 of what you already know how to do.

1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:12.960
 It's not how you learn,

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.600
 it's how you express what you've already learned.

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.160
 So I want to be really clear about that.

1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:19.960
 It's been kind of presented as this super state

1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:21.660
 or highly desirable state,

1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:24.340
 but it's that we can all reach for.

1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:26.200
 That's the wrong rung to reach for

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:27.800
 until you already know how to do the things

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:30.920
 that I'm describing, in my opinion.

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.040
 So the vestibular system,

1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:35.040
 if you can engage the vestibular system

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:38.700
 and create some errors within the vestibular motor operations

1:10:38.700 --> 1:10:39.840
 that you're carrying out,

1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:41.400
 you create a neurochemical state

1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:43.880
 that then makes you very, very good

1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.460
 at learning very quickly.

1:10:45.460 --> 1:10:46.840
 Regardless of age.

1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:48.080
 So what would this look like?

1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:49.840
 Does this mean just doing inversions?

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.960
 Well, does this mean doing yoga?

1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:52.800
 Maybe.

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:56.620
 Does this mean taking corners faster on your road bike?

1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:57.560
 Does this mean,

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:00.700
 let's say you always swim freestyle or breaststroke?

1:11:00.700 --> 1:11:05.700
 Does this mean swimming backstroke or butterfly?

1:11:05.980 --> 1:11:07.280
 It depends.

1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:08.560
 It depends, however,

1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:11.720
 on a very, very easy to understand parameter,

1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:14.020
 which is how regularly you perform

1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:15.560
 a particular motor behavior

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:18.800
 and how novel a behavior is.

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:21.340
 So the more novel that a behavior is

1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:23.880
 in terms of your relationship to gravity,

1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:27.520
 the more it will open up the opportunity for plasticity.

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:28.560
 Have you ever seen somebody

1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:31.520
 who just jumped out of the plane for the first time

1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:33.000
 with a parachute?

1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:35.020
 I don't even want to think about what,

1:11:35.020 --> 1:11:36.740
 if you've just seen somebody who jumped out of a plane

1:11:36.740 --> 1:11:38.020
 for the first time without a parachute,

1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:40.200
 I would just hope the plane was on the ground.

1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.080
 But if you've seen somebody after that,

1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:43.740
 they are in this incredible state

1:11:43.740 --> 1:11:45.480
 because their body and brain

1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:47.400
 are flooded with all these neurochemicals

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:49.040
 because it's very novel to them.

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:51.180
 However, I've got friends from communities

1:11:51.180 --> 1:11:53.960
 that have done thousands upon thousands,

1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:55.400
 maybe tens of thousands of jumps,

1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:57.280
 and they're always alert and aware,

1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:59.320
 but it becomes pretty regular for them.

1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:00.200
 That's the point.

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:02.160
 And they're not in this kind of buzzed out,

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:05.520
 excited state afterwards because it's routine for them.

1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:08.000
 So the key is to bring novelty

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.440
 to the vestibular motor experience.

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:15.440
 The vestibular motor commands that you're performing.

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:16.900
 And how do you do that?

1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:20.640
 Well, it's all about your orientation relative to gravity.

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:22.720
 Now, I wouldn't want anyone to place themselves at risk.

1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:24.920
 So if you can't do handstands,

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:27.800
 don't try and do them, freestanding and whatever.

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:29.000
 If you're good at handstands,

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.160
 guess how much plasticity doing a handstands

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:33.840
 for half an hour is going to create for you?

1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:35.280
 Zero.

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:36.120
 Zero.

1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:38.600
 Your body is fully comfortable walking on your hands.

1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.560
 I see these people walking on your hands,

1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:42.120
 being upside down, being inverted.

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:43.640
 Your Cirque du Soleil performers,

1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:44.780
 they're very comfortable there.

1:12:44.780 --> 1:12:47.320
 And there's zero learning, zero plasticity

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.960
 because the failures and errors

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:51.400
 and the relationship to gravity

1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:54.840
 are very typical for that individual.

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:56.560
 Now, what this means is

1:12:56.560 --> 1:12:58.640
 that if we're going to use motor practices

1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:00.520
 to open up plasticity for learning,

1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:01.700
 not just those practices,

1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:04.160
 but maybe some cognitive skills

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.600
 or other things in the period that follows,

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:09.680
 we need to create a sense of novelty relative to gravity.

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:13.400
 And that means being either in a new position

1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:15.320
 or slightly unstable.

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:18.280
 Believe it or not, I don't want anyone injuring themselves,

1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.960
 but the sensation of falling or close to falling

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:24.940
 signals the cerebellum to signal the deep brain centers

1:13:24.940 --> 1:13:26.780
 that release these neurochemicals

1:13:26.780 --> 1:13:28.120
 that something is very different

1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:31.080
 and we need to correct this error very, very fast.

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:33.640
 Earlier, I was talking about high contingencies

1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:37.020
 for learning and you definitely don't want to make it

1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:40.760
 to kind of like either survive this or die kind of experience

1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:44.300
 I confess I occasionally look at these parkour videos

1:13:44.300 --> 1:13:46.360
 on YouTube and believe it or not,

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:48.280
 a lot of those people have died.

1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:50.720
 The ones that do these ridiculous things

1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:52.220
 of hanging off of buildings and things,

1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:54.880
 I am not suggesting you do that, please don't do that.

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:56.840
 What I'm talking about is finding safe ways

1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:01.560
 to explore the sensory motor vestibular space as we call it,

1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:03.040
 the relationship between those things.

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:04.480
 So that could be through yoga.

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:05.600
 If you're terrible at yoga,

1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:07.040
 there's more opportunity for you to learn

1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:09.440
 than somebody who's very skilled at yoga, for instance,

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:12.280
 or gymnastics or handstands or on your road bike.

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:15.040
 This is unfortunately what I don't want to name brands,

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:16.560
 but stationary bikes where they give you

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:18.600
 the visual experience of moving through space,

1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:20.740
 but you're not actually moving through physical space.

1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:25.520
 There's no vestibular feedback, it's all visual, right?

1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:27.620
 You're stationary on the bike, right?

1:14:27.620 --> 1:14:29.760
 So unless you're hanging off the bike in your living room,

1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:32.020
 like almost to the point you're tipping the bike,

1:14:32.020 --> 1:14:35.160
 you're not getting the actual vestibular motor

1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:36.300
 sensory mismatch.

1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:38.680
 That mismatch is the signal that deploys

1:14:38.680 --> 1:14:40.460
 dopamine epinephrine and these other things.

1:14:40.460 --> 1:14:42.880
 I don't care how excited or how much fun the ride was

1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:45.160
 or how much music you're playing that you love,

1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:48.720
 it's not the same situation as being

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:53.720
 out of your normal relationship to the gravitational pull.

1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:57.320
 So the first gate is to arrive at learning

1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.600
 at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal.

1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:02.280
 Clear and focused is best,

1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:04.460
 but don't obsess over being right there.

1:15:04.460 --> 1:15:07.680
 It's okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired.

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:09.600
 Then you want to make errors.

1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:10.700
 We talked about that.

1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:13.600
 And this vestibular motor sensory relationship

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:17.040
 is absolutely key if you want to get heightened

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:18.840
 or accelerated plasticity.

1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:21.380
 And we talked about another feature,

1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:23.400
 which is setting a contingency.

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:26.160
 If there's a reason, an important reason for you

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:28.860
 to actually learn, even if you're making failures,

1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:30.680
 the learning will be accelerated.

1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:32.220
 So there's really four things

1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:36.020
 that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult.

1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:39.680
 And I would say that these also apply to young people.

1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:42.080
 And there's an interesting

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:44.060
 kind of a thought experiment there as well,

1:15:44.060 --> 1:15:46.820
 which is if you look at children,

1:15:46.820 --> 1:15:49.840
 they are moving a lot in different dimensions.

1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:52.400
 They are sometimes hanging from trees

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:55.100
 or I was a kind of a,

1:15:55.100 --> 1:15:56.280
 my sports were always things

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:58.240
 where I tended to get hurt a lot, fall a lot.

1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:00.120
 So there's a skateboarding for me when I was younger.

1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:01.740
 So a lot of falling and rolling

1:16:01.740 --> 1:16:05.040
 and various things of that sort,

1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:06.760
 but whatever sport the kids are playing,

1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:08.760
 or even if they don't play a sport,

1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:11.880
 they tend to move in a lot of different relationships

1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:15.040
 to gravity, more dimensionality to their movements,

1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:16.480
 I should say, than adults.

1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:18.480
 And one of the questions that's always kind of been

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:20.800
 in the back of my mind is,

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:23.880
 as we age, we get less good at engaging in neuroplasticity.

1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:26.540
 Part of that is because as the brain ages,

1:16:26.540 --> 1:16:28.780
 there are certain changes to the way

1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:29.920
 that neurons are structured,

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:31.920
 their molecular components, et cetera,

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:35.440
 but it's kind of a self-amplifying,

1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:40.440
 or I should say, a self-degenerating,

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:44.520
 self-degenerating cycle where as we get older,

1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:47.800
 we tend to get more linear and more regular

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:49.200
 about the specific kinds of movement.

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:51.400
 So we get on the treadmill or we take the walk,

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:53.560
 or we just always go up the same stairs, et cetera,

1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:56.500
 and there's less opportunity typically

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.400
 for engaging these relationships

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.300
 to the gravitational pull

1:17:00.300 --> 1:17:03.160
 through the vestibular motor sensory convergence

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:05.040
 that we talked about a moment ago.

1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:06.760
 And so you sort of have to wonder

1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:08.560
 whether or not the lack of plasticity

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.960
 or the reduced plasticity in older individuals,

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:16.320
 which includes me, would reflect the fact

1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:18.280
 that those chemicals aren't being deployed

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:21.740
 because we're not engaging in certain behaviors,

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:24.200
 as opposed to we can't engage in the behaviors

1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:26.040
 because the chemicals aren't being deployed.

1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:27.280
 Now, I have a feeling it's both.

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:29.240
 These have a reciprocal relationship.

1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:32.840
 And I certainly, again, I don't think it would be wise

1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:36.200
 for anyone who doesn't have the muscle stabilizing skills

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:38.600
 or the bone density, et cetera,

1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:41.160
 to start doing inversions and things of that sort.

1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:43.160
 That's not what I'm talking about here.

1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:44.560
 But it's interesting to think about

1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:46.600
 the sorts of exercise that we engage in.

1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:48.400
 We all know that getting the heart rate elevated

1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:50.940
 three to five times a week is really good for us,

1:17:50.940 --> 1:17:52.160
 for cardiovascular health.

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:54.780
 I think there's a ton of data to support that now.

1:17:54.780 --> 1:17:57.260
 Some load-bearing exercise is important

1:17:57.260 --> 1:17:58.520
 for increasing bone density

1:17:58.520 --> 1:17:59.840
 and maintaining muscular strength

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:02.000
 and proprioceptive feedback,

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.280
 because I'm sure many of you know this,

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:07.440
 but resistance exercise actually trains

1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:09.160
 the nerve to muscle connections

1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:11.640
 as much as it does the muscles themselves,

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:14.160
 something I talked about at the beginning of the episode.

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:19.160
 But I think most of us could stand to increase the degree

1:18:19.220 --> 1:18:22.880
 to which we engage this vestibular system in novel ways.

1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:24.340
 And that can be done quite safely

1:18:24.340 --> 1:18:27.200
 through a number of different mechanisms.

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:28.160
 I'm not a surfer,

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:29.920
 but people who do that sort of thing

1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:32.400
 are very familiar with orienting their body differently

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.600
 according to the gravitational pull.

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:36.040
 They're lying down, then they're standing up,

1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:37.840
 then they're turning, they're leaning their head.

1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:40.400
 So again, it's this pitch, yaw, roll thing.

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:42.640
 And again, if you're very skilled at surfing,

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:44.820
 you're actually not going to open up plasticity

1:18:44.820 --> 1:18:45.660
 just by surfing.

1:18:45.660 --> 1:18:49.700
 It's in the learning of these new relationships to gravity

1:18:49.700 --> 1:18:52.800
 that the windows for plasticity are enhanced.

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:56.480
 So I want to make sure that I underscore the fact

1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:59.040
 that this vestibular thing that I've been describing

1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:02.400
 is a way to really accentuate plasticity.

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:06.240
 It's tapping into an inborn biological mechanism

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:07.660
 where the cerebellum has outputs

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.080
 to these deep brain nuclei

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:12.520
 associated with dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.

1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:15.020
 You don't want to endanger yourself

1:19:15.020 --> 1:19:16.940
 in the course of pursuing these activities,

1:19:16.940 --> 1:19:18.820
 but it is a powerful mechanism.

1:19:18.820 --> 1:19:23.100
 That's kind of an amplifier on plasticity,

1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:24.440
 as is high contingency.

1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:26.540
 If you really need to learn conversational French

1:19:26.540 --> 1:19:28.100
 to save your relationship,

1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:29.820
 the chances are you're going to learn it.

1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:30.900
 There are limits, of course,

1:19:30.900 --> 1:19:33.640
 to the extent to which one can accentuate

1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.660
 or accelerate plasticity.

1:19:35.660 --> 1:19:37.860
 You know, the ceiling on this is not infinite.

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:40.020
 Although we don't know how high it goes,

1:19:40.020 --> 1:19:41.060
 I think it's reasonable to say

1:19:41.060 --> 1:19:42.740
 that if someone put a gun to my head and said,

1:19:42.740 --> 1:19:45.980
 learn conversational French in the next 120 seconds,

1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:47.860
 that conversational French would be limited

1:19:47.860 --> 1:19:49.300
 probably to just one word,

1:19:49.300 --> 1:19:51.620
 probably the word we or something like that,

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:55.380
 because I can't stuff in all the knowledge all at once.

1:19:55.380 --> 1:19:57.780
 I mean, I think that's the dream of brain machine interface

1:19:57.780 --> 1:19:59.580
 that one will be able to download a chip

1:19:59.580 --> 1:20:01.740
 into their hippocampus or cortex

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:02.860
 or some other brain structure

1:20:02.860 --> 1:20:06.060
 that would allow them to download conversational French.

1:20:06.060 --> 1:20:08.940
 And someday we may get to that

1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:11.040
 as that capability may come about.

1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:13.100
 Right now, it does not exist,

1:20:13.100 --> 1:20:15.760
 nor is there a specific pill or chemical

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:19.020
 that will allow you to download more information

1:20:19.020 --> 1:20:20.480
 more quickly.

1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:23.100
 This is the issue around nootropics

1:20:23.100 --> 1:20:24.740
 I've talked about before.

1:20:24.740 --> 1:20:26.740
 There are things that can increase focus,

1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:28.660
 mainly things that increase acetylcholine

1:20:28.660 --> 1:20:31.120
 and transmission through the nicotine system,

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:34.060
 things that can increase dopamine, things like L-tyrosine.

1:20:34.060 --> 1:20:35.540
 Again, I'm not recommending these.

1:20:35.540 --> 1:20:37.340
 You need to heed the warnings on those bottles,

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:39.940
 but they will increase these neurochemicals.

1:20:39.940 --> 1:20:41.060
 And there are, of course,

1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:42.200
 things that will increase epinephrine,

1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:44.860
 things like caffeine or some people,

1:20:44.860 --> 1:20:47.200
 because of prescription, take Adderall.

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.820
 I'm, again, not suggesting people take any of these things.

1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:53.340
 In fact, today I focused almost exclusively

1:20:53.340 --> 1:20:57.980
 on behavioral tools and ways of structuring learning bouts

1:20:57.980 --> 1:21:00.300
 that will allow you to access more plasticity

1:21:00.300 --> 1:21:01.660
 regardless of age.

1:21:01.660 --> 1:21:04.360
 And they center around things that I'm sure

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:07.680
 if you look around you, you'll see evidence for,

1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:09.420
 oh, incremental learning is powerful,

1:21:09.420 --> 1:21:11.980
 or, oh, the vestibular system

1:21:11.980 --> 1:21:13.940
 can open up opportunities for plasticity.

1:21:13.940 --> 1:21:15.880
 I'm sure that the yogis out there are all saying,

1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:18.420
 wait, this sounds exactly like yoga.

1:21:18.420 --> 1:21:21.860
 We're supposed to push to an edge and do these inversions

1:21:21.860 --> 1:21:23.060
 and do all those sorts of things.

1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:23.940
 Well, I want to be clear.

1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:25.540
 I never said anyone should do inversions.

1:21:25.540 --> 1:21:29.180
 I said that the vestibular system is a valuable portal

1:21:29.180 --> 1:21:30.660
 into some of these neurochemical states

1:21:30.660 --> 1:21:32.120
 that favor plasticity.

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:36.140
 But not so seldom I hear from the yoga community,

1:21:36.140 --> 1:21:37.540
 and they will say things like,

1:21:37.540 --> 1:21:39.660
 much of what you're saying about how the brain works

1:21:39.660 --> 1:21:42.500
 or neuroplasticity has already been described

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.300
 is embedded in yoga practices.

1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:45.420
 And I just want to be very clear.

1:21:45.420 --> 1:21:48.600
 I have tremendous respect for the yoga community

1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:49.700
 and the practices.

1:21:49.700 --> 1:21:51.060
 I've done yoga from time to time.

1:21:51.060 --> 1:21:52.900
 I find it challenging and valuable.

1:21:52.900 --> 1:21:54.900
 I'm not a regular practitioner.

1:21:54.900 --> 1:21:57.980
 But the problem with yoga

1:21:57.980 --> 1:22:00.840
 is exactly the same problem with science,

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:05.740
 which is that yoga has a lot of practices

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:08.300
 for which there are very specific names,

1:22:08.300 --> 1:22:11.680
 but no description or lending of understanding

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:13.140
 about mechanism.

1:22:13.140 --> 1:22:16.260
 And science has a lot of mechanisms

1:22:16.260 --> 1:22:17.780
 and a lot of publications and papers

1:22:17.780 --> 1:22:20.460
 for which there's very little, if not no description

1:22:20.460 --> 1:22:22.260
 of tools and practices.

1:22:22.260 --> 1:22:26.220
 So my goal in not just today,

1:22:26.220 --> 1:22:28.640
 but in many ways throughout the course of the podcast

1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:32.080
 is to bridge the gaps between these various disciplines

1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:34.340
 in ways that are grounded mainly

1:22:34.340 --> 1:22:37.780
 to the fields of neuroscience and some related fields.

1:22:37.780 --> 1:22:40.320
 So yes, it's true that I look at things

1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:41.900
 mainly through the lens of science,

1:22:41.900 --> 1:22:43.260
 but that's not to say

1:22:43.260 --> 1:22:47.140
 that it exhaustively explains everything about anything,

1:22:47.140 --> 1:22:49.180
 nor is it to say that it's the only lens

1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:50.460
 through which one could look at

1:22:50.460 --> 1:22:52.180
 something like neuroplasticity.

1:22:52.180 --> 1:22:54.680
 So I just want to acknowledge that I have great respect

1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:56.780
 for all these different practices and communities.

1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.880
 And I think that indeed,

1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:00.700
 there are many cases in which

1:23:00.700 --> 1:23:02.380
 different communities and practices

1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:07.340
 have been aimed at targeting the same goals or outcomes.

1:23:07.340 --> 1:23:09.040
 Science and neuroscience

1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:11.240
 through an understanding of mechanism

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:13.160
 can allow all of us

1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:15.420
 to gain a kind of common understanding

1:23:15.420 --> 1:23:16.820
 about what those practices are

1:23:16.820 --> 1:23:19.020
 and how to access things like neuroplasticity,

1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:20.860
 sleep, et cetera.

1:23:20.860 --> 1:23:24.500
 And I do believe, as I've said previously on this podcast,

1:23:24.500 --> 1:23:25.980
 that understanding mechanism

1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:28.100
 affords us a certain flexibility,

1:23:28.100 --> 1:23:30.060
 and I don't mean physical flexibility.

1:23:30.060 --> 1:23:31.460
 I mean a flexibility

1:23:31.460 --> 1:23:34.340
 when we can't engage in a particular behavior,

1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:35.260
 maybe we're injured

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:37.020
 or maybe we're not in the right situation

1:23:37.020 --> 1:23:38.720
 to do a particular practice,

1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:40.620
 but by thinking about mechanism,

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:43.020
 we can adapt our circumstances.

1:23:43.020 --> 1:23:44.940
 I've talked about this with sleep.

1:23:44.940 --> 1:23:47.300
 If you're rigidly attached to one protocol

1:23:47.300 --> 1:23:48.500
 of always looking at sunlight

1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:50.980
 at one particular time in the morning and in the evening,

1:23:50.980 --> 1:23:53.960
 that is not as valuable as understanding the mechanisms

1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:55.940
 of why you might look at sunlight

1:23:55.940 --> 1:23:57.800
 at one particular time versus another,

1:23:57.800 --> 1:23:59.620
 because that affords you a flexibility,

1:23:59.620 --> 1:24:00.640
 allows you to adapt,

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:02.400
 and life is very dynamic,

1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:03.780
 and we don't have control

1:24:03.780 --> 1:24:06.580
 over all the external conditions all the time.

1:24:06.580 --> 1:24:08.360
 And so understanding mechanism

1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:09.500
 through the lens of neuroscience,

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:11.500
 I do believe can be very powerful

1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:14.660
 because of course there are multiple ways to access dopamine.

1:24:14.660 --> 1:24:17.080
 There are multiple ways to adjust limbic friction.

1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:19.240
 It's not just through respiration.

1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:21.880
 Of course, there are many ways to do that.

1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:25.060
 And so my overall goal here in this episode

1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:26.460
 and with this podcast

1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:29.700
 is to give you some understanding of the mechanisms

1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:32.100
 and the insights into the underlying biology

1:24:32.100 --> 1:24:33.960
 that allow you to tailor

1:24:33.960 --> 1:24:38.060
 what these kind of foundational mechanisms are

1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:40.760
 to suit your particular learning needs.

1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:44.000
 So I really thank you for your time and attention today.

1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.500
 I've covered a lot of material.

1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:49.000
 I very much encourage questions in the comment section

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.020
 if you're looking at this on YouTube,

1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:52.700
 and if you're not and you're listening to it

1:24:52.700 --> 1:24:54.100
 on Apple or Spotify,

1:24:54.100 --> 1:24:57.780
 please feel free to visit us over on the YouTube channel

1:24:57.780 --> 1:24:59.700
 and put your questions in the comment section.

1:24:59.700 --> 1:25:00.600
 I do read them.

1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:02.780
 This entire month is all about neuroplasticity.

1:25:02.780 --> 1:25:04.180
 There's a lot to cover,

1:25:04.180 --> 1:25:06.600
 but I'm very excited to delve deeper into this topic

1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:09.100
 as it relates to your particular interests.

1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:10.540
 Many of you have graciously asked

1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:12.700
 how you can help support the podcast.

1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:13.860
 The best way you can do that

1:25:13.860 --> 1:25:15.980
 is to subscribe to the YouTube channel

1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:17.700
 if you haven't done that already,

1:25:17.700 --> 1:25:20.660

1:25:20.660 --> 1:25:23.160
 or comments if you'd like to give us feedback.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:27.020
 Also to subscribe on Apple and or Spotify,

1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:29.740
 and Apple allows you to leave a five-star review

1:25:29.740 --> 1:25:32.120
 if you believe we deserve a five-star review,

1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:35.020
 as well as leave comments about the podcast.

1:25:35.020 --> 1:25:37.940
 In addition, if you can suggest the podcast

1:25:37.940 --> 1:25:39.880
 to your friends, to your family members,

1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:42.300
 or anyone that you think might be able to use

1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:43.660
 and appreciate the information,

1:25:43.660 --> 1:25:45.500
 that's a terrific way to support us.

1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:47.340
 And of course, check out our sponsors

1:25:47.340 --> 1:25:48.580
 that we mentioned at the beginning.

1:25:48.580 --> 1:25:51.160
 That's a terrific way to support us as well.

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:53.060
 Several times throughout today's episode,

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:55.780
 as well as on previous episodes of the podcast,

1:25:55.780 --> 1:25:57.700
 I've talked about various supplements

1:25:57.700 --> 1:26:00.620
 that can be useful for enhancing sleep,

1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:03.140
 enhancing neuroplasticity, et cetera.

1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:05.780
 And again, I want to emphasize that I always think

1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:08.740
 that behavioral practices are the place to start.

1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:10.380
 I don't think supplements should ever be

1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:12.580
 the first line of entry for people looking

1:26:12.580 --> 1:26:15.340
 to enhance these aspects of their nervous system in life.

1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:17.700
 But for those of you that are interested in supplements

1:26:17.700 --> 1:26:19.260
 and the supplements that I take,

1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:21.600
 I'm pleased to announce that we partnered with Thorne,

1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:25.700
 T-H-O-R-N-E, and Thorne makes supplements

1:26:25.700 --> 1:26:28.720
 that are, in my opinion, of the very highest stringency

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:31.260
 in terms of what's listed on the bottle

1:26:31.260 --> 1:26:32.940
 is actually what you'll find in the bottle.

1:26:32.940 --> 1:26:35.380
 This is a serious issue for the supplement industry,

1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:37.420
 as well as just the overall quality

1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:39.960
 of the materials they put into their supplements.

1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:41.580
 If you'd like to take a look at the supplements

1:26:41.580 --> 1:26:45.380
 that I take, as well as explore any of them for yourself,

1:26:45.380 --> 1:26:50.380
 you can go to Thorne.com slash U slash Huberman.

1:26:50.540 --> 1:26:52.180
 And if you look there, you'll see a number

1:26:52.180 --> 1:26:53.920
 of the different supplements that I take.

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:55.940
 And if you decide to purchase any of them,

1:26:55.940 --> 1:26:57.580
 you'll get 20% off your order.

1:26:57.580 --> 1:27:02.540
 So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E slash U slash Huberman

1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:03.940
 to see the supplements that I take

1:27:03.940 --> 1:27:07.540
 and to explore if any of them are right for you.

1:27:07.540 --> 1:27:09.180
 In the next episode of this podcast,

1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:12.340
 we're going to continue to explore neuroplasticity.

1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:15.040
 This, as you may recall, is the way that we go about things

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:16.420
 here at the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:27:16.420 --> 1:27:19.300
 which is to really drill deeply into a topic

1:27:19.300 --> 1:27:21.940
 for three or four or even five episodes

1:27:21.940 --> 1:27:24.120
 so that by the end of those episodes,

1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:26.220
 all of you have a very firm understanding

1:27:26.220 --> 1:27:28.940
 of how to apply the principles of neurobiology

1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:31.540
 to the specific practices and endeavors

1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:33.300
 that are most important to you.

1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:36.100
 So I very much thank you for your time and attention.

1:27:36.100 --> 1:27:38.020
 I know it's a lot of information

1:27:38.020 --> 1:27:40.460
 and it takes a bit of focus and attention

1:27:40.460 --> 1:27:43.140
 and certainly will trigger plasticity

1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:45.140
 to learn all this information.

1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:47.480
 I want to encourage you and just remind you

1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:49.940
 that you don't have to grasp it all at once,

1:27:49.940 --> 1:27:51.580
 that it is here archived.

1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:53.440
 And then if you want to return to the information,

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:54.900
 it will still be here.

1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:58.040
 And that I most of all really appreciate

1:27:58.040 --> 1:27:59.340
 your interest in science.

1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:00.180
 Thank you so much.

1:28:00.180 --> 1:28:01.700
 Thank you.

1:28:01.700 --> 1:28:02.540
 Thank you.

1:28:02.540 --> 1:28:03.380
 Thank you.

1:28:03.380 --> 1:28:30.380
 Thank you.
