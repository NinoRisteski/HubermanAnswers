00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.340
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.340 --> 00:13.140
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.140 --> 00:15.140
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.940
 Today, we're talking all about fasting.

00:17.940 --> 00:20.220
 And anytime we're talking about fasting,

00:20.220 --> 00:22.020
 we are also talking about eating

00:22.020 --> 00:24.700
 because we all need to eat sooner or later.

00:24.700 --> 00:28.700
 We're going to talk about how fasting and when we eat

00:28.700 --> 00:32.540
 influences a large range of aspects of our health

00:32.540 --> 00:35.560
 and wellbeing, both physical and mental.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.700
 So while nowadays,

00:36.700 --> 00:40.780
 most people are familiar with the term intermittent fasting,

00:40.780 --> 00:43.940
 also sometimes called time-restricted feeding,

00:43.940 --> 00:46.380
 I think most people don't really understand

00:46.380 --> 00:48.100
 how that process works.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.420
 It's sort of obvious that intermittent fasting,

00:50.420 --> 00:52.660
 AKA time-restricted feeding,

00:52.660 --> 00:56.300
 involves eating at certain periods of each 24-hour cycle,

00:56.300 --> 01:00.160
 or maybe even not eating for entire days in some cases.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.760
 But if you think about it, everybody sleeps eventually.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.180
 And therefore, because people don't eat during their sleep,

01:08.180 --> 01:11.060
 almost everybody is employing some form

01:11.060 --> 01:13.900
 of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.380
 What we're going to talk about today

01:15.380 --> 01:19.900
 is how particular schedules of time-restricted feeding

01:19.900 --> 01:22.300
 can impact our health in different ways.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.780
 And when I say different ways,

01:23.780 --> 01:27.300
 I mean, we're going to talk about how intermittent fasting,

01:27.300 --> 01:30.860
 AKA time-restricted feeding, impacts weight loss,

01:30.860 --> 01:32.740
 fat loss in particular,

01:32.740 --> 01:35.780
 muscle maintenance and loss and gain,

01:35.780 --> 01:39.080
 organ health, such as gut health and liver health,

01:39.080 --> 01:44.080
 the genome, the epigenome, inflammation, sickness,

01:44.340 --> 01:47.100
 recovery and healing from sickness,

01:47.100 --> 01:50.860
 exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.380
 So we're going to cover a tremendous amount of information.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.340
 I promise to make it all directly accessible,

01:56.340 --> 01:58.260
 regardless of whether or not you have a background

01:58.260 --> 02:02.760
 in biology and metabolic science or not.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.040
 I'm also going to talk about a lot of tools.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.580
 In fact, I'm going to discuss a number of tools

02:07.580 --> 02:10.480
 during today's episode that actually make it such

02:10.480 --> 02:14.660
 that you don't have to follow any feeding schedule

02:14.660 --> 02:17.860
 or fasting schedule, same thing if you think about it,

02:17.860 --> 02:22.600
 in any absolutely strict regimented way,

02:22.600 --> 02:25.100
 meaning if you were to only eat

02:25.100 --> 02:27.820
 during an eight-hour period of each day, most of the time,

02:27.820 --> 02:28.860
 but then occasionally eat

02:28.860 --> 02:30.780
 across a 12-hour period of the day.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.780
 In theory, that could actually have

02:33.780 --> 02:36.220
 pretty serious detrimental health effects.

02:36.220 --> 02:38.140
 And yet there are things that you can do

02:38.140 --> 02:40.260
 to attenuate those negative effects.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.460
 In fact, there are things that you can do and or take

02:43.460 --> 02:46.540
 that can make it as if you did not eat at all.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.900
 And so we'll discuss what those tools are.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.620
 And in many cases for sake of health, weight loss,

02:51.620 --> 02:53.100
 and performance,

02:53.100 --> 02:55.780
 making the body think that it did not eat at all

02:55.780 --> 02:57.860
 can actually be quite beneficial.

02:57.860 --> 02:59.780
 So today we're going to cover mechanism

02:59.780 --> 03:01.000
 and we're going to cover tools.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.100
 Before we do that,

03:02.100 --> 03:04.200
 I want to highlight a particular result

03:04.200 --> 03:05.240
 that was published recently

03:05.240 --> 03:07.600
 because it serves as a useful backbone

03:07.600 --> 03:10.880
 as we wade into the conversation about fasting.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.900
 This is a study that was published

03:12.900 --> 03:14.820
 in the journal Cell Metabolism,

03:14.820 --> 03:17.140
 a cell press journal, excellent journal.

03:17.140 --> 03:20.860
 And the title of the paper is Fasting Blood Glucose

03:20.860 --> 03:24.940
 as a Predictor of Mortality, Lost in Translation.

03:24.940 --> 03:26.940
 And I'll explain what the lost in translation part

03:26.940 --> 03:28.100
 means in a moment.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.020
 But the basic takeaway of this study,

03:30.020 --> 03:32.260
 and I should mention that the first author of the study

03:32.260 --> 03:37.260
 is Paliyaguru, P-A-L-L-I-Y-A-G-U-R-U, guru,

03:39.140 --> 03:42.720
 Paliyaguru et al.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.840
 The basic finding of the study is that in humans,

03:45.840 --> 03:50.840
 higher blood glucose is associated with mortality.

03:51.820 --> 03:54.240
 And in fact, if you look at blood glucose,

03:54.240 --> 03:56.560
 resting blood glucose across the lifespan,

03:56.560 --> 03:58.740
 what you find is as people age,

03:58.740 --> 04:00.800
 resting blood glucose goes up.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.780
 Now this is very interesting because for a long time,

04:03.780 --> 04:06.920
 it was thought that metabolism actually goes down as we age.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.820
 And to some extent that's true,

04:08.820 --> 04:12.160
 but the reductions in metabolism are not nearly as robust

04:12.160 --> 04:15.040
 as we once thought that they were across the lifespan.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.820
 However, unless there's something done to mitigate

04:18.820 --> 04:21.840
 the increase in blood glucose associated with aging,

04:21.840 --> 04:25.540
 almost everybody experiences a gradual,

04:25.540 --> 04:28.240
 but regular increase in resting blood glucose

04:28.240 --> 04:30.320
 that predicts mortality.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.680
 Now the title, as I mentioned,

04:31.680 --> 04:34.680
 is Fasting Blood Glucose as a Predictor of Mortality,

04:34.680 --> 04:35.960
 Lost in Translation.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.600
 And the reason that they included lost in translation

04:38.600 --> 04:41.280
 in the title is that what I just told you,

04:41.280 --> 04:44.620
 that increases in resting blood glucose predict mortality

04:44.620 --> 04:48.360
 or are correlated with mortality is true for human beings

04:48.360 --> 04:50.880
 and for non-human primates, monkeys,

04:50.880 --> 04:53.720
 but the opposite is true in mice.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.720
 And so I thought it was important to use this study

04:56.720 --> 05:00.040
 as an example of where studies in mice often,

05:00.040 --> 05:04.200
 but not always translate to humans and to non-human primates.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.280
 So today I'm going to be careful to distinguish

05:06.280 --> 05:08.960
 when a study was performed in mice versus in humans,

05:08.960 --> 05:13.680
 because it seems that at least when discussing feeding,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.880
 blood glucose and other aspects of diet,

05:15.880 --> 05:18.140
 as they relate to health and wellbeing,

05:18.140 --> 05:21.040
 whether or not a study was performed in rodents

05:21.040 --> 05:23.880
 or in humans can be very important.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.760
 In this case,

05:24.760 --> 05:28.120
 the results were directly 180 degrees opposite

05:28.120 --> 05:29.060
 to one another.

05:29.060 --> 05:32.520
 In other words, in mice, resting blood glucose went down

05:32.520 --> 05:34.560
 and it was associated with mortality.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.600
 So lower blood glucose associated with mortality,

05:36.600 --> 05:37.440
 whereas in humans,

05:37.440 --> 05:40.200
 higher resting blood glucose was associated with mortality.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.140
 And obviously what we're mostly interested in

05:43.140 --> 05:46.160
 is health and wellbeing of ourselves, of humans.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.280
 I'm sure there are some people out there

05:47.280 --> 05:49.760
 that are intensely concerned about the health

05:49.760 --> 05:50.600
 and wellbeing of mice,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.720
 which you could imagine a few rare contexts

05:53.720 --> 05:54.580
 where that's important,

05:54.580 --> 05:57.180
 but obviously most of us are interested in human health.

05:57.180 --> 06:00.100
 So I'll be sure to emphasize when studies were performed

06:00.100 --> 06:02.180
 in humans versus in mice.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.200
 Before we begin,

06:03.200 --> 06:05.440
 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate

06:05.440 --> 06:07.920
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.760
 It is however,

06:08.760 --> 06:10.880
 part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost

06:10.880 --> 06:12.640
 to consumer information about science

06:12.640 --> 06:15.600
 and science related tools to the general public.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.640
 In keeping with that theme,

06:16.640 --> 06:19.480
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.480
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.680
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:23.680 --> 06:26.320
 that are the absolute highest quality.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.560
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system

06:28.560 --> 06:30.420
 and how we see.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.800
 And Roca, which is a company developed

06:32.800 --> 06:34.760
 by two all American swimmers from Stanford

06:34.760 --> 06:36.820
 has developed eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:36.820 --> 06:39.440
 that take into account the science of vision

06:39.440 --> 06:42.320
 and they've produced an absolutely terrific product.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.220
 That product involves glasses that,

06:44.220 --> 06:46.560
 first of all, are very lightweight.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.140
 Second of all, can be worn when performing any activity.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.800
 There really are performance eyeglasses and sunglasses.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.840
 So whether or not you're sweating or running around,

06:54.840 --> 06:55.760
 whether or not you're working,

06:55.760 --> 06:58.480
 whether or not you're hiking, cycling, et cetera,

06:58.480 --> 07:00.880
 you can wear them for essentially any activity.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.720
 The nice thing is they also have a great aesthetic.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.040
 So unlike a lot of other performance sunglasses

07:05.040 --> 07:06.560
 and eyeglasses out there

07:06.560 --> 07:08.880
 that can make people look more or less like cyborgs,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.200
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses look great

07:11.200 --> 07:13.000
 whether or not you're wearing them to dinner or at work,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
 or whether or not you're headed out for a run or a cycle

07:15.000 --> 07:17.080
 or something of that sort.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.720
 As I mentioned before, they're extremely lightweight.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.120
 They don't slip off.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.400
 And that's true regardless of what activity

07:22.400 --> 07:23.560
 you're engaging in.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.020
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

07:25.020 --> 07:28.260
 you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com

07:28.260 --> 07:30.920
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off

07:30.920 --> 07:32.200
 your first order.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.480
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.880
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:37.880 --> 07:40.160
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

07:40.160 --> 07:41.800
 to help you better understand your body

07:41.800 --> 07:43.740
 and help you meet your health goals.

07:43.740 --> 07:46.620
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:46.620 --> 07:48.940
 for the simple reason that many of the processes

07:48.940 --> 07:50.040
 that are occurring in your body

07:50.040 --> 07:52.920
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

07:52.920 --> 07:55.460
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.120
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

07:58.120 --> 07:59.720
 you can also assess your genome

07:59.720 --> 08:02.800
 and how that's impacting your immediate and long-term health.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.860
 The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests

08:04.860 --> 08:06.480
 is you get information back,

08:06.480 --> 08:08.240
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.520
 And InsideTracker has solved that problem.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.440
 They have a very easy to use dashboard

08:12.440 --> 08:14.240
 so that when you get your results back,

08:14.240 --> 08:15.760
 it will tell you, for instance,

08:15.760 --> 08:18.160
 if your levels of a particular metabolic factor

08:18.160 --> 08:20.120
 or hormone are too high or too low,

08:20.120 --> 08:21.840
 what you can do, what you can take,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.080
 how you can change your nutrition

08:23.080 --> 08:24.560
 in order to adjust those levels

08:24.560 --> 08:26.720
 and get them where you want them to be.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.160
 This is tremendously useful and takes all the guesswork

08:29.160 --> 08:32.320
 out of what to do with biomarker information.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.960
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

08:41.960 --> 08:44.640
 Today's episode is brought to us by Helix Sleep.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.880
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

08:46.880 --> 08:49.080
 that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.160
 And in doing so, provide the best sleep possible.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.980
 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

08:53.980 --> 08:55.760
 about a year or so ago,

08:55.760 --> 08:58.060
 and it is the best sleep that I've ever had.

08:58.060 --> 08:59.360
 If you go to the Helix site,

08:59.360 --> 09:01.240
 you take a brief two-minute quiz,

09:01.240 --> 09:03.820
 and that quiz asks you questions such as,

09:03.820 --> 09:05.520
 do you tend to sleep on your stomach, your side,

09:05.520 --> 09:07.480
 or your back, do you tend to run hot or cold

09:07.480 --> 09:09.040
 during the night, maybe you don't know.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.880
 And they match you to a particular mattress

09:10.880 --> 09:12.400
 that's ideal for your sleep needs.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.520
 In my case, I matched to the so-called dusk mattress.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.720
 I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress, as I mentioned,

09:17.720 --> 09:21.240
 it's absolutely terrific, best sleep I've ever had.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.760
 It's really key to get a mattress

09:22.760 --> 09:24.820
 that's best suited to you.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.460
 If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

09:26.460 --> 09:29.360
 you can go to helixsleep.com, take that two-minute quiz,

09:29.360 --> 09:32.080
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.640
 And you'll get up to $200 off any of your mattress orders,

09:35.640 --> 09:37.360
 and you'll get two free pillows.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.580
 If you're interested in Helix Sleep,

09:38.580 --> 09:40.960
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

09:40.960 --> 09:43.160
 and you'll get up to $200 off your mattress

09:43.160 --> 09:44.480
 and two free pillows.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.160
 I'd like to point you toward a valuable resource

09:47.160 --> 09:51.520
 that's also zero cost and is available now online.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.320
 This is an event that was recorded.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.240
 The event was held by Logitech,

09:56.240 --> 09:58.780
 and I was fortunate enough to partake in this event.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.840
 And the entire event was centered around

10:00.840 --> 10:04.000
 how to be a more effective learner and teacher

10:04.000 --> 10:07.260
 using the modern principles of neuroplasticity.

10:07.260 --> 10:11.180
 So at the link in the caption for this episode,

10:11.180 --> 10:14.860
 you can go to what was called the Rethink Education event.

10:14.860 --> 10:18.400
 And there, I gave a seminar of about 20 or 30 minutes

10:18.400 --> 10:21.940
 describing the modern neuroscience of neuroplasticity,

10:21.940 --> 10:23.700
 the nervous system's ability to change

10:23.700 --> 10:25.500
 in response to experience.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.160
 I focused mainly on human studies

10:28.160 --> 10:32.000
 and how different structures and different things

10:32.000 --> 10:34.160
 and tools that one can implement in the classroom

10:34.160 --> 10:37.060
 and outside of the classroom can lead to faster

10:37.060 --> 10:41.220
 and more pervasive, longer lasting learning of motor skills,

10:41.220 --> 10:44.840
 music skills, mathematical skills, language skills, et cetera,

10:44.840 --> 10:47.740
 all based on quality peer viewed research.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.260
 So if you'd like to check that out,

10:49.260 --> 10:50.260
 you can head to that link.

10:50.260 --> 10:53.840
 You'll also see an example of some of those tools in action

10:53.840 --> 10:57.920
 in a music classroom of a phenomenal music teacher,

10:57.920 --> 11:01.120
 Ben Edy, who's a teacher out in Pasadena,

11:01.120 --> 11:02.660
 who has applied these tools,

11:02.660 --> 11:05.100
 at least to my knowledge for the first time ever.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.700
 Of course, all the tools that are there are listed out

11:07.700 --> 11:10.960
 in what I call a plasticity super protocol.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.720
 And all those tools can be applied to learning and teaching

11:13.720 --> 11:15.740
 in any format that you like.

11:15.740 --> 11:16.660
 So check it out.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.340
 It's in the caption to this week's episode

11:19.340 --> 11:20.460
 and it will remain there.

11:20.460 --> 11:23.140
 It's up on YouTube and I hope you enjoy it.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.940
 Okay, so let's talk about feeding,

11:24.940 --> 11:28.140
 fasting, health, and performance.

11:28.140 --> 11:32.220
 And I want to just establish a few foundational terms

11:32.220 --> 11:34.100
 so that we're all on the same page.

11:34.100 --> 11:34.940
 First of all,

11:34.940 --> 11:38.340
 rather than talk about fasting or time restricted feeding,

11:38.340 --> 11:41.040
 I'm largely going to talk about time restricted feeding,

11:41.040 --> 11:44.020
 but please understand that time restricted feeding

11:44.020 --> 11:48.080
 is just one side of the coin that is a two-sided coin

11:48.080 --> 11:50.780
 that includes fasting on the one hand, not eating,

11:50.780 --> 11:53.060
 and time restricted feeding on the other hand.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.140
 I may occasionally say fasting,

11:55.140 --> 11:58.340
 but because fasting and eating establish

11:58.340 --> 12:00.920
 different biological conditions in the body,

12:00.920 --> 12:03.840
 time restricted feeding is the term that I will use

12:03.840 --> 12:06.840
 to describe the overall plan

12:06.840 --> 12:10.060
 of restricting one's eating window as it's called

12:10.060 --> 12:13.820
 to a particular phase of each 24 hour day,

12:13.820 --> 12:18.220
 or in some cases to particular days within the week,

12:18.220 --> 12:19.860
 because as you'll soon learn,

12:19.860 --> 12:22.540
 there are aspects of time restricted feeding,

12:22.540 --> 12:26.300
 AKA fasting, that involve eating every other day

12:26.300 --> 12:28.860
 or eating one way for five days

12:28.860 --> 12:31.180
 and then fasting for two days and so forth.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.640
 So I'll be very precise about what I mean

12:33.640 --> 12:36.420
 and why I mean it, but for the time being,

12:36.420 --> 12:40.240
 I'm going to refer to time restricted feeding

12:40.240 --> 12:43.800
 as a way to put an umbrella over this conversation.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.900
 Second of all,

12:44.900 --> 12:48.180
 I am going to emphasize a lot of biological mechanism.

12:48.180 --> 12:50.600
 If you've listened to this podcast before,

12:50.600 --> 12:53.940
 you know that I always begin with biological mechanism.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.260
 I do describe tools of how to implement those mechanisms,

12:57.260 --> 13:01.020
 but I wholeheartedly believe that knowing mechanisms

13:01.020 --> 13:03.780
 and understanding how these processes work

13:03.780 --> 13:07.700
 gives you tremendous flexibility and understanding

13:07.700 --> 13:10.100
 and control over the processes

13:10.100 --> 13:11.500
 of your mental and physical health.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.300
 Whereas if I were to just list off a menu of things to do

13:15.300 --> 13:18.280
 and not to do, those will work,

13:18.280 --> 13:22.100
 but those will not give you the kind of understanding

13:22.100 --> 13:24.380
 that would allow you to navigate through life,

13:24.380 --> 13:27.140
 through travel, through dinners out,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.780
 through different exercise schedules,

13:29.780 --> 13:31.500
 whether or not you're one age or another age,

13:31.500 --> 13:33.580
 male, female, et cetera,

13:33.580 --> 13:36.580
 I'm giving you mechanisms so that you can gain more control

13:36.580 --> 13:39.340
 over the systems in your brain and body.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.340
 Everything's timestamped,

13:40.340 --> 13:41.980
 so if you want to jump to the to-dos,

13:41.980 --> 13:43.220
 you can certainly do that,

13:43.220 --> 13:46.700
 but I encourage you to hang in there for the mechanism bit.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.140
 I will make it all very clear

13:48.140 --> 13:50.020
 because if you understand mechanism,

13:50.020 --> 13:51.700
 you are in a true place of power

13:51.700 --> 13:53.800
 and control over your biology.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.660
 If ever there was a topic that is controversial,

13:56.660 --> 13:58.000
 especially on the internet,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.700
 it is that of diet and nutrition.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.640
 So I'm wading into this with a smile

14:03.640 --> 14:06.420
 and in eager anticipation of all the,

14:06.420 --> 14:09.120
 but, but, but this, and but, but that, and wait,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.820
 but this showed that.

14:10.820 --> 14:11.900
 Here's the deal.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.860
 We need to precisely define what it is

14:14.860 --> 14:18.120
 that we're talking about when we talk about nutrition.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.160
 I'm going to give you an example of a study

14:20.160 --> 14:22.780
 that was published a few years ago, 2018,

14:22.780 --> 14:26.540
 by a colleague of mine at Stanford, Chris Gardner.

14:26.540 --> 14:29.900
 So a terrific professor of nutrition

14:29.900 --> 14:32.300
 and has done a lot of important studies

14:32.300 --> 14:36.320
 on how nutrition impacts different aspects of health.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.980
 This is a large scale study.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.620
 It was published in JAMA,

14:39.620 --> 14:41.620
 the Journal of the American Medical Association,

14:41.620 --> 14:45.660
 one of the very top tier journals in the area of medicine.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.540
 And certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up there

14:48.540 --> 14:51.340
 meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard.

14:52.700 --> 14:56.220
 This paper where Chris is the first author,

14:56.220 --> 14:58.460
 it's Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA,

14:59.580 --> 15:03.780
 looked at weight loss in people following

15:03.780 --> 15:06.980
 one particular diet versus another particular diet.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.500
 And this was a 12 month weight loss study.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.140
 So it was focused specifically on weight loss,

15:12.140 --> 15:14.580
 although they looked at some other parameters as well.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.620
 And the basic conclusion of the study was that

15:17.620 --> 15:20.300
 there was no significant difference in weight change

15:20.300 --> 15:23.540
 between people following a healthy low fat diet

15:23.540 --> 15:25.760
 versus a healthy low carbohydrate diet

15:25.760 --> 15:28.220
 with significantly more dietary fats in them.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.700
 This caused a lot of ripples in the world of nutrition

15:33.700 --> 15:35.020
 and nutritional science,

15:35.020 --> 15:37.380
 and certainly in the general population,

15:37.380 --> 15:41.020
 because anyone that understands diet and nutrition

15:41.020 --> 15:42.940
 would immediately say, but wait,

15:42.940 --> 15:45.020
 there are all sorts of different implications

15:45.020 --> 15:46.980
 of eating one type of diet,

15:46.980 --> 15:49.100
 say low carbohydrate, higher fats,

15:49.100 --> 15:52.100
 versus a higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.560
 And indeed there are.

15:53.560 --> 15:57.220
 This study was focused specifically on fat loss

15:57.220 --> 15:58.980
 and on weight loss.

15:58.980 --> 16:03.340
 So as we discuss time restricted feeding,

16:03.340 --> 16:06.060
 we need to be very precise about what are the effects

16:06.060 --> 16:09.780
 of time restricted feeding and of eating in particular ways

16:09.780 --> 16:11.560
 at particular times,

16:11.560 --> 16:13.140
 we are going to emphasize again,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.900
 whether or not the study was done in mice or in humans,

16:15.900 --> 16:18.460
 in athletes and men and women or both.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.740
 But the study from Gardner and colleagues

16:20.740 --> 16:23.680
 is a beautiful study and really emphasizes that

16:23.680 --> 16:27.640
 if one's main goal is simply to lose weight,

16:27.640 --> 16:31.940
 then it really does not matter what one eats,

16:31.940 --> 16:35.360
 provided that the number of calories burned

16:35.360 --> 16:38.140
 is higher than the number of calories ingested.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.900
 However, anyone out there who understands

16:41.900 --> 16:45.980
 a little bit of biology or a lot of biology will agree

16:45.980 --> 16:48.340
 that there are many factors that impact

16:48.340 --> 16:50.960
 that calories burned part of the equation.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.340
 Some of those are obvious.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.220
 So for instance, amount of exercise,

16:55.220 --> 16:57.860
 type of exercise, basal metabolic rate,

16:57.860 --> 17:00.540
 how much energy one burns just sitting there.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.540
 I've talked before on this podcast about meat,

17:02.540 --> 17:04.740
 non-exercise induced thermogenesis,

17:04.740 --> 17:07.240
 where if people bounce around a lot and fidget a lot,

17:07.240 --> 17:11.020
 they can burn anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories per day.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.500
 So their quote unquote basal metabolic rate

17:13.500 --> 17:15.580
 is actually much higher simply because they're fidgeters.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.320
 Whereas people who tend to be more stationary

17:17.320 --> 17:19.780
 have a lower basal metabolic rate on average.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.660
 There's a great science to support this.

17:22.660 --> 17:27.140
 Metabolic factors and hormones are also very important.

17:27.140 --> 17:30.360
 Hormones such as thyroid hormone and insulin

17:30.360 --> 17:32.560
 and growth hormone and the sex story to hormones,

17:32.560 --> 17:34.260
 testosterone and estrogen,

17:34.260 --> 17:37.000
 those levels will also profoundly influence

17:37.000 --> 17:39.680
 the calories out the calories of burned component

17:39.680 --> 17:42.500
 of the calories in calories out equation.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.420
 So if out there on the internet

17:45.420 --> 17:48.300
 or in listening to a particular podcast or speaker,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.820
 somebody says, this is the ideal diet

17:50.820 --> 17:53.660
 or calories in calories out does not matter

17:53.660 --> 17:56.460
 or calories in calories out is the only thing that matters.

17:56.460 --> 17:58.100
 I think it's very important to understand

17:58.100 --> 17:59.960
 that there are some foundational truths

17:59.960 --> 18:01.940
 such as calories in calories out,

18:01.940 --> 18:04.960
 but that of course hormone factors

18:04.960 --> 18:08.660
 and the context in which a given diet regimen

18:08.660 --> 18:11.180
 is taking place are exceedingly important.

18:11.180 --> 18:14.120
 A good example of this would be puberty.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.120
 At that time in life,

18:16.120 --> 18:18.680
 sex story to hormones are changing profoundly in the body

18:18.680 --> 18:21.220
 as our growth hormone and other hormones.

18:21.220 --> 18:23.300
 And much of caloric intake

18:23.300 --> 18:26.220
 is directed towards protein synthesis,

18:26.220 --> 18:27.860
 towards the production of muscle and bone

18:27.860 --> 18:29.220
 and other tissues of the body.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.100
 And that's because of changes in hormones

18:31.100 --> 18:32.460
 that we call puberty.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.560
 So there's no way that we can drill into every aspect

18:36.560 --> 18:41.480
 of a given feeding plan or feeding schedule

18:41.480 --> 18:43.860
 that would allow us to tap into every aspect

18:43.860 --> 18:46.700
 of the list that I read out before weight loss,

18:46.700 --> 18:48.660
 fat loss, muscle, organ, genome, epigenome,

18:48.660 --> 18:51.500
 inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.060
 But today we're going to be very precise

18:53.060 --> 18:55.980
 about how time restricted feeding.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.460
 It's very clear from both animal studies

18:58.460 --> 19:02.040
 and human studies can have a very powerful

19:02.040 --> 19:06.060
 and positive impact on everything from weight loss

19:06.060 --> 19:09.540
 and fat loss to various health parameters.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.820
 This is a beautiful literature that's emerged mostly

19:12.820 --> 19:15.020
 in the last 10 or 15 years.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.680
 And as we march into this literature,

19:16.680 --> 19:20.140
 what you'll see is that there actually is a perfect diet

19:20.140 --> 19:23.260
 for you on a given day.

19:23.260 --> 19:27.820
 And that perfect diet for you on a given day is contextual,

19:27.820 --> 19:30.660
 meaning it depends on what you did yesterday

19:30.660 --> 19:32.920
 and what you're going to do tomorrow.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.960
 So there is a perfect diet for you.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.080
 And today I'm going to arm you with the mechanisms

19:37.080 --> 19:39.440
 and understanding that will allow you to define

19:39.440 --> 19:40.980
 what that perfect diet is,

19:40.980 --> 19:43.980
 and will allow you to eat on a schedule

19:43.980 --> 19:46.220
 and to eat the things that are going

19:46.220 --> 19:48.200
 to best serve your goals.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.360
 So let's talk about eating and what happens when you eat.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.340
 And let's talk about fasting or not eating

19:54.340 --> 19:55.900
 and what happens when you fast.

19:56.740 --> 19:59.980
 I did an entire episode on eating and metabolism

19:59.980 --> 20:03.640
 and hormones and other factors that impact appetite.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.660
 We don't have time to go into all those details now,

20:05.660 --> 20:08.500
 although you're welcome to listen to that episode as well.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.500
 But we can briefly describe the overall conditions

20:13.500 --> 20:17.560
 that are set in the body when we eat and when we don't eat.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.100
 The key word here is conditions.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.340
 If I can emphasize anything today,

20:23.340 --> 20:26.820
 it's that what you eat and when you eat it,

20:26.820 --> 20:29.420
 set conditions in your body.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.720
 And those conditions can be very good for you

20:31.720 --> 20:35.780
 or very bad for you, depending on when you eat.

20:35.780 --> 20:40.780
 In fact, when you eat is as important as what you eat.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.580
 I'll repeat that.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.780
 When you eat is as important as what you eat,

20:44.780 --> 20:47.040
 at least as it relates to health parameters,

20:47.040 --> 20:50.340
 in particular, liver health and mental health.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.540
 Some simple rules about eating.

20:52.540 --> 20:56.500
 First of all, when you eat, typically your blood glucose,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.300
 your blood sugar will go up.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.280
 Also insulin levels will go up.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.540
 Insulin is a hormone that's involved in mobilizing glucose

21:04.540 --> 21:06.300
 from the bloodstream.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.620
 How much your glucose and insulin go up

21:09.620 --> 21:12.820
 depends on what you eat and how much you eat.

21:12.820 --> 21:17.820
 In general, simple sugars, including fructose from fruit,

21:17.860 --> 21:20.980
 but also sucrose and glucose and simple sugars

21:20.980 --> 21:23.220
 will raise your insulin and blood glucose

21:23.220 --> 21:26.260
 more than complex carbohydrates,

21:26.260 --> 21:28.940
 things like grains and breads and pastas and so forth.

21:28.940 --> 21:31.200
 And grains and breads and pastas and so forth

21:31.200 --> 21:32.940
 will raise your blood glucose more

21:32.940 --> 21:36.260
 than fibrous carbohydrates like lettuce and broccoli

21:36.260 --> 21:38.180
 and things of that sort.

21:38.180 --> 21:41.880
 Protein has a somewhat moderate or modest impact

21:41.880 --> 21:43.180
 on insulin and glucose.

21:43.180 --> 21:45.540
 And fat has the lowest impact

21:45.540 --> 21:48.780
 on raising your blood glucose and blood insulin.

21:48.780 --> 21:53.660
 So what you eat will impact how steep arise in blood glucose

21:53.660 --> 21:55.420
 and insulin takes place.

21:55.420 --> 21:57.260
 And there are a number of factors

21:57.260 --> 21:59.220
 that are related to your individual health

21:59.220 --> 22:01.780
 that will also dictate how steep and how high

22:01.780 --> 22:04.540
 that rise in glucose and insulin will be.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.540
 For the time being,

22:05.540 --> 22:08.360
 I'm leaving out people who have type one diabetes.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.900
 These are people that don't manufacture their own insulin

22:10.900 --> 22:15.580
 and type two diabetes is essentially insulin insensitivity,

22:16.880 --> 22:18.520
 lack of sensitivity to insulin,

22:18.520 --> 22:20.840
 which leads to high blood glucose.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.800
 But when you eat, blood glucose goes up

22:23.800 --> 22:27.660
 and when you don't eat blood glucose and insulin go down.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.820
 The longer it's been since your last meal,

22:29.820 --> 22:33.620
 the lower typically your blood glucose and insulin will be.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.580
 And the higher things like GLP-1,

22:36.580 --> 22:40.420
 glucagon like peptide one,

22:40.420 --> 22:44.660
 glucagon being a hormone that's also secreted

22:44.660 --> 22:49.260
 when you are in a fasted state or a low blood glucose state.

22:49.260 --> 22:53.160
 It's involved in mobilizing various energy sources

22:53.160 --> 22:57.120
 from the body, including fat through what we call lipolysis,

22:57.120 --> 22:59.960
 also using carbohydrates and potentially even using muscle

22:59.960 --> 23:01.240
 as a source of energy.

23:01.240 --> 23:06.240
 So that's kind of a fire hose of information

23:06.460 --> 23:08.100
 about what happens when you eat and don't eat,

23:08.100 --> 23:09.640
 but just think of it this way,

23:09.640 --> 23:11.980
 blood sugar and insulin go up when you eat,

23:11.980 --> 23:13.300
 they go down when you don't eat

23:13.300 --> 23:16.180
 and other hormones go up when you don't eat.

23:16.180 --> 23:19.300
 So there are hormones associated with the fasted state

23:19.300 --> 23:22.040
 and there are hormones associated with the eating

23:22.040 --> 23:25.000
 and having just eaten state.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.540
 Now, the most important thing to understand

23:28.540 --> 23:31.500
 is that like everything in biology,

23:31.500 --> 23:34.300
 this is a process that takes time.

23:34.300 --> 23:37.580
 So insulin and glucose go up when we eat

23:37.580 --> 23:39.980
 and it takes some period of time for them to go down.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.020
 Even if we stop eating,

23:42.020 --> 23:44.100
 they will remain up for some period of time

23:44.100 --> 23:45.460
 and then go back down.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.340
 It takes time.

23:47.340 --> 23:49.740
 This is very important because if you look

23:49.740 --> 23:52.740
 at the scientific literature on fasting,

23:52.740 --> 23:54.160
 on time restricted feeding,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.940
 it's absolutely clear that the health benefits,

23:58.940 --> 24:00.380
 not just the weight loss benefits,

24:00.380 --> 24:03.620
 but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding

24:03.620 --> 24:06.340
 occur because certain conditions are met

24:06.340 --> 24:10.300
 in the brain and body for a certain amount of time.

24:10.300 --> 24:14.340
 And that gives us an anchor from which to view

24:14.340 --> 24:17.740
 what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions

24:17.740 --> 24:19.600
 in the body over time.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.160
 And if that sounds overly analytic,

24:22.160 --> 24:24.740
 I promise you this is the simplest and best way

24:24.740 --> 24:28.500
 to think about any eating schedule or any eating plan.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.740
 So I think it's fair to say that in the field of nutrition,

24:31.740 --> 24:34.680
 there are a few landmark studies that serve

24:34.680 --> 24:38.260
 as really strong anchors for building our understanding

24:38.260 --> 24:40.660
 of what to eat and what not to eat and when to eat,

24:40.660 --> 24:42.300
 depending on our goals.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.340
 The Garner study that I mentioned earlier

24:44.340 --> 24:47.500
 is one such study in that it says,

24:47.500 --> 24:49.380
 if your goal is weight loss,

24:49.380 --> 24:53.460
 it really does not matter what foods you consume

24:53.460 --> 24:57.880
 provided that you consume a sub maintenance caloric diet.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.460
 However, I want to emphasize again,

25:00.460 --> 25:04.200
 that sets aside issues of adherence,

25:04.200 --> 25:07.640
 meaning how easy or hard it is to adhere to a given diet.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.180
 Some people find it much easier to follow a high fat,

25:10.180 --> 25:11.220
 low carbohydrate diet.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.180
 Some people follow a different diet

25:13.180 --> 25:15.580
 because it's much easier for them to follow.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.960
 And some people are concerned with mental performance

25:17.960 --> 25:18.960
 and athletic performance.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.100
 So that study doesn't say there's a best diet.

25:22.100 --> 25:26.420
 What it says is that what you consume is less important

25:26.420 --> 25:28.600
 than the amount of food that you consume,

25:28.600 --> 25:30.940
 at least for sake of weight loss,

25:30.940 --> 25:33.620
 not necessarily for sake of health.

25:33.620 --> 25:36.900
 Now, the study that I'm going to refer to next

25:36.900 --> 25:39.900
 is what I would consider the second major pillar

25:39.900 --> 25:41.020
 of nutritional studies.

25:41.020 --> 25:44.460
 This is a truly landmark study that was carried out

25:44.460 --> 25:47.680
 by Sachin Panda, who is a professor

25:47.680 --> 25:50.500
 at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in San Diego,

25:50.500 --> 25:52.860
 an absolutely phenomenal institution

25:52.860 --> 25:55.260
 and an absolutely phenomenal researcher.

25:55.260 --> 25:56.940
 I've known Sachin for a number of years.

25:56.940 --> 26:00.580
 And I want to emphasize that the current literature

26:00.580 --> 26:03.700
 on intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding

26:03.700 --> 26:07.040
 can largely be attributed to Sachin

26:07.040 --> 26:08.180
 and the work that he's done.

26:08.180 --> 26:10.940
 There are others involved too, of course.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.260
 And of course, time restricted feeding and fasting

26:13.260 --> 26:16.340
 has a rich history that goes back many hundreds,

26:16.340 --> 26:18.340
 if not thousands of years in different cultures

26:18.340 --> 26:21.500
 and religions, but the science of time restricted feeding

26:21.500 --> 26:24.280
 can really mainly be attributed to the incredible work

26:24.280 --> 26:25.620
 that Sachin has done.

26:25.620 --> 26:29.540
 And I'm grateful to consider him a friend and a colleague.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.500
 And we consulted at length in anticipation of this episode.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.140
 I also hope to have him on as a guest in the future.

26:35.140 --> 26:37.780
 The landmark paper that came from Sachin's lab

26:37.780 --> 26:39.780
 was published in 2012.

26:39.780 --> 26:42.860
 This was a paper in mice that set the basis

26:42.860 --> 26:44.940
 for studies in humans that came later.

26:44.940 --> 26:47.960
 And the title of this paper is time restricted feeding

26:47.960 --> 26:52.020
 without reducing caloric intake prevents metabolic diseases

26:52.020 --> 26:54.660
 in mice fed a high fat diet.

26:54.660 --> 26:56.480
 So the title tells us a lot.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.300
 It says that what's varied in this study

26:59.300 --> 27:01.860
 is not what these mice ate.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.940
 It was when they ate it.

27:03.940 --> 27:06.760
 And there were essentially four conditions in this study

27:06.760 --> 27:09.580
 and the results are absolutely remarkable.

27:09.580 --> 27:12.400
 So I'm going to walk you through the major results.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.540
 What they did is they gave mice access

27:15.540 --> 27:17.460
 to different types of food.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.840
 There were four groups.

27:18.840 --> 27:23.420
 One group of mice had access to just a normal mouse diet.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.820
 It would not be a diet that you'd be very interested in.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.720
 I confess I've actually tasted mouse chow.

27:27.720 --> 27:28.820
 If you work with mice at all,

27:28.820 --> 27:30.480
 you just have to do it at least once.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.420
 It doesn't taste very good.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.620
 It tastes like a very bland graham cracker cookie.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.700
 And I confess that I only had the tiniest little bit,

27:35.700 --> 27:37.420
 but mice like that stuff.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.340
 And if you allow them to eat that stuff,

27:39.340 --> 27:41.540
 what's called ad libitum, whenever they want,

27:41.540 --> 27:43.980
 you just keep it in their food 24 hours a day,

27:43.980 --> 27:45.200
 they will eat sometimes,

27:45.200 --> 27:46.940
 and then they won't eat it at other times.

27:46.940 --> 27:49.780
 Or in this case, they also had a condition

27:49.780 --> 27:52.820
 where they gave them mouse chow in a time restricted way,

27:52.820 --> 27:56.180
 just for a certain number of hours each day,

27:56.180 --> 27:57.580
 about eight hours.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.280
 Or they gave them a high fat diet that was a separate group,

28:02.280 --> 28:04.820
 got a high fat diet at any time they wanted.

28:04.820 --> 28:06.700
 So this was kind of the carnival for mice

28:06.700 --> 28:09.640
 because mice really like high fat, highly palatable foods.

28:09.640 --> 28:13.240
 And so they got a lot of goodies and high fat in their food.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.300
 And then there was a fourth group that had access

28:15.300 --> 28:17.920
 to the high fat diet as much as they wanted to eat,

28:17.920 --> 28:20.900
 but only during a restricted time period

28:20.900 --> 28:22.380
 of each 24 hour cycle.

28:22.380 --> 28:25.940
 Now mice are nocturnal, humans are what we call diurnal.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.340
 Actually, we're not really diurnal, we're crepuscular,

28:28.340 --> 28:30.460
 which means that we're most active in the morning

28:30.460 --> 28:32.820
 and in the evening, not so much in the afternoon.

28:32.820 --> 28:37.140
 But nonetheless, everything I'm going to tell you

28:37.140 --> 28:39.180
 is true also for humans.

28:39.180 --> 28:41.100
 And we know this now from human studies.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.820
 One of the most important things to take away

28:42.820 --> 28:46.380
 from the study was that mice that ate a highly palatable,

28:46.380 --> 28:48.600
 high fat diet, a great tasting diet,

28:48.600 --> 28:50.740
 but only during a restricted feeding window

28:50.740 --> 28:52.860
 of each 24 hour cycle,

28:52.860 --> 28:55.900
 maintained or lost weight over time.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.060
 Whereas mice that ingested the same diet,

28:59.060 --> 29:01.820
 same amount of calories,

29:01.820 --> 29:05.260
 but had access to those calories around the clock,

29:05.260 --> 29:08.620
 gained weight, became obese and quite sick.

29:08.620 --> 29:10.860
 And as an additional second point,

29:10.860 --> 29:13.680
 the mice that restricted their feeding window

29:13.680 --> 29:16.400
 to a particular portion of eight hours

29:16.400 --> 29:21.320
 of every 24 hour cycle actually showed some improvement

29:21.320 --> 29:23.380
 in important health markers.

29:23.380 --> 29:26.860
 And what was even more incredible is that mice

29:26.860 --> 29:29.300
 that only ate during a particular feeding window

29:30.300 --> 29:32.940
 also experienced some reversal

29:32.940 --> 29:35.560
 of some prior negative health effects.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.300
 So this study really lit up the world

29:38.300 --> 29:41.100
 and got people excited about time restricted eating.

29:42.540 --> 29:45.260
 Again, they used an eight hour feeding window.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.340
 The story around that eight hour feeding window

29:48.340 --> 29:49.900
 is kind of interesting though.

29:49.900 --> 29:50.900
 Not many people know this

29:50.900 --> 29:52.900
 because it wasn't included in the paper

29:52.900 --> 29:55.300
 and there was no reason to include it in the paper,

29:56.700 --> 29:57.980
 not to out anybody,

29:57.980 --> 29:59.700
 but it turns out that the reason

29:59.700 --> 30:01.600
 they used an eight hour feeding window

30:01.600 --> 30:04.460
 and not a nine hour or a 10 hour feeding window

30:04.460 --> 30:08.940
 is because studies of this sort are actually quite demanding

30:08.940 --> 30:12.080
 to perform and require the constant presence

30:12.080 --> 30:14.700
 of the graduate student or postdoc there

30:14.700 --> 30:18.140
 to ensure that the food is in the cages at particular times

30:18.140 --> 30:20.260
 and not in the cages at other times.

30:20.260 --> 30:22.100
 And mice are really good at hiding food.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.060
 They'll even hide food in their jowls.

30:25.380 --> 30:27.420
 And so there's a lot of work that has to be done

30:27.420 --> 30:29.620
 to prepare for that eight hour feeding window

30:29.620 --> 30:32.680
 and to make sure after that eight hour feeding window,

30:32.680 --> 30:35.020
 there's all the food has been removed from the cage

30:35.020 --> 30:37.060
 and from the jowls of the mice and so forth.

30:37.060 --> 30:39.780
 And it turns out that the significant other

30:39.780 --> 30:42.420
 of the graduate student and or postdoc,

30:42.420 --> 30:45.220
 I won't reveal who they were running this study,

30:45.220 --> 30:48.940
 forbid their significant other, the scientist,

30:48.940 --> 30:52.060
 from being in the lab for periods of time

30:52.060 --> 30:54.220
 that were much longer than the 10 or 12 hours

30:54.220 --> 30:56.500
 that were required in order to ensure

30:56.500 --> 30:58.140
 this eight hour feeding window.

30:58.140 --> 31:01.120
 So when we hear the eight hour feeding windows are holy,

31:01.120 --> 31:02.140
 they are not holy.

31:02.140 --> 31:06.540
 And later we are going to talk about how eating for a time

31:06.540 --> 31:08.620
 that's restricted to eight hours versus 10 hours

31:08.620 --> 31:10.860
 versus 12 hours, for instance,

31:10.860 --> 31:14.300
 how that impacts various parameters like health parameters

31:14.300 --> 31:15.300
 and weight loss, et cetera.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.740
 But the eight hour feeding window was actually created

31:17.740 --> 31:20.100
 because of a real world constraint on the research

31:20.100 --> 31:21.820
 and the relationship with the researcher

31:21.820 --> 31:22.940
 performing the research,

31:22.940 --> 31:24.560
 not because there's anything holy

31:24.560 --> 31:26.460
 about an eight hour feeding window.

31:26.460 --> 31:29.940
 Now, an important point about when the feeding window falls

31:29.940 --> 31:31.900
 within the 24 hour cycle,

31:31.900 --> 31:34.900
 it is very important that the feeding window fall

31:34.900 --> 31:38.920
 during the more active phase of one's day.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.860
 So for humans, that's typically in the early part of the day

31:42.860 --> 31:45.540
 or the later part of the day, but not at night.

31:45.540 --> 31:48.500
 Put very simply, there are a lot of data now

31:48.500 --> 31:53.040
 pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase

31:53.040 --> 31:57.980
 of the 24 hour cycle is very detrimental to one's health.

31:57.980 --> 32:02.360
 In fact, when we eat can either enhance our health

32:02.360 --> 32:04.840
 or can diminish our health.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.840
 When we see light can enhance our feelings of wellbeing

32:08.840 --> 32:10.540
 or can diminish our feelings of wellbeing.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.160
 I've talked many times before about this

32:12.160 --> 32:14.380
 on the Huberman Lab podcast that during the daytime,

32:14.380 --> 32:16.320
 you want to get as much sunlight

32:16.320 --> 32:17.980
 and other types of bright light in your eyes

32:17.980 --> 32:19.300
 as is safely possible.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.100
 And then you want to avoid light

32:21.100 --> 32:22.340
 in the middle of the night.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.940
 It has detrimental dopamine lowering effects,

32:24.940 --> 32:27.860
 can cause depression, cortisol increases, et cetera.

32:27.860 --> 32:30.240
 So when you view light is as important

32:30.240 --> 32:33.140
 as the light that you view and when you eat

32:33.140 --> 32:37.020
 is as important as what you eat.

32:37.020 --> 32:40.500
 In this study, they saw something really interesting,

32:40.500 --> 32:43.820
 which was that not only did restricting food

32:43.820 --> 32:46.460
 to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle

32:46.460 --> 32:51.000
 benefit things like lean body mass and fat loss

32:51.000 --> 32:52.340
 and a number of health parameters

32:52.340 --> 32:53.860
 that I'll talk about in a moment,

32:53.860 --> 32:57.900
 but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body

32:57.900 --> 33:00.300
 and provided a more regular stable

33:00.300 --> 33:03.060
 so-called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm.

33:03.060 --> 33:06.100
 You may be surprised to learn that 80%,

33:06.100 --> 33:10.240
 80% of the genes in your body and brain

33:11.180 --> 33:13.820
 are on a 24 hour schedule.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.980
 That is they change their levels going from high to low

33:16.980 --> 33:19.900
 and back to high again across the 24 hour cycle.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.740
 And when those genes are high at the appropriate times

33:22.740 --> 33:24.220
 and low at the appropriate times,

33:24.220 --> 33:26.560
 meaning their expression is high and low

33:26.560 --> 33:28.060
 at the appropriate times,

33:28.060 --> 33:31.300
 and therefore the proper RNAs and proteins are made

33:31.300 --> 33:32.740
 because DNA encodes for RNA,

33:32.740 --> 33:34.540
 RNA is translated into proteins.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.840
 When that happens, your health benefits.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.940
 When those genes are not expressed at the right times,

33:42.940 --> 33:45.380
 when they're high or low at the wrong times

33:45.380 --> 33:46.700
 of each 24 hour cycle,

33:46.700 --> 33:48.920
 that's when you get negative health effects.

33:49.860 --> 33:52.260
 This study showed that when mice restrict their eating

33:52.260 --> 33:56.140
 to an eight hour period within the most active phase

33:56.140 --> 33:57.600
 of their 24 hour cycle,

33:58.620 --> 34:00.420
 many of the genes that are associated

34:00.420 --> 34:02.420
 with these so-called circadian and clocks,

34:02.420 --> 34:06.640
 these genes have names like per, bmal, cry1, et cetera.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.560
 Those so-called clock genes underwent

34:09.560 --> 34:11.820
 a very regular entrainment,

34:11.820 --> 34:15.220
 a locking in to the proper 24 hour schedule.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.540
 And while this was in mice,

34:16.540 --> 34:19.740
 we now know that this also occurs in humans.

34:19.740 --> 34:22.220
 I've said before on this podcast, and I'll say it again,

34:22.220 --> 34:25.180
 that light and when we view light is the primary way

34:25.180 --> 34:28.020
 in which these genes and the clock systems of our body

34:28.020 --> 34:29.860
 get organized or entrained,

34:29.860 --> 34:32.300
 meaning matched to the outside light dark cycle.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.740
 So viewing light early in the day and in the afternoon

34:34.740 --> 34:36.900
 and as much as possible all day, great.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.260
 Ideally that sunlight avoiding light in the middle

34:39.260 --> 34:40.680
 of the night is also great.

34:42.100 --> 34:45.620
 It's great because it causes the increases

34:45.620 --> 34:47.900
 in particular genes and the decreases in particular genes

34:47.900 --> 34:49.240
 in every cell throughout your body

34:49.240 --> 34:51.040
 at the appropriate times.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.300
 The second most powerful timekeeper or zeitgeber

34:54.300 --> 34:58.660
 as it's called is food and when you eat.

34:58.660 --> 35:02.620
 And in this study, the results they saw underscore

35:02.620 --> 35:04.680
 this point, what they saw is that the peaks

35:04.680 --> 35:07.780
 in these clock genes became very regular

35:07.780 --> 35:10.580
 and the dips in these clock genes became very regular.

35:10.580 --> 35:13.460
 And that led to a whole host

35:13.460 --> 35:16.800
 of really important positive health effects.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.660
 Conversely, when mice ate whenever they wanted

35:19.660 --> 35:21.500
 across the 24 hour cycle,

35:21.500 --> 35:24.160
 these clock genes became really out of whack

35:24.160 --> 35:26.860
 and the negative health consequences

35:26.860 --> 35:30.220
 were the downstream result of these changes

35:30.220 --> 35:31.400
 in these clock genes.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.100
 This has now also been shown to be true for humans.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.100
 So if you want to be healthy, you want your organ health,

35:38.100 --> 35:42.400
 your metabolic health to be entrained properly.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.420
 One of the most important things you can do is to view light

35:44.420 --> 35:46.440
 at the appropriate times of each 24 hour schedule

35:46.440 --> 35:49.060
 and to not view light at other times of that schedule.

35:49.060 --> 35:53.720
 And to eat at the appropriate time of each 24 hour day.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.420
 Now, again, there are rare instances

35:55.420 --> 35:58.180
 that we will discuss when skipping entire days

35:58.180 --> 36:01.940
 or entire 24 hour cycles of eating can be beneficial.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.340
 But for now, we're talking about schedules

36:04.340 --> 36:07.220
 of time restricted feeding that involve a window

36:07.220 --> 36:09.540
 of feeding that falls during your more active phase.

36:09.540 --> 36:12.500
 So during the daytime, putting aside people

36:12.500 --> 36:14.360
 that work shift work during the daytime

36:14.360 --> 36:15.920
 is when you want to eat.

36:15.920 --> 36:20.100
 And this eight hour feeding window provided a very strong

36:20.100 --> 36:23.620
 reinforcing signal that combines with light

36:23.620 --> 36:25.300
 to ensure that these genes are expressed

36:25.300 --> 36:27.120
 at the appropriate times.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.700
 The short takeaway from this is you probably want

36:29.700 --> 36:32.340
 to think about and perhaps even engage

36:32.340 --> 36:34.240
 in time restricted feeding.

36:34.240 --> 36:35.320
 So as I mentioned earlier,

36:35.320 --> 36:38.360
 when mice can eat around the clock, bad things happen.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.900
 And one of the bad things that happens

36:39.900 --> 36:42.580
 is that the liver suffers.

36:42.580 --> 36:45.260
 The liver is involved in all sorts of things,

36:45.260 --> 36:46.620
 production of important hormones

36:46.620 --> 36:49.660
 and other factors related to metabolism.

36:49.660 --> 36:51.820
 And when mice can eat around the clock,

36:51.820 --> 36:55.520
 their livers got very sick, fatty deposits in the liver,

36:55.520 --> 36:56.920
 other factors in the liver,

36:56.920 --> 37:00.020
 essentially taking down the pathway of liver disease.

37:00.020 --> 37:03.480
 The time restricted feeding essentially reversed that

37:03.480 --> 37:06.760
 or led in many cases to even healthier liver conditions.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.800
 And that's based on this study,

37:07.800 --> 37:11.640
 but also additional studies also now in humans.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.180
 So restricting your feeding to a particular window

37:14.180 --> 37:16.980
 every 24 hour cycle has clearly been shown now

37:16.980 --> 37:20.860
 in mice and in humans to enhance liver health,

37:20.860 --> 37:21.860
 which is wonderful.

37:23.020 --> 37:24.220
 How does it do this?

37:24.220 --> 37:27.540
 Well, it happens because food intake,

37:27.540 --> 37:28.480
 as I mentioned earlier,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.540
 sets certain conditions in the body

37:30.540 --> 37:32.760
 that lasts for a period of time.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.140
 Anytime we eat, whether or not we are a mouse or a human,

37:36.140 --> 37:38.080
 there's a period of time that's required

37:38.080 --> 37:39.820
 for so-called digestion,

37:39.820 --> 37:43.240
 but also gastric emptying and other processes related

37:43.240 --> 37:45.660
 to breaking down that food and utilizing it.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.340
 And that is an active process.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.280
 It requires energy.

37:49.280 --> 37:53.780
 And that process of breaking down food

37:53.780 --> 37:55.980
 involves certain cellular functions

37:55.980 --> 37:59.620
 that if they're ongoing throughout the 24 hour cycle

37:59.620 --> 38:04.080
 or even extended too far across the 24 hour cycle,

38:04.080 --> 38:06.740
 meaning you're eating across a 14 or a 16 hour

38:06.740 --> 38:10.140
 and 18 hour window that causes serious problems.

38:10.140 --> 38:13.880
 And this has now been established because of the fact

38:13.880 --> 38:17.580
 that it increases the expression of different proteins

38:17.580 --> 38:21.020
 and genes in the body, such as TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1.

38:21.020 --> 38:22.260
 What are all those things?

38:22.260 --> 38:24.500
 They are pro-inflammatory markers.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.420
 So the reason that the liver gets sick

38:26.420 --> 38:28.180
 when you're eating too often

38:28.180 --> 38:31.440
 is because inflammatory markers are increased.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.140
 These inflammatory markers are not inherently bad.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.620
 They're there for a reason,

38:35.620 --> 38:38.060
 but they are there in order to respond

38:38.060 --> 38:40.580
 to certain challenges, immune challenges,

38:40.580 --> 38:42.900
 or the ingestion of food and the breakdown of food.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.900
 But then in an ideal circumstance,

38:45.900 --> 38:48.520
 they are reduced in the period

38:48.520 --> 38:51.340
 in which there's no food present in the digestive tract

38:51.340 --> 38:53.020
 or in which there's very little food present

38:53.020 --> 38:54.380
 in the digestive tract.

38:54.380 --> 38:55.860
 So by eating around the clock,

38:55.860 --> 38:57.300
 you're making yourself sicker.

38:57.300 --> 39:01.060
 By eating at restricted periods of time each 24 hour day,

39:01.060 --> 39:02.900
 you're actually making yourself healthier

39:02.900 --> 39:06.140
 and you're activating certain processes

39:06.140 --> 39:09.860
 that can positively impact both weight,

39:09.860 --> 39:11.700
 either maintenance or loss of weight.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.340
 We'll talk about weight gain a little later

39:13.340 --> 39:16.020
 and positively impacting things like liver health.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.420
 Also the expression of different things

39:18.420 --> 39:20.020
 related to brown fat,

39:20.020 --> 39:21.780
 the fat that increases your metabolism.

39:21.780 --> 39:24.180
 We will return to this also a little bit later

39:24.180 --> 39:27.260
 and blood glucose regulation.

39:27.260 --> 39:29.460
 So the takeaway from this study,

39:29.460 --> 39:31.100
 in fact, there are many takeaways from this study.

39:31.100 --> 39:35.380
 It's so wonderful is that liver health,

39:35.380 --> 39:38.220
 bile acid metabolism, energy expenditure,

39:38.220 --> 39:42.540
 inflammation, liver metabolites,

39:42.540 --> 39:44.900
 many, many aspects of our health

39:44.900 --> 39:48.300
 are impacted by when we eat, not just what we eat.

39:48.300 --> 39:51.260
 As we move forward and we talk about intermittent fasting

39:51.260 --> 39:53.460
 for eight hour windows, six hour windows,

39:53.460 --> 39:56.100
 12 hour windows for all sorts of different

39:56.100 --> 39:57.660
 intents and purposes,

39:57.660 --> 40:01.380
 I want to start to establish a foundational protocol

40:01.380 --> 40:04.480
 that all of us, any of us can use

40:04.480 --> 40:07.840
 in order to maximize your particular goals.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.700
 There are some absolutes within this realm

40:10.700 --> 40:12.740
 of time restricted feeding.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.360
 Here are a couple of absolutes

40:14.360 --> 40:15.740
 that you would want to consider.

40:15.740 --> 40:20.740
 First of all, it pays off in the metabolic sense

40:21.220 --> 40:22.620
 and in the health sense

40:22.620 --> 40:25.960
 and in the weight maintenance or loss sense

40:25.960 --> 40:30.380
 to not ingest any food in the first hour after waking

40:31.380 --> 40:32.980
 and potentially for longer.

40:32.980 --> 40:33.900
 So I want to repeat that.

40:33.900 --> 40:36.420
 One of the key pillars of intermittent fasting

40:36.420 --> 40:39.540
 is that for the first hour after you wake up

40:39.540 --> 40:43.980
 and potentially for longer to not ingest any food, okay?

40:43.980 --> 40:47.740
 The second major pillar that's well supported by research

40:47.740 --> 40:51.380
 is that for the two and ideally three hours

40:51.380 --> 40:52.940
 prior to bedtime,

40:52.940 --> 40:55.860
 you also don't ingest any food

40:55.860 --> 40:57.580
 or liquid calories for that matter.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.740
 And we will talk about what it means to break a fast

41:00.740 --> 41:02.380
 and whether or not certain liquids,

41:02.380 --> 41:04.740
 even coffee and tea can break a fast, et cetera,

41:04.740 --> 41:05.580
 in a few moments.

41:05.580 --> 41:08.560
 But just as a foundation,

41:08.560 --> 41:10.980
 it's very clear from the research in humans

41:10.980 --> 41:14.260
 that not eating any food or ingesting any calories,

41:14.260 --> 41:15.580
 liquid or otherwise,

41:15.580 --> 41:19.500
 for the first 60 minutes after waking up each day

41:19.500 --> 41:23.860
 and for the two to three hours prior to your bedtime,

41:23.860 --> 41:26.540
 that's ideal for the parameters

41:26.540 --> 41:27.780
 that we've discussed earlier,

41:27.780 --> 41:30.120
 all the different things like weight and liver health

41:30.120 --> 41:32.320
 and metabolic health and so forth.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.900
 The two most common questions about intermittent fasting

41:34.900 --> 41:38.060
 are when is the ideal time for the eating window?

41:38.060 --> 41:39.560
 Is it early in the day, the middle of the day,

41:39.560 --> 41:41.140
 or late or in the day?

41:41.140 --> 41:43.900
 And how long should that eating window be?

41:43.900 --> 41:45.180
 Should it be eight hours?

41:45.180 --> 41:47.320
 We already heard why the eight hour window

41:47.320 --> 41:48.700
 was first established.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.280
 It was because of these lab conditions

41:50.280 --> 41:52.320
 and the conditions of the particular relationship

41:52.320 --> 41:54.020
 of the graduate student involved,

41:54.020 --> 41:57.180
 or should it be seven hours or six hours or 12 hours?

41:57.180 --> 41:59.900
 Turns out that there's some general frameworks

41:59.900 --> 42:03.020
 that we can follow in order to answer these questions.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.080
 As we move into this portion of the discussion,

42:05.080 --> 42:07.940
 I want to highlight a very important reference

42:07.940 --> 42:11.340
 that just came out, literally came out last week

42:11.340 --> 42:14.020
 in the journal, endocrinology reviews.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.960
 And the title of this review is time restricted eating

42:16.960 --> 42:20.500
 for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases.

42:20.500 --> 42:23.140
 Although the data in this paper

42:23.140 --> 42:25.060
 go well beyond metabolic diseases.

42:25.060 --> 42:27.860
 This is a paper from Sachin Panda's lab.

42:27.860 --> 42:31.540
 It's a very lengthy review with an enormous table

42:31.540 --> 42:33.300
 that's beautifully organized,

42:33.300 --> 42:37.500
 that scripts out all the studies done in humans,

42:37.500 --> 42:39.540
 well over a hundred studies,

42:39.540 --> 42:41.860
 looking at time restricted feeding in athletes,

42:41.860 --> 42:45.420
 men, women, children, diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,

42:45.420 --> 42:48.780
 with detailed references and description of the outcomes.

42:48.780 --> 42:50.460
 Spent a lot of time with this review,

42:50.460 --> 42:52.100
 even though it just came out recently,

42:52.100 --> 42:55.020
 and is a absolute goldmine resource.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.500
 It is also the major resource

42:56.500 --> 42:58.000
 for everything I'm about to tell you

42:58.000 --> 43:00.820
 if you would like to delve deeper into the material.

43:00.820 --> 43:02.940
 So let's deal with this first question

43:02.940 --> 43:05.500
 of when is the ideal feeding window?

43:05.500 --> 43:08.960
 And here again, we're thinking about a schedule of eating

43:08.960 --> 43:12.100
 that involves eating at least once every 24 hours,

43:12.100 --> 43:15.060
 not two day or three day or every other day fast.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.600
 So it turns out that the answer to the question,

43:18.600 --> 43:22.140
 when is it best to eat, is actually best answered

43:22.140 --> 43:24.260
 by thinking about the other side of the coin,

43:24.260 --> 43:27.100
 which is when is it best to fast?

43:27.100 --> 43:30.660
 So because we are fasting during sleep,

43:30.660 --> 43:33.680
 it's very clear that it's best to extend

43:33.680 --> 43:38.220
 the sleep-related fast either into the morning

43:38.220 --> 43:41.080
 or to start it in the evening.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.540
 Now, this might seem kind of obvious,

43:42.540 --> 43:45.260
 but it's actually not so obvious.

43:45.260 --> 43:48.460
 You could place that feeding window early in the day,

43:48.460 --> 43:50.620
 middle of the day, or late in the day.

43:50.620 --> 43:53.020
 Let's think about what happens when we sleep.

43:53.020 --> 43:56.140
 When we sleep, our body undergoes a number

43:56.140 --> 43:58.660
 of different processes in the brain and body

43:58.660 --> 44:01.700
 in order to recover the cells and tissues.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.580
 Many of you have probably heard of autophagy,

44:03.580 --> 44:06.560
 which is essentially a cleaning up, a gobbling up

44:06.560 --> 44:09.500
 of dead cells and cells that are injured or sick.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.680
 And this is a natural process that occurs,

44:11.680 --> 44:13.460
 and it occurs mainly during sleep,

44:13.460 --> 44:15.400
 although not only during sleep.

44:17.100 --> 44:21.380
 Fasting of any kind does tend to enhance autophagy.

44:21.380 --> 44:26.380
 It is not the only way to create autophagic conditions.

44:26.420 --> 44:28.740
 Autophagic conditions can be created simply

44:28.740 --> 44:30.660
 by following a sub caloric diet.

44:30.660 --> 44:32.540
 And there are other things that one can do

44:32.540 --> 44:34.820
 in order to trigger autophagy,

44:34.820 --> 44:36.820
 but fasting does trigger autophagy.

44:36.820 --> 44:38.260
 So when we're asleep,

44:38.260 --> 44:40.980
 the bad cells are getting gobbled up and eaten,

44:40.980 --> 44:43.880
 and the good cells also are undergoing

44:43.880 --> 44:46.420
 certain repair mechanisms mainly related to,

44:46.420 --> 44:48.860
 or at least governed by those circadian genes

44:48.860 --> 44:51.460
 that we talked about earlier, those clock genes.

44:51.460 --> 44:54.620
 So you're already fasting when you're asleep.

44:54.620 --> 44:57.960
 And how deep you are into that fast depends

44:57.960 --> 45:01.000
 on how long it was since your last meal.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.220
 So if you fast early in the day

45:04.220 --> 45:08.380
 and you've been asleep for five, six, seven, eight hours,

45:08.380 --> 45:10.400
 I would hope somewhere between six and eight hours

45:10.400 --> 45:12.860
 for most people is going to be beneficial.

45:12.860 --> 45:15.560
 When you wake up, I mentioned earlier

45:15.560 --> 45:16.580
 that you don't want to eat

45:16.580 --> 45:19.200
 for at least the first 60 minutes after waking,

45:19.200 --> 45:24.200
 but were you to extend that fasting to say 9 AM, 10 AM,

45:24.200 --> 45:27.220
 11 AM, or even 12 noon or later,

45:27.220 --> 45:29.740
 you are taking advantage of the deep fast

45:29.740 --> 45:31.940
 that you were in during sleep

45:31.940 --> 45:33.540
 and certainly toward the end of sleep.

45:33.540 --> 45:34.920
 Now, why do I say deep fast?

45:34.920 --> 45:38.860
 Well, because when we eat,

45:38.860 --> 45:40.860
 the clearance of that food from our gut

45:40.860 --> 45:44.420
 and the processes in our cells and organs

45:44.420 --> 45:46.300
 that are related to digestion

45:46.300 --> 45:48.080
 and the utilization of that food

45:49.040 --> 45:51.460
 takes about five to six hours.

45:51.460 --> 45:55.680
 So if you eat a meal and that meal lasts 10 minutes,

45:55.680 --> 45:57.900
 20 minutes, or 30 minutes, or even an hour,

45:57.900 --> 46:00.500
 and then you stop eating, you've stopped eating,

46:00.500 --> 46:03.220
 but you are not fasting at that point.

46:03.220 --> 46:04.240
 You can say you're fasting

46:04.240 --> 46:05.640
 because you're no longer putting food

46:05.640 --> 46:07.500
 into your digestive tract,

46:07.500 --> 46:09.460
 but you are not in a fasted state.

46:09.460 --> 46:12.420
 You are not under conditions of fasting.

46:12.420 --> 46:13.840
 Later, I'll talk about things that you can do

46:13.840 --> 46:16.380
 to accelerate the transition into fasting.

46:16.380 --> 46:20.120
 So one thing is certain that you want your eating window

46:20.120 --> 46:25.120
 to be tacked or attached to your sleep-based fasting

46:25.580 --> 46:28.260
 in a way that makes it easier for you

46:28.260 --> 46:31.300
 to get into the fasted state for a period of time.

46:31.300 --> 46:33.140
 So we can view that point

46:33.140 --> 46:38.140
 from the perspective of best, better, and worst, okay?

46:39.300 --> 46:42.460
 So if you are like most people and you sleep at night,

46:42.460 --> 46:44.700
 you're waking up somewhere around 6.37 AM

46:44.700 --> 46:45.900
 or maybe even 8 AM,

46:45.900 --> 46:49.180
 let's say you were to push your fasting window out

46:49.180 --> 46:52.640
 such that you started eating at noon

46:53.500 --> 46:56.560
 and then you stopped eating at 6 PM.

46:57.700 --> 47:01.000
 Well, then you're not eating from 6 PM

47:01.000 --> 47:03.020
 until let's say your bedtime is 10 PM,

47:03.020 --> 47:04.580
 but from 6 PM to 10 PM,

47:04.580 --> 47:07.120
 your body is not yet in a fasted state

47:07.120 --> 47:08.180
 because you just ate.

47:09.140 --> 47:12.440
 However, you're starting to taper into a fasted state

47:12.440 --> 47:15.020
 before sleep and then all through sleep

47:15.020 --> 47:17.740
 and until the next morning and late morning,

47:17.740 --> 47:20.100
 you are actually in a fasted state.

47:20.100 --> 47:21.820
 Now, most people find it very hard

47:21.820 --> 47:24.060
 to only eat in the middle of the day.

47:24.060 --> 47:25.360
 So while that's best,

47:25.360 --> 47:28.780
 it's ideal for sake of the fasting-related improvements

47:28.780 --> 47:31.020
 in health, it is not ideal

47:31.020 --> 47:33.860
 and it's not very applicable

47:33.860 --> 47:37.260
 to most work and family and social situations.

47:37.260 --> 47:39.460
 Most people eat breakfast with others

47:39.460 --> 47:41.880
 and or eat dinner with others.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.500
 Some people eat lunch with others,

47:43.500 --> 47:46.260
 but in general, it's hard to restrict your feeding window

47:46.260 --> 47:48.340
 to just the absolute middle of the day.

47:48.340 --> 47:50.480
 But from a purely health perspective,

47:50.480 --> 47:54.060
 in a very objective way, that would be the ideal situation.

47:54.060 --> 47:56.260
 Let's imagine a different pattern of eating

47:56.260 --> 47:59.620
 where the feeding window starts in the afternoon,

47:59.620 --> 48:02.100
 starts around two or even 3 PM.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.540
 Some people don't have much trouble

48:03.540 --> 48:06.500
 or they can train themselves to get their feeding window

48:06.500 --> 48:08.620
 out to two or 3 PM

48:08.620 --> 48:11.540
 and then they will eat until 10 or 11 PM, right?

48:11.540 --> 48:12.380
 If you do the math,

48:12.380 --> 48:14.660
 you realize that that feeding window is still pretty short.

48:14.660 --> 48:17.540
 It still constitutes what we would call intermittent fasting

48:17.540 --> 48:19.340
 or time restricted feeding.

48:19.340 --> 48:23.180
 But assuming that they go to bed around 11 PM or midnight,

48:24.460 --> 48:26.960
 they are not actually fasted in sleep

48:26.960 --> 48:30.380
 because for the first six hours or so of sleep,

48:30.380 --> 48:32.860
 maybe five, but probably more like six hours of sleep,

48:32.860 --> 48:34.180
 they're still digesting the food

48:34.180 --> 48:36.700
 that they consumed late in the night.

48:36.700 --> 48:41.340
 It does appear beneficial to grab ahold of

48:41.340 --> 48:43.980
 that sleep related fast,

48:43.980 --> 48:47.540
 meaning you don't want your feeding window

48:47.540 --> 48:48.700
 to be too close to bedtime.

48:48.700 --> 48:50.140
 And that's why we came up with this

48:50.140 --> 48:52.160
 kind of foundational pillar

48:52.160 --> 48:53.860
 that I discussed with Sachin earlier,

48:53.860 --> 48:57.420
 which is at least no eating for the first hour after waking,

48:57.420 --> 49:01.680
 but also no eating within two to three hours prior to bed.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.840
 And because we all need to sleep

49:02.840 --> 49:04.840
 and sleep is exceedingly important

49:04.840 --> 49:06.240
 for our health of all kinds,

49:07.460 --> 49:08.740
 you want to prioritize sleep,

49:08.740 --> 49:10.520
 but because we also have to eat,

49:10.520 --> 49:11.780
 then you start to think about this

49:11.780 --> 49:13.460
 and maybe it's not so good

49:13.460 --> 49:16.260
 to push that feeding window too late in the day,

49:16.260 --> 49:17.780
 because when you go to sleep,

49:17.780 --> 49:19.320
 you're not actually capitalizing

49:19.320 --> 49:21.220
 on the sleep related fasting.

49:21.220 --> 49:22.820
 Now it's not just the case

49:22.820 --> 49:24.720
 that it's easiest to fast while in sleep,

49:24.720 --> 49:26.540
 although that's true because when we're asleep,

49:26.540 --> 49:28.940
 typically we're not hungry or looking for food

49:28.940 --> 49:30.560
 or foraging for food or wanting food

49:30.560 --> 49:32.860
 or trying to resist food, we're just sleeping.

49:33.980 --> 49:36.240
 There is something special about the fasting

49:36.240 --> 49:39.260
 that occurs during sleep because it's associated

49:39.260 --> 49:40.820
 with a number of processes

49:40.820 --> 49:43.420
 that relate to the so-called glymphatic system,

49:43.420 --> 49:45.900
 the movement of lymph-like fluids

49:45.900 --> 49:47.340
 and other fluids through the brain

49:47.340 --> 49:50.580
 are kind of sweeping out a garbage disposal, if you will,

49:50.580 --> 49:53.020
 a clearing out of the metabolic debris

49:53.020 --> 49:55.260
 and some of the autophagy that's associated

49:55.260 --> 49:58.660
 with bad processes in the brain.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.300
 So we could do a whole episode on this,

50:00.300 --> 50:01.740
 but essentially during sleep

50:01.740 --> 50:05.260
 and in particular during fasted states of sleep,

50:05.260 --> 50:09.660
 we are undergoing a number of automatic cellular processes

50:09.660 --> 50:11.900
 that clear out debris from our brain,

50:11.900 --> 50:14.680
 enhance cognition, or at least offset dementia,

50:14.680 --> 50:16.280
 this is now well-established,

50:16.280 --> 50:17.900
 as well as a number of the same processes

50:17.900 --> 50:19.860
 occurring in the organs of our body.

50:19.860 --> 50:22.160
 So what we're starting to see here

50:22.160 --> 50:23.600
 is that there are a number of constraints

50:23.600 --> 50:24.940
 on when you can eat.

50:24.940 --> 50:27.580
 Now I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge

50:27.580 --> 50:30.120
 the social constraints and the real life constraints.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.740
 Some of us, because we want to eat with our family

50:32.740 --> 50:35.700
 and because our family or our significant others

50:35.700 --> 50:37.120
 eat around eight or 9 p.m.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.320
 and that's the only time we're together,

50:38.320 --> 50:40.580
 you have to eat late in the day.

50:40.580 --> 50:41.900
 And that's certainly not a sin.

50:41.900 --> 50:44.000
 I'm not saying that's good or bad.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.900
 Here we're trying to establish, if you recall,

50:45.900 --> 50:48.020
 best, better, and worst.

50:48.020 --> 50:52.020
 So from both a practical and a health perspective

50:52.020 --> 50:53.780
 and a purely objective view

50:53.780 --> 50:58.200
 of how intermittent fasting works and can benefit us,

50:58.200 --> 51:03.200
 starting to eat each day somewhere around 10 a.m.

51:03.220 --> 51:07.240
 or around noon, and then allowing a feeding window

51:07.240 --> 51:11.560
 that goes until six or maybe 8 p.m.,

51:11.560 --> 51:14.780
 that seems to me, at least based on the data

51:14.780 --> 51:17.080
 and what I understand about typical cultures

51:17.080 --> 51:20.360
 where people eat in the daytime and in the evening,

51:22.200 --> 51:24.180
 that seems to me like the kind of schedule

51:24.180 --> 51:26.260
 that will allow you to get the most

51:26.260 --> 51:28.900
 out of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,

51:29.900 --> 51:32.940
 but does not set you up to be really out of sync

51:32.940 --> 51:35.460
 with the social rhythms in most cultures.

51:36.380 --> 51:38.820
 If you think about it from the perspective of say,

51:38.820 --> 51:42.220
 a noon to eight feeding window,

51:42.220 --> 51:44.460
 what you'll find is that you're able to eat lunch

51:44.460 --> 51:47.500
 with others, if you like, or by yourself,

51:47.500 --> 51:50.420
 you will be able to eat dinner at a reasonable hour,

51:50.420 --> 51:52.220
 at least in most countries, in most cultures,

51:52.220 --> 51:56.180
 eating dinner somewhere between 6.30 and 7 p.m.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.900
 is typical.

51:59.100 --> 52:01.340
 When you say a feeding window that goes until eight,

52:01.340 --> 52:03.940
 that doesn't mean sitting down to dinner at eight.

52:03.940 --> 52:06.180
 That means your last bite of food or ingestion

52:06.180 --> 52:08.660
 of any liquid calories was at 8 p.m.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.380
 Assuming that you go to bed somewhere between 10 p.m.

52:12.380 --> 52:14.920
 and 1 a.m., that allows this tapering off

52:14.920 --> 52:18.380
 or this transition from feeding to a fasted state

52:18.380 --> 52:21.980
 and still allows you to capitalize on the special period

52:21.980 --> 52:24.900
 of fasting that is sleep-related fasting.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.700
 And again, I want to emphasize that the fasting

52:26.700 --> 52:28.460
 that occurs during sleep is vital

52:28.460 --> 52:31.200
 and eating too close to sleep will disrupt

52:31.200 --> 52:33.620
 that fasting-related sleep.

52:33.620 --> 52:35.500
 Now, there are a number of caveats

52:35.500 --> 52:37.440
 and details related to this,

52:37.440 --> 52:40.660
 and there's an important caveat and detail related

52:40.660 --> 52:43.160
 to people that are specifically interested

52:43.160 --> 52:46.900
 in increasing or maintaining muscle mass.

52:46.900 --> 52:51.660
 So first let's talk about food volume and food type

52:51.660 --> 52:55.660
 and how that relates to whether or not you quickly

52:55.660 --> 52:58.180
 or slowly enter a fasted state,

52:58.180 --> 53:01.760
 because clearly when we talk about a feeding window,

53:01.760 --> 53:03.440
 that feeding window could include any number

53:03.440 --> 53:04.280
 of different foods.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.180
 It could involve cake and ice cream, pizza, hamburgers,

53:07.180 --> 53:09.720
 plants, fruit, whatever it is,

53:09.720 --> 53:14.020
 or it could involve just fats or just proteins, et cetera.

53:14.020 --> 53:16.340
 There are at least three factors that are going

53:16.340 --> 53:18.680
 to govern how quickly you transition

53:18.680 --> 53:22.040
 from ingesting food to a fasted state.

53:22.040 --> 53:26.940
 Remember, as you ingest your last bite or sip of calories,

53:26.940 --> 53:28.460
 that's not when the fast begins.

53:28.460 --> 53:31.260
 That might be when the fasting begins on your watch

53:31.260 --> 53:33.220
 or on one of these apps that I'll refer to later,

53:33.220 --> 53:35.700
 which can help you track your fasting and eating windows,

53:35.700 --> 53:37.920
 but that's not when it actually begins

53:37.920 --> 53:40.180
 because your body is still seeing food.

53:40.180 --> 53:43.100
 You're actually carrying around food inside of you.

53:43.100 --> 53:45.180
 Even though you're not putting it into your mouth,

53:45.180 --> 53:47.940
 you're still eating in some sense.

53:47.940 --> 53:51.260
 So it should be somewhat obvious that very large meals

53:51.260 --> 53:53.740
 are going to take longer to digest than very small meals.

53:53.740 --> 53:58.060
 So that will impact how slowly or quickly you migrate

53:58.060 --> 54:00.880
 from a fed state to a fasted state.

54:01.820 --> 54:05.220
 There's no way I can spell out what exact volume of food

54:05.220 --> 54:07.260
 you should ingest based on the size of your stomach

54:07.260 --> 54:08.540
 and et cetera.

54:08.540 --> 54:11.520
 But you're all familiar with being extremely full,

54:11.520 --> 54:15.120
 very full, comfortably full, somewhat full,

54:15.120 --> 54:17.900
 or not feeling full and feeling hungry.

54:17.900 --> 54:21.660
 So learning to gauge food volume is important.

54:21.660 --> 54:25.820
 Also foods that include some fats or a lot of fats

54:25.820 --> 54:28.780
 will tend to slow gastric emptying time.

54:28.780 --> 54:31.580
 And depending on the kind of fats,

54:31.580 --> 54:33.740
 it could mean that a given meal is digested

54:33.740 --> 54:35.660
 within three hours versus five hours.

54:35.660 --> 54:38.420
 So more fats might be a large meal with a lot of fats

54:38.420 --> 54:39.940
 has been going to take five or six hours.

54:39.940 --> 54:42.100
 A smaller meal with less fat is going to be digested

54:42.100 --> 54:43.420
 more quickly.

54:43.420 --> 54:45.880
 Consuming calories in liquid form is going to mean

54:45.880 --> 54:48.380
 that gastric emptying time is going to be faster.

54:48.380 --> 54:49.260
 And then of course,

54:49.260 --> 54:51.960
 there's the glucose and the insulin aspect to it,

54:51.960 --> 54:55.540
 which is that foods that lead to big steep rises in glucose,

54:55.540 --> 54:59.020
 like pure sugars, then your glucose will drop.

54:59.020 --> 55:00.820
 However, if they're combined with fats,

55:00.820 --> 55:02.880
 then it tends to be a more gradual rise in glucose

55:02.880 --> 55:04.540
 and it's more sustained, et cetera.

55:04.540 --> 55:07.460
 Fibrous foods will also create a more long lasting

55:07.460 --> 55:09.440
 sustained release in glucose.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.540
 The important thing here is to establish a feeding window

55:14.540 --> 55:17.300
 that you can comfortably manage, okay?

55:17.300 --> 55:18.800
 Meaning that on average,

55:18.800 --> 55:21.840
 you can obey a six hour feeding window

55:21.840 --> 55:24.780
 or an eight hour feeding window or a 10 hour feeding window.

55:24.780 --> 55:28.540
 And then to place that feeding window in a social

55:28.540 --> 55:32.440
 and life context that you can manage on a regular basis.

55:32.440 --> 55:35.020
 Now there are two key points that have been gleaned

55:35.020 --> 55:37.900
 from the scientific data about this feeding window

55:37.900 --> 55:39.340
 and when to place it.

55:39.340 --> 55:42.140
 And this is based on a really important experiment

55:42.140 --> 55:44.100
 that Satchin and his colleagues have been doing.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.660
 There's a website that they have,

55:45.660 --> 55:48.300
 a zero cost website called My Circadian Clock.

55:48.300 --> 55:50.820
 You can go to this website free of cost.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.660
 There are a number of important resources there,

55:52.660 --> 55:55.280
 but what they've done is they've examined

55:55.280 --> 55:58.780
 the feeding behavior of thousands of people.

55:58.780 --> 56:01.160
 People will take a picture of the food they're about to eat

56:01.160 --> 56:03.040
 and it enters into their account,

56:03.040 --> 56:05.920
 maybe your account if you create one on My Circadian Clock.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.700
 And they do this over many days or weeks.

56:08.700 --> 56:11.820
 What's great about this is it establishes

56:11.820 --> 56:14.100
 what's essentially called a phytogram,

56:14.100 --> 56:16.500
 a time in which people ate.

56:16.500 --> 56:19.400
 And a number of important findings have emerged

56:19.400 --> 56:22.540
 from these phytograms across large populations

56:22.540 --> 56:24.060
 of people in different time zones

56:24.060 --> 56:25.460
 with different schedules, et cetera.

56:25.460 --> 56:29.900
 First of all, almost everybody underestimates

56:29.900 --> 56:31.040
 their feeding window.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.340
 Meaning people who think that they are

56:33.340 --> 56:37.580
 on an eight hour feeding window or six hour feeding window,

56:37.580 --> 56:41.000
 when their data are analyzed,

56:41.000 --> 56:42.300
 it almost is always the case

56:42.300 --> 56:43.780
 that they're actually on a feeding window

56:43.780 --> 56:46.860
 that's one or even two hours longer than they think.

56:46.860 --> 56:48.180
 You think, well, how could that possibly be?

56:48.180 --> 56:50.380
 If people are taking their first bite at noon

56:50.380 --> 56:53.380
 and they're taking their last bite at 8 p.m.,

56:53.380 --> 56:57.020
 well, that must mean that they are on that feeding window

56:57.020 --> 56:58.380
 of eight hours.

56:58.380 --> 57:01.620
 And it turns out that people cheat,

57:01.620 --> 57:03.460
 but they don't cheat in any kind of obvious way.

57:03.460 --> 57:06.420
 They might have, you know, a glass of wine after dinner,

57:06.420 --> 57:08.660
 or they'll have a cup of tea and a little bite of a cookie.

57:08.660 --> 57:10.780
 And so when people are honest and they are honest

57:10.780 --> 57:14.280
 in most cases for this experiment,

57:14.280 --> 57:16.020
 what you find is that most people's eating window

57:16.020 --> 57:17.160
 is actually quite a bit longer.

57:17.160 --> 57:18.660
 So in discussing this with Sachin

57:18.660 --> 57:20.560
 and reviewing the literature,

57:20.560 --> 57:22.380
 it's clear that if you'd like to be

57:22.380 --> 57:25.960
 on a 10 hour feeding window,

57:25.960 --> 57:29.540
 that you should probably select an eight hour feeding window

57:29.540 --> 57:32.400
 because there's always a little bit of a taper

57:32.400 --> 57:34.180
 on either side of that eating window.

57:34.180 --> 57:36.640
 Very few people are extremely strict

57:36.640 --> 57:37.560
 about these eating windows.

57:37.560 --> 57:39.800
 It's just hard to do in the context of life events

57:39.800 --> 57:43.300
 and social gatherings and family and so forth.

57:43.300 --> 57:47.020
 Okay, so as we build forward your ideal fasting

57:47.020 --> 57:49.820
 slash time restricted feeding schedule,

57:49.820 --> 57:52.980
 we now have several different rules that we can list out.

57:52.980 --> 57:57.060
 First, at least no food for the first hour after waking up,

57:57.060 --> 57:59.260
 at least one hour.

57:59.260 --> 58:03.300
 Two, no food intake for two

58:03.300 --> 58:06.220
 and ideally three hours prior to your bedtime.

58:06.220 --> 58:11.220
 Three, if you want to select an eight hour feeding window,

58:13.120 --> 58:14.660
 then you should probably focus

58:14.660 --> 58:16.280
 on a six or seven hour feeding window

58:16.280 --> 58:18.300
 because in reality your feeding window

58:18.300 --> 58:19.980
 is going to be longer.

58:19.980 --> 58:22.060
 Reality meaning real life constraints.

58:23.020 --> 58:25.740
 And if you'd like to be on a 10 hour feeding window,

58:25.740 --> 58:27.180
 you should probably select an eight

58:27.180 --> 58:28.740
 or a nine hour feeding window

58:28.740 --> 58:30.420
 because the way it plays out is that people

58:30.420 --> 58:34.620
 almost always eat outside of their eating window somewhat.

58:34.620 --> 58:36.380
 The other nice thing about selecting

58:36.380 --> 58:38.800
 a slightly shorter eating window

58:38.800 --> 58:40.420
 than is comfortable for you

58:40.420 --> 58:41.820
 is that it takes into account

58:41.820 --> 58:44.900
 that as you take your last bite

58:44.900 --> 58:46.520
 or your last sip of calories,

58:46.520 --> 58:49.300
 there's this time or taper

58:49.300 --> 58:52.120
 before which you are actually in a fasted state.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.780
 And because you're eating different things

58:53.780 --> 58:55.500
 on different days presumably,

58:55.500 --> 58:57.540
 some foods leave your gut more quickly,

58:57.540 --> 58:58.900
 some things spike your insulin

58:58.900 --> 59:01.140
 and your glucose more than others.

59:01.140 --> 59:04.620
 Sometimes you eat more fat, sometimes less fat.

59:04.620 --> 59:07.980
 This allows you to fall well within the margins

59:07.980 --> 59:10.220
 of the benefits of time restricted feeding

59:10.220 --> 59:11.900
 that have been demonstrated in humans,

59:11.900 --> 59:16.660
 which generally involve an eight hour window or so.

59:16.660 --> 59:18.600
 So I think this eight hour window

59:18.600 --> 59:20.700
 or six hour window is a good thing

59:20.700 --> 59:22.720
 to shoot for for most people.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.500
 Some people, and we will discuss the exceptions,

59:24.500 --> 59:26.980
 but some people truly are exceptions to this.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.400
 They just require more food.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.660
 And along those lines,

59:30.660 --> 59:32.740
 I just now briefly want to touch on some of the studies

59:32.740 --> 59:35.100
 that have looked at using a very short feeding window

59:35.100 --> 59:36.780
 of about four hours.

59:36.780 --> 59:38.400
 Nowadays, a number of people are doing

59:38.400 --> 59:39.980
 the so-called one meal per day

59:39.980 --> 59:42.140
 or are restricting their feeding window

59:42.140 --> 59:45.020
 to just four hours or six hours.

59:45.020 --> 59:48.320
 And that turns out to be an interesting strategy.

59:48.320 --> 59:51.340
 And the data around it actually are a little bit surprising.

59:51.340 --> 59:52.980
 One surprising thing to leap out

59:52.980 --> 59:55.740
 of this massive literature review

59:55.740 --> 59:58.060
 on time restricted feeding in humans

59:58.060 --> 1:00:01.440
 is that relatively short feeding windows

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:03.140
 of say four to six hours

1:00:03.140 --> 1:00:06.100
 do produce a number of positive health effects,

1:00:06.100 --> 1:00:08.300
 things like increased insulin sensitivity,

1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:09.540
 which we know is good.

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:11.660
 Remember type two diabetes is a reduction

1:00:11.660 --> 1:00:13.660
 in insulin sensitivity,

1:00:13.660 --> 1:00:16.700
 improvements in beta cell function and the pancreas,

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:18.100
 decreased blood pressure,

1:00:18.100 --> 1:00:19.780
 decreased oxidative stress,

1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:24.100
 decreases in things like evening appetite.

1:00:24.100 --> 1:00:25.540
 So positive health effects

1:00:25.540 --> 1:00:28.540
 and psychological effects in general.

1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:33.420
 However, they either produce no change in body weight

1:00:33.420 --> 1:00:37.700
 or they tend to produce even increases in body weight.

1:00:37.700 --> 1:00:40.240
 Now, of course, there's variation between individuals

1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:41.980
 and between studies,

1:00:41.980 --> 1:00:43.660
 but this is somewhat surprising.

1:00:43.660 --> 1:00:45.200
 So the eight hour feeding window

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:46.800
 seems to be very beneficial

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:49.940
 across almost all the parameters that we've discussed,

1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:52.300
 inflammation, weight loss, fat loss, et cetera.

1:00:53.420 --> 1:00:54.900
 And adherence, I should mention,

1:00:54.900 --> 1:00:56.700
 people's ability to stick to the diet

1:00:56.700 --> 1:01:00.000
 seems quite good on this eight hour feeding windows.

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.820
 But when people try and undergo

1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:04.860
 very short feeding windows of four to six hours,

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:06.520
 it seems that they are overeating

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:07.680
 in that four to six hours,

1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:11.860
 at least overeating with respect to their metabolic needs.

1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:15.780
 Now, the contrast to this

1:01:15.780 --> 1:01:18.360
 is the so-called one meal per day schedule.

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:20.820
 Very few studies on one meal per day.

1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:23.100
 One meal per day, unless it's a very, very long meal,

1:01:23.100 --> 1:01:24.160
 a sort of feast,

1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:26.740
 typically would not last four to six hours,

1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:28.820
 because it sort of depends on how you define a meal.

1:01:28.820 --> 1:01:31.300
 But when you look at the very few,

1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:32.140
 I should emphasize again,

1:01:32.140 --> 1:01:34.220
 very few studies on one meal per day,

1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:36.740
 people typically maintain or lose weight

1:01:36.740 --> 1:01:38.540
 on the one meal per day schedule.

1:01:38.540 --> 1:01:39.580
 So what we can say

1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:42.900
 is that the seven to nine hour feeding window

1:01:42.900 --> 1:01:45.740
 produces all of the major health benefits

1:01:45.740 --> 1:01:47.900
 of time-restricted feeding,

1:01:47.900 --> 1:01:49.780
 as well as being pretty straightforward

1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:52.940
 for most people to adhere to on a regular basis.

1:01:52.940 --> 1:01:55.140
 And on a regular basis turns out to be very important.

1:01:55.140 --> 1:01:56.600
 I'll get back to that point in a moment.

1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:58.900
 Whereas the four to six hour eating window

1:01:58.900 --> 1:02:00.380
 doesn't seem to serve people

1:02:00.380 --> 1:02:03.020
 as well as say a seven or eight hour eating window,

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:04.720
 simply because people are overeating

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:05.860
 during that eating window.

1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:07.640
 And the one meal per day,

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:11.600
 while perhaps ideal for certain people's schedules,

1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:13.360
 may actually cause people to under eat.

1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:15.360
 And in some cases that might be what people want.

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:16.980
 They actually want to under eat.

1:02:16.980 --> 1:02:19.820
 But when we start thinking about performance

1:02:19.820 --> 1:02:22.740
 in work and in sport,

1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:25.460
 and when we start considering hormone health

1:02:25.460 --> 1:02:27.860
 and hormone production, fertility,

1:02:27.860 --> 1:02:30.140
 that's when we can really start to look at

1:02:30.140 --> 1:02:33.420
 the seven to nine hour feeding window

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:35.260
 versus the four to six hour feeding window

1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:38.400
 versus the one meal per day type feeding window

1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:40.620
 with some different objectivity.

1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:42.400
 We can start to look at it through a different lens,

1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:46.540
 because it turns out that when you place the feeding window

1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:49.340
 and how long that feeding window is

1:02:49.340 --> 1:02:51.500
 actually will impact a number of other things

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:54.460
 in particular hormones that can be very important

1:02:54.460 --> 1:02:58.040
 for a number of things related to sex and reproduction

1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:01.340
 can be related to performance at work,

1:03:01.340 --> 1:03:03.740
 performance in athleticism.

1:03:03.740 --> 1:03:05.660
 And there are excellent studies on this.

1:03:05.660 --> 1:03:07.920
 So let's explore those now.

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.500
 So let's talk about some conditions

1:03:09.500 --> 1:03:12.180
 where having the feeding window early in the day

1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:14.420
 would actually be very beneficial.

1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:16.420
 There was a study that was published recently

1:03:16.420 --> 1:03:18.740
 in Cell Reports, again, Cell Press Journal,

1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:22.460
 excellent journal, peer reviewed, very stringent

1:03:22.460 --> 1:03:24.380
 from Aoyama et al.

1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:28.040
 So this is A-O-Y-A-M-A et al.

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:31.740
 This was published just recently in July, 2021

1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:36.740
 that looked at the distribution of protein intake

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:40.860
 in different meals delivered either early in the day

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:42.080
 or later in the day.

1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:43.620
 And I'm summarizing here quite a lot,

1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:46.420
 but I should mention that this study was performed

1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:50.200
 in both mice and humans, same paper, mice and humans,

1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:53.040
 and involved hypertrophy training,

1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:57.940
 essentially increasing the weight bearing of given limbs

1:03:57.940 --> 1:03:59.840
 to try and induce hypertrophy,

1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:02.240
 which is the growth of muscle tissue.

1:04:03.580 --> 1:04:08.180
 It does appear that muscle tissue is better able

1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:12.200
 to undergo hypertrophy by virtue of the fact

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:15.740
 that there's better or enhanced protein synthesis

1:04:15.740 --> 1:04:18.020
 early in the day because of the expression

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:21.900
 of one of these particular clock genes called BMAL, B-M-A-L.

1:04:23.300 --> 1:04:26.400
 BMAL regulates a number of different protein synthesis

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:28.840
 pathways within muscle cells,

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:32.300
 such that eating protein early in the day

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:36.200
 supports muscle tissue maintenance and or growth.

1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:38.480
 And in this study, they also looked at the effects

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:41.860
 of supplementing so-called BCAAs, branch chain amino acids,

1:04:41.860 --> 1:04:44.860
 which is popular in bodybuilding circles

1:04:44.860 --> 1:04:46.380
 and in strength training circles.

1:04:46.380 --> 1:04:48.900
 And BCAAs are essential components

1:04:48.900 --> 1:04:51.740
 of a number of different foods,

1:04:51.740 --> 1:04:53.820
 but can also be supplemented.

1:04:53.820 --> 1:04:56.100
 The takeaway of this study is pretty straightforward.

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:58.980
 However, the takeaway is if your main interest

1:04:58.980 --> 1:05:02.120
 is maintaining and or building muscle,

1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:05.620
 then it can be beneficial to ingest protein early in the day.

1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:07.680
 You would still want to obey this,

1:05:08.700 --> 1:05:11.540
 what we're calling a kind of foundational rule

1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:15.700
 of not eating any food for the first hour post-waking,

1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:17.540
 or at least the first hour post-waking.

1:05:17.540 --> 1:05:20.460
 And the cutoff for when you would want to eat protein

1:05:20.460 --> 1:05:23.100
 would be sometime before 10 AM.

1:05:23.100 --> 1:05:24.580
 And there I'm averaging across

1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:27.300
 a number of different situations.

1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.800
 But in general, this BMAL expression is such that,

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:32.460
 let's say you wake up at 7 AM,

1:05:32.460 --> 1:05:35.500
 your main interest is in hypertrophy

1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:36.740
 or maintenance of muscle.

1:05:36.740 --> 1:05:38.580
 Then you would want to ingest some protein

1:05:38.580 --> 1:05:39.980
 sometime before 10 AM.

1:05:39.980 --> 1:05:42.420
 But obviously if you're interested in getting

1:05:42.420 --> 1:05:44.400
 the health effects of intermittent fasting,

1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:46.980
 that you wouldn't ingest any food

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:49.320
 for at least the first 60 minutes upon waking.

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:52.900
 Now it's not as if at 1001 AM,

1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:55.620
 a gate slammed shut and you can't generate hypertrophy.

1:05:55.620 --> 1:05:57.780
 Of course, that's not the case.

1:05:57.780 --> 1:06:00.140
 However, it's very interesting that it doesn't matter

1:06:00.140 --> 1:06:01.640
 when the resistance training,

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:06.020
 the load bearing exercise occurs in the 24 hour cycle.

1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:07.660
 So whether or not, in other words,

1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:09.260
 people are training early in the day

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:11.060
 or they're training late in the day,

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:14.820
 it still appears that ingesting protein early in the day

1:06:14.820 --> 1:06:18.500
 favors hypertrophy or that one is better,

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.980
 or I should say more easily able to access hypertrophy

1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:26.220
 by way of these clock regulated protein synthesis mechanisms

1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:28.980
 by ingesting protein early in the day.

1:06:28.980 --> 1:06:31.420
 In no way, shape or form does this study say

1:06:31.420 --> 1:06:33.200
 that ingesting protein later in the day

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:34.340
 is somehow bad for you.

1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:36.820
 It just emphasizes the positive effects

1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:39.960
 of ingesting protein early in the day

1:06:39.960 --> 1:06:42.940
 for sake of muscle maintenance and or hypertrophy.

1:06:42.940 --> 1:06:44.700
 So if you're somebody who's mainly concerned

1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:46.780
 with muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,

1:06:46.780 --> 1:06:50.540
 then it may make sense to move that feeding window

1:06:50.540 --> 1:06:51.820
 earlier in the day.

1:06:51.820 --> 1:06:53.520
 And certainly there are people out there

1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:56.260
 who are interested in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy

1:06:56.260 --> 1:06:58.020
 who aren't doing intermittent fasting at all.

1:06:58.020 --> 1:06:59.220
 And that's also perfectly fine,

1:06:59.220 --> 1:07:01.020
 but this just so happens to be an episode

1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:04.540
 about intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding.

1:07:04.540 --> 1:07:06.320
 There are of course modes of eating

1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:09.100
 where one eats small meals spread throughout the day

1:07:09.100 --> 1:07:10.860
 or weights meals differently,

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:12.500
 such that meals early in the day

1:07:12.500 --> 1:07:14.920
 are larger than later in the day or vice versa.

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:18.140
 There are a near infinite number of ways to organize this.

1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:21.100
 But if you are somebody who's interested in deriving

1:07:21.100 --> 1:07:23.960
 the many clearly established health effects

1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:25.160
 of time restricted feeding,

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:28.020
 and you are somebody who would like to maintain

1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:29.920
 or build muscle,

1:07:31.060 --> 1:07:35.040
 then ingesting proteins in the early part of the day

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:36.580
 would be important to you,

1:07:36.580 --> 1:07:38.840
 at least on the basis of these results.

1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:41.400
 And therefore that eight hour window

1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:44.240
 that we've established as more or less ideal

1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:46.360
 shifted to the later part of the day

1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:48.660
 might not be as beneficial for you.

1:07:48.660 --> 1:07:51.720
 Now, I can just personally say that for me,

1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:52.760
 when I wake up in the morning,

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:55.920
 it's very easy for me to not eat until noon

1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:57.540
 or one or 2 p.m.

1:07:57.540 --> 1:08:00.920
 Eating early in the day is actually somewhat of a challenge.

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:02.720
 I discussed this point with Sachin

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.220
 because we were talking about

1:08:04.220 --> 1:08:07.220
 how is it that one can move their feeding window

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:09.920
 or place themselves onto a different schedule

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:11.480
 of intermittent fasting.

1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:14.000
 And it's very clear that one needs to provide

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.720
 a transition period in order for that to happen.

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:18.720
 You should allow yourself a transition period

1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:21.820
 of anywhere from one week to 10 days

1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:23.720
 in which you shift your feeding window

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:26.800
 by about an hour each day or so.

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:29.340
 And then once you establish a feeding window

1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:30.880
 that feels comfortable for you

1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:33.180
 and that you think you can maintain over time,

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:35.680
 that you simply maintain that feeding schedule

1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:37.920
 for at least 30 days,

1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:40.280
 but ideally you would do that indefinitely.

1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:41.840
 Now, this turns out to be important

1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:43.600
 based on data that they've gleaned

1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:46.280
 from this my circadian clock,

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:47.760
 massive experiment that they've been doing

1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:48.920
 where people are entering the times

1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:50.820
 that they're feeding and eating.

1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:53.040
 Excuse me, anytime we talk about mice,

1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:54.080
 I always think about feeding

1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:55.800
 because I come from a background

1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:58.440
 and my lab works on both laboratory mice and on humans.

1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:00.240
 Anytime I think about humans, I think about eating,

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:03.640
 but of course they are the same thing.

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:05.000
 The interesting thing to emerge

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.720
 from that very large data set in humans

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.780
 is that when people log their feeding times,

1:09:10.780 --> 1:09:11.700
 as I mentioned before,

1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:15.000
 oftentimes they think they're eating in an eight hour window

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.280
 but they are actually eating in a much broader window.

1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:21.080
 However, even for people that are very good

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:22.920
 about restricting their feeding

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:25.120
 to a four or six or eight hour window,

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:27.360
 if they're very strict about the start and stop times

1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:28.760
 when they ingest calories,

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:32.560
 one of the findings that's really been important to note

1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.960
 is that almost every individual has a lot of drift

1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:41.200
 in when that eating window resides in their 24 hour period.

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:43.260
 In particular on the weekends,

1:09:43.260 --> 1:09:48.160
 people are either extending or shifting their feeding window

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:49.680
 in a way that makes it seem

1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:51.740
 that they've traveled to another time zone

1:09:51.740 --> 1:09:53.920
 and are eating according to another time zone.

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.360
 And this is extremely important.

1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.200
 As I mentioned earlier,

1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:02.880
 based on the 2012 study from Sachin's lab,

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:07.480
 we're eating at a particular phase of each 24 hour cycle

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:10.360
 can help enhance the expression of these clock genes.

1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:15.560
 If you are eating within a very strict

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.180
 or semi-strict feeding window,

1:10:17.180 --> 1:10:19.440
 but that feeding window is migrating around

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:21.260
 from day to day or five days a week,

1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:23.940
 you're really organized about when that falls,

1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:25.440
 let's say for sake of example,

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:27.880
 from noon to 8 PM, noon to 8 PM,

1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:30.680
 Monday, noon to 8 PM, Tuesday, Wednesday,

1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:32.480
 noon to 8 PM, Thursday, and so forth.

1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:36.360
 But then on a Saturday, it's becoming 11 AM

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:38.900
 and you're ending it early,

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:43.320
 or perhaps you're starting early in the day on Sunday,

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:45.680
 you're having brunch that starts at nine 30 or 10,

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:48.240
 and then it's extending out still just eight hours,

1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:49.840
 but it's shifting around.

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.820
 That can cause disruptions

1:10:51.820 --> 1:10:53.880
 in these circadian clock mechanisms

1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:58.680
 that cause disruptions in the downstream effects of eating

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:03.320
 that are taking at least two to three days to recover from.

1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:06.160
 So obviously we don't want to be overly neurotic

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:06.980
 about this stuff,

1:11:06.980 --> 1:11:08.600
 but because this is an episode about the science

1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:11.760
 of intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding,

1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:16.520
 as important as how long your feeding window is,

1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:21.040
 is where that feeding window resides in each 24 hour cycle.

1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:23.220
 And perhaps even more important than that

1:11:23.220 --> 1:11:25.200
 is that it be fairly regular

1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:27.080
 where that feeding window resides,

1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:29.060
 because even if you have a very short feeding window,

1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:31.940
 if it's drifting around from day to day,

1:11:31.940 --> 1:11:33.760
 that actually offsets a number

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:36.880
 of the positive health effects of intermittent fasting.

1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:38.360
 So to really just underscore the way

1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:39.920
 that these different pieces

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:41.980
 of the biological puzzle fit together,

1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:45.280
 if you are very strict or semi-strict

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:46.660
 about your eight hour feeding window,

1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:48.600
 but on the weekends that eight hour feeding window

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:51.320
 is falling later than it normally would

1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.120
 during the middle of the week,

1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:55.800
 it is as if you are going to bed later,

1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:58.040
 even if you're going to bed at the same time,

1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:00.080
 at least from the perspective of metabolic health,

1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:02.920
 because of the way that eating impacts these clock genes

1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:05.520
 and impacts, or I should say,

1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:08.820
 subtracts the sleep related fasting

1:12:08.820 --> 1:12:10.400
 that you would normally experience

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:12.720
 if you were to finish eating

1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.460
 a couple hours before bedtime.

1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:17.620
 So again, we don't want to create any overly obsessive

1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:19.560
 or neurotic focus on this.

1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:21.840
 I think that most all people could benefit

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:24.260
 from a time-restricted feeding schedule,

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:25.360
 but they should really think hard

1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:28.040
 about what they can stick to on a regular basis

1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:30.960
 and understand that they tend to underestimate

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.240
 the feeding window that they actually are partaking in,

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:36.840
 and that they should place that feeding window

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.600
 in a portion of the 24 hour cycle

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:42.920
 that they can be consistent on most days.

1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:44.280
 And I want to emphasize most,

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:46.580
 again, because we are not laboratory mice.

1:12:46.580 --> 1:12:47.720
 We don't have a graduate student

1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:48.960
 coming in for eight hours a day

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:50.320
 because that's what their significant other

1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:51.160
 will allow them to do.

1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:52.900
 And then removing the food from our jowls

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:54.160
 and from our cages,

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:56.860
 we have access to food pretty much 24 hours a day.

1:12:58.240 --> 1:12:59.860
 Along those lines, however,

1:12:59.860 --> 1:13:02.660
 there are things that we can all do

1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:07.320
 that will allow us to offset some of the drift,

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.200
 if you will, that we experience

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.080
 or that we induce in terms of

1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:12.560
 when our feeding window occurs

1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:15.780
 or that the feeding window might push out a little later

1:13:15.780 --> 1:13:18.500
 and then therefore start a little later the next day.

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:19.340
 There are things that we can do

1:13:19.340 --> 1:13:20.540
 and there are things that we can take.

1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:22.580
 And so I'd like to discuss those briefly.

1:13:22.580 --> 1:13:24.340
 So throughout this episode,

1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:27.360
 I've more or less been alluding to the fact

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:29.240
 that when you eat,

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.760
 there's some period of time afterwards

1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:32.760
 in which you're actually still eating,

1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:34.740
 at least from the perspective of metabolism,

1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:37.520
 because glucose is up, insulin is up,

1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:40.040
 and you're undergoing different metabolic

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:43.880
 and digestive processes that don't really speak to you

1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:46.120
 being in a fasted state, right?

1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:48.460
 It's not just about when you take your last bite

1:13:48.460 --> 1:13:49.560
 or your last sip.

1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:52.960
 However, there are things that we can do

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:56.800
 to accelerate the transition from a fed state

1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:00.360
 to a fasted state.

1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.200
 And so I'd like to discuss what those are.

1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:05.560
 And I want to emphasize that the term fed state

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:08.100
 is probably a better way to think about it

1:14:08.100 --> 1:14:09.920
 than eating or not eating,

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:11.700
 because we think of eating as the verb,

1:14:11.700 --> 1:14:13.400
 we're eating, we're eating, okay, we're done eating,

1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:14.440
 I'm fasting now,

1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:18.120
 but you're not actually fasting because you are fed.

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:21.160
 So we should really think about fed and unfed states

1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.460
 because from a cellular processes perspective

1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:24.920
 and from a health perspective,

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:27.400
 that's actually what your body and your system

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:28.760
 are paying attention to.

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:31.320
 And by now with everything that we've laid out,

1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:34.440
 I think that should be intuitive to understand.

1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:36.880
 So there's a fun and exciting concept related to this,

1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:38.460
 which is glucose clearing.

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:40.800
 You may have heard the old adage

1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:44.760
 that if you take a 20 or 30 minute walk after dinner,

1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:47.780
 that it accelerates the rate at which you digest that food.

1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:49.660
 And indeed it does.

1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:52.560
 Clearing out of glucose from your system

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:54.820
 can be accomplished through a number of different means,

1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:57.220
 but light movement or exercise

1:14:57.220 --> 1:14:59.880
 does increase gastric emptying time.

1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:01.400
 So for instance,

1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:05.720
 if you were to eat a meal that ended at 8 PM

1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:09.000
 and then plop to the couch, watch TV,

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.680
 or get on your computer or go to sleep,

1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:16.520
 it would be five or six hours until you have transitioned

1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:19.360
 from a fed state to a fasted state.

1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:22.400
 However, you can accelerate that considerably

1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:25.840
 by taking a 20 or 30 minute, just light walk.

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:27.260
 It doesn't have to be speed walking.

1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:28.440
 It certainly doesn't have to be jogging,

1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:31.880
 but just walking outside or moving around.

1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:36.520
 So glucose clearing is an important aspect of the transition

1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:38.860
 from the fed state to the fasted state.

1:15:38.860 --> 1:15:41.300
 And just a light walk can allow you to do that.

1:15:41.300 --> 1:15:42.640
 Now, if you can't get outside,

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:46.600
 some people will go through the gymnastics literally

1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:48.800
 of doing things like air squats and pushups

1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:49.640
 and things like that.

1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:52.200
 And indeed those will increase the expression of things

1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:56.480
 like Glut4 and things that mobilize glucose into muscles

1:15:56.480 --> 1:15:57.300
 and things of that sort.

1:15:57.300 --> 1:15:59.400
 But, you know, under most conditions,

1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:01.240
 most people aren't doing pushups after dinner,

1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:03.120
 or certainly if you've had a big meal,

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:06.120
 just taking a light walk can be beneficial.

1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:11.120
 In addition, you could consider doing intense exercise.

1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:12.960
 Now you wouldn't necessarily want to do that

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:14.160
 immediately after eating.

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:17.360
 So let's take a look at what high intensity training

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:19.800
 of any kind does to blood glucose,

1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:20.620
 because in this case,

1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:23.360
 it turns out that when you do high intensity training

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:26.560
 actually has opposite effects on blood glucose,

1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:27.720
 depending on whether or not you do it

1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:29.840
 early or later in the day.

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:33.020
 So a fairly recent study looked at so-called HIIT training,

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:34.880
 high intensity interval training,

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:37.000
 which of course can take many different forms.

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.580
 It can take the form of circuit training with weights.

1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:42.060
 It can take the form of, you know, burpees and pushups

1:16:42.060 --> 1:16:44.120
 and sprints and all sorts of different things,

1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:47.000
 but high intensity interval training is typically training

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.480
 that gets people's heart rates up, you know,

1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:54.160
 well above 70% of maximum and then brief periods of rest

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:56.400
 and then repeating and how long the high intensity interval

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:58.400
 training of course will also vary.

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.640
 There are very brief, you know,

1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:02.960
 six or 12 or 15 minute workouts.

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:05.540
 Some people can carry on with high intensity interval

1:17:05.540 --> 1:17:08.420
 training for up to 45 or maybe even 60 minutes

1:17:08.420 --> 1:17:09.360
 in extreme cases.

1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:13.440
 But when you look at the studies that have explored high

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:16.720
 intensity interval training and its effect on blood glucose,

1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.520
 there are a couple of studies that leap out.

1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:19.360
 For instance,

1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:22.120
 one that emphasize that blood glucose levels will actually

1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:24.760
 increase if high intensity interval training is performed

1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:27.800
 early in the day and will decrease if high intensity

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:31.000
 interval training is performed later in the day.

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:36.000
 Now the purpose for this exploration was not to explore

1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:39.080
 clearance of blood glucose for sake of intermittent

1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:39.920
 fasting.

1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:42.360
 It was mainly focused on athletic performance and whether

1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:44.360
 or not that was better early in the day or later in the day,

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:45.560
 et cetera.

1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:50.040
 But we can extract some information from these studies that

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:53.000
 are beneficial for sake of understanding glucose clearing.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.080
 If you have ingested food throughout the afternoon and

1:17:58.080 --> 1:17:59.120
 evening and late in the day,

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:01.800
 and you're thinking about going to sleep and you'd like to

1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:05.840
 enter sleep in a way that is less fed and more fasted,

1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:08.700
 then engaging in high intensity interval training in the

1:18:08.700 --> 1:18:11.240
 afternoon will lower or evening,

1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:14.040
 I should say will lower blood glucose.

1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:16.640
 And in that way will help you accelerate your transition

1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:19.260
 into the fastest state provided you don't ingest something

1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:21.540
 after the high intensity interval training.

1:18:21.540 --> 1:18:25.300
 Now is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from high

1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:27.560
 intensity interval training early in the day,

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:28.680
 is that detrimental?

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:32.560
 Not necessarily so that oftentimes is associated with the

1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:34.840
 shuttling of nutrients to the muscles that have just done a

1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:35.940
 lot of hard work.

1:18:35.940 --> 1:18:39.240
 So it's not that high intensity interval training should not

1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.380
 be done early in the day.

1:18:40.380 --> 1:18:41.320
 In fact, for many people,

1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:44.080
 including myself training early in the day,

1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:46.520
 just for the way that my psychology and biology works is

1:18:46.520 --> 1:18:49.040
 always better for me than training later in the day.

1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:51.700
 And the other important thing to mention is that high

1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:55.060
 intensity interval training done late in the day can be

1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:58.520
 beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing,

1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:01.920
 lowering blood glucose and helping transition from the fed

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:04.920
 to the fasted state in preparation for sleep.

1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:08.840
 However, if you're ingesting caffeine or anything to engage

1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:10.920
 in that high intensity interval training in a way that

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:12.800
 prevents you from getting to sleep, well,

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:14.960
 then it's going to be detrimental overall.

1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:18.000
 So the reason I mentioned this is of course,

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.000
 because it's nice to know that light walks after dinner or

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.640
 any other meal for that matter or high intensity interval

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:25.800
 training provided it's done in the second half of the day,

1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:29.880
 can lower blood glucose and speed the transition from fed to

1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:31.280
 fasted states.

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:34.900
 But I also mention it because what we are really trying to

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:38.200
 achieve when we partake in intermittent fasting,

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.900
 so-called time restricted feeding is what we're really

1:19:40.900 --> 1:19:45.900
 trying to do is access unfed states or fasted states.

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:48.480
 It's not really about when you eat and what you do.

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:52.080
 It's about extending the duration of the fasting period,

1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:53.760
 as long as you can,

1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:56.880
 in a way that's still compatible with your eating, right?

1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:58.760
 Not the other way around.

1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:02.080
 And this gets back to this key feature of our biology,

1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:05.960
 which is that what we eat, when we eat, when we exercise,

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:06.880
 when we view light,

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:10.200
 it's about setting a context or a set of conditions in your

1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:11.460
 brain and body.

1:20:11.460 --> 1:20:14.220
 So it's not so much about the activities that you undergo.

1:20:14.220 --> 1:20:16.840
 It's about the activities you undergo and their

1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:19.520
 relationship to one another over time.

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:21.420
 And so in this way,

1:20:21.420 --> 1:20:24.340
 it really beautifully highlights the way that your biology is

1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:25.560
 interacting all the time.

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.360
 Light is setting when you're going to be awake and when

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:28.600
 you're going to be asleep,

1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:30.480
 when you eat is going to be determining when you're going to

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:33.320
 be awake and when you're going to be asleep and when you eat

1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:37.120
 is also going to be determining when you are able to clear

1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:41.040
 out debris from your brain and body and repair the various

1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:42.720
 cells and mechanisms of your body,

1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:45.720
 when you're able to reduce those inflammatory cytokines

1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:46.940
 throughout your body.

1:20:46.940 --> 1:20:49.680
 And this is really the beauty of time-restricted feeding,

1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:52.560
 which is it's not really about restricting your feeding.

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:56.000
 It's about accessing the beauty of the fasted state.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:00.000
 Now, there are other ways to clear out blood glucose that

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.740
 involve supplements or prescription drugs.

1:21:02.740 --> 1:21:06.400
 These are so-called glucose disposal agents,

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:09.400
 glucose disposal agents, such as metformin,

1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:12.480
 which is a prescription drug or berberine,

1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:15.920
 which is an over the counter substance will lead to very

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:18.440
 dramatic reductions in blood glucose.

1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:21.200
 And so they shift you from a fed to a fasted state.

1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:26.000
 And I know many people who take berberine before eating

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.920
 meals that include a large number of carbohydrates,

1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:32.100
 for instance, as a way to clear out glucose.

1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:33.560
 Now I've tried berberine before.

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:36.540
 And what I can tell you is that if you take berberine,

1:21:36.540 --> 1:21:38.480
 which by the way is very much like metformin,

1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:41.000
 its effects are almost identical to metformin in fact,

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.800
 but it's much less expensive and it's over the counter.

1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:46.200
 If you take berberine and you have not ingested

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:49.500
 carbohydrates, many people, including myself,

1:21:49.500 --> 1:21:52.140
 experience a splitting headache.

1:21:52.140 --> 1:21:55.560
 You become hypoglycemic because it is a glucose clearing

1:21:55.560 --> 1:21:56.400
 agent.

1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:58.880
 So if you're going to experiment with things like metformin

1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:01.080
 and or berberine or similar,

1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:04.280
 you want to be very cautious that you're not clearing out

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:06.600
 blood glucose that's already low.

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:10.280
 And the dose response for this varies tremendously from one

1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:11.600
 individual to the next.

1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:14.020
 And there's a strong circadian component.

1:22:14.020 --> 1:22:17.200
 So some people react very well to berberine early in the

1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:19.040
 day, but find that later in the day,

1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:22.560
 it provides extreme headaches for some people,

1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:23.680
 it's the opposite.

1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:27.200
 So I caution you in exploring things like berberine and

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:30.720
 metformin that you should expect to experience a number of

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:34.240
 physical and psychological effects that may work for you,

1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:37.160
 might be great for you, but might also not be great for you.

1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:38.000
 Nowadays,

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.280
 there are a number of commercially available continuous

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:41.640
 glucose monitors.

1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:42.500
 I've tried one of these.

1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:46.040
 It involves putting what's essentially a patch with a little

1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:47.040
 needle that goes into your skin,

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:49.280
 which is continuing continually, excuse me,

1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:50.720
 monitoring your blood glucose.

1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:52.640
 And you can look at it at an app on your phone.

1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:55.040
 And you can learn a lot that way about how different foods

1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:58.680
 impact the increases and decrease in blood glucose.

1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:01.000
 If you're doing experiments with berberine or metformin,

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.960
 you can see how those impact your blood glucose.

1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:07.240
 You can see how exercise hit training or otherwise impact

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:08.840
 impacts blood glucose.

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:09.700
 Excuse me again.

1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:14.360
 It's very hard to assess blood glucose without a continuous

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:15.400
 blood glucose monitor.

1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:16.800
 And if you're not using one,

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.560
 you're mainly going to be relying on subjective things like,

1:23:19.560 --> 1:23:21.800
 oh, I feel like I have low blood sugar.

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:23.180
 I feel shaky.

1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:24.600
 Like I have high blood sugar or shaky.

1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:25.600
 Cause you have low blood sugar.

1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:30.600
 So I have to say that glucose clearing agents that involve

1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:35.500
 a walk or exercise moderate or intense are going to be a lot

1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:39.320
 easier to titrate and adjust the levels of than things that

1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:41.520
 you're going to take where you have to ingest the dosage.

1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:43.740
 And then once you ingest a certain dosage,

1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:44.800
 you're along for the ride,

1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:47.260
 at least until the effects of that particular compound wear

1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:49.440
 off, it doesn't mean those things don't have utility.

1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:51.420
 It doesn't mean people aren't using them because many

1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:52.260
 people are,

1:23:52.260 --> 1:23:57.120
 but they are potentially a very sharp blade.

1:23:57.120 --> 1:23:58.900
 That is a double sided blade.

1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:01.020
 So I encourage you to approach those with caution.

1:24:01.020 --> 1:24:03.060
 If you decide to at all,

1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:06.520
 it's worth thinking about what the low blood glucose state

1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:10.600
 is and why it's beneficial as well as why it might produce

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:11.440
 headaches.

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.700
 And in some cases can also adjust the effects of other

1:24:13.700 --> 1:24:16.040
 hormones in the fasted state.

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:20.180
 A number of different proteins that are expressed in cells

1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:21.840
 undergo changes in their expression.

1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:23.380
 We talked about this earlier.

1:24:23.380 --> 1:24:24.980
 When we are fasted,

1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:28.540
 we tend to reduce the activity of a particular protein

1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:33.220
 called mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR is very

1:24:33.220 --> 1:24:35.420
 active in cells while they are growing.

1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:37.100
 So throughout development,

1:24:37.100 --> 1:24:40.320
 it's also very active in cancers of various kinds.

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:44.340
 mTOR needs to be what's called phosphorylated.

1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:45.900
 If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.

1:24:45.900 --> 1:24:49.620
 But phosphorylation is a manner in which certain proteins

1:24:49.620 --> 1:24:52.300
 are altered so that they can actually be functional within

1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:53.500
 cells.

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.460
 mTOR is associated with cell growth of all kinds,

1:24:55.460 --> 1:24:56.820
 healthy and unhealthy.

1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:02.460
 When mTOR is phosphorylated, there's a marker called PS6.

1:25:02.460 --> 1:25:05.540
 So phospho mTOR expresses PS6.

1:25:05.540 --> 1:25:08.320
 If this is all escaping you, don't worry about it.

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:12.460
 Phospho mTOR and PS6 are reduced by fasting.

1:25:12.460 --> 1:25:14.180
 Now this makes sense if you think about it,

1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:17.300
 because eating and growth are associated with each other.

1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:21.980
 Fasting is not necessarily anti-growth,

1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:23.500
 but it is not pro-growth.

1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:26.900
 And when we fast, we see increases in cells of things like

1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:31.160
 AMPK, the sirtuins, things like transcription factors,

1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:34.720
 like FOXO, ATF and ketones or ketone bodies.

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:36.620
 You may have heard of the ketogenic diet.

1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:38.160
 What's the point of all this biochemistry.

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:41.440
 It's not to just blitz you with a bunch of cellular biology

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:42.660
 and biochemistry.

1:25:42.660 --> 1:25:45.140
 It's to say that we have cell growth pathways involving

1:25:45.140 --> 1:25:50.140
 mTOR and PS6, and we have cell repair

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.980
 and cell shrinkage processes that are associated with AMPK,

1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:56.060
 the so-called sirtuins,

1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:59.180
 which Dr. David Sinclair from Harvard and others are famous

1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:04.100
 for discovering and understanding things like AMPK.

1:26:04.100 --> 1:26:07.060
 These two different divergent pathways of cell growth

1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:10.180
 and cell breakdown and repair.

1:26:10.180 --> 1:26:12.260
 And by breakdown, I mean actual clearance,

1:26:12.260 --> 1:26:14.980
 autophagy and repair.

1:26:14.980 --> 1:26:17.700
 Those can be triggered by being in either the fed

1:26:17.700 --> 1:26:18.980
 or the fasted state.

1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:21.680
 So one way I'd like you to think about the fed state,

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:24.540
 not just eating, but having recently eaten

1:26:24.540 --> 1:26:27.940
 or the fasted state, meaning high blood glucose

1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:31.980
 and or you've recently eaten or are currently eating

1:26:31.980 --> 1:26:34.780
 or drinking calories is that when you eat

1:26:34.780 --> 1:26:36.300
 or when you don't eat, when you're fed,

1:26:36.300 --> 1:26:37.140
 when you're fasted,

1:26:37.140 --> 1:26:40.180
 you are either promoting cellular growth of all kinds

1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:42.640
 or you're promoting cellular repair

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:44.460
 and clearance of all kinds.

1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:46.860
 And so, again, this is about setting conditions

1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:48.300
 in the brain and body.

1:26:48.300 --> 1:26:52.440
 It's not so much about when you eat food A or B,

1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:55.000
 it leads to increases in mTOR.

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.860
 Anytime you eat any food,

1:26:56.860 --> 1:26:59.940
 doesn't matter if it's plant-based, animal-based, fat,

1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:01.840
 protein, carbohydrate, doesn't matter.

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:04.960
 You are biasing your system towards a biochemical state

1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:05.840
 of cell growth.

1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:08.300
 And anytime you haven't eaten for a while

1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:10.080
 or blood glucose is low,

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:13.900
 you're biasing your system toward a state of cellular repair.

1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:17.480
 And this is why people who do not suffer

1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:20.300
 from any blood glucose regulation issues,

1:27:20.300 --> 1:27:23.080
 take things like berberine as glucose disposal agents

1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:23.920
 or take metformin.

1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:26.380
 I'm not necessarily suggesting that you do that,

1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:29.180
 but it's because those things mimic fasting.

1:27:29.180 --> 1:27:32.060
 They create situations in the body that promote things

1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:35.540
 like AMPK and the sirtuins and others to push your body

1:27:35.540 --> 1:27:37.820
 and your system down a route of repair,

1:27:37.820 --> 1:27:40.660
 even though you might've just eaten a meal an hour ago.

1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:42.540
 Along the lines of the health benefits

1:27:42.540 --> 1:27:44.300
 of intermittent fasting,

1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:46.820
 there are nice data showing improvements

1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:49.300
 in the gut microbiome.

1:27:49.300 --> 1:27:51.000
 And in particular,

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.420
 in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome

1:27:53.420 --> 1:27:57.640
 and other forms of colitis in time-restricted feeding,

1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:00.020
 meaning time-restricted feeding seems to be able

1:28:00.020 --> 1:28:02.980
 to assist people with those conditions

1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:05.420
 following the general parameters that I discussed before,

1:28:05.420 --> 1:28:06.700
 eight hours and so forth.

1:28:07.660 --> 1:28:08.700
 Why and how?

1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:11.700
 Well, by way of intermittent fasting,

1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:14.100
 impacting the expression of these various clock genes

1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:17.280
 and because the clock genes impact the mucosal lining,

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:19.540
 the mucus lining of the gut,

1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:22.860
 it appears that intermittent fasting

1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:26.340
 can reduce the amount of so-called lactobacillus

1:28:26.340 --> 1:28:28.000
 that's present in the gut.

1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.840
 And lactobacillus is when in high levels is correlated

1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:34.300
 with a number of different metabolic disorders.

1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:35.160
 At the same time,

1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:38.540
 time-restricted feeding seems to enhance the proliferation

1:28:38.540 --> 1:28:42.740
 of some of the gut microbiota like oscillobacter

1:28:42.740 --> 1:28:43.900
 and some of the other ones

1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:46.540
 that promote healthy mucosal lining

1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:50.480
 and that promote better overall intestinal function.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.380
 So these are pathways that have now been established

1:28:53.380 --> 1:28:55.060
 and it appears that intermittent fasting

1:28:55.060 --> 1:28:57.360
 isn't just modulating these processes,

1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:58.940
 but is actually having a direct effect

1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:00.180
 on the mucosal lining in a way

1:29:00.180 --> 1:29:02.740
 that favors a healthier gut microbiome.

1:29:02.740 --> 1:29:04.420
 So it should come as no surprise

1:29:04.420 --> 1:29:07.040
 that many people who experience gut issues benefit

1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:08.720
 from restricting their feeding window

1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:11.700
 to eight hours or so per every 24 hour period.

1:29:11.700 --> 1:29:14.420
 The other very exciting finding about intermittent fasting

1:29:14.420 --> 1:29:17.260
 is one of the major health issues these days

1:29:17.260 --> 1:29:20.480
 is the proliferation of so-called

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.420
 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

1:29:23.420 --> 1:29:26.300
 30 years or so non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

1:29:26.300 --> 1:29:28.260
 was exceedingly rare to see in the clinic,

1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:30.580
 except in alcoholics.

1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:32.600
 Fatty deposits in the liver are bad.

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:34.900
 It is essentially liver disease.

1:29:34.900 --> 1:29:38.140
 Nowadays, children and adults are showing up

1:29:38.140 --> 1:29:40.180
 with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

1:29:40.180 --> 1:29:42.940
 Some of these people are obese, others are not,

1:29:42.940 --> 1:29:44.700
 but it's a serious health concern

1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:48.040
 and it's growing in numbers all the time.

1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:51.700
 A recent study that was published in Cell Reports Medicine

1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:54.860
 just a couple of weeks ago tested the hypothesis

1:29:54.860 --> 1:29:57.340
 whether or not the gut microbiome

1:29:57.340 --> 1:30:01.780
 or so-called brown fat tissue is impacting the liver health

1:30:01.780 --> 1:30:06.020
 and in particular non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

1:30:06.020 --> 1:30:07.940
 The short takeaway from this study is that

1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:10.260
 contrary to what was previously thought,

1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:12.660
 the gut microbiome, while very important

1:30:12.660 --> 1:30:15.420
 for a number of other processes in the body,

1:30:15.420 --> 1:30:16.920
 doesn't seem to be related

1:30:16.920 --> 1:30:18.900
 to this non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

1:30:18.900 --> 1:30:20.960
 This is surprising to people or should be

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:22.360
 to those of you that have been following

1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:23.660
 the gut microbiome literature.

1:30:23.660 --> 1:30:27.860
 However, brown fat, which is a healthy fat

1:30:27.860 --> 1:30:30.740
 that we have between our two scapulae and in our upper neck,

1:30:30.740 --> 1:30:32.860
 it doesn't tend to be blubbery type fat pads,

1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:34.580
 but it sits deep to the skin,

1:30:34.580 --> 1:30:36.740
 but creates a thermogenic effect in the body

1:30:37.900 --> 1:30:41.480
 that is helpful for reducing the amount of other fat,

1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:43.900
 the type of fat that we're more typically used to thinking

1:30:43.900 --> 1:30:45.700
 about and talking about white fat and pink fat

1:30:45.700 --> 1:30:48.560
 that's subcutaneous fat around the abdomen and so forth.

1:30:49.860 --> 1:30:52.980
 Brown fat seems to have a direct correlation

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:55.580
 with the lack of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

1:30:55.580 --> 1:30:57.740
 What this study showed was that

1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:02.060
 in people that have diminished concentrations of brown fat,

1:31:02.940 --> 1:31:05.760
 there is a higher probability

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:07.820
 of having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

1:31:07.820 --> 1:31:10.680
 Now, the good news is brown fat stores can be increased.

1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:13.260
 And again, this isn't going to create blubber of brown fat.

1:31:13.260 --> 1:31:15.060
 This is going to create increased thermogenesis

1:31:15.060 --> 1:31:17.220
 and actually make people leaner.

1:31:17.220 --> 1:31:18.180
 And brown fat has a number

1:31:18.180 --> 1:31:20.500
 of other important positive effects.

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:23.440
 Now, this is interesting because cold exposure

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:25.660
 of anywhere from one to three minutes,

1:31:25.660 --> 1:31:27.660
 two or four times per week, or maybe even 10 minutes,

1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:31.140
 two to four times per week can increase brown fat stores.

1:31:31.140 --> 1:31:34.540
 Also time-restricted feeding has now been tied

1:31:34.540 --> 1:31:37.600
 to the density of brown fat stores.

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:39.480
 So time-restricted feeding also seems

1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:42.100
 to positively increase brown fat stores,

1:31:42.100 --> 1:31:44.300
 probably because of the way that brown fat stores relate

1:31:44.300 --> 1:31:45.820
 to epinephrine and adrenaline,

1:31:45.820 --> 1:31:48.220
 which tend to go up when we're fasted.

1:31:48.220 --> 1:31:49.140
 What does this all mean?

1:31:49.140 --> 1:31:51.640
 This means for sake of liver health

1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:54.500
 and for sake of reducing or maybe preventing

1:31:54.500 --> 1:31:56.280
 or even potentially,

1:31:56.280 --> 1:31:57.740
 want to underline potentially reversing

1:31:57.740 --> 1:31:59.940
 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,

1:31:59.940 --> 1:32:03.380
 time-restricted feeding also appears to be beneficial.

1:32:03.380 --> 1:32:05.040
 Many people out there are interested

1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:07.540
 in optimizing their hormones.

1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:09.820
 And as we mentioned earlier, insulin is a hormone

1:32:09.820 --> 1:32:11.620
 and time-restricted feeding seems

1:32:11.620 --> 1:32:12.900
 to have very positive effects

1:32:12.900 --> 1:32:15.980
 on overall insulin profiles and so forth.

1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:18.620
 But anytime you mention hormones,

1:32:18.620 --> 1:32:21.400
 people immediately seem to leap to the sex steroid hormones,

1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:23.220
 testosterone and estrogen,

1:32:23.220 --> 1:32:24.900
 because indeed they have powerful effects,

1:32:24.900 --> 1:32:28.040
 both in the short-term and the long-term in terms

1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:31.120
 of our mental and physical health and performance.

1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:33.660
 There's at least one study that's explored the effects

1:32:33.660 --> 1:32:36.780
 of time-restricted eating on performance,

1:32:36.780 --> 1:32:38.780
 athletic performance, immune function,

1:32:38.780 --> 1:32:40.620
 and body composition.

1:32:40.620 --> 1:32:43.060
 This was a study by Morrow et al

1:32:43.060 --> 1:32:45.060
 that was performed on elite cyclists.

1:32:45.060 --> 1:32:46.660
 So I want to point that out.

1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:49.420
 It was a randomized control trial,

1:32:49.420 --> 1:32:51.740
 but what's really nice about this study is

1:32:51.740 --> 1:32:56.740
 that it explored a number of different hormonal parameters

1:32:57.620 --> 1:32:59.640
 in people that were using time-restricted eating

1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:02.180
 or that had a more extended eating window.

1:33:02.180 --> 1:33:04.540
 And they tracked everything very carefully.

1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:06.980
 And the amount of food they were eating

1:33:06.980 --> 1:33:10.260
 was actually pretty considerable, 4,800 calories.

1:33:10.260 --> 1:33:11.820
 So that's a lot of calories,

1:33:11.820 --> 1:33:13.960
 but then again, they were very active.

1:33:13.960 --> 1:33:15.900
 And they've measured a number

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:18.940
 of different things related to VO2 max, et cetera.

1:33:18.940 --> 1:33:23.580
 Performance and overall performance at what they did,

1:33:23.580 --> 1:33:26.860
 cycling is not the point that I want to emphasize here.

1:33:26.860 --> 1:33:28.900
 Although there were some positive effects

1:33:28.900 --> 1:33:32.020
 on their performance related to time-restricted eating.

1:33:32.020 --> 1:33:35.960
 The point I want to talk about relates to things

1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:38.320
 that presumably relate to most everybody,

1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:41.980
 which are the effects on things like glucose,

1:33:41.980 --> 1:33:44.380
 thyroid hormone, testosterone,

1:33:44.380 --> 1:33:45.860
 sex hormone binding globulin,

1:33:45.860 --> 1:33:48.960
 which can bind up testosterone and prevent

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:50.960
 the so-called free form of testosterone,

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:53.340
 which is the one that has most of the actions

1:33:53.340 --> 1:33:55.120
 in the brain and body.

1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:57.460
 And the major takeaway from this study

1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:59.900
 was that time-restricted feeding

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:02.260
 of the same amount of calories

1:34:02.260 --> 1:34:04.700
 as the so-called control condition, okay?

1:34:04.700 --> 1:34:06.740
 Same calories, but either compact

1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:10.020
 throughout the 24 hour cycle to an eight hour feeding window

1:34:10.020 --> 1:34:13.780
 or allowing them to eat over a larger feeding window

1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:18.060
 did lead to significant decreases in free testosterone.

1:34:18.060 --> 1:34:20.540
 And I think a number of people will raise their eyebrows

1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:21.740
 to that and think, oh,

1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:24.100
 well then maybe time-restricted feeding is not for me.

1:34:24.100 --> 1:34:26.140
 There are a number of important considerations, of course.

1:34:26.140 --> 1:34:30.340
 One is while the decrease in free testosterone

1:34:30.340 --> 1:34:31.660
 was significant,

1:34:31.660 --> 1:34:33.960
 it's also going to depend on where people start out.

1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:36.980
 So if somebody has already low or modest levels

1:34:36.980 --> 1:34:39.900
 of testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,

1:34:39.900 --> 1:34:43.080
 that could lead them into a state of poor performance

1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:43.920
 and wellbeing.

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:45.980
 Whereas if somebody has higher testosterone,

1:34:45.980 --> 1:34:47.880
 a decrease won't necessarily do that.

1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:50.080
 So it's important to take that into consideration.

1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:51.300
 This is why I'm always such a fan

1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:53.480
 of people doing their blood work

1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:56.520
 and knowing what's going on under the hood for them.

1:34:56.520 --> 1:34:59.500
 A very interesting change in hormonal profile

1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:02.220
 was cortisol, so-called stress hormone.

1:35:02.220 --> 1:35:03.060
 Cortisol, of course,

1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:05.180
 is also naturally released early in the day

1:35:05.180 --> 1:35:08.300
 in a healthy way to wake you up and promote alertness,

1:35:08.300 --> 1:35:10.820
 but you don't want its levels to be too high

1:35:10.820 --> 1:35:13.620
 or to have peaks in cortisol late in the day.

1:35:13.620 --> 1:35:15.040
 It's actually correlated with depression

1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:17.780
 and a number of other untoward things.

1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:22.140
 I would have thought that by restricting a feeding window

1:35:22.140 --> 1:35:24.420
 to a particular time each day,

1:35:24.420 --> 1:35:26.180
 that these hard training cyclists

1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:29.380
 would have undergone increases in serum cortisol.

1:35:29.380 --> 1:35:32.020
 And in fact, the opposite was true.

1:35:32.020 --> 1:35:35.680
 They had significant reductions in serum cortisol

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:37.680
 as a consequence of time-restricted feeding.

1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:39.580
 I should mention there were significant reductions

1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:42.680
 in serum cortisol also in the control group,

1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:44.660
 but not to the same extent.

1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:46.660
 And the two groups did differ significantly

1:35:46.660 --> 1:35:48.060
 from one another.

1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:50.680
 Now, this is important because if you just look

1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:52.800
 at one hormone, testosterone, you'd say,

1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:55.860
 okay, based on these data, time-restricted feeding

1:35:55.860 --> 1:35:58.520
 is reducing testosterone levels significantly,

1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:00.540
 even though the number of calories is quite high

1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:02.540
 and is held constant across the study.

1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:05.660
 But in fact, because cortisol is lower,

1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:08.140
 it may mean that the effects of testosterone

1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:10.260
 or the reduction in testosterone is offset.

1:36:10.260 --> 1:36:12.500
 And that's because cortisol and testosterone

1:36:12.500 --> 1:36:14.900
 are always in this somewhat of a dance

1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:17.300
 in terms of cortisol inhibiting the effects

1:36:17.300 --> 1:36:20.160
 of testosterone largely and vice versa.

1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:22.100
 So it is interesting and important

1:36:22.100 --> 1:36:24.380
 to look at the total gallery of hormones.

1:36:24.380 --> 1:36:26.700
 And they did look at a number of hormones.

1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:28.500
 They looked at other inflammatory markers.

1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:29.720
 Those were not increased.

1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:30.740
 That's not surprising.

1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:33.740
 If you remember back to the 2012 Sachin Panda study,

1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:36.980
 this early pioneering study on time-restricted feeding,

1:36:36.980 --> 1:36:39.580
 they saw reductions in stress hormones

1:36:39.580 --> 1:36:41.100
 and in inflammatory markers

1:36:41.100 --> 1:36:43.380
 in time-restricted feeding mice.

1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:46.200
 And here, this also seems to be the case in humans.

1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:50.420
 So the takeaway is for sake of hormone health,

1:36:50.420 --> 1:36:53.900
 time-restricted feeding is compatible

1:36:53.900 --> 1:36:55.520
 with quality hormone health,

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:57.940
 even in high-performing athletes.

1:36:57.940 --> 1:36:59.900
 Based on everything we know and that we've discussed,

1:36:59.900 --> 1:37:01.780
 I would not suggest that people restrict

1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:03.740
 their feeding window to less than eight hours,

1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:06.500
 especially if they're training hard on a regular basis.

1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:10.820
 And it's not just athletes that should pay attention to this

1:37:10.820 --> 1:37:12.260
 when we are working very hard,

1:37:12.260 --> 1:37:14.300
 when we are psychologically stressed,

1:37:14.300 --> 1:37:16.960
 when we are studying for exams,

1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:20.980
 or we are in conflict with somebody on a regular basis,

1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:22.880
 that creates a stress in the body

1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:25.420
 that's very similar to that of physical training.

1:37:25.420 --> 1:37:26.840
 The body and brain don't distinguish

1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:28.580
 between physical stress and mental stress.

1:37:28.580 --> 1:37:29.700
 It's all nervous system.

1:37:29.700 --> 1:37:32.020
 Remember that it's just cortisol and adrenaline.

1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:35.400
 There's no special hormone just for physical stress

1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:37.220
 versus psychological stress.

1:37:37.220 --> 1:37:39.940
 So again, in thinking about what sort of feeding window

1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:40.780
 will be right for you,

1:37:40.780 --> 1:37:43.960
 we arrive back at this eight-hour time bin

1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:47.660
 that seems more or less flexible for most conditions,

1:37:47.660 --> 1:37:49.700
 even high-performing elite athletes.

1:37:49.700 --> 1:37:52.740
 And I would say just by logical extension,

1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:55.060
 even for people that have a lot of stress in their life.

1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:57.580
 And I personally wouldn't suggest

1:37:57.580 --> 1:37:59.320
 that people who have a lot of stress in their life

1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:01.260
 or the potential for stress in their life

1:38:01.260 --> 1:38:05.540
 shorten their feeding window much shorter than eight hours,

1:38:05.540 --> 1:38:07.500
 because then you would expect

1:38:07.500 --> 1:38:08.880
 that you would start to increase

1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:10.380
 some of the inflammatory markers.

1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:12.180
 You would increase the stress hormones

1:38:12.180 --> 1:38:15.820
 and you would be decreasing things like testosterone

1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:17.700
 and estrogen and some of the sex steroid hormones.

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:20.500
 So again, it's all about context and the eight-hour window.

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:23.200
 It isn't holy, but seems to be a really useful guide

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:26.700
 to extract the great health benefits

1:38:26.700 --> 1:38:29.680
 of which there are many and of which we've discussed

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:33.760
 from intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,

1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:35.900
 and yet that it could still be compatible

1:38:35.900 --> 1:38:37.620
 with decent social schedules

1:38:37.620 --> 1:38:40.080
 and for maintaining hormone health.

1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:41.380
 In keeping with this,

1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:44.060
 for women that are trying to maintain ovulatory cycles

1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:46.760
 or for couples that are trying to get pregnant,

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.340
 I think it's also important

1:38:48.340 --> 1:38:52.500
 to not create a feeding window that's too short.

1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:56.760
 The relationship between feeding and body fat stores

1:38:56.760 --> 1:38:59.580
 and glucose and leptin and hormones

1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:00.680
 is a well-established one.

1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.300
 And we can summarize it very easily here,

1:39:02.300 --> 1:39:03.580
 although I've done several episodes

1:39:03.580 --> 1:39:06.560
 related to this previously on optimizing hormone health.

1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:09.400
 But basically, we undergo puberty

1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:13.540
 when there's enough food and there's enough body fat

1:39:13.540 --> 1:39:16.300
 that the body fat sends a signal to the brain called leptin,

1:39:16.300 --> 1:39:17.860
 that's a hormone that comes from body fat,

1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:20.940
 signals to the brain to turn on puberty.

1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:23.500
 That's puberty, but even as adults,

1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:25.140
 for women that are menstruating,

1:39:25.140 --> 1:39:27.940
 there needs to be sufficient leptin signaling to the brain

1:39:27.940 --> 1:39:29.340
 in order to maintain ovulation

1:39:29.340 --> 1:39:31.020
 because of the way that the brain communicates

1:39:31.020 --> 1:39:32.800
 with the pituitary and the ovaries.

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.880
 Similarly, for men,

1:39:36.180 --> 1:39:40.020
 fasting or extreme exercise plus fasting,

1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:42.260
 we now know reduces testosterone.

1:39:43.300 --> 1:39:45.700
 Its impacts are not exactly clear.

1:39:45.700 --> 1:39:48.480
 However, if you reduce food intake,

1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:52.080
 either in total calories or in duration too much,

1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:55.720
 you will suffer a drop in sperm counts, fertility will drop.

1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:56.560
 And this makes sense.

1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:58.140
 The body is communicating to the brain

1:39:58.140 --> 1:40:01.380
 whether or not conditions are sufficient in the body

1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:05.820
 to reproduce and to presumably and hopefully support

1:40:05.820 --> 1:40:08.040
 the health and wellbeing of those offspring.

1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:10.940
 So there's a logical link between body fat and eating

1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:13.380
 and how much food is available to you

1:40:13.380 --> 1:40:15.180
 and how long it's available to you

1:40:15.180 --> 1:40:16.220
 and the signals in the brain

1:40:16.220 --> 1:40:18.460
 that allow for reproductive success.

1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:20.980
 There are some data that pointed differences

1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:22.820
 in the effects of intermittent fasting

1:40:22.820 --> 1:40:25.460
 for males versus females.

1:40:25.460 --> 1:40:28.020
 Those data right now only come from mice.

1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:30.420
 That study was published by Sachin Panda recently.

1:40:30.420 --> 1:40:33.580
 We still await the studies in humans.

1:40:33.580 --> 1:40:36.380
 Some people do not do well on intermittent fasting,

1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:38.820
 either in terms of mood or hormone health.

1:40:38.820 --> 1:40:40.720
 And so everyone needs to determine for themselves

1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:43.540
 whether or not having a time-restricted feeding window

1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:44.640
 is good for them,

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:47.080
 how long that time-restricted feeding window should be.

1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:50.280
 I think eight hours is kind of a nice minimum to adhere to

1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:52.220
 based on everything that we've covered today.

1:40:52.220 --> 1:40:54.800
 And for some people,

1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:57.020
 time-restricted feeding is not going to be compatible

1:40:57.020 --> 1:40:58.140
 with hormone health for them.

1:40:58.140 --> 1:41:01.720
 For them, eating more meals spread throughout the day,

1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:04.540
 presumably smaller meals, same caloric intake,

1:41:04.540 --> 1:41:06.740
 is going to be more beneficial for their hormones.

1:41:06.740 --> 1:41:08.620
 This is something that is going to be individual

1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:10.760
 and is going to have to be determined

1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:11.940
 on an individual basis.

1:41:11.940 --> 1:41:15.220
 However, if you're going to try time-restricted feeding,

1:41:15.220 --> 1:41:17.980
 I do want to remind you that taking a period of three to seven

1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:20.060
 or ideally 10 days to transition into it,

1:41:20.060 --> 1:41:23.300
 not just going flipping from eating to three meals a day

1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:25.160
 that span from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:27.140
 and suddenly going to an eight-hour feeding window,

1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:30.440
 but rather winnowing down that feeding window

1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:32.380
 about an hour or so per day

1:41:32.380 --> 1:41:34.640
 is going to allow the hormone systems of your body,

1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:37.420
 including leptin, the hypocretin-erexin system,

1:41:37.420 --> 1:41:39.540
 which are systems within the body that signal to the brain

1:41:39.540 --> 1:41:41.380
 that food is about to come,

1:41:41.380 --> 1:41:43.220
 allowing those systems to adjust

1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:46.180
 so that you're not overwhelmingly hungry, irritable,

1:41:46.180 --> 1:41:48.420
 and you're not throwing your whole hormone system

1:41:48.420 --> 1:41:49.720
 out of whack.

1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:52.020
 I keep coming back to this eight-hour feeding window

1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:54.200
 and I want to provide a little more basis for it

1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:57.400
 and just to encourage that it's not completely arbitrary.

1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:01.120
 The lengthy review that I mentioned earlier

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:02.380
 features a number of studies

1:42:02.380 --> 1:42:05.220
 that have used this eight-hour feeding window.

1:42:05.220 --> 1:42:08.240
 But there's a particular study that I'd like to highlight,

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:09.820
 mainly because I don't expect people to delve

1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:12.900
 into the full reference list of the other review.

1:42:12.900 --> 1:42:15.020
 And this is a study that was carried out

1:42:15.020 --> 1:42:18.300
 between Sachin Panda's lab and Christopher Verity's lab.

1:42:18.300 --> 1:42:19.740
 So this is a collaboration.

1:42:19.740 --> 1:42:21.420
 The study was carried out in humans

1:42:21.420 --> 1:42:24.580
 and is entitled effects of eight-hour time-restricted feeding

1:42:24.580 --> 1:42:27.400
 on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors

1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:30.260
 in obese adults, excuse me.

1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:32.660
 And this study essentially showed,

1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:34.780
 I'll just read the conclusions,

1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:37.740
 that an eight-hour time-restricted feeding

1:42:37.740 --> 1:42:41.140
 produces a mild caloric restriction and weight loss

1:42:42.100 --> 1:42:43.700
 without calorie counting.

1:42:43.700 --> 1:42:45.020
 So that's key, right?

1:42:45.020 --> 1:42:46.340
 These people aren't calorie counting.

1:42:46.340 --> 1:42:49.360
 Somehow just by adhering to an eight-hour window,

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:54.360
 they are taking in fewer calories than they're burning off

1:42:54.700 --> 1:42:57.860
 and clinically it reduced blood pressure.

1:42:57.860 --> 1:42:58.840
 So I mentioned the study,

1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.340
 not because there aren't many others

1:43:00.340 --> 1:43:03.220
 involving the eight-hour feeding window, also in humans,

1:43:03.220 --> 1:43:06.020
 but because the eight-hour feeding window has been tested

1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:07.820
 in obese adults and non-obese adults.

1:43:07.820 --> 1:43:10.420
 And there are even a few studies in children.

1:43:10.420 --> 1:43:12.220
 So this eight-hour window seems to be

1:43:12.220 --> 1:43:15.140
 a really good rule of thumb and a kind of anchor

1:43:15.140 --> 1:43:17.980
 around which we can each think about

1:43:17.980 --> 1:43:19.900
 incorporating time-restricted feeding.

1:43:19.900 --> 1:43:22.180
 There are, of course, other patterns of feeding.

1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:26.520
 And while some people have engaged in longer fasts

1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:31.060
 of 24 hours, 36 hours, or more,

1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:35.200
 alternate day fasting, meaning eating one day,

1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:37.820
 not eating the next day, or in some cases eating one day

1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:39.340
 and eating very few calories,

1:43:39.340 --> 1:43:43.420
 500 or 600 calories the next day, has been tested.

1:43:43.420 --> 1:43:46.140
 A few studies have also looked at eating

1:43:46.140 --> 1:43:48.380
 a sort of maintenance level of calories for five days

1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:52.080
 and then taking two days and fasting clear through

1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:55.860
 or eating very few calories, 300 or 500 calories.

1:43:55.860 --> 1:43:59.380
 In fact, there's a sort of a community online

1:43:59.380 --> 1:44:01.260
 of people that are exploring longer fasts

1:44:01.260 --> 1:44:03.220
 for sake of trying to offset dementia

1:44:03.220 --> 1:44:05.500
 or reverse effects of dementia.

1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:08.580
 Thus far, at least in my awareness,

1:44:08.580 --> 1:44:12.220
 there isn't any quality clinical peer-reviewed study

1:44:12.220 --> 1:44:14.820
 on that yet for sake of dementia.

1:44:14.820 --> 1:44:16.020
 Although I await those studies

1:44:16.020 --> 1:44:17.540
 and if anyone's aware of them,

1:44:17.540 --> 1:44:19.740
 please send me a link in the comments.

1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:22.740
 But alternate day fasting has gotten

1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:24.540
 the so-called safe bill of health.

1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:25.680
 This has been written up,

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:27.460
 meaning that people didn't suffer bone loss.

1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:31.260
 They didn't suffer any major detrimental effects.

1:44:31.260 --> 1:44:35.940
 It does seem that it can create significant weight loss

1:44:35.940 --> 1:44:38.600
 and can help with obese individuals,

1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:40.820
 that it can reduce resting blood glucose.

1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:43.300
 And every other day fasting, in many cases,

1:44:43.300 --> 1:44:46.200
 can produce more rapid effects on weight loss

1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:49.380
 and reductions in blood glucose than time-restricted feeding.

1:44:49.380 --> 1:44:52.960
 However, every other day type fasting,

1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:56.120
 for most people, is not going to be feasible.

1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:57.540
 They're just not going to be able to do that

1:44:57.540 --> 1:44:58.480
 for a long period of time.

1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:00.720
 And what hasn't really been done is the follow-up,

1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:03.340
 to see whether or not people who do every other day fasting

1:45:03.340 --> 1:45:06.120
 or five days of eating followed by two days of fasting,

1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:08.740
 whether or not that leads to a rebound in weight gain,

1:45:08.740 --> 1:45:10.140
 whether or not that leads to a rebound

1:45:10.140 --> 1:45:11.740
 in blood glucose, et cetera.

1:45:11.740 --> 1:45:13.980
 So for now, the eight-hour feeding window

1:45:13.980 --> 1:45:18.980
 and time-restricted feeding seems to be the most tested,

1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:22.420
 supported in animal studies and in human studies,

1:45:22.420 --> 1:45:25.660
 and the one around which I think most people should orient

1:45:25.660 --> 1:45:28.240
 if they're considering getting into time-restricted feeding.

1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:31.860
 It's also sort of hard to imagine how one could include

1:45:31.860 --> 1:45:35.760
 a significant exercise schedule or work schedule

1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:37.100
 on every other day fasting.

1:45:37.100 --> 1:45:40.300
 Remember, in any study, people are often being compensated,

1:45:40.300 --> 1:45:42.980
 or at least are incentivized in some way

1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:44.860
 to adhere to the study.

1:45:44.860 --> 1:45:47.300
 This is one of the major issues that I have with any study

1:45:47.300 --> 1:45:49.540
 that says that three or four different diets

1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:52.600
 are essentially equal in terms of their ability

1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:54.080
 to produce weight loss.

1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:57.200
 Adherence is very different in the outside world,

1:45:57.200 --> 1:45:59.300
 where you don't have a researcher monitoring you,

1:45:59.300 --> 1:46:01.120
 where you're not logging all your food.

1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:03.260
 Most people don't do that consistently.

1:46:03.260 --> 1:46:05.400
 And we can take a little bit of a neuroscience perspective

1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:07.580
 on this to try and arrive at what the best kind

1:46:07.580 --> 1:46:10.980
 of organization of an eating plan, or if we wanted

1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:13.320
 to call it a diet, we could, would be for you.

1:46:14.680 --> 1:46:17.380
 Many people find it easier to just not eat

1:46:17.380 --> 1:46:20.060
 for certain periods of each 24-hour cycle

1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:21.620
 than to eat smaller portions.

1:46:21.620 --> 1:46:24.500
 Portion control is very hard for some people.

1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:26.980
 For other people, it's manageable.

1:46:26.980 --> 1:46:30.620
 But people like me, I don't eat half the croissant.

1:46:30.620 --> 1:46:32.260
 I don't think it's a real thing.

1:46:32.260 --> 1:46:35.300
 It's not available to me, I should say.

1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:38.100
 Now, of course I could eat just half a croissant.

1:46:38.100 --> 1:46:39.740
 But I noticed that when I eat the croissant,

1:46:39.740 --> 1:46:41.300
 because they're so delicious,

1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:43.660
 that it creates a rise in blood glucose,

1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:46.480
 a rise in the other hormones and chemicals

1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:48.420
 that are associated with ingesting delicious,

1:46:48.420 --> 1:46:50.120
 highly palatable food.

1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:52.220
 And it's actually a lot of work for me

1:46:52.220 --> 1:46:54.500
 to just eat half the croissant.

1:46:54.500 --> 1:46:58.860
 There's something that's much more thoroughly satisfying

1:46:58.860 --> 1:47:00.660
 about eating the entire croissant.

1:47:00.660 --> 1:47:03.360
 And actually, there's something that's somewhat satisfying

1:47:03.360 --> 1:47:05.120
 about not eating the croissant at all,

1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:07.380
 and just knowing that later I can eat the whole croissant.

1:47:07.380 --> 1:47:08.360
 Now that's me.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:11.560
 Other people find that they don't have any trouble

1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:13.000
 with portion control.

1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:14.820
 That for them, just eating small bits of food

1:47:14.820 --> 1:47:16.340
 throughout the day is what sets them

1:47:16.340 --> 1:47:18.600
 in the right psychological and physical state

1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:20.020
 for sake of work, et cetera.

1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:22.020
 And I mentioned work and mental focus

1:47:22.020 --> 1:47:24.340
 because one of the aspects of fasting

1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:26.060
 that have drawn a lot of people

1:47:26.060 --> 1:47:28.320
 to time-restricted feeding and fasting

1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:31.460
 is the clarity of mind that people get

1:47:31.460 --> 1:47:34.000
 when, first of all, they don't have to think about

1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:34.840
 when they're going to eat

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:37.340
 because they know when their eating window begins.

1:47:37.340 --> 1:47:39.220
 They also don't have to think about regulating

1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:42.340
 their behavior because they already know

1:47:42.340 --> 1:47:44.200
 when they're going to eat and when they're not going to eat.

1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:46.300
 Whereas when you're restricting portions,

1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:48.940
 you actually have to make decisions all the while.

1:47:48.940 --> 1:47:51.280
 You know, and I think I, like many people decide,

1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:53.380
 well, you know, is that exactly half

1:47:53.380 --> 1:47:55.580
 or could I have like another rung on the croissant,

1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:56.420
 this kind of thing.

1:47:56.420 --> 1:47:57.700
 I don't negotiate with food.

1:47:57.700 --> 1:48:00.440
 That's why I like a time-restricted feeding window.

1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:01.900
 I know I'm going to eat for, in my case,

1:48:01.900 --> 1:48:04.420
 I use a 10-hour feeding window or so.

1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:05.780
 And I'll eat the whole croissant.

1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:07.820
 I just don't have to think about it.

1:48:07.820 --> 1:48:10.140
 Now, the food choices that you make

1:48:10.140 --> 1:48:11.840
 inside of that feeding window are of course

1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:13.260
 also going to be very important.

1:48:13.260 --> 1:48:15.080
 Certain foods will increase blood glucose

1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:16.860
 such that you're going to get hungrier and hungrier.

1:48:16.860 --> 1:48:19.140
 Others will maintain lower blood glucose

1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:21.940
 and will allow you to be more controlled

1:48:21.940 --> 1:48:23.980
 in the foods that you pursue.

1:48:23.980 --> 1:48:25.820
 Those are all individual considerations

1:48:25.820 --> 1:48:28.180
 that are deserving of their own entire episode.

1:48:28.180 --> 1:48:31.100
 But I do want to point out that the advantage

1:48:31.100 --> 1:48:33.660
 of time-restricted feeding is that it involves

1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:35.700
 a lot of the decision-making in the brain,

1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:39.340
 the so-called go, no-go circuitries of our basal ganglia,

1:48:39.340 --> 1:48:41.360
 if you want to know those areas that control them.

1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:43.660
 Anytime we have to restrict a behavior,

1:48:43.660 --> 1:48:45.540
 that's called a no-go.

1:48:45.540 --> 1:48:48.320
 Anytime we engage in a behavior, that's a go.

1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:50.800
 No-go behaviors require a lot of what's called

1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:53.860
 top-down control, and it's very metabolically demanding.

1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:56.780
 And so time-restricted feeding allows you to depart

1:48:56.780 --> 1:48:59.380
 from the whole no-go, go negotiation

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:03.580
 that you have to undergo when you have to restrict portions.

1:49:03.580 --> 1:49:05.240
 And so I think this is a reason why many people

1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:07.620
 have gravitated towards time-restricted feeding

1:49:07.620 --> 1:49:10.060
 and why for people that don't want to have to think

1:49:10.060 --> 1:49:12.960
 about all that, it's just very straightforward.

1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:15.140
 One of the more hot button issues out there

1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:19.380
 is whether or not given equal amounts of caloric intake

1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:23.020
 and equal amounts of activity

1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:25.460
 and equal amounts of nutrients, et cetera,

1:49:25.460 --> 1:49:28.980
 whether or not restricting food to a particular window

1:49:28.980 --> 1:49:32.580
 biases more weight loss toward fat loss

1:49:32.580 --> 1:49:34.180
 versus loss of other tissues.

1:49:34.180 --> 1:49:35.300
 Because of course, when we lose weight,

1:49:35.300 --> 1:49:37.340
 we can lose that from any number of different

1:49:37.340 --> 1:49:41.260
 storage sites within the body, muscle, water,

1:49:41.260 --> 1:49:44.700
 glycogen, or fat.

1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:47.060
 Now, this is such a hot button issue

1:49:47.060 --> 1:49:48.140
 that I almost don't want to get into it,

1:49:48.140 --> 1:49:49.360
 but I'm going to get into it anyway,

1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:52.260
 because there are data that are very interesting.

1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:56.540
 This is covered in the review that I mentioned earlier

1:49:56.540 --> 1:50:00.180
 that describes how if people follow

1:50:00.180 --> 1:50:03.780
 a time-restricted feeding schedule for long periods of time,

1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:07.500
 so 60 days or longer, there are some metabolic changes

1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:10.840
 in the way that people metabolize energy

1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:14.620
 that do seem to shift the system toward more fat loss

1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:17.140
 relative to burning of other tissues

1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:19.120
 when in a state of caloric restriction.

1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:21.640
 And I want to say when in a state of caloric restriction,

1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:23.940
 because there's really no way to cheat the system.

1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:26.200
 There's no way that you can ingest far more calories

1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:28.080
 than you burn or excrete.

1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:31.380
 When I say excrete, you know, I certainly don't suggest this,

1:50:31.380 --> 1:50:34.100
 but there, you know, bulimics and other people

1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:35.900
 that have eating disorders will use laxatives

1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:38.100
 as a way to eliminate food quickly from their system

1:50:38.100 --> 1:50:41.700
 so it can't be converted into fat or other forms of energy.

1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:45.480
 That's a very, in that case, it's a pathological situation,

1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:48.020
 but in general, calories in versus calories out,

1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:50.700
 as I mentioned earlier, is this kind of foundational element

1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:53.260
 but in states of caloric restriction,

1:50:53.260 --> 1:50:55.340
 meaning sub-maintenance intake,

1:50:55.340 --> 1:50:59.940
 time restricted feeding does seem to bias

1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:03.700
 more of the energy burned to compensate

1:51:03.700 --> 1:51:05.800
 for that deficit from fat.

1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:08.560
 And the way it accomplishes it is very interesting.

1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:11.460
 It turns out that it drives more fat loss

1:51:11.460 --> 1:51:14.180
 by way of increasing a hepatic lipase.

1:51:14.180 --> 1:51:15.780
 This is something called LIPC,

1:51:15.780 --> 1:51:18.300
 hepatic means of the liver and lipase,

1:51:18.300 --> 1:51:22.300
 which anytime you hear ASE is means it's an enzyme.

1:51:22.300 --> 1:51:24.820
 So it seems to increase hepatic lipase.

1:51:24.820 --> 1:51:28.300
 So it increases the enzyme that metabolizes fat

1:51:28.300 --> 1:51:30.260
 for lipolysis and energy production

1:51:30.260 --> 1:51:34.380
 and reduces something called CIDEC, C-I-D-E-C,

1:51:34.380 --> 1:51:38.620
 which is a lipid droplet associated and lipolysis inhibitor.

1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:41.260
 Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended,

1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:44.440
 but what CIDEC really is,

1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:47.420
 this lipid droplet associated molecule

1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:50.380
 is it can inhibit lipolysis.

1:51:50.380 --> 1:51:54.340
 So extended periods of time restricted feeding,

1:51:54.340 --> 1:51:57.940
 meaning eight hour feeding window or 10 hour feeding window

1:51:57.940 --> 1:52:01.380
 that's obeyed for several months or more

1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:06.380
 seems to allow the system to shift toward burning more fat

1:52:07.140 --> 1:52:10.820
 or rather using a higher percentage of fat

1:52:10.820 --> 1:52:13.140
 when in a caloric deficit.

1:52:13.140 --> 1:52:15.580
 Now, I doubt that this is going to resolve

1:52:15.580 --> 1:52:17.500
 the truly barbed wire,

1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:19.960
 almost hairball ridiculous online debates

1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:21.780
 about whether or not time restricted feeding

1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:23.340
 is better than another feeding schedule.

1:52:23.340 --> 1:52:25.460
 Look, I don't think any particular feeding schedule

1:52:25.460 --> 1:52:26.460
 is holy.

1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:27.860
 If you are sub caloric,

1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:30.140
 meaning fewer calories burned than calories ingested,

1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:31.560
 you're going to lose weight.

1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:33.460
 But the data seemed to point to the fact

1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:35.260
 that if you do time restricted feeding

1:52:35.260 --> 1:52:37.620
 for a fairly long duration of time,

1:52:37.620 --> 1:52:39.020
 and you maintain that,

1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:41.060
 that you are increasing these lipases

1:52:41.060 --> 1:52:45.820
 that increase lipolysis, energy use from fat,

1:52:45.820 --> 1:52:48.160
 and you're decreasing the lipid droplet

1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:50.300
 associated lipolysis inhibitors.

1:52:50.300 --> 1:52:51.780
 So it's both a,

1:52:51.780 --> 1:52:53.700
 you're removing the break and you're pressing

1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:55.820
 on the accelerator of fat loss.

1:52:55.820 --> 1:52:59.860
 I think that this logically points to a case

1:52:59.860 --> 1:53:02.820
 in which using time restricted feeding

1:53:02.820 --> 1:53:05.860
 with a sub caloric intake seems to be,

1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:07.220
 at least to my mind,

1:53:07.220 --> 1:53:09.300
 the most scientifically supported way

1:53:09.300 --> 1:53:12.980
 to ensure that a significant portion of the weight

1:53:12.980 --> 1:53:15.520
 that one loses is from body fat stores.

1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:18.700
 Any discussion about fasting would be incomplete

1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:20.580
 without a discussion about what does

1:53:20.580 --> 1:53:23.100
 and does not break a fast.

1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:26.060
 However, there is no black and white answer

1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:27.040
 to that question.

1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:29.820
 And you should immediately understand why.

1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:33.820
 It's because eating and not eating

1:53:33.820 --> 1:53:36.660
 are not equivalent to fed and fasted.

1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:38.900
 It depends on when you ate,

1:53:38.900 --> 1:53:43.900
 how much you ate and where you are in your circadian cycle.

1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:46.780
 We can actually arrive at a simple answer

1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:49.140
 to whether or not something breaks the fast or not.

1:53:49.140 --> 1:53:50.560
 Now, the technical way to go about this,

1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:53.280
 would be to wear a continuous glucose monitor

1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:56.220
 and to ingest little bits of food of different kinds

1:53:56.220 --> 1:53:58.260
 or large amounts of food of different kinds

1:53:58.260 --> 1:53:59.820
 and measure blood glucose,

1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:02.860
 because ultimately blood glucose is the readout

1:54:02.860 --> 1:54:05.380
 of whether or not your system is in a fed or fasted state.

1:54:05.380 --> 1:54:06.940
 There are other parameters too, of course,

1:54:06.940 --> 1:54:08.580
 but that's the dominant one.

1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:13.440
 In so far as the scientific literature says,

1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:17.560
 drinking water will not break your fast.

1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:21.660
 Drinking tea will not break your fast.

1:54:21.660 --> 1:54:23.940
 Drinking coffee provided it is black coffee

1:54:23.940 --> 1:54:25.320
 will not break your fast.

1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:30.840
 Ingesting caffeine in pill form will not break your fast.

1:54:30.840 --> 1:54:33.200
 There are other things that won't break your fast.

1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:35.300
 For instance, eating one peanut

1:54:35.300 --> 1:54:38.880
 when deep in a fasted state will not break your fast.

1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:40.300
 Eating a whole handful of peanuts

1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:41.780
 might not even break your fast

1:54:41.780 --> 1:54:44.740
 if you are in a very low glucose state.

1:54:44.740 --> 1:54:46.340
 However, if you just finished a meal

1:54:46.340 --> 1:54:47.960
 that included carbohydrates

1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:52.000
 or it was a very large meal of any kind an hour ago,

1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.800
 yes, indeed, eating one peanut could break your fast.

1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:57.840
 So it's all contextual.

1:54:57.840 --> 1:54:59.720
 That's what's really important to understand.

1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:02.780
 Unless you're going to wear a continuous glucose monitor

1:55:02.780 --> 1:55:05.860
 and unless you're going to wear a continuous glucose monitor

1:55:05.860 --> 1:55:08.900
 and set an absolute numerical threshold

1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:11.340
 for what it is to break your fast,

1:55:11.340 --> 1:55:14.040
 I think there are some simple rules that we can follow.

1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:19.040
 First of all, anything that involves sugar,

1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:20.500
 in particular, simple sugars

1:55:20.500 --> 1:55:21.820
 can potentially break your fast.

1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:23.380
 And there's actually a study on this

1:55:23.380 --> 1:55:27.720
 which shows that if people ingest even one,

1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.260
 one gram of sugar post dinner,

1:55:31.260 --> 1:55:33.400
 if they had a full meal for dinner,

1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:36.140
 that can actually disrupt the expression

1:55:36.140 --> 1:55:39.660
 of some of the circadian genes related to fasting

1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:41.920
 and to sleep and sleep-related fasting.

1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:43.180
 Now that's pretty extreme.

1:55:43.180 --> 1:55:45.480
 It's almost kind of scary to think about,

1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.540
 but that's how sensitive our system is

1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:50.700
 if we already have somewhat elevated blood glucose

1:55:50.700 --> 1:55:53.420
 from a meal that we ate an hour or so ago.

1:55:53.420 --> 1:55:57.020
 Whereas if we have run for an hour

1:55:57.020 --> 1:56:00.000
 or trained hard high-intensity training

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.060
 and we haven't quite reached the beginning

1:56:02.060 --> 1:56:04.400
 of our so-called feeding window,

1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:09.400
 will eating a small amount of food take us out of that fast?

1:56:09.860 --> 1:56:11.880
 Well, depends on what the food is.

1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:14.660
 If it's mostly fat, probably not.

1:56:14.660 --> 1:56:15.980
 A number of people out there nowadays

1:56:15.980 --> 1:56:17.740
 talk about so-called fat fasting.

1:56:17.740 --> 1:56:20.960
 Fat fasting is a way to kind of wriggle past

1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:25.260
 the stringency of either eating or not eating

1:56:25.260 --> 1:56:28.240
 as a black and white rule for feeding window

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:29.640
 versus non-feeding window.

1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:33.380
 So some people will ingest medium chain triglycerides,

1:56:33.380 --> 1:56:36.800
 so-called MCTs, or people will ingest fats only

1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:38.940
 until their official feeding window begins.

1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:40.860
 So these are sort of how the negotiations

1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:42.860
 that people carry out tend to go.

1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:45.720
 But fat, of course, won't increase blood glucose

1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:47.880
 and insulin as much as carbohydrates will.

1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:50.900
 Protein will have sort of an intermediate effect.

1:56:50.900 --> 1:56:52.060
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:54.300
 ingesting carbohydrates with some fat

1:56:54.300 --> 1:56:57.060
 will tend to blunt the rise in glucose

1:56:57.060 --> 1:57:00.380
 and will extend the duration over which glucose is released.

1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:04.460
 So we really can't say food X

1:57:04.460 --> 1:57:07.380
 or beverage X breaks a fast.

1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.900
 However, at the extremes, we can say that.

1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:13.700
 For instance, if you drink a can of soda pop,

1:57:13.700 --> 1:57:16.040
 unless you just ran an ultra marathon,

1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:17.780
 you're breaking your fast, okay?

1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:19.960
 Eat a piece of pizza, you're breaking your fast.

1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:23.620
 If you eat purely fats, maybe, probably not.

1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:27.020
 If you've been fasting for five hours or more,

1:57:27.020 --> 1:57:29.100
 strictly fasting for five hours or more.

1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:32.020
 So you can start to see where there's a lot of wiggle room

1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:33.500
 and it's very contextual.

1:57:33.500 --> 1:57:36.120
 And this is why any posts that you see

1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:38.180
 or any information that you see that something does

1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:40.100
 or does not break your fast that doesn't place it

1:57:40.100 --> 1:57:43.500
 in the context of when the last time you ate

1:57:43.500 --> 1:57:46.700
 and what you ate and your activity

1:57:46.700 --> 1:57:49.180
 and your time within the circadian clock schedule

1:57:49.180 --> 1:57:52.520
 of 24 hours, it's a sort of meaningless discussion.

1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:54.740
 So in general, I think what's really useful

1:57:54.740 --> 1:57:57.540
 if you're not going to wear a continuous glucose monitor

1:57:57.540 --> 1:57:59.760
 is to try and be fairly strict

1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:01.740
 about when you initiate your feeding window

1:58:01.740 --> 1:58:03.420
 and when you stop your feeding window.

1:58:03.420 --> 1:58:06.820
 And as time evolves and you establish a more regular routine

1:58:06.820 --> 1:58:08.600
 of eating certain kinds of foods and not others

1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:09.440
 that are right for you,

1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:11.660
 because as I've emphasized before on this podcast

1:58:11.660 --> 1:58:13.180
 and I will continue to emphasize,

1:58:13.180 --> 1:58:15.140
 keto works great for some people,

1:58:15.140 --> 1:58:17.260
 vegetarian keto works great for some people,

1:58:17.260 --> 1:58:20.220
 carnivore diet works great for other people.

1:58:20.220 --> 1:58:22.660
 Some people are omnivores, some people are carnivores,

1:58:22.660 --> 1:58:24.460
 some people are vegan.

1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:26.280
 All of that is great and fine by me.

1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:27.980
 Everyone has to establish what's right for them.

1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:31.260
 Today, we've really bypassed the discussion

1:58:31.260 --> 1:58:34.700
 about foods of a particular origin or type,

1:58:34.700 --> 1:58:36.260
 animal-based or plant-based,

1:58:36.260 --> 1:58:39.620
 but all the same rules apply within this thing

1:58:39.620 --> 1:58:41.500
 that we're call intermittent fasting

1:58:41.500 --> 1:58:42.740
 or time-restricted feeding.

1:58:42.740 --> 1:58:46.540
 So what breaks a fast will depend and what you want to eat

1:58:46.540 --> 1:58:48.220
 or what you are willing to eat,

1:58:48.220 --> 1:58:51.320
 that's a totally separate manner from when you eat.

1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:55.220
 But as we've established, when you eat is vitally important.

1:58:55.220 --> 1:58:57.820
 Some of you are probably wondering whether or not

1:58:57.820 --> 1:59:01.460
 artificial sweeteners or non-artificial plant-based

1:59:01.460 --> 1:59:04.400
 sweeteners like stevia break a fast.

1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:06.880
 This will vary somewhat.

1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:10.700
 And I have to say the data on this are somewhat mixed.

1:59:10.700 --> 1:59:14.320
 There is evidence that when people ingest

1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:15.520
 artificial sweeteners,

1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:19.160
 that it can create a transient increase in blood glucose

1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:22.240
 followed by a transient decrease in blood glucose

1:59:22.240 --> 1:59:23.880
 below baseline.

1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:26.280
 This is thought to explain the increase in hunger

1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:29.100
 caused by ingestion of things like aspartame and sucralose

1:59:29.100 --> 1:59:30.360
 and things of that sort.

1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:32.420
 There are not a lot of good studies

1:59:32.420 --> 1:59:36.360
 exploring the plant-based non sugar sweeteners,

1:59:36.360 --> 1:59:39.360
 things like stevia, even things like monk fruit,

1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:41.680
 which is a separate category into itself.

1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:43.040
 There aren't a lot of studies on this.

1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:45.540
 I think most people need to establish this for themselves.

1:59:45.540 --> 1:59:46.380
 The best way of course,

1:59:46.380 --> 1:59:48.640
 would be to wear a continuous glucose monitor

1:59:48.640 --> 1:59:51.280
 to go into a fasted state of either one hour or two hours,

1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:52.600
 or maybe you've been fasting all night

1:59:52.600 --> 1:59:55.600
 and then ingest stevia in whatever form you want

1:59:55.600 --> 1:59:59.000
 or coffee in whatever form you want with sucralose

1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:00.440
 or aspartame, et cetera,

2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:02.880
 setting aside the discussion about the effects

2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:04.720
 of these things on the gut microbiome,

2:00:04.720 --> 2:00:07.160
 which is a different topic entirely.

2:00:07.160 --> 2:00:10.020
 I think it's fair to say that in moderation,

2:00:10.020 --> 2:00:13.800
 the plant-based non sugar sweeteners like stevia

2:00:13.800 --> 2:00:17.160
 in particular stevia seem to have a minimal impact

2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:18.640
 on overall blood glucose

2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:20.920
 when considered over a fairly large time bin.

2:00:21.840 --> 2:00:24.680
 Aspartame and sucralose, saccharin,

2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:26.080
 I think we can say more or less the same,

2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:27.940
 but as soon as you get into a discussion about those,

2:00:27.940 --> 2:00:29.440
 you also have to get into a discussion

2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:32.940
 about some of the evidence published in nature

2:00:32.940 --> 2:00:35.120
 and other excellent journals now,

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:37.920
 pointing to the fact that when consumed in excess,

2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:39.960
 not when consumed in moderation,

2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:41.200
 but when consumed in excess,

2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:42.900
 that those might have some detrimental effects

2:00:42.900 --> 2:00:44.560
 on the gut microbiome.

2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:48.240
 So do artificial sweeteners break a fast?

2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:50.360
 Depends on the amount, depends on the type.

2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:52.960
 And in general, I think you're probably okay,

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:56.160
 provided that you're not indulging in them too often.

2:00:56.160 --> 2:00:57.760
 However, some people,

2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:00.400
 just by virtue of tasting something sweet,

2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:02.780
 feel a spike in their appetite that makes it harder

2:01:02.780 --> 2:01:04.720
 for them to adhere to the feeding window.

2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:06.460
 And so this is why you can imagine

2:01:06.460 --> 2:01:08.940
 that a really well controlled study on this

2:01:08.940 --> 2:01:10.280
 would be very hard to carry out.

2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:12.580
 And I'm not really sure that it's worth our tax dollars

2:01:12.580 --> 2:01:15.500
 to actually design and carry out a study like that,

2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:18.140
 because there would be so much individual variation

2:01:18.140 --> 2:01:21.360
 in terms of discipline in adhering to the feeding window,

2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:23.200
 whether or not people experience increases

2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:25.280
 and drops in blood glucose, how that impacts them,

2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:26.340
 whether or not they're exercising,

2:01:26.340 --> 2:01:29.960
 it just becomes an infinite variable space, as we say,

2:01:29.960 --> 2:01:31.320
 in experimental science.

2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:33.040
 So you really have to determine that for you.

2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:36.480
 But I don't think that we can fairly say

2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:38.640
 that artificial sweeteners break a fast.

2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:40.560
 I think that would be incorrect to say.

2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:43.480
 Earlier, we were talking about glucose disposal agents,

2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:46.600
 both behavioral and compound based,

2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:48.160
 things like metformin and berberine.

2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:52.080
 And in fact, cinnamon is even a mild glucose disposal agent.

2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:54.320
 It can actually reduce blood glucose.

2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:56.600
 Lemon and lime juice, believe it or not,

2:01:56.600 --> 2:01:58.480
 can lower blood glucose.

2:01:58.480 --> 2:01:59.800
 You may have experienced this before

2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:01.440
 of eating something very, very sweet

2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:03.000
 and almost feeling kind of overwhelmed

2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:04.800
 and kind of poisoned by how sweet it is,

2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:06.440
 especially if you're not accustomed

2:02:06.440 --> 2:02:09.040
 to eating a lot of sugary things.

2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:12.240
 One quick remedy for that is actually a half lime

2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:15.080
 or a half lemon squeezed into juice and drinking that

2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:19.000
 just by virtue of the taste and by virtue of the fact

2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:20.920
 that it will reduce blood glucose,

2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:22.220
 you'll notice that that effect

2:02:22.220 --> 2:02:24.100
 almost immediately disappears.

2:02:24.100 --> 2:02:25.200
 That's not magic.

2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:28.900
 That's the effects of acidity on blood glucose levels.

2:02:28.900 --> 2:02:29.840
 So there are a number of things

2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:32.400
 that can adjust blood glucose.

2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:34.040
 They're not necessarily disposal agents.

2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:36.040
 They're not sweeping it out of the bloodstream

2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:38.120
 in the same way that berberine or metformin would,

2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:39.920
 or that high intensity exercise

2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:41.640
 at the appropriate times of day would.

2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:45.580
 But there is one particular thing that one can ingest

2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:50.580
 that can help manage psychologically and performance wise

2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:55.060
 through the fasting portion of the intermittent fasting

2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:57.220
 and get you to your feeding window.

2:02:57.220 --> 2:02:59.140
 And that's salt.

2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:01.460
 I've talked a little bit about this on the podcast before,

2:03:01.460 --> 2:03:06.380
 but because neurons use salt, sodium and potassium

2:03:06.380 --> 2:03:08.520
 and magnesium, the so-called electrolytes

2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:10.500
 in order to perform their magic

2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:12.140
 of chemical and electrical signaling,

2:03:12.140 --> 2:03:13.560
 everything you do depends on chemical

2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:15.480
 and electrical signaling and all that chemical

2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:18.680
 and electrical signaling requires electrolytes

2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:19.820
 in some form or another.

2:03:19.820 --> 2:03:24.420
 Neurons run on the passage of ions like sodium

2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:27.820
 in and out of their cell membranes,

2:03:27.820 --> 2:03:31.240
 or I should say across their cell membranes to be accurate.

2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:34.020
 Many people find that the kind of lightheadedness,

2:03:34.020 --> 2:03:36.420
 the shakiness that's accustomed

2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:40.540
 with having slightly low blood sugar can be offset

2:03:40.540 --> 2:03:44.620
 by taking a half teaspoon or so of sea salt,

2:03:44.620 --> 2:03:46.300
 or even just a tiny pinch of salt

2:03:46.300 --> 2:03:50.220
 and putting into some water and drinking it.

2:03:50.220 --> 2:03:54.300
 Some people find because of the glucose lowering effects

2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:56.420
 of acidity that if they're feeling kind of shaky

2:03:56.420 --> 2:03:59.140
 and not well, and they put some lemon juice into water

2:03:59.140 --> 2:04:01.880
 and drink that it drops their blood glucose further.

2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:04.340
 So there's a common practice nowadays

2:04:04.340 --> 2:04:05.980
 that's discussed on the internet of waking up,

2:04:05.980 --> 2:04:08.660
 drinking some water with some lime or lemon juice in it

2:04:08.660 --> 2:04:09.960
 with a little pinch of salt.

2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:12.100
 I think that little pinch of salt is a good idea.

2:04:12.100 --> 2:04:12.940
 What is it doing?

2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:14.120
 How is it offsetting all this?

2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:18.040
 Well, saltwater actually has a mild effect

2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:20.020
 as a glucose disposal agent,

2:04:20.020 --> 2:04:23.420
 but it has a stabilizing effect on blood volume.

2:04:23.420 --> 2:04:26.800
 And so because sodium brings with it water

2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:30.660
 and the so-called osmolarity of your blood and your body

2:04:30.660 --> 2:04:34.220
 depends on the salt levels in your blood

2:04:34.220 --> 2:04:35.860
 and brain and body.

2:04:35.860 --> 2:04:38.040
 Many people find that if they're feeling shaky,

2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:39.780
 they're feeling lightheaded, they can't concentrate.

2:04:39.780 --> 2:04:41.400
 They think they need sugar or food,

2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:44.540
 but what will actually remedy that is some salt.

2:04:44.540 --> 2:04:45.700
 And I know a number of people

2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:47.060
 that have incorporated this practice

2:04:47.060 --> 2:04:48.560
 and have written to me and saying, oh, you know,

2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:50.780
 if I just take a little bit of salt and some water,

2:04:50.780 --> 2:04:52.500
 they may or may not include the lemon or lime juice.

2:04:52.500 --> 2:04:54.020
 They immediately feel better

2:04:54.020 --> 2:04:56.060
 and find that it's actually quite straightforward

2:04:56.060 --> 2:04:58.060
 to get out to that,

2:04:58.060 --> 2:05:00.660
 to wait until the feeding window kicks in.

2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:03.940
 This is especially true for people that are using caffeine

2:05:03.940 --> 2:05:05.180
 because when you ingest caffeine,

2:05:05.180 --> 2:05:07.100
 you actually excrete a lot of water,

2:05:07.100 --> 2:05:08.300
 has a diuretic effect.

2:05:08.300 --> 2:05:10.160
 And with that water goes salt.

2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:12.580
 So it actually causes you to excrete sodium.

2:05:12.580 --> 2:05:15.580
 Now, the role of sodium in blood pressure

2:05:15.580 --> 2:05:18.780
 and hypertension is, you know, quite controversial.

2:05:18.780 --> 2:05:19.640
 Science Magazine,

2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:23.460
 one of the premier scientific journals out there

2:05:23.460 --> 2:05:26.040
 had a special issue all about salt some years ago,

2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:28.580
 talking about the research around hypertension.

2:05:28.580 --> 2:05:30.540
 Indeed people with chronic hypertension

2:05:30.540 --> 2:05:31.520
 or high blood pressure,

2:05:31.520 --> 2:05:33.160
 or very high blood pressure in particular,

2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:35.500
 should be wary of ingesting too much sodium.

2:05:35.500 --> 2:05:37.440
 But for most people,

2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:40.520
 ingesting sodium provided they drink enough water

2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:42.400
 and they don't have chronic hypertension

2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:45.840
 or high blood pressure is actually beneficial.

2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:47.220
 That doesn't mean you should be drinking seawater,

2:05:47.220 --> 2:05:50.280
 doesn't mean you should be overindulging in salt,

2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:53.100
 but many people find that they can manage

2:05:53.100 --> 2:05:54.480
 their mental and physical state

2:05:54.480 --> 2:05:57.980
 and even feel really terrific, real clarity of mind,

2:05:57.980 --> 2:06:00.020
 and really enjoy their fast

2:06:00.020 --> 2:06:01.640
 when they're ingesting sufficient salt.

2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:03.660
 And all it requires really is a small pinch of salt,

2:06:03.660 --> 2:06:05.000
 ideally Himalayan or sea salt,

2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:06.140
 if you want to get fancy about it,

2:06:06.140 --> 2:06:08.040
 but table salt would be fine.

2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:11.120
 And just drinking that in some water,

2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:12.320
 maybe with lemon or lime juice

2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:14.520
 to offset the taste a little bit,

2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:17.500
 can really stabilize one's jitters

2:06:17.500 --> 2:06:19.120
 and can stabilize the mind.

2:06:19.120 --> 2:06:23.720
 And you might also notice can offset that churning

2:06:23.720 --> 2:06:25.560
 and yearning and appetite

2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:27.640
 where you can't imagine going another five minutes

2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:28.560
 before eating something,

2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:29.480
 suddenly you feel okay.

2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:32.400
 And that has to do with a lot of the effects of blood volume

2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:35.360
 caused by ingesting salt in the appropriate amounts.

2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:38.160
 In other words, sometimes you think you need food,

2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:39.600
 but what you really need is salt

2:06:39.600 --> 2:06:41.920
 and salt can make you feel better immediately.

2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:45.260
 I'd like to mention two excellent zero cost resources.

2:06:45.260 --> 2:06:47.640
 If you're going to explore time restricted feeding,

2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:50.840
 or maybe if you already are doing time restricted feeding,

2:06:51.680 --> 2:06:53.800
 I have no affiliation to either of these.

2:06:53.800 --> 2:06:55.880
 The first is the website that I mentioned before,

2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:56.960
 My Circadian Clock,

2:06:56.960 --> 2:07:00.400
 which is the website hosted by Sachin Panda and colleagues.

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:01.860
 There are a lot of resources there

2:07:01.860 --> 2:07:03.460
 where you can log your food intake,

2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:05.260
 get information about time restricted feeding,

2:07:05.260 --> 2:07:08.260
 all the science, the ongoing studies, et cetera.

2:07:08.260 --> 2:07:10.940
 The other is the so-called zero app

2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:14.940
 that makes it very easy to mark

2:07:16.280 --> 2:07:18.080
 when you're beginning your feeding window

2:07:18.080 --> 2:07:19.440
 and when you're ending your feeding window.

2:07:19.440 --> 2:07:20.560
 And in so doing,

2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:22.360
 marking when you are beginning your fast

2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:23.360
 and ending your fast,

2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:27.580
 or at least initiating the beginning of the unfed state,

2:07:27.580 --> 2:07:29.560
 as we could more accurately call it.

2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:30.580
 It's a terrific app.

2:07:30.580 --> 2:07:31.960
 I've used it from time to time.

2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:34.900
 I don't tend to use it in an ongoing basis

2:07:34.900 --> 2:07:36.560
 because I'm just sort of used to eating

2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:38.640
 at a particular time of day now.

2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:41.240
 But anytime I've shifted that window,

2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:42.880
 for instance, a few weeks ago,

2:07:42.880 --> 2:07:44.660
 I started moving that protein intake

2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:47.160
 and my entire feeding window earlier in the day.

2:07:47.160 --> 2:07:49.960
 And because that takes some attention on my part,

2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:51.640
 because I'm not used to doing that,

2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:54.080
 I've been using the zero app and I like it quite a lot.

2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:56.080
 It logs your progress and it gives you averages

2:07:56.080 --> 2:07:57.860
 and you can see how many other people are fasting.

2:07:57.860 --> 2:07:59.380
 Again, totally zero cost.

2:07:59.380 --> 2:08:01.120
 I actually don't know who owns that app,

2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:03.120
 but I think they've done an excellent job.

2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:04.600
 The interface is really terrific.

2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:07.360
 And as far as I know, it's available for Apple and Android,

2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:09.320
 but it's at least available for Apple phones,

2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:11.480
 which is the type of phone I happen to have.

2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:13.120
 So check those out.

2:08:13.120 --> 2:08:15.480
 My circadian clock, you just put that into Google,

2:08:15.480 --> 2:08:16.320
 you'll find it.

2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:20.520
 And the zero app, both excellent zero cost resources.

2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:22.880
 In a moment, I'd like to review the parameters

2:08:22.880 --> 2:08:26.900
 of a ideal feeding schedule for you

2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:29.020
 and give you the variables that you can plug in

2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:31.540
 to your lifestyle and your preferences.

2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:33.020
 There are a couple of things that I would place

2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:36.220
 into the category of frequently asked,

2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:40.100
 somewhat odd, but still worthy of discussion.

2:08:40.100 --> 2:08:42.600
 For instance, people have asked,

2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:45.640
 will brushing your teeth with toothpaste break your fast?

2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:49.540
 I think unless you're swallowing the toothpaste, no.

2:08:49.540 --> 2:08:50.820
 Now, if you really want to run out

2:08:50.820 --> 2:08:53.020
 and get a continuous glucose monitor and brush your teeth,

2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:54.240
 then you can evaluate that.

2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:57.200
 But no, people have asked,

2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:59.620
 will a half glass of wine after dinner,

2:08:59.620 --> 2:09:01.640
 a couple hours after dinner, break your fast?

2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:03.700
 Absolutely, it absolutely will.

2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:05.920
 And it's been demonstrated to do that

2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:08.640
 based on the one gram of sugar,

2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:11.800
 kind of eerie or scary effect that I talked about before.

2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:15.120
 Scary and eerie because it just seems like one gram of sugar.

2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:15.960
 How could it do that?

2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:18.160
 But these are metabolic processes

2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:21.780
 and they are very sensitive post meal.

2:09:21.780 --> 2:09:22.800
 A few months back,

2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:26.460
 I did an experiment wearing a continuous glucose monitor.

2:09:26.460 --> 2:09:29.240
 And I got a surprise when I discovered

2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:32.460
 that going into a sauna increases my blood glucose

2:09:32.460 --> 2:09:35.480
 quite a bit, it actually spikes it as high as a meal.

2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:37.840
 And then it tends to drop back down to baseline

2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:40.640
 or even slightly below baseline afterwards.

2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:43.820
 When I talk to people about this, somebody said,

2:09:43.820 --> 2:09:46.780
 oh, it's got to be that the continuous glucose monitor

2:09:46.780 --> 2:09:48.840
 was getting disrupted by the heat in the sauna.

2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:50.720
 That's actually not the case.

2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:54.020
 Turns out that when you go in a sauna,

2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:57.660
 because you dehydrate, you're losing water.

2:09:57.660 --> 2:10:00.320
 I wasn't drinking water and you're dropping a lot of water.

2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:03.520
 The concentration of sugar in your blood actually goes up.

2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:06.160
 And I actually put these data out

2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:08.460
 in a social media post on Twitter

2:10:08.460 --> 2:10:10.440
 and people were kind of shocked to see

2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:13.320
 how much a sauna can spike your blood glucose.

2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:15.760
 Now I do practice time restricted feeding,

2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:16.600
 intermittent fasting.

2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:17.900
 I'm not super strict about it.

2:10:17.900 --> 2:10:21.320
 I use a kind of eight to 10 hour ish window

2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:23.700
 either early in the day or late in the day.

2:10:23.700 --> 2:10:25.560
 I saw this effect of the sauna.

2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:30.460
 Personally, the psychological and physical health effects

2:10:30.460 --> 2:10:33.160
 of the sauna are valuable enough to me

2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:34.460
 that I continue to use it.

2:10:34.460 --> 2:10:37.400
 I just not concerned about this increase in blood glucose

2:10:37.400 --> 2:10:39.560
 to the extent that I'm going to eliminate sauna.

2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:41.860
 I like to use the sauna three or four times a week

2:10:41.860 --> 2:10:43.240
 before sleep.

2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:44.840
 So I'll use it an hour or two before sleep.

2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:47.640
 And yes, indeed, it creates this big spike in blood glucose

2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:49.580
 that then drops based on change

2:10:49.580 --> 2:10:51.860
 in the concentration of blood sugar.

2:10:51.860 --> 2:10:53.000
 I'm just not going to worry about it.

2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.760
 Now, if you're concerned about blood glucose spikes,

2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:57.440
 then you might be worried about it.

2:10:57.440 --> 2:10:59.360
 But in my case, it was one of those things

2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:00.820
 where it was interesting

2:11:00.820 --> 2:11:03.240
 and it was worthy of discussion, I thought,

2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:04.580
 because it was somewhat surprising to me,

2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:06.820
 although it makes perfect sense why this would be the case.

2:11:06.820 --> 2:11:09.360
 But at the end of the day, literally,

2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:11.800
 it just makes sense for me to get in the sauna.

2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:13.680
 Okay, so now you've heard a lot of science.

2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:17.000
 You've heard a lot of examples, even a few anecdotes,

2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:22.000
 and let's come up with the ideal intermittent fasting

2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.480
 AKA time-restricted feeding schedule for you.

2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:28.360
 And when I say ideal, I mean,

2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.680
 what are the variables that are negotiable?

2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:33.320
 What are the ones that are non-negotiable?

2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:36.400
 What is ideal for you will depend on the context

2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:40.160
 of your life and what you are willing to do consistently.

2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:44.060
 So first of all, we established,

2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:46.080
 based on the discussion with Sachin,

2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:49.820
 who is truly the premier world expert in this area,

2:11:49.820 --> 2:11:53.580
 who knows the animal and human scientific literature

2:11:53.580 --> 2:11:56.240
 better than anybody, has written this incredible review

2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:57.600
 and for whom I consulted,

2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.600
 that you do not want to ingest food for at least,

2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:06.760
 I want to emphasize, at least 60 minutes post waking up.

2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:12.920
 Second, you want to avoid ingesting any food of any kind,

2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:15.240
 even one gram of sugar.

2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:17.000
 Remember, this is the ideal.

2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.640
 One gram of sugar even would be too much.

2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:22.860
 For the two to three hours prior to bedtime.

2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:25.080
 He also mentioned,

2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:28.480
 ideally you are spending eight hours in bed.

2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:31.020
 I didn't tell you that earlier, I saved that for now,

2:12:31.020 --> 2:12:34.400
 but ideally you are sleeping that entire eight hours,

2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:36.720
 but simply by being in bed for that eight hours

2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:39.040
 and avoiding food after waking for an hour

2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:42.640
 and before bed for two to three hours,

2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:44.200
 you're starting to build out the duration

2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:46.020
 of this fasted period.

2:12:46.020 --> 2:12:51.020
 Remember that the sleep related fasting

2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:54.720
 is particularly important for the health benefits

2:12:54.720 --> 2:12:56.800
 of time restricted feeding.

2:12:56.800 --> 2:12:59.860
 Again, the sleep related fasting is especially important

2:13:00.980 --> 2:13:03.560
 because of all the cellular repair processes

2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:06.420
 that occur in the liver, in the gut, in the microbiome,

2:13:06.420 --> 2:13:08.840
 in the brain, all over the body.

2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:10.480
 And because of the way that that coordinates

2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:12.660
 the expression of the clock genes

2:13:12.660 --> 2:13:14.320
 that are then going to wick out

2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:17.680
 and have many other positive effects on health,

2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:20.560
 including weight and fat loss.

2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:23.100
 But in addition to that, liver health, et cetera.

2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:28.100
 An eight hour feeding window as a target

2:13:28.100 --> 2:13:31.880
 seems to be the best target feeding window,

2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:33.660
 at least by my read of the literature

2:13:33.660 --> 2:13:36.000
 and in discussing it with such in.

2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.280
 Shorter feeding windows of four to six hours

2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:40.200
 tend to lead to overeating

2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:42.420
 and potentially increases in weight.

2:13:42.420 --> 2:13:47.420
 One meal per day type eating do not seem to do that,

2:13:48.340 --> 2:13:52.100
 but those are special cases in that most people

2:13:52.100 --> 2:13:55.780
 can't adhere to a one meal per day type schedule,

2:13:55.780 --> 2:13:57.120
 at least not on a regular basis.

2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:00.100
 And it's not very compatible with most social schedules.

2:14:00.100 --> 2:14:02.480
 Although some people may be able to adhere to that

2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:03.320
 in a straightforward way,

2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:06.680
 but there aren't any robust studies exploring

2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:09.340
 the advantages of one meal per day.

2:14:09.340 --> 2:14:12.580
 So if you feel there are advantages of one meal per day

2:14:12.580 --> 2:14:16.020
 for you, as opposed to an eight hour feeding window,

2:14:16.020 --> 2:14:19.500
 well then by all means, use a one meal per day approach

2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:22.160
 or use a four to six hour feeding window

2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:24.700
 and just make sure you don't overeat in that window.

2:14:26.140 --> 2:14:30.400
 Remember that most people tend to not adhere

2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:31.620
 to the eight hour feeding window.

2:14:31.620 --> 2:14:32.820
 They say eight hours,

2:14:32.820 --> 2:14:35.400
 but they tend to eat outside of the eight hours

2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:37.100
 a little bit on each side.

2:14:37.100 --> 2:14:41.340
 So if your goal is a 10 hour feeding window,

2:14:41.340 --> 2:14:44.260
 you might want to set it to nine hours or eight hours.

2:14:44.260 --> 2:14:45.500
 If your goal is six hours,

2:14:45.500 --> 2:14:47.580
 you might want to set it to seven or eight hours.

2:14:47.580 --> 2:14:49.980
 And this is simply based, or I shouldn't say simply,

2:14:49.980 --> 2:14:54.040
 this is based on thousands, if not tens of thousands

2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:56.700
 of human subject data points

2:14:56.700 --> 2:14:58.800
 that Sachin and colleagues have collected.

2:15:00.740 --> 2:15:03.260
 Regular placement of the eating window

2:15:03.260 --> 2:15:08.260
 or feeding window every 24 hours is important.

2:15:08.300 --> 2:15:10.340
 You don't have to be absolutely rigid

2:15:10.340 --> 2:15:11.820
 and neurotic about this,

2:15:11.820 --> 2:15:14.060
 but you don't want it sliding around on the weekend

2:15:14.060 --> 2:15:15.660
 so that it's starting two hours later

2:15:15.660 --> 2:15:19.020
 and ending two hours later a couple of days a week,

2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:21.780
 because then you start to offset

2:15:21.780 --> 2:15:23.800
 many of the positive health effects

2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:27.200
 that have been demonstrated for time restricted feeding.

2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:31.260
 Remember if you eat your food

2:15:31.260 --> 2:15:32.940
 within a certain feeding window,

2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:36.120
 but that feeding window shifts by a couple hours,

2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:38.660
 it is effectively like jet lagging your system.

2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:43.140
 It is effectively like traveling a couple of time zones over

2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:45.220
 eating there for a few days and coming back

2:15:45.220 --> 2:15:47.800
 when in fact you're not traveling.

2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:50.580
 And that's because of the way that food

2:15:50.580 --> 2:15:52.700
 adjusts the circadian clock genes.

2:15:52.700 --> 2:15:55.520
 Now you can offset some of that through the use of light.

2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:58.040
 And I've talked extensively about how to use light

2:15:58.040 --> 2:16:00.300
 in previous podcasts, but again,

2:16:00.300 --> 2:16:02.620
 early morning and all day bright light exposure

2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:04.500
 as safely as you can, ideally from sunlight,

2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:05.980
 not through a window, et cetera,

2:16:05.980 --> 2:16:07.780
 avoiding bright light in the middle of the night,

2:16:07.780 --> 2:16:10.140
 extremely important for mood,

2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:13.060
 offsetting metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.

2:16:13.060 --> 2:16:17.060
 Not incidentally, Sachin's early work

2:16:17.060 --> 2:16:19.920
 was he was one of the three co-discoverers

2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:21.100
 of the cells in the eye,

2:16:21.100 --> 2:16:22.400
 the so-called melanopsin cells

2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:24.760
 that set the central circadian clock.

2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:26.180
 So he was a pioneer in that field,

2:16:26.180 --> 2:16:28.880
 which led him to be a pioneer in this field and so on.

2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:32.520
 But when should that eight hour window

2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:35.180
 be placed within each 24 hour cycle?

2:16:35.180 --> 2:16:36.760
 Well, let's talk about ideal.

2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:39.440
 Ideal, if you really want to maximize

2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:44.440
 all the health benefits of time restricted feeding,

2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:50.120
 you need to extend the fast around sleep on both sides.

2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:52.680
 You would place it smack dab in the middle of the day.

2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:55.760
 It would be a schedule in which you started eating,

2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:00.760
 for instance, at 10 AM and you stopped eating at 6 PM,

2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.360
 an absolutely dreadful schedule for anyone

2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:06.140
 that wants to have some semblance of a normal life.

2:17:06.140 --> 2:17:07.280
 In my opinion,

2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:09.880
 it's not really compatible with most schedules,

2:17:09.880 --> 2:17:11.760
 although some people might be able to do it.

2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:13.560
 Maybe you and your family or your friends,

2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:17.280
 you're eating a late breakfast

2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:20.120
 and then you're having a late-ish lunch around 2 PM

2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:22.180
 and then you have dinner at six.

2:17:22.180 --> 2:17:26.860
 And then assuming that you go to bed around 9.30 or 10 PM,

2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:30.800
 that is going to extract the maximum amount

2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:33.240
 of weight related, body fat related,

2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:38.660
 metabolic factor related aspects of time restricted feeding.

2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:42.200
 Some people tend to fall into a category

2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:44.880
 where they do best placing that feeding window

2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:48.720
 later in the day and provided it doesn't run

2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:49.660
 too close to your sleep.

2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:51.360
 Remember you need a two or three hour buffer

2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:53.780
 before your sleep, where you're not ingesting anything.

2:17:53.780 --> 2:17:56.360
 That's in order to extract the benefits

2:17:56.360 --> 2:17:57.760
 of time restricted feeding.

2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:01.900
 Well, then starting your feeding window at 12 PM

2:18:01.900 --> 2:18:06.200
 and ending at 8 PM plus or minus half an hour or so,

2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:09.400
 day-to-day seems like a perfectly reasonable schedule

2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:12.440
 for some people starting at 2 PM and ending at 10 PM

2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:13.580
 will be that schedule.

2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:16.600
 Of course, you have to take into consideration

2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:19.840
 when you exercise, if you exercise.

2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:22.080
 For instance, I like to exercise early in the day,

2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:25.580
 if I run or if I do some moderate or light intensity

2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:28.440
 exercise, regardless of what type of exercise it is,

2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:32.280
 I have no trouble waiting until my feeding window kicks in

2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:34.440
 around noon or even 2 PM.

2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:37.200
 But if I do high intensity weight training, for instance,

2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:39.280
 early in the day, or if I run sprints

2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:42.760
 and I do that at 7 AM or 8 AM by 11 AM,

2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:45.580
 I am very, very hungry and it's hard for me

2:18:45.580 --> 2:18:48.460
 to do other things, concentrate, et cetera.

2:18:48.460 --> 2:18:50.740
 Now I'm not neurotic about my feeding window.

2:18:50.740 --> 2:18:51.580
 As I mentioned before,

2:18:51.580 --> 2:18:53.880
 I kind of let it expand and contract a bit

2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:56.480
 around the eight hour mark and feel perfectly free

2:18:56.480 --> 2:18:57.320
 to do that too.

2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:01.800
 We're talking here in ideals, not in necessarily practicals,

2:19:01.800 --> 2:19:05.520
 but other people find that they're very hungry

2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:07.240
 when they wake up early in the day.

2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:09.020
 If you're one of these people or you're somebody

2:19:09.020 --> 2:19:13.040
 who really is trying to emphasize hypertrophy

2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:14.620
 or maintenance of muscle,

2:19:14.620 --> 2:19:17.740
 then it does seem that ingesting protein early in the day

2:19:17.740 --> 2:19:21.880
 is beneficial, that it can be more readily converted

2:19:21.880 --> 2:19:23.640
 into muscle tissue.

2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:26.480
 And this has been demonstrated in at least one study.

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:27.720
 There's another study underway

2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:29.920
 that's exploring this further.

2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:31.640
 For people that are really, really interested

2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:32.980
 in hypertrophy and building muscle,

2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:34.720
 well then time restricted feeding

2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:36.000
 is usually not the way they go.

2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:37.520
 I mean, let's be honest.

2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:39.800
 There are many people out there who are eating

2:19:39.800 --> 2:19:41.320
 four or more meals per day.

2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:44.680
 And they're doing that from 7 AM until 8 PM.

2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:46.360
 I realized that not everybody is overweight.

2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:48.800
 There is an obesity crisis indeed.

2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:50.000
 The percentage of obesity

2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.400
 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

2:19:52.400 --> 2:19:53.760
 is just cosmic through the roof,

2:19:53.760 --> 2:19:56.920
 at least in this country and in other countries as well.

2:19:56.920 --> 2:19:59.600
 This country, me in the US, but other countries as well.

2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:02.320
 But there are of course,

2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:03.960
 people that are trying to gain weight

2:20:03.960 --> 2:20:05.480
 who don't want to lose weight

2:20:05.480 --> 2:20:07.880
 or who are trying to maximize physical performance

2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:09.440
 or hypertrophy or things of that sort.

2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:12.040
 And so of course, time restricted feeding for them

2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:14.680
 might be as long as I'm awake, I'm eating.

2:20:14.680 --> 2:20:18.680
 And I tip my hat to those people and just say,

2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:20.360
 provided you understand what you're doing

2:20:20.360 --> 2:20:21.700
 and the burden that that places

2:20:21.700 --> 2:20:23.600
 on some of the other processes in your body,

2:20:23.600 --> 2:20:27.000
 if that's right for you, then by all means pursue that.

2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:28.880
 Another thing that we can add to this summary

2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:32.100
 or key points related to time restricted feeding

2:20:32.100 --> 2:20:35.780
 is the use of glucose disposal agents and or behaviors.

2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:40.440
 If you find that you've eaten too close to a period of time

2:20:40.440 --> 2:20:42.120
 in which you would prefer to be fasting,

2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:44.400
 that's when a 30 minute brisk walk

2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:49.400
 or even modest walk after eating can be beneficial.

2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:52.000
 Ingesting some lemon juice or lime juice

2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.840
 can help lower blood glucose somewhat.

2:20:54.840 --> 2:20:58.060
 And then there are the things like metformin and berberine.

2:20:58.060 --> 2:20:59.340
 There are even some supplements out there

2:20:59.340 --> 2:21:02.100
 that combine things like berberine, cinnamon,

2:21:02.100 --> 2:21:06.760
 which can lower blood glucose and things like chromium

2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:09.120
 and things that have a mild effect on blood glucose,

2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:14.120
 but berberine and metformin are very high potency,

2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:16.360
 glucose disposal agents.

2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:17.440
 And I mentioned earlier,

2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:18.720
 why you would want to approach those

2:21:18.720 --> 2:21:20.960
 with the appropriate level of caution

2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:22.460
 and figure out the dosages for you.

2:21:22.460 --> 2:21:23.440
 And for some people,

2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:27.040
 the dosages will be zero milligrams is going to be ideal.

2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:29.520
 And then of course we discussed how making sure

2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:30.960
 that you're ingesting enough fluids

2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:33.480
 in particular water and salt,

2:21:33.480 --> 2:21:35.660
 especially if you're using caffeine

2:21:35.660 --> 2:21:38.080
 in order to increase your levels of alertness,

2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:40.500
 regardless of where that caffeine source comes from coffee,

2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:44.380
 tea, or otherwise that can cause the excretion of sodium

2:21:44.380 --> 2:21:45.960
 and can lead to a kind of shakiness,

2:21:45.960 --> 2:21:49.460
 a lightheadedness and the feelings of hunger

2:21:49.460 --> 2:21:52.660
 that may or may not be related to blood glucose.

2:21:53.500 --> 2:21:55.000
 Some people genuinely need to eat.

2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:56.800
 I certainly would not want to see people getting

2:21:56.800 --> 2:21:59.120
 hypoglycemic to the point where it's dangerous.

2:21:59.120 --> 2:22:01.680
 Certainly if you are diabetic,

2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:03.120
 and in fact, for all people,

2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:06.280
 you should consult with your physician

2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:08.640
 when exploring any major changes to diet

2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:10.360
 or additions or subtractions of anything,

2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:11.840
 including supplementation.

2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:13.840
 But for most people,

2:22:13.840 --> 2:22:17.760
 maintaining relatively low to modest blood glucose levels

2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:19.960
 is going to be pretty healthy

2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:21.760
 and will allow all the positive effects

2:22:21.760 --> 2:22:25.200
 of intermittent fasting to occur.

2:22:25.200 --> 2:22:28.680
 And when you find that reaching that start

2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:30.940
 to the feeding window is challenging,

2:22:30.940 --> 2:22:35.840
 that ingesting sodium can often stabilize your system

2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:37.000
 mentally and physically,

2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:40.720
 and allow you to reach that window often painlessly.

2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:43.640
 And then as a final point, as I mentioned earlier,

2:22:43.640 --> 2:22:47.120
 provided that they are consumed in low,

2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:49.540
 no or modest amounts,

2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:53.520
 artificial sweeteners or plant-based non-sugar,

2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:55.800
 non caloric sweeteners,

2:22:55.800 --> 2:22:57.600
 don't seem to really impact blood glucose

2:22:57.600 --> 2:22:59.520
 to the extent that it would quote unquote,

2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:01.520
 take you out of your fast.

2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:03.980
 But that like fat fasting is something

2:23:03.980 --> 2:23:05.760
 that's going to be highly individual

2:23:05.760 --> 2:23:08.240
 and that you're going to have to experiment with

2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:09.360
 for yourself.

2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:12.820
 And being able to recognize when you're in a fast

2:23:12.820 --> 2:23:15.080
 and when you're out of a fast at a subjective level

2:23:15.080 --> 2:23:18.220
 and not constantly having to measure your blood glucose

2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:20.640
 or do things of that sort can be beneficial.

2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:23.760
 And I think if you watch for the feelings associated

2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:26.460
 with eating and post-eating foods of different kinds

2:23:26.460 --> 2:23:27.640
 in different amounts,

2:23:27.640 --> 2:23:31.280
 and you watch for the feelings associated with being fasted

2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:33.840
 for long periods of time or short periods of time

2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:36.460
 of having gotten sufficient sunlight,

2:23:36.460 --> 2:23:38.280
 of having trained hard or not trained hard

2:23:38.280 --> 2:23:40.240
 earlier that day, et cetera,

2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:41.460
 you can do the most important thing,

2:23:41.460 --> 2:23:44.740
 which is to start to learn to evaluate your own system,

2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:47.720
 to run simple, safe experiments on your system

2:23:47.720 --> 2:23:50.320
 in a way that allows you to really establish

2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:52.680
 the ideal nutrition schedule for you,

2:23:52.680 --> 2:23:55.040
 whether it be time restricted feeding,

2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:59.280
 AKA intermittent fasting or some other nutritional plan.

2:23:59.280 --> 2:24:02.340

 if you're not already following Huberman Lab on Instagram,

2:24:27.660 --> 2:24:30.280
 there I do brief posts about science

2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:33.000
 that often are not covered on the podcast.

2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:34.560
 So that's Huberman Lab on Instagram.

2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:36.860
 We're also on Twitter, also at Huberman Lab.

2:24:36.860 --> 2:24:40.080
 Recently, we launched a clips channel, Huberman Lab Clips.

2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:42.720
 Please check out our clips channel and subscribe there

2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:46.000
 for brief excerpts from the various Huberman Lab podcasts.

2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:46.840
 In addition,

2:24:46.840 --> 2:24:48.840
 please check out our sponsors that we mentioned

2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:50.440
 at the beginning of this episode.

2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:52.840
 That's a terrific way to support the podcast.

2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:54.080
 We also have a Patreon,

2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:57.180
 it's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

2:24:57.180 --> 2:24:59.140
 and there you can support the podcast

2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:01.000
 at any level that you like.

2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:04.480
 During this episode and in many other previous episodes,

2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:05.880
 I discussed supplements.

2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:07.140
 One issue with supplements

2:25:07.140 --> 2:25:09.360
 and the supplement industry as a whole

2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:12.520
 is that the quality and amounts of supplements

2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:14.280
 often varies tremendously.

2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:16.980
 Therefore we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:25:16.980 --> 2:25:19.680
 because Thorne has the absolute highest levels of stringency

2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:21.760
 with respect to the quality of ingredients

2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:23.360
 and the amount of the ingredients

2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:25.440
 matching what's on the label.

2:25:25.440 --> 2:25:27.080
 If you want to see what I take

2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:29.880
 and get 20% off any of Thorne's supplements,

2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:34.880
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:25:35.460 --> 2:25:37.080
 You'll see the list of supplements that I take.

2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:38.760
 You can get 20% off those.

2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:41.000
 And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,

2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.500
 you get 20% off anything that Thorne makes.

2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:46.240
 I know we covered a lot of information today.

2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:49.320
 I hope you learned a lot about time-restricted feeding.

2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:52.040
 I hope you learned a lot about metabolism

2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:53.880
 and energy and health

2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:57.700
 and how when you eat is as important as what you eat.

2:25:57.700 --> 2:26:00.040
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:01.800
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:06.800
 And I'll see you in the next one.
