00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.380 --> 00:12.440
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.440 --> 00:15.840
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.640
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.640 --> 00:19.460
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.540
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.540 --> 00:23.680
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.680 --> 00:25.900
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.900 --> 00:27.660
 to the general public.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.860
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.860 --> 00:32.060
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:32.060 --> 00:35.520
 Our first sponsor is Belcampo Meat Company.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.960
 Belcampo Meat Company is a regenerative farm

00:37.960 --> 00:41.140
 in Northern California that raises organic, grass-fed,

00:41.140 --> 00:44.500
 and grass-finished certified humane meats.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.360
 I eat meat about once a day.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.760
 I'm neither pure carnivore nor am I a vegetarian,

00:49.760 --> 00:51.040
 obviously, I eat meat.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.000
 The way I eat is I tend to fast until about noon,

00:55.000 --> 00:56.380
 and then I have my first meal,

00:56.380 --> 00:58.760
 which generally consists of a piece of beef,

00:58.760 --> 01:01.580
 you know, it's either ground beef or a steak.

01:01.580 --> 01:04.400
 I like ribeyes, I like flat irons, these kinds of things,

01:04.400 --> 01:06.940
 and a small salad, sometimes a large salad.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.400
 And then throughout the day,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.620
 I generally am low carb until the evening

01:10.620 --> 01:13.000
 when I eat pasta and rice and things of that sort.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.820
 Eating that way is what optimizes my levels of alertness

01:16.820 --> 01:18.680
 and optimizes my sleep.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.600
 I've talked about this on previous podcast episodes.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.240
 Now, because I eat meat essentially every day,

01:24.240 --> 01:26.480
 the source of that meat is extremely important to me.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.880
 I want it to be healthy for me,

01:27.880 --> 01:31.600
 and I want the animals that it comes from to be healthy

01:31.600 --> 01:33.980
 and to have lived a good life.

01:33.980 --> 01:36.480
 Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots

01:36.480 --> 01:38.840
 and they eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

01:38.840 --> 01:40.040
 which is terrible for them,

01:40.040 --> 01:42.560
 and it's terrible for us when we eat those meats.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.920
 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

01:44.920 --> 01:47.060
 and seasonal grasses, which results in meat

01:47.060 --> 01:49.140
 that is higher in nutrients and healthy fats.

01:49.140 --> 01:51.960
 They actually have very high levels of omega-3s,

01:51.960 --> 01:53.760
 which I've also talked about on this podcast

01:53.760 --> 01:55.800
 are important for mental and physical health

01:55.800 --> 01:57.680
 for a variety of reasons.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.360
 The way Belcampo raises its animals

01:59.360 --> 02:01.920
 is also good for the environment.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.760
 They practice regenerative agriculture,

02:03.760 --> 02:06.920
 which means it's climate positive and carbon negative,

02:06.920 --> 02:10.820
 which translates to good for us and good for the planet.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.060
 You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats

02:13.060 --> 02:16.120
 to be delivered straight to your door using my code Huberman

02:16.120 --> 02:18.960
 by going to belcampo.com slash Huberman,

02:18.960 --> 02:22.200
 and you'll get 20% off your first time order.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.060
 That's belcampo.com slash Huberman for 20% off.

02:27.060 --> 02:30.560
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.240
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

02:33.240 --> 02:35.840
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

02:35.840 --> 02:37.600
 to help you better understand your body

02:37.600 --> 02:39.680
 and reach your health goals.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.600
 I've long been a believer in getting blood work done

02:42.600 --> 02:44.560
 for the simple reason that many,

02:44.560 --> 02:46.880
 if not most of the factors that impact

02:46.880 --> 02:48.720
 our immediate and long-term health

02:48.720 --> 02:51.100
 can only be assessed from a blood test.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.880
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

02:53.880 --> 02:55.440
 we can get additional information

02:55.440 --> 02:58.720
 about our current health status and our health trajectory.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.560
 One of the major problems with blood tests and DNA tests

03:01.560 --> 03:04.880
 available for most sources is that you get the numbers back

03:04.880 --> 03:06.920
 and you can easily see whether or not those numbers

03:06.920 --> 03:09.520
 are within the standard range or outside the range,

03:09.520 --> 03:12.280
 but it's very hard to know what to do with that information.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.440
 Also, what the various factors are that are being measured

03:15.440 --> 03:17.200
 is often very cryptic.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.120
 With Inside Tracker, they clarify everything.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.160
 They make it very clear and simple

03:22.160 --> 03:25.080
 as to what each of those factors relates to.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.520
 So they give you some understanding of what those are

03:27.520 --> 03:30.680
 and they give you ideas and suggestions

03:30.680 --> 03:33.280
 about things that you can do with your lifestyle,

03:33.280 --> 03:36.320
 changes to your diet, changes to your supplementation,

03:36.320 --> 03:39.760
 changes to your sleep schedule or exercise patterns

03:39.760 --> 03:42.280
 that can serve to optimize the levels

03:42.280 --> 03:45.480
 of those various factors and your DNA.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.400
 In addition, they have something called the Inner Age Test,

03:48.400 --> 03:51.000
 which compares your chronological age,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.560
 which you already know, with your biological age,

03:53.560 --> 03:55.680
 which gives you a sense of your lifespan

03:55.680 --> 03:57.120
 or predicted lifespan.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.840
 So that's crucially important.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.080
 And you can imagine why many people, including me,

04:01.080 --> 04:02.800
 would want that information.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.400
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:04.400 --> 04:07.600

04:21.400 --> 04:24.540
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.300
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:26.300 --> 04:29.060
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.380
 I've been using Athletic Greens for well over a decade now.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.960
 I started using Athletic Greens

04:33.960 --> 04:35.440
 and I still use Athletic Greens

04:35.440 --> 04:37.440
 because I find it rather dizzying

04:37.440 --> 04:39.920
 to know which vitamins and minerals to take.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.520
 And with Athletic Greens,

04:41.520 --> 04:44.320
 I cover all my bases of vitamins and minerals.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.160
 In addition, it has probiotics.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.800
 And we now know from an enormous number

04:48.800 --> 04:50.400
 of quality peer-reviewed studies

04:50.400 --> 04:52.760
 that the gut microbiome is critically important

04:52.760 --> 04:54.900
 for our immune system function,

04:54.900 --> 04:57.920
 for the gut brain axis and for our mental functions.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.600
 And probiotics are one way to support the gut brain axis

05:01.600 --> 05:03.800
 and the gut health generally.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.720
 With Athletic Greens, I basically just add water,

05:06.720 --> 05:08.080
 put in a little bit of lemon juice

05:08.080 --> 05:09.400
 because that's the way I like it,

05:09.400 --> 05:10.720
 mix it up, it tastes delicious.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.500
 I'll do that once or twice a day.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.640
 It's compatible with fasting, at least for me.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.360
 It doesn't take me out of a fasting mode,

05:16.360 --> 05:17.760
 which I do early in the day.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.840
 So most often I'll have my Athletic Greens early in the day

05:20.840 --> 05:23.120
 and then sometimes I'll also have another one

05:23.120 --> 05:25.600
 late in the evening or sometimes even before bed.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.740
 I'm able to sleep after drinking it without a problem.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.680
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:30.680 --> 05:33.560
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.280
 And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.200
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

05:38.200 --> 05:40.680
 which are these little packs that make it very easy

05:40.680 --> 05:42.720
 to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road

05:42.720 --> 05:44.560
 or in the car or on a plane,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.120
 makes all of that very simple.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.280
 And in addition, they will give you a year supply

05:48.280 --> 05:50.540
 of vitamin D3K2.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.760
 There are also a lot of data supporting the fact

05:52.760 --> 05:57.400
 that vitamin D3 is critical for a variety of health metrics.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.340
 We all know that we can get vitamin D3 from the sun,

06:00.340 --> 06:02.320
 but many people, including me,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.560
 we're not getting enough sunlight or D3.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.040
 Even if I was getting a lot of sunlight,

06:06.040 --> 06:09.120
 I know that because I had my blood levels measured of D3.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.140
 So I use vitamin D3 every day

06:11.140 --> 06:12.980
 in addition to the other things I take,

06:12.980 --> 06:14.160
 including Athletic Greens.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.080
 If you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

06:17.080 --> 06:19.580
 you'll get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

06:19.580 --> 06:23.320
 and a year supply of the vitamin D3 and K2.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.520
 That's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:25.520 --> 06:27.680
 to claim the special offer.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.640
 This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

06:29.640 --> 06:32.520
 we're talking all about physical performance.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.380
 So that means athletic performance, recreational exercise,

06:36.380 --> 06:40.120
 weightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,

06:40.120 --> 06:42.320
 skills and skill learning.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.200
 Today, we're going to talk about and focus on skill learning.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.700
 We are going to focus on how to learn skills more quickly,

06:49.700 --> 06:51.600
 in particular motor skills.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.280
 This will also translate to things like musical skills

06:55.280 --> 06:56.520
 and playing instruments,

06:56.520 --> 07:00.080
 but we're mainly going to focus on physical movements

07:00.080 --> 07:03.320
 of the body that extend beyond the hands,

07:03.320 --> 07:04.520
 like just playing the piano

07:04.520 --> 07:06.800
 or the fingers like playing the guitar.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.520
 But everything we're going to talk about

07:08.520 --> 07:13.240
 will also serve the formation and the consolidation

07:13.240 --> 07:15.740
 and the performance of other types of skills.

07:15.740 --> 07:19.180
 So if you're interested in how to perform better,

07:19.180 --> 07:21.160
 whether or not it's dance or yoga

07:21.160 --> 07:23.120
 or even something that's just very repetitive

07:23.120 --> 07:27.860
 like running or swimming, this podcast episode is for you.

07:27.860 --> 07:31.480
 We're going to go deep into the science of skill learning

07:31.480 --> 07:34.100
 and we are going to talk about very specific protocols

07:34.100 --> 07:37.240
 that the science points to and has verified

07:37.240 --> 07:39.700
 allow you to learn more quickly,

07:39.700 --> 07:42.520
 to embed that learning so that you remember it

07:42.520 --> 07:45.360
 and to be able to build up skills more quickly

07:45.360 --> 07:47.220
 than you would otherwise.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.100
 We are also going to touch on a few things

07:49.100 --> 07:50.920
 that I get asked about a lot,

07:50.920 --> 07:53.280
 but fortunately recently I've had the time

07:53.280 --> 07:56.320
 to go deep into the literature, extract the data for you

07:56.320 --> 07:58.720
 and that's mental visualization.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.740
 How does visualizing a particular skill or practice

08:02.740 --> 08:05.800
 serve the learning and or the consolidation

08:05.800 --> 08:06.960
 of that practice?

08:06.960 --> 08:10.360
 Turns out there are some absolutely striking protocols

08:10.360 --> 08:12.960
 that one can use, striking meaning they allow you

08:12.960 --> 08:16.160
 to learn faster and they allow you to remember

08:16.160 --> 08:19.320
 how to do things more quickly and better

08:19.320 --> 08:21.320
 than if you were not doing this mental rehearsal,

08:21.320 --> 08:23.580
 but the pattern of mental rehearsal

08:23.580 --> 08:25.640
 and when you do that mental rehearsal

08:25.640 --> 08:27.900
 turns out to be vitally important.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.160
 So I'm excited for today's episode.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.920
 We're going to share a lot of information with you

08:32.920 --> 08:36.200
 and there are going to be a lot of very simple takeaways.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.080
 So let's get started.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.540
 Before we get into the topic of skill learning

08:40.540 --> 08:43.020
 and tools for accelerating skill learning,

08:43.020 --> 08:45.620
 I want to briefly revisit the topic of temperature,

08:45.620 --> 08:47.520
 which was covered in the last episode

08:47.520 --> 08:49.140
 and just highlight a few things

08:49.140 --> 08:51.160
 and clear up some misunderstandings.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.240
 So last episode talked about these incredible data

08:54.240 --> 08:57.320
 from my colleague Craig Heller's lab at Stanford.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.960
 He's in the department of biology

08:58.960 --> 09:02.040
 showing that cooling the palms in particular ways

09:02.040 --> 09:05.080
 and at particular times can allow athletes

09:05.080 --> 09:07.880
 or just recreational exercisers

09:07.880 --> 09:11.160
 to do more pull-ups, dips, bench presses per unit time

09:11.160 --> 09:14.580
 to run further, to cycle further

09:14.580 --> 09:15.940
 and to feel better doing it.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.480
 There really are incredible data

09:17.480 --> 09:21.360
 that are anchored in the biology of the vascular system,

09:21.360 --> 09:25.000
 the blood supply and how it's involved in cooling us.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
 Many of you, dozens of you in fact, said, wait a second,

09:30.600 --> 09:33.600
 you gave us a protocol in this episode

09:33.600 --> 09:36.880
 which says that we should cool our palms periodically

09:36.880 --> 09:40.320
 throughout exercise in order to be able to do more work.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.280
 But on the episode before that

09:43.280 --> 09:46.280
 on growth hormone and thyroid hormone,

09:46.280 --> 09:48.400
 you said that heating up the body

09:48.400 --> 09:51.080
 is good for release of growth hormone.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.800
 And I just want to clarify that both things are true.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.440
 These are two separate protocols.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.600
 You should always warm up before you exercise.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.080
 That warm up will not increase your body temperature

10:02.080 --> 10:04.840
 or the muscle temperature to the point

10:04.840 --> 10:07.520
 where it's going to diminish your work capacity,

10:07.520 --> 10:10.280
 that it's going to harm your performance.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.920
 The cooling of the palms,

10:11.920 --> 10:14.400
 which is really just a route to cool your core

10:14.400 --> 10:17.600
 in an efficient way, the most efficient way in fact,

10:17.600 --> 10:19.560
 is about improving performance.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.800
 Heating up the body with exercise

10:22.800 --> 10:25.020
 and focusing on heat increases

10:25.020 --> 10:28.360
 or using sauna for heat increases

10:28.360 --> 10:30.140
 is geared toward growth hormone release

10:30.140 --> 10:31.680
 which is a separate matter.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.740
 So you can do both of these protocols,

10:33.740 --> 10:36.400
 but you would want to do them at separate times.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.280
 So just to make this very concrete

10:38.280 --> 10:41.040
 before I move on to today's topic,

10:41.040 --> 10:43.840
 if you're interested in doing more work,

10:43.840 --> 10:46.320
 being able to do more sets and reps per unit time

10:46.320 --> 10:48.920
 and feel better doing it or to run further

10:48.920 --> 10:51.040
 or to cycle further,

10:51.040 --> 10:53.200
 then cooling the palms periodically

10:53.200 --> 10:55.340
 as I described in the previous episode

10:55.340 --> 10:56.760
 is going to be the way to go.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.420
 If you're interested in getting growth hormone release,

10:59.420 --> 11:02.700
 well then hot sauna and I offered some other tools

11:02.700 --> 11:03.900
 if you don't have a sauna

11:03.900 --> 11:06.680
 in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid hormone

11:06.680 --> 11:08.280
 is going to be the way to go.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.960
 Okay, so those are separate protocols.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.560
 You can include them in your fitness regime

11:12.560 --> 11:14.080
 and your training regime,

11:14.080 --> 11:16.600
 but you do want to do them at separate times.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.840
 And as a last point about this,

11:18.840 --> 11:20.560
 I also mentioned that caffeine

11:20.560 --> 11:23.160
 can either help or hinder performance

11:23.160 --> 11:25.500
 depending on whether or not you're caffeine adapted

11:25.500 --> 11:28.840
 because of the ways that caffeine impacts body temperature

11:28.840 --> 11:31.560
 and all sorts of things like vasodilation and constriction.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.960
 It's very simple.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.760
 If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts

11:34.760 --> 11:36.500
 and you're accustomed to caffeine,

11:36.500 --> 11:39.760
 meaning you drink it three or five times or more a week,

11:39.760 --> 11:43.640
 100 to 300 milligrams is a typical daily dose of caffeine.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.580
 Some of you are ingesting more, some less.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.040
 If you do that regularly,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.920
 well then it's going to be just fine

11:48.920 --> 11:50.600
 to ingest caffeine before you train.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.440
 It's not going to impact your body temperature

11:52.440 --> 11:54.840
 and your vasodilation or constriction

11:54.840 --> 11:55.880
 in ways that will hinder you.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.520
 However, if you're not a regular caffeine user

11:58.520 --> 12:00.880
 and you're thinking, oh, I'm going to drink a cup of coffee

12:00.880 --> 12:03.400
 and get this huge performance enhancing effect.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.200
 Well, that's not going to happen.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.240
 Chances are it's going to lead to

12:07.240 --> 12:09.160
 increases in body temperature

12:09.160 --> 12:11.400
 and changes in the way that blood flow

12:11.400 --> 12:12.520
 is happening in your body

12:12.520 --> 12:15.660
 and in particular on these palmer surfaces and in your face

12:16.560 --> 12:19.880
 that is going to likely diminish performance.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.000
 So if you enjoy caffeine and you're accustomed to it,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.800
 so-called caffeine adapted, enjoy it before your training.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.080
 If you regularly, excuse me, if you do not

12:29.080 --> 12:30.280
 regularly use caffeine,

12:30.280 --> 12:32.660
 then you probably do not want to view caffeine

12:32.660 --> 12:35.320
 as a performance enhancing tool.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.920
 And while we're on the topic of tools

12:36.920 --> 12:39.720
 and because this is a month on athletic performance

12:39.720 --> 12:44.060
 and exercise and physical skill learning,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.720
 I want to offer an additional tool

12:46.720 --> 12:49.000
 that I've certainly found useful,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.440
 which is how to relieve the so-called side stitch

12:52.440 --> 12:55.880
 or side cramp when running or swimming.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.480
 This actually relates to respiration

12:59.480 --> 13:01.360
 and to the nervous system.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.040
 And it is not a cramp.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.000
 If you've ever been out running

13:05.000 --> 13:07.480
 and you felt like you had a pain on your side,

13:07.480 --> 13:08.880
 that pain could be any number of things,

13:08.880 --> 13:11.400
 but that what feels like cramping of your side

13:11.400 --> 13:14.880
 is actually due to what's called collateralization

13:14.880 --> 13:16.400
 of the phrenic nerve,

13:16.400 --> 13:19.600
 which is a lot harder to say than a side cramp

13:19.600 --> 13:21.000
 or a side stitch.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.080
 But here's the situation.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.480
 You have a set of nerves,

13:25.480 --> 13:29.960
 which is called the phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C,

13:29.960 --> 13:32.680
 the phrenic nerve, which extends down

13:32.680 --> 13:35.620
 from your brainstem essentially, this region,

13:35.620 --> 13:38.660
 to your diaphragm to control your breathing.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.280
 It has a collateral, meaning it has a branch,

13:41.280 --> 13:45.000
 just like the branch on a tree that innervates your liver.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.920
 And if you are not breathing deeply enough,

13:49.920 --> 13:51.600
 what can happen is you can get

13:51.600 --> 13:54.980
 what's called sometimes a referenced pain.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.900
 Reference pain is probably going to be familiar

13:56.900 --> 13:58.560
 to any of you who have ever read

13:58.560 --> 14:00.400
 about how to recognize heart attack.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.560
 People who have heart attacks will sometimes have pain

14:02.560 --> 14:04.840
 on one side of their body, the left arm.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.240
 Sometimes people that have pain in a part of their back

14:07.240 --> 14:09.200
 will suddenly also get pain in their shoulder

14:09.200 --> 14:10.040
 or part of their face.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.080
 This has to do with the fact

14:11.080 --> 14:13.080
 that many of our nerves branch

14:13.080 --> 14:14.920
 and are meaning they're collateralized

14:14.920 --> 14:17.700
 to different organs and areas of the body.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.960
 And the way those nerves are woven together,

14:22.080 --> 14:25.160
 it's often the case that if we disrupt the pattern of firing

14:25.160 --> 14:27.440
 of electrical activity in one of those nerve branches,

14:27.440 --> 14:29.480
 that the other ones are affected too.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.420
 The side stitch, the pain in your side,

14:32.420 --> 14:36.120
 is often because of the contractions of the diaphragm

14:36.120 --> 14:38.700
 because of the way you're breathing while you're exercising,

14:38.700 --> 14:40.360
 running or swimming or biking.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.440
 And as a consequence, you feel pain in your side,

14:43.440 --> 14:45.440
 but that's not a cramp.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.780
 The way to relieve it is very simple.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.480
 You do the physiological side that I've talked about

14:50.480 --> 14:54.040
 in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere,

14:54.040 --> 14:56.820
 which is a double inhale through the nose, very deep,

14:56.820 --> 14:59.040
 and then a long exhale.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.440
 And you might want to repeat that two or three times.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.880
 Typically, that will relieve the side stitch

15:04.880 --> 15:07.720
 because of the way that it changes the firing patterns

15:07.720 --> 15:09.400
 of the phrenic nerve.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.080
 So the side stitch is annoying, it's painful.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.760
 Sometimes when you think we're dehydrated

15:13.760 --> 15:14.960
 and you might be dehydrated,

15:14.960 --> 15:18.240
 but oftentimes it's just that we're breathing in a way

15:18.240 --> 15:21.480
 that causes some referenced pain of the liver.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.200
 We call it a side stitch or a side cramp,

15:24.200 --> 15:25.700
 and you can relieve it very easily

15:25.700 --> 15:27.980
 through the double inhale, long exhale.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.720
 That pattern, done two or three times.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.560
 Often you can continue to engage in the exercise

15:35.560 --> 15:37.840
 while you do the double inhale, exhale,

15:37.840 --> 15:39.980
 and it will just relieve itself that way.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.800
 So give it a try if you experience the side stitch.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.640
 Some people I know are also doing the double inhale,

15:45.640 --> 15:49.840
 long exhale during long continuous bouts of exercise.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.680
 I actually do this when I run.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.040
 We have decent data,

15:53.040 --> 15:54.720
 although these are still unpublished data

15:54.720 --> 15:57.240
 that can engage a kind of regular cadence

15:57.240 --> 15:58.820
 of heart rate variability.

15:58.820 --> 15:59.760
 So there are a number of reasons

15:59.760 --> 16:02.260
 why this physiological side can be useful,

16:02.260 --> 16:05.080
 but it certainly can be useful for relieving the side stitch

16:05.080 --> 16:07.680
 or so-called side cramp.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.440
 Let's talk about the acquisition of new skills.

16:11.440 --> 16:16.440
 These could be skills such as a golf swing or a tennis swing,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.560
 or you're shooting free throws,

16:19.560 --> 16:21.480
 or you're learning to dance,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.720
 or you're learning an instrument.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.480
 I'm mainly going to focus on athletic performance.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.920
 There are basically two types of skills,

16:31.520 --> 16:33.760
 open loop and closed loop.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.300
 Open loop skills are skills

16:37.300 --> 16:39.760
 where you perform some sort of motor action

16:39.760 --> 16:42.520
 and then you wait and you get immediate feedback

16:42.520 --> 16:44.960
 as to whether or not it was done correctly or not.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.000
 A good example will be throwing darts at a dartboard.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.900
 So if you throw the dart,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.240
 you get feedback about whether or not you hit the bull's eye

16:52.240 --> 16:53.720
 and you're off the dartboard

16:53.720 --> 16:56.580
 or you're some other location on the dartboard.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.640
 That's open loop.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.120
 Closed loop would be something that's more continuous.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.720
 So let's say you're a runner

17:02.720 --> 17:06.280
 and you're starting to do some speed work and some sprints

17:06.280 --> 17:08.440
 and you're running and you can kind of feel

17:08.440 --> 17:09.640
 whether or not you're running correctly

17:09.640 --> 17:11.680
 or maybe even have a coach

17:11.680 --> 17:13.900
 and they're correcting your stride

17:13.900 --> 17:16.760
 or you're trying to do some sort of skill

17:16.760 --> 17:18.960
 like a hopscotch skill,

17:18.960 --> 17:22.000
 which maybe you're doing the ladder work

17:22.000 --> 17:24.880
 where you're stepping between designated spaces

17:24.880 --> 17:26.000
 on the ground.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.320
 That's closed loop because as you go,

17:28.320 --> 17:30.300
 you can adjust your behavior

17:30.300 --> 17:33.380
 and you can adjust the distance of your steps

17:33.380 --> 17:35.400
 or you can adjust your speed

17:35.400 --> 17:37.320
 or you can adjust your posture

17:37.320 --> 17:41.120
 and you are able to essentially do more practice

17:41.120 --> 17:42.320
 per unit time,

17:43.240 --> 17:46.240
 but you're getting feedback on a moment to moment basis.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.120
 Okay, so you have open loop and closed loop.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.400
 And just to make this very, very clear,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.880
 open loop would be practicing your tennis serve.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.960
 So let's say that you set a target

17:54.960 --> 17:56.480
 on the other side of the net,

17:56.480 --> 17:59.920
 you throw the ball up and you hit the ball,

17:59.920 --> 18:01.980
 it goes over, that's open loop.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.720
 You'll know whether or not you were in the court,

18:03.720 --> 18:05.600
 you were on the location you wanted to hit

18:05.600 --> 18:07.100
 or close to it or not.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.220
 That's open loop.

18:08.220 --> 18:11.880
 Closed loop would be if you're in a regular case.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.160
 So maybe you're learning a swim stroke

18:14.160 --> 18:16.660
 or maybe you're trying to learn a particular rhythm

18:16.660 --> 18:17.500
 on the drums.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.040
 So maybe you're trying to learn a particular beat.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
 I'm not very musical,

18:20.040 --> 18:21.320
 so I'm not going to embarrass myself

18:21.320 --> 18:22.960
 by giving an example of this,

18:22.960 --> 18:24.760
 although later I will,

18:25.740 --> 18:28.540
 where you're trying to get a particular rhythm down

18:28.540 --> 18:30.640
 and if you're not getting it,

18:30.640 --> 18:32.840
 you can adjust in real time and try and catch up

18:32.840 --> 18:34.760
 or slow down or speed up, et cetera.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.080
 Okay, so hopefully you'll understand open loop

18:37.080 --> 18:38.520
 and closed loop.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.940
 You should always know before you try and learn a skill,

18:40.940 --> 18:43.760
 whether or not it's open loop or closed loop.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.440
 And I'll return to why that's important shortly.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.960
 But if you want to learn something,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.000
 ask is it open loop or closed loop?

18:50.900 --> 18:54.500
 There are essentially three components of any skill

18:54.500 --> 18:56.480
 that involves motor movement.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.520
 And those are sensory perception,

18:59.520 --> 19:01.880
 actually perceiving what you are doing

19:01.880 --> 19:04.140
 and what's happening around you.

19:04.140 --> 19:06.400
 So what you see, what you hear,

19:06.400 --> 19:07.720
 sometimes you're paying attention

19:07.720 --> 19:09.160
 to what you're doing specifically,

19:09.160 --> 19:10.920
 like the trajectory of your arm

19:10.920 --> 19:13.560
 or how you're moving your feet if you're learning to dance.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.080
 Sometimes you're more focused on something

19:15.080 --> 19:16.560
 that's happening outside of you,

19:16.560 --> 19:18.800
 like you're listening for something in music

19:18.800 --> 19:19.720
 or you're paying attention

19:19.720 --> 19:22.200
 to the way your partner is moving, et cetera.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.240
 So there's sensory input.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.480
 Then there are the actual movements, okay?

19:26.480 --> 19:29.320
 So there are the movements of your limbs and body.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.920
 And then there's something called proprioception.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.400
 And proprioception is often discussed

19:35.400 --> 19:40.080
 as kind of a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs are

19:40.080 --> 19:42.100
 in relation to your body.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.120
 So proprioception is vitally important.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.160
 If I reach down and pick up this pen and pick it up,

19:47.160 --> 19:49.980
 I'm not thinking about where the pen in my hand is

19:49.980 --> 19:51.440
 relative to my body,

19:51.440 --> 19:54.980
 but proprioceptively I'm aware of it

19:54.980 --> 19:58.120
 at kind of a sixth cent deeper subconscious level.

19:58.120 --> 20:02.240
 I can also make myself aware of where my limbs are.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.360
 And typically when we learn,

20:04.360 --> 20:08.160
 we are placing more focus on proprioception

20:08.160 --> 20:09.960
 than we do ordinarily.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.560
 So if I get up from this chair

20:11.560 --> 20:13.360
 and I happen to walk out of the room,

20:13.360 --> 20:15.320
 I don't think about where my feet are landing

20:15.320 --> 20:16.800
 relative to one another.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.380
 But if my leg had fallen asleep

20:19.380 --> 20:23.040
 because I had been leaning on one of the nerves of my leg

20:23.040 --> 20:24.360
 or something like that,

20:24.360 --> 20:27.640
 and my leg feels all tingly or numb,

20:27.640 --> 20:29.280
 I and you, if this were to happen,

20:29.280 --> 20:31.880
 you would immediately notice a shift in gait.

20:31.880 --> 20:32.720
 It would feel strange.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.420
 I'd have to pay attention to how I'm stepping.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.260
 And the reason is

20:35.260 --> 20:38.140
 I'm not getting any proprioceptive feedback.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.840
 Now, skill learning has a lot of other dimensions too,

20:41.760 --> 20:44.380
 but those are the main ones that we're going to focus on.

20:44.380 --> 20:45.600
 So just to remind you,

20:45.600 --> 20:47.440
 you need to know open loop or closed loop,

20:47.440 --> 20:49.840
 and you need to know whether or not, excuse me,

20:49.840 --> 20:52.480
 you need to know that there's sensory perception,

20:52.480 --> 20:54.300
 what you're paying attention to,

20:55.280 --> 20:58.480
 movements themselves and proprioception.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.380
 And there's one other important thing that you need to know,

21:02.380 --> 21:04.660
 which is that movement of any kind

21:04.660 --> 21:08.440
 is generated from one, two, or three sources

21:08.440 --> 21:11.860
 within your nervous system, within your brain and body.

21:11.860 --> 21:15.480
 These are central pattern generators,

21:15.480 --> 21:17.840
 which are sometimes called CSPGs.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.240
 Excuse me, CPGSs.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.160
 CSPGs are something entirely different in biology.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.960
 CPGSs, this just goes to show that I have a module.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.200
 CSPGs are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.800
 They have nothing to do with this topic.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.840
 CPGSs are central pattern generators,

21:35.840 --> 21:38.320
 or CPGs they're sometimes called.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.760
 These CPGs are in your spinal cord,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.440
 mine and yours, different ones,

21:44.440 --> 21:46.960
 and they generate repetitive movements.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.400
 So if you're walking, if you're running,

21:49.400 --> 21:52.200
 if you're cycling, if you're breathing,

21:52.200 --> 21:53.300
 which presumably you are,

21:53.300 --> 21:56.640
 and you're doing that in a regular rhythmic cadence,

21:56.640 --> 21:59.760
 central pattern generators are controlling that movement.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.500
 After you learn how to walk, run, swim, cycle,

22:03.500 --> 22:07.200
 do anything really, much of the work is handed off

22:07.200 --> 22:09.600
 to the central pattern generators.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.480
 And there were experiments that were done

22:12.480 --> 22:14.780
 in the 60s, 70s, and 80s

22:14.780 --> 22:18.240
 that actually looked at the cerebrate animals

22:18.240 --> 22:20.820
 and even the cerebrate humans.

22:20.820 --> 22:24.600
 These are humans and animals that lack a cerebral cortex.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.120
 They lack much of the brain,

22:27.120 --> 22:30.620
 and yet they can engage in what's called a fictive movement.

22:30.620 --> 22:32.700
 So it sounds like a kind of barbaric experiment.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.560
 I'm glad I wasn't the one to have to do them,

22:34.560 --> 22:36.580
 but this is the stuff of neuroscience textbooks

22:36.580 --> 22:39.820
 that cats or dogs or mice

22:39.820 --> 22:42.340
 that have their neocortex removed,

22:42.340 --> 22:44.520
 put them on a treadmill, they'll walk just fine.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.780
 And they will adjust their speed of walking just fine,

22:47.780 --> 22:49.200
 even though they basically lack

22:49.200 --> 22:51.720
 all their thinking decision-making brain.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.920
 And it turns out humans that have,

22:53.920 --> 22:56.700
 unfortunately, massive strokes to their cortex

22:56.700 --> 22:59.320
 and lack any neocortex,

22:59.320 --> 23:02.080
 but preserve the central pattern generators,

23:02.080 --> 23:04.520
 will also walk just fine,

23:04.520 --> 23:07.860
 even though they lack any of the other stuff in the brain.

23:07.860 --> 23:12.240
 So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing,

23:12.240 --> 23:15.960
 and they control a lot of our already learned behavior.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.920
 When you're really good at something,

23:17.920 --> 23:22.040
 CPGs are controlling a lot of that behavior.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.720
 And that's true also for a golf swing,

23:24.720 --> 23:26.640
 even if it's not really repetitive.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.800
 Somebody who's really good at golf is going to,

23:28.800 --> 23:30.520
 I guess you call it a tee.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.520
 You put the ball on the tee.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.720
 I show my knowledge of golf.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.360
 I've only done mini golf, frankly,

23:35.960 --> 23:37.720
 but someday maybe I'll learn how to golf,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.440
 but you set the golf ball down and swing.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.880
 Set the golf ball down, swing.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.840
 Central pattern generators are going to handle a lot of that.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.520
 If I were to go to the golf course,

23:47.520 --> 23:48.960
 Stanford has a beautiful golf course,

23:48.960 --> 23:50.840
 if I were to go out there and put a ball on the tee,

23:50.840 --> 23:52.080
 my central pattern generators

23:52.080 --> 23:54.240
 would not be involved in that at all.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.400
 The moment I get, you know, bring the club back to swing,

23:58.400 --> 24:00.820
 it's going to engage other things.

24:00.820 --> 24:02.640
 And the other things it's going to engage,

24:02.640 --> 24:06.140
 because I don't know that behavior now or then,

24:06.140 --> 24:08.480
 is upper motor neurons.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.520
 We have motor neurons in our cortex,

24:11.520 --> 24:15.320
 in our neocortex that control deliberate action.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.480
 And those are the ones that you're engaging

24:17.480 --> 24:19.160
 when you are learning.

24:19.160 --> 24:23.360
 Those are the ones that you have to pay attention

24:23.360 --> 24:25.080
 in order to engage.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.320
 And that's what's happening, for instance,

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
 if I decide I'm going to reach down and pick up my pen,

24:28.320 --> 24:29.560
 which I rarely think about,

24:29.560 --> 24:30.400
 but now I'm thinking about it

24:30.400 --> 24:31.960
 and I'm going to do this in a very deliberate way,

24:31.960 --> 24:33.680
 I'm going to grab with these two fingers and lift,

24:33.680 --> 24:36.620
 my upper motor neurons are now involved, okay?

24:36.620 --> 24:39.300
 So upper motor neurons are very important

24:39.300 --> 24:41.440
 because a little bit later in the episode,

24:41.440 --> 24:44.360
 when we talk about how to use visualization

24:44.360 --> 24:47.000
 in order to accelerate skill learning,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.480
 it's going to leverage these upper motor neurons

24:50.480 --> 24:52.080
 in very particular ways, okay?

24:52.080 --> 24:53.740
 So we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,

24:53.740 --> 24:56.820
 upper motor neurons for deliberate unlearned movements

24:56.820 --> 24:59.720
 or movements that we are in the process of learning.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.440
 And then we have what are called lower motor neurons.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.960
 Lower motor neurons are the ones in our spinal cord

25:04.960 --> 25:06.800
 that send little wires out to our muscles,

25:06.800 --> 25:10.880
 which actually cause the firing of those muscle fibers, okay?

25:10.880 --> 25:12.440
 So the way to think about this

25:12.440 --> 25:13.800
 is you've got upper motor neurons,

25:13.800 --> 25:16.600
 which talk to CPGs and to lower motor neurons.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.060
 So it's really simple.

25:18.060 --> 25:21.320
 And now you know most everything there is to know

25:21.320 --> 25:24.280
 about the neural pathways controlling movement,

25:24.280 --> 25:26.400
 at least for sake of this discussion.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.200
 So anytime we learn something,

25:28.200 --> 25:32.900
 we have to decide what to place our sensory perception on,

25:32.900 --> 25:35.320
 meaning what are we going to focus on?

25:35.320 --> 25:36.160
 That's critical.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.000
 If you're listening to this

25:37.000 --> 25:39.400
 and you're the type of person who likes taking notes,

25:39.400 --> 25:41.640
 this should be the second question you ask.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.920
 Remember the first question is,

25:42.920 --> 25:45.000
 is it open loop or closed loop?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.780
 The second question should be,

25:47.760 --> 25:50.160
 what should I focus my attention on?

25:50.160 --> 25:54.220
 Auditory attention, visual attention, or proprioception.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.340
 Should I focus on where my limbs are relative to my body

25:57.340 --> 25:59.760
 or should I focus on the outcome?

25:59.760 --> 26:01.600
 Okay, this is a critical distinction.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.980
 You can decide to learn how to do a golf swing

26:03.980 --> 26:05.640
 or learn how to shoot free throws

26:05.640 --> 26:07.080
 or learn how to dance tango

26:07.080 --> 26:09.120
 and decide that you are going to focus

26:09.120 --> 26:12.760
 on the movements of your partner

26:12.760 --> 26:14.640
 or the positions of your feet.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.120
 Maybe you're going to look at them.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.900
 Maybe you're going to sense them.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.960
 You're going to actually feel where they are.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.560
 Or maybe you're going to sense

26:22.560 --> 26:24.360
 the position and posture of your body,

26:24.360 --> 26:26.120
 which is more proprioceptive, okay?

26:26.120 --> 26:28.180
 So you have to allocate your attention.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.940
 And I'm going to tell you how to allocate your attention best

26:30.940 --> 26:32.460
 in order to learn faster.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.720
 So these are the sorts of decisions that you have to make.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.840
 Fortunately for you, you don't have to think about

26:37.840 --> 26:40.480
 whether or not you're going to use your upper motor neurons

26:40.480 --> 26:42.500
 and your lower motor neurons or not,

26:42.500 --> 26:43.920
 because if you don't know how to do something,

26:43.920 --> 26:45.460
 you're automatically going to engage

26:45.460 --> 26:46.360
 your upper motor neurons.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.500
 And if you do, you are all right,

26:49.500 --> 26:51.280
 then you're not going to use your upper motor neurons.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.800
 You're mainly going to rely on central pattern generators.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.940
 You are always using your lower motor neurons

26:56.940 --> 26:58.100
 to move muscle.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.760
 So we can really simplify things now.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.240
 I've given you a lot of information, but we can simplify it.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.360
 Basically open loop or closed loop, that's one question.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.120
 And what am I going to focus on?

27:07.120 --> 27:09.800
 And then your neurology will take care of the rest.

27:09.800 --> 27:13.680
 So now I want to talk about realistic expectations.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.440
 Somewhere in Hollywood, presumably,

27:18.440 --> 27:20.880
 it got embedded in somebody's mind

27:20.880 --> 27:24.400
 that instant skill acquisition was possible,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.460
 that you could take a particular pill

27:26.460 --> 27:29.100
 or you could touch a particular object,

27:29.100 --> 27:31.820
 or you could have a wand wave over you

27:31.820 --> 27:34.620
 and you would suddenly have a skill.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.660
 And so that is the result of Hollywood at all.

27:38.660 --> 27:43.660
 It doesn't exist, at least not in reality.

27:43.660 --> 27:47.000
 And I love movies, but it simply doesn't exist.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.620
 Then the self-help literature created another rule

27:51.620 --> 27:54.260
 called the 10,000 hours rule.

27:54.260 --> 27:57.900
 And frankly, that doesn't really match the literature,

27:57.900 --> 27:59.940
 at least the scientific literature either.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.860
 I like it because it implies that learning takes time,

28:04.860 --> 28:08.580
 which is more accurate than the Hollywood at all

28:08.580 --> 28:11.960
 instant skill acquisition rule,

28:11.960 --> 28:14.660
 which isn't really a rule, it's a myth.

28:14.660 --> 28:18.460
 But the 10,000 hours rule overlooks something crucial,

28:18.460 --> 28:23.460
 which is that it's not about hours, it's about repetitions.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.520
 Now, of course, there's a relationship

28:26.520 --> 28:29.440
 between time and repetitions,

28:29.440 --> 28:31.820
 but there are some beautiful experiments

28:31.820 --> 28:36.820
 that point to the fact that by simple adjustment

28:36.820 --> 28:39.540
 of what you are focused on

28:39.540 --> 28:42.380
 as you attempt to learn a new skill,

28:42.380 --> 28:45.660
 you can adjust the number of repetitions that you do,

28:45.660 --> 28:47.800
 you adjust your motivation for learning,

28:47.800 --> 28:50.340
 and you can vastly accelerate learning.

28:51.620 --> 28:55.220
 Some of you may recognize this by its internet name,

28:55.220 --> 28:56.920
 which is not a scientific term,

28:56.920 --> 28:59.180
 which is the Super Mario effect.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.020
 There's actually a quite good video on YouTube

29:02.020 --> 29:03.720
 describing the Super Mario effect.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.580
 I think it was a YouTuber who has,

29:05.580 --> 29:08.060
 I think, a background in science.

29:08.060 --> 29:11.020
 And he did an interesting experiment,

29:11.020 --> 29:13.740
 and I'll talk about his experiment first,

29:13.740 --> 29:16.700
 and then I will talk about the neurobiology

29:16.700 --> 29:20.180
 that supports the result that he got.

29:20.180 --> 29:22.600
 The Super Mario effect relates

29:22.600 --> 29:24.140
 to the game Super Mario Brothers,

29:24.140 --> 29:26.120
 but you'll see why at the end.

29:26.120 --> 29:30.780
 But basically what they did was they had 50,000 subjects,

29:30.780 --> 29:34.140
 which is a enormous number of subjects.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.320
 Learn a program,

29:36.320 --> 29:39.200
 essentially taking words from a computer program

29:39.200 --> 29:41.700
 or the commands for a computer program

29:41.700 --> 29:44.980
 that were kind of clustered in a column on the right.

29:44.980 --> 29:46.320
 So these are the sorts of things

29:46.320 --> 29:48.540
 that computer programmers will be familiar with,

29:48.540 --> 29:49.700
 but other people won't.

29:50.740 --> 29:53.080
 And those commands are essentially,

29:53.080 --> 29:56.380
 they essentially translate to things like go forward,

29:56.380 --> 29:58.500
 and then if it's a right-hand turn in the maze,

29:58.500 --> 30:00.700
 then go right and continue

30:00.700 --> 30:02.760
 until you hit a choice point, et cetera.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.420
 So it's a bunch of instructions,

30:04.420 --> 30:06.860
 but the job of the subjects in these experiments

30:06.860 --> 30:09.160
 were to organize those instructions in a particular way

30:09.160 --> 30:11.240
 that would allow a little cursor

30:11.240 --> 30:13.700
 to move through the maze successfully, okay?

30:13.700 --> 30:15.340
 So basically the goal was,

30:15.340 --> 30:17.160
 or at least what the subjects were told,

30:17.160 --> 30:20.100
 is that anyone can learn to computer program,

30:20.100 --> 30:23.820
 and if somebody can just organize the instructions

30:23.820 --> 30:24.840
 in the right way,

30:24.840 --> 30:27.740
 then they can program this little cursor

30:27.740 --> 30:29.540
 to move through a maze, very simple.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.760
 And yet, if you don't have any background

30:32.760 --> 30:34.780
 in computer programming, or even if you do,

30:34.780 --> 30:36.060
 it takes some skill.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.700
 You have to know what commands to give

30:37.700 --> 30:39.780
 in what particular order, and they made that very easy.

30:39.780 --> 30:41.660
 You could just assemble them in a list

30:41.660 --> 30:42.760
 over onto the right.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.700
 So people started doing this.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.380
 Now, there were two groups,

30:48.380 --> 30:51.640
 and one half of the subjects,

30:51.640 --> 30:53.700
 if they got it wrong,

30:54.620 --> 30:57.180
 meaning they entered a command and the cursor would move,

30:57.180 --> 31:00.920
 and it was the wrong command

31:00.920 --> 31:03.980
 for this little cursor to move through the maze,

31:03.980 --> 31:07.100
 they saw a signal jump up on their screen

31:07.100 --> 31:11.740
 that said, that did not work, please try again.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.420
 That's it.

31:13.420 --> 31:14.640
 If they put in the wrong command

31:14.640 --> 31:15.580
 or it was in the wrong sequence,

31:15.580 --> 31:17.140
 it would say, that did not work, please try again,

31:17.140 --> 31:20.360
 and then the subjects would reorganize the instructions,

31:20.360 --> 31:21.780
 and then the little cursor would continue,

31:21.780 --> 31:23.560
 and if they got it wrong again,

31:23.560 --> 31:26.200
 it would say, that did not work, please try again, okay?

31:26.200 --> 31:28.740
 The other half of the subjects,

31:28.740 --> 31:31.000
 if they got something wrong, were told,

31:32.240 --> 31:36.040
 you just lost five points, please continue.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.900
 So that's the only difference in the feedback that they got.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.740
 Now, I have to confess, I would have predicted

31:43.740 --> 31:46.980
 based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry

31:46.980 --> 31:51.980
 and reward contingency and epinephrine and stress

31:52.140 --> 31:53.380
 and motivated learning,

31:53.380 --> 31:55.700
 and this other thing that we've been told

31:55.700 --> 31:58.820
 in many, many books on behavioral economics

31:58.820 --> 32:00.120
 and in the self-help literature,

32:00.120 --> 32:02.740
 which is that people will work much harder

32:02.740 --> 32:05.080
 to prevent losing something

32:05.080 --> 32:07.600
 than they will to gain something,

32:07.600 --> 32:09.360
 that you hear all the time,

32:09.360 --> 32:13.060
 and it turns out that that's not at all what happened.

32:13.060 --> 32:17.700
 If they looked at the success rate of the subjects,

32:17.700 --> 32:20.900
 what they found was that the subjects that were told,

32:20.900 --> 32:23.740
 that did not work, please try again,

32:23.740 --> 32:25.920
 had a 68% success rate.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.780
 68% of them went on to successfully program

32:29.780 --> 32:31.960
 this cursor moving through the maze.

32:31.960 --> 32:35.500
 Whereas the ones that were told, you lost five points,

32:35.500 --> 32:40.460
 had a 52% success rate, which is a significant difference.

32:40.460 --> 32:45.100
 But the source of the success or the lack of success

32:45.100 --> 32:47.020
 is really interesting.

32:47.020 --> 32:49.740
 The subjects that were told, that did not work,

32:49.740 --> 32:50.900
 please try again,

32:50.900 --> 32:55.900
 tried many, many more times per unit time.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.680
 In other words, they made more attempts

32:57.680 --> 32:58.880
 at programming this thing

32:58.880 --> 33:01.300
 to allow this cursor to move through the maze.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.940
 Whereas the people that were told, you lost five points,

33:03.940 --> 33:07.140
 gave up earlier or gave up entirely.

33:07.140 --> 33:09.380
 Okay, so let's just step back from this

33:09.380 --> 33:12.140
 because to me, this was very surprising.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.220
 It violates a lot of things that I had heard

33:14.220 --> 33:18.040
 in the kind of popular culture or the self-help literature

33:18.040 --> 33:19.660
 that people will work much harder

33:19.660 --> 33:22.560
 to avoid losing something than they will to gain something.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.380
 And it didn't really fit with what I understood

33:25.380 --> 33:27.440
 about reward contingencies and dopamine.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.520
 But it did fit well with another set of experiments

33:31.520 --> 33:34.620
 that I'm very familiar with from the neuroscience literature

33:34.620 --> 33:36.300
 and I'll give you the punchline first.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.460
 And then we're going to take what these data mean

33:38.460 --> 33:41.340
 and we're going to talk about a learning protocol

33:41.340 --> 33:45.060
 that you can use that will allow you to learn skills faster

33:45.060 --> 33:49.460
 by willingly participating in more repetitions

33:49.460 --> 33:50.480
 of the skill learning.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.280
 Meaning you will want to do more repetitions

33:53.280 --> 33:56.920
 even if you're getting it wrong some or most of the time.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.320
 So the experiment that I want to tell you about

34:00.320 --> 34:01.820
 is called the tube test.

34:01.820 --> 34:03.940
 And this is generally done in mice

34:03.940 --> 34:05.500
 although it's sometimes been done in rats

34:05.500 --> 34:07.460
 and it has a lot of parallels to some things

34:07.460 --> 34:11.460
 that you've probably seen and experienced

34:11.460 --> 34:16.200
 even in human life, in regular life, maybe even in your life.

34:16.200 --> 34:17.980
 So here's the experiment.

34:17.980 --> 34:20.260
 You take two rats, you put them in a tube

34:20.260 --> 34:22.120
 or two mice, you put them in a tube.

34:22.120 --> 34:25.780
 And mice and rats, they don't like to share the same tube.

34:25.780 --> 34:28.500
 So what they'll do is they'll start pushing each other

34:28.500 --> 34:30.540
 back and forth, back and forth.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.700
 Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice

34:32.700 --> 34:34.780
 pushes the other one out.

34:34.780 --> 34:36.340
 The one that got pushed out is the loser.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.980
 The one that gets the tube is the winner.

34:38.980 --> 34:43.980
 Okay, now you take the winner, you give it a new competitor

34:43.980 --> 34:48.020
 and what you find is that the mouse or rat

34:48.020 --> 34:52.900
 that won previously has a much higher than chance

34:52.900 --> 34:55.700
 probability of winning the second time.

34:55.700 --> 35:00.580
 In other words, winning before leads to winning again.

35:00.580 --> 35:01.900
 And the reverse is also true.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.820
 If you take the loser and you put that loser in

35:04.820 --> 35:07.980
 with another mouse, fresh mouse, new mouse,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.660
 the loser typically will lose

35:10.660 --> 35:13.120
 at much greater probability than chance.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.780
 And this is not related to differences in strength

35:15.780 --> 35:18.640
 or size or testosterone or any other of the things

35:18.640 --> 35:21.100
 that might leap to mind as explanations for this

35:21.100 --> 35:23.460
 because those were all controlled for.

35:23.460 --> 35:27.600
 Now, that result had been known about for decades

35:27.600 --> 35:30.520
 but three years ago, there was a paper published

35:30.520 --> 35:32.540
 in the journal Science, Phenomenal Journal,

35:32.540 --> 35:35.040
 it's one of the three apex journals,

35:35.040 --> 35:37.500
 that examined the brain area that's involved in this.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.400
 Turns out it's a particular area of the frontal cortex

35:40.400 --> 35:41.740
 for those of you that want to know.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.020
 And they did a simple experiment where they,

35:44.020 --> 35:47.500
 the experimenters increased or decreased the activity

35:47.500 --> 35:49.540
 of this brain area in the prefrontal cortex,

35:49.540 --> 35:51.100
 little sub-region of the prefrontal cortex.

35:51.100 --> 35:54.340
 And what they found is if they stimulated this brain area,

35:55.220 --> 35:58.060
 a mouse or rat, regardless of whether or not

35:58.060 --> 36:00.100
 it had been a winner or loser before,

36:00.100 --> 36:02.360
 became a winner every single time.

36:03.380 --> 36:06.720
 And they showed that if they blocked the activity

36:06.720 --> 36:09.700
 of this brain area, regardless of whether or not

36:09.700 --> 36:11.740
 the mouse or rat had been a winner or a loser,

36:11.740 --> 36:13.900
 it became a loser every single time.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.620
 And this translated to other scenarios,

36:16.620 --> 36:18.980
 other competitive scenarios,

36:18.980 --> 36:20.860
 where they'd put a bunch of mice or rats

36:20.860 --> 36:23.460
 in a kind of cool chamber,

36:23.460 --> 36:25.060
 they'd have a little heat lamp in the corner

36:25.060 --> 36:26.100
 and mice like heat,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.340
 and there was only enough space for one mouse

36:28.340 --> 36:30.300
 to get the, be under the heat.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.340
 And the one that had won in the tube test

36:32.340 --> 36:33.900
 or that had the brain area stimulated

36:33.900 --> 36:36.940
 always got the nice warm spot, okay?

36:36.940 --> 36:39.260
 So what is this magic brain area?

36:39.260 --> 36:40.400
 What is it doing?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.360
 Well, the reason I'm bringing this up today,

36:42.360 --> 36:43.740
 and the reason I'm bringing it up

36:43.740 --> 36:45.820
 on the heels of the Super Mario effect

36:45.820 --> 36:48.900
 is that stimulation of this brain area

36:48.900 --> 36:52.940
 had a very simple and very important effect,

36:52.940 --> 36:55.620
 which was it led to more forward steps,

36:55.620 --> 36:59.220
 more repetitions, more effort,

36:59.220 --> 37:01.500
 but not in terms of sheer might and will,

37:01.500 --> 37:05.740
 not digging deeper, just more repetitions per unit time.

37:05.740 --> 37:09.780
 And the losers had fewer repetitions per unit time.

37:09.780 --> 37:13.380
 So the Super Mario effect, this online experiment,

37:13.380 --> 37:16.180
 and the tube test, which has been done by various labs

37:16.180 --> 37:17.820
 and repeated again and again,

37:17.820 --> 37:21.180
 point to a simple but very important rule,

37:21.180 --> 37:23.540
 which is neither the 10,000 hours rule

37:23.540 --> 37:26.860
 nor the magic wand Hollywood version of learning,

37:26.860 --> 37:29.460
 but rather the neurobiological explanation

37:29.460 --> 37:33.260
 for learning a skill is you want to perform

37:33.260 --> 37:37.520
 as many repetitions per unit time as you possibly can,

37:38.760 --> 37:41.780
 at least when you're first trying to learn a skill.

37:41.780 --> 37:42.620
 I want to repeat that.

37:42.620 --> 37:46.640
 You want to perform as many repetitions as you possibly can,

37:46.640 --> 37:49.400
 at least when you're first trying to learn a skill.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.620
 Now that might sound like a duh, it's just more reps,

37:53.620 --> 37:56.060
 but it's not so obvious.

37:56.060 --> 37:58.360
 There's no reason why more repetitions

37:58.360 --> 38:00.780
 should necessarily lead to faster learning

38:00.780 --> 38:03.900
 because you could also say, well, more repetitions,

38:03.900 --> 38:05.120
 you can make more errors,

38:05.120 --> 38:07.600
 and those errors would lead to poor performance,

38:07.600 --> 38:09.880
 like misstepping a number of times.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.540
 And in these cases, there's very little feedback, right?

38:13.540 --> 38:17.740
 It's not like every time the rat pushes forward

38:17.740 --> 38:20.620
 or moves back that it is sensing, oh, I'm winning,

38:20.620 --> 38:22.660
 I'm losing, I'm winning, I'm losing on a micro level.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.860
 It probably does that as it starts to push the other one out

38:24.860 --> 38:26.700
 the rat or mouse probably thinks I'm winning.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.500
 And as it's backing up, it probably thinks I'm losing.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.880
 As you play the game, the Super Mario game,

38:32.800 --> 38:35.040
 you are told, nope, that didn't work,

38:35.040 --> 38:37.100
 nope, that didn't work, please try again.

38:38.840 --> 38:42.500
 But the important thing is that the winners

38:42.500 --> 38:46.460
 are always generating more repetitions per unit time.

38:46.460 --> 38:49.740
 It's just a repeat of performance, repeat of performance,

38:49.740 --> 38:51.120
 even if there are errors.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.020
 And that points to something vitally important,

38:54.020 --> 38:57.900
 which is reps are important,

38:57.900 --> 39:01.260
 but making error reps is also important.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.980
 In fact, it might be the most important factor.

39:03.980 --> 39:08.020
 So let's talk about errors and why those solve the problem

39:08.020 --> 39:09.900
 of what to focus on.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.740
 Because as I said earlier, if you want to learn something,

39:12.740 --> 39:15.280
 you need to know if it's open loop or closed loop,

39:15.280 --> 39:17.340
 and you need to know what to focus on,

39:17.340 --> 39:18.940
 where to place your perception.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.100
 And that seems like a tough task,

39:21.100 --> 39:24.540
 but errors will tell you exactly what to focus on.

39:24.540 --> 39:27.620
 So let's talk about errors and why you can leverage errors

39:27.620 --> 39:29.600
 to accelerate skill learning.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.600
 Okay, so we've established that performing

39:31.600 --> 39:35.620
 the maximum number of repetitions per training session

39:35.620 --> 39:37.620
 is going to be advantageous.

39:37.620 --> 39:39.360
 And that might seem obvious,

39:39.360 --> 39:43.320
 but there's a shadowy side to that, which is,

39:43.320 --> 39:46.000
 well, why would I want to just repeat the same thing

39:46.000 --> 39:49.460
 over and over again if I'm getting it wrong 90% of the time?

39:49.460 --> 39:51.260
 And the reason is that the errors

39:51.260 --> 39:55.140
 actually cue your nervous system to two things,

39:55.140 --> 39:58.340
 one, to error correction,

39:58.340 --> 40:00.780
 and the other is it opens the door

40:00.780 --> 40:02.900
 or the window for neuroplasticity.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.220
 Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's ability

40:06.220 --> 40:08.580
 to change in response to experience,

40:08.580 --> 40:11.420
 essentially to custom modify itself

40:11.420 --> 40:13.900
 in order to perform anything better.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.900
 We did an entire month on neuroplasticity,

40:15.900 --> 40:17.640
 and I talked a little bit about errors

40:17.640 --> 40:19.060
 and why they're important.

40:19.060 --> 40:21.360
 Now we're going to make this very concrete

40:21.360 --> 40:24.600
 and operationalize it, make it very actionable.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.860
 There was a paper that was published in 2021

40:27.860 --> 40:29.580
 from Norman et al.

40:29.580 --> 40:32.020
 This is a very important paper.

40:32.020 --> 40:33.500
 It was published in the journal Neuron,

40:33.500 --> 40:36.520
 which is a cell press journal, excellent journal.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.380
 The title of the paper gives it away essentially,

40:39.380 --> 40:41.460
 which is Post-Error Recruitment

40:41.460 --> 40:45.500
 of Frontal Sensory Cortical Projections Promotes Attention.

40:45.500 --> 40:50.500
 Now, what that says is that when you make an error,

40:50.500 --> 40:54.620
 it causes an activation of the brain areas

40:54.620 --> 40:56.700
 that anchor your attention.

40:56.700 --> 40:59.940
 Remember, we need perception, attention,

40:59.940 --> 41:01.240
 which they're essentially the same thing.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.340
 We need proprioception,

41:02.340 --> 41:04.300
 and we need the upper and lower motor neurons

41:04.300 --> 41:06.740
 to communicate in the proper ways.

41:06.740 --> 41:09.820
 And this vital question is what to pay attention to.

41:09.820 --> 41:12.060
 Errors tell your nervous system

41:12.060 --> 41:13.940
 that something needs to change.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.980
 So if you are performing a task or a skill,

41:16.980 --> 41:18.160
 like you're learning how to dance

41:18.160 --> 41:19.820
 and you're stepping on the other person's toes

41:19.820 --> 41:22.260
 or you're fumbling or you're not getting it right,

41:22.260 --> 41:25.340
 those errors are opening the possibility for plasticity.

41:25.340 --> 41:27.580
 If you walk away at that point,

41:27.580 --> 41:30.700
 you've made the exact wrong choice, okay?

41:30.700 --> 41:33.300
 Unless the errors are somehow hazardous to your health

41:33.300 --> 41:35.540
 or somebody else's wellbeing,

41:35.540 --> 41:39.260
 you want to continue to engage at a high repetition rate.

41:39.260 --> 41:41.700
 That's really where the learning is possible.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.700
 Without errors, the brain is not in a position

41:45.700 --> 41:47.180
 to change itself.

41:47.180 --> 41:51.180
 Errors actually cue the frontal cortex networks,

41:51.180 --> 41:52.940
 what we call top-down processing,

41:52.940 --> 41:54.460
 and the neuromodulators,

41:54.460 --> 41:57.140
 things like dopamine and acetylcholine and epinephrine,

41:57.140 --> 41:59.980
 that will allow for plasticity.

41:59.980 --> 42:02.660
 So while the Super Mario experiment, the maze experiment,

42:02.660 --> 42:05.120
 was only focused on generating errors,

42:05.120 --> 42:07.020
 telling people that wasn't right, please try again,

42:07.020 --> 42:09.780
 or that wasn't right, you lost five points,

42:09.780 --> 42:13.740
 the key distinction is that the errors themselves

42:13.740 --> 42:17.140
 cued people to the fact that they needed to change something.

42:17.140 --> 42:19.220
 So if you're trying to learn a new skill

42:19.220 --> 42:22.440
 and you're screwing up and you're making mistakes,

42:22.440 --> 42:23.900
 the more mistakes you make,

42:23.900 --> 42:26.380
 the more plastic your brain becomes,

42:26.380 --> 42:28.800
 such that when you get it right,

42:28.800 --> 42:33.460
 that correct pattern will be rewarded and consolidated.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.340
 And you can trust that it will

42:35.340 --> 42:37.820
 because the performance of something correctly

42:37.820 --> 42:39.660
 is associated with the release

42:39.660 --> 42:41.560
 of this neuromodulator dopamine.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.580
 Dopamine is involved in craving and motivation,

42:44.580 --> 42:45.780
 it's involved in a lot of things,

42:45.780 --> 42:47.980
 but it's also involved in learning.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.980
 We will do an entire episode on dopamine and learning,

42:51.980 --> 42:54.820
 but because some of you are probably wondering,

42:54.820 --> 42:56.620
 this does not mean that just increasing

42:56.620 --> 42:58.220
 your dopamine levels before learning

42:58.220 --> 42:59.780
 will allow you to learn faster.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.820
 In fact, increasing your dopamine levels

43:02.820 --> 43:05.180
 before learning using pharmacology

43:05.180 --> 43:07.900
 will actually reduce what's called the signal to noise.

43:07.900 --> 43:10.360
 It will make these increases in dopamine

43:10.360 --> 43:13.160
 that pop up in your brain that suddenly make you realize,

43:13.160 --> 43:14.700
 ah, I got that one right.

43:14.700 --> 43:16.500
 It will make those smaller

43:16.500 --> 43:20.380
 relative to the background levels of dopamine, okay?

43:20.380 --> 43:22.500
 You want a big spike in dopamine

43:22.500 --> 43:25.020
 when you perform a motor pattern correctly,

43:25.020 --> 43:27.060
 and you want to make lots of errors,

43:27.060 --> 43:29.600
 many, many repetitions of errors

43:29.600 --> 43:32.140
 in order to get to that correct performance.

43:32.140 --> 43:33.940
 Now, if you're like most people,

43:33.940 --> 43:37.740
 you're going to do this in a way that's somewhat random,

43:37.740 --> 43:39.420
 meaning, let's say it's a tennis serve,

43:39.420 --> 43:40.580
 I can't play tennis,

43:40.580 --> 43:42.840
 I think I've probably played tennis twice.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.500
 So if I throw the ball up in the air and hit it,

43:44.500 --> 43:46.540
 I'm going to get it wrong and probably hit the net,

43:46.540 --> 43:47.380
 then I'm going to hit the net.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.720
 Then I'll probably go too long,

43:48.720 --> 43:50.140
 then I'll probably go over the fence.

43:50.140 --> 43:52.860
 At some point, I like to think I'll get it correct.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.340
 The dopamine signal for that is going to be quite big,

43:57.340 --> 43:59.540
 and I'll think, okay, what did I do there?

43:59.540 --> 44:01.300
 I actually don't know, I wasn't paying attention.

44:01.300 --> 44:03.340
 What I was paying attention to is whether or not the ball

44:03.340 --> 44:04.680
 went to the correct location

44:04.680 --> 44:05.740
 on the opposite side of the net.

44:05.740 --> 44:07.580
 Remember, it's an open loop move,

44:07.580 --> 44:09.820
 so I don't actually know what I did correctly,

44:09.820 --> 44:12.200
 but your nervous system will take care of that

44:12.200 --> 44:14.660
 provided I, in this case,

44:14.660 --> 44:17.120
 complete more and more and more repetitions.

44:17.120 --> 44:20.020
 Now, if I were to just elevate my basal level of dopamine

44:20.020 --> 44:21.000
 by taking, I don't know,

44:21.000 --> 44:24.060
 1,500 milligrams of L-tyrosine or something,

44:24.060 --> 44:26.460
 that would be bad because the increase in dopamine

44:26.460 --> 44:29.680
 would actually be much lower, right?

44:29.680 --> 44:31.340
 We would say the delta is smaller,

44:31.340 --> 44:33.260
 the signal to noise is smaller

44:33.260 --> 44:35.780
 if my overall levels of dopamine are very, very high,

44:35.780 --> 44:37.800
 so I'm actually going to learn less well.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.420
 So for skill learning, motor skill learning,

44:40.420 --> 44:44.100
 increasing your dopamine levels prior is not a good idea.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.540
 It might help with motivation to get to the learning,

44:46.540 --> 44:49.460
 but it's not going to improve the plasticity process itself

44:49.460 --> 44:51.940
 and it's likely to hinder it,

44:51.940 --> 44:53.620
 and so that's very important.

44:53.620 --> 44:58.620
 So these errors cue the brain that something was wrong

44:59.340 --> 45:01.940
 and they open up the possibility for plasticity.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.820
 It's what's sometimes called the framing effect.

45:03.820 --> 45:05.660
 It frames what's important,

45:05.660 --> 45:08.660
 and so I think this is a shift that we've heard about,

45:08.660 --> 45:12.360
 you know, growth mindset, which is the incredible discovery

45:12.360 --> 45:14.780
 and theory and practice of my colleague,

45:14.780 --> 45:15.820
 Carol Dweck at Stanford.

45:15.820 --> 45:17.740
 This is distinct from that, right?

45:17.740 --> 45:20.060
 This isn't about motivation to learn.

45:20.060 --> 45:21.560
 This is about how you actually learn.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.740
 So the key is designate a particular block of time

45:24.740 --> 45:27.700
 that you are going to perform repetitions.

45:27.700 --> 45:30.140
 So maybe that's 30 minutes, maybe that's an hour.

45:30.140 --> 45:33.740
 Work for time and then try and perform the maximum number

45:33.740 --> 45:36.140
 of repetitions that you can do safely

45:36.140 --> 45:39.020
 for you and others per unit time.

45:39.020 --> 45:42.780
 That's going to be the best way to approach learning

45:42.780 --> 45:44.020
 for most sessions.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.420
 I will talk about other things that one can do,

45:46.420 --> 45:48.200
 but making errors is key,

45:48.200 --> 45:49.700
 and this isn't a motivational speech.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.360
 I'm not saying, oh, go make errors.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.260
 Errors are good for you.

45:52.260 --> 45:53.780
 You have to fail in order to win.

45:53.780 --> 45:56.780
 No, you have to fail in order to open up

45:56.780 --> 45:58.340
 the possibility of plasticity,

45:58.340 --> 46:02.160
 but you have to fail many times within the same session,

46:02.160 --> 46:05.060
 and those failures will cue your attention

46:05.060 --> 46:06.880
 to the appropriate sensory events.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.060
 Now, sometimes we're working with a coach,

46:09.060 --> 46:11.700
 and so this is a shout out to all the coaches.

46:11.700 --> 46:13.780
 Thank you for doing what you do.

46:13.780 --> 46:17.200
 However, there needs to be,

46:17.200 --> 46:19.620
 at least what the scientific literature say,

46:19.620 --> 46:21.940
 there needs to be a period of each training session

46:21.940 --> 46:25.400
 whereby the athlete or the person of any kind

46:25.400 --> 46:27.760
 can simply pay attention to their errors

46:27.760 --> 46:31.020
 without their attention being cued to something else.

46:31.020 --> 46:32.540
 A really well-trained coach will say,

46:32.540 --> 46:34.580
 oh, you know, your elbow's swinging too high

46:34.580 --> 46:36.460
 or you're not gripping the racket

46:36.460 --> 46:38.340
 in the appropriate way, et cetera.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.860
 They can see things that the practitioner can't see,

46:40.860 --> 46:43.000
 and of course that's vitally important,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.780
 but the practitioner also needs

46:45.780 --> 46:49.940
 to use this error recognition signal.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.940
 They need to basically focus on something,

46:52.940 --> 46:56.160
 and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.420
 So put simply, there needs to be a period of time

46:59.420 --> 47:01.380
 in which it's just repetition after repetition

47:01.380 --> 47:02.220
 after repetition.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.460
 I think many people, including coaches,

47:04.460 --> 47:07.420
 are afraid that bad habits will get ingrained,

47:07.420 --> 47:10.060
 and while indeed that's possible,

47:10.060 --> 47:12.480
 it's very important that these errors occur

47:12.480 --> 47:14.700
 in order to cue the attentional systems

47:14.700 --> 47:16.920
 and to open the door for plasticity.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.820
 So if I'm told, look, you know, I'm standing a little wide,

47:19.820 --> 47:22.780
 I need to tighten up my stance a little bit, great,

47:22.780 --> 47:24.680
 but then I need to generate many repetitions

47:24.680 --> 47:26.340
 from that tightened stance, okay?

47:26.340 --> 47:28.460
 So if I'm constantly being cued from the outside

47:28.460 --> 47:30.260
 about what I'm doing incorrectly,

47:30.260 --> 47:32.460
 that's not going to be as efficient, okay?

47:32.460 --> 47:34.900
 So for some people, these learning sessions

47:34.900 --> 47:35.820
 might be 10 minutes.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.340
 For some people, it might be an hour.

47:37.340 --> 47:40.800
 Whatever you can allocate, because your lifestyles will vary

47:40.800 --> 47:42.620
 and whether or not you're a professional athlete,

47:42.620 --> 47:43.920
 et cetera, will vary,

47:43.920 --> 47:46.260
 you want to get the maximum number of repetitions in

47:46.260 --> 47:47.540
 and you want to make errors.

47:47.540 --> 47:49.780
 That's allowing for plasticity.

47:49.780 --> 47:51.460
 So science points to the fact

47:51.460 --> 47:55.500
 that there's a particular sequencing of learning sessions

47:55.500 --> 47:57.360
 that will allow you to learn faster

47:57.360 --> 47:59.740
 and to retain the skill learning,

47:59.740 --> 48:03.000
 and it involves doing exactly as I just described,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.060
 which is getting as many repetitions as you can

48:06.060 --> 48:07.340
 in the learning session,

48:08.660 --> 48:11.120
 paying attention to the errors that you make,

48:12.020 --> 48:14.640
 and then the rewards that will be generated,

48:14.640 --> 48:16.580
 again, these are neurochemical rewards,

48:16.580 --> 48:18.900
 from the successful performance of a movement

48:18.900 --> 48:22.340
 or the approximate successful performance.

48:22.340 --> 48:25.940
 So maybe you get the golf swing better, but not perfect,

48:25.940 --> 48:28.300
 but that's still going to be rewarded

48:28.300 --> 48:30.620
 with this neurochemical mechanism.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.700
 And then after the session,

48:32.700 --> 48:37.440
 you need to do something very specific, which is nothing.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.680
 That's right.

48:40.900 --> 48:45.100
 There are beautiful data describing neurons

48:45.100 --> 48:47.100
 in our hippocampus,

48:47.100 --> 48:49.860
 this area of our brain involved in the consolidation

48:49.860 --> 48:50.960
 of new memories.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.900
 Those data point to the fact that in sleep,

48:54.900 --> 48:59.180
 there's a replay of the sequence of neurons

48:59.180 --> 49:01.940
 that were involved in certain behaviors the previous day,

49:01.940 --> 49:04.340
 and sometimes the previous day before that.

49:05.220 --> 49:08.500
 However, there are also data that show

49:08.500 --> 49:11.060
 that after a skill learning session,

49:11.060 --> 49:13.020
 any kind of motor movement,

49:14.660 --> 49:16.460
 provided you're not bringing in

49:16.460 --> 49:20.180
 a lot more additional new sensory stimuli,

49:20.180 --> 49:24.420
 there's a replay of the motor sequence

49:24.420 --> 49:26.740
 that you performed correctly,

49:27.860 --> 49:30.920
 and there's an elimination of the motor sequences

49:30.920 --> 49:33.380
 that you performed incorrectly,

49:33.380 --> 49:37.700
 and they are run backward in time, okay?

49:37.700 --> 49:39.600
 So to be very clear about this,

49:39.600 --> 49:42.860
 if I were to learn a new skill or navigate a new city,

49:42.860 --> 49:44.940
 or let's just stay with the motor skill,

49:44.940 --> 49:49.140
 let's say the free throw or a golf swing or a tennis serve,

49:49.140 --> 49:51.440
 dance move novice,

49:51.440 --> 49:52.940
 so I'm still going to make a lot of errors,

49:52.940 --> 49:54.020
 don't get it perfectly,

49:54.020 --> 49:56.180
 but maybe I get a little bit better

49:56.180 --> 49:59.720
 where I perform it correctly three times out of 1,000,

49:59.720 --> 50:02.100
 and it sounds like something I might do,

50:02.100 --> 50:04.900
 and there I'm probably being generous to myself.

50:04.900 --> 50:06.840
 After I finished the training session,

50:07.780 --> 50:09.860
 if I do nothing,

50:09.860 --> 50:11.900
 I'm not focused on some additional learning,

50:11.900 --> 50:15.580
 I'm not bringing a lot of sensory information in,

50:15.580 --> 50:17.500
 if I just sit there and close my eyes

50:17.500 --> 50:21.460
 for five to 10 minutes, even one minute,

50:21.460 --> 50:24.220
 the brain starts to replay the motor sequence

50:25.260 --> 50:28.120
 corresponding to the correct pattern of movement,

50:28.120 --> 50:30.860
 but it plays that sequence backward.

50:30.860 --> 50:34.300
 Now, why it plays it backward, we don't know.

50:34.300 --> 50:36.300
 If I were to wait until sleep,

50:36.300 --> 50:39.360
 or regardless of when I sleep later that night,

50:41.260 --> 50:44.320
 the sequence will be replayed forwards

50:44.320 --> 50:46.400
 in the proper sequence,

50:46.400 --> 50:49.440
 immediately afterward, it's played backward

50:49.440 --> 50:51.620
 for reasons that are still unclear,

50:51.620 --> 50:54.640
 but the replay of that sequence backwards

50:54.640 --> 50:56.280
 appears to be important

50:56.280 --> 50:59.880
 for the consolidation of the skill learning.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.560
 Now, this is important

51:01.560 --> 51:05.040
 because many people are finishing their jujitsu class,

51:05.040 --> 51:06.600
 or they're finishing their yoga class,

51:06.600 --> 51:08.080
 or they're finishing their dance class,

51:08.080 --> 51:09.840
 or they're finishing some skill learning,

51:09.840 --> 51:12.240
 and then they're immediately devoting their attention

51:12.240 --> 51:13.280
 to something else.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.080
 You hear a lot about visualization,

51:16.080 --> 51:18.640
 and we are going to talk about visualization,

51:18.640 --> 51:20.720
 but in the kind of obsession

51:20.720 --> 51:22.160
 with the idea that we can learn things

51:22.160 --> 51:24.020
 just sitting there with our eyes closed

51:24.020 --> 51:25.760
 without having to perform a movement,

51:25.760 --> 51:29.460
 we've overlooked something perhaps even more important,

51:29.460 --> 51:30.820
 or at least equally important,

51:30.820 --> 51:33.100
 which is after skill learning,

51:33.100 --> 51:35.280
 after putting effort into something,

51:35.280 --> 51:37.600
 sitting quietly with the eyes closed

51:38.480 --> 51:41.640
 for one to five to 10 minutes

51:41.640 --> 51:44.380
 allows the brain to replay the sequence

51:44.380 --> 51:46.440
 in a way that appears important

51:46.440 --> 51:48.800
 for the more rapid consolidation

51:48.800 --> 51:51.660
 of the motor sequence of the pattern

51:51.660 --> 51:53.580
 and to accelerated learning.

51:53.580 --> 51:55.840
 If you'd like to learn more about this,

51:55.840 --> 51:57.540
 this is not work that I was involved in.

51:57.540 --> 51:58.960
 I want to be very clear.

51:58.960 --> 52:02.000
 There's an excellent paper that covers this and much more

52:02.000 --> 52:03.720
 for those of you that really want to dive deep on this,

52:03.720 --> 52:05.800
 and we will dive deeper in a moment.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.820
 This is a review that was published in the journal Neuron,

52:08.820 --> 52:10.040
 excellent journal.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.860
 Many of the papers that I'm referring to

52:12.860 --> 52:15.100
 were covered in this review,

52:15.100 --> 52:16.920
 which is titled neuroplasticity

52:16.920 --> 52:19.120
 sub-serving motor skill learning

52:19.120 --> 52:21.960
 by Dayan, D-A-Y-A-N,

52:21.960 --> 52:24.060
 I hope I'm not butchering the pronunciation,

52:24.060 --> 52:25.880
 and Cohen by Leonard Cohen,

52:25.880 --> 52:29.940
 but not the Leonard Cohen most of us are familiar with,

52:29.940 --> 52:32.460
 the musician Leonard Cohen.

52:32.460 --> 52:34.100
 Dayan and Cohen,

52:34.100 --> 52:37.140
 neuroplasticity sub-serving motor skill learning,

52:37.140 --> 52:42.140
 and this was published in 2011,

52:42.140 --> 52:43.800
 but there have been a number of updates

52:43.800 --> 52:45.700
 and the literature that I've described

52:46.580 --> 52:48.780
 in other portions of today's episode

52:48.780 --> 52:50.540
 come from the more recent literature,

52:50.540 --> 52:53.040
 such as the more recent 2021 paper, okay?

52:53.040 --> 52:55.740
 So you have this basic learning session

52:55.740 --> 52:57.160
 and then a period of time afterwards

52:57.160 --> 52:59.500
 in which the brain can rehearse what it just did.

52:59.500 --> 53:01.340
 We hear so much about mental rehearsal,

53:01.340 --> 53:02.940
 and we always think about mental rehearsal

53:02.940 --> 53:06.720
 as the thing you do before you train or instead of training,

53:06.720 --> 53:08.940
 but this is rehearsal that's done afterward

53:08.940 --> 53:11.380
 where the brain is just automatically scripting

53:11.380 --> 53:12.260
 through the sequence,

53:12.260 --> 53:15.220
 and for some reason that's still not clear

53:15.220 --> 53:18.780
 as to why this would be the case, it runs backward.

53:18.780 --> 53:21.540
 Then in sleep, it runs forwards,

53:21.540 --> 53:23.780
 and certainly, absolutely,

53:23.780 --> 53:26.940
 sleep and quality sleep of the appropriate duration, et cetera

53:26.940 --> 53:28.900
 is going to be important for learning of all kinds,

53:28.900 --> 53:29.900
 including skill learning.

53:29.900 --> 53:32.980
 We did an entire four episodes on sleep

53:32.980 --> 53:34.020
 and how to get better at sleeping.

53:34.020 --> 53:35.560
 Those are the episodes back in January,

53:35.560 --> 53:38.260
 episodes essentially one, two, three, and four,

53:38.260 --> 53:42.300
 and maybe even episode five, I don't recall,

53:42.300 --> 53:44.340
 but you can go there to find out

53:44.340 --> 53:46.840
 all about how to get better at sleeping.

53:46.840 --> 53:50.140
 Now, there are other training sessions involved, right?

53:50.140 --> 53:51.760
 I'm not going to learn the perfect golf swing

53:51.760 --> 53:54.840
 or the tennis serve or how to dance in one session,

53:56.360 --> 53:58.300
 and I doubt you will either.

53:58.300 --> 54:00.540
 So the question is when to come back

54:00.540 --> 54:03.120
 and what to do when you come back to the training session.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.340
 Now, first of all,

54:05.340 --> 54:08.540
 this principle of errors, cuing attention

54:08.540 --> 54:11.840
 and opening the opportunity for plasticity,

54:12.920 --> 54:14.400
 that's never going to change.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.220
 That's going to be true for somebody who is hyper-skilled,

54:17.220 --> 54:21.540
 who's even has mastery or even virtuosity

54:21.540 --> 54:23.820
 in a given skill, right?

54:23.820 --> 54:26.320
 Remember, when you're unskilled at something,

54:26.320 --> 54:27.580
 uncertainty is very high.

54:27.580 --> 54:30.640
 As you become more skilled, certainty goes up, right?

54:30.640 --> 54:32.760
 Then eventually you achieve levels of mastery

54:32.760 --> 54:35.460
 where certainty is very, very high about your ability

54:35.460 --> 54:38.820
 to perform yours certainty and that of other people.

54:38.820 --> 54:42.760
 And then there's this fourth category of virtuosity

54:42.760 --> 54:44.820
 where somebody, maybe you,

54:44.820 --> 54:47.280
 invites uncertainty back into the practice

54:47.280 --> 54:49.220
 because only with that uncertainty

54:49.220 --> 54:52.700
 can you express your full range of abilities,

54:52.700 --> 54:54.020
 which you aren't even aware of

54:54.020 --> 54:56.880
 until uncertainty comes into the picture, right?

54:56.880 --> 55:00.820
 I happen to have the great privilege

55:00.820 --> 55:03.080
 of being friends with Laird Hamilton,

55:03.080 --> 55:05.400
 the big wave surfer, who's phenomenal.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.500
 I don't surf.

55:06.500 --> 55:08.240
 I certainly don't surf with Laird,

55:08.240 --> 55:11.260
 but he and another guy that he surfs with,

55:11.260 --> 55:16.240
 Luca Padua, these guys, they're virtuosos at surfing.

55:16.240 --> 55:19.280
 They don't just want the wave that they can master.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.540
 They want uncertainty.

55:20.540 --> 55:22.160
 They're at the point in their practice

55:22.160 --> 55:24.780
 where when uncertainty shows up,

55:24.780 --> 55:27.200
 like a wave that's either so big

55:27.200 --> 55:31.020
 or is moving in a particular way

55:31.020 --> 55:33.960
 that it brings an element of uncertainty for them

55:33.960 --> 55:35.120
 about what they're going to do,

55:35.120 --> 55:37.460
 that they recognize that as the opportunity

55:37.460 --> 55:39.940
 to perform better than they would otherwise, okay?

55:39.940 --> 55:42.380
 So they're actually trying to eliminate uncertainty.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.260
 At the beginning of learning any skill

55:44.260 --> 55:47.420
 and as we approach from uncertain to skilled to mastery,

55:47.420 --> 55:49.380
 we want to reduce uncertainty.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.980
 And that's really what the nervous system is doing.

55:50.980 --> 55:52.340
 It's trying to eliminate errors

55:52.340 --> 55:55.000
 and hone in on the correct trajectories.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.680
 If you perform a lot of repetitions

55:59.680 --> 56:02.720
 and then you use a period immediately after,

56:02.720 --> 56:03.960
 we don't really have a name for this.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.160
 Maybe someone will come up with it

56:05.160 --> 56:07.840
 and put it in the comment section if you're on YouTube,

56:07.840 --> 56:09.480
 if you're watching this on YouTube,

56:09.480 --> 56:12.400
 a name for this post-learning kind of idle time

56:12.400 --> 56:14.320
 for the brain, the brain isn't idle at all.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.740
 It's actually scripting all these things in reverse

56:16.740 --> 56:21.460
 that allow for deeper learning and more quick learning.

56:21.460 --> 56:24.380
 But if we fill that time with other things,

56:24.380 --> 56:26.180
 if we are focused on our phones

56:26.180 --> 56:27.880
 or we're focused on learning something else,

56:27.880 --> 56:30.580
 we're focusing on our performance,

56:30.580 --> 56:32.240
 that's not going to serve us well.

56:32.240 --> 56:33.220
 It's at least it's not going to serve

56:33.220 --> 56:34.080
 the skill learning well.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.440
 So please, if you're interested in more rapid skill learning

56:36.440 --> 56:39.640
 try introducing these sessions, they can be quite powerful.

56:39.640 --> 56:41.280
 And then on subsequent sessions,

56:41.280 --> 56:43.200
 presumably after a night's sleep

56:43.200 --> 56:44.680
 or maybe you're doing two sessions a day,

56:44.680 --> 56:46.520
 although two sessions a day is going to be a lot

56:46.520 --> 56:48.320
 for most people, unless you're a professional

56:48.320 --> 56:51.080
 or a high level athlete.

56:51.080 --> 56:56.080
 The subsequent sessions are where you get to express

56:56.760 --> 56:59.420
 the gains of the previous session, right?

56:59.420 --> 57:03.140
 Where you get to perform well, presumably more often,

57:03.140 --> 57:04.080
 even if it's just subtle,

57:04.080 --> 57:06.060
 sometimes there'll be a decrease in performance,

57:06.060 --> 57:08.780
 but most often you're going to perform better

57:08.780 --> 57:12.320
 on subsequent and subsequent training sessions.

57:12.320 --> 57:16.360
 And there is the opportunity to devote attention

57:16.360 --> 57:18.900
 in very specific ways, right?

57:18.900 --> 57:22.120
 Not just let the errors inform you

57:22.120 --> 57:23.440
 where to place your attention,

57:23.440 --> 57:27.560
 but rather to direct your perception

57:27.560 --> 57:30.120
 to particular elements of the movement

57:30.120 --> 57:33.000
 in order to accelerate learning further, okay?

57:33.000 --> 57:34.960
 So to be very clear,

57:34.960 --> 57:36.680
 cause I know many of you are interested

57:36.680 --> 57:38.760
 in concrete protocols.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.220
 It's not just that you would only let errors

57:41.220 --> 57:43.260
 cue your attention on the first session.

57:43.260 --> 57:45.960
 You might do that for one session or five sessions,

57:45.960 --> 57:47.040
 it's going to depend.

57:47.040 --> 57:48.720
 But once you're familiar with something

57:48.720 --> 57:51.040
 and you're performing it well every once in a while,

57:51.040 --> 57:54.720
 you're accomplishing it better every once in a while,

57:54.720 --> 57:56.440
 then you can start to cue your attention

57:56.440 --> 57:58.420
 in very deliberate ways.

57:58.420 --> 58:00.120
 And the question therefore becomes

58:00.120 --> 58:02.500
 what to cue your attention to.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.580
 And the good news is it doesn't matter.

58:07.520 --> 58:09.280
 There is a beautiful set of experiments

58:09.280 --> 58:13.520
 that have been done looking at sequences of keys

58:13.520 --> 58:15.440
 being played on a piano.

58:15.440 --> 58:18.120
 This is work that was published just a couple of years ago.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.000
 There are actually several papers now

58:20.000 --> 58:22.040
 that are focused on this.

58:22.040 --> 58:24.320
 One of them was published in 2018.

58:24.320 --> 58:29.320
 This is from Claudia Lape and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.

58:29.340 --> 58:30.880
 She's done some really nice work,

58:30.880 --> 58:33.920
 which talks about the influence of pitch feedback

58:33.920 --> 58:36.080
 on learning of motor timing and sequencing.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.640
 And this was done with piano,

58:37.640 --> 58:40.160
 but it carries over to athletic performance as well.

58:40.160 --> 58:42.300
 So I'm going to describe this study to you.

58:42.300 --> 58:44.940
 But before I describe it,

58:44.940 --> 58:47.560
 what is so interesting about this study

58:47.560 --> 58:49.200
 that I want you to know about

58:49.200 --> 58:53.740
 is that it turns out it doesn't matter so much

58:53.740 --> 58:57.040
 what you pay attention to during the learning sequence,

58:57.040 --> 58:59.880
 provided it's something related to the motor behavior

58:59.880 --> 59:01.720
 that you're performing, right?

59:01.720 --> 59:03.280
 That seems incredible, right?

59:03.280 --> 59:06.400
 I'm not good at a tennis serve.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.920
 So if I've done, you know,

59:07.920 --> 59:09.880
 let's say a thousand repetitions of the tennis serve,

59:09.880 --> 59:12.080
 maybe I got it right three to 10 times.

59:12.080 --> 59:13.700
 Now I'm being even more generous with myself.

59:13.700 --> 59:16.080
 And I do this post-training session

59:16.080 --> 59:18.600
 where I let my brain idle and I get some good sleep

59:18.600 --> 59:21.980
 and I come back and now I start generating errors again,

59:21.980 --> 59:24.720
 presumably or hopefully fewer errors,

59:24.720 --> 59:26.520
 but I decide I'm going to cue my attention

59:26.520 --> 59:27.640
 to something very specific,

59:27.640 --> 59:30.840
 like maybe how tightly I'm holding the racket,

59:30.840 --> 59:32.280
 or maybe it's my stance,

59:32.280 --> 59:36.120
 or maybe it's whether or not I rotate my right shoulder in

59:36.120 --> 59:38.700
 as I hit the ball across the net, I'm making this up again.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.200
 I don't play tennis.

59:40.200 --> 59:43.340
 It turns out that as long as it's the same thing

59:43.340 --> 59:46.240
 throughout the session, learning is accelerated.

59:46.240 --> 59:50.620
 And I'll explain why this makes sense in a moment,

59:50.620 --> 59:55.180
 but just to be really clear, you can, and one should,

59:56.300 --> 59:58.640
 use your powers of attention to direct your attention

59:58.640 --> 1:00:00.360
 to particular aspects of a motor movement.

1:00:00.360 --> 1:00:03.440
 Once you're familiar with the general theme of the movement,

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:06.520
 but what you pay attention to exactly is not important.

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:09.080
 What's important is that you pay attention

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:11.040
 to one specific thing.

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.020
 So what Claudia Lappe and colleagues showed

1:00:13.020 --> 1:00:17.080
 was that if people are trying to learn a sequence of keys

1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:21.480
 on the piano, there are multiple forms of feedback.

1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:22.680
 There are error signals.

1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:25.340
 If, for instance, they hear a piece of music

1:00:25.340 --> 1:00:26.600
 and then they're told to press the keys

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:30.940
 in a particular sequence and the noise that comes out,

1:00:30.940 --> 1:00:33.460
 the sound that comes out of the piano

1:00:33.460 --> 1:00:35.760
 does not sound like the song they just heard, right?

1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:37.780
 So instead of, and here, forgive me,

1:00:37.780 --> 1:00:40.920
 because I'm neither musical nor can I sing,

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:44.160
 but instead of, da, da, da, da, da, da,

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:46.480
 they hear that, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:48.560
 and then instead when they play,

1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:50.460
 or if it were me, it would sound something like,

1:00:50.460 --> 1:00:53.920
 da, da, da, da, da, da, it wouldn't sound right, okay?

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:55.800
 It wouldn't sound right because I likely got

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:58.180
 the sequence wrong or I was pressing too hard on the keys

1:00:58.180 --> 1:01:00.600
 or too lightly on the keys, et cetera.

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:06.640
 What they showed was if they just instruct people

1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:10.020
 about the correct sequence to press on the keys,

1:01:10.020 --> 1:01:12.480
 it actually doesn't matter what sound comes back

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:17.480
 provided it's the correct sound or it's the same sound.

1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:19.280
 All right, so here's the experiment.

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:21.040
 They had people press on these keys

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:22.960
 and it was a typical piano

1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:25.240
 and it generated the particular sequence of sounds

1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:28.640
 that would be generated by pressing the keys on the piano.

1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:33.040
 Or they modified the keyboard, in this case, or piano,

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:35.840
 such that when people pressed on the keys,

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.880
 a random tone, different tones were played

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.480
 each time they pressed on the keys.

1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:43.020
 So it sounded crazy, it sounded like noise,

1:01:43.020 --> 1:01:46.160
 but the motor sequence was the same.

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:48.680
 Or they had a single tone

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:52.360
 that was played every time they pressed a key

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:54.400
 and the job or the task of the subject

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:58.280
 was just to press the keys in the proper sequence.

1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:00.080
 So instead of da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:03.400
 it was just da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:05.040
 Instead of da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:06.720
 it's da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:10.080
 It's even hard for me to say an even tone,

1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:10.960
 but you get the idea.

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:13.920
 So a singular tone, just think a doorbell being rung

1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:16.880
 with each press of the key would be really annoying, okay?

1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:21.760
 But it turns out that the rate to motor learning

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:27.060
 was the same whether or not they were getting feedback

1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:29.280
 that was accurate to the keys of the piano

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:32.000
 or whether or not it was a constant tone.

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.820
 Performance was terrible

1:02:33.820 --> 1:02:35.760
 and the rates of learning were terrible

1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:38.160
 if they were getting random tones back.

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:40.680
 So what this means is that learning to play the piano

1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:42.480
 at least at these early stages

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:46.240
 is really just about generating the motor commands.

1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:49.360
 It's not about paying attention to the sound

1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:51.320
 that's coming out of the piano.

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.280
 And this makes sense because when we are beginners,

1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.320
 we are trying to focus our attention

1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:58.680
 on the things that we can control.

1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:03.660
 And if you think about this, if you conceptualize this,

1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:06.440
 pressing the keys on the piano and paying attention

1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:08.920
 to the sounds that are coming out are two things.

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:12.200
 So what this means is that as you get deeper

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:14.420
 and deeper into a practice,

1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:18.980
 focusing purely on the motor execution can be beneficial.

1:03:18.980 --> 1:03:20.960
 Now, this is going to be harder to do

1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:24.720
 with open loop type things where you're getting feedback.

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:26.320
 I guess a good example of open loop

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.200
 would be the attempt at a back flip, right?

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.320
 If you get it wrong, you will immediately know.

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:32.160
 If you get it right, you'll immediately know.

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:33.820
 Please don't go out and try and do a back flip

1:03:33.820 --> 1:03:35.840
 on the solid ground or even on a trampoline

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:37.300
 if you don't know what you're doing,

1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:39.200
 because very likely you'll get it wrong

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:40.340
 and you'll get injured.

1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:44.160
 But if it's something that is closed loop

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:46.920
 where you can repeat again and again and again and again,

1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:48.480
 that is advantageous

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:51.180
 because you can perform many, many repetitions

1:03:51.180 --> 1:03:54.460
 and you can start to focus or learn to focus your attention

1:03:54.460 --> 1:03:57.040
 just on the pattern of movement.

1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:59.620
 In other words, you can learn to play the piano

1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:02.440
 just as fast or maybe even faster

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:04.300
 by just focusing on the sequence

1:04:04.300 --> 1:04:06.320
 that you are moving your digits, your fingers,

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:07.760
 and not the feedback.

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:09.640
 Now, I'm sure there are music teachers out there

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:10.960
 and piano teachers that are screaming,

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:13.120
 no, you're going to ruin the practice

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:15.800
 that all of us have embedded in our minds

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:18.000
 and in our students, and I agree.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.360
 At some point, you need to start including feedback

1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:24.280
 about whether or not things sound correct.

1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:26.600
 But one of the beauties of skill learning

1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:29.040
 is that you can choose to parameterize it,

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:31.900
 meaning you can choose to just focus on the motor sequence

1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:34.280
 or just focus on the sounds that are coming back

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:36.500
 and then integrate those.

1:04:36.500 --> 1:04:38.800
 And so we hear a lot about chunking,

1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:41.460
 about breaking things down into their component parts.

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:43.580
 But one of the biggest challenges for skill learning

1:04:43.580 --> 1:04:45.760
 is knowing where to place your attention.

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:47.200
 So to dial out again,

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:49.640
 we're building a protocol across this episode.

1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:51.700
 Early sessions, maybe it's the first one,

1:04:51.700 --> 1:04:54.520
 maybe it's the first 10, maybe it's the first 100.

1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:57.200
 It depends on how many repetitions you're packing in.

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:58.980
 But during those initial sessions,

1:04:58.980 --> 1:05:00.640
 the key is to make many errors,

1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:04.480
 to let the reward process govern the plasticity,

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:06.880
 let the errors open the plasticity,

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:08.920
 and then after the learning sessions,

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:10.920
 to let the brain go idle,

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:12.240
 at least for a short period of time,

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:13.780
 and of course, to maximize sleep.

1:05:13.780 --> 1:05:16.080
 As you start incorporating more sessions,

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:19.800
 you start to gain some skill level,

1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:22.000
 learning to harness and focus your attention

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.360
 on particular features of the movement,

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:28.880
 independent of the rewards and the feedback, right?

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:31.200
 So the reward is no longer in the tone

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:32.400
 coming from the piano,

1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:34.360
 or whether or not you struck the target correctly,

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.320
 but simply the motor movement,

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:39.360
 focusing your, for instance, in a dart throw,

1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:41.320
 on the action of your arm.

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:43.640
 That is embedding the plasticity

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:45.600
 in the motor pattern most deeply.

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:48.020
 That's what's been shown by the scientific literature.

1:05:48.020 --> 1:05:49.940
 I'm sure there are coaches and teachers out there

1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:52.800
 that will entirely disagree with me, and that's great.

1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:54.960
 Please let me know what you prefer.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:57.680
 Let me know where you think this is wrong.

1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.200
 And it rarely happens,

1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:01.840
 but let me know where you think this might be right as well.

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:03.360
 So we're breaking the learning process

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:05.360
 down into its component parts.

1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:07.040
 As we get more and more skilled,

1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:09.540
 meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors

1:06:09.540 --> 1:06:12.720
 per a given session per unit time,

1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:16.340
 that's when attention can start to migrate

1:06:16.340 --> 1:06:19.620
 from one feature, such as the motor sequence,

1:06:19.620 --> 1:06:24.120
 to another feature, which is perhaps one's stance,

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:26.760
 and another component of the sequence,

1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:28.720
 which would be the result that's one getting

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:31.960
 on a trial-to-trial basis, right?

1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:33.000
 So changing it up each time.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.240
 So maybe I serve the tennis ball,

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.560
 and I'm focusing on where the ball lands,

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:39.120
 and then I'm focusing on the speed,

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:40.200
 then I'm focusing on my grip,

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:43.880
 then I'm focusing on my stance, from trial to trial.

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:47.080
 But until we've mastered the core motor movements,

1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:49.320
 which is done session to session,

1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:51.280
 that, at least according to the literature

1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:55.220
 that I have access to here, seems to be suboptimal.

1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:57.560
 So hopefully this is starting to make sense,

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.160
 which is that these connections

1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:02.280
 between upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons,

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.200
 and central pattern generators,

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:06.040
 you can't attack them all at once.

1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:07.480
 You can't try and change them all at once.

1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:09.160
 And so what we're doing is we're breaking things down

1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:11.280
 into their component parts.

1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:14.500
 Some of you may be wondering about speed of movement.

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:17.520
 There are some data,

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:19.600
 meaning some decent papers out there,

1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:22.020
 showing that ultra slow movements,

1:07:22.020 --> 1:07:26.020
 performing a movement essentially in slow motion,

1:07:26.020 --> 1:07:31.020
 can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning.

1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:35.000
 However, at least from my read of the literature,

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.080
 it appears that ultra slow movements

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:40.920
 should be performed after some degree of proficiency

1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:44.240
 has already been gained in that particular movement.

1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:46.060
 Now, that's not the way I would have thought about it.

1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:47.080
 I would have thought, well,

1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.360
 if you're learning how to do a proper kick

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:51.120
 or a punch in martial arts or something,

1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:53.140
 that ultra slow movements at first

1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:57.840
 are going to be the way that one can best learn

1:07:57.840 --> 1:07:59.000
 how to perform a movement.

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.920
 And then you just gradually increase the speed.

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:03.480
 And it turns out that's not the case.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.360
 And I probably should have known that.

1:08:05.360 --> 1:08:07.580
 And you should probably know that

1:08:07.580 --> 1:08:10.400
 because it turns out that when you do ultra slow movements,

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:12.360
 two things aren't available to you.

1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:16.040
 One is the proprioceptive feedback is not accurate

1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:18.840
 because fast movements of limbs are very different

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:20.760
 than slow movements of limbs.

1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:21.880
 So you don't get the opportunity

1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:24.420
 to build in the proprioceptive feedback.

1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:27.120
 But the other reason why it doesn't work

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.320
 is that it's too accurate.

1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:31.440
 You don't generate errors.

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:34.080
 And so the data that I was able to find

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:37.960
 showed that very slow movements can be beneficial

1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:40.800
 if one is already proficient in a practice,

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:43.080
 but very slow movements at the beginning

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:45.360
 don't allow you to learn more quickly

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:47.040
 because you never generate errors

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:50.560
 and therefore the brain doesn't, it's not open for change.

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:53.400
 And the window for plasticity is never swung open

1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:54.640
 so to speak.

1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:56.940
 So brings us back to this theme

1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:59.120
 that errors allow for plasticity,

1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:00.800
 correct performance of movements

1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:03.780
 or semi-correct performance of movements cues

1:09:03.780 --> 1:09:06.040
 the synapses in the brain areas

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:08.560
 and spinal circuits that need to change.

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:10.540
 And then those changes occur in the period

1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:13.800
 immediately after skill learning and in sleep.

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:16.600
 So super slow movements can be beneficial

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:18.520
 once you already have some proficiency.

1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:21.080
 So this might be standing in your living room

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:24.600
 and just in ultra slow motion performing your tennis serve,

1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:25.920
 learning to or thinking about

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:28.020
 how you're adjusting your elbow and your arm

1:09:28.020 --> 1:09:29.920
 and the trajectory exactly how you were taught

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:31.280
 by your tennis coach,

1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:34.240
 but trying to learn it that way from the outset

1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:37.940
 does not appear to be the best way to learn a skill.

1:09:37.940 --> 1:09:40.200
 When should you start to introduce slow learning?

1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:42.640
 Well, obviously talk to your coaches about this,

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.520
 but if you're doing this recreationally

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.880
 or you don't have a coach, I realize many of you don't,

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:50.140
 I don't have a coach for anything that I do.

1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:52.320
 I'm going to just navigating it

1:09:52.320 --> 1:09:54.600
 by using the scientific literature.

1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:56.800
 It appears that once you're hitting success rates

1:09:56.800 --> 1:09:59.200
 of about 25 or 30%,

1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:00.800
 that's where the super slow movements

1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:02.580
 can start to be beneficial.

1:10:02.580 --> 1:10:05.720
 But if you're still performing things at a rate

1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:09.160
 of five or 10% correct and the rest are errors,

1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:10.400
 then the super slow movements

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:13.160
 are probably not going to benefit you that much.

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:16.240
 Also super slow movements are not really applicable

1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:18.040
 to a lot of things.

1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:21.120
 For instance, you could imagine throwing a dart

1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:22.300
 super slow motion,

1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:24.600
 but if you actually try and throw an actual dart,

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:27.200
 the dart's just going to fall to the floor, obviously.

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:30.260
 So there are a number of things like baseball bat swing,

1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:32.800
 which you can practice in super slow motion,

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:34.880
 but if you try and do that with an actual baseball

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:36.400
 or softball or something like that,

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:38.520
 that's not going to give you any kind of feedback

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:39.940
 about how effective it was.

1:10:39.940 --> 1:10:44.360
 So super slow movements or a decelerated movement

1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:46.620
 has its place,

1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:50.200
 but once you're already performing things reasonably well,

1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:53.040
 like maybe 25 to 30% success rate.

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:54.600
 And I've tried this, I actually,

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:57.480
 I struggle with basketball for whatever reason

1:10:57.480 --> 1:10:59.140
 and my free throw is terrible.

1:10:59.140 --> 1:11:02.280
 So I've practiced free throws in super slow motion

1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:04.400
 and I nail them every time.

1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:06.280
 The problem is there's no ball.

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:09.280
 Some of you already have a fair degree of proficiency

1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.280
 of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument.

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.120
 And if you're in this sort of advanced intermediate

1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:22.640
 or advanced levels of proficiency for something,

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:27.000
 there is a practice that you can find interesting data for

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.640
 in the literature, which involves metronoming.

1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:35.640
 So this you'll realize relates to generating repetitions

1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:39.140
 and it relates to the tone experiment

1:11:39.140 --> 1:11:41.920
 where it doesn't really matter what your attention

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:44.800
 is cued to as long as you are performing many, many reps

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.820
 of the motor sequence.

1:11:46.820 --> 1:11:49.920
 You can use a metronome and obviously musicians do this,

1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:52.320
 but athletes can do this too.

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:54.840
 You can use a metronome to set the cadence

1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:56.760
 of your repetitions.

1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:00.160
 Now for swimmers, there's actually a device

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:01.400
 I was able to find online.

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:02.720
 I forget what the brand name was

1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:04.260
 and that's not what this is about,

1:12:04.260 --> 1:12:06.840
 but that actually goes in the swim cap

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.160
 that can cue you to when you need to perform another stroke.

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:14.160
 And for runners, there are other metronome type devices

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:16.900
 that through headphones or through a tone in the room

1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:18.960
 if you're running indoors or on a treadmill

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:20.640
 will cue you to when you basically

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:21.840
 you need to lift your heels.

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:24.120
 And if you do that, what athletes find

1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:26.320
 is they can perform more repetitions,

1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:29.560
 they can generate more output, you can increase speed.

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.240
 A number of really interesting things are being done

1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:33.660
 with auditory metronoming and then I'm involved

1:12:33.660 --> 1:12:35.600
 in a little bit of work now that hopefully

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:36.880
 I'll be able to report back to you

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.200
 about using stroboscopic metronoming.

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:42.000
 So actually changing the speed of the visual environment.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.720
 These are fun experiments,

1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:45.360
 basically changing one's perception

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:47.100
 of how fast they're moving through space

1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:48.980
 by playing with a visual system,

1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:50.680
 something for a future discussion.

1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:53.640
 But you can start to use auditory metronoming

1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:57.540
 for generating more movements per unit time

1:12:57.540 --> 1:13:00.800
 and generating more errors and therefore more successes

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:02.640
 and more neuroplasticity.

1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.840
 There are a number of different apps out there.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:06.360
 I found several free apps

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:07.880
 where you can set in a metronome pace.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:10.280
 So it might be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:11.760
 That's a little fast for most things

1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:14.280
 but you can imagine if this were darts

1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:17.760
 or this were golf swings that it might be tick, tick,

1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:20.920
 tick, tick or something more like tick, tick.

1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:23.280
 And every time the metronome goes, you swing.

1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:25.520
 Every time the metronome goes, you throw a dart.

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:27.400
 There are actually some wild experiments out there.

1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:29.880
 There's a world championship of cup stacking.

1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:33.120
 There's a young lady who I saw could take all these cups

1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:35.280
 spread out on a table and basically just stack them

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:37.120
 into the perfect pyramid in the least amount of times

1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.520
 all the kids go wild.

1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:40.660
 This is something I'd never thought to pursue

1:13:40.660 --> 1:13:42.840
 and frankly never will pursue

1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:44.920
 unless my life depends on it for some reason

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:46.280
 but it's really impressive.

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:48.080
 And if you look at the sequence

1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:49.240
 because these have been recorded

1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:51.580
 you can look this up on YouTube.

1:13:51.580 --> 1:13:54.600
 What you'll find is that these expert cup stackers

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:56.880
 it's just all about error elimination

1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.040
 but there too metronoming and auditory cues

1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:02.640
 can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster

1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:05.440
 than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that.

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:06.500
 You can do this for anything.

1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:08.920
 I think cup stacking is probably not a skill

1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:13.040
 most of you are interested in doing, but for any skill

1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:15.880
 if you figure out at what rate you are performing

1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:17.560
 repetitions per unit time

1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:20.880
 and you want to increase that slightly, you set a metronome

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:23.400
 which is slightly faster than your current rate

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:25.320
 and you just start generating more repetitions.

1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:27.920
 Now what's interesting about this and is cool

1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:31.840
 is it relates back to the experiment from

1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:34.240
 Lapé and colleagues which is

1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:38.040
 your attention is now harnessed to the tone

1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:39.400
 to the metronome

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:40.960
 not necessarily to what you're doing

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.400
 in terms of the motor movement.

1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:44.920
 And so really you need a bit of proficiency.

1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:47.120
 Again, this is for people who are intermediate

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:49.080
 or advanced, intermediate or advanced

1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:50.660
 but what you're essentially doing is

1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:54.160
 you're creating an outside pressure, a contingency

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:56.680
 so that you generate again, more errors.

1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:58.760
 So it's all about the errors that you get.

1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:00.640
 Now these aren't errors where all the cups tumble

1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:02.660
 or you have to stop or you can't keep up.

1:15:02.660 --> 1:15:04.440
 You have to set the pace just a little bit

1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:06.440
 beyond what you currently can do.

1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.560
 And when you do that, you're essentially

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.300
 forcing the nervous system to make errors

1:15:10.300 --> 1:15:12.720
 and correct the errors inside of the session.

1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:14.040
 I find this really interesting

1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:15.760
 because what it means is again,

1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:17.120
 you've got sensory perception

1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:18.800
 what you're paying attention to, proprioception

1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:20.800
 where your limbs are and the motor neurons

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:22.880
 in your upper, lower motor neurons

1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:24.840
 and central pattern generators.

1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:26.300
 And you can't pay attention to it.

1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:27.820
 Well, they're my upper motor neurons,

1:15:27.820 --> 1:15:28.760
 they're my lower motor neurons.

1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:30.520
 Forget that, you're not going to do that.

1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:33.840
 You can't pay attention to your proprioception too much.

1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:35.520
 That would be the super slow motion

1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:37.480
 would be the proprioception.

1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:41.200
 But you have to harness your attention to something.

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:42.480
 And if you harness your attention

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:44.640
 to this outside contingency, this metronome

1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:48.560
 that's firing off and saying, now, go, now, go, now, go.

1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:51.040
 Not only can you increase the number of repetitions,

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:54.600
 errors and successes, but for some reason

1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:57.640
 and we don't know why the regular cadence

1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:59.680
 of the tone of the metronome

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:02.680
 and the fact that you are anchoring your movements

1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:07.560
 to some external force, to some external pressure or cue

1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:10.360
 seems to accelerate the plasticity

1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:12.800
 and the changes and the acquisition of skills

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:13.800
 beyond what it would be

1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:15.860
 if you just did the same number of repetitions

1:16:15.860 --> 1:16:17.680
 without that outside pressure.

1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:19.380
 We don't know exactly what the mechanism is.

1:16:19.380 --> 1:16:21.540
 Presumably it's neurochemical.

1:16:21.540 --> 1:16:24.160
 Like there's something about keeping up with a timer

1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:28.120
 or with a pace that presumably, and I'm speculating here

1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:30.440
 causes the release of particular chemicals.

1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:31.880
 But I think it's really cool.

1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:34.200
 Metronomes, they're totally inexpensive.

1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:36.440
 At least the ones that you use outside of water

1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:37.440
 are very inexpensive.

1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:39.180
 You can find these free apps.

1:16:39.180 --> 1:16:40.800
 You can use a musical metronome.

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:43.880
 So metronomes are a powerful tool as well.

1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:45.600
 In particular for speed work.

1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:47.960
 So for sprinting or swimming or running

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:52.040
 where the goal is to generate more strokes

1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:55.820
 or more efficient strokes or more steps, et cetera.

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:57.400
 The rate of the metronome obviously

1:16:57.400 --> 1:16:59.280
 is going to be very important.

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:00.920
 Sometimes you're trying to lengthen your stride.

1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:02.880
 Sometimes you're trying to take fewer strokes

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:05.440
 but glide further in the pool, for instance.

1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:08.680
 But the value of occasionally

1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:10.880
 just increasing the number of repetitions,

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:13.800
 the number of strokes or steps, et cetera, per unit time

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:16.220
 is also that you're training the central pattern generators

1:17:16.220 --> 1:17:18.540
 to operate at that higher speed.

1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:21.240
 One of the sports that's kind of interesting to me

1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:22.360
 is speed walking.

1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:25.560
 It's not one I engage in or ever plan to engage in.

1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:27.660
 But if you've ever tried to really speed walk,

1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:30.120
 it's actually difficult to walk very, very fast

1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:31.720
 without breaking into a run.

1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:34.160
 All animals have these kind of crossover points

1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:36.720
 where they go, where you go,

1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:38.840
 I think with horses, it's like, what is it?

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.680
 They trot, then they gallop.

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:41.520
 I don't know what's the next thing.

1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:42.480
 I don't know clearly.

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:45.200
 I don't know anything about horses

1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:47.720
 except that they're beautiful and I like them very much.

1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:50.960
 But they break into a different kind of stride.

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.240
 And that's because you shift over

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:55.040
 to different central pattern generators.

1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:57.900
 So when you're walking or a horse is moving very slowly

1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:01.200
 and then it breaks into a jog and then into a full sprint

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.740
 or I got to get gallop for the horse,

1:18:03.740 --> 1:18:04.580
 you're actually engaging

1:18:04.580 --> 1:18:06.320
 different central pattern generators.

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:08.080
 And those central pattern generators

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:09.820
 always have a range of speeds

1:18:09.820 --> 1:18:12.020
 that they're happiest to function at.

1:18:12.020 --> 1:18:15.500
 So with the metronoming for speed purposes,

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:19.000
 what you do is you can basically bring the activity

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.320
 of those central pattern generators

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:21.840
 into their upper upper range

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:23.960
 and maybe even extend their range.

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.680
 And there's a fascinating biology

1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:28.120
 of how central pattern generators work together.

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:30.840
 There's coupling of central pattern generators, et cetera,

1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:33.620
 in order to achieve maximal speeds and et cetera.

1:18:33.620 --> 1:18:35.720
 It's a topic for kind of an advanced session.

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:37.160
 Costello loves this topic.

1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:40.520
 He just barked and loves it so much he barked again.

1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:43.020
 In any event, the metronome is a powerful tool,

1:18:43.020 --> 1:18:45.160
 again, for more advanced practitioners

1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:47.320
 or for advanced intermediate practitioners.

1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:52.320
 But it's interesting because it brings back the point

1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:54.240
 that what we put our attention to

1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:57.120
 while we're skill learning is important

1:18:57.120 --> 1:18:59.420
 to the extent that it's on one thing,

1:18:59.420 --> 1:19:02.080
 at least for the moment or trial to trial,

1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:07.080
 but that what we focus our attention on can be external.

1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:09.040
 It can be internal.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:10.380
 And ultimately the skill learning

1:19:10.380 --> 1:19:12.600
 is where all that is brought together.

1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:15.080
 So let's talk about where skill learning occurs

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:16.080
 in the nervous system.

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:19.260
 And then I'm going to give you a really,

1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:22.480
 what I think is a really cool tool

1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:26.120
 that can increase flexibility and range of motion

1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:27.840
 based on this particular brain area.

1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:30.080
 It's a tool that I used and when I first heard about,

1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:32.080
 I did not believe would work.

1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:32.960
 This is not a hack.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:35.400
 This is actually anchored deeply in the biology

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.640
 of a particular brain region that we all have

1:19:38.740 --> 1:19:40.860
 whose meaning is mini brain.

1:19:40.860 --> 1:19:43.400
 And that mini brain that we all have

1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:45.280
 is called your cerebellum.

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.040
 The cerebellum is called the mini brain

1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:48.320
 because it's in the back of your brain.

1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:49.520
 It looks like a little mini version

1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:50.920
 of the rest of your brain.

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:53.480
 It's an absolutely incredible structure

1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:54.920
 that's involved in movement.

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:58.280
 It also has a lot of non-movement associated functions.

1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:04.880
 In brief, the cerebellum gets input from your senses,

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:09.560
 particularly your eyes and pays attention

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:12.400
 to where your eyes are in space, what you're looking at.

1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:16.240
 It basically takes information about three aspects

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:18.780
 of your eyes and eye movements,

1:20:18.780 --> 1:20:23.280
 which are occurring when your head goes like this,

1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:24.880
 which is called pitch, okay?

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:26.400
 So this is pitch.

1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:27.400
 For those of you that are listening,

1:20:27.400 --> 1:20:30.380
 I'm just nodding up and down.

1:20:30.380 --> 1:20:33.120
 Then there's yaw, which is like shaking your head no

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:34.040
 from side to side.

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.520
 And then there's roll, which is like sometimes

1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:40.620
 if you see a primate, like a marmoset or something,

1:20:40.620 --> 1:20:42.680
 they will roll their head when they look at you.

1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:44.080
 Actually, the reason they do that

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:45.960
 is it helps generate depth perception.

1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:47.740
 It's a kind of form of motion parallax

1:20:47.740 --> 1:20:49.080
 if you're curious why they do that.

1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:50.560
 It's not to look cute.

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:52.440
 They do it because when they do that,

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:54.520
 even if you're stationary and they're stationary,

1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:56.220
 they get better depth perception

1:20:56.220 --> 1:20:59.880
 as to how far away from them you are.

1:20:59.880 --> 1:21:03.120
 So you've got pitch, yaw, and roll.

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:06.520
 And as you move your head and as you move your body

1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.080
 and you move through space,

1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:11.200
 the image on your retina moves, pitch, yaw, and roll,

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:12.160
 and some combination.

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:15.440
 That information is relayed to your cerebellum.

1:21:15.440 --> 1:21:17.780
 So it's rich with visual information.

1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:19.760
 There's also a map of your body surface

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:22.660
 and your movements and timing in the cerebellum.

1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:23.800
 So it's an incredible structure

1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:26.000
 that brings together timing of movements,

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:30.660
 which limbs are moving, and has proprioceptive information.

1:21:30.660 --> 1:21:32.000
 It really is a mini brain.

1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.760
 It's just the coolest little structure back there.

1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:36.400
 And in humans, it's actually not that little.

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:38.720
 It's just an incredible structure.

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:41.840
 Now, all this information is integrated there,

1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:44.740
 but what most people don't tell us

1:21:44.740 --> 1:21:47.920
 is that a lot of learning of motor sequences,

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:49.680
 of skill learning that involved timing

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:51.220
 occurs in the cerebellum.

1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:55.120
 Now, you can't really use that information

1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:57.600
 except to know that after you learn something pretty well,

1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:00.800
 it's handed off or kind of handled by your cerebellum.

1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:02.680
 But there is something that you can do with your cerebellum

1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:05.680
 to increase range of motion and flexibility.

1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:08.800
 Much of our flexibility, believe it or not,

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:12.440
 is not because our tendons are of particular length

1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:16.500
 or elasticity, although that plays some role.

1:22:16.500 --> 1:22:18.560
 It's not because our muscles are short.

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:20.000
 I don't know what that would even mean.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.120
 Some people have longer muscle bellies

1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:23.180
 or shorter muscle bellies,

1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:27.420
 but your muscles always essentially span the entire length

1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:30.640
 of the bone or limb or close to it,

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:32.480
 along with your tendons.

1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:36.900
 But it has to do with the neural innervation of muscle

1:22:36.900 --> 1:22:39.200
 and the fact that when muscles are elongated,

1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:41.920
 there's a point at which they won't stretch out

1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:45.860
 any longer and the nerves fire and they shut down.

1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:48.660
 You actually have inhibitory pathways

1:22:48.660 --> 1:22:50.480
 that prevent you from contracting the muscles

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:54.960
 or from extending them, from stretching them out anymore.

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:57.500
 So you can do this right now.

1:22:57.500 --> 1:22:59.000
 If you're driving, don't do it,

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:00.540
 because unless you have a self-driving car,

1:23:00.540 --> 1:23:02.160
 you'll need to take your hands off the steering wheel.

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:06.560
 But because of the way that vision

1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:11.560
 and your muscles are represented in your cerebellum,

1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:17.400
 it turns out that your range of visual motion

1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:19.160
 and your range of vision,

1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:23.760
 literally how wide a field of view you take,

1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:27.440
 impacts how far you can extend your limbs, okay?

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:30.440
 So we'll talk about this in a second,

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:33.560
 and about exactly how to do this and explore this.

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:37.900
 But as you move through space, as you walk forward,

1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:39.800
 or you walk backward, or you tilt your head,

1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:41.820
 or you learn a skill, or you just operate

1:23:41.820 --> 1:23:43.320
 in the normal ways throughout your day,

1:23:43.320 --> 1:23:45.240
 driving, biking, et cetera,

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:47.320
 your eyes are generating spontaneous movements

1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:49.520
 to offset visual slip.

1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.680
 In other words, you don't see the world as blurry

1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:53.000
 even though you're moving,

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.280
 because your eyes are generating

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:57.120
 little compensatory eye movements to offset your motion.

1:23:57.120 --> 1:23:59.360
 So if I spin, we could do this experiment.

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:02.240
 There's a fun experiment we do with medical students

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:04.540
 where you spin them around in a chair

1:24:04.540 --> 1:24:07.300
 with their eyes closed, and then you stop,

1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:08.400
 and you have them open their eyes,

1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:09.400
 and their eyes are going like this,

1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:11.380
 doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, nice stagmus.

1:24:11.380 --> 1:24:13.740
 I don't suggest you do this experiment.

1:24:13.740 --> 1:24:16.060
 When we were kids, we did a different experiment,

1:24:16.060 --> 1:24:17.800
 which was to take a stick,

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:19.280
 and to look at the top of the stick,

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:21.360
 and to spin around on the lawn,

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:22.400
 looking at the top of the stick,

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:24.320
 then put it down on the ground and try and jump over it,

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.680
 and you end up like jumping to the side,

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:27.420
 you miss the thing entirely.

1:24:27.420 --> 1:24:30.960
 The reason those two quote unquote experiments,

1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:34.660
 which I hope you don't do, or force somebody else to do,

1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:38.400
 the reason they work is because normally your eye movements

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:41.000
 and your balance and your limb movements are coordinated,

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.600
 but when you spin around looking up at the stick,

1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:45.300
 what you're doing is you're fixating your eyes

1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:47.480
 on one location while you're moving,

1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:48.980
 and then when you stop,

1:24:48.980 --> 1:24:50.920
 those two mechanisms are completely uncoupled,

1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:55.020
 and it's like being thrown into outer space.

1:24:55.020 --> 1:24:57.760
 Never been to outer space, but probably something like that,

1:24:57.760 --> 1:24:59.080
 low gravity, zero gravity.

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:02.840
 If you spin around in your chair with your eyes closed,

1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:05.040
 you're not giving the visual input that you're spinning,

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:06.680
 and then you open the eyes,

1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:09.560
 and then the eyes only have what we call

1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:10.400
 the vestibular signal,

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:12.040
 your eyes jolding back and forth, back and forth.

1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:13.940
 Again, these aren't experiments you need to do

1:25:13.940 --> 1:25:16.020
 because I just told you the result.

1:25:16.020 --> 1:25:19.940
 However, if you want to extend your range of motion,

1:25:19.940 --> 1:25:23.640
 you can do that by, these things always look goofy,

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:25.680
 but at this point, I'm just kind of used

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:26.600
 to doing these things.

1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:28.400
 If I want to extend my range of movement,

1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:31.000
 first I want to measure my range of motion.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:32.600
 So I'm trying to, if you're listening,

1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:34.500
 what I'm doing is I'm stretching out my arms

1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:37.520
 from like a T on either side,

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:40.320
 and I'm trying to push them as far back as I can,

1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:41.400
 which for me is, you know,

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:43.040
 feels like it's in line with my shoulders,

1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:44.000
 and I can't get much further.

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.760
 I'm not really super flexible,

1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.760
 nor am I particularly inflexible, at least physically.

1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:54.360
 So what I would then do is stop.

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.400
 I would move my eyes to the far periphery, right?

1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:59.500
 So I'm moving my eyes all the way to the left

1:25:59.500 --> 1:26:02.080
 while keeping my head and body stationary.

1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:05.760
 I'm trying to look over my left shoulder as far as I can,

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:07.880
 then off to the right.

1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:11.400
 It's a little awkward to do this, then up, then down,

1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:16.400
 but I'm mostly going to just focus on left and then right.

1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:19.500
 Now, what that's doing is it's sending a signal

1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:21.400
 to my cerebellum that my field of view

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:24.260
 is way over to there and way over to there.

1:26:24.260 --> 1:26:26.720
 Remember, your visual attention has an aperture.

1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.800
 It can be narrow or it can be broad.

1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:30.080
 And I've talked about some of the benefits

1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:31.640
 of taking a broad visual aperture

1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:33.400
 in order to relax the nervous system.

1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:35.680
 This is just moving my eyes, not my head,

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:37.840
 like I just did for a second, from side to side.

1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:40.140
 Now I can retest, and actually,

1:26:40.140 --> 1:26:43.160
 you get about a five to 15 degree increase

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:44.620
 in your range of motion.

1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:45.460
 Now I'm doing this for you.

1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:47.260
 You can say, well, you know, he gamed it

1:26:47.260 --> 1:26:49.540
 because he knew the result that he was hoping for,

1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:51.120
 but you can try this, okay?

1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:53.660
 And you can do this for legs too, right?

1:26:53.660 --> 1:26:55.400
 You can do this for any limb, essentially,

1:26:55.400 --> 1:26:57.400
 and it's purely cerebellar.

1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:01.280
 And it's because the proprioceptive visual

1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:04.720
 and limb movement feedback converge

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:08.360
 in the ways that we control our muscle spindles

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:10.720
 and the way we control the muscle fibers and the tendons.

1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:12.760
 And essentially, you can get bigger range of motion.

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:15.120
 So I actually will warm up before exercise

1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:17.720
 or before skill learning by both doing movements

1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.260
 for my body, but also moving my eyes from side to side

1:27:20.260 --> 1:27:22.420
 in order to generate larger range of motion,

1:27:22.420 --> 1:27:24.820
 if range of motion is something that I'm interested in.

1:27:24.820 --> 1:27:28.240
 So that's a fun one that you can play with a little bit.

1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:29.800
 And it's purely cerebellar.

1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:33.060
 Some other time we'll get back into a cerebellar function.

1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:35.480
 There's all sorts of just incredible stuff

1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:36.920
 that you can do with cerebellum.

1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:39.880
 I talked in an earlier episode on neuroplasticity

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:44.160
 about how you can disrupt your vestibular world.

1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:49.160
 In other words, by getting into modes of acceleration,

1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.480
 moving through space where you're tilted in certain ways,

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:54.920
 it can open up the windows for plasticity

1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.280
 and yet other ways.

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:58.000
 So you can check that out.

1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.220
 It's one of the earlier episodes on neuroplasticity

1:28:00.220 --> 1:28:01.560
 and everything's timestamped.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:04.320
 But meanwhile, if you want to expand your range of motion

1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:07.480
 before doing skill learning or afterward, this is a fun one.

1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:08.880
 It's also kind of neat

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:12.200
 because I have this kind of aversion to stretching work.

1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:14.160
 It never seems like something I want to do.

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:15.700
 And so I always put it off.

1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:18.920
 So if I start with the visual practice

1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:21.500
 of expanding my field of view off to one side

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.120
 or the other side or up or down,

1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:25.380
 then what I find is I'm naturally more flexible.

1:28:25.380 --> 1:28:26.720
 I'm not naturally more flexible.

1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:29.520
 What's happened is I've expanded my range of motion.

1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.220
 Let's talk about visualization and mental rehearsal.

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.640
 I've been asked about this a lot

1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:36.880
 and I think it relates back

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:40.300
 to that kind of a matrix Hollywood idea

1:28:40.300 --> 1:28:43.080
 that we can just be embedded with a skill.

1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:45.240
 Although in this case, in fairness,

1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:47.660
 visualization involves some work.

1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:50.260
 And I've talked about this on an earlier episode

1:28:50.260 --> 1:28:53.000
 that some people find it very hard

1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:56.100
 to mentally visualize things.

1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:57.760
 And some people find it very easy.

1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:00.600
 There was great work that was done in the 1960s

1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:04.920
 by Roger Shepard at Stanford and by others,

1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:06.660
 looking at people's ability

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:10.280
 to rotate three-dimensional objects in their mind.

1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:11.600
 And some people are really good at this

1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:12.960
 and some people are less good at this

1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:16.300
 and one can get better at it by repeating it.

1:29:16.300 --> 1:29:18.960
 But the question we're going to deal with today is,

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:19.960
 does it help?

1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:22.600
 Does it let you learn things faster?

1:29:22.600 --> 1:29:26.740
 And indeed the answer appears to be yes, it can.

1:29:26.740 --> 1:29:31.400
 However, despite what you've heard, it is not as good.

1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:33.800
 It is not a total replacement

1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:36.760
 for physical performance itself, okay?

1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:39.880
 So I'm going to be really concrete about this.

1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:44.880
 I hear all the time that just imagining contracting a muscle

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:46.440
 can lead to the same gains

1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:48.460
 as actually contracting that muscle.

1:29:48.460 --> 1:29:50.400
 Just imagining a skill can lead

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:52.680
 to the same increases in performance

1:29:52.680 --> 1:29:55.340
 as actually executing that skill.

1:29:55.340 --> 1:29:57.720
 And that's simply not the case.

1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:02.320
 However, it can supplement or support physical training

1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:05.360
 and skill learning in ways that are quite powerful.

1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:07.400
 One of the more interesting studies on this

1:30:07.400 --> 1:30:10.960
 was from Ranganathan et al.,

1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:12.840
 forgive me for the pronunciation.

1:30:14.280 --> 1:30:17.140
 This was a slightly older paper, 2004,

1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:19.280
 but nonetheless was one that I thought

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:21.240
 had particularly impressive results

1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:25.400
 and included all the appropriate controls, et cetera.

1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:28.000
 And what they did is they looked at 30 subjects

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.420
 and they divide them into different groups.

1:30:30.420 --> 1:30:34.440
 They had one group perform essentially finger flexion.

1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:35.640
 So it was actually just sort of the,

1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:37.080
 imagine if you're just listening to this,

1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:39.260
 the come here finger movement.

1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:42.840
 They also had elbow flexion,

1:30:42.840 --> 1:30:45.000
 so it's our bicep curl type movement.

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:48.120
 And they either had subjects do

1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:51.180
 a actual physical movement against resistance

1:30:51.180 --> 1:30:53.640
 or to imagine moving their finger

1:30:53.640 --> 1:30:55.980
 or their wrist towards the shoulder,

1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:57.960
 meaning at the bending at the elbow,

1:30:57.960 --> 1:30:59.760
 towards actual resistance.

1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:02.280
 Just to make a long story short,

1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:06.960
 what they found was that there were increases

1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:09.240
 in this finger adduction strength,

1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:12.880
 abduction, excuse me, strength of about 35%.

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:17.880
 And the elbow flexion strength by about 13.5%,

1:31:19.060 --> 1:31:21.000
 which are pretty impressive considering

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.300
 that it was just done mentally.

1:31:22.300 --> 1:31:25.360
 So they had people imagine moving against a weight,

1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:26.600
 a very heavy weight,

1:31:26.600 --> 1:31:30.440
 or had imagined people moving their wrist

1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:33.480
 towards their shoulder against a very heavy weight.

1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:34.760
 But again, they weren't doing it.

1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:36.560
 They were just imagining it.

1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:39.460
 Other experiments looked at the brain

1:31:39.460 --> 1:31:42.000
 and what was happening in the brain during this time.

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.080
 So we'll talk about that in a moment.

1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:47.840
 But essentially what they found were improvements

1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:52.840
 in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.

1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:56.480
 However, the actual physical training group,

1:31:56.480 --> 1:31:59.040
 the groups that actually moved their wrist

1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:02.540
 or move their finger against an actual physical weight

1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:05.280
 had improvements of about 53%.

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:08.960
 So this repeats over and over throughout the literature.

1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:13.120
 Mental rehearsal can cause increases in strength.

1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:18.120
 It can create increases in skill acquisition and learning,

1:32:18.340 --> 1:32:22.400
 but they are never as great if done alone

1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:26.880
 as compared to the actual physical execution

1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:28.680
 of those movements or the physical movement

1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:32.120
 of those weights, which shouldn't come as so surprising.

1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:34.400
 However, if we step back and we say, well,

1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:37.640
 what is the source of this improvement?

1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:39.280
 You might not care what the source is

1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:40.760
 because I could tell you it's one brain area

1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:42.640
 or another brain area, what difference would it make?

1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:45.400
 But again, if you can understand mechanism a little bit,

1:32:45.400 --> 1:32:47.920
 you're in a position to create newer

1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:49.920
 and even better protocols.

1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:54.260
 What mental rehearsal appears to do is engage the activity

1:32:54.260 --> 1:32:56.440
 of those upper motor neurons that we talked about

1:32:56.440 --> 1:32:58.760
 way back at the beginning of the episode.

1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:00.220
 Remember, you have upper motor neurons

1:33:00.220 --> 1:33:01.860
 that control deliberate action.

1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:03.960
 You've got lower motor neurons that actually connect

1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:05.400
 to the muscles and move those muscles

1:33:05.400 --> 1:33:07.320
 and you have central pattern generators.

1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:10.160
 Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically

1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:13.200
 and thinking about a particular sequence of movement

1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:18.200
 and visualizing it in one's quote unquote mind's eye

1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:21.320
 creates activation of the upper motor neurons

1:33:21.320 --> 1:33:25.720
 that's very similar if not the same as the actual movement.

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:28.000
 And that makes sense because the upper motor neurons

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.280
 are all about the command for movement.

1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:33.200
 They are not the ones that actually execute the movement.

1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:34.120
 Okay?

1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:35.960
 Remember, upper motor neurons are the ones

1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:37.580
 that generate the command for movement,

1:33:37.580 --> 1:33:38.960
 not the actual movement.

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:40.560
 The ones that generate the actual movement

1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:41.800
 are the lower motor neurons

1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:43.920
 and the central pattern generators.

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:46.520
 So visualization is a powerful tool.

1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:48.640
 How can you use visualization?

1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:52.680
 Well, in this study, they had people perform this

1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:54.720
 five days a week.

1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:59.560
 I believe that it was 15, yes, it was 15 minutes per day,

1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:01.680
 five days a week for 12 weeks.

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:03.920
 So that's a lot of mental rehearsal.

1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:05.680
 You know, it's not a ton of time each day,

1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:07.540
 15 minutes per day, but sitting down,

1:34:07.540 --> 1:34:09.380
 closing your eyes and imagining going through

1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:14.380
 a particular skill practice or moving a weight.

1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:18.200
 Maybe it's playing keys on a piano,

1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:21.480
 if that's your thing, or strings on a guitar.

1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:24.700
 For 15 minutes a day, five days per week for 12 weeks

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:25.560
 is considerable.

1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:29.700
 I think most people, given the fact that the actual practice,

1:34:29.700 --> 1:34:33.560
 the physical practice is going to lead to larger

1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:35.920
 improvements, greater improvements than would,

1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:37.880
 the mental training would opt

1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:40.000
 for the actual physical training.

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.800
 But of course, if you're on a plane

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:43.480
 and you don't have access to your guitar

1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:44.700
 and you're certainly not going to be sprinting

1:34:44.700 --> 1:34:45.980
 up and down the aisle,

1:34:45.980 --> 1:34:48.980
 or you are very serious about your craft

1:34:48.980 --> 1:34:52.300
 and you want to accelerate performance of your craft

1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:54.720
 or strength increases or something of that sort,

1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:58.680
 then augmenting or adding in the visualization training

1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.480
 very likely will compound the effects

1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.320
 of the actual physical training.

1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:06.440
 There are not a lot of studies looking at how visualization

1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:10.320
 on top of pure physical training

1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:13.540
 can increase the rates of learning

1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:16.160
 and consolidation of learning, et cetera.

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:17.600
 It's actually a hard study to do

1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:18.860
 because it's hard to control for,

1:35:18.860 --> 1:35:20.760
 because what would you do in its place?

1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:23.480
 You would probably add actual physical training

1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:26.480
 and then that's always going to lead to greater effects.

1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:30.280
 So the point is if you want to use visualization training,

1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:32.760
 great, but forget the idea

1:35:32.760 --> 1:35:36.020
 that visualization training is as good

1:35:36.020 --> 1:35:37.720
 as the actual behavior.

1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:38.720
 You hear this all the time.

1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:41.240
 People say, do you know that if you imagine an experience

1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:42.720
 to your brain and to your body,

1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:45.040
 it's exactly the same as the actual experience?

1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:46.080
 Absolutely not.

1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:47.660
 This is not the way the nervous system works.

1:35:47.660 --> 1:35:49.720
 I'm sorry, I don't mean to burst anybody's bubble,

1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:52.420
 but your bubble is made of myths.

1:35:52.420 --> 1:35:56.360
 And the fact of the matter is that the brain,

1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.560
 when it executes movement,

1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:01.120
 is generating proprioceptive feedback.

1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:04.420
 And that proprioceptive feedback is critically involved

1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:06.760
 in generating our sense of the experience

1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.640
 and in things like learning.

1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:12.780
 So I don't say this because I don't like the idea

1:36:12.780 --> 1:36:14.200
 that visualization couldn't work.

1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:16.080
 In fact, visualization does work,

1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:18.000
 but it doesn't work as well.

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.560
 It doesn't create the same milieu,

1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:21.680
 the same chemical milieu,

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:26.500
 the same environment as actual physically engaging

1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:29.080
 in the behavior, the skill, the resistance training,

1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:29.920
 et cetera.

1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:32.480
 And I'd be willing to wager that the same is true

1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:35.200
 for experiences of all kinds.

1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.000
 You know, PTSD is this incredibly unfortunate circumstance

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.640
 in which there's a replay often of the traumatic event

1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:45.480
 that feels very real,

1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:47.600
 but that's not to say that the replay itself

1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:50.000
 is the same as the actual event.

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.040
 And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.420
 with the utmost level of seriousness.

1:36:55.420 --> 1:36:57.000
 It should be treated.

1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.160
 In fact, my lab works on these sorts of things,

1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:03.560
 but my point about visualization and imagining something

1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:06.360
 not being the same as the actual experience

1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:08.960
 is grounded in this idea of proprioception

1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:11.040
 and the fact that feedback to the cerebellum,

1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:12.800
 the cerebellum talking to other areas of the brain

1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:14.920
 are critically involved in communicating

1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:16.380
 to the rest of our nervous system

1:37:16.380 --> 1:37:18.840
 that not just that we believe something is happening,

1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:20.500
 but something is actually happening.

1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:22.280
 And in the case of muscle loads,

1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:24.960
 muscles actually feeling tension,

1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:28.460
 the actual feeling of tension in the muscle,

1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:30.880
 the contracting of the muscle under that tension

1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:34.360
 is part of the important adaptation process.

1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:36.460
 In a future episode, we'll talk about hypertrophy

1:37:36.460 --> 1:37:38.600
 and how that works at the level of upper motor neurons,

1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:41.000
 lower motor neurons, and muscle itself.

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:44.040
 But for now, just know that visualization can work.

1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:46.060
 It doesn't work as well as real physical training

1:37:46.060 --> 1:37:49.120
 and practice, but these effects of, you know,

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:54.000
 35% or 13.5% increases are pretty considerable.

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.920
 They're just not as great as the 53% increases

1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:58.880
 that come from actual physical training.

1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:00.480
 For those of you that are interested

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:02.400
 in some of the skill learning

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:04.400
 that more relates to musical training,

1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:08.780
 but also how cadence and metronoming and tones, et cetera,

1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:11.560
 can support physical learning,

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:14.680
 if you're interested in that, if you're aficionados,

1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:16.660
 there is a wonderful review

1:38:16.660 --> 1:38:19.160
 also published in the journal Neuron,

1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:22.480
 again, excellent journal, by Herholtz and Zatorre,

1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:25.400
 that's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z,

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.880
 and Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E,

1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:33.520
 that really describes in detail

1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:36.280
 how musical training can impact

1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:40.320
 all sorts of different things and how cadence training,

1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:43.560
 whether or not with tones or auditory feedback

1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:44.480
 and things of that sort,

1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:48.680
 carries over to not just instrumental music training,

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:51.400
 but also physical skill learning of various kinds.

1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:53.720
 So if you want to do the deep dive, that would be the place.

1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:55.000
 You can find it easily online.

1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:56.960
 It's available as a complete article,

1:38:56.960 --> 1:38:58.740
 free of charge, et cetera.

1:38:58.740 --> 1:39:00.620
 Many of you are probably asking,

1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:03.840
 what can I take in order to accelerate skill learning?

1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:06.200
 Well, the conditions are going to vary,

1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:07.760
 but motivation is key.

1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:09.480
 You have to show up to the training session

1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.380
 motivated enough to focus your attention

1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:17.200
 and to perform a lot of repetitions in the training sequence.

1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:19.220
 That's just a prerequisite, right?

1:39:19.220 --> 1:39:20.480
 There's no pill that's going to allow you

1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:23.280
 to do fewer repetitions and extract more learning

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:24.440
 out of fewer repetitions.

1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:26.440
 It's actually more a question of,

1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:29.760
 what are the conditions that you can create for yourself

1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:32.580
 such that you can generate more repetitions per unit time?

1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:34.200
 I think that's the right way to think about it.

1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:36.960
 What are the conditions that you can create for yourself

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:38.160
 in your mind and in your body

1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:40.560
 that are going to allow you to focus?

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:43.600
 And I've talked about focus and plasticity and motivation

1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:44.560
 in previous episodes.

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:47.320
 Please see those episodes if you have questions about that.

1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:50.200
 I detail a lot of tools and the underlying science.

1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:52.400
 So for some people, it might be drinking a cup or two

1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:54.880
 of coffee and getting hydrated before the training session.

1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:56.760
 For some of you, it might be avoiding coffee

1:39:56.760 --> 1:39:57.880
 because it makes you too jittery

1:39:57.880 --> 1:39:59.560
 and your attention jumps all over the place.

1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:01.160
 It's going to vary tremendously.

1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:03.540
 There's no real, there is no magic pill

1:40:03.540 --> 1:40:06.220
 that's going to allow you to get more out of less.

1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:07.680
 That's just not going to happen.

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:09.120
 It's simply not going to happen.

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:10.540
 You're not going to get more learning

1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:12.920
 out of fewer repetitions or less time.

1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:15.840
 However, there are a few compounds

1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:18.920
 that I think are worth mentioning

1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:20.880
 because of their ability to improve

1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:22.600
 the actual physical performance,

1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:25.600
 the actual execution of certain types of movements.

1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.640
 And some of these have also been shown

1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:29.620
 to improve cognitive function,

1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:31.480
 especially in older populations.

1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:34.040
 So I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention them.

1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:36.600
 I'm only going to mention one today, in fact.

1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:38.260
 The one that's particularly interesting

1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:42.400
 and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha-GPC.

1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:45.800
 And I'm going to attempt to pronounce

1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:47.400
 what alpha-GPC actually is.

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:50.800
 It's alpha-glycerophosphocoline, right?

1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:53.920
 Alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerophosphocoline.

1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:55.840
 See, if I keep doing it over and over repetitions,

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:57.800
 alpha-glycerophosphocoline.

1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:58.720
 There, I made an error.

1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:02.440
 Okay, so the point is that alpha-GPC,

1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:04.060
 which is at least in the United States

1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:05.420
 is sold over the counter,

1:41:05.420 --> 1:41:10.420
 typically is taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams.

1:41:11.620 --> 1:41:13.960
 That's a single dose or have been shown

1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:15.200
 to do a number of things

1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:18.000
 that for some of you might be beneficial.

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:19.800
 One is to enhance power output.

1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:22.440
 So if you're engaging in something like shot put throwing

1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:25.420
 or resistance training or sprinting

1:41:25.420 --> 1:41:28.060
 or something where you have to generate a lot of power,

1:41:28.060 --> 1:41:29.480
 maybe you're doing rock climbing,

1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:31.720
 but you're working on a particular aspect

1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:33.840
 of your rock climbing that involves generating

1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:36.160
 a lot of force, a lot of power.

1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:40.640
 Well, then in theory, alpha-GPC could be beneficial to you.

1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:44.260
 For the cognitive effects, the dosages are much higher,

1:41:44.260 --> 1:41:47.960
 up to 1200 milligrams daily divided into three doses

1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:49.680
 of 400 milligrams is what the studies

1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:52.140
 that I was able to find show or used.

1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:54.040
 The effects on cognitive decline

1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:56.520
 are described as notable.

1:41:56.520 --> 1:41:59.540
 Notable meaning several studies showed a significant

1:41:59.540 --> 1:42:03.600
 but modest effect in offsetting cognitive decline,

1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.440
 in particular in older populations and some populations

1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.280
 even with some reported neurodegeneration.

1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:13.680
 Power output was notable.

1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:14.520
 How notable?

1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:15.920
 What does that mean, notable?

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:20.700
 A study noted a 14% increase in power output.

1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:25.500
 That's pretty substantial, 14% if you think about it,

1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:27.980
 but it wasn't like a doubling or something of that sort.

1:42:27.980 --> 1:42:29.860
 Believe it or not, the symptoms of Alzheimer's

1:42:29.860 --> 1:42:33.620
 have been shown at least among the nutraceuticals

1:42:33.620 --> 1:42:37.180
 of which alpha-GPC is to significantly improve cognition

1:42:37.180 --> 1:42:38.020
 in people with Alzheimer's.

1:42:38.020 --> 1:42:39.980
 Now, this episode isn't about cognitive decline

1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:41.960
 and longevity, we will talk about that,

1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:46.960
 but this is a so-called another effect of alpha-GPC.

1:42:47.620 --> 1:42:51.040
 Fat oxidation is increased by alpha-GPC,

1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:55.980
 growth hormone release is promoted by alpha-GPC,

1:42:55.980 --> 1:42:57.060
 although to a small degree.

1:42:57.060 --> 1:43:01.860
 So as you can see, things like alpha-GPC in particular,

1:43:01.860 --> 1:43:04.540
 when they are combined with low levels of caffeine

1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:07.200
 can have these effects of improving power output,

1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:09.260
 can improve growth hormone release,

1:43:09.260 --> 1:43:10.740
 can improve fat oxidation.

1:43:10.740 --> 1:43:14.860
 All these things in theory can support skill learning,

1:43:14.860 --> 1:43:16.300
 but what they're really doing

1:43:16.300 --> 1:43:17.920
 is they're adjusting the foundation

1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:19.780
 upon which you are going to execute

1:43:19.780 --> 1:43:22.020
 these many, many repetitions, okay?

1:43:22.020 --> 1:43:24.600
 The same thing would be said for caffeine itself.

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:26.180
 If that's something that motivates you

1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:27.080
 and gets you out of a chair

1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:28.540
 to actually do the physical training,

1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:32.400
 then that's something that can perhaps improve

1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:34.220
 or enhance the rate of skill learning

1:43:34.220 --> 1:43:36.780
 and how well you retain those skills.

1:43:36.780 --> 1:43:40.180
 Now, on a previous episode, I talked about,

1:43:40.180 --> 1:43:43.860
 and this was the episode on epinephrine, on adrenaline,

1:43:43.860 --> 1:43:47.540
 I talked about how for mental, for cognitive learning,

1:43:47.540 --> 1:43:50.840
 it makes sense to spike epinephrine,

1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:53.740
 to bump epinephrine levels up,

1:43:53.740 --> 1:43:57.020
 adrenaline levels up after cognitive learning.

1:43:57.020 --> 1:43:59.880
 For physical learning, it appears to be the opposite,

1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:02.660
 that if caffeine is in your practice

1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:05.200
 or if you decide to try alpha-GPC,

1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:07.420
 that you would want to do that before the training,

1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:09.500
 take it before the training, use it,

1:44:09.500 --> 1:44:11.620
 its effect should extend into the training,

1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:14.240
 presumably throughout, and then afterward,

1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:15.580
 if you're thinking about following

1:44:15.580 --> 1:44:17.420
 some of the protocols that we discussed today,

1:44:17.420 --> 1:44:20.300
 that you would use some sort of idle time

1:44:20.300 --> 1:44:23.540
 where the brain can replay these motor sequences in reverse,

1:44:23.540 --> 1:44:24.700
 and then, of course, you want to do things

1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:26.580
 that optimize your sleep.

1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:28.000
 A lot of the questions I get

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.020
 are about how different protocols

1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:31.100
 and things that I described

1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:32.700
 start to collide with one another.

1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:35.380
 So let's say, for instance, you go to bed at 1030

1:44:35.380 --> 1:44:39.780
 and you're going to do your skill training at 930,

1:44:39.780 --> 1:44:42.080
 well, taking a lot of caffeine then

1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:43.020
 is not going to be a good idea

1:44:43.020 --> 1:44:44.660
 because it's going to compromise your sleep.

1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:48.240
 So I'm not here to design the perfect schedule for you

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.420
 because everyone's situations vary.

1:44:50.420 --> 1:44:55.420
 So the things to optimize are repetitions, failures,

1:44:55.620 --> 1:44:58.740
 more repetitions, more failures,

1:44:58.740 --> 1:45:00.320
 at the offset of training,

1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:02.900
 having some idle time that could be straight into sleep,

1:45:02.900 --> 1:45:06.380
 or it could be simply letting the brain just go idle

1:45:06.380 --> 1:45:08.120
 for five to 10 minutes,

1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:09.340
 I mean, not focusing on anything,

1:45:09.340 --> 1:45:12.260
 not scrolling social media, not emailing,

1:45:12.260 --> 1:45:13.700
 ideally not even talking to somebody,

1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:16.260
 just lying down or sitting quietly with your eyes closed,

1:45:16.260 --> 1:45:18.780
 letting those motor sequences replay.

1:45:18.780 --> 1:45:21.860
 Then we talked about how one can come back

1:45:21.860 --> 1:45:23.740
 for additional training sessions,

1:45:23.740 --> 1:45:25.400
 use things like metronoming,

1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:29.140
 where you're cuing your attention to some external cue,

1:45:29.140 --> 1:45:31.460
 some stimulus, in this case, an auditory stimulus,

1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:33.260
 most likely, and trying to generate

1:45:33.260 --> 1:45:34.740
 more repetitions per unit time.

1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:37.860
 So again, it's repetitions and errors, that's key.

1:45:37.860 --> 1:45:40.540
 And then we also talked about some things that you can do

1:45:40.540 --> 1:45:42.740
 involving cerebellar neurophysiology

1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:44.220
 to extend range of motion,

1:45:44.220 --> 1:45:45.940
 if that's what's limiting for you,

1:45:45.940 --> 1:45:49.820
 or to use visualization to augment the practice,

1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:53.700
 or let's say your particular skill involves nice weather

1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:55.280
 and it's raining or snowing outside

1:45:55.280 --> 1:45:57.220
 and you can't get outside a thunderstorm,

1:45:57.220 --> 1:45:59.140
 then that's where visualization training

1:45:59.140 --> 1:46:01.980
 might be a good replacement under those conditions,

1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:04.480
 or in most cases, it's going to be the kind of thing

1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:05.420
 that you're going to want to do

1:46:05.420 --> 1:46:08.100
 in addition to the actual physical skill

1:46:08.100 --> 1:46:10.860
 or strength training session done,

1:46:10.860 --> 1:46:12.380
 at least in the study that we described,

1:46:12.380 --> 1:46:16.200
 for 15 minutes a day, five days a week,

1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:19.220
 over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.

1:46:19.220 --> 1:46:20.780
 So hopefully that makes it clear.

1:46:20.780 --> 1:46:23.340
 Today, we've covered a lot of mechanism.

1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:26.260
 We talked so much about the different motor pathways,

1:46:26.260 --> 1:46:27.460
 central pattern generators.

1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:31.540
 So you now are armed with a lot of information

1:46:31.540 --> 1:46:33.360
 about how you generate movement.

1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:35.720
 And I like to think that you're also armed

1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:38.900
 with a lot of information about how to design protocols

1:46:38.900 --> 1:46:40.280
 that are optimized for you,

1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:44.820
 or if you're a coach, for your trainees,

1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:48.260
 in order to optimize their learning of skills

1:46:48.260 --> 1:46:49.380
 of various kinds.

1:46:49.380 --> 1:46:53.040
 Today, we focused almost entirely on motor skills,

1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:55.700
 things like musical skills or physical skills.

1:46:55.700 --> 1:46:57.020
 These have some overlap.

1:46:57.020 --> 1:47:00.340
 They're partially overlapping with neuroplasticity

1:47:00.340 --> 1:47:03.540
 for learning things like languages or math or engineering

1:47:03.540 --> 1:47:05.180
 or neuroscience, for that matter.

1:47:06.580 --> 1:47:09.500
 Before we depart, I just want to make sure

1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:13.340
 that I return to a concept, which is the ultradian cycle.

1:47:13.340 --> 1:47:15.460
 Ultradian cycles are these 90-minute cycles

1:47:15.460 --> 1:47:17.200
 that we go through throughout sleep and wakefulness

1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:19.900
 that are optimal for learning and attention

1:47:19.900 --> 1:47:21.340
 in the waking state.

1:47:21.340 --> 1:47:24.780
 They are the stages of sleep

1:47:24.780 --> 1:47:26.060
 in which we have either predominantly

1:47:26.060 --> 1:47:27.900
 slow-wave sleep or REM sleep.

1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:29.760
 Some of you who have been following this podcast

1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:31.040
 for a while might be asking,

1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:35.300
 well, should a physical practice be 90 minutes?

1:47:35.300 --> 1:47:38.120
 That's going to depend because with physical practices,

1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:40.340
 oftentimes, for instance, with strength training,

1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:41.460
 that might be too long.

1:47:41.460 --> 1:47:43.980
 You're not going to be able to generate enough force output

1:47:43.980 --> 1:47:45.440
 for it to be worthwhile.

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:47.400
 For golfing, I don't know, I've never played golf,

1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:48.500
 although my friends that play golf,

1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:50.600
 they disappear under the golf course for many hours.

1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:53.660
 So I know there's a lot of walking and driving

1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:54.660
 and other stuff.

1:47:54.660 --> 1:47:58.500
 I even hear that somebody carries your stuff around for you.

1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:02.700
 Sometimes, not always, but it's going to differ.

1:48:02.700 --> 1:48:04.180
 A four-hour golf game,

1:48:04.180 --> 1:48:06.660
 you're probably not swinging the golf club for four hours.

1:48:06.660 --> 1:48:07.540
 So it's going to depend.

1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:09.940
 I would say that the ultradian cycle

1:48:09.940 --> 1:48:14.260
 is not necessarily a good constraint for skill learning

1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:15.480
 in most cases.

1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:17.220
 And I should say that for those of you

1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:20.300
 that are short on time or have limited amounts of time,

1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:23.100
 10 minutes of maximum repetitions, maximum focus,

1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:26.760
 skill learning work is going to be very beneficial.

1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:29.820
 Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard,

1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:32.180
 not really focused work,

1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:34.500
 or where you're not generating very many repetitions

1:48:34.500 --> 1:48:36.060
 because you're doing a few repetitions

1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:37.340
 and you're texting on your phone

1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:38.500
 or paying attention to something else,

1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:40.140
 that's not going to be beneficial.

1:48:40.140 --> 1:48:42.300
 It's really about the density of training

1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:43.180
 inside of a session.

1:48:43.180 --> 1:48:45.260
 So I think you should let the,

1:48:45.260 --> 1:48:49.100
 work toward maximal or near maximal density of repetitions

1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:50.980
 and failures, provided they're failures

1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:52.960
 you can perform safely.

1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:54.540
 In order to accelerate skill learning

1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:56.780
 and don't let some arbitrary,

1:48:56.780 --> 1:48:59.520
 or in this case the ultradian constraint

1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:01.320
 prevent you from engaging in that practice.

1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:02.660
 In other words, get the work in,

1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:05.180
 get as much work done as you can per unit time.

1:49:05.180 --> 1:49:06.780
 And based on the science,

1:49:06.780 --> 1:49:08.200
 based on things that I've seen,

1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:10.260
 based on things that I'm now involved in

1:49:10.260 --> 1:49:11.480
 with various communities,

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:16.480
 you will see the skill improve vastly at various stages.

1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:18.140
 Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start.

1:49:18.140 --> 1:49:20.780
 It's not always a linear improvement,

1:49:20.780 --> 1:49:23.560
 but you will see incredible improvement in skill.

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:25.020

 The sponsors that we mentioned

1:50:10.740 --> 1:50:12.860
 at the beginning of each podcast episode

1:50:12.860 --> 1:50:15.820
 are really important in order to support our production team

1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:17.940
 and as well, we have a Patreon.

1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:20.700
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:23.580
 There you can support us at any level that you like.

1:50:23.580 --> 1:50:25.660
 In previous episodes and in this episode,

1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:27.280
 I mentioned some supplements.

1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:31.240
 Supplements certainly have their place for various things.

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:33.780
 They aren't necessary, but many people, including myself,

1:50:33.780 --> 1:50:35.620
 derive benefit from supplements

1:50:35.620 --> 1:50:37.340
 for things like improving sleep

1:50:37.340 --> 1:50:40.540
 and immune system function and learning and so forth.

1:50:40.540 --> 1:50:42.740
 If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,

1:50:42.740 --> 1:50:46.100
 you can go to thorn.com slash you,

1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:48.460
 that's the letter U slash Huberman

1:50:48.460 --> 1:50:50.720
 and you can see the supplements that I take.

1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:52.280
 If you want to try any of those supplements,

1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:56.660
 you can get 20% off simply by accessing the Thorne webpage

1:50:56.660 --> 1:50:59.060
 through that portal, as well as 20% off

1:50:59.060 --> 1:51:01.540
 any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:03.020
 The reason we've partnered with Thorne

1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:05.900
 is because Thorne has the very highest levels of stringency

1:51:05.900 --> 1:51:08.540
 in terms of the quality of the supplements

1:51:08.540 --> 1:51:11.660
 and the accuracy about the amounts of each supplement

1:51:11.660 --> 1:51:12.480
 that are in the bottle.

1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:14.940
 One of the major problems in the supplement industry

1:51:14.940 --> 1:51:18.700
 is that when supplements get tested, often it's the case

1:51:18.700 --> 1:51:22.620
 that the amount of a given ingredient is far lower

1:51:22.620 --> 1:51:25.300
 or far greater than what's reported on the bottle.

1:51:25.300 --> 1:51:26.800
 That's not the case for Thorne.

1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:29.760
 Thorne has very high levels of stringency.

1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.280
 They partnered with the Mayo Clinic

1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:32.720
 and all the major sports teams

1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:34.720
 and that's why we've partnered with them as well.

1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:35.900
 So if you want to check those out,

1:51:35.900 --> 1:51:40.260
 again, it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E slash the letter U

1:51:40.260 --> 1:51:42.340
 slash Huberman to get 20% off

1:51:42.340 --> 1:51:45.100
 any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:46.360
 And last but not least,

1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:48.620
 I want to thank you for your time and attention.

1:51:48.620 --> 1:51:51.180
 I very much appreciate your interest in neuroscience

1:51:51.180 --> 1:51:54.140
 and in physiology and in tools that are informed

1:51:54.140 --> 1:51:56.160
 by neuroscience and physiology.

1:51:56.160 --> 1:51:58.820
 Today, we talked all about skill learning.

1:51:58.820 --> 1:52:00.980
 I hope that you'll consider the information.

1:52:00.980 --> 1:52:02.780
 You might even decide to try some of these tools.

1:52:02.780 --> 1:52:05.380
 If you do, please let us know your results with them.

1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:07.060
 Give us feedback in the comments.

1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:09.780
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:52:09.780 --> 1:52:14.780
 We'll see you next time.
