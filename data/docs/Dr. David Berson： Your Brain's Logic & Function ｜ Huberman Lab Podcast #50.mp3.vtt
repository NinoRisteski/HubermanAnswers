00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.240
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.240 --> 00:13.020
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.020 --> 00:14.920
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.160
 Today, my guest is Dr. David Berson,

00:17.160 --> 00:19.480
 professor of medical science, neurobiology,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.240
 and ophthalmology at Brown University.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.020
 Dr. Berson's laboratory is credited

00:24.020 --> 00:25.960
 with discovering the cells in the eye

00:25.960 --> 00:28.180
 that set your circadian rhythms.

00:28.180 --> 00:30.080
 These are the so-called intrinsically

00:30.080 --> 00:32.020
 photosensitive melanopsin cells,

00:32.020 --> 00:33.720
 and while that's a mouthful,

00:33.720 --> 00:36.140
 all you need to know for sake of this introduction

00:36.140 --> 00:38.760
 is that those are the cells that inform your brain and body

00:38.760 --> 00:40.560
 about the time of day.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.480
 Dr. Berson's laboratory has also made

00:42.480 --> 00:44.240
 a number of other important discoveries

00:44.240 --> 00:47.880
 about how we convert our perceptions of the outside world

00:47.880 --> 00:50.080
 into motor action.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.240
 More personally, Dr. Berson has been my go-to resource

00:53.240 --> 00:57.160
 for all things neuroscience for nearly two decades.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.180
 I knew of his reputation as a spectacular researcher

01:00.180 --> 01:01.680
 for a long period of time,

01:01.680 --> 01:05.080
 and then many years ago, I cold-called him out of the blue.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.220
 I basically corralled him into a long conversation

01:08.220 --> 01:10.920
 over the phone, after which he invited me out to Brown,

01:10.920 --> 01:13.040
 and we've been discussing neuroscience

01:13.040 --> 01:16.720
 and how the brain works and the emerging new technologies

01:16.720 --> 01:19.440
 and the emerging new concepts in neuroscience

01:19.440 --> 01:22.020
 for a very long time now.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.080
 You're going to realize today

01:23.080 --> 01:25.600
 why Dr. Berson is my go-to source.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.260
 He has an exceptionally clear and organized view

01:29.260 --> 01:31.360
 of how the nervous system works.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.520
 Now, there are many, many parts of the nervous system,

01:33.520 --> 01:36.420
 different nuclei and connections and circuits and chemicals

01:36.420 --> 01:39.180
 and so forth, but it takes a special kind of person

01:39.180 --> 01:41.240
 to be able to organize that information

01:41.240 --> 01:43.860
 into a structured and logical framework

01:43.860 --> 01:46.980
 that can allow us to make sense of how we function

01:46.980 --> 01:49.140
 in terms of what we feel, what we experience,

01:49.140 --> 01:51.020
 how we move through the world.

01:51.020 --> 01:53.080
 Dr. Berson is truly one of a kind

01:53.080 --> 01:55.600
 in his ability to synthesize and organize

01:55.600 --> 01:57.360
 and communicate that information.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.120
 And I give him credit as one of my mentors

02:00.120 --> 02:02.260
 and one of the people that I respect most

02:02.260 --> 02:05.220
 in the field of science and medical science generally.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.560
 Today, Dr. Berson takes us on a journey

02:07.560 --> 02:09.320
 from the periphery of the nervous system,

02:09.320 --> 02:12.720
 meaning from the outside, deep into the nervous system,

02:12.720 --> 02:16.660
 layer by layer, structure by structure, circuit by circuit,

02:16.660 --> 02:19.540
 making clear to us how each of these individual circuits

02:19.540 --> 02:22.440
 work and how they work together as a whole.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.480
 It's a really magnificent description

02:24.480 --> 02:27.440
 that you simply cannot get from any textbook,

02:27.440 --> 02:30.280
 from any popular book, and frankly, as far as I know,

02:30.280 --> 02:33.120
 from any podcast that currently exists out there.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.880
 So it's a real gift to have this opportunity

02:34.880 --> 02:36.540
 to learn from Dr. Berson.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.340
 Again, I consider him my mentor in the field

02:39.340 --> 02:41.440
 of learning and teaching neuroscience,

02:41.440 --> 02:43.760
 and I'm excited for you to learn from him.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.680
 One thing is for certain, by the end of this podcast,

02:46.680 --> 02:49.560
 you will know far more about how your nervous system works

02:49.560 --> 02:51.620
 than the vast majority of people out there,

02:51.620 --> 02:55.320
 including many expert biologists and neuroscientists.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.000
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:58.000 --> 03:00.960
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.880
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:02.880 --> 03:05.480
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:05.480 --> 03:08.200
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.240
 In keeping with that theme,

03:09.240 --> 03:12.000
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.260
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.860
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:15.860 --> 03:18.280
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.500
 I've been taking Athletic Greens every day since 2012,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.920
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.720
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

03:25.720 --> 03:27.660
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

03:27.660 --> 03:29.720
 is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral

03:29.720 --> 03:31.480
 and probiotic needs.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.560
 Nowadays, there's a lot of data out there

03:33.560 --> 03:36.240
 pointing to the fact that a healthy gut microbiome,

03:36.240 --> 03:38.280
 literally little microbes that live in our gut

03:38.280 --> 03:40.720
 that are good for us, is important to support

03:40.720 --> 03:43.640
 our immune system, our nervous system, our endocrine system,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.920
 and various aspects of our immediate and long-term health.

03:46.920 --> 03:47.760
 With Athletic Greens,

03:47.760 --> 03:49.800
 I get all the vitamins and minerals that I need,

03:49.800 --> 03:53.520
 plus the probiotics ensure a healthy gut microbiome.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.640
 It also tastes really good.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.900
 I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.240
 I'll have that early in the day

03:58.240 --> 04:00.720
 and sometimes a second time later in the day as well.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.600
 It's compatible with intermittent fasting.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.960
 It's compatible with vegan diets, with keto diets,

04:05.960 --> 04:07.120
 and essentially every diet

04:07.120 --> 04:09.840
 that you could possibly imagine out there.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.180
 It's also filled with adaptogens for recovery.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.040
 It has digestive enzymes for gut health

04:14.040 --> 04:15.120
 and has a number of other things

04:15.120 --> 04:16.640
 that support the immune system.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.900
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

04:18.900 --> 04:21.440
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:21.440 --> 04:22.960
 to claim their special offer.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.440
 They'll give you five free travel packs

04:24.440 --> 04:26.320
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

04:26.320 --> 04:27.440
 while you're on the road,

04:27.440 --> 04:30.960
 and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.800
 There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin D3

04:33.800 --> 04:37.520
 supports a huge number of metabolic factors,

04:37.520 --> 04:39.640
 immune system factors, endocrine factors.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.360
 Basically, we need vitamin D3.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.680
 We can get it from the sun,

04:42.680 --> 04:45.200
 but many people are deficient in vitamin D3

04:45.200 --> 04:47.080
 even if they are getting what they think

04:47.080 --> 04:48.320
 is sufficient sunlight.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.720
 And K2 is important for cardiovascular health.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.600
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.140
 you can claim their special offer,

04:55.140 --> 04:56.320
 the five free travel packs,

04:56.320 --> 04:59.160
 plus the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.360
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.840
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

05:04.840 --> 05:07.280
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

05:07.280 --> 05:08.820
 to help you better understand your body

05:08.820 --> 05:10.720
 and help you reach your health goals.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.640
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

05:13.640 --> 05:16.240
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

05:16.240 --> 05:18.540
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

05:18.540 --> 05:21.120
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.600
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

05:23.600 --> 05:26.180
 you can also get information about how your specific genes

05:26.180 --> 05:28.740
 are impacting your immediate and long-term health.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.240
 Now, a problem with a lot of blood tests

05:30.240 --> 05:32.680
 and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back,

05:32.680 --> 05:34.720
 but you don't know what to do with those numbers.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.400
 With InsideTracker, they make it very simple

05:37.400 --> 05:39.620
 to figure out what to do to bring those numbers

05:39.620 --> 05:41.560
 into the ranges that are right for you.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.300
 They have a dashboard that's very easy to use.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.800
 You can see the numbers from your blood and or DNA tests,

05:47.800 --> 05:50.420
 and it will point to specific lifestyle factors,

05:50.420 --> 05:53.280
 nutritional factors, as well as supplementation,

05:53.280 --> 05:55.920
 maybe even prescription factors that would be right for you

05:55.920 --> 05:57.960
 to bring the numbers into range that are ideal

05:57.960 --> 06:00.360
 for your immediate and long-term health goals.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.040
 Another feature that InsideTracker has

06:02.040 --> 06:03.920
 is their inner age test.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.200
 This test shows you what your biological age is

06:06.200 --> 06:08.520
 and compares that to your chronological age

06:08.520 --> 06:11.220
 and what you can do to improve your biological age,

06:11.220 --> 06:13.100
 which of course is the important number.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.460
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

06:14.460 --> 06:17.080
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

06:17.080 --> 06:20.040
 to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.360
 Also, an interview I did with longevity research doctor

06:23.360 --> 06:25.840
 and InsideTracker's founder, Dr. Gil Blander,

06:25.840 --> 06:27.560
 is out now on their podcast,

06:27.560 --> 06:29.560
 the Longevity by Design podcast,

06:29.560 --> 06:31.360
 and a link to that interview can be found

06:31.360 --> 06:32.800
 in today's show notes.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.920
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.720
 Magic Spoon is a zero-sugar,

06:37.720 --> 06:40.140
 grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.

06:40.140 --> 06:41.880
 I don't follow a ketogenic diet.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.120
 The way that I eat is basically geared toward

06:44.120 --> 06:46.080
 feeling alert when I want to be alert

06:46.080 --> 06:48.000
 and feeling sleepy when I want to go to sleep,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.600
 which for me means fasting until about 11 a.m. or noon,

06:50.600 --> 06:51.720
 most days.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.920
 Then I eat low-carb during the day.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.560
 So I'll have some meat or fish or chicken and some salad.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.480
 That's what works for me.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.320
 And in the afternoon,

06:58.320 --> 07:00.920
 I remain on a more or less low-carb-ish diet.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.160
 And then in the evening,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.960
 I eat pastas and things primarily,

07:03.960 --> 07:05.400
 and I throttle back on the protein,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.140
 and that's what allows me to fall asleep at night.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.680
 That's just what works for me.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.740
 So if I want a snack in the afternoon,

07:10.740 --> 07:14.080
 I want that to be a ketogenic or low-carb snack.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.820
 And that snack these days is Magic Spoon.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.160
 Magic Spoon is really terrific.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.120
 It has zero grams of sugar, 13 to 14 grams of protein,

07:21.120 --> 07:24.200
 and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.120
 It's really delicious.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.200
 They have a number of different flavors like cocoa,

07:27.200 --> 07:29.280
 fruity, peanut butter, and frosted.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.720
 I particularly like frosted.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.240
 It tastes like donuts, and I really like donuts,

07:33.240 --> 07:36.540
 although I try not to eat donuts too often, if ever.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.560
 What I do lately is I take Magic Spoon,

07:38.560 --> 07:40.960
 I put it in some Bulgarian yogurt, which is really good,

07:40.960 --> 07:41.840
 and I mix that up.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.680
 I put those in there,

07:42.680 --> 07:43.980
 and sometimes I put some cinnamon on them,

07:43.980 --> 07:44.840
 and as I'm describing this,

07:44.840 --> 07:46.160
 I'm getting hungry for Magic Spoon.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.960
 So if you want to try Magic Spoon,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.920
 you can go to magicspoon.com slash Huberman

07:50.920 --> 07:52.160
 to get their variety pack.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.600

07:58.960 --> 08:01.760
 and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

08:01.760 --> 08:05.160
 And now for my discussion with Dr. David Berson.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.000
 Welcome.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.640
 Thank you, yeah, so nice to be here.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.880
 Great to have you for more than 20 years.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.260
 You've been my go-to source for all things,

08:14.260 --> 08:17.120
 nervous system, how it works, how it's structured.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.120
 So today I want to ask you some questions about that.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.880
 I think people would gain a lot of insight

08:22.880 --> 08:24.940
 into this machine that makes them think,

08:24.940 --> 08:27.180
 and feel, and see, et cetera.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.760
 If you would, could you tell us how we see?

08:31.760 --> 08:36.760
 You know, a photon of light enters the eye, what happens?

08:37.480 --> 08:38.320
 Right.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.020
 I mean, how is it that I look outside,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.200
 I see a truck drive by, or I look on the wall,

08:42.200 --> 08:46.320
 I see a photo of my dog, how does that work?

08:46.320 --> 08:49.120
 Right, so this is an old question, obviously.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.880
 And clearly in the end,

08:50.880 --> 08:52.780
 the reason you have a visual experience

08:52.780 --> 08:56.120
 is that your brain has got some pattern of activity

08:56.120 --> 08:59.100
 that it associates with the input from the periphery.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.760
 But you can have a visual experience

09:00.760 --> 09:02.600
 with no input from the periphery as well.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.040
 When you're dreaming, you're seeing things

09:06.040 --> 09:07.480
 that aren't coming through your eyes.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.540
 Are those memories?

09:09.560 --> 09:10.740
 I would say in a sense,

09:10.740 --> 09:13.180
 they may reflect your visual experience.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.160
 They're not necessarily specific visual memories,

09:15.160 --> 09:16.760
 but of course they can be.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.920
 But the point is that the experience of seeing

09:18.920 --> 09:21.420
 is actually a brain phenomenon.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.560
 But of course, under normal circumstances,

09:24.560 --> 09:26.500
 we see the world because we're looking at it,

09:26.500 --> 09:28.560
 and we're using our eyes to look at it.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.280
 And fundamentally, when we're looking at the exterior world,

09:32.280 --> 09:35.060
 it's what the retina is telling the brain that matters.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.900
 So there are cells called ganglion cells.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.520
 These are neurons that are the key cells

09:40.520 --> 09:43.140
 for communicating between eye and brain.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.460
 The eye is like the camera.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.460
 It's detecting the initial image,

09:46.460 --> 09:47.700
 doing some initial processing,

09:47.700 --> 09:51.520
 and then that signal gets sent back to the brain proper.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.360
 And of course, it's there at the level of the cortex

09:54.360 --> 09:56.240
 that we have this conscious visual experience.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.760
 There are many other places in the brain

09:57.760 --> 09:59.740
 that get visual input as well,

09:59.740 --> 10:02.740
 doing other things with that kind of information.

10:02.740 --> 10:05.980
 So I get a lot of questions about color vision.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.060
 If you would, could you explain how is it

10:09.060 --> 10:12.320
 that we can perceive reds and greens and blues

10:12.320 --> 10:13.460
 and things of that sort?

10:13.460 --> 10:14.300
 Right.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.380
 So the first thing to understand about light

10:16.380 --> 10:19.900
 is that it's just a form of electromagnetic radiation.

10:20.940 --> 10:23.400
 It's vibrating, it's oscillating.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.540
 But when you say it's vibrating, it's oscillating,

10:25.540 --> 10:28.500
 you mean that photons are actually moving?

10:28.500 --> 10:29.860
 Well, in a sense, photons are,

10:29.860 --> 10:31.880
 they're certainly moving through space.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.460
 We think about photons as particles,

10:34.460 --> 10:36.060
 and that's one way of thinking about light,

10:36.060 --> 10:39.240
 but we can also think of it as a wave, like a radio wave.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.900
 Either way is acceptable.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.580
 And the radio waves have frequencies,

10:42.580 --> 10:45.300
 like the frequencies on your radio dial.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.420
 And certain frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum

10:48.420 --> 10:51.000
 can be detected by neurons in the retina.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.980
 Those are the things we see.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.660
 But there are still different wavelengths

10:54.660 --> 10:57.820
 within the light that can be seen by the eye.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.540
 And those different wavelengths are unpacked in a sense,

11:00.540 --> 11:03.560
 or decoded by the nervous system

11:03.560 --> 11:06.460
 to lead to our experience of color.

11:07.540 --> 11:10.500
 Essentially, different wavelengths give us the sensation

11:10.500 --> 11:13.700
 of different colors through the auspices

11:13.700 --> 11:15.900
 of different neurons that are tuned

11:15.900 --> 11:17.700
 to different wavelengths of light.

11:17.700 --> 11:22.380
 So when a photon, so when a little bit of light hits my eye,

11:22.380 --> 11:25.140
 it goes in, the photoreceptors convert

11:25.140 --> 11:26.500
 that into electrical signal.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.320
 Right.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.700
 How is it that a given photon of light

11:30.700 --> 11:33.160
 gives me the perception, eventually leads to the perception

11:33.160 --> 11:35.180
 of red versus green versus blue?

11:35.180 --> 11:36.020
 Right.

11:36.020 --> 11:40.660
 So if you imagine that in the first layer of the retina,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.300
 where this transformation occurs

11:42.300 --> 11:45.180
 from electromagnetic radiation into neural signals,

11:46.540 --> 11:49.740
 that you have different kinds of sensitive cells

11:49.740 --> 11:54.020
 that are expressing, they're making different molecules

11:54.020 --> 11:56.480
 within themselves for this express purpose

11:56.480 --> 11:59.360
 of absorbing photons, which is the first step

11:59.360 --> 12:01.340
 in the process of seeing.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.900
 Now, it turns out that altogether,

12:03.900 --> 12:06.700
 there are about five proteins like this

12:06.700 --> 12:09.700
 that we need to think about in the typical retina.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.900
 But for seeing color, really, it's three of them.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.340
 So there are three different proteins.

12:13.340 --> 12:17.580
 Each absorbs light with a different preferred frequency.

12:17.580 --> 12:20.640
 And then the nervous system keeps track of those signals,

12:22.660 --> 12:25.740
 compares and contrasts them to extract some understanding

12:25.740 --> 12:28.120
 of the wavelength composition of light.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.660
 So you can see just by looking at a landscape,

12:30.660 --> 12:33.380
 oh, it must be late in the day

12:33.380 --> 12:34.980
 because things are looking golden.

12:34.980 --> 12:38.580
 That's all a function of our absorbing the light

12:38.580 --> 12:39.940
 that's coming from the world

12:39.940 --> 12:41.700
 and interpreting that with our brain

12:41.700 --> 12:43.100
 because of the different composition

12:43.100 --> 12:46.020
 of the light that's reaching our eyes.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.200
 Is it fair to assume that my perception of red

12:48.200 --> 12:50.220
 is the same as your perception of red?

12:50.220 --> 12:51.380
 Well, that's a great question.

12:51.380 --> 12:52.580
 And that mine is better.

12:52.580 --> 12:55.260
 No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.100
 It's a great question.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.460
 It's a deep philosophical question.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.780
 It's a question that really probably can't even

12:59.780 --> 13:01.140
 ultimately be answered

13:02.440 --> 13:05.180
 by the usual empirical scientific processes

13:05.180 --> 13:08.420
 because it's really about an individual's experience.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.340
 What we can say is that the biological mechanisms

13:14.340 --> 13:17.420
 that we think are important for seeing color, for example,

13:17.420 --> 13:19.500
 seem to be very highly similar

13:19.500 --> 13:20.980
 from one individual to the next,

13:20.980 --> 13:23.180
 whether it be human beings or other animals.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.500
 And so we think that the physiological process

13:27.500 --> 13:29.780
 looks very similar on the front end,

13:29.780 --> 13:32.220
 but once you're at the level of perception

13:32.220 --> 13:34.940
 or understanding or experience,

13:34.940 --> 13:38.500
 that's something that's a little bit tougher to nail down

13:38.500 --> 13:42.560
 with the sorts of scientific approaches

13:42.560 --> 13:46.100
 that we approach, biological vision, let's say.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.060
 You mentioned that there are five different cone types,

13:49.060 --> 13:50.860
 essentially, the cones being the cells

13:50.860 --> 13:53.820
 that absorb light of different wavelengths.

13:53.820 --> 13:57.460
 I often wondered when I had my dog,

13:57.460 --> 14:01.940
 what he saw and how his vision differs from our vision.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.220
 And certainly there are animals that can see things

14:04.220 --> 14:05.620
 that we can't see.

14:05.620 --> 14:09.140
 What are some of the more outrageous examples of that?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.960
 Of seeing things that we can't?

14:10.960 --> 14:13.540
 And in the extreme, you know,

14:13.540 --> 14:17.580
 dogs, I'm guessing, see reds more as oranges, is that right?

14:17.580 --> 14:21.340
 Because they don't have the same array of neurons

14:21.340 --> 14:22.900
 that we have for seeing color.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.460
 Right, so the first thing is

14:24.460 --> 14:26.980
 it's not really five types of cones.

14:26.980 --> 14:29.020
 There are really three types of cones.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.300
 And if you look at the way

14:30.300 --> 14:31.900
 that color vision is thought to work,

14:31.900 --> 14:32.740
 you can sort of see

14:32.740 --> 14:35.120
 that it has to be three different signals.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.300
 There are a couple of other types of pigments.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.660
 One is really mostly for dim light vision.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.780
 When you're walking around in a moonless night

14:42.780 --> 14:45.740
 and you're seeing things with very low light,

14:45.740 --> 14:49.220
 that's the rod cell that uses its own pigment.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.380
 And then there's another class of pigments

14:51.380 --> 14:52.960
 we'll probably talk about a little bit later,

14:52.960 --> 14:54.380
 this melanopsin pigment.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.260
 I thought you were referring to like ultraviolet

14:56.260 --> 14:58.500
 and infrared and things of that sort.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.660
 Right, so in the case of a typical,

15:01.660 --> 15:04.300
 well, let's put it this way, in human beings,

15:04.300 --> 15:06.540
 most of us have three cone types

15:06.540 --> 15:10.860
 and we can see colors that stem from that.

15:10.860 --> 15:15.860
 In most mammals, including your dog or your cat,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.540
 there really are only two cone types

15:18.540 --> 15:21.860
 and that limits the kind of vision that they can have

15:21.860 --> 15:25.080
 in the domain of wavelength or color, as you would say.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.940
 So really a dog sees the world

15:26.940 --> 15:30.460
 kind of like a particular kind of colorblind human

15:30.460 --> 15:31.740
 might see the world,

15:31.740 --> 15:33.300
 because instead of having three channels

15:33.300 --> 15:35.740
 to compare and contrast, they only have two channels

15:35.740 --> 15:37.020
 and that makes it much more difficult

15:37.020 --> 15:40.100
 to figure out exactly which wavelength you're looking at.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.300
 Do colorblind people suffer much

15:42.300 --> 15:44.420
 as a consequence of being colorblind?

15:44.420 --> 15:47.380
 Well, you know, it's like so many other disabilities,

15:47.380 --> 15:52.380
 we are, you know, the world is built for people

15:52.580 --> 15:54.820
 of the most common type.

15:54.820 --> 15:59.620
 So in some cases, the expectation can be there

15:59.620 --> 16:01.960
 that somebody can see something that they won't be able to

16:01.960 --> 16:04.420
 if they're missing one of their cone types, let's say.

16:04.420 --> 16:08.460
 So in those moments, that can be a real problem.

16:08.460 --> 16:11.220
 You know, if there's a lack of contrast

16:11.220 --> 16:13.980
 to their visual system, they will be blind to that.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.740
 In general, it's a fairly modest

16:16.740 --> 16:20.380
 visual limitation as things go.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.980
 You know, for example, if not being able to see acutely

16:22.980 --> 16:24.140
 can be much more damaging,

16:24.140 --> 16:26.860
 not being able to read fine print, for example.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.660
 Yeah, I suppose if I had to give up

16:29.980 --> 16:31.620
 the ability to see certain colors

16:31.620 --> 16:33.340
 or give up the ability to see clearly,

16:33.340 --> 16:37.480
 I'd certainly trade out color for clarity.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.540
 Right, of course, color is very meaningful

16:39.540 --> 16:41.620
 to us as human beings, you know?

16:41.620 --> 16:43.880
 So we would hate to give it up,

16:43.880 --> 16:46.540
 but obviously dogs and cats and all kinds of other mammals

16:46.540 --> 16:48.060
 do perfectly well in the world.

16:48.060 --> 16:49.240
 Yeah, because we take care of them.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.620
 I spent most of my time taking care of that dog.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.260
 He took care of me too.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.880
 Let's talk about that odd photo pigment.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.700
 Photo pigment, of course, being the thing

17:02.700 --> 17:05.060
 that absorbs light of a particular wavelength.

17:05.060 --> 17:09.060
 And let's talk about these specialized ganglion cells

17:09.940 --> 17:12.380
 that communicate certain types of information

17:12.380 --> 17:13.820
 from eye to the brain

17:13.820 --> 17:16.660
 that are so important for so many things.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.960
 What I'm referring to here, of course,

17:17.960 --> 17:20.100
 is your co-discovery of the so-called

17:20.100 --> 17:22.260
 intrinsically photosensitive cells,

17:22.260 --> 17:25.020
 the neurons in the eye that do so many of the things

17:25.020 --> 17:27.540
 that don't actually have to do with perception,

17:27.540 --> 17:30.260
 but have to do with important biological functions.

17:30.260 --> 17:31.180
 What I would love for you to do

17:31.180 --> 17:35.060
 is explain to me why once I heard you say

17:35.060 --> 17:38.860
 we have a bit of fly eye in our eye.

17:38.860 --> 17:42.180
 And you showed this slide of like a giant fly

17:42.180 --> 17:46.220
 from a horror movie trying to attack this woman.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.560
 And maybe it was an eye also.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.040
 So what does it mean that we have a bit of a fly eye

17:52.040 --> 17:53.100
 in our eye?

17:53.100 --> 18:00.080
 Yeah, so this last pigment is a really peculiar one.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.340
 One can think about it as really

18:02.340 --> 18:05.100
 the initial sensitive element in a system

18:05.100 --> 18:07.420
 that's designed to tell your brain

18:07.420 --> 18:09.700
 about how bright things are in your world.

18:11.580 --> 18:14.340
 And the thing that's really peculiar about this pigment

18:14.340 --> 18:17.580
 is that it's in the wrong place, in a sense.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.700
 When you think about the structure of the retina,

18:19.700 --> 18:21.660
 you think about a layer cake, essentially.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.420
 You've got this thin membrane at the back of your eye,

18:24.420 --> 18:26.940
 but it's actually a stack of thin layers.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.580
 And the outermost of those layers

18:28.580 --> 18:29.780
 is where these photoreceptors

18:29.780 --> 18:31.580
 you were talking about earlier are sitting.

18:31.580 --> 18:34.540
 That's where the film of your camera is, essentially.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.100
 That's where the photons do their magic

18:36.100 --> 18:38.260
 with the photopigments and turn it into a neural signal.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.100
 I like that.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.140
 I've never really thought of the photoreceptors

18:40.140 --> 18:41.980
 as the film of the camera, but that makes sense.

18:41.980 --> 18:46.380
 Yeah, or like the sensitive CCD chip in your cell phone.

18:46.380 --> 18:49.220
 It's the surface on which the light pattern is imaged

18:49.220 --> 18:51.860
 by the optics of the eye.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.780
 And now you've got an array of sensors

18:53.780 --> 18:55.860
 that's capturing that information

18:55.860 --> 18:58.700
 and creating a bitmap, essentially.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.180
 But now it's in neural signals

19:00.180 --> 19:02.860
 distributed across the surface of the retina.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.620
 So all of that was known to be going on 150 years ago.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.340
 A couple of types of photoreceptors, cones and rods.

19:10.340 --> 19:13.420
 If you look a little bit more closely, three types of cones.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.180
 That's where the transformation

19:15.180 --> 19:20.060
 from electromagnetic radiation to neural signals

19:20.060 --> 19:22.100
 was thought to take place.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.260
 But it turns out that this last photopigment

19:24.260 --> 19:26.620
 is in the other end of the retina,

19:26.620 --> 19:28.100
 the innermost part of the retina.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.140
 That's where the so-called ganglion cells are.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.740
 Those are the cells that talk to the brain,

19:31.740 --> 19:34.460
 the ones that actually can communicate directly

19:34.460 --> 19:37.820
 what information comes to them from the photoreceptors.

19:37.820 --> 19:40.740
 And here you've got a case where actually

19:40.740 --> 19:42.700
 some of the output neurons

19:42.700 --> 19:45.340
 that we didn't think had any business being directly

19:45.340 --> 19:49.700
 sensitive to light were actually making this photopigment,

19:49.700 --> 19:53.020
 absorbing light and converting that to neural signals

19:53.020 --> 19:54.500
 and sending it to the brain.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.260
 So that made it pretty surprising and unexpected,

19:58.260 --> 20:01.420
 but there are many surprising things about these cells.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.740
 So, and what is the relationship to the fly eye?

20:04.740 --> 20:07.780
 Right, so the link there is that if you ask

20:07.780 --> 20:11.900
 how the photopigment now communicates

20:11.900 --> 20:15.540
 downstream from the initial absorption event

20:15.540 --> 20:17.140
 to get to the electrical signal,

20:17.140 --> 20:19.100
 that's a complex cellular process,

20:19.100 --> 20:21.820
 involves many chemical steps.

20:21.820 --> 20:26.220
 And if you look at how photoreceptors in our eyes work,

20:26.220 --> 20:29.940
 you can see what that cascade is, how that chain works.

20:29.940 --> 20:34.180
 If you look in the eyes of flies or other insects

20:34.180 --> 20:36.260
 or other invertebrates,

20:36.260 --> 20:38.300
 there's a very similar kind of chain,

20:38.300 --> 20:41.060
 but the specifics of how the signals get

20:41.060 --> 20:43.180
 from the absorption event by the pigment

20:43.180 --> 20:44.460
 to the electrical response

20:44.460 --> 20:46.620
 that the nervous system can understand

20:46.620 --> 20:48.500
 are characteristically different

20:48.500 --> 20:53.300
 between fuzzy furry creatures like us

20:53.300 --> 20:56.500
 and insects, for example, like the fly, I say.

20:56.500 --> 21:00.220
 So these funny extra photoreceptors

21:00.220 --> 21:01.300
 that are in the wrong layer

21:01.300 --> 21:02.660
 doing something completely different

21:02.660 --> 21:06.340
 are actually using a chemical cascade

21:06.340 --> 21:07.900
 that looks much more like what you would see

21:07.900 --> 21:09.700
 in a fly photoreceptor

21:09.700 --> 21:12.500
 than what you would see in a human photoreceptor,

21:12.500 --> 21:14.180
 a rod or a cone, for example.

21:14.180 --> 21:17.420
 So it sounds like it's a very primitive part of,

21:17.420 --> 21:19.980
 a primitive aspect of biology that we maintain.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.740
 Exactly right, exactly right.

21:21.740 --> 21:22.900
 And despite the fact that dogs

21:22.900 --> 21:24.700
 can't see as many colors as we can,

21:24.700 --> 21:26.460
 and cats can't see as many colors as we can,

21:26.460 --> 21:29.380
 we have all this extravagant stuff for seeing color.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.180
 And then you've got this other pigment

21:31.180 --> 21:33.300
 sitting in the wrong, not wrong,

21:33.300 --> 21:36.580
 but in a different part of the eye,

21:36.580 --> 21:40.300
 sending, processing light very differently

21:40.300 --> 21:42.460
 and sending that information into the brain.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.580
 So what do these cells do?

21:45.580 --> 21:47.820
 I mean, presumably they're there for a reason.

21:47.820 --> 21:51.340
 They are, and the interesting thing

21:51.340 --> 21:54.740
 is that one cell type like this

21:54.740 --> 21:56.300
 carrying one kind of signal,

21:56.300 --> 22:00.220
 which I would call a brightness signal essentially,

22:00.220 --> 22:02.100
 can do many things in the brain.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.180
 When you say brightness signal,

22:03.180 --> 22:05.060
 you mean that it, like right now,

22:05.060 --> 22:06.660
 I have these cells, do I have these cells?

22:06.660 --> 22:07.500
 You do. Of course not.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.740
 I'm joking, I hope I have these cells in my eye.

22:09.740 --> 22:12.740
 And they're paying attention to how bright it is overall,

22:12.740 --> 22:14.060
 but they're not paying attention, for instance,

22:14.060 --> 22:15.140
 to the edge of your ear

22:15.140 --> 22:16.740
 or what else is going on in the room.

22:16.740 --> 22:18.460
 Right, so it's the difference

22:18.460 --> 22:21.740
 between knowing what the objects are on the table

22:21.740 --> 22:23.180
 and knowing whether it's bright enough

22:23.180 --> 22:25.820
 to be daylight right now.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.500
 So why does your nervous system

22:28.500 --> 22:30.700
 need to know whether it's daylight right now?

22:30.700 --> 22:31.980
 Well, one thing that needs to know,

22:31.980 --> 22:33.980
 that is your circadian clock.

22:33.980 --> 22:37.420
 If you travel across time zones to Europe,

22:37.420 --> 22:41.940
 now your internal clock thinks it's California time,

22:41.940 --> 22:44.300
 but the rotation of the earth

22:44.300 --> 22:46.660
 is for a different part of the planet.

22:46.660 --> 22:47.840
 The rising and setting of the sun

22:47.840 --> 22:50.260
 is not at all what your body is anticipating.

22:50.260 --> 22:52.060
 So you've got an internal representation

22:52.060 --> 22:54.620
 of the rotation of the earth in your own brain.

22:54.620 --> 22:56.140
 That's your circadian system.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.640
 It's keeping time.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.860
 But now you've played a trick on your nervous system.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.340
 You put yourself in a different place

23:02.340 --> 23:05.660
 where the sun is rising at the, quote, wrong time.

23:05.660 --> 23:07.580
 Well, that's not good for you, right?

23:07.580 --> 23:08.940
 So you've got to get back on track.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.980
 One of the things this system does is sends a,

23:11.980 --> 23:14.940
 oh, it's daylight now signal to the brain,

23:14.940 --> 23:16.820
 which compares with its internal clock.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.380
 And if that's not right,

23:18.380 --> 23:20.420
 it tweaks the clock gradually

23:20.420 --> 23:21.800
 until you get over your jet lag

23:21.800 --> 23:24.060
 and you feel back on track again.

23:24.060 --> 23:26.940
 So the jet lag case makes a lot of sense to me,

23:26.940 --> 23:31.360
 but presumably these elements didn't evolve for jet lag.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.200
 Right.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.860
 So what are they doing on a day-to-day basis?

23:35.860 --> 23:37.420
 Right, well, one way to think about this

23:37.420 --> 23:42.420
 is that the clock that you have in not just your brain,

23:42.940 --> 23:45.620
 in all the cells, or almost all of the cells of your body,

23:45.620 --> 23:47.760
 they're all oscillating.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.980
 They're all, you know-

23:48.980 --> 23:49.820
 They got little clocks in them.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.620
 They got little clocks in them themselves.

23:51.620 --> 23:52.760
 They're all clocks.

23:54.620 --> 23:58.800
 You know, they need to be synchronized appropriately.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.800
 And the whole thing has to be built in biological machinery.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.320
 This is actually a beautiful story

24:07.320 --> 24:10.920
 about how gene expression can control gene expression.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.040
 And if you set it up right,

24:12.040 --> 24:15.440
 you can set up a little thing that just sort of hums along

24:15.440 --> 24:16.880
 at a particular frequency.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.280
 In our case, it's humming along at 24 hours,

24:19.280 --> 24:21.000
 because that's how our earth rotates

24:21.000 --> 24:23.420
 and it's all built into our biology.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.800
 So this is great,

24:24.800 --> 24:28.000
 but the reality is that the clock can only be so good.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.560
 I mean, we're talking about biology here.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.320
 It's not precision engineering.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.120
 And so it can be a little bit off.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.880
 Well, also it doesn't, it's in our brain,

24:35.880 --> 24:39.560
 so it doesn't have access to any regular unerring signal.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.020
 Well, if in the absence of the rising

24:42.020 --> 24:43.440
 and setting of the sun, it doesn't,

24:43.440 --> 24:45.520
 if you put someone in a cave,

24:45.520 --> 24:47.780
 their biological clock will keep time

24:47.780 --> 24:51.820
 to within a handful of minutes of 24 hours.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.960
 That's no problem for one day.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.240
 But if this went on without any correction,

24:57.240 --> 24:59.200
 eventually you'd be out of phase.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.480
 And this is actually one of the things

25:00.480 --> 25:03.560
 that blind patients often complain about.

25:03.560 --> 25:08.540
 They've got retinal blindness, is insomnia, and-

25:08.540 --> 25:10.120
 Because their brains are awake in the middle of the night.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.760
 Exactly, they're not synchronized.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.720
 Their clock is there, but they're drifting out of phase

25:14.720 --> 25:19.720
 because their clock's only good to 24.2 hours

25:19.720 --> 25:21.920
 or 23.8 hours.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.120
 Little by little, they're drifting.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.040
 So you need a synchronization signal.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.840
 So even if you never cross time zones,

25:27.840 --> 25:29.680
 and of course we didn't back on the savanna,

25:29.680 --> 25:32.600
 we stayed within walking distance of where we were,

25:34.080 --> 25:35.600
 you still need a synchronizer

25:35.600 --> 25:39.140
 because otherwise you have nothing to actually confirm

25:39.140 --> 25:41.580
 when the rising and the setting of the sun is.

25:41.580 --> 25:44.360
 That's what you're trying to synchronize yourself to.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.120
 I'm fascinated by the circadian clock

25:47.120 --> 25:50.080
 and the fact that all the cells of our body

25:50.080 --> 25:53.340
 have essentially a 24-hour-ish clock in them.

25:53.340 --> 25:54.440
 Right.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.160
 We hear a lot about these circadian rhythms

25:56.160 --> 25:57.240
 and circadian clocks,

25:57.240 --> 26:00.580
 the fact that we need light input from these special neurons

26:00.580 --> 26:02.300
 in order to set the clock,

26:02.300 --> 26:04.320
 but I've never really heard it described

26:04.320 --> 26:06.480
 how the clock itself works

26:06.480 --> 26:10.200
 and how the clock signals to all the rest of the body

26:10.200 --> 26:12.880
 when the liver should be doing one thing

26:12.880 --> 26:15.620
 and when the stomach should be doing another.

26:15.620 --> 26:18.200
 I know you've done some work on the clock.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.620
 So if you would just maybe briefly describe

26:21.620 --> 26:24.520
 where the clock is, what it does,

26:24.520 --> 26:26.880
 and some of the top contour

26:26.880 --> 26:29.800
 of how it tells the cells of the body what to do.

26:29.800 --> 26:30.640
 Right.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.880
 So the first thing to say is that, as you said,

26:32.880 --> 26:34.640
 the clock is all over the place.

26:34.640 --> 26:38.000
 Most of the tissues in your body have clocks.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.880
 We probably have, what, millions of clocks in our body.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.000
 Yeah, I would say that's probably fair.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.340
 You have millions of cell types,

26:43.340 --> 26:45.140
 you probably have millions of clocks.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.920
 That the role of the central pacemaker

26:48.920 --> 26:52.760
 for the circadian system is to coordinate all of these.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.900
 And there's a little nucleus,

26:55.900 --> 26:59.520
 a little collection of nerve cells in your brain.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.720
 It's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the SCN,

27:03.620 --> 27:05.760
 and it is sitting in a funny place

27:05.760 --> 27:07.680
 for the rest of the structures in the nervous system

27:07.680 --> 27:09.600
 that get direct retinal input.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.000
 It's sitting in the hypothalamus,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.480
 which you can think about as sort of the great coordinator

27:15.480 --> 27:19.760
 of drives and- The source of all our pleasures

27:19.760 --> 27:21.080
 and all our problems. Right.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.120
 Or most our problems.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.000
 Yes, it really is.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.220
 But it's sort of deep in your brain,

27:26.220 --> 27:28.040
 things that drive you to do things.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.480
 If you're freezing cold, you put on a coat, you shivery,

27:31.480 --> 27:34.160
 all these things are coordinated by the hypothalamus.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.600
 So this pathway that we're talking about from the retina

27:37.600 --> 27:39.680
 and from these peculiar cells

27:39.680 --> 27:41.840
 that are encoding light intensity

27:41.840 --> 27:45.420
 are sending signals directly into a center

27:45.420 --> 27:47.960
 that's surrounded by all of these centers

27:47.960 --> 27:51.040
 that control autonomic nervous system

27:51.040 --> 27:55.020
 and your hormonal systems.

27:55.020 --> 27:57.240
 So this is a part of your visual system

27:57.240 --> 27:59.440
 that doesn't really reach the level of consciousness.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.860
 It's not something you think about.

28:01.860 --> 28:05.840
 It's happening under the radar kind of all the time.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.480
 And the signal is working its way

28:07.480 --> 28:12.340
 into this central clock coordinating center.

28:12.340 --> 28:16.500
 Now, what happens then is not that well understood,

28:16.500 --> 28:19.100
 but it's clear that this is a neural center

28:19.100 --> 28:20.740
 that has the same ability to communicate

28:20.740 --> 28:24.700
 with other parts of your brain as any other neural center.

28:24.700 --> 28:27.900
 And clearly there are circuits

28:27.900 --> 28:30.340
 that involve connections between neurons

28:30.340 --> 28:33.220
 that are conventional.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.460
 But in addition, it's quite clear

28:34.460 --> 28:36.620
 that there are also sort of humoral effects

28:36.620 --> 28:41.180
 that things are oozing out of the cells in the center

28:41.180 --> 28:43.580
 and maybe into the circulation

28:43.580 --> 28:47.620
 or just diffusing through the brain to some extent

28:47.620 --> 28:50.660
 that can also affect neurons all square.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.780
 But the hypothalamus uses everything

28:52.780 --> 28:54.260
 to control the rest of the bodies.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.620
 And that's true of the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

28:56.620 --> 28:59.020
 this circadian center as well.

29:00.380 --> 29:03.380
 It can get its fingers into the autonomic nervous system,

29:03.380 --> 29:04.740
 the humoral system,

29:04.740 --> 29:07.140
 and of course up to the centers of the brain

29:07.140 --> 29:12.140
 that organize coordinated rational behavior.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.300
 So if I understand correctly,

29:14.300 --> 29:16.620
 we have this group of cells, the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

29:16.620 --> 29:18.500
 it's got a 24 hour rhythm.

29:19.940 --> 29:21.620
 That rhythm is more or less matched

29:21.620 --> 29:23.840
 to what's going on in our external world

29:23.840 --> 29:26.460
 by the specialized set of neurons in our eye.

29:26.460 --> 29:30.500
 But then the master clock itself, the SCN,

29:30.500 --> 29:33.120
 releases things in the blood, humoral signals,

29:33.120 --> 29:37.840
 that go out various places in the body.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.360
 And then you said to the autonomic system,

29:39.360 --> 29:42.120
 which is regulating more or less how alert or calm we are,

29:42.120 --> 29:44.240
 as well as our thinking and our cognition.

29:45.240 --> 29:49.200
 So I'd love to talk to you about the autonomic part.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.200
 Presumably that's through melatonin,

29:52.200 --> 29:55.640
 it's through adrenaline.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.360
 How is it that this clock is impacting

29:58.360 --> 30:02.080
 how the autonomic system, how alert or calm we feel?

30:02.080 --> 30:05.160
 Right, so there are pathways

30:05.160 --> 30:09.320
 by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus can access

30:09.320 --> 30:12.300
 both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.440
 Just so people know, the sympathetic nervous system

30:14.440 --> 30:16.200
 is the one that tends to make us more alert,

30:16.200 --> 30:18.140
 and the parasympathetic nervous system

30:18.140 --> 30:20.920
 is the portion of the autonomic nervous system

30:20.920 --> 30:24.160
 makes us feel more calm in broad context.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.800
 To first approximation, right.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.920
 So this is, both of these systems

30:28.920 --> 30:33.080
 are within the grasp of the circadian system

30:33.080 --> 30:35.240
 through hypothalamic circuits.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.360
 One of the circuits that will be,

30:37.360 --> 30:40.080
 I think, of particular interest to some of your listeners,

30:40.080 --> 30:44.120
 is a pathway that involves this sympathetic branch

30:44.120 --> 30:47.780
 of the autonomic nervous system, the fight or flight system,

30:47.780 --> 30:50.920
 that is actually through a very circuitous route,

30:50.920 --> 30:52.820
 innervating the pineal gland,

30:52.820 --> 30:55.420
 which is sitting in the middle of your brain.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.020
 The so-called third eye.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.400
 Right, so this is the-

30:58.400 --> 31:00.640
 We'll have to get back to why it's called the third eye,

31:00.640 --> 31:01.600
 because, yeah.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.440
 That's an interesting history.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.080
 You can't call something the third eye and not,

31:04.080 --> 31:05.280
 and just, you know.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.100
 Just leave it there.

31:06.100 --> 31:06.940
 Just leave it there.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.480
 Right. Right.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.540
 Anyway, this is the major source of melatonin in your body.

31:11.540 --> 31:14.140
 So light comes into my eye.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.240
 Yes.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.640
 Passed off to the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

31:17.640 --> 31:18.920
 essentially not the light itself,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.280
 but the signal representing the light.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.120
 Sure.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.340
 Then the SCN, the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

31:24.340 --> 31:27.840
 can impact the melatonin system

31:27.840 --> 31:28.920
 via the pineal.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.640
 Right, the way this is seen is that

31:30.640 --> 31:33.920
 if you were to measure your melatonin level

31:33.920 --> 31:35.620
 over the course of the day,

31:35.620 --> 31:38.180
 if you could do this, you know, hour by hour,

31:38.180 --> 31:40.520
 you'd see that it's really low during the day,

31:40.520 --> 31:42.200
 very high at night.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.120
 But if you get up in the middle of the night

31:44.120 --> 31:44.960
 and go to the bathroom

31:44.960 --> 31:47.120
 and turn on the bright fluorescent light,

31:47.120 --> 31:49.480
 your melatonin level is slammed to the floor.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.360
 Light is directly impacting your hormonal levels

31:54.360 --> 31:57.180
 through this mechanism that we just described.

31:57.180 --> 32:00.560
 So this is one of the routes by which light can act

32:00.560 --> 32:04.440
 on your hormonal status through pathways

32:04.440 --> 32:06.440
 that are completely beyond

32:06.440 --> 32:08.440
 what you normally would think about, right?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.540
 You're thinking about the things in the bathroom.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.080
 Oh, there's the toothbrush.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.840
 You know, there's the tube of toothpaste.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.680
 But meanwhile, this other system is just counting photons

32:17.680 --> 32:20.120
 and saying, oh, wow, there's a lot of photons right now.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.480
 Let's shut down the melatonin release.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.600
 This is one of the main reasons why I've encouraged people

32:25.600 --> 32:28.280
 to avoid bright light exposure in the middle of the night,

32:28.280 --> 32:32.080
 not just blue light, but bright light of any wavelength.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.780
 Because there's this myth out there that blue light,

32:34.780 --> 32:37.680
 because it's the optimal signal for activating this pathway

32:37.680 --> 32:39.500
 and shutting down melatonin,

32:39.500 --> 32:43.380
 is the only wavelength of light that can shut it down.

32:43.380 --> 32:45.880
 But am I correct in thinking that if a light

32:45.880 --> 32:48.760
 is bright enough, it doesn't matter if it's blue light,

32:48.760 --> 32:51.680
 green light, purple light, even red light,

32:51.680 --> 32:54.680
 you're going to slam melatonin down to the ground,

32:54.680 --> 32:56.960
 which is not a good thing to happen

32:56.960 --> 32:58.360
 in the middle of the night, correct?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.280
 Right, yeah.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.440
 I mean, any light will affect the system to some extent.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.400
 The blue light is somewhat more effective,

33:06.400 --> 33:08.960
 but don't fool yourself into thinking

33:08.960 --> 33:09.880
 that if you use red light,

33:09.880 --> 33:12.600
 that means you're avoiding the effect.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.440
 It's certainly still there.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.640
 And certainly if it's very bright,

33:15.640 --> 33:18.400
 it'll be more effective in driving the system

33:18.400 --> 33:20.020
 than dim blue light would be.

33:20.020 --> 33:20.860
 Interesting.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.480
 A lot of people wear blue blockers.

33:22.480 --> 33:27.480
 And in a kind of odd twist of misinformation out there,

33:27.480 --> 33:28.760
 a lot of people wear blue blockers

33:28.760 --> 33:30.120
 during the middle of the day,

33:30.120 --> 33:31.880
 which basically makes no sense

33:31.880 --> 33:33.000
 because during the middle of the day

33:33.000 --> 33:35.800
 is when you want to get a lot of bright light

33:35.800 --> 33:38.360
 and including blue light into your eyes, correct?

33:38.360 --> 33:39.200
 Absolutely.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.560
 And not just for the reasons we've been talking about

33:41.560 --> 33:43.440
 in terms of circadian effects.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.080
 There are major effects of light on mood.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.960
 And seasonal affective disorder

33:49.960 --> 33:52.640
 apparently is essentially a reflection

33:52.640 --> 33:54.760
 of this same system in reverse.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.600
 If you're living in the Northern climes

33:57.600 --> 33:59.520
 and you're not getting that much light

33:59.520 --> 34:02.560
 during the middle of the winter in Stockholm,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.520
 you might be prone to depression

34:05.520 --> 34:08.320
 and phototherapy might be just the ticket for you.

34:08.320 --> 34:12.480
 And that's because there's a direct effect of light on mood.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.400
 There's an example where if you don't have enough light,

34:15.400 --> 34:16.600
 it's a problem.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.600
 So I think you're exactly right.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.080
 It's not about, is light good or bad for you?

34:20.080 --> 34:22.360
 It's about what kind of light and when

34:22.360 --> 34:25.400
 that makes the difference.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.240
 Yeah, the general rule of thumb that I've been living by

34:27.240 --> 34:29.080
 is to get as much bright light in my eyes,

34:29.080 --> 34:32.840
 ideally from sunlight, anytime I want to be alert

34:32.840 --> 34:36.240
 and doing exactly the opposite when I want to be asleep

34:36.240 --> 34:37.080
 or getting drowsy.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.840
 And there are aspects of this that spin out

34:40.840 --> 34:42.640
 way beyond the conversation we're having now

34:42.640 --> 34:44.320
 to things like this.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.560
 It turns out that the incidence of myopia,

34:47.560 --> 34:48.640
 nearsightedness.

34:48.640 --> 34:52.680
 Nearsightedness, right, is strongly related

34:52.680 --> 34:56.160
 to the amount of time that kids spend outdoors.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.760
 In what direction of effect?

34:57.760 --> 34:59.800
 The more they spend time outdoors,

34:59.800 --> 35:02.120
 the less nearsightedness they have.

35:02.120 --> 35:02.960
 So this is all about-

35:02.960 --> 35:04.480
 And is that because they're viewing things at a distance

35:04.480 --> 35:07.080
 or because they're getting a lot of blue light, sunlight?

35:07.080 --> 35:08.280
 It's a great question.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.600
 It is not fully resolved what the epidemiological,

35:11.600 --> 35:14.360
 what the basis of that epidemiological finding is.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.160
 One possibility is the amount of light,

35:16.160 --> 35:17.680
 which would make me think about this

35:17.680 --> 35:19.960
 melanopsin system again,

35:19.960 --> 35:22.720
 but it might very well be a question of accommodation.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.240
 That is the process by which you focus

35:24.240 --> 35:25.960
 on near or far things.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.360
 If you're never outdoors, everything is nearby.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.320
 If you're outdoors, you're focusing far.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.560
 So this is- Unless you're on your phone.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.880
 Right, exactly.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.040
 There's a tremendous amount of interest these days

35:36.040 --> 35:39.560
 in watches and things that count steps.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.160
 I'm beginning to realize that we should probably have

35:42.160 --> 35:45.920
 a device that can count photons during the day.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.960
 And can also count photons at night and tell us,

35:47.960 --> 35:49.440
 hey, you're getting too many photons.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.040
 You're going to shut down your melatonin at night

35:51.040 --> 35:52.360
 or you're not getting enough photons.

35:52.360 --> 35:53.920
 Today you didn't get enough bright light,

35:53.920 --> 35:56.760
 whether or not it's from artificial light or from sunlight.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.040
 I guess the, where would you put it?

35:58.040 --> 35:59.480
 I guess you put it on the top of your head or something.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.640
 You'd probably want it someplace outward facing.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.600
 Right, probably what you need is as many photons

36:05.600 --> 36:07.280
 over as much of the retina as possible

36:07.280 --> 36:11.360
 to recruit as much of this system as possible.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.640
 In thinking about other effects

36:12.640 --> 36:16.080
 of this non-image forming pathway

36:16.080 --> 36:19.760
 that involves these special cells in the eye and the SCN,

36:19.760 --> 36:21.560
 you had a paper a few years ago

36:21.560 --> 36:26.560
 looking at retinal input to an area of the brain,

36:27.880 --> 36:30.760
 which has a fancy name, the perihabenula,

36:30.760 --> 36:33.000
 but names don't necessarily matter,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.400
 that had some important effects on mood

36:36.400 --> 36:39.440
 and other aspects of light.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.720
 Maybe you could tell us a little bit about

36:40.720 --> 36:42.800
 what is the perihabenula.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.120
 Oh, wow, so that's a fancy term,

36:45.120 --> 36:47.080
 but I think the way to think about this

36:47.080 --> 36:49.680
 is as a chunk of the brain

36:49.680 --> 36:52.720
 that is sitting as part of a bigger chunk

36:52.720 --> 36:57.160
 that's really the linker between peripheral sensory input

36:57.160 --> 36:59.800
 of all kinds, virtually all kinds,

37:01.100 --> 37:04.600
 whether it's auditory input or tactile input

37:05.640 --> 37:08.520
 or visual input to the region of your brain,

37:08.520 --> 37:11.160
 the cortex that allows you to think about these things

37:11.160 --> 37:12.720
 and make plans around them

37:12.720 --> 37:15.080
 and to integrate them and that kind of thing.

37:16.960 --> 37:21.960
 So, we've known about a pathway

37:22.440 --> 37:25.320
 that gets from the retina

37:25.320 --> 37:27.960
 through this sort of linker center,

37:27.960 --> 37:31.560
 it's called the thalamus, and then on up to the cortex.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.520
 Exactly, but you wanna arrive at the destination, right?

37:34.520 --> 37:35.480
 Now you're at Grand Central

37:35.480 --> 37:38.360
 and now you can do your thing as you're up at the cortex.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.120
 So, this is the standard pattern.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.880
 You have the sensory input coming from the periphery.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.400
 You've got these peripheral elements

37:43.400 --> 37:46.000
 that are doing the initial stages of-

37:46.000 --> 37:47.520
 The eye, the ear, the nose.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.800
 The skin of your fingertips, right?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.520
 You know, the taste buds on your tongue.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.480
 They're taking this raw information in

37:54.920 --> 37:56.860
 and they're doing some pre-processing maybe,

37:56.860 --> 37:58.900
 or the early circuits are,

37:58.900 --> 38:00.400
 but eventually most of these signals

38:00.400 --> 38:02.660
 have to pass through the gateway to the cortex,

38:02.660 --> 38:04.680
 which is the thalamus.

38:04.680 --> 38:09.160
 And we've known for years, for decades, many decades,

38:09.160 --> 38:11.120
 what the major throughput pathway

38:11.120 --> 38:13.560
 from the retina to the cortex is,

38:13.560 --> 38:14.500
 and where it ends up.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.840
 It ends up in the visual cortex.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.280
 You know, you pat the back of your head.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.800
 That's where the receiving center is

38:20.800 --> 38:23.840
 for the main pathway from retina to cortex.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.720
 But wait a minute, there's more.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.560
 There's this little side pathway

38:27.560 --> 38:28.680
 that goes through a different part

38:28.680 --> 38:31.720
 of that linking thalamus center,

38:31.720 --> 38:32.560
 the gateway to the cortex.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.120
 It's like a local train

38:34.120 --> 38:34.960
 from Grand Central to-

38:34.960 --> 38:37.600
 It's in a weird part of the neighborhood, right?

38:37.600 --> 38:39.000
 It's a completely different,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.560
 it's like a little trunk line that branches off

38:41.560 --> 38:43.640
 and goes out into the hinterlands.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.460
 And it's going to the part of this linker center

38:46.460 --> 38:48.800
 that's talking to a completely different part of cortex,

38:48.800 --> 38:51.320
 way up front, frontal lobe,

38:51.320 --> 38:54.120
 which is much more involved in things like planning

38:54.120 --> 38:57.680
 or self-image or-

38:57.680 --> 38:59.240
 Self-image, literally how one thinks about-

38:59.240 --> 39:00.800
 Refuse oneself.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.920
 You know, do you feel good about yourself?

39:02.920 --> 39:06.480
 Or, you know, what's your plan for next Thursday?

39:07.920 --> 39:11.040
 You know, it's a very high level center

39:11.040 --> 39:13.600
 in the highest level of your nervous system.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.080
 And this is the region that is getting input

39:16.080 --> 39:17.200
 from this pathway,

39:17.200 --> 39:19.820
 which is mostly worked out in its function

39:19.820 --> 39:21.360
 by Samir Hatara's lab.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.200
 I know you had him on the podcast.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.240
 We didn't talk about this pathway.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.660
 This pathway at all, right.

39:25.660 --> 39:30.160
 So, Diego Fernandez and Samir

39:30.160 --> 39:32.120
 and the folks that work with them

39:32.120 --> 39:35.040
 were able to show that this pathway doesn't just exist

39:35.040 --> 39:37.160
 and get you to a weird place.

39:37.160 --> 39:41.940
 But if you activate it at kind of the wrong time of day,

39:43.040 --> 39:45.360
 animals can become depressed.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.760
 And if you silence it under the right circumstances,

39:48.760 --> 39:52.000
 then weird lighting cycles that would normally

39:52.000 --> 39:55.560
 make them act sort of depressed

39:55.560 --> 39:57.560
 no longer have that effect.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.280
 So, it sounds to me like there's this pathway

39:59.280 --> 40:03.760
 from I to this unusual train route

40:03.760 --> 40:06.760
 through the structure we call the thalamus,

40:06.760 --> 40:08.120
 then up to the front of the brain

40:08.120 --> 40:11.600
 that relates to things of self-perception,

40:11.600 --> 40:13.360
 kind of higher level functions.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.460
 I find that really interesting

40:14.460 --> 40:15.600
 because most of what I think about

40:15.600 --> 40:17.760
 when I think about these fancy,

40:17.760 --> 40:20.280
 well, or these primitive, rather,

40:20.280 --> 40:22.840
 neurons that don't pay attention to the shapes of things,

40:22.840 --> 40:24.220
 but instead to brightness,

40:24.220 --> 40:26.240
 I think of, well, it regulates melatonin,

40:26.240 --> 40:28.780
 circadian clock, mood, hunger,

40:28.780 --> 40:32.520
 the really kind of vegetative stuff, if you will.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.240
 And this is interesting

40:34.240 --> 40:37.840
 because I think a lot of people experience depression,

40:37.840 --> 40:40.640
 not just people that live in Scandinavia

40:40.640 --> 40:42.120
 in the middle of winter.

40:42.120 --> 40:45.080
 And we are very much divorced

40:45.080 --> 40:47.800
 from our normal interactions with light.

40:48.840 --> 40:49.780
 It also makes me realize

40:49.780 --> 40:52.220
 that these intrinsically photosensitive cells

40:52.220 --> 40:53.780
 that set the clock, et cetera,

40:53.780 --> 40:56.600
 are involved in a lot of things.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.280
 I mean, they seem to regulate

40:59.280 --> 41:01.500
 a dozen or more different basic functions.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.440
 I want to ask you about

41:04.440 --> 41:06.880
 a different aspect of the visual system now,

41:06.880 --> 41:10.880
 which is the one that relates to our sense of balance.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.680
 So I love boats, but I hate being on them.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.380
 I love the ocean from shore

41:15.380 --> 41:17.720
 because I get incredibly seasick.

41:19.160 --> 41:20.460
 It's awful, I think I'm going to get seasick

41:20.460 --> 41:22.080
 if I think about it too much.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.280
 And once I went on a boat trip,

41:23.280 --> 41:27.400
 I came back and I actually got motion sick

41:27.400 --> 41:30.280
 or wasn't seasick because I went rafting.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.680
 So there's a system that somehow gets messed up.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.760
 They always tell us if you're feeling sick

41:34.760 --> 41:37.360
 to look at the horizon, et cetera, et cetera.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.520
 So what is the link between our visual system

41:39.520 --> 41:40.720
 and our balance system?

41:40.720 --> 41:43.360
 And why does it make us nauseous sometimes

41:43.360 --> 41:45.680
 when the world is moving in a way

41:45.680 --> 41:47.360
 that we're not accustomed to?

41:47.360 --> 41:48.920
 I realize this is a big question

41:48.920 --> 41:51.640
 because it involves eye movement, et cetera,

41:51.640 --> 41:56.360
 but let's maybe just walk in at the simplest layers

41:56.360 --> 42:01.360
 of vision, vestibular, so-called balance system,

42:01.360 --> 42:04.360
 and then maybe we can piece the system together for people

42:04.360 --> 42:05.200
 so that they can understand.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.920
 And then also we should give them some tools

42:06.920 --> 42:08.680
 for adjusting their nausea

42:08.680 --> 42:12.040
 when their vestibular system is out of whack.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.500
 Cool, so I mean, the first thing to think about

42:14.500 --> 42:19.040
 is that the vestibular system is designed

42:19.040 --> 42:24.040
 to allow you to see how your, or detect, sense,

42:25.720 --> 42:29.000
 how you're moving in the world, through the world.

42:31.040 --> 42:34.360
 It's a funny one because it's about your movement

42:34.360 --> 42:36.300
 in relationship to the world in a sense,

42:36.300 --> 42:39.440
 and yet it's sort of interoceptive in the sense

42:39.440 --> 42:44.320
 that it is really in the end sensing

42:44.320 --> 42:46.160
 the movement of your own body.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.120
 Okay, so interoception we should probably delineate

42:48.120 --> 42:50.640
 for people is when you're focusing on your internal state

42:50.640 --> 42:52.140
 as opposed to something outside you.

42:52.140 --> 42:52.980
 Right.

42:52.980 --> 42:55.280
 But it's a gravity sensing system.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.520
 Well, it's partly a gravity sensing system

42:57.520 --> 43:02.520
 in the sense that gravity is a force that's acting on you

43:02.760 --> 43:05.380
 as if you were moving through the world

43:05.380 --> 43:06.860
 in the opposite direction.

43:06.860 --> 43:10.440
 All right, now you got to explain that one to me.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.920
 Okay, so basically the idea is that

43:14.580 --> 43:16.840
 if we leave gravity aside,

43:16.840 --> 43:21.800
 we're just sitting in a car in the passenger seat

43:21.800 --> 43:24.480
 and the driver hits the accelerator

43:24.480 --> 43:26.720
 and you start moving forward, you sense that.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.400
 If your eyes were closed, you'd sense it.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.560
 If your ears were plugged and your eyes were closed,

43:30.560 --> 43:31.720
 you'd still know it.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.880
 Yeah, many people take off on the plane like this,

43:33.880 --> 43:35.080
 they're dreading the flight

43:35.080 --> 43:36.880
 and they know when the plane is taking off.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.920
 Sure, that's your vestibular system talking

43:38.920 --> 43:40.900
 because anything that jostles you

43:40.900 --> 43:43.080
 out of the current position you're in right now

43:43.080 --> 43:46.660
 will be detected by the vestibular system, pretty much.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.600
 So this is a complicated system,

43:49.600 --> 43:52.860
 but it's basically in your inner ear,

43:52.860 --> 43:54.360
 very close to where you're hearing.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.360
 I can put it there.

43:57.040 --> 43:57.880
 And I don't know who they is.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.280
 I don't really know, they're starting to ride.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.400
 I'm just kidding.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.960
 To steal our friend Russ Van Gelder's explanation,

44:03.960 --> 44:06.560
 we weren't consulted the design phase and no one-

44:06.560 --> 44:07.560
 That's a great line.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.800
 That's a great line.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.880
 But it's interesting, it's in the ear.

44:11.880 --> 44:14.640
 Yeah, it's deep in there

44:14.640 --> 44:18.520
 and it's served by the same nerve, actually,

44:18.520 --> 44:20.620
 that serves the hearing system.

44:20.620 --> 44:23.420
 One way to think about it is both the hearing system

44:23.420 --> 44:26.880
 and the vestibular self-motion sensing system

44:26.880 --> 44:29.320
 are really detecting the signal in the same way.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.680
 They're hairy cells and they're excited.

44:32.680 --> 44:33.520
 Hairy cells?

44:33.520 --> 44:34.640
 Yeah, sort of, they got little cilia

44:34.640 --> 44:36.820
 sticking up off the surfaces.

44:36.820 --> 44:38.720
 And depending on which way you bend those,

44:38.720 --> 44:41.080
 the cells will either be inhibited or excited.

44:41.080 --> 44:44.080
 They're not even neurons, but then they talk to neurons

44:44.080 --> 44:46.140
 with a neuron-like process and off you go.

44:46.140 --> 44:47.560
 Now you've got an auditory signal

44:47.560 --> 44:51.480
 if you're sensing things bouncing around in your cochlea,

44:51.480 --> 44:53.120
 which is- Sound waves.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.760
 Sympathetically, the bouncing of your eardrum,

44:55.760 --> 44:58.800
 which is sympathetically the sound waves in the world.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.280
 But in the case of the vestibular apparatus,

45:01.280 --> 45:04.500
 evolution has built a system that detects the motion

45:04.500 --> 45:07.880
 of say fluid going by those hairs.

45:07.880 --> 45:11.320
 And if you put a sensor like that in a tube

45:11.320 --> 45:14.040
 that's fluid-filled, now you've got a sensor

45:14.040 --> 45:17.960
 that will be activated when you rotate that tube

45:17.960 --> 45:20.020
 around the axis that passes through the middle of it.

45:20.020 --> 45:21.120
 Those, you know, we're just listening,

45:21.120 --> 45:22.440
 won't be able to visualize that.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.360
 No, I think that makes sense.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.420
 I was thinking of it as three hula hoops.

45:25.420 --> 45:26.260
 Right, three hula hoops.

45:26.260 --> 45:28.320
 One standing up, one lying down on the ground.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
 Right, one the other way.

45:30.320 --> 45:31.680
 Three directions.

45:32.680 --> 45:35.080
 The people who fly will talk about roll, pitch, and yaw,

45:35.080 --> 45:35.920
 that kind of thing.

45:35.920 --> 45:39.280
 So the three axes of encoding,

45:39.280 --> 45:40.120
 just like in the cones of the retina.

45:40.120 --> 45:43.240
 Sort of the yes, the no, and then I always say it's,

45:43.240 --> 45:44.400
 and then the puppy head tilt.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.600
 Yeah, the puppy head tilt.

45:45.600 --> 45:46.720
 That's the other one.

45:46.720 --> 45:50.160
 So the point is that your brain is eventually going

45:50.160 --> 45:54.640
 to be able to unpack what these sensors are telling you

45:54.640 --> 45:58.040
 about how you just rotated your head in very much the way

45:58.040 --> 46:01.520
 that the three types of cones we were talking about before

46:01.520 --> 46:04.920
 are reading the incoming photons

46:04.920 --> 46:06.880
 in the wavelength domain differently.

46:06.880 --> 46:07.880
 Red, green, and blue.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.960
 Yeah, you can compare and trust, you get red, green, and blue.

46:09.960 --> 46:11.720
 So it's the same basic idea.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.640
 If you have three sensors and you array them properly,

46:14.640 --> 46:17.320
 now you can tell if you're rotating your head left or right,

46:17.320 --> 46:18.500
 up or down.

46:18.500 --> 46:22.480
 That's the sensory signal coming back into your brain,

46:23.320 --> 46:26.600
 confirming that you've just made a movement that you will.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.720
 But what about on the plane?

46:27.720 --> 46:29.760
 Because when I'm on the plane, I'm completely stationary.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.460
 The plane's moving, but my head hasn't moved.

46:32.460 --> 46:35.460
 So I'm just moving forward, gravity is constant.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.300
 Exactly.

46:36.300 --> 46:37.920
 How do I know I'm accelerating?

46:37.920 --> 46:41.120
 So what's happening now is your brain is sensing the motion

46:42.440 --> 46:45.960
 and the brain is smart enough also to ask itself,

46:45.960 --> 46:50.580
 did I will that movement or did that come from the outside?

46:50.580 --> 46:52.560
 So now in terms of sort of understanding

46:52.560 --> 46:54.720
 what the distributor signal means,

46:54.720 --> 46:56.340
 it's gotta be embedded in the context

46:56.340 --> 46:57.920
 of what you tried to do

46:57.920 --> 47:01.760
 or what your other sensory systems are telling you

47:01.760 --> 47:02.720
 about what's happening right now.

47:02.720 --> 47:03.560
 I see.

47:03.560 --> 47:06.640
 So it's very interesting, but it's not conscious.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.440
 Or at least if it's conscious, it's not conscious,

47:09.440 --> 47:11.560
 it's definitely very fast, right?

47:11.560 --> 47:12.860
 The moment that plane starts moving,

47:12.860 --> 47:14.520
 I know that I didn't get up out of my chair

47:14.520 --> 47:15.360
 and run forward.

47:15.360 --> 47:16.180
 Right.

47:16.180 --> 47:18.600
 But I'm not really thinking about getting up out of my chair

47:18.600 --> 47:19.440
 I just know.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.560
 I guess the way I think about it is that

47:21.560 --> 47:26.440
 the nervous system is quote, aware at many levels.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.020
 When it gets all the way up to the cortex

47:29.020 --> 47:32.320
 and we're thinking about it, you're talking about it.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.160
 You know, that's cortical,

47:34.160 --> 47:37.360
 but the lower levels of the brain

47:37.360 --> 47:40.400
 that don't require you to actually actively think about it,

47:40.400 --> 47:44.040
 they're just doing their thing, are also made aware, right?

47:44.040 --> 47:45.880
 A lot of this is happening under the surface

47:45.880 --> 47:47.080
 of what you're thinking.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.760
 These are reflexes.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.600
 Okay.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.440
 So we've got this gravity sensing system.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.280
 Right.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.080
 I'm nodding for those that are listening

47:57.080 --> 48:00.360
 for a yes movement of the head, a no movement of the head,

48:00.360 --> 48:02.720
 or the tilting of the head from side to side.

48:02.720 --> 48:03.560
 Right.

48:03.560 --> 48:06.160
 And then you said that knowledge about whether or not

48:06.160 --> 48:08.960
 activation of that system comes from my own movements

48:08.960 --> 48:12.520
 or something acting upon me, like the plane moving,

48:12.520 --> 48:15.640
 has to be combined with other signals.

48:15.640 --> 48:19.580
 And so how is the visual information

48:19.580 --> 48:21.040
 or information about the visual world

48:21.040 --> 48:22.880
 combined with balance information?

48:22.880 --> 48:23.700
 Right.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.560
 So, yeah, I mean, I guess maybe the best way

48:26.560 --> 48:29.960
 to think about how these two systems work together

48:29.960 --> 48:31.080
 is to think about what happens

48:31.080 --> 48:34.020
 when you suddenly rotate your head to the left.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.620
 When you suddenly rotate your head to the left,

48:36.620 --> 48:40.840
 your eyes are actually rotating to the right automatically.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.240
 You do this in complete darkness.

48:43.240 --> 48:48.080
 If you had an infrared camera and watched yourself

48:48.080 --> 48:49.760
 in complete darkness, you can't see anything.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.800
 Rotating your head to the left,

48:50.800 --> 48:52.480
 your eyes would rotate to the right.

48:52.480 --> 48:54.420
 That's your vestibular system saying,

48:54.420 --> 48:59.420
 it's, I'm going to try to compensate for the head rotation,

48:59.820 --> 49:02.980
 so my eyes are still looking in the same place.

49:02.980 --> 49:04.220
 Why is that useful?

49:04.220 --> 49:07.460
 Well, if it's always doing that,

49:07.460 --> 49:09.300
 then the image of the world on your retina

49:09.300 --> 49:11.820
 will be pretty stable most of the time.

49:11.820 --> 49:13.860
 And that actually helps vision.

49:13.860 --> 49:17.340
 Have they built this into cameras for image stabilization?

49:17.340 --> 49:19.460
 Because when I move, when I take a picture with my phone,

49:19.460 --> 49:21.500
 it's blurry, it's not clear.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.620
 Well, actually, you might want to get a better phone

49:24.620 --> 49:28.700
 because now what they have is software in the better abs

49:28.700 --> 49:31.620
 that will do a kind of image stabilization post hoc

49:31.620 --> 49:33.460
 by doing a registration of the images

49:33.460 --> 49:34.780
 that are bouncing around.

49:34.780 --> 49:37.260
 They say the edge of the house was here,

49:37.260 --> 49:39.580
 so let's get that aligned in each of your images.

49:39.580 --> 49:43.740
 So you may not be aware if you're using a good new phone,

49:43.740 --> 49:48.740
 that if you walk around a landscape and hold your phone,

49:48.740 --> 49:51.860
 that there's all this image stabilization going on.

49:51.860 --> 49:56.860
 But it's built into standard cinematic technology now,

49:57.100 --> 49:58.980
 because if you tried to do a handheld camera,

49:58.980 --> 50:01.620
 things would be bouncing around, things would be unwatchable,

50:01.620 --> 50:02.940
 you wouldn't be able to really understand

50:02.940 --> 50:04.340
 what's going on in the scene.

50:04.340 --> 50:09.140
 So the brain works really hard to mostly stabilize

50:09.140 --> 50:10.900
 the image of the world on your retina.

50:10.900 --> 50:12.340
 Now, of course, you're moving through the world,

50:12.340 --> 50:13.780
 so you can't stabilize everything.

50:13.780 --> 50:16.580
 But the more you can stabilize most of the time,

50:16.580 --> 50:19.060
 the better you can see.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.980
 And that's why when we're scanning a scene,

50:22.860 --> 50:24.620
 looking around at things,

50:24.620 --> 50:26.860
 we're making very rapid eye movements

50:26.860 --> 50:30.460
 for very short periods of time, and then we just rest.

50:30.460 --> 50:31.940
 But we're not the only ones that do that.

50:31.940 --> 50:33.100
 If you ever watch a hummingbird,

50:33.100 --> 50:35.540
 it does exactly the same thing in a feeder, right?

50:35.540 --> 50:38.640
 But it's with its body, it's gonna make a quick movement,

50:39.900 --> 50:41.460
 and then it's gonna be stable.

50:41.460 --> 50:44.540
 And when you watch a pigeon walking on the sidewalk,

50:44.540 --> 50:46.160
 it does this funny head bobbing thing.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.820
 But what it's really doing is racking its head back

50:48.820 --> 50:51.260
 on its neck while its body goes forward,

50:51.260 --> 50:54.380
 so that the image of the visual world stays static.

50:54.380 --> 50:55.880
 Is that why they're doing it?

50:55.880 --> 50:56.820
 Yes.

50:56.820 --> 50:59.540
 And you've seen the funny chicken videos on YouTube, right?

50:59.540 --> 51:01.060
 You take a chicken, move it up and down,

51:01.060 --> 51:02.140
 the head stays in one place.

51:02.140 --> 51:03.700
 It's all the same thing.

51:03.700 --> 51:06.220
 All of these animals are trying hard

51:06.220 --> 51:08.820
 to keep the image of the world stable on their retina

51:08.820 --> 51:10.860
 as much of the time as they possibly can.

51:10.860 --> 51:13.340
 And then when they've gotta move, make it fast,

51:13.340 --> 51:15.460
 make it quick, and then stabilize again.

51:15.460 --> 51:16.860
 So are the pigeons have their head back?

51:16.860 --> 51:18.020
 It is, yeah.

51:18.020 --> 51:19.300
 Wow.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.140
 Yeah.

51:20.140 --> 51:22.180
 I think I just need to pause there for a second

51:22.180 --> 51:23.180
 and digest that.

51:23.180 --> 51:24.020
 Amazing.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.080
 In case people aren't, well, there's no reason

51:29.080 --> 51:30.860
 why people would know what we're doing here,

51:30.860 --> 51:32.740
 but essentially what we're doing is we're building up

51:32.740 --> 51:36.780
 from sensory, light onto the eye, color,

51:36.780 --> 51:40.520
 to what the brain does with that, the integration of that,

51:40.520 --> 51:42.100
 circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.460
 And now what we're doing is we're talking about

51:43.460 --> 51:48.460
 multi-sensory or multimodal, combining one sense, vision,

51:48.560 --> 51:50.580
 with another sense, balance.

51:50.580 --> 51:53.580
 And it turns out that pigeons know more about this

51:53.580 --> 51:56.260
 than I do because pigeons know to keep their head back

51:56.260 --> 51:57.940
 as they walk forward.

51:57.940 --> 52:02.520
 All right, so that gets us to this issue of motion sickness.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.660
 And you don't have to go out on a boat.

52:05.660 --> 52:08.100
 Anytime I go to New York, I sit in an Uber

52:08.100 --> 52:11.820
 or in a cab in the back, and if I'm looking at my phone

52:11.820 --> 52:14.580
 while the car is driving, I feel nauseous

52:14.580 --> 52:17.020
 by time I arrive at my destination.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.380
 I always try and look out the front of the windshield

52:19.380 --> 52:22.800
 because I'm told that helps, but it's a little tiny window.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.960
 And I end up feeling slightly less sick if I do that.

52:26.960 --> 52:31.960
 So what's going on with the vision and the balance system

52:32.240 --> 52:34.300
 that causes a kind of a nausea?

52:34.300 --> 52:35.820
 And actually, if I keep talking about this,

52:35.820 --> 52:37.220
 I probably will get sick.

52:37.220 --> 52:40.700
 I don't throw up easily, but for some reason,

52:40.700 --> 52:42.540
 motion sickness is a real thing for me.

52:42.540 --> 52:44.300
 It's a problem for a lot of people.

52:44.300 --> 52:47.080
 I mean, I think the fundamental problem typically

52:47.080 --> 52:49.900
 when you get motion sick is what they call

52:49.900 --> 52:52.720
 visual vestibular conflict.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.300
 That is, you have two sensory systems

52:55.300 --> 52:56.460
 that are talking to your brain

52:56.460 --> 52:58.460
 about how you're moving through the world.

52:58.460 --> 53:02.380
 And as long as they agree, you're fine.

53:02.380 --> 53:06.260
 So if you're driving, your body senses

53:06.260 --> 53:07.100
 that you're moving forward.

53:07.100 --> 53:10.680
 Your vestibular systems is picking up this acceleration

53:10.680 --> 53:14.900
 of the car, and your visual system is seeing the consequences

53:14.900 --> 53:19.340
 of forward motion in the sweeping of the scene past you.

53:19.340 --> 53:20.860
 Everything is honky-dory, right?

53:20.860 --> 53:22.140
 No problem.

53:22.140 --> 53:25.580
 But when you are headed forward,

53:25.580 --> 53:26.860
 but you're looking at your cell phone,

53:26.860 --> 53:28.020
 what is your retina seeing?

53:28.020 --> 53:30.300
 Your retina is seeing the stable image of the screen.

53:30.300 --> 53:33.540
 There's absolutely no motion in that screen.

53:33.540 --> 53:35.740
 Or the motion is, or some other motion,

53:35.740 --> 53:36.580
 like a movie or, yeah. Or it's a motion

53:36.580 --> 53:37.940
 you're watching if you're playing a game

53:37.940 --> 53:40.380
 or you're watching a video, a football game.

53:40.380 --> 53:41.700
 Or the motion is uncoupled

53:41.700 --> 53:44.340
 with what's actually happening to your body.

53:44.340 --> 53:45.620
 Your brain doesn't like that.

53:45.620 --> 53:48.320
 Your brain likes everything to be aligned.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.620
 And if it's not, it's going to complain to you.

53:50.620 --> 53:51.460
 By making me feel nauseous.

53:51.460 --> 53:52.460
 By making you feel nauseous,

53:52.460 --> 53:53.900
 and maybe you'll change your behavior.

53:53.900 --> 53:54.820
 So you're getting-

53:54.820 --> 53:55.860
 I'm getting punished.

53:55.860 --> 53:58.020
 Yeah, for setting it up

53:58.020 --> 53:59.780
 so you're a signal second flick, right.

53:59.780 --> 54:04.780
 By the vestibular visuals in time.

54:05.060 --> 54:06.440
 I love it.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.580
 I love the idea of reward signals.

54:08.580 --> 54:10.700
 And we've done a lot of discussion about this

54:10.700 --> 54:13.120
 on this podcast of things like dopamine reward and things,

54:13.120 --> 54:14.560
 but also punishment signals.

54:14.560 --> 54:17.120
 And I love this example.

54:17.980 --> 54:20.420
 Well, maybe marching a little bit further

54:20.420 --> 54:21.580
 along this pathway,

54:22.860 --> 54:25.880
 visual input is combined with balance input.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.340
 Where does that occur?

54:28.340 --> 54:32.140
 And maybe, because I have some hint of where it occurs,

54:32.140 --> 54:34.220
 you could tell us a little bit about this

54:34.220 --> 54:37.540
 kind of mysterious little mini brain

54:37.540 --> 54:38.700
 that they call the cerebellum.

54:38.700 --> 54:40.100
 Cerebellum, yeah.

54:40.100 --> 54:43.780
 So, you know, the way I tried to describe the cerebellum

54:43.780 --> 54:48.780
 to my students is that it serves sort of like

54:49.100 --> 54:53.320
 the air traffic control system functions in air travel.

54:54.500 --> 54:57.560
 So that it's a system that's very complicated

54:57.560 --> 55:01.060
 and it's really dependent on great information.

55:01.060 --> 55:02.620
 So it's taking in the information

55:02.620 --> 55:04.620
 about everything that's happening everywhere,

55:04.620 --> 55:07.660
 not only through your sensory systems,

55:07.660 --> 55:10.100
 but it's listening into all the little centers

55:10.100 --> 55:11.700
 elsewhere in your brain that are computing

55:11.700 --> 55:13.580
 what you're gonna be doing next and so forth.

55:13.580 --> 55:15.780
 So it's just ravenous for that kind of information.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.700
 So it really is like a little mini brain.

55:17.700 --> 55:21.740
 It is, it's got access to all of the signals

55:23.580 --> 55:25.460
 and it really has an important role

55:25.460 --> 55:29.860
 in coordinating and shaping movements.

55:29.860 --> 55:34.540
 But, you know, if you suddenly eliminated the air traffic

55:34.540 --> 55:38.940
 control system, planes could still take off and land,

55:38.940 --> 55:43.940
 but you might have some unhappy accidents in the process.

55:44.100 --> 55:45.860
 So the cerebellum is kind of like that.

55:45.860 --> 55:48.140
 It's not that you would be paralyzed

55:48.140 --> 55:49.900
 if your cerebellum was gone

55:49.900 --> 55:51.380
 because you still have motor neurons,

55:51.380 --> 55:54.100
 you still have ways to talk to your muscles,

55:54.100 --> 55:56.420
 you still have reflex centers,

55:56.420 --> 55:59.800
 and it's not like you would have any sensory loss

55:59.800 --> 56:01.460
 because you still have your cortex

56:01.460 --> 56:03.020
 getting all of those beautiful signals

56:03.020 --> 56:05.020
 that you can think about,

56:05.020 --> 56:09.420
 but you wouldn't be coordinating things so well anymore.

56:09.420 --> 56:12.900
 The timing between input and output might be off.

56:12.900 --> 56:16.700
 Or if you were trying to practice a new athletic move,

56:16.700 --> 56:19.300
 like an overhead serve in tennis,

56:19.300 --> 56:21.420
 you'd be just terrible at learning.

56:22.660 --> 56:25.260
 But all of the sequences of muscle movements

56:25.260 --> 56:27.360
 and the feedback from your sensory apparatus

56:27.360 --> 56:29.380
 that would let you really get that ball

56:29.380 --> 56:33.140
 exactly where you want it to after the nth rep, right now,

56:33.140 --> 56:36.060
 the thousandth rep or something, you get much better at it.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.460
 So the cerebellum is all involved in things like

56:40.000 --> 56:44.340
 motor learning and refining the precisions of movement

56:44.340 --> 56:47.180
 so that they get you where you want to go.

56:47.180 --> 56:49.900
 If you reach for a glass of champagne

56:49.900 --> 56:52.160
 that you don't knock it over or stop short.

56:53.620 --> 56:54.540
 You know, that's what it's good at.

56:54.540 --> 56:57.260
 People who have selective damage to the cerebellum.

56:57.260 --> 56:58.100
 Absolutely.

56:58.100 --> 57:00.660
 And what I come familiar with,

57:01.980 --> 57:04.420
 well, Korsakoff's is different, right?

57:04.420 --> 57:06.220
 Isn't that a B vitamin deficiency from,

57:06.220 --> 57:07.540
 in chronic alcoholics?

57:07.540 --> 57:08.380
 Right.

57:08.380 --> 57:10.100
 And they have a, they tend to walk kind of bow-legged

57:10.100 --> 57:11.820
 and they can't coordinate their movements.

57:11.820 --> 57:13.420
 Is that, that has some that-

57:13.420 --> 57:14.240
 Not sure about the cerebellar.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.420
 Mammary bodies, but also cerebellum.

57:16.420 --> 57:19.020
 I'm not sure about the cerebellar involvement there,

57:19.020 --> 57:21.980
 but you know, the typical thing would be

57:23.420 --> 57:26.660
 a patient who has a cerebellar stroke or a tumor,

57:26.660 --> 57:31.660
 for example, might be not that steady on their feet.

57:32.580 --> 57:37.340
 You know, if the, you know, dynamics of the situation

57:37.340 --> 57:40.840
 is standing on a street car with no pole to hold onto,

57:40.840 --> 57:42.980
 they might not be as good at adjusting

57:42.980 --> 57:45.380
 all of the little movements of the car.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.340
 You know, there's a kind of tremor that can occur

57:49.340 --> 57:50.940
 as they're reaching for things

57:52.020 --> 57:53.580
 because they reach a little too far

57:53.580 --> 57:57.500
 and then they over-correct and come back, things like that.

57:57.500 --> 58:02.500
 So it's very common neurological phenomenon, actually.

58:03.700 --> 58:07.260
 Cerebellar ataxia, this is what the neurologists call it.

58:07.260 --> 58:09.140
 And it can happen not just with cerebellar damage,

58:09.140 --> 58:11.420
 but damage to the tracks that feed the information

58:11.420 --> 58:12.260
 into the cerebellum.

58:12.260 --> 58:13.340
 Right, just to provide the structure.

58:13.340 --> 58:15.500
 Exactly, or output from the cerebellum.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.860
 And so the cerebellum is where a lot of visual

58:17.860 --> 58:19.900
 and balance information is combined.

58:19.900 --> 58:21.940
 In a very key place in the cerebellum,

58:21.940 --> 58:26.280
 which is, it's really one of the oldest parts

58:26.280 --> 58:27.120
 in terms of evolution.

58:27.120 --> 58:27.940
 Talking about the flocculus.

58:27.940 --> 58:28.780
 The flocculus, right.

58:28.780 --> 58:32.180
 This is a, it's a critical place in the cerebellum

58:32.180 --> 58:35.140
 where visual and vestibular information comes together

58:35.140 --> 58:37.260
 recording just the kinds of movements

58:37.260 --> 58:40.360
 we were talking about, this image stabilizing network.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.860
 It's all happening there.

58:41.860 --> 58:43.620
 And there's learning happening there as well.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.900
 So that if your vestibular apparatus

58:45.900 --> 58:48.840
 is a little bit damaged somehow,

58:48.840 --> 58:52.800
 your visual system is actually talking to your cerebellum

58:52.800 --> 58:55.860
 saying there's a problem here, there's an error.

58:55.860 --> 58:58.820
 And your cerebellum is learning to do better

58:58.820 --> 59:01.260
 by increasing the output of the vestibular system

59:01.260 --> 59:03.680
 to compensate for whatever that loss was.

59:03.680 --> 59:05.340
 So it's a little error correction system.

59:05.340 --> 59:08.380
 That's sort of typical of a cerebellar function.

59:08.380 --> 59:10.180
 And it can happen in many, many different domains.

59:10.180 --> 59:11.900
 This is just one of the domains

59:11.900 --> 59:15.300
 of sensory motor integration that takes place there.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.700
 So I should stay off my phone in the Ubers.

59:18.700 --> 59:22.300
 If I'm on a boat, I should essentially look

59:22.300 --> 59:25.760
 and as much as possible act as if I'm driving the machine.

59:25.760 --> 59:26.600
 Right.

59:26.600 --> 59:28.180
 That'd be weird if I was in the passenger seat

59:28.180 --> 59:29.480
 pretending I was driving the machine,

59:29.480 --> 59:30.660
 but I do always feel better

59:30.660 --> 59:32.700
 if I'm sitting in the front seat passenger.

59:32.700 --> 59:33.540
 Right.

59:33.540 --> 59:35.780
 The more of the visual world that you can see

59:35.780 --> 59:38.380
 as if you were actually the one doing the motion,

59:38.380 --> 59:39.420
 I would think.

59:39.420 --> 59:41.020
 Let's stay in the inner ear for a minute

59:41.020 --> 59:44.400
 as we continue to march around the nervous system.

59:46.380 --> 59:48.500
 When you take off in the plane or when you land

59:48.500 --> 59:50.060
 or sometimes in the middle of there,

59:50.060 --> 59:53.260
 your ears get clogged, or at least my ears get clogged.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.300
 That's because of pressure buildup

59:56.300 --> 59:59.340
 in the various tubes of the inner ear, et cetera.

59:59.340 --> 1:00:00.220
 We'll get into this.

1:00:00.220 --> 1:00:05.100
 But years ago, our good friend, Harvey Carton,

1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:08.220
 who's another world-class neuroanatomist,

1:00:09.900 --> 1:00:12.140
 gave a lecture and it talked about

1:00:12.140 --> 1:00:14.420
 how plugging your nose and blowing out

1:00:14.420 --> 1:00:17.420
 versus plugging your nose and sucking in

1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:20.100
 can, should be done at different times

1:00:20.100 --> 1:00:23.600
 depending on whether or not you're taking off or landing.

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:26.380
 And I always see people trying to un-pop their ears.

1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:27.220
 Right.

1:00:27.220 --> 1:00:28.340
 And when you do scuba diving,

1:00:28.340 --> 1:00:30.300
 you learn how to do this without necessarily,

1:00:30.300 --> 1:00:32.860
 I can do it by just kind of moving my jaw now

1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:35.480
 because I've done a little bit of diving.

1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:37.700
 But what's the story there?

1:00:37.700 --> 1:00:39.740
 We don't have to get into all the differences

1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:41.140
 in atmospheric pressure, et cetera.

1:00:41.140 --> 1:00:44.300
 But if I'm taking off and my ears are plugged,

1:00:44.300 --> 1:00:46.460
 or I've recently ascended, plane took off,

1:00:46.460 --> 1:00:47.300
 my ears are plugged.

1:00:47.300 --> 1:00:48.540
 Do I plug my nose and blow out

1:00:48.540 --> 1:00:49.960
 or do I plug my nose and suck in?

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:54.960
 Right, so the basic idea is that if your ears feel bad

1:00:55.100 --> 1:00:58.620
 because you're going into an area of higher pressure,

1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:01.980
 so if they pressurize the cabin more than the pressure

1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:03.760
 that you have on the surface of the planet,

1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:07.020
 your eardrums will be bending in and they don't like that.

1:01:07.020 --> 1:01:08.660
 If you push them more, they'll hurt even more.

1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:11.620
 That's a good description that the pressure goes up,

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:12.580
 then they're gonna bend in.

1:01:12.580 --> 1:01:14.660
 Bend in, and then the reverse would be true

1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:16.640
 if you go into an area of low pressure.

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:20.180
 So if you started to drive up the mountainside,

1:01:20.180 --> 1:01:22.160
 the pressure is getting lower and lower outside.

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.900
 Now the air behind your eardrum is blooming out, right?

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:28.720
 So it's just a question of are you trying to get

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:31.500
 more pressure or less pressure behind the eardrum?

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:32.820
 And there's a little tube that does that

1:01:32.820 --> 1:01:35.580
 and comes down into the back of your throat there.

1:01:35.580 --> 1:01:37.620
 And if you force pressure up that tube,

1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:39.540
 you're gonna be putting more air pressure

1:01:39.540 --> 1:01:44.540
 into the compartment to counter it, if it's not enough.

1:01:44.740 --> 1:01:46.500
 And if you're sucking, you're going the other way.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:49.100
 In reality, I think as long as you open the passageway,

1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:50.780
 I think the pressure differential

1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:52.220
 is gonna solve your problem.

1:01:52.220 --> 1:01:54.220
 So I think you could actually blow in

1:01:54.220 --> 1:01:55.960
 when you're not, quote, supposed to.

1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:00.180
 Okay, so you could just hold your nose and blow air out

1:02:00.180 --> 1:02:04.100
 or hold your nose and suck in the effect.

1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:05.020
 Either way is fine.

1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:05.860
 I think so.

1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:09.100
 Excellent, I just won $100 from Harvey Carton.

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:10.500
 Thank you very much.

1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:12.800
 Harvey and I used to teach in our anatomy together.

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:14.900
 And I'll say, I don't think it matters, but thank you.

1:02:14.900 --> 1:02:16.780
 I'll split that with you.

1:02:16.780 --> 1:02:17.600
 Okay.

1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:21.940
 This is important stuff, but it's true.

1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:25.140
 You hear this, so it doesn't matter either way.

1:02:25.140 --> 1:02:26.860
 Yeah, I'm no expert in this area.

1:02:26.860 --> 1:02:27.860
 Don't worry. Don't quote me.

1:02:27.860 --> 1:02:30.540
 He's not gonna, well, I'm going to quote you, but okay.

1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:32.140
 So we've talked about the inner ear

1:02:32.140 --> 1:02:33.960
 and we've talked about the cerebellum.

1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:35.740
 I want to talk about an area of the brain

1:02:35.740 --> 1:02:39.340
 that is rarely discussed, which is the midbrain.

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:40.180
 Yeah.

1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:42.820
 And for those that don't know,

1:02:42.820 --> 1:02:45.620
 the midbrain is an area beneath the cortex.

1:02:45.620 --> 1:02:47.180
 I guess we never really defined cortex.

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:48.500
 It was just kind of the outer layers

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:52.740
 or the outer layers of the least mammalian brain

1:02:52.740 --> 1:02:53.580
 or human brain.

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:57.140
 But the midbrain is super interesting

1:02:57.140 --> 1:03:02.140
 because it controls a lot of unconscious stuff,

1:03:02.420 --> 1:03:03.860
 reflexes, et cetera.

1:03:05.060 --> 1:03:07.900
 And then there's this phenomenon even called blindsight.

1:03:07.900 --> 1:03:11.320
 So could you please tell us about the midbrain,

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.660
 about what it does and what in the world is blindsight?

1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:19.500
 Yeah, so there's a lot of pieces there.

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:22.700
 I think the first thing to say is if you imagine

1:03:22.700 --> 1:03:25.260
 the nervous system in your mind's eye,

1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:27.100
 you see this big honking brain

1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:32.100
 and then there's this little wand that dangles down

1:03:32.260 --> 1:03:34.540
 into your vertebral column, the spinal cord,

1:03:34.540 --> 1:03:36.600
 and that's kind of your visual impression.

1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:40.100
 What you have to imagine is starting in the spinal cord

1:03:40.100 --> 1:03:42.740
 and working your way up into this big, magnificent brain.

1:03:42.740 --> 1:03:46.440
 And what you would do as you enter the skull

1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:48.980
 is get into a little place where the spinal cord

1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:50.220
 kind of thickens out.

1:03:50.220 --> 1:03:54.860
 It still has that sort of long, skinny, trunk-like feeling.

1:03:54.860 --> 1:03:56.700
 Sort of like a paddle or a spoon shape.

1:03:56.700 --> 1:03:58.540
 Right, it starts to spread out a little bit

1:03:58.540 --> 1:04:00.520
 and that's because your evolution has packed

1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.100
 more interesting goodies in there

1:04:02.100 --> 1:04:05.340
 for processing information and generating movement.

1:04:05.340 --> 1:04:09.780
 So beyond that is this tween brain.

1:04:09.780 --> 1:04:12.220
 You were talking about this link, this linker brain.

1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:14.860
 Diencephalon really means the between brain.

1:04:14.860 --> 1:04:16.060
 Oh, I thought you said tween.

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:16.900
 Well, it is, yes.

1:04:16.900 --> 1:04:18.420
 No, no, between, between.

1:04:18.420 --> 1:04:19.780
 Sorry, I thought you said tween.

1:04:19.780 --> 1:04:22.460
 Yeah, it's the between, it's the between brain

1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:24.340
 is what the name means.

1:04:24.340 --> 1:04:27.780
 It's the linker from the spinal cord in the periphery

1:04:27.780 --> 1:04:30.420
 up to these grand centers of the cortex.

1:04:30.420 --> 1:04:33.340
 But this midbrain you're talking about

1:04:33.340 --> 1:04:37.280
 is the last bit of this enlarged sort of spinal cord-y thing

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:39.540
 in your skull, which is really the brainstem

1:04:39.540 --> 1:04:40.980
 is what we call it.

1:04:40.980 --> 1:04:43.900
 The last bit of that before you get to this relay

1:04:43.900 --> 1:04:46.980
 up to the cortex is the midbrain.

1:04:46.980 --> 1:04:49.580
 And there's a really important visual center there.

1:04:49.580 --> 1:04:51.540
 It's called the superior colliculus.

1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:54.580
 There's a similar center in the brains

1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:56.380
 of other vertebrate animals.

1:04:56.380 --> 1:04:59.060
 A frog, for example, or a lizard would have this.

1:04:59.060 --> 1:05:01.420
 It's called the optic tectum there.

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:06.420
 But it's a center that in these non-mammalian vertebrates

1:05:06.420 --> 1:05:08.360
 is really the main visual center.

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.960
 They don't really have what we would call a visual cortex,

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:14.080
 although there's something sort of like that.

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:15.560
 But this is where most of the action is

1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:17.680
 in terms of interpreting visual input

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:20.560
 and organizing behavior around that.

1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:25.440
 You can sort of think about this region of the brainstem

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:30.440
 as a reflex center that can reorient the animal's gaze

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.600
 or body, or maybe even attention,

1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:39.400
 or maybe even attention to particular regions of space

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:41.600
 out there around the animal.

1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:43.540
 And that could be for all kinds of reasons.

1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:45.780
 I mean, it might be a predator just showed up

1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:48.520
 in one corner of the forest and you pick that up

1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:50.000
 and you're trying to avoid it.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.040
 Or just any movement.

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.400
 Many movement, right?

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:57.320
 It might be that suddenly something splats on the page

1:05:57.320 --> 1:05:58.560
 when you're reading a novel

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:02.080
 and your eye reflexly looks at it.

1:06:02.080 --> 1:06:03.240
 You don't have to think about that.

1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:04.200
 That's a reflex.

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:07.320
 What if you throw me a ball, but I'm not expecting it,

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:10.720
 and I just reach up and try and grab it, catch it or not?

1:06:10.720 --> 1:06:12.320
 Is that handled by the midbrain?

1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:14.960
 Well, that's probably not the midbrain,

1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:17.120
 although, I mean, by itself,

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:19.720
 because it's going to involve all these limb movements,

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:21.520
 this movement of your arm and body.

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:25.680
 What about ducking if something's suddenly thrown at my head?

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:26.500
 Sure, right.

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.000
 Things like that will certainly have a brainstem component,

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.760
 a midbrain component.

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:32.300
 Something looms and you duck.

1:06:32.300 --> 1:06:35.740
 It may not be the superior colliculus we're talking about.

1:06:35.740 --> 1:06:38.140
 Now, it might be another part of the visual midbrain,

1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:40.700
 but these are centers that emerged early

1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:42.900
 in the evolution of brains like ours

1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:45.740
 to handle complicated visual events

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:47.940
 that have significance for the animal.

1:06:47.940 --> 1:06:50.620
 In terms of space, where is it in space?

1:06:50.620 --> 1:06:53.340
 And in fact, this same center actually gets input

1:06:53.340 --> 1:06:55.220
 from all kinds of other sensory systems

1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:57.820
 that take information from the external world,

1:06:57.820 --> 1:06:59.540
 from particular locations,

1:06:59.540 --> 1:07:01.340
 and where you might want to either avoid

1:07:01.340 --> 1:07:04.660
 or approach things according to their significance to you.

1:07:04.660 --> 1:07:07.740
 So, you get input from the touch system.

1:07:07.740 --> 1:07:10.540
 You get input from the auditory system.

1:07:10.540 --> 1:07:12.460
 I worked for a while in rattlesnakes.

1:07:12.460 --> 1:07:16.740
 They get input from a part of their warm sensors

1:07:16.740 --> 1:07:17.580
 on their face.

1:07:17.580 --> 1:07:19.500
 They're in these little pits on the face.

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.260
 They used to work on baby rattlesnakes, right?

1:07:21.260 --> 1:07:23.020
 Well, they were adults, actually.

1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:24.660
 Oh, I wasn't trying to diminish the danger.

1:07:24.660 --> 1:07:26.340
 I thought for some reason they were little ones.

1:07:26.340 --> 1:07:27.180
 No.

1:07:27.180 --> 1:07:29.300
 Why in the world would you work on rattlesnakes?

1:07:29.300 --> 1:07:32.780
 Well, because they have a version

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:34.980
 of an extra receptive sensory system.

1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:38.020
 That is, they're looking out into the world

1:07:38.020 --> 1:07:40.060
 using a completely different set of sensors.

1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:41.300
 They're using the same sensors

1:07:41.300 --> 1:07:42.980
 that would feel the warmth on your face

1:07:42.980 --> 1:07:44.900
 if you stood in front of a bonfire,

1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:47.420
 except evolution has given them

1:07:47.420 --> 1:07:48.980
 this very nice specialized system

1:07:48.980 --> 1:07:51.260
 that lets them image where the heat's coming from.

1:07:51.260 --> 1:07:52.940
 You can sort of do that anyway, right?

1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:55.260
 If you walk around the fire,

1:07:55.260 --> 1:07:59.260
 you can feel where the fire is from the heat coming in.

1:07:59.260 --> 1:08:00.460
 It's hitting your face.

1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:04.300
 Is that the primary way in which they detect prey?

1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:06.660
 It's one of the major ways.

1:08:06.660 --> 1:08:09.100
 And in fact, they use vision as well.

1:08:09.100 --> 1:08:11.100
 And they bring these two systems together

1:08:11.100 --> 1:08:13.660
 in the same place, in this tectum region,

1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:15.340
 this brain stem, midbrain region.

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:17.580
 What's all the tongue jutting about when the snakes?

1:08:17.580 --> 1:08:19.080
 That I don't know.

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:20.380
 That may be olfactory.

1:08:20.380 --> 1:08:21.220
 There may be-

1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:22.220
 They're sniffing the air with their tongue?

1:08:22.220 --> 1:08:23.060
 Yeah, there may be-

1:08:23.060 --> 1:08:24.780
 Early air in our drive,

1:08:24.780 --> 1:08:27.020
 you told me that flies actually taste things

1:08:27.020 --> 1:08:27.860
 with their feet.

1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:28.700
 They do, yeah.

1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:29.540
 That's so weird.

1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:33.300
 Yeah, they have taste receptors in lots of funny places.

1:08:33.300 --> 1:08:34.920
 I want to pause here just for one second

1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:36.500
 before we get back into the midbrain.

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:40.120
 I think what's so interesting in all seriousness

1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:45.040
 about taste receptors on feet, heat sensors,

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:47.660
 tongues jutting out of snakes,

1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:49.360
 and vision and all this integration

1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:51.980
 is that it really speaks to the fact

1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:55.020
 that all these sensory neurons

1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:57.820
 are trying to gather information

1:08:57.820 --> 1:08:59.740
 and stuff it into a system

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:03.300
 that can make meaningful decisions and actions.

1:09:03.300 --> 1:09:04.660
 And that it really doesn't matter

1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:06.720
 whether or not it's coming from eyes or ears or nose

1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:08.540
 or bottoms of feet,

1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:11.500
 because in the end it's just electricity flowing in.

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:14.900
 And so it sounds like it's placed on each animal.

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:17.340
 It's always feels weird to call fly an animal,

1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:19.540
 but they are creatures.

1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:20.440
 They are animals.

1:09:21.420 --> 1:09:23.780
 It's placed in different locations on different animals,

1:09:23.780 --> 1:09:26.700
 depending on the particular needs of that animal.

1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:29.180
 Right, but how much more powerful

1:09:29.180 --> 1:09:32.860
 if the nervous systems can also cross-correlate

1:09:32.860 --> 1:09:34.960
 across sensory systems?

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:38.140
 So if you've got a weak signal from one sensory system,

1:09:38.140 --> 1:09:40.360
 you're not quite sure there's something there.

1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:43.020
 And a weak signal from another sensory system

1:09:43.020 --> 1:09:44.820
 that's telling you the same locations

1:09:44.820 --> 1:09:46.340
 is a little bit interesting.

1:09:46.340 --> 1:09:47.780
 There might be something there.

1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:50.540
 If you've got those two together, you've got corroboration.

1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:53.140
 Your brain now says it's much more likely

1:09:53.140 --> 1:09:55.720
 that that's gonna be something

1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:56.900
 worth paying attention to.

1:09:56.900 --> 1:09:59.580
 Right, so maybe I'm feeling some heat

1:09:59.580 --> 1:10:01.140
 on one side of my face

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:05.860
 and I also smell something baking in the oven.

1:10:05.860 --> 1:10:08.220
 So now neither is particularly strong,

1:10:08.220 --> 1:10:10.420
 but as you said, there's some corroboration

1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:12.500
 and that corroboration is occurring in the midbrain.

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:16.000
 Right, and then if you throw things into conflict,

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:17.340
 now the brain is confused

1:10:17.340 --> 1:10:20.040
 and that may be where your motion sickness comes from.

1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:23.020
 So it's great to have, as a brain,

1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:24.780
 it's great to have as many sources of information

1:10:24.780 --> 1:10:28.580
 as you can have, just like if you're a spy

1:10:28.580 --> 1:10:30.620
 or a journalist, you don't want as much information

1:10:30.620 --> 1:10:33.080
 as you can get about what's out there.

1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:35.660
 But if things conflict, that's problematic, right?

1:10:35.660 --> 1:10:37.340
 Your sources are giving you different information

1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:38.520
 about what's going on.

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:39.860
 Now you've got a problem on your hands.

1:10:39.860 --> 1:10:40.860
 What do you publish?

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.540
 The midbrain is so fascinating.

1:10:43.540 --> 1:10:46.340
 I don't wanna eject us from the midbrain

1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:47.860
 and go back to the vestibular system,

1:10:47.860 --> 1:10:49.680
 but I do have a question that I forgot to ask

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:50.780
 about the vestibular system,

1:10:50.780 --> 1:10:53.820
 which is why is it that for many people, including me,

1:10:53.820 --> 1:10:56.420
 there's despite my motion sickness in cabs,

1:10:56.420 --> 1:11:00.820
 that there's a sense of pleasure in moving through space

1:11:00.820 --> 1:11:02.260
 and getting tilted relative

1:11:02.260 --> 1:11:04.180
 to the gravitational pull of the earth.

1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:05.680
 For me growing up, it was skateboarding,

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:08.800
 but people like to corner in cars, corner on bikes.

1:11:10.140 --> 1:11:13.340
 It may be for some people it's done running or dance,

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:16.300
 but what is it about moving through space

1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:19.680
 and getting tilted, a lot of surfers around here,

1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:24.680
 getting tilted that can tap into some of the pleasure centers?

1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:26.900
 Do we have any idea why that would feel good?

1:11:26.900 --> 1:11:28.620
 I have no clue.

1:11:28.620 --> 1:11:31.460
 Is there a dopaminergic input to this system?

1:11:31.460 --> 1:11:36.220
 Well, the dopaminergic system gets a lot of places.

1:11:37.020 --> 1:11:40.300
 It's pretty much, to some extent,

1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:41.340
 everywhere in the cortex,

1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.500
 a lot more in the frontal lobe, of course,

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:45.880
 but that's just for starters.

1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:47.900
 I mean, there's basically dopaminergic innervation

1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:50.300
 in most places in the central nervous system,

1:11:50.300 --> 1:11:52.720
 so there's the potential for dopaminergic involvement,

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:55.820
 but I really have no clue about the tilting phenomenon.

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:58.020
 People pay money to go on roller coasters.

1:11:58.020 --> 1:11:58.860
 Right.

1:11:58.860 --> 1:12:00.660
 Well, I think that may be as much about the thrill

1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:01.500
 as anything else.

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:05.140
 Sure, and the falling reflex is very robust in all of us.

1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:07.180
 When the visual world's going up very fast,

1:12:07.180 --> 1:12:08.900
 it usually means that we're falling,

1:12:08.900 --> 1:12:10.740
 but in some people like that, some people don't.

1:12:10.740 --> 1:12:14.660
 Right, and kids tolerate a lot more

1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:16.740
 sort of vestibular craziness spinning around

1:12:16.740 --> 1:12:18.460
 until they drop.

1:12:18.460 --> 1:12:21.420
 Well, I've friends, it always, you know,

1:12:21.420 --> 1:12:23.620
 worries me a little bit that they throw their kids.

1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:25.000
 I'm not recommending anyone do this.

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:25.860
 When they're little kids, you know,

1:12:25.860 --> 1:12:28.980
 like throwing the kids really far back and forth,

1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:30.420
 some kids seem to love it.

1:12:30.420 --> 1:12:31.260
 Yeah.

1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:33.900
 Yeah, our son loved being shaken up and down

1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:37.220
 very, very vigorously.

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:39.280
 That's the only thing that would calm him down sometimes.

1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:40.280
 Interesting.

1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:43.820
 Yeah, so I'm guessing, we can guess

1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:47.460
 that maybe there's some activation of the reward systems

1:12:47.460 --> 1:12:50.220
 from moving through space.

1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:51.860
 Well, I mean, if you think about, you know,

1:12:51.860 --> 1:12:54.820
 how rewarding it is to be able to move through space

1:12:54.820 --> 1:12:57.940
 and how unhappy people are who are used to that,

1:12:57.940 --> 1:12:59.700
 who suddenly aren't able to do that,

1:12:59.700 --> 1:13:01.740
 there is a sense of agency, right?

1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:05.260
 If you can choose to move through the world and to tilt,

1:13:05.260 --> 1:13:06.800
 that's not only you're moving through the world,

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:08.460
 but you're doing it with a certain amount of finesse.

1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:09.340
 Maybe that's what it is.

1:13:09.340 --> 1:13:13.280
 You can feel like you're the master of your own movement

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.180
 in a way that you wouldn't if you're going straight.

1:13:15.180 --> 1:13:17.180
 I'm just blowing smoke here, right?

1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:18.460
 Yeah, well, we can speculate.

1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:19.300
 That's fine.

1:13:19.300 --> 1:13:21.440
 I couldn't help but ask the question.

1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:25.040
 Okay, so if we move ourselves, pun intended,

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:27.260
 back into the midbrain,

1:13:27.260 --> 1:13:29.120
 the midbrain's combining all these different signals

1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.180
 for reflexive action.

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:34.920
 At what point does this become deliberate action?

1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:36.780
 Because if I look at something I want

1:13:36.780 --> 1:13:39.180
 and I want to pursue it, I'm going to go toward it.

1:13:39.180 --> 1:13:42.360
 And many times that's a deliberate decision.

1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:43.200
 Right.

1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:46.700
 So this gets very slippery, I think,

1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:49.300
 because what you have to try to imagine

1:13:49.300 --> 1:13:51.020
 is all these different parts of the brain

1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:53.980
 working on the problem of staying alive

1:13:56.220 --> 1:13:59.020
 and surviving in the world.

1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:01.120
 They're working on the problem simultaneously.

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:04.960
 And there's not one right answer to how to do that.

1:14:06.300 --> 1:14:09.880
 But one way to think about it is that

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:11.760
 you have high levels of your nervous system

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:16.100
 that are very well designed to override

1:14:16.100 --> 1:14:19.580
 an otherwise automatic movement if it's inappropriate.

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:20.420
 So if you've imagined,

1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:23.740
 you've been invited to tea with the queen

1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:28.740
 and she hands you a very fancy Wedgwood tea cup, very thin.

1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:30.860
 Wedgwood tea cup.

1:14:30.860 --> 1:14:33.020
 Yes, with very hot tea in it

1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:34.100
 and you're burning your hand,

1:14:34.100 --> 1:14:36.160
 you probably will try to find a way

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:37.620
 to put that back down on the saucer

1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:40.140
 rather than just dropping it on the floor

1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:42.780
 because you're with the queen.

1:14:42.780 --> 1:14:45.520
 You're trying to be appropriate to that.

1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:49.380
 So you have ways of reining in automatic behaviors

1:14:49.380 --> 1:14:51.180
 if they're gonna be maladaptive.

1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:54.580
 But you also want the reflex to work quickly

1:14:54.580 --> 1:14:56.060
 if it's the only thing that's gonna save you,

1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:58.340
 the looming object coming at your head.

1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.300
 You don't have time to think about that.

1:15:00.300 --> 1:15:01.900
 So this is the interplay

1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:05.260
 in these hierarchically organized centers

1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:06.100
 of the nervous system.

1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:09.500
 At the lowest level, you've got the automatic sensors

1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:14.460
 and centers and reflex arcs that will keep you safe

1:15:14.460 --> 1:15:16.700
 even if you don't have time to think about it.

1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:18.700
 And then you've got the higher center saying,

1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:20.600
 well, maybe we could do this as well

1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:23.460
 or maybe we shouldn't do that at all, right?

1:15:23.460 --> 1:15:25.660
 So you have all of these different levels

1:15:25.660 --> 1:15:27.500
 operating simultaneously

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:30.580
 and you need bi-directional communication

1:15:30.580 --> 1:15:34.580
 between high level cognitive centers,

1:15:34.580 --> 1:15:37.700
 decision-making on the one hand

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:40.260
 and these low level, very helpful reflexive centers,

1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:43.420
 but they're a little bit rigid, a little hardwired,

1:15:43.420 --> 1:15:44.500
 so they need some nuance.

1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:47.380
 So both of these things are operating in tandem,

1:15:47.380 --> 1:15:49.820
 in real time, all the time in our brains.

1:15:49.820 --> 1:15:51.740
 And sometimes we listen more to one than the other.

1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:53.940
 You've heard people in sports talking about

1:15:55.020 --> 1:15:57.520
 messing up at the plate because they overthought it,

1:15:57.520 --> 1:15:58.980
 thinking too hard about it.

1:15:58.980 --> 1:16:01.860
 That's partly, you've already trained your cerebellum

1:16:01.860 --> 1:16:04.940
 how to hit a fastball right down the middle.

1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:08.060
 Right, and if you start looking for something new

1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:11.100
 or different, you're going to mess up your reflexive swing.

1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:12.920
 Right, if you're trying to think about the physics

1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:14.980
 of the ball as it's coming at you,

1:16:14.980 --> 1:16:16.340
 you've already missed, right?

1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:18.740
 Because you're not using your,

1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:22.220
 all those reps have built a kind of knowledge

1:16:22.220 --> 1:16:23.660
 is what you want to rely on

1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:27.100
 when you don't have enough time to contemplate.

1:16:28.180 --> 1:16:30.300
 This is important and a great segue

1:16:30.300 --> 1:16:32.960
 for what I'd like to discuss next,

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:35.880
 which is the basal ganglia.

1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:38.200
 This really interesting area of the brain

1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:43.200
 that's involved in go type commands and behaviors,

1:16:43.500 --> 1:16:46.460
 instructing us to do things and no go,

1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:47.760
 preventing us from doing things.

1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:50.700
 Because so much of motor learning and skill execution

1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:55.660
 and not saying the wrong thing or sitting still in class

1:16:55.660 --> 1:16:57.920
 or as you used with the, you know,

1:16:57.920 --> 1:16:59.480
 tea with the queen example,

1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:03.900
 feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior.

1:17:03.900 --> 1:17:05.820
 And sometimes it's activating behavior.

1:17:05.820 --> 1:17:07.420
 A tremendous amount of online attention

1:17:07.420 --> 1:17:11.220
 is devoted to trying to get people motivated.

1:17:11.220 --> 1:17:13.320
 You know, this isn't the main focus of our podcast.

1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:15.060
 We touch on some of the underlying neural circuits

1:17:15.060 --> 1:17:17.420
 of motivation, dopamine, and so forth.

1:17:17.420 --> 1:17:20.840
 But so much of what people struggle with out there

1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:25.840
 are elements around failure to pay attention

1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:28.300
 or challenges in paying attention,

1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:30.400
 which is essentially like putting the blinders on there,

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:32.660
 you know, getting a soda straw view of the world

1:17:32.660 --> 1:17:34.700
 and maintaining that for a bout of work

1:17:34.700 --> 1:17:38.900
 or something of that sort and trying to get into action.

1:17:38.900 --> 1:17:42.420
 So of course, this is carried out by many neural circuits,

1:17:42.420 --> 1:17:43.580
 not just the basal ganglia,

1:17:43.580 --> 1:17:45.820
 but what are the basal ganglia

1:17:45.820 --> 1:17:47.900
 and what are their primary roles

1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:51.920
 in controlling go type behavior and no go type behavior?

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:55.460
 Yeah, so I mean, the basal ganglia are sitting deep

1:17:55.460 --> 1:17:57.900
 in what you would call the forebrain.

1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:00.540
 So the highest levels of the brain,

1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:05.460
 they're sort of cousins to the cerebral cortex,

1:18:05.460 --> 1:18:07.440
 which we talked about is sort of the highest level

1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:09.900
 of your brain, the thing you're thinking with.

1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:11.860
 Cerebral cortex being the refined cousins,

1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:14.220
 and then you've got the, you know, the brutes.

1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:17.300
 Yeah, I mean, that's probably totally unfair,

1:18:17.300 --> 1:18:18.620
 but that's all right.

1:18:18.620 --> 1:18:19.580
 I like the basal ganglia.

1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:22.700
 I can relate to the brutish parts of the brain.

1:18:22.700 --> 1:18:23.900
 A little bit of hypothalamus,

1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:25.620
 a little bit of basal ganglia, sure.

1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:27.820
 We need it all, we need it all.

1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:31.860
 And, you know, this area of the brain

1:18:31.860 --> 1:18:35.340
 has gotten a lot bigger as the cortex has gotten bigger,

1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:39.340
 and it's deeply intertwined with cortical function.

1:18:39.340 --> 1:18:41.580
 The cortex can't really do what it needs to do

1:18:41.580 --> 1:18:43.740
 without the help of the basal ganglia and vice versa.

1:18:43.740 --> 1:18:46.560
 So they're really intertwined.

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:51.580
 And in a way, you can think about this logically

1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:54.180
 as saying, you know, if you have the ability

1:18:54.180 --> 1:18:57.340
 to withhold behavior or to execute it,

1:18:57.340 --> 1:18:58.900
 how do you decide which to do?

1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:01.720
 Well, the cortex is gonna have to do that thinking for you.

1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:04.340
 You have to be looking at all the contingencies

1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:07.700
 of your situation to decide, is this a crazy move?

1:19:07.700 --> 1:19:10.260
 Or is this a really smart investment right now?

1:19:10.260 --> 1:19:11.500
 Or, you know, what?

1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:13.100
 I don't wanna go out for a run in the morning,

1:19:13.100 --> 1:19:15.260
 but I'm gonna make myself go out for a run.

1:19:15.260 --> 1:19:17.820
 Or I'm having a great time out on a run,

1:19:17.820 --> 1:19:19.020
 and I know I need to get back,

1:19:19.020 --> 1:19:20.740
 but I kind of wanna go another mile.

1:19:20.740 --> 1:19:22.580
 I mean, another great example is that, you know,

1:19:22.580 --> 1:19:24.700
 the marshmallow test for the little kids, you know,

1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:28.740
 they can get two marshmallows if they hold off, you know,

1:19:28.740 --> 1:19:31.180
 just 30 seconds initially, you know.

1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:32.540
 They can have one right away,

1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:34.300
 but if they can wait 30 seconds, they got two, you know.

1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:37.200
 So that's the no-go because their cortex is saying,

1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:38.700
 you know, I would really like to have two

1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:40.020
 more than having one,

1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:42.500
 but they're not gonna get the two

1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:45.700
 unless they can not reach for the one.

1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:49.660
 So they've got to hold off the action,

1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:53.380
 and that has to result from a cognitive process.

1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:56.660
 So the cortex is involved in this in a major way.

1:19:57.780 --> 1:19:59.020
 Yeah, as I recall in that experiment,

1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:01.020
 the kids used a variety of tools to,

1:20:01.020 --> 1:20:03.020
 some would distract themselves.

1:20:03.020 --> 1:20:04.420
 I particularly related to the kid

1:20:04.420 --> 1:20:07.340
 that would just put himself right next to the marshmallows,

1:20:07.340 --> 1:20:09.980
 and then some of the kids covered their eyes.

1:20:09.980 --> 1:20:11.860
 Some of them would count or sing.

1:20:11.860 --> 1:20:13.320
 Yeah, so that's all very cortical, right?

1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:15.100
 Coming up with a novel strategy.

1:20:15.100 --> 1:20:16.600
 Simple example that we're using here,

1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:17.740
 but of course, this is at play.

1:20:17.740 --> 1:20:20.260
 Anytime someone decides they wanna go watch

1:20:20.260 --> 1:20:21.920
 a motivational speech or something,

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:24.300
 just, you know, a Steve Jobs commencement speech

1:20:24.300 --> 1:20:26.500
 just to get motivated to engage in their day.

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:28.420
 Should I take this new job?

1:20:28.420 --> 1:20:30.060
 You know, it's got great benefits,

1:20:30.060 --> 1:20:32.120
 but it's in a lousy part of the country.

1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:36.120
 Why do you think that some people have a harder time

1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:38.180
 running these go-no-go circuits,

1:20:38.180 --> 1:20:39.460
 and other people seem to have

1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:42.720
 very low activation energy, we would say.

1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:44.780
 They can just, you know, they have a task,

1:20:44.780 --> 1:20:46.100
 they just lean into the task.

1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:49.100
 Whereas some people getting into task completion

1:20:49.100 --> 1:20:52.500
 or things of that sort is very challenging for them.

1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:54.940
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's really just another,

1:20:54.940 --> 1:20:57.340
 it's a special case of a very general phenomenon,

1:20:57.340 --> 1:21:00.340
 which is brains are complicated.

1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:02.980
 And brains, you know, the brains we have

1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:07.060
 are the result of genetics and experience.

1:21:07.060 --> 1:21:08.860
 And my genes are different from your genes,

1:21:08.860 --> 1:21:11.060
 and my experiences are different from your experiences.

1:21:11.060 --> 1:21:13.620
 So the things that will be easy or hard for us

1:21:13.620 --> 1:21:15.380
 won't necessarily be aligned.

1:21:15.380 --> 1:21:18.700
 They might just happen to be just because they are.

1:21:18.700 --> 1:21:23.700
 But the point is that you're dealt a certain set of cards,

1:21:23.980 --> 1:21:27.660
 you have a certain set of genes, you are handed a brain.

1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:30.340
 You don't choose your brain, it's handed to you.

1:21:30.340 --> 1:21:32.340
 But then there's all this stuff you can do with it.

1:21:32.340 --> 1:21:37.340
 You know, you can learn to have new skills

1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:41.260
 or to act differently or to show more restraint,

1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:43.860
 which is kind of relevant to what we're talking about here.

1:21:43.860 --> 1:21:47.220
 Or maybe show less restraint if your problem is

1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:49.260
 you're so buttoned down, you never have any fun in life

1:21:49.260 --> 1:21:50.900
 and you should loosen up a little bit.

1:21:50.900 --> 1:21:51.740
 Thank you.

1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:52.740
 I appreciate the insult.

1:21:52.740 --> 1:21:53.580
 Yeah.

1:21:53.580 --> 1:21:54.400
 Yeah.

1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:55.240
 Yeah.

1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:56.460
 David's always encouraged me

1:21:56.460 --> 1:21:58.220
 to have a little more fun in life.

1:21:59.940 --> 1:22:04.120
 So basal ganglia are, they're kind of the disciplinarian

1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:07.660
 or they're sort of the instructor or conductor of sorts.

1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:08.500
 Right?

1:22:08.500 --> 1:22:11.460
 Go, no go, you know, you be quiet, you start now.

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:14.940
 I wish I knew more about the basal ganglia than I do.

1:22:14.940 --> 1:22:19.380
 My sense is that it, you know, this system is key

1:22:19.380 --> 1:22:22.460
 for implementing the plans that get cooked up

1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:27.460
 in the cortex, but they also influence the plans

1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:30.580
 that the cortex is dishing out

1:22:30.580 --> 1:22:33.740
 because this is a major source of information

1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:34.580
 to the cortex.

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.940
 So it becomes almost impossible to figure out

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:40.680
 where the computation begins and where it ends

1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:42.820
 and who's doing what because these things

1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:45.820
 are all interacting in a complex network.

1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:47.620
 And it's all of it, it's the whole network.

1:22:47.620 --> 1:22:49.420
 It's not, you know, one is the leader

1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:50.540
 and the other is the follower.

1:22:50.540 --> 1:22:51.380
 Right, of course.

1:22:51.380 --> 1:22:53.360
 Yeah, these are, all the structures that we're discussing

1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:55.460
 are working in parallel.

1:22:55.460 --> 1:22:56.280
 Right.

1:22:56.280 --> 1:22:59.180
 And there's a lot of changing crosstalk.

1:22:59.180 --> 1:23:03.300
 I have this somewhat sick habit, David,

1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:06.220
 every day I try and do 21 no-gos.

1:23:06.220 --> 1:23:10.260
 So if I want to reach for my phone, I try and not do it

1:23:10.260 --> 1:23:12.100
 just to see if I can prevent myself

1:23:12.100 --> 1:23:13.620
 from engaging in that behavior.

1:23:13.620 --> 1:23:17.340
 If it was reflexive, if it's something I want to do,

1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:19.900
 a deliberate choice, then I certainly allow myself

1:23:19.900 --> 1:23:20.740
 to do it. Right.

1:23:20.740 --> 1:23:22.900
 I don't tend to have too much trouble with motivation,

1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:25.900
 with go-type functions, mostly because I'm so busy

1:23:25.900 --> 1:23:30.900
 that I wish I had more time for more go's, so to speak.

1:23:31.100 --> 1:23:33.140
 But do you think these circuits

1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:35.100
 have genuine plasticity in them?

1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:37.300
 Absolutely, I mean, everybody knows

1:23:37.300 --> 1:23:39.580
 how they've learned over time

1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:41.620
 to wait for the two marshmallows, right?

1:23:41.620 --> 1:23:43.100
 You know, you don't have to have

1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:44.900
 instant gratification all the time.

1:23:44.900 --> 1:23:48.420
 You're willing to do a job sometimes

1:23:48.420 --> 1:23:49.500
 that isn't your favorite job

1:23:49.500 --> 1:23:50.900
 because it comes with the territory

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:52.840
 and you want the salary that comes at the end of the week

1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:54.220
 or the end of the month, right?

1:23:54.220 --> 1:23:57.280
 So we can defer gratification.

1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:59.940
 You know, we can choose not to say the thing

1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:01.940
 that we know is gonna inflame our partner

1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:05.020
 and create a meltdown for the next week.

1:24:05.020 --> 1:24:07.960
 You know, we learn this control,

1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:10.220
 but I think these are skills like any other.

1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:13.080
 You can get better at them if you practice them.

1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.960
 So I think you're choosing to do that spontaneously.

1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:18.020
 It's kind of a, you know, it's a mental practice.

1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:18.860
 It's a discipline.

1:24:18.860 --> 1:24:21.760
 It's a way of building a skill that you wanna have.

1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:23.520
 Yeah, I find it to be something

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:28.260
 that when I engage in a no-go type situation,

1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:32.040
 then the next time and the next time

1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:34.640
 that I find myself about to move reflexively,

1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:36.320
 there's a little gap in consciousness

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:38.240
 that I can make a decision

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:40.820
 whether or not this is really the best use of my time.

1:24:40.820 --> 1:24:43.160
 Because I sometimes wonder whether or not

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.440
 all this business around attention,

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:46.960
 certainly there's the case of ADHD

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:48.680
 and clinical diagnosed ADHD,

1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:51.200
 but all these, the issue around focus and attention

1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:53.440
 is really that people just have not really learned

1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:56.260
 how to short circuit a reflex.

1:24:56.260 --> 1:24:59.140
 And so much of what makes us different than rattlesnakes

1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:01.120
 or, well, actually they could be deliberate,

1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:03.240
 but from the other animals

1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:06.400
 and is our ability to suppress reflex.

1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:08.800
 Yeah, well, that's the cortex.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:10.040
 Let's just say the forebrain.

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:12.600
 Cortex and basal ganglia are working together,

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:15.600
 sitting on top of this lizard brain

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:17.920
 that's giving you all these great adaptive reflexes

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:19.440
 that help you survive.

1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:22.400
 You just hope you don't get the surprising case

1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:24.640
 where the thing that your reflex is telling you

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:26.160
 is actually exactly the wrong thing

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:28.280
 and you make a mistake, right?

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:29.880
 Right, so that's what the cortex is for.

1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:33.760
 It's adding nuance and context and experience,

1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:36.720
 past association and in human beings,

1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:41.320
 obviously learning from others through communication.

1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:43.600
 Well, I was, you went right to it

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:45.680
 and it was where I was gonna go.

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:47.060
 So let's talk about the cortex.

1:25:47.060 --> 1:25:49.400
 We've worked our way up the so-called neuroaxis

1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:52.600
 as the aficionados will know.

1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:54.080
 So we're in the cortex.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.840
 This is the seat of our higher consciousness,

1:25:55.840 --> 1:25:58.200
 self-image, planning and action.

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.480
 But as you mentioned, the cortex isn't just about that.

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:02.920
 It's got other regions that are involved in other things.

1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:05.560
 So maybe we should, staying with vision,

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.840
 let's talk a little bit about visual cortex.

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:11.760
 You told me a story, an amazing story about visual cortex.

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:13.800
 And it was somewhat of a sad story, unfortunately,

1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:17.000
 about someone who had a stroke to visual cortex.

1:26:17.900 --> 1:26:20.240
 Maybe if you would share that story,

1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:23.200
 because I think it illustrates many important principles

1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:25.040
 about what the cortex does.

1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:29.640
 Right, so the visual cortex is,

1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:31.560
 you could say the projection screen,

1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.720
 the first place where this information streaming

1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:39.240
 from the retina through this thalamus,

1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:43.360
 connecting linker gets played out

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:47.600
 for the highest level of your brain to see.

1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:48.760
 I mean, it's a representation.

1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:52.520
 It's a map of things going on in the visual world

1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.020
 that's in your brain.

1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:00.120
 And when we describe a scene to a friend,

1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:02.400
 we're using this chunk of our brain

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:03.520
 to be able to put words,

1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:06.360
 which are coming from a different part of our cortex,

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.240
 to the objects and movements and colors

1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:10.640
 that we see in the world.

1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:16.520
 So, you know, that's a key part of your visual experience.

1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:19.320
 When you can describe the things you're seeing,

1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:22.120
 you're looking at your visual cortex.

1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:22.960
 And this is-

1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:23.800
 Could I just ask a quick question?

1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:26.160
 So right now, because I'm looking at your face.

1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:26.980
 Right.

1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:29.160
 As we're talking, there are neurons

1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:31.800
 in my brain, more or less in the configuration

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:36.800
 of your face that are active as you move about.

1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:41.840
 And what if I were to close my eyes and just imagine,

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:44.000
 I do this all the time, by the way, David,

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.960
 I close my eyes and I imagine David Berson's face.

1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:50.160
 I don't tend to do that as often, maybe I should,

1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:51.280
 but you get the point.

1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:54.880
 I'm now using visualization of what you look like

1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:56.280
 by way of memory.

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:58.680
 If we were to image the neurons in my brain,

1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:03.480
 would the activity of neurons resemble the activity

1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:07.640
 of neurons that's present when I open my eyes

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:08.680
 and look at your actual face?

1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:10.040
 This is a deep question.

1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:12.960
 We don't really have a full accounting yet.

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:13.960
 Seems like an easy experiment to do.

1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:17.120
 Yes, except, you know, you're talking about looking

1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:21.640
 in detail at the activity of neurons in a human brain,

1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:24.200
 and that's not as easy to do as it would be

1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:26.480
 in some kind of animal model.

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:30.120
 But, you know, the bottom line is that you have

1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:33.360
 a spatial representation of the visual world,

1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:35.760
 laid as a map of the visual world,

1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:37.920
 laid out on the surface of your cortex.

1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:41.600
 The thing that's surprising is that it's not one map.

1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:43.880
 It's actually dozens of maps.

1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:45.440
 What do each of those maps do?

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:47.800
 Well, we don't really have a full accounting there either,

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:51.360
 but it looks a little bit like the diversification

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:54.040
 of the output neurons of the retina,

1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:56.120
 the ganglion cells we were talking about before.

1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:58.040
 There are different types of ganglion cells

1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:00.160
 that are encoding different kinds of information

1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:01.160
 about the visual world.

1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:04.240
 We talk about the ones that were encoding the brightness,

1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:06.880
 but other ones are encoding motion or color,

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.000
 these kinds of things.

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.760
 The same kinds of specializations

1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:12.160
 in different representations of the visual world

1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:15.200
 in the cortex seem to be true.

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:16.400
 It's a complex story.

1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:19.120
 We don't have the whole picture yet,

1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:21.000
 but it does look as if some parts of the brain

1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:24.680
 are much more important for things like reaching

1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:27.440
 for things in the space around you,

1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:29.320
 and other parts of the cortex are really important

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:32.040
 for making associations between particular visual things

1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:35.080
 you're looking at now and their significance.

1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:36.840
 What is that object?

1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:37.680
 What can it do for me?

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:38.880
 How can I use it?

1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:41.640
 What about the really specialized areas of cortex,

1:29:41.640 --> 1:29:45.720
 like the neurons that respond to particular faces

1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:48.920
 or neurons that, I don't know,

1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:51.560
 can help me understand where I am

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:54.040
 relative to some other specific object?

1:29:54.040 --> 1:29:58.320
 Right, so these are properties of neurons

1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:03.320
 that are extracted from, detected by,

1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:06.880
 recording the activity of single neurons

1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:08.880
 in some experimental system.

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:11.240
 What's going on when you actually perceive

1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:14.760
 your grandmother's face is a much more complicated question.

1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:16.840
 It clearly involves hundreds and thousands

1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:20.800
 and probably millions of neurons acting in a cooperative way.

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:23.200
 So you can pick out any one little element

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:25.360
 in this very complicated system

1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:27.440
 and see that it's responding differentially

1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:29.240
 to certain kinds of visual patterns,

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:30.920
 and you think you're seeing a glimpse

1:30:30.920 --> 1:30:32.320
 of some part of the process

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:35.440
 by which you recognize your grandmother's face.

1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:38.240
 But that's a long way from a complete description,

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.240
 and it certainly isn't gonna be at the level

1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:43.440
 of a magic single neuron that has the special stuff

1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:44.640
 to recognize your grandmother.

1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:46.920
 It's gonna be in some pattern of activity

1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:49.560
 across many, many cells,

1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:52.160
 resonating in some kind of special way

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:56.840
 that will represent the internal memory of your mother.

1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:57.680
 So it was really-

1:30:57.680 --> 1:30:58.520
 She's really incredible.

1:30:58.520 --> 1:30:59.360
 Yeah.

1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:00.880
 I mean, every time we do this deep dive,

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:02.080
 which we do from time to time,

1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:04.520
 you and I, we kind of like march into the nervous system

1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:09.520
 and explore how different aspects of our life experiences

1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:13.200
 is handled there and how it's organized.

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:16.920
 After so many decades of doing this,

1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:21.680
 it still boggles my mind that the collection of neurons

1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:26.400
 one through seven active in a particular sequence

1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:28.920
 gives the memory of a particular face

1:31:28.920 --> 1:31:32.600
 and run backwards seven through to one.

1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:33.640
 It gives you a complete, you know,

1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:38.520
 could be rattlesnake, pit viper, heat-sensing organs-

1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:39.360
 Right.

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:40.960
 As we were talking about earlier.

1:31:40.960 --> 1:31:43.240
 So it sounds, is it true that there's a lot

1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:45.520
 of multi-purposing of the circuitry?

1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:49.280
 Like we can't say one area of the brain does A

1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:50.960
 and another area of the brain does B,

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:55.560
 so, you know, areas can multitask or have multiple jobs.

1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:56.480
 They can moonlight.

1:31:56.480 --> 1:31:57.320
 Right.

1:31:57.320 --> 1:32:01.120
 But I think in my career,

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:05.160
 the hard problem has been to square that

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:10.880
 with the fact that, you know, things are specialized,

1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:14.840
 that there are specific genes expressed in specific neurons

1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:17.160
 that make them make synaptic connections

1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:19.240
 with only certain other neurons.

1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:21.880
 And that particular synaptic arrangement

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:24.840
 actually results in the processing of information

1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:28.400
 that's useful to the animal to survive, right?

1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:31.200
 So it's not as if it's either

1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:34.640
 a big undifferentiated network of cells

1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:37.080
 and looking at any one is never gonna tell you anything.

1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:39.280
 That's too extreme on the one hand,

1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:41.040
 nor is it the case that everything is hardwired

1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:42.600
 and every neuron has one function

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:45.760
 and this all happens in one place in the brain.

1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:47.960
 It's way more complicated and interactive

1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.560
 and interconnected than that.

1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:51.840
 So we're not hardwired or softwired.

1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:54.920
 We're sort of, I don't know what the analogy should be.

1:32:54.920 --> 1:32:57.120
 What substance would work best, David?

1:32:57.120 --> 1:32:58.960
 No idea there, but you know,

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:03.440
 the idea is that it's always network activity.

1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:06.040
 There's always many, many neurons involved

1:33:06.040 --> 1:33:09.240
 and yet there's tremendous specificity in the neurons

1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:10.960
 that might or might not be participating

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:13.880
 in any distributed function like that, right?

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:15.400
 So you have to get your mind around the fact

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:18.360
 that it's both very specific and very nonspecific

1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:19.360
 at the same time.

1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:20.600
 It's a little tricky to do,

1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:23.080
 but I think that's kind of where the truth lies.

1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:27.640
 Yeah, and so this example that you mentioned to me once

1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:30.640
 before about a woman who had a stroke and visual cortex,

1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:32.120
 I think speaks to some of this.

1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:33.340
 Right.

1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:34.760
 Could you share with us that story?

1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:38.480
 Sure, so the point is that you all,

1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:42.280
 those of us who see have representations

1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:44.680
 of the visual world and our visual cortex.

1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:49.680
 What happens to somebody when they become blind

1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:53.460
 because of problems in the eye, the retina, perhaps?

1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:56.440
 You have a big chunk of the cortex,

1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:59.540
 this really valuable real estate for neural processing

1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:05.040
 that has come to expect input from the visual system

1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:06.480
 and there isn't any anymore.

1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:08.940
 So you might think about that as fallow land, right?

1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:13.080
 It's just, it's unused by the nervous system

1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:13.920
 and that would be a pity,

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:16.640
 but it turns out that it is in fact used.

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:20.840
 And the case that you're talking about

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:25.840
 is of a woman who was blind from very early in her life

1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:30.400
 and who had risen through the ranks

1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:33.720
 to a very high level executive secretarial position

1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:35.340
 in a major corporation.

1:34:36.180 --> 1:34:38.600
 And she was extremely good at braille reading

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:39.720
 and she had a braille typewriter

1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:41.920
 and that's how everything was done.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:44.960
 And apparently she had a stroke

1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:46.600
 and was discovered at work, collapsed,

1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:48.440
 and they brought her to the hospital.

1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:51.960
 And apparently the neurologist who saw her

1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:54.480
 when she finally came to said,

1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:56.160
 I've got good news and bad news.

1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:57.920
 Bad news is you've had a stroke.

1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:00.240
 The good news is that it was in an area of your brain

1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:03.000
 you're not even using, it's your visual cortex.

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.560
 And I know you're blind from birth,

1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:06.520
 so there shouldn't be any issue here.

1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:09.980
 The problem was she lost her ability to read braille.

1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:12.300
 So what appears to have been the case,

1:35:12.300 --> 1:35:15.180
 and this has been confirmed in other ways

1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:17.500
 by imaging experiments in humans,

1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:20.820
 is that in people who are blind from very early in birth,

1:35:20.820 --> 1:35:24.020
 the visual cortex gets repurposed

1:35:24.020 --> 1:35:27.580
 as a center for processing tactile information.

1:35:27.580 --> 1:35:30.340
 And especially if you drain to be a good braille reader,

1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:33.140
 you're actually reallocating somehow

1:35:33.140 --> 1:35:36.340
 that real estate to your fingertips,

1:35:36.340 --> 1:35:39.060
 a part of the cortex that should be listening to the eyes.

1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:41.500
 So that's an extreme level of plasticity,

1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:44.860
 but what it shows is the visual cortex

1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:47.820
 is kind of a general purpose processing machine.

1:35:47.820 --> 1:35:50.660
 It's good at spatial information

1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:52.100
 and the skin of your fingers

1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:54.100
 is just another spatial sense

1:35:54.100 --> 1:35:56.420
 and deprived of any other input.

1:35:56.420 --> 1:35:58.660
 The brain seems smart enough,

1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:00.140
 if you want to put it that way,

1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:02.900
 to rewire itself to use that real estate

1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:06.940
 for something useful, in this case, reading braille.

1:36:06.940 --> 1:36:10.340
 Incredible, somewhat tragic, but incredible.

1:36:10.340 --> 1:36:12.260
 At least in that case, tragic.

1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:13.100
 Very informative.

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:14.060
 Very informative.

1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:16.060
 And of course it can go the other way too,

1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:20.180
 where people can gain function in particular modalities

1:36:20.180 --> 1:36:22.660
 like improved hearing or tactile function

1:36:22.660 --> 1:36:23.940
 in the absence of vision.

1:36:26.900 --> 1:36:29.340
 Tell us about connectomes.

1:36:29.340 --> 1:36:31.220
 We hear about genomes, proteomes,

1:36:31.220 --> 1:36:35.580
 microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms these days.

1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:38.180
 What's a connectome and why is it valuable?

1:36:38.180 --> 1:36:41.620
 Yeah, so connectome actually now has two meanings.

1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:46.540
 So I'll only refer to the one that is my passion right now.

1:36:46.540 --> 1:36:48.260
 And that is really trying to understand

1:36:48.260 --> 1:36:52.780
 the structure of nervous tissue at a scale

1:36:53.780 --> 1:36:55.820
 that's very, very fine.

1:36:56.820 --> 1:36:57.900
 Smaller than a millimeter.

1:36:57.900 --> 1:37:01.500
 Way smaller than a millimeter, a nanometer or less.

1:37:01.500 --> 1:37:03.380
 That's a thousand times smaller.

1:37:03.380 --> 1:37:08.380
 Or it's actually, you know, a million times smaller.

1:37:09.420 --> 1:37:13.620
 So really, really tiny on the scale of individual synapses

1:37:13.620 --> 1:37:15.700
 between individual neurons or even smaller,

1:37:15.700 --> 1:37:17.980
 like the individual synaptic vesicles

1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:19.660
 containing little packets of neurotransmitter

1:37:19.660 --> 1:37:22.180
 that are going to get released to one neuron

1:37:22.180 --> 1:37:23.980
 to communicate to the next.

1:37:23.980 --> 1:37:28.980
 So very, very fine, but the notion here is that

1:37:28.980 --> 1:37:33.980
 you're doing this section after section at very fine scale.

1:37:35.180 --> 1:37:37.620
 So in theory, what you have is a complete description

1:37:37.620 --> 1:37:41.660
 of a chunk of nervous tissue that is so complete

1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:43.860
 that if you took enough time to identify

1:37:43.860 --> 1:37:45.660
 where the boundaries of all the cells are,

1:37:45.660 --> 1:37:48.100
 you could come up with a complete description

1:37:48.100 --> 1:37:51.500
 of the synaptic wiring of that chunk of nervous tissue

1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:52.580
 because you have a complete description

1:37:52.580 --> 1:37:54.660
 of where all the cells are and where all the synapses

1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:55.500
 begin to occur.

1:37:55.500 --> 1:37:57.340
 So you have a complete description

1:37:57.340 --> 1:37:59.140
 of where all the cells are and where all the synapses

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:00.380
 begin where all the cells are.

1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:02.700
 So now you essentially have a wiring diagram

1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:04.660
 of this complicated piece of tissue.

1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:08.540
 So the omics part is the exhaustiveness of it.

1:38:08.540 --> 1:38:10.620
 Rather than looking at a couple of synapses

1:38:10.620 --> 1:38:13.860
 that are interesting to you from two different cell types,

1:38:13.860 --> 1:38:17.980
 you're looking at all the synapses of all of the cell types,

1:38:17.980 --> 1:38:22.660
 which of course is this massive avalanche of data, right?

1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:25.340
 So in genetics, you have genetics and then you have genomics,

1:38:25.340 --> 1:38:27.060
 which is the idea of getting the whole genome.

1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:27.900
 All of it.

1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:30.900
 And we don't really have an analogous word for genetics,

1:38:30.900 --> 1:38:33.180
 but it would be connectivity and kinomics.

1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:34.020
 Right.

1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:38.020
 Excuse me, connectomics, connectivity and connectomics.

1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:40.340
 Right, so it's wanting it all.

1:38:40.340 --> 1:38:42.700
 And of course it's crazy ambitious,

1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:45.260
 but that's where it gets fun.

1:38:45.260 --> 1:38:48.540
 Really it's a use of electron microscopy,

1:38:48.540 --> 1:38:53.500
 a very high resolution microscopic imaging system

1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:57.300
 on a new scale with way more payoff in terms

1:38:57.300 --> 1:38:59.540
 of understanding the connectivity of the nervous system.

1:38:59.540 --> 1:39:01.540
 And it's just emerging,

1:39:01.540 --> 1:39:04.300
 but I really think it's gonna revolutionize the field

1:39:04.300 --> 1:39:07.260
 because we're gonna be able to query these circuits.

1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:08.580
 How did they actually do it?

1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:10.260
 Look at the hardware in a way

1:39:10.260 --> 1:39:12.460
 that's never been possible before.

1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:15.100
 The way that I describe this to people is

1:39:15.100 --> 1:39:18.340
 if you were to take a chunk of kind of cooked

1:39:18.340 --> 1:39:21.780
 but cold spaghetti and slice it up very thin,

1:39:21.780 --> 1:39:24.820
 you're trying to connect up each image

1:39:24.820 --> 1:39:28.060
 of each slice of the edge of the spaghetti

1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:30.820
 as figure out which ropes of spaghetti belong to which.

1:39:30.820 --> 1:39:32.220
 And have a complete description

1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:33.780
 of where this piece of spaghetti touches

1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:34.740
 that piece of spaghetti

1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:36.300
 and is there something special there?

1:39:36.300 --> 1:39:38.660
 Where the meat sauce is and all the other cell types

1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:43.660
 and the pesto, where it all is around the spaghetti

1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:44.740
 because those are the other cells,

1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:47.500
 the blood vessels and the glial cells.

1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:49.780
 So what's it good for?

1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:51.780
 I mean, maps are great.

1:39:52.940 --> 1:39:55.660
 I always think of connectomics and genomics

1:39:55.660 --> 1:40:00.060
 and proteomics, et cetera, as necessary, but not sufficient.

1:40:00.060 --> 1:40:01.340
 Right, right.

1:40:01.340 --> 1:40:02.500
 So, I mean, in many cases,

1:40:02.500 --> 1:40:05.820
 what you do is you go out and probe the function

1:40:05.820 --> 1:40:07.940
 and you understand how the brain does the function

1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:10.900
 by finding neurons that seem to be firing

1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:14.060
 in association with this function that you're observing.

1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:15.660
 And little by little, you're working your way in

1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.260
 and now you wanna know what the connectivity is.

1:40:17.260 --> 1:40:19.700
 Maybe the anatomy could help you.

1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:21.500
 But this connectomics approach,

1:40:21.500 --> 1:40:24.500
 or at least the serial electron microscopy reconstruction

1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:28.540
 of neurons approach really is allowing us

1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:31.620
 to frame questions starting from the anatomy

1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:35.100
 and saying, I see a synaptic circuit here.

1:40:35.100 --> 1:40:37.180
 My prediction would be that these cell types

1:40:37.180 --> 1:40:38.820
 would interact in a particular way.

1:40:38.820 --> 1:40:40.140
 Is that right?

1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:42.180
 And then you can go and probe the physiology

1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:43.740
 and you might be right or you might be wrong,

1:40:43.740 --> 1:40:45.340
 but more often than not,

1:40:45.340 --> 1:40:47.420
 it looks like the structure is pointing us

1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:48.740
 in the right direction.

1:40:48.740 --> 1:40:53.460
 So in my case, I'm using this to try to understand a circuit

1:40:53.460 --> 1:40:56.100
 that is involved in this image stabilization network

1:40:56.100 --> 1:41:00.220
 we're talking about, keeping things stable on the retina.

1:41:00.220 --> 1:41:02.500
 And this thing will only respond

1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:04.700
 at certain speeds of motion.

1:41:04.700 --> 1:41:07.260
 These cells in the circuit, like slow motion,

1:41:07.260 --> 1:41:09.140
 they won't respond to fast motion.

1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:10.300
 How does that come about?

1:41:10.300 --> 1:41:14.020
 Well, I was able to probe the circuitry.

1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:15.460
 I knew what my cells looked like.

1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:17.420
 I could see which other cells were talking to it.

1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:19.060
 I could categorize all the cells

1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:20.580
 that might be the players here

1:41:20.580 --> 1:41:22.220
 that are involved in this mechanism

1:41:22.220 --> 1:41:25.500
 of tuning the thing for slow speeds.

1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:27.820
 And then we said, it looks like it's that cell type.

1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:31.100
 And we went and looked and the data bore that up.

1:41:31.100 --> 1:41:33.300
 But the anatomy drove the search

1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:34.460
 for the particular cell type

1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:36.100
 because we could see it connected

1:41:36.100 --> 1:41:37.980
 in the right place to the right cells.

1:41:37.980 --> 1:41:40.060
 So that creates the hypothesis

1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.580
 that lets you go query the physiology,

1:41:42.580 --> 1:41:43.980
 but it can go the other way as well.

1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:45.140
 So it's always the synergy

1:41:45.140 --> 1:41:47.700
 between these functional and structural approaches

1:41:47.700 --> 1:41:51.260
 that gives you the most lift.

1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:53.620
 But in many cases,

1:41:53.620 --> 1:41:56.620
 the anatomy has been a little bit the weak sister in this,

1:41:56.620 --> 1:41:59.100
 the structure, trying to work out the diagram

1:41:59.100 --> 1:42:00.860
 because we haven't had the methods.

1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:02.620
 Now the methods exist.

1:42:02.620 --> 1:42:05.700
 And this whole field is expanding very quickly

1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:08.220
 because people want these circuit diagrams

1:42:08.220 --> 1:42:10.860
 for the particular part of the nervous system

1:42:10.860 --> 1:42:12.380
 that they're working on.

1:42:12.380 --> 1:42:14.260
 If you don't know the cell types and the connections,

1:42:14.260 --> 1:42:17.380
 how do you really understand how the machine works?

1:42:17.380 --> 1:42:18.820
 Yeah, what I love about it is

1:42:18.820 --> 1:42:20.580
 we don't know what we don't know.

1:42:20.580 --> 1:42:22.700
 And as scientists, we don't ask questions.

1:42:22.700 --> 1:42:25.460
 We pose hypotheses, hypotheses being, of course,

1:42:25.460 --> 1:42:29.260
 some prediction that you wager your time on basically.

1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:32.300
 And it either turns out to be true or not true.

1:42:33.220 --> 1:42:37.580
 But if you don't know that a particular cell type is there,

1:42:37.580 --> 1:42:42.540
 you could never in any configuration of life

1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:46.540
 or a career or exploration of a nervous system

1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:49.300
 wager a hypothesis because you didn't know it was there.

1:42:49.300 --> 1:42:50.140
 So this allows you to say,

1:42:50.140 --> 1:42:52.900
 ah, there's a little interesting little connection

1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:54.980
 between this cell that I know is interesting

1:42:54.980 --> 1:42:56.660
 and another cell that's a little mysterious,

1:42:56.660 --> 1:42:59.060
 but interesting, I'm going to hypothesize

1:42:59.060 --> 1:43:01.260
 that it's doing blank, blank, and blank and go test that.

1:43:01.260 --> 1:43:03.420
 And in the absence of these connectomes,

1:43:03.420 --> 1:43:04.540
 you would never know that that cell

1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:06.540
 was lurking there in the shadows.

1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:07.980
 Right, right.

1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:09.500
 Yeah, and if you're just trying to understand

1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:14.220
 how information flows through this biological machine,

1:43:14.220 --> 1:43:16.380
 you want to know where things are.

1:43:16.380 --> 1:43:18.620
 Neuro-transmitters are dumped out of the terminals

1:43:18.620 --> 1:43:21.860
 of one cell and they diffuse across the space

1:43:21.860 --> 1:43:24.580
 between the two cells, which is kind of a liquidy space,

1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:26.700
 and they hit some receptors on the post-synaptic cell

1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:28.060
 and they have some impact.

1:43:28.900 --> 1:43:31.380
 Sometimes that's not through a regular synapse.

1:43:31.380 --> 1:43:33.060
 Sometimes it's through a neuromodulator,

1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:35.820
 like you often talk about on your podcast

1:43:35.820 --> 1:43:38.180
 that are sort of oozing dopamine, exactly,

1:43:38.180 --> 1:43:40.500
 oozing into the space between the cells,

1:43:40.500 --> 1:43:42.660
 and it may be acting at some distance

1:43:42.660 --> 1:43:44.980
 far from where it was released, right?

1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:47.140
 But if you don't know where the release is happening

1:43:47.140 --> 1:43:49.140
 and where other things are that might respond

1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:52.460
 to that release, you're groping around in the dark.

1:43:52.460 --> 1:43:54.060
 Well, I love that you are doing this,

1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:57.740
 and I have to share with the listeners

1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:00.420
 that the first time I ever met David,

1:44:00.420 --> 1:44:03.180
 and every time I've ever met with him in person,

1:44:03.180 --> 1:44:06.180
 at least at his laboratory at Brown,

1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:08.700
 he was in his office, door closed,

1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:11.700
 drawing neurons and their connections.

1:44:11.700 --> 1:44:13.660
 And this is somewhat unusual for somebody

1:44:13.660 --> 1:44:16.460
 who's a, you know, endowed full professor,

1:44:16.460 --> 1:44:19.220
 chairman of the department, et cetera, for many years,

1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:20.860
 to be doing the hands-on work.

1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:22.740
 Typically that's the stuff that's done by technicians

1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:24.140
 or graduate students or post-docs,

1:44:24.140 --> 1:44:28.060
 but I think it's fair to say that you really love

1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:31.420
 looking at nervous systems and drawing

1:44:31.420 --> 1:44:34.900
 the accurate renditions of how those nervous systems

1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:37.300
 are organized and thinking about how they work.

1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:38.780
 Yeah, it's pure joy for me.

1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:40.420
 I mean, I'm a very visual person.

1:44:40.420 --> 1:44:41.540
 My wife is an artist.

1:44:41.540 --> 1:44:43.500
 We look at a lot of art together.

1:44:43.500 --> 1:44:47.540
 Just the forms of things are gorgeous in their own right,

1:44:47.540 --> 1:44:51.260
 but to know that the form is, in a sense, the function,

1:44:51.260 --> 1:44:55.540
 that the architecture of the connectivity

1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:59.420
 is how the computation happens in the brain at some level,

1:44:59.420 --> 1:45:02.820
 even though we don't fully understand that in most contexts,

1:45:02.820 --> 1:45:05.380
 gives me great joy, because I'm working on something

1:45:05.380 --> 1:45:09.860
 that's both visually beautiful, but also deeply beautiful

1:45:09.860 --> 1:45:14.860
 and it's sort of a higher sort of knowledge context.

1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:17.580
 You know, what is it all about?

1:45:17.580 --> 1:45:18.420
 Love it.

1:45:18.420 --> 1:45:21.540
 Well, as a final question, I get asked very often

1:45:21.540 --> 1:45:24.060
 about how people should learn about neuroscience

1:45:25.340 --> 1:45:27.260
 or how they should go about pursuing

1:45:27.260 --> 1:45:28.700
 maybe an education in neuroscience

1:45:28.700 --> 1:45:30.300
 if they're at that stage of their life

1:45:30.300 --> 1:45:34.020
 or that's appropriate for their current trajectory.

1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:37.060
 Do you have any advice to young people, old people,

1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:39.700
 and anything in between about how to learn

1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:42.460
 about the nervous system, maybe in a more formal way?

1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:43.860
 I mean, obviously we have our podcast.

1:45:43.860 --> 1:45:45.740
 There are other sources

1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:47.100
 of neuroscience information out there,

1:45:47.100 --> 1:45:49.340
 but for the young person who thinks

1:45:49.340 --> 1:45:51.580
 they want to understand the brain,

1:45:51.580 --> 1:45:53.780
 they want to learn about the brain,

1:45:53.780 --> 1:45:55.060
 what should we tell them?

1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:56.340
 Well, that's a great question.

1:45:56.340 --> 1:45:57.860
 And there's so many sources out there.

1:45:57.860 --> 1:45:59.260
 It's almost a question of, you know,

1:45:59.260 --> 1:46:01.060
 how do you deal with this avalanche

1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:02.820
 of information out there?

1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:04.540
 I mean, I think our podcast is a great way

1:46:04.540 --> 1:46:06.740
 for people to learn more about the nervous system

1:46:06.740 --> 1:46:08.260
 in an accessible way.

1:46:08.260 --> 1:46:09.740
 But there's so much stuff out there.

1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:10.940
 And it's not just that.

1:46:10.940 --> 1:46:13.940
 I mean, the resources are becoming more and more available

1:46:13.940 --> 1:46:16.980
 for average folks to participate

1:46:16.980 --> 1:46:19.260
 in neuroscience research on some level.

1:46:19.260 --> 1:46:20.940
 There's this famous eye wire project

1:46:20.940 --> 1:46:21.780
 of Sebastian Sommer.

1:46:21.780 --> 1:46:23.260
 Oh yeah, maybe tell us about eye wire.

1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:24.580
 Yeah, so that's connectomics.

1:46:24.580 --> 1:46:29.220
 And that's a situation where a very clever scientist realized

1:46:29.220 --> 1:46:33.860
 that the physical work of doing all this reconstruction

1:46:33.860 --> 1:46:37.260
 of neurons from these electron micrographs,

1:46:37.260 --> 1:46:39.940
 there's a lot of time involved.

1:46:39.940 --> 1:46:42.420
 Many, many person hours have to go into that

1:46:42.420 --> 1:46:46.380
 to come up with the map that you want of where the cells are.

1:46:46.380 --> 1:46:49.260
 And he was very clever about setting up a context

1:46:49.260 --> 1:46:51.380
 in which he could crowdsource this.

1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:52.220
 And people who were interested

1:46:52.220 --> 1:46:54.780
 in getting a little experience looking at nervous tissue

1:46:54.780 --> 1:46:57.460
 and participating in a research project

1:46:57.460 --> 1:46:59.660
 could learn how to do this and do a little bit.

1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:00.500
 From their living room.

1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:01.820
 From their living room, their laptop.

1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.460
 We'll put a link to eye wire.

1:47:03.460 --> 1:47:04.620
 It also is a great bridge

1:47:04.620 --> 1:47:06.500
 between what we were just talking about, connectomics

1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:08.900
 and actually participating in research.

1:47:08.900 --> 1:47:12.140
 And you don't need a graduate mentor or anything like that.

1:47:12.140 --> 1:47:14.660
 Right, so more of this is coming.

1:47:14.660 --> 1:47:17.380
 And I'm actually interested in building more of this

1:47:18.260 --> 1:47:20.180
 so that people who are interested,

1:47:20.180 --> 1:47:21.580
 wanna participate at some level,

1:47:21.580 --> 1:47:24.540
 don't necessarily have the time or resources

1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:27.220
 to get involved in laboratory research

1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:28.860
 and can get exposed to it

1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:30.980
 and participate and actually contribute.

1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:34.620
 So I think that's one thing.

1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:38.220
 I mean, just asking questions of the people around you

1:47:38.220 --> 1:47:39.340
 who know a little bit more

1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:41.180
 and have them point you in the right direction.

1:47:41.180 --> 1:47:42.580
 Here's a book you might like to read.

1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:45.780
 There's lots of great popular books out there

1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:48.700
 that are accessible that will give you some more sense

1:47:48.700 --> 1:47:51.700
 of the full range of what's out there in the neurosciences

1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:52.540
 and how-

1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:54.820
 We can put some links to a few of those that we like

1:47:54.820 --> 1:47:56.260
 on basic neuroscience.

1:47:56.260 --> 1:47:57.820
 My good friend, Dick Masland,

1:47:57.820 --> 1:48:00.380
 the late Richard, people will call him Dick,

1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:02.340
 Dick Masland had a good book.

1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:05.380
 I forget the title at the moment.

1:48:05.380 --> 1:48:07.380
 It's sitting behind me somewhere over there on the shelf,

1:48:07.380 --> 1:48:10.580
 but about vision and how nervous systems work.

1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:12.620
 A pretty accessible book for the general public.

1:48:12.620 --> 1:48:13.540
 Right, right.

1:48:13.540 --> 1:48:16.620
 So that, and there's so many sources out there.

1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:18.140
 I mean, Wikipedia is a great way.

1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:20.180
 If you had a particular question about visual function,

1:48:20.180 --> 1:48:21.900
 I would say, by all means,

1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:25.580
 head to Wikipedia and get the first look

1:48:25.580 --> 1:48:27.540
 and follow the references from there

1:48:27.540 --> 1:48:30.300
 or go to your library or, you know,

1:48:30.300 --> 1:48:31.980
 there's so many ways to get into it.

1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:33.940
 It's such an exciting field now.

1:48:33.940 --> 1:48:35.060
 There's so many, I mean,

1:48:35.060 --> 1:48:37.500
 any particular realm that's special to you,

1:48:37.500 --> 1:48:39.140
 your experience, your, you know,

1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:42.020
 your strengths, your passions,

1:48:42.020 --> 1:48:44.740
 there's a field of neuroscience devoted to that.

1:48:44.740 --> 1:48:45.580
 You know, if you've got,

1:48:45.580 --> 1:48:47.860
 if you know somebody who's got a neurological problem

1:48:47.860 --> 1:48:50.460
 or a psychiatric problem,

1:48:50.460 --> 1:48:53.020
 there's a branch of neuroscience that is devoted

1:48:53.020 --> 1:48:55.700
 to trying to understand that and to solve

1:48:55.700 --> 1:48:58.420
 these kinds of problems down the line.

1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:00.900
 So feel the, feel the buzz.

1:49:00.900 --> 1:49:03.340
 It's an exciting time to get involved.

1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:04.700
 Great, those are great resources

1:49:04.700 --> 1:49:06.500
 that people can access from anywhere,

1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:08.740
 zero cost as you need an internet connection.

1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:11.300
 But aside from that, we'll put the links to some.

1:49:11.300 --> 1:49:13.860
 And I'm remembering Dick's book is called

1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:15.260
 We Know It When We See It.

1:49:15.260 --> 1:49:16.900
 Right, one of my heroes.

1:49:16.900 --> 1:49:18.980
 Yeah, a wonderful colleague who unfortunately

1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:20.060
 we lost a few years ago.

1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:24.060
 But listen, David, this has been wonderful.

1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:24.900
 It's been a blast.

1:49:24.900 --> 1:49:26.780
 We really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

1:49:26.780 --> 1:49:29.300
 As people probably realize by now,

1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:31.020
 you're an incredible wealth of knowledge

1:49:31.020 --> 1:49:32.940
 about the entire nervous system.

1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:35.180
 Today, we just hit this top contour

1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:37.500
 of a number of different areas to give a flavor

1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:40.060
 of the different ways that the nervous system works

1:49:40.060 --> 1:49:43.300
 and is organized and how that's put together,

1:49:43.300 --> 1:49:45.180
 how these areas are talking to one another.

1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:46.620
 What I love about you is that you're

1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:49.980
 such an incredible educator and I've taught so many students

1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:54.180
 over the years, but also for me personally as friends,

1:49:54.180 --> 1:49:57.820
 but also anytime that I want to touch into the beauty

1:49:57.820 --> 1:50:00.700
 of the nervous system, I rarely lose touch with it.

1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:02.940
 But anytime I want to touch into it and start thinking

1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:05.900
 about new problems and ways that the nervous system

1:50:05.900 --> 1:50:08.340
 is doing things that I hadn't thought about, I call you.

1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:12.020
 So please forgive me for the calls past, present,

1:50:12.020 --> 1:50:13.860
 and future, unless you change your number.

1:50:13.860 --> 1:50:15.940
 And even if you do, I'll be calling.

1:50:15.940 --> 1:50:18.540
 It's been such a blast, Andy.

1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:21.020
 This has been a great session

1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:22.740
 and it's always fun talking to you.

1:50:22.740 --> 1:50:24.980
 It always gets my brain racing.

1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:27.900
 So thank you.

1:50:27.900 --> 1:50:28.800
 Thank you.

1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:29.920
 Thank you for joining me today

1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:32.320
 for my discussion with Dr. David Berson.

1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:35.220
 By now, you should have a much clearer understanding

1:50:35.220 --> 1:50:38.220
 of how the brain is organized and how it works

1:50:38.220 --> 1:50:40.820
 to do all the incredible things that it does.

 That's the best way to support us.

1:51:11.820 --> 1:51:13.060
 And we have a Patreon.

1:51:13.060 --> 1:51:15.880
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:18.580
 There, you can support us at any level that you like.

1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:21.580
 While today's discussion did not focus on supplements,

1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:24.220
 many previous podcast episodes include discussions

1:51:24.220 --> 1:51:25.220
 about supplements.

1:51:25.220 --> 1:51:28.220
 And while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:51:28.220 --> 1:51:31.080
 many people derive benefit from them for things like sleep

1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:33.940
 or focus or anxiety relief and so on.

1:51:33.940 --> 1:51:36.140
 One issue with the supplement industry, however,

1:51:36.140 --> 1:51:38.060
 is that oftentimes the quality

1:51:38.060 --> 1:51:40.580
 will really vary across brands.

1:51:40.580 --> 1:51:43.060
 That's why we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-I-N-E,

1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:44.740
 because Thorne supplements are

1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:46.220
 of the absolute highest standards

1:51:46.220 --> 1:51:48.480
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients they include

1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:49.980
 and the precision of the amounts

1:51:49.980 --> 1:51:51.380
 of the ingredients they include.

1:51:51.380 --> 1:51:53.100
 In other words, what's listed on the bottle

1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:54.860
 is what's actually found in the bottle,

1:51:54.860 --> 1:51:57.060
 which is not true of many supplements out there

1:51:57.060 --> 1:51:58.240
 that have been tested.

1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:00.100
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:52:00.100 --> 1:52:04.980
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:52:04.980 --> 1:52:06.960
 And there you can see the supplements that I take

1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:09.560
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:11.660
 And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

1:52:11.660 --> 1:52:12.500
 through that portal,

1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:15.640
 thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:18.580
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:52:18.580 --> 1:52:20.060
 that Thorne happens to make.

1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:21.780

1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:27.860
 Both places I regularly post short video posts

1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:31.200
 or text posts that give tools related to health

1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:32.780
 and neuroscience and so forth.

1:52:32.780 --> 1:52:35.740
 And most of the time that information is not overlapping

1:52:35.740 --> 1:52:37.140
 with the information on the podcast.

1:52:37.140 --> 1:52:39.680
 Again, it's just Huberman Lab on Instagram and Twitter.

1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:41.260
 And last but not least,

1:52:41.260 --> 1:52:43.220
 thank you for your interest in science.
