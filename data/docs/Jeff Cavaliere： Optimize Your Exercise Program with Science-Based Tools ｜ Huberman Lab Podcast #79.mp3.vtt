00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.240
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.240 --> 00:13.120
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.120 --> 00:14.880
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.140
 Today, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere.

00:17.140 --> 00:19.040
 Jeff Cavaliere holds a master of science

00:19.040 --> 00:20.120
 in physical therapy,

00:20.120 --> 00:23.000
 and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.740
 He did his training at the University of Connecticut stores,

00:25.740 --> 00:27.840
 one of the top five programs in the world

00:27.840 --> 00:30.480
 in physical therapy and sports medicine.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.480
 I discovered Jeff Cavaliere over 10 years ago

00:33.480 --> 00:35.440
 from his online content.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.680
 His online content includes information

00:37.680 --> 00:39.360
 about how to train for strength,

00:39.360 --> 00:42.000
 how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.580
 how to train for endurance,

00:43.580 --> 00:46.000
 as well as how to rehabilitate injuries

00:46.000 --> 00:49.120
 to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition,

00:49.120 --> 00:51.160
 and supplementation.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.640
 I've always found his content

00:52.640 --> 00:56.320
 to be incredibly science-based, incredibly clear,

00:56.320 --> 00:59.880
 sometimes surprising, and always incredibly actionable.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.200
 It is therefore not surprising

01:01.200 --> 01:03.400
 that he has one of the largest online platforms

01:03.400 --> 01:05.440
 for fitness, nutrition, supplementation,

01:05.440 --> 01:07.120
 and injury rehabilitation.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.280
 Jeff has also worked with an enormous number

01:09.280 --> 01:10.640
 of professional athletes

01:10.640 --> 01:12.440
 and has served as head physical therapist

01:12.440 --> 01:15.080
 and assistant strength coach for the New York Mets.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.840
 Again, the content that Jeff Cavaliere has posted online

01:17.840 --> 01:20.720
 has been so immensely useful to me over the years

01:20.720 --> 01:22.480
 that I was absolutely thrilled

01:22.480 --> 01:23.800
 to get the chance to sit down with him

01:23.800 --> 01:27.540
 and ask him about everything from how to train

01:27.540 --> 01:29.960
 in terms of how to split up the body parts

01:29.960 --> 01:31.080
 that you train across the week,

01:31.080 --> 01:34.160
 how to integrate strength training and endurance training,

01:34.160 --> 01:36.440
 when to stretch, how to stretch.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.980
 Indeed, we talked about nutrition,

01:37.980 --> 01:40.000
 we talk a bit about supplementation,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.460
 we talk about how to really avoid creating imbalances

01:43.460 --> 01:46.580
 in muscle and in neural control over muscle.

01:46.580 --> 01:48.240
 So one thing that's really wonderful about Jeff

01:48.240 --> 01:49.600
 is he really has an understanding

01:49.600 --> 01:52.120
 of not just how muscles and bones and tendons

01:52.120 --> 01:53.160
 and ligaments work together,

01:53.160 --> 01:55.680
 but how the nervous system interfaces with those.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.560
 We talked about the mental side of training,

01:57.560 --> 01:59.940
 including when to bring specific concentration

01:59.940 --> 02:01.160
 to the muscles that you're training

02:01.160 --> 02:03.920
 and when to think more about how to move weights

02:03.920 --> 02:07.400
 through space and think more about the movements overall.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.880
 I'm certain that you'll find the conversation that we held

02:09.880 --> 02:12.200
 to be immensely useful and informative

02:12.200 --> 02:13.640
 for your fitness practices

02:13.640 --> 02:16.980
 and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general

02:16.980 --> 02:19.600
 and how to set up a lifelong fitness practice,

02:19.600 --> 02:21.960
 one that will give you the strength that you desire,

02:21.960 --> 02:24.840
 one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire,

02:24.840 --> 02:26.600
 one that will set you up for endurance

02:26.600 --> 02:28.000
 and cardiovascular health,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.240
 basically an overall fitness program.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.420
 I really feel this is where Jeff Cavaliere shines

02:32.420 --> 02:35.300
 above and beyond so many of the other PTs and fitness

02:35.300 --> 02:37.420
 so-called influencers that are out there.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.360
 Again, everything is grounded in science,

02:39.360 --> 02:42.800
 everything is clear and everything is actionable.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.280
 And while we do cover an enormous amount of information

02:45.280 --> 02:46.560
 during today's episode,

02:46.560 --> 02:49.560
 if you want to dive even deeper into that information,

02:49.560 --> 02:51.440
 you can go to athletenext.com

02:51.440 --> 02:53.680
 where you'll find some of Jeff's programs.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.160
 You can also find him at athletenext on YouTube.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.980
 There you will find videos, for instance,

02:58.980 --> 03:01.940
 like the how to repair or heal from lower back pain,

03:01.940 --> 03:03.800
 something that I actually followed directly

03:03.800 --> 03:06.880
 long before I ever met Jeff, has over 32 million views.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.240
 And that is not by accident,

03:08.240 --> 03:10.080
 is because the protocols there again

03:10.080 --> 03:11.880
 are surprising and actionable.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.140
 They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.480
 So I'm immensely grateful for that content.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.920
 And it extends into everything from, again,

03:19.920 --> 03:22.480
 hypertrophy, endurance and strength training and so on.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.880
 Again, it's athletenext.com as the website,

03:24.880 --> 03:28.620
 athletenext on YouTube, and also athletenext on Instagram.

03:28.620 --> 03:30.560
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce

03:30.560 --> 03:32.840
 that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.100
 We've done that for several reasons.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.160
 First of all, the quality of their supplements

03:36.160 --> 03:37.700
 is exceedingly high.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.800
 Second of all, we wanted to have a location

03:39.800 --> 03:41.400
 where you could find all of the supplements

03:41.400 --> 03:43.080
 discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:43.080 --> 03:45.040
 in one easy to find place.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.040
 You can now find that place at livemomentous.com

03:48.040 --> 03:49.400
 slash Huberman.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.740
 In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,

03:52.740 --> 03:54.600
 something that a lot of other supplement companies

03:54.600 --> 03:55.860
 simply do not do.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.760
 So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US

03:57.760 --> 03:58.840
 or you live abroad.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.600
 Right now, not all of the supplements

04:00.600 --> 04:03.440
 that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,

04:03.440 --> 04:05.120
 but that catalog of supplements

04:05.120 --> 04:06.840
 is being expanded very rapidly.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.600
 And a good number of them that we've talked about,

04:08.600 --> 04:10.960
 some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus

04:10.960 --> 04:13.220
 and other aspects of mental and physical health

04:13.220 --> 04:14.060
 are already there.

04:14.060 --> 04:15.880
 Again, you can find them at livemomentous.com

04:15.880 --> 04:16.880
 slash Huberman.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.760
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

04:18.760 --> 04:20.760
 that this podcast is separate from my teaching

04:20.760 --> 04:22.520
 and research roles at Stanford.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.720
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:24.720 --> 04:26.720
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

04:26.720 --> 04:28.760
 about science and science-related tools

04:28.760 --> 04:30.220
 to the general public.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.260
 In keeping with that theme,

04:31.260 --> 04:34.080
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.760
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.880
 I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,

04:40.880 --> 04:43.440
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.160
 The reason that I started taking AG1

04:45.160 --> 04:47.560
 and the reason I still take AG1 twice a day

04:47.560 --> 04:50.280
 is that it covers all of my foundational health needs

04:50.280 --> 04:53.200
 for mental health, physical health, and performance.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
 As I mentioned earlier, it has vitamins and minerals

04:55.600 --> 04:58.720
 that cover any deficiencies I might have in my diet.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.600
 It also has probiotics, and the probiotics are key

05:01.600 --> 05:03.840
 for supporting the so-called gut microbiome.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.320
 The gut microbiome are trillions of little micro bacteria

05:06.320 --> 05:08.200
 that live in our gut from our throat

05:08.200 --> 05:10.100
 all the way down to the base of our gut

05:10.100 --> 05:12.320
 that support everything from our immune system

05:12.320 --> 05:15.520
 to our hormone health to the so-called gut brain axis.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.180
 That is, our gut and our brain are in direct communication

05:18.180 --> 05:20.640
 with one another in ways that support our mood,

05:20.640 --> 05:23.420
 our ability to think, and overall brain health.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.920
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:24.920 --> 05:27.820
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:27.820 --> 05:29.040
 to claim a special offer.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.640
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

05:30.640 --> 05:32.660
 which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

05:32.660 --> 05:33.920
 while you're on the road,

05:33.920 --> 05:37.520
 and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.240
 Vitamin D3 and K2 are essential

05:40.240 --> 05:42.120
 for an enormous number of aspects

05:42.120 --> 05:44.060
 of your mental health, physical health, and performance

05:44.060 --> 05:46.480
 by impacting things like hormone regulation,

05:46.480 --> 05:49.040
 calcium regulation, and cardiovascular health.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.960
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:51.960 --> 05:53.520
 to claim that special offer.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.200
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.840
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

05:57.840 --> 05:59.640
 with heating and sleep tracking

05:59.640 --> 06:01.960
 and importantly, cooling capacity.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.640
 I've talked many times before on this podcast

06:03.640 --> 06:06.160
 and on another podcast about the close relationship

06:06.160 --> 06:07.560
 between temperature and sleep.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.800
 That is, your body temperature has to drop

06:09.800 --> 06:12.520
 by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep,

06:12.520 --> 06:14.860
 and waking up involves heating up of your body

06:14.860 --> 06:16.700
 by about one to three degrees.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.540
 Now, some people run cold during the night.

06:18.540 --> 06:21.160
 They need to heat their sleeping environment.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.000
 Other people run too hot during the night.

06:23.000 --> 06:23.960
 I'm one such person.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.760
 I tend to wake up in the middle of the night

06:25.760 --> 06:27.600
 if I get warm at all.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.000
 With Eight Sleep, I'm able to cool my sleeping environment

06:30.000 --> 06:32.060
 in a very precise way,

06:32.060 --> 06:33.960
 even so precise that I can control the temperature

06:33.960 --> 06:36.060
 at the beginning, middle, and end of the night

06:36.060 --> 06:38.520
 so that I fall asleep easily, stay deeply asleep,

06:38.520 --> 06:41.740
 and wake up feeling better than I've ever felt before.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.220
 The PodPro cover by Eight Sleep

06:43.220 --> 06:44.960
 is their most advanced solution on the market

06:44.960 --> 06:46.360
 for thermal regulation.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.120
 It pairs dynamic cooling and heating

06:48.120 --> 06:50.680
 with biometric tracking if you want to use that.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.720
 Also, it has this nice feature

06:51.720 --> 06:53.820
 that it'll vibrate in the morning to wake you up.

06:53.820 --> 06:56.400
 I rather like that vibration feature too.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.920
 You can add the cover to any mattress

06:57.920 --> 07:00.460
 and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit

07:00.460 --> 07:02.580
 or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.840
 So again, it can be customized to your sleep needs.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.820
 If you want to try Eight Sleep,

07:06.820 --> 07:09.120

07:20.700 --> 07:23.400
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.360
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

07:25.360 --> 07:27.280
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.280
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

07:29.280 --> 07:31.600
 from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses

07:31.600 --> 07:34.580
 and sunglasses is made with performance in mind.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.120
 That said, the aesthetics of Roka eyeglasses

07:37.120 --> 07:39.080
 and sunglasses is superb.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.920
 I've spent a lifetime working on the biology

07:40.920 --> 07:41.760
 of the visual system,

07:41.760 --> 07:43.880
 and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend

07:43.880 --> 07:45.920
 with an enormous number of challenges

07:45.920 --> 07:47.660
 in order to be able to see clearly.

07:47.660 --> 07:50.160
 Roka understands this and has developed their eyeglasses

07:50.160 --> 07:52.800
 and sunglasses in a manner such that when you move

07:52.800 --> 07:55.840
 from say a shady area to a brightly lit area,

07:55.840 --> 07:58.960
 or when you are in different lit environments indoors,

07:58.960 --> 08:01.080
 you can always see with crystal clarity.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.320
 And they won't slip off if you sweat.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.560
 In fact, they were originally designed for exercise.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.840
 You can wear them while running or cycling,

08:07.840 --> 08:09.100
 but they have a terrific aesthetic.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.760
 So unlike a lot of so-called performance

08:10.760 --> 08:12.400
 or exercise glasses that are out there

08:12.400 --> 08:15.620
 that make people frankly look like cyborgs in my opinion,

08:15.620 --> 08:17.720
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses look terrific.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.220
 You'd be proud to wear them to work or out to dinner

08:20.220 --> 08:22.120
 or when you exercise.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.180
 If you want to try Roka glasses, you can go to roka.com,

08:25.180 --> 08:28.100
 that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman

08:28.100 --> 08:30.260
 to save 20% off on your first order.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.000
 Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.200
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.420
 And now for my discussion with Jeff Cavaliere.

08:38.420 --> 08:40.920
 Jeff, such a pleasure for me to have you here.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.680
 I'm glad to be here, it's amazing.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.400
 I'm a long time consumer of your content.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.280
 I've learned a tremendous amount about fitness,

08:50.280 --> 08:52.560
 both in the weight room, cardio, nutrition,

08:52.560 --> 08:55.120
 things that I've applied for over a decade.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.460
 So for me, this is particularly meaningful.

08:57.460 --> 09:01.620
 And my goal here is really to ask a bunch of questions

09:01.620 --> 09:03.560
 to which I'm interested in the answers,

09:03.560 --> 09:05.820
 but also for which I know the audience

09:05.820 --> 09:07.500
 is really curious about.

09:07.500 --> 09:11.180
 So one of your mantras is,

09:11.180 --> 09:13.180
 if you want to look like an athlete, train like an athlete.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.920
 And I think that's something really special

09:14.920 --> 09:17.040
 that sets aside what you do

09:17.040 --> 09:21.740
 from what a lot of other very well qualified people do.

09:21.740 --> 09:26.220
 And in terms of the use of weights and resistance,

09:26.220 --> 09:28.820
 whether or not it's body weight or weights in the gym

09:28.820 --> 09:31.180
 or pulleys versus cardio,

09:31.180 --> 09:33.540
 you know, in terms of overall health, aesthetics,

09:33.540 --> 09:34.980
 and athleticism,

09:34.980 --> 09:37.940
 is there a way that you could point to, you know,

09:37.940 --> 09:40.340
 the idea that maybe people should be doing, you know,

09:40.340 --> 09:44.420
 50% resistance training and 50% cardio,

09:44.420 --> 09:47.400
 maybe it's 70-30, maybe it's 30-70.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.760
 And here I'm talking about the typical person

09:49.760 --> 09:51.300
 who would like to maintain,

09:51.300 --> 09:54.540
 or maybe even add some muscle mass,

09:54.540 --> 09:56.860
 probably in particular areas for most people,

09:56.860 --> 09:58.260
 as opposed to just overall mass,

09:58.260 --> 09:59.620
 although we'll talk about that later.

09:59.620 --> 10:01.420
 And people who want to maintain a relatively low

10:01.420 --> 10:04.380
 body fat percentage and being good cardiovascular health.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.300
 What's the sort of contour of a basic program

10:07.300 --> 10:10.500
 that anybody could think about as a starting place?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.540
 I think it's like a 60-40 split,

10:13.540 --> 10:16.060
 which would be leaning towards weight training,

10:16.060 --> 10:18.780
 you know, strength and then, you know,

10:18.780 --> 10:20.660
 the conditioning aspect be about 40%.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.940
 So if you look at it over the course of a training week,

10:22.940 --> 10:25.460
 I mean, five days in a gym would be a great task.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.540
 And obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home,

10:27.540 --> 10:29.980
 but three days strength training,

10:29.980 --> 10:31.900
 Monday, Wednesday, Friday, conditioning,

10:31.900 --> 10:33.500
 Tuesday, Thursday, you know, two days.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.740
 It's a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.780
 Of course, depending upon training goals,

10:38.780 --> 10:40.260
 and as you said, the aesthetic goals,

10:40.260 --> 10:42.140
 like that will shift dramatically.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.960
 But if you want to see the benefits of both,

10:44.960 --> 10:48.120
 that's probably the effective dose for strength training

10:48.120 --> 10:49.860
 and the effective dose for conditioning

10:49.860 --> 10:51.020
 at the bare minimum level.

10:51.020 --> 10:54.060
 Again, being a much better performer condition wise,

10:54.060 --> 10:55.460
 you're going to want to do more than that.

10:55.460 --> 10:58.180
 And in terms of the duration of those workouts,

10:58.180 --> 10:59.340
 what's your suggestion?

10:59.340 --> 11:01.440
 I've been weight training for about 30 years,

11:01.440 --> 11:06.380
 running for about 30 years, and mainly for health,

11:06.380 --> 11:10.500
 and have found that if I work hard in the gym

11:10.500 --> 11:14.020
 or at resistance training for more than 60 minutes or so,

11:14.020 --> 11:15.420
 it's very hard for me to recover.

11:15.420 --> 11:16.340
 I start getting colds,

11:16.340 --> 11:18.460
 I start getting weaker from workout to workout.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.260
 But amazingly, at least to me,

11:20.260 --> 11:23.540
 if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes of warmup

11:23.540 --> 11:28.020
 and 55 zero minutes or so of really hard work

11:28.020 --> 11:29.500
 for resistance training,

11:29.500 --> 11:31.420
 and I keep the cardiovascular work

11:31.420 --> 11:35.100
 to about 30 to 45 minutes, I feel great.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.060
 And I seem to make some progress,

11:37.060 --> 11:39.900
 at least someplace in the workout from workout to workout.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.200
 Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers

11:42.200 --> 11:43.780
 because those are kind of numbers that we usually preach.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.700
 We try to keep our workouts to an hour or less, if possible.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.180
 Now, depending upon the split that you're following,

11:49.180 --> 11:50.980
 if you're on a total body split,

11:50.980 --> 11:53.040
 there's just going to be more that has to be done

11:53.040 --> 11:54.980
 in a given amount of time.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.380
 That again, if you're training primarily for strength,

11:57.380 --> 11:58.620
 that could prolong the workout

11:58.620 --> 12:00.760
 because the longer rest times in between sets.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.740
 But in general, when you're not focused on that one aspect,

12:03.740 --> 12:05.100
 but the overall health picture,

12:05.100 --> 12:08.820
 then you can get the job done in under an hour.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.420
 And again, I always say,

12:10.420 --> 12:12.220
 on top of if you want to look like an athlete,

12:12.220 --> 12:14.140
 train like an athlete is you can either train long

12:14.140 --> 12:16.020
 or you can train hard, but you can't do both.

12:16.020 --> 12:18.820
 And I really believe that the focus for me,

12:18.820 --> 12:19.660
 I have a busy life,

12:19.660 --> 12:21.820
 I have a lot of other things that I do, believe it or not.

12:21.820 --> 12:25.020
 And it's like, I want to go hard and I want to go get out.

12:25.020 --> 12:27.860
 And I find that my body also responds to that.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.580
 I think a lot of guys' bodies respond to that.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.860
 And particularly as you start to get older,

12:32.860 --> 12:35.720
 I think it's the length of the workout

12:35.720 --> 12:37.860
 that actually causes more problems

12:37.860 --> 12:39.940
 than the intensity of what you're doing.

12:39.940 --> 12:42.420
 Particularly if you're warmed up properly, like you said.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.340
 I've found personally that my warmup

12:44.340 --> 12:46.820
 has had to become more of an integral part of my workout

12:46.820 --> 12:48.300
 than it ever has before.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.040
 I could get in the gym when I was 20

12:51.040 --> 12:53.100
 and I'm going right over, I'm doing the one set,

12:53.100 --> 12:55.260
 two sets, I'm ready to go.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.140
 And I never do another workout warmup set

12:57.140 --> 13:00.140
 for any of the other exercises I do the rest of the day.

13:00.140 --> 13:02.060
 That's not true anymore.

13:02.060 --> 13:03.920
 And I found that as long as I'm willing

13:03.920 --> 13:06.460
 to sort of give myself a little bit of a warmup,

13:06.460 --> 13:08.380
 the intensity is not what bothers me.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.940
 I'm very much in control of the weights that I use

13:10.940 --> 13:12.260
 and it doesn't bother me.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.620
 But if I start to go pretty long,

13:14.620 --> 13:16.620
 I start to feel achy or I start to have problems.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.320
 So again, depending upon age,

13:18.320 --> 13:20.620
 that also plays a factor in the length.

13:20.620 --> 13:23.740
 But again, I think everybody can achieve,

13:23.740 --> 13:26.140
 on a standard program, can achieve the results

13:26.140 --> 13:28.060
 that they want within an hour.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.100
 In terms of splits, you mentioned splits.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.940
 And so for those who aren't familiar with this term, splits,

13:32.940 --> 13:36.620
 it's really which body parts are you training on which days?

13:36.620 --> 13:38.340
 It seems like almost everybody follows

13:38.340 --> 13:40.300
 a weekly workout schedule,

13:40.300 --> 13:42.860
 although the body of course doesn't care about the week.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.740
 There's no reason to think that once every seven days

13:44.740 --> 13:46.860
 or twice every seven days makes sense physiologically,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.020
 it's just the body doesn't work though.

13:48.020 --> 13:51.300
 But that's the way life is structured.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.780
 I've seen you discuss three days a week,

13:54.780 --> 13:57.020
 whole body workouts.

13:57.020 --> 14:00.660
 I've heard of splits like a pushing one day,

14:00.660 --> 14:03.680
 pulling another day, legs another day, a day off, repeat.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.780
 I mean, there's so many variations on this.

14:05.780 --> 14:08.060
 What are some general themes that we can throw out there

14:08.060 --> 14:11.780
 and in order to avoid the huge matrix of possibilities?

14:11.780 --> 14:13.400
 You have some wonderful content that points to those.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.700
 And we will cap, in our caption show notes,

14:15.700 --> 14:17.380
 we will link out to some of those

14:17.380 --> 14:19.420
 that are different ways to design splits.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.660
 But in terms of giving people a logic

14:21.660 --> 14:25.220
 of how to think about splitting up body parts,

14:25.220 --> 14:27.260
 what's governing the split?

14:27.260 --> 14:30.080
 What are the rules and the logic that dictate a split?

14:30.080 --> 14:32.980
 For me, the first rule is will you stick to it, right?

14:32.980 --> 14:34.240
 Like if you, cause there are split,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.940
 I don't particularly like full body splits.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.740
 I was actually talking to Jesse about that the other day.

14:38.740 --> 14:42.380
 Like I don't necessarily like to have to train everything.

14:42.380 --> 14:45.540
 Now, of course the volumes will come down per muscle group.

14:45.540 --> 14:48.340
 But if you don't like to do that

14:48.340 --> 14:50.280
 and you actually don't look forward to your workout

14:50.280 --> 14:52.140
 because you're dreading having to do everything

14:52.140 --> 14:53.920
 and feeling maybe too fatigued

14:53.920 --> 14:55.340
 by the time your workout's over,

14:55.340 --> 14:57.700
 or the fact that those generally do take a little bit longer

14:57.700 --> 14:59.460
 and don't fit into your schedule,

14:59.460 --> 15:01.440
 I don't care how effective the split is.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.340
 A split not done is not effective.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.920
 So you need to find one that fits.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.480
 So maybe you go into an alternative option,

15:07.480 --> 15:09.780
 like a push pull legs, like you mentioned.

15:09.780 --> 15:13.860
 And that could be done either one cycle through the week

15:13.860 --> 15:15.340
 on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,

15:15.340 --> 15:17.180
 or it could be twice in a week.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.700
 So you're actually training six times where you repeat it.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.340
 Pull push legs, pull push legs,

15:22.340 --> 15:24.820
 or however you want to do it,

15:24.820 --> 15:26.980
 with either a day off in between the three days

15:26.980 --> 15:29.220
 or at the end of the six days.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.360
 And again, that actually impacts your schedule.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.340
 I've broken that down before where it's,

15:33.340 --> 15:35.440
 if you put it in between the three days,

15:35.440 --> 15:36.660
 it's good because you're giving yourself

15:36.660 --> 15:38.340
 an extra rest day in between,

15:38.340 --> 15:41.020
 but it starts to shift that day off every week

15:41.020 --> 15:41.860
 as we wrap around.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.940
 So for those guys that were choosing that seven day schedule

15:43.940 --> 15:45.860
 out of convenience in our heads,

15:45.860 --> 15:47.460
 it starts to mess with that off day.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.160
 So others like to just keep it predictably,

15:49.160 --> 15:51.800
 let's say on a Sunday and train six days in a row.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.220
 But that's a better way to maybe group

15:56.220 --> 15:59.120
 similar muscle actions together,

15:59.120 --> 16:01.540
 which I think I definitely prefer that

16:01.540 --> 16:05.020
 because if I'm going to be training, pulling movements,

16:05.020 --> 16:07.100
 at least there's a synergy between them.

16:07.100 --> 16:11.780
 And I feel like I'm looking to achieve one goal that day.

16:11.780 --> 16:13.980
 And then, I mean, quite honestly,

16:13.980 --> 16:16.100
 you can go back to the bro split days

16:16.100 --> 16:18.340
 and those still work effectively.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.500
 There's a reason why they worked in the past.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.700
 Like I think that science shows that there's smarter ways

16:23.700 --> 16:24.840
 to do them these days.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.800
 Like you can come back and hit a related muscle.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.460
 So you could do, let's say biceps on one day

16:30.460 --> 16:32.900
 and then come back two days later and do back,

16:32.900 --> 16:36.740
 realizing again, synergy between the exercises there,

16:36.740 --> 16:38.840
 your biceps are going to get restimulated again.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.020
 So you could figure out ways to make that work.

16:41.020 --> 16:43.100
 But the thing that I think is effective there

16:43.100 --> 16:44.220
 is that tends to be one of the ones

16:44.220 --> 16:46.580
 that people like the most because they can go in,

16:46.580 --> 16:48.760
 they get their pump, they feel good,

16:48.760 --> 16:51.940
 that it's pretty solely focused on one muscle group.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.580
 Is that the definition of a bro split?

16:53.580 --> 16:55.500
 One muscle group a day.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.340
 I see.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.300
 So it's very much geared towards strength and aesthetics,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.700
 really maximizing chest one day.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.500
 Probably more aesthetics than strength.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.340
 Yeah.

17:03.340 --> 17:05.620
 Hence the bro name.

17:05.620 --> 17:08.000
 Yeah, but again, like, and here I am a science guy

17:08.000 --> 17:10.540
 and I could appreciate the benefits of a bro split,

17:10.540 --> 17:13.220
 especially because again, like what, to what end?

17:13.220 --> 17:16.640
 Who's goal are we trying to achieve here?

17:16.640 --> 17:18.020
 Theirs or ours?

17:18.020 --> 17:21.420
 You know, like, I mean, if I'm applying my standards

17:21.420 --> 17:24.540
 and my goals or even like athletic ideals,

17:24.540 --> 17:26.340
 but they just want to get in shape,

17:26.340 --> 17:30.500
 then it's perfectly fine to do a bro split in that instance

17:30.500 --> 17:32.260
 if you're sticking to it again

17:32.260 --> 17:34.540
 and you're seeing the results that you want to see from it.

17:34.540 --> 17:38.620
 But they're able to really keep their focus on one muscle.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.620
 They get to focus on, you know, like look,

17:40.620 --> 17:43.100
 a lot of times people struggle with the way

17:43.100 --> 17:46.100
 of an exercise feels until their second or third set.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
 Like they don't have that proprioceptive ability

17:48.100 --> 17:49.780
 to kind of lock in on an exercise.

17:49.780 --> 17:54.440
 So spending a few, not only sets on the same exercise,

17:54.440 --> 17:55.660
 but then doing another exercise

17:55.660 --> 17:57.260
 with the same muscle group helps them to dial in

17:57.260 --> 17:59.380
 a little bit better and get more out of their training.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.260
 Yeah, that raises a really interesting,

18:01.260 --> 18:02.380
 I think important question.

18:02.380 --> 18:04.660
 Early on when I started resistance training,

18:04.660 --> 18:06.860
 which was when I was 16 in high school,

18:06.860 --> 18:10.860
 I got in touch with, and I was learning from Mike Mentzer.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.580
 Me too, me too, that's crazy.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.800
 And Mike was very helpful, very, very helpful.

18:15.800 --> 18:16.640
 We got to be friendly.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.720
 So if I just read his book,

18:17.720 --> 18:20.340
 I didn't get a chance to be him, so I'm jealous right now.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.820
 Back then, no internet,

18:23.020 --> 18:26.420
 I paid by Western Union type thing to send him some money.

18:26.420 --> 18:27.260
 For the back of the magazine.

18:27.260 --> 18:28.980
 And then he got on the phone with me

18:28.980 --> 18:30.140
 and my mother at the time was like,

18:30.140 --> 18:32.460
 why is this grown man all in the house?

18:32.460 --> 18:34.580
 And he gave me a very straightforward split,

18:34.580 --> 18:35.540
 which was shoulders and arms.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.060
 One day, he had me taking two days off

18:38.060 --> 18:40.140
 and then training legs and then two days off

18:40.140 --> 18:41.260
 and then chest and back, et cetera.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.420
 And that's a variation of a bro split too,

18:43.420 --> 18:45.340
 where you're sort of breaking them down that way,

18:45.340 --> 18:47.340
 chest and back or chest and buys, you know?

18:47.340 --> 18:49.080
 Yeah, and it worked very well for me.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.100
 I probably would have, because of my age, I think,

18:51.100 --> 18:54.180
 and because I was untrained, I think, largely untrained,

18:54.180 --> 18:57.020
 I think it would have grown on many different programs,

18:57.020 --> 18:58.400
 but it worked very well for me.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.260
 I eventually just made that an every other day thing.

19:01.260 --> 19:04.020
 So shoulders and arms, day off, legs, day or two off,

19:04.020 --> 19:06.100
 because if you hit legs right, at least for me,

19:06.100 --> 19:08.300
 I'm not training the next day.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.780
 And then I'm not doing much of anything athletic

19:10.780 --> 19:13.220
 the next day and chest and back and repeat and so on.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.300
 And the reason I found that helpful

19:15.300 --> 19:19.180
 is I almost always recovered between workouts.

19:19.180 --> 19:22.280
 The six day a week program of push, pull, legs,

19:22.280 --> 19:26.040
 push, pull, legs, to me seems excruciating

19:26.040 --> 19:27.100
 from two standpoints.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.020
 One is, at least with my recovery abilities

19:30.020 --> 19:31.340
 or lack of recovery abilities,

19:31.340 --> 19:33.620
 I can't imagine coming back feeling fresh.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.660
 And the other one is if I'm in the gym

19:35.660 --> 19:39.220
 more than four days a week, I really start to fatigue it

19:39.220 --> 19:41.540
 about the whole psychological experience of it.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.940
 Whereas if I'm in there three or four days a week,

19:43.940 --> 19:46.540
 in other words, if I put a day off in between each workout,

19:46.540 --> 19:48.080
 I really want to be there.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.140
 And I get in there with a lot of fire.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.900
 And I'm also doing other things on the off days.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.180
 So I think that I love that you mentioned

19:55.180 --> 19:56.900
 that the split that you'll stick to

19:56.900 --> 19:59.140
 and that you can bring the intensity to,

19:59.140 --> 20:01.220
 because I think that that's really important.

20:01.220 --> 20:03.400
 I sometimes hear about two a day training.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.400
 I've done two a day training twice in my lifetime,

20:05.400 --> 20:08.020
 both times I got sick two days later.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.540
 That's correlation, not causation, you know?

20:10.540 --> 20:13.540
 But is there ever an instance

20:13.540 --> 20:16.060
 where two a day weight training makes sense

20:16.060 --> 20:21.060
 for the non-drug assisted, typical recovery ability person?

20:21.340 --> 20:24.660
 I actually, I think it makes sense in some scenarios,

20:24.660 --> 20:26.220
 but it doesn't make sense practically

20:26.220 --> 20:27.360
 for a lot of people's schedules.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.540
 So like, if you could break down,

20:29.540 --> 20:32.540
 let's say you were going to do even a, you know,

20:32.540 --> 20:35.180
 some version of a total body session,

20:35.180 --> 20:37.740
 or maybe like you're going to do an upper lower split,

20:37.740 --> 20:38.580
 right?

20:38.580 --> 20:42.500
 You could do an upper workout and do the anterior chain

20:42.500 --> 20:45.560
 or the pushing portion of that in one session,

20:45.560 --> 20:47.780
 and then come back and do the pulling session

20:47.780 --> 20:51.100
 later on at night if you had the opportunity to.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.480
 The thing that you benefit from there

20:52.480 --> 20:54.020
 is the freshness of focus.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.820
 Again, like something in my head is sacrificed

20:57.820 --> 20:59.940
 by the time you get towards the latter half

20:59.940 --> 21:01.360
 of whatever workout you're in.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.540
 To the same point you made before,

21:02.540 --> 21:04.720
 like when you start to approach that 50 minutes,

21:04.720 --> 21:07.620
 an hour mark, you are either losing focus,

21:07.620 --> 21:10.020
 you're losing energy, you're losing contractile ability,

21:10.020 --> 21:11.380
 you're losing something.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.180
 And if you're relegating whatever it is,

21:14.180 --> 21:16.660
 the pulling portion of that to the end of that workout,

21:16.660 --> 21:17.500
 something suffers.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.900
 So that, okay, if they realize that's happening,

21:19.900 --> 21:21.060
 then maybe you switch them up

21:21.060 --> 21:22.120
 the next time you do the workout

21:22.120 --> 21:24.700
 where the pulling portion of the upper workout goes first,

21:24.700 --> 21:26.060
 and then the pushing goes later.

21:26.060 --> 21:29.540
 So you're at least not just continuing that cycle.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.420
 But at the same time, if you were able

21:31.420 --> 21:33.180
 to kind of split them up,

21:33.180 --> 21:34.840
 you get a chance to kind of take a break,

21:34.840 --> 21:36.820
 you can have that freshness of focus again,

21:36.820 --> 21:38.620
 and you can actually get a better effort in.

21:38.620 --> 21:40.720
 Because again, I think effort drives the results.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.620
 So if the effort is not compromised,

21:42.620 --> 21:44.020
 then you should be able to do that.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.980
 But systemically, is that a problem?

21:46.980 --> 21:48.860
 And I think that it is a problem for a lot of people.

21:48.860 --> 21:51.620
 It's just hard to, it's hard to rev the engine up

21:51.620 --> 21:53.020
 a lot of times during the day.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.460
 You warm that thing up once,

21:54.460 --> 21:55.500
 it's like that car in the winter,

21:55.500 --> 21:57.000
 you get it going once, you're lucky.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.740
 Okay, now you got to drive it the rest of the day.

21:58.740 --> 22:01.500
 But you put it in the garage

22:01.500 --> 22:04.080
 and try to start the next day, it's a problem.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.740
 So, young people can get away with a lot more

22:06.740 --> 22:08.860
 than older people could, you know?

22:08.860 --> 22:10.780
 Well, I've never had a strong recovery quotient.

22:10.780 --> 22:13.180
 But if I stick to this one day off in between,

22:13.180 --> 22:15.480
 every once in a while, two days in a row training,

22:15.480 --> 22:16.740
 maybe because I have to travel

22:16.740 --> 22:18.220
 and I want to make sure I get all the workouts

22:18.220 --> 22:20.260
 and kind of thing, I seem to be okay.

22:20.260 --> 22:21.940
 I like your example of warming up the car,

22:21.940 --> 22:25.100
 spoken like a true East Coast or those of us

22:25.100 --> 22:27.100
 from the West Coast, took a moment there.

22:27.100 --> 22:31.500
 But folks from the East Coast and the Midwest get it,

22:31.500 --> 22:33.100
 and certainly from Europe.

22:33.960 --> 22:38.960
 In terms of the mixing up of cardiovascular training

22:39.380 --> 22:44.020
 and resistance training, same day, different day,

22:44.020 --> 22:47.280
 which one should come first, which one should come second?

22:47.280 --> 22:49.700
 If one's main goals, again,

22:49.700 --> 22:51.260
 everyone listening has different goals,

22:51.260 --> 22:53.100
 are most people would like to either maintain

22:53.100 --> 22:54.540
 or gain some muscle.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.460
 I don't know many people that want to lose muscle.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.700
 Maintain or gain some muscle,

22:57.700 --> 23:00.360
 usually in specific locations on their body.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.980
 Most people would like to be a bit leaner or a lot leaner.

23:02.980 --> 23:03.920
 There are a few people out there

23:03.920 --> 23:05.680
 that are either naturally lean

23:05.680 --> 23:07.460
 or actually just want to gain weight.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.180
 But assuming that people want to get leaner,

23:09.180 --> 23:10.820
 put on some muscle, maintain muscle,

23:10.820 --> 23:13.900
 and want to have a healthy heart and a healthy brain,

23:13.900 --> 23:17.040
 which basically requires a healthy cardiovascular system,

23:17.040 --> 23:20.020
 how would you incorporate cardiovascular work

23:20.020 --> 23:22.860
 into the overall weekly regimen?

23:22.860 --> 23:26.300
 So again, I think that the bare minimum

23:26.300 --> 23:28.780
 is probably twice a week in terms of cardiovascular,

23:28.780 --> 23:30.300
 if you want to have some semblance

23:30.300 --> 23:31.460
 of cardiovascular conditioning.

23:31.460 --> 23:33.940
 But I think most people who actually need it more

23:33.940 --> 23:36.020
 or want to pursue it more than that

23:36.020 --> 23:37.800
 are going to need more time to do that.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.860
 So at some point it can't just be relegated to a day off

23:41.860 --> 23:44.780
 or a day off from the weight training workouts.

23:44.780 --> 23:48.260
 So at some point it has to occur on the same day.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.700
 And in that case, I just like to put it,

23:50.700 --> 23:52.920
 if that is not your primary goal,

23:52.920 --> 23:56.020
 but you're looking more for just the overall picture,

23:56.020 --> 23:56.940
 the aesthetics you mentioned,

23:56.940 --> 23:58.660
 putting muscle on in certain areas,

23:58.660 --> 24:00.260
 then I would put it at the end of the workout.

24:00.260 --> 24:02.700
 Because you don't want to in any way compromise

24:02.700 --> 24:03.980
 the weight training workout.

24:03.980 --> 24:06.460
 And as we've sort of referenced a couple of times already,

24:06.460 --> 24:08.660
 the intensity of those workouts is important.

24:08.660 --> 24:12.140
 And we know there's a strength component to those workouts

24:12.140 --> 24:17.020
 also that is going to be a helpful stimulus for growth.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.420
 So the conditioning, the cardio,

24:19.420 --> 24:23.520
 that stuff done prior to any strength training workout

24:23.520 --> 24:25.620
 is likely going to impair your ability

24:25.620 --> 24:27.100
 to perform at your best.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.260
 So unless it's just done for a quick little warmup

24:29.260 --> 24:31.420
 in the beginning, but then it's not sustained long enough

24:31.420 --> 24:34.060
 really to be a benefit for cardiovascular conditioning.

24:34.060 --> 24:37.760
 So I just like to put that at the end,

24:37.760 --> 24:42.340
 realizing that even if my effort level is lower,

24:42.340 --> 24:43.860
 my output is lower,

24:43.860 --> 24:47.800
 if it's still placing a demand on my cardiac output

24:47.800 --> 24:50.980
 to get that conditioning effect because I'm fatigued,

24:50.980 --> 24:52.740
 it still has a demand on my cardiac output.

24:52.740 --> 24:54.100
 So it's still achieving its goal,

24:54.100 --> 24:56.300
 but it didn't interfere with my main goal

24:56.300 --> 24:58.740
 of being able to increase my performance in the gym.

24:58.740 --> 24:59.580
 Got it.

24:59.580 --> 25:02.220
 And in terms of the form of cardiovascular training,

25:02.220 --> 25:06.140
 I've seen you do a number of, I have to say,

25:06.140 --> 25:09.160
 very impressive high intensity interval type work.

25:09.160 --> 25:14.080
 So burpee type work or pushups with crunches mixed into them.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.780
 Anyway, people can see your videos too.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.740
 I didn't describe those in the best way,

25:17.740 --> 25:20.940
 but rather than on the treadmill

25:20.940 --> 25:22.940
 or out jogging for 30, 45 minutes,

25:22.940 --> 25:25.960
 is that because you prefer higher intensity,

25:25.960 --> 25:28.220
 higher heart rate type training

25:28.220 --> 25:30.420
 or is it because you live in cold Connecticut

25:31.380 --> 25:33.260
 and you don't want to be out jogging on the roads

25:33.260 --> 25:35.100
 in the middle of winter?

25:35.100 --> 25:36.260
 I think all of the above.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.460
 I mean, those are factors from a personal level,

25:38.460 --> 25:43.460
 but I think that if we could blend function

25:43.460 --> 25:48.520
 across these realms and not have such a delineation

25:48.520 --> 25:49.920
 between this is my weight training

25:49.920 --> 25:51.420
 and this is my conditioning,

25:51.420 --> 25:54.280
 but figure out a way to blend them together,

25:54.280 --> 25:56.780
 I always think that you've got a better opportunity

25:56.780 --> 25:59.600
 to get that more well-rounded result.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.420
 And I like to kind of mix up that straight conditioning work

26:03.420 --> 26:05.720
 and also some of the footwork drills.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.040
 Like we have some high expectations for guys

26:08.040 --> 26:09.300
 that come into our programs,

26:09.300 --> 26:11.600
 like to just do some footwork drills.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.440
 Like ladders.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.360
 Ladders or line drills or something.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.200
 And you know what happens?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.960
 People become intrigued and interested.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.400
 Like, I never, I haven't tried this since high school.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.600
 And they become interested in just the challenge of it.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.400
 And as we become almost distracted by the challenge,

26:26.400 --> 26:28.880
 we're now like finding ourselves conditioning.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.360
 And I always think that's an important part

26:31.360 --> 26:33.400
 that sometimes you got to draw people in

26:34.960 --> 26:36.840
 to show them what they might be interested in.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.120
 And from the output or the effect of it,

26:39.120 --> 26:41.660
 I just think that when you're able to blend some,

26:41.660 --> 26:44.280
 still maintain some of that strength training

26:44.280 --> 26:45.400
 into the exercise.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.240
 So as you mentioned,

26:46.240 --> 26:47.840
 let's say I'm doing some kind of a pushup or a burpee.

26:47.840 --> 26:52.000
 I mean, there is an anaerobic component to that

26:52.000 --> 26:54.080
 that is going to be helpful

26:54.080 --> 26:56.800
 rather than just walking or just jogging.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.580
 Not to say that that isn't an effective means

27:00.580 --> 27:03.500
 for strict cardiac conditioning.

27:03.500 --> 27:07.700
 It's one of the ways that we've had for centuries to do it.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.180
 But I just think that if we can blend it,

27:10.180 --> 27:12.480
 then it becomes maybe a little bit more interesting

27:12.480 --> 27:14.680
 and you get some of those crossover benefits

27:14.680 --> 27:16.280
 and it doesn't become so segmented

27:16.280 --> 27:17.960
 in terms of what we're trying to do.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.680
 I love the idea of bringing some mental challenge

27:20.680 --> 27:23.540
 and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.320
 That's not something that I've thought of before.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.920
 And it's simply because I've overlooked it,

27:26.920 --> 27:29.840
 but it makes sense because my sister who's reasonably fit,

27:29.840 --> 27:32.560
 although I'm always trying to get her to do a bit more,

27:32.560 --> 27:34.400
 she always asks me, what should I take?

27:34.400 --> 27:36.520
 And I believe her in supplements

27:36.520 --> 27:38.160
 for certain people in certain instances,

27:38.160 --> 27:41.840
 but I keep telling her, behaviors are going to,

27:41.840 --> 27:43.320
 and nutrition are going to have

27:43.320 --> 27:45.720
 the greatest outsized positive effect.

27:45.720 --> 27:50.040
 And she loves things like dance classes and things

27:50.040 --> 27:52.080
 or kickboxing, these kinds of things.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.640
 So it makes sense that if you can hook somebody

27:54.640 --> 27:56.800
 on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect

27:56.800 --> 27:58.960
 and kind of trick them into doing more cardio,

27:58.960 --> 28:00.600
 so to speak, that's terrific.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.940
 Also, the neuroscientist in me just has to say, forgive me,

28:04.800 --> 28:06.480
 that anytime you're engaging

28:06.480 --> 28:09.280
 the two sets of motor neurons, the ones in your brain,

28:09.280 --> 28:11.080
 the upper motor neurons and the ones in your spinal cord,

28:11.080 --> 28:12.740
 anytime you're engaging those upper motor neurons,

28:12.740 --> 28:15.900
 which are for deliberate, well-controlled action,

28:15.900 --> 28:17.920
 you're doing a great thing for your brain

28:17.920 --> 28:19.120
 in terms of brain longevity.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.880
 So now I need to incorporate some actual skills

28:22.880 --> 28:23.800
 into my training.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.240
 Going back to weight training a bit,

28:27.240 --> 28:30.520
 one of the most important things I learned from you

28:31.480 --> 28:34.960
 over the years was that when training

28:34.960 --> 28:38.080
 to increase muscle size, to really think

28:38.080 --> 28:39.720
 not so much about moving weights,

28:39.720 --> 28:41.960
 but more about challenging muscles.

28:41.960 --> 28:45.280
 I also heard this from my friend Ben Pakulski,

28:45.280 --> 28:48.000
 who's a very well-accomplished, he was a bodybuilder now,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.320
 he's into other aspects of fitness, teaches fitness,

28:50.320 --> 28:52.400
 but don't move weights, challenge muscles,

28:52.400 --> 28:53.800
 unless you're trying to power lift

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
 or something of that sort, which I'm not.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.360
 Immensely helpful.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.280
 But the other thing that I learned from you

28:59.280 --> 29:02.800
 that I combined with that was this idea

29:02.800 --> 29:06.080
 that certain muscles will grow better

29:06.080 --> 29:07.840
 and get stronger much more easily,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.800
 maybe even will recover better

29:09.800 --> 29:12.560
 because of our ability to contract them really hard.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.620
 And this, what I call the cavalier test,

29:14.620 --> 29:19.080
 which is, at least if I could paraphrase,

29:19.080 --> 29:23.320
 so for instance, if I can, it's always the bicep, isn't it?

29:23.320 --> 29:25.240
 Let's use the calf or the bicep.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.920
 If you can flex your bicep to the point

29:27.920 --> 29:29.640
 where it hurts a little bit,

29:29.640 --> 29:31.600
 like it almost feels like a cramp or a cramp,

29:31.600 --> 29:32.880
 or you can flex your calf to the point

29:32.880 --> 29:34.280
 where it really cramps up a little bit,

29:34.280 --> 29:36.000
 it almost feels like it's nodding up,

29:36.000 --> 29:37.480
 that's a pretty good indication

29:37.480 --> 29:38.320
 that you're going to be able

29:38.320 --> 29:41.800
 to stimulate that muscle well under load

29:41.800 --> 29:43.800
 if you're doing the movement properly.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.440
 And that's the feeling to actually aim for each repetition,

29:46.440 --> 29:48.920
 maybe even throughout the repetition.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.480
 For me, this completely transformed my results.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.520
 And this was, I think maybe five, six years ago

29:54.520 --> 29:55.880
 that I first heard this from you,

29:55.880 --> 29:58.480
 body parts that for me lagged behind

29:58.480 --> 30:01.000
 that I thought maybe genetically weren't gonna work for me

30:01.000 --> 30:04.160
 immediately just started growing, right?

30:04.160 --> 30:06.120
 And I was getting stronger and stronger,

30:06.120 --> 30:07.560
 and I thought this is really something,

30:07.560 --> 30:11.160
 so much so that I've dedicated a portion of my research

30:11.160 --> 30:13.600
 along with in collaboration with another group

30:13.600 --> 30:16.000
 to try and understand what's happening

30:16.000 --> 30:18.040
 in these upper motor neurons in the brain

30:18.040 --> 30:20.200
 that can engage the muscles even more.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.660
 And that it's not just about progressive overload

30:22.660 --> 30:25.200
 or putting a pump into the muscle,

30:25.200 --> 30:28.080
 that it's really this mind-muscle connection

30:28.080 --> 30:30.640
 is a real thing when it comes to predicting results

30:30.640 --> 30:32.400
 and that you can get better at it.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.840
 So forgive me for paraphrasing

30:34.840 --> 30:36.320
 your incredible content around this.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.660
 It made a tremendous difference for me

30:38.660 --> 30:40.960
 and a number of other people that I've passed that along to.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.060
 But what can you, first of all, how did you arrive at that?

30:45.120 --> 30:46.780
 Because we hear about the mind-muscle connection,

30:46.780 --> 30:48.560
 but I really heard it first from you.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.360
 How did you arrive at this kind of cramp test,

30:50.360 --> 30:52.560
 the cavalier test as I'll call it?

30:52.560 --> 30:53.720
 It's always weird when people name things

30:53.720 --> 30:55.000
 after themselves in science,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.840
 but other scientists can name things.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.860
 So there is now officially the cavalier test

30:58.860 --> 31:01.120
 is whether or not you can cramp the muscle

31:01.120 --> 31:03.360
 in the absence of load, just flexing it

31:03.360 --> 31:04.640
 to the point where it hurts a little bit.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.840
 That would be a good indication

31:06.840 --> 31:08.800
 that you could grow that muscle well.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.860
 So how did you come up with this?

31:10.860 --> 31:14.940
 I mean, honestly, it's something that made sense to me

31:14.940 --> 31:17.440
 because during my workouts,

31:17.440 --> 31:20.340
 even as a young kid, just starting out,

31:20.340 --> 31:22.600
 I always wanted to know what is it working?

31:22.600 --> 31:24.760
 A lot of people ask that question more so than you think.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.280
 What is this supposed to work?

31:26.280 --> 31:28.720
 And I don't know if you've ever noticed,

31:28.720 --> 31:30.400
 but like when people ask that question,

31:30.400 --> 31:32.240
 if they're being trained by a trainer

31:32.240 --> 31:34.500
 and the trainer is saying, well, just do this,

31:34.500 --> 31:37.040
 do this exercise and they'll show you how to do it.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.280
 But then they'll say, but what is it supposed to work?

31:39.280 --> 31:40.840
 Where am I supposed to feel this, right?

31:40.840 --> 31:43.560
 People, did they just inherently ask that question?

31:43.560 --> 31:45.080
 A lot of people will.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.400
 I was one of those that did that and I asked that question

31:47.400 --> 31:48.440
 not because I knew what I was doing,

31:48.440 --> 31:49.600
 but just because I don't know,

31:49.600 --> 31:53.200
 I wanted to know what was supposed to be doing the work.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.000
 Once you do that and you start to seek that out and say,

31:56.000 --> 31:57.680
 okay, well, the bicep is what's supposed

31:57.680 --> 31:59.240
 to be doing the work,

31:59.240 --> 32:01.740
 then I want to make sure the bicep's doing the work, right?

32:01.740 --> 32:05.040
 So then I would just sort of really tweak the movement

32:05.040 --> 32:07.720
 to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable

32:07.720 --> 32:09.040
 or get a stronger contraction,

32:09.040 --> 32:11.040
 knowing if that's supposed to do the job.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.300
 It wasn't until PT school that I'm learning,

32:13.300 --> 32:15.920
 oh, well, flexion of the elbow is the brachialis

32:15.920 --> 32:18.840
 and the biceps and the biceps responsible for supination.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.440
 I learned other components of it,

32:20.440 --> 32:23.360
 but all I wanted to know was to bring my arm up in a curl,

32:23.360 --> 32:25.000
 what is supposed to do the job?

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
 So I would seek out ways to make that happen better.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.720
 And when I was able to do that,

32:31.720 --> 32:33.740
 I could feel the stronger contraction.

32:33.740 --> 32:36.240
 And I just, I don't know what, I just, I was no visionary.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.760
 I just felt like I knew that that was going to be better

32:38.760 --> 32:40.840
 for me if the muscle I was trying to grow

32:40.840 --> 32:43.240
 was being stressed more effectively.

32:43.240 --> 32:47.120
 So when I was attempting to do this

32:47.120 --> 32:48.680
 across different exercises,

32:48.680 --> 32:51.640
 I would notice that what I could do potentially

32:51.640 --> 32:54.520
 on a curl where my arm is up,

32:54.520 --> 32:57.440
 where you asked me to flex my bicep, that position,

32:57.440 --> 33:00.880
 I couldn't do if I was doing a concentration curl,

33:00.880 --> 33:03.760
 or I couldn't carry over to a cable curl.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.200
 And that shouldn't really change, right?

33:06.200 --> 33:08.480
 Cause the function is still largely the same.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.880
 There's still elbow flexion, there's still supination.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.300
 Like why am I not able to do it there?

33:13.300 --> 33:16.120
 And that's where it sort of clued into me that like,

33:16.120 --> 33:19.840
 your mind muscle connection on not just your mind

33:19.840 --> 33:22.680
 with one muscle, but on every exercise matters.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.140
 And it varies from exercise to exercise.

33:25.140 --> 33:28.440
 And even if you don't gain muscle size from doing that,

33:28.440 --> 33:30.320
 although I think it's very hard not to,

33:30.320 --> 33:32.360
 especially if you're not used to doing that,

33:32.360 --> 33:35.400
 there's a term I like to call muscularity,

33:35.400 --> 33:36.720
 which is a difference, right?

33:36.720 --> 33:39.320
 It's the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.440
 That improves dramatically.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.160
 If you can learn how to just start

33:43.160 --> 33:46.760
 to engage that muscle better,

33:46.760 --> 33:50.280
 the muscularity, the resting tone of that muscle is harder.

33:50.280 --> 33:55.280
 It's more at attention, it's more alive, you know?

33:55.680 --> 33:59.020
 And it's all driven from being able to connect better

33:59.020 --> 34:02.040
 neurologically with the muscle that you're trying to train.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.340
 I've talked about a lot,

34:03.340 --> 34:06.660
 inefficiency is really what you're trying to seek

34:06.660 --> 34:09.420
 in movements when you're trying to create hypertrophy.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.960
 When strength is your goal,

34:10.960 --> 34:13.000
 efficiency of the movement is what you're looking for.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.440
 You're looking to have muscles tied together

34:15.440 --> 34:17.000
 and work well, efficiently,

34:17.000 --> 34:18.760
 the chest, the shoulders, the triceps,

34:18.760 --> 34:21.200
 to get a bar off of your chest or in a bench press.

34:21.200 --> 34:24.640
 You're not looking to make it a very inefficient,

34:24.640 --> 34:26.400
 you know, leverages for your chest

34:26.400 --> 34:28.480
 to try to grow your chest in a bench press.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.120
 You're trying to let the whole package come together

34:31.120 --> 34:32.300
 for a greater output.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.020
 But when you're trying to go and create muscle hypertrophy,

34:35.020 --> 34:37.160
 or even this muscularity that I talk about,

34:37.160 --> 34:40.120
 you need to seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable.

34:40.120 --> 34:40.960
 Right?

34:40.960 --> 34:41.920
 If you don't feel the discomfort,

34:41.920 --> 34:43.280
 then you're doing something wrong.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.320
 And I struggle to this day on certain muscle groups

34:46.320 --> 34:48.920
 to still do that, even knowing what I'm trying to work

34:48.920 --> 34:51.720
 and knowing what the goal of everything I'm preaching here.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.440
 It's very difficult for some muscles

34:53.440 --> 34:55.520
 and for certain people to do this on certain muscles.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.820
 But as you mentioned, practice does help.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.040
 And the more you become, you know,

35:01.040 --> 35:03.400
 consistent and deliberate with what you're trying to do,

35:03.400 --> 35:05.900
 the more of a result you actually get.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.480
 It's a couple of really important points

35:08.480 --> 35:11.040
 I'd like to delve into further.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.840
 First of all, my hunch was always that the muscle groups

35:15.840 --> 35:19.720
 that grew most easily and that I could contract hardest

35:19.720 --> 35:22.840
 without any, the first time I did the Cavalier test

35:22.840 --> 35:25.060
 got 10 out of 10, if we give it a 10 out of 10 scale.

35:25.060 --> 35:27.160
 You know, it could just like cinch, isolate those muscles,

35:27.160 --> 35:28.840
 cinch them, grow them easily.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.560
 I mean, there's certain body parts I don't want to say

35:30.560 --> 35:32.480
 which ones, because it doesn't really matter,

35:32.480 --> 35:34.560
 that I always felt like if I just did pushups,

35:34.560 --> 35:36.320
 they would grow and these muscles are far away

35:36.320 --> 35:37.160
 from any of the muscles

35:37.160 --> 35:38.460
 that are supposed to be involved in pushups.

35:38.460 --> 35:41.200
 Even though I like to think I'm doing pushups correctly.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.720
 You'll tell me if I'm not.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.140
 But some of that I think is genetic

35:46.140 --> 35:48.320
 and some of that has to do with the sports

35:48.320 --> 35:49.760
 that I played when I was younger.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.040
 So I swam, I played soccer, I skateboard.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.120
 And then later I boxed.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.080
 And so the muscles involved in those sports

35:56.080 --> 35:58.080
 were always very easy to engage

35:58.080 --> 36:00.280
 later when I went into the gym.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.640
 So I guess perhaps a call to parents, you know,

36:03.640 --> 36:06.560
 having kids do a lot of dynamic activity

36:06.560 --> 36:08.280
 seems like it might be a good idea.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.440
 The other thing is this issue of muscularity.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.840
 I am so glad you brought that up.

36:12.840 --> 36:16.440
 There are, I have to imagine, a large number of listeners

36:16.440 --> 36:17.960
 who don't want to get bigger.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.320
 They don't want to take up a larger clothing size.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.360
 They don't want to take up more space.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.160
 In fact, some of them would like to take up less space,

36:25.160 --> 36:28.440
 but they want that quality that you're describing,

36:28.440 --> 36:30.800
 which is that, you know, oftentimes you hear it more

36:30.800 --> 36:32.920
 in the, here I'm stereotyping a bit,

36:32.920 --> 36:35.000
 but with kindness, you know,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.400
 you hear from women who are having weight training,

36:37.400 --> 36:38.980
 they say, I don't want to get big often.

36:38.980 --> 36:39.820
 Sometimes they do.

36:39.820 --> 36:41.800
 But most women that I've helped weight train

36:41.800 --> 36:42.800
 or talked to about weight training say,

36:42.800 --> 36:44.440
 I don't want to get big, I want to get toned.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.080
 And I think what they're referring to

36:46.080 --> 36:48.640
 is this quality of muscularity,

36:48.640 --> 36:52.000
 this idea that at resting or at close to rest

36:52.000 --> 36:54.080
 or anytime someone reaches out and grabs a glass,

36:54.080 --> 36:55.520
 that the muscles almost look like

36:55.520 --> 36:57.360
 they're kind of twitching underneath the skin.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.560
 And yet it's not Saran wrap skin, anatomy chart type skin.

37:02.080 --> 37:06.000
 So this thing of muscularity or resting tone,

37:06.000 --> 37:07.640
 you know, has a physiological basis.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.680
 I think it's how readily the nerves

37:09.680 --> 37:11.240
 are communicating with the muscles.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.560
 And you're saying that by learning

37:13.560 --> 37:15.600
 to engage the muscles more actively,

37:15.600 --> 37:18.240
 the resting tone or muscularity can improve.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.480
 Have you seen that both in men and women?

37:20.480 --> 37:21.300
 Yeah. Oh yeah.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.780
 And do you think this is something

37:22.780 --> 37:25.960
 that takes upkeep, maintenance,

37:25.960 --> 37:28.240
 or that, you know, once you develop that in a muscle,

37:28.240 --> 37:29.640
 you can just kind of let it coast?

37:29.640 --> 37:32.820
 So I think like everything that requires upkeep,

37:32.820 --> 37:35.520
 you know, use or lose it, I do believe firmly.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.400
 But like, I think that it's the development

37:38.400 --> 37:39.540
 of the connection is going to be harder

37:39.540 --> 37:41.160
 than the maintenance of the connection.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.880
 As I said, I still struggle to this day for myself

37:43.880 --> 37:47.040
 with, you know, unnamed muscle groups, you know, also,

37:47.040 --> 37:51.800
 you know, but like, you know, there's just certain areas

37:51.800 --> 37:54.660
 that are harder for your brain for whatever reason

37:54.660 --> 37:57.820
 to just develop that connection at that type of level

37:57.820 --> 38:00.640
 to create that extra strong contraction.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.440
 But I think that with proper dedication and focus,

38:04.440 --> 38:06.120
 and I'll go right out and say, you know,

38:06.120 --> 38:08.680
 calves is one of the areas that I don't necessarily

38:08.680 --> 38:09.680
 have a great connection with.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.320
 And I also obviously must not care so much

38:12.320 --> 38:14.040
 because I don't put in the time and effort

38:14.040 --> 38:18.320
 to create that connection as I could.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.840
 So I think what might happen is, you know, yeah,

38:20.840 --> 38:21.880
 there could be a struggle there,

38:21.880 --> 38:24.240
 but then with struggle comes disinterest.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.320
 You're like, well, screw it, I'm a calf knot

38:26.320 --> 38:27.640
 and I'm not going to do anything about it, you know.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.600
 So I think if you put the required effort in

38:31.600 --> 38:34.040
 and the time and repetitions that you will develop that

38:34.040 --> 38:35.080
 and once you do develop it,

38:35.080 --> 38:37.440
 it's going to stick around a lot longer than it would

38:37.440 --> 38:40.320
 had you not invested any time into it at all.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.840
 You know, not requiring as much of that.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.600
 But I mean, I don't know, like, you know,

38:43.600 --> 38:47.000
 you mentioned now when you train, it's like,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.720
 you're just, this is just part of how you train now.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.720
 Like you're going hard, you're trying to, you know,

38:51.720 --> 38:53.440
 really forcefully contract.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.280
 You're not just moving the weight,

38:55.280 --> 38:57.060
 I say from point A to point B,

38:57.060 --> 38:59.400
 but you're like trying to contract the weight

38:59.400 --> 39:01.200
 through that range.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.280
 That is a mindset that I try to put into

39:04.280 --> 39:05.480
 what everything I'm doing,

39:05.480 --> 39:08.240
 unless of course I'm focused on a strength exercise

39:08.240 --> 39:11.120
 where I'm just trying to lift a greater amount

39:11.120 --> 39:12.840
 and use all the muscles together.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.680
 But when the goal is inefficiency for hypertrophy,

39:15.680 --> 39:19.720
 I am really trying to create that contraction

39:19.720 --> 39:21.360
 and it's just part of my training.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.920
 So I guess that, you know, for consistency's sake,

39:24.920 --> 39:26.760
 as long as I'm training, it's happening.

39:26.760 --> 39:28.660
 You know, if I get away from training,

39:28.660 --> 39:29.520
 then it's not happening at all.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.760
 But you know, even there, I probably,

39:31.760 --> 39:33.000
 another embarrassing admission,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.520
 probably will mindfully do it throughout the day,

39:35.520 --> 39:37.200
 even with the weight in my hand, you know,

39:37.200 --> 39:39.760
 in certain muscle groups, whether it be my abs or my arm

39:39.760 --> 39:40.960
 or my shoulders or something,

39:40.960 --> 39:43.000
 I'm doing something just to sort of engage the muscles.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.660
 And I do think that some of that sort of inane practice

39:46.660 --> 39:48.900
 actually helps by the time you go back into the gym.

39:48.900 --> 39:52.240
 You just kind of keep that connection going.

39:52.240 --> 39:55.320
 Well, it certainly obeys all the rules of neuroplasticity.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.880
 You know, the fire together, wire together mantra,

39:57.880 --> 40:01.080
 which is the words of my colleague, Karla Schatz,

40:01.080 --> 40:03.440
 hold true for all aspects of neural function,

40:03.440 --> 40:05.080
 including nerve to muscle.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.680
 So these flexing throughout the day

40:06.680 --> 40:10.600
 or the deliberate isolation of contracting a muscle

40:10.600 --> 40:12.760
 throughout the day is without question

40:12.760 --> 40:14.040
 engaging neuroplasticity.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.880
 And if you were to do fewer of those repetitions,

40:15.880 --> 40:17.400
 you're going to get less engagement

40:17.400 --> 40:18.840
 of the nerve to muscle connection.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.140
 I can say this with a smile and with confidence,

40:22.140 --> 40:23.560
 because one of the first things

40:23.560 --> 40:24.880
 all neuroscience students learn

40:24.880 --> 40:26.480
 is about the neuromuscular junction,

40:26.480 --> 40:28.880
 because it's a really simple example

40:28.880 --> 40:30.780
 of where the more times the nerve fires

40:30.780 --> 40:32.240
 and gets the muscle to contract,

40:32.240 --> 40:33.560
 the stronger that connection gets.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.420
 Receptors are brought there, et cetera, et cetera.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.000
 There's a whole bunch of mechanisms

40:37.000 --> 40:39.160
 for the topic of another podcast.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.660
 But basically that practice throughout the day

40:43.660 --> 40:45.920
 makes total sense and works.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.280
 Yeah, and there's no, believe me,

40:47.280 --> 40:48.720
 there's no science behind that

40:48.720 --> 40:50.440
 in terms of the application of it.

40:50.440 --> 40:53.400
 You do it when you catch yourself doing it

40:53.400 --> 40:54.240
 from time to time.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.600
 But it is definitely something that's easily done discreetly

40:57.600 --> 40:59.200
 and you wind up doing it.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.120
 I actually, I think in a recent video

41:01.120 --> 41:05.020
 when I did talk about growing your arms

41:05.020 --> 41:07.320
 by just improving the connection,

41:07.320 --> 41:09.160
 not that that connection itself

41:09.160 --> 41:11.800
 is applying any load or resistance

41:11.800 --> 41:13.960
 that's significant to create overload for growth,

41:13.960 --> 41:16.280
 but it's the development of that connection

41:16.280 --> 41:18.080
 that I then take back with me into the gym

41:18.080 --> 41:19.440
 at a more effective level

41:19.440 --> 41:21.120
 that takes every exercise I do there

41:21.120 --> 41:22.160
 and makes it more effective.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.880
 That's like sharpening the blade, so to speak.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.440
 Yeah, certainly obeys the laws

41:27.440 --> 41:29.660
 of nerve to muscle physiology.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.220
 Want to just touch on a couple of things.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.320
 If the goal is to challenge muscles

41:36.320 --> 41:39.560
 and one is dividing their body into, let's say,

41:39.560 --> 41:41.480
 a three or four day a week split or so,

41:41.480 --> 41:42.760
 or maybe up to six,

41:44.200 --> 41:46.240
 how do you know when a muscle

41:46.240 --> 41:48.080
 is ready to be challenged again?

41:48.080 --> 41:50.200
 I've heard, okay, every 48 hours

41:50.200 --> 41:52.260
 as protein synthesis increases,

41:52.260 --> 41:54.720
 and then we'll get into this, and then it drops off.

41:54.720 --> 41:59.520
 But frankly, if I train my legs hard,

41:59.520 --> 42:01.680
 I can get stronger from workout to workout,

42:01.680 --> 42:03.320
 or at least better in some way,

42:03.320 --> 42:06.280
 workout to workout, leg workout to leg workout,

42:06.280 --> 42:09.480
 training them once every five to eight days.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.920
 If I train them more often, I get worse.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.200
 So whatever that 48 hour to 72 hour thing is,

42:17.200 --> 42:19.720
 somehow my legs don't obey that,

42:19.720 --> 42:21.400
 or maybe something else is wrong with me,

42:21.400 --> 42:23.600
 but I'm sure there are many things else wrong with me.

42:23.600 --> 42:27.920
 But how do you assess recovery at the local level,

42:27.920 --> 42:29.480
 meaning at the level of the muscles?

42:29.480 --> 42:32.180
 So we'll talk about soreness and getting better,

42:32.180 --> 42:33.960
 stronger, more repetitions, et cetera.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.360
 And then the systemic level,

42:35.360 --> 42:36.840
 the level of the nervous system.

42:36.840 --> 42:39.800
 And I'd love for you to tell us about the tool

42:39.800 --> 42:40.980
 that, again, I learned from you,

42:40.980 --> 42:43.240
 which is actually using a physical scale,

42:43.240 --> 42:45.000
 because it turns out,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.560
 that will let you tell what the tool is,

42:47.560 --> 42:50.640
 but that tool is also actively being used

42:50.640 --> 42:54.400
 for assessing cognitive decline and cognitive maintenance

42:54.400 --> 42:55.360
 and cognitive function

42:55.360 --> 42:57.860
 in people with Alzheimer's and dementia.

42:57.860 --> 42:59.200
 Makes total sense.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.040
 Makes total sense.

43:00.040 --> 43:05.040
 All right, so regarding the first part of the question,

43:06.040 --> 43:08.200
 like, how would you kind of dictate

43:08.200 --> 43:09.580
 when a muscle is recovered?

43:09.580 --> 43:12.080
 So I do think that what you're experiencing

43:12.080 --> 43:14.500
 is totally real,

43:14.500 --> 43:17.240
 that different muscles recover at different rates.

43:17.240 --> 43:21.120
 And I've always been so fascinated by this concept.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.000
 I've talked about internally with my team,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.840
 but like, I feel like what we really need,

43:25.840 --> 43:29.440
 the holy grail to training is going to be

43:29.440 --> 43:32.640
 when we're able to crack the code on an individual basis,

43:32.640 --> 43:34.840
 when a muscle is recovered,

43:34.840 --> 43:37.560
 and that is going to dictate its training schedule.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.940
 And the fact that you might have a bicep

43:40.940 --> 43:44.420
 that could be trained via a pulling workout,

43:44.420 --> 43:45.780
 a regular bicep dedicated workout,

43:45.780 --> 43:46.780
 forget the split at the moment,

43:46.780 --> 43:49.100
 you might have a bicep that's able to be trained

43:49.100 --> 43:51.780
 that can be trained again the next day,

43:52.920 --> 43:53.760
 and then the next day,

43:53.760 --> 43:55.240
 and then maybe you need a day off after that.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.840
 But like, in that,

43:56.840 --> 43:59.160
 that can vary from person to person for sure.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.800
 And it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person

44:01.800 --> 44:04.280
 over the course of time, as you mentioned,

44:04.280 --> 44:06.500
 because the systemic recovery is going to impact

44:06.500 --> 44:07.680
 all those muscles anyway.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.280
 But let's say you're systemically recovering,

44:10.280 --> 44:14.320
 every muscle itself is going to have a recovery rate.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.560
 And I think what's fascinating is that

44:16.560 --> 44:19.360
 when you talked about before we like to train this week,

44:19.360 --> 44:22.220
 or we have like the way our mind looks at training.

44:22.220 --> 44:24.680
 Well, if that was the case with the biceps,

44:24.680 --> 44:28.600
 that bicep is a slave to the rest of your training split.

44:28.600 --> 44:29.440
 You know, where it's like,

44:29.440 --> 44:31.360
 well, why does it have to be also

44:31.360 --> 44:34.460
 at the end of every eighth day or, you know, or whatever,

44:34.460 --> 44:36.220
 when it might respond better

44:36.220 --> 44:37.760
 to something much more frequently?

44:37.760 --> 44:41.000
 And your legs are also being thrown into that mix.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.520
 There's a Mike Mentzer concept where he's like,

44:42.520 --> 44:43.720
 you know, train it, you know,

44:43.720 --> 44:46.000
 one set and be done for 14 days.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.120
 I mean, you know, there's such variability

44:50.120 --> 44:50.960
 between muscle groups

44:50.960 --> 44:54.160
 and you're linking them all together.

44:54.160 --> 44:59.160
 I think that coming back and using muscle soreness

44:59.240 --> 45:03.600
 as a guideline for that is one of the only tools we have

45:03.600 --> 45:05.260
 in terms of the local level.

45:05.260 --> 45:06.920
 You know, we don't really have, you know,

45:06.920 --> 45:08.680
 being able to measure, let's say,

45:08.680 --> 45:11.200
 CPK levels inside of a muscle would be amazing,

45:11.200 --> 45:16.120
 you know, at a local level to see how recovered that muscle is

45:16.120 --> 45:17.600
 but that becomes fairly invasive,

45:17.600 --> 45:20.040
 at least to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive.

45:20.040 --> 45:22.000
 So what are our tools?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.880
 I mean, I think that at the basic level,

45:23.880 --> 45:25.260
 that's the one that most people can relate to

45:25.260 --> 45:27.760
 and easily identify and then use that as a guideline.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.980
 And if you're training when you're really sore,

45:29.980 --> 45:32.260
 it's probably not a great idea.

45:32.260 --> 45:33.660
 And it's probably a good indication

45:33.660 --> 45:35.040
 that that muscle is not recovered,

45:35.040 --> 45:37.260
 but at least hearing what you and I are saying here

45:37.260 --> 45:38.600
 might be a comfort to the person to say,

45:38.600 --> 45:41.040
 yeah, it is possible that it's not recovered.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.400
 Just because 48 hours is the recommendation

45:43.400 --> 45:46.020
 and just because research points to muscle protein synthesis

45:46.020 --> 45:47.980
 needing a restimulation, well, maybe not.

45:47.980 --> 45:49.880
 Maybe you're not necessarily there yet.

45:49.880 --> 45:53.400
 You're in that, and for that muscle, you're not there yet.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.620
 So it's all really interesting stuff.

45:54.620 --> 45:59.080
 But as far as the systemic, you know, recovery,

45:59.080 --> 46:00.280
 I think there's a lot of ways, you know,

46:00.280 --> 46:01.860
 people talk about resting heart rate

46:01.860 --> 46:03.200
 measured in the morning,

46:04.040 --> 46:06.280
 all different kinds of, you know,

46:06.280 --> 46:08.140
 core temperature and things like that

46:08.140 --> 46:12.440
 that might become altered in a state of non-recovery.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.280
 But grip strength is very, very much tied

46:15.280 --> 46:18.140
 to performance and recovery.

46:18.140 --> 46:19.520
 And when I was at the Mets,

46:19.520 --> 46:22.160
 we used to actually take grip strength measurements

46:22.160 --> 46:24.280
 as a baseline in spring training all the time.

46:24.280 --> 46:25.640
 Now, obviously as a baseball player,

46:25.640 --> 46:26.960
 you're gripping a bat, you're a pitcher,

46:26.960 --> 46:28.280
 you're gripping a ball, like, you know,

46:28.280 --> 46:29.800
 having good grip strength is important.

46:29.800 --> 46:32.000
 So if we've noticed somebody had a very weak grip,

46:32.000 --> 46:33.440
 it's just a good focal point

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
 of a specialized training component for the program.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.040
 Do you do this every day with those guys?

46:37.040 --> 46:38.520
 No, in spring training,

46:38.520 --> 46:41.240
 we do sort of a baseline entry-level measurement,

46:41.240 --> 46:43.200
 and then we would measure it throughout the season,

46:43.200 --> 46:45.140
 maybe once every two weeks or three weeks.

46:45.140 --> 46:50.040
 And, you know, the idea there was to manage the recovery,

46:50.040 --> 46:51.280
 measure the recovery.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.400
 But I just gave it away.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.080
 You know, to determine overall recovery,

46:57.080 --> 46:59.080
 your grip strength is pretty highly correlated.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.980
 So we have found that with one of those scales,

47:01.980 --> 47:03.700
 those old-fashioned bathroom scales

47:03.700 --> 47:05.880
 at like Bed Bath & Beyond or whatever you can get,

47:05.880 --> 47:07.780
 which by the way, almost impossible.

47:07.780 --> 47:09.840
 I believe Jesse and I were searching for the last scale

47:09.840 --> 47:12.200
 to put in that video, and we almost couldn't find one

47:12.200 --> 47:14.320
 because everything is like digital and everything,

47:14.320 --> 47:15.160
 you know, it's like this,

47:15.160 --> 47:17.480
 I'm looking at the old-fashioned dial controls.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.120
 It's like old Macintosh computers.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.020
 There's a huge market for them.

47:21.020 --> 47:23.800
 And old phones, kids, keep your phones now.

47:23.800 --> 47:27.200
 In 30 years, the lame phone now will be worth a lot of money.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.040
 Will be worth a lot.

47:28.040 --> 47:32.200
 So, you know, I wound up, you know, finding one,

47:32.200 --> 47:37.080
 and it's a great tool for just squeezing the scale

47:37.080 --> 47:40.080
 with your hands and seeing what type of output you could get.

47:41.460 --> 47:43.560
 And I think we all can relate to this

47:43.560 --> 47:46.940
 when you just visualize, imagine the last time you were sick

47:46.940 --> 47:49.580
 or just try this the next time you wake up in the morning.

47:49.580 --> 47:51.920
 When you first wake up in the morning, you're still groggy.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.160
 Try to squeeze your hand.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.940
 Try to make a fist as hard as you can.

47:54.940 --> 47:56.800
 You're going to sit there angry at your fist

47:56.800 --> 47:59.680
 because it won't contract as hard as you know it can.

47:59.680 --> 48:03.320
 You don't have the ability to just create the output.

48:03.320 --> 48:06.520
 And that is because in that state, you're still sleepy.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.600
 You're still fatigued.

48:07.600 --> 48:12.600
 You're not even awake at the whole level at this point.

48:12.820 --> 48:17.820
 Well, that is still an actual phenomenon that happens

48:18.600 --> 48:22.280
 that a lack of recovery or a lack of wakefulness

48:22.280 --> 48:23.400
 or whatever you want to say

48:23.400 --> 48:25.440
 is going to lead to a decreased output there.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.240
 So when you start to measure that on a daily basis,

48:28.240 --> 48:29.840
 you can get a pretty good sense of where you're at.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.040
 And I think when people start to see a drop off

48:32.040 --> 48:36.400
 of 10% or so or even greater of their grip output,

48:37.240 --> 48:39.240
 you really should skip the gym that day

48:39.240 --> 48:41.400
 because I don't think there's much you're going to do there

48:41.400 --> 48:43.360
 that's going to be that beneficial,

48:43.360 --> 48:46.840
 even if it is the day to train legs or whatever day it is.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.140
 I love this tool.

48:48.140 --> 48:48.980
 It's simple.

48:48.980 --> 48:51.240
 It's low cost if you can find such a scale.

48:51.240 --> 48:53.720
 I guess you could also find one of those grippers that,

48:53.720 --> 48:56.320
 and you can do this in a very non-quantitative way,

48:56.320 --> 48:57.620
 but better would be a scale

48:57.620 --> 48:58.920
 where you could actually measure

48:58.920 --> 49:02.720
 how hard you can squeeze this thing at a given time of day.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.080
 It draws to mind just a little neuroscience factoid.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.520
 In the world of circadian neurobiology,

49:07.520 --> 49:10.080
 one of the consistent findings is that

49:10.080 --> 49:12.160
 in the middle of your nighttime,

49:12.160 --> 49:14.800
 they'll wake people up and they'll say, do this test.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.960
 In the laboratory, they use a different apparatus,

49:16.960 --> 49:18.600
 but it's essentially the same thing.

49:18.600 --> 49:19.440
 And in the middle of the night,

49:19.440 --> 49:21.040
 grip strength is very, very low.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.240
 And mid-morning, grip strength is high.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.680
 And as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon,

49:25.680 --> 49:27.120
 grip strength goes higher and higher and higher,

49:27.120 --> 49:27.960
 and then it drops off.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.920
 There's a circadian rhythm and grip temperature.

49:29.920 --> 49:30.800
 So you probably want to do this

49:30.800 --> 49:33.640
 at more or less the same time each day if you're gonna use it.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.840
 But I think it's brilliant in its simplicity

49:36.840 --> 49:39.080
 and its directness to these upper motor neurons,

49:39.080 --> 49:40.540
 because that's really what it's assessing.

49:40.540 --> 49:42.360
 Your ability, again, it's about the ability

49:42.360 --> 49:43.680
 to contract the muscles hard.

49:43.680 --> 49:44.520
 If you can't do that,

49:44.520 --> 49:45.480
 you're not gonna get an effective workout.

49:45.480 --> 49:46.800
 Yeah, and they also, I mean,

49:46.800 --> 49:50.400
 there certainly are more sophisticated tools too as a PT.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.680
 We have hand-grip dynamometers,

49:52.680 --> 49:55.840
 and we can measure one side at a time too.

49:55.840 --> 49:58.600
 I'm not really, I'm getting a little bit blinded

49:58.600 --> 50:00.800
 by the fact that both hands are squeezing into that scale

50:00.800 --> 50:03.000
 and I don't get really a left-right comparison.

50:03.000 --> 50:03.880
 But even at that level,

50:03.880 --> 50:05.200
 that could give you a little bit more detail,

50:05.200 --> 50:06.120
 but that comes with a cost.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.560
 Those are pretty expensive devices.

50:07.560 --> 50:10.100
 But if it's, listen, if you're an athlete,

50:10.100 --> 50:13.160
 the 200, 300 bucks it costs to have one of those

50:13.160 --> 50:16.000
 would be well worth the added investment.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.920
 And I'm sure some of our listeners will want one too,

50:17.920 --> 50:20.880
 because there are a lot of tech geeks out there.

50:20.880 --> 50:24.280
 Not tech industry geeks, but people who like tech gear.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.280
 What's it called again?

50:25.280 --> 50:26.800
 It's a hand-grip dynamometer.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.000
 Hand-grip dynamometer.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.240
 Said by Jeff with a great East Coast accent

50:32.240 --> 50:36.620
 and by me in a terrible botched West Coast version.

50:36.620 --> 50:37.460
 Thank you.

50:37.460 --> 50:39.500
 We'll put that in the show notes also.

50:40.440 --> 50:41.640
 I think recovery is key.

50:41.640 --> 50:42.960
 We always hear about sleep.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.440
 You grow when you sleep and incidentally your brain,

50:45.440 --> 50:48.240
 you stimulate learning when you're awake, obviously,

50:48.240 --> 50:51.200
 but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.600
 This is why sleep is the way to get smarter,

50:53.600 --> 50:55.520
 provided you're also doing the learning part.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.680
 This leaves the way to get stronger,

50:56.680 --> 50:58.500
 provided you're also doing the training part.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.760
 You've had some really,

50:59.760 --> 51:01.700
 you've put out interesting content over the years

51:01.700 --> 51:04.120
 in terms of even sleep position.

51:04.120 --> 51:08.300
 One of the major changes that I made to my sleep behavior

51:08.300 --> 51:11.640
 is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the bed.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.360
 And I'll tell you, this had a profound impact

51:13.360 --> 51:14.200
 on several things.

51:14.200 --> 51:15.480
 First of all, my feet have always been

51:15.480 --> 51:16.560
 the bane of my existence.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.920
 Broke them a bunch skateboarding.

51:18.920 --> 51:21.800
 And I noticed when I'd run, I'd get shin splints.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.720
 And then I started to notice that my feet sort of,

51:24.720 --> 51:26.480
 you're the PT, they were kind of floppy

51:26.480 --> 51:29.400
 and as if I was pointing my toes slightly all the time

51:29.400 --> 51:30.600
 at rest, if I was.

51:30.600 --> 51:34.500
 And I realized that based on listening to you previously,

51:34.500 --> 51:37.080
 that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tight.

51:37.080 --> 51:39.660
 I don't know what that thing in the hotel is.

51:39.660 --> 51:43.640
 And I started releasing the sheets at the end of the bed.

51:43.640 --> 51:46.440
 And I also started doing some tibialis work,

51:46.440 --> 51:48.620
 front shins work, essentially.

51:48.620 --> 51:49.880
 Changed everything.

51:49.880 --> 51:52.840
 My back pain from running, my shin splints disappeared,

51:52.840 --> 51:53.860
 my posture improved.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.340
 Although my audience will tell me

51:55.340 --> 51:56.360
 that it still needs improvement.

51:56.360 --> 51:57.840
 There are always five or 10 people that want.

51:57.840 --> 52:01.520
 I've actually had chairs sent to our mailing address.

52:01.520 --> 52:02.800
 Very nice chairs.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.440
 So I'm trying there.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.960
 But this is fascinating, right?

52:07.800 --> 52:09.720
 The position that one sleeps in.

52:09.720 --> 52:12.080
 I fortunately have never had any shoulder issues,

52:12.080 --> 52:13.000
 knock on wood.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.320
 But maybe you could just talk to us a little bit

52:15.320 --> 52:17.840
 about sleep and sleep position

52:17.840 --> 52:20.160
 for sake of waking position and movement.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.120
 Because this, I think, is a very unique

52:22.120 --> 52:25.060
 and very powerful way to think about sleep.

52:25.060 --> 52:27.100
 This podcast has done a lot of episodes

52:27.100 --> 52:28.660
 about keeping the room cool,

52:28.660 --> 52:29.920
 getting sunlight in your eyes, et cetera,

52:29.920 --> 52:31.580
 how to get into sleep.

52:31.580 --> 52:34.440
 But you've talked about physically

52:34.440 --> 52:36.520
 what positions might be better to sleep in.

52:36.520 --> 52:39.160
 So please enrich us.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.000
 Yeah, I mean, first of all,

52:41.000 --> 52:44.600
 some people's opinions of that type of content is that

52:45.600 --> 52:47.520
 sleep in the position that's most comfortable

52:47.520 --> 52:49.640
 so you ensure that you're sleeping.

52:49.640 --> 52:51.120
 Great, I understand that.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.040
 We all want to sleep.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.440
 That's the goal when we put our head on the pillow

52:53.440 --> 52:55.120
 is to actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning

52:55.120 --> 52:56.880
 and not know what the hell happened unless you had a dream.

52:56.880 --> 53:00.800
 But beyond that, there are certainly

53:00.800 --> 53:02.640
 physical components to sleep that.

53:02.640 --> 53:05.880
 That is why a lot of times people will wake up and say like,

53:05.880 --> 53:08.680
 that you can incur pretty serious injuries in sleep.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.600
 People will wake up and have like a shoulder

53:10.600 --> 53:12.260
 that did not bother them at all,

53:12.260 --> 53:15.720
 be humming the next day or even for weeks after

53:15.720 --> 53:17.960
 because of the one sleep position they put themselves in

53:17.960 --> 53:19.520
 in a prolonged way.

53:19.520 --> 53:20.760
 And they happen to have a deep sleep

53:20.760 --> 53:22.400
 even through the discomfort.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.780
 That can do actually some damage.

53:25.780 --> 53:28.680
 So it's understandable that the body can incur

53:28.680 --> 53:31.680
 some strain and stress if you're sleeping in the wrong way.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.880
 One of the things I say right off the bat is

53:33.880 --> 53:34.920
 sleeping on your stomach

53:34.920 --> 53:36.520
 doesn't really have many benefits.

53:36.520 --> 53:40.780
 You're putting yourself into a position that is,

53:40.780 --> 53:45.120
 depending upon the orientation of your mattress

53:45.120 --> 53:46.440
 or how many pillows you're using,

53:46.440 --> 53:47.880
 but you're basically putting yourselves

53:47.880 --> 53:51.680
 into excessive extension of the lumbar spine,

53:51.680 --> 53:53.720
 which for most people isn't very good.

53:53.720 --> 53:56.000
 If you're a disc patient,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.320
 I guess that might be helpful for relocating the disc.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.280
 But I mean, for the most part,

54:01.280 --> 54:03.520
 your hands are then usually not at your sides,

54:03.520 --> 54:04.880
 but they're up under your arms.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.920
 So you've got them into sort of internal rotation

54:06.920 --> 54:08.480
 up over elevation in your head.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.160
 It's just not a great position.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.160
 You also have to crank your neck for one side or the other

54:12.160 --> 54:13.080
 in order to breathe,

54:13.080 --> 54:15.480
 or you're going to be face down straight into the pillow.

54:15.480 --> 54:17.720
 So I would skip that one.

54:17.720 --> 54:20.480
 And there's some people that are total belly sleepers.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.000
 And I would just say, listen,

54:22.000 --> 54:25.040
 I don't think that is the most healthful,

54:25.040 --> 54:26.520
 long-term way for you to sleep.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.960
 Try to adopt a different position.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.800
 Sleeping on your side oftentimes

54:31.800 --> 54:34.320
 is also brought along with that.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.900
 The legs, knees coming up towards the chest,

54:36.900 --> 54:38.040
 prolonged hip flexion.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.040
 Listen, we're doing enough of that during the day.

54:40.040 --> 54:40.880
 We don't need to do it.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.800
 We don't need to do it like 10 hours or eight hours

54:43.800 --> 54:45.520
 or something at night like that.

54:45.520 --> 54:48.000
 And it just is reinforcing.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.520
 And as we said too, let's say you trained that day.

54:51.520 --> 54:54.560
 You're just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight.

54:54.560 --> 54:56.020
 Where the body is healing

54:56.020 --> 55:00.640
 and trying to create some changes in your body.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.440
 One of the reasons why I recommend stretching

55:02.440 --> 55:04.520
 or static stretching prior to going to bed.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.360
 A lot of people don't really want to do it at that point

55:06.360 --> 55:08.640
 because it could take 10 minutes, five, 10 minutes,

55:08.640 --> 55:10.240
 depending upon how many muscles you have to stretch.

55:10.240 --> 55:13.220
 But it's good to try to establish

55:13.220 --> 55:15.240
 just longer length temporarily

55:15.240 --> 55:16.520
 prior to going into a state

55:16.520 --> 55:19.420
 where you're going to be non-moving and recovering

55:19.420 --> 55:22.520
 and creating new changes in the muscles.

55:22.520 --> 55:27.520
 So that kind of, I don't say it doesn't rule out

55:27.560 --> 55:28.640
 the side sleeper.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.360
 The side sleeper could be very, very helpful

55:30.360 --> 55:34.000
 for somebody that has apnea or other conditions.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.720
 So again, it's not an all or nothing approach,

55:36.720 --> 55:40.740
 but it just is something that you need to pay attention to.

55:40.740 --> 55:43.160
 When you are on your back, like you were talking about

55:43.160 --> 55:47.460
 and your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets

55:47.460 --> 55:48.300
 at the end of the bed.

55:48.300 --> 55:51.640
 And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up,

55:51.640 --> 55:53.660
 don't prefer our beds to have really loose sheets

55:53.660 --> 55:54.500
 at the end of the bed.

55:54.500 --> 55:55.680
 It's hard to make the bed in the morning.

55:55.680 --> 55:59.360
 Right, so it's like, you're going to want to have them tight.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.740
 Well, I'm saying, as you experienced,

56:01.740 --> 56:06.740
 you're going to have this prolonged plantar flexion

56:07.160 --> 56:12.160
 that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time

56:12.840 --> 56:14.840
 because you're lacking all that length

56:14.840 --> 56:17.000
 for that long period of time that you could have

56:17.000 --> 56:18.720
 if you just loosened up the sheets

56:18.720 --> 56:21.160
 and allowed your feet to just hang out where they are.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.280
 Now, the resting position of the ankle

56:23.280 --> 56:24.320
 is not in dorsiflexion.

56:24.320 --> 56:26.040
 It's going to be still in some plantar flexion,

56:26.040 --> 56:28.200
 but not being driven down and pulled down

56:28.200 --> 56:30.000
 into that position.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.120
 And I think what happens actually

56:31.120 --> 56:33.680
 is people who get uncomfortable that way,

56:33.680 --> 56:36.080
 even in their sleep, will shift away from that

56:36.080 --> 56:37.880
 by turning either onto their side of their stomach.

56:37.880 --> 56:41.160
 So there's definitely an impact of the body position

56:41.160 --> 56:43.620
 in sleep and figuring out the best way

56:43.620 --> 56:46.620
 that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest,

56:46.620 --> 56:49.360
 but have a mindful eye towards what it's doing to your body

56:49.360 --> 56:53.460
 and choose the one that's least abrasive to your body

56:53.460 --> 56:55.120
 is the way you should go.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.120
 Terrific, and again, it's really helped me.

56:57.120 --> 57:01.800
 And I am a big believer, based on good science

57:01.800 --> 57:03.960
 out of Stanford and elsewhere,

57:03.960 --> 57:06.800
 that as much as we can be nasal breathers in sleep,

57:06.800 --> 57:07.620
 we probably should be.

57:07.620 --> 57:09.840
 I don't know if you've done any content yet

57:09.840 --> 57:12.360
 about taping the mouth shut with some medical tape,

57:12.360 --> 57:15.300
 but the benefits of nasal breathing and sleep

57:15.300 --> 57:16.140
 are pretty tremendous,

57:16.140 --> 57:18.060
 but it takes a little bit of training for people to do.

57:18.060 --> 57:19.280
 And the training is very simple.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.040
 It's a little piece of medical tape.

57:21.040 --> 57:24.120
 So again, a topic for another time.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.320
 I'm glad you mentioned stretching.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.900
 I was going to ask about stretching a little bit later,

57:26.900 --> 57:29.200
 but let's talk about stretching.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.680
 When's the best time to stretch

57:30.680 --> 57:33.320
 for particular types of results?

57:33.320 --> 57:34.200
 And maybe you could define

57:34.200 --> 57:36.080
 some of the different types of stretching.

57:36.080 --> 57:38.840
 So you just mentioned a little bit of,

57:38.840 --> 57:41.080
 would you call it light stretching or,

57:41.080 --> 57:43.800
 okay, I'm completely naive here on stretching.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.300
 So let me just say, I can think of stretching

57:45.300 --> 57:49.560
 where I hold the stretch and really try and lengthen,

57:49.560 --> 57:50.600
 in air quotes, folks.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.300
 I don't want the PTs jumping all over.

57:52.300 --> 57:53.140
 I don't know what it is,

57:53.140 --> 57:55.480
 but nutrition and the PTs online are really,

57:55.480 --> 57:58.280
 they've got pitchforks in both hands, academics.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.840
 That's a recent evolution, I think, for sure.

58:00.840 --> 58:01.820
 And not the nutrition as much,

58:01.820 --> 58:04.000
 but the PTs have become a little bit angry these days.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
 I see, well, I always say

58:05.000 --> 58:08.360
 with feelings of powerlessness comes aggression.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.520
 Remember that, folks.

58:09.520 --> 58:14.520
 So in any case, they're stretching where I'm,

58:14.520 --> 58:18.320
 you know, trying to consciously lengthen,

58:18.320 --> 58:20.160
 again, in air quotes, the muscle.

58:20.160 --> 58:23.320
 I'm not yanking on the limb or bobbing up and down.

58:23.320 --> 58:24.500
 Maybe you could define the different types

58:24.500 --> 58:25.340
 of stretching for people.

58:25.340 --> 58:27.320
 Maybe give us some rough guidelines

58:27.320 --> 58:28.920
 about whether or not to do it cold or warm,

58:28.920 --> 58:31.060
 before training, after training, et cetera.

58:31.060 --> 58:32.840
 So yeah, there's obviously,

58:32.840 --> 58:34.400
 there's a lot of different types of stretching.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.880
 They could get even to, you know,

58:35.880 --> 58:39.240
 PNF stretching and things that are a little bit more,

58:39.240 --> 58:41.340
 you know, niche, but like in general,

58:41.340 --> 58:42.840
 the two basic forms of stretching

58:42.840 --> 58:44.860
 are active stretching and passive stretching.

58:44.860 --> 58:48.400
 And your, you know, your dynamic work

58:48.400 --> 58:51.000
 and your passive stretching is done

58:51.000 --> 58:54.540
 with the goal of trying to create an increase

58:54.540 --> 58:57.240
 in the flexibility of the muscle.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.840
 So whether you're actually increasing

58:58.840 --> 59:00.200
 the length of that muscle, you know,

59:00.200 --> 59:02.760
 more so what you're doing is increasing the resistance

59:02.760 --> 59:04.480
 or decreasing the resistance of that muscle

59:04.480 --> 59:07.880
 to want to stay at a certain level of flexibility.

59:07.880 --> 59:10.560
 So when we can sort of take the brakes off

59:10.560 --> 59:14.320
 and allow that muscle to allow us more range of motion,

59:14.320 --> 59:16.200
 we're inherently increasing flexibility

59:16.200 --> 59:17.640
 without necessarily having to increase

59:17.640 --> 59:18.980
 the length of that muscle.

59:20.380 --> 59:23.860
 That is usually done at a time far away from your workout

59:23.860 --> 59:26.740
 because they have shown where this type of stretching

59:26.740 --> 59:28.680
 done prior to an activity.

59:28.680 --> 59:31.680
 And it could be like a structured activity,

59:31.680 --> 59:35.720
 like lifting, or it could be a little bit less structured,

59:35.720 --> 59:39.360
 like competing in a sport in a spontaneous type way.

59:39.360 --> 59:43.280
 That there is a period of recalibration

59:43.280 --> 59:45.640
 that is needed after doing this,

59:45.640 --> 59:47.880
 because you're disrupting the length tension relationship

59:47.880 --> 59:51.760
 of the muscle that causes you to not necessarily

59:51.760 --> 59:54.580
 be able to rely on these, I've talked about before,

59:54.580 --> 59:57.220
 stored motor engrams in your mind in terms of,

59:57.220 --> 59:59.880
 this is the pattern for how I swing a golf club, say.

59:59.880 --> 1:00:03.860
 You know, and now introducing a little bit of flexibility

1:00:03.860 --> 1:00:05.380
 or added flexibility or range

1:00:05.380 --> 1:00:07.400
 because of the stretching I did before,

1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:12.060
 it takes maybe a whole or two or three to match up again.

1:00:12.060 --> 1:00:13.800
 Oh, this is what he's trying to do,

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:15.840
 that golf swing thing that I remembered again.

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:18.300
 Like it's not remembering that every component,

1:00:18.300 --> 1:00:21.200
 like I have to bend my right wrist back 10 degrees

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:23.360
 and then I have to bend my elbow and I have to break,

1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:26.260
 like your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency.

1:00:26.260 --> 1:00:29.560
 So, and when I have to start matching up that stored pattern

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:32.680
 with what's feeling new because of the increased range,

1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:33.880
 I can impair performance.

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:36.240
 And again, it could happen even in a gym workout

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:37.800
 where you're talking about your first, second set,

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:41.280
 third set, where maybe the repercussions aren't as big

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:43.160
 because I'll just do a few extra sets.

1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:45.280
 But in performance, if you screw up your first three rounds,

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:46.720
 you're playing on a PGA tour and you shoot,

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.800
 you know, you're six over after three, you're done, you know?

1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:51.840
 So I think it matters there.

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:55.660
 As far as the dynamic, you know, so we relegate that,

1:00:55.660 --> 1:00:57.080
 as I mentioned, sort of towards the end of the day,

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:59.280
 when it's not going to impact performance,

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:01.840
 but even maybe have the additional benefit

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:06.240
 of creating the feeling of length or the increase

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:09.000
 or decrease in resistance to this length

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.920
 at a time when I know my body is going to try to tend

1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:14.900
 to heal and heal shorter, never longer, but heal shorter.

1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:17.840
 So if I can introduce a little bit of that extra length

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:20.080
 or decreased resistance to that length,

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:21.200
 it's a better time to do it.

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:25.160
 So I think it promotes a better recovery.

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:26.240
 If I want to-

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.080
 Sorry to interrupt.

1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:29.200
 So stretching later in the day,

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:33.040
 because I'm intrigued by this concept of heal shorter.

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:34.800
 So part of the healing and recovery process

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:35.960
 means a shortening of the muscles.

1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:37.920
 This is the tensing up in sleep.

1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:39.360
 Could you elaborate just a bit on that

1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:41.400
 and then sorry to break your flow, but then to continue?

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:43.360
 No, just basically, you know, what's been shown

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:46.720
 is that when the repair process,

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:49.360
 muscular repair from let's say strength training

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:50.200
 during the day,

1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:52.440
 the repair process usually results in a muscle

1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:55.840
 that is slightly shorter rather than increased in length.

1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:57.560
 You know, it's just that it's, you know,

1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:00.920
 muscles prefer to sort of ratchet their way down

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:05.360
 into that contraction and then maintain

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:08.360
 that more comfortable length tension relationship.

1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:11.920
 So when you're sleeping, it tends to err on the side

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:13.080
 of shorter rather than longer,

1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:15.040
 when ideally we don't really want that.

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:17.960
 We want to maintain as much of that length

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:21.120
 because with more length, we actually have more leverage,

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:23.240
 right, that muscle has more leverage to contract.

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.960
 If it was all the way contracted, you know,

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:26.040
 you really can't obviously, you know,

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:27.360
 generate much force in a muscle

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.600
 that's already maximally contracted.

1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:33.080
 So I think we want to do something that we,

1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:35.160
 whatever we can, whatever little weapons we have

1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:37.640
 in our arsenal that could allow us to do this

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:39.520
 prior to sleep.

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:42.360
 And again, it's just making a conscious choice

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:43.360
 to do it at a time of the day

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:45.000
 that makes a little bit more sense.

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.760
 Dynamic stretching is really not done for that purpose

1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:53.760
 of trying to create any type of feeling of act

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.360
 or increasing the potential length,

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:57.440
 as you said, of the muscle,

1:02:57.440 --> 1:03:00.040
 but more so the readiness of the muscle to perform

1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:03.480
 and increasing, you know, exploring the ends

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:05.840
 of that range of motion in a more dynamic way

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:07.560
 so you're not hanging out there

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.560
 and disrupting that length tension relationship

1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:12.800
 but just sort of touching the ends of those barriers

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:15.320
 so that when you feel movement again,

1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:17.400
 it feels looser, it feels more ready.

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:20.840
 And obviously at the same time, warming up, blood flow,

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:23.560
 all the benefits we get from just warming up in general.

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.600
 So like, you know, that's the series

1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:26.680
 you've probably seen a bunch of times,

1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:30.080
 but like, you know, leg swings and, you know,

1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:33.040
 butt kicks and, you know, lunge, walking lunges

1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:34.320
 and all types of drills.

1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:35.160
 Toe touches.

1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:36.800
 Toe touches, all those kinds of drills,

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.760
 those active stretching drills or, you know,

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:40.960
 lunging with rotations of the upper body

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:43.160
 to try to get some of the thoracic spine involved too.

1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:44.720
 Those are the drills that people will do

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:47.640
 prior to training that are both excitatory

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.360
 in terms of just the nervous system,

1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:52.560
 but also helpful for just the general warmup of the body

1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:53.600
 because of the blood flow,

1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:55.400
 but from a muscle readiness standpoint,

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:59.320
 not impairing the performance while at the same time

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.400
 exploring the increased ranges.

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:04.120
 Because as you know, the first toe touch you do

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:05.800
 is not as high as the last toe touch you do.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.480
 For me, it doesn't even include the toe.

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:09.200
 Right, the shin touch, knee touch.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:10.120
 Toe touch attempt.

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:11.400
 Right, right, so like, you know,

1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:14.440
 those are going to improve with each subsequent rep

1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:15.920
 and I think that's what people actually,

1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:19.360
 like when you can see those actual changes

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:22.520
 from rep one to rep seven, you just feel ready.

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:25.200
 You feel more alert and ready to go in your workout.

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:27.840
 So the dynamic type of stretching,

1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:29.360
 and I mentioned earlier on, you know,

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:31.680
 like what I've had to do to sort of increase

1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:33.240
 my warmup focus, you know,

1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:36.040
 I think that's more of what I try to do these days.

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:39.120
 I try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that,

1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:40.240
 you know, my body's not ready.

1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:42.040
 When I was working with Antonio Brown,

1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:44.880
 I remember like he would spend 20 minutes,

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:47.280
 30 minutes on all dynamic work.

1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:49.600
 And I've never seen anybody spend that long

1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:50.640
 on their dynamic work,

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:55.120
 but like he said, he just didn't feel right and ready to go

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:56.960
 unless he did a lot of that.

1:04:56.960 --> 1:05:00.160
 And I mean, you know, his dynamic stretching routine

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:02.240
 would be a workout for most everybody.

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:04.560
 You know, it's crazy how much he did.

1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:06.160
 These pro athletes are amazing

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:08.920
 and you've had the great fortune of working with

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:11.200
 and improving their abilities.

1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:13.920
 But I can only imagine,

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.680
 cause I also imagine he's pretty strong in the gym also.

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:19.080
 I mean, you know, it always amazes me

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:20.480
 the guys that make it to that level,

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:22.480
 no matter what sport they do,

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:24.360
 they're so gifted in everything, you know,

1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:27.280
 like David Wright used to make me laugh all the time

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:31.680
 with the Mets because no matter what I ping pong,

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:33.000
 you know, like anything,

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.480
 because of his hand-eye coordination,

1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:37.120
 like anything, you know, great at.

1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:39.800
 Jump rope, I remember he hadn't done a lot of jump rope

1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:43.200
 and I think jump rope is one of the best things

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:44.920
 you could do from a conditioning standpoint.

1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:46.440
 It's actually, it's fairly interesting.

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:48.240
 It's not just, you know,

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:50.600
 it's not too harsh on the joints,

1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:52.760
 depending on, you know, even though it's a ballistic move.

1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:55.400
 And he wasn't, I have to admit, you know,

1:05:55.400 --> 1:05:56.800
 if you listen to this, he's going to want to kill me,

1:05:56.800 --> 1:05:59.400
 but I was better at him than at jump roping.

1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:00.800
 One of the only things I could do.

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:02.880
 And then I gave him about five days

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:04.640
 and he completely blew me out of the water

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:06.840
 to the point where I could never keep up with him anymore.

1:06:06.840 --> 1:06:08.240
 He made it look effortless.

1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:11.120
 It's like, that's where the athlete in someone comes out.

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:13.320
 No matter what they pick up, they're good at it.

1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:15.560
 And I think that when you see guys like this in the gym,

1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:17.680
 like their strength levels tend to be pretty damn good

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.520
 and they're in their abilities, their coordination,

1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:21.960
 their everything just tends to sort of be good

1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:24.320
 at that level, you know, and it sort of amazes me

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.640
 why those guys can go pick up a golf club, you know,

1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:28.920
 and go shoot 72, you know,

1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:31.000
 and having never really played, you know,

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.920
 they're just naturally good at whatever they do.

1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:34.760
 Yeah, I have a couple,

1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:37.480
 I'm smiling because I have a couple of really close friends

1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:38.800
 who did a number of years,

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:40.760
 some several decades in the SEAL teams.

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:43.280
 And I don't know that their skill level at everything

1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:45.520
 is so high as you're describing for athletes,

1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:48.480
 but their level of competitiveness is beyond.

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:49.560
 I ocean swim with one.

1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:51.400
 There's no chance that I'm going to, you know,

1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:53.440
 out swim Pat ever, ever.

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:54.960
 He actually goes back and forth sometimes

1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:57.480
 just to check up on me, which I appreciate.

1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:58.920
 Thank you, Pat.

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:01.960
 I haven't drowned yet, but the, but in addition to that,

1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:03.520
 you know, we could play horseshoes

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:05.640
 and it's like this switch that just flips on.

1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:07.360
 Like he's going to murder me, horseshoes,

1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:08.600
 and a very nice guy, right?

1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:09.800
 In general, they tend to be very nice,

1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:12.480
 but the level of competitiveness is kind of unreal.

1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:13.400
 They're selected for it.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:14.400
 They're trying to beat themselves.

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:15.320
 They're not even trying to beat you.

1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:16.160
 That's right.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:16.980
 I'm not even in the competition.

1:07:16.980 --> 1:07:17.820
 You're not even in the competition.

1:07:17.820 --> 1:07:18.640
 You're not even there.

1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:19.480
 Yeah, exactly.

1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:20.600
 Thank you.

1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:22.920
 Now I won't feel so bad or worse.

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:24.840
 It's true.

1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:25.660
 It's, it's a remarkable thing.

1:07:25.660 --> 1:07:26.720
 I'm glad you mentioned jump roping.

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:30.040
 I used to skip rope for warmup for boxing, you know,

1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:33.840
 like three, three minute rounds or something like that.

1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:36.960
 But I'm glad you brought it up because skipping rope

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:40.600
 is something that obviously has a cardiovascular component.

1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:42.280
 There's the conditioning component, there's timing,

1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:43.840
 and it is kind of interesting, right?

1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:45.880
 You can, it's frustrating when you don't get it,

1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:47.120
 especially when it whips you on the ear,

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:48.480
 if you're using a proper rope.

1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:50.800
 I'm just curious if you could just give us a quick

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:51.840
 skipping rope one-on-one.

1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:54.800
 Do you like to see people jumping with both feet and toes?

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:57.640
 We'll link to a video if there was one and I missed it.

1:07:57.640 --> 1:07:59.120
 Do you like to see people doing high knees?

1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:01.920
 Do you like people basically like shuffling?

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:03.200
 You want to see people doing double dutch?

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:05.480
 What do you want to see people doing over time?

1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:07.200
 All of the above, maybe not the double dutch,

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:08.320
 but all of the above.

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.560
 I mean, I think that that's the cool thing about it, right?

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:12.240
 Like once we sort of master the skill,

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:13.320
 cause for all of us,

1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:16.320
 that first jump with the two feet going together

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:17.160
 is a challenge.

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:18.460
 Cause you just got to time that rope,

1:08:18.460 --> 1:08:19.640
 you got to time your jump.

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:22.280
 And then we get bored as we often do as humans,

1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:23.520
 we get bored with what we can do

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:24.920
 and want to take on new challenges.

1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:26.580
 So then it becomes one leg at a time,

1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:29.480
 or then it becomes side to side hops, right?

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.920
 All of those things are beneficial,

1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:34.640
 I believe neurologically to enhancing the ability

1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:35.920
 to do the skill as a whole,

1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.000
 but also just because I'm such a believer in training

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:40.960
 in all three planes.

1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:43.580
 So like just doing straight up and down

1:08:43.580 --> 1:08:46.560
 versus now I can do frontal plane side to side motion.

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:48.760
 And then I can even do small little twists

1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:50.700
 or corkscrews we call them.

1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:51.760
 It requires a different,

1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:53.440
 you would know more about it better than I do.

1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:56.600
 It requires different neurological patterns

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:58.040
 to be able to coordinate that

1:08:58.040 --> 1:08:59.840
 because you're changing the orientation

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:00.720
 of your body and space.

1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:03.120
 So it's not just that I'm changing the exercise,

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:06.000
 but I'm changing how my body interprets that exercise

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.960
 because what's happening to my body and space.

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:12.340
 So I love, you know, whatever people wind up doing,

1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:14.440
 but I am amazed.

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:15.580
 There are people,

1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:17.800
 I just started following this young woman on Instagram

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.920
 who is like, I'll give her a plug.

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:22.340
 I think it's like Anna Skips or something.

1:09:22.340 --> 1:09:24.920
 And she is ridiculous.

1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:26.960
 Like I watch her and I'm like mesmerized

1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:28.320
 at what she can do with the rope.

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:31.920
 You know, it's like, is an extremely athletic endeavor

1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:33.240
 when it gets to be at that level

1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:35.880
 in the speed and the precision in the, you know,

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:38.140
 and you know, I think one of the goals

1:09:38.140 --> 1:09:40.440
 that you want to be able to have is

1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:43.080
 to where you're feeling as if you're almost

1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:45.220
 effortlessly dancing without a rope,

1:09:45.220 --> 1:09:46.720
 like where you're just bouncing off

1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:47.960
 of the ball of your foot.

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.960
 And it's an important skill to learn too,

1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:53.960
 whether you go back to run or, you know,

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:55.440
 or even jog, right?

1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:57.680
 Just like, you know, more casual running.

1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.280
 Learning how to land is so important.

1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:02.640
 One of the drills that people should try

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:05.220
 is like try to jump on your heels.

1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:07.920
 So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, right?

1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:10.540
 And just jump from your heels and land on your heels.

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:12.120
 You'll feel it in your jaw.

1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:13.720
 You'll literally feel your jaw rattle

1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:14.840
 when you land on your heels.

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.940
 There is no shock absorption capabilities

1:10:16.940 --> 1:10:17.880
 through your heels.

1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:21.380
 Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot

1:10:21.380 --> 1:10:22.640
 when they run.

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:24.400
 And you're just, your body's not built

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:26.960
 to absorb the forces like the ball of your foot could.

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:28.960
 It's really built as a spring.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:31.960
 And the foot is, to me, as a physical therapist,

1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:33.720
 the foot has always been one of the most amazing,

1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:35.080
 you know, you talk about having bad feet.

1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:36.360
 I have flat feet.

1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:39.000
 It looks like I got flippers if I took my shoes off,

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.440
 like when I'm wearing scuba fins.

1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:46.440
 There is no adaptability of that foot to the surface.

1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:48.860
 You know, when it's completely caved

1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:50.220
 and flattened like that,

1:10:50.220 --> 1:10:53.400
 the job of the foot is to be adaptable.

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:55.260
 Well, there is, maybe there is some adaptability

1:10:55.260 --> 1:10:56.660
 because it's so floppy.

1:10:56.660 --> 1:10:58.140
 But at the same time, at some point,

1:10:58.140 --> 1:10:59.060
 that critical juncture,

1:10:59.060 --> 1:11:00.680
 when you're going to then step through

1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:02.540
 and you need to be able to push off,

1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:05.700
 the foot has to actually change this in the mid-foot itself

1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:08.380
 to become a rigid lever, as they call it.

1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:11.620
 You're going from a mobile adapter to a rigid lever.

1:11:11.620 --> 1:11:14.800
 That rigid lever literally locks up the mid-tarsal joint

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:18.100
 to become solid so that you can push off of it

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:19.000
 with leverage.

1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.020
 If you lack that capability,

1:11:21.020 --> 1:11:23.220
 all those stresses that are supposed to be borne

1:11:23.220 --> 1:11:25.180
 by the foot go up into the ankle, into the knee,

1:11:25.180 --> 1:11:27.060
 into the hip, into the low back.

1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:31.940
 So learning how to land and start to train your body

1:11:31.940 --> 1:11:36.940
 to experience ground reaction forces the right way

1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:40.380
 is so critical to all other function

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:43.180
 and all other disability up the kinetic chain.

1:11:43.180 --> 1:11:45.380
 And jumping rope is like one of the best ways

1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:46.420
 to learn how to do that.

1:11:46.420 --> 1:11:48.580
 Great, I own a jump rope.

1:11:48.580 --> 1:11:50.420
 I love doing it in the morning

1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:51.860
 while I get sunlight in my eyes.

1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:55.700
 It's actually a protocol I picked up from Tim Ferriss

1:11:55.700 --> 1:11:58.260
 who mentioned, because listeners of my podcast

1:11:58.260 --> 1:12:00.340
 know I'm like a broken record with get sunlight

1:12:00.340 --> 1:12:02.180
 in your eyes, even through cloud cover.

1:12:02.180 --> 1:12:04.900
 It just sets your sleep rhythms and your waking rhythms,

1:12:04.900 --> 1:12:06.440
 the yada yada, on and on.

1:12:07.380 --> 1:12:09.300
 But sometimes they'd be kind of boring for people

1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:10.480
 and I want to get them off their phone.

1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:12.740
 So jumping rope is also just a great way to wake up.

1:12:12.740 --> 1:12:17.540
 So jumping rope can be the cardio workout,

1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:19.300
 the 15 or 30 minutes.

1:12:19.300 --> 1:12:20.140
 Definitely.

1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:21.180
 And there's sort of that hybrid

1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:23.180
 that we were talking about before of like,

1:12:23.180 --> 1:12:25.660
 no, you're not necessarily dropping down to the ground

1:12:25.660 --> 1:12:27.220
 and doing burpees, but I just look at it

1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:29.060
 as a more athletic endeavor

1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:30.900
 because of the coordination involved

1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:33.140
 than just simply walking or jogging.

1:12:33.140 --> 1:12:36.740
 Yeah, and it's not much of a equipment requirement,

1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:38.060
 very minimal cost.

1:12:38.060 --> 1:12:40.940
 You could even use a rope or something if you...

1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:43.740
 Although we even instruct people that you use no rope

1:12:43.740 --> 1:12:46.500
 and just pretend, and just move the arms, right?

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.140
 You're never going to hit the rope, which is good,

1:12:49.140 --> 1:12:50.100
 but at the same time,

1:12:50.100 --> 1:12:51.640
 so you're never going to know if you're doing it wrong,

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.580
 but at least you can move through that

1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:55.300
 and get the same benefits through the feet.

1:12:55.300 --> 1:12:56.140
 I love it.

1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:57.400
 I love it.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:00.000
 I told myself before sitting down with you today

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.580
 that I wasn't going to focus on specific exercises

1:13:02.580 --> 1:13:05.380
 because there's such a wealth of incredible content

1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:06.980
 that you put out there that people could just put

1:13:06.980 --> 1:13:10.360
 into YouTube or elsewhere and arrive at the proper way

1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:13.420
 to do a chin or a dip or for whatever purpose,

1:13:13.420 --> 1:13:16.900
 but there's one exercise in one particular motion

1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:19.380
 that I'd like to discuss for a moment

1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:23.820
 because I believe that learning about this cautionary note

1:13:23.820 --> 1:13:26.820
 from you is one of the reasons

1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:29.980
 that I've maintained steady training for 30 years

1:13:29.980 --> 1:13:33.060
 with no major injury, knock on wood,

1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:34.640
 and that's the upright row.

1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:39.060
 One thing that, whether or not people weight train or not-

1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:40.580
 Do we censor this podcast?

1:13:40.580 --> 1:13:42.100
 Are we censoring to be beeped this out or no?

1:13:42.100 --> 1:13:44.420
 Oh, do you get beef about this?

1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:47.420
 You know what?

1:13:47.420 --> 1:13:50.180
 We always get beef in any social media platform

1:13:50.180 --> 1:13:52.900
 we ever put out, but like, no, I get some from it,

1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:55.780
 but I'm fully prepared to defend myself.

1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:58.460
 But here's the reason for asking about this.

1:13:58.460 --> 1:14:00.820
 I never really cared much for upright rows.

1:14:00.820 --> 1:14:02.340
 It's not an exercise I tend to do,

1:14:02.340 --> 1:14:05.360
 but one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:07.660
 and every child I see and every adult I see

1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:11.620
 is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now.

1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:14.220
 So folks, I think I learned this from you also,

1:14:14.220 --> 1:14:15.140
 if you stand up straight

1:14:15.140 --> 1:14:17.140
 and then you just point your thumbs out,

1:14:17.140 --> 1:14:19.580
 like a thumbs up, but your hands are down,

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:21.340
 you're pointing your thumbs straight out,

1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:23.120
 ideally they would go straight out.

1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:24.500
 Most people, the thumbs are gonna be pointing

1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:25.340
 toward one another

1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:26.920
 because most people are starting to look somewhere

1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:31.920
 between a non-human primate and a melted candle.

1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:34.760
 You know, bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting.

1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:36.960
 We're all sitting, we're in inward rotation,

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:39.560
 but I learned from you that the upright row

1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:42.160
 compromises some important aspects

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:44.200
 of our shoulder mechanics

1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:46.400
 and can be actually sort of a dangerous movement

1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:47.240
 in some ways.

1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:49.040
 I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it,

1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:51.840
 but so I've always made it a point now

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:55.840
 on the basis of this advice to A, not do upright rows,

1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:56.800
 but I wasn't doing them before,

1:14:56.800 --> 1:14:59.320
 but to really strive for upright rows

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.720
 but I wasn't doing them before, but to really strive for

1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:05.720
 external rotation on things like bench dips

1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:07.320
 on a number of different things.

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:09.800
 Whenever I can, I try and go into external rotation

1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:11.640
 and provide, you know, without looking like an idiot

1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:13.740
 walking around with my palms facing outward.

1:15:13.740 --> 1:15:16.240
 Please tell us about internal external rotation.

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:20.060
 The upright row is one aspect of that,

1:15:20.060 --> 1:15:23.720
 but why this is so important, not just for weight training,

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:26.380
 but as in terms of posture and mechanics

1:15:26.380 --> 1:15:29.700
 and not looking like a melted candle

1:15:29.700 --> 1:15:31.680
 or partially melted candle.

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:32.520
 I actually love it.

1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.760
 I am happy to talk about it

1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:37.320
 because I love the shoulder as a joint.

1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:39.880
 I think PTs tend to fall in love with certain areas

1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:41.760
 and the shoulder is one of the cool areas for me

1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:42.740
 and it's like the foot is,

1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:46.540
 but like the shoulder has the most mobility in the body

1:15:46.540 --> 1:15:49.480
 of any joint, but it's also got the least stability, right?

1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:52.120
 There's always that trade off of mobility and stability.

1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:57.120
 So your stability comes from, you know, certain muscle groups

1:15:57.680 --> 1:15:59.920
 and one of the ones that the only muscle group

1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:02.000
 that actually externally rotates the shoulder

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.640
 is going to be the rotator cuff, okay?

1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:06.160
 And unless you were devoted to training

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:08.400
 through external rotation and exercises

1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:11.400
 that are going to externally rotate the shoulder,

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:13.640
 you're not training that function.

1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:17.020
 And it's so easy for us in everyday life,

1:16:17.020 --> 1:16:18.600
 especially those that aren't training

1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:21.440
 to not ever really undergo any of those stresses

1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:23.560
 that could be beneficial to counteracting

1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:25.800
 what happens freely and naturally,

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:27.100
 which is internal rotation.

1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:30.040
 So when you think about the imbalance created just by nature

1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:31.440
 and how we live our lives,

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:35.820
 internal rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation.

1:16:35.820 --> 1:16:37.640
 So you need to address it.

1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:39.000
 And the reason why you need to address it

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.760
 is because you need to normalize

1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:42.220
 those biomechanics to the shoulder

1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:43.760
 if you want their long-term health.

1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:45.440
 And one of the functions of the shoulder

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:47.360
 is to raise our arm up over our head.

1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:50.880
 And if we do that from an internally rotated position,

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:53.640
 we're going to have a higher likelihood

1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:55.760
 of creating stress inside that joint.

1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.320
 Funny thing is, I talked about before,

1:16:57.320 --> 1:17:01.660
 my PT brethren can be somewhat angry these days.

1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:03.920
 I don't know what happened, but fairly angry.

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:06.760
 They want to discredit the existence

1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:09.020
 of something like shoulder impingement,

1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:12.800
 which I don't know how, I mean, certain studies,

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:14.580
 look at, we all read studies

1:17:14.580 --> 1:17:16.960
 and studies will say one thing one day

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:19.720
 and potentially conflict entirely in a different direction.

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:21.520
 Some studies will point to the non-existence

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:24.040
 of a shoulder impingement.

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:28.600
 Meanwhile, we have thankfully digital motion x-rays

1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:31.480
 that will literally show the impingement occur

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:33.640
 in real time, in real function.

1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:34.680
 And that's one of the limitations,

1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:35.560
 I'm off on a tangent here,

1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:37.120
 but like those types of x-rays

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:39.320
 or that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays,

1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:41.800
 like gives us such insight that we never had before

1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:43.280
 because we're taking static x-rays

1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:44.860
 of someone laying down on a table.

1:17:44.860 --> 1:17:46.120
 You know, when I want to see what happens

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.820
 when he actually raised my arm up over my head in function

1:17:48.820 --> 1:17:51.300
 and the tools now exist to do that,

1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:53.480
 we see the problems occurring

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:56.800
 because in order to get normal mechanics

1:17:56.800 --> 1:17:59.240
 and free up the joint maximally inside,

1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:02.440
 you need to externally rotate as you raise the arm up.

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:04.520
 So if your muscles aren't firing

1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:07.800
 and they're not necessarily as strong

1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:10.800
 as the internal rotation bias that pulls them in,

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:12.700
 you're asking for trouble every time you do that.

1:18:12.700 --> 1:18:16.560
 Well, this exercise is literally putting you

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:18.440
 in elevation and internal rotation.

1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:20.600
 And if you were to walk into a PT office

1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:22.600
 and someone said, I think he's got an impingement,

1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:23.520
 will you diagnose him?

1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:25.440
 There's a test called a Hawkins Kennedy test.

1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:27.240
 And I would put you in the position,

1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:29.720
 I know we're not visible at this point through the podcast,

1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:31.640
 but I'll put you in this position here

1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:33.400
 where I have your arm elevated

1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:35.880
 and your hand pretty much under your chin

1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:37.160
 pushing downward on that

1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:38.960
 to create that internal shoulder rotation.

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:40.760
 Pretty much the exact position that we're in

1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:43.600
 when we're holding a bar in an upright row.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.420
 Some will say, well, just don't go so high,

1:18:45.420 --> 1:18:46.940
 go only up to the level of the chest,

1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:49.840
 but you're still in this internally rotated position.

1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:51.880
 The thing that I think frustrates me the most

1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:55.280
 about the exercise is that I have an alternative

1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.820
 and the alternative does the same thing

1:18:56.820 --> 1:18:58.880
 in terms of helping the muscles grow

1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:01.240
 by simply fixing the biomechanics of the exercise,

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:03.740
 but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows.

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:06.080
 So instead of the elbows being higher than the hand,

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:08.080
 which drives you into internal rotation,

1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:10.180
 if the elbow is lower than the hand,

1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:13.320
 the hand being higher here, I'm in external rotation.

1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:15.580
 And I could do something called a high pull

1:19:15.580 --> 1:19:18.280
 and still get the same abduction of the arm

1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:19.680
 and still get the same benefits

1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:21.680
 of the shoulders, the delts and the traps

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:23.680
 without having to undergo any of the stresses

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:26.340
 that would come from the somewhat awkward movement

1:19:26.340 --> 1:19:27.680
 of an upright row.

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.040
 And for those listening,

1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:31.480
 we'll put a link to a short clip of what this looks like,

1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:33.020
 but basically what Jeff is doing

1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:35.520
 and tell me if I'm describing this incorrectly or correctly.

1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:38.520
 Jeff is taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you

1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:41.380
 and elbows up kind of near the chin

1:19:41.380 --> 1:19:43.300
 and pointing behind you, like, oh, headed that way,

1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:44.720
 like somebody directing the airplane,

1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:46.800
 like come back, come back, come back.

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:47.760
 I forget what they call that.

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:49.560
 I think it's called semaphorin,

1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:52.000
 is the action of like where they direct the planes

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.560
 or something, the flags or whatever.

1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:55.840
 Someone will of course tell me I'm wrong about that too,

1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:57.340
 which is why I say these things,

1:19:57.340 --> 1:20:00.820
 because I like being told what the correct answer is.

1:20:00.820 --> 1:20:04.640
 In any case, so this replaces the upright row

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:07.160
 and probably does a number of other important things as well.

1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:09.360
 Yeah, well, again, listen,

1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:11.520
 without naming names or programs or anything like that,

1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:16.240
 when I got involved in Athlean-X

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:20.160
 when I first started my online presence,

1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:23.340
 there was a very, very, very popular program

1:20:23.340 --> 1:20:25.360
 that was out there that I just, for fun,

1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:28.280
 I wanted to, as a PT, this is the nerdy things we do,

1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:32.760
 but I wanted to evaluate the workout structure.

1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:34.920
 And I went and I looked at every rep

1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:36.360
 over the course of a week,

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:39.720
 and there were something like 890 repetitions

1:20:39.720 --> 1:20:43.080
 or something done and zero of them

1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:45.200
 were dedicated to external rotation of the shoulder.

1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:46.320
 So if you think about it, I mean, yeah,

1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:47.720
 it was a very popular program

1:20:47.720 --> 1:20:48.940
 that was done by a lot of people.

1:20:48.940 --> 1:20:51.200
 There was no focus at all,

1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:55.200
 no dedicated focus towards creating a balance

1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:57.720
 to an action that is so predominant.

1:20:57.720 --> 1:21:01.160
 And remember, it's not just because we sit with that posture

1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:04.980
 but the fact that our chest can internally rotate,

1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:06.760
 our lats can internally rotate.

1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:09.360
 There's like muscle, other big muscles that participate

1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:11.000
 in things that we do every day

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.720
 that will further internally rotate the shoulder.

1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:16.780
 The only weapons we have for external rotation

1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:18.760
 are those little rotator cuff muscles

1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:21.160
 and three of them actually, three of the four.

1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:23.720
 And the job is to sort of actively

1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:25.320
 and consciously train them

1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:27.200
 through really the boring exercises, right?

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:28.600
 Like you've seen them with the band,

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:31.000
 you anchor a band to a pole,

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.180
 you stand with the band in the opposite hand.

1:21:33.180 --> 1:21:35.140
 So if it's anchored to the pole on my left side,

1:21:35.140 --> 1:21:36.680
 I've got the band on my right side,

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:38.720
 and you see people where they kind of rotate their hand

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:39.680
 towards the back.

1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:40.900
 Again, kind of what you were saying,

1:21:40.900 --> 1:21:42.760
 but at a lower elevation,

1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:43.880
 taking the back of my hand

1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:46.840
 and trying to point it to somebody behind me.

1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:51.280
 Well, that is one of the ways to train the muscle.

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.000
 It's just a one function of the shoulder,

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:54.600
 external rotation of the shoulder,

1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:56.480
 and you need to do it.

1:21:56.480 --> 1:21:58.980
 And again, it's not that

1:21:58.980 --> 1:22:01.160
 if somebody was doing more external rotation work,

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:04.220
 could they absorb the upright row better?

1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:07.000
 Probably, because as they elevated the arm,

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.140
 they probably have a little bit more

1:22:09.140 --> 1:22:12.600
 of a contribution from the rotator cuff

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.860
 to what one of the functions is to centralize

1:22:14.860 --> 1:22:17.880
 the head of the humerus inside of the glenoid,

1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:18.720
 you know, the capsule.

1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:20.960
 So as it rises up,

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:24.280
 it stays central as opposed to migrating up,

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:26.520
 because the deltoid likes to pull up.

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:29.440
 So if the rotator cuff has some ability

1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:32.180
 to counteract the upward pull of the delt,

1:22:32.180 --> 1:22:34.640
 then it can maintain a more healthy relationship

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:35.680
 with overhead movement.

1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:37.920
 So just realizing that that function

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:40.840
 is only gained through doing these exercises,

1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:43.800
 you know, we would probably dedicate more time there,

1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:46.800
 but the upright row might be better absorbed by that person

1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:48.400
 because they have a little bit more strength.

1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:50.060
 But again, why?

1:22:50.060 --> 1:22:52.840
 Because if you have an exercise that does the same thing

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:54.640
 for what you're trying to do muscularly

1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:56.760
 to build the muscles that it affects,

1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:59.680
 why wouldn't you just do it where you can still see,

1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:02.320
 actually pick up more repetitions of external rotation?

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:04.360
 You know, so you're getting none of the harm,

1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:07.160
 all of the benefits, I see zero reason

1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:08.560
 to ever do the upright row.

1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:10.480
 And people will argue, this is the way they argue,

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:13.960
 that I've done this for 30 years and I've never hurt myself.

1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:16.960
 And I always say, yet, yet.

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:21.000
 Like, hey listen, the goal is to not hurt yourself ever.

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.640
 So even if you, it's sort of like, you know,

1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:25.760
 the championship game, you know,

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:27.340
 you might play the game of your life,

1:23:27.340 --> 1:23:28.680
 but if you lose, you lost.

1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:30.800
 And when you get into the end of the record books,

1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:31.740
 you're still lost.

1:23:31.740 --> 1:23:34.200
 So even if you had the game of your life, you lost.

1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:36.080
 I don't care if you do it for 30 years, no pain,

1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:38.000
 you're still doing it and there's no pain.

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.160
 I'm giving you an option that's going to give you

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:42.760
 the same results in the exercise that you're seeking.

1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:44.460
 That's why you're doing the exercise

1:23:44.460 --> 1:23:47.920
 without the possibility of having the bad outcome

1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:48.800
 come from it.

1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:50.920
 So, you know, I get a little bit, you know,

1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:53.320
 defensive of the move, but I feel like it's like,

1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:54.620
 why would you do that, you know?

1:23:54.620 --> 1:23:55.600
 No, it makes sense.

1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:58.300
 Being able to train for a long period of time

1:23:58.300 --> 1:24:01.280
 and feel good, you know, I'm proud to say, you know,

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:02.720
 and I don't have the kind of genetics

1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:04.960
 or like we don't have a lot of impressive athletes

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.240
 in our family tree or anything.

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:08.960
 There are some fit individuals, some less fit individuals,

1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:10.880
 but I really believe it's about putting in the work

1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:12.000
 consistently over time.

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.440
 And the more often you can wake up not in pain, the better.

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.020
 And so, you know, I think that being in external rotation

1:24:21.020 --> 1:24:22.120
 as often as possible is good.

1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:25.560
 This is actually a good friend who's a yoga teacher told me

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:27.200
 this is also a problem with the yogis.

1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:28.840
 You know, a lot of, all the downward dog stuff.

1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:31.640
 For those listening, you can think of inward rotation

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:33.400
 as like thumbs down.

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:35.680
 Just like thumbs down, inward rotation isn't bad,

1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:38.520
 but less thumbs down, more thumbs up is external rotation.

1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:41.480
 So for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual.

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:44.280
 The more exercise you can do in external rotation,

1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.440
 the better it seems on average.

1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:50.280
 I'd love to chat with you just a little bit more

1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:52.560
 about biomechanics.

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:56.760
 And this is a personal thing that, again,

1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:59.560
 your content really helped solve for me.

1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:02.000
 One is I thought I had lower back pain,

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:05.800
 but I had sciatica so badly that on a few trips,

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:08.200
 I worked trips years ago when I was doing

1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:09.860
 a lot more international travel.

1:25:09.860 --> 1:25:11.600
 I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes.

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.080
 I mean, like excruciating pain.

1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:14.320
 I didn't want to take medication.

1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:16.740
 I didn't want to do back surgery.

1:25:16.740 --> 1:25:19.740
 In the end, it turns out it wasn't a back injury at all.

1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:23.040
 And one of the things that helped fix it

1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.920
 was this just learning about this thing

1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:26.320
 called the medial glute.

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:29.520
 And you had a video that said fix back pain

1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:31.640
 and then you quite accurately say

1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:34.240
 that some back pain isn't really about the back at all.

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:37.160
 And it had me do an exercise

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:40.680
 or allowed me to try an exercise where I lay on my side

1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:43.840
 and essentially pointing my toe down,

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:46.440
 the top toe down, almost like pointing a toe down,

1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:49.040
 and then would slowly lift the leg up

1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:50.940
 while pointing the toe down.

1:25:50.940 --> 1:25:52.600
 Maybe I got it incorrect here.

1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:54.680
 And then holding that, and there's a muscle

1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:56.200
 that sort of sits at the top of the glute.

1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:57.960
 It kind of peeks out every once in a while.

1:25:57.960 --> 1:25:59.560
 You can feel it there with your thumb,

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:02.860
 which is I think that you had pushed back on it a bit,

1:26:02.860 --> 1:26:04.960
 creating that mind muscle link again.

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:06.600
 And there with proprioception,

1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:10.680
 the actual feeling of a muscle literally with a limb,

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.700
 we know based on the neural circuits for movement

1:26:14.700 --> 1:26:17.580
 that that enhances the contractile ability of a muscle.

1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:18.800
 So like if you touch your bicep,

1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:21.480
 you literally can contract it more strongly.

1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:22.620
 And this makes total sense

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:26.740
 based on neuromuscular physiology.

1:26:26.740 --> 1:26:28.240
 So it had me do that repeatedly.

1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:30.640
 And I started doing that in my hotel room

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:32.300
 and the pain started to disappear.

1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:33.840
 And then it came back again in the afternoon.

1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:35.360
 So I did it again in the afternoon.

1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:37.600
 So this is something I did for three or four days.

1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:40.440
 And lo and behold, my back pain's gone.

1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:42.280
 I handed this off to my father

1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:44.980
 because he, like me, has a slightly lower right shoulder.

1:26:44.980 --> 1:26:47.320
 I think our gait is probably thrown off by this.

1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:48.280
 It's probably a genetic thing.

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:49.120
 Who knows?

1:26:50.060 --> 1:26:52.080
 He handed off to somebody.

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:54.800
 It turns out that we don't suffer from back pain.

1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:56.300
 And in fact, now I don't suffer from any pain

1:26:56.300 --> 1:26:58.080
 because I was doing this exercise,

1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:00.960
 which I think is helping my medial glute.

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.120
 Two reasons why I raised this.

1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:05.620
 One, I know a lot of guys who have right side sciatica

1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:08.360
 because people keep the wallet there is one idea,

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:09.740
 or left side sciatica.

1:27:10.620 --> 1:27:12.200
 There are a lot of people, male and female,

1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:13.160
 who think they have back pain

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:14.600
 when they don't actually have back pain.

1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:16.160
 And the other thing is that,

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:18.380
 is about a general question about biomechanics

1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:19.800
 or statement about biomechanics.

1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:22.780
 I had of a feeling that a lot of what people think

1:27:22.780 --> 1:27:24.840
 is back pain or knee pain or neck pain

1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:26.720
 or headache or shoulder pain

1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:31.120
 is actually the consequence of something that's happening

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:33.760
 above or below that site of pain.

1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:38.000
 And this is a whole landscape of stuff related to PT

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.440
 and recovery and pain management.

1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:43.300
 But maybe you just educate us a bit on this

1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:44.680
 and why this works.

1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:46.040
 What is the medial glute?

1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:48.720
 Why did it make my so-called back pain disappear?

1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:51.080
 And how should people think about pain?

1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:52.240
 And I like to use this as a segue

1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:54.080
 to get into a little bit deeper discussion

1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:55.120
 about pain and recovery.

1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:55.960
 Sure.

1:27:55.960 --> 1:28:00.600
 So this is definitely like a big cornucopia of PT stuff here

1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:02.080
 but like, and this is what I love.

1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:05.360
 So first of all, that video,

1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:07.480
 it's my proudest video that I have.

1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:10.660
 And the reason being is that it's helped so many people.

1:28:10.660 --> 1:28:14.400
 Like we get comments on that video every day.

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:15.240
 I don't even know how many of you

1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:17.720
 just got now 30 some odd million or there's a lot of-

1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:18.600
 We will link to it.

1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:19.920
 Yeah, there's a lot of views.

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:24.560
 And quite honestly, it was a little bit of an afterthought

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:27.600
 video in terms of its origin.

1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:31.040
 I think that that day, maybe Jesse was having some problems

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:32.640
 or something like that, a little bit of low back pain.

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:35.040
 And I showed him and it helped right away.

1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:36.920
 I was like, well, we can make a video on it

1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:39.200
 because this will help people, not everybody.

1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:42.000
 If you have a real disc problem, it's not going to help

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.820
 because you're not changing the structural problem

1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:45.960
 that's there.

1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:48.320
 But as you said, a lot of people don't.

1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:51.680
 And even disc issues, a lot of them are non-operative.

1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:54.260
 So you'd want to try these things first.

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:57.520
 As far as what you sort of experienced,

1:28:57.520 --> 1:28:59.800
 sometimes as that glute medius really tightens down

1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:02.480
 and that's again from poor biomechanics

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:03.960
 up and down the kinetic chain,

1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:06.480
 it can actually press on the sciatic nerve

1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:09.040
 and give you what they call a pseudo sciatica.

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:12.680
 Where it's not like you're making it up.

1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:14.240
 It's not like you're not feeling that pain

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:16.380
 over that same sciatic distribution,

1:29:16.380 --> 1:29:18.200
 but it's not caused from a disc.

1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:20.680
 It's not caused from something mechanical there.

1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:23.640
 It's caused by the fact that this glute medius

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:27.680
 has posturally become a problem for you or weak

1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:30.800
 because you don't train it and you need to address it.

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:34.120
 So not unlike any other muscle in the body,

1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:37.180
 there are common trigger points and common areas

1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.600
 where the muscle will become tightened or painful

1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:45.480
 or spasm and you can basically apply pressure

1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:49.400
 to these areas and then sort of thread that muscle

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:51.840
 through the pressure by pushing down through there

1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:53.420
 and then contracting the muscle,

1:29:53.420 --> 1:29:56.520
 which is why you go through that action of,

1:29:56.520 --> 1:29:58.000
 I think we call it a toe stabber,

1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.120
 but like stabbing down and lifting up

1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:01.400
 and stabbing down and lifting up,

1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:04.000
 taking that glute medius through its function

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:07.000
 so that it's basically kind of working underneath

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.840
 the downward pressure of the finger.

1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:13.440
 And that tends to help you to almost need out

1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:15.640
 what might be that trigger point.

1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:18.000
 And that's why people can see immediate relief there

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.960
 because once the trigger point lets go, it feels like,

1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:23.800
 and that's what the comments are in that video.

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:25.940
 Like my God, I literally, I couldn't walk.

1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:27.320
 I've been on my hotel floor.

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:29.240
 I did this and I'm fixed.

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.520
 And meanwhile, then it could come back

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:32.720
 because your body is like, well,

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.080
 I like being more like this.

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:37.680
 This is how I've been ingrained to be.

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:38.520
 So it might come back,

1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:40.560
 but then when you do another round of it

1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:41.400
 and another round of it,

1:30:41.400 --> 1:30:42.640
 and then finally it starts to say, all right,

1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:43.480
 I'm not going to do that anymore.

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:45.280
 It kind of eases up and you can relieve yourself

1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:47.160
 of those trigger points.

1:30:47.160 --> 1:30:49.520
 You could do that up and down the back.

1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:50.520
 There's other people that get that

1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:53.040
 and that sort of inside their shoulder blade,

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:56.880
 that same type of cramping in another area.

1:30:56.880 --> 1:31:00.040
 But once that takes place,

1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:02.080
 well then the job that I think people have

1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:04.840
 is like become educated that the glute medius

1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:06.680
 is different than the glute maximus.

1:31:06.680 --> 1:31:08.600
 Their functions are different.

1:31:08.600 --> 1:31:12.220
 You have to work on not just extending the hip,

1:31:12.220 --> 1:31:13.960
 but also abduction of the hip,

1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:15.320
 external rotation of the hip.

1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:17.600
 Same thing as in the shoulder.

1:31:17.600 --> 1:31:18.920
 And this actually segues nicely

1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:20.720
 into the whole concept you were talking about.

1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:22.840
 Like the body is like a mirror image.

1:31:22.840 --> 1:31:24.440
 The hip is like the shoulder, right?

1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:26.080
 The ankle is the wrist.

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:27.200
 The foot is the hand.

1:31:27.200 --> 1:31:29.460
 Like the knee is the elbow.

1:31:29.460 --> 1:31:30.520
 They're two hinge joints.

1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:31.500
 They function that way.

1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:32.880
 Well, with the shoulder,

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:34.920
 you've got that mobility that comes

1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:37.120
 from having all that freedom of motion,

1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:38.700
 but the stability is lacking.

1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:39.880
 Well, the same thing with the hip.

1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:41.480
 Like you've got mobility,

1:31:41.480 --> 1:31:43.460
 but if you don't fully stabilize it

1:31:43.460 --> 1:31:45.640
 by training all of the muscles of the hip,

1:31:45.640 --> 1:31:46.800
 and if you don't strengthen

1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:49.120
 the external rotation of the hip,

1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:52.340
 then you're gonna have issues.

1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:55.000
 Like it's not biomechanically gonna work the same way.

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:59.040
 If you think of the body as a series of bands

1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:00.280
 pulling in different directions

1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:02.480
 at different levels of tension,

1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:05.280
 you're being pulled into one direction or the other

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:09.000
 just by the balance of tension from one weak area

1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.160
 to one dominantly tight area.

1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:12.480
 And you need to make sure

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:14.420
 that you can sort of balance this out

1:32:14.420 --> 1:32:16.920
 in order to eliminate some of the adaptations

1:32:16.920 --> 1:32:18.920
 and compensations that happen.

1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:23.920
 So what I say when we look at sort of the body as a whole,

1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:27.980
 most often wherever you're feeling the pain

1:32:27.980 --> 1:32:30.600
 is absolutely not to blame.

1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:31.480
 There's not blame.

1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:34.080
 It is somewhere above or below as you hinted at.

1:32:34.080 --> 1:32:36.320
 You know, you're talking about the knee

1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:38.020
 is my favorite example of it.

1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:40.260
 Whenever you have knee pain,

1:32:40.260 --> 1:32:43.080
 patellar tendonitis, which I have forever,

1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:45.360
 I've had bad, bad cases of patellar tendonitis

1:32:45.360 --> 1:32:48.400
 where squatting is very difficult for me.

1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:49.240
 It's not the knee.

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:51.520
 The knee is literally a hinge joint

1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:54.580
 that there's minor rotation capabilities in the knee,

1:32:54.580 --> 1:32:56.040
 but it's a hinge joint.

1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:00.240
 And it's being impacted by the hip and the ankle

1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:01.240
 and in the foot.

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:03.640
 As I said before, how critical the foot is.

1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:06.960
 If you thought of the knee being

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:08.480
 like the middle of a train track

1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:10.380
 where the femur down your thigh

1:33:10.380 --> 1:33:13.820
 and your shin down below your knee were the train track,

1:33:13.820 --> 1:33:16.780
 what would happen if the foot collapses at the bottom?

1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:19.240
 All of a sudden that train track on the bottom

1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:21.360
 gets torqued just a little bit.

1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:23.640
 Well, who's going to feel that the most?

1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:25.740
 The area where it's torquing, which is at the knee.

1:33:25.740 --> 1:33:27.200
 So the stresses are going to be felt there.

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:28.800
 Meanwhile, the problem is the foot

1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:30.260
 or the problem is the ankle.

1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:32.800
 People that are chronic ankle sprainers

1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:35.500
 are almost always going to wind up having back pain

1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:39.020
 because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations

1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:41.840
 in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain.

1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:44.960
 Because now once I distort the ankle and the shin,

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:47.120
 now the knee is trying to maintain

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:49.420
 its ability to hinge smoothly.

1:33:49.420 --> 1:33:52.160
 So it torques on the femur to do that.

1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:53.940
 Well, the femur is now inside the hip joint

1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:56.440
 pulling on the pelvis and the pelvis is out of whack.

1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.480
 So it really is fascinating.

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:01.580
 Like it's one of my favorite things about how the body works

1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:04.560
 is like how interconnected it is

1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:06.600
 and how one little thing somewhere

1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:08.560
 causes repercussions somewhere else.

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:12.160
 And the easiest way to find out what your problem is

1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:14.100
 is to say, okay, I know where my symptom is,

1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:16.040
 but I got to find someone who can help me

1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:17.880
 find the source somewhere else.

1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:20.420
 Because it is going to be usually either above or below.

1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:21.600
 Mostly usually below

1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:23.960
 because it usually translates up the kinetic chain.

1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:26.820
 But usually it's going to be below where the real source is.

1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:29.960
 So people with low back pain usually have hip issues,

1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:32.800
 weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues.

1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:35.120
 It's almost always below.

1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:38.780
 When you get into really high performance athletics though,

1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:40.160
 it almost works the other way.

1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:43.200
 Like where we have pitchers who can't,

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:44.800
 I mean, I'm always fascinated by guys

1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:47.760
 that have Tommy John issues, you know,

1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:49.000
 in their elbow, right, pitchers.

1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.960
 Like if you can't externally rotate the shoulder

1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:54.040
 that we talked about, again,

1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:55.720
 the ability to get your shoulder back

1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:57.440
 into external rotation,

1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:01.100
 well, your arm has to get to a certain position

1:35:01.100 --> 1:35:02.920
 for release of the baseball.

1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:04.400
 And if it can't get there,

1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:06.880
 cause you can't externally rotate the shoulder to get there,

1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:09.840
 then the elbow has to sort of torque more

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:12.840
 in order to allow the arm to get back further.

1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:15.120
 And it will try to take some of that motion

1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:16.760
 from a joint that's not really, again,

1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:18.680
 another, you know, the hinge joint,

1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:19.880
 really capable of doing that.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.200
 So it starts to stress that medial elbow ligament

1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:23.700
 to get a little bit further back

1:35:23.700 --> 1:35:25.320
 because the shoulder's not working.

1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:27.780
 And that just ultimately places strain on the elbow.

1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:32.280
 So when you see a guy that has pain that floats around,

1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:34.260
 a pitcher that floats around their arm,

1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:36.840
 all that is is sort of this balance of compensation.

1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:38.800
 Once his shoulder elbow starts hurting,

1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:41.880
 then he can't do the, get the range from the elbow.

1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:44.080
 So he tries to dig a little bit further back

1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:45.200
 into external rotation

1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:46.760
 and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed.

1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:48.320
 And then he feels that's inflamed.

1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:50.080
 So, and by the way, during that time period,

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:51.240
 it takes some of the strain off the elbow

1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:52.500
 so the elbow feels better.

1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:55.080
 Then he decides, okay, now I got the extra rotation,

1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:56.360
 but I'm getting too much of that.

1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.280
 So now I start straining the elbow again

1:35:58.280 --> 1:35:59.880
 and it keeps going through this cycle.

1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:03.240
 So your body is very smart

1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:05.720
 and it's going to compensate every single time.

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:06.960
 It's going to find the compensation,

1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:08.920
 but there's no guarantee that that conversation

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:11.400
 doesn't leave you with a whole host of other issues.

1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:13.040
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:15.680
 In another lifetime, I would have gone and been a PT,

1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:18.400
 although it sounds like the community among PTs online.

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:21.120
 I don't know what, listen, we're good people, but it's like.

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:22.680
 Yeah, scientists and neuroscientists

1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:24.480
 can get into pretty intense battles.

1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:26.600
 You know, coming from the academic community,

1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:28.700
 you know, the etiquette is so different online

1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:30.440
 because I would say, you know, I think in person,

1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:32.160
 people would probably behave a bit differently.

1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:33.120
 They shake your hand and say hello.

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:34.520
 Yeah, they shake your hand and say hello.

1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:39.040
 And there's also, look, I'll just be very direct about this.

1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:41.280
 There are a lot of people online for whom

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:45.120
 their only content is pointing out the misunderstandings

1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:46.920
 or alleged flaws of other people.

1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:49.600
 There's like, where it's like the bulk of their identity,

1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.580
 which to me is sort of a sad existence,

1:36:51.580 --> 1:36:53.840
 but you know, there's always more to gain

1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:55.000
 by thinking about what's possible

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.400
 and what's new and what's good,

1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:00.360
 but you know, to each their own demise or win.

1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:03.400
 I mean, questioning what's out there is healthy,

1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:06.560
 it's normal, it's great, it actually sparks conversation.

1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:08.080
 But as you said, some people's existence

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:11.100
 is solely to find things to, you know,

1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:13.480
 nag about and not actually with the goal

1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:16.600
 being to advance anything, but rather just to, you know.

1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:18.400
 Yeah, in the world of science,

1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:22.320
 being skeptical but not cynical is encouraged.

1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:25.120
 But I would say that the longer that somebody's

1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:27.800
 in a career path, it's certainly in science or medicine,

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:30.800
 and they realize how hard it is to, you know,

1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:31.880
 to do various studies.

1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:33.120
 Once they publish a few studies,

1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:36.040
 generally they sort of get a better understanding

1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:38.000
 of how the various things are done.

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000
 In any case, another, along the lines of pain

1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:45.380
 and pain relief and misunderstandings

1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:47.240
 about the origins of pain in the body,

1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:50.900
 one of the great tools that I picked up from your content,

1:37:50.900 --> 1:37:54.320
 which has benefited, I know, a huge number of people is,

1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:56.400
 I think I used to hold weights sometimes

1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:58.760
 in the tips of my fingers, as opposed to in the meat

1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:01.680
 of the palm of my hands, and I had elbow pain.

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:03.400
 And I always thought that I felt it most

1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:05.640
 on tricep exercises and pushing exercises,

1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:07.880
 and I thought I was doing those exercises wrong.

1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:11.200
 Turns out, toward the end of my pull-ups or my bicep work,

1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:12.960
 I was letting the weight or the bar drift

1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:16.680
 into my fingertips, and the mere shift

1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:19.280
 to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:22.560
 or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:24.520
 has completely ameliorated that,

1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:26.160
 for reasons that you point out,

1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:28.480
 and maybe you could just share with us why that is.

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:30.680
 You have this kind of finger-pull exercise.

1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:32.060
 Usually when someone says, pull my finger,

1:38:32.060 --> 1:38:34.340
 it's like a bad middle school or elementary school joke,

1:38:34.340 --> 1:38:35.180
 but you're-

1:38:35.180 --> 1:38:36.120
 Well, this one will say, push your finger.

1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:37.680
 Right, right.

1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:38.920
 Yeah, this is fascinating.

1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:40.920
 This is, because it just shows, again,

1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:43.160
 how intricate the body is and how responsive

1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:45.960
 or over-responsive it can be to something so little.

1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:49.020
 And what you're talking about is that

1:38:49.020 --> 1:38:51.680
 when you grip a bar, whether it be through a curl

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:54.440
 or whether it be, and this is mostly pulling exercises

1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:56.740
 because the tendency for the bar is gonna be

1:38:56.740 --> 1:38:58.160
 to fall out of your hand,

1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:00.080
 not like with a pushing exercise where it's kind of,

1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:01.680
 you're pushing your hand into the bar.

1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:03.040
 So on a bench press, say.

1:39:04.140 --> 1:39:08.820
 That bar can drift just by gravity, doing its thing,

1:39:08.820 --> 1:39:12.460
 or fatigue of the hand grip strength,

1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:14.320
 can start to drift further away

1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:16.600
 towards the distal digits, right,

1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:18.920
 through those last couple knuckles

1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:20.320
 that we have on our hands.

1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:24.480
 And though our hand can still hold it there,

1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:28.480
 the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads.

1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:31.680
 And that can start at a very, I'm not gonna say light,

1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:34.080
 but like, you know, it could start at, you know,

1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:37.400
 dumbbell weight, you know, 40 pounds, 30 pounds,

1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:38.960
 you know, even 25 pounds or something,

1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:40.960
 depending upon their overall strength levels.

1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:43.580
 But then when you start to apply it to something like

1:39:43.580 --> 1:39:46.280
 your body weight with a chin up, right,

1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:49.040
 because that's natural for the bar to somewhat kind of

1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:50.880
 float down towards your fingertips.

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:53.320
 And it actually is a little bit easier

1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:56.800
 to perform the exercise with that sort of like false grip,

1:39:56.800 --> 1:39:58.120
 little hook grip at the end,

1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:00.840
 because you're not gonna engage the forearms

1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:01.680
 into the exercise.

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:04.180
 You're not gonna start pulling down.

1:40:04.180 --> 1:40:05.860
 But at the same time,

1:40:05.860 --> 1:40:08.440
 while it could help you to perform them better

1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:10.280
 by getting the back more activated,

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.160
 if you have weakness in these muscles,

1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:13.760
 because it's not a thing that happens to every,

1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:15.800
 it's not one of those upright row type things

1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:18.200
 where I think this is happening to everybody.

1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:19.600
 This is happening to people that have

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:23.600
 these inherent weaknesses in these muscles.

1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:26.720
 You, or having done enough of the gripping in the fore,

1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:29.840
 in the meat of the hand, you know, for long enough,

1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:33.440
 but it starts to put that stress on these muscles

1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:35.920
 that are ill-equipped to do this and to handle this.

1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:39.240
 And it starts to, particularly on that fourth finger,

1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:41.800
 you know, which is part of the muscle we call the FDS,

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:43.000
 the flexor digitorum,

1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.420
 that is just too much for it to handle.

1:40:45.420 --> 1:40:46.840
 And that comes all the way down

1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:48.360
 and meets right at the medial elbow,

1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.000
 right on that spot that you can say

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000
 feels like someone's knifing you right in the middle,

1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:53.160
 in that medial elbow.

1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:55.040
 And medial epicondylitis,

1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:56.720
 or they call it golfer's elbow,

1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:59.840
 is something that a lot of us deal with in the gym.

1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:02.420
 It's one of the most common inflammatory conditions

1:41:02.420 --> 1:41:03.540
 people get from the gym.

1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:07.420
 And it all comes from this positioning of the dumbbell

1:41:07.420 --> 1:41:10.520
 or barbell or hand on a pull-up bar over time.

1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:13.600
 So the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper

1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.680
 so that what you're doing is you're using more leverage

1:41:16.680 --> 1:41:19.400
 from the palm to encapsulate the bar

1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:20.780
 or the dumbbell or whatever.

1:41:20.780 --> 1:41:23.640
 And you're not putting that pressure really distally

1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:25.520
 right on that last digit

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:29.480
 because that's where that FDS muscle is most strained.

1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:33.240
 So you're just almost eliminating that from the equation.

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:35.800
 And it's one of those exercises

1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:39.080
 that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly

1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:40.280
 so that like, you know,

1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:43.100
 maybe it's only capable of handling 30 pounds.

1:41:43.100 --> 1:41:44.440
 And then when you're doing a chin up

1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:47.180
 and it goes and it drifts so far that it's,

1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:49.680
 now let's say you're a 200 pound guy,

1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:52.160
 you've got, let's say 100 pounds through one arm

1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:54.260
 and 100 pounds, this is simplified math

1:41:54.260 --> 1:41:55.960
 that obviously is offset by other muscles,

1:41:55.960 --> 1:41:58.160
 but 100 pounds through one arm, 100 pounds through the other,

1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:00.960
 100 pounds off of a muscle that can handle 30,

1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:03.580
 it's not gonna take many repetitions to strain it.

1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:06.440
 And you're gonna feel that maybe by the time that sets over

1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:08.040
 or certainly by the time that workout's over

1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:09.080
 or the next day you wake up,

1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:11.360
 you've got that notable stabbing pain.

1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:13.320
 Whenever someone feels that,

1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:15.200
 the best thing would be to determine,

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:18.080
 okay, what exercises was I doing that were pulling

1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:20.080
 and where the bar could have drifted deeper

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:24.360
 further from the meat of my palm into my fingers

1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:26.400
 and figure out a way to deepen that grip.

1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:28.440
 When that happens though, the best thing to do

1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:30.640
 with most of these inflammatory conditions

1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:33.240
 is not do any of that stuff for a little while.

1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:35.400
 Not ever, just for a little while.

1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:37.340
 There's always things that you can do around it.

1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:40.040
 I'm not saying ever do I say like, don't go to the gym

1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:41.880
 or don't find something you can do,

1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:44.280
 but I'm saying that particular exercise

1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:47.280
 that you feel the pain on while you're doing it,

1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:51.400
 never a smart idea to do that exercise when it's inflamed.

1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:53.080
 If you are doing the exercise and it hurts,

1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:54.640
 you probably shouldn't do the exercise

1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:59.640
 because another reason for the variability of exercise

1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:02.740
 is there's so many other options that you can do

1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:05.500
 that will train similar muscles or even the same motion

1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:07.100
 and not cause that stress.

1:43:07.100 --> 1:43:11.160
 So a cable curl would be much easier to do that on

1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:13.720
 than let's say a chin up where you don't have the control

1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:16.980
 over the weight like you do by moving a pin on a stack.

1:43:16.980 --> 1:43:21.500
 So I think that is a common thing that people find

1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:23.520
 and the best thing to do is just figure out

1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:25.400
 how deep are you gripping that bar

1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:26.420
 and you're going to find that, oh my God,

1:43:26.420 --> 1:43:27.920
 I didn't realize that because it was just,

1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:30.560
 even though you might start a set in a good position

1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:32.600
 and then it drifts away as you go.

1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:34.500
 Yeah, I think that's what was happening to me

1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:35.920
 and I'm very conscious of this now.

1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:39.920
 Again, for me, I haven't had this elbow pain at all,

1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:42.120
 so very fortunate.

1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:44.680
 So again, a debt of gratitude to you.

1:43:44.680 --> 1:43:48.080
 Never, I thought there was some roll in my elbow basically.

1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:49.680
 And I thought maybe it was tennis elbow.

1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:52.180
 I don't even play tennis, so there you go.

1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:57.760
 Other aspects of recovery and variables for recovery.

1:43:57.760 --> 1:43:59.560
 I think you and I both put out content

1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:01.800
 about the use of cold and I think we can summarize it

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:04.500
 by saying, yeah, it does seem like cold water immersion

1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:07.400
 immediately after hypertrophy or strength workouts

1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:08.720
 might be a problem, but a cold shower

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:09.680
 is probably not a problem.

1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:11.160
 What about heat?

1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:15.120
 Do you personally use heat and cold saunas,

1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:18.020
 hot baths, hot compresses?

1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:23.040
 And by you, I mean you personally and athletes

1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:25.440
 that you coach or people that you coach,

1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:28.300
 what are your thoughts on the use of heat and or cold?

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:32.560
 Well, I think it might just be an inherited practice

1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:36.960
 from the days of trainers since Babe Ruth.

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:39.120
 But in baseball, we used a lot of cold

1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:43.440
 following performance just because the idea would be

1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:45.480
 there is some, especially pitchers,

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:48.360
 there is some inflammation that is abnormal.

1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:50.600
 The arm is not really designed to do what they do,

1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:53.020
 especially at the speed that they move it

1:44:53.020 --> 1:44:53.880
 and everything else.

1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:56.980
 So we would use ice as a pretty standard practice

1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:00.360
 after that, but not a lot of heat.

1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:01.640
 And I don't really use a lot of heat.

1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:04.920
 And of course, from the recovery or the healing aspect,

1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:08.960
 that actually becomes rather personal preference

1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:13.840
 they've found now after let's say the first 12 to 24 hours,

1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:15.600
 where you're really trying to control inflammation

1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:17.380
 of what you know might be an injury.

1:45:17.380 --> 1:45:19.520
 But then it can kind of shift the personal preference

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:22.800
 because the heat can bring blood to the area also.

1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:27.240
 And then the cold has its sort of anti-inflammatory effects.

1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:29.360
 So there's a balance between

1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:31.000
 which one's working better for you.

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.560
 So there's really no standard anymore

1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:34.320
 for heat or cold in that way.

1:45:34.320 --> 1:45:39.320
 But from a standpoint of like post-workout healthy status,

1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:42.760
 I haven't used much heat or cold in terms of what we do.

1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:44.520
 We cover the topic of the cold showers

1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:46.720
 and to try to dispel the myth of the,

1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:50.940
 even people saying that there's giant testosterone releases

1:45:50.940 --> 1:45:52.920
 and all kinds of stuff that,

1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:54.360
 listen, we hear all kinds of things

1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:55.360
 because people want like,

1:45:55.360 --> 1:45:58.120
 I think the idea of just turning the water cold

1:45:58.120 --> 1:45:59.640
 and being in it for 30 seconds

1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:01.160
 and then all of a sudden magically growing

1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:04.120
 three times your size is intriguing for a lot of people.

1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:05.980
 And that's why they ask these questions

1:46:05.980 --> 1:46:07.480
 because they're like, that'd be a hell of a lot easier

1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:09.880
 than going to the gym and training hard.

1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:11.900
 But I'm always fascinated by some of the stuff

1:46:11.900 --> 1:46:13.360
 that you talked about.

1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:15.320
 In fact, we started to talk about some of this stuff

1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:18.160
 in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance.

1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:22.320
 And that was like, there's some untapped territory there

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:24.800
 that I think you're finding out about.

1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:25.800
 Yeah, what would be fun would be

1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:28.320
 to bring the cool MIT technology from Stanford.

1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:30.880
 This is Craig Heller, my colleague Craig Heller's lab

1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.760
 at Stanford has done really important

1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:35.160
 and amazing work in this area,

1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:36.720
 but then it moved on to some other things.

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:38.200
 He's also working on Down syndrome

1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:40.480
 and he works on a number of other really important topics

1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:42.080
 as scientists often do.

1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:44.640
 But I have access to this cool MIT technology,

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:46.320
 no relationship to the company, by the way.

1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:47.800
 We'd love to come out to your facility

1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:52.080
 and we can do the blind type studies.

1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:53.040
 Like the blue blocker test.

1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:54.840
 Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:59.400
 And see how that goes with somebody

1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:01.600
 as advanced trained as you.

1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:02.480
 That's probably the best thing to do.

1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:04.760
 So content for the future.

1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:07.760
 Yeah, I think heat and cold are kind of staples

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:08.600
 in the PT world.

1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:11.480
 And it does seem like people use them slightly differently,

1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:14.160
 but they are kind of the macronutrients

1:47:14.160 --> 1:47:16.540
 of recovery there along with sleep.

1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:23.000
 I do have a question about precision of record keeping.

1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.400
 Do you keep a training journal?

1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:27.700
 Do you recommend people keep training journals?

1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:30.040
 Are you neurotically fixed to, you know,

1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:32.800
 cadence of movement and are you looking at the,

1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:34.400
 do you have a buzzer going off for night

1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:35.640
 when it's 90 seconds rest?

1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:36.920
 Is it 90 seconds rest?

1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:40.240
 I confess I have my slow workouts and my faster workouts.

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:42.560
 And they scale with whether or not I'm training heavier

1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:44.920
 with longer rest or whether or not

1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:46.060
 maybe midway through a workout,

1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:48.320
 I'll shift over to doing higher repetition, lower rest.

1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.320
 This is kind of my crude way of keeping time,

1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:55.960
 but I'm not, you know, will be just to kind of watch

1:47:55.960 --> 1:47:59.840
 the clock, but I'm not neurotically fixed to the buzzer.

1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:02.400
 Nor am I on social media during my workouts,

1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:05.000
 which is actually a way to really improve workouts

1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.840
 is to just not be on social media.

1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:10.500
 Yeah, I can't claim that I'm not guilty of that.

1:48:10.500 --> 1:48:12.040
 Sometimes I am on social media,

1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:13.560
 but sometimes I'm trying to post something.

1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:14.400
 Well, that's different.

1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:16.200
 It's your profession, it's your profession.

1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:21.200
 But I mean, I'm not necessarily chained

1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:27.240
 to some sort of protocol in terms of how I do.

1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:29.760
 I think by this point, I've been doing this a long time.

1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:31.600
 And not only is it something that I've done for a long time,

1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:33.720
 but it's a passion of mine, something I really enjoy.

1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:36.720
 So I probably inherently have the ability

1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:40.680
 to stick to these guidelines in terms of rest time

1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:45.680
 to know what I lifted, you know, even six months ago

1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:49.660
 on a lift and how it felt without journaling it.

1:48:49.660 --> 1:48:52.860
 But I recognize the value it has to a lot of people.

1:48:52.860 --> 1:48:55.860
 It goes back to that whole, my muscle connection idea

1:48:55.860 --> 1:48:57.020
 that we talked about in the beginning.

1:48:57.020 --> 1:48:58.860
 Like there's a lack of awareness

1:48:58.860 --> 1:49:00.580
 for all aspects of training,

1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:02.980
 especially maybe isn't like your interest level.

1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:07.140
 And we're talking you and I from a position of interest.

1:49:07.140 --> 1:49:07.980
 Like this is what we do.

1:49:07.980 --> 1:49:10.940
 We enjoy just how our bodies work

1:49:10.940 --> 1:49:12.100
 and understanding how they work.

1:49:12.100 --> 1:49:13.020
 Some people don't care.

1:49:13.020 --> 1:49:14.420
 They just want the end result.

1:49:14.420 --> 1:49:17.500
 But journaling and keeping track of that

1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:18.740
 raises awareness to where like,

1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:21.620
 oh my God, I have been on Instagram

1:49:21.620 --> 1:49:22.940
 for the last seven minutes.

1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:26.060
 And I was supposed to be back at my next set in 90 seconds.

1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:28.300
 Like there is a training effect of that.

1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:32.100
 You know, if you're training for a metabolic overload,

1:49:32.100 --> 1:49:34.500
 you've blown that opportunity because you haven't,

1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:38.180
 you know, your rest time was very important

1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:40.780
 to that protocol working as it should.

1:49:40.780 --> 1:49:42.060
 If you were training for strength,

1:49:42.060 --> 1:49:44.160
 maybe the extra few minutes doesn't matter so much.

1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:46.140
 When you get back on the bar, you might find,

1:49:46.140 --> 1:49:48.660
 I mean, you might find that it's a better response

1:49:48.660 --> 1:49:50.220
 for your body to rest even longer

1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:53.420
 than you've been told three, four minutes, five minutes.

1:49:53.420 --> 1:49:54.900
 And so that way maybe it helps.

1:49:54.900 --> 1:49:57.960
 But I think that anything you can do

1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:00.300
 to increase your awareness of your performance

1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:04.340
 and also give yourself some objective goal

1:50:04.340 --> 1:50:05.820
 whenever we have an objective goal,

1:50:05.820 --> 1:50:07.460
 it's a lot easier to actually obtain it.

1:50:07.460 --> 1:50:09.520
 When you're just there to get a pump

1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:12.700
 and you're just there to lift how you feel that day,

1:50:13.700 --> 1:50:15.380
 you have to be incredibly disciplined

1:50:15.380 --> 1:50:17.140
 in all other aspects of your workout

1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:18.660
 in order to make that effective.

1:50:18.660 --> 1:50:20.020
 You know, and I've done that too.

1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:21.840
 I've actually been able to do that too.

1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:25.300
 But again, the level of repetitions I've accumulated

1:50:25.300 --> 1:50:26.380
 over the course of my life

1:50:26.380 --> 1:50:29.800
 and the amount that I, you know, read about this stuff.

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:32.140
 And I think I'm able to get away with that.

1:50:32.140 --> 1:50:34.480
 But I think more often than not,

1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:36.580
 what I'm doing is not journaling,

1:50:36.580 --> 1:50:38.820
 but journaling in my head

1:50:38.820 --> 1:50:40.900
 exactly what I think people should be doing.

1:50:40.900 --> 1:50:42.940
 And that is getting a specific effect

1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:44.260
 from what you're trying to do.

1:50:44.260 --> 1:50:45.700
 It's not so haphazard.

1:50:45.700 --> 1:50:47.380
 You know, you want to get a specific effect,

1:50:47.380 --> 1:50:49.220
 just like any other experiment that you're doing.

1:50:49.220 --> 1:50:50.940
 You're doing an experiment on your own body

1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:51.860
 with your own weights,

1:50:51.860 --> 1:50:54.740
 which to me is one of the most empowering things

1:50:54.740 --> 1:50:55.560
 someone can ever do.

1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:57.380
 When they get bitten by the bug

1:50:57.380 --> 1:51:00.400
 for exercising and training,

1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:01.900
 and I like to use the word training

1:51:01.900 --> 1:51:03.980
 rather than exercise because there's a purpose behind it.

1:51:03.980 --> 1:51:06.140
 But when they get bitten by that training bug

1:51:06.140 --> 1:51:08.740
 and they start to see actual changes and results,

1:51:08.740 --> 1:51:09.720
 you know how empowering that is?

1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:11.700
 Because we can't really control

1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:13.700
 that many things in our life, unfortunately.

1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:15.180
 And there's some things that happen to us

1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:17.620
 that we really wish never happened.

1:51:17.620 --> 1:51:19.980
 And those are not something that we can do anything about.

1:51:19.980 --> 1:51:22.460
 But this is one thing that we can do our best to.

1:51:22.460 --> 1:51:24.260
 We can't avoid disease entirely.

1:51:24.260 --> 1:51:25.860
 We can't predict when we're going to die.

1:51:25.860 --> 1:51:27.940
 We can't, you know, do those things,

1:51:27.940 --> 1:51:31.020
 but we can certainly decide to show up into the gym that day

1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:33.740
 and get a workout in or go for a run or do something.

1:51:33.740 --> 1:51:35.640
 And by doing that, you're giving yourself,

1:51:35.640 --> 1:51:38.020
 I think, a better chance at a higher quality of life.

1:51:38.020 --> 1:51:41.060
 So anything you can do to increase your awareness of it

1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:43.060
 and keep you on track with that is,

1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:44.900
 like I'm endorsing, fully.

1:51:44.900 --> 1:51:46.020
 Couldn't agree more.

1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:47.300
 I could not agree more.

1:51:48.700 --> 1:51:50.820
 There is a topic, it's sort of a dreaded topic,

1:51:50.820 --> 1:51:51.900
 but I think it's an important one,

1:51:51.900 --> 1:51:54.140
 and that's the topic of nutrition.

1:51:54.140 --> 1:51:56.700
 And rather than get into specific meal programs,

1:51:56.700 --> 1:51:58.820
 which would, you know, take hours

1:51:58.820 --> 1:52:01.840
 and probably wouldn't even manage to scratch the surface,

1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:02.900
 even with hours,

1:52:03.860 --> 1:52:07.400
 we could talk about principles around nutrition.

1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:08.820
 What are sort of the themes

1:52:08.820 --> 1:52:11.480
 that you think people should keep in mind

1:52:11.480 --> 1:52:14.320
 when thinking about how to eat generally?

1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:19.100
 And pre-training and post-training

1:52:19.100 --> 1:52:22.020
 are two particularly sensitive times for most,

1:52:22.020 --> 1:52:24.780
 or times that people want to know a lot about.

1:52:24.780 --> 1:52:26.500
 You know, what should they eat before training?

1:52:26.500 --> 1:52:27.820
 Or can they train fast?

1:52:27.820 --> 1:52:29.020
 What should they eat afterwards?

1:52:29.020 --> 1:52:29.860
 But just in general,

1:52:29.860 --> 1:52:33.780
 what do you think are some axioms of nutrition

1:52:33.780 --> 1:52:34.980
 that really hold?

1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:37.700
 And I ask this because,

1:52:37.700 --> 1:52:40.440
 not because there's a lot of debate about this,

1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:43.440
 but because you've been around this space a long time

1:52:43.440 --> 1:52:46.460
 and you've seen what works for you, obviously,

1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:48.540
 but for other people too.

1:52:48.540 --> 1:52:51.860
 You know, what tends to work, what tends not to work?

1:52:51.860 --> 1:52:54.380
 And how should we think about nutrition?

1:52:54.380 --> 1:52:58.200
 I mean, look, you've touched on it a bit, but like,

1:52:58.200 --> 1:53:00.540
 nutrition can be a touchy subject for people.

1:53:00.540 --> 1:53:02.760
 And I understand where that comes from.

1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:05.500
 I've talked about before the,

1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:07.880
 there's a dogmatic tendency to nutrition.

1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:10.380
 And there's a reason for it because

1:53:10.380 --> 1:53:12.340
 it's an area that people struggle with

1:53:12.340 --> 1:53:13.420
 more than anything else.

1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:15.500
 And the reason why people struggle with nutrition

1:53:15.500 --> 1:53:18.340
 is because the commitment is extremely high.

1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:21.820
 You know, you could start a workout program

1:53:21.820 --> 1:53:24.660
 and actually get to the gym three to five times a week.

1:53:24.660 --> 1:53:26.140
 That's five hours

1:53:26.140 --> 1:53:28.480
 based on how you and I were discussing it before.

1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:31.840
 Well, what about the other 23 hours of each of those days?

1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:35.940
 There's opportunity to eat incorrectly or unhealthily.

1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:37.260
 Every one of those hours,

1:53:37.260 --> 1:53:38.980
 people wake up in the middle of the night to go eat.

1:53:38.980 --> 1:53:42.260
 You know, like there are things that you can do

1:53:42.260 --> 1:53:47.080
 that can cause amazing amounts of damage to your longevity.

1:53:47.080 --> 1:53:50.380
 In the 23 hours, not the one hour, the 23 hours.

1:53:50.380 --> 1:53:54.000
 So when people finally figure out a way

1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:57.940
 to make that work for them, it's very passionate.

1:53:57.940 --> 1:53:59.800
 And I understand their passion.

1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.060
 I do, like I've put out.

1:54:01.060 --> 1:54:02.700
 So my approach, my approach is like,

1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:06.640
 I've always been sort of a low sugar, lower fat guy.

1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:09.300
 I made the mistake of going no fat years ago

1:54:09.300 --> 1:54:10.140
 and I paid for it.

1:54:10.140 --> 1:54:11.700
 I was like in college and you know,

1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:13.300
 back in the day we were the same age.

1:54:13.300 --> 1:54:15.060
 You know, we read all the magazines

1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:16.920
 and that was what we had, we didn't have internet then.

1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:19.980
 So we were reading magazines and the recommended path

1:54:19.980 --> 1:54:21.180
 was to go low fat.

1:54:22.140 --> 1:54:25.580
 It helps you to become hypocaloric very easily

1:54:25.580 --> 1:54:28.340
 because the density of the calories, you know,

1:54:28.340 --> 1:54:31.100
 in a gram of fat versus a gram of carbohydrates or protein

1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:34.400
 is nine versus four for the carbs and protein.

1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:37.060
 So if you're cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis,

1:54:37.060 --> 1:54:38.980
 you're quickly cutting out calories

1:54:38.980 --> 1:54:40.740
 that allows you to get leaner.

1:54:40.740 --> 1:54:42.980
 Well, of course as everything, I mean,

1:54:42.980 --> 1:54:45.060
 if a little is good, then a lot is better.

1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:48.380
 So I would cut all of them out or almost all of them.

1:54:48.380 --> 1:54:52.140
 And at the age of 22, 21,

1:54:52.140 --> 1:54:55.700
 I'm like standing at a stop up at University of Connecticut

1:54:55.700 --> 1:54:58.620
 waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus.

1:54:58.620 --> 1:55:00.640
 And I couldn't even open my eyes

1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:02.860
 because the light was blinding to me.

1:55:02.860 --> 1:55:05.100
 It was normal sunlight, it was blinding to me.

1:55:05.100 --> 1:55:08.400
 The photosensitivity I had, you know, learning later on

1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:10.940
 after a few more courses that I took there in biology,

1:55:10.940 --> 1:55:15.180
 you know, how, you know, necessary fat was

1:55:15.180 --> 1:55:18.860
 for the development of healthy, you know, cells.

1:55:18.860 --> 1:55:21.780
 I realized what was going on.

1:55:21.780 --> 1:55:23.580
 Then not to make other stuff, skin was bad,

1:55:23.580 --> 1:55:25.200
 hair was falling out, all kinds of stuff.

1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:30.200
 So I think that the approach to decreasing fat,

1:55:31.900 --> 1:55:33.700
 so it's not excessive, you know, because again,

1:55:33.700 --> 1:55:36.060
 how calorically dense it could be in having lower sugar.

1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:38.260
 I don't, I'm a firm believer in sugar

1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:41.520
 is really pretty toxic and something that we would all

1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:43.920
 do better getting rid of a lot of it.

1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:48.400
 That is the best approach for, I believe, again,

1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:52.240
 in my opinion, personally, for the overall big picture,

1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:55.800
 because though the people can take exclusionary approaches

1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:59.240
 to nutrition and taking carbs out or, you know,

1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:02.320
 eating only fats and proteins, or again,

1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:03.760
 I'm not saying it doesn't work for you.

1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:05.720
 And if it's the first thing that actually allowed you

1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:07.320
 to gain control of your nutrition to the point

1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:09.880
 where you actually saw results and got to a healthier weight

1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:11.760
 then I always say, then do it, then do it,

1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:14.000
 but just make sure it's something you can do forever

1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.980
 and doesn't bring upon other repercussions.

1:56:16.980 --> 1:56:21.880
 But I think that non-exclusionary approaches to diets

1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:25.760
 are the most sustainable for the rest of your life.

1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:27.360
 And when I, and all I'm interested in

1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:29.520
 from a nutrition standpoint is something that's sustainable.

1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:30.760
 So when I preach what I preach,

1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:35.680
 I've been doing this since I was 15, 14, you know,

1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:37.640
 people say like, how's he get so ripped?

1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:40.100
 How's he get, I have been doing this for four,

1:56:40.100 --> 1:56:42.720
 since for how many years, 30, 30 years?

1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:44.080
 30 and clean, low sugar.

1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:46.880
 Yeah, 30 years, you know, and in the beginning,

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:50.420
 it was a slow shift I had to make where I was like,

1:56:50.420 --> 1:56:53.180
 I went from the worst diet in the whole world.

1:56:53.180 --> 1:56:56.080
 I was, even when I was 14 years old,

1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:58.720
 my breakfast was, I talked about this so many times,

1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:01.360
 but like enemins, I would eat enemins, you know, donuts.

1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:03.160
 And those long road.

1:57:03.160 --> 1:57:06.840
 Yeah, they even took the whole out of the donut.

1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:08.640
 Yeah, exactly.

1:57:08.640 --> 1:57:11.800
 Why would you, why would you delete the middle of the donut?

1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:14.800
 You know, the crumb donut there, you know,

1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:15.640
 I would eat donut donuts.

1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:17.480
 I can taste it in my, I don't like sugar very much,

1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:19.800
 but over the years I've lost my appetite for sugar.

1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:20.640
 Right.

1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:21.480
 But as you talk about the enemins donuts,

1:57:21.480 --> 1:57:24.560
 I can literally smell and taste the frosting.

1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:25.840
 And to me now it's disgusting,

1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.760
 but back then it might've been appetizing.

1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:29.560
 You would probably have like really good information

1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:33.640
 on this, but like my ability to actually remember,

1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:37.760
 and they've said smell is very evoking of memories, right?

1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:39.960
 So there's a, smell is unlike the other senses

1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:41.760
 because there's a direct line,

1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:43.720
 literally from our sense of smell

1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:44.960
 to the memory centers of the brain.

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:46.880
 It doesn't have to go through any intermediate stations.

1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:51.160
 Okay, so, you know, my ability to actually recall

1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:54.260
 exact taste of all the stuff that I used to love

1:57:54.260 --> 1:57:59.260
 is enough to satisfy me to not engage in those things now.

1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:00.440
 As crazy as that is, I like,

1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:03.040
 I almost get my fill through remembering

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:05.380
 because of these strong senses of memory

1:58:05.380 --> 1:58:07.500
 of what it was like is, oh, that used to taste so good.

1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:08.760
 Okay, that's good, I had it.

1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:10.880
 Fantastic, well, that's,

1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:13.600
 we know the neuromodulator there, that's dopamine.

1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:15.760
 Your ability to get the dopamine release

1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:17.440
 from the thought of something.

1:58:17.440 --> 1:58:20.280
 Most people, when they get that dopamine release,

1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:24.080
 it causes a triggering of the desire for more, right?

1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:25.640
 People think of dopamine as pleasure.

1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:27.600
 Dopamine, there's a book, great book

1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:28.720
 called The Molecule of More.

1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:31.260
 I didn't write the book unfortunately, but someone else did.

1:58:31.260 --> 1:58:34.260
 And it's a great book and it's really about how dopamine,

1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:37.000
 we think it's about pleasure, but it establishes craving.

1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:38.520
 So you're able to satisfy that.

1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:40.400
 And it's a very adaptive thing for you

1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:42.880
 because you are indeed very lean

1:58:42.880 --> 1:58:45.280
 and that's one of your kind of hallmark things.

1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:48.200
 And as a professional who does this in the public space,

1:58:48.200 --> 1:58:49.920
 that's important when people are out there

1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:51.680
 talking about getting lean and you look at them

1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:55.760
 and you're like, maybe you need to do the protocols.

1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:57.520
 It's a huge advantage, but yeah,

1:58:57.520 --> 1:59:01.520
 I think that it sounds like you've cultivated practices

1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:03.280
 around avoiding certain things.

1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:07.160
 Yes, yeah, I mean, but not avoiding certain things

1:59:07.160 --> 1:59:12.000
 that I think are easily avoided if you realize that there,

1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:13.440
 I mean, I think that we have enough science

1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:14.920
 and literature out there to prove

1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:17.560
 that the altered path is a better path.

1:59:17.560 --> 1:59:18.760
 You know what I mean?

1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:20.960
 Like, I feel like if I was just doing it

1:59:20.960 --> 1:59:22.300
 because I wanted to be lean,

1:59:22.300 --> 1:59:25.800
 I'm not quite sure it would have held for so long.

1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:29.440
 And we have a guest whose episode has been recorded

1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:32.300
 for this podcast who runs an eating disorder clinic

1:59:32.300 --> 1:59:34.840
 at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School,

1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:37.480
 studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD,

1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:39.880
 and he will go on record, and obesity,

1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:41.040
 and he will go on record saying

1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:45.040
 that these very highly palatable processed high sugar foods

1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:46.880
 of the sort that we're talking about,

1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:52.120
 donuts and so forth, that they are actually dangerous, right?

1:59:52.120 --> 1:59:54.200
 That there are elements of the way

1:59:54.200 --> 1:59:57.000
 that they engage neural circuitry, he's a neurosurgeon,

1:59:57.000 --> 2:00:00.120
 that reshape the brain in dangerous ways.

2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:01.240
 And those are his words and-

2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:03.520
 Yeah, tank enemins, for sure.

2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:04.720
 Yeah, and it's not just enemins.

2:00:04.720 --> 2:00:07.520
 I mean, I think not just enemins, right?

2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:09.420
 Yeah, they're coming after us with what?

2:00:09.420 --> 2:00:10.260
 With donuts.

2:00:10.260 --> 2:00:11.080
 Exactly.

2:00:11.080 --> 2:00:12.840
 Yeah, they can't catch us.

2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:13.680
 True, true.

2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:18.800
 In any case, so in terms of what you do eat,

2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:21.520
 how do you structure that in terms of

2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:22.860
 when you look down at a plate,

2:00:22.860 --> 2:00:24.680
 you've done these, described this before,

2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:26.920
 but I think it's just a beautifully simple description

2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:27.760
 because I think a lot of people

2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:29.760
 don't want to do calorie counting and all this.

2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:34.760
 And how should people think about what to eat?

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:37.760
 So, yeah, I have what I call a plate method

2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:40.600
 and it's just simple because it works for me.

2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:45.200
 And again, if you're struggling with real eating issues,

2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:49.320
 these mechanisms become admittedly less effective

2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:50.620
 because you're having,

2:00:50.620 --> 2:00:52.000
 maybe you have emotionally triggered eating

2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:53.760
 and you can't stop at one plate.

2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:55.740
 I mean, you can get the plate right,

2:00:55.740 --> 2:00:57.480
 but if the portions are out of control-

2:00:57.480 --> 2:00:58.320
 Plate.

2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:00.720
 The plate has a dimensionality of height.

2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:02.880
 Or multiple plates, like second and third.

2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:03.720
 Or plate.

2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:04.880
 Right, or plate, right.

2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:07.120
 Then all these things can be challenged.

2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:10.920
 But what I say is, when you have your plate,

2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:15.700
 then you just simply look at it as like a clock, right?

2:01:15.700 --> 2:01:19.760
 And if you just make a nine 20 on the clock,

2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:22.120
 so one arm goes over to the nine

2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:24.240
 and one of the arms goes over to 20,

2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:25.760
 well then you're basically,

2:01:25.760 --> 2:01:29.320
 you're gonna take the second largest portion of that

2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:31.800
 because you're gonna make a line towards 12 o'clock too.

2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:33.960
 And the largest portion is gonna be

2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:35.160
 your fiber's carbohydrates.

2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:38.640
 So that's the green vegetables, right?

2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:41.640
 So whether it be broccoli or Brussels sprouts or asparagus,

2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:45.880
 or pick your favorites.

2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:47.440
 Those are the ones that give us

2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:48.960
 a lot of the micronutrients we need.

2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:50.960
 They're the ones that are generally

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:53.000
 accepted as more healthy.

2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:54.840
 And they're also gonna provide the fiber

2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:56.360
 that's gonna be both beneficial

2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:58.520
 in terms of its impact on insulin

2:01:58.520 --> 2:02:01.240
 and also just through filling you up, right?

2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:04.600
 And then I take the next largest portion of that

2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:06.720
 and I devote that towards protein.

2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:07.800
 And I think it's really important,

2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:10.080
 especially for anybody active.

2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:11.160
 The more active you are,

2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:13.200
 the more you embark on trying to build muscle,

2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:15.020
 you're gonna need to have protein every meal.

2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:15.920
 So I have that.

2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:19.160
 And again, we're talking cleaner sources of protein,

2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:22.680
 but you'll never find like boiled chicken on my plate.

2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:25.760
 Like I ditched those days when I was 16 or 15 or 16.

2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:28.480
 Like I realized after reading those bodybuilding magazines

2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:31.240
 that maybe the low fat thing stuck for too long,

2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:33.760
 but the, or the no fat thing stuck for too long,

2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.420
 but the boiled chicken and a steamed broccoli thing,

2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:39.440
 that ended quickly for me.

2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:41.420
 Cause I really, I'm not gonna eat this forever.

2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:44.320
 So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken,

2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:48.280
 but it will be cooked in a way that's like,

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:50.800
 it's got maybe some sauce on it or it's got some,

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:53.280
 maybe it's tomato sauce, anything to just make it

2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:54.620
 a little bit more palatable and interesting

2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:56.520
 without blowing the value of the meal.

2:02:56.520 --> 2:02:58.320
 And then that last portion is where I put

2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:00.040
 my starchy carbohydrates.

2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:01.680
 And again, that's the part that some people will say,

2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:03.360
 exclude them entirely cause they're not healthy

2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:04.400
 or they don't work for you,

2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:06.880
 or they're not beneficial long-term.

2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:08.920
 For me, it's been a godsend.

2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:11.540
 And I do think I'm like most people,

2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:13.780
 my body craves those carbohydrates.

2:03:13.780 --> 2:03:17.360
 I choose things like sweet potatoes, which is my favorite,

2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:21.760
 or I'll have rice or I'll have pasta, I'm Italian.

2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:24.600
 So I like pasta and like, I will have those things.

2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:25.520
 I'm not excluding them,

2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:26.920
 but I don't put them in the portions

2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:28.640
 that you would generally find.

2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:30.520
 You know, my wife and I will go out

2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:32.040
 and we'll go to the restaurant sometimes,

2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:34.240
 like because we travel quite a bit,

2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:36.280
 or used to at least with baseball too.

2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:38.080
 There's a cheesecake factory everywhere you went.

2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:39.840
 And I love cheesecake factory,

2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:42.760
 but like the way they structure meals is,

2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:44.960
 it's all rice on the bottom

2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:46.240
 and a little bit of chicken on top.

2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:48.560
 And I mean, it's a plate full of rice

2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:50.800
 that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way.

2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:53.200
 I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate

2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:55.120
 to the starchy carbohydrate.

2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:57.400
 And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility

2:03:57.400 --> 2:03:58.640
 in terms of portion control,

2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:01.040
 because those are the foods, again,

2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:05.320
 probably dopamine driven that are most easily overeaten.

2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:07.040
 I always ask the question,

2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:09.560
 how was the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal?

2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:11.980
 Like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three,

2:04:11.980 --> 2:04:14.640
 but you could eat a whole hell of a lot of carbohydrates,

2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:15.560
 starchy carbohydrates,

2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:18.120
 because they're just so satisfying.

2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:19.680
 And I think those triggers, as you said,

2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:21.900
 the want more, like that's what happens, right?

2:04:21.900 --> 2:04:25.340
 You just keep, even when you're feeling full, you want more.

2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:27.440
 And that's the biggest danger to carbohydrates.

2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:31.180
 So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them,

2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:33.180
 then you can still enjoy them.

2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:37.080
 If you can't develop that discipline for whatever reason,

2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:38.520
 then maybe they do become something

2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:39.920
 that you have to work yourself around

2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:41.240
 or adopt a different eating style.

2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:43.440
 And as I said, I'm never to the point

2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:45.880
 where I'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach.

2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:48.080
 I'm always trying to say, this is how I do it

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:49.520
 and I'm a believer in it,

2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:51.800
 just like everyone else is a believer in their method.

2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:55.040
 But I'm open to the idea that something that works for you

2:04:55.040 --> 2:04:59.260
 and gets you to a healthier weight and a sustainability,

2:04:59.260 --> 2:05:00.760
 like that is good.

2:05:00.760 --> 2:05:01.720
 That's good for me.

2:05:01.720 --> 2:05:04.880
 Provided it doesn't introduce other issues.

2:05:04.880 --> 2:05:06.640
 Yeah, something one can do consistently.

2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:10.180
 That's something I picked up from you over the years.

2:05:10.180 --> 2:05:11.280
 What can you do consistently?

2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:14.920
 And for me, that also meant when and how can I eat?

2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:16.320
 What can I eat consistently

2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:18.420
 that will also allow me to be alert after lunch

2:05:18.420 --> 2:05:21.760
 so I can actually get some work done or eat?

2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:23.240
 I like to train fasted in the morning,

2:05:23.240 --> 2:05:24.640
 but I don't do any long-term fasting.

2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:28.240
 It just so happens that I'm fine doing water and caffeine

2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:30.200
 in the morning and training in the morning,

2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:32.280
 and then I eat my first meal afterwards.

2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:34.000
 But I get carbohydrates at night,

2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:35.760
 so my glycogen is restored.

2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:37.720
 I think carbohydrates are wonderful.

2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:39.320
 I just don't eat them in excess.

2:05:39.320 --> 2:05:42.000
 So to me, I feel like when,

2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:43.600
 what you describe as a very rational,

2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:45.440
 literally balanced approach,

2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:47.340
 and obviously there will be variations

2:05:47.340 --> 2:05:49.800
 for people who are dealing with obesity or diabetes,

2:05:49.800 --> 2:05:53.600
 or I've got friends that are on the pure carnivore thing.

2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:54.700
 I have friends that are vegan,

2:05:54.700 --> 2:05:57.260
 and it's always impressive to me

2:05:57.260 --> 2:06:01.400
 when somebody can stick to anything consistently,

2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:04.800
 except when they're sticking to just poor behavior.

2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:06.560
 There's nothing impressive about that.

2:06:06.560 --> 2:06:09.440
 Well, I think that that's very helpful

2:06:09.440 --> 2:06:10.500
 because I think there's,

2:06:10.500 --> 2:06:14.360
 for the typical listener of this podcast,

2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:16.440
 the online content that people see,

2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:18.360
 the battles are very confusing.

2:06:18.360 --> 2:06:21.120
 They're distracting because people really think,

2:06:21.120 --> 2:06:22.660
 oh, there's a right way and a wrong way.

2:06:22.660 --> 2:06:23.880
 And it sounds like the way

2:06:23.880 --> 2:06:27.700
 that one can eat consistently over time that's healthy.

2:06:28.700 --> 2:06:30.960
 Certainly fewer processed and sugary foods.

2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:32.640
 I think almost everybody agrees there.

2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:34.400
 Yeah, almost everyone agrees on that, right?

2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:37.800
 So I think it's calorie manipulation

2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:39.140
 through some other method, right?

2:06:39.140 --> 2:06:43.260
 So even intermittent fasting, like you said,

2:06:43.260 --> 2:06:47.040
 that could be, it's for people that are grazers.

2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:49.180
 If you are a grazer and your real problem

2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:51.720
 is portion control over the course of the day,

2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:53.700
 but you can respond to a rule that says,

2:06:53.700 --> 2:06:56.280
 no, you're eating between here and here,

2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:58.080
 that you can obey that rule,

2:06:58.080 --> 2:07:00.160
 well, you're not gonna be able to graze

2:07:00.160 --> 2:07:02.420
 during the times that you might be doing additional damage.

2:07:02.420 --> 2:07:06.600
 So sure, there's other hormonal benefits

2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:08.500
 that people will talk about from that approach,

2:07:08.500 --> 2:07:10.840
 but from a longevity standpoint

2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:12.440
 and habit forming standpoint,

2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:16.240
 if it's fixing the habit that you're breaking too often

2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:17.760
 by eating throughout whenever you feel like

2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:21.800
 you walk by food, it's good and it works.

2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:25.520
 And again, people will tell you,

2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:27.240
 you can probably eat whatever you wanna eat

2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:29.520
 as long as you're eating within that window.

2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.560
 But I think the more responsible people

2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:33.480
 who are practitioners of that will say,

2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:35.680
 no, you still wanna avoid processed sugar

2:07:35.680 --> 2:07:36.960
 and things like that.

2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:38.960
 So, and that's just a mechanism

2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:40.280
 of eating not really a diet, right?

2:07:40.280 --> 2:07:43.040
 But I think that people,

2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:47.400
 I hate to be as basic as it sounds with that,

2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:49.280
 but it's for the exact reason that

2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:52.120
 if it's that 23 hour day phenomenon

2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:55.320
 that it's like you said you're impressed, it is impressive.

2:07:55.320 --> 2:07:58.080
 It's so hard to control all of our behaviors

2:07:58.080 --> 2:07:59.880
 and food being one of the hardest thing,

2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:02.000
 one of the biggest temptations for people.

2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.240
 You gotta learn how to control that for so long

2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:07.120
 and then do it day after day after day.

2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:10.520
 Whatever that mechanism is that works for you

2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:15.240
 is impressive and I'm a believer in it.

2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:17.920
 I think that's how I feel.

2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:19.940
 I just feel like people need to be able to be given

2:08:19.940 --> 2:08:23.440
 some reigns to be able to find what works for them.

2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:25.360
 Well, I love to eat and one of the beauties

2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:28.520
 of weight training is I feel like I can eat plenty

2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:30.840
 for my age and I'm not as lean as you are,

2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:33.360
 but I'm happy with where I'm at.

2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:35.080
 I could always do better.

2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:37.640
 With each year actually I've been getting better

2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:39.100
 probably because I'm eating cleaner,

2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:41.600
 probably because I also have someone to cook for me now.

2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:46.600
 And we like healthy food and so I'm very fortunate.

2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:49.840
 I don't think we have any packaged food in our home.

2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:51.640
 We even started making sauerkraut at home.

2:08:51.640 --> 2:08:53.120
 I don't make it, she makes it.

2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:57.240
 Well, my wife actually, she turned me on to a tip

2:08:57.240 --> 2:08:59.240
 that I actually shared with the whole channel,

2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:03.240
 which was like, you can go to,

2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:06.600
 we have a Stu Leonard's around our big grocery store chain

2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:08.740
 around us and they have a catering department

2:09:08.740 --> 2:09:11.320
 and they're often used for catering big parties

2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:13.720
 and big tubs of grilled chicken,

2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:15.920
 but like really good grilled chicken.

2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:16.940
 Again, not the boiled chicken,

2:09:16.940 --> 2:09:19.000
 but big tubs of sweet potatoes.

2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:22.800
 And we'll get a bunch of those and she'll go over

2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:25.160
 and she'll get them and then she'll sort of arrange them

2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:27.720
 on plates and put the plates in.

2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:29.680
 And like, I'm okay with repetitive eating.

2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:31.420
 I think more people are probably okay

2:09:31.420 --> 2:09:33.000
 with repetitive eating than they think.

2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.040
 I think that when you actually break down,

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:38.040
 how many different breakfast variety,

2:09:38.040 --> 2:09:38.960
 like variations do you have?

2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:40.280
 Three, two?

2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:41.400
 Two or three, maximum.

2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:42.660
 So like, I think when people do,

2:09:42.660 --> 2:09:44.520
 there's more variety for dinner probably,

2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:46.480
 but like even there you probably eat

2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:48.200
 five different types of dinners

2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:50.760
 over the course of a week or a month.

2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:54.800
 Well, if you have that ability to identify the things

2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:56.960
 that you like, and again, no plan is gonna work

2:09:56.960 --> 2:09:58.120
 if you're eating stuff you don't like.

2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:00.280
 It's not gonna work forever, nothing will.

2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:01.920
 You have to really enjoy what you're eating.

2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:05.960
 As long as these variations of this meal

2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:08.040
 are something that you really enjoy

2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:10.740
 and there are limited versions of them,

2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:13.720
 the reproducibility of that is simple.

2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:16.020
 It will take some time, but if you're fortunate enough

2:10:16.020 --> 2:10:18.400
 in our case to have somebody who can prepare it for you,

2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:20.640
 now that's even part out of the equation.

2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:23.540
 And it's like, it just makes it very simple.

2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:27.120
 But I do think when you tally up all the costs

2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:32.120
 of medical care that are spiked by having poor nutrition,

2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:36.040
 and you then offset that by what it might cost you

2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:39.560
 to invest in a faster strategy like this catering trick

2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:42.600
 or whatever it might be, you'd be best off figuring out

2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:44.660
 a way to maybe reallocate some of your money

2:10:44.660 --> 2:10:47.200
 to preparing this because you know how important it is

2:10:47.200 --> 2:10:49.280
 to your long-term health and longevity.

2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:52.360
 If you can figure out your nutrition issues,

2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:53.800
 if everyone listening to this podcast

2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:55.960
 can figure out their nutrition issues,

2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:57.480
 this whole world will be different.

2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:00.340
 That is like one of the largest sources of disease

2:11:00.340 --> 2:11:02.140
 and pain and discomfort

2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:04.160
 because people really struggle with nutrition.

2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:06.080
 Yeah, and it's a huge problem.

2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:09.520
 I mean, the obesity, it is an epidemic in this country.

2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:11.160
 It's very, very serious.

2:11:11.160 --> 2:11:13.100
 Also, a lot of highly processed foods

2:11:13.100 --> 2:11:15.520
 are more expensive than healthier foods.

2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:17.160
 When you really break it down,

2:11:18.020 --> 2:11:21.120
 even the better sourced high quality foods

2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:25.560
 are right there on par less than the processed foods,

2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:26.400
 for sure.

2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:31.540
 I have a couple other questions as it relates to training

2:11:31.540 --> 2:11:34.020
 because I think that one thing

2:11:34.020 --> 2:11:36.760
 that a lot of people wonder about,

2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:39.760
 and maybe we could do this in kind of a true-false method

2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:42.840
 just to get through some of these.

2:11:42.840 --> 2:11:44.480
 50-50, I'll get it right at least.

2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:45.320
 Exactly.

2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:48.280
 Men and women should train differently?

2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:51.280
 The science of it will say false.

2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:54.680
 And again, not to generalize,

2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:57.420
 but kind of the point you touched on earlier today,

2:11:57.420 --> 2:12:02.420
 I do find that casually interested women in training

2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:05.940
 will migrate more towards certain types of fitness,

2:12:05.940 --> 2:12:08.420
 like kickboxing, like dancing,

2:12:08.420 --> 2:12:10.680
 like low-rest circuit type.

2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:11.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:12.640
 And I think, again,

2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:16.000
 whatever it is that you're going to engage in regularly

2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:17.340
 is what you should do.

2:12:17.340 --> 2:12:18.480
 Physiologically, no.

2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:20.920
 And I think if we can get more women

2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:23.480
 to feel more comfortable in the gym,

2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:25.080
 performing the same exercises

2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:29.040
 and receiving the same strength training benefits

2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:30.480
 and working on progressive overload,

2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:32.320
 and like, yeah, we've hit the holy grail.

2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:35.840
 But I think that it's a big bridge

2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:37.320
 that has to be gapped still

2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:41.000
 because there's just some reality to,

2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.360
 listen, there are very,

2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:45.960
 my wife is a perfect example of this,

2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:49.240
 living a very complicated, busy life.

2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:51.580
 We have two young boys, they're twins,

2:12:51.580 --> 2:12:55.400
 and her attention and focus is there.

2:12:55.400 --> 2:12:58.680
 And it's like, she doesn't do this for a living like I do.

2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:02.040
 And if she can get a decent workout in, she's happy,

2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:05.520
 but she's not necessarily working on her deadlift PR.

2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:08.240
 And so I think that that would help her

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:10.680
 and serve her in the longterm

2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:13.920
 to work on increasing her PRs and different lifts

2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:15.460
 and building her strength progressively.

2:13:15.460 --> 2:13:18.280
 But in her life right now,

2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:19.680
 it's not necessarily in the cards

2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:21.480
 to have the time to focus on that.

2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:24.440
 So would you then discourage this other thing

2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:25.920
 that she might find interesting?

2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:30.400
 Like some boxing, there was a little,

2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:31.240
 I don't remember the brand,

2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:34.280
 but like one of those punchable boxing standup things,

2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:35.960
 and she enjoys it.

2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:40.920
 And anything to get you moving is going to be preferable,

2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:43.040
 but I don't think that necessarily physiologically

2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:44.680
 there's a difference.

2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:46.300
 You started weight training pretty young.

2:13:46.300 --> 2:13:50.040
 Yeah, I messed around with my brother

2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:51.520
 because he was older, he was four years older.

2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:52.840
 So I was kind of messing around with weights,

2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:55.160
 probably 12 or 13 with a five pound dumbbell.

2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:57.360
 Okay, yeah, you hear that young kids

2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:58.680
 shouldn't work out with the weights.

2:13:58.680 --> 2:14:00.560
 I don't know what the going standard is now.

2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:02.480
 They say, shuts down long bone growth

2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:05.840
 or growth plates, this sort of thing.

2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:08.200
 You've got two young boys, adorable kids, by the way.

2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:11.640
 Yeah, one of the things that is very heartwarming

2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:13.440
 is to see that you're in great shape,

2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:15.480
 you're extremely bright, you know your craft,

2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:17.960
 you love your craft, you work with Jesse,

2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:22.160
 who we'll talk about as well, which is great.

2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:25.080
 There's a camaraderie there, having great teammates

2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:27.320
 as part of a business or to work out with

2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:28.440
 is just makes life better.

2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:31.020
 Let's just be honest, I'm grateful to have great teammates

2:14:31.020 --> 2:14:33.360
 for the podcast and my lab, of course, as well.

2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:38.680
 But to see your boys and your dogs and the whole picture,

2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:42.660
 I'm sure it has a lot of contours and complexity

2:14:42.660 --> 2:14:44.480
 that we don't know about and shouldn't know about,

2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:45.820
 but it's a beautiful picture.

2:14:45.820 --> 2:14:48.840
 And will they weight train?

2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:51.160
 I've seen the videos of one or both of them

2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:52.000
 hanging from the box.

2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.280
 These kids are naturals, I'm telling you that.

2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:55.640
 I wonder where they get it from.

2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:58.500
 I don't even encourage it.

2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:00.120
 I'm not going to be the dad who's sitting there saying,

2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:01.680
 let's go, son.

2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:02.960
 Yeah, we got our two days here.

2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:04.540
 I'm not going to do that,

2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:07.940
 but they have a natural interest in the gym.

2:15:07.940 --> 2:15:09.780
 They just sometimes like to be out with daddy.

2:15:09.780 --> 2:15:14.000
 So they'll come out there and I, of the two of us,

2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.880
 my wife and I will be the one who has a little bit more

2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:19.080
 of a longer leash to let them explore things.

2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:20.960
 Cause I was a dummy at times too,

2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:23.000
 and figured out best through the mistakes I made.

2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:24.440
 Through injury.

2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:26.600
 In neuroscience, we call that one trial learning.

2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:27.440
 There you go.

2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:29.200
 These guys are going to be masters of one trial learning

2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:33.040
 because they'll go grab the bars of my,

2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:34.800
 the handles of my jammer that's there.

2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:36.240
 Cause it's at a lower level to them

2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:37.320
 and they're swinging around,

2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:38.800
 they're doing pull-ups on it naturally.

2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:40.920
 One coach, nothing from me.

2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:42.480
 One will walk up to a deadlift bar,

2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:43.680
 stand over it naturally.

2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:44.900
 Never saw me do it.

2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:46.000
 Stands over there and just goes,

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:47.800
 ah, he tries to pull it.

2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:50.000
 So there's a, there's a definitely an inclination

2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.940
 to liking the gym and I will fully support that.

2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:54.200
 But of course, you know,

2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:56.180
 body weight will be good for quite a while.

2:15:56.180 --> 2:15:58.320
 So what age do you think is reasonable for kids

2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:01.640
 to start exploring a non-body weight training?

2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:03.840
 I think around 13, you know, I think around 13.

2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:07.640
 Once puberty, I think it's okay to start to, you know,

2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:11.280
 cause there's so much I even say for people

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:13.680
 that are like later in age who are just starting out,

2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:14.860
 learn with your own body weight first.

2:16:14.860 --> 2:16:16.560
 There's plenty of resistance to be had

2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:18.680
 by learning how to command your body in space.

2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:21.640
 So if you have never trained before,

2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:23.480
 you're going to get very stimulated

2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:25.400
 by doing lunging and reverse lunging,

2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:26.920
 even learning some of the proprioception

2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:28.480
 around movement through space.

2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:29.960
 Pull-ups, chin-ups, pull-ups and chin-ups

2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:31.720
 are challenging for even people that have had

2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:33.720
 20, 30 years of experience in the gym.

2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:37.240
 So there's a lot of stimulus to be had by body weight

2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:40.760
 and jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells

2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:42.220
 is actually doing yourself a disservice.

2:16:42.220 --> 2:16:44.960
 You can learn better command of your body in space

2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:48.120
 so that when you go back to the bigger lifts,

2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:49.660
 you're going to have an easier time

2:16:49.660 --> 2:16:51.160
 sort of progressively loading them

2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:52.920
 and building up that foundation of strength.

2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:54.340
 I'm not saying that you have to become

2:16:54.340 --> 2:16:56.040
 a master calisthenics athlete

2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:57.200
 before you can touch a barbell.

2:16:57.200 --> 2:16:58.160
 That's not even true.

2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:00.240
 I'm just saying there's so much capacity.

2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:01.520
 Kids are going to be doing this anyway.

2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:03.720
 And really just, if you look at general play,

2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:05.560
 they are jumping, they are lunging,

2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:07.320
 they are climbing, they are pulling.

2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:08.780
 Like that's what they do.

2:17:08.780 --> 2:17:12.620
 So why, I don't know where the avoidance

2:17:12.620 --> 2:17:15.600
 of like structured training is for younger kids.

2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:17.240
 Again, provided they're using body weight

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:21.480
 and maybe less ballistic movements or something like that.

2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:25.060
 Things that are certainly overloaded movements.

2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:26.860
 I think we should encourage kids to do more.

2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:31.140
 There's a lot of obesity in kids on the rise also.

2:17:31.140 --> 2:17:34.160
 And that is incredibly disconcerting to me.

2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:36.760
 So I think, and I hope it doesn't come from

2:17:36.760 --> 2:17:38.080
 the advice of some that say,

2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:40.240
 well, wait until you're older to start doing something.

2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:42.200
 Like that's a way worse trade off

2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:45.320
 than engaging in something smart now.

2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:47.600
 We used to get kicked out of the house when we were kids.

2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:49.200
 My mom would kick us out.

2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:52.280
 I had a huge pack of boys that lived on my street,

2:17:52.280 --> 2:17:54.120
 but we'd get kicked out side.

2:17:54.120 --> 2:17:57.640
 Like literally you're not allowed in the, no television.

2:17:57.640 --> 2:17:59.160
 There were video games of course,

2:17:59.160 --> 2:18:00.560
 but we were kicked out of the house.

2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:01.480
 We had to go play.

2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:02.740
 For us it was skateboarding, soccer,

2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:04.680
 and then we'd find our trouble.

2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:09.680
 But so post-training nutrition, we're the same age.

2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:14.080
 Years ago, I was sort of neurotic about the idea

2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:16.680
 that I had to ingest a certain amount of carbohydrates

2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:18.360
 and proteins within two hours.

2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:20.540
 Then it was 90 minutes of training.

2:18:20.540 --> 2:18:22.620
 I confess I get, if I train hard,

2:18:22.620 --> 2:18:23.920
 so I'm talking about the resistance training,

2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:26.360
 not the running, but the resistance training,

2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:30.480
 you know, 60 to 90 minutes later, I'm really hungry.

2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:32.480
 But there've been days when I just skip

2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:35.160
 and then the hunger passes and then later I eat more.

2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:36.560
 I might eat twice as much later.

2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:39.080
 You know, that's just the way sometimes schedules go.

2:18:39.080 --> 2:18:43.080
 But what are your thoughts in terms of the nutrition science,

2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:47.400
 the training related effects of the post-training meal?

2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:50.080
 Is it something that you try to get?

2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:50.920
 Is it something that you think

2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:52.920
 people should pay attention to?

2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:56.000
 So that science has actually probably been the one

2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.360
 that's changed the most in my lifetime, honestly,

2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:00.680
 because I, again, we're the same age

2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:04.480
 and I was falling for the same trap,

2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:08.080
 you know, where I would really be focused on,

2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:10.240
 like I'm risking speeding tickets,

2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:12.360
 driving home from the gym to make sure

2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:13.880
 I got an anabolic window.

2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:15.260
 You know, like I did all that.

2:19:15.260 --> 2:19:16.100
 I really did.

2:19:16.100 --> 2:19:19.400
 You know, but thankfully that's been sort of debunked

2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:22.380
 and your body isn't just rushing through, you know,

2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:24.200
 these certain periods of time to utilize

2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:25.080
 the nutrients in our body,

2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:26.360
 but are able to partition them

2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:29.060
 and use them over a long, much greater duration.

2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:31.720
 Up to now they're saying, you know, three to four hours

2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:33.640
 after training, five hours after training,

2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:37.220
 you can still see the benefits of replenishment.

2:19:37.220 --> 2:19:38.760
 A lot of that is just, you know,

2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:40.920
 I think there's a consistency element to it

2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:46.800
 that just utilizing a post-workout window

2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:48.480
 or a post-workout meal,

2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:51.080
 even if it's within two hours or one hour,

2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:53.280
 is just integrating the habit of saying,

2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:55.680
 listen, I just did this activity

2:19:55.680 --> 2:19:58.060
 and now I want to replenish some of what I lost,

2:19:58.060 --> 2:20:00.560
 the energy that I used to perform,

2:20:00.560 --> 2:20:02.400
 you know, the exercises that I did.

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:04.480
 And just getting into the routine,

2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:08.300
 knowing that the engine is ultimately fed

2:20:08.300 --> 2:20:09.600
 by what we put in it.

2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:14.040
 And the concept of replenishing the fuel lost

2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:16.000
 is still a concept that I think, again,

2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:18.400
 different in mechanism, but still important

2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:20.560
 in terms of fueling the overall performance.

2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:24.480
 So, you know, the pre-workout period of time

2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:28.080
 gives us a chance to actually have a longer window

2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:31.520
 because if those nutrients are obtained pre-workout,

2:20:31.520 --> 2:20:34.680
 it's not like they're gone in that hour that you've trained.

2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:36.600
 They're still there and available for your body to use.

2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:38.440
 So, you know, I think it's important

2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:40.480
 to get one of the two, you know, right?

2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:42.480
 Or at least make sure you're consistently

2:20:43.840 --> 2:20:45.340
 having one or the two,

2:20:45.340 --> 2:20:48.320
 or you might risk going through all these periods

2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:51.680
 of having no nutrition to support your efforts.

2:20:51.680 --> 2:20:53.440
 Not only will your workouts potentially suffer

2:20:53.440 --> 2:20:54.540
 in terms of the output,

2:20:54.540 --> 2:20:56.680
 but then you're also not providing your body

2:20:56.680 --> 2:21:01.320
 any ability to capitalize on an opportunity to feed it

2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:02.840
 and refuel and recover.

2:21:02.840 --> 2:21:07.840
 So, I'm not very dogmatic about what specifically

2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:11.440
 to eat pre or post, you know, workout,

2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:13.920
 but I do think you should have protein

2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:15.680
 surrounding your training,

2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:18.000
 whether that be ahead of time or after.

2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:21.040
 Protein could be a little bit hard to digest

2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:21.880
 for some people.

2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:23.440
 So, if you do that pre-workout

2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:25.480
 and then you're finding your workouts slogging

2:21:25.480 --> 2:21:26.960
 because you don't feel good,

2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:29.120
 then suddenly you put that after your meal.

2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:32.400
 But this whole concept of the urgency of time

2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:34.680
 has thankfully been removed

2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:37.560
 and we can just learn to eat a little bit more,

2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:40.960
 you know, responsibly and drive more responsibly

2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:43.260
 so we're not, you know, trying to rush home from the gym

2:21:43.260 --> 2:21:44.920
 and risk, you know, killing people on the way.

2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:47.120
 You know, I think it's,

2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:49.200
 but I think it's great because I think that

2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:51.480
 that was something that it just showcases a belief

2:21:51.480 --> 2:21:53.760
 that people had for so long

2:21:53.760 --> 2:21:56.800
 that has since been proven to be not that important.

2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:00.320
 And there's a tip of the cap towards research in a good way

2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:02.040
 where it's like, all right, I think we could all agree

2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:04.680
 that this isn't necessarily true anymore.

2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:08.040
 And look at yourself and say,

2:22:08.040 --> 2:22:10.560
 oh my God, I did that so often.

2:22:10.560 --> 2:22:12.480
 Like I bit that one hook, line and sinker.

2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:15.720
 But then realize, okay, we could always make a change

2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:17.160
 and the good thing about nutrition is

2:22:17.160 --> 2:22:19.720
 those changes can happen the very next time you go to eat,

2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:21.560
 you know, and you'll start to see the benefits of that.

2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:26.560
 So I'm not a big believer in that strict approach

2:22:26.640 --> 2:22:29.320
 to pre or post workout.

2:22:29.320 --> 2:22:32.080
 I mean, even as far as pre-workout supplements,

2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:34.200
 a lot of people don't take them.

2:22:34.200 --> 2:22:35.360
 A lot of people don't like them.

2:22:35.360 --> 2:22:36.200
 They don't take them.

2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:38.960
 They don't like, they're not necessarily even being used

2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:42.160
 as the new nutritive side of the pre-workout.

2:22:42.160 --> 2:22:45.000
 They're just more used to fuel the workout.

2:22:46.220 --> 2:22:49.120
 For me, it's water and some form of caffeine.

2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:51.440
 Yeah, I mean, it's whatever, you know, again,

2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:52.360
 I think it's important.

2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:53.200
 I do think it's important

2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:55.040
 to maintain a high level of output.

2:22:55.040 --> 2:22:59.120
 So if your pre-workout nutrition requires a stimulant

2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:00.240
 in order to help you do that,

2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:03.680
 or if your pre-workout nutrition is causing you

2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:04.980
 to have a harder time to train

2:23:04.980 --> 2:23:07.760
 because you're feeling full or stomachache

2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:09.680
 or something else, then that's not achieving

2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:10.520
 what you're trying to do.

2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:12.560
 The ultimate goal is to still be able to perform

2:23:12.560 --> 2:23:13.580
 at the highest level.

2:23:13.580 --> 2:23:15.600
 So whatever your nutrition is required

2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:17.160
 to allow you to still do that,

2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:18.840
 that is probably the most important factor

2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:19.760
 of all of it.

2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:20.600
 Great.

2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:22.480
 I love the very clear and rational approach.

2:23:22.480 --> 2:23:24.840
 Don't ingest anything right before your workout

2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:27.920
 or near your workout that's going to make your workout worse.

2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:28.760
 So, I mean, even-

2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:30.760
 And it's so simple and yet you don't hear this

2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:31.600
 because I think people will think,

2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.300
 oh, they must have a pre-workout.

2:23:33.300 --> 2:23:34.620
 They must have a post-workout.

2:23:34.620 --> 2:23:36.440
 Again, like even if there are the benefits

2:23:36.440 --> 2:23:40.080
 that are to be had from whatever's being suggested

2:23:40.080 --> 2:23:41.820
 is going to be easily offset by the fact

2:23:41.820 --> 2:23:43.480
 that you can't perform at an output

2:23:43.480 --> 2:23:46.160
 capable of driving any change.

2:23:46.160 --> 2:23:48.600
 So that would pretty much negate the fact

2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:51.320
 that you're not outweighing those benefits

2:23:51.320 --> 2:23:53.840
 of whatever nutritive approach you took

2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:55.400
 and it's struggling through your workout.

2:23:55.400 --> 2:23:58.280
 Yeah, for me, the best pre-workout is a good night's sleep,

2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:00.360
 hydration, caffeine, music.

2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:01.480
 Yeah, there you go.

2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:03.400
 I mean, it's pretty simple formula.

2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:04.240
 It works.

2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:06.360
 And then post-workout, I do find I get quite hungry

2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:08.200
 and want to eat quite a bit more and-

2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:09.440
 Well, that's a natural response.

2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:11.920
 The body's going to, and most people want to do that

2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:13.160
 and I think it should be fed.

2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:17.240
 I work out as, again, a lot of my postings on Instagram

2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:20.000
 will happen at 10 o'clock at night, 10.30 at night,

2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:21.760
 11 at night, because I am actually training there

2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:23.060
 and that's where I'm taking those little breaks

2:24:23.060 --> 2:24:25.440
 in between sets to actually film or post something.

2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:27.440
 But like, I then go inside, I eat dinner.

2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:29.920
 So I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night.

2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:31.800
 It's not necessarily ideal.

2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:33.880
 I'm not recommending that as a tool for anybody.

2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:35.280
 I think it dispels one thing.

2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:38.360
 I've never been a believer in can eat carbs after six.

2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:40.060
 Yeah, that makes no sense to me.

2:24:40.060 --> 2:24:40.900
 Zero sense.

2:24:40.900 --> 2:24:41.720
 Based on all the new,

2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:44.560
 all the science of metabolism that I've seen.

2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:47.080
 I think as long as you can, sort of like napping.

2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:49.640
 I talked to Matt Walker, one of the great sleep researchers

2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:51.160
 wrote Why We Sleep, et cetera,

2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:53.320
 and has his own podcast about sleep.

2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:55.560
 Tremendous researcher, public communicator about sleep.

2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:58.360
 And he said, naps are fine provided they don't interrupt

2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:00.600
 your ability to sleep well at night.

2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:01.440
 Simple.

2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:03.080
 Some people can sleep from eight to 9 p.m.

2:25:03.080 --> 2:25:04.840
 and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem.

2:25:04.840 --> 2:25:06.840
 Other people, they take a 30 minute nap after lunch

2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:08.160
 and they can't sleep at night.

2:25:08.160 --> 2:25:09.860
 Same thing with, caffeine's a little different

2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:11.900
 because Matt would argue the architecture of sleep

2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:12.920
 can be disrupted, et cetera.

2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:16.480
 But if you can eat dinner late and eat carbohydrates late,

2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:17.820
 I actually need carbohydrates at night

2:25:17.820 --> 2:25:19.400
 in order to be able to sleep.

2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:22.760
 Whenever I've done a low carbohydrate type regimen

2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:24.760
 in the evening, I have a hard time falling asleep.

2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:25.760
 I'm just too alert.

2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:28.480
 And so I eat carbohydrates in the evening

2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:31.840
 to restore glycogen, but also in order to make sure

2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:33.140
 that I can fall asleep.

2:25:33.140 --> 2:25:37.000
 I actually can, again, obviously it's already late at night

2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.560
 by the time I'm done eating, but like I can fall asleep

2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:41.960
 within five, 10 minutes of finishing my meal.

2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:45.600
 Because I do think that they have that same effect on me.

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:49.200
 But I'm never, I'm not bothered by the feeling of fullness.

2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:50.800
 I'm not, I'm not unable to sleep

2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:52.920
 because of the feeling of fullness.

2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:57.480
 But I do like the fact that I feel as if I'm at least

2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:00.140
 replenishing what was lost through my hard training.

2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:02.640
 And I do like to back it up with a dinner.

2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:04.480
 I don't need to eat smaller amounts.

2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:05.960
 Some people can't have that much.

2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:07.740
 I will say after a hard leg workout,

2:26:07.740 --> 2:26:09.320
 I don't have the same appetite that I do

2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:12.000
 after let's say, an upper body workout.

2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:17.000
 It can really disrupt my whole feeling of wellbeing.

2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:19.840
 You want to eat less after you train your legs?

2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:20.680
 I do, yeah.

2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:22.360
 Oh, wow, I'm the opposite.

2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:23.680
 No, because I just feel like I could feel sick

2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:24.800
 to my stomach, you know?

2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:26.240
 You're clearly training harder.

2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:27.080
 I've seen the way you train.

2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:28.400
 You do train very intensely.

2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:29.320
 Yeah. Yeah.

2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:30.400
 Yeah, I think it's important.

2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:32.960
 I mean, I think that, again, it's that trade off

2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:35.000
 between if you're not going to train

2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.080
 for a long period of time,

2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:38.900
 then you're going to want to train harder.

2:26:38.900 --> 2:26:41.120
 And again, I actually feel like contrary

2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:44.160
 to what people might think as you age,

2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:45.960
 you're better off training harder

2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:48.000
 for a shorter period of time.

2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:52.060
 You know, it's always within the realm of safe training.

2:26:52.060 --> 2:26:53.720
 I mean, I think that's what I like to think.

2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:54.800
 That's what I bring to the table.

2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:57.840
 Like an approach that's smarter so I can train harder.

2:26:57.840 --> 2:26:59.760
 You know, like not doing the dumb things I did

2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:01.480
 when I was a kid.

2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:06.280
 And with that trade off, being a harder trainer,

2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:08.740
 I think I get the results that I want

2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:10.280
 because I'm able to really push it

2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:11.480
 and then back off.

2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:16.480
 And again, the meal feels like almost a physiological reward

2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:18.280
 for the hard effort I put in the gym,

2:27:18.280 --> 2:27:20.180
 knowing that I'm also replenishing

2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:22.740
 and setting the stage for the next day

2:27:22.740 --> 2:27:25.240
 to be another successful day of training.

2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:28.520
 Or maybe not, depending on how many times a week I train.

2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:33.520
 But yeah, I think that it's a lot less,

2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:36.320
 I hate to say it, but it's a lot less scientific

2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:38.840
 than we want to make it.

2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:41.780
 And as it seems to be coming back oftentimes,

2:27:41.780 --> 2:27:43.120
 like the thing that works for you

2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:44.560
 is really the most important thing

2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:46.480
 because ultimately getting your ass in there

2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:48.280
 and doing what you do is really the thing

2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:50.280
 that provides the best benefit.

2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:53.200
 Absolutely, and you know, there are many things

2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:55.280
 that I would say are hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere,

2:27:55.280 --> 2:27:58.140
 but one of them is certainly consistency.

2:27:58.140 --> 2:28:00.560
 You make it happen one way or another.

2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:04.300
 Huge, I mean, consistency really is the determinant.

2:28:04.300 --> 2:28:07.620
 And I know that that is the hardest part for people

2:28:07.620 --> 2:28:10.280
 and why people tend to look for the shortcut

2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:11.780
 because consistency is the part

2:28:11.780 --> 2:28:14.360
 that becomes the biggest challenge.

2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:18.480
 But if you could find, listen, if you could find the,

2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:20.600
 I mean, through what I've been trying to encourage here

2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:22.360
 is like, if you could find the nutrition approach,

2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:23.680
 if you could find the training approach,

2:28:23.680 --> 2:28:25.120
 if you could try to find the training split,

2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:27.680
 if you could try, all those things that encourage you

2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:28.560
 to want to go to the gym,

2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:29.840
 like you're locked in at the point

2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:31.280
 where you said you actually look forward

2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:33.320
 to going and doing your workout.

2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:34.160
 I love it.

2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:36.440
 I look forward to, I mean, it's, you know,

2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:39.880
 actually this morning, one of our teammates for the podcast,

2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:41.520
 I got a workout and halfway through,

2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:42.720
 I just turned to him and I said,

2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:44.640
 I'll never figure out why that feels so good,

2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:45.640
 but it feels so good.

2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:46.940
 I just, I really enjoy it.

2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:49.280
 And it lets, and I love to eat and it lets me eat.

2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:51.240
 And I love the way it makes me feel afterward.

2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:53.600
 I don't understand this concept of not enjoying the gym.

2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:54.960
 Cardio is a little different.

2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:58.880
 I always loathe the first 10 or 20 minutes of a jog.

2:28:58.880 --> 2:29:01.840
 I mildly loathe the middle third.

2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:04.080
 And by the end, I think this is the greatest thing ever.

2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:05.240
 Why don't I do it all at a time?

2:29:05.240 --> 2:29:06.480
 And then that feeling evaporates

2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:07.680
 before the next time I do it.

2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:10.040
 Yeah, of course you don't even remember it either.

2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:10.880
 You hit it again.

2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:11.720
 Exactly.

2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:14.520
 Yeah, I think if people could,

2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:17.040
 if we had one gift we could give to everybody,

2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:18.840
 it would be the love of fitness, right?

2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:20.900
 If they could be bestowed the love of fitness,

2:29:20.900 --> 2:29:22.800
 it would change the entire world, you know?

2:29:22.800 --> 2:29:26.740
 But I think when you hear things like this,

2:29:26.740 --> 2:29:28.780
 that like, hey, that will work and that will work too.

2:29:28.780 --> 2:29:30.280
 And that this will work too, you know,

2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:34.880
 rather than the dogmatic one way only approach,

2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:37.520
 which could become discouraging for people.

2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:39.440
 Then I think it becomes a little bit uplifting.

2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:40.680
 Like, well, I've never tried that.

2:29:40.680 --> 2:29:42.680
 I've actually never tried a total body split

2:29:42.680 --> 2:29:44.920
 or I've never tried, you know, that style of eating.

2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:48.340
 Like it becomes encouraging that you might want to explore

2:29:48.340 --> 2:29:50.040
 and then you might finally get locked in and say,

2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:50.880
 I really liked this.

2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:52.200
 And then you're off and running.

2:29:52.200 --> 2:29:56.560
 Let's move what I so enjoy about your content.

2:29:56.560 --> 2:30:00.720
 We would be remiss if we didn't briefly discuss Jesse.

2:30:00.720 --> 2:30:04.060
 One of the great pleasures for me in watching your content

2:30:04.060 --> 2:30:06.960
 and learning from it over the years is that you took on,

2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:09.480
 you decided to mentor somebody, Jesse.

2:30:09.480 --> 2:30:12.160
 And there's some poking fun back and forth

2:30:12.160 --> 2:30:13.860
 between the two of you, which is very amusing.

2:30:13.860 --> 2:30:17.320
 But I have to say, it inspired me to do something early on

2:30:17.320 --> 2:30:19.880
 in developing this podcast as I have a young intern

2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:23.080
 who has helped me with some of the research

2:30:23.080 --> 2:30:24.940
 and he's interested in science.

2:30:24.940 --> 2:30:26.040
 He's about to go off to college,

2:30:26.040 --> 2:30:27.240
 but he also got really into fitness.

2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:29.180
 We would watch the videos of you guys.

2:30:29.180 --> 2:30:32.240
 He was helping me get the Instagram content out early on.

2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:34.600
 And one thing that was just, it's such a pleasure

2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:35.960
 to be able to pass along knowledge.

2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:37.840
 And of course I'm learning from him.

2:30:37.840 --> 2:30:39.200
 This is always the way it works.

2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:42.160
 We learn from teaching and we learn from students.

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:44.200
 But it's been great to see Jesse's progress.

2:30:44.200 --> 2:30:45.040
 It's amazing.

2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:47.760
 I've gotten to meet him in person just now.

2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:51.460
 And he has grown, he's changed physically.

2:30:51.460 --> 2:30:53.620
 And I think that you mentioned a love of fitness.

2:30:53.620 --> 2:30:56.800
 I think that one of the best ways to be consistent

2:30:56.800 --> 2:30:59.360
 is to take on the responsibility of teaching others

2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:01.240
 once one has proficiency in something.

2:31:01.240 --> 2:31:04.000
 So maybe you just tell us a little bit

2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:06.080
 about how that's going, how is Jesse doing

2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:08.760
 and where does he need a little more work?

2:31:08.760 --> 2:31:10.480
 Where is he thriving?

2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:12.080
 I'm impressed by the progress.

2:31:12.080 --> 2:31:13.480
 Well, we have, I mean, physically,

2:31:13.480 --> 2:31:16.000
 we can obviously see the changes,

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:18.340
 the list of things to work on is immense.

2:31:18.340 --> 2:31:20.880
 It's so long for him to continue to improve.

2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:25.100
 But no, actually, in reality, Jesse,

2:31:25.100 --> 2:31:27.000
 the story of Jesse was that I knew Jesse

2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:28.920
 prior to starting even Athlean-X.

2:31:28.920 --> 2:31:30.400
 And as a matter of fact, I think the funny thing

2:31:30.400 --> 2:31:33.520
 is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel

2:31:33.520 --> 2:31:36.700
 was a video that he shot as, I don't know,

2:31:36.700 --> 2:31:38.280
 a 13-year-old or something.

2:31:38.280 --> 2:31:40.060
 And I said, can you just film this for a second?

2:31:40.060 --> 2:31:42.880
 I was over there training members of the family.

2:31:42.880 --> 2:31:47.560
 So he then went off to college, went into film,

2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:50.760
 realized he had much greener pastures at Athlean-X

2:31:50.760 --> 2:31:53.360
 instead of becoming the next Scorsese or something.

2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:55.840
 And he decided to come work with me.

2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:58.200
 And the expectations in the beginning

2:31:58.200 --> 2:32:02.100
 were just to edit videos or just to help

2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:05.400
 with various aspects of my day-to-day

2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:07.720
 that I don't think I was equipped to really handle

2:32:07.720 --> 2:32:08.880
 and grow the business anymore.

2:32:08.880 --> 2:32:13.880
 So then look at, by virtue of being in that environment,

2:32:14.200 --> 2:32:15.040
 there's an interest.

2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:17.040
 I think if I worked in a gym,

2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:18.840
 I might become interested in working out.

2:32:18.840 --> 2:32:20.640
 And though mine is not a commercial gym,

2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:24.780
 it's sitting right behind my office window,

2:32:24.780 --> 2:32:27.480
 there became an interest in wanting to work out a little bit

2:32:27.480 --> 2:32:32.000
 and it wasn't even an intentional experiment

2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:33.480
 to put Jesse there.

2:32:33.480 --> 2:32:36.360
 I just thought that he's a very likable person.

2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:38.360
 He has a very funny personality.

2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:39.800
 He's also the everyman.

2:32:40.920 --> 2:32:45.000
 In some ways, as I'm sure maybe you experience sometimes,

2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:47.600
 I'm the guy that this comes naturally for me

2:32:47.600 --> 2:32:48.760
 is what people will say.

2:32:48.760 --> 2:32:51.040
 This is what you do for a living.

2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:52.800
 There's an element of disconnect

2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:54.840
 in terms of the relatability

2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:56.840
 because I do do this for a living.

2:32:56.840 --> 2:32:57.680
 I can't deny that.

2:32:57.680 --> 2:32:59.360
 I do work with professional athletes

2:32:59.360 --> 2:33:02.280
 so there's a level of interest in this above and beyond.

2:33:02.280 --> 2:33:04.600
 But for him, he's just the kid who wants to train

2:33:04.600 --> 2:33:08.200
 maybe if he rolls out of bed before 11 a.m.

2:33:08.200 --> 2:33:11.100
 and doesn't have a date on Friday night.

2:33:11.100 --> 2:33:13.240
 But that's the guy everybody can relate to.

2:33:13.240 --> 2:33:15.940
 And watching him transform,

2:33:15.940 --> 2:33:18.560
 and I love the fact that even the interest level

2:33:19.880 --> 2:33:21.040
 was up and down.

2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:22.400
 It wasn't consistent for him

2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:24.960
 because he was part interested

2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:26.360
 and then maybe not interested for three months

2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:27.320
 and then interested in that.

2:33:27.320 --> 2:33:29.120
 And I never pushed it on him.

2:33:29.120 --> 2:33:31.440
 Again, this was no orchestrated experiment for me.

2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:33.780
 It was just like, if you want to do this, then do this.

2:33:33.780 --> 2:33:35.540
 And also from a standpoint of like,

2:33:36.760 --> 2:33:39.560
 lending my help or expertise to him,

2:33:39.560 --> 2:33:40.740
 like I said with my son,

2:33:40.740 --> 2:33:42.120
 I'm not going to force it on anybody.

2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:43.280
 I don't want to do that to anybody.

2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:46.560
 I don't think that that's ever going to spark that desire

2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:48.520
 for long-term adoption.

2:33:48.520 --> 2:33:50.680
 So he got more interested.

2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:51.960
 He started to learn more about it.

2:33:51.960 --> 2:33:53.720
 He watches the videos that we're filming.

2:33:53.720 --> 2:33:55.280
 He films the videos that we're filming

2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:56.760
 and he's learning through what I'm saying.

2:33:56.760 --> 2:33:59.920
 He's becoming more of a student of the field.

2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:02.840
 And I have to say his knowledge in the field

2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:05.840
 has grown with the growth of his physique.

2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:08.480
 And he's put into practice some of the things that I say,

2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:10.680
 he's put in practice some things he hears other places

2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:13.600
 and he winds up improving as he goes.

2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:16.000
 And he winds up starting to love this

2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:18.440
 like he never thought he would.

2:34:19.300 --> 2:34:22.760
 But it's great to see anybody grow.

2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:25.680
 And whether that be physically or that be emotionally

2:34:25.680 --> 2:34:28.840
 or whether it be just in their career,

2:34:28.840 --> 2:34:30.200
 it's great to see somebody grow.

2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:35.200
 And I like to tease him, funny admission here.

2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:38.880
 There are times when the jabs that I will throw at him

2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:40.840
 are something that we might know ahead of time

2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:42.440
 of what I'm going to say to him.

2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:45.720
 People will say, you're so mean to him.

2:34:45.720 --> 2:34:46.760
 I can't believe it.

2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:48.640
 You're, that's so abusive.

2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:51.380
 You know, like, dude, honestly, we laugh after it's over.

2:34:51.380 --> 2:34:53.120
 It's good, we're good, you know?

2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:54.760
 So, you know, of course, but like-

2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.640
 He's tougher than he looks is what you're saying.

2:34:56.640 --> 2:34:57.480
 He's tougher than he looks.

2:34:57.480 --> 2:34:58.320
 Believe me, believe me.

2:34:58.320 --> 2:34:59.140
 And he looks pretty tough now.

2:34:59.140 --> 2:35:00.160
 He's got the big beard.

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:01.440
 He looks more manly than I do.

2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:02.540
 I can't grow a beard.

2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:03.380
 I don't, yeah.

2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:05.640
 I mean, believe me, he's totally alpha

2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:07.860
 and I'm like, you know, quickly becoming, you know,

2:35:07.860 --> 2:35:09.560
 the second star of this show.

2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:14.100
 But like, you know, he's definitely contributed

2:35:14.100 --> 2:35:16.720
 and people enjoy his presence for sure.

2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:17.700
 Yeah, I certainly do.

2:35:17.700 --> 2:35:19.840
 And I think that as you pointed out,

2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:23.280
 he's a kind of a proxy and a template for everybody.

2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:26.020
 We can relate to him because even though I've trained

2:35:26.020 --> 2:35:28.440
 for many years, you know, it's been a struggle, you know,

2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:29.840
 through graduate school postdoc, you know,

2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:31.400
 it made it happen one way or another,

2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:34.720
 but with more or less attention and admittedly through,

2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:37.040
 you know, waxing, waning levels of motivation.

2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:40.000
 Although, you know, I'm fortunate that I do enjoy it.

2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:41.320
 What I think is nice about it too,

2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:45.640
 is that it's a realistic expectation that we set, I think.

2:35:45.640 --> 2:35:47.560
 You know, in other words, you're showcasing

2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:49.140
 what the journey actually looks like.

2:35:49.140 --> 2:35:52.280
 And he's been on the journey for, again, you know,

2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:54.560
 devotedly for let's say the last year and a half,

2:35:54.560 --> 2:35:56.760
 but on the journey for five years.

2:35:56.760 --> 2:35:59.880
 If I could make the gains that he did,

2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:04.480
 starting when I started training at, you know, 14, 15,

2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:05.880
 and you're saying, hey, by 20,

2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:08.580
 you're going to have the strength levels he does,

2:36:08.580 --> 2:36:11.680
 the physique that he does, the knowledge that you've gained.

2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:14.320
 Like that seems like a blink of an eye now looking back,

2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:17.240
 you know, at 46 years old, I'm like, holy cow.

2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:21.240
 Like, I think it took me 20 years, you know, 15, 20 years.

2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:24.080
 So, you know, to just even start to get into a groove.

2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:26.800
 For him to do it in a period of five years,

2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:27.820
 it doesn't seem long.

2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:30.080
 Whereas there's people that will criticize his journey.

2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:32.600
 Like, oh, it's just taking so long.

2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:34.720
 It's so like, there's such an instant gratification,

2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:36.600
 you know, that people seek.

2:36:36.600 --> 2:36:38.020
 Luckily, that's the minority.

2:36:38.020 --> 2:36:40.520
 Most people are like, this is amazing, you know?

2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:42.660
 But I think that it becomes very uplifting

2:36:42.660 --> 2:36:45.680
 because not only is it relatable, but the journey is real.

2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:48.360
 And people can appreciate that.

2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:49.360
 Like this is what will happen

2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:50.960
 if you actually put in consistent hard work

2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:52.160
 and you'll watch him transform

2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:53.120
 and go back and watch the videos.

2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:55.420
 Like you look at, we like to oftentimes throw back

2:36:55.420 --> 2:36:59.000
 to videos where he appeared as, you know,

2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.300
 smaller Jesse, but also shy Jesse.

2:37:01.300 --> 2:37:03.460
 Arms crossed, head down,

2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:05.960
 not making eye contact with the camera, you know,

2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:08.360
 to where now he's got his own skits and intros.

2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:11.160
 You know, it's like, it's funny because of the confidence

2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:13.360
 with the growth of physique came confidence too,

2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:14.360
 which is great.

2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:16.720
 Absolutely, it's pretty soon it'll be his world

2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:19.600
 and we'll all be living in it as they say.

2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:23.760
 Well, on behalf of myself and all the listeners,

2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:25.920
 I really want to thank you.

2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:27.420
 First of all, for the discussion today,

2:37:27.420 --> 2:37:29.080
 I learned an immense amount.

2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:30.860
 Even though I thought I knew your content well,

2:37:30.860 --> 2:37:32.400
 I still learned an immense amount,

2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:34.320
 many things we could deploy from when to stretch,

2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:36.440
 how to stretch, the skipping rope.

2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:37.440
 We talked about nutrition,

2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:40.580
 we talked about heat, cold, training regimens.

2:37:40.580 --> 2:37:43.980
 And what I love about all of this,

2:37:43.980 --> 2:37:44.980
 now that you've given us,

2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:48.260
 is that there's a backbone of logic, you know,

2:37:48.260 --> 2:37:51.280
 and some consistent themes indeed about consistency.

2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:53.400
 But the logical backbone, I think,

2:37:53.400 --> 2:37:57.280
 is what will enable people to really show up to the table

2:37:57.280 --> 2:38:00.320
 and stay there for training consistently over time.

2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:03.560
 As you said, the gift of fitness is an immense gift.

2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:05.000
 I can't thank you enough.

2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000
 I know you're an incredibly busy human being

2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.680
 with kids and dogs and a marriage and a thriving business.

2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:11.560
 It's my pleasure.

2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:12.840
 I'm happy I was able to make it work

2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:15.100
 because I really, I've been watching your stuff for a while

2:38:15.100 --> 2:38:17.040
 and I really, I love the science of it.

2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:18.960
 I like the way you think.

2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:21.400
 And it's just, you know,

2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:23.200
 I'm just really fortunate that I was able to do it.

2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:25.280
 Well, I feel very gratified in hearing that

2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:26.820
 and honored to have you here.

2:38:26.820 --> 2:38:27.960
 So thank you so much.

2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:28.840
 Thank you.

2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:29.660
 Thank you for joining me

2:38:29.660 --> 2:38:31.400
 for my discussion with Jeff Cavaliere.

2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:33.160
 I hope you found it as interesting

2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:35.360
 and as actionable as I did.

2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:24.320
 again, we partnered with Momentous Supplements.

2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:26.480

 please do so.

2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:34.760
 We are Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.

2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:37.140
 There, I cover science and science-based tools,

2:39:37.140 --> 2:39:38.800
 some of which overlap with the content

2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:40.000
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.880
 and other of which is distinct from the information covered

2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:44.140
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:39:44.140 --> 2:39:45.960
 So again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram

2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:48.560
 and also Huberman Lab on Twitter.

2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:49.800
 If you're not already subscribed

2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:52.560
 to our so-called neural network newsletter, please do so.

2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:54.800
 You can do that by going to HubermanLab.com,

2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:57.200
 go to the menu and click on newsletter.

2:39:57.200 --> 2:39:59.660
 It costs nothing to sign up or to receive the newsletters.

2:39:59.660 --> 2:40:01.600
 They come out about once a month

2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:04.300
 and they contain summaries of actionable protocols,

2:40:04.300 --> 2:40:06.520
 links to relevant scientific research.

2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:08.360
 We do not share your email with anybody

2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:11.400
 and our privacy policy is made clear at that site.

2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:13.560
 In fact, if you'd like to see some previous newsletters

2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:16.180
 or download those, you can download those as PDFs

2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:17.640
 without having to sign up at all

2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:19.600
 simply by going to HubermanLab.com,

2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:22.920
 go again into the newsletter tab under the menu

2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:26.080
 and there you'll see, for instance, a toolkit for sleep

2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:27.320
 that lists out all the things you can do

2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:28.840
 to enhance your sleep.

2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:32.060
 It lists out the so-called neuroplasticity super protocol

2:40:32.060 --> 2:40:34.720
 for enhancing learning and teaching and so on.

2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:36.600
 Again, that's the neural network newsletter

2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:38.200
 at HubermanLab.com.

2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:40.500
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:40:40.500 --> 2:40:42.360
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:40:42.360 --> 2:41:09.360
 I'll see you in the next one.
