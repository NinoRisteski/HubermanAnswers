00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.680
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.680 --> 00:13.880
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.880 --> 00:15.920
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.680
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.680 --> 00:19.680
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.200
 It is, however, part of my desire

00:21.200 --> 00:23.480
 to bring you zero cost to consumer information

00:23.480 --> 00:25.820
 about science and science-related tools.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.000
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.760
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.280
 Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.080
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses

00:35.080 --> 00:37.880
 that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.000
 Helix mattresses are amazing.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.120
 I can say this because I've been sleeping on one,

00:42.120 --> 00:45.740
 and I've been sleeping better than I've ever slept before.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.360
 The interesting thing about Helix mattresses

00:47.360 --> 00:50.480
 is that they're tailored to your unique body type

00:50.480 --> 00:52.240
 and sleeping style.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
 What's a sleeping style?

00:53.240 --> 00:55.480
 Well, if you go to the Helix site,

00:55.480 --> 00:56.740
 you can take a quick quiz.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.400
 It takes about two minutes

00:58.400 --> 01:00.480
 as to whether or not you sleep on your stomach,

01:00.480 --> 01:01.720
 your side, your back,

01:01.720 --> 01:02.940
 whether or not you flip back and forth,

01:02.940 --> 01:04.040
 or whether or not you don't know

01:04.040 --> 01:05.440
 in what position you sleep,

01:05.440 --> 01:08.560
 as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or run cold,

01:08.560 --> 01:11.440
 wake up cold, wake up hot, et cetera.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.520
 If you do that, then it will match you to the mattress

01:14.520 --> 01:16.840
 that's perfect for your sleep needs.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.480
 If you want to try a Helix mattress,

01:18.480 --> 01:21.520
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

01:21.520 --> 01:24.800
 and if you do that, you'll get $200 off your order

01:24.800 --> 01:26.240
 as well as two free pillows.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.860
 That's helixsleep.com slash Huberman.

01:29.860 --> 01:33.480
 The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.200
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

01:35.200 --> 01:38.120
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.920
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,

01:40.920 --> 01:43.400
 and I started using it because I had a lot of confusion

01:43.400 --> 01:45.720
 about what vitamins and minerals I should take,

01:45.720 --> 01:49.680
 and taking Athletic Greens allowed me to get the foundation

01:49.680 --> 01:51.180
 or sort of the base of everything I need

01:51.180 --> 01:54.240
 in one easy-to-consume formula.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.280
 It tastes great.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.160
 I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice,

01:58.160 --> 01:59.640
 and I like drinking it,

01:59.640 --> 02:02.400
 and the probiotics in there are important to me as well,

02:02.400 --> 02:04.680
 because there are a lot of data out there now

02:04.680 --> 02:06.800
 identifying the gut microbiome

02:06.800 --> 02:10.240
 and the importance of the gut brain axis

02:10.240 --> 02:12.920
 for immune function, metabolic function, and so forth.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.680
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

02:14.680 --> 02:18.200
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

02:18.200 --> 02:21.400
 and if you do that, they'll also send you a year's supply

02:21.400 --> 02:24.500
 of liquid vitamin D3K2.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.240
 There are a lot of data starting to surface

02:26.240 --> 02:29.440
 about the importance of vitamin D3 for immune function,

02:29.440 --> 02:32.360
 metabolic function, endocrine function, and so forth.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.920
 In addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

02:35.920 --> 02:38.820
 you'll get the year's supply of D3 and K2,

02:38.820 --> 02:41.480
 as well as five free travel packs,

02:41.480 --> 02:43.120
 which are little packets of Athletic Greens

02:43.120 --> 02:44.840
 in addition to your normal order,

02:44.840 --> 02:46.760
 and those are great for when you're on the plane

02:46.760 --> 02:48.220
 or you're otherwise traveling.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.720
 They mix up really easily without any mess

02:50.720 --> 02:53.280
 or the need to spoon out powder and things of that sort,

02:53.280 --> 02:55.120
 so the things that are easy to do at home

02:55.120 --> 02:56.240
 are kind of harder on the road.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.720
 Those packets make it easy while on the road.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.280
 Today, we're going to talk about dreaming,

03:01.280 --> 03:05.520
 learning during dreaming, and unlearning during dreaming,

03:05.520 --> 03:09.960
 in particular, unlearning of troubling emotional events.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.460
 Now, my interest in dreaming goes way back.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.240
 When I was a child, I had a friend,

03:15.240 --> 03:18.860
 and he came over one day and he brought with him a mask

03:18.860 --> 03:21.160
 that had a little red light in the corner.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.040
 He had purchased this thing through some magazine ad

03:24.040 --> 03:25.480
 that he had seen,

03:25.480 --> 03:30.240
 and this mask was supposed to trigger lucid dreaming.

03:30.240 --> 03:34.040
 Lucid dreaming is the experience of dreaming during sleep,

03:34.040 --> 03:37.120
 but being aware that one is dreaming,

03:37.120 --> 03:39.440
 and in some cases, being able to direct

03:39.440 --> 03:41.600
 one's dream activities.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.820
 So if you're in a lucid dream

03:43.820 --> 03:45.540
 and you want to fly, for instance,

03:45.540 --> 03:47.920
 some people report being able to initiate

03:47.920 --> 03:51.360
 that experience of flying or to contort themselves

03:51.360 --> 03:54.320
 into an animal or to transport themselves

03:54.320 --> 03:56.600
 to wherever they want within the dream.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.680
 I tried this device.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.640
 The way it worked is you put on the mask

04:01.640 --> 04:03.640
 during the waking state, wide awake,

04:03.640 --> 04:06.800
 and you'd look at the little light flashing in the corner,

04:06.800 --> 04:08.800
 and then you'd also wear it when you went to sleep at night.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.360
 And indeed, while I was asleep,

04:10.360 --> 04:13.400
 I could see the red light presumably through my eyelids,

04:13.400 --> 04:16.000
 although for all I know, I had opened my eyes.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.400
 I don't know, I was asleep.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.240
 And then because I was dreaming

04:19.240 --> 04:22.440
 and I was experiencing something very vivid,

04:22.440 --> 04:24.720
 I was able to recognize that I was dreaming

04:24.720 --> 04:26.200
 and then start to direct some of the events

04:26.200 --> 04:27.440
 within that dream.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.580
 Now, lucid dreaming occurs in about 20% of people,

04:30.580 --> 04:32.840
 and in a small percentage of those people,

04:32.840 --> 04:34.800
 they lucid dream almost every night,

04:34.800 --> 04:37.440
 so much so that many of them report their sleep

04:37.440 --> 04:41.380
 not being as restorative as it would be otherwise.

04:41.380 --> 04:46.120
 Now, all of this is to say that lucid dreaming and dreaming

04:46.120 --> 04:48.140
 are profound experiences.

04:48.140 --> 04:53.140
 We tend to feel extremely attached to our dream experience.

04:53.340 --> 04:55.000
 This may explain the phenomenon

04:55.000 --> 04:56.900
 of people who have a very intense dream,

04:56.900 --> 04:59.080
 they need to somehow tell everybody about that dream

04:59.080 --> 05:00.280
 or tell someone about that dream.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.740
 I don't really know what that behavior is about,

05:02.740 --> 05:05.520
 but sometimes we wake up and we feel so attached

05:05.520 --> 05:08.020
 to what happened in this state that we call dreaming

05:08.020 --> 05:09.440
 that there seems to be an intense need

05:09.440 --> 05:10.520
 to share it with other people,

05:10.520 --> 05:13.280
 presumably to process it and make sense of it.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.780
 Now, numerous people throughout history

05:14.780 --> 05:17.040
 have tried to make sense of dreams

05:17.040 --> 05:18.560
 in some sort of organized way.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.920
 The most famous of which, of course, is Sigmund Freud,

05:20.920 --> 05:23.600
 who talked about symbolic representations in dreams.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.700
 A lot of that has been kind of debunked,

05:25.700 --> 05:28.680
 although I think that there's some interest

05:28.680 --> 05:31.100
 in what the symbols of dreaming are,

05:31.100 --> 05:32.500
 and this is something that we'll talk about

05:32.500 --> 05:33.560
 in more depth today,

05:33.560 --> 05:38.280
 although not Freudian theory in particular.

05:38.280 --> 05:42.060
 So I think in order to really think about dreams

05:42.060 --> 05:43.200
 and what to do with them

05:43.200 --> 05:46.960
 and how to maximize the dream experience

05:46.960 --> 05:49.440
 for sake of learning and unlearning,

05:49.440 --> 05:50.940
 the best way to address this

05:50.940 --> 05:52.880
 is to look at the physiology of sleep,

05:52.880 --> 05:56.760
 to really just what do we know concretely about sleep?

05:56.760 --> 05:59.140
 So first of all, as we get sleepy,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.060
 we tend to shut our eyes,

06:02.060 --> 06:04.160
 and that's because there are some autonomic centers

06:04.160 --> 06:06.520
 in the brain, some neurons that control closing

06:06.520 --> 06:08.240
 of the eyelids when we get sleepy,

06:08.240 --> 06:10.080
 and then we transition into sleep.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.880
 And sleep, regardless of how long we sleep,

06:12.880 --> 06:16.340
 is generally broken up into a series of 90-minute cycles,

06:16.340 --> 06:18.800
 these ultradian cycles.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.120
 So early in the night,

06:21.120 --> 06:23.780
 these 90-minute cycles tend to be comprised

06:23.780 --> 06:26.720
 more of shallow sleep and slow-wave sleep,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.440
 so stage one, stage two, et cetera,

06:28.440 --> 06:29.880
 and what we call slow-wave sleep.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.480
 I'll go into detail about what all this means in a moment.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.520
 And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep,

06:35.520 --> 06:38.780
 R-E-M sleep, which stands for rapid eye movement sleep,

06:38.780 --> 06:41.360
 and I'll talk about rapid eye movement sleep in detail.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.200
 So early in the night, a lot more slow-wave sleep

06:44.200 --> 06:45.940
 and less REM.

06:45.940 --> 06:48.760
 For every 90-minute cycle that we have

06:48.760 --> 06:50.680
 during a night of sleep,

06:50.680 --> 06:55.200
 we tend to start having more and more REM sleep.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.680
 So more of that 90-minute cycle is comprised of REM sleep

06:58.680 --> 07:00.460
 and less of slow-wave sleep.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.320
 Now, this is true regardless of whether or not

07:02.320 --> 07:04.720
 you wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom

07:04.720 --> 07:06.220
 or your sleep is broken.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.760
 The more sleep you're getting across the night,

07:09.760 --> 07:11.880
 the more REM sleep you're going to have.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.680
 And REM sleep and non-REM, as I'll refer to it,

07:15.680 --> 07:18.520
 have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning,

07:18.520 --> 07:20.800
 and they are responsible for learning and unlearning

07:20.800 --> 07:23.280
 of distinctly different types of information.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.560
 And this has enormous implications

07:26.560 --> 07:29.080
 for learning of motor skills,

07:29.080 --> 07:31.480
 for unlearning of traumatic events

07:31.480 --> 07:33.640
 or for processing emotionally challenging

07:33.640 --> 07:36.400
 as well as emotionally pleasing events.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.920
 And as we'll see,

07:37.920 --> 07:41.080
 one can actually leverage their daytime activities

07:41.080 --> 07:43.620
 in order to access more slow-wave sleep

07:43.620 --> 07:45.960
 or non-REM sleep as we'll call it,

07:45.960 --> 07:48.700
 or more REM sleep depending on your particular

07:48.700 --> 07:50.660
 emotional and physical needs.

07:50.660 --> 07:52.560
 So it's really a remarkable stage of life

07:52.560 --> 07:55.240
 that we have a lot more control and power over

07:55.240 --> 07:56.920
 than you might believe.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.520
 We'll also talk about lucid dreaming.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.760
 We're also going to talk about hallucinations

08:00.760 --> 08:03.080
 and how drug-induced hallucinations

08:03.080 --> 08:06.480
 have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states

08:06.480 --> 08:09.120
 and yet some really important differences.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.160
 Okay, so let's start by talking about slow-wave sleep

08:13.160 --> 08:14.760
 or non-REM sleep.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.520
 Now I realize that slow-wave sleep and non-REM sleep

08:17.520 --> 08:18.940
 aren't exactly the same thing.

08:18.940 --> 08:21.060
 So for you sleep aficionados out there,

08:21.060 --> 08:23.240
 I am lumping right now, as we say in science,

08:23.240 --> 08:26.320
 there are lumpers and there are splitters, and I am both.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.480
 Sometimes I lump, sometimes I split.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.800
 For sake of clarity and ease of conversation right now,

08:31.800 --> 08:32.860
 I'm going to be a lumper.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.580
 So when I say slow-wave sleep,

08:34.580 --> 08:36.960
 I mean non-REM sleep generally,

08:36.960 --> 08:39.700
 although I acknowledge there is a distinction.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.640
 Slow-wave sleep.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.440
 So slow-wave sleep is characterized

08:44.440 --> 08:47.500
 by a particular pattern of brain activity

08:47.500 --> 08:50.440
 in which the brain is metabolically active,

08:50.440 --> 08:53.400
 but that there's these big sweeping waves of activity

08:53.400 --> 08:55.800
 that include a lot of the brain.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.680
 If you want to look this up there,

08:57.680 --> 09:01.520
 you can find evidence for sweeping of waves

09:01.520 --> 09:04.800
 of neural activity across association cortex,

09:04.800 --> 09:07.660
 across big swaths of the brainstem,

09:07.660 --> 09:11.880
 the so-called Pons geniculate occipital pathway.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.880
 This is brainstem, thalamus, and then cortex,

09:17.180 --> 09:18.680
 for those of you that are interested,

09:18.680 --> 09:21.780
 although more of that is going to occur in REM sleep.

09:21.780 --> 09:24.160
 Now, the interesting thing about slow-wave sleep

09:24.160 --> 09:28.120
 are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it

09:28.120 --> 09:30.080
 that are most active and least active

09:30.080 --> 09:31.200
 during slow-wave sleep.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.900
 And here's why.

09:32.900 --> 09:36.360
 To remind you, neuromodulators are these chemicals

09:36.360 --> 09:38.120
 that act rather slowly,

09:38.120 --> 09:42.200
 but their main role is to bias particular brain circuits

09:42.200 --> 09:45.040
 to be active and other brain circuits to not be active.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.840
 These are like the music playlist.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.100
 So think of neuromodulators,

09:49.100 --> 09:51.120
 and these come in the names of acetylcholine,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.320
 norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.

09:53.320 --> 09:58.000
 Think of them as suggesting playlists on your audio device.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
 So classical music is distinctly different in feel and tone

10:03.080 --> 10:06.720
 and a number of other features from like third-wave punk

10:06.720 --> 10:10.260
 or from hip hop, right?

10:10.260 --> 10:13.220
 So think of them as biasing toward particular genres

10:13.220 --> 10:15.600
 of neural circuit activity, okay?

10:15.600 --> 10:19.020
 Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music

10:19.020 --> 10:21.800
 or rhythmic music that includes lyrics

10:21.800 --> 10:24.240
 versus rhythmic music that doesn't include lyrics.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.640
 That's more or less the way

10:25.640 --> 10:27.960
 to think about these neuromodulators.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.880
 And they are associated as a consequence

10:29.880 --> 10:31.480
 with certain brain functions.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.860
 So we know for instance,

10:32.860 --> 10:36.120
 and just to review acetylcholine in waking states

10:36.120 --> 10:38.960
 is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the activity

10:38.960 --> 10:42.280
 of brain circuits associated with focus and attention.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.040
 Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator

10:44.040 --> 10:46.400
 that tends to amplify the brain circuits associated

10:46.400 --> 10:49.600
 with alertness and the desire to move.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.760
 Serotonin is the neuromodulator that's released

10:52.760 --> 10:55.640
 and tends to amplify the circuits in the brain and body

10:55.640 --> 10:59.600
 that are associated with bliss and the desire to remain still

10:59.600 --> 11:03.120
 and dopamine is the neuromodulator that's released

11:03.120 --> 11:06.480
 and is associated with amplification of the neural circuits

11:06.480 --> 11:08.960
 in the brain and body associated with pursuing goals

11:08.960 --> 11:11.940
 and pleasure and reward, okay?

11:11.940 --> 11:14.280
 So in slow wave sleep,

11:14.280 --> 11:17.080
 something really interesting happens.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.760
 There's essentially no acetylcholine.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.760
 Acetylcholine production and release and action

11:22.760 --> 11:26.400
 from the two major sites, which are in the brainstem,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.560
 which from a nucleus,

11:27.560 --> 11:30.960
 it's a parabigeminal nucleus if you really want to know

11:30.960 --> 11:34.520
 or from the forebrain, which is nucleus basalis

11:34.520 --> 11:35.720
 and you don't need to know these names,

11:35.720 --> 11:38.340
 but if you like, that's why I put them out there.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.840
 Acetylcholine production plummets.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.920
 It's just almost to zero and acetylcholine,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.800
 as I just mentioned, is associated with focus.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.440
 So you can think of slow wave sleep

11:48.440 --> 11:51.160
 as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain

11:51.160 --> 11:53.640
 and a kind of distortion of space and time

11:53.640 --> 11:56.720
 so that we're not really focusing on any one thing.

11:56.720 --> 12:01.440
 Now, the other molecules that are very active at that time

12:01.440 --> 12:04.120
 are norepinephrine, which is a little bit surprising

12:04.120 --> 12:06.000
 because normally in waking states,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.800
 norepinephrine is going to be associated

12:07.800 --> 12:10.880
 with a lot of alertness and the desire to move,

12:10.880 --> 12:13.320
 but there's not a ton of norepinephrine

12:13.320 --> 12:15.400
 around in slow wave sleep, but it is around.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.840
 So there's something associated

12:16.840 --> 12:20.280
 with the movement circuitry going on in slow wave sleep.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.820
 And remember, this is happening mostly

12:21.820 --> 12:22.960
 at the beginning of the night.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.440
 Your sleep is dominated by slow wave sleep.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.920
 So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine,

12:28.920 --> 12:31.760
 although there is some, and a lot of serotonin.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.880
 And serotonin, again, is associated with this desire,

12:34.880 --> 12:37.340
 the sensation of kind of bliss or wellbeing,

12:37.340 --> 12:38.400
 but not a lot of movement.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.120
 And during sleep, you tend not to move.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.060
 Now, in slow wave sleep, you can move.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.600
 You're not paralyzed, so you can roll over.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.520
 If people are going to sleepwalk,

12:47.520 --> 12:50.300
 typically it's going to be during slow wave sleep.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.200
 And what studies have shown

12:53.200 --> 12:56.380
 through some kind of sadistic experiments

12:56.380 --> 12:59.780
 where people are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep,

12:59.780 --> 13:02.120
 and that can be done by waking them up

13:02.120 --> 13:04.160
 as soon as the electrode recording show

13:04.160 --> 13:05.720
 that they're in slow wave sleep,

13:05.720 --> 13:08.360
 or by chemically altering their sleep

13:08.360 --> 13:11.080
 so that it biases them away from slow wave sleep.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.600
 What studies have shown is that motor learning

13:13.600 --> 13:18.080
 is generally occurring in slow wave sleep.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.680
 So let's say the day before you go to sleep,

13:20.680 --> 13:23.620
 you were learning some new dance move,

13:23.620 --> 13:26.280
 or you were learning some specific motor skill,

13:26.280 --> 13:29.340
 either a fine motor skill or a course motor skill.

13:29.340 --> 13:32.360
 So let's say it's a new form of exercise

13:32.360 --> 13:34.640
 or some new coordinated movements.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.360
 This could be coordinated movement

13:36.360 --> 13:37.560
 at the level of the fingers,

13:37.560 --> 13:38.600
 or it could be coordinated movement

13:38.600 --> 13:41.520
 at the level of the whole body and large limb movements.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.580
 It could involve other people,

13:42.580 --> 13:44.360
 or it could be a solo activity.

13:44.360 --> 13:48.740
 Learning of those skills is happening

13:48.740 --> 13:50.740
 primarily during slow wave sleep

13:50.740 --> 13:52.600
 in the early part of the night.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.060
 In addition, slow wave sleep has been shown to be important

13:56.060 --> 13:59.200
 for the learning of detailed information.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.360
 Now, this isn't always cognitive information.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.880
 We're going to talk about cognitive information,

14:02.880 --> 14:05.560
 but the studies that have been done along these lines

14:05.560 --> 14:09.840
 involve having people learn very detailed information

14:09.840 --> 14:11.360
 about very specific rules

14:11.360 --> 14:13.680
 and the way that certain words are spelled.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.360
 They tend to be challenging words.

14:15.360 --> 14:20.360
 So if people are tested in terms of their performance

14:20.400 --> 14:22.240
 on these types of exams,

14:22.240 --> 14:24.440
 and they're deprived of slow wave sleep,

14:24.440 --> 14:26.560
 they tend to perform very poorly.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.420
 So we can think of slow wave sleep

14:28.420 --> 14:31.880
 as important for motor learning, motor skill learning,

14:31.880 --> 14:34.360
 and for the learning of specific details

14:34.360 --> 14:36.400
 about specific events.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.200
 And this turns out to be fundamentally important

14:39.200 --> 14:43.000
 because now we know that slow wave sleep

14:43.000 --> 14:45.040
 is primarily in the early part of the night,

14:45.040 --> 14:48.400
 and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night

14:48.400 --> 14:51.720
 and detail learning is occurring early in the night.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.420
 Now, for those of you that are waking up

14:53.420 --> 14:55.240
 after only three, four hours of sleep,

14:55.240 --> 14:56.680
 this might be informative.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.560
 This might tell you a little something

14:58.560 --> 15:01.320
 about what you are able to learn and not able to learn

15:01.320 --> 15:03.660
 if that were to be the only sleep that you get,

15:03.660 --> 15:06.460
 although hopefully that's not the only sleep that you get.

15:06.460 --> 15:09.780
 But we're going to dive deep into how it is

15:09.780 --> 15:12.440
 that one can maximize motor learning

15:12.440 --> 15:16.520
 in order to extract, say, more detail information

15:16.520 --> 15:18.780
 about coordinated movements

15:18.780 --> 15:20.800
 and how to make them faster or slower.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.760
 So that might be important for certain sports.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.820
 It might be almost certainly important for certain sports.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.280
 It's going to be important

15:28.280 --> 15:30.280
 for any kind of coordinated movement,

15:30.280 --> 15:32.160
 like, say, learning to play the piano,

15:32.160 --> 15:37.160
 or, for instance, how to learn synchronized movements

15:37.740 --> 15:38.580
 with somebody else.

15:38.580 --> 15:41.420
 So maybe I mentioned the example of dance earlier.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.760
 If you, like me, a few years ago,

15:43.760 --> 15:45.620
 I set out to learn tango

15:45.620 --> 15:49.280
 because I have some Argentine relatives and I was abysmal.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.240
 I need to return to that at some point.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.700
 I was just abysmal.

15:53.700 --> 15:54.840
 And one of the worst things

15:54.840 --> 15:56.260
 about being abysmal at learning dance

15:56.260 --> 15:57.100
 is that there's somebody else

15:57.100 --> 15:59.120
 has to suffer the consequences also.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.920
 So I don't know, maybe in a month on neuroplasticity,

16:02.920 --> 16:06.180
 I'll explore that again as a self-experimentation.

16:06.180 --> 16:08.760
 But the key things to know are slow-wave sleep

16:08.760 --> 16:11.800
 involved in motor learning and detailed learning.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.320
 There's no acetylcholine around at that time.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.480
 Has this big amplitude activity

16:16.480 --> 16:18.060
 sweeping throughout the brain.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.640
 And that there's the release of these neuromodulators,

16:20.640 --> 16:23.040
 norepinephrine and serotonin.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.720
 And again, that's all happening early in the night.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.640
 So athletes, people that are concerned about performance,

16:29.640 --> 16:32.800
 if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours

16:32.800 --> 16:35.120
 of three, four hours of sleep

16:35.120 --> 16:38.120
 because you're excited about a competition the next day,

16:38.120 --> 16:42.000
 presumably, if you've already trained the skills

16:42.000 --> 16:43.480
 that you need for the event,

16:43.480 --> 16:47.380
 you should be fine to engage in that particular activity.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.280
 Now, it's always going to be better

16:49.280 --> 16:51.200
 to get a full night's sleep.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.880
 And a full night's sleep for you is six hours,

16:53.880 --> 16:56.480
 and it's always going to be better to get more sleep

16:56.480 --> 16:57.760
 than it is to get less.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.160
 However, I think some people

17:00.440 --> 17:02.860
 get a little bit overly concerned

17:02.860 --> 17:04.400
 that if they didn't get their full night's sleep

17:04.400 --> 17:06.240
 before some sort of physical event,

17:06.240 --> 17:07.840
 that their performance is going to plummet.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.140
 Presumably, if you've already learned what you need to do

17:11.140 --> 17:13.680
 and it's stored in your neural circuits,

17:13.680 --> 17:15.720
 and you know how to make those coordinated movements,

17:15.720 --> 17:17.680
 what the literature on slow-wave sleep suggests

17:17.680 --> 17:19.280
 is that you would be replenished.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.760
 That the motor learning and the recovery from exercise

17:21.760 --> 17:24.340
 is going to happen early in the night.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.680
 So we'll just pause there

17:25.680 --> 17:27.460
 and kind of shelve that for a moment,

17:27.460 --> 17:28.920
 and then we're going to come back to it.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.640
 But I want to talk about REM sleep,

17:30.640 --> 17:32.760
 or rapid eye movement sleep.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.520
 REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep,

17:35.520 --> 17:37.960
 as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night,

17:37.960 --> 17:39.480
 but you're going to have more of it.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.000
 A larger percentage of these 90-minute sleep cycles

17:42.000 --> 17:44.020
 is going to be comprised of REM sleep

17:44.020 --> 17:46.600
 as you get toward morning.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.160
 REM sleep is fascinating.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.680
 It was discovered in the 50s

17:49.680 --> 17:53.000
 when a sleep laboratory in Chicago,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.260
 the researchers observed that people's eyes

17:55.260 --> 17:56.840
 were moving under their eyelids.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.100
 Now, something very important that we're going to address

18:00.100 --> 18:02.480
 when we talk about trauma later

18:02.480 --> 18:05.360
 is that the eye movements are not just side to side.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.040
 They're very erratic in all different directions.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.760
 One thing that I don't think anyone,

18:09.760 --> 18:11.940
 I've never heard anyone really talk about publicly

18:11.940 --> 18:15.140
 is why eye movements during sleep, right?

18:15.140 --> 18:17.040
 Eyes are closed, and sometimes people's eyelids

18:17.040 --> 18:18.960
 will be a little bit open and their eyes are darting around,

18:18.960 --> 18:20.200
 especially in little kids.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.460
 I don't suggest you do this.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.560
 I'm not even sure it's ethical,

18:22.560 --> 18:25.160
 but it has been done where you pull back the eyelids

18:25.160 --> 18:26.140
 of a kid while they're sleeping

18:26.140 --> 18:28.200
 and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.960
 I think people do this to their passed out friends

18:29.960 --> 18:31.280
 at parties and things like that.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.400
 So again, I don't suggest you do it,

18:33.400 --> 18:35.960
 but I'm telling you it because it's been done before

18:35.960 --> 18:38.480
 and therefore you don't have to do it again.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.600
 But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating

18:41.600 --> 18:44.200
 and occurs because there are connections

18:44.200 --> 18:48.240
 between the brainstem, an area called the pons,

18:48.240 --> 18:52.880
 and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brainstem

18:52.880 --> 18:55.420
 that are involved in generating movements

18:55.420 --> 18:57.520
 in different directions, sometimes called saccades,

18:57.520 --> 18:59.360
 although sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep,

18:59.360 --> 19:01.880
 it's not just rapid, it's kind of a jittery side-to-side

19:01.880 --> 19:03.520
 thing and then the eyeballs kind of roll.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.080
 It's really pretty creepy to look at if you see.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.600
 So what's happening there is the circuitry

19:09.600 --> 19:11.400
 that is involved in conscious eye movements

19:11.400 --> 19:13.540
 is kind of going haywire, but it's not haywire.

19:13.540 --> 19:17.160
 It's these waves of activity from the brainstem

19:17.160 --> 19:18.680
 up to the so-called thalamus,

19:18.680 --> 19:21.560
 which is an area that filters sensory information

19:21.560 --> 19:23.520
 and then up to the cortex.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.840
 And the cortex, of course,

19:24.840 --> 19:27.440
 is involved in conscious perceptions.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.500
 So in rapid eye movement sleep,

19:29.500 --> 19:30.740
 there are a couple of things are happening

19:30.740 --> 19:33.320
 besides rapid eye movements.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.440
 The main ones are that they're, I should say,

19:36.440 --> 19:39.180
 in contrast to slow wave sleep.

19:39.180 --> 19:44.180
 In REM sleep, serotonin is essentially absent, okay?

19:44.280 --> 19:46.900
 So this molecule, this neuromodulator

19:46.900 --> 19:49.920
 that tends to create the feeling of bliss and wellbeing

19:49.920 --> 19:54.840
 and just calm, placidity is absent, all right?

19:54.840 --> 19:56.320
 So that's interesting.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.920
 In addition to that, norepinephrine,

19:59.920 --> 20:02.660
 this molecule that's involved in movement and alertness

20:02.660 --> 20:04.320
 is absolutely absent.

20:04.320 --> 20:09.040
 It's probably one of the few times in our life

20:09.040 --> 20:12.800
 that epinephrine is essentially at zero activity

20:12.800 --> 20:14.000
 within our system.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.020
 And that has a number of very important implications

20:17.020 --> 20:20.640
 for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM sleep

20:20.640 --> 20:23.160
 and the sorts of learning that can occur

20:23.160 --> 20:24.500
 in REM sleep and unlearning.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.440
 First of all, in REM sleep, we are paralyzed.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.360
 We are experiencing what's called atonia,

20:30.360 --> 20:32.760
 which just means that we're completely laid out

20:32.760 --> 20:34.040
 and paralyzed.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.920
 We also tend to experience whatever it is

20:36.920 --> 20:40.520
 that we're dreaming about as a kind of hallucination

20:40.520 --> 20:42.640
 or a hallucinatory activity.

20:42.640 --> 20:47.480
 Long ago, I looked into hallucinations and dreaming.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.760
 I was just fascinated by this in high school.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.840
 And there's some great books on this if you're interested

20:51.840 --> 20:53.780
 in exploring the relationship

20:53.780 --> 20:56.540
 between hallucinations and dreaming.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.700
 The most famous of which are from a guy,

20:58.700 --> 21:02.400
 researcher at Harvard, Alan Hobson.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.480
 I wrote a book called Dream Drugstore

21:05.480 --> 21:06.980
 and talked all about the similarities

21:06.980 --> 21:08.880
 between drugs that induce hallucinations

21:08.880 --> 21:10.500
 and dreaming in REM.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.440
 So you can explore that if you like.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.460
 So in REM, our eyes are moving,

21:14.460 --> 21:16.580
 but the rest of our body is paralyzed

21:16.580 --> 21:18.280
 and we are hallucinating.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.000
 There's no epinephrine around.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.040
 Epinephrine doesn't just create a desire

21:24.040 --> 21:25.720
 to move and alertness.

21:25.720 --> 21:30.720
 It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.780
 It's what's released from our adrenal glands

21:34.780 --> 21:38.600
 when we experience something that's fearful or alerting.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.620
 So if a car suddenly screeches in front of us

21:40.620 --> 21:42.840
 or we get a troubling text message,

21:42.840 --> 21:44.600
 adrenaline is deployed into our system.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.120
 Adrenaline is epinephrine.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.440
 Those are equivalent molecules.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.200
 And epinephrine isn't just released from our adrenals.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.320
 It's also released within our brain.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.560
 So there's this weird stage of our life

21:56.560 --> 22:00.000
 that happens more toward morning that we call REM sleep

22:00.000 --> 22:02.340
 where we're hallucinating

22:02.340 --> 22:05.840
 and having these outrageous experiences in our mind,

22:05.840 --> 22:08.360
 but the chemical that's associated

22:08.360 --> 22:13.360
 with fear and panic and anxiety is not available to us.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.880
 And that turns out to be very important.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.040
 And you can imagine why that's important.

22:19.040 --> 22:23.640
 It's important because it allows us to experience things,

22:23.640 --> 22:26.440
 both replay of things that did occur

22:26.440 --> 22:28.880
 as well as elaborate contortions

22:28.880 --> 22:31.080
 of things that didn't occur.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.160
 And it allows us to experience those

22:33.160 --> 22:36.540
 in the absence of fear and anxiety.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.760
 And that it turns out is very important

22:39.760 --> 22:42.480
 for adjusting our emotional relationship

22:42.480 --> 22:44.980
 to challenging things that happened to us

22:44.980 --> 22:46.800
 while we were awake.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.600
 Those challenging things can sometimes be

22:48.600 --> 22:52.200
 in the form of social anxiety

22:52.200 --> 22:54.480
 or just having been working very hard

22:54.480 --> 22:56.960
 or concern about an upcoming event,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.480
 or sometimes people report, for instance,

22:59.480 --> 23:02.560
 dreams where they find themselves late to an exam

23:02.560 --> 23:07.560
 or naked in public or in some sort of situation

23:07.980 --> 23:10.240
 that would be very troubling to them.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.900
 And that almost certainly occurs during REM sleep.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.920
 So we have this incredible period of sleep

23:17.920 --> 23:22.400
 in which our experience of emotionally laden events

23:22.400 --> 23:25.640
 is dissociated, it's chemically blocked

23:25.640 --> 23:28.940
 from us having the actual emotion.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.360
 Now, probably immediately some of you are thinking,

23:31.360 --> 23:33.120
 well, what about nightmares? I have nightmares

23:33.120 --> 23:34.500
 and those carry a lot of emotion,

23:34.500 --> 23:36.460
 or sometimes I'll wake up in a panic.

23:36.460 --> 23:38.520
 Let's consider each of those two things separately

23:38.520 --> 23:41.300
 because they are important in understanding REM sleep.

23:42.660 --> 23:44.800
 There's a good chance that nightmares

23:44.800 --> 23:47.880
 are occurring during slow wave sleep.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.720
 There are actually some drugs

23:49.720 --> 23:51.080
 that I don't suggest people take,

23:51.080 --> 23:53.240
 in fact, so much so I'm not gonna mention them,

23:53.240 --> 23:58.240
 that give people very kind of scary or eerie dreams

23:58.240 --> 24:02.040
 and this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them

24:02.040 --> 24:06.480
 or that they can't move when they are being chased.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.240
 That's actually a common dream that I've had,

24:08.240 --> 24:10.180
 I guess it's more or less a nightmare,

24:10.180 --> 24:12.000
 the feeling that one is paralyzed

24:12.000 --> 24:13.680
 and can't move and is being chased.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.320
 A lot of people have said, oh, that must be in REM sleep

24:16.320 --> 24:17.600
 because you're paralyzed

24:17.600 --> 24:19.280
 and so you're dreaming about being paralyzed

24:19.280 --> 24:20.600
 and you can't move.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.060
 I think that's probably false.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.800
 The research says that because norepinephrine

24:24.800 --> 24:26.320
 is absent during REM sleep,

24:26.320 --> 24:28.580
 it's very unlikely that you can have these intense,

24:28.580 --> 24:29.720
 fearful memories.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.240
 So those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep,

24:32.240 --> 24:33.520
 although there might be instances

24:33.520 --> 24:36.260
 where people have nightmares in REM sleep.

24:36.260 --> 24:39.440
 The other thing is some people experience,

24:39.440 --> 24:42.240
 certainly I've had this experience of waking up

24:42.240 --> 24:45.600
 and feeling very stressed about whatever it was

24:45.600 --> 24:46.960
 that I happened to be thinking about

24:46.960 --> 24:49.680
 or dreaming about in the moments before.

24:49.680 --> 24:53.060
 And that's an interesting case of an invasion

24:53.060 --> 24:55.720
 of the dream state into the waking state

24:55.720 --> 24:59.320
 and the moment you wake up, epinephrine is available.

24:59.320 --> 25:02.640
 So the research on this isn't fully crystallized,

25:02.640 --> 25:05.040
 but most of it points in the direction

25:05.040 --> 25:09.220
 of the experience of waking up and feeling very panicked.

25:09.220 --> 25:11.560
 Maybe, I wanna highlight may,

25:11.560 --> 25:14.720
 but maybe that you were experiencing something

25:14.720 --> 25:17.560
 that was troubling in the daytime,

25:17.560 --> 25:20.160
 you're repeating that experience in your sleep,

25:20.160 --> 25:21.680
 epinephrine is not available

25:21.680 --> 25:24.160
 and therefore the brain circuits associated

25:24.160 --> 25:27.160
 with fear and anxiety are shut off

25:27.160 --> 25:29.860
 and so you're able to process those events.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.360
 And then suddenly you wake up

25:31.360 --> 25:34.240
 and there's a surge of adrenaline, of epinephrine

25:34.240 --> 25:36.360
 that's now coupled to that experience.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.040
 So nightmares very likely in slow wave sleep

25:39.040 --> 25:41.720
 and that kind of panic on waking from something

25:41.720 --> 25:45.360
 very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas,

25:45.360 --> 25:49.920
 however distorted in REM sleep, invading the waking state.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.240
 In fact, that brings to mind something

25:52.240 --> 25:53.440
 that I've mentioned once before,

25:53.440 --> 25:55.720
 but I wanna mention again, this atonia,

25:55.720 --> 25:58.360
 this paralysis that we experienced during sleep

25:58.360 --> 26:00.340
 can invade the waking state.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.880
 Many people report the experience of waking up

26:03.880 --> 26:05.480
 and being paralyzed.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.880
 They're legitimately waking up, it's not a dream.

26:07.880 --> 26:11.720
 Waking up and being paralyzed and it is terrifying.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.040
 I've had this happen before.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.520
 It is, I can tell you, terrifying to be wide awake

26:16.520 --> 26:19.500
 and as far as I could tell, fully conscious,

26:19.500 --> 26:21.040
 but unable to move.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.620
 And then generally you can jolt yourself out of it

26:23.620 --> 26:26.640
 in a few seconds, but it is quite frightening.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.820
 Now, some people actually experience waking up,

26:30.820 --> 26:34.320
 being fully paralyzed and hallucinating.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.700
 And there is a theory in the academic

26:37.700 --> 26:39.420
 and scientific community at least

26:39.420 --> 26:42.460
 that what people report as alien abductions

26:42.460 --> 26:45.400
 have a certain number of core characteristics

26:45.400 --> 26:48.640
 that map quite closely, eerily similarly

26:48.640 --> 26:50.920
 to these experiences.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.760
 A lot of reports of alien abduction

26:52.760 --> 26:55.040
 involve people being unable to move,

26:55.040 --> 26:58.780
 seeing particular faces, hallucinating,

26:58.780 --> 27:00.840
 extensively feeling like their body is floating

27:00.840 --> 27:03.000
 or they were transported.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.960
 This is very similar to the experience

27:05.960 --> 27:08.520
 of invasion of atonia into the waking state.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.440
 Waking up and still being paralyzed

27:10.440 --> 27:13.420
 as well as the hallucinations that are characteristic

27:13.420 --> 27:15.140
 of dreaming in REM sleep.

27:15.140 --> 27:18.900
 Now, I'm not saying that people's alien abductions

27:18.900 --> 27:20.480
 were not legitimate alien abductions.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.320
 How could I?

27:21.320 --> 27:22.160
 I wasn't there.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.840
 And if I was there, I wouldn't tell you

27:24.840 --> 27:26.480
 because that would make me an alien.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.180
 And I wouldn't want you to know.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.420
 But it is quite possible

27:31.420 --> 27:33.880
 that people are experiencing these things

27:33.880 --> 27:35.980
 and they are an invasion of the sleep state

27:35.980 --> 27:37.200
 into the waking state.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.680
 And they can last several minutes or longer.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.640
 And because in dreams, space and time are distorted,

27:42.640 --> 27:44.520
 our perception of these events could be

27:44.520 --> 27:46.040
 that they lasted many hours

27:46.040 --> 27:48.900
 and we can really feel as if they lasted many hours

27:48.900 --> 27:51.160
 when in fact they took only moments.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.260
 And we're going to return to distortion of space and time

27:53.260 --> 27:54.480
 in a little bit.

27:54.480 --> 27:58.680
 So to just recap where we've gone so far,

27:58.680 --> 28:00.920
 slow wave sleep early in the night,

28:00.920 --> 28:03.720
 it's been shown to be important for motor learning

28:03.720 --> 28:05.640
 and for detail learning.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.480
 REM sleep has a certain dream component

28:08.480 --> 28:10.520
 when which there's no epinephrine.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.320
 Therefore we can't experience anxiety.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.800
 We are paralyzed.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.280
 Those dreams tend to be really vivid

28:16.280 --> 28:18.520
 and have a lot of detail to them.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.840
 And yet in REM sleep, what's very clear

28:21.840 --> 28:24.360
 is that the sorts of learning that happen in REM sleep

28:24.360 --> 28:25.720
 are not motor events.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.120
 It's more about unlearning of emotional events.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.040
 And now we know why,

28:30.040 --> 28:31.480
 because the chemicals available

28:31.480 --> 28:36.480
 for really feeling those emotions are not present.

28:36.680 --> 28:40.880
 Now that has very important implications.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.560
 So let's address those implications from two sides.

28:43.560 --> 28:44.640
 First of all, we should ask

28:44.640 --> 28:47.380
 what happens if we don't get enough REM sleep?

28:47.380 --> 28:49.640
 And a scenario that happens a lot

28:49.640 --> 28:52.680
 where people don't get enough REM sleep is the following.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.020
 I'll just explain the one that I'm familiar with

28:55.020 --> 28:56.640
 because it happens to me a lot,

28:56.640 --> 28:59.940
 although I figured out ways to adjust.

28:59.940 --> 29:02.880
 I go to sleep around 10, 30, 11 o'clock.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.560
 I fall asleep very easily.

29:04.560 --> 29:08.480
 And then I wake up around three or 4 a.m.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.960
 I now know to use a NSDR, a non-sleep deep rest protocol.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.000
 And that allows me to fall back asleep.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.680
 Even though it's called non-sleep deep rest,

29:16.680 --> 29:19.400
 it's really allows me to relax my body and brain.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.700
 And I tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about 7 a.m.

29:22.700 --> 29:26.320
 during which time I get a lot of REM sleep.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.400
 And I know this because I've measured it.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.240
 And I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense

29:32.140 --> 29:34.600
 of the sort that we know as typical of REM sleep.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.680
 In this scenario,

29:38.620 --> 29:40.580
 I've gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night

29:40.580 --> 29:42.680
 and I've got my REM sleep toward morning.

29:43.560 --> 29:46.040
 However, there are times when I don't go back to sleep.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.000
 Maybe I have a flight to catch, that's happened.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.340
 Sometimes I've got a lot on my mind

29:49.340 --> 29:50.800
 and I don't go back to sleep.

29:51.980 --> 29:53.880
 I can tell you and you've probably experienced

29:53.880 --> 29:55.600
 that the lack of REM sleep

29:55.600 --> 29:58.500
 tends to make people emotionally irritable.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.320
 It tends to make us feel

30:00.320 --> 30:02.820
 as if the little things are the big things.

30:02.820 --> 30:05.940
 So it's very clear from laboratory studies

30:05.940 --> 30:09.560
 where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep

30:09.560 --> 30:12.960
 that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged

30:12.960 --> 30:16.040
 and we tend to catastrophize small things.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.800
 We tend to feel like the world is really daunting.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.300
 We're never going to move forward in the ways that we want.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.560
 We can't unlearn the emotional components

30:24.560 --> 30:26.520
 of whatever it is that's been happening,

30:26.520 --> 30:28.800
 even if it's not traumatic.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.540
 The other thing that happens in REM sleep

30:30.540 --> 30:34.260
 is a replay of certain types of spatial information

30:34.260 --> 30:37.360
 about where we were and why we were in those places.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.600
 And this maps to some beautiful data

30:39.600 --> 30:41.200
 and studies that were initiated

30:41.200 --> 30:44.480
 by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago

30:44.480 --> 30:45.980
 showing that in rodents,

30:45.980 --> 30:49.340
 and it turns out in other non-human primates and in humans,

30:49.340 --> 30:52.980
 there's a replay of spatial information during REM sleep

30:52.980 --> 30:56.460
 that almost precisely maps to the activity

30:56.460 --> 30:57.560
 that we experienced during the day

30:57.560 --> 30:59.260
 as we move from one place to another.

30:59.260 --> 31:00.900
 So here's a common world scenario.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.680
 You go to a new place,

31:02.680 --> 31:05.600
 you navigate through that city or that environment.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.040
 This place doesn't have to be at the scale of a city.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.280
 It can be a new building,

31:09.280 --> 31:12.960
 could be finding particular rooms, new social interaction.

31:12.960 --> 31:16.520
 You experience that and if it's important enough,

31:16.520 --> 31:19.360
 that becomes solidified a few days later

31:19.360 --> 31:20.320
 and you won't forget it.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.460
 If it's unimportant, you'll probably forget it.

31:23.460 --> 31:26.680
 During REM sleep, there's a literal replay

31:26.680 --> 31:29.640
 of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred

31:29.640 --> 31:31.480
 while you were navigating that same city

31:31.480 --> 31:32.720
 you're building earlier.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.760
 So REM sleep seems to be involved in the generation

31:35.760 --> 31:38.680
 of this detailed spatial information.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.980
 But what is it that's actually happening in REM sleep?

31:42.980 --> 31:44.880
 So there's this uncoupling of emotion,

31:44.880 --> 31:47.320
 but most of all what's happening in REM sleep

31:47.320 --> 31:49.680
 is that we're forming a relationship

31:49.680 --> 31:52.740
 with particular rules or algorithms.

31:52.740 --> 31:54.460
 We're starting to figure out

31:54.460 --> 31:57.400
 based on all the experience that we had during the day,

31:57.400 --> 31:59.320
 whether or not it's important

31:59.320 --> 32:00.560
 that we avoid certain people

32:00.560 --> 32:01.940
 or that we approach certain people.

32:01.940 --> 32:06.200
 Whether or not it's important that when we enter a building

32:06.200 --> 32:09.660
 that we go into the elevator and turn left

32:09.660 --> 32:11.140
 where the bathroom is, for instance,

32:11.140 --> 32:13.780
 these general themes of things and locations

32:13.780 --> 32:15.360
 and how they fit together.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.160
 And that has a word, it's called meaning.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.600
 During our day, we're experiencing all sorts of things.

32:20.600 --> 32:25.600
 Meaning is how we each individually piece together

32:25.800 --> 32:28.560
 the relevance of one thing to the next, right?

32:28.560 --> 32:32.320
 So if I suddenly told you that this pen

32:32.320 --> 32:34.720
 was downloading all the information to my brain

32:34.720 --> 32:36.900
 that was important to deliver this information,

32:36.900 --> 32:38.980
 you'd probably think I was a pretty strange character

32:38.980 --> 32:40.700
 because typically we don't think of pens

32:40.700 --> 32:43.040
 as downloading information into brains.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.960
 But if I told you that I was getting information

32:44.960 --> 32:49.280
 from my computer that was allowing me to say things to you,

32:49.280 --> 32:50.800
 you'd say, well, that's perfectly reasonable.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.560
 And that's because we have a clear

32:52.560 --> 32:54.780
 and agreed upon association with computers

32:54.780 --> 32:57.040
 and information and memory.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.180
 And we don't have that same association with pens.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.680
 You might say, well, duh,

33:01.680 --> 33:05.280
 but something in our brain

33:05.280 --> 33:07.360
 needs to solidify those relationships

33:07.360 --> 33:10.400
 and make sure that certain relationships don't exist.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.600
 And it appears that REM sleep is important for that

33:12.600 --> 33:16.040
 because when you deprive yourself or people of REM,

33:16.040 --> 33:18.300
 they start seeing odd associations.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.960
 They tend to lump or batch things.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.600
 I know this from my own experience,

33:22.600 --> 33:24.040
 if I've ever been sleep deprived,

33:24.040 --> 33:25.700
 which unfortunately happens too often

33:25.700 --> 33:29.640
 because I'm terrible with deadlines, pulling all nighter,

33:29.640 --> 33:33.420
 the word the starts to look like it's spelled incorrectly.

33:33.420 --> 33:36.240
 And the is a very simple word to spell,

33:36.240 --> 33:38.960
 but things start to look a little distorted.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.040
 And we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep

33:42.040 --> 33:44.840
 for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.640
 They literally start seeing relationships

33:47.640 --> 33:50.360
 and movement of objects that isn't happening.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.800
 And so REM sleep is really

33:52.800 --> 33:54.720
 where we establish the emotional load,

33:54.720 --> 33:57.120
 but where we also start discarding

33:57.120 --> 33:59.280
 of all the meanings that are irrelevant.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.360
 And if you think about emotionality,

34:01.360 --> 34:05.360
 a lot of over emotionality or catastrophizing

34:05.360 --> 34:07.920
 is about seeing problems everywhere.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.000
 And you could imagine why that might occur

34:10.000 --> 34:11.960
 if you start linking the web

34:11.960 --> 34:14.160
 of your experience too extensively.

34:14.160 --> 34:17.120
 It's very important in order to have healthy emotional

34:17.120 --> 34:18.460
 and cognitive functioning,

34:18.460 --> 34:20.400
 that we have fairly narrow channels

34:20.400 --> 34:21.580
 between individual things.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.280
 If we see something on the news that's very troubling,

34:24.280 --> 34:26.560
 well, then it makes sense to be very troubled.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.120
 But if we're troubled by everything

34:28.120 --> 34:30.560
 and we start just saying, everything is bothering me

34:30.560 --> 34:32.000
 and I'm feeling highly irritable

34:32.000 --> 34:35.160
 and everything's just distorting and troubling me,

34:35.160 --> 34:40.160
 chances are we are not actively removing the meaning,

34:40.660 --> 34:42.920
 the connectivity between life experiences

34:42.920 --> 34:43.860
 as well as we could.

34:43.860 --> 34:48.080
 And that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep.

34:48.080 --> 34:52.180
 So REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity

34:52.180 --> 34:56.360
 to eliminate the meanings that don't matter.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.580
 It's not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter,

34:59.580 --> 35:01.920
 but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.440
 And that bears a striking resemblance

35:04.440 --> 35:06.840
 to what happens early in development.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.280
 This isn't a discussion about early in development,

35:09.280 --> 35:10.240
 but early in development,

35:10.240 --> 35:13.620
 the reason a baby can't generate coordinated movements

35:13.620 --> 35:17.080
 and the reason why children can get very emotional

35:17.080 --> 35:19.000
 about what seems like trivial events

35:19.000 --> 35:20.780
 or what adults know to be trivial events,

35:20.780 --> 35:23.160
 like, oh, the ice cream shop is closed

35:23.160 --> 35:25.360
 and then the kid just dissolves

35:25.360 --> 35:28.880
 into a puddle of tears and the parents can say,

35:28.880 --> 35:31.000
 okay, well, it'll be open again another time.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.400
 The children, one of the reasons

35:33.400 --> 35:36.120
 that they can't generate coordinated movement

35:36.120 --> 35:38.920
 or place that event of the ice cream shop being closed

35:38.920 --> 35:40.540
 into a larger context

35:40.540 --> 35:42.960
 is because they have too much connectivity

35:42.960 --> 35:45.700
 and much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system

35:45.700 --> 35:48.600
 that brings us to the point of being emotionally stable,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.780
 reasonable, rational human beings

35:50.780 --> 35:54.040
 is about elimination of connections between things.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.360
 So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple

35:57.360 --> 36:02.360
 the potential for emotionality between various experiences.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.720
 And that brings us

36:03.720 --> 36:07.440
 to the absolutely fundamental relationship

36:07.440 --> 36:09.980
 and similarity of REM sleep

36:09.980 --> 36:12.560
 to some of the clinical practices

36:12.560 --> 36:15.120
 that have been designed to eliminate emotionality

36:15.120 --> 36:17.360
 and help people move through trauma

36:17.360 --> 36:19.240
 and other troubling experiences,

36:19.240 --> 36:20.860
 whether or not those troubling experiences

36:20.860 --> 36:24.160
 are a death in the family or of a close loved one,

36:24.160 --> 36:26.740
 something terrible that happened to you or somebody else,

36:26.740 --> 36:30.600
 or an entire childhood or some event

36:30.600 --> 36:33.760
 that in your mind and body is felt as

36:33.760 --> 36:37.460
 and experienced as bad, terrible or concerning.

36:37.460 --> 36:40.560
 Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatments

36:40.560 --> 36:45.560
 such as EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing

36:46.620 --> 36:49.700
 or ketamine treatment for trauma,

36:49.700 --> 36:51.680
 something that recently became legal

36:51.680 --> 36:54.440
 and is in fairly widespread clinical use.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.760
 Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine

36:59.760 --> 37:04.760
 at kind of a core level bear very similar features

37:05.100 --> 37:07.080
 to REM sleep.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.700
 So let's talk about EMDR first.

37:09.700 --> 37:12.760
 EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing

37:12.760 --> 37:13.920
 is something that was developed

37:13.920 --> 37:17.000
 by a psychologist Francine Shapiro.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.740
 She actually was in Palo Alto and the story goes

37:21.740 --> 37:26.240
 that she was walking not so incidentally

37:26.240 --> 37:29.580
 in the trees and forest behind Stanford

37:29.580 --> 37:32.580
 and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.480
 So this would be from her own life.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.680
 And she realized that as she was walking,

37:36.680 --> 37:38.720
 the emotional load of that experience

37:38.720 --> 37:41.220
 was not as intense or severe.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.620
 She extrapolated from that experience

37:46.620 --> 37:49.440
 of walking and not feeling as stressed

37:49.440 --> 37:51.960
 about the stressful event to a practice

37:51.960 --> 37:56.160
 that she put into work with her clients, with her patients

37:56.160 --> 37:58.680
 and that now has become fairly widespread.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.260
 It's actually one of the few behavior treatments

38:02.260 --> 38:04.920
 that are approved by the American Psychological Association

38:04.920 --> 38:06.320
 for the treatment of trauma.

38:08.100 --> 38:10.580
 What she had her clients and patients do

38:10.580 --> 38:13.640
 was move their eyes from side to side

38:13.640 --> 38:17.020
 while recounting some traumatic or troubling event.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.720
 Now this was of course in the clinic

38:18.720 --> 38:21.160
 and I'm guessing that she removed the walking component

38:21.160 --> 38:24.280
 and just took the eye movement component to the clinic

38:24.280 --> 38:27.960
 because while it would be nice to go on therapy sessions

38:27.960 --> 38:29.840
 with your therapist and take walks,

38:29.840 --> 38:31.960
 there are certain boundaries to that

38:31.960 --> 38:34.200
 such as confidentiality.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.520
 If there are a lot of people around,

38:35.520 --> 38:38.360
 the person might not feel as open to discussing things

38:38.360 --> 38:40.880
 or weather barriers and things like that.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.720
 If it's raining or hailing outside, it gets tough to do.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.420
 Why eye movements?

38:46.420 --> 38:49.100
 Well, she never really said why eye movements

38:49.100 --> 38:52.720
 but soon I'll tell you why the decision

38:52.720 --> 38:55.160
 to select these lateralized eye movements

38:55.160 --> 38:58.280
 for the work in the clinic was the right one.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.960
 So these eye movements, they look silly.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.080
 I'll do them because that's why I'm here.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.360
 They look silly, but they basically involve

39:07.360 --> 39:10.880
 sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side,

39:10.880 --> 39:15.140
 not while talking, but for me,

39:15.140 --> 39:17.120
 and then recounting the event.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.720
 So it's sometimes talking while moving the eyes

39:19.720 --> 39:21.640
 but usually it was moving the eyes from side to side

39:21.640 --> 39:23.140
 for 30, 60 seconds

39:23.140 --> 39:26.440
 then describing this challenging procedure.

39:26.440 --> 39:31.380
 Now, as a vision scientist who also works on stress,

39:32.460 --> 39:36.600
 when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.300
 People would ask me about EMDR

39:38.300 --> 39:40.040
 and I just thought, that's crazy.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.600
 I went and looked up some of the theories

39:41.600 --> 39:43.880
 about why EMDR might work.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.360
 And there were a bunch of theories.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.240
 Oh, it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.200
 That was one.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.080
 It turns out that's not true and I'll explain why.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.740
 The other one was, oh, it synchronizes the activity

39:55.740 --> 39:57.480
 on the two sides of the brain.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.360
 Well, sort of, I mean, when you look into both sides

40:00.360 --> 40:01.600
 of the binocular visual field,

40:01.600 --> 40:03.120
 you activate the visual cortex,

40:03.120 --> 40:05.500
 but this whole idea of synchrony

40:05.500 --> 40:06.860
 between the two sides of the brain

40:06.860 --> 40:08.640
 is something that I think modern neuroscience

40:08.640 --> 40:11.900
 is starting to, let's just say,

40:11.900 --> 40:15.160
 gently or not so gently move away from,

40:15.160 --> 40:18.880
 this whole right brain, left brain business.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.520
 It turns out, however,

40:20.520 --> 40:22.520
 that eye movements of the sort that I just did

40:22.520 --> 40:25.420
 and that Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience

40:25.420 --> 40:28.440
 and brought to her clients in the clinic

40:29.540 --> 40:31.340
 are the sorts of eye movements that you generate

40:31.340 --> 40:33.180
 whenever you're moving through space,

40:33.180 --> 40:35.520
 when you are self-generating that movement.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.840
 So not so much when you're driving a car,

40:37.840 --> 40:39.640
 but certainly if you were riding a bicycle

40:39.640 --> 40:41.680
 or you were walking or you were running,

40:41.680 --> 40:42.520
 you don't realize it

40:42.520 --> 40:44.780
 but you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements

40:44.780 --> 40:46.600
 that go from side to side

40:46.600 --> 40:49.240
 and they are associated with the motor system.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.080
 So when you move forward, your eyes go like this.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.660
 There've been a number of studies showing

40:53.660 --> 40:56.780
 that these lateralized eye movements helped people

40:56.780 --> 41:00.340
 move through or dissociate the emotional experience

41:00.340 --> 41:03.720
 of particular traumas with those experiences

41:03.720 --> 41:06.160
 such that they could recall those experiences

41:06.160 --> 41:09.400
 after the treatment and not feel stressed about them

41:09.400 --> 41:12.140
 or they didn't report them as traumatic any longer.

41:12.140 --> 41:14.080
 Now, the success rate wasn't 100%,

41:14.080 --> 41:15.660
 but they were statistically significant

41:15.660 --> 41:17.480
 in a number of studies.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.200
 And yet there are still some critics of EMDR

41:20.200 --> 41:23.040
 and frankly, for a long time, I still thought,

41:23.040 --> 41:25.420
 well, I don't know, this just seems like kind of a hack.

41:25.420 --> 41:26.920
 It just seems like kind of a,

41:26.920 --> 41:28.840
 this is something that for which we don't know the mechanism

41:28.840 --> 41:30.920
 and we can't explain.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.760
 But in the last five years,

41:33.760 --> 41:36.400
 there have been no fewer than five

41:36.400 --> 41:37.960
 and there's a sixth on the way,

41:37.960 --> 41:40.320
 high quality peer-reviewed manuscripts

41:40.320 --> 41:42.520
 published in Journal of Neuroscience,

41:42.520 --> 41:45.920
 Neuron, Cell Press Journal, Excellent Journal,

41:45.920 --> 41:48.520
 Nature, Excellent Journal.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.520
 These are very stringent journals and papers

41:51.520 --> 41:53.700
 showing that lateralized eye movements

41:53.700 --> 41:55.120
 of the sort that I just did

41:55.120 --> 41:56.160
 and if you're just listening to this,

41:56.160 --> 41:58.280
 it's just sweep that moving the eyes from side to side

41:58.280 --> 42:00.800
 with eyes open, that those eye movements,

42:00.800 --> 42:02.960
 but not vertical eye movements,

42:02.960 --> 42:06.560
 suppress the activity of the amygdala,

42:06.560 --> 42:08.720
 which is this brain region

42:08.720 --> 42:11.760
 that is involved in threat detection,

42:11.760 --> 42:14.280
 stress, anxiety, and fear.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.200
 There are some forms of fear

42:15.200 --> 42:16.540
 that are not amygdala dependent,

42:16.540 --> 42:19.260
 but the amygdala, it's not a fear center,

42:19.260 --> 42:23.560
 but it is critical for the fear response

42:23.560 --> 42:25.480
 and for the experience of anxiety.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.380
 So that's interesting.

42:26.380 --> 42:29.360
 We've got a clinical tool now

42:29.360 --> 42:32.080
 that indeed shows a lot of success

42:32.080 --> 42:33.820
 in a good number of people

42:33.820 --> 42:36.000
 where eye movements from side to side

42:36.000 --> 42:37.360
 are suppressing the amygdala

42:37.360 --> 42:40.180
 and the general theme is to use those eye movements

42:40.180 --> 42:42.120
 to suppress the fear response

42:42.120 --> 42:46.260
 and then to recount or repeat the experience

42:46.260 --> 42:50.240
 and over time uncouple the heavy emotional load,

42:50.240 --> 42:52.740
 the sadness, the depression, the anxiety, the fear

42:52.740 --> 42:56.300
 from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.000
 This is important to understand

42:58.000 --> 43:01.400
 because I'd love to be able to tell somebody

43:01.400 --> 43:02.720
 who had a traumatic experience

43:02.720 --> 43:04.640
 that they would forget that experience,

43:04.640 --> 43:07.640
 but the truth is you never forget the traumatic experience.

43:07.640 --> 43:10.040
 What you do is you remove the emotional load.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.980
 Eventually it really does lose its potency.

43:13.980 --> 43:16.600
 The emotional potency is alleviated.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.100
 Now, EMDR, I should just mention,

43:19.100 --> 43:21.780
 tends to be most successful for single event

43:21.780 --> 43:25.000
 or very specific kinds of trauma that happen over and over

43:25.000 --> 43:29.040
 as opposed to say an entire childhood or an entire divorce.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.900
 They tend to be, it tends to be most effective

43:31.900 --> 43:35.580
 for single event kinds of things, car crashes, et cetera,

43:35.580 --> 43:37.960
 where people can really recall the events

43:37.960 --> 43:39.920
 in quite a lot of detail.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.840
 So it's not for everybody and it should be done,

43:42.840 --> 43:44.400
 if it's going to be done for trauma,

43:44.400 --> 43:46.120
 it should be done in a clinical setting

43:46.120 --> 43:49.040
 with somebody who's certified to do this,

43:49.040 --> 43:52.120
 but that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep, right?

43:52.120 --> 43:56.480
 This experience in our sleep where our eyes are moving,

43:56.480 --> 43:57.900
 although in a different way,

43:57.900 --> 44:00.600
 but we don't have the chemical epinephrine

44:00.600 --> 44:02.840
 in order to generate the fear response

44:02.840 --> 44:04.840
 and yet we're remembering the event

44:04.840 --> 44:06.800
 from the previous day or days.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.740
 Sometimes in REM sleep,

44:07.740 --> 44:10.720
 we think about things that happened a long, long time ago.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.240
 So that's interesting.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.120
 And then now there's this new treatment,

44:14.120 --> 44:17.520
 this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine,

44:17.520 --> 44:20.100
 which also bears a lot of resemblance

44:20.100 --> 44:23.800
 to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.320
 Ketamine is getting a lot of attention now.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
 And I think a lot of people

44:27.320 --> 44:29.860
 just don't realize what ketamine is.

44:29.860 --> 44:33.440
 Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.

44:33.440 --> 44:38.440
 It is remarkably similar to the drug called PCP,

44:38.440 --> 44:43.440
 which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use.

44:43.960 --> 44:48.600
 Ketamine and PCP both function

44:48.600 --> 44:51.160
 to disrupt the activity of a particular receptor

44:51.160 --> 44:54.320
 in the brain called the NMDA receptor,

44:54.320 --> 44:56.820
 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

44:56.820 --> 45:00.160
 This is a receptor that's in the surface of neurons

45:00.160 --> 45:01.700
 or on the surface of neurons

45:01.700 --> 45:05.560
 for which most of the time it's not active.

45:05.560 --> 45:09.200
 But when something very extreme happens

45:09.200 --> 45:11.780
 and there's a lot of activity in the neural pathway

45:11.780 --> 45:13.840
 that impinges on that receptor,

45:13.840 --> 45:18.840
 it opens and it allows the entry of molecules, ions,

45:19.180 --> 45:22.360
 that trigger a cellular process

45:22.360 --> 45:24.840
 that we call long-term potentiation.

45:24.840 --> 45:27.040
 And long-term potentiation translates

45:27.040 --> 45:29.240
 to a change in connectivity

45:29.240 --> 45:32.200
 so that later you don't need that intense event

45:32.200 --> 45:34.800
 for the neuron to become active again.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.400
 Let me clarify a little bit of this.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.280
 The NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.040
 One way you could think about this

45:42.040 --> 45:43.760
 is typically I walk in my home,

45:43.760 --> 45:46.580
 I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table,

45:46.580 --> 45:50.920
 and I don't think anything about explosions.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.620
 But were I to come home one night,

45:52.620 --> 45:54.660
 sit down to a bowl of chicken soup,

45:54.660 --> 45:57.500
 and there was a massive explosion,

45:57.500 --> 45:59.580
 the neurons that are associated with chicken soup

45:59.580 --> 46:02.280
 in my kitchen table would be active

46:02.280 --> 46:05.640
 in a way that was different than they were previously

46:05.640 --> 46:08.700
 and would be coupled to this experience of explosions

46:08.700 --> 46:12.260
 such that the next time and perhaps every other time

46:12.260 --> 46:13.820
 that I go to sit down at the kitchen table,

46:13.820 --> 46:15.740
 no matter how rational I am

46:15.740 --> 46:17.480
 about the origins of that explosion,

46:17.480 --> 46:19.980
 maybe it was a gas truck that was down the road

46:19.980 --> 46:21.420
 and there's no reason to think it's there today,

46:21.420 --> 46:23.560
 but I would have the same experience.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.780
 Those neurons would become active

46:24.780 --> 46:26.480
 and I'd get an increase in heart rate,

46:26.480 --> 46:29.300
 I'd get an increase in sweating, et cetera.

46:29.300 --> 46:32.500
 Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor

46:32.500 --> 46:36.720
 and prevents that crossover and the addition of meaning

46:36.720 --> 46:39.440
 to the kitchen table, kitchen soup, excuse me,

46:39.440 --> 46:41.720
 chicken soup explosion experience.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.840
 So how is ketamine being used?

46:43.840 --> 46:47.920
 Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions

46:47.920 --> 46:49.840
 very soon after trauma.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.680
 So ketamine is being stocked

46:51.680 --> 46:53.220
 in a number of different emergency rooms

46:53.220 --> 46:55.620
 where if people are brought in quickly

46:55.620 --> 46:57.800
 and these are hard to describe even,

46:57.800 --> 47:01.480
 but a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one

47:01.480 --> 47:03.160
 next to them killed in a car accident

47:03.160 --> 47:05.240
 and they were driving that car,

47:05.240 --> 47:07.300
 this isn't for everybody certainly

47:07.300 --> 47:08.900
 and you need to talk to your physician,

47:08.900 --> 47:10.640
 but ketamine is being used

47:10.640 --> 47:12.860
 so they might infuse somebody with ketamine

47:12.860 --> 47:16.500
 so that their emotion is, it can still occur,

47:16.500 --> 47:18.580
 but that the plasticity,

47:18.580 --> 47:21.220
 the change in the wiring of their brain

47:21.220 --> 47:23.700
 won't allow that intense emotion

47:23.700 --> 47:25.400
 to be attached to the experience.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.720
 Now, immediately you can imagine

47:26.720 --> 47:29.220
 the sort of ethical implications of this, right?

47:29.220 --> 47:32.700
 Because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences.

47:32.700 --> 47:34.520
 I'm not saying that people should be using ketamine

47:34.520 --> 47:35.500
 or shouldn't be using ketamine,

47:35.500 --> 47:38.500
 certainly not recreationally, it's quite dangerous.

47:38.500 --> 47:41.780
 It can be lethal and like PCP,

47:41.780 --> 47:43.900
 it can cause pretty dramatic changes

47:43.900 --> 47:45.420
 in perception and behavior.

47:45.420 --> 47:47.020
 But in the clinical setting,

47:47.020 --> 47:49.980
 the basis of ketamine-assisted therapies

47:49.980 --> 47:52.500
 is really to remove emotion.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.980
 And I think the way I've been hearing about it,

47:54.980 --> 47:56.620
 talked about in the general public

47:56.620 --> 47:58.860
 is a lot of people think it's a little bit more like

47:58.860 --> 48:02.120
 the kind of psilocybin trials or the MDMA trials

48:02.120 --> 48:04.460
 where it's about becoming more emotional

48:04.460 --> 48:06.660
 or getting in touch with a certain experience.

48:06.660 --> 48:09.420
 Ketamine is about becoming dissociative

48:09.420 --> 48:12.420
 or removed from the emotional component of the experience.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.260
 So now we have ketamine,

48:14.260 --> 48:16.380
 which chemically blocks plasticity

48:16.380 --> 48:18.380
 and prevents the connection

48:18.380 --> 48:20.780
 between an emotion and an experience.

48:20.780 --> 48:22.140
 That's a pharmacologic intervention.

48:22.140 --> 48:25.320
 We have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing

48:25.320 --> 48:27.500
 that is designed to suppress the amygdala

48:27.500 --> 48:29.820
 and is designed to remove emotionality

48:29.820 --> 48:31.860
 while somebody recounts an experience.

48:31.860 --> 48:34.060
 And we have REM sleep,

48:34.060 --> 48:38.380
 where the chemical epinephrine that allows for signaling

48:38.380 --> 48:42.060
 of intense emotion and the experience of a tense emotion

48:42.060 --> 48:44.020
 in the brain and body is not allowed.

48:44.020 --> 48:47.740
 And so we're starting to see a organizational logic,

48:47.740 --> 48:50.880
 which is that a certain component of our sleeping life

48:50.880 --> 48:52.780
 is acting like therapy.

48:52.780 --> 48:55.880
 And that's really what REM sleep is about.

48:55.880 --> 48:59.080
 So we should really think about REM sleep

48:59.080 --> 49:01.360
 and slow wave sleep as both critical,

49:01.360 --> 49:03.740
 slow wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning,

49:03.740 --> 49:05.780
 REM sleep for attaching of emotions

49:05.780 --> 49:07.440
 to particular experiences,

49:07.440 --> 49:11.260
 and then for making sure that the emotions

49:11.260 --> 49:13.740
 are not attached to the wrong experiences

49:13.740 --> 49:16.320
 and for unlearning emotional responses

49:16.320 --> 49:18.580
 if they're too intense or severe.

49:18.580 --> 49:21.280
 And this all speaks to the great importance

49:21.280 --> 49:23.080
 of mastering one's sleep,

49:23.080 --> 49:24.100
 something that we talked about

49:24.100 --> 49:26.620
 in episode two of the podcast

49:26.620 --> 49:30.780
 and making sure that if life has disruptive events,

49:30.780 --> 49:35.560
 either due to travel or stress or changes in school

49:35.560 --> 49:37.140
 or food schedule,

49:37.140 --> 49:39.600
 something that we talked about in episodes three and four,

49:39.600 --> 49:44.520
 that one can still grab a hold and manage one's sleep life.

49:44.520 --> 49:48.500
 Because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions

49:48.500 --> 49:50.860
 that are troubling to us

49:50.860 --> 49:52.640
 is what allows us to move forward in life.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.900
 And indeed the REM deprivation studies show

49:54.900 --> 49:56.980
 that people become hyper-emotional,

49:56.980 --> 49:58.780
 they start to catastrophize.

49:58.780 --> 50:01.580
 And it's no surprise therefore

50:01.580 --> 50:03.980
 that sleep disturbances correlate

50:03.980 --> 50:08.180
 with so many emotional and psychological disturbances.

50:08.180 --> 50:10.980
 It's just by now it should just be obvious

50:10.980 --> 50:12.540
 why that will be the case.

50:12.540 --> 50:14.300
 In fact, the other day I was in a discussion

50:14.300 --> 50:17.480
 with a colleague of mine who's down in Australia,

50:17.480 --> 50:18.340
 Dr. Sarah McKay.

50:18.340 --> 50:20.900
 I've known her for two decades now

50:20.900 --> 50:23.300
 from the time she was at Oxford.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.620
 And Sarah studies among other things,

50:25.620 --> 50:27.020
 menopause in the brain.

50:27.020 --> 50:31.860
 And she was saying that a lot of the emotional effects

50:31.860 --> 50:34.700
 of menopause actually are not directly related

50:34.700 --> 50:35.540
 to the hormones.

50:35.540 --> 50:37.140
 There've been some really nice studies showing

50:37.140 --> 50:40.980
 that the disruptions in temperature regulation in menopause

50:40.980 --> 50:44.400
 map to changes in sleep regulation

50:44.400 --> 50:46.860
 that then impact emotionality

50:46.860 --> 50:50.540
 and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits

50:50.540 --> 50:52.220
 related to emotionality.

50:52.220 --> 50:54.020
 And I encourage you to look at her work.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.700
 We'll probably have her as a guest on the podcast

50:55.700 --> 50:56.700
 at some point in the future

50:56.700 --> 50:59.600
 because she's so knowledgeable about those sorts of issues

50:59.600 --> 51:01.560
 as well as issues related to testosterone

51:01.560 --> 51:03.440
 and in people with all sorts

51:03.440 --> 51:05.680
 of different chromosomal backgrounds.

51:05.680 --> 51:10.680
 So sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation of energy.

51:11.540 --> 51:13.820
 It's not just deprivation of immune function.

51:13.820 --> 51:17.580
 It is deprivation of self-induced therapy

51:17.580 --> 51:19.740
 every time we go to sleep, okay?

51:19.740 --> 51:23.180
 So these things like EMDR and ketamine therapies

51:23.180 --> 51:25.300
 are in clinic therapies,

51:25.300 --> 51:27.620
 but REM sleep is the one that you're giving yourself

51:27.620 --> 51:29.600
 every night when you go to sleep,

51:29.600 --> 51:32.740
 which raises I think the other important question,

51:32.740 --> 51:35.060
 which is how to get and how to know

51:35.060 --> 51:36.300
 if you're getting the appropriate amount

51:36.300 --> 51:38.140
 of REM sleep and slow wave sleep.

51:38.140 --> 51:39.900
 So that's what we'll talk about next.

51:39.900 --> 51:44.440
 So how should one go about getting the appropriate amount

51:44.440 --> 51:46.460
 of slow wave sleep and REM sleep

51:46.460 --> 51:48.980
 and knowing that you're getting the right amount?

51:48.980 --> 51:52.340
 Well, short of hooking yourself up to an EEG,

51:52.340 --> 51:55.640
 it's going to be tough to get exact measurements

51:55.640 --> 51:58.680
 of brain states from night to night.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.480
 Some people nowadays are using things

52:00.480 --> 52:02.360
 like the aura ring or a whoop band

52:02.360 --> 52:04.800
 or some other device to measure the quality

52:04.800 --> 52:06.320
 and depth and duration of their sleep.

52:06.320 --> 52:09.920
 And for many people, those devices can be quite useful.

52:10.840 --> 52:13.200
 Some people are only gauging their sleep

52:13.200 --> 52:15.880
 by way of whether or not they feel rested,

52:15.880 --> 52:17.520
 whether or not they feel like they're learning

52:17.520 --> 52:19.240
 and they're getting better or not.

52:19.240 --> 52:22.820
 There are some things that one can really do.

52:22.820 --> 52:25.280
 And the first one might surprise you

52:25.280 --> 52:26.440
 in light of everything I've said

52:26.440 --> 52:29.440
 and probably everything you've heard about sleep.

52:29.440 --> 52:33.520
 There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate,

52:33.520 --> 52:38.520
 Emily Hoagland, who was in Robert Strickgold's lab

52:38.600 --> 52:39.920
 at the time.

52:39.920 --> 52:44.920
 And that study explored how variations

52:44.920 --> 52:47.680
 in total sleep time related to learning

52:47.680 --> 52:52.680
 as compared to total sleep time itself.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.960
 And to summarize the study, what they found

52:56.960 --> 53:00.120
 was that it was more important

53:00.120 --> 53:04.720
 to have a regular amount of sleep each night

53:04.720 --> 53:08.320
 as opposed to the total duration.

53:08.320 --> 53:10.600
 In other words, and what they showed

53:10.600 --> 53:13.480
 was that improvements in learning

53:14.420 --> 53:16.500
 or deficits in learning were more related

53:16.500 --> 53:18.800
 to whether or not you got six hours, six hours,

53:18.800 --> 53:22.440
 five hours, six hours, that was better

53:22.440 --> 53:25.000
 than if somebody got, for instance,

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
 six hours, 10 hours, seven hours, four or five hours.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.320
 So you might say, well, that's crazy

53:32.320 --> 53:33.560
 because I thought we were just all supposed

53:33.560 --> 53:35.920
 to get more sleep and there's more REM towards morning.

53:35.920 --> 53:39.680
 Turns out that for sake of learning new information

53:39.680 --> 53:42.440
 and performance on exams in particular,

53:42.440 --> 53:43.640
 that's what was measured,

53:43.640 --> 53:48.640
 limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep

53:48.760 --> 53:53.100
 is at least as important and perhaps more important

53:53.100 --> 53:55.720
 than just getting more sleep overall.

53:55.720 --> 53:58.480
 And I think this will bring people great relief,

53:58.480 --> 54:01.120
 many people great relief who are struggling

54:01.120 --> 54:03.200
 to quote unquote get enough sleep.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.080
 Remember a few episodes ago,

54:05.080 --> 54:10.080
 I talked about the difference between fatigue and insomnia.

54:10.360 --> 54:13.080
 Fatigue tends to be when we are tired,

54:13.080 --> 54:16.480
 insomnia tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day

54:16.480 --> 54:18.880
 when we're falling asleep and you don't want that,

54:18.880 --> 54:21.120
 you don't want either of those things really.

54:21.120 --> 54:25.560
 But I found it striking that the data from this study

54:25.560 --> 54:28.440
 really point to the fact that consistently getting

54:28.440 --> 54:31.280
 about the same amount of sleep

54:31.280 --> 54:33.940
 is better than just getting more sleep.

54:33.940 --> 54:35.160
 And I think nowadays so many people

54:35.160 --> 54:36.720
 are just aiming for more sleep

54:36.720 --> 54:38.320
 and they're rather troubled about the fact

54:38.320 --> 54:40.060
 that they're only getting five hours

54:40.060 --> 54:43.240
 or they're only getting six hours in some cases.

54:44.460 --> 54:46.520
 It may be the case that they are sleep deprived

54:46.520 --> 54:47.960
 and they need more sleep,

54:47.960 --> 54:50.180
 but some people just have a lower sleep need.

54:50.180 --> 54:53.400
 And I find great relief personally in the fact

54:53.400 --> 54:57.100
 that consistently getting for me about six hours

54:57.100 --> 54:59.860
 or six and a half hours is going to be more beneficial

54:59.860 --> 55:01.880
 than constantly striving for eight or nine

55:01.880 --> 55:03.680
 and finding that some nights I'm getting five

55:03.680 --> 55:06.600
 and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the mean.

55:06.600 --> 55:09.720
 As I recall and I think I'm going to get this precisely right

55:09.720 --> 55:12.000
 but if not, I know that I'm at least close

55:12.000 --> 55:15.400
 for every hour variation in sleep,

55:15.400 --> 55:17.400
 regardless of whether or not it was more sleep

55:17.400 --> 55:19.240
 than one typically got,

55:19.240 --> 55:23.440
 there was a 17% reduction in performance

55:23.440 --> 55:25.880
 on this particular exam type.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.660
 And so this is powerful.

55:27.660 --> 55:29.200
 This means that we should strive

55:29.200 --> 55:31.680
 for a regular amount of sleep.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.620
 And for some of us, that means falling asleep

55:33.620 --> 55:34.920
 and waking up and going back to sleep.

55:34.920 --> 55:36.760
 For some people it means falling asleep

55:36.760 --> 55:39.720
 and waking up and not getting back to sleep.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.560
 Now, ideally you're getting the full compliment

55:42.560 --> 55:44.580
 of slow wave sleep early at night

55:44.580 --> 55:46.840
 and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep,

55:46.840 --> 55:49.560
 which brings us to how to get more REM sleep.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.760
 Well, there are a couple of different ways,

55:51.760 --> 55:56.760
 but here's how to not get more REM sleep.

55:57.060 --> 55:59.560
 First of all, drink a lot of fluid

55:59.560 --> 56:00.880
 right before going to sleep.

56:00.880 --> 56:02.320
 One of the reasons why we wake up

56:02.320 --> 56:04.200
 in the middle of the night to use the bathroom

56:04.200 --> 56:06.880
 is because when our bladder is full,

56:06.880 --> 56:08.480
 there is a neural connection,

56:08.480 --> 56:10.840
 literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit

56:10.840 --> 56:13.760
 that goes to the brainstem that wakes us up.

56:13.760 --> 56:17.600
 And actually some people that I know

56:17.600 --> 56:19.480
 and I won't be mentioned actually use this

56:19.480 --> 56:21.380
 to try and adjust for their jet lag

56:21.380 --> 56:22.320
 when they're trying to stay awake.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.600
 Having to use the bathroom, having to urinate

56:24.600 --> 56:27.680
 is one of the most anxiety evoking experiences

56:27.680 --> 56:28.560
 anyone can have.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.160
 If you really have to go to the bathroom,

56:30.160 --> 56:32.540
 it's very hard to fall asleep or stay asleep.

56:32.540 --> 56:36.840
 And bedwetting, which happens in kids very early on

56:36.840 --> 56:41.280
 is a failure of those circuits to mature

56:41.280 --> 56:44.320
 until I think we all assume that babies

56:44.320 --> 56:45.960
 are going to pee in their sleep,

56:45.960 --> 56:48.160
 but adults aren't supposed to do that.

56:48.160 --> 56:51.280
 And the circuits take some time to develop

56:51.280 --> 56:52.200
 and in some kids they develop

56:52.200 --> 56:53.920
 a little bit later than others.

56:53.920 --> 56:57.700
 So having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep.

56:57.700 --> 57:00.400
 You don't want to go to bed dehydrated, but that's one way.

57:00.400 --> 57:03.400
 On the other hand, there is evidence

57:03.400 --> 57:05.960
 that if you want to remember your dreams more

57:05.960 --> 57:08.800
 or remember more of your dreams,

57:08.800 --> 57:10.480
 there is a tool that you can use.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.120
 I don't necessarily recommend it,

57:12.120 --> 57:14.480
 which is to drink a bunch of water before you go to sleep.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.480
 And then what happens is you tend to break

57:16.480 --> 57:17.920
 in and out of REM sleep.

57:17.920 --> 57:19.440
 It tends to be fractured.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.640
 And with a sleep journal,

57:21.640 --> 57:23.140
 then they've done these laboratory studies,

57:23.140 --> 57:24.120
 believe it or not,

57:24.120 --> 57:26.000
 people will recall more of their dreams

57:26.000 --> 57:27.920
 because they're in this kind of semi-conscious state

57:27.920 --> 57:30.280
 because they're constantly waking up throughout the night.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.740
 I suggest not having a full bladder before you go to sleep.

57:32.740 --> 57:36.220
 That one's kind of an obvious one, but nonetheless.

57:36.220 --> 57:39.940
 The other one is if you recall that during REM sleep,

57:39.940 --> 57:42.420
 we have a shift in neurotransmitters

57:42.420 --> 57:47.420
 such that we have less serotonin, right?

57:49.200 --> 57:50.280
 Just want to make sure I got that right.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.840
 Excuse me, less serotonin.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.820
 There are a lot of supplements out there

57:55.820 --> 57:58.200
 geared toward improving sleep.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.520
 I've taken some of them

57:59.520 --> 58:00.720
 and I'm taking many of them,

58:00.720 --> 58:03.120
 if not all of them at this point,

58:03.120 --> 58:04.720
 so I could report back to you.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.400
 And I think I mentioned on a previous episode

58:06.400 --> 58:07.720
 that when I take tryptophan

58:07.720 --> 58:09.720
 or anything that contains 5-HTP,

58:09.720 --> 58:13.840
 which is serotonin or a precursor to serotonin,

58:13.840 --> 58:15.720
 serotonin is made from tryptophan,

58:15.720 --> 58:17.440
 I tend to fall very deeply asleep

58:17.440 --> 58:19.200
 and then wake up a few hours later.

58:19.200 --> 58:21.080
 And that makes sense now based on the fact

58:21.080 --> 58:24.160
 that you just don't want a lot of REM sleep early on.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.120
 What was probably happening

58:25.120 --> 58:27.000
 is that I was getting a lot of REM sleep early on

58:27.000 --> 58:28.540
 because low levels of serotonin

58:28.540 --> 58:31.740
 are typically associated with slow wave sleep

58:31.740 --> 58:33.200
 and that comes early in the night.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.320
 So for some people, those supplements might work,

58:35.320 --> 58:37.920
 but beware serotonin supplements

58:39.040 --> 58:42.720
 could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow wave sleep.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.660
 And in my case, led to waking up

58:44.660 --> 58:46.220
 very shortly after going to sleep

58:46.220 --> 58:48.700
 and not being able to get back to sleep.

58:48.700 --> 58:52.360
 Now, if you want to increase your slow wave sleep,

58:52.360 --> 58:53.460
 that's interesting.

58:53.460 --> 58:54.840
 There are ways to do that.

58:54.840 --> 58:58.200
 One of the most powerful ways to increase slow wave sleep,

58:58.200 --> 58:59.920
 the percentage of slow wave sleep,

59:00.900 --> 59:02.360
 apparently without any disruption

59:02.360 --> 59:05.680
 to the other components of sleep and learning

59:05.680 --> 59:08.400
 is to engage in resistance exercise.

59:08.400 --> 59:10.600
 It's pretty clear that resistance exercise

59:10.600 --> 59:13.360
 triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways

59:13.360 --> 59:16.440
 that lend themselves to release of growth hormone,

59:16.440 --> 59:18.680
 which happens early in the night.

59:18.680 --> 59:21.080
 And resistance exercise therefore

59:21.080 --> 59:24.640
 can induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.400
 It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bedtime.

59:27.400 --> 59:29.360
 In fact, for some people that the exercise

59:29.360 --> 59:30.200
 could be disruptive

59:30.200 --> 59:32.680
 for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes,

59:32.680 --> 59:35.920
 but resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise

59:35.920 --> 59:38.240
 does seem to increase the amount of slow wave sleep,

59:38.240 --> 59:41.480
 which as we know is involved in motor learning

59:41.480 --> 59:44.280
 and the acquisition of fine detailed information,

59:44.280 --> 59:48.100
 not general rules or the emotional components of experiences.

59:49.060 --> 59:52.340
 For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming

59:52.340 --> 59:54.960
 and would like to increase the amount of lucid dreaming

59:54.960 --> 59:56.480
 that you're experiencing,

59:56.480 --> 59:58.560
 I haven't been able to track down that device

59:58.560 --> 1:00:01.360
 with the red light that I described at the beginning,

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:05.760
 but there are a number of just simple zero technology tools

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:07.720
 that one could use in principle.

1:00:07.720 --> 1:00:10.040
 One is to set a cue.

1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:13.960
 The way this works is you come up with a simple statement

1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:17.060
 about something that you'd like to see

1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:19.640
 or experience later in dreams.

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:24.800
 You can, for instance, write down, you know,

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:29.040
 something like, I want to remember the red apple.

1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:30.980
 I know it sounds silly and trivial.

1:00:30.980 --> 1:00:32.440
 And you look at that,

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.180
 you would probably want to write it down

1:00:34.180 --> 1:00:35.020
 on a piece of paper.

1:00:35.020 --> 1:00:36.800
 You might even want to draw a red apple.

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:39.480
 And then before you go to sleep, you would look at it.

1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:41.780
 And then you would just go to sleep.

1:00:41.780 --> 1:00:44.000
 There are some reports that doing that

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.840
 for several days in a row can lead to a situation

1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:49.420
 in which you are suddenly in your dream

1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:51.120
 and you remember the red apple.

1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:53.940
 And that gives you a sort of tether to reality

1:00:53.940 --> 1:00:55.320
 between the dream state and reality

1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:57.220
 that allows you to navigate and shape

1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.080
 and kind of adjust your dreams.

1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:00.920
 Lucid dreaming does not have to be

1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:04.540
 or include the ability to alter features of the dream,

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.700
 you know, to be able to control things in the dream.

1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:10.280
 Sometimes it's just the awareness that you are dreaming.

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:13.600
 But nonetheless, some people enjoy lucid dreaming.

1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:15.880
 And then for people that have a lot of lucid dreams

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:18.900
 that feel kind of overwhelmed by those,

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:23.900
 that's going to involve trying to embrace protocols

1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:27.040
 that can set the right duration of sleep.

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:29.180
 There's a little bit of literature, not a lot,

1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:33.960
 that shows that keeping the total amount of sleep per night

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:37.780
 to say six hours such that you begin sleep

1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:39.480
 and end at the beginning and end

1:01:39.480 --> 1:01:41.780
 of one of these ultradian cycles

1:01:41.780 --> 1:01:43.080
 can be better than waking up

1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:45.080
 in the middle of one of these ultradian cycles.

1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:49.080
 So try and find the right amount of sleep that you need

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:50.080
 that's right for you

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:52.320
 and then try and get that consistently night to night.

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:55.040
 If you're a lucid dreamer and you don't like it,

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.920
 then you may want to start to make sure

1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.080
 that you're waking up at the end

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.440
 of one of these ultradian cycles.

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.560
 So in this case, it would be better

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:05.920
 to wake up after six hours than after seven.

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.060
 And if you did sleep longer than six hours,

1:02:08.060 --> 1:02:09.880
 maybe you'd want to get to seven and a half hours

1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:11.280
 because that's going to reflect the end

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:12.620
 of one of these 90 minute cycles

1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:15.560
 as opposed to waking up in the middle.

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:18.780
 Alcohol, alcohol and marijuana are well known

1:02:18.780 --> 1:02:21.920
 to induce states that are pseudo sleep-like,

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:24.240
 especially when people fall asleep

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:27.400
 after having consumed alcohol or THC,

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:28.800
 the active component,

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:31.620
 one of the active components in marijuana.

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:36.620
 Alcohol, THC, and most things like them,

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:41.680
 meaning things that increase serotonin or GABA

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.720
 are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep.

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:44.920
 They're going to disrupt the depth.

1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:47.180
 They're going to disrupt the overall sequencing

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:48.840
 of more slow wave sleep early in the night

1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:50.500
 and more REM sleep later in the night.

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.240
 That's just the reality.

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.160
 There are some things that,

1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:57.520
 at least in a few studies that I could find,

1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:00.120
 seem to suggest that you could increase

1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.320
 the amount of slow wave sleep using things like arginine,

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:04.920
 the amino acid arginine,

1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:06.160
 although you really want to check arginine

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:07.920
 can have effects on heart, et cetera,

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.280
 has other effects.

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:11.720
 But alcohol, THC,

1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:13.680
 not going to be great for sleep and depth of sleep.

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.560
 You might feel like you can fall asleep faster,

1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:17.360
 but the sleep that you're accessing

1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:19.500
 really isn't the kind of deep restorative sleep

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:21.900
 that you should be getting.

1:03:21.900 --> 1:03:24.960
 Now, of course, if that's what you need in order to sleep

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.360
 and that's within your protocols,

1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:27.180
 I've said here before,

1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:28.420
 I'm not suggesting people take anything.

1:03:28.420 --> 1:03:29.840
 I'm not a medical doctor.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:30.680
 I'm not a cop.

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.560
 So I'm not trying to regulate anyone's behavior.

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:36.480
 I'm just telling you what the literature says.

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:38.800
 Some of you may want to explore your dreams

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.600
 and meaning of dreams, et cetera.

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:43.940
 There's not a lot of hard data about how to do this,

1:03:43.940 --> 1:03:47.220
 but a lot of people report keeping a sleep journal

1:03:47.220 --> 1:03:49.280
 where a dream journal can be very useful.

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:51.320
 So they mark when they think they fell asleep

1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:53.200
 the night before, when they woke up.

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.320
 And if they wake up in the middle of the night,

1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:56.140
 early in the morning,

1:03:56.140 --> 1:03:58.880
 they'll just write down what they can recall

1:03:58.880 --> 1:03:59.720
 of their dreams.

1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:01.880
 And even if they recall nothing,

1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:04.600
 many people have the experience of mid-morning

1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:07.160
 or later afternoon that suddenly comes to them

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:10.120
 that they had a dream about something and writing that down.

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:11.840
 I kept a dream journal for a while.

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:13.300
 It didn't really afford me much.

1:04:13.300 --> 1:04:14.920
 I didn't really learn anything

1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:17.000
 except that my dreams were very bizarre.

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:21.060
 But there are some things that happen in dreams

1:04:21.060 --> 1:04:22.840
 that are associated with REM sleep

1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:24.300
 as it compared to slow wave sleep,

1:04:24.300 --> 1:04:26.120
 which can tell you whether or not your dream

1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:28.920
 likely happened in REM sleep or slow wave sleep.

1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:30.840
 And the distinguishing feature it turns out

1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:32.920
 is something called theory of mind.

1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:35.720
 Theory of mind is actually an idea that was developed

1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:38.460
 for the study and assessment of autism.

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:42.500
 And it was initially that phrase theory of mind

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:47.000
 was brought about by Simon Baron Cohen,

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.500
 who is Sasha Baron Cohen, the comedian's brother.

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:54.480
 Simon Baron Cohen is a psychologist

1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:58.460
 and to some extent a neuroscientist at Oxford.

1:04:58.460 --> 1:05:01.860
 And theory of mind tests are done on children.

1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:05.220
 And the theory of mind test is somewhat like the following.

1:05:05.220 --> 1:05:07.440
 A child is brought into a laboratory

1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:10.040
 and watches a video of a child

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:11.840
 playing with some sort of toy.

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:14.520
 And then at the end of playing with that toy,

1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:17.120
 they put the toy in a drawer and they go away.

1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:21.480
 And then another child comes in and is looking around.

1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:24.800
 And then the experimenter asks the child

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:27.240
 who's in the experiment, the real child,

1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:30.800
 and says, what does the child think?

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:32.120
 What are they feeling?

1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:35.500
 And most children of a particular age,

1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:37.640
 five or six or older will say,

1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:40.400
 oh, you know, he or she is confused.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:41.580
 They don't know where the toy is.

1:05:41.580 --> 1:05:43.280
 Or they'll say something that implies

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:44.720
 what we call theory of mind,

1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:48.640
 that they can put their ideas and their mind

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:51.480
 into what the other child is likely to be feeling

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:52.320
 or experiencing.

1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:53.720
 That's theory of mind.

1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:57.280
 And it turns out that this is used

1:05:57.280 --> 1:05:59.880
 as one of the assessments for autism

1:05:59.880 --> 1:06:02.320
 because some children, not all,

1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:04.600
 but some children that have autism

1:06:04.600 --> 1:06:05.940
 or that go on to develop autism

1:06:05.940 --> 1:06:07.620
 don't have this theory of mind.

1:06:07.620 --> 1:06:10.000
 They tend to fixate on the fact

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.080
 that the first child put the toy in the drawer.

1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:13.680
 They'll say it's in the drawer

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:15.580
 as opposed to answering the question,

1:06:15.580 --> 1:06:18.240
 which is how does the second child feel about it

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:20.580
 or what are they experiencing?

1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:24.220
 So theory of mind is something that emerges early in life

1:06:24.220 --> 1:06:27.080
 as a part of the maturation of the circuits in the brain

1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:29.760
 associated with emotional learning

1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:31.900
 and social interactions.

1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:35.440
 And we experience this in certain dreams.

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:38.420
 So if you had a dream that you're puzzled about

1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:40.740
 or that you're fixated on and you're thinking about,

1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:42.960
 you might ask, in that dream,

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:46.440
 was I assessing somebody else's emotion and feeling

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:49.680
 or was I very much in my own first person experience?

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:53.260
 And the tendency is that theory of mind

1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:58.260
 tends to show up most in these REM associated dreams.

1:06:58.260 --> 1:07:00.440
 Now, this isn't a hard and fast rule,

1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:02.420
 but chances are if you were in a dream

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:04.420
 and you were thinking about other people

1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.040
 who wanted to do something to you,

1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:09.040
 you were thinking about their desire to chase you

1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:12.660
 or help you or something that was related

1:07:12.660 --> 1:07:14.340
 to someone else's emotional experience,

1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:17.400
 it was probably a REM dream.

1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:19.580
 That dream occurred in rapid eye movement sleep

1:07:19.580 --> 1:07:21.620
 as opposed to slow wave sleep.

1:07:21.620 --> 1:07:24.720
 And that makes sense when you think about the role of REM

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:28.720
 in emotional unlearning of associations

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.060
 with particular life events,

1:07:30.060 --> 1:07:33.920
 that REM is rich with all sorts of exploration

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:37.720
 of the emotional load of being chased

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:40.840
 or the emotional load of having to take an exam the next day

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:42.560
 or being late for something.

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.400
 But again, if you're fixated

1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:48.200
 or you can recall thinking a lot about

1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:51.760
 or feeling a lot about what somebody else's motivations were

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:53.680
 then chances are it was in REM.

1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:56.720
 And if not, chances are it was in slow wave sleep.

1:07:56.720 --> 1:08:01.720
 Today, we've been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming,

1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:03.780
 learning and unlearning.

1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:06.120
 And I just want to recap a few of the highlights

1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:08.340
 and important points.

1:08:08.340 --> 1:08:11.440
 A lot more slow wave sleep and less REM early in the night,

1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:14.960
 more REM and less slow wave sleep later in the night.

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:18.840
 REM sleep is associated with intense experiences

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:20.920
 without this chemical epinephrine

1:08:20.920 --> 1:08:23.620
 that allows us the anxiety or fear

1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:26.080
 and almost certainly has an important role

1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:29.600
 in uncoupling of emotion from experiences,

1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:33.040
 kind of self-induced therapy that we go into each night.

1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:36.120
 That bears striking resemblance to things like EMDR

1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:38.640
 and ketamine therapies and so forth.

1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:41.800
 Slow wave sleep is critical however,

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:43.660
 it's critical mostly for motor learning

1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:45.740
 and the learning of specific details.

1:08:45.740 --> 1:08:49.460
 So REM is kind of emotions and general themes

1:08:49.460 --> 1:08:53.760
 and meaning and slow wave sleep, motor learning and details.

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:58.400
 I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep,

1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:01.000
 meaning getting six hours every night

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.080
 is better than getting 10 one night, eight the next,

1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:06.520
 five the next, four the next.

1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:09.260
 I find that fascinating and I think I also like it

1:09:09.260 --> 1:09:11.000
 because it's something I can control better

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.160
 than just trying to sleep more,

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:14.280
 which I think I'm not alone in agreeing

1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.680
 that that's just hard for a lot of people to do.

1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:20.640
 This episode also brings us to the conclusion

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:24.820
 of a five episode streak where we've been focusing on sleep

1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:28.020
 and transitions in and out of sleep, non-sleep depressed.

1:09:28.020 --> 1:09:30.580
 We've talked about a lot of tools, morning light,

1:09:30.580 --> 1:09:34.980
 evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers, supplements,

1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:38.060
 tools for measuring sleep duration and quality.

1:09:38.060 --> 1:09:40.580
 We've been covering a lot of themes.

1:09:40.580 --> 1:09:42.540
 I like to think that by now you're armed

1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:45.480
 with a number of tools and information,

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:48.060
 things like knowing when your temperature minimum is,

1:09:48.060 --> 1:09:50.100
 knowing when you might want to view light or not,

1:09:50.100 --> 1:09:52.300
 when you might want to eat or take hot showers

1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:54.080
 or God forbid, a cold shower,

1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:55.700
 something that most people, including me,

1:09:55.700 --> 1:09:58.460
 more or less loathe but can have certain benefits.

1:09:58.460 --> 1:10:01.240
 And that will allow you to shape your sleep life

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:04.460
 and get this consistent or more or less consistent amount

1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:06.060
 of sleep on a regular basis.

1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:07.300
 Nobody's perfect.

1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:08.900
 In fact, I have this little joke

1:10:08.900 --> 1:10:10.560
 that I sometimes tell it's not funny.

1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:13.220
 Like most of the jokes I tell, I'm told they're not funny,

1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:16.140
 but there's so much excitement now about intermittent

1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:17.020
 fasting.

1:10:17.020 --> 1:10:19.020
 Sometimes I think that someone should start something

1:10:19.020 --> 1:10:20.580
 on intermittent sleep deprivation,

1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:22.460
 although we're already doing that.

1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:26.100
 We are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to time.

1:10:26.100 --> 1:10:28.400
 And I don't think we should catastrophize that too much.

1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:31.040
 I think that what we want to do rather than accumulate

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:35.660
 a sleep anxiety is to, if we get a bad night's sleep,

1:10:35.660 --> 1:10:38.540
 we want to adjust, we want to get back on track

1:10:38.540 --> 1:10:40.500
 and just get the consistent amount of sleep,

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:42.340
 use those non-sleep deep rest protocols

1:10:42.340 --> 1:10:44.380
 to help us relax when we're feeling anxious,

1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:46.940
 we're having trouble waking up in the middle of the night.

1:10:46.940 --> 1:10:48.380
 There are a lot of tools out there

1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:50.680
 and most of them are zero cost.

1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:53.460
 And so I hope you'll find those beneficial.

1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:55.460
 If you've been hearing Costello snoring

1:10:55.460 --> 1:10:59.380
 throughout this episode, I apologize on his behalf.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:01.420
 As I said in the welcome video to this podcast,

1:11:01.420 --> 1:11:03.060
 he's an integral part of the podcast.

1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:03.900
 A few people have said,

1:11:03.900 --> 1:11:07.200
 hey, that noise in the background is really disruptive.

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:09.520
 Hey, what can I say?

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:12.800
 Costello is a 10 year old bulldog mastiff.

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:15.580
 The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years.

1:11:15.580 --> 1:11:17.900
 So I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,

1:11:17.900 --> 1:11:20.500
 but after he's gone, there won't be any snoring,

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:22.080
 although I'll probably get a different dog.

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:24.860
 So sort of a, what would the kids say?

1:11:24.860 --> 1:11:26.820
 Sorry, not sorry.

1:11:26.820 --> 1:11:29.060
 Sorry, not sorry about the snoring.

1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:31.020
 And I'm sorry if it's disruptive genuinely,

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:34.080
 but he's here for the haul.

1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.080
 So that's what that's about.

1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:40.240
 As we close out this segment on sleep,

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.320
 we are moving into a new theme and topic

1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:44.400
 for the next four to five episodes.

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:46.580
 We are going to discuss the science

1:11:46.580 --> 1:11:50.060
 and the tools related to neuroplasticity.

1:11:50.060 --> 1:11:52.840
 Neuroplasticity is a remarkable feature

1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:54.040
 of the nervous system.

1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:56.840
 In fact, it's the defining feature of the nervous system,

1:11:56.840 --> 1:11:59.480
 which is its ability to change itself

1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:01.120
 in response to experience.

1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:03.680
 That is unlike every other tissue

1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:06.480
 and collection of cells and organ in our body.

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:09.320
 It's really what makes us as a species

1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:12.260
 and it's what makes us as individuals.

1:12:12.260 --> 1:12:14.700
 And it's really where our potential lies.

1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:17.400
 Everything that we know, everything we can do

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:20.180
 and our true potential in terms of what we will ever

1:12:20.180 --> 1:12:23.120
 be able to know, do, say in life

1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:27.200
 is set by the limits of neuroplasticity.

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:29.740
 So we're going to explore learning in childhood,

1:12:29.740 --> 1:12:30.980
 learning in adulthood.

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:33.740
 We're going to discuss detailed protocols

1:12:33.740 --> 1:12:37.140
 as they relate to sensory plasticity,

1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:40.080
 learning new sensory information versus motor plasticity

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:42.160
 or sensory motor integration.

1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:44.280
 We're going to talk about language acquisition.

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:47.040
 We're going to be talking about emotional acquisition

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:49.520
 and breadth, as well as I think a topic

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:51.320
 a lot of people are going to find fascinating

1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:54.560
 is the relationship between plasticity set

1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:57.720
 during childhood attachment to parent or other caregiver

1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:01.160
 and how that maps onto adult relationships.

1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:02.840
 Now there's many of you have probably heard

1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:05.000
 about secure attached or insecure attached

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.520
 the A, B and C babies as they're called

1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:10.960
 from the classic studies of Bowlby and others.

1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:13.320
 But now there's actual neuroscience that can say

1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:15.260
 which circuits were active

1:13:15.260 --> 1:13:17.120
 during those early life attachment

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:22.120
 and how those map to adult attachment styles, challenges

1:13:22.620 --> 1:13:25.380
 and what makes us more likely to select certain partners

1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:26.920
 and styles of attachment

1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:28.200
 as well as how to change those.

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:29.600
 It's really fascinating.

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:32.680
 And I think neurosciences time has come

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:34.580
 for neuroplasticity.

1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:35.920
 We're also going to talk of course

1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:39.040
 about supplements and chemicals and machines and devices

1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:42.960
 that can assist in speeding up the plasticity process

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.480
 or believe it or not, there are some cases

1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:46.640
 where you might want to delay plasticity

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.920
 in order to get more depth of learning

1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:51.240
 and have that learning last longer.

1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:54.720
 Something that is just absolutely spectacular literature.

1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:57.280
 So I'm very excited to move on to that topic soon.

1:13:57.280 --> 1:13:59.200
 I hope that the tools that you've acquired so far

1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:00.680
 and the knowledge that you've acquired so far

1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:03.160
 is helping you with your self evaluation

1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:04.920
 and experimentation as you see fit

1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:06.880
 and is allowing you to not just sleep better

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.520
 but feel better while you're awake

1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:11.640
 and hopefully has set the stage for you to learn better

1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:16.200
 as we start to march into the month on neuroplasticity.

1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:18.480
 Many of you have asked how you can help support

1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:19.800
 the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:22.620
 and we greatly appreciate the question.

1:14:22.620 --> 1:14:24.980
 You can help support the podcast by subscribing

1:14:24.980 --> 1:14:27.360
 to the YouTube channel if you haven't already

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:31.120
 and leaving comments and questions in the comment section.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:34.180
 If you could subscribe on Apple and or Spotify,

1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:37.680
 that's helpful and there's a place on Apple Podcast

1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:41.680
 to leave a rating as well as comments

1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:44.080
 about how you feel about the podcast.

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.020
 If you could suggest the podcast to friends and coworkers

1:14:47.020 --> 1:14:48.560
 and anyone else that you think would benefit

1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:49.760
 from the information,

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:52.120
 that also really helps us get the word out.

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:54.480
 And of course, check out our sponsors

1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:56.600
 because that's a very direct way to help us continue

1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:58.940
 to get this information out to the general public.

1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:00.520
 Many of you have asked about supplements

1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:03.300
 and where I personally get my supplements.

1:15:03.300 --> 1:15:04.680
 I've partnered with Thorne

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:06.200
 and I get my supplements from Thorne

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:07.760
 because by my view,

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:09.860
 they have the highest level of stringency

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:13.640
 and precision in terms of what's in the bottle.

1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:16.320
 And they also have very, very high quality standards.

1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:17.800
 They're partnered with the Mayo Clinic

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.500
 and all the major sports organizations.

1:15:20.500 --> 1:15:22.360
 If you want to try Thorne supplements,

1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:24.480
 you can go to Thorne.com.

1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:27.720
 So that's Thorne spelled T-H-O-R-N-E.com

1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:31.040
 slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:32.240
 And if you do that,

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:34.640
 you can see the formulations that I take

1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:37.800
 and you'll also get 20% off, not just those formulations,

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:39.780
 but anything that Thorne makes.

1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:44.240
 That's Thorne.com slash U slash Huberman

1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:47.420
 to get 20% off anything that they provide.

1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:49.280
 Last but not least,

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.840
 a few people wrote to me with some questions

1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:55.820
 slash corrections about things that I said

1:15:55.820 --> 1:15:57.120
 in previous podcasts.

1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.360
 So in keeping with my goal

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:02.560
 of making the information accurate and clear,

1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:04.460
 I just want to correct myself

1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:06.000
 about a few things that I said.

1:16:06.860 --> 1:16:07.720
 One of those,

1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:10.080
 and I'm guessing it probably came from an endocrinologist

1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:13.440
 or somebody else that knows a lot about testicles,

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.620
 said, Huberman, you mentioned that testosterone

1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:19.800
 is made by the Sertoli cells of the testes,

1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:22.820
 and it's not, it's made by the Leydig cells of the testes,

1:16:22.820 --> 1:16:24.500
 and indeed you are correct.

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:27.440
 And so I want to make sure that I clarify that.

1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.160
 Testosterone is made by the Leydig cells of the testes,

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:31.440
 not by the Sertoli cells.

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:35.400
 The Sertoli cells make 5-alpha reductase and aromatase

1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:37.960
 and some other enzymes involved in conversion of testosterone

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.700
 into things like DHT and estrogen.

1:16:40.700 --> 1:16:42.020
 So thank you for that correction.

1:16:42.020 --> 1:16:43.180
 I genuinely appreciate it.

1:16:43.180 --> 1:16:44.680
 I misspoke.

1:16:44.680 --> 1:16:46.960
 The other thing I said was at one point I said,

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:49.340
 typical temperature is 96.8

1:16:49.340 --> 1:16:52.020
 when I actually meant to say 98.6.

1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:54.600
 So it was a dyslexic slip on my part.

1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:55.760
 And I apologize.

1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.760
 I don't know that I'm dyslexic.

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.880
 I know I'm being clinically diagnosed with dyslexia,

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:02.120
 but I swapped them,

1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:04.620
 which sometimes happens when I'm going fast.

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.200
 So I apologize.

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:08.060
 I'll use this as a moment to just say

1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:10.960
 temperature varies a lot across the day and night.

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:13.120
 That was a theme of previous podcasts.

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:16.240
 So we can't really talk about average temperature anyway,

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:18.120
 but I do want to be clear that most people think

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:21.240
 about average temperature as 98.6.

1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:24.520
 I misspoke my error and I apologize.

1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:26.960
 Thank you for joining me in this journey

1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:29.040
 of the nervous system and biology

1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:31.540
 and trying to understand the mechanisms

1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:33.720
 that make us who we are and how we function

1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:36.080
 in sleep and in wakefulness.

1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:39.140
 It's really an incredible landscape to consider.

1:17:39.140 --> 1:17:40.480
 And I hope that you're getting a lot

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:41.920
 out of the information.

1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:44.640
 As always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:46.640
 I'll see you next time.
