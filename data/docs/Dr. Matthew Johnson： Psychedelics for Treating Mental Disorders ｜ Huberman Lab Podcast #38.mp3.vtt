00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.320
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.000
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.000 --> 00:15.040
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.700
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing

00:16.700 --> 00:18.720
 Dr. Matthew Johnson.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.800
 Dr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry

00:20.800 --> 00:22.940
 at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,

00:22.940 --> 00:25.160
 where he also directs the Center for Psychedelic

00:25.160 --> 00:27.280
 and Consciousness Research.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.520
 As many of you know,

00:28.520 --> 00:31.360
 there's extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics

00:31.360 --> 00:33.980
 for the treatment of various disorders of the mind.

00:33.980 --> 00:37.000
 Dr. Johnson's laboratory is among the premier laboratories

00:37.000 --> 00:40.240
 in the world understanding how these compounds work,

00:40.240 --> 00:44.280
 how things like psilocybin and LSD and related compounds

00:44.280 --> 00:47.800
 allow neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and change

00:47.800 --> 00:51.600
 such that people can combat diseases like depression

00:51.600 --> 00:53.960
 or trauma or other disorders of the mind

00:53.960 --> 00:55.840
 that cause tremendous suffering.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.120
 Dr. Johnson is also an expert in understanding

00:58.120 --> 01:00.120
 how different types of drugs impact

01:00.120 --> 01:02.040
 different types of human behaviors,

01:02.040 --> 01:05.600
 such as sexual behavior, risk-taking, and crime.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.520
 Dr. Johnson and his work have also been featured prominently

01:08.520 --> 01:10.000
 in the popular press,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.080
 such as articles in the New York Times

01:12.080 --> 01:14.200
 and Michael Pollan's book, How to Change Your Mind,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.960
 and in a feature in 60 Minutes about psychedelics

01:16.960 --> 01:20.080
 and the new emerging science of psychedelic therapies

01:20.080 --> 01:22.400
 for treating mental disorders.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.520
 During the course of today's conversation,

01:24.520 --> 01:27.280
 Dr. Johnson and I talk about psychedelics

01:27.280 --> 01:29.800
 at the level of what's called microdosing,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.880
 whether or not it is useful for the treatment

01:31.880 --> 01:33.480
 of any mental disorders.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.960
 We also talk about more typical macrodosing,

01:35.960 --> 01:37.720
 what those macrodoses entail,

01:37.720 --> 01:41.000
 and he walks us through what an experiment

01:41.000 --> 01:42.600
 of a patient taking psychedelics

01:42.600 --> 01:44.460
 for the treatment of depression looks like

01:44.460 --> 01:47.040
 in his laboratory from start to finish.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.740
 The conversation was an absolutely fascinating one

01:49.740 --> 01:51.120
 for me to partake in.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.800
 I learned so much about the past, present, and future

01:54.800 --> 01:57.160
 of psychedelic treatments and compounds.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.800
 And indeed, I hope to have Dr. Johnson

01:58.800 --> 02:01.840
 on this podcast again in the not too distant future

02:01.840 --> 02:04.160
 so that we can talk about other compounds

02:04.160 --> 02:07.280
 that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.660
 and perhaps can also be used to treat various diseases.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.520
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

02:12.520 --> 02:13.780
 that this podcast is separate

02:13.780 --> 02:16.200
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.400
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:18.400 --> 02:21.160
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:21.160 --> 02:23.920
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.000
 In keeping with that theme,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.840
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.240
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.000
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

02:32.000 --> 02:34.400
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.040
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

02:37.040 --> 02:39.800
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.720
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,

02:41.720 --> 02:43.560
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

02:43.560 --> 02:45.480
 once or twice a day, every day,

02:45.480 --> 02:48.800
 is because it covers my foundational nutritional needs.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.760
 It has the vitamins I need, the minerals I need,

02:50.760 --> 02:52.920
 and the probiotics are important to me

02:52.920 --> 02:55.120
 because there is now so much data

02:55.120 --> 02:57.760
 about the importance of the so-called gut microbiome,

02:57.760 --> 03:00.000
 maintaining healthy gut bacteria,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.840
 and the ways in which those gut bacteria

03:01.840 --> 03:03.800
 impact things like inflammation

03:03.800 --> 03:06.460
 and keeping inflammation down in the brain and body,

03:06.460 --> 03:08.800
 as well as supporting things like quality mood,

03:08.800 --> 03:10.520
 endocrine function, metabolic function,

03:10.520 --> 03:11.960
 just so many factors.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.600
 The great thing about Athletic Greens

03:13.600 --> 03:14.960
 is that it also tastes very good.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.840
 I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon juice,

03:16.840 --> 03:20.360
 and as I mentioned, I drink that once or twice a day.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.760
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

03:21.760 --> 03:24.800
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.100
 and if you do that, you'll get the Athletic Greens,

03:27.100 --> 03:29.720
 plus you'll get five free travel packs.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.080
 The travel packs make it very easy

03:31.080 --> 03:33.160
 to mix up Athletic Greens when you're on the road,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.040
 in the car, on the plane, et cetera,

03:35.040 --> 03:38.640
 and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.080
 There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin D3 and K2

03:41.080 --> 03:44.000
 are important for various aspects of metabolic health,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.640
 cardiac health, and so forth.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.060
 So once again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:49.060 --> 03:51.740
 to get Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

03:51.740 --> 03:54.880
 and your year supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.380
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.840
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:00.840 --> 04:03.400
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:03.400 --> 04:05.280
 to help you better understand your body

04:05.280 --> 04:07.360
 and help you reach your health goals.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.360
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

04:10.360 --> 04:12.800
 and now with the advent of quality DNA tests,

04:12.800 --> 04:15.280
 you can get a lot of information about your genetics

04:15.280 --> 04:17.700
 and how that also impacts your immediate

04:17.700 --> 04:19.120
 and long-term health.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.320
 The reason I'm such a fan of getting blood work done

04:21.320 --> 04:23.800
 is that it is really the only way to understand

04:23.800 --> 04:25.960
 what's going on in your system at a level

04:25.960 --> 04:27.820
 that can really inform your decisions

04:27.820 --> 04:30.440
 about your immediate and long-term health.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.120
 The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however,

04:33.120 --> 04:35.400
 is that you get numbers back about your hormones

04:35.400 --> 04:36.940
 and your metabolic factors, et cetera,

04:36.940 --> 04:39.080
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.400
 With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy to use dashboard

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
 that gives you that information

04:43.800 --> 04:46.400
 and then gives you some suggestions and directives

04:46.400 --> 04:48.680
 about things you could change about your nutrition,

04:48.680 --> 04:50.880
 about your exercise and other lifestyle factors

04:50.880 --> 04:53.320
 that can help you move those numbers in the direction

04:53.320 --> 04:55.640
 that's best for you and for your health.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.100
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:57.100 --> 05:00.360
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:00.360 --> 05:03.160

 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.840
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Belcampo.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.500
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

05:11.500 --> 05:13.400
 that raises organic, grass-fed

05:13.400 --> 05:16.120
 and finished certified humane meats.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.760
 I eat meat about once a day.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.280
 In general, my lunch or my breakfast

05:20.280 --> 05:21.880
 consists of some meat

05:21.880 --> 05:23.640
 and that meat has to be a very high quality.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.640
 And generally I'll eat some vegetable as well.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.660
 And then I tend to eat pastas and rice

05:27.660 --> 05:30.240
 and things of that sort later in the day or in the evening

05:30.240 --> 05:32.720
 in order to facilitate the transition to sleep.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.800
 So I'm eating meat about once a day.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.320
 And I always insist that the meat that I eat

05:37.320 --> 05:38.840
 be of the very highest quality

05:38.840 --> 05:42.260
 and that the animals were raised and maintained humanely.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.680
 While conventionally raised animals

05:43.680 --> 05:44.840
 are confined to feed lots

05:44.840 --> 05:46.960
 and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,

05:46.960 --> 05:49.280
 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

05:49.280 --> 05:50.640
 and seasonal grasses,

05:50.640 --> 05:52.440
 resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients

05:52.440 --> 05:54.000
 and healthy fats.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.480
 In addition, they raise their animals

05:55.480 --> 05:57.560
 in a way that's not just better for our health,

05:57.560 --> 06:00.340
 but also has a positive impact on the environment.

06:00.340 --> 06:02.000
 They practice regenerative agriculture,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.100
 which means the meat is climate positive

06:04.100 --> 06:05.320
 and carbon negative.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.880
 So you can feel good about what you're eating

06:06.880 --> 06:09.960
 at the environmental level and for sake of your health.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.120
 You can order Belcampo's sustainably raised meats

06:12.120 --> 06:14.600
 to be delivered to you by using my code Huberman

06:14.600 --> 06:17.100

06:21.760 --> 06:24.640
 I'm partial to the ribeyes or the New York steaks.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.040
 So on one day I might have a ribeye,

06:26.040 --> 06:27.560
 the next day I might have a New York steak.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.240
 I also really like the meatballs.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.160
 I'm a particular fan of the meatballs.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.520
 So again, that's belcampo.com slash Huberman

06:34.520 --> 06:36.760
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout

06:36.760 --> 06:39.120
 to get 20% off your order.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.580
 And now my conversation with Dr. Matthew Johnson.

06:42.580 --> 06:43.800
 Well, Matthew, I've been looking forward

06:43.800 --> 06:44.960
 to this for a long time.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.440
 I'm a huge fan of your scientific work

06:48.440 --> 06:50.600
 and I'm eager to learn from you.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
 Likewise, big fan and happy to do this with you.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.340
 Great, well, thank you.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.280
 My first question is a very basic one,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.080
 which is what is a psychedelic?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.440
 We hear this term all the time,

07:01.440 --> 07:05.880
 but what qualifies a substance as a psychedelic?

07:05.880 --> 07:09.240
 Nomenclature is a real challenge

07:09.240 --> 07:10.760
 in this area of psychedelics.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.780
 So starting with the word psychedelic,

07:12.780 --> 07:16.000
 it just, if you're a pharmacologist,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.040
 it's not very satisfying

07:18.040 --> 07:21.160
 because that term really spans

07:21.160 --> 07:23.440
 different pharmacological classes.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.920
 In other words, if you're really concerned

07:24.920 --> 07:29.080
 about receptor effects and the basic effects of a compound,

07:29.080 --> 07:32.680
 it spans several classes of compounds.

07:32.680 --> 07:37.080
 But overall, so it's really more of a cultural term

07:37.080 --> 07:42.080
 or it does have a relationship to drug effects,

07:42.080 --> 07:44.880
 but it's at a very high level.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.020
 So all of the so-called psychedelics

07:47.020 --> 07:52.020
 across these distinct classes that I can talk more about,

07:54.160 --> 07:56.480
 the way I put it is they all have the ability

07:56.480 --> 08:00.520
 to profoundly alter one's sense of reality.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.080
 And that can mean many things.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.680
 Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self

08:05.560 --> 08:09.560
 acutely, so when someone's on the psychedelic.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.160
 So the different classes that can be,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.640
 the specific pharmacological classes

08:15.640 --> 08:17.640
 that can be called a psychedelic

08:17.640 --> 08:21.200
 are one, what are called the classic psychedelics.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.080
 So in the literature, you'll see that term.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.960
 And hallucinogen and psychedelic

08:25.960 --> 08:29.640
 are all have traditionally been used synonymously.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.320
 I think there was a little of a tendency

08:31.320 --> 08:33.380
 to stay away from psychedelics as the baggage,

08:33.380 --> 08:36.820
 but there's been a return to that in the last several years.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.440
 But the classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens

08:39.440 --> 08:44.160
 are things like LSD, psilocybin,

08:44.160 --> 08:47.160
 which is in so-called magic mushrooms.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.120
 It's in over 200 species that we know of so far

08:50.120 --> 08:53.800
 of mushrooms, dimethyltryptamine or DMT,

08:53.800 --> 08:58.080
 which is in dozens and dozens of plants,

08:58.080 --> 09:01.000
 mescaline, which is in the peyote cacti

09:01.000 --> 09:03.720
 and some other cacti like San Pedro.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.460
 And even amongst these classic psychedelics,

09:06.460 --> 09:10.860
 there are two structural classes.

09:10.860 --> 09:11.820
 So that's the chemistry.

09:11.820 --> 09:13.960
 There's the tryptamine-based compounds

09:13.960 --> 09:16.180
 like psilocybin and DMT.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.260
 And then there's the phenethylamine-based compounds.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.020
 So these are the two basic building blocks

09:23.020 --> 09:24.300
 that you're starting from,

09:24.300 --> 09:27.980
 either a tryptamine structure or a phenethylamine structure.

09:27.980 --> 09:29.660
 But that's just the chemistry.

09:29.660 --> 09:32.260
 All of the, what's more important,

09:32.260 --> 09:34.620
 or at least to someone like me,

09:34.620 --> 09:35.980
 are the receptor effects.

09:35.980 --> 09:38.060
 And then ultimately that's going to have a relationship

09:38.060 --> 09:39.980
 to the behavioral and subjective effects.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.460
 So all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonists

09:43.460 --> 09:47.100
 or partial agonists at the serotonin 2A receptor,

09:47.100 --> 09:49.860
 so subtype of serotonin receptor.

09:49.860 --> 09:54.500
 Then you have these other classes of compounds

09:54.500 --> 09:56.660
 that you could call psychedelic.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.240
 Another big one would be the NMDA antagonist.

09:59.240 --> 10:03.460
 So this would include ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan,

10:03.460 --> 10:04.900
 something I've done some research with,

10:04.900 --> 10:07.740
 which folks might recognize from like robo-tripping,

10:07.740 --> 10:11.740
 guzzling, like, you know, call syrup,

10:11.740 --> 10:13.840
 which is something kind of like high school kids

10:13.840 --> 10:16.060
 are known to do and they can't get ahold of real drugs,

10:16.060 --> 10:17.380
 that type of thing.

10:17.380 --> 10:22.380
 So a large overlap in the types of subjective effects

10:23.020 --> 10:24.580
 that you get from those compounds

10:24.580 --> 10:29.100
 compared to the 2A agonist classic psychedelics.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.500
 But then you have, and by the way,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.900
 this description, this framework I'm describing,

10:33.900 --> 10:35.340
 not everyone will agree.

10:35.340 --> 10:36.380
 Some people will say,

10:36.380 --> 10:40.040
 no, psychedelic only means classic psychedelic.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.540
 So there's different opinions here.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.860
 But you have, gosh, salvinorin A,

10:43.860 --> 10:48.340
 which is a kappa opioid agonist, which again-

10:48.340 --> 10:49.620
 Where does that come from?

10:49.620 --> 10:51.020
 Salvia divinorum.

10:51.020 --> 10:53.180
 It's a plant that became 20 years ago.

10:53.180 --> 10:56.100
 It sort of popped onto the legal high scene.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.540
 And there's a long history of this.

10:58.540 --> 11:00.880
 Predating the internet, going back to like the stuff

11:00.880 --> 11:03.900
 that went good or in the back of High Times Magazine.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.260
 And most of this stuff like never worked, you know?

11:06.260 --> 11:07.980
 It's like, smoke enough of anything,

11:07.980 --> 11:09.740
 maybe you get a little bit lightheaded.

11:09.740 --> 11:12.300
 But this is one of those things that popped around

11:12.300 --> 11:15.020
 20 years ago when it quickly got the reputation of like,

11:15.020 --> 11:17.260
 holy shit, this stuff actually works

11:17.260 --> 11:19.420
 and works really strongly.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.520
 And these smoked extracts particularly,

11:21.520 --> 11:25.620
 people have these reality altering experiences

11:25.620 --> 11:29.500
 on par with smoked DMT, the classic psychedelic.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.300
 So often, and we did the first blinded,

11:32.300 --> 11:34.300
 controlled human research with salvinorin A.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.020
 So lots of entity contact.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.800
 So feeling that you, in the experience of one,

11:39.800 --> 11:43.460
 is actually interacting with autonomous beings,

11:43.460 --> 11:44.980
 that type of thing.

11:44.980 --> 11:46.820
 And then you have another big one,

11:46.820 --> 11:48.620
 I probably should have mentioned even before the,

11:48.620 --> 11:51.820
 you know, salvinorin A, but you have MDMA,

11:51.820 --> 11:53.900
 which really stands in a class by itself.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.260
 So it's been called an entactogen and-

11:57.260 --> 11:58.800
 What does that mean?

11:58.800 --> 12:01.820
 It means like, touching within.

12:01.820 --> 12:04.860
 It sort of eludes the idea that it can really put someone

12:04.860 --> 12:07.460
 in touch with their emotions.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.500
 It's also been called an empathogen,

12:09.500 --> 12:11.440
 meaning can it can afford empathy.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.240
 But I think entactogen is probably,

12:14.240 --> 12:17.220
 that's the term that I tend to focus on.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.780
 And I know I'm not telling you anything you don't know,

12:19.780 --> 12:24.780
 but for the viewers, the primary mechanism of MDMA

12:25.620 --> 12:27.920
 is serotonin release.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.060
 And to a degree, other monoamine release,

12:31.060 --> 12:32.780
 dopamine, serotonin.

12:32.780 --> 12:37.620
 And so structurally, that's also in the phenethylamine class

12:37.620 --> 12:42.140
 which contains mescaline, the classic psychedelic,

12:42.140 --> 12:43.660
 but also amphetamine.

12:43.660 --> 12:48.660
 So just like Adderall is in that phenethylamine class.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.540
 And so this is another example

12:50.540 --> 12:52.060
 where chemistry doesn't dictate.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.940
 I mean, you can tweak a molecule,

12:53.940 --> 12:56.620
 it might have that same basic structure,

12:56.620 --> 12:58.300
 but now you've profoundly changed the way

12:58.300 --> 12:59.540
 it interacts with the receptor.

12:59.540 --> 13:04.540
 So MDMA does not exert its actions

13:05.540 --> 13:10.540
 by, I like to say, by mimicking the baseball,

13:11.060 --> 13:16.060
 entering the postsynaptic receptor side,

13:16.380 --> 13:17.480
 acting as an agonist.

13:17.480 --> 13:22.480
 So mimicking the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin,

13:23.100 --> 13:25.180
 like the classic psychedelics do,

13:25.180 --> 13:27.380
 MDMA works on the pitcher side

13:27.380 --> 13:30.900
 of just basically throwing out more of the natural,

13:30.900 --> 13:31.740
 the endogenous.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.580
 Dumping more serotonin.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.940
 Dumping more serotonin, flooding the synapse.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.500
 So I get the impression that the psychedelic space

13:39.500 --> 13:43.460
 is a enormous cloud of partially overlapping compounds.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.300
 Right.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.660
 Meaning some are impacting the serotonin system

13:46.660 --> 13:47.900
 more than the dopamine system.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.180
 Others are impacting the dopamine system

13:50.180 --> 13:52.840
 more than the serotonin system.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.100
 Given that the definition of a psychedelic

13:55.100 --> 13:59.180
 is that it profoundly alters sense of self,

13:59.180 --> 14:03.180
 at least that's included as a partial definition.

14:03.180 --> 14:06.500
 Can we break that down into a couple of subcategories?

14:06.500 --> 14:10.860
 So for instance, hallucinating, either auditory or visual.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.840
 Synesthesia, perceptual blending,

14:14.840 --> 14:19.840
 the sense that you can hear colors and see sounds,

14:19.980 --> 14:22.660
 for instance, a common report of people

14:22.660 --> 14:26.480
 that take psychedelics in sufficiently high doses.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.880
 So hallucinating, synesthesia,

14:28.880 --> 14:32.080
 and then in terms of sense of self,

14:32.080 --> 14:34.020
 you know, as a neuroscientist, I think,

14:34.020 --> 14:36.800
 okay, what does it mean to alter a sense of reality?

14:36.800 --> 14:40.940
 Really what the brain does in a very coarse way

14:41.900 --> 14:45.060
 is to try and figure out what's happening in space,

14:45.060 --> 14:47.740
 physical space, and that physical space could be within us

14:47.740 --> 14:50.060
 or outside us, and what's happening in time.

14:50.060 --> 14:50.900
 Right.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.100
 And as a vision scientist, the simplest explanation

14:54.100 --> 14:57.180
 is when I move my hand from one location to another location,

14:57.180 --> 14:58.820
 it's measuring the space,

14:58.820 --> 15:01.260
 the location of my hand in space over time.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.220
 And then you get a rate and a speed

15:03.220 --> 15:04.420
 and all that kind of stuff, right?

15:04.420 --> 15:05.880
 Yeah.

15:05.880 --> 15:06.820
 That gets more complicated

15:06.820 --> 15:09.860
 as you get into the emotional realm.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.060
 But is it fair to say that psychedelics

15:12.060 --> 15:15.780
 are impacting the space time analysis

15:15.780 --> 15:16.980
 that the brain is performing

15:16.980 --> 15:19.620
 and thereby creating hallucinations

15:19.620 --> 15:24.620
 and thereby altering, you know, the blending of senses?

15:25.940 --> 15:27.300
 Is it fair to say that?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.140
 I think it's fair to explore that area.

15:31.140 --> 15:32.620
 And here's what I'm thinking.

15:32.620 --> 15:36.600
 The clearly there is a changed relationship,

15:36.600 --> 15:40.760
 certainly at the right dose of orientation and space time.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.100
 I think as a, you know, I'm primarily a behaviorist

15:46.100 --> 15:49.400
 and in terms of human behavioral pharmacology,

15:49.400 --> 15:51.620
 I always go to comparative pharmacology.

15:51.620 --> 15:54.220
 Okay, what can we say that is it truly unique

15:54.220 --> 15:57.420
 about the classic psychedelic or psychedelics in general?

15:57.420 --> 16:00.260
 So with that description, I'm thinking, okay,

16:00.260 --> 16:03.140
 alcohol can really screw up your, you know,

16:03.140 --> 16:05.300
 time-space orientation.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.140
 And proprioception, your balance.

16:06.140 --> 16:06.980
 Proprioception.

16:06.980 --> 16:07.820
 Your vestibular, yeah.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.100
 You know, and in many ways,

16:10.100 --> 16:12.980
 and sort of in those gross motorways, like far worse,

16:12.980 --> 16:14.600
 you know, of course everything's dose dependent,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.220
 but in the classic psychedelics, you know,

16:16.220 --> 16:18.660
 obviously the benzodiazepines being very similar alcohol,

16:18.660 --> 16:19.500
 same thing.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.860
 So, you know, I'd want to, you know,

16:22.860 --> 16:25.140
 dig in a little more in terms of like,

16:25.140 --> 16:27.380
 maybe there's something more specific we could say

16:27.380 --> 16:31.620
 about that relationship to time and space

16:31.620 --> 16:33.740
 that the psychedelics are tinkering with,

16:33.740 --> 16:34.660
 but I'm not sure.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.760
 It's an interesting hypothesis that the idea

16:36.760 --> 16:39.020
 that that's a mediator, that that's something,

16:39.020 --> 16:42.360
 that there's something fundamental about changing that,

16:42.360 --> 16:45.980
 the representation in time and space.

16:45.980 --> 16:49.200
 There might be something to that.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.740
 I mean, I think of these as psychedelics

16:51.740 --> 16:55.720
 as profoundly altering models, you know,

16:55.720 --> 16:58.780
 we're all, you know, we're prediction machines

16:58.780 --> 17:02.640
 and that's large, so much of that is top-down

17:02.640 --> 17:07.640
 and psychedelics have a good way of, you know,

17:08.240 --> 17:11.520
 loosely speaking, dissolving those models.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.360
 And one of the reality-

17:13.360 --> 17:15.520
 Can you give us an example of one of like a model,

17:15.520 --> 17:18.800
 like I know that when I throw a ball in the air,

17:18.800 --> 17:20.220
 it falls down, not up.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.960
 That's a prediction that I learned as a child

17:23.960 --> 17:27.400
 that I did not come into the world with a brain

17:27.400 --> 17:32.400
 that knew that relationship between objects and gravity.

17:32.680 --> 17:36.260
 But one of the first things that a child learns

17:36.260 --> 17:39.360
 is the relationship between objects and gravity

17:39.360 --> 17:40.320
 and their trajectories.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.200
 Yeah, and with a four-year-old, I mean,

17:42.200 --> 17:44.200
 I saw that at earlier ages,

17:44.200 --> 17:46.160
 like that experimentation of like,

17:46.160 --> 17:48.400
 oh yeah, that's what happens, you know?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.600
 Right, so if he were to throw a ball,

17:50.600 --> 17:52.160
 if your child were to throw a ball

17:52.160 --> 17:54.020
 and it went up into the sky,

17:54.020 --> 17:57.220
 that would be absolutely mind-blowing.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.480
 It would be for an adult too.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.100
 It'd be a pretty psychedelic experience probably.

18:01.100 --> 18:04.400
 Right, and so there's a rule there, you're saying,

18:04.400 --> 18:07.360
 there's a kind of a prediction,

18:07.360 --> 18:09.920
 there's a rule that underlies a prediction

18:09.920 --> 18:13.200
 that when that rule is violated,

18:13.200 --> 18:14.840
 all of a sudden the circuit, presumably,

18:14.840 --> 18:18.040
 for that prediction, it doesn't have a mind of its own,

18:18.040 --> 18:20.440
 but somehow it creates a surprise element

18:20.440 --> 18:22.800
 or a recognition element.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.000
 And it's not filtered out, you know?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.020
 And this might sound extreme, but there are these cases,

18:30.020 --> 18:32.680
 it was overblown in sort of the propaganda

18:32.680 --> 18:34.460
 of the late 60s, early 70s,

18:34.460 --> 18:37.440
 but there are credible cases of people,

18:37.440 --> 18:39.120
 I think it's very atypical,

18:39.120 --> 18:42.480
 of sounds like they really thought they could fly.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.120
 And jump out of a window.

18:46.120 --> 18:51.120
 Now, far more people every year fall,

18:51.120 --> 18:55.360
 I mean, who knows, they fall and die from height

18:55.360 --> 18:59.040
 because they're drunk, so this is extremely rare.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.260
 But there are some pretty convincing cases.

19:03.260 --> 19:06.040
 There was one research volunteer in our studies

19:06.040 --> 19:11.040
 that she looked like she was, in one of our studies,

19:11.040 --> 19:14.060
 like she was trying to dive through a painting on the wall.

19:14.060 --> 19:18.100
 She was fine, but she, reviewing the video,

19:18.100 --> 19:21.400
 it looked like she really thought

19:21.400 --> 19:23.960
 that she was going to go through that painting

19:23.960 --> 19:28.240
 and who knows, enter the other dimension.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.480
 Yeah, so they're violating these predictions.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.860
 Yeah, the reason I ask it, the question the way I did,

19:34.860 --> 19:38.480
 is because given the enormous cloud of different substances

19:38.480 --> 19:41.520
 and given the range of previous experiences

19:41.520 --> 19:44.380
 that people show up to a psychedelic experience with,

19:46.040 --> 19:47.800
 I feel like the ability to extract

19:47.800 --> 19:50.200
 some universal themes is useful,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.640
 especially for people who haven't done them before, right?

19:52.640 --> 19:54.560
 Who might not have an understanding

19:54.560 --> 19:56.520
 of what their effects are like.

19:56.520 --> 20:01.520
 Can we just briefly touch on the serotonin system

20:01.800 --> 20:03.000
 and the dopamine system?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.880
 I want to acknowledge it, as you already know,

20:05.880 --> 20:08.440
 that there are many neuromodulator systems in the body.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.860
 And, you know, the opioid systems, cannabinoid systems,

20:10.860 --> 20:13.320
 but there's something so profound

20:13.320 --> 20:15.740
 about the serotonin system and the dopamine system,

20:15.740 --> 20:19.400
 because the way I define a neuromodulator is,

20:19.400 --> 20:20.920
 it's a modulator, it changes the way

20:20.920 --> 20:22.680
 that other circuits behave.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.480
 And essentially it increases the probability

20:25.480 --> 20:26.840
 that certain circuits will be active

20:26.840 --> 20:27.900
 and decreases the probability

20:27.900 --> 20:31.480
 that other circuits will be active, in a general sense.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.560
 So, compounds like LSD,

20:34.560 --> 20:38.400
 lysergic acid, diethylamide, and psilocybin,

20:38.400 --> 20:40.760
 my understanding is that they primarily

20:41.920 --> 20:44.000
 target the serotonin system.

20:44.980 --> 20:48.440
 How do they do that at a kind of general level?

20:48.440 --> 20:51.240
 And why would increasing the activity

20:51.240 --> 20:53.100
 of a particular serotonin receptor

20:53.100 --> 20:55.120
 or batch of serotonin receptors

20:55.120 --> 20:58.360
 lead to these profoundly different experiences

20:58.360 --> 21:02.600
 that we're calling model challenges,

21:02.600 --> 21:05.040
 challenging pre-existing models and predictions?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.560
 I mean, at the end of the day, it's a chemical

21:07.560 --> 21:09.800
 and these receptors are scattered around the brain

21:09.800 --> 21:12.120
 with billions of other receptors.

21:14.060 --> 21:17.160
 What do we think is going on in a general sense?

21:17.160 --> 21:18.000
 Yeah, yeah.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.200
 And this is really the area of active exploration

21:21.200 --> 21:22.680
 and we don't have great answers.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.320
 We know a good amount

21:24.320 --> 21:26.380
 about the receptor level pharmacology,

21:26.380 --> 21:29.840
 some things about post receptor signaling pathways.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.520
 In other words, just fitting into the receptor,

21:32.520 --> 21:36.280
 clearly serotonin itself is not psychedelic,

21:36.280 --> 21:38.320
 or else we'd be tripping all of us all the time.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.280
 Because when I eat a bagel,

21:39.280 --> 21:41.360
 I get serotonin release, right?

21:41.360 --> 21:45.160
 I mean, there's turkey, I mean, there's triptophan, right?

21:45.160 --> 21:49.040
 My understanding of serotonin is that in very broad strokes,

21:49.040 --> 21:53.000
 that it generally leads to a state of being fairly,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.440
 it pushes the mind and body towards a state of contentment

21:56.440 --> 21:59.560
 within the immediate experience.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.000
 Whereas the dopamine system really places us

22:02.000 --> 22:05.280
 into an external view of what's out there in the world

22:05.280 --> 22:06.280
 and what's possible.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.240
 Yeah, we need to do something.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.540
 I mean, that's consistent with my understanding.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.480
 And I'll certainly not, in terms of,

22:14.480 --> 22:17.800
 I don't primarily identify as a neuroscientist,

22:17.800 --> 22:19.560
 definitely tell the viewers

22:19.560 --> 22:23.140
 that we're far more in your domain here than mine,

22:23.140 --> 22:25.960
 but in terms of how psychedelics and other drugs

22:25.960 --> 22:28.320
 interface at the neuroscience level.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.360
 Well, feel free to explain it at the experiential level.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.200
 I mean, it doesn't have,

22:32.200 --> 22:35.000
 I think there probably are some audience members

22:35.000 --> 22:36.840
 that are interested in, is it the 5-H2C?

22:36.840 --> 22:39.120
 Is it the layer five neurons and cortex?

22:39.120 --> 22:40.520
 That conversation we could hold,

22:40.520 --> 22:41.800
 and that's an interesting conversation.

22:41.800 --> 22:46.000
 But just in terms of the experience of serotonergic

22:46.000 --> 22:48.640
 versus dopaminergic drugs,

22:48.640 --> 22:53.640
 they do seem to create distinct classes of experience.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.020
 So I think that's the appropriate level

22:57.020 --> 22:58.160
 for us to discuss them.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.200
 And in terms of how they, and I'd like to explore the biology

23:01.200 --> 23:03.400
 a little bit here and tell you sort of what's known

23:03.400 --> 23:05.320
 and what some of the ideas are.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.460
 You have this path, as you know,

23:09.460 --> 23:11.040
 these are levels of analysis,

23:11.040 --> 23:13.120
 and it's not which one is going on.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.240
 It's almost like, for the particular question,

23:15.240 --> 23:17.760
 which level of analysis is most appropriate?

23:17.760 --> 23:21.120
 Is a question best addressed by the biology,

23:21.120 --> 23:23.400
 the chemistry, or the physics?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.160
 That's how I think of receptor level,

23:25.160 --> 23:27.600
 post-receptor signaling, downstream effects

23:27.600 --> 23:29.440
 on other neurotransmitters,

23:29.440 --> 23:32.880
 and then activation level effects,

23:32.880 --> 23:35.760
 and then coordination of activation.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.380
 So you've got the, clearly with the classic psychedelics,

23:39.380 --> 23:43.400
 the 2A activation, we do know

23:43.400 --> 23:44.800
 that there are downstream effects

23:44.800 --> 23:47.960
 in terms of increasing glutamate transmission.

23:47.960 --> 23:52.240
 So this is likely a commonality why ketamine

23:52.240 --> 23:54.320
 is very psychedelic in a slightly different way.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.140
 But-

23:55.140 --> 23:55.980
 Do people hallucinate on ketamine?

23:55.980 --> 23:58.160
 Yes, yes, and it's more dissociative,

23:58.160 --> 24:00.320
 so someone is more likely to sort of

24:01.200 --> 24:03.160
 be less behaviorally active.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.240
 If they have a really high dose, they go into a K hole,

24:05.240 --> 24:06.700
 and if they go in a really high dose,

24:06.700 --> 24:09.080
 like you get into surgery, you're just unconscious.

24:09.080 --> 24:09.920
 Yeah, a K hole.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.760
 Not an A hole, but a K hole.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.180
 A K hole, yeah, it's very different.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.320
 The K hole, and ketamine's interesting

24:16.320 --> 24:17.800
 because people can take kind of bumps

24:17.800 --> 24:19.000
 and kind of dance on it

24:19.000 --> 24:22.200
 with the sort of an alcohol level strength of effect,

24:22.200 --> 24:25.900
 and that's sort of the classic kind of raving use of it.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.780
 But then those folks want to titrate their dose

24:28.780 --> 24:31.120
 because if they do more of like a line,

24:31.120 --> 24:33.620
 you get up to like 75, 100 milligrams,

24:33.620 --> 24:37.160
 then you're talking about, you know,

24:37.160 --> 24:39.680
 if you're on the dance floor, you're on the floor,

24:39.680 --> 24:41.360
 and your friends are trying to make sure

24:41.360 --> 24:42.560
 people aren't stepping on you.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.400
 So that's like-

24:43.400 --> 24:45.300
 Yeah, why would somebody want to take

24:45.300 --> 24:47.400
 a dissociative anesthetic?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.920
 Like to me, it's completely mysterious

24:49.920 --> 24:53.540
 as to why someone would want to dissociate from their body.

24:53.540 --> 24:58.540
 People claim that these NMDA antagonist psychedelics

24:58.780 --> 25:00.540
 are extremely insightful, you know,

25:00.540 --> 25:03.300
 in a very similar way to the experiences

25:03.300 --> 25:05.240
 with the classic psychedelics.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.320
 And ketamine is now legal for therapeutic use, right?

25:07.320 --> 25:08.160
 Right, right.

25:08.160 --> 25:13.160
 Spravato, the intranasal form marketed by Janssen,

25:13.600 --> 25:15.960
 which is S-ketamine, and it's one of the-

25:15.960 --> 25:18.480
 Yeah, it's prescription, and-

25:18.480 --> 25:20.760
 So people are taking in the nasal spray.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.600
 Yeah.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.200
 And then are they undergoing talk therapy

25:23.200 --> 25:24.080
 while they're doing this?

25:24.080 --> 25:25.040
 Typically not.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.800
 So this is very interesting,

25:26.800 --> 25:29.560
 and there's so much work that needs to be done.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.300
 It's not treated as psychedelic therapy.

25:32.300 --> 25:35.180
 And by that, psychedelic therapy, I mean,

25:35.180 --> 25:36.440
 you tell the person they're going to have

25:36.440 --> 25:38.160
 an altered experience.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.480
 You tell them to pay attention to that experience,

25:41.480 --> 25:43.320
 that they might learn something from that experience.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.760
 And afterwards, you discuss that experience.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.960
 With Spravato, the model is-

25:48.960 --> 25:49.860
 Spravato is?

25:49.860 --> 25:50.960
 Is S-ketamine.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.800
 Okay.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.440
 That's the, yeah, the spray form of ketamine.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.920
 It's been FDA approved for treatment-resistant depression,

25:57.920 --> 26:00.520
 but you'll probably feel different.

26:00.520 --> 26:01.560
 Ignore that.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.040
 That's a side effect.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.420
 That's an adverse effect.

26:05.260 --> 26:06.920
 Just ignore it.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.880
 We don't think that has anything to do with the way it works,

26:09.880 --> 26:10.960
 but just get this thing.

26:10.960 --> 26:15.080
 It's a direct sort of chemotherapeutic effect in a sense.

26:15.080 --> 26:19.320
 It's not facilitating a learning process.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.040
 Now, there's older work.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.100
 There was a guy, Krupitsky, in Russia

26:23.100 --> 26:27.040
 that did extensive work with higher doses of ketamine.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.040
 I should say Spravato at the prescribed doses

26:30.040 --> 26:32.600
 isn't very, it's a pretty low dose.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.660
 It's in the mild psychedelic range, but it's not very strong.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.220
 But this older work that happened in the 90s

26:39.220 --> 26:42.060
 and early 2000s in Russia,

26:42.060 --> 26:43.360
 they were using very high doses

26:43.360 --> 26:45.340
 and treating it like a psychedelic,

26:45.340 --> 26:48.220
 treating it as if it was a psychedelic therapy.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.600
 In other words, telling people,

26:49.600 --> 26:50.800
 you're going to have this experience.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.320
 It's going to, you know,

26:52.320 --> 26:54.080
 we're hoping you learn something from it.

26:54.080 --> 26:54.960
 We're going to help you through it.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.360
 We're going to discuss it afterwards.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.840
 And they found incredibly high rates of success

26:58.840 --> 27:00.420
 in some pretty well-controlled trials

27:00.420 --> 27:04.860
 for both heroin addiction and alcohol addiction.

27:04.860 --> 27:07.620
 So I think a whole lot of work needs to be done now.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.320
 And you see some of the ketamine clinics

27:09.320 --> 27:10.900
 that are using ketamine off-label,

27:10.900 --> 27:13.960
 a lot of them are treating it like psychedelic therapy.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.700
 There's essentially no research at this point on that.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.060
 Do you get better results?

27:19.060 --> 27:22.100
 Straight abusive Spervado,

27:22.100 --> 27:23.440
 there's some good variability,

27:23.440 --> 27:26.940
 but its antidepressant effects last about a week.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.500
 But they kick in immediately.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.900
 Now, a week is a long time for like most psychiatric drugs.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.900
 Like you take it every day.

27:34.900 --> 27:37.000
 So that's amazing, but it's still just a week.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.620
 We're seeing effects a year or more later

27:40.620 --> 27:44.460
 with psilocybin and some of the classic psychedelics.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.460
 That could be a pharmacological difference,

27:46.460 --> 27:49.140
 or it could be that they get a lot more mileage

27:49.140 --> 27:53.340
 out of ketamine if they treated it like psychedelic therapy.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.180
 And so that's some-

27:54.180 --> 27:56.020
 What would that look like?

27:56.020 --> 27:59.380
 Really just like our psilocybin sessions,

27:59.380 --> 28:00.900
 which I know I haven't described,

28:00.900 --> 28:03.940
 but briefly you have anywhere from four to eight hours

28:03.940 --> 28:05.940
 of preparation, getting to know the people

28:05.940 --> 28:06.980
 who are going to be the guides

28:06.980 --> 28:08.140
 or the therapists in the room.

28:08.140 --> 28:10.420
 Yeah, maybe you could walk us through this.

28:10.420 --> 28:14.460
 So let's say I were to come to one of your clinical trials,

28:14.460 --> 28:16.540
 because these are clinical trials, right?

28:16.540 --> 28:18.100
 At your lab at Hopkins.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.920
 And would I need to be depressed

28:19.920 --> 28:20.860
 or could I just be somebody

28:20.860 --> 28:22.740
 who wanted to explore psychedelics?

28:22.740 --> 28:25.620
 We've had studies for all of these

28:25.620 --> 28:27.260
 and a number of other disorders.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.900
 So healthy normal studies,

28:28.900 --> 28:31.380
 the code for not a problem to fix,

28:31.380 --> 28:32.220
 but we're all here.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.260
 That's what's amazing about psychedelics though,

28:34.260 --> 28:37.340
 because if you administer them under this model

28:37.340 --> 28:38.620
 and you develop a relationship

28:38.620 --> 28:40.140
 and give a high dose of psychedelic,

28:40.140 --> 28:42.700
 you can be a healthy normal without a diagnosable issue.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.640
 But man, we're all human

28:44.640 --> 28:47.100
 and the issues seem to come to the surface.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.180
 So, but we've done work with smoking cessation.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.780
 So people trying to quit tobacco

28:51.780 --> 28:52.620
 and haven't been successful.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.260
 So a variety of reasons.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.060
 So maybe I'll just ask some very simple questions

28:57.060 --> 28:58.580
 that would kind of step us through the process.

28:58.580 --> 29:01.100
 So let's say I were to sign up for one of these trials

29:01.100 --> 29:03.220
 and I qualified for one of these trials.

29:03.220 --> 29:06.040
 I'd show up, you said I would do several hours in advance

29:06.040 --> 29:07.140
 of getting to know the team

29:07.140 --> 29:11.100
 that would be present during this psychedelic journey.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.160
 First there's screening.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.580
 So it's kind of like a couple of days of both psychiatric,

29:15.580 --> 29:17.900
 like structured psychiatric interviews

29:17.900 --> 29:20.780
 about your whole, your past and symptoms

29:20.780 --> 29:23.740
 across the DSM, the psychiatric Bible

29:23.740 --> 29:25.980
 to see if you might have various disorders

29:25.980 --> 29:28.380
 that could disqualify you.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.860
 Like the main ones being the psychotic disorders,

29:30.860 --> 29:34.300
 schizophrenia, and also including bipolar.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.780
 So the manic side of bipolar.

29:36.780 --> 29:39.580
 So after that, and also cardiovascular screening,

29:39.580 --> 29:41.140
 heart disease, after that screening,

29:41.140 --> 29:42.700
 then the preparation where you get,

29:42.700 --> 29:46.140
 you're both, you develop a therapeutic rapport

29:46.140 --> 29:48.300
 with the people who are going to be in the room with you,

29:48.300 --> 29:52.620
 your guides, but you're also then didactically

29:52.620 --> 29:56.480
 sort of explained about what the psychedelic could be like.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.200
 And that's kind of a laundry list

29:58.200 --> 30:00.980
 because they're more known by their variability

30:00.980 --> 30:03.260
 than it's going to, it's not like cocaine.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.380
 Like you're going to feel stimulated.

30:05.380 --> 30:07.980
 You're going to feel like you can do any,

30:07.980 --> 30:09.500
 it's like, or alcohol.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.300
 You're probably going to feel more relaxed.

30:11.300 --> 30:15.060
 It's like, I call them uppers, downers, and all-arounders,

30:15.060 --> 30:16.780
 and the psychedelics are all-arounders.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.800
 It's like, yeah, you could be,

30:18.800 --> 30:22.660
 you could have the most beautiful experience of your life

30:22.660 --> 30:24.800
 or the most terrifying experience of your life.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.060
 So it's this kind of laundry list

30:26.060 --> 30:27.180
 of like the things that could happen.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.620
 So there's no surprises.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.260
 I think it's so important for people to hear

30:31.260 --> 30:34.900
 because the all-arounders, they,

30:34.900 --> 30:36.500
 you really can't predict how somebody

30:36.500 --> 30:38.540
 is going to react internally.

30:38.540 --> 30:39.940
 Right.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.620
 I want to just briefly touch on something

30:42.620 --> 30:44.420
 because we left that topic,

30:44.420 --> 30:48.560
 but it occurred to me that a lot of these effects

30:48.560 --> 30:50.860
 of psychedelics and how they function, et cetera,

30:50.860 --> 30:52.040
 is still very mysterious.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.300
 But then I recall to mind

30:54.300 --> 30:57.160
 that how most prescription antidepressants work

30:57.160 --> 30:58.880
 is also very mysterious.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.140
 They increase serotonin or dopamine or epinephrine, et cetera,

31:02.140 --> 31:04.120
 but why they take weeks on end,

31:04.120 --> 31:06.740
 several weeks to kick in, et cetera, is also mysterious.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.580
 But going back to the experience

31:09.580 --> 31:11.180
 of coming to your laboratory.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.700
 Okay, so let's say that somebody passes

31:13.700 --> 31:18.700
 all the prerequisites and it's the day.

31:19.300 --> 31:22.420
 Comes the day that they're going to have this experience.

31:22.420 --> 31:26.780
 Are they eating mushrooms like you hear about

31:26.780 --> 31:29.140
 or are they taking it in capsule form?

31:29.140 --> 31:32.460
 And what sorts of doses are you prescribing?

31:32.460 --> 31:34.100
 Is there a dose response curve?

31:34.100 --> 31:37.480
 Yeah. And then secondary to that,

31:37.480 --> 31:40.280
 I'd like to talk about microdose versus macrodose.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.100
 So how do they get this stuff into,

31:42.100 --> 31:44.720
 how do people receive it

31:44.720 --> 31:46.080
 and how do they get it into their body?

31:46.080 --> 31:48.200
 So they receive pure psilocybin.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.240
 So the mushroom, and there are many species,

31:51.240 --> 31:53.140
 the most private, people have taken mushrooms

31:53.140 --> 31:54.080
 in the United States.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.680
 It's most likely psilocybe cubensis.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.600
 They're easy to grow.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.880
 They grow in cow patties.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.760
 It's easy for any body to grow them in their closet.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.600
 It doesn't take a 1,000-watt light like cannabis.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.680
 It takes like a little 10-watt light bulb

32:08.680 --> 32:09.640
 and a Tupperware bin.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.320
 So those are the types of mushrooms

32:12.320 --> 32:13.280
 that people typically take.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.920
 We're not administering those.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.380
 Psilocybin is the compound.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.920
 You could draw a molecule, psilocybin,

32:19.920 --> 32:22.360
 again, based on the tryptamine structure.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.760
 That's a single molecular entity.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.080
 So it's a white powder.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.480
 Does it look like serotonin molecularly?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.440
 Yes, yes, yes.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.000
 So if I were to show people

32:32.000 --> 32:33.440
 the chemical structure of serotonin,

32:33.440 --> 32:35.160
 the chemical structure of psilocybin,

32:35.160 --> 32:36.560
 it would look quite similar.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.400
 Right, right.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.600
 So they're basically taking serotonin.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.840
 A modified version of serotonin, which makes sense.

32:43.840 --> 32:47.660
 But then again, this repeated theme of the chemistry

32:47.660 --> 32:49.380
 doesn't always neatly line up

32:49.380 --> 32:54.340
 because like mescaline looks more like dopamine

32:54.340 --> 32:55.780
 than it does like serotonin,

32:55.780 --> 32:58.980
 but yet at the receptor activation level,

32:58.980 --> 33:01.640
 the pharmacological effect,

33:01.640 --> 33:03.160
 those are similar.

33:03.160 --> 33:06.360
 But yeah, and what it does at the receptor

33:06.360 --> 33:09.000
 is it's hitting the same switch,

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
 but then having an alternate response at the receptor level.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.680
 So for people that don't necessarily understand

33:15.680 --> 33:17.640
 the relationship between what we call ligand,

33:17.640 --> 33:19.400
 the thing that parks in the receptor,

33:19.400 --> 33:21.240
 and the receptor is the parking spot,

33:21.240 --> 33:24.320
 one of the reasons that you can get such a variety

33:24.320 --> 33:26.840
 of effects from different compounds is,

33:26.840 --> 33:30.480
 for instance, serotonin might affect a certain pathway

33:30.480 --> 33:32.080
 at a particular rate,

33:32.080 --> 33:35.460
 and psilocybin might trigger activation

33:35.460 --> 33:37.560
 of different components of that pathway at different rates,

33:37.560 --> 33:40.320
 and so you can get vastly different experiences

33:40.320 --> 33:42.640
 from two things that look chemically similar.

33:42.640 --> 33:47.640
 This is also a good reason why people shouldn't just assume

33:47.800 --> 33:50.820
 that they can cowboy their own chemistry, right?

33:50.820 --> 33:53.440
 That what you see on paper and what you can mix up

33:53.440 --> 33:58.240
 in a vial is often vastly different than what you predict.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.120
 Right.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.680
 And there's a dose effect curve that's really interesting.

34:01.680 --> 34:06.380
 Some of our early work with psilocybin in healthy normals

34:06.380 --> 34:10.000
 looked at a true placebo plus four active doses,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.320
 five, 10, 20, and 30 milligrams of psilocybin.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.740
 Body weight adjusted,

34:14.740 --> 34:18.840
 so those milligrams per 70 kilograms of body weight.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.540
 We've recently published a paper in our newer trials

34:21.540 --> 34:23.680
 where we're dropping the body weight adjustment

34:23.680 --> 34:26.080
 because we're going across hundreds of volunteers.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.440
 We've kind of figured out that you shouldn't really be,

34:29.440 --> 34:32.080
 you don't need to be adjusting by body weight.

34:32.080 --> 34:32.920
 Interesting.

34:32.920 --> 34:33.760
 So, yeah.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.240
 Well, brain size doesn't vary that much between individuals.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.320
 Yeah, yeah.

34:38.320 --> 34:43.000
 And, you know, at the end, this is a brain effect, mostly.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.880
 Probably body as well.

34:44.880 --> 34:48.160
 Okay, so the person ingests the powder or capsule?

34:48.160 --> 34:49.120
 In a little pill.

34:49.120 --> 34:49.960
 Okay.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.220
 Yeah, and it doesn't take 30 milligrams as a small.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.940
 You could fit it into a tiny little capsule,

34:54.940 --> 34:57.160
 and it'll take about a half hour,

34:57.160 --> 35:00.400
 but anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to kick in.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.400
 And you said the dose range was?

35:03.900 --> 35:06.580
 Most of our studies are looking at

35:06.580 --> 35:08.760
 where we want a psychedelic effect

35:08.760 --> 35:12.740
 are in the 20 to 30 milligram range.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.200
 Again, because we have adjusted by body weight

35:15.200 --> 35:18.200
 and the average American is over 70 kilograms,

35:18.200 --> 35:19.400
 about 150 pounds.

35:19.400 --> 35:23.880
 Like people, and in fact, have gotten more like 40, 45

35:23.880 --> 35:25.280
 in a lot of cases.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.680
 But it's still a small pill.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.640
 The session day itself is not full of,

35:32.640 --> 35:34.840
 for most of our studies, is not full of tasks.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.560
 We really want to look at the therapeutic response.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.440
 Obviously, if it's a therapeutic study,

35:39.440 --> 35:41.640
 we want it to be a meaningful experience.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.440
 And research has found, not surprisingly,

35:44.440 --> 35:46.480
 that you get a less meaningful experience

35:46.480 --> 35:48.880
 when you're in an FMRI

35:48.880 --> 35:51.180
 or when you're doing a lot of cognitive tasks.

35:51.180 --> 35:56.180
 We've done some research of that type, for sure,

35:57.280 --> 35:59.080
 and plenty of colleagues have.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.760
 But when you're in a therapeutic study,

36:00.760 --> 36:02.840
 or if you're trying to understand the therapeutic effects,

36:02.840 --> 36:05.960
 you have to recognize there's this trade-off

36:05.960 --> 36:06.800
 of what you can do.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.560
 So our typical therapeutic model,

36:08.560 --> 36:10.900
 which again, isn't just limited necessarily

36:10.900 --> 36:12.120
 to the therapeutic studies

36:12.120 --> 36:14.440
 where we're trying to treat a specific disorder,

36:14.440 --> 36:17.940
 is to have that preparation

36:17.940 --> 36:21.280
 so the person feels very comfortable with their guides.

36:21.280 --> 36:25.680
 I mean, ultimately, what I tell people is like,

36:25.680 --> 36:28.200
 any emotional response, it's all welcome.

36:28.200 --> 36:33.040
 I mean, you could be crying like a baby hysterically.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.560
 Like, that's what you should be doing

36:34.560 --> 36:35.720
 if that's what you feel like.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.960
 And so in a lot of ways,

36:36.960 --> 36:40.900
 sometimes people with psychedelic experience on their own,

36:41.800 --> 36:44.040
 it can be harder to train them in this model

36:44.040 --> 36:45.880
 because in the real world,

36:45.880 --> 36:47.160
 people with psychedelic experience,

36:47.160 --> 36:48.960
 a lot of times the rule is, you know, hold your shit.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.720
 So several friends go to a party,

36:51.720 --> 36:53.100
 they split a bag of mushrooms.

36:53.100 --> 36:55.520
 It's like, you know, there's a social pressure

36:55.520 --> 36:58.760
 for good reason not to be the guy, you know,

36:58.760 --> 37:00.920
 in the corner of the room

37:00.920 --> 37:02.920
 where everyone's trying to just have a good time, relax,

37:02.920 --> 37:04.580
 like crying about your mother.

37:04.580 --> 37:07.080
 Your other friends are, they're having an experience too,

37:07.080 --> 37:09.600
 and you're being a drama king and blah, blah, blah.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.160
 And so like, yeah, compose yourself, hold your-

37:12.160 --> 37:14.600
 You're doing, I mean, you're doing therapy for people.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.360
 It's not just about the experience.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.920
 Right, and the experience itself is very much shaped

37:19.920 --> 37:23.360
 by that container, by the environment,

37:23.360 --> 37:26.280
 and the degree to which one allows it to happen.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.240
 Like one should let go of control.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.140
 Yeah, let's talk about the letting go of control.

37:32.140 --> 37:36.440
 And then as we march through this hypothetical experience

37:36.440 --> 37:38.480
 that does take place in your lab,

37:38.480 --> 37:42.320
 so we're using a sort of generic case example, if you will.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.560
 The letting go of control is an interesting feature,

37:45.560 --> 37:47.800
 actually, because one of the common themes

37:47.800 --> 37:51.340
 of good psychoanalysis or psychotherapy of any kind

37:51.340 --> 37:54.240
 is that there's a trust built between the patient

37:54.240 --> 37:58.620
 and the analyst, and that relationship becomes a template

37:58.620 --> 38:01.760
 for trust more generally and trust in oneself.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.680
 It's actually the end goal of good psychoanalysis

38:04.680 --> 38:07.080
 is that the patient actually, one of the end goals

38:07.080 --> 38:09.360
 is that they develop an empathy for themselves,

38:09.360 --> 38:11.240
 which almost sounds like an oxymoron,

38:11.240 --> 38:13.560
 but if you spend a little time with that statement,

38:13.560 --> 38:15.120
 it actually pans out.

38:15.120 --> 38:20.120
 So the psychedelic experience is one in which chemically

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
 you're under a new set of conditions, right?

38:26.400 --> 38:29.960
 Coarsely, space and time are altered in some way,

38:29.960 --> 38:31.560
 sense of self.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.800
 For instance, I might be going to a strongly

38:33.800 --> 38:36.620
 interoceptive mode where I'm focusing on everything

38:36.620 --> 38:37.920
 within the confines of my skin,

38:37.920 --> 38:40.320
 whereas normally we're sort of interacting in space

38:40.320 --> 38:42.520
 and pens and conversation, and I'm sort of,

38:42.520 --> 38:45.040
 if I had, occasionally I'll pay attention to my breathing,

38:45.040 --> 38:47.960
 but I'm sort of dilating and contracting my focus

38:47.960 --> 38:50.320
 for different things all the time.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.660
 The letting go of control, it seems to me,

38:53.660 --> 38:57.520
 could be sort of the expansion of one perceptual bubble

38:57.520 --> 39:01.240
 to the point where you're not actually worried

39:01.240 --> 39:03.600
 that that perceptual bubble is going to pop or that,

39:03.600 --> 39:06.960
 meaning you're not worried about what people think of you.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.640
 You're not worried whether or not your brain

39:09.640 --> 39:10.520
 is going to explode,

39:10.520 --> 39:12.720
 even though a thought could feel enormous.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.920
 If I keep going like this, it almost sounds psychedelic,

39:15.920 --> 39:18.040
 but that's the idea here.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.760
 Or if I'm paying attention, for instance,

39:19.760 --> 39:21.680
 to some somatic experience,

39:21.680 --> 39:26.620
 like the coursing of waves of heat through my body,

39:26.620 --> 39:30.520
 that I'm not suddenly saying, you know, is that weird?

39:30.520 --> 39:32.800
 I'm actually just going deeper and deeper into it.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.720
 So it's essentially expanding our perceptual phenomenon.

39:35.720 --> 39:39.200
 How do you convince people to go further

39:39.200 --> 39:40.660
 and further down that path?

39:40.660 --> 39:42.220
 What do you think allows them to do that?

39:42.220 --> 39:44.080
 Because I think that, to me,

39:44.080 --> 39:47.940
 is one of the more unusual aspects to psychedelics

39:47.940 --> 39:51.000
 is that normally the social pressure,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.420
 but also just our internal pressure from our own brain

39:54.420 --> 39:59.000
 is pay attention to many things at once, not just one.

39:59.000 --> 39:59.840
 Is that-

39:59.840 --> 40:00.660
 Especially these days.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.120
 Yeah, multitask.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.480
 Multitask, and the more that we focus on one thing,

40:05.480 --> 40:08.420
 the more bizarre that thing actually can appear to us, right?

40:08.420 --> 40:09.260
 Right.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.420
 I mean, even if it's the tip of your finger

40:10.420 --> 40:11.660
 and you're not taking any psychedelics,

40:11.660 --> 40:13.420
 you spend a long enough looking at the tip of your finger,

40:13.420 --> 40:16.940
 you will notice some very weird things, right?

40:16.940 --> 40:19.260
 I think of that as the classic psychedelic effect

40:19.260 --> 40:21.540
 or one classic effect,

40:21.540 --> 40:24.700
 and one I've used many times of this example

40:24.700 --> 40:28.300
 of why people shouldn't necessarily, you know,

40:28.300 --> 40:29.140
 these aren't,

40:31.380 --> 40:32.940
 one should be judicious

40:32.940 --> 40:35.140
 in putting themselves in these circumstances.

40:35.140 --> 40:37.420
 Someone could be, you know,

40:37.420 --> 40:40.480
 having a very strong psilocybin experience

40:40.480 --> 40:43.660
 and they're trying to navigate their way in Manhattan,

40:43.660 --> 40:44.620
 crossing the street,

40:44.620 --> 40:47.380
 and they might be staring into the hand and realize,

40:47.380 --> 40:50.740
 like that's, their hand is the most amazing miracle.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.500
 Like the entire universe has essentially conspired

40:53.500 --> 40:55.340
 to come to this one point

40:55.340 --> 40:57.600
 to make this absolutely breathtaking.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.680
 It's almost like, I think of the simplest form of,

41:00.680 --> 41:02.180
 well, we know that the simplest form of learning

41:02.180 --> 41:03.020
 is habituation.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.620
 Simply keep applying stimuli

41:04.620 --> 41:05.460
 and there's less response.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.340
 Like, this is what organisms do.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.620
 This is what we have to do.

41:08.620 --> 41:11.580
 And it's like, there's this dishabituation component

41:11.580 --> 41:12.420
 that like-

41:12.420 --> 41:13.240
 Dishabituation.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.800
 Yes, like we wouldn't be able to get through life

41:14.800 --> 41:16.500
 if we wouldn't be able to cross that street

41:16.500 --> 41:19.860
 if we were like, oh, like this is a miracle.

41:19.860 --> 41:21.260
 Well, I'm so glad you,

41:21.260 --> 41:22.700
 no, I'm so glad you brought this up.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.180
 I mean, here I'm reflecting my bias as a vision scientist,

41:25.180 --> 41:26.740
 but most people don't realize this,

41:26.740 --> 41:28.200
 but if you look at something long enough,

41:28.200 --> 41:30.460
 it eventually disappears.

41:30.460 --> 41:31.500
 It doesn't actually disappear,

41:31.500 --> 41:33.020
 but perceptually it disappears.

41:33.020 --> 41:35.040
 You have these little microsaccades that ensure

41:35.040 --> 41:36.100
 that it doesn't.

41:36.100 --> 41:39.820
 But most of us don't look at any one thing for very long.

41:39.820 --> 41:43.900
 The brain's default is to perceptually jump around

41:43.900 --> 41:45.740
 like crazy with the visual system,

41:45.740 --> 41:47.120
 with the auditory system.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.500
 We all, ADD, people talk about ADD a lot,

41:50.500 --> 41:53.620
 is sort of baked into our underlying networks at some level.

41:53.620 --> 41:56.000
 And then we can force attention.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.960
 But it sounds like in psychedelics,

41:57.960 --> 41:59.820
 one of the primary goals therapeutically

41:59.820 --> 42:03.580
 is to really drill into one of these perceptual bubbles

42:03.580 --> 42:04.860
 and expand that bubble.

42:04.860 --> 42:08.340
 And the safety it seems is the safety,

42:08.340 --> 42:11.260
 it's sort of like a permission to do that

42:11.260 --> 42:14.140
 without worrying that something's going to happen.

42:14.140 --> 42:17.420
 Right, because I've had people there on the couch.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.100
 Yeah, I remember one lady said,

42:20.100 --> 42:23.440
 this is probably 13, 14 years ago,

42:23.440 --> 42:26.420
 said, Matt, tell me again, I can't die.

42:26.420 --> 42:29.220
 I feel like my heart is going to rip through my chest.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.420
 I mean, she was feeling her.

42:30.420 --> 42:32.300
 And I should say, typically,

42:32.300 --> 42:34.700
 cardiovascular response is modest.

42:34.700 --> 42:38.420
 The pulse and blood pressure go up somewhat.

42:38.420 --> 42:39.720
 It can be dangerous for people

42:39.720 --> 42:41.100
 if they're at severe heart risk,

42:41.100 --> 42:41.940
 and we do monitor.

42:41.940 --> 42:42.760
 Are you monitoring this the whole time?

42:42.760 --> 42:43.600
 We do, yeah.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.460
 So they're plugged into a variety of devices.

42:45.460 --> 42:47.140
 Yeah, so every half hour or so,

42:47.140 --> 42:48.820
 we take their own protocol,

42:48.820 --> 42:51.300
 and we space it out a little further,

42:51.300 --> 42:52.740
 further into the time course.

42:52.740 --> 42:55.100
 But we take their blood pressure and their pulse.

42:55.100 --> 42:57.340
 And if it goes over a certain level, we have a protocol.

42:57.340 --> 42:58.620
 And we've had to do this only a few times.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.300
 But the physician comes in,

43:00.300 --> 43:02.600
 gives them a little nitroglycerin under the tongue,

43:02.600 --> 43:04.820
 and knocks the blood pressure down a little bit,

43:04.820 --> 43:05.980
 doesn't affect the experience.

43:05.980 --> 43:07.320
 So we have it all in place,

43:07.320 --> 43:08.420
 even though they'd probably be fine

43:08.420 --> 43:09.940
 out of an abundance of caution.

43:09.940 --> 43:11.780
 Sure.

43:11.780 --> 43:15.020
 But yeah, but someone can feel that,

43:15.020 --> 43:16.260
 my God, I'm going to die.

43:16.260 --> 43:21.180
 Like, I have never felt my heart beat like this before.

43:21.180 --> 43:23.260
 And the experience of the breath

43:23.260 --> 43:27.820
 can be just absolutely fantastic.

43:27.820 --> 43:29.900
 This sort of, and the breath is obviously interesting

43:29.900 --> 43:33.220
 because it's this automatic control,

43:33.220 --> 43:35.100
 but it can also be voluntary.

43:35.100 --> 43:37.180
 So people can get into a sense of like,

43:37.180 --> 43:38.780
 my God, what if I forget, what if I forget?

43:38.780 --> 43:39.620
 It sounds silly,

43:39.620 --> 43:40.820
 like a stoner movie. What if I forget to breathe?

43:40.820 --> 43:42.060
 Exactly.

43:42.060 --> 43:45.500
 But people, that can be so compelling.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.340
 And so one of the reasons,

43:46.340 --> 43:47.820
 and get back to one of your questions,

43:47.820 --> 43:50.780
 it's like, what do we do to kind of allow them

43:50.780 --> 43:52.540
 to go further into these bubbles?

43:52.540 --> 43:56.100
 It's like, one is wearing the eye shades.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.740
 We don't call them blindfolds

43:57.740 --> 44:00.300
 because that has a negative connotation like being kidnapped.

44:00.300 --> 44:02.140
 And they're probably seeing a lot in there anyway.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.820
 So blind isn't the appropriate word.

44:03.820 --> 44:05.260
 Right, right.

44:05.260 --> 44:06.100
 I've never thought of it.

44:06.100 --> 44:09.260
 These should be like inner sight shades.

44:09.260 --> 44:10.500
 But when you close the eyes,

44:10.500 --> 44:14.100
 the levels of activity in the retina actually are maintained.

44:14.100 --> 44:16.100
 It's just spontaneous activity.

44:16.100 --> 44:16.940
 And it seems,

44:16.940 --> 44:19.100
 and I'd be curious about your thoughts on this.

44:20.500 --> 44:25.500
 But the way I describe it is that the mind's eye,

44:25.500 --> 44:28.300
 meaning this kind of loose term we use,

44:28.300 --> 44:29.820
 can be on rocket boosters.

44:29.820 --> 44:31.980
 So a lot of times, for some people,

44:31.980 --> 44:33.260
 like a compound like psilocybin,

44:33.260 --> 44:37.340
 for some people, there's no perceptual effect.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.500
 Like if they're looking at this room,

44:38.500 --> 44:40.660
 it would pretty much look the same.

44:40.660 --> 44:41.500
 Sometimes folks say,

44:41.500 --> 44:42.860
 yeah, things seem a little bit brighter.

44:42.860 --> 44:44.300
 Now, some people will say,

44:44.300 --> 44:45.660
 oh my God, there's waves.

44:45.660 --> 44:48.780
 That wall is waving and these curtains are, you know.

44:48.780 --> 44:49.660
 On these compounds,

44:49.660 --> 44:51.380
 people don't typically see pink elephants.

44:51.380 --> 44:53.220
 You do actually get that in another class.

44:53.220 --> 44:56.540
 I didn't mention the anticholinergics,

44:56.540 --> 44:59.220
 sort of like atropine and scopolamine, those drugs.

44:59.220 --> 45:01.140
 Those are the true hallucinations

45:01.140 --> 45:03.220
 where you thought you were having a conversation

45:03.220 --> 45:04.820
 with someone who was never there.

45:06.980 --> 45:08.100
 We will definitely get to those.

45:08.100 --> 45:10.220
 But the reason I kind of cringe and say,

45:10.220 --> 45:11.780
 oh my, when you talked about those,

45:11.780 --> 45:14.220
 is that knowing a little bit

45:14.220 --> 45:16.540
 about the pharmacology of acetylcholine,

45:16.540 --> 45:19.900
 the idea of manipulating that system,

45:19.900 --> 45:22.420
 to me, sounds very uncomfortable.

45:22.420 --> 45:26.900
 Because like the whole idea of, well, witches and flying,

45:26.900 --> 45:28.620
 there was a whole history there, you know,

45:28.620 --> 45:31.100
 hundreds of years ago, so-called witches,

45:31.100 --> 45:33.900
 taking these agents and then thinking

45:33.900 --> 45:35.620
 they were flying around on broomsticks

45:35.620 --> 45:36.540
 and things of that sort.

45:36.540 --> 45:38.580
 And there's a lot of mythology around the broomsticks.

45:38.580 --> 45:41.500
 It's complicated, but that sounds very unpleasant.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.820
 One thing about the serotonergic,

45:43.820 --> 45:46.020
 let's just, with psilocybin.

45:46.020 --> 45:50.420
 So there's an expansion

45:50.420 --> 45:53.940
 of a particular fairly narrow percept.

45:53.940 --> 45:56.460
 It could be sound, could be an emotion, could be sadness,

45:56.460 --> 46:00.020
 could be a historical event or a fear of the future.

46:00.940 --> 46:04.180
 And you've mentioned before that there's something

46:04.180 --> 46:06.580
 to be learned in that experience.

46:06.580 --> 46:09.020
 There's something about going into that experience

46:09.020 --> 46:16.500
 in an undeterred way that allows somebody

46:16.500 --> 46:20.740
 to bring something back into more standard reality.

46:22.340 --> 46:25.060
 Given the huge variety of experiences

46:25.060 --> 46:26.500
 that people have on psychedelics,

46:26.500 --> 46:29.160
 given the huge variety of humans that are out there,

46:30.460 --> 46:33.260
 but what are now very clear therapeutic effects

46:33.260 --> 46:35.140
 in the realm of depression,

46:35.140 --> 46:39.740
 what do you think is the value of going into this

46:39.740 --> 46:42.020
 fairly restricted perceptual bubble,

46:42.020 --> 46:45.320
 what we are calling letting go or giving up control?

46:45.320 --> 46:47.840
 Because if the experiences are many,

46:47.840 --> 46:51.720
 but the value of what one exports from that experience

46:51.720 --> 46:54.580
 is kind of similar across individuals,

46:54.580 --> 46:56.820
 that raises all sorts of interesting questions.

46:56.820 --> 46:58.940
 And this is not a philosophy discussion.

46:58.940 --> 47:01.940
 We're talking about biology and psychology here.

47:01.940 --> 47:05.420
 So let's say I decide I'm going to focus on the tip

47:05.420 --> 47:06.260
 of my pen.

47:06.260 --> 47:07.780
 I mean, in a psychedelic state,

47:07.780 --> 47:09.120
 I could fall in love with this pen.

47:09.120 --> 47:12.260
 I do happen to like these Pilot V5s and V7s very much,

47:12.260 --> 47:16.200
 but I could feel real love for the pen, right?

47:16.200 --> 47:18.740
 That's not an unreasonable thing to expect

47:18.740 --> 47:20.180
 in a psychedelic journey.

47:20.180 --> 47:22.940
 And in the context of your laboratory model,

47:22.940 --> 47:24.380
 which I think is a great one,

47:24.380 --> 47:26.880
 that experience would be just as valid

47:26.880 --> 47:30.340
 as me going into the experience of some of the deep friction

47:30.340 --> 47:32.180
 that I might have with a family member

47:32.180 --> 47:34.080
 over my entire lifespan.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.780
 And yet the export from that,

47:36.780 --> 47:39.900
 those two vastly different experiences

47:39.900 --> 47:42.360
 is one of feeling a better relationship

47:42.360 --> 47:43.920
 to the world and to oneself.

47:43.920 --> 47:44.760
 So what does this tell us about-

47:44.760 --> 47:46.940
 Like how can the pen and the processing

47:46.940 --> 47:49.200
 your childhood trauma both lead to?

47:49.200 --> 47:50.040
 Right.

47:50.040 --> 47:53.180
 So what does this, I mean, at that level,

47:53.180 --> 47:57.980
 it raises this question like, first of all, how, why,

47:57.980 --> 48:00.060
 I mean, or just what are your thoughts on that?

48:00.060 --> 48:02.080
 So this is definitely in the,

48:02.080 --> 48:04.760
 this is in the terrain we're figuring out, you know?

48:04.760 --> 48:07.060
 So there's no, educated speculation

48:07.060 --> 48:08.660
 is the best I can provide.

48:08.660 --> 48:13.660
 But I think the best, the most,

48:14.540 --> 48:16.860
 I think the common denominator

48:16.860 --> 48:20.900
 are persisting changes in self-representation.

48:20.900 --> 48:23.100
 Okay, tell me more about self-representation.

48:23.100 --> 48:27.660
 That's the way one holds the sense of self,

48:27.660 --> 48:31.920
 the fundamental relationship of a person in the world.

48:31.920 --> 48:34.780
 I mentioned earlier that these experience

48:34.780 --> 48:37.500
 seems to alter the models we hold of reality.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.540
 And I think that the self is the biggest model,

48:39.540 --> 48:42.300
 that I am a thing that's separate from other things.

48:42.300 --> 48:46.420
 And that's, I am defined by certain,

48:46.420 --> 48:49.260
 I have a certain personality and I'm a smoker

48:49.260 --> 48:50.520
 that's having a hard time quitting,

48:50.520 --> 48:53.540
 or I'm a depressed person that, you know,

48:53.540 --> 48:55.580
 views myself as a failure and all of these things.

48:55.580 --> 48:56.820
 Those are models too.

48:56.820 --> 49:01.420
 And I think, I think that change in self-representation

49:01.420 --> 49:04.020
 may be an end point for these different experiences.

49:04.020 --> 49:06.940
 I mean, maybe the falling in love with the pen,

49:06.940 --> 49:08.260
 the whole idea that you're,

49:09.220 --> 49:10.920
 especially in contemplation afterwards,

49:10.920 --> 49:12.300
 and obviously I'm speculating here,

49:12.300 --> 49:14.580
 but the whole idea that you could

49:14.580 --> 49:18.060
 have such a deep connection with this random,

49:18.060 --> 49:21.700
 obviously random aspect of the universe

49:21.700 --> 49:24.620
 could potentially lead to this, you know,

49:24.620 --> 49:27.580
 transformed understanding of the self and like,

49:27.580 --> 49:31.580
 the pen may be a proxy for the miracle of reality,

49:31.580 --> 49:34.260
 in a way that relies nothing on,

49:34.260 --> 49:36.620
 on no supernatural thinking, you know,

49:36.620 --> 49:38.940
 you can be a hard atheist and take this,

49:38.940 --> 49:40.820
 ultimately, oh my God, like that,

49:40.820 --> 49:43.220
 just like the pen, this is, you know,

49:43.220 --> 49:45.580
 this is amazing, the fact that we exist.

49:45.580 --> 49:48.040
 And so there could be an extrapolation chair

49:48.040 --> 49:50.500
 and you use the pen, but I think it sounds so similar

49:50.500 --> 49:52.940
 to Aldous Huxley's classic description

49:52.940 --> 49:55.860
 on the doors of perception of the chair and the drapes.

49:55.860 --> 49:59.220
 Like he took 500 milligrams of mescaline.

49:59.220 --> 50:00.060
 He was just like-

50:00.060 --> 50:01.140
 Is that a high dose of mescaline?

50:01.140 --> 50:02.140
 Yeah, yeah.

50:02.140 --> 50:06.460
 And that's, you know, that's a heroic dose for sure.

50:06.460 --> 50:09.280
 And he just going off on the chairiness of the chair,

50:09.280 --> 50:13.260
 like this chair is exuding the quality of being a chair.

50:13.260 --> 50:16.120
 So this is this expansion of the perceptual bubble,

50:16.120 --> 50:19.980
 a narrow, a narrow percept that then grows

50:19.980 --> 50:23.100
 within the confines of that narrow percept.

50:23.100 --> 50:23.980
 Yeah.

50:23.980 --> 50:27.100
 So sense of self is a very interesting phenomenon.

50:27.100 --> 50:29.060
 And if we could dissect it a little bit,

50:29.940 --> 50:31.640
 there's the somatic sense of self.

50:31.640 --> 50:34.620
 So the ability to literally feel the self

50:34.620 --> 50:36.780
 into this process we call interoception.

50:36.780 --> 50:41.020
 And then there's the title of the self, the I am blank.

50:41.020 --> 50:41.860
 Yeah.

50:41.860 --> 50:42.740
 And I noticed you said that several times.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.900
 It's intriguing to me, I have a good friend.

50:44.900 --> 50:47.620
 I don't think I can or should mention his name,

50:47.620 --> 50:50.140
 but he had a very long and successful career

50:51.140 --> 50:52.700
 within one of the more elite teams

50:52.700 --> 50:53.980
 and within the SEAL teams.

50:53.980 --> 50:57.860
 And he's a fairly philosophical guy,

50:57.860 --> 50:59.460
 also very practical guy,

50:59.460 --> 51:03.700
 but he has said many times to me

51:03.700 --> 51:08.700
 that the most powerful words in any language are I am,

51:08.820 --> 51:10.860
 because whatever follows that,

51:10.860 --> 51:12.580
 tends, if you repeat it enough,

51:12.580 --> 51:15.380
 tends to have this kind of feedback effect

51:15.380 --> 51:17.820
 on how you are in the world.

51:17.820 --> 51:21.460
 And the first pass, it sounded to me a little bit

51:21.460 --> 51:24.940
 like kind of like internet psychology type thing,

51:24.940 --> 51:26.260
 like the secret or something to say,

51:26.260 --> 51:28.500
 which frankly I'm just not particularly.

51:28.500 --> 51:30.920
 Yeah, so if you kind of like the whole fake it

51:30.920 --> 51:31.760
 till you make it,

51:31.760 --> 51:34.460
 like I don't actually subscribe to any of that.

51:34.460 --> 51:36.660
 But in dissecting that a little bit further with him,

51:36.660 --> 51:41.080
 I came to realize that these words I am are very powerful.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.660
 I don't think you reprogram your brain just by saying them,

51:43.660 --> 51:48.660
 but how one defines themselves internally,

51:49.700 --> 51:51.260
 not just to other people,

51:51.260 --> 51:54.300
 but how one psychologically and by default

51:54.300 --> 51:57.220
 defines themselves, I think is a very powerful,

51:57.220 --> 51:59.940
 like and depressed people,

51:59.940 --> 52:02.020
 as well as happy people seem to define themselves

52:02.020 --> 52:04.780
 in terms of these categories of emotional states.

52:04.780 --> 52:09.060
 So I think it's so interesting that letting go

52:09.060 --> 52:10.960
 and going into this perceptual bubble,

52:10.960 --> 52:14.540
 which is facilitated by obviously a really wonderful team

52:14.540 --> 52:17.780
 of therapists, but also the serotonergic agent

52:17.780 --> 52:22.780
 allows us to potentially reshape the perception of self.

52:22.960 --> 52:26.420
 That's a tremendous feat of neuroplasticity.

52:26.420 --> 52:30.700
 Right, and I think certainly more work needs to be done.

52:30.700 --> 52:33.020
 This is the horizon.

52:33.020 --> 52:36.820
 And I should credit Chris Lethaby, a philosopher

52:36.820 --> 52:40.220
 in Australia who has a forthcoming book.

52:40.220 --> 52:42.660
 It might be out right about now or soon,

52:42.660 --> 52:47.260
 within the coming months, Psychedelics and Philosophy.

52:47.260 --> 52:49.340
 That's the title of the book.

52:49.340 --> 52:51.100
 It might be Psychedelic Philosophy.

52:51.100 --> 52:51.940
 It's really close.

52:51.940 --> 52:53.780
 Chris Lethaby, we'll put a link to it.

52:53.780 --> 52:56.300
 Right, and so his conclusion in this,

52:56.300 --> 52:59.580
 it's a really great book and he really plays with the idea.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.480
 It's like psychedelic experiences come along

53:01.480 --> 53:05.460
 with a lot of supernatural stuff, experience.

53:05.460 --> 53:06.940
 It can certainly go along with that,

53:06.940 --> 53:09.820
 but the idea is like, can these experiences

53:09.820 --> 53:11.380
 and including those therapeutic effects

53:11.380 --> 53:14.900
 be explained from a naturalist point of view?

53:14.900 --> 53:18.180
 And his conclusion is that the changes

53:18.180 --> 53:20.820
 in self-representation may be the commonality.

53:20.820 --> 53:23.820
 Now that could go along with plant spirits

53:23.820 --> 53:28.700
 and the Buddha and chakras and whatever your model,

53:28.700 --> 53:32.140
 you know, system in Jesus, all of that,

53:32.140 --> 53:34.940
 but it could also be completely devoid

53:34.940 --> 53:37.460
 of any supernatural, any religious.

53:37.460 --> 53:41.860
 And we do, in fact, see all of these varieties.

53:41.860 --> 53:43.900
 So I think there's something about this change

53:43.900 --> 53:45.780
 in sense of self.

53:45.780 --> 53:48.140
 There seems to be something on the identity level,

53:48.140 --> 53:49.940
 both with, I think, of the work we did

53:49.940 --> 53:52.260
 with cancer patients who had substantial depression

53:52.260 --> 53:53.940
 and anxiety because of their cancer,

53:53.940 --> 53:55.020
 and also our work with people

53:55.020 --> 53:57.540
 trying to quit cigarette smoking.

53:57.540 --> 54:00.780
 I mean, there's this real,

54:00.780 --> 54:02.520
 there seems to be, when it really works,

54:02.520 --> 54:06.340
 this change in how people view themselves,

54:06.340 --> 54:11.340
 like with smoking, like really stepping out of this model,

54:11.540 --> 54:15.620
 like I'm a smoker, it's tough to quit smoking cigarettes,

54:15.620 --> 54:18.420
 I can't do it, I failed a bunch of times.

54:18.420 --> 54:20.780
 I remember one participant during the session,

54:20.780 --> 54:22.580
 but he held onto this afterwards, said,

54:22.580 --> 54:26.780
 my God, it's like, I can really just decide,

54:26.780 --> 54:29.420
 like flicking off a bucket, I can decide not to smoke.

54:29.420 --> 54:32.420
 And it's, I call these duh experiences with psychedelics

54:32.420 --> 54:34.820
 because people often, like in the cancer study,

54:34.820 --> 54:38.160
 they say, I'm causing most of my own suffering.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.820
 Like I can follow my appointments, I can do everything,

54:40.820 --> 54:42.020
 but I can still plan for the vacation,

54:42.020 --> 54:44.860
 I'm not getting outside in the sunshine,

54:44.860 --> 54:47.660
 I'm not playing with my grandkids, I'm choosing to do that.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.020
 And it's like, they told themselves that before,

54:50.020 --> 54:52.900
 and the smoker has told themselves a million times,

54:52.900 --> 54:56.140
 I can, so it sounds, when it comes out of their mouths,

54:56.140 --> 54:58.340
 and folks will say, this is part of the ineffability

54:58.340 --> 55:00.080
 of a psychedelic experience, folks say,

55:00.080 --> 55:02.340
 I know this sounds like bullshit, and this sounds like,

55:02.340 --> 55:05.420
 but my God, I could just decide.

55:05.420 --> 55:08.980
 Like, they're feeling this gravity of agency,

55:08.980 --> 55:10.100
 which I think is interesting,

55:10.100 --> 55:13.980
 because regardless of the debates

55:13.980 --> 55:15.660
 on the reality of free will,

55:15.660 --> 55:18.300
 I think the philosophy of that,

55:18.300 --> 55:22.180
 whether it's ultimately free will, like pure agency,

55:22.180 --> 55:24.320
 if that exists, which I'm skeptical of,

55:24.320 --> 55:28.600
 or just the idea that clearly we have a sense of agency,

55:28.600 --> 55:30.360
 there's something there,

55:30.360 --> 55:32.840
 whether it's the sense of agency even,

55:32.840 --> 55:35.540
 that is the human being has,

55:35.540 --> 55:40.540
 and that seems to be at times fundamentally like supercharged

55:41.480 --> 55:44.180
 from a psychedelic experience, this idea like,

55:44.180 --> 55:46.740
 I'm just going to make a decision.

55:46.740 --> 55:48.620
 Like normally, like you tell a depressed person,

55:48.620 --> 55:50.300
 like, don't think of yourself that way,

55:50.300 --> 55:52.460
 you're not a failure, look at all the, it's just, yeah,

55:52.460 --> 55:55.700
 it's like, and you can actually, in one of these states,

55:55.700 --> 55:57.880
 have an experience where you realize like, my God,

55:57.880 --> 56:00.460
 just like using MDMA to treat PTSD,

56:00.460 --> 56:02.020
 and we're going to be starting work with psilocybin

56:02.020 --> 56:03.100
 to treat PTSD,

56:03.100 --> 56:06.740
 someone could really reprocess their trauma

56:06.740 --> 56:09.740
 in a way that like has lasting effects,

56:09.740 --> 56:11.640
 and clearly there's probably something, you know,

56:11.640 --> 56:14.060
 reconsolidation of those memories,

56:14.060 --> 56:17.060
 they are altered, you know,

56:17.060 --> 56:19.260
 very consistent with our understanding

56:19.260 --> 56:20.360
 of the way memory works.

56:20.360 --> 56:24.740
 So the whole idea, people can actually, in a few hours,

56:24.740 --> 56:26.440
 have such a profound experience

56:26.440 --> 56:31.100
 that they decide to make these changes in who they are,

56:31.100 --> 56:32.620
 and it sticks.

56:32.620 --> 56:34.340
 There seems to be something like that.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.460
 And that's profound.

56:35.460 --> 56:38.680
 I mean, I think a few moments ago,

56:38.680 --> 56:41.400
 I made some semi-disparaging statements

56:41.400 --> 56:43.860
 about things like the secret and affirmations,

56:43.860 --> 56:48.700
 and the reason I do that with a nod to the fact

56:48.700 --> 56:51.460
 that the people who are putting those ideas forward

56:51.460 --> 56:53.100
 are well-intentioned people

56:53.100 --> 56:58.100
 is that the neural networks of the brain put language last.

56:59.660 --> 57:03.060
 We tell stories, you know, and stories are very powerful,

57:03.060 --> 57:07.680
 but I think one of the most cruel aspects

57:07.680 --> 57:11.900
 of the whole self-help literature in popular psychology

57:11.900 --> 57:13.880
 is this idea that everything you say,

57:13.880 --> 57:15.820
 your brain and body hear it.

57:15.820 --> 57:19.260
 That's actually a very unkind or even cruel thing

57:19.260 --> 57:22.060
 for people who are depressed or anxious to hear,

57:22.060 --> 57:24.060
 because if they hear that and believe that,

57:24.060 --> 57:26.260
 and I want to be clear, I don't think it's true,

57:26.260 --> 57:30.600
 that they think that it's very hard to control thoughts.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.500
 Is it very hard to control thoughts?

57:32.500 --> 57:35.240
 So if somebody says, you know, I can't,

57:35.240 --> 57:36.540
 and then somebody says, well, no,

57:36.540 --> 57:37.700
 every time you say you can't,

57:37.700 --> 57:39.500
 your brain hears that and it reinforces it,

57:39.500 --> 57:41.760
 that's a very treacherous place to live.

57:42.760 --> 57:47.760
 And language is powerful, but neural networks, the brain,

57:48.980 --> 57:51.880
 and the networks that underlie emotionality and perception

57:51.880 --> 57:56.020
 and sense of self, they don't change in response to language.

57:56.020 --> 57:59.240
 They change in response to experience.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.660
 And it just fundamentally, you need,

58:01.660 --> 58:02.700
 there are some prerequisites.

58:02.700 --> 58:04.660
 You need certain neuromodulators present,

58:04.660 --> 58:06.500
 like serotonin or dopamine.

58:06.500 --> 58:08.260
 You need them to be at sufficient levels.

58:08.260 --> 58:09.900
 You don't need a drug necessarily to do it.

58:09.900 --> 58:13.540
 You could, you know, you give a kid a kitten or a puppy,

58:13.540 --> 58:14.820
 their first kitten or puppy,

58:14.820 --> 58:17.740
 and the levels of dopamine and serotonin,

58:17.740 --> 58:18.580
 I've never measured them,

58:18.580 --> 58:20.620
 but we can be pretty sure that they are higher

58:20.620 --> 58:24.940
 than baseline and that experience will reshape them, right?

58:24.940 --> 58:28.280
 Likewise with an adult in certain circumstances.

58:28.280 --> 58:31.420
 So I think I'm fascinated by this idea

58:31.420 --> 58:35.900
 that a somatic and a perceptual experience,

58:35.900 --> 58:39.400
 but a real experience of the sort that you're describing

58:39.400 --> 58:41.900
 is what allows us to reshape our neural circuitry

58:41.900 --> 58:43.780
 and to feel differently about ourselves.

58:43.780 --> 58:48.700
 And I know there's been really tremendous success

58:48.700 --> 58:52.460
 in many individuals of alleviating depression,

58:52.460 --> 58:55.140
 of treating trauma with these different compounds.

58:55.140 --> 58:59.200
 I want to step from the experience

58:59.200 --> 59:01.600
 under the effects of the psychedelic.

59:01.600 --> 59:03.300
 So the person there with your team,

59:03.300 --> 59:05.860
 they go into this expanded perceptual bubble.

59:05.860 --> 59:08.020
 If things go well,

59:08.020 --> 59:10.040
 they're able to do that to a really deep degree.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.360
 Maybe it's the relive trauma.

59:12.360 --> 59:14.580
 Maybe it's the beauty of their ability

59:14.580 --> 59:16.920
 to connect to things in the world.

59:16.920 --> 59:19.900
 And I want to talk about the transition out of that state

59:19.900 --> 59:21.980
 and then the export into life,

59:21.980 --> 59:24.340
 because this is really where the power of psychedelics

59:24.340 --> 59:26.460
 seems to be in the therapeutic sense

59:26.460 --> 59:29.560
 is the ability to learn, truly learn from that experience

59:29.560 --> 59:31.880
 so that the learning becomes the default,

59:31.880 --> 59:33.320
 that one doesn't have to remind themselves,

59:33.320 --> 59:35.940
 oh, I am, you know, they don't have to do an affirmation.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.080
 I am a happy person.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.940
 I am a happy, you know, I always think of Bart Simpson

59:38.940 --> 59:40.580
 like writing on the chalkboard, right?

59:40.580 --> 59:41.420
 Didn't work for him.

59:41.420 --> 59:43.300
 Doesn't work for this other stuff too.

59:43.300 --> 59:46.380
 But so as they transition out of this state,

59:46.380 --> 59:47.740
 I know that there's a kind of a heightened,

59:47.740 --> 59:49.380
 there's a so-called peak

59:49.380 --> 59:51.800
 where everything seems to be kind of cascading in

59:51.800 --> 59:55.820
 at such a level that the person just,

59:55.820 --> 59:57.620
 they can't really turn it off at that point.

59:57.620 --> 59:58.820
 It would be challenging.

59:59.880 --> 1:00:04.880
 And then they start to exit the effects of the drug.

1:00:05.180 --> 1:00:08.200
 Are those transition zones, are those valuable,

1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:09.940
 much like is the transition

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:12.820
 between a dream and the waking state valuable?

1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:16.540
 Because you're in a sort of mishmash of altered reality

1:00:16.540 --> 1:00:18.340
 and new reality.

1:00:18.340 --> 1:00:21.460
 What do you do to guide people through the,

1:00:22.940 --> 1:00:25.220
 out the tunnel as they exit the tunnel?

1:00:25.220 --> 1:00:26.100
 And I have to say,

1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:30.180
 like this is where we need more experimentation.

1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:32.400
 Really the clinical model goes back

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:35.940
 to literally the late 1950s.

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:39.400
 And there's been virtually no experimentation on,

1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:42.020
 let's say, you know, randomize people to,

1:00:42.020 --> 1:00:44.020
 we're going to talk more during the latter half

1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:46.060
 of the session versus not,

1:00:46.060 --> 1:00:48.580
 versus we have them write an essay

1:00:48.580 --> 1:00:50.140
 after their session versus not,

1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:52.340
 versus we have this amount of integration.

1:00:52.340 --> 1:00:53.500
 What's the discussion?

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:55.940
 In your studies, are they writing or talking

1:00:55.940 --> 1:00:56.780
 as they're doing it?

1:00:56.780 --> 1:01:00.620
 And it's called very loosey-goosey term integration,

1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:05.620
 but for us means as they're coming back from the experience

1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:08.060
 to sort of five, six hours in,

1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:09.180
 so this is the afternoon,

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:10.640
 they've been dosed around nine o'clock,

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:13.140
 so this is like four o'clock or so.

1:01:13.140 --> 1:01:13.980
 Just some initial,

1:01:13.980 --> 1:01:15.380
 tell us about the experience.

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:17.300
 Do you want to not unpacking it totally,

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:19.460
 but kind of initially just have a little bit discussion

1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:20.300
 before they go home.

1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:21.820
 So there's a little bit of that,

1:01:21.820 --> 1:01:25.460
 but then that night their homework is to write something.

1:01:25.460 --> 1:01:27.700
 So it could be, you know, a few bullet points.

1:01:27.700 --> 1:01:30.420
 It could be, you know, 20 pages

1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:33.980
 and we get everything, you know, in that range,

1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:36.900
 but, you know, try not to be self-critical.

1:01:36.900 --> 1:01:39.720
 It's not great at like, this is just to process.

1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:41.560
 And for a point of discussion the next day.

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:44.000
 So they write something, they come in the next day

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.940
 for a one to two hour,

1:01:45.940 --> 1:01:48.140
 depending on the study, integration session.

1:01:48.140 --> 1:01:51.360
 Basically, let's discuss your experience

1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.440
 and depending on what study it's in,

1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:57.160
 like what might that mean for your dealing with cancer?

1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:59.460
 What might that mean for your smoking?

1:02:00.460 --> 1:02:02.460
 Or becoming a non-smoker?

1:02:02.460 --> 1:02:04.940
 So you encourage them to simply take it seriously.

1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:06.380
 And I think this is, again,

1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:08.380
 is sort of one of the points

1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:09.840
 that could be the antithesis

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:13.860
 of what some just kind of social users use.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:17.260
 I mean, this was written about by Houston Smith,

1:02:17.260 --> 1:02:18.300
 the scholar of religion,

1:02:18.300 --> 1:02:20.780
 in terms of these mystical experiences

1:02:20.780 --> 1:02:22.180
 that can happen from psychedelics

1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:24.860
 and how a lot of times the attribution

1:02:24.860 --> 1:02:26.740
 to a drug effect is dismissed.

1:02:26.740 --> 1:02:30.540
 Like even if one has this, you know,

1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:32.120
 this sense of being one with the universe

1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.900
 and it totally like shakes their soul, so to speak,

1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:36.600
 you know, but the next day their friends are like,

1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:38.820
 ah, dude, you were screwed up.

1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:40.740
 Too much acid for you, woo.

1:02:40.740 --> 1:02:42.380
 You know, like, man, next time

1:02:42.380 --> 1:02:44.940
 you needed to have a few more beers to like bring that down.

1:02:44.940 --> 1:02:48.460
 You know, like this sort of like, you know,

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.960
 social, you know, reinforcement

1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.860
 for dismissing the experience.

1:02:52.860 --> 1:02:55.040
 Oh God, you're talking out of your head, man.

1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:58.180
 Like, you know, even if it's, you know, good natured,

1:02:58.180 --> 1:03:01.820
 but it's this dismissal, it's not like, you know,

1:03:01.820 --> 1:03:03.620
 what you want to do, you know,

1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:05.300
 is like, tell me more about that.

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:07.040
 You know, you were crying at one point,

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:10.300
 like in talking about your mom, let's talk about that.

1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:11.140
 What was that like?

1:03:11.140 --> 1:03:12.140
 Do you remember that?

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.740
 Are you doing that follow-up

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:16.660
 or they're encouraged to do that in their own life

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:18.060
 with the various people in their life?

1:03:18.060 --> 1:03:20.900
 Both, so we do that explicitly in the follow-up

1:03:20.900 --> 1:03:22.260
 where we have these discussions.

1:03:22.260 --> 1:03:26.540
 And I, depending on what the situation is,

1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:29.780
 you might encourage the person to kind of follow up.

1:03:29.780 --> 1:03:34.780
 It's really, the basics of it is supportive therapy.

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:37.380
 It's non-structured.

1:03:37.380 --> 1:03:40.140
 It's, you know, use all the, you know, reflective listening

1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:42.540
 and the sort of the humanistic psychology thing,

1:03:42.540 --> 1:03:45.220
 you know, unconditional positive regard for the person.

1:03:45.220 --> 1:03:48.940
 But, you know, I think if, you know,

1:03:48.940 --> 1:03:51.660
 if someone feels inclined to, you know,

1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:56.660
 apologize to their sibling about something,

1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:58.440
 it's like, yeah, go ahead and call them up.

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:01.160
 When it, with something big, like a relationship change,

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:04.140
 I'd be like, sit on that two weeks.

1:04:04.140 --> 1:04:06.540
 Don't make any big, don't end any relationship.

1:04:06.540 --> 1:04:07.580
 Don't quit your job.

1:04:07.580 --> 1:04:08.580
 Don't make any big-

1:04:08.580 --> 1:04:11.280
 Do you also tell them not to start any relationships?

1:04:13.820 --> 1:04:15.740
 I don't remember that ever coming up.

1:04:15.740 --> 1:04:16.580
 Interesting.

1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:17.420
 But if it-

1:04:17.420 --> 1:04:18.240
 I'm not Joey.

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:19.880
 I was just wondering, you know, but it makes sense

1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:20.720
 why you move on.

1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:21.840
 Like if they're dating and they're thinking like,

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:24.260
 ah, it might be time to take it to the next level.

1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:26.260
 Should I ask this girl to marry me?

1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:29.260
 If it did come up, I would say there too.

1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:30.580
 Why don't you sit on that a week or two

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:32.420
 and let your sober mind-

1:04:32.420 --> 1:04:33.420
 Don't get a puppy.

1:04:33.420 --> 1:04:36.180
 Certainly don't get four puppies until you're-

1:04:36.180 --> 1:04:40.240
 I have a question about flashbacks.

1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:41.080
 Uh-huh.

1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:43.700
 You know, one of the kind of things you hear is,

1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:46.020
 you know, flashbacks and that people,

1:04:46.020 --> 1:04:47.620
 do people get flashbacks?

1:04:47.620 --> 1:04:49.700
 And if so, what is the basis of flashbacks?

1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:54.700
 The on the street lore about this

1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:58.380
 is that somehow some of the compound gets stored

1:04:58.380 --> 1:05:00.460
 in body fat tissues and then released later.

1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:02.900
 Like is that complete nonsense?

1:05:02.900 --> 1:05:04.280
 No evidence for that.

1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:06.460
 So probably complete nonsense.

1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:08.920
 Flashbacks are nonsense or the storage in body fat

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:09.760
 is complete nonsense?

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:11.020
 The storage in body fat.

1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:14.340
 So to answer whether flashbacks are complete nonsense,

1:05:14.340 --> 1:05:15.420
 we have to define it.

1:05:15.420 --> 1:05:17.660
 So I really think these are multiple constructs

1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:18.480
 that are going on.

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:21.620
 It's not the same thing that fall under that term.

1:05:21.620 --> 1:05:25.460
 There is a phenomenon that appears real

1:05:25.460 --> 1:05:28.420
 that's called hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder.

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:30.420
 It's in the DSM.

1:05:30.420 --> 1:05:32.300
 A certain number of people,

1:05:32.300 --> 1:05:35.760
 very small number of people percentage wise

1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.100
 who have used psychedelics

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:40.140
 will have these persisting perceptual disorders.

1:05:40.140 --> 1:05:41.760
 Like they'll see halos around things.

1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:44.120
 They'll see some trails, like, you know,

1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:47.420
 like the after images following an object in motion.

1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:51.300
 They'll see distortions in color.

1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:53.420
 And it'll be like anything else

1:05:53.420 --> 1:05:55.660
 that's a disorder in the DSM.

1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:57.180
 It has to be clinically distressing

1:05:57.180 --> 1:06:01.340
 and it has to be persisting over some number of months.

1:06:01.340 --> 1:06:04.900
 And so very rare, very mysterious.

1:06:04.900 --> 1:06:08.440
 Some of the keys to that are amazingly,

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:11.460
 it's never been seen in the thousands of participants

1:06:11.460 --> 1:06:12.700
 either from the older era,

1:06:12.700 --> 1:06:15.580
 from the late fifties to the early seventies,

1:06:15.580 --> 1:06:18.460
 people in psychedelic studies with LSD, psilocybin, masculine

1:06:18.460 --> 1:06:20.140
 and it's never been seen in the modern era.

1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:22.700
 Again, now with thousands of participants

1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:26.540
 at a number of centers like ours throughout the world.

1:06:26.540 --> 1:06:30.500
 So it seems to be something that is

1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:33.860
 for some reason happening in illicit use.

1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:38.260
 So that brings in, okay, is there polypharmacology?

1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:39.940
 You know, like, cause you're drinking during it.

1:06:39.940 --> 1:06:40.940
 Did you take what you thought you'd do?

1:06:40.940 --> 1:06:43.460
 Yeah, what's the dose, what's the purity?

1:06:43.460 --> 1:06:46.660
 But then also what I think is actually even more so

1:06:46.660 --> 1:06:48.100
 than that what's likely going on

1:06:48.100 --> 1:06:51.020
 is some sort of very rare neurological susceptibility.

1:06:51.020 --> 1:06:55.420
 There is one paper that is a case series

1:06:55.420 --> 1:06:57.180
 of individuals reporting these symptoms

1:06:57.180 --> 1:06:59.900
 and they didn't limit it to just people

1:06:59.900 --> 1:07:02.620
 who had had hallucinogen history.

1:07:02.620 --> 1:07:05.700
 And the amazing thing about this is that

1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:10.620
 a number of people seem to have straight up HPPD diagnosis.

1:07:10.620 --> 1:07:11.780
 What is HPPD?

1:07:11.780 --> 1:07:14.060
 Hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder

1:07:14.060 --> 1:07:16.040
 who have never taken a psychedelic.

1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:20.940
 So it's often prompted by alcohol,

1:07:20.940 --> 1:07:25.660
 benzodiazepines, cannabis, even tobacco.

1:07:25.660 --> 1:07:29.460
 And I believe in one individual,

1:07:29.460 --> 1:07:31.180
 no lifetime history of any,

1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:35.860
 it wasn't preceded by any of those substance use.

1:07:35.860 --> 1:07:40.860
 So I think of it like the precipitation exacerbation

1:07:41.300 --> 1:07:42.660
 of psychotic disorders.

1:07:42.660 --> 1:07:44.740
 It seems pretty clear through observation

1:07:44.740 --> 1:07:47.940
 that some people with either predisposition

1:07:47.940 --> 1:07:49.860
 or active psychotic disease

1:07:49.860 --> 1:07:51.740
 that this can destabilize them.

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:54.300
 The same way that a life experience

1:07:54.300 --> 1:07:56.380
 can destabilize those person more easily,

1:07:56.380 --> 1:07:57.640
 I think of it like that there's probably

1:07:57.640 --> 1:08:00.660
 some pretty rare neurological susceptibility.

1:08:00.660 --> 1:08:03.580
 We have tended, going this goes back to the 80s,

1:08:05.020 --> 1:08:07.540
 clinical practice, it ended up in the DSM

1:08:07.540 --> 1:08:11.440
 focused on hallucinogen because I relate it

1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:13.820
 to the psychology of xenophobia.

1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:16.780
 It's always the weird other thing that gets the attribution.

1:08:16.780 --> 1:08:19.080
 You don't attribute to the thing like,

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:20.620
 oh yeah, did you smoke cigarettes?

1:08:20.620 --> 1:08:21.460
 Did you drink?

1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:23.660
 It's like, well, yeah, but I see lots of people drinking

1:08:23.660 --> 1:08:25.020
 and not ending up with this.

1:08:25.020 --> 1:08:29.140
 Like you take a crazy like drug

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:32.220
 and you can get people to believe all sorts of crazy stuff.

1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:35.420
 The biggest example of that is the cathinone derivatives,

1:08:35.420 --> 1:08:36.900
 so-called bath salts.

1:08:36.900 --> 1:08:39.140
 And if you remember several years back,

1:08:39.140 --> 1:08:42.820
 the guy in Florida that ate the other guy's face,

1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:44.980
 there was a homeless guy that like literally

1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:47.340
 ate part of someone's face off, like yeah.

1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:48.180
 It's one of the crazies.

1:08:48.180 --> 1:08:49.020
 While the person was alive.

1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:50.500
 While the person was alive.

1:08:50.500 --> 1:08:53.740
 And all it took was one sheriff's deputy to say,

1:08:53.740 --> 1:08:55.860
 well, I don't know, but I bet it was

1:08:55.860 --> 1:08:58.500
 some of that bath salts stuff that's been going on.

1:08:58.500 --> 1:08:59.340
 The only thing-

1:08:59.340 --> 1:09:00.700
 What was it?

1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:01.660
 The only thing in his system-

1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:03.540
 Maybe we can set the record straight for people.

1:09:03.540 --> 1:09:06.700
 What was the, why would he say bath salts?

1:09:06.700 --> 1:09:08.420
 And was it bath salts?

1:09:08.420 --> 1:09:09.620
 It wasn't.

1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:12.420
 And so the only thing in his talks was cannabis,

1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:14.540
 which we all know,

1:09:14.540 --> 1:09:16.580
 typically people don't eat people's faces off

1:09:16.580 --> 1:09:17.420
 after they get stuff-

1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:19.180
 Makes you hungrier, but not that hungry.

1:09:19.180 --> 1:09:20.100
 Right, right.

1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:22.860
 So it's just an example of the xenophobia.

1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:24.900
 Like today, if you get on Google Images

1:09:24.900 --> 1:09:26.500
 and look up bath salts,

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:29.140
 one of the most common images you'll see

1:09:29.140 --> 1:09:31.420
 is this poor guy's face being eaten off.

1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:33.540
 So we're just so ready to latch on,

1:09:33.540 --> 1:09:36.140
 just like the people of another culture

1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:36.980
 that we don't know of.

1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:41.980
 It's very easy to assign attribution to a class

1:09:41.980 --> 1:09:43.300
 that you're very unfamiliar with.

1:09:43.300 --> 1:09:46.460
 So I think the psychedelics got that attribution

1:09:46.460 --> 1:09:50.100
 with this very rare neurological susceptibility,

1:09:50.100 --> 1:09:51.540
 the way that alcohol didn't.

1:09:51.540 --> 1:09:54.780
 So I think it's not specific to psychedelics,

1:09:54.780 --> 1:09:56.980
 but we don't really know.

1:09:56.980 --> 1:09:58.060
 But we look at it,

1:09:58.060 --> 1:10:00.340
 and our research have never seen an example of it.

1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:03.420
 But flashbacks can mean a number of other things.

1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:05.300
 I think the most common thing people experience

1:10:05.300 --> 1:10:08.580
 is what we call state-dependent learning.

1:10:08.580 --> 1:10:12.220
 It's returning yourself to a similar context

1:10:12.220 --> 1:10:13.940
 can bring back the same thoughts

1:10:13.940 --> 1:10:15.860
 and emotions as the experience.

1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:18.780
 So someone used mushrooms a week ago.

1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:22.380
 Now they do something like they smoke some cannabis,

1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:27.220
 or they take a warm bath,

1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:29.100
 or they're simply relaxed

1:10:29.100 --> 1:10:30.580
 and it seems to come out of the blue,

1:10:30.580 --> 1:10:31.940
 and all of a sudden these,

1:10:31.940 --> 1:10:33.980
 or they follow a thought trail

1:10:33.980 --> 1:10:35.780
 that reminds them of their,

1:10:35.780 --> 1:10:39.900
 and they find themselves in that same experience again.

1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:42.020
 I think that's more state-dependent learning.

1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:45.420
 It's not the distressing component that is in,

1:10:45.420 --> 1:10:47.420
 and it's typically not perceptual.

1:10:47.420 --> 1:10:49.540
 And then another class

1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:53.580
 are just sort of perceptual anomalies

1:10:53.580 --> 1:10:56.780
 within a day or two following the experience,

1:10:56.780 --> 1:10:58.540
 which is not HPPD.

1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:01.660
 Most people have joked that this is a free trip.

1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:04.980
 Like you might see a few trails or halos the day afterwards.

1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:07.620
 It doesn't last longer than that.

1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:09.340
 And it doesn't screw you up.

1:11:09.340 --> 1:11:10.180
 It's kind of fun.

1:11:10.180 --> 1:11:11.580
 Like, oh yeah, I'm still seeing some trails.

1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:13.420
 Most people will say.

1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.380
 So it could mean any of those things.

1:11:15.380 --> 1:11:17.020
 Flashback is, yeah.

1:11:17.020 --> 1:11:17.860
 Interesting.

1:11:17.860 --> 1:11:20.220
 No, I appreciate you clarifying that.

1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:23.660
 I mean, one very common misconception

1:11:23.660 --> 1:11:26.340
 about neuroplasticity is that it's an event

1:11:26.340 --> 1:11:28.860
 and it's not an event, it's a process.

1:11:28.860 --> 1:11:31.620
 And we have no understanding

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:33.780
 of the duration of that process.

1:11:33.780 --> 1:11:37.460
 However, the experience of any drug

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:39.420
 or any life experience, right,

1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:41.980
 even if it's a trauma or a wonderful experience

1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:44.340
 or a psychedelic experience, doesn't matter,

1:11:44.340 --> 1:11:47.980
 sets in motion a series of dominoes that fall.

1:11:47.980 --> 1:11:49.540
 And it's the falling of those dominoes

1:11:49.540 --> 1:11:51.020
 that we call neuroplasticity.

1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:54.140
 I mean, the reshaping of neural circuits could take years.

1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:55.100
 We don't know.

1:11:55.100 --> 1:11:58.100
 It's the trigger and then there's the actual change.

1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:00.500
 And so I think that some of what you described

1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:03.740
 could be literally the reordering of circuitry,

1:12:03.740 --> 1:12:06.540
 that in some individuals might extend longer than others.

1:12:07.860 --> 1:12:10.340
 And there is one phenomenon

1:12:10.340 --> 1:12:14.380
 that I've been told people experience.

1:12:14.380 --> 1:12:15.420
 And I'm wondering whether or not

1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.580
 any of the patients you've worked with

1:12:17.580 --> 1:12:20.540
 or people in your trials have reported this.

1:12:21.540 --> 1:12:23.100
 I've never done ayahuasca,

1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:25.900
 which I'm assuming has some overlap

1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:27.020
 with the serotonin system.

1:12:27.020 --> 1:12:28.060
 Probably hits a variety of systems.

1:12:28.060 --> 1:12:30.940
 So it's DMT, the active, yeah, it's orally active.

1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:31.780
 That's right.

1:12:31.780 --> 1:12:33.340
 MAO inhibitors that allow the DMT

1:12:33.340 --> 1:12:34.180
 to be orally.

1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:37.580
 Right, I should have recalled that, absolutely.

1:12:37.580 --> 1:12:38.420
 Well, I've never done it,

1:12:38.420 --> 1:12:41.700
 but a number of people I know that have done ayahuasca

1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:44.780
 as well as people I know who have done MDMA

1:12:44.780 --> 1:12:49.100
 report an increased sense of what are sometimes called ASMR,

1:12:49.100 --> 1:12:52.980
 or these autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, which is,

1:12:52.980 --> 1:12:53.820
 and it's interesting,

1:12:53.820 --> 1:12:57.900
 a lot of people have these naturally and they hide these.

1:12:57.900 --> 1:12:58.980
 It's actually something

1:12:58.980 --> 1:13:01.180
 that many people keep hidden to themselves.

1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:03.700
 I'll just ask you if you can do it.

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:06.620
 So some people are able to pass a,

1:13:06.620 --> 1:13:08.460
 like a shiver down their spine

1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:10.500
 or up their spine consciously.

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:11.900
 You know, like you can kind of,

1:13:11.900 --> 1:13:14.500
 like I'm able to actually pass a shiver up my spine.

1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:15.980
 I actually learned how to do this when I was a kid

1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:16.820
 on a hot day.

1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:18.260
 I was standing on a field in sports camp

1:13:18.260 --> 1:13:19.420
 and I was like, it's really hot here.

1:13:19.420 --> 1:13:21.660
 And I could actually create like a cooling,

1:13:22.540 --> 1:13:24.220
 cooled perception.

1:13:24.220 --> 1:13:26.140
 Some people, I told someone this once

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:28.340
 and then this led to a discussion of, oh, I can do it.

1:13:28.340 --> 1:13:29.500
 But I always hid that from people

1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:31.620
 because it's actually somewhat pleasurable.

1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:35.260
 And this is a well-known phenomenon, ASMR.

1:13:35.260 --> 1:13:38.980
 And some people I know who have taken MDMA therapeutically

1:13:38.980 --> 1:13:43.980
 or ayahuasca will report that they feel great relief

1:13:44.180 --> 1:13:45.020
 from this.

1:13:45.020 --> 1:13:47.180
 They can generate these autonomic reflexes

1:13:47.180 --> 1:13:49.220
 through their body more readily.

1:13:49.220 --> 1:13:50.700
 Probably, I'm guessing,

1:13:50.700 --> 1:13:53.900
 because they were able to tune into a kind of deeper sense

1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:55.260
 of somatic self.

1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:57.980
 Now on the internet, ASMR, if you look it up,

1:13:57.980 --> 1:13:59.420
 it's a little bit like the bath salt thing,

1:13:59.420 --> 1:14:00.460
 but in the other direction.

1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:02.180
 Like there were people that pay,

1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:04.980
 let's just say there are accounts on YouTube

1:14:04.980 --> 1:14:07.700
 that have many, many millions of viewers

1:14:07.700 --> 1:14:11.580
 of people that will whisper to them about,

1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:15.420
 like for instance, there's people that will go listen to,

1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:16.940
 it seems to be women in particular,

1:14:16.940 --> 1:14:19.900
 whispering about like car mechanics or something

1:14:19.900 --> 1:14:21.580
 or about, or scratching.

1:14:21.580 --> 1:14:23.500
 So there are certain sounds will do this,

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.820
 whispering, tapping, finger tapping,

1:14:25.820 --> 1:14:28.100
 and people experience immense pleasure from it.

1:14:28.100 --> 1:14:29.540
 It's not really sexual pleasure,

1:14:29.540 --> 1:14:32.420
 but it's this kind of deep core of the body.

1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:34.180
 It's the autonomic nervous system

1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:35.020
 down the corner of the spine.

1:14:35.020 --> 1:14:36.260
 Probably what a certain number of people

1:14:36.260 --> 1:14:37.780
 would call Kundalini,

1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:40.340
 which is another one scientifically who, yeah.

1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:41.180
 That's right.

1:14:41.180 --> 1:14:44.380
 People who do long duration Kundalini breathing sessions,

1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:46.700
 many of them will report later feeling

1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:50.980
 as if their perception of self is outside of their head,

1:14:50.980 --> 1:14:52.660
 that they're literally walking.

1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:54.420
 It's very uncomfortable for them

1:14:54.420 --> 1:14:56.060
 that they feel like they're walking around

1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:59.380
 with their sense of self extended beyond the body.

1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:02.380
 And this is a clinically described neurologic phenomenon.

1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:03.500
 Have any studies been done?

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:05.900
 I would imagine that person might actually like,

1:15:05.900 --> 1:15:07.420
 would they duck?

1:15:07.420 --> 1:15:08.260
 Oh, what?

1:15:08.260 --> 1:15:09.100
 Like that would be an interesting experiment.

1:15:09.100 --> 1:15:10.260
 That would be the kind of thing my lab

1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:11.100
 would want to get into.

1:15:11.100 --> 1:15:12.700
 Yeah, their body could clear,

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:15.460
 but their projection wouldn't.

1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:16.660
 Yeah, the sense of self.

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:18.380
 I mean, there's a well-known phenomenon.

1:15:18.380 --> 1:15:20.660
 It's very, in a few individuals,

1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:24.020
 very sad where people actually avidly seek out

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:25.220
 amputation of their limbs

1:15:25.220 --> 1:15:27.620
 because their limbs they feel don't belong to their body.

1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:28.460
 Oh yeah.

1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:31.020
 This is a very sad and fortunately very rare,

1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:32.620
 but also very sad condition.

1:15:32.620 --> 1:15:36.660
 Anyway, I think that the core of this conversation

1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:38.900
 that we're drilling into is this notion

1:15:38.900 --> 1:15:40.860
 of reordering the self.

1:15:40.860 --> 1:15:43.700
 And it's a relief to me to know that flashbacks

1:15:43.700 --> 1:15:47.860
 are not something that is kind of, forgive the term,

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:51.860
 baked in to the psychedelic experience.

1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:53.340
 And I suppose that's a good segue

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:56.420
 to ask about other sorts of drugs.

1:15:56.420 --> 1:15:57.300
 Having said baked in,

1:15:57.300 --> 1:16:00.620
 the temptation is to go to marijuana or cannabis,

1:16:00.620 --> 1:16:04.420
 but if we could, I'd like to just ask about

1:16:04.420 --> 1:16:06.900
 some of the more dopaminergic compounds,

1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:08.340
 in particular MDMA.

1:16:08.340 --> 1:16:09.260
 Yeah.

1:16:09.260 --> 1:16:11.540
 My understanding is that MDMA

1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:14.180
 is a purely synthetic compound,

1:16:14.180 --> 1:16:16.860
 that you're not going to find MDMA in nature.

1:16:16.860 --> 1:16:17.980
 So far.

1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:18.820
 So far.

1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:20.780
 DMT was first synthesized in the lab

1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:23.100
 and then we thought it didn't exist in nature

1:16:23.100 --> 1:16:25.420
 and then like Richard Schultes

1:16:25.420 --> 1:16:28.660
 found it like everywhere in South America.

1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:29.500
 Who knows?

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:31.060
 A plan out there might be making MDMA,

1:16:31.060 --> 1:16:33.020
 but as far as we know now, no.

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:33.860
 Right.

1:16:33.860 --> 1:16:35.700
 And we'll talk about DMT and its sources within the body,

1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:40.700
 but MDMA could exist elsewhere,

1:16:40.940 --> 1:16:42.140
 but has been synthesized.

1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:44.740
 And my understanding is that MDMA

1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:47.380
 leads to very robust increases

1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:50.620
 in both dopamine and serotonin simultaneously,

1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:55.100
 which from a neural network's perspective

1:16:55.100 --> 1:16:57.660
 is a very unusual situation, right?

1:16:57.660 --> 1:17:00.820
 Normally, because dopamine puts us in this exteroceptive,

1:17:00.820 --> 1:17:01.900
 looking outside ourselves,

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:05.980
 seeking things in the world beyond the skin, our own skin,

1:17:05.980 --> 1:17:09.700
 and dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends to focus us inward.

1:17:09.700 --> 1:17:11.620
 Those are almost mutually exclusive

1:17:11.620 --> 1:17:13.540
 kind of neurochemical states,

1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:15.140
 although they're always at different levels.

1:17:15.140 --> 1:17:20.140
 So why would it be that having this increased dopamine

1:17:20.780 --> 1:17:25.060
 and increased serotonin would provide an experience

1:17:25.060 --> 1:17:26.540
 that is beneficial?

1:17:26.540 --> 1:17:29.580
 And how do you, to the extent that you can describe it,

1:17:29.580 --> 1:17:31.580
 how do you think that experience differs

1:17:31.580 --> 1:17:34.100
 from the sorts of experiences that people have on psilocybin

1:17:34.100 --> 1:17:36.580
 or more serotonergic agents?

1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:37.940
 Just broadly speaking.

1:17:37.940 --> 1:17:39.340
 Yeah, yeah.

1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:41.260
 In terms of that balance,

1:17:41.260 --> 1:17:45.060
 in terms of the effects generally on serotonin and dopamine,

1:17:46.260 --> 1:17:49.060
 I can only speculate,

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:53.740
 like sort of is that dopaminergic component necessary

1:17:53.740 --> 1:17:56.740
 for, let's say we know that the amygdala

1:17:56.740 --> 1:17:59.580
 is less reactive under acute effects,

1:17:59.580 --> 1:18:02.340
 and that may play a role in,

1:18:03.460 --> 1:18:07.140
 there's less sort of control from the amygdala

1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:10.100
 in terms of like one's experience of memory.

1:18:10.100 --> 1:18:13.100
 So it may be part of this sort of reprocessing,

1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:15.740
 this reconsolidation of these memories in a different way

1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:17.900
 where the amygdala is not like going crazy,

1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:20.380
 saying freak out, like fight or flight.

1:18:20.380 --> 1:18:21.580
 Well, I should have said,

1:18:21.580 --> 1:18:25.180
 it seems like MDMA is being used clinically anyway,

1:18:25.180 --> 1:18:29.140
 mainly for trauma, not just for depression.

1:18:30.860 --> 1:18:33.740
 Although part of that, we really don't know,

1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:36.380
 and maybe that MDMA is great for depression

1:18:36.380 --> 1:18:38.060
 and some of these other, and it may be that,

1:18:38.060 --> 1:18:39.300
 and I'm going to be looking at this soon,

1:18:39.300 --> 1:18:42.100
 that psilocybin is great for treating PTSD.

1:18:42.100 --> 1:18:44.780
 A lot of underground therapists say that,

1:18:44.780 --> 1:18:46.260
 underground psychedelic therapists.

1:18:46.260 --> 1:18:51.100
 So we don't really know yet which people doing illegal,

1:18:51.100 --> 1:18:54.420
 but more like a professional therapist would,

1:18:54.420 --> 1:18:55.500
 it's just illegal.

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:59.340
 And this is a kind of a growing thing.

1:18:59.340 --> 1:19:00.900
 So we don't really know which,

1:19:02.100 --> 1:19:06.620
 it's speculating, but it may be that MDMA

1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:11.620
 for a broader number of people is better for trauma

1:19:11.980 --> 1:19:14.300
 because the chances of having

1:19:14.300 --> 1:19:16.140
 an extremely challenging experience,

1:19:16.140 --> 1:19:20.860
 what I call the bad trip, like really freaking out,

1:19:20.860 --> 1:19:22.500
 is much lower with MDMA.

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:23.740
 People can have bad trips,

1:19:23.740 --> 1:19:25.420
 but they're of a different nature.

1:19:25.420 --> 1:19:28.500
 It's not sort of like freaking out

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:31.100
 because all of reality is sort of shattering

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:33.340
 and it's less of this,

1:19:33.340 --> 1:19:36.340
 it can take so many forms with the classic psychedelics,

1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:40.220
 but typically you'll hear something like,

1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:42.740
 I didn't know it was going to be like this,

1:19:42.740 --> 1:19:44.940
 no matter how hard you tried to prepare them,

1:19:44.940 --> 1:19:49.060
 that like, this is like, get me off this drive.

1:19:49.060 --> 1:19:50.380
 You're talking about LSD or psilocybin.

1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:53.500
 LSD, psilocybin, IY, yeah, yeah.

1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:56.660
 And just the sense of like, I'm going insane.

1:19:56.660 --> 1:20:00.420
 This is so far beyond anything I've ever experienced

1:20:00.420 --> 1:20:02.420
 and it's scaring the shit out of me.

1:20:03.300 --> 1:20:04.140
 How often does that happen?

1:20:04.140 --> 1:20:05.940
 I don't have a toe hold on anything,

1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:09.340
 even that I exist as an entity.

1:20:09.340 --> 1:20:12.460
 And that can be really, I think, frankly, experientially,

1:20:12.460 --> 1:20:13.620
 that's kind of the gateway

1:20:13.620 --> 1:20:17.780
 to both the transcendental mystical experiences,

1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:21.140
 the sense of unity with all things,

1:20:21.140 --> 1:20:22.700
 which we know our data suggests

1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:27.140
 is related to long-term positive outcomes.

1:20:27.140 --> 1:20:28.340
 Wait, I want to make sure I understand.

1:20:28.340 --> 1:20:29.540
 So you're saying the bad trip

1:20:29.540 --> 1:20:31.740
 can be related to the transcendental experience?

1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:34.100
 Right, I think those are both speculating,

1:20:34.100 --> 1:20:37.940
 but you have to pass through this sort of like,

1:20:39.020 --> 1:20:42.380
 reality shattering, including your sense of self.

1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:45.380
 And one can handle that in one of two ways.

1:20:45.380 --> 1:20:48.180
 You can either completely surrender to it

1:20:48.180 --> 1:20:49.940
 or you can try to hang on.

1:20:49.940 --> 1:20:50.940
 And if you try to hang on,

1:20:50.940 --> 1:20:52.660
 it's going to be more like a bad trip.

1:20:52.660 --> 1:20:54.220
 So again, I wish there was more

1:20:54.220 --> 1:20:56.220
 and hopefully there will be more experimentation.

1:20:56.220 --> 1:20:58.420
 There's a lot going on here in the black box

1:20:58.420 --> 1:21:00.620
 in terms of the operant behavior

1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:04.300
 of how you are within yourself,

1:21:04.300 --> 1:21:07.260
 choosing to handle, like letting go.

1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:09.780
 And eventually we'll be able to see this in real time

1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:10.740
 with brain imaging.

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:13.660
 Ah, there they are surrendering to the psychedelic experience.

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:17.340
 Here they are trying to hold on, but we're not there yet.

1:21:17.340 --> 1:21:19.820
 But I think through clinical observation,

1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:23.300
 it seems pretty clear that something like that is going on.

1:21:23.300 --> 1:21:26.620
 And certain drugs like DMT, smoke DMT, can be so strong.

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:30.580
 The reason I think that can be so extraordinary,

1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:31.420
 you can compare to the others,

1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:32.940
 because it like forces people.

1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:34.220
 Like there is no choice to hang out in it.

1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:35.060
 I've never done it.

1:21:35.060 --> 1:21:39.020
 I was told that DMT is like a high-speed locomotive

1:21:39.020 --> 1:21:40.740
 into the psychedelic experience

1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:43.180
 and out of the psychedelic experience.

1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:46.500
 And there's no ability to hold on to the self

1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:48.820
 while you're in the kind of peak phase.

1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:49.660
 Is that correct?

1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:50.740
 A lot of people say that,

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.940
 but Terrence McKenna,

1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:55.980
 who is kind of the classic bard on DMT effects,

1:21:55.980 --> 1:21:59.620
 he would say the sense of self was intact,

1:21:59.620 --> 1:22:03.460
 but everything else, the sensorium and what you navigated,

1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:05.580
 what you oriented towards,

1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:07.580
 everything else changed basically.

1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:09.260
 But it's hard to, when everything's changing,

1:22:09.260 --> 1:22:11.620
 it's hard to say like, what is the self that's changing?

1:22:11.620 --> 1:22:12.980
 What is the rest of the world?

1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:15.180
 Well, and language is totally deficient

1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:19.740
 to describe experience anyway, much less on a psychedelic.

1:22:19.740 --> 1:22:21.500
 What is McKenna's background?

1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:24.580
 Like what is his qualification for being this,

1:22:24.580 --> 1:22:27.380
 as you referred, this bard of DMT?

1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:28.780
 And we're talking about Terrence

1:22:28.780 --> 1:22:31.260
 and there's also the brother Dennis,

1:22:31.260 --> 1:22:33.300
 whom I know who's-

1:22:33.300 --> 1:22:35.460
 Can only imagine what Thanksgiving dinner is like

1:22:35.460 --> 1:22:37.420
 at their house. Terrence passed away

1:22:37.420 --> 1:22:39.420
 years, a couple of decades ago now,

1:22:39.420 --> 1:22:42.420
 but he's sort of the one who's known as being a bard

1:22:42.420 --> 1:22:46.580
 and you can find hundreds, if not thousands of hours of him

1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:48.860
 on the lecture circuit in the eighties and nineties

1:22:48.860 --> 1:22:49.860
 on YouTube.

1:22:49.860 --> 1:22:52.500
 But his background was really, oh gosh,

1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:54.500
 I don't recall what his college degree was in,

1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:57.620
 but he basically, when he was like 19,

1:22:57.620 --> 1:22:59.820
 he traveled to South America

1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:03.100
 and actually on the initial trip with his brother

1:23:03.100 --> 1:23:06.300
 who was even younger than him, with some other friends

1:23:06.300 --> 1:23:11.140
 and just in search for a DMT snuff

1:23:11.140 --> 1:23:14.020
 that they had read about in the Harvard archives

1:23:14.020 --> 1:23:17.980
 from the work of Schultes from a generation before,

1:23:17.980 --> 1:23:22.660
 but they had discovered all of these mushrooms growing

1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:24.980
 that down there, the psilocybin mushrooms,

1:23:24.980 --> 1:23:28.540
 what they recognized and just took a lot of mushrooms and-

1:23:29.780 --> 1:23:30.660
 And talked about it.

1:23:30.660 --> 1:23:31.500
 Talked about it.

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.500
 And Terrence was basically a very intelligent,

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:38.300
 very well-read and literature and culture person

1:23:38.300 --> 1:23:41.700
 that could be, he was sort of the next generation's

1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:44.860
 Tim Leary, someone who could really speak,

1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:47.420
 get a little closer to the magnitude

1:23:47.420 --> 1:23:50.300
 of what the psychedelic experience was like for people.

1:23:50.300 --> 1:23:53.740
 And he served, like Leary, somewhat of an advocate.

1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:56.300
 I mean, he would tell people, folks,

1:23:56.300 --> 1:23:59.420
 you could see the equivalent of a UFO landing

1:23:59.420 --> 1:24:00.860
 on the White House lawn.

1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:02.620
 Like it's right there.

1:24:02.620 --> 1:24:03.900
 It'll take five minutes.

1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:06.900
 It'll shake everything in your reality.

1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:08.980
 He would sort of goad people into doing it.

1:24:08.980 --> 1:24:11.580
 Well, certainly science and clinical medicine

1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:15.180
 are just but two lenses with which to explore

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.300
 these things in life.

1:24:16.300 --> 1:24:21.300
 But part of the reason I ask is I feel like, you know,

1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:24.180
 in the world of health and fitness,

1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:28.220
 you have this very extreme condition

1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:30.980
 of like Arnold Schwarzenegger's and bodybuilders

1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:33.500
 who have like 2% body fat and they look like,

1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:36.180
 to most people, they look kind of freakish,

1:24:36.180 --> 1:24:37.180
 especially now, right?

1:24:37.180 --> 1:24:38.140
 Oh, especially now.

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:38.980
 Especially now.

1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:39.820
 Yeah.

1:24:39.820 --> 1:24:40.640
 And yeah.

1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.260
 Made Arnold look like regular.

1:24:42.260 --> 1:24:43.100
 Exactly.

1:24:43.100 --> 1:24:43.940
 Back in his day, yeah.

1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:46.700
 And you have contortionists who can put themselves

1:24:46.700 --> 1:24:49.380
 into a small box and wrap themselves into a pretzel.

1:24:49.380 --> 1:24:53.580
 But from those two very extreme subculture practices

1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:57.780
 that, I don't know anything about contortionism really,

1:24:57.780 --> 1:25:00.740
 but except that they get really bendy,

1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:04.540
 but it was a community that included lifestyle practices

1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:06.800
 and nutritional practices and then drug practices.

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:09.260
 From those very extreme subcultures,

1:25:09.260 --> 1:25:12.660
 there's been an export, which is that, you know,

1:25:12.660 --> 1:25:14.240
 weight training is healthy, right?

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:15.620
 The general public has done that.

1:25:15.620 --> 1:25:17.180
 Or that yoga is healthy.

1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:20.220
 So contortionism to yoga, et cetera.

1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:22.340
 And I feel like a similar thing is happening

1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:26.220
 in the realm of psychedelics where it was Leary

1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:29.100
 and Huxley.

1:25:29.100 --> 1:25:30.980
 I mean, like I'm from the Bay Area.

1:25:30.980 --> 1:25:32.700
 I'm not far from the Menlo Park VA

1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:35.340
 where One Flew Over the Cuckoos is basically based on, right?

1:25:35.340 --> 1:25:36.420
 Ken Kesey and those guys.

1:25:36.420 --> 1:25:39.820
 And you know, there has been an attempt

1:25:39.820 --> 1:25:44.820
 at creating this movement toward openness about psychedelics

1:25:45.100 --> 1:25:46.740
 and their positive effects.

1:25:46.740 --> 1:25:48.460
 This has happened before.

1:25:48.460 --> 1:25:50.420
 The difference is that now there are people like you

1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:52.220
 inside the walls of the university

1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:54.980
 or publishing peer reviewed studies and things of that sort.

1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:56.900
 The reason I asked about McKenna was, you know,

1:25:56.900 --> 1:26:00.780
 it seems like McKenna and his brother are,

1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:05.100
 but you know, just two of many people,

1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:06.300
 Michael Pollan, et cetera,

1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:11.260
 who have no real formal training in biology or psychology.

1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:15.660
 The other guys who were at universities lost their jobs.

1:26:15.660 --> 1:26:18.060
 They were actually removed from places like Harvard

1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:20.340
 and other universities for their kind

1:26:20.340 --> 1:26:22.980
 of cavalier explorations, right?

1:26:22.980 --> 1:26:25.020
 And now things are kind of returning.

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:27.620
 So in the same way that bodybuilding led to weight training

1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:31.140
 in every corner gym, you know, men, women, and children,

1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:34.400
 and contortionism is one extreme,

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:36.600
 but people generally think that yoga is a pretty

1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:38.180
 healthy practice, right?

1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:40.160
 These are matter of degrees, right?

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:44.660
 And now here you are inside the walls

1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:47.900
 of a very highly respected university, Johns Hopkins.

1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:49.780
 You're on the medical school side of the undergrad.

1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:54.180
 So in the med school, which is, you know,

1:26:54.180 --> 1:26:57.460
 a serious health institution.

1:27:00.100 --> 1:27:03.820
 You know, the question is to me, you know,

1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:07.140
 what are the valuable exports, right?

1:27:07.140 --> 1:27:09.100
 And where does the extreme lie?

1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:11.820
 I mean, clearly there's a problem

1:27:11.820 --> 1:27:16.820
 with tinkering with reality through pharmacology.

1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:19.180
 And there's a benefit, it sounds like,

1:27:19.180 --> 1:27:23.060
 to tinkering with reality through pharmacology.

1:27:23.060 --> 1:27:25.660
 And what's so striking to me is this,

1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:29.340
 is the elements of atypical experience,

1:27:29.340 --> 1:27:31.540
 atypical representation of the self.

1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:36.540
 So for the average person, right?

1:27:37.300 --> 1:27:38.900
 Or for kids that are hearing this,

1:27:38.900 --> 1:27:40.660
 kids that are in their teens, right?

1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:42.660
 What are the, I want to talk about,

1:27:42.660 --> 1:27:44.860
 what are the dangers of psychedelics?

1:27:44.860 --> 1:27:46.580
 This is something you don't hear a lot about these days,

1:27:46.580 --> 1:27:48.940
 and it's not because I'm anti-psychedelic at all,

1:27:48.940 --> 1:27:50.500
 but what are the dangers, right?

1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:54.540
 If a kid or adult has a predisposition toward,

1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:59.540
 let's say psychotic thinking, right?

1:27:59.540 --> 1:28:02.380
 Or auditory hallucinations,

1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:07.380
 or is on the Asperger's side of the autism spectrum,

1:28:07.820 --> 1:28:10.500
 is there an increased risk of bringing the mind

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.620
 into these states?

1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:14.820
 Because it sounds like a very labile situation.

1:28:14.820 --> 1:28:16.700
 So could we talk a little bit about that?

1:28:16.700 --> 1:28:18.900
 And are there classes of these different drugs,

1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:21.260
 whether or not it be MDMA, LSD, or DMT,

1:28:21.260 --> 1:28:24.780
 that you think are particularly sharp blades

1:28:24.780 --> 1:28:28.500
 and therefore need to be wielded particularly carefully?

1:28:28.500 --> 1:28:33.500
 Yeah, so these can be profoundly destabilizing experiences

1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:40.300
 and ones that ideally are had in a safe container,

1:28:43.340 --> 1:28:47.860
 sort of where someone, what are the relevant dangers

1:28:47.860 --> 1:28:49.700
 and what can we do to mitigate those?

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:52.860
 So there's two biggies.

1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:55.860
 One, and I've already mentioned,

1:28:55.860 --> 1:29:00.220
 it's people with very severe psychiatric illness,

1:29:00.220 --> 1:29:02.940
 not depression, not anxiety.

1:29:02.940 --> 1:29:06.660
 I'm talking about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:10.180
 or mania as part of bipolar disorder.

1:29:10.180 --> 1:29:13.100
 So, and diagnostically, this has shifted.

1:29:13.100 --> 1:29:15.140
 So it's a little hard to say how many people today

1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:17.100
 with bipolar would have been labeled as schizophrenia

1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:20.900
 back in the 60s when some of this early research

1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:23.220
 or just clinical observation was done.

1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:27.380
 So it seems very clear that folks with a predisposition

1:29:27.380 --> 1:29:29.580
 or active disease, they could be destabilized.

1:29:29.580 --> 1:29:31.660
 And so some of the cases that we know of,

1:29:31.660 --> 1:29:33.460
 I always think of Sid Barrett,

1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:38.460
 the first singer of Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear,

1:29:38.900 --> 1:29:39.740
 although I think the family-

1:29:39.740 --> 1:29:41.220
 I don't know what happened there.

1:29:41.220 --> 1:29:43.140
 I should be, sorry, Pink Floyd fans.

1:29:43.140 --> 1:29:45.300
 I've never, the songs are just really long.

1:29:45.300 --> 1:29:46.940
 Yeah, you're more of a punk guy, right?

1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:47.780
 Yeah.

1:29:48.780 --> 1:29:50.980
 So I've got my foot in a lot of worlds,

1:29:50.980 --> 1:29:53.420
 definitely in part in the Floyd world,

1:29:53.420 --> 1:29:57.820
 but he basically went crazy early on.

1:29:57.820 --> 1:30:00.700
 He, it seemed, I don't think his family ever admitted it,

1:30:00.700 --> 1:30:04.500
 but he developed schizophrenia, classic pattern.

1:30:04.500 --> 1:30:07.500
 And he was doing a lot of LSD.

1:30:08.580 --> 1:30:11.540
 But like a lot of these cases,

1:30:11.540 --> 1:30:14.300
 it looked like he was showing all of the signs

1:30:14.300 --> 1:30:19.300
 of some hints that he had that susceptibility before.

1:30:23.540 --> 1:30:26.420
 And often this is hard to disentangle what causes what,

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:30.500
 because when do people typically, not always, but develop,

1:30:30.500 --> 1:30:32.380
 when's the modal period for first break?

1:30:32.380 --> 1:30:34.580
 It's adolescence, early adulthood, yeah.

1:30:34.580 --> 1:30:37.260
 And when do people start playing with drugs?

1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:39.780
 Same exact time period.

1:30:39.780 --> 1:30:43.300
 So it can be hard to disentangle, but it seems pretty clear.

1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:45.980
 Now I should also say, there are cases of folks

1:30:45.980 --> 1:30:48.700
 with schizophrenia that say psychedelics have helped them.

1:30:48.700 --> 1:30:50.300
 There's anecdotes for everything.

1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:52.060
 Do the people around those schizophrenics

1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:52.900
 say it's helped them?

1:30:52.900 --> 1:30:53.740
 I don't know.

1:30:53.740 --> 1:30:55.820
 Because when schizophrenics say things, you have to,

1:30:55.820 --> 1:30:58.780
 I mean, with all due compassion and respect

1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:01.740
 for schizophrenia, it's a disorder of thinking.

1:31:01.740 --> 1:31:03.700
 So if they're saying it helped them.

1:31:03.700 --> 1:31:04.860
 Yeah, can you trust them?

1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:05.700
 Yeah.

1:31:05.700 --> 1:31:08.740
 I wouldn't be surprised if there was some kernel of truth

1:31:08.740 --> 1:31:11.140
 in some cases, but they're just so,

1:31:11.140 --> 1:31:14.860
 it seems very clear that the other side is there too.

1:31:14.860 --> 1:31:17.900
 And that there ever is a therapeutic potential there

1:31:17.900 --> 1:31:19.020
 for those disorders,

1:31:19.020 --> 1:31:21.460
 that shouldn't be the first thing on our list.

1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:24.460
 We need to learn a lot more because of the level of risk

1:31:24.460 --> 1:31:27.380
 before we start doing research to see if,

1:31:27.380 --> 1:31:29.860
 you know, psilocybin can help with schizophrenia.

1:31:29.860 --> 1:31:32.060
 Like, I don't think that that may never be the case,

1:31:32.060 --> 1:31:35.180
 but even if it is, you'd have to be even more cautious

1:31:35.180 --> 1:31:37.860
 and figure some more things out first

1:31:37.860 --> 1:31:39.540
 with some of these other disorders.

1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:41.900
 What about bipolar disorder?

1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:44.180
 Can it be exacerbated by these compounds?

1:31:44.180 --> 1:31:49.180
 Yeah, and it may be that sort of the manifestation

1:31:50.260 --> 1:31:53.100
 of people having prolonged psychiatric issues

1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:58.100
 after a psychedelic experience, as atypical as that is,

1:31:58.820 --> 1:32:02.100
 when that happens, it may be that might be more

1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:05.060
 like a manic episode than a psychotic episode,

1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:06.860
 and that can be a blurry line.

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:10.900
 And it's, the folklore is that, you know,

1:32:10.900 --> 1:32:12.900
 people go on a trip and they never come back.

1:32:12.900 --> 1:32:15.340
 That's clearly not the case because, you know,

1:32:15.340 --> 1:32:17.660
 the drug is metabolized like for anyone else,

1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:19.100
 and the next day there's not, you know,

1:32:19.100 --> 1:32:19.940
 it's virtually nothing in the system.

1:32:19.940 --> 1:32:21.820
 But it reshapes circuitry, I mean.

1:32:21.820 --> 1:32:24.180
 Right, and there's still, and I really do think, you know,

1:32:24.180 --> 1:32:28.660
 much like the positive, you know, long-term effects that,

1:32:28.660 --> 1:32:33.220
 you know, this class of problems is related to like the,

1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:38.100
 to the experience and the destabilization

1:32:38.100 --> 1:32:42.020
 that can happen from that experience,

1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:44.700
 if it's not in the right container.

1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:47.900
 And again, like these people are susceptible to, you know,

1:32:47.900 --> 1:32:50.780
 some people with that psychotic predisposition,

1:32:50.780 --> 1:32:55.100
 they lucky to be born to a great family, stable environment.

1:32:55.100 --> 1:32:57.660
 They maybe never have a full break or the one that they have

1:32:57.660 --> 1:33:00.220
 is not nearly as bad as what, you know,

1:33:00.220 --> 1:33:04.060
 someone who's homeless and is coming from all kinds

1:33:04.060 --> 1:33:05.340
 of early childhood trauma.

1:33:05.340 --> 1:33:08.860
 Like the disease is probably going to be far worse, you know.

1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:12.660
 So, you know, having a psychedelic experience

1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:16.100
 is like one of those destabilizing experiences, you know.

1:33:16.100 --> 1:33:19.020
 So, now fortunately it's really easy

1:33:19.020 --> 1:33:20.500
 to identify those people.

1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:23.500
 And we even err on the side of extreme caution

1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:25.220
 by eliminating people with like, say,

1:33:25.220 --> 1:33:26.260
 a first degree relative.

1:33:26.260 --> 1:33:28.620
 In some studies, even a second degree relative.

1:33:28.620 --> 1:33:31.380
 Given the heritability, there's some increased chance

1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:33.020
 if your brother or your...

1:33:33.020 --> 1:33:33.860
 Yeah.

1:33:34.780 --> 1:33:38.580
 So, in an abundance of caution, even eliminating that.

1:33:38.580 --> 1:33:40.880
 I think eventually if it's approved for use,

1:33:41.780 --> 1:33:45.420
 FDA use, that we could dial back on that as we learn more.

1:33:45.420 --> 1:33:49.180
 I think it's, again, overly cautious, which is-

1:33:49.180 --> 1:33:50.660
 But you're doing an early stage clinical trial.

1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:52.300
 Yeah, it's the appropriate place

1:33:52.300 --> 1:33:53.620
 to start at this point in time.

1:33:53.620 --> 1:33:56.260
 But, you know, if you give a skid

1:33:56.260 --> 1:33:58.260
 or another structured psychiatric interview

1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:00.060
 with a clinician sitting down with this person

1:34:00.060 --> 1:34:02.380
 for a few hours to delve into their history.

1:34:02.380 --> 1:34:05.140
 And like, you can very reliably determine

1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:07.660
 if this person has either, you know,

1:34:07.660 --> 1:34:10.100
 a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder

1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:12.140
 or a strong predisposition.

1:34:12.140 --> 1:34:14.420
 So, that's, you know, that you can screen for that.

1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:15.860
 And that's how you address that.

1:34:15.860 --> 1:34:18.820
 The far more likely danger is the bad trip.

1:34:18.820 --> 1:34:20.180
 Anyone can have this.

1:34:20.180 --> 1:34:21.940
 The most psychologically healthy person

1:34:21.940 --> 1:34:23.700
 in the world, probably.

1:34:23.700 --> 1:34:25.060
 You jack the dose high enough,

1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:29.180
 and especially in a less than an ideal environment,

1:34:29.180 --> 1:34:30.580
 you can have a bad trip.

1:34:30.580 --> 1:34:33.620
 You even get it in an ideal environment like ours,

1:34:33.620 --> 1:34:37.260
 at a high dose of around 30 milligrams of psilocybin.

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:39.980
 After, you know, the best preparation we can provide,

1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:42.060
 about a third of people will say,

1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:45.140
 essentially, at some point they have a bad trip, you know.

1:34:45.140 --> 1:34:47.340
 At some point within the entire journey.

1:34:47.340 --> 1:34:48.860
 Right, now they could have

1:34:48.860 --> 1:34:50.980
 one of the most beautiful experiences of their life,

1:34:50.980 --> 1:34:53.460
 sometimes, like a couple minutes later.

1:34:53.460 --> 1:34:56.180
 But at some point, they had a sense of strong anxiety,

1:34:56.180 --> 1:34:59.620
 fear, losing their mind, feeling trapped,

1:34:59.620 --> 1:35:01.380
 something like that.

1:35:01.380 --> 1:35:04.540
 Now, typically when people have that in the, you know,

1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:06.660
 when they're just taking on their own,

1:35:06.660 --> 1:35:08.180
 like a lot of things, they're fine.

1:35:08.180 --> 1:35:09.020
 They get through it.

1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:11.100
 You know, they're more likely to be better off

1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:14.260
 if they're not having to navigate the streets of Manhattan.

1:35:14.260 --> 1:35:17.340
 That, you know, or, and if they're with, you know,

1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:19.500
 other people with friends,

1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:21.580
 better that those friends aren't also dealing

1:35:21.580 --> 1:35:22.980
 with their own psychedelic experience,

1:35:22.980 --> 1:35:25.340
 but probably having some friend of any type,

1:35:25.340 --> 1:35:27.260
 but whether they're on there is better than having nothing.

1:35:27.260 --> 1:35:30.260
 So very dependent on context.

1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:32.740
 And so the tough thing here that,

1:35:32.740 --> 1:35:35.700
 that in conveying to the public is that

1:35:36.820 --> 1:35:38.380
 a lot of folks will say,

1:35:38.380 --> 1:35:41.060
 man, I've taken psychedelics hundreds of times,

1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:43.780
 and this is like your fear-mongering,

1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:46.500
 and, you know, there's no, you know,

1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:48.300
 you're exaggerating the danger there.

1:35:48.300 --> 1:35:50.820
 So I want to say it is atypical,

1:35:50.820 --> 1:35:53.500
 but sometimes, and I have a file folder

1:35:53.500 --> 1:35:57.700
 that grows larger every year of these cases,

1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:00.020
 either in the medical literature or from the news

1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:02.180
 of people that freak out on a psychedelic

1:36:02.180 --> 1:36:04.740
 and they get hurt or they die.

1:36:04.740 --> 1:36:06.500
 They run into traffic.

1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:08.580
 They fall from a height,

1:36:08.580 --> 1:36:10.060
 whether they thought they could fly

1:36:10.060 --> 1:36:12.220
 or whether they just fell like they,

1:36:12.220 --> 1:36:13.580
 you can do when you're drunk

1:36:13.580 --> 1:36:16.140
 or you're intoxicated on any substance.

1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:18.700
 Sometimes that's unclear.

1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:22.780
 Or gosh, one of the craziest cases was a kid,

1:36:22.780 --> 1:36:26.460
 like an 18 year old or so in Oregon several years back

1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:28.420
 that just, he even wrote about,

1:36:28.420 --> 1:36:30.300
 I want to take the biggest, he had done mushrooms before.

1:36:30.300 --> 1:36:32.380
 I want to take a heroic dose,

1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:33.580
 the biggest dose I've ever taken.

1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:35.620
 He ended up just totally out of it,

1:36:35.620 --> 1:36:37.020
 ended up in a neighbor's house.

1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:38.540
 He was just totally disoriented,

1:36:38.540 --> 1:36:39.540
 disconnected from reality,

1:36:39.540 --> 1:36:41.620
 and the cops ended up killing him.

1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:42.700
 And it was just tragic,

1:36:42.700 --> 1:36:45.300
 obviously an overuse of force in that case,

1:36:45.300 --> 1:36:46.780
 because he was actually naked at the time,

1:36:46.780 --> 1:36:49.980
 this naked like 120 pound, I think,

1:36:49.980 --> 1:36:52.340
 as a recalled kid that ended up dying.

1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:55.060
 Well, it's analogous to the reason I use the examples

1:36:55.060 --> 1:36:56.260
 of like bodybuilding culture.

1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:58.620
 I mean, people there have taken excessive amounts

1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:00.980
 of antibiotics and diuretics and died.

1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:02.460
 Then the contortionist culture,

1:37:02.460 --> 1:37:04.820
 people have put themselves in a little plexiglass boxes

1:37:04.820 --> 1:37:09.660
 to do, at the extremes, you're going to get deaths.

1:37:09.660 --> 1:37:11.140
 And at the extremes,

1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:14.220
 and one of the extremes is the sheer number of people

1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:18.500
 with different biological makeups taking the same drug.

1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:20.340
 And so you can create extremes through numbers.

1:37:20.340 --> 1:37:21.380
 You can take extreme,

1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:23.980
 you create extremes through dosage, right?

1:37:23.980 --> 1:37:25.620
 It seems.

1:37:25.620 --> 1:37:28.060
 Well, this is why I'm such a fan of the fact

1:37:28.060 --> 1:37:30.500
 that people like yourself are doing clinical trials

1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:33.820
 inside the walls of universities.

1:37:33.820 --> 1:37:38.820
 Not because I think that psychedelics only have utility

1:37:39.260 --> 1:37:40.220
 in those environments,

1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:42.780
 but because it's so important toward creating

1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:45.660
 their transition to legality

1:37:45.660 --> 1:37:48.100
 and to understand what legality means

1:37:48.100 --> 1:37:50.020
 for a compound like this, right?

1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:51.020
 What model?

1:37:51.020 --> 1:37:52.300
 Right, I mean, again,

1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:54.180
 we'll stay with the anabolic steroids.

1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:56.780
 There's now testosterone and estrogen replacement therapy.

1:37:56.780 --> 1:37:59.460
 Hormone replacement therapy is a common

1:37:59.460 --> 1:38:00.700
 medically approved practice,

1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:01.740
 but that's vastly different

1:38:01.740 --> 1:38:04.380
 than people taking their own stuff or diet

1:38:04.380 --> 1:38:06.820
 or deciding how much they need to take, right?

1:38:06.820 --> 1:38:09.500
 Like we said, there's yoga and there's contortionism

1:38:09.500 --> 1:38:12.940
 in a plexiglass box and thinking of Houdini or something.

1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:15.900
 So these are a matter of degrees.

1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:16.940
 Speaking of dosage,

1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:20.300
 I definitely want to ask you about microdose

1:38:20.300 --> 1:38:22.860
 versus standard or macrodose.

1:38:24.420 --> 1:38:26.500
 Tell me that I'm wrong,

1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:29.020
 but I'm always a little bit,

1:38:30.500 --> 1:38:32.180
 I sort of, a little,

1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:34.900
 I'm micro cynical, if you will,

1:38:34.900 --> 1:38:36.580
 about this term microdose.

1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:39.580
 And the reason is that many people that I know

1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:41.300
 who talk about microdosing

1:38:42.860 --> 1:38:46.180
 are taking dosages of compounds that work at,

1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:50.300
 that are very powerful at microgram levels.

1:38:50.300 --> 1:38:51.620
 So the word micro,

1:38:51.620 --> 1:38:53.500
 I think can be a little bit confusing to people

1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:57.860
 because microdose implies less than something.

1:38:57.860 --> 1:38:59.620
 It's a mini dose, right?

1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:02.060
 And yet some of these compounds

1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:06.620
 are tremendously powerful at microgram concentrations.

1:39:06.620 --> 1:39:10.300
 So what it constitutes a microdose

1:39:10.300 --> 1:39:14.220
 and what is the value of so-called microdosing, if any,

1:39:14.220 --> 1:39:17.980
 and how does it differ from standard

1:39:17.980 --> 1:39:20.620
 or what I can only assume is called macrodosing?

1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:21.460
 Yeah.

1:39:21.460 --> 1:39:24.460
 And so LSD would be the prototypical example

1:39:24.460 --> 1:39:27.180
 of that super potent compound.

1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:31.940
 What size dosage of LSD will lead to hallucinations

1:39:31.940 --> 1:39:32.780
 and kind of standard?

1:39:32.780 --> 1:39:37.100
 So sort of the entry point for psychedelic type effects,

1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:38.740
 which may not involve hallucination.

1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:40.780
 Actually, most classic psychedelics

1:39:40.780 --> 1:39:42.740
 don't lead to true hallucinations

1:39:42.740 --> 1:39:44.300
 as defined in psychiatry.

1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:46.660
 You know, thinking you're talking to the person

1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:48.180
 that's not there, seeing the pink elephant.

1:39:48.180 --> 1:39:50.740
 No, it's more like tracers and things like that.

1:39:50.740 --> 1:39:53.860
 Right, and some people never get that

1:39:53.860 --> 1:39:55.140
 even at a very high dose.

1:39:55.140 --> 1:39:58.700
 So I think more broadly in terms of the psychedelic effects,

1:39:58.700 --> 1:40:00.140
 which isn't just perceptual,

1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:01.900
 unless we get into the level of,

1:40:01.900 --> 1:40:03.620
 as you were alluding to earlier,

1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:05.700
 a broader definition of perception,

1:40:05.700 --> 1:40:09.380
 like one's models of the world, the model of the self,

1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:12.060
 you can consider all of that perception

1:40:12.060 --> 1:40:15.340
 in terms of truly not sensation, but perception,

1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:18.860
 the construction of putting together reality.

1:40:18.860 --> 1:40:21.620
 So yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:25.260
 So the psychedelic effects are typically considered

1:40:25.260 --> 1:40:27.060
 to start for LSD around 100 micrograms.

1:40:27.060 --> 1:40:31.100
 So a 10th of a milligram is 100 micrograms.

1:40:31.100 --> 1:40:34.500
 So someone taking 100 micrograms of LSD,

1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:38.300
 nowadays people might mistakenly refer to that

1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:40.340
 as a microdose because it's micrograms,

1:40:40.340 --> 1:40:43.100
 but that's actually a macrodose of LSD.

1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:45.860
 Right, and that's one of the most common mistakes

1:40:45.860 --> 1:40:49.220
 or situations that people get into with microdosing

1:40:49.220 --> 1:40:50.780
 is they intend it to be a microdose,

1:40:50.780 --> 1:40:54.100
 but it ends up being a full-blown dose.

1:40:54.100 --> 1:40:57.220
 Now, people do, when they're working with LSD

1:40:57.220 --> 1:40:58.940
 and they're microdosing, they'll shoot for something

1:40:58.940 --> 1:41:03.900
 like say 10 milligrams, something in that range,

1:41:03.900 --> 1:41:06.020
 10, 20 milligrams of LSD.

1:41:06.020 --> 1:41:09.500
 So a 10th, a fifth, something of kind of

1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:12.420
 your entry-level psychedelic dose.

1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:15.700
 People's ability on the street to do this,

1:41:15.700 --> 1:41:17.300
 say the street as if they're on the corner,

1:41:17.300 --> 1:41:19.420
 but anyway, like outside of the medical profession

1:41:19.420 --> 1:41:21.260
 to do this, it varies as you can imagine.

1:41:21.260 --> 1:41:22.900
 And they're not measuring purity and molarity

1:41:22.900 --> 1:41:24.060
 or things like that, typically.

1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:25.300
 And there's ways to do it.

1:41:25.300 --> 1:41:27.180
 So even if you don't ultimately know the dose

1:41:27.180 --> 1:41:29.900
 that's in like the blotter paper of acid,

1:41:29.900 --> 1:41:31.500
 one could at least get a sense of like,

1:41:31.500 --> 1:41:35.300
 yeah, having one of those tabs is one of those hits

1:41:35.300 --> 1:41:37.260
 is a psychedelic experience.

1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:39.220
 They could do something like put it in water,

1:41:39.220 --> 1:41:41.580
 it's 100% aqueous soluble.

1:41:41.580 --> 1:41:44.540
 You could make sure it all gets into solution

1:41:44.540 --> 1:41:46.100
 and then volumetrically measure.

1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:48.220
 It's gonna be homogeneously distributed

1:41:48.220 --> 1:41:51.060
 so you can take 1 10th of that volume of water

1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:52.820
 after it's fully dissolved.

1:41:52.820 --> 1:41:54.060
 That whatever you started with,

1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:55.260
 you're gonna have a 10th of that dose.

1:41:55.260 --> 1:41:57.340
 So the people that are more sophisticated

1:41:57.340 --> 1:41:58.700
 will do things like that.

1:41:58.700 --> 1:42:00.420
 And when they're working with mushrooms,

1:42:00.420 --> 1:42:01.500
 they'll grow a bunch of mushrooms

1:42:01.500 --> 1:42:03.700
 and then they'll say, put it in a coffee grinder.

1:42:03.700 --> 1:42:05.660
 I'm not telling people to do this, by the way,

1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:07.580
 I'm just describing, so don't do this at home,

1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:10.060
 but like grind it all up so it's homogenous.

1:42:10.060 --> 1:42:11.540
 Because you can have like,

1:42:11.540 --> 1:42:14.700
 sort of taking two caps and a stem,

1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:18.300
 hey, this two caps and a stem that this buddy takes

1:42:18.300 --> 1:42:20.740
 has a different potency than this two caps and a stem

1:42:20.740 --> 1:42:21.780
 that the other buddy takes.

1:42:21.780 --> 1:42:24.260
 So people that are kind of in the know

1:42:24.260 --> 1:42:26.860
 will grind it all up into a homogenous powder

1:42:26.860 --> 1:42:29.140
 and they'll pack it into whatever size capsule

1:42:29.140 --> 1:42:30.020
 and they'll know that.

1:42:30.020 --> 1:42:31.860
 And again, even if they don't have,

1:42:31.860 --> 1:42:32.980
 sometimes they might have a buddy

1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:36.380
 that'll sneak it into the HPLC at their job or whatever,

1:42:36.380 --> 1:42:37.220
 if they have-

1:42:37.220 --> 1:42:38.060
 Not your lab.

1:42:38.060 --> 1:42:39.260
 Not my lab, that's never happened.

1:42:39.260 --> 1:42:40.500
 Yeah, seriously, never happened.

1:42:40.500 --> 1:42:43.340
 But they'll at least know that,

1:42:43.340 --> 1:42:46.740
 hey, I've got a sense of what two capsules do.

1:42:46.740 --> 1:42:49.340
 I've got a sense of what five capsules do.

1:42:49.340 --> 1:42:53.460
 But in reality, like that's not what people do.

1:42:53.460 --> 1:42:55.540
 They'll take a piece of blotter paper

1:42:55.540 --> 1:42:58.300
 and they get a tiny little pair of scissors,

1:42:58.300 --> 1:42:59.860
 a Swiss army knife pair of scissors,

1:42:59.860 --> 1:43:02.100
 and they'll cut up the tab of acid,

1:43:02.100 --> 1:43:05.260
 which is like a quarter inch square or something.

1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:07.460
 And they'll cut it up in 10 little pieces.

1:43:07.460 --> 1:43:09.500
 And it's like, you have no idea

1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:12.220
 like if it's equally distributed in that media.

1:43:12.220 --> 1:43:13.900
 Yeah, and we can chuckle about it.

1:43:13.900 --> 1:43:17.580
 And, but to me, one of the reasons

1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:19.980
 why this experiment around psychedelics,

1:43:19.980 --> 1:43:22.580
 this cultural experiment and this legal experiment,

1:43:24.300 --> 1:43:25.420
 we're seeing this now,

1:43:25.420 --> 1:43:29.860
 but this was all attempted once before in the 60s and 70s.

1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:32.540
 The difference was it was all out in the street.

1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:36.300
 The people in universities who were dabbling with this stuff,

1:43:36.300 --> 1:43:37.700
 most of them lost their jobs

1:43:37.700 --> 1:43:40.140
 or were asked to leave through-

1:43:40.140 --> 1:43:42.220
 They lost their funding for this research minimally

1:43:42.220 --> 1:43:43.580
 and they had to move on to other topics.

1:43:43.580 --> 1:43:44.420
 That's right.

1:43:44.420 --> 1:43:45.700
 So these are precarious times.

1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:50.540
 I mean, we're at a key moment where everyone assumes

1:43:50.540 --> 1:43:52.700
 that this is all going to be legal in a few years.

1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:56.260
 But I think that that's a premature assumption, frankly.

1:43:56.260 --> 1:44:00.780
 But, and let's touch on the legality

1:44:00.780 --> 1:44:02.540
 and some of the things that are happening now.

1:44:02.540 --> 1:44:06.540
 But what is microdosing psilocybin

1:44:06.540 --> 1:44:09.980
 versus the sorts of dosages that you described before

1:44:09.980 --> 1:44:12.540
 in the 10 to 40 milligram range?

1:44:12.540 --> 1:44:16.820
 I've heard of people taking one or two milligrams

1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:20.340
 of psilocybin every day as a way to quote, unquote,

1:44:20.340 --> 1:44:21.180
 and for those listening,

1:44:21.180 --> 1:44:23.100
 I'm just making air quotes with my fingers,

1:44:23.100 --> 1:44:24.340
 increase plasticity,

1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:26.740
 which is a term that I personally loathe

1:44:26.740 --> 1:44:28.140
 because what does that mean?

1:44:28.140 --> 1:44:30.380
 I mean, you don't really want your brain to be plastic

1:44:30.380 --> 1:44:33.860
 because you need to maintain your ability

1:44:33.860 --> 1:44:34.900
 to make predictions.

1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:35.740
 Yeah, I mean-

1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:38.300
 Ordering chaos, like prediction.

1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:40.060
 You need models of the world.

1:44:40.060 --> 1:44:41.260
 You need heuristics.

1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:44.420
 Plasticity is never the goal or be it plasticity

1:44:44.420 --> 1:44:45.660
 is never the goal.

1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:48.940
 The goal-directed plasticity is the goal, right?

1:44:48.940 --> 1:44:53.140
 Learning a language, reshaping your experience to a trauma,

1:44:53.140 --> 1:44:54.820
 altering the perception of self.

1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:58.340
 But plasticity is a process like-

1:44:58.340 --> 1:45:01.260
 Yeah, schizophrenia is a lot of plasticity.

1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:02.620
 Exactly, right, right.

1:45:02.620 --> 1:45:04.220
 It might even be, there's one theory

1:45:04.220 --> 1:45:06.460
 that it's extreme ongoing plasticity

1:45:06.460 --> 1:45:08.100
 and that's why people never create

1:45:08.100 --> 1:45:10.020
 stable representations of anything.

1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:13.540
 That's kind of a minority view out there,

1:45:13.540 --> 1:45:17.020
 but so what's the business with microdosing

1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:19.060
 and is there any clinical evidence

1:45:19.060 --> 1:45:20.660
 or peer-reviewed published evidence

1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:22.300
 that it works, quote unquote,

1:45:22.300 --> 1:45:24.780
 to make people feel better about anything?

1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:29.780
 So microdosing is the aim of taking,

1:45:30.580 --> 1:45:33.580
 again, something around a 10th of what would be

1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:35.620
 sort of an entry-level psychedelic dose

1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:36.780
 for whatever compound.

1:45:36.780 --> 1:45:39.460
 So like, yeah, with psilocybin,

1:45:39.460 --> 1:45:42.020
 usually people, almost never do people have

1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:43.060
 like pure psilocybin.

1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:44.860
 Like one milligram of psilocybin

1:45:44.860 --> 1:45:46.140
 would be in the range of a microdose.

1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:48.340
 More likely people are going to have mushrooms.

1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:53.180
 So like something like a half of a gram of mushroom.

1:45:53.180 --> 1:45:55.500
 I know people that are doing this every day.

1:45:55.500 --> 1:45:56.540
 They're doing these every day.

1:45:56.540 --> 1:45:59.180
 It's like in their, like the same way that I take,

1:45:59.180 --> 1:46:00.540
 like I'm personally,

1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:02.140
 I'm not recommending other people do this,

1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:05.300
 but I take some, I'm a fan of LCL carnitine lately.

1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:07.020
 I've been kind of experimenting with that a little bit,

1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:08.900
 which is not a psychedelic compound.

1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:09.860
 I take it every day.

1:46:09.860 --> 1:46:12.540
 And they're taking their psilocybin every day.

1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:13.460
 That's their supplement.

1:46:13.460 --> 1:46:14.300
 Yeah.

1:46:15.420 --> 1:46:19.180
 So yeah, the claims are, and there are a number of them,

1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:20.500
 there's two general ones.

1:46:20.500 --> 1:46:25.500
 One is sort of acting in place of the ADHD treating drugs.

1:46:25.980 --> 1:46:27.180
 So the psychomotor stimulants.

1:46:27.180 --> 1:46:29.700
 So like a better version of Adderall.

1:46:29.700 --> 1:46:32.700
 The other claims are essentially a better version

1:46:32.700 --> 1:46:35.860
 of the traditional antidepressants,

1:46:35.860 --> 1:46:37.620
 a better version of Prozac.

1:46:37.620 --> 1:46:39.860
 So people are taking both for attention deficit

1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:41.820
 and for depression.

1:46:41.820 --> 1:46:44.940
 Yeah, and the aspects of those disorders

1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:48.060
 that we all have a degree of,

1:46:48.060 --> 1:46:50.980
 just like amphetamine is going to increase the focus

1:46:50.980 --> 1:46:53.420
 at the right dose of anyone who takes amphetamine,

1:46:53.420 --> 1:46:57.860
 pretty much, whether you're ADHD diagnosed or not,

1:46:57.860 --> 1:47:02.660
 the idea is that there may not be necessarily a clear divide

1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:07.380
 between the therapeutic need and positive psychology,

1:47:07.380 --> 1:47:09.860
 even improving mood and focus.

1:47:11.340 --> 1:47:15.020
 So it's not necessarily correcting ADHD,

1:47:15.020 --> 1:47:19.180
 but improving focus to supercharge your life.

1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:20.660
 And so those are the claims.

1:47:23.340 --> 1:47:25.660
 So none of the peer reviewed studies

1:47:25.660 --> 1:47:28.380
 that have much credibility,

1:47:29.900 --> 1:47:32.620
 none of them have shown a benefit.

1:47:32.620 --> 1:47:33.460
 And they've tried.

1:47:33.460 --> 1:47:36.580
 Now there's only at this point four or five studies that,

1:47:36.580 --> 1:47:39.020
 and I think for things like this,

1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:43.180
 you really need double-blind research because the effects,

1:47:43.180 --> 1:47:45.340
 I mean, there was one study done in Amsterdam

1:47:45.340 --> 1:47:48.140
 where people knew they were taking psilocybin truffles,

1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:49.260
 basically same as mushrooms,

1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:50.860
 more like the roots of the mycelia.

1:47:50.860 --> 1:47:52.140
 Microdosing them.

1:47:52.140 --> 1:47:56.940
 Well, taking what would be considered a microdose

1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:01.220
 and then doing some cognitive measures before and after.

1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:02.340
 And the types of things that,

1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:03.380
 like a lot of cognitive measures

1:48:03.380 --> 1:48:06.020
 are measured on the order of reaction time

1:48:06.020 --> 1:48:06.860
 in milliseconds.

1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:08.820
 I mean, and the types of effects you get,

1:48:08.820 --> 1:48:09.700
 as you could imagine,

1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:13.740
 are ones that you would totally expect could be there

1:48:13.740 --> 1:48:18.460
 from either a practice effect or an expectancy effect,

1:48:18.460 --> 1:48:19.500
 a placebo effect.

1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:22.740
 So for something like these claimed,

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:26.780
 you can imagine a sort of an increased focus,

1:48:26.780 --> 1:48:28.500
 enhancement of cognition.

1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:32.060
 These are gonna be more subtle effects

1:48:32.060 --> 1:48:36.660
 that you really need a good placebo control for.

1:48:36.660 --> 1:48:40.700
 The handful of studies that have done that have shown,

1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:43.140
 they've ranged from finding no effect whatsoever

1:48:43.140 --> 1:48:44.940
 to just a little bit of impairment,

1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:48.860
 like impairing someone's ability to do time estimation

1:48:48.860 --> 1:48:49.940
 and production tasks.

1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:52.500
 So you want an accurate sense of time,

1:48:52.500 --> 1:48:54.820
 at least if you're navigating in the real world.

1:48:54.820 --> 1:48:57.620
 It's different if you're on the couch on a heroic dose

1:48:57.620 --> 1:48:59.380
 for therapeutic reasons where you're safe,

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:01.020
 but if you're crossing the street,

1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:03.860
 if you're in your work life,

1:49:03.860 --> 1:49:06.700
 which is the way people are claiming to use it,

1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:08.740
 it helps them be a better CEO.

1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:10.580
 Like you want an accurate sense of time.

1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:12.180
 So if anything, the data suggests

1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:14.820
 that it makes it a little bit less accurate.

1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:19.040
 And there's evidence that someone feels a little bit

1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:22.540
 impaired and they feel a little bit high.

1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:26.380
 So in terms of, you call that abuse liability in research,

1:49:26.380 --> 1:49:28.900
 not surprising, you take a little bit of a drug

1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:31.340
 that can result in some type of a high

1:49:31.340 --> 1:49:32.500
 and you take a little tiny bit of it,

1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:34.440
 you'll feel a little bit high.

1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:37.660
 So, you know, none of the,

1:49:37.660 --> 1:49:42.660
 so far, no studies have shown any increase in creativity,

1:49:44.260 --> 1:49:47.160
 enhancement of any form of cognition

1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:50.660
 or a sustained improvement in mood.

1:49:50.660 --> 1:49:53.860
 Now, no studies have actually looked

1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:57.820
 at the system of microdosing

1:49:57.820 --> 1:49:59.860
 that the aficionados are claiming.

1:49:59.860 --> 1:50:02.020
 And there's a couple of models out there,

1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:05.460
 but folks like Paul Stamets and others,

1:50:05.460 --> 1:50:06.940
 they'll have particular formulas.

1:50:06.940 --> 1:50:09.020
 They're like, you need to take it one day

1:50:09.020 --> 1:50:11.820
 and then take so many days off and take it every four days.

1:50:11.820 --> 1:50:13.740
 And I don't want to get into whose model is what,

1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:14.980
 but it's always something like that.

1:50:14.980 --> 1:50:18.620
 Some pattern of use, usually not every day.

1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:21.780
 And the claim is that it's not just, you know,

1:50:21.780 --> 1:50:23.940
 sometimes people get benefit that first time

1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:26.280
 when they take it, but they really say,

1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:27.940
 you need to be on it for a while.

1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:29.800
 Like a few weeks in, you may start to notice

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:32.620
 through this pattern of using it.

1:50:32.620 --> 1:50:35.460
 And you're feeling the benefits on those off days,

1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:40.460
 like the three or two days in between your active doses.

1:50:40.620 --> 1:50:41.600
 So those are the claims.

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:44.220
 Again, we don't know that there's any truth to that working,

1:50:44.220 --> 1:50:47.840
 but studies have not been done to model that.

1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:49.340
 So that's a big caveat.

1:50:49.340 --> 1:50:53.500
 We as a field, I say we as the scientific field,

1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:57.420
 have not done the studies to really model, you know,

1:50:57.420 --> 1:51:00.820
 what the real aficionados are claiming, you know,

1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:03.740
 where the therapeutic benefits come from.

1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:06.480
 That said, it's almost assuredly

1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:08.460
 there's a good amount of placebo there.

1:51:08.460 --> 1:51:11.620
 But the caveat to that is like almost everything

1:51:11.620 --> 1:51:13.500
 in medicine or therapeutics,

1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:16.380
 there's, it's going to have some degree of placebo there.

1:51:16.380 --> 1:51:19.940
 Belief effects are, I have a colleague at Stanford,

1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:22.380
 Aaliyah Crum, who has published really beautiful work

1:51:22.380 --> 1:51:26.580
 on belief effects that show that essentially

1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.480
 you give the same milkshake to two people,

1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:30.360
 you, or two groups of people,

1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:32.860
 you tell them that one contains a lot of nutrients,

1:51:32.860 --> 1:51:34.100
 the other is a low calorie shake.

1:51:34.100 --> 1:51:36.100
 They're, the insulin response.

1:51:36.100 --> 1:51:37.060
 Amazing.

1:51:37.060 --> 1:51:40.500
 Varies dramatically between the two or two groups

1:51:40.500 --> 1:51:45.060
 rather doing equivalent amounts of physical movement.

1:51:45.060 --> 1:51:46.940
 And you tell one group that it's going to be good for them

1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:47.860
 and help them lose weight.

1:51:47.860 --> 1:51:50.080
 And they lose on average eight to 12 pounds more

1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:53.220
 doing the exact same patterns of movement.

1:51:53.220 --> 1:51:55.420
 So, and I think that these belief effects boil down

1:51:55.420 --> 1:51:58.540
 to all sorts of kind of network-wide neuromodulation,

1:51:58.540 --> 1:51:59.380
 things of that sort.

1:51:59.380 --> 1:52:01.060
 And then the work at Harvard suggesting

1:52:01.060 --> 1:52:03.160
 that even if you don't have deception,

1:52:03.160 --> 1:52:05.580
 you give a placebo and say, this is a sugar pill.

1:52:05.580 --> 1:52:06.420
 Right.

1:52:06.420 --> 1:52:07.980
 You know, tell them that.

1:52:07.980 --> 1:52:09.180
 And they could still treat things.

1:52:09.180 --> 1:52:11.740
 I think irritable bowel was the first thing they looked at.

1:52:11.740 --> 1:52:12.580
 Right.

1:52:12.580 --> 1:52:14.940
 And so there's a huge, so there's a reality there.

1:52:14.940 --> 1:52:15.940
 Right.

1:52:15.940 --> 1:52:17.520
 There's a necessity in developing drugs

1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:19.060
 to make sure it's not only that,

1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:21.740
 but in the actual practice of medicine,

1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:23.100
 hopefully what you're always getting

1:52:23.100 --> 1:52:25.140
 is some underlying direct efficacy

1:52:25.140 --> 1:52:27.940
 plus the placebo that it enhances at.

1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:31.380
 Now, it could be that this is, the real question is,

1:52:31.380 --> 1:52:35.500
 is the microdosing, are those claims 100% placebo

1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:39.480
 or are they only part placebo and part real,

1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:41.240
 you know, quote unquote effect.

1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:45.100
 My bet is, and this is totally based on anecdotes

1:52:45.100 --> 1:52:47.740
 that I think there is probably a reality

1:52:47.740 --> 1:52:49.300
 to the antidepressant effects.

1:52:49.300 --> 1:52:51.300
 I find that more intriguing

1:52:51.300 --> 1:52:53.140
 because of the suffering with depression.

1:52:53.140 --> 1:52:53.980
 Right.

1:52:53.980 --> 1:52:56.200
 Even if it's, it wouldn't be as interesting

1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:59.180
 as I think what we're doing with high dose psilocybin

1:52:59.180 --> 1:53:01.740
 or psychedelics to treat depression.

1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.260
 It would be, if this is developed and there's a reality,

1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:06.820
 it would be more like a better, you know,

1:53:06.820 --> 1:53:10.060
 perhaps a better SSRI, a better Prozac.

1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:10.900
 Which are similar.

1:53:10.900 --> 1:53:11.740
 That being said, we need more tools

1:53:11.740 --> 1:53:14.100
 than fewer tools in the toolbox.

1:53:14.100 --> 1:53:15.860
 And it shouldn't be that surprise.

1:53:15.860 --> 1:53:19.420
 Like even before, going back to the tricyclics

1:53:19.420 --> 1:53:22.100
 and the MAO inhibitors, going back to the fifties,

1:53:22.100 --> 1:53:25.340
 like augmenting extracellular serotonin

1:53:25.340 --> 1:53:28.980
 in one way or another, for many people,

1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:31.340
 leads to a reduction in depressive symptoms.

1:53:31.340 --> 1:53:34.580
 It wouldn't be that crazy for chronically stimulating

1:53:34.580 --> 1:53:37.020
 a subtype of serotonin receptor

1:53:37.020 --> 1:53:38.860
 that you have an antidepressant effect.

1:53:38.860 --> 1:53:41.300
 So I think if I had put my bets on it,

1:53:41.300 --> 1:53:44.460
 that if there's anything real, it is in that category.

1:53:44.460 --> 1:53:46.460
 Although I'm very open to like, maybe there is something

1:53:46.460 --> 1:53:50.980
 to the creativity, to the, you know, improved cognition,

1:53:50.980 --> 1:53:53.900
 which covers many domains in and of itself.

1:53:53.900 --> 1:53:58.900
 But my greatest hopes are on the antidepressant effects.

1:54:00.540 --> 1:54:02.140
 That said, in the big picture,

1:54:02.140 --> 1:54:04.180
 I think all of the most interesting thing

1:54:04.180 --> 1:54:06.580
 about psychedelics are the heroic doses.

1:54:06.580 --> 1:54:08.260
 I mean, the idea that you can give something

1:54:08.260 --> 1:54:10.580
 one, two, three times, and you see improvements

1:54:10.580 --> 1:54:14.820
 in depression months later and in addiction,

1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:17.500
 you know, over a year later and with these, you know,

1:54:17.500 --> 1:54:20.100
 people dealing with potentially terminal illness.

1:54:20.100 --> 1:54:23.860
 I mean, it's, I mean, I'm interested in big effects

1:54:23.860 --> 1:54:25.140
 and I don't think you're ever going to get

1:54:25.140 --> 1:54:26.620
 the really big effects.

1:54:26.620 --> 1:54:30.180
 There's also some concern that almost all of these

1:54:30.180 --> 1:54:34.060
 common, the more common psychedelics, even counting MDMA,

1:54:34.060 --> 1:54:37.300
 they have serotonin 2B agonist effects.

1:54:37.300 --> 1:54:42.300
 And agonizing serotonin 2B has been shown to lead

1:54:42.660 --> 1:54:47.660
 to heart valve formation problems, morphology issues.

1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:50.620
 So valvulopathy.

1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:53.460
 And so this is why Fen-Phen was pulled from the market.

1:54:53.460 --> 1:54:54.580
 The diet drug.

1:54:54.580 --> 1:54:55.420
 Yes.

1:54:55.420 --> 1:54:56.260
 Very effective diet drug.

1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:57.100
 Right, right.

1:54:57.100 --> 1:54:59.740
 And it was the portion of that combination

1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:04.740
 that had the serotonin 2B activity that was the problem.

1:55:04.740 --> 1:55:07.180
 And so we don't know.

1:55:07.180 --> 1:55:10.980
 So all of the toxicologists I've ever spoken to about this

1:55:10.980 --> 1:55:13.260
 would, you know, say, and cardiologists say like,

1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:16.380
 look, hey, if there was some concern there,

1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:18.340
 it's not applicable to the whole idea

1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:20.900
 of you taking something a few times therapeutically

1:55:20.900 --> 1:55:21.900
 within a lifetime.

1:55:21.900 --> 1:55:26.140
 But the idea of taking something like, you know,

1:55:26.140 --> 1:55:28.940
 twice a week for years.

1:55:28.940 --> 1:55:31.220
 I mean, even the hippies back in the sixties

1:55:31.220 --> 1:55:32.380
 weren't doing that, right?

1:55:32.380 --> 1:55:33.860
 Like there's not even these natural,

1:55:33.860 --> 1:55:38.860
 and even if there was some heart valve disease problem

1:55:39.860 --> 1:55:42.660
 that stemmed from psychedelic use,

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.300
 who's connecting those dots?

1:55:44.300 --> 1:55:46.300
 That's not showing up in the clinical charts

1:55:46.300 --> 1:55:47.260
 for anyone to figure out.

1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:49.740
 So there is, and just theoretically,

1:55:49.740 --> 1:55:51.940
 there is more of a concern.

1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:55.220
 If something's going to happen with heart valves,

1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:58.900
 it's more likely that those issues would arise

1:55:58.900 --> 1:56:00.500
 when someone's taking these things like, yeah,

1:56:00.500 --> 1:56:04.220
 let's say twice a week for the next five years.

1:56:04.220 --> 1:56:05.940
 And so I do want to throw that out to people

1:56:05.940 --> 1:56:07.020
 to really consider.

1:56:07.020 --> 1:56:08.740
 Right, yeah, it's something I hadn't heard before

1:56:08.740 --> 1:56:11.180
 that in micro sounds safer,

1:56:11.180 --> 1:56:14.260
 micro dosing as opposed to heroic or macro dosing.

1:56:14.260 --> 1:56:18.140
 And yet, unless, and in the context of your lab

1:56:18.140 --> 1:56:20.940
 and other labs doing similar work,

1:56:20.940 --> 1:56:23.340
 you've got this people checking blood pressure,

1:56:23.340 --> 1:56:25.060
 you've got people that are really monitoring

1:56:25.060 --> 1:56:27.300
 your psychological and physical safety.

1:56:27.300 --> 1:56:28.860
 When people are out there micro dosing,

1:56:28.860 --> 1:56:30.900
 it sounds like there's the potential,

1:56:30.900 --> 1:56:35.420
 either through this serotonin 5-H2B receptor

1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:37.540
 or other mechanism that maybe there could be

1:56:37.540 --> 1:56:40.060
 some kind of cumulative negative effects.

1:56:41.540 --> 1:56:44.340
 And I think that's a really important consideration.

1:56:44.340 --> 1:56:46.260
 So I'm glad you brought it up.

1:56:46.260 --> 1:56:47.540
 What about kids?

1:56:47.540 --> 1:56:50.700
 So the brain is very plastic early in life.

1:56:50.700 --> 1:56:53.460
 It becomes less plastic as we age,

1:56:53.460 --> 1:56:56.140
 although it maintains some degree of plasticity

1:56:56.140 --> 1:56:57.660
 throughout the lifespan.

1:56:57.660 --> 1:57:01.660
 The year 25, not the year 25,

1:57:01.660 --> 1:57:06.660
 but rather the age 25 years is sort of an inflection point

1:57:06.900 --> 1:57:10.420
 where the rigidity of the nervous system

1:57:10.420 --> 1:57:11.620
 seems to really take off.

1:57:11.620 --> 1:57:14.060
 Of course, people don't wake up on their 25th birthday

1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:16.300
 and find they have no neuroplasticity,

1:57:16.300 --> 1:57:17.740
 whereas the day before they had a lot,

1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:20.580
 these are, it's plus or minus, whatever it is,

1:57:20.580 --> 1:57:23.700
 a year or two, but depends on the individual.

1:57:23.700 --> 1:57:28.700
 However, the young brain is very plastic.

1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:35.660
 And I could imagine there could be great risks,

1:57:35.980 --> 1:57:37.420
 who knows, maybe even benefits,

1:57:37.420 --> 1:57:40.020
 but I'm certainly not thinking about those.

1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:42.620
 I'm mainly thinking about the risks

1:57:42.620 --> 1:57:46.220
 for young people taking psychedelics.

1:57:46.220 --> 1:57:49.940
 Are there any trials looking at people in clinical trials

1:57:49.940 --> 1:57:51.300
 this would be under the age of 18?

1:57:51.300 --> 1:57:54.420
 Has anyone explored this in a rigorous way?

1:57:54.420 --> 1:57:57.660
 Given the potential to exacerbate psychotic symptoms

1:57:57.660 --> 1:57:59.500
 and bipolar symptoms in some people,

1:58:00.980 --> 1:58:03.300
 is there heightened risk of that?

1:58:03.300 --> 1:58:06.340
 What's the story with age of use and psychedelics

1:58:06.340 --> 1:58:07.540
 for therapeutic purposes?

1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:10.060
 There's no formal research,

1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:13.060
 although there's a very high chance that there will be.

1:58:13.060 --> 1:58:14.820
 And so this is one of the very interesting things

1:58:14.820 --> 1:58:17.420
 folks may not realize or appreciate

1:58:17.420 --> 1:58:19.580
 about the FDA approval process.

1:58:19.580 --> 1:58:22.140
 So the FDA already in multiple instances

1:58:22.140 --> 1:58:26.860
 has signaled that they want to see those studies before.

1:58:26.860 --> 1:58:31.860
 Well, not before it's approved necessarily for adults,

1:58:32.780 --> 1:58:34.380
 but they're going to eventually want to see it.

1:58:34.380 --> 1:58:38.260
 In fact, so the MAPS group that's developing MDMA for PTSD,

1:58:38.260 --> 1:58:41.460
 they've already signaled

1:58:41.460 --> 1:58:44.900
 that that's kind of on the list of interest.

1:58:44.900 --> 1:58:49.900
 And there's even some incentives in the FDA pathways

1:58:50.020 --> 1:58:53.500
 for incentivizing folks to explore

1:58:53.500 --> 1:58:55.780
 that use in young people.

1:58:55.780 --> 1:58:57.780
 I know in some of the work that I helped with

1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:02.780
 in pushing psilocybin into phase 2B clinical research,

1:59:05.020 --> 1:59:09.540
 the FDA said, well, why can't you give this to kids?

1:59:09.540 --> 1:59:12.780
 It's like, are you aware that depression

1:59:12.780 --> 1:59:15.340
 is a problem with adolescents?

1:59:17.020 --> 1:59:18.300
 And it's really interesting

1:59:18.300 --> 1:59:23.060
 because this FDA is very concerned about pseudospecificity.

1:59:23.060 --> 1:59:26.020
 The idea that you put out a drug and say,

1:59:26.020 --> 1:59:28.820
 oh, this is good for men, but not women.

1:59:28.820 --> 1:59:31.580
 This is good for black folks, but not white folks.

1:59:31.580 --> 1:59:34.660
 And now sometimes there's a very good rationale for that.

1:59:34.660 --> 1:59:36.700
 Like when we're talking about hormones

1:59:36.700 --> 1:59:40.460
 and for a specific, for men versus women.

1:59:40.460 --> 1:59:43.700
 And there's certain issues,

1:59:45.180 --> 1:59:47.780
 certain disease say it's like maybe sickle cell anemia

1:59:47.780 --> 1:59:48.620
 that's more relevant to-

1:59:48.620 --> 1:59:49.460
 It tastes excellent.

1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.020
 Yeah, exactly.

1:59:51.020 --> 1:59:53.940
 But absent of something that they're very concerned

1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:56.740
 about saying, oh, this is for this type of person,

1:59:56.740 --> 1:59:57.980
 but not that type of person.

1:59:57.980 --> 1:59:59.580
 So age is one of those things.

1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:01.900
 And also this recognition,

2:00:01.900 --> 2:00:06.380
 much like the emphasis at NIH with rodent studies

2:00:06.380 --> 2:00:07.300
 and human studies that like,

2:00:07.300 --> 2:00:08.780
 you can't just say you're studying men

2:00:08.780 --> 2:00:11.700
 or just you need a rationale if you're only-

2:00:11.700 --> 2:00:15.340
 Yeah, to be clear to people, it's a recent switch,

2:00:15.340 --> 2:00:19.820
 but there's a stipulation in every federally funded grant

2:00:19.820 --> 2:00:22.820
 that both sexes, we don't refer to gender

2:00:22.820 --> 2:00:26.460
 in scientific studies, unless it's a study of gender per se.

2:00:26.460 --> 2:00:28.860
 We refer to sex, meaning biological sex.

2:00:28.860 --> 2:00:32.180
 So that there's a stipulation that in order to receive

2:00:32.180 --> 2:00:33.460
 and continue to receive funding,

2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:37.680
 you have to do studies on both males and females

2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:39.860
 of that species, including humans.

2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:42.040
 And at least, even if you're not powered for it,

2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:44.660
 at least looking at that in exploratory analysis,

2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:48.260
 like as a grant reviewer, I'm charged with looking at,

2:00:48.260 --> 2:00:49.720
 did they address like sex

2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:51.780
 as a biologically relevant variable?

2:00:51.780 --> 2:00:55.420
 Right, does the same drug have different effects

2:00:55.420 --> 2:00:56.740
 in males versus females?

2:00:56.740 --> 2:00:58.700
 Right, and you can at least look at the trends,

2:00:58.700 --> 2:01:00.140
 even again, if you're underpowered

2:01:00.140 --> 2:01:02.940
 to look at those between subject type effects.

2:01:02.940 --> 2:01:04.980
 Which is a great shift that didn't exist

2:01:04.980 --> 2:01:09.980
 in 10 years ago, sounds like we're both on grants panels.

2:01:10.500 --> 2:01:12.500
 As study section members, you didn't have to do that.

2:01:12.500 --> 2:01:14.560
 Now it's an important biological variable.

2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:16.180
 If you don't look at that,

2:01:16.180 --> 2:01:18.600
 you essentially won't get your funding.

2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:19.960
 And age is a similar thing.

2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:21.180
 So it's the whole idea like,

2:01:21.180 --> 2:01:23.940
 man, if something could help kids, like what's the rationale?

2:01:23.940 --> 2:01:24.960
 So I think there's going to be,

2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:27.520
 now obviously you're going to have in those studies

2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:31.020
 at least just as much, probably more,

2:01:31.020 --> 2:01:34.720
 it should be more of a cautionary approach.

2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:36.020
 It's probably going to be,

2:01:37.260 --> 2:01:39.260
 would certainly whatever disease states are looked at

2:01:39.260 --> 2:01:41.320
 are going to have to be probably treatment resistant,

2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:42.440
 at least as a first step.

2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:43.280
 You know, hey-

2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:44.100
 Suicidal depression.

2:01:44.100 --> 2:01:46.660
 Yeah, yeah, and so all of that in the mix,

2:01:46.660 --> 2:01:51.060
 but hey, you know, if this stuff really helps people,

2:01:51.060 --> 2:01:54.140
 you know, that are 25 or 30,

2:01:54.140 --> 2:01:57.740
 like what's the rationale that it won't help a younger person?

2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:00.100
 You know, and there's these generic kind of concerns

2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:02.720
 about the developing nervous system

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:05.300
 is more susceptible to problem.

2:02:05.300 --> 2:02:06.460
 I mean, it cuts both ways

2:02:06.460 --> 2:02:10.060
 because it's also more plastic generally and adaptable

2:02:10.060 --> 2:02:12.700
 and maybe resilient to injury in certain ways.

2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:14.260
 But, you know, you hear the rhetoric

2:02:14.260 --> 2:02:16.280
 about kids, their brains and drugs,

2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:19.460
 and it's like the developing brain is a special concern.

2:02:20.740 --> 2:02:22.140
 So yeah, but I think we're going to be

2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:23.800
 seeing research eventually.

2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:24.720
 That's interesting.

2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:29.720
 I went to the high school that is infamous, sadly,

2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:33.340
 Gunn High School, for having the highest degree,

2:02:33.340 --> 2:02:36.100
 at least at one point, of suicide rate.

2:02:36.100 --> 2:02:36.940
 Wow.

2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:39.020
 And a very large number of suicides.

2:02:39.020 --> 2:02:41.440
 This was written up in the Times and elsewhere.

2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:44.020
 Is it a very academically successful school?

2:02:44.020 --> 2:02:44.860
 It's a very academically-

2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:45.900
 So there's a lot of high pressure.

2:02:45.900 --> 2:02:47.900
 Yeah, very academically demanding school

2:02:47.900 --> 2:02:50.220
 to the point where they've restricted,

2:02:50.220 --> 2:02:54.400
 the kids will meet often at 6.30 a.m. or 6 a.m. before school

2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:56.420
 for study groups and things of that sort.

2:02:56.420 --> 2:02:58.620
 So some of it may relate to that.

2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:00.160
 But I have to say that even prior

2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:03.240
 to all that academic pressure,

2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:06.680
 when I went there, the pressure wasn't like that.

2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:10.660
 You know, we had an unusual number of suicides

2:03:10.660 --> 2:03:11.800
 for whatever reason.

2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:16.800
 And, you know, and so the idea of kids being prescribed,

2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:19.340
 and I want to emphasize prescribed, not just using,

2:03:19.340 --> 2:03:22.120
 but prescribed psychedelics for therapeutic purposes,

2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:24.560
 I think might make some people balk.

2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:29.460
 But the idea of kids killing themselves

2:03:29.460 --> 2:03:30.780
 should also make people balk.

2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:34.180
 And so I'm relieved to hear that there's going to be

2:03:34.180 --> 2:03:37.380
 a rational, scientific, safe,

2:03:37.380 --> 2:03:40.020
 clinical trial-based exploration of this.

2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:45.380
 I want to ask you about the current status

2:03:45.380 --> 2:03:47.000
 of these drugs and compounds.

2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:51.260
 I'm pretty active on social media,

2:03:51.260 --> 2:03:53.260
 more so on Instagram than on Twitter.

2:03:53.260 --> 2:03:57.280
 But as I have been on Twitter a little bit more recently,

2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:00.700
 I've noticed that there's a lot of dialogue

2:04:00.700 --> 2:04:02.560
 around your account and other people's accounts

2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:04.780
 around a couple of themes related to psychedelics.

2:04:04.780 --> 2:04:08.420
 First of all, what is the status of the transition

2:04:08.420 --> 2:04:11.980
 to legality for prescription purposes?

2:04:11.980 --> 2:04:14.500
 So medical doctors, MDs,

2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:17.980
 prescribing it legally for therapeutic purposes.

2:04:17.980 --> 2:04:19.060
 That's the first question.

2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:22.080
 The second question is what is the status

2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:25.580
 as it relates to possession and criminal charges?

2:04:25.580 --> 2:04:28.740
 So for a long time, I lived in Oakland,

2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:32.060
 where we were one day told not too long ago,

2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:35.220
 it is now quote-unquote decriminalized is what I was told.

2:04:35.220 --> 2:04:37.300
 I double-check people.

2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:38.820
 But what does that mean?

2:04:38.820 --> 2:04:41.780
 And then the other issue and the third question,

2:04:41.780 --> 2:04:43.480
 and we can parse these one by one,

2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:46.980
 is this issue of, let's just say I'm aware

2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:50.340
 of a lot of investor dollars going into companies

2:04:50.340 --> 2:04:55.340
 that are essentially companies focused on psychedelics

2:04:55.680 --> 2:04:58.800
 as therapeutics or psychedelics generally.

2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:02.220
 I have to assume that they are investing in anticipation

2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:04.100
 of a shift in the legal status.

2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:07.620
 And there's a lot of interest now,

2:05:07.620 --> 2:05:11.500
 like will psilocybin become a taxable thing

2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:12.380
 just like marijuana?

2:05:12.380 --> 2:05:14.360
 So let's start with the question of like,

2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:18.060
 what is going on in the US legally?

2:05:18.060 --> 2:05:23.060
 Is it illegal to possess and sell and use these compounds?

2:05:24.420 --> 2:05:26.500
 My understanding is you can still go to jail

2:05:26.500 --> 2:05:30.260
 for having these compounds in your possession

2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:31.100
 or for selling.

2:05:31.100 --> 2:05:35.580
 Right, so even though the legal landscape

2:05:35.580 --> 2:05:38.260
 is very different than with cannabis,

2:05:38.260 --> 2:05:39.700
 there are some similarities.

2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:42.080
 So one of the similarities is that regardless

2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:45.800
 of what local municipal, whether city or state

2:05:45.800 --> 2:05:50.580
 is decriminalized, and that word itself can mean many things.

2:05:50.580 --> 2:05:53.820
 So the devil, some forms of decriminalization

2:05:53.820 --> 2:05:56.820
 is close to what folks would call legalization

2:05:56.820 --> 2:05:59.260
 and others are like pretty weak,

2:05:59.260 --> 2:06:01.780
 just saying we suggest that the police

2:06:01.780 --> 2:06:03.860
 make it their lowest law enforcement priority,

2:06:03.860 --> 2:06:04.700
 that type of thing.

2:06:04.700 --> 2:06:05.540
 So they can choose.

2:06:05.540 --> 2:06:06.380
 Turn the other kind of thing.

2:06:06.380 --> 2:06:09.200
 Right, but even the cops can still choose to.

2:06:09.200 --> 2:06:12.260
 But someone could get pulled over for one thing searched

2:06:12.260 --> 2:06:15.300
 and then by definition, if it's illegal and they find it,

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.940
 then they have to do something about it.

2:06:17.940 --> 2:06:19.560
 And that'll probably be determined

2:06:19.560 --> 2:06:22.460
 by both judicial precedent.

2:06:22.460 --> 2:06:23.600
 Is it going to be thrown out?

2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:25.940
 And just the local prosecutor,

2:06:25.940 --> 2:06:27.520
 even before, are they going to choose,

2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.100
 even at post arrest are going to pursue

2:06:30.100 --> 2:06:31.940
 to really go after those charges,

2:06:31.940 --> 2:06:33.700
 make those charges stick.

2:06:33.700 --> 2:06:34.900
 So I think that's still in play

2:06:34.900 --> 2:06:36.420
 and is going to depend on the municipality.

2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:38.960
 But like cannabis, federally,

2:06:38.960 --> 2:06:40.620
 these are all schedule one compounds.

2:06:40.620 --> 2:06:41.860
 Which means they're illegal.

2:06:41.860 --> 2:06:43.860
 Which means they're illegal.

2:06:43.860 --> 2:06:46.140
 The caveat to that, just as has always been the case

2:06:46.140 --> 2:06:49.340
 since Prop 215 in California with cannabis in 96,

2:06:49.340 --> 2:06:54.180
 is that, hey, 99% of drug enforcement

2:06:54.180 --> 2:06:55.720
 is done at the local and state level.

2:06:55.720 --> 2:06:59.580
 The DEA, which is the federal level of law enforcement,

2:06:59.580 --> 2:07:02.740
 is a tiny fraction of the arrests.

2:07:02.740 --> 2:07:04.860
 I mean, most people that are arrested for any drug

2:07:04.860 --> 2:07:09.860
 are done by local or state level authorities.

2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:13.180
 But it's still technically illegal.

2:07:13.180 --> 2:07:15.980
 And so you can, and they could potentially,

2:07:15.980 --> 2:07:18.420
 and depending on the ambiguity of local law,

2:07:18.420 --> 2:07:20.140
 even those local officials could charge you

2:07:20.140 --> 2:07:21.800
 with a federal crime.

2:07:22.780 --> 2:07:27.100
 And theoretically, the feds could always come in.

2:07:27.100 --> 2:07:30.980
 Now, although you'll, again, a similar case

2:07:30.980 --> 2:07:33.380
 with the whole cannabis history,

2:07:33.380 --> 2:07:36.960
 it was the feds came in in the early days,

2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:39.820
 but the folks that were basically highly visible.

2:07:39.820 --> 2:07:42.620
 They went after Tommy Chong for selling bongs.

2:07:42.620 --> 2:07:45.420
 But I remember him being on The Tonight Show one time,

2:07:45.420 --> 2:07:47.340
 and I think it was back in the Jay Leno days,

2:07:47.340 --> 2:07:50.220
 he says, but oh, along the Santa Monica boardwalk,

2:07:50.220 --> 2:07:51.580
 like every shop sells bongs.

2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:53.720
 How did you go to prison for a half year for bongs?

2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:55.220
 It's because he was, and they're-

2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:56.060
 Because he was famous.

2:07:56.060 --> 2:07:57.820
 Because he was Tommy Chong.

2:07:57.820 --> 2:08:02.340
 And there was some high profile cannabis groups

2:08:02.340 --> 2:08:04.500
 that were distributing it and they were very vocal.

2:08:04.500 --> 2:08:06.900
 Those were the ones rated by the DEA in the early days,

2:08:06.900 --> 2:08:08.920
 not the ones kind of keeping to themselves,

2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:10.540
 keeping it quiet and just doing their thing.

2:08:10.540 --> 2:08:14.600
 So there's always the potential for selective enforcement.

2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:17.260
 And so, and like this initiative in Oregon,

2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:22.260
 which is a state level legalization of psilocybin therapy,

2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:24.160
 which is really interesting.

2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:26.620
 Part of their plan for two years is to figure out

2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:30.300
 how to integrate with the federal level.

2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:32.100
 And I don't know how that's going to go

2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:36.020
 because unless you rewrite the Controlled Substances Act,

2:08:36.020 --> 2:08:37.460
 it seems like the best you're going to get

2:08:37.460 --> 2:08:40.920
 is a tolerance from the federal government.

2:08:42.940 --> 2:08:47.940
 And that could be very, hey, you change administrations.

2:08:48.060 --> 2:08:51.020
 And this is psilocybin by a prescription

2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:54.460
 from a medical doctor, or you're talking about therapists

2:08:55.620 --> 2:09:00.260
 who have master's degrees or PhDs or self-appointed coaches

2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:04.460
 or something like that, administering psilocybin,

2:09:04.460 --> 2:09:06.740
 but without any oversight.

2:09:06.740 --> 2:09:09.480
 So this is all getting figured out in the Oregon case.

2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:11.480
 And again, there's that two-year period of like,

2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:13.100
 basically we're going to figure this out.

2:09:13.100 --> 2:09:13.940
 And so there's-

2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:15.420
 What is it with Oregon?

2:09:15.420 --> 2:09:18.220
 They're ahead with a lot of, you know, euthanasia.

2:09:18.220 --> 2:09:19.580
 I love the state of Oregon.

2:09:19.580 --> 2:09:22.540
 But it's interesting how you have these pockets.

2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:24.720
 Oregon, Vermont seems to be one.

2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:26.540
 You know, you've got these kind of pockets

2:09:26.540 --> 2:09:30.720
 where people are experimental with plant compounds.

2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:33.420
 They seem to be green, woodsy areas for,

2:09:33.420 --> 2:09:35.900
 at least in my mind, but there's sort of a culture

2:09:35.900 --> 2:09:39.240
 around plants and the use of plants as therapeutics.

2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:41.060
 And combine that with the West,

2:09:41.060 --> 2:09:46.060
 just more geographically of more of the anti-federalism,

2:09:46.740 --> 2:09:49.580
 the anti, I mean, the Oregon ranchers from several years ago

2:09:49.580 --> 2:09:53.820
 that held up the, you know, the whatever wildlife place,

2:09:53.820 --> 2:09:55.780
 you know, and that was a big showdown with the feds,

2:09:55.780 --> 2:09:59.060
 you know, and the, you know, just kind of the West

2:09:59.060 --> 2:10:02.280
 is kind of known for, you know, more of those issues.

2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:03.500
 So you combine the two,

2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:05.820
 the hippie dippie, California, Oregon vibe,

2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:06.660
 with the kind of anti-

2:10:06.660 --> 2:10:08.660
 Although I would argue it's becoming less hippie dippie

2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:11.300
 than, although it was,

2:10:11.300 --> 2:10:13.140
 that there's always been a tradition,

2:10:13.140 --> 2:10:15.460
 not just in the culture around drugs,

2:10:15.460 --> 2:10:18.380
 but certainly in academia and in tech, et cetera,

2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:21.540
 that the West has been a place

2:10:21.540 --> 2:10:25.180
 where people have tried to throw off traditionalism

2:10:25.180 --> 2:10:28.700
 and kind of lineage and like who your parents are,

2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:32.820
 what school you went to, and the past

2:10:32.820 --> 2:10:34.980
 as a determinant of what's next

2:10:34.980 --> 2:10:36.720
 and exciting about the future.

2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:39.700
 Whereas, and here we are an East Coast institution guy

2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:41.340
 and a West Coast institution guy.

2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:46.140
 I think that it's this idea of kind of innovation

2:10:46.140 --> 2:10:49.120
 and the future versus do we stay grounded

2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:51.620
 in history and tradition.

2:10:51.620 --> 2:10:53.860
 And of course there are great institutions on both sides.

2:10:53.860 --> 2:10:56.260
 What's interesting is that Hopkins,

2:10:56.260 --> 2:10:57.900
 Johns Hopkins Medical School,

2:10:57.900 --> 2:11:02.000
 I think of as a real like East Coast academic institution.

2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:05.940
 It is on the East Coast, but here you are

2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:09.320
 doing these very pioneering and important

2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:12.820
 and exploratory studies in a,

2:11:12.820 --> 2:11:14.960
 certainly not a hippie dippie environment.

2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:15.980
 Right, oh yeah.

2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:17.980
 Very conservative psychiatry department,

2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:19.580
 even amongst psychiatry departments.

2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:21.940
 And as a psychologist in a psychiatry department,

2:11:21.940 --> 2:11:25.160
 psychiatry is certainly more conservative than psychology,

2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:26.320
 even within academics.

2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:28.260
 But even amongst psychiatry departments,

2:11:28.260 --> 2:11:30.700
 it's a very conservative department.

2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:32.960
 So we've got the law at the federal level.

2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:35.820
 We've got the law at the state and local level.

2:11:35.820 --> 2:11:37.740
 And then we've got this question

2:11:37.740 --> 2:11:40.560
 of whether or not it's going to be physicians.

2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:44.220
 So MDs, people with PhDs or master's degrees,

2:11:44.220 --> 2:11:47.580
 or whether or not it will be kind of a free-for-all

2:11:47.580 --> 2:11:48.740
 for consumption.

2:11:48.740 --> 2:11:49.780
 And the life coaches.

2:11:49.780 --> 2:11:52.220
 The life coaches and the general public.

2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:55.860
 I mean, cannabis, I'm not a pot smoker.

2:11:55.860 --> 2:11:57.640
 It's never appealed to me.

2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:59.900
 That's just me and my pharmacology.

2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:04.900
 But you can buy cannabis most places in the U.S.

2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:08.840
 without a ton of risk, it seems, right?

2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:12.680
 Are we going to see a time in which

2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:15.880
 you can essentially go into a shop

2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:19.540
 on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, California?

2:12:19.540 --> 2:12:21.580
 And right now you can go buy marijuana

2:12:21.580 --> 2:12:23.300
 if you have a marijuana carta.

2:12:23.300 --> 2:12:24.200
 That's my understanding.

2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:27.100
 I see a lot of people going in and out of these stores.

2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:28.820
 The police certainly have no problem with it.

2:12:28.820 --> 2:12:29.880
 Is there going to come a time

2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:32.660
 where people can just go buy psilocybin?

2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:33.500
 Do you think-

2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:35.340
 Like they do in Amsterdam and have for a long time.

2:12:35.340 --> 2:12:36.740
 Do you think that time is coming?

2:12:39.020 --> 2:12:42.920
 I think so at a certain point.

2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:46.500
 And I don't know how long.

2:12:48.660 --> 2:12:52.060
 It's hard to imagine our current level

2:12:52.060 --> 2:12:57.060
 of drug criminalization holding up for,

2:12:57.060 --> 2:12:58.940
 and I'm thinking like large spans of time,

2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:00.360
 like really in a hundred years

2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:02.200
 are we going to be doing this 500 years?

2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:03.040
 Like how could that?

2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:04.580
 It's not going to be sustainable.

2:13:04.580 --> 2:13:06.140
 But in five years, for instance.

2:13:06.140 --> 2:13:09.720
 So I don't think so in the United States.

2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:13.680
 I do think eventually you're going to see something like that

2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:15.080
 because there's going to be no way.

2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:16.660
 And I think we're going to,

2:13:16.660 --> 2:13:21.420
 I hope that we're going to eventually come so strongly.

2:13:21.420 --> 2:13:25.500
 We're going to move on from this model of criminalizing drugs

2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:28.180
 that we're really going to focus on regulating drugs

2:13:28.180 --> 2:13:29.620
 at the right level for that drug.

2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:33.280
 And I like the word regulation better than legalization.

2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:36.700
 So, I mean, I could imagine what one day regulation,

2:13:36.700 --> 2:13:38.980
 smart regulation might mean for psychedelics.

2:13:38.980 --> 2:13:41.640
 Maybe it could mean that there will be,

2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:44.800
 whether or not you have a diagnosis of a problem,

2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:47.000
 it may be that even for personal exploration,

2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:48.600
 you can do this legally,

2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:51.420
 but you first have to maybe take a court, get a drive.

2:13:51.420 --> 2:13:52.980
 And this has been, I'm not the first to say this,

2:13:52.980 --> 2:13:55.200
 but get equivalent of a driver's license.

2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:58.040
 You have to go to get some sort of training.

2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:00.700
 Maybe your first number of experiences

2:14:00.700 --> 2:14:05.060
 need to be with trained guides who can facilitate it.

2:14:05.060 --> 2:14:06.880
 And then the public health information

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:10.760
 for anyone using this that this is what riskier use is.

2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:12.040
 All use is going to have risk.

2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:13.260
 This is what riskier use is.

2:14:13.260 --> 2:14:14.700
 This is less risky use.

2:14:14.700 --> 2:14:16.200
 These are the factors.

2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:18.100
 So I think eventually we're going to be getting for any,

2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:20.900
 but I would say the same thing for like methamphetamine

2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:24.740
 and heroin and cocaine, like all of these drugs,

2:14:24.740 --> 2:14:27.120
 it's hard to imagine the current approach

2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:29.560
 of just feeding a black market

2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:32.880
 and really exacerbating a lot of the harms from drugs.

2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.440
 You know, that happens under the current model.

2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:38.120
 It's hard to imagine that maintaining.

2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:40.760
 That isn't to say, I think it should be

2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.560
 in all of the 7-Elevens, you know,

2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:44.400
 sold to kids at the other extreme.

2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:45.720
 I would hope not.

2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:48.180
 But I do think it's probably not going to be soon

2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:50.060
 in the United States.

2:14:50.060 --> 2:14:52.380
 I do want to make the major point that

2:14:52.380 --> 2:14:55.280
 even if psychedelics had never been made illegal,

2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:59.000
 I think the trajectory of the medical research right now

2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:00.700
 would still need to happen.

2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:03.880
 If it's effective as an antidepressant,

2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:06.840
 like we need it to be, you know,

2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:09.200
 there's all the evidence suggesting that

2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:10.500
 whatever disorder we're talking about,

2:15:10.500 --> 2:15:12.160
 the efficacy is going to be increased

2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:16.020
 and the risks are going to be mitigated drastically

2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:18.120
 in the types of models we're talking about

2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:20.480
 with the screening, with the preparation,

2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:22.720
 with the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy

2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:23.560
 or what have you,

2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:25.440
 depending on the disorder you're treating,

2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:28.520
 with the integration afterwards with the professionals.

2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:32.580
 So we would be doing it anyway.

2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:34.360
 So it's not like this versus that.

2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:37.080
 So I don't see it as a race between the decriminalization

2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:38.840
 or legalization of these compounds

2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:40.360
 versus their medical development.

2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:42.120
 Some people who are psychedelic fans

2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:47.360
 get all into a bunch about the medical development.

2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:50.760
 They say, you guys want to like, you want to keep it only

2:15:50.760 --> 2:15:54.000
 for your medical research and I retire

2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:57.360
 and you want to be in control of it as academics.

2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:00.800
 And my take is I didn't make it illegal for anyone.

2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:03.340
 We're only moving the needle in one direction.

2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:05.640
 And again, even if it was already illegal,

2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:09.160
 and I've done plenty of survey research of people reporting,

2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:12.220
 they took mushrooms for fun or for personal exploration.

2:16:12.220 --> 2:16:14.800
 And they said, my God, why am I smoking?

2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:16.720
 And they quit smoking 20 years because of it,

2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:18.260
 or it's helped with their depression,

2:16:18.260 --> 2:16:20.300
 or it's helped with them overcoming alcoholism

2:16:20.300 --> 2:16:21.140
 or these different.

2:16:21.140 --> 2:16:22.920
 Sometimes that happens out of the blue

2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:24.600
 when people use psychedelics.

2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:27.680
 Nonetheless, obviously the efficacy rates

2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:29.220
 are going to be higher when you bring it

2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:31.820
 into these medical models and it's going to be safer.

2:16:31.820 --> 2:16:34.840
 So we need to be pushing that.

2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:38.260
 And my best guess is that MDMA is going to be approved

2:16:38.260 --> 2:16:39.820
 within the next three years.

2:16:39.820 --> 2:16:42.040
 And for prescription by a physician.

2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:46.160
 Yes, and not just take two and call me in the morning,

2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:47.200
 but in the clinics,

2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:50.080
 the way that those PTSD trials are being run.

2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:52.960
 So the MDMA would be approved for PTSD

2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:55.100
 and every disorder needs to be looked at separately.

2:16:55.100 --> 2:16:56.920
 And it's going to only be approved for those things.

2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:57.760
 Now, there's going to be questions about-

2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:00.760
 Right, because approved and legalized and regulated are,

2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:02.600
 you know, now we're getting into the nuance.

2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:04.400
 I think when people hear it's going to be approved

2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:07.540
 in two years, they think that they'll be able to buy

2:17:07.540 --> 2:17:10.000
 and sell and use MDMA without legal consequences.

2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.480
 And I do not think that's going to be the situation.

2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:13.480
 It's not the way it is.

2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:18.280
 And I will say that I think the quote unquote,

2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:20.120
 psychedelic community, I mean,

2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:21.840
 they've been doing what they want to

2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:25.840
 and will carry on doing what they want to anyway, right?

2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:29.160
 It's not like the legal status has prevented them

2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:30.800
 from doing what they're doing.

2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:35.800
 In fact, unlike Lee Erie and Timothy Leary and Huxley

2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:38.720
 and, you know, and some of the others that were very vocal

2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:41.020
 and lost their jobs and some of them even went to jail,

2:17:41.020 --> 2:17:41.920
 et cetera.

2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:43.980
 I mean, you've got a lot of public figures now

2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:46.000
 like McKenna and others who are just basically out there

2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000
 talking about psychedelics.

2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.140
 Michael Pollan, who is more of a writer,

2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:53.460
 foodie guy gone psychedelic dabbler, writer guy.

2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:55.920
 I know he's kind of a polymath,

2:17:55.920 --> 2:18:00.920
 but you know, the legal status didn't seem to hinder their,

2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:02.920
 at least online career.

2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:05.260
 So I don't know, I haven't looked at their bank accounts,

2:18:05.260 --> 2:18:08.040
 but I'm imagining they're doing just fine, right?

2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:10.840
 So the fact that the work is happening inside

2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:13.920
 of big institutions, I think it's important

2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:16.100
 that you point out, and I'm just trying to underscore

2:18:16.100 --> 2:18:19.900
 that that's in no way antagonistic

2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:20.880
 to what people are doing.

2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:23.800
 It's in support of a different sort of mission,

2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:26.800
 which is to explore the validity in different contexts

2:18:26.800 --> 2:18:28.920
 in a really controlled way,

2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:31.080
 which I really, you know,

2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:34.040
 I think it's a really important mission.

2:18:34.900 --> 2:18:36.400
 I want to make sure that I ask you

2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:38.480
 about the other really important mission

2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:40.540
 that you're involved in with respect to psychedelics,

2:18:40.540 --> 2:18:43.680
 which is not about depression per se,

2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:47.760
 but is about a neurologic injury or head injury.

2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:49.460
 I realize it's early days for this,

2:18:49.460 --> 2:18:54.220
 but I think there's a lot of concussion out there, sadly.

2:18:54.220 --> 2:18:57.000
 There's a lot of TBI, traumatic brain injury,

2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:58.060
 not just from sports.

2:18:58.060 --> 2:19:00.400
 I think people sometimes forget that it's not,

2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:04.280
 the major source of traumatic head injury is not football,

2:19:04.280 --> 2:19:07.000
 it's not hockey, it's not boxing,

2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:08.520
 it's not any of that stuff.

2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:10.920
 It's construction workers and it's people,

2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:12.180
 I mean, if you've ever seen the helmets

2:19:12.180 --> 2:19:14.040
 that construction workers wear, I mean-

2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:15.600
 The jackhammer, oh my God.

2:19:15.600 --> 2:19:17.240
 The jackhammer that- How could that not be just like-

2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:19.000
 Yeah, I have a colleague that works on this

2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:20.960
 in bioengineering and when you look at the,

2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.660
 you know, we always think sports,

2:19:22.660 --> 2:19:25.840
 but there are many people who make a living

2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:30.120
 in a way that is over time is detrimental to their brain

2:19:30.120 --> 2:19:31.320
 and they don't have the option

2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:33.980
 of just not being a professional athlete

2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:34.920
 or something of that sort.

2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:36.760
 And if they're not doing the construction,

2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:37.600
 someone else needs to do it.

2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:39.000
 Someone else has to do it, right.

2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.120
 And we forget, for some reason,

2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:43.320
 and I too, it didn't occur to me until I heard it,

2:19:43.320 --> 2:19:45.520
 like the people who are doing construction

2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:47.440
 and then of course with bike accidents

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:49.720
 and falls and things like that as well.

2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:50.560
 Military, you know?

2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:52.320
 Military, absolutely.

2:19:52.320 --> 2:19:57.320
 So what do you think is the potential for these compounds,

2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:01.040
 particularly psilocybin, but other compounds as well

2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:04.920
 for the treatment and possible even reversal

2:20:04.920 --> 2:20:08.560
 of neurological injuries and what sorts of things

2:20:08.560 --> 2:20:10.280
 are you excited to do in that realm?

2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:13.160
 Yeah, so this is definitely on the more exploratory end.

2:20:13.160 --> 2:20:15.560
 So it's based upon, so, you know,

2:20:15.560 --> 2:20:19.600
 this is sort of beyond the improvement

2:20:19.600 --> 2:20:23.080
 of psychiatric disorders like depression

2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:26.360
 or depression and anxiety associated

2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:30.600
 with a terminal illness or a substance use disorder,

2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:31.440
 the addiction.

2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:34.960
 So those are sort of psychiatric disorders.

2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:39.960
 So this is, you know, there are anecdotes of people saying

2:20:43.320 --> 2:20:47.320
 that psychedelics have helped heal their brain.

2:20:47.320 --> 2:20:49.560
 You know, they've been in one of these situations

2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:53.640
 like in sports, a sport where there's repetitive head impact

2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.000
 and they're claiming that using psychedelics

2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.800
 has actually improved their cognitive function,

2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:02.240
 for example, improved their memory,

2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:06.160
 including it improved their mood,

2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:09.440
 but it's kind of more of the cognitive function,

2:21:09.440 --> 2:21:11.920
 things like memory are...

2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:15.120
 Now, the caveat is if you've successfully improved

2:21:15.120 --> 2:21:15.960
 someone's depression,

2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.240
 you can get some cognitive improvement too,

2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:21.720
 but that's a more of a weaker, more indirect effect.

2:21:21.720 --> 2:21:24.760
 But if you take these anecdotes and you combine it

2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:28.520
 way across orders of analysis to the rodent research

2:21:28.520 --> 2:21:32.840
 from several labs like David Olson, Brian Roth,

2:21:32.840 --> 2:21:35.240
 these folks that have shown different forms

2:21:35.240 --> 2:21:38.160
 of neuroplasticity unfolding after,

2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:42.000
 like sort of post acutely.

2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.480
 So after in the days following the administration

2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:46.720
 of psychedelic compounds,

2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:48.680
 a variety of psychedelic compounds

2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:51.400
 and even some non psychedelic structural analogs

2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:56.800
 that you see these different forms of neuroplasticity.

2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:00.400
 So the growth of dendrites and new connections

2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:03.000
 being formed with different neurons.

2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:08.000
 So those effects may be at play

2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:11.600
 and they improve in the psychiatric treatments

2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:13.360
 that we're dealing with.

2:22:13.360 --> 2:22:15.680
 We don't know that, it seems like a decent guess,

2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:18.400
 and we're going to be figuring out whether that's the case.

2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:20.680
 But another potential that that sets up

2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:22.720
 is that maybe that's what's going on

2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:27.720
 with these claims of improvements

2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:31.080
 from neurological issues,

2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:36.080
 that there's actually a repair of the brain

2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:41.920
 from injuries underlying things that,

2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:44.200
 situations where there's repetitive head impact,

2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:47.280
 perhaps there's a potential for helping folks recover

2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:50.680
 from stroke and disorders like that.

2:22:50.680 --> 2:22:53.640
 There's a wide variety of disorders.

2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:56.720
 Now it's a bit of magic and a bit of like,

2:22:56.720 --> 2:22:58.680
 it's something that the enthusiasts

2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:00.480
 kind of can do some hand waving

2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:02.160
 and claim that this is already known.

2:23:02.160 --> 2:23:04.120
 It is more exploratory.

2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:07.600
 But what I'm hoping to do is some work with retired athletes

2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:12.640
 who have been exposed by the nature of their sport,

2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:15.680
 for example, NNA athletes in the UFC

2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:18.920
 who have been exposed to repetitive head impacts

2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:23.920
 like a lot of sports, a lot of sports expose people to,

2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:26.120
 and who are retired from the sport

2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:28.920
 and are suffering from say depression,

2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:32.880
 which can impart result from those types

2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:36.040
 of that history of head impact.

2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:39.440
 See if we can fix the depression,

2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:41.720
 but then also as a cherry on top

2:23:41.720 --> 2:23:44.080
 and a more exploratory aim,

2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:47.560
 see if we can have evidence of improvement

2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:50.760
 in cognitive function and associate like using MRI,

2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:53.120
 see if it affects gray matter over time,

2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:54.960
 these types of things to see if they're actually

2:23:54.960 --> 2:23:56.840
 some evidence of this improved,

2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:01.440
 like this more direct repair of the brain.

2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:04.040
 But again, it is very sort of like,

2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:05.320
 we've got some rodent data,

2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:07.120
 we've got some human anecdotes.

2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:11.000
 We will acknowledge it's early days

2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:13.800
 and we look forward to seeing the data.

2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:16.280
 I appreciate how cautious you are,

2:24:16.280 --> 2:24:19.000
 and tentative you are, you're not drawing any conclusions.

2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:23.400
 I think from a purely logical

2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:26.240
 and somewhat mechanistic perspective,

2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:29.720
 I mean, if we assume that lack of ability to focus

2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:34.720
 or degradation and mood is the reflection of neurons

2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:36.880
 in the brain, I think we can agree on that.

2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:39.560
 Some dialogue between neurons of the brain

2:24:39.560 --> 2:24:41.080
 and that what needs to be changed

2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:44.960
 is the nature of that dialogue, aka neuroplasticity.

2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:48.760
 We know that reordering of neural circuitry require,

2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:51.720
 in the adult, requires these things like intense focus

2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:53.000
 followed by rest, et cetera.

2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:56.840
 But the basis for that, like beneath focus is the mechanism,

2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:58.720
 is a mechanism rather,

2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:01.840
 beneath the bin that we call deep rest is a mechanism

2:25:01.840 --> 2:25:05.680
 and those mechanisms are neuromodulator driven.

2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:10.160
 So to me, I'm not reviewing your grant,

2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:13.360
 but from a rational perspective,

2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:17.640
 it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators,

2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:21.720
 like serotonin or dopamine in a controlled way,

2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:25.480
 and then coupling that with learning of some sort,

2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:27.120
 sensory input of some sort,

2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:31.000
 it makes sense that that would lead to,

2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.680
 could, I should say, lead to reordering of circuitry

2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:37.300
 that would allow for better thinking, better mood,

2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:40.000
 many of the same things that you've observed

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.520
 in the clinical trials for depression.

2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:44.760
 So the rationale is really strong.

2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:47.200
 I think that's a very exciting area.

2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:50.020
 I get asked all the time about TBI and traumatic brain injury

2:25:50.020 --> 2:25:52.940
 and right now, it's kind of,

2:25:54.580 --> 2:25:56.160
 there isn't a whole lot that people can do

2:25:56.160 --> 2:25:59.800
 and people are dabbling in the space of hyperbaric chambers

2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:02.400
 and people will do sauna and breath work

2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:05.180
 and people are kind of clipping at the margins

2:26:05.180 --> 2:26:08.240
 of what really is a problem that resides deep to the skull.

2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:11.960
 So I think I just want to applaud the exploration.

2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:13.920
 I think it's great provided that exploration

2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:15.240
 is being done in a controlled way.

2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:18.980
 It sounds like that's what you're doing with the UFC.

2:26:18.980 --> 2:26:22.560
 Yeah, so that's, they were really gracious

2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:25.140
 and had myself and a few of my colleagues

2:26:25.140 --> 2:26:26.840
 out to their headquarters in Vegas.

2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:28.000
 Impressive place, right?

2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:29.640
 It's in process.

2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:31.120
 There's a dialogue going on there.

2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:34.700
 I'm hopeful that there's going to be some work with them,

2:26:34.700 --> 2:26:37.520
 but it's in process now in terms of exploring it.

2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:40.720
 There's a real interest and I'm just really impressed

2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:43.880
 by the organization and their commitment to athlete health

2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:46.400
 and we'll see.

2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:47.240
 Yeah, I am too.

2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:51.220
 We have a colleague out there,

2:26:51.220 --> 2:26:53.120
 we're doing a little bit of work with them, Duncan French,

2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:55.020
 who's a serious academic in his own right.

2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:56.520
 And I think when people hear UFC,

2:26:56.520 --> 2:26:58.920
 they just think about the octagon and fighting

2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:00.580
 and pay-per-view fights and things,

2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:02.080
 but in talking with them,

2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:04.800
 and I'm sure you've had these discussions as well,

2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:06.720
 they are very much interested in the health

2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:08.920
 and longevity of their fighters.

2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:11.800
 They are also interested in the health and longevity

2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:13.260
 of their fighters being a template

2:27:13.260 --> 2:27:15.440
 for how to treat traumatic brain injury

2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:18.040
 and improve human performance in other sports

2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:19.680
 and in the general public.

2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:22.320
 And I think it's not an image of the UFC

2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:23.920
 that commonly comes to mind

2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:27.640
 because they haven't been particularly verbal

2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:28.520
 about it in the press,

2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:30.440
 but I think it's great they're bringing in academics.

2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:32.360
 I mean, geeks like us going out

2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:33.920
 to the UFC Performance Center.

2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:34.840
 I mean, you do MMA,

2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:37.400
 but I'm basically just a geek walking through the place.

2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:38.920
 But the fact that they're interested in talking

2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:40.320
 to scientists is really,

2:27:41.540 --> 2:27:42.380
 I'm biased here,

2:27:42.380 --> 2:27:43.720
 but a point in their favor.

2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:47.860
 Along the lines of other groups and individuals

2:27:47.860 --> 2:27:50.240
 that have impacted the space that you're working in

2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:53.060
 in this pioneering of the psychedelic space,

2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:55.240
 a few years ago,

2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:57.720
 I think if someone submitted a grant saying,

2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:02.720
 I want to study how psilocybin impacts human depression,

2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:06.480
 I'm guessing having worked on these panels before

2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:09.880
 that the response might've been closer to,

2:28:09.880 --> 2:28:12.020
 well, we need to do a lot of studies in rodents

2:28:12.020 --> 2:28:13.320
 and a lot of studies in primates.

2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:16.820
 And then maybe, just maybe we could explore these drugs

2:28:16.820 --> 2:28:18.560
 because the National Institutes of Health

2:28:18.560 --> 2:28:22.780
 actually has a whole institute devoted to addiction, right?

2:28:22.780 --> 2:28:24.440
 Of exploring compounds only

2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:26.700
 in terms of their negative effects, right?

2:28:26.700 --> 2:28:27.640
 Which is a very-

2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:29.960
 Which is where I've gotten all of my NIH funding.

2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:31.440
 Which is so interesting, right?

2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:33.280
 And it's a super important institute.

2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:34.120
 I want to be clear.

2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:35.600
 There are amazing people there.

2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:40.600
 But philanthropy and foundations have been very important

2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:43.160
 in supporting pioneering research.

2:28:44.040 --> 2:28:46.840
 And so maybe we just talk a little bit about that.

2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:51.120
 So your lab receives funding from taxpayer dollars

2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:53.320
 through the National Institutes of Health.

2:28:53.320 --> 2:28:56.160
 Is that mainly where your funding comes from?

2:28:56.160 --> 2:29:00.160
 So our group has gotten some funding

2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:03.560
 from like say the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA.

2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:06.840
 For some, a small subset of the psychedelic work,

2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:11.720
 but only for some work geared towards understanding

2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:13.240
 these things as drugs of abuse.

2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:14.520
 Of course, when you do a study though,

2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:15.360
 you can have-

2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:17.000
 Show us how they're, explore how they're bad.

2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.440
 Right, but when you're doing that,

2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:23.440
 you can explore like the good stuff too, you know?

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:27.280
 But the large majority of the work

2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:28.320
 and the most interesting work

2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:30.200
 has been funded by philanthropy.

2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:31.040
 Private philanthropy.

2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:35.080
 So I still have some grant support from NIDA

2:29:35.080 --> 2:29:36.320
 outside of psychedelics.

2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:41.200
 I'm shifting more and more of my time

2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:43.920
 towards focusing only on psychedelics.

2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:47.920
 And in fact, us getting the center level funding

2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:51.720
 from some really big picture philanthropists

2:29:51.720 --> 2:29:54.840
 like helped me to start to make that transition.

2:29:54.840 --> 2:29:57.480
 But groups like the Hefta Research Organization,

2:29:57.480 --> 2:29:59.880
 Dennis McKenna, which is one of the founding members,

2:29:59.880 --> 2:30:01.240
 brother of Terrence McKenna,

2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:02.880
 who's by the way, an ethnobotanist,

2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:03.720
 that's what his PhD is in.

2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:05.240
 What does that mean, ethnobotanist?

2:30:05.240 --> 2:30:08.360
 Studying the, essentially the anthropology

2:30:08.360 --> 2:30:11.880
 of psychoactive plant use.

2:30:11.880 --> 2:30:12.720
 So-

2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:13.760
 You can get a degree in that?

2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:15.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:17.160
 You know, hanging out with cultures

2:30:17.160 --> 2:30:19.240
 and studying their use of these compounds

2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:20.320
 in the traditional ways.

2:30:20.320 --> 2:30:22.040
 At Hopkins?

2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:24.120
 There's, that degree exists at Johns Hopkins?

2:30:24.120 --> 2:30:26.440
 I don't think that degree exists at Hopkins,

2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:28.680
 but I mean, the kind of the most,

2:30:28.680 --> 2:30:31.800
 and you know, as you'll, as you know from academia,

2:30:31.800 --> 2:30:34.200
 I'm not, you know, sometimes folks,

2:30:34.200 --> 2:30:35.720
 I'm not sure how many people's PhD

2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:38.600
 is actually in ethnobotany

2:30:38.600 --> 2:30:40.600
 or is actually in something else.

2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:42.160
 But the real focus is like,

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:45.120
 my degree is general experimental psychology.

2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:46.960
 10,000 kids out there just decided

2:30:46.960 --> 2:30:48.800
 they're going to major in ethnobotany.

2:30:48.800 --> 2:30:49.640
 But you know the-

2:30:49.640 --> 2:30:52.320
 I mean, one of the pioneers of the psychedelic area

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:53.920
 before Leary and before,

2:30:53.920 --> 2:30:56.440
 and actually he was late even for the human researchers,

2:30:56.440 --> 2:30:59.080
 like folks like Humphrey Osmond and Abraham Hoffer

2:30:59.080 --> 2:31:00.560
 and Sidney Cohen were earlier.

2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:02.720
 But even before those folks,

2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:04.160
 Richard Schultes at Harvard,

2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:06.640
 he was, I mentioned him earlier in the conversation,

2:31:06.640 --> 2:31:08.440
 discovered all of this,

2:31:08.440 --> 2:31:12.360
 these various tribes using ayahuasca or yage,

2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:14.560
 a different name for the same thing,

2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:16.040
 throughout South America

2:31:16.040 --> 2:31:19.080
 and these DMT containing snuffs and all of this.

2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:22.160
 So, you know, that was, you know, ethnobotany,

2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:25.480
 this kind of intersection of anthropology

2:31:25.480 --> 2:31:29.280
 and these psychoactive plant compounds.

2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:31.920
 So the Hefta Research Institute,

2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:36.800
 which Dennis is a founding and active member of,

2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:38.800
 a board member,

2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:41.160
 they have funded a lot of our early work.

2:31:41.160 --> 2:31:46.160
 There's also an organization called the Beckley Institute

2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:50.120
 based in England that Lady Amanda Fielding

2:31:50.120 --> 2:31:52.320
 has been the head of that has,

2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:56.520
 they provided the first funding for our psilocybin

2:31:56.520 --> 2:31:59.280
 smoking cessation research and the Hefta came in

2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:00.920
 and provided subsequent funding.

2:32:00.920 --> 2:32:03.080
 But it's, and then there are other groups,

2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:04.960
 a Council on Spiritual Practices,

2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:07.720
 a great guy named Bob Jesse,

2:32:07.720 --> 2:32:09.600
 funded some of the original work at Hopkins,

2:32:09.600 --> 2:32:11.320
 looking at the nature of mystical experience

2:32:11.320 --> 2:32:14.760
 outside of treating disease states or disorders,

2:32:14.760 --> 2:32:16.600
 but just understanding these,

2:32:16.600 --> 2:32:19.320
 like people take these compounds

2:32:19.320 --> 2:32:22.600
 and astonishingly, you know, frequently,

2:32:22.600 --> 2:32:24.160
 we'll say that was the most important

2:32:24.160 --> 2:32:25.480
 everything I've ever experienced.

2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:27.000
 It's like, what the hell is that?

2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:28.880
 Yeah, I had someone mention recently,

2:32:28.880 --> 2:32:30.680
 I think this might surprise people a little bit,

2:32:30.680 --> 2:32:31.520
 certainly surprised me.

2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:35.280
 I had a friend who adores his children.

2:32:35.280 --> 2:32:36.280
 He's got three children.

2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:38.440
 He adores his children.

2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:40.960
 Happy marriage and great, great father.

2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:41.960
 They're both great parents.

2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:45.800
 And he told me that as part of a clinical trial,

2:32:45.800 --> 2:32:48.600
 he had a DMT experience,

2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:50.160
 that he claims, he said,

2:32:50.160 --> 2:32:52.960
 I'd love to tell you that the birth of my children

2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:55.880
 was as profound, but that was a more profound experience

2:32:55.880 --> 2:32:57.600
 than the birth of my children.

2:32:57.600 --> 2:32:59.920
 Any one of them and all of them combined.

2:32:59.920 --> 2:33:01.520
 And I was like, wow, now I've never done DMT,

2:33:01.520 --> 2:33:03.320
 but I was like, wow, that's a pretty strong statement.

2:33:03.320 --> 2:33:05.280
 Now he did it in the context of one of these,

2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:07.040
 you know, clinical explorations.

2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:10.200
 I assume that was part of a legal clinical trial,

2:33:10.200 --> 2:33:13.240
 but the, I mean, that's saying something.

2:33:13.240 --> 2:33:14.280
 It's saying something.

2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:19.280
 I mean, he's a very rational, very grounded guy, otherwise.

2:33:19.400 --> 2:33:23.760
 But so philanthropy, foundations, and then-

2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:25.840
 Most recently, and so I just, I can't,

2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:26.880
 cause I can't skip it.

2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:27.720
 Our center level funding-

2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:28.560
 Oh yeah, you can't skip magic.

2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:29.520
 Which changed a year and a half.

2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:30.360
 I see.

2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:33.240
 That's like, we, I mean, the Hefner group,

2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:35.640
 the Beckley group, I mean, these are wonderful.

2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:37.000
 I mean, these are people that have been holding

2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:39.640
 the flame alive during the darkest hours, like the,

2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:42.160
 same thing with MD, with the MAPS organization

2:33:42.160 --> 2:33:43.400
 more on the MDMA side,

2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:46.440
 like holding that candle during the darkest years.

2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:48.280
 That, you know, so we've, but, you know,

2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:51.520
 smaller organizations connected to smaller,

2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:54.560
 but growing over time, you know, pockets of wealth.

2:33:55.480 --> 2:33:57.360
 But, you know, we basically limped on,

2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:00.600
 limped along on a wing and a prayer until recently,

2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:03.120
 when we got the $17 million gift

2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:04.760
 so that we could create a nominal center.

2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:06.680
 And as you know, basically to the university,

2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:08.560
 that means you get a certain number of dollars,

2:34:08.560 --> 2:34:10.840
 and a lot of them, you can call yourself a center.

2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:13.960
 You know, it's a capital investment, you know,

2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:17.800
 staff, you know, equipment, salary support,

2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:20.640
 which has always been the huge thing for us.

2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:22.640
 But the $17 million gift,

2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:26.440
 which was split between the Cohen Foundation,

2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:29.320
 so Steven and Alexandra Cohen,

2:34:29.320 --> 2:34:30.160
 they covered half of it.

2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:32.920
 And the other half, the Tim Ferriss collaborative,

2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:35.840
 basically Tim and a few friends,

2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:37.920
 ponied up that the, you know,

2:34:37.920 --> 2:34:41.800
 divided the rest of that half of that $17 million gift

2:34:41.800 --> 2:34:44.320
 and came together to just, I mean,

2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:46.880
 it just, it's completely transformed our,

2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:49.520
 the work that we've done and our ability to,

2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:54.520
 like to fully delve into this area and not worry that like,

2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.480
 oh, if I focus on this,

2:34:56.480 --> 2:34:59.040
 rather than putting another three NIDA grants

2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:02.080
 on some other topic that may or may not get funded,

2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:04.320
 like if I focus too much on the psychedelics,

2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:06.040
 am I putting my career at jeopardy?

2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:06.880
 But like, so-

2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:08.560
 So you're now not only a tenured professor,

2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:11.120
 you're also a full endowed-

2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:11.960
 Right, so that came-

2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:13.200
 By the way, when you say somebody

2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:15.120
 is a fully endowed professor,

2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:16.320
 I want to be very clear what that means.

2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:17.160
 That means that there's funding-

2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:18.480
 Well, it might mean all of the above,

2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:20.360
 but no, I'm just kidding.

2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:23.280
 I have no knowledge of your particular situation,

2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:26.040
 but you probably do.

2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:26.880
 Just kidding.

2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:31.880
 But sure, what we're essentially saying is that funding,

2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:35.600
 which does not change somebody's salary level,

2:35:35.600 --> 2:35:36.440
 I just want to be clear,

2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:38.400
 because I think the general public isn't,

2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:40.400
 there's no reason why they would understand

2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:42.120
 all the nuts and bolts of how this works.

2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:42.960
 Academia is weird.

2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:43.960
 Yeah, academia is weird

2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:46.520
 because we're not talking about increasing,

2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:47.960
 we're not talking about an endowment

2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:52.160
 or philanthropy that went to increase Matt's salary.

2:35:52.160 --> 2:35:55.600
 That's something that's set at the university level.

2:35:55.600 --> 2:35:56.440
 It's always been said,

2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:59.600
 and it at least is still true now,

2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:02.040
 which is that nobody goes into science for the money,

2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:04.280
 at least not at the academic level.

2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:07.160
 Not in academia,

2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:11.960
 but allows people to devote more of their time and energy

2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:16.960
 to these exploratory realms like psychedelic research

2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:18.720
 or in the case of my lab,

2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:20.640
 the work that we're doing with David Spiegel's lab

2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:22.240
 on respiration, breath work,

2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:24.680
 and hypnosis for modulating brain states.

2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:26.400
 These are not typically areas

2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:27.800
 that the National Institutes of Health

2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:29.040
 and other major organizations

2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:32.920
 have institutions set up to support.

2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:35.400
 Now there is an exciting initiative,

2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:38.560
 which is the NCCIH, which is Complementary Health.

2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:39.400
 Right.

2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:40.520
 Used to be NCCAM.

2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:41.360
 Yeah.

2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:42.200
 At NIH.

2:36:42.200 --> 2:36:44.200
 And now we're not just throwing out acronyms

2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:46.440
 just to bat back and forth acronyms,

2:36:46.440 --> 2:36:48.760
 but I think what we're seeing now

2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:54.760
 is a movement toward science and scientists and clinicians

2:36:55.600 --> 2:36:58.440
 and the general public and philanthropy

2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:01.040
 being engaged in this dialogue,

2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:04.160
 which says, okay, there are problems in the world,

2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:09.160
 depression, head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD.

2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:12.720
 These problems clearly exist.

2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:15.360
 The solutions are going to involve behaviors

2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:17.160
 that are going to involve nutrition,

2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:19.080
 supplementation, social connection.

2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:21.240
 However, there are drugs,

2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:23.440
 there are compounds that can change the brain

2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:26.160
 and allow the brain to change its circuitry

2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:27.000
 through experience

2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:31.160
 and psychedelics are one of several others,

2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:34.680
 but one of the powerful levers, it sounds like.

2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:38.000
 And I just want to say that I think

2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:39.400
 the reason I reached out to you

2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:41.880
 and I'm so excited to sit down and chat with you

2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:46.840
 is because I see very few people

2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:49.240
 inside the halls of academia

2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:51.160
 who have thrown their arms

2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:54.440
 around this issue of psychedelics in a way

2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:55.480
 and gone through the trouble

2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:57.800
 of trying to find the funding to get it done,

2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:01.320
 gone through the trouble of trying to set up clinical trials.

2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:02.720
 I know what's involved in doing this.

2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:03.960
 It's so complicated.

2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:06.880
 It's so time-consuming and painstaking

2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:08.560
 and you've made real progress.

2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:10.600
 I mean, you guys are publishing papers.

2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:12.760
 There's a new dialogue emerging

2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:14.400
 that isn't just books on bookshelves

2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:19.400
 and psychonaut gurus on the internet

2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:21.160
 who also play an important role,

2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:24.360
 but you're really moving this field forward.

2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:25.880
 And I know there are others as well.

2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:28.280
 There are colleagues in England and others as well.

2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:32.000
 We acknowledge them, but I just want to say personally

2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:35.120
 that I'm inspired and impressed

2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:37.480
 by the way that you've gone about this

2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:38.960
 and the level of rigor.

2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:41.640
 I mean, when I ask you a question about serotonin,

2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:43.360
 most people will just kind of kick back to me.

2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:45.280
 Well, yeah, you got receptors and you got a ligand,

2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:49.880
 but I mean, it's clear to me that you care about the details

2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:53.000
 and that you care about the future of this area

2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.480
 and you also really care about these patients

2:38:55.480 --> 2:38:56.440
 and these individuals.

2:38:56.440 --> 2:39:00.280
 So I know I'm speaking on behalf of a ton of people now

2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:02.800
 and in the future that don't even know

2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:05.240
 what they're going to receive as a consequence of this.

2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:10.240
 I just want to voice a real sincere thank you

2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:11.400
 for that effort.

2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:13.960
 It's like your lab and your work matters

2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:17.960
 and that's a really special and unique thing.

2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:19.120
 I appreciate that.

2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:21.160
 I had a good colleague, in fact,

2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:24.200
 shared some grant support under the multi-PI system

2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:28.720
 years ago and she actually took a job at NIH

2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:32.760
 as a review officer and I remember her telling me,

2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:34.880
 and she actually left when she had multiple RO1s,

2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:35.720
 so it's like she didn't move to it.

2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:38.560
 The RO1s are kind of the bread and butter,

2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:43.400
 big grants that every card carrying,

2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:45.160
 it's a mark of respect in our community

2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:47.360
 to have one or several of these, yeah.

2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:51.000
 Yeah, yeah, and it's like you eat what you kill in academia,

2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:52.200
 it gets to what we're talking about later.

2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:54.720
 It's like you don't make more money by pulling more grants,

2:39:54.720 --> 2:39:57.160
 but you're able to pay the salary that,

2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:01.080
 like the university doesn't pay you your salary,

2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:02.800
 it goes through them.

2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:04.280
 You're just able to do more work.

2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:06.240
 Yeah, and you're able to,

2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:08.640
 and if you don't pull in the grants to cover your salary,

2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:09.840
 your job can come to an end.

2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:12.840
 Even if you're tenured at a place like Hopkins,

2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:15.920
 they can do tricks like slowly lower your salary over these.

2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:19.360
 Or they just take away your space.

2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:22.200
 Yeah, they put you in a closet and give you no support

2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:25.160
 for trainees and basically make life hell for you.

2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:27.320
 So you can drive a cab in Baltimore

2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:29.560
 and call yourself a full professor at Hopkins,

2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:32.160
 truthfully, but you may have no ability

2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:34.000
 to get anything done.

2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:35.920
 But yeah, I remember one of the things

2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:38.280
 this colleague said, who is successful,

2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:39.880
 but left on top said,

2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:41.720
 I really don't know that I'm making a difference

2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:44.920
 in the world, and she did some great memory research

2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:48.480
 and connected to drugs, also connected to aging,

2:40:48.480 --> 2:40:52.720
 but she said, I don't feel the impact

2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:54.400
 of what I'm doing in the real world.

2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:57.080
 And it's unfortunately there for a lot of academia.

2:40:57.080 --> 2:40:59.360
 What we do, it stays in the ivory tower.

2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:03.480
 The world is a beautiful but messed up place,

2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:05.360
 and a lot of this doesn't disseminate

2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:08.520
 and because of the various structures,

2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:09.760
 the way the world is set up,

2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:14.760
 and thankfully, because the work that our group,

2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:18.600
 as well as a few others around the world

2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:20.440
 over the last 20 years,

2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:23.520
 you do have an emerging psychedelic startup industry

2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:25.040
 now with billions of dollars of investment.

2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:28.640
 And yeah, that's gonna turn into both good and bad,

2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:30.560
 like it's upping the ante.

2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:32.040
 There's gonna be a lot of good and bad

2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:32.920
 that comes from that,

2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:35.720
 but any new technology is gonna result in that.

2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:38.360
 But we've got psilocybin designated

2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:41.480
 for two separate entities as a breakthrough therapy

2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:43.680
 by the FDA, and people may not realize,

2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:48.520
 and MDMA is designated as a breakthrough therapy for PTSD.

2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:49.960
 This is a really big deal.

2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:51.920
 That's a very high, I mean,

2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:56.280
 pharma companies would pay millions of dollars

2:41:56.280 --> 2:41:59.520
 to get their new drug a designation like that.

2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:02.120
 And what it means is early research is showing,

2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:05.040
 saying it shows a high potential for treating disorders

2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:07.200
 that don't have very good treatments.

2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:10.120
 So we're, and we're probably,

2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:12.200
 again, a few years away from both MDMA

2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:14.080
 and probably a year or two after that psilocybin

2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:18.440
 being treated for PTSD and depression respectively.

2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:19.280
 This is, you know,

2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:20.840
 we have to wait for the phase three studies,

2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:22.960
 but if the results hold up,

2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:25.320
 even if the effect size is like halved

2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:26.920
 of what we're seeing now,

2:42:26.920 --> 2:42:28.880
 it's still gonna be a lot larger

2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:31.160
 than what you're seeing with the traditional medications.

2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:33.760
 And so it's gonna be approved if the data hold up,

2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:36.120
 and it probably will from my judgment.

2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:39.200
 So I feel like what I'm doing

2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:41.680
 is actually having a positive impact

2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:43.120
 in the world in a way that,

2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:46.000
 and I feel lucky that I got interested in an area

2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.760
 that happens to plug into a place in the world

2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:51.440
 where there is that opportunity,

2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:53.800
 where some great colleagues and friends

2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:58.200
 are focused on areas where I wish they had the opportunity

2:42:58.200 --> 2:42:59.680
 for their work to be disseminated.

2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:00.520
 I wish that, I mean,

2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:03.400
 I was lucky to be interviewed on 60 Minutes

2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:04.400
 because of this work.

2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:05.960
 And I was like, oh my God, I know so many,

2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:09.040
 there's a bit of a, you know, imposter syndrome.

2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:11.520
 Like, oh my God, I know so many scientists

2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:14.360
 that deserve, you know, more so than me

2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:18.040
 to have that level of exposure.

2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:20.000
 But if you happen to be in that place

2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:24.920
 where you gotta do your best to make it work,

2:43:24.920 --> 2:43:26.520
 to take advantage of that luck

2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:29.400
 and that intersection of the world and to push it.

2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:30.680
 And, you know, I've been lucky,

2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:33.920
 but also did take a bit of a leap of faith early on.

2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:37.360
 I did have some advisors that told me like,

2:43:37.360 --> 2:43:39.720
 you've got a really promising pedigree early on.

2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:41.680
 Like, are you sure you want to focus

2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:43.360
 much time on this psychedelic stuff?

2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:44.920
 You've embraced risk.

2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:46.440
 I mean, I think that, I mean,

2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:50.080
 the world's changed since in 2020, certainly,

2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:53.800
 but, you know, channels like social media, podcasts

2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:55.200
 and things of that sort, you know,

2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:58.080
 your exposure is because people are interested

2:43:58.080 --> 2:43:59.080
 in these topics.

2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:00.760
 And that's why people like myself

2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:03.160
 are interested in talking to you.

2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:05.320
 I mean, you know, at Stanford,

2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:08.360
 there are now a few labs starting to explore psychedelics

2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:09.920
 more at the mechanistic level,

2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:13.480
 but so in animal models, excellent labs,

2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:16.080
 but also I can imagine,

2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:17.600
 and because of the pioneering work

2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:18.560
 that you've done at Hopkins,

2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:20.880
 it'll start to become more common.

2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:22.840
 I'm certain that people are going to have questions

2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:26.000
 about how to get in contact with you and learn more.

2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:30.840
 If people have trauma, PTSD, depression,

2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:34.200
 you know, it's likely that they're going to start

2:44:34.200 --> 2:44:36.760
 seeking ways in which they can potentially

2:44:36.760 --> 2:44:39.160
 participate in clinical trials.

2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:42.240
 You're very active on Twitter, active, I should say,

2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:43.320
 you've got other obligations,

2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:45.080
 but where you are active on social media,

2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:46.000
 you're active on Twitter.

2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:50.320
 It's drug, it's at drug downscore researcher.

2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:51.160
 Correct?

2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:52.000
 Yeah.

2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:52.820
 Okay.

2:44:52.820 --> 2:44:54.600
 Drug underscore researcher.

2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:55.920
 That's how to find me.

2:44:55.920 --> 2:44:57.240
 Great account, by the way.

2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:01.040
 Matthew and I recently got into a dialogue there

2:45:01.040 --> 2:45:03.360
 about some of the deeper effects of psychedelics

2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:05.760
 in the literature versus how they're being discussed

2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:08.480
 in the general public, and I follow his account,

2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:09.840
 and it's a really wonderful account

2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:13.740
 for whether or not you have a science background or not.

2:45:13.740 --> 2:45:16.400
 If people are, and I'm going to try and persuade you

2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:17.960
 to be more active on Instagram,

2:45:17.960 --> 2:45:19.400
 but I don't know if I'll succeed in that.

2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:20.240
 I'll try to get my Instagram name going on.

2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:22.060
 You're a busy guy, and I get it.

2:45:22.060 --> 2:45:23.760
 I'm running a lab too, I get it, you're busy,

2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.720
 but drug downscore researcher there as well.

2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:29.080
 Same handle.

2:45:29.080 --> 2:45:30.680
 Same handle.

2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:33.160
 Your lab at Hopkins is pretty straightforward

2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:35.260
 to find through a Google search of your name,

2:45:35.260 --> 2:45:37.720
 Matthew Johnson, Johns Hopkins University.

2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:42.720
 Are there portals for people to explore clinical trials,

2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:45.080
 participation in clinical trials of various kinds?

2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:46.800
 Yeah, and so in our group,

2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:50.280
 so you go to hopkinspsychedelic.org.

2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:52.760
 That's the website, and if you can't remember that,

2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:54.680
 just Johns Hopkins Psychedelic.

2:45:54.680 --> 2:45:55.520
 Yeah, we will provide it.

2:45:55.520 --> 2:45:57.400
 Yeah, and you're going to find us.

2:45:57.400 --> 2:46:00.520
 It'll be the first thing that pops up, and we have,

2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:03.200
 trust me, if we have a study on something,

2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:04.800
 it's going to be on that website.

2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:07.280
 That means they're being very polite,

2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:09.460
 so I will be a little bit more aggressive and say,

2:46:09.460 --> 2:46:11.040
 don't email him directly.

2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:12.500
 He won't see that email.

2:46:12.500 --> 2:46:14.560
 Wait until there's a posting for a study,

2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:16.400
 and then sign up through the correct portal.

2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:18.280
 And I try to get back to those emails,

2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:21.640
 but frankly, and it's because, you know,

2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:23.680
 I'm lucky the area has taken off so much,

2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:27.080
 but there are many days where I simply get so many requests

2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:28.920
 that I can't get through my day.

2:46:28.920 --> 2:46:32.440
 Yeah, if I answer all the, so yeah, trust me.

2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:34.240
 And something that a lot of folks don't get

2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:35.880
 and being in academia like we are,

2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:38.020
 it's easy to forget how people don't,

2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:40.240
 understandably don't realize this.

2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:42.400
 This is experimental research.

2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:45.560
 It's FDA approved as an experiment, you know,

2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:47.920
 so we're working towards formal FDA approval

2:46:47.920 --> 2:46:49.060
 for straight up clinical use.

2:46:49.060 --> 2:46:51.480
 But right now, someone can't bring me a case

2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:56.160
 of some idiosyncratic thing and say,

2:46:56.160 --> 2:46:58.200
 I'm suffering from this complex constellation

2:46:58.200 --> 2:46:59.160
 of depression. You're not a clinician.

2:46:59.160 --> 2:47:02.120
 And yeah, I'm not a clinician, and even if I was,

2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:05.180
 I wouldn't be able to treat them with psilocybin

2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:10.180
 or to send them anywhere that was legal to take it.

2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:14.160
 You know, so if we're going to be treating you,

2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:17.160
 it has to be, or anyone else in the United States

2:47:17.160 --> 2:47:19.280
 or most other countries for that matter,

2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:20.720
 it's going to have to be under the guise

2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:22.680
 of a very specific protocol.

2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:26.240
 This number of milligrams to treat PTSD,

2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:28.080
 to treat major depressive disorder,

2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:32.960
 to treat treatment resistant tobacco use disorder,

2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:36.440
 so nicotine addiction, very specific studies.

2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:38.520
 This is not one-off treatment.

2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:41.760
 And folks say like, oh, I can pay to go out to Baltimore.

2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:45.040
 If you see my, oh, my son has this, you know, complex,

2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:47.880
 like in their tragic cases, but you,

2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:50.660
 so if you're interested in a study, go to our website.

2:47:50.660 --> 2:47:53.100
 If it's not on their website, you know,

2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:54.480
 we don't have a study on it.

2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:56.000
 There are going to be forthcoming studies,

2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.840
 so I'm going to be starting studies on opioid addiction

2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:02.080
 and PTSD and an LSD study for chronic pain.

2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:05.560
 The day that those are open for recruitment,

2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:06.920
 they're going to be up on our website.

2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:09.200
 So that's where you look to see everything.

2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:11.220
 And in fact, I would just recently, a couple of days ago,

2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:12.520
 put up a couple of survey studies,

2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:15.360
 also where we post links to our survey studies.

2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:18.160
 So if you've had psychedelics and you've taken them

2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:21.680
 for therapeutic intent for PTSD or for depression

2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:23.560
 or anxiety, you can find a link.

2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:25.720
 And also if you've done breath work for those reasons,

2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:28.540
 we have a link for a study of that type up there now,

2:48:28.540 --> 2:48:30.480
 which is a holotropic style breath,

2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:33.860
 very psychedelic type of breathing technique

2:48:33.860 --> 2:48:37.160
 that can lead to some of these similar experiences.

2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:38.000
 So it's up there.

2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.480
 More broadly outside of our group,

2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:43.080
 because there's a growing number of groups in the US

2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:45.540
 doing this and in Europe doing this research,

2:48:45.540 --> 2:48:49.280
 but you can go to clinicaltrials.gov.

2:48:49.280 --> 2:48:54.280
 And if you look in for the main search term of psilocybin

2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:58.080
 or MDMA or psychedelic plugin, those terms,

2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:00.160
 you can get a list of the growing number.

2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:04.600
 I mean, I think there's over 40, maybe it's been a while.

2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:06.120
 There might be over 50 now, I don't know,

2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:09.400
 but studies with just psilocybin going on right now

2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:10.920
 on clinicaltrials.gov.

2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:13.840
 So check out clinicaltrials.gov to see what's going on,

2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:17.480
 but it's going to be, if you're going to do anything legal,

2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:20.320
 it's going to be in the context of a very specific study.

2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:22.600
 It's not going to be one-off treatment.

2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:25.200
 Right, and I should say just, and not just legal,

2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:28.960
 but also supported in the right framework

2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:32.100
 that you described of having a team, et cetera.

2:49:32.100 --> 2:49:34.640
 Obviously people will do what they will do.

2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:38.480
 Oh yeah, go ahead.

2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:39.360
 I will say, if people,

2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:41.640
 I never encourage people to take drugs of any,

2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:42.960
 I don't encourage caffeine use.

2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:44.680
 Every drug has its risk.

2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:47.800
 I encourage my own caffeine use, but nobody else's.

2:49:47.800 --> 2:49:48.960
 I'm drinking up right now.

2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:49.800
 This is great.

2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:52.160
 Yeah, this is a very strong mate is what we're drinking.

2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:56.560
 It does not lead to a alteration in my perception of self

2:49:56.560 --> 2:49:58.360
 to the extent that we talked about earlier.

2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:02.000
 However, this conversation wasn't a good example

2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:03.960
 of how we can enter a perceptual bubble.

2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:07.160
 I learned so much about psychedelics

2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:10.340
 and the future of this for sake of mental health

2:50:10.340 --> 2:50:12.040
 and other aspects of health.

2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:16.660
 Matt, thank you so much for your time, for your knowledge.

2:50:16.660 --> 2:50:18.920
 And I think you put it best earlier

2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.040
 for holding the candle in a very dark time.

2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:24.720
 And then now there's light.

2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:25.680
 Thank you.

2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:27.240
 Well, thanks for helping to spread that light.

2:50:27.240 --> 2:50:30.280
 And I really appreciate what you've been doing.

2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:33.280
 This is a great, great medium that you have going on.

2:50:33.280 --> 2:50:35.400
 So thank you for doing it.

2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:36.700
 It's my pleasure.

2:50:36.700 --> 2:50:37.540
 Thank you.

2:50:37.540 --> 2:50:39.500
 Thank you for joining me for my conversation

2:50:39.500 --> 2:50:41.520
