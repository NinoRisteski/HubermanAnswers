00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.140
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.960
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.960 --> 00:14.920
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.040
 Today, we are talking about time perception.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.920
 Our perception of time is perhaps the most important factor

00:21.920 --> 00:24.040
 in how we gauge our life.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.960
 That is, whether or not we think we are being successful,

00:26.960 --> 00:28.500
 whether or not we are failing,

00:28.500 --> 00:30.280
 whether or not we live in fear,

00:30.280 --> 00:32.440
 whether or not we live in relation to things

00:32.440 --> 00:33.680
 in a way that's positive.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.040
 And the reason for that is that our perception of time

00:37.040 --> 00:39.840
 is directly linked to the neurochemical states

00:39.840 --> 00:44.040
 that control mood, stress, happiness, excitement,

00:44.040 --> 00:46.080
 and of course, it frames the way

00:46.080 --> 00:48.680
 in which we evaluate our past.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.640
 So whether or not we think of our past

00:50.640 --> 00:54.640
 as successful or unsuccessful, it frames our present,

00:54.640 --> 00:57.380
 whether or not we think we are on track or off track,

00:57.380 --> 00:59.840
 and it frames our sense of the future,

00:59.840 --> 01:02.480
 whether or not we think we have a bright future,

01:02.480 --> 01:04.520
 a dim future, or whether or not the future

01:04.520 --> 01:07.240
 is very uncertain or not.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.260
 Today, we are going to talk about

01:08.260 --> 01:10.260
 the science of time perception,

01:10.260 --> 01:13.200
 and we are going to talk about tools and protocols

01:13.200 --> 01:17.000
 that you can use that can enhance your ability

01:17.000 --> 01:19.020
 to dilate and contract time.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.920
 What do we mean by dilate and contract time?

01:21.920 --> 01:25.460
 We can control the speed at which we experience life.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.140
 We can slow things down or we can speed

01:28.140 --> 01:29.880
 our experience of life up,

01:29.880 --> 01:32.960
 and we can do that in a very direct and dynamic way.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.440
 It's actually not that hard

01:34.440 --> 01:36.640
 once you understand how time perception works.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.520
 So that's where we're headed.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.680
 I think you're going to come away from today's episode

01:39.680 --> 01:43.620
 with a lot of new knowledge and certainly with many tools

01:43.620 --> 01:45.300
 that you can try in your daily life,

01:45.300 --> 01:47.440
 whether or not that's work, sport, relational,

01:47.440 --> 01:49.400
 emotional, and so on.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.400
 Before we begin our discussion about time perception,

01:52.400 --> 01:54.960
 I'd like to answer some questions that I received

01:54.960 --> 01:57.040
 related to the episode on fasting

01:57.040 --> 01:58.840
 and time-restricted feeding.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.080
 If you haven't seen that episode,

02:00.080 --> 02:02.840
 this information should still be of use to you.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.000
 Time-restricted feeding involves eating

02:05.000 --> 02:08.120
 for a particular period of time in each 24-hour cycle

02:08.120 --> 02:09.700
 that's fairly regular.

02:09.700 --> 02:12.180
 So this would be an eight-hour most often

02:12.180 --> 02:13.260
 or a 10-hour block.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.940
 Some people do shorter feeding windows,

02:15.940 --> 02:18.040
 but regardless, that feeding window is supposed to fall

02:18.040 --> 02:20.800
 at more or less the same period within each 24-hour day.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.800
 This has a number of positive effects on gene expression

02:23.800 --> 02:25.480
 that regulate a number of positive effects

02:25.480 --> 02:27.000
 on the different tissues of the body.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.840
 And for some people, not all,

02:28.840 --> 02:31.920
 but for some people makes weight loss easier

02:31.920 --> 02:34.040
 because of the way that they are not eating

02:34.040 --> 02:36.800
 for large periods of each 24-hour cycle.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.460
 In any event, one of the major questions I got

02:39.460 --> 02:44.000
 after that episode was do supplements break a fast?

02:44.000 --> 02:44.920
 And during that episode,

02:44.920 --> 02:48.260
 I talked about what breaks a fast is highly contextual.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.560
 It basically boils down to whether or not

02:50.560 --> 02:54.540
 something you ingest, whether it be liquid or food,

02:54.540 --> 02:56.460
 increases your resting blood glucose,

02:56.460 --> 02:58.980
 how much it increases that resting blood glucose,

02:58.980 --> 03:01.760
 and how long that increase lasts.

03:01.760 --> 03:02.960
 So you can check out the episode

03:02.960 --> 03:05.460
 for more about what breaks a fast,

03:05.460 --> 03:08.180
 but to address this issue about supplements

03:08.180 --> 03:10.920
 and whether or not supplements a particular break a fast,

03:10.920 --> 03:13.560
 many of the questions were about Athletic Greens.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.480
 Athletic Greens is a sponsor of this podcast.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.040
 It is also a terrific supplement that I had been taking

03:19.040 --> 03:21.960
 for more than a decade before this podcast launched.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.320
 And many people have been using

03:24.320 --> 03:26.840
 and continue to use Athletic Greens.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.920
 Does Athletic Greens break a fast?

03:28.920 --> 03:31.040
 Well, that will somewhat depend on whether or not

03:31.040 --> 03:34.240
 your resting blood glucose tends to run high or low.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.920
 But for most people, including me,

03:35.920 --> 03:37.120
 because I've measured it,

03:37.120 --> 03:39.580
 ingesting Athletic Greens does not break a fast.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.180
 And if it happens to break a fast,

03:41.180 --> 03:43.800
 it would be a very transient break in fast.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.540
 So without knowing your resting blood glucose levels

03:46.540 --> 03:47.620
 on an individual basis,

03:47.620 --> 03:49.040
 there's no way I can say for sure

03:49.040 --> 03:50.140
 that it doesn't break a fast,

03:50.140 --> 03:51.880
 but chances are it does not

03:51.880 --> 03:55.360
 because it doesn't contain much carbohydrate or sugar,

03:55.360 --> 03:58.980
 and it doesn't tend to therefore pull you out

03:58.980 --> 04:00.560
 of the molecular milieu

04:00.560 --> 04:04.240
 associated with low blood glucose states.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.960
 The other question I get is whether or not

04:05.960 --> 04:07.780
 things like fish oil break a fast.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.960
 And once again, this will be contextual,

04:10.960 --> 04:13.880
 but because fish oil is a fat,

04:13.880 --> 04:17.720
 mainly essential fatty acids, in particular EPA and DHA,

04:17.720 --> 04:20.900
 those don't tend to raise blood glucose very much.

04:20.900 --> 04:22.760
 In my case, having measured,

04:22.760 --> 04:24.820
 using a continuous glucose monitor,

04:24.820 --> 04:26.400
 my resting blood glucose, fish oil,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.640
 does not in any way change my resting blood glucose.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.140
 Chances are it won't do that for most people as well.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.840
 So does fish oil break a fast?

04:33.840 --> 04:36.200
 Chances are it does not.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.840
 And of course, people wanted to know

04:37.840 --> 04:39.840
 about pill type supplements,

04:39.840 --> 04:41.960
 caffeine and things that raise dopamine

04:41.960 --> 04:43.460
 and their vitamins and minerals.

04:43.460 --> 04:46.240
 In general, if something doesn't contain sugar

04:46.240 --> 04:49.280
 or much carbohydrate of any kind,

04:49.280 --> 04:51.500
 it's not going to raise blood glucose very much.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.480
 Now, of course, protein can raise blood glucose

04:53.480 --> 04:57.240
 and fat can too as well, although to a lesser extent.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.000
 So again, this is all contextual,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.100
 but at least by the logic that I just spelled out,

05:02.100 --> 05:05.780
 athletic greens, fish oil, and most forms of supplements,

05:05.780 --> 05:08.700
 provided they don't have any sugar or protein content,

05:08.700 --> 05:11.720
 should not quote unquote break a fast.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.560
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

05:13.560 --> 05:15.200
 that this podcast is separate

05:15.200 --> 05:17.560
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.840
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

05:19.840 --> 05:22.440
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

05:22.440 --> 05:25.040
 and science-related tools to the general public.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.080
 In keeping with that theme,

05:26.080 --> 05:28.880
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.960
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.040
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:33.040 --> 05:35.660
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

05:35.660 --> 05:38.080
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.080
 And one of the key things about our visual system

05:40.080 --> 05:42.960
 is that it's designed so that when you move into areas

05:42.960 --> 05:45.640
 where it's sunny or where there are shadows,

05:45.640 --> 05:48.820
 you can still see things with crystal clarity.

05:48.820 --> 05:50.980
 Many sunglasses out there have the problem

05:50.980 --> 05:52.640
 that you have to keep taking them off

05:52.640 --> 05:55.160
 and putting them back on depending on the overall

05:55.160 --> 05:57.460
 so-called ambient environment that you're in.

05:57.460 --> 06:00.540
 Roca sunglasses have solved this problem.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.840
 And their eyeglasses also have superb clarity

06:03.840 --> 06:06.520
 regardless of overall ambient lighting, as we say.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.320
 In other words, you see everything very clearly

06:08.320 --> 06:10.460
 no matter where you are.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.200
 They also come in a number of different styles.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.560
 The aesthetics are really terrific.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.640
 So unlike a lot of performance glasses out there

06:15.640 --> 06:17.320
 that make people look like cyborgs,

06:17.320 --> 06:18.160
 you can wear them anywhere.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.040
 You can wear them to dinner,

06:19.040 --> 06:21.300
 you can wear them to school or work or in social engagements,

06:21.300 --> 06:22.800
 and you can wear them running and cycling

06:22.800 --> 06:25.140
 and out doing your various activities.

06:25.140 --> 06:26.560
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

06:26.560 --> 06:29.280
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

06:29.280 --> 06:33.260
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.180
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.460
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral

06:38.460 --> 06:40.120
 probiotic drink.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.120
 I started using Athletic Greens way back in 2012,

06:43.120 --> 06:45.780
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.700
 The reason I started using Athletic Greens

06:47.700 --> 06:49.220
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

06:49.220 --> 06:51.860
 once or twice every day is that it covers

06:51.860 --> 06:53.980
 all of my foundational needs for vitamins,

06:53.980 --> 06:55.780
 minerals, and probiotics.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.060
 In fact, when people ask me what supplements

06:58.060 --> 07:00.260
 they should take, if I were going to recommend

07:00.260 --> 07:02.340
 just one supplement, it would be Athletic Greens

07:02.340 --> 07:05.640
 because of the enormous number of biological factors

07:05.640 --> 07:07.740
 that it impacts in a positive way.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.580
 As I mentioned, vitamins and minerals,

07:09.580 --> 07:11.000
 the probiotics are really important

07:11.000 --> 07:13.180
 for the gut microbiome and gut health,

07:13.180 --> 07:15.380
 which is important for the immune system

07:15.380 --> 07:17.200
 and for brain health and for mood

07:17.200 --> 07:19.100
 and a number of other important factors,

07:19.100 --> 07:20.900
 including hormones and so on.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.380
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

07:22.380 --> 07:25.300
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

07:25.300 --> 07:26.820
 to claim their special offer.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.480
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

07:28.480 --> 07:30.440
 which make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

07:30.440 --> 07:32.220
 while you're on the road or in the car,

07:32.220 --> 07:35.740
 and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

07:35.740 --> 07:39.460
 Vitamin D3 and K2 have been shown to be really important

07:39.460 --> 07:41.940
 for a number of important aspects

07:41.940 --> 07:43.580
 of your immediate and long-term health,

07:43.580 --> 07:46.580
 including blood lipid profiles and a number of other things.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.420
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

07:49.420 --> 07:51.560
 to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

07:51.560 --> 07:54.620
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.360
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.780
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:59.780 --> 08:02.180
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

08:02.180 --> 08:03.740
 to help you better understand your body

08:03.740 --> 08:05.820
 and help you reach your health goals.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.300
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

08:08.300 --> 08:10.800
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

08:10.800 --> 08:12.620
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

08:12.620 --> 08:15.260
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.020
 And it's for that reason that I get my blood work done

08:18.020 --> 08:19.860
 once every four to six months.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.460
 Might seem like a lot, but it has been vital

08:22.460 --> 08:24.900
 in order to keep my health where I want it

08:24.900 --> 08:26.780
 and to ensure that my health trajectory

08:26.780 --> 08:29.020
 is heading in the direction that I'd like it to go

08:29.020 --> 08:30.900
 with each passing year.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.780
 The other thing about Inside Tracker is they have DNA tests

08:33.780 --> 08:36.700
 which can tell you about the specific makeup of your genes

08:36.700 --> 08:41.100
 that can impact your particular nutrition, lifestyle,

08:41.100 --> 08:43.380
 and supplementation regimes that can also help you

08:43.380 --> 08:45.260
 steer your immediate and long-term health

08:45.260 --> 08:47.260
 in the direction that you want to go.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.520
 They make the whole thing very, very easy.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.180
 You can have the blood test taken at home,

08:51.180 --> 08:52.940
 or you can go to a local clinic.

08:52.940 --> 08:54.780
 Then the results come back.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.320
 And the wonderful thing is the platform,

08:57.320 --> 09:00.380
 the dashboard that they use, walks you through your data

09:00.380 --> 09:03.380
 and points to specific things related to nutrition.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.820
 Maybe you should be eating more of certain things,

09:05.820 --> 09:07.300
 eating less of others,

09:07.300 --> 09:09.680
 supplementing in certain ways or not,

09:09.680 --> 09:12.000
 and lifestyle factors like exercise

09:12.000 --> 09:13.960
 in order to bring the numbers into the ranges

09:13.960 --> 09:16.520
 that are right for your immediate and long-term health.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.980
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

09:17.980 --> 09:20.620
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

09:20.620 --> 09:23.340

09:26.100 --> 09:28.020
 So let's talk about time perception.

09:28.020 --> 09:30.540
 And the most fundamental aspect of time perception

09:30.540 --> 09:32.700
 is something called entrainment.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.600
 Entrainment is the way in which your internal processes,

09:36.600 --> 09:39.040
 your biology and your psychology,

09:39.040 --> 09:42.300
 are linked to some external thing.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.420
 And the most basic form of entrainment

09:44.420 --> 09:48.660
 that we are all a slave to all year round

09:48.660 --> 09:53.660
 for our entire life are so-called circannual rhythms.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.420
 We have neurons, nerve cells in our eye, in our brain,

09:58.420 --> 10:01.540
 and in our body that are marking off

10:01.540 --> 10:04.380
 the passage of time throughout the year,

10:04.380 --> 10:07.140
 literally a calendar system in your brain and body.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.960
 And the way this works is beautifully simple.

10:11.260 --> 10:15.420
 Light seen by your eyes inhibits,

10:15.420 --> 10:17.920
 meaning it reduces the amount of a hormone

10:17.920 --> 10:21.340
 released in your brain called melatonin.

10:21.340 --> 10:23.880
 Melatonin has two major functions.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.140
 One function is to make you sleepy at night,

10:26.140 --> 10:29.260
 and the other is to regulate some of the other hormones

10:29.260 --> 10:31.900
 of the body, in particular, testosterone and estrogen.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.060
 When we view light,

10:35.060 --> 10:37.060
 we reduce the amount of melatonin released.

10:37.060 --> 10:38.900
 In fact, if you wake up in the middle of the night

10:38.900 --> 10:40.980
 when melatonin typically is pretty high

10:40.980 --> 10:42.180
 in your brain and body,

10:42.180 --> 10:44.580
 and you flip on a bright light in the bathroom,

10:44.580 --> 10:47.820
 your melatonin levels crash down to almost zero

10:47.820 --> 10:49.500
 and stay there.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.820
 Light is a very powerful modulator of melatonin,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.940
 and light inhibits melatonin.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.020
 Throughout the year, depending on where you live,

10:59.020 --> 11:02.060
 day length varies, and as a consequence,

11:02.060 --> 11:04.820
 the amount of light from the sun

11:04.820 --> 11:07.260
 that is available to you varies.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.580
 So when days are long,

11:09.580 --> 11:11.760
 the amount of melatonin in your brain and body

11:11.760 --> 11:14.380
 that's released tends to be less.

11:14.380 --> 11:15.240
 There's less of it,

11:15.240 --> 11:18.340
 and it's released for shorter amounts of time, okay?

11:18.340 --> 11:20.460
 Because light inhibits melatonin.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.320
 When days are very short,

11:22.320 --> 11:24.400
 the amount of melatonin that's released

11:24.400 --> 11:26.600
 and the duration that that melatonin exists

11:26.600 --> 11:29.320
 in your brain and body tends to be much longer.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.780
 So melatonin correlates with day length,

11:33.820 --> 11:36.100
 and if we are viewing more light,

11:36.100 --> 11:38.580
 we have less melatonin, we view less light,

11:38.580 --> 11:40.440
 we have more melatonin.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.440
 You see different amounts of light each day,

11:45.440 --> 11:48.900
 but we have a process in our brain and body

11:48.900 --> 11:51.260
 that averages the amount of light that you're seeing,

11:51.260 --> 11:53.780
 both from artificial sources and from sunlight,

11:53.780 --> 11:58.640
 and measures that off, and it's so exquisitely precise

11:58.640 --> 12:03.180
 that for a given, say, eight-hour day in the spring,

12:03.180 --> 12:05.860
 because spring in the Northern Hemisphere or elsewhere,

12:05.860 --> 12:07.240
 days are getting longer,

12:08.700 --> 12:11.140
 that means that the amount of melatonin

12:11.140 --> 12:13.380
 is getting progressively less and less,

12:13.380 --> 12:15.660
 and that signal is conveyed to all the systems

12:15.660 --> 12:18.420
 of your brain and body, and this is why most people,

12:18.420 --> 12:19.580
 not all, but most people,

12:19.580 --> 12:22.860
 feel like they have more energy in the spring.

12:22.860 --> 12:27.700
 Conversely, when you have an eight-hour day in the winter,

12:27.700 --> 12:29.860
 the amount of melatonin that corresponds

12:29.860 --> 12:31.660
 to that eight-hour day

12:31.660 --> 12:34.460
 is getting progressively greater and greater,

12:34.460 --> 12:35.460
 because why?

12:35.460 --> 12:36.580
 Days are getting shorter,

12:36.580 --> 12:40.480
 so melatonin is increasing from day to day to day.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.880
 Every cell and system of your body pays attention to this,

12:42.880 --> 12:44.660
 and as a consequence, most people, not all,

12:44.660 --> 12:46.940
 but most people feel they have a little less

12:46.940 --> 12:48.580
 or sometimes a lot less energy

12:48.580 --> 12:51.480
 and a slightly lower mood in the winter months.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.780
 Now, there are exceptions to this, of course,

12:53.780 --> 12:56.640
 but the melatonin signal is the way

12:56.640 --> 13:00.220
 in which your internal state, your mood,

13:00.220 --> 13:03.340
 your sense of energy, even your appetite,

13:03.340 --> 13:07.180
 is entrained, is matched to some external event.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.420
 In this case, the event is the rotation

13:09.420 --> 13:11.340
 of the Earth around the sun.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.560
 There are other forms of entrainment,

13:13.560 --> 13:16.040
 meaning the matching of your brain and body

13:16.040 --> 13:18.800
 to things that are happening in your external environment.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.820
 One particularly interesting example of this

13:20.820 --> 13:23.940
 was published last year by Perik et al. in Cell Report,

13:23.940 --> 13:25.960
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,

13:25.960 --> 13:28.740
 showing that across the calendar year,

13:28.740 --> 13:31.260
 the amount of testosterone and estrogen

13:31.260 --> 13:33.740
 that human beings make varies,

13:33.740 --> 13:35.820
 such that in longer days,

13:35.820 --> 13:38.260
 they tend to make more testosterone and estrogen

13:38.260 --> 13:39.420
 than in shorter days,

13:39.420 --> 13:41.800
 and this was correlated with things like

13:41.800 --> 13:43.740
 desire to seek out romantic partners

13:43.740 --> 13:47.140
 or have romantic interactions with their existing partners,

13:47.140 --> 13:50.820
 even aggression, although not violent aggression,

13:50.820 --> 13:52.980
 but sense of kind of willingness to argue

13:52.980 --> 13:56.180
 and to get into kind of combative states

13:56.180 --> 13:58.340
 and overall energy and mood.

13:58.340 --> 13:59.980
 This is something that had been hypothesized

13:59.980 --> 14:01.300
 for a long time, but it had never really

14:01.300 --> 14:02.940
 been cleanly demonstrated,

14:02.940 --> 14:06.660
 and what they showed was that it's actually the skin

14:06.660 --> 14:08.960
 that's taking information about the amount of light

14:08.960 --> 14:10.940
 and converting it into these increases

14:10.940 --> 14:12.700
 in testosterone and estrogen.

14:12.700 --> 14:17.500
 Light exposure to the skin turns out about two hours a day.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.380
 This was sunlight, in this case, to the upper body.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.280
 These people weren't naked.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.980
 They were wearing clothes, but their arms were exposed.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.140
 Their upper back and neck and face were exposed.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.060
 They were not wearing hats.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.820
 Resulted in large increases,

14:29.820 --> 14:32.700
 significant increases in testosterone and estrogen.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.580
 Now, you could probably export a tool from that

14:34.580 --> 14:35.580
 if you liked.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.260
 That's not really what this podcast is about,

14:37.260 --> 14:40.700
 but it's very clear that because the skin is acting

14:40.700 --> 14:42.900
 as an endocrine organ, excuse me,

14:42.900 --> 14:46.120
 as kind of a hormone influencing organ,

14:46.120 --> 14:49.100
 that getting light on the skin, not just to the eyes,

14:49.100 --> 14:51.580
 can influence our sense of wellbeing

14:51.580 --> 14:53.000
 by these hormone pathways.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.580
 And the threshold there, again,

14:54.580 --> 14:55.960
 seemed to be about two hours a day.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.660
 It doesn't have to be very bright outside.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.300
 There can be cloud cover and so on.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.760
 Many people will probably ask,

15:01.760 --> 15:03.600
 will sunscreen inhibit this effect?

15:03.600 --> 15:05.580
 And it doesn't appear that it does.

15:05.580 --> 15:09.980
 Obviously, prioritize skin health and avoiding skin cancer.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.620
 Sunscreen is kind of a controversial topic nowadays.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.340
 Maybe the topic for another podcast episode at some point.

15:16.340 --> 15:19.460
 But nonetheless, what the Perik et al study shows,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.360
 and that's most relevant to today's podcast,

15:21.360 --> 15:23.500
 is that we are entrained,

15:23.500 --> 15:26.380
 we are matched to the external light-dark cycle.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.620
 And as the day length changes, our hormones change.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.100
 And we can override that with exposure to bright lights.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.380
 You know, people go sit on tanning beds.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.440
 It's not a practice I particularly myself engage in,

15:38.440 --> 15:39.580
 but you know, there are a number of different ways

15:39.580 --> 15:41.700
 that people can override these processes.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.220
 But the point is very simple.

15:44.220 --> 15:49.220
 The point is that our perception of time is both conscious,

15:49.220 --> 15:52.060
 you know, it's waiting, watching the clock tick down,

15:52.060 --> 15:54.700
 and there are these slower, what we call oscillatory,

15:54.700 --> 15:58.220
 meaning up and down, repeatedly slower oscillatory events

15:58.220 --> 16:01.280
 related to day length that are influencing our hormones,

16:01.280 --> 16:03.180
 like melatonin, testosterone, and estrogen,

16:03.180 --> 16:04.980
 and therefore our mood, our outlook,

16:04.980 --> 16:06.420
 and even our behavior.

16:06.420 --> 16:10.600
 The next level of time, or bin of time, as we say,

16:11.660 --> 16:14.900
 that we are all entrained or matched to

16:14.900 --> 16:17.600
 is the so-called circadian time cycle,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.040
 which is 24-hour rhythm.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.580
 This is perhaps the most powerful rhythm that we all contain

16:24.580 --> 16:26.840
 and that none of us can escape from.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.900
 We all have this circadian clock

16:30.900 --> 16:32.760
 that resides over the roof of our mouth,

16:32.760 --> 16:35.620
 the cells in that circadian clock fire,

16:35.620 --> 16:39.940
 meaning they release chemicals into our brain and body

16:39.940 --> 16:41.300
 on a very regular rhythm.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.040
 So across the 24-hour cycle,

16:44.040 --> 16:46.320
 they will be very active at some periods

16:46.320 --> 16:48.220
 and less active at others.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.240
 Not surprisingly, there are periods of every 24-hour cycle

16:52.240 --> 16:54.880
 when we are very active and we tend to be alert,

16:54.880 --> 16:57.040
 and others when we are asleep.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.420
 Now, I've talked a lot about circadian rhythms and sleep

16:59.420 --> 17:01.060
 on this podcast previously,

17:01.060 --> 17:03.280
 and so I don't want to repeat too much of that information

17:03.280 --> 17:05.100
 in detail, but I'm just going to give a summary

17:05.100 --> 17:07.140
 of how circadian entrainment works

17:07.140 --> 17:10.020
 because I haven't really covered that

17:10.020 --> 17:11.720
 in the context of time perception.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.140
 We have this circadian clock.

17:15.140 --> 17:15.980
 It oscillates.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.780
 It goes up and down once every 24 hours and then repeats.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.820
 Every cell of our body has a 24-hour oscillation

17:22.820 --> 17:24.800
 in the expression of various genes.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.700
 How that works is actually really simple,

17:26.700 --> 17:29.160
 elegant, and interesting.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.380
 DNA genes make RNA.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.520
 RNA is converted into proteins.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.880
 Every cell in our body has this beautiful 24-hour timer

17:39.880 --> 17:42.100
 where a gene is expressed,

17:42.100 --> 17:45.600
 and the important thing to understand about a given gene

17:45.600 --> 17:49.220
 in this context is that that gene is inhibited,

17:49.220 --> 17:52.740
 meaning it's reduced by a particular protein,

17:52.740 --> 17:55.820
 by a little biological molecule in that cell.

17:55.820 --> 17:59.400
 So the gene gets expressed when there's very little

17:59.400 --> 18:01.340
 of that other molecule around.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.060
 DNA then becomes RNA.

18:04.060 --> 18:06.540
 RNA is translated into a protein,

18:06.540 --> 18:09.700
 and that protein goes way, way up, and the gene shuts down,

18:09.700 --> 18:12.420
 but as that protein gets used up

18:12.420 --> 18:14.620
 and its levels eventually drop low, low, low, low, low

18:14.620 --> 18:17.460
 to zero, the gene cycle kicks in again,

18:17.460 --> 18:18.540
 and the gene gets expressed.

18:18.540 --> 18:21.260
 The RNA gets expressed in the protein again.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.580
 This all happens on a 24-hour cycle,

18:23.580 --> 18:25.860
 so it's a little built-in timer in each and every one

18:25.860 --> 18:27.880
 of our cells, and I didn't list off the genes,

18:27.880 --> 18:29.260
 but for the aficionados out there,

18:29.260 --> 18:32.380
 they go by names like per, for period, bmal, clock,

18:32.380 --> 18:33.220
 and all these different things.

18:33.220 --> 18:34.260
 We call them the clock genes,

18:34.260 --> 18:35.580
 and those clock genes regulate

18:35.580 --> 18:36.540
 a number of different functions.

18:36.540 --> 18:39.380
 So every cell in our body has a 24-hour cycle

18:39.380 --> 18:41.480
 of gene and protein expression,

18:41.480 --> 18:44.820
 and the earth rotates once every 24 hours,

18:44.820 --> 18:46.780
 and the processes that are happening

18:46.780 --> 18:49.700
 in every cell of our body are linked.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.500
 They are entrained, as we say,

18:51.500 --> 18:56.420
 to the outside light-dark cycle because morning sunlight,

18:56.420 --> 19:00.660
 evening sunlight, and the lack of light

19:00.660 --> 19:05.180
 in the middle of the night make sure that the changes,

19:05.180 --> 19:07.780
 these oscillations that are occurring within the cells

19:07.780 --> 19:09.840
 of our brain and body are matched

19:09.840 --> 19:11.540
 to the outside light-dark cycle.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.660
 And I want to go into all the details of how that happens,

19:13.660 --> 19:16.140
 but there's some very simple tools that one can use

19:16.140 --> 19:18.620
 to ensure that your entrainment,

19:18.620 --> 19:21.580
 your circadian entrainment is precise.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.660
 And I cannot emphasize enough how important it is

19:24.660 --> 19:27.560
 that your circadian entrainment be precise.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.240
 Why?

19:29.240 --> 19:31.840
 Because disruptions in circadian entrainment

19:31.840 --> 19:33.260
 cause huge health problems.

19:33.260 --> 19:34.780
 They increase cancer risk.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.460
 They increase obesity.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.820
 They increase mental health issues.

19:38.820 --> 19:41.200
 They decrease wound healing.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.420
 They decrease physical and mental performance.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.740
 They disrupt hormones.

19:44.740 --> 19:48.620
 You want your cells to be linked to the circadian cycle

19:48.620 --> 19:49.460
 that's outside you.

19:49.460 --> 19:52.180
 And the circadian cycle outside you mainly consists

19:52.180 --> 19:54.940
 of when there's sunlight and when there is not.

19:54.940 --> 19:58.120
 And that's why the simple protocols to fall out

19:58.120 --> 20:00.580
 of this whole discussion about circadian entrainment

20:00.580 --> 20:01.700
 are the following.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.720
 View 10 to 30 minutes of bright light, ideally sunlight,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.420
 within an hour of waking,

20:06.420 --> 20:07.840
 assuming that you're waking early in the day,

20:07.840 --> 20:09.620
 especially you wake up early in the day,

20:09.620 --> 20:10.840
 get outside, see sunlight.

20:10.840 --> 20:14.020
 Do that again in the afternoon or around evening,

20:14.020 --> 20:16.980
 10 to 30 minutes, depending on how bright it is outside.

20:16.980 --> 20:19.060
 Artificial lights throughout the day,

20:19.060 --> 20:21.940
 or if you want to be awake and you wake up early

20:21.940 --> 20:23.540
 and there's no sunlight outside,

20:23.540 --> 20:25.380
 you can of course turn on artificial lights

20:25.380 --> 20:26.280
 if you want to be awake.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.220
 But basically you want as much bright light,

20:28.220 --> 20:30.540
 ideally from sunlight, coming in through your eyes

20:30.540 --> 20:31.660
 throughout the day.

20:31.660 --> 20:32.940
 And then in the evening,

20:32.940 --> 20:35.300
 you want as little bright light coming in

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
 through your eyes.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.740
 I've said this over and over and over again on this podcast.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.240
 There's always a lot of negotiations,

20:40.240 --> 20:41.940
 but I want to make a few things clear.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.260
 Try not to wear sunglasses if you can do it safely.

20:44.260 --> 20:46.340
 Find to wear eyeglasses or contacts.

20:46.340 --> 20:47.980
 That's not going to be a problem.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.100
 The light viewing that you do

20:51.100 --> 20:53.140
 and the avoidance of light at night,

20:53.140 --> 20:58.140
 set the fundamental layer of your time perception.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.420
 One of the best ways to disrupt your perception of time

21:02.420 --> 21:03.920
 in the ways that we're going to talk about

21:03.920 --> 21:06.260
 in the subsequent portions of the podcast

21:06.260 --> 21:07.960
 is to disrupt your circadian clock.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.460
 And that is not a good thing

21:09.460 --> 21:11.400
 for a number of different reasons.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.860
 There are other ways to so-called

21:12.860 --> 21:14.280
 entrain your circadian clock.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.060
 One of the best ways to do that

21:16.060 --> 21:18.960
 is to engage in physical activity

21:18.960 --> 21:20.660
 at fairly regular times of day.

21:20.660 --> 21:21.740
 You don't have to do it every day,

21:21.740 --> 21:23.360
 but if you're going to exercise,

21:23.360 --> 21:25.980
 try and exercise at a fairly consistent time of day.

21:25.980 --> 21:29.040
 Probably better to exercise than to not exercise,

21:29.040 --> 21:31.380
 even if you have to move that time of day.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.340
 But light, activity,

21:33.340 --> 21:35.860
 and we'll talk about the third in a minute, food,

21:35.860 --> 21:38.260
 are the major ways that you entrain

21:38.260 --> 21:40.140
 your internal perception of time

21:40.140 --> 21:43.640
 to the external events of the world,

21:43.640 --> 21:45.540
 meaning that the turning of the earth

21:45.540 --> 21:48.700
 and therefore the exposure to sunlight or not.

21:48.700 --> 21:52.340
 So in addition to the sunlight viewing

21:52.340 --> 21:53.460
 in the morning and throughout the day

21:53.460 --> 21:55.300
 and avoiding bright light at night of any kind,

21:55.300 --> 21:56.740
 not just blue light,

21:56.740 --> 21:57.980
 trying to get your activity,

21:57.980 --> 22:00.060
 your exercise at fairly regular

22:00.060 --> 22:04.000
 within plus or minus two hours from each day to the next

22:04.000 --> 22:05.880
 is going to have a very positive effect

22:05.880 --> 22:08.100
 on so-called circadian entrainment.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.760
 And also eating at fairly regular times.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.200
 However, this is exciting.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.900
 The data mainly point to the fact

22:14.900 --> 22:15.740
 that you need to eat

22:15.740 --> 22:18.860
 within more or less the same time window each day,

22:18.860 --> 22:20.900
 not that you always need to eat your meals

22:20.900 --> 22:22.740
 at exactly the same time.

22:22.740 --> 22:26.000
 So you don't necessarily have to eat lunch at noon

22:26.000 --> 22:28.300
 and a snack at four and dinner at eight

22:28.300 --> 22:30.660
 in order to keep your circadian entrainment

22:30.660 --> 22:33.440
 aligned or sharp.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.540
 You could, for instance, have a small snack at noon

22:35.540 --> 22:37.620
 and then eat at two and then have dinner at six

22:37.620 --> 22:38.740
 and then a small snack at eight.

22:38.740 --> 22:42.460
 It doesn't so much matter when the exact meals fall

22:42.460 --> 22:44.060
 so much as that they fall more or less

22:44.060 --> 22:48.540
 within a consistent period or phase of each 24 hour cycle.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.200
 What happens when this circadian clock

22:53.200 --> 22:54.340
 starts getting disrupted?

22:54.340 --> 22:57.140
 I mean, this is after all an episode about time perception.

22:57.140 --> 23:00.340
 It's not an episode about circadian rhythms and entrainment.

23:00.340 --> 23:05.340
 Well, there's a classic study by Ashoff done in 1985

23:05.840 --> 23:07.600
 that's now been repeated many times

23:07.600 --> 23:10.100
 where they had people go into environments

23:10.100 --> 23:12.480
 where they didn't have clocks and they didn't have windows

23:12.480 --> 23:14.020
 and they didn't have watches.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.740
 And they were sometimes even in constant dark

23:15.740 --> 23:17.180
 or constant light.

23:17.180 --> 23:21.500
 And they evaluated how well people perceive

23:21.500 --> 23:24.180
 the passage of time on shorter timescales.

23:24.180 --> 23:25.760
 And what they found was really interesting.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.160
 What they found is that people underestimate

23:28.160 --> 23:30.180
 how long they were in these isolated environments.

23:30.180 --> 23:33.300
 So after 42 days or so, they'd ask people,

23:33.300 --> 23:34.460
 how long do you think you've been in here?

23:34.460 --> 23:38.140
 And people would say 28 days or 36 days.

23:38.140 --> 23:41.140
 They generally underestimated how long they had been

23:41.140 --> 23:43.820
 in this very odd environment with no clocks or watches

23:43.820 --> 23:46.540
 or exposure to sunlight or regular rhythms

23:46.540 --> 23:48.300
 of artificial light.

23:48.300 --> 23:51.740
 In addition, they found that their perception

23:51.740 --> 23:55.380
 of shorter time intervals was also really disrupted.

23:55.380 --> 23:58.400
 So if they asked them to measure off two minutes,

23:58.400 --> 23:59.720
 normally people are pretty good

23:59.720 --> 24:00.740
 at measuring off two minutes.

24:00.740 --> 24:05.060
 People come within five to 15 seconds at most.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.460
 If you kind of had to sit there and just wait,

24:07.460 --> 24:09.300
 you have a pretty good idea of when two minutes is up,

24:09.300 --> 24:10.620
 you say two minutes is up.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.100
 Well, when people's circadian clocks

24:13.100 --> 24:16.060
 or circadian entrainment, I should say, was disrupted,

24:16.060 --> 24:20.780
 their perception of time measurement on shorter timescales

24:20.780 --> 24:24.180
 of minutes or even seconds was greatly disrupted.

24:24.180 --> 24:25.700
 And as we'll see in a couple of minutes,

24:25.700 --> 24:28.380
 that actually causes great problems

24:28.380 --> 24:30.260
 for how you contend with work,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.060
 how you contend with challenges of different kinds.

24:33.060 --> 24:37.900
 You want your circadian entrainment to be pretty locked in

24:37.900 --> 24:40.860
 or pretty entrained to the outside light-dark cycle

24:40.860 --> 24:42.980
 so that your perception of time

24:42.980 --> 24:46.180
 on shorter time intervals can be precise

24:46.180 --> 24:48.860
 because the ability to perceive time accurately

24:48.860 --> 24:52.380
 for the given task or given thing that you're involved in

24:52.380 --> 24:55.140
 turns out to be one of the most fundamental ways

24:55.140 --> 24:57.940
 that predicts how well or poorly you perform

24:57.940 --> 24:59.580
 that thing or task.

24:59.580 --> 25:02.460
 So we've talked about circadian entrainment,

25:02.460 --> 25:04.220
 the matching of the cells and tissues

25:04.220 --> 25:08.340
 and organs of our body to the 365-day journey

25:08.340 --> 25:11.320
 that the earth takes around the sun each year.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.820
 And we talked about circadian entrainment,

25:13.820 --> 25:18.200
 the way that the 24-hour genetic and protein clocks

25:18.200 --> 25:20.940
 of each and every one of our cells is matched

25:20.940 --> 25:23.700
 to the rotation of the earth on its axis

25:23.700 --> 25:28.180
 and the exposure or lack of exposure to the sun

25:28.180 --> 25:30.940
 because of that rotation on its axis.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.060
 Next, I'd like to talk about so-called

25:33.060 --> 25:34.780
 ultradian entrainment.

25:34.780 --> 25:38.900
 Ultradian rhythms are rhythms of about 90 minutes or so,

25:38.900 --> 25:41.620
 and all of our existence is broken up

25:41.620 --> 25:44.200
 into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.420
 When you go to sleep at night,

25:45.420 --> 25:47.180
 whether or not you sleep six hours or four hours

25:47.180 --> 25:49.020
 or eight hours or 10 hours,

25:49.020 --> 25:51.700
 that entire period of sleep is broken up

25:51.700 --> 25:54.260
 into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.260
 Early in the night, you tend to have more slow-wave sleep.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.320
 Later in the night, you tend to have more REM sleep,

25:58.320 --> 26:00.700
 but nonetheless, your sleep is broken up

26:00.700 --> 26:02.400
 into these 90-minute cycles.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.660
 However, when you wake up in the morning,

26:04.660 --> 26:07.780
 many of the things that you do are governed

26:07.780 --> 26:09.920
 by these ultradian rhythms.

26:10.940 --> 26:14.100
 For instance, if you were to work,

26:14.100 --> 26:17.280
 meaning do math or try and learn a language

26:17.280 --> 26:19.740
 or do physical work of any kind or work out,

26:20.900 --> 26:23.780
 the 90-minute time block seems to be the one

26:23.780 --> 26:27.660
 in which the brain can enter a state of focus and alertness

26:27.660 --> 26:29.640
 and do hard work and focus, focus, focus,

26:29.640 --> 26:32.680
 and then at about 90 minutes,

26:32.680 --> 26:35.100
 there's a significant drop in your ability

26:35.100 --> 26:38.060
 to engage in this mental or physical work.

26:38.060 --> 26:42.380
 Now, everybody from the self-help literature

26:42.380 --> 26:45.380
 to the business literature to the pop psychology literature

26:45.380 --> 26:48.020
 has tried to leverage these ultradian cycles

26:48.020 --> 26:50.700
 by saying if you're going to do something hard

26:50.700 --> 26:51.740
 and you want to focus on it,

26:51.740 --> 26:53.100
 limit it to 90 minutes or less,

26:53.100 --> 26:54.140
 and I am one of those people

26:54.140 --> 26:55.860
 who's also joined that conversation,

26:55.860 --> 26:58.100
 and indeed, I use 90-minute work cycles,

26:58.100 --> 27:00.700
 and I think they are extremely powerful.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.540
 One should never expect that you're going to drop

27:02.540 --> 27:05.660
 immediately into a state of high focus at the beginning

27:05.660 --> 27:07.620
 and then remain there for 90 minutes.

27:07.620 --> 27:10.880
 We all struggle to varying degrees to achieve focus

27:10.880 --> 27:13.580
 and motivation and drive within those 90-minute cycles,

27:13.580 --> 27:17.500
 but it is true, meaning there is ample literature

27:17.500 --> 27:21.720
 to support the idea that after about 90 minutes,

27:21.720 --> 27:25.460
 we tend to go into a state of less ability to focus.

27:25.460 --> 27:28.900
 So while this isn't time perception per se,

27:28.900 --> 27:31.780
 it is, again, an example of entrainment.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.180
 What are we in training to, right?

27:34.180 --> 27:36.020
 Just because we can focus for 90 minutes

27:36.020 --> 27:39.560
 and then not so well at 100 minutes or 120 minutes,

27:39.560 --> 27:40.660
 what are we in training to?

27:40.660 --> 27:41.780
 Well, what you're in training to

27:41.780 --> 27:44.800
 is the release of particular neurochemicals,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.180
 in this case, acetylcholine and dopamine,

27:47.180 --> 27:49.140
 that allow your brain to focus

27:49.140 --> 27:52.240
 for particular periods of time, 90 minutes or so,

27:52.240 --> 27:55.500
 and after about 90 minutes or so,

27:55.500 --> 27:57.620
 the amount of those chemicals that can be released

27:57.620 --> 27:58.600
 tends to drop very low,

27:58.600 --> 28:02.760
 which is why your ability to focus becomes diminished.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.580
 If one would like to explore more about the kind of backbone

28:05.580 --> 28:08.660
 and basis of these ultradian rhythms,

28:08.660 --> 28:09.860
 it goes by a different name.

28:09.860 --> 28:13.960
 This was originally called the basic rest activity cycle.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.620
 This was proposed many years ago by Nathaniel Kleitman.

28:17.620 --> 28:20.940
 It was established to be true within sleep states,

28:20.940 --> 28:21.900
 as I mentioned before.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.420
 Then it was debated for a long time

28:23.420 --> 28:25.460
 whether or not these 90-minute cycles

28:25.460 --> 28:28.220
 also control our ability to focus

28:28.220 --> 28:30.020
 and perform work in wakeful states,

28:30.020 --> 28:31.020
 and it turns out that they do.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.820
 Now there's a lot of literature to support that.

28:33.820 --> 28:34.840
 I always get the question,

28:34.840 --> 28:37.140
 how do you know when the 90-minute cycle begins?

28:37.140 --> 28:40.200
 In other words, let's say you wake up at 8 a.m.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.340
 and you just finished a 90-minute sleep cycle.

28:42.340 --> 28:45.100
 Does that mean that your next 90-minute cycle

28:45.100 --> 28:47.680
 where you could do work begins right at 801?

28:47.680 --> 28:48.740
 No.

28:48.740 --> 28:51.720
 The interesting thing about these basic rest activity cycles,

28:51.720 --> 28:53.020
 these ultradian rhythms,

28:53.020 --> 28:56.100
 is that you can initiate them whenever you want.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.820
 This is not like a circadian rhythm,

28:57.820 --> 29:02.820
 which is a hardwired, unerring signal of 24 hours.

29:03.020 --> 29:06.220
 The ultradian rhythms that occur during sleep

29:06.220 --> 29:08.820
 are hardwired, unerring.

29:08.820 --> 29:11.180
 You don't get the option of making your sleep cycles

29:11.180 --> 29:13.460
 at 120 minutes or five minutes.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.660
 You don't get that option.

29:15.660 --> 29:17.700
 But if you decide that you want to apply

29:17.700 --> 29:20.140
 ultradian rhythms to work and performance,

29:20.140 --> 29:21.940
 you can set a clock and decide,

29:21.940 --> 29:25.520
 okay, now the focus begins, now the work begins,

29:25.520 --> 29:27.420
 and this 90-minute cycle is the period

29:27.420 --> 29:28.660
 in which I'm going to do work.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.220
 And I actually do this.

29:30.220 --> 29:31.980
 Mid-morning and sometimes twice a day,

29:31.980 --> 29:35.720
 I do a 90-minute cycle where I limit all distraction

29:35.720 --> 29:37.340
 as much as possible, put away my phone,

29:37.340 --> 29:38.760
 often turn off the internet as well.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.540
 I talked about this in an episode

29:40.540 --> 29:43.420
 on kind of an optimal work day,

29:43.420 --> 29:45.380
 at least for me, just to give an example

29:45.380 --> 29:46.700
 of how this might work.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.860
 But I want to emphasize again

29:48.860 --> 29:52.040
 that these ultradian rhythms are ones that you set.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.600
 So you decide I'm going to work for 90 minutes.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.640
 What you can't negotiate, however,

29:56.640 --> 29:59.760
 is that at about 100 minutes or 120 minutes,

29:59.760 --> 30:00.720
 no matter who you are,

30:00.720 --> 30:03.680
 you're going to see a diminishment in performance.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.900
 You're not going to focus as well.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.260
 And that's, again, because of the way

30:07.260 --> 30:09.260
 that these 90-minute cycles are linked

30:09.260 --> 30:10.700
 to the ability of the neurons

30:10.700 --> 30:12.700
 that release acetylcholine and dopamine

30:12.700 --> 30:14.060
 and to some extent norepinephrine,

30:14.060 --> 30:17.020
 the things that give us narrow focus, motivation, and drive,

30:17.020 --> 30:18.820
 the way that these 90-minute cycles

30:18.820 --> 30:21.920
 are involved in those circuits.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.040
 After about 90 minutes,

30:23.040 --> 30:25.660
 those circuits are far less willing to engage,

30:25.660 --> 30:27.460
 and therefore it's much harder

30:27.460 --> 30:30.660
 to continue to focus to a high degree.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.980
 Some people like to do multiple 90-minute cycles

30:32.980 --> 30:33.840
 per day of focus.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.580
 In that case, you need to separate them out.

30:35.580 --> 30:37.220
 You can't do one 90-minute cycle

30:37.220 --> 30:39.020
 then go right into another 90-minute cycle

30:39.020 --> 30:40.180
 then another 90-minute cycle.

30:40.180 --> 30:43.220
 You can't cheat these circuits related to acetylcholine

30:43.220 --> 30:46.260
 and dopamine and norepinephrine, unfortunately.

30:46.260 --> 30:49.180
 I suggest that people do no more than three,

30:49.180 --> 30:51.020
 and ideally it would be two

30:51.020 --> 30:53.340
 or just one of these 90-minute cycles.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.460
 Why did I say ideally?

30:54.460 --> 30:56.580
 Well, they are very taxing.

30:56.580 --> 30:59.340
 You are in a very narrow tunnel of focus.

30:59.340 --> 31:01.980
 So for me, I can do one mid-morning.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.220
 I can probably do another one in the afternoon.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.380
 This is not the kind of work that's like checking email

31:06.380 --> 31:07.840
 or text messaging or social media.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.060
 This is very focused, hard work.

31:10.060 --> 31:12.700
 Working on hard problems of various kinds,

31:12.700 --> 31:14.720
 and this will be different for everybody.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.240
 So I recommend that they be spaced

31:16.240 --> 31:18.620
 by at least two to four hours,

31:18.620 --> 31:21.100
 and most people probably won't be able to handle

31:21.100 --> 31:22.900
 more than two per day.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.240
 There are probably some mutants out there

31:24.240 --> 31:27.220
 that could do three or four, but that's exceedingly rare.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.180
 I think even one a day is going to feel

31:29.180 --> 31:31.580
 like a significant mental investment,

31:31.580 --> 31:33.820
 and afterwards, you're going to feel pretty taxed.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.780
 So now we've talked about circannual,

31:35.780 --> 31:39.040
 circadian, and ultradian rhythms,

31:39.040 --> 31:42.380
 but we haven't really talked about time perception per se.

31:42.380 --> 31:44.900
 We've mainly talked about the subconscious,

31:44.900 --> 31:48.260
 slow oscillatory ways in which we are entrained

31:48.260 --> 31:50.820
 or matched to the year or to the day,

31:50.820 --> 31:55.380
 and these ultradian cycles that we can impose on our work

31:55.380 --> 31:59.080
 and that we can leverage toward more focus if we like.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.020
 But what about the actual perception of time?

32:02.020 --> 32:04.500
 What actually controls how fast

32:04.500 --> 32:08.260
 or how slowly we perceive time going by?

32:08.260 --> 32:11.060
 There are basically three forms of time perception

32:11.060 --> 32:12.820
 that we should all be aware of.

32:12.820 --> 32:15.740
 One is our perception of the passage of time in the present,

32:15.740 --> 32:19.500
 how quickly or slowly things seem to be happening for us.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.620
 This is kind of like an interval timer, ticking off time,

32:22.620 --> 32:24.340
 tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

32:24.340 --> 32:29.340
 It's either fine slicing like that or tick, tick, tick.

32:29.820 --> 32:31.420
 We have interval timers.

32:31.420 --> 32:33.720
 I'll discuss the basis of those interval timers.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.420
 We also engage in what's called prospective timing,

32:36.420 --> 32:38.780
 which is like a stopwatch, measuring off things

32:38.780 --> 32:40.220
 as they go forward.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.140
 That might sound a little bit like what I just described,

32:42.140 --> 32:44.240
 but it's actually a little bit different.

32:44.240 --> 32:48.840
 For instance, if I told you to start measuring off

32:48.840 --> 32:51.800
 a two-minute time interval into the future,

32:51.800 --> 32:53.820
 you could do that pretty well.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.980
 But if I told you you had to measure

32:55.980 --> 32:58.380
 a five-minute time interval into the future

32:58.380 --> 33:00.260
 and you couldn't use any clocks or watches

33:00.260 --> 33:02.220
 or your phone or anything like that,

33:02.220 --> 33:05.320
 you would have to set the tick marks.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.060
 You would have to decide how many times

33:08.060 --> 33:09.220
 you were going to count off

33:09.220 --> 33:11.940
 during that five-minute time block.

33:11.940 --> 33:14.060
 There's also retrospective time,

33:14.060 --> 33:17.660
 which is how you measure off time in the past.

33:17.660 --> 33:21.180
 So if I say, you know, last week I know you went

33:21.180 --> 33:23.040
 to the park, you did some things with friends,

33:23.040 --> 33:25.320
 you know, you went out in the evening.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.020
 How long was it between lunch

33:28.020 --> 33:29.300
 and when you went to dinner with friends?

33:29.300 --> 33:30.880
 You probably then go, okay, well, I remember

33:30.880 --> 33:33.840
 I went to dinner at seven and we had lunch right around two.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.500
 You're using memory to reconstruct certain sets

33:37.500 --> 33:39.260
 of events in the past and get a sense

33:39.260 --> 33:42.340
 of their relative positioning within time, okay?

33:42.340 --> 33:44.720
 So we have retrospective, current time interval

33:44.720 --> 33:47.340
 measurements, and then prospective time measurement

33:47.340 --> 33:48.280
 into the future.

33:50.160 --> 33:54.660
 The beauty of time perception in the human nervous system

33:54.660 --> 33:59.140
 is that it boils down to a couple of simple molecules

33:59.140 --> 34:03.160
 that govern whether or not we are fine slicing time

34:03.160 --> 34:06.360
 or whether or not we are batching time in larger bins.

34:07.340 --> 34:09.940
 Those molecules go by names that maybe you've heard,

34:09.940 --> 34:12.140
 things like dopamine and norepinephrine,

34:12.140 --> 34:14.260
 neuromodulators, called neuromodulators

34:14.260 --> 34:16.120
 because they modulate, they change the way

34:16.120 --> 34:17.720
 that other neural circuits work.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.220
 Also things like serotonin.

34:21.220 --> 34:23.660
 Serotonin is released from a different site in the brain

34:23.660 --> 34:25.860
 than dopamine and norepinephrine is

34:25.860 --> 34:29.060
 and has a different effect on time perception.

34:29.060 --> 34:32.140
 So just to give you an example of how things like dopamine

34:32.140 --> 34:36.340
 and serotonin can modulate our perception of time,

34:36.340 --> 34:38.940
 I want to focus on a little bit of literature

34:38.940 --> 34:40.460
 that now has been done, unfortunately,

34:40.460 --> 34:43.940
 in animals and humans, and which essentially shows

34:43.940 --> 34:48.940
 that the more dopamine that's released into our brain,

34:49.420 --> 34:52.580
 the more we tend to overestimate the amount of time

34:52.580 --> 34:54.180
 that has just passed.

34:54.180 --> 34:55.060
 Let me repeat that.

34:55.060 --> 34:58.440
 The more dopamine that is released into our brain,

34:58.440 --> 35:02.020
 the more we tend to overestimate how much time has passed.

35:02.020 --> 35:04.940
 These experiments are very straightforward, excuse me,

35:04.940 --> 35:06.980
 and they're very objective, which is really nice,

35:06.980 --> 35:10.580
 which is you can give people or an animal a drug

35:10.580 --> 35:12.780
 that increases the amount of dopamine

35:12.780 --> 35:15.220
 and then ask them to measure off

35:15.220 --> 35:18.420
 without any measurement device like a watch or a clock

35:18.420 --> 35:20.860
 when one minute has passed.

35:20.860 --> 35:23.540
 As dopamine levels rise in the brain,

35:23.540 --> 35:28.540
 people tend to think that the minute is up before a minute.

35:28.740 --> 35:31.100
 So at the 38-second mark, they'll say,

35:31.100 --> 35:32.140
 okay, I think a minute is up.

35:32.140 --> 35:35.960
 So they've overestimated how much time has passed, okay?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.540
 The higher the level of dopamine,

35:37.540 --> 35:39.680
 the more people tend to overestimate.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.140
 Now, it's also true that norepinephrine,

35:43.140 --> 35:45.400
 also called noradrenaline, plays a role,

35:45.400 --> 35:47.980
 and its role is very similar to that of dopamine.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.900
 And that's because norepinephrine and dopamine

35:49.900 --> 35:51.020
 are close cousins.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.820
 As some of you may recall,

35:52.820 --> 35:56.420
 that they are actually manufactured from one another, okay?

35:56.420 --> 36:00.380
 So dopamine can actually make epinephrine and norepinephrine

36:00.380 --> 36:02.100
 biochemically.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.740
 There's a cascade in which dopamine can be made

36:04.740 --> 36:07.980
 into norepinephrine and epinephrine, which is remarkable.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.960
 How does having elevated levels of dopamine

36:09.960 --> 36:12.700
 and norepinephrine cause one to overestimate

36:12.700 --> 36:14.540
 how much time has passed?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.820
 Well, it does it because of the way

36:16.820 --> 36:21.340
 that it causes fine slicing of your time bins.

36:21.340 --> 36:24.400
 So fine slicing of time bins is like increasing

36:24.400 --> 36:27.220
 the frame rate on your camera, right?

36:27.220 --> 36:32.220
 Slow motion is achieved in movies and elsewhere

36:32.260 --> 36:34.420
 by increasing the frame rate.

36:34.420 --> 36:38.300
 So if you take a movie at 30 frames per second

36:38.300 --> 36:41.140
 and watch it, it will appear to have a certain speed, right?

36:41.140 --> 36:44.700
 Because those are just snapshots, 30 frames per second.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.220
 In contrast, if you took that same movie

36:47.220 --> 36:50.500
 at 4,000 frames per second, you are fine slicing,

36:50.500 --> 36:51.780
 and you're going to see every little detail.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.780
 And as you play each one of those frames,

36:53.780 --> 36:56.980
 it's going to look like it moved slower, okay?

36:56.980 --> 36:59.540
 Whatever, so the kind of jump shot in basketball

36:59.540 --> 37:03.060
 that's done slowly, any slow motion is the consequence

37:03.060 --> 37:04.780
 of higher frame rate.

37:04.780 --> 37:09.340
 So dopamine and norepinephrine increase frame rate.

37:09.340 --> 37:12.420
 And as a consequence, they tend to lead us

37:12.420 --> 37:15.520
 to overestimate the amount of time that's passed.

37:16.620 --> 37:21.100
 Conversely, the neuromodulator serotonin causes people

37:21.100 --> 37:24.560
 to underestimate the amount of time that's passed.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.220
 So they've done these experiments.

37:26.220 --> 37:29.240
 They actually have done these experiments using in humans

37:29.240 --> 37:30.820
 with drugs that increase serotonin.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.620
 They've also done them with cannabis,

37:32.620 --> 37:34.820
 which increases serotonin among other things,

37:34.820 --> 37:38.940
 including the cannabinoid receptor activation.

37:38.940 --> 37:43.220
 And when people have elevated levels of 5-HT

37:43.220 --> 37:44.980
 or whether or not they've ingested cannabis,

37:44.980 --> 37:47.540
 they tend to underestimate how much time has passed.

37:47.540 --> 37:48.660
 You do the equivalent experiment.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.060
 You tell people that they have to guess

37:51.060 --> 37:54.380
 or tell you when five minutes, for instance, has passed,

37:54.380 --> 37:56.500
 just to use five minutes as an example this time.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.480
 And generally they will miss the five-minute mark.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.900
 They will think, they'll let six minutes pass

38:01.900 --> 38:03.400
 and they'll say, okay, it was five minutes,

38:03.400 --> 38:06.140
 and they've underestimated how much time has passed.

38:06.140 --> 38:08.820
 And that's because serotonin

38:08.820 --> 38:11.200
 and some of the related molecules in the brain

38:11.200 --> 38:15.320
 tend to lead to slower frame rates, right?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.900
 They take the frame rate from, in the example I used before,

38:17.900 --> 38:19.300
 from 4,000 frames per second

38:19.300 --> 38:22.300
 down to say 20 frames per second.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.340
 So this is very interesting.

38:25.260 --> 38:28.400
 It's interesting in terms of how pharmacology can be used

38:28.400 --> 38:29.700
 to adjust time perception,

38:29.700 --> 38:32.100
 but it's also interesting in the context

38:32.100 --> 38:34.260
 of that circadian rhythm.

38:34.260 --> 38:35.860
 There's some emerging evidence

38:35.860 --> 38:38.380
 that throughout the 24-hour cycle,

38:38.380 --> 38:39.900
 there are robust changes

38:39.900 --> 38:42.380
 in the amount of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin

38:42.380 --> 38:45.680
 that are present in the brain and bloodstream and body,

38:45.680 --> 38:50.680
 depending on time of day within the circadian cycle.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.700
 Now, I'm not talking about during sleep.

38:53.700 --> 38:55.640
 During sleep, there are definitely variations

38:55.640 --> 38:57.720
 in things like dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.040
 I talked about that in the episodes on sleep.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.360
 Here, I'm just talking about the role of these molecules

39:03.360 --> 39:05.900
 in time perception during wakefulness.

39:05.900 --> 39:09.080
 So much of the evidence points to the fact

39:09.080 --> 39:11.000
 that in the first half of the day,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.960
 approximate first half of the day,

39:12.960 --> 39:15.080
 dopamine and norepinephrine are elevated

39:15.080 --> 39:17.280
 in the brain, body, and bloodstream

39:17.280 --> 39:19.840
 much more than is serotonin.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.360
 And that in the second half of the day,

39:21.360 --> 39:23.080
 and in particular towards evening and nighttime,

39:23.080 --> 39:25.480
 serotonin levels are going up.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.800
 I think that's fairly well-established now.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.440
 What that means, based on what we just discussed

39:30.440 --> 39:32.760
 about the role of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin

39:32.760 --> 39:36.220
 in setting the frame rate of time perception,

39:36.220 --> 39:38.940
 is that our perception of the passage of time

39:38.940 --> 39:41.360
 will be very different in the early part of the day

39:41.360 --> 39:43.360
 and in the latter half of the day.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.060
 And there's starting to be some evidence to support this,

39:46.060 --> 39:49.540
 that early in the day, people tend to overestimate

39:49.540 --> 39:51.080
 how much time has passed.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.120
 And later in the day, they tend to underestimate

39:53.120 --> 39:54.000
 how much time has passed.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.200
 And this is independent of taking any kind of substance

39:56.200 --> 39:59.200
 that would increase or decrease dopamine or serotonin.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.960
 Now, this is important in terms of how one thinks

40:01.960 --> 40:03.160
 about structuring their day,

40:03.160 --> 40:05.200
 because I know many people are thinking about

40:05.200 --> 40:07.000
 the various tasks that they need to do

40:07.000 --> 40:08.760
 throughout their day.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.200
 Many, or I should say all of the literature at least

40:12.200 --> 40:15.400
 that I can find on productivity and things of that sort

40:15.400 --> 40:18.860
 point to the idea that we should be doing the hardest task,

40:18.860 --> 40:20.460
 the thing that we want to do the least

40:20.460 --> 40:23.440
 or the most important task early in the day

40:23.440 --> 40:26.780
 as a kind of a psychological tool for getting it done

40:26.780 --> 40:28.680
 and feeling as if we accomplished something.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.760
 And I think that's an excellent protocol, frankly.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.520
 But I'm not sure it's an excellent protocol

40:33.520 --> 40:37.340
 because of the way that we sense accomplishment,

40:37.340 --> 40:39.760
 or at least it's not only an excellent protocol

40:39.760 --> 40:42.040
 because of the way that we sense accomplishment.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.880
 Another reason to move something that's very hard

40:44.880 --> 40:46.880
 into the early part of the day

40:46.880 --> 40:51.880
 is that if indeed the dopaminergic and noradrenergic circuits

40:52.240 --> 40:54.580
 are more active at that time,

40:54.580 --> 40:57.880
 we are actually in a better position cognitively

40:57.880 --> 40:59.840
 to parse that hard problem

40:59.840 --> 41:03.500
 because of the way that we are able to fine slice

41:03.500 --> 41:04.720
 our perception of time

41:04.720 --> 41:07.840
 and fine slice all the perceptual events outside us.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.960
 So what I'm really saying is that early in the day

41:09.960 --> 41:13.900
 you are a much more high resolution camera, so to speak,

41:13.900 --> 41:15.660
 than you are later in the day.

41:15.660 --> 41:18.840
 Now, different types of tasks and different types of things

41:18.840 --> 41:21.000
 require different frame rates

41:21.000 --> 41:23.120
 or different ways of perceiving time.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.960
 And indeed this also lends itself to a tool

41:25.960 --> 41:29.480
 whereby for activities that involve

41:29.480 --> 41:31.160
 more kind of creative thinking

41:31.160 --> 41:35.480
 that aren't as constrained by particular answers or outcomes

41:35.480 --> 41:38.120
 and in which we need to kind of blend

41:38.120 --> 41:39.880
 different aspects of our memory,

41:39.880 --> 41:43.720
 different aspects of task utilization.

41:43.720 --> 41:47.000
 In other words, for creative works, for brainstorming,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.900
 for things that are a bit more fluid, so to speak,

41:49.900 --> 41:53.400
 the more serotonergic second half of the day

41:53.400 --> 41:55.160
 and because of the way the serotonergic

41:55.160 --> 41:58.440
 second half of the day lends itself to our time perception

41:58.440 --> 42:01.520
 may actually be more beneficial for those sorts of tasks.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.720
 And I'll put a reference to a couple of the studies

42:03.720 --> 42:05.240
 that point to this idea

42:05.240 --> 42:08.340
 that in these higher dopaminergic states,

42:08.340 --> 42:11.800
 we are better at doing certain sorts of tasks.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.520
 And in these more serotonergic states

42:13.520 --> 42:15.840
 we're better at doing other sorts of tasks

42:15.840 --> 42:18.920
 and how the dopamine tends to be earlier in the day

42:18.920 --> 42:21.200
 and the serotonin later in the day, so to speak.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.800
 These are broad, I'm painting with broad strokes here,

42:23.800 --> 42:25.280
 but I think these lend themselves

42:25.280 --> 42:26.720
 to some really excellent tools

42:26.720 --> 42:29.020
 because I think we all understand the value

42:29.020 --> 42:30.880
 of doing something that's hard or challenging

42:30.880 --> 42:31.760
 early in the day,

42:31.760 --> 42:34.580
 but we should ask ourselves harder challenging how?

42:34.580 --> 42:36.960
 What does that task actually really require

42:36.960 --> 42:38.600
 in terms of time perception?

42:38.600 --> 42:40.240
 Some people might appreciate some examples

42:40.240 --> 42:41.360
 of how this might work.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.420
 Basically what I'm saying is

42:42.420 --> 42:44.920
 if you are doing work that involves

42:44.920 --> 42:47.000
 adhering to some rigid rules,

42:47.000 --> 42:51.800
 so math or a recipe or execution of musical scales

42:51.800 --> 42:55.420
 or physical skills or accounting

42:55.420 --> 42:57.560
 or something that requires a lot of precision

42:57.560 --> 43:00.960
 where there's a right and wrong answer and it's hard,

43:00.960 --> 43:02.120
 I would suggest that you do that

43:02.120 --> 43:03.300
 in the early part of the day

43:03.300 --> 43:05.960
 because of the way that dopamine and norepinephrine

43:06.840 --> 43:08.400
 impact time perception.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.680
 You are literally better at slicing up time.

43:11.680 --> 43:15.040
 You are a higher resolution brain during those times

43:15.040 --> 43:17.000
 and so that's going to lend itself better

43:17.000 --> 43:20.740
 to events and demands that require high resolution.

43:20.740 --> 43:22.600
 Whereas in the afternoon,

43:22.600 --> 43:25.200
 in this more of what I'm calling serotonergic state,

43:25.200 --> 43:27.360
 that's when you're going to be better at brainstorming

43:27.360 --> 43:30.140
 and creative works where there's some flexibility

43:30.140 --> 43:33.200
 in terms of how you're batching time and perceiving time

43:33.200 --> 43:36.220
 and there isn't so much rigid oversight

43:36.220 --> 43:37.920
 of a right or wrong answer.

43:37.920 --> 43:40.280
 And as an aside to support what I said,

43:40.280 --> 43:43.400
 but also to take us back to this critical role

43:43.400 --> 43:45.080
 of the circadian rhythm,

43:45.080 --> 43:46.840
 there is a lot of evidence

43:46.840 --> 43:49.240
 that when one's sleep is disrupted,

43:49.240 --> 43:52.000
 when sleep is either too short or is fragmented

43:52.000 --> 43:55.280
 or is not of high enough quality for enough days,

43:55.280 --> 43:57.360
 one of the first things to happen

43:57.360 --> 43:59.680
 is that there is a dysregulation

43:59.680 --> 44:02.240
 of these dopaminergic, neurodegeneric

44:02.240 --> 44:04.000
 and serotonergic states throughout the day.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.760
 They get kind of mish-mashed up.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.460
 It's not that they're a total mess,

44:09.460 --> 44:12.280
 but they aren't as cleanly defined.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.720
 And I think this is one of the reasons

44:13.720 --> 44:17.080
 why when we haven't slept well or we haven't slept enough,

44:17.080 --> 44:19.680
 we tend to feel a little off, like we can't concentrate.

44:19.680 --> 44:22.340
 Part of that lack of concentration is due to other things,

44:22.340 --> 44:24.260
 but part of that concentration could be due to the fact

44:24.260 --> 44:27.200
 that our sense of the passage of time is disrupted.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.560
 So there seems to be some value

44:28.560 --> 44:32.380
 in keeping the dopaminergic, neurodegenergic state

44:32.380 --> 44:34.200
 kind of limited to the early part of the day

44:34.200 --> 44:36.360
 and the serotonergic state, as we're calling it,

44:36.360 --> 44:38.840
 going to push towards the second half of the day.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.840
 Now, there is a version of how dopamine and norepinephrine

44:41.840 --> 44:44.440
 can impact our perception of the passage of time

44:44.440 --> 44:48.960
 in ways that can be very disruptive or even maladaptive.

44:48.960 --> 44:52.960
 And the best example that I'm aware of is trauma.

44:52.960 --> 44:55.640
 Many people who have been in car accidents

44:55.640 --> 44:58.960
 or who have experienced some other form of major trauma

45:00.080 --> 45:02.640
 do what's called overclocking.

45:02.640 --> 45:07.440
 Overclocking is when levels of dopamine and norepinephrine

45:07.440 --> 45:10.420
 increase so much during a particular event,

45:11.480 --> 45:13.920
 our level of alertness has increased so much

45:13.920 --> 45:18.080
 during a given event that we find slice,

45:18.080 --> 45:21.840
 in other words, the frame rate is increased so much so

45:21.840 --> 45:25.960
 that we perceive things as happening in ultra slow motion.

45:25.960 --> 45:30.120
 Now, that might not seem like a bad thing overall,

45:30.120 --> 45:33.800
 but the problem with overclocking is the way

45:33.800 --> 45:35.960
 in which that information gets stamped down

45:35.960 --> 45:37.660
 into the memory system.

45:37.660 --> 45:40.740
 So the memory system, which involves areas of the brain,

45:40.740 --> 45:43.560
 like the hippocampus, but also the neocortex,

45:43.560 --> 45:46.420
 is basically a space-time recorder.

45:46.420 --> 45:48.120
 What do I mean by space-time recorder?

45:48.120 --> 45:50.400
 Well, your nervous system, of course,

45:50.400 --> 45:52.960
 is housed in the darkness of your skull.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.460
 It doesn't have a whole lot of information

45:54.460 --> 45:55.360
 about the outside world,

45:55.360 --> 45:56.920
 except light coming in through the eyes

45:56.920 --> 45:58.640
 and whatever happens to hit our ears

45:58.640 --> 46:02.280
 in terms of sound waves and skin and so forth.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.080
 So it has to take all those neural signals

46:04.080 --> 46:07.400
 and it has to create a record of what happened.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.640
 Now, it doesn't create a record of everything that happened,

46:09.640 --> 46:13.140
 but car accidents and trauma and things of that sort

46:13.140 --> 46:14.480
 oftentimes are stamped down

46:14.480 --> 46:17.320
 into our record of what happened.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.720
 And what gets stamped down,

46:19.720 --> 46:22.240
 what we actually mean by the phrase stamped down,

46:22.240 --> 46:25.760
 is that the precise firing of the sequence of neurons

46:25.760 --> 46:28.000
 that reflected some event,

46:28.000 --> 46:29.880
 so let's say I'm in a car accident,

46:29.880 --> 46:31.240
 certain neurons are firing

46:31.240 --> 46:33.200
 because of the flipping of the car

46:33.200 --> 46:35.320
 or there's screams or there's blood

46:35.320 --> 46:37.380
 or things of that sort,

46:37.380 --> 46:42.380
 all of that neural activity gets repeated in the hippocampus

46:43.940 --> 46:46.880
 and then the sequence of the firing of those neurons

46:46.880 --> 46:47.880
 is also remembered.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.760
 So it's not just that neuron one, two, three, four

46:50.760 --> 46:51.880
 fired in that sequence,

46:51.880 --> 46:53.920
 it's also that neuron one, two, three, four

46:53.920 --> 46:55.420
 fired at a particular rate.

46:55.420 --> 46:57.920
 So it would be one, two, three, four during the actual event

46:57.920 --> 46:59.520
 and then the memory is stored

46:59.520 --> 47:02.360
 as firing of those neurons as one, two, three, four, right?

47:02.360 --> 47:05.020
 If during the event it was one, two, three, four

47:05.020 --> 47:05.960
 at that rate,

47:05.960 --> 47:09.860
 the storage of the memory is not going to be one,

47:10.720 --> 47:12.500
 two, three, four, okay?

47:12.500 --> 47:15.680
 In other words, there's both a space code as we say,

47:15.680 --> 47:18.640
 meaning the particular neurons that fire is important

47:18.640 --> 47:19.920
 and there's a rate code,

47:19.920 --> 47:23.840
 how quickly those neurons fire or the relative firing,

47:23.840 --> 47:25.560
 the timing of the firing of those neurons

47:25.560 --> 47:26.880
 is also part of the memory.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.280
 This affords our memory system tremendous flexibility.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.760
 What it means is that you can take the same set of neurons

47:31.760 --> 47:35.560
 in the hippocampus and stamp down many, many more memories

47:35.560 --> 47:39.540
 because all you have to do is use a match

47:39.540 --> 47:41.800
 of the different rates of the different neurons

47:41.800 --> 47:44.920
 that were firing in order to set that code, right?

47:44.920 --> 47:46.860
 Otherwise, if you needed a different set of neurons

47:46.860 --> 47:49.000
 for every memory, you need an enormous hippocampus,

47:49.000 --> 47:50.180
 you need an enormous head.

47:50.180 --> 47:52.460
 So I think you get the basic idea.

47:52.460 --> 47:56.960
 Overclocking is a case in which the frame rate is so high

47:56.960 --> 47:59.140
 that a memory gets stamped down

47:59.140 --> 48:01.560
 and people have a very hard time shaking that memory

48:01.560 --> 48:03.840
 and the emotions associated with that memory.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.040
 And it's not the topic of today's conversation,

48:06.040 --> 48:09.080
 but we will cover trauma in a future episode in detail,

48:09.080 --> 48:13.320
 but many of the treatments for trauma, EMDR,

48:13.320 --> 48:14.840
 nowadays there's a lot of excitement also

48:14.840 --> 48:18.900
 about ketamine therapies, exposure therapies,

48:18.900 --> 48:20.760
 like cognitive behavioral therapies,

48:20.760 --> 48:23.920
 involve not just trying to reduce the amount of emotion

48:23.920 --> 48:25.240
 associated with a memory,

48:25.240 --> 48:28.320
 but also a deliberate speeding up

48:28.320 --> 48:30.360
 or slowing down of that memory.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.880
 In other words, trying to allow the person

48:32.880 --> 48:34.780
 who experienced the trauma to take control

48:34.780 --> 48:38.200
 of the rate of the experience in their memory,

48:38.200 --> 48:41.040
 not just whether or not the memory happened at all.

48:41.040 --> 48:44.640
 In fact, one of the first things that trauma victims learn

48:44.640 --> 48:47.340
 is that they aren't going to forget what happened.

48:47.340 --> 48:48.840
 What's eventually going to happen,

48:48.840 --> 48:50.580
 ideally with good treatment,

48:50.580 --> 48:53.760
 is that the emotional weight of the experience

48:53.760 --> 48:56.040
 will eventually be divorced

48:56.040 --> 48:57.960
 from the memory of the experience.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.840
 And that's done again by trying to reduce the amount

49:00.840 --> 49:03.880
 of emotional activation during the recall of that experience

49:03.880 --> 49:05.600
 and one of the best ways to do that

49:05.600 --> 49:10.020
 is to alter the rate of the memory playback.

49:10.020 --> 49:12.020
 In other words, taking that firing of neurons

49:12.020 --> 49:14.240
 that might've been one, two, three, four,

49:14.240 --> 49:15.880
 again, it would be much more complicated,

49:15.880 --> 49:17.720
 but one, two, three, four for the car crash,

49:17.720 --> 49:20.360
 and getting the memory to play back at a rate

49:20.360 --> 49:23.120
 of one, two, three, four,

49:23.120 --> 49:27.360
 or even one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

49:27.360 --> 49:29.920
 In other words, allowing the person

49:29.920 --> 49:32.640
 or instructing the person to take control

49:32.640 --> 49:33.920
 of the rate of the playback.

49:33.920 --> 49:35.800
 And in that way, there seems to be

49:35.800 --> 49:37.560
 still yet unknown mechanism

49:37.560 --> 49:41.700
 by which people can uncouple some of the emotional weight

49:41.700 --> 49:43.480
 that's associated with that memory.

49:43.480 --> 49:48.400
 So overclocking is a kind of extreme example

49:48.400 --> 49:51.120
 of where the dopaminergic and the noradrenergic system

49:51.120 --> 49:54.280
 is ramped up so high that people have this,

49:54.280 --> 49:56.660
 unfortunately, what seems like indelible mark

49:56.660 --> 49:58.400
 in their brain of a particular event.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.000
 But again, trauma treatment is designed

50:00.000 --> 50:02.560
 to uncouple the emotional load of that event.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.880
 Some of you are probably saying, why dopamine during trauma?

50:05.880 --> 50:08.320
 I thought dopamine was the feel-good molecule.

50:08.320 --> 50:12.040
 Well, in reality, dopamine is not necessarily

50:12.040 --> 50:13.120
 a molecule of reward.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.080
 It's a molecule of motivation, pursuit, and drive.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.800
 And because of the close relationship

50:17.800 --> 50:19.520
 between dopamine and norepinephrine,

50:19.520 --> 50:21.560
 oftentimes they are co-released.

50:21.560 --> 50:25.000
 So whether or not dopamine is released during car crashes

50:25.000 --> 50:27.140
 or other forms of trauma, we don't know.

50:27.140 --> 50:29.620
 But what we do know is that both the dopamine system

50:29.620 --> 50:31.040
 and the noradrenergic system,

50:31.040 --> 50:33.260
 when we say noradrenergic, we mean norepinephrine,

50:33.260 --> 50:35.200
 those systems are greatly increased

50:35.200 --> 50:37.600
 anytime there's a heightened state of arousal.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.880
 And arousal can have negative valence,

50:39.880 --> 50:43.160
 like a meaning associated with an event that we really hate

50:43.160 --> 50:45.080
 that we would prefer not to be involved in,

50:45.080 --> 50:47.040
 or it can have positive valence.

50:47.040 --> 50:48.640
 But dopamine and norepinephrine

50:48.640 --> 50:50.680
 are kind of the common hallmark

50:50.680 --> 50:53.440
 of all things of elevated arousal.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.400
 And so that's why we see evidence for dopamine

50:56.400 --> 50:59.200
 being associated with these changes in time perception,

50:59.200 --> 51:03.020
 both for positive events and for negative events.

51:03.020 --> 51:04.880
 There's a very interesting relationship

51:04.880 --> 51:09.880
 between arousal, dopamine, time perception, and blinking.

51:09.940 --> 51:13.360
 And this is all supported by a really interesting paper.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.760
 First author Terhune is the last name, T-E-R-H-U-N-E,

51:16.760 --> 51:19.300
 is published in Current Biology, Cell Press Journal.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.240
 Excellent journal.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.080
 The title of the paper is

51:21.080 --> 51:24.100
 Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking.

51:24.100 --> 51:25.360
 So heightened states of arousal

51:25.360 --> 51:27.220
 are associated with heightened levels of dopamine.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.180
 You now know that dopamine leads

51:29.180 --> 51:32.440
 to a kind of fine slicing of time.

51:32.440 --> 51:36.240
 And one of the ways that we fine slice time is by blinking.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.180
 You know, we think of blinking

51:37.180 --> 51:39.040
 as just a thing to like lubricate our eyes

51:39.040 --> 51:41.440
 or to limit the amount of light coming into our eyes,

51:41.440 --> 51:44.020
 but it's a shutter on our experience.

51:44.020 --> 51:45.500
 So much of the information

51:45.500 --> 51:47.000
 that coming into the brain through our eyes

51:47.000 --> 51:47.960
 impacts our attention.

51:47.960 --> 51:49.500
 I've said it before on this podcast

51:49.500 --> 51:51.760
 that cognitive attention follows visual attention,

51:51.760 --> 51:53.700
 at least for sighted individuals.

51:53.700 --> 51:57.920
 Well, it turns out that dopamine and increases in dopamine

51:57.920 --> 52:01.320
 are associated with increases in spontaneous blink rate.

52:01.320 --> 52:05.000
 So the more aroused we are, the more awake we are.

52:05.000 --> 52:05.840
 There are a number of effects,

52:05.840 --> 52:08.080
 pupils dilate, heart rate increases, et cetera,

52:08.080 --> 52:09.980
 but also blink rate increases.

52:09.980 --> 52:13.240
 And every time we blink, this study cleanly shows,

52:14.320 --> 52:16.040
 we shift our perception of time,

52:16.040 --> 52:20.280
 leading to, as I mentioned before, overestimations of time.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.520
 So it seems as though in some way,

52:22.520 --> 52:25.720
 blink rate is actually related to frame rate.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.840
 And so this is very, very interesting.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.160
 And the way that you could think about leveraging this

52:30.160 --> 52:33.960
 would be if you wanted to actually slow down

52:33.960 --> 52:36.880
 your perception of time, you would blink less.

52:36.880 --> 52:39.440
 And if you want to speed up your perception of time,

52:39.440 --> 52:40.440
 you would blink more.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.200
 Now you'd have to think of a scenario

52:42.200 --> 52:44.200
 in which that would be useful to you.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.120
 Obviously, if you're going to blink,

52:45.120 --> 52:46.920
 you're going to miss things as well.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.780
 But I think it's a very interesting parameter

52:49.780 --> 52:53.140
 of our visual attention as it relates to time perception,

52:53.140 --> 52:54.720
 because what it really speaks to

52:54.720 --> 52:57.820
 is that these neuromodulators like dopamine or serotonin

52:57.820 --> 52:58.800
 that adjust frame rate,

52:58.800 --> 53:01.300
 they're not doing it through some magical mechanism.

53:01.300 --> 53:03.500
 In fact, there's no single brain area

53:03.500 --> 53:06.140
 that we can say controls time perception.

53:06.140 --> 53:08.880
 I haven't said today, oh, you know, it's the striatum.

53:08.880 --> 53:10.440
 Well, it involves the striatum,

53:10.440 --> 53:12.240
 but I'm not going to say, for instance,

53:12.240 --> 53:13.340
 oh, it's the cerebellum.

53:13.340 --> 53:16.800
 The cerebellum is definitely involved in timing of movement,

53:16.800 --> 53:18.600
 something for a future podcast,

53:18.600 --> 53:22.360
 but time perception is what we call a distributed phenomenon.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.420
 It's a network of areas in the brain working together,

53:25.420 --> 53:28.080
 but dopamine in the way that it relates

53:28.080 --> 53:30.960
 to the shuttering of your eyes

53:30.960 --> 53:34.360
 seems to be controlling the frame rate on your experience.

53:34.360 --> 53:35.800
 Numerous times on this podcast,

53:35.800 --> 53:37.480
 I've talked about cold exposure,

53:37.480 --> 53:39.240
 and nowadays there's a lot of interest

53:39.240 --> 53:43.400
 in things like cold showers, ice baths, submersion

53:43.400 --> 53:45.600
 in cold water tanks and, you know,

53:45.600 --> 53:47.880
 lakes and oceans and things of that sort.

53:47.880 --> 53:49.780
 There are a lot of different positive effects

53:49.780 --> 53:51.400
 of cold exposure.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.480
 Provided it's done properly,

53:52.480 --> 53:55.160
 it can lead to increases in metabolism, brown fat stores,

53:55.160 --> 53:56.800
 which are the good fat stores that you want.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.520
 They're sort of like a furnace

53:58.520 --> 53:59.700
 that allow you to heat yourself up,

53:59.700 --> 54:03.760
 stay warm in cold environments to reduce inflammation,

54:03.760 --> 54:05.600
 to increase resilience and so forth.

54:06.920 --> 54:08.640
 There's a study published in the European Journal

54:08.640 --> 54:11.520
 of Physiology showing that cold exposure

54:11.520 --> 54:16.040
 can increase our baseline levels of dopamine robustly, 2.5X,

54:16.040 --> 54:18.080
 and it's a long lasting increase in dopamine

54:18.080 --> 54:19.300
 and appears to be a healthy one,

54:19.300 --> 54:20.960
 meaning it doesn't seem to be addictive.

54:20.960 --> 54:23.040
 I'm sure there are some people out there addicted to ice baths

54:23.040 --> 54:24.920
 but, you know, when you think about the range

54:24.920 --> 54:27.400
 of dopamine inducing behaviors that are addictive,

54:27.400 --> 54:30.740
 that seems to be more on the health promoting side.

54:30.740 --> 54:33.640
 What's interesting is that because cold water exposure

54:33.640 --> 54:34.800
 increases dopamine,

54:34.800 --> 54:36.880
 it will also change your perception of time.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.960
 And if you've ever done one of these cold water exposures,

54:38.960 --> 54:40.420
 you've experienced this,

54:40.420 --> 54:42.440
 you've experienced getting in and feeling like,

54:42.440 --> 54:45.920
 wow, making it three minutes is a really, really long time.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.560
 And you are fine slicing time,

54:47.560 --> 54:49.000
 your frame rate is going up.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.400
 Part of that, just at a kind of a course level

54:52.400 --> 54:54.600
 as you're thinking, this is painful, I don't like this,

54:54.600 --> 54:56.400
 I want to get out, right?

54:56.400 --> 54:58.880
 But part of it is also that your dopamine levels

54:58.880 --> 55:00.360
 are going up very quickly,

55:00.360 --> 55:03.300
 and therefore your perception of that discomfort

55:03.300 --> 55:05.200
 is also being fine sliced.

55:05.200 --> 55:07.800
 And so you could leverage a tool, for instance,

55:07.800 --> 55:10.040
 where you try and entrain your thinking

55:10.040 --> 55:12.960
 to something other than your immediate experience, right?

55:12.960 --> 55:15.760
 This is a kind of a controversy, if you will,

55:15.760 --> 55:18.420
 in the cold exposure world.

55:18.420 --> 55:21.360
 The question is, do you try and lean into the experience

55:21.360 --> 55:22.860
 and really feel it?

55:22.860 --> 55:24.880
 Or do you try and distract yourself, you know,

55:24.880 --> 55:29.140
 sing a song or count off, you know, from one to 100?

55:30.520 --> 55:32.640
 Just know that whatever tactic you use

55:32.640 --> 55:34.920
 to get through the cold exposure,

55:34.920 --> 55:38.680
 that the dopamine level that's now increased in your system

55:38.680 --> 55:41.280
 is going to cause you to fine slice

55:41.280 --> 55:44.060
 or experience that at slow motion.

55:44.060 --> 55:46.320
 So a minute is going to seem like a lot longer

55:46.320 --> 55:48.960
 than a minute in reality.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.480
 So you could, for instance, decide to pay attention

55:52.480 --> 55:55.060
 to some external cue.

55:55.060 --> 55:59.520
 Maybe it's a metronome that ticks once every 10 seconds.

55:59.520 --> 56:02.320
 You could decide to think about something else.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.320
 You could decide to sing a song in your head

56:04.320 --> 56:05.760
 or sing a song out loud.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.360
 All of that will divorce you

56:07.360 --> 56:09.520
 from the sensation that you're experienced somewhat,

56:09.520 --> 56:11.840
 but more so it will divorce you

56:11.840 --> 56:14.720
 from the perception of your experience

56:14.720 --> 56:17.640
 as governed by that dopamine increase in frame rate.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.780
 If that isn't clear, just know this.

56:19.780 --> 56:21.960
 When you're in the ice bath, your dopamine levels are high.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.720
 When your dopamine levels are high,

56:23.720 --> 56:26.080
 your experience of the discomfort of that ice bath

56:26.080 --> 56:28.200
 is at higher resolution.

56:28.200 --> 56:31.200
 Now, up until now, I've been talking about how dopamine

56:31.200 --> 56:35.200
 and to some extent serotonin can differentially impact

56:35.200 --> 56:39.040
 your perception of how fast or how slowly things

56:39.040 --> 56:41.300
 are happening in the moment.

56:41.300 --> 56:43.800
 But remember, we have prospective time,

56:43.800 --> 56:46.120
 we have our experience of time in the moment,

56:46.120 --> 56:48.360
 and we have retrospective time.

56:48.360 --> 56:51.160
 And there are beautiful studies that have showed

56:51.160 --> 56:56.040
 that the dopaminergic state changes the way,

56:56.040 --> 56:58.380
 not just that we experience things now,

56:58.380 --> 57:02.360
 but that it changes the way in which we remember things

57:02.360 --> 57:05.560
 in the past and the rate at which those things occurred,

57:05.560 --> 57:08.080
 and those are in opposite direction.

57:08.080 --> 57:10.720
 So to make this very simple,

57:10.720 --> 57:15.520
 if something that you experience is fun or varied,

57:15.520 --> 57:18.600
 meaning it has a lot of different components in it,

57:18.600 --> 57:21.600
 and is, in other words, is associated with an increase

57:21.600 --> 57:23.060
 in dopamine in your brain,

57:23.060 --> 57:28.060
 you will experience that as going by very fast.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.780
 Now, this is different than the ice bath,

57:30.780 --> 57:32.980
 which I just said you experience as going by very slowly,

57:32.980 --> 57:35.500
 but here I'm talking about something that's fun and varied

57:35.500 --> 57:36.660
 that you really like,

57:36.660 --> 57:38.780
 and you'll feel like it goes by very, very fast.

57:38.780 --> 57:42.280
 Imagine an amazing day for a kid in an amusement park.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.280
 They can do a ton of things, it's all new,

57:44.280 --> 57:45.740
 they're very excited,

57:45.740 --> 57:48.380
 and they'll feel like it goes by very fast.

57:48.380 --> 57:52.220
 But later, they will remember that experience

57:52.220 --> 57:54.580
 as being very long,

57:54.580 --> 57:57.540
 that it was a long day full of many, many events.

57:57.540 --> 58:00.340
 And so there's this paradoxical relationship

58:00.340 --> 58:03.440
 between how we perceive fun, exciting, varied events

58:03.440 --> 58:06.200
 in the present and how we remember them in the past.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.340
 For those of you who have gone on vacation,

58:08.340 --> 58:10.040
 if you've had an amazing day on vacation,

58:10.040 --> 58:12.280
 it'll seem like, or an amazing vacation overall,

58:12.280 --> 58:14.180
 it will seem like it goes by very fast.

58:14.180 --> 58:15.420
 The last day of vacation, you sort of go,

58:15.420 --> 58:18.680
 whoa, it went by so fast because there's so much happening.

58:18.680 --> 58:21.080
 But in memory, six to eight months later,

58:21.080 --> 58:24.780
 you'll remember, wow, that just went,

58:24.780 --> 58:26.940
 that was a long, long thing.

58:26.940 --> 58:28.980
 We had this, then we had that, then we did this,

58:28.980 --> 58:29.820
 then we had that.

58:29.820 --> 58:32.740
 It tends to spool out in a longer memory

58:32.740 --> 58:34.740
 than the actual experience.

58:34.740 --> 58:37.940
 Conversely, if you are bored with something

58:38.980 --> 58:40.280
 or it's something you really don't like,

58:40.280 --> 58:43.680
 it's going to seem like it takes a long time

58:43.680 --> 58:46.180
 to go through that experience in the moment.

58:46.180 --> 58:48.060
 But retroactively, looking back,

58:48.060 --> 58:50.260
 it will seem like that moment was very short.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.940
 So if the other day I was waiting in the waiting room

58:52.940 --> 58:54.800
 for the dentist, it was pretty boring.

58:54.800 --> 58:55.940
 I was just kind of sitting there.

58:55.940 --> 58:57.740
 There wasn't much going on.

58:57.740 --> 59:00.040
 And it did seem like it was going on an awfully long time.

59:00.040 --> 59:01.820
 But indeed, looking back, it just seems like,

59:01.820 --> 59:03.980
 okay, I sat in that room, not much happened.

59:03.980 --> 59:05.620
 And so it seems like a very short time been.

59:05.620 --> 59:07.380
 This seems to be an efficiency

59:07.380 --> 59:09.240
 of how the brain stores information.

59:10.580 --> 59:12.320
 Dopamine being associated, of course,

59:12.320 --> 59:14.380
 with fun and varied experiences

59:14.380 --> 59:17.600
 and low dopamine being associated with kind of empty,

59:17.600 --> 59:22.020
 boring or what at the time seemed like long experiences.

59:22.020 --> 59:24.420
 And this whole thing has been stamped down

59:24.420 --> 59:27.620
 into the scientific literature by those earlier experiments

59:27.620 --> 59:28.620
 where they take human beings

59:28.620 --> 59:30.820
 and isolate them in certain environments,

59:30.820 --> 59:33.380
 take away all the clocks and watches and cues

59:33.380 --> 59:35.420
 and about what time of day it is

59:35.420 --> 59:36.700
 and what time of night it is

59:36.700 --> 59:38.980
 and allow people to have a life

59:38.980 --> 59:42.180
 where they can either read and work and do things

59:42.180 --> 59:44.140
 or where they have very little to do.

59:44.140 --> 59:47.580
 When people are isolated in very boring environments

59:47.580 --> 59:51.420
 and they don't have access to time cues, time dilates.

59:51.420 --> 59:55.860
 They tend to assume that time has gone on very, very long.

59:55.860 --> 59:58.100
 And so the reason I bring this up is

59:58.100 --> 1:00:00.460
 we aren't just driven by the circadian clocks

1:00:00.460 --> 1:00:03.700
 and the circannual clocks and these ultradian clocks.

1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:06.880
 We are driven by these timers

1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:10.660
 that vary depending on our level of excitement.

1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:13.480
 And they vary depending on our level of excitement

1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:16.100
 because of these neuromodulators, dopamine and serotonin.

1:00:16.100 --> 1:00:17.620
 So the way I like to think about it

1:00:17.620 --> 1:00:20.740
 is that you have two clocks, two stopwatches.

1:00:20.740 --> 1:00:23.220
 One is a dopaminergic stopwatch

1:00:23.220 --> 1:00:25.200
 that fine slices really closely.

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:26.740
 It's like counts off milliseconds

1:00:26.740 --> 1:00:28.820
 and it's grabbing a movie of your experience

1:00:28.820 --> 1:00:30.180
 at very high resolution.

1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:33.260
 And then the other hand, you have a stopwatch

1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:34.860
 that's gathering big time bins,

1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:39.860
 big ticks along the hand is moving at bigger intervals,

1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:41.440
 marking off time.

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:44.540
 And depending on whether or not you're excited

1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:45.700
 or whether or not you're bored,

1:00:45.700 --> 1:00:48.740
 you're using different stopwatches on time

1:00:48.740 --> 1:00:51.980
 and therefore you're perceiving your experience differently.

1:00:51.980 --> 1:00:54.000
 One very interesting aspect to the way

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.180
 that neuromodulators like dopamine and novelty

1:00:58.180 --> 1:01:00.740
 interact with time perception and memory

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:05.640
 is how we perceive our relationship to places and people.

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:08.380
 So really interesting literature

1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:11.560
 showing that the more novel experiences we have in a place,

1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:16.580
 the more we feel we know that place, obviously,

1:01:16.580 --> 1:01:19.420
 but the longer we feel we've been there.

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.780
 So here's the kind of gedanken or thought experiment

1:01:21.780 --> 1:01:24.280
 that illustrates what's in the literature.

1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:25.900
 Let's say I were to move to New York City.

1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:27.200
 I happen to really like New York City.

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:29.540
 I've never lived there, but let's say I lived there.

1:01:29.540 --> 1:01:32.320
 I lived in a given apartment for a year

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.380
 and I would have a number of different experiences

1:01:34.380 --> 1:01:35.680
 in this mental experiment.

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:40.680
 Let's say I had 100 different exciting and new experiences.

1:01:41.980 --> 1:01:44.120
 I would, at the end of that year,

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:46.900
 feel as if I lived there a certain period of time, one year.

1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:48.560
 I would actually know I lived there one year.

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:50.540
 If, however, I lived in three different places

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:53.260
 in New York City and I met three times as many people

1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:56.240
 and I had three times as many novel experiences,

1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:59.800
 I would actually feel as if I had been there much longer

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:01.980
 than had I only lived in one location.

1:02:01.980 --> 1:02:04.580
 This is also true for social interactions.

1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:09.580
 When we move to multiple or several novel environments

1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:12.420
 with somebody else, we tend to feel as if we know

1:02:12.420 --> 1:02:14.860
 that person much better and that they know us much better.

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:16.700
 Now, of course, we get the opportunity to interact

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:18.180
 with those people in different contexts.

1:02:18.180 --> 1:02:21.140
 And so, indeed, we do get the opportunity to see them,

1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:24.100
 for instance, at the coffee shop, how they order coffee,

1:02:24.100 --> 1:02:27.320
 you maybe go to a sports event, how they act there,

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:29.100
 maybe how they interact with your family.

1:02:29.100 --> 1:02:32.040
 You're getting a sense of them in different contexts.

1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:34.680
 That's certainly playing a role,

1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:37.760
 but it seems as if the more novelty you experience

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:41.040
 with somebody, not only the more familiar they are to you,

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.420
 but the more time you feel you've spent with them,

1:02:43.420 --> 1:02:45.020
 even though the total amount of time

1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:46.500
 can be exactly the same.

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:48.620
 And so that's a very interesting aspect

1:02:48.620 --> 1:02:51.180
 of how our perception of time and these neuromodulators

1:02:51.180 --> 1:02:53.020
 and novelty can shape the way,

1:02:53.020 --> 1:02:56.900
 not just that we perceive a given event in our world,

1:02:56.900 --> 1:02:59.940
 but how we relate to a place or relate to a person.

1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:02.860
 So we've talked a lot about the different neurochemicals

1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:04.740
 and how those neurochemicals can influence

1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:06.020
 our perception of time.

1:03:06.020 --> 1:03:08.120
 We haven't talked a lot about the neural circuits

1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:11.220
 and the various areas of the brain that underlie this.

1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:12.340
 I do want to touch on that

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.300
 by highlighting a really wonderful study.

1:03:15.300 --> 1:03:16.940
 This was a study published in Neuron,

1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:19.420
 also a cell press journal, excellent journal.

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:22.380
 The title of the paper is Behavioral, Physiological,

1:03:22.380 --> 1:03:24.760
 and Neural Signatures of Surprise

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.020
 During Naturalistic Sports Viewing.

1:03:28.020 --> 1:03:29.080
 This experiment is really cool.

1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:31.300
 They did brain imaging on individuals

1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:33.820
 who are watching basketball games.

1:03:33.820 --> 1:03:36.440
 These were basketball games that actually took place,

1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:37.780
 that were recorded.

1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:41.420
 And the subjects watching these basketball games,

1:03:41.420 --> 1:03:43.060
 in some cases, not all,

1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:45.100
 had some interest in who would win or lose.

1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:46.780
 And in some cases, not all,

1:03:46.780 --> 1:03:49.740
 the subjects in these studies had some prior knowledge

1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:51.760
 of which team they thought was better,

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:54.260
 which team was likely to win or not likely to win.

1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:58.260
 The basic findings of the study were that

1:03:58.260 --> 1:04:00.140
 they could measure surprise

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:05.400
 by the release of dopamine in two areas of the brain,

1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:07.440
 part of what are called, is called, excuse me,

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:09.300
 the mesolimbic reward pathway.

1:04:09.300 --> 1:04:10.860
 So the two areas of the brain that are important here

1:04:10.860 --> 1:04:13.340
 are the nucleus accumbens and the VTA,

1:04:13.340 --> 1:04:14.580
 the ventral tegmental area.

1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:17.500
 These are areas that release dopamine

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:19.300
 as kind of a token of reward

1:04:19.300 --> 1:04:21.620
 anytime something is surprising

1:04:21.620 --> 1:04:25.220
 or a positive expectation is met, okay?

1:04:25.220 --> 1:04:28.600
 So if I predict that my team dribbling down court

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.380
 is going to score on this drive

1:04:30.380 --> 1:04:31.940
 and they get the ball in the basket,

1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:33.260
 a little bit of dopamine is released,

1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:37.080
 these two brain areas light up in the functional imaging,

1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:40.260
 so-called FMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging

1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:41.660
 that they used in the study.

1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:44.860
 What's really interesting about this study

1:04:44.860 --> 1:04:47.820
 is not just that dopamine was released

1:04:47.820 --> 1:04:52.060
 anytime that something the subject wanted to see happened,

1:04:52.060 --> 1:04:54.740
 anytime they wanted to see their team score, they scored,

1:04:54.740 --> 1:04:56.620
 but also during surprise.

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:58.740
 So if they thought, for instance,

1:04:58.740 --> 1:05:01.060
 and they would hit a button to predict

1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:03.380
 that their team was going to score on this particular drive

1:05:03.380 --> 1:05:07.140
 and they didn't, well, then dopamine could also be released

1:05:07.140 --> 1:05:09.020
 in response to that surprise.

1:05:09.020 --> 1:05:10.740
 So this speaks again to dopamine

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:12.180
 being something that's important,

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:16.060
 not just for positive events, but for unexpected events.

1:05:16.060 --> 1:05:18.100
 Now that's all very interesting

1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:19.760
 and speaks to the fact that dopamine

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:22.440
 is a kind of flexible currency in the brain.

1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:25.540
 It's doled out, if you will, or released

1:05:25.540 --> 1:05:29.060
 when something that one hopes will happen happens,

1:05:29.060 --> 1:05:31.860
 and it's released when there's a surprise,

1:05:31.860 --> 1:05:33.980
 even if it's kind of a negative surprise,

1:05:33.980 --> 1:05:37.220
 it's not something that the subject wanted to happen.

1:05:37.220 --> 1:05:39.060
 But the more interesting thing

1:05:39.060 --> 1:05:42.200
 is how that relates to time perception.

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:43.740
 What they found was,

1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:46.500
 regardless of what caused the dopamine release,

1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:49.340
 the frequency of dopamine release

1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:53.460
 predicted how the subjects parsed the time bins

1:05:53.460 --> 1:05:55.700
 of the game they were watching.

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:56.660
 What do I mean by that?

1:05:56.660 --> 1:05:58.340
 Well, when you watch a basketball game

1:05:58.340 --> 1:06:00.420
 or you watch anything, children playing

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:02.780
 or talking to your spouse or whatever,

1:06:02.780 --> 1:06:04.740
 you're batching time.

1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:06.500
 How are you batching time?

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:09.580
 Well, you could batch a meal by the, I don't know,

1:06:09.580 --> 1:06:12.180
 the appetizer, the main course, and the dessert,

1:06:12.180 --> 1:06:14.640
 but it turns out that's not what you're doing.

1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:16.340
 You're batching time

1:06:16.340 --> 1:06:19.420
 according to the frequency of dopamine pulses,

1:06:19.420 --> 1:06:21.220
 the frequency of dopamine release.

1:06:21.220 --> 1:06:23.000
 And that's what they saw in this study.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.220
 If they evaluated people's perceptions

1:06:25.220 --> 1:06:26.520
 of the passage of time,

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.260
 what they found is that that matched,

1:06:28.260 --> 1:06:31.920
 not whether or not it was a particular time point

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:32.760
 in the game,

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.900
 not whether or not their team was going down court

1:06:34.900 --> 1:06:37.700
 or running back up court to play defense,

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:42.340
 but the dopamine release served as markers,

1:06:42.340 --> 1:06:44.220
 which would predict the frame rate

1:06:44.220 --> 1:06:45.960
 of their perception of the experience.

1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:47.400
 And if that sounds complicated,

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:50.860
 what I mean is how often and when you release dopamine

1:06:50.860 --> 1:06:53.100
 is actually setting the frame rate

1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:55.780
 on the entire perception of everything,

1:06:55.780 --> 1:06:58.740
 not just for positive events or negative events.

1:06:58.740 --> 1:07:01.380
 So what this means is as you were going through life,

1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:07.800
 dopamine and the release of dopamine is saying that's over

1:07:07.940 --> 1:07:10.120
 and now you're in a new phase of your life,

1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:11.580
 even if it's very short, right?

1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:13.220
 So if I get up in the morning and I'm like,

1:07:13.220 --> 1:07:14.660
 oh, I really need a cup of coffee,

1:07:14.660 --> 1:07:15.980
 as you probably all know,

1:07:15.980 --> 1:07:19.980
 I wait 90 minutes to 120 minutes before I drink my coffee,

1:07:19.980 --> 1:07:20.940
 but then I get my coffee

1:07:20.940 --> 1:07:23.940
 and surely there's a dopamine hit there, I promise you.

1:07:23.940 --> 1:07:27.900
 I actually am starting to carve up my day

1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:29.520
 according to dopamine hits.

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.720
 I am with consciously or subconsciously,

1:07:34.460 --> 1:07:37.000
 I'm actually carving up my experience

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.820
 according to when I'm getting dopamine throughout my day.

1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:43.420
 This governance over our perception of time

1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:47.060
 that dopamine has points to a very clear,

1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:50.500
 very actionable and very powerful tool.

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:53.300
 And that is a tool that many people have talked about before

1:07:53.300 --> 1:07:54.660
 which are habits.

1:07:55.940 --> 1:07:58.700
 People have discussed habits in a variety of contexts,

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:03.700
 but in the context of dopamine reward and time perception,

1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:10.660
 what this means is that placing specific habitual routines

1:08:10.660 --> 1:08:13.620
 at particular intervals throughout your day

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:16.900
 is a very, not just convenient,

1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:20.940
 but a very good way to incorporate the dopamine system

1:08:20.940 --> 1:08:23.300
 so that you divide your day into a series

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:25.100
 of what I would call functional units.

1:08:25.100 --> 1:08:26.180
 What would this look like?

1:08:26.180 --> 1:08:28.520
 It would mean waking up and having one specific habit

1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:33.520
 that you always engage in that causes a release of dopamine.

1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:36.920
 You could say, well, great, that'll make me feel good.

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:38.260
 And I would agree,

1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:41.280
 dopamine release generally makes us feel motivated,

1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:42.960
 but it would have an additional effect

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:45.040
 of marking that time of day

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:47.940
 as the beginning of a particular time bin.

1:08:47.940 --> 1:08:49.640
 Then inserting another habit,

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:51.460
 perhaps the beginning of, I don't know,

1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:53.020
 your breakfast or something,

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:54.780
 but recognizing that that's a habit

1:08:54.780 --> 1:08:56.000
 and being fairly habitual.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.060
 You don't have to be obsessively precise about the timing,

1:09:00.060 --> 1:09:04.460
 but that regular sequencing of things

1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:07.060
 is going to lead not just to dopamine release

1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:09.980
 as it relates to reward and motivation and feeling good,

1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:11.580
 but it actually becomes the way

1:09:11.580 --> 1:09:15.300
 in which we carve up our entire experience of our day.

1:09:15.300 --> 1:09:17.820
 And this is almost a circular argument.

1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:19.760
 You could say, well, of course, I do one thing,

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:21.380
 then I do the next, then I do the next,

1:09:21.380 --> 1:09:23.660
 and that's how I perceive my day.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:27.200
 That's my day, it's my list, it's my to-do list, et cetera.

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.020
 But what I'm saying is that on the basis of this study,

1:09:30.020 --> 1:09:31.180
 I should mention the first author,

1:09:31.180 --> 1:09:34.020
 his last name is Antony, it was Antony et al.

1:09:34.020 --> 1:09:39.020
 It was published in 2020, the study on basketball viewing.

1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:42.780
 What it points to is that by engaging in specific habits

1:09:42.780 --> 1:09:45.040
 that we know we can perform well,

1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:48.300
 we are actually setting the frame rate on our day.

1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:50.560
 And so I think there will soon come a time

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:52.700
 where human beings are not just thinking of,

1:09:52.700 --> 1:09:55.620
 okay, my morning routine and my afternoon routine,

1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:57.700
 I think that can be useful, and in fact,

1:09:57.700 --> 1:10:00.140
 I used or mentioned a structure of that sort

1:10:00.140 --> 1:10:01.520
 earlier in their episode,

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:04.900
 but rather thinking about what's actually going on

1:10:04.900 --> 1:10:07.220
 at the level of our biology,

1:10:07.220 --> 1:10:09.860
 which is that dopamine is marking time.

1:10:09.860 --> 1:10:11.740
 Habits are a very clear way

1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:14.180
 in which we can invoke dopamine release

1:10:14.180 --> 1:10:16.420
 and therefore provide time markers.

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:18.780
 And what this means is that, for instance,

1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:21.100
 during your morning, you might insert habit one

1:10:21.100 --> 1:10:25.180
 and habit two at say, I don't know, 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.,

1:10:25.180 --> 1:10:27.780
 and in doing that, that marks an epoch,

1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:31.620
 a little batch of time in your morning routine

1:10:31.620 --> 1:10:34.500
 that's distinct from the second half of your morning.

1:10:34.500 --> 1:10:38.640
 In other words, habits serve as flankers or markers

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:40.860
 for the passage of your day.

1:10:40.860 --> 1:10:42.720
 Now, if that seems kind of hyper neurotic

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.980
 or why would I want to structure my life like that,

1:10:44.980 --> 1:10:47.540
 I would say that many people would do well

1:10:47.540 --> 1:10:50.380
 to structure their life like that and to utilize habits,

1:10:50.380 --> 1:10:52.800
 not just for sake of what you do during the habit,

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:56.100
 but because of the fact that the habits serve as a marker

1:10:56.100 --> 1:10:58.940
 because of the way they can evoke dopamine release.

1:10:58.940 --> 1:11:02.500
 And in doing that, you're able to segment your day

1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:05.300
 into a bunch of smaller, if you want them to be smaller,

1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:07.380
 or larger functional units.

1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:10.860
 If anyone wants to experiment with this,

1:11:10.860 --> 1:11:12.840
 the Huberman Lab podcast puts out a newsletter.

1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:14.380
 It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.

1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:17.460
 You can sign up for it at hubermanlab.com.

1:11:17.460 --> 1:11:18.460
 We put it out each month.

1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:20.020
 You can see the previous newsletters.

1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:20.960
 They're zero cost.

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:22.360
 We have our privacy statement there.

1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:24.080
 We don't share your email or anything.

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:29.080
 And there you'll find the 12 Steps to Improving Sleep

1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:30.060
 was the first one.

1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:31.680
 There's another, the second newsletter

1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:33.060
 was all about neuroplasticity

1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:34.860
 and using scientific literature

1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:37.300
 to improve learning and teaching.

1:11:37.300 --> 1:11:39.020
 And in the next newsletter,

1:11:39.020 --> 1:11:41.740
 I intend to include a example protocol

1:11:41.740 --> 1:11:43.300
 of how one could use habits

1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:45.940
 and the relationship between habits and dopamine,

1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:48.660
 dopamine and time perception to structure your day

1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:52.060
 according to performance of particular types of tasks.

1:11:52.060 --> 1:11:54.200
 Today, we covered a lot about time perception.

1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:56.340
 We certainly didn't cover everything about time perception,

1:11:56.340 --> 1:11:57.940
 but we covered things like entrainment,

1:11:57.940 --> 1:12:01.180
 the role of dopamine, habits, and various routines

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.400
 that can adjust your sense of time

1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:05.400
 for sake of particular goals.

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:08.460
 If you're interested in learning more about time perception,

1:12:08.460 --> 1:12:10.900
 I'd like to point you to a really excellent book

1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:12.840
 called Your Brain is a Time Machine,

1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:15.260
 the Neuroscience and Physics of Time.

1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:18.060
 The book was written by Professor Dr. Dean Buonamano,

1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:19.480
 who's a professor at UCLA

1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:23.440
 and a world expert in the neuroscience and physics of time.

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:25.580
 I do hope to get Dean on the podcast

1:12:25.580 --> 1:12:27.400
 in the not too distant future.

1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:29.940

 On Instagram, I do short neuroscience tutorials

1:12:56.660 --> 1:12:57.900
 and tools and protocols.

1:12:57.900 --> 1:12:59.400
 I cover recent papers,

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:02.220
 many of which are not included on the podcast.

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:03.500
 We also have a Patreon.

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:06.540
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

1:13:06.540 --> 1:13:08.340
 and there you can support the podcast

1:13:08.340 --> 1:13:10.100
 at any level that you like.

1:13:10.100 --> 1:13:12.340
 Not so much today, but on many previous episodes

1:13:12.340 --> 1:13:15.020
 of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.

1:13:15.020 --> 1:13:17.940
 And while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:13:17.940 --> 1:13:20.220
 many people derive great benefit from supplements

1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:22.840
 for sleep, for focus, and so forth.

1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:24.240
 One issue with supplements, however,

1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:27.120
 is that what's listed on the bottle of various supplements

1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:29.140
 isn't always what's included in the bottle.

1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:31.720
 And the quality of ingredients varies tremendously

1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:34.000
 across different supplement manufacturers.

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.240
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne,

1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:37.900
 that's T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:40.060
 because Thorne supplements have the highest levels

1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:42.240
 of stringency of any supplement company out there

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:43.380
 that we are aware of.

1:13:43.380 --> 1:13:45.500
 They work with all the major sports teams.

1:13:45.500 --> 1:13:46.620
 They work with the Mayo Clinic.

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:48.360
 And so we're delighted that we partnered with them.

1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:50.260
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:51.300
 you can go to Thorne,

1:13:51.300 --> 1:13:55.780
 that's T-H-O-R-N-E dot com slash the letter U slash Huberman

1:13:55.780 --> 1:13:57.140
 to see the supplements that I take,

1:13:57.140 --> 1:13:59.880
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:02.220
 If you enter the Thorne site through that portal,

1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:04.940
 you can also get 20% off any of the supplements

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:06.180
 that Thorne makes.

1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:08.160
 Thank you for your time and attention today.

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:10.340
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:12.300
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:17.300
 I'll see you next time.
