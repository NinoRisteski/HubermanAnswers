00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.320
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.040
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.040 --> 00:15.100
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.100 --> 00:18.780
 This month, we're talking all about disorders of the mind,

00:18.780 --> 00:22.240
 things like depression, attention deficit disorders,

00:22.240 --> 00:25.920
 eating disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.080
 During the course of this month,

00:28.080 --> 00:30.220
 we are going to discuss the psychological

00:30.220 --> 00:34.320
 and biological underpinnings of mood disorders of all kinds.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.920
 You'll learn a lot of science.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.160
 You'll also learn a lot about the various treatments

00:38.160 --> 00:40.720
 that exist and that are in development

00:40.720 --> 00:43.120
 for these various mood disorders.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.520
 We will talk about behavioral tools,

00:45.520 --> 00:49.280
 things like exercise, meditation, breath work,

00:49.280 --> 00:52.080
 but also prescription drugs, supplements,

00:52.080 --> 00:54.420
 and novel compounds that are now being tested

00:54.420 --> 00:56.400
 in various clinical trials.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.460
 Across the month, I think you'll start to realize

00:58.460 --> 00:59.800
 that there are common pathways

00:59.800 --> 01:02.360
 underlying many mood disorders.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.120
 In fact, mood disorders that look quite different

01:05.120 --> 01:08.040
 from one another often depend on the action

01:08.040 --> 01:10.260
 of the same neurochemicals or neural circuits

01:10.260 --> 01:11.920
 in the brain and body.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.420
 That actually should be a point of great relief

01:14.420 --> 01:17.160
 because what it means is that by understanding the biology

01:17.160 --> 01:20.480
 of one mood disorder or understanding how one treatment

01:20.480 --> 01:23.800
 or behavioral intervention can impact a mood disorder,

01:23.800 --> 01:26.800
 we gain insight into other mood disorders as well.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.840
 As always, we will discuss science

01:28.840 --> 01:30.640
 and science-related tools

01:30.640 --> 01:33.200
 that people could implement should they choose.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.660
 Before we dive into today's topic,

01:35.660 --> 01:37.840
 I'd like to discuss a very particular set

01:37.840 --> 01:41.920
 of scientific findings that relate to today's topic

01:41.920 --> 01:45.240
 and that are important for understanding all mood disorders

01:45.240 --> 01:50.240
 and all states of motivation, happiness, and sadness,

01:50.540 --> 01:52.240
 as well as depression.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.020
 Basically, I'm going to paraphrase a brief segment

01:55.020 --> 01:57.840
 of my discussion with Dr. Anna Lemke,

01:57.840 --> 02:00.600
 who I sat down with to discuss addiction

02:00.600 --> 02:02.000
 and the biological basis

02:02.000 --> 02:03.920
 of addiction and addiction treatment.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.720
 A very important aspect of that discussion

02:07.720 --> 02:12.120
 was when Dr. Lemke described the pleasure-pain balance,

02:12.120 --> 02:13.880
 literally the circuits in our brains

02:13.880 --> 02:16.360
 that control our sense of pleasure and pain,

02:16.360 --> 02:19.320
 and ultimately whether or not we remain happy

02:19.320 --> 02:22.320
 in our pursuit of pleasure or not.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.440
 This is an absolutely crucial aspect

02:24.440 --> 02:27.080
 to the way that we function in everyday life,

02:27.080 --> 02:30.840
 and especially under conditions of mood disorders.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.460
 The pathway that she was describing

02:32.460 --> 02:34.520
 is the so-called pleasure system.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.460
 However, what most people don't realize

02:36.460 --> 02:37.960
 is that the pleasure system

02:37.960 --> 02:40.360
 is also directly associated with,

02:40.360 --> 02:42.500
 and in fact is the very same system

02:42.500 --> 02:47.120
 that modulates mental or psychological anguish and pain.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.640
 Essentially, what she described

02:48.640 --> 02:50.960
 is that whenever we pursue something

02:50.960 --> 02:53.500
 that we think will bring us pleasure,

02:53.500 --> 02:54.660
 and that could be anything

02:54.660 --> 02:56.160
 that we think will bring us pleasure,

02:56.160 --> 02:59.420
 from food to video games to sex

02:59.420 --> 03:03.280
 to a particular job or goal, short-term or long-term,

03:04.280 --> 03:09.280
 that we experience release of the neuromodulator dopamine.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.060
 Now, dopamine is associated

03:11.060 --> 03:13.480
 with increased levels of motivation and drive.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.000
 It is not the molecule of reward.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.560
 It is the molecule of craving, motivation, and drive.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.480
 However, as Dr. Lemke pointed out,

03:21.480 --> 03:23.560
 when we are in pursuit of something,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.680
 there is a release of dopamine in our brain.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.320
 That makes us feel motivated,

03:28.320 --> 03:30.820
 and in general, it makes us feel good.

03:30.820 --> 03:33.160
 But very shortly thereafter,

03:33.160 --> 03:36.000
 and beneath our conscious awareness,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.440
 there is a tilt of the pleasure-pain balance in the brain,

03:39.440 --> 03:41.260
 literally a shift in the neural circuits

03:41.260 --> 03:43.200
 that underlie pleasure and pain,

03:43.200 --> 03:47.320
 such that every bit of pleasure or pleasure-seeking

03:47.320 --> 03:49.480
 that causes release of dopamine

03:49.480 --> 03:53.800
 will be balanced out by a little bit of pain.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.320
 And we don't experience this as physical pain,

03:56.320 --> 03:57.460
 at least not at first.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.040
 We experience it as craving for more

04:00.040 --> 04:02.380
 of the thing that brought us pleasure.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.720
 Now, that sounds pretty good.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.560
 You get pleasure,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.840
 and then you get a little bit of pain to balance it out.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.560
 It's subconscious, and you experience it

04:08.560 --> 04:11.320
 as the desire to seek out more pleasure.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.560
 However, it's actually more diabolical than that,

04:14.560 --> 04:16.080
 and we really need to keep an eye on this

04:16.080 --> 04:18.040
 if we are to remain happy,

04:18.040 --> 04:20.620
 if we are to remain in pursuit of our goals.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.640
 The crucial thing to understand is that if we remain

04:23.640 --> 04:26.200
 in constant pursuit of pleasure,

04:26.200 --> 04:28.440
 the pain side of the balance tips

04:28.440 --> 04:30.940
 so that each time we are in pursuit

04:30.940 --> 04:34.300
 of that pleasureful thing, activity or substance,

04:34.300 --> 04:36.400
 we are going to experience,

04:36.400 --> 04:39.440
 we literally achieve less dopamine release

04:39.440 --> 04:41.080
 each subsequent time.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.920
 So we get less pleasure,

04:42.920 --> 04:45.360
 and the amount of craving increases.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.000
 Now, after a certain point or threshold,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.720
 we call that addiction.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.700
 And the way to reset the balance,

04:50.700 --> 04:51.540
 and this is very important,

04:51.540 --> 04:54.580
 the way to reset the balance is actually to enter

04:54.580 --> 04:58.280
 into states in which we are not in pursuit of pleasure,

04:58.280 --> 05:01.760
 to literally enter states in which we are bored,

05:01.760 --> 05:03.760
 maybe even a little bored and anxious,

05:03.760 --> 05:06.640
 and that resets the pleasure-pain balance

05:06.640 --> 05:08.920
 so that we can return to our pursuit of pleasure

05:08.920 --> 05:11.880
 in a way that's healthy and that in an ongoing way

05:11.880 --> 05:14.080
 won't lead to this over-tipping

05:14.080 --> 05:18.120
 or this increase in the amount of pain or addiction.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.240
 So this is very important,

05:19.240 --> 05:20.360
 and if this seemed vague,

05:20.360 --> 05:23.160
 what this means is we should always be cautious

05:23.160 --> 05:27.720
 of any state of mind or body or any pursuit

05:27.720 --> 05:30.840
 that leads to very large increases in dopamine,

05:30.840 --> 05:33.200
 and if it does, we should be very careful

05:33.200 --> 05:36.000
 to not pursue that repeatedly over time.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.060
 During today's episode, I'm going to give an example,

05:38.060 --> 05:40.800
 a real-life example of a discussion that I've been in

05:40.800 --> 05:42.500
 with a young man who's 21 years old

05:42.500 --> 05:44.480
 who's dealing with a disruption

05:44.480 --> 05:46.320
 in this pleasure-pain balance.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.160
 He is essentially depressed,

05:49.160 --> 05:52.680
 and he's depressed because of his ongoing pursuit

05:52.680 --> 05:54.200
 of a particular activity

05:54.200 --> 05:56.880
 that initially led to a lot of dopamine,

05:56.880 --> 05:59.280
 but over time has led to less and less dopamine

05:59.280 --> 06:03.360
 and more and more of this pain side of the balance.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.120
 We could call him addicted to that particular activity.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.680
 Whether or not he's addicted by clinical standards or not

06:09.680 --> 06:11.080
 really isn't important.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.520
 What is important is that he experiences this as depression,

06:15.520 --> 06:18.520
 as low affect as it's called, or anhedonia,

06:18.520 --> 06:20.960
 an inability to experience pleasure

06:20.960 --> 06:23.560
 from that thing or from anything else,

06:23.560 --> 06:25.160
 and he's currently undergoing treatment

06:25.160 --> 06:28.120
 through a rebalancing of this pleasure-pain pathway.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.980
 So while I can't reveal his identity to you,

06:29.980 --> 06:31.200
 that wouldn't be appropriate,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.880
 he did give me permission to reveal the general architecture

06:33.880 --> 06:35.080
 of what he's coping with,

06:35.080 --> 06:37.360
 and I spent some hours with him on the phone this week

06:37.360 --> 06:39.720
 talking to him as well as to the various people

06:39.720 --> 06:41.140
 that he's working with to really understand

06:41.140 --> 06:42.160
 what's going on here,

06:42.160 --> 06:44.600
 because I think it can illustrate the relationship

06:44.600 --> 06:48.880
 between dopamine, pleasure, and pain for sake of addiction,

06:48.880 --> 06:52.620
 but also for understanding how to avoid depressive states,

06:52.620 --> 06:55.480
 how to remove ourselves from depressive states.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.920
 And as you'll see today, as we discussed depression,

06:57.920 --> 07:00.440
 many of the molecules and neural pathways

07:00.440 --> 07:04.440
 and biological mechanisms that we know can be used

07:04.440 --> 07:06.880
 to counter depression,

07:06.880 --> 07:09.400
 feed back onto this pleasure-pain balance.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.780
 Before we begin, I'd like to say that this podcast

07:11.780 --> 07:14.720
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.880
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

07:16.880 --> 07:19.600
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

07:19.600 --> 07:22.600
 and science-related tools to the general public.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.720
 In keeping with that theme,

07:23.720 --> 07:26.600
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.380
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.820
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:31.820 --> 07:34.440
 that analyzes data from blood and DNA

07:34.440 --> 07:35.980
 to help you better understand your body

07:35.980 --> 07:37.960
 and help you reach your health goals.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.800
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:40.800 --> 07:43.400
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

07:43.400 --> 07:45.760
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

07:45.760 --> 07:48.960
 can only be detected from a quality blood test.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.120
 The problem with most blood tests, however,

07:51.120 --> 07:53.740
 is that you get information back about hormone levels,

07:53.740 --> 07:56.040
 metabolic factors, et cetera,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.480
 but you don't really know what to do with that information.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.200
 Some things might be flagged as too high or too low,

08:02.200 --> 08:05.160
 but really interpreting those data and taking action

08:05.160 --> 08:07.480
 to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want

08:07.480 --> 08:08.560
 is what it's really about.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.820
 And Inside Tracker makes all that very easy.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.100
 They have a platform, it's a dashboard,

08:14.100 --> 08:15.880
 that will tell you, for instance,

08:15.880 --> 08:19.280
 what sorts of dietary changes or supplementation changes

08:19.280 --> 08:23.040
 or exercise changes will help you bring various hormones,

08:23.040 --> 08:25.280
 metabolic factors, and other factors

08:25.280 --> 08:27.680
 into the ranges that are right for you.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.300
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

08:29.300 --> 08:32.600
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

08:38.840 --> 08:41.840
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.480
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

08:43.480 --> 08:45.880
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.360
 I've been using Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.960
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.720
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

08:53.720 --> 08:55.640
 and that I still take Athletic Greens

08:55.640 --> 08:58.320
 is that it really covers all of my foundational

08:58.320 --> 09:00.480
 nutrient and micronutrient needs.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.120
 It has vitamins, minerals,

09:02.120 --> 09:04.820
 and the thing that's especially important to me these days

09:04.820 --> 09:08.280
 is the probiotics, because there are so many data

09:08.280 --> 09:10.640
 that show that having a healthy gut microbiome

09:10.640 --> 09:13.200
 is vital to having a healthy immune system

09:13.200 --> 09:15.760
 and for healthy gut-brain access.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.600
 Literally the functioning of your brain, your mood,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.400
 various aspects of brain inflammation

09:20.400 --> 09:22.200
 or limiting brain inflammation

09:22.200 --> 09:24.760
 are facilitated by having a healthy gut microbiome,

09:24.760 --> 09:28.120
 and that's facilitated by getting the proper probiotics.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.680
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

09:29.680 --> 09:32.960
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.000
 If you do that, you can claim their special offer.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.160
 The special offer is five free travel packs,

09:37.160 --> 09:39.520
 which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

09:39.520 --> 09:41.480
 while you're on the road or in the car,

09:41.480 --> 09:44.160
 and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.680
 Vitamin D3K2 have been shown to have

09:46.680 --> 09:48.900
 a number of different positive health effects

09:48.900 --> 09:51.600
 on hormones, on cardiovascular health, and so on.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.340
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

09:54.340 --> 09:56.040
 to claim their special offer.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.440
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.140
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

10:02.140 --> 10:03.880
 that raises organic, grass-fed,

10:03.880 --> 10:06.600
 and finished certified humane meats.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.040
 I don't eat a lot of meat.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.840
 Typically, my diet regime is one

10:09.840 --> 10:12.160
 in which I fast until about noon,

10:12.160 --> 10:14.400
 and then I have a lunch which is fairly low carb,

10:14.400 --> 10:17.640
 so I'll have some piece of meat or chicken or fish

10:17.640 --> 10:19.800
 and some salad typically.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.640
 And then in the evening

10:20.640 --> 10:22.920
 is when I tend to emphasize carbohydrates.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.120
 That helps me be really alert during the day

10:25.120 --> 10:27.300
 and sleep well at night.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.520
 When I do eat meat,

10:28.520 --> 10:31.160
 I insist that the meat be of the very highest quality

10:31.160 --> 10:33.560
 and that it is sourced in humane ways.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.020
 Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

10:36.020 --> 10:37.120
 and seasonal grasses,

10:37.120 --> 10:39.320
 and that results in meat that is higher in nutrients

10:39.320 --> 10:40.440
 and healthy fats.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.640
 There are now a lot of data pointing to the fact

10:42.640 --> 10:45.000
 that high levels of omega-3 fatty acids

10:45.000 --> 10:47.980
 are vital for mood, for cardiovascular health,

10:47.980 --> 10:50.060
 and various aspects of maintaining

10:50.060 --> 10:52.320
 what's called a healthy inflammatome,

10:52.320 --> 10:54.180
 the various things in our brain and body

10:54.180 --> 10:56.680
 that maintain a healthy inflammation response,

10:56.680 --> 10:59.760
 but one that doesn't go out of whack or get unchecked

10:59.760 --> 11:02.280
 in any way that is detrimental to us.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.840

11:16.940 --> 11:19.040
 Today, we're discussing depression.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.760
 In particular, we're going to talk about major depression.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.380
 The phrase major depression is used to distinguish

11:24.380 --> 11:26.460
 one form of depression from the other,

11:26.460 --> 11:28.760
 the other one being bipolar depression.

11:28.760 --> 11:33.280
 Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder,

11:33.280 --> 11:36.960
 is really characterized by manic highs,

11:36.960 --> 11:38.960
 so where people aren't sleeping

11:38.960 --> 11:40.400
 and they're talking very fast

11:40.400 --> 11:43.120
 and they're buying things and pursuing resources

11:43.120 --> 11:44.560
 that they can't afford,

11:44.560 --> 11:46.640
 they're starting relationships left and right,

11:46.640 --> 11:50.640
 they're manic, followed by periods of crashes

11:50.640 --> 11:54.360
 of feeling very low, lethargic, and so on.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.520
 Bipolar depression is an absolutely crucial thing

11:57.520 --> 11:59.300
 for us to discuss, and therefore,

11:59.300 --> 12:01.960
 we are going to have an entire separate episode

12:01.960 --> 12:04.900
 related to bipolar depression.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.840
 Today, we're going to talk about major depression,

12:06.840 --> 12:09.400
 also sometimes called unipolar depression,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.620
 just because it doesn't have the highs and lows,

12:11.620 --> 12:13.980
 it's more characterized by the lows.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.640
 We're going to talk about the biology, the psychology,

12:18.640 --> 12:19.740
 and the various treatments,

12:19.740 --> 12:22.640
 behavioral, drugs, supplementation, diet, exercise,

12:22.640 --> 12:23.480
 all of that.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.360
 Before we go forward into the material,

12:25.360 --> 12:27.800
 I just want to emphasize that any discussion

12:27.800 --> 12:29.840
 about mood disorders carries with it

12:29.840 --> 12:32.080
 a particular sensitivity,

12:32.080 --> 12:35.380
 and that sensitivity is one related to self-diagnosis.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.560
 Today's episode, and indeed in the future episodes

12:39.560 --> 12:41.440
 for this month on mood disorders,

12:41.440 --> 12:43.500
 you're going to hear various symptomologies

12:43.500 --> 12:48.020
 that are used to diagnose and characterize these disorders.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.560
 If you recognize some of these symptomologies in yourself

12:51.560 --> 12:53.340
 or in others that you know,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.200
 that's an important thing to take note of.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.280
 However, accurate diagnosis really should be done

12:59.280 --> 13:01.320
 by a qualified healthcare professional.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.380
 So at once I'm saying, keep your eyes and your ears up

13:04.380 --> 13:06.360
 for things that sound familiar to you

13:06.360 --> 13:07.440
 that might be of concern.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.460
 And at the same time, I'm saying,

13:09.460 --> 13:11.600
 don't necessarily leap to conclusions.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.080
 Take those flags of concern if they're there

13:14.080 --> 13:16.480
 and bring them to a qualified healthcare professional,

13:16.480 --> 13:19.960
 and they'll be able to properly diagnose you

13:19.960 --> 13:21.800
 as having a particular mood disorder

13:21.800 --> 13:24.280
 or diagnose somebody as having a particular mood disorder

13:24.280 --> 13:26.900
 or not, and that's an essential step.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.280
 I don't say this to protect us.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.600
 I say this really to protect you.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.660
 Okay, let's have a fact-based discussion about depression.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.720
 And I promise you that where we don't know

13:37.720 --> 13:40.680
 certain things about depression, I will be clear to tell you.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.560
 In fact, we are going to talk about some treatments

13:42.560 --> 13:45.060
 for depression that are looking very promising

13:45.060 --> 13:48.920
 and that right now are actually being used more and more.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.320
 And from my read of the mechanistic literature,

13:52.320 --> 13:54.900
 we're still a bit in the dark as to how these work.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.520
 That's actually a common theme of medicine.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.520
 Many times there are treatments that seem promising

13:59.520 --> 14:01.600
 or that look really terrific,

14:01.600 --> 14:04.500
 and there isn't a lot of understanding about mechanism.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.360
 However, any good discussion about neuroscience

14:07.360 --> 14:09.040
 and in particular about mood disorders

14:09.040 --> 14:10.320
 has to get into mechanism.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.360
 So we're going to do that.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.040
 And in doing that, we're going to frame the discussion

14:15.040 --> 14:18.200
 for the tools of how to keep depression at bay

14:18.200 --> 14:19.440
 and how to deal with it

14:19.440 --> 14:21.020
 if you happen to find yourself depressed

14:21.020 --> 14:23.980
 or if you know somebody else who's depressed.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.480
 What is this thing we call depression?

14:26.480 --> 14:27.400
 Well, as I mentioned before,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.780
 it has two forms, bipolar depression,

14:29.780 --> 14:31.340
 which we're not talking about today,

14:31.340 --> 14:33.000
 and major depression,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.100
 also called unipolar depression, is the other.

14:37.040 --> 14:41.680
 Major depression impacts 5% of the population.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.160
 That is an enormous number.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.800
 That means if you're in a class of 100 people,

14:46.800 --> 14:49.060
 five of them are dealing with major depression

14:49.060 --> 14:51.160
 or have at some point.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.640
 Look around you in any environment

14:52.640 --> 14:56.540
 and you can be sure that a good portion of the people

14:56.540 --> 14:59.880
 that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression

14:59.880 --> 15:01.260
 or will be at some point.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.120
 So this is something we really have to take seriously

15:03.120 --> 15:04.720
 and that we want to understand.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.480
 It is the number four cause of disability.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.400
 A lot of people miss work, miss school,

15:12.400 --> 15:16.280
 and before then likely perform poorly in work or school

15:16.280 --> 15:18.720
 due to major depression.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.320
 Now, there's a very serious challenge

15:21.320 --> 15:23.640
 in having a discussion about depression,

15:23.640 --> 15:25.480
 and it relates directly to the challenges

15:25.480 --> 15:27.040
 in diagnosing depression.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.800
 Earlier, I did an episode with Dr. Carl Deisseroth,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.440
 who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD,

15:33.440 --> 15:34.280
 he's a psychiatrist,

15:34.280 --> 15:35.720
 and he made a very important point,

15:35.720 --> 15:39.880
 which is that the field of psychiatry and psychology

15:39.880 --> 15:41.320
 are confronted with a challenge,

15:41.320 --> 15:43.440
 which is they're trying to understand what's going on

15:43.440 --> 15:47.280
 within the stuff that's in our brains,

15:47.280 --> 15:49.440
 that's deep to our skulls.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.640
 We don't have access to that without brain imaging

15:51.640 --> 15:53.520
 and electrodes and things like that.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.880
 Someone just comes into the office

15:54.880 --> 15:58.520
 and the dissection tool for depression, so to speak,

15:58.520 --> 15:59.520
 is language.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.280
 In order to determine if somebody has depression or not,

16:03.280 --> 16:05.660
 we have to use language, how they talk about things,

16:05.660 --> 16:07.280
 also how they carry their body,

16:07.280 --> 16:09.620
 also some general patterns of health.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.840
 So let's talk about depression

16:11.840 --> 16:14.520
 the way that clinicians talk about depression,

16:14.520 --> 16:18.560
 because one of the issues is that we use the word depression

16:18.560 --> 16:20.680
 loosely, a lot of people say, oh, you know,

16:20.680 --> 16:24.240
 I'm so depressed, I didn't get this job or I'm so depressed,

16:24.240 --> 16:25.920
 I just, I don't know, I had a really rough week

16:25.920 --> 16:29.240
 or I'm exhausted, I'm so depressed, or I'm so depressed,

16:29.240 --> 16:30.600
 I thought I was going to go on vacation

16:30.600 --> 16:32.640
 and then they canceled the flight, okay?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.240
 That is not clinical depression,

16:35.240 --> 16:38.320
 that's called being bummed out, being sad or disappointed.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.760
 Now that person might be depressed,

16:39.760 --> 16:41.040
 but clinical depression

16:41.040 --> 16:43.880
 actually has some very specific criteria

16:43.880 --> 16:48.420
 and those criteria are mainly characterized

16:48.420 --> 16:51.160
 by the presence of certain things

16:51.160 --> 16:54.580
 and the absence of a few particular things.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.520
 So let's talk about the things that are present

16:57.520 --> 17:00.480
 in somebody that has major depression.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.900
 First of all, there tends to be a lot of grief,

17:03.900 --> 17:06.560
 there tends to be a lot of sadness, that's no surprise.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.140
 The threshold to cry is often a signature of depression.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.160
 Now that doesn't mean that if you cry easily

17:12.160 --> 17:14.140
 that you're depressed, some people cry more easily

17:14.140 --> 17:15.920
 than others, but if you're somebody

17:15.920 --> 17:17.580
 who typically didn't cry easily

17:17.580 --> 17:20.240
 and suddenly you find yourself crying very easily,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.440
 that could be a sign of depression

17:22.440 --> 17:23.880
 and I want to emphasize could.

17:24.780 --> 17:27.360
 There's also this thing that we call anhedonia,

17:27.360 --> 17:30.440
 a general lack of ability to enjoy things,

17:30.440 --> 17:33.080
 things that typically or previously we enjoyed,

17:33.080 --> 17:36.000
 things like food, things like sex, things like exercise,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
 things like social gatherings,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.160
 a kind of lack of enjoyment from those things.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.320
 Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad

17:44.320 --> 17:47.840
 and sometimes it's just flat, it's just kind of neutral,

17:47.840 --> 17:49.940
 it doesn't feel good because there's nothing there,

17:49.940 --> 17:54.400
 it's like bland food, it's like these experiences

17:54.400 --> 17:58.500
 are analogous to biting into your favorite article of food

17:58.500 --> 18:00.980
 and it just not tasting very good,

18:00.980 --> 18:02.700
 it just doesn't taste like anything at all

18:02.700 --> 18:05.960
 and that's a common symptom of major depression.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.160
 The other one is guilt.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.120
 Oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty

18:11.120 --> 18:12.800
 about things they have done in the past

18:12.800 --> 18:16.060
 or they'll just generally feel badly about themselves

18:16.060 --> 18:17.480
 and we're going to talk about this

18:17.480 --> 18:20.320
 because it relates to some of the more serious symptomology

18:20.320 --> 18:21.640
 seen in depression sometimes,

18:21.640 --> 18:25.120
 things like self-harm, mutilation or even suicide.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.600
 But for the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia,

18:28.600 --> 18:31.840
 this lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure,

18:31.840 --> 18:34.680
 a kind of a flat affect as it's called.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.500
 Sometimes even delusional thinking,

18:37.500 --> 18:40.720
 negative delusional thinking and in particular,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.080
 anti-self confabulation.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.680
 What is anti-self confabulation?

18:44.680 --> 18:48.160
 Well, first of all, confabulation is an incredible aspect

18:48.160 --> 18:50.220
 of our mind and our nervous system.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.480
 You sometimes see other forms of confabulation

18:53.480 --> 18:55.420
 in people who have memory deficits,

18:55.420 --> 18:57.240
 either because they have brain damage

18:57.240 --> 19:00.200
 or they have age-related dementia.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.720
 A good example of this would be

19:01.720 --> 19:03.760
 someone with age-related dementia

19:03.760 --> 19:07.800
 sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house

19:07.800 --> 19:09.620
 and not know how they got there.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.320
 And if you ask them, oh, what are you doing here?

19:12.320 --> 19:14.280
 They will create these elaborate stories.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.860
 Oh, you know, I was thinking about going to shopping today

19:16.860 --> 19:19.640
 and I was going to take the bus and then I was going to do,

19:19.640 --> 19:23.000
 they create these elaborate stories, they confabulate.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.080
 And yet that person hasn't left the house in weeks

19:25.080 --> 19:26.740
 and that person doesn't have a driver's license.

19:26.740 --> 19:28.640
 And so they're really just creating this stuff.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.720
 They're not lying to get out of anything,

19:30.720 --> 19:31.560
 they're confabulating.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.360
 It's as if a brain circuit that writes stories

19:34.360 --> 19:36.680
 just starts generating content.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.120
 In major depression, there's often a state of

19:40.120 --> 19:42.600
 delusional anti-self confabulation

19:42.600 --> 19:45.900
 where the confabulations are not directly

19:45.900 --> 19:48.160
 or completely linked to reality,

19:48.160 --> 19:50.840
 but they are ones that make the self,

19:50.840 --> 19:52.520
 the person describing them,

19:52.520 --> 19:56.920
 seem sick or in some way not well.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.200
 A good example would be somebody

19:58.200 --> 20:00.780
 who experiences a physical injury, perhaps.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.900
 Maybe they break their ankle, maybe it's an athlete

20:02.900 --> 20:06.240
 and they also happen to become depressed.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.040
 And you'll talk to them, you say, how are things going?

20:08.040 --> 20:08.880
 How's your rehab?

20:08.880 --> 20:09.720
 And they'll go, oh, it's okay.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.520
 And I don't know, I feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker

20:12.520 --> 20:14.880
 by the day, I'm just not performing well.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.720
 And then you'll talk to the person that they're working with,

20:17.720 --> 20:21.120
 their kinesiologist or whoever the physical therapist is,

20:21.120 --> 20:23.040
 and they'll say, no, they're actually really improving.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.120
 And I tell them they're improving,

20:24.120 --> 20:26.800
 but somehow they're not seeing that improvement.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.620
 They're not registering that improvement.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.480
 You notice that sometimes it's subtle

20:30.480 --> 20:33.720
 and sometimes it's severe, but they'll start confabulating.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.400
 You'll say, I actually heard you're doing much better.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.420
 You're getting better.

20:37.420 --> 20:40.320
 You're taking multiple trips around the building now

20:40.320 --> 20:42.080
 before you could barely get out of bed.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.760
 And they'll say, yeah, well, basically,

20:44.760 --> 20:47.520
 they changed some things about the parking lot

20:47.520 --> 20:48.760
 that make it easier to move around.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.000
 So it's not really me.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.400
 And these aren't people that are just explaining away

20:52.400 --> 20:54.380
 their accomplishments

20:54.380 --> 20:57.000
 because they're trying to brush off praise.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.740
 They are viewing themselves and they're confabulating

21:00.740 --> 21:04.760
 according to a view that is very self-deprecating

21:04.760 --> 21:07.500
 to the point where it doesn't match up with reality.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.920
 It's not what other people see,

21:08.920 --> 21:11.500
 and it's actually not matched up with reality.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.780
 And that's a symptom of depression

21:13.780 --> 21:16.080
 that I think we don't often think about

21:16.080 --> 21:18.000
 or conceptualize enough.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.640
 So it's not just telling people, oh yeah,

21:20.640 --> 21:22.760
 it's not as good as it seems, everything's bad.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.200
 These people really believe that

21:24.200 --> 21:26.320
 and it becomes disconnected from reality.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.380
 So it's if they're sort of sinking into a pit

21:28.380 --> 21:30.980
 and they're losing touch with the realities of the world,

21:30.980 --> 21:32.980
 including data about themselves,

21:32.980 --> 21:35.380
 their ability to move and get around,

21:35.380 --> 21:37.920
 for example, in the particular instance

21:37.920 --> 21:40.960
 that I used as an example, but there are others as well.

21:40.960 --> 21:45.360
 The other common symptomology of major depression

21:45.360 --> 21:48.680
 is what they call vegetative symptoms, okay?

21:48.680 --> 21:52.260
 So vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur

21:52.260 --> 21:55.040
 without any thinking, without any doing,

21:55.040 --> 21:56.460
 or without any confabulation.

21:56.460 --> 21:59.080
 These are things that are related to our core physiology.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.080
 The word vegetative, you might know it sounds like vegetable.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.520
 It actually relates to a system in the body

22:04.520 --> 22:06.160
 that nowadays is more commonly called

22:06.160 --> 22:08.480
 the autonomic nervous system.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.600
 The vegetative nervous system

22:10.600 --> 22:12.320
 and the autonomic nervous system,

22:12.320 --> 22:15.040
 historically we're considered sort of one in the same,

22:15.040 --> 22:17.840
 and it relates to things like the stress response

22:17.840 --> 22:19.720
 or to our ability to sleep.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.280
 So vegetative symptoms

22:21.280 --> 22:24.400
 be things like constantly being exhausted.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.720
 The person just feels exhausted.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.400
 It's not because they exercise too much.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.680
 It's not necessarily because of a life event.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.440
 It could be, but they're just worn out.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.080
 They don't have the energy they once had.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.180
 So it's not in their heads.

22:38.180 --> 22:40.840
 It's probably, and now I think we have good data

22:40.840 --> 22:43.480
 to support the fact that there's something off.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.520
 Something is disrupted in the autonomic

22:45.520 --> 22:47.560
 or so-called vegetative nervous system.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.400
 And one of the most common symptoms

22:49.400 --> 22:51.220
 of people with major depression,

22:51.220 --> 22:53.640
 one of the signs of major depression

22:53.640 --> 22:57.580
 is early waking and not being able to fall back asleep

22:57.580 --> 22:59.820
 despite being exhausted.

22:59.820 --> 23:03.220
 So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. or 5 a.m.,

23:03.220 --> 23:06.220
 just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.900
 I want to emphasize that that could happen

23:07.900 --> 23:09.840
 for other reasons as well,

23:09.840 --> 23:11.960
 but it is a common symptom

23:11.960 --> 23:14.520
 or warning sign of major depression.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.960
 So let's talk more about sleep and depression.

23:17.880 --> 23:21.460
 It's well-known that the architecture of sleep

23:21.460 --> 23:23.320
 is disrupted in depression.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.680
 What's the architecture of sleep?

23:24.680 --> 23:26.100
 I've done entire episodes about this,

23:26.100 --> 23:28.340
 but very briefly in two sentences,

23:28.340 --> 23:31.120
 although they'll probably be run on sentences,

23:31.120 --> 23:34.320
 early in the night, you tend to have slow wave sleep

23:34.320 --> 23:36.620
 more than REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep.

23:36.620 --> 23:37.480
 As the night goes on,

23:37.480 --> 23:39.860
 you tend to have more rapid eye movement sleep.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.400
 That architecture of slow wave sleep

23:42.400 --> 23:44.840
 preceding rapid eye movement sleep

23:44.840 --> 23:49.840
 is radically disrupted in major depression.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.220
 In addition, the pattern of activity in the brain

23:52.220 --> 23:55.200
 during particular phases of sleep is disrupted.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.440
 Now this is during sleep.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.460
 So this can't be that people are creating

23:58.460 --> 23:59.640
 this situation for themselves.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.920
 These are real physiological signs

24:01.920 --> 24:04.780
 that something is off in this so-called autonomic

24:04.780 --> 24:06.880
 or vegetative nervous system.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.160
 And then there are some other things

24:08.160 --> 24:10.800
 that relate to the autonomic nervous system,

24:10.800 --> 24:14.560
 but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.180
 And these are things like decreased appetite.

24:17.180 --> 24:21.160
 So you could imagine that one could have decreased appetite

24:21.160 --> 24:24.680
 because of the anhedonia, the lack of pleasure from food.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.760
 If you don't enjoy food,

24:25.760 --> 24:28.520
 then you might be less motivated to eat it.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.680
 That makes sense.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.500
 As well, because of these disruptions

24:31.500 --> 24:33.240
 in the autonomic nervous system,

24:33.240 --> 24:35.540
 these vegetative symptoms as they're called,

24:35.540 --> 24:37.760
 you could imagine that someone would have decreased appetite

24:37.760 --> 24:40.320
 because some of the hormones associated with appetite,

24:40.320 --> 24:42.840
 hypocretinorexin and things of that sort,

24:42.840 --> 24:45.480
 ghrelin, that those will be disrupted.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.660
 And if those names of hypocretinorexin and ghrelin

24:47.660 --> 24:49.820
 don't make any sense to you, don't worry about it.

24:49.820 --> 24:53.160
 What those are just hormones that impact when we eat,

24:53.160 --> 24:57.140
 when we feel hungry and when we crave food more,

24:57.140 --> 24:58.600
 as well as when we feel full,

24:58.600 --> 25:00.440
 we have enough so-called satiety.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.700
 If you want to learn more about those,

25:01.700 --> 25:04.720
 we did entire episodes on eating and metabolism.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.940
 So you can see that the symptomology of major depression

25:07.940 --> 25:09.800
 impacts us at multiple levels.

25:09.800 --> 25:14.160
 There's the conscious level of how excited we are generally.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.320
 Well, that's reduced.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.560
 There's grief, there's guilt, there's crying,

25:18.560 --> 25:20.640
 but then there's also these vegetative things.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.860
 There's disruptions in sleep,

25:21.860 --> 25:23.840
 which of course make everything more challenging

25:23.840 --> 25:24.680
 when we're awake.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.020
 We know that sleep is so vital for resetting.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.940
 You're waking up early, you can't get back to sleep.

25:28.940 --> 25:32.840
 That's going to adjust your affect,

25:32.840 --> 25:34.360
 your emotions in negative ways.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.920
 We know this and appetite is off

25:36.920 --> 25:39.480
 and there are hormones that get disrupted.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.640
 So cortisol levels are increased.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.600
 In particular, there's a signature pattern of depression

25:44.600 --> 25:47.280
 whereby cortisol, this stress hormone

25:47.280 --> 25:49.720
 that normally is released in a healthy way

25:49.720 --> 25:51.900
 only in the early part of the day

25:51.900 --> 25:54.720
 is shifted to late in the day.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.520
 In fact, a 9 p.m. peak in cortisol

25:57.520 --> 26:01.000
 is one of the physiological signatures

26:01.000 --> 26:02.840
 of depressive like states.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.440
 It's not the only one, but it is an important one.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.520
 So there are a lot of things going on in major depression.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.000
 And by now you're probably thinking,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.200
 oh goodness, this is dreadful.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.520
 Like there's all this terrible stuff.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.480
 And indeed it is terrible.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.400
 It is a terrible thing to find oneself

26:17.400 --> 26:20.660
 in a mode where things feel sad, you feel guilty,

26:20.660 --> 26:22.040
 you're exhausted.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.480
 And oftentimes there's also an association

26:24.480 --> 26:26.620
 with the anxiety system.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.160
 So just because people are exhausted and lethargic

26:29.160 --> 26:31.320
 and they don't enjoy things doesn't necessarily mean

26:31.320 --> 26:33.320
 that there's an absence of anxiety.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.640
 There can also be a lot of anxiety

26:34.640 --> 26:35.920
 about what's going to happen to me.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.120
 Am I going to be able to achieve my goals in life?

26:38.120 --> 26:40.520
 Will I ever get out of this state?

26:40.520 --> 26:42.420
 And so things really start to layer on.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.580
 And if this sounds depressing to you,

26:44.580 --> 26:46.380
 it is indeed depressing.

26:46.380 --> 26:49.720
 This is really the place that many people find themselves.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.520
 And it's a pit that they just don't know

26:51.520 --> 26:52.940
 how to climb out of.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.720
 So let's just take a few minutes

26:54.720 --> 26:57.400
 and talk about some of the underlying biology

26:57.400 --> 27:00.020
 that creates this cloud

27:00.020 --> 27:02.960
 or this constellation of symptomology.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.400
 I think that's really important to do

27:04.400 --> 27:08.200
 because if we want to understand the various treatments,

27:08.200 --> 27:10.680
 how they work and why they work and how to implement them,

27:10.680 --> 27:13.240
 we have to understand some of the underlying biology.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.040
 So let's spend a few minutes talking about

27:15.040 --> 27:16.760
 the biology of depression.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.480
 What's known, what's not known.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.800
 Because in doing that,

27:19.800 --> 27:21.860
 I think you'll get a much clearer picture

27:21.860 --> 27:25.000
 about why certain tools work to relieve depression

27:25.000 --> 27:26.680
 and why others might not.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.040
 So one of the most important early findings

27:31.040 --> 27:35.200
 in the search for a biological basis of depression

27:35.200 --> 27:37.960
 was this finding that there are drugs

27:37.960 --> 27:40.840
 that relieve some of the symptoms of depression.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.520
 Those drugs generally fall into three major categories,

27:45.520 --> 27:48.320
 but the first set of ones that were discovered

27:48.320 --> 27:51.780
 were the so-called tricyclic antidepressants

27:51.780 --> 27:56.780
 and the MAO inhibitors, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.040
 You don't need to understand that nomenclature,

27:59.040 --> 28:00.600
 but I'm going to give you a little bit of detail

28:00.600 --> 28:03.480
 so that if you want to understand it, you can.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.920
 Most of this work took place in the late 1950s

28:06.920 --> 28:11.320
 and in the 1960s and continued well until the 1980s

28:11.320 --> 28:13.880
 when new classes of drugs were discovered.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.080
 And these tricyclic antidepressants

28:16.080 --> 28:20.160
 and the MAO inhibitors largely worked

28:20.160 --> 28:24.440
 by increasing levels of norepinephrine in the brain,

28:24.440 --> 28:27.100
 as well as in the body in some cases.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.440
 And they were discovered

28:28.440 --> 28:30.320
 through a kind of odd set of circumstances.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.840
 We don't have time to go into all the history,

28:31.840 --> 28:34.120
 but suffice to say that they were discovered

28:34.120 --> 28:36.760
 because of the exploration for drugs

28:36.760 --> 28:39.320
 that alter blood pressure.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.920
 Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure

28:41.920 --> 28:45.200
 and drugs that lower blood pressure,

28:45.200 --> 28:47.440
 reduce levels of norepinephrine,

28:47.440 --> 28:51.280
 and that in many cases was shown to lead to depression

28:51.280 --> 28:53.280
 or depressive-like symptoms.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.720
 And so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs

28:55.720 --> 28:59.740
 and the MAO inhibitors actually increase norepinephrine.

28:59.740 --> 29:03.800
 And frankly, they do quite a good job of relieving some,

29:03.800 --> 29:07.360
 if not all of the symptoms of major depression.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.160
 However, they carry with them many side effects.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.840
 Some of those side effects are side effects related

29:12.840 --> 29:13.960
 to blood pressure itself.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.600
 By increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine as it's called,

29:17.600 --> 29:18.680
 you raise blood pressure.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.060
 That can be dangerous.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.600
 That can be uncomfortable.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.000
 But they also have a lot of other side effects.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.680
 The reason they have other side effects

29:26.680 --> 29:29.060
 is because they impact systems in the brain

29:29.060 --> 29:33.780
 and in the body that impact things like libido, appetite,

29:33.780 --> 29:35.600
 digestion, and others.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.280
 And we'll talk about each of those in sequence.

29:38.280 --> 29:41.160
 Okay, so the experience that clinicians had

29:41.160 --> 29:44.140
 of observing some relief for depression

29:44.140 --> 29:46.120
 with the tricyclic antidepressants

29:46.120 --> 29:48.780
 and with MAO inhibitors was terrific,

29:48.780 --> 29:50.400
 but there were all these side effects,

29:50.400 --> 29:52.440
 side effects that people really did not like.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.360
 They didn't like these drugs at all.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.920
 A lot of people would get dry mouth.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.120
 I mentioned the low libido.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.000
 They'd have sleep issues, appetite issues, weight gain.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.480
 They made some people so uncomfortable

30:01.480 --> 30:02.980
 that they preferred not to take them,

30:02.980 --> 30:04.840
 even though when they didn't take them,

30:04.840 --> 30:06.720
 they had a worsening or a maintenance

30:06.720 --> 30:08.220
 of their depressive symptoms.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.840
 A decade or so later, there was the discovery

30:12.840 --> 30:15.480
 of the so-called pleasure pathways in the brain.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.380
 These are pathways, literally groups of neurons

30:18.380 --> 30:20.520
 that reside in different locations in the brain,

30:20.520 --> 30:22.880
 but connect to one another, so it's a circuit.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.800
 And when you stimulate these neurons

30:25.800 --> 30:29.860
 with certain behaviors or with electrical stimulation

30:29.860 --> 30:31.120
 in an experiment, believe it or not,

30:31.120 --> 30:33.620
 that's been done in both animals and humans,

30:33.620 --> 30:36.640
 animals and humans become very, very motivated

30:36.640 --> 30:39.680
 to get more stimulation of these pathways.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.320
 So this pleasure pathway or these circuits for pleasure

30:43.400 --> 30:45.320
 are very what we call reinforcing.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.600
 In fact, animals and humans will work hard

30:51.600 --> 30:54.040
 to get stimulation of these brain areas

30:54.040 --> 30:58.600
 even more than they will work to obtain sex, drugs,

30:58.600 --> 31:01.200
 or even if they are addicted to a particular drug

31:01.200 --> 31:02.860
 and they are in a state of withdrawal,

31:02.860 --> 31:05.120
 the ultimate state of craving,

31:05.120 --> 31:07.840
 if given a choice, a person or an animal

31:07.840 --> 31:11.840
 will select to have stimulation of this pleasure pathway

31:11.840 --> 31:14.040
 instead of the drug itself.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.060
 And that is a major and significant finding.

31:17.060 --> 31:19.820
 This pleasure pathway, as it's sometimes called,

31:19.820 --> 31:22.040
 involves areas like the nucleus accumbens

31:22.040 --> 31:23.920
 and the ventral tegmental area.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.660
 These are areas of the brain that are rich with neurons

31:26.660 --> 31:28.520
 that make dopamine.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.000
 And if you think to the symptoms of depression,

31:31.000 --> 31:32.760
 of anhedonia, a lack of pleasure,

31:32.760 --> 31:35.340
 a lack of ability to experience pleasure,

31:35.340 --> 31:39.440
 well, that was a smoking gun that there's something wrong

31:39.440 --> 31:42.300
 with the dopamine pathway in depression.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.280
 And indeed that's the case.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.640
 So it's not just norepinephrine,

31:44.640 --> 31:46.960
 it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway

31:46.960 --> 31:48.640
 is somehow disrupted.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.360
 And then in the 1980s,

31:50.360 --> 31:53.000
 there was the discovery of the so-called SSRIs.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.240
 Most people are now familiar with the SSRIs,

31:55.240 --> 31:58.400
 the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.960
 The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms

32:01.960 --> 32:06.060
 from the tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors.

32:06.060 --> 32:08.160
 As their name suggests, SSRI,

32:08.160 --> 32:11.020
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

32:11.020 --> 32:16.020
 prevent serotonin from being wiped up from the synapse

32:16.400 --> 32:18.320
 after two neurons talk to one another.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.200
 What do I mean by that?

32:19.200 --> 32:21.920
 Well, here's some very basic neurobiology 101.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.560
 If you don't know any neurobiology,

32:23.560 --> 32:26.480
 you're going to know some in about 15 seconds.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.540
 Neurons communicate with one another

32:28.540 --> 32:32.520
 by spitting out chemicals into the little gap between them.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.700
 The little gap between them is called the synapse

32:34.700 --> 32:37.320
 or by the Brits, the synapse.

32:37.320 --> 32:40.840
 Those chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side

32:40.840 --> 32:43.200
 and cause changes in the electrical activity

32:43.200 --> 32:46.280
 of that neuron on the other side of the synapse.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.040
 Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter

32:49.040 --> 32:51.720
 or more specifically, it's a neuromodulator.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.520
 It can change the activity of large groups of neurons

32:54.520 --> 32:55.900
 in very meaningful ways.

32:55.900 --> 32:59.400
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor means

32:59.400 --> 33:02.040
 when a person takes this drug,

33:02.040 --> 33:05.160
 some of those drugs include things like Prozac or Zoloft,

33:05.160 --> 33:07.320
 the more typical names or more generic names

33:07.320 --> 33:09.100
 are things like fluoxetine.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.640
 When people take those,

33:10.640 --> 33:13.640
 more serotonin hangs out in the synapse

33:13.640 --> 33:15.880
 and is able to be taken up by the neuron

33:15.880 --> 33:17.540
 on the opposite side

33:17.540 --> 33:22.320
 because of this selective reuptake inhibition.

33:22.320 --> 33:26.680
 It prevents the clearance of serotonin from the synapse

33:26.680 --> 33:29.520
 and thereby more serotonin can have an effect.

33:29.520 --> 33:33.240
 So SSRIs don't increase the total amount of serotonin

33:33.240 --> 33:34.160
 in the brain.

33:34.160 --> 33:37.920
 They change how effective the serotonin

33:37.920 --> 33:40.020
 that's already in the brain is

33:40.020 --> 33:43.840
 at changing the activity of neurons, okay?

33:43.840 --> 33:45.760
 So they don't increase serotonin,

33:45.760 --> 33:49.560
 they increase the efficacy or the function of serotonin

33:49.560 --> 33:51.540
 in the way that I just described.

33:51.540 --> 33:53.000
 So that was more than 15 seconds,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.860
 but now you understand how SSRIs work.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.200
 And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs

33:58.200 --> 34:00.100
 if they didn't in fact work.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.800
 Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.920
 They do carry certain side effects in many individuals.

34:06.920 --> 34:11.240
 Also about a third of people that take SSRIs

34:11.240 --> 34:13.020
 don't derive any benefit.

34:13.020 --> 34:15.320
 It doesn't relieve their symptoms of depression.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.080
 However, for the other two thirds,

34:17.080 --> 34:18.840
 there's often a relief of some,

34:18.840 --> 34:21.480
 if not all of the symptoms of major depression.

34:21.480 --> 34:25.480
 The problem is the side effects that accompany those SSRIs.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.740
 And so these days, SSRIs are a complicated topic.

34:28.740 --> 34:30.780
 It's sort of what I would call a barbed wire topic

34:30.780 --> 34:33.880
 because we often hear about all the problems with them,

34:33.880 --> 34:36.300
 but these drugs also have saved a lot of lives.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.280
 They've also improved a lot of lives.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.640
 The issue is that they tend to have varying effects

34:42.640 --> 34:43.560
 on different individuals

34:43.560 --> 34:45.820
 and sometimes varying effects over time.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.160
 So they'll work for a while,

34:47.160 --> 34:48.240
 then they won't work for a while.

34:48.240 --> 34:51.640
 There are also a lot of mysteries about the SSRIs

34:51.640 --> 34:53.720
 and those mysteries bother people.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.080
 What mysteries am I referring to?

34:55.080 --> 34:59.320
 Well, SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin

34:59.320 --> 35:00.560
 or more specifically,

35:00.560 --> 35:04.240
 they increase the efficacy of serotonin at the synapse.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.840
 That happens immediately

35:05.840 --> 35:08.960
 or very soon after people start taking SSRIs,

35:08.960 --> 35:11.680
 but people generally don't start experiencing any relief

35:11.680 --> 35:13.300
 from their symptoms of depression

35:13.300 --> 35:16.080
 if they're going to experience them at all

35:16.080 --> 35:19.000
 until about two weeks after they start taking these drugs.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.380
 So there's something going on there that's not clear.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.800
 One idea is that the SSRIs

35:23.800 --> 35:27.620
 actually can improve symptoms of depression

35:27.620 --> 35:30.340
 or even remove symptoms of depression

35:30.340 --> 35:32.820
 through so-called neuroplasticity

35:32.820 --> 35:35.900
 by changing the way that neural circuits function.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.800
 And there are many studies on this,

35:37.800 --> 35:40.200
 but the main categories of studies on SSRIs

35:40.200 --> 35:43.000
 that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two camps.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.400
 One is the ways in which SSRIs might,

35:46.400 --> 35:47.760
 and I want to emphasize might,

35:47.760 --> 35:50.180
 be able to trigger the production of more neurons

35:50.180 --> 35:53.200
 in the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus

35:53.200 --> 35:57.480
 called the dentate gyrus and others that impact memory.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.480
 This is important and we're going to come back to memory.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.520
 The other is that the SSRIs have been shown

36:02.520 --> 36:04.880
 in various scientific studies

36:04.880 --> 36:08.480
 to reopen critical periods of plasticity.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.480
 I'll just briefly describe one of those studies.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.400
 It was a study done by Lumberto Maffei's group in Pisa

36:14.400 --> 36:16.800
 that explored brain plasticity

36:16.800 --> 36:18.960
 that's known to be present in young animals

36:18.960 --> 36:21.440
 and disappear in older animals.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.160
 And this is also true in humans.

36:23.160 --> 36:26.000
 Younger humans have a far more plastic brain.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.760
 It can change in many more ways,

36:27.760 --> 36:30.160
 more easily than can the older brain.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.360
 And what they showed was that fluoxetine, Prozac,

36:33.360 --> 36:35.960
 given to adult animals,

36:35.960 --> 36:39.840
 can reopen this incredible period of plasticity.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.600
 It can allow more plasticity to occur.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.440
 That was interesting.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.840
 I mean, it's purely through increases

36:44.840 --> 36:46.880
 in serotonin transmission.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.560
 And there are other studies showing that fluoxetine

36:49.560 --> 36:51.000
 can increase the number of new neurons

36:51.000 --> 36:52.800
 that are born into the adult brain,

36:52.800 --> 36:56.320
 so-called neurogenesis, the production of new neurons.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.360
 So it's very clear that there are at least

36:59.360 --> 37:01.720
 three major chemical systems in the brain,

37:01.720 --> 37:04.640
 norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin

37:04.640 --> 37:09.000
 that relate to and can adjust the symptoms of depression.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.120
 And those actually can be divided into separate categories.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.960
 So for instance, epinephrine or norepinephrine

37:15.960 --> 37:19.320
 is thought to relate to the so-called psychomotor defects,

37:19.320 --> 37:21.360
 sometimes called psychomotor retardation.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.680
 This is the lethargy.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.040
 This is the exhaustion.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.760
 This is the inability to get out of bed in the morning.

37:26.760 --> 37:30.320
 Dopamine is thought to relate to the anhedonia,

37:30.320 --> 37:33.700
 or I should say lack of dopamine in depressive patients

37:33.700 --> 37:35.920
 is thought to lead to the anhedonia,

37:35.920 --> 37:39.360
 the lack of ability to experience pleasure.

37:39.360 --> 37:44.360
 And serotonin is thought to relate to the grief, the guilt,

37:44.400 --> 37:45.840
 some of the more cognitive

37:45.840 --> 37:49.160
 or more emotional aspects of depression.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.760
 So we've got the norepinephrine system

37:50.760 --> 37:52.920
 related to activity and alertness,

37:52.920 --> 37:56.100
 the dopamine system relating to motivation, pleasure,

37:56.100 --> 37:58.520
 and the ability to seek and experience pleasure,

37:58.520 --> 38:02.360
 and then the serotonin system that's related to grief.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.640
 And unfortunately, brains and organisms don't work

38:05.640 --> 38:08.480
 in a simple mathematical way where you just say,

38:08.480 --> 38:10.760
 oh, well, this person's experiencing a lot of grief,

38:10.760 --> 38:14.440
 but they don't have any problems with lethargy,

38:14.440 --> 38:16.320
 and so let's just boost up their serotonin.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.300
 On paper, it works,

38:17.300 --> 38:19.580
 but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.320
 And in another patient,

38:21.320 --> 38:23.280
 you might get somebody who can't experience pleasure,

38:23.280 --> 38:24.520
 but they're kind of anxious.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.240
 They don't have any trouble sleeping,

38:27.240 --> 38:28.800
 but they're just much more anxious

38:28.800 --> 38:31.120
 and frustrated than they normally are,

38:31.120 --> 38:33.240
 and they meet the symptoms of depression.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.040
 Well, you might think, oh, well,

38:35.040 --> 38:37.800
 do you just give that person some drug to increase dopamine

38:37.800 --> 38:38.760
 and everything will be better?

38:38.760 --> 38:40.760
 And indeed, in some cases, that's true.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.120
 There are drugs like wellbutrin,

38:43.120 --> 38:46.660
 which function more specifically on the dopamine system

38:46.660 --> 38:47.660
 to increase dopamine,

38:47.660 --> 38:49.480
 and they also increase norepinephrine.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.560
 Many people get great relief from things like wellbutrin.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.480
 They don't really impact the serotonin system so much,

38:56.480 --> 38:58.880
 and therefore you don't get a lot of the serotonergic

38:58.880 --> 39:00.920
 or serotonin-related side effects.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.440
 However, some people feel far too anxious on those drugs.

39:04.440 --> 39:07.400
 Some people get addicted to those drugs in a way,

39:07.400 --> 39:09.920
 because a lot of those drugs that increase dopamine

39:09.920 --> 39:11.640
 make you want more of those drugs.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.900
 So you start to realize that what makes sense on paper

39:13.900 --> 39:15.300
 doesn't always make sense clinically,

39:15.300 --> 39:16.480
 and this is why it's complicated,

39:16.480 --> 39:18.160
 and a really good psychologist

39:18.160 --> 39:19.840
 and a really good psychiatrist will work with someone

39:19.840 --> 39:22.400
 to try and pull and push on these various systems

39:22.400 --> 39:24.540
 to find the combination of drugs

39:24.540 --> 39:27.100
 that may be or may not be correct for them.

39:27.940 --> 39:31.180
 There's a fourth aspect of the chemistry of depression

39:31.180 --> 39:34.420
 that's really important to understand, and that's pain.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.480
 We've talked about pain on this podcast before,

39:36.480 --> 39:37.920
 but even if you didn't hear the episode

39:37.920 --> 39:39.200
 on pleasure and pain,

39:39.200 --> 39:41.080
 just want to emphasize that pain is something

39:41.080 --> 39:42.400
 that we experience in our body,

39:42.400 --> 39:45.100
 no surprise there, an injury, a cut, et cetera,

39:45.100 --> 39:47.280
 but that we also experience emotional pain,

39:47.280 --> 39:50.320
 and those systems are linked in very intricate ways.

39:51.580 --> 39:55.120
 There's actually some data showing that pain relievers,

39:55.120 --> 39:56.880
 Tylenol, aspirin, these sorts of things

39:56.880 --> 40:00.000
 can help certain people with emotional pain.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.360
 Now, I'm not recommending people run out

40:01.360 --> 40:03.200
 and take those things for emotional pain,

40:03.200 --> 40:04.240
 but actually, if you think about that,

40:04.240 --> 40:05.640
 it shouldn't come as any surprise

40:05.640 --> 40:09.040
 given the enormous number of people that take painkillers,

40:09.040 --> 40:10.360
 opioids, and things like them

40:10.360 --> 40:12.240
 to try and relieve their psychological pain,

40:12.240 --> 40:16.380
 and as we know, those drugs are very, very problematic

40:16.380 --> 40:18.080
 for many individuals.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.320
 They can help certain individuals,

40:19.320 --> 40:21.720
 but they are very prone to abuse,

40:21.720 --> 40:24.040
 and they can induce addiction very easily

40:24.040 --> 40:25.320
 in a number of people.

40:25.320 --> 40:29.440
 There's a substance that's literally called substance P,

40:29.440 --> 40:32.880
 the letter P, that's manufactured by neurons

40:32.880 --> 40:34.360
 in our brain and body, which underlies

40:34.360 --> 40:36.020
 our sensation of pain, and indeed,

40:36.020 --> 40:39.740
 substance P inhibitors have been used to treat depression,

40:39.740 --> 40:41.360
 and in some cases, works.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.920
 A lot of people with depression are hypersensitive to pain,

40:44.920 --> 40:46.880
 and of course, they could have multiple things going on.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.880
 They could have chronic pain or chronic injury

40:48.880 --> 40:50.320
 and major depression.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.720
 So you start to get the constellation

40:51.720 --> 40:53.880
 of the many things that could happen.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.960
 So that's all I want to say today

40:55.960 --> 40:59.840
 about the chemistry underlying depression

40:59.840 --> 41:01.160
 or major depression.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.160
 There's a lot more there,

41:02.160 --> 41:04.640
 but I think if you understand the norepinephrine system

41:04.640 --> 41:08.560
 and that it relates to some of these things like lethargy,

41:08.560 --> 41:11.560
 the psychomotor defects, as they're called,

41:11.560 --> 41:13.960
 dopamine and how it relates to motivation

41:13.960 --> 41:16.960
 and lack of motivation and lack of dopamine and depression,

41:16.960 --> 41:20.280
 and serotonin and its relationship to grief,

41:20.280 --> 41:23.480
 and that low serotonin can lead to extreme grief and shame,

41:23.480 --> 41:25.960
 and higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore

41:25.960 --> 41:27.880
 a sense of wellbeing and safety

41:27.880 --> 41:29.680
 and feeling good about oneself.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.680
 If you understand that and you understand that physical pain

41:32.680 --> 41:34.400
 is somehow involved in certain cases,

41:34.400 --> 41:37.280
 I think you will know more about depression

41:37.280 --> 41:39.840
 and its underlying chemistry than most all people out there.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.840
 And if you'd like to learn more,

41:40.840 --> 41:44.160
 I invite you to pursue searching those terms

41:44.160 --> 41:45.360
 further on the internet,

41:45.360 --> 41:47.080
 and we'll certainly go into them in more depth,

41:47.080 --> 41:50.140
 but that really sets the stage for where we're headed next.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.780
 So next, I'd like to talk about hormones

41:51.780 --> 41:53.920
 and how they relate to depression.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.740
 And I'd also like to talk about stress

41:55.740 --> 41:57.380
 and how it relates to depression,

41:57.380 --> 41:59.440
 as well as talk about some of the genetics

41:59.440 --> 42:02.720
 or the predispositions to depression.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.940
 And for those of you that are thinking,

42:03.940 --> 42:07.080
 hey, I want the tools, I want to know how to fix depression.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.720
 I understand the desire for that.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.760
 I will just ask if you hang in here with me

42:11.760 --> 42:14.040
 a little bit longer, not only will you learn a lot more

42:14.040 --> 42:18.000
 about how this complicated mood disorder works,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.240
 some of the more interesting things about it,

42:20.240 --> 42:22.440
 but it will also position you to get a lot more

42:22.440 --> 42:24.480
 out of the tools that we will describe.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.400
 You always have the option to skip forward, of course,

42:26.400 --> 42:28.280
 but I think it's important to understand

42:28.280 --> 42:29.920
 some of the hormonal and stress-related

42:29.920 --> 42:31.520
 aspects of depression.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.100
 So let's talk about hormones.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.200
 20% of people that have major depression

42:37.200 --> 42:39.320
 have low thyroid hormone.

42:39.320 --> 42:42.080
 Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.640
 Oftentimes we think about thyroid

42:43.640 --> 42:47.240
 as only related to having a fast metabolism,

42:47.240 --> 42:50.320
 but thyroid is related to all forms of metabolism,

42:50.320 --> 42:52.800
 including our ability to synthesize new tissues

42:52.800 --> 42:55.440
 like protein and repair injuries.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.480
 I did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.480
 If you want to check that out,

42:59.480 --> 43:02.320
 all of that is archived at Hubermanlab.com.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.700
 It's all timestamped, et cetera.

43:03.700 --> 43:06.340
 You can find on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, all those places.

43:06.340 --> 43:07.900
 So if you're curious about thyroid hormone

43:07.900 --> 43:08.880
 and growth hormone,

43:08.880 --> 43:10.680
 and you want to do the deep dive on those,

43:10.680 --> 43:13.000
 and you want to learn how to alter their levels

43:13.000 --> 43:15.640
 using various approaches, check that out.

43:15.640 --> 43:20.360
 But 20% of people with major depression are hypothyroidal.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.240
 They don't make enough thyroid.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.240
 And that leads to low energy,

43:24.240 --> 43:27.280
 low metabolism in the brain and body.

43:27.280 --> 43:30.060
 And there's a condition called Hashimoto's,

43:30.060 --> 43:33.520
 which is essentially low thyroid output.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.800
 And again, I don't want to get into

43:34.800 --> 43:36.120
 all the tools related to thyroid.

43:36.120 --> 43:39.980
 Sometimes a psychiatrist will prescribe thyroid medication

43:39.980 --> 43:42.480
 to increase thyroid output in people that are depressed,

43:42.480 --> 43:44.520
 and that will work to relieve the symptoms.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.920
 So there isn't necessarily a direct problem

43:46.920 --> 43:49.000
 with serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine

43:49.000 --> 43:49.840
 or substance B.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.640
 Sometimes it's a thyroid problem.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.120
 So there are certain situations or conditions

43:54.120 --> 43:57.120
 that can impact the thyroid hormone system

43:57.120 --> 43:59.660
 and make people more susceptible to depression

43:59.660 --> 44:01.920
 or make a preexisting depression worse.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.360
 And those are things like childbirth.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.780
 So it's well known that women who give birth

44:06.780 --> 44:09.660
 can often undergo what's called postpartum depression.

44:09.660 --> 44:13.760
 It actually comes from the word postpartuition depression.

44:13.760 --> 44:17.460
 They give birth, what's happier, what's more joyful

44:17.460 --> 44:19.320
 than the birth of a new healthy child,

44:19.320 --> 44:20.900
 and they will lapse into a depression.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.360
 And that's thought to be hormonally related.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.960
 Either directly to the thyroid system

44:25.960 --> 44:27.760
 or perhaps to the cortisol system as well.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.440
 We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.960
 As well, certain women during certain phases

44:31.960 --> 44:34.940
 of their menstrual cycle experience symptoms

44:34.940 --> 44:37.760
 that are very much like clinical depression

44:37.760 --> 44:39.760
 and oftentimes are diagnosed

44:39.760 --> 44:42.100
 with clinical depression appropriately.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.680
 And of course the menstrual cycle is associated

44:43.680 --> 44:45.040
 with shifts in hormone levels.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.640
 As well, menopause and postmenopausal women

44:48.640 --> 44:51.480
 are more susceptible to major depression

44:51.480 --> 44:52.780
 regardless of whether or not they've had

44:52.780 --> 44:54.400
 that major depression earlier in their life.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.160
 So these are things to be on the lookout for

44:56.160 --> 44:59.160
 and to definitely talk to a doctor and get a blood panel

44:59.160 --> 45:01.700
 that hopefully includes measures of thyroid hormone

45:01.700 --> 45:02.680
 and cortisol hormone.

45:02.680 --> 45:03.800
 Why cortisol hormone?

45:03.800 --> 45:07.220
 Well, more stress is correlated with more bouts

45:07.220 --> 45:09.800
 of major depression across the lifespan.

45:09.800 --> 45:10.680
 How many bouts?

45:10.680 --> 45:13.480
 Well, it turns out that as you go

45:13.480 --> 45:15.280
 from having one to two to three,

45:15.280 --> 45:17.600
 well, when you hit four to five bouts

45:17.600 --> 45:20.720
 of really intense to stressful episodes in life,

45:20.720 --> 45:23.260
 these tend to be long-term stressful episodes,

45:23.260 --> 45:26.300
 your risk for major depression goes way up.

45:26.300 --> 45:28.840
 So whether or not you have a genetic predisposition

45:28.840 --> 45:31.080
 to depression or not,

45:31.080 --> 45:32.980
 one of the best things you can do

45:32.980 --> 45:34.520
 to try and avoid getting depressed

45:34.520 --> 45:37.480
 is to learn to control your stress system,

45:37.480 --> 45:39.880
 to not go from short-term stress,

45:39.880 --> 45:41.160
 which everybody experiences,

45:41.160 --> 45:43.220
 we all have short-term stressors,

45:43.220 --> 45:45.400
 to medium-term stress to long-term stress

45:45.400 --> 45:47.800
 and to not have too many bouts of long-term stress

45:47.800 --> 45:50.160
 because that probability of getting depressed

45:50.160 --> 45:51.400
 goes way, way up.

45:51.400 --> 45:54.360
 And this is something I've seen over and over again,

45:54.360 --> 45:55.760
 not just in my scientific career,

45:55.760 --> 45:56.880
 but just throughout life,

45:56.880 --> 45:59.520
 people in all sorts of domains, young and old,

45:59.520 --> 46:01.280
 I've seen that people will go

46:01.280 --> 46:05.460
 through a very intense relationship, a breakup.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.480
 Sometimes it's the staying together that's stressful.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.880
 Sometimes it's a graduate school that can be stressful.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.860
 Sometimes it's some other event.

46:12.860 --> 46:15.560
 And then some months later, they become depressed.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.820
 And that's because the stress system is associated

46:17.820 --> 46:19.240
 with the release of cortisol.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.720
 The cortisol system can dramatically impact

46:21.720 --> 46:23.880
 the way that these different neuromodulators,

46:23.880 --> 46:26.240
 dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin function.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.760
 And so there's this kind of latent

46:27.760 --> 46:31.600
 or longer lasting impact on the systems

46:31.600 --> 46:33.960
 that impact mood and wellbeing.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.400
 So learning how to control your stress is really key.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.920
 If you're not depressed or you're somebody

46:38.920 --> 46:42.020
 that has not lapsed into a depression recently,

46:42.020 --> 46:43.680
 take control of your stress system.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.560
 And we did an entire episode on how to conquer stress.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.880
 And that involves dealing with stress in the short-term,

46:48.880 --> 46:50.420
 the medium-term, and in the long-term.

46:50.420 --> 46:52.600
 And there are a lot of different ways to do that.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.620
 One of the more important reasons

46:54.620 --> 46:56.160
 for learning how to counter stress

46:56.160 --> 46:59.000
 in order to offset depression

46:59.000 --> 47:01.940
 is that there is a genetic predisposition

47:01.940 --> 47:04.520
 that certain people carry to become depressed.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.160
 There are these studies now

47:06.160 --> 47:08.260
 of many, many thousands of individuals.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.880
 These were mainly done in New Zealand,

47:09.880 --> 47:12.160
 but these studies have now been done elsewhere,

47:12.160 --> 47:15.460
 looking at many tens of thousands of individuals

47:15.460 --> 47:18.680
 who carry particular copies of genes,

47:18.680 --> 47:20.560
 what they call polymorphisms,

47:20.560 --> 47:24.980
 in particular of a gene called 5-HTTLPR,

47:24.980 --> 47:27.320
 which is a serotonin transporter.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.880
 So this is a gene that controls or regulates

47:29.880 --> 47:32.640
 how much serotonin is available in the brain.

47:32.640 --> 47:36.080
 If you have this gene, this polymorphism,

47:36.080 --> 47:38.440
 it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be depressed,

47:38.440 --> 47:42.560
 but it greatly shifts your susceptibility

47:42.560 --> 47:45.200
 to depression under conditions of stress.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.240
 So I realize some people are listening to this

47:47.240 --> 47:48.680
 and some people are watching it on YouTube,

47:48.680 --> 47:49.840
 so I'm going to describe this in a way

47:49.840 --> 47:51.960
 that doesn't require looking at any graphs.

47:51.960 --> 47:56.200
 What I want you to imagine is a very shallow hill,

47:56.200 --> 47:58.100
 like a very mellow hill.

47:58.100 --> 48:02.680
 It's just a ramp set at about 10 or 15 degrees, okay?

48:02.680 --> 48:04.640
 What we're plotting there in your mind

48:04.640 --> 48:09.640
 is that with each bout of serious stress,

48:09.900 --> 48:11.520
 so that could be trying to finish a degree

48:11.520 --> 48:15.000
 or a relationship breakup or a family member that's sick

48:15.000 --> 48:16.720
 or the loss of a loved one or a pet,

48:16.720 --> 48:18.960
 with each bout of stress,

48:18.960 --> 48:20.720
 the probability that you will experience

48:20.720 --> 48:23.040
 a major depression goes up.

48:23.040 --> 48:28.040
 However, if you carry this gene, this HTTLPR gene,

48:29.840 --> 48:33.360
 the steepness of that curve goes way, way up,

48:33.360 --> 48:35.040
 or it's actually more like a line,

48:35.040 --> 48:39.480
 such that you need far fewer bouts of stress

48:39.480 --> 48:42.360
 in order to lapse into a major depression, okay?

48:42.360 --> 48:46.000
 So if the typical person who doesn't carry this polymorphism

48:46.000 --> 48:48.840
 has to experience two or three or four or five bouts

48:48.840 --> 48:51.920
 of stress before they lapse into a depression,

48:51.920 --> 48:55.440
 somebody with this gene is susceptible to getting depression

48:55.440 --> 48:59.200
 after just one bout or two bouts of intense stress, okay?

48:59.200 --> 49:01.160
 So that's how these genes work.

49:01.160 --> 49:05.800
 They don't preordain or determine you to be depressed.

49:05.800 --> 49:09.040
 They raise a susceptibility, and many in genes,

49:09.040 --> 49:11.600
 many things related to heritability in general

49:11.600 --> 49:13.100
 work in that way.

49:13.100 --> 49:16.040
 And we know there's a strong genetic component to depression.

49:16.040 --> 49:16.880
 How do we know?

49:16.880 --> 49:21.080
 Well, in what are called concordant monozygotic twins.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.600
 So these would be identical twins,

49:23.600 --> 49:26.780
 and they can either be in one biological sac

49:26.780 --> 49:30.080
 or two biological sacs while in utero,

49:30.080 --> 49:32.800
 what's called a monochorionic or dichorionic.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.600
 Well, typically it's monochorionic,

49:35.600 --> 49:39.560
 and identical twins for which one of those twins

49:39.560 --> 49:41.020
 goes on to have major depression,

49:41.020 --> 49:43.440
 there's a 50% probability that the other one

49:43.440 --> 49:44.600
 will have major depression.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.640
 So it's not 100%.

49:45.640 --> 49:48.160
 It's not 100% inherited.

49:48.160 --> 49:50.880
 It's not 100% genetic, as you might say,

49:50.880 --> 49:55.680
 but there's a much higher predisposition for depression.

49:55.680 --> 49:59.520
 Whereas in fraternal twins, that number drops,

49:59.520 --> 50:02.640
 and in siblings, that number drops to about 25%,

50:02.640 --> 50:05.380
 and in half siblings, it's about 10%.

50:05.380 --> 50:07.120
 The numbers vary from study to study,

50:07.120 --> 50:09.220
 but basically the more closely related you are

50:09.220 --> 50:11.460
 to somebody who has major depression,

50:11.460 --> 50:13.040
 the more likely it is

50:13.040 --> 50:14.520
 that you will also get major depression,

50:14.520 --> 50:17.100
 and therefore, if you haven't gotten major depression,

50:17.100 --> 50:20.600
 the more likely it is that you should take steps

50:20.600 --> 50:22.640
 to learn to mitigate stress,

50:22.640 --> 50:24.120
 because stress is the major factor

50:24.120 --> 50:27.120
 that can trigger one of these depressive episodes.

50:27.120 --> 50:32.120
 Okay, so we've covered a lot related to the stress

50:32.560 --> 50:35.840
 and the hormones and the neurochemistry of depression.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.560
 In fact, I think this is probably the deepest

50:37.560 --> 50:40.280
 I've ever gone into the biology of any topic

50:40.280 --> 50:43.680
 on this podcast before getting to any specific tools.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.640
 I mentioned that learning how to mitigate stress

50:45.640 --> 50:47.720
 and deal with stress, learning how to measure

50:47.720 --> 50:50.460
 and adjust your thyroid hormone, those might be useful,

50:50.460 --> 50:53.800
 but next I'd like to turn to some very specific tools

50:53.800 --> 50:57.120
 that people who both have depression

50:57.120 --> 50:58.580
 or who are prone to depression,

50:58.580 --> 51:00.020
 as well as people who don't have depression

51:00.020 --> 51:02.540
 and simply want to maintain a good mood,

51:02.540 --> 51:04.320
 who want to maintain a positive affect

51:04.320 --> 51:05.880
 and pursuit of things in life,

51:05.880 --> 51:07.360
 what are the things that you can do?

51:07.360 --> 51:08.940
 Turns out there are things that you can do

51:08.940 --> 51:11.880
 and all of the biology that underlies

51:11.880 --> 51:14.180
 the utility of those things,

51:14.180 --> 51:16.420
 meaning the reasons those things work

51:16.420 --> 51:17.640
 will now make sense to you

51:17.640 --> 51:20.640
 because they adjust things like serotonin and dopamine

51:20.640 --> 51:23.280
 and they adjust them through very specific pathways.

51:24.180 --> 51:25.680
 I know for many people,

51:25.680 --> 51:27.760
 learning about mechanism is kind of grueling.

51:27.760 --> 51:29.840
 I realize this podcast isn't necessarily one

51:29.840 --> 51:32.280
 that you can listen to passively while doing other things,

51:32.280 --> 51:34.760
 although I would hope that you could do that

51:34.760 --> 51:37.240
 and still enjoy it and extract the information.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.160
 Why mechanism?

51:38.160 --> 51:41.360
 Mechanism is so key because mechanism

51:41.360 --> 51:42.920
 is a little bit like understanding

51:42.920 --> 51:44.520
 some of the chemistry of cooking.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.840
 If you read a recipe and you can follow a recipe,

51:48.840 --> 51:52.440
 you often hear people say, oh, I can follow a recipe.

51:52.440 --> 51:55.440
 That means that if you have every ingredient in that recipe,

51:55.440 --> 51:58.000
 you're good, you likely can make that dish,

51:58.000 --> 51:59.700
 you can make that meal.

51:59.700 --> 52:02.320
 However, if you understand a little bit of the chemistry

52:02.320 --> 52:06.820
 of why salt has to be added third and not first,

52:06.820 --> 52:09.800
 or why the heat has to be adjusted at a particular time,

52:09.800 --> 52:12.140
 well, then not only can you follow a recipe,

52:12.140 --> 52:13.680
 but that also gives you flexibility

52:13.680 --> 52:15.540
 for when salt isn't available,

52:15.540 --> 52:18.340
 or when you want to adjust the flavor of the dish,

52:18.340 --> 52:20.480
 or when you want to try a new dish

52:20.480 --> 52:21.640
 or you want to get experimental.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.100
 So when you understand mechanism,

52:23.100 --> 52:25.800
 it puts you in a tremendous place of power

52:25.800 --> 52:27.520
 to work with your system.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.880
 So it's not just plug and chug,

52:28.880 --> 52:31.680
 like take 12 milligrams of this,

52:31.680 --> 52:33.280
 you either feel better or you don't,

52:33.280 --> 52:37.080
 you can really start to understand how prescription drugs,

52:37.080 --> 52:41.480
 supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,

52:41.480 --> 52:43.960
 how those things weave together to either work for you

52:43.960 --> 52:46.340
 or not work for you and get you to paths

52:46.340 --> 52:49.160
 of healthy mind and body.

52:49.160 --> 52:51.980
 So let's think about why any tool would work

52:51.980 --> 52:53.520
 to relieve depression.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.920
 We've talked about how some of the drugs

52:54.920 --> 52:57.280
 that impact these different chemical systems might work

52:57.280 --> 53:00.200
 and why they create some of the problems they create.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.760
 The problems are mainly created by the fact

53:01.760 --> 53:04.520
 that they impact lots of systems in the brain and body.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.840
 So you take a drug to increase serotonin,

53:06.840 --> 53:10.240
 but that serotonin is also related not just to mood,

53:10.240 --> 53:12.480
 but to things related to libido and appetite.

53:12.480 --> 53:15.040
 And so you start disrupting multiple systems.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.140
 You know, the same could be said for behavioral tools,

53:18.140 --> 53:18.960
 right?

53:18.960 --> 53:22.180
 That any behavioral tool that adjusts the levels

53:22.180 --> 53:25.880
 of a particular chemical ought to perhaps provide

53:25.880 --> 53:28.720
 some relief for some of the symptoms of major depression.

53:28.720 --> 53:31.600
 Let's take an example that I've talked about before

53:31.600 --> 53:32.640
 on the podcast, which is,

53:32.640 --> 53:35.640
 if you get into a very cold shower, you take an ice bath,

53:35.640 --> 53:38.080
 you will release norepinephrine and epinephrine

53:38.080 --> 53:38.920
 in your brain and body.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.920
 There's no question about that.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.020
 I don't think anyone can really escape that.

53:43.020 --> 53:46.680
 It's a kind of a universal response to being in cold water.

53:46.680 --> 53:50.160
 Well, if some aspects of depression are related

53:50.160 --> 53:52.240
 to low levels of norepinephrine,

53:52.240 --> 53:55.660
 will taking cold showers relieve your depression?

53:55.660 --> 53:56.500
 Perhaps.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.920
 It might even relieve certain aspects of that depression.

53:58.920 --> 53:59.760
 Is it a cure?

53:59.760 --> 54:02.040
 Well, that's going to depend on the individual.

54:02.960 --> 54:04.000
 Will exercise help?

54:04.000 --> 54:05.680
 Well, if you go out for a run,

54:05.680 --> 54:07.920
 you're going to increase the amount of norepinephrine

54:07.920 --> 54:09.080
 in your body.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.980
 If you enjoy that run,

54:10.980 --> 54:13.760
 it's likely that you'll increase the levels of dopamine

54:13.760 --> 54:16.840
 and probably serotonin in your brain and body as well.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.000
 Will that cure your depression?

54:18.000 --> 54:21.040
 Well, there are a lot of studies exploring how exercise

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
 can impact depression.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.520
 And indeed, regular exercise is known

54:24.520 --> 54:28.000
 to be a protective behavior against depression,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.180
 but it also can help relieve some of the symptoms

54:31.180 --> 54:32.460
 of depression.

54:32.460 --> 54:35.420
 So you may ask yourself, why would you need drugs at all?

54:35.420 --> 54:37.520
 Why would there be prescription drugs

54:37.520 --> 54:39.580
 or the need for supplementation or other things

54:39.580 --> 54:41.600
 to alleviate the symptoms of depression?

54:41.600 --> 54:44.900
 Ah, well, that's the diabolical nature of depression,

54:44.900 --> 54:49.860
 which is if people are far enough along in this thing,

54:49.860 --> 54:52.500
 this sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,

54:52.500 --> 54:54.580
 but major depression,

54:54.580 --> 54:57.640
 oftentimes they can't get the energy

54:57.640 --> 55:00.800
 to even get up and take a bath or a shower.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.100
 They have no motivation to do it.

55:03.100 --> 55:05.160
 They have no desire to go for a run.

55:05.160 --> 55:06.880
 So you say, come on, let's go, you'll feel better.

55:06.880 --> 55:07.720
 I know you feel better.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.940
 It generates all these chemicals.

55:08.940 --> 55:11.140
 I heard on the whatever podcast,

55:11.140 --> 55:12.820
 Huberman Lab podcast or another podcast

55:12.820 --> 55:15.380
 that getting into action does all these things

55:15.380 --> 55:16.660
 and they just don't want to do it.

55:16.660 --> 55:20.180
 And to you, a person who's not experiencing depression,

55:20.180 --> 55:22.020
 that perhaps could just seem like the most frustrating

55:22.020 --> 55:23.660
 and confusing thing in the world,

55:23.660 --> 55:25.420
 but it's very important to highlight the fact

55:25.420 --> 55:29.060
 that these circuits that are accessible to some of us,

55:29.060 --> 55:31.660
 the circuits for happiness, for pursuit of pleasure,

55:31.660 --> 55:36.360
 for exercise, for getting in a cold shower,

55:36.360 --> 55:37.580
 if that's your thing,

55:37.580 --> 55:40.940
 that those circuits are present in all people,

55:40.940 --> 55:42.540
 but for certain people

55:42.540 --> 55:44.160
 that are experiencing major depression

55:44.160 --> 55:46.960
 and are really in the depths of their depression,

55:46.960 --> 55:50.620
 they can't really access those circuits in the same way

55:50.620 --> 55:54.180
 that people who are not suffering from depression can.

55:54.180 --> 55:55.180
 So I hope that makes it clear.

55:55.180 --> 55:57.380
 It's not offering any excuses for them.

55:57.380 --> 56:01.780
 And indeed, I think those behaviors would help jolt them

56:01.780 --> 56:04.420
 out of some of the symptomology of depression,

56:04.420 --> 56:07.240
 but they're just not accessible to everybody.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.740
 So let's talk about the things that people can do

56:10.740 --> 56:12.220
 to deal with depression.

56:12.220 --> 56:15.700
 And again, anytime you add a behavior or a tool

56:15.700 --> 56:18.900
 or a supplement or subtract a behavior tool,

56:18.900 --> 56:19.980
 supplement, drug, et cetera,

56:19.980 --> 56:21.720
 you absolutely should talk to your physician,

56:21.720 --> 56:23.140
 especially if you're somebody

56:23.140 --> 56:25.180
 that's dealing with major depression.

56:25.180 --> 56:27.860
 I want to focus on the stress system,

56:27.860 --> 56:29.820
 and I'm not just going to tell you

56:29.820 --> 56:32.380
 to get sunlight in your eyes and to get a good night's sleep,

56:32.380 --> 56:33.940
 although I think everybody should do that

56:33.940 --> 56:36.640
 on a regular basis, ideally every day.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.960
 Talked about those ad nauseum on this podcast.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.140
 They will help your sleep.

56:40.140 --> 56:41.660
 They will help you alleviate stress.

56:41.660 --> 56:43.320
 I think you should have tools to deal with stress

56:43.320 --> 56:45.100
 in real time, et cetera.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.340
 But let's look at depression from the standpoint

56:47.340 --> 56:49.440
 of a deeper biological phenomenon,

56:49.440 --> 56:52.500
 which is inflammation and the immune system.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.360
 There's growing evidence now

56:54.360 --> 56:56.460
 that many forms of major depression,

56:56.460 --> 57:01.460
 if not all of them, relate to excessive inflammation.

57:01.540 --> 57:04.600
 Now, inflammation plays an important role in wound healing.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.580
 It is a positive aspect of our immune system,

57:07.580 --> 57:12.580
 our ability to combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera,

57:13.200 --> 57:15.640
 but inflammation gone unchecked,

57:15.640 --> 57:19.140
 inflammation that lasts too long or is of too high amplitude,

57:19.140 --> 57:23.340
 meaning too many anti-inflammatory or inflammatory cytokines

57:23.340 --> 57:25.920
 and things of that sort in the body is bad.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.940
 And there's decent evidence now

57:27.940 --> 57:32.340
 that inflammation can lead to or exacerbate depression.

57:32.340 --> 57:34.380
 And that if we want to control depression

57:34.380 --> 57:36.740
 or limit or eliminate depression,

57:36.740 --> 57:40.180
 that focusing on reducing inflammation

57:40.180 --> 57:42.840
 and its associated pathways is a really good thing to do.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.860
 And I think this is a really good thing

57:44.860 --> 57:47.300
 for everybody to do regardless of whether or not

57:47.300 --> 57:48.660
 you suffer from depression or not.

57:48.660 --> 57:50.380
 And today we're going to talk about exactly

57:50.380 --> 57:55.380
 how depression comes about through the inflammation pathway.

57:55.560 --> 57:59.340
 So first of all, who are the major players

57:59.340 --> 58:02.620
 in creating chronic inflammation in the brain and body?

58:02.620 --> 58:04.980
 They are the inflammatory cytokines,

58:04.980 --> 58:07.420
 things like IL-6, interleukin-6,

58:07.420 --> 58:11.660
 things like tumor necrosis alpha, TNF alpha,

58:11.660 --> 58:15.340
 things like C-reactive protein, all right?

58:15.340 --> 58:16.880
 Not all of these are cytokines.

58:16.880 --> 58:19.260
 You have interferons and your prostaglandins

58:19.260 --> 58:20.580
 and a lot of these things.

58:20.580 --> 58:23.580
 But when we are stressed, chronically stressed,

58:23.580 --> 58:24.860
 we get inflamed,

58:24.860 --> 58:27.780
 our brain and various locations in the brain become inflamed

58:27.780 --> 58:29.100
 because certain classes of cells,

58:29.100 --> 58:31.380
 in particular those glial cells,

58:31.380 --> 58:33.140
 the cells that are typically thought

58:33.140 --> 58:34.580
 to just be support cells,

58:34.580 --> 58:36.460
 those cells and their biochemistry

58:36.460 --> 58:39.140
 and their dialogue with the neurons of the brain and body

58:39.140 --> 58:40.580
 starts to become disrupted.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.100
 I may have mentioned it earlier, I don't recall,

58:44.100 --> 58:46.540
 but I certainly mentioned it in an earlier podcast

58:46.540 --> 58:49.080
 that adrenaline, epinephrine,

58:49.080 --> 58:50.260
 when it's released in the body,

58:50.260 --> 58:51.860
 it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier,

58:51.860 --> 58:53.460
 but there are certain things

58:53.460 --> 58:56.220
 that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier

58:56.220 --> 58:57.060
 when we are stressed.

58:57.060 --> 58:58.980
 Things like the E2 prostaglandins,

58:58.980 --> 59:01.100
 those cross the blood-brain barrier

59:01.100 --> 59:03.520
 and our blood and our brain,

59:03.520 --> 59:06.140
 therefore our brain and our body can communicate

59:06.140 --> 59:09.400
 because certain things can pass through this barrier

59:09.400 --> 59:11.240
 we call the BBB or the blood-brain barrier.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.400
 And also we have something called the glymphatic system,

59:13.400 --> 59:14.700
 which is really a plumbing system

59:14.700 --> 59:15.840
 that links the brain and body.

59:15.840 --> 59:19.540
 It's the link between the immune system and the brain.

59:19.540 --> 59:23.940
 Well, there is a set of actions that we can take

59:23.940 --> 59:26.420
 in order to limit inflammation.

59:26.420 --> 59:29.420
 And this has been shown in several quality

59:29.420 --> 59:32.620
 peer-reviewed studies now to reduce inflammation

59:32.620 --> 59:35.280
 and to relieve some, and in some cases,

59:35.280 --> 59:37.700
 all of the symptoms of major depression.

59:37.700 --> 59:41.660
 One of those approaches is to increase our intake

59:41.660 --> 59:44.460
 of so-called EPAs or essential fatty acids.

59:44.460 --> 59:49.200
 There's now a very long list of papers

59:49.200 --> 59:50.720
 in quality peer-reviewed journals

59:50.720 --> 59:54.960
 showing that when people ingest a certain level

59:54.960 --> 59:58.780
 of EPA omega-3 fatty acids,

59:58.780 --> 1:00:03.780
 the relief from depressive symptoms matches the SSRIs.

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:05.880
 That's incredible, right?

1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:08.300
 That essential fatty acids could relieve symptoms

1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:09.580
 of depression as well as some

1:00:09.580 --> 1:00:11.780
 of the prescription antidepressants.

1:00:11.780 --> 1:00:13.880
 Now, this doesn't necessarily mean you run off

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:15.680
 and stop taking your antidepressants

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:16.560
 if you've been prescribed them.

1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:17.400
 Please don't do that.

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:18.640
 Please talk to your physician.

1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:22.480
 And I should mention that some of these same studies

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:24.560
 have shown that increasing our intake

1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:25.960
 of these essential fatty acids,

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.840
 in particular the EPA variety of omega-3s,

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:35.680
 can lower the effective dose of things like SSRIs,

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:37.820
 meaning if we required a 50 milligram

1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:40.560
 or 40 milligram dose of fluoxetine,

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:42.840
 that one can get by on a lower dose

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:46.360
 and thereby perhaps not experience as many

1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:47.880
 or as severe side effects

1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:51.240
 by taking or supplementing with EPAs.

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:54.980
 Now, the threshold level seems to be about one gram,

1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:57.140
 a thousand milligrams of EPA.

1:00:57.140 --> 1:01:00.360
 So you will sometimes see on a bottle of krill oil

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:02.320
 or fish oil or any other source,

1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:07.280
 even plant source or other source of EPA,

1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:10.360
 that it's a thousand milligrams or 1200 milligrams.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:12.640
 But what's really important to look at is

1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:15.400
 whether or not there's more than a thousand milligrams

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:18.160
 of EPA, because the EPA in particular

1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:19.280
 is what's important here.

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:22.280
 And actually, in exploring some of the literature

1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:26.120
 on the effects of EPAs on cardiovascular health,

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:28.700
 as well as their effects on depression,

1:01:28.700 --> 1:01:31.960
 there's some interesting dose dependent responses

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:36.000
 such that people who took anywhere from 400 milligrams

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.200
 to 5,000 milligrams of EPAs

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.520
 achieved a variety of different benefits

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:43.260
 and in some cases, some side effects,

1:01:43.260 --> 1:01:44.400
 we'll talk about those.

1:01:45.300 --> 1:01:47.280
 And it does seem that this thousand milligrams

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.460
 is the critical threshold for benefiting

1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:52.720
 or getting some relief from depressive symptoms.

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:55.360
 But people who took two grams seem to do better.

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:57.680
 And in the cardiovascular health realm,

1:01:57.680 --> 1:01:59.680
 there it's a little more complicated.

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:03.080
 Some studies point to a very positive effect

1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:05.920
 on cardiovascular health by taking increasing amounts

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.160
 of EPA, others, not so much.

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:11.240
 The current data point to the fact

1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:13.880
 that for every gram of EPA that one ingest,

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:17.220
 there's about a 9% improvement in cardiovascular health.

1:02:17.220 --> 1:02:21.560
 The same dose dependent improvement on psychological health

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:25.600
 in combating depression can't really be stated.

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.200
 I wouldn't say that the more EPA you take,

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.220
 the better you're going to feel, so to speak.

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:32.760
 I don't think the data point to that.

1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:35.200
 However, it does seem that if you take a gram,

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.440
 a thousand milligrams or 2000 milligrams of EPA,

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:40.840
 there does seem to be some substantial relief

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:43.500
 for many people, which I emphasize many, not all,

1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:47.800
 for many people in major depressive symptoms.

1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:49.240
 So how would this work?

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:52.020
 Well, it turns out that these inflammatory cytokines,

1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:56.600
 they impact neurons and the circuits of the brain

1:02:56.600 --> 1:02:58.360
 that relate to things like serotonin,

1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:00.560
 dopamine, and norepinephrine.

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:03.280
 These inflammatory cytokines act in a variety

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:06.000
 of different ways, but they mainly act to inhibit

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.160
 the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine,

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:13.320
 or the synthesis of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:16.120
 And I'll give you one example of how EPAs

1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:18.080
 can positively impact this process.

1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:19.860
 And then it points to a second tool,

1:03:19.860 --> 1:03:22.760
 which is the proper utilization of exercise

1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:26.900
 to offset the effects of depression.

1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:29.420
 So now you should understand why having healthy levels

1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:32.760
 of serotonin is important for maintaining healthy mood.

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.840
 It's not responsible for all the aspects

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:37.980
 of having a healthy mood.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:39.560
 There's also dopamine and norepinephrine,

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:41.800
 but it is a very important one.

1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:44.000
 Dopamine, also called 5-HT,

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:50.560
 essentially derives from a precursor called tryptophan.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:54.800
 Tryptophan arrives into our system through our diet, okay?

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:56.800
 Tryptophan is an amino acid.

1:03:56.800 --> 1:03:59.600
 Tryptophan is found in turkey.

1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:01.640
 It's found in carbohydrates,

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:04.000
 and that should therefore raise the idea of,

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.080
 hmm, I wonder if one of the reasons why people

1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:08.560
 who are depressed have such an appetite for carbohydrate

1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.160
 laden foods is because they're trying to get more tryptophan

1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:13.960
 and therefore more serotonin.

1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:15.520
 And indeed that's the case.

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:19.800
 Tryptophan is eventually converted into serotonin.

1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:23.380
 However, if there's excessive amounts of inflammation,

1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:28.480
 these inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:31.640
 to not be converted so much into serotonin,

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:34.180
 but to be diverted down a different pathway.

1:04:34.180 --> 1:04:37.580
 The pathway involves something called IDO,

1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:42.580
 idolamine, which converts tryptophan into kynurene, okay?

1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:46.020
 Kynurene actually acts as a neurotoxin

1:04:46.980 --> 1:04:50.720
 by way of converting into something called quinolinic acid,

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:53.500
 okay, and quinolinic acid is pro-depressive.

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:55.940
 So if that seems like a complicated biochemical pathway,

1:04:55.940 --> 1:04:58.220
 what's basically happening here is that the tryptophan

1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:00.420
 that normally would be made into serotonin

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:03.700
 under conditions of inflammation is being diverted

1:05:03.700 --> 1:05:08.040
 into a neurotoxic pathway and ingestion of EPAs,

1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:11.140
 because it limits these inflammatory cytokines,

1:05:11.140 --> 1:05:13.840
 things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera,

1:05:15.460 --> 1:05:19.900
 can cause more of the tryptophan that one ingests

1:05:19.900 --> 1:05:21.920
 or has in their body to be diverted

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:23.800
 towards the serotonergic pathway.

1:05:25.620 --> 1:05:29.980
 Exercise, it turns out, also has a positive effect

1:05:29.980 --> 1:05:34.060
 on the tryptophan to serotonin conversion pathway.

1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:35.860
 And the way it does it is really interesting.

1:05:35.860 --> 1:05:38.540
 You now know that tryptophan can either be converted

1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:41.300
 into serotonin or it can be converted into this neurotoxin,

1:05:41.300 --> 1:05:42.580
 which is a bad thing.

1:05:43.820 --> 1:05:46.260
 Exercise, the activation of the muscles

1:05:46.260 --> 1:05:47.880
 through rhythmic repeated use,

1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:49.180
 in particular aerobic exercise,

1:05:49.180 --> 1:05:51.960
 but also resistance training has been shown to do this

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:56.960
 to some extent, tends to sequester or shuttle the kynurene

1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:59.720
 into the muscle so that it isn't converted

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:03.880
 into this neurotoxin that is pro-depression, okay?

1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:05.120
 There are a lot of steps in the pathway

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:08.080
 leading to depression, but what this essentially means

1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:12.400
 is that hitting a certain threshold level of EPA intake,

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:15.500
 whether by supplementation with fish oil or krill oil

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:16.920
 or through some plant source,

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:19.720
 if you're not into ingesting fish or krill,

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:23.840
 or trying to get up above that 1,000 milligram threshold

1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:25.940
 for EPA by ingesting particular food sources,

1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:27.040
 you certainly can do it through food,

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:28.560
 you don't have to supplement,

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.360
 but it's easier to do with supplements,

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:33.280
 that doing that will limit the inflammation

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:36.760
 that diverts tryptophan into this neurotoxic pathway

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:41.480
 and exercise as well augments this conversion

1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:45.880
 of tryptophan into serotonin because it takes this thing

1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:49.880
 that would potentially be a neurotoxin and it sequesters it,

1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:52.600
 it pulls it away so that it can't actually go have

1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:54.520
 its pro-depressive effects.

1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:57.000
 So you've got multiple steps here.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.200
 We're describing two tools,

1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:01.520
 increasing EPA and regular exercise

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:05.600
 as a way of increasing serotonin somewhat indirectly, right?

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:07.480
 It's by limiting this bad pathway

1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:10.200
 to promote the activity of a good pathway.

1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:12.460
 But from the data that are published

1:07:12.460 --> 1:07:13.820
 in quality peer-reviewed journals,

1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:15.720
 it really appears that this inflammation pathway

1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:19.240
 does function to increase depression through these pathways.

1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:21.360
 And so knowing that there are behavioral steps

1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:22.960
 and supplementation-based steps,

1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:26.960
 or if you prefer getting your EPAs from typical food,

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.560
 from nutritional approaches,

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:32.580
 I find that very reassuring that the mechanisms

1:07:32.580 --> 1:07:35.360
 all converge on a common pathway, serotonin.

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:38.800
 That gives me great peace of mind that when people say,

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:40.840
 hey, go out and go out for a run

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:42.600
 or you should get outdoors, exercise,

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:45.440
 or you should take fish oil or like the Scandinavians,

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:46.920
 do I have Scandinavian family members?

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:49.840
 And they are known to,

1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:52.280
 or I should say they are quite open about the fact

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.060
 that during the winter months in particular,

1:07:54.060 --> 1:07:55.920
 when depression is more likely,

1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:57.400
 but throughout the year, really,

1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:01.920
 they make an effort to regularly ingest high levels of EPA,

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:06.180
 either through ingesting fatty fish and its skin.

1:08:06.180 --> 1:08:08.520
 I'm not a particular fan of ingesting the skin of fatty fish

1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.740
 or by supplementing with cod liver oil

1:08:10.740 --> 1:08:11.880
 or other types of fish oil,

1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:14.560
 sardines and things of that sort, sardine oils.

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:15.800
 There are a number of different things out there

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.220
 that one could use.

1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:19.580
 So I find it very reassuring

1:08:19.580 --> 1:08:21.680
 that there's a common biochemical pathway

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:24.820
 that can explain why these things not just work,

1:08:24.820 --> 1:08:26.520
 but why they should work.

1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:28.060
 They should work because they operate

1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:30.540
 in the very same biochemical pathways

1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:34.680
 that antidepressants that are prescribed to people do.

1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:35.760
 So what does this mean for you?

1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:38.720
 Well, if you're somebody who suffers from major depression,

1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:41.040
 again, don't stop taking your prescribed medication,

1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:41.880
 talk to your doctor,

1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:46.880
 but talk to them perhaps about the EPAs and exercise

1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:48.360
 and how these things can impinge

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:50.160
 on the same biochemical pathways.

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:52.500
 If you're somebody who's not suffering from major depression,

1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:53.680
 I still think these pathways

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:55.480
 are really important to understand.

1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.180
 And actually knowing these pathways

1:08:57.180 --> 1:09:01.120
 is additional motivation to get regular exercise.

1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:02.560
 I think we all know that we should be getting

1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:05.800
 anywhere from 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:08.820
 of so-called zone two cardio for cardiovascular effects.

1:09:08.820 --> 1:09:10.720
 Zone two is the kind of mellowish cardio

1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:12.720
 where you can sort of hold a conversation

1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:14.320
 if you needed to, but it's a little bit tough.

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:16.560
 You're kind of sucking for air a little bit.

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:20.080
 And that's going to limit these depressive-like symptoms.

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:20.940
 I think in all of us,

1:09:20.940 --> 1:09:22.920
 I don't think that we should think of depression

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:24.720
 as a strict threshold.

1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:27.200
 I'm somebody who personally has made the choice

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.720
 to take 1,000 milligrams of EPA per day.

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:33.040
 I do that by supplementing fish oil.

1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:35.120
 There's debate out there as to whether or not

1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:39.860
 it's better to take EPA and DHA in particular ratios

1:09:39.860 --> 1:09:43.320
 and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,

1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:45.260
 which is the so-called bad cholesterol.

1:09:45.260 --> 1:09:46.980
 That's getting really down into the weeds,

1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:49.160
 and we can talk about that in a future episode.

1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.400
 But for myself, I notice a pretty substantial

1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:55.360
 positive effect of taking anywhere

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:58.440
 from 1,000 milligrams to 2,000 milligrams of EPA per day.

1:09:58.440 --> 1:09:59.740
 I do that through supplementation,

1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:02.080
 and I do strive to try and eat some fish,

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:04.680
 even though, frankly, I've never liked the taste of fish.

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:06.740
 For those of you that would like a little more detail

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:10.340
 or perhaps a lot more detail into the effects of EPA

1:10:10.340 --> 1:10:14.220
 on depression and in relieving depressive symptoms,

1:10:14.220 --> 1:10:17.120
 and if you want to get into the nitty gritty of it,

1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:20.760
 I invite you to go to examine.com, put in depression, EPA.

1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:24.860
 They list off and have links to 28 studies

1:10:24.860 --> 1:10:27.080
 on the effects of EPA on major depression.

1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:30.560
 If you go to PubMed, there are many, many studies

1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:33.960
 on this now that date back several decades, really.

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:39.280
 If you're interested in the specific effects of EPA

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:42.400
 as opposed to DHA, I want to point you towards

1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:45.160
 a particular study entitled, not surprisingly,

1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:48.240
 EPA, but not DHA, appears to be responsible

1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:51.000
 for the efficacy of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.200
 fatty acid supplementation in depression,

1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:55.960
 evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized control trials.

1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:58.080
 This is a really wonderful paper.

1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:02.240
 The author is Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.

1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:04.760
 It was published in 2009.

1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:08.080
 We will provide a link to this study in the caption,

1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:10.400
 and that study is really the one that, at least to me,

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:15.080
 points to why EPA in particular is what's effective,

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:19.240
 and that whether or not DHA is problematic or not

1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:22.200
 is a separate issue, but it's really the EPA

1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:25.160
 that one wants to hit a certain threshold level of

1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:28.160
 if one's goal is to get relief from depression

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:31.600
 or to keep depression at bay by keeping mood elevated,

1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:35.000
 which is why I take high-dose EPA.

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.240
 So we've got EPA, we've got exercise.

1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:40.580
 Now you understand how they work to adjust mood.

1:11:41.420 --> 1:11:44.620
 Now I want to talk about something that, at least for me,

1:11:44.620 --> 1:11:47.400
 was quite surprising when I first learned about it

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:50.400
 for sake of treatment of mood disorders,

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:52.160
 and that's creatine.

1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:54.900
 Creatine has a number of very important functions

1:11:54.900 --> 1:11:56.220
 throughout the body.

1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:59.620
 For those of you that are into resistance training,

1:11:59.620 --> 1:12:00.680
 and actually for those of you

1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:02.800
 that are into endurance training as well,

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:07.360
 creatine has achieved a lot of popularity in recent years

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:09.960
 because supplementation with creatine

1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:11.960
 can draw more water into muscles

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:14.820
 and can increase power output from muscles.

1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:18.240
 So it's something that does indeed work.

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:20.460
 There have been debates about whether or not

1:12:20.460 --> 1:12:21.700
 it's unhealthy for the kidneys

1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:24.480
 to take long-term creatine supplementation at high doses,

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.760
 and I invite you to go down that rabbit hole.

1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:29.460
 I think most people now accept the idea that,

1:12:29.460 --> 1:12:31.740
 for most people, not all, but for most people,

1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:33.720
 low-dose creatine supplementation of anywhere

1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:36.640
 from one gram to five grams per day

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.360
 can have a number of positive effects

1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:41.360
 on physical performance.

1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.000
 People with kidney issues, et cetera,

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.280
 need to be especially cautious,

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:46.960
 but creatine is interesting for that purpose.

1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:49.240
 However, there's also a so-called

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.520
 phosphocreatine system in the brain,

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:53.820
 and that phosphocreatine system

1:12:53.820 --> 1:12:55.460
 has everything to do with the dialogue

1:12:55.460 --> 1:12:58.700
 between neurons and these other cell types called glia,

1:12:58.700 --> 1:13:01.600
 and glia comprise several cell types,

1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:04.280
 microglia, astrocytes, et cetera,

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:06.640
 but the phosphocreatine system

1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:09.160
 in the forebrain in particular, in the front of our brain,

1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:13.520
 has been shown to be involved in regulation of mood

1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:17.960
 and some of the reward pathways, as well as in depression,

1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:22.260
 and there are now several studies, at least three,

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:25.980
 although there are probably more by time this comes out,

1:13:25.980 --> 1:13:27.960
 because they're coming out very quickly now,

1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:30.560
 at least three quality studies pointing to the fact

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:33.000
 that creatine supplementation

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.300
 doesn't just have these positive effects

1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:36.280
 on physical performance,

1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:40.980
 but can also be used as a way to increase mood

1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:44.100
 and to improve the symptoms of major depression.

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:46.640
 This has been now done

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:50.540
 in several double-blind placebo-controlled studies.

1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:54.040
 These studies have looked at women,

1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:57.500
 have looked at men, have looked at adolescents,

1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:01.440
 some of whom were taking SSRIs, some of whom were not.

1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:05.840
 They've done magnetic resonance spectroscopy,

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:08.840
 so spectroscopy is a way that you can look

1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:11.520
 at the concentrations of particular compounds

1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:13.960
 in the brain in real time in humans.

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:15.640
 It can be used for other things as well, of course,

1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:17.920
 and basically what's been observed

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:20.280
 is that increasing the activity

1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:22.720
 of the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain

1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:25.240
 can be beneficial, or at least is correlated

1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:27.160
 with improvements in mood.

1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:29.740
 So let's just talk for a moment about what's involved

1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:32.400
 with using or supplementing creatine

1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:34.360
 in order to improve mood

1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:36.120
 and perhaps even treat depression.

1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:39.140
 First of all, when I talk about creatine,

1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:42.680
 I'm talking about creatine monohydrate.

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:44.320
 There are a number of different forms of creatine.

1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:47.260
 Here, I'm talking about creatine monohydrate.

1:14:47.260 --> 1:14:52.260
 The American Journal of Psychiatry in 2012 published a study

1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:54.760
 which was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial

1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:56.880
 of oral creatine monohydrate,

1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:59.440
 and what it found is that it could augment

1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:00.760
 or enhance the response

1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:03.520
 to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,

1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:06.320
 in particular, in women with major depressive disorder.

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:11.400
 So like EPA, creatine supplementation seems

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:14.680
 to either lower the required dose of SSRI

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:16.540
 that's required to treat depression

1:15:16.540 --> 1:15:21.540
 or can improve the effectiveness of a given dose of SSRI.

1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:23.960
 However, there are other studies

1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:26.480
 that have looked directly at creatine supplementation

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:29.360
 in the absence of SSRIs, and those are interesting as well.

1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:32.760
 There's a wonderful and very comprehensive review

1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:35.760
 on creatine for the treatment of major depression

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:39.340
 that includes beautiful tables of all the subjects

1:15:39.340 --> 1:15:40.560
 and the dosages, et cetera.

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:42.480
 I'm not going to read off every line

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:46.160
 and every column in that review,

1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:48.660
 but we will provide a link to that review as well.

1:15:50.220 --> 1:15:51.960
 One of the things that's really striking

1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:54.960
 about the lists of studies that they include is

1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:58.080
 that most of them used dosages

1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:00.960
 that are pretty reasonable for most people,

1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:04.800
 anywhere from three grams to five grams,

1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:08.960
 sometimes up to as many 10 grams per day of creatine.

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:12.980
 Many of these also were shown to increase activity

1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:16.040
 of this phosphocreatine system in the forebrain,

1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:18.600
 and some show a relationship

1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:21.240
 between that phosphocreatine system

1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:24.000
 and a particular category of receptors

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.520
 in the brain called the NMDA receptor,

1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:31.000
 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.080
 The NMDA receptor is one of the first things

1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:38.000
 that every budding neuroscientist learns about

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.160
 because it is the receptor that has particular electrical

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:46.600
 and chemical properties that make it a critical gate

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:48.960
 for so-called neuroplasticity.

1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:52.360
 So it's not a receptor that's activated in the brain

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:56.320
 typically for just the functioning of the brain

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:57.680
 on a day-to-day basis.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:59.240
 It's a receptor that's activated

1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:01.900
 when circuits are going to change,

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:03.780
 when they are inspired to change

1:17:03.780 --> 1:17:07.440
 by some very strong stimulus, meaning some experience,

1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:11.420
 or in some cases a drug, or in some cases something else.

1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:15.780
 But the NMDA receptor is a kind of a key node

1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.340
 for shifting brain circuitry.

1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:20.100
 And so while the details aren't entirely clear,

1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:24.360
 it seems that creatine supplementation leads to increases

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:27.760
 in the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain.

1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:30.520
 And that increases in the activity

1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:34.320
 of the forebrain phosphocreatine system relate to changes

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:36.960
 in the way the NMDA receptors function

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:38.840
 and may lead to some of the plasticity,

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:42.140
 the changes in neural circuits that underlie the shift

1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:44.960
 from negative mood and affect to positive mood.

1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:46.040
 Now, there are a lot of gaps.

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:48.580
 Those are, you know, there are a lot of little boxes

1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:50.880
 or bins in the diagram I just laid out for you.

1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:53.660
 And some of them are still truly black boxes, as we say,

1:17:53.660 --> 1:17:55.680
 meaning we don't really know what's in them yet.

1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:57.400
 And more mechanistic data are coming.

1:17:57.400 --> 1:17:59.600
 However, when you look over the data in this review,

1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:01.900
 or when I look over the data in this review,

1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:04.080
 what you find is that there are pretty striking

1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:07.400
 positive effects of creatine.

1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:11.260
 And one of the more interesting effects is that

1:18:11.260 --> 1:18:15.180
 creatine has actually been shown to increase mania

1:18:15.180 --> 1:18:18.660
 in people that are already manic.

1:18:18.660 --> 1:18:19.740
 And that's interesting.

1:18:19.740 --> 1:18:22.000
 We're not talking about bipolar depression today,

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.480
 but it seems that creatine elevates levels of activation

1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:26.620
 and kind of mood overall.

1:18:26.620 --> 1:18:28.140
 And you could see why that would be a problem

1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:29.960
 for somebody that's already in a manic phase,

1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:32.520
 but it actually might be beneficial for somebody

1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:37.200
 who is very low affect and has major depression.

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.200
 So should you supplement with creatine?

1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:42.560
 Well, as always, talk to your healthcare provider.

1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:45.760
 But if you're somebody who is thinking about things

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:48.000
 that you can do and things that you can take

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.680
 in order to improve your mood, keep depression at bay,

1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:55.680
 maybe even support other treatments for major depression,

1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:58.720
 the creatine system seems like a logical one.

1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:01.680
 There's at least strong studies

1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:03.800
 and a good number of them to look to

1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:06.240
 to determine whether or not that's right for you.

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:10.500
 I personally take five grams of creatine for other reasons.

1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:15.500
 I take it for the physical performance enhancing effects,

1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:17.700
 but it's kind of nice to think that perhaps

1:19:17.700 --> 1:19:19.780
 it's also helping me improve my mood.

1:19:19.780 --> 1:19:21.140
 That's a choice that I've made for me

1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:24.120
 as in within the margins of safety for me in my life.

1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:26.040
 I don't know that it's right for everybody,

1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:27.860
 but I find it very interesting.

1:19:27.860 --> 1:19:29.900
 And again, I find it particularly interesting

1:19:29.900 --> 1:19:32.800
 because there's a logical biochemical pathway

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:35.200
 to support the finding that it improves mood

1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:37.640
 and can offset the effects of major depression

1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:40.120
 in some cases, or can improve the effects

1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:44.000
 of antidepressant medication in many cases.

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.260
 When I see mechanism and I see effectiveness

1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:49.580
 and the mechanism and the effectiveness map

1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:51.200
 to a lot of the same mechanisms

1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:52.720
 that are involved in prescription drugs,

1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:54.400
 that gives me great reassurance

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:58.240
 that this isn't just some sort of mysterious pathway

1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:01.580
 or mysterious compound by which creatine might be working.

1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:06.040
 So now we've clustered together EPA's exercise

1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:07.880
 and their relationship to inflammation,

1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:11.320
 creatine and its relationship to forebrain function

1:20:11.320 --> 1:20:15.920
 and the phosphocreatine system and this NMDA receptor.

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:17.080
 And as you'll see in a few minutes,

1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:20.520
 that NMDA receptor turns out to be vitally important

1:20:20.520 --> 1:20:23.600
 and is actually one of the main nodes of action

1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:26.160
 for some of the more novel and exciting therapeutics

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:29.800
 that are being explored now in psychiatric clinics.

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:33.200
 So let's talk a little bit more about this NMDA receptor

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:36.720
 and how it relates to some of the more experimental

1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:38.600
 or novel therapeutic compounds

1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:40.200
 for the treatment of major depression.

1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:43.620
 And the compounds that we're going to be talking about,

1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:45.140
 you may have heard of before,

1:20:45.140 --> 1:20:48.840
 one is ketamine, which is getting increasing interest

1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:52.440
 in psychiatric clinics and in various experimental

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:55.840
 and clinical studies, and the other is PCP.

1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:59.920
 Both ketamine and PCP are known drugs of abuse.

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:02.540
 For many years, people have abused these drugs,

1:21:02.540 --> 1:21:05.440
 go by the street name Special K, et cetera,

1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:08.880
 and they create dissociative anesthetic states.

1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:12.080
 So dissociative states where people don't feel

1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:15.200
 as closely meshed with their emotions

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:16.640
 and their perceptions.

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:22.340
 It's an odd state, I hear, and it's an odd state

1:21:22.340 --> 1:21:24.080
 that clinicians are now leveraging

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:25.400
 for the treatment of depression.

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:26.680
 We'll talk about why that is,

1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:29.560
 but let's talk a little bit about this NMDA receptor

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:32.760
 and why ketamine and PCP might work

1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:35.840
 for the treatment of depression or how they even could work.

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:40.160
 I want to be very direct that this is an area

1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:42.960
 that still needs a lot of data.

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:44.880
 There are, however, some excellent papers

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.940
 from really terrific groups.

1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:49.560
 One of them is a paper that was published

1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:52.100
 in Nature last year, 2020.

1:21:52.100 --> 1:21:56.080
 First author is Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A,

1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:57.760
 and the last author and the lead on the study

1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:02.420
 was Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who was a guest

1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:05.600
 on the Huberman Lab podcast a few months ago.

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:07.560
 He's a world expert in neuroscience.

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:12.480
 He's a psychiatrist, and this paper from Sam Vesuna

1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:15.120
 and Karl and colleagues explored

1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:17.100
 how these dissociative states come about,

1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:20.400
 and they looked at this both in animals and in humans

1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:23.800
 and found that there was essentially a common mechanism

1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:27.360
 whereby a particular layer of cortex,

1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:31.480
 so your brain has this outer shell of tissue

1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:33.160
 that is called the neocortex.

1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.360
 It's where our perceptions lie.

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:37.320
 It's where our associations lie.

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:39.760
 It's a very important area for processing,

1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:41.860
 decision-making and planning, et cetera.

1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:45.240
 It's literally stacks of cells,

1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:48.960
 and one of those layers in the stack of cells is layer five,

1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.940
 and the layer five neurons in particular

1:22:50.940 --> 1:22:54.040
 went into a particular rhythm of electrical activity,

1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:56.400
 this one to three hertz rhythm,

1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:01.400
 after mice or humans were administered ketamine or PCP.

1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:07.040
 There was activation of a particular area of the brain.

1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:09.720
 This retrosplenial cortex, as it's called,

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:14.120
 and the dissociative state that emerged

1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:17.840
 was an interesting one, and clinically what's described

1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:21.480
 in the trials for ketamine and things like it,

1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:25.200
 that people who are depressed will take ketamine,

1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:28.080
 will experience a kind of separateness

1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:31.040
 from their grief and from their emotions,

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.660
 and that possibly there's plasticity.

1:23:33.660 --> 1:23:35.680
 There are actually shifts in the neural circuitry

1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:39.600
 such that their emotions don't weigh on them so heavily.

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.760
 I'm using very loose language here,

1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:45.640
 but that they don't feel as overridden

1:23:45.640 --> 1:23:48.320
 or as burdened by their own emotions

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:50.720
 as they did previously to the ketamine therapy.

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:53.120
 Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form,

1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:55.160
 in my suggestion that people run out and take ketamine

1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:56.960
 in order to treat their own depression,

1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:00.500
 these drugs are still very much experimental,

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:03.980
 although they are approved in certain contexts,

1:24:03.980 --> 1:24:06.720
 at least in the US, by prescription

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:09.200
 for the treatment of depression.

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:13.360
 What's interesting to me is that these dissociative states

1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:15.780
 sound, at least at the outset,

1:24:15.780 --> 1:24:20.120
 to be more of a separateness from everything.

1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:22.360
 It sounds a little bit like depression itself.

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:24.520
 It's sort of like anhedonia,

1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:27.320
 an inability to experience pleasure,

1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:30.500
 and then one takes a dissociative anesthetic

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:32.940
 and somehow is able to get relief

1:24:32.940 --> 1:24:36.000
 by getting even further away from an experience.

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.600
 To me, that doesn't make sense,

1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:40.740
 but that just speaks to the fact that these drugs

1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:43.640
 and these receptors and these pathways

1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:46.680
 operate through very cryptic means,

1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:49.060
 and we really don't understand all the pathways in the brain

1:24:49.060 --> 1:24:51.760
 that relate to motivation and mood and so forth.

1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:53.500
 And the results with these ketamine trials

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.600
 are looking very promising.

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:58.400
 In fact, there are a number of trials that show

1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:01.240
 that a fair number of people that take ketamine

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.040
 in a therapeutic setting legally

1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:05.920
 with a psychiatrist guiding the experience

1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:08.520
 are able to get relief from their symptoms

1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:12.080
 without the need for many, many treatments with the drug.

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:14.640
 Just how many treatments varies

1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:15.880
 from individual to individual,

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:18.440
 but it's not like people have to take this stuff ongoing.

1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:22.380
 This is really an attempt to tap into this NMDA receptor

1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:24.900
 that is related to neuroplasticity.

1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:30.560
 Both ketamine and PCP essentially act as antagonists,

1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:34.640
 which means they block the NMDA receptor.

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:36.680
 They do it through different methods,

1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:38.080
 non-competitive and competitive

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:40.680
 for you chemists and pharmacologists out there.

1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:42.280
 You can look it up if you like.

1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:45.120
 But what's therefore even more surprising

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:47.420
 is that every neuroscientist learns

1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:50.380
 that activation of the NMDA receptor,

1:25:50.380 --> 1:25:53.640
 not antagonism or blocking of the NMDA receptor,

1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:56.440
 leads to changes in neural circuitry in very profound ways.

1:25:56.440 --> 1:25:57.900
 In fact, experimentally,

1:25:57.900 --> 1:25:59.200
 and I've done these experiments myself,

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.400
 if you want to prevent plasticity,

1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:03.680
 you want to prevent an experience

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:05.180
 from reshaping neural circuitry,

1:26:05.180 --> 1:26:08.020
 you give an NMDA receptor blocker.

1:26:08.020 --> 1:26:09.200
 I've done that many times

1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:11.760
 in the course of my experimental neuroscience career,

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:12.880
 not to myself, obviously,

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:15.940
 but in the course of doing experiments.

1:26:16.820 --> 1:26:21.300
 So it's still a bit mysterious to me how this could work.

1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:22.140
 A couple of things,

1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:26.720
 one is this layer five activation is pretty interesting.

1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.280
 We're going to come back to layer five

1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.480
 when we talk about yet another emerging treatment

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:33.200
 for depression, which is psilocybin,

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:34.740
 so-called magic mushrooms,

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:38.460
 and the effects of psilocybin

1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:41.000
 on layer five neurons in the cortex.

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.600
 So there's a common theme emerging here,

1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:45.360
 which is that layer five activity in the cortex

1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:48.200
 may be important for rewiring the brain in certain ways

1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:53.200
 that can lead to recovery or to an alleviation

1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.400
 of some of the symptoms of major depression.

1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:59.400
 So if this is sounding a little bit vague to you,

1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:03.400
 it's because this is still truly experimental and new,

1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:05.600
 and still very much on the cutting edge

1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:08.440
 of what's happening now, we don't have all the answers.

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:10.520
 So if it sounds like I'm moving slowly through this

1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:12.780
 and I'm being extra careful about what I say,

1:27:12.780 --> 1:27:17.780
 you are correct, your antennae are correct in this case.

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:21.760
 I never want to misstep and say something that's not true,

1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:23.960
 but that's especially the case

1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.240
 when we're talking about experimental therapies and drugs,

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:28.220
 which formerly were taken as drugs of abuse,

1:27:28.220 --> 1:27:29.920
 which are now being used as drugs

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:31.920
 for therapeutic treatment in the clinic.

1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:35.840
 There is a very interesting study.

1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:38.640
 This was published in Science in 2019.

1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:40.340
 So these are very recent studies.

1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:44.440
 The last author on this is Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.

1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.920
 The title of the paper is

1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.340
 Sustained Rescue of Prefrontal Circuit Dysfunction

1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:52.160
 by Antidepressant-Induced Spine Formation.

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:54.160
 And here, when we hear spine,

1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:57.360
 we're not referring to spine as in your vertebrae

1:27:57.360 --> 1:27:59.920
 running down your spinal column.

1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:01.100
 We're talking about the spines,

1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:04.200
 which are these little protrusions on neurons.

1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:07.380
 Neurons are not smooth by any stretch.

1:28:07.380 --> 1:28:09.360
 If you zoom in on a neuron,

1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:10.440
 if you were to come to my lab

1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:13.120
 and look down the microscope at a neuron and zoom in on it,

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:14.440
 you'd find that some neurons are smooth,

1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:16.320
 but most neurons have these little protrusions

1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:18.400
 and those little protrusions are called spines.

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:22.000
 And those little spiny protrusions are little sites

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.900
 where neurons can reach out and form and receive

1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:27.760
 new synapses from neighboring neurons.

1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:29.880
 So they increase the surface area of a neuron

1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:31.960
 and allow new connections to be formed.

1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:36.340
 And so spine formation is synonymous with neuroplasticity,

1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:38.800
 which is synonymous with changes in circuit function,

1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:42.520
 which is synonymous with changes in the ways that we think,

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:45.160
 we feel, and we behave.

1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:47.920
 And what was shown in this study is really interesting.

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:49.880
 What they showed is that ketamine

1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:53.400
 can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly

1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:56.920
 by changing or increasing in this case,

1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:00.660
 the spines on these neurons in the prefrontal cortex.

1:29:00.660 --> 1:29:02.760
 And if that word prefrontal rings a bell,

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.680
 well, now you remember the phosphocreatine system,

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:08.560
 the ingestion of creatine monohydrate

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:12.340
 and the forebrain, activation of the forebrain

1:29:12.340 --> 1:29:16.520
 were related to in some way or another to relief

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:19.380
 or improvement of major depressive symptoms.

1:29:19.380 --> 1:29:21.800
 So we're starting to converge on a picture here

1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:25.400
 whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,

1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:27.360
 used in a therapeutic context,

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.540
 maybe increasing neuroplasticity,

1:29:30.540 --> 1:29:33.640
 literally the changing of neural circuits in the forebrain

1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:36.560
 somehow through dissociative states.

1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:38.640
 And I don't want to speculate too much

1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:40.600
 about how that might come about,

1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:44.720
 but one of the things that such a resounding

1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:47.600
 or repeating theme of major depression

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:50.060
 is that when you talk to somebody who has major depression,

1:29:50.060 --> 1:29:52.000
 it is a real downer.

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.200
 And I'm not being disparaging of those people,

1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:55.400
 but if you've ever had a conversation

1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:56.960
 with someone who's depressed,

1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:59.200
 they're always talking about how exhausted they are,

1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:01.140
 or in really severe cases,

1:30:01.140 --> 1:30:02.820
 they are not even responsive at all.

1:30:02.820 --> 1:30:06.480
 They just kind of stare at you blankly or they fall asleep.

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:08.160
 I mean, they're truly depressed.

1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:12.120
 Their system is lowered in terms of its activation state.

1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:14.900
 So I think that it's interesting

1:30:14.900 --> 1:30:18.040
 that the application of drugs

1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:20.680
 that allow people to separate from that state

1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:22.820
 of not caring or being uninterested

1:30:22.820 --> 1:30:24.720
 or unwilling to do anything

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:26.680
 is actually one of the paths to treatment.

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:29.260
 It's not always about just getting people peppy

1:30:29.260 --> 1:30:31.440
 and excited and happy.

1:30:31.440 --> 1:30:32.920
 There also seems to be a requirement

1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:36.360
 for getting them distanced from their own grief.

1:30:36.360 --> 1:30:38.680
 And this brings us back to something that we talked about

1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:40.840
 way back at the beginning of this episode,

1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:43.920
 which was this particular feature

1:30:43.920 --> 1:30:46.760
 of the anti-self confabulation,

1:30:46.760 --> 1:30:49.320
 that everything that happens is a reflection

1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:50.920
 that I should say for the depressed person,

1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:52.760
 that everything that happens is a reflection

1:30:52.760 --> 1:30:54.960
 of how life is bad and their experiences

1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:58.100
 just point to the fact that nothing is going to get better.

1:30:58.100 --> 1:31:00.080
 This is the common language of depression.

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.680
 If this is very depressing to hear me talk about,

1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:06.320
 it is heavy, and that's what it's like to hear these things.

1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:07.440
 It's even heavier, of course,

1:31:07.440 --> 1:31:09.480
 for somebody to experience them.

1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:14.480
 And those beliefs, those patterns of guilt and grief

1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:18.840
 and anhedonia and delusional anti-self confabulations,

1:31:18.840 --> 1:31:20.500
 those are the things that eventually,

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:22.120
 if they get severe enough,

1:31:22.120 --> 1:31:26.180
 start to convert into things like self-harm, mutilation,

1:31:26.180 --> 1:31:29.640
 and in the most tragic of cases, of course, suicide.

1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:33.400
 And so I think we can look to these treatments

1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:35.680
 such as ketamine and PCP,

1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:38.640
 but in particular ketamine and its use in the clinic

1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:41.080
 as ways for people to get distanced

1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:43.700
 from the negative affect that they feel

1:31:43.700 --> 1:31:46.600
 isn't just inside them or overwhelms them,

1:31:46.600 --> 1:31:49.280
 but that for the very severely depressed person,

1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:51.440
 they feel is them.

1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:54.000
 And we hear this sometimes, you are not your emotions.

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:55.320
 That's a statement that I've always been

1:31:55.320 --> 1:31:56.200
 a little bit challenged by.

1:31:56.200 --> 1:32:01.140
 I mean, yes, indeed, emotions are not who we are.

1:32:01.140 --> 1:32:03.120
 They are states that we go into and out of,

1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:04.940
 including happiness and sadness,

1:32:04.940 --> 1:32:07.880
 but they are very much a part of us

1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:08.920
 when we experience them.

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:11.200
 We don't experience them as next to us or behind us

1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:12.840
 or across the room from us.

1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:14.880
 We experience them as our emotions.

1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:17.680
 They are so much part and parcel

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:19.760
 with our experience of ourself

1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:22.300
 that a statement like we aren't our emotions

1:32:22.300 --> 1:32:24.120
 is a very hard statement to digest,

1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:26.000
 especially for the depressed person.

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.960
 And so I think that the NMDA receptor

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:32.480
 and its capacity to induce neuroplasticity circuit changes,

1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:33.880
 the fact that PCP and ketamine

1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:37.400
 are both showing activation of neural circuits

1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:40.120
 by way of suppressing activity of the NMDA receptor

1:32:40.120 --> 1:32:43.440
 and some of the positive or exciting therapeutic outcomes

1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:44.640
 that are coming from this

1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:47.640
 really point to the fact that ketamine and PCP

1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:51.200
 and removal of negative experiences

1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:53.680
 or the experience of a negative experience,

1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:55.080
 it's sort of getting meta there,

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:56.900
 but the experience of a negative experience

1:32:56.900 --> 1:32:59.320
 may be an important path by which

1:32:59.320 --> 1:33:00.720
 people treat their depression,

1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:02.600
 especially in its most severe forms

1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:04.560
 where people are veering towards

1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:07.480
 self-harm, mutilation, and suicide.

1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:08.880
 So you may have noticed a theme,

1:33:08.880 --> 1:33:11.080
 which is that certain categories of approaches

1:33:11.080 --> 1:33:12.040
 that we've been discussing

1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:14.680
 for offsetting the symptoms of depression,

1:33:14.680 --> 1:33:18.180
 such as exercise, ingesting EPAs,

1:33:18.180 --> 1:33:19.800
 reducing inflammation,

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:22.700
 or even the SSRIs for increasing serotonin,

1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:27.440
 focus on changing some core biological function,

1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:29.700
 like raising the amount of a chemical, serotonin,

1:33:29.700 --> 1:33:33.360
 or reducing the amount of inflammatory cytokines

1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:34.480
 in the brain and body.

1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:38.240
 And yet things like ketamine

1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:40.720
 focus more on rewiring circuitry,

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:42.080
 changing neural circuitry

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.760
 so that it functions better in the immediate

1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:46.400
 and hopefully in the long-term as well,

1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:48.040
 and keep people with major depression

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:49.960
 in what they call remission,

1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:52.120
 away from major depression.

1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:53.780
 Another category of treatments

1:33:53.780 --> 1:33:57.040
 that's being actively explored now in laboratories

1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:00.800
 and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics.

1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:03.800
 And that's a huge category of compounds.

1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:07.400
 However, one in particular, psilocybin,

1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:11.180
 is one that's being most intensely and actively pursued

1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:14.240
 for its capacity to treat major depressive disorder.

1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:15.800
 I want to be very clear

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.300
 that the work that I'm going to describe

1:34:17.300 --> 1:34:20.780
 is work that's being done in university settings,

1:34:20.780 --> 1:34:25.780
 university hospitals, by scientists and psychiatrists.

1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:28.240
 And these are clinical studies, clinical trials,

1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:30.360
 leading to peer-reviewed data.

1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:33.200
 And those are the data that we'll be discussing.

1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.480
 Some of the major luminaries in this area include,

1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:37.360
 of course, aren't limited to,

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:38.940
 but include people like Matthew Johnson,

1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:40.320
 who's at Johns Hopkins.

1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:41.640
 We'll discuss some of his work now.

1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:44.460
 And fortunate to say that he will be coming on the podcast

1:34:44.460 --> 1:34:47.120
 as a guest to describe the studies

1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:49.320
 in a variety of laboratories,

1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:52.700
 working on a variety of different psychedelic compounds.

1:34:52.700 --> 1:34:54.440
 But let's focus on psilocybin

1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:57.600
 for its capacity to rewire neural circuits

1:34:57.600 --> 1:34:59.280
 and alleviate depression.

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:04.280
 There have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years

1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:06.600
 that psilocybin has this capacity.

1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:07.680
 How does psilocybin work?

1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:11.580
 Well, psilocybin magic mushrooms, as it's sometimes called,

1:35:11.580 --> 1:35:16.580
 mainly works on what's called the serotonin 5H2A receptor

1:35:17.380 --> 1:35:19.980
 with some affinity for the 5HT1 receptor.

1:35:19.980 --> 1:35:20.820
 What does that mean?

1:35:20.820 --> 1:35:22.840
 Well, basically you've got a lot of different kinds

1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:24.000
 of serotonin receptors,

1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:25.400
 just as you have a lot of different kinds

1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:28.200
 of dopamine receptors or other types of receptors.

1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:30.280
 The advantage of having different receptors

1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:33.000
 expressed in different parts of the brain and body,

1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.540
 even on different parts of individual cells

1:35:35.540 --> 1:35:36.760
 in the brain and body,

1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:38.640
 is that the same compound serotonin

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:40.920
 can have a diverse set of effects

1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:42.540
 on different cells and tissues.

1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:45.680
 This is also the basis of some of the side effect profiles

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:50.040
 of SSRIs, because maybe, for instance,

1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:52.480
 we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine

1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:54.040
 will increase serotonin in one area,

1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:55.280
 but also in another area,

1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:57.500
 and then they will go have diverse effects

1:35:57.500 --> 1:35:58.780
 on different brain circuits

1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:00.860
 because of the variety of receptors.

1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:02.840
 Receptors are just like parking slots

1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:05.000
 where the molecule serotonin parks

1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.500
 and has different effects.

1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:11.500
 Well, psilocybin engages or increases serotonin transmission,

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:15.400
 meaning it increases the amount of serotonin,

1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:18.980
 mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors,

1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:21.200
 but where in the brain does it happen

1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:22.400
 and what are the major effects?

1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:23.840
 First, let's talk about the major effects,

1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.100
 because I think that's what people are interested in.

1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:27.600
 The study that I'd like to highlight

1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:28.940
 is a fairly recent one.

1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:32.840
 It was published in May of 2021

1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:37.240
 in Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry,

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:39.440
 so JAMA Psychiatry,

1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:42.440
 and it's entitled Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy

1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:45.800
 on Major Depressive Disorder, a Randomized Clinical Trial.

1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:49.040
 It's an absolutely beautiful study, a very important study.

1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:51.120
 It includes some of the luminaries in this area,

1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:54.440
 like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finnan, Roland Griffiths,

1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:55.320
 and others.

1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:57.160
 We will provide a link to this study.

1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:02.080
 It is available in its full form at zero cost

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:02.920
 if you want to read it.

1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:03.840
 It's got a lot of details,

1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:05.360
 so I'm just going to summarize a few things,

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:09.460
 but basically what they did was they screened for patients

1:37:09.460 --> 1:37:10.400
 to come into the clinic.

1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:11.420
 These were people that suffered

1:37:11.420 --> 1:37:13.840
 from major depressive disorder

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.840
 and administered either one or two rounds of psilocybin.

1:37:20.260 --> 1:37:22.600
 They used particular dosages that are listed in the study,

1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:23.440
 so you can look it up

1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:25.680
 if you're really interested in that level of detail.

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:29.260
 Typically, it was 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight,

1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:30.780
 so it depends on body weight,

1:37:30.780 --> 1:37:33.360
 or 30 milligrams of psilocybin

1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.920
 per 70 kilograms of body weight.

1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:38.120
 They were given in capsule form,

1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:39.600
 so people weren't eating the mushrooms.

1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:42.400
 This is obviously a very controlled study,

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:46.200
 and they want to control the dosages appropriately.

1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:48.600
 They were randomized to begin the treatment immediately

1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:50.760
 or after an eight-week delay.

1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:52.440
 They had all the appropriate control groups

1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:53.960
 that one would like to see.

1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:56.400
 What's really striking about this study

1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:00.720
 is that there was a very significant improvement

1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:04.320
 in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms

1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:09.160
 in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people

1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:11.100
 that were subjects in the study

1:38:11.100 --> 1:38:16.100
 who received the psilocybin treatment.

1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:19.840
 And whether or not it was 50 or whether or not it was 71%

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:23.080
 varied according to how long after the study

1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:25.400
 they maintained these antidepressant effects,

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:27.680
 whether or not they stayed in remission from the depression.

1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:31.140
 But these are really enormous and significant effects,

1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:35.640
 very exciting, and are pointing in the direction

1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:39.640
 of psilocybin very soon becoming a treatment

1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:41.720
 for various forms of depression,

1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:43.800
 including major depression.

1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:48.160
 Now, of course, this is limited to the laboratory at present.

1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:50.140
 There are a number of elements of these studies

1:38:50.140 --> 1:38:51.980
 that are important to take into consideration too,

1:38:51.980 --> 1:38:55.320
 which is that there are highly trained guides,

1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:58.600
 meaning people to direct people through the experience.

1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:00.640
 As Matthew Johnson has told me,

1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:03.600
 there is the occurrence from time to time

1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.360
 of people having so-called bad trips,

1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:07.960
 of having anxiety attacks during the hallucinations

1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:10.280
 and all that, and they have ways to mitigate that

1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:12.780
 and deal with that because the guides are trained.

1:39:12.780 --> 1:39:16.680
 They have all the sorts of medical monitoring devices

1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:19.560
 for heart rate and temperature and things that one

1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:21.960
 would like to see for a study like this,

1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:24.280
 because these are very powerful compounds.

1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:26.800
 I don't want to give away any elements of the discussion

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:29.460
 with Matthew Johnson because it will be released

1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:32.280
 in podcast form reasonably soon here,

1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:33.740
 the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:35.540
 But one of the things that came up

1:39:35.540 --> 1:39:37.120
 and is a fundamental question that I had

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:39.760
 that I think probably many of you are asking is,

1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:43.780
 does the experience that one has on these compounds

1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:45.440
 make a difference for whether or not somebody

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:47.240
 gains relief from depression

1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:50.760
 from these psilocybin journeys or not?

1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:52.780
 In other words, does it matter what they talk about?

1:39:52.780 --> 1:39:53.920
 Does it matter what they think about?

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.200
 Does it matter if they have a good trip or a bad trip?

1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.700
 And I don't want to hold you in too much suspense.

1:39:58.700 --> 1:40:00.960
 I'll let Matthew provide the more thorough answer,

1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:04.760
 but what's really interesting is there are some common

1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:09.140
 themes to psilocybin administration and experience

1:40:09.140 --> 1:40:11.440
 that lead to relief from depressive symptoms,

1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:15.840
 but they are subjectively, excuse me, subjectively

1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:20.480
 very varied, meaning that whether or not people feel

1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:22.520
 they had a good experience or a bad experience,

1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:24.600
 whether or not people thought about their parents

1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:27.440
 or thought about the color of the ceiling

1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:30.120
 doesn't seem to have too much of an impact

1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:32.820
 on whether or not they receive relief

1:40:32.820 --> 1:40:36.280
 during these studies, in these clinical studies.

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:39.120
 It seems like different people can have lots

1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:42.780
 of different experiences and still receive benefit.

1:40:42.780 --> 1:40:45.420
 And that points to something deeper.

1:40:45.420 --> 1:40:48.200
 It points to the fact that these drugs,

1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:49.800
 which is really what they are,

1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:53.800
 are rewiring neural circuitry in a common way

1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:56.960
 despite a diversity of experience while on the drug.

1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:58.720
 And that itself is really interesting.

1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.120
 And it takes us back to a place that we've been before

1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:04.080
 in this discussion, which is layer five of the cortex,

1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:06.520
 this area that ketamine seems to impact as well

1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:09.500
 by generating rhythms of, I mentioned one to three hertz

1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:13.240
 activity in layer five of certain areas of the cortex.

1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:17.480
 Well, the 5-HT1A receptor is known to be enriched

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:19.800
 in layer five of the cortex.

1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:23.520
 And layer five of the cortex is a very interesting area

1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:25.560
 because it's an area in which there's a lot

1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:27.320
 of lateral connectivity.

1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:30.640
 So connections between different brain areas laterally

1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:34.560
 generally is what allows us to merge different senses.

1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:37.020
 So for instance, when we hear a sound off to our right,

1:41:37.020 --> 1:41:39.200
 over here, we turn to our right,

1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:41.000
 there's a very hardwired response.

1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:42.680
 And typically we hear something off to our right,

1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:44.160
 we don't look to our left.

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:46.720
 That's how hardwired some of these circuits are.

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:49.340
 What appears to be happening is that the activation

1:41:49.340 --> 1:41:53.580
 of the serotonin system in 5-HT1A receptor in layer five

1:41:53.580 --> 1:41:57.440
 is offering up or providing an experience

1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:01.260
 whereby the lateral connections are able to engage

1:42:01.260 --> 1:42:03.840
 much more broadly than they would normally.

1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:07.120
 Now that also could be a bad thing.

1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:10.480
 And I asked Matt about this, that sounds kind of spooky.

1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:12.620
 I don't know that when I hear something off to my right

1:42:12.620 --> 1:42:13.840
 that I want to look off to my left,

1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:15.440
 that could be highly maladaptive,

1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:18.460
 especially if it's a car coming at me from my right.

1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:20.000
 That doesn't seem to be what's happening.

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.040
 It's not really rewiring these deeply reflexive circuits.

1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:27.680
 It's somehow rewiring associations between events,

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.240
 emotional events, past events, current events,

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:33.100
 and future events in ways that allow people

1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:35.720
 to get some sort of relief or distance

1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.140
 from these narratives, these depressive stories

1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:40.760
 about their past and present,

1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:42.920
 and allow them to see new opportunity

1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:44.460
 and optimism in the future.

1:42:44.460 --> 1:42:46.980
 That's really a fascinating thing

1:42:46.980 --> 1:42:48.400
 if you really think about it,

1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:51.200
 because I would have thought that simply

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:53.880
 by ramping up laterality of connections,

1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:56.040
 meaning the cross associations,

1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.640
 that things could either be rewired randomly

1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:01.240
 in ways that don't serve us,

1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:04.860
 or would perhaps just cause no effect at all.

1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:06.480
 So it's either going to be bad or neutral,

1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:08.680
 but that's not really the way things are turning out.

1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:10.600
 Again, these are highly controlled studies.

1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:13.160
 I do want to emphasize that ketamine, psilocybin,

1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:16.480
 these things are still illegal, most all places.

1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:19.160
 There are some regions and cities in the United States

1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:21.440
 where they are locally decriminalized,

1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:22.560
 but they are not legal.

1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:23.520
 They're still illegal.

1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:26.520
 So what we're referring to here are indeed clinical studies

1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:29.780
 in which people are taking them legally.

1:43:29.780 --> 1:43:32.880
 I think it's very likely we will see a shift

1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:35.400
 in the legislature around psychedelics,

1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:39.680
 and in particular psilocybin in the not too distant future.

1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:41.420
 And I think that for now,

1:43:41.420 --> 1:43:44.800
 what we should know is what Matt told me

1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:47.080
 and what you'll hear far more about,

1:43:48.140 --> 1:43:51.420
 which is that psilocybin, this one,

1:43:51.420 --> 1:43:54.360
 or in most cases, two dose treatments done

1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:57.600
 in a highly clinical setting, controlled setting,

1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:00.320
 with patients that are carefully selected,

1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:03.620
 can in many cases, the majority of people receive

1:44:03.620 --> 1:44:07.100
 and maintain relief from their depressive symptoms

1:44:07.100 --> 1:44:11.480
 simply through the experience of this psychedelic journey.

1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:13.560
 I did ask him about microdosing.

1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:16.760
 I made it sound as if I had never heard about it before.

1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:19.780
 Microdosing, not microdosing, microdosing.

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:22.660
 And his answer was interesting.

1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:25.480
 His answer was that the microdosing effects

1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:28.560
 don't seem to be nearly as impactful as some of these,

1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:31.320
 let's just call them what they are,

1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:34.480
 these kind of high amplitude sessions

1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:37.820
 that there are just one or two.

1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:40.720
 There are some studies ongoing where there's more than two,

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:43.120
 but that the microdosing doesn't seem to compare

1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:47.600
 to these macrodosing, I mentioned the dosages before,

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:49.640
 this 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms

1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:52.960
 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages

1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:55.960
 given several weeks apart.

1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:59.600
 So you'll hear more about microdosing and other psychedelics

1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:02.900
 and their impact on depressive states

1:45:02.900 --> 1:45:05.640
 and major depression in the episode with Matt.

1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:07.880
 But for the time being, it really seems as if,

1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:09.560
 again, we're looking at neuroplasticity,

1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:11.040
 we're coming back to layer five,

1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:13.060
 just like with ketamine and PCP,

1:45:13.060 --> 1:45:14.320
 we're hearing about layer five,

1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:15.940
 we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry,

1:45:15.940 --> 1:45:17.800
 we're hearing about a dissociation

1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:22.680
 or a distancing of oneself from these negative moods

1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:23.960
 and affects and narratives,

1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:28.840
 but there's a key distinction between the ketamine work

1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:30.120
 and the psilocybin work,

1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:31.520
 which is that in the ketamine work,

1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:34.580
 it really is about dissociating from experience

1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:36.800
 during the session with the psychiatrist,

1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:38.760
 whereas during the psilocybin journey,

1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:41.740
 it's really about immersing oneself in the experience

1:45:41.740 --> 1:45:43.840
 and being fully present to that experience.

1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:45.720
 That does seem to be an important component

1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:47.460
 and what the difference is there

1:45:47.460 --> 1:45:50.560
 and why they both seem to provide some relief

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:52.600
 from major depression

1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:53.480
 isn't clear.

1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:56.680
 I think most likely it takes us back to the fact that

1:45:57.940 --> 1:46:01.160
 this thing we call major depression clearly involves

1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:03.520
 serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine,

1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:04.520
 and in some individuals,

1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:07.900
 they may be more deficient in one or several of those

1:46:07.900 --> 1:46:09.740
 or all of those, whereas in other individuals,

1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:12.200
 it might be a different collection of chemicals.

1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:14.380
 And of course, there are a tremendous number

1:46:14.380 --> 1:46:18.600
 of other psychedelic compounds that people are exploring

1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:21.240
 for treatment of major depression,

1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:22.600
 but really psilocybin is the one

1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:24.560
 that we have the most data on.

1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:29.060
 MDMA has mainly been explored in the clinical realm

1:46:29.060 --> 1:46:30.240
 for treatment of trauma.

1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:34.440
 There are some trials ongoing for treatment of depression,

1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:38.160
 but the big breakthroughs seem to be happening

1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:40.400
 in the realm of trauma treatment,

1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:42.480
 the so-called MAPS group that's doing this,

1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:45.040
 again, legally in a clinical setting.

1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:45.880
 And there are other groups

1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:47.280
 that are starting to do it as well.

1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:49.520
 We are going to do an entire podcast episode

1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:52.200
 about MDMA and some related compounds,

1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:54.560
 so I'll save that discussion for then.

1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:57.320
 One of the most common questions I get for this podcast

1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:00.720
 is about different diets, different regimes,

1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:02.000
 different nutritional plans,

1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.960
 things like keto, ketogenic diet, or vegan diets,

1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:09.160
 or intermittent fasting, or the all-meat diet,

1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:11.760
 the so-called lion diet, et cetera.

1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:14.360
 There are actually really interesting data

1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:18.720
 relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder.

1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:21.640
 And I think we just need to frame this

1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:23.560
 by returning to something that was said earlier,

1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:26.680
 which is that the ingestion of carbohydrates,

1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:29.640
 in particular carbohydrates and some meats like turkey

1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:34.640
 that are rich in tryptophan, this precursor to serotonin,

1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:39.640
 are in many ways the self-medicating version

1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:41.720
 of depression treatment.

1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:44.300
 Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that people should use food

1:47:44.300 --> 1:47:46.080
 to medicate their depression.

1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:48.300
 Many people do that reflexively, however.

1:47:48.300 --> 1:47:50.240
 They reach for carbohydrate-rich foods

1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:51.600
 to blunt their cortisol,

1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:53.440
 because that's indeed what it does.

1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:56.080
 It blunts cortisol when you ingest high-carbohydrate foods,

1:47:56.080 --> 1:47:57.720
 in particular starchy foods,

1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:00.800
 and it does increase serotonin,

1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:03.840
 in particular if those foods, rather,

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:06.900
 are rich in the amino acid tryptophan.

1:48:06.900 --> 1:48:10.320
 Now, ingesting food is wonderful and important and great,

1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:12.380
 but ingesting excessive foods of any kinds,

1:48:12.380 --> 1:48:16.420
 carbohydrate or otherwise, is not healthy, of course.

1:48:16.420 --> 1:48:19.200
 There have been some explorations

1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:20.640
 of whether or not a vegan diet

1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:23.120
 can improve symptoms of depression.

1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.440
 Not a lot of data, not impressive data.

1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:27.700
 There have been very few controlled studies

1:48:27.700 --> 1:48:31.100
 looking at the carnivore all-meat diet.

1:48:31.100 --> 1:48:32.700
 On that, I think there are now some

1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:34.020
 that are starting to spin up,

1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:35.540
 meaning the studies are starting to spin up.

1:48:35.540 --> 1:48:39.120
 However, the ketogenic diet has been explored

1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:44.120
 for its ability to relieve certain symptoms of depression,

1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:49.120
 in particular to what's called maintain euthymia.

1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:51.840
 Euthymia is the kind of state of equilibrium

1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:55.060
 between a manic episode and a depressive episode

1:48:55.060 --> 1:48:56.380
 in a manic bipolar person.

1:48:56.380 --> 1:48:58.240
 We'll return to this more in a future episode.

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:01.720
 But basically, manics have highs and they have lows.

1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:04.360
 Bipolars either cycle back and forth really quickly,

1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:06.600
 so rapid cycling, bi-polars, or slope.

1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:09.240
 Some people, so really quickly can be day-to-day.

1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:11.160
 Other people, it's month-to-month or week-to-week.

1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:13.480
 They're going highs and lows.

1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:16.040
 And you hear about mania and you hear about dysphoria.

1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:19.160
 Euthymia is that kind of place in the middle

1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:22.840
 where people feel neither too high nor too low.

1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:25.180
 And there are some interesting studies

1:49:25.180 --> 1:49:26.840
 looking at the ketogenic diet

1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:29.720
 for maintaining euthymia in manic depressives,

1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:32.520
 but also in people with major depressive disorder.

1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:33.600
 Why would this work?

1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:36.600
 Well, we have to remember that the ketogenic diet

1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:41.440
 wasn't discovered so that self-appointed nutrition gurus

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:43.160
 could talk about it online,

1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:45.080
 or so that people could make money

1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:48.000
 selling anything related to ketosis.

1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000
 And here, I'm not disparaging of the ketogenic diets.

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.320
 Helped a lot of people.

1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:53.600
 The ketogenic diet was actually shown

1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:58.600
 to be medically relevant for its use to treat epilepsy.

1:49:59.900 --> 1:50:02.800
 It turns out that in epilepsy,

1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:05.280
 or in particular pediatric epilepsy,

1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:09.580
 that a ketogenic diet and the shift of brain metabolism

1:50:09.580 --> 1:50:12.840
 to predominantly one in which ketones are being metabolized

1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:17.720
 rather than more standard glucose type metabolism

1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:20.820
 can greatly reduce the number of epileptic seizures

1:50:20.820 --> 1:50:22.760
 that these children experience.

1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:24.600
 It's not always the case, but it's often the case.

1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:27.340
 And so you talk to a neurologist or a neurosurgeon

1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:31.360
 who's specialized in epilepsy,

1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:32.920
 in particular pediatric epilepsy,

1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:34.080
 and they'll tell you this,

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.520
 oh yeah, the ketogenic diet, in many cases,

1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:38.780
 not all can be very effective for this treatment.

1:50:38.780 --> 1:50:43.640
 How is it that a ketogenic diet reduces seizures?

1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:46.400
 Well, the way it reduces seizures

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:49.960
 is by increasing what's called GABA transmission.

1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:54.300
 GABA is a substance that is naturally released in our brain.

1:50:54.300 --> 1:50:56.400
 It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter,

1:50:56.400 --> 1:50:59.000
 meaning that when it's released into the synapse,

1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.760
 it has the tendency to reduce the firing,

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:04.760
 to reduce the electrical activity of the next neuron

1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:06.040
 or sets of neurons.

1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:09.500
 There are various compounds that increase GABA,

1:51:09.500 --> 1:51:10.920
 in particular, GABA in the forebrain.

1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:14.520
 One common example would be something like alcohol.

1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.920
 Drinking an alcoholic drink or two

1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:18.680
 will increase GABA transmission,

1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:22.960
 will ironically will lower your social inhibitions

1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:25.980
 by increasing your neurochemical inhibition.

1:51:25.980 --> 1:51:30.040
 It basically suppresses the self-monitoring pathways.

1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:32.440
 And if people drink enough, it will suppress all pathways

1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:34.840
 and people will urinate themselves and fall over.

1:51:34.840 --> 1:51:37.480
 It will eventually inhibit all sorts of pathways.

1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:41.240
 So the GABA system has a rich array of effects

1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:42.920
 all over the brain and body,

1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:47.160
 but alcohol tends to activate the release of GABA.

1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:49.520
 You might say, well, then why not just take alcohol

1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:50.360
 to suppress seizures?

1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:51.500
 Well, that would be a terrible idea

1:51:51.500 --> 1:51:54.040
 because there tends to be a rebound excitability

1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:57.680
 after alcohol stops having its effects

1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:58.880
 on the GABA receptors.

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:00.680
 And so then there's an excitability

1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:03.120
 for which an epilepsy would be terrible.

1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:07.120
 The reason why the epileptic diet is useful for epilepsy

1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:09.720
 is that increases the, what we call the tonic level,

1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:13.840
 the sort of the tide, the level of GABA in the brain,

1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:16.580
 and that suppresses some of the hyperexcitability

1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:20.160
 that is the characteristic feature of epilepsy.

1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:21.880
 And there are other drugs, for instance,

1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:26.600
 the benzodiazepines and things of the Xanax variety,

1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:30.080
 Valium and so forth, those increase GABA transmission.

1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:32.100
 Those drugs also have a lot of potential

1:52:32.100 --> 1:52:34.000
 for abuse and addiction, et cetera.

1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:35.960
 And they're problematic for other reasons.

1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:38.640
 But the ketogenic diet,

1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:40.920
 by way of increasing ketone metabolism

1:52:40.920 --> 1:52:44.560
 or shifting brain's metabolism over to ketones,

1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:49.560
 tends to modulate GABA such that GABA is more active

1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:54.000
 and adjust the so-called GABA glutamate balance.

1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:55.000
 This is getting technical,

1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:58.060
 but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter.

1:52:58.060 --> 1:52:59.760
 GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter

1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:02.480
 and their balance is vital for neuroplasticity,

1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:05.720
 for maintaining healthy levels of activity in the brain,

1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:06.800
 et cetera.

1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:10.120
 And so there is decent evidence

1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:13.340
 that people with major depressive disorders,

1:53:13.340 --> 1:53:17.160
 in particular, the people with major depressive disorders

1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:20.760
 that are refractory, meaning they don't respond

1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:25.600
 to classical antidepressants, can benefit, it seems,

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:28.820
 from the ketogenic diet.

1:53:28.820 --> 1:53:30.240
 Now, this is not always the case,

1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:31.600
 but for those of you out there

1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:33.840
 who are struggling with major depression

1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:35.080
 and for which drugs have not worked,

1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:36.380
 please talk to your psychiatrist.

1:53:36.380 --> 1:53:38.360
 I don't know how many of them are up on the literature

1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:42.840
 about the ketogenic diet or the EPAs and the rest.

1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:45.480
 Psychiatrists vary in terms of how involved

1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:47.400
 in the current literature they tend to be,

1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:49.880
 but there are many excellent psychiatrists out there.

1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:51.320
 Most of them, in my experience,

1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:55.840
 are actually quite avid learners about what's happening

1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:59.240
 and what's new in this realm that they call psychiatry.

1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:02.160
 So it's really interesting that eating

1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:04.680
 in a particular way, lowering carbohydrates

1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:08.120
 to the point where you rely on ketogenic metabolism

1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:10.480
 in the brain, increases GABA,

1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:13.800
 and can provide some relief for depressive symptoms,

1:54:13.800 --> 1:54:16.840
 and that in particular, that seems to have positive effects

1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:18.120
 in people that are refractory

1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:21.040
 or don't respond to classic antidepressants,

1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:24.040
 and that would include things like fluoxetine, et cetera.

1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:26.700
 I'll make one final point about ketogenic diets

1:54:26.700 --> 1:54:27.920
 and GABA and depression,

1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:31.720
 which is that it's also been shown that for people

1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:34.800
 that respond well to these drugs

1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:37.240
 that impact the serotonin system, dopamine system,

1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:40.480
 or norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet there

1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.360
 may improve the ability for those drugs

1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:45.560
 to work at lower dosages,

1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:47.040
 which is reminiscent of what we saw

1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:49.120
 with the EPA supplementation.

1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.820
 So today we've covered what at least feels to me

1:54:51.820 --> 1:54:53.840
 like a tremendous amount of material.

1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:56.520
 This topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic

1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:58.160
 to try and get our arms around.

1:54:58.160 --> 1:54:59.520
 We talked about the symptomology,

1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:01.420
 we talked about some of the underlying neurochemistry

1:55:01.420 --> 1:55:04.120
 and biology, and then we talked about approaches

1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:06.200
 to deal with it that are really grounded

1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:08.680
 in the neurochemistry and biology.

1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:11.480
 I just want to recap a few of those tools

1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:12.780
 and what those things are.

1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:16.360
 First of all, we talked about making the effort

1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:19.080
 to not overwhelm the pleasure system.

1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:20.640
 That might seem counterintuitive,

1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.680
 to not overly seek out pleasure

1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:26.480
 or else one can find themselves in a place of depression.

1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:29.040
 I mentioned way back at the beginning of the episode,

1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:32.720
 a young man who I know to be really struggling

1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:36.020
 with depression and it is thought,

1:55:36.020 --> 1:55:37.460
 and we don't know for sure,

1:55:37.460 --> 1:55:39.220
 but it is thought that some of that depression

1:55:39.220 --> 1:55:42.600
 was probably triggered by an overindulgence in video games

1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:45.360
 and other highly dopaminergic activities

1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:48.660
 to the point where those activities eventually were countered

1:55:48.660 --> 1:55:52.680
 by the pain balance that Dr. Anilemke described.

1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:57.160
 And he now has to do those activities repeatedly

1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:00.040
 and for many, many hours each day just to feel okay,

1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:02.420
 not even to derive pleasure from them.

1:56:02.420 --> 1:56:05.960
 And worse, many other activities,

1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:09.520
 practically all other activities have lost their zest,

1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:10.680
 they've lost their excitement

1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:13.040
 and his sense of pleasure for them.

1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:15.920
 And so there's a really active campaign now

1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:17.820
 to reset that system.

1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:22.020
 So number one, don't overwhelm your pleasure centers,

1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:24.080
 either through activities or compounds.

1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:25.400
 It might seem counterintuitive,

1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:28.540
 but you're setting yourself up for anhedonia and depression

1:56:28.540 --> 1:56:29.380
 if you do that.

1:56:29.380 --> 1:56:31.000
 It's not just about addiction, that too,

1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:32.280
 but it's also about setting yourself

1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:35.160
 for anhedonia and depression.

1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:37.440
 How often can you engage in these activities?

1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:39.400
 Well, that's going to differ from person to person,

1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:40.880
 everyone's slightly different,

1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:43.480
 but you should really mind your extreme highs

1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:46.280
 and your extreme lows and be cautious about those.

1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:49.200
 We'll probably have Dr. Lemke on again at a future time

1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:51.300
 to try and get some more specifics about that.

1:56:51.300 --> 1:56:54.640
 But if you do feel like you need to reset that system,

1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:58.940
 it really does seem like a 30-day complete detox

1:56:58.940 --> 1:57:01.120
 from whatever activity or substance that is,

1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.840
 and ideally it doesn't continue after that 30 days,

1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:06.880
 especially in conditions of drugs of abuse.

1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:10.080
 Second of all, talked about the norepinephrine system

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.880
 and how the norepinephrine system is really deficient

1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:17.760
 in many forms of major depression and in depression.

1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:20.540
 There is now more deliberate pursuit

1:57:20.540 --> 1:57:23.080
 of norepinephrine-inducing activities that are healthy,

1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:26.240
 that aren't adrenaline-seeking per se,

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.500
 things like cold showers,

1:57:27.500 --> 1:57:31.520
 things like particular patterns of breathing

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:35.260
 that engage and tend to make us more alert,

1:57:35.260 --> 1:57:37.600
 things like exercise that will increase

1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:39.140
 our levels of noradrenaline.

1:57:39.140 --> 1:57:42.040
 I'd be remiss if I said that these activities

1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:45.340
 could completely eliminate depressive symptoms

1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:46.880
 in people with major depressive disorder.

1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:47.860
 I don't think that's the case.

1:57:47.860 --> 1:57:48.880
 And again, I want to acknowledge

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.880
 that people with major depressive symptoms

1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:53.960
 often don't have the energy, the willingness,

1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:57.120
 or the capacity to engage in some of these activities,

1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:00.000
 but things like cold showers, deliberate cold showers,

1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.320
 things like regular exercise,

1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:05.140
 they aren't just feel-good activities.

1:58:05.140 --> 1:58:07.720
 They actually engage the norepinephrine system

1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:09.140
 and keep that system tuned up

1:58:09.140 --> 1:58:11.740
 and allow us to increase our norepinephrine levels at will

1:58:11.740 --> 1:58:13.020
 on a regular basis.

1:58:13.020 --> 1:58:15.420
 And their mood-enhancing effects are real effects

1:58:15.420 --> 1:58:17.840
 that at the level of neurochemistry.

1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:20.200
 Then we talked about EPAs, these essential fatty acids,

1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:23.080
 and it's clear that for most people,

1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:24.880
 getting above 1,000 milligrams

1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:28.280
 and probably even closer to 2,000 milligrams per day of EPAs

1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:29.500
 can be beneficial for mood,

1:58:29.500 --> 1:58:31.840
 especially in attempts to treat

1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:34.640
 or offset major depressive disorder.

1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:35.600
 Are there side effects?

1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:37.820
 Well, you need to explore those for yourself

1:58:37.820 --> 1:58:38.660
 and with your doctor.

1:58:38.660 --> 1:58:41.360
 Everyone has a different health background.

1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:43.880
 You know, for the margins of safety for most people

1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:45.880
 will probably be quite large,

1:58:45.880 --> 1:58:48.500
 but for some people that might not be the case.

1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:50.960
 So definitely check with your physician.

1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.360
 We also talked about exercise

1:58:52.360 --> 1:58:54.800
 and how EPA and exercise on a regular basis

1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:57.160
 can offset these inflammatory pathways.

1:58:57.160 --> 1:58:58.200
 I want to mention something

1:58:58.200 --> 1:58:59.680
 I've mentioned on a previous podcast,

1:58:59.680 --> 1:59:02.120
 but in terms of keeping the inflammatory,

1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:04.320
 all these molecules that create inflammation

1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:07.020
 and then the inflammation can limit the amount of serotonin

1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:08.640
 through the pathways we described.

1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:12.720
 In order to do that, it's also very, very useful

1:59:12.720 --> 1:59:16.040
 to ingest two to four servings of fermented foods

1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:17.920
 on a daily basis or near daily basis.

1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:19.920
 These are data that were published by the Sonnenberg Lab

1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:22.040
 at Stanford recently in the journal Cell,

1:59:22.040 --> 1:59:24.240
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:27.600
 that ingestion of these fermented foods

1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:31.360
 really keeps the gut microbiome tuned up, so to speak,

1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:34.160
 well in order to offset these inflammatory cytokines,

1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:35.780
 keeping inflammation at bay.

1:59:35.780 --> 1:59:38.040
 It just turns out to be a really good thing

1:59:38.040 --> 1:59:40.760
 in order to keep our mood in a good place.

1:59:40.760 --> 1:59:42.640
 So EPA, exercise, fermented foods,

1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:45.860
 creatine as a potential source of relief from depression

1:59:45.860 --> 1:59:49.320
 or offsetting or keeping us away from major depression

1:59:49.320 --> 1:59:50.840
 or relapse into depression.

1:59:50.840 --> 1:59:53.600
 And then we talked about the prescription compounds

1:59:53.600 --> 1:59:55.080
 and the compounds that are being used

1:59:55.080 --> 1:59:56.540
 mainly in the course of studies

1:59:56.540 --> 1:59:58.500
 and of psychiatry and depression,

1:59:58.500 --> 2:00:01.680
 things like ketamine, PCP, psilocybin and related compounds.

2:00:01.680 --> 2:00:03.480
 And then lastly, we talked about ketosis,

2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:04.940
 which may not be right for everybody,

2:00:04.940 --> 2:00:08.040
 but might be right for certain individuals out there

2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:09.440
 who are grappling with this.

2:00:10.440 --> 2:00:11.960

2:00:56.520 --> 2:01:00.000
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.840
 And there you can support the podcast

2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:03.800
 at any level that you like.

2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:05.440
 Throughout the course of today's episode

2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:08.240
 and in previous episodes, I mentioned supplements.

2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:10.540
 That may be appropriate for you.

2:01:10.540 --> 2:01:12.860
 If you want to check out the supplements that I take,

2:01:12.860 --> 2:01:17.360
 you can go to thorn.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:22.360
 That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:25.240
 There, you can see the supplements I take.

2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:27.240
 If you want to try any of those supplements,

2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:29.160
 you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:32.000
 And if you navigate from that location in the website

2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:33.960
 to any other locations in the Thorne site,

2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:36.640
 you will also get 20% off any of the other supplements

2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:37.800
 that Thorne makes.

2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:38.860
 We partnered with Thorne

2:01:38.860 --> 2:01:41.120
 because they have the absolutely highest levels

2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.960
 of stringency in terms of the quality and quantity

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:47.360
 of the supplements that they put in their formulations.

2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:48.540
 And last but not least,

2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:50.920
 I want to thank you for embarking on this journey

2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:53.120
 of trying to understand what is depression,

2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.480
 how does it work, and how to treat it.

2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.480
 And thank you for your interest in science.

2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:02.480
 I'll see you next time.
